<span id="iv.lxxxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c15"><span
id="iv.lxxxiv-p1.1"></span>Homily LXXXII.</span>

<span id="iv.lxxxiv-p2"></span> <span id="iv.lxxxiv-p2.1"></span> <span
class="c1"><span id="iv.lxxxiv-p2.2"></span>[John xvii.
14](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#014.md)<span
id="iv.lxxxiv-p2.3"></span></span>

<span id="iv.lxxxiv-p3"></span>“I have given them Thy word; and the
world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am
not of the world.”

<span id="iv.lxxxiv-p4"></span> \[1.\] <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.lxxxiv-p4.1"></span>When</span> having become virtuous we are
persecuted by the wicked, or when being desirous of virtue we are mocked
at by them, let us not be distracted or angry. For this is the natural
course of things, and everywhere virtue is wont to engender hatred from
wicked men. For envying those who desire to live properly, and thinking
to prepare an excuse for themselves if they can overthrow the credit of
others, they hate them as having pursuits opposite to their own, and use
every means to shame their way of life. But let not us grieve, for this
is a mark of virtue. Wherefore Christ also saith, “If ye were of the
world, the world would love its own.” ( [John
15.19](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#019.md)<span id="iv.lxxxiv-p4.2"></span>
.) And in another place again, “Woe unto you when all men shall speak
well of you.” ( [Luke vi. 26](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#026.md) <span
id="iv.lxxxiv-p4.3"></span> .) Wherefore also He saith here, “I have
given them Thy word, and the world hath hated them.” Again He telleth
the reason for which they were worthy to obtain much care from the
Father; “For Thy sake,” He saith, “they have been hated, and for Thy
word’s sake”; so that they would be entitled to all providential care.

<span id="iv.lxxxiv-p5"></span> [John
17.15](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#015.md)<span id="iv.lxxxiv-p5.1"></span>
. “I pray not that Thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that
Thou shouldest keep them from the evil.”

<span id="iv.lxxxiv-p6"></span> Again He simplifieth  <span
id="fr_2348"></span>[2349](#fn_2348.md) His language; again He rendereth it
more clear; which is the act of one <span id="page_301">p. 301</span>
<span id="iv.lxxxiv-Page_301"></span> showing, by making entreaty for
them with exactness, nothing else but this, that He hath a very tender
care for them. Yet He Himself had told them, that the Father would do
all things whatsoever they should ask. How then doth He here pray for
them? As I said, for no other purpose than to show His love.

<span id="iv.lxxxiv-p8"></span> [John
17.16](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#016.md)<span id="iv.lxxxiv-p8.1"></span>
. “They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.”

<span id="iv.lxxxiv-p9"></span>How then saith He in another place,
“Which Thou gavest Me out of the world; Thine they were”? ( [John
17.6](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#006.md)<span id="iv.lxxxiv-p9.1"></span>
.) There He speaketh of their nature; here of wicked actions. And He
putteth together a long encomium of them; first, that “they were not of
the world”; then, that “the Father Himself had given them”; and that
“they had kept His word;” and that on this account “they were hated.”
And if He saith, “As I am not of the world,” be not troubled; for the
“as” is not here expressive of unvarying exactness. For as, when in the
case of Him and the Father the “as” is used, a great Equality is
signified, because of the Relationship in Nature; so when it is used of
us and Him, the interval is great, because of the great and infinite
interval between the respective natures. For if He “did no sin, neither
was guile found in His mouth” ( [1 Pet. ii.
22](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#022.md) <span id="iv.lxxxiv-p9.2"></span>
), how could the Apostles be reckoned equal to Him? What is it then that
He saith, “They are not of the world”? “They look to another world, they
have nothing common with earth, but are become citizens of heaven.” And
by these words He showeth His love, when He commendeth them to the
Father, and committeth them to Him who begat Him. When He saith, “Keep
them,” He doth not speak merely of delivering them from dangers, but
also with regard to their continuance in the faith. Wherefore He addeth,

<span id="iv.lxxxiv-p10"></span> [John
17.17](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#017.md)<span
id="iv.lxxxiv-p10.1"></span> . “Sanctify them through Thy truth.” “Make
them holy by the gift of the Spirit, and of right doctrines.” As when He
saith, “Ye are clean through the word which I spake unto you” ( [John
15.3](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#003.md)<span id="iv.lxxxiv-p10.2"></span>
), so now He saith the same thing, “Instruct them, teach them the
truth.” “And yet He saith that the Spirit doth this. How then doth He
now ask it from the Father?” That thou mayest again learn their equality
of Honor. For right doctrines asserted concerning God sanctify the soul.
And if He saith that they are sanctified by the word, marvel not. And to
show that He speaketh of doctrines, He addeth,

<span id="iv.lxxxiv-p11"></span>“Thy word is truth.”

<span id="iv.lxxxiv-p12"></span>That is, “there is no falsehood in it,
and all that is said in it must needs come to pass”; and again, it
signifieth nothing typical or bodily. As also Paul saith concerning the
Church, that He hath sanctified it by the Word. For the Word of God is
wont also to cleanse. ( [Eph. v. 26](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#026.md)
<span id="iv.lxxxiv-p12.1"></span> .) Moreover, the, “sanctify them,”
seems to me to signify something else, such as this, “Set them apart for
the Word and for preaching.” And this is made plain from what follows.
For, He saith,

<span id="iv.lxxxiv-p13"></span> [John
17.17](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#017.md)<span
id="iv.lxxxiv-p13.1"></span> . “As Thou hast sent Me into the world,
even so have I also sent them into the world.”

<span id="iv.lxxxiv-p14"></span>As Paul also saith, “Having put in us
the word of reconciliation.” ( [2 Cor. v.
19](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#019.md) <span id="iv.lxxxiv-p14.1"></span>
.) For the same end for which Christ came, for the same did these take
possession of the world. In this place again the “as” is not put to
signify resemblance in the case of Himself and the Apostles; for how was
it possible for men to be sent otherwise? But it was His custom to speak
of the future as having come to pass.  <span
id="fr_2349"></span>[2350](#fn_2349.md)

<span id="iv.lxxxiv-p16"></span> [John
17.19](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#019.md)<span
id="iv.lxxxiv-p16.1"></span> . “And for their sakes I sanctify Myself,
that they also might be sanctified in the truth.”

<span id="iv.lxxxiv-p17"></span> What is, “I sanctify Myself”? “I offer
to Thee a sacrifice.” Now all sacrifices are called “holy,” and those
are specially called “holy things,” which are laid up for God. For
whereas of old in type the sanctification was by the sheep, but now it
is not  <span id="fr_2350"></span>[2351](#fn_2350.md) in type, but by the
truth itself, He therefore saith, “That they may be sanctified in Thy
truth.” “For I both dedicate them to Thee, and make them an offering”;
this He saith, either because their Head was being made so,  <span
id="fr_2351"></span>[2352](#fn_2351.md) or because they also were
sacrificed; for, “Present,” it saith, “your bodies a living sacrifice,
holy” ( [Rom. xii. 1](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#001.md) <span
id="iv.lxxxiv-p19.4"></span> ); and, “We were counted as sheep for the
slaughter.” ( [Ps. xliv. 22](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#022.md) <span
id="iv.lxxxiv-p19.5"></span> .) And He maketh them; without death, a
sacrifice and offering; for that He alluded to His own sacrifice, when
He said, “I sanctify,” is clear from what follows.

<span id="iv.lxxxiv-p20"></span> [John
17.20](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#020.md)<span
id="iv.lxxxiv-p20.1"></span> . “Neither pray I for these alone, but for
them also who shall believe.”  <span
id="fr_2352"></span>[2353](#fn_2352.md)

<span id="iv.lxxxiv-p22"></span>\[2.\] For since He was dying for them,
and said, that “For their sakes I sanctify Myself,” lest any one should
think that He did this for the Apostles only, He added, “Neither pray I
for these only, but for them also who believe on Me through their word.”
By this again He revived their souls, showing that the disciples should
be many. For because He made common what they possessed peculiarly, He
comforteth them by showing that they were being made the cause of the
salvation of others.

<span id="iv.lxxxiv-p23"></span> After having thus spoken concerning
their salvation, and their being sanctified by faith and the Sacrifice,
He afterwards speaketh of concord, and finally closeth his discourse
with this, having begun with it and ended  <span
id="fr_2353"></span>[2354](#fn_2353.md) in it. For at <span
id="page_302">p. 302</span> <span id="iv.lxxxiv-Page_302"></span> the
beginning He saith, “A new commandment I give unto you” ( [John
13.34](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#034.md)<span
id="iv.lxxxiv-p24.4"></span> ); and here,

<span id="iv.lxxxiv-p25"></span> [John
17.21](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#021.md)<span
id="iv.lxxxiv-p25.1"></span> . “That they all may be one, as Thou,
Father, art in Me and I in Thee.”

<span id="iv.lxxxiv-p26"></span>Here again the “as” doth not denote
exact similarity in their case, (for it was not possible for them in so
great a degree,) but only as far as was possible for men. Just as when
He saith “Be ye merciful, as your Father.” ( [Luke vi.
36](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#036.md) <span id="iv.lxxxiv-p26.1"></span>
.)

<span id="iv.lxxxiv-p27"></span> But what is, “In Us”?  <span
id="fr_2354"></span>[2355](#fn_2354.md) In the faith which is on Us.
Because nothing so offends all men as divisions, He provideth that they
should be one. “What then,” saith some one, “did He effect this?”
Certainly He effected it. For all who believe through the Apostles are
one, though some from among them were torn away. Nor did this escape His
knowledge, He even foretold it, and showed that it proceeded from men’s
slack-mindedness.

<span id="iv.lxxxiv-p29"></span>“That the world may believe that Thou
hast sent Me.”

<span id="iv.lxxxiv-p30"></span>As He said in the beginning, “By this
shall all men know that ye are My disciples, if ye love one another.”
And how should they hence believe? “Because,” He saith, “Thou art a God
of peace.” If therefore they observe the same as those of whom they have
learnt, their hearers shall know the teacher by the disciples, but if
they quarrel, men shall deny that they are the disciples of a God of
peace, and will not allow that I, not being peaceable, have been sent
from Thee. Seest thou how, unto the end, He proveth His unanimity with
the Father?

<span id="iv.lxxxiv-p31"></span> [John
17.22](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#022.md)<span
id="iv.lxxxiv-p31.1"></span> . “And the glory which Thou gavest Me, I
have given them.”  <span id="fr_2355"></span>[2356](#fn_2355.md)

<span id="iv.lxxxiv-p33"></span> That by miracles, that by doctrines,
 <span id="fr_2356"></span>[2357](#fn_2356.md) and, that they should be of
one soul; for this is glory, that they should be one, and greater even
than miracles. As men  <span id="fr_2357"></span>[2358](#fn_2357.md) admire
God because there is no strife or discord in That Nature, and this is
His greatest glory, “so too let these,” He saith, “from this cause
become glorious.” “And how,” saith some one, “doth He ask the Father to
give this to them, when He saith that He Himself giveth it?” Whether His
discourse be concerning miracles, or unanimity, or peace, He is seen
Himself to have given these things to them; whence it is clear that the
petition is made for the sake of their comfort.

<span id="iv.lxxxiv-p36"></span> [John
17.23](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#023.md)<span
id="iv.lxxxiv-p36.1"></span> . “I in them, and Thou in Me.”

<span id="iv.lxxxiv-p37"></span> “How gave He the glory?” By being in
them, and having the Father with Him, so as to weld them  <span
id="fr_2358"></span>[2359](#fn_2358.md) together. But in another place He
speaketh not so; He saith not that the Father cometh by Him, but, “that
He and the Father come, and take up their abode with him,”  <span
id="fr_2359"></span>[2360](#fn_2359.md) “there” removing the suspicion of
Sabellius, “here” that of Arius.  <span
id="fr_2360"></span>[2361](#fn_2360.md)

<span id="iv.lxxxiv-p41"></span>“That they may be made perfect in one,
and that the world may know that Thou hast sent Me.” ( [John
14.23](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#023.md)<span
id="iv.lxxxiv-p41.1"></span> .)

<span id="iv.lxxxiv-p42"></span> He saith these latter words immediately
after the other, to show that peace hath more power to attract men than
a miracle; for as it is the nature of strife  <span
id="fr_2361"></span>[2362](#fn_2361.md) to separate, so it is that of
agreement to weld together.

<span id="iv.lxxxiv-p44"></span> “And I have  <span
id="fr_2362"></span>[2363](#fn_2362.md) loved them as Thou hast loved Me.”

<span id="iv.lxxxiv-p46"></span> Here again the “as” means, as far as it
is possible for a man to be loved; and the sure proof of His love is His
giving Himself for them. After having told them that they shall be in
safety, that they shall not be overturned, that they shall be holy, that
many shall believe through them, that they shall enjoy great glory, that
not He alone loved them, but the Father also; He next telleth them of
what shall be after their sojourning here,  <span
id="fr_2363"></span>[2364](#fn_2363.md) concerning the prizes and crowns
laid up for them.

<span id="iv.lxxxiv-p48"></span> [John
17.24](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#024.md)<span
id="iv.lxxxiv-p48.1"></span> . “Father,” He saith, “I will that they
also whom Thou hast given Me, be with Me where I am.”

<span id="iv.lxxxiv-p49"></span>“Then dost Thou gain by prayer, and dost
Thou not yet possess that concerning which they enquired continually,
saying, ‘Whither goest Thou?’ What sayest Thou? How then didst Thou say
to them, ‘Ye shall sit upon twelve thrones’? ( [Matt. xix.
28](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#028.md) <span id="iv.lxxxiv-p49.1"></span>
.) How didst Thou promise other things more and greater?” Seest thou
that He saith all  <span id="fr_2364"></span>[2365](#fn_2364.md) in the way
of condescension? since how would He have said, “Thou shalt follow
afterwards”? ( [John 13.36](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#036.md)<span
id="iv.lxxxiv-p50.3"></span> .) But He speaketh thus with a view to a
fuller conviction and demonstration of His love.

<span id="iv.lxxxiv-p51"></span>“That they may behold My glory which
Thou hast given Me.”

<span id="iv.lxxxiv-p52"></span> This again is a sign of His being of
one mind with the Father, of a higher character than those former, for
He saith, “Before  <span id="fr_2365"></span>[2366](#fn_2365.md) the
foundation of the world,” yet hath it also a certain condescension; for,
“Thou hast given Me,” He saith. Now if this be not the case, I would
gladly ask the gainsayers a question. He that giveth, giveth to one
subsisting;  <span id="fr_2366"></span>[2367](#fn_2366.md) did the Father
then, having first begotten the Son, afterwards give Him glory, having
before allowed Him to be without glory? And how could this be
reasonable? Seest that the “He gave,” is, “He begot”?

<span id="iv.lxxxiv-p55"></span>\[3.\] But why said He not, “That they
may share My glory,” instead of, “That they may be <span
id="page_303">p. 303</span> <span id="iv.lxxxiv-Page_303"></span> hold
My glory”? Here He implieth, that all that rest is, the looking on the
Son of God. This certainly it is which causes them to be glorified; as
Paul saith, “With open face mirroring the glory of the Lord.” ( [2 Cor.
iii. 18](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#018.md) <span
id="iv.lxxxiv-p55.1"></span> .) For as they who look on the sunbeams,
and enjoy a very clear atmosphere, draw their enjoyment from their
sight, so then also, and in much greater degree, this will cause us
pleasure.  <span id="fr_2367"></span>[2368](#fn_2367.md) At the same time
also He showeth, that what they should behold was not the body then
seen, but some awful Substance.

<span id="iv.lxxxiv-p57"></span> [John
17.25](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#025.md)<span
id="iv.lxxxiv-p57.1"></span> . “O righteous Father, the world hath not
known Thee.”  <span id="fr_2368"></span>[2369](#fn_2368.md)

<span id="iv.lxxxiv-p59"></span> What meaneth this? What connection hath
it? He here showeth that no man knoweth God, save those only who have
come to know the Son. And what He saith is of this kind: “I wished all
to be so,  <span id="fr_2369"></span>[2370](#fn_2369.md) yet they have not
known Thee, although they had no complaint against Thee.” For this is
the meaning of, “O righteous Father.” And here He seemeth to me to speak
these words, as vexed that they would not know One so just and good. For
since the Jews had said that they knew God, but that He knew Him not, at
this He aimeth, saying, “For Thou lovedst Me before the foundation of
the world”; thus putting together a defense against the accusations of
the Jews. For how could He who had received glory, who was loved before
the foundation of the world, who desired to have them as witnesses of
that glory, how could He be opposed to the Father? “This then is not
true which the Jews say, that they know Thee, and that I know Thee not;
on the contrary, I know Thee, and they have not known Thee.”

<span id="iv.lxxxiv-p61"></span>“And these have known that Thou hast
sent Me.”

<span id="iv.lxxxiv-p62"></span>Seest thou that He alludeth to those,
who said that He was not from God, and all is finally summed up to meet
this argument?

<span id="iv.lxxxiv-p63"></span> [John
17.26](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#026.md)<span
id="iv.lxxxiv-p63.1"></span> . “And I have declared unto them Thy Name,
and will declare it.”

<span id="iv.lxxxiv-p64"></span>“Yet thou sayest that perfect knowledge
is from the Spirit.” “But the things of the Spirit are Mine.”

<span id="iv.lxxxiv-p65"></span> “That the love wherewith Thou hast
loved Me may remain  <span id="fr_2370"></span>[2371](#fn_2370.md) in them,
and I in them.”

<span id="iv.lxxxiv-p67"></span> “For if they learn who Thou art, then
they shall know that I am not separated from Thee, but one of the
greatly beloved, and a true Son, and closely knit to Thee. And those who
are rightly persuaded of this, will keep both the faith which is on Me
and perfect love; and while they love as they ought, I remain in them.”
Seest thou how He hath arrived  <span
id="fr_2371"></span>[2372](#fn_2371.md) at a good end, finishing off the
discourse with love, the mother of all blessings?

<span id="iv.lxxxiv-p69"></span>\[4.\] Let us then believe and love God,
that it may not be said of us, “They profess that they know God, but in
their works they deny Him.” ( [Tit. i.
16](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#016.md) <span id="iv.lxxxiv-p69.1"></span>
.) And again, “He hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.”
( [1 Tim. v. 8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#008.md) <span
id="iv.lxxxiv-p69.2"></span> .) For when he  <span
id="fr_2372"></span>[2373](#fn_2372.md) helps his domestics and kinsmen and
strangers, while thou dost not even succor those who are related to thee
by family, what will henceforth be thy excuse, when God is blasphemed
and insulted by reason of thee? Consider what opportunities of doing
good God hath given to us. “Have mercy on one,” He saith, “as a kinsman,
on another as a friend, on another as a neighbor, on another as a
citizen, on another as a man.” And if none of these things hold thee,
but thou breakest through all bonds, hear from Paul, that thou art
“worse than an infidel”; for he having heard nothing of almsgiving, or
of heavenly things, hath overshot thee in love for man; but thou who art
bidden to love thy very enemies, lookest upon thy friends as enemies,
and art more careful of thy money than of their bodies. Yet the money by
being spent will sustain no injury, but thy brother if neglected will
perish. What madness then to be careful of money, and careless about
one’s kindred? Whence hath this craving for riches burst in upon us?
 <span id="fr_2373"></span>[2374](#fn_2373.md) Whence this inhumanity and
cruelty? For if any one could, as though seated on the highest bench of
a theater, look down upon all the world,—or rather, if you will, let us
for the present take in hand a single city,—if then a man seated on an
elevated spot could take in at a glance all the doings of the men there,
consider what folly he would condemn, what tears he would weep, what
laughter he would laugh, with what hatred he would hate; for we commit
such actions as deserve both laughter, and the charge of folly, and
tears, and hatred. One man keeps dogs to catch  <span
id="fr_2374"></span>[2375](#fn_2374.md) brute animals, himself sinking into
brutality; another keeps oxen and asses to transport stones, but
neglects men wasting with hunger; and spends gold without limit to make
men of stone, but neglects real men, who are becoming like stones
through their evil state. Another, collecting with great pains golden
quarries,  <span id="fr_2375"></span>[2376](#fn_2375.md) puts them about
his walls, but when he beholds the naked bellies of the poor, is not
moved.  <span id="fr_2376"></span>[2377](#fn_2376.md) Some again contrive
garments over their very garments, while their brother hath not even
wherewithal to cover his naked body. Again, one hath swallowed up
another in the <span id="page_304">p. 304</span> <span
id="iv.lxxxiv-Page_304"></span> law-courts; another hath spent his money
on women and parasites, another on stage-players and theatrical bands,
 <span id="fr_2377"></span>[2378](#fn_2377.md) another on splendid
edifices, on purchases of fields and houses. Again, one man is counting
interest, another interest of interest; another is putting together
 <span id="fr_2378"></span>[2379](#fn_2378.md) bands full of many deaths,
and doth not enjoy rest even at night, lying awake for others’ harm.
Then, when it is day, they run, one to his unjust gain, another to his
wanton expense, others to public robbery.  <span
id="fr_2379"></span>[2380](#fn_2379.md) And great is the earnestness about
things superfluous and forbidden, but of things necessary no account is
taken; and they who decide questions of law have indeed the name of
jurymen, but are really  <span id="fr_2380"></span>[2381](#fn_2380.md)
thieves and murderers. And if one should enquire into law suits and
wills, he would find there again ten thousand mischiefs, frauds,
robberies, plots, and about these things is all time spent; but for
spiritual things there is no care, and they all inconvenience the
Church, for the sake of seeing only. But this is not what is required;
we need works, and a pure mind.  <span
id="fr_2381"></span>[2382](#fn_2381.md) But if thou spendest all the day in
grasping after riches, and then coming in sayest a few words, thou hast
not only not propitiated God, but hast even angered Him more. Wouldest
thou conciliate thy Lord, exhibit works, make thyself acquainted with
the mass of woes, look upon the naked, the hungry, the wronged; He hath
cut out for thee ten thousand ways of showing love for men. Let us not
then deceive ourselves by living aimlessly and to no purpose, nor
presume, because we now are in health; but bearing in mind, that often
when we have fallen into sickness, and have reached the extreme of
debility, we have been dead with fear and the looking for things to
come, let us expect to fall again into the same state, let us get again
the same fear, and let us become better men; since what is done now
deserves infinite condemnation. For those in the courts of justice are
like lions and dogs; those in the public places like foxes; and those
who lead a life of leisure, even they do not use their leisure as they
ought, spending all their time on theaters and the mischiefs arising
from them. And there is no one to reprove what is being done; but there
are many who envy, and are vexed that they are not in the like
condition,  <span id="fr_2382"></span>[2383](#fn_2382.md) so that these in
their turn are punished, though not actually doing wicked things. For
they “not only do these things, but also have pleasure in them that do
them.” Because what belongs to their will is alike  <span
id="fr_2383"></span>[2384](#fn_2383.md) corrupt; whence it is plain, that
the intention also will be punished. These things I say each day, and I
will not cease to say them. For if any listen, it is gain; but if none
give heed, ye shall then hear these things, when it will avail you
nothing, and ye shall blame yourselves, and we shall be flee from fault.
But may it never come to pass that we should only have this excuse, but
that you may be our boast before the judgment-seat of Christ, that
together we may enjoy the blessings, through the grace and
lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, with whom to the Father and the
Holy Ghost be glory, for ever and ever. Amen.
