<span id="v.xxxi-p3"></span> *“Through faith, he kept the Passover and
the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the first-born should
touch them. By faith they passed through the Red Sea, as by dry land;
which the Egyptians assaying to do, were drowned.*  <span
id="fr_3308"></span>[3309](#fn_3308.md) *By faith, the walls of Jericho
fell down, after they had been compassed about seven days. By faith, the
harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not, when she had
received the spies with peace.”*

<span id="v.xxxi-p5"></span> \[1.\] <span class="c11"><span
id="v.xxxi-p5.1"></span>Paul</span> is wont to establish many things
incidently, and is very full  <span id="fr_3309"></span>[3310](#fn_3309.md)
of thoughts. For such is the grace of The Spirit. He does not comprehend
a few ideas in a multitude of words, but includes great and manifold
thought in brevity of expressions. Observe at least how, in the midst
 <span id="fr_3310"></span>[3311](#fn_3310.md) of exhortation, and when
discoursing about faith, of what a type and mystery he reminds us,
whereof we have the reality. “Through faith” (he says) “he kept the
Passover and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the
first-born should touch them.”

<span id="v.xxxi-p8"></span> But what is “the sprinkling of blood”?
 <span id="fr_3311"></span>[3312](#fn_3311.md) A lamb was slain in every
household, and the blood was smeared on the door-posts, and this was a
means of warding off the Egyptian destruction. If then the blood of a
lamb preserved the Jews unhurt in the midst of the Egyptians, and under
so great a destruction, much more will the blood of Christ save us, who
have had it sprinkled  <span id="fr_3312"></span>[3313](#fn_3312.md) not on
the door-posts, but in our souls. For even now also the Destroyer is
going about in this depth of night: but let us be armed with that
Sacrifice. (He calls the “sprinkling”  <span
id="fr_3313"></span>[3314](#fn_3313) anointing..md) For God has brought us
out from Egypt, from darkness, from idolatry.

<span id="v.xxxi-p12"></span>Although what was done, was nothing, what
was achieved was great. For what was done was blood; but was achieved,
was salvation, and the stopping, and preventing of destruction. The
angel feared the blood; for he knew of what it was a Type; he shuddered,
thinking on the Lord’s death; therefore he did not touch the door-posts.

<span id="v.xxxi-p13"></span>Moses said, Smear, and they smeared, and
were confident. And you, having the Blood of the Lamb Himself, are ye
not confident?

<span id="v.xxxi-p14"></span>\[2.\] “By faith, they passed through the
Red Sea as by dry land.” Again he compares one whole people with
another, lest they should say, we cannot be as the saints.

<span id="v.xxxi-p15"></span>“By faith” (he says) “they passed through
the Red Sea, as by dry land, which the Egyptians assaying to do, were
drowned.” Here he leads them also to a recollection of the sufferings in
Egypt.

<span id="v.xxxi-p16"></span>How, “by faith”? Because they had hoped to
pass through the sea, and therefore they prayed: or rather it was Moses
who prayed. Seest thou that everywhere Faith goes beyond human
reasonings, and weakness and lowliness? Seest thou that at the same time
they both believed, and feared punishment, both in the blood on the
doors, and in the Red Sea?

<span id="v.xxxi-p17"></span> And he made it clear that it was
\[really\] water, through those that fell into it, and were choked; that
it was not a mere appearance: but as in the case of the lions those who
were devoured proved the reality of the facts, and in the case of the
fiery furnace, those who were burnt; so here also thou seest that the
same things become to the one a cause of salvation  <span
id="fr_3314"></span>[3315](#fn_3314.md) and glory, and to the other of
destruction.

<span id="v.xxxi-p19"></span>So great a good is Faith. And when we fall
into perplexity, then are we delivered, even though we come to death
itself, even though our condition be desperate. For what else was left
\[for them\]? They were unarmed, compassed about by the Egyptians and
the sea; and they must either be drowned if they fled, or fall into the
hands of the Egyptians. But nevertheless \[He\] saved them from
impossibilities. That which was spread under the one as land,
overwhelmed the others as sea. In the former case it forgot its nature:
in the latter it even armed itself against them. (Cf. [Wisd. xix.
20](../../../bib/apo/wis019.htm#020) <span id="v.xxxi-p19.1"></span> ..md)

<span id="v.xxxi-p20"></span>\[3.\] “By faith, the walls of Jericho fell
down, after they had been compassed about for seven days.” For assuredly
the sound of trumpets is not able to throw down stones, though one blow
for ten thousand years; but Faith can do all things.

<span id="v.xxxi-p21"></span>Seest thou that in all cases it is not by
natural sequence, nor yet by any law of nature that it was changed, but
all is done contrary to expectation? Accordingly in this case also all
is done contrary to expectation. For inasmuch as he had said again and
again, that we ought to trust to the future hopes, he introduced all
this argument with reason, showing that not now \[only\], but even from
the beginning all the miracles have been accomplished and achieved by
means of it.

<span id="v.xxxi-p22"></span>“By faith, the harlot Rahab perished not
with <span id="page_488">p. 488</span> <span
id="v.xxxi-Page_488"></span> them that believed not, having received the
spies with peace.” It would then be disgraceful, if you should appear
more faithless even than a harlot. Yet she \[merely\] heard what the men
related, and forthwith believed. Whereupon the end also followed; for
when all perished, she alone was preserved. She did not say to herself,
I shall be with my many friends.  <span
id="fr_3315"></span>[3316](#fn_3315.md) She did not say, Can I possibly be
wiser than these judicious men who do not believe,—and shall I believe?
She said no such thing, but believed what had taken place,  <span
id="fr_3316"></span>[3317](#fn_3316.md) which it was likely that they would
suffer.

<span id="v.xxxi-p25"></span>\[4.\] ( [Heb.
11.32](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#032)<span id="v.xxxi-p25.1"></span> .md)
“And what shall I more say? For the time would fail me to tell.” After
this he no longer puts down the names: but having ended with an harlot,
and put them to shame by the quality of the person, he no longer
enlarges on the histories, lest he should be thought tedious. However he
does not set them aside, but runs over them, \[doing\] both very
judiciously, avoiding satiety, and not spoiling the closeness of
arrangement; he was neither altogether silent, nor did he speak so as to
annoy; for he effects both points. For when a man is contending
vehemently \[in argument\], if he persist in contending, he wearies out
the hearer, annoying him when he is already persuaded, and gaining the
reputation of vain ambitiousness. For he ought to accommodate himself to
what is expedient.

<span id="v.xxxi-p26"></span>“And what do I more say” (he says)? “For
the time would fail me to tell of Gideon, and of Barak, and of Samson,
and of Jephthah, of David also and Samuel, and of the prophets.”

<span id="v.xxxi-p27"></span>Some find fault with Paul, because he puts
Barak, and Samson, and Jephthah in these places. What sayest thou? After
having introduced the harlot, shall he not introduce these? For do not
tell me of the rest of their life, but only whether they did not believe
and shine in Faith.

<span id="v.xxxi-p28"></span>“And the prophets,” he says, ( [Heb.
11.33](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#033)<span id="v.xxxi-p28.1"></span> .md)
“who through faith subdued kingdoms.” Thou seest that he does not here
testify to their life as being illustrious; for this was not the point
in question: but the enquiry thus far was about their faith. For tell me
whether they did not accomplish all by faith?

<span id="v.xxxi-p29"></span> “By faith,” he says, “they subdued
kingdoms;” those with Gideon. “Wrought righteousness;” who? The same.
Plainly he means here, kindness.  <span
id="fr_3317"></span>[3318](#fn_3317.md)

<span id="v.xxxi-p31"></span>I think it is of David that he says “they
obtained promises.” But of what sort were these? Those in which He said
that his “seed should sit upon” his “throne.” ( [Ps. cxxxii.
12](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#012) <span id="v.xxxi-p31.1"></span> ..md)

<span id="v.xxxi-p32"></span>“Stopped the mouths of lions,” ( [Heb.
11.34](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#034)<span id="v.xxxi-p32.1"></span> .md)
“quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword.” See how
they were in death itself, Daniel encompassed by the lions, the three
children abiding in the furnace, the Israelites,  <span
id="fr_3318"></span>[3319](#fn_3318.md) Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, in divers
temptations; and yet not even so did they despair. For this is Faith;
when things are turning out adversely, then we ought to believe that
nothing adverse is done, but all things in due order.

<span id="v.xxxi-p34"></span>“Escaped the edge of the sword.” I think
that he is again speaking of the three children.

<span id="v.xxxi-p35"></span> “Out of  <span
id="fr_3319"></span>[3320](#fn_3319.md) weakness were made strong.” Here he
alludes to what took place at their return from Babylon. For “out of
weakness,” is out of captivity. When the condition of the Jews had now
become desperate, when they were no better than dead bones, who could
have expected that they would return from Babylon, and not return only;
but also “wax valiant” and “turn to flight armies of aliens”? ‘But to
us,’ some one says,  <span id="fr_3320"></span>[3321](#fn_3320.md) ‘no such
thing has happened.’ But these are figures of “the things to come.” (
[Heb. 11.35](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#035.md)<span
id="v.xxxi-p37.2"></span> ) “Women received their dead raised to life
again.” He here speaks of what occurred in regard to the prophets,
Elisha, \[and\] Elijah; for they raised the dead.

<span id="v.xxxi-p38"></span>\[5.\] ( [Heb.
11.35](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#035)<span id="v.xxxi-p38.1"></span> .md)
“And others were tortured,  <span id="fr_3321"></span>[3322](#fn_3321.md)
not accepting deliverance, that they might obtain a better
resurrection.” But we have not obtained a Resurrection. I am able
however, he means, to show that they also were cut off, and did “not
accept \[deliverance\], that they might obtain a better resurrection.”
For why, tell me, when it was open to them to live, did they not choose
it? Were they not evidently looking for a better life? And they who had
raised up others, themselves chose to die; in order “to obtain a better
resurrection,” not such as the children of those women.  <span
id="fr_3322"></span>[3323](#fn_3322.md)

<span id="v.xxxi-p41"></span> Here I think he alludes both to John and
to James. For beheading is called “torturing.”  <span
id="fr_3323"></span>[3324](#fn_3323.md) It was in their power still to
behold the sun. It was in their power to abstain from reproving  <span
id="fr_3324"></span>[3325](#fn_3324.md) \[sinners\], and yet they chose to
die; even they who had raised others chose to die themselves, “that they
might obtain a better resurrection.”

<span id="v.xxxi-p44"></span>( [Heb.
11.36](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#036)<span id="v.xxxi-p44.1"></span> .md)
“And others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yea moreover of
bonds and imprisonment.” He ends with these; with things that come
nearer home. For these \[ex <span id="page_489">p. 489</span> <span
id="v.xxxi-Page_489"></span> amples \] especially bring consolation,
when the distress is from the same cause, since even if you mention
something more extreme, yet unless it arise from the same cause, you
have effected nothing. Therefore he concluded his discourse with this,
mentioning “bonds, imprisonments, scourges, stonings,” alluding to the
case of Stephen, also to that of Zacharias.

<span id="v.xxxi-p45"></span>Wherefore he added, “They were slain with
the sword.” What sayest thou? Some “escaped the edge of the sword,” and
some “were slain by the sword.” ( [Heb.
11.34](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#034.md)<span id="v.xxxi-p45.1"></span>
.) What is this? Which dost thou praise? Which dost thou admire? The
latter or the former? Nay, he says: the former indeed, is appropriate to
you, and the latter, because Faith was strong even unto death itself,
and it is a type of things to come. For the wonderful qualities of Faith
are two, that it both accomplishes great things, and suffers great
things, and counts itself to suffer nothing.

<span id="v.xxxi-p46"></span> And thou canst not say (he says) that
these were sinners and worthless. For even if you put the whole world
against them, I find that they weigh down the beam and are of greater
value.  <span id="fr_3325"></span>[3326](#fn_3325.md) What then were they
to receive in this life? Here he raises up their thoughts, teaching them
not to be riveted to things present, but to mind  <span
id="fr_3326"></span>[3327](#fn_3326.md) things greater than all that are in
this present life, since the “world is not worthy” of them. What then
dost thou wish to receive here? For it were an insult to thee, shouldst
thou receive thy reward here.

<span id="v.xxxi-p49"></span> \[6.\] Let us not then mind  <span
id="fr_3327"></span>[3328](#fn_3327.md) worldly things, nor seek our
recompense here, nor be so beggarly. For if “the” whole “world is not
worthy of” them, why dost thou seek after a part of it? And with good
reason; for they are friends of God.

<span id="v.xxxi-p51"></span>Now by “the world” does he mean here the
people, or the creation itself? Both: for the Scripture is wont to use
the word of both. If the whole creation, he would say, with the human
beings that belong to it, were put in the balance, they yet would not be
of equal value with these; and with reason. For as ten thousand measures
of chaff and hay would not be of equal value to ten pearls, so neither
they; for “better is one that doeth the will of the Lord, than ten
thousand transgressors” ( [Ecclesiasticus
16.3](../../../bib/apo/sir016.htm#003)<span id="v.xxxi-p51.1"></span> .md);
 <span id="fr_3328"></span>[3329](#fn_3328.md) meaning by “ten thousand”
not \[merely\] many, but an infinite multitude.

<span id="v.xxxi-p53"></span>Consider of how great value is the
righteous man. Joshua the son of Nun said, “Let the sun stand still at
Gibeon, the moon at the valley of Elom” ( [Josh. x.
12](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#012) <span id="v.xxxi-p53.1"></span> .md),
and it was so. Let then the whole world come, or rather two or three, or
four, or ten, or twenty worlds, and let them say and do this; yet shall
they not be able. But the friend of God commanded the creatures of his
Friend, or rather he besought his Friend, and the servants yielded, and
he below gave command to those above. Seest thou that these things are
for service fulfilling their appointed course?

<span id="v.xxxi-p54"></span>This was greater than the \[miracles\] of
Moses. Why (I ask)? Because it is not a like thing to command the sea
and the heavenly \[bodies\]. For that indeed was also a great thing, yea
very great, nevertheless it was not at all equal \[to the other\].

<span id="v.xxxi-p55"></span> Why was this? The name of Joshua \[ <span
class="c11"><span id="v.xxxi-p55.1"></span>Jesus</span> \],  <span
id="fr_3329"></span>[3330](#fn_3329.md) was a type. For this reason then,
and because of the very name, the creation reverenced him. What then!
Was no other person called Jesus? \[Yes\]; but this man was on this
account so called in type; for he used to be called Hoshea. Therefore
the name was changed: for it was a prediction and a prophecy. He brought
in the people into the promised land, as <span class="c11"><span
id="v.xxxi-p56.9"></span>Jesus</span> \[does\] into heaven; not the Law;
since neither did Moses \[bring them in\], but remained without. The Law
has not power to bring in, but grace. Seest thou the types which have
been before sketched out from the beginning? He laid his commands on the
creation, or rather, on the chief  <span
id="fr_3330"></span>[3331](#fn_3330.md) part of the creation, on the very
head itself as he stood below; that so when thou seest <span
class="c11"><span id="v.xxxi-p57.2"></span>Jesus</span> in the form of
Man saying the same, thou mayest not be disturbed, nor think it strange.
He, even while Moses was living, turned back wars. Thus, even while the
Law is living, He directs  <span id="fr_3331"></span>[3332](#fn_3331.md)
all things; but not openly.

<span id="v.xxxi-p59"></span> \[7.\] But let us consider how great is
the virtue of the saints. If *here* they work such things, if *here*
they do such things, as the angels do, what then above? How great is the
splendor they have?

<span id="v.xxxi-p60"></span> Perhaps each of you might wish to be such
as to be able to command the sun and moon. (At this point what would
they say who assert that the heaven is a sphere?  <span
id="fr_3332"></span>[3333](#fn_3332.md) For why did he not \[merely\] say,
“Let the sun stand still,” but added “Let the sun stand still at the
valley of Elom,” that is, he will make the day longer? This was done
also in the time of Hezekiah. The sun went back. This again is more
wonderful than the other, to go the contrary way, not having yet gone
round his course.)

<span id="v.xxxi-p62"></span>We shall attain to greater things than
these if we will. For what has Christ promised us? Not that we shall
make the sun stand still, or the moon, nor that the sun shall retrace
his steps, but what? “I and the Father will come unto him,” He says,
“and We will make our abode with him.” ( [John xiv.
23](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#023) <span id="v.xxxi-p62.1"></span> ..md)
What need have I <span id="page_490">p. 490</span> <span
id="v.xxxi-Page_490"></span> of the sun and the moon, and of these
wonders, when the Lord of all Himself comes down and abides with me? I
need these not. For what need I any of these things? He Himself shall be
to me for Sun and for Light. For, tell me, if thou hadst entered into a
palace, which wouldst thou choose, to be able to rearrange some of the
things which have been fixed there, or so to make the king a familiar
friend, as to persuade him to take up his abode with thee? Much rather
the latter than the former.

<span id="v.xxxi-p63"></span> \[8.\] But what wonder is it, says some
one, that what a man commands, Christ should also? But Christ (you say)
needs not the Father, but acts of His own authority, you say. Well.
Therefore first confess and say, that he needs not the Father, and acts
of His own authority: and then I will ask thee, whether His prayer is
not in the way of condescension and arrangement (for surely Christ was
not inferior to Joshua the son of Nun), and that He might teach us? For
as when thou hearest a teacher lisping,  <span
id="fr_3333"></span>[3334](#fn_3333.md) and saying over the alphabet, thou
dost not say that he is ignorant; and when he asks, Where is such a
letter? thou knowest that he does not ask in ignorance, but because he
wishes to lead on the scholar; in like manner Christ also did not make
His prayer as needing prayer, but desiring to lead thee on, that thou
mayest continually apply thyself to prayer, that thou mayest do it
without ceasing, soberly, and with great watchfulness.

<span id="v.xxxi-p65"></span> And by watching, I do not mean, merely the
rising at night, but also the being sober  <span
id="fr_3334"></span>[3335](#fn_3334.md) in our prayers during the day. For
such an one is called watchful.  <span
id="fr_3335"></span>[3336](#fn_3335.md) Since it is possible both in
praying by night to be asleep, and in praying by day to be awake, when
the soul is stretched out towards God, when it considers with whom it
holds converse, to whom its words are addressed, when it has in mind
that angels stand by with fear and trembling, while he approaches gaping
and scratching himself.

<span id="v.xxxi-p68"></span>\[9.\] Prayer is a mighty weapon if it be
made with suitable mind. And that thou mayest learn its strength,
continued entreaty has overcome shamelessness, and injustice, and savage
cruelty, and overbearing rashness. For He says, “Hear what the unjust
judge saith.” ( [Luke xviii. 6](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#006.md) <span
id="v.xxxi-p68.1"></span> .) Again it has overcome sloth also, and what
friendship did not effect, this continued entreaty did: and “although he
will not give him because he is his friend” (He says), “yet because of
his importunity he will rise and give to him.” ( [Luke xi.
8](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#008) <span id="v.xxxi-p68.2"></span> .md)
 And continued assiduity made her worthy who was unworthy. “It is not
meet” (He says) “to take the children’s bread and to cast it to the
dogs. Yea! Lord!” she says, “for even the dogs eat \[the crumbs\] from
their master’s table.” ( [Matt. 15:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#026.md),
[27](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#027)<span id="v.xxxi-p68.3"></span> ..md)
Let us apply ourselves to Prayer. It is a mighty weapon if it be offered
with earnestness, if without vainglory, if with a sincere mind. It has
turned back wars, it has benefited an entire nation though undeserving.
“I have heard their groaning” (He says) “and am come down to deliver
them.” ( [Acts vii. 34](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#034.md) <span
id="v.xxxi-p68.4"></span> .) It is itself a saving medicine, and has
power to prevent sins, and to heal misdeeds. In this the desolate widow
was assiduous. ( [1 Tim. v. 5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#005.md) <span
id="v.xxxi-p68.5"></span> .)

<span id="v.xxxi-p69"></span>If then we pray with humility, smiting our
breast as the publican, if we utter what he did, if we say, “Be merciful
to me a sinner” ( [Luke xviii. 13](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#013.md)
<span id="v.xxxi-p69.1"></span> ), we shall obtain all. For though we be
not publicans, yet have we other sins not less than his.

<span id="v.xxxi-p70"></span>For do not tell me, that thou hast gone
wrong in some small matter \[only\], since the thing has the same
nature. For as a man is equally called a homicide whether he has killed
a child or a man, so also is he called overreaching whether he be
overreaching in much or in little. Yea and to remember injuries too, is
no small matter, but even a great sin. For it is said, “the ways of
those who remember injuries \[tend\] to death.” ( [Prov. xii.
28](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#028.md) <span id="v.xxxi-p70.1"></span> ,
LXX.) And “He that is angry with his brother without a cause, shall be
in danger of hell,” and he that “calleth his brother a fool” ( [Matt. v.
22](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#022) <span id="v.xxxi-p70.2"></span> .md),
and senseless, and numberless such things.

<span id="v.xxxi-p71"></span>But we partake even of the tremendous
mysteries unworthily, and we envy, and we revile. And some of us have
even oftentimes been drunk. But each one of these things, even itself by
itself, is enough to cast us out of the kingdom, and when they even come
all together, what comfort shall we have? We need much penitence,
beloved, much prayer, much endurance, much perseverance, that we may be
enabled to attain the good things which have been promised to us.

<span id="v.xxxi-p72"></span>\[10.\] Let us then say, even we, “Be
merciful to me a sinner,” nay rather, let us not say it only, but let us
also be thus minded; and should another call us so, let us not be angry.
He heard the words, “I am not as this Publican” ( [Luke xviii.
11](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#011) <span id="v.xxxi-p72.1"></span> .md),
and was not provoked thereby, but filled with compunction. He accepted
the reproach, and he put away the reproach. The other spoke of the
wound, and he sought the medicine. Let us say then, “Be merciful to me a
sinner” ( [Luke xviii. 13](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#013.md) <span
id="v.xxxi-p72.2"></span> ); but even if another should so call us, let
us not be indignant.

<span id="v.xxxi-p73"></span>But if we say ten thousand evil things of
ourselves, and are vexed when we hear them from others, then there is no
longer humility, nor confession, but ostentation and vainglory. Is it
ostentation (you say) to call one’s self a sinner? Yes; for we obtain
the credit of humility, <span id="page_491">p. 491</span> <span
id="v.xxxi-Page_491"></span> we are admired, we are commended; whereas
if we say the contrary of ourselves, we are despised. So that we do this
too for the sake of credit. But what is humility? It is when another
reviles us, to bear it, to acknowledge our fault, to endure evil
speakings. And yet even this would not be \[a mark\] of humility but of
candor. But now we call ourselves sinners, unworthy, and ten thousand
other such names, but if another apply one of them to us, we are vexed,
we become savage. Seest thou that this is not confession, nor even
candor? Thou saidst of thyself that thou art such an one: be not
indignant if thou hearest it also said by others, and art reproved.

<span id="v.xxxi-p74"></span>In this way thy sins are made lighter for
thee, when others reproach thee: for they lay a burden on themselves
indeed, but thee they lead onwards into philosophy. Hear what the
blessed David says, when Shimei cursed him, “Let him alone” (he says)
“the Lord hath bidden him, that He might look on my humiliation” (he
says): “And the Lord will requite me good for his cursing on this day.”
( [2 Sam. 16:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#011.md),
[12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2016.htm#012)<span id="v.xxxi-p74.1"></span> ..md)

<span id="v.xxxi-p75"></span>But thou while saying evil things of
thyself, even in excess, if thou hearest not from others the
commendations that are due to the most righteous, art enraged. Seest
thou that thou art trifling with things that are no subjects for
trifling? For we even repudiate praises in our desire for other praises,
that we may obtain yet higher panegyrics, that we may be more admired.
So that when we decline to accept commendations, we do it that we may
augment them. And all things are done by us for credit, not for truth.
Therefore all things are hollow, all impracticable. Wherefore I beseech
you now at any rate to withdraw from this mother of evils, vainglory,
and to live according to what is approved by God, that so you may attain
to the good things to come, in Christ Jesus our Lord, with whom to the
Father be glory, together with His Holy and good Spirit, now and ever
and world without end. Amen.
