class="c1"><span id="iv.lxvii-p2.2"></span>[John
11:49](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#049.md),

<span id="iv.lxvii-p3"></span>“And one of them, Caiaphas, being the High
Priest that same year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all, nor
consider that it is expedient that one man should die for the people,
and that the whole nation perish not,” &c.

<span id="iv.lxvii-p4"></span> \[1.\] “ <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.lxvii-p4.1"></span>The</span> heathen are stuck fast in the
destruction which they made; in the trap which they hid is their foot
taken.” ( [Ps. ix. 15](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#015.md) <span
id="iv.lxvii-p4.2"></span> , LXX.) This hath been the case with the
Jews. They said that they would kill Jesus, lest the Romans should come
and take away their place and nation; and when they had killed Him,
these things happened unto them, and when they had done that by doing
which they thought to escape, they yet did not escape. He who was slain
is in Heaven, and they who slew have for their portion hell. Yet they
did not consider these things; but what? “They desired,” It saith, “from
that day forth to kill Him” ( [John
11.53](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#053.md)<span id="iv.lxvii-p4.3"></span>
), for they said, “The Romans will come, and will take away our nation;
and a certain one of them, Caiaphas, being High Priest that year, said,”
(being more shameless than the rest,) “Ye know nothing.” What the others
made matter of doubt, and put forth in the way of deliberation, this man
cried aloud, shamelessly, openly, audaciously. For what saith he? “Ye
know nothing, nor consider that it is expedient that one man should die,
and that the whole nation perish not.”

<span id="iv.lxvii-p5"></span> [John
11.51](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#051.md)<span id="iv.lxvii-p5.1"></span>
. “And this spake he not of himself, but being High Priest he
prophesied.”  <span id="fr_1831"></span>[1832](#fn_1831.md)

<span id="iv.lxvii-p7"></span>Seest thou how great is the force of the
High Priest’s authority? or, since he had in any wise been deemed worthy
of the High Priesthood, although unworthy thereof, he prophesied, not
knowing what he said; and the grace merely made use of his mouth, but
touched not his accursed heart. Indeed many others have foretold things
to come, although unworthy to do so, as Nebuchadnezzar, Pharaoh, Balaam;
and the reason of all is evident. But what he saith is of this kind. 
“Ye still sit quiet, ye give heed but carelessly to this matter, and
know not how to despise one man’s safety for the sake of the community.”
See how great is the power of the Spirit; from an evil imagination It
was able to bring forth words full of marvelous prophecy. The Evangelist
calleth the Gentiles “children of God,” from what was about to be: as
also Christ Himself saith, “Other sheep I have” ( [John
10.16](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#016.md)<span id="iv.lxvii-p7.1"></span>
), so calling them from what should afterwards come to pass.

<span id="iv.lxvii-p8"></span>But what is, “being High Priest that
year”? This matter as well as the rest had become corrupt; for from the
time that offices became matters of purchase, they were no longer
priests for the whole period of their lives, but for a year.
Notwithstanding, even in this state of things the Spirit was still
present. But when they lifted up their hands against Christ, then It
left them, and removed to the Apostles. This the rending of the veil
declared, and the voice of Christ which said, “Behold, your house is
left unto you desolate.” ( [Matt. xxiii.
38](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#038) <span id="iv.lxvii-p8.1"></span> ..md)
And Josephus, who lived a short time after, saith, that certain Angels
who yet remained with them, (to see) if they would alter their ways,
left them.  <span id="fr_1832"></span>[1833](#fn_1832.md) While the
vineyard stood, all things  <span id="fr_1833"></span>[1834](#fn_1833.md)
went on; but when they had slain the Heir, no longer so, but they
perished. And God having taken it from the Jews, as a glorious garment
from an unprofitable son, gave it to right-minded servants of the
Gentiles, leaving the others desolate and naked. It was, moreover, no
small thing that even an enemy should prophesy this. This might draw
over others also. For in respect of his  <span
id="fr_1834"></span>[1835](#fn_1834.md) will, matters fell out
contrariwise, since,  <span id="fr_1835"></span>[1836](#fn_1835.md) when He
died, the faithful were on this account delivered from the punishment to
come. What meaneth, “That He might gather together those near and those
afar off” ( [John 11.52](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#052.md)<span
id="iv.lxvii-p12.3"></span> )? He made them one Body. The dweller in
Rome deemeth the Indians a member of himself. What is equal to this
“gathering together”? And the Head of all is Christ.

<span id="iv.lxvii-p13"></span> [John
11.53](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#053.md)<span id="iv.lxvii-p13.1"></span>
. “From that day forth the Jews  <span
id="fr_1836"></span>[1837](#fn_1836.md) took counsel to put Him to death.”

<span id="iv.lxvii-p15"></span>And, in truth, had sought to do so
before; for the Evangelist saith, “Therefore the Jews sought to kill
Him” ( [John 5.18](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#018.md)<span
id="iv.lxvii-p15.1"></span> ); and, “Why seek ye to kill Me?” ( [John
7.19](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#019.md)<span id="iv.lxvii-p15.2"></span>
.) But then they only sought, now they ratified their determination, and
treated the action as their business.

<span id="iv.lxvii-p16"></span> [John
11.54](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#054.md)<span id="iv.lxvii-p16.1"></span>
. “But Jesus walked no more openly in Jewry.”  <span
id="fr_1837"></span>[1838](#fn_1837.md)

<span id="page_240">p. 240</span> <span id="iv.lxvii-Page_240"></span>

<span id="iv.lxvii-p18"></span> \[2.\] Again He saveth Himself in a
human manner, and this He doth continually. But I have mentioned the
reason for which He often departed and withdrew. And at this time He
dwelt in Ephratah, near the wilderness, and there He tarried with His
disciples. How thinkest thou that those disciples were confounded when
they beheld Him saving Himself after the manner of a man? After this no
man followed Him. For since the Feast was nigh, all were running to
Jerusalem; but they,  <span id="fr_1838"></span>[1839](#fn_1838.md) at a
time when all others were rejoicing and holding solemn assembly, hide
themselves, and are in danger. Yet still they tarried with Him. For they
hid themselves in Galilee, at the time of the Passover and the Feast of
Tabernacles; and after this again during the Feast, they only of all
were with their Master in flight and concealment, manifesting their good
will to Him. Hence Luke recordeth that He said, “I abode with you in
temptations”;  <span id="fr_1839"></span>[1840](#fn_1839.md) and this He
said, showing that they were strengthened by His influence.  <span
id="fr_1840"></span>[1841](#fn_1840.md)

<span id="iv.lxvii-p22"></span> [John
11.55](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#055.md)<span id="iv.lxvii-p22.1"></span>
.  <span id="fr_1841"></span>[1842](#fn_1841.md) “And many went up from the
country to purify themselves.”

<span id="iv.lxvii-p24"></span> [John
11.57](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#057.md)<span id="iv.lxvii-p24.1"></span>
. “And the High Priests and Pharisees had commanded that they should lay
hands on Him.”

<span id="iv.lxvii-p25"></span>A marvelous purification, with a
murderous will, with homicidal intentions, and bloodstained hands!

<span id="iv.lxvii-p26"></span> [John
11.56](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#056.md)<span id="iv.lxvii-p26.1"></span>
. “And they said, Think ye that he will not come to the feast?”

<span id="iv.lxvii-p27"></span> By means of the Passover they plotted
against Him, and made the time of feasting a time of murder, that is, He
there would fall into their hands, because the season summoned Him. What
impiety! When they needed greater carefulness, and to forgive those who
had been taken for the worst offenses, then they attempted to ensnare
One who had done no wrong. Yet by acting thus they had already not only
profited nothing, but become ridiculous. For this end coming among them
continually He escapeth, and restraineth them when they take counsel
 <span id="fr_1842"></span>[1843](#fn_1842.md) to kill Him, and maketh them
to be in perplexity, desiring to prick them by the display of His power;
that when they took Him, they might know that what had been done was
done, not by their power, but by His permission. For not even at that
time could they take Him, and this though Bethany was near; and when
they did take Him, He cast them backwards.

<span id="iv.lxvii-p29"></span> [John
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#001.md),
[2](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#002.md)<span id="iv.lxvii-p29.1"></span> .
“Then six days before the Passover He came to Bethany, where Lazarus
was, and feasted with them; and Martha served, but Lazarus sat at meat.”
 <span id="fr_1843"></span>[1844](#fn_1843.md)

<span id="iv.lxvii-p31"></span> This was a proof of the genuineness of
his resurrection, that after many days he both lived and ate. “And
Martha ministered”; whence it is clear that the meal was in her house,
for they received Jesus as loving and beloved. Some, however, say, that
it took place in the house of another. Mary did not minister, for she
was a disciple. Here again she acted in the more spiritual manner. For
she did not minister as being invited, nor did she afford her services
to all alike. But she directeth  <span
id="fr_1844"></span>[1845](#fn_1844.md) the honor to Him alone, and
approacheth Him not as a man, but as a God. On this account she poured
out the ointment,  <span id="fr_1845"></span>[1846](#fn_1845.md) and wiped
(His feet) with the hairs of her head, which was the action of one who
did not entertain the same opinion concerning Him as did others; yet
Judas rebuked her, under the pretense forsooth of carefulness. What then
saith Christ? “She hath done a good work for My burying.”  <span
id="fr_1846"></span>[1847](#fn_1846.md) But why did He not expose the
disciple in the case of the woman, nor say to him what the Evangelist
hath declared, that on account of his own thieving he rebuked her? In
His abundant longsuffering He wished to bring him to a better mind.
 <span id="fr_1847"></span>[1848](#fn_1847.md) For because He knew that he
was a traitor, He from the beginning often rebuked him, saying, “Not all
believe,” and, “One of you is a devil.” ( [John
6.64](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#064.md)<span id="iv.lxvii-p35.3"></span>
.) He showed them that He knew him to be a traitor, yet He did not
openly rebuke him, but bare with him, desiring to recall him. How then
saith another Evangelist, that all the disciples used these words? (
[Matt. xxvi. 70](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#070.md) <span
id="iv.lxvii-p35.4"></span> .) All used them, and so did he, but the
others not with like purpose. And if any one ask why He put the bag of
the poor in the hands of a thief, and made him steward who was a lover
of money, we would reply, that God knoweth the secret reason; but that,
if we may say something by conjecture, it was that He might cut off from
him all excuse. For he could not say that he did this thing  <span
id="fr_1848"></span>[1849](#fn_1848.md) from love of money, (for he had in
the bag sufficient to allay his desire,) but from excessive wickedness
which Christ wished to restrain, using <span id="page_241">p. 241</span>
<span id="iv.lxvii-Page_241"></span> much condescension towards him.
Wherefore He did not even rebuke him as stealing, although aware of it,
stopping the way to his wicked desire, and taking from him all excuse.
“Let her alone,” He saith, “for against the day of My burying hath she
done  <span id="fr_1849"></span>[1850](#fn_1849.md) this.” Again, He maketh
mention of the traitor in speaking of His burial. But him the reproof
reacheth not, nor doth the expression soften  <span
id="fr_1850"></span>[1851](#fn_1850.md) him, though sufficient to inspire
him with pity: as if He had said, “I am burdensome and troublesome, but
wait a little while, and I shall depart.” This too he intended in
saying,

<span id="iv.lxvii-p39"></span> [John
12.8](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#008.md)<span id="iv.lxvii-p39.1"></span>
. “But Me ye have not always.”  <span
id="fr_1851"></span>[1852](#fn_1851.md)

<span id="iv.lxvii-p41"></span> But none of these things turned back
 <span id="fr_1852"></span>[1853](#fn_1852.md) that savage madman; yet in
truth Jesus said and did far more than this, He washed his feet that
night, made him a sharer in the table and the salt, a thing which is
wont to restrain even the souls of robbers, and spake other words,
enough to melt a stone, and this, not long before, but on the very day,
in order that not even time might cause it to be forgotten. But he stood
out against all.

<span id="iv.lxvii-p43"></span> \[3.\] For a dreadful, a dreadful thing
is the love of money, it disables both eyes and ears, and makes men
worse to deal with than a wild beast, allowing a man to consider neither
conscience, nor friendship, nor fellowship, nor the salvation of his own
soul, but having withdrawn them at once from all these things, like some
harsh mistress,  <span id="fr_1853"></span>[1854](#fn_1853.md) it makes
those captured by it its slaves. And the dreadful part of so bitter a
slavery is, that it persuades them even to be grateful for it; and the
more they become enslaved, the more doth their pleasure increase; and in
this way especially the malady becomes incurable, in this way the
monster becomes hard to conquer. This made Gehazi a leper instead of a
disciple and a prophet; this destroyed Ananias and her with him;  <span
id="fr_1854"></span>[1855](#fn_1854.md) this made Judas a traitor; this
corrupted the rulers of the Jews, who received gifts, and became the
partners of thieves. This hath brought in ten thousand wars, filling the
ways with blood, the cities with wailings and lamentations. This hath
made meals to become impure, and tables accursed, and hath filled food
with transgression; therefore hath Paul called it “idolatry”: ( [Col.
iii. 5](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#005.md) <span
id="iv.lxvii-p45.2"></span> ), and not even so hath he deterred men from
it. And why calleth he it “idolatry”? Many possess wealth, and dare not
use it, but consecrate it, handing it down untouched, not daring to
touch it, as though it were some dedicated thing. And if at any time
they are forced to do so, they feel as though they had done something
unlawful. Besides, as the Greek carefully tends his graven image,  <span
id="fr_1855"></span>[1856](#fn_1855.md) so thou entrusteth thy gold to
doors and bars; providing a chest instead of a shrine, and laying it up
in silver vessels. But thou dost not bow down to it as he to the image?
Yet thou showest all kind of attention to it.

<span id="iv.lxvii-p47"></span>Again, he would rather give up his eyes
or his life than his graven image. So also would those who love gold.
“But,” saith one, “I worship not the gold.” Neither doth he, he saith,
worship the image, but the devil that dwelleth in it; and in like manner
thou, though thou worship not the gold, yet thou worshipest that devil
who springeth on thy soul, from the sight of the gold and thy lust for
it. For more grievous than an evil spirit is the lust of money-loving,
and many obey it more than others do idols. For these last in many
things disobey, but in this case they yield everything, and whatever it
telleth them to do, they obey. What saith it? “Be at war with all,” it
saith, “at enmity with all, know not nature, despise God, sacrifice to
me thyself,” and in all they obey. To the graven images they sacrifice
oxen and sheep, but avarice saith, Sacrifice to me thine own soul, and
the man obeyeth. Seest thou what kind of altars it hath, what kind of
sacrifices it receiveth? The covetous shall not inherit the Kingdom of
God, but not even so do they fear. ( [1 Cor. vi.
10](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#010.md) <span id="iv.lxvii-p47.1"></span>
.) Yet this desire is  <span id="fr_1856"></span>[1857](#fn_1856.md) weaker
than all the others, it is not inborn, nor natural, (for then it would
have been placed in us at the beginning;) but there was no gold at the
beginning, and no man desired gold. But if you will, I will tell you
whence the mischief entered. By each man’s envying the one before him,
men have increased the disease, and he who has gotten in advance
provokes him who had no desire. For when men see splendid houses, and
extensive lands, and troops of slaves, and silver vessels, and great
heaps of apparel, they use every means to outdo them; so that the first
set of men are causes of the second, and these of those who come after.
Now if they would be sober-minded, they would not be teachers (of evil)
to others; yet neither have these any excuse. For others there are also
who despise riches. “And who,” saith one, “despises them?” For the
terrible thing is, that, because wickedness is so general, this seems to
have become impossible, and it is not even believed that one can act
aright. Shall I then mention many both in cities and in the mountains?
And what would it avail? Ye will not from their example become better.
Besides, our discourse hath not now this purpose, that you should empty
yourselves of your substance: I would that ye could do so; however,
since the burden is too <span id="page_242">p. 242</span> <span
id="iv.lxvii-Page_242"></span> heavy for you, I constrain you not; only
I advise you that you desire not what belongs to others, that you impart
somewhat of your own. Many such we shall find, contented with what
belongs to them, taking care of their own, and living on honest labor.
Why do we not rival and imitate these? Let us think of those who have
gone before us. Do not their possessions stand, preserving nothing but
their name; such an one’s bath, such an one’s suburban seat and lodging?
Do we not, when we behold them, straightway groan, when we consider what
toil he endured, what rapine committed? and now he is nowhere seen, but
others luxuriate in his possessions, men whom he never expected would do
so, perhaps even his enemies, while he is suffering extremest
punishment. These things await us also; for we shall certainly die, and
shall certainly have to submit to the same end. How much wrath, tell me,
how much expense, how many enmities these men incurred; and what the
gain? Deathless punishment, and the having no consolation; and the being
not only while alive, but when gone, accused by all? What? when we see
the images of the many laid up in their houses, shall we not weep the
more? Of a truth well said the Prophet, “Verily, every man living
disquieteth himself in vain” ( [Ps. xxxix.
11](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#011.md) <span id="iv.lxvii-p48.2"></span> ,
LXX.); for anxiety about such things is indeed disquiet, disquiet and
superfluous trouble. But it is not so in the everlasting mansions, not
so in those tabernacles. Here one hath labored, and another enjoys; but
there each shall possess his own labors, and shall receive a manifold
reward. Let us press forward to get that possession, there let us
prepare for ourselves houses, that we may rest in Christ Jesus our Lord,
with whom to the Father and the Holy Ghost be glory, for ever and ever.
Amen.
