<span id="iv.xxi-p2"></span> <span id="iv.xxi-p2.1"></span> <span
class="c1"><span id="iv.xxi-p2.2"></span>[John

<span id="iv.xxi-p3"></span>“ He first findeth his own brother Simon,
and saith unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being
interpreted, the Christ. And he brought him to Jesus.”

<span id="iv.xxi-p4"></span> \[1.\] <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.xxi-p4.1"></span>When</span> God in the beginning made man, He
did not suffer him to be alone, but gave him woman for a helpmate, and
made them to dwell together, knowing that great advantage would result
from this companionship. What though the woman did not rightly employ
this benefit? still if any one make himself fully acquainted with the
nature of the matter, he will see, that to the wise great advantage
arises from this dwelling together; not in the cause of wife or husband
only, but if brothers do this, they also shall enjoy the benefit.
Wherefore the Prophet hath said, “What is good, what is pleasant, but
that brethren should dwell together?” ( [Ps. cxxxiii.
1](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#001.md) <span id="iv.xxi-p4.2"></span> ,
LXX.) And Paul exhorted not to neglect the assembling of ourselves
together. ( [Heb. x. 25](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#025.md) <span
id="iv.xxi-p4.3"></span> .) In this it is that we differ from beasts,
for this we have built cities, and markets, and houses, that we may be
united one with another, not in the place of our dwelling only, but by
the bond of love. For since our nature came imperfect  <span
id="fr_492"></span>[493](#fn_492.md) from Him who made it, and is not
self-sufficient,  <span id="fr_493"></span>[494](#fn_493.md) God, for our
advantage, ordained that the want hence existing should be corrected by
the assistance arising from mutual intercourse; so that what was lacking
in one should be supplied by another,  <span
id="fr_494"></span>[495](#fn_494.md) and the defective nature thus be
rendered self-sufficient; as, for instance, that though made mortal,
 <span id="fr_495"></span>[496](#fn_495.md) it should by succession for a
long time maintain immortality. I might have gone into this argument at
greater length, to show what advantages arise to those who come together
from genuine and pure  <span id="fr_496"></span>[497](#fn_496.md)
intercourse with each other: but there is another thing which presses
now, that on account of which we have made these remarks.

<span id="iv.xxi-p10"></span> Andrew, after having tarried with Jesus
and learned what He did, kept not the treasure to himself, but hastens
and runs quickly to his brother, to impart to him of the good things
which he had received.  <span id="fr_497"></span>[498](#fn_497.md) But
wherefore has not John said on what matters Christ conversed with them?
Whence is it clear that it was for this that they “abode with Him”?
 <span id="fr_498"></span>[499](#fn_498.md) It was proved by us the other
day; but we may learn it from what has been read today as well. Observe
what Andrew says to his brother; “We have found the Messias, which is,
being interpreted, the Christ.” You see how, as far as he had learned in
a short time, he showed  <span id="fr_499"></span>[500](#fn_499.md) the
wisdom of the teacher who persuaded them, and their own zeal, who cared
for these things long ago,  <span id="fr_500"></span>[501](#fn_500.md) and
from the beginning. For this word, “we have found,” is the expression of
a soul which travails  <span id="fr_501"></span>[502](#fn_501.md) for His
presence, and looks for His coming from above, and is made overjoyed
when the looked-for thing has happened,  <span
id="fr_502"></span>[503](#fn_502.md) and hastens to impart to others the
good tidings. This is the part of brotherly affection, of natural
friendship, of a sincere disposition, to be eager to stretch out the
hand to each other in spiritual things. Hear him besides speak with the
addition of the article; for he does not say “Messias,” but “the
Messias”; thus they were expecting some one Christ,  <span
id="fr_503"></span>[504](#fn_503.md) having nothing in common with the
others. And behold, I beg of you, the mind of Peter obedient and
tractable from the very beginning; he ran to Him without any delay; “He
brought him,” saith St. John, “to Jesus.” Yet let no one blame his easy
temper if he received the word without much questioning, because it is
probable that his brother had told him these things more exactly and at
length; but the Evangelists from their care for conciseness constantly
cut many things short. Besides, it is not said absolutely that “he
believed,” but that “he brought him to Jesus,” to give him up for the
future to Him, so that from Him he might learn all; for the other
disciple also was with him, and contributed to this. And if John the
Baptist, when he had said that He was “the Lamb,” and that He “baptized
with the Spirit,” gave them over to learn the clearer doctrine
concerning this thing from Him, much more would Andrew have done this,
not deeming him self sufficient to declare the whole, but drawing him to
the very fount of light with so much zeal and joy, that the other  <span
id="fr_504"></span>[505](#fn_504.md) neither deferred nor delayed at all.
 <span id="fr_505"></span>[506](#fn_505.md)

<span id="iv.xxi-p20"></span> [John
1.42](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#042.md)<span id="iv.xxi-p20.1"></span> .
“And when Jesus beheld him,” saith <span id="page_67">p. 67</span> <span
id="iv.xxi-Page_67"></span> the Evangelist, “He said, Thou art Simon,
the son of Jonas; thou shalt be called Cephas, which is, by
interpretation, a stone.”

<span id="iv.xxi-p21"></span>\[2.\] He begins from this time forth to
reveal the things belonging to His Divinity, and to open It out little
by little by predictions. So He did in the case of Nathaniel and the
Samaritan woman. For prophecies bring men over not less than miracles;
and are free from the appearance of boasting. Miracles may possibly be
slandered among foolish men, (“He casteth out devils,” said they, “by
Beelzebub”— [Matt. xii. 24](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#024.md) <span
id="iv.xxi-p21.1"></span> ), but nothing of the kind has ever been said
of prophecy. Now in the case of Nathaniel and Simon He used this method
of teaching, but with Andrew and Philip He did not so. Why was this?
Because those  <span id="fr_506"></span>[507](#fn_506) (two.md) had the
testimony of John, no small preparation, and Philip received a credible
evidence of faith, when he saw those who had been present.

<span id="iv.xxi-p23"></span> “Thou art Simon, the son of Jonas.” By the
present, the future is guaranteed; for it is clear that He who named
Peter’s father foreknew the future also. And the prediction is attended
with praise; but the object was not to flatter, but to foretell
something future. Hear  <span id="fr_507"></span>[508](#fn_507.md) at least
in the case of the Samaritan woman, how He utters a prediction with
severe reproofs;  <span id="fr_508"></span>[509](#fn_508.md) “Thou hast
had,” he saith, “five husbands, and he whom thou now hast is not thy
husband.” ( [John 4.18](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#018.md)<span
id="iv.xxi-p25.1"></span> .) So also His Father makes great account of
prophecy, when He sets Himself against the honor paid to idols: “Let
them declare to you,” saith He, “what shall come upon you” ( [Isa.
xlvii. 13](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#013.md) <span
id="iv.xxi-p25.2"></span> ); and again, “I have declared, and have
saved, and there was no foreign God amongst you” ( [Isa. xliii.
12](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#012.md) <span id="iv.xxi-p25.3"></span> ,
LXX.); and He brings this forward through all prophecy. Because prophecy
is especially the work of God, which devils cannot even imitate, though
they strive exceedingly. For in the case of miracles there may be
delusion; but exactly to foretell the future belongs to that pure Nature
alone. Or if devils ever have done so, it was by deceiving the simpler
sort; whence their oracles are always easily detected.

<span id="iv.xxi-p26"></span> But Peter makes no reply to these words;
as yet he knew nothing clearly, but still was learning. And observe,
that not even the prediction is fully set forth; for Jesus did not say,
“I will change thy name to Peter, and upon this rock I will build My
Church,” but, “Thou shalt be called Cephas.” The former speech would
have expressed too great authority  <span
id="fr_509"></span>[510](#fn_509.md) and power; for Christ does not
immediately nor at first declare all His power, but speaks for a while
in a humbler tone; and so, when He had given the proof of His Divinity,
He puts it more authoritatively, saying,  <span
id="fr_510"></span>[511](#fn_510.md) “Blessed art thou, Simon, because My
Father hath revealed it to thee”; and again, “Thou art Peter, and upon
this rock I will build My Church.” ( [Matt.
16:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#017.md),
[18](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#018)<span id="iv.xxi-p28.1"></span> ..md)
Him therefore He so named, and James and his brother He called “sons of
thunder.” ( [Mark iii. 17](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#017.md) <span
id="iv.xxi-p28.2"></span> .) Why then doth He this? To show that it was
He who gave the old covenant, that it was He who altered names, who
called Abram “Abraham,” and Sarai “Sarah,” and Jacob “Israel.” To many
he assigned names even from their birth, as to Isaac, and Samson, and to
those in Isaiah and Hosea ( [Isa. 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#003.md),
[Hos. 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#004.md),
[6](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#006.md),
[9](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#009)<span id="iv.xxi-p28.3"></span> .md);
but to others He gave them after they had been named by their parents,
as to those we have mentioned, and to Joshua the son of Nun. It was also
a custom of the Ancients to give names from things, which in fact Leah
also has done;  <span id="fr_511"></span>[512](#fn_511.md) and this takes
place not without cause, but in order that men may have the appellation
to remind them of the goodness of God, that a perpetual memory of the
prophecy conveyed by the names may sound in the ears of those who
receive it. Thus too He named John early,  <span
id="fr_512"></span>[513](#fn_512.md) because they whose virtue was to shine
forth from their early youth, from that time received their names; while
to those who were to become great  <span
id="fr_513"></span>[514](#fn_513.md) at a later period, the title also was
given later.

<span id="iv.xxi-p32"></span> \[3.\] But then they received each a
different name, we now have all one name, that which is greater than
any, being called  <span id="fr_514"></span>[515](#fn_514.md) “Christians,”
and “sons of God,” and (His) “friends,” and (His) “Body.” For the very
term itself is able more than all those others to rouse us, and make us
more zealous  <span id="fr_515"></span>[516](#fn_515.md) for the practice
of virtue. Let us not then act unworthily of the honor belonging to the
title, considering  <span id="fr_516"></span>[517](#fn_516.md) the excess
of our dignity, we who are called Christ’s; for so Paul hath named us.
Let us bear in mind and respect the grandeur of the appellation. ( [1
Cor. iii. 23](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#023.md) <span
id="iv.xxi-p35.1"></span> .) For if one who is said to be descended from
some famous general, or one otherwise distinguished, is proud to be
called this or that man’s son, and deems the name a great honor, and
strives in every way so as not to affix, by remissness of his own,
reproach to him after whom he is called; shall not we who are called
after the name, not of a general, nor any of the princes upon earth, nor
Angel, nor Archangel, nor Seraphim, but of the King of these Himself,
shall <span id="page_68">p. 68</span> <span id="iv.xxi-Page_68"></span>
not we freely give even our very life, so as not to insult Him who has
honored us? Know ye not what honor the royal bands of shield-bearers and
spearmen that are about the king enjoy? So let us who have been deemed
worthy to be near Him, and much closer, and as much nearer than those
just named, as the body is closer to the head than they, let us, I say,
use every means to be imitators of Christ.

<span id="iv.xxi-p36"></span>What then saith Christ? “The foxes have
holes, and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not
where to lay His head.” ( [Luke ix. 58](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#058.md)
<span id="iv.xxi-p36.1"></span> .) Now if I demand this of you, it will
seem perhaps to most of you grievous and burdensome; because therefore
of your infirmity I speak not of  <span
id="fr_517"></span>[518](#fn_517.md) such perfection, but desire you not to
be nailed to riches; and as I, because of the infirmity of the many,
retire somewhat from (demanding) the excess of virtue, I desire that you
do so and much more on the side of vice. I blame not those who have
houses, and lands, and wealth, and servants, but wish them to possess
 <span id="fr_518"></span>[519](#fn_518.md) these things in a safe and
becoming way. And what is “a becoming way”? As masters, not as slaves;
so that they rule them, be not ruled by them; that they use, not abuse
them. This is why they are called, “things to be used,”  <span
id="fr_519"></span>[520](#fn_519.md) that we may employ them on necessary
services, not hoard them up; this is a domestic’s office, that a
master’s; it is for the slave to keep them, but for the lord and one who
has great authority to expend. Thou didst not receive thy wealth to
bury, but to distribute. Had God desired riches to be hoarded, He would
not have given them to men, but would have let them remain as they were
in the earth; but because He wishes them to be spent, therefore He has
permitted us to have them, that we may impart them to each other. And if
we keep them to ourselves, we are no longer masters of them. But if you
wish to make them greater and therefore keep them shut up, even in this
case the best plan of all is to scatter and distribute them in all
directions; because there can be no revenue without an outlay, no wealth
without expenditure. One may see that it is so even in worldly matters.
So it is with the merchant, so with the husbandman, who put forth the
one his wealth, the other his seed; the one sails the sea to disperse
his wares, the other labors all the year putting in and tending his
seed. But here there is no need of any one of these things, neither to
equip a vessel, nor to yoke oxen, nor to plough land, nor to be anxious
about uncertain weather, nor to dread a fall of hail; here are neither
waves nor rocks; this voyage and this sowing needs one thing only, that
we cast forth our possessions; all the rest will that Husbandman do, of
whom Christ saith, “My Father is the Husbandman.” ( [John
15.1](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#001)<span id="iv.xxi-p39.2"></span> ..md)
Is it not then absurd to be sluggish and slothful where we may gain all
without labor, and where there are many toils and many  <span
id="fr_520"></span>[521](#fn_520.md) troubles and cares, and after all, an
uncertain hope, there to display all eagerness? Let us not, I beseech
you, let us not be to such a degree senseless about our own salvation,
but let us leave the more troublesome task, and run to that which is
most easy and more profitable, that we may obtain also the good things
that are to come; through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus
Christ, with whom to the Father and the Holy and quickening Spirit be
glory, now and ever, and world without end.  Amen.
