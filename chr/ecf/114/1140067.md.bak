<span id="iv.lxiv-p3"></span> *“Now a certain man was sick, named
Lazarus, of Bethany, of the town of Mary and her sister Martha. It was
that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment.”*  <span
id="fr_1663"></span>[1664](#fn_1663.md)

<span id="iv.lxiv-p5"></span> \[1.\] <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.lxiv-p5.1"></span>Many</span> men, when they see any of those who
are pleasing to God suffering anything terrible, as, for instance,
having fallen into sickness, or poverty, and any other the like, are
offended, not knowing that to those especially dear to God it belongeth
to endure these things; since Lazarus also was one of the friends of
Christ, and was sick. This at least they who sent said, “Behold, he whom
Thou lovest is sick.” But let us consider the passage from the
beginning. “A certain man,” It saith, “was sick, Lazarus of Bethany.”
Not without a cause nor by chance hath the writer mentioned whence
Lazarus was, but for a reason which he will afterwards tell us. At
present let us keep to the passage before us. He also for our advantage
informeth us who were Lazarus’ sisters; and, moreover, what Mary had
more (than the other), going on to say, “It was that Mary which anointed
the Lord with ointment.”  Here some doubting  <span
id="fr_1664"></span>[1665](#fn_1664.md) say, “How did the Lord endure that
a woman should do this?” In the first place then it is necessary to
understand, that this is not the harlot mentioned in Matthew ( [Matt.
xxvi. 7](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#007.md) <span
id="iv.lxiv-p6.3"></span> ), or the one in Luke ( [Luke vii.
37](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#037) <span id="iv.lxiv-p6.4"></span> .md),
but a different person; they were harlots full of many vices, but she
was both grave and earnest; for she showed her earnestness about the
entertainment of Christ. The Evangelist also means to show, that the
sisters too loved Him, yet He allowed Lazarus to die. But why did they
not, like the centurion and the nobleman, leave their sick brother, and
come to Christ, instead of sending? They were very confident in Christ,
and had towards Him a strong familiar feeling. Besides, they were weak
women, and oppressed with grief; for that they acted not in this way as
thinking slightly of Him, they afterwards showed. It is then clear, that
this Mary was not the harlot. “But wherefore,” saith some one, “did
Christ admit that harlot?” That He might put away her iniquity; that He
might show His lovingkindness; that thou mightest learn that there is no
malady which prevaileth over His goodness. Look not therefore at this
only, that He received her, but consider the other point also, how He
changed her. But, (to return,) why doth the Evangelist relate this
history to us? Or rather, what doth he desire to show us by saying,

<span id="iv.lxiv-p7"></span> [John
11.5](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#005.md)<span id="iv.lxiv-p7.1"></span> .
 <span id="fr_1665"></span>[1666](#fn_1665.md) “Jesus loved Martha, and her
sister, and Lazarus.”

<span id="iv.lxiv-p9"></span>That we should never be discontented or
vexed if any sickness happen to good men, and such as are dear to God.

<span id="iv.lxiv-p10"></span> [John
11.3](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#003.md)<span id="iv.lxiv-p10.1"></span> .
 <span id="fr_1666"></span>[1667](#fn_1666.md) “Behold, he whom thou lovest
is sick.”

<span id="iv.lxiv-p12"></span> They desired to draw on Christ to pity,
for they still gave heed to Him as to a man. This is plain from what
they say, “If thou hadst been here, he  <span
id="fr_1667"></span>[1668](#fn_1667.md) had not died,” and from their
saying, not, “Behold, Lazarus is sick,” but “Behold, he whom thou lovest
is sick.” What then said Christ?

<span id="iv.lxiv-p14"></span> [John
11.4](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#004.md)<span id="iv.lxiv-p14.1"></span> .
“This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son
of God might be glorified thereby.”

<span id="iv.lxiv-p15"></span>Observe how He again asserteth that His
glory and the Father’s is One; for after saying “of God,” He hath added,
“that the Son of God might be glorified.”

<span id="iv.lxiv-p16"></span> “This sickness is not unto death.” Since
He intended to tarry two days where He was, He for the present sendeth
away the messengers with this answer. Wherefore we must admire Lazarus’
sisters, that after hearing that the sickness was “not unto death,” and
yet seeing him dead, they were not offended, although the event had been
directly contrary. But even so they came to Him,  <span
id="fr_1668"></span>[1669](#fn_1668.md) and did not think that He had
spoken falsely.

<span id="iv.lxiv-p18"></span>The expression “that” in this passage
denotes not cause, but consequence; the sickness happened from other
causes, but He used it for the glory of God.

<span id="iv.lxiv-p19"></span> [John
11.6](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#006.md)<span id="iv.lxiv-p19.1"></span> .
“And having said this, He tarried two days.”  <span
id="fr_1669"></span>[1670](#fn_1669.md)

<span id="iv.lxiv-p21"></span> Wherefore tarried He? That Lazarus might
breathe his last, and be buried; that none might be able to assert that
He restored him when not yet dead, saying that it was a lethargy, a
fainting, a fit,  <span id="fr_1670"></span>[1671](#fn_1670.md) but not
death. On this account He tarried so long, that corruption began, and
they said, “He now stinketh.”

<span id="iv.lxiv-p23"></span> [John
11.7](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#007.md)<span id="iv.lxiv-p23.1"></span> .
“Then saith He to his disciples, Let us go into Judea.”  <span
id="fr_1671"></span>[1672](#fn_1671.md)

<span id="iv.lxiv-p25"></span> <span id="page_226">p. 226</span> <span
id="iv.lxiv-Page_226"></span> Why, when He never in other places told
them beforehand where He was going, doth He tell them here? They had
been greatly terrified, and since they were in this way disposed, He
forewarneth them, that the suddenness might not trouble them. What then
say the disciples?

<span id="iv.lxiv-p26"></span> [John
11.8](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#008.md)<span id="iv.lxiv-p26.1"></span> .
“The Jews of late sought to stone Thee, and goest Thou thither again?”

<span id="iv.lxiv-p27"></span>They therefore had feared for Him also,
but for the more part rather for themselves; for they were not yet
perfect. So Thomas, shaking with fear, said, “Let us go, that we also
may die with Him” ( [John 11.16](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#016.md)<span
id="iv.lxiv-p27.1"></span> ), because Thomas was weaker and more
unbelieving  <span id="fr_1672"></span>[1673](#fn_1672.md) than the rest.
But see how Jesus encourageth them by what He saith.

<span id="iv.lxiv-p29"></span> [John
11.9](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#009.md)<span id="iv.lxiv-p29.1"></span> .
“Are there not twelve hours of the day?”  <span
id="fr_1673"></span>[1674](#fn_1673.md)

<span id="iv.lxiv-p31"></span> He either saith this,  <span
id="fr_1674"></span>[1675](#fn_1674.md) that “he who is conscious to
himself of no evil, shall suffer nothing dreadful; only he that doeth
evil shall suffer, so that we need not fear, because we have done
nothing worthy of death”; or else that, “he who ‘seeth the light of this
world’ is  <span id="fr_1675"></span>[1676](#fn_1675.md) in safety; and if
he that seeth the light of this world is in safety, much more he that is
with Me, if he separate not himself from Me.” Having encouraged them by
these words, He addeth, that the cause of their going thither was
pressing, and showeth them that they were about to go not unto
Jerusalem, but unto Bethany.

<span id="iv.lxiv-p34"></span> [John
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#011.md),
[12](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#012.md)<span id="iv.lxiv-p34.1"></span> .
“Our friend Lazarus,” He saith, “sleepeth, but I go that I may awake him
out of sleep.”

<span id="iv.lxiv-p35"></span>That is, “I go not for the same purpose as
before, again to reason and contend with the Jews, but to awaken our
friend.”

<span id="iv.lxiv-p36"></span> [John
11.12](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#012.md)<span id="iv.lxiv-p36.1"></span>
. “Then said His disciples, Lord, if he sleep he shall do well.”

<span id="iv.lxiv-p37"></span>This they said not without a cause, but
desiring to hinder the going thither. “Sayest Thou,” asks one of them,
“that he sleepeth? Then there is no urgent reason for going.” Yet on
this account He had said, “Our friend,” to show that the going there was
necessary. When therefore their disposition was somewhat reluctant, He
said,

<span id="iv.lxiv-p38"></span>\[2.\] [John
11.14](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#014.md)<span id="iv.lxiv-p38.1"></span>
.  <span id="fr_1676"></span>[1677](#fn_1676.md) “He is dead.”

<span id="iv.lxiv-p40"></span>The former word He spake, desiring to
prove that He loved not boasting; but since they understood not, He
added, “He is dead.”

<span id="iv.lxiv-p41"></span> [John
11.15](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#015.md)<span id="iv.lxiv-p41.1"></span>
. “And I am glad for your sakes.”

<span id="iv.lxiv-p42"></span>Why “for your sakes”? “Because I have
forewarned you of his death, not being there, and because when I shall
raise him again, there will be no suspicion of deceit.” Seest thou how
the disciples were yet imperfect in their disposition, and knew not His
power as they ought? and this was caused by interposing terrors, which
troubled and disturbed their souls. When He said, “He sleepeth,” He
added, “I go to awake him”; but when He said, “He is dead,” He added
not, “I go to raise him”; for He would not foretell in words what He was
about to establish certainly by works, everywhere teaching us not to be
vainglorious, and that we must not make promises without a cause. And if
He did thus in the case of the centurion when summoned, (for He said, “I
will come and heal him [Matt. viii. 7](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#007.md)
<span id="iv.lxiv-p42.1"></span> ,) it was to show the faith of the
centurion that He said this. If any one ask, “How did the disciples
imagine sleep? How did they not understand that death was meant from His
saying, ‘I go to awake him?’ for it was folly if they expected that He
would go fifteen stadia to awake him”; we would reply, that they deemed
this to be a dark saying, such as He often spake to them.

<span id="iv.lxiv-p43"></span>Now they all feared the attacks of the
Jews, but Thomas above the rest; wherefore also he said,

<span id="iv.lxiv-p44"></span> [John
11.16](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#016.md)<span id="iv.lxiv-p44.1"></span>
. “Let us go, that we also may die with Him.”

<span id="iv.lxiv-p45"></span> Some say that he desired himself to die;
but it is not so; the expression is rather one of cowardice. Yet he was
not rebuked, for Christ as yet supported his weakness, but afterwards he
became stronger than all, and invincible.  <span
id="fr_1677"></span>[1678](#fn_1677.md) For the wonderful thing is this;
that we see one who was so weak before the Crucifixion, become after the
Crucifixion, and after having believed in the Resurrection, more zealous
than any. So great was the power of Christ. The very man who dared not
go in company with Christ to Bethany, the same while not seeing Christ
ran  <span id="fr_1678"></span>[1679](#fn_1678.md) well nigh through the
inhabited world, and dwelt in the midst of nations that were full of
murder, and desirous to kill him.

<span id="iv.lxiv-p48"></span> But if Bethany was “fifteen furlongs
off,” which is two miles, how was Lazarus “dead four days”?  <span
id="fr_1679"></span>[1680](#fn_1679.md) Jesus tarried two days, on the day
before those two one had come with the message,  <span
id="fr_1680"></span>[1681](#fn_1680) (on which same day Lazarus died,.md)
then in the course of the fourth day He arrived. He waited to be
summoned, and came not uninvited on this account, that no one might
suspect what took place; nor did those women who were beloved by Him
come themselves, but others were sent.

<span id="iv.lxiv-p51"></span> <span id="page_227">p. 227</span> <span
id="iv.lxiv-Page_227"></span>[John
11.18](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#018.md)<span id="iv.lxiv-p51.1"></span>
. “Now Bethany was  <span id="fr_1681"></span>[1682](#fn_1681.md) about
fifteen furlongs off.”

<span id="iv.lxiv-p53"></span>Not without cause doth he mention this,
but desires to inform us that it was near, and that it was probable on
this account that many would be there. He therefore declaring this adds,

<span id="iv.lxiv-p54"></span> [John
11.19](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#019.md)<span id="iv.lxiv-p54.1"></span>
. “Many of the Jews came  <span id="fr_1682"></span>[1683](#fn_1682.md) to
comfort them.”  <span id="fr_1683"></span>[1684](#fn_1683.md)

<span id="iv.lxiv-p57"></span> But how should they comfort women beloved
of Christ, when  <span id="fr_1684"></span>[1685](#fn_1684.md) they had
agreed, that if any should confess Christ, he should be put out of the
synagogue? It was either because of the grievous nature of the calamity,
or that they respected them as of superior birth, or else these who came
were not the wicked sort, many at least even of them believed. The
Evangelist mentions these circumstances, to prove that Lazarus was
really dead.

<span id="iv.lxiv-p59"></span> \[3.\] But why did not \[Martha,\] when
she went to meet Christ,  <span id="fr_1685"></span>[1686](#fn_1685.md)
take her sister with her? She desired to meet with Him apart, and to
tell Him what had taken place. But when He had brought her to good
hopes, she went and called Mary, who met Him while her grief was yet at
its height. Seest thou how fervent her love was? This is the Mary of
whom He said, “Mary hath chosen that good part.” ( [Luke x.
42](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#042) <span id="iv.lxiv-p60.5"></span> ..md)
“How then,” saith one, “doth Martha appear more zealous?” She was not
more zealous, but it was because the other had not yet been informed,
 <span id="fr_1686"></span>[1687](#fn_1686.md) since Martha was the weaker.
For even when she had heard such things from Christ, she yet speaks in a
groveling manner, “By this time he stinketh, for he hath been dead four
days.” ( [John 11.39](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#039.md)<span
id="iv.lxiv-p61.3"></span> .) But Mary, though she had heard nothing,
uttered nothing of the kind, but at once believing,  <span
id="fr_1687"></span>[1688](#fn_1687.md) saith,  <span
id="fr_1688"></span>[1689](#fn_1688.md)

<span id="iv.lxiv-p64"></span> [John
11.21](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#021.md)<span id="iv.lxiv-p64.1"></span>
. “Lord, if Thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.”

<span id="iv.lxiv-p65"></span> See how great is the heavenly wisdom of
the women, although their understanding be weak. For when they saw
Christ, they did not break out into mourning and wailing and loud
crying, as we do when we see any of those we know coming in upon our
grief; but straightway they reverence their Teacher. So then both these
sisters believed in Christ, but not in a right way; for they did not yet
certainly know  <span id="fr_1689"></span>[1690](#fn_1689.md) either that
He was God, or that He did these things by His own power and authority;
on both which points He taught them. For they showed their ignorance of
the former, by saying, “If thou hadst been here, our brother had not
died”; and of the latter, by saying,  <span
id="fr_1690"></span>[1691](#fn_1690.md)

<span id="iv.lxiv-p68"></span> [John
11.22](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#022.md)<span id="iv.lxiv-p68.1"></span>
. “Whatsoever  <span id="fr_1691"></span>[1692](#fn_1691.md) thou wilt ask
of God, He will give it thee.”

<span id="iv.lxiv-p70"></span>As though they spoke of some virtuous and
approved mortal. But see what Christ saith;

<span id="iv.lxiv-p71"></span> [John
11.23](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#023.md)<span id="iv.lxiv-p71.1"></span>
. “Thy brother shall rise again.”

<span id="iv.lxiv-p72"></span> He thus far refuteth the former saying,
“Whatsoever thou wilt ask”; for He said not, “I ask,” but what? “Thy
brother shall rise again.” To have said, “Woman, thou still lookest
below, I need not the help of another, but do all of Myself,” would have
been grievous, and a stumblingblock in her way, but to say, “He shall
rise again,” was the act of one who chose a middle mode of speech.
 <span id="fr_1692"></span>[1693](#fn_1692.md) And by means of that which
follows, He alluded to the points I have mentioned; for when Martha
saith,

<span id="iv.lxiv-p74"></span> [John
11.24](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#024.md)<span id="iv.lxiv-p74.1"></span>
. “I know that he shall rise again  <span
id="fr_1693"></span>[1694](#fn_1693.md) in the last day,” to prove more
clearly His authority, He replieth,

<span id="iv.lxiv-p76"></span> [John
11.25](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#025.md)<span id="iv.lxiv-p76.1"></span>
. “I am the Resurrection and the Life.”

<span id="iv.lxiv-p77"></span> Showing that He needed no other to help
Him, if so be that He Himself is the Life; since if He needed another,
 <span id="fr_1694"></span>[1695](#fn_1694.md) how could He be “the
Resurrection and the Life”? Yet He did not plainly state this, but
merely hinted it. But when she saith again, “Whatsoever thou wilt ask,”
He replieth,

<span id="iv.lxiv-p79"></span>“He that believeth in Me, though he were
dead, yet shall he live.”

<span id="iv.lxiv-p80"></span>Showing that He is the Giver of good
things, and that we must ask of Him.

<span id="iv.lxiv-p81"></span> [John
11.26](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#026.md)<span id="iv.lxiv-p81.1"></span>
. “And whosoever liveth and believeth in Me, shall never die.”

<span id="iv.lxiv-p82"></span>Observe how He leadeth her mind upward;
for to raise Lazarus was not the only thing sought; it was necessary
that both she and they who were with her should learn the Resurrection.
Wherefore before the raising of the dead He teacheth heavenly wisdom by
words. But if He is “the Resurrection,” and “the Life,” He is not
confined by place, but, present everywhere, knoweth how to heal.  If
therefore they had said, as did the centurion, “Speak the word, and my
servant shall be healed” ( [Matt. viii.
8](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#008) <span id="iv.lxiv-p82.1"></span> .md),
He would have done so; but since they summoned Him to them, and begged
Him to come, He condescendeth in order to raise them from the humble
opinion they had formed of Him, and cometh to the place. Still while
condescending, He showed that even when absent He had power to heal. On
this account also He delayed, for the mercy would not have been appar
<span id="page_228">p. 228</span> <span id="iv.lxiv-Page_228"></span>
ent as soon as it was given, had there not been first an ill savor (from
the corpse). But how did the woman know that there was to be a
Resurrection? They  <span id="fr_1695"></span>[1696](#fn_1695.md) had heard
Christ say many things about the Resurrection, yet still she now desired
to see Him. And observe how she still lingers below; for after hearing,
“I am the Resurrection and the Life,” not even so did she say, “Raise
him,” but,

<span id="iv.lxiv-p84"></span> [John
11.27](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#027.md)<span id="iv.lxiv-p84.1"></span>
. “I believe that Thou art the Christ, the Son of God.”

<span id="iv.lxiv-p85"></span> What is Christ’s reply? “He that
believeth on Me, though he were dead, yet shall he live,”  <span
id="fr_1696"></span>[1697](#fn_1696.md) (here speaking of this death which
is common to all.  <span id="fr_1697"></span>[1698](#fn_1697) .md) “And
whosoever liveth and believeth on Me, shall never die” ( [John
11.26](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#026.md)<span id="iv.lxiv-p87.3"></span>
), signifying that other death. “Since then I am the Resurrection and
the Life, be not thou troubled, though thy brother be already dead, but
believe, for this is not death.” For a while He comforted her on what
had happened; and gave her glimpses of hope, by saying, “He shall rise
again,” and, “I am the Resurrection”; and that having risen  <span
id="fr_1698"></span>[1699](#fn_1698.md) again, though he should again die,
he shall suffer no harm, so that it needs not to fear this death. What
He saith is of this kind: “Neither is this man dead, nor shall ye die.”
“Believest thou this?” She saith, “I believe that Thou art the Christ,
the Son of God.”

<span id="iv.lxiv-p89"></span>“Which should come into the world.”

<span id="iv.lxiv-p90"></span>The woman seems to me not to understand
the saying; she was conscious that it was some great thing, but did not
perceive the whole meaning, so that when asked one thing, she answered
another. Yet for a while at least she had this gain, that she moderated
her grief; such was the power of the words of Christ. On this account
Martha went forth first, and Mary followed. For their affection to their
Teacher did not allow them strongly to feel their present sorrow; so
that the minds of these women were truly wise as well as loving.

<span id="iv.lxiv-p91"></span> \[4.\] But in our days, among our other
evils there is one malady very prevalent among our women; they make a
great show in their dirges and wailings, baring  <span
id="fr_1699"></span>[1700](#fn_1699.md) their arms, tearing their hair,
making furrows down their cheeks. And this they do, some from grief,
others from ostentation and rivalry, others from wantonness; and they
bare their arms, and this too in the sight of men. Why doest thou,
woman? Dost thou strip thyself in unseemly sort, tell me, thou who art a
member of Christ, in the midst of the market-place, when men are present
there? Dost thou pluck thy hair, and rend thy garments, and wail loudly,
 <span id="fr_1700"></span>[1701](#fn_1700.md) and join the dance, and keep
throughout a resemblance to Bacchanalian women, and dost thou not think
that thou art offending God? What madness is this? Will not the heathen
 <span id="fr_1701"></span>[1702](#fn_1701.md) laugh? Will they not deem
our doctrines fables? They will say, “There is no resurrection—the
doctrines of the Christians are mockeries, trickery, and contrivance.
For their women lament as though there were nothing after this world;
they give no heed to the words engraven in their books; all those words
are fictions, and these women show that they are so. Since had they
believed that he who hath died is not dead, but hath removed to a better
life, they would not have mourned him as no longer being, they would not
have thus beaten themselves,  <span id="fr_1702"></span>[1703](#fn_1702.md)
they would not have uttered such words as these, full of unbelief, ‘I
shall never see thee more, I shall never more regain thee,’ all their
religion is a fable, and if the very chief of good things is thus wholly
disbelieved by them, much more the other things which are reverenced
among them.” The heathen  <span id="fr_1703"></span>[1704](#fn_1703.md) are
not so womanish, among them many have practiced heavenly wisdom; and a
woman hearing that her child had fallen in battle, straightway asked,
“And in what state are the affairs of the city?” Another truly wise,
when being garlanded  <span id="fr_1704"></span>[1705](#fn_1704.md) he
heard that his son had fallen for his country, took off the garland, and
asked which of the two; then when he had learnt which it was,
immediately put the garland on again. Many also gave their sons and
their daughters for slaughter in honor of their evil deities; and
Lacedæmonian women exhort their sons either to bring back their shield
safe from war, or to be brought back dead upon it. Wherefore I am
ashamed that the heathen show true wisdom in these matters, and we act
unseemly. Those who know nothing about the Resurrection act the part of
those who know; and those who know, the part of those who know not. And
ofttimes many do through shame of men what they do not for the sake of
God. For women of the higher class neither tear  <span
id="fr_1705"></span>[1706](#fn_1705.md) their hair nor bare their arms;
which very thing is a most heavy charge against them, not because they
do not strip themselves, but because they act as they do not through
piety, but that they may not be thought to disgrace themselves. Is their
shame stronger than grief, and the fear of God not stronger? And must
not this deserve severest censure? What the rich women do because of
their riches, the poor ought to do through fear of God; but at present
it is quite the contrary; the rich act wisely through vainglory, the
poor through littleness of soul act unseemly. What is worse than this
anomaly? We do all for men, all for the <span id="page_229">p.
229</span> <span id="iv.lxiv-Page_229"></span> things of earth. And
these people utter words full of madness and much ridicule. The Lord
saith indeed, “Blessed are they that mourn” ( [Matt. v.
4](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#004) <span id="iv.lxiv-p98.3"></span> .md),
speaking of those who mourn  <span id="fr_1706"></span>[1707](#fn_1706.md)
for their sins; and no one mourneth that kind of mourning, nor careth
for a lost soul; but this other we were not bidden to practice, and we
practice it.  <span id="fr_1707"></span>[1708](#fn_1707.md) “What then?”
saith some one, “Is it possible being man not to weep?” No, neither do I
 <span id="fr_1708"></span>[1709](#fn_1708.md) forbid weeping, but I forbid
the beating yourselves, the weeping immoderately.  <span
id="fr_1709"></span>[1710](#fn_1709.md) I am neither brutal nor cruel. I
know that our nature asks  <span id="fr_1710"></span>[1711](#fn_1710.md)
and seeks for its friends and daily companions; it cannot but be
grieved. As also Christ showed, for He wept over Lazarus. So do thou;
weep, but gently, but with decency, but with the fear of God. If so thou
weepest, thou dost so not as disbelieving the Resurrection, but as not
enduring the separation. Since even over those who are leaving us, and
departing to foreign lands, we weep, yet we do this not as despairing.

<span id="iv.lxiv-p104"></span> \[5.\] And so do thou weep, as if thou
wert sending one on his way to another land. These things I say, not as
giving a rule of action, but as condescending (to human infirmity). For
if the dead man have been a sinner, and one who hath in many things
offended God, it behooveth to weep (or rather not to weep only, since
that is of no avail to him, but to do what one can to procure  <span
id="fr_1711"></span>[1712](#fn_1711.md) some comfort for him by almsgivings
and offerings;  <span id="fr_1712"></span>[1713](#fn_1712) .md) but it
behooveth also to rejoice at this, that his wickedness hath been cut
short. If he have been righteous, it again  <span
id="fr_1713"></span>[1714](#fn_1713.md) behooveth to be glad, that what is
his is now placed in security, free from the uncertainty of the future;
if young, that he hath been quickly delivered from the common evils of
life; if old, that he hath departed after taking to satiety that which
is held desirable. But thou, neglecting to consider these things,
incitest thy hand-maidens to act as mourners, as if forsooth thou wert
honoring the dead, when it is an act of extreme dishonor.  <span
id="fr_1714"></span>[1715](#fn_1714.md) For honor to the dead is not
wailings and lamentings, but hymns and psalmodies and an excellent life.
The good man when he departeth, shall depart with angels, though no man
be near his remains; but the corrupt, though he have a city to attend
his funeral, shall be nothing profited. Wilt thou honor him who is gone?
Honor him in another way, by alms-deeds, by acts of beneficence and
public service.  <span id="fr_1715"></span>[1716](#fn_1715.md) What avail
the many lamentations? And I have heard also another grievous thing,
that many women attract lovers by their sad cries, acquiring by the
fervor of their wailings a reputation for affection to their husbands. O
devilish purpose! O Satanic invention!  <span
id="fr_1716"></span>[1717](#fn_1716.md) How long are we but dust and ashes,
how long but blood and flesh? Look we up to heaven, take we thought of
spiritual things.  <span id="fr_1717"></span>[1718](#fn_1717.md) How shall
we be able to rebuke the heathen,  <span
id="fr_1718"></span>[1719](#fn_1718.md) how to exhort them, when we do such
things? How shall we dispute with them concerning the Resurrection? How
about the rest of heavenly wisdom? How shall we ourselves live without
fear? Knowest not thou that of grief  <span
id="fr_1719"></span>[1720](#fn_1719.md) cometh death? for grief darkening
 <span id="fr_1720"></span>[1721](#fn_1720.md) the seeing part of the soul
not only hindereth it from perceiving anything that it ought, but also
worketh it great mischief. In one way then we offend God, and advantage
neither ourselves nor him who is gone; in the other we please God, and
gain honor among men. If we sink not down ourselves, He will soon remove
the remains of our despondency; if we are discontented, He permitteth us
to be given up to grief. If we are thankful, we shall not despond. “But
how,” saith some one, “is it possible not to be grieved, when one has
lost a son or daughter or wife?” I say not, “not to grieve,” but “not to
do so immoderately.” For if we consider that God hath taken away, and
that the husband or son which we had was mortal, we shall soon receive
comfort. To be discontented is the act of those who seek for something
higher than their nature. Thou wast born man, and mortal; why then
grievest thou that what is natural hath come to pass?  Grievest thou
that thou art nourished by eating? Seekest thou to live without this?
 <span id="fr_1721"></span>[1722](#fn_1721.md) Act thus also in the case of
death, and being mortal seek not as yet for immortality. Once for all
this thing hath been appointed. Grieve not therefore, nor play the
mourner, but submit to laws laid on all alike. Grieve for thy sins; this
is good mourning, this is highest wisdom. Let us then mourn for this
cause continually, that we may obtain the joy which is there, through
the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory
for ever and ever.  Amen.
