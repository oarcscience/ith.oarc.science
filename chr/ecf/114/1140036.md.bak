<span id="iv.xxxiii-p3"></span>“The Father loveth the Son, and hath
given all things into His hand. He that believeth on the Son hath
everlasting life, and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life;
but the wrath of God abideth on him.”

<span id="iv.xxxiii-p4"></span> \[1.\] <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.xxxiii-p4.1"></span>Great</span> is shown to be in all things the
gain of humility.  <span id="fr_769"></span>[770](#fn_769.md) Thus it is
that we have brought arts to perfection, not by learning them all at
once from our teachers; it is thus that we have built cities, putting
them together slowly, little by little; it is thus that we maintain
 <span id="fr_770"></span>[771](#fn_770.md) our life. And marvel not if the
thing has so much power in matters pertaining to this life, when in
spiritual things one may find that great is the power of this wisdom.
For so the Jews were enabled to be delivered from their idolatry, being
led on gently and little by little, and hearing from the first nothing
sublime concerning either doctrine or life. So after the coming of
Christ, when it was the time for higher doctrines, the Apostles brought
over all men without at first uttering anything sublime. And so Christ
appears to have spoken to most at the beginning, and so John did now,
speaking of Him as of some wonderful man, and darkly introducing high
matter.

<span id="iv.xxxiii-p7"></span> For instance, when commencing he spake
thus: “A man cannot receive anything of himself”  <span
id="fr_771"></span>[772](#fn_771.md) ( [John
3.27](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#027.md)<span id="iv.xxxiii-p8.6"></span>
): then after adding a high expression, and saying, “He that cometh from
heaven  <span id="fr_772"></span>[773](#fn_772.md) is above all,” he again
brings down his discourse to what is lowly, and besides many other
things saith this, that “God giveth not the Spirit by measure.” Then he
proceeds to say, “The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things
into His hand.” And after that, knowing that great is the force of
punishment,  <span id="fr_773"></span>[774](#fn_773.md) and that the many
are not so much led by the promise of good things as by the threat of
the terrible, he concludes his discourse with these words; “He that
believeth on the Son hath everlasting life; but he that believeth not
the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.” Here
again he refers the account of punishment to the Father, for he saith
not “the wrath of the Son,” (yet He is the Judge,) but sets over them
the Father, desiring so the more to terrify them.

<span id="iv.xxxiii-p11"></span>“Is it then enough,” saith one, “to
believe on the Son, that one may have eternal life?” By no means. And
hear Christ Himself declaring this, and saying, “Not every one that
saith unto Me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven” (
[Matt. vii. 21](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#021.md) <span
id="iv.xxxiii-p11.1"></span> ); and the blasphemy against the Spirit is
enough of itself to cast a man into hell. But why speak I of a portion
of doctrine? Though a man believe rightly on the Father, the Son, and
the Holy Ghost, yet if he lead not a right life, his faith will avail
nothing towards his salvation. Therefore when He saith, “This is life
eternal, that they may know Thee the only true God” ( [John
17.3](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#003.md)<span id="iv.xxxiii-p11.2"></span>
), let us not suppose that the (knowledge) spoken of is sufficient for
our salvation; we need besides this a most exact life and conversation.
Since though he has said here, “He that believeth on the Son hath
eternal life,” and in the same place something even stronger, (for he
weaves his discourse not of blessings only, but of their contraries
also, speaking thus: “He that believeth not the Son shall not see life,
but the wrath of God abideth on him”;) yet not even from this do we
assert that faith alone is sufficient to salvation. And the directions
for living given in many places of the Gospels show this. Therefore he
did not say, “This by itself is eternal life,” nor, “He that doth but
believe on the Son hath eternal life,” but by both expressions he
declared this, that the thing  <span id="fr_774"></span>[775](#fn_774.md)
doth contain life, yet that if a right conversation follow not, there
will follow a heavy punishment. And he did not say, “awaiteth him,” but,
“abideth on him,” that is, “shall never remove from him.” For that thou
mayest not think that the “shall not see life,” is a temporary death,
but mayest believe that the punishment is continual, he hath put this
expression to show that it rests  <span
id="fr_775"></span>[776](#fn_775.md) upon him continually. And this he has
done, by these very words forcing them on  <span
id="fr_776"></span>[777](#fn_776.md) to Christ. Therefore he gave not the
admonition to them in particular, but made it universal, the manner
which best might bring them over. For he did not say, “if ye believe,”
and, “if ye believe not,” but made his speech general, so that his words
might be free from suspicion. And this he has done yet more strongly
than Christ. For Christ saith, “He that believeth not is condemned
already,” but John saith, “shall not see life, but the wrath of God
abideth on him.” With good cause; for it was a different thing for a man
to speak of himself and for another to speak of him. They would have
thought that Christ spake often of these things from self-love, and that
he was a boaster; but John was clear from all suspicion. And if at a
later time, Christ also used stronger <span id="page_106">p. 106</span>
<span id="iv.xxxiii-Page_106"></span> expressions, it was when they had
begun to conceive an exalted opinion of Him.

<span id="iv.xxxiii-p15"></span> [John
4.1-3](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#001.md)<span
id="iv.xxxiii-p15.1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.xxxiii-p15.2"></span></span> . “When therefore Jesus  <span
id="fr_777"></span>[778](#fn_777.md) knew how the Pharisees had heard that
Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John, (though Jesus Himself
baptized not but His disciples,) He left Judæa, and departed again into
Galilee.”

<span id="iv.xxxiii-p17"></span> He indeed baptized not, but they who
carried the news, desiring to excite their hearers to envy, so reported.
“Wherefore then ‘departed’ He?” Not from fear, but to take away  <span
id="fr_778"></span>[779](#fn_778.md) their malice, and to soften their
envy. He was indeed able to restrain them when they came against Him,
but this He would not do continually, that the Dispensation of the Flesh
might not be disbelieved. For had He often been seized and escaped, this
would have been suspected by many; therefore for the most part, He
rather orders matters after the manner of a man. And as He desired it to
be believed that He was God, so also that, being God, He bore the flesh;
therefore even after the Resurrection, He said to the disciple, “Handle
Me and see, for a spirit hath not flesh and bones” ( [Luke xxiv.
39](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#039.md) <span id="iv.xxxiii-p18.3"></span>
); therefore also He rebuked Peter when he said, “Be it far from Thee,
this shall not be unto thee.” ( [Matt. xvi.
22](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#022.md) <span id="iv.xxxiii-p18.4"></span>
.) So much was this matter an object of care to Him.

<span id="iv.xxxiii-p19"></span> \[2.\] For this is no small part of the
doctrines of the Church; it is the chief point of the salvation wrought
for us;  <span id="fr_779"></span>[780](#fn_779.md) by which all has been
brought to pass, and has had success, for it was thus that the bonds of
death were loosed, sin taken away, and the curse abolished, and ten
thousand blessings introduced into our life. And therefore He especially
desired that the Dispensation should be believed, as having been the
root and fountain of innumerable goods to us.

<span id="iv.xxxiii-p21"></span> Yet while acting thus in regard of His
Humanity,  <span id="fr_780"></span>[781](#fn_780.md) He did not allow His
Divinity to be overcast. And so, after His departure He again employed
the same language as before. For He went not away into Galilee simply,
 <span id="fr_781"></span>[782](#fn_781.md) but in order to effect certain
important matters, those among the Samaritans; nor did He dispense these
matters simply, but with the wisdom that belonged to  <span
id="fr_782"></span>[783](#fn_782.md) Him, and so as not to leave to the
Jews any pretense even of a shameless excuse for themselves. And to this
the Evangelist points when he says,

<span id="iv.xxxiii-p25"></span> [John
4.4](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#004.md)<span id="iv.xxxiii-p25.1"></span>
. “And He must needs go through Samaria.”

<span id="iv.xxxiii-p26"></span>Showing that He made this the by-work of
the journey. Which also the Apostles did; for just as they, when
persecuted by the Jews, came to the Gentiles; so also Christ, when the
Jews drove Him out, then took the Samaritans in hand, as He did also in
the case of the Syrophenician woman. And this was done that all defense
might be cut away from the Jews, and that they might not be able to say,
“He left us, and went to the uncircumcised.” And therefore the disciples
excusing themselves said, “It was necessary that the Word of God should
first have been spoken unto you; but seeing ye judge yourselves unworthy
of everlasting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles.” ( [Acts xiii.
46](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#046.md) <span id="iv.xxxiii-p26.1"></span>
.) And He saith again Himself, “I am not come  <span
id="fr_783"></span>[784](#fn_783.md) but unto the lost sheep of the house
of Israel” ( [Matt. xv. 24](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#024.md) <span
id="iv.xxxiii-p27.4"></span> ); and again, “It is not meet to take the
children’s bread, and to give  <span id="fr_784"></span>[785](#fn_784.md)
it to dogs.” But when they drove Him away, they opened a door to the
Gentiles. Yet not so did He come to the Gentiles expressly, but in
passing.  <span id="fr_785"></span>[786](#fn_785.md) In passing then,

<span id="iv.xxxiii-p30"></span> [John
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#005.md),
[6](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#006.md)<span id="iv.xxxiii-p30.1"></span> .
“He cometh to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the
parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph. Now Jacob’s well was
there.”

<span id="iv.xxxiii-p31"></span>Why is the Evangelist exact about the
place? It is, that when thou hearest the woman say, “Jacob our father
gave us this well,” thou mayest not think it strange. For this was the
place where Levi and Simeon, being angry because of Dinah, wrought that
cruel slaughter. And it may be worth while to relate from what sources
the Samaritans were made up; since all this country is called Samaria.
Whence then did they receive their name? The mountain was called “Somor”
from its owner ( [1 Kings xvi. 24](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#024.md)
<span id="iv.xxxiii-p31.1"></span> ): as also Esaias saith, “and the
head of Ephraim is Somoron” ( [Isa. vii.
9](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#009.md) <span id="iv.xxxiii-p31.2"></span> ,
LXX.), but the inhabitants were termed not “Samaritans” but
“Israelites.” But as time went on, they offended God, and in the reign
of Pekah, Tiglath-Pileser came up, and took many cities, and set upon
Elah, and having slain him, gave the kingdom to Hoshea.  <span
id="fr_786"></span>[787](#fn_786.md) ( [2 Kings xv.
29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#029.md) <span id="iv.xxxiii-p32.6"></span>
.) Against him Shalmaneser came and took other cities, and made them
subject and tributary. ( [2 Kings xvii.
3](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#003.md) <span id="iv.xxxiii-p32.7"></span>
.) At first he yielded, but afterwards he revolted from the Assyrian
rule, and betook himself to the alliance of the Ethiopians.  <span
id="fr_787"></span>[788](#fn_787.md) The Assyrian learnt this, and having
made war upon them and destroyed their cities, he no longer allowed the
nation to remain there, because he had such suspicions that they would
revolt. ( [2 Kings xvii. 4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#004.md) <span
id="iv.xxxiii-p33.2"></span> .) But he carried them to Babylon and to
the Medes, and having brought thence nations from divers places, planted
them <span id="page_107">p. 107</span> <span
id="iv.xxxiii-Page_107"></span> in Samaria, that his dominion for the
future might be sure, his own people occupying the place.  After this,
God, desiring to show that He had not given up the Jews through
weakness, but because of the sins of those who were given up, sent lions
against the foreigners,  <span id="fr_788"></span>[789](#fn_788.md) who
ravaged all their nation. These things were reported to the king, and he
sent a priest to deliver to them the laws of God. Still not even so did
they desist wholly from their impiety, but only by halves. But as time
went on, they in turn abandoned  <span id="fr_789"></span>[790](#fn_789.md)
their idols, and worshiped God. And when things were in this state, the
Jews having returned, ever after entertained a jealous feeling towards
them as strangers and enemies, and called them from the name of the
mountain, “Samaritans.” From this cause also there was no little rivalry
between them. The Samaritans did not use all the Scriptures, but
received the writings of Moses only, and made but little account of
those of the Prophets. Yet they were eager to thrust themselves into the
noble Jewish stock, and prided themselves upon Abraham, and called
 <span id="fr_790"></span>[791](#fn_790.md) him their forefather, as being
of Chaldæa; and Jacob also they called their father, as being his
descendant. But the Jews abominated them as well as all (other nations).
Wherefore they reproached Christ with this, saying, “Thou art a
Samaritan, and hast a devil.” ( [John
8.48](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#048.md)<span id="iv.xxxiii-p36.3"></span>
.) And for this reason in the parable of the man that went down from
Jerusalem to Jericho, Christ makes the man who showed pity upon him to
have been “a Samaritan” ( [Luke x. 33](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#033.md)
<span id="iv.xxxiii-p36.4"></span> ), one who by them was deemed mean,
contemptible, and abominable. And in the case of the ten lepers, He
calls one a “stranger” on this account, (for “he was a Samaritan,”) and
He gave His charge to the disciples in these words, “Go not into the way
of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not.” (
[Matt. x. 5](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#005.md) <span
id="iv.xxxiii-p36.5"></span> .)

<span id="iv.xxxiii-p37"></span> \[3.\] Nor was it merely to describe
the place that the Evangelist has reminded us of Jacob, but to show that
the rejection of the Jews had happened long ago. For during the time of
their forefathers these Jews possessed the land, and not the Samaritans;
and the very possessions which not being theirs, their forefathers had
gotten, they being theirs, had lost by their sloth and transgressions.
So little  <span id="fr_791"></span>[792](#fn_791.md) is the advantage of
excellent ancestors, if their descendants be not like them. Moreover,
the foreigners when they had only made trial of the lions, straightway
returned to the right worship  <span id="fr_792"></span>[793](#fn_792.md)
of the Jews, while they, after enduring such inflictions, were not even
so brought to a sound mind.

<span id="iv.xxxiii-p40"></span> To this place Christ now came, ever
rejecting a sedentary and soft  <span id="fr_793"></span>[794](#fn_793.md)
life, and exhibiting  <span id="fr_794"></span>[795](#fn_794.md) one
laborious and active. He useth no beast to carry Him, but walketh so
much on a stretch, as even to be wearied with His journeying. And this
He ever teacheth, that a man should work for himself, go without
superfluities, and not have many wants. Nay, so desirous is He that we
should be alienated from superfluities, that He abridgeth many even of
necessary things. Wherefore He said, “Foxes have holes, and birds of the
air have nests, but the Son of Man hath not where to lay His head.” (
[Matt. viii. 20](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#020.md) <span
id="iv.xxxiii-p42.3"></span> .) Therefore He spent most of His time in
the mountains, and in the deserts, not by day only, but also by night.
And this David declared when he said, “He shall drink of the brook in
the way” ( [Ps. cx. 7](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#007.md) <span
id="iv.xxxiii-p42.4"></span> ): by this showing His frugal  <span
id="fr_795"></span>[796](#fn_795.md) way of life. This too the Evangelist
shows in this place.

<span id="iv.xxxiii-p44"></span> [John
4.6-8](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#006.md)<span
id="iv.xxxiii-p44.1"></span> . “Jesus therefore, being wearied with His
journey, sat thus by the well; and it was about the sixth hour. There
cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water. Jesus saith unto her, Give Me
to drink. For His disciples were gone away into the city to buy meat.”

<span id="iv.xxxiii-p45"></span> Hence we learn His activity in
journeying, His carelessness about food, and how He treated it as a
matter of minor importance.  <span id="fr_796"></span>[797](#fn_796.md) And
so the disciples were taught to use the like disposition themselves; for
they took with them no provisions for the road. And this another
Evangelist declares, saying, that when He spake to them concerning “the
leaven of the Pharisees” ( [Matt. xvi.
6](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#006.md) <span id="iv.xxxiii-p46.2"></span>
), they thought that it was because they carried no bread; and when he
introduces them plucking the ears of corn, and eating ( [Matt. xii.
1](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#001.md) <span id="iv.xxxiii-p46.3"></span>
), and when he saith that Jesus came to the fig-tree by reason of hunger
( [Matt. xxi. 18](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#018.md) <span
id="iv.xxxiii-p46.4"></span> ), it is for nothing else but only to
instruct us by all these to despise the belly, and not to deem that its
service is anxiously to be attended to. Observe them, for instance, in
this place neither bringing anything with them, nor because they brought
not anything, caring for this at the very beginning and early part of
the day, but buying food at the time when all other people were taking
their meal.  <span id="fr_797"></span>[798](#fn_797.md) Not like us, who
the instant we rise from our beds attend to this before anything else,
calling cooks and butlers, and giving our directions with all
earnestness, applying ourselves afterwards to other matters, preferring
temporal things to spiritual, valuing those things as necessary which we
ought to have deemed of less importance.  <span
id="fr_798"></span>[799](#fn_798.md) Therefore all things are in confusion.
We ought, on the <span id="page_108">p. 108</span> <span
id="iv.xxxiii-Page_108"></span> contrary, making much account of all
spiritual things, after having accomplished these, then to apply
ourselves to the others.

<span id="iv.xxxiii-p49"></span> And in this place it is not His
laboriousness alone that is shown, but also His freedom from pride; not
merely by His being tired, nor by His sitting by the way-side, but by
His having been left alone, and His disciples having been separated
 <span id="fr_799"></span>[800](#fn_799.md) from Him. And yet it was in His
power, if He had willed it, either not to have sent them all away, or
when they departed to have had other ministers. But He would not; for so
He accustomed His disciples to tread all pride beneath their feet.

<span id="iv.xxxiii-p51"></span> “And what marvel,” saith one, “if they
were moderate in their wishes, since they were fishermen and
tentmakers?” Yes! Fishermen and tentmakers they were; but they had in a
moment  <span id="fr_800"></span>[801](#fn_800.md) mounted even to the
height of heaven, and had become more honorable than all earthly kings,
being deemed worthy to become the companions of the Lord of the world,
and to follow Him whom all beheld with awe. And ye know this too, that
those men especially who are of humble origin, whenever they gain
distinction, are the more easily lifted up to folly, because they are
quite ignorant how to bear their sudden  <span
id="fr_801"></span>[802](#fn_801.md) honor. Restraining them therefore in
their present humblemindedness, He taught them always to be moderate,
 <span id="fr_802"></span>[803](#fn_802.md) and never to require any to
wait upon them.

<span id="iv.xxxiii-p55"></span> “He therefore,” saith the Evangelist,
“being wearied with His journey, sat  <span
id="fr_803"></span>[804](#fn_803.md) thus at the well.”  <span
id="fr_804"></span>[805](#fn_804.md)

<span id="iv.xxxiii-p58"></span>Seest thou that His sitting was because
of weariness? because of the heat? because of his waiting for His
disciples? He knew, indeed, what should take place among the Samaritans,
but it was not for this that He came principally; yet, though He came
not for this, it behooved not to reject the woman who came to Him, when
she manifested such a desire to learn. The Jews, when He was even coming
to them, drove Him away; they of the Gentiles, when He was proceeding in
another direction, drew Him to them. They envied, these believed on Him.
They were angry with, these revered and worshiped Him. What then? Was He
to overlook the salvation of so many, to send away such noble zeal? This
would have been unworthy of His lovingkindness. Therefore He ordered all
the matter in hand with the Wisdom which became Him. He sat resting His
body and cooling It by the fountain; for it was the very middle of the
day, as the Evangelist has declared, when he says,

<span id="iv.xxxiii-p59"></span>“It was about the sixth hour.”

<span id="iv.xxxiii-p60"></span> He sat “thus.” What meaneth “thus”? Not
upon a throne, not upon a cushion, but simply, and as He was,  <span
id="fr_805"></span>[806](#fn_805.md) upon the ground.

<span id="iv.xxxiii-p62"></span> [John
4.7](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#007.md)<span id="iv.xxxiii-p62.1"></span>
. “There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water.”

<span id="iv.xxxiii-p63"></span>\[4.\] Observe how he declareth that the
woman came forth for another purpose, in every way silencing the
shameless gainsaying of the Jews, that none might say that He acted in
opposition to His own command, bidding (His disciples) not to enter into
any city of the Samaritans, yet conversing with Samaritans. ( [Matt. x.
5](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#005.md) <span id="iv.xxxiii-p63.1"></span>
.) And therefore the Evangelist has put,

<span id="iv.xxxiii-p64"></span> [John
4.8](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#008.md)<span id="iv.xxxiii-p64.1"></span>
. “For His disciples were gone away into the city to buy meat.”  <span
id="fr_806"></span>[807](#fn_806.md)

<span id="iv.xxxiii-p66"></span> Bringing in many reasons for His
conversation with her. What doth the woman? When she heard, “Give Me to
drink,”  <span id="fr_807"></span>[808](#fn_807.md) she very wisely makes
the speech of Christ an occasion for a question, and saith,

<span id="iv.xxxiii-p68"></span> [John
4.9](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#009.md)<span id="iv.xxxiii-p68.1"></span>
. “How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a
Samaritan? For the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.”

<span id="iv.xxxiii-p69"></span> And whence did she suppose Him to be a
Jew? From His dress, perhaps, and from His dialect. Observe, I pray you,
how considerate the woman was. If there was need of caution, Jesus
needed it, not she. For she doth not say, “The Samaritans have no
dealings with the Jews,” but, “The Jews do not admit the Samaritans.”
Yet still, although free herself from blame,  <span
id="fr_808"></span>[809](#fn_808.md) when she supposed that another was
falling into it she would not even so hold her peace, but corrected, as
she thought, what was done unlawfully. Perhaps some one may ask how it
was that Jesus asked drink of her, when the law  <span
id="fr_809"></span>[810](#fn_809.md) did not permit it. If it be answered
that it was because He knew beforehand that she would not give it, then
for this very reason He ought not to have asked. What then can we say?
That the rejecting such observances as these was now a matter of
indifference to Him; for He who induced others to do them away, would
much more Himself pass them by. “Not that which goeth in,” saith He,
“defileth a man, but that which goeth out.” ( [Matt. xv.

.) And this conversation with the woman would be no slight charge
against the Jews. For often did He draw them to Himself, both by words
and deeds, but they would not attend; while observe how she is detained
by a simple request.  <span id="fr_810"></span>[811](#fn_810.md) For He did
not as yet enter on the prosecution of this business,  <span
id="fr_811"></span>[812](#fn_811.md) nor the way,  <span
id="fr_812"></span>[813](#fn_812.md) yet if any came to Him He did not
prevent them. And to the disciples also He said thus, “Into <span
id="page_109">p. 109</span> <span id="iv.xxxiii-Page_109"></span> any
city of the Samaritans enter ye not.” He did not say, “And when they
come to you, reject them”; that would have been very unworthy of His
lovingkindness. And therefore He answered the woman, and said,

<span id="iv.xxxiii-p75"></span> [John
4.10](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#010.md)<span id="iv.xxxiii-p75.1"></span>
. “If thou knewest the gift of God and who it is that saith to thee,
Give Me to drink, thou wouldest have asked of Him, and He would have
given thee living water.”

<span id="iv.xxxiii-p76"></span>First, He showeth that she is worthy to
hear and not to be overlooked, and then He revealeth Himself. For she,
as soon as she had learnt who He was, would straightway hearken and
attend to Him; which none can say of the Jews, for they, when they had
learned, asked nothing of Him, nor did they desire to be informed on any
profitable matter, but insulted and drove Him away. But when the woman
had heard these words, observe how gently she answers:

<span id="iv.xxxiii-p77"></span> [John
4.11](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#011.md)<span id="iv.xxxiii-p77.1"></span>
. “Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep; from
whence then hast thou that living water?”

<span id="iv.xxxiii-p78"></span> Already He hath raised her from her low
opinion of Him, and from deeming that He is a common man. For not
without a reason doth she here call Him, “Lord”;  <span
id="fr_813"></span>[814](#fn_813.md) but assigning to Him high honor. That
she spake these words to honor Him, is plain from what is said
afterwards, since she did not laugh nor mock, but doubted for a while.
And wonder not if she did not at once perceive all, for neither did
Nicodemus. What saith he? “How can these things be?” and again, “How can
a man be born when he is old?” and again, “Can he enter the second time
into his mother’s womb, and be born?” But this woman more reverently: 
“Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep; from whence
then hast thou that living water?” Christ said one thing, and she
imagined another, hearing nothing beyond the words, and as yet unable to
form any lofty thought. Yet, had she spoken hastily, she might have
said, “If thou hadst had that living water, thou wouldest not have asked
of me, but wouldest rather have provided for thyself. Thou art but a
boaster.” But she said nothing like this; she answers with much
gentleness, both at first and afterwards. For at first she saith, “How
is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me?” she saith not, as
though speaking to an alien and an enemy, “Far be it from me to give to
thee, who art a foe and a stranger to our nation.” And afterwards again,
when she heard Him utter great words, a thing at which enemies are most
annoyed, she did not mock nor deride  <span
id="fr_814"></span>[815](#fn_814.md) ; but what saith she?

<span id="iv.xxxiii-p81"></span> [John
4.12](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#012.md)<span id="iv.xxxiii-p81.1"></span>
. “Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and
drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?”

<span id="iv.xxxiii-p82"></span> Observe how she thrusts herself into
the noble stock of the Jews. For what she saith is somewhat of this
kind: “Jacob used this water, and had nothing better to give us.” And
this she said showing that from the first answer (of Christ) she had
conceived a great and sublime thought; for by the words, “he drank
thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle,” she implies nothing
else, than that she had a notion of a better Water, but that she  <span
id="fr_815"></span>[816](#fn_815.md) never found it, nor clearly knew it.
More clearly to explain what she means to say, the sense of her words is
this: “Thou canst not assert that Jacob gave us this well, and used
another himself; for he and his children drank of this one, which they
would not have done if they had had another and a better. Now of the
water of this well it is not in thy power to give me, and thou canst not
have another and a better, unless thou dost confess that thou art
greater than Jacob. Whence then hast thou that water which thou
promisest that thou wilt give us?” The Jews did not converse with Him
thus mildly, and yet He spake to them on the same subject, making
mention of the like water, but they profited nothing; and when He made
mention of Abraham, they even attempted to stone Him. Not so does this
woman approach Him; but with much gentleness, in the midst of the heat,
at noon, she with much patience saith and hears all, and does not so
much as think of what the Jews most probably would have asserted, that
“This fellow is mad, and beside himself: he hath tied me to this fount
and well, giving me nothing, but using big words”; no, she endures and
perseveres until she has found what she seeks.

<span id="iv.xxxiii-p84"></span> \[5.\] If now a woman of Samaria is so
earnest to learn something profitable, if she abides by Christ though
not as yet knowing Him, what pardon shall we obtain, who both knowing
 <span id="fr_816"></span>[817](#fn_816.md) Him, and being not by a well,
nor in a desert place, nor at noon-day, nor beneath the scorching
sunbeams, but at morning-tide, and beneath a roof like this, enjoying
shade and comfort,  <span id="fr_817"></span>[818](#fn_817.md) yet cannot
endure to hear anything that is said, but are wearied  <span
id="fr_818"></span>[819](#fn_818.md) by it. Not such was that woman; so
occupied was she by Jesus’ words, that she even called others to hear
them. The Jews, on the contrary, not only did not call, but even
hindered and impeded those who desired to come to Him,  <span
id="fr_819"></span>[820](#fn_819.md) saying, “See, have any of the rulers
believed on him? but this people, which knoweth not the Law, are
cursed.”  <span id="fr_820"></span>[821](#fn_820.md) Let us then imitate
this woman of Samaria; let us commune with Christ. For even now He
standeth in the midst of us, speaking to us by the Prophets and
Disciples; let us hear and obey. How long <span id="page_110">p.
110</span> <span id="iv.xxxiii-Page_110"></span> shall we live uselessly
and in vain? Because, not to do what is well-pleasing to God is to live
uselessly, or rather not merely uselessly, but to our own hurt; for when
we have spent the time which has been given us on no good purpose, we
shall depart this life to suffer severest punishment for our
unseasonable extravagance. For it can never be that a man who has
received money to trade with, and then has eaten it up, shall have it
 <span id="fr_821"></span>[822](#fn_821.md) required at his hands by the
man who intrusted it to him; and that one who has spent such a life as
ours to no purpose shall escape punishment. It was not for this that God
brought us into this present life, and breathed into us a soul, that we
should make use of the present time only,  <span
id="fr_822"></span>[823](#fn_822.md) but that we should do all our business
with a regard to the life which is to come. Things irrational only are
useful for the present life; but we have an immortal soul, that we may
use every means to prepare ourselves for that other life. For if one
enquire the use of horses and asses and oxen, and other such-like
animals, we shall tell him that it is nothing else but only to minister
to the present life; but this cannot be said of us; our best condition
is that which follows on our departure hence; and we must do all that we
may shine there, that we may join the choir of Angels, and stand before
the King continually, through endless  <span
id="fr_823"></span>[824](#fn_823.md) ages. And therefore the soul is
immortal, and the body shall be immortal too, that we may enjoy the
never-ending blessings. But if, when heavenly things are proffered thee,
thou remainest nailed to earth, consider what an insult is offered to
thy Benefactor, when He holdeth forth to thee things above, and thou,
making no great account of them choosest earth instead. And therefore,
as despised by thee, He hath threatened thee with hell; that thou mayest
learn hence of what great blessings thou deprivest thyself. God grant
that none make trial of that punishment, but that having been
well-pleasing to Christ, we may obtain everlasting blessings, through
the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ; to whom with the
Father and the Holy Ghost be glory, now and ever, and world without end.
Amen.
