<span id="iv.x-p1"></span> <span class="c15"><span
id="iv.x-p1.1"></span>Homily VIII.</span>

<span id="iv.x-p2"></span> <span id="iv.x-p2.1"></span> <span
class="c1"><span id="iv.x-p2.2"></span>[John i.
9](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#009.md)<span id="iv.x-p2.3"></span></span>

<span id="iv.x-p3"></span>“That was the true Light, which lighteth every
man that cometh into the world.”

<span id="iv.x-p4"></span> \[1.\] <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.x-p4.1"></span>Nothing</span> hinders us from handling to-day
also the same words, since before we were prevented by the setting forth
of doctrines, from considering all that was read. Where now are those
who deny that He is true God? for here He is called “the true Light” (
[John 14.6](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#006.md)<span id="iv.x-p4.2"></span>
), and elsewhere very “Truth” and very “Life.” That saying we will
discuss more clearly when we come to the place; but at present we must
for a while be speaking to your Charity of that other matter.

<span id="iv.x-p5"></span> If He “lighteth every man that cometh into
the world,” how is it that so many continue unenlightened? for not all
have known the majesty of Christ. How then doth He “light every man”? He
lighteth all as far as in Him lies. But if some, wilfully closing the
eyes of their mind, would not receive the rays of that Light, their
darkness arises not from the nature of the Light, but from their own
wickedness, who willfully deprive themselves of the gift.  For the grace
is shed forth upon all, turning itself back neither from Jew, nor Greek,
nor Barbarian, nor Scythian, nor free, nor bond, nor male, nor female,
nor old, nor young, but admitting all alike, and inviting with an equal
regard. And those who are not willing to enjoy this gift, ought in
justice to impute their blindness to themselves; for if when the gate is
opened to all, and there is none to hinder, any being willfully evil
 <span id="fr_173"></span>[174](#fn_173.md) remain without, they perish
through none other, but only through their own wickedness.

<span id="iv.x-p7"></span> [John
1.10](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#010.md)<span id="iv.x-p7.1"></span> . “He
was in the world.”

<span id="iv.x-p8"></span> But not as of equal duration with the world.
Away with the thought. Wherefore he adds, “And the world was made by
Him”; thus leading thee up again to the eternal  <span
id="fr_174"></span>[175](#fn_174.md) existence of the Only-Begotten. For he
who has heard that this universe is His work, though he be very dull,
though he be a hater, though he be an enemy of the glory of God, will
certainly, willing or unwilling, be forced to confess that the maker is
before his works. Whence wonder always comes over me at the madness of
Paul of Samosata, who dared to look in the face so manifest a truth, and
voluntarily threw himself down the preci <span id="page_30">p. 30</span>
<span id="iv.x-Page_30"></span> pice.  <span
id="fr_175"></span>[176](#fn_175.md) For he erred not ignorantly but with
full knowledge, being in the same case as the Jews. For as they, looking
to men, gave up sound faith, knowing that he was the only-begotten Son
of God, but not confessing Him, because of their rulers, lest they
should be cast out of the synagogue; so it is said that he, to gratify a
certain woman,  <span id="fr_176"></span>[177](#fn_176.md) sold his own
salvation. A powerful thing, powerful indeed, is the tyranny of
vainglory; it is able to make blind the eyes even of the wise, except
they be sober; for if the taking of gifts can effect this, much more
will the yet more violent feeling of this passion. Wherefore Jesus said
to the Jews, “How can ye believe, which receive honor one of another,
and seek not the honor that cometh from God only?” ( [John
5.44](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#044)<span id="iv.x-p11.1"></span> ..md)

<span id="iv.x-p12"></span> “And the world knew Him not.” By “the world”
he here means the multitude, which is corrupt, and closely attached
 <span id="fr_177"></span>[178](#fn_177.md) to earthly things, the common
 <span id="fr_178"></span>[179](#fn_178.md) turbulent, silly people. For
the friends and favorites  <span id="fr_179"></span>[180](#fn_179.md) of
God all knew Him, even before His coming in the flesh. Concerning the
Patriarch Christ Himself speaks by name, “that your father Abraham
rejoiced to see My day, and he saw it, and was glad.” ( [John
8.56](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#056)<span id="iv.x-p15.2"></span> ..md)
And concerning David, confuting the Jews He said, “How then doth David
in spirit call Him Lord, saying, the Lord said unto my Lord, Sit Thou on
My right hand.” ( [Matt. 22:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#043.md), [Mark
12:36](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#036.md), [Luke
20:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#042)<span id="iv.x-p15.3"></span> ..md)
And in many places, disputing with them, He mentions Moses; and the
Apostle (mentions) the rest of the prophets; for Peter declares, that
all the prophets from Samuel knew Him, and proclaimed beforehand His
coming afar off, when he says, “All the prophets from Samuel and those
that follow after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of
these days.” ( [Acts iii. 24](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#024.md) <span
id="iv.x-p15.4"></span> .) But Jacob and his father, as well as his
grandfather, He both appeared to and talked with, and promised that He
would give them many and great blessings, which also He brought to pass.

<span id="iv.x-p16"></span>“How then,” says one, “did He say Himself,
‘Many prophets have desired to see those things which ye see, and have
not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not
heard them’? ( [Luke x. 24](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#024.md) <span
id="iv.x-p16.1"></span> .) Did they then not share in the knowledge of
Him?” Surely they did; and I will endeavor to make this plain from this
very saying, by which some think that they are deprived of it. “For
many,” He saith, “have desired to see the things which ye see.” So that
they knew that He would come \[to men\] from heaven, and would live and
teach  <span id="fr_180"></span>[181](#fn_180.md) as He lived and taught;
for had they not known, they could have not desired, since no one can
conceive desire for things of which he has no idea; therefore they knew
the Son of Man, and that He would come among men. What then are the
things which they did not hear? What those which they did not know? The
things which ye now see and hear. For if they did hear His voice and did
see Him, it was not in the Flesh, not among men; nor when He was living
so familiarly, and conversing so frankly with them.  <span
id="fr_181"></span>[182](#fn_181.md) And indeed He to show this said not
simply, “to see” “Me”: but what? “the things which ye see”; nor “to
hear” “Me”: but what? “the things which ye hear.”  <span
id="fr_182"></span>[183](#fn_182.md) So that if they did not behold His
coming in the Flesh, still they knew that it would be, and they desired
it, and believed on Him without having seen Him in the Flesh.

<span id="iv.x-p20"></span>When therefore the Greeks bring charges such
as these against us, and say; “What then did Christ in former time, that
He did not look upon the race of men? And for what possible reason did
He come at last to assist in our salvation, after neglecting us so
long?” we will reply, that before this He was in the world, and took
thought for His works, and was known to all who were worthy. But if ye
should say, that, because all did not then know Him, because He was only
known by those noble and excellent persons, therefore He was not
acknowledged; at this rate you will not allow that He is worshiped even
now, since even now all men do not know Him. But as at present no one,
because of those who do not know Him, would refuse credit to those who
do, so as regards former times, we must not doubt that He was known to
many, or rather to all of those noble and admirable persons.

<span id="iv.x-p21"></span> \[2.\] And if any one say, “Why did not all
men give heed to Him? nor all worship Him, but the just only?” I also
will ask, why even now do not all men know him? But why do I speak of
Christ, when not all men knew His Father then, or know Him now? For some
say, that all things are borne along by chance, while others commit the
providence of the universe to devils. Others invent another God besides
Him, and some blasphemously assert, that His is an opposing power,
 <span id="fr_183"></span>[184](#fn_183.md) and think that His laws are the
laws of a wicked dæmon. What then? Shall we say that He is not God
because there <span id="page_31">p. 31</span> <span
id="iv.x-Page_31"></span> are some who say so? And shall we confess Him
to be evil? for there are some who even so blaspheme Him. Away with such
mental wandering, such utter insanity. If we should delineate  <span
id="fr_184"></span>[185](#fn_184.md) doctrines according to the judgment of
madmen, there is nothing to hinder us from being mad ourselves with most
grievous madness. No one will assert, looking to those who have weak
vision, that the sun is injurious to the eyes, but he will say that it
is fitted to give light, drawing his judgments from persons in health.
And no one will call honey bitter, because it seems so to the sense of
the sick. And will any, from the imaginations of men diseased (in mind)
decide that God either is not, or is evil; or that He sometimes indeed
exerts His Providence, sometimes doth not so at all? Who can say that
such men are of sound mind, or deny that they are beside themselves,
delirious, utterly mad?

<span id="iv.x-p24"></span> “The world,” he says, “knew Him not”; but
they of whom the world was not worthy knew Him. And having spoken of
those who knew Him not, he in a short time puts the cause of their
ignorance; for he does not absolutely say, that no one knew Him, but
that “the world knew him not”; that is, those persons who are as it were
nailed to the world alone, and who mind the things of the world. For so
Christ was wont to call them; as when He says, “O Holy  <span
id="fr_185"></span>[186](#fn_185.md) Father, the world hath not known
Thee.” ( [c. xvii. 25](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#025.md) <span
id="iv.x-p25.3"></span> .) The world then was ignorant, not only of Him,
but also of His Father, as we have said; for nothing so darkens  <span
id="fr_186"></span>[187](#fn_186.md) the mind as to be closely attached
 <span id="fr_187"></span>[188](#fn_187.md) to present things.

<span id="iv.x-p28"></span> Knowing therefore this, remove yourselves
from the world, and tear yourselves as much as possible from carnal
things, for the loss which comes to you from these lies not in common
matters, but in what is the chief of goods. For it is not possible for
the man who clings strongly to the things of the present life really
 <span id="fr_188"></span>[189](#fn_188.md) to lay hold on those in heaven,
but he who is earnest about the one must needs lose the other. “Ye
cannot,” He says, “serve God and Mammon” ( [Matt. vi.
24](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#024) <span id="iv.x-p29.2"></span> .md),
for you must hold to the one and hate the other. And this too the very
experience of the things proclaims aloud. Those, for instance, who
deride the lust of money, are especially the persons who love God as
they ought, just as those who respect that sovereignty (of Mammon), are
the men who above all others have the slackest  <span
id="fr_189"></span>[190](#fn_189.md) love for Him. For the soul when made
captive once for all  <span id="fr_190"></span>[191](#fn_190.md) by
covetousness, will not easily or readily refuse doing or saying any of
the things which anger God, as being the slave of another master, and
one who gives all his commands in direct opposition to God. Return then
at length to your sober senses, and rouse yourselves, and calling to
mind whose servants we are, let us love His kingdom only; let us weep,
let us wail for the times past in which we were servants of Mammon; let
us cast off once for all his yoke so intolerable, so heavy, and continue
to bear the light and easy yoke of Christ. For He lays no such commands
upon us as Mammon does. Mammon bids us be enemies to all men, but
Christ, on the contrary, to embrace and to love all. The one having
nailed us  <span id="fr_191"></span>[192](#fn_191.md) to the clay and the
brickmaking, (for gold is this,) allows us not even at night to take
breath a little; the other releases us from this excessive and insensate
care, and bids us gather treasures in heaven, not by injustice towards
others, but by our own righteousness. The one after our many toils and
sufferings is not able to assist us when we are punished in that place
 <span id="fr_192"></span>[193](#fn_192.md) and suffer because of his laws,
nay, he increases the flame; the other, though He command us to give but
a cup of cold water, never allows us to lose our reward and recompense
even for this, but repays us with great abundance. How then is it not
extremest folly to slight a rule so mild, so full of all good things,
and to serve a thankless, ungrateful tyrant, and one who neither in this
world nor in the world to come is able to help those who obey and give
heed to him. Nor is this the only dreadful thing, nor is this only the
penalty, that he does not defend them when they are being punished; but
that besides this, he, as I before said, surrounds those who obey him
with ten thousand evils. For of those who are punished in that place,
one may see that the greater part are punished for this cause, that they
were slaves to money, that they loved gold, and would not assist those
who needed. That we be not in this case, let us scatter, let us give to
the poor, let us deliver our souls from hurtful cares in this world, and
from the vengeance, which because of these things is appointed for us in
that place. Let us store up righteousness in the heavens. Instead of
riches upon earth, let us collect treasures impregnable, treasures which
can accompany us on our journey to heaven, which can assist us in our
peril, and make the Judge propitious at that hour. Whom may we all have
gracious unto us, both now and at that day, and enjoy with much
confidence  <span id="fr_193"></span>[194](#fn_193.md) the good things
prepared in the heavens for those who love Him as they ought, through
the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, with whom, to the
Father and the Holy Ghost, be glory, now and ever, and world without
end. Amen.
