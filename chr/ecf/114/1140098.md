<span id="v.iv-p7"></span> <span class="c15"><span
id="v.iv-p7.1"></span>Argument.</span>

<span id="v.iv-p8"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.iv-p8.1"></span>and Summary of the Epistle.</span>

<span id="v.iv-p9"></span>  \[1.\] <span class="c11"><span
id="v.iv-p9.1"></span>The</span> blessed Paul, writing to the Romans,
says, “Inasmuch then as I am the Apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine
office: if by any means I may provoke to emulation them that are my
flesh”:  <span id="fr_2663"></span>[2664](#fn_2663.md) and again, in
another place, “For He that wrought effectually in Peter to the
apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the
Gentiles.”  <span id="fr_2664"></span>[2665](#fn_2664.md) If therefore he
were the Apostle of the Gentiles, (for also in the Acts, God said to
him, “Depart; for I will send thee far hence unto the Gentiles,”  <span
id="fr_2665"></span>[2666](#fn_2665) .md) what had he to do with the
Hebrews? and why did he also write an Epistle to them?

<span id="v.iv-p13"></span> And especially as besides, they were
ill-disposed towards him, and this is to be seen from many places. For
hear what James says to him, “Thou seest, brother, how many thousands of
Jews there are which believe…and these all have been informed of thee
that thou teachest men to forsake the law.”  <span
id="fr_2666"></span>[2667](#fn_2666.md) And oftentimes he had many
disputings concerning this.

<span id="v.iv-p15"></span> Why therefore, one might ask, as he was so
learned in the law (for he was instructed in the law at the feet of
Gamaliel,  <span id="fr_2667"></span>[2668](#fn_2667.md) and had great zeal
in the matter, and was especially able to confound them in this
respect)—why did not God send him to the Jews? Because on this very
account they were more vehement in their enmity against him. “For they
will not endure thee,”  <span id="fr_2668"></span>[2669](#fn_2668.md) God
says unto him; “But depart far hence to the Gentiles, for they will not
receive thy testimony concerning me.”  <span
id="fr_2669"></span>[2670](#fn_2669.md) Whereupon he says, “Yea, Lord, they
know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on
thee; and when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also was
standing by and consenting unto his death, and kept the raiment of them
that slew him.”  <span id="fr_2670"></span>[2671](#fn_2670.md)

<span id="v.iv-p20"></span> And this he says  <span
id="fr_2671"></span>[2672](#fn_2671.md) is a sign and proof of their not
believing him. For thus it is: when a man goes away from any people,
 <span id="fr_2672"></span>[2673](#fn_2672.md) if he be one of the least
and of those who are nothing worth, he does not much vex those from whom
he went; but if he be among the distinguished and earnest partisans and
those who care for these things, he exceedingly grieves and vexes them
beyond measure, in that  <span id="fr_2673"></span>[2674](#fn_2673.md) he
especially overthrows their system with the multitude.

<span id="v.iv-p24"></span> And besides this, there was something else.
 <span id="fr_2674"></span>[2675](#fn_2674.md) What now might this be? That
they who were about Peter were also with Christ, and saw signs <span
id="page_364">p. 364</span> <span id="v.iv-Page_364"></span> and
wonders; but he \[Paul\] having had the benefit of none of these, but
being with Jews, suddenly deserted and became one of them. This
especially promoted our cause. For while they indeed, seemed to testify
even from gratitude, and one might have said that they bore witness to
those things in love for their Master; he, on the other hand, who
testifies to the resurrection, this man was rather one who heard a voice
only. For this cause thou seest them waging war passionately with him,
and doing all things for this purpose, that they might slay him, and
raising seditions.  <span id="fr_2675"></span>[2676](#fn_2675.md)

<span id="v.iv-p27"></span> The unbelievers, then, were hostile to him
for this reason; but why were the believers? Because in preaching to the
Gentiles he was constrained to preach Christianity purely; and if haply
even in Judæa he were found \[doing so\], he cared not. For Peter and
they that were with him, because they preached in Jerusalem, when there
was great fierceness, of necessity enjoined the observance of the law;
but this man was quite at liberty. The \[converts\] too from the
Gentiles were more than the Jews because they were without.  <span
id="fr_2676"></span>[2677](#fn_2676.md) And this  <span
id="fr_2677"></span>[2678](#fn_2677.md) enfeebled the law, and they had no
such great reverence for it, although  <span
id="fr_2678"></span>[2679](#fn_2678.md) he preached all things purely.
Doubtless in this matter they think to shame him by numbers, saying,
“Thou seest, brother, how many ten thousands of Jews there are which
 <span id="fr_2679"></span>[2680](#fn_2679.md) are come together.”  <span
id="fr_2680"></span>[2681](#fn_2680.md) On this account they hated him and
turned away from him, because “They are informed of thee, he says, that
thou teachest men to forsake the law.”  <span
id="fr_2681"></span>[2682](#fn_2681.md)

<span id="v.iv-p34"></span> \[2.\] Why, then, not being a teacher of the
Jews, does he send an Epistle to them? And where were those to whom he
sent it? It seems to me in Jerusalem and Palestine. How then does he
send them an Epistle? Just as he baptized, though he was not commanded
to baptize. For, he says, “I was not sent to baptize”:  <span
id="fr_2682"></span>[2683](#fn_2682.md) not, however, that he was
forbidden, but he does it as a subordinate matter. And how could he fail
to write to those, for whom he was willing even to become accursed?
 <span id="fr_2683"></span>[2684](#fn_2683.md) Accordingly he said,  <span
id="fr_2684"></span>[2685](#fn_2684.md) “Know ye that our brother Timothy
is set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you.”
 <span id="fr_2685"></span>[2686](#fn_2685.md)

<span id="v.iv-p39"></span> For as yet he was not arrested. Two years
then he passed bound, in Rome; then he was set free; then, having gone
into Spain, he saw Jews  <span id="fr_2686"></span>[2687](#fn_2686.md) also
in like manner; and then he returned to Rome, where also he was slain by
Nero. The Epistle to Timothy then was later  <span
id="fr_2687"></span>[2688](#fn_2687.md) than this Epistle. For there he
says, “For I am now ready to be offered”  <span
id="fr_2688"></span>[2689](#fn_2688.md) ; there also he says, “In my first
answer no man stood with me.”  <span
id="fr_2689"></span>[2690](#fn_2689.md) In many places they \[the Hebrew
Christians\] had to contend  <span id="fr_2690"></span>[2691](#fn_2690.md)
with persecution, as also he says, writing to the Thessalonians, “Ye
became followers of the churches of Judæa”:  <span
id="fr_2691"></span>[2692](#fn_2691.md) and writing to these very persons
he says, “Ye took joyfully the spoiling of your goods.”  <span
id="fr_2692"></span>[2693](#fn_2692.md) Dost thou see them contending? And
if men had thus treated the Apostles, not only in Judæa, but also
wherever they were among the Gentiles, what would they not have done to
the believers? On this account, thou seest, he was very careful for
them. For when he says, “I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the
saints”;  <span id="fr_2693"></span>[2694](#fn_2693.md) and again, when he
exhorts the Corinthians to beneficence, and says that the Macedonians
had already made their contribution,  <span
id="fr_2694"></span>[2695](#fn_2694.md) and says, “If it be meet that I go
also,”  <span id="fr_2695"></span>[2696](#fn_2695.md) —he means this. And
when he says, “Only that we should remember the poor; the same which I
also was forward to do,”  <span id="fr_2696"></span>[2697](#fn_2696.md) —he
declares this. And when he says, “They gave to me and Barnabas the right
hands of fellowship; that we should go unto the heathen, and they unto
the circumcision,”  <span id="fr_2697"></span>[2698](#fn_2697.md) —he
declares this.

<span id="v.iv-p52"></span> But this was  <span
id="fr_2698"></span>[2699](#fn_2698.md) not for the sake of the poor who
were there, but that by this we might be partakers in the beneficence.
For not as the preaching did we apportion the care for the poor to each
other (we indeed to the Gentiles, but they to the circumcision). And
everywhere thou seest him using great care for them: as was reasonable.

<span id="v.iv-p54"></span> Among the other nations indeed, when there
were both Jews and Greeks, such was not the case; but then, while they
still seemed to have authority and independence and to order many things
by their own laws, the government not being yet established nor brought
perfectly under the Romans, they naturally exercised great tyranny. For
if in other cities, as in Corinth, they beat the Ruler of the synagogue
before the Deputy’s judgment seat, and Gallio “cared for none of these
things,”  <span id="fr_2699"></span>[2700](#fn_2699.md) but it was not so
in <span id="page_365">p. 365</span> <span id="v.iv-Page_365"></span>
Judæa.  <span id="fr_2700"></span>[2701](#fn_2700.md) Thou seest indeed,
that while in other cities they bring them to the magistrates, and need
help from them and from the Gentiles, here they took no thought of this,
but assemble a Sanhedrim themselves and slay whom they please. Thus in
fact they put Stephen to death, thus they beat the Apostles, not taking
them before rulers. Thus also they were about to put Paul to death, had
not the chief captain thrown himself  <span
id="fr_2701"></span>[2702](#fn_2701.md) \[upon them\]. For this took place
while the priests, while the temple, while the ritual, the sacrifices
were yet standing. Look indeed at Paul himself being tried before the
High Priest, and saying,“ I wist not that he was the High Priest,”
 <span id="fr_2702"></span>[2703](#fn_2702.md) and this in the presence of
the Ruler.  <span id="fr_2703"></span>[2704](#fn_2703.md) For they had then
great power. Consider then what things they were likely to suffer who
dwelt in Jerusalem and Judæa.

<span id="v.iv-p60"></span> \[3.\] He then who prays to become accursed
for those who were not yet believers, and who so ministers to the
faithful, as to journey himself, if need be, and who everywhere took
great care of them;—let us not wonder if he encourage and comfort them
by letters also, and if he set them upright when tottering and fallen.
For in a word, they were worn down  <span
id="fr_2704"></span>[2705](#fn_2704.md) and despairing on account of their
manifold afflictions. And this he shows near the end, saying, “Wherefore
lift up the hands that hang down, and the feeble knees”;  <span
id="fr_2705"></span>[2706](#fn_2705.md) and again, “Yet a little while, he
that shall come will come, and will not tarry”;  <span
id="fr_2706"></span>[2707](#fn_2706.md) and again, “If ye be without
chastisement,…then are ye bastards and not sons.”  <span
id="fr_2707"></span>[2708](#fn_2707.md)

<span id="v.iv-p65"></span>For since they were Jews and learned from the
fathers that they must expect both their good and their evil immediately
and must live accordingly, but then \[when the Gospel came\] the
opposite was \[taught\]—their good things being in hope and after death,
their evils in hand, though they had patiently endured much, it was
likely that many would be fainthearted;—hereon he discourses.

<span id="v.iv-p66"></span> But we will unfold these things at a fit
opportunity. At present: he of necessity wrote to those for whom he
cared so greatly. For while the reason why he was not sent to them is
plain, yet he was not forbidden to write. And that they were becoming
fainthearted he shows when he says, “Lift up the hands which hang down,
and the feeble knees, and make straight paths”  <span
id="fr_2708"></span>[2709](#fn_2708.md) and again, “God is not unrighteous
to forget your work and love.”  <span
id="fr_2709"></span>[2710](#fn_2709.md) For the soul overtaken by many
trials, was turned aside even from the faith.  <span
id="fr_2710"></span>[2711](#fn_2710.md) Therefore he exhorts them to “Give
heed to the things which they have heard, and that there should not be
an evil heart of unbelief.”  <span id="fr_2711"></span>[2712](#fn_2711.md)
On this account also, in this Epistle, especially, he argues at length
concerning faith, and after much \[reasoning\] shows at the end that to
them \[of old\] also He promised good things in hand, and yet gave
nothing.

<span id="v.iv-p71"></span>And besides these things, he establishes two
points that they might not think themselves forsaken: the one, that they
should bear nobly whatever befalls them; the other, that they should
look assuredly for their recompense. For truly He will not overlook
those with Abel and the line of unrewarded righteous following him.

<span id="v.iv-p72"></span> And he draws comfort in three ways: first,
from the things which Christ suffered: as He Himself says, “The servant
is not greater than his Lord.”  <span
id="fr_2712"></span>[2713](#fn_2712.md) Next, from the good things laid up
for the believers. Thirdly, from the evils; and this point he enforces
not only from the things to come (which would be less persuasive), but
also from the past and from what had befallen their fathers. Christ also
does the same, at one time saying, “The servant is not greater than his
Lord”;  <span id="fr_2713"></span>[2714](#fn_2713.md) and again, “There are
many mansions with the Father”;  <span
id="fr_2714"></span>[2715](#fn_2714.md) and He denounces innumerable woes
on the unbelievers.

<span id="v.iv-p76"></span> But he speaks much of both the New and the
Old Covenant; for this was useful to him for the proof of the
Resurrection. Lest they should disbelieve that \[Christ\] rose on
account of the things which He suffered, he confirms it from the
Prophets, and shows that not the Jewish, but ours are the sacred
\[institutions\]. For the temple yet stood and the sacrificial rites;
therefore he says, “Let us go forth therefore without, bearing His
reproach.”  <span id="fr_2715"></span>[2716](#fn_2715.md) But this also was
made an argument against him: “If these things are a shadow, if these
things are an image, how is it that they have not passed away or given
place when the truth was manifested, but these things still flourish?”
This also he quietly intimates shall happen, and that at a time close at
hand.

<span id="v.iv-p78"></span> Moreover, he makes it plain that they had
been a long time in the faith and in afflictions, saying, “When for the
time ye ought to be teachers,”  <span
id="fr_2716"></span>[2717](#fn_2716.md) and, “Lest there be in any of you
an evil heart of unbelief,”  <span id="fr_2717"></span>[2718](#fn_2717.md)
and ye became “Followers of them who through patience inherit the
promises.”  <span id="fr_2718"></span>[2719](#fn_2718.md)
