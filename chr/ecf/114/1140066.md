<span id="iv.lxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c15"><span
id="iv.lxiii-p1.1"></span>Homily LXI.</span>

<span id="iv.lxiii-p2"></span> <span id="iv.lxiii-p2.1"></span> <span
class="c1"><span id="iv.lxiii-p2.2"></span>[John x.
22-24](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#022.md)<span

<span id="iv.lxiii-p3"></span>“And it was at Jerusalem, the Feast of the
dedication, and it was winter. And Jesus walked in the temple in
Solomon’s porch. Then came the Jews round about Him, and said unto Him,
How long dost thou make us to doubt?”

<span id="iv.lxiii-p4"></span> \[1.\] <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.lxiii-p4.1"></span>Every</span> virtue is a good thing, but most
of all gentleness and meekness. This showeth us men; this maketh us to
differ from wild beasts; this fitteth us to vie with Angels. Wherefore
Christ continually expendeth many words about this virtue, bidding us be
meek and gentle. Nor doth He merely expend words about it, but also
teacheth it by His actions; at one time buffeted and bearing it, at
another reproached and plotted against; yet again coming to those who
plotted against Him. For those men who had called Him a demoniac, and a
Samaritan and who had often desired to kill Him, and had cast stones at
Him, the same surrounded and asked Him, “Art thou the Christ?” Yet not
even in this case did He reject them after so many and so great plots
against Him, but answered them with great gentleness.

<span id="iv.lxiii-p5"></span>But it is necessary rather to enquire into
the whole passage from the beginning.

<span id="iv.lxiii-p6"></span> “It was,” It saith, “at Jerusalem, the
Feast of the dedication, and it was winter.” This feast was a great and
national one. For they celebrated with great zeal the day on which the
Temple was rebuilt, on their return from their long captivity in Persia.
At this feast Christ also was present, for henceforth He continually
abode in Judæa, because the Passion was nigh.  <span
id="fr_1636"></span>[1637](#fn_1636.md) “Then came the Jews round about
Him, and said, How long dost thou make us to doubt?”

<span id="iv.lxiii-p8"></span>“If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly.”

<span id="iv.lxiii-p9"></span> He did not reply, “What enquire ye  <span
id="fr_1637"></span>[1638](#fn_1637.md) of Me? Often have ye called Me
demoniac, madman, and Samaritan, and have deemed me an enemy of God, and
a deceiver, and ye said but now, Thou bearest witness of thyself, thy
witness is not true; how is it then that ye seek and desire to learn
from Me, whose witness ye reject?” But He said nothing of the kind,
although He knew that the intention with which they made the enquiry was
evil. For their surrounding Him and saying, “How long dost thou make us
to doubt?” seemed to proceed from a certain longing and desire of
learning, but the intention with which they asked the question was
corrupt and deceitful. For since His works admitted not of their slander
and insolence, while they might attack His sayings by finding out in
them a sense other than that in which they were spoken, they continually
proposed questions, desiring to silence Him by means of His sayings; and
when they could find no fault with His works, they wished to find a
handle in His words. Therefore they said, “Tell us”; yet He had often
told them. For He said to the woman of Samaria, “I Am that speak unto
thee” ( [John 4.26](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#026.md)<span
id="iv.lxiii-p10.3"></span> ); and to the blind man, “Thou hast both
seen Him, and it is He that <span id="page_221">p. 221</span> <span
id="iv.lxiii-Page_221"></span> talketh with thee.” ( [John
9.37](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#037.md)<span id="iv.lxiii-p10.4"></span>
.) And He had told them also, if not in the same, at least in other
words. And indeed, had they been wise, and had they desired to enquire
aright, it remained for them to confess Him by words, since by works He
had often proved the point in question. But now observe their perverse
and disputations temper. When He addresseth them, and instructeth them
by His words, they say, “What sign showest thou us?” ( [John
6.30](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#030.md)<span id="iv.lxiii-p10.5"></span>
.) But when He giveth them proofs by His works, they say to Him, “Art
thou the Christ? Tell us plainly”; when the works cry aloud, they seek
words, and when the words teach, then they betake themselves to works,
ever setting themselves to the contrary. But that they enquired not for
the sake of learning, the end showed. For Him whom they deemed to be so
worthy of credit, as to receive His witness of Himself, when He had
spoken a few words they straightway stoned; so that their very
surrounding and pressing upon Him was done with ill intent.

<span id="iv.lxiii-p11"></span>And the mode of questioning was full of
much hatred. “Tell us plainly, Art thou the Christ?” Yet He spake all
things openly, being ever present at their feasts, and in secret He said
nothing; but they brought forward words of deceit, “How long dost thou
make us to doubt?” in order that having drawn Him out, they might again
find some handle against Him. For that in every case they questioned Him
not in order to learn, but to find fault with His words, is clear, not
from this passage only, but from many others also. Since when they came
to Him and asked, “Is it lawful to give tribute unto Cæsar or not?” (
[Matt. xxii. 17](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#017.md) <span
id="iv.lxiii-p11.1"></span> ), when they spake about putting away a wife
( [Matt. xix. 3](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#003.md) <span
id="iv.lxiii-p11.2"></span> ), when they enquired about her who, they
said, had had seven husbands ( [Matt. xxii.
23](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#023.md) <span id="iv.lxiii-p11.3"></span>
), they were convicted of bringing their questions to Him, not from
desire of learning, but from an evil intention. But there He rebuked
them, saying, “Why tempt ye Me, ye hypocrites?” showing that He knew
their secret thoughts, while here He said nothing of the kind; teaching
us not always to rebuke those who plot against us, but to bear many
things with meekness and gentleness.

<span id="iv.lxiii-p12"></span>Since then it was a sign of folly, when
the works proclaimed Him aloud, to seek the witness of words, hear how
He answereth them, at once hinting to them that they made these
enquiries superfluously, and not for the sake of learning, and at the
same time showing that He uttered a voice plainer than that by words,
namely, that by works.

<span id="iv.lxiii-p13"></span> [John
10.25](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#025.md)<span id="iv.lxiii-p13.1"></span>
. “I told you often,”  <span id="fr_1638"></span>[1639](#fn_1638.md) He
saith, “and ye believe not: the works that I do in My Father’s Name,
they are they that bear witness of Me.”

<span id="iv.lxiii-p15"></span> \[2.\] A remark which the more tolerable
among them continually made to one another; “A man that is a sinner
cannot  <span id="fr_1639"></span>[1640](#fn_1639.md) do such miracles.”
And again, “A devil cannot open the eyes of the blind”: and, “No man can
do such miracles except God be with him.” ( [John
3.2](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#002.md)<span id="iv.lxiii-p16.3"></span>
.) And beholding the miracles that He did, they said, “Is not this the
Christ?” Others said, “When Christ cometh, will He do greater miracles
than those which this Man hath done?” ( [John
7.31](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#031.md)<span id="iv.lxiii-p16.4"></span>
.) And these very persons as many as then desired to believe on Him,
saying, “What sign showest thou us, that we may see, and believe thee?”
( [John 6.30](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#030.md)<span
id="iv.lxiii-p16.5"></span> .) When then they who had not been persuaded
by such great works, pretended that they should be persuaded by a bare
word, He rebuketh their wickedness, saying, “If ye believe not My works,
how will ye believe My words? so that your questioning is superfluous.”

<span id="iv.lxiii-p17"></span> [John
10.26](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#026.md)<span id="iv.lxiii-p17.1"></span>
. “But,” He saith, “I told you, and ye  <span
id="fr_1640"></span>[1641](#fn_1640.md) believe not, because ye are not of
My sheep.”  <span id="fr_1641"></span>[1642](#fn_1641.md)

<span id="iv.lxiii-p20"></span>“For I on My part have fulfilled all that
it behooved a Shepherd to do, and if ye follow Me not, it is not because
I am not a Shepherd, but because ye are not My sheep.”

<span id="iv.lxiii-p21"></span> [John
10.27-30](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#027.md)<span
id="iv.lxiii-p21.1"></span> . “For My sheep hear My voice,  <span
id="fr_1642"></span>[1643](#fn_1642.md) and follow Me; and I give unto them
eternal life  <span id="fr_1643"></span>[1644](#fn_1643.md) ; neither can
 <span id="fr_1644"></span>[1645](#fn_1644.md) any man pluck them out of My
hand. The Father,  <span id="fr_1645"></span>[1646](#fn_1645.md) which gave
them Me, is greater than all, and no man is able to pluck them out of My
Father’s hand. I and the Father are One.”

<span id="iv.lxiii-p26"></span>Observe how in renouncing He exciteth
them to follow Him. “Ye hear Me not,” He saith, “for neither are ye
sheep, but they who follow, these are of the flock.” This He said, that
they might strive to become sheep. Then by mentioning what they should
obtain, He maketh these men jealous, so as to rouse them, and cause them
to desire such things.

<span id="iv.lxiii-p27"></span>“What then? Is it through the power of
the Father that no man plucketh them away, and hast thou no strength,
but art too weak to guard them?” By no means. And in order that thou
mayest learn that the expression, “The Father which gave them to Me,” is
used on their account, that they might not again call Him an enemy of
God, therefore, after asserting that, “No man plucketh them out of My
hand,” He proceedeth to show, that His hand and the Father’s is One.
Since had not this been so, it would have been natural for Him to say,
“The Father which gave them to Me is greater than all, and no man can
<span id="page_222">p. 222</span> <span id="iv.lxiii-Page_222"></span>
pluck them out of My hand.” But He said not so, but, “out of My Father’s
hand.” Then that thou mayest not suppose that He indeed is weak, but
that the sheep are in safety through the power of the Father, He addeth,
“I and the Father are One.” As though He had said “I did not assert that
on account of the Father no man plucketh them away, as though I were too
weak to keep the sheep. For I and the Father are One.” Speaking here
with reference to Power, for concerning this was all His discourse; and
if the power  <span id="fr_1646"></span>[1647](#fn_1646.md) be the same, it
is clear that the Essence is also. And when the Jews used ten thousand
means, plotting and casting men out of their synagogues, He telleth them
that all their contrivances are useless and vain; “For the sheep are in
My Father’s hand”; as the Prophet saith, “Upon My hand I have pictured
thy walls.” ( [Isa. xlix. 16](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#016.md) <span
id="iv.lxiii-p28.2"></span> .) Then to show that the hand is One, He
sometimes saith that it is His own, sometimes the Father’s.  But when
thou hearest the word “hand,” do not understand anything material, but
the power, the authority. Again, if it was on this account that no one
could pluck away the sheep, because the Father gave Him power, it would
have been superfluous to say what follows, “I and the Father are One.”
Since were He inferior to Him, this would have been a very daring
saying, for it declares nothing else than an equality of power; of which
the Jews were conscious, and took up stones to cast at Him. ( [John
10.31](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#031.md)<span id="iv.lxiii-p28.3"></span>
.) Yet not even so did He remove this opinion and suspicion; though if
their suspicion were erroneous, He ought to have set them right, and to
have said, “Wherefore do ye these things? I spake not thus to testify
that my power and the Father’s are equal”; but now He doth quite the
contrary, and confirmeth their suspicion, and clencheth it, and that too
when they were exasperated. For He maketh no excuse for what had been
said, as though it had been said ill, but rebuketh them for not
entertaining a right opinion concerning Him. For when they said,

<span id="iv.lxiii-p29"></span> [John
10.33-36](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#033.md)<span
id="iv.lxiii-p29.1"></span> .  <span
id="fr_1647"></span>[1648](#fn_1647.md) “For a good work we stone thee not,
but for blasphemy; and because that thou being a man makest thyself
God”; hear His answer;  <span id="fr_1648"></span>[1649](#fn_1648.md) “If
the Scripture called  <span id="fr_1649"></span>[1650](#fn_1649.md) them
gods unto whom the word of God came,  <span
id="fr_1650"></span>[1651](#fn_1650.md) how say ye that I blaspheme,
because I said, I am the Son of God?”

<span id="iv.lxiii-p34"></span>What He saith is of this kind: “If those
who have received this honor by grace, are not found fault with for
calling themselves gods, how can He who hath this by nature deserve to
be rebuked?” Yet He spake not so, but proved it at a later time, having
first relaxed and yielded somewhat in His discourse, and said, “Whom the
Father hath sanctified and sent.” And when He had softened their anger,
He bringeth forward the plain assertion. For a while, that His speech
might be received, He spoke in a humbler strain, but afterwards He
raised it higher, saying,

<span id="iv.lxiii-p35"></span> [John
10:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#037.md),
[38](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#038.md)<span id="iv.lxiii-p35.1"></span> .
“If I do not the works of My Father, believe Me not; but if I do, though
ye believe not Me, believe the works.”

<span id="iv.lxiii-p36"></span>Seest thou how He proveth what I said,
that He is in nothing inferior to the Father, but in every way equal to
Him? For since it was impossible to see His Essence, from the equality
and sameness of the works He affordeth a proof of unvaryingness as to
Power. And what, tell me, shall we believe?

<span id="iv.lxiii-p37"></span> \[3.\] “That I am in the Father, and the
Father in Me.”  <span id="fr_1651"></span>[1652](#fn_1651.md)

<span id="iv.lxiii-p39"></span> “For I am nothing other than what the
Father is, yet still Son; He nothing other than what I am, yet still
Father. And if any man know Me, he knoweth the Father, and if he knoweth
the Father,  <span id="fr_1652"></span>[1653](#fn_1652.md) he hath learnt
also the Son.” Now were the power inferior, then also what relateth to
the knowledge would be false, for it is not possible to become
acquainted with one substance or power by means of another.

<span id="iv.lxiii-p41"></span> [John
10.39-41](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#039.md)<span
id="iv.lxiii-p41.1"></span> . “Therefore they sought again to take Him,
but He escaped out of their hands, and went away again beyond Jordan,
into the place where John at first baptized.  <span
id="fr_1653"></span>[1654](#fn_1653.md) And many resorted unto Him, and
said, John did no miracle, but all things that John spake of this man
were true.”

<span id="iv.lxiii-p43"></span>When He hath uttered anything great and
sublime, He quickly retireth, giving way to their anger, so that the
passion may abate and cease through His absence. And thus He acted at
that time. But wherefore doth the Evangelist mention the place? That
thou mayest learn that He went there to remind them of the things there
done and said by John, and of his testimony; at least when they came
there, they straightway remembered John. Wherefore also they said, “John
indeed did no miracle,” since how did it follow that they should add
this, unless the place had brought the Baptist to their memory, and they
had come to remember his testimony. And observe how they form
incontrovertible syllogisms. “John indeed did no <span id="page_223">p.
223</span> <span id="iv.lxiii-Page_223"></span> miracle,” “but this man
doth,” saith some one; “hence therefore his superiority is shown. If
therefore men  <span id="fr_1654"></span>[1655](#fn_1654.md) believed him
who did no miracles, much more must they believe this man.” Then, since
it was John who bore the witness, lest his having done no miracle might
seem to prove him unworthy of being a witness,  <span
id="fr_1655"></span>[1656](#fn_1655.md) they added, “Yet if he did no
miracle, still he spake all things truly concerning this man”; no longer
proving Christ to be trustworthy by means of John, but John to be so by
what Christ had done.

<span id="iv.lxiii-p46"></span> [John
10.42](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#042.md)<span id="iv.lxiii-p46.1"></span>
. “Many therefore believed on Him.”  <span
id="fr_1656"></span>[1657](#fn_1656.md) There were many things that
attracted them. They remembered the words which John had spoken, calling
Christ “mightier than himself,” and “light,” and “life,” and “truth,”
and all the rest. They remembered the Voice which came down from heaven,
and the Spirit which appeared in the shape of a dove, and pointed Him
out to all; and with this they recollected the demonstration afforded by
the miracles, looking to which they were for the future established. 
“For,” saith some one, “if it was right that we should believe John,
much more ought we to believe this man; if him without miracles, much
more this man, who besides the testimony of John, hath also the proof
 <span id="fr_1657"></span>[1658](#fn_1657.md) from miracles.” Seest thou
how much the abiding in this place, and the being freed from the
presence of evil men, profited them? wherefore Jesus continually leadeth
and draweth them away from the company of those persons; as also He
seemeth to have done under the old Covenant, forming and ordering the
Jews in all points, in the desert, at a distance from the Egyptians.

<span id="iv.lxiii-p49"></span> And this He now adviseth us also to do,
bidding us avoid public places, and tumults, and disturbances, and pray
peacefully in the chamber. For the vessel which is free from confusion,
sails with a fair wind, and the soul which is separated from worldly
matters rests in harbor. Wherefore women ought to have more true wisdom
than men, because they are for the most part riveted to keeping at home.
So, for instance, Jacob was a plain  <span
id="fr_1658"></span>[1659](#fn_1658.md) man, because he dwelt at home, and
was free from the bustle of public life; for not without a cause hath
Scripture put this, when It saith, “dwelling in a house.” ( [Gen. xxv.
27](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#027.md) <span id="iv.lxiii-p50.3"></span>
.) “But,” saith some woman, “even in a house there is great confusion.”
Yes, when thou wilt have it so, and bringest about thyself a crowd of
cares. For the man who spends his time in the midst of the market-places
and courts of justice is overwhelmed, as if by waves, by external
troubles; but the women who sits in her house as in some school of true
wisdom, and collects her thoughts within herself, will be enabled to
apply herself to prayers, and readings, and other heavenly wisdom. And
as they who dwell in deserts have none to disturb them, so she being
continually within can enjoy a perpetual calm. Nor even if at any time
she need to go forth, is there then any cause for confusion. For the
necessary occasions for a women to leave her house are, either for the
purpose of coming hither, or when the body need to be cleansed in the
bath; but for the most part she sits at home, and it is possible for her
both to be herself truly wise, and receiving her husband when agitated
to calm and compose him, to abate the excess and fierceness of his
thoughts, and so to send him forth again, having put off all the
mischiefs which he collected from the market-place, and carrying with
him whatever good he learnt at home. For nothing, nothing is more
powerful than a pious and sensible women to bring a man into proper
order, and to mould his soul as she will. For he will not endure
friends, or teachers, or rulers, as he will his partner advising and
counseling him, since the advice carries even some pleasure with it,
because she who gives the counsel is greatly loved. I could tell of many
hard and disobedient men who have been softened in this way. For she who
shares his table, his bed, and his embraces, his words and secrets, his
comings in and goings out, and many other things, who is entirely given
up  <span id="fr_1659"></span>[1660](#fn_1659.md) and joined to him, as it
is likely that a body would be joined to a head, if she happen to be
discreet and well attuned, will go beyond and excel all others in the
management of her husband.

<span id="iv.lxiii-p52"></span>\[4.\] Wherefore I exhort women to make
this their employment, and to give fitting counsel. For as they have
great power for good, so have they also for evil. A women destroyed
Absalom, a woman destroyed Amnon, a woman was like to have destroyed
Job, a woman rescued Nabal from the slaughter. Women have preserved
whole nations; for Deborah and Judith exhibited successes worthy of men;
so also do ten thousand other women. Wherefore Paul saith, “For what
knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband?” ( [1 Cor.
vii. 16](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#016.md) <span
id="iv.lxiii-p52.1"></span> .) And in those times we see Persis and Mary
and Priscilla taking part in the labors  <span
id="fr_1660"></span>[1661](#fn_1660.md) of the Apostles ( [Rom.
16](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#000.md) <span id="iv.lxiii-p53.5"></span>
); whom we  <span id="fr_1661"></span>[1662](#fn_1661.md) also needs must
imitate, and not by words only, but also by actions, bring into order
him that dwelleth with us. But how shall we instruct him by our actions?
When he sees that thou art not evilly disposed, not fond of expense or
ornament, not demanding extravagant supplies of money, but content with
what <span id="page_224">p. 224</span> <span
id="iv.lxiii-Page_224"></span> thou hast, then will he endure thee
counseling him. But if thou art wise in word, and in actions doest the
contrary, he will condemn thee for very foolish talking. But when
together with words thou affordest him also instruction by thy works,
then will he admit thee and obey thee the more readily; as when thou
desirest not gold, nor pearls, nor costly clothing, but instead of
these, modesty, sobriety, kindness; when thou exhibitest these virtues
on thy part and requirest them on his. For if thou must needs do
somewhat to please thy husband, thou shouldest adorn thy soul, not adorn
and so spoil thy person. The gold which thou puttest about thee will not
make thee so lovely and desirable to him, as modesty and kindness
towards himself, and a readiness to die for thy partner; these things
most subdue men. Indeed, that splendor of apparel even displeases him,
as straitening his means, and causing him much expense and care; but
those things which I have named will rivet a husband to a wife; for
kindness and friendship and love cause no cares, give rise to no
expense, but quite the contrary. That outward adornment becomes palling
by use, but that of the soul blooms day by day, and kindles a stronger
flame. So that if thou wouldest please thy husband, adorn thy soul with
modesty, piety, and management of the house. These things both subdue
him more, and never cease. Age destroys not this adornment, sickness
wastes it not. The adornment of the body length of time is wont to undo,
sickness and many other things to waste, but what relates to the soul is
above all this. That adornment causes envy, and kindles jealousy, but
this is pure from disease, and free from all vainglory. Thus will
matters at home be easier, and your income without trouble, when the
gold is not laid on about your body or encircling your arms, but passes
on  <span id="fr_1662"></span>[1663](#fn_1662.md) to necessary uses, such
as the feeding of servants, the necessary care of children, and other
useful purposes. But if this be not the case, if the (wife’s) face be
covered with ornaments, while the (husband’s) heart is pressed by
anxiety, what profit, what kind of advantage is there? The one being
grieved allows not the marvelous beauty of the other to be seen. For ye
know, ye know that though a man see the most beautiful of all women, he
cannot feel pleasure at the sight while his soul is sorrowful, because
in order to feel pleasure a man must first rejoice and be glad. And when
all his gold is heaped together to adorn a woman’s body, while there is
distress in his dwelling, her partner can have no pleasure. So that if
we desire to be agreeable to our husbands, let us give them pleasure;
and we shall give them pleasure, if we remove our ornaments and
fineries. For all these things at the actual time of marriage appear to
afford some delight, but this afterwards fades by time. Since if when
the heaven is so beautiful, and the sun, to which thou canst not name
any body that is equal, so bright, we admire them less from habitually
seeing them, how shall we admire a body tricked out with gewgaws? These
things I say, desiring that you should be adorned with that wholesome
adornment which Paul enjoined; “Not with gold, or pearls, or costly
array; but (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works.”
( [1 Tim. 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#009.md),
[10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#010.md)<span id="iv.lxiii-p55.3"></span>
.) But dost thou wish to please strangers, and to be praised by them?
Then assuredly this is not the desire of a modest woman. However, if
thou wishest it, by doing as I have said, thou wilt have strangers also
to love thee much, and to praise thy modesty. For the woman who adorns
her person no virtuous and sober person will praise, but the intemperate
and lascivious; nay, rather neither will these praise her, but will even
speak vilely of her, having their eyes inflamed by the wantonness
displayed about her; but the other all will approve, both the one sort
and the other, because they receive no harm from her, but even
instruction in heavenly wisdom. And great shall be her praise from men,
and great her reward with God. After such adornment then let us strive,
that we may live here without fear, and may obtain the blessings which
are to come; which may we all obtain through the grace and
loving-kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory for ever and
ever. Amen.
