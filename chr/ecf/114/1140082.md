<span id="iv.lxxix-p3"></span>“These things have I spoken unto you, that
My joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full. This is My
commandment, that ye love one another, as I have loved you.”

<span id="iv.lxxix-p4"></span> \[1.\] <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.lxxix-p4.1"></span>All</span> things good then have their reward,
when they arrive at their proper end, but if they be cut off midway,
shipwreck ensues. And as a vessel of immense burden, if it reach not the
harbor in time, but founder in the midst of the sea, gains nothing from
the length of the voyage, but even makes the calamity greater, in
proportion as it has endured more toils; so are those souls which fall
back when near the end of their labors, and faint in the midst of the
struggle. Wherefore Paul said, that glory, and honor, and peace, should
meet those who ran their course with patient continuance in well-doing.
A thing which Christ now effecteth in the case of the <span
id="page_280">p. 280</span> <span id="iv.lxxix-Page_280"></span>
disciples. ( [Rom. ii. 7](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#007.md) <span
id="iv.lxxix-p4.2"></span> .) For since He had accepted them, and they
rejoiced in Him, and then the sudden coming of the Passion and His sad
words were likely to cut short their pleasure; after having conversed
with them sufficiently to soothe them, He addeth, “These things have I
spoken unto you, that My joy might remain in you, and that your joy
might be fulfilled”; that is, “that ye might not be separated from Me,
that ye might not cut short your course. Ye were rejoicing in Me, and ye
were rejoicing exceedingly, but despondency hath fallen upon you. This
then I remove, that joy may come at the last, showing that your present
circumstances are fit cause, not for pain, but for pleasure. I saw you
offended; I despised you not; I said not, ‘Why do ye not continue
noble?’ But I spake to you words which brought comfort with them. And so
I wish ever to keep you in the same love. Ye have heard concerning a
kingdom, ye rejoiced. In order therefore that your joy might be
fulfilled, I have spoken these things unto you.” But “this is the
commandment, that ye love one another as I have loved you.” Seest thou
that the love of God is intertwined with our own, and connected like a
sort of chain? Wherefore it sometimes saith that there are two
commandments, sometimes only one.  For it is not possible that the man
who hath taken hold on the first should not possess the second also. For
at one time He said, “On this the Law and the Prophets hang”  <span
id="fr_2196"></span>[2197](#fn_2196.md) ( [Matt. xxii.
40](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#040) <span id="iv.lxxix-p5.3"></span> .md);
and at another, “Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye
even so to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets.” ( [Matt. vii.
12](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#012) <span id="iv.lxxix-p5.4"></span> ..md)
And, “Love is the fulfilling of the Law.” ( [Rom. xiii.
10](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#010) <span id="iv.lxxix-p5.5"></span> ..md)
Which He saith also here; for if to abide proceeds from love, and love
from the keeping of the commandments, and the commandment is that we
love one another, then the abiding in God proceeds from love towards
each other. And He doth not simply speak of love, but declareth also the
manner, “As I have loved you.” Again He showeth, that His very departure
was not of hatred but of love. “So that I ought rather to be admired on
this account, for I lay down My life for you.”  <span
id="fr_2197"></span>[2198](#fn_2197.md) Yet nowhere doth He say this in
these words, but in a former place, by sketching the best shepherd, and
here by exhorting them, and by showing the greatness of His love, and
Himself, who He is. But wherefore doth He everywhere exalt love? Because
this is the mark of the disciples, this the bond of virtue.  <span
id="fr_2198"></span>[2199](#fn_2198.md) On this account Paul saith such
great things of it, as being a genuine disciple of Christ, and having
had experience of it.

<span id="iv.lxxix-p8"></span> [John
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#014.md),
[15](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#015.md)<span id="iv.lxxix-p8.1"></span> .
“Ye are My friends  <span id="fr_2199"></span>[2200](#fn_2199.md)
—henceforth I call you not servants, for the servant knoweth not what
his lord doeth.  Ye are My friends, for  <span
id="fr_2200"></span>[2201](#fn_2200.md) all things which I have heard of My
Father I have made known unto you.”

<span id="iv.lxxix-p11"></span>How then saith He, “I have many things to
tell you, but ye cannot bear them now”? ( [John
16.12](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#012.md)<span id="iv.lxxix-p11.1"></span>
.) By the “all” and the “hearing” He showeth nothing else, but that He
uttered nothing alien, but only what was of the Father. And since to
speak of secrets appears to be the strongest proof of friendship, “ye
have,” He saith, “been deemed worthy even of this communion.” When
however He saith “all,” He meaneth, “whatever things it was fit that
they should hear.” Then He putteth also another sure proof of
friendship, no common one. Of what sort was that?

<span id="iv.lxxix-p12"></span> [John
15.16](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#016.md)<span id="iv.lxxix-p12.1"></span>
. “Ye have not chosen Me, but I have chosen you.”

<span id="iv.lxxix-p13"></span>That is, I ran upon your friendship. And
He stayed not here, but,

<span id="iv.lxxix-p14"></span> “I set you,”  <span
id="fr_2201"></span>[2202](#fn_2201.md) He saith, (that is, “I planted
you,”) “that ye should go,” (He still useth the metaphor of the vine,)
that is, “that ye should extend yourselves”; “and bring forth fruit, and
that your fruit should remain.”

<span id="iv.lxxix-p16"></span>“Now if your fruit remain, much more
shall ye. For I have not only loved you,” He saith, “but have done you
the greatest benefits, by extending your branches through all the
world.” Seest thou in how many ways He showeth His love? By telling them
things secret, by having in the first instance run to meet their
friendship, by granting them the greatest blessings, by suffering for
them what then He suffered. After this, He showeth that He also
remaineth continually with those who shall bring forth fruit; for it is
needful to enjoy His aid, and so to bear fruit.

<span id="iv.lxxix-p17"></span>“That whatsoever ye shall ask of the
Father in My Name, He may give it you.”

<span id="iv.lxxix-p18"></span>Yet it is the part of the person asked to
do the thing asked; but if the Father is asked, how is it that the Son
doeth it? It is that thou mayest learn that the Son is not inferior to
the Father.

<span id="iv.lxxix-p19"></span> [John
15.17](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#017.md)<span id="iv.lxxix-p19.1"></span>
. “These things I command you, that ye love one another.”

<span id="iv.lxxix-p20"></span> That is, “It is not to upbraid, that I
tell you that I lay down My life for you, or that I ran to meet you, but
in order to lead you into friendship.” Then, since the being persecuted
and insulted by the many, was a grievous and intolerable thing, and
enough to humble even a lofty soul, therefore, after having said ten
thousand things first, Christ entered upon this matter.  <span
id="fr_2202"></span>[2203](#fn_2202.md)   <span id="page_281">p. 281</span>
<span id="iv.lxxix-Page_281"></span> Having first smoothed their minds,
He thus proceedeth to these points, showing that these things too were
for their exceeding advantage, as He had also shown that the others
were. For as He had told them that they ought not to grieve, but rather
to rejoice, “because I go to the Father,” (since He did this not as
deserting but as greatly loving them,) so here also He showeth that they
ought to rejoice, not grieve. And observe how He effecteth this. He said
not, “I know that the action is grievous, but bear for My sake, since
for My sake also ye suffer,” for this reason was not yet sufficient to
console them; wherefore letting this pass, He putteth forward another.
And what is that? It is that this thing  <span
id="fr_2203"></span>[2204](#fn_2203.md) would be a sure proof of their
former virtue. “And, on the contrary, ye ought to grieve, not because ye
are hated now but if ye were likely to be loved”; for this He implieth
by saying,

<span id="iv.lxxix-p23"></span> [John
15.19](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#019.md)<span id="iv.lxxix-p23.1"></span>
. “If ye were of the world, the world would love its own.”  <span
id="fr_2204"></span>[2205](#fn_2204.md)

<span id="iv.lxxix-p25"></span>So that had ye been loved it would be
very clear that ye had shown forth signs of wickedness. Then, when by
saying this first, He did not effect his purpose, He goeth on again with
the discourse.

<span id="iv.lxxix-p26"></span> [John
15.20](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#020.md)<span id="iv.lxxix-p26.1"></span>
. “The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted Me,
they will also persecute you.”  <span
id="fr_2205"></span>[2206](#fn_2205.md)

<span id="iv.lxxix-p28"></span>He showed that in this point they would
be most His imitators. For while Christ was in the flesh, men had war
with Him, but when He was translated, the battle came in the next place
upon them. Then because owing to their fewness they were terrified at
being about to encounter the attack of so great a multitude, He raiseth
their souls by telling them that it was an especial subject of joy that
they were hated by them; “For so ye shall share My sufferings. Ye should
not therefore be troubled, for ye are not better than I,” as I before
told you, “The servant is not greater than his lord.” Then there is also
a third source of consolation, that the Father also is insulted together
with them.

<span id="iv.lxxix-p29"></span> [John
15.21](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#021.md)<span id="iv.lxxix-p29.1"></span>
. “But all these things will they do unto you for My Name’s sake,
because they know not Him that sent Me.”

<span id="iv.lxxix-p30"></span>That is, “they insult Him also.” Besides
this, depriving those others of excuse, and putting also another source
of comfort, He saith,

<span id="iv.lxxix-p31"></span> [John
15.22](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#022.md)<span id="iv.lxxix-p31.1"></span>
. “If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin.”  <span
id="fr_2206"></span>[2207](#fn_2206.md)

<span id="iv.lxxix-p33"></span> Showing that they shall do unjustly both
what they do against Him and against them. “Why then didst Thou  <span
id="fr_2207"></span>[2208](#fn_2207.md) bring us into such calamities?
Didst Thou not foreknow the wars, the hatred?” Therefore again He saith,

<span id="iv.lxxix-p35"></span> [John
15.23](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#023.md)<span id="iv.lxxix-p35.1"></span>
. “He that hateth Me, hateth My Father also.”

<span id="iv.lxxix-p36"></span> From this also proclaiming beforehand no
small punishment against them. For, since they continually pretended
that they persecuted Him on account of the Father, to deprive them of
this excuse He spake these words. “They have no excuse. I gave them the
teaching which is by words, that by works I added, according to the Law
of Moses, who bade all men obey one speaking and doing such things, when
he should both lead to piety, and exhibit the greatest miracles.”  <span
id="fr_2208"></span>[2209](#fn_2208.md) And He spake not simply of “signs,”
but,

<span id="iv.lxxix-p38"></span> [John
15.24](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#024.md)<span id="iv.lxxix-p38.1"></span>
. “Which none other man did.”  <span
id="fr_2209"></span>[2210](#fn_2209.md)

<span id="iv.lxxix-p40"></span>And of this they themselves are
witnesses, speaking in this way; “It was never so seen in Israel” (
[Matt. ix. 33](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#033.md) <span
id="iv.lxxix-p40.1"></span> ); and, “Since the world began was it not
heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind” ( [John
9.32](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#032.md)<span id="iv.lxxix-p40.2"></span>
); and the matter of Lazarus was of the same kind, and all the other
acts the same, and the mode of wonder-working new, and all beyond  <span
id="fr_2210"></span>[2211](#fn_2210.md) thought. “Why then,” saith one, “do
they persecute both Thee and us?” “Because ye are not of the world. If
ye were of the world, the world would love its own.” ( [John
15.19](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#019.md)<span id="iv.lxxix-p41.3"></span>
.) He first remindeth them of the words which He spake also to His own
brethren ( [John 7.7](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#007.md)<span
id="iv.lxxix-p41.4"></span> ); but there he spake more by way of a
reflection,  <span id="fr_2211"></span>[2212](#fn_2211.md) lest He should
offend them, while here, on the contrary, He revealed all. “And how is
it clear that it is on this account that we are hated?” “From what was
done to Me. For, tell Me, which of My words or deeds could they lay hold
on, that they would not receive Me?” Then since the thing would be
astounding to us, He telleth the cause; that is, their wickedness. And
He stayeth not here either, but introduceth the Prophet ( [Ps.
35:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#019.md), [Ps.
69:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#004.md)<span id="iv.lxxix-p42.3"></span>
), showing him proclaiming before of old time, and saying, that,

<span id="iv.lxxix-p43"></span> [John
15.25](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#025.md)<span id="iv.lxxix-p43.1"></span>
. “They hated Me without a cause.”  <span
id="fr_2212"></span>[2213](#fn_2212.md)

<span id="iv.lxxix-p45"></span>\[3.\] Which Paul doth also. For when
many wondered how that the Jews believed not, he brings in Prophets
foretelling it of old, and declaring the cause; that their wickedness
and pride were the cause of their unbelief. “Well then; if they kept not
Thy saying, neither will they keep ours; if they persecuted Thee,
therefore they will persecute us also; if they saw signs, such as none
other man wrought; if they <span id="page_282">p. 282</span> <span
id="iv.lxxix-Page_282"></span> heard words such as none other spake, and
profited nothing; if they hate Thy Father and Thee with Him, wherefore,”
saith one, “hast Thou sent us in among them? How after this shall we be
worthy of belief? which of our kindred will give-heed to us?” That they
may not therefore be troubled by such thoughts, see what sort of comfort
he addeth.

<span id="iv.lxxix-p46"></span> [John
15:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#026.md),
[27](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#027.md)<span id="iv.lxxix-p46.1"></span> .
“When the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father,
even the Spirit of Truth, which proceedeth from the Father, He shall
testify of Me. And ye also shall bear witness, because ye have been with
Me from the beginning.”

<span id="iv.lxxix-p47"></span> “He shall be worthy of belief, for He is
the Spirit of Truth.” On this account He called It not “Holy Spirit,”
but “Spirit of Truth.” But the, “proceedeth from the Father,” showeth
that He  <span id="fr_2213"></span>[2214](#fn_2213.md) knoweth all things
exactly, as Christ also saith of Himself, that “I know whence come and
whither I go” ( [John 8.14](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#014.md)<span
id="iv.lxxix-p48.2"></span> ), speaking in that place also concerning
truth. “Whom will send.” Behold, it is no longer the Father alone, but
the Son also who sendeth. “And ye too,” He saith, “have a right to be
believed, who have been with Me, who have not heard from others.”
Indeed, the Apostles confidently rely on this circumstance, saying, “We
who did eat and drink with Him.” ( [Acts x.
41](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#041.md) <span id="iv.lxxix-p48.3"></span>
.) And to show that this was not merely said to please, the Spirit
beareth witness to the words spoken. ( [Acts x.
44](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#044.md) <span id="iv.lxxix-p48.4"></span>
.)

<span id="iv.lxxix-p49"></span> [John
16.1](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#001.md)<span id="iv.lxxix-p49.1"></span>
. “These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be offended.”

<span id="iv.lxxix-p50"></span>That is, “when ye see many disbelieve,
and yourselves ill-treated.”

<span id="iv.lxxix-p51"></span> [John
16.2](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#002.md)<span id="iv.lxxix-p51.1"></span>
. “They shall put you out of the synagogues.”

<span id="iv.lxxix-p52"></span>(For “the Jews had already agreed, that
if any one should confess Christ, he should be put out of the
synagogues”— [John 9.22](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#022.md)<span
id="iv.lxxix-p52.1"></span> .)

<span id="iv.lxxix-p53"></span>“Yea, the time cometh, that whosoever
killeth you will think that he doeth God service.”

<span id="iv.lxxix-p54"></span> “They shall so seek after  <span
id="fr_2214"></span>[2215](#fn_2214.md) your murder, as of an action pious
and pleasing to God.” Then again He addeth the consolation,

<span id="iv.lxxix-p56"></span> [John
16.3](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#003.md)<span id="iv.lxxix-p56.1"></span>
. “And these things will they do,  <span
id="fr_2215"></span>[2216](#fn_2215.md) because they have not known the
Father, nor Me.”

<span id="iv.lxxix-p58"></span>“It is sufficient for your comfort that
ye endure these things for My sake, and the Father’s.” Here He remindeth
them of the blessedness of which He spake at the beginning, “Blessed are
ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all
manner of evil against you falsely, for My sake. Rejoice, and be
exceeding glad; for great is your reward in heaven.” ( [Matt.
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#011.md),
[12](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#012.md)<span id="iv.lxxix-p58.1"></span>
.)

<span id="iv.lxxix-p59"></span> [John
16.4](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#004.md)<span id="iv.lxxix-p59.1"></span>
. “These things have I told you, that when the time shall come, ye may
remember them.”  <span id="fr_2216"></span>[2217](#fn_2216.md)

<span id="iv.lxxix-p61"></span>“So, judging from these words, deem the
rest also trustworthy. For ye will not be able to say, that I
flatteringly told you only those things which would please you, nor that
the words were words of deceit; for one who intended to deceive, would
not have told you beforehand of matters likely to turn you away. I have
therefore told you before, that these things might not fall upon you
unexpectedly, and trouble you; and for another reason besides, that ye
might not say, that I did not foreknow that these things would be.
Remember then that I have told you.” And indeed the heathen always
covered their persecutions of them by a pretense of their wickedness,
driving them out as corrupters; but this did not trouble the disciples
who had heard beforehand, and knew for what they suffered. The cause of
what took place was sufficient to rouse their courage. Therefore He
everywhere handleth this, saying, “they have not known Me”; and, “for My
sake they shall do it”; and, “for My Name’s sake, and for the Father’s
sake”; and, “I suffered first”; and, “from no just cause they dare these
things.”

<span id="iv.lxxix-p62"></span> \[4.\] Let us too consider these things
in our temptations, when we suffer anything from wicked men, “looking to
the Beginner  <span id="fr_2217"></span>[2218](#fn_2217.md) and Finisher of
our faith” ( [Heb. xii. 2](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#002.md) <span
id="iv.lxxix-p63.4"></span> ), and considering that it is by wicked men,
and that it is for virtue’s sake, and for His sake. For if we reflect on
these things, all will be most easy and tolerable. Since if one
suffering for those he loves is even proud of it, what feeling of things
dreadful will he have who suffers for the sake of God? For if He, for
our sake, calleth that shameful thing, the Cross, “glory” ( [John
13.31](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#031.md)<span id="iv.lxxix-p63.5"></span>
), much more ought we to be thus disposed. And if we can so despise
sufferings, much more shall we be able to despise riches, and
covetousness. We ought then, when about to endure anything unpleasant,
to think not of the toils but of the crowns; for as merchants take into
account not the seas only, but also the profits, so ought we to reckon
on heaven and confidence towards God. And if the getting more seem a
pleasant thing, think that Christ willeth it not, and straightway it
will appear displeasing. And if it be grievous to you to give to the
poor, stay not your reckoning at the expense, but straightway transport
your thoughts to the harvest which results from the sowing; and when it
is hard to despise the love of a strange woman, think of the crown which
comes after the struggle, and thou shalt easily bear the struggle. For
if fear diverts a man from unseemly things, much more should the <span
id="page_283">p. 283</span> <span id="iv.lxxix-Page_283"></span> love of
Christ. Difficult is virtue; but let us cast around her form the
greatness of the promise of things to come. Indeed those who are
virtuous, even apart from these promises, see her beautiful in herself,
and on this account go after her, and work because it seems good to God,
not for hire; and they think it a great thing to be sober-minded, not in
order that they may not be punished, but because God hath commanded it.
But if any one is too weak for this, let him think of the prizes. So let
us do in respect of alms-doing, let us pity our fellow-men, let us not,
I entreat,  <span id="fr_2218"></span>[2219](#fn_2218.md) neglect them when
perishing with hunger. How can it be otherwise than an unseemly thing,
that we should sit at the table laughing and enjoying ourselves, and
when we hear others wailing as they pass through the street, should not
even turn at their cries, but be wroth with them, and call them “cheat”?
“What meanest thou, man? Doth any one plan a cheat for a single loaf of
bread?” “Yes,” saith some one. Then in this case above all let him be
pitied; in this case above all let him be delivered from his need. Or if
thou art not minded to give, do not insult either; if thou wilt not save
the wreck, do not thrust it into the gulf. For consider, when thou
thrustest away the poor man who comes to thee, who thou wilt be when
thou callest upon God. “With what measure ye mete, it shall be measured
to you again.” ( [Matt. vii. 2](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#002.md) <span
id="iv.lxxix-p64.3"></span> .) Consider how he departs, crushed, bowed
down, lamenting; besides his poverty having received also the blow from
your insolence. For if ye count the begging a curse, think what a
tempest it makes, begging to get nothing, but to go away insulted. How
long shall we be like wild beasts, and know not nature itself through
greediness? Many groan at these words; but I desire them not now, but
always, to have this feeling of compassion. Think, I pray you, of that
day when we shall stand before the judgment-seat of Christ, when we
shall beg for mercy, and Christ, bringing them forward, shall say, “For
the sake of a single loaf, of a single obol, so great a surge did ye
raise in these souls!” What shall we reply? What defense shall we make?
To show that He will bring them forward, hear what He saith; “Inasmuch
as ye did it not to one of these, ye did it not to Me.” ( [Matt. xxv.
45](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#045.md) <span id="iv.lxxix-p64.4"></span>
.) They will no more say anything to us, but God on their behalf will
upbraid us. Since the rich man saw Lazarus too,  <span
id="fr_2219"></span>[2220](#fn_2219.md) and Lazarus said nothing to him,
but Abraham spake for him; and thus it will be in the case of the poor
who are now despised by us. We shall not see them stretching out their
hands in pitiful state, but being in rest; and we shall take the state
which was theirs (and would that it were that state only, and not one
much more grievous) as a punishment. For neither did the rich man desire
to be filled with crumbs “there,” but was scorched and tormented
sharply, and was told, “Thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things,
and likewise Lazarus evil things.” ( [Luke xvi.
25](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#025.md) <span id="iv.lxxix-p65.2"></span>
.) Let us not then deem wealth any great thing; it will help us on our
way to punishment, if we take not heed, just as, if we take heed,
poverty also becomes to us an addition of enjoyment and rest. For we
both put off our sins if we bear it with thankfulness, and gain great
boldness before God.

<span id="iv.lxxix-p66"></span>\[5.\] Let us then not be ever seeking
security here, in order that we may enjoy security there; but let us
accept the labors which are in behalf of virtue, and cut off
superfluities, and seek nothing more than we need, and spend all our
substance on those who want. Since what excuse can we have, when God
promiseth heaven to us, and we will not even give Him bread? when He
indeed for thee maketh the sun to rise, and supplieth all the ministry
of the Creation, but thou dost not even give Him a garment, nor allow
Him to share thy roof? But why speak I of sun and moon? He hath set His
Body before thee, He hath given thee His Precious Blood; and dost thou
not even impart to Him of thy cup? But hast thou done so for once? This
is not mercy; as long as, having the means, thou helpest not, thou hast
not yet fulfilled the whole duty. Thus the virgins who had the lamps,
had oil, but not in abundance. Why, thou oughtest, even didst thou give
from thine own, not to be so miserly, but now when thou givest what is
thy Lord’s, why countest thou every little? Will ye that I tell you the
cause of this inhumanity? When men get together their wealth through
greediness, these same are slow to give alms; for one who has learnt so
to gain, knows not how to spend. For how can a man prepared for rapine
adapt himself to its contrary? He who takes from others, how shall he be
able to give up his own to another? A dog accustomed to feed on flesh
cannot guard the flock; therefore the shepherds kill such. That this be
not our fate, let us refrain from such feasting. For these men too feed
on flesh, when they bring on death by hunger. Seest thou not how God
hath allowed to us all things in common? If amid riches He hath suffered
men to be poor, it is for the consolation of the rich, that they may be
able by showing mercy towards them to put off their sins. But thou even
in this hast been cruel and inhuman; whence it is evident, that if thou
hadst received this same power in greater things, thou wouldest have
committed ten thousand murders, and wouldest have debarred men from
light, <span id="page_284">p. 284</span> <span
id="iv.lxxix-Page_284"></span> and from life altogether.  <span
id="fr_2220"></span>[2221](#fn_2220.md) That this might not take place,
necessity hath cut short insatiableness in such matters.

<span id="iv.lxxix-p68"></span> If ye are pained when ye hear these
things, much more I when I see them taking place. How long shalt thou be
rich, and that man poor? Till evening, but no farther; for so short is
life, and all things so near their end,  <span
id="fr_2221"></span>[2222](#fn_2221.md) and all things henceforth so stand
at the door, that the whole must be deemed but a little hour. What need
hast thou of bursting  <span id="fr_2222"></span>[2223](#fn_2222.md)
storehouses, of a multitude of domestics and house-keepers? Why hast
thou not ten thousand proclaimers of thy almsdoing? The storehouse
utters no voice, yet will it bring upon thee many robbers; but the
storehouses of the poor will go up to God Himself, and will make thy
present life sweet, and put away all thy sins, and thou shalt gain glory
from God, and honor from men. Why then grudgest thou thyself such good
things? For thou wilt not do so much good to the poor, as to thyself,
when thou benefitest them. Thou wilt right their present state; but for
thyself thou wilt lay up beforehand the glory and confidence which shall
be hereafter. And this may we all obtain, by the grace and
lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom with the Father and the
Holy Ghost be the glory and the might for ever. Amen.
