<span id="iv.xxxii-p1"></span> <span class="c15"><span
id="iv.xxxii-p1.1"></span>Homily XXX.</span>

<span id="iv.xxxii-p2"></span> <span id="iv.xxxii-p2.1"></span> <span
class="c1"><span id="iv.xxxii-p2.2"></span>[John iii.
31](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#031.md)<span
id="iv.xxxii-p2.3"></span></span>

<span id="iv.xxxii-p3"></span>“He that cometh from above is above all;
he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth.”

<span id="iv.xxxii-p4"></span> \[1.\] <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.xxxii-p4.1"></span>A dreadful</span> thing is the love of glory,
dreadful and full of many evils; it is a thorn hard to be extracted, a
wild beast untamable and many headed, arming itself against those that
feed it; for as the worm eats through the wood from which it is born, as
rust wastes the iron whence it comes forth, and moths the fleeces, so
vainglory destroys the soul which nourishes it; and therefore we need
great diligence to remove the passion.  Observe here how long a charm
John uses over  <span id="fr_755"></span>[756](#fn_755.md) the disciples
affected by it, and can scarcely pacify them. For he softens  <span
id="fr_756"></span>[757](#fn_756.md) them with other words besides those
already mentioned. And what are these others? “He that cometh from
above,” he saith, “is above all; he that is of the earth, is earthly,
and speaketh of the earth.” Since you make much ado with my testimony,
 <span id="fr_757"></span>[758](#fn_757.md) and in this way say that I am
more worthy of credit than He, you needs must know this, that it is
impossible for One who cometh from heaven to have His credit
strengthened by one that inhabiteth earth.

<span id="iv.xxxii-p8"></span>And what means “above all,” what is the
expression intended to show to us? That Christ hath need of nothing, but
is Himself sufficient for Himself, and incomparably greater than all; of
himself John speaks as being “of the earth, and speaking of the earth.”
Not that he spake of his own mind, but as Christ said, “If I have told
you of earthly things and ye believe not,” so calling Baptism, not
because it was an “earthly thing,” but because He compared it when He
spake with His own Ineffable Generation, so here John said that he spake
“of earth,” comparing his own with Christ’s teaching. For the “speaking
of earth” means nothing else than this, “My things are little and low
and poor compared with His, and such as it was probable that an earthly
nature would receive. In Him ‘are hid all the treasures of wisdom.’” (
[Col. ii. 5](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#005.md) <span
id="iv.xxxii-p8.1"></span> .) That he speaks not of human reasonings is
plain from this. “He that is of the earth,” saith he, “is earthly.” Yet
not all in him was earthly, but the higher parts were heavenly, for he
had a soul, and was partaker of a Spirit which was not of earth. How
then saith he that he is “earthly”? Seest thou not that he means only,
“I am small and of no esteem, going on the ground and born in the earth;
but Christ came to us from above.” Having by all these means quenched
their passion, he afterwards speaks more openly of Christ; for before
this it was useless to utter words which could never have gained a place
in the understanding of his hearers: but when he hath pulled up the
thorns, he then boldly casts in the seed, saying,

<span id="iv.xxxii-p9"></span> [John
3:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#031.md),
[32](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#032.md)<span id="iv.xxxii-p9.1"></span> .
“He that cometh from above is above all. And what He hath heard He
speaketh, and what He hath seen He testifieth;  <span
id="fr_758"></span>[759](#fn_758.md) and no man receiveth His testimony.”

<span id="iv.xxxii-p11"></span>Having uttered something great and
sublime concerning Him, he again brings down his discourse to a humbler
strain. For the expression, “what He hath heard and seen,” is suited
rather to a mere man. What He knew He knew not from having learned it by
sight, or from having heard it, but He included the whole in His Nature,
having come forth perfect from the Bosom of His Father, and needing none
to teach Him. For, “As the Father,” He saith, “knoweth Me, even so know
I the Father.” ( [John 10.13](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#013.md)<span
id="iv.xxxii-p11.1"></span> .) What then means, “He speaketh that He
hath heard, and testifieth that He hath seen”? Since <span
id="page_103">p. 103</span> <span id="iv.xxxii-Page_103"></span> by
these senses we gain correct knowledge of everything, and are deemed
worthy of credit when we teach on matters which our eyes have embraced
and our ears have taken in, as not in such cases inventing or speaking
falsehoods, John desiring here to establish this point,  <span
id="fr_759"></span>[760](#fn_759.md) said, “What He hath heard and seen”:
that is, “nothing that cometh from Him is false, but all is true.” Thus
we when we are making curious enquiry into anything, often ask, “Didst
thou hear it?” “Didst thou see it?” And if this be proved, the testimony
is indubitable, and so when Christ Himself saith, “As I hear, I judge” (
[John 5.30](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#030.md)<span
id="iv.xxxii-p12.2"></span> ); and, “What I have heard from My Father,
that I speak”  <span id="fr_760"></span>[761](#fn_760.md) ( [John
15.15](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#015.md)<span id="iv.xxxii-p13.4"></span>
); and, “We speak  <span id="fr_761"></span>[762](#fn_761.md) that We have
seen” ( [John 3.11](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#011.md)<span
id="iv.xxxii-p14.3"></span> ); and whatsoever other sayings He uttereth
of the kind, are uttered not that we might imagine that He saith what He
doth being taught of any, (it were extreme folly to think this,) but in
order that nothing of what is said may be suspected by the shameless
Jews. For because they had not yet a right opinion concerning Him, He
continually betakes Himself to His Father, and hence makes His sayings
credible.

<span id="iv.xxxii-p15"></span>\[2.\] And why wonderest thou if He
betake Himself to the Father, when He often resorts to the Prophets and
the Scriptures? as when He saith, “They are they that testify of Me.” (
[John 5.39](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#039.md)<span
id="iv.xxxii-p15.1"></span> .)  Shall we then say that He is inferior to
the Prophets, because He draws testimonies from them? Away with the
thought. It is because of the infirmity of His hearers that He so orders
His discourse, and saith that He spake what He spake having heard it
from the Father, not because He needed a teacher, but that they might
believe that nothing that He said was false. John’s meaning is of this
kind: “I desire to hear what He saith, for He cometh from above,
bringing thence those tidings which none but life knoweth rightly; for
‘what He hath seen and heard,’ is the expression of one who declareth
this.”

<span id="iv.xxxii-p16"></span>“And no man receiveth His testimony.” Yet
He had disciples, and many besides gave heed to His words. How then
saith John, “No man”? He saith “no man,” instead of “few men,” for had
he meant “no man at all,” how could he have added,

<span id="iv.xxxii-p17"></span> [John
3.33](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#033.md)<span id="iv.xxxii-p17.1"></span>
. “He that hath received His testimony, hath set to his seal that God is
true.”

<span id="iv.xxxii-p18"></span>Here he touches his own disciples, as not
being likely for a time to be firm believers. And that they did not even
after this believe in Him, is clear from what is said afterwards; for
John even when dwelling in prison sent them thence to Christ, that he
might the more bind them to Him. Yet even then they scarcely believed,
to which Christ alluded when He said, “And blessed is he whosoever shall
not be offended in Me.” ( [Matt. xi. 6](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#006.md)
<span id="iv.xxxii-p18.1"></span> .) And therefore now he said, “And no
man receiveth His testimony,” to make sure his own disciples; all but
saying, “Do not, because for a time few shall believe on Him, therefore
deem that His words are false; for, ‘He speaketh that He hath seen.’”
Moreover he saith this to touch also the insensibility of the Jews. A
charge which the Evangelist at commencing  <span
id="fr_762"></span>[763](#fn_762.md) brought against them, saying, “He came
unto His own, and His own received Him not.” For this is no reproach
against Him, but an accusation of those who received Him not. ( [John
1.11](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#011.md)<span id="iv.xxxii-p19.3"></span>
.)

<span id="iv.xxxii-p20"></span>“He that hath received His testimony hath
set to his seal that God is true.” Here he terrifies them also by
showing that he who believeth not on Him, disbelieveth not Him alone,
but the Father also; wherefore he adds:

<span id="iv.xxxii-p21"></span> [John
3.34](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#034.md)<span id="iv.xxxii-p21.1"></span>
. “He whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God.”

<span id="iv.xxxii-p22"></span>Since then He speaketh His words, he that
believeth and he that believeth not, believeth or believeth not God.
“Hath set to His seal,” that is, “hath declared.” Then, to increase
their dread, he saith, “that God is true;” thus showing, that no man
could disbelieve Christ without making God who sent Him guilty of a
falsehood. Because, since He saith nothing save what is from the Father,
but all that He saith is His, he that heareth not Him, heareth not Him
that sent Him. See how by these words again he strikes them with fear.
As yet they thought it no great thing not to hearken to Christ; and
therefore he held so great a danger above the heads of the unbelievers,
that they might learn that they hearken not to God Himself, who hearken
not to Christ. Then he proceeds with the discourse, descending to the
measure of their infirmity, and saying,

<span id="iv.xxxii-p23"></span>“For God giveth not the Spirit by
measure.”

<span id="iv.xxxii-p24"></span>Again, as I said, he brings down his
discourse to lower ground, varying it and making it suitable to be
received by those who heard it then; otherwise he could not have raised
them and increased their fear. For had he spoken anything great and
sublime concerning Jesus Himself, they would not have believed, but
might even have despised Him. Therefore he leads up all to the Father,
speaking for a while of Christ as of a man. But what is it that he
saith, “God giveth not the Spirit by measure”? He would show that we all
have received the operation of the Spirit, by measure, (for in this
place he means by “Spirit” the operation of the Spirit, for this it is
that is divided,) but that Christ hath all Its operation unmeasured and
entire. Now if His operations be unmeasured, <span id="page_104">p.
104</span> <span id="iv.xxxii-Page_104"></span> much more His Essence.
Seest thou too that the Spirit is Infinite? How then can He who hath
received all the operation of the Spirit, who knoweth the things of God,
who saith, “We speak that We have heard, and testify that We have seen”
( [John 3.11](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#011.md)<span
id="iv.xxxii-p24.1"></span> ), be rightly suspected? He saith nothing
which is not “of God,” or which is not of “the Spirit.” And for a while
he uttereth nothing concerning God the Word,  <span
id="fr_763"></span>[764](#fn_763.md) but maketh all his doctrine credible
by (reference to) the Father and the Spirit. For that there is a God
they knew, and that there is a Spirit they knew, (even though they held
not a right opinion concerning Him,) but that there is a Son, they knew
not. It is for this reason that he ever has recourse to the Father and
the Spirit, thence confirming his words. For if any one should take no
account of this reason, and examine his language by itself, it  <span
id="fr_764"></span>[765](#fn_764.md) would fall very far short of the
Dignity of Christ. Christ was not therefore worthy of their faith,
because He had the operation of the Spirit, (for He needeth not aid from
thence,) but is Himself Self-sufficient; only for a while the Baptist
speaks to the understanding of the simpler  <span
id="fr_765"></span>[766](#fn_765.md) sort, desiring to raise them up by
degrees from their low notions.

<span id="iv.xxxii-p28"></span>And this I say, that we may not
carelessly pass by what is contained in the Scriptures, but may fully
consider the object of the speaker, and the infirmity of the hearers,
and many other points in them. For teachers do not say all as they
themselves would wish, but generally as the state of their weak
(hearers) requires. Wherefore Paul saith, “I could not speak unto you as
unto spiritual, but as unto carnal; I have fed you with milk, and not
with meat.” ( [1 Cor. 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#001.md),
[2](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#002)<span id="iv.xxxii-p28.1"></span> ..md)
He means, “I desired indeed to speak unto you as unto spiritual, but
could not”; not because he was unable, but because they were not able so
to hear. So too John desired to teach some great things to the
disciples, but they could not yet bear to receive them, and therefore he
dwells for the most part on that which is lowlier.

<span id="iv.xxxii-p29"></span> It behooves us therefore to explore all
carefully. For the words of the Scriptures are our spiritual weapons;
but if we know not how to fit those weapons and to arm our scholars
rightly, they keep indeed their proper power, but cannot help those who
receive them. For let us suppose there to be a strong corselet, and
helm, and shield, and spear; and let one take this armor and put the
corselet upon his feet, the helmet over his eyes instead of on his head,
let him not put the shield before his breast, but perversely tie it to
his legs: will he be able to gain any advantage from the armor? will he
not rather be harmed? It is plain to any one that he will. Yet not on
account of the weakness of the weapons, but on account of the
unskillfulness of the man who knows not how to use them well. So with
the Scriptures, if we confound their order; they will even so retain
their proper force, yet will do us no good. Although I am always telling
you this both in private and in public, I effect nothing, but see you
all your time nailed to the things of this life, and not so much as
dreaming  <span id="fr_766"></span>[767](#fn_766.md) of spiritual matters.
Therefore our lives are careless, and we who strive for truth have but
little power, and are become a laughing stock to Greeks and Jews and
Heretics. Had ye been careless in other matters, and exhibited in this
place the same indifference as elsewhere, not even so could your doings
have been defended; but now in matters of this life, every one of you,
artisan and politician alike, is keener than a sword, while in necessary
and spiritual things we are duller than any; making by-work business,
and not deeming that which we ought to have esteemed more pressing than
any business, to be by-work even. Know ye not that the Scriptures were
written not for the first of mankind alone, but for our sakes also?
Hearest thou not Paul say, that “they are written for our admonition,
upon whom the ends of the world are come; that we through patience and
comfort of the Scriptures might have hope”? ( [1 Cor.
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#011.md), [Rom.
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#004.md)<span id="iv.xxxii-p30.4"></span>
.) I know that I speak in vain, yet will I not cease to speak, for thus
I shall clear myself  <span id="fr_767"></span>[768](#fn_767.md) before
God, though there be none to hear me. He that speaketh to them that give
heed hath this at least to cheer his speech, the persuasion of his
hearers; but he that speaks continually and is not listened to, and yet
ceaseth not to speak, may be worthy of greater honor than the other,
because he fulfills the will of God, even though none give heed unto
him, to the best of his power. Still, though our reward will be greater
owing to your disobedience, we rather desire that it be diminished, and
that your salvation be advanced, thinking that your being well approved
of  <span id="fr_768"></span>[769](#fn_768.md) is a great reward. And we
now say this not to make our discourse painful and burdensome to you,
but to show to you the grief which we feel by reason of your
indifference. God grant that we may be all of us delivered from this,
that we may cling to spiritual zeal and obtain the blessings of heaven,
through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, with whom
to the Father and the Holy Ghost be glory, for ever and ever. Amen.
