<span id="vi.iii.i.viii"></span>

##### <span id="vi.iii.i.viii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VIII.—Against Those Who Think that What is Just is Not Good.

<span id="vi.iii.i.viii-p1"></span>At this stage some rise up, saying
that the Lord, by reason of the rod, and threatening, and fear, is not
good; misapprehending, as appears, the Scripture which says, “And he
that feareth the Lord will turn to his heart;” <span
id="fr_1171"></span>[1172](#fn_1171.md) and most of all, oblivious of His
love, in that for us He became man. For more suitably to Him, the
prophet prays in these words: “Remember us, for we are dust;” <span
id="fr_1172"></span>[1173](#fn_1172.md) that is, Sympathize with us; for
Thou knowest from personal experience of suffering the weakness of the
flesh. In this respect, therefore, the Lord the Instructor is most good
and unimpeachable, sympathizing as He does from the exceeding greatness
of His love with the nature of each man. “For there is nothing which the
Lord hates.” <span id="fr_1173"></span>[1174](#fn_1173.md) For assuredly He
does not hate anything, and yet wish that which He hates to exist. Nor
does He wish anything not to exist, and yet become the cause of
existence to that which He wishes not to exist. Nor does He wish
anything not to exist which yet exists. If, then, the Word hates
anything, He does not wish it to exist. But nothing exists, the cause of
whose existence is not supplied by God. Nothing, then, is hated by God,
nor yet by the Word. For both are one—that is, God. For He has said, “In
the beginning the Word was in God, and the Word was God.” <span
id="fr_1174"></span>[1175](#fn_1174.md) If then He hates none of the things
which He has made, it follows that He loves them. Much more than the
rest, and with reason, will He love man, the noblest of all objects
created by Him, and a God-loving being. Therefore God is loving;
consequently the Word is loving.

<span id="vi.iii.i.viii-p6"></span>But he who loves anything wishes to
do it good. And that which does good must be every way better than that
which does not good. But nothing is better than the Good. The Good,
then, does good. And God is admitted to be good. God therefore does
good. And the Good, in virtue of its being good, does nothing else than
do good. Consequently God does all good. And He does no good to man
without caring for him, and He does not care *for* him without taking
care *of* him. For that which does good purposely, is better than what
does not good purposely. But nothing is better than God. And to do good
purposely, is nothing else than to take care of man. God therefore cares
for man, and takes care of him. And He shows this practically, in
instructing him by the Word, who is the true coadjutor of God’s love to
man. But the good is not said to be good, on account of its being
possessed of virtue; as also righteousness is not said to be good on
account of its possessing virtue—for it is itself virtue—but on account
of its being in itself and by itself good.

<span id="vi.iii.i.viii-p7"></span>In another way the useful is called
good, not on account of its pleasing, but of its doing good. All which,
therefore, is righteousness, being a good thing, both as virtue and as
desirable for its own sake, and not as giving pleasure; for it does not
judge in order to win favour, but dispenses to each according to his
merits. And the beneficial follows the useful. Righteousness, therefore,
has characteristics corresponding to all the aspects in which goodness
is examined, both possessing equal properties equally. And things which
are characterized by equal properties are equal and similar to each
other. Righteousness is therefore a good thing.

<span id="vi.iii.i.viii-p8"></span>“How then,” say they, “if the Lord
loves man, and is good, is He angry and punishes?” We must therefore
treat of this point with all possible brevity; for this mode of
treatment is advantageous to the right training of the children,
occupying the place of a necessary help. For many of the passions are
cured by punishment, and by the inculcation of the sterner precepts, as
also by instruction in certain principles. For reproof is, as it were,
the surgery of the passions of the soul; and the passions are, as it
were, an abscess of the truth, <span
id="fr_1175"></span>[1176](#fn_1175.md) which must be cut open by an
incision of the lancet of reproof.

<span id="vi.iii.i.viii-p10"></span>Reproach is like the application of
medicines, dissolving the callosities of the passions, and purging the
impurities of the lewdness of the life; and in addition, reducing the
excrescences of pride, restoring the patient to the healthy and true
state of humanity.

<span id="vi.iii.i.viii-p11"></span>Admonition is, as it were, the
regimen of the diseased soul, prescribing what it must take, and
forbidding what it must not. And all these tend to salvation and eternal
health.

<span id="vi.iii.i.viii-p12"></span>Furthermore, the general of an army,
by inflicting fines and corporeal punishments with chains and the
extremest disgrace on offenders, <span id="page_226">p. 226</span> <span
id="vi.iii.i.viii-Page_226"></span>and sometimes even by punishing
individuals with death, aims at good, doing so for the admonition of the
officers under him.

<span id="vi.iii.i.viii-p13"></span>Thus also He who is our great
General, the Word, the Commander-in-chief of the universe, by
admonishing those who throw off the restraints of His law, that He may
effect their release from the slavery, error, and captivity of the
adversary, brings them peacefully to the sacred concord of citizenship.

<span id="vi.iii.i.viii-p14"></span>As, therefore in addition to
persuasive discourse, there is the hortatory and the consolatory form;
so also, in addition to the laudatory, there is the inculpatory and
reproachful. And this latter constitutes the art of censure. Now censure
is a mark of good-will, not of ill-will. For both he who is a friend and
he who is not, reproach; but the enemy does so in scorn, the friend in
kindness. It is not, then, from hatred that the Lord chides men; for He
Himself suffered for us, whom He might have destroyed for our faults.
For the Instructor also, in virtue of His being good, with consummate
art glides into censure by rebuke; rousing the sluggishness of the mind
by His sharp words as by a scourge. Again in turn He endeavours to
exhort the same persons. For those who are not induced by praise are
spurred on by censure; and those whom censure calls not forth to
salvation being as dead, are by denunciation roused to the truth. “For
the stripes and correction of wisdom are in all time.” “For teaching a
fool is gluing a potsherd; and sharpening to sense a hopeless blockhead
is bringing earth to sensation.” <span
id="fr_1176"></span>[1177](#fn_1176.md) Wherefore He adds plainly, “rousing
the sleeper from deep sleep,” which of all things else is likest death.

<span id="vi.iii.i.viii-p16"></span>Further, the Lord shows very clearly
of Himself, when, describing figuratively His manifold and in many ways
serviceable culture,—He says, “I am the true vine, and my Father is the
husbandman.” Then He adds, “Every branch in me that beareth not fruit He
taketh away; and every branch that beareth fruit He pruneth, that it may
bring forth more fruit.” <span id="fr_1177"></span>[1178](#fn_1177.md) For
the vine that is not pruned grows to wood. So also man. The Word—the
knife—clears away the wanton shoots; compelling the impulses of the soul
to fructify, not to indulge in lust. Now, reproof addressed to sinners
has their salvation for its aim, the word being harmoniously adjusted to
each one’s conduct; now with tightened, now with relaxed cords.
Accordingly it was very plainly said by Moses, “Be of good courage: God
has drawn near to try you, that His fear may be among you, that ye sin
not.” <span id="fr_1178"></span>[1179](#fn_1178.md) And Plato, who had
learned from this source, says beautifully: “For all who suffer
punishment are in reality treated well, for they are benefited; since
the spirit of those who are justly punished is improved.” And if those
who are corrected receive good at the hands of justice, and, according
to Plato, what is just is acknowledged to be good, fear itself does
good, and has been found to be for men’s good. “For the soul that
feareth the Lord shall live, for their hope is in Him who saveth
them.” <span id="fr_1179"></span>[1180](#fn_1179.md) And this same Word who
inflicts punishment is judge; regarding whom Esaias also says, “The Lord
has assigned Him to our sins,” <span
id="fr_1180"></span>[1181](#fn_1180.md) plainly as a corrector and reformer
of sins. Wherefore He alone is able to forgive our iniquities, who has
been appointed by the Father, Instructor of us all; He alone it is who
is able to distinguish between disobedience and obedience. And while He
threatens, He manifestly is unwilling to inflict evil to execute His
threatenings; but by inspiring men with fear, He cuts off the approach
to sin, and shows His love to man, still delaying, and declaring what
they shall suffer if they continue sinners, and is not as a serpent,
which the moment it fastens on its prey devours it.

<span id="vi.iii.i.viii-p21"></span>God, then, is good. And the Lord
speaks many a time and oft before He proceeds to act. “For my arrows,”
He says, “will make an end of them; they shall be consumed with hunger,
and be eaten by birds; and there shall be incurable tetanic incurvature.
I will send the teeth of wild beasts upon them, with the rage of
serpents creeping on the earth. Without, the sword shall make them
childless; and out of their chambers shall be fear.” <span
id="fr_1181"></span>[1182](#fn_1181.md) For the Divine Being is not angry
in the way that some think; but often restrains, and always exhorts
humanity, and shows what ought to be done. And this is a good device, to
terrify lest we sin. “For the fear of the Lord drives away sins, and he
that is without fear cannot be justified,” <span
id="fr_1182"></span>[1183](#fn_1182.md) says the Scripture. And God does
not inflict punishment from wrath, but for the ends of justice; since it
is not expedient that justice should be neglected on our account. Each
one of us, who sins, with his own free-will chooses punishment, and the
blame lies with him who chooses. <span
id="fr_1183"></span>[1184](#fn_1183.md) God is without blame. “But if our
unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is
God unrighteous, who taketh vengeance? God forbid.” <span
id="fr_1184"></span>[1185](#fn_1184.md) He says, therefore, threatening, “I
will sharpen my sword, and my hand shall lay hold on judgment; and I
will render justice to mine enemies, and requite those who hate me. I
will make mine arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall devour <span
id="page_227">p. 227</span> <span
id="vi.iii.i.viii-Page_227"></span>flesh from the blood of the
wounded.” <span id="fr_1185"></span>[1186](#fn_1185.md) It is clear, then,
that those who are not at enmity with the truth, and do not hate the
Word, will not hate their own salvation, but will escape the punishment
of enmity. “The crown of wisdom,” then, as the book of Wisdom says, “is
the fear of the Lord.” <span id="fr_1186"></span>[1187](#fn_1186.md) Very
clearly, therefore, by the prophet Amos has the Lord unfolded His method
of dealing, saying, “I have overthrown you, as God overthrew Sodom and
Gomorrah; and ye shall be as a brand plucked from the fire: and yet ye
have not returned unto me, saith the <span class="sc"><span
id="vi.iii.i.viii-p27.2"></span>Lord</span>.” <span
id="fr_1187"></span>[1188](#fn_1187.md)

<span id="vi.iii.i.viii-p29"></span>See how God, through His love of
goodness, seeks repentance; and by means of the plan He pursues of
threatening silently, shows His own love for man. “I will avert,” He
says, “My face from them, and show what shall happen to them.” <span
id="fr_1188"></span>[1189](#fn_1188.md) For where the face of the Lord
looks, there is peace and rejoicing; but where it is averted, there is
the introduction of evil. The Lord, accordingly, does not wish to look
on evil things; for He is good. But on His looking away, evil arises
spontaneously through human unbelief. “Behold, therefore,” says Paul,
“the goodness and severity of God: on them that fell, severity; but upon
thee, goodness, if thou continue in His goodness,” <span
id="fr_1189"></span>[1190](#fn_1189.md) that is, in faith in Christ.

<span id="vi.iii.i.viii-p32"></span>Now hatred of evil attends the good
man, in virtue of His being in nature good. Wherefore I will grant that
He punishes the disobedient (for punishment is for the good and
advantage of him who is punished, for it is the correction of a
refractory subject); but I will not grant that He wishes to take
vengeance. Revenge is retribution for evil, imposed for the advantage of
him who takes the revenge. He will not desire us to take revenge, who
teaches us “to pray for those that despitefully use us.” <span
id="fr_1190"></span>[1191](#fn_1190.md) But that God is good, all willingly
admit; and that the same God is just, I require not many more words to
prove, after adducing the evangelical utterance of the Lord; He speaks
of Him as one, “That they all may be one; as Thou, Father, art in Me,
and I in Thee, that they also may be one in Us: that the world also may
believe that Thou hast sent Me. And the glory which Thou hast given Me I
have given them; that they may be one, as We are one: I in them, and
Thou in Me, that they may be made perfect in one.” <span
id="fr_1191"></span>[1192](#fn_1191.md) God is one, and beyond the one and
above the Monad itself. Wherefore also the particle “Thou,” having a
demonstrative emphasis, points out God, who alone truly is, “who was,
and is, and is to come,” in which three divisions of time the one name
(<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.iii.i.viii-p34.2"></span>ὀ ὤν</span>);
“who is,” <span id="fr_1192"></span>[1193](#fn_1192.md) has its place. And
that He who alone is God is also alone and truly righteous, our Lord in
the Gospel itself shall testify, saying “Father, I will that they also
whom Thou hast given Me be with Me where I am; that they may behold My
glory, which Thou hast given Me: For Thou lovedst Me before the
foundation of the world. O righteous Father, the world hath not known
Thee: but I have known Thee, and these have known that Thou hast sent
Me. And I have declared to them Thy name, and will declare it.” <span
id="fr_1193"></span>[1194](#fn_1193.md) This is He “that visits the
iniquities of the fathers upon the children, to them that hate Him, and
shows mercy to those that love Him.” <span
id="fr_1194"></span>[1195](#fn_1194.md) For He who placed some “on the
right hand, and others on the left,” <span
id="fr_1195"></span>[1196](#fn_1195.md) conceived as Father, being good, is
called that which alone He is—“good;” <span
id="fr_1196"></span>[1197](#fn_1196.md) but as He is the Son in the Father,
being his Word, from their mutual relation, the name of power being
measured by equality of love, He is called righteous. “He will judge,”
He says, “a man according to his works,” <span
id="fr_1197"></span>[1198](#fn_1197.md) —a good balance, even God having
made known to us the face of righteousness in the person of Jesus, by
whom also, as by even scales, we know God. Of this also the book of
Wisdom plainly says, “For mercy and wrath are with Him, for He alone is
Lord of both,” Lord of propitiations, and pouring forth wrath according
to the abundance of His mercy. “So also is His reproof.” <span
id="fr_1198"></span>[1199](#fn_1198.md) For the aim of mercy and of reproof
is the salvation of those who are reproved.

<span id="vi.iii.i.viii-p42"></span>Now, that the God and Father of our
Lord Jesus is good, the Word Himself will again avouch: “For He is kind
to the unthankful and the evil;” and further, when He says, “Be
merciful, as your Father is merciful.” <span
id="fr_1199"></span>[1200](#fn_1199.md) Still further also He plainly says,
“None is good, but My Father, who is in heaven.” <span
id="fr_1200"></span>[1201](#fn_1200.md) In addition to these, again He
says, “My Father makes His sun to shine on all.” <span
id="fr_1201"></span>[1202](#fn_1201.md) Here it is to be noted that He
proclaims His Father to be good, and to be the Creator. And that the
Creator is just, is not disputed. And again he says, “My Father sends
rain on the just, and on the unjust.” In respect of His sending rain, He
is the Creator of the waters, and of the clouds. And in respect of His
doing so on all, He holds an even balance justly and rightly. And as
being good, He does so on just and unjust alike.

<span id="vi.iii.i.viii-p46"></span>Very clearly, then, we conclude Him
to be one and the same God, thus. For the Holy Spirit has sung, “I will
look to the heavens, the works <span id="page_228">p. 228</span> <span
id="vi.iii.i.viii-Page_228"></span>of Thy hands;” <span
id="fr_1202"></span>[1203](#fn_1202.md) and, “He who created the heavens
dwells in the heavens;” and, “Heaven is Thy throne.” <span
id="fr_1203"></span>[1204](#fn_1203.md) And the Lord says in His prayer,
“Our Father, who art in heaven.” <span
id="fr_1204"></span>[1205](#fn_1204.md) And the heavens belong to Him, who
created the world. It is indisputable, then, that the Lord is the Son of
the Creator. And if, the Creator above all is confessed to be just, and
the Lord to be the Son of the Creator; then the Lord is the Son of Him
who is just. Wherefore also Paul says, “But now the righteousness of God
without the law is manifested;” <span
id="fr_1205"></span>[1206](#fn_1205.md) and again, that you may better
conceive of God, “even the righteousness of God by the faith of Jesus
Christ upon all that believe; for there is no difference.” <span
id="fr_1206"></span>[1207](#fn_1206.md) And, witnessing further to the
truth, he adds after a little, “through the forbearance of God, in order
to show that He is just, and that Jesus is the justifier of him who is
of faith.” And that he knows that what is just is good, appears by his
saying, “So that the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just,
and good,” <span id="fr_1207"></span>[1208](#fn_1207.md) using both names
to denote the same power. But “no one is good,” except His Father. It is
this same Father of His, then, who being one is manifested by many
powers. And this was the import of the utterance, “No man knew the
Father,” <span id="fr_1208"></span>[1209](#fn_1208.md) who was Himself
everything before the coming of the Son. So that it is veritably clear
that the God of all is only one good, just Creator, and the Son in the
Father, to whom be glory for ever and ever, Amen. But it is not
inconsistent with the saving Word, to administer rebuke dictated by
solicitude. For this is the medicine of the divine love to man, by which
the blush of modesty breaks forth, and shame at sin supervenes. For if
one must censure, it is necessary also to rebuke; when it is the time to
wound the apathetic soul not mortally, but salutarily, securing
exemption from everlasting death by a little pain.

<span id="vi.iii.i.viii-p54"></span>Great is the wisdom displayed in His
instruction, and manifold the modes of His dealing in order to
salvation. For the Instructor testifies to the good, and summons forth
to better things those that are called; dissuades those that are
hastening to do wrong from the attempt, and exhorts them to turn to a
better life. For the one is not without testimony, when the other has
been testified to; and the grace which proceeds from the testimony is
very great. Besides, the feeling of anger (if it is proper to call His
admonition anger) is full of love to man, God condescending to emotion
on man’s account; for whose sake also the Word of God became man.
