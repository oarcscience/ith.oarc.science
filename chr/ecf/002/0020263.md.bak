##### <span id="vi.iii.i.xiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIII.—Virtue Rational, Sin Irrational.

<span id="vi.iii.i.xiii-p1"></span>Everything that is contrary to right
reason is sin. Accordingly, therefore, the philosophers think fit to
define the most generic passions thus: lust, as desire disobedient to
reason; fear, as weakness disobedient to reason; pleasure, as an elation
of the spirit disobedient to reason. If, then, disobedience in reference
to reason is the generating cause of sin, how shall we escape the
conclusion, that obedience to reason—the Word—which we call faith, will
of necessity be the efficacious cause of duty? For virtue itself is a
state of the soul rendered harmonious by reason in respect to the whole
life. Nay, to crown all, philosophy itself is pronounced to be the
cultivation of right reason; so that, necessarily, whatever is done
through error of reason is transgression, and is rightly called, (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.iii.i.xiii-p1.1"></span>ἁμάρτημα</span>) sin.
Since, then, the first man sinned and disobeyed God, it is said, “And
man became like to the beasts:” <span
id="fr_1298"></span>[1299](#fn_1298.md) being rightly regarded as
irrational, he is likened to the beasts. Whence Wisdom says: “The horse
for covering; the libidinous and the adulturer is become like to an
irrational beast.” <span id="fr_1299"></span>[1300](#fn_1299.md) Wherefore
also it is added: “He neighs, whoever may be sitting on him.” The man,
it is meant, no longer speaks; for he who transgresses against reason is
no longer rational, but an irrational animal, given up to lusts by which
he is ridden (as a horse by his rider).

<span id="vi.iii.i.xiii-p4"></span>But that which is done right, in
obedience to reason, the followers of the Stoics call <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.iii.i.xiii-p4.1"></span>προσῆκον</span> and
<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.iii.i.xiii-p4.2"></span>καθῆκον</span>,
that is, incumbent and fitting. What is fitting is incumbent. And
obedience is founded on commands. And these being, as they are, the same
as counsel—having truth for their aim, train up to the ultimate goal of
aspiration, which is conceived of as the *end* (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.iii.i.xiii-p4.3"></span>τέλος</span>). And
the end of piety is eternal rest in God. And the beginning of eternity
is our end. The right operation of piety perfects duty by works; whence,
according to just reasoning, duties consist in actions, not in sayings.
And Christian conduct is the operation of the rational soul in
accordance with a correct judgment and aspiration after the truth, which
attains its destined end through the body, the soul’s consort and
ally. <span id="fr_1300"></span>[1301](#fn_1300.md) Virtue is a will in
conformity to God and Christ in life, rightly adjusted to life
everlasting. For the life of Christians, in which we are now trained, is
a system of reasonable actions—that is, of those things taught by the
Word—an unfailing energy which we have called faith. The system is the
commandments of the Lord, which, being divine statues and spiritual
counsels, have been written for ourselves, being adapted for ourselves
and our neighbours. Moreover, they <span id="page_236">p. 236</span>
<span id="vi.iii.i.xiii-Page_236"></span>turn back on us, as the ball
rebounds on him that throws it by the repercussion. Whence also duties
are essential for divine discipline, as being enjoined by God, and
furnished for our salvation. And since, of those things which are
necessary, some relate only to life here, and others, which relate to
the blessed life yonder, wing us for flight hence; so, in an analogous
manner, of duties, some are ordained with reference to life, others for
the blessed life. The commandments issued with respect to natural life
are published to the multitude; but those that are suited for living
well, and from which eternal life springs, we have to consider, as in a
sketch, as we read them out of the Scriptures.
