##### <span id="v.ii.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.—Charges Brought Against the Christians.

<span id="v.ii.iii-p1"></span>Three things are alleged against us:
atheism, Thyestean feasts, <span id="fr_705"></span>[706](#fn_705.md)
Œdipodean intercourse. But if these charges are true, spare no class:
proceed at once against our crimes; destroy us root and branch, with our
wives and children, if any Christian <span
id="fr_706"></span>[707](#fn_706.md) is found to live like the brutes. And
yet even the brutes do not touch the flesh of their own kind; and they
pair by a law of nature, and only at the regular season, not from simple
wantonness; they also recognise those from whom they receive benefits.
If any one, therefore, is more savage than the brutes, what punishment
that he can endure shall be deemed adequate to such offences? But, if
these things are only idle tales and empty slanders, originating in the
fact that virtue is opposed by its very nature to vice, and that
contraries war against one another by a divine law (and you are
yourselves witnesses that no such iniquities are committed by us, for
you forbid informations to be laid against us), it remains for you to
make inquiry concerning our life, our opinions, our loyalty and
obedience to you and your house and government, and thus at length to
grant to us the same rights (we ask nothing more) as to those who
persecute us. For we shall then conquer them, unhesitatingly
surrendering, as we now do, our very lives for the truth’s sake.

<span id="v.ii.iii-p2"></span> \[See cap. xxxi. Our Lord was “perfect
man,” yet our author resents the idea of eating the flesh of one’s own
kind as worse than brutal. As to the Eucharist the inference is plain.\]

men.”
