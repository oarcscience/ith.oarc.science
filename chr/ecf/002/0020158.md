##### <span id="iv.ii.iii.xxi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXI.—Of Manetho’s Inaccuracy.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.xxi-p1"></span>And Manetho, who among the Egyptians
gave out a great deal of nonsense, and even impiously charged Moses and
the Hebrews who accompanied him with being banished from Egypt on
account of leprosy, could give no accurate chronological statement. For
when he said they were shepherds, and enemies of the Egyptians, he
uttered truth indeed, because he was forced to do so. For our
forefathers who sojourned in Egypt were truly shepherds, but not lepers.
For when they came into the land called Jerusalem, where also they
afterwards abode, it is well known how their priests, in pursuance of
the appointment of God, continued in the temple, and there healed every
disease, so that they cured lepers and every unsoundness. The temple was
built by Solomon the king of Judæa. And from Manetho’s own statement his
chronological error is manifest. (As it is also in respect of the king
who expelled them, Pharaoh by name. For he no longer ruled them. For
having pursued the Hebrews, he and his army were engulphed in the Red
Sea. And he is in error still further, in saying that the shepherds made
war against the Egyptians.) For they went out of Egypt, and thenceforth
dwelt in the country now called Judæa, 313 <span
id="fr_679"></span>[680](#fn_679) years before Danaus came to Argos. And
that most people consider him older than any other of the Greeks is
manifest. So that Manetho has unwillingly declared to us, by his own
writings, two particulars of the truth: first, avowing that they were
shepherds; secondly, saying that they went out of the land of Egypt. So
that even from these writings Moses and his followers are proved to be
900 or even 1000 years prior to the Trojan war. <span
