##### <span id="v.iii.xxii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXII.—Continuation of the Argument.

<span id="v.iii.xxii-p1"></span>In addition to what has been said, is it
not absurd that, while we cannot even have the notion of virtue and vice
as existing separately in the soul (for we recognise the virtues as
man’s virtues, even as in like manner vice, their opposite, as not
belonging to the soul in separation from the body, and existing by
itself), yet that the reward or punishment for these should be assigned
to the soul alone? How can any one have even the notion of courage or
fortitude as existing in the soul alone, when it has no fear of death,
or wounds, or maiming, or loss, or maltreatment, or of the pain
connected with these, or the suffering resulting from them? And what
shall we say of self-control and temperance, when there is no desire
drawing it to food or sexual intercourse, or other pleasures and
enjoyments, nor any other thing soliciting it from within or exciting it
from without? And what of practical wisdom, when things are not proposed
to it which may or may not be done, nor things to be chosen or avoided,
or rather when there is in it no motion at all or natural impulse
towards the doing of anything? And how in any sense can equity be an
attribute of souls, either in reference to one another or to anything
else, whether of the same or of a different kind, when they are not able
from any source, or by any means, or in any way, to bestow that which is
equal according to merit or according to analogy, with the exception of
the honour rendered to God, and, moreover, have no impulse or motion
towards the use of their own things, or abstinence from those of others,
since the use of those things which are according to nature, or the
abstinence from them, is considered in reference to those who are so
constituted as to use them, whereas the soul neither wants anything, nor
is so constituted as to use any things or any single thing, and
therefore what is called the independent action of the parts cannot be
found in the soul so constituted?
