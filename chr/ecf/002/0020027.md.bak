#### <span id="ii.iv.v-p0.1"></span>Similitude Fifth.

##### <span id="ii.iv.v-p0.2"></span>Of True Fasting and Its Reward: Also of Purity of Body.

##### <span id="ii.iv.v-p0.3"></span>Chap. I.

<span id="ii.iv.v-p1"></span>While fasting and sitting on a certain
mountain, and giving thanks to the Lord for all His dealings with me, I
see the Shepherd sitting down beside me, and saying, “Why have you come
hither \[so\] early in the morning?” “Because, sir,” I answered, “I have
a station.” <span id="fr_262"></span>[263](#fn_262.md) “What is a station?”
he asked. “I am fasting, sir,” I replied. “What is this fasting,” he
continued, “which you are observing?” “As I have been accustomed, sir,”
I reply, “so I fast.” “You do not know,” he says, “how to fast unto the
Lord: this useless fasting which you observe to <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.v-p2.1"></span>Him</span> is of no value.” “Why, sir,” I
answered, “do you say this?” “I say to you,” he continued, “that the
fasting which you think you observe is not a fasting. But I will teach
you what is a full and acceptable fasting to the Lord. Listen,” he
continued: “God does not desire such an empty fasting. <span
id="fr_263"></span>[264](#fn_263.md) For fasting to God in this way you
will do nothing for a righteous life; but offer to God a fasting of the
following kind: Do no evil in your life, and serve the Lord with a pure
heart: keep His commandments, walking in His precepts, and let no evil
desire arise in your heart; and believe in God. If you do these things,
and fear Him, and abstain from every evil thing, you will live unto God;
and if you do these things, you will keep a great fast, and one
acceptable before God.”

##### <span id="ii.iv.v-p3.1"></span>Chap. II.

<span id="ii.iv.v-p4"></span>“Hear the similitude which I am about to
narrate to you relative to fasting. A certain man had a field and many
slaves, and he planted a certain part of the field with a
vineyard, <span id="fr_264"></span>[265](#fn_264.md) and selecting a
faithful and beloved and much valued slave, he called him to him, and
said, ‘Take <span id="page_34">p. 34</span> <span
id="ii.iv.v-Page_34"></span>this vineyard which I have planted, and
stake <span id="fr_265"></span>[266](#fn_265.md) it until I come, and do
nothing else to the vineyard; and attend to this order of mine, and you
shall receive your freedom from me.’ And the master of the slave
departed to a foreign country. And when he was gone, the slave took and
staked the vineyard; and when he had finished the staking of the vines,
he saw that the vineyard was full of weeds. He then reflected, saying,
‘I have kept this order of my master: I will dig up the rest of this
vineyard, and it will be more beautiful when dug up; and being free of
weeds, it will yield more fruit, not being choked by them.’ He took,
therefore, and dug up the vineyard, and rooted out all the weeds that
were in it. And that vineyard became very beautiful and fruitful, having
no weeds to choke it. And after a certain time the master of the slave
and of the field returned, and entered into the vineyard. And seeing
that the vines were suitably supported on stakes, and the ground,
moreover, dug up, and all the weeds rooted out, and the vines fruitful,
he was greatly pleased with the work of his slave. And calling his
beloved son who was his heir, and his friends who were his councillors,
he told them what orders he had given his slave, and what he had found
performed. And they rejoiced along with the slave at the testimony which
his master bore to him. And he said to them, ‘I promised this slave
freedom if he obeyed the command which I gave him; and he has kept my
command, and done besides a good work to the vineyard, and has pleased
me exceedingly. In return, therefore, for the work which he has done, I
wish to make him co-heir with my son, because, having good thoughts, he
did not neglect them, but carried them out.’ With this resolution of the
master his son and friends were well pleased, viz., that the slave
should be co-heir with the son. After a few days the master made a
feast, <span id="fr_266"></span>[267](#fn_266.md) and sent to his slave
many dishes from his table. And the slave receiving the dishes that were
sent him from his master, took of them what was sufficient for himself,
and distributed the rest among his fellow-slaves. And his fellow-slaves
rejoiced to receive the dishes, and began to pray for him, that he might
find still greater favour with his master for having so treated them.
His master heard all these things that were done, and was again greatly
pleased with his conduct. And the master again calling together his
friends and his son, reported to them the slave’s proceeding with regard
to the dishes which he had sent him. And they were still more satisfied
that the slave should become co-heir with his son.”

##### <span id="ii.iv.v-p7.1"></span>Chap. III.

<span id="ii.iv.v-p8"></span>I said to him, “Sir, I do not see the
meaning of these similitudes, nor am I able to comprehend them, unless
you explain them to me.” “I will explain them all to you,” he said, “and
whatever I shall mention in the course of our conversations I will show
you. \[Keep the commandments of the Lord, and you will be approved, and
inscribed amongst the number of those who observe His commands.\] And if
you do any good beyond what is commanded by God, <span
id="fr_267"></span>[268](#fn_267.md) you will gain for yourself more
abundant glory, and will be more honoured by God than you would
otherwise be. If, therefore, in keeping the commandments of God, you do,
in addition, these services, you will have joy if you observe them
according to my command.” I said to him, “Sir, whatsoever you enjoin
upon me I will observe, for I know that you are with me.” “I will be
with you,” he replied, “because you have such a desire for doing good;
and I will be with all those,” he added, “who have such a desire. This
fasting,” he continued, “is very good, provided the commandments of the
Lord be observed. Thus, then, shall you observe the fasting which you
intend to keep. <span id="fr_268"></span>[269](#fn_268.md) First of
all, <span id="fr_269"></span>[270](#fn_269.md) be on your guard against
every evil word, and every evil desire, and purify your heart from all
the vanities of this world. If you guard against these things, your
fasting will be perfect. And you will do also as follows. <span
id="fr_270"></span>[271](#fn_270.md) Having fulfilled what is written, in
the day on which you fast you will taste nothing but bread and water;
and having reckoned up the price of the dishes of that day which you
intended to have eaten, you will give it to a widow, or an orphan, or to
some person in want, and thus you will exhibit humility of mind, so that
he who has received benefit from your humility may fill his own soul,
and pray for you to the Lord. If you observe fasting, as I have
commanded you, your sacrifice <span id="page_35">p. 35</span> <span
id="ii.iv.v-Page_35"></span>will be acceptable to God, and this fasting
will be written down; and the service thus performed is noble, and
sacred, and acceptable to the Lord. These things, therefore, shall you
thus observe with your children, and all your house, and in observing
them you will be blessed; and as many as hear these words and observe
them shall be blessed; and whatsoever they ask of the Lord they shall
receive.”

##### <span id="ii.iv.v-p12.2"></span>Chap. IV.

<span id="ii.iv.v-p13"></span>I prayed him much that he would explain to
me the similitude of the field, and of the master of the vineyard, and
of the slave who staked the vineyard, and of the sakes, and of the weeds
that were plucked out of the vineyard, and of the son, and of the
friends who were fellow-councillors, for I knew that all these things
were a kind of parable. And he answered me, and said, “You are
exceedingly persistent <span id="fr_271"></span>[272](#fn_271.md) with your
questions. You ought not,” he continued, “to ask any questions at all;
for if it is needful to explain anything, it will be made known to you.”
I said to him, “Sir, whatsoever you show me, and do not explain, I shall
have seen to no purpose, not understanding its meaning. In like manner,
also, if you speak parables to me, and do not unfold them, I shall have
heard your words in vain.” And he answered me again, saying, “Every one
who is the servant of God, and has his Lord in his heart, asks of Him
understanding, and receives it, and opens up every parable; and the
words of the Lord become known to him which are spoken in
parables. <span id="fr_272"></span>[273](#fn_272.md) But those who are weak
and slothful in prayer, hesitate to ask anything from the Lord; but the
Lord is full of compassion, and gives without fail to all who ask Him.
But you, having been strengthened by the holy Angel, <span
id="fr_273"></span>[274](#fn_273.md) and having obtained from Him such
intercession, and not being slothful, why do not you ask of the Lord
understanding, and receive it from Him?” I said to him, “Sir, having you
with me, I am necessitated to ask questions of you, for you show me all
things, and converse with me; but if I were to see or hear these things
without you, I would then ask the Lord to explain them.”

##### <span id="ii.iv.v-p16.2"></span>Chap. V.

<span id="ii.iv.v-p17"></span>“I said to you a little ago,” he answered,
“that you were cunning and obstinate in asking explanations of the
parables; but since you are so persistent, I shall unfold to you the
meaning of the similitudes of the field, and of all the others that
follow, that you may make them known to every one. <span
id="fr_274"></span>[275](#fn_274.md) Hear now,” he said, “and understand
them. The field is this world; and the Lord of the field is He who
created, and perfected, and strengthened all things; \[and the son is
the Holy Spirit; <span id="fr_275"></span>[276](#fn_275.md) \] and the
slave is the Son of God; and the vines are this people, whom He Himself
planted; and the stakes are the holy angels of the Lord, who keep His
people together; and the weeds that were plucked out of the vineyard are
the iniquities of God’s servants; and the dishes which He sent Him from
His table are the commandments which He gave His people through His Son;
and the friends and fellow-councillors are the holy angels who were
first created; and the Master’s absence from home is the time that
remains until His appearing.” I said to him, “Sir, all these are great,
and marvellous, and glorious things. Could I, therefore,” I continued,
“understand them? No, nor could any other man, even if exceedingly wise.
Moreover,” I added, “explain to me what I am about to ask you.” “Say
what you wish,” he replied. “Why, sir,” I asked, “is the Son of God in
the parable in the form of a slave?”

##### <span id="ii.iv.v-p19.1"></span>Chap. VI.

<span id="ii.iv.v-p20"></span>“Hear,” he answered: “the Son of God is
not in the form <span id="fr_276"></span>[277](#fn_276.md) of a slave, but
in great power and might.” “How so, sir?” I said; “I do not understand.”
“Because,” he answered, “God planted the vineyard, that is to say, He
created the people, and gave them to His Son; and the Son appointed His
angels over them to keep them; and He Himself purged away their sins,
having suffered many trials and undergone many labours, for no one is
able to dig without labour and toil. He Himself, then, having purged
away the sins of the people, showed them the paths of life <span
id="fr_277"></span>[278](#fn_277.md) by giving them the law which He
received from His Father. \[You see,” he said, “that He is the Lord of
the people, having received all authority from His Father. <span
id="fr_278"></span>[279](#fn_278.md) \] And why the Lord took His Son as
councillor, and the glorious angels, regarding the heirship of the
slave, listen. The holy, pre-existent Spirit, that created every
creature, God made to dwell in flesh, which He chose. <span
id="fr_279"></span>[280](#fn_279.md) This flesh, accordingly, in which the
Holy Spirit dwelt, was nobly subject to that Spirit, walking religiously
<span id="page_36">p. 36</span> <span id="ii.iv.v-Page_36"></span>and
chastely, in no respect defiling the Spirit; and accordingly, after
living <span id="fr_280"></span>[281](#fn_280.md) excellently and purely,
and after labouring and co-operating with the Spirit, and having in
everything acted vigorously and courageously along with the Holy Spirit,
He assumed it as a partner with it. For this conduct <span
id="fr_281"></span>[282](#fn_281.md) of the flesh pleased Him, because it
was not defiled on the earth while having the Holy Spirit. He took,
therefore, as fellow-councillors His Son and the glorious angels, in
order that this flesh, which had been subject to the body without a
fault, might have some place of tabernacle, and that it might not appear
that the reward \[of its servitude had been lost <span
id="fr_282"></span>[283](#fn_282.md) \], for the flesh that has been found
without spot or defilement, in which the Holy Spirit dwelt, \[will
receive a reward <span id="fr_283"></span>[284](#fn_283.md) \]. You have
now the explanation <span id="fr_284"></span>[285](#fn_284.md) of this
parable also.”

##### <span id="ii.iv.v-p29.1"></span>Chap. VII.

<span id="ii.iv.v-p30"></span>“I rejoice, sir,” I said, “to hear this
explanation.” “Hear,” again he replied: “Keep this flesh pure and
stainless, that the Spirit which inhabits it may bear witness to it, and
your flesh may be justified. See that the thought never arise in your
mind that this flesh of yours is corruptible, and you misuse it by any
act of defilement. If you defile your flesh, you will also defile the
Holy Spirit; and if you defile your flesh \[and spirit\], you will not
live.” <span id="fr_285"></span>[286](#fn_285.md) “And if any one, sir,” I
said, “has been hitherto ignorant, before he heard these words, how can
such a man be saved who has defiled his flesh?” “Respecting former
sins <span id="fr_286"></span>[287](#fn_286.md) of ignorance,” he said,
“God alone is able to heal them, for to Him belongs all power. \[But be
on your guard now, and the all-powerful and compassionate God will heal
former transgressions <span id="fr_287"></span>[288](#fn_287.md) \], if for
the time to come you defile not your body nor your spirit; for both are
common, and cannot be defiled, the one without the other: keep both
therefore pure, and you will live unto God.”

<span id="ii.iv.v-p9"></span> \[To read into this passage the idea of
“supererogatory merit” is an unpardonable anachronism. (Compare Command.
iv. 4.) The writer everywhere denies human merit, extols mercy, and
imputes good works to grace. He has in view St. Paul’s advice ([1 Cor.
vii. 25-28](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#025.md)<span

evil report, and purify your heart from every defilement and revenge,
and base covetousness. And on the day on which you fast, be content with
bread, and herbs, and water, giving thanks to God. And having calculated
the amount of the cost of the meal which you intended to have eaten on
that day, give it to a widow, or an orphan, or to some one in want, so
that, having clearly filled his own soul, he shall pray to the Lord on
your behalf. If you therefore perform your fasting as I enjoined you,
your sacrifice will be acceptable before the Lord, and inscribed in the
heavens in the day of the requital of the good things that have been
prepared for the righteous.”

id="ii.iv.v-p23.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iv.v-p24"></span> This passage varies in each of the forms
in which it has come down, and is corrupt in most, if not in all. The
Vatican (Lat.) has, “Because the messenger hears the Holy Spirit, which
was the first of all that was poured (*infusus*) into a body in which
God might dwell. For understanding (intellectus) placed it in a body as
seemed proper to Him.” The Pal. reads: “For that Holy Spirit which was
created pure \[first\] of all in a body in which it might dwell, God
made and appointed a chosen body which pleased Him.” The Æth. reads:
“The Holy Spirit, who created all things, dwelt in a body in which He
wished to dwell.” \[See Grabe’s collation and emendation here, in Wake’s
translation.\]

<span id="fn_280"></span>[36:281](0020027.htm#fr_280.md) <span
id="ii.iv.v-p24.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iv.v-p25"></span> The Vatican renders this sentence: “This
body, therefore, into which the Holy Spirit was led, was subject to that
Spirit, walking rightly, modestly, and chastely, and did not at all
defile that Spirit. Since, then, that body had always obeyed the Holy
Spirit, and had laboured rightly and chastely with it, and had not at
any time given way, that wearied body passed its time as a slave; but
having strongly approved itself along with the Holy Spirit, it was
received unto God.” The Palatine is similar. The Æth. reads: “That body
served well in righteousness and purity, nor did it ever defile that
Spirit, and it became His partner, since that body pleased God.”

explanation itself needs to be explained, let him attribute it to the
confused and inaccurate state of the text. Grabe says emphatically, that
“the created Spirit of Christ as a man and not the Holy Ghost, the third
person of the Trinity,” is spoken of in this chapter chiefly. The
apparent confusion of words and phrases must be the result of ignorant
copying. It is a sufficient answer to certain German critics to cite the
providential approval of Athanasius, a fact of the utmost moment. Nobody
doubts that Athanasius was sensitive to any discoloration of the Nicene
Faith. In the text of Hermas, therefore, as it was in his copy, there
could have been nothing heretical, or favouring heresy. That Hermas was
an *artist*, and purposely gave his fiction a very primitive air, is
evident. He fears to name the Scriptures he quoted, lest any one should
doubt their use, in the days of Clement, in the Western churches.\]
