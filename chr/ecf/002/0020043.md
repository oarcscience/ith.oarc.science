##### <span id="iii.ii.vii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VII.—Concerning the Fall of Man.

<span id="iii.ii.vii-p1"></span>For the heavenly Logos, a spirit
emanating from the Father and a Logos from the Logos-power, in imitation
of the Father who begat Him made man an image of immortality, so that,
as incorruption is with God, in like manner, man, sharing in a part of
God, might have the immortal principle also. The Logos, <span
id="fr_439"></span>[440](#fn_439.md) too, before the creation of men, was
the Framer of angels. And each of these two orders of creatures was made
free to act as it pleased, not having the nature of good, which again is
with God alone, but is brought to perfection in men through their
freedom of choice, in order that the bad man may be justly punished,
having become depraved through his own fault, but the just man be
deservedly praised for his virtuous deeds, since in the exercise of his
free choice he refrained from transgressing the will of God. Such is the
constitution of things in reference to angels and men. And the power of
the Logos, having in itself a faculty to foresee future events, not as
<span id="page_68">p. 68</span> <span
id="iii.ii.vii-Page_68"></span>fated, but as taking place by the choice
of free agents, foretold from time to time the issues of things to come;
it also became a forbidder of wickedness by means of prohibitions, and
the encomiast of those who remained good. And, when men attached
themselves to one who was more subtle than the rest, having regard to
his being the first-born, <span id="fr_440"></span>[441](#fn_440.md) and
declared him to be God, though he was resisting the law of God, then the
power of the Logos excluded the beginner of the folly and his adherents
from all fellowship with Himself. And so he who was made in the likeness
of God, since the more powerful spirit is separated from him, becomes
mortal; but that first-begotten one through his transgression and
ignorance becomes a demon; and they who imitated him, that is his
illusions, are become a host of demons, and through their freedom of
choice have been given up to their own infatuation.
