##### <span id="ii.iv.iv-p0.2"></span>As in Summer Living Trees are Distinguished from Withered by Fruit and Living Leaves, So in the World to Come the Just Differ from the Unjust in Happiness.

<span id="ii.iv.iv-p1"></span>He showed me again many trees, some
budding, and others withered. And he said to me, “Do you see these
trees?” “I see, sir,” I replied, “some putting forth buds, and others
withered.” “Those,” he said, “which are budding are the righteous who
are to live in the world to come; for the coming world is the
summer <span id="fr_259"></span>[260](#fn_259.md) of the righteous, but the
winter of sinners. When, therefore, the mercy of the Lord shines forth,
then shall they be made manifest who are the servants of God, and all
men shall be made manifest. For as in summer the fruits of each
individual tree appear, and it is ascertained of what sort they are, so
also the fruits of the righteous shall be manifest, and all who have
been fruitful in that world shall be made known. <span
id="fr_260"></span>[261](#fn_260.md) But the heathen and sinners, like the
withered trees which you saw, will be found to be those who have been
withered and unfruitful in that world, and shall be burnt as wood, and
\[so\] made manifest, because their actions were evil during their
lives. For the sinners shall be consumed because they sinned and did not
repent, and the heathen shall be burned because they knew not Him who
created them. Do you therefore bear fruit, that in that summer your
fruit may be known. And refrain from much business, and you will never
sin: for they who are occupied with much business commit also many sins,
being distracted about their affairs, and not at all serving their
Lord. <span id="fr_261"></span>[262](#fn_261.md) How, then,” he continued,
“can such a one ask and obtain anything from the Lord, if he serve Him
not? They who serve Him shall obtain their requests, but they who serve
Him not shall receive nothing. And in the performance even of a single
action a man can serve the Lord; for his mind will not be perverted from
the Lord, but he will serve Him, having a pure mind. If, therefore, you
do these things, you shall be able to bear fruit for the life to come.
And every one who will do these things shall bear fruit.”
