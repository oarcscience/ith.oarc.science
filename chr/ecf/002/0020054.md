##### <span id="iii.ii.xviii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.—They Deceive, Instead of Healing.

<span id="iii.ii.xviii-p1"></span>But medicine and everything included
in it is an invention of the same kind. If any one is healed by matter,
through trusting to it, much more will he be healed by having recourse
to the power of God. As noxious preparations are material compounds, so
are curatives of the same nature. If, however, we reject the baser
matter, some persons often endeavour to heal by a union of one of these
bad things with some other, and will make use of the bad to attain the
good. But, just as he who dines with a robber, though he may not be a
robber himself, partakes of the punishment on account of his intimacy
with him, so he who is not bad but associates with the bad, having
dealings with them for some supposed good, will be punished by God the
Judge for partnership in the same object. Why is he who trusts in the
system of matter <span id="fr_475"></span>[476](#fn_475) not willing to
trust in God? For what reason do you not approach the more powerful
Lord, but rather seek to cure yourself, like the dog with grass, or the
stag with a viper, or the hog with river-crabs, or the lion with apes?
Why you deify the objects of nature? And why, when you cure your
neighbour, are you called a benefactor? Yield to the power of the Logos!
The demons do not cure, but by their art make men their captives. And
the most admirable Justin <span id="fr_476"></span>[477](#fn_476) has
rightly denounced them as robbers. For, as it is the practice of some to
capture persons and then to restore them to their friends for a ransom,
so those who are esteemed gods, invading the bodies of certain persons,
and producing a sense of their presence by dreams, command them to come
forth into public, and in the sight of all, when they have taken their
fill of the things of this world, fly away from the sick, and,
destroying the disease which they had produced, restore men to their
former state.
