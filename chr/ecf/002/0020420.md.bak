##### <span id="vi.iv.vii.x-p0.1"></span>Chapter X.—Steps to Perfection.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.x-p1"></span>For knowledge (*gnosis*), to speak
generally, a perfecting of man as man, is consummated by acquaintance
with divine things, in character, life, and word, accordant and
conformable to itself and to the divine Word. For by it faith is
perfected, inasmuch as it is solely by it that the believer becomes
perfect. Faith is an internal good, and without searching for God,
confesses His existence, and glorifies Him as existent. Whence by
starting from this faith, and being developed by it, through the grace
of God, the knowledge respecting Him is to be acquired as far as
possible.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.x-p2"></span>Now we assert that knowledge (*gnosis*)
differs from the wisdom (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.vii.x-p2.1"></span>σοφία</span>), which is the result of
teaching. For as far as anything is knowledge, so far is it certainly
wisdom; but in as far as aught is wisdom, it is not certainly knowledge.
For the term wisdom appears only in the knowledge of the uttered word.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.x-p3"></span>But it is not doubting in reference to
God, but believing, that is the foundation of knowledge. But Christ is
both the foundation and the superstructure, by whom are both the
beginning and the ends. And the extreme points, the beginning and the
end—I mean faith and love—are not taught. But knowledge, conveyed from
<span id="page_539">p. 539</span> <span
id="vi.iv.vii.x-Page_539"></span>communication through the grace of God
as a deposit, is entrusted to those who show themselves worthy of it;
and from it the worth of love beams forth from light to light. For it is
said, “To him that hath shall be given:” <span
id="fr_3588"></span>[3589](#fn_3588.md) to faith, knowledge; and to
knowledge, love; and to love, the inheritance.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.x-p5"></span>And this takes place, whenever one
hangs on the Lord by faith, by knowledge, by love, and ascends along
with Him to where the God and guard of our faith and love is. Whence at
last (on account of the necessity for very great preparation and
previous training in order both to hear what is said, and for the
composure of life, and for advancing intelligently to a point beyond the
righteousness of the law) it is that knowledge is committed to those fit
and selected for it. It leads us to the endless and perfect end,
teaching us beforehand the future life that we shall lead, according to
God, and with gods; after we are freed from all punishment and penalty
which we undergo, in consequence of our sins, for salutary discipline.
After which redemption the reward and the honours are assigned to those
who have become perfect; when they have got done with purification, and
ceased from all service, though it be holy service, and among saints.
Then become pure in heart, and near to the Lord, there awaits them
restoration to everlasting contemplation; and they are called by the
appellation of gods, being destined to sit on thrones with the other
gods that have been first put in their places by the Saviour.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.x-p6"></span>Knowledge is therefore quick in
purifying, and fit for that acceptable transformation to the better.
Whence also with ease it removes \[the soul\] to what is akin to the
soul, divine and holy, and by its own light conveys man through the
mystic stages of advancement; till it restores the pure in heart to the
crowning place of rest; teaching to gaze on God, face to face, with
knowledge and comprehension. For in this consists the perfection of the
gnostic soul, in its being with the Lord, where it is in immediate
subjection to Him, after rising above all purification and service.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.x-p7"></span>Faith is then, so to speak, a
comprehensive knowledge of the essentials; <span
id="fr_3589"></span>[3590](#fn_3589.md) and knowledge is the strong and
sure demonstration of what is received by faith, built upon faith by the
Lord’s teaching, conveying \[the soul\] on to infallibility, science,
and comprehension. And, in my view, the first saving change is that from
heathenism to faith, as I said before; and the second, that from faith
to knowledge. And the latter terminating in love, thereafter gives the
loving to the loved, that which knows to that which is known. And,
perchance, such an one has already attained the condition of “being
equal to the angels.” <span id="fr_3590"></span>[3591](#fn_3590.md)
Accordingly, after the highest excellence in the flesh, changing always
duly to the better, he urges his flight to the ancestral hall, through
the holy septenniad \[of heavenly abodes\] to the Lord’s own mansion; to
be a light, steady, and continuing eternally, entirely and in every part
immutable.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.x-p10"></span>The first mode of the Lord’s operation
mentioned by us is an exhibition of the recompense resulting from piety.
Of the very great number of testimonies that there are, I shall adduce
one, thus summarily expressed by the prophet David: “Who shall ascend to
the hill of the <span class="sc"><span
id="vi.iv.vii.x-p10.1"></span>Lord</span>, or who shall stand in His
holy place? He who is guiltless in his hands, and pure in his heart; who
hath not lifted up his soul to vanity, or sworn deceitfully to his
neighbour. He shall receive blessing from the <span class="sc"><span
id="vi.iv.vii.x-p10.2"></span>Lord</span>, and mercy from God his
Saviour. This is the generation of them that seek the Lord, that seek
the face of the God of Jacob.” <span
id="fr_3591"></span>[3592](#fn_3591.md) The prophet has, in my opinion,
concisely indicated the Gnostic. David, as appears, has cursorily
demonstrated the Saviour to be God, by calling Him “the face of the God
of Jacob,” who preached and taught concerning the Spirit. Wherefore also
the apostle designates as “the express image (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.vii.x-p11.2"></span>χαρακτῆρα</span>) of the glory of the
Father” <span id="fr_3592"></span>[3593](#fn_3592.md) the Son, who taught
the truth respecting God, and expressed the fact that the Almighty is
the one and only God and Father, “whom no man knoweth but the Son, and
he to whom the Son shall reveal Him.” <span
id="fr_3593"></span>[3594](#fn_3593.md) That God is one is intimated by
those “who seek the face of the God of Jacob;” whom being the only God,
our Saviour and God characterizes as the Good Father. And “the
generation of those that seek Him” is the elect race, devoted to inquiry
after knowledge. Wherefore also the apostle says, “I shall profit you
nothing, unless I speak to you, either by revelation, or by knowledge,
or by prophecy, or by doctrine.” <span
id="fr_3594"></span>[3595](#fn_3594.md)

<span id="vi.iv.vii.x-p15"></span>Although even by those who are not
Gnostics some things are done rightly, yet not according to reason; as
in the case of fortitude. For some who are naturally high-spirited, and
have afterwards without reason fostered this disposition, rush to many
things, and act like brave men, so as sometimes to succeed in achieving
the same things; just as endurance is easy for mechanics. But it is not
from the same cause, or with the same object; not were they to give
their whole body. “For they have not love,” according to the
apostle. <span id="fr_3595"></span>[3596](#fn_3595.md)

<span id="page_540">p. 540</span> <span
id="vi.iv.vii.x-Page_540"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.vii.x-p17"></span>All the action, then, of a man
possessed of knowledge is right action; and that done by a man not
possessed of knowledge is wrong action, though he observe a plan; since
it is not from reflection that he acts bravely, nor does he direct his
action in those things which proceed from virtue to virtue, to any
useful purpose.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.x-p18"></span>The same holds also with the other
virtues. So too the analogy is preserved in religion. Our Gnostic, then,
not only is such in reference to holiness; but corresponding to the
piety of knowledge are the commands respecting the rest of the conduct
of life. For it is our purpose at present to describe the life of the
Gnostic, <span id="fr_3596"></span>[3597](#fn_3596.md) not to present the
system of dogmas, which we shall afterwards explain at the fitting time,
preserving the order of topics.
