##### <span id="iii.ii.xiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIII.—Theory of the Soul’s Immortality.

<span id="iii.ii.xiii-p1"></span>The soul is not in itself immortal, O
Greeks, but mortal. <span id="fr_460"></span>[461](#fn_460) Yet it is
possible for it not to die. If, indeed, it knows not the truth, it dies,
and is dissolved with the body, but rises again at last at the end of
the world with the body, receiving death by punishment in immortality.
But, again, if it acquires the knowledge of God, it dies not, although
for a time it be dissolved. In itself it is darkness, and there is
nothing luminous in it. And this is the meaning of the saying, “The
darkness comprehendeth not the light.” <span
id="fr_461"></span>[462](#fn_461) For the soul does not preserve the
spirit, but is preserved by it, and the light comprehends the darkness.
The Logos, in truth, is the light of God, but the ignorant soul is
darkness. On this account, if it continues solitary, it tends downward
towards matter, and dies with the flesh; but, if it enters into union
with the Divine Spirit, <span id="page_71">p. 71</span> <span
id="iii.ii.xiii-Page_71"></span>it is no longer helpless, but ascends to
the regions whither the Spirit guides it: for the dwelling-place of the
spirit is above, but the origin of the soul is from beneath. Now, in the
beginning the spirit was a constant companion of the soul, but the
spirit forsook it because it was not willing to follow. Yet, retaining
as it were a spark of its power, though unable by reason of the
separation to discern the perfect, while seeking for God it fashioned to
itself in its wandering many gods, following the sophistries of the
demons. But the Spirit of God is not with all, but, taking up its abode
with those who live justly, and intimately combining with the soul, by
prophecies it announced hidden things to other souls. And the souls that
are obedient to wisdom have attracted to themselves the cognate
spirit; <span id="fr_462"></span>[463](#fn_462) but the disobedient,
rejecting the minister of the suffering God, <span
id="fr_463"></span>[464](#fn_463) have shown themselves to be fighters
against God, rather than His worshippers.
