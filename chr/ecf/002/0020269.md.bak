##### <span id="vi.iii.ii.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.—On Laughter.

<span id="vi.iii.ii.v-p1"></span>People who are imitators of ludicrous
sensations, or rather of such as deserve derision, are to be driven from
our polity. <span id="fr_1415"></span>[1416](#fn_1415.md)

<span id="vi.iii.ii.v-p3"></span>For since all forms of speech flow from
mind and manners, ludicrous expressions could not be uttered, did they
not proceed from ludicrous practices. For the saying, “It is not a good
tree which produces corrupt fruit, nor a corrupt tree which produces
good fruit,” <span id="fr_1416"></span>[1417](#fn_1416.md) is to be applied
in this case. For speech is the fruit of the mind. If, then, wags are to
be ejected from our society, we ourselves must by no manner of means be
allowed to stir up laughter. For it were absurd to be found imitators of
things of which we are prohibited to be listeners; and still more absurd
for a man to set about making himself a laughing-stock, that is, the
butt of insult and derision. For if we could not endure to make a
ridiculous figure, such as we see some do in processions, how could we
with any propriety bear to have the inner man made a ridiculous figure
of, and that to one’s face? Wherefore we ought never of our own accord
to assume a ludicrous character. And how, then, can we devote ourselves
to being and appearing ridiculous <span id="page_250">p. 250</span>
<span id="vi.iii.ii.v-Page_250"></span>in our conversation, thereby
travestying speech, which is the most precious of all human endowments?
It is therefore disgraceful to set one’s self to do this; since the
conversation of wags of this description is not fit for our ears,
inasmuch as by the very expressions used it familiarizes us with
shameful actions. <span id="fr_1417"></span>[1418](#fn_1417.md)

<span id="vi.iii.ii.v-p6"></span>Pleasantry is allowable, not waggery.
Besides, even laughter must be kept in check; for when given vent to in
the right manner it indicates orderliness, but when it issues
differently it shows a want of restraint.

<span id="vi.iii.ii.v-p7"></span>For, in a word, whatever things are
natural to men we must not eradicate from them, but rather impose on
them limits and suitable times. For man is not to laugh on all occasions
because he is a laughing animal, any more than the horse neighs on all
occasions because he is a neighing animal. But as rational beings, we
are to regulate ourselves suitably, harmoniously relaxing the austerity
and over-tension of our serious pursuits, not inharmoniously breaking
them up altogether.

<span id="vi.iii.ii.v-p8"></span>For the seemly relaxation of the
countenance in a harmonious manner—as of a musical instrument—is called
a smile. So also is laughter on the face of well-regulated men termed.
But the discordant relaxation of countenance in the case of women is
called a giggle, and is meretricious laughter; in the case of men, a
guffaw, and is savage and insulting laughter. “A fool raises his voice
in laughter,” <span id="fr_1418"></span>[1419](#fn_1418.md) says the
Scripture; but a clever man smiles almost imperceptibly. The clever man
in this case he calls wise, inasmuch as he is differently affected from
the fool. But, on the other hand, one needs not be gloomy, only grave.
For I certainly prefer a man to smile who has a stern countenance than
the reverse; for so his laughter will be less apt to become the object
of ridicule.

<span id="vi.iii.ii.v-p10"></span>Smiling even requires to be made the
subject of discipline. If it is at what is disgraceful, we ought to
blush rather than smile, lest we seem to take pleasure in it by
sympathy; if at what is painful, it is fitting to look sad rather than
to seem pleased. For to do the former is a sign of rational human
thought; the other infers suspicion of cruelty.

<span id="vi.iii.ii.v-p11"></span>We are not to laugh perpetually, for
that is going beyond bounds; nor in the presence of elderly persons, or
others worthy of respect, unless they indulge in pleasantry for our
amusement. Nor are we to laugh before all and sundry, nor in every
place, nor to every one, nor about everything. For to children and women
especially laughter is the cause of slipping into scandal. And even to
appear stern serves to keep those about us at their distance. For
gravity can ward off the approaches of licentiousness by a mere look.
All senseless people, to speak in a word, wine

> <span id="vi.iii.ii.v-p11.1"></span> “Commands both to laugh
> luxuriously and to dance,”  

<span id="vi.iii.ii.v-p12"></span>changing effeminate manners to
softness. We must consider, too, how consequently freedom of speech
leads impropriety on to filthy speaking.

> <span id="vi.iii.ii.v-p12.1"></span> “And he uttered a word which had
> been better unsaid.” <span id="fr_1419"></span>[1420](#fn_1419.md)  

<span id="vi.iii.ii.v-p14"></span>Especially, therefore, in liquor
crafty men’s characters are wont to be seen through, stripped as they
are of their mask through the caitiff licence of intoxication, through
which reason, weighed down in the soul itself by drunkenness, is lulled
to sleep, and unruly passions are roused, which overmaster the
feebleness of the mind.
