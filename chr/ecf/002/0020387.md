##### <span id="vi.iv.v.xiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIII.—The Knowledge of God a Divine Gift, According to the Philosophers.

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiii-p1"></span>Everything, then, which falls under a
name, is originated, whether they will or not. Whether, then, the Father
Himself draws to Himself everyone who has led a pure life, and has
reached the conception of the blessed and incorruptible nature; or
whether the free-will which is in us, by reaching the knowledge of the
good, leaps and bounds over the barriers, as the gymnasts say; yet it is
not without eminent grace that the soul is winged, and soars, and is
raised above the higher spheres, laying aside all that is heavy, and
surrendering itself to its kindred element.

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiii-p2"></span>Plato, too, in *Meno*, says that
virtue is God-given, as the following expressions show: “From this
argument then, O Meno, virtue is shown to come to those, in whom it is
found, by divine providence.” Does it not then appear that “the gnostic
disposition” which has come to all is enigmatically called “divine
providence?” And he adds more explicitly: “If, then, in this whole
treatise we have investigated well, it results that virtue is neither by
nature, nor is it taught, but is produced by divine providence, not
without intelligence, in those in whom it is found.” Wisdom which is
God-given, as being the power of the Father, rouses indeed our
free-will, and admits faith, and repays the application of the elect
with its crowning fellowship.

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiii-p3"></span>And now I will adduce Plato himself,
who clearly deems it fit to believe the children of God. For,
discoursing on gods that are visible and born, in *Timæus,* he says:
“But to speak of the other demons, and to know their birth, is too much
for us. But we must credit those who have formerly spoken, they being
the offspring of the gods, as they said, and knowing well their
progenitors, although they speak without probable and necessary proofs.”
I do not think it possible that clearer testimony could be borne by the
Greeks, that our Saviour, and those anointed to prophesy (the latter
being called the sons of God, and the Lord being His own Son), are the
true witnesses respecting divine things. Wherefore also they ought to be
believed, being inspired, he added. And were one to say in a more tragic
vein, that we ought not to believe,

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiii-p3.1"></span> “For it was not Zeus that told me
> these things,”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiii-p4"></span>yet let him know that it was God
Himself that promulgated the Scriptures by His Son. And he, who
announces what is his own, is to be believed. “No one,” says the Lord,
“hath known the Father but the Son, and he to whom the Son shall reveal
Him.” <span id="fr_3097"></span>[3098](#fn_3097) This, then, is to be
believed, according to Plato, though it is announced and spoken “without
probable and necessary proofs,” but in the Old and New Testament. “For
except ye believe,” says the Lord, “ye shall die in your sins.” <span
id="fr_3098"></span>[3099](#fn_3098) And again: “He that believeth hath
everlasting life.” <span id="fr_3099"></span>[3100](#fn_3099) “Blessed
are all they that put their trust in Him.” <span
id="fr_3100"></span>[3101](#fn_3100) For trusting is more than faith.
For when one has believed <span id="fr_3101"></span>[3102](#fn_3101)
that the Son of God is our teacher, he trusts <span
id="fr_3102"></span>[3103](#fn_3102) that his teaching is true. And as
“instruction,” according to Empedocles, “makes the mind grow,” so trust
in the Lord makes faith grow.

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiii-p11"></span>We say, then, that it is
characteristic of the same persons to vilify philosophy, and run down
faith, and to praise iniquity and felicitate a libidinous life. But now
faith, if it is the voluntary assent of the soul, is still the doer of
good things, the foundation of right conduct; and if Aristotle defines
strictly when he teaches that <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.v.xiii-p11.1"></span>ποιεῖν</span> is applied to the
irrational creatures and to inanimate <span id="page_465">p. 465</span>
<span id="vi.iv.v.xiii-Page_465"></span>things, while <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.iv.v.xiii-p11.2"></span>πράττειν</span> is
applicable to men only, let him correct those who say that God is the
maker (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.v.xiii-p11.3"></span>ποιητής</span>) of the universe. And what
is done (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.v.xiii-p11.4"></span>πρακτόν</span>), he says, is as good or
as necessary. To do wrong, then, is not good, for no one does wrong
except for some other thing; and nothing that is necessary is voluntary.
To do wrong, then, is voluntary, so that it is not necessary. But the
good differ especially from the bad in inclinations and good desires.
For all depravity of soul is accompanied with want of restraint; and he
who acts from passion, acts from want of restraint and from depravity.

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiii-p12"></span>I cannot help admiring in every
particular that divine utterance: “Verily, verily, I say unto you, He
that entereth not in by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up
some other way, the same is a thief and a robber. But he that entereth
in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. To him the porter openeth.”
Then the Lord says in explanation, “I am the door of the sheep.” <span
id="fr_3103"></span>[3104](#fn_3103) Men must then be saved by learning
the truth through Christ, even if they attain philosophy. For now that
is clearly shown “which was not made known to other ages, which is now
revealed to the sons of men.” <span id="fr_3104"></span>[3105](#fn_3104)
For there was always a natural manifestation of the one Almighty God,
among all right-thinking men; and the most, who had not quite divested
themselves of shame with respect to the truth, apprehended the eternal
beneficence in divine providence. In fine, then, Xenocrates the
Chalcedonian was not quite without hope that the notion of the Divinity
existed even in the irrational creatures. And Democritus, though against
his will, will make this avowal by the consequences of his dogmas; for
he represents the same images as issuing, from the divine essence, on
men and on the irrational animals. <span
id="fr_3105"></span>[3106](#fn_3105) Far from destitute of a divine idea
is man, who, it is written in Genesis, partook of inspiration, being
endowed with a purer essence than the other animate creatures. Hence the
Pythagoreans say that mind comes to man by divine providence, as Plato
and Aristotle avow; but we assert that the Holy Spirit inspires him who
has believed. The Platonists hold that mind is an effluence of divine
dispensation in the soul, and they place the soul in the body. For it is
expressly said by Joel, one of the twelve prophets, “And it shall come
to pass after these things, I will pour out of My Spirit on all flesh,
and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy.” <span
id="fr_3106"></span>[3107](#fn_3106) But it is not as a portion of God
that the Spirit is in each of us. But how this dispensation takes place,
and what the Holy Spirit is, shall be shown by us in the books on
prophecy, and in those on the soul. But “incredulity is good at
concealing the depths of knowledge,” according to Heraclitus; “for
incredulity escapes from ignorance.”
