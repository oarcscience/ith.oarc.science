##### <span id="iii.ii.xxvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXVII.—The Christians are Hated Unjustly.

<span id="iii.ii.xxvii-p1"></span>And if you adhere to *their* teaching,
why do you fight against me for choosing such views of doctrine as I
approve? Is it not unreasonable that, while the robber is not to be
punished for the name he bears, <span id="fr_493"></span>[494](#fn_493.md)
but only when the truth about him has been clearly ascertained, yet we
are to be assailed with abuse on a judgment formed without examination?
Diagoras was an Athenian, but you punished him for divulging the
Athenian mysteries; yet you who read his Phrygian discourses hate us.
You possess the commentaries of Leo, and are displeased with our
refutations of them; and having in your hands the opinions of Apion
concerning the Egyptian gods, you denounce us as most impious. The tomb
of Olympian Zeus is shown among you, <span
id="fr_494"></span>[495](#fn_494.md) though some one says that the Cretans
are liars. <span id="fr_495"></span>[496](#fn_495.md) Your assembly of many
gods is nothing. Though their despiser Epicurus acts as a
torch-bearer, <span id="fr_496"></span>[497](#fn_496.md) I do not any the
more conceal from the rulers that view of God which I hold in relation
to His government of the universe. Why do you advise me to be false to
my principles? Why do you who say that you despise death exhort us to
use art in order to escape it? I have not the heart of a deer; but your
zeal <span id="page_77">p. 77</span> <span
id="iii.ii.xxvii-Page_77"></span>for dialectics resembles the loquacity
of Thersites. How can I believe one who tells me that the sun is a
red-hot mass and the moon an earth? Such assertions are mere
logomachies, and not a sober exposition of truth. How can it be
otherwise than foolish to credit the books of Herodotus relating to the
history of Hercules, which tell of an upper earth from which the lion
came down that was killed by Hercules? And what avails the Attic style,
the sorites of philosophers, the plausibilities of syllogisms, the
measurements of the earth, the positions of the stars, and the course of
the sun? To be occupied in such inquiries is the work of one who imposes
opinions on himself as if they were laws.
