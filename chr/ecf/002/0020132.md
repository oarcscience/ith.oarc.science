##### <span id="iv.ii.ii.xxxiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXIV.—The Prophets Enjoined Holiness of Life.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xxxiv-p1"></span>And, for the rest, would that in a
kindly spirit <span id="page_108">p. 108</span> <span
id="iv.ii.ii.xxxiv-Page_108"></span>you would investigate divine
things <span id="fr_616"></span>[617](#fn_616) —I mean the things that
are spoken by the prophets—in order that, by comparing what is said by
us with the utterances of the others, you may be able to discover the
truth. We <span id="fr_617"></span>[618](#fn_617) have shown from their
own histories, which they have compiled, that the names of those who are
called gods, are found to be the names of men who lived among them, as
we have shown above. And to this day their images are daily fashioned,
idols, “the works of men’s hands.” And these the mass of foolish men
serve, whilst they reject the maker and fashioner of all things and the
nourisher of all breath of life, giving credit to vain doctrines through
the deceitfulness of the senseless tradition received from their
fathers. But God at least, the Father and Creator of the universe, did
not abandon mankind, but gave a law, and sent holy prophets to declare
and teach the race of men, that each one of us might awake and
understand that there is one God. And they also taught us to refrain
from unlawful idolatry, and adultery, and murder, fornication, theft,
avarice, false swearing, wrath, and every incontinence and uncleanness;
and that whatever a man would not wish to be done to himself, he should
not do to another; and thus he who acts righteously shall escape the
eternal punishments, and be thought worthy of the eternal life from God.
