##### <span id="iv.ii.ii.xxiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXIV.—The Beauty of Paradise.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xxiv-p1"></span>God, then, caused to spring out of
the earth every tree that is beautiful in appearance, or good for food.
For at first there were only those things which were produced on the
third day,—plants, and seeds, and herbs; but the things which were in
Paradise were made of a <span id="page_104">p. 104</span> <span
id="iv.ii.ii.xxiv-Page_104"></span>superior loveliness and beauty, since
in it the plants were said to have been planted by God. As to the rest
of the plants, indeed, the world contained plants like them; but the two
trees,—the tree of life and the tree of knowledge,—the rest of the earth
possessed not, but only Paradise. And that Paradise is earth, and is
planted on the earth, the Scripture states, saying: <span
id="fr_598"></span>[599](#fn_598.md) “And the <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.ii.ii.xxiv-p2.2"></span>Lord</span> God planted Paradise in Eden
eastwards, and placed man there; and out of the ground made the <span
class="sc"><span id="iv.ii.ii.xxiv-p2.3"></span>Lord</span> God to grow
every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food.” By the
expressions, therefore, “out of the ground,” and “eastwards,” the holy
writing clearly teaches us that Paradise is under this heaven, under
which the east and the earth are. And the Hebrew word Eden signifies
“delight.” And it was signified that a river flowed out of Eden to water
Paradise, and after that divides into four heads; of which the two
called Pison and Gihon water the eastern parts, especially Gihon, which
encompasses the whole land of Ethiopia, and which, they say, reappears
in Egypt under the name of Nile. And the other two rivers are manifestly
recognisable by us—those called Tigris and Euphrates—for these border on
our own regions. And God having placed man in Paradise, as has been
said, to till and keep it, commanded him to eat of all the
trees,—manifestly of the tree of life also; but only of the tree of
knowledge He commanded him not to taste. And God transferred him from
the earth, out of which he had been produced, into Paradise, giving him
means of advancement, in order that, maturing and becoming perfect, and
being even declared a god, he might thus ascend into heaven in
possession of immortality. For man had been made a middle nature,
neither wholly mortal, nor altogether immortal, but capable of either;
so also the place, Paradise, was made in respect of beauty intermediate
between earth and heaven. And by the expression, “till it,” <span
id="fr_599"></span>[600](#fn_599.md) no other kind of labour is implied
than the observance of God’s command, lest, disobeying, he should
destroy himself, as indeed he did destroy himself, by sin.
