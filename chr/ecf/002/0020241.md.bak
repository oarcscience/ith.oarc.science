##### <span id="vi.ii.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.—The Opinions of the Philosophers Respecting God.

<span id="vi.ii.v-p1"></span>Let us then run over, if you choose, the
opinions of the philosophers, to which they give boastful utterance,
respecting the gods; that we may discover philosophy itself, through its
conceit making an idol of matter; although we are able to show, as we
proceed, that even while deifying certain demons, it has a dream of the
truth. The elements were designated as the first principles of all
things by some of them: by Thales of Miletus, who celebrated water, and
Anaximenes, also of Miletus, who celebrated air as the first principle
of all things, and was followed afterwards by Diogenes of Apollonia.
Parmenides of Elia introduced fire and earth as gods; one of which,
namely fire, Hippasus of Metapontum and Heraclitus of Ephesus supposed a
divinity. Empedocles of Agrigentum fell in with a multitude, and, in
addition to those four elements, enumerates disagreement and agreement.
Atheists surely these are to be reckoned, who through an unwise wisdom
worshipped matter, who did not indeed pay religious honour to stocks and
stones, but deified earth, the mother of these,—who did not make an
image of Poseidon, but revered water itself. For what else, according to
the original signification, is Poseidon, but a moist substance? the name
being derived from *posis* (drink); as, beyond doubt, the warlike Ares
is so called, from *arsis* (rising up) and *anœresis* (destroying). For
this reason mainly, I think, many fix a sword into the ground, and
sacrifice to it as to Ares. The Scythians have a practice of this
nature, as Eudoxus tells us in the second book of his *Travels*. The
Sauromatæ, too, a tribe of the Scythians, worship a sabre, as Ikesius
says in his work on *Mysteries*.

<span id="vi.ii.v-p2"></span>This was also the case with Heraclitus and
his followers, who worshipped fire as the first cause; for this fire
others named Hephæstus. The Persian Magi, too, and many of the
inhabitants of Asia, worshipped fire; and besides them, the Macedonians,
as Diogenes relates in the first book of his *Persica*. Why specify the
Sauromatæ, who are said by Nymphodorus, in his *Barbaric Customs*, to
pay sacred honours to fire? or the Persians, or the Medes, or the Magi?
These, Dino tells us, sacrifice beneath the open sky, regarding fire and
water as the only images of the gods.

<span id="vi.ii.v-p3"></span>Nor have I failed to reveal their
ignorance; for, however much they think to keep clear of error in one
form, they slide into it in another.

<span id="vi.ii.v-p4"></span>They have not supposed stocks and stones to
be images of the gods, like the Greeks; nor ibises and ichneumons, like
the Egyptians; but fire and water, as philosophers. Berosus, in the
third book of his *Chaldaics*, shows that it was after many successive
periods of years that men worshipped images of human shape, this
practice being introduced by Artaxerxes, the son of Darius, and father
of Ochus, who first set up the image of Aphrodite Anaitis at Babylon and
Susa; and Ecbatana set the example of worshipping it to the Persians;
the Bactrians, to Damascus and Sardis.

<span id="vi.ii.v-p5"></span>Let the philosophers, then, own as their
teachers the Persians, or the Sauromatæ, or the Magi, from whom they
have learned the impious doctrine of regarding as divine certain first
principles, being ignorant of the great First Cause, the Maker of all
things, and Creator of those very first principles, the unbeginning God,
but reverencing “these weak and beggarly elements,” <span
id="fr_919"></span>[920](#fn_919.md) as the apostle says, which were made
for the service of man. And of the rest of the philosophers who, passing
over the elements, have eagerly sought after something higher and
nobler, some have discanted on the Infinite, of whom were Anaximander of
Miletus, Anaxagoras of Clazomenæ, and the Athenian Archelaus, both of
whom set Mind (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ii.v-p6.2"></span>νοῦς</span>) above Infinity; while the Milesian
Leucippus and the Chian Metrodorus apparently inculcated two first
principles—fulness and vacuity. Democritus of Abdera, while accepting
these two, added to them images <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ii.v-p6.3"></span>ει ῎δωλα</span>; while Alcmæon of Crotona
supposed the stars to be gods, and endowed with life (I will not keep
silence as to their effrontery). Xenocrates of Chalcedon indicates that
the planets are seven gods, and that the universe, <span
id="page_191">p. 191</span> <span id="vi.ii.v-Page_191"></span>composed
of all these, is an eighth. Nor will I pass over those of the Porch, who
say that the Divinity pervades all matter, even the vilest, and thus
clumsily disgrace philosophy. Nor do I think will it be taken ill,
having reached this point, to advert to the Peripatetics. The father of
this sect, not knowing the Father of all things, thinks that He who is
called the Highest is the soul of the universe; that is, he supposes the
soul of the world to be God, and so is pierced by his own sword. For by
first limiting the sphere of Providence to the orbit of the moon, and
then by supposing the universe to be God, he confutes himself, inasmuch
as he teaches that that which is without God is God. And that Eresian
Theophrastus, the pupil of Aristotle, conjectures at one time heaven,
and at another spirit, to be God. Epicurus alone I shall gladly forget,
who carries impiety to its full length, and thinks that God takes no
charge of the world. What, moreover, of Heraclides of Pontus? He is
dragged everywhere to the images—the <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ii.v-p6.4"></span>εἴδωλα</span>—of Democritus.
