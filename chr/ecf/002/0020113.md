##### <span id="iv.ii.ii.xv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XV.—Of the Fourth Day.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xv-p1"></span>On the fourth day the luminaries were
made; because God, who possesses foreknowledge, knew the follies of the
vain philosophers, that they were going to say, that the things which
grow on the earth are produced from the heavenly bodies, so as to
exclude God. In order, therefore, that the truth might be obvious, the
plants and seeds were produced prior to the heavenly bodies, for what is
posterior cannot produce that which is prior. And these contain the
pattern and type of a great mystery. For the sun is a type of God, and
the moon of man. And as the sun far surpasses the moon in power and
glory, so far does God surpass man. And as the sun remains ever full,
never becoming less, so does God always abide perfect, being full of all
power, and understanding, and wisdom, and immortality, and all good. But
the moon wanes monthly, and in a manner dies, being a type of man; then
it is born again, and is crescent, for a pattern of the future
resurrection. In like manner also the <span id="page_101">p. 101</span>
<span id="iv.ii.ii.xv-Page_101"></span>three days which were before the
luminaries, <span id="fr_582"></span>[583](#fn_582.md) are types of the
Trinity, <span id="fr_583"></span>[584](#fn_583.md) of God, and His Word,
and His wisdom. <span id="fr_584"></span>[585](#fn_584.md) And the fourth
is the type of man, who needs light, that so there may be God, the Word,
wisdom, man. Wherefore also on the fourth day the lights were made. The
disposition of the stars, too, contains a type of the arrangement and
order of the righteous and pious, and of those who keep the law and
commandments of God. For the brilliant and bright stars are an imitation
of the prophets, and therefore they remain fixed, not declining, nor
passing from place to place. And those which hold the second place in
brightness, are types of the people of the righteous. And those, again,
which change their position, and flee from place to place, which also
are called planets, <span id="fr_585"></span>[586](#fn_585.md) they too are
a type of the men who have wandered from God, abandoning His law and
commandments.

word “Trinity.” It seems to have been used by this writer in his lost
works, also; and, as a learned friends suggests, the use he makes of it
is familiar. He does not lug it in as something novel: “types of the
Trinity,” he says, illustrating an accepted word, not introducing a new
one.\]

certain, that, according to the notions of Theophilus, God, His Word,
and His wisdom constitute a Trinity; and it should seem a Trinity of
persons.” He notes that the title <span class="Greek"><span

Spirit, although he himself elsewhere gives this title to the Son (book
ii. cap. x., *supra*), as is more usual with the Fathers.” Consult
Kaye’s *Justin Martyr*, p. 157. Ed. 1853.\]
