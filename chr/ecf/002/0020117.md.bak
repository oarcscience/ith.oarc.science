##### <span id="iv.ii.ii.xix-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIX.—Man is Placed in Paradise.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xix-p1"></span>God having thus completed the heavens,
and the earth, and the sea, and all that are in them, on the sixth day,
rested on the seventh day from all His works which He made. Then holy
Scripture gives a summary in these words: “This is the book of the
generation of the heavens and the earth, when they were created, in the
day that the <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.ii.ii.xix-p1.1"></span>Lord</span> made the heavens and the
earth, and every green thing of the field, before it was made, and every
herb of the field before it grew. For God had not caused it to rain upon
the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground.” <span
id="fr_587"></span>[588](#fn_587.md) By this He signifies to us, that the
whole earth was at that time watered by a divine fountain, and had no
need that man should till it; but the earth produced all things
spontaneously by the command of God, that man might not be wearied by
tilling it. But that the creation of man might be made plain, so that
there should not seem to be an insoluble problem existing among men,
since God had said, “Let Us make man;” and since His creation was not
yet plainly related, Scripture teaches us, saying: “And a fountain went
up out of the earth, and watered the face of the whole earth; and God
made man of the dust of the earth, and breathed into his face the breath
of life, and man became a living soul.” <span
id="fr_588"></span>[589](#fn_588.md) Whence also by most persons the soul
is called immortal. <span id="fr_589"></span>[590](#fn_589.md) And after
the formation of man, God chose out for him a region among the places of
the East, excellent for light, brilliant with a very bright atmosphere,
\[abundant\] in the finest plants; and in this He placed man.

\[The Hebrew must not be overlooked: “the breath of *lives*,”
*spiraculum vitarum;* on which see Bartholinus, in Delitzsch, *System of
Bib. Psychol*., p. 27. Also, Luther’s *Trichotomy, ibid.*, p. 460. With
another work of similar character I am only slightly acquainted, but,
recall with great satisfaction a partial examination of it when it first
appeared. I refer to *The Tripartite Nature of Man*, by the Rev J. B.
Heard, M.A. 3d ed. Edinburgh, 1871, T. & T. Clark.\]
