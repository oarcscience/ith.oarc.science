##### <span id="vi.iv.iv.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.—The Praises of Martyrdom.

<span id="vi.iv.iv.iv-p1"></span>Whence, as is reasonable, the gnostic,
when Galled, obeys easily, and gives up his body to him who asks; and,
previously divesting himself of the affections of this carcase, not
insulting the tempter, but rather, in my opinion, training him and
convincing him,—

> <span id="vi.iv.iv.iv-p1.1"></span> “From what honour and what extent
> of wealth fallen,”  

<span id="vi.iv.iv.iv-p2"></span>as says Empedocles, here for the future
he walks with mortals. He, in truth, bears witness to himself that he is
faithful and loyal towards God; and to the tempter, that he in vain
envied him who is faithful through love; and to the Lord, of the
inspired persuasion in reference to His doctrine, from which he will not
depart through fear of death; further, he confirms also the truth of
preaching by his deed, showing that God to whom he hastes is powerful.
You will wonder at his love, which he conspicuously shows with
thankfulness, in being united to what is allied to him, and besides by
his precious blood, shaming the unbelievers. He then avoids denying
Christ through fear by reason of the command; nor does he sell his faith
in the hope of the gifts prepared, but in love to the Lord he will most
gladly depart from this life; perhaps giving thanks both to him who
afforded the cause of his departure hence, and to him who laid the plot
against him, for receiving an honourable reason which he himself
furnished not, for showing what he is, to him by his patience, and to
the Lord in love, by which even before his birth he was manifested to
the Lord, who knew the martyr’s choice. With good courage, then, he goes
to the Lord, his friend, for whom he voluntarily gave his body, and, as
his judges hoped, his soul, hearing from our Saviour the words of
poetry, “Dear brother,” by reason of the similarity of his life. We call
martyrdom perfection, not because the man comes to the end of his life
as others, but because he has exhibited the perfect work of love. And
the ancients laud the death of those among the Greeks who died in war,
not that they advised people to die a violent death, but because he who
ends his life in war is released without the dread of dying, severed
from the body without experiencing previous suffering or being enfeebled
in his soul, as the people that suffer in diseases. For they depart
<span id="page_412">p. 412</span> <span
id="vi.iv.iv.iv-Page_412"></span>in a state of effeminacy and desiring
to live; and therefore they do not yield up the soul pure, but bearing
with it their lusts like weights of lead; all but those who have been
conspicuous in virtue. Some die in battle with their lusts, these being
in no respect different from what they would have been if they had
wasted away by disease.

<span id="vi.iv.iv.iv-p3"></span>If the confession to God is martyrdom,
each soul which has lived purely in the knowledge of God, which has
obeyed the commandments, is a witness both by life and word, in whatever
way it may be released from the body,—shedding faith as blood along its
whole life till its departure. For instance, the Lord says in the
Gospel, “Whosoever shall leave father, or mother, or brethren,” and so
forth, “for the sake of the Gospel and my name,” <span
id="fr_2695"></span>[2696](#fn_2695.md) he is blessed; not indicating
simple martyrdom, but the gnostic martyrdom, as of the man who has
conducted himself according to the rule of the Gospel, in love to the
Lord (for the knowledge of the Name and the understanding of the Gospel
point out the gnosis, but not the bare appellation), so as to leave his
worldly kindred, and wealth, and every possession, in order to lead a
life free from passion. “Mother” figuratively means country and
sustenance; “fathers” are the laws of civil polity: which must be
contemned thankfully by the high-souled just man; for the sake of being
the friend of God, and of obtaining the right hand in the holy place, as
the Apostles have done.

<span id="vi.iv.iv.iv-p5"></span>Then Heraclitus says, “Gods and men
honour those slain in battle;” and Plato in the fifth book of the
*Republic* writes, “Of those who die in military service, whoever dies
after winning renown, shall we not say that he is chief of the golden
race? Most assuredly.” But the golden race is with the gods, who are in
heaven, in the fixed sphere, who chiefly hold command in the providence
exercised towards men. Now some of the heretics who have misunderstood
the Lord, have at once an impious and cowardly love of life; saying that
the true martyrdom is the knowledge of the only true God (which we also
admit), and that the man is a self-murderer and a suicide who makes
confession by death; and adducing other similar sophisms of cowardice.
To these we shall reply at the proper time; for they differ with us in
regard to first principles. Now we, too, say that those who have rushed
on death (for there are some, not belonging to us, but sharing the name
merely, who are in haste to give themselves up, the poor wretches dying
through hatred to the Creator <span id="fr_2696"></span>[2697](#fn_2696.md)
)—these, we say, banish themselves without being martyrs, even though
they are punished publicly. For they do not preserve the characteristic
mark of believing martyrdom, inasmuch as they have not known the only
true God, but give themselves up to a vain death, as the Gymnosophists
of the Indians to useless fire.

<span id="vi.iv.iv.iv-p7"></span>But since these falsely named <span
id="fr_2697"></span>[2698](#fn_2697.md) calumniate the body, let them learn
that the harmonious mechanism of the body contributes to the
understanding which leads to goodness of nature. Wherefore in the third
book of the *Republic,* Plato, whom they appeal to loudly as an
authority that disparages generation, says, “that for the sake of
harmony of soul, care must be taken for the body,” by which, he who
announces the proclamation of the truth, finds it possible to live, and
to live well. For it is by the path of life and health that we learn
gnosis. But is he who cannot advance to the height without being
occupied with necessary things, and through them doing what tends to
knowledge, not to choose to live well? In living, then, living well is
secured. And he who in the body has devoted himself to a good life, is
being sent on to the state of immortality.
