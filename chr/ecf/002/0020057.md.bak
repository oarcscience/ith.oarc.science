##### <span id="iii.ii.xxi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXI.—Doctrines of the Christians and Greeks Respecting God Compared.

<span id="iii.ii.xxi-p1"></span>We do not act as fools, O Greeks, nor
utter idle tales, when we announce that God was born in the form of a
man. I call on you who reproach us to compare your mythical accounts
with our narrations. Athené, as they say, took the form of Deïphobus for
the sake of Hector, <span id="fr_482"></span>[483](#fn_482.md) and the
unshorn Phoœbus for the sake of Admetus fed the trailing-footed oxen,
and the spouse us came as an old woman to Semele. But, while you treat
seriously such things, how can you deride us? Your Asclepios died, and
he who ravished fifty virgins in one night at Thespiæ lost his life by
delivering himself to the devouring flame. Prometheus, fastened to
Caucasus, suffered punishment for his good deeds to men. According to
you, Zeus is envious, and hides the dream <span
id="fr_483"></span>[484](#fn_483.md) from men, wishing their destruction.
Wherefore, looking at your own memorials, vouchsafe us your approval,
though it were only as dealing in legends similar to your own. We,
however, do not deal in folly, but your legends are only idle tales. If
you speak of the origin of the gods, you also declare them to be mortal.
For what reason is Hera now never pregnant? Has she grown old? or is
there no one to give you information? Believe me now, O Greeks, and do
not resolve your myths and gods into allegory. If you attempt to do
this, the divine nature as held by you is overthrown by your own selves;
for, if the demons with you are such as they are said to be, they are
worthless as to character; or, if regarded as symbols of the powers of
nature, they are not what they are called. But I cannot be persuaded to
pay religious homage to the natural elements, nor can I undertake to
persuade my neighbour. And Metrodorus of Lampsacus, in his treatise
concerning Homer, has argued very foolishly, turning everything into
allegory. For he says that neither Hera, nor Athené, nor Zeus are what
those persons suppose who consecrate to them sacred enclosures and
groves, but parts of nature and certain arrangements of the elements.
Hector also, and Achilles, and Agamemnon, and all the Greeks in general,
and the Barbarians with Helen and Paris, being of the same nature, you
will of course say are introduced merely for the sake of the
machinery <span id="fr_484"></span>[485](#fn_484.md) of the poem, not one
of these personages having really existed. But these things we have put
forth only for argument’s sake; for it is not allowable even to compare
our notion of God with those who are wallowing in matter and mud.
