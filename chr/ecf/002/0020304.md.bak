<span id="vi.iv.i.xi"></span>

##### <span id="vi.iv.i.xi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XI.—What is the Philosophy Which the Apostle Bids Us Shun?

<span id="vi.iv.i.xi-p1"></span>This, then, “the wisdom of the world is
foolishness with God,” and of those who are “the wise the Lord knoweth
their thoughts that they are vain.” <span
id="fr_1914"></span>[1915](#fn_1914.md) Let no man therefore glory on
account of pre-eminence in human thought. For it is written well in
Jeremiah, “Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, and let not the
mighty man glory in his might, and let not the rich man glory in his
riches: but let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth
and knoweth that I am the <span class="sc"><span
id="vi.iv.i.xi-p2.2"></span>Lord</span>, that executeth mercy and
judgment and righteousness upon the earth: for in these things is my
delight, saith the <span class="sc"><span
id="vi.iv.i.xi-p2.3"></span>Lord</span>.” <span
id="fr_1915"></span>[1916](#fn_1915.md) “That we should trust not in
ourselves, but in God who raiseth the dead,” says the apostle, “who
delivered us from so great a death, that our faith should not stand in
the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.” “For the spiritual man
judgeth all things, but he himself is judged of no man.” <span
id="fr_1916"></span>[1917](#fn_1916.md) I hear also those words of his,
“And these things I say, lest any man should beguile you with enticing
words, or one should enter in to spoil you.” <span
id="fr_1917"></span>[1918](#fn_1917.md) And again, “Beware lest any man
spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of
men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ;” <span
id="fr_1918"></span>[1919](#fn_1918.md) branding not all philosophy, but
the Epicurean, which Paul mentions in the Acts of the Apostles, <span
id="fr_1919"></span>[1920](#fn_1919.md) which abolishes providence and
deifies pleasure, and whatever other philosophy honours the elements,
but places not over them the efficient cause, nor apprehends the
Creator. <span id="fr_1920"></span>[1921](#fn_1920.md)

<span id="vi.iv.i.xi-p9"></span>The Stoics also, whom he mentions too,
say not well that the Deity, being a body, pervades the vilest matter.
He calls the jugglery of logic “the tradition of men.” Wherefore also he
adds, “Avoid juvenile <span id="fr_1921"></span>[1922](#fn_1921.md)
questions. For such contentions are puerile.” “But virtue is no lover of
boys,” says the philosopher Plato. And our struggle, according to
Gorgias Leontinus, requires two virtues—boldness and wisdom,—boldness to
undergo danger, and wisdom to understand the enigma. For the Word, like
the Olympian <span id="page_312">p. 312</span> <span
id="vi.iv.i.xi-Page_312"></span>proclamation, calls him who is willing,
and crowns him who is able to continue unmoved as far as the truth is
concerned. And, in truth, the Word does not wish him who has believed to
be idle. For He says, “Seek, and ye shall find.” <span
id="fr_1922"></span>[1923](#fn_1922.md) But seeking ends in finding,
driving out the empty trifling, and approving of the contemplation which
confirms our faith. “And this I say, lest any man beguile you with
enticing words,” <span id="fr_1923"></span>[1924](#fn_1923.md) says the
apostle, evidently as having learned to distinguish what was said by
him, and as being taught to meet objections. “As ye have therefore
received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in Him, rooted and built up in
Him, and stablished in the faith.” <span
id="fr_1924"></span>[1925](#fn_1924.md) Now persuasion is \[the means of\]
being established in the faith. “Beware lest any man spoil you of faith
in Christ by philosophy and vain deceit,” which does away with
providence, “after the tradition of men;” for the philosophy which is in
accordance with divine tradition establishes and confirms providence,
which, being done away with, the economy of the Saviour appears a myth,
while we are influenced “after the elements of the world, and not after
Christ.” <span id="fr_1925"></span>[1926](#fn_1925.md) For the teaching
which is agreeable to Christ deifies the Creator, and traces providence
in particular events, <span id="fr_1926"></span>[1927](#fn_1926.md) and
knows the nature of the elements to be capable of change and production,
and teaches that we ought to aim at rising up to the power which
assimilates to God, and to prefer the dispensation <span
id="fr_1927"></span>[1928](#fn_1927.md) as holding the first rank and
superior to all training.

<span id="vi.iv.i.xi-p17"></span>The elements are worshipped,—the air by
Diogenes, the water by Thales, the fire by Hippasus; and by those who
suppose atoms to be the first principles of things, arrogating the name
of philosophers, being wretched creatures devoted to pleasure. <span
id="fr_1928"></span>[1929](#fn_1928.md) “Wherefore I pray,” says the
apostle, “that your love may abound yet more and more, in knowledge and
in all judgment, that ye may approve things that are excellent.” <span
id="fr_1929"></span>[1930](#fn_1929.md) “Since, when we were children,”
says the same apostle, “we were kept in bondage under the rudiments of
the world. And the child, though heir, differeth nothing from a servant,
till the time appointed of the father.” <span
id="fr_1930"></span>[1931](#fn_1930.md) Philosophers, then, are children,
unless they have been made men by Christ. “For if the son of the bond
woman shall not be heir with the son of the free,” <span
id="fr_1931"></span>[1932](#fn_1931.md) at least he is the seed of Abraham,
though not of promise, receiving what belongs to him by free gift. “But
strong meat belongeth to those that are of full age, even those who by
reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and
evil.” <span id="fr_1932"></span>[1933](#fn_1932.md) “For every one that
useth milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness; for he is a
babe,” <span id="fr_1933"></span>[1934](#fn_1933.md) and not yet acquainted
with the word, according to which he has believed and works, and not
able to give a reason in himself. “Prove all things,” the apostle says,
“and hold fast that which is good,” <span
id="fr_1934"></span>[1935](#fn_1934.md) speaking to spiritual men, who
judge what is said according to truth, whether it seems or truly holds
by the truth. “He who is not corrected by discipline errs, and stripes
and reproofs give the discipline of wisdom,” the reproofs manifestly
that are with love. “For the right heart seeketh knowledge.” <span
id="fr_1935"></span>[1936](#fn_1935.md) “For he that seeketh the Lord shall
find knowledge with righteousness; and they who have sought it rightly
have found peace.” <span id="fr_1936"></span>[1937](#fn_1936.md) “And I
will know,” it is said, “not the speech of those which are puffed up,
but the power.” In rebuke of those who are wise in appearance, and think
themselves wise, but are not in reality wise, he writes: “For the
kingdom of God is not in word.” <span
id="fr_1937"></span>[1938](#fn_1937.md) It is not in that which is not
true, but which is only probable according to opinion; but he said “in
power,” for the truth alone is powerful. And again: “If any man thinketh
that he knoweth anything, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know.”
For truth is never mere opinion. But the “supposition of knowledge
inflates,” and fills with pride; “but charity edifieth,” which deals not
in supposition, but in truth. Whence it is said, “If any man loves, he
is known.” <span id="fr_1938"></span>[1939](#fn_1938.md)
