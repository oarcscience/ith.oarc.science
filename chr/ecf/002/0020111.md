##### <span id="iv.ii.ii.xiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIII.—Remarks on the Creation of the World.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xiii-p1"></span>Moreover, his \[Hesiod’s\] human, and
mean, and very weak conception, so far as regards God, is discovered in
his beginning to relate the creation of all things from the earthly
things here below. For man, being below, begins to build from the earth,
and cannot in order make the roof, unless he has first laid the
foundation. But the power of God is shown in this, that, first of all,
He creates out of nothing, according to His will, the things that are
made. “For the things which are impossible with men are possible with
God.” <span id="fr_572"></span>[573](#fn_572) Wherefore, also, the
prophet mentioned that the creation of the heavens first of all took
place, as a kind of roof, saying: “At the first God created the
heavens”—that is, that by means of the “first” principle the heavens
were made, as we have already shown. And by “earth” he means the ground
and foundation, as by “the deep” he means the multitude of waters; and
“darkness” he speaks of, on account of the heaven which God made
covering the waters and the earth like a lid. And by the Spirit which is
borne above the waters, <span id="page_100">p. 100</span> <span
id="iv.ii.ii.xiii-Page_100"></span>he means that which God gave for
animating the creation, as he gave life to man, <span
id="fr_573"></span>[574](#fn_573) mixing what is fine with what is fine.
For the Spirit is fine, and the water is fine, that the Spirit may
nourish the water, and the water penetrating everywhere along with the
Spirit, may nourish creation. For the Spirit being one, and holding the
place of light, <span id="fr_574"></span>[575](#fn_574) was between the
water and the heaven, in order that the darkness might not in any way
communicate with the heaven, which was nearer God, before God said, “Let
there be light.” The heaven, therefore, being like a dome-shaped
covering, comprehended matter which was like a clod. And so another
prophet, Isaiah by name, spoke in these words: “It is God who made the
heavens as a vault, and stretched them as a tent to dwell in.” <span
id="fr_575"></span>[576](#fn_575) The command, then, of God, that is,
His Word, shining as a lamp in an enclosed chamber, lit up all that was
under heaven, when He had made light apart from the world. <span
id="fr_576"></span>[577](#fn_576) And the light God called Day, and the
darkness Night. Since man would not have been able to call the light
Day, or the darkness Night, nor, indeed, to have given names to the
other things, had not he received the nomenclature from God, who made
the things themselves. In the very beginning, therefore, of the history
and genesis of the world, the holy Scripture spoke not concerning this
firmament \[which we see\], but concerning another heaven, which is to
us invisible, after which this heaven which we see has been called
“firmament,” and to which half the water was taken up that it might
serve for rains, and showers, and dews to mankind. And half the water
was left on earth for rivers, and fountains, and seas. The water, then,
covering all the earth, and specially its hollow places, God, through
His Word, next caused the waters to be collected into one collection,
and the dry land to become visible, which formerly had been invisible.
The earth thus becoming visible, was yet without form. God therefore
formed and adorned it <span id="fr_577"></span>[578](#fn_577) with all
kinds of herbs, and seeds and plants.
