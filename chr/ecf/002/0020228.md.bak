##### <span id="v.iii.xx-p0.1"></span>Chapter XX.—Man Must Be Possessed Both of a Body and Soul Hereafter, that the Judgment Passed Upon Him May Be Just.

<span id="v.iii.xx-p1"></span>For either death is the entire extinction
of life, the soul being dissolved and corrupted along with the body, or
the soul remains by itself, incapable of dissolution, of dispersion, of
corruption, whilst the body is corrupted and dissolved, retaining no
longer any remembrance of past actions, nor sense of what it experienced
in connection with the soul. If the life of men is to be utterly
extinguished, it is manifest there will be no care for men who are not
living, no judgment respecting those who have lived in virtue or in
vice; but there will rush in again upon us whatever belongs to a lawless
life, and the swarm of absurdities which follow from it, and that which
is the summit of this lawlessness—atheism. But if the body were to be
corrupted, and each of the dissolved particles to pass to its kindred
element, yet the soul to remain by itself as immortal, neither on this
supposition would any judgment on the soul take place, since there would
be an absence of equity: for it is unlawful to suspect that any judgment
can proceed out of God and from God which is wanting in equity. Yet
equity *is* wanting to the judgment, if the being is not preserved in
existence who practiced righteousness or lawlessness: for that which
practiced each of the things in life on which the judgment is passed was
man, not soul by itself. To sum up all in a word, this view will in no
case consist with equity.
