##### <span id="vi.iv.vi.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.—The Gospel Was Preached to Jews and Gentiles in Hades. <span id="fr_3260"></span>[3261](#fn_3260.md)

<span id="vi.iv.vi.vi-p2"></span>But as the proclamation \[of the
Gospel\] has come now at the fit time, so also at the fit time were the
Law and the Prophets given to the Barbarians, and Philosophy to the
Greeks, to fit their ears for the Gospel. “Therefore,” says the Lord who
delivered Israel, “in an acceptable time have I heard thee, and in a day
of salvation have I helped thee. And I have given thee for a Covenant to
the nations; that thou mightest inhabit the earth, and receive the
inheritance of the wilderness; saying to those that are in bonds, Come
forth; and to those that are in darkness, Show yourselves.” For if the
“prisoners” are the Jews, of whom the Lord said, “Come forth, ye that
will, from your bonds,”—meaning the voluntary bound, and who have taken
on them “*the burdens grievous to be borne*” <span
id="fr_3261"></span>[3262](#fn_3261.md) by human injunction—it is plain
that “those in darkness” are they who have the ruling faculty of the
soul buried in idolatry.

<span id="vi.iv.vi.vi-p4"></span>For to those who were righteous
according to the law, faith was wanting. Wherefore also the Lord, in
healing them, said, “Thy faith hath saved thee.” <span
id="fr_3262"></span>[3263](#fn_3262.md) But to those that were righteous
according to philosophy, not only faith in the Lord, but also the
abandonment of idolatry, were necessary. Straightway, on the revelation
of the truth, they also repented of their previous conduct.

<span id="vi.iv.vi.vi-p6"></span>Wherefore the Lord preached the Gospel
to those in Hades. Accordingly the Scripture says, “Hades says to
Destruction, We have not seen His form, but we have heard His
voice.” <span id="fr_3263"></span>[3264](#fn_3263.md) It is not plainly the
place, which, the words above say, heard the voice, but those who have
been put in Hades, and have abandoned themselves to destruction, as
persons who have thrown themselves voluntarily from a ship into the sea.
They, then, are those that hear the divine power and voice. For who in
his senses can suppose the souls of the righteous and those of sinners
in the same condemnation, charging Providence with injustice?

<span id="vi.iv.vi.vi-p8"></span>But how? Do not \[the Scriptures\] show
that the Lord preached <span id="fr_3264"></span>[3265](#fn_3264.md) the
Gospel to those that perished in the flood, or rather had been chained,
and to those kept “in ward and guard”? <span
id="fr_3265"></span>[3266](#fn_3265.md) And it has been shown also, <span
id="fr_3266"></span>[3267](#fn_3266.md) in the second book of the
*Stromata*, that the apostles, following the Lord, preached the Gospel
to those in Hades. For it was requisite, in my opinion, that as here, so
also there, the best of the disciples should be imitators of the Master;
so that He should bring to repentance those belonging to the Hebrews,
and they the Gentiles; that is, those who had lived in righteousness
according to the Law and Philosophy, who had ended life not perfectly,
but sinfully. For it was suitable to the divine administration, that
those possessed of greater worth in righteousness, and whose life had
been pre-eminent, on repenting of their transgressions, though found in
another place, yet being confessedly of the number of the people of God
Almighty, should be saved, each one according to his individual
knowledge.

<span id="vi.iv.vi.vi-p12"></span>And, as I think, the Saviour also
exerts His might because it is His work to save; which accordingly He
also did by drawing to salvation those who became willing, by the
preaching \[of the Gospel\], to believe on Him, wherever they were. If,
then, the Lord descended to Hades for no other end but to preach the
Gospel, as He did descend; it was either to preach the Gospel to all or
to the Hebrews only. If, accordingly, to all, then all who believe shall
be saved, although they may be of the Gentiles, on making their
profession there; since God’s punishments <span id="page_491">p.
491</span> <span id="vi.iv.vi.vi-Page_491"></span>are saving and
disciplinary, leading to conversion, and choosing rather the repentance
them the death of a sinner; <span id="fr_3267"></span>[3268](#fn_3267.md)
and especially since souls, although darkened by passions, when released
from their bodies, are able to perceive more clearly, because of their
being no longer obstructed by the paltry flesh.

<span id="vi.iv.vi.vi-p14"></span>If, then, He preached only to the
Jews, who wanted the knowledge and faith of the Saviour, it is plain
that, since God is no respecter of persons, the apostles also, as here,
so there preached the Gospel to those of the heathen who were ready for
conversion. And it is well said by the Shepherd, “They went down with
them therefore into the water, and again ascended. But these descended
alive, and again ascended alive. But those who had fallen asleep,
descended dead, but ascended alive.” <span
id="fr_3268"></span>[3269](#fn_3268.md) Further the Gospel <span
id="fr_3269"></span>[3270](#fn_3269.md) says, “that many bodies of those
that slept arose,”—plainly as having been translated to a better
state. <span id="fr_3270"></span>[3271](#fn_3270.md) There took place,
then, a universal movement and translation through the economy of the
Saviour. <span id="fr_3271"></span>[3272](#fn_3271.md)

<span id="vi.iv.vi.vi-p19"></span>One righteous man, then, differs not,
as righteous, from another righteous man, whether he be of the Law or a
Greek. For God is not only Lord of the Jews, but of all men, and more
nearly the Father of those who know Him. For if to live well and
according to the law is to live, also to live rationally according to
the law is to live; and those who lived rightly before the Law were
classed under faith, <span id="fr_3272"></span>[3273](#fn_3272.md) and
judged to be righteous,—it is evident that those, too, who were outside
of the Law, having lived rightly, in consequence of the peculiar nature
of the voice, <span id="fr_3273"></span>[3274](#fn_3273.md) though they are
in Hades and in ward, <span id="fr_3274"></span>[3275](#fn_3274.md) on
hearing the voice of the Lord, whether that of His own person or that
acting through His apostles, with all speed turned and believed. For we
remember that the Lord is “the power of God,” <span
id="fr_3275"></span>[3276](#fn_3275.md) and power can never be weak.

<span id="vi.iv.vi.vi-p24"></span>So I think it is demonstrated that the
God being good, and the Lord powerful, they save with a righteousness
and equality which extend to all that turn to Him, whether here or
elsewhere. For it is not here alone that the active power of God is
beforehand, but it is everywhere and is always at work. Accordingly, in
the *Preaching of Peter*, the Lord says to the disciples after the
resurrection, “I have chosen you twelve disciples, judging you worthy of
me,” whom the Lord wished to be apostles, having judged them faithful,
sending them into the world to the men on the earth, that they may know
that there is one God, showing clearly what would take place by the
faith of Christ; that they who heard and believed should be saved; and
that those who believed not, after having heard, should bear witness,
not having the excuse to allege, We have not heard.

<span id="vi.iv.vi.vi-p25"></span>What then? Did not the same
dispensation obtain in Hades, so that even there, all the souls, on
hearing the proclamation, might either exhibit repentance, or confess
that their punishment was just, because they believed not? And it were
the exercise of no ordinary arbitrariness, for those who had departed
before the advent of the Lord (not having the Gospel preached to them,
and having afforded no ground from themselves, in consequence of
believing or not) to obtain either salvation or punishment. For it is
not right that these should be condemned without trial, and that those
alone who lived after the advent should have the advantage of the divine
righteousness. But to all rational souls it was said from above,
“Whatever one of you has done in ignorance, without clearly knowing God,
if, on becoming conscious, he repent, all his sins will be forgiven
him.” <span id="fr_3276"></span>[3277](#fn_3276.md) “For, behold,” it is
said, “I have set before your face death and life, that ye may choose
life.” <span id="fr_3277"></span>[3278](#fn_3277.md) God says that He set,
not that He made both, in order to the comparison of choice. And in
another Scripture He says, “If ye hear Me, and be willing, ye shall eat
the good of the land. But if ye hear Me not, and are not willing, the
sword shall devour you: for the mouth of the <span class="sc"><span
id="vi.iv.vi.vi-p27.2"></span>Lord</span> hath spoken these
things.” <span id="fr_3278"></span>[3279](#fn_3278.md)

<span id="vi.iv.vi.vi-p29"></span>Again, David expressly (or rather the
Lord in the person of the saint, and the same from the foundation of the
world is each one who at different periods is saved, and shall be saved
by faith) says, “My heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced, and my flesh
shall still rest in hope. For Thou shalt not leave my soul in hell, nor
wilt Thou give Thine holy one to see corruption. Thou hast made known to
me the paths of life, Thou wilt make me full of joy in Thy
presence.” <span id="fr_3279"></span>[3280](#fn_3279.md) As, then, the
people was precious to the Lord, so also is the entire holy people; he
also who is converted from the Gentiles, who was prophesied under the
name of proselyte, along with the Jew. For rightly the Scripture says,
that “the ox and the bear shall come together.” <span
id="fr_3280"></span>[3281](#fn_3280.md) For the Jew is designated by the
ox, from the animal under the yoke being reckoned clean, according <span
id="page_492">p. 492</span> <span id="vi.iv.vi.vi-Page_492"></span>to
the law; for the ox both parts the hoof and chews the cud. And the
Gentile is designated by the bear, which is an unclean and wild beast.
And this animal brings forth a shapeless lump of flesh, which it shapes
into the likeness of a beast solely by its tongue. For he who is
convened from among the Gentiles is formed from a beastlike life to
gentleness by the word; and, when once tamed, is made clean, just as the
ox. For example, the prophet says, “The sirens, and the daughters of the
sparrows, and all the beasts of the field, shall bless me.” <span
id="fr_3281"></span>[3282](#fn_3281.md) Of the number of unclean animals,
the wild beasts of the field are known to be, that is, of the world;
since those who are wild in respect of faith, and polluted in life, and
not purified by the righteousness which is according to the law, are
called wild beasts. But changed from wild beasts by the faith of the
Lord, they become men of God, advancing from the wish to change to the
fact. For some the Lord exhorts, and to those who have already made the
attempt he stretches forth His hand, and draws them up. “For the Lord
dreads not the face of any one, nor will He regard greatness; for He
hath made small and great, and cares alike for all.” <span
id="fr_3282"></span>[3283](#fn_3282.md) And David says, “For the heathen
are fixed in the destruction they have caused; their foot is taken in
the snare which they hid.” <span id="fr_3283"></span>[3284](#fn_3283.md)
“But the <span class="sc"><span
id="vi.iv.vi.vi-p34.2"></span>Lord</span> was a refuge to the poor, a
help in season also in affliction.” <span
id="fr_3284"></span>[3285](#fn_3284.md) Those, then, that were in
affliction had the Gospel seasonably proclaimed. And therefore it said,
“Declare among the heathen his pursuits,” <span
id="fr_3285"></span>[3286](#fn_3285.md) that they may not be judged
unjustly.

<span id="vi.iv.vi.vi-p37"></span>If, then, He preached the Gospel to
those in the flesh that they might not be condemned unjustly, how is it
conceivable that He did not for the same cause preach the Gospel to
those who had departed this life before His advent? “For the righteous
<span class="sc"><span id="vi.iv.vi.vi-p37.1"></span>Lord</span> loveth
righteousness: His countenance beholdeth uprightness.” <span
id="fr_3286"></span>[3287](#fn_3286.md) “But he that loveth wickedness
hateth his own soul.” <span id="fr_3287"></span>[3288](#fn_3287.md)

<span id="vi.iv.vi.vi-p40"></span>If, then, in the deluge all sinful
flesh perished, punishment having been inflicted on them for correction,
we must first believe that the will of God, which is disciplinary and
beneficent, <span id="fr_3288"></span>[3289](#fn_3288.md) saves those who
turn to Him. Then, too, the more subtle substance, the soul, could never
receive any injury from the grosser element of water, its subtle and
simple nature rendering it impalpable, called as it is incorporeal. But
whatever is gross, made so in consequence of sin, this is cast away
along with the carnal spirit which lusts against the soul. <span
id="fr_3289"></span>[3290](#fn_3289.md)

<span id="vi.iv.vi.vi-p43"></span>Now also Valentinus, the Coryphæus of
those who herald community, in his book on *The Intercourse of Friends*,
writes in these words: “Many of the things that are written, though in
common books, are found written in the church of God. For those sayings
which proceed from the heart are vain. For the law written in the heart
is the People <span id="fr_3290"></span>[3291](#fn_3290.md) of the
Beloved—loved and loving Him.” For whether it be the Jewish writings or
those of the philosophers that he calls “the Common Books,” he makes the
truth common. And Isidore, <span id="fr_3291"></span>[3292](#fn_3291.md) at
once son and disciple to Basilides, in the first book of the
*Expositions of the Prophet Parchor*, writes also in these words: “The
Attics say that certain things were intimated to Socrates, in
consequence of a dæmon attending on him. And Aristotle says that all men
are provided with dæmons, that attend on them during the time they are
in the body,—having taken this piece of prophetic instruction and
transferred it to his own books, without acknowledging whence he had
abstracted this statement.” And again, in the second book of his work,
he thus writes: “And let no one think that what we say is peculiar to
the elect, was said before by any philosophers. For it is not a
discovery of theirs. For having appropriated it from our prophets, they
attributed it to him who is wise according to them.” Again, in the same:
“For to me it appears that those who profess to philosophize, do so that
they may learn what is the winged oak, <span
id="fr_3292"></span>[3293](#fn_3292.md) and the variegated robe on it, all
of which Pherecydes has employed as theological allegories, having taken
them from the prophecy of Cham.”
