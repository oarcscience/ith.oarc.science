#### <span id="ii.iii.x-p0.1"></span>Commandment Tenth.

##### <span id="ii.iii.x-p0.2"></span>Of Grief, and Not Grieving the Spirit of God Which is in Us.

##### <span id="ii.iii.x-p0.3"></span>Chap. I.

<span id="ii.iii.x-p1"></span>“Remove from you,” says he, “grief; for
she is the sister of doubt and anger.” “How, sir,” say I, “is she the
sister of these? for anger, doubt, and grief seem to be quite different
from each other.” “You are senseless, O man. Do you not perceive that
grief is more wicked than all the spirits, and most terrible to the
servants of God, and more than all other spirits destroys man and
crushes out the Holy Spirit, and yet, on the other hand, she saves him?”
“I am senseless, sir,” say I, “and do not understand these parables. For
how she can crush out, and on the other hand save, I do not perceive.”
“Listen,” says he. “Those who have never searched for the truth, nor
investigated the nature of the Divinity, but have simply believed, when
they devote themselves to and become mixed up with business, and wealth,
and heathen friendships, and many other actions of this world, <span
id="fr_209"></span>[210](#fn_209) do not perceive the parables of
Divinity; for their minds are darkened by these actions, and they are
corrupted and become dried up. Even as beautiful vines, when they are
neglected, are withered up by thorns and divers plants, so men who have
believed, and have afterwards fallen away into many of those actions
above mentioned, go astray in their minds, and lose all understanding in
regard to righteousness; for if they hear of righteousness, their minds
are occupied with their business, <span
id="fr_210"></span>[211](#fn_210) and they give no heed at all. Those,
on the other hand, who have the fear of God, and search after Godhead
and truth, and have their hearts turned to the Lord, quickly perceive
and understand what is said to them, because they have the fear of the
Lord in them. For where the Lord dwells, there is much understanding.
Cleave, then, to the Lord, and you will understand and perceive all
things.”

##### <span id="ii.iii.x-p3.2"></span>Chap. II.

<span id="ii.iii.x-p4"></span>“Hear, then,” says he, “foolish man, how
grief crushes out the Holy Spirit, and on the <span id="page_27">p.
27</span> <span id="ii.iii.x-Page_27"></span>other hand saves. When the
doubting man attempts any deed, and fails in it on account of his doubt,
this grief enters into the man, and grieves the Holy Spirit, and crushes
him out. Then, on the other hand, when anger attaches itself to a man in
regard to any matter, and he is embittered, then grief enters into the
heart of the man who was irritated, and he is grieved at the deed which
he did, and repents that he has wrought a wicked deed. This grief, then,
appears to be accompanied by salvation, because the man, after having
done a wicked deed, repented. <span id="fr_211"></span>[212](#fn_211)
Both actions grieve the Spirit: doubt, because it did not accomplish its
object; and anger grieves the Spirit, because it did what was wicked.
Both these are grievous to the Holy Spirit—doubt and anger. Wherefore
remove grief from you, and crush not the Holy Spirit which dwells in
you, lest he entreat God <span id="fr_212"></span>[213](#fn_212) against
you, and he withdraw from you. For the Spirit of God which has been
granted to us to dwell in this body does not endure grief nor
straitness. Wherefore put on cheerfulness, which always is agreeable and
acceptable to God, <span id="fr_213"></span>[214](#fn_213) and rejoice
in it. For every cheerful man does what is good, and minds what is good,
and despises grief; <span id="fr_214"></span>[215](#fn_214) but the
sorrowful man always acts wickedly. First, he acts wickedly because he
grieves the Holy Spirit, which was given to man a cheerful Spirit.
Secondly, Grieving the Holy Spirit, <span
id="fr_215"></span>[216](#fn_215) he works iniquity, neither entreating
the Lord nor confessing <span id="fr_216"></span>[217](#fn_216) to Him.
For the entreaty of the sorrowful man has no power to ascend to the
altar of God.” “Why,” say I, “does not the entreaty of the grieved man
ascend to the altar?” “Because,” says he, “grief sits in his heart.
Grief, then, mingled with his entreaty, does not permit the entreaty to
ascend pure to the altar of God. For as vinegar and wine, when mixed in
the same vessel, do not give the same pleasure \[as wine alone gives\],
so grief mixed with the Holy Spirit does not produce the same entreaty
\[as would be produced by the Holy Spirit alone\]. Cleanse yourself from
this wicked grief, and you will live to God; and all will live to God
who drive away grief from them, and put on all cheerfulness.” <span
id="fr_217"></span>[218](#fn_217)

<span id="ii.iii.x-p2"></span> The Vat. has here a considerable number
of sentences, found in the Greek, the Palatine, and the Æthiopic, in
Commandment Eleventh. In consequence of this transference, the Eleventh
Commandment in the Vatican differs considerably from the others in the
position of the sentences, but otherwise it is substantially the same.

<span id="ii.iii.x-p10"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p10.1"></span>ἐξομολογοὑμενος</span> one would expect here
to mean “giving thanks,” a meaning which it has in the New Testament:
but as <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p10.2"></span>ἐξομολογοῦμαι</span> means to “confess”
throughout the *Pastor of Hermas*, it is likely that it means
“confessing” here also.
