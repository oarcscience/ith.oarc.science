##### <span id="iv.ii.i.xiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIV.—Theophilus an Example of Conversion.

<span id="iv.ii.i.xiv-p1"></span>Therefore, do not be sceptical, but
believe; for I myself also used to disbelieve that this would take
place, but now, having taken these things into consideration, I believe.
At the same time, I met with the sacred Scriptures <span
id="fr_543"></span>[544](#fn_543.md) of the holy prophets, who also by the
Spirit of God foretold the things that have already happened, just as
they came to pass, and the things now occurring as they are now
happening, and things future in the order in which they shall be
accomplished. Admitting, therefore, the proof which events happening as
predicted afford, I do not disbelieve, but I believe, obedient to God,
whom, if you please, do you also submit to, believing Him, lest if now
you continue unbelieving, you be convinced hereafter, when you are
tormented with eternal punishments; which punishments, when they had
been foretold by the prophets, the later-born poets and philosophers
stole from the holy Scriptures, to make their doctrines worthy of
credit. Yet these also have spoken beforehand of the punishments that
are to light upon the profane and unbelieving, in order that none be
left without a witness, or be able to say, “We have not heard, neither
have we known.” But do you also, if you please, give reverential
attention to the prophetic Scriptures, <span
id="fr_544"></span>[545](#fn_544.md) and they will make your way plainer
for escaping the eternal punishments, and obtaining the eternal prizes
of God. For He who gave the mouth for speech, and formed the ear to
hear, and made the eye to see, will examine all things, and will judge
righteous judgment, rendering merited awards to each. To those who by
patient continuance in well-doing <span
id="fr_545"></span>[546](#fn_545.md) seek immortality, He will give life
everlasting, joy, peace, rest, and abundance of good things, which
neither hath eye seen, nor ear heard, nor hath it entered into the heart
of man to conceive. <span id="fr_546"></span>[547](#fn_546.md) But to the
unbelieving and despisers, who obey not the truth, but are obedient to
unrighteousness, when they shall have been filled with adulteries and
fornications, and filthiness, and covetousness, and unlawful idolatries,
there shall be anger and wrath, tribulation and anguish, <span
id="fr_547"></span>[548](#fn_547.md) and at the last everlasting fire shall
possess such men. Since you said, “Show me thy God,” this is my God, and
I counsel you to fear Him and to trust Him.

sacramental energy, referring to [John vi.

I cannot reconcile what Scripture says of itself with the modern
*refinements* as to the human and divine element, while fully admitting
that there are such elements, intermixed and interpenetrated mutually,
beyond all power of dissection by us. I prefer the childlike docility of
the Fathers.\]
