##### <span id="v.ii.xvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVII.—The Names of the Gods and Their Images are But of Recent Date.

<span id="v.ii.xvii-p1"></span>An apologist must adduce more precise
arguments than I have yet given, both concering the names of the gods,
to show that they are of recent origin, and concerning their images, to
show that they are, so to say, but of yesterday. You yourselves,
however, are thoroughly acquainted with these matters, since you are
versed in all departments of knowledge, and are beyond all other men
familiar with the ancients. I assert, then, that it was Orpheus, and
Homer, and Hesiod who <span id="fr_745"></span>[746](#fn_745.md) gave both
genealogies and names to those whom they call gods. Such, too, is the
testimony of Herodotus. <span id="fr_746"></span>[747](#fn_746.md) “My
opinion,” he says, “is that Hesiod and Homer preceded me by four hundred
years, and no more; and it was they who framed a theogony for the
Greeks, and gave the gods their names, and assigned them their several
honours and functions, and described their forms.” Representations of
the gods, again, were not in use at all, so long as statuary, and
painting, and sculpture were unknown; nor did they become common until
Saurias the Samian, and Crato the Sicyonian, and Cleanthes the
Corinthian, and the Corinthian damsel <span
id="fr_747"></span>[748](#fn_747.md) appeared, when drawing in outline was
invented by Saurias, who sketched a horse in the sun, and painting by
Crato, who painted in oil on a whitened tablet the outlines of a man and
woman; and the art of making figures in relief (<span
class="Greek"><span id="v.ii.xvii-p4.1"></span>κοροπλαθική</span>) was
invented by the damsel, <span id="fr_748"></span>[749](#fn_748.md) who,
being in love with a person, traced his shadow on a wall as he lay
asleep, and her father, being delighted with the exactness of the
resemblance (he was a potter), carved out the sketch and filled it up
with clay: this figure is still preserved at Corinth. After these,
Dædalus and Theodorus the Milesian further invented sculpture and
statuary. You perceive, then, that the time since representations of
form and the making of images began is so short, that we can name the
artist of each particular god. The image of Artemis at Ephesus, for
example, and that of Athenâ (or rather of Athelâ, for so is she named by
those who speak more in the style of the mysteries; for thus was the
ancient image made of the olive-tree called), and the sitting figure of
the same goddess, were made by Endœus, a pupil of Dædalus; the Pythian
god was the work of Theodorus and Telecles; and the Delian <span
id="page_137">p. 137</span> <span id="v.ii.xvii-Page_137"></span>god and
Artemis are due to the art of Tectæus and Angelio; Hera in Samos and in
Argos came from the hands of Smilis, and the other statues <span
id="fr_749"></span>[750](#fn_749.md) were by Phidias; Aphrodité the
courtezan in Cnidus is the production of Praxiteles; Asclepius in
Epidaurus is the work of Phidias. In a word, of not one of these statues
can it be said that it was not made by man. If, then, these are gods,
why did they not exist from the beginning? Why, in sooth, are they
younger than those who made them? Why, in sooth, in order to their
coming into existence, did they need the aid of men and art? They are
nothing but earth, and stones, and matter, and curious art. <span
