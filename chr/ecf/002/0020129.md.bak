##### <span id="iv.ii.ii.xxxi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXI.—The History After the Flood.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xxxi-p1"></span>After the flood was there again a
beginning of cities and kings, in the following manner:—The first city
was Babylon, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.
And their king was called Nebroth \[Nimrod\]. From these came Asshur,
from whom also the Assyrians receive their name. And Nimrod built the
cities Nineveh and Rehoboth, and Calah, and Resen, between Nineveh and
Calah; and Nineveh became a very great city. And another son of Shem,
the son of Noah, by name Mizraim, begat Ludim, and those called Anamim,
and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim, and Pathrusim, and Casluhim, out of whom
came Philistin. Of the three sons of Noah, however, and of their death
and genealogy, we have given a compendious register in the
above-mentioned book. But now we will mention the remaining facts both
concerning cities and kings, and the things that happened when there was
one speech and one language. Before the dividing of the languages these
fore-mentioned cities existed. But when men were about to be dispersed,
they took counsel of their own judgment, and not at the instigation of
God, to build a city, a tower whose top might reach into heaven, that
they might make a glorious name to themselves. Since, therefore, they
had dared, contrary to the will of God, to attempt a grand work, God
destroyed their city, and overthrew their tower. From that time He
confounded the languages of men, giving to each a different dialect. And
similarly did the Sibyl speak, when she declared that wrath would come
on the world. She says:—

> <span id="iv.ii.ii.xxxi-p1.1"></span> “When are fulfilled the threats
> of the great God,  
> With which He threatened men, when formerly  
> In the Assyrian land they built a tower,  
> And all were of one speech, and wished to rise  
> Even till they climbed unto the starry heaven,  
> Then the Immortal raised a mighty wind  
> And laid upon them strong necessity;  
> For when the wind threw down the mighty tower,  
> Then rose among mankind fierce strife and hate.  
> One speech was changed to many dialects,  
> And earth was filled with divers tribes and kings.”  

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xxxi-p2"></span>And so on. These things, then,
happened in the land of the Chaldæans. And in the land of Canaan there
was a city, by name Haran. And in these days, Pharaoh, who by the
Egyptians was also called Nechaoth, was first king of Egypt, and thus
the kings followed in succession. <span
id="fr_611"></span>[612](#fn_611.md) And in the land of Shinar, among those
called Chaldæans, <span id="page_107">p. 107</span> <span
id="iv.ii.ii.xxxi-Page_107"></span>the first king was Arioch, and next
after him Ellasar, and after him Chedorlaomer, king of Elam, and after
him Tidal, king of the nations called Assyrians. And there were five
other cities in the territory of Ham, the son of Noah; the first called
Sodom, then Gomorrah, Admah, Zeboiim, and Balah, which was also called
Zoar. And the names of their kings are these: Bera, king of Sodom;
Birsha, king of Gomorrah; Shinab, king of Admah; Shemeber, king of
Zeboiim; Bela, king of Zoar, which is also called Kephalac. <span
id="fr_612"></span>[613](#fn_612.md) These served Chedorlaomer, the king of
the Assyrians, for twelve years, and in the thirteenth year they
revolted from Chedorlaomer; and thus it came to pass at that time that
the four Assyrian kings waged war upon the five kings. This was the
first commencement of making war on the earth; and they destroyed the
giants Karnaim, and the strong nations that were with them in their
city, and the Horites of the mountains called Seir, as far as the plain
of Paran, which is by the wilderness. And at that time there was a
righteous king called Melchisedek, in the city of Salem, which now is
Jerusalem. This was the first priest of all priests <span
id="fr_613"></span>[614](#fn_613.md) of the Most High God; and from him the
above-named city Hierosolyma was called Jerusalem. <span
id="fr_614"></span>[615](#fn_614.md) And from his time priests were found
in all the earth. And after him reigned Abimelech in Gerar; and after
him another Abimelech. Then reigned Ephron, surnamed the Hittite. Such
are the names of the kings that were in former times. And the rest of
the kings of the Assyrians, during an interval of many years, have been
passed over in silence unrecorded, all writers narrating the events of
our recent days. There were these kings of Assyria: Tiglath-Pileser, and
after him Shalmaneser, then Sennacherib; and Adrammelech the Ethiopian,
who also reigned over Egypt, was his triarch;—though these things, in
comparison with our books, are quite recent.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xxxi-p3"></span> But the Benedictine editor
understands the words to mean, that the succeeding kings were in like
manner called Pharaoh.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xxxi-p4"></span> Theophilus spells some of the names
differently from what they are given in our text. For Tidal he has
Thargal; for Bera, Ballas; for Birsha, Barsas; for Shinab, Senaar; for
Shemeber, Hymoor. Kephalac is taken to be a corruption for Balak, which
in the previous sentence is inserted by many editors, though it is not
in the best <span class="sc"><span

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xxxi-p5"></span> \[St. Paul seems to teach us that
the whole story of Melchisedek is a “similitude,” and that the one Great
High Priest of our profession appeared to Abraham in that character, as
to Joshua in another, the “Captain of our salvation” ([Heb. vii.
1-3](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#001.md)<span
id="iv.ii.ii.xxxi-p5.1"></span>; [Josh. v.
13-15](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#013.md)<span
id="iv.ii.ii.xxxi-p5.2"></span>). We need a carefully digested work on
the apparitions of the Word before His incarnation, or the theophanies
of the *Old Testament*.\]

<span id="fn_614"></span>[107:615](0020129.htm#fr_614.md) <span
id="iv.ii.ii.xxxi-p5.3"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xxxi-p6"></span> \[Certainly a striking etymon,
“Salem of the priest.” But we can only accept it as a beautiful play
upon words.\]
