##### <span id="iii.ii.xxxvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXVI.—Testimony of the Chaldeans to the Antiquity of Moses.

<span id="iii.ii.xxxvi-p1"></span>But let Homer be not later than the
Trojan war; let it be granted that he was contemporary with it, or even
that he was in the army of Agamemnon, and, if any so please, that he
lived before the invention of letters. The Moses before mentioned will
be shown to have been many years older than the taking of Troy, and far
more ancient than the building of Troy, or than Tros and Dardanus. To
demonstrate this I will call in as witnesses the Chaldeans, the
Phœnicians and the Egyptians. And what more need I say? For it behoves
one who professes to persuade his hearers to make his narrative of
events very concise. Berosus, a Babylonian, a priest of their god Belus,
born in the time of Alexander, composed for Antiochus, the third after
him, the history of the Chaldeans in three books; and, narrating the
acts of the kings, he mentions one of them, Nabuchodonosor by name, who
made war against the Phœnicians and the Jews,—events which we know were
announced by our prophets, and which happened much later than the age of
Moses, seventy years before the Persian empire. But Berosus is a very
trustworthy man, and of this Juba is a witness, who, writing concerning
the Assyrians, says that he learned the history from Berosus: there are
two books of his concerning the Assyrians.
