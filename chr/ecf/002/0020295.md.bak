##### <span id="vi.iv.i.ii-p0.1"></span>Chapter II.—Objection to the Number of Extracts from Philosophical Writings in These Books Anticipated and Answered.

<span id="vi.iv.i.ii-p1"></span>In reference to these commentaries,
which contain as the exigencies of the case demand, the Hellenic
opinions, I say thus much to those who are fond of finding fault. First,
even if philosophy were useless, if the demonstration of its uselessness
does good, it is yet useful. Then those cannot condemn the Greeks, who
have only a mere hearsay knowledge of their opinions, and have not
entered into a minute investigation in each department, in order to
acquaintance with them. For the refutation, which is based on
experience, is entirely trustworthy. For the knowledge of what is
condemned is found the most complete demonstration. Many things, then,
though not contributing to the final result, equip the artist. And
otherwise erudition commends him, who sets forth the most essential
doctrines so as to produce persuasion in his hearers, engendering
admiration in those who are taught, and leads them to the truth. And
such persuasion is convincing, by which those that love learning admit
the truth; so that philosophy does not ruin life by being the originator
of false practices and base deeds, although some have calumniated it,
though it be the clear image of truth, a divine gift to the
Greeks; <span id="fr_1836"></span>[1837](#fn_1836.md) nor does it drag us
away from the faith, as if we were bewitched by some delusive art, but
rather, so to speak, by the use of an ampler circuit, obtains a common
exercise demonstrative of the faith. Further, the juxtaposition <span
id="page_304">p. 304</span> <span id="vi.iv.i.ii-Page_304"></span>of
doctrines, by comparison, saves the truth, from which follows knowledge.

<span id="vi.iv.i.ii-p3"></span>Philosophy came into existence, not on
its own account, but for the advantages reaped by us from knowledge, we
receiving a firm persuasion of true perception, through the knowledge of
things comprehended by the mind. For I do not mention that the
*Stromata*, forming a body of varied erudition, wish artfully to conceal
the seeds of knowledge. As, then, he who is fond of hunting captures the
game after seeking, tracking, scenting, hunting it down with dogs; so
truth, when sought and got with toil, appears a delicious <span
id="fr_1837"></span>[1838](#fn_1837.md) thing. Why, then, you will ask, did
you think it fit that such an arrangement should be adopted in your
memoranda? Because there is great danger in divulging the secret of the
true philosophy to those, whose delight it is unsparingly to speak
against everything, not justly; and who shout forth all kinds of names
and words indecorously, deceiving themselves and beguiling those who
adhere to them. “For the Hebrews seek signs,” as the apostle says, “and
the Greeks seek after wisdom.” <span
