##### <span id="iv.ii.ii.xxxvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXVI.—Prophecies of the Sibyl.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xxxvi-p1"></span>And the Sibyl, who was a prophetess
among the Greeks and the other nations, in the beginning of her
prophecy, reproaches the race of men, saying:—

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span> <span
id="iv.ii.ii.xxxvi-Page_109"></span>

> <span id="iv.ii.ii.xxxvi-p1.1"></span> “How are ye still so quickly
> lifted up,  
> And how so thoughtless of the end of life,  
> Ye mortal men of flesh, who are but nought?  
> Do ye not tremble, nor fear God most high?  
> Your Overseer, the Knower, Seer of all,  
> Who ever keeps those whom His hand first made,  
> Puts His sweet Spirit into all His works,  
> And gives Him for a guide to mortal men.  
> There is one only uncreated God,  
> Who reigns alone, all-powerful, very great,  
> From whom is nothing hid. He sees all things,  
> Himself unseen by any mortal eye.  
> Can mortal man see the immortal God,  
> Or fleshly eyes, which shun the noontide beams,  
> Look upon Him, who dwells beyond the heavens?  
> Worship Him then, the self-existent God,  
> The unbegotten Ruler of the world,  
> Who only was from everlasting time,  
> And shall to everlasting still abide.  
> Of evil counsels ye shall reap the fruit,  
> Because ye have not honoured the true God,  
> Nor offered to Him sacred hecatombs.  
> To those who dwell in Hades ye make gifts,  
> And unto demons offer sacrifice.  
> In madness and in pride ye have your walk;  
> And leaving the right way, ye wander wide,  
> And lose yourselves in pitfalls and in thorns.  
> Why do ye wander thus, O foolish men?  
> Cease your vain wanderings in the black, dark night;  
> Why follow darkness and perpetual gloom  
> When, see, there shines for you the blessed light?  
> Lo, He is clear—in Him there is no spot.  
> Turn, then, from darkness, and behold the day;  
> Be wise, and treasure wisdom in your breasts.  
> There is one God who sends the winds and rains,  
> The earthquakes, and the lightnings, and the plagues,  
> The famines, and the snow-storms, and the ice,  
> And all the woes that visit our sad race.  
> Nor these alone, but all things else He gives,  
> Ruling omnipotent in heaven and earth,  
> And self-existent from eternity.”  

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xxxvi-p2"></span>And regarding those \[gods\] that
are said to have been born, she said:—

> <span id="iv.ii.ii.xxxvi-p2.1"></span> “If all things that are born
> must also die,  
> “God cannot be produced by mortal man.  
> But there is only One, the All-Supreme,  
> Who made the heavens, with all their starry host,  
> The sun and moon; likewise the fruitful earth,  
> With all the waves of ocean, and the hills,  
> The fountains, and the ever flowing streams;  
> He also made the countless multitude  
> Of ocean creatures, and He keeps alive  
> All creeping things, both of the earth and sea;  
> And all the tuneful choir of birds He made,  
> Which cleave the air with wings, and with shrill pipe  
> Trill forth at morn their tender, clear-voiced song.  
> Within the deep glades of the hills He placed  
> A savage race of beasts; and unto men  
> He made all cattle subject, making man  
> The God-formed image, ruler over all,  
> And putting in subjection to his sway  
> Things many and incomprehensible.  
> For who of mortals can know all these things?  
> He only knows who made them at the first,  
> He the Creator, incorruptible,  
> Who dwells in upper air eternally;  
> Who proffers to the good most rich rewards,  
> And against evil and unrighteous men  
> Rouses revenge, and wrath, and bloody wars,  
> And pestilence, and many a tearful grief.  
> O man exalted vainly—say why thus  
> Hast thou so utterly destroyed thyself?  
> Have ye no shame worshipping beasts for gods?  
> And to believe the gods should steal your beasts,  
> Or that they need your vessels—is it not  
> Frenzy’s most profitless and foolish thought?  
> Instead of dwelling in the golden heavens,  
> Ye see your gods become the prey of worms,  
> And hosts of creatures noisome and unclean.  
> O fools! ye worship serpents, dogs, and cats,  
> Birds, and the creeping things of earth and sea,  
> Images made with hands, statues of stone,  
> And heaps of rubbish by the wayside placed.  
> All these, and many more vain things, ye serve,  
> Worshipping things disgraceful even to name:  
> These are the gods who lead vain men astray,  
> From whose mouth streams of deadly poison flow.  
> But unto Him in whom alone is life,  
> Life, and undying, everlasting light;  
> Who pours into man’s cup of life a joy  
> Sweeter than sweetest honey to his taste,—  
> Unto Him bow the head, to Him alone,  
> And walk in ways of everlasting peace.  
> Forsaking Him, ye all have turned aside,  
> And, in your raving folly, drained the cup  
> Of justice quite unmixed, pure, mastering, strong;  
> And ye will not again be sober men,  
> Ye will not come unto a sober mind,  
> And know your God and King, who looks on all:  
> Therefore, upon you burning fire shall come,  
> And ever ye shall daily burn in flames,  
> Ashamed for ever of your useless gods.  
> But those who worship the eternal God,  
> They shall inherit everlasting life,  
> Inhabiting the blooming realms of bliss,  
> And feasting on sweet food from starry heaven.”  

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xxxvi-p3"></span>That these things are true, and
useful, and just, and profitable to all men, is obvious. Even the poets
have spoken of the punishments of the wicked.
