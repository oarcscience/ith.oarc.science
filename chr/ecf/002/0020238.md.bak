##### <span id="vi.ii.ii-p0.1"></span>Chapter II.—The Absurdity and Impiety of the Heathen Mysteries and Fables About the Birth and Death of Their Gods.

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p1"></span>Explore not then too curiously the shrines
of impiety, or the mouths of caverns full of monstrosity, or the
Thesprotian caldron, or the Cirrhæan tripod, or the Dodonian copper. The
Gerandryon, <span id="fr_876"></span>[877](#fn_876.md) once regarded sacred
in the midst of desert sands, and the oracle there gone to decay with
the oak itself, consigned to the region of antiquated fables. The
fountain of Castalia is silent, and the other fountain of Colophon; and,
in like manner, all the rest of the springs of divination are dead, and
stripped of their vainglory, although at a late date, are shown with
their fabulous legends to have run dry. Recount to us also the
useless <span id="fr_877"></span>[878](#fn_877.md) oracles of that other
kind of divination, or rather madness, the Clarian, the Pythian, the
Didymæan, that of Amphiaraus, of Apollo, of Amphilochus; and if you
will, couple <span id="fr_878"></span>[879](#fn_878.md) <span
id="page_175">p. 175</span> <span id="vi.ii.ii-Page_175"></span>with
them the expounders of prodigies, the augurs, and the interpreters of
dreams. And bring and place beside the Pythian those that divine by
flour, and those that divine by barley, and the ventriloquists still
held in honour by many. Let the secret shrines of the Egyptians and the
necromancies of the Etruscans be consigned to darkness. Insane devices
truly are they all of unbelieving men. Goats, too, have been
confederates in this art of soothsaying, trained to divination; and
crows taught by men to give oracular responses to men.

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p5"></span>And what if I go over the mysteries? I
will not divulge them in mockery, as they say Alcibiades did, but I will
expose right well by the word of truth the sorcery hidden in them; and
those so-called gods of yours, whose are the mystic rites, I shall
display, as it were, on the stage of life, to the spectators of truth.
The bacchanals hold their orgies in honour of the frenzied Dionysus,
celebrating their sacred frenzy by the eating of raw flesh, and go
through the distribution of the parts of butchered victims, crowned with
snakes, shrieking out the name of that Eva by whom error came into the
world. The symbol of the Bacchic orgies is a consecrated serpent.
Moreover, according to the strict interpretation of the Hebrew term, the
name Hevia, aspirated, signifies a female serpent.

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p6"></span>Demeter and Proserpine have become the
heroines of a mystic drama; and their wanderings, and seizure, and
grief, Eleusis celebrates by torchlight processions. I think that the
derivation of orgies and mysteries ought to be traced, the former to the
wrath (<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.ii.ii-p6.1"></span>ὀργή</span>)
of Demeter against Zeus, the latter to the nefarious wickedness (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.ii.ii-p6.2"></span>μύσος</span>) relating to
Dionysus; but if from Myus of Attica, who Pollodorus says was killed in
hunting—no matter, I don’t grudge your mysteries the glory of funeral
honours. You may understand mysteria in another way, as mytheria
(hunting fables), the letters of the two words being interchanged; for
certainly fables of this sort hunt after the most barbarous of the
Thracians, the most senseless of the Phrygians, and the superstitious
among the Greeks.

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p7"></span>Perish, then, the man who was the author
of this imposture among men, be he Dardanus, who taught the mysteries of
the mother of the gods, or Eetion, who instituted the orgies and
mysteries of the Samothracians, or that Phrygian Midas who, having
learned the cunning imposture from Odrysus, communicated it to his
subjects. For I will never be persuaded by that Cyprian Islander
Cinyras, who dared to bring forth from night to the light of day the
lewd orgies of Aphrodité in his eagerness to deify a strumpet of his own
country. Others say that Melampus the son of Amythaon imported the
festivals of Ceres from Egypt into Greece, celebrating her grief in
song.

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p8"></span>These I would instance as the prime
authors of evil, the parents of impious fables and of deadly
superstition, who sowed in human life that seed of evil and ruin—the
mysteries.

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p9"></span>And now, for it is time, I will prove
their orgies to be full of imposture and quackery. And if you have been
initiated, you will laugh all the more at these fables of yours which
have been held in honour. I publish without reserve what has been
involved in secrecy, not ashamed to tell what you are not ashamed to
worship.

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p10"></span>There is then the foam-born and
Cyprus-born, the darling of Cinyras,—I mean Aphrodité, lover of the
virilia, because sprung from them, even from those of Uranus, that were
cut off,—those lustful members, that, after being cut off, offered
violence to the waves. Of members so lewd a worthy fruit—Aphrodité—is
born. In the rites which celebrate this enjoyment of the sea, as a
symbol of her birth a lump of salt and the phallus are handed to those
who are initiated into the art of uncleanness. And those initiated bring
a piece of money to her, as a courtesan’s paramours do to her.

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p11"></span>Then there are the mysteries of Demeter,
and Zeus’s wanton embraces of his mother, and the wrath of Demeter; I
know not what for the future I shall call her, mother or wife, on which
account it is that she is called Brimo, as is said; also the entreaties
of Zeus, and the drink of gall, the plucking out of the hearts of
sacrifices, and deeds that we dare not name. Such rites the Phrygians
perform in honour of Attis and Cybele and the Corybantes. And the story
goes, that Zeus, having torn away the orchites of a ram, brought them
out and cast them at the breasts of Demeter, paying thus a fraudulent
penalty for his violent embrace, pretending to have cut out his own. The
symbols of initiation into these rites, when set before you in a vacant
hour, I know will excite your laughter, although on account of the
exposure by no means inclined to laugh. “I have eaten out of the drum, I
have drunk out of the cymbal, I have carried the Cernos, <span
id="fr_879"></span>[880](#fn_879.md) I have slipped into the bedroom.” Are
not these tokens a disgrace? Are not the mysteries absurdity?

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p13"></span>What if I add the rest? Demeter becomes a
mother, Core <span id="fr_880"></span>[881](#fn_880.md) is reared up to
womanhood. And, in course of time, he who begot her,—this same Zeus has
intercourse with his own daughter Pherephatta,—after Ceres, the
mother,—forgetting his former abominable wickedness. Zeus is both the
father and the seducer of Core, <span id="page_176">p. 176</span> <span
id="vi.ii.ii-Page_176"></span>and shamefully courts her in the shape of
a dragon; his identity, however, was discovered. The token of the
Sabazian mysteries to the initiated is “the deity gliding over the
breast,”—the deity being this serpent crawling over the breasts of the
initiated. Proof surely this of the unbridled lust of Zeus. Pherephatta
has a child, though, to be sure, in the form of a bull, as an idolatrous
poet says,—

> <span id="vi.ii.ii-p14.1"></span> “The bull  
> The dragon’s father, and the father of the bull the dragon,  
> On a hill the herdsman’s hidden ox-goad,”—  

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p15"></span>alluding, as I believe, under the name of
the herdsman’s ox-goad, to the reed wielded by bacchanals. Do you wish
me to go into the story of Persephatta’s gathering of flowers, her
basket, and her seizure by Pluto (Aidoneus), and the rent in the earth,
and the swine of Eubouleus that were swallowed up with the two
goddesses; for which reason, in the Thesmophoria, speaking the Megaric
tongue, they thrust out swine? This mythological story the women
celebrate variously in different cities in the festivals called
Thesmophoria and Scirophoria; dramatizing in many forms the rape of
Pherephatta or Persephatta (Proserpine).

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p16"></span>The mysteries of Dionysus are wholly
inhuman; for while still a child, and the Curetes danced around \[his
cradle\] clashing their weapons, and the Titans having come upon them by
stealth, and having beguiled him with childish toys, these very Titans
tore him limb from limb when but a child, as the bard of this mystery,
the Thracian Orpheus, says:—

> <span id="vi.ii.ii-p16.1"></span> “Cone, and spinning-top, and
> limb-moving rattles,  
> And fair golden apples from the clear-toned Hesperides.”  

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p17"></span>And the useless symbols of this mystic
rite it will not be useless to exhibit for condemnation. These are dice,
ball, hoop, apples, top, <span id="fr_881"></span>[882](#fn_881.md)
looking-glass, tuft of wool.

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p19"></span>Athené (Minerva), to resume our account,
having abstracted the heart of Dionysus, was called Pallas, from the
vibrating of the heart; and the Titans who had torn him limb from limb,
setting a caldron on a tripod, and throwing into it the members of
Dionysus, first boiled them down, and then fixing them on spits, “held
them over the fire.” But Zeus having appeared, since he was a god,
having speedily perceived the savour of the pieces of flesh that were
being cooked,—that savour which your gods agree to have assigned to them
as their perquisite,—assails the Titans with his thunderbolt, and
consigns the members of Dionysus to his son Apollo to be interred. And
he—for he did not disobey Zeus—bore the dismembered corpse to Parnassus,
and there deposited it.

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p20"></span>If you wish to inspect the orgies of the
Corybantes, then know that, having killed their third brother, they
covered the head of the dead body with a purple cloth, crowned it, and
carrying it on the point of a spear, buried it under the roots of
Olympus. These mysteries are, in short, murders and funerals. And the
priests of these rites, who are called kings of the sacred rites by
those whose business it is to name them, give additional strangeness to
the tragic occurrence, by forbidding parsley with the roots from being
placed on the table, for they think that parsley grew from the
Corybantic blood that flowed forth; just as the women, in celebrating
the Thesmophoria, abstain from eating the seeds of the pomegranate which
have fallen on the ground, from the idea that pomegranates sprang from
the drops of the blood of Dionysus. Those Corybantes also they call
Cabiric; and the ceremony itself they announce as the Cabiric mystery.

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p21"></span>For those two identical fratricides,
having abstracted the box in which the phallus of Bacchus was deposited,
took it to Etruria—dealers in honourable wares truly. They lived there
as exiles, employing themselves in communicating the precious teaching
of their superstition, and presenting phallic symbols and the box for
the Tyrrhenians to worship. And some will have it, not improbably, that
for this reason Dionysus was called Attis, because he was mutilated. And
what is surprising at the Tyrrhenians, who were barbarians, being thus
initiated into these foul indignities, when among the Athenians, and in
the whole of Greece—I blush to say it—the shameful legend about Demeter
holds its ground? For Demeter, wandering in quest of her daughter Core,
broke down with fatigue near Eleusis, a place in Attica, and sat down on
a well overwhelmed with grief. This is even now prohibited to those who
are initiated, lest they should appear to mimic the weeping goddess. The
indigenous inhabitants then occupied Eleusis: their names were Baubo,
and Dusaules, and Triptolemus; and besides, Eumolpus and Eubouleus.
Triptolemus was a herdsman, Eumolpus a shepherd, and Eubouleus a
swineherd; from whom came the race of the Eumolpidæ and that of the
Heralds—a race of Hierophants—who flourished at Athens.

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p22"></span>Well, then (for I shall not refrain from
the recital), Baubo having received Demeter hospitably, reaches to her a
refreshing draught; and on her refusing it, not having any inclination
to drink (for she was very sad), and Baubo having become annoyed,
thinking herself slighted, uncovered her shame, and exhibited her nudity
to the goddess. Demeter is delighted at the sight, and takes, though
with difficulty, the draught—pleased, <span id="page_177">p. 177</span>
<span id="vi.ii.ii-Page_177"></span>I repeat, at the spectacle. These
are the secret mysteries of the Athenians; these Orpheus records. I
shall produce the very words of Orpheus, that you may have the great
authority on the mysteries himself, as evidence for this piece of
turpitude:—

> <span id="vi.ii.ii-p22.1"></span> “Having thus spoken, she drew aside
> her garments,  
> And showed all that shape of the body which it is improper to name,  
> And with her own hand Baubo stripped herself under the breasts.  
> Blandly then the goddess laughed and laughed in her mind,  
> And received the glancing cup in which was the draught.”  

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p23"></span>And the following is the token of the
Eleusinian mysteries: *I have fasted, I have drunk the cup; I have
received from the box; having done, I put it into the basket, and out of
the basket into the chest.* <span id="fr_882"></span>[883](#fn_882.md) Fine
sights truly, and becoming a goddess; mysteries worthy of the night, and
flame, and the magnanimous or rather silly people of the Erechthidæ and
the other Greeks besides, “whom a fate they hope not for awaits after
death.” And in truth against these Heraclitus the Ephesian prophesies,
as “the night-walkers, the magi, the bacchanals, the Lenæn revellers,
the initiated.” These he threatens with what will follow death, and
predicts for them fire. For what are regarded among men as mysteries,
they celebrate sacrilegiously. Law, then, and opinion, are nugatory. And
the mysteries of the dragon are an imposture, which celebrates
religiously mysteries that are no mysteries at all, and observes with a
spurious piety profane rites. What are these mystic chests?—for I must
expose their sacred things, and divulge things not fit for speech. Are
they not sesame cakes, and pyramidal cakes, and globular and flat cakes,
embossed all over, and lumps of salt, and a serpent the symbol of
Dionysus Bassareus? And besides these, are they not pomegranates, and
branches, and rods, and ivy leaves? and besides, round cakes and poppy
seeds? And further, there are the unmentionable symbols of Themis,
marjoram, a lamp, a sword, a woman’s comb, which is a euphemism and
mystic expression for the *muliebria*.

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p25"></span>O unblushing shamelessness! Once on a
time night was silent, a veil for the pleasure of temperate men; but now
for the initiated, the holy night is the tell-tale of the rites of
licentiousness; and the glare of torches reveals vicious indulgences.
Quench the flame, O Hierophant; reverence, O Torch-bearer, the torches.
That light exposes Iacchus; let thy mysteries be honoured, and command
the orgies to be hidden in night and darkness. <span
id="fr_883"></span>[884](#fn_883.md)

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p27"></span>The fire dissembles not; it exposes and
punishes what it is bidden.

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p28"></span>Such are the mysteries of the
Atheists. <span id="fr_884"></span>[885](#fn_884.md) And with reason I call
those Atheists who know not the true God, and pay shameless worship to a
boy torn in pieces by the Titans, and a woman in distress, and to parts
of the body that in truth cannot be mentioned for shame, held fast as
they are in the double impiety, first in that they know not God, not
acknowledging as God Him who truly is; the other and second is the error
of regarding those who exist not, as existing and calling those gods
that have no real existence, or rather no existence at all, who have
nothing but a name. Wherefore the apostle reproves us, saying, “And ye
were strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without
God in the world.” <span id="fr_885"></span>[886](#fn_885.md)

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p31"></span>All honour to that king of the Scythians,
whoever Anacharsis was, who shot with an arrow one of his subjects who
imitated among the Scythians the mystery of the Mother of the gods, as
practiced by the inhabitants of Cyzicus, beating a drum and sounding a
cymbal strung from his neck like a priest of Cybele, condemning him as
having become effeminate among the Greeks, and a teacher of the disease
of effeminacy to the rest of the Cythians.

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p32"></span>Wherefore (for I must by no means conceal
it) I cannot help wondering how Euhemerus of Agrigentum, and Nicanor of
Cyprus, and Diagoras, and Hippo of Melos, and besides these, that
Cyrenian of the name of Theodorus, and numbers of others, who lived a
sober life, and had a clearer insight than the rest of the world into
the prevailing error respecting those gods, were called Atheists; for if
they did not arrive at the knowledge of the truth, they certainly
suspected the error of the common opinion; which suspicion is no
insignificant seed, and becomes the germ of true wisdom. One of these
charges the Egyptians thus: “If you believe them to be gods, do not
mourn or bewail them; and if you mourn and bewail them, do not any more
regard them as gods.” And another, taking an image of Hercules made of
wood (for he happened most likely to be cooking something at home),
said, “Come now, Hercules; now is the time to undergo for us this
thirteenth labour, as you did the twelve for Eurystheus, and make this
ready for Diagoras,” and so cast it into the fire as a log of wood. For
the extremes of ignorance are atheism and superstition, from which we
must endeavour to keep. And do you not see Moses, the hierophant of the
truth, enjoining that no eunuch, or emasculated man, or son of a harlot,
should enter the congregation? By the two first <span id="page_178">p.
178</span> <span id="vi.ii.ii-Page_178"></span>he alludes to the impious
custom by which men were deprived both of divine energy and of their
virility; and by the third, to him who, in place of the only real God,
assumes many gods falsely so called,—as the son of a harlot, in
ignorance of his true father, may claim many putative fathers.

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p33"></span>There was an innate original communion
between men and heaven, obscured through ignorance, but which now at
length has leapt forth instantaneously from the darkness, and shines
resplendent; as has been expressed by one <span
id="fr_886"></span>[887](#fn_886.md) in the following lines:—

> <span id="vi.ii.ii-p34.1"></span> “See’st thou this lofty, this
> boundless ether,  
> Holding the earth in the embrace of its humid arms.”  

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p35"></span>And in these:—

> <span id="vi.ii.ii-p35.1"></span> “O Thou, who makest the earth Thy
> chariot, and in the earth hast Thy seat,  
> Whoever Thou be, baffling our efforts to behold Thee.”  

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p36"></span>And whatever else the sons of the poets
sing.

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p37"></span>But sentiments erroneous, and deviating
from what is right, and certainly pernicious, have turned man, a
creature of heavenly origin, away from the heavenly life, and stretched
him on the earth, by inducing him to cleave to earthly objects. For
some, beguiled by the contemplation of the heavens, and trusting to
their sight alone, while they looked on the motions of the stars,
straightway were seized with admiration, and deified them, calling the
stars gods from their motion (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ii.ii-p37.1"></span>θεός</span> from <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ii.ii-p37.2"></span>θεῖν</span>); and worshipped the sun,—as, for
example, the Indians; and the moon, as the Phrygians. Others, plucking
the benignant fruits of earth-born plants, called grain Demeter, as the
Athenians, and the vine Dionysus, as the Thebans. Others, considering
the penalties of wickedness, deified them, worshipping various forms of
retribution and calamity. Hence the Erinnyes, and the Eumenides, and the
piacular deities, and the judges and avengers of crime, are the
creations of the tragic poets.

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p38"></span>And some even of the philosophers, after
the poets, make idols of forms of the affections in your breasts,—such
as fear, and love, and joy, and hope; as, to be sure, Epimenides of old,
who raised at Athens the altars of Insult and Impudence. Other objects
deified by men take their rise from events, and are fashioned in bodily
shape, such as a Dike, a Clotho, and Lachesis, and Atropos, and
Heimarmene, and Auxo, and Thallo, which are Attic goddesses. There is a
sixth mode of introducing error and of manufacturing gods, according to
which they number the twelve gods, whose birth is the theme of which
Hesiod sings in his Theogony, and of whom Homer speaks in all that he
says of the gods. The last mode remains (for there are seven in
all)—that which takes its rise from the divine beneficence towards men.
For, not understanding that it is God that does us good, they have
invented saviours in the persons of the Dioscuri, and Hercules the
averter of evil, and Asclepius the healer. These are the slippery and
hurtful deviations from the truth which draw man down from heaven, and
cast him into the abyss. I wish to show thoroughly what like these gods
of yours are, that now at length you may abandon your delusion, and
speed your flight back to heaven. “For we also were once children of
wrath, even as others; but God, being rich in mercy, for the great love
wherewith He loved us, when we were now dead in trespasses, quickened us
together with Christ.” <span id="fr_887"></span>[888](#fn_887.md) For the
Word is living, and having been buried with Christ, is exalted with God.
But those who are still unbelieving are called children of wrath, reared
for wrath. We who have been rescued from error, and restored to the
truth, are no longer the nurslings of wrath. Thus, therefore, we who
were once the children of lawlessness, have through the philanthropy of
the Word now become the sons of God.

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p40"></span>But to you a poet of your own, Empedocles
of Agrigentum, comes and says:—

> <span id="vi.ii.ii-p40.1"></span> “Wherefore, distracted with grievous
> evils,  
> You will never ease your soul of its miserable woes.”  

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p41"></span>The most of what is told of your gods is
fabled and invented; and those things which are supposed to have taken
place, are recorded of vile men who lived licentious lives:—

> <span id="vi.ii.ii-p41.1"></span> “You walk in pride and madness,  
> And leaving the right and straight path, you have gone away  
> Through thorns and briars. Why do ye wander?  
> Cease, foolish men, from mortals;  
> Leave the darkness of night, and lay hold on the light.”  

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p42"></span>These counsels the Sibyl, who is at once
prophetic and poetic, enjoins on us; and truth enjoins them on us too,
stripping the crowd of deities of those terrifying and threatening masks
of theirs, disproving the rash opinions formed of them by showing the
similarity of names. For there are those who reckon three Jupiters: him
of Æther in Arcadia, and the other two sons of Kronos; and of these, one
in Crete, and the others again in Arcadia. And there are those that
reckon five Athenes: the Athenian, the daughter of Hephæstus; the
second, the Egyptian, the daughter of Nilus; the third the inventor of
war, the daughter of Kronos; the fourth, the daughter of Zeus, whom the
Messenians have named Coryphasia, from her mother; above all, the
daughter of Pallas and Titanis, the daughter of Oceanus, who, having
wickedly killed her father, adorned <span id="page_179">p. 179</span>
<span id="vi.ii.ii-Page_179"></span>herself with her father’s skin, as
if it had been the fleece of a sheep. Further, Aristotle calls the first
Apollo, the son of Hephæstus and Athene (consequently Athene is no more
a virgin); the second, that in Crete, the son of Corybas; the third, the
son Zeus; the fourth, the Arcadian, the son of Silenus (this one is
called by the Arcadians Nomius); and in addition to these, he specifies
the Libyan Apollo, the son of Ammon; and to these Didymus the grammarian
adds a sixth, the son of Magnes. And now how many Apollos are there?
They are numberless, mortal men, all helpers of their fellow-men who
similarly with those already mentioned have been so called. And what
were I to mention the many Asclepiuses, or all the Mercuries that are
reckoned up, or the Vulcans of fable? Shall I not appear extravagant,
deluging your ears with these numerous names?

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p43"></span>At any rate, the native countries of your
gods, and their arts and lives, and besides especially their sepulchres,
demonstrate them to have been men. Mars, accordingly, who by the poets
is held in the highest possible honour:—

> <span id="vi.ii.ii-p43.1"></span> “Mars, Mars, bane of men,
> blood-stained stormer of walls,” <span
> id="fr_888"></span>[889](#fn_888.md) —  

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p45"></span>this deity, always changing sides, and
implacable, as Epicharmus says, was a Spartan; Sophocles knew him for a
Thracian; others say he was an Arcadian. This god, Homer says, was bound
thirteen months:—

> <span id="vi.ii.ii-p45.1"></span> “Mars had his suffering; by Alöeus’
> sons,  
> Otus and Ephialtes, strongly bound,  
> He thirteen months in brazen fetters lay.” <span
> id="fr_889"></span>[890](#fn_889.md)  

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p47"></span>Good luck attend the Carians, who
sacrifice dogs to him! And may the Scythians never leave off sacrificing
asses, as Apollodorus and Callimachus relate:—

> <span id="vi.ii.ii-p47.1"></span> “Phœbus rises propitious to the
> Hyperboreans,  
> Then they offer sacrifices of asses to him.”  

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p48"></span>And the same in another place:—

> <span id="vi.ii.ii-p48.1"></span> “Fat sacrifices of asses’ flesh
> delight Phœbus.”  

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p49"></span>Hephæstus, whom Jupiter cast from
Olympus, from its divine threshold, having fallen on Lemnos, practiced
the art of working in brass, maimed in his feet:—

> <span id="vi.ii.ii-p49.1"></span> “His tottering knees were bowed
> beneath his weight.” <span id="fr_890"></span>[891](#fn_890.md)  

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p51"></span>You have also a doctor, and not only a
brass-worker among the gods. And the doctor was greedy of gold;
Asclepius was his name. I shall produce as a witness your own poet, the
Bœotian Pindar:—

> <span id="vi.ii.ii-p51.1"></span> “Him even the gold glittering in his
> hands,  
> Amounting to a splendid fee, persuaded  
> To rescue a man, already death’s capture, from his grasp;  
> But Saturnian Jove, having shot his bolt through both,  
> Quickly took the breath from their breasts,  
> And his flaming thunderbolt sealed their doom.”  

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p52"></span>And Euripides:—

> <span id="vi.ii.ii-p52.1"></span> “For Zeus was guilty of the murder
> of my son  
> Asclepius, by casting the lightning flame at his breast.”  

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p53"></span>He therefore lies struck with lightning
in the regions of Cynosuris. Philochorus also says, that Poseidon was
worshipped as a physician in Tenos; and that Kronos settled in Sicily,
and there was buried. Patroclus the Thurian, and Sophocles the younger,
in three tragedies, have told the story of the Dioscuri; and these
Dioscuri were only two mortals, if Homer is worthy of of credit:—

> <span id="vi.ii.ii-p53.1"></span> “  .  .  .  .  .  . but they beneath
> the teeming earth,  
> In Lacedæmon lay, their native land.” <span
> id="fr_891"></span>[892](#fn_891.md)  

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p55"></span>And, in addition, he who wrote the
Cyprian poems says Castor was mortal, and death was decreed to him by
fate; but Pollux was immortal, being the progeny of Mars. This he has
poetically fabled. But Homer is more worthy of credit, who spoke as
above of both the Dioscuri; and, besides, proved Herucles to be a mere
phantom:—

> <span id="vi.ii.ii-p55.1"></span> “The man Hercules, expert in mighty
> deeds.”  

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p56"></span>Hercules, therefore, was known by Homer
himself as only a mortal man. And Hieronymus the philosopher describes
the make of his body, as tall, <span id="fr_892"></span>[893](#fn_892.md)
bristling-haired, robust; and Dicærchus says that he was square-built,
muscular, dark, hook-nosed, with greyish eyes and long hair. This
Hercules, accordingly, after living fifty-two years, came to his end,
and was burned in a funeral pyre in Œta.

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p58"></span>As for the Muses, whom Alcander calls the
daughters of Zeus and Mnemosyne, and the rest of the poets and authors
deify and worship,—those Muses, in honour of whom whole states have
already erected museums, being handmaids, were hired by Megaclo, the
daughter of Macar. This Macar reigned over the Lesbians, and was always
quarrelling with his wife; and Megaclo was vexed for her mother’s sake.
What would she not do on her account? Accordingly she hires those
handmaids, being so many in number, and calls them Mysæ, according to
the dialect of the Æolians. These she taught to sing deeds of the olden
time, and play melodiously on the lyre. And they, by assiduously playing
the lyre, and singing sweetly to it, soothed Macar, and put a stop to
his ill-temper. Wherefore Megaclo, as a token of gratitude to them, on
her mother’s account erected brazen pillars, and ordered them to be held
in honour in all the temples. Such, then, are the Muses. This account is
in Myrsilus of Lesbos.

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span> <span id="vi.ii.ii-Page_180"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p59"></span>And now, then, hear the loves of your
gods, and the incredible tales of their licentiousness, and their
wounds, and their bonds, and their laughings, and their fights, their
servitudes too, and their banquets; and furthermore, their embraces, and
tears, and sufferings, and lewd delights. Call me Poseidon, and the
troop of damsels deflowered by him, Amphitrite, Amymone, Alope,
Melanippe, Alcyone, Hippothoe, Chione, and myriads of others; with whom,
though so many, the passions of your Poseidon were not satiated.

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p60"></span>Call me Apollo; this is Phœbus, both a
holy prophet and a good adviser. But Sterope will not say that, nor
Æthousa, nor Arsinoe, nor Zeuxippe, nor Prothoe, nor Marpissa, nor
Hypsipyle. For Daphne alone escaped the prophet and seduction.

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p61"></span>And, above all, let the father of gods
and men, according to you, himself come, who was so given to sexual
pleasure, as to lust after all, and indulge his lust on all, like the
goats of the Thmuitæ. And thy poems, O Homer, fill me with admiration!

> <span id="vi.ii.ii-p61.1"></span> “He said, and nodded with his
> shadowy brows;  
> Waved on the immortal head the ambrosial locks,  
> And all Olympus trembled at his nod.” <span
> id="fr_893"></span>[894](#fn_893.md)  

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p63"></span>Thou makest Zeus venerable, O Homer; and
the nod which thou dost ascribe to him is most reverend. But show him
only a woman’s girdle, and Zeus is exposed, and his locks are
dishonoured. To what a pitch of licentiousness did that Zeus of yours
proceed, who spent so many nights in voluptuousness with Alcmene? For
not even these nine nights were long to this insatiable monster. But, on
the contrary, a whole lifetime were short enough for his lust; that he
might beget for us the evil-averting god.

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p64"></span>Hercules, the son of Zeus—a true son of
Zeus—was the offspring of that long night, who with hard toil
accomplished the twelve labours in a long time, but in one night
deflowered the fifty daughters of Thestius, and thus was at once the
debaucher and the bridegroom of so many virgins. It is not, then,
without reason that the poets call him a cruel wretch and a nefarious
scoundrel. It were tedious to recount his adulteries of all sorts, and
debauching of boys. For your gods did not even abstain from boys, one
having loved Hylas, another Hyacinthus, another Pelops, another
Chrysippus, and another Ganymede. Let such gods as these be worshipped
by your wives, and let them pray that their husbands be such as these—so
temperate; that, emulating them in the same practices, they may be like
the gods. Such gods let your boys be trained to worship, that they may
grow up to be men with the accursed likeness of fornication on them
received from the gods.

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p65"></span>But it is only the male deities, perhaps,
that are impetuous in sexual indulgence.

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p66"></span>“The female deities stayed each in the
house, for shame,” <span id="fr_894"></span>[895](#fn_894.md) says Homer;
the goddesses blushing, for modesty’s sake, to look on Aphrodité when
she had been guilty of adultery. But these are more passionately
licentious, bound in the chains of adultery; Eos having disgraced
herself with Tithonus, Selene with Endymion, Nereis with Æacus, Thetis
with Peleus, Demeter with Jason, Persephatta with Adonis. And Aphrodité
having disgraced herself with Ares, crossed over to Cinyra and married
Anchises, and laid snares for Phaëthon, and loved Adonis. She contended
with the ox-eyed Juno; and the goddesses un-robed for the sake of the
apple, and presented themselves naked before the shepherd, that he might
decide which was the fairest.

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p68"></span>But come, let us briefly go the round of
the games, and do away with those solemn assemblages at tombs, the
Isthmian, Nemean, and Pythian, and finally the Olympian. At Pytho the
Pythian dragon is worshipped, and the festival-assemblage of the serpent
is called by the name Pythia. At the Isthmus the sea spit out a piece of
miserable refuse; and the Isthmian games bewail Melicerta.

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p69"></span>At Nemea another—a little boy,
Archemorus—was buried; and the funeral games of the child are called
Nemea. Pisa is the grave of the Phrygian charioteer, O Hellenes of all
tribes; and the Olympian games, which are nothing else than the funeral
sacrifices of Pelops, the Zeus of Phidias claims for himself. The
mysteries were then, as is probable, games held in honour of the dead;
so also were the oracles, and both became public. But the mysteries at
Sagra <span id="fr_895"></span>[896](#fn_895.md) and in Alimus of Attica
were confined to Athens. But those contests and *phalloi* consecrated to
Dionysus were a world’s shame, pervading life with their deadly
influence. For Dionysus, eagerly desiring to descend to Hades, did not
know the way; a man, by name Prosymnus, offers to tell him, not without
reward. The reward was a disgraceful one, though not so in the opinion
of Dionysus: it was an Aphrodisian favour that was asked of Dionysus as
a reward. The god was not reluctant to grant the request made to him,
and promises to fulfil it should he return, and confirms his promise
with an oath. Having learned the way, he departed and again returned: he
did not find Prosymnus, for he had died. In order to acquit himself of
his promise to his lover, he rushes to his tomb, and burns with
unnatural lust. Cutting a fig-branch that came to his hand, he shaped
the phallus, and so performed his promise to the dead man. As a mystic
memorial of this incident, *phalloi* are <span id="page_181">p.
181</span> <span id="vi.ii.ii-Page_181"></span>raised aloft in honour of
Dionysus through the various cities. “For did they not make a procession
in honour of Dionysus, and sing most shameless songs in honour of the
pudenda, all would go wrong,” says Heraclitus. This is that Pluto and
Dionysus in whose honour they give themselves up to frenzy, and play the
bacchanal,—not so much, in my opinion, for the sake of intoxication, as
for the sake of the shameless ceremonial practiced. With reason,
therefore, such as have become slaves of their passions are your gods!

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p71"></span>Furthermore, like the Helots among the
Lacedemonians, Apollo came under the yoke of slavery to Admetus in
Pheræ, Hercules to Omphale in Sardis. Poseidon was a drudge to Laomedon;
and so was Apollo, who, like a good-for-nothing servant, was unable to
obtain his freedom from his former master; and at that time the walls of
Troy were built by them for the Phrygian. And Homer is not ashamed to
speak of Athene as appearing to Ulysses with a golden lamp in her hand.
And we read of Aphrodite, like a wanton serving-wench, taking and
setting a seat for Helen opposite the adulterer, in order to entice him.

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p72"></span>Panyasis, too, tells us of gods in plenty
besides those who acted as servants, writing thus:—

> <span id="vi.ii.ii-p72.1"></span> “Demeter underwent servitude, and so
> did the famous lame god;  
> Poseidon underwent it, and Apollo too, of the silver bow,  
> With a mortal man for a year. And fierce Mars  
> Underwent it at the compulsion of his father.”  

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p73"></span>And so on.

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p74"></span>Agreeably to this, it remains for me to
bring before you those amatory and sensuous deities of yours, as in
every respect having human feelings.

> <span id="vi.ii.ii-p74.1"></span> “For theirs was a mortal body.”  

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p75"></span>This Homer most distinctly shows, by
introducing Aphrodite uttering loud and shrill cries on account of her
wound; and describing the most warlike Ares himself as wounded in the
stomach by Diomede. Polemo, too, says that Athene was wounded by
Ornytus; nay, Homer says that Pluto even was struck with an arrow by
Hercules; and Panyasis relates that the beams of Sol were struck by the
arrows of Hercules; <span id="fr_896"></span>[897](#fn_896.md) and the same
Panyasis relates, that by the same Hercules Hera the goddess of marriage
was wounded in sandy Pylos. Sosibius, too, relates that Hercules was
wounded in the hand by the sons of Hippocoon. And if there are wounds,
there is blood. For the *ichor* of the poets is more repulsive than
blood; for the putrefaction of blood is called *ichor*. Wherefore cures
and means of sustenance of which they stand in need must be furnished.
Accordingly mention is made of tables, and potations, and laughter, and
intercourse; for men would not devote themselves to love, or beget
children, or sleep, if they were immortal, and had no wants, and never
grew old. Jupiter himself, when the guest of Lycaon the Arcadian,
partook of a human table among the Ethiopians—a table rather inhuman and
forbidden. For he satiated himself with human flesh unwittingly; for the
god did not know that Lycaon the Arcadian, his entertainer, had slain
his son (his name was Nyctimus), and served him up cooked before Zeus.

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p77"></span>This is Jupiter the good, the prophetic,
the patron of hospitality, the protector of suppliants, the benign, the
author of omens, the avenger of wrongs; rather the unjust, the violater
of right and of law, the impious, the inhuman, the violent, the seducer,
the adulterer, the amatory. But perhaps when he was such he was a man;
but now these fables seem to have grown old on our hands. Zeus is no
longer a serpent, a swan, nor an eagle, nor a licentious man; the god no
longer flies, nor loves boys, nor kisses, nor offers violence, although
there are still many beautiful women, more comely than Leda, more
blooming than Semele, and boys of better looks and manners than the
Phrygian herdsman. Where is now that eagle? where now that swan? where
now is Zeus himself? He has grown old with his feathers; for as yet he
does not repent of his amatory exploits, nor is he taught continence.
The fable is exposed before you: Leda is dead, the swan is dead. Seek
your Jupiter. Ransack not heaven, but earth. The Cretan, in whose
country he was buried, will show him to you,—I mean Callimachus, in his
hymns:—

> <span id="vi.ii.ii-p77.1"></span> “For thy tomb, O king,  
> The Cretans fashioned!”  

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p78"></span>For Zeus is dead, be not distressed, as
Leda is dead, and the swan, and the eagle, and the libertine, and the
serpent. And now even the superstitious seem, although reluctantly, yet
truly, to have come to understand their error respecting the Gods.

> <span id="vi.ii.ii-p78.1"></span> “For not from an ancient oak, nor
> from a rock,  
> But from men, is thy descent.” <span
> id="fr_897"></span>[898](#fn_897.md)  

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p80"></span>But shortly after this, they will be
found to be but oaks and stones. One Agamemnon is said by Staphylus to
be worshipped as a Jupiter in Sparta; and Phanocles, in his book of the
*Brave and Fair*, relates that Agamemnon king of the Hellenes erected
the temple of Argennian Aphrodite, in honour of Argennus his friend. An
Artemis, named the Strangled, is worshipped by the Arcadians, as
Callimachus says in his *Book of Causes;* and at Methymna another
Artemis had divine honours paid her, viz., Artemis Condylitis. <span
id="page_182">p. 182</span> <span id="vi.ii.ii-Page_182"></span>There is
also the temple of another Artemis—Artemis Podagra (or, the gout)—in
Laconica, as Sosibius says. Polemo tells of an image of a yawning
Apollo; and again of another image, reverenced in Elis, of the guzzling
Apollo. Then the Eleans sacrifice to Zeus, the averter of flies; and the
Romans sacrifice to Hercules, the averter of flies; and to Fever, and to
Terror, whom also they reckon among the attendants of Hercules. (I pass
over the Argives, who worshipped Aphrodite, opener of graves.) The
Argives and Spartans reverence Artemis Chelytis, or the cougher, from
<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.ii.ii-p80.1"></span>κελύττειν</span>,
which in their speech signifies to cough.

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p81"></span>Do you imagine from what source these
details have been quoted? Only such as are furnished by yourselves are
here adduced; and you do not seem to recognise your own writers, whom I
call as witnesses against your unbelief. Poor wretches that ye are, who
have filled with unholy jesting the whole compass of your life—a life in
reality devoid of life!

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p82"></span>Is not Zeus the Baldhead worshipped in
Argos; and another Zeus, the avenger, in Cyprus? Do not the Argives
sacrifice to Aphrodite Peribaso (the protectress), <span
id="fr_898"></span>[899](#fn_898.md) and the Athenians to Aphrodite Hetæra
(the courtesan), and the Syracusans to Aphrodite Kallipygos, whom
Nicander has somewhere called Kalliglutos (with beautiful rump). I pass
over in silence just now Dionysus Choiropsales. <span
id="fr_899"></span>[900](#fn_899.md) The Sicyonians reverence this deity,
whom they have constituted the god of the muliebria—the patron of
filthiness—and religiously honour as the author of licentiousness. Such,
then, are their gods; such are they also who make mockery of the gods,
or rather mock and insult themselves. How much better are the Egyptians,
who in their towns and villages pay divine honours to the irrational
creatures, than the Greeks, who worship such gods as these?

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p85"></span>For if they are beasts, they are not
adulterous or libidinous, and seek pleasure in nothing that is contrary
to nature. And of what sort these deities are, what need is there
further to say, as they have been already sufficiently exposed?
Furthermore, the Egyptians whom I have now mentioned are divided in
their objects of worship. The Syenites worship the braize-fish; and the
maiotes—this is another fish—is worshipped by those who inhabit
Elephantine: the Oxyrinchites likewise worship a fish which takes its
name from their country. Again, the Heraclitopolites worship the
ichneumon, the inhabitants of Sais and of Thebes a sheep, the
Leucopolites a wolf, the Cynopolites a dog, the Memphites Apis, the
Mendesians a goat. And you, who are altogether better than the Egyptians
(I shrink from saying worse), who never cease laughing every day of your
lives at the Egyptians, what are some of you, too, with regard to brute
beasts? For of your number the Thessalians pay divine homage to storks,
in accordance with ancient custom; and the Thebans to weasels, for their
assistance at the birth of Hercules. And again, are not the Thessalians
reported to worship ants, since they have learned that Zeus in the
likeness of an ant had intercourse with Eurymedusa, the daughter of
Cletor, and begot Myrmidon? Polemo, too, relates that the people who
inhabit the Troad worship the mice of the country, which they call
Sminthoi, because they gnawed the strings of their enemies’ bows; and
from those mice Apollo has received his epithet of Sminthian.
Heraclides, in his work, *Regarding the Building of Temples in
Acarnania*, says that, at the place where the promontory of Actium is,
and the temple of Apollo of Actium, they offer to the flies the
sacrifice of an ox.

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p86"></span>Nor shall I forget the Samians: the
Samians, as Euphorion says, reverence the sheep. Nor shall I forget the
Syrians, who inhabit Phœnicia, of whom some revere doves, and others
fishes, with as excessive veneration as the Eleans do Zeus. Well, then,
since those you worship are not gods, it seems to me requisite to
ascertain if those are really demons who are ranked, as you say, in this
second order \[next to the gods\]. For if the lickerish and impure are
demons, indigenous demons who have obtained sacred honours may be
discovered in crowds throughout your cities: Menedemus among the
Cythnians; among the Tenians, Callistagoras; among the Delians, Anius;
among the Laconians, Astrabacus; at Phalerus, a hero affixed to the prow
of ships is worshipped; and the Pythian priestess enjoined the Platæans
to sacrifice to Androcrates and Democrates, and Cyclæus and Leuco while
the Median war was at its height. Other demons in plenty may be brought
to light by any one who can look about him a little.

> <span id="vi.ii.ii-p86.1"></span> “For thrice ten thousand are there
> in the all-nourishing earth  
> Of demons immortal, the guardians of articulate-speaking men.” <span
> id="fr_900"></span>[901](#fn_900.md)  

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p88"></span>Who these guardians are, do not grudge, O
Bœotian, to tell. Is it not clear that they are those we have mentioned,
and those of more renown, the great demons, Apollo, Artemis, Leto,
Demeter, Core, Pluto, Hercules, and Zeus himself?

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p89"></span>But it is from running away that they
guard us, O Ascræan, or perhaps it is from sinning, as forsooth they
have never tried their hand at sin <span id="page_183">p. 183</span>
<span id="vi.ii.ii-Page_183"></span>themselves! In that case verily the
proverb may fitly be uttered:—

> <span id="vi.ii.ii-p89.1"></span> “The father who took no admonition
> admonishes his son.”  

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p90"></span>If these are our guardians, it is not
because they have any ardour of kindly feeling towards us, but intent on
your ruin, after the manner of flatterers, they prey on your substance,
enticed by the smoke. These demons themselves indeed confess their own
gluttony, saying:—

> <span id="vi.ii.ii-p90.1"></span> “For with drink-offerings due, and
> fat of lambs,  
> My altar still hath at their hands been fed;  
> Such honour hath to us been ever paid.” <span
> id="fr_901"></span>[902](#fn_901.md)  

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p92"></span>What other speech would they utter, if
indeed the gods of the Egyptians, such as cats and weasels, should
receive the faculty of speech, than that Homeric and poetic one which
proclaims their liking for savoury odours and cookery? Such are your
demons and gods, and demigods, if there are any so called, as there are
demi-asses (mules); for you have no want of terms to make up compound
names of impiety.
