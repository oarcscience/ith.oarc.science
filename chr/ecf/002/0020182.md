##### <span id="v.ii.xii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XII.—Consequent Absurdity of the Charge of Atheism.

<span id="v.ii.xii-p1"></span>Should we, then, unless we believed that a
God presides over the human race, thus purge ourselves from evil? Most
certainly not. But, because we are persuaded that we shall give an
account of everything in the present life to God, who made us and the
world, we adopt a temperate and benevolent and generally despised method
of life, believing that we shall suffer no such great evil here, even
should our lives be taken from us, compared with what we shall there
receive for our meek and benevolent and moderate life from the great
Judge. Plato indeed has said that Minos and Rhadamanthus will judge and
punish the wicked; but we say that, even if a man be Minos or
Rhadamanthus himself, or their father, even he will not escape the
judgment of God. Are, then, those who consider life to be comprised in
this, “Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die,” and who regard death
as a deep sleep and forgetfulness (“sleep and death, twin
brothers” <span id="fr_734"></span>[735](#fn_734) .md), to be accounted
pious; while men who reckon the present life of very small worth indeed,
and who are conducted to the future life by this one thing alone, that
they know God and His Logos, what is the oneness of the Son with the
Father, what the communion of the Father with the Son, what is the
Spirit, what is the unity of these three, the Spirit, the Son, the
Father, and their distinction in unity; and who know that the life for
which we look is far better than can be described in words, provided we
arrive at it pure from all wrong-doing; who, moreover, carry our
benevolence to such an extent, that we not only love our friends (“for
if ye love them,” He says, “that love you, and lend to them that lend to
you, what reward will ye have?” <span id="fr_735"></span>[736](#fn_735.md)
),—shall we, I say, when such is our character, and when we live such a
life as this, that we may escape condemnation at last, not be accounted
pious? These, however, are only small matters taken from great, and a
few things from many, that we may not further trespass on your patience;
for those who test honey and whey, judge by a small quantity whether the
whole is good.
