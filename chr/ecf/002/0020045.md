##### <span id="iii.ii.ix-p0.1"></span>Chapter IX.—They Give Rise to Superstitions.

<span id="iii.ii.ix-p1"></span>Such are the demons; these are they who
laid down the doctrine of Fate. Their fundamental principle was the
placing of animals in the heavens. For the creeping things on the earth,
and those that swim in the waters, and the quadrupeds on the mountains,
with which they lived when expelled from heaven,—these they dignified
with celestial honour, in order that they might themselves be thought to
remain in heaven, and, by placing the constellations there, might make
to appear rational the irrational course of life on earth. <span
id="fr_444"></span>[445](#fn_444.md) Thus the high-spirited and he who is
crushed with toil, the temperate and the intemperate, the indigent and
the wealthy, are what they are simply from the controllers of their
nativity. For the delineation of the zodiacal circle is the work of
gods. And, when the light of one of them predominates, as they express
it, it deprives all the rest <span id="page_69">p. 69</span> <span
id="iii.ii.ix-Page_69"></span>of their honour; and he who now is
conquered, at another time gains the predominance. And the seven planets
are well pleased with them, <span id="fr_445"></span>[446](#fn_445.md) as
if they were amusing themselves with dice. But we are superior to Fate,
and instead of wandering (<span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.ii.ix-p3.1"></span>πλανητῶν</span>) demons, we have learned to
know one Lord who wanders not; and, as we do not follow the guidance of
Fate, we reject its lawgivers. Tell me, I adjure you, <span
id="fr_446"></span>[447](#fn_446.md) did Triptolemus sow wheat and prove a
benefactor to the Athenians after their sorrow? And why was not Demeter,
before she lost her daughter, a benefactress to men? The Dog of Erigone
is shown in the heavens, and the Scorpion the helper of Artemis, and
Chiron the Centaur, and the divided Argo, and the Bear of Callisto. Yet
how, before these performed the aforesaid deeds, were the heavens
unadorned? And to whom will it not appear ridiculous that the
Deltotum <span id="fr_447"></span>[448](#fn_447.md) should be placed among
the stars, according to some, on account of Sicily, or, as others say,
on account of the first letter in the name of Zeus (<span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.ii.ix-p5.2"></span>Διός</span>)? For why are
not Sardinia and Cyprus honoured in heaven? And why have not the letters
of the names of the brothers of Zeus, who shared the kingdom with him,
been fixed there too? And how is it that Kronos, who was put in chains
and ejected from his kingdom, is constituted a manager <span
id="fr_448"></span>[449](#fn_448.md) of Fate? How, too, can he give
kingdoms who no longer reigns himself? Reject, then, these absurdities,
and do not become transgressors by hating us unjustly.
