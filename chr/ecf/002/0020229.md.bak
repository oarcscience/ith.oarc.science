##### <span id="v.iii.xxi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXI.—Continuation of the Argument.

<span id="v.iii.xxi-p1"></span>For if good deeds are rewarded, the body
will clearly be wronged, inasmuch as it has shared with the soul in the
toils connected with well-doing, but does not share in the reward of the
good deeds, and because, though the soul is often excused for certain
faults on the ground of the body’s neediness and want, the body itself
is deprived of all share in the good deeds done, the toils on behalf of
which it helped to bear during life. Nor, again, if faults are judged,
is the soul dealt fairly with, supposing it alone to pay the penalty for
the faults it committed through being solicited by the body and drawn
away by it to its own appetites and motions, at one time being seized
upon and carried off, at another attracted in some very violent manner,
and sometimes concurring with it by way of kindness and attention to its
preservation. How can it possibly be other than unjust for the soul to
be judged by itself in respect of things towards which in its own nature
it feels no appetite, no motion, no impulse, such as licentiousness,
violence, covetousness, injustice, and the unjust acts arising out of
these? For if the majority of such evils come from men’s not having the
mastery of the passions which solicit them, and they are solicited by
the neediness and want of the body, and the care and attention required
by it (for these are the motives for every acquisition of property, and
especially for the using of it, and moreover for marriage and all the
actions of life, in which things, and in connection with which, is seen
what is faulty and what is not so), how can it be just for the soul
alone to be judged in respect of those things which the body is the
first to be sensible of, and in which it draws the soul away to sympathy
and participation in actions with a view to things which it wants; and
that the appetites and pleasures, and moreover the fears and sorrows, in
which whatever exceeds the proper bounds is amenable to judgment, should
be set in motion by the body, and yet that the sins arising from these,
and the punishments for the sins committed, should fall upon the soul
alone, which neither needs anything of this sort, nor desires nor fears
or suffers of itself any such thing as man is wont to suffer? But even
if we hold that these affections do not pertain to the body alone, but
to man, in saying which we should speak correctly, because the life of
man is one, though composed of the two, yet surely we shall not assert
that these things belong to the soul, if we only look simply at its
peculiar nature. For if it is absolutely without need of food, it can
never desire those things which it does not <span id="page_161">p.
161</span> <span id="v.iii.xxi-Page_161"></span>in the least require for
its subsistence; nor can it feel any impulse towards any of those things
which it is not at all fitted to use; nor, again, can it be grieved at
the want of money or other property, since these are not suited to it.
And if, too, it is superior to corruption, it fears nothing whatever as
destructive of itself: it has no dread of famine, or disease, or
mutilation, or blemish, or fire, or sword, since it cannot suffer from
any of these any hurt or pain, because neither bodies nor bodily powers
touch it at all. But if it is absurd to attach the passions to the soul
as belonging specially to it, it is in the highest degree unjust and
unworthy of the judgment of God to lay upon the soul alone the sins
which spring from them, and the consequent punishments.
