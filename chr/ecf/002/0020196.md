##### <span id="v.ii.xxvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXVI.—The Demons Allure Men to the Worship of Images.

<span id="v.ii.xxvi-p1"></span>They who draw men to idols, then, are the
aforesaid demons, who are eager for the blood of the sacrifices, and
lick them; but the gods that please the multitude, and whose names are
given to the images, were men, as may be learned from their history. And
that it is the demons who act under their names, is proved by the nature
of their operations. For some castrate, as Rhea; others wound and
slaughter, as Artemis; the Tauric goddess puts all strangers to death. I
pass over those who lacerate with knives and scourges of bones, and
shall not attempt to describe all the kinds of demons; for it is not the
part of a god to incite to things against nature.

> <span id="v.ii.xxvi-p1.1"></span> “But when the demon plots against a
> man,  
> He first inflicts some hurt upon his mind.” <span
> id="fr_794"></span>[795](#fn_794.md)  

<span id="v.ii.xxvi-p3"></span>But God, being perfectly good, is
eternally doing good. That, moreover, those who exert the power are not
the same as those to whom the statues are erected, very strong evidence
is afforded by Troas and Parium. The one has statues of Neryllinus, a
man of our own times; and Parium of Alexander and Proteus: both the
sepulchre and the statue of Alexander are still in the forum. The other
statues of Neryllinus, then, are a public ornament, if indeed a city can
be adorned by such objects as these; but one of them is supposed to
utter oracles and to heal the sick, and on this account the people of
the Troad offer sacrifices to this statue, and overlay it with gold, and
hang chaplets upon it. But of the statues of Alexander and Proteus (the
latter, you are aware, threw himself into the fire near Olympia), that
of Proteus is likewise said to utter oracles; and to that of Alexander—

> <span id="v.ii.xxvi-p3.1"></span> “Wretched Paris, though in form so
> fair,  
> Thou slave of woman” <span id="fr_795"></span>[796](#fn_795.md) —  

<span id="v.ii.xxvi-p5"></span>sacrifices are offered and festivals are
held at the public cost, as to a god who can hear. Is it, then,
Neryllinus, and Proteus, and Alexander who exert these energies in
connection with the statues, or is it the nature of the matter itself?
But the matter is brass. And what can brass do of itself, which may be
made again into a different form, as Amasis treated the footpan, <span
id="fr_796"></span>[797](#fn_796.md) as told by Herodotus? And Neryllinus,
and Proteus, and Alexander, what good are they to the sick? For what the
image is said now to effect, it effected when Neryllinus was alive and
sick.
