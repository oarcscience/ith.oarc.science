<span id="ii.iv.iii-p1"></span>He showed me many trees having no leaves,
<span id="page_33">p. 33</span> <span id="ii.iv.iii-Page_33"></span>but
withered, as it seemed to me; for all were alike. And he said to me, “Do
you see those trees?” “I see, sir,” I replied, “that all are alike, and
withered.” He answered me, and said, “These trees which you see are
those who dwell in this world.” “Why, then, sir,” I said, “are they
withered, as it were, and alike?” <span
id="fr_257"></span>[258](#fn_257.md) “Because,” he said, “neither are the
righteous manifest in this life, nor sinners, but they are alike; for
this life is a winter to the righteous, and they do not manifest
themselves, because they dwell with sinners: for as in winter trees that
have cast their leaves are alike, and it is not seen which are dead and
which are living, so in this world neither do the righteous show
themselves, nor sinners, but all are alike one to another.” <span

from Withered by Fruit and Living Leaves, So in the World to Come the
Just Differ from the Unjust in Happiness.](0020026.md)
