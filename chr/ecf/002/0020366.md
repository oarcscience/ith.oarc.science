##### <span id="vi.iv.iv.xv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVI.—Passages of Scripture Respecting the Constancy, Patience, and Love of the Martyrs.

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xv-p1"></span>“With the heart man believeth unto
righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.
Wherefore the Scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on Him shall not be
ashamed; that is, the word of faith which we preach: for if thou confess
the word with thy mouth that Jesus is Lord, and believe in thy heart
that God hath raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.” <span
id="fr_2817"></span>[2818](#fn_2817.md) There is clearly described the
perfect righteousness, fulfilled both in practice and contemplation.
Wherefore we are “to bless those who persecute us. Bless, and curse
not.” <span id="fr_2818"></span>[2819](#fn_2818.md) “For our rejoicing is
this, the testimony of a good conscience, that in holiness and sincerity
we know God” by this inconsiderable instance exhibiting the work of
love, that “not in fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had
our conversation in the world.” <span
id="fr_2819"></span>[2820](#fn_2819.md) So far the apostle respecting
knowledge; and in the second Epistle to the Corinthians he calls the
common “teaching of faith” the savour of knowledge. “For unto this day
the same veil remains on many in the reading of the Old
Testament,” <span id="fr_2820"></span>[2821](#fn_2820.md) not being
uncovered by turning to the Lord. Wherefore also to those capable of
perceiving he showed resurrection, that of the life still in the flesh,
creeping on its belly. Whence also he applied the name “brood of vipers”
to the voluptuous, who serve the belly and the pudenda, and cut off one
another’s heads for the sake of worldly pleasures. “Little children, let
us not love in word, or in tongue,” says John, teaching them to be
perfect, “but in deed and in truth; hereby shall we know that we are of
the truth.” <span id="fr_2821"></span>[2822](#fn_2821.md) And if “God be
love,” piety also is love: “there is no fear in love; but perfect love
casteth out fear.” <span id="fr_2822"></span>[2823](#fn_2822.md) “This is
the love of God, that we keep His commandments.” <span
id="fr_2823"></span>[2824](#fn_2823.md) And again, to him who desires to
become a Gnostic, it is written, “But be thou an example of the
believers, in word, in conversation, in love, in faith, in
purity.” <span id="fr_2824"></span>[2825](#fn_2824.md) For perfection in
faith differs, I think, from ordinary faith. And the divine apostle
furnishes the rule for the Gnostic in these words, writing as follows:
“For I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, to be content. I know
both how to be abased, and I know how to abound. Everywhere and in all
things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound
and to lack. I can do all things through Him who strengtheneth
me.” <span id="fr_2825"></span>[2826](#fn_2825.md) And also when discussing
with others in order to put them, to shame, he does not shrink from
saying, “But call to mind the former days, in which, after ye were
illuminated, ye endured a great fight of <span id="page_428">p.
428</span> <span id="vi.iv.iv.xv-Page_428"></span>afflictions; partly,
whilst ye were made a gazing-stock, both by reproaches and afflictions;
and partly, whilst ye became companions of them that were so used. For
ye had compassion of me in my bonds, and took with joy the spoiling of
your goods, knowing that you have a better and enduring substance. Cast
not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompense of
reward. For ye have need of patience, that, after doing the will of God,
ye may obtain the promise. For yet a little while, and He that cometh
will come, and will not tarry. Now the just shall live by faith: and if
any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him. But we are not
of them that draw back unto perdition, but of them that believe to the
saving of the soul.” <span id="fr_2826"></span>[2827](#fn_2826.md) He then
brings forward a swarm of divine examples. For was it not “by faith,” he
says, this endurance, that they acted nobly who “had trial of mockeries
and scourgings, and, moreover, of bonds and imprisonments? They were
stoned, they were tempted, were slain with the sword. They wandered
about in sheep-skins and goat-skins, being destitute, afflicted,
tormented, of whom the world was not worthy. They wandered in deserts,
in mountains, in dens, and caves of the earth. And all having received a
good report, through faith, received not the promise of God” (what is
expressed by a parasiopesis is left to be understood, viz., “alone”). He
adds accordingly, “God having provided some better thing for us (for He
was good), that they should not without us be made perfect. Wherefore
also, having encompassing us such a cloud,” holy and transparent, “of
witnesses, laying aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily
beset us, let us run with patience the race set before us, looking unto
Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith.” <span
id="fr_2827"></span>[2828](#fn_2827.md) Since, then, he specifies one
salvation in Christ of the righteous, <span
id="fr_2828"></span>[2829](#fn_2828.md) and of us he has expressed the
former unambiguously, and saying nothing less respecting Moses, adds,
“Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of
Egypt: for he had respect to the recompense of the reward. By faith he
forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured as
seeing Him who is invisible.” <span id="fr_2829"></span>[2830](#fn_2829.md)
The divine Wisdom says of the martyrs, “They seemed in the eyes of the
foolish to die, and their departure was reckoned a calamity, and their
migration from us an affliction. But they are in peace. For though in
the sight of men they were punished, their hope was full of
immortality.” <span id="fr_2830"></span>[2831](#fn_2830.md) He then adds,
teaching martyrdom to be a glorious purification, “And being chastened a
little, they shall be benefited much; because God proved them,” that is,
suffered them to be tried, to put them to the proof, and to put to shame
the author of their trial, “and found them worthy of Himself,” plainly
to be called sons. “As gold in the furnace He proved them, and as a
whole burned-offering of sacrifice He accepted them. And in the time of
their visitation they will shine forth, even as sparks run along the
stubble. They shall judge the nations, and rule over the peoples, and
the Lord shall reign over them forever.” <span
id="fr_2831"></span>[2832](#fn_2831.md)
