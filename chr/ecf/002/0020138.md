##### <span id="iv.ii.iii.i-p0.1"></span>Chapter I.—Autolycus Not Yet Convinced.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.i-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.ii.iii.i-p1.1"></span>Theophilus</span> to Autolycus, greeting:
Seeing that writers are fond of composing a multitude of books for
vainglory,—some concerning gods, and wars, and chronology, and some,
too, concerning useless legends, and other such labour in vain, in which
you also have been used to employ yourself until now, and do not grudge
to endure that toil; but though you conversed with me, are still of
opinion that the word of truth is an idle tale, and suppose that our
writings are recent and modern;—on this account I also will not grudge
the labour of compendiously setting forth to you, God helping me, the
antiquity of our books, reminding you of it in few words, that you may
not grudge the labour of reading it, but may recognise the folly of the
other authors.
