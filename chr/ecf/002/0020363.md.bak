##### <span id="vi.iv.iv.xii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIII.—Valentinian’s Vagaries About the Abolition of Death Refuted.

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xii-p1"></span>Valentinian, in a homily, writes in
these words: “Ye are originally immortal, and children of eternal life,
and ye would have death distributed to you, that ye may spend and lavish
it, and that death may die in you and by you; for when we dissolve the
world, and are not yourselves dissolved, ye have dominion over creation
and all corruption.” For he also, similarly with Basilides, supposes a
class saved by nature, and that this different race has come hither to
us from above for the abolition of death, and that the origin of death
is the work of the Creator of the world. Wherefore also he so expounds
that Scripture, “No man shall see the face of God, and live,” as if He
were the cause of death. Respecting this God, he makes those allusions
when writing in these expressions: “As much as the image is inferior to
the living face, so much is the world inferior to the living Æon. What
is, then, the cause of the image? The majesty of the face, which
exhibits the figure to the painter, to be honoured by his name; for the
form is not found exactly to the life, but the name supplies what is
wanting in the effigy. The invisibility of God co-operates also in order
to the faith of that which has been fashioned.” For the Creator, called
God and Father, he designated as “Painter,” and “Wisdom,” whose image
that which is formed is, to the glory of the invisible One; since the
things which proceed from a pair are complements, and those which
proceed from one are images. But since what is seen is no part of Him,
the soul comes from what is intermediate, which is different; and this
is the inspiration of the different spirit, and generally what is
breathed into the soul, which is the image of the spirit. And in
general, what is said of the Creator, who was made according to the
image, they say was foretold by a sensible image in the book of Genesis
respecting the origin of man; and the likeness they transfer to
themselves, teaching that the addition of the different spirit was made;
unknown to the Creator. When, then, we treat of the unity of the God who
is proclaimed in the law, the prophets, and the Gospel, we shall also
discuss this; for the topic is supreme. <span
id="fr_2801"></span>[2802](#fn_2801.md) But we must advance to that which
is urgent. If for the purpose of doing away with death the peculiar race
has come, it is not Christ who has abolished death, unless He also is
said to be of the same essence with them. And if He abolished it to this
end, that it might not touch the peculiar race, it is not these, the
rivals of the Creator, who breathe into the image of their intermediate
spirit the life from above—in accordance with the principle of their
dogma—that abolish death. But should they say that this takes place by
His mother, <span id="fr_2802"></span>[2803](#fn_2802.md) or should they
say that they, along with Christ, war against death, let them own their
secret dogma that they have the hardihood to assail the divine power of
the Creator, by setting to rights His creation, as if they were
superior, endeavouring to save the vital image which He was not able to
rescue from corruption. Then the Lord would be superior to God the
Creator; for the son would never contend with the father, especially
among the gods. But the point that the Creator of all things, the
omnipotent Lord, is the Father of the Son, we have deferred till the
discussion of these points, in which we have undertaken <span
id="page_426">p. 426</span> <span id="vi.iv.iv.xii-Page_426"></span>to
dispute against the heresies, showing that He alone is the God
proclaimed by Him.

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xii-p4"></span>But the apostle, writing to us with
reference to the endurance of afflictions, says, “And this is of God,
that it is given to you on behalf of Christ, not only to believe on Him,
but also to suffer for His sake; having the same conflict which ye saw
in me, and now hear to be in me. If there is therefore any consolation
in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any communion of spirit, if any
bowels and mercies, fulfil ye my joy, that ye may be of the same mind,
having the same love, unanimous, thinking one thing. And if he is
offered on the sacrifice and service of faith, joying and
rejoicing” <span id="fr_2803"></span>[2804](#fn_2803.md) with the
Philippians, to whom the apostle speaks, calling them “fellow-partakers
of joy,” <span id="fr_2804"></span>[2805](#fn_2804.md) how does he say that
they are of one soul, and having a soul? Likewise, also, writing
respecting Timothy and himself, he says, “For I have no one like-souled,
who will nobly care for your state. For all seek their own, not the
things which are Jesus Christ’s.” <span
id="fr_2805"></span>[2806](#fn_2805.md)

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xii-p8"></span>Let not the above-mentioned people,
then, call us, by way of reproach, “natural men” (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.iv.iv.xii-p8.1"></span>ψυκικοί</span>), nor
the Phrygians <span id="fr_2806"></span>[2807](#fn_2806.md) either; for
these now call those who do not apply themselves to the new prophecy
“natural men” (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.iv.xii-p9.1"></span>ψυκικοί</span>), with whom we shall
discuss in our remarks on “Prophecy.” <span
id="fr_2807"></span>[2808](#fn_2807.md) The perfect man ought therefore to
practice love, and thence to haste to the divine friendship, fulfilling
the commandments from love. And loving one’s enemies does not mean
loving wickedness, or impiety, or adultery, or theft; but the thief, the
impious, the adulterer, not as far as he sins, and in respect of the
actions by which he stains the name of man, but as he is a man, and the
work of God. Assuredly sin is an activity, not an existence: and
therefore it is not a work of God. Now sinners are called enemies of
God—enemies, that is, of the commands which they do not obey, as those
who obey become friends, the one named so from their fellowship, the
others from their estrangement, which is the result of free choice; for
there is neither enmity nor sin without the enemy and the sinner. And
the command “to covet nothing,” not as if the things to be desired did
not belong to us, does not teach us not to entertain desire, as those
suppose who teach that the Creator is different from the first God, not
as if creation was loathsome and bad (for such opinions are impious).
But we say that the things of the world are *not our own*, not as if
they were monstrous, not as if they did not belong to God, the Lord of
the universe, but because we do not continue among them for ever; being,
in respect of possession, not ours, and passing from one to another in
succession; but belonging to us, for whom they were made in respect of
use, so long as it is necessary to continue with them. In accordance,
therefore, with natural appetite, things disallowed are to be used
rightly, avoiding all excess and inordinate affection.
