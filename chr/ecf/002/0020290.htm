<p> <a name="vi.iii.iii.xii"></A> <h5 align="center"><a name="vi.iii.iii.xii-p0.1"></A>Chapter XII.&#8212;Continuation: with Texts from Scripture.</h5>  
<p><a name="vi.iii.iii.xii-p1"></A>I would counsel the married never to kiss their wives in the presence of their domestics. For Aristotle does not allow people to laugh to their slaves. And by no means must a wife be seen saluted in their presence. It is moreover better that, beginning at home with marriage, we should exhibit propriety in it. For it is the greatest bond of chastity, breathing forth pure pleasure. Very admirably the tragedy says:&#8212;</p>  <blockquote><a name="vi.iii.iii.xii-p1.1"></A> &#8220;Well! well! ladies, how is it, then, that among men,<br>  Not gold, not empire, or luxury of wealth,<br>  Conferred to such an extent signal delights,<br>  As the right and virtuous disposition<br>  Of a man of worth and a dutiful wife?&#8221; <br>  </blockquote>  
<p class="skip"><a name="vi.iii.iii.xii-p2"></A>Such injunctions of righteousness uttered by those who are conversant with worldly wisdom are not to be refused. Knowing, then, the duty of each, &#8220;pass the time of your sojourning here in fear: forasmuch as ye know that ye were not deemed with corruptible things, such as silver or gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers; but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1736"></A><A HREF="#fn_1736"><FONT SIZE="1">1737</FONT></A>
 &#8220;For,&#8221; says Peter, &#8220;the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revellings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1737"></A><A HREF="#fn_1737"><FONT SIZE="1">1738</FONT></A>
 We have as a limit the cross of the Lord, by which we are fenced and hedged about from our former sins. Therefore, being regenerated, let us fix ourselves to it in truth, and return to sobriety, and sanctify ourselves; &#8220;for the eyes of the <span class="sc"><a name="vi.iii.iii.xii-p4.2"></A>Lord</span> are on the righteous, and His ears are open to their prayer; but the face of the <span class="sc"><a name="vi.iii.iii.xii-p4.3"></A>Lord</span> is against them that do evil.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1738"></A><A HREF="#fn_1738"><FONT SIZE="1">1739</FONT></A>
 And who is he that will harm us, if we  <A NAME="page_292"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 292</FONT></A> <a name="vi.iii.iii.xii-Page_292"></A>be followers of that which is good?&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1739"></A><A HREF="#fn_1739"><FONT SIZE="1">1740</FONT></A>
&#8212;&#8220;us&#8221; for &#8220;you.&#8221; But the best training is good order, which is perfect decorum, and stable and orderly power, which in action maintains consistence in what it does. If these things have been adduced by me with too great asperity, in order to effect the salvation which follows from your correction; they have been spoken also, says the Instructor, by me: &#8220;Since he who reproves with boldness is a peacemaker.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1740"></A><A HREF="#fn_1740"><FONT SIZE="1">1741</FONT></A>
 And if ye hear me, ye shall be saved. And if ye attend not to what is spoken, it is not my concern. And yet it is my concern thus: &#8220;For he desires the repentance rather than the death of a sinner.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1741"></A><A HREF="#fn_1741"><FONT SIZE="1">1742</FONT></A>
 &#8220;If ye shall hear me, ye shall eat the good of the land,&#8221; the Instructor again says, calling by the appellation &#8220;the good of the land,&#8221; beauty, wealth, health, strength, sustenance. For those things which are really good, are what &#8220;neither ear hath heard, not hath ever entered into the heart&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1742"></A><A HREF="#fn_1742"><FONT SIZE="1">1743</FONT></A>
 respecting Him who is really King, and the realities truly good which await us. For He is the giver and the guard of good things. And with respect to their participation, He applies the same names of things in this world, the Word thus training in God the feebleness of men from sensible things to understanding.</p>  
<p><a name="vi.iii.iii.xii-p10"></A>What has to be observed at home, and how our life is to be regulated, the Instructor has abundantly declared. And the things which He is wont to say to children by the way,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1743"></A><A HREF="#fn_1743"><FONT SIZE="1">1744</FONT></A>
 while He conducts them to the Master, these He suggests, and adduces the Scriptures themselves in a compendious form, setting forth bare injunctions, accommodating them to the period of guidance, and assigning the interpretation of them to the Master.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1744"></A><A HREF="#fn_1744"><FONT SIZE="1">1745</FONT></A>
 For the intention of His law is to dissipate fear, emancipating free-will in order to faith. &#8220;Hear,&#8221; He says, &#8220;O child,&#8221; who art rightly instructed, the principal points of salvation. For I will disclose my ways, and lay before thee good commandments; by which thou wilt reach salvation. And I lead thee by the way of salvation. Depart from the paths of deceit.</p>  
<p><a name="vi.iii.iii.xii-p13"></A>&#8220;For the <span class="sc"><a name="vi.iii.iii.xii-p13.1"></A>Lord</span> knoweth the way of the righteous, and the way of the ungodly shall perish.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1745"></A><A HREF="#fn_1745"><FONT SIZE="1">1746</FONT></A>
 &#8220;Follow, therefore, O son, the good way which I shall describe, lending to me attentive ears.&#8221; &#8220;And I will give to thee the treasures of darkness, hidden and unseen&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1746"></A><A HREF="#fn_1746"><FONT SIZE="1">1747</FONT></A>
 by the nations, but seen by us. And the treasures of wisdom are unfailing, in admiration of which the apostle says, &#8220;O the depth of the riches and the wisdom!&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1747"></A><A HREF="#fn_1747"><FONT SIZE="1">1748</FONT></A>
 And by one God are many treasures dispensed; some disclosed by the law, others by the prophets; some to the divine mouth, and others to the heptad of the spirit singing accordant. And the Lord being one, is the same Instructor by all these. Here is then a comprehensive precept, and an exhortation of life, all-embracing: &#8220;As ye would that men should do unto you, do ye likewise to, them.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1748"></A><A HREF="#fn_1748"><FONT SIZE="1">1749</FONT></A>
 We may comprehend the commandments in two, as the Lord says, &#8220;Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy soul, and with all thy strength; and thy neighbour as thyself.&#8221; Then from these He infers, &#8220;on this hang the law and the prophets.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1749"></A><A HREF="#fn_1749"><FONT SIZE="1">1750</FONT></A>
 Further, to him that asked, &#8220;What good thing shall I do, that I may inherit eternal life?&#8221; He answered, &#8220;Thou knowest the commandments?&#8221; And on him replying Yea, He said, &#8220;This do, and thou shalt be saved.&#8221; Especially conspicuous is the love of the Instructor set forth in various salutary commandments, in order that the discovery may be readier, from the abundance and arrangement of the Scriptures. We have the Decalogue&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1750"></A><A HREF="#fn_1750"><FONT SIZE="1">1751</FONT></A>
 given by Moses, which, indicating by an elementary principle, simple and of one kind, defines the designation of sins in a way conducive to salvation: &#8220;Thou shall not commit adultery. Thou shall not worship idols. Thou shalt not corrupt boys. Thou shalt not steal. Thou shall not bear false witness.  Honour thy father and thy mother.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1751"></A><A HREF="#fn_1751"><FONT SIZE="1">1752</FONT></A>
 And so forth. These things are to be observed, and whatever else is commanded in reading the Bible. And He enjoins on us by Isaiah: &#8220;Wash you, and make you clean. Put away iniquities from your souls before mine eyes. Learn to do well. Seek judgment. Deliver the wronged. Judge for the orphan, and justify the widow. And come, and let us reason together, saith the Lord.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1752"></A><A HREF="#fn_1752"><FONT SIZE="1">1753</FONT></A>
 And we shall find many examples also in other places,&#8212;as, for instance, respecting prayer: &#8220;Good works are an acceptable prayer to the Lord,&#8221; says the Scripture.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1753"></A><A HREF="#fn_1753"><FONT SIZE="1">1754</FONT></A>
 And the manner of prayer is described.  &#8220;If thou seest,&#8221; it is said, &#8220;the naked, cover him; and thou shalt not overlook those who belong to thy seed. Then shall thy light spring forth early, and thy healing shall spring up quickly; and thy righteousness shall go before thee, and the glory of God shall encompass thee.&#8221; What, then, is the fruit of such prayer?  &#8220;Then shall thou call, and God will hear thee; whilst thou art yet speaking, He will say, I am here.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1754"></A><A HREF="#fn_1754"><FONT SIZE="1">1755</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p><a name="vi.iii.iii.xii-p24"></A>In regard to fasting it is said, &#8220;Wherefore do  <A NAME="page_293"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 293</FONT></A> <a name="vi.iii.iii.xii-Page_293"></A>ye fast to me? saith the Lord. Is it such a fast that I have chosen, even a day for a man to humble his soul? Thou shall not bend thy neck like a circle, and spread sackcloth and ashes under thee. Not thus shall ye call it an acceptable fast.&#8221;</p>  
<p><a name="vi.iii.iii.xii-p25"></A>What means a fast, then? &#8220;Lo, this is the fast which I have chosen, saith the Lord. Loose every band of wickedness.  Dissolve the knots of oppressive contracts. Let the oppressed go free, and tear every unjust bond. Break thy bread to the hungry; and lead the houseless poor into thy house. If thou see the naked cover him.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1755"></A><A HREF="#fn_1755"><FONT SIZE="1">1756</FONT></A>
 About sacrifices too: &#8220;To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices to me? saith the Lord. I am full of burnt-offerings and of rams; and the fat of lambs, and the blood of bulls and kids I do not wish; nor that ye should come to appear before me. Who hath required this at your hands? You shall no more tread my court. If ye bring fine flour, the vain oblation is an abomination to me. Your new moons and your sabbaths I cannot away with.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1756"></A><A HREF="#fn_1756"><FONT SIZE="1">1757</FONT></A>
 How, then, shall I sacrifice to the Lord?  &#8220;The sacrifice of the Lord is,&#8221; He says, &#8220;a broken heart.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1757"></A><A HREF="#fn_1757"><FONT SIZE="1">1758</FONT></A>
 How, then, shall I crown myself, or anoint with ointment, or offer incense to the Lord? &#8220;An odour of a sweet fragrance,&#8221; it is said,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1758"></A><A HREF="#fn_1758"><FONT SIZE="1">1759</FONT></A>
 &#8220;is the heart that glorifies Him who made it.&#8221; These are the crowns and sacrifices, aromatic odours, and flowers of God.</p>  
<p><a name="vi.iii.iii.xii-p30"></A>Further, in respect to forbearance. &#8220;If thy brother,&#8221; it is said, &#8220;sin against thee, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him. If he sin against thee seven times in a day, and turn to thee the seventh time, and say, I repent, forgive him.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1759"></A><A HREF="#fn_1759"><FONT SIZE="1">1760</FONT></A>
 Also to the soldiers, by John, He commands, &#8220;to be content with their wages only;&#8221; and to the publicans, &#8220;to exact no more than is appointed.&#8221; To the judges He says, &#8220;Thou shalt not show partiality in judgment. For gifts blind the eyes of those who see, and corrupt just words. Rescue the wronged.&#8221;</p>  
<p><a name="vi.iii.iii.xii-p32"></A>And to householders: &#8220;A possession which is acquired with iniquity becomes less.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1760"></A><A HREF="#fn_1760"><FONT SIZE="1">1761</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p><a name="vi.iii.iii.xii-p34"></A>Also of &#8220;love.&#8221; &#8220;Love,&#8221; He says, &#8220;covers a multitude of sins.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1761"></A><A HREF="#fn_1761"><FONT SIZE="1">1762</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p><a name="vi.iii.iii.xii-p36"></A>And of civil government: &#8220;Render to C&aelig;sar the things which are C&aelig;sar&#146;s; and unto God the things which are God&#146;s.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1762"></A><A HREF="#fn_1762"><FONT SIZE="1">1763</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p><a name="vi.iii.iii.xii-p38"></A>Of swearing and the remembrance of injuries: &#8220;Did I command your fathers, when they went out of Egypt, to offer burnt-offerings and sacrifices? But I commanded them, Let none of you bear malice in his heart against his neighbour, or love a false oath.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1763"></A><A HREF="#fn_1763"><FONT SIZE="1">1764</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p><a name="vi.iii.iii.xii-p40"></A>The liars and the proud, too, He threatens; the former thus: &#8220;Woe to them that call bitter sweet, and sweet bitter;&#8221; and the latter: &#8220;Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1764"></A><A HREF="#fn_1764"><FONT SIZE="1">1765</FONT></A>
 &#8220;For he that humbleth himself shall be exalted, and he that exalteth himself shall be humbled.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1765"></A><A HREF="#fn_1765"><FONT SIZE="1">1766</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p><a name="vi.iii.iii.xii-p43"></A>And &#8220;the merciful&#8221; He blesses, &#8220;for they shall obtain mercy.&#8221;</p>  
<p><a name="vi.iii.iii.xii-p44"></A>Wisdom pronounces anger a wretched thing, because &#8220;it will destroy the wise.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1766"></A><A HREF="#fn_1766"><FONT SIZE="1">1767</FONT></A>
 And now He bids us &#8220;love our enemies, bless them that curse us, and pray for them that despitefully use us.&#8221; And He says: &#8220;If any one strike thee on the one cheek, turn to him the other also; and if any one take away thy coat, hinder him not from taking thy cloak also.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1767"></A><A HREF="#fn_1767"><FONT SIZE="1">1768</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p><a name="vi.iii.iii.xii-p47"></A>Of faith He says: &#8220;Whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1768"></A><A HREF="#fn_1768"><FONT SIZE="1">1769</FONT></A>
 &#8220;To the unbelieving nothing is trustworthy,&#8221; according to Pindar.</p>  
<p><a name="vi.iii.iii.xii-p49"></A>Domestics, too, are to be treated like ourselves; for they are human beings, as we are. For God is the same to free and bond, if you consider.</p>  
<p><a name="vi.iii.iii.xii-p50"></A>Such of our brethren as transgress, we must not punish, but rebuke. &#8220;For he that spareth the rod hateth his son.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1769"></A><A HREF="#fn_1769"><FONT SIZE="1">1770</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p><a name="vi.iii.iii.xii-p52"></A>Further, He banishes utterly love of glory, saying, &#8220;Woe to you, Pharisees! for ye love the chief seat in the synagogues, and greetings in the markets.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1770"></A><A HREF="#fn_1770"><FONT SIZE="1">1771</FONT></A>
 But He welcomes the repentance of the sinner&#8212;loving repentance&#8212;which follows sins. For this Word of whom we speak alone is sinless. For to sin is natural and common to all. But to return [to God] after sinning is characteristic not of any man, but only of a man of worth.</p>  
<p><a name="vi.iii.iii.xii-p54"></A>Respecting liberality He said: &#8220;Come to me, ye blessed, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: for I was an hungry, and ye gave Me meat; I was thirsty, and ye gave Me drink; I was a stranger, and ye took Me in; naked, and ye clothed Me; sick, and ye visited Me; in prison, and ye came unto Me.&#8221; And when have we done any of these things to the Lord?</p>  
<p><a name="vi.iii.iii.xii-p55"></A>The Instructor Himself will say again, loving to refer to Himself the kindness of the brethren, &#8220;Inasmuch as ye have done it to these least, ye have done it to Me. And these shall go away into everlasting life.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1771"></A><A HREF="#fn_1771"><FONT SIZE="1">1772</FONT></A>
</p>  <A NAME="page_294"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 294</FONT></A> <a name="vi.iii.iii.xii-Page_294"></A>  
<p><a name="vi.iii.iii.xii-p57"></A>Such are the laws of the Word, the consolatory words not on tables of stone which were written by the finger of the Lord, but inscribed on men&#146;s hearts, on which alone they can remain imperishable. Wherefore the tablets of those who had hearts of stone are broken, that the faith of the children may be impressed on softened hearts.</p>  
<p><a name="vi.iii.iii.xii-p58"></A>However, both the laws served the Word for the instruction of humanity, both that given by Moses and that by the apostles. What, therefore, is the nature of the training by the apostles, appears to me to require to be treated of. Under this head, I, or rather the Instructor by me,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1772"></A><A HREF="#fn_1772"><FONT SIZE="1">1773</FONT></A>
 will recount; and I shall again set before you the precepts themselves, as it were in the germ.</p>  
<p><a name="vi.iii.iii.xii-p60"></A>&#8220;Putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbour: for we are members one of another. Let not the sun go down upon your wrath; neither give place to the devil. Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour, working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth.  Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil-speaking, be put away from you, with all malice: and be ye kind one to another, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ hath forgiven you. Be therefore wise,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1773"></A><A HREF="#fn_1773"><FONT SIZE="1">1774</FONT></A>
 followers of God, as dear children; and walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us. Let wives be subject to their own husbands, as to the Lord. And let husbands love their wives as Christ also hath loved the Church.&#8221; Let those who are yoked together love one another &#8220;as their own bodies.&#8221; &#8220;Children, be obedient to your parents. Parents, provoke not your children to wrath; but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. Servants, be obedient to those that are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in the singleness of your hearts, as unto Christ; with good-will from the soul doing service. ye masters, treat your servants well, forbearing threatening: knowing that both their and your Lord is in heaven; and there is no respect of persons with Him.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1774"></A><A HREF="#fn_1774"><FONT SIZE="1">1775</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p><a name="vi.iii.iii.xii-p63"></A>&#8220;If we live in the Spirit, let us walk in the Spirit. Let us not be desirous of vainglory, provoking one another, envying one another. Bear ye one another&#146;s burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ. Be not deceived; God is not mocked. Let us not be weary in well-doing: for in due time we shall reap, if we faint not.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1775"></A><A HREF="#fn_1775"><FONT SIZE="1">1776</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p><a name="vi.iii.iii.xii-p65"></A>&#8220;Be at peace among yourselves. Now we admonish you, brethren, warn them who are unruly, comfort the feeble-minded, support the weak, be patient toward all men. See that none render evil for evil to any man. Quench not the Spirit. Despise not prophesyings. Prove all things: hold fast that which is good. Abstain from every form of evil.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1776"></A><A HREF="#fn_1776"><FONT SIZE="1">1777</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p><a name="vi.iii.iii.xii-p67"></A>&#8220;Continue in prayer, watching thereunto with thanksgiving. Walk in wisdom towards them that are without, redeeming the time. Let your speech be always with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1777"></A><A HREF="#fn_1777"><FONT SIZE="1">1778</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p><a name="vi.iii.iii.xii-p69"></A>&#8220;Nourish yourselves up in the words of faith.  Exercise yourselves unto godliness: for bodily exercise profiteth little; but godliness is profitable for all things, having the promise of the life which now is, and that which is to come.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1778"></A><A HREF="#fn_1778"><FONT SIZE="1">1779</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p><a name="vi.iii.iii.xii-p71"></A>&#8220;Let those who have faithful masters not despise them, because they are brethren; but rather do them service, because they are faithful.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1779"></A><A HREF="#fn_1779"><FONT SIZE="1">1780</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p><a name="vi.iii.iii.xii-p73"></A>&#8220;He that giveth, let him do it with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that showeth mercy, with cheerfulness. Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good. Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love, in honour preferring one another. Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit, serving the Lord. Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer. Given to hospitality; communicating to the necessities of the saints.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1780"></A><A HREF="#fn_1780"><FONT SIZE="1">1781</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p><a name="vi.iii.iii.xii-p75"></A>Such are a few injunctions out of many, for the sake of example, which the Instructor, running over the divine Scriptures, sets before His children; by which, so to speak, vice is cut up by the roots, and iniquity is circumscribed.</p>  
<p><a name="vi.iii.iii.xii-p76"></A>Innumerable commands such as these are written in the holy Bible appertaining to chosen persons, some to presbyters, some to bishops, some to deacons, others to widows,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1781"></A><A HREF="#fn_1781"><FONT SIZE="1">1782</FONT></A>
 of whom we shall have another opportunity of speaking. Many things spoken in enigmas, many in parables, may benefit such as fall in with them. But it is not my province, says the Instructor, to teach these any longer. But we need a Teacher of the exposition of those sacred words, to whom we must direct our steps.</p>  
<p><a name="vi.iii.iii.xii-p78"></A>And now, in truth, it is time for me to cease from my instruction, and for you to listen to the Teacher.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1782"></A><A HREF="#fn_1782"><FONT SIZE="1">1783</FONT></A>
 And He, receiving you who have been trained up in excellent discipline, will teach you the oracles. To noble purpose has  <A NAME="page_295"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 295</FONT></A> <a name="vi.iii.iii.xii-Page_295"></A>the Church sung, and the Bridegroom also, the only Teacher, the good Counsel, of the good Father, the true Wisdom, the Sanctuary of knowledge. &#8220;And He is the propitiation for our sins,&#8221; as John says; Jesus, who heals both our body and soul&#8212;which are the proper man. &#8220;And not for our sins only, but also for the whole world. And by this we know that we know Him, if we keep His commandments. He that saith, I know Him, and keepeth not His commandments, is a liar; and the truth is not in Him. But whoso keepeth His word, in him verily is the love of God perfected. Hereby know we that we are in Him. He that saith he abideth in Him, ought himself to walk even as He also walked.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1783"></A><A HREF="#fn_1783"><FONT SIZE="1">1784</FONT></A>
 O nurslings of His blessed training! let us complete the fair face of the church; and let us run as children to our good mother. And if we become listeners to the Word, let us glorify the blessed dispensation by which man is trained and sanctified as a child of God, and has his conversation in heaven, being trained from earth, and there receives the Father, whom he learns to know on earth. The Word both does and teaches all things, and trains in all things.</p>  
<p><a name="vi.iii.iii.xii-p81"></A>A horse is guided by a bit, and a bull is guided by a yoke, and a wild beast is caught in a noose. But man is transformed by the Word, by whom wild beasts are tamed, and fishes caught, and birds drawn down. He it is, in truth, who fashions the bit for the horse, the yoke for the bull, the noose for the wild beast, the rod for the fish, the snare for the bird. He both manages the state and tills the ground; commands, and helps, and creates the universe.</p>  <blockquote><a name="vi.iii.iii.xii-p81.1"></A> &#8220;There were figured earth, and sky, and sea,<br>  The ever-circling sun, and full-orbed moon,<br>  And all the signs that crown the vault of heaven.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1784"></A><A HREF="#fn_1784"><FONT SIZE="1">1785</FONT></A>
