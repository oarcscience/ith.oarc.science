##### <span id="vi.iv.vii.xiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIII.—Description of the Gnostic Continued.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xiii-p1"></span>He never remembers those who have
sinned against him, but forgives them. Wherefore also he righteously
prays, saying, “Forgive us; for we also forgive.” <span
id="fr_3636"></span>[3637](#fn_3636.md) For this also is one of the things
which God wishes, to covet nothing, to hate no one. For all men are the
work of one will. And is it not the Saviour, who wishes the Gnostic to
be perfect as “the heavenly Father,” <span
id="fr_3637"></span>[3638](#fn_3637.md) that is, Himself, who says, “Come,
ye children, hear from me the fear of the <span class="sc"><span
id="vi.iv.vii.xiii-p3.2"></span>Lord</span>?” <span
id="fr_3638"></span>[3639](#fn_3638.md) He wishes him no longer to stand in
need of help by angels, but to receive it from Himself, having become
worthy, and to have protection from Himself by obedience.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xiii-p5"></span>Such an one demands from the Lord,
and does not merely ask. And in the case of his brethren in want, the
Gnostic will not ask himself for abundance of wealth to bestow, but will
pray that the supply of what they need may be furnished to them. For so
the Gnostic gives his prayer to those who are in need, and by his <span
id="page_547">p. 547</span> <span
id="vi.iv.vii.xiii-Page_547"></span>prayer they are supplied, without
his knowledge, and without vanity.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xiii-p6"></span>Penury and disease, and such trials,
are often sent for admonition, for the correction of the past, and for
care for the future. Such an one prays for relief from them, in virtue
of possessing the prerogative of knowledge, not out of vainglory; but
from the very fact of his being a Gnostic, he works beneficence, having
become the instrument of the goodness of God.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xiii-p7"></span>They say in the traditions <span
id="fr_3639"></span>[3640](#fn_3639.md) that Matthew the apostle constantly
said, that “if the neighbour of an elect man sin, the elect man has
sinned. For had he conducted himself as the Word prescribes, his
neighbour also would have been filled with such reverence for the life
he led as not to sin.”

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xiii-p9"></span>What, then, shall we say of the
Gnostic himself? “Know ye not,” says the apostle, “that ye are the
temple of God?” <span id="fr_3640"></span>[3641](#fn_3640.md) The Gnostic
is consequently divine, and already holy, God-bearing, and God-borne.
Now the Scripture, showing that sinning is foreign to him, sells those
who have fallen away to strangers, saying, “Look not on a strange woman,
to lust,” <span id="fr_3641"></span>[3642](#fn_3641.md) plainly pronounces
sin foreign and contrary to the nature of the temple of God. Now the
temple is great, as the Church, and it is small, as the man who
preserves the seed of Abraham. He, therefore, who has God resting in him
will not desire aught else. At once leaving all hindrances, and
despising all matter which distracts him, he cleaves the heaven by
knowledge. And passing through the spiritual Essences, and all rule and
authority, he touches the highest thrones, hasting to that alone for the
sake of which alone he knew.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xiii-p12"></span>Mixing, then, “the serpent with the
dove,” <span id="fr_3642"></span>[3643](#fn_3642.md) he lives at once
perfectly and with a good conscience, mingling faith with hope, in order
to the expectation of the future. For he is conscious of the boon he has
received, having become worthy of obtaining it; and is translated from
slavery to adoption, as the consequence of knowledge; knowing God, or
rather known of Him, for the end, he puts forth energies corresponding
to the worth of grace. For works follow knowledge, as the shadow the
body.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xiii-p14"></span>Rightly, then, he is not disturbed
by anything which happens; nor does he suspect those things, which,
through divine arrangement, take place for good. Nor is he ashamed to
die, having a good conscience, and being fit to be seen by the Powers.
Cleansed, so to speak, from all the stains of the soul, he knows right
well that it will be better with him after his departure.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xiii-p15"></span>Whence he never prefers pleasure
and profit to the divine arrangement, since he trains himself by the
commands, that in all things he may be well pleasing to the Lord, and
praiseworthy in the sight of the world, since all things depend on the
one Sovereign God. The Son of God, it is said, came to His own, and His
own received Him not. Wherefore also in the use of the things of the
world he not only gives thanks and praises the creation, but also, while
using them as is right, is praised; since the end he has in view
terminates in contemplation by gnostic activity in accordance with the
commandments.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xiii-p16"></span>Thence now, by knowledge collecting
materials to be the food of contemplation, having embraced nobly the
magnitude of knowledge, he advances to the holy recompense of
translation hence. For he has heard the Psalm which says: “Encircle
Zion, and encompass it, tell upon its towers.” <span
id="fr_3643"></span>[3644](#fn_3643.md) For it intimates, I think, those
who have sublimely embraced the Word, so as to become lofty towers, and
to stand firmly in faith and knowledge.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xiii-p18"></span>Let these statements concerning the
Gnostic, containing the germs of the matter in as brief terms as
possible, be made to the Greeks. But let it be known that if the
\[mere\] believer do rightly one or a second of these things, yet he
will not do so in all nor with the highest knowledge, like the Gnostic.
