##### <span id="ii.ii.v-p0.2"></span>Concerning the Commandments. <span id="fr_148"></span>[149](#fn_148)

<span id="ii.ii.v-p2"></span>After I had been praying at home, and had
sat down on my couch, there entered a man of <span id="page_19">p.
19</span> <span id="ii.ii.v-Page_19"></span>glorious aspect, dressed
like a shepherd, with a white goat’s skin, a wallet on his shoulders,
and a rod in his hand, and saluted me. I returned his salutation. And
straightway he sat down beside me, and said to me, “I have been sent by
a most venerable angel to dwell with you the remaining days of your
life.” And I thought that he had come to tempt me, and I said to him,
“Who are you? For I know him to whom I have been entrusted.” He said to
me, “Do you not know me?” “No,” said I. “I,” said he, “am that shepherd
to whom you have been entrusted.” And while he yet spake, his figure was
changed; and then I knew that it was he to whom I had been entrusted.
And straightway I became confused, and fear took hold of me, and I was
overpowered with deep sorrow that I had answered him so wickedly and
foolishly. But he answered, and said to me, “Do not be confounded, but
receive strength from the commandments which I am going to give you. For
I have been sent,” said he, “to show you again all the things which you
saw before, especially those of them which are useful to you. First of
all, then, write down my commandments and similitudes, and you will
write the other things as I shall show you. For this purpose,” said he,
“I command you to write down the commandments and similitudes first,
that you may read them easily, and be able to keep them.” <span
id="fr_149"></span>[150](#fn_149) Accordingly I wrote down the
commandments and similitudes, exactly as he had ordered me. If then,
when you have heard these, ye keep them and walk in them, and practice
them with pure minds, you will receive from the Lord all that He has
promised to you. But if, after you have heard them, ye do not repent,
but continue to add to your sins, then shall ye receive from the Lord
the opposite things. All these words did the shepherd, even the angel of
repentance, command me to write. <span id="fr_150"></span>[151](#fn_150)

<span id="ii.ii.v-p4"></span> \[“The Shepherd,” then, is the “angel of
repentance,” here represented as a guardian angel. This gives the work
its character, as enforcing primarily the anti-Montanist principle of
the value of true repentance in the sight of God.\]
