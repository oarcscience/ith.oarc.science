##### <span id="iv.ii.i.i-p0.1"></span>Chapter I.—Autolycus an Idolater and Scorner of Christians.

<span id="iv.ii.i.i-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.ii.i.i-p1.1"></span>A fluent</span> tongue and an elegant style
afford pleasure and such praise as vainglory delights in, to wretched
men who have been corrupted in mind; the lover of truth does not give
heed to ornamented speeches, but examines the real matter of the speech,
what it is, and what kind it is. Since, then, my friend, you have
assailed me with empty words, boasting of your gods of wood and stone,
hammered and cast, carved and graven, which neither see nor hear, for
they are idols, and the works of men’s hands; and since, besides, you
call me a Christian, as if this were a damning name to bear, I, for my
part, avow that I am a Christian, <span
id="fr_524"></span>[525](#fn_524.md) and bear this name beloved of God,
hoping to be serviceable <span id="fr_525"></span>[526](#fn_525.md) to God.
For it is not the case, as you suppose, that the name of God is hard to
bear; but possibly you entertain this opinion of God, because you are
yourself yet unserviceable to Him.
