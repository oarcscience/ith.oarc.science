##### <span id="vi.iv.ii.xii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XII.—Twofold Faith.

<span id="vi.iv.ii.xii-p1"></span>Faith as also Time being double, we
shall find virtues in pairs both dwelling together. For memory is
related to past time, hope to future. We believe that what is past did,
and that what is future will take place. And, on the other hand, we
love, persuaded by faith that the past was as it was, and by hope
expecting the future. For in everything love attends the Gnostic, who
knows one God. “And, behold, all things which He created were very
good.” <span id="fr_2273"></span>[2274](#fn_2273.md) He both knows and
admires. Godliness adds length of <span id="page_360">p. 360</span>
<span id="vi.iv.ii.xii-Page_360"></span>life; and the fear of the Lord
adds days. As, then, the days are a portion of life in its progress, so
also fear is the beginning of love, becoming by development faith, then
love. But it is not as I fear and hate a wild beast (since fear is
twofold) that I fear the father, whom I fear and love at once. Again,
fearing lest I be punished, I love myself in assuming fear. He who fears
to offend his father, loves himself. Blessed then is he who is found
possessed of faith, being, as he is, composed of love and fear. And
faith is power in order to salvation, and strength to eternal life.
Again, prophecy is foreknowledge; and knowledge the understanding of
prophecy; being the knowledge of those things known before by the Lord
who reveals all things.

<span id="vi.iv.ii.xii-p3"></span>The knowledge, then, of those things
which have been predicted shows a threefold result—either one that has
happened long ago, or exists now, or about to be. Then the
extremes <span id="fr_2274"></span>[2275](#fn_2274.md) either of what is
accomplished or of what is hoped for fall under faith; and the present
action furnishes persuasive arguments of the confirmation of both the
extremes. For if, prophecy being one, one part is accomplishing and
another is fulfilled; hence the truth, both what is hoped for and what
is passed is confirmed. For it was first present; then it became past to
us; so that the belief of what is past is the apprehension of a past
event, and a hope which is future the apprehension of a future event.

<span id="vi.iv.ii.xii-p5"></span>And not only the Platonists, but the
Stoics, say that assent is in our own power. All opinion then, and
judgment, and supposition, and knowledge, by which we live and have
perpetual intercourse with the human race, is an assent; which is
nothing else than faith. And unbelief being defection from faith, shows
both assent and faith to be possessed of power; for non-existence cannot
be called privation. And if you consider the truth, you will find man
naturally misled so as to give assent to what is false, though
possessing the resources necessary for belief in the truth. “The virtue,
then, that encloses the Church in its grasp,” as the Shepherd
says, <span id="fr_2275"></span>[2276](#fn_2275.md) “is Faith, by which the
elect of God are saved; and that which acts the man is Self-restraint.
And these are followed by Simplicity, Knowledge, Innocence, Decorum,
Love,” and all these are the daughters of Faith. And again, “Faith leads
the way, fear upbuilds, and love perfects.” Accordingly he <span
id="fr_2276"></span>[2277](#fn_2276.md) says, the Lord is to be feared in
order to edification, but not the devil to destruction. And again, the
works of the Lord—that is, His commandments—are to be loved and done;
but the works of the devil are to be dreaded and not done. For the fear
of God trains and restores to love; but the fear of the works of the
devil has hatred dwelling along with it. The same also says “that
repentance is high intelligence. For he that repents of what he did, no
longer does or says as he did. But by torturing himself for his sins, he
benefits his soul. Forgiveness of sins is therefore different from
repentance; but both show what is in our power.”
