##### <span id="vi.iv.i.xxii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXII.—On the Greek Translation of the Old Testament.

<span id="vi.iv.i.xxii-p1"></span>So much for the details respecting
dates, as stated variously by many, and as set down by us.

<span id="vi.iv.i.xxii-p2"></span>It is said that the Scriptures both of
the law and of the prophets were translated from the dialect of the
Hebrews into the Greek language in the reign of Ptolemy the son of
Lagos, or, according to others, of Ptolemy surnamed Philadelphus;
Demetrius Phalereus bringing to this task the greatest earnestness, and
employing painstaking accuracy on the materials for the translation. For
the Macedonians being still in possession of Asia, and the king being
ambitious of adorning the library he had at Alexandria with all
writings, desired the people of Jerusalem to translate the prophecies
they possessed into the Greek dialect. And they being the subjects of
the Macedonians, selected from those of highest character among them
seventy elders, versed in the Scriptures, and skilled in the Greek
dialect, and sent them to him with the divine books. And each having
severally translated each prophetic book, and all the translations being
compared together, they agreed both in meaning and expression. For it
was the counsel of God carried out for the benefit of Grecian ears. It
was not alien to the inspiration of God, who gave the prophecy, also to
produce the translation, and make it as it were Greek prophecy. Since
the Scriptures having perished in the captivity of Nabuchodonosor,
Esdras <span id="fr_2095"></span>[2096](#fn_2095.md) the Levite, the
priest, in the time of Artaxerxes king of the Persians, having become
inspired in the exercise of prophecy restored again the whole of the
ancient Scriptures. And Aristobulus, in his first book addressed to
Philometor, writes in these words: “And Plato followed the laws given to
us, and had manifestly studied all that is said in them.” And before
Demetrius there had been translated by another, previous to the dominion
of Alexander and of the Persians, the account of the departure of our
countrymen the Hebrews from Egypt, and the fame of all that happened to
them, and their taking possession of the land, and the account of the
whole code of laws; so that it is perfectly clear that the
above-mentioned philosopher derived a great deal from this source, for
he was very learned, as also Pythagoras, who transferred many things
from our books to his own system of doctrines. And Numenius, the
Pythagorean philosopher, expressly writes: “For what is Plato, but Moses
speaking <span id="page_335">p. 335</span> <span
id="vi.iv.i.xxii-Page_335"></span>in Attic Greek?” This Moses was a
theologian and prophet, and as some say, an interpreter of sacred laws.
His family, his deeds, and life, are related by the Scriptures
themselves, which are worthy of all credit; but have nevertheless to be
stated by us also as well as we can. <span
