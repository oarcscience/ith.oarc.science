##### <span id="v.iii.xviii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.—Judgment Must Have Reference Both to Soul and Body: There Will Therefore Be a Resurrection.

<span id="v.iii.xviii-p1"></span>The arguments I just now proposed for
examination, as establishing the truth of the resurrection, are all of
the same kind, since they all start from the same point; for their
starting-point is the origin of the first men by creation. But while
some of them derive their strength from the starting-point itself from
which they take their rise, others, consequent upon the nature and the
life of men, acquire their credibility from the superintendence of God
over us; for the cause according to which, and on account of which, men
have come into being, being closely connected with the nature of men,
derives its force from creation; but the argument from rectitude, which
represents God as judging men according as they have lived well or ill,
derives its force from the end of their existence: they come into being
on the former ground, but their state depends more on God’s
superintendence. And now that the matters which come first have been
demonstrated by me to the best of my ability, it will be well to prove
our proposition by those also which come after—I mean by the reward or
punishment due to each man in accordance with righteous judgment, and by
the final cause of human existence; and of these I put foremost that
which takes the lead by nature, and inquire first into the argument
relating to the judgment: premising only one thing, from concern for the
principle which appertains to the matters before us, and for
order—namely, that it is incumbent on those who admit God to be the
Maker of this universe, <span id="page_159">p. 159</span> <span
id="v.iii.xviii-Page_159"></span>to ascribe to His wisdom and rectitude
the preservation and care of all that has been created, if they wish to
keep to their own principles; and with such views to hold that nothing
either in earth or in heaven is without guardianship or providence, but
that, on the contrary, to everything, invisible and visible alike, small
and great, the attention of the Creator reaches; for all created things
require the attention of the Creator, <span
id="fr_844"></span>[845](#fn_844.md) and each one in particular, according
to its nature and the end for which it was made: though I think it would
be a useless expenditure of trouble to go through the list now, or
distinguish between the several cases, or mention in detail what is
suitable to each nature. Man, at all events, of whom it is now our
business to speak, as being in want, requires food; as being mortal,
posterity; as being rational, a process of judgment. But if each of
these things belongs to man by nature, and he requires food for his
life, and requires posterity for the continuance of the race, and
requires a judgment in order that food and posterity may be according to
law, it of course follows, since food and posterity refer to both
together, that the judgment must be referred to them too (by both
together I mean man, consisting of soul and body), and that such man
becomes accountable for all his actions, and receives for them either
reward or punishment. Now, if the righteous judgment awards to both
together its retribution for the deeds wrought; and if it is not proper
that either the soul alone should receive the wages of the deeds wrought
in union with the body (for this of itself has no inclination to the
faults which are committed in connection with the pleasure or food and
culture of the body), or that the body alone should (for this of itself
is incapable of distinguishing law and justice), but man, composed of
these, is subjected to trial for each of the deeds wrought by him; and
if reason does not find this happening either in this life (for the
award according to merit finds no place in the present existence, since
many atheists and persons who practice every iniquity and wickedness
live on to the last, unvisited by calamity, whilst, on the contrary,
those who have manifestly lived an exemplary life in respect of every
virtue, live in pain, in insult, in calumny and outrage, and suffering
of all kinds) or after death (for both together no longer exist, the
soul being separated from the body, and the body itself being resolved
again into the materials out of which it was composed, and no longer
retaining anything of its former structure or form, much less the
remembrance of its actions): the result of all this is very plain to
every one,—namely, that, in the language of the apostle, “this
corruptible (and dissoluble) must put on incorruption,” <span
id="fr_845"></span>[846](#fn_845.md) in order that those who were dead,
having been made alive by the resurrection, and the parts that were
separated and entirely dissolved having been again united, each one may,
in accordance with justice, receive what he has done by the body,
whether it be good or bad.
