##### <span id="v.iii.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.—Reference to the Processes of Digestion and Nutrition.

<span id="v.iii.v-p1"></span>But it appears to me that such persons, in
the first place, are ignorant of the power and skill of Him that
fashioned and regulates this universe, who has adapted to the nature and
kind of each animal the nourishment suitable and correspondent to it,
and has neither ordained that everything in nature shall enter into
union and combination with every kind of body, nor is at any loss to
separate what has been so united, but grants to the nature of each
several created being or thing to do or to suffer what is naturally
suited to it, and sometimes also hinders and allows or forbids whatever
He wishes, and for the purpose He wishes; and, moreover, that they have
not considered the power and nature of each of the creatures that
nourish or are nourished. Otherwise they would have known that not
everything which is taken for food under the pressure of outward
necessity turns out to be suitable nourishment for the animal, but that
some things no sooner come into contact with the plicatures of the
stomach than they are wont to be corrupted, and are vomited or voided,
or disposed of in some other way, so that not even for a little time do
they undergo the first and natural digestion, much less become
incorporated with that which is to be nourished; as also, that not even
everything which has been digested in the stomach and received the first
change actually arrives at the parts to be nourished, since some of it
loses its nutritive power even in the stomach, and some during the
second change, and the digestion that takes place in the liver is
separated and passes into something else which is destitute of the power
to nourish; nay, that the change which takes place in the liver does not
all issue in nourishment to men, but the matter changed is separated as
refuse according to its natural purpose; and that the nourishment which
is left in the members and parts themselves that have to be nourished
sometimes changes to something else, according as that predominates
which is present in greater or less <span
id="fr_835"></span>[836](#fn_835.md) abundance, and is apt to corrupt or to
turn into itself that which comes near it.
