##### <span id="iii.ii.xxvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXVI.—Ridicule of the Studies of the Greeks.

<span id="iii.ii.xxvi-p1"></span>Cease to make a parade of sayings which
you have derived from others, and to deck yourselves like the daw in
borrowed plumes. If each state were to take away its contribution to
your speech, your fallacies would lose their power. While inquiring what
God is, you are ignorant of what is in yourselves; and, while staring
all agape at the sky, you stumble into pitfalls. The reading of your
books is like walking through a labyrinth, and their readers resemble
the cask of the Danaïds. Why do you divide time, saying that one part is
past, and another present, and another future? For how can the future be
passing when the present exists? As those who are sailing imagine in
their ignorance, as the ship is borne along, that the hills are in
motion, so you do not know that it is you who are passing along, but
that time (<span class="Greek"><span id="iii.ii.xxvi-p1.1"></span>ὁ
αἰών</span>) remains present as long as the Creator wills it to exist.
Why am I called to account for uttering my opinions, and why are you in
such haste to put them all down? Were not you born in the same manner as
ourselves, and placed under the same government of the world? Why say
that wisdom is with you alone, who have not another sun, nor other
risings of the stars, nor a more distinguished origin, nor a death
preferable to that of other men? The grammarians have been the beginning
of this idle talk; and you who parcel out wisdom are cut off from the
wisdom that is according to truth, and assign the names of the several
parts to particular men; and you know not God, but in your fierce
contentions destroy one another. And on this account you are all nothing
worth. While you arrogate to yourselves the sole right of discussion,
you discourse like the blind man with the deaf. Why do you handle the
builder’s tools without knowing how to build? Why do you busy yourselves
with words, while you keep aloof from deeds, puffed up with praise, but
cast down by misfortunes? Your modes of acting are contrary to reason,
for you make a pompons appearance in public, but hide your teaching in
corners. Finding you to be such men as these, we have abandoned you, and
no longer concern ourselves with your tenets, but follow the word of
God. Why, O man, do you set the letters of the alphabet at war with one
another? Why do you, as in a boxing match, make their sounds clash
together with your mincing Attic way of speaking, whereas you ought to
speak more according to nature? For if you adopt the Attic dialect
though not an Athenian, pray why do you not speak like the Dorians? How
is it that one appears to you more rugged, the other more pleasant for
intercourse?
