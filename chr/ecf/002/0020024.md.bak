#### <span id="ii.iv.ii-p0.1"></span>Similitude Second.

##### <span id="ii.iv.ii-p0.2"></span>As the Vine is Supported by the Elm, So is the Rich Man Helped by the Prayer of the Poor.

<span id="ii.iv.ii-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.ii-p1.1"></span>As</span> I was walking in the field, and
observing an elm and vine, and determining in my own mind respecting
them and their fruits, the Shepherd appears to me, and says, “What is it
that you are thinking about the elm and vine?” “I am considering,” I
reply, “that they become each other exceedingly well.” “These two
trees,” he continues, “are intended as an example for the servants of
God.” “I would like to know,” said I, “the example which these trees you
say, are intended to teach.” “Do you see,” he says, “the elm and the
vine?” “I see them sir,” I replied. “This vine,” he continued, “produces
fruit, and the elm is an unfruitful tree; but unless the vine be trained
upon the elm, it cannot bear much fruit when extended at length upon the
ground; <span id="fr_250"></span>[251](#fn_250.md) and the fruit which it
does bear is rotten, because the plant is not suspended upon the elm.
When, therefore, the vine is cast upon the elm, it yields fruit both
from itself and from the elm. You see, moreover, that the elm also
produces much fruit, not less than the vine, but even more;
because,” <span id="fr_251"></span>[252](#fn_251.md) he continued, “the
vine, when suspended upon the elm, yields much fruit, and good; but when
thrown upon the ground, what it produces is small and rotten. This
similitude, <span id="fr_252"></span>[253](#fn_252.md) therefore, is for
the servants of God—for the poor man and for the rich.” “How so, sir?”
said I; “explain the matter to me.” “Listen,” he said: “The rich man has
much wealth, but is poor in matters relating to the Lord, because he is
distracted about his riches; and he offers very few confessions and
intercessions to the Lord, and those which he does offer are small and
weak, and have no power above. But when the rich man refreshes <span
id="fr_253"></span>[254](#fn_253.md) the poor, and assists him in his
necessities, believing that what he does to the poor man will be able to
find its reward with God—because the poor man is rich in intercession
and confession, and his intercession has great power with God—then the
rich man helps the poor in all things without hesitation; and the poor
man, being helped by the rich, intercedes for him, giving thanks to God
for him who bestows gifts upon him. And he still continues to interest
himself zealously for the poor man, that his wants may be constantly
supplied. For he knows that the intercession of the poor man is
acceptable and influential <span id="fr_254"></span>[255](#fn_254.md) with
God. Both, accordingly, accomplish their work. The poor man makes
intercession; a work in which he is rich, which he received from the
Lord, and with which he recompenses the master who helps him. And the
rich man, in like manner, unhesitatingly bestows upon the poor man the
riches which he received from the Lord. And this is a great work, and
acceptable before God, because he understands the object of his wealth,
and has given to the poor of the gifts of the Lord, and rightly
discharged his service to Him. <span id="fr_255"></span>[256](#fn_255.md)
Among men, however, the elm appears not to produce fruit, and they do
not know nor understand that if a drought come, the elm, which contains
water, nourishes the vine; and the vine, having an unfailing supply of
water, yields double fruit both for itself and for the elm. So also poor
men interceding with the Lord on behalf of the rich, increase their
riches; and the rich, again, aiding the poor in their necessities,
satisfy their souls. Both, therefore, are partners in the righteous
work. He who does these things shall not be deserted by God, but shall
be enrolled in the books of the living. Blessed are they who have
riches, and who understand that they are from the Lord. \[For they who
are of that mind will be able to do some good. <span

id="ii.iv.ii-p1.2"></span>

<span id="ii.iv.ii-p2"></span> The Vatican reads: “Unless this vine be
attached to the elm, and rest upon it, it cannot bear much fruit. For,
lying upon the ground, it produces bad fruit, because it is not
suspended upon the elm.”

<span id="fn_251"></span>[32:252](0020024.htm#fr_251.md) <span
id="ii.iv.ii-p2.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iv.ii-p3"></span> The Vatican here makes Hermas interrupt
the Shepherd, and ask, “How greater than the vine?”

<span id="ii.iv.ii-p4"></span> \[Based on [Jas. i.

27, and ii. 1–9: introducing the heathen world to just ideas of human
brotherhood, and the mutual relations of the poor and the rich.\]

<span id="fn_253"></span>[32:254](0020024.htm#fr_253.md) <span
id="ii.iv.ii-p4.2"></span>

<span id="ii.iv.ii-p5"></span> The translation of the text is based on
the Palatine. Lips. Reads: “When the rich man fills out upon the poor.”
Hilgenfeld amends this: “When the rich man recovers breath upon the
poor.” Neither gives sense. The Æthiopic has: “But if the rich man lean
on the poor;” and the Greek of Hilgenfeld might mean: “When the rich man
recovers his breath by leaning on the poor.” The Vatican is quite
different: “When, therefore, the rich man helps the poor in those things
which he needs, the poor man prays to the Lord for the rich man, and God
bestows all blessings upon the rich man, because the poor man is rich in
prayer, and his prayer has great merit with God. Then the rich man
accordingly assists the poor man’s things, because he feels that he is
fully heard (*exaudiri*) by the Lord; and the more willingly and
unhesitatingly does he give him every help, and takes care that he wants
for nothing. The poor man gives thanks to God for the rich man, because
they do their duty in respect to the Lord (*a Domino*).”
