##### <span id="vi.iv.v.vii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VII.—The Egyptian Symbols and Enigmas of Sacred Things.

<span id="vi.iv.v.vii-p1"></span>Whence also the Egyptians did not
entrust the mysteries they possessed to all and sundry, and did not
divulge the knowledge of divine things to the profane; but only to those
destined to ascend the throne, and those of the priests that were judged
the worthiest, from their nurture, culture, and birth. Similar, then, to
the Hebrew enigmas in respect to concealment, are those of the Egyptians
also. Of the Egyptians, some show the sun on a ship, others on a
crocodile. And they signify hereby, that the sun, making a passage
through the delicious and moist air, generates time; which is symbolized
by the crocodile in some other sacerdotal account. Further, at Diospolis
in Egypt, on the temple called Pylon, there was figured a boy as the
symbol of production, and an old man as that of decay. A hawk, on the
other hand, was the symbol of God, as a fish of hate; and, according to
a different symbolism, the crocodile of impudence. The whole symbol,
then, when put together, appears to teach this: “Oh ye who are born and
die, God hates impudence.”

<span id="vi.iv.v.vii-p2"></span>And there are those who fashion ears
and eyes of costly material, and consecrate them, dedicating them in the
temples to the gods—by this plainly indicating that God sees and hears
all things. Besides, the lion is with them the symbol of strength and
prowess, as the ox clearly is of the earth itself, and husbandry and
food, and the horse of fortitude and confidence; while, on the other
hand, the sphinx, of strength combined with intelligence—as it had a
body entirely that of a lion, and the face of a man. Similarly to these,
to indicate intelligence, and memory, and power, and art, a man is
sculptured in the temples. And in what is called among them the Komasiæ
of the gods, they carry about golden images—two dogs, one hawk, and one
ibis; and the four figures of the images they call four letters. For the
dogs are symbols of the two hemispheres, which, as it were, go round and
keep watch; the hawk, of the sun, for it is fiery and destructive (so
they attribute pestilential diseases to the sun); the ibis, of the moon,
likening the shady parts to that which is dark in plumage, and the
luminous to the light. And some will have it that by the dogs are meant
the tropics, which guard and watch the sun’s passage to the south and
north. The hawk signifies the equinoctial line, which is high and
parched with heat, as the ibis the ecliptic. For the ibis seems, above
other animals, to have furnished to the Egyptians the first rudiments of
the invention of number and measure, as the oblique line did of circles.
