##### <span id="vi.iv.i.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.—The Benefit of Culture.

<span id="vi.iv.i.vi-p1"></span>The readiness acquired by previous
training conduces much to the perception of such things as are
requisite; but those things which can be perceived only by mind are the
special exercise for the mind. And their nature is triple according as
we consider their quantity, their magnitude, and what can be predicated
of them. For the discourse which consists of demonstrations, implants in
the spirit of him who follows it, clear faith; so that he cannot
conceive of that which is demonstrated being different; and so it does
not allow us to succumb to those who assail us by fraud. In such
studies, therefore, the soul is purged from sensible things, and is
excited, so as to be able to see truth distinctly. For nutriment, and
the training which is maintained gentle, make noble natures; and noble
natures, when they have received such training, become still better than
before both in other respects, but especially in productiveness, as is
the case with the other creatures. Wherefore it is said, “Go to the ant,
thou sluggard, and become wiser than it, which provideth much and,
varied food in the harvest against the inclemency of winter.” <span
id="fr_1869"></span>[1870](#fn_1869) Or go to the bee, and learn how
laborious she is; for she, feeding on the whole meadow, produces one
honey-comb. And if “thou prayest in the closet,” as the Lord taught, “to
worship in spirit,” <span id="fr_1870"></span>[1871](#fn_1870) thy
management will no longer be solely occupied about the house, but also
about the soul, what must be bestowed on it, and how, and how much; and
what must be laid aside and treasured up in it; and when it ought to be
produced, and to whom. For it is not by nature, but by learning, that
people become noble and good, as people also become physicians and
pilots. We all in common, for example, see the vine and the horse. But
the husbandman will know if the vine be good or bad at fruit-bearing;
and the horseman will easily distinguish between the spiritless and the
swift animal. But that some are naturally predisposed to virtue above
others, certain pursuits of those, who are so naturally predisposed
above others, show. But that perfection in virtue is not the exclusive
property of those, whose natures are better, is proved, since also those
who by nature are ill-disposed towards virtue, in obtaining suitable
training, for the most part attain to excellence; and, on the other
hand, those whose natural dispositions are apt, become evil through
neglect.

<span id="vi.iv.i.vi-p4"></span>Again, God has created us naturally
social and just; whence justice must not be said to take its rise from
implantation alone. But the good imparted by creation is to be conceived
of as excited by the commandment; the soul being trained to be willing
to select what is noblest.

<span id="vi.iv.i.vi-p5"></span>But as we say that a man can be a
believer without learning, <span id="fr_1871"></span>[1872](#fn_1871) so
also we assert that it is impossible for a man without learning to
comprehend the things which are declared in the faith. But to adopt what
is well said, and not to adopt the reverse, is caused not simply by
faith, but by faith combined with knowledge. But if ignorance is want of
training and of instruction, then teaching produces knowledge of divine
and human things. But just as it is possible to live rightly in penury
of this world’s good things, so also in abundance. And we avow, that at
once with more ease and more speed will one attain to virtue through
previous training. But it is not such as to be unattainable without it;
but it is attainable only when they have learned, and have had their
senses exercised. <span id="fr_1872"></span>[1873](#fn_1872) “For
hatred,” says Solomon, “raises strife, but instruction guardeth the ways
of life;” <span id="fr_1873"></span>[1874](#fn_1873) in such a way that
we are not deceived nor deluded by those who are practiced in base arts
for the injury of those who hear. “But instruction wanders
reproachless,” <span id="fr_1874"></span>[1875](#fn_1874) it is said. We
must be conversant with the art of reasoning, for the purpose of
confuting the deceitful opinions of the sophists. Well and felicitously,
therefore, does Anaxarchus write in his book respecting “kingly rule:”
“Erudition benefits greatly and hurts greatly him who possesses it; it
helps him who is worthy, and injures him who utters readily every word,
and before the whole people. It is necessary to know the measure of
time. For this is the end of wisdom. And those who sing at the doors,
even if they sing skilfully, are not reckoned wise, but have the
reputation of folly.” And Hesiod:—

> <span id="vi.iv.i.vi-p9.2"></span> “Of the Muses, who make a man
> loquacious, divine, vocal.”  

<span id="vi.iv.i.vi-p10"></span> <span id="page_308">p. 308</span>
<span id="vi.iv.i.vi-Page_308"></span> For him who is fluent in words he
calls loquacious; and him who is clever, vocal; and “divine,” him who is
skilled, a philosopher, and acquainted with the truth.
