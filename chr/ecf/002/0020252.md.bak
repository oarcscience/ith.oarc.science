##### <span id="vi.iii.i.ii-p0.1"></span>Chapter II.—Our Instructor’s Treatment of Our Sins.

<span id="vi.iii.i.ii-p1"></span>Now, O you, my children, our Instructor
is like His Father God, whose son He is, sinless, <span id="page_210">p.
210</span> <span id="vi.iii.i.ii-Page_210"></span>blameless, and with a
soul devoid of passion; God in the form of man, stainless, the minister
of His Father’s will, the Word who is God, who is in the Father, who is
at the Father’s right hand, and with the form of God is God. He is to us
a spotless image; to Him we are to try with all our might to assimilate
our souls. He is wholly free from human passions; wherefore also He
alone is judge, because He alone is sinless. As far, however, as we can,
let us try to sin as little as possible. For nothing is so urgent in the
first place as deliverance from passions and disorders, and then the
checking of our liability to fall into sins that have become habitual.
It is best, therefore, not to sin at all in any way, which we assert to
be the prerogative of God alone; next to keep clear of voluntary
transgressions, which is characteristic of the wise man; thirdly, not to
fall into many involuntary offences, which is peculiar to those who have
been excellently trained. Not to continue long in sins, let that be
ranked last. But this also is salutary to those who are called back to
repentance, to renew the contest.

<span id="vi.iii.i.ii-p2"></span>And the Instructor, as I think, very
beautifully says, through Moses: “If any one die suddenly by him,
straightway the head of his consecration shall be polluted, and shall be
shaved,” <span id="fr_1036"></span>[1037](#fn_1036.md) designating
involuntary sin as sudden death. And He says that it pollutes by
defiling the soul: wherefore He prescribes the cure with all speed,
advising the head to be instantly shaven; that is, counselling the locks
of ignorance which shade the reason to be shorn clean off, that reason
(whose seat is in the brain), being left bare of the dense stuff of
vice, may speed its way to repentance. Then after a few remarks He adds,
“The days before are not reckoned irrational,” <span
id="fr_1037"></span>[1038](#fn_1037.md) by which manifestly sins are meant
which are contrary to reason. The involuntary act He calls “*sudden,*”
the sin He calls “irrational.” Wherefore the Word, the Instructor, has
taken the charge of us, in order to the prevention of sin, which is
contrary to reason.

<span id="vi.iii.i.ii-p5"></span>Hence consider the expression of
Scripture, “Therefore these things saith the Lord;” the sin that had
been committed before is held up to reprobation by the succeeding
expression “therefore,” according to which the righteous judgment
follows. This is shown conspicuously by the prophets, when they said,
“Hadst thou not sinned, He would not have uttered these threatenings.”
“Therefore thus saith the Lord;” “Because thou hast not heard these
words, therefore these things the Lord;” and, “Therefore, behold, the
Lord saith.” For prophecy is given by reason both of obedience and
disobedience: for obedience, that we may be saved; for disobedience,
that we may be corrected.

<span id="vi.iii.i.ii-p6"></span>Our Instructor, the Word, therefore
cures the unnatural passions of the soul by means of exhortations. For
with the highest propriety the help of bodily diseases is called the
healing art—an art acquired by human skill. But the paternal Word is the
only Pæonian physician of human infirmities, and the holy charmer of the
sick soul. “Save,” it is said, “Thy servant, O my God, who trusteth in
Thee. Pity me, O Lord; for I will cry to Thee all the day.” <span
id="fr_1038"></span>[1039](#fn_1038.md) For a while the “physician’s art,”
according to Democritus, “heals the diseases of the body; wisdom frees
the soul from passion.” But the good Instructor, the Wisdom, the Word of
the Father, who made man, cares for the whole nature of His creature;
the all-sufficient Physician of humanity, the Saviour, heals both body
and soul. “Rise up,” He said to the paralytic; “take the bed on which
thou liest, and go away home;” <span
id="fr_1039"></span>[1040](#fn_1039.md) and straightway the infirm man
received strength. And to the dead He said, “Lazarus, go forth;” <span
id="fr_1040"></span>[1041](#fn_1040.md) and the dead man issued from his
coffin such as he was ere he died, having undergone resurrection.
Further, He heals the soul itself by precepts and gifts—by precepts
indeed, in course of time, but being liberal in His gifts, He says to us
sinners, “Thy sins be forgiven thee.” <span
id="fr_1041"></span>[1042](#fn_1041.md)

<span id="vi.iii.i.ii-p11"></span>We, however, as soon as He conceived
the thought, became His children, having had assigned us the best and
most secure rank by His orderly arrangement, which first circles about
the world, the heavens, and the sun’s circuits, and occupies itself with
the motions of the rest of the stars for man’s behoof, and then busies
itself with man himself, on whom all its care is concentrated; and
regarding him as its greatest work, regulated his soul by wisdom and
temperance, and tempered the body with beauty and proportion. And
whatever in human actions is right and regular, is the result of the
inspiration of its rectitude and order.
