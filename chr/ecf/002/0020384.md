##### <span id="vi.iv.v.x-p0.1"></span>Chapter X.—The Opinion of the Apostles on Veiling the Mysteries of the Faith.

<span id="vi.iv.v.x-p1"></span>Rightly, therefore, the divine apostle
says, “By revelation the mystery was made known to me (as I wrote before
in brief, in accordance with which, when ye read, ye may understand my
knowledge in the mystery of Christ), which in other ages was not made
known to the sons of men, as it is now revealed to His holy apostles and
prophets.” <span id="fr_3051"></span>[3052](#fn_3051.md) For there is an
instruction of the perfect, of which, writing to the Colossians, he
says, “We cease not to pray for you, and beseech that ye may be filled
with the knowledge of His will in all wisdom and spiritual
understanding; that ye may walk worthy of the Lord to all pleasing;
being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of
God; strengthened with all might according to the glory of His
power.” <span id="fr_3052"></span>[3053](#fn_3052.md) And again he says,
“According to the disposition of the grace of God which is given me,
that ye may fulfil the word of God; the mystery which has been hid from
ages and generations, which now is manifested to His saints: to whom God
wished to make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery
among the nations.” <span id="fr_3053"></span>[3054](#fn_3053.md) So that,
on the one hand, then, are <span id="page_459">p. 459</span> <span
id="vi.iv.v.x-Page_459"></span>the mysteries which were hid till the
time of the apostles, and were delivered by them as they received from
the Lord, and, concealed in the Old Testament, were manifested to the
saints. And, on the other hand, there is “the riches of the glory of the
mystery in the Gentiles,” which is faith and hope in Christ; which in
another place he has called the “foundation.” <span
id="fr_3054"></span>[3055](#fn_3054.md) And again, as if in eagerness to
divulge this knowledge, he thus writes: “Warning every man in all
wisdom, that we may present every man (the whole man) perfect in
Christ;” not every man simply, since no one would be unbelieving. Nor
does he call every man who believes in Christ perfect; but he <span
id="fr_3055"></span>[3056](#fn_3055.md) says all the man, as if he said the
whole man, as if purified in body and soul. For that the knowledge does
not appertain to all, he expressly adds: “Being knit together in love,
and unto all the riches of the full assurance of knowledge, to the
acknowledgment of the mystery of God in Christ, in whom are hid all the
treasures of wisdom and of knowledge.” <span
id="fr_3056"></span>[3057](#fn_3056.md) “Continue in prayer, watching
therein with thanksgiving.” <span id="fr_3057"></span>[3058](#fn_3057.md)
And thanksgiving has place not for the soul and spiritual blessings
alone, but also for the body, and for the good things of the body. And
he still more clearly reveals that knowledge belongs not to all, by
adding: “Praying at the same time for you, that God would open to us a
door to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am bound; that I may
make it known as I ought to speak.” <span
id="fr_3058"></span>[3059](#fn_3058.md) For there were certainly, among the
Hebrews, some things delivered unwritten. “For when ye ought to be
teachers for the time,” it is said, as if they had grown old in the Old
Testament, “ye have again need that one teach you which be the first
principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of
milk, and not of solid food. For every one that partaketh of milk is
unskilful in the word of righteousness; for he is a babe, being
instructed with the first lessons. But solid food belongs to those who
are of full age, who by reason of use have their senses exercised so as
to distinguish between good and evil. Wherefore, leaving the first
principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on to perfection.” <span
id="fr_3059"></span>[3060](#fn_3059.md)

<span id="vi.iv.v.x-p11"></span>Barnabas, too, who in person preached
the word along with the apostle in the ministry of the Gentiles, says,
“I write to you most simply, that ye may understand.” Then below,
exhibiting already a clearer trace of gnostic tradition, he says, “What
says the other prophet Moses to them? Lo, thus saith the Lord God, Enter
ye into the good land which the Lord God sware, the God of Abraham, and
Isaac, and Jacob; and ye received for an inheritance that land, flowing
with milk and honey.” <span id="fr_3060"></span>[3061](#fn_3060.md) What
says knowledge? Learn, hope, it says, in Jesus, who is to be manifested
to you in the flesh. For man is the suffering land; for from the face of
the ground was the formation of Adam. What, then, does it say in
reference to the good land, flowing with milk and honey? Blessed be our
Lord, brethren, who has put into our hearts wisdom, and the
understanding of His secrets. For the prophet says, “Who shall
understand the Lord’s parable but the wise and understanding, and he
that loves his Lord?” It is but for few to comprehend these things. For
it is not in the way of envy that the Lord announced in a Gospel, “My
mystery is to me, and to the sons of my house;” placing the election in
safety, and beyond anxiety; so that the things pertaining to what it has
chosen and taken may be above the reach of envy. For he who has not the
knowledge of good is wicked: for there is one good, the Father; and to
be ignorant of the Father is death, as to know Him is eternal life,
through participation in the power of the incorrupt One. And to be
incorruptible is to participate in divinity; but revolt from the
knowledge of God brings corruption. Again the prophet says: “And I will
give thee treasures, concealed, dark, unseen; that they may know that I
am the <span class="sc"><span
id="vi.iv.v.x-p12.3"></span>Lord</span>.” <span
id="fr_3061"></span>[3062](#fn_3061.md) Similarly David sings: “For, lo,
Thou hast loved truth; the obscure and hidden things of wisdom hast Thou
showed me.” <span id="fr_3062"></span>[3063](#fn_3062.md) “Day utters
speech to day” <span id="fr_3063"></span>[3064](#fn_3063.md) (what is
clearly written), “and night to night proclaims knowledge” (which is
hidden in a mystic veil); “and there are no words or utterances whose
voices shall not be heard” by God, who said, “Shall one do what is
secret, and I shall not see him?”

<span id="vi.iv.v.x-p16"></span>Wherefore instruction, which reveals
hidden things, is called illumination, as it is the teacher only who
uncovers the lid of the ark, contrary to what the poets say, that “Zeus
stops up the jar of good things, but opens that of evil.” “For I know,”
says the apostle, “that when I come to you, I shall come in the fulness
of the blessing of Christ;” <span id="fr_3064"></span>[3065](#fn_3064.md)
designating the spiritual gift, and the gnostic communication, which
being present he desires to impart to them present as “the fulness of
Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery sealed in the ages of
eternity, but now manifested by the prophetic Scriptures, according to
the command of the eternal God, made known to all the nations, in order
to the obedience of faith,” that is, those <span id="page_460">p.
460</span> <span id="vi.iv.v.x-Page_460"></span>of the nations who
believe that it is. But only to a few of them is shown what those things
are which are contained in the mystery.

<span id="vi.iv.v.x-p18"></span>Rightly then, Plato, in the Epistles,
treating of God, says: “We must speak in enigmas; that should the tablet
come by any mischance on its leaves either by sea or land, he who reads
may remain ignorant.” For the God of the universe, who is above all
speech, all conception, all thought, can never be committed to writing,
being inexpressible even by His own power. And this too Plato showed, by
saying: “Considering, then, these things, take care lest some time or
other you repent on account of the present things, departing in a manner
unworthy. The greatest safeguard is not to write, but learn; for it is
utterly impossible that what is written will not vanish.”

<span id="vi.iv.v.x-p19"></span>Akin to this is what the holy Apostle
Paul says, preserving the prophetic and truly ancient secret from which
the teachings that were good were derived by the Greeks: “Howbeit we
speak wisdom among them who are perfect; but not the wisdom of this
world, or of the princes of this world, that come to nought; but we
speak the wisdom of God hidden in a mystery.” <span
id="fr_3065"></span>[3066](#fn_3065.md) Then proceeding, he thus inculcates
the caution against the divulging of his words to the multitude in the
following terms: “And I, brethren, could not speak to you as to
spiritual, but as to carnal, even to babes in Christ. I have fed you
with milk, not with meat: for ye were not yet able; neither are ye now
able. For ye are yet carnal.” <span id="fr_3066"></span>[3067](#fn_3066.md)

<span id="vi.iv.v.x-p22"></span>If, then, “the milk” is said by the
apostle to belong to the babes, and “meat” to be the food of the
full-grown, milk will be understood to be catechetical instruction—the
first food, as it were, of the soul. And meat is the mystic
contemplation; for this is the flesh and the blood of the Word, that is,
the comprehension of the divine power and essence. “Taste and see that
the Lord is Christ,” <span id="fr_3067"></span>[3068](#fn_3067.md) it is
said. For so He imparts of Himself to those who partake of such food in
a more spiritual manner; when now the soul nourishes itself, according
to the truth-loving Plato. For the knowledge of the divine essence is
the meat and drink of the divine Word. Wherefore also Plato says, in the
second book of the *Republic*, “It is those that sacrifice not a sow,
but some great and difficult sacrifice,” who ought to inquire respecting
God. And the apostle writes, “Christ our passover was sacrificed for
us;” <span id="fr_3068"></span>[3069](#fn_3068.md) —a sacrifice hard to
procure, in truth, the Son of God consecrated for us.
