##### <span id="vi.iii.i.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.—The Name Children Does Not Imply Instruction in Elementary Principles.

<span id="vi.iii.i.vi-p1"></span>We have ample means of encountering
those who are given to carping. For we are not termed children and
infants with reference to the childish and contemptible character of our
education, as those who are inflated on account of knowledge have
calumniously alleged. Straightway, on our regeneration, we attained that
perfection after which we aspired. For we were illuminated, which is to
know God. He is not then imperfect who knows what is perfect. And do not
reprehend me when I profess to know God; for so it was deemed right to
speak to the Word, and He is free. <span
id="fr_1081"></span>[1082](#fn_1081.md) For at the moment of the Lord’s
baptism there sounded a voice from heaven, as a testimony to the
Beloved, “Thou art My beloved Son, to-day have I begotten Thee.” Let us
then ask the wise, Is Christ, begotten to-day, already perfect, or—what
were most monstrous—imperfect? If the latter, there is some addition He
requires yet to make. But for Him to make any addition to His knowledge
is absurd, since He is God. For none can be superior to the Word, or the
teacher of the only Teacher. Will they not then own, though reluctant,
that the perfect Word born of the perfect Father was begotten in
perfection, according to œconomic fore-ordination? And if He was
perfect, why was He, the perfect one, baptized? It was necessary, they
say, to fulfil the profession that pertained to humanity. Most
excellent. Well, I assert, simultaneously with His baptism by John, He
becomes perfect? Manifestly. He did not then learn anything more from
him? Certainly not. But He is perfected by the washing—of baptism—alone,
and is sanctified by the descent of the Spirit? Such is the case. The
same also takes place in our case, whose exemplar Christ became. Being
baptized, we are illuminated; illuminated, we become sons; being made
sons, we are made perfect; being made perfect, we are made immortal.
“I,” says He, “have said that ye are gods, and all sons of the
Highest.” <span id="fr_1082"></span>[1083](#fn_1082.md) This work is
variously called grace, <span id="fr_1083"></span>[1084](#fn_1083.md) and
illumination, and perfection, and washing: washing, by which we cleanse
away our sins; grace, by which the penalties accruing to transgressions
are remitted; and illumination, by which that holy light of salvation is
beheld, that is, by which we see God clearly. Now we call that perfect
which wants nothing. For what is yet wanting to him who knows God? For
it were truly monstrous that that which is not complete should be called
a gift (or act) of God’s grace. Being perfect, He consequently bestows
perfect gifts. As at <span id="page_216">p. 216</span> <span
id="vi.iii.i.vi-Page_216"></span>His command all things were made, so on
His bare wishing to bestow grace, ensues the perfecting of His grace.
For the future of time is anticipated by the power of His volition.

<span id="vi.iii.i.vi-p5"></span>Further release from evils is the
beginning of salvation. We then alone, who first have touched the
confines of life, are already perfect; and we already live who are
separated from death. Salvation, accordingly, is the following of
Christ: “For that which is in Him is life. <span
id="fr_1084"></span>[1085](#fn_1084.md) “Verily, verily, I say unto you, He
that heareth My words, and believeth on Him that sent Me, hath eternal
life, and cometh not into condemnation, but hath passed from death to
life.” <span id="fr_1085"></span>[1086](#fn_1085.md) Thus believing alone,
and regeneration, is perfection in life; for God is never weak. For as
His will is work, and this <span id="fr_1086"></span>[1087](#fn_1086.md) is
named the world; so also His counsel is the salvation of men, and this
has been called the church. He knows, therefore, whom He has called, and
whom He has saved; and at one and the same time He called and saved
them. “For ye are,” says the apostle, “taught of God.” <span
id="fr_1087"></span>[1088](#fn_1087.md) It is not then allowable to think
of what is taught by Him as imperfect; and what is learned from Him is
the eternal salvation of the eternal Saviour, to whom be thanks for ever
and ever. Amen. And he who is only regenerated—as the name necessarily
indicates—and is enlightened, is delivered forthwith from darkness, and
on the instant receives the light.

<span id="vi.iii.i.vi-p10"></span>As, then, those who have shaken off
sleep forthwith become all awake within; or rather, as those who try to
remove a film that is over the eyes, do not supply to them from without
the light which they do not possess, but removing the obstacle from the
eyes, leave the pupil free; thus also we who are baptized, having wiped
off the sins which obscure the light of the Divine Spirit, have the eye
of the spirit free, unimpeded, and full of light, by which alone we
contemplate the Divine, the Holy Spirit flowing down to us from above.
This is the eternal adjustment of the vision, which is able to see the
eternal light, since like loves like; and that which is holy, loves that
from which holiness proceeds, which has appropriately been termed light.
“Once ye were darkness, now are ye light in the Lord.” <span
id="fr_1088"></span>[1089](#fn_1088.md) Hence I am of opinion man was
called by the ancients <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iii.i.vi-p11.2"></span>φώς</span>. <span
id="fr_1089"></span>[1090](#fn_1089.md) But he has not yet received, say
they, the perfect gift. I also assent to this; but he is in the light,
and the darkness comprehendeth him not. There is nothing intermediate
between light and darkness. But the end is reserved till the
resurrection of those who believe; and it is not the reception of some
other thing, but the obtaining of the promise previously made. For we do
not say that both take place together at the same time—both the arrival
at the end, and the anticipation of that arrival. For eternity and time
are not the same, neither is the attempt and the final result; but both
have reference to the same thing, and one and the same person is
concerned in both. Faith, so to speak, is the attempt generated in time;
the final result is the attainment of the promise, secured for eternity.
Now the Lord Himself has most clearly revealed the equality of
salvation, when He said: “For this is the will of my Father, that every
one that seeth the Son, and believeth on Him, should have everlasting
life; and I will raise him up in the last day.” <span
id="fr_1090"></span>[1091](#fn_1090.md) As far as possible in this world,
which is what he means by the last day, and which is preserved till the
time that it shall end, we believe that we are made perfect. Wherefore
He says, “He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life.” <span
id="fr_1091"></span>[1092](#fn_1091.md) If, then, those who have believed
have life, what remains beyond the possession of eternal life? Nothing
is wanting to faith, as it is perfect and complete in itself. If aught
is wanting to it, it is not wholly perfect. But faith is not lame in any
respect; nor after our departure from this world does it make us who
have believed, and received without distinction the earnest of future
good, wait; but having in anticipation grasped by faith that which is
future, after the resurrection we receive it as present, in order that
that may be fulfilled which was spoken, “Be it according to thy
faith.” <span id="fr_1092"></span>[1093](#fn_1092.md) And where faith is,
there is the promise; and the consummation of the promise is rest. So
that in illumination what we receive is knowledge, and the end of
knowledge is rest—the last thing conceived as the object of aspiration.
As, then, inexperience comes to an end by experience, and perplexity by
finding a clear outlet, so by illumination must darkness disappear. The
darkness is ignorance, through which we fall into sins, purblind as to
the truth. Knowledge, then, is the illumination we receive, which makes
ignorance disappear, and endows us with clear vision. Further, the
abandonment of what is bad is the adopting <span
id="fr_1093"></span>[1094](#fn_1093.md) of what is better. For what
ignorance has bound ill, is by knowledge loosed well; those bonds are
with all speed slackened by human faith and divine grace, our
transgressions being taken away by one Pœonian <span
id="fr_1094"></span>[1095](#fn_1094.md) medicine, the baptism of the Word.
We are washed from all our sins, and are no longer entangled in evil.
This is the one grace of illumination, <span id="page_217">p. 217</span>
<span id="vi.iii.i.vi-Page_217"></span>that our characters are not the
same as before our washing. And since knowledge springs up with
illumination, shedding its beams around the mind, the moment we hear, we
who were untaught become disciples. Does this, I ask, take place on the
advent of this instruction? You cannot tell the time. For instruction
leads to faith, and faith with baptism is trained by the Holy Spirit.
For that faith is the one universal salvation of humanity, and that
there is the same equality before the righteous and loving God, and the
same fellowship between Him and all, the apostle most clearly showed,
speaking to the following effect: “Before faith came, we were kept under
the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed, so
that the law became our schoolmaster to bring us to Christ, that we
might be justified by faith; but after that faith is come, we are no
longer under a schoolmaster.” <span id="fr_1095"></span>[1096](#fn_1095.md)
Do you not hear that we are no longer under that law which was
accompanied with fear, but under the Word, the master of free choice?
Then he subjoined the utterance, clear of all partiality: “For ye are
all the children of God through faith in Christ Jesus. For as many as
were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor
Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female:
for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.” <span
id="fr_1096"></span>[1097](#fn_1096.md) There are not, then, in the same
Word some “illuminated (gnostics); and some animal (or natural) men;”
but all who have abandoned the desires of the flesh are equal and
spiritual before the Lord. And again he writes in another place: “For by
one spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks,
whether bond or free, and we have all drunk of one cup.” <span
id="fr_1097"></span>[1098](#fn_1097.md) Nor were it absurd to employ the
expressions of those who call the reminiscence of better things the
filtration of the spirit, understanding by filtration the separation of
what is baser, that results from the reminiscence of what is better.
There follows of necessity, in him who has come to the recollection of
what is better, repentance for what is worse. Accordingly, they confess
that the spirit in repentance retraces its steps. In the same way,
therefore, we also, repenting of our sins, renouncing our iniquities,
purified by baptism, speed back to the eternal light, children to the
Father. Jesus therefore, rejoicing in the spirit, said: “I thank Thee, O
Father, God of heaven and earth, that Thou hast hid these things from
the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to babes;” <span
id="fr_1098"></span>[1099](#fn_1098.md) the Master and Teacher applying the
name babes to us, who are readier to embrace salvation than the wise in
the world, who, thinking themselves wise, are inflated with pride. And
He exclaims in exultation and exceeding joy, as if lisping with the
children, “Even so, Father; for so it seemed good in Thy sight.” <span
id="fr_1099"></span>[1100](#fn_1099.md) Wherefore those things which have
been concealed from the wise and prudent of this present world have been
revealed to babes. Truly, then, are we the children of God, who have put
aside the old man, and stripped off the garment of wickedness, and put
on the immortality of Christ; that we may become a new, holy people by
regeneration, and may keep the man undefiled. And a babe, as God’s
little one, <span id="fr_1100"></span>[1101](#fn_1100.md) is cleansed from
fornication and wickedness. With the greatest clearness the blessed Paul
has solved for us this question in his First Epistle to the Corinthians,
writing thus: “Brethren, be not children in understanding; howbeit in
malice be children, but in understanding be men.” <span
id="fr_1101"></span>[1102](#fn_1101.md) And the expression, “When I was a
child, I thought as a child, I spake as a child,” <span
id="fr_1102"></span>[1103](#fn_1102.md) points out his mode of life
according to the law, according to which, thinking childish things, he
persecuted, and speaking childish things he blasphemed the Word, not as
having yet attained to the simplicity of childhood, but as being in its
folly; for the word <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iii.i.vi-p25.2"></span>νήπιον</span> has two meanings. <span
id="fr_1103"></span>[1104](#fn_1103.md) “When I became a man,” again Paul
says, “I put away childish things.” <span
id="fr_1104"></span>[1105](#fn_1104.md) It is not incomplete size of
stature, nor a definite measure of time, nor additional secret teachings
in things that are manly and more perfect, that the apostle, who himself
professes to be a preacher of childishness, alludes to when he sends it,
as it were, into banishment; but he applies the name “children” to those
who are under the law, who are terrified by fear as children are by
bugbears; and “men” to us who are obedient to the Word and masters of
ourselves, who have believed, and are saved by voluntary choice, and are
rationally, not irrationally, frightened by terror. Of this the apostle
himself shall testify, calling as he does the Jews heirs according to
the first covenant, and us heirs according to promise: “*Now I say, as
long as the heir is a child, he differeth nothing from a servant, though
he be lord of all; but is under tutors and governors, till the time
appointed by the father. So also we, when we were children, were in
bondage under the rudiments of the world: but when the fulness of the
time was come, God sent forth His Son, made of a woman, made under the
law, to <span id="page_218">p. 218</span> <span
id="vi.iii.i.vi-Page_218"></span>redeem them that were under the law,
that we might receive the adoption of sons*” <span
id="fr_1105"></span>[1106](#fn_1105.md) by Him. See how He has admitted
those to be children who are under fear and sins; but has conferred
manhood on those who are under faith, by calling them sons, in
contradistinction from the children that are under the law: “For thou
art no more a servant,” he says, “but a son; and if a son, then an heir
through God.” <span id="fr_1106"></span>[1107](#fn_1106.md) What, then, is
lacking to the son after inheritance? Wherefore the expression, “When I
was a child,” may be elegantly expounded thus: that is, when I was a Jew
(for he was a Hebrew by extraction) I thought as a child, when I
followed the law; but after becoming a man, I no longer entertain the
sentiments of a child, that is, of the law, but of a man, that is, of
Christ, whom alone the Scripture calls man, as we have said before. “I
put away childish things.” But the childhood which is in Christ is
maturity, as compared with the law. Having reached this point, we must
defend our childhood. And we have still to explain what is said by the
apostle: “I have fed you with milk (as children in Christ), not with
meat; for ye were not able, neither yet are ye now able.” <span
id="fr_1107"></span>[1108](#fn_1107.md) For it does not appear to me that
the expression is to be taken in a Jewish sense; for I shall oppose to
it also that Scripture, “I will bring you into that good land which
flows with milk and honey.” <span id="fr_1108"></span>[1109](#fn_1108.md) A
very great difficulty arises in reference to the comparison of these
Scriptures, when we consider. For if the infancy which is characterized
by the milk is the beginning of faith in Christ, then it is disparaged
as childish and imperfect. How is the rest that comes after the meat,
the rest of the man who is perfect and endowed with knowledge, again
distinguished by infant milk? Does not this, as explaining a parable,
mean something like this, and is not the expression to be read somewhat
to the following effect: “*I have fed you with milk in Christ;*” and
after a slight stop, let us add, “as children,” that by separating the
words in reading we may make out some such sense as this: I have
instructed you in Christ with simple, true, and natural
nourishment,—namely, that which is spiritual: for such is the nourishing
substance of milk swelling out from breasts of love. So that the whole
matter may be conceived thus: As nurses nourish new-born children on
milk, so do I also by the Word, the milk of Christ, instilling into you
spiritual nutriment.

<span id="vi.iii.i.vi-p32"></span>Thus, then, the milk which is perfect
is perfect nourishment, and brings to that consummation which cannot
cease. Wherefore also the same milk and honey were promised in the rest.
Rightly, therefore, the Lord again promises milk to the righteous, that
the Word may be clearly shown to be both, “the Alpha and Omega,
beginning and end;” <span id="fr_1109"></span>[1110](#fn_1109.md) the Word
being figuratively represented as milk. Something like this Homer
oracularly declares against his will, when he calls righteous men
milk-fed (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iii.i.vi-p33.2"></span>γαλακτοφάγοι</span>). <span
id="fr_1110"></span>[1111](#fn_1110.md) So also may we take the Scripture:
“And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as
unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ;” <span
id="fr_1111"></span>[1112](#fn_1111.md) so that the carnal may be
understood as those recently instructed, and still babes in Christ. For
he called those who had already believed on the Holy Spirit spiritual,
and those newly instructed and not yet purified carnal; whom with
justice he calls still carnal, as minding equally with the heathen the
things of the flesh: “For whereas there is among you envy and strife,
are ye not carnal, and walk as men?” <span
id="fr_1112"></span>[1113](#fn_1112.md) “Wherefore also I have given you
milk to drink,” he says; meaning, I have instilled into you the
knowledge which, from instruction, nourishes up to life eternal. But the
expression, “I have given you to drink” (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iii.i.vi-p36.2"></span>ἐπότισα</span>), is the symbol of perfect
appropriation. For those who are full-grown are said to drink, babes to
suck. “For my blood,” says the Lord, “is true drink.” <span
id="fr_1113"></span>[1114](#fn_1113.md) In saying, therefore, “I have given
you milk to drink,” has he not indicated the knowledge of the truth, the
perfect gladness in the Word, who is the milk? And what follows next,
“not meat, for ye were not able,” may indicate the clear revelation in
the future world, like food, face to face. “For now we see as through a
glass,” the same apostle says, “but then face to face.” <span
id="fr_1114"></span>[1115](#fn_1114.md) Wherefore also he has added,
“neither yet are ye now able, for ye are still carnal,” minding the
things of the flesh,—desiring, loving, feeling jealousy, wrath, envy.
“For we are no more in the flesh,” <span
id="fr_1115"></span>[1116](#fn_1115.md) as some suppose. For with it \[they
say\], having the face which is like an angel’s, we shall see the
promise face to face. How then, if that is truly the promise after our
departure hence, say they that they know “what eye hath not known, nor
hath entered into the mind of man,” who have not perceived by the
Spirit, but received from instruction “what ear hath not heard,” <span
id="fr_1116"></span>[1117](#fn_1116.md) or that ear alone which “was rapt
up into the third heaven?” <span id="fr_1117"></span>[1118](#fn_1117.md)
But it even then was commanded to preserve it unspoken.

<span id="vi.iii.i.vi-p42"></span>But if human wisdom, as it remains to
understand, is the glorying in knowledge, hear the law <span
id="page_219">p. 219</span> <span id="vi.iii.i.vi-Page_219"></span>of
Scripture: “Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, and let not the
mighty man glory in his might; but let him that glorieth glory in the
Lord.” <span id="fr_1118"></span>[1119](#fn_1118.md) But we are God-taught,
and glory in the name of Christ. How then are we not to regard the
apostle as attaching this sense to the milk of the babes? And if we who
preside over the Churches are shepherds after the image of the good
Shepherd, and you the sheep, are we not to regard the Lord as preserving
consistency in the use of figurative speech, when He speaks also of the
milk of the flock? And to this meaning we may secondly accommodate the
expression, “I have given you milk to drink, and not given you food, for
ye are not yet able,” regarding the meat not as something different from
the milk, but the same in substance. For the very same Word is fluid and
mild as milk, or solid and compact as meat. And entertaining this view,
we may regard the proclamation of the Gospel, which is universally
diffused, as milk; and as meat, faith, which from instruction is
compacted into a foundation, which, being more substantial than hearing,
is likened to meat, and assimilates to the soul itself nourishment of
this kind. Elsewhere the Lord, in the Gospel according to John, brought
this out by symbols, when He said: “Eat ye my flesh, and drink my
blood;” <span id="fr_1119"></span>[1120](#fn_1119.md) describing distinctly
by metaphor the drinkable properties of faith and the promise, by means
of which the Church, like a human being consisting of many members, is
refreshed and grows, is welded together and compacted of both,—of faith,
which is the body, and of hope, which is the soul; as also the Lord of
flesh and blood. For in reality the blood of faith is hope, in which
faith is held as by a vital principle. And when hope expires, it is as
if blood flowed forth; and the vitality of faith is destroyed. If, then,
some would oppose, saying that by milk is meant the first lessons—as it
were, the first food—and that by meat is meant those spiritual
cognitions to which they attain by raising themselves to knowledge, let
them understand that, in saying that meat is solid food, and the flesh
and blood of Jesus, they are brought by their own vainglorious wisdom to
the true simplicity. For the blood is found to be an original product in
man, and some have consequently ventured to call it the substance of the
soul. And this blood, transmuted by a natural process of assimilation in
the pregnancy of the mother, through the sympathy of parental affection,
effloresces and grows old, in order that there may be no fear for the
child. Blood, too, is the moister part of flesh, being a kind of liquid
flesh; and milk is the sweeter and finer part of blood. For whether it
be the blood supplied to the fœtus, and sent through the navel of the
mother, or whether it be the menses themselves shut out from their
proper passage, and by a natural diffusion, bidden by the all-nourishing
and creating God, proceed to the already swelling breasts, and by the
heat of the spirits transmuted, \[whether it be the one or the other\]
that is formed into food desirable for the babe, that which is changed
is the blood. For of all the members, the breasts have the most sympathy
with the womb. When there is parturition, the vessel by which blood was
conveyed to the fœtus is cut off: there is an obstruction of the flow,
and the blood receives an impulse towards the breasts; and on a
considerable rush taking place, they are distended, and change the blood
to milk in a manner analogous to the change of blood into pus in
ulceration. Or if, on the other hand, the blood from the veins in the
vicinity of the breasts, which have been opened in pregnancy, is poured
into the natural hollows of the breasts; and the spirit discharged from
the neighbouring arteries being mixed with it, the substance of the
blood, still remaining pure, it becomes white by being agitated like a
wave; and by an interruption such as this is changed by frothing it,
like what takes place with the sea, which at the assaults of the winds,
the poets say, “spits forth briny foam.” Yet still the essence is
supplied by the blood.

<span id="vi.iii.i.vi-p45"></span>In this way also the rivers, borne on
with rushing motion, and fretted by contact with the surrounding air,
murmur forth foam. The moisture in our mouth, too, is whitened by the
breath. What an absurdity <span id="fr_1120"></span>[1121](#fn_1120.md) is
it, then, not to acknowledge that the blood is converted into that very
bright and white substance by the breath! The change it suffers is in
quality, not in essence. You will certainly find nothing else more
nourishing, or sweeter, or whiter than milk. In every respect,
accordingly, it is like spiritual nourishment, which is sweet through
grace, nourishing as life, bright as the day of Christ.

<span id="vi.iii.i.vi-p47"></span>The blood of the Word has been also
exhibited as milk. Milk being thus provided in parturition, is supplied
to the infant; and the breasts, which till then looked straight towards
the husband, now bend down towards the child, being taught to furnish
the substance elaborated by nature in a way easily received for salutary
nourishment. For the breasts are not like fountains full of milk,
flowing in ready prepared; but, by effecting a change in the nutriment,
form the milk in themselves, and discharge it. And the nutriment
suitable and wholesome for the new-formed and new-born babe is
elaborated by God, the nourisher and the Father of all that are
generated and regenerated,—as manna, the celestial food of <span
id="page_220">p. 220</span> <span
id="vi.iii.i.vi-Page_220"></span>angels, flowed down from heaven on the
ancient Hebrews. Even now, in fact, nurses call the first-poured drink
of milk by the same name as that food—manna. Further, pregnant women, on
becoming mothers, discharge milk. But the Lord Christ, the fruit of the
Virgin, did not pronounce the breasts of women blessed, nor selected
them to give nourishment; but when the kind and loving Father had rained
down the Word, Himself became spiritual nourishment to the good. O
mystic marvel! The universal Father is one, and one the universal Word;
and the Holy Spirit is one and the same everywhere, and one is the only
virgin mother. I love to call her the Church. This mother, when alone,
had not milk, because alone she was not a woman. But she is once virgin
and mother—pure as a virgin, loving as a mother. And calling her
children to her, she nurses them with holy milk, viz., with the Word for
childhood. Therefore she had not milk; for the milk was this child fair
and comely, the body of Christ, which nourishes by the Word the young
brood, which the Lord Himself brought forth in throes of the flesh,
which the Lord Himself swathed in His precious blood. O amazing birth! O
holy swaddling bands! The Word is all to the child, both father and
mother and tutor and nurse. “Eat ye my flesh,” He says, “and drink my
blood.” <span id="fr_1121"></span>[1122](#fn_1121.md) Such is the suitable
food which the Lord ministers, and He offers His flesh and pours forth
His blood, and nothing is wanting for the children’s growth. O amazing
mystery! We are enjoined to cast off the old and carnal corruption, as
also the old nutriment, receiving in exchange another new regimen, that
of Christ, receiving Him if we can, to hide Him within; and that,
enshrining the Saviour in our souls, we may correct the affections of
our flesh.

<span id="vi.iii.i.vi-p49"></span>But you are not inclined to understand
it thus, but perchance more generally. Hear it also in the following
way. The flesh figuratively represents to us the Holy Spirit; for the
flesh was created by Him. The blood points out to us the Word, for as
rich blood the Word has been infused into life; and the union of both is
the Lord, the food of the babes—the Lord who is Spirit and Word. The
food—that is, the Lord Jesus—that is, the Word of God, the Spirit made
flesh, the heavenly flesh sanctified. The nutriment is the milk of the
Father, by which alone we infants are nourished. The Word Himself, then,
the beloved One, and our nourisher, hath shed His own blood for us, to
save humanity; and by Him, we, believing on God, flee to the Word, “the
care-soothing breast” of the Father. And He alone, as is befitting,
supplies us children with the milk of love, and those only are truly
blessed who suck this breast. Wherefore also Peter says: “Laying
therefore aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisy, and envy, and
evil speaking, as new-born babes, desire the milk of the word, that ye
may grow by it to salvation; if ye have tasted that the Lord is
Christ.” <span id="fr_1122"></span>[1123](#fn_1122.md) And were one to
concede to them that the meat was something different from the milk,
then how shall they avoid being transfixed on their own spit, through
want of consideration of nature? <span
id="fr_1123"></span>[1124](#fn_1123.md) For in winter, when the air is
condensed, and prevents the escape of the heat enclosed within, the
food, transmuted and digested and changed into blood, passes into the
veins, and these, in the absence of exhalation, are greatly distended,
and exhibit strong pulsations; consequently also nurses are then fullest
of milk. And we have shown a little above, that on pregnancy blood
passes into milk by a change which does not affect its substance, just
as in old people yellow hair changes to grey. But again in summer, the
body, having its pores more open, affords greater facility for
diaphoretic action in the case of the food, and the milk is least
abundant, since neither is the blood full, nor is the whole nutriment
retained. If, then, the digestion of the food results in the production
of blood, and the blood becomes milk, then blood is a preparation for
milk, as blood is for a human beings, and the grape for the vine. With
milk, then, the Lord’s nutriment, we are nursed directly we are born;
and as soon as we are regenerated, we are honoured by receiving the good
news of the hope of rest, even the Jerusalem above, in which it is
written that milk and honey fall in showers, receiving through what is
material the pledge of the sacred food. “For meats are done away
with,” <span id="fr_1124"></span>[1125](#fn_1124.md) as the apostle himself
says; but this nourishment on milk leads to the heavens, rearing up
citizens of heaven, and members of the angelic choirs. And since the
Word is the gushing fountain of life, and has been called a river of
olive oil, Paul, using appropriate figurative language, and calling Him
milk, adds: “I have given you to drink;” <span
id="fr_1125"></span>[1126](#fn_1125.md) for we drink in the word, the
nutriment of the truth. In truth, also liquid food is called drink; and
the same thing may somehow be both meat and drink, according to the
different aspects in which it is considered, just as cheese is the
solidification of milk or milk solidified; for I am not concerned here
to make a nice selection of an expression, only to say that one
substance supplies both articles of food. Besides, for children at the
breast, milk alone suffices; it serves both for meat and drink. “I,”
<span id="page_221">p. 221</span> <span
id="vi.iii.i.vi-Page_221"></span>says the Lord, “have meat to eat that
ye know not of. My meat is to do the will of Him that sent Me.” <span
id="fr_1126"></span>[1127](#fn_1126.md) You see another kind of food which,
similarly with milk, represents figuratively the will of God. Besides,
also, the completion of His own passion He called catachrestically “a
cup,” <span id="fr_1127"></span>[1128](#fn_1127.md) when He alone had to
drink and drain it. Thus to Christ the fulfilling of His Father’s will
was food; and to us infants, who drink the milk of the word of the
heavens, Christ Himself is food. Hence seeking is called sucking; for to
those babes that seek the Word, the Father’s breasts of love supply
milk.

<span id="vi.iii.i.vi-p56"></span>Further, the Word declares Himself to
be the bread of heaven. “For Moses,” He says, “gave you not that bread
from heaven, but My Father giveth you the true bread from heaven. For
the bread of God is He that cometh down from heaven, and giveth life to
the world. And the bread which I will give is My flesh, which I will
give for the life of the world.” <span
id="fr_1128"></span>[1129](#fn_1128.md) Here is to be noted the mystery of
the bread, inasmuch as He speaks of it as flesh, and as flesh,
consequently, that has risen through fire, as the wheat springs up from
decay and germination; and, in truth, it has risen through fire for the
joy of the Church, as bread baked. But this will be shown by and by more
clearly in the chapter on the resurrection. But since He said, “And the
bread which I will give is My flesh,” and since flesh is moistened with
blood, and blood is figuratively termed wine, we are bidden to know
that, as bread, crumbled into a mixture of wine and water, seizes on the
wine and leaves the watery portion, so also the flesh of Christ, the
bread of heaven absorbs the blood; that is, those among men who are
heavenly, nourishing them up to immortality, and leaving only to
destruction the lusts of the flesh.

<span id="vi.iii.i.vi-p58"></span>Thus in many ways the Word is
figuratively described, as meat, and flesh, and food, and bread, and
blood, and milk. The Lord is all these, to give enjoyment to us who have
believed on Him. Let no one then think it strange, when we say that the
Lord’s blood is figuratively represented as milk. For is it not
figuratively represented as wine? “Who washes,” it is said, “His garment
in wine, His robe in the blood of the grape.” <span
id="fr_1129"></span>[1130](#fn_1129.md) In His own Spirit He says He will
deck the body of the Word; as certainly by His own Spirit He will
nourish those who hunger for the Word.

<span id="vi.iii.i.vi-p60"></span>And that the blood is the Word, is
testified by the blood of Abel, <span
id="fr_1130"></span>[1131](#fn_1130.md) the righteous interceding with God.
For the blood would never have uttered a voice, had it not been regarded
as the Word: for the righteous man of old is the type of the new
righteous one; and the blood of old that interceded, intercedes in the
place of the new blood. And the blood that is the Word cries to God,
since it intimated that the Word was to suffer.

<span id="vi.iii.i.vi-p62"></span>Further, this flesh, and the blood in
it, are by a mutual sympathy moistened and increased by the milk. And
the process of formation of the seed in conception ensues when it has
mingled with the pure residue of the menses, which remains. For the
force that is in the seed coagulating the substances of the blood, as
the rennet curdles milk, effects the essential part of the formative
process. For a suitable blending conduces to fruitfulness; but extremes
are adverse, and tend to sterility. For when the earth itself is flooded
by excessive rain, the seed is swept away, while in consequence of
scarcity it is dried up; but when the sap is viscous, it retains the
seed, and makes it germinate. Some also hold the hypothesis, that the
seed of an animal is in substance the foam of the blood, which being by
the natural heat of the male agitated and shaken out is turned into
foam, and deposited in the seminal veins. For Diogenes Apollionates will
have it, that hence is derived the word *aphrodisia.* <span
id="fr_1131"></span>[1132](#fn_1131.md)

<span id="vi.iii.i.vi-p64"></span>From all this it is therefore evident,
that the essential principle of the human body is blood. The contents of
the stomach, too, at first are milky, a coagulation of fluid; then the
same coagulated substance is changed into blood; but when it is formed
into a compact consistency in the womb, by the natural and warm spirit
by which the embryo is fashioned, it becomes a living creature. Further
also, the child after birth is nourished by the same blood. For the flow
of milk is the product of the blood; and the source of nourishment is
the milk; by which a woman is shown to have brought forth a child, and
to be truly a mother, by which also she receives a potent charm of
affection. Wherefore the Holy Spirit in the apostle, using the voice of
the Lord, says mystically, “I have given you milk to drink.” <span
id="fr_1132"></span>[1133](#fn_1132.md) For if we have been regenerated
unto Christ, He who has regenerated us nourishes us with His own milk,
the Word; for it is proper that what has procreated should forthwith
supply nourishment to that which has been procreated. And as the
regeneration was conformably spiritual, so also was the nutriment of man
spiritual. In all respects, therefore, and in all things, we are brought
into union with Christ, into relationship through His blood, by which we
are redeemed; and into sympathy, in consequence of the nourishment which
flows from <span id="page_222">p. 222</span> <span
id="vi.iii.i.vi-Page_222"></span>the Word; and into immortality, through
His guidance:—

> <span id="vi.iii.i.vi-p65.2"></span> “Among men the bringing up of
> children  
> Often produces stronger impulses to love than the procreating of
> them.”  

<span id="vi.iii.i.vi-p66"></span>The same blood and milk of the Lord is
therefore the symbol of the Lord’s passion and teaching. Wherefore each
of us babes is permitted to make our boast in the Lord, while we
proclaim:—

> <span id="vi.iii.i.vi-p66.1"></span> “Yet of a noble sire and noble
> blood I boast me sprung.” <span id="fr_1133"></span>[1134](#fn_1133.md)  

<span id="vi.iii.i.vi-p68"></span>And that milk is produced from blood
by a change, is already clear; yet we may learn it from the flocks and
herds. For these animals, in the time of the year which we call spring,
when the air has more humidity, and the grass and meadows are juicy and
moist, are first filled with blood, as is shown by the distension of the
veins of the swollen vessels; and from the blood the milk flows more
copiously. But in summer again, the blood being burnt and dried up by
the heat, prevents the change, and so they have less milk.

<span id="vi.iii.i.vi-p69"></span>Further, milk has a most natural
affinity for water, as assuredly the spiritual washing has for the
spiritual nutriment. Those, therefore, that swallow a little cold water,
in addition to the above-mentioned milk, straightway feel benefit; for
the milk is prevented from souring by its combination with water, not in
consequence of any antipathy between them, but in consequence of the
water taking kindly to the milk while it is undergoing digestion.

<span id="vi.iii.i.vi-p70"></span>And such as is the union of the Word
with baptism, is the agreement of milk with water; for it receives it
alone of all liquids, and admits of mixture with water, for the purpose
of cleansing, as baptism for the remission of sins. And it is mixed
naturally with honey also, and this for cleansing along with sweet
nutriment. For the Word blended with love at once cures our passions and
cleanses our sins; and the saying,

> <span id="vi.iii.i.vi-p70.1"></span> “Sweeter than honey flowed the
> stream of speech,” <span id="fr_1134"></span>[1135](#fn_1134.md)  

<span id="vi.iii.i.vi-p72"></span>seems to me to have been spoken of the
Word, who is honey. And prophecy oft extols Him “above honey and the
honeycomb.” <span id="fr_1135"></span>[1136](#fn_1135.md)

<span id="vi.iii.i.vi-p74"></span>Furthermore, milk is mixed with sweet
wine; and the mixture is beneficial, as when suffering is mixed in the
cup in order to immortality. For the milk is curdled by the wine, and
separated, and whatever adulteration is in it is drained off. And in the
same way, the spiritual communion of faith with suffering man, drawing
off as serous matter the lusts of the flesh, commits man to eternity,
along with those who are divine, immortalizing him.

<span id="vi.iii.i.vi-p75"></span>Further, many also use the fat of
milk, called butter, for the lamp, plainly indicating by this enigma the
abundant unction of the Word, since He alone it is who nourishes the
infants, makes them grow, and enlightens them. Wherefore also the
Scripture says respecting the Lord, “He fed them with the produce of the
fields; they sucked honey from the rock, and oil from the solid rock,
butter of kine, and milk of sheep, with fat of lambs;” <span
id="fr_1136"></span>[1137](#fn_1136.md) and what follows He gave them. But
he that prophesies the birth of the child says: “Butter and honey shall
He eat.” <span id="fr_1137"></span>[1138](#fn_1137.md) And it occurs to me
to wonder how some dare call themselves perfect and gnostics, with ideas
of themselves above the apostle, inflated and boastful, when Paul even
owned respecting himself, “Not that I have already attained, or am
already perfect; but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for
which I am apprehended of Christ. Brethren, I count not myself to have
apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting the things which are
behind, and stretching forth to those that are before, I press toward
the mark, for the prize of the high calling in Christ Jesus.” <span
id="fr_1138"></span>[1139](#fn_1138.md) And yet he reckons himself perfect,
because he has been emancipated from his former life, and strives after
the better life, not as perfect in knowledge, but as aspiring after
perfection. Wherefore also he adds, “As many of us as are perfect, are
thus minded,” <span id="fr_1139"></span>[1140](#fn_1139.md) manifestly
describing perfection as the renunciation of sin, and regeneration into
the faith of the only perfect One, and forgetting our former sins.
