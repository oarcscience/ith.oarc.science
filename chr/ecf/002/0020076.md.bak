##### <span id="iii.ii.xl-p0.1"></span>Chapter XL.—Moses More Ancient and Credible Than the Heathen Heroes.

<span id="iii.ii.xl-p1"></span>Therefore, from what has been said it is
evident that Moses was older than the ancient heroes, wars, and demons.
And we ought rather to believe him, who stands before them in point of
age, than the Greeks, who, without being aware of it, <span
id="fr_512"></span>[513](#fn_512.md) drew his doctrines \[as\] from a
fountain. For many of the sophists among them, stimulated by curiosity,
endeavoured to adulterate whatever they learned from Moses, <span
id="fr_513"></span>[514](#fn_513.md) and from those who have philosophized
like him, first that they might be considered as having something of
their own, and secondly, that covering up by a certain rhetorical
artifice whatever things they did not understand, they might
misrepresent the truth as if it were a fable. But what the learned among
the Greeks have said concerning our polity and the history of our laws,
and how many and what kind of men have written of these things, will be
shown in the treatise against those who have discoursed of divine
things. <span id="fr_514"></span>[515](#fn_514.md)

obligations of the Greek sages to that “light shining in a dark place,”
i.e., amid an idolatrous world.\]
