##### <span id="vi.ii.i-p0.1"></span>Chapter I.—Exhortation to Abandon the Impious Mysteries of Idolatry for the Adoration of the Divine Word and God the Father.

<span id="vi.ii.i-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="vi.ii.i-p1.1"></span>Amphion</span> of Thebes and Arion of Methymna
were both minstrels, and both were renowned in story. They are
celebrated in song to this day in the chorus of the Greeks; the one for
having allured the fishes, and the other for having surrounded Thebes
with walls by the power of music. Another, a Thracian, a cunning master
of his art (he also is the subject of a Hellenic legend), tamed the wild
beasts by the mere might of song; and transplanted trees—oaks—by music.
I might tell you also the story of another, a brother to these—the
subject of a myth, and a minstrel—Eunomos the Locrian and the Pythic
grasshopper. A solemn Hellenic assembly had met at Pytho, to celebrate
the death of the Pythic serpent, when Eunomos sang the reptile’s
epitaph. Whether his ode was a hymn in praise of the serpent, or a
dirge, I am not able to say. But there was a contest, and Eunomos was
playing the lyre in the summer time: it was when the grasshoppers,
warmed by the sun, were chirping beneath the leaves along the hills; but
they were singing not to that dead dragon, but to God All-wise,—a lay
unfettered by rule, better than the numbers of Eunomos. The Locrian
breaks a string. The grasshopper sprang on the neck of the instrument,
and sang on it as on a branch; and the minstrel, adapting his strain to
the grasshopper’s song, made up for the want of the missing string. The
grasshopper then was attracted by the song of Eunomos, as the fable
represents, according to which also a brazen statue of Eunomos with his
lyre, and the Locrian’s ally in the contest, was erected at Pytho. But
of its own accord it flew to the lyre, and of its own accord sang, and
was regarded by the Greeks as a musical performer.

<span id="vi.ii.i-p2"></span>How, let me ask, have you believed vain
fables and supposed animals to be charmed by music; while Truth’s
shining face alone, as would seem, appears to you disguised, and is
looked on with incredulous eyes? And so Cithæron, and Helicon, and the
mountains of the Odrysi, and the initiatory rites of the Thracians,
mysteries of deceit, are hallowed and celebrated in hymns. For me, I am
pained at such calamities as form the subjects of tragedy, though but
myths; but by you the records of miseries are turned into dramatic
compositions.

<span id="vi.ii.i-p3"></span>But the dramas and the raving poets, now
quite intoxicated, let us crown with ivy; and distracted outright as
they are, in Bacchic fashion, with the satyrs, and the frenzied rabble,
and the rest of the demon crew, let us confine to Cithæron and Helicon,
now antiquated.

<span id="vi.ii.i-p4"></span>But let us bring from above out of heaven,
Truth, with Wisdom in all its brightness, and the sacred prophetic
choir, down to the holy mount of God; and let Truth, darting her light
to the most distant points, cast her rays all around on those that are
involved in darkness, and deliver men from delusion, stretching out her
very strong <span id="fr_856"></span>[857](#fn_856.md) right hand, which is
wisdom, for their salvation. And raising their eyes, and looking above,
let them abandon Helicon and Cithæron, and take up their abode in Sion.
“For out of Sion shall go forth the law, and the word of the <span
class="sc"><span id="vi.ii.i-p5.3"></span>Lord</span> from
Jerusalem,” <span id="fr_857"></span>[858](#fn_857.md) —the celestial Word,
the true athlete crowned in the theatre of the whole universe. What my
Eunomos sings is not the measure of Terpander, nor that of Capito, nor
the Phrygian, nor Lydian, nor Dorian, but the immortal measure of the
new harmony which bears God’s name—the new, the Levitical song. <span
id="fr_858"></span>[859](#fn_858.md)

> <span id="vi.ii.i-p7.2"></span> “Soother of pain, calmer of wrath,
> producing forgetfulness of all ills.” <span
> id="fr_859"></span>[860](#fn_859.md)  

<span id="vi.ii.i-p9"></span>Sweet and true is the charm of persuasion
which blends with this strain.

<span id="vi.ii.i-p10"></span>To me, therefore, that Thracian Orpheus,
that Theban, and that Methymnæan,—men, <span id="page_172">p. 172</span>
<span id="vi.ii.i-Page_172"></span>and yet unworthy of the name,—seem to
have been deceivers, who, under the pretence of poetry corrupting human
life, possessed by a spirit of artful sorcery for purposes of
destruction, celebrating crimes in their orgies, and making human woes
the materials of religious worship, were the first to entice men to
idols; nay, to build up the stupidity of the nations with blocks of wood
and stone,—that is, statues and images,—subjecting to the yoke of
extremest bondage the truly noble freedom of those who lived as free
citizens under heaven by their songs and incantations. But not such is
my song, which has come to loose, and that speedily, the bitter bondage
of tyrannizing demons; and leading us back to the mild and loving yoke
of piety, recalls to heaven those that had been cast prostrate to the
earth. It alone has tamed men, the most intractable of animals; the
frivolous among them answering to the fowls of the air, deceivers to
reptiles, the irascible to lions, the voluptuous to swine, the rapacious
to wolves. The silly are stocks and stones, and still more senseless
than stones is a man who is steeped in ignorance. As our witness, let us
adduce the voice of prophecy accordant with truth, and bewailing those
who are crushed in ignorance and folly: “For God is able of these stones
to raise up children to Abraham;” <span
id="fr_860"></span>[861](#fn_860.md) and He, commiserating their great
ignorance and hardness of heart who are petrified against the truth, has
raised up a seed of piety, sensitive to virtue, of those stones—of the
nations, that is, who trusted in stones. Again, therefore, some venomous
and false hypocrites, who plotted against righteousness, He once called
“a brood of vipers.” <span id="fr_861"></span>[862](#fn_861.md) But if one
of those serpents even is willing to repent, and follows the Word, he
becomes a man of God.

<span id="vi.ii.i-p13"></span>Others he figuratively calls wolves,
clothed in sheep-skins, meaning thereby monsters of rapacity in human
form. And so all such most savage beasts, and all such blocks of stone,
the celestial song has transformed into tractable men. “For even we
ourselves were sometime foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers
lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, hating one
another.” Thus speaks the apostolic Scripture: “But after that the
kindness and love of God our saviour to man appeared, not by works of
righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy, He saved
us.” <span id="fr_862"></span>[863](#fn_862.md) Behold the might of the new
song! It has made men out of stones, men out of beasts. Those, moreover,
that were as dead, not being partakers of the true life, have come to
life again, simply by becoming listeners to this song. It also composed
the universe into melodious order, and tuned the discord of the elements
to harmonious arrangement, so that the whole world might become harmony.
It let loose the fluid ocean, and yet has prevented it from encroaching
on the land. The earth, again, which had been in a state of commotion,
it has established, and fixed the sea as its boundary. The violence of
fire it has softened by the atmosphere, as the Dorian is blended with
the Lydian strain; and the harsh cold of the air it has moderated by the
embrace of fire, harmoniously arranging these the extreme tones of the
universe. And this deathless strain,—the support of the whole and the
harmony of all,—reaching from the centre to the circumference, and from
the extremities to the central part, has harmonized this universal frame
of things, not according to the Thracian music, which is like that
invented by Jubal, but according to the paternal counsel of God, which
fired the zeal of David. And He who is of David, and yet before him, the
Word of God, despising the lyre and harp, which are but lifeless
instruments, and having tuned by the Holy Spirit the universe, and
especially man,—who, composed of body and soul, is a universe in
miniature,—makes melody to God on this instrument of many tones; and to
this instrument—I mean man—he sings accordant: “For thou art my harp,
and pipe, and temple.” <span id="fr_863"></span>[864](#fn_863.md) —a harp
for harmony—a pipe by reason of the Spirit—a temple by reason of the
word; so that the first may sound, the second breathe, the third contain
the Lord. And David the king, the harper whom we mentioned a little
above, who exhorted to the truth and dissuaded from idols, was so far
from celebrating demons in song, that in reality they were driven away
by his music. Thus, when Saul was plagued with a demon, he cured him by
merely playing. A beautiful breathing instrument of music the Lord made
man, after His own image. And He Himself also, surely, who is the
supramundane Wisdom, the celestial Word, is the all-harmonious,
melodious, holy instrument of God. What, then, does this instrument—the
Word of God, the Lord, the New Song—desire? To open the eyes of the
blind, and unstop the ears of the deaf, and to lead the lame or the
erring to righteousness, to exhibit God to the foolish, to put a stop to
corruption, to conquer death, to reconcile disobedient children to their
father. The instrument of God loves mankind. The Lord pities, instructs,
exhorts, admonishes, saves, shields, and of His bounty promises us the
kingdom of heaven as a reward for learning; and the only advantage He
reaps is, that we are <span id="page_173">p. 173</span> <span
id="vi.ii.i-Page_173"></span>saved. For wickedness feeds on men’s
destruction; but truth, like the bee, harming nothing, delights only in
the salvation of men.

<span id="vi.ii.i-p16"></span>You have, then, God’s promise; you have
His love: become partaker of His grace. And do not suppose the song of
salvation to be new, as a vessel or a house is new. For “before the
morning star it was;” <span id="fr_864"></span>[865](#fn_864.md) and “in
the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was
God.” <span id="fr_865"></span>[866](#fn_865.md) Error seems old, but truth
seems a new thing.

<span id="vi.ii.i-p19"></span>Whether, then, the Phrygians are shown to
be the most ancient people by the goats of the fable; or, on the other
hand, the Arcadians by the poets, who describe them as older than the
moon; or, finally, the Egyptians by those who dream that this land first
gave birth to gods and men: yet none of these at least existed before
the world. But before the foundation of the world were we, who, because
destined to be in Him, pre-existed in the eye of God before,—we the
rational creatures of the Word of God, on whose account we date from the
beginning; for “in the beginning was the Word.” Well, inasmuch as the
Word was from the first, He was and is the divine source of all things;
but inasmuch as He has now assumed the name Christ, consecrated of old,
and worthy of power, he has been called by me the New Song. This Word,
then, the Christ, the cause of both our being at first (for He was in
God) and of our well-being, this very Word has now appeared as man, He
alone being both, both God and man—the Author of all blessings to us; by
whom we, being taught to live well, are sent on our way to life eternal.
For, according to that inspired apostle of the Lord, “the grace of God
which bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, teaching us, that,
denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly,
righteously, and godly, in this present world; looking for the blessed
hope, and appearing of the glory of the great God and our Saviour Jesus
Christ.” <span id="fr_866"></span>[867](#fn_866.md)

<span id="vi.ii.i-p21"></span>This is the New Song, <span
id="fr_867"></span>[868](#fn_867.md) the manifestation of the Word that was
in the beginning, and before the beginning. The Saviour, who existed
before, has in recent days appeared. He, who is in Him that truly is,
has appeared; for the Word, who “was with God,” and by whom all things
were created, has appeared as our Teacher. The Word, who in the
beginning bestowed on us life as Creator when He formed us, taught us to
live well when He appeared as our Teacher; that as God He might
afterwards conduct us to the life which never ends. He did not now for
the first time pity us for our error; but He pitied us from the first,
from the beginning. But now, at His appearance, lost as we already were,
He accomplished our salvation. For that wicked reptile monster, by his
enchantments, enslaves and plagues men even till now; inflicting, as
seems to me, such barbarous vengeance on them as those who are said to
bind the captives to corpses till they rot together. This wicked tyrant
and serpent, accordingly, binding fast with the miserable chain of
superstition whomsoever he can draw to his side from their birth, to
stones, and stocks, and images, and such like idols, may with truth be
said to have taken and buried living men with those dead idols, till
both suffer corruption together.

<span id="vi.ii.i-p23"></span>Therefore (for the seducer is one and the
same) he that at the beginning brought Eve down to death, now brings
thither the rest of mankind. Our ally and helper, too, is one and the
same—the Lord, who from the beginning gave revelations by prophecy, but
now plainly calls to salvation. In obedience to the apostolic
injunction, therefore, let us flee from “the prince of the power of the
air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience,” <span
id="fr_868"></span>[869](#fn_868.md) and let us run to the Lord the
saviour, who now exhorts to salvation, as He has ever done, as He did by
signs and wonders in Egypt and the desert, both by the bush and the
cloud, which, through the favour of divine love, attended the Hebrews
like a handmaid. By the fear which these inspired He addressed the
hard-hearted; while by Moses, learned in all wisdom, and Isaiah, lover
of truth, and the whole prophetic choir, in a way appealing more to
reason, He turns to the Word those who have ears to hear. Sometimes He
upbraids, and sometimes He threatens. Some men He mourns over, others He
addresses with the voice of song, just as a good physician treats some
of his patients with cataplasms, some with rubbing, some with
fomentations; in one case cuts open with the lancet, in another
cauterizes, in another amputates, in order if possible to cure the
patient’s diseased part or member. The Saviour has many tones of voice,
and many methods for the salvation of men; by threatening He admonishes,
by upbraiding He converts, by bewailing He pities, by the voice of song
He cheers. He spake by the burning bush, for the men of that day needed
signs and wonders.

<span id="vi.ii.i-p25"></span>He awed men by the fire when He made flame
to burst from the pillar of cloud—a token at once of grace and fear: if
you obey, there is the light; if you disobey, there is the fire; but
since humanity is nobler than the pillar or the bush, after them the
prophets uttered their voice,—the Lord Himself speaking in Isaiah, <span
id="page_174">p. 174</span> <span id="vi.ii.i-Page_174"></span>in
Elias,—speaking Himself by the mouth of the prophets. But if thou dost
not believe the prophets, but supposest both the men and the fire a
myth, the Lord Himself shall speak to thee, “who, being in the form of
God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but humbled
Himself,” <span id="fr_869"></span>[870](#fn_869.md) —He, the merciful God,
exerting Himself to save man. And now the Word Himself clearly speaks to
thee, shaming thy unbelief; yea, I say, the Word of God became man, that
thou mayest learn from man how man may become God. Is it not then
monstrous, my friends, that while God is ceaselessly exhorting us to
virtue, we should spurn His kindness and reject salvation?

<span id="vi.ii.i-p27"></span>Does not John also invite to salvation,
and is he not entirely a voice of exhortation? Let us then ask him, “Who
of men art thou, and whence?” He will not say Elias. He will deny that
he is Christ, but will profess himself to be “a voice crying in the
wilderness.” Who, then, is John? <span id="fr_870"></span>[871](#fn_870.md)
In a word, we may say, “The beseeching voice of the Word crying in the
wilderness.” What criest thou, O voice? Tell us also. “Make straight the
paths of the <span class="sc"><span
id="vi.ii.i-p28.2"></span>Lord</span>.” <span
id="fr_871"></span>[872](#fn_871.md) John is the forerunner, and that voice
the precursor of the Word; an inviting voice, preparing for salvation,—a
voice urging men on to the inheritance of the heavens, and through which
the barren and the desolate is childless no more. This fecundity the
angel’s voice foretold; and this voice was also the precursor of the
Lord preaching glad tidings to the barren woman, as John did to the
wilderness. By reason of this voice of the Word, therefore, the barren
woman bears children, and the desert becomes fruitful. The two voices
which heralded the Lord’s—that of the angel and that of John—intimate,
as I think, the salvation in store for us to be, that on the appearance
of this Word we should reap, as the fruit of this productiveness,
eternal life. The Scripture makes this all clear, by referring both the
voices to the same thing: “Let her hear who has not brought forth, and
let her who has not had the pangs of childbirth utter her voice: for
more are the children of the desolate, than of her who hath an
husband.” <span id="fr_872"></span>[873](#fn_872.md)

<span id="vi.ii.i-p31"></span>The angel announced to us the glad tidings
of a husband. John entreated us to recognise the husbandman, to seek the
husband. For this husband of the barren woman, and this husbandman of
the desert—who filled with divine power the barren woman and the
desert—is one and the same. For because many were the children of the
mother of noble rule, yet the Hebrew woman, once blessed with many
children, was made childless because of unbelief: the barren woman
receives the husband, and the desert the husbandman; then both become
mothers through the word, the one of fruits, the other of believers. But
to the unbelieving the barren and the desert are still reserved. For
this reason John, the herald of the Word, besought men to make
themselves ready against the coming of the Christ of God. <span
id="fr_873"></span>[874](#fn_873.md) And it was this which was signified by
the dumbness of Zacharias, which waited for fruit in the person of the
harbinger of Christ, that the Word, the light of truth, by becoming the
Gospel, might break the mystic silence of the prophetic enigmas. But if
thou desirest truly to see God, take to thyself means of purification
worthy of Him, not leaves of laurel fillets interwoven with wool and
purple; but wreathing thy brows with righteousness, and encircling them
with the leaves of temperance, set thyself earnestly to find Christ.
“For I am,” He says, “the door,” <span id="fr_874"></span>[875](#fn_874.md)
which we who desire to understand God must discover, that He may throw
heaven’s gates wide open to us. For the gates of the Word being
intellectual, are opened by the key of faith. No one knows God but the
Son, and he to whom the Son shall reveal Him. <span
id="fr_875"></span>[876](#fn_875.md) And I know well that He who has opened
the door hitherto shut, will afterwards reveal what is within; and will
show what we could not have known before, had we not entered in by
Christ, through whom alone God is beheld.
