##### <span id="vi.iv.i.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.—Against the Sophists.

<span id="vi.iv.i.iii-p1"></span>There is a great crowd of this
description: some of them, enslaved to pleasures and willing to
disbelieve, laugh at the truth which is worthy of all reverence, making
sport of its barbarousness. Some others, exalting themselves, endeavour
to discover calumnious objections to our words, furnishing captious
questions, hunters out of paltry sayings, practicers of miserable
artifices, wranglers, dealers in knotty points, as that Abderite says:—

> <span id="vi.iv.i.iii-p1.1"></span> “For mortals’ tongues are glib,
> and on them are many speeches;  
> And a wide range for words of all sorts in this place and that.”  

<span id="vi.iv.i.iii-p2"></span>And—

> <span id="vi.iv.i.iii-p2.1"></span> “Of whatever sort the word you
> have spoken, of the same sort you must hear.”  

<span id="vi.iv.i.iii-p3"></span>Inflated with this art of theirs, the
wretched Sophists, babbling away in their own jargon; toiling their
whole life about the division of names and the nature of the composition
and conjunction of sentences, show themselves greater chatterers than
turtle-doves; scratching and tickling, not in a manly way, in my
opinion, the ears of those who wish to be tickled.

> <span id="vi.iv.i.iii-p3.1"></span> “A river of silly words—not a
> dropping;”  

<span id="vi.iv.i.iii-p4"></span>just as in old shoes, when all the rest
is worn and is falling to pieces, and the tongue alone remains. The
Athenian Solon most excellently enlarges, and writes:—

> <span id="vi.iv.i.iii-p4.1"></span> “Look to the tongue, and to the
> words of the glozing man,  
> But you look on no work that has been done;  
> But each one of you walks in the steps of a fox,  
> And in all of you is an empty mind.”  

<span id="vi.iv.i.iii-p5"></span>This, I think, is signified by the
utterance of the Saviour, “The foxes have holes, but the Son of man hath
not where to lay His head.” <span id="fr_1839"></span>[1840](#fn_1839)
For on the believer alone, who is separated entirely from the rest, who
by the Scripture are called wild beasts, rests the head of the universe,
the kind and gentle Word, “who taketh the wise in their own craftiness.
For the <span class="sc"><span id="vi.iv.i.iii-p6.3"></span>Lord</span>
knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain;” <span
id="fr_1840"></span>[1841](#fn_1840) the Scripture calling those the
wise (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.i.iii-p7.4"></span>σοφούς</span>) who are skilled in words and
arts, sophists (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.i.iii-p7.5"></span>σοφιστάς</span>). Whence the Greeks also
applied the denominative appellation of wise and sophists (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.iv.i.iii-p7.6"></span>σοφοί, σοφισταί</span>)
to those who were versed in anything Cratinus accordingly, having in the
*Archilochii* enumerated the poets, said:—

> <span id="vi.iv.i.iii-p7.7"></span> “Such a hive of sophists have ye
> examined.”  

<span id="vi.iv.i.iii-p8"></span>And similarly Iophon, the comic poet,
in *Flute-playing Satyrs*, says:—

> <span id="vi.iv.i.iii-p8.1"></span> “For there entered  
> A band of sophists, all equipped.”  

<span id="vi.iv.i.iii-p9"></span>Of these and the like, who devote their
attention to empty words, the divine Scripture most excellently says, “I
will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and bring to nothing the
understanding of the prudent.” <span
id="fr_1841"></span>[1842](#fn_1841)
