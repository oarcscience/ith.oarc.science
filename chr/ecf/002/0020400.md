##### <span id="vi.iv.vi.x-p0.1"></span>Chapter X.—The Gnostic Avails Himself of the Help of All Human Knowledge.

<span id="vi.iv.vi.x-p1"></span>For to him knowledge (*gnosis*) is the
principal thing. Consequently, therefore, he applies to the subjects
that are a training for knowledge, taking from each branch of study its
contribution to the truth. Prosecuting, then, the proportion of
harmonies in music; and in arithmetic noting the increasing and
decreasing of numbers, and their relations to one another, and how the
most of things fall under some proportion of numbers; studying geometry,
which is abstract essence, he perceives a continuous distance, and an
immutable essence which is different from these bodies. And by
astronomy, again, raised from the earth in his mind, he is elevated
along with heaven, and will revolve with its revolution; studying ever
divine things, and their harmony with each other; from which Abraham
starting, ascended to the knowledge of Him who created them. Further,
the Gnostic will avail himself of dialectics, fixing on the distinction
of genera into species, and will master <span
id="fr_3325"></span>[3326](#fn_3325.md) the distinction of existences, till
he come to what are primary and simple.

<span id="vi.iv.vi.x-p3"></span>But the multitude are frightened at the
Hellenic philosophy, as children are at masks, being afraid lest it lead
them astray. But if the faith (for I cannot call it knowledge) which
they possess be such as to be dissolved by plausible speech, let it be
by all means dissolved, <span id="fr_3326"></span>[3327](#fn_3326.md) and
let them confess that they will not retain the truth. For truth is
immoveable; but false opinion dissolves. We choose, for instance, one
purple by comparison with another purple. So that, if one confesses that
he has not a heart that has been made right, he has not the table of the
money-changers or the test of words. <span
id="fr_3327"></span>[3328](#fn_3327.md) And how can he be any longer a
money-changer, who is not able to prove and distinguish spurious coin,
even offhand?

<span id="vi.iv.vi.x-p6"></span>Now David cried, “The righteous shall
not be shaken for ever;” <span id="fr_3328"></span>[3329](#fn_3328.md)
neither, consequently, by deceptive speech nor by erring pleasure. <span
id="page_499">p. 499</span> <span id="vi.iv.vi.x-Page_499"></span>Whence
he shall never be shaken from his own heritage. “He shall not be afraid
of evil tidings;” <span id="fr_3329"></span>[3330](#fn_3329.md)
consequently neither of unfounded calumny, nor of the false opinion
around him. No more will he dread cunning words, who is capable of
distinguishing them, or of answering rightly to questions asked. Such a
bulwark are dialectics, that truth cannot be trampled under foot by the
Sophists. “For it behoves those who praise in the holy name of the
Lord,” according to the prophet, “to rejoice in heart, seeking the Lord.
Seek then Him, and be strong. Seek His face continually in every
way.” <span id="fr_3330"></span>[3331](#fn_3330.md) “For, having spoken at
sundry times and in divers manners,” <span
id="fr_3331"></span>[3332](#fn_3331.md) it is not in one way only that He
is known.

<span id="vi.iv.vi.x-p11"></span>It is, then, not by availing himself of
these as virtues that our Gnostic will be deeply learned. But by using
them as helps in distinguishing what is common and what is peculiar, he
will admit the truth. For the cause of all error and false opinion, is
inability to distinguish in what respect things are common, and in what
respects they differ. For unless, in things that are distinct, one
closely watch speech, he will inadvertently confound what is common and
what is peculiar. And where this takes place, he must of necessity fall
into pathless tracts and error.

<span id="vi.iv.vi.x-p12"></span>The distinction of names and things
also in the Scriptures themselves produces great light in men’s souls.
For it is necessary to understand expressions which signify several
things, and several expressions when they signify one thing. The result
of which is accurate answering. But it is necessary to avoid the great
futility which occupies itself in irrelevant matters; since the Gnostic
avails himself of branches of learning as auxiliary preparatory
exercises, in order to the accurate communication of the truth, as far
as attainable and with as little distraction as possible, and for
defence against reasonings that plot for the extinction of the truth. He
will not then be deficient in what contributes to proficiency in the
curriculum of studies and the Hellenic philosophy; but not principally,
but necessarily, secondarily, and on account of circumstances. For what
those labouring in heresies use wickedly, the Gnostic will use rightly.

<span id="vi.iv.vi.x-p13"></span>Therefore the truth that appears in the
Hellenic philosophy, being partial, the real truth, like the sun
glancing on the colours both white and black, shows what like each of
them is. So also it exposes all sophistical plausibility. Rightly, then,
was it proclaimed also by the Greeks:—“Truth the queen is the beginning
of great virtue.” <span id="fr_3332"></span>[3333](#fn_3332.md)

id="vi.iv.vi.x-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.vi.x-p2"></span> Our choice lies between the reading of
the text, <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.vi.x-p2.1"></span>προσίσεται</span>; that of Hervetus, <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.iv.vi.x-p2.2"></span>προσοίσεται</span>; the
conjecture of Sylburgius, <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.vi.x-p2.3"></span>προσείσεται</span>, or <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.iv.vi.x-p2.4"></span>προσήσεται</span>, used
a little after in the phrase <span class="Greek"><span

<span id="vi.iv.vi.x-p4"></span> There is some difficulty in the
sentence as it stands. Hervetus omits in his translation the words
rendered here, “let it be by all means dissolved.” We have omitted <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.iv.vi.x-p4.1"></span>διὰ τούτους</span>,
which follows immediately after, but which is generally retained and
translated “by these,” i.e., philosophers.
