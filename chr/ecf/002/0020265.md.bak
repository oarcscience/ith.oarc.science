##### <span id="vi.iii.ii.i-p0.1"></span>Chap. I.—On Eating.

<span id="vi.iii.ii.i-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="vi.iii.ii.i-p1.1"></span>Keeping</span>, then, to our aim, and
selecting the Scriptures which bear on the usefulness of training for
life, we must now compendiously describe what the man who is called a
Christian ought to be during the whole of his life. We must accordingly
begin with ourselves, and how we ought to regulate ourselves. We have
therefore, preserving a due regard to the symmetry of this work, to say
how each of us ought to conduct himself in respect to his body, or
rather how to regulate the body itself. For whenever any one, who has
been brought away by the Word from external things, and from attention
to the body itself to the mind, acquires a clear view of what happens
according to nature in man, he will know that he is not to be earnestly
occupied about external things, but about what is proper and peculiar to
man—to purge the eye of the soul, and to sanctify also his flesh. For he
that is clean rid of those things which constitute him still dust, what
else has he more serviceable than himself for walking in the way which
leads to the comprehension of God.

<span id="vi.iii.ii.i-p2"></span>Some men, in truth, live that they may
eat, as the irrational creatures, “whose life is their belly, and
nothing else.” But the Instructor enjoins us to eat that we may live.
For neither is food our business, nor is pleasure our aim; but both are
on account of our life here, which the Word is training up to
immortality. Wherefore also there is discrimination to be employed in
reference to food. And it is to be simple, truly plain, suiting
precisely simple and artless children—as ministering to life, not to
luxury. And the life to which it conduces consists of two things—health
and strength; to which plainness of fare is most suitable, being
conducive both to digestion and lightness of body, from which come
growth, and health, and right strength, not strength that is wrong or
dangerous and wretched, as is that of athletes produced by compulsory
feeding.

<span id="vi.iii.ii.i-p3"></span>We must therefore reject different
varieties, which engender various mischiefs, such as a depraved habit of
body and disorders of the stomach, the taste being vitiated by an
unhappy art—that of cookery, and the useless art of making pastry. For
people dare to call by the name of food their dabbling in luxuries,
which glides into mischievous pleasures. Antiphanes, the Delian
physician, said that this variety of viands was the one cause of
disease; there being people who dislike the truth, and through various
absurd notions abjure moderation of diet, and put themselves to a world
of trouble to procure dainties from beyond seas.

<span id="vi.iii.ii.i-p4"></span>For my part, I am sorry for this
disease, while they are not ashamed to sing the praises of their
delicacies, giving themselves great trouble to get lampreys in the
Straits of Sicily, the eels of the Mæander, and the kids found in Melos,
and the mullets in Sciathus, and the mussels of Pelorus, the oysters of
Abydos, not omitting the sprats found in Lipara, and the Mantinican
turnip; and furthermore, the beetroot that grows among the Ascræans:
they seek out the cockles of Methymna, the turbots of Attica, and the
thrushes of Daphnis, and the reddish-brown dried figs, on account of
which the ill-starred Persian marched into Greece with five hundred
thousand men. Besides these, they purchase birds from Phasis, the
Egyptian snipes, and the Median peafowl. Altering these by means of
condiments, the gluttons gape for the sauces. “Whatever earth and the
depths of the sea, and the unmeasured space of the air produce,” they
cater for their gluttony. In their greed and solicitude, the gluttons
seem absolutely to sweep the world with a drag-net to gratify their
luxurious tastes. These gluttons, surrounded with the sound of hissing
frying-pans, and wearing their whole life away at the pestle and mortar,
cling to matter like fire. More than that, they emasculate plain food,
namely bread, by straining off the nourishing part of the grain, so that
<span id="page_238">p. 238</span> <span
id="vi.iii.ii.i-Page_238"></span>the necessary part of food becomes
matter of reproach to luxury. There is no limit to epicurism among men.
For it has driven them to sweetmeats, and honey-cakes, and sugar-plums;
inventing a multitude of desserts, hunting after all manner of dishes. A
man like this seems to me to be all jaw, and nothing else. “Desire not,”
says the Scripture, “rich men’s dainties;” <span
id="fr_1301"></span>[1302](#fn_1301.md) for they belong to a false and base
life. They partake of luxurious dishes, which a little after go to the
dunghill. But we who seek the heavenly bread must rule the belly, which
is beneath heaven, and much more the things which are agreeable to it,
which “God shall destroy,” <span id="fr_1302"></span>[1303](#fn_1302.md)
says the apostle, justly execrating gluttonous desires. For “meats are
for the belly,” <span id="fr_1303"></span>[1304](#fn_1303.md) for on them
depends this truly carnal and destructive life; whence <span
id="fr_1304"></span>[1305](#fn_1304.md) some, speaking with unbridled
tongue, dare to apply the name *agape*, <span
id="fr_1305"></span>[1306](#fn_1305.md) to pitiful suppers, redolent of
savour and sauces. Dishonouring the good and saving work of the Word,
the consecrated *agape*, with pots and pouring of sauce; and by drink
and delicacies and smoke desecrating that name, they are deceived in
their idea, having expected that the promise of God might be bought with
suppers. Gatherings for the sake of mirth, and such entertainments as
are called by ourselves, we name rightly suppers, dinners, and banquets,
after the example of the Lord. But such entertainments the Lord has not
called *agapæ*. He says accordingly somewhere, “When thou art called to
a wedding, recline not on the highest couch; but when thou art called,
fall into the lowest place;” <span id="fr_1306"></span>[1307](#fn_1306.md)
and elsewhere, “When thou makest a dinner or a supper;” and again, “But
when thou makest an entertainment, call the poor,” <span
id="fr_1307"></span>[1308](#fn_1307.md) for whose sake chiefly a supper
ought to be made. And further, “A certain man made a great supper, and
called many.” <span id="fr_1308"></span>[1309](#fn_1308.md) But I perceive
whence the specious appellation of suppers flowed: “from the gullets and
furious love for suppers”—according to the comic poet. For, in truth,
“to many, many things are on account of the supper.” For they have not
yet learned that God has provided for His creature (man I mean) food and
drink, for sustenance, not for pleasure; since the body derives no
advantage from extravagance in viands. For, quite the contrary, those
who use the most frugal fare are the strongest and the healthiest, and
the noblest; as domestics are healthier and stronger than their masters,
and husbandmen than the proprietors; and not only more robust, but
wiser, as philosophers are wiser than rich men. For they have not buried
the mind beneath food, nor deceived it with pleasures. But love
(*agape*) is in truth celestial food, the banquet of reason. “It beareth
all things, endureth all things, hopeth all things. Love never
faileth.” <span id="fr_1309"></span>[1310](#fn_1309.md) “Blessed is he who
shall eat bread in the kingdom of God.” <span
id="fr_1310"></span>[1311](#fn_1310.md) But the hardest of all cases is for
charity, which faileth not, to be cast from heaven above to the ground
into the midst of sauces. And do you imagine that I am thinking of a
supper that is to be done away with? “For if,” it is said, “I bestow all
my goods, and have not love, I am nothing.” <span
id="fr_1311"></span>[1312](#fn_1311.md) On this love alone depend the law
and the Word; and if “thou shalt love the Lord thy God and thy
neighbour,” this is the celestial festival in the heavens. But the
earthly is called a supper, as has been shown from Scripture. For the
supper is made for love, but the supper is not love (*agape*); only a
proof of mutual and reciprocal kindly feeling. “Let not, then, your good
be evil spoken of; for the kingdom of God is not meat and drink,” says
the apostle, in order that the meal spoken of may not be conceived as
ephemeral, “but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy
Ghost.” <span id="fr_1312"></span>[1313](#fn_1312.md) He who eats of this
meal, the best of all, shall possess the kingdom of God, fixing his
regards here on the holy assembly of love, the heavenly Church. Love,
then, is something pure and worthy of God, and its work is
communication. “And the care of discipline is love,” as Wisdom says;
“and love is the keeping of the law.” <span
id="fr_1313"></span>[1314](#fn_1313.md) And these joys have an inspiration
of love from the public nutriment, which accustoms to everlasting
dainties. Love (*agape*), then, is not a supper. But let the
entertainment depend on love. For it is said, “Let the children whom
Thou hast loved, O Lord, learn that it is not the products of fruits
that nourish man; but it is Thy word which preserves those who believe
on Thee.” <span id="fr_1314"></span>[1315](#fn_1314.md) “For the righteous
shall not live by bread.” <span id="fr_1315"></span>[1316](#fn_1315.md) But
let our diet be light and digestible, and suitable for keeping awake,
unmixed with diverse varieties. Nor is this a point which is beyond the
sphere of discipline. For love is a good nurse for communication; having
as its rich provision sufficiency, which, presiding over diet measured
in due quantity, and treating the body in a healthful way, distributes
something from its resources to those near us. But the diet which
exceeds sufficiency injures a man, deteriorates his spirit, and renders
his body prone to disease. Besides, those dainty tastes, <span
id="page_239">p. 239</span> <span id="vi.iii.ii.i-Page_239"></span>which
trouble themselves about rich dishes, drive to practices of ill-repute,
daintiness, gluttony, greed, voracity, insatiability. Appropriate
designations of such people as so indulge are flies, weasels,
flatterers, gladiators, and the monstrous tribes of parasites—the one
class surrendering reason, the other friendship, and the other life, for
the gratification of the belly; crawling on their bellies, beasts in
human shape after the image of their father, the voracious beast. People
first called the abandoned <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iii.ii.i-p19.3"></span>ἀσώτους</span>, and so appear to me to
indicate their end, understanding them as those who are (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.iii.ii.i-p19.4"></span>ἀσώστους</span>)
unsaved, excluding the <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iii.ii.i-p19.5"></span>σ</span>. For those that are absorbed in
pots, and exquisitely prepared niceties of condiments, are they not
plainly abject, earth-born, leading an ephemeral kind of life, as if
they were not to live \[hereafter\]? Those the Holy Spirit, by Isaiah,
denounces as wretched, depriving them tacitly of the name of love
(*agape*), since their feasting was not in accordance with the word.
“But they made mirth, killing calves, and sacrificing sheep, saying, Let
us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die.” And that He reckons such luxury
to be sin, is shown by what He adds, “And your sin shall not be forgiven
you till you die,” <span id="fr_1316"></span>[1317](#fn_1316.md) —not
conveying the idea that death, which deprives of sensation, is the
forgiveness of sin, but meaning that death of salvation which is the
recompense of sin. “Take no pleasure in abominable delicacies, says
Wisdom. <span id="fr_1317"></span>[1318](#fn_1317.md) At this point, too,
we have to advert to what are called things sacrificed to idols, in
order to show how we are enjoined to abstain from them. Polluted and
abominable those things seem to me, to the blood of which, fly

> <span id="vi.iii.ii.i-p21.2"></span> “Souls from Erebus of inanimate
> corpses.” <span id="fr_1318"></span>[1319](#fn_1318.md)  

<span id="vi.iii.ii.i-p23"></span>“For I would not that ye should have
fellowship with demons,” <span id="fr_1319"></span>[1320](#fn_1319.md) says
the apostle; since the food of those who are saved and those who perish
is separate. We must therefore abstain from these viands not for fear
(because there is no power in them); but on account of our conscience,
which is holy, and out of detestation of the demons to which they are
dedicated, are we to loathe them; and further, on account of the
instability of those who regard many things in a way that makes them
prone to fall, “whose conscience, being weak, is defiled: for meat
commendeth us not to God.” <span id="fr_1320"></span>[1321](#fn_1320.md)
“For it is not that which entereth in that defileth a man, but that
which goeth out of his mouth.” <span
id="fr_1321"></span>[1322](#fn_1321.md) The natural use of food is then
indifferent. “For neither if we eat are we the better,” it is said, “nor
if we eat not are we the worse.” <span
id="fr_1322"></span>[1323](#fn_1322.md) But it is inconsistent with reason,
for those that have been made worthy to share divine and spiritual food,
to partake of the tables of demons. “Have we not power to eat and to
drink,” says the apostle, “and to lead about wives”? But by keeping
pleasures under command we prevent lusts. See, then, that this power of
yours never “become a stumbling-block to the weak.”

<span id="vi.iii.ii.i-p28"></span>For it were not seemly that we, after
the fashion of the rich man’s son in the Gospel, <span
id="fr_1323"></span>[1324](#fn_1323.md) should, as prodigals, abuse the
Father’s gifts; but we should use them, without undue attachment to
them, as having command over ourselves. For we are enjoined to reign and
rule over meats, not to be slaves to them. It is an admirable thing,
therefore, to raise our eyes aloft to what is true, to depend on that
divine food above, and to satiate ourselves with the exhaustless
contemplation of that which truly exists, and so taste of the only sure
and pure delight. For such is the *agape*, which, the food that comes
from Christ shows that we ought to partake of. But totally irrational,
futile, and not human is it for those that are of the earth, fattening
themselves like cattle, to feed themselves up for death; looking
downwards on the earth, and bending ever over tables; leading a life of
gluttony; burying all the good of existence here in a life that by and
by will end; courting voracity alone, in respect to which cooks are held
in higher esteem than husbandmen. For we do not abolish social
intercourse, but look with suspicion on the snares of custom, and regard
them as a calamity. Wherefore daintiness is to be shunned, and we are to
partake of few and necessary things. “And if one of the unbelievers call
us to a feast, and we determine to go” (for it is a good thing not to
mix with the dissolute), the apostle bids us “eat what is set before us,
asking no questions for conscience sake.” <span
id="fr_1324"></span>[1325](#fn_1324.md) Similarly he has enjoined to
purchase “what is sold in the shambles,” without curious
questioning. <span id="fr_1325"></span>[1326](#fn_1325.md)

<span id="vi.iii.ii.i-p32"></span>We are not, then, to abstain wholly
from various kinds of food, but only are not to be taken up about them.
We are to partake of what is set before us, as becomes a Christian, out
of respect to him who has invited us, by a harmless and moderate
participation in the social meeting; regarding the sumptuousness of what
is put on the table as a matter of indifference, despising the dainties,
as after a little destined to perish. “Let him who eateth, not despise
him who eateth not; and let him who eateth not, not judge him who
eateth.” <span id="fr_1326"></span>[1327](#fn_1326.md) And a little way on
he explains the reason of the command, when <span id="page_240">p.
240</span> <span id="vi.iii.ii.i-Page_240"></span>he says, “He that
eateth, eateth to the Lord, and giveth God thanks; and he that eateth
not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.” <span
id="fr_1327"></span>[1328](#fn_1327.md) So that the right food is
thanksgiving. And he who gives thanks does not occupy his time in
pleasures. And if we would persuade any of our fellow-guests to virtue,
we are all the more on this account to abstain from those dainty dishes;
and so exhibit ourselves as a bright pattern of virtue, such as we
ourselves have in Christ. “For if any of such meats make a brother to
stumble, I shall not eat it as long as the world lasts,” says he, “that
I may not make my brother stumble.” <span
id="fr_1328"></span>[1329](#fn_1328.md) I gain the man by a little
self-restraint. “Have we not power to eat and to drink?” <span
id="fr_1329"></span>[1330](#fn_1329.md) And “we know”—he says the
truth—“that an idol is nothing in the world; but we have only one true
God, of whom are all things, and one Lord Jesus. But,” he says, “through
thy knowledge thy weak brother perishes, for whom Christ died; and they
that wound the conscience of the weak brethren sin against
Christ.” <span id="fr_1330"></span>[1331](#fn_1330.md) Thus the apostle, in
his solicitude for us, discriminates in the case of entertainments,
saying, that “if any one called a brother be found a fornicator, or an
adulterer, or an idolater, with such an one not to eat;” <span
id="fr_1331"></span>[1332](#fn_1331.md) neither in discourse or food are we
to join, looking with suspicion on the pollution thence proceeding, as
on the tables of the demons. “It is good, then, neither to eat flesh nor
to drink wine,” <span id="fr_1332"></span>[1333](#fn_1332.md) as both he
and the Pythagoreans acknowledge. For this is rather characteristic of a
beast; and the fumes arising from them being dense, darken the soul. If
one partakes of them, he does not sin. Only let him partake temperately,
not dependent on them, nor gaping after fine fare. For a voice will
whisper to him, saying, “Destroy not the work of God for the sake of
food.” <span id="fr_1333"></span>[1334](#fn_1333.md) For it is the mark of
a silly mind to be amazed and stupefied at what is presented at vulgar
banquets, after the rich fare which is in the Word; and much sillier to
make one’s eyes the slaves of the delicacies, so that one’s greed is, so
to speak, carried round by the servants. And how foolish for people to
raise themselves on the couches, all but pitching their faces into the
dishes, stretching out from the couch as from a nest, according to the
common saying, “that they may catch the wandering steam by breathing it
in!” And how senseless, to besmear their hands with the condiments, and
to be constantly reaching to the sauce, cramming themselves immoderately
and shamelessly, not like people tasting, but ravenously seizing! For
you may see such people, liker swine or dogs for gluttony than men, in
such a hurry to feed themselves full, that both jaws are stuffed out at
once, the veins about the face raised, and besides, the perspiration
running all over, as they are tightened with their insatiable greed, and
panting with their excess; the food pushed with unsocial eagerness into
their stomach, as if they were stowing away their victuals for provision
for a journey, not for digestion. Excess, which in all things is an
evil, is very highly reprehensible in the matter of food. Gluttony,
called <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iii.ii.i-p40.2"></span>ὀψοφαγία</span>, is nothing but excess in
the use of relishes (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iii.ii.i-p40.3"></span>ὄψον</span>); and <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.iii.ii.i-p40.4"></span>λαιμαργία</span> is
insanity with respect to the gullet; and <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iii.ii.i-p40.5"></span>γαστριμαργία</span> is excess with respect
to food—insanity in reference to the belly, as the name implies; for
<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.iii.ii.i-p40.6"></span>μάργος</span> is
a madman. The apostle, checking those that transgress in their conduct
at entertainments, <span id="fr_1334"></span>[1335](#fn_1334.md) says: “For
every one taketh beforehand in eating his own supper; and one is hungry,
and another drunken. Have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? Or
despise ye the church of God, and shame those who have not?” <span
id="fr_1335"></span>[1336](#fn_1335.md) And among those who have, they, who
eat shamelessly and are insatiable, shame themselves. And both act
badly; the one by paining those who have not, the other by exposing
their own greed in the presence of those who have. Necessarily,
therefore, against those who have cast off shame and unsparingly abuse
meals, the insatiable to whom nothing is sufficient, the apostle, in
continuation, again breaks forth in a voice of displeasure: “So that, my
brethren, when ye come together to eat, wait for one another. And if any
one is hungry, let him eat at home, that ye come not together to
condemnation.” <span id="fr_1336"></span>[1337](#fn_1336.md)

<span id="vi.iii.ii.i-p44"></span>From all slavish habits <span
id="fr_1337"></span>[1338](#fn_1337.md) and excess we must abstain, and
touch what is set before us in a decorous way; keeping the hand and
couch and chin free of stains; preserving the grace of the countenance
undisturbed, and committing no indecorum in the act of swallowing; but
stretching out the hand at intervals in an orderly manner. We must guard
against speaking anything while eating: for the voice becomes
disagreeable and inarticulate when it is confined by full jaws; and the
tongue, pressed by the food and impeded in its natural energy, gives
forth a compressed utterance. Nor is it suitable to eat and to drink
simultaneously. For it is the very extreme of intemperance to confound
the times whose uses are discordant. And “whether ye eat or drink, do
all to the glory of God,” <span id="fr_1338"></span>[1339](#fn_1338.md)
aiming after true frugality, which the Lord also seems to me to have
hinted at when He blessed <span id="page_241">p. 241</span> <span
id="vi.iii.ii.i-Page_241"></span>the loaves and the cooked fishes with
which He feasted the disciples, introducing a beautiful example of
simple food. That fish then which, at the command of the Lord, Peter
caught, points to digestible and God-given and moderate food. And by
those who rise from the water to the bait of righteousness, He
admonishes us to take away luxury and avarice, as the coin from the
fish; in order that He might displace vainglory; and by giving the
stater to the tax-gatherers, and “rendering to Cæsar the things which
are Cæsar’s,” might preserve “to God the things which are God’s.” <span
id="fr_1339"></span>[1340](#fn_1339.md) The stater is capable of other
explanations not unknown to us, but the present is not a suitable
occasion for their treatment. Let the mention we make for our present
purpose suffice, as it is not unsuitable to the flowers of the Word; and
we have often done this, drawing to the urgent point of the question the
most beneficial fountain, in order to water those who have been planted
by the Word. “For if it is lawful for me to partake of all things, yet
all things are not expedient.” <span
id="fr_1340"></span>[1341](#fn_1340.md) For those that do all that is
lawful, quickly fall into doing what is unlawful. And just as
righteousness is not attained by avarice, nor temperance by excess; so
neither is the regimen of a Christian formed by indulgence; for the
table of truth is far from lascivious dainties. For though it was
chiefly for men’s sake that all things were made, yet it is not good to
use all things, nor at all times. For the occasion, and the time, and
the mode, and the intention, materially turn the balance with reference
to what is useful, in the view of one who is rightly instructed; and
this is suitable, and has influence in putting a stop to a life of
gluttony, which wealth is prone to choose, not that wealth which sees
clearly, but that abundance which makes a man blind with reference to
gluttony. No one is poor as regards necessaries, and a man is never
overlooked. For there is one God who feeds the fowls and the fishes,
and, in a word, the irrational creatures; and not one thing whatever is
wanting to them, though “they take no thought for their food.” <span
id="fr_1341"></span>[1342](#fn_1341.md) And we are better than they, being
their lords, and more closely allied to God, as being wiser; and we were
made, not that we might eat and drink, but that we might devote
ourselves to the knowledge of God. “For the just man who eats is
satisfied in his soul, but the belly of the wicked shall want,” <span
id="fr_1342"></span>[1343](#fn_1342.md) filled with the appetites of
insatiable gluttony. Now lavish expense is adapted not for enjoyment
alone, but also for social communication. Wherefore we must guard
against those articles of food which persuade us to eat when we are not
hungry, bewitching the appetite. For is there not within a temperate
simplicity a wholesome variety of eatables? Bulbs, <span
id="fr_1343"></span>[1344](#fn_1343.md) olives, certain herbs, milk,
cheese, fruits, all kinds of cooked food without sauces; and if flesh is
wanted, let roast rather than boiled be set down. Have you anything to
eat here? said the Lord <span id="fr_1344"></span>[1345](#fn_1344.md) to
the disciples after the resurrection; and they, as taught by Him to
practice frugality, “gave Him a piece of broiled fish;” and having eaten
before them, says Luke, He spoke to them what He spoke. And in addition
to these, it is not to be overlooked that those who feed according to
the Word are not debarred from dainties in the shape of honey-combs. For
of articles of food, those are the most suitable which are fit for
immediate use without fire, since they are readiest; and second to these
are those which are simplest, as we said before. But those who bend
around inflammatory tables, nourishing their own diseases, are ruled by
a most lickerish demon, whom I shall not blush to call the Belly-demon,
and the worst and most abandoned of demons. He is therefore exactly like
the one who is called the Ventriloquist-demon. It is far better to be
happy <span id="fr_1345"></span>[1346](#fn_1345.md) than to have a demon
dwelling with us. And happiness is found in the practice of virtue.
Accordingly, the apostle Matthew partook of seeds, and nuts, <span
id="fr_1346"></span>[1347](#fn_1346.md) and vegetables, without flesh. And
John, who carried temperance to the extreme, “ate locusts and wild
honey.” Peter abstained from swine; “but a trance fell on him,” as is
written in the Acts of the Apostles, “and he saw heaven opened, and a
vessel let down on the earth by the four corners, and all the
four-looted beasts and creeping things of the earth and the fowls of
heaven in it; and there came a voice to him, Rise, and slay, and eat.
And Peter said, Not so, Lord, for I have never eaten what is common or
unclean. And the voice came again to him the second time, What God hath
cleansed, call not thou common.” <span
id="fr_1347"></span>[1348](#fn_1347.md) The use of them is accordingly
indifferent to us. “For not what entereth into the mouth defileth the
man,” <span id="fr_1348"></span>[1349](#fn_1348.md) but the vain opinion
respecting uncleanness. For God, when He created man, said, “All things
shall be to you for meat.” <span id="fr_1349"></span>[1350](#fn_1349.md)
“And herbs, with love, are better than a calf with fraud.” <span
id="fr_1350"></span>[1351](#fn_1350.md) This well reminds us of what was
said above, that herbs are not love, but that our meals are to be taken
with love; <span id="fr_1351"></span>[1352](#fn_1351.md) and in these the
medium state is <span id="page_242">p. 242</span> <span
id="vi.iii.ii.i-Page_242"></span>good. In all things, indeed, this is
the case, and not least in the preparation made for feasting, since the
extremes are dangerous, and middle courses good. And to be in no want of
necessaries is the medium. For the desires which are in accordance with
nature are bounded by sufficiency. The Jews had frugality enjoined on
them by the law in the most systematic manner. For the Instructor, by
Moses, deprived them of the use of innumerable things, adding
reasons—the spiritual ones hidden; the carnal ones apparent, to which
indeed they have trusted; in the case of some animals, because they did
not part the hoof, and others because they did not ruminate their food,
and others because alone of aquatic animals they were devoid of scales;
so that altogether but a few were left appropriate for their food. And
of those that he permitted them to touch, he prohibited such as had
died, or were offered to idols, or had been strangled; for to touch
these was unlawful. For since it is impossible for those who use
dainties to abstain from partaking of them, he appointed the opposite
mode of life, till he should break down the propensity to indulgence
arising from habit. Pleasure has often produced in men harm and pain;
and full feeding begets in the soul uneasiness, and forgetfulness, and
foolishness. And they say that the bodies of children, when shooting up
to their height, are made to grow right by deficiency in nourishment.
For then the spirit, which pervades the body in order to its growth, is
not checked by abundance of food obstructing the freedom of its course.
Whence that truth-seeking philosopher Plato, fanning the spark of the
Hebrew philosophy when condemning a life of luxury, says: “On my coming
hither, the life which is here called happy, full of Italian and
Syracusan tables, pleased me not by any means, \[consisting as it did\]
in being filled twice a day, and never sleeping by night alone, and
whatever other accessories attend the mode of life. For not one man
under heaven, if brought up from his youth in such practices, will ever
turn out a wise man, with however admirable a natural genius he may be
endowed.” For Plato was not unacquainted with David, who “placed the
sacred ark in his city in the midst of the tabernacle;” and bidding all
his subjects rejoice “before the Lord, divided to the whole host of
Israel, man and woman, to each a loaf of bread, and baked bread, and a
cake from the frying-pan.” <span id="fr_1352"></span>[1353](#fn_1352.md)

<span id="vi.iii.ii.i-p61"></span>This was the sufficient sustenance of
the Israelites. But that of the Gentiles was over-abundant. No one who
uses it will ever study to become temperate, burying as he does his mind
in his belly, very like the fish called ass, <span
id="fr_1353"></span>[1354](#fn_1353.md) which, Aristotle says, alone of all
creatures has its heart in its stomach. This fish Epicharmus the comic
poet calls “monster-paunch.”

<span id="vi.iii.ii.i-p63"></span>Such are the men who believe in their
belly, “whose God is their belly, whose glory is in their shame, who
mind earthly things.” To them the apostle predicted no good when he
said, “whose end is destruction.” <span
