##### <span id="vi.ii.ix-p0.1"></span>Chapter IX.—“That Those Grievously Sin Who Despise or Neglect God’s Gracious Calling.”

<span id="vi.ii.ix-p1"></span>I could adduce ten thousand Scriptures of
which not “one tittle shall pass away,” <span
id="fr_956"></span>[957](#fn_956.md) without being fulfilled; for the mouth
of the Lord the Holy Spirit hath spoken these things. “Do not any
longer,” he says, “my son, despise the chastening of the <span
class="sc"><span id="vi.ii.ix-p2.2"></span>Lord</span>, nor faint when
thou art rebuked of Him.” <span id="fr_957"></span>[958](#fn_957.md) O
surpassing love for man! Not as a teacher speaking to his pupils, not as
a master to his domestics, nor as God to men, but as a father, does the
Lord gently admonish his children. Thus Moses confesses that “he was
filled with quaking and terror” <span id="fr_958"></span>[959](#fn_958.md)
while he listened to God speaking concerning the Word. And art not thou
afraid as thou hearest the voice of the Divine Word? Art not thou
distressed? Do you not fear, and hasten to learn of Him,—that is, to
salvation,—dreading wrath, loving grace, eagerly striving after the hope
set before us, that you may shun the judgment threatened? Come, come, O
my young people! For if you become not again as little children, and be
born again, as saith the Scripture, you shall not receive the truly
existent Father, nor shall you ever enter into the kingdom of heaven.
For in what way is a stranger permitted to enter? Well, as I take it,
then, when he is enrolled and made a citizen, and receives one to stand
to him in the relation of father, then will he be occupied with the
Father’s concerns, then shall he be deemed worthy to be made His heir,
then will he share the kingdom of the Father with His own dear Son. For
this is the first-born Church, composed of many good children; these are
“the first-born enrolled in heaven, who hold high festival with so many
myriads of angels.” We, too, are first-born sons, who are reared by God,
who are the genuine friends of the First-born, who first of all other
men attained to the knowledge of God, who first were wrenched away from
our sins, first severed from the devil. And now the more benevolent God
is, the more impious men are; for He desires us from slaves to become
sons, while they scorn to become sons. O the prodigious folly of being
ashamed of the Lord! He offers freedom, you flee into bondage; He
bestows salvation, you sink down into destruction; He confers
everlasting life, you wait for punishment, and prefer the fire which the
Lord “has prepared for the devil and his angels.” <span
id="fr_959"></span>[960](#fn_959.md) Wherefore the blessed apostle says: “I
testify in the Lord, that ye walk no longer as the Gentiles walk, in the
vanity of their mind; having their understanding darkened, being
alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them,
because of the hardness of their heart: who, being past feeling, have
given themselves over to lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness and
concupiscence.” <span id="fr_960"></span>[961](#fn_960.md) After the
accusation of such a witness, and his invocation of God, what else
remains for the unbelieving than judgment and condemnation? And the
Lord, with ceaseless assiduity, exhorts, terrifies, urges, rouses, <span
id="page_196">p. 196</span> <span
id="vi.ii.ix-Page_196"></span>admonishes; He awakes from the sleep of
darkness, and raises up those who have wandered in error. “Awake,” He
says, “thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall
give thee light,” <span id="fr_961"></span>[962](#fn_961.md) —Christ, the
Sun of the Resurrection, He “who was born before the morning
star,” <span id="fr_962"></span>[963](#fn_962.md) and with His beams
bestows life. Let no one then despise the Word, lest he unwittingly
despise himself. For the Scripture somewhere says, “To-day, if ye will
hear His voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the
day of temptation in the wilderness, when your fathers proved Me by
trial.” <span id="fr_963"></span>[964](#fn_963.md) And what was the trial?
If you wish to learn, the Holy Spirit will show you: “And saw my works,”
He says, “forty years. Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and
said, They do always err in heart, and have not known My ways. So I
sware in my wrath, they shall not enter into My rest.” <span
id="fr_964"></span>[965](#fn_964.md) Look to the threatening! Look to the
exhortation! Look to the punishment! Why, then, should we any longer
change grace into wrath, and not receive the word with open ears, and
entertain God as a guest in pure spirits? For great is the grace of His
promise, “if to-day we hear His voice.” <span
id="fr_965"></span>[966](#fn_965.md) And that to-day is lengthened out day
by day, while it is called to-day. And to the end the to-day and the
instruction continue; and then the true to-day, the never-ending day of
God, extends over eternity. Let us then ever obey the voice of the
divine word. For the to-day signifies eternity. And day is the symbol of
light; and the light of men is the Word, by whom we behold God. Rightly,
then, to those that have believed and obey, grace will superabound;
while with those that have been unbelieving, and err in heart, and have
not known the Lord’s ways, which John commanded to make straight and to
prepare, God is incensed, and those He threatens.

<span id="vi.ii.ix-p12"></span>And, indeed, the old Hebrew wanderers in
the desert received typically the end of the threatening; for they are
said not to have entered into the rest, because of unbelief, till,
having followed the successor of Moses, they learned by experience,
though late, that they could not be saved otherwise than by believing on
Jesus. But the Lord, in His love to man, invites all men to the
knowledge of the truth, and for this end sends the Paraclete. What,
then, is this knowledge? Godliness; and “godliness,” according to Paul,
“is profitable for all things, having the promise of the life that now
is, and of that which is to come.” <span
id="fr_966"></span>[967](#fn_966.md) If eternal salvation were to be sold,
for how much, O men, would you propose to purchase it? Were one to
estimate the value of the whole of Pactolus, the fabulous river of gold,
he would not have reckoned up a price equivalent to salvation.

<span id="vi.ii.ix-p14"></span>Do not, however, faint. You may, if you
choose, purchase salvation, though of inestimable value, with your own
resources, love and living faith, which will be reckoned a suitable
price. This recompense God cheerfully accepts; “for we trust in the
living God, who is the Saviour of all men, especially of those who
believe.” <span id="fr_967"></span>[968](#fn_967.md)

<span id="vi.ii.ix-p16"></span>But the rest, round whom the world’s
growths have fastened, as the rocks on the sea-shore are covered over
with sea-weed, make light of immortality, like the old man of Ithaca,
eagerly longing to see, not the truth, not the fatherland in heaven, not
the true light, but smoke. But godliness, that makes man as far as can
be like God, designates God as our suitable teacher, who alone can
worthily assimilate man to God. This teaching the apostle knows as truly
divine. “Thou, O Timothy,” he says, “from a child hast known the holy
letters, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation, through faith
that is in Christ Jesus.” <span id="fr_968"></span>[969](#fn_968.md) For
truly holy are those letters that sanctify and deify; and the writings
or volumes that consist of those holy letters and syllables, the same
apostle consequently calls “inspired of God, being profitable for
doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness,
that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished to every good
work.” <span id="fr_969"></span>[970](#fn_969.md) No one will be so
impressed by the exhortations of any of the saints, as he is by the
words of the Lord Himself, the lover of man. For this, and nothing but
this, is His only work—the salvation of man. Therefore He Himself,
urging them on to salvation, cries, “The kingdom of heaven is at
hand.” <span id="fr_970"></span>[971](#fn_970.md) Those men that draw near
through fear, He converts. Thus also the apostle of the Lord, beseeching
the Macedonians, becomes the interpreter of the divine voice, when he
says, “The Lord is at hand; take care that ye be not apprehended
empty.” <span id="fr_971"></span>[972](#fn_971.md) But are ye so devoid of
fear, or rather of faith, as not to believe the Lord Himself, or Paul,
who in Christ’s stead thus entreats: “Taste and see that Christ is
God?” <span id="fr_972"></span>[973](#fn_972.md) Faith will lead you in;
experience will teach you; Scripture will train you, for it says, “Come
hither, O children; listen to me, and I will teach you the fear of the
<span class="sc"><span id="vi.ii.ix-p21.4"></span>Lord</span>.” Then, as
to those who already believe, it briefly adds, “What man is he that
desireth life, that loveth to see good days?” <span
id="fr_973"></span>[974](#fn_973.md) It is we, we shall <span
id="page_197">p. 197</span> <span id="vi.ii.ix-Page_197"></span> say—we
who are the devotees of good, we who eagerly desire good things. Hear,
then, ye who are far off, hear ye who are near: the word has not been
hidden from any; light is common, it shines “on all men.” No one is a
Cimmerian in respect to the word. Let us haste to salvation, to
regeneration; let us who are many haste that we may be brought together
into one love, according to the union of the essential unity; and let
us, by being made good, conformably follow after union, seeking after
the good Monad.

<span id="vi.ii.ix-p23"></span>The union of many in one, issuing in the
production of divine harmony out of a medley of sounds and division,
becomes one symphony following one choir-leader and teacher, <span
id="fr_974"></span>[975](#fn_974.md) the Word, reaching and resting in the
same truth, and crying Abba, Father. This, the true utterance of His
children, God accepts with gracious welcome—the first-fruits He receives
from them.
