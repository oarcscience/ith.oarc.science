##### <span id="iv.ii.iii.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.—How Autolycus Had Been Misled by False Accusations Against the Christians.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.iv-p1"></span>Nor indeed was there any necessity for
my refuting these, except that I see you still in dubiety about the word
of the truth. For though yourself prudent, you endure fools gladly.
Otherwise you would not have been moved by senseless men to yield
yourself to empty words, and to give credit to the prevalent rumor
wherewith godless lips falsely accuse us, who are worshippers of God,
and are called Christians, alleging that the wives of us all are held in
common and made promiscuous use of; and that we even commit incest with
our own sisters, and, what is most impious and barbarous of all, that we
eat human flesh. <span id="fr_639"></span>[640](#fn_639.md) But further,
they say that our doctrine has but recently come to light, and that we
have nothing to allege in proof of what we receive as truth, nor of our
teaching, but that our doctrine is foolishness. I wonder, then, chiefly
that you, who in other matters are studious, and a scrutinizer of all
things, give but a careless hearing to us. For, if it were possible for
you, you would not grudge to spend the night in the libraries.

If, then, it had been the primitive doctrine, that the bread and wine
cease to exist in the Eucharist, and are changed into natural flesh and
blood, our author could not have resented this charge as “most barbarous
and impious.”\]
