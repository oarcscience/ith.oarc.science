##### <span id="vi.iv.ii.xiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIV.—How a Thing May Be Involuntary.

<span id="vi.iv.ii.xiv-p1"></span>What is involuntary is not matter for
judgment. But this is twofold,—what is done in ignorance, and what is
done through necessity. For how will you judge concerning those who are
said to sin in involuntary modes? For either one knew not himself, as
Cleomenes and Athamas, who were mad; or the thing which he does, as
Æschylus, who divulged the mysteries on the stage, who, being tried in
the Areopagus, was absolved on his showing that he had not been
initiated. Or one knows not what is done, as he who has let off his
antagonist, and slain his domestic instead of his enemy; or that by
which it is done, as he who, in exercising with spears having buttons on
them, has killed some one in consequence of the spear throwing off the
button; or knows not the manner how, as he who has killed his antagonist
in the stadium, for it was not for his death but for victory that he
contended; or knows not the reason why it is done, as the physician gave
a salutary antidote and killed, for it was not for this purpose that he
gave it, but to save. The law at that time punished him who had killed
involuntarily, as e.g., him who was subject involuntarily to gonorrhœa,
but not equally with him who did so voluntarily. Although he also shall
be punished as for a voluntary action, if one transfer the affection to
the truth. For, in reality, he that cannot contain the generative word
is to be punished; for this is an irrational passion of the soul
approaching garrulity. “The faithful man chooses to conceal things in
his spirit.” <span id="fr_2288"></span>[2289](#fn_2288) Things, then,
that depend on choice are subjects for judgment. “For the Lord searcheth
the hearts and reins.” <span id="fr_2289"></span>[2290](#fn_2289) “And
he that looketh so as to lust” <span
id="fr_2290"></span>[2291](#fn_2290) is judged. Wherefore it is said,
“Thou shalt not lust.” <span id="fr_2291"></span>[2292](#fn_2291) And
“this people honoureth Me with their lips,” it is said, “but their heart
is far from Me.” <span id="fr_2292"></span>[2293](#fn_2292) For God has
respect to the very thought, since Lot’s wife, who had merely
voluntarily turned towards worldly wickedness, He left a senseless mass,
rendering her a pillar of salt, and fixed her so that she advanced no
further, not as a stupid and useless image, but to season and salt him
who has the power of spiritual perception.
