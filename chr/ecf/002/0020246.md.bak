##### <span id="vi.ii.x-p0.1"></span>Chapter X.—Answer to the Objection of the Heathen, that It Was Not Right to Abandon the Customs of Their Fathers.

<span id="vi.ii.x-p1"></span>But you say it is not creditable to subvert
the customs handed down to us from our fathers. And why, then, do we not
still use our first nourishment, milk, to which our nurses accustomed us
from the time of our birth? Why do we increase or diminish our
patrimony, and not keep it exactly the same as we got it? Why do we not
still vomit on our parents’ breasts, or still do the things for which,
when infants, and nursed by our mothers, we were laughed at, but have
corrected ourselves, even if we did not fall in with good instructors?
Then, if excesses in the indulgence of the passions, though pernicious
and dangerous, yet are accompanied with pleasure, why do we not in the
conduct of life abandon that usage which is evil, and provocative of
passion, and godless, even should our fathers feel hurt, and betake
ourselves to the truth, and seek Him who is truly our Father, rejecting
custom as a deleterious drug? For of all that I have undertaken to do,
the task I now attempt is the noblest, viz., to demonstrate to you how
inimical this insane and most wretched custom is to godliness. For a
boon so great, the greatest ever given by God to the human race, would
never have been hated and rejected, had not you been carried away by
custom, and then shut your ears against us; and just as unmanageable
horses throw off the reins, and take the bit between their teeth, you
rush away from the arguments addressed to you, in your eager desire to
shake yourselves clear of us, who seek to guide the chariot of your
life, and, impelled by your folly, dash towards the precipices of
destruction, and regard the holy word of God as an accursed thing. The
reward of your choice, therefore, as described by Sophocles, follows:—

> <span id="vi.ii.x-p1.1"></span> “The mind a blank, useless ears, vain
> thoughts.”  

<span id="vi.ii.x-p2"></span>And you know not that, of all truths, this
is the truest, that the good and godly shall obtain the good reward,
inasmuch as they held goodness in high esteem; while, on the other hand,
the wicked shall receive meet punishment. For the author of evil,
torment has been prepared; and so the prophet Zecharias threatens him:
“He that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee; lo, is not this a brand
plucked from the fire?” <span id="fr_975"></span>[976](#fn_975.md) What an
infatuated desire, then, for voluntary death is this, rooted in men’s
minds! Why do they flee to this fatal brand, with which they shall be
burned, when it is within their power to live nobly according to God,
and not according to custom? For God bestows life freely; but evil
custom, after our departure from this world, brings on the sinner
unavailing remorse with punishment. *By sad experience, even a child
knows* how superstition destroys and piety saves. Let any of you look at
those who minister before the idols, their hair matted, their persons
disgraced with filthy and tattered clothes; who never come near a bath,
and let their nails grow to an extraordinary length, like wild beasts;
many of them castrated, who show the idol’s temples to be in reality
graves or prisons. These appear to me to bewail the gods, not to worship
them, and their sufferings to be worthy of pity rather than piety. And
seeing these things, do you still continue blind, and will you not look
up to the Ruler of all, the Lord of the universe? And will you not
escape from those dungeons, and flee to the mercy that comes down from
heaven? For God, of His great love to man, comes to the help of man, as
the mother-bird flies to one of her young that has fallen out of the
nest; and if a serpent open its mouth to swallow the little bird, “the
mother flutters round, uttering cries of grief over her dear
progeny;” <span id="fr_976"></span>[977](#fn_976.md) and God the Father
seeks His creature, and heals his transgression, and pursues the
serpent, and recovers the young one, and incites it to fly up to the
nest.

<span id="vi.ii.x-p5"></span>Thus dogs that have strayed, track out
their master by the scent; and horses that have thrown their riders,
come to their master’s call if he but whistle. “The ox,” it is said,
“knoweth his owner, and the ass his master’s crib; but Israel hath not
known Me.” <span id="fr_977"></span>[978](#fn_977.md) What, then, of the
Lord? He remembers not our ill desert; He still pities, He still urges
us to repentance.

<span id="page_198">p. 198</span> <span id="vi.ii.x-Page_198"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.x-p7"></span>And I would ask you, if it does not appear
to you monstrous, that you men who are God’s handiwork, who have
received your souls from Him, and belong wholly to God, should be
subject to another master, and, what is more, serve the tyrant instead
of the rightful King—the evil one instead of the good? For, in the name
of truth, what man in his senses turns his back on good, and attaches
himself to evil? What, then, is he who flees from God to consort with
demons? Who, that may become a son of God, prefers to be in bondage? Or
who is he that pursues his way to Erebus, when it is in his power to be
a citizen of heaven, and to cultivate Paradise, and walk about in heaven
and partake of the tree of life and immortality, and, cleaving his way
through the sky in the track of the luminous cloud, behold, like Elias,
the rain of salvation? Some there are, who, like worms wallowing in
marshes and mud in the streams of pleasure, feed on foolish and useless
delights—swinish men. For swine, it is said, like mud better than pure
water; and, according to Democritus, “doat upon dirt.”

<span id="vi.ii.x-p8"></span>Let us not then be enslaved or become
swinish; but, as true children of the light, let us raise our eyes and
look on the light, lest the Lord discover us to be spurious, as the sun
does the eagles. Let us therefore repent, and pass from ignorance to
knowledge, from foolishness to wisdom, from licentiousness to
self-restraint, from unrighteousness to righteousness, from godlessness
to God. It is an enterprise of noble daring to take our way to God; and
the enjoyment of many other good things is within the reach of the
lovers of righteousness, who pursue eternal life, specially those things
to which God Himself alludes, speaking by Isaiah: “There is an
inheritance for those who serve the <span class="sc"><span
id="vi.ii.x-p8.1"></span>Lord</span>.” <span
id="fr_978"></span>[979](#fn_978.md) Noble and desirable is this
inheritance: not gold, not silver, not raiment, which the moth assails,
and things of earth which are assailed by the robber, whose eye is
dazzled by worldly wealth; but it is that treasure of salvation to which
we must hasten, by becoming lovers of the Word. Thence praise-worthy
works descend to us, and fly with us on the wing of truth. This is the
inheritance with which the eternal covenant of God invests us, conveying
the everlasting gift of grace; and thus our loving Father—the true
Father—ceases not to exhort, admonish, train, love us. For He ceases not
to save, and advises the best course: “Become righteous,” says the
Lord. <span id="fr_979"></span>[980](#fn_979.md) Ye that thirst, come to
the water; and ye that have no money, come, and buy and drink without
money. <span id="fr_980"></span>[981](#fn_980.md) He invites to the laver,
to salvation, to illumination, all but crying out and saying, The land I
give thee, and the sea, my child, and heaven too; and all the living
creatures in them I freely bestow upon thee. Only, O child, thirst for
thy Father; God shall be revealed to thee without price; the truth is
not made merchandise of. He gives thee all creatures that fly and swim,
and those on the land. These the Father has created for thy thankful
enjoyment. What the bastard, who is a son of perdition, foredoomed to be
the slave of mammon, has to buy for money, He assigns to thee as thine
own, even to His own son who loves the Father; for whose sake He still
works, and to whom alone He promises, saying, “The land shall not be
sold in perpetuity,” for it is not destined to corruption. “For the
whole land is mine;” and it is thine too, if thou receive God. Wherefore
the Scripture, as might have been expected, proclaims good news to those
who have believed. “The saints of the Lord shall inherit the glory of
God and His power.” What glory, tell me, O blessed One, which “eye hath
not seen, nor ear heard, nor hath it entered into the heart of
man;” <span id="fr_981"></span>[982](#fn_981.md) and “they shall be glad in
the kingdom of their Lord for ever and ever! Amen.” You have, O men, the
divine promise of grace; you have heard, on the other hand, the
threatening of punishment: by these the Lord saves, teaching men by fear
and grace. Why do we delay? Why do we not shun the punishment? Why do we
not receive the free gift? Why, in fine, do we not choose the better
part, God instead of the evil one, and prefer wisdom to idolatry, and
take life in exchange for death? “Behold,” He says, “I have set before
your face death and life.” <span id="fr_982"></span>[983](#fn_982.md) The
Lord tries you, that “you may choose life.” He counsels you as a father
to obey God. “For if ye hear Me,” He says, “and be willing, ye shall eat
the good things of the land:” <span id="fr_983"></span>[984](#fn_983.md)
this is the grace attached to obedience. “But if ye obey Me not, and are
unwilling, the sword and fire shall devour you:” <span
id="fr_984"></span>[985](#fn_984.md) this is the penalty of disobedience.
For the mouth of the Lord—the law of truth, the word of the Lord—hath
spoken these things. Are you willing that I should be your good
counsellor? Well, do you hear. I, if possible, will explain. You ought,
O men, when reflecting on the Good, to have brought forward a witness
inborn and competent, viz., faith, which of itself, and from its own
resources, chooses at once what is best, instead of occupying yourselves
in painfully inquiring whether what is best ought to be followed. For,
allow me to tell you, you ought to doubt whether you should get drunk,
but you get drunk before reflecting on the matter; and whether <span
id="page_199">p. 199</span> <span id="vi.ii.x-Page_199"></span>you ought
to do an injury, but you do injury with the utmost readiness. The only
thing you make the subject of question is, whether God should be
worshipped, and whether this wise God and Christ should be followed: and
this you think requires deliberation and doubt, and know not what is
worthy of God. Have faith in us, as you have in drunkenness, that you
may be wise; have faith in us, as you have in injury, that you may live.
But if, acknowledging the conspicuous trustworthiness of the virtues,
you wish to trust them, come and I will set before you in abundance,
materials of persuasion respecting the Word. But do you—for your
ancestral customs, by which your minds are preoccupied, divert you from
the truth,—do you now hear what is the real state of the case as
follows.

<span id="vi.ii.x-p16"></span>And let not any shame of this name
preoccupy you, which does great harm to men, and seduces them from
salvation. Let us then openly strip for the contest, and nobly strive in
the arena of truth, the holy Word being the judge, and the Lord of the
universe prescribing the contest. For ’tis no insignificant prize, the
guerdon of immortality which is set before us. Pay no more regard, then,
if you are rated by some of the low rabble who lead the dance of
impiety, and are driven on to the same pit by their folly and insanity,
makers of idols and worshippers of stones. For these have dared to deify
men,—Alexander of Macedon, for example, whom they canonized as the
thirteenth god, whose pretensions Babylon confuted, which showed him
dead. I admire, therefore, the divine sophist. Theocritus was his name.
After Alexander’s death, Theocritus, holding up the vain opinions
entertained by men respecting the gods, to ridicule before his
fellow-citizens, said: “Men, keep up your hearts as long as you see the
gods dying sooner than men.” And, truly, he who worships gods that are
visible, and the promiscuous rabble of creatures begotten and born, and
attaches himself to them, is a far more wretched object than the very
demons. For God is by no manner of means unrighteous, as the demons are,
but in the very highest degree righteous; and nothing more resembles God
than one of us when he becomes righteous in the highest possible
degree:—

> <span id="vi.ii.x-p16.1"></span> “Go into the way, the whole tribe of
> you handicrafts-men,  
> Who worship Jove’s fierce-eyed daughter, <span
> id="fr_985"></span>[986](#fn_985.md) the working goddess,  
> With fans duly placed, fools that ye are”—  

<span id="vi.ii.x-p18"></span>fashioners of stones, and worshippers of
them. Let your Phidias, and Polycletus, and your Praxiteles and Apelles
too, come, and all that are engaged in mechanical arts, who, being
themselves of the earth, are workers of the earth. “For then,” says a
certain prophecy, “the affairs here turn out unfortunately, when men put
their trust in images.” Let the meaner artists, too—for I will not stop
calling—come. None of these ever made a breathing image, or out of earth
moulded soft flesh. Who liquefied the marrow? or who solidified the
bones? Who stretched the nerves? who distended the veins? Who poured the
blood into them? Or who spread the skin? Who ever could have made eyes
capable of seeing? Who breathed spirit into the lifeless form? Who
bestowed righteousness? Who promised immortality? The Maker of the
universe alone; the Great Artist and Father has formed us, such a living
image as man is. But your Olympian Jove, the image of an image, greatly
out of harmony with truth, is the senseless work of Attic hands. For the
image of God is His Word, the genuine Son of Mind, the Divine Word, the
archetypal light of light; and the image of the Word is the true man,
the mind which is in man, who is therefore said to have been made “in
the image and likeness of God,” <span id="fr_986"></span>[987](#fn_986.md)
assimilated to the Divine Word in the affections of the soul, and
therefore rational; but effigies sculptured in human form, the earthly
image of that part of man which is visible and earth-born, are but a
perishable impress of humanity, manifestly wide of the truth. That life,
then, which is occupied with so much earnestness about matter, seems to
me to be nothing else than full of insanity. And custom, which has made
you taste bondage and unreasonable care, is fostered by vain opinion;
and ignorance, which has proved to the human race the cause of unlawful
rites and delusive shows, and also of deadly plagues and hateful images,
has, by devising many shapes of demons, stamped on all that follow it
the mark of long-continued death. Receive, then, the water of the word;
wash, ye polluted ones; purify yourselves from custom, by sprinkling
yourselves with the drops of truth. <span
id="fr_987"></span>[988](#fn_987.md) The pure must ascend to heaven. Thou
art a man, if we look to that which is most common to thee and
others—seek Him who created thee; thou art a son, if we look to that
which is thy peculiar prerogative—acknowledge thy Father. But do you
still continue in your sins, engrossed with pleasures? To whom shall the
Lord say, “Yours is the kingdom of heaven?” Yours, whose choice is set
on God, if you will; yours, if you will only believe, and comply with
the brief terms of the announcement; which the Ninevites having obeyed,
instead of the destruction they looked for, obtained a signal
deliverance. How, then, <span id="page_200">p. 200</span> <span
id="vi.ii.x-Page_200"></span>may I ascend to heaven, is it said? The
Lord is the way; a strait way, but leading from heaven, strait in truth,
but leading back to heaven, strait, despised on earth; broad, adored in
heaven.

<span id="vi.ii.x-p21"></span>Then, he that is uninstructed in the word,
has ignorance as the excuse of his error; but as for him into whose ears
instruction has been poured, and who deliberately maintains his
incredulity in his soul, the wiser he appears to be, the more harm will
his understanding do him; for he has his own sense as his accuser for
not having chosen the best part. For man has been otherwise constituted
by nature, so as to have fellowship with God. As, then, we do not compel
the horse to plough, or the bull to hunt, but set each animal to that
for which it is by nature fitted; so, placing our finger on what is
man’s peculiar and distinguishing characteristic above other creatures,
we invite him—born, as he is, for the contemplation of heaven, and
being, as he is, a truly heavenly plant—to the knowledge of God,
counselling him to furnish himself with what is his sufficient provision
for eternity, namely piety. Practise husbandry, we say, if you are a
husbandman; but while you till your fields, know God. Sail the sea, you
who are devoted to navigation, yet call the whilst on the heavenly
Pilot. <span id="fr_988"></span>[989](#fn_988.md) Has knowledge taken hold
of you while engaged in military service? Listen to the commander, who
orders what is right. As those, then, who have been overpowered with
sleep and drunkenness, do ye awake; and using your eyes a little,
consider what mean those stones which you worship, and the expenditure
you frivolously lavish on matter. Your means and substance you squander
on ignorance, even as you throw away your lives to death, having found
no other end of your vain hope than this. Not only unable to pity
yourselves, you are incapable even of yielding to the persuasions of
those who commiserate you; enslaved as you are to evil custom, and,
clinging to it voluntarily till your last breath, you are hurried to
destruction: “because light is come into the world, and men have loved
the darkness rather than the light,” <span
id="fr_989"></span>[990](#fn_989.md) while they could sweep away those
hindrances to salvation, pride, and wealth, and fear, repeating this
poetic utterance:—

> <span id="vi.ii.x-p23.2"></span> “Whither do I bear these abundant
> riches? and whither  
> Do I myself wander?” <span id="fr_990"></span>[991](#fn_990.md)  

<span id="vi.ii.x-p25"></span>If you wish, then, to cast aside these
vain phantasies, and bid adieu to evil custom, say to vain opinion:—

> <span id="vi.ii.x-p25.1"></span> “Lying dreams, farewell; you were
> then nothing.”  

<span id="vi.ii.x-p26"></span>For what, think you, O men, is the Hermes
of Typho, and that of Andocides, and that of Amyetus? Is it not evident
to all that they are stones, as is the veritable Hermes himself? As the
Halo is not a god, and as the Iris is not a god, but are states of the
atmosphere and of the clouds; and as, likewise, a day is not a god, nor
a year, nor time, which is made up of these, so neither is sun nor moon,
by which each of those mentioned above is determined. Who, then, in his
right senses, can imagine Correction, and Punishment, and Justice, and
Retribution to be gods? For neither the Furies, nor the Fates, nor
Destiny are gods, since neither Government, nor Glory, nor Wealth are
gods, which last \[as Plutus\] painters represent as blind. But if you
deify Modesty, and Love, and Venus, let these be followed by Infamy, and
Passion, and Beauty, and Intercourse. Therefore Sleep and Death cannot
reasonably any more be regarded as twin deities, being merely changes
which take place naturally in living creatures; no more will you with
propriety call Fortune, or Destiny, or the Fates goddesses. And if
Strife and Battle be not gods, no more are Ares and Enyo. Still further,
if the lightnings, and thunderbolts, and rains are not gods, how can
fire and water be gods? how can shooting stars and comets, which are
produced by atmospheric changes? He who calls Fortune a god, let him
also so call Action. If, then, none of these, nor of the images formed
by human hands, and destitute of feeling, is held to be a God, while a
providence exercised about us is evidently the result of a divine
power, <span id="fr_991"></span>[992](#fn_991.md) it remains only to
acknowledge this, that He alone who is truly God, only truly is and
subsists. But those who are insensible to this are like men who have
drunk mandrake or some other drug. May God grant that you may at length
awake from this slumber, and know God; and that neither Gold, nor Stone,
nor Tree, nor Action, nor Suffering, nor Disease, nor Fear, may appear
in your eyes as a god. For there are, in sooth, “on the fruitful earth
thrice ten thousand” demons, not immortal, nor indeed mortal; for they
are not endowed with sensation, so as to render them capable of death,
but only things of wood and stone, that hold despotic sway over men
insulting and violating life through the force of custom. “The earth is
the <span class="sc"><span id="vi.ii.x-p27.1"></span>Lord’s</span>,” it
is said, “and the fulness thereof.” <span
id="fr_992"></span>[993](#fn_992.md) Then why darest thou, while
luxuriating in the bounties of the Lord, to ignore the Sovereign Ruler?
“Leave my earth,” the Lord will say to thee. “Touch not the water which
I bestow. Partake not of the fruits of the earth produced by my
husbandry.” <span id="page_201">p. 201</span> <span
id="vi.ii.x-Page_201"></span>Give to God recompense for your sustenance;
acknowledge thy Master. Thou art God’s creature. What belongs to Him,
how can it with justice be alienated? For that which is alienated, being
deprived of the properties that belonged to it, is also deprived of
truth. For, after the fashion of Niobe, or, to express myself more
mystically, like the Hebrew woman called by the ancients Lot’s wife, are
ye not turned into a state of insensibility? This woman, we have heard,
was turned into stone for her love of Sodom. And those who are godless,
addicted to impiety, hard-hearted and foolish, are Sodomites. Believe
that these utterances are addressed to you from God. For think not that
stones, and stocks, and birds, and serpents are sacred things, and men
are not; but, on the contrary, regard men as truly sacred, <span
id="fr_993"></span>[994](#fn_993.md) and take beasts and stones for what
they are. For there are miserable wretches of human kind, who consider
that God utters His voice by the raven and the jackdaw, but says nothing
by man; and honour the raven as a messenger of God. But the man of God,
who croaks not, nor chatters, but speaks rationally and instructs
lovingly, alas, they persecute; and while he is inviting them to
cultivate righteousness, they try inhumanly to slay him, neither
welcoming the grace which comes from above, nor fearing the penalty. For
they believe not God, nor understand His power, whose love to man is
ineffable; and His hatred of evil is inconceivable. His anger augments
punishment against sin; His love bestows blessings on repentance. It is
the height of wretchedness to be deprived of the help which comes from
God. Hence this blindness of eyes and dulness of hearing are more
grievous than other inflictions of the evil one; for the one deprives
them of heavenly vision, the other robs them of divine instruction. But
ye, thus maimed as respects the truth, blind in mind, deaf in
understanding, are not grieved, are not pained, have had no desire to
see heaven and the Maker of heaven, nor, by fixing your choice on
salvation, have sought to hear the Creator of the universe, and to learn
of Him; for no hindrance stands in the way of him who is bent on the
knowledge of God. Neither childlessness, nor poverty, nor obscurity, nor
want, can hinder him who eagerly strives after the knowledge of God; nor
does any one who has conquered <span id="fr_994"></span>[995](#fn_994.md)
by brass or iron the true wisdom for himself choose to exchange it, for
it is vastly preferred to everything else. Christ is able to save in
every place. For he that is fired with ardour and admiration for
righteousness, being the lover of One who needs nothing, needs himself
but little, having treasured up his bliss in nothing but himself and
God, where is neither moth, <span id="fr_995"></span>[996](#fn_995.md)
robber, nor pirate, but the eternal Giver of good. With justice, then,
have you been compared to those serpents who shut their ears against the
charmers. For “their mind,” says the Scripture, “is like the serpent,
like the deaf adder, which stoppeth her ear, and will not hear the voice
of the charmers.” <span id="fr_996"></span>[997](#fn_996.md) But allow
yourselves to feel the influence of the charming strains of sanctity,
and receive that mild word of ours, and reject the deadly poison, that
it may be granted to you to divest yourselves as much as possible of
destruction, as they <span id="fr_997"></span>[998](#fn_997.md) have been
divested of old age. Hear me, and do not stop your ears; do not block up
the avenues of hearing, but lay to heart what is said. Excellent is the
medicine of immortality! Stop at length your grovelling reptile
motions. <span id="fr_998"></span>[999](#fn_998.md) “For the enemies of the
Lord,” says Scripture, “shall lick the dust.” <span
id="fr_999"></span>[1000](#fn_999.md) Raise your eyes from earth to the
skies, look up to heaven, admire the sight, cease watching with
outstretched head the heel of the righteous, and hindering the way of
truth. Be wise and harmless. Perchance the Lord will endow you with the
wing of simplicity (for He has resolved to give wings to those that are
earth-born), that you may leave your holes and dwell in heaven. Only let
us with our whole heart repent, that we may be able with our whole heart
to contain God. “Trust in Him, all ye assembled people; pour out all
your hearts before Him.” <span id="fr_1000"></span>[1001](#fn_1000.md) He
says to those that have newly abandoned wickedness, “He pities them, and
fills them with righteousness.” Believe Him who is man and God; believe,
O man. Believe, O man, the living God, who suffered and is adored.
Believe, ye slaves, <span id="fr_1001"></span>[1002](#fn_1001.md) Him who
died; believe, all ye of human kind, Him who alone is God of all men.
Believe, and receive salvation as your reward. Seek God, and your soul
shall live. He who seeks God is busying himself about his own salvation.
Hast thou found God?—then thou hast life. Let us then seek, in order
that we may live. The reward of seeking is life with God. “Let all who
seek Thee be glad and rejoice in Thee; and let them say continually, God
be magnified.” <span id="fr_1002"></span>[1003](#fn_1002.md) A noble hymn
of God is an immortal man, established in righteousness, in whom the
oracles of truth are engraved. For where but in a soul that is wise can
you write truth? where love? where reverence? where meekness? Those who
have had these divine <span id="page_202">p. 202</span> <span
id="vi.ii.x-Page_202"></span>characters impressed on them, ought, I
think, to regard wisdom as a fair port whence to embark, to whatever lot
in life they turn; and likewise to deem it the calm haven of salvation:
wisdom, by which those who have betaken themselves to the Father, have
proved good fathers to their children; and good parents to their sons,
those who have known the Son; and good husbands to their wives, those
who remember the Bridegroom; and good masters to their servants, <span
id="fr_1003"></span>[1004](#fn_1003.md) those who have been redeemed from
utter slavery. Oh, happier far the beasts than men involved in error!
who live in ignorance as you, but do not counterfeit the truth. There
are no tribes of flatterers among them. Fishes have no superstition: the
birds worship not a single image; only they look with admiration on
heaven, since, deprived as they are of reason, they are unable to know
God. So are you not ashamed for living through so many periods of life
in impiety, making yourselves more irrational than irrational creatures?
You were boys, then striplings, then youths, then men, but never as yet
were you good. If you have respect for old age, be wise, now that you
have reached life’s sunset; and albeit at the close of life, acquire the
knowledge of God, that the end of life may to you prove the beginning of
salvation. You have become old in superstition; as young, enter on the
practice of piety. God regards you as innocent children. Let, then, the
Athenian follow the laws of Solon, and the Argive those of Phoroneus,
and the Spartan those of Lycurgus: but if thou enrol thyself as one of
God’s people, heaven is thy country, God thy lawgiver. And what are the
laws? “Thou shalt not kill; thou shalt not commit adultery; thou shalt
not seduce boys; thou shalt not steal; thou shalt not bear false
witness; thou shalt love the Lord thy God.” <span
id="fr_1004"></span>[1005](#fn_1004.md) And the complements of these are
those laws of reason and words of sanctity which are inscribed on men’s
hearts: “Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself; to him who strikes
thee on the cheek, present also the other;” <span
id="fr_1005"></span>[1006](#fn_1005.md) “thou shalt not lust, for by lust
alone thou hast committed adultery.” <span
id="fr_1006"></span>[1007](#fn_1006.md) How much better, therefore, is it
for men from the beginning not to wish to desire things forbidden, than
to obtain their desires! But ye are not able to endure the austerity of
salvation; but as we delight in sweet things, and prize them higher for
the agreeableness of the pleasure they yield, while, on the other hand,
those bitter things which are distasteful to the palate are curative and
healing, and the harshness of medicines strengthens people of weak
stomach, thus custom pleases and tickles; but custom pushes into the
abyss, while truth conducts to heaven. Harsh it is at first, but a good
nurse of youth; and it is at once the decorous place where the household
maids and matrons dwell together, and the sage council-chamber. Nor is
it difficult to approach, or impossible to attain, but is very near us
in our very homes; as Moses, endowed with all wisdom, says, while
referring to it, it has its abode in three departments of our
constitution—in the hands, the mouth, and the heart: a meet emblem this
of truth, which is embraced by these three things in all—will, action,
speech. And be not afraid lest the multitude of pleasing objects which
rise before you withdraw you from wisdom. You yourself will
spontaneously surmount the frivolousness of custom, as boys when they
have become men throw aside their toys. For with a celerity
unsurpassable, and a benevolence to which we have ready access, the
divine power, casting its radiance on the earth, hath filled the
universe with the seed of salvation. For it was not without divine care
that so great a work was accomplished in so brief a space by the Lord,
who, though despised as to appearance, was in reality adored, the
expiator of sin, the Saviour, the clement, the Divine Word, He that is
truly most manifest Deity, He that is made equal to the Lord of the
universe; because He was His Son, and the Word was in God, not
disbelieved in by all when He was first preached, nor altogether unknown
when, assuming the character of man, and fashioning Himself in flesh, He
enacted the drama of human salvation: for He was a true champion and a
fellow-champion with the creature. And being communicated most speedily
to men, having dawned from His Father’s counsel quicker than the sun,
with the most perfect ease He made God shine on us. Whence He was and
what He was, He showed by what He taught and exhibited, manifesting
Himself as the Herald of the Covenant, the Reconciler, our Saviour, the
Word, the Fount of life, the Giver of peace, diffused over the whole
face of the earth; by whom, so to speak, the universe has already become
an ocean of blessings. <span id="fr_1007"></span>[1008](#fn_1007.md)

Latin version would run thus: “While a certain previous conception of
divine power is nevertheless discovered within us.” But adopting that in
the text the argument is: there is unquestionably a providence implying
the exertion of divine power. That power is not exercised by idols or
heathen gods. The only other alternative is, that it is exercised by the
one self-existent God.
