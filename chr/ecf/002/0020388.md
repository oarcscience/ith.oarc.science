##### <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIV.—Greek Plagiarism from the Hebrews.

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p1"></span>Let us add in completion what follows,
and exhibit now with greater clearness the plagiarism of the Greeks from
the Barbarian philosophy.

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p2"></span>Now the Stoics say that God, like the
soul, is essentially body and spirit. You will find all this explicitly
in their writings. Do not consider at present their allegories as the
gnostic truth presents them; whether they show one thing and mean
another, like the dexterous athletes. Well, they say that God pervades
all being; while we call Him solely Maker, and Maker by the Word. They
were misled by what is said in the book of Wisdom: “He pervades and
passes through all by reason of His purity;” <span
id="fr_3107"></span>[3108](#fn_3107.md) since they did not understand that
this was said of Wisdom, which was the first of the creation of God.

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p4"></span>So be it, they say. But the
philosophers, the Stoics, and Plato, and Pythagoras, nay more, Aristotle
the Peripatetic, suppose the existence of matter among the first
principles; and not one first principle. Let them then know that what is
called matter by them, is said by them to be without quality, and
without form, and more daringly said by Plato to be non-existence. And
does he not say very mystically, knowing that the true and real first
cause is one, in these very words: “Now, then, let our opinion be so. As
to the first principle or principles of the universe, or what opinion we
ought to entertain about all these points, we are not now to speak, for
no other cause than on account of its being difficult to explain our
sentiments in accordance with the present form of discourse.” But
undoubtedly that prophetic expression, “Now the earth was invisible and
formless,” supplied them with the ground of material essence.

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p5"></span>And the introduction of “chance” was
hence suggested to Epicurus, who misapprehended the statement, “Vanity
of vanities, and all is vanity.” And it occurred to Aristotle to extend
Providence as far as the moon from this psalm: “Lord, Thy mercy is in
the heavens; and Thy truth reacheth to the clouds.” <span
id="fr_3108"></span>[3109](#fn_3108.md) For the explanation of the
prophetic mysteries had not yet been revealed previous to the advent of
the Lord.

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p7"></span>Punishments after death, on the other
hand, and penal retribution by fire, were pilfered from the Barbarian
philosophy both by all the poetic Muses and by the Hellenic philosophy.
Plato, <span id="page_466">p. 466</span> <span
id="vi.iv.v.xiv-Page_466"></span>accordingly, in the last book of the
*Republic,* says in these express terms: “Then these men fierce and
fiery to look on, standing by, and hearing the sound, seized and took
some aside; and binding Aridæus and the rest hand, foot, and head, and
throwing them down, and flaying them, dragged them along the way,
tearing their flesh with thorns.” For the fiery men are meant to signify
the angels, who seize and punish the wicked. “Who maketh,” it is said,
“His angels spirits; His ministers flaming fire.” <span
id="fr_3109"></span>[3110](#fn_3109.md) It follows from this that the soul
is immortal. For what is tortured or corrected being in a state of
sensation lives, though said to suffer. Well! Did not Plato know of the
rivers of fire and the depth of the earth, and Tartarus, called by the
Barbarians Gehenna, naming, as he does prophetically, <span
id="fr_3110"></span>[3111](#fn_3110.md) Cocytus, and Acheron, and
Pyriphlegethon, and introducing such corrective tortures for discipline?

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p10"></span>But indicating “the angels” as the
Scripture says, “of the little ones, and of the least, which see God,”
and also the oversight reaching to us exercised by the tutelary
angels, <span id="fr_3111"></span>[3112](#fn_3111.md) he shrinks not from
writing, “That when all the souls have selected their several lives,
according as it has fallen to their lot, they advance in order to
Lachesis; and she sends along with each one, as his guide in life, and
the joint accomplisher of his purposes, the demon which he has chosen.”
Perhaps also the demon of Socrates suggested to him something similar.

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p12"></span>Nay, the philosophers. having so heard
from Moses, taught that the world was created. <span
id="fr_3112"></span>[3113](#fn_3112.md) And so Plato expressly said,
“Whether was it that the world had no beginning of its existence, or
derived its beginning from some beginning? For being visible, it is
tangible; and being tangible, it has a body.” Again, when he says, “It
is a difficult task to find the Maker and Father of this universe,” he
not only showed that the universe was created, but points out that it
was generated by him as a son, and that he is called its father, as
deriving its being from him alone, and springing from non-existence. The
Stoics, too, hold the tenet that the world was created.

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p14"></span>And that the devil so spoken of by the
Barbarian philosophy, the prince of the demons, is a wicked spirit,
Plato asserts in the tenth book of the *Laws,* in these words: “Must we
not say that spirit which pervades the things that are moved on all
sides, pervades also heaven? Well, what? One or more? Several, say I, in
reply for you. Let us not suppose fewer than two—that which is
beneficent, and that which is able to accomplish the opposite.”
Similarly in the *Phœdrus* he writes as follows: “Now there are other
evils. But some demon has mingled pleasure with the most things at
present.” Further, in the tenth book of the *Laws,* he expressly emits
that apostolic sentiment, <span id="fr_3113"></span>[3114](#fn_3113.md)
“Our contest is not with flesh and blood, but principalities, with
powers, with the spiritual things of those which are in heaven;” writing
thus: “For since we are agreed that heaven is full of many good beings;
but it is also full of the opposite of these, and more of these; and as
we assert such a contest is deathless, and requiring marvellous
watchfulness.”

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p16"></span>Again the Barbarian philosophy knows
the world of thought and the world of sense—the former archetypal, and
the latter the image of that which is called the model; and assigns the
former to the Monad, as being perceived by the mind, and the world of
sense to the number six. For six is called by the Pythagoreans marriage,
as being the genital number; and he places in the Monad the invisible
heaven and the holy earth, and intellectual light. For “in the
beginning,” it is said, “God made the heaven and the earth; and the
earth was invisible.” And it is added, “And God said, Let there be
light; and there was light.” <span id="fr_3114"></span>[3115](#fn_3114.md)
And in the material cosmogony He creates a solid heaven (and what is
solid is capable of being perceived by sense), and a visible earth, and
a light that is seen. Does not Plato hence appear to have left the ideas
of living creatures in the intellectual world, and to make intellectual
objects into sensible species according to their genera? Rightly then
Moses says, that the body which Plato calls “the earthly tabernacle” was
formed of the ground, but that the rational soul was breathed by God
into man’s face. For there, they say, the ruling faculty is situated;
interpreting the access by the senses into the first man as the addition
of the soul.

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p18"></span>Wherefore also man is said “to have
been made in \[God’s\] image and likeness.” For the image of God is the
divine and royal Word, the impassible man; and the image of the image is
the human mind. And if you wish to apprehend the likeness by another
name, you will find it named in Moses, a divine correspondence. For he
says, “Walk after the Lord your God, and keep His commandments.” <span
id="fr_3115"></span>[3116](#fn_3115.md) And I reckon all the virtuous,
servants and followers of God. Hence the Stoics say that the end of
philosophy is to live agreeable to nature; and Plato, likeness to God,
as we have shown in the second Miscellany. And Zeno the Stoic, borrowing
from Plato, and he from the Barbarian philosophy, says that all the good
are friends of one another. For Socrates says in the *Phœdrus*, “that it
has not been ordained that the bad should be a friend <span
id="page_467">p. 467</span> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-Page_467"></span>to
the bad, nor the good be not a friend to the good;” as also he showed
sufficiently in the *Lysis*, that friendship is never preserved in
wickedness and vice. And the Athenian stranger similarly says, “that
there is conduct pleasing and conformable to God, based on one ancient
ground-principle, That like loves like, provided it be within measure.
But things beyond measure are congenial neither to what is within nor
what is beyond measure. Now it is the case that God is the measure to us
of all things.” Then proceeding, Plato <span
id="fr_3116"></span>[3117](#fn_3116.md) adds: “For every good man is like
every other good man; and so being like to God, he is liked by every
good man and by God.” At this point I have just recollected the
following. In the end of the *Timæus* he says: “You must necessarily
assimilate that which perceives to that which is perceived, according to
its original nature; and it is by so assimilating it that you attain to
the end of the highest life proposed by the gods to men, <span
id="fr_3117"></span>[3118](#fn_3117.md) for the present or the future
time.” For those have equal power with these. He, who seeks, will not
stop till he find; and having found, he will wonder; and wondering, he
will reign; and reigning, he will rest. And what? Were not also those
expressions of Thales derived from these? The fact that God is glorified
for ever, and that He is expressly called by us the Searcher of hearts,
he interprets. For Thales being asked, What is the divinity? said, What
has neither beginning nor end. And on another asking, “If a man could
elude the knowledge of the Divine Being while doing aught?” said, “How
could he who cannot do so while thinking?”

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p22"></span>Further, the Barbarian philosophy
recognises good as alone excellent, and virtue as sufficient for
happiness, when it says, “Behold, I have set before your eyes good and
evil, life and death, that ye may choose life.” <span
id="fr_3118"></span>[3119](#fn_3118.md) For it calls good, “life,” and the
choice of it excellent, and the choice of the opposite “evil.” And the
end of good and of life is to become a lover of God: “For this is thy
life and length of days,” to love that which tends to the truth. And
these points are yet clearer. For the Saviour, in enjoining to love God
and our neighbour, says, “that on these two commandments hang the whole
law and the prophets.” Such are the tenets promulgated by the Stoics;
and before these, by Socrates, in the *Phœdrus*, who prays, “O Pan, and
ye other gods, give me to be beautiful within.” And in the *Theœtetus*
he says expressly, “For he that speaks well (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p23.2"></span>καλῶς</span>) is both beautiful and good.”
And in the *Protagoras* he avers to the companions of Protagoras that he
has met with one more beautiful than Alcibiades, if indeed that which is
wisest is most beautiful. For he said that virtue was the soul’s beauty,
and, on the contrary, that vice was the soul’s deformity. Accordingly,
Antipatrus the Stoic, who composed three books on the point, “That,
according to Plato, only the beautiful is good,” shows that, according
to him, virtue is sufficient for happiness; and adduces several other
dogmas agreeing with the Stoics. And by Aristobulus, who lived in the
time of Ptolemy Philadelphus, who is mentioned by the composer of the
epitome of the books of the Maccabees, there were abundant books to show
that the Peripatetic philosophy was derived from the law of Moses and
from the other prophets. Let such be the case.

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p24"></span>Plato plainly calls us brethren, as
being of one God and one teacher, in the following words: “For ye who
are in the state are entirely brethren (as we shall say to them,
continuing our story). But the God who formed you, mixed gold in the
composition of those of you who are fit to rule, at your birth,
wherefore you are most highly honoured; and silver in the case of those
who are helpers; and steel and brass in the case of farmers and other
workers.” Whence, of necessity, some embrace and love those things to
which knowledge pertains; and others matters of opinion. Perchance he
prophesies of that elect nature which is bent on knowledge; if by the
supposition he makes of three natures he does not describe three
politics, as some supposed: that of the Jews, the silver; that of the
Greeks, the third; and that of the Christians, with whom has been
mingled the regal gold, the Holy Spirit, the golden. <span
id="fr_3119"></span>[3120](#fn_3119.md)

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p26"></span>And exhibiting the Christian life, he
writes in the *Theætetus* in these words: “Let us now speak of the
highest principles. For why should we speak of those who make an abuse
of philosophy? These know neither the way to the forum, nor know they
the court or the senate-house, or any other public assembly of the
state. As for laws and decrees spoken or <span
id="fr_3120"></span>[3121](#fn_3120.md) written, they neither see nor hear
them. But party feelings of political associations and public meetings,
and revels with musicians \[occupy them\]; but they never even dream of
taking part in affairs. Has any one conducted himself either well or ill
in the state, or has aught evil descended to a man from his
forefathers?—it escapes their attention as much as do the sands of the
sea. And the man does not even know that he does not know all these
things; but in reality his body alone is situated and dwells in the
state, <span id="fr_3121"></span>[3122](#fn_3121.md) while the man himself
flies, according to Pindar, beneath the earth and above the sky,
astronomizing, and exploring all nature on all sides.

<span id="page_468">p. 468</span> <span
id="vi.iv.v.xiv-Page_468"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p29"></span>Again, with the Lord’s saying, “Let
your yea be yea, and your nay nay,” may be compared the following: “But
to admit a falsehood, and destroy a truth, is in nowise lawful.” With
the prohibition, also, against swearing agrees the saying in the tenth
book of the *Laws:* “Let praise and an oath in everything be absent.”

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p30"></span>And in general, Pythagoras, and
Socrates, and Plato say that they hear God’s voice while closely
contemplating the fabric of the universe, made and preserved unceasingly
by God. For they heard Moses say, “He said, and it was done,” describing
the word of God as an act.

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p31"></span>And founding on the formation of man
from the dust, the philosophers constantly term the body earthy. Homer,
too, does not hesitate to put the following as an imprecation:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p31.1"></span> “But may you all become earth and
> water.”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p32"></span>As Esaias says, “And trample them down
as clay.” And Callimachus clearly writes:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p32.1"></span> “That was the year in which  
> Birds, fishes, quadrupeds,  
> Spoke like Prometheus’ clay.”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p33"></span>And the same again:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p33.1"></span> “If thee Prometheus formed,  
> And thou art not of other clay.”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p34"></span>Hesiod says of Pandora:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p34.1"></span> “And bade Hephæstus, famed, with
> all his speed,  
> Knead earth with water, and man’s voice and mind  
> Infuse.”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p35"></span>The Stoics, accordingly, define nature
to be artificial fire, advancing systematically to generation. And God
and His Word are by Scripture figuratively termed fire and light. But
how? Does not Homer himself, is not Homer himself, paraphrasing the
retreat of the water from the land, and the clear uncovering of the dry
land, when he says of Tethys and Oceanus:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p35.1"></span> “For now for a long time they
> abstain from  
> Each other’s bed and love?” <span
> id="fr_3122"></span>[3123](#fn_3122.md)  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p37"></span>Again, power in all things is by the
most intellectual among the Greeks ascribed to God; Epicharmus—he was a
Pythagorean—saying:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p37.1"></span> “Nothing escapes the divine. This
> it behoves thee to know.  
> He is our observer. To God nought is impossible.”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p38"></span>And the lyric poet:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p38.1"></span> “And God from gloomy night  
> Can raise unstained light,  
> And can in darksome gloom obscure  
> The day’s refulgence pure.”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p39"></span>He alone who is able to make night
during the period of day is God.

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p40"></span>In the *Phœnomena* Aratus writes
thus:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p40.1"></span> “With Zeus let us begin; whom let
> us ne’er,  
> Being men, leave unexpressed. All full of Zeus,  
> The streets, and throngs of men, and full the sea,  
> And shores, and everywhere we Zeus enjoy.”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p41"></span>He adds:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p41.1"></span> “For we also are  
> His offspring;  .  .  .  . ”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p42"></span>that is, by creation.

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p42.1"></span> “Who, bland to men,  
> Propitious signs displays, and to their tasks  
> Arouses. For these signs in heaven He fixed,  
> The constellations spread, and crowned the year  
> With stars; to show to men the seasons’ tasks,  
> That all things may proceed in order sure.  
> Him ever first, Him last too, they adore:  
> Hail Father, marvel great—great boon to men.”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p43"></span>And before him, Homer, framing the
world in accordance with Moses on the Vulcan-wrought shield, says:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p43.1"></span> “On it he fashioned earth, and
> sky, and sea,  
> And all the signs with which the heaven is crowned.” <span
> id="fr_3123"></span>[3124](#fn_3123.md)  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p45"></span>For the Zeus celebrated in poems and
prose compositions leads the mind up to God. And already, so to speak,
Democritus writes, “that a few men are in the light, who stretch out
their hands to that place which we Greeks now call the air. Zeus speaks
all, and he hears all, and distributes and takes away, and he is king of
all.” And more mystically the Bœotian Pindar, being a Pythagorean,
says:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p45.1"></span> “One is the race of gods and
> men,  
> And of one mother both have breath;”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p46"></span>that is, of matter: and names the one
creator of these things, whom he calls Father, chief artificer, who
furnishes the means of advancement on to divinity, according to merit.

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p47"></span>For I pass over Plato; he plainly, in
the Epistle to Erastus and Coriscus, is seen to exhibit the Father and
Son somehow or other from the Hebrew Scriptures, exhorting in these
words: “In invoking by oath, with not illiterate gravity, and with
culture, the sister of gravity, God the author of all, and invoking Him
by oath as the Lord, the Father of the Leader, and author; whom if ye
study with a truly philosophical spirit, ye shall know.” And the address
in the *Timœus* calls the creator, Father, speaking thus: “Ye gods of
gods, of whom I am Father; and the Creator of your works.” So that when
he says, “Around the king of all, all things are, and because of Him are
all things; and he \[or that\] is the cause of all good things; and
around the second are the things second in order; and around the third,
the third,” I understand nothing else than the Holy Trinity to be meant;
for the third is the Holy Spirit, and the Son is the second, by whom all
things were made according to the will of the Father. <span
id="fr_3124"></span>[3125](#fn_3124.md)

<span id="page_469">p. 469</span> <span
id="vi.iv.v.xiv-Page_469"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p49"></span>And the same, in the tenth book of the
*Republic,* mentions Eros the son of Armenius, who is Zoroaster.
Zoroaster, then, writes: “These were composed by Zoroaster, the son of
Armenius, a Pamphylian by birth: having died in battle, and been in
Hades, I learned them of the gods.” This Zoroaster, Plato says, having
been placed on the funeral pyre, rose again to life in twelve days. He
alludes perchance to the resurrection, or perchance to the fact that the
path for souls to ascension lies through the twelve signs of the zodiac;
and he himself says, that the descending pathway to birth is the same.
In the same way we are to understand the twelve labours of Hercules,
after which the soul obtains release from this entire world.

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p50"></span>I do not pass over Empedocles, who
speaks thus physically of the renewal of all things, as consisting in a
transmutation into the essence of fire, which is to take place. And most
plainly of the same opinion is Heraclitus of Ephesus, who considered
that there was a world everlasting, and recognised one perishable—that
is, in its arrangement, not being different from the former, viewed in a
certain aspect. But that he knew the imperishable world which consists
of the universal essence to be everlastingly of a certain nature, he
makes clear by speaking thus: “The same world of all things, neither any
of the gods, nor any one of men, made. But there was, and is, and will
be ever-living fire, kindled according to measure, <span
id="fr_3125"></span>[3126](#fn_3125.md) and quenched according to measure.”
And that he taught it to be generated and perishable, is shown by what
follows: “There are transmutations of fire,—first, the sea; and of the
sea the half is land, the half fiery vapour.” For he says that these are
the effects of power. For fire is by the Word of God, which governs all
things, changed by the air into moisture, which is, as it were, the germ
of cosmical change; and this he calls sea. And out of it again is
produced earth, and sky, and all that they contain. How, again, they are
restored and ignited, he shows clearly in these words: “The sea is
diffused and measured according to the same rule which subsisted before
it became earth.” Similarly also respecting the other elements, the same
is to be understood. The most renowned of the Stoics teach similar
doctrines with him, in treating of the conflagration and the government
of the world, and both the world and man properly so called, and of the
continuance of our souls.

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p52"></span>Plato, again, in the seventh book of
the *Republic,* has called “the day here nocturnal,” as I suppose, on
account of “the world-rulers of this darkness;” <span
id="fr_3126"></span>[3127](#fn_3126.md) and the descent of the soul into
the body, sleep and death, similarly with Heraclitus. And was not this
announced, oracularly, of the Saviour, by the Spirit, saying by David,
“I slept, and slumbered; I awoke: for the <span class="sc"><span
id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p53.2"></span>Lord</span> will sustain me;“ <span
id="fr_3127"></span>[3128](#fn_3127.md) For He not only figuratively calls
the resurrection of Christ rising from sleep; but to the descent of the
Lord into the flesh he also applies the figurative term sleep. The
Saviour Himself enjoins, “Watch;” <span
id="fr_3128"></span>[3129](#fn_3128.md) as much as to say, “Study how to
live, and endeavour to separate the soul from the body.”

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p56"></span>And the Lord’s day Plato prophetically
speaks of in the tenth book of the *Republic,* in these words: “And when
seven days have passed to each of them in the meadow, on the eighth they
are to set out and arrive in four days.” <span
id="fr_3129"></span>[3130](#fn_3129.md) By the meadow is to be understood
the fixed sphere, as being a mild and genial spot, and the locality of
the pious; and by the seven days each motion of the seven planets, and
the whole practical art which speeds to the end of rest. But after the
wandering orbs the journey leads to heaven, that is, to the eighth
motion and day. And he says that souls are gone on the fourth day,
pointing out the passage through the four elements. But the seventh day
is recognised as sacred, not by the Hebrews only, but also by the
Greeks; according to which the whole world of all animals and plants
revolve. Hesiod says of it:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p57.1"></span> “The first, and fourth, and
> seventh day were held sacred.”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p58"></span>And again:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p58.1"></span> “And on the seventh the sun’s
> resplendent orb.”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p59"></span>And Homer:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p59.1"></span> “And on the seventh then came the
> sacred day.”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p60"></span>And:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p60.1"></span> “The seventh was sacred.”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p61"></span>And again:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p61.1"></span> “It was the seventh day, and all
> things were accomplished.”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p62"></span>And again:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p62.1"></span> “And on the seventh morn we leave
> the stream of Acheron.”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p63"></span>Callimachus the poet also writes:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p63.1"></span> “It was the seventh morn, and
> they had all things done.”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p64"></span>And again:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p64.1"></span> “Among good days is the seventh
> day, and the seventh race.”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p65"></span>And:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p65.1"></span> “The seventh is among the prime,
> and the seventh is perfect.”  

<span id="page_470">p. 470</span> <span
id="vi.iv.v.xiv-Page_470"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p66"></span>And:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p66.1"></span> “Now all the seven were made in
> starry heaven,  
> In circles shining as the years appear.”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p67"></span>The Elegies of Solon, too, intensely
deify the seventh day.

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p68"></span>And how? Is it not similar to
Scripture when it says, “Let us remove the righteous man from us,
because he is troublesome to us?” <span
id="fr_3130"></span>[3131](#fn_3130.md) when Plato, all but predicting the
economy of salvation, says in the second book of the *Republic* as
follows: “Thus he who is constituted just shall be scourged, shall be
stretched on the rack, shall be bound, have his eyes put out; and at
last, having suffered all evils, shall be crucified.” <span
id="fr_3131"></span>[3132](#fn_3131.md)

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p71"></span>And the Socratic Antisthenes,
paraphrasing that prophetic utterance, “To whom have ye likened me?
saith the Lord,” <span id="fr_3132"></span>[3133](#fn_3132.md) says that
“God is like no one; wherefore no one can come to the knowledge of Him
from an image.”

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p73"></span>Xenophon too, the Athenian, utters
these similar sentiments in the following words: “He who shakes all
things, and is Himself immoveable, is manifestly one great and powerful.
But what He is in form, appears not. No more does the sun, who wishes to
shine in all directions, deem it right to permit any one to look on
himself. But if one gaze on him audaciously, he loses his eyesight.”

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p73.1"></span> “What flesh can see with eyes the
> Heavenly, True,  
> Immortal God, whose dwelling is the poles?  
> Not even before the bright beams of the sun  
> Are men, as being mortal, fit to stand,”—  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p74"></span>the Sibyl had said before. Rightly,
then, Xenophanes of Colophon, teaching that God is one and incorporeal,
adds:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p74.1"></span> “One God there is ’midst gods and
> men supreme;  
> In form, in mind, unlike to mortal men.”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p75"></span>And again:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p75.1"></span> “But men have the idea that gods
> are born,  
> And wear their clothes, and have both voice and shape.”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p76"></span>And again:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p76.1"></span> “But had the oxen or the lions
> hands,  
> Or could with hands depict a work like men,  
> Were beasts to draw the semblance of the gods,  
> The horses would them like to horses sketch,  
> To oxen, oxen, and their bodies make  
> Of such a shape as to themselves belongs.”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p77"></span>Let us hear, then, the lyric poet
Bacchylides speaking of the divine:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p77.1"></span> “Who to diseases dire <span
> id="fr_3133"></span>[3134](#fn_3133.md) never succumb,  
> And blameless are; in nought resembling men.”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p79"></span>And also Cleanthes, the Stoic, who
writes thus in a poem on the Deity: <span
id="fr_3134"></span>[3135](#fn_3134.md) —

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p80.1"></span> “If you ask what is the nature of
> the good, listen—  
> That which is regular, just, holy, pious,  
> Self-governing, useful, fair, fitting,  
> Grave, independent, always beneficial,  
> That feels no fear or grief, profitable, painless,  
> Helpful, pleasant, safe, friendly,  
> Held in esteem, agreeing with itself: honourable,  
> Humble, careful, meek, zealous,  
> Perennial, blameless, ever-during.”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p81"></span>And the same, tacitly vilifying the
idolatry of the multitude, adds:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p81.1"></span> “Base is every one who looks to
> opinion,  
> With the view of deriving any good from it.”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p82"></span>We are not, then, to think of God
according to the opinion of the multitude.

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p82.1"></span> “For I do not think that
> secretly,  
> Imitating the guise of a scoundrel,  
> He would go to thy bed as a man,”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p83"></span>says Amphion to Antiope. And Sophocles
plainly writes:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p83.1"></span> “His mother Zeus espoused,  
> Not in the likeness of gold, nor covered  
> With swan’s plumage, as the Pleuronian girl  
> He impregnated; but an out and out man.”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p84"></span>He further proceeds, and adds:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p84.1"></span> “And quick the adulterer stood on
> the bridal steps.”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p85"></span>Then he details still more plainly the
licentiousness of the fabled Zeus:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p85.1"></span> “But he nor food nor cleansing
> water touched,  
> But heart-stung went to bed, and that whole night  
> Wantoned.”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p86"></span>But let these be resigned to the
follies of the theatre.

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p87"></span>Heraclius plainly says: “But of the
word which is eternal men are not able to understand, both before they
have heard it, and on first hearing it.” And the lyrist Melanippides
says in song:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p87.1"></span> “Hear me, O Father, Wonder of
> men,  
> Ruler of the ever-living soul.”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p88"></span>And Parmenides the great, as Plato
says in the *Sophist*, writes of God thus:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p88.1"></span> “Very much, since unborn and
> indestructible He is,  
> Whole, only-begotten, and immoveable, and unoriginated.”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p89"></span>Hesiod also says:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p89.1"></span> “For He of the immortals all is
> King and Lord.  
> With God <span id="fr_3135"></span>[3136](#fn_3135.md) none else in might
> may strive.”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p91"></span>Nay more, Tragedy, drawing away from
idols, teaches to look up to heaven. Sophocles, as Hecatæus, who
composed the histories in the work about Abraham and the Egyptians,
says, exclaims plainly on the stage:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p91.1"></span> “One in very truth, God is One,  
> Who made the heaven and the far-stretching earth,  
> <span id="page_471">p. 471</span> <span
> id="vi.iv.v.xiv-Page_471"></span> The Deep’s blue billow, and the
> might of winds.  
> But of us mortals, many erring far  
> In heart, as solace for our woes, have raised  
> Images of gods—of stone, or else of brass,  
> Or figures wrought of gold or ivory;  
> And sacrifices and vain festivals  
> To these appointing, deem ourselves devout.”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p92"></span>And Euripides on the stage, in
tragedy, says:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p92.1"></span> “Dost thou this lofty, boundless
> Ether see,  
> Which holds the earth around in the embrace  
> Of humid arms? This reckon Zeus,  
> And this regard as God.”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p93"></span>And in the drama of Pirithous, the
same writes those lines in tragic vein:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p93.1"></span> “Thee, self-sprung, who on
> Ether’s wheel  
> Hast universal nature spun,  
> Around whom Light and dusky spangled Night,  
> The countless host of stars, too, ceaseless dance.”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p94"></span>For there he says that the creative
mind is self-sprung. What follows applies to the universe, in which are
the opposites of light and darkness.

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p95"></span>Æschylus also, the son of Euphorion,
says with very great solemnity of God:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p95.1"></span> “Ether is Zeus, Zeus earth, and
> Zeus the heaven;  
> The universe is Zeus, and all above.”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p96"></span>I am aware that Plato assents to
Heraclitus, who writes: “The one thing that is wise alone will not be
expressed, and means the name of Zeus.” And again, “Law is to obey the
will of one.” And if you wish to adduce that saying, “He that hath ears
to hear, let him hear,” you will find it expressed by the Ephesian <span
id="fr_3136"></span>[3137](#fn_3136.md) to the following effect: “Those
that hear without understanding are like the deaf. The proverb witnesses
against them, that when present they are absent.”

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p98"></span>But do you want to hear from the
Greeks expressly of one first principle? Timæus the Locrian, in the work
on Nature, shall testify in the following words: “There is one first
principle of all things unoriginated. For were it originated, it would
be no longer the first principle; but the first principle would be that
from which it originated.” For this true opinion was derived from what
follows: “Hear,” it is said, “O Israel; the <span class="sc"><span
id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p98.1"></span>Lord</span> thy God is one, and Him only
shalt thou serve.” <span id="fr_3137"></span>[3138](#fn_3137.md)

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p99.2"></span> “Lo <span
> id="fr_3138"></span>[3139](#fn_3138.md) He all sure and all unerring
> is,”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p101"></span>says the Sibyl.

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p102"></span>Homer also manifestly mentions the
Father and the Son by a happy hit of divination in the following words:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p102.1"></span> “If Outis, <span
> id="fr_3139"></span>[3140](#fn_3139.md) alone as thou art, offers thee
> violence,  
> And there is no escaping disease sent by Zeus,—  
> For the Cyclopes heed not Ægis-bearing Zeus.” <span
> id="fr_3140"></span>[3141](#fn_3140.md)  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p105"></span>And before him Orpheus said, speaking
of the point in hand:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p105.1"></span> “Son of great Zeus, Father of
> Ægis-bearing Zeus.”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p106"></span>And Xenocrates the Chalcedonian, who
mentions the supreme Zeus and the inferior Zeus, leaves an indication of
the Father and the Son. Homer, while representing the gods as subject to
human passions, appears to know the Divine Being, whom Epicurus does not
so revere. He says accordingly:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p106.1"></span> “Why, son of Peleus, mortal as
> thou art,  
> With swift feet me pursuest, a god  
> Immortal? Hast thou not yet known  
> That I am a god?” <span id="fr_3141"></span>[3142](#fn_3141.md)  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p108"></span>For he shows that the Divinity cannot
be captured by a mortal, or apprehended either with feet, or hands, or
eyes, or by the body at all. “To whom have ye likened the Lord? or to
what likeness have ye likened Him?” says the Scripture. <span
id="fr_3142"></span>[3143](#fn_3142.md) Has not the artificer made the
image? or the goldsmith, melting the gold, has gilded it, and what
follows.

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p110"></span>The comic poet Epicharmus speaks in
the *Republic* clearly of the Word in the following terms:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p110.1"></span> “The life of men needs
> calculation and number alone,  
> And we live by number and calculation, for these save mortals.” <span
> id="fr_3143"></span>[3144](#fn_3143.md)  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p112"></span>He then adds expressly:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p112.1"></span> “Reason governs mortals, and
> alone preserves manners.”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p113"></span>Then:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p113.1"></span> “There is in man reasoning; and
> there is a divine Reason. <span id="fr_3144"></span>[3145](#fn_3144.md)  
> Reason is implanted in man to provide for life and sustenance,  
> But divine Reason attends the arts in the case of all,  
> Teaching them always what it is advantageous to do.  
> For it was not man that discovered art, but God brought it;  
> And the Reason of man derives its origin from the divine Reason.”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p115"></span>The Spirit also cries by Isaiah:
“Wherefore the multitude of sacrifices? saith the <span class="sc"><span
id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p115.1"></span>Lord</span>. I am full of holocausts of
rams, and the fat of lambs and the blood of bulls I wish not;” and a
little after adds: “Wash you, and be clean. Put away wickedness from
your souls,” <span id="fr_3145"></span>[3146](#fn_3145.md) and so forth.

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p117"></span>Menander, the comic poet, writes in
these very words:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p117.1"></span> “If one by offering sacrifice, a
> crowd  
> Of bulls or kids, O Pamphilus, by Zeus.  
> Or such like things; by making works of art,  
> Garments of gold or purple, images  
> <span id="page_472">p. 472</span> <span
> id="vi.iv.v.xiv-Page_472"></span> Of ivory or emerald, deems by
> these  
> God can be made propitious, he does err,  
> And has an empty mind. For the man must prove  
> A man of worth, who neither maids deflowers,  
> Nor an adulterer is, nor steals, nor kills  
> For love of worldly wealth, O Pamphilus.  
> Nay, covet not a needle’s thread. For God  
> Thee sees, being near beside thee.” . . .  <span
> id="fr_3146"></span>[3147](#fn_3146.md)  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p119"></span>“I am a God at hand,” it is said by
Jeremiah, <span id="fr_3147"></span>[3148](#fn_3147.md) “and not a God afar
off. Shall a man do aught in secret places, and I shall not see him?”

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p121"></span>And again Menander, paraphrasing that
Scripture, “Sacrifice a sacrifice of righteousness, and trust in the
Lord,” <span id="fr_3148"></span>[3149](#fn_3148.md) thus writes:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p122.2"></span> “And not a needle even that is  
> Another’s ever covet, dearest friend;  
> For God in righteous works delights, and so  
> Permits him to increase his worldly wealth,  
> Who toils, and ploughs the land both night and day.  
> But sacrifice to God, and righteous be,  
> Shining not in bright robes, but in thy heart;  
> And when thou hear’st the thunder, do not flee,  
> Being conscious to thyself of nought amiss,  
> Good sir, for thee God ever present sees.” <span
> id="fr_3149"></span>[3150](#fn_3149.md)  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p124"></span>“Whilst thou art yet speaking,” says
the Scripture, “I will say, Lo, here I am.” <span
id="fr_3150"></span>[3151](#fn_3150.md)

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p126"></span>Again Diphilus, the comic poet,
discourses as, follows on the judgment:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p126.1"></span> “Think’st thou, O Niceratus,
> that the dead,  
> Who in all kinds of luxury in life have shared,  
> Escape the Deity, as if forgot?  
> There is an eye of justice, which sees all.  
> For two ways, as we deem, to Hades lead—  
> One for the good, the other for the bad.  
> But if the earth hides both for ever, then  
> Go plunder, steal, rob, and be turbulent.  
> But err not. For in Hades judgment is,  
> Which God the Lord of all will execute,  
> Whose name too dreadful is for me to name,  
> Who gives to sinners length of earthly life.  
> If any mortal thinks, that day by day,  
> While doing ill, he eludes the gods’ keen sight,  
> His thoughts are evil; and when justice has  
> The leisure, he shall then detected be  
> So thinking. Look, whoe’er you be that say  
> That there is not a God. There is, there is.  
> If one, by nature evil, evil does,  
> Let him redeem the time; for such as he  
> Shall by and by due punishment receive.” <span
> id="fr_3151"></span>[3152](#fn_3151.md)  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p128"></span>And with this agrees the
tragedy <span id="fr_3152"></span>[3153](#fn_3152.md) in the following
lines:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p129.1"></span> “For there shall come, shall
> come <span id="fr_3153"></span>[3154](#fn_3153.md) that point of time,  
> When Ether, golden-eyed, shall ope its store  
> Of treasured fire; and the devouring flame,  
> Raging, shall burn all things on earth below,  
> And all above.” …  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p131"></span>And after a little he adds:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p131.1"></span> “And when the whole world
> fades,  
> And vanished all the abyss of ocean’s waves,  
> And earth of trees is bare; and wrapt in flames,  
> The air no more begets the winged tribes;  
> Then He who all destroyed, shall all restore.”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p132"></span>We shall find expressions similar to
these also in the Orphic hymns, written as follows:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p132.1"></span> “For having hidden all, brought
> them again  
> To gladsome light, forth from his sacred heart,  
> Solicitous.”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p133"></span>And if we live throughout holily and
righteously, we are happy here, and shall be happier after our departure
hence; not possessing happiness for a time, but enabled to rest in
eternity.

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p133.1"></span> “At the same hearth and table as
> the rest  
> Of the immortal gods, we sit all free  
> Of human ills, unharmed,”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p134"></span>says the philosophic poetry of
Empedocles. And so, according to the Greeks, none is so great as to be
above judgment, none so insignificant as to escape its notice.

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p135"></span>And the same Orpheus speaks thus:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p135.1"></span> “But to the word divine,
> looking, attend,  
> Keeping aright the heart’s receptacle  
> Of intellect, and tread the straight path well,  
> And only to the world’s immortal King  
> Direct thy gaze.” <span id="fr_3154"></span>[3155](#fn_3154.md)  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p137"></span>And again, respecting God, saying
that He was invisible, and that He was known to but one, a Chaldean by
race—meaning either by this Abraham or his son—he speaks as follows:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p137.1"></span> “But one a scion of Chaldean
> race;  
> For he the sun’s path knew right well,  
> And how the motion of the sphere about  
> The earth proceeds, in circle moving  
> Equally around its axis, how the winds  
> Their chariot guide o’er air and sea.”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p138"></span>Then, as if paraphrasing the
expression, “Heaven is my throne, and earth is my footstool,” <span
id="fr_3155"></span>[3156](#fn_3155.md) he adds:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p139.2"></span> “But in great heaven, He is
> seated firm  
> Upon a throne of gold, and ’neath His feet  
> The earth. His right hand round the ocean’s bound  
> He stretches; and the hills’ foundations shake  
> To the centre at His wrath, nor can endure  
> His mighty strength. He all celestial is,  
> And all things finishes upon the earth.  
> He the Beginning, Middle is, and End.  
> But Thee I dare not speak. In limbs  
> And mind I tremble. He rules from on high.”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p140"></span>And so forth. For in these he
indicates these prophetic utterances: “If Thou openest the heaven,
trembling shall seize the mountains from Thy presence; and they shall
melt, as wax melteth before the fire;” <span
id="fr_3156"></span>[3157](#fn_3156.md) and in Isaiah, “Who hath measured
the heaven with a span, and the whole earth with His fist? <span
id="fr_3157"></span>[3158](#fn_3157.md) Again, when it is said:—

<span id="page_473">p. 473</span> <span
id="vi.iv.v.xiv-Page_473"></span>

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p142.1"></span> “Ruler of Ether, Hades, Sea, and
> Land,  
> Who with Thy bolts Olympus’ strong-built home  
> Dost shake. Whom demons dread, and whom the throng  
> Of gods do fear. Whom, too, the Fates obey,  
> Relentless though they be. O deathless One,  
> Our mother’s Sire! whose wrath makes all things reel;  
> Who mov’st the winds, and shroud’st in clouds the world,  
> Broad Ether cleaving with Thy lightning gleams,—  
> Thine is the order ’mongst the stars, which run  
> As Thine unchangeable behests direct.  
> Before Thy burning throne the angels wait,  
> Much-working, charged to do all things, for men.  
> Thy young Spring shines, all prank’d with purple flowers;  
> Thy Winter with its chilling clouds assails;  
> Thine Autumn noisy Bacchus distributes.”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p143"></span>Then he adds, naming expressly the
Almighty God:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p143.1"></span> “Deathless Immortal, capable of
> being  
> To the immortals only uttered! Come,  
> Greatest of gods, with strong Necessity.  
> Dread, invincible, great, deathless One,  
> Whom Ether crowns.” …  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p144"></span>By the expression “Sire of our
Mother” (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p144.1"></span>μητροπάτωρ</span>) he not only intimates
creation out of nothing, but gives occasion to those who introduce
emissions of imagining a consort of the Deity. And he paraphrases those
prophetic Scripture—that in Isaiah, “I am He that fixes the thunder, and
creates the wind; whose hands have founded the host of heaven;” <span
id="fr_3158"></span>[3159](#fn_3158.md) and that in Moses, “Behold, behold
that I am He, and there is no god beside me: I will kill, and I will
make to live; I will smite, and I will heal: and there is none that
shall deliver out of my hands.” <span
id="fr_3159"></span>[3160](#fn_3159.md)

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p146.2"></span> “And He, from good, to mortals
> planteth ill,  
> And cruel war, and tearful woes,”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p147"></span>according to Orpheus.

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p148"></span>Such also are the words of the Parian
Archilochus.

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p148.1"></span> “O Zeus, thine is the power of
> heaven, and thou  
> Inflict’st on men things violent and wrong.” <span
> id="fr_3160"></span>[3161](#fn_3160.md)  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p150"></span>Again let the Thracian Orpheus sing
to us:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p150.1"></span> “His right hand all around to
> ocean’s bound  
> He stretches; and beneath His feet is earth.”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p151"></span>These are plainly derived from the
following: “The Lord will save the inhabited cities, and grasp the whole
land in His hand like a nest;” <span
id="fr_3161"></span>[3162](#fn_3161.md) “It is the Lord that made the earth
by His power,” as saith Jeremiah, “and set up the earth by His
wisdom.” <span id="fr_3162"></span>[3163](#fn_3162.md) Further, in addition
to these, Phocylides, who calls the angels demons, explains in the
following words that some of them are good, and others bad (for we also
have learned that some are apostate):—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p153.2"></span> “Demons there are—some here,
> some there—set over men;  
> Some, on man’s entrance \[into life\], to ward off ill.”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p154"></span>Rightly, then, also Philemon, the
comic poet demolishes idolatry in these words:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p154.1"></span> “Fortune is no divinity to us:  
> There’s no such god. But what befalls by chance  
> And of itself to each, is Fortune called.”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p155"></span>And Sophocles the tragedian says:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p155.1"></span> “Not even the gods have all
> things as they choose,  
> Excepting Zeus; for he beginning is and end.”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p156"></span>And Orpheus:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p156.1"></span> “One Might, the great, the
> flaming heaven, was  
> One Deity. All things one Being were; in whom  
> All these revolve fire, water, and the earth.”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p157"></span>And so forth.

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p158"></span>Pindar, the lyric poet, as if in
Bacchic frenzy, plainly says:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p158.1"></span> “What is God? The All.”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p159"></span>And again:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p159.1"></span> “God, who makes all mortals.”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p160"></span>And when he says,—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p160.1"></span> “How little, being a man, dost
> thou expect  
> Wisdom for man? ’Tis hard for mortal mind  
> The counsels of the gods to scan; and thou  
> Wast of a mortal mother born,”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p161"></span>he drew the thought from the
following: “Who hath known the mind of the <span class="sc"><span
id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p161.1"></span>Lord</span>, or who was His
counsellor?” <span id="fr_3163"></span>[3164](#fn_3163.md) Hesiod, too,
agrees with what is said above, in what he writes:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p162.2"></span> “No prophet, sprung of men that
> dwell on earth,  
> Can know the mind of Ægis-bearing Zeus.”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p163"></span>Similarly, then, Solon the Athenian,
in the *Elegies*, following Hesiod, writes:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p163.1"></span> “The immortal’s mind to men is
> quite unknown.”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p164"></span>Again Moses, having prophesied that
the woman would bring forth in trouble and pain, on account of
transgression, a poet not undistinguished writes:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p164.1"></span> “Never by day  
> From toil and woe shall they have rest, nor yet  
> By night from groans. Sad cares the gods to men  
> Shall give.”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p165"></span>Further, when Homer says,—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p165.1"></span> “The Sire himself the golden
> balance held,” <span id="fr_3164"></span>[3165](#fn_3164.md)  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p167"></span>he intimates that God is just.

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p168"></span>And Menander, the comic poet, in
exhibiting God, says:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p168.1"></span> “To each man, on his birth,
> there is assigned  
> A tutelary Demon, as his life’s good guide.  
> For that the Demon evil is, and harms  
> A good life, is not to be thought.”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p169"></span>Then he adds:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p169.1"></span> “<span class="Greek"><span
> id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p169.3"></span>Ἅπαντα δ᾽ ἁγαθὸν εἱναι τὸν
> Θεόν</span>,”  

<span id="page_474">p. 474</span> <span
id="vi.iv.v.xiv-Page_474"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p170"></span>meaning either “that every one good
is God,” or, what is preferable, “that God in all things is good.”

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p171"></span>Again, Æschylus the tragedian,
setting forth the power of God, does not shrink from calling Him the
Highest, in these words:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p171.1"></span> “Place God apart from mortals;
> and think not  
> That He is, like thyself, corporeal.  
> Thou know’st Him not. Now He appears as fire,  
> Dread force; as water now; and now as gloom;  
> And in the beasts is dimly shadowed forth,  
> In wind, and cloud, in lightning, thunder, rain;  
> And minister to Him the seas and rocks,  
> Each fountain and the water’s floods and streams.  
> The mountains tremble, and the earth, the vast  
> Abyss of sea, and towering height of hills,  
> When on them looks the Sovereign’s awful eye:  
> Almighty is the glory of the Most High God.” <span
> id="fr_3165"></span>[3166](#fn_3165.md)  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p173"></span>Does he not seem to you to paraphrase
that text, “At the presence of the Lord the earth trembles?” <span
id="fr_3166"></span>[3167](#fn_3166.md) In addition to these, the most
prophetic Apollo is compelled—thus testifying to the glory of God—to say
of Athene, when the Medes made war against Greece, that she besought and
supplicated Zeus for Attica. The oracle is as follows:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p174.2"></span> “Pallas cannot Olympian Zeus
> propitiate,  
> Although with many words and sage advice she prays;  
> But he will give to the devouring fire many temples of the
> immortals,  
> Who now stand shaking with terror, and bathed in sweat;” <span
> id="fr_3167"></span>[3168](#fn_3167.md)  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p176"></span>and so forth.

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p177"></span>Thearidas, in his book *On Nature*,
writes: “There was then one really true beginning \[first principle\] of
all that exist”—one. For that Being in the beginning is one and alone.”

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p177.1"></span> “Nor is there any other except
> the Great King,”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p178"></span>says Orpheus. In accordance with
whom, the comic poet Diphilus says very sententiously, <span
id="fr_3168"></span>[3169](#fn_3168.md) the

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p179.4"></span> “Father of all,  
> To Him alone incessant reverence pay,  
> The inventor and the author of such blessings.”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p180"></span>Rightly therefore Plato “accustoms
the best natures to attain to that study which formerly we said was the
highest, both to see the good and to accomplish that ascent. And this,
as appears, is not the throwing of the potsherds; <span
id="fr_3169"></span>[3170](#fn_3169.md) but the turning round of the soul
from a nocturnal day to that which is a true return to that which really
is, which we shall assert to be the true philosophy.” Such as are
partakers of this he judges <span id="fr_3170"></span>[3171](#fn_3170.md)
to belong to the golden race, when he says: “Ye are all brethren; and
those who are of the golden race are most capable of judging most
accurately in every respect.” <span id="fr_3171"></span>[3172](#fn_3171.md)

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p184"></span>The Father, then, and Maker of all
things is apprehended by all things, agreeably to all, by innate power
and without teaching,—things inanimate, sympathizing with the animate
creation; and of living beings some are already immoral, working in the
light of day. But of those that are still mortal, some are in fear, and
carried still in their mother’s womb; and others regulate themselves by
their own independent reason. And of men all are Greeks and Barbarians.
But no race anywhere of tillers of the soil, or nomads, and not even of
dwellers in cities, can live, without being imbued with the faith of a
superior being. <span id="fr_3172"></span>[3173](#fn_3172.md) Wherefore
every eastern nation, and every nation touching the western shore; or
the north, and each one towards the south, <span
id="fr_3173"></span>[3174](#fn_3173.md) —all have one and the same
preconception respecting Him who hath appointed government; since the
most universal of His operations equally pervade all. Much more did the
philosophers among the Greeks, devoted to investigation, starting from
the Barbarian philosophy, attribute providence <span
id="fr_3174"></span>[3175](#fn_3174.md) to the “Invisible, and sole, and
most powerful, and most skilful and supreme cause of all things most
beautiful;”—not knowing the inferences from these truths, unless
instructed by us, and not even how God is to be known naturally; but
only, as we have already often said, by a true periphrasis. <span
id="fr_3175"></span>[3176](#fn_3175.md) Rightly therefore the apostle says,
“Is He the God of the Jews only, and not also of the Greeks?”—not only
saying prophetically that of the Greeks believing Greeks would know
God; <span id="fr_3176"></span>[3177](#fn_3176.md) but also intimating that
in power the Lord is the God of all, and truly Universal King. For they
know neither what He is, nor how He is Lord, and Father, and Maker, nor
the rest of the system of the truth, without being taught by it. Thus
also the prophetic utterances have the same force as the apostolic word.
For Isaiah says, “If ye say, We trust in the <span class="sc"><span
id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p189.2"></span>Lord</span> our God: now make an alliance
with my Lord the king of the Assyrians.” And he adds: “And now, was it
without the <span class="sc"><span
id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p189.3"></span>Lord</span> that we came up to this land
to make war against it?” <span id="fr_3177"></span>[3178](#fn_3177.md) And
Jonah, himself a prophet, intimates the same thing in what he says: “And
the shipmaster came to him, and <span id="page_475">p. 475</span> <span
id="vi.iv.v.xiv-Page_475"></span>said to him, Why dost thou snore? Rise,
call on thy God, that He may save us, and that we may not perish.” <span
id="fr_3178"></span>[3179](#fn_3178.md) For the expression “thy God” he
makes as if to one who knew Him by way of knowledge; and the expression,
“that God may save us,” revealed the consciousness in the minds of
heathens who had applied their mind to the Ruler of all, but had not yet
believed. And again the same: “And he said to them, I am the servant of
the <span class="sc"><span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p191.2"></span>Lord</span>;
and I fear the <span class="sc"><span
id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p191.3"></span>Lord</span>, the God of heaven.” And
again the same: “And he said, Let us by no means perish for the life of
this man.” And Malachi the prophet plainly exhibits God saying, “I will
not accept sacrifice at your hands. For from the rising of the sun to
its going down, My name is glorified among the Gentiles; and in every
place sacrifice is offered to Me.” <span
id="fr_3179"></span>[3180](#fn_3179.md) And again: “Because I am a great
King, saith the <span class="sc"><span
id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p192.2"></span>Lord</span> omnipotent; and My name is
manifest among the nations.” What name? The Son declaring the Father
among the Greeks who have believed.

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p193"></span>Plato in what follows gives an
exhibition of free-will: “Virtue owns not a master; and in proportion as
each one honours or dishonours it, in that proportion he will be a
partaker of it. The blame lies in the exercise of free choice.” But God
is blameless. For He is never the author of evil.

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p194"></span>“O warlike Trojans,” says the lyric
poet, <span id="fr_3180"></span>[3181](#fn_3180.md) —

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p195.1"></span> “High ruling Zeus, who beholds
> all things,  
> Is not the cause of great woes to mortals;  
> But it is in the power of all men to find  
> Justice, holy, pure,  
> Companion of order,  
> And of wise Themis  
> The sons of the blessed are ye  
> In finding her as your associate.”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p196"></span>And Pindar expressly introduces also
Zeus Soter, the consort of Themis, proclaiming him King, Saviour, Just,
in the following lines:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p196.1"></span> “First, prudent Themis, of
> celestial birth,  
> On golden steeds, by Ocean’s rock,  
> The Fates brought to the stair sublime,  
> The shining entrance of Olympus,  
> Of Saviour Zeus for aye <span id="fr_3181"></span>[3182](#fn_3181.md) to
> be the spouse,  
> And she, the Hours, gold-diademed, fair-fruited, good, brought
> forth.” <span id="fr_3182"></span>[3183](#fn_3182.md)  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p199"></span>He, then, who is not obedient to the
truth, and is puffed up with human teaching, is wretched and miserable,
according to Euripides:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p199.1"></span> “Who these things seeing, yet
> apprehends not God,  
> But mouthing lofty themes, casts far  
> Perverse deceits; stubborn in which, the tongue  
> Its shafts discharges, about things unseen,  
> Devoid of sense.”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p200"></span>Let him who wishes, then, approaching
to the true instruction, learn from Parmenides the Eleatic, who
promises:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p200.1"></span> “Ethereal nature, then, and all
> the signs  
> In Ether thou shall know, and the effects,  
> All viewless, of the sacred Sun’s clear torch  
> And whence produced. The round-eyed Moon’s  
> Revolving influences and nature thou  
> Shall learn; and the ensphering heaven shall know;  
> Whence sprung; and how Necessity took it  
> And chained so as to keep the starry bounds.”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p201"></span>And Metrodorus, though an Epicurean,
spoke thus, divinely inspired: “Remember, O Menestratus, that, being a
mortal endowed with a circumscribed life, thou hast in thy soul
ascended, till thou hast seen endless time, and the infinity of things;
and what is to be, and what has been;” when with the blessed choir,
according to Plato, we shall gaze on the blessed sight and vision; we
following with Zeus, and others with other deities, if we may be
permitted so to say, to receive initiation into the most blessed
mystery: which we shall celebrate, ourselves being perfect and
untroubled by the ills which awaited us at the end of our time; and
introduced to the knowledge of perfect and tranquil visions, and
contemplating them in pure sunlight; we ourselves pure, and now no
longer distinguished by that, which, when carrying it about, we call the
body, being bound to it like an oyster to its shell.

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p202"></span>The Pythagoreans call heaven the
Antichthon \[the opposite Earth\]. And in this land, it is said by
Jeremiah, “I will place thee among the children, and give thee the
chosen land as inheritance of God Omnipotent;” <span
id="fr_3183"></span>[3184](#fn_3183.md) and they who inherit it shall reign
over the earth. Myriads on myriads of examples <span
id="fr_3184"></span>[3185](#fn_3184.md) rush on my mind which might adduce.
But for the sake of symmetry the discourse must now stop, in order that
we may not exemplify the saying of Agatho the tragedian:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p204.1"></span> “Treating our by-work as work,  
> And doing our work as by-work.”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p205"></span>It having been, then, as I think,
clearly shown in what way it is to be understood that the Greeks were
called thieves by the Lord, I willingly leave the dogmas of the
philosophers. For were we to go over their sayings, we should gather
together directly such a quantity of notes, in showing that the whole of
the Hellenic wisdom was derived from the Barbarian philosophy. But this
speculation, we shall, nevertheless, again touch on, as necessity
requires, when we collect the opinions current among the Greeks
respecting first principles.

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p206"></span>But from what has been said, it
tacitly devolves on us to consider in what way the Hellenic books <span
id="page_476">p. 476</span> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-Page_476"></span>are
to be perused by the man who is able to pass through the billows in
them. Therefore

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p206.1"></span> “Happy is he who possesses the
> wealth of the divine mind,”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p207"></span>as appears according to Empedocles,

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p207.1"></span> “But wretched he, who cares for
> dark opinion about the Gods.”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p208"></span>He divinely showed knowledge and
ignorance to be the boundaries of happiness and misery. “For it behoves
philosophers to be acquainted with very many things,” according to
Heraclitus; and truly must

> <span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p208.1"></span> “He, who seeks to be good, err
> in many things.”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p209"></span>It is then now clear to us, from what
has been said, that the beneficence of God is eternal, and that, from an
unbeginning principle, equal natural righteousness reached all,
according to the worth of each several race,—never having had a
beginning. For God did not make a beginning of being Lord and Good,
being always what He is. Nor will He ever cease to do good, although He
bring all things to an end. And each one of us is a partaker of His
beneficence, as far as He wills. For the difference of the elect is made
by the intervention of a choice worthy of the soul, and by exercise.

<span id="vi.iv.v.xiv-p210"></span>Thus, then, let our fifth Miscellany
of gnostic notes in accordance with the true philosophy be brought to a
close.
