##### <span id="vi.iii.ii.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.—On Filthy Speaking.

<span id="vi.iii.ii.vi-p1"></span>From filthy speaking we ourselves must
entirely abstain, and stop the mouths of those who practice it by stern
looks and averting the face, and by what we call making a mock of one:
often also by a harsher mode of speech. “For what proceedeth out of the
mouth,” He says, “defileth a man,” <span
id="fr_1420"></span>[1421](#fn_1420.md) —shows him to be unclean, and
heathenish, and untrained, and licentious, and not select, and proper,
and honourable, and temperate. <span
id="fr_1421"></span>[1422](#fn_1421.md)

<span id="vi.iii.ii.vi-p4"></span>And as a similar rule holds with
regard to hearing and seeing in the case of what is obscene, the divine
Instructor, following the same course with both, arrays those children
who are engaged in the struggle in words of modesty, as ear-guards, so
that the pulsation of fornication may not penetrate to the bruising of
the soul; and He directs the eyes to the sight of what is honourable,
saying that it is better to make a slip with the feet than with the
eyes. This filthy speaking the apostle beats off, saying, “Let no
corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but what is
good.” <span id="fr_1422"></span>[1423](#fn_1422.md) And again, “As
becometh saints, let not filthiness be named among you, nor foolish
talking, nor jesting, which things are not seemly, but rather giving of
thanks.” <span id="fr_1423"></span>[1424](#fn_1423.md) And if “he that
calls his brother a fool be in danger of the judgment,” what shall we
pronounce regarding him who speaks what is foolish? Is it not written
respecting such: “Whosoever shall speak an idle word, shall give an
account to the Lord in the day of judgment?” <span
id="fr_1424"></span>[1425](#fn_1424.md) And again, “By thy speech thou
<span id="page_251">p. 251</span> <span
id="vi.iii.ii.vi-Page_251"></span>shalt be justified,” He says, “and by
thy speech thou shalt be condemned.” <span
id="fr_1425"></span>[1426](#fn_1425.md) What, then, are the salutary
ear-guards, and what the regulations for slippery eyes? Conversations
with the righteous, preoccupying and forearming the ears against those
that would lead away from the truth.

> <span id="vi.iii.ii.vi-p8.2"></span> “Evil communications corrupt good
> manners,”  

<span id="vi.iii.ii.vi-p9"></span>says Poetry. More nobly the apostle
says, “Be haters of the evil; cleave to the good.” <span
id="fr_1426"></span>[1427](#fn_1426.md) For he who associates with the
saints shall be sanctified. From shameful things addressed to the ears,
and words and sights, we must entirely abstain. <span
id="fr_1427"></span>[1428](#fn_1427.md) And much more must we keep pure
from shameful deeds: on the one hand, from exhibiting and exposing parts
of the body which we ought not; and on the other, from beholding what is
forbidden. For the modest son could not bear to look on the shameful
exposure of the righteous man; and modesty covered what intoxication
exposed—the spectacle of the transgression of ignorance. <span
id="fr_1428"></span>[1429](#fn_1428.md) No less ought we to keep pure from
calumnious reports, to which the ears of those who have believed in
Christ ought to be inaccessible.

<span id="vi.iii.ii.vi-p13"></span>It is on this account, as appears to
me, that the Instructor does not permit us to give utterance to aught
unseemly, fortifying us at an early stage against licentiousness. For He
is admirable always at cutting out the roots of sins, such as, “Thou
shalt not commit adultery,” by “Thou shalt not lust.” <span
id="fr_1429"></span>[1430](#fn_1429.md) For adultery is the fruit of lust,
which is the evil root. And so likewise also in this instance the
Instructor censures licence in names, and thus cuts off the licentious
intercourse of excess. For licence in names produces the desire of being
indecorous in conduct; and the observance of modesty in names is a
training in resistance to lasciviousness. We have shown in a more
exhaustive treatise, that neither in the names nor in the members to
which appellations not in common use are applied, is there the
designation of what is really obscene.

<span id="vi.iii.ii.vi-p15"></span>For neither are knee and leg, and
such other members, nor are the names applied to them, and the activity
put forth by them, obscene. And even the *pudenda* are to be regarded as
objects suggestive of modesty, not shame. It is their unlawful activity
that is shameful, and deserving ignominy, and reproach, and punishment.
For the only thing that is in reality shameful is wickedness, and what
is done through it. In accordance with these remarks, conversation about
deeds of wickedness is appropriately termed filthy \[shameful\]
speaking, as talk about adultery and pæderasty and the like. Frivolous
prating, too, is to be put to silence. <span
id="fr_1430"></span>[1431](#fn_1430.md) “For,” it is said, “in much
speaking thou shalt not escape sin.” <span
id="fr_1431"></span>[1432](#fn_1431.md) “Sins of the tongue, therefore,
shall be punished.” “There is he who is silent, and is found wise; and
there is he that is hated for much speech.” <span
id="fr_1432"></span>[1433](#fn_1432.md) But still more, the prater makes
himself the object of disgust. “For he that multiplieth speech
abominates his own soul.” <span id="fr_1433"></span>[1434](#fn_1433.md)
