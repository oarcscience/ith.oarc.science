##### <span id="vi.iv.viii.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.—To Prevent Ambiguity, We Must Begin with Clear Definition.

<span id="vi.iv.viii.iv-p1"></span>For every question is solved from
pre-existing knowledge. And the knowledge pre-existing of each object of
investigation is sometimes merely of the essence, while its functions
are unknown (as of stones, and plants, and animals, of whose operations
we are ignorant), or \[the knowledge\] of the properties, or powers, or
(so to speak) of the qualities inherent in the objects. And sometimes we
may know some one or more of those powers or properties,—as, for
example, the desires and affections of the soul,—and be ignorant of the
essence, and make it the object of investigation. But in many instances,
our understanding having assumed all these, the question is, in which of
the essences do they thus inhere; for it is after forming conceptions of
both—that is, both of essence and operation—in our mind, that we proceed
to the question. And there are also some objects, whose operations,
along with their essences, we know, but are ignorant of their
modifications.

<span id="vi.iv.viii.iv-p2"></span>Such, then, is the method of the
discovery \[of truth\]. For we must begin with the knowledge of the
questions to be discussed. For often the form of the expression deceives
and confuses and disturbs the mind, so that it is not easy to discover
to what class the thing is to be referred; as, for example, whether the
fœtus be an animal. For, having a conception of an animal and a fœtus,
we inquire if it be the case that the fœtus is an animal; that is, if
the substance which is in the fœtal state possesses the power of motion,
and of sensation besides. So that the inquiry is regarding functions and
sensations in a substance previously known. Consequently the man who
proposes the question is to be first asked, what he calls an animal.
Especially is this to be done whenever we find the same term applied to
various purposes; and we must examine whether what is signified by the
term is disputed, or admitted by all. For were one to say that he calls
whatever grows and is fed an animal, we shall have again to ask further,
whether he considered plants to be animals; and then, after declaring
himself to this effect, he must show what it is which is in the fœtal
state, and is nourished.

<span id="vi.iv.viii.iv-p3"></span>For Plato calls plants animals, as
partaking of the third species of life alone, that of appetency. <span
id="fr_3706"></span>[3707](#fn_3706.md) But Aristotle, while he thinks that
plants are possessed of a life of vegetation and nutrition, does not
consider it proper to call them animals; for that alone, which possesses
the other life—that of sensation—he considers warrantable to be called
an animal. The Stoics do not call the power of vegetation, life.

<span id="vi.iv.viii.iv-p5"></span>Now, on the man who proposes the
question denying that plants are animals, we shall show that he affirms
what contradicts himself. For, having defined the animal by the fact of
its <span id="page_561">p. 561</span> <span
id="vi.iv.viii.iv-Page_561"></span>nourishment and growth, but having
asserted that a plant is not an animal, it appears that he says nothing
else than that what is nourished and grows is both an animal and not an
animal.

<span id="vi.iv.viii.iv-p6"></span>Let him, then, say what he wants to
learn. Is it whether what is in the womb grows and is nourished, or is
it whether it possesses any sensation or movement by impulse? For,
according to Plato, the plant is animate, and an animal; but, according
to Aristotle, not an animal, for it wants sensation, but is animate.
Therefore, according to him, an animal is an animate sentient being. But
according to the Stoics, a plant is neither animate nor an animal; for
an animal is an animate being. If, then, an animal is animate, and life
is sentient nature, it is plain that what is animate is sentient. If,
then, he who has put the question, being again interrogated if he still
calls the animal in the fœtal state an animal on account of its being
nourished and growing, he has got his answer.

<span id="vi.iv.viii.iv-p7"></span>But were he to say that the question
he asks is, whether the fœtus is already sentient, or capable of moving
itself in consequence of any impulse, the investigation of the matter
becomes clear, the fallacy in the name no longer remaining. But if he do
not reply to the interrogation, and will not say what he means, or in
respect of what consideration it is that he applies the term “animal” in
propounding the question, but bids us define it ourselves, let him be
noted as disputatious.

<span id="vi.iv.viii.iv-p8"></span>But as there are two methods, one by
question and answer, and the other the method of exposition, if he
decline the former, let him listen to us, while we expound all that
bears on the problem. Then when we have done, he may treat of each point
in turn. But if he attempt to interrupt the investigation by putting
questions, he plainly does not want to hear.

<span id="vi.iv.viii.iv-p9"></span>But if he choose to reply, let him
first be asked, To what thing he applies the name, animal. And when he
has answered this, let him be again asked, what, in his view, the fœtus
means, whether that which is in the womb, or things already formed and
living; and again, if the fœtus means the seed deposited, or if it is
only when members and a shape are formed that the name of embryos is to
be applied. And on his replying to this, it is proper that the point in
hand be reasoned out to a conclusion, in due order, and taught.

<span id="vi.iv.viii.iv-p10"></span>But if he wishes us to speak without
him answering, let him hear. Since you will not say in what sense you
allege what you have propounded (for I would not have thus engaged in a
discussion about meanings, but I would now have looked at the things
themselves), know that you have done just as if you had propounded the
question, Whether a dog were an animal? For I might have rightly said,
Of what dog do you speak? For I shall speak of the land dog and the sea
dog, and the constellation in heaven, and of Diogenes too, and all the
other dogs in order. For I could not divine whether you inquire about
all or about some one. What you shall do subsequently is to learn now,
and say distinctly what it is that your question is about. Now if you
are shuffling about names, it is plain to everybody that the name
*fœtus* is neither an animal nor a plant, but a name, and a sound, and a
body, and a being, and anything and everything rather than an animal.
And if it is this that you have propounded, you are answered.

<span id="vi.iv.viii.iv-p11"></span>But neither is that which is denoted
by the name *fœtus* an animal. But that is incorporeal, and may be
called a thing and a notion, and everything rather than an animal. The
nature of an animal is different. For it was clearly shown respecting
the very point in question, I mean the nature of the embryo, of what
sort it is. The question respecting the meanings expressed by the name
animal is different.

<span id="vi.iv.viii.iv-p12"></span>I say, then, if you affirm that an
animal is what has the power of sensation and of moving itself from
appetency, that an animal is not simply what moves through appetency and
is possessed of sensation. For it is also capable of sleeping, or, when
the objects of sensation are not present, of not exercising the power of
sensation. But the natural power of appetency or of sensation is the
mark of an animal. For something of this nature is indicated by these
things. First, if the fœtus is not capable of sensation or motion from
appetency; which is the point proposed for consideration. Another point
is; if the fœtus is capable of ever exercising the power of sensation or
moving through appetency. In which sense no one makes it a question,
since it is evident.

<span id="vi.iv.viii.iv-p13"></span>But the question was, whether the
embryo is already an animal, or still a plant. And then the name animal
was reduced to definition, for the sake of perspicuity. But having
discovered that it is distinguished from what is not an animal by
sensation and motion from appetency; we again separated this from its
adjuncts; asserting that it was one thing for that to be such
*potentially,* which is not yet possessed of the power of sensation and
motion, but will some time be so, and another thing to be already so
*actually;* and in the case of such, it is one thing to exert its
powers, another to be able to exert them, but to be at rest or asleep.
And this is the question.

<span id="vi.iv.viii.iv-p14"></span>For the embryo is not to be called
an animal from the fact that it is nourished; which is the allegation of
those who turn aside from the essence of the question, and apply their
minds <span id="page_562">p. 562</span> <span
id="vi.iv.viii.iv-Page_562"></span>to what happens otherwise. But in the
case of all conclusions alleged to be found out, demonstration is
applied in common, which is discourse (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.viii.iv-p14.1"></span>λόγος</span>), establishing one thing
from others. But the grounds from which the point in question is to be
established, must be admitted and known by the learner. And the
foundation of all these is what is evident to sense and to intellect.

<span id="vi.iv.viii.iv-p15"></span>Accordingly the primary
demonstration is composed of all these. But the demonstration which,
from points already demonstrated thereby, concludes some other point, is
no less reliable than the former. It cannot be termed primary, because
the conclusion is not drawn from primary principles as premisses.

<span id="vi.iv.viii.iv-p16"></span>The first species, then, of the
different kinds of questions, which are three, has been exhibited—I mean
that, in which the essence being known, some one of its powers or
properties is unknown. The second variety of propositions was that in
which we all know the powers and properties, but do not know the
essence; as, for example, in what part of the body is the principal
faculty of the soul.
