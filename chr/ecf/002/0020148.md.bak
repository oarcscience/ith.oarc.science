##### <span id="iv.ii.iii.xi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XI.—Of Repentance.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.xi-p1"></span>And when the people transgressed the
law which had been given to them by God, God being good and pitiful,
unwilling to destroy them, in addition to His giving them the law,
afterwards sent forth also prophets to them from among their brethren,
to teach and remind them of the contents of the law, and to turn them to
repentance, that they might sin no more. But if they persisted in their
wicked deeds, He forewarned them that they should be delivered into
subjection to all the kingdoms of the earth; and that this has already
happened them is manifest. Concerning repentance, then, Isaiah the
prophet, generally indeed to all, but expressly to the people, says:
“Seek ye the <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.ii.iii.xi-p1.1"></span>Lord</span> while He may be found, call ye
upon Him while He is near: let the wicked forsake his ways, and the
unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the <span
class="sc"><span id="iv.ii.iii.xi-p1.2"></span>Lord</span> his God, and
he will find mercy, for He will abundantly pardon.” <span
id="fr_650"></span>[651](#fn_650.md) And another prophet, Ezekiel, says:
“If the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath committed, and
keep all My statutes, and do that which is right in My sight, he shall
surely live, he shall not die. All his transgressions that he hath
committed, they shall not be mentioned unto him; but in his
righteousness that he hath done he shall live: for I desire not the
death of the sinner, saith the Lord, but that he turn from his wicked
way, and live.” <span id="fr_651"></span>[652](#fn_651.md) Again Isaiah:
“Ye who take deep and wicked counsel, turn ye, that ye may be
saved.” <span id="fr_652"></span>[653](#fn_652.md) And another prophet,
Jeremiah: “Turn to the <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.ii.iii.xi-p4.2"></span>Lord</span> your God, as a grape-gatherer
to his basket, and ye shall find mercy.” <span
id="fr_653"></span>[654](#fn_653.md) Many therefore, yea rather, countless
are the sayings in the Holy Scriptures regarding repentance, God being
always desirous that the race of men turn from all their sins.
