##### <span id="iv.ii.i.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.—The Invisible God Perceived Through His Works.

<span id="iv.ii.i.v-p1"></span>For as the soul in man is not seen, being
invisible to men, but is perceived through the motion of the body, so
God cannot indeed be seen by human eyes, but is beheld and perceived
through His providence and works. For, in like manner, as any person,
when he sees a ship on the sea rigged and in sail, and making for the
harbour, will no doubt infer that there is a pilot in her who is
steering her; so we must perceive that God is the governor \[pilot\] of
the whole universe, though He be not visible to the eyes of the flesh,
since He is incomprehensible. For if a man cannot look upon the sun,
though it be a very small heavenly body, on account of its exceeding
heat and power, how shall not a mortal man be much more unable to face
the glory of God, which is unutterable? For as the pomegranate, with the
rind containing it, has within it many cells and compartments which are
separated by tissues, and has also many seeds dwelling in it, so the
whole creation is contained by the spirit <span
id="fr_531"></span>[532](#fn_531.md) of God, and the containing spirit is
along with the creation contained by the hand of God. As, therefore, the
seed of the pomegranate, dwelling inside, cannot see what is outside the
rind, itself being within; so neither can man, who along with the whole
creation is enclosed by the hand of God, behold God. Then again, an
earthly king is believed to exist, even though he be not seen by all;
for he is recognised by his laws and ordinances, and authorities, and
forces, and statues; and are you unwilling that God should be recognised
by His works and mighty deeds?
