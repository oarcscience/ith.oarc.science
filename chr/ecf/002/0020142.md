##### <span id="iv.ii.iii.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.—Philosophers Inculcate Cannibalism.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.v-p1"></span>Since, then, you have read much, what
is your opinion of the precepts of Zeno, and Diogenes, and Cleanthes,
which their books contain, inculcating the eating of human flesh: that
fathers be cooked and eaten by their own children; and that if any one
refuse or reject a part of this infamous food, he himself be devoured
who will riot eat? An utterance even more godless than these is
found,—that, namely, of Diogenes, who teaches children to bring their
own parents in sacrifice, and devour them. And does not the historian
Herodotus narrate that Cambyses, <span id="fr_640"></span>[641](#fn_640.md)
when he had slaughtered the children of Harpagus, cooked them also, and
set them as a meal before their father? And, still further, he narrates
that among the Indians the parents are eaten by their own children. Oh!
the godless teaching of those who recorded, yea, rather, inculcated such
things! Oh! their wickedness and godlessness! Oh! the conception of
those who thus accurately philosophized, and profess philosophy! For
they who taught these doctrines have filled the world with iniquity.

did this; see Herod. i. 119.
