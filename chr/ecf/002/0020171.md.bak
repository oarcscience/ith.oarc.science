##### <span id="v.ii.i-p0.1"></span>Chapter I.—Injustice Shown Towards the Christians.

<span id="v.ii.i-p1"></span>In your empire, greatest of sovereigns,
different nations have different customs and laws; and no one is
hindered by law or fear of punishment from following his ancestral
usages, however ridiculous these may be. A citizen of Ilium calls Hector
a god, and pays divine honours to Helen, taking her for Adrasteia. The
Lacedæmonian venerates Agamemnon as Zeus, and Phylonoë the daughter of
Tyndarus; and the man of Tenedos worships Tennes. <span
id="fr_698"></span>[699](#fn_698.md) The Athenian sacrifices to Erechtheus
as Poseidon. The Athenians also perform religious rites and celebrate
mysteries in honour of Agraulus and Pandrosus, women who were deemed
guilty of impiety for opening the box. In short, among every nation and
people, men offer whatever sacrifices and celebrate whatever mysteries
they please. The Egyptians reckon among their gods even cats, and
crocodiles, and serpents, and asps, and dogs. And to all these both you
and the laws give permission so to act, deeming, on the one hand, that
to believe in no god at all is impious and wicked, and on the other,
that it is necessary for each man to worship the gods he prefers, in
order that through fear of the deity, men may be kept from wrong-doing.
But why—for do not, like the multitude, be led astray by hearsay—why is
a mere name odious to you? <span id="fr_699"></span>[700](#fn_699.md) Names
are not deserving of hatred: it is the unjust act that calls for penalty
and punishment. And accordingly, with admiration of your mildness and
gentleness, and your peaceful and benevolent disposition towards every
man, individuals live in the possession of equal rights; and the cities,
according to their rank, share in equal honour; and the whole empire,
under your intelligent sway, enjoys profound peace. But for us who are
called Christians <span id="fr_700"></span>[701](#fn_700.md) you have not
in like manner cared; but although we commit no wrong—nay, as will
appear in the sequel of this discourse, are of all men most piously and
righteously disposed towards the Deity and towards your government—you
allow us to be harassed, plundered, and persecuted, the multitude making
war upon us for our name alone. We venture, therefore, to lay a
statement of our case before you—and you will team from this discourse
that we suffer unjustly, and contrary to all law and reason—and we
beseech you to bestow some consideration upon us also, that we may cease
at length to be slaughtered at the instigation of false accusers. For
the fine imposed by our persecutors does not aim merely at our property,
nor their insults at our reputation, nor the damage they do us at any
other of our greater interests. These we hold in contempt, though to the
generality they appear matters of great importance; for we have learned,
not only not to return blow for blow, nor to go to law with those who
plunder and rob us, but to those who smite us on one side of the face to
offer the other side also, and to those who take away our coat to give
likewise our cloak. But, when we have surrendered our property, they
plot against our very bodies and souls, <span
id="fr_701"></span>[702](#fn_701.md) pouring <span id="page_130">p.
130</span> <span id="v.ii.i-Page_130"></span>upon us wholesale charges
of crimes of which we are guiltless even in thought, but which belong to
these idle praters themselves, and to the whole tribe of those who are
like them.

<span id="v.ii.i-p5"></span> \[For three centuries the faithful were
made witnesses for Jesus and the resurrection, even unto death; with
“spoiling of their goods,” not only, but dying daily, and “counted as
sheep for the slaughter.” What can refuse such testimony? They conquered
through suffering.

<span id="v.ii.i-p6"></span>The reader will be pleased with this
citation from an author, the neglect of whose heavenly writings is a sad
token of spiritual decline in the spirit of our religion:—

<span id="v.ii.i-p7"></span>“The Lord is sure of His designed advantages
out of the sufferings of His Church and of His saints for His name. He
loses nothing, and they lose nothing; but their enemies, when they rage
most and prevail most, are ever the greatest losers. His own glory
grows, the graces of His people grow; *yea, their very number grows*,
and that, sometimes, most by their greatest sufferings. This was evident
in the first ages of the Christian Church. Where were *the glory of so
much invincible love and patience*, if they had not been so put to it?”
Leighton, *Comm. on St. Peter*, Works, vol. iv. p. 478. West’s admirable
edition, London, Longmans, 1870.\]
