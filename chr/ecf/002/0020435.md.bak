##### <span id="vi.iv.viii.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.—Application of Demonstration to Sceptical Suspense of Judgment.

<span id="vi.iv.viii.v-p1"></span>Now the same treatment which applies
to demonstration applies also to the following question.

<span id="vi.iv.viii.v-p2"></span>Some, for instance, say that there
cannot be several originating causes for one animal. It is impossible
that there can be several homogeneous originating causes of an animal;
but that there should be several heterogeneous, is not absurd.

<span id="vi.iv.viii.v-p3"></span>Suppose the Pyrrhonian suspense of
judgment, as they say, \[the idea\] that nothing is certain: it is plain
that, beginning with itself, it first invalidates itself. It either
grants that something is true, that you are not to suspend your judgment
on all things; or it persists in saying that there is nothing true. And
it is evident, that first it will not be true. For it either affirms
what is true or it does not affirm what is true. But if it affirms what
is true, it concedes, though unwillingly, that something is true. And if
it does not affirm what is true, it leaves true what it wished to do
away with. For, in so far as the scepticism which demolishes is proved
false, in so far the positions which are being demolished, are proved
true; like the dream which says that all dreams are false. For in
confuting itself, it is confirmatory of the others.

<span id="vi.iv.viii.v-p4"></span>And, in fine, if it is true, it will
make a beginning with itself, and not be scepticism of anything else but
of itself first. Then if \[such a man\] apprehends that he is a man, or
that he is sceptical, it is evident that he is not sceptical. <span
id="fr_3707"></span>[3708](#fn_3707.md) And how shall he reply to the
interrogation? For he is evidently no sceptic in respect to this. Nay,
he affirms even that he does doubt.

<span id="vi.iv.viii.v-p6"></span>And if we must be persuaded to suspend
our judgment in regard to everything, we shall first suspend our
judgment in regard to our suspense of judgment itself, whether we are to
credit it or not.

<span id="vi.iv.viii.v-p7"></span>And if this position is true, that we
do not know what is true, then absolutely nothing is allowed to be true
by it. But if he will say that even this is questionable, whether we
know what is true; by this very statement he grants that truth is
knowable, in the very act of appearing to establish the doubt respecting
it.

<span id="vi.iv.viii.v-p8"></span>But if a philosophical sect is a
leaning toward dogmas, or, according to some, a leaning to a number of
dogmas which have consistency with one another and with phenomena,
tending to a right life; and dogma is a logical conception, and
conception is a state and assent of the mind: not merely sceptics, but
every one who dogmatizes is accustomed in certain things to suspend his
judgment, either through want of strength of mind, or want of clearness
in the things, or equal force in the reasons.

guard as to the philosophical *scepticism* here treated, which is not
the habit of *unbelief* commonly so called.\]
