##### <span id="vi.iv.i.xxiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXIII.—The Age, Birth, and Life of Moses.

<span id="vi.iv.i.xxiii-p1"></span>Moses, originally of a Chaldean <span
id="fr_2097"></span>[2098](#fn_2097.md) family, was born in Egypt, his
ancestors having migrated from Babylon into Egypt on account of a
protracted famine. Born in the seventh generation, <span
id="fr_2098"></span>[2099](#fn_2098.md) and having received a royal
education, the following are the circumstances of his history. The
Hebrews having increased in Egypt to a great multitude, and the king of
the country being afraid of insurrection in consequence of their
numbers, he ordered all the female children born to the Hebrews to be
reared (woman being unfit for war), but the male to be destroyed, being
suspicious of stalwart youth. But the child being goodly, his parents
nursed him secretly three months, natural affection being too strong for
the monarch’s cruelty. But at last, dreading lest they should be
destroyed along with the child, they made a basket of the papyrus that
grew there, put the child in it, and laid it on the banks of the marshy
river. The child’s sister stood at a distance, and watched what would
happen. In this emergency, the king’s daughter, who for a long time had
not been pregnant, and who longed for a child, came that day to the
river to bathe and wash herself; and hearing the child cry, she ordered
it to be brought to her; and touched with pity, sought a nurse. At that
moment the child’s sister ran up, and said that, if she wished, she
could procure for her as nurse one of the Hebrew women who had recently
had a child. And on her consenting and desiring her to do so, she
brought the child’s mother to be nurse for a stipulated fee, as if she
had been some other person. Thereupon the queen gave the babe the name
of Moses, with etymological propriety, from his being drawn out of “the
water,” <span id="fr_2099"></span>[2100](#fn_2099.md) —for the Egyptians
call water “mou,”—in which he had been exposed to die. For they call
Moses one who “who breathed \[on being taken\] from the water.” It is
clear that previously the parents gave a name to the child on his
circumcision; and he was called Joachim. And he had a third name in
heaven, after his ascension, <span id="fr_2100"></span>[2101](#fn_2100.md)
as the mystics say—Melchi. Having reached the proper age, he was taught
arithmetic, geometry, poetry, harmony, and besides, medicine and music,
by those that excelled in these arts among the Egyptians; and besides,
the philosophy which is conveyed by symbols, which they point out in the
hieroglyphical inscriptions. The rest of the usual course of
instruction, Greeks taught him in Egypt as a royal child, as Philo says
in his life of Moses. He learned, besides, the literature of the
Egyptians, and the knowledge of the heavenly bodies from the Chaldeans
and the Egyptians; whence in the Acts <span
id="fr_2101"></span>[2102](#fn_2101.md) he is said “to have been instructed
in all the wisdom of the Egyptians.” And Eupolemus, in his book *On the
Kings in Judea*, says that “Moses was the first wise man, and the first
that imparted grammar to the Jews, that the Phœnicians received it from
the Jews, and the Greeks from the Phœnicians.” And betaking himself to
their philosophy, <span id="fr_2102"></span>[2103](#fn_2102.md) he
increased his wisdom, being ardently attached to the training received
from his kindred and ancestors, till he struck and slew the Egyptian who
wrongfully attacked the Hebrew. And the mystics say that he slew the
Egyptian by a word only; as, certainly, Peter in the Acts is related to
have slain by speech those who appropriated part of the price of the
field, and lied. <span id="fr_2103"></span>[2104](#fn_2103.md) And so
Artapanus, in his work *On the Jews*, relates “that Moses, being shut up
in custody by Chenephres, king of the Egyptians, on account of the
people demanding to be let go from Egypt, the prison being opened by
night, by the interposition of God, went forth, and reaching the palace,
stood before the king as he slept, and aroused him; and that the latter,
struck with what had taken place, bade Moses tell him the name of the
God who had sent him; and that he, bending forward, told him in his ear;
and that the king on hearing it fell speechless, but being supported by
Moses, revived again.” And respecting the education of Moses, we shall
find a harmonious account in Ezekiel, <span
id="fr_2104"></span>[2105](#fn_2104.md) the composer of Jewish tragedies in
the drama entitled *The Exodus*. He thus writes in the person of Moses:—

> <span id="vi.iv.i.xxiii-p9.1"></span> “For, seeing our race abundantly
> increase,  
> His treacherous snares King Pharaoh ’gainst us laid,  
> And cruelly in brick-kilns some of us,  
> And some, in toilsome works of building, plagued.  
> And towns and towers by toil of ill-starred men  
> He raised. Then to the Hebrew race proclaimed,  
> That each male child should in deep-flowing Nile  
> Be drowned. My mother bore and hid me then  
> Three months (so afterwards she told). Then took,  
> And me adorned with fair array, and placed  
> On the deep sedgy marsh by Nilus bank,  
> While Miriam, my sister, watched afar.  
> Then, with her maids, the daughter of the king,  
> To bathe her beauty in the cleansing stream,  
> <span id="page_336">p. 336</span> <span
> id="vi.iv.i.xxiii-Page_336"></span> Came near, straight saw, and took
> and raised me up;  
> And knew me for a Hebrew. Miriam  
> My sister to the princess ran, and said,  
> ‘Is it thy pleasure, that I haste and find  
> A nurse for thee to rear this child  
> Among the Hebrew women?’ The princess  
> Gave assent. The maiden to her mother sped,  
> And told, who quick appeared. My own  
> Dear mother took me in her arms. Then said  
> The daughter of the king: ‘Nurse me this child,  
> And I will give thee wages.’And my name  
> Moses she called, because she drew and saved  
> Me from the waters on the river’s bank.  
> And when the days of childhood had flown by,  
> My mother brought me to the palace where  
> The princess dwelt, after disclosing all  
> About my ancestry, and God’s great gifts.  
> In boyhood’s years I royal nurture had,  
> And in all princely exercise was trained,  
> As if the princess’s very son. But when  
> The circling days had run their course,  
> I left the royal palace.”  

<span id="vi.iv.i.xxiii-p10"></span>Then, after relating the combat
between the Hebrew and the Egyptian, and the burying of the Egyptian in
the sand, he says of the other contest:—

> <span id="vi.iv.i.xxiii-p10.1"></span> “Why strike one feebler than
> thyself?  
> And he rejoined: Who made thee judge o’er us,  
> Or ruler? Wilt thou slay me, as thou didst  
> Him yesterday? And I in terror said,  
> How is this known?”  

<span id="vi.iv.i.xxiii-p11"></span>Then he fled from Egypt and fed
sheep, being thus trained beforehand for pastoral rule. For the
shepherd’s life is a preparation for sovereignty in the case of him who
is destined to rule over the peaceful flock of men, as the chase for
those who are by nature warlike. Thence God brought him to lead the
Hebrews. Then the Egyptians, oft admonished, continued unwise; and the
Hebrews were spectators of the calamities that others suffered, learning
in safety the power of God. And when the Egyptians gave no heed to the
effects of that power, through their foolish infatuation disbelieving,
then, as is said, “the children knew” what was done; and the Hebrews
afterwards going forth, departed carrying much spoil from the Egyptians,
not for avarice, as the cavillers say, for God did not persuade them to
covet what belonged to others. But, in the first place, they took wages
for the services they had rendered the Egyptians all the time; and then
in a way recompensed the Egyptians, by afflicting them in requital as
avaricious, by the abstraction of the booty, as they had done the
Hebrews by enslaving them. Whether, then, as may be alleged is done in
war, they thought it proper, in the exercise of the rights of
conquerors, to take away the property of their enemies, as those who
have gained the day do from those who are worsted (and there was just
cause of hostilities. The Hebrews came as suppliants to the Egyptians on
account of famine; and they, reducing their guests to slavery, compelled
them to serve them after the manner of captives, giving them no
recompense); or as in peace, took the spoil as wages against the will of
those who for a long period had given them no recompense, but rather had
robbed them, \[it is all one.\]
