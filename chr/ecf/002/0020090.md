##### <span id="iv.ii.i.vii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VII.—We Shall See God When We Put on Immortality.

<span id="iv.ii.i.vii-p1"></span>This is my God, the Lord of all, who
alone stretched out the heaven, and established the breadth of the earth
under it; who stirs the deep recesses of the sea, and makes its waves
roar; who rules its power, and stills the tumult of its waves; who
founded the earth upon the waters, and gave a spirit to nourish it;
whose breath giveth light to the whole, who, if He withdraw His breath,
the whole will utterly fail. By Him you speak, O man; His breath you
breathe yet Him you know not. And this is your condition, because of the
blindness of your soul, and the hardness of your heart. But, if you
will, you may be healed. Entrust yourself to the Physician, and He will
couch the eyes of your soul and of your heart. Who is the Physician?
God, who heals and makes alive through His word and wisdom. God by His
own word and wisdom made all things; for “by His word were the heavens
made, and all the host of them by the breath of His mouth.” <span
id="fr_535"></span>[536](#fn_535) Most excellent is His wisdom. By His
wisdom God founded the earth; and by knowledge He prepared the heavens;
and by understanding were the fountains of the great deep broken up, and
the clouds poured out their dews. If thou perceivest these things, O
man, living chastely, and holily, and righteously, thou canst see God.
But before all let faith and the fear of God have rule in thy heart, and
then shalt thou understand these things. When thou shalt have put off
the mortal, and put on incorruption, then shall thou see God worthily.
For God will raise thy flesh immortal with thy soul; and then, having
become immortal, thou shalt see the Immortal, if now you believe on Him;
and then you shall know that you have spoken unjustly against Him.
