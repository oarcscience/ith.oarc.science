##### <span id="vi.iv.i.xxvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXVII.—The Law, Even in Correcting and Punishing, Aims at the Good of Men.

<span id="vi.iv.i.xxvii-p1"></span>Let no, one then, run down law, as
if, on account of the penalty, it were not beautiful and good. For shall
he who drives away bodily disease appear a benefactor; and shall not he
who attempts to deliver the soul from iniquity, as much more appear a
friend, as the soul is a more precious thing than the body? Besides, for
the sake of bodily health we submit to incisions, and cauterizations,
and medicinal draughts; and he who administers them is called saviour
and healer, <span id="fr_2113"></span>[2114](#fn_2113) even though
amputating parts, not from grudge or ill-will towards the patient, but
as the principles of the art prescribe, so that the sound parts may not
perish along with them, and no one accuses the physician’s art of
wickedness; and shall we not similarly submit, for the soul’s sake, to
either banishment, or punishment, or bonds, provided only from
unrighteousness we shall attain to righteousness?

<span id="vi.iv.i.xxvii-p3"></span>For the law, in its solicitude for
those who obey, trains up to piety, and prescribes what is to be done,
and restrains each one from sins, imposing penalties even on lesser
sins.

<span id="vi.iv.i.xxvii-p4"></span>But when it sees any one in such a
condition as to appear incurable, posting to the last stage of
wickedness, then in its solicitude for the rest, that they may not be
destroyed by it (just as if amputating a part from the whole body), it
condemns such an one to death, as the course most conducive to health.
“Being judged by the Lord,” says the apostle, “we are chastened, that we
may not be condemned with the world.” <span
id="fr_2114"></span>[2115](#fn_2114) For the prophet had said before,
“Chastening, the <span class="sc"><span
id="vi.iv.i.xxvii-p5.2"></span>Lord</span> hath chastised me, but hath
not given me over unto death.” <span
id="fr_2115"></span>[2116](#fn_2115) “For in order to teach thee His
righteousness,” it is said, “He chastised thee and tried thee, and made
thee to hunger and thirst in the desert land; that all His statutes and
His judgments may be known in thy heart, as I command thee this day; and
that thou mayest know in thine heart, that just as if a man were
chastising his son, so the <span class="sc"><span
id="vi.iv.i.xxvii-p6.2"></span>Lord</span> our God shall chastise
thee.” <span id="fr_2116"></span>[2117](#fn_2116)

<span id="vi.iv.i.xxvii-p8"></span>And to prove that example corrects,
he says directly to the purpose: “A clever man, when he seeth the wicked
punished, will himself be severely chastised, for the fear of the Lord
is the source of wisdom.” <span id="fr_2117"></span>[2118](#fn_2117)

<span id="vi.iv.i.xxvii-p10"></span>But it is the highest and most
perfect good, when one is able to lead back any one from the practice of
evil to virtue and well-doing, which is the very function of the law. So
that, when one fails into any incurable evil,—when taken possession of,
for example, by wrong or covetousness,—it will be for his good if he is
put to death. For the law is beneficent, being able to make some
righteous from unrighteous, if they will only give ear to it, and by
releasing others from present evils; for those who have chosen <span
id="page_340">p. 340</span> <span id="vi.iv.i.xxvii-Page_340"></span>to
live temperately and justly, it conducts to immortality. To know the law
is characteristic of a good disposition. And again: “Wicked men do not
understand the law; but they who seek the <span class="sc"><span
id="vi.iv.i.xxvii-p10.1"></span>Lord</span> shall have understanding in
all that is good.” <span id="fr_2118"></span>[2119](#fn_2118)

<span id="vi.iv.i.xxvii-p12"></span>It is essential, certainly, that the
providence which manages all, be both supreme and good. For it is the
power of both that dispenses salvation—the one correcting by punishment,
as supreme, the other showing kindness in the exercise of beneficence,
as a benefactor. It is in your power not to be a son of disobedience,
but to pass from darkness to life, and lending your ear to wisdom, to be
the legal slave of God, in the first instance, and then to become a
faithful servant, fearing the Lord God. And if one ascend higher, he is
enrolled among the sons.

<span id="vi.iv.i.xxvii-p13"></span>But when “charity covers the
multitude of sins,” <span id="fr_2119"></span>[2120](#fn_2119) by the
consummation of the blessed hope, then may we welcome him as one who has
been enriched in love, and received into the elect adoption, which is
called the beloved of God, while he chants the prayer, saying, “Let the
Lord be my God.”

<span id="vi.iv.i.xxvii-p15"></span>The beneficent action of the law,
the apostle showed in the passage relating to the Jews, writing thus:
“Behold, thou art called a Jew and restest in the law, and makest thy
boast in God, and knowest the will of God, and approvest the things that
are more excellent, being instructed out of the law, and art confident
that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them who are in
darkness, an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, who hast the
form of knowledge and of truth in the law.” <span
id="fr_2120"></span>[2121](#fn_2120) For it is admitted that such is the
power of the law, although those whose conduct is not according to the
law, make a false pretence, as if they lived in the law. “Blessed is the
man that hath found wisdom, and the mortal who has seen understanding;
for out of its mouth,” manifestly Wisdom’s, “proceeds righteousness, and
it bears law and mercy on its tongue.” <span
id="fr_2121"></span>[2122](#fn_2121) For both the law and the Gospel are
the energy of one Lord, who is “the power and wisdom of God;” and the
terror which the law begets is merciful and in order to salvation. “Let
not alms, and faith, and truth fail thee, but hang them around thy
neck.” <span id="fr_2122"></span>[2123](#fn_2122) In the same way as
Paul, prophecy upbraids the people with not understanding the law.
“Destruction and misery are in their ways, and the way of peace have
they not known.” <span id="fr_2123"></span>[2124](#fn_2123) “There is no
fear of God before their eyes.” <span
id="fr_2124"></span>[2125](#fn_2124) “Professing themselves wise, they
became fools.” <span id="fr_2125"></span>[2126](#fn_2125) “And we know
that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully.” <span
id="fr_2126"></span>[2127](#fn_2126) “Desiring to be teachers of the
law, they understand,” says the apostle, “neither what they say, nor
whereof they affirm.” <span id="fr_2127"></span>[2128](#fn_2127) “Now
the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and a good
conscience, and faith unfeigned.” <span
id="fr_2128"></span>[2129](#fn_2128)
