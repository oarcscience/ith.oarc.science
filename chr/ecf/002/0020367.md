<span id="vi.iv.iv.xvi"></span>

##### <span id="vi.iv.iv.xvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVII.—Passages from Clement’s Epistle to the Corinthians on Martyrdom.

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xvi-p1"></span>Moreover, in the Epistle to the
Corinthians, the Apostle <span id="fr_2832"></span>[2833](#fn_2832.md)
Clement also, drawing a picture of the Gnostic, says: <span
id="fr_2833"></span>[2834](#fn_2833.md) “For who that has sojourned among
you has not proved your perfect and firm faith? and has not admired your
sound and gentle piety? and has not celebrated the munificent style of
your hospitality? and has not felicitated your complete and sure
knowledge? For ye did all things impartially, and walked in the
ordinances of God;” and so forth.

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xvi-p4"></span>Then more clearly: “Let us fix our
eyes on those who have yielded perfect service to His magnificent glory.
Let us take Enoch, who, being by his obedience found righteous, was
translated; and Noah, who, having believed, was saved; and Abraham, who
for his faith and hospitality was called the friend of God, and was the
father of Isaac.” “For hospitality and piety, Lot was saved from Sodom.”
“For faith and hospitality, Rahab the harlot was saved.” “From patience
and faith they walked about in goat-skins, and sheep-skins, and folds of
camels’ hair, proclaiming the kingdom of Christ. We name His prophets
Elias, and Eliseus, and Ezekiel, and John.”

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xvi-p5"></span>“For Abraham, who for his free faith
was called ‘the friend of God,’ was not elated by glory, but modestly
said, ‘I am dust and ashes.’ <span id="fr_2834"></span>[2835](#fn_2834.md)
And of Job it is thus written: ‘Job was just and blameless, true and
pious, abstaining from all evil.’” <span
id="fr_2835"></span>[2836](#fn_2835.md) He it was who overcame the tempter
by patience, and at once testified and was testified to by God; who
keeps hold of humility, and says, “No one is pure from defilement, not
even if his life were but for one day.” <span
id="fr_2836"></span>[2837](#fn_2836.md) “Moses, ‘the servant who was
faithful in all his house,’ said to Him who uttered the oracles from the
bush, ‘Who am I, that Thou sendest me? I am slow of speech, and of a
stammering tongue,’ to minister the voice of God in human speech. And
again: ‘I am smoke from a pot.’” “For <span id="page_429">p. 429</span>
<span id="vi.iv.iv.xvi-Page_429"></span>God resisteth the proud, but
giveth grace to the humble.” <span id="fr_2837"></span>[2838](#fn_2837.md)

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xvi-p10"></span>“David too, of whom the Lord,
testifying, says, ‘I found a man after my own heart, David the son of
Jesse. With my holy oil I anointed him.’ <span
id="fr_2838"></span>[2839](#fn_2838.md) But he also says to God, ‘Pity me,
O God, according to Thy mercy; and according to the multitude of Thy
tender mercies, blot out my transgression. Wash me thoroughly from mine
iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin. For I know my transgression, and
my sin is ever before me.’” <span id="fr_2839"></span>[2840](#fn_2839.md)
Then, alluding to sin which is not subject to the law, in the exercise
of the moderation of true knowledge, he adds, “Against Thee only have I
sinned, and done evil in Thy sight.” <span
id="fr_2840"></span>[2841](#fn_2840.md) For the Scripture somewhere says,
“The Spirit of the Lord is a lamp, searching the recesses of the
belly.” <span id="fr_2841"></span>[2842](#fn_2841.md) And the more of a
Gnostic a man becomes by doing right, the nearer is the illuminating
Spirit to him. “Thus the Lord draws near to the righteous, and none of
the thoughts and reasonings of which we are the authors escape Him—I
mean the Lord Jesus,” the scrutinizer by His omnipotent will of our
heart, “whose blood was consecrated <span
id="fr_2842"></span>[2843](#fn_2842.md) for us. Let us therefore respect
those who are over us, and reverence the elders; let us honour the
young, and let us teach the discipline of God.” For blessed is he who
shall do and teach the Lord’s commands worthily; and he is of a
magnanimous mind, and of a mind contemplative of truth. “Let us direct
our wives to what is good; let them exhibit,” says he, “the lovable
disposition of chastity; let them show the guileless will of their
meekness; let them manifest the gentleness of their tongue by silence;
let them give their love not according to their inclinations, but equal
love in sanctity to all that fear God. Let our children share in the
discipline that is in Christ; let them learn what humility avails before
God; what is the power of holy love before God, how lovely and great is
the fear of the Lord, saving all that walk in it holily; with a pure
heart: for He is the Searcher of the thoughts and sentiments, whose
breath is in us, and when He wills He will take it away.”

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xvi-p16"></span>“Now all those things are confirmed
by the faith that is in Christ.‘Come, ye children,’ says the Lord,
‘hearken to me, and I will teach you the fear of the Lord. Who is the
man that desireth life, that loveth to see good days? ’ <span
id="fr_2843"></span>[2844](#fn_2843.md) Then He subjoins the gnostic
mystery of the numbers seven and eight.‘Stop thy tongue from evil, and
thy lips from speaking guile. Depart from evil, and do good. Seek peace,
and pursue it.’ <span id="fr_2844"></span>[2845](#fn_2844.md) For in these
words He alludes to knowledge (*gnosis*), with abstinence from evil and
the doing of what is good, teaching that it is to be perfected by word
and deed. ‘The eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, and His ears are
to their prayer. But the face of God is against those that do evil, to
root out their memory from the earth. The righteous cried, and the Lord
heard, and delivered him out of all his distresses.’ <span
id="fr_2845"></span>[2846](#fn_2845.md) ‘Many are the stripes of sinners;
but those who hope in the Lord, mercy shall compass about.’” <span
id="fr_2846"></span>[2847](#fn_2846.md) “A multitude of mercy,” he nobly
says, “surrounds him that trusts in the Lord.”

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xvi-p21"></span>For it is written in the Epistle to
the Corinthians, “Through Jesus Christ our foolish and darkened mind
springs up to the light. By Him the Sovereign Lord wished us to taste
the knowledge that is immortal.” And, showing more expressly the
peculiar nature of knowledge, he added: “These things, then, being clear
to us, looking into the depths of divine knowledge, we ought to do all
things in order which the Sovereign Lord commanded us to perform at the
appointed seasons. Let the wise man, then, show his wisdom not in words
only, but in good deeds. Let the humble not testify to himself, but
allow testimony to be borne to him by another. Let not him who is pure
in the flesh boast, knowing that it is another who furnishes him with
continence. Ye see, brethren, that the more we are subjected to peril,
the more knowledge are we counted worthy of.”
