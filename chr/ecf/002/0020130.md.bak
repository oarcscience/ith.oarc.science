##### <span id="iv.ii.ii.xxxii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXII.—How the Human Race Was Dispersed.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xxxii-p1"></span>Hence, therefore, may the loves of
learning and of antiquity understand the history, and see that those
things are recent which are told by us apart from the holy
prophets. <span id="fr_615"></span>[616](#fn_615.md) For though at first
there were few men in the land of Arabia and Chaldæa, yet, after their
languages were divided, they gradually began to multiply and spread over
all the earth; and some of them tended towards the east to dwell there,
and others to the parts of the great continent, and others northwards,
so as to extend as far as Britain, in the Arctic regions. And others
went to the land of Canaan, which is called Judæa, and Phœnicia, and the
region of Ethiopia, and Egypt, and Libya, and the country called torrid,
and the parts stretching towards the west; and the rest went to places
by the sea, and Pamphylia, and Asia, and Greece, and Macedonia, and,
besides, to Italy, and the whole country called Gaul, and Spain, and
Germany; so that now the whole world is thus filled with inhabitants.
Since then the occupation of the world by men was at first in three
divisions,—in the east, and south, and west: afterwards, the remaining
parts of the earth were inhabited, when men became very numerous. And
the writers, not knowing these things, are forward to maintain that the
world is shaped like a sphere, and to compare it to a cube. But how can
they say what is true regarding these things, when they do not know
about the creation of the world and its population? Men gradually
increasing in number and multiplying on the earth, as we have already
said, the islands also of the sea and the rest of the countries were
inhabited.

by showing that no recent occurrences are mentioned in it. Wolf,
however, gives another reading, which would be rendered, “understand
whether those things are recent which we utter on the authority of the
holy prophets.”
