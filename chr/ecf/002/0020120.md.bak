##### <span id="iv.ii.ii.xxii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXII.—Why God is Said to Have Walked.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xxii-p1"></span>You will say, then, to me: “You said
that God ought not to be contained in a place, and how do you now say
that He walked in Paradise?” Hear what I say. The God and Father,
indeed, of all cannot be contained, and is not found in a place, for
there is no place of His rest; but His Word, through whom He made all
things, being His power and His wisdom, assuming the person <span
id="fr_593"></span>[594](#fn_593.md) of the Father and Lord of all, went to
the garden in the person of God, and conversed with Adam. For the divine
writing itself teaches us that Adam said that he had heard the voice.
But what else is this voice but the Word of God, who is also His Son?
Not as the poets and writers of myths talk of the sons of gods begotten
from intercourse \[with women\], but as truth expounds, the Word, that
always exists, residing within the heart of God. For before anything
came into being He had Him as a counsellor, being His own mind and
thought. But when God wished to make all that He determined on, He begot
this Word, uttered, <span id="fr_594"></span>[595](#fn_594.md) the
first-born of all creation, not Himself being emptied of the Word
\[Reason\], but having begotten Reason, and always conversing with His
Reason. And hence the holy writings teach us, and all the spirit-bearing
\[inspired\] men, one of whom, John, says, “In the beginning was the
Word, and the Word was with God,” <span
id="fr_595"></span>[596](#fn_595.md) showing that at first God was alone,
and the Word in Him. Then he says, “The Word was God; all things came
into existence through Him; and apart from Him not one thing came into
existence.” The Word, then, being God, and being naturally <span
id="fr_596"></span>[597](#fn_596.md) produced from God, whenever the Father
of the universe wills, He sends Him to any place; and He, coming, is
both heard and seen, being sent by Him, and is found in a place.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xxii-p2"></span> The annotators here warn us against
supposing that “person” is used as it was afterwards employed in
discussing the doctrine of the Trinity, and show that the word is used
in its original meaning, and with reference to an actor taking up a mask
and personating a character.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xxii-p3"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.ii.ii.xxii-p3.1"></span>Προφορικός</span>, the term used of the
Logos as manifested; the Word as uttered by the Father, in distinction
from the Word immanent in Him. \[Theophilus is the first author who
distinguishes between the *Logos* <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.ii.ii.xxii-p3.2"></span>ἐνδιάθετος</span> (cap. x, *supra*) and
the *Logos* <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.ii.ii.xxii-p3.3"></span>προφορικός</span>; the Word *internal*,
and the Word emitted. Kaye’s *Justin*, p. 171.\]
