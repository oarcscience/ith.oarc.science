##### <span id="iv.ii.i.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.—God is Known by His Works.

<span id="iv.ii.i.vi-p1"></span>Consider, O man, His works,—the timely
rotation of the seasons, and the changes of temperature; the regular
march of the stars; the well-ordered course of days and nights, and
months, and years; the various beauty of seeds, and plants, and fruits;
and the divers species <span id="fr_532"></span>[533](#fn_532) of
quadrupeds, and birds, and reptiles, and fishes, both of the rivers and
of the sea; or consider the instinct implanted in these animals to beget
and rear offspring, not for their own profit, but for the use of man;
and the providence with which God provides nourishment for all flesh, or
the subjection in which He has ordained that all things subserve
mankind. Consider, too, the flowing of sweet fountains and never-failing
rivers, and the seasonable supply of dews, and showers, and rains; the
manifold movement of the heavenly bodies, the morning star rising and
heralding the approach of the perfect luminary; and the constellation of
Pleiades, and Orion, and Arcturus, and the orbit of the other stars that
circle through the heavens, all of which the manifold wisdom of <span
id="page_91">p. 91</span> <span id="iv.ii.i.vi-Page_91"></span>God has
called by names of their own. He is God alone who made light out of
darkness, and brought forth light from His treasures, and formed the
chambers of the south wind, <span id="fr_533"></span>[534](#fn_533) and
the treasure-houses of the deep, and the bounds of the seas, and the
treasuries of snows and hail-storms, collecting the waters in the
storehouses of the deep, and the darkness in His treasures, and bringing
forth the sweet, and desirable, and pleasant light out of His treasures;
“who causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth: He maketh
lightnings for the rain;” <span id="fr_534"></span>[535](#fn_534) who
sends forth His thunder to terrify, and foretells by the lightning the
peal of the thunder, that no soul may faint with the sudden shock; and
who so moderates the violence of the lightning as it flashes out of
heaven, that it does not consume the earth; for, if the lightning were
allowed all its power, it would burn up the earth; and were the thunder
allowed all its power, it would overthrow all the works that are
therein.
