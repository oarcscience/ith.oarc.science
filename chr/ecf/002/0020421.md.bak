##### <span id="vi.iv.vii.xi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XI.—Description of the Gnostic’s Life.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xi-p1"></span>Respecting the universe, he conceives
truly and grandly in virtue of his reception of divine teaching.
Beginning, then, with admiration of the Creation, and affording of
himself a proof of his capability for receiving knowledge, he becomes a
ready pupil of the Lord. Directly on hearing of God and Providence, he
believed in consequence of the admiration he entertained. Through the
power of impulse thence derived he devotes his energies in every way to
learning, doing all those things by means of which he shall be able to
acquire the knowledge of what he desires. And desire blended with
inquiry arises as faith advances. And this is to become worthy of
speculation, of such a character, and such importance. So shall the
Gnostic taste of the will of God. For it is not his ears, but his soul,
that he yields up to the things signified by what is spoken.
Accordingly, apprehending essences and things through the words, he
brings his soul, as is fit, to what is essential; apprehending (e.g.) in
the peculiar way in which they are spoken to the Gnostic, the commands,
“Do not commit adultery,” “Do not kill;” and not as they are understood
by other people. <span id="fr_3597"></span>[3598](#fn_3597.md) Training
himself, then, in scientific speculation, he proceeds to exercise
himself in larger generalizations and grander propositions; knowing
right well that “He that teacheth man knowledge,” according to the
prophet, is the Lord, the Lord acting by man’s mouth. So also He assumed
flesh.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xi-p3"></span>As is right, then, he never prefers
the pleasant to the useful; not even if a beautiful woman were to entice
him, when overtaken by circumstances, by wantonly urging him: since
Joseph’s master’s wife was not able to seduce him from his stedfastness;
but as she violently held his coat, divested himself of it,—becoming
bare of sin, but clothed with seemliness of character. For if the eyes
of the master—the Egyptian, I mean—saw not Joseph, yet those of the
Almighty looked on. For we hear the voice, and see the bodily forms; but
God scrutinizes the thing itself, from which the speaking and the
looking proceed.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xi-p4"></span>Consequently, therefore, though
disease, and accident, and what is most terrible of all, death, come
upon the Gnostic, he remains inflexible in soul,—knowing that all such
things are a necessity of creation, and that, also by the power of God,
they become the medicine of salvation, benefiting by discipline those
who are difficult to reform; allotted according to desert, by
Providence, which is truly good.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xi-p5"></span>Using the creatures, then, when the
Word prescribes, and to the extent it prescribes, in the exercise of
thankfulness to the Creator, he becomes master of the enjoyment of them.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xi-p6"></span>He never cherishes resentment or
harbours a grudge against any one, though deserving of hatred for his
conduct. For he worships the Maker, and loves him, who shares life,
pitying and praying for him on account of his ignorance. He indeed
partakes of the affections of the body, to which, susceptible as it is
of suffering by nature, he is bound. But in sensation he is not the
primary subject of it.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xi-p7"></span>Accordingly, then, in involuntary
circumstances, by withdrawing himself from troubles to the things which
really belong to him, he is not carried away with what is foreign to
him. And it is only to things that are necessary for him that he
accommodates himself, in so far as the soul is preserved unharmed. For
it is not in supposition or seeming that he wishes to be faithful; but
in knowledge and truth, that is, in sure deed and effectual word. <span
id="fr_3598"></span>[3599](#fn_3598.md) Wherefore he not only praises what
is noble, but endeavours himself to be noble; changing by love from a
good and faithful servant into a friend, through the perfection of
habit, which he has acquired in purity from true instruction and great
discipline.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xi-p9"></span>Striving, then, to attain to the
summit of knowledge (*gnosis*); decorous in character; composed in mien;
possessing all those advantages which belong to the true Gnostic; fixing
his eye on fair models, on the many patriarchs who have lived rightly,
and on very many prophets and angels reckoned without number, and above
all, on the Lord, who taught and showed it to be possible for him to
attain that highest life of all,—he therefore loves not all the good
things of the world, which are within <span id="page_541">p. 541</span>
<span id="vi.iv.vii.xi-Page_541"></span>his grasp, that he may not
remain on the ground, but the things hoped for, or rather already known,
being hoped for so as to be apprehended.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xi-p10"></span>So then he undergoes toils, and
trials, and afflictions, not as those among the philosophers who are
endowed with manliness, in the hope of present troubles ceasing, and of
sharing again in what is pleasant; but knowledge has inspired him with
the firmest persuasion of receiving the hopes of the future. Wherefore
he contemns not alone the pains of this world, but all its pleasures.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xi-p11"></span>They say, accordingly, that the
blessed Peter, on seeing his wife led to death, rejoiced on account of
her call and conveyance home, and called very encouragingly and
comfortingly, addressing her by name, “Remember thou the Lord.” Such was
the marriage of the blessed and their perfect disposition towards those
dearest to them. <span id="fr_3599"></span>[3600](#fn_3599.md)

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xi-p13"></span>Thus also the apostle says, “that he
who marries should be as though he married not,” <span
id="fr_3600"></span>[3601](#fn_3600.md) and deem his marriage free of
inordinate affection, and inseparable from love to the Lord; to which
the true husband exhorted his wife to cling on her departure out of this
life to the Lord.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xi-p15"></span>Was not then faith in the hope after
death conspicuous in the case of those who gave thanks to God even in
the very extremities of their punishments? For firm, in my opinion, was
the faith they possessed, which was followed by works of faith.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xi-p16"></span>In all circumstances, then, is the
soul of the Gnostic strong, in a condition of extreme health and
strength, like the body of an athlete.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xi-p17"></span>For he is prudent in human affairs,
in judging what ought to be done by the just man; having obtained the
principles from God from above, and having acquired, in order to the
divine resemblance, moderation in bodily pains and pleasures. And he
struggles against fears boldly, trusting in God. Certainly, then, the
gnostic soul, adorned with perfect virtue, is the earthly image of the
divine power; its development being the joint result of nature, of
training, of reason, all together. This beauty of the soul becomes a
temple of the Holy Spirit, when it acquires a disposition in the whole
of life corresponding to the Gospel. Such an one consequently withstands
all fear of everything terrible, not only of death, but also poverty and
disease, and ignominy, and things akin to these; being unconquered by
pleasure, and lord over irrational desires. For he well knows what is
and what is not to be done; being perfectly aware what things are really
to be dreaded, and what not. Whence he bears intelligently what the Word
intimates to him to be requisite and necessary; intelligently
discriminating what is really safe (that is, good), from what appears
so; and things to be dreaded from what seems so, such as death, disease,
and poverty; which are rather so in opinion than in truth.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xi-p18"></span>This is the really good man, who is
without passions; having, through the habit or disposition of the soul
endued with virtue, transcended the whole life of passion. He has
everything dependent on himself for the attainment of the end. For those
accidents which are called terrible are not formidable to the good man,
because they are not evil. And those which are really to be dreaded are
foreign to the gnostic Christian, being diametrically opposed to what is
good, because evil; and it is impossible for contraries to meet in the
same person at the same time. He, then, who faultlessly acts the drama
of life which God has given him to play, knows both what is to be done
and what is to be endured.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xi-p19"></span>Is it not then from ignorance of what
is and what is not to be dreaded that cowardice arises? Consequently the
only man of courage is the Gnostic, who knows both present and future
good things; along with these, knowing, as I have said, also the things
which are in reality not to be dreaded. Because, knowing vice alone to
be hateful, and destructive of what contributes to knowledge, protected
by the armour of the Lord, he makes war against it.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xi-p20"></span>For if anything is caused through
folly, and the operation or rather co-operation of the devil, this thing
is not straightway the devil or folly. For no action is wisdom. For
wisdom is a habit. And no action is a habit. The action, then, that
arises from ignorance, is not already ignorance, but an evil through
ignorance, but not ignorance. For neither perturbations of mind nor sins
are vices, though proceeding from vice.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xi-p21"></span>No one, then, who is irrationally
brave is a Gnostic; <span id="fr_3601"></span>[3602](#fn_3601.md) since one
might call children brave, who, through ignorance of what is to be
dreaded, undergo things that are frightful. So they touch fire even. And
the wild beasts that rush close on the points of spears, having a brute
courage, might be called valiant. And such people might perhaps call
jugglers valiant, who tumble on swords with a certain dexterity,
practising a mischievous art for sorry gain. But he who is truly brave,
with the peril arising from the bad feeling of the multitude before his
eyes, courageously awaits whatever comes. In this way he is
distinguished <span id="page_542">p. 542</span> <span
id="vi.iv.vii.xi-Page_542"></span>from others that are called martyrs,
inasmuch as some furnish occasions for themselves, and rush into the
heart of dangers, I know not how (for it is right to use mild language);
while they, in accordance with right reason, protect themselves; then,
on God really calling them, promptly surrender themselves, and confirm
the call, from being conscious of no precipitancy, and present the man
to be proved in the exercise of true rational fortitude. Neither, then,
enduring lesser dangers from fear of greater, like other people, nor
dreading censure at the hands of their equals, and those of like
sentiments, do they continue in the confession of their calling; but
from love to God they willingly obey the call, with no other aim in view
than pleasing God, and not for the sake of the reward of their toils.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xi-p23"></span>For some suffer from love of glory,
and others from fear of some other sharper punishment, and others for
the sake of pleasures and delights after death, being children in faith;
blessed indeed, but not yet become men in love to God, as the Gnostic
is. For there are, as in the gymnastic contests, so also in the Church,
crowns for men and for children. But love is to be chosen for itself,
and for nothing else. Therefore in the Gnostic, along with knowledge,
the perfection of fortitude is developed from the discipline of life, he
having always studied to acquire mastery over the passions.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xi-p24"></span>Accordingly, love makes its own
athlete fearless and dauntless, and confident in the Lord, anointing and
training him; as righteousness secures for him truthfulness in his whole
life. <span id="fr_3602"></span>[3603](#fn_3602.md) For it was a compendium
of righteousness to say, “Let your yea be yea; and your nay, nay.” <span
id="fr_3603"></span>[3604](#fn_3603.md)

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xi-p27"></span>And the same holds with self-control.
For it is neither for love of honour, as the athletes for the sake of
crowns and fame; nor on the other hand, for love of money, as some
pretend to exercise self-control, pursuing what is good with terrible
suffering. Nor is it from love of the body for the sake of health. Nor
any more is any man who is temperate from rusticity, who has not tasted
pleasures, truly a man of self-control. Certainly those who have led a
laborious life, on tasting pleasures, forthwith break down the
inflexibility of temperance into pleasures. Such are they who are
restrained by law and fear. For on finding a favourable opportunity they
defraud the law, by giving what is good the slip. But self-control,
desirable for its own sake, perfected through knowledge, abiding ever,
makes the man lord and master of himself; so that the Gnostic is
temperate and passionless, incapable of being dissolved by pleasures and
pains, as they say adamant is by fire.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xi-p28"></span>The cause of these, then, is love, of
all science the most sacred and most sovereign.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xi-p29"></span>For by the service of what is best
and most exalted, which is characterized by unity, it renders the
Gnostic at once friend and son, having in truth grown “a perfect man, up
to the measure of full stature.” <span
id="fr_3604"></span>[3605](#fn_3604.md)

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xi-p31"></span>Further, agreement in the same thing
is consent. But what is the same is one. And friendship is consummated
in likeness; the community lying in oneness. The Gnostic, consequently,
in virtue of being a lover of the one true God, is the really perfect
man and friend of God, and is placed in the rank of son. For these are
names of nobility and knowledge, and perfection in the contemplation of
God; which crowning step of advancement the gnostic soul receives, when
it has become quite pure, reckoned worthy to behold everlastingly God
Almighty, “face,” it is said, “to face.” For having become wholly
spiritual, and having in the spiritual Church gone to what is of kindred
nature, it abides in the rest of God.
