### <span id="v.i-p0.1"></span>Introductory Note

#### <span id="v.i-p0.2"></span>to the

## <span id="v.i-p0.3"></span>Writings of Athenagoras

<span id="v.i-p1"></span>\[Translated by the Rev. B. P. Pratten.\]

<span id="v.i-p2"></span>\[<span class="sc"><span
id="v.i-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> 177.\] In placing Athenagoras here,
somewhat out of the order usually accepted, I commit no appreciable
violence against chronology, and I gain a great advantage for the
reader. To some extent we must recognise, in collocation, the principles
of affinity and historic growth. Closing up the bright succession of the
earlier Apologists, this favourite author affords also a fitting
introduction to the great founder of the Alexandrian School, who comes
next into view. His work opens the way for Clement’s elaboration of
Justin’s claim, that the whole of philosophy is embraced in
Christianity. It is charming to find the primal fountains of Christian
thought uniting here, to flow on for ever in the widening and deepening
channel of Catholic orthodoxy, as it gathers into itself all human
culture, and enriches the world with products of regenerated mind,
harvested from its overflow into the fields of philosophy and poetry and
art and science. More of this when we come to Clement, that man of
genius who introduced Christianity to itself, as reflected in the
burnished mirror of his intellect. Shackles are falling from the
persecuted and imprisoned faculties of the faithful, and soon the Faith
is to speak out, no more in tones of apology, but as mistress of the
human mind, and its pilot to new worlds of discovery and broad domains
of conquest. All hail the freedom with which, henceforth, Christians are
to assume the overthrow of heathenism as a foregone conclusion. The
distasteful exposure of heresies was the inevitable task after the first
victory. It was the chase and following-up of the adversary in his
limping and cowardly retreat, “the scattering of the rear of darkness.”
With Athenagoras, we touch upon tokens of things to come; we see
philosophy yoked to the chariot of Messiah; we begin to realize that
sibylline surrender of outworn Paganism, and its forecast of an era of
light:—

> <span id="v.i-p2.2"></span> “Magnus ab integro sæclorum nascitur
> ordo,  
> . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . quo ferrea primum  
> Desinet, ac toto surget gens aurea mundo.”  

<span id="v.i-p3"></span>In Athenagoras, whose very name is a
retrospect, we discover a remote result of St. Paul’s speech on Mars
Hill. The apostle had cast his bread upon the waters of Ilissus and
Cephisus to find it after many days. “When they heard of the
resurrection of the dead, some mocked;” but here comes a philosopher,
from the Athenian *agora*, a convert to St. Paul’s argument in his
Epistle to the Corinthians, confessing “the unknown God,” demolishing
the marble mob of deities that so “stirred the apostle’s spirit within
him,” and teaching alike the Platonist and the Stoic to sit at the feet
of Jesus. “Dionysius the Areopagite, and the woman named Damaris,” are
no longer to be despised as the scanty first-fruits of Attica. They too
have found a voice in this splendid trophy of the Gospel; and, “being
dead, they yet speak” through him.

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span> <span id="v.i-Page_126"></span>

<span id="v.i-p4"></span>To the meagre facts of his biography, which
appear below, there is nothing to be added; <span
id="fr_693"></span>[694](#fn_693.md) and I shall restrain my disposition to
be a commentator, within the limits of scanty notations. In the notes to
Tatian and Theophilus, I have made the student acquainted with that
useful addition to his treatise on *Justin Martyr*, in which the able
and judicious Bishop Kaye harmonizes those authors with Justin. The same
harmony enfolds the works of Athenagoras, <span
id="fr_694"></span>[695](#fn_694.md) and thus affords a synopsis of
Christian teaching under the Antonines; in which precision of
theological language is yet unattained, but identity of faith is clearly
exhibited. While the Germans are furnishing the scholar with critical
editions of the ancients, invaluable for their patient accumulations of
fact and illustration, they are so daring in theory and conjecture when
they come to exposition, that one enjoys the earnest and wholesome tone
of sober comment that distinguishes the English theologian. It has the
great merit of being inspired by profound sympathy with primitive
writers, and unadulterated faith in the Scriptures. Too often a German
critic treats one of these venerable witnesses, who yet live and yet
speak, as if they were dead subjects on the dissecting-table. They cut
and carve with anatomical display, and use the microscope with
scientific skill; but, oh! how frequently they surrender the saints of
God as mere corpses, into the hands of those who count them victims of a
blind faith in a dead Christ.

<span id="v.i-p7"></span>It will not be necessary, after my quotations
from Kaye in the foregoing sheets, to do more than indicate similar
illustrations of Athenagoras to be found in his pages. The dry version
often requires lubrications of devoutly fragrant exegesis; and
providentially they are at hand in that elaborate but modest work, of
which even this generation should not be allowed to lose sight.

<span id="v.i-p8"></span>The annotations of Conrad Gesner and Henry
Stephans would have greatly enriched this edition, had I been permitted
to enlarge the work by adding a version of them. They are often curious,
and are supplemented by the interesting letter of Stephans to Peter
Nannius, “the eminent pillar of Louvain,” on the earliest copies of
Athenagoras, from which modern editions have proceeded. The Paris
edition of Justin Marty (1615) contains these notes, as well as the
Greek of Tatian, Theophilus, and Athenagoras, with a Latin rendering. As
Bishop Kaye constantly refers to this edition, I have considered myself
fortunate in possessing it; using it largely in comparing his learned
comments with the Edinburgh Version.

<span id="v.i-p9"></span>A few words as to the noble treatise of our
author, on the Resurrection. As a firm and loving voice to this keynote
of Christian faith, it rings like an anthem through all the variations
of his thought and argument. Comparing his own blessed hope with the
delusions of a world lying in wickedness, and looking stedfastly to the
life of the world to come, what a sublime contrast we find in this
figure of Christ’s witness to the sensual life of the heathen, and even
to the groping wisdom of the Attic sages. I think this treatise a sort
of growth from the mind of one who had studied in the Academe, pitying
yet loving poor Socrates and his disciples. Yet more, it is the outcome
of meditation on that sad history in the Acts, which expounds St. Paul’s
bitter reminiscences, when he says that his gospel was, “to the Greeks,
foolishness.” They never “heard him again on this matter.” He left them
under the confused impressions they had expressed in the *agora*, when
they said, “he seemeth to be a setter-forth of new gods.” St. Luke
allows himself a smile only half suppressed when he adds, “because he
preached unto them *Jesus and Anastasis*,” which in their ears was only
a barbarian echo to their own *Phœbus and Artemis;* and what did
Athenians want of any more wares of that sort, especially under the
introduction of a poor Jew from parts unknown? Did the apostle’s
prophetic soul foresee Athenagoras, as he “departed from among them”?
However that may be, his blessed Master “knew what he would do.” He
could let none of Paul’s words fall to the ground, without taking care
that some seeds should bring forth fruit a thousand-fold. Here come the
sheaves at last. Athenagoras proves, also, what our Saviour meant, when
he said to the Galileans, “Ye are the light of the world.”

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span> <span id="v.i-Page_127"></span>

<span id="v.i-p10"></span>The following is the original <span
class="sc"><span id="v.i-p10.1"></span>Introductory Notice</span>:—

<span id="v.i-p11"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="v.i-p11.1"></span>It</span> is one of the most singular facts in
early ecclesiastical history, that the name of Athenagoras is scarcely
ever mentioned. Only two references to him and his writings have been
discovered. One of these occurs in the work of Methodius, *On the
Resurrection of the Body*, as preserved by Epiphanius (*Hœr*., lxiv.)
and Photius (*Biblioth*., ccxxxiv.). The other notice of him is found in
the writings <span id="fr_695"></span>[696](#fn_695.md) of Philip of Side,
in Pamphylia, who flourished in the early part of the fifth century. It
is very remarkable that Eusebius should have been altogether silent
regarding him; and that writings, so elegant and powerful as are those
which still exist under his name, should have been allowed in early
times to sink into almost entire oblivion.

<span id="v.i-p13"></span>We know with certainty regarding Athenagoras,
that he was an Athenian philosopher who had embraced Christianity, and
that his *Apology*, or, as he styles it, “Embassy” (<span
class="Greek"><span id="v.i-p13.1"></span>πρεσβεία</span>), was
presented to the Emperors Aurelius and Commodus about <span
class="sc"><span id="v.i-p13.2"></span>a.d.</span> 177. He is supposed
to have written a considerable number of works, but the only other
production of his extant is his treatise on the Resurrection. It is
probable that this work was composed somewhat later than the *Apology*
(see chap. xxxvi.), though its exact date cannot be determined. Philip
of Side also states that he preceded Pantænus as head of the
catechetical school at Alexandria; but this is probably incorrect, and
is contradicted by Eusebius. A more interesting and perhaps well-rounded
statement is made by the same writer respecting Athenagoras, to the
effect that he was won over to Christianity while reading the Scriptures
in order to controvert them. <span id="fr_696"></span>[697](#fn_696.md)
Both his *Apology* and his treatise on the Resurrection display a
practiced pen and a richly cultured mind. He is by far the most elegant,
and certainly at the same time one of the ablest, of the early Christian
Apologists.

depends on the support it finds in other Fathers, under the supremacy of
Scripture: hence the utility of Kaye’s collocations.

id="v.i-p13.3"></span>

<span id="v.i-p14"></span> \[Here a picture suggests itself. We go back
to the times of Hadrian. A persecution is raging against the
“Nazarenes.” A boyish, but well-cultured Athenian saunters into the
market-place to hear some new thing. They are talking of those enemies
of the human race, the Christians. Curiosity leads him to their
assemblies. He finds them keeping the feast of the resurrection.
Quadratus is preaching. He mocks, but is persuaded to open one of St.
Paul’s Epistles. “What will this babbler say?” He reads the fifteenth
chapter of First Corinthians, and resents it with all the objections
still preserved in his pages. One can see him inquiring more about this
Paul, and reading the seventeenth chapter of the Acts. What an animated
description of his own Athens, and in what a new light it reflects the
familiar scenes! He must refute this Paul. But, when he undertakes it,
he falls in love when the intrepid assailant of the gods of Greece.
Scales fall from his own eyes. How he sees it all at last, we find in
the two works here presented, corresponding as they do, first and last,
with the two parts of the apostle’s speech to the men of Athens.\]
