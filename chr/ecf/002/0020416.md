##### <span id="vi.iv.vii.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.—Prayers and Praise from a Pure Mind, Ceaselessly Offered, Far Better Than Sacrifices.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.vi-p1"></span>As, then, God is not circumscribed by
place, neither is ever represented by the form of a living creature; so
neither has He similar passions, nor has He wants like the creatures, so
as to desire sacrifice, from hunger, by way of food. Those creatures
which are affected by passion are all mortal. And it is useless to bring
food to one who is not nourished.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.vi-p2"></span>And that comic poet Pherecrates, in
*The Fugitives*, facetiously represents the gods themselves as finding
fault with men on the score of their sacred rites:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vii.vi-p2.1"></span> “When to the gods you
> sacrifice,  
> Selecting what our portion is,  
> ’Tis shame to tell, do ye not take,  
> And both the thighs, clean to the groins,  
> The loins quite bare, the backbone, too,  
> Clean scrape as with a file,  
> Them swallow, and the remnant give  
> To us as if to dogs? And then,  
> As if of one another ’shamed,  
> With heaps of salted barley hide.” <span
> id="fr_3548"></span>[3549](#fn_3548)  

<span id="vi.iv.vii.vi-p4"></span>And Eubulus, also a comic poet, thus
writes respecting sacrifices:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vii.vi-p4.1"></span> “But to the gods the tail alone  
> And thigh, as if to pæderasts you sacrifice.”  

<span id="vi.iv.vii.vi-p5"></span>And introducing Dionysus in Semele, he
represents him disputing:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vii.vi-p5.1"></span> “First if they offer aught to me,
> there are  
> Who offer blood, the bladder, not the heart  
> Or caul. For I no flesh do ever eat  
> That’s sweeter than the thigh.” <span
> id="fr_3549"></span>[3550](#fn_3549)  

<span id="vi.iv.vii.vi-p7"></span>And Menander writes:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vii.vi-p7.1"></span> “The end of the loin,  
> The bile, the bones uneatable, they set  
> Before the gods; the rest themselves consume.”  

<span id="vi.iv.vii.vi-p8"></span>For is not the savour of the
holocausts avoided by the beasts? And if in reality the savour is the
guerdon of the gods of the Greeks, should they not first deify the
cooks, who are dignified with equal happiness, and worship the chimney
itself, which is closer still to the much-prized savour?

<span id="vi.iv.vii.vi-p9"></span>And Hesiod says that Zeus, cheated in
a division of flesh by Prometheus, received the white bones of an ox,
concealed with cunning art, in shining fat:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vii.vi-p9.1"></span> “Whence to the immortal gods the
> tribes of men  
> The victim’s white bones on the altars burn.”  

<span id="vi.iv.vii.vi-p10"></span>But they will by no means say that
the Deity, enfeebled through the desire that springs from want, is
nourished. Accordingly, they will represent Him as nourished without
desire like a plant, and like beasts that burrow. They say that these
grow innoxiously, nourished either by the density in the air, or from
the exhalations proceeding from their own body. Though if the Deity,
though needing nothing, is according to them nourished, what necessity
has He for food, wanting nothing? But if, by nature needing nothing, He
delights to be honoured, it is not without reason that we honour God in
prayer; and thus the best and holiest sacrifice with righteousness we
bring, presenting it as an offering to the most righteous Word, by whom
we receive knowledge, giving glory by Him for what <span
id="fr_3550"></span>[3551](#fn_3550) we have learned.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.vi-p12"></span>The altar, then, that is with us
here, the terrestrial one, is the congregation of those who devote
themselves to prayers, having as it were one common voice and one mind.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.vi-p13"></span>Now, if nourishing substances taken
in by the nostrils are diviner than those taken in by the mouth, yet
they infer respiration. What, then, do they say of God? Whether does He
exhale like the tribe of oaks? <span
id="fr_3551"></span>[3552](#fn_3551) Or does He only inhale, like the
aquatic animals, by the dilatation of their gills? Or does He breathe
all round, like the insects, by the compression of the section by means
of their wings? But no one, if he is in his senses, will liken God to
any of these.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.vi-p15"></span>And the creatures that breathe by the
expansion of the lung towards the thorax draw in the air. Then if they
assign to God viscera, and arteries, and veins, and nerves, and parts,
they will make Him in nothing different from man.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.vi-p16"></span>Now breathing together (<span
class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.vii.vi-p16.1"></span>σύμπνοια</span>) <span
id="fr_3552"></span>[3553](#fn_3552) is properly said of the Church. For
the sacrifice of the Church is the word breathing as incense <span
id="fr_3553"></span>[3554](#fn_3553) from holy souls, the sacrifice and
the whole mind being at the same time unveiled to God. Now the very
ancient altar in Delos they celebrated as holy; which alone, being
undefiled by slaughter and death, they say Pythagoras approached. And
will they not believe us when we say that the righteous soul is the
truly sacred altar, and that incense arising from it is holy prayer? But
I believe sacrifices were invented by men to be a pretext for eating
flesh. <span id="fr_3554"></span>[3555](#fn_3554) But without such
idolatry he who wished might have partaken of flesh.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.vi-p20"></span>For the sacrifices of the Law express
figuratively <span id="page_532">p. 532</span> <span
id="vi.iv.vii.vi-Page_532"></span>the piety which we practice, as the
turtle-dove and the pigeon offered for sins point out that the cleansing
of the irrational part of the soul is acceptable to God. But if any one
of the righteous does not burden his soul by the eating of flesh, he has
the advantage of a rational reason, not as Pythagoras and his followers
dream of the transmigration of the soul.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.vi-p21"></span>Now Xenocrates, treating by himself
of “the food derived from animals,” and Polemon in his work *On Life
according to Nature*, seem clearly to say that animal food is
unwholesome, inasmuch as it has already been elaborated and assimilated
to the souls of the irrational creatures.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.vi-p22"></span>So also, in particular, the Jews
abstain from swine’s flesh on the ground of this animal being unclean;
since more than the other animals it roots up, and destroys the
productions of the ground. But if they say that the animals were
assigned to men—and we agree with them—yet it was not entirely for food.
Nor was it all animals, but such as do not work. Wherefore the comic
poet Plato says not badly in the drama of *The Feasts:* —

> <span id="vi.iv.vii.vi-p22.1"></span> “For of the quadrupeds we should
> not slay  
> In future aught but swine. For these have flesh  
> Most toothsome; and about the pig is nought  
> For us, excepting bristles, mud, and noise.”  

<span id="vi.iv.vii.vi-p23"></span>Whence Æsop said not badly, that
“swine squeaked out very loudly, because, when they were dragged, they
knew that they were good for nothing but for sacrifice.”

<span id="vi.iv.vii.vi-p24"></span>Wherefore also Cleanthes says, “that
they have soul <span id="fr_3555"></span>[3556](#fn_3555) instead of
salt,” that their flesh may not putrefy. Some, then, eat them as
useless, others as destructive of fruits. And others do not eat them,
because the animal has a strong sensual propensity.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.vi-p26"></span>So, then, the law sacrifices not the
goat, except in the sole case of the banishment of sins; <span
id="fr_3556"></span>[3557](#fn_3556) since pleasure is the metropolis of
vice. It is to the point also that it is said that the eating of goat’s
flesh contributes to epilepsy. And they say that the greatest increase
is produced by swine’s flesh. Wherefore it is beneficial to those who
exercise the body; but to those who devote themselves to the development
of the soul it is not so, on account of the hebetude that results from
the eating of flesh. Perchance also some Gnostic will abstain from the
eating of flesh for the sake of training, and in order that the flesh
may not grow wanton in amorousness. “For wine,” says Androcydes, “and
gluttonous feeds of flesh make the body strong, but the soul more
sluggish.” Accordingly such food, in order to clear understanding, is to
be rejected.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.vi-p28"></span>Wherefore also the Egyptians, in the
purifications practiced among them, do not allow the priests to feed on
flesh; but they use chickens, as lightest; and they do not touch fish,
on account of certain fables, but especially on account of such food
making the flesh flabby. But now terrestrial animals and birds breathe
the same air as our vital spirits, being possessed of a vital principle
cognate with the air. But it is said that fishes do not breathe this
air, but that which was mixed with the water at the instant of its first
creation, as well as with the rest of the elements, which is also a sign
of the permanence of matter. <span id="fr_3557"></span>[3558](#fn_3557)

<span id="vi.iv.vii.vi-p30"></span>Wherefore we ought to offer to God
sacrifices not costly, but such as He loves. And that compounded incense
which is mentioned in the Law, is that which consists of many tongues
and voices in prayer, <span id="fr_3558"></span>[3559](#fn_3558) or
rather of different nations and natures, prepared by the gift vouchsafed
in the dispensation for “the unity of the faith,” and brought together
in praises, with a pure mind, and just and right conduct, from holy
works and righteous prayer. For in the elegant language of poetry,—

> <span id="vi.iv.vii.vi-p31.1"></span> “Who is so great a fool, and
> among men  
> So very easy of belief, as thinks  
> The gods, with fraud of fleshless bones and bile  
> All burnt, not fit for hungry dogs to eat,  
> Delighted are, and take this as their prize,  
> And favour show to those who treat them thus,”  

<span id="vi.iv.vii.vi-p32"></span>though they happen to be tyrants and
robbers?

<span id="vi.iv.vii.vi-p33"></span>But we say that the fire
sanctifies <span id="fr_3559"></span>[3560](#fn_3559) not flesh, but
sinful souls; meaning not the all-devouring vulgar fire <span
id="fr_3560"></span>[3561](#fn_3560) but that of wisdom, which pervades
the soul passing through the fire.
