##### <span id="iv.ii.iii.xx-p0.1"></span>Chapter XX.—Antiquity of Moses.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.xx-p1"></span>And Moses, becoming the leader of the
Jews, as we have already stated, was expelled from the land of Egypt by
the king, Pharaoh, whose name was Amasis, and who, they say, reigned
after the expulsion of the people 25 years and 4 months, as Manetho
assumes. And after him \[reigned\] Chebron, 13 years. And after him
Amenophis, 20 years 7 months. And after him his sister Amessa, 21 years
1 month. And after her Mephres, 12 years 9 months. And after him
Methramuthosis, 20 years and 10 months. And after him Tythmoses, 9 years
8 months. And after him Damphenophis, 30 years 10 months. And after him
Orus, 35 years 5 months. And after him his daughter, 10 years 3 months.
After her Mercheres, 12 years 3 months. And after him his son Armais, 30
years 1 month. After him Messes, son of Miammus, 6 years, 2 months.
After him Rameses, 1 year 4 months. After him Amenophis, 19 years 6
months. After him his sons Thoessus and Rameses, 10 years, who, it is
said, had a large cavalry force and naval equipment. The Hebrews,
indeed, after their own separate history, having at that time migrated
into the land of Egypt, and been enslaved by the king Tethmosis, as
already said, built for him strong cities, Peitho, and Rameses, and On,
which is Heliopolis; so that the Hebrews, who also are our ancestors,
and from whom we have those sacred books which are older than all
authors, as already said, are proved to be more ancient than the cities
which were at that time renowned among the Egyptians. And the country
was called Egypt from the king Sethos. For the word Sethos, they say, is
pronounced “Egypt.” <span id="fr_678"></span>[679](#fn_678) And Sethos
had a brother, by name Armais. He is called Danaus, the same who passed
from Egypt to Argos, whom the other authors mention as being of very
ancient date.
