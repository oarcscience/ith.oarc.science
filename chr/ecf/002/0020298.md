##### <span id="vi.iv.i.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.—Philosophy the Handmaid of Theology.

<span id="vi.iv.i.v-p1"></span>Accordingly, before the advent of the
Lord, philosophy was necessary to the Greeks for righteousness. <span
id="fr_1850"></span>[1851](#fn_1850.md) And now it becomes conducive to
piety; being a kind of preparatory training to those who attain to faith
through demonstration. “For thy foot,” it is said, “will not stumble, if
thou refer what is good, whether belonging to the Greeks or to us, to
Providence.” <span id="fr_1851"></span>[1852](#fn_1851.md) For God is the
cause of all good things; but of some primarily, as of the Old and the
New Testament; and of others by consequence, as philosophy. Perchance,
too, philosophy was given to the Greeks directly and primarily, till the
Lord should call the Greeks. For this was a schoolmaster to bring “the
Hellenic mind,” as the law, the Hebrews, “to Christ.” <span
id="fr_1852"></span>[1853](#fn_1852.md) Philosophy, therefore, was a
preparation, paving the way for him who is perfected in Christ. <span
id="fr_1853"></span>[1854](#fn_1853.md)

<span id="vi.iv.i.v-p6"></span>“Now,” says Solomon, “defend wisdom, and
it will exalt thee, and it will shield thee with a crown of
pleasure.” <span id="fr_1854"></span>[1855](#fn_1854.md) For when thou hast
strengthened wisdom with a cope by philosophy, and with right
expenditure, thou wilt preserve it unassailable by sophists. The way of
truth is therefore one. But into it, as into a perennial river, streams
flow from all sides. It has been therefore said by inspiration: “Hear,
my son, and receive my words; that thine may be the many ways of life.
For I teach thee the ways of wisdom; that the fountains fail thee
not,” <span id="fr_1855"></span>[1856](#fn_1855.md) which gush forth from
the earth itself. Not only did He enumerate several ways of salvation
for any one righteous man, but He added many other ways of many
righteous, speaking thus: “The paths of the righteous shine like the
light.” <span id="fr_1856"></span>[1857](#fn_1856.md) The commandments and
the modes of preparatory training are to be regarded as the ways and
appliances of life.

<span id="vi.iv.i.v-p10"></span>“Jerusalem, Jerusalem, how often would I
have gathered thy children, as a hen her chickens!” <span
id="fr_1857"></span>[1858](#fn_1857.md) And Jerusalem is, when interpreted,
“a vision of peace.” He therefore shows prophetically, that those who
peacefully contemplate sacred things are in manifold ways trained to
their calling. What then? He “would,” and could not. How often, and
where? Twice; by <span id="page_306">p. 306</span> <span
id="vi.iv.i.v-Page_306"></span>the prophets, and by the advent. The
expression, then, “How often,” shows wisdom to be manifold; every mode
of quantity and quality, it by all means saves some, both in time and in
eternity. “For the Spirit of the Lord fills the earth.” <span
id="fr_1858"></span>[1859](#fn_1858.md) And if any should violently say
that the reference is to the Hellenic culture, when it is said, “Give
not heed to an evil woman; for honey drops from the lips of a harlot,”
let him hear what follows: “who lubricates thy throat for the time.” But
philosophy does not flatter. Who, then, does He allude to as having
committed fornication? He adds expressly, “For the feet of folly lead
those who use her, after death, to Hades. But her steps are not
supported.” Therefore remove thy way far from silly pleasure. “Stand not
at the doors of her house, that thou yield not thy life to others.” And
He testifies, “Then shall thou repent in old age, when the flesh of thy
body is consumed.” For this is the end of foolish pleasure. Such,
indeed, is the case. And when He says, “Be not much with a strange
woman,” <span id="fr_1859"></span>[1860](#fn_1859.md) He admonishes us to
use indeed, but not to linger and spend time with, secular culture. For
what was bestowed on each generation advantageously, and at seasonable
times, is a preliminary training for the word of the Lord. “For already
some men, ensnared by the charms of handmaidens, have despised their
consort philosophy, and have grown old, some of them in music, some in
geometry, others in grammar, the most in rhetoric.” <span
id="fr_1860"></span>[1861](#fn_1860.md) “But as the encyclical branches of
study contribute to philosophy, which is their mistress; so also
philosophy itself co-operates for the acquisition of wisdom. For
philosophy is the study of wisdom, and wisdom is the knowledge of things
divine and human; and their causes.” Wisdom is therefore queen of
philosophy, as philosophy is of preparatory culture. For if philosophy
“professes control of the tongue, and the belly, and the parts below the
belly, it is to be chosen on its own account. But it appears more worthy
of respect and pre-eminence, if cultivated for the honour and knowledge
of God.” <span id="fr_1861"></span>[1862](#fn_1861.md) And Scripture will
afford a testimony to what has been said in what follows. Sarah was at
one time barren, being Abraham’s wife. Sarah having no child, assigned
her maid, by name Hagar, the Egyptian, to Abraham, in order to get
children. Wisdom, therefore, who dwells with the man of faith (and
Abraham was reckoned faithful and righteous), was still barren and
without child in that generation, not having brought forth to Abraham
aught allied to virtue. And she, as was proper, thought that he, being
now in the time of progress, should have intercourse with secular
culture first (by Egyptian the world is designated figuratively); and
afterwards should approach to her according to divine providence, and
beget Isaac.” <span id="fr_1862"></span>[1863](#fn_1862.md)

<span id="vi.iv.i.v-p17"></span>And Philo interprets Hagar to mean
“sojourning.” <span id="fr_1863"></span>[1864](#fn_1863.md) For it is said
in connection with this, “Be not much with a strange woman.” <span
id="fr_1864"></span>[1865](#fn_1864.md) Sarah he interprets to mean “my
princedom.” He, then, who has received previous training is at liberty
to approach to wisdom, which is supreme, from which grows up the race of
Israel. These things show that that wisdom can be acquired through
instruction, to which Abraham attained, passing from the contemplation
of heavenly things to the faith and righteousness which are according to
God. And Isaac is shown to mean “self-taught;” wherefore also he is
discovered to be a type of Christ. He was the husband of one wife
Rebecca, which they translate “Patience.” And Jacob is said to have
consorted with several, his name being interpreted “Exerciser.” And
exercises are engaged in by means of many and various dogmas. Whence,
also, he who is really “endowed with the power of seeing” is called
Israel, <span id="fr_1865"></span>[1866](#fn_1865.md) having much
experience, and being fit for exercise.

<span id="vi.iv.i.v-p21"></span>Something else may also have been shown
by the three patriarchs, namely, that the sure seal of knowledge is
composed of nature, of education, and exercise.

<span id="vi.iv.i.v-p22"></span>You may have also another image of what
has been said, in Thamar sitting by the way, and presenting the
appearance of a harlot, on whom the studious Judas (whose name is
interpreted “powerful”), who left nothing unexamined and uninvestigated,
looked; and turned aside to her, preserving his profession towards God.
Wherefore also, when Sarah was jealous at Hagar being preferred to her,
Abraham, as choosing only what was profitable in secular philosophy,
said, “Behold, thy maid is in thine hands: deal with her as it pleases
thee;” <span id="fr_1866"></span>[1867](#fn_1866.md) manifestly meaning, “I
embrace secular culture as youthful, and a handmaid; but thy knowledge I
honour and reverence as true wife.” And Sarah afflicted her; which is
equivalent to corrected and admonished her. It has therefore been well
said, “My son, despise not thou the correction of God; nor faint when
thou art rebuked of Him. For whom the <span class="sc"><span
id="vi.iv.i.v-p23.2"></span>Lord</span> loveth He chasteneth, and <span
id="page_307">p. 307</span> <span
id="vi.iv.i.v-Page_307"></span>scourgeth every son whom He
receiveth.” <span id="fr_1867"></span>[1868](#fn_1867.md) And the foresaid
Scriptures, when examined in other places, will be seen to exhibit other
mysteries. We merely therefore assert here, that philosophy is
characterized by investigation into truth and the nature of things (this
is the truth of which the Lord Himself said, “I am the truth” <span
id="fr_1868"></span>[1869](#fn_1868) .md); and that, again, the preparatory
training for rest in Christ exercises the mind, rouses the intelligence,
and begets an inquiring shrewdness, by means of the true philosophy,
which the initiated possess, having found it, or rather received it,
from the truth itself.
