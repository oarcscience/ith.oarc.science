<span id="vi.iv.ii.v"></span>

##### <span id="vi.iv.ii.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.—He Proves by Several Examples that the Greeks Drew from the Sacred Writers.

<span id="vi.iv.ii.v-p1"></span>Accordingly all those above-mentioned
dogmas appear to have been transmitted from Moses the great to the
Greeks. That all things belong to the wise man, is taught in these
words: “And because God hath showed me mercy, I have all things.” <span
id="fr_2189"></span>[2190](#fn_2189) And that he is beloved of God, God
intimates when He says, “The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God
of Jacob.” <span id="fr_2190"></span>[2191](#fn_2190) For the first is
found to have been expressly called “friend;” <span
id="fr_2191"></span>[2192](#fn_2191) and the second is shown to have
received a new name, signifying “he that sees God;” <span
id="fr_2192"></span>[2193](#fn_2192) while Isaac, God in a figure
selected for Himself as a consecrated sacrifice, to be a type to us of
the economy of salvation.

<span id="vi.iv.ii.v-p6"></span>Now among the Greeks, Minos the king of
nine years’ reign, and familiar friend of Zeus, is celebrated in song;
they having heard how once God conversed with Moses, “as one speaking
with his friend.” <span id="fr_2193"></span>[2194](#fn_2193) Moses,
then, was a sage, king, legislator. But our Saviour surpasses all human
nature. <span id="fr_2194"></span>[2195](#fn_2194) He is so lovely, as
to be alone loved by us, whose hearts are set on the true beauty, for
“He was the true light.” <span id="fr_2195"></span>[2196](#fn_2195) He
is shown to be a King, as such hailed by unsophisticated children and by
the unbelieving and ignorant Jews, and heralded by the prophets. So rich
is He, that He despised the whole earth, and the gold above and beneath
it, with all glory, when given to Him by the adversary. What need is
there to say that He is the only High Priest, who alone possesses <span
id="page_352">p. 352</span> <span id="vi.iv.ii.v-Page_352"></span>the
knowledge of the worship of God? <span
id="fr_2196"></span>[2197](#fn_2196) He is Melchizedek, “King of
peace,” <span id="fr_2197"></span>[2198](#fn_2197) the most fit of all
to head the race of men. A legislator too, inasmuch as He gave the law
by the mouth of the prophets, enjoining and teaching most distinctly
what things are to be done, and what not. Who of nobler lineage than He
whose only Father is God? Come, then, let us produce Plato assenting to
those very dogmas. The wise man he calls rich in the *Phœdrus*, when he
says, “O dear Pan, and whatever other gods are here, grant me to become
fair within; and whatever external things I have, let them be agreeable
to what is within. I would reckon the wise man rich.” <span
id="fr_2198"></span>[2199](#fn_2198) And the Athenian stranger, <span
id="fr_2199"></span>[2200](#fn_2199) finding fault with those who think
that those who have many possessions are rich, speaks thus: “For the
very rich to be also good is impossible—those, I mean, whom the
multitude count rich. Those they call rich, who, among a few men, are
owners of the possessions worth most money; which any bad man may
possess.” “The whole world of wealth belongs to the believer,” <span
id="fr_2200"></span>[2201](#fn_2200) Solomon says, “but not a penny to
the unbeliever.” Much more, then, is the Scripture to be believed which
says, “It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than
for a rich man” <span id="fr_2201"></span>[2202](#fn_2201) to lead a
philosophic life. But, on the other hand, it blesses “the poor;” <span
id="fr_2202"></span>[2203](#fn_2202) as Plato understood when he said,
“It is not the diminishing of one’s resources, but the augmenting of
insatiableness, that is to be considered poverty; for it is not slender
means that ever constitutes poverty, but insatiableness, from which the
good man being free, will also be rich.” And in *Alcibiades* he calls
vice a servile thing, and virtue the attribute of freemen. “Take away
from you the heavy yoke, and take up the easy one,” <span
id="fr_2203"></span>[2204](#fn_2203) says the Scripture; as also the
poets call \[vice\] a slavish yoke. And the expression, “Ye have sold
yourselves to your sins,” agrees with what is said above: “Every one,
then, who committeth sin is a slave; and the slave abideth not in the
house for ever. But if the Son shall make you free, then shall ye be
free, and the truth shall make you free.” <span
id="fr_2204"></span>[2205](#fn_2204)

<span id="vi.iv.ii.v-p19"></span>And again, that the wise man is
beautiful, the Athenian stranger asserts, in the same way as if one were
to affirm that certain persons were just, even should they happen to be
ugly in their persons. And in speaking thus with respect to eminent
rectitude of character, no one who should assert them to be on this
account beautiful would be thought to speak extravagantly. And “His
appearance was inferior to all the Sons of men,” <span
id="fr_2205"></span>[2206](#fn_2205) prophecy predicted.

<span id="vi.iv.ii.v-p21"></span>Plato, moreover, has called the wise
man a king, in *The Statesman*. The remark is quoted above.

<span id="vi.iv.ii.v-p22"></span>These points being demonstrated, let us
recur again to our discourse on faith. Well, with the fullest
demonstration, Plato proves, that there is need of faith everywhere,
celebrating peace at the same time: “For no man will ever be trusty and
sound in seditions without entire virtue. There are numbers of
mercenaries full of fight, and willing to die in war; but, with a very
few exceptions, the most of them are desperadoes and villains, insolent
and senseless.” If these observations are right, “every legislator who
is even of slight use, will, in making his laws, have an eye to the
greatest virtue. Such is fidelity,” <span
id="fr_2206"></span>[2207](#fn_2206) which we need at all times, both in
peace and in war, and in all the rest of our life, for it appears to
embrace the other virtues. “But the best thing is neither war nor
sedition, for the necessity of these is to be deprecated. But peace with
one another and kindly feeling are what is best.” From these remarks the
greatest prayer evidently is to have peace, according to Plato. And
faith is the greatest mother of the virtues. Accordingly it is rightly
said in Solomon, “Wisdom is in the mouth of the faithful. <span
id="fr_2207"></span>[2208](#fn_2207) Since also Xenocrates, in his book
on “Intelligence,” says “that wisdom is the knowledge of first causes
and of intellectual essence.” He considers intelligence as twofold,
practical and theoretical, which latter is human wisdom. Consequently
wisdom is intelligence, but all intelligence is not wisdom. And it has
been shown, that the knowledge of the first cause of the universe is of
faith, but is not demonstration. For it were strange that the followers
of the Samian Pythagoras, rejecting demonstrations of subjects of
question, should regard the bare *ipse dixit* <span
id="fr_2208"></span>[2209](#fn_2208) as ground of belief; and that this
expression alone sufficed for the confirmation of what they heard, while
those devoted to the contemplation of the truth, presuming to disbelieve
the trustworthy Teacher, God the only Saviour, should demand of Him
tests of His utterances. But He says, “He that hath ears to hear, let
him hear.” And who is he? Let Epicharmus say:—

> <span id="vi.iv.ii.v-p25.2"></span> “Mind sees, mind hears; all
> besides is deaf and blind.” <span
> id="fr_2209"></span>[2210](#fn_2209)  

<span id="vi.iv.ii.v-p27"></span>Rating some as unbelievers, Heraclitus
says, <span id="page_353">p. 353</span> <span
id="vi.iv.ii.v-Page_353"></span>“Not knowing how to hear or to speak;”
aided doubtless by Solomon, who says, “If thou lovest to hear, thou
shalt comprehend; and if thou incline thine ear, thou shalt be
wise.” <span id="fr_2210"></span>[2211](#fn_2210)
