##### <span id="iv.ii.iii.xxix-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXIX.—Antiquity of Christianity.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.xxix-p1"></span>These periods, then, and all the
above-mentioned facts, being viewed collectively, one can see the
antiquity of the prophetical writings and the divinity of our doctrine,
that the doctrine is not recent, nor our tenets mythical and false, as
some think; but very ancient and true. For Thallus mentioned Belus, king
of the Assyrians, and Saturn, son of Titan, alleging that Belus with the
Titans made war against Jupiter and the so-called gods in his alliance;
and on this occasion he says that Gyges, being defeated, fled to
Tartessus. At that time Gyges ruled over that country, which then was
called Acte, but now is named Attica. And whence the other countries and
cities derived their names, we think it unnecessary to recount,
especially to you who are acquainted with history. That Moses, and not
he only, but also most of the prophets who followed him, is proved to be
older than all writers, and than Saturn and Belus and the Trojan war, is
manifest. For according to the history of Thallus, Belus is found to be
322 years prior to the Trojan war. But we have shown above that Moses
lived somewhere about 900 or 1000 years before the sack of Troy. And as
Saturn and Belus flourished at the same time, most people do not know
which is Saturn and which is Belus. Some worship Saturn, and call him
Bel or Bal, especially the inhabitants of the eastern countries, for
they do not know who either Saturn or Belus is. And among the Romans he
is called Saturn, for neither do they know which of the two is more
ancient—Saturn or Bel. So far as regards the commencement of the
Olympiads, they say that the observance dates from Iphitus, but
according to others from Linus, who is also called Ilius. The order
which the whole number of years and Olympiads holds, we have shown
above. I think I have now, according to my ability, accurately
discoursed both of the godlessness of your practices, <span
id="fr_689"></span>[690](#fn_689.md) and of the whole number of the epochs
of history. For if even a chronological error has been committed by us,
of, e.g., 50 or 100, or even 200 years, yet <span id="page_121">p.
121</span> <span id="iv.ii.iii.xxix-Page_121"></span>not of thousands
and tens of thousands, as Plato and Apollonius and other mendacious
authors have hitherto written. And perhaps our knowledge of the whole
number of the years is not quite accurate, because the odd months and
days are not set down in the sacred books. <span
id="fr_690"></span>[691](#fn_690.md) But so far as regards the periods we
speak of, we are corroborated by Berosus, <span
id="fr_691"></span>[692](#fn_691.md) the Chaldæan philosopher, who made the
Greeks acquainted with the Chaldæan literature, and uttered some things
concerning the deluge, and many other points of history, in agreement
with Moses; and with the prophets Jeremiah and Daniel also, he spoke in
a measure of agreement. For he mentioned what happened to the Jews under
the king of the Babylonians, whom he calls Abobassor, and who is called
by the Hebrews Nebuchadnezzar. And he also spoke of the temple of
Jerusalem; how it was desolated by the king of the Chaldæans, and that
the foundations of the temple having been laid the second year of the
reign of Cyrus, the temple was completed in the second year of the reign
of Darius.
