##### <span id="iv.ii.i.xi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XI.—The King to Be Honoured, God to Be Worshipped.

<span id="iv.ii.i.xi-p1"></span>Wherefore I will rather honour the king
\[than your gods\], not, indeed, worshipping him, but praying for him.
But God, the living and true God, I worship, knowing that the king is
made by Him. You will say, then, to me, “Why do you not worship the
king?” Because he is not made to be worshipped, but to be reverenced
with lawful honour, for he is not a god, but a man appointed by God, not
to be worshipped, but to judge justly. For in a kind of way his
government is committed to him by God: as He will not have those called
kings whom He has appointed under Himself; for “king” is his title, and
it is not lawful for another to use it; so neither is it lawful for any
to be worshipped but God only. Wherefore, O man, you are wholly in
error. Accordingly, honour the king, be subject to him, and pray for him
with loyal mind; for if you do this, you do the will of God. For the law
that is of God, says, “My son, fear thou the Lord and the king, and be
not disobedient to them; for suddenly they shall take vengeance on their
enemies.” <span id="fr_539"></span>[540](#fn_539.md)

The Greek of Theophilus has “honour” instead of “fear.”
