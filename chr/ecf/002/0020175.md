##### <span id="v.ii.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.—Testimony of the Poets to the Unity of God. <span id="fr_708"></span>[709](#fn_708)

<span id="v.ii.v-p2"></span>Poets and philosophers have not been voted
atheists for inquiring concerning God. Euripides, speaking of those who,
according to popular preconception, are ignorantly called gods, says
doubtingly:—

> <span id="v.ii.v-p2.1"></span> “If Zeus indeed does reign in heaven
> above,  
> He ought not on the righteous ills to send.” <span
> id="fr_709"></span>[710](#fn_709)  

<span id="v.ii.v-p4"></span>But speaking of Him who is apprehended by
the understanding as matter of certain knowledge, he gives his opinion
decidedly, and with intelligence, thus:—

> <span id="v.ii.v-p4.1"></span> “Seest thou on high him who, with humid
> arms,  
> Clasps both the boundless ether and the earth?  
> Him reckon Zeus, and him regard as God.” <span
> id="fr_710"></span>[711](#fn_710)  

<span id="v.ii.v-p6"></span>For, as to these so-called gods, he neither
saw any real existences, to which a name is usually assigned, underlying
them (“Zeus,” for instance: “who Zeus is I know not, but by report”),
nor that any names were given to realities which actually do exist (for
of what use are names to those who have no real existences underlying
them?); but Him he did see by means of His works, considering with an
eye to things unseen the things which are manifest in air, in ether, on
earth. Him therefore, from whom proceed all created things, and by whose
Spirit they are governed, he concluded to be God; and Sophocles agrees
with him, when he says:—

> <span id="v.ii.v-p6.1"></span> “There is one God, in truth there is
> but one,  
> Who made the heavens, and the broad earth beneath.” <span
> id="fr_711"></span>[712](#fn_711)  

<span id="v.ii.v-p8"></span>\[Euripides is speaking\] of the nature of
God, which fills His works with beauty, and teaching both where God must
be, and that He must be One.

<span id="v.ii.v-p1"></span> \[De Maistre, who talks nothing but
sophistry when he rides his hobby, and who shocked the pope himself by
his fanatical effort to demonstrate the papal system, is, nevertheless,
very suggestive and interesting when he condescends to talk simply as a
Christian. See his citations showing the heathen consciousness of one
Supreme Being. *Soirées de St. Pétersbourg*, vol. i. pp. 225, 280; vol.
ii. pp. 379, 380.\]

<span id="v.ii.v-p5"></span> From an unknown play; the original is
ambiguous; comp. Cic. *De Nat Deorum*, ii. c. 25, where the words are
translated—“Seest thou this boundless ether on high which embraces the
earth in its moist arms? Reckon this Zeus.” Athenagoras cannot so have
understood Euripides.
