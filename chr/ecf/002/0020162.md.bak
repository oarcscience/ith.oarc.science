##### <span id="iv.ii.iii.xxv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXV.—From Saul to the Captivity.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.xxv-p1"></span>And after the judges they had kings,
the first named Saul, who reigned 20 years; then David, our forefather,
who reigned 40 years. Accordingly, there are to the reign of David
\[from Isaac\] 496 years. And after these kings Solomon reigned, who
also, by the will of God, was the first to build the temple in
Jerusalem; he reigned 40 years. And after him Rehoboam, 17 years; and
after him Abias, 7 years; and after him Asa, 41 years; and after him
Jehoshaphat, 25 years; and after him Joram, 8 years; and after him
Ahaziah, 1 year; and after him Athaliah, 6 years; and after her Josiah,
40 years; and after him Amaziah, 39 years; and after him Uzziah, 52
years; and after him Jotham, 16 years; and after him Ahaz, 17 years; and
after him Hezekiah, 29 years; and after him Manasseh, 55 years; and
after him Amon, 2 years; and after him Josiah, 31 years; and after him
Jehoahaz, 3 months; and after him Jehoiakim, 11 years. Then another
Jehoiakim, 3 months 10 days; and after him Zedekiah, 11 years. And after
these kings, the people, continuing in their sins, and not repenting,
the king of Babylon, named Nebuchadnezzar, came up into Judæa, according
to the prophecy of Jeremiah. He transferred the people of the Jews to
Babylon, and destroyed the temple which Solomon had built. And in the
Babylonian banishment the people passed 70 years. Until the sojourning
in the land of Babylon, there are therefore, in all, 4954 years 6 months
and 10 days. And according as God had, by the prophet Jeremiah, foretold
that the people should be led captive to Babylon, in like manner He
signified beforehand that they should also return into their own land
after 70 years. These 70 years then being accomplished, Cyrus becomes
king of the Persians, who, according to the prophecy of Jeremiah, issued
a decree in the second year of his reign, enjoining by his edict that
all Jews who were in his kingdom should return to their own country, and
rebuild their temple to God, which the fore-mentioned king of Babylon
had demolished. Moreover, Cyrus, in compliance with the instructions of
God, gave orders to his own bodyguards, Sabessar and Mithridates, that
the vessels which had been taken out of the temple of Judæa by
Nebuchadnezzar should be restored, and placed again in the temple. In
the second year, therefore, of Darius are fulfilled the 70 years which
were foretold by Jeremiah.
