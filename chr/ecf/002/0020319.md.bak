##### <span id="vi.iv.i.xxvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXVI.—Moses Rightly Called a Divine Legislator, And, Though Inferior to Christ, Far Superior to the Great Legislators of the Greeks, Minos and Lycurgus.

<span id="vi.iv.i.xxvi-p1"></span>Whence the law was rightly said to
have been given by Moses, being a rule of right and wrong; and we may
call it with accuracy the divine ordinance (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.i.xxvi-p1.1"></span>θεσμός</span> <span
id="fr_2109"></span>[2110](#fn_2109) .md), inasmuch as it was given by God
through Moses. It accordingly conducts to the divine. Paul says: “The
law was instituted because of transgressions, till the seed should come,
to whom the promise was made.” Then, as if in explanation of his
meaning, he adds: “But before faith came, we were kept under the law,
shut up,” manifestly through fear, in consequence of sins, “unto the
faith which should afterwards be revealed; so that the law was a
schoolmaster to bring us to Christ, that we should be justified by
faith.” <span id="fr_2110"></span>[2111](#fn_2110.md) The true legislator
is he who assigns to each department of the soul what is suitable to it
and to its operations. Now Moses, to speak comprehensively, was a living
law, governed by the benign Word. Accordingly, he furnished a good
polity, which is the right discipline of men in social life. He also
handled the administration of justice, which is that branch of knowledge
which deals with the correction of transgressors in the interests of
justice. Co-ordinate with it is the faculty of dealing with punishments,
which is a knowledge of the due measure to be observed in punishments.
And punishment, in virtue of its being so, is the correction of the
soul. In a word, the whole system of Moses is suited for the training of
such as are capable of becoming good and noble men, and for hunting out
men like them; and this is the art of command. And that wisdom, which is
capable of treating rightly those who have been caught by the Word, is
legislative wisdom. For it is the property of this wisdom, being most
kingly, to possess and use,

<span id="vi.iv.i.xxvi-p4"></span>It is the wise man, therefore, alone
whom the philosophers proclaim king, legislator, general, just, holy,
God-beloved. And if we discover these qualities in Moses, as shown from
the Scriptures themselves, we may, with the most assured persuasion,
pronounce Moses to be truly wise. As then we say that it belongs to the
<span id="page_339">p. 339</span> <span
id="vi.iv.i.xxvi-Page_339"></span>shepherd’s art to care for the sheep;
for so “the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep;” <span
id="fr_2111"></span>[2112](#fn_2111.md) so also we shall say that
legislation,inasmuch as it presides over and cares for the flock of men,
establishes the virtue of men, by fanning into flame, as far as it can,
what good there is in humanity.

<span id="vi.iv.i.xxvi-p6"></span>And if the flock figuratively spoken
of as belonging to the Lord is nothing but a flock of men, then He
Himself is the good Shepherd and Lawgiver of the one flock, “of the
sheep who hear Him,” the one who cares for them, “seeking,” and finding
by the law and the word, “that which was lost;” since, in truth, the law
is spiritual and leads to felicity. For that which has arisen through
the Holy Spirit is spiritual. And he is truly a legislator, who not only
announces what is good and noble, but understands it. The law of this
man who possesses knowledge is the saving precept; or rather, the law is
the precept of knowledge. For the Word is “the power and the wisdom of
God.” <span id="fr_2112"></span>[2113](#fn_2112.md) Again, the expounder of
the laws is the same one by whom the law was given; the first expounder
of the divine commands, who unveiled the bosom of the Father, the
only-begotten Son.

<span id="vi.iv.i.xxvi-p8"></span>Then those who obey the law, since
they have some knowledge of Him, cannot disbelieve or be ignorant of the
truth. But those who disbelieve, and have shown a repugnance to engage
in the works of the law, whoever else may, certainly confess their
ignorance of the truth.

<span id="vi.iv.i.xxvi-p9"></span>What, then, is the unbelief of the
Greeks? Is it not their unwillingness to believe the truth which
declares that the law was divinely given by Moses, whilst they honour
Moses in their own writers? They relate that Minos received the laws
from Zeus in nine years, by frequenting the cave of Zeus; and Plato, and
Aristotle, and Ephorus write that Lycurgus was trained in legislation by
going constantly to Apollo at Delphi. Chamæleo of Heraclea, in his book
*On Drunkenness*, and Aristotle in *The Polity of Locrians*, mention
that Zaleucus the Locrian received the laws from Athene.

<span id="vi.iv.i.xxvi-p10"></span>But those who exalt the credit of
Greek legislation as far as in them lies, by referring it to a divine
source, after the model of Mosaic prophecy, are senseless in not owning
the truth, and the archetype of what is related among them.
