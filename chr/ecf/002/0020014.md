#### <span id="ii.iii.v-p0.1"></span>Commandment Fifth.

##### <span id="ii.iii.v-p0.2"></span>Of Sadness of Heart, and of Patience.

##### <span id="ii.iii.v-p0.3"></span>Chap. I.

<span id="ii.iii.v-p1"></span>“Be patient,” said he, “and of good
understanding, and you will rule over every wicked work, and you will
work all righteousness. For if you be patient, the Holy Spirit that
dwells in you will be pure. He will not be darkened by any evil spirit,
but, dwelling in a broad region, <span id="fr_179"></span>[180](#fn_179)
he will rejoice and be glad; and with the vessel in which he dwells he
will serve God in gladness, having great peace within himself. <span
id="fr_180"></span>[181](#fn_180) But if any outburst of anger take
place, forthwith the Holy Spirit, who is tender, is straitened, not
having a pure place, and He seeks to depart. For he is choked by the
vile spirit, and cannot attend on the Lord as he wishes, for anger
pollutes him. For the Lord dwells in long-suffering, but the devil in
anger. <span id="fr_181"></span>[182](#fn_181) The two spirits, then,
when dwelling in the same habitation, are at discord with each other,
and are troublesome to that man in whom they dwell. <span
id="fr_182"></span>[183](#fn_182) For if an exceedingly small piece of
wormwood be taken and put into a jar of honey, is not the honey entirely
destroyed, and does not the exceedingly small piece of wormwood entirely
take away the sweetness of the honey, so that it no longer affords any
gratification to its owner, but has become bitter, and lost its use? But
if the wormwood be not put into the honey, then the honey remains sweet,
and is of use to its owner. You see, then, that patience is sweeter than
honey, and useful to God, and the Lord dwells in it. But anger is bitter
and useless. Now, if anger be mingled with patience, the patience is
polluted, <span id="fr_183"></span>[184](#fn_183) and its prayer is not
then useful to God.” “I should like, sir,” said I, “to know the power of
anger, that I may guard myself against it.” And he said, “If you do not
guard yourself against it, you and your house lose all hope of
salvation. Guard yourself, therefore, against it. For I am with you, and
all will depart from it who repent with their whole heart. <span
id="fr_184"></span>[185](#fn_184) For I will be with them, and I will
save them all. For all are justified by the most holy angel.” <span
id="fr_185"></span>[186](#fn_185)

##### <span id="ii.iii.v-p8.2"></span>Chap. II.

<span id="ii.iii.v-p9"></span>“Hear now,” said he, “how wicked is the
action of anger, and in what way it overthrows the servants of God by
its action, and turns them from righteousness. But it does not turn away
those who are full of faith, nor does it act on them, for the power of
the Lord is with them. It is the thoughtless and doubting that it turns
away. <span id="fr_186"></span>[187](#fn_186) For as soon as it sees
such men standing stedfast, it throws itself into their hearts, and for
nothing at all the man or woman becomes embittered on account of
occurrences in their daily life, as for instance on account of their
food, or some superfluous word that has been uttered, or on account of
some friend, or some gift or debt, or some such senseless affair. For
all these things are foolish and empty and unprofitable to the servants
of God. But patience is great, and mighty, and strong, and calm in the
midst of great enlargement, joyful, rejoicing, free from care,
glorifying God at all times, having no bitterness in her, and abiding
continually meek and quiet. Now this patience dwells with those who have
complete faith. But anger is foolish, and fickle, and senseless. Now, of
folly is begotten bitterness, and of bitterness anger, and of anger
frenzy. This frenzy, the product of so many evils, ends in great and
incurable sin. For when all these spirits dwell in one vessel in which
the Holy Spirit also dwells, the vessel cannot contain them, but
overflows. The tender Spirit, then, not being accustomed to dwell with
the wicked spirit, nor with hardness, withdraws from such a man, and
seeks to dwell with meekness and peacefulness. Then, when he withdraws
from the man in whom he dwelt, the man is emptied of the righteous
Spirit; and being henceforward filled with evil spirits, <span
id="fr_187"></span>[188](#fn_187) he is in a state of anarchy in every
action, being dragged hither and thither by the evil spirits, and there
is a complete darkness in his mind as to everything good. This, then, is
what happens to all the angry. Wherefore do you depart from that most
wicked spirit anger, and put on patience, and resist anger and
bitterness, and you will be found in company with the purity which is
loved by the Lord. <span id="fr_188"></span>[189](#fn_188) Take care,
then, that you neglect not by any chance this commandment: for if you
obey this commandment, you will be able to keep all the other
commandments which I am to give you. Be strong, then, in these
commandments, and put on power, and <span id="page_24">p. 24</span>
<span id="ii.iii.v-Page_24"></span>let all put on power, as many as wish
to walk in them.” <span id="fr_189"></span>[190](#fn_189)

<span id="ii.iii.v-p2"></span> It will be noticed that space is
attributed to the heart or soul, and that joy and goodness expand the
heart, and produce width, while sadness and wickedness contract and
straiten.

<span id="ii.iii.v-p3"></span> *But … himself.* But rejoicing he will be
expanded, and he will feast in the vessel in which he dwells, and he
will serve the Lord joyfully in the midst of great peace.—*Vat.* He will
serve the Lord in great gladness, having abundance of all things within
himself.—*Pal*.

number of the just by the most holy angel (or messenger).—*Pal*. \[i.e.,
As the *instrument* of justification; but the superlative here used
seems to indentify this angel with that of the covenant ([Mal. iii.

i.e., the meritorious cause, “the Lord.”\]

<span id="ii.iii.v-p10"></span> *Hear … away.* “Hear now,” said he, “how
great is the wickedness of anger, and how injurious, and in what way it
overthrows the servants of God. For they who are full of faith receive
no harm from it, for the power of God is with them; for it is the
doubters and those destitute \[of faith\] that it overturns.”—*Vat.*
\[The philosophic difference between anger and indignation is here in
view.\]

<span id="ii.iii.v-p13"></span> *And put … them.* That you may live to
God, and they who keep these commandments will live to God.—*Vat*. \[The
beauty of this chapter must be felt by all, especially in the eulogy on
*patience*. A pious and learned critic remarks on the emphasis and
frequent recurrence of scriptural exhortations to *patience*, which he
thinks have been to little enlarged upon in Christian literature.\]
