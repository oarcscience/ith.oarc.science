##### <span id="iv.ii.iii.xii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XII.—Of Righteousness.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.xii-p1"></span>Moreover, concerning the
righteousness which the law enjoined, confirmatory utterances are found
both with the prophets and in the Gospels, because they all spoke
inspired by one Spirit of God. Isaiah accordingly spoke thus: “Put away
the evil of your doings from your souls; learn to do well, seek
judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the
widow.” <span id="fr_654"></span>[655](#fn_654.md) And again the same
prophet said: “Loose every band of wickedness, dissolve every oppressive
contract, let the oppressed go free, and tear up every unrighteous bond.
Deal out thy bread to the hungry, and bring the houseless poor to thy
home. When thou seest the naked, cover him, and hide not thyself from
thine own flesh. Then shall thy light <span id="page_115">p. 115</span>
<span id="iv.ii.iii.xii-Page_115"></span>break forth as the morning, and
thine health shall spring forth speedily, and thy righteousness shall go
before thee.” <span id="fr_655"></span>[656](#fn_655.md) In like manner
also Jeremiah says: “Stand in the ways, and see, and ask which is the
good way of the <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.ii.iii.xii-p3.2"></span>Lord</span> your God, and walk in it and
ye shall find rest for your souls. Judge just judgment, for in this is
the will of the <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.ii.iii.xii-p3.3"></span>Lord</span> your God.” <span
id="fr_656"></span>[657](#fn_656.md) So also says Hosea: “Keep judgment,
and draw near to your God, who established the heavens and created the
earth.” <span id="fr_657"></span>[658](#fn_657.md) And another, Joel, spoke
in agreement with these: “Gather the people, sanctify the congregation,
assemble the elders, gather the children that are in arms; let the
bridegroom go forth of his chamber, and the bride out of her closet, and
pray to the <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.ii.iii.xii-p5.2"></span>Lord</span> thy God urgently that he may
have mercy upon you, and blot out your sins.” <span
id="fr_658"></span>[659](#fn_658.md) In like manner also another,
Zachariah: “Thus saith the <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.ii.iii.xii-p6.2"></span>Lord</span> Almighty, Execute true
judgment, and show mercy and compassion every man to his brother; and
oppress not the widow, nor the fatherless, nor the stranger; and let
none of you imagine evil against his brother in your heart, saith the
<span class="sc"><span id="iv.ii.iii.xii-p6.3"></span>Lord</span>
Almighty.” <span id="fr_659"></span>[660](#fn_659.md)
