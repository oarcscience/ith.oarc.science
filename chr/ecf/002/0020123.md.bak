##### <span id="iv.ii.ii.xxv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXV.—God Was Justified in Forbidding Man to Eat of the Tree of Knowledge.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xxv-p1"></span>The tree of knowledge itself was good,
and its fruit was good. For it was not the tree, as some think, but the
disobedience, which had death in it. For there was nothing else in the
fruit than only knowledge; but knowledge is good when one uses it
discreetly. <span id="fr_600"></span>[601](#fn_600.md) But Adam, being yet
an infant in age, was on this account as yet unable to receive knowledge
worthily. For now, also, when a child is born it is not at once able to
eat bread, but is nourished first with milk, and then, with the
increment of years, it advances to solid food. Thus, too, would it have
been with Adam; for not as one who grudged him, as some suppose, did God
command him not to eat of knowledge. But He wished also to make proof of
him, whether he was submissive to His commandment. And at the same time
He wished man, infant as he was, <span id="fr_601"></span>[602](#fn_601.md)
to remain for some time longer simple and sincere. For this is holy, not
only with God, but also with men, that in simplicity and guilelessness
subjection be yielded to parents. But if it is right that children be
subject to parents, how much more to the God and Father of all things?
Besides, it is unseemly that children in infancy be wise beyond their
years; for as in stature one increases in an orderly progress, so also
in wisdom. But as when a law has commanded abstinence from anything, and
some one has not obeyed, it is obviously not the law which causes
punishment, but the disobedience and transgression;—for a father
sometimes enjoins on his own child abstinence from certain things, and
when he does not obey the paternal order, he is flogged and punished on
account of the disobedience; and in this case the actions themselves are
not the \[cause of\] stripes, but the disobedience procures punishment
for him who disobeys;—so also for the first man, disobedience procured
his expulsion from Paradise. Not, therefore, as if there were any evil
in the tree of knowledge; but from his disobedience did man draw, as
from a fountain, labour, pain, grief, and at last fall a prey to death.

show, as some editors have done, that our author calls Adam an *infant*,
only with reference to time, not physical development. He was but a few
days old.\]
