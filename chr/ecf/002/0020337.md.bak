<span id="vi.iv.ii.xiii"></span>

##### <span id="vi.iv.ii.xiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIII.—On First and Second Repentance.

<span id="vi.iv.ii.xiii-p1"></span>He, then, who has received the
forgiveness of sins ought to sin no more. For, in addition to the first
and only repentance from sins (this is from the previous sins in the
first and heathen life—I mean that in ignorance), there is forthwith
proposed to those who have been called, the repentance which cleanses
the seat of the soul from transgressions, that faith may be established.
And the Lord, knowing the heart, and foreknowing the future, foresaw
both the fickleness of man and the craft and subtlety of the devil from
the first, from the beginning; how that, envying man for the forgiveness
of sins, he would present to the servants of God certain causes of sins;
skilfully working mischief, that they might fall together with himself.
Accordingly, being very merciful, He has vouch-safed, in the case of
those who, though in faith, fall into any transgression, a second
repentance; so that should any one be tempted after his calling,
overcome by force and fraud, he may receive still a repentance not to be
repented of. “For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the
knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins, but
a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which
shall devour the adversaries.” <span
id="fr_2277"></span>[2278](#fn_2277.md) But continual and successive
repentings for sins differ nothing from the case of those who have not
believed at all, except only in their consciousness that they do sin.
And I know not which of the two is worst, whether the case of a man who
sins knowingly, or of one who, after having repented of his sins,
transgresses again. For in the process of proof sin appears on each
side,—the sin which in its commission is condemned by the worker of the
iniquity, and that of the man who, foreseeing what is about to be done,
yet puts his hand to it as a wickedness. And he who perchance gratifies
himself in anger and pleasure, gratifies himself in he knows what; and
he who, repenting of that in which he gratified himself, by rushing
again into pleasure, is near neighbour to him who has sinned wilfully at
first. For one, who does again that of which he has repented, <span
id="page_361">p. 361</span> <span id="vi.iv.ii.xiii-Page_361"></span>and
condemning what he does, performs it willingly.

<span id="vi.iv.ii.xiii-p3"></span>He, then, who from among the Gentiles
and from that old life has betaken himself to faith, has obtained
forgiveness of sins once. But he who has sinned after this, on his
repentance, though he obtain pardon, ought to fear, as one no longer
washed to the forgiveness of sins. For not only must the idols which he
formerly held as gods, but the works also of his former life, be
abandoned by him who has been “born again, not of blood, nor of the will
of the flesh,” <span id="fr_2278"></span>[2279](#fn_2278.md) but in the
Spirit; which consists in repenting by not giving way to the same fault.
For frequent repentance and readiness to change easily from want of
training, is the practice of sin again. <span
id="fr_2279"></span>[2280](#fn_2279.md) The frequent asking of forgiveness,
then, for those things in which we often transgress, is the semblance of
repentance, not repentance itself. “But the righteousness of the
blameless cuts straight paths,” <span
id="fr_2280"></span>[2281](#fn_2280.md) says the Scripture. And again, “The
righteousness of the innocent will make his way right.” <span
id="fr_2281"></span>[2282](#fn_2281.md) Nay, “as a father pitieth his
children, so the <span class="sc"><span
id="vi.iv.ii.xiii-p7.2"></span>Lord</span> pitieth them that fear
Him.” <span id="fr_2282"></span>[2283](#fn_2282.md) David writes, “They who
sow,” then, “in tears, shall reap in joy;” <span
id="fr_2283"></span>[2284](#fn_2283.md) those, namely, who confess in
penitence. “For blessed are all those that fear the <span
class="sc"><span id="vi.iv.ii.xiii-p9.2"></span>Lord</span>.” <span
id="fr_2284"></span>[2285](#fn_2284.md) You see the corresponding blessing
in the Gospel. “Fear not,” it is said, “when a man is enriched, and when
the glory of his house is increased: because when he dieth he shall
leave all, and his glory shall not descend after him.” <span
id="fr_2285"></span>[2286](#fn_2285.md) “But I in Thy I mercy will enter
into Thy house. I will worship toward Thy holy temple, in Thy fear:
<span class="sc"><span id="vi.iv.ii.xiii-p11.2"></span>Lord</span>, lead
me in Thy righteousness.” <span id="fr_2286"></span>[2287](#fn_2286.md)
Appetite is then the movement of the mind to or from something. <span
id="fr_2287"></span>[2288](#fn_2287.md) Passion is an excessive appetite
exceeding the measures of reason, or appetite unbridled and disobedient
to the word. Passions, then, are a perturbation of the soul contrary to
nature, in disobedience to reason. But revolt and distraction and
disobedience are in our own power, as obedience is in our power.
Wherefore voluntary actions are judged. But should one examine each one
of the passions, he will find them irrational impulses.
