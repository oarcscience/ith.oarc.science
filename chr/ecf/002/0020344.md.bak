##### <span id="vi.iv.ii.xx-p0.1"></span>Chapter XX.—The True Gnostic Exercises Patience and Self-Restraint.

<span id="vi.iv.ii.xx-p1"></span>Endurance also itself forces its way to
the divine likeness, reaping as its fruit impassibility through
patience, if what is related of Ananias be kept in mind; who belonged to
a number, of whom Daniel the prophet, filled with divine faith, was one.
Daniel dwelt at Babylon, as Lot at Sodom, and Abraham, who a little
after became the friend of God, in the land of Chaldea. The king of the
Babylonians let Daniel down into a pit full of wild beasts; the King of
all, the faithful Lord, took him up unharmed. Such patience will the
Gnostic, as a Gnostic, possess. He will bless when under trial, like the
noble Job; like Jonas, when swallowed up by the whale, he will pray, and
faith will restore him to prophesy to the Ninevites; and though shut up
with lions, he will tame the wild beasts; though cast into the fire, he
will be besprinkled with dew, but not consumed. He will give his
testimony by night; he will testify by day; by word, by life, by
conduct, he will testify. Dwelling with the Lord <span
id="fr_2384"></span>[2385](#fn_2384.md) he will continue his familiar
friend, sharing the same hearth according to the Spirit; pure in the
flesh, pure in heart, sanctified in word. “The world,” it is said, “is
crucified to him, and he to the world.” <span
id="fr_2385"></span>[2386](#fn_2385.md) He, bearing about the cross of the
Saviour, will follow the Lord’s footsteps, as God, having become holy of
holies.

<span id="vi.iv.ii.xx-p4"></span>The divine law, then, while keeping in
mind all virtue, trains man especially to self-restraint, laying this as
the foundation of the virtues; and disciplines us beforehand to the
attainment of self-restraint by forbidding us to partake of such things
as are by nature fat, as the breed of swine, which is full-fleshed. For
such a use is assigned to epicures. It is accordingly said that one of
the philosophers, giving the etymology of <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.ii.xx-p4.1"></span>ὗς</span> (sow), said that it was <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.iv.ii.xx-p4.2"></span>θύς</span>, as being
fit only for slaughter (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.ii.xx-p4.3"></span>θύσιν</span>) and killing; for life was
given to this animal for no other purpose than that it might swell in
flesh. Similarly, repressing our desires, it forbade partaking of fishes
which have neither fins nor scales; for these surpass other fishes in
fleshiness and fatness. From this it was, in my opinion, that the
mysteries not only prohibited touching certain animals, but also
withdrew certain parts of those slain in sacrifice, for reasons which
are known to the initiated. If, then, we are to exercise control over
the belly, and what is below the belly, it is clear that we have of old
heard from the Lord that we are to check lust by the law.

<span id="vi.iv.ii.xx-p5"></span>And this will be completely effected,
if we unfeignedly condemn what is the fuel of lust: I mean pleasure. Now
they say that the idea of it is a gentle and bland excitement,
accompanied with some sensation. Enthralled by this, Menelaus, they say,
after the capture of Troy, having rushed to put Helen to death, as
having been the cause of such calamities, was nevertheless not able to
effect it, being subdued by her beauty, which made him think of
pleasure. Whence the tragedians, jeering, exclaimed insultingly against
him:—

> <span id="vi.iv.ii.xx-p5.1"></span> “But thou, when on her breast thou
> lookedst, thy sword  
> Didst cast away, and with a kiss the traitress,  
> Ever-beauteous wretch, <span id="fr_2386"></span>[2387](#fn_2386.md) thou
> didst embrace.”  

<span id="page_371">p. 371</span> <span
id="vi.iv.ii.xx-Page_371"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.ii.xx-p7"></span>And again:—

> <span id="vi.iv.ii.xx-p7.1"></span> “Was the sword then by beauty
> blunted?”  

<span id="vi.iv.ii.xx-p8"></span>And I agree with Antisthenes when he
says, “Could I catch Aphrodite, I would shoot her; for she has destroyed
many of our beautiful and good women.” And he says that “Love <span
id="fr_2387"></span>[2388](#fn_2387.md) is a vice of nature, and the
wretches who fall under its power call the disease a deity.” For in
these words it is shown that stupid people are overcome from ignorance
of pleasure, to which we ought to give no admittance, even though it be
called a god, that is, though it be given by God for the necessity of
procreation. And Xenophon, expressly calling pleasure a vice, says:
“Wretch, what good dost thou know, or what honourable aim hast thou?
which does not even wait for the appetite for sweet things, eating
before being hungry, drinking before being thirsty; and that thou mayest
eat pleasantly, seeking out fine cooks; and that thou mayest drink
pleasantly, procuring costly wines; and in summer runnest about seeking
snow; and that thou mayest sleep pleasantly, not only providest soft
beds, but also supports <span id="fr_2388"></span>[2389](#fn_2388.md) to
the couches.” Whence, as Aristo said, “against the whole tetrachord of
pleasure, pain, fear, and lust, there is need of much exercise and
struggle.”

> <span id="vi.iv.ii.xx-p10.1"></span> “For it is these, it is these
> that go through our bowels,  
> And throw into disorder men’s hearts.”  

<span id="vi.iv.ii.xx-p11"></span>“For the minds of those even who are
deemed grave, pleasure makes waxen,” according to Plato; since “each
pleasure and pain nails to the body the soul” of the man, that does not
sever and crucify himself from the passions. “He that loses his life,”
says the Lord, “shall save it;” either giving it up by exposing it to
danger for the Lord’s sake, as He did for us, or loosing it from
fellowship with its habitual life. For if you would loose, and withdraw,
and separate (for this is what the cross means) your soul from the
delight and pleasure that is in this life, you will possess it, found
and resting in the looked-for hope. And this would be the exercise of
death, if we would be content with those desires which are measured
according to nature alone, which do not pass the limit of those which
are in accordance with nature—by going to excess, or going against
nature—in which the possibility of sinning arises. “We must therefore
put on the panoply of God, that we may be able to stand against the
wiles of the devil; since the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but
mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds, casting down
reasonings, and every lofty thing which exalteth itself against the
knowledge of God, and bringing every thought into captivity unto the
obedience of Christ,” <span id="fr_2389"></span>[2390](#fn_2389.md) says
the divine apostle. There is need of a man who shall use in a
praiseworthy and discriminating manner the things from which passions
take their rise, as riches and poverty, honour and dishonour, health and
sickness, life and death, toil and pleasure. For, in order that we may
treat things, that are different, indifferently, there is need of a
great difference in us, as having been previously afflicted with much
feebleness, and in the distortion of a bad training and nurture
ignorantly indulged ourselves. The simple word, then, of our philosophy
declares the passions to be impressions on the soul that is soft and
yielding, and, as it were, the signatures of the spiritual powers with
whom we have to struggle. For it is the business, in my opinion, of the
malificent powers to endeavour to produce somewhat of their own
constitution in everything, so as to overcome and make their own those
who have renounced them. And it follows, as might be expected, that some
are worsted; but in the case of those who engage in the contest with
more athletic energy, the powers mentioned above, after carrying on the
conflict in all forms, and advancing even as far as the crown wading in
gore, decline the battle, and admire the victors.

<span id="vi.iv.ii.xx-p13"></span>For of objects that are moved, some
are moved by impulse and appearance, as animals; and some by
transposition, as inanimate objects. And of things without life, plants,
they say, are moved by transposition in order to growth, if we will
concede to them that plants are without life. To stones, then, belongs a
permanent state. Plants have a nature; and the irrational animals
possess impulse and perception, and likewise the two characteristics
already specified. <span id="fr_2390"></span>[2391](#fn_2390.md) But the
reasoning faculty, being peculiar to the human soul, ought not to be
impelled similarly with the irrational animals, but ought to
discriminate appearances, and not to be carried away by them. The
powers, then, of which we have spoken hold out beautiful sights, and
honours, and adulteries, and pleasures, and such like alluring
phantasies before facile spirits; <span
id="fr_2391"></span>[2392](#fn_2391.md) as those who drive away cattle hold
out branches to them. Then, having beguiled those incapable of
distinguishing the true from the false pleasure, and the fading and
meretricious from the holy beauty, they lead them into slavery. And each
deceit, by pressing constantly on the spirit, impresses its image on it;
and the soul unwittingly carries about the image of the passion, which
takes its rise from the bait and our consent.

<span id="vi.iv.ii.xx-p16"></span>The adherents of Basilides are in the
habit of <span id="page_372">p. 372</span> <span
id="vi.iv.ii.xx-Page_372"></span>calling the passions appendages: saying
that these are in essence certain spirits attached to the rational soul,
through some original perturbation and confusion; and that, again, other
bastard and heterogeneous natures of spirits grow on to them, like that
of the wolf, the ape, the lion, the goat, whose properties showing
themselves around the soul, they say, assimilate the lusts of the soul
to the likeness of the animals. For they imitate the actions of those
whose properties they bear. And not only are they associated with the
impulses and perceptions of the irrational animals, but they
affect <span id="fr_2392"></span>[2393](#fn_2392.md) the motions and the
beauties of plants, on account of their bearing also the properties of
plants attached to them. They have also the properties of a particular
state, as the hardness of steel. But against this dogma we shall argue
subsequently, when we treat of the soul. At present this only needs to
be pointed out, that man, according to Basilides, preserves the
appearance of a wooden horse, according to the poetic myth, embracing as
he does in one body a host of such different spirits. Accordingly,
Basilides’ son himself, Isidorus, in his book, *About the Soul attached
to us*, while agreeing in the dogma, as if condemning himself, writes in
these words: “For if I persuade any one that the soul is undivided, and
that the passions of the wicked are occasioned by the violence of the
appendages, the worthless among men will have no slight pretence for
saying, ‘I was compelled, I was carried away, I did it against my will,
I acted unwillingly;’ though he himself led the desire of evil things,
and did not fight against the assaults of the appendages. But we must,
by acquiring superiority in the rational part, show ourselves masters of
the inferior creation in us.” For he too lays down the hypothesis of two
souls in us, like the Pythagoreans, at whom we shall glance afterwards.

<span id="vi.iv.ii.xx-p18"></span>Valentinus too, in a letter to certain
people, writes in these very words respecting the appendages: “There is
one good, by whose presence <span id="fr_2393"></span>[2394](#fn_2393.md)
is the manifestation, which is by the Son, and by Him alone can the
heart become pure, by the expulsion of every evil spirit from the heart:
for the multitude of spirits dwelling in it do not suffer it to be pure;
but each of them performs his own deeds, insulting it oft with unseemly
lusts. And the heart seems to be treated somewhat like a caravanserai.
For the latter has holes and ruts made in it, and is often filled with
dung; men living filthily in it, and taking no care for the place as
belonging to others. So fares it with the heart as long as there is no
thought taken for it, being unclean, and the abode of many demons. But
when the only good Father visits it, it is sanctified, and gleams with
light. And he who possesses such a heart is so blessed, that “he shall
see God.” <span id="fr_2394"></span>[2395](#fn_2394.md)

<span id="vi.iv.ii.xx-p21"></span>What, then, let them tell us, is the
cause of such a soul not being cared for from the beginning? Either that
it is not worthy (and somehow a care for it comes to it as from
repentance), or it is a saved nature, as he would have it; and this, of
necessity, from the beginning, being cared for by reason of its
affinity, afforded no entrance to the impure spirits, unless by being
forced and found feeble. For were he to grant that on repentance it
preferred what was better, he will say this unwillingly, being what the
truth we hold teaches; namely, that salvation is from a change due to
obedience, but not from nature. For as the exhalations which arise from
the earth, and from marshes, gather into mists and cloudy masses; so the
vapours of fleshly lusts bring on the soul an evil condition, scattering
about the idols of pleasure before the soul. Accordingly they spread
darkness over the light of intelligence, the spirit attracting the
exhalations that arise from lust, and thickening the masses of the
passions by persistency in pleasures. Gold is not taken from the earth
in the lump, but is purified by smelting; then, when made pure, it is
called gold, the earth being purified. For “Ask, and it shall be given
you,” <span id="fr_2395"></span>[2396](#fn_2395.md) it is said to those who
are able of themselves to choose what is best. And how we say that the
powers of the devil, and the unclean spirits, sow into the sinner’s
soul, requires no more words from me, on adducing as a witness the
apostolic Barnabas (and he was one of the seventy, <span
id="fr_2396"></span>[2397](#fn_2396) and a fellow-worker of Paul.md), who
speaks in these words: “Before we believed in God, the dwelling-place of
our heart was unstable, truly a temple built with hands. For it was full
of idolatry, and was a house of demons, through doing what was opposed
to God.” <span id="fr_2397"></span>[2398](#fn_2397.md)

<span id="vi.iv.ii.xx-p25"></span>He says, then, that sinners exercise
activities appropriate to demons; but he does not say that the spirits
themselves dwell in the soul of the unbeliever. Wherefore he also adds,
“See that the temple of the Lord be gloriously built. Learn, having
received remission of sins; and having set our hope on the Name, let us
become new, created again from the beginning.” For what he says is not
that demons are driven out of us, but that the sins which like them we
commit before believing are remitted. Rightly thus he puts in opposition
what follows: “Wherefore God truly dwells in our home. He dwells in us.
How? The word of His faith, the calling of His promise, the wisdom of
His statutes, the <span id="page_373">p. 373</span> <span
id="vi.iv.ii.xx-Page_373"></span>commandments of His communication,
\[dwell in us\].”

<span id="vi.iv.ii.xx-p26"></span>“I know that I have come upon a
heresy; and its chief was wont to say that he fought with pleasure by
pleasure, this worthy Gnostic advancing on pleasure in feigned combat,
for he said he was a Gnostic; since he said it was no great thing for a
man that had not tried pleasure to abstain from it, but for one who had
mixed in it not to be overcome \[was something\]; and that therefore by
means of it he trained himself in it. The wretched man knew not that he
was deceiving himself by the artfulness of voluptuousness. To this
opinion, then, manifestly Aristippus the Cyrenian adhered—that of the
sophist who boasted of the truth. Accordingly, when reproached for
continually cohabiting with the Corinthian courtezan, he said, “I
possess Lais, and am not possessed by her.”

<span id="vi.iv.ii.xx-p27"></span>Such also are those (who say that they
follow Nicolaus, quoting an adage of the man, which they pervert, <span
id="fr_2398"></span>[2399](#fn_2398.md) “that the flesh must be abused.”
But the worthy man showed that it was necessary to check pleasures and
lusts, and by such training to waste away the impulses and propensities
of the flesh. But they, abandoning themselves to pleasure like goats, as
if insulting the body, lead a life of self-indulgence; not knowing that
the body is wasted, being by nature subject to dissolution; while their
soul is buried in the mire of vice; following as they do the teaching of
pleasure itself, not of the apostolic man. For in what do they differ
from Sardanapalus, whose life is shown in the epigram:—

> <span id="vi.iv.ii.xx-p28.2"></span> “I have what I ate—what I enjoyed
> wantonly;  
> And the pleasures I felt in love. But those  
> Many objects of happiness are left,  
> For I too am dust, who ruled great Ninus.”  

<span id="vi.iv.ii.xx-p29"></span>For the feeling of pleasure is not at
all a necessity, but the accompaniment of certain natural needs—hunger,
thirst, cold, marriage. If, then, it were possible to drink without it,
or take food, or beget children, no other need of it could be shown. For
pleasure is neither a function, nor a state, nor any part of us; but has
been introduced into life as an auxiliary, as they say salt was to
season food. But when it casts off restraint and rules the house, it
generates first concupiscence, which is an irrational propension and
impulse towards that which gratifies it; and it induced Epicurus to lay
down pleasure as the aim of the philosopher. Accordingly he deifies a
sound condition of body, and the certain hope respecting it. For what
else is luxury than the voluptuous gluttony and the superfluous
abundance of those who are abandoned to self-indulgence? Diogenes writes
significantly in a tragedy:—

> <span id="vi.iv.ii.xx-p29.1"></span> “Who to the pleasures of
> effeminate  
> And filthy luxury attached in heart,  
> Wish not to undergo the slightest toil.”  

<span id="vi.iv.ii.xx-p30"></span>And what follows, expressed indeed in
foul language, but in a manner worthy of the voluptuaries.

<span id="vi.iv.ii.xx-p31"></span>Wherefore the divine law appears to me
necessarily to menace with fear, that, by caution and attention, the
philosopher may acquire and retain absence of anxiety, continuing
without fall and without sin in all things. For peace and freedom are
not otherwise won, than by ceaseless and unyielding struggles with our
lusts. For these stout and Olympic antagonists are keener than wasps, so
to speak; and Pleasure especially, not by day only, but by night, is in
dreams with witchcraft ensnaringly plotting and biting. How, then, can
the Greeks any more be right in running down the law, when they
themselves teach that Pleasure is the slave of fear? Socrates
accordingly bids “people guard against enticements to eat when they are
not hungry, and to drink when not thirsty, and the glances and kisses of
the fair, as fitted to inject a deadlier poison than that of scorpions
and spiders.” And Antisthenes chose rather “*to be demented than
delighted.*” And the Theban Crates says:—

> <span id="vi.iv.ii.xx-p31.1"></span> “Master these, exulting in the
> disposition of the soul,  
> Vanquished neither by gold nor by languishing love,  
> Nor are they any longer attendants to the wanton.”  

<span id="vi.iv.ii.xx-p32"></span>And at length infers:—

> <span id="vi.iv.ii.xx-p32.1"></span> “Those, unenslaved and unbended
> by servile Pleasure,  
> Love the immortal kingdom and freedom.”  

<span id="vi.iv.ii.xx-p33"></span>He writes expressly, in other words,
“that the stop <span id="fr_2399"></span>[2400](#fn_2399.md) to the
unbridled propensity to amorousness is hunger or a halter.”

<span id="vi.iv.ii.xx-p35"></span>And the comic poets attest, while they
depreciate the teaching of Zeno the Stoic, to be to the following
effect:—

> <span id="vi.iv.ii.xx-p35.1"></span> “For he philosophizes a vain
> philosophy:  
> He teaches to want food, and gets pupils  
> One loaf, and for seasoning a dry fig, and to drink water.”  

<span id="vi.iv.ii.xx-p36"></span>All these, then, are not ashamed
clearly to confess the advantage which accrues from caution. And the
wisdom which is true and not contrary to reason, trusting not in mere
words and oracular utterances, but in invulnerable armour of defence and
energetic mysteries, and devoting itself to divine commands, and
exercise, and practice, receives a divine power according to its
inspiration from the Word.

<span id="page_374">p. 374</span> <span
id="vi.iv.ii.xx-Page_374"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.ii.xx-p37"></span>Already, then, the ægis of the poetic
Jove is described as

> <span id="vi.iv.ii.xx-p37.1"></span> “Dreadful, crowned all around by
> Terror,  
> And on it Strife and Prowess, and chilling Rout;  
> On it, too, the Gorgon’s head, dread monster,  
> Terrible, dire, the sign of Ægis-bearing Jove.” <span
> id="fr_2400"></span>[2401](#fn_2400.md)  

<span id="vi.iv.ii.xx-p39"></span>But to those, who are able rightly to
understand salvation, I know not what will appear dearer than the
gravity of the Law, and Reverence, which is its daughter. For when one
is said to pitch too high, as also the Lord says, with reference to
certain; so that some of those whose desires are towards Him may not
sing out of pitch and tune, I do not understand it as pitching too high
in reality, but only as spoken with reference to such as will not take
up the divine yoke. For to those, who are unstrung and feeble, what is
medium seems too high; and to those, who are unrighteous, what befalls
them seems severe justice. For those, who, on account of the favour they
entertain for sins, are prone to pardon, suppose truth to be harshness,
and severity to be savageness, and him who does not sin with them, and
is not dragged with them, to be pitiless. Tragedy writes therefore well
of Pluto:—

> <span id="vi.iv.ii.xx-p39.1"></span> “And to what sort of a deity wilt
> thou come, <span id="fr_2401"></span>[2402](#fn_2401.md) dost thou ask,  
> Who knows neither clemency nor favour,  
> But loves bare justice alone.”  

<span id="vi.iv.ii.xx-p41"></span>For although you are not yet able to
do the things enjoined by the Law, yet, considering that the noblest
examples are set before us in it, we are able to nourish and increase
the love of liberty; and so we shall profit more eagerly as far as we
can, inviting some things, imitating some things, and fearing others.
For thus the righteous of the olden time, who lived according to the
law, “were not from a storied oak, or from a rock;” because they wish to
philosophize truly, took and devoted themselves entirely to God, and
were classified under faith. Zeno said well of the Indians, that he
would rather have seen one Indian roasted, than have learned the whole
of the arguments about bearing pain. But we have exhibited before our
eyes every day abundant sources of martyrs that are burnt, impaled,
beheaded. All these the fear inspired by the law,—leading as a pædagogue
to Christ, trained so as to manifest their piety by their blood. “God
stood in the congregation of the gods; He judgeth in the midst of the
gods.” <span id="fr_2402"></span>[2403](#fn_2402.md) Who are they? Those
that are superior to Pleasure, who rise above the passions, who know
what they do—the Gnostics, who are greater than the world. “I said, Ye
are Gods; and all sons of the Highest.” <span
id="fr_2403"></span>[2404](#fn_2403.md) To whom speaks the Lord? To those
who reject as far as possible all that is of man. And the apostle says,
“For ye are not any longer in the flesh, but in the Spirit.” <span
id="fr_2404"></span>[2405](#fn_2404.md) And again he says, “Though in the
flesh, we do not war after the flesh.” <span
id="fr_2405"></span>[2406](#fn_2405.md) “For flesh and blood cannot inherit
the kingdom of God, neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.” <span
id="fr_2406"></span>[2407](#fn_2406.md) “Lo, ye shall die like men,” the
Spirit has said, confuting us.

<span id="vi.iv.ii.xx-p47"></span>We must then exercise ourselves in
taking care about those things which fall under the power of the
passions, fleeing like those who are truly philosophers such articles of
food as excite lust, and dissolute licentiousness in chambering and
luxury; and the sensations that tend to luxury, which are a solid reward
to others, must no longer be so to us. For God’s greatest gift is
self-restraint. For He Himself has said, “I will neyer leave thee, nor
forsake thee,” <span id="fr_2407"></span>[2408](#fn_2407.md) as having
judged thee worthy according to the true election. Thus, then, while we
attempt piously to advance, we shall have put on us the mild yoke of the
Lord from faith to faith, one charioteer driving each of us onward to
salvation, that the meet fruit of beatitude may be won. “*Exercise is*”
according to Hippocrates of Cos, “*not only the health of the body, but
of the soul—fearlessness of labours—a ravenous appetite for food.*”
