##### <span id="iv.ii.iii.xiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIII.—Of Chastity.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.xiii-p1"></span>And concerning chastity, the holy
word teaches us not only not to sin in act, but not even in thought, not
even in the heart to think of any evil, nor look on another man’s wife
with our eyes to lust after her. Solomon, accordingly, who was a king
and a prophet, said: “Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine
eyelids look straight before thee: make straight paths for your
feet.” <span id="fr_660"></span>[661](#fn_660.md) And the voice of the
Gospel teaches still more urgently concerning chastity, saying:
“Whosoever looketh on a woman who is not his own wife, to lust after
her, hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.” <span
id="fr_661"></span>[662](#fn_661.md) “And he that marrieth,” says \[the
Gospel\], “her that is divorced from her husband, committeth adultery;
and whosoever putteth away his wife, saving for the cause of
fornication, causeth her to commit adultery.” <span
id="fr_662"></span>[663](#fn_662.md) Because Solomon says: “Can a man take
fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned? Or can one walk upon
hot coals, and his feet not be burned? So he that goeth in to a married
woman shall not be innocent.” <span id="fr_663"></span>[664](#fn_663.md)
