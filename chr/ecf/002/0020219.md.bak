##### <span id="v.iii.xi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XI.—Recapitulation.

<span id="v.iii.xi-p1"></span>If, then, by means of that which is by
nature first and that which follows from it, each of the points
investigated has been proved, it is very evident that the resurrection
of dissolved bodies is a work which the Creator can perform, and can
will, and such as is worthy of Him: for by these considerations the
falsehood of the contrary opinion has been shown, and the absurdity of
the position taken by disbelievers. For why should I speak of their
correspondence each with each, and of their connection with one another?
If indeed we ought to use the word connection, as though they were
separated by some difference of nature; and not rather say, that what
God can do He can also will, and that what God can will it is perfectly
possible for Him to do, and that it is accordant with the dignity of Him
who wills it. That to discourse concerning the truth is one thing, and
to discourse in defence of it is another, has been sufficiently
explained in the remarks already made, as also in what respects they
differ from each other, and when and in dealing with whom they are
severally useful; but perhaps there is no reason why, with a view to the
general certainty, and because of the connection of what has been said
with what remains, we should not make a fresh beginning from these same
points and those which are allied to them. To the one kind of argument
it naturally pertains to hold the foremost place, to the other to attend
upon the first, and clear the way, and to remove whatever is obstructive
or hostile. The discourse concerning the truth, as being necessary to
all men for certainty and safety, holds the first place, whether in
nature, or order, or usefulness: in nature, as furnishing the knowledge
of the subject; in order, as being in those things and along with those
things which it informs us of; in usefulness, as being a guarantee of
certainty and safety to those who become acquainted with it. The
discourse in defence of the truth is inferior in nature and force, for
the refutation of falsehood is less important than the establishment of
truth; and second in order, for it employs its strength against those
who hold false opinions, and false opinions are an aftergrowth from
another sowing and from degeneration. But, notwithstanding all this, it
is often placed first, and sometimes is found more useful, because it
removes and clears away beforehand the disbelief which disquiets some
minds, and the doubt or false opinion of such as have but recently come
over. And yet each of them is referrible to the same end, for the
refutation of falsehood and the establishment of truth both have piety
for their object: not, indeed, that they are absolutely one and the
same, but the one is necessary, as I have said, to all who believe, and
to those who are concerned about the truth and their own salvation; but
the other proves to be more useful on some occasions, and to some
persons, and in dealing with some. Thus much by way of recapitulation,
to recall what has been already said. We must now pass on to what we
proposed, and show the truth of the doctrine concerning the
resurrection, both from the cause itself, according to which, and on
account of which, the first man and his posterity were created, although
they were not brought into existence in the same manner, and from the
common nature of all men as men; and further, from the judgment of their
Maker upon them according to the time each has lived, and according to
the rules by which each has regulated his behaviour,—a judgment which no
one can doubt will be just.
