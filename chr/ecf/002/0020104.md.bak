##### <span id="iv.ii.ii.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.—Hesiod on the Origin of the World.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.vi-p1"></span>And in a certain way he indeed admits
matter \[as self-existent\] and the creation of the world \[without a
creator\], saying: <span id="fr_555"></span>[556](#fn_555.md) —

> <span id="iv.ii.ii.vi-p2.1"></span> “First of all things was chaos
> made, and next  
> Broad-bosom’d earth’s foundations firm were fixed,  
> Where safely the immortals dwell for aye,  
> Who in the snowy-peak’d Olympus stay.  
> Afterwards gloomy Tartarus had birth  
> In the recesses of broad-pathwayed earth,  
> And Love, ev’n among gods most beauteous still,  
> Who comes all-conquering, bending mind and will,  
> Delivering from care, and giving then  
> Wise counsel in the breasts of gods and men.  
> From chaos Erebus and night were born,  
> From night and Erebus sprung air and morn.  
> Earth in her likeness made the starry heaven,  
> That unto all things shelter might be given,  
> And that the blessed gods might there repose.  
> The lofty mountains by her power arose,  
> For the wood-nymphs she made the pleasant caves,  
> Begot the sterile sea with all his waves,  
> Loveless; but when by heaven her love was sought,  
> Then the deep-eddying ocean forth she brought.”  

<span id="iv.ii.ii.vi-p3"></span>And saying this, he has not yet
explained by whom all this was made. For if chaos existed in the
beginning, and matter of some sort, being uncreated, was previously
existing, who was it that effected the change on its condition, and gave
it a different order and shape? Did matter itself alter its own form and
arrange itself into a world (for Jupiter was born, not only long after
matter, but long after the world and many men; and so, too, was his
father Saturn), or was there some ruling power which made it; I mean, of
course, God, who also fashioned it into a world? Besides, he is found in
every way to talk nonsense, and to contradict himself. For when he
mentions earth, and sky, and sea, he gives us to understand that from
these the gods were produced; and from these again \[the gods\] he
declares that certain very dreadful men were sprung,—the race of the
Titans and the Cyclopes, and a crowd of giants, and of the Egyptian
gods,—or, rather, vain men, as Apollonides, surnamed Horapius, mentions
in the book entitled *Semenouthi*, and in his other histories concerning
the worship of the Egyptians and their kings, and the vain labours in
which they engaged. <span id="fr_556"></span>[557](#fn_556.md)

of Wolf and Fell, who understand the pyramids to be referred to.
