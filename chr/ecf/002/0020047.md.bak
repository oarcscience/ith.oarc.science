##### <span id="iii.ii.xi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XI.—The Sin of Men Due Not to Fate, But to Free-Will.

<span id="iii.ii.xi-p1"></span>How, then, shall I admit this nativity
according to Fate, when I see such managers of Fate? I do not wish to be
a king; I am not anxious to be rich; I decline military command; I
detest fornication; I am not impelled by an insatiable love of gain to
go to sea; I do not contend for chaplets; I am free from a mad thirst
for fame; I despise death; I am superior to every kind of disease; grief
does not consume my soul. Am I a slave, I endure servitude. Am I free, I
do not make a vaunt of my good birth. I see that the same sun is for
all, and one death for all, whether they live in pleasure or
destitution. The rich man sows, and the poor man partakes of the same
sowing. The wealthiest die, and beggars have the same limits to their
life. The rich lack many things, and are glorious only through the
estimation they are held in; <span id="fr_452"></span>[453](#fn_452.md) but
the poor man and he who has very moderate desires, seeking as he does
only the things suited to his lot, more easily obtains his purpose. How
is it that you are fated to be sleepless through avarice? Why are you
fated to grasp at things often, and often to die? Die to the world,
repudiating the madness that is in it. Live to God, and by apprehending
Him lay aside your old nature. <span id="fr_453"></span>[454](#fn_453.md)
We were not created to die, but we die by our own <span id="page_70">p.
70</span> <span id="iii.ii.xi-Page_70"></span>fault. <span
id="fr_454"></span>[455](#fn_454.md) Our free-will has destroyed us; we who
were free have become slaves; we have been sold through sin. Nothing
evil has been created by God; we ourselves have manifested wickedness;
but we, who have manifested it, are able again to reject it.
