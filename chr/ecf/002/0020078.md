##### <span id="iii.ii.xlii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XLII.—Concluding Statement as to the Author.

<span id="iii.ii.xlii-p1"></span>These things, O Greeks, I Tatian, a
disciple of the barbarian philosophy, <span
id="fr_515"></span>[516](#fn_515) have composed for you. I was born in
the land of the Assyrians, having been first instructed in your
doctrines, <span id="page_82">p. 82</span> <span
id="iii.ii.xlii-Page_82"></span>and afterwards in those which I now
undertake to proclaim. Henceforward, knowing who God is and what is His
work, I present myself to you prepared for an examination <span
id="fr_516"></span>[517](#fn_516) concerning my doctrines, while I
adhere immoveably to that mode of life which is according to God. <span
id="fr_517"></span>[518](#fn_517)

“<span id="iii.ii.xlii-p3.1"></span>Que la trompette du jugement sonne
quand elle voudra, je viendrai *ce livra a la main*, me presenter devant
le souverain Juge.” *Confessions*, livre i. p. 2.\]

<span id="iii.ii.xlii-p4"></span> \[“Adhere *immoveably*.” Alas! “let
him that thinketh he standeth”, etc. But I cannot part with Tatian nor
think of Tertullian without recalling David’s threnode: “There the
shield of the mighty is vilely cast away … . I am distressed for thee,
my brother: … very pleasant hast thou been unto me … How are the mighty
fallen, and the weapons of war perished!” Our own sad times have taught
us similar lamentations for some who seemed for a time to be “burning
and shining lights.” God be merciful to poor frail men.\]
