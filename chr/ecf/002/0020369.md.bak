<span id="vi.iv.iv.xviii"></span>

##### <span id="vi.iv.iv.xviii-p0.1"></span>Chap. XIX.—Women as well as Men Capable of Perfection.

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xviii-p1"></span>In this perfection it is possible
for man and woman equally to share. It is not only Moses, then, that
heard from God, “I have spoken to thee once, and twice, saying, I have
seen this people, and lo, it is stiff-necked. Suffer me to exterminate
them, and blot out their name from under heaven; and I will make thee
into a great and wonderful nation much greater than this;” who answers
not regarding himself, but the common salvation: “By no means, O Lord;
forgive this people their sin, or blot me out of the book of the
living.” <span id="fr_2862"></span>[2863](#fn_2862.md) How great was his
perfection, in wishing to die together with the people, rather than be
saved alone!

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xviii-p3"></span>But Judith too, who became perfect
among women, in the siege of the city, at the entreaty of the elders
went forth into the strangers’ camp, despising all danger for her
country’s sake, giving herself into the enemy’s hand in faith in God;
and straightway she obtained the reward of her faith,—though a woman,
prevailing over the enemy of her faith, and gaining possession of the
head of Holofernes. And again, Esther perfect by faith, who rescued
Israel from the power of the king and the satrap’s cruelty: a woman
alone, afflicted with fastings, <span
id="fr_2863"></span>[2864](#fn_2863.md) held back ten thousand armed <span
id="fr_2864"></span>[2865](#fn_2864.md) hands, annulling by her faith the
tyrant’s decree; him indeed she appeased, Haman she restrained, and
Israel she preserved scathless by her perfect prayer to God. I pass over
in silence Susanna and the sister of Moses, since the latter was the
prophet’s associate in commanding the host, being superior to all the
women among the Hebrews who were in repute for their wisdom; and the
former in her surpassing modesty, going even to death condemned by
licentious admirers, remained the unwavering martyr of chastity.

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xviii-p6"></span>Dion, too, the philosopher, tells
that a certain woman Lysidica, through excess of modesty, bathed in her
clothes; and that Philotera, when she was to enter the bath, gradually
drew back her tunic as the water covered the naked parts; and then
rising by degrees, put it on. And did not Leæna of Attica manfully bear
the torture? She being privy to the conspiracy of Harmodius and
Aristogeiton against Hipparchus, uttered not a word, though severely
tortured. And they say that the Argolic women, under the guidance of
Telesilla the poetess, turned to flight the doughty Spartans by merely
showing themselves; and that she produced in them fearlessness of death.
Similarly speaks he who composed the Danais respecting the daughters of
Danaus:—

> <span id="vi.iv.iv.xviii-p6.1"></span> “And then the daughters of
> Danaus swiftly armed themselves,  
> Before the fair-flowing river, majestic Nile <span
> id="fr_2865"></span>[2866](#fn_2865.md) ,”  

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xviii-p8"></span>and so forth.

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xviii-p9"></span>And the rest of the poets sing of
Atalanta’s swiftness in the chase, of Anticlea’s love for children, of
Alcestis’s love for her husband, of the courage of Makæria and of the
Hyacinthides. What shall I say? Did not Theano the Pythagorean make such
progress in philosophy, that to him who looked intently at her, and
said, “Your arm is beautiful,” she answered “Yes, but it is not public.”
Characterized by the same propriety, there is also reported the
following reply. <span id="fr_2866"></span>[2867](#fn_2866.md) When asked
when a woman after being with her husband attends the Thesmophoria,
said, “From her own husband at once, from a stranger never.” Themisto
too, of Lampsacus, the daughter of Zoilus, the wife of Leontes of
Lampsacus, studied the Epicurean philosophy, as Myia the daughter of
Theano the Pythagorean, and Arignote, who wrote the history of
Dionysius.

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xviii-p11"></span>And the daughters of Diodorus, who
was called Kronus, all became dialecticians, as Philo the dialectician
says in the *Menexenus*, whose names are mentioned as follows—Menexene,
Argia, Theognis, Artemesia, Pantaclea. I also recollect a female
Cynic,—she was called Hipparchia, a Maronite, the wife of Crates,—in
whose case the so-called dog-wedding was celebrated in the Pœcile. Arete
of Cyrene, too, the daughter of Aristippus, educated her son Aristippus,
who was surnamed Mother-taught. Lastheneia of Arcis, and Axiothea of
Phlius, studied philosophy with Plato. Besides, Aspasia of Miletus, of
whom the writers of comedy write much, was trained by Socrates in
philosophy, by Pericles in rhetoric. I omit, on account of the length of
the discourse, the rest; enumerating neither the poetesses Corinna,
Telesilla, Myia, and Sappho; nor the painters, as Irene the daughter of
Cratinus, and Anaxandra the daughter of Nealces, according to the
account of <span id="page_432">p. 432</span> <span
id="vi.iv.iv.xviii-Page_432"></span>Didymus in the Symposiaci. The
daughter of Cleobulus, the sage and monarch of the Lindii, was not
ashamed to wash the feet of her father’s guests. Also the wife of
Abraham, the blessed Sarah, in her own person prepared the cakes baked
in the ashes for the angels; and princely maidens among the Hebrews fed
sheep. Whence also the Nausicaä of Homer went to the washing-tubs.

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xviii-p12"></span>The wise woman, then, will first
choose to persuade her husband to be her associate in what is conducive
to happiness. And should that be found impracticable, let her by herself
earnestly aim at virtue, gaining her husband’s consent in everything, so
as never to do anything against his will, with exception of what is
reckoned as contributing to virtue and salvation. But if one keeps from
such a mode of life either wife or maid-servant, whose heart is set on
it; what such a person in that case plainly does is nothing else than
determine to drive her away from righteousness and sobriety, and to
choose to make his own house wicked and licentious.

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xviii-p13"></span>It is not then possible that man or
woman can be conversant with anything whatever, without the advantage of
education, and application, and training; and virtue, we have said,
depends not on others, but on ourselves above all. Other things one can
repress, by waging war against them; but with what depends on one’s
self, this is entirely out of the question, even with the most strenuous
persistence. For the gift is one conferred by God, and not in the power
of any other. Whence licentiousness should be regarded as the evil of no
other one than of him who is guilty of licentiousness; and temperance,
on the other hand, as the good of him who is able to practice it.
