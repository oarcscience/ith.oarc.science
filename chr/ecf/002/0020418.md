##### <span id="vi.iv.vii.viii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VIII.—The Gnostic So Addicted to Truth as Not to Need to Use an Oath.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.viii-p1"></span>The man of proved character in such
piety is far from being apt to lie and to swear. For an oath is a
decisive affirmation, with the taking of the divine name. For how can
he, that is once faithful, show himself unfaithful, so as to require an
oath; and so that his life may not be a sure and decisive oath? He
lives, and walks, and shows the trustworthiness of his affirmation in an
unwavering and sure life and speech. And if the wrong lies in the
judgment of one who does and says \[something\], and not in the
suffering of one who has been wronged, <span
id="fr_3579"></span>[3580](#fn_3579) he will neither lie nor commit
perjury so as to wrong the Deity, knowing that it by nature is incapable
of being harmed. Nor yet will he lie or commit any transgression, for
the sake of the neighbour whom he has learned to love, though he be not
on terms of intimacy. Much more, consequently, will he not lie or
perjure himself on his own account, since he never with his will can be
found doing wrong to himself.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.viii-p3"></span>But he does not even swear,
preferring to make averment, in affirmation by “yea,” and in denial by
“nay.” For it is an oath to swear, or to produce <span
id="fr_3580"></span>[3581](#fn_3580) anything from the mind in the way
of confirmation in the shape of an oath. It suffices, then, with him, to
add to an affirmation or denial the expression “I say truly,” for
confirmation to those who do not perceive the certainty of his answer.
For he ought, I think, to maintain a life calculated to inspire
confidence towards those without, so that an oath may not even be asked;
and towards himself and those with whom he associates <span
id="fr_3581"></span>[3582](#fn_3581) good feeling, which is voluntary
righteousness.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.viii-p6"></span>The Gnostic swears truly, but is not
apt to swear, having rarely recourse to an oath, just as we have said.
And his speaking truth on oath arises from his accord with the truth.
This speaking truth on oath, then, is found to be the result of
correctness in duties. Where, then, is the necessity for an oath to him
who lives in accordance with the extreme of truth? <span
id="fr_3582"></span>[3583](#fn_3582) He, then, that does not even swear
will be far from perjuring himself. And he who does not transgress in
what is ratified by compacts, will never swear; since the ratification
of the violation and of the fulfilment is by actions; as certainly lying
and perjury in affirming and swearing are contrary to duty. But he who
lives justly, transgressing in none of his duties, when the judgment of
truth is scrutinized, swears truth by his acts. Accordingly, testimony
by the tongue is in his case superfluous.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.viii-p8"></span>Therefore, persuaded always that God
is everywhere, and fearing not to speak the truth, and knowing that it
is unworthy of him to lie, he is satisfied with the divine consciousness
and his own alone <span id="fr_3583"></span>[3584](#fn_3583) And so he
lies not, nor does aught contrary to his compacts. And so he swears not
even when asked for his oath; nor does he <span id="page_538">p.
538</span> <span id="vi.iv.vii.viii-Page_538"></span>ever deny, so as to
speak falsehood, though he should die by tortures.
