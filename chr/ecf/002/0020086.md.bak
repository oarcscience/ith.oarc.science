##### <span id="iv.ii.i.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.—Nature of God.

<span id="iv.ii.i.iii-p1"></span>You will say, then, to me, “Do you, who
see God, explain to me the appearance of God.” Hear, O man. The
appearance of God is ineffable and indescribable, and cannot be seen by
eyes of flesh. For in glory He is incomprehensible, in greatness
unfathomable, in height inconceivable, in power incomparable, in wisdom
<span id="page_90">p. 90</span> <span
id="iv.ii.i.iii-Page_90"></span>unrivalled, in goodness inimitable, in
kindness unutterable. For if I say He is Light, I name but His own work;
if I call Him Word, I name but His sovereignty; if I call Him Mind, I
speak but of His wisdom; if I say He is Spirit, I speak of His breath;
if I call Him Wisdom, I speak of His offspring; if I call Him Strength,
I speak of His sway; if I call Him Power, I am mentioning His activity;
if Providence, I but mention His goodness; if I call Him Kingdom, I but
mention His glory; if I call Him Lord, I mention His being judge; if I
call Him Judge, I speak of Him as being just; if I call Him Father, I
speak of all things as being from Him; <span
id="fr_528"></span>[529](#fn_528.md) if I call Him Fire, I but mention His
anger. You will say, then, to me, “Is God angry?” Yes; He is angry with
those who act wickedly, but He is good, and kind, and merciful, to those
who love and fear Him; for He is a chastener <span
id="fr_529"></span>[530](#fn_529.md) of the godly, and father of the
righteous; but he is a judge and punisher of the impious.

and His punishment of the wicked.
