##### <span id="iv.ii.iii.xxiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXIV.—Chronology from Adam.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.xxiv-p1"></span>Adam lived till he begat a
son, <span id="fr_686"></span>[687](#fn_686.md) 230 years. And his son
Seth, 205. And his son Enos, 190. And his son Cainan, 170. And his son
Mahaleel, 165. And his son Jared, 162. And his son Enoch, 165. And his
son Methuselah, 167. And his son Lamech, 188. And Lamech’s son was Noah,
of whom we have spoken above, who begat Shem when 500 years old. During
Noah’s life, in his 600th year, the flood came. The total number of
years, therefore, till the flood, was 2242. And immediately after the
flood, Shem, who was 100 years old, begat Arphaxad. And Arphaxad, when
135 years old, begat Salah. And Salah begat a son when 130. And his son
Eber, when 134. And from him the Hebrews name their race. And his son
Phaleg begat a son when 130. And his son Reu, when 132 And his son
Serug, when 130. And his son Nahor, when 75. And his son Terah, when 70.
And his son Abraham, our patriarch, begat Isaac when he was 100 years
old. Until Abraham, therefore, there are 3278 years. The fore-mentioned
Isaac lived until he begat a son, 60 years, and begat Jacob. Jacob, till
the migration into Egypt, of which we have spoken above, lived 130
years. And the sojourning of the Hebrews in Egypt lasted 430 years; and
after their departure from the land of Egypt they spent 40 years in the
wilderness, as it is called. All these years, therefore, amount to
3,938. And at that time, Moses having died, Jesus the sun of Nun
succeeded to his rule, and governed them 27 years. And after Jesus, when
the people had transgressed the commandments of God, they served the
king of Mesopotamia, by name Chusarathon, 8 years. Then, on the <span

id="iv.ii.iii.xxiv-Page_119"></span>repentance of the people, they had
judges: Gothonoel, 40 years; Eglon, 18 years; Aoth, 8 years. Then having
sinned, they were subdued by strangers for 20 years. Then Deborah judged
them 40 years. Then they served the Midianites 7 years. Then Gideon
judged them 40 years; Abimelech, 3 years; Thola, 22 years; Jair, 22
years. Then the Philistines and Ammonites ruled them 18 years. After
that Jephthah judged them 6 years; Esbon, 7 years; Ailon, 10 years;
Abdon, 8 years. Then strangers ruled them 40 years. Then Samson judged
them 20 years. Then there was peace among them for 40 years. Then Samera
judged them one year; Eli, 20 years; Samuel, 12 years.
