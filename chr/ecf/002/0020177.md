##### <span id="v.ii.vii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VII.—Superiority of the Christian Doctrine Respecting God.

<span id="v.ii.vii-p1"></span>Since, therefore, the unity of the Deity
is confessed by almost all, even against their will, when they come to
treat of the first principles of the universe, and we in our turn
likewise assert that He who arranged this universe is God,—why is it
that they can say and write with impunity what they please concerning
the Deity, but that against us a law lies in force, though we are able
to demonstrate what we apprehend and justly believe, namely that there
is one God, with proofs and reason accordant with truth? For poets and
philosophers, as to other subjects so also to this, have applied
themselves in the way of conjecture, moved, by reason of their affinity
with the afflatus from God, <span id="fr_717"></span>[718](#fn_717.md) each
one by his own soul, to try whether he could find out and apprehend the
truth; but they have not been found competent fully to apprehend it,
because they thought fit to learn, not from God concerning God, but each
one from himself; hence they came each to his own conclusion respecting
God, and matter, and forms, and the world. But we have for witnesses of
the things we apprehend and believe, prophets, men who have pronounced
concerning God and the things of God, guided by the Spirit of God. And
you too will admit, excelling all others as you do in intelligence and
in piety towards the true God (<span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.vii-p2.1"></span>τὸ ὄντως θεῖον</span>), that it would be
irrational for us to cease to believe in the Spirit from God, who moved
the mouths of the prophets like musical instruments, and to give heed to
mere human opinions.
