##### <span id="v.ii.xiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIII.—Why the Christians Do Not Offer Sacrifices.

<span id="v.ii.xiii-p1"></span>But, as most of those who charge us with
atheism, and that because they have not even the dreamiest conception of
what God is, and are doltish and utterly unacquainted with natural and
divine things, and such as measure piety by the rule of sacrifices,
charges us with not acknowledging the same gods as the cities, be
pleased to attend to the following considerations, O emperors, on both
points. And first, as to our not sacrificing: the Framer and Father of
<span id="page_135">p. 135</span> <span
id="v.ii.xiii-Page_135"></span>this universe does not need blood, nor
the odour of burnt-offerings, nor the fragrance of flowers and
incense, <span id="fr_736"></span>[737](#fn_736) forasmuch as He is
Himself perfect fragrance, needing nothing either within or without; but
the noblest sacrifice <span id="fr_737"></span>[738](#fn_737) to Him is
for us to know who stretched out and vaulted the heavens, and fixed the
earth in its place like a centre, who gathered the water into seas and
divided the light from the darkness, who adorned the sky with stars and
made the earth to bring forth seed of every kind, who made animals and
fashioned man. When, holding God to be this Framer of all things, who
preserves them in being and superintends them all by knowledge and
administrative skill, we “lift up holy hands” to Him, what need has He
further of a hecatomb?

> <span id="v.ii.xiii-p3.1"></span> “For they, when mortals have
> transgress’d or fail’d  
> To do aright, by sacrifice and pray’r,  
> Libations and burnt-offerings, may be soothed.” <span
> id="fr_738"></span>[739](#fn_738)  

<span id="v.ii.xiii-p5"></span>And what have I to do with holocausts,
which God does not stand in need of?—though indeed it does behove us to
offer a bloodless sacrifice and “the service of our reason.” <span
id="fr_739"></span>[740](#fn_739)

oblation: hence to offering of Christ’s natural blood, as the Latins now
teach, was unknown to Athenagoras.\]
