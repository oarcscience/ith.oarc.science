##### <span id="iv.ii.iii.xxviii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXVIII.—Leading Chronological Epochs.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.xxviii-p1"></span>And from the foundation of the
world the whole time is thus traced, so far as its main epochs are
concerned. From the creation of the world to the deluge were 2242 years.
And from the deluge to the time when Abraham our forefather begat a son,
1036 years. And from Isaac, Abraham’s son, to the time when the people
dwelt with Moses in the desert, 660 years. And from the death of Moses
and the rule of Joshua the son of Nun, to the death of the patriarch
David, 498 years. And from the death of David and the reign of Solomon
to the sojourning of the people in the land of Babylon, 518 years 6
months 10 days. And from the government of Cyrus to the death of the
Emperor Aurelius Verus, 744 years. All the years from the creation of
the world amount to a total of 5698 years, and the odd months and
days. <span id="fr_688"></span>[689](#fn_688.md)

computation of our author makes the creation, <span class="sc"><span

<span class="sc"><span id="iv.ii.iii.xxviii-p2.3"></span>b.c.</span>
5411, inspires us with great respect for Theophilus, by the degree of
accuracy he attained, using (the LXX.) the same authority as his base.
Slight variations in the copies used in his day might have led, one
would think, to greater discrepancies.\]
