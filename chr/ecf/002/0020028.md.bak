#### <span id="ii.iv.vi-p0.1"></span>Similitude Sixth.

##### <span id="ii.iv.vi-p0.2"></span>Of the Two Classes of Voluptuous Men, and of Their Death, Falling Away, and the Duration of Their Punishment.

##### <span id="ii.iv.vi-p0.3"></span>Chap. I.

<span id="ii.iv.vi-p1"></span>Sitting in my house, and glorifying the
Lord for all that I had seen, and reflecting on the commandments, that
they are excellent, and powerful, and glorious, and able to save a man’s
soul, I said within myself, “I shall be blessed if I walk in these
commandments, and every one who walks in them will be blessed.” While I
was saying these words to myself, I suddenly see him sitting beside me,
and hear him thus speak: “Why are you in doubt about the commandments
which I gave you? They are excellent: have no doubt about them at all,
but put on faith in the Lord, and you will walk in them, for I will
strengthen you in them. These commandments are beneficial to those who
intend to repent: for if they do not walk in them, their repentance is
in vain. You, therefore, who repent cast away the wickedness of this
world which wears you out; and by putting on all the virtues of a holy
life, you will be able to keep these commandments, and will no longer
add to the number of your sins. Walk, <span
id="fr_288"></span>[289](#fn_288.md) therefore, in these commandments of
mine, and you will live unto God. All these things have been spoken to
you by me.” And after he had uttered these words, he said to me, “Let us
go into the fields, and I will show you the shepherds of the flocks.”
“Let us go, sir,” I replied. And we came to a certain plain, and he
showed me a young man, a shepherd, clothed in a suit of garments of a
yellow colour: and he was herding very many sheep, and these sheep were
feeding luxuriously, as it were, and riotously, and merrily skipping
hither and thither. The shepherd himself was merry, because of his
flock; and the appearance of the shepherd was joyous, and he was running
about amongst his flock. \[And other sheep I saw rioting and luxuriating
in one place, but not, however, leaping about. <span
id="fr_289"></span>[290](#fn_289.md) \]

##### <span id="ii.iv.vi-p3.1"></span>Chap. II.

<span id="ii.iv.vi-p4"></span>And he said to me, “Do you see this
shepherd?” “I see him, sir,” I said. “This,” he answered, “is the
angel <span id="fr_290"></span>[291](#fn_290.md) of luxury and deceit:
<span id="page_37">p. 37</span> <span id="ii.iv.vi-Page_37"></span>he
wears out the souls of the servants of God, and perverts them from the
truth, deceiving them with wicked desires, through which they will
perish; for they forget the commandments of the living God, and walk in
deceits and empty luxuries; and they are ruined by the angel, some being
brought to death, others to corruption.” <span
id="fr_291"></span>[292](#fn_291.md) I said to him, “Sir, I do not know the
meaning of these words, ‘to death, and to corruption.’” “Listen,” he
said. “The sheep which you saw merry and leaping about, are those which
have torn themselves away from God for ever, and have delivered
themselves over to luxuries and deceits <span
id="fr_292"></span>[293](#fn_292.md) \[of this world. Among them there is
no return to life through repentance, because they have added to their
other sins, and blasphemed the name of the Lord. Such men therefore, are
appointed unto death. <span id="fr_293"></span>[294](#fn_293.md) And the
sheep which you saw not leaping, but feeding in one place, are they who
have delivered themselves over to luxury and deceit\], but have
committed no blasphemy against the Lord. These have been perverted from
the truth: among them there is the hope of repentance, by which it is
possible to live. Corruption, then, has a hope of a kind of
renewal, <span id="fr_294"></span>[295](#fn_294.md) but death has
everlasting ruin.” Again I went forward a little way, and he showed me a
tall shepherd, somewhat savage in his appearance, clothed in a white
goatskin, and having a wallet on his shoulders, and a very hard staff
with branches, and a large whip. And he had a very sour look, so that I
was afraid of him, so forbidding was his aspect. This shepherd,
accordingly, was receiving the sheep from the young shepherd, those,
viz., that were rioting and luxuriating, but not leaping; and he cast
them into a precipitous place, full of thistles and thorns, so that it
was impossible to extricate the sheep from the thorns and thistles; but
they were completely entangled amongst them. These, accordingly, thus
entangled, pastured amongst the thorns and thistles, and were
exceedingly miserable, being beaten by him; and he drove them hither and
thither, and gave them no rest; and, altogether, these sheep were in a
wretched plight.

##### <span id="ii.iv.vi-p9.4"></span>Chap. III.

<span id="ii.iv.vi-p10"></span>Seeing them, therefore, so beaten and so
badly used, I was grieved for them, because they were so tormented, and
had no rest at all. And I said to the Shepherd who talked with me, “Sir,
who is this shepherd, who is so pitiless and severe, and so completely
devoid of compassion for these sheep?” “This,” he replied, “is the angel
of punishment; <span id="fr_295"></span>[296](#fn_295.md) and he belongs to
the just angels, and is appointed to punish. He accordingly takes those
who wander away from God, and who have walked in the desires and deceits
of this world, and chastises them as they deserve with terrible and
diverse punishments.” “I would know, sir,” I said, “Of what nature are
these diverse tortures and punishments?” “Hear,” he said, “the various
tortures and punishments. The tortures are such as occur during
life. <span id="fr_296"></span>[297](#fn_296.md) For some are punished with
losses, others with want, others with sicknesses of various kinds, and
others with all kinds of disorder and confusion; others are insulted by
unworthy persons, and exposed to suffering in many other ways: for many,
becoming unstable in their plans, try many things, and none of them at
all succeed, and they say they are not prosperous in their undertakings;
and it does not occur to their minds that they have done evil deeds, but
they blame the Lord. <span id="fr_297"></span>[298](#fn_297.md) When,
therefore, they have been afflicted with all kinds of affliction, then
are they delivered unto me for good training, and they are made strong
in the faith of the Lord; and <span id="fr_298"></span>[299](#fn_298.md)
for the rest of the days of their life they are subject to the Lord with
pure hearts, and are successful in all their undertakings, obtaining
from the Lord everything they ask; and then they glorify the Lord, that
they were delivered to me, and no longer suffer any evil.”

##### <span id="ii.iv.vi-p14.1"></span>Chap. IV.

<span id="ii.iv.vi-p15"></span>I said to him, “Sir, explain this also to
me.” “What is it you ask?” he said. “Whether, sir,” I continued, “they
who indulge in luxury, and who are deceived, are tortured for the same
period of time that they have indulged in luxury and deceit?” He said to
me, “They are tortured in the same manner.” <span
id="fr_299"></span>[300](#fn_299.md) \[“They are tormented <span
id="page_38">p. 38</span> <span id="ii.iv.vi-Page_38"></span>much less,
sir,” I replied; <span id="fr_300"></span>[301](#fn_300.md) \] “for those
who are so luxurious and who forget God ought to be tortured
seven-fold.” He said to me “You are foolish, and do not understand the
power of torment.” “Why, sir,” I said, “if I had understood it, I would
not have asked you to show me.” “Hear,” he said, “the power of both. The
time of luxury and deceit is one hour; but the hour of torment is
equivalent to thirty days. If, accordingly, a man indulge in luxury for
one day, and be deceived and be tortured for one day, the day of his
torture is equivalent to a whole year. For all the days of luxury,
therefore, there are as many years of torture to be undergone. You see,
then,” he continued, “that the time of luxury and deceit is very
short, <span id="fr_301"></span>[302](#fn_301.md) but that of punishment
and torture long.”

##### <span id="ii.iv.vi-p18.3"></span>Chap. V.

<span id="ii.iv.vi-p19"></span>“Still,” I said, “I do not quite
understand about the time of deceit, and luxury, and torture; explain it
to me more clearly.” He answered, and said to me, “Your folly is
persistent; and you do not wish to purify your heart, and serve God.
Have a care,” he added, “lest the time be fulfilled, and you be found
foolish. Hear now,” he added, “as you desire, that you may understand
these things. He who indulges in luxury, and is deceived for one day,
and who does what he wishes, is clothed with much foolishness, and does
not understand the act which he does until the morrow; for he forgets
what he did the day before. For luxury and deceit have no memories, on
account of the folly with which they are clothed; but when punishment
and torture cleave to a man for one day, he is punished and tortured for
a year; for punishment and torture have powerful memories. While
tortured and punished, therefore, for a whole year, he remembers at
last <span id="fr_302"></span>[303](#fn_302.md) his luxury and deceit, and
knows that on their account he suffers evil. Every man, therefore, who
is luxurious and deceived is thus tormented, because, although having
life, they have given themselves over to death.” “What kinds of luxury,
sir,” I asked, “are hurtful?” “Every act of a man which he performs with
pleasure,” he replied, “is an act of luxury; for the sharp-tempered man,
when gratifying his tendency, indulges in luxury; and the adulterer, and
the drunkard, and the back-biter, and the liar, and the covetous man,
and the thief, and he who does things like these, gratifies his peculiar
propensity, and in so doing indulges in luxury. All these acts of luxury
are hurtful to the servants of God. On account of these deceits,
therefore, do they suffer, who are punished and tortured. And there are
also acts of luxury which save men; for many who do good indulge in
luxury, being carried away by their own pleasure: <span
id="fr_303"></span>[304](#fn_303.md) this luxury, however, is beneficial to
the servants of God, and gains life for such a man; but the injurious
acts of luxury before enumerated bring tortures and punishment upon
them; and if they continue in them and do not repent, they bring death
upon themselves.”

life is death.”

id="ii.iv.vi-p8.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iv.vi-p9"></span> Pseudo-Athanasius has, “Corruption,
therefore, has a hope of resurrection up to a certain point.” \[Death
here must mean final apostasy ([Heb. vi.
4-6](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#004.md)<span id="ii.iv.vi-p9.1"></span>,
x. 26–31, xii. 15–17). But a certain death-in-life, which is not final,
is instanced in [Rev. iii. 1](../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#001.md)<span
id="ii.iv.vi-p9.2"></span>; note also [1 John
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#014.md),

<span id="ii.iv.vi-p11"></span> \[The idea is, the *minister of
discipline*, as St. Ambrose is represented with a scourge in his hand.
The Greek (<span class="Greek"><span id="ii.iv.vi-p11.1"></span>ἐκ τῶν

here symbolized,—just stewards and righteous men.\]

<span id="fn_296"></span>[37:297](0020028.htm#fr_296.md) <span

<span id="ii.iv.vi-p12"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iv.vi-p12.1"></span>βιωτικαί</span>. The Vatican and Pal. render
this, “the various punishments and tortures which men suffer daily in
their lives.” Pseudo-Athanasius has: “For when they revolt from God,
thinking to be in rest and in wealth, then they are punished, some
meeting with losses,” etc. \[[1 Tim. i.
20](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#020.md)<span id="ii.iv.vi-p12.2"></span>.
Remedial discipline is thus spoken of, [1 Cor. v.

<span id="fn_297"></span>[37:298](0020028.htm#fr_297.md) <span
id="ii.iv.vi-p12.4"></span>

<span id="ii.iv.vi-p13"></span> Pseudo-Athanasius has: “And they cannot
bear for the rest of their days to turn and serve the Lord with a pure
heart. But if they repent and become sober again, then they understand
that they were not prosperous on account of their evil deeds; and so
they glorify the Lord, because He is a just Judge, and because they
suffered justly, and were punished (<span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iv.vi-p13.1"></span>ἐπαιδεύθησαν</span>) according to their
deeds.”

<span id="fn_298"></span>[37:299](0020028.htm#fr_298.md) <span
id="ii.iv.vi-p13.2"></span>

<span id="ii.iv.vi-p14"></span> The Vatican inserts the following
sentence before this: “And when they begin to repent of their sins, then
the works in which they have wickedly exercised themselves arise in
their hearts; and then they give honour to God, saying that He is a just
Judge, and that they have deservedly suffered everything according to
their deeds.” So does Pal. The Æthiopic becomes very condensed in this
portion. \[Note this class of offenders, having suffered remedial
chastisement, are not delivered over the Satan finally, but “delivered
unto me (the angel of repentance) for good training.”\]

<span id="ii.iv.vi-p18"></span> Pseudo-Athanasius has “nothing” (<span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iv.vi-p18.1"></span>οὐδέν</span>) instead of
