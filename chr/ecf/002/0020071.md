##### <span id="iii.ii.xxxv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXV.—Tatian Speaks as an Eye-Witness.

<span id="iii.ii.xxxv-p1"></span>The things which I have thus set before
you I have not learned at second hand. I have visited many lands; I have
followed rhetoric, like yourselves; I have fallen in with many arts and
inventions; and finally, when sojourning in the city of the Romans, I
inspected the multiplicity of statues brought thither by you: for I do
not attempt, as is the custom with many, to strengthen <span
id="page_80">p. 80</span> <span id="iii.ii.xxxv-Page_80"></span>my own
views by the opinions of others, but I wish to give you a distinct
account of what I myself have seen and felt. So, bidding farewell to the
arrogance of Romans and the idle talk of Athenians, and all their
ill-connected opinions, I embraced our barbaric philosophy. I began to
show how this was more ancient than your institutions, <span
id="fr_508"></span>[509](#fn_508) but left my task unfinished, in order
to discuss a matter which demanded more immediate attention; but now it
is time I should attempt to speak concerning its doctrines. Be not
offended with our teaching, nor undertake an elaborate reply filled with
trifling and ribaldry, saying, “Tatian, aspiring to be above the Greeks,
above the infinite number of philosophic inquirers, has struck out a new
path, and embraced the doctrines of Barbarians.” For what grievance is
it, that men manifestly ignorant should be reasoned with by a man of
like nature with themselves? Or how can it be irrational, according to
your own sophist, <span id="fr_509"></span>[510](#fn_509) to grow old
always learning something?
