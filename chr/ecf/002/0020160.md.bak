##### <span id="iv.ii.iii.xxiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXIII.—Prophets More Ancient Than Greek Writers.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.xxiii-p1"></span>So then let what has been said
suffice for the testimony of the Phœnicians and Egyptians, and for the
account of our chronology given by the writers Manetho the Egyptian, and
Menander the Ephesian, and also Josephus, who wrote the Jewish war,
which they waged with the Romans. For from these very old records it is
proved that the writings of the rest are more recent than the writings
given to us through Moses, yes, and than the subsequent prophets. For
the last of the prophets, who was called Zechariah, was contemporary
with the reign of Darius. But even the lawgivers themselves are all
found to have legislated subsequently to that period. For if one were to
mention Solon the Athenian, he lived in the days of the kings Cyrus and
Darius, in the time of the prophet Zechariah first mentioned, who was by
many years the last of the prophets. <span
id="fr_684"></span>[685](#fn_684.md) Or if you mention the lawgivers
Lycurgus, or Draco, or Minos, Josephus tells us in his writings that the
sacred books take precedence of them in antiquity, since even before the
reign of Jupiter over the Cretans, and before the Trojan war, the
writings of the divine law which has been given to us through Moses were
in existence. And that we may give a more accurate exhibition of eras
and dates, we will, God helping us, now give an account not only of the
dates after the deluge, but also of those before it, so as to reckon the
whole number of all the years, as far as possible; tracing up to the
very beginning of the creation of the world, which Moses the servant of
God recorded through the Holy Spirit. For having first spoken of what
concerned the creation and genesis of the world, and of the first man,
and all that happened after in the order of events, he signified also
the years that elapsed before the deluge. And I pray for favour from the
only God, that I may accurately speak the whole truth according to His
will, that you and every one who reads this work may be guided by His
truth and favour. I will then begin first with the recorded genealogies,
and I begin my narration with the first man. <span

the original. Malachi was much later than Zechariah.
