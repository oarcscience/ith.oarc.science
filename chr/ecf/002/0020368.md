##### <span id="vi.iv.iv.xvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.—On Love, and the Repressing of Our Desires.

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xvii-p1"></span>“The decorous tendency of our
philanthropy, therefore,” according to Clement, “seeks the common good;”
whether by suffering martyrdom, or by teaching by deed and word,—the
latter being twofold, unwritten and written. This is love, to love God
and our neighbour. “This conducts to the height which is
unutterable. <span id="fr_2847"></span>[2848](#fn_2847) ‘Love covers a
multitude of sins. <span id="fr_2848"></span>[2849](#fn_2848) Love
beareth all things, suffereth all things.’ <span
id="fr_2849"></span>[2850](#fn_2849) Love joins us to God, does all
things in concord. In love, all the chosen of God were perfected. Apart
from love, nothing is well pleasing to God.” “Of its perfection there is
no unfolding,” it is said. “Who is fit to be found in it, except those
whom God counts worthy?” To the point the Apostle Paul speaks, “If I
give my body, and have not love, I am sounding brass, and a tinkling
cymbal.” <span id="fr_2850"></span>[2851](#fn_2850) If it is not from a
disposition determined by gnostic love that I shall testify, he means;
<span id="page_430">p. 430</span> <span
id="vi.iv.iv.xvii-Page_430"></span>but if through fear and expected
reward, moving my lips in order to testify to the Lord that I shall
confess the Lord, I am a common man, sounding the Lord’s name, not
knowing Him. “For there is the people that loveth with the lips; and
there is another which gives the body to be burned.” “And if I give all
my goods in alms,” he says, not according to the principle of loving
communication, but on account of recompense, either from him who has
received the benefit, or the Lord who has promised; “and if I have all
faith so as to remove mountains,” and cast away obscuring passions, and
be not faithful to the Lord from love, “I am nothing,” as in comparison
of him who testifies as a Gnostic, and the crowd, and being reckoned
nothing better.

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xvii-p6"></span>“Now all the generations from Adam to
this day are gone. But they who have been perfected in love, through the
grace of God, hold the place of the godly, who shall be manifested at
the visitation of the kingdom of Christ.” Love permits not to sin; but
if it fall into any such case, by reason of the interference of the
adversary, in imitation of David, it will sing: “I will confess unto the
Lord, and it will please Him above a young bullock that has horns and
hoofs. Let the poor see it, and be glad.” For he says, “Sacrifice to God
a sacrifice of praise, and pay to the Lord thy vows; and call upon me in
the day of trouble, and I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify
me.” <span id="fr_2851"></span>[2852](#fn_2851) “For the sacrifice of
God is a broken spirit.” <span id="fr_2852"></span>[2853](#fn_2852)

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xvii-p9"></span>“God,” then, being good, “is love,”
it is said. <span id="fr_2853"></span>[2854](#fn_2853) Whose “love
worketh no ill to his neighbour,” <span
id="fr_2854"></span>[2855](#fn_2854) neither injuring nor revenging
ever, but, in a word, doing good to all according to the image of God.
“Love is,” then, “the fulfilling of the law;” <span
id="fr_2855"></span>[2856](#fn_2855) like as Christ, that is the
presence of the Lord who loves us; and our loving teaching of, and
discipline according to Christ. By love, then, the commands not to
commit adultery, and not to covet one’s neighbour’s wife, are fulfilled,
\[these sins being\] formerly prohibited by fear.

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xvii-p13"></span>The same work, then, presents a
difference, according as it is done by fear, or accomplished by love,
and is wrought by faith or by knowledge. Rightly, therefore, their
rewards are different. To the Gnostic “are prepared what eye hath not
seen, nor ear heard, nor hath entered into the heart of man;” but to him
who has exercised simple faith He testifies a hundredfold in return for
what he has left,—a promise which has turned out to fall within human
comprehension.

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xvii-p14"></span>Come to this point, I recollect one
who called himself a Gnostic. For, expounding the words, “But I say unto
you, he that looketh on a woman to lust after, hath committed
adultery,” <span id="fr_2856"></span>[2857](#fn_2856) he thought that it
was not bare desire that was condemned; but if through the desire the
act that results from it proceeding beyond the desire is accomplished in
it. For dream employs phantasy and the body. Accordingly, the historians
relate the following decision of Bocchoris the just. <span
id="fr_2857"></span>[2858](#fn_2857) A youth, falling in love with a
courtezan, persuades the girl, for a stipulated reward, to come to him
next day. But his desire being unexpectedly satiated, by laying hold of
the girl in a dream, by anticipation, when the object of his love came
according to stipulation, he prohibited her from coming in. But she, on
learning what had taken place, demanded the reward, saying that in this
way she had sated the lover’s desire. They came accordingly to the
judge. He, ordering the youth to hold out the purse containing the
reward in the sun, bade the courtezan take hold of the shadow;
facetiously bidding him pay the image of a reward for the image of an
embrace.

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xvii-p17"></span>Accordingly one dreams, the soul
assenting to the vision. But he dreams waking, who looks so as to lust;
not only, as that Gnostic said, if along with the sight of the woman he
imagine in his mind intercourse, for this is already the act of lust, as
lust; but if one looks on beauty of person (the Word says), and the
flesh seem to him in the way of lust to be fair, looking on carnally and
sinfully, he is judged because he admired. For, on the other hand, he
who in chaste love looks on beauty, thinks not that the flesh is
beautiful, but the spirit, admiring, as I judge, the body as an image,
by whose beauty he transports himself to the Artist, and to the true
beauty; exhibiting the sacred symbol, the bright impress of
righteousness to the angels that wait on the ascension; <span
id="fr_2858"></span>[2859](#fn_2858) I mean the unction of acceptance,
the quality of disposition which resides in the soul that is gladdened
by the communication of the Holy Spirit. This glory, which shone forth
on the face of Moses, the people could not look on. Wherefore he took a
veil for the glory, to those who looked carnally. For those, who demand
toll, detain those who bring in any worldly things, who are burdened
with their own passions. But him that is free of all things which are
subject to duty, and is full of knowledge, and of the righteousness of
works, they pass on with their good wishes, blessing the man with his
work. “And his life shall not fall away”—the leaf of the living tree
that is nourished “by the water-courses.” <span
id="fr_2859"></span>[2860](#fn_2859) Now <span id="page_431">p.
431</span> <span id="vi.iv.iv.xvii-Page_431"></span>the righteous is
likened to fruit-bearing trees, and not only to such as are of the
nature <span id="fr_2860"></span>[2861](#fn_2860) of tall-growing ones.
And in the sacrificial oblations, according to the law, there were those
who looked for blemishes in the sacrifices. They who are skilled in such
matters distinguish propension <span
id="fr_2861"></span>[2862](#fn_2861) (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.iv.xvii-p21.3"></span>ὄρεξις</span>) from lust (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.iv.iv.xvii-p21.4"></span>ἐπιθυμία</span>);
and assign the latter, as being irrational, to pleasures and
licentiousness; and propension, as being a rational movement, they
assign to the necessities of nature.
