##### <span id="iv.ii.ii.xxi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXI.—Of the Fall of Man.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xxi-p1"></span>“Now the serpent was more subtle than
any beast of the field which the <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.ii.ii.xxi-p1.1"></span>Lord</span> God had made. And the serpent
said to the woman, Why hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of
the garden? And the woman said unto the serpent, We eat of every tree of
the garden, but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the
garden God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it,
lest ye die. And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely
die. For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes
shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil. And the
woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to
the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise; and having taken of
the fruit thereof, she did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her:
and they did eat. And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew
that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made
themselves aprons. And they heard the voice of the <span
class="sc"><span id="iv.ii.ii.xxi-p1.2"></span>Lord</span> God walking
<span id="page_103">p. 103</span> <span
id="iv.ii.ii.xxi-Page_103"></span>in the garden in the cool of the day,
and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the <span
class="sc"><span id="iv.ii.ii.xxi-p1.3"></span>Lord</span> God amongst
the trees of the garden. And the <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.ii.ii.xxi-p1.4"></span>Lord</span> God called unto Adam, and said
unto him, Where art thou? And he said unto Him, I heard Thy voice in the
garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked, and I hid myself. And He
said unto him, Who told thee that thou wast naked, unless thou hast
eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?
And Adam said, The woman whom Thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of
the tree, and I did eat. And God said to the woman, What is this that
thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did
eat. And the <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.ii.ii.xxi-p1.5"></span>Lord</span> God said unto the serpent,
Because thou hast done this, thou art accursed above all the beasts of
the earth; on thy breast and belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou
eat all the days of thy life: and I will put enmity between thee and the
woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and
thou shalt bruise his heel. <span id="fr_590"></span>[591](#fn_590.md) And
to the woman He said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy
travail: in sorrow shalt thou bring forth children; and thy desire shall
be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee. And unto Adam He said,
Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten
of the tree of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it;
cursed is the ground in <span id="fr_591"></span>[592](#fn_591.md) thy
works: in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life; thorns
and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb
of the field. In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat thy bread, till
thou return unto the earth; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou
art, and unto dust shalt thou return.” <span
id="fr_592"></span>[593](#fn_592.md) Such is the account given by holy
Scripture of the history of man and of Paradise.
