##### <span id="v.ii.ix-p0.1"></span>Chapter IX.—The Testimony of the Prophets.

<span id="v.ii.ix-p1"></span>If we satisfied ourselves with advancing
such considerations as these, our doctrines might by some be looked upon
as human. But, since the voices of the prophets confirm our
arguments—for I think that you also, with your great zeal for knowledge,
and your great attainments in learning, cannot be ignorant of the
writings either of Moses or of Isaiah and Jeremiah, and the other
prophets, who, lifted in ecstasy above the natural operations of their
minds by the impulses of the Divine Spirit, uttered the things with
which they were inspired, the Spirit making use of them as a
flute-player <span id="fr_721"></span>[722](#fn_721) breathes into a
flute;—what, then, do these men say? “The <span class="sc"><span
id="v.ii.ix-p2.1"></span>Lord</span> is our God; no other can be
compared with Him.” <span id="fr_722"></span>[723](#fn_722) And again:
“I am God, the first and the last, and besides Me there is no
God.” <span id="fr_723"></span>[724](#fn_723) In like manner: “Before Me
there was no other God, and after Me there shall be none; I am God, and
there is none besides Me.” <span id="fr_724"></span>[725](#fn_724) And
as to His greatness: “Heaven is My throne, and the earth is the
footstool of My feet: what house will ye build for Me, or what is the
place of My rest?” <span id="fr_725"></span>[726](#fn_725) But I leave
it to you, when you meet with the books themselves, to examine carefully
the prophecies contained in them, that you may on fitting grounds defend
us from the abuse cast upon us.
