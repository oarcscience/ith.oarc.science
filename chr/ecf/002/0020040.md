##### <span id="iii.ii.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.—The Christians Worship God Alone.

<span id="iii.ii.iv-p1"></span>For what reason, men of Greece, do you
wish to bring the civil powers, as in a pugilistic encounter, into
collision with us? And, if I am not disposed to comply with the usages
of some of them, why am I to be abhorred as a vile miscreant? <span
id="fr_425"></span>[426](#fn_425.md) Does the sovereign order the payment
of tribute, I am ready to render it. Does my master command me to act as
a bondsman and to serve, I acknowledge the serfdom. Man is to be
honoured as a fellow-man; <span id="fr_426"></span>[427](#fn_426.md) God
alone is to be feared,—He who is not visible to human eyes, nor comes
within the compass of human art. Only when I am commanded to deny Him,
will I not obey, but will rather die than show myself false and
ungrateful. Our God did not begin to be in time: <span
id="fr_427"></span>[428](#fn_427.md) He alone is without beginning, and He
Himself is the beginning of all things. God is a Spirit, <span
id="fr_428"></span>[429](#fn_428.md) not pervading matter, but the Maker of
material spirits, <span id="fr_429"></span>[430](#fn_429.md) and of the
forms that are in matter; He is invisible, impalpable, being Himself the
Father of both sensible and invisible things. Him we know from His
creation, and apprehend His invisible power by His works. <span
id="fr_430"></span>[431](#fn_430.md) I refuse to adore that workmanship
which He has made for our sakes. The sun and moon were made for us: how,
then, can I adore my own servants? How can I speak of stocks and stones
as gods? For the Spirit that pervades matter <span
id="fr_431"></span>[432](#fn_431.md) is inferior to the more divine spirit;
and this, even when assimilated to the soul, is not to be honoured
equally with the perfect God. Nor even ought the ineffable God to be
presented with gifts; for He who is in want of nothing is not to be
misrepresented by us as though He were indigent. But I will set forth
our views more distinctly.

<span id="iii.ii.iv-p2"></span> \[Dear Christians of those times; so
Justin and all the rest appeal against this odium. Their name an
offence, “cast out as evil,” but fragrant with unrequited love. [Matt.

This claim for man *as man* is the inspiration of Christianity. Terence
breathes it from his wounded soul in slavery; and his immortal line,
“Homo sum: humani nihil a me alienum puto” (*Hæuntontimor.*, act. i. sc.
1, verse 25), looks as if it had been written in the second century of
illumination.\]
