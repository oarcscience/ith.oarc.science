##### <span id="iv.ii.i.xii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XII.—Meaning of the Name Christian.

<span id="iv.ii.i.xii-p1"></span>And about your laughing at me and
calling me “Christian,” you know not what you are saying. First, because
that which is anointed <span id="fr_540"></span>[541](#fn_540) is sweet
and serviceable, and far from contemptible. For what ship can be
serviceable and seaworthy, unless it be first caulked \[anointed\]? Or
what castle or house is beautiful and serviceable when it has not been
anointed? And what man, when he enters into this life or into the
gymnasium, is not anointed with oil? And what work has either ornament
or beauty unless it be anointed and burnished? Then the air and all that
is under heaven is in a certain sort anointed by light and spirit; and
are you unwilling to be anointed with the oil of God? Wherefore we are
called Christians on this account, because we are anointed with the oil
of God. <span id="fr_541"></span>[542](#fn_541)

<span id="iv.ii.i.xii-p2"></span> “The argumentation of this chapter
depends on the literal meaning which Theophilus attaches to *Christos*,
the Anointed One; and he plays on this meaning, and also on the
similarity of pronunciation between <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.ii.i.xii-p2.1"></span>χρηστός</span>, ‘useful,’ and <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.ii.i.xii-p2.2"></span>χριστός</span> ,
‘anointed.’”—<span class="sc"><span

<span id="iv.ii.i.xii-p3"></span> \[Not material oil probably, for it is
not mentioned in such Scriptures as [Acts viii.
17](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#017)<span id="iv.ii.i.xii-p3.1"></span>,
xix. 6, [Heb. vi. 2](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#002)<span
id="iv.ii.i.xii-p3.2"></span>; but the anointing ([1 John ii.
20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#020)<span id="iv.ii.i.xii-p3.3"></span>)
of the Holy Ghost. As a symbol, oil was used at an early period,
however; and the Latins are not slow to press this in favour of material
oil in the *chrism*, or confirmation.\]
