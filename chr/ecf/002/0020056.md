##### <span id="iii.ii.xx-p0.1"></span>Chapter XX.—Thanks are Ever Due to God.

<span id="iii.ii.xx-p1"></span>Even if you be healed by drugs (I grant
you that point by courtesy), yet it behoves you to give testimony of the
cure to God. For the world still draws us down, and through weakness I
incline towards matter. For the wings of the <span id="page_74">p.
74</span> <span id="iii.ii.xx-Page_74"></span>soul were the perfect
spirit, but, having cast this off through sin, it flutters like a
nestling and falls to the ground. Having left the heavenly
companionship, it hankers after communion with inferior things. The
demons were driven forth to another abode; the first created human
beings were expelled from their place: the one, indeed, were cast down
from heaven; but the other were driven from earth, yet not out of this
earth, but from a more excellent order of things than exists here now.
And now it behoves us, yearning after that pristine state, to put aside
everything that proves a hindrance. The heavens are not infinite, O man,
but finite and bounded; and beyond them are the superior worlds which
have not a change of seasons, by which various diseases are produced,
but, partaking of every happy temperature, have perpetual day, and light
unapproachable by men below. <span id="fr_480"></span>[481](#fn_480.md)
Those who have composed elaborate descriptions of the earth have given
an account of its various regions so far as this was possible to man;
but, being unable to speak of that which is beyond, because of the
impossibility of personal observation, they have assigned as the cause
the existence of tides; and that one sea is filled with weed, and
another with mud; and that some localities are burnt up with heat, and
others cold and frozen. We, however, have learned things which were
unknown to us, through the teaching of the prophets, who, being fully
persuaded that the heavenly spirit <span
id="fr_481"></span>[482](#fn_481.md) along with the soul will acquire a
clothing of mortality, foretold things which other minds were
unacquainted with. But it is possible for every one who is naked to
obtain this apparel, and to return to its ancient kindred.

<span id="iii.ii.xx-p2"></span> \[The flavour of this passage comes out
with more sweetness in Kaye’s note (p. 198, *Justin M*.), thus: “Above
the visible heavens exist the better ages, <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.ii.xx-p2.1"></span>αἰῶνες οἰ κρείττονες</span>, having no change
of seasons from which various diseases take their orgin; but, blest with
a uniform goodness of temperature, they enjoy perpetual day, and light
inaccessible to men who dwell here below.”

<span id="iii.ii.xx-p3"></span>Here Tatian seems to me to have had in
mind a noble passage from Pindar, one of the most exquisite specimens of
Greek poetry, which he baptizes and sanctifies.

> <span id="iii.ii.xx-p3.1"></span> Ἴσον δὲ νύκτεσσιν αἰεὶ;  
> Ἴσα δ᾽ἐν ἁμέραις ἄλι-  
> <span class="Greek"><span id="iii.ii.xx-p3.5"></span>ον ἔχοντες,
> ἀπονέστερον</span>  
> Ἐσθλοὶ νέμονται βίο-  
> <span class="Greek"><span id="iii.ii.xx-p3.8"></span>τον οὐ χθόνα
> ταράσσον-</span>  
> <span class="Greek"><span id="iii.ii.xx-p3.10"></span>τες ἀλκᾷ χερῶν,
> </span>  
> Οὐδὲ πόντιον ὕδωρ,  
> Κεινὰν παρὰ δίαιταν · κ.τ.λ. *Olymp*. ii.  

<span id="iii.ii.xx-p4"></span>Truly the Gentiles reflect some light
from the window in the ark of their father Noah. How sweet what follows:
<span class="Greek"><span id="iii.ii.xx-p4.1"></span>ἄδακρυν νέμονται
αἰῶνα</span>. Comp. [Rev. vii. 7](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#007.md)<span
id="iii.ii.xx-p4.2"></span>, xxi. 4, xxii.\]

<span id="fn_481"></span>[74:482](0020056.htm#fr_481.md) <span
id="iii.ii.xx-p4.3"></span>

<span id="iii.ii.xx-p5"></span> \[Kaye thus renders this passage: “the
spirit together with the soul will receive immortality, the heavenly
covering of mortality.” Justin, p. 288.\]
