##### <span id="iv.ii.ii.xxviii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXVIII.—Why Eve Was Formed of Adam’s Rib.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xxviii-p1"></span>And Adam having been cast out of
Paradise, in this condition knew Eve his wife, whom God had formed into
a wife for him out of his rib. And this He did, not as if He were unable
to make his wife separately, but God foreknew that man would call upon a
number of gods. And having this prescience, and knowing that through the
serpent error would introduce a number of gods which had no
existence,—for there being but one God, even then error was striving to
disseminate a multitude of gods, saying, “Ye shall be as gods;”—lest,
then, it should be supposed that one God made the man and another the
woman, therefore He made them both; and God made the woman together with
the man, not only that thus the mystery of God’s sole government might
be exhibited, but also that their mutual affection might be greater.
Therefore said Adam to Eve, “This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of
my flesh.” And besides, he prophesied, saying, “For this cause shall a
man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife; and
they two shall be one flesh;” <span id="fr_604"></span>[605](#fn_604.md)
which also itself has its fulfilment in ourselves. For who that marries
lawfully does not despise mother and father, and his whole family
connection, and all his household, cleaving to and becoming one with his
own wife, fondly preferring her? So that often, for the sake of their
wives, some submit even to death. This Eve, on account of her having
been in the beginning deceived by the serpent, and become the author of
sin, the wicked demon, who also is called Satan, who then spoke to her
through the serpent, and who works even to this day in those men that
are possessed by him, invokes as Eve. <span
id="fr_605"></span>[606](#fn_605.md) And he is called “demon” and “dragon,”
on account of his \[<span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.ii.ii.xxviii-p3.1"></span>ἀποδεδρακέναι</span>\] revolting from
God. For at first he was an angel. And concerning his history there is a
great deal to be said; wherefore I at present omit the relation of it,
for I have also given an account of him in another place.

believe was an unintentional invocation of Eve, the authoress of all
sin.
