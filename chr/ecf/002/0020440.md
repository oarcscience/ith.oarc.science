### <span id="vi.iv.viii.x-p0.1"></span>Elucidations.

##### <span id="vi.iv.viii.x-p0.2"></span>I.

<span id="vi.iv.viii.x-p1"></span>(Scripture, cap. i. p. 558.)

<span id="vi.iv.viii.x-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="vi.iv.viii.x-p2.1"></span>On</span> the 18th of July, 1870, Pius the
Ninth, by the bull *Pastor Æternus* proclaiming himself *infallible,*
and defining that every Roman bishop from the times of the apostles were
equally so, placed himself in conflict, not merely with Holy Scripture
(which repeatedly proves the fallibility of St. Peter himself, when
speaking apart from his fellow-apostles), but with the torrent of all
antiquity. Yes, and with the great divines of his own communion, such as
Bossuet; including divers pontiffs, and the Gallicans generally. But
note, here, what St. Clement says of the Holy Scripture, and of the
search after truth. Is it conceivable, that he knew of any living
infallible oracle, when he wrote this book, never once hinting the
existence of any such source <span id="page_568">p. 568</span> <span
id="vi.iv.viii.x-Page_568"></span>of absolute gnostic perfection? A like
ignorance of such an oracle characterizes Vincent of Lerins, the great
expounder of the rule of faith as understood by the four great councils
of antiquity.

<span id="vi.iv.viii.x-p3"></span>Clearly, Clement had never seen in
Irenæus the meaning read into his words by the modern flatterers of the
Roman See. <span id="fr_3710"></span>[3711](#fn_3710.md) The discovery of
1870 comes just eighteen centuries too late for practical purposes.

##### <span id="vi.iv.viii.x-p4.1"></span>II.

<span id="vi.iv.viii.x-p5"></span>(Of Book the Eighth, note 1, p. 567.)

<span id="vi.iv.viii.x-p6"></span>In the place of this book, according
to some <span class="sc"><span
id="vi.iv.viii.x-p6.1"></span>mss.</span>, Photius found the tract <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.iv.viii.x-p6.2"></span>τίς ὁ σωζόμενος
πλούσιος</span>; in other <span class="sc"><span
id="vi.iv.viii.x-p6.3"></span>mss</span>., a book beginning as this
does. He accused the *Stromata* of unsound opinions; but, this censure
not being supported by anything we possess, some imagine that the eighth
book is lost, and that it is no great loss after all. A rash judgment as
to its value; but possibly this, which is *called* the eighth book, is
from the lost *Hypotyposes*. Kaye’s suggestion is, that, as the seventh
book closed with a promise of something quite fresh, we may discover it
in this contribution towards forming his Gnostic, to further knowledge.

<span id="vi.iv.viii.x-p7"></span>It should be regarded as of great
importance, that Christianity appears as the friend of all knowledge,
and of human culture, from the very start. To our author’s versatile
genius, much credit is due for the elements out of which Christian
universities took their rise.
