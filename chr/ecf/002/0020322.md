##### <span id="vi.iv.i.xxix-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXIX.—The Greeks But Children Compared with the Hebrews.

<span id="vi.iv.i.xxix-p1"></span>Whence most beautifully the Egyptian
priest in Plato said, “O Solon, Solon, you Greeks are always children,
not having in your souls a single ancient opinion received through
tradition from antiquity. And not one of the Greeks is an old
man;” <span id="fr_2135"></span>[2136](#fn_2135.md) meaning by old, I
suppose, those who know what belongs to the more remote antiquity, that
is, our literature; and by young, those who treat of what is more recent
and made the subject of study by the Greeks,—things of yesterday and of
recent date as if they were old and ancient. Wherefore he added, “and no
study hoary with time;” for we, in a kind of barbarous way, deal in
homely and rugged metaphor. Those, therefore, whose minds are rightly
constituted approach the interpretation utterly destitute of artifice.
And of the Greeks, he says that their opinions” differ but little from
myths.” For neither puerile fables nor stories current among children
are fit for listening to. And he called the myths themselves “children,”
as if the progeny of those, wise in their own conceits among the Greeks,
who had but little insight; meaning by the “hoary studies” the truth
which was possessed by the barbarians, dating from the highest
antiquity. To which expression he opposed the phrase “child fable,”
censuring the mythical character of the attempts of the moderns, as,
like children, having nothing of age in them, and affirming both in
common—their fables and their speeches—to be puerile.

<span id="vi.iv.i.xxix-p3"></span>Divinely, therefore, the power which
spoke to Hermas by revelation said, “The visions and revelations are for
those who are of double mind, who doubt in their hearts if these things
are or are not.” <span id="fr_2136"></span>[2137](#fn_2136.md)

<span id="vi.iv.i.xxix-p5"></span>Similarly, also, demonstrations from
the resources of erudition, strengthen, confirm, and establish
demonstrative reasonings, in so far as men’s minds are in a wavering
state like young people’s. “The good commandment,” then, according to
the Scripture, “is a lamp, and the law is a light to the path; for
instruction corrects the ways of life.” <span
id="fr_2137"></span>[2138](#fn_2137.md) “Law is monarch of all, both of
mortals and of immortals,” says Pindar. I understand, however, by these
words, Him who enacted law. And I regard, as spoken of the God of all,
the following utterance of Hesiod, though spoken by the poet at random
and not with comprehension:—

> <span id="vi.iv.i.xxix-p6.2"></span> “For the Saturnian framed for men
> this law:  
> Fishes, and beasts, and winged birds may eat  
> Each other, since no rule of right is theirs;  
> But Right (by far the best) to men he gave.”  

<span id="vi.iv.i.xxix-p7"></span>Whether, then, it be the law which is
connate and natural, or that given afterwards, which is meant, it is
certainly of God; and both the law of nature and that of instruction are
one. Thus also Plato, in *The Statesman,* says that the lawgiver is one;
and in *The Laws*, that he who shall understand music is one; teaching
by these words that the Word is one, and God is one. And Moses
manifestly calls the Lord a covenant: “Behold I am my Covenant with
thee,” <span id="fr_2138"></span>[2139](#fn_2138.md) having previously told
him not to seek the covenant in writing. <span
id="fr_2139"></span>[2140](#fn_2139.md) For it is a covenant which God, the
Author of all, makes. For God is called <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.i.xxix-p9.1"></span>Θεός</span>, from <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.iv.i.xxix-p9.2"></span>θέσις</span>
(placing), and order or arrangement. And in the *Preaching* <span
id="fr_2140"></span>[2141](#fn_2140.md) of Peter you will find the Lord
called Law and Word. But at this point, let our first Miscellany <span
id="fr_2141"></span>[2142](#fn_2141.md) of gnostic notes, according to the
true philosophy, come to a close.

<span id="vi.iv.i.xxix-p9"></span> The allusion here is obscure. The
suggestion has been made that it is to ver. 2 of the same chapter, which
is thus taken to intimate that the covenant would be verbal, not
written.

called. \[This book is not cited as Scripture, but (*valeat quantum*) as
containing a saying attributed to St. Peter. Clement quotes it not
infrequently. A very full and valuable account of it may be found in
Lardner, vol. ii. p. 252, *et seqq*. Not less valuable is the account
given by Jones, *On the Canon*, vol. i. p. 355. See all Clement’s
