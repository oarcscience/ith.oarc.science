##### <span id="iv.ii.i.ii-p0.1"></span>Chapter II.—That the Eyes of the Soul Must Be Purged Ere God Can Be Seen.

<span id="iv.ii.i.ii-p1"></span>But if you say, “Show me thy God,” I
would reply, “Show me yourself, <span id="fr_526"></span>[527](#fn_526.md)
and I will show you my God.” Show, then, that the eyes of your soul are
capable of seeing, and the ears of your heart able to hear; for as those
who look with the eyes of the body perceive earthly objects and what
concerns this life, and discriminate at the same time between things
that differ, whether light or darkness, white or black, deformed or
beautiful, well-proportioned and symmetrical or disproportioned and
awkward, or monstrous or mutilated; and as in like manner also, by the
sense of hearing, we discriminate either sharp, or deep, or sweet
sounds; so the same holds good regarding the eyes of the soul and the
ears of the heart, that it is by them we are able to behold God. For God
is seen by those who are enabled to see Him when they have the eyes of
their soul opened: for all have eyes; but in some they are
overspread, <span id="fr_527"></span>[528](#fn_527.md) and do not see the
light of the sun. Yet it does not follow, because the blind do not see,
that the light of the sun does not shine; but let the blind blame
themselves and their own eyes. So also thou, O man, hast the eyes of thy
soul overspread by thy sins and evil deeds. As a burnished mirror, so
ought man to have his soul pure. When there is rust on the mirror, it is
not possible that a man’s face be seen in the mirror; so also when there
is sin in a man, such a man cannot behold God. Do you, therefore, show
me yourself, whether you are not an adulterer, or a fornicator, or a
thief, or a robber, or a purloiner; whether you do not corrupt boys;
whether you are not insolent, or a slanderer, or passionate, or envious,
or proud, or supercilious; whether you are not a brawler, or covetous,
or disobedient to parents; and whether you do not sell your children;
for to those who do these things God is not manifest, unless they have
first cleansed themselves from all impurity. All these things, then,
involve you in darkness, as when a filmy defluxion on the eyes prevents
one from beholding the light of the sun: thus also do iniquities, man,
involve you in darkness, so that you cannot see God.
