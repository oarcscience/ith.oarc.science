##### <span id="v.ii.xxix-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXIX.—Proof of the Same from the Poets.

<span id="v.ii.xxix-p1"></span>But among the Greeks, also, those who are
eminent in poetry and history say the same thing. Thus of Heracles:—

> <span id="v.ii.xxix-p1.1"></span> “That lawless wretch, that man of
> brutal strength,  
> Deaf to Heaven’s voice, the social rite transgressed.” <span
> id="fr_808"></span>[809](#fn_808)  

<span id="v.ii.xxix-p3"></span>Such being his nature, deservedly did he
go mad, and deservedly did he light the funeral pile and burn himself to
death. Of Asklepius, Hesiod says:—

> <span id="v.ii.xxix-p3.1"></span> “The mighty father both of gods and
> men  
> Was filled with wrath, and from Olympus’ top  
> With flaming thunderbolt cast down and slew  
> Latona’s well-lov’d son—such was his ire.” <span
> id="fr_809"></span>[810](#fn_809)  

<span id="v.ii.xxix-p5"></span>And Pindar:—

> <span id="v.ii.xxix-p5.1"></span> “But even wisdom is ensnared by
> gain.  
> The brilliant bribe of gold seen in the hand  
> Ev’n him <span id="fr_810"></span>[811](#fn_810) perverted: therefore
> Kronos’ son  
> With both hands quickly stopp’d his vital breath,  
> And by a bolt of fire ensured his doom.” <span
> id="fr_811"></span>[812](#fn_811)  

<span id="v.ii.xxix-p8"></span>Either, therefore, they were gods and did
not hanker after gold—

> <span id="v.ii.xxix-p8.1"></span> “O gold, the fairest prize to mortal
> men,  
> Which neither mother equals in delight,  
> Nor children dear” <span id="fr_812"></span>[813](#fn_812) —  

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span> <span id="v.ii.xxix-Page_145"></span>

<span id="v.ii.xxix-p10"></span>for the Deity is in want of nought, and
is superior to carnal desire, nor did they die; or, having been born
men, they were wicked by reason of ignorance, and overcome by love of
money. What more need I say, or refer to Castor, or Pollux, or
Amphiaraus, who, having been born, so to speak, only the other day, men
of men, are looked upon as gods, when they imagine even Ino after her
madness and its consequent sufferings to have become a goddess?

> <span id="v.ii.xxix-p10.1"></span> “Sea-rovers will her name
> Leucothea.” <span id="fr_813"></span>[814](#fn_813)  

<span id="v.ii.xxix-p12"></span>And her son:—

> <span id="v.ii.xxix-p12.1"></span> “August Palæmon, sailors will
> invoke.”
