##### <span id="vi.iv.ii.ii-p0.1"></span>Chapter II.—The Knowledge of God Can Be Attained Only Through Faith.

<span id="vi.iv.ii.ii-p1"></span>“Be not elated on account of thy
wisdom,” say the Proverbs. “In all thy ways acknowledge her, that she
may direct thy ways, and that thy foot may not stumble.” By these
remarks he means to show that our deeds ought to be conformable to
reason, and to manifest further that we ought to select and possess what
is useful out of all culture. Now the ways of wisdom are various that
lead right to the way of truth. Faith is the way. “Thy foot shall not
stumble” is said with reference to some who seem to oppose the one
divine administration of Providence. Whence it is added, “Be not wise in
thine own eyes,” according to the impious ideas which revolt against the
administration of God. “But fear God,” who alone is powerful. Whence it
follows as a consequence that we are not to oppose God. The sequel
especially teaches clearly, that “the fear of God is departure from
evil;” for it is said, “and depart from all evil.” Such is the
discipline of wisdom (“for whom the Lord loveth He chastens” <span
id="fr_2160"></span>[2161](#fn_2160) .md), causing pain in order to produce
understanding, and restoring to peace and immortality. Accordingly, the
Barbarian philosophy, which we follow, is in reality perfect and true.
And so it is said in the book of Wisdom: “For He hath given me the
unerring knowledge of things that exist, to know the constitution of the
word,” and so forth, down to “and the virtues of roots.” Among all these
he comprehends natural science, which treats of all the phenomena in the
world of sense. And in continuation, he alludes also to intellectual
objects in what he subjoins: “And what is hidden or manifest I know; for
Wisdom, the artificer of all things, taught me.” <span
id="fr_2161"></span>[2162](#fn_2161.md) You have, in brief, the professed
aim of our philosophy; and the learning of these branches, when pursued
with right course of conduct, leads through Wisdom, the artificer of all
things, to the Ruler of all,—a Being difficult to grasp and apprehend,
ever receding and withdrawing from him who pursues. But He who is far
off has—oh ineffable marvel!—come very near. “I am a God that draws
near,” says the Lord. He is in essence remote; “for how is it that what
is begotten can have approached the Unbegotten?” But He is very near in
virtue of that power which holds all things in its embrace. “Shall one
do aught in secret, and I see him not?” <span
id="fr_2162"></span>[2163](#fn_2162.md) For the power of God is always
present, in contact with us, in the exercise of inspection, of
beneficence, of instruction. Whence Moses, persuaded that God is not to
be known by human wisdom, said, “Show me Thy glory;” <span
id="fr_2163"></span>[2164](#fn_2163.md) and into the thick darkness where
God’s voice was, pressed to enter—that is, into the inaccessible and
invisible ideas respecting Existence. For God is not in darkness or in
place, but above both space and time, and qualities of objects.
Wherefore neither is He at any time in a part, either as containing or
as contained, either by limitation or by section. “For what house will
ye build to Me?” saith the Lord. <span
id="fr_2164"></span>[2165](#fn_2164.md) Nay, He has not even built one for
Himself, since He cannot be contained. And though heaven be called His
throne, not even thus is He contained, but He rests delighted in the
creation.

<span id="vi.iv.ii.ii-p7"></span>It is clear, then, that the truth has
been hidden from us; and if that has been already shown by one example,
we shall establish it a little after by several more. How entirely
worthy of approbation are they who are both willing to learn, and able,
according to Solomon, “to know wisdom and instruction, and to perceive
the words of wisdom, to receive knotty words, and to perceive true
righteousness,” there being another \[righteousness as well\], not
according to the truth, taught by the Greek laws, and by the rest of the
philosophers. “And to direct judgments,” it is said—not those of the
bench, but he means that we must preserve sound and free of error the
judicial faculty which is within us—“That I may give subtlety to the
simple, to the young man sense and understanding.” <span
id="fr_2165"></span>[2166](#fn_2165.md) “For the wise man,” who has been
persuaded to obey the commandments, “having heard these things, will
become wiser” by knowledge; and “the intelligent man will acquire rule,
and will understand a parable and a dark word, the sayings and enigmas
of the wise.” <span id="fr_2166"></span>[2167](#fn_2166.md) For it is not
spurious words which those inspired by God and those who are gained over
by them adduce, nor is it snares in which the most of the sophists
entangle the young, spending their time on nought true. But those who
possess the Holy Spirit “search the deep things of God,” <span
id="fr_2167"></span>[2168](#fn_2167.md) —that is, grasp the secret that is
in the prophecies. “To impart of holy things to the dogs” is forbidden,
so long as they remain beasts. For never ought those who are envious and
perturbed, and still infidel in conduct, shameless in barking at
investigation, <span id="page_349">p. 349</span> <span
id="vi.iv.ii.ii-Page_349"></span>to dip in the divine and clear stream
of the living water. “Let not the waters of thy fountain overflow, and
let thy waters spread over thine own streets.” <span
id="fr_2168"></span>[2169](#fn_2168.md) For it is not many who understand
such things as they fall in with; or know them even after learning them,
though they think they do, according to the worthy Heraclitus. Does not
even he seem to thee to censure those who believe not? “Now my just one
shall live by faith,” <span id="fr_2169"></span>[2170](#fn_2169.md) the
prophet said. And another prophet also says, “Except ye believe, neither
shall ye understand.” <span id="fr_2170"></span>[2171](#fn_2170.md) For how
ever could the soul admit the transcendental contemplation of such
themes, while unbelief respecting what was to be learned struggled
within? But faith, which the Greeks disparage, deeming it futile and
barbarous, is a voluntary preconception, <span
id="fr_2171"></span>[2172](#fn_2171.md) the assent of piety—“the subject of
things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen,” according to the
divine apostle. “For hereby,” pre-eminently, “the elders obtained a good
report. But without faith it is impossible to please God.” <span
id="fr_2172"></span>[2173](#fn_2172.md) Others have defined faith to be a
uniting assent to an unseen object, as certainly the proof of an unknown
thing is an evident assent. If then it be choice, being desirous of
something, the desire is in this instance intellectual. And since choice
is the beginning of action, faith is discovered to be the beginning of
action, being the foundation of rational choice in the case of any one
who exhibits to himself the previous demonstration through faith.
Voluntarily to follow what is useful, is the first principle of
understanding. Unswerving choice, then, gives considerable momentum in
the direction of knowledge. The exercise of faith directly becomes
knowledge, reposing on a sure foundation. Knowledge, accordingly, is
defined by the sons of the philosophers as a habit, which cannot be
overthrown by reason. Is there any other true condition such as this,
except piety, of which alone the Word is teacher? <span
id="fr_2173"></span>[2174](#fn_2173.md) I think not. Theophrastus says that
sensation is the root of faith. For from it the rudimentary principles
extend to the reason that is in us, and the understanding. He who
believeth then the divine Scriptures with sure judgment, receives in the
voice of God, who bestowed the Scripture, a demonstration that cannot be
impugned. Faith, then, is not established by demonstration. “Blessed
therefore those who, not having seen, yet have believed.” <span
id="fr_2174"></span>[2175](#fn_2174.md) The Siren’s songs, exhibiting a
power above human, fascinated those that came near, conciliating them,
almost against their will, to the reception of what was said.
