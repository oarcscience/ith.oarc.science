##### <span id="v.ii.xi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XI.—The Moral Teaching of the Christians Repels the Charge Brought Against Them.

<span id="v.ii.xi-p1"></span>If I go minutely into the particulars of
our doctrine, let it not surprise you. It is that you may not be carried
away by the popular and irrational opinion, but may have the truth
clearly before you. For presenting the opinions themselves to which we
adhere, as being not human but uttered and taught by God, we shall be
able to persuade you not to think of us as atheists. What, then, are
those teachings in which we are brought up? “I say unto you, Love your
enemies; bless them that curse you; pray for them that persecute you;
that ye may be the sons of your Father who is in heaven, who causes His
sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the just and the
unjust.” <span id="fr_731"></span>[732](#fn_731) Allow me here to lift
up my voice boldly in loud and audible outcry, pleading as I do before
philosophic princes. For who of those that reduce syllogisms, and clear
up ambiguities, and explain etymologies, <span
id="fr_732"></span>[733](#fn_732) or of those who teach homonyms and
synonyms, and predicaments and axioms, and what is the subject and what
the predicate, and who promise their disciples by these and such like
instructions to make them happy: who of them have so purged their souls
as, instead of hating their enemies, to love them; and, instead of
speaking ill of those who have reviled them (to abstain from which is of
itself an evidence of no mean forbearance), to bless them; and to pray
for those who plot against their lives? On the contrary, they never
cease with evil intent to search out skilfully the secrets of their
art, <span id="fr_733"></span>[734](#fn_733) and are ever bent on
working some ill, making the art of words and not the exhibition of
deeds their business and profession. But among us you will find
uneducated persons, and artisans, and old women, who, if they are unable
in words to prove the benefit of our doctrine, yet by their deeds
exhibit the benefit arising from their persuasion of its truth: they do
not rehearse speeches, but exhibit good works; when struck, they do not
strike again; when robbed, they do not go to law; they give to those
that ask of them, and love their neighbours as themselves.

probably reference is to the practices of the Sophists.
