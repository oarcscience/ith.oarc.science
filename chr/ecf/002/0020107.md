##### <span id="iv.ii.ii.ix-p0.1"></span>Chapter IX.—The Prophets Inspired by the Holy Ghost.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.ix-p1"></span>But men of God carrying in them a holy
spirit <span id="fr_564"></span>[565](#fn_564.md) and becoming prophets,
being inspired and made wise by God, became God-taught, and holy, and
righteous. Wherefore they were also deemed worthy of receiving this
reward, that they should become instruments of God, and contain the
wisdom that is from Him, through which wisdom they uttered both what
regarded the creation of the world and all other things. For they
predicted also pestilences, and famines, and wars. And there was not one
or two, but many, at various times and seasons among the Hebrews; and
also among the Greeks there was the Sibyl; and they all have spoken
things consistent and harmonious with each other, both what happened
before them and what happened in their own time, and what things are now
being fulfilled in our own day: wherefore we are persuaded also
concerning the future things that they will fall out, as also the first
have been accomplished.
