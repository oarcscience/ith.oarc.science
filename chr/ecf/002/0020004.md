#### <span id="ii.ii.i-p0.1"></span>Vision First.

##### <span id="ii.ii.i-p0.2"></span>Against Filthy and Proud Thoughts, and the Carelessness of Hermas in Chastising His Sons.

##### <span id="ii.ii.i-p0.3"></span>Chap. I.

<span id="ii.ii.i-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.ii.i-p1.1"></span>He</span> who had brought me up, sold me to one
Rhode in Rome. <span id="fr_20"></span>[21](#fn_20.md) Many years after
this I recognised her, and I began to love her as a sister. Some time
after, I saw her bathe in the river Tiber; and I gave her my hand, and
drew her out of the river. The sight of her beauty made me think with
myself, “I should be a happy man if I could but get a wife as handsome
and good as she is.” This was the only thought that passed through me:
this and nothing more. A short time after this, as I was walking on my
road to the villages, <span id="fr_21"></span>[22](#fn_21.md) and
magnifying the creatures of God, and thinking how magnificent, and
beautiful, and powerful they are, <span id="fr_22"></span>[23](#fn_22.md) I
fell asleep. And the Spirit carried me away, and took me through a
pathless place, <span id="fr_23"></span>[24](#fn_23.md) through which a man
could not travel, for it was situated in the midst of rocks; it was
rugged and impassible on account of water. Having passed over this
river, I came to a plain. I then bent down on my knees, and began to
pray to the Lord, <span id="fr_24"></span>[25](#fn_24.md) and to confess my
sins. And as I prayed, the heavens were opened, and I see the woman whom
I had desired saluting me from the sky, and saying, “Hail, Hermas!” And
looking up to her, I said, “Lady, what doest thou here?” And she
answered me, “I have been taken up here to accuse you of your sins
before the Lord.” “Lady,” said I, “are you to be the subject of my
accusation?” <span id="fr_25"></span>[26](#fn_25.md) “No,” said she; “but
hear the words which I am going to speak to you. God, who dwells in the
heavens, and made out of nothing the things that exist, and multiplied
and increased them on account of His holy Church, <span
id="fr_26"></span>[27](#fn_26.md) is angry with you for having sinned
against me.” I answered her, “Lady, have I sinned against you?
How? <span id="fr_27"></span>[28](#fn_27.md) or when spoke I an unseemly
word to you? Did I not always think of you as a lady? Did I not always
respect you as a sister? Why do you falsely accuse me of this wickedness
and impurity?” With a smile she replied to me, “The desire of
wickedness <span id="fr_28"></span>[29](#fn_28.md) arose within your heart.
Is it not your opinion that a righteous man commits sin when an evil
desire arises in his heart? There is sin in such a case, and the sin is
great,” said she; “for the thoughts of a righteous man should be
righteous. For by thinking righteously his character is established in
the heavens, <span id="fr_29"></span>[30](#fn_29.md) and he has the Lord
merciful to him in every business. But such as entertain wicked thoughts
in their minds are bringing upon themselves death and captivity; and
especially is this the case with those who set their affections on this
world, <span id="fr_30"></span>[31](#fn_30.md) and glory in their riches,
and look not forward to the blessings of the life to come. For many will
their regrets be; for they have no hope, but have despaired of
themselves and their life. <span id="fr_31"></span>[32](#fn_31.md) But do
thou pray to God, and He will <span id="page_10">p. 10</span> <span
id="ii.ii.i-Page_10"></span>heal thy sins, and the sins of thy whole
house, and of all the saints.” <span id="fr_32"></span>[33](#fn_32.md)

##### <span id="ii.ii.i-p14.2"></span>Chap. II.

<span id="ii.ii.i-p15"></span>After she had spoken these words, the
heavens were shut. I was overwhelmed with sorrow and fear, and said to
myself, “If this sin is assigned to me, how can I be saved, or how shall
I propitiate God in regard to my sins, <span
id="fr_33"></span>[34](#fn_33.md) which are of the grossest character? With
what words shall I ask the Lord to be merciful to me?” While I was
thinking over these things, and discussing them in my mind, I saw
opposite to me a chair, white, made of white wool, <span
id="fr_34"></span>[35](#fn_34.md) of great size. And there came up an old
woman, arrayed in a splendid robe, and with a book in her hand; and she
sat down alone, and saluted me, “Hail, Hermas!” And in sadness and
tears <span id="fr_35"></span>[36](#fn_35.md) I said to her, “Lady, hail!”
And she said to me, “Why are you downcast, Hermas? for you were wont to
be patient and temperate, and always smiling. Why are you so gloomy, and
not cheerful?” I answered her and said, “O Lady, I have been reproached
by a very good woman, who says that I sinned against her.” And she said,
“Far be such a deed from a servant of God. But perhaps a desire after
her has arisen within your heart. Such a wish, in the case of the
servants of God, produces sin. For it is a wicked and horrible wish in
an all-chaste and already well-tried spirit <span
id="fr_36"></span>[37](#fn_36.md) to desire an evil deed; and especially
for Hermas so to do, who keeps himself from all wicked desire, and is
full of all simplicity, and of great guilelessness.”

##### <span id="ii.ii.i-p19.1"></span>Chap. III.

<span id="ii.ii.i-p20"></span>“But God is not angry with you on account
of this, but that you may convert your house, <span
id="fr_37"></span>[38](#fn_37.md) which have committed iniquity against the
Lord, and against you, their parents. And although you love your sons,
yet did you not warn your house, but permitted them to be terribly
corrupted. <span id="fr_38"></span>[39](#fn_38.md) On this account is the
Lord angry with you, but He will heal all the evils which have been done
in your house. For, on account of their sins and iniquities, you have
been destroyed by the affairs of this world. But now the mercy of the
Lord <span id="fr_39"></span>[40](#fn_39.md) has taken pity on you and your
house, and will strengthen you, and establish you in his glory. <span
id="fr_40"></span>[41](#fn_40.md) Only be not easy-minded, <span
id="fr_41"></span>[42](#fn_41.md) but be of good courage and comfort your
house. For as a smith hammers out his work, and accomplishes whatever he
wishes <span id="fr_42"></span>[43](#fn_42.md) , so shall righteous daily
speech overcome all iniquity. <span id="fr_43"></span>[44](#fn_43.md) Cease
not therefore to admonish your sons; for I know that, if they will
repent with all their heart, they will be enrolled in the Books of Life
with the saints.” <span id="fr_44"></span>[45](#fn_44.md) Having ended
these words, she said to me, “Do you wish to hear me read?” I say to
her, “Lady, I do.” “Listen then, and give ear to the glories of
God.” <span id="fr_45"></span>[46](#fn_45.md) And then I heard from her,
magnificently and admirably, things which my memory could not retain.
For all the words were terrible, such as man could not endure. <span
id="fr_46"></span>[47](#fn_46.md) The last words, however, I did remember;
for they were useful to us, and gentle. <span
id="fr_47"></span>[48](#fn_47.md) “Lo, the God of powers, who by His
invisible strong power and great wisdom has created the world, and by
His glorious counsel has surrounded His creation with beauty, and by His
strong word has fixed the heavens and laid the foundations of the earth
upon the waters, and by His own wisdom and providence <span
id="fr_48"></span>[49](#fn_48.md) has created His holy <span
id="fr_49"></span>[50](#fn_49.md) Church, which He has blessed, lo! He
removes <span id="fr_50"></span>[51](#fn_50.md) the heavens and the
mountains, <span id="fr_51"></span>[52](#fn_51.md) the hills and the seas,
and all things become plain to His elect, that He may bestow on them the
blessing which He has promised them, <span
id="fr_52"></span>[53](#fn_52.md) with much glory and joy, if only they
shall keep the commandments of God which they have received in great
faith.”

##### <span id="ii.ii.i-p36.2"></span>Chap. IV.

<span id="ii.ii.i-p37"></span>When she had ended her reading, she rose
from the chair, and four young men came and carried off the chair and
went away to the east. And she called me to herself and touched my
breast, and said to me, “Have you been pleased with my reading?” And I
say to her, “Lady, <span id="page_11">p. 11</span> <span
id="ii.ii.i-Page_11"></span>the last words please me, but the first are
cruel and harsh.” Then she said to me, “The last are for the righteous:
the first are for heathens and apostates.” And while she spoke to me,
two men appeared and raised her on their shoulders, and they went to
where the chair was in the east. With joyful countenance did she depart;
and as she went, she said to me, “Behave like a man, <span
id="fr_53"></span>[54](#fn_53.md) Hermas.”

<span id="ii.ii.i-p2"></span> The commencement varies. In the Vatican:
“He who had brought me up, sold a certain young woman at Rome. Many
years after this I saw her and recognized her.” So Lips.; Pal. has the
name of the woman, Rada. The name Rhode occurs in [Acts xii.
13](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#013.md)<span id="ii.ii.i-p2.1"></span>.

<span id="ii.ii.i-p3"></span> “On my road to the villages.” This seems
to mean: as I was taking a walk into the country, or spending my time in
travelling amid rural scenes. So the Æthiopic version. “Proceeding with
these thoughts in my mind.”—*Vat*. After I had come to the city of
Ostia.”—*Pal*. “Proceeding to some village.”—*Lips*. \[The Christian
religion begetting this enthusiasm for nature, and love for nature’s
God, is to be noted. Where in all heathendom do we find spirit or
expression like this?\]
