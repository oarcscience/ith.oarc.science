#### <span id="ii.iii.ii-p0.1"></span>Commandment Second.

##### <span id="ii.iii.ii-p0.2"></span>On Avoiding Evil-Speaking, and on Giving Alms in Simplicity.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p1"></span>He said to me, “Be simple and guileless,
and you will be as the children who know not the wickedness that ruins
the life of men. First, then, speak evil of no one, nor listen with
pleasure to any one who speaks evil of another. But if you listen, you
will partake of the sin of him who speaks evil, if you believe the
slander which you hear; <span id="fr_153"></span>[154](#fn_153) for
believing it, you will also have something to say against your brother.
Thus, then, will you be guilty of the sin of him who slanders. For
slander is evil <span id="fr_154"></span>[155](#fn_154) and an unsteady
demon. It never abides in peace, but always remains in discord. Keep
yourself from it, and you will always be at peace with all. Put on a
holiness in which there is no wicked cause of offence, but all deeds
that are equable and joyful. Practise goodness; and from the rewards of
your labours, which God gives you, give to all the needy in simplicity,
not hesitating as to whom you are to give or not to give. Give to all,
for God wishes His gifts to be shared amongst all. They who receive,
will render an account to God why and for what they have received. For
the afflicted who receive will not be condemned, <span
id="fr_155"></span>[156](#fn_155) but they who receive on false
pretences will suffer punishment. He, then, who gives is guiltless. For
as he received from the Lord, so has he accomplished his service in
simplicity, not hesitating as to whom he should give and to whom he
should not give. This service, then, if accomplished in simplicity, is
glorious with God. He, therefore, who thus ministers in simplicity, will
live to God. <span id="fr_156"></span>[157](#fn_156) Keep therefore
these commandments, as I have given them to you, that your repentance
and the repentance of your house may be found in simplicity, and your
heart <span id="fr_157"></span>[158](#fn_157) may be pure and
stainless.”

And if you believe the slanderer, you will also be guilty of sin, in
that you have belived one who speaks evil of your brother.—*Vat*. For if
you give your assent to the detractor, and believe what is said of one

towards your brother, and you are guilty of the same sin as the person
who slanders.—*Pal*.
