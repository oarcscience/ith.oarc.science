##### <span id="vi.iv.iv.ix-p0.1"></span>Chapter X.—Those Who Offered Themselves for Martyrdom Reproved.

<span id="vi.iv.iv.ix-p1"></span>When, again, He says, “When they
persecute you in this city, flee ye to the other,” <span
id="fr_2791"></span>[2792](#fn_2791.md) He does not advise flight, as if
persecution were an evil thing; nor does He enjoin them by flight to
avoid death, as if in dread of it, but wishes us neither to be the
authors nor abettors of any evil to any one, either to ourselves or the
persecutor and murderer. For He, in a way, bids us take care of
ourselves. But he who disobeys is rash and foolhardy. If he who kills a
man of God sins against God, he also who presents himself before the
judgment-seat becomes guilty of his death. And such is also the case
with him who does not avoid persecution, but out of daring presents
himself for capture. Such a one, as far as in him lies, becomes an
accomplice in the crime of the persecutor. And if he also uses
provocation, he is wholly guilty, challenging the wild beast. And
similarly, if he afford any cause for conflict or punishment, or
retribution or enmity, he gives occasion for persecution. Wherefore,
then, we are enjoined not to cling to anything that belongs to this
life; but “to him that takes our cloak to give our coat,” not only that
we may continue destitute of inordinate affection, but that we may not
by retaliating make our persecutors savage against ourselves, and stir
them up to blaspheme the name. <span
