##### <span id="iv.ii.iii.xxx-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXX.—Why the Greeks Did Not Mention Our Histories.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.xxx-p1"></span>But the Greeks make no mention of the
histories which give the truth: first, because they themselves only
recently became partakers of the knowledge of letters; and they
themselves own it, alleging that letters were invented, some say among
the Chaldæans, and others with the Egyptians, and others again say that
they are derived from the Phœnicians. And secondly, because they sinned,
and still sin, in not making mention of God, but of vain and useless
matters. For thus they most heartily celebrate Homer and Hesiod, and the
rest of the poets, but the glory of the incorruptible and only God they
not only omit to mention, but blaspheme; yes, and they persecuted, and
do daily persecute, those who worship Him. And not only so, but they
even bestow prizes and honours on those who in harmonious language
insult God; but of those who are zealous in the pursuit of virtue and
practice a holy life, some they stoned, some they put to death, and up
to the present time they subject them to savage tortures. Wherefore such
men have necessarily lost the wisdom of God, and have not found the
truth.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.xxx-p2"></span>If you please, then, study these
things carefully, that you may have a compendium <span
id="fr_692"></span>[693](#fn_692) and pledge of the truth.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.xxx-p3"></span> Otto prefers <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.ii.iii.xxx-p3.1"></span>σύμβουλον</span>
instead of <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.ii.iii.xxx-p3.2"></span>σύμβολον</span> , on the authority of one
<span class="sc"><span id="iv.ii.iii.xxx-p3.3"></span>ms.</span> The
sense then is, “that you may have a counsellor and pledge of the
truth,”—the counsellor and pledge of the truth being the book written by
Theophilus for Autolycus. \[This has been supposed to mean, “that you
may have a token and pledge (or earnest) of the truth,” i.e., in
Christian baptism. Our author uses St. Paul’s word (<span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.ii.iii.xxx-p3.4"></span>ἀῤῥαβὼν</span>), “the
earnest of the spirit,” as in [2 Cor. i.
22](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#022)<span
id="iv.ii.iii.xxx-p3.5"></span>, and [Eph.
1](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#000)<span
