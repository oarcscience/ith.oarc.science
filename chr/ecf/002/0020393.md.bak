<span id="vi.iv.vi.iii"></span>

##### <span id="vi.iv.vi.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.—Plagiarism by the Greeks of the Miracles Related in the Sacred Books of the Hebrews.

<span id="vi.iv.vi.iii-p1"></span>And now they are convicted not only of
borrowing doctrines from the Barbarians, but also of relating as
prodigies of Hellenic mythology the marvels found in our records,
wrought through divine power from above, by those who led holy lives,
while devoting attention to us. And we shall ask at them whether those
things which they relate are true or false. But they will not say that
they are false; for they will not with their will condemn themselves of
the very great silliness of composing falsehoods, but of necessity admit
them to be true. And how will the prodigies enacted by Moses and the
other prophets any longer appear to them incredible? For the Almighty
God, in His care for all men, turns some to salvation by commands, some
by threats, some by miraculous signs, some by gentle promises.

<span id="vi.iv.vi.iii-p2"></span>Well, the Greeks, when once a drought
had wasted Greece for a protracted period, and a dearth of the fruits of
the earth ensued, it is said, those that survived of them, having,
because of the famine, come as suppliants to Delphi, asked the Pythian
priestess how they should be released from the calamity. She announced
that the only help in their distress was, that they should avail
themselves of the prayers of Æacus. Prevailed on by them, Æacus,
ascending the Hellenic hill, and stretching out pure <span
id="fr_3236"></span>[3237](#fn_3236.md) hands to heaven, and invoking the
common <span id="fr_3237"></span>[3238](#fn_3237.md) God, besought him to
pity wasted Greece. And as he prayed, thunder sounded, out of the usual
course of things, and the whole surrounding atmosphere was covered with
clouds. And impetuous and continued rains, bursting down, filled the
whole region. The result was a copious and rich fertility wrought by the
husbandry of the prayers of Æacus.

<span id="vi.iv.vi.iii-p5"></span>“And Samuel called on the <span
class="sc"><span id="vi.iv.vi.iii-p5.1"></span>Lord</span>,” it is said,
“and the <span class="sc"><span
id="vi.iv.vi.iii-p5.2"></span>Lord</span> gave forth His voice, and rain
in the day of harvest.” <span id="fr_3238"></span>[3239](#fn_3238.md) Do
you see that “He who sendeth His rain on the just and on the <span
id="page_487">p. 487</span> <span
id="vi.iv.vi.iii-Page_487"></span>unjust” <span
id="fr_3239"></span>[3240](#fn_3239.md) by the subject powers is the one
God? And the whole of our Scripture is full of instances of God, in
reference to the prayers of the just, hearing and performing each one of
their petitions.

<span id="vi.iv.vi.iii-p8"></span>Again, the Greeks relate, that in the
case of a failure once of the Etesian winds, Aristæus once sacrificed in
Ceus to Isthmian Zeus. For there was great devastation, everything being
burnt up with the heat in consequence of the winds which had been wont
to refresh the productions of the earth, not blowing, and he easily
called them back.

<span id="vi.iv.vi.iii-p9"></span>And at Delphi, on the expedition of
Xerxes against Greece, the Pythian priestess having made answer:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.iii-p9.1"></span> “O Delphians, pray the winds, and
> it will be better,”—  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.iii-p10"></span>they having erected an altar and
performed sacrifice to the winds, had them as their helpers. For,
blowing violently around Cape Sepias, they shivered the whole
preparations of the Persian expedition. Empedocles of Agrigentum was
called “Checker of Winds.” Accordingly it is said, that when, on a time,
a wind blew from the mountain of Agrigentum, heavy and pestiferous for
the inhabitants, and the cause also of barrenness to their wives, he
made the wind to cease. Wherefore he himself writes in the lines:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.iii-p10.1"></span> “Thou shalt the might of the
> unwearied winds make still,  
> Which rushing to the earth spoil mortals’ crops,  
> And at thy will bring back the avenging blasts.”  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.iii-p11"></span>And they say that he was followed by
some that used divinations, and some that had been long vexed by sore
diseases. <span id="fr_3240"></span>[3241](#fn_3240.md) They plainly, then,
believed in the performance of cures, and signs and wonders, from our
Scriptures. For if certain powers move the winds and dispense showers,
let them hear the psalmist: “How amiable are thy tabernacles, O <span
class="sc"><span id="vi.iv.vi.iii-p12.3"></span>Lord</span> of
hosts!” <span id="fr_3241"></span>[3242](#fn_3241.md) This is the Lord of
powers, and principalities, and authorities, of whom Moses speaks; so
that we may be with Him. “And ye shall circumcise your hard heart, and
shall not harden your neck any more. For He is Lord of lords and God of
gods, the great God and strong,” <span
id="fr_3242"></span>[3243](#fn_3242.md) unit so forth. And Isaiah says,
“Lift your eyes to the height, and see who hath produced all these
things.” <span id="fr_3243"></span>[3244](#fn_3243.md)

<span id="vi.iv.vi.iii-p16"></span>And some say that plagues, and
hail-storms, and tempests, and the like, are wont to take place, not
alone in consequence of material disturbance, but also through anger of
demons and bad angels. For instance, they say that the Magi at Cleone,
watching the phenomena of the skies, when the clouds are about to
discharge hail, avert the threatening of wrath by incantations and
sacrifices. And if at any time there is the want of an animal, they are
satisfied with bleeding their own finger for a sacrifice. The prophetess
Diotima, by the Athenians offering sacrifice previous to the pestilence,
effected a delay of the plague for ten years. The sacrifices, too, of
Epimenides of Crete, put off the Persian war for an equal period. And it
is considered to be all the same whether we call these spirits gods or
angels. And those skilled in the matter of consecrating statues, in many
of the temples have erected tombs of the dead, calling the souls of
these Dæmons, and teaching them to be worshipped by men; as having, in
consequence of the purity of their life, by the divine foreknowledge,
received the power of wandering about the space around the earth in
order to minister to men. For they knew that some souls were by nature
kept in the body. But of these, as the work proceeds, in the treatise on
the angels, we shall discourse.

<span id="vi.iv.vi.iii-p17"></span>Democritus, who predicted many things
from observation of celestial phenomena, was called “Wisdom” (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.iv.vi.iii-p17.1"></span>Σοφία</span>). On his
meeting a cordial reception from his brother Damasus, he predicted that
there would be much rain, judging from certain stars. Some, accordingly,
convinced by him, gathered their crops; for being in summer-time, they
were still on the threshing-floor. But others lost all, unexpected and
heavy showers having burst down.

<span id="vi.iv.vi.iii-p18"></span>How then shall the Greeks any longer
disbelieve the divine appearance on Mount Sinai, when the fire burned,
consuming none of the things that grew on the mount; and the sound of
trumpets issued forth, breathed without instruments? For that which is
called the descent on the mount of God is the advent of divine power,
pervading the whole world, and proclaiming “the light that is
inaccessible.” <span id="fr_3244"></span>[3245](#fn_3244.md)

<span id="vi.iv.vi.iii-p20"></span>For such is the allegory, according
to the Scripture. But the fire was seen, as Aristobulus <span
id="fr_3245"></span>[3246](#fn_3245.md) says, while the whole multitude,
amounting to not less than a million, besides those under age, were
congregated around the mountain, the circuit of the mount not being less
than five days’ journey. Over the whole place of the vision the burning
fire was seen by them all encamped as it were around; so that the
descent was not local. For God is everywhere.

<span id="vi.iv.vi.iii-p22"></span>Now the compilers of narratives say
that in the island of Britain <span id="fr_3246"></span>[3247](#fn_3246.md)
there is a cave situated under a mountain, and a chasm on its summit;
<span id="page_488">p. 488</span> <span
id="vi.iv.vi.iii-Page_488"></span>and that, accordingly, when the wind
falls into the cave, and rushes into the bosom of the cleft, a sound is
heard like cymbals clashing musically. And often in the woods, when the
leaves are moved by a sudden gust of wind, a sound is emitted like the
song of birds.

<span id="vi.iv.vi.iii-p24"></span>Those also who composed the *Persics*
relate that in the uplands, in the country of the Magi, three mountains
are situated on an extended plain, and that those who travel through the
locality, on coming to the first mountain, hear a confused sound as of
several myriads shouting, as if in battle array; and on reaching the
middle one, they hear a clamour louder and more distinct; and at the end
hear people singing a pæan, as if victorious. And the cause, in my
opinion, of the whole sound, is the smoothness and cavernous character
of the localities; and the air, entering in, being sent back and going
to the same point, sounds with considerable force. Let these things be
so. But it is possible for God Almighty, <span
id="fr_3247"></span>[3248](#fn_3247.md) even without a medium, to produce a
voice and vision through the ear, showing that His greatness has a
natural order beyond what is customary, in order to the conversion of
the hitherto unbelieving soul, and the reception of the commandment
given. But there being a cloud and a lofty mountain, how is it not
possible to hear a different sound, the wind moving by the active cause?
Wherefore also the prophet says, “Ye heard the voice of words, and saw
no similitude.” <span id="fr_3248"></span>[3249](#fn_3248.md) You see how
the Lord’s voice, the Word, without shape, the power of the Word, the
luminous word of the Lord, the truth from heaven, from above, coming to
the assembly of the Church, wrought by the luminous immediate ministry.
