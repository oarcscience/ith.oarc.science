##### <span id="iv.ii.iii.xv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XV.—The Innocence of the Christians Defended.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.xv-p1"></span>Consider, therefore, whether those who
teach such things can possibly live indifferently, and be commingled in
unlawful intercourse, or, most impious of all, eat human flesh,
especially when we are forbidden so much as to witness shows of
gladiators, lest we become partakers and abettors of murders. But
neither may we see the other spectacles, <span
id="fr_669"></span>[670](#fn_669) lest our eyes and ears be defiled,
participating in the utterances there sung. For if one should speak of
cannibalism, in these spectacles the children of Thyestes and Tereus are
eaten; and as for adultery, both in the case of men and of gods, whom
they celebrate in elegant language for honours and prizes, this is made
the subject of their dramas. But far be it from Christians to conceive
any such deeds; for with them temperance dwells, self-restraint is
practiced, monogamy is observed, chastity is guarded, iniquity
exterminated, sin extirpated, righteousness exercised, law administered,
worship performed, God acknowledged: truth governs, grace guards, peace
screens them; the holy word guides, wisdom teaches, life directs, God
reigns. Therefore, though we have much to say regarding our manner of
life, and the ordinances of God, the maker of all creation, we yet
consider that we have for the present reminded you of enough to induce
you to study these things, especially since you can now read \[our
writings\] for yourself, that as you have been fond of acquiring
information, you may still be studious in this direction also.

Christians of our age be reminded of this warning; frequenting, as they
do, plays and operas equally defiling, impure in purport often, even
when not gross in language.\]
