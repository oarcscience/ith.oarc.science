##### <span id="iv.ii.ii.viii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VIII.— Opinions Concerning Providence.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.viii-p1"></span>And why should I recount further the
vast array of such names and genealogies? So that all the authors and
poets, and those called philosophers, are wholly deceived; and so, too,
are they who give heed to them. For they plentifully composed fables and
foolish stories about their gods, and did not exhibit them as gods, but
as men, and men, too, of whom some were drunken, and others fornicators
and murderers. But also concerning the origin of the world, they uttered
contradictory and absurd opinions. First, some of them, as we before
explained, maintained that the world is uncreated. And those that said
it was uncreated and self-producing contradicted those who propounded
that it was created. For by conjecture and human conception they spoke,
and not knowing the truth. And others, again, said that there was a
providence, and destroyed the positions of the former writers. Aratus,
indeed, says: <span id="fr_559"></span>[560](#fn_559) —

> <span id="iv.ii.ii.viii-p2.1"></span> “From Jove begin my song; nor
> ever be  
> The name unuttered: all are full of thee;  
> The ways and haunts of men; the heavens and sea:  
> On thee our being hangs; in thee we move;  
> All are thy offspring and the seed of Jove.  
> Benevolent, he warns mankind to good,  
> Urges to toil and prompts the hope of food.  
> He tells where cattle best may graze, and where  
> The soil, deep-furrowed, yellow grain will bear.  
> What time the husbandman should plant or sow,  
> ’Tis his to tell, ’tis his alone to know.”  

<span id="iv.ii.ii.viii-p3"></span>Who, then, shall we believe: Aratus
as here quoted, or Sophocles, when he says: <span
id="fr_560"></span>[561](#fn_560) —

> <span id="iv.ii.ii.viii-p4.1"></span> “And foresight of the future
> there is none;  
> ’Tis best to live at random, as one can”?  

<span id="iv.ii.ii.viii-p5"></span>And Homer, again, does not agree with
this, for he says <span id="fr_561"></span>[562](#fn_561) that virtue

> <span id="iv.ii.ii.viii-p6.1"></span> “Waxes or wanes in men as Jove
> decrees.”  

<span id="iv.ii.ii.viii-p7"></span>And Simonides says:—

> <span id="iv.ii.ii.viii-p7.1"></span> “No man nor state has virtue
> save from God;  
> Counsel resides in God; and wretched man  
> Has in himself nought but his wretchedness.”  

<span id="iv.ii.ii.viii-p8"></span>So, too, Euripides:—

> <span id="iv.ii.ii.viii-p8.1"></span> “Apart from God, there’s nothing
> owned by men.”  

<span id="iv.ii.ii.viii-p9"></span>And Menander:—

> <span id="iv.ii.ii.viii-p9.1"></span> “Save God alone, there’s none
> for us provides.”  

<span id="iv.ii.ii.viii-p10"></span>And Euripides again:—

> <span id="iv.ii.ii.viii-p10.1"></span> “For when God wills to save,
> all things He’ll bend  
> To serve as instruments to work His end.”  

<span id="iv.ii.ii.viii-p11"></span>And Thestius:—

> <span id="iv.ii.ii.viii-p11.1"></span> “If God design to save you,
> safe you are,  
> Though sailing in mid-ocean on a mat.” <span
> id="fr_562"></span>[563](#fn_562)  

<span id="iv.ii.ii.viii-p13"></span>And saying numberless things of a
like kind, they contradicted themselves. At least Sophocles, who in
another place denied Providence, says:—

> <span id="iv.ii.ii.viii-p13.1"></span> “No mortal can evade the stroke
> of God.”  

<span id="iv.ii.ii.viii-p14"></span>Besides, they both introduced a
multitude of gods, and yet spoke of a Unity; and against those who
affirmed a Providence they maintained in opposition that there was no
Providence. Wherefore Euripides says:—

> <span id="iv.ii.ii.viii-p14.1"></span> “We labour much and spend our
> strength in vain,  
> For empty hope, not foresight, is our guide.”  

<span id="iv.ii.ii.viii-p15"></span>And without meaning to do so, they
acknowledge that they know not the truth; but being inspired by demons
and puffed up by them, they spoke at their instance whatever they said.
For indeed the poets,—Homer, to wit, and Hesiod, being, as they say,
inspired by the Muses,—spoke from a deceptive fancy, <span
id="fr_563"></span>[564](#fn_563) and not with a pure but an erring
spirit. And this, indeed, clearly appears from the fact, that even to
this day the possessed are sometimes exorcised in the name of the living
and true God; and these spirits of error themselves confess that they
are demons who also formerly inspired these writers. But sometimes some
of them wakened up in soul, and, that they might be for a witness both
to themselves and to all men, spoke things in harmony with the prophets
regarding the monarchy of God, and the judgment and such like.
