##### <span id="iv.ii.ii.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.—Opinions of Homer and Hesiod Concerning the Gods.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.v-p1"></span>So that the opinion of your philosophers
and authors is discordant; for while the former have propounded the
foregoing opinions, the poet Homer is found explaining the origin not
only of the world, but also of the gods, on quite another hypothesis.
For he says somewhere: <span id="fr_552"></span>[553](#fn_552.md) —

> <span id="iv.ii.ii.v-p2.1"></span> “Father of Gods, Oceanus, and she  
> Who bare the gods, their mother Tethys, too,  
> From whom all rivers spring, and every sea.”  

<span id="iv.ii.ii.v-p3"></span>In saying which, however, he does not
present God to us. For who does not know that the ocean is water? But if
water, then not God. God indeed, if He is the creator of all things, as
He certainly is, is the creator both of the water and of the seas. And
Hesiod himself also declared the origin, not only of the gods, but also
of the world itself. And though he said that the world was created, he
showed no inclination to tell us by whom it was created. Besides, he
said that Saturn, and his sons Jupiter, Neptune, and Pluto, were gods,
though we find that they are later born than the world. And he also
relates how Saturn was assailed in war by his own son Jupiter; for he
says: <span id="fr_553"></span>[554](#fn_553.md) —

> <span id="iv.ii.ii.v-p4.1"></span> “His father Saturn he by might
> o’ercame,  
> And ’mong th’ immortals ruled with justice wise,  
> And honours fit distributed to each.”  

<span id="iv.ii.ii.v-p5"></span>Then he introduces in his poem the
daughters of Jupiter, whom he names Muses, and as whose suppliant he
appears, desiring to ascertain from them how all things were made; for
he says: <span id="fr_554"></span>[555](#fn_554.md) —

> <span id="iv.ii.ii.v-p6.1"></span> “Daughters of Jove, all hail! Grant
> me your aid  
> That I in numbers sweet and well-arrayed,  
> Of the immortal gods may sing the birth;  
> Who of the starry heav’ns were born, and earth;  
> Who, springing from the murky night at first,  
> Were by the briny ocean reared and nursed.  
> Tell, too, who form unto the earth first gave,  
> And rivers, and the boundless sea whose wave  
> Unwearied sinks, then rears its crest on high;  
> And how was spread yon glittering canopy  
> Of glistening stars that stud the wide-spread heaven.  
> Whence sprang the gods by whom all good is given?  
> Tell from their hands what varied gifts there came,  
> Riches to some, to others wealth, or fame;  
> How they have dwelt from the remotest time  
> In many-nooked Olympus’ sunny clime.  
> These things, ye Muses, say, who ever dwell  
> Among Olympian shades—since ye can tell:  
> From the beginning there thy feet have strayed;  
> Then tell us which of all things first was made.”  

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span> <span id="iv.ii.ii.v-Page_96"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.ii.v-p7"></span>But how could the Muses, who are younger
than the world, know these things? Or how could they relate to Hesiod
\[what was happening\], when their father was not yet born?
