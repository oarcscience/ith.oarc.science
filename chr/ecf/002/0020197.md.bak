##### <span id="v.ii.xxvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXVII.—Artifices of the Demons.

<span id="v.ii.xxvii-p1"></span>What then? In the first place, the
irrational and fantastic movements of the soul about opinions produce a
diversity of images (<span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.xxvii-p1.1"></span>εἴδωλα</span>) from time to time: some they
derive from matter, and some they fashion and bring forth for
themselves; and this happens to a soul especially when it partakes of
the material spirit <span id="fr_797"></span>[798](#fn_797.md) and becomes
mingled with it, looking not at heavenly things and their Maker, but
downwards to earthly things, wholly at the earth, as being now mere
flesh and blood, and no longer pure spirit. <span
id="fr_798"></span>[799](#fn_798.md) These irrational and fantastic
movements of the soul, then, give birth to empty visions in the mind, by
which it becomes madly set on idols. When, too, a tender and susceptible
soul, which has no knowledge or experience of sounder doctrines, and is
unaccustomed to contemplate truth, and to consider thoughtfully the
Father and Maker of all things, gets impressed with false opinions
respecting itself, then the demons who hover about matter, greedy of
sacrificial odours and the blood of victims, and ever ready to lead men
into error, avail themselves of these delusive movements of the souls of
the multitude; and, taking possession of their thoughts, cause to flow
into the mind empty visions as if coming from the idols and the statues;
and when, too, a soul of itself, as being immortal, <span
id="fr_799"></span>[800](#fn_799.md) moves comformably to reason, either
predicting the future or healing the present, the demons claim the glory
for themselves.
