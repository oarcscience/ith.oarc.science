##### <span id="iii.ii.xxxvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXVII.—Testimony of the Phœnicians.

<span id="iii.ii.xxxvii-p1"></span>After the Chaldeans, the testimony of
the Phœnicians is as follows. There were among them three men,
Theodotus, Hypsicrates, and Mochus; Chaitus translated their books into
Greek, and also composed with exactness the lives of the philosophers.
Now, in the histories of the aforesaid writers it is shown that the
abduction of Europa happened under one of the kings, and an account is
given of the coming of Menelaus into Phœnicia, and of the matters
relating to Chiramus, <span id="fr_510"></span>[511](#fn_510) who gave
his daughter in marriage to Solomon the king of the Jews, and supplied
wood of all kind of trees for the building of the temple. Menander of
Pergamus composed a history concerning the same things. But the age of
Chiramus is somewhere about the Trojan war; but Solomon, the
contemporary of Chiramus, lived much later than the age of Moses.
