##### <span id="iii.ii.xxiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXIII.—Of the Pugilists and Gladiators.

<span id="iii.ii.xxiii-p1"></span>I have seen men weighed down by bodily
exercise, and carrying about the burden of their flesh, before whom
rewards and chaplets are set, while the adjudicators cheer them on, not
to deeds of virtue, but to rivalry in violence and discord; and he who
excels in giving blows is crowned. These are the lesser evils; as for
the greater, who would not shrink from telling them? Some, giving
themselves up to idleness for the sake of profligacy, sell themselves to
be killed; and the indigent barters himself away, while the rich man
buys others to kill him. And for these the witnesses take their seats,
and the boxers meet in single combat, for no reason whatever, nor does
any one come down into the arena to succour. Do such exhibitions as
these redound to your credit? He who is chief among you collects a
legion of blood-stained murderers, engaging to maintain them; and these
ruffians are sent forth by him, and you assemble at the spectacle to be
judges, partly of the wickedness of the adjudicator, and partly of that
of the men who engage in the combat. And he who misses the murderous
exhibition is grieved, because he was not doomed to be a spectator of
wicked and impious and abominable deeds. You slaughter animals for the
purpose of eating their flesh, and you purchase men to supply a cannibal
banquet for the soul, nourishing it by the most impious bloodshedding.
The robber commits murder for the sake of plunder, but the rich man
purchases gladiators for the sake of their being killed. <span
