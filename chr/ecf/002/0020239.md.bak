##### <span id="vi.ii.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.—The Cruelty of the Sacrifices to the Gods.

<span id="vi.ii.iii-p1"></span>Well, now, let us say in addition, what
inhuman demons, and hostile to the human race, your gods were, not only
delighting in the insanity of men, but gloating over human
slaughter,—now in the armed contests for superiority in the stadia, and
now in the numberless contests for renown in the wars providing for
themselves the means of pleasure, that they might be able abundantly to
satiate themselves with the murder of human beings.

<span id="vi.ii.iii-p2"></span>And now, like plagues invading cities and
nations, they demanded cruel oblations. Thus, Aristomenes the Messenian
slew three hundred human beings in honour of Ithometan Zeus, thinking
that hecatombs of such a number and quality would give good omens; among
whom was Theopompos, king of the Lacedemonians, a noble victim.

<span id="vi.ii.iii-p3"></span>The Taurians, the people who inhabit the
Tauric Chersonese, sacrifice to the Tauric Artemis forthwith whatever
strangers they lay hands on on their coasts who have been east adrift on
the sea. These sacrifices Euripides represents in tragedies on the
stage. Monimus relates, in his treatise on marvels, that at Pella, in
Thessaly, a man of Achaia was slain in sacrifice to Peleus and Chiron.
That the Lyctii, who are a Cretan race, slew men in sacrifice to Zeus,
Anticlides shows in his *Homeward Journeys;* and that the Lesbians
offered the like sacrifice to Dionysus, is said by Dosidas. The Phocæans
also (for I will not pass over such as they are), Pythocles informs us
in his third book, *On Concord*, offer a man as a burnt-sacrifice to the
Taurian Artemis.

<span id="vi.ii.iii-p4"></span>Erechtheus of Attica and Marius the
Roman <span id="fr_902"></span>[903](#fn_902.md) sacrificed their
daughters,—the former to Pherephatta, as Demaratus mentions in his first
book on *Tragic Subjects;* the latter to the evil-averting deities, as
Dorotheus relates in his first book of *Italian Affairs*. Philanthropic,
assuredly, the demons appear, from these examples; and how shall those
who revere the demons not be correspondingly pious? The former are
called by the fair name of saviours; and the latter ask for safety from
those who plot against their safety, imagining that they sacrifice with
good omens to them, and forget that they themselves are slaying men. For
a murder does not become a sacrifice by being committed in a particular
spot. You are not to call it a sacred sacrifice, if one slays a man
either at the altar or on the highway to Artemis or Zeus, any more than
if he slew him for anger or covetousness,—other demons very like the
former; but a sacrifice of this kind is murder and human butchery. Then
why is it, O men, wisest of all creatures, that you avoid wild beasts,
and get out of the way of the savage animals, if you fall in with a bear
or lion?

> <span id="vi.ii.iii-p5.1"></span> “.  .  .  .  .  As when some
> traveller spies,  
> Coiled in his path upon the mountain side,  
> A deadly snake, back he recoils in haste,—  
> His limbs all trembling, and his cheek all pale,” <span
> id="fr_903"></span>[904](#fn_903.md)  

<span id="vi.ii.iii-p7"></span>But though you perceive and understand
demons to be deadly and wicked, plotters, haters of the human race, and
destroyers, why do you not turn out of their way, or turn them out of
yours? What truth can the wicked tell, or what good can they do any one?

<span id="vi.ii.iii-p8"></span>I can then readily demonstrate that man
is better than these gods of yours, who are but demons; and can show,
for instance, that Cyrus and Solon were superior to oracular Apollo.
Your Phœbus was a lover of gifts, but not a lover of men. He betrayed
his friend Crœsus, and forgetting the reward he had got (so careful was
he of his fame), led him across the Halys to the stake. The demons love
men in such a way as to bring them to the fire \[unquenchable\].

<span id="vi.ii.iii-p9"></span>But O man, who lovest the human race
better, and art truer than Apollo, pity him that is bound on the pyre.
Do thou, O Solon, declare truth; and thou, O Cyrus, command the fire to
be extinguished. Be wise, then, at last, O Crœsus, taught by suffering.
He whom you worship is an ingrate; he accepts your reward, and after
taking the gold plays false. “Look again to the end, O Solon.” It is not
the demon, but the man that tells you this. It is not ambiguous <span
id="page_184">p. 184</span> <span id="vi.ii.iii-Page_184"></span>oracles
that Solon utters. You shall easily take him up. Nothing but true, O
Barbarian, shall you find by proof this oracle to be, when you are
placed on the pyre. Whence I cannot help wondering, by what plausible
reasons those who first went astray were impelled to preach superstition
to men, when they exhorted them to worship wicked demons, whether it was
Phoroneus or Merops, or whoever else that raised temples and altars to
them; and besides, as is fabled, were the first to offer sacrifices to
them. But, unquestionably, in succeeding ages men invented for
themselves gods to worship. It is beyond doubt that this Eros, who is
said to be among the oldest of the gods, was worshipped by no one till
Charmus took a little boy and raised an altar to him in Academia,—a
thing more seemly <span id="fr_904"></span>[905](#fn_904.md) than the lust
he had gratified; and the lewdness of vice men called by the name of
Eros, deifying thus unbridled lust. The Athenians, again, knew not who
Pan was till Philippides told them.

<span id="vi.ii.iii-p11"></span>Superstition, then, as was to be
expected, having taken its rise thus, became the fountain of insensate
wickedness; and not being subsequently checked, but having gone on
augmenting and rushing along in full flood, it became the originator of
many demons, and was displayed in sacrificing hecatombs, appointing
solemn assemblies, setting up images, and building temples, which were
in reality tombs: for I will not pass these over in silence, but make a
thorough exposure of them, though called by the august name of temples;
that is, the tombs which got the name of temples. But do ye now at
length quite give up your superstition, feeling ashamed to regard
sepulchres with religious veneration. In the temple of Athene in
Larissa, on the Acropolis, is the grave of Acrisius; and at Athens, on
the Acropolis, is that of Cecrops, as Antiochus says in the ninth book
of his *Histories*. What of Erichthonius? was he not buried in the
temple of Polias? And Immarus, the son of Eumolpus and Daira, were they
not buried in the precincts of the Elusinium, which is under the
Acropolis; and the daughters of Celeus, were they not interred in
Eleusis? Why should I enumerate to you the wives of the Hyperboreans?
They were called Hyperoche and Laodice; they were buried in the
Artemisium in Delos, which is in the temple of the Delian Apollo.
Leandrius says that Clearchus was buried in Miletus, in the Didymæum.
Following the Myndian Zeno, it were unsuitable in this connection to
pass over the sepulchre of Leucophryne, who was buried in the temple of
Artemis in Magnesia; or the altar of Apollo in Telmessus, which is
reported to be the tomb of Telmisseus the seer. Further, Ptolemy the son
of Agesarchus, in his first book about Philopator, says that Cinyras and
the descendants of Cinyras were interred in the temple of Aphrodite in
Paphos. But all time would not be sufficient for me, were I to go over
the tombs which are held sacred by you. And if no shame for these
audacious impieties steals over you, it comes to this, that you are
completely dead, putting, as really you do, your trust in the dead.
