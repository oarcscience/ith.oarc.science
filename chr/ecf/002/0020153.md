##### <span id="iv.ii.iii.xvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVI.—Uncertain Conjectures of the Philosophers.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.xvi-p1"></span>But I wish now to give you a more
accurate demonstration, God helping me, of the historical periods, that
you may see that our doctrine is not modern nor fabulous, but more
ancient and true than all poets and authors who have written in
uncertainty. For some, maintaining that the world was uncreated, went
into infinity; <span id="fr_670"></span>[671](#fn_670.md) and others,
asserting that it was created, said that already 153,075 years had
passed. This is stated by Apollonius the Egyptian. And Plato, who is
esteemed to have been the wisest of the Greeks, into what nonsense did
he run? For in his book entitled *The Republic*, <span
id="fr_671"></span>[672](#fn_671.md) we find him expressly saying: “For if
things had in all time remained in their present arrangement, when ever
could any new thing be discovered? For ten thousand times ten thousand
years elapsed without record, and one thousand or twice as many years
have gone by since some things were discovered by Dædalus, and some by
Orpheus, and some by Palamedes.” And when he says that these things
happened, he implies that ten thousand times ten thousand years elapsed
from the flood to Dædalus. And after he has said a great deal about the
cities of the world, and the settlements, and the nations, he owns that
he has said these things conjecturally. For he says, “If then, my
friend, some god should promise us, that if we attempted to make a
survey of legislation, the things now said,” <span
id="fr_672"></span>[673](#fn_672.md) etc., which shows that he was speaking
by guess; and if by guess, then what he says is not true.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.xvi-p4"></span> Plato goes on to say, that if he had
this pledge of divine assistance, he would go further in his
speculation; and therefore Theophilus argues that what he said without
this assistance he felt to be unsafe.
