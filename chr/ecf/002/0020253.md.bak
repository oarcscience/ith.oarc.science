##### <span id="vi.iii.i.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.—The Philanthropy of the Instructor.

<span id="vi.iii.i.iii-p1"></span>The Lord ministers all good and all
help, both as man and as God: as God, forgiving our sins; and as man,
training us not to sin. Man is therefore justly dear to God, since he is
His workmanship. The other works of creation He made by the word of
command alone, but man He framed by Himself, by His own hand, and
breathed into him what was peculiar to Himself. What, then, was
fashioned by Him, and after He likeness, either was created by God
Himself as <span id="page_211">p. 211</span> <span
id="vi.iii.i.iii-Page_211"></span>being desirable on its own account, or
was formed as being desirable on account of something else. If, then,
man is an object desirable for itself, then He who is good loved what is
good, and the love-charm is within even in man, and is that very thing
which is called the inspiration \[or breath\] of God; but if man was a
desirable object on account of something else, God had no other reason
for creating him, than that unless he came into being, it was not
possible for God to be a good Creator, or for man to arrive at the
knowledge of God. For God would not have accomplished that on account of
which man was created otherwise than by the creation of man; and what
hidden power in willing God possessed, He carried fully out by the
forth-putting of His might externally in the act of creating, receiving
from man what He made man; <span id="fr_1042"></span>[1043](#fn_1042.md)
and whom He had He saw, and what He wished that came to pass; and there
is nothing which God cannot do. Man, then, whom God made, is desirable
for himself, and that which is desirable on his account is allied to him
to whom it is desirable on his account; and this, too, is acceptable and
liked.

<span id="vi.iii.i.iii-p3"></span>But what is loveable, and is not also
loved by Him? And man has been proved to be loveable; consequently man
is loved by God. For how shall he not be loved for whose sake the
only-begotten Son is sent from the Father’s bosom, the Word of faith,
the faith which is superabundant; the Lord Himself distinctly confessing
and saying, “For the Father Himself loveth you, because ye have loved
Me;” <span id="fr_1043"></span>[1044](#fn_1043.md) and again, “And hast
loved them as Thou hast loved Me?” <span
id="fr_1044"></span>[1045](#fn_1044.md) What, then, the Master desires and
declares, and how He is disposed in deed and word, how He commands what
is to be done, and forbids the opposite, has already been shown.

<span id="vi.iii.i.iii-p6"></span>Plainly, then, the other kind of
discourse, the didactic, is powerful and spiritual, observing precision,
occupied in the contemplation of mysteries. But let it stand over for
the present. Now, it is incumbent on us to return His love, who lovingly
guides us to that life which is best; and to live in accordance with the
injunctions of His will, not only fulfilling what is commanded, or
guarding against what is forbidden, but turning away from some examples,
and imitating others as much as we can, and thus to perform the works of
the Master according to His similitude, and so fulfil what Scripture
says as to our being made in His image and likeness. For, wandering in
life as in deep darkness, we need a guide that cannot stumble or stray;
and our guide is the best, not blind, as the Scripture says, “leading
the blind into pits.” <span id="fr_1045"></span>[1046](#fn_1045.md) But the
Word is keen-sighted, and scans the recesses of the heart. As, then,
that is not light which enlightens not, nor motion that moves not, nor
loving which loves not, so neither is that good which profits not, nor
guides to salvation. Let us then aim at the fulfilment of the
commandments by the works of the Lord; for the Word Himself also, having
openly become flesh, <span id="fr_1046"></span>[1047](#fn_1046.md)
exhibited the same virtue, both practical and contemplative. Wherefore
let us regard the Word as law, and His commands and counsels as the
short and straight paths to immortality; for His precepts are full of
persuasion, not of fear.

<span id="vi.iii.i.iii-p2"></span> Bishop Kaye (*Some Account of the
Writings and Opinions of Clement of Alexandria*, p. 48) translates,
“receiving from man that which made man (that on account of which man
was made).” But it seems more likely that Clement refers to the ideal
man in the divine mind, whom he indentifies elsewhere with the Logos,
the <span class="Greek"><span id="vi.iii.i.iii-p2.1"></span>ἄνθρωπος
ἀπαθής</span>, of whom man was the image. The reader will notice that
Clement speaks of man as existing in the divine mind before his
creation, and creation is represented by God’s *seeing* what He had
previously within Him merely as a hidden power.
