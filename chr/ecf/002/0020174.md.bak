##### <span id="v.ii.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.—The Christians are Not Atheists, But Acknowledge One Only God.

<span id="v.ii.iv-p1"></span>As regards, first of all, the allegation
that we are atheists—for I will meet the charges one <span
id="page_131">p. 131</span> <span id="v.ii.iv-Page_131"></span>by one,
that we may not be ridiculed for having no answer to give to those who
make them—with reason did the Athenians adjudge Diagoras guilty of
atheism, in that he not only divulged the Orphic doctrine, and published
the mysteries of Eleusis and of the Cabiri, and chopped up the wooden
statue of Hercules to boil his turnips, but openly declared that there
was no God at all. But to us, who distinguish God from matter, <span
id="fr_707"></span>[708](#fn_707.md) and teach that matter is one thing and
God another, and that they are separated by a wide interval (for that
the Deity is uncreated and eternal, to be beheld by the understanding
and reason alone, while matter is created and perishable), is it not
absurd to apply the name of atheism? If our sentiments were like those
of Diagoras, while we have such incentives to piety—in the established
order, the universal harmony, the magnitude, the colour, the form, the
arrangement of the world—with reason might our reputation for impiety,
as well as the cause of our being thus harassed, be charged on
ourselves. But, since our doctrine acknowledges one God, the Maker of
this universe, who is Himself uncreated (for that which is does not come
to be, but that which is not) but has made all things by the Logos which
is from Him, we are treated unreasonably in both respects, in that we
are both defamed and persecuted.
