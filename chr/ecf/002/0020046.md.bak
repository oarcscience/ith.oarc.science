##### <span id="iii.ii.x-p0.1"></span>Chapter X.—Ridicule of the Heathen Divinities.

<span id="iii.ii.x-p1"></span>There are legends of the metamorphosis of
men: with you the gods also are metamorphosed. Rhea becomes a tree; Zeus
a dragon, on account of Persephone; the sisters of Phaëthon are changed
into poplars, and Leto into a bird of little value, on whose account
what is now Delos was called Ortygia. A god, forsooth, becomes a swan,
or takes the form of an eagle, and, making Ganymede his cupbearer,
glories in a vile affection. How can I reverence gods who are eager for
presents, and angry if they do not receive them? Let them have their
Fate! I am not willing to adore wandering stars. What is that hair of
Berenicé? Where were her stars before her death? And how was the dead
Antinous fixed as a beautiful youth in the moon? Who carried him
thither: unless perchance, as men, perjuring themselves for hire, are
credited when they say in ridicule of the gods that kings have ascended
into heaven, so some one, in like manner, has put this man also among
the gods, <span id="fr_449"></span>[450](#fn_449.md) and been recompensed
with honour and reward? Why have you robbed God? Why do you dishonour
His workmanship? You sacrifice a sheep, and you adore the same animal.
The Bull is in the heavens, and you slaughter its image. The
Kneeler <span id="fr_450"></span>[451](#fn_450.md) crushes a noxious
animal; and the eagle that devours the man-maker Prometheus is honoured.
The swan is noble, forsooth, because it was an adulterer; and the
Dioscuri, living on alternate days, the ravishers of the daughters of
Leucippus, are also noble! Better still is Helen, who forsook the
flaxen-haired Menelaus, and followed the turbaned and gold-adorned
Paris. A just man also is Sophron, <span
id="fr_451"></span>[452](#fn_451.md) who transported this adulteress to the
Elysian fields! But even the daughter of Tyndarus is not gifted with
immortality, and Euripides has wisely represented this woman as put to
death by Orestes.
