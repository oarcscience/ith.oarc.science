##### <span id="vi.iv.ii.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.—Faith Not a Product of Nature.

<span id="vi.iv.ii.iii-p1"></span>Now the followers of Basilides regard
faith as natural, as they also refer it to choice, \[representing it\]
as finding ideas by intellectual comprehension without demonstration;
while the followers of Valentinus assign faith to us, the simple, but
will have it that knowledge springs up in their own selves (who are
saved by nature) through the advantage of a germ of superior excellence,
saying that it is as far removed from faith as <span
id="fr_2175"></span>[2176](#fn_2175.md) the spiritual is from the animal.
Further, the followers of Basilides say that faith as well as choice is
proper according to every interval; and that in consequence of the
supramundane selection mundane faith accompanies all nature, and that
the free gift of faith is comformable to the hope of each. Faith, then,
is no longer the direct result of free choice, if it is a natural
advantage.

<span id="vi.iv.ii.iii-p3"></span>Nor will he who has not believed, not
being the author \[of his unbelief\], meet with a due recompense; and he
that has believed is not the cause \[of his belief\]. And the entire
peculiarity and difference of belief and unbelief will not fall under
either praise or censure, if we reflect rightly, since there attaches to
it the antecedent natural necessity proceeding from the Almighty. And if
we are pulled like inanimate things by the puppet-strings of natural
powers, willingness <span id="fr_2176"></span>[2177](#fn_2176.md) and
unwillingness, and impulse, which is the antecedent of both, are mere
redundancies. And for my part, I am utterly incapable of conceiving such
an animal as has its appetencies, which are moved by external causes,
under the dominion of necessity. And what place is there any longer for
the repentance of him who was once an unbeliever, through which comes
forgiveness of sins? So that neither is baptism rational, nor the
blessed seal, <span id="fr_2177"></span>[2178](#fn_2177.md) nor the Son,
nor the Father. But God, as I think, turns out to be the distribution to
men of natural powers, which has not as the foundation of salvation
voluntary faith.

hands after baptism. \[For an almost pontifical decision as to this
whole matter, with a very just eulogy of the German (Lutheran)
confirmation-office, see Bunsen, *Hippol*., iii. pp. 214, 369.\]
