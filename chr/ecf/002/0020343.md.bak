<span id="vi.iv.ii.xix"></span>

##### <span id="vi.iv.ii.xix-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIX.—The True Gnostic is an Imitator of God, Especially in Beneficence.

<span id="vi.iv.ii.xix-p1"></span>He is the Gnostic, who is after the
image and likeness of God, who imitates God as far as possible,
deficient in none of the things which contribute to the likeness as far
as compatible, practising self-restraint and endurance, living
righteously, reigning over the passions, bestowing of what he has as far
as possible, and doing good both by word and deed. “He is the greatest,”
it is said, “in the kingdom who shall do and teach;” <span
id="fr_2369"></span>[2370](#fn_2369.md) imitating God in conferring like
benefits. For God’s gifts are for the common good. “Whoever shall
attempt to do aught with presumption, provokes God,” <span
id="fr_2370"></span>[2371](#fn_2370.md) it is said. For haughtiness is a
vice of the soul, of which, as of other sins, He commands us to repent;
by adjusting our lives from their state of derangement to the change for
the better in these three things—mouth, heart, hands. These are
signs—the hands of action, the heart of volition, the mouth of speech.
Beautifully, therefore, has this oracle been spoken with respect to
penitents: “Thou hast chosen God this day to be thy God; and God hath
chosen thee this day to be His people.” <span
id="fr_2371"></span>[2372](#fn_2371.md) For him who hastes to serve the
self-existent One, being a suppliant, <span
id="fr_2372"></span>[2373](#fn_2372.md) God adopts to Himself; and though
he be only one in number, he is honoured equally with the people. For
being a part of the people, he becomes complementary of it, being
restored from what he was; and the whole is named from a part.

<span id="vi.iv.ii.xix-p6"></span>But nobility is itself exhibited in
choosing and practising what is best. For what benefit to Adam was such
a nobility as he had? No mortal was his father; for he himself was
father of men that are born. What is base he readily chose, following
his wife, and neglected what is true and good; on which account he
exchanged his immortal life for a mortal life, but not for ever. And
Noah, whose origin was not the same as Adam’s, was saved by divine care.
For he took and consecrated himself to God. And Abraham, who had
children by three wives, not for the indulgence of pleasure, but in the
hope, as I think, of multiplying the race at the first, was succeeded by
one alone, who was heir of his father’s blessings, while the rest were
separated from the family; and of the twins who sprang from him, the
younger having won his father’s favour and received his prayers, became
heir, and the elder served him. For it is the greatest boon to a bad man
not to be master of himself. <span id="fr_2373"></span>[2374](#fn_2373.md)

<span id="vi.iv.ii.xix-p8"></span>And this arrangement was prophetical
and typical. And that all things belong to the wise, Scripture clearly
indicates when it is said, “Because God hath had mercy on me, I have all
things.” <span id="fr_2374"></span>[2375](#fn_2374.md) For it teaches that
we are to desire one thing, by which are all things, and what is
promised is assigned to the worthy. Accordingly, the good man who has
become heir of the kingdom, it registers also as fellow-citizen, through
divine wisdom, with the righteous of the olden time, who under the law
and before the law lived according to law, whose deeds have become laws
to us; and again, teaching that the wise man is king, introduces people
of a different race, saying to him, “Thou art a king before God among
us;” <span id="fr_2375"></span>[2376](#fn_2375.md) those who were governed
obeying the good man of their own accord, from admiration of his virtue.

<span id="vi.iv.ii.xix-p11"></span>Now Plato the philosopher, defining
the end of happiness, says that it is likeness to God as far as
possible; whether concurring with the precept of the law (for great
natures that are free of passions somehow hit the mark respecting the
truth, as the Pythagorean Philo says in relating the history of Moses),
or whether instructed by certain oracles of the time, thirsting as he
always was for instruction. For the law says, “Walk after the Lord your
God, and keep my commandments.” <span
id="fr_2376"></span>[2377](#fn_2376.md) For the law calls assimilation
following; and such a following to the utmost of its power assimilates.
“Be,” says the Lord, “merciful and pitiful, as your heavenly Father is
pitiful.” <span id="fr_2377"></span>[2378](#fn_2377.md) Thence also the
Stoics have laid down the doctrine, that living agreeably to nature is
the end, fitly altering the name of God into nature; since also nature
extends to plants, to seeds, to trees, and to stones. It is therefore
plainly said, “Bad men do not understand the law; but they who love the
law fortify themselves with a wall.” <span
id="fr_2378"></span>[2379](#fn_2378.md) “For the wisdom of the clever knows
its ways; but the folly of the foolish is in error.” <span
id="fr_2379"></span>[2380](#fn_2379.md) “For on whom will I look, but on
him who is mild and gentle, and trembleth at my words?” says the
prophecy.

<span id="vi.iv.ii.xix-p16"></span>We are taught that there are three
kinds of friendship: and that of these the first and the best is that
which results from virtue, for the love that is founded on reason is
firm; that the second and intermediate is by way of recompense, and is
social, liberal, and useful for life; for the friendship which is the
result of favour is mutual. <span id="page_370">p. 370</span> <span
id="vi.iv.ii.xix-Page_370"></span>And the third and last *we* assert to
be that which is founded on intimacy; others, again, that it is that
variable and changeable form which rests on pleasure. And Hippodamus the
Pythagorean seems to me to describe friendships most admirably: “That
founded on knowledge of the gods, that founded on the gifts of men, and
that on the pleasures of animals.” There is the friendship of a
philosopher,—that of a man and that of an animal. For the image of God
is really the man who does good, in which also he gets good: as the
pilot at once saves, and is saved. Wherefore, when one obtains his
request, he does not say to the giver, Thou hast given well, but, Thou
hast received well. So he receives who gives, and he gives who receives.
“But the righteous pity and show mercy.” <span
id="fr_2380"></span>[2381](#fn_2380.md) “But the mild shall be inhabitants
of the earth, and the innocent shall be left in it. But the
transgressors shall be extirpated from it.” <span
id="fr_2381"></span>[2382](#fn_2381.md) And Homer seems to me to have said
prophetically of the faithful, “Give to thy friend.” And an enemy must
be aided, that he may not continue an enemy. For by help good feeling is
compacted, and enmity dissolved. “But if there be present readiness of
mind, according to what a man hath it is acceptable, and not according
to what he hath not: for it is not that there be ease to others, but
tribulation to you, but of equality at the present time,” and so
forth. <span id="fr_2382"></span>[2383](#fn_2382.md) “He hath dispersed, he
hath given to the poor; his righteousness endureth for ever,” the
Scripture says. <span id="fr_2383"></span>[2384](#fn_2383.md) For
conformity with the image and likeness is not meant of the body (for it
were wrong for what is mortal to be made like what is immortal), but in
mind and reason, on which fitly the Lord impresses the seal of likeness,
both in respect of doing good and of exercising rule. For governments
are directed not by corporeal qualities, but by judgments of the mind.
For by the counsels of holy men states are managed well, and the
household also.
