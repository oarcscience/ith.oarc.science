##### <span id="vi.iv.vii.xiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIV.—Description of the Gnostic Furnished by an Exposition of [1 Cor. vi. 1](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#001.md)<span id="vi.iv.vii.xiv-p0.2"></span>, Etc.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xiv-p1"></span>Now, of what I may call the
passionlessness which we attribute to the Gnostic (in which the
perfection of the believer, “advancing by love, comes to a perfect man,
to the measure of full stature,” <span
id="fr_3644"></span>[3645](#fn_3644.md) by being assimilated to God, and by
becoming truly angelic), many other testimonies from the Scripture,
occur to me to adduce. But I think it better, on account of the length
of the discourse, that such an honour should be devolved on those who
wish to take pains, and leave it to them to elaborate the dogmas by the
selection of Scriptures.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xiv-p3"></span>One passage, accordingly, I shall in
the briefest terms advert to, so as not to leave the topic unexplained.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xiv-p4"></span>For in the first Epistle to the
Corinthians the divine apostle says: “Dare any of you, having a matter
against the other, go to law before the unrighteous, and not before the
saints? Know ye not that the saints shall judge the world?” <span
id="fr_3645"></span>[3646](#fn_3645.md) and so on.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xiv-p6"></span>The section being very long, we shall
exhibit the meaning of the apostle’s utterance by employing <span
id="page_548">p. 548</span> <span
id="vi.iv.vii.xiv-Page_548"></span>such of the apostolic expressions as
are most pertinent, and in the briefest language, and in a sort of
cursory way, interpreting the discourse in which he describes the
perfection of the Gnostic. For he does not merely instance the Gnostic
as characterized by suffering wrong rather than do wrong; but he teaches
that he is not mindful of injuries, and does not allow him even to pray
against the man who has done him wrong. For he knows that the Lord
expressly enjoined “to pray for enemies.” <span
id="fr_3646"></span>[3647](#fn_3646.md)

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xiv-p8"></span>To say, then, that the man who has
been injured goes to law before the unrighteous, is nothing else than to
say that he shows a wish to retaliate, and a desire to injure the second
in return, which is also to do wrong likewise himself.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xiv-p9"></span>And his saying, that he wishes “some
to go to law before the saints,” points out those who ask by prayer that
those who have done wrong should suffer retaliation for their injustice,
and intimates that the second are better than the former; but they are
not yet obedient, <span id="fr_3647"></span>[3648](#fn_3647.md) if they do
not, having become entirely free of resentment, pray even for their
enemies.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xiv-p11"></span>It is well, then, for them to
receive right dispositions from repentance, which results in faith. For
if the truth seems to get enemies who entertain bad feeling, yet it is
not hostile to any one. “For God makes His sun to shine on the just and
on the unjust,” <span id="fr_3648"></span>[3649](#fn_3648.md) and sent the
Lord Himself to the just and the unjust. And he that earnestly strives
to be assimilated to God, in the exercise of great absence of
resentment, forgives seventy times seven times, as it were all his life
through, and in all his course in this world (that being indicated by
the enumeration of sevens) shows clemency to each and any one; if any
during the whole time of his life in the flesh do the Gnostic wrong. For
he not only deems it right that the good man should resign his property
alone to others, being of the number of those who have done him wrong;
but also wishes that the righteous man should ask of those judges
forgiveness for the offences of those who have done him wrong. And with
reason, if indeed it is only in that which is external and concerns the
body, though it go to the extent of death even, that those who attempt
to wrong him take advantage of him; none of which truly belong to the
Gnostic.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xiv-p13"></span>And how shall one “judge” the
apostate “angels,” who has become himself an apostate from that
forgetfulness of injuries, which is according to the Gospel? “Why do ye
not rather suffer wrong?” he says; “why are ye not rather defrauded?
Yea, ye do wrong and defraud,” <span
id="fr_3649"></span>[3650](#fn_3649.md) manifestly by praying against those
who transgress in ignorance, and deprive of the philanthropy and
goodness of God, as far as in you lies, those against whom you pray,
“and these your brethren,”—not meaning those in the faith only, but also
the proselytes. For whether he who now is hostile shall afterwards
believe, we know not as yet. From which the conclusion follows clearly,
if all are not yet brethren to us, they ought to be regarded in that
light. And now it is only the man of knowledge who recognises all men to
be the work of one God, and invested with one image in one nature,
although some may be more turbid than others; and in the creatures he
recognises the operation, by which again he adores the will of God.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xiv-p15"></span>“Know ye not that the unrighteous
shall not inherit the kingdom of God?” <span
id="fr_3650"></span>[3651](#fn_3650.md) He acts unrighteously who
retaliates, whether by deed or word, or by the conception of a wish,
which, after the training of the Law, the Gospel rejects.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xiv-p17"></span>“And such were some of you”—such
manifestly as those still are whom you do not forgive; “but ye are
washed,” <span id="fr_3651"></span>[3652](#fn_3651.md) not simply as the
rest, but with knowledge; ye have cast off the passions of the soul, in
order to become assimilated, as far as possible, to the goodness of
God’s providence by long-suffering, and by forgiveness “towards the just
and the unjust,” casting on them the gleam of benignity in word and
deeds, as the sun.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xiv-p19"></span>The Gnostic will achieve this either
by greatness of mind, or by imitation of what is better. And that is a
third cause. “Forgive, and it shall be forgiven you;” the commandment,
as it were, compelling to salvation through superabundance of goodness.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xiv-p20"></span>“But ye are sanctified.” For he who
has come to this state is in a condition to be holy, falling into none
of the passions in any way, but as it were already disembodied and
already grown holy without <span id="fr_3652"></span>[3653](#fn_3652.md)
this earth.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xiv-p22"></span>“Wherefore,” he says, “ye are
justified in the name of the Lord.” Ye are made, so to speak, by Him to
be righteous as He is, and are blended as far as possible with the Holy
Spirit. For “are not all things lawful to me? yet I will not be brought
under the power of any,” <span id="fr_3653"></span>[3654](#fn_3653.md) so
as to do, or think, or speak aught contrary to the Gospel. “Meats for
the belly, and the belly for meats, which God shall destroy,” <span
id="fr_3654"></span>[3655](#fn_3654.md) —that is, such as think and live as
if they were made for eating, and do not eat that they may live as a
consequence, and apply to knowledge as the primary end. And does he not
say that these are, as it were, the fleshy parts of the holy body? As a
<span id="page_549">p. 549</span> <span
id="vi.iv.vii.xiv-Page_549"></span>body, the Church of the Lord, the
spiritual and holy choir, is symbolized. <span
id="fr_3655"></span>[3656](#fn_3655.md) Whence those, who are merely
called, but do not live in accordance with the word, are the fleshy
parts. “Now” this spiritual “body,” the holy Church, “is not for
fornication.” Nor are those things which belong to heathen life to be
adopted by apostasy from the Gospel. For he who conducts himself
heathenishly in the Church, whether in deed, or word, or even in
thought, commits fornication with reference to the Church and his own
body. He who in this way “is joined to the harlot,” that is, to conduct
contrary to the Covenant becomes another “body,” not holy, “and one
flesh,” and has a heathenish life and another hope. “But he that is
joined to the Lord in spirit” becomes a spiritual body by a different
kind of conjunction.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xiv-p26"></span>Such an one is wholly a son, an holy
man, passionless, gnostic, perfect, formed by the teaching of the Lord;
in order that in deed, in word, and in spirit itself, being brought
close to the Lord, he may receive the mansion that is due to him who has
reached manhood thus.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xiv-p27"></span>Let the specimen suffice to those
who have ears. For it is not required to unfold the mystery, but only to
indicate what is sufficient for those who are partakers in knowledge to
bring it to mind; who also will comprehend how it was said by the Lord,
“Be ye perfect as your father, perfectly,” <span
id="fr_3656"></span>[3657](#fn_3656.md) by forgiving sins, and forgetting
injuries, and living in the habit of passionlessness. For as we call a
physician perfect, and a philosopher perfect, so also, in my view, do we
call a Gnostic perfect. But not one of those points, although of the
greatest importance, is assumed in order to the likeness of God. For we
do not say, as the Stoics do most impiously, that virtue in man and God
is the same. Ought we not then to be perfect, as the Father wills? For
it is utterly impossible for any one to become perfect as God is. Now
the Father wishes us to be perfect by living blamelessly, according to
the obedience of the Gospel.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xiv-p29"></span>If, then, the statement being
elliptical, we understand what is wanting, in order to complete the
section for those who are incapable of understanding what is left out,
we shall both know the will of God, and shall walk at once piously and
magnanimously, as befits the dignity of the commandment.
