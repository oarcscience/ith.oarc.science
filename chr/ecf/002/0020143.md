##### <span id="iv.ii.iii.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.—Other Opinions of the Philosophers.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.vi-p1"></span>And regarding lawless conduct, those
who have blindly wandered into the choir of philosophy have, almost to a
man, spoken with one voice. Certainly Plato, to mention him first who
seems to have been the most respectable philosopher among them,
expressly, as it were, legislates in his first book, <span
id="fr_641"></span>[642](#fn_641.md) entitled *The Republic*, that the
wives of all be common, using the precedent of the son <span
id="fr_642"></span>[643](#fn_642.md) of Jupiter and the lawgiver of the
Cretans, in order that under this pretext there might be an abundant
offspring from the best persons, and that those who were worn with toil
might be comforted by such intercourse. <span
id="fr_643"></span>[644](#fn_643.md) And Epicurus himself, too, as well as
teaching atheism, teaches along with it incest with mothers and sisters,
and this in transgression of the laws which forbid it; for Solon
distinctly legislated regarding this, in order that from a married
parent children might lawfully spring, that they might not be born of
adultery, so that no one should honour as his father him who was not his
father, or dishonour him who was really his father, through ignorance
that he was so. And these things the other laws of the Romans and Greeks
also prohibit. Why, then, do Epicurus and the Stoics teach incest and
sodomy, with which doctrines they have filled libraries, so that from
boyhood <span id="fr_644"></span>[645](#fn_644.md) this lawless intercourse
is learned? And why should I further spend time on them, since even of
those they call gods they relate similar things?

<span id="iv.ii.iii.vi-p4"></span> As this sentence cannot be
intelligibly rendered without its original in Plato, we subjoin the
latter: “As for those youths who excel either in war or other pursuits,
they ought both to have other rewards and prizes given them; and
specially this, of being allowed the freest intercourse with women,
that, at the same time, under this pretext the greatest number of
children may spring from such parents.”

some passages of Hermas, and shows with what delicacy he has reproved
the gross vices with which Christians could not escape familiarity.\]
