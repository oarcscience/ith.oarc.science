##### <span id="vi.iv.i.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.—Human Arts as Well as Divine Knowledge Proceed from God.

<span id="vi.iv.i.iv-p1"></span>Homer calls an artificer wise; and of
Margites, if that is his work, he thus writes:—

> <span id="vi.iv.i.iv-p1.1"></span> “Him, then, the Gods made neither a
> delver nor a ploughman,  
> Nor in any other respect wise; but he missed every art.”  

<span id="vi.iv.i.iv-p2"></span>Hesiod further said the musician Linus
was “skilled in all manner of wisdom;” and does not hesitate to call a
mariner wise, seeing he writes:—

> <span id="vi.iv.i.iv-p2.1"></span> “Having no wisdom in navigation.”  

<span id="vi.iv.i.iv-p3"></span>And Daniel the prophet says, “The
mystery which the king asks, it is not in the power of the wise, the
Magi, the diviners, the Gazarenes, to tell the king; but it is God in
heaven who revealeth it.” <span id="fr_1842"></span>[1843](#fn_1842.md)

<span id="vi.iv.i.iv-p5"></span>Here he terms the Babylonians wise. And
that Scripture calls every secular science or art by the one name wisdom
(there are other arts and sciences invented over and above by human
reason), and that artistic and skilful invention is from God, will be
clear if we adduce the following <span id="page_305">p. 305</span> <span
id="vi.iv.i.iv-Page_305"></span>statement: “And the Lord spake to Moses,
See, I have called Bezaleel, the son of Uri, the son of Or, of the tribe
of Judah; and I have filled him with the divine spirit of wisdom, and
understanding, and knowledge, to devise and to execute in all manner of
work, to work gold, and silver, and brass, and blue, and purple, and
scarlet, and in working stone work, and in the art of working wood,” and
even to “all works.” <span id="fr_1843"></span>[1844](#fn_1843.md) And then
He adds the general reason, “And to every understanding heart I have
given understanding;” <span id="fr_1844"></span>[1845](#fn_1844.md) that
is, to every one capable of acquiring it by pains and exercise. And
again, it is written expressly in the name of the Lord: “And speak thou
to all that are wise in mind, whom I have filled with the spirit of
perception.” <span id="fr_1845"></span>[1846](#fn_1845.md)

<span id="vi.iv.i.iv-p9"></span>Those who are wise in mind have a
certain attribute of nature peculiar to themselves; and they who have
shown themselves capable, receive from the Supreme Wisdom a spirit of
perception in double measure. For those who practice the common arts,
are in what pertains to the senses highly gifted: in hearing, he who is
commonly called a musician; in touch, he who moulds clay; in voice the
singer, in smell the perfumer, in sight the engraver of devices on
seals. Those also that are occupied in instruction, train the
sensibility according to which the poets are susceptible to the
influence of measure; the sophists apprehend expression; the
dialecticians, syllogisms; and the philosophers are capable of the
contemplation of which themselves are the objects. For sensibility finds
and invents; since it persuasively exhorts to application. And practice
will increase the application which has knowledge for its end. With
reason, therefore, the apostle has called the wisdom of God “manifold,”
and which has manifested its power “in many departments and in many
modes” <span id="fr_1846"></span>[1847](#fn_1846.md) —by art, by knowledge,
by faith, by prophecy—for our benefit. “For all wisdom is from the Lord,
and is with Him for ever,” as says the wisdom of Jesus. <span
id="fr_1847"></span>[1848](#fn_1847.md)

<span id="vi.iv.i.iv-p12"></span>For if thou call on wisdom and
knowledge with a loud voice, and seek it as treasures of silver, and
eagerly track it out, thou shalt understand godliness and find divine
knowledge.” <span id="fr_1848"></span>[1849](#fn_1848.md) The prophet says
this in contradiction to the knowledge according to philosophy, which
teaches us to investigate in a magnanimous and noble manner, for our
progress in piety. He opposes, therefore, to it the knowledge which is
occupied with piety, when referring to knowledge, when he speaks as
follows: “For God gives wisdom out of His own mouth, and knowledge along
with understanding, and treasures up help for the righteous.” For to
those who have been justified <span id="fr_1849"></span>[1850](#fn_1849.md)
by philosophy, the knowledge which leads to piety is laid up as a help.
