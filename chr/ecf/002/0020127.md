##### <span id="iv.ii.ii.xxix-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXIX.—Cain’s Crime.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xxix-p1"></span>When, then, Adam knew Eve his wife,
she conceived and bare a son, whose name was Cain; and she said, “I have
gotten a man from God.” And yet again she bare a second son, whose name
was Abel, “who began to be a keeper of sheep, but Cain tilled the
ground.” <span id="fr_606"></span>[607](#fn_606) Their history receives
a very full narration, yea, even a detailed explanation: <span
id="fr_607"></span>[608](#fn_607) wherefore the book itself, which is
entitled “The Genesis of the World,” can more accurately inform those
who are anxious to learn their story. When, then, Satan saw Adam and his
wife not only still living, but also begetting children—being carried
away with spite because he had not succeeded in putting them to
death,—when he saw that Abel was well-pleasing to God, he wrought upon
the heart of his brother called Cain, and caused him to kill his brother
Abel. And thus did death get a beginning in this world, to find its way
into every race of man, even to this day. But God, being pitiful, and
wishing to afford to Cain, as to Adam, an opportunity of repentance and
confession, said, “Where is Abel thy brother?” But Cain answered God
contumaciously, <span id="page_106">p. 106</span> <span
id="iv.ii.ii.xxix-Page_106"></span>saying, “I know not; am I my
brother’s keeper?” God, being thus made angry with him, said, “What hast
thou done? The voice of thy brother’s blood crieth to me from the earth,
which opened her mouth to receive thy brother’s blood from thy hand.
Groaning and trembling shalt thou be on the earth.” From that time the
earth, through fear, no longer receives human blood, <span
id="fr_608"></span>[609](#fn_608) no, nor the blood of any animal; by
which it appears that it is not the cause \[of death\], but man, who
transgressed.

coagulates, and does not easily enter the earth.” \[On the field of
Antietam, after the battle, I observed the blood *flaked* upon the soil,
not absorbed by it.\]
