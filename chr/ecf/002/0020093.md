##### <span id="iv.ii.i.x-p0.1"></span>Chapter X.—Absurdities of Idolatry.

<span id="iv.ii.i.x-p1"></span>Why should I further recount the
multitude of animals worshipped by the Egyptians, both reptiles, and
cattle, and wild beasts, and birds, and river-fishes; and even
wash-pots <span id="fr_537"></span>[538](#fn_537) and disgraceful
noises? <span id="fr_538"></span>[539](#fn_538) But if you cite the
Greeks and the other nations, they worship stones and wood, and other
kinds of material substances,—the images, as we have just been saying,
of dead men. For Phidias is found in Pisa making for the Eleians the
Olympian Jupiter, and at Athens the Minerva of the Acropolis. And I will
inquire of you, my friend, how many Jupiters exist. For there is,
firstly, Jupiter surnamed Olympian, then Jupiter Latiaris, and Jupiter
Cassius, and Jupiter Tonans, and Jupiter Propator, and Jupiter
Pannychius, and Jupiter Poliuchus, and Jupiter Capitolinus; and that
Jupiter, the son of Saturn, who is king of the Cretans, has a tomb in
Crete, but the rest, possibly, were not thought worthy of tombs. And if
you speak of the mother of those who are called gods, far be it from me
to utter with my lips her deeds, or the deeds of those by whom she is
worshipped (for it is unlawful for us so much as to name such things),
and what vast taxes and revenues she and her sons furnish to the king.
For these are not gods, but idols, as we have already said, the works of
men’s hands and unclean demons. And such may all those become who make
them and put their trust in them!
