##### <span id="vi.iv.i.xx-p0.1"></span>Chapter XX.—In What Respect Philosophy Contributes to the Comprehension of Divine Truth.

<span id="vi.iv.i.xx-p1"></span>As many men drawing down the ship,
cannot be called many causes, but one cause consisting of many;—for each
individual by himself is not the cause of the ship being drawn, but
along with the rest;—so also philosophy, being the search for truth,
contributes to the comprehension of truth; not as being the cause of
comprehension, but a cause along with other things, and co-operator;
perhaps also a joint cause. And as the several virtues are causes of the
happiness of one individual; and as both the sun, and the fire, and the
bath, and clothing are of one getting warm: so while truth is one, many
things contribute to its investigation. But its discovery is by the Son.
If then we consider, virtue is, in power, one. But it is the case, that
when exhibited in some things, it is called prudence, in others
temperance, and in others manliness or righteousness. By the same
analogy, while truth is one, in geometry there is the truth of geometry;
in music, that of music; and in the right philosophy, there will be
Hellenic truth. But that is the only authentic truth, unassailable, in
which we are instructed by the Son of God. In the same way we say, that
the drachma being one and the same, when given to the shipmaster, is
called the fare; to the tax-gatherer, tax; to the landlord, rent; to the
teacher, fees; to the seller, an earnest. And each, whether it be virtue
or truth, called by the same name, is the cause of its own peculiar
effect alone; and from the blending of them arises a happy life. For we
are not made happy by names alone, when we say that a good life is
happiness, and that the man who is adorned in his soul with virtue is
happy. But if philosophy contributes remotely to the discovery of truth,
by reaching, by diverse essays, after the knowledge which touches close
on the truth, the knowledge possessed by us, it aids him who aims at
grasping it, in accordance with the Word, to apprehend knowledge. But
the Hellenic truth is distinct from that held by us (although it has got
the same name), both in respect of extent of knowledge, certainly of
demonstration, divine power, and the like. For we are taught of God,
being instructed in the truly “sacred letters” <span
id="fr_2024"></span>[2025](#fn_2024.md) by the Son of God. Whence those, to
whom we refer, influence souls not in the way we do, but by different
teaching. And if, for the sake of those who are fond of fault-finding,
we must draw a distinction, by saying that philosophy is a concurrent
and cooperating cause of true apprehension, being the search for truth,
then we shall avow it to be a preparatory training for the enlightened
man (<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.iv.i.xx-p2.3"></span>τοῦ
γνωστικοῦ</span>); not assigning as the cause that which is but the
joint-cause; nor as the upholding cause, what is merely co-operative;
nor giving to philosophy the place of a *sine quâ non*. Since almost all
of us, without training in arts and sciences, and the Hellenic
philosophy, and some even without learning at all, through the influence
of a philosophy divine and barbarous, and by power, have through faith
received the word concerning God, trained by self-operating wisdom. But
that which acts in conjunction with something else, being of itself
incapable of operating by itself, we describe as co-operating and
concausing, and say that it becomes a cause only in virtue of its being
a joint-cause, and receives the name of cause only in respect of its
concurring with something else, but that it cannot by itself produce the
right effect.

<span id="vi.iv.i.xx-p3"></span>Although at one time philosophy
justified the Greeks, <span id="fr_2025"></span>[2026](#fn_2025.md) not
conducting them to that entire righteousness to which it is ascertained
to cooperate, as the first and second flight of steps help you in your
ascent to the upper room, and the grammarian helps the philosopher. Not
as if by its abstraction, the perfect Word would be rendered incomplete,
or truth perish; since also sight, and hearing, and the voice contribute
to truth, but it is the mind which is the appropriate faculty for
knowing it. But of those things which co-operate, some contribute a
greater amount of power; some, a less. Perspicuity accordingly aids in
the communication of truth, and logic in preventing us from falling
under the heresies by which we are assailed. But the teaching, which is
according to the Saviour, is complete in itself and without defect,
being “the power and wisdom of God;” <span
id="fr_2026"></span>[2027](#fn_2026.md) and the Hellenic philosophy does
not, by its approach, make the truth more powerful; but rendering
powerless the assault of sophistry against it, and frustrating the
treacherous plots laid against the truth, is said to be the proper
“fence and wall of the vineyard.” And the truth which is according to
faith is as necessary for life as bread; while the preparatory
discipline is like sauce and sweetmeats. “At the end of the dinner, the
dessert is pleasant,” according to the Theban Pindar. And the Scripture
has expressly said, “The innocent will become wiser by understanding,
and the wise will receive knowledge.” <span
id="fr_2027"></span>[2028](#fn_2027.md) “And he that speaketh of himself,”
saith the Lord, “seeketh his own glory; but He that seeketh His glory
that sent Him is true, and there is no unrighteousness in Him.” <span
id="fr_2028"></span>[2029](#fn_2028.md) On the other hand, therefore, he
who appropriates what belongs to the barbarians, <span id="page_324">p.
324</span> <span id="vi.iv.i.xx-Page_324"></span>and vaunts it is his
own, does wrong, increasing his own glory, and falsifying the truth. It
is such an one that is by Scripture called a “thief.” It is therefore
said, “Son, be not a liar; for falsehood leads to theft.” Nevertheless
the thief possesses really, what he has possessed himself of
dishonestly, <span id="fr_2029"></span>[2030](#fn_2029.md) whether it be
gold, or silver, or speech, or dogma. The ideas, then, which they have
stolen, and which are partially true, they know by conjecture and
necessary logical deduction: on becoming disciples, therefore, they will
know them with intelligent apprehension.
