##### <span id="vi.iv.i.xviii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.—He Illustrates the Apostle’s Saying, “I Will Destroy the Wisdom of the Wise.”

<span id="vi.iv.i.xviii-p1"></span>And of such it is said, “I will
destroy the wisdom of the wise: I will bring to nothing the
understanding of the prudent.” The apostle accordingly adds, “Where is
the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the disputer of this world?”
setting in contradistinction to the scribes, the disputers <span
id="fr_1995"></span>[1996](#fn_1995.md) of this world, the philosophers of
the Gentiles. “Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?” <span
id="fr_1996"></span>[1997](#fn_1996.md) which is equivalent to, showed it
to be foolish, and not true, as they thought. And if you ask the cause
of their seeming wisdom, he will say, “because of the blindness of their
heart;” since “in the wisdom of God,” that is, as proclaimed by the
prophets, “the world knew not,” in the wisdom “which spake by the
prophets,” “Him,” <span id="fr_1997"></span>[1998](#fn_1997.md) that is,
God,—“it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching”—what seemed to the
Greeks foolishness—“to save them that believe. For the Jews require
signs,” in order to faith; “and the Greeks seek after wisdom,” plainly
those reasonings styled “irresistible,” and those others, namely,
syllogisms. “But we preach Jesus Christ crucified; to the Jews a
stumbling-block,” because, though knowing prophecy, they did not believe
the event: “to the Greeks, foolishness;” for those who in their own
estimation are wise, consider it fabulous that the Son of God should
speak by man and that God should have a Son, and especially that that
Son should have suffered. Whence their preconceived idea inclines them
to disbelieve. For the advent of the Saviour did not make people
foolish, and hard of heart, and unbelieving, but made them
understanding, amenable to persuasion, and believing. But those that
would not believe, by separating themselves from the voluntary adherence
of those who obeyed, were proved to be without understanding,
unbelievers and fools. “But to them who are called, both Jews and
Greeks, Christ is the power of God, and the wisdom of God.” Should we
not understand (as is better) the words rendered, “Hath not God made
foolish the wisdom of the world?” negatively: “God hath not made foolish
the wisdom of the world?”—so that the cause of their hardness of heart
may not appear to have proceeded from God, “making foolish the wisdom of
the world.” For on all accounts, being wise, they incur greater blame in
not believing the proclamation. For the preference and choice of truth
is voluntary. But that declaration, “I will destroy the wisdom of the
wise,” declares Him to have sent forth light, by bringing forth in
opposition the despised and contemned barbarian philosophy; as the lamp,
when shone upon by the sun, is said to be extinguished, on account of
its not then exerting <span id="page_321">p. 321</span> <span
id="vi.iv.i.xviii-Page_321"></span>the same power. All having been
therefore called, those who are willing to obey have been named <span
id="fr_1998"></span>[1999](#fn_1998.md) “called.” For there is no
unrighteousness with God. Those of either race who have believed, are “a
peculiar people.” <span id="fr_1999"></span>[2000](#fn_1999.md) And in the
Acts of the Apostles you will find this, word for word, “Those then who
received his word were baptized;” <span
id="fr_2000"></span>[2001](#fn_2000.md) but those who would not obey kept
themselves aloof. To these prophecy says, “If ye be willing and hear me,
ye shall eat the good things of the land;” <span
id="fr_2001"></span>[2002](#fn_2001.md) proving that choice or refusal
depends on ourselves. The apostle designates the doctrine which is
according to the Lord, “the wisdom of God,” in order to show that the
true philosophy has been communicated by the Son. Further, he, who has a
show of wisdom, has certain exhortations enjoined on him by the apostle:
“That ye put on the new man, which after God is renewed in righteousness
and true holiness. Wherefore, putting away lying, speak every man truth.
Neither give place to the devil. Let him that stole, steal no more; but
rather let him labour, working that which is good” (and to work is to
labour in seeking the truth; for it is accompanied with rational
well-doing), “that ye may have to give to him that has need,” <span
id="fr_2002"></span>[2003](#fn_2002.md) both of worldly wealth and of
divine wisdom. For he wishes both that the word be taught, and that the
money be put into the bank, accurately tested, to accumulate interest.
Whence he adds, “Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your
mouth,”—that is “corrupt communication” which proceeds out of
conceit,—“but that which is good for the use of edifying, that it may
minister grace to the hearers.” And the word of the good God must needs
be good. And how is it possible that he who saves shall not be good?
