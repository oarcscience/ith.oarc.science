#### <span id="ii.iii.vii-p0.1"></span>Commandment Seventh.

##### <span id="ii.iii.vii-p0.2"></span>On Fearing God, and Not Fearing the Devil.

<span id="ii.iii.vii-p1"></span>“Fear,” said he, “the Lord, and keep His
commandments. <span id="fr_196"></span>[197](#fn_196.md) For if you keep
the commandments of God, you will be powerful in every action, and every
one of your actions will be incomparable. For, fearing the Lord, you
will do all things well. This is the fear which you ought to have, that
you may be saved. But fear not the devil; for, fearing the Lord, you
will have dominion over the devil, for there is no power in him. But he
in whom there is no power ought on no account to be an object of fear;
but He in whom there is glorious power is truly to be feared. For every
one that has power ought to be feared; but he who has not <span
id="page_25">p. 25</span> <span id="ii.iii.vii-Page_25"></span>power is
despised by all. Fear, therefore, the deeds of the devil, since they are
wicked. For, fearing the Lord, you will not do these deeds, but will
refrain from them. For fears are of two kinds: <span
id="fr_197"></span>[198](#fn_197.md) for if you do not wish to do that
which is evil, fear the Lord, and you will not do it; but, again, if you
wish to do that which is good, fear the Lord, and you will do it.
Wherefore the fear of the Lord is strong, and great, and glorious. Fear,
then, the Lord, and you will live to Him, and as many as fear Him and
keep His commandments will live to God.” “Why,” <span
id="fr_198"></span>[199](#fn_198.md) said I, “sir, did you say in regard to
those that keep His commandments, that they will live to God?”
“Because,” says he, “all creation fears the Lord, but all creation does
not keep His commandments. They only who fear the Lord and keep His
commandments have life with God; <span id="fr_199"></span>[200](#fn_199.md)
but as to those who keep not His commandments, there is no life in
them.”
