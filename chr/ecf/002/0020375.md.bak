<span id="vi.iv.v.i"></span>

##### <span id="vi.iv.v.i-p0.1"></span>Chap. I.—On Faith.

<span id="vi.iv.v.i-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="vi.iv.v.i-p1.1"></span>Of</span> the Gnostic so much has been
cursorily, as it were, written. We proceed now to the sequel, and must
again contemplate faith; for there are some that draw the distinction,
that faith has reference to the Son, and knowledge to the Spirit. But it
has escaped their notice that, in order to believe truly in the Son, we
must believe that He is the Son, and that He came, and how, and for
what, and respecting His passion; and we must know who is the Son of
God. Now neither is knowledge without faith, nor faith without
knowledge. Nor is the Father without the Son; for the Son is with the
Father. And the Son is the true teacher respecting the Father; and that
we may believe in the Son, we must know the Father, with whom also is
the Son. Again, in order that we may know the Father, we must believe in
the Son, that it is the Son of God who teaches; for from faith to
knowledge by the Son is the Father. And the knowledge of the Son and
Father, which is according to the gnostic rule—that which in reality is
gnostic—is the attainment and comprehension of the truth by the truth.

<span id="vi.iv.v.i-p2"></span>We, then, are those who are believers in
what is not believed, and who are Gnostics as to what is unknown; that
is, Gnostics as to what is unknown and disbelieved by all, but believed
and known by a few; and Gnostics, not describing actions by speech, but
Gnostics in the exercise of contemplation. Happy is he who speaks in the
ears of the hearing. Now faith is the ear of the soul. And such the Lord
intimates faith to be, when He says, “He that hath ears to hear, let him
hear;” <span id="fr_2942"></span>[2943](#fn_2942.md) so that by believing
he may comprehend what He says, as He says it. Homer, too, the oldest of
the poets, using the word “hear” instead of “perceive”—the specific for
the generic term—writes:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.i-p3.2"></span> “Him most they heard.” <span
> id="fr_2943"></span>[2944](#fn_2943.md)  

<span id="vi.iv.v.i-p5"></span>For, in fine, the agreement and harmony
of the faith of both <span id="fr_2944"></span>[2945](#fn_2944.md)
contribute to one end—salvation. We have in the apostle an unerring
witness: “For I desire to see you, that I may impart unto you some
spiritual gift, in order that ye may be strengthened; that is, that I
may be comforted in you, by the mutual faith of you and me.” <span
id="fr_2945"></span>[2946](#fn_2945.md) And further on again he adds, “The
righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith.” <span
id="fr_2946"></span>[2947](#fn_2946.md) The apostle, then, manifestly
announces a twofold faith, or rather one which admits of growth and
perfection; for the common faith lies beneath as a foundation. <span
id="fr_2947"></span>[2948](#fn_2947.md) To those, therefore, who desire to
be healed, and are moved by faith, He added, “Thy faith hath saved
thee.” <span id="fr_2948"></span>[2949](#fn_2948.md) But that which is
excellently built upon is consummated in the believer, and is again
perfected by the faith which results from instruction and the word, in
order to the performance of the commandments. Such were the apostles, in
whose case it is said that “faith removed mountains and transplanted
trees.” <span id="fr_2949"></span>[2950](#fn_2949.md) Whence, perceiving
the greatness of its power, they asked “that faith might be added to
them;” <span id="fr_2950"></span>[2951](#fn_2950.md) a faith which
salutarily bites the soil “like a grain of mustard,” and grows
magnificently in it, to such a degree that the reasons of things sublime
rest on it. For if one by nature knows God, as Basilides thinks, who
calls intelligence of a superior order at once faith and kingship, and a
creation worthy of the essence of the Creator; and explains that near
Him exists not power, but essence and nature and substance; and says
that faith is not the rational assent of the soul exercising free-will,
but an undefined beauty, belonging immediately to the creature;—the
precepts both of the Old and of the New Testament are, then,
superfluous, if one is saved by <span id="page_445">p. 445</span> <span
id="vi.iv.v.i-Page_445"></span>nature, as Valentinus would have it, and
is a believer and an elect man by nature, as Basilides thinks; and
nature would have been able, one time or other, to have shone forth,
apart from the Saviour’s appearance. But were they to say that the visit
of the Saviour was necessary, then the properties of nature are gone
from them, the elect being saved by instruction, and purification, and
the doing of good works. Abraham, accordingly, who through hearing
believed the voice, which promised under the oak in Mamre, “I will give
this land to thee, and to thy seed,” was either elect or not. But if he
was not, how did he straightway believe, as it were naturally? And if he
was elect, their hypothesis is done away with, inasmuch as even previous
to the coming of the Lord an election was found, and that saved: “For it
was reckoned to him for righteousness.” <span
id="fr_2951"></span>[2952](#fn_2951.md) For if any one, following Marcion,
should dare to say that the Creator (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.v.i-p13.3"></span>Δημιουργόν</span>) saved the man that
believed on him, even before the advent of the Lord, (the election being
saved with their own proper salvation); the power of the good Being will
be eclipsed; inasmuch as late only, and subsequent to the Creator spoken
of by them in words of good omen, it made the attempt to save, and by
instruction, and in imitation of him. But if, being such, the good Being
save, according to them; neither is it his own that he saves, nor is it
with the consent of him who formed the creation that he essays
salvation, but by force or fraud. And how can he any more be good,
acting thus, and being posterior? But if the locality is different, and
the dwelling-place of the Omnipotent is remote from the dwelling-place
of the good God; yet the will of him who saves, having been the first to
begin, is not inferior to that of the good God. From what has been
previously proved, those who believe not are proved senseless: “For
their paths are perverted, and they know not peace,” saith the
prophet. <span id="fr_2952"></span>[2953](#fn_2952.md) “But foolish and
unlearned questions” the divine Paul exhorted to “avoid, because they
gender strifes.” <span id="fr_2953"></span>[2954](#fn_2953.md) And Æschylus
exclaims:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.i-p15.2"></span> “In what profits not, labour not in
> vain.”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.i-p16"></span>For that investigation, which accords
with faith, which builds, on the foundation of faith, <span
id="fr_2954"></span>[2955](#fn_2954.md) the august knowledge of the truth,
we know to be the best. Now we know that neither things which are clear
are made subjects of investigation, such as if it is day, while it is
day; nor things unknown, and never destined to become clear, as whether
the stars are even or odd in number; nor things convertible; and those
are so which can be said equally by those who take the opposite side, as
if what is in the womb is a living creature or not. A fourth mode is,
when, from either side of those, there is advanced an unanswerable and
irrefragable argument. If, then, the ground of inquiry, according to all
of these modes, is removed, faith is established. For we advance to them
the unanswerable consideration, that it is God who speaks and comes to
our help in writing, respecting each one of the points regarding which I
investigate. Who, then, is so impious as to disbelieve God, and to
demand proofs from God as from men? Again, some questions demand the
evidence of the senses, <span id="fr_2955"></span>[2956](#fn_2955.md) as if
one were to ask whether the fire be warm, or the snow white; and some
admonition and rebuke, as the question if you ought to honour your
parents. And there are those that deserve punishment, as to ask proofs
of the existence of Providence. There being then a Providence, it were
impious to think that the whole of prophecy and the economy in reference
to a Saviour did not take place in accordance with Providence. And
perchance one should not even attempt to demonstrate such points, the
divine Providence being evident from the sight of all its skilful and
wise works which are seen, some of which take place in order, and some
appear in order. And He who communicated to us being and life, has
communicated to us also reason, wishing us to live rationally and
rightly. For the Word of the Father of the universe is not the uttered
word (<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.iv.v.i-p18.1"></span>λόγος
προφορικός</span>), but the wisdom and most manifest kindness of God,
and His power too, which is almighty and truly divine, and not incapable
of being conceived by those who do not confess—the all-potent will. But
since some are unbelieving, and some are disputatious, all do not attain
to the perfection of the good. For neither is it possible to attain it
without the exercise of free choice; nor does the whole depend on our
own purpose; as, for example, what is defined to happen. “For by grace
we are saved:” not, indeed, without good works; but we must, by being
formed for what is good, acquire an inclination for it. And we must
possess the healthy mind which is fixed on the pursuit of the good; in
order to which we have the greatest need of divine grace, and of right
teaching, and of holy susceptibility, and of the drawing of the Father
to Him. For, bound in this earthly body, we apprehend the objects of
sense by means of the body; but we grasp intellectual objects by means
of the logical faculty itself. But if one expect to apprehend all things
by the senses, he has fallen far from the truth. Spiritually, therefore,
the apostle writes respecting the knowledge of God, <span
id="page_446">p. 446</span> <span id="vi.iv.v.i-Page_446"></span>“For
now we see as through a glass, but then face to face.” <span
id="fr_2956"></span>[2957](#fn_2956.md) For the vision of the truth is
given but to few. Accordingly, Plato says in the *Epinomis*, “I do not
say that it is possible for all to be blessed and happy; only a few.
Whilst we live, I pronounce this to be the case. But there is a good
hope that after death I shall attain all.” To the same effect is what we
find in Moses: “No man shall see My face, and live.” <span
id="fr_2957"></span>[2958](#fn_2957.md) For it is evident that no one
during the period of life has been able to apprehend God clearly. But
“the pure in heart shall see God,” <span
id="fr_2958"></span>[2959](#fn_2958.md) when they arrive at the final
perfection. For since the soul became too enfeebled for the apprehension
of realities, we needed a divine teacher. The Saviour is sent down—a
teacher and leader in the acquisition of the good—the secret and sacred
token of the great Providence. “Where, then, is the scribe? where is the
searcher of this world? Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this
world?” <span id="fr_2959"></span>[2960](#fn_2959.md) it is said. And
again, “I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and bring to nothing the
understanding of the prudent,” <span
id="fr_2960"></span>[2961](#fn_2960.md) plainly of those wise in their own
eyes, and disputatious. Excellently therefore Jeremiah says, “Thus saith
the <span class="sc"><span id="vi.iv.v.i-p23.2"></span>Lord</span>,
Stand in the ways, and ask for the eternal paths, what is the good way,
and walk in it, and ye shall find expiation for your souls.” <span
id="fr_2961"></span>[2962](#fn_2961.md) Ask, he says, and inquire of those
who know, without contention and dispute. And on learning the way of
truth, let us walk on the right way, without turning till we attain to
what we desire. It was therefore with reason that the king of the Romans
(his name was Numa), being a Pythagorean, first of all men, erected a
temple to Faith and Peace. “And to Abraham, on believing, righteousness
was reckoned.” <span id="fr_2962"></span>[2963](#fn_2962.md) He,
prosecuting the lofty philosophy of aerial phenomena, and the sublime
philosophy of the movements in the heavens, was called Abram, which is
interpreted “sublime father.” <span id="fr_2963"></span>[2964](#fn_2963.md)
But afterwards, on looking up to heaven, whether it was that he saw the
Son in the spirit, as some explain, or a glorious angel, or in any other
way recognised God to be superior to the creation, and all the order in
it, he receives in addition the Alpha, the knowledge of the one and only
God, and is called Abraam, having, instead of a natural philosopher,
become wise, and a lover of God. For it is interpreted, “elect father of
sound.” For by sound is the uttered word: the mind is its father; and
the mind of the good man is elect. I cannot forbear praising exceedingly
the poet of Agrigentum, who celebrates faith as follows:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.i-p26.3"></span> “Friends, I know, then, that there
> is truth in the myths  
> Which I will relate. But very difficult to men,  
> And irksome to the mind, is the attempt of faith.” <span
> id="fr_2964"></span>[2965](#fn_2964.md)  

<span id="vi.iv.v.i-p28"></span>Wherefore also the apostle exhorts,
“that your faith should not be in the wisdom of men,” who profess to
persuade, “but in the power of God,” <span
id="fr_2965"></span>[2966](#fn_2965.md) which alone without proofs, by mere
faith, is able to save. “For the most approved of those that are
reputable knows how to keep watch. And justice will apprehend the
forgers and witnesses of lies,” says the Ephesian. <span
id="fr_2966"></span>[2967](#fn_2966.md) For he, having derived his
knowledge from the barbarian philosophy, is acquainted with the
purification by fire of those who have led bad lives, which the Stoics
afterwards called the Conflagration (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.v.i-p30.1"></span>ἐκπύρωσις</span>), in which also they teach
that each will arise exactly as he was, so treating of the resurrection;
while Plato says as follows, that the earth at certain periods is
purified by fire and water: “There have been many destructions of men in
many ways; and there shall be very great ones by fire and water; and
others briefer by innumerable causes.” And after a little he adds: “And,
in truth, there is a change of the objects which revolve about earth and
heaven; and in the course of long periods there is the destruction of
the objects on earth by a great conflagration.” Then he subjoins
respecting the deluge: “But when, again, the gods deluge the earth to
purify it with water, those on the mountains, herdsmen and shepherds,
are saved; those in your cities are carried down by the rivers into the
sea.” And we showed in the first Miscellany <span
id="fr_2967"></span>[2968](#fn_2967.md) that the philosophers of the Greeks
are called thieves, inasmuch as they have taken without acknowledgment
their principal dogmas from Moses and the prophets. To which also we
shall add, that the angels who had obtained the superior rank, having
sunk into pleasures, told to the women <span
id="fr_2968"></span>[2969](#fn_2968.md) the secrets which had come to their
knowledge; while the rest of the angels concealed them, or rather, kept
them against the coming of the Lord. Thence emanated the doctrine of
providence, and the revelation of high things; and prophecy having
already been imparted to the philosophers of the Greeks, the treatment
of dogma arose among the philosophers, sometimes true when they hit the
mark, and sometimes erroneous, when they comprehended not the secret of
the prophetic allegory. And this it is proposed briefly to indicate in
running over the points requiring mention. Faith, then, we say, we are
to show must not be <span id="page_447">p. 447</span> <span
id="vi.iv.v.i-Page_447"></span>inert and alone, but accompanied with
investigation. For I do not say that we are not to inquire at all. For
“Search, and thou shalt find,” <span
id="fr_2969"></span>[2970](#fn_2969.md) it is said.

> <span id="vi.iv.v.i-p33.2"></span> “What is sought may be captured,  
> But what is neglected escapes,”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.i-p34"></span>according to Sophocles.

<span id="vi.iv.v.i-p35"></span>The like also says Menander the comic
poet:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.i-p35.1"></span> “All things sought,  
> The wisest say, need anxious thought.  

<span id="vi.iv.v.i-p36"></span>But we ought to direct the visual
faculty of the soul aright to discovery, and to clear away obstacles;
and to cast clean away contention, and envy, and strife, destined to
perish miserably from among men.

<span id="vi.iv.v.i-p37"></span>For very beautifully does Timon of
Phlius write:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.i-p37.1"></span> “And Strife, the Plague of Mortals,
> stalks vainly shrieking,  
> The sister of Murderous Quarrel and Discord,  
> Which rolls blindly over all things. But then  
> It sets its head towards men, and casts them on hope.”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.i-p38"></span>Then a little below he adds:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.i-p38.1"></span> “For who hath set these to fight in
> deadly strife?  
> A rabble keeping pace with Echo; for, enraged at those silent,  
> It raised an evil disease against men, and many perished;”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.i-p39"></span>of the speech which denies what is
false, and of the dilemma, of that which is concealed, of the Sorites,
and of the Crocodilean, of that which is open, and of ambiguities and
sophisms. To inquire, then, respecting God, if it tend not to strife,
but to discovery, is salutary. For it is written in David, “The poor
eat, and shall be filled; and they shall praise the Lord that seek Him.
Your heart shall live for ever.” <span
id="fr_2970"></span>[2971](#fn_2970.md) For they who seek Him after the
true search, praising the Lord, shall be filled with the gift that comes
from God, that is, knowledge. And their soul shall live; for the soul is
figuratively termed the heart, which ministers life: for by the Son is
the Father known.

<span id="vi.iv.v.i-p41"></span>We ought not to surrender our ears to
all who speak and write rashly. For cups also, which are taken hold of
by many by the ears, are dirtied, and lose the ears; and besides, when
they fall they are broken. In the same way also, those, who have
polluted the pure hearing of faith by many trifles, at last becoming
deaf to the truth, become useless and fall to the earth. It is not,
then, without reason that we commanded boys to kiss their relations,
holding them by the ears; indicating this, that the feeling of love is
engendered by hearing. And “God,” who is known to those who love, “is
love,” <span id="fr_2971"></span>[2972](#fn_2971.md) as “God,” who by
instruction is communicated to the faithful, “is faithful;” <span
id="fr_2972"></span>[2973](#fn_2972.md) and we must be allied to Him by
divine love: so that by like we may see like, hearing the word of truth
guilelessly and purely, as children who obey us. And this was what he,
whoever he was, indicated who wrote on the entrance to the temple at
Epidaurus the inscription:—

> <span id="vi.iv.v.i-p43.2"></span> “Pure he must be who goes within  
> The incense-perfumed fane.”  

<span id="vi.iv.v.i-p44"></span>And purity is “to think holy thoughts.”
“Except ye become as these little children, ye shall not enter,” it is
said, “into the kingdom of heaven.” <span
id="fr_2973"></span>[2974](#fn_2973.md) For there the temple of God is seen
established on three foundations—faith, hope, and love.
