<span id="vi.iv.i.x"></span>

##### <span id="vi.iv.i.x-p0.1"></span>Chapter X.—To Act Well of Greater Consequence Than to Speak Well.

<span id="vi.iv.i.x-p1"></span>Wherefore the Saviour, taking the bread,
first spake and blessed. Then breaking the bread, <span
id="fr_1896"></span>[1897](#fn_1896) He presented it, that we might eat
it, according to reason, and that knowing the Scriptures <span
id="fr_1897"></span>[1898](#fn_1897) we might walk obediently. And as
those whose speech is evil are no better than those whose practice is
evil (for calumny is the servant of the sword, and evil-speaking
inflicts pain; and from these proceed disasters in life, such being the
effects of evil speech); so also those who are given to good speech are
near neighbours to those who accomplish good deeds. Accordingly
discourse refreshes the soul and entices it to nobleness; and happy is
he who has the use of both his hands. Neither, therefore, is he who can
act well to be vilified by him who is able to speak well; nor is he who
is able to speak well to be disparaged by him who is capable of acting
well. But let each do that for which he is naturally fitted. What the
one exhibits as actually done, the other speaks, preparing, as it were,
the way for well-doing, and leading the hearers to the practice of good.
For there is a saving word, as there is a saving work. Righteousness,
accordingly, <span id="fr_1898"></span>[1899](#fn_1898) is not
constituted without discourse. And as the receiving of good is abolished
if we abolish the doing of good; so obedience and faith are abolished
when neither the command, nor one to expound the command, is taken along
with us. <span id="fr_1899"></span>[1900](#fn_1899) But now we are
benefited mutually and reciprocally by words and deeds; but we must
repudiate entirely the art of wrangling and sophistry, since these
sentences of the sophists not only bewitch and beguile the many, but
sometimes by violence win a Cadmean victory. <span
id="fr_1900"></span>[1901](#fn_1900) For true above all is that Psalm,
“The just shall live to the end, for he shall not see corruption, when
he beholds the wise dying.” <span id="fr_1901"></span>[1902](#fn_1901)
And whom does he call wise? Hear from the Wisdom of Jesus: “Wisdom is
not the knowledge of evil.” <span id="fr_1902"></span>[1903](#fn_1902)
Such he calls what the arts of speaking and of discussing have invented.
“Thou shalt therefore seek wisdom among the wicked, and shalt not find
it.” <span id="fr_1903"></span>[1904](#fn_1903) And if you inquire again
of what sort this is, you are told, “The mouth of the righteous man will
distil wisdom.” <span id="fr_1904"></span>[1905](#fn_1904) And similarly
<span id="page_311">p. 311</span> <span
id="vi.iv.i.x-Page_311"></span>with truth, the art of sophistry is
called wisdom.

<span id="vi.iv.i.x-p11"></span>But it is my purpose, as I reckon, and
not without reason, to live according to the Word, and to understand
what is revealed; <span id="fr_1905"></span>[1906](#fn_1905) but never
affecting eloquence, to be content merely with indicating my meaning.
And by what term that which I wish to present is shown, I care not. For
I well know that to be saved, and to aid those who desire to be saved,
is the best thing, and not to compose paltry sentences like gewgaws.
“And if,” says the Pythagorean in the *Politicus* of Plato, “you guard
against solicitude about terms, you will be richer in wisdom against old
age.” <span id="fr_1906"></span>[1907](#fn_1906) And in the *Theœtetus*
you will find again, “And carelessness about names, and expressions, and
the want of nice scrutiny, is not vulgar and illiberal for the most
part, but rather the reverse of this, and is sometimes necessary.” <span
id="fr_1907"></span>[1908](#fn_1907) This the Scripture <span
id="fr_1908"></span>[1909](#fn_1908) has expressed with the greatest
possible brevity, when it said, “Be not occupied much about words.” For
expression is like the dress on the body. The matter is the flesh and
sinews. We must not therefore care more for the dress than the safety of
the body. For not only a simple mode of life, but also a style of speech
devoid of superfluity and nicety, must be cultivated by him who has
adopted the true life, if we are to abandon luxury as treacherous and
profligate, as the ancient Lacedæmonians adjured ointment and purple,
deeming and calling them rightly treacherous garments and treacherous
unguents; since neither is that mode of preparing food right where there
is more of seasoning than of nutriment; nor is that style of speech
elegant which can please rather than benefit the hearers. Pythagoras
exhorts us to consider the Muses more pleasant than the Sirens, teaching
us to cultivate wisdom apart from pleasure, and exposing the other mode
of attracting the soul as deceptive. For sailing past the Sirens one man
has sufficient strength, and for answering the Sphinx another one, or,
if you please, not even one. <span id="fr_1909"></span>[1910](#fn_1909)
We ought never, then, out of desire for vainglory, to make broad the
phylacteries. It suffices the gnostic <span
id="fr_1910"></span>[1911](#fn_1910) if only one hearer is found for
him. <span id="fr_1911"></span>[1912](#fn_1911) You may hear therefore
Pindar the Bœotian, <span id="fr_1912"></span>[1913](#fn_1912) who
writes, “Divulge not before all the ancient speech. The way of silence
is sometimes the surest. And the mightiest word is a spur to the fight.”
Accordingly, the blessed apostle very appropriately and urgently exhorts
us “not to strive about words to no profit, but to the subverting of the
hearers, but to shun profane and vain babblings, for they increase unto
more ungodliness, and their word will eat as doth a canker.” <span
id="fr_1913"></span>[1914](#fn_1913)
