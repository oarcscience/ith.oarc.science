##### <span id="iii.ii.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.—Christians’ Belief in the Resurrection.

<span id="iii.ii.vi-p1"></span>And on this account we believe that there
will be a resurrection of bodies after the consummation of all things;
not, as the Stoics affirm, according to the return of certain cycles,
the same things being produced and destroyed for no useful purpose, but
a resurrection once for all, <span id="fr_437"></span>[438](#fn_437.md)
when our periods of existence are completed, and in consequence solely
of the constitution of things under which men alone live, for the
purpose of passing judgment upon them. Nor is sentence upon us passed by
Minos or Rhadamanthus, before whose decease not a single soul, according
to the mythic tales, was judged; but the Creator, God Himself, becomes
the arbiter. And, although you regard us as mere triflers and babblers,
it troubles us not, since we have faith in this doctrine. For just as,
not existing before I was born, I knew not who I was, and only existed
in the potentiality (<span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.ii.vi-p2.3"></span>ὐπόστασις</span>) of fleshly matter, but
being born, after a former state of nothingness, I have obtained through
my birth a certainty of my existence; in the same way, having been born,
and through death existing no longer, and seen no longer, I shall exist
again, just as before I was not, but was afterwards born. Even though
fire destroy all traces of my flesh, the world receives the vaporized
matter; <span id="fr_438"></span>[439](#fn_438.md) and though dispersed
through rivers and seas, or torn in pieces by wild beasts, I am laid up
in the storehouses of a wealthy Lord. And, although the poor and the
godless know not what is stored up, yet God the Sovereign, when He
pleases, will restore the substance that is visible to Him alone to its
pristine condition.
