##### <span id="iv.ii.iii.xviii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.—Errors of the Greeks About the Deluge.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.xviii-p1"></span>For Plato, as we said above, when
he had demonstrated that a deluge had happened, said that it extended
not over the whole earth, but only over the plains, and that those who
fled to the highest hills saved themselves. But others say that there
existed Deucalion and Pyrrha, and that they were preserved in a chest;
and that Deucalion, after he came out of the chest, flung stones behind
him, and that men were produced from the stones; from which circumstance
they say that men in the mass are named “people.” <span
id="fr_675"></span>[676](#fn_675.md) Others, again, say that Clymenus
existed in a second flood. From what has already been said, it is
evident that they who wrote such things and philosophized to so little
purpose are miserable, and very profane and senseless persons. But
Moses, our prophet and the servant of God, in giving an account of the
genesis of the world, related in what manner the flood came upon the
earth, telling us, besides, how the details of the flood came about, and
relating no fable of Pyrrha nor of Deucalion or Clymenus; nor, forsooth,
that only the plains were submerged, and that those only who escaped to
the mountains were saved.
