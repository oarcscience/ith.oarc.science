<span id="vi.iv.iv.xxi"></span>

##### <span id="vi.iv.iv.xxi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXIII.—The Same Subject Continued.

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xxi-p1"></span>For it is not suitable to the nature
of the thing itself, that they should apprehend in the truly gnostic
manner the truth, that all things which were created for our use are
good; as, for example, marriage and procreation, when used in
moderation; and that it is better than good to become free of passion,
and virtuous by assimilation to the divine. But in the case of external
things, agreeable or disagreeable, from some they abstain, from others
not. But in those things from which they abstain from disgust, they
plainly find fault with the creature and the Creator; and though in
appearance they walk faithfully, the opinion they maintain is impious.
That command, “Thou shall not lust,” needs neither the necessity arising
from fear, which compels to keep from things that are pleasant; nor the
reward, which by promise persuades to restrain the impulses of passion.

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xxi-p2"></span>And those who obey God through the
promise, caught by the bait of pleasure, choose obedience not for the
sake of the commandment, but for the sake of the promise. Nor will
turning away from objects of sense, as a matter of necessary
consequence, produce attachment to intellectual objects. On the
contrary, the attachment to intellectual objects naturally becomes to
the Gnostic an influence which draws away from the objects of sense;
inasmuch as he, in virtue of the selection of what is good, has chosen
what is good according to knowledge (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.iv.xxi-p2.1"></span>γνωστικῶς</span>), admiring generation,
and by sanctifying the Creator sanctifying assimilation to the divine.
But I shall free myself from lust, let him say, O Lord, for the sake of
alliance with Thee. For the economy of creation is good, and all things
are well administered: nothing happens without a cause. I must be in
what is Thine, O Omnipotent One. And if I am there, I am near Thee. And
I would be free of fear that I may be able to draw near to Thee, and to
be satisfied with little, practising Thy just choice between things good
and things like.

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xxi-p3"></span>Right mystically and sacredly the
apostle, teaching us the choice which is truly gracious, <span
id="page_437">p. 437</span> <span id="vi.iv.iv.xxi-Page_437"></span>not
in the way of rejection of other things as bad, but so as to do things
better than what is good, has spoken, saying, “So he that giveth his
virgin in marriage doeth well; and he that giveth her not doeth better;
as far as respects seemliness and undistracted attendance on the
Lord.” <span id="fr_2898"></span>[2899](#fn_2898.md)

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xxi-p5"></span>Now we know that things which are
difficult are not essential; but that things which are essential have
been graciously made easy of attainment by God. Wherefore Democritus
well says, that “nature and instruction” are like each other. And we
have briefly assigned the cause. For instruction harmonizes man, and by
harmonizing makes him natural; and it is no matter whether one was made
such as he is by nature, or transformed by time and education. The Lord
has furnished both; that which is by creation, and that which is by
creating again and renewal through the covenant. And that is preferable
which is advantageous to what is superior; but what is superior to
everything is mind. So, then, what is really good is seen to be most
pleasant, and of itself produces the fruit which is desired—tranquillity
of soul. “And he who hears Me,” it is said, “shall rest in peace,
confident, and shall be calm without fear of any evil.” <span
id="fr_2899"></span>[2900](#fn_2899.md) “Rely with all thy heart and thy
mind on God.” <span id="fr_2900"></span>[2901](#fn_2900.md)

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xxi-p8"></span>On this wise it is possible for the
Gnostic already to have become God. “I said, Ye are gods, and <span
id="fr_2901"></span>[2902](#fn_2901.md) sons of the highest.” And
Empedocles says that the souls of the wise become gods, writing as
follows:—

> <span id="vi.iv.iv.xxi-p9.2"></span> “At last prophets, minstrels, and
> physicians,  
> And the foremost among mortal men, approach;  
> Whence spring gods supreme in honours.”  

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xxi-p10"></span>Man, then, genetically considered, is
formed in accordance with the idea of the connate spirit. For he is not
created formless and shapeless in the workshop of nature, where
mystically the production of man is accomplished, both art and essence
being common. But the individual man is stamped according to the
impression produced in the soul by the objects of his choice. Thus we
say that Adam was perfect, as far as respects his formation; for none of
the distinctive characteristics of the idea and form of man were wanting
to him; but in the act of coming into being he received perfection. And
he was justified by obedience; this was reaching manhood, as far as
depended on him. And the cause lay in his choosing, and especially in
his choosing what was forbidden. God was not the cause.

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xxi-p11"></span>For production is twofold—of things
procreated, and of things that grow. And manliness in man, who is
subject to perturbation, as they say, makes him who partakes of it
essentially fearless and invincible; and anger is the mind’s satellite
in patience, and endurance, and the like; and self-constraint and
salutary sense are set over desire. But God is impassible, free of
anger, destitute of desire. And He is not free of fear, in the sense of
avoiding what is terrible; or temperate, in the sense of having command
of desires. For neither can the nature of God fall in with anything
terrible, nor does God flee fear; just as He will not feel desire, so as
to rule over desires. Accordingly that Pythagorean saying was mystically
uttered respecting us, “that man ought to become one;” for the high
priest himself is one, God being one in the immutable state of the
perpetual flow <span id="fr_2902"></span>[2903](#fn_2902.md) of good
things. Now the Saviour has taken away wrath in and with lust, wrath
being lust of vengeance. For universally liability to feeling belongs to
every kind of desire; and man, when deified purely into a passionless
state, becomes a unit. As, then, those, who at sea are held by an
anchor, pull at the anchor, but do not drag it to them, but drag
themselves to the anchor; so those who, according to the gnostic life,
draw God towards them, imperceptibly bring themselves to God: for he who
reverences God, reverences himself. In the contemplative life, then, one
in worshipping God attends to himself, and through his own spotless
purification beholds the holy God holily; for self-control, being
present, surveying and contemplating itself uninterruptedly, is as far
as possible assimilated to God.

##### <span id="vi.iv.iv.xxi-p12.3"></span>Chapter XXIV.—The Reason and End of Divine Punishments.

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xxi-p13"></span>Now that is in our power, of which
equally with its opposite we are masters,—as, say to philosophize or
not, to believe or disbelieve. In consequence, then, of our being
equally masters of each of the opposites, what depends on us is found
possible. Now the commandments may be done or not done by us, who, as is
reasonable, are liable to praise and blame. And those, again, who are
punished on account of sins committed by them, are punished for them
alone; for what is done is past, and what is done can never be undone.
The sins committed before faith are accordingly forgiven by the Lord,
not that they may be undone, but as if they had not been done. “But not
all,” says Basilides, <span id="fr_2903"></span>[2904](#fn_2903.md) “but
only sins involuntary and in ignorance, are forgiven;” as would be the
case were it a man, and not God, that conferred such a boon. To such an
one Scripture says, “Thou thoughtest that I would be like thee.” <span
id="fr_2904"></span>[2905](#fn_2904.md) But if we are punished <span
id="page_438">p. 438</span> <span id="vi.iv.iv.xxi-Page_438"></span>for
voluntary sins, we are punished not that the sins which are done may be
undone, but because they were done. But punishment does not avail to him
who has sinned, to undo his sin, but that he may sin no more, and that
no one else fall into the like. Therefore the good God corrects for
these three causes: First, that he who is corrected may become better
than his former self; then that those who are capable of being saved by
examples may be driven back, being admonished; and thirdly, that he who
is injured may not be readily despised, and be apt to receive injury.
And there are two methods of correction—the instructive and the
punitive, which we have called the disciplinary. It ought to be known,
then, that those who fall into sin after baptism <span
id="fr_2905"></span>[2906](#fn_2905.md) are those who are subjected to
discipline; for the deeds done before are remitted, and those done after
are purged. It is in reference to the unbelieving that it is said, “that
they are reckoned as the chaff which the wind drives from the face of
the earth, and the drop which falls from a vessel.” <span
id="fr_2906"></span>[2907](#fn_2906.md)

##### <span id="vi.iv.iv.xxi-p17.3"></span>Chapter XXV.—True Perfection Consists in the Knowledge and Love of God.

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xxi-p18"></span>“Happy he who possesses the culture
of knowledge, and is not moved to the injury of the citizens or to wrong
actions, but contemplates the undecaying order of immortal nature, how
and in what way and manner it subsists. To such the practice of base
deeds attaches not,” Rightly, then, Plato says, “that the man who
devotes himself to the contemplation of ideas will live as a god among
men; now the mind is the place of ideas, and God is mind.” He says that
he who contemplates the unseen God lives as a god among men. And in the
*Sophist*, Socrates calls the stranger of Elea, who was a dialectician,
“god:” “Such are the gods who, like stranger guests, frequent cities.
For when the soul, rising above the sphere of generation, is by itself
apart, and dwells amidst ideas,” like the Coryphæus in Theætetus, now
become as an angel, it will be with Christ, being rapt in contemplation,
ever keeping in view the will of God; in reality

> <span id="vi.iv.iv.xxi-p18.1"></span> “Alone wise, while these flit
> like shadows.” <span id="fr_2907"></span>[2908](#fn_2907.md)  

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xxi-p20"></span>“For the dead bury their dead.”
Whence Jeremiah says: “I will fill it with the earth-born dead whom mine
anger has smitten.” <span id="fr_2908"></span>[2909](#fn_2908.md)

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xxi-p22"></span>God, then, being not a subject for
demonstration, cannot be the object of science. But the Son is wisdom,
and knowledge, and truth, and all else that has affinity thereto. He is
also susceptible of demonstration and of description. And all the powers
of the Spirit, becoming collectively one thing, terminate in the same
point—that is, in the Son. But He is incapable of being declared, in
respect of the idea of each one of His powers. And the Son is neither
simply one thing as one thing, nor many things as parts, but one thing
as all things; whence also He is all things. For He is the circle of all
powers rolled and united into one unity. Wherefore the Word is called
the Alpha and the Omega, of whom alone the end becomes beginning, and
ends again at the original beginning without any break. Wherefore also
to believe in Him, and by Him, is to become a unit, being indissolubly
united in Him; and to disbelieve is to be separated, disjoined, divided.

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xxi-p23"></span>“Wherefore thus saith the Lord, Every
alien son is uncircumcised in heart, and uncircumcised in flesh” (that
is, unclean in body and soul): “there shall not enter one of the
strangers into the midst of the house of Israel, but the Levites.” <span
id="fr_2909"></span>[2910](#fn_2909.md) He calls those that would not
believe, but would disbelieve, strangers. Only those who live purely
being true priests of God. Wherefore, of all the circumcised tribes,
those anointed to be high priests, and kings, and prophets, were
reckoned more holy. Whence He commands them not to touch dead bodies, or
approach the dead; not that the body was polluted, but that sin and
disobedience were incarnate, and embodied, and dead, and therefore
abominable. It was only, then, when a father and mother, a son and
daughter died, that the priest was allowed to enter, because these were
related only by flesh and seed, to whom the priest was indebted for the
immediate cause of his entrance into life. And they purify themselves
seven days, the period in which Creation was consummated. For on the
seventh day the rest is celebrated; and on the eighth he brings a
propitiation, as is written in Ezekiel, according to which propitiation
the promise is to be received. <span
id="fr_2910"></span>[2911](#fn_2910.md) And the perfect propitiation, I
take it, is that propitious faith in the Gospel which is by the law and
the prophets, and the purity which shows itself in universal obedience,
with the abandonment of the things of the world; in order to that
grateful surrender of the tabernacle, which results from the enjoyment
of the soul. Whether, then, the time be that which through the seven
periods enumerated returns to the chiefest rest, <span
id="fr_2911"></span>[2912](#fn_2911.md) or the seven heavens, which some
reckon one above the other; or whether also the fixed sphere which
borders on the intellectual world be called the eighth, the expression
denotes that the Gnostic ought to rise out of the sphere of creation and
of sin. After these seven days, sacrifices are offered for sins. For
there is still fear of <span id="page_439">p. 439</span> <span
id="vi.iv.iv.xxi-Page_439"></span>change, and it touches the seventh
circle. The righteous Job says: “Naked came I out of my mother’s womb,
and naked shall I return there;” <span
id="fr_2912"></span>[2913](#fn_2912.md) not naked of possessions, for that
were a trivial and common thing; but, as a just man, he departs naked of
evil and sin, and of the unsightly shape which follows those who have
led bad lives. For this was what was said, “Unless ye be converted, and
become as children,” <span id="fr_2913"></span>[2914](#fn_2913.md) pure in
flesh, holy in soul by abstinence from evil deeds; showing that He would
have us to be such as also He generated us from our mother—the
water. <span id="fr_2914"></span>[2915](#fn_2914.md) For the intent of one
generation succeeding another is to immortalize by progress. “But the
lamp of the wicked shall be put out.” <span
id="fr_2915"></span>[2916](#fn_2915.md) That purity in body and soul which
the Gnostic partakes of, the all-wise Moses indicated, by employing
repetition in describing the incorruptibility of body and of soul in the
person of Rebecca, thus: “Now the virgin was fair, and man had not known
her.” <span id="fr_2916"></span>[2917](#fn_2916.md) And Rebecca,
interpreted, means “glory of God;” and the glory of God is
immortality. <span id="fr_2917"></span>[2918](#fn_2917.md) This is in
reality righteousness, not to desire other things, but to be entirely
the consecrated temple of the Lord. Righteousness is peace of life and a
well-conditioned state, to which the Lord dismissed her when He said,
“Depart into peace.” <span id="fr_2918"></span>[2919](#fn_2918.md) For
Salem is, by interpretation, peace; of which our Saviour is enrolled
King, as Moses says, Melchizedek king of Salem, priest of the most high
God, who gave bread and wine, furnishing consecrated food for a type of
the Eucharist. And Melchizedek is interpreted “righteous king;” and the
name is a synonym for righteousness and peace. Basilides, however,
supposes that Righteousness and her daughter Peace dwell stationed in
the eighth sphere.

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xxi-p34"></span>But we must pass from physics to
ethics, which are clearer; for the discourse concerning these will
follow after the treatise in hand. The Saviour Himself, then, plainly
initiates us into the mysteries, according to the words of the
tragedy: <span id="fr_2919"></span>[2920](#fn_2919.md) —

> <span id="vi.iv.iv.xxi-p35.1"></span> “Seeing those who see, he also
> gives the orgies.”  

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xxi-p36"></span>And if you ask,

> <span id="vi.iv.iv.xxi-p36.1"></span> “These orgies, what is their
> nature?”  

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xxi-p37"></span>You will hear again:—

> <span id="vi.iv.iv.xxi-p37.1"></span> “It is forbidden to mortals
> uninitiated in the Bacchic rites to know.”  

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xxi-p38"></span>And if any one will inquire curiously
what they are, let him hear:—

> <span id="vi.iv.iv.xxi-p38.1"></span> “It is not lawful for thee to
> hear, but they are worth knowing;  
> The rites of the God detest him who practices impiety.”  

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xxi-p39"></span>Now God, who is without beginning, is
the perfect beginning of the universe, and the producer of the
beginning. As, then, He is being, He is the first principle of the
department of action, as He is good, of morals; as He is mind, on the
other hand, He is the first principle of reasoning and of judgment.
Whence also He alone is Teacher, who is the only Son of the Most High
Father, the Instructor of men.

##### <span id="vi.iv.iv.xxi-p39.1"></span>Chapter XXVI.—How the Perfect Man Treats the Body and the Things of the World.

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xxi-p40"></span>Those, then, who run down created
existence and vilify the body are wrong; not considering that the frame
of man was formed erect for the contemplation of heaven, and that the
organization of the senses tends to knowledge; and that the members and
parts are arranged for good, not for pleasure. Whence this abode becomes
receptive of the soul which is most precious to God; and is dignified
with the Holy Spirit through the sanctification of soul and body,
perfected with the perfection of the Saviour. And the succession of the
three virtues is found in the Gnostic, who morally, physically, and
logically occupies himself with God. For wisdom is the knowledge of
things divine and human; and righteousness is the concord of the parts
of the soul; and holiness is the service of God. But if one were to say
that he disparaged the flesh, and generation on account of it, by
quoting Isaiah, who says, “All flesh is grass, and all the glory of man
as the flower of grass: the grass is withered, and the flower has
fallen; but the word of the Lord endureth for ever;” <span
id="fr_2920"></span>[2921](#fn_2920.md) let him hear the Spirit
interpreting the matter in question by Jeremiah, “And I scattered them
like dry sticks, that are made to fly by the wind into the desert. This
is the lot and portion of your disobedience, saith the <span
class="sc"><span id="vi.iv.iv.xxi-p41.2"></span>Lord</span>. As thou
hast forgotten Me, and hast trusted in lies, so will I discover thy
hinder parts to thy face; and thy disgrace shall be seen, thy adultery,
and thy neighing,” and so on. <span id="fr_2921"></span>[2922](#fn_2921.md)
For “the flower of grass,” and “walking after the flesh,” and “being
carnal,” according to the apostle, are those who are in their sins. The
soul of man is confessedly the better part of man, and the body the
inferior. But neither is the soul good by nature, nor, on the other
hand, is the body bad by nature. Nor is that which is not good
straightway bad. For there are things which occupy a middle place, and
among them are things to be preferred, and things to be rejected. <span
id="page_440">p. 440</span> <span id="vi.iv.iv.xxi-Page_440"></span>The
constitution of man, then, which has its place among things of sense,
was necessarily composed of things diverse, but not opposite—body and
soul.

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xxi-p43"></span>Always therefore the good actions, as
better, attach to the better and ruling spirit; and voluptuous and
sinful actions are attributed to the worse, the sinful one.

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xxi-p44"></span>Now the soul of the wise man and
Gnostic, as sojourning in the body, conducts itself towards it gravely
and respectfully, not with inordinate affections, as about to leave the
tabernacle if the time of departure summon. “I am a stranger in the
earth, and a sojourner with you,” it is said. <span
id="fr_2922"></span>[2923](#fn_2922.md) And hence Basilides says, that he
apprehends that the election are strangers to the world, being
supramundane by nature. But this is not the case. For all things are of
one God. And no one is a stranger to the world by nature, their essence
being one, and God one. But the elect man dwells as a sojourner, knowing
all things to be possessed and disposed of; and he makes use of the
things which the Pythagoreans make out to be the threefold good things.
The body, too, as one sent on a distant pilgrimage, uses inns and
dwellings by the way, having care of the things of the world, of the
places where he halts; but leaving his dwelling-place and property
without excessive emotion; readily following him that leads him away
from life; by no means and on no occasion turning back; giving thanks
for his sojourn, and blessing \[God\] for his departure, embracing the
mansion that is in heaven. “For we know, that, if the earthly house of
our tabernacle be dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not
made with hands, eternal in the heavens. For we that are in this
tabernacle do groan, desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is
from heaven: if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.
For we walk by faith, not by sight,” <span
id="fr_2923"></span>[2924](#fn_2923.md) as the apostle says; “and we are
willing rather to be absent from the body, and present with God.” The
rather is in comparison. And comparison obtains in the case of things
that fall under resemblance; as the more valiant man is more valiant
among the valiant, and most valiant among cowards. Whence he adds,
“Wherefore we strive, whether present or absent, to be accepted with
Him,” <span id="fr_2924"></span>[2925](#fn_2924.md) that is, God, whose
work and creation are all things, both the world and things
supramundane. I admire Epicharmus, who clearly says:—

> <span id="vi.iv.iv.xxi-p47.2"></span> “Endowed with pious mind, you
> will not, in dying,  
> Suffer aught evil. The spirit will dwell in heaven above;”  

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xxi-p48"></span>and the minstrel <span
id="fr_2925"></span>[2926](#fn_2925.md) who sings:—

> <span id="vi.iv.iv.xxi-p49.1"></span> “The souls of the wicked flit
> about below the skies on earth,  
> In murderous pains beneath inevitable yokes of evils;  
> But those of the pious dwell in the heavens,  
> Hymning in songs the Great, the Blessed One.”  

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xxi-p50"></span>The soul is not then sent down from
heaven to what is worse. For God works all things up to what is better.
But the soul which has chosen the best life—the life that is from God
and righteousness—exchanges earth for heaven. With reason therefore,
Job, who had attained to knowledge, said, “Now I know that thou canst do
all things; and nothing is impossible to Thee. For who tells me of what
I know not, great and wonderful things with which I was unacquainted?
And I felt myself vile, considering myself to be earth and ashes.” <span
id="fr_2926"></span>[2927](#fn_2926.md) For he who, being in a state of
ignorance, is sinful, “is earth and ashes;” while he who is in a state
of knowledge, being assimilated as far as possible to God, is already
spiritual, and so elect. And that Scripture calls the senseless and
disobedient “earth,” will be made clear by Jeremiah the prophet, saying,
in reference to Joachim and his brethren “Earth, earth, hear the word of
the <span class="sc"><span id="vi.iv.iv.xxi-p51.2"></span>Lord</span>;
Write this man, as man excommunicated.” <span
id="fr_2927"></span>[2928](#fn_2927.md) And another prophet says again,
“Hear, O heaven; and give ear, O earth,” <span
id="fr_2928"></span>[2929](#fn_2928.md) calling understanding “ear,” and
the soul of the Gnostic, that of the man who has applied himself to the
contemplation of heaven and divine things, and in this way has become an
Israelite, “heaven.” For again he calls him who has made ignorance and
hardness of heart his choice, “earth.” And the expression “give ear” he
derives from the “organs of hearing,” “the ears,” attributing carnal
things to those who cleave to the things of sense. Such are they of whom
Micah the prophet says, “Hear the word of the Lord, ye peoples who dwell
with pangs.” <span id="fr_2929"></span>[2930](#fn_2929.md) And Abraham
said, “By no means. The Lord is He who judgeth the earth;” <span
id="fr_2930"></span>[2931](#fn_2930.md) “since he that believeth not, is,”
according to the utterance of the Saviour, “condemned already.” <span
id="fr_2931"></span>[2932](#fn_2931.md) And there is written in the
Kings <span id="fr_2932"></span>[2933](#fn_2932.md) the judgment and
sentence of the Lord, which stands thus: “The Lord hears the righteous,
but the wicked He saveth not, because they do not desire to know God.”
For the Almighty will not accomplish what is absurd. What do the
heresies say to this utterance, seeing Scripture proclaims the Almighty
God to be good, and not the author of evil and wrong, if indeed
ignorance arises from one not knowing? But God does nothing absurd. “For
this God,” it is said, “is our God, and there is none to save besides
Him.” <span id="fr_2933"></span>[2934](#fn_2933.md) “For there is no
unrighteousness <span id="page_441">p. 441</span> <span
id="vi.iv.iv.xxi-Page_441"></span>with God,” <span
id="fr_2934"></span>[2935](#fn_2934.md) according to the apostle. And
clearly yet the prophet teaches the will of God, and the gnostic
proficiency, in these words: “And now, Israel, what doth the <span
class="sc"><span id="vi.iv.iv.xxi-p59.2"></span>Lord</span> God require
of thee, but to fear the <span class="sc"><span
id="vi.iv.iv.xxi-p59.3"></span>Lord</span> thy God, and walk in all His
ways, and love Him, and serve Him alone?” <span
id="fr_2935"></span>[2936](#fn_2935.md) He asks of thee, who hast the power
of choosing salvation. What is it, then, that the Pythagoreans mean when
they bid us “pray with the voice”? As seems to me, not that they thought
the Divinity could not hear those who speak silently, but because they
wished prayers to be right, which no one would be ashamed to make in the
knowledge of many. We shall, however, treat of prayer in due course by
and by. But we ought to have works that cry aloud, as becoming “those
who walk in the day.” <span id="fr_2936"></span>[2937](#fn_2936.md) “Let
thy works shine,” <span id="fr_2937"></span>[2938](#fn_2937.md) and behold
a man and his works before his face. “For behold God and His
works.” <span id="fr_2938"></span>[2939](#fn_2938.md) For the gnostic must,
as far as is possible, imitate God. And the poets call the elect in
their pages godlike and gods, and equal to the gods, and equal in
sagacity to Zeus, and having counsels like the gods, and resembling the
gods,—nibbling, as seems to me, at the expression, “in the image and
likeness.” <span id="fr_2939"></span>[2940](#fn_2939.md)

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xxi-p65"></span>Euripides accordingly says, “Golden
wings are round my back, and I am shod with the winged sandals of the
Sirens; and I shall go aloft into the wide ether, to hold convene with
Zeus.”

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xxi-p66"></span>But I shall pray the Spirit of Christ
to wing me to my Jerusalem. For the Stoics say that heaven is properly a
city, but places here on earth are not cities; for they are called so,
but are not. For a city is an important thing, and the people a decorous
body, and a multitude of men regulated by law as the church by the
word—a city on earth impregnable—free from tyranny; a product of the
divine will on earth as in heaven. Images of this city the poets create
with their pen. For the Hyperboreans, and the Arimaspian cities, and the
Elysian plains, are commonwealths of just men. And we know Plato’s city
placed as a pattern in heaven. <span
