<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii"></span>

##### <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p0.1"></span>Chapter II.—The Subject of Plagiarisms Resumed. The Greeks Plagiarized from One Another.

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p1"></span>Before handling the point proposed, we
must, by way of preface, add to the close of the fifth book what is
wanting. For since we have shown that the symbolical style was ancient,
and was employed not only by our prophets, but also by the majority of
the ancient Greeks, and by not a few of the rest of the Gentile
Barbarians, it was requisite to proceed to the mysteries of the
initiated. I postpone the elucidation of these till we advance to the
confutation of what is said by the Greeks on first principles; for we
shall show that the mysteries belong to the same branch of speculation.
And having proved that the declaration of Hellenic thought is
illuminated all round by the truth, bestowed on us in the Scriptures,
taking it according to the sense, we have proved, not to say what is
invidious, that the theft of the truth passed to them.

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p2"></span>Come, and let us adduce the Greeks as
witnesses against themselves to the theft. For, inasmuch as they pilfer
from one another, they establish the fact that they are thieves; and
although against their will, they are detected, clandestinely
appropriating to those of their own race the truth which belongs to us.
For if they do not keep their hands from each other, they will hardly do
it from our authors. I shall say nothing of philosophic dogmas, since
the very persons who are the authors of the divisions into sects,
confess in writing, so as not to be convicted of ingratitude, that they
have received from Socrates the most important of their dogmas. But
after availing myself of a few testimonies of men most talked of, and of
repute among the Greeks, and exposing their plagiarizing style, and
selecting them from various periods, I shall turn to what follows.

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p3"></span>Orpheus, then, having composed the
line:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p3.1"></span> “Since nothing else is more
> shameless and wretched than woman,”  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p4"></span>Homer plainly says:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p4.1"></span> “Since nothing else is more
> dreadful and shameless than a woman.” <span
> id="fr_3197"></span>[3198](#fn_3197.md)  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p6"></span>And Musæus having written:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p6.1"></span> “Since art is greatly superior to
> strength,”—  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p7"></span>Homer says:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p7.1"></span> “By art rather than strength is
> the woodcutter greatly superior.” <span
> id="fr_3198"></span>[3199](#fn_3198.md)  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p10"></span>Again, Musæus having composed the
lines:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p10.1"></span> “And as the fruitful field
> produceth leaves,  
> And on the ash trees some fade, others grow,  
> So whirls the race of man its leaf,” <span
> id="fr_3199"></span>[3200](#fn_3199.md) —  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p12"></span>Homer transcribes:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p12.1"></span> “Some of the leaves the wind
> strews on the ground.  
> The budding wood bears some; in time of spring,  
> They come. So springs one race of men, and one departs.” <span
> id="fr_3200"></span>[3201](#fn_3200.md)  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p14"></span>Again, Homer having said:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p14.1"></span> “It is unholy to exult over dead
> men,” <span id="fr_3201"></span>[3202](#fn_3201.md)  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p16"></span>Archilochus and Cratinus write, the
former:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p16.1"></span> “It is not noble at dead men to
> sneer;”  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p17"></span>and Cratinus in the *Lacones:*—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p17.1"></span> “For men ’tis dreadful to exult  
> Much o’er the stalwart dead.”  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p18"></span>Again, Archilochus, transferring that
Homeric line:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p18.1"></span> “I erred, nor say I nay: instead
> of many” <span id="fr_3202"></span>[3203](#fn_3202.md) —  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p20"></span>writes thus:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p20.1"></span> “I erred, and this mischief hath
> somehow seized another.”  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p21"></span>As certainly also that line:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p21.1"></span> “Even-handed <span
> id="fr_3203"></span>[3204](#fn_3203.md) war the slayer slays.” <span
> id="fr_3204"></span>[3205](#fn_3204.md)  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p24"></span>He also, altering, has given forth
thus:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p24.1"></span> “I will do it.  
> For Mars to men in truth is evenhanded.” <span
> id="fr_3205"></span>[3206](#fn_3205.md)  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p26"></span>Also, translating the following:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p26.1"></span> “The issues of victory among men
> depend on the gods,” <span id="fr_3206"></span>[3207](#fn_3206.md)  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p28"></span>he openly encourages youth, in the
following iambic:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p28.1"></span> “Victory’s issues on the gods
> depend.”  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p29"></span>Again, Homer having said:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p29.1"></span> “With feet unwashed sleeping on
> the ground,” <span id="fr_3207"></span>[3208](#fn_3207.md)  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p31"></span>Euripides writes in *Erechtheus:*—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p31.1"></span> “Upon the plain spread with no
> couch they sleep,  
> Nor in the streams of water lave their feet.”  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p32"></span>Archilochus having likewise said:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p32.1"></span> “But one with this and one with
> that  
> His heart delights,”—  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p33"></span>in correspondence with the Homeric
line:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p33.1"></span> “For one in these deeds, one in
> those delights,” <span id="fr_3208"></span>[3209](#fn_3208.md) —  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p35"></span>Euripides says in *Œneus:*—

<span id="page_482">p. 482</span> <span
id="vi.iv.vi.ii-Page_482"></span>

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p35.1"></span> “But one in these ways, one in
> those, has more delight.”  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p36"></span>And I have heard Æschylus saying:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p36.1"></span> “He who is happy ought to stay at
> home;  
> There should he also stay, who speeds not well.”  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p37"></span>And Euripides, too, shouting the like
on the stage:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p37.1"></span> “Happy the man who, prosperous,
> stays at home.”  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p38"></span>Menander, too, on comedy, saying:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p38.1"></span> “He ought at home to stay, and
> free remain,  
> Or be no longer rightly happy.”  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p39"></span>Again, Theognis having said:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p39.1"></span> “The exile has no comrade dear
> and true,”—  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p40"></span>Euripides has written:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p40.1"></span> “Far from the poor flies every
> friend.”  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p41"></span>And Epicharmus, saying:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p41.1"></span> “Daughter, woe worth the day!  
> Thee who art old I marry to a youth;” <span
> id="fr_3209"></span>[3210](#fn_3209.md)  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p43"></span>and adding:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p43.1"></span> “For the young husband takes some
> other girl,  
> And for another husband longs the wife,”—  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p44"></span>Euripides <span
id="fr_3210"></span>[3211](#fn_3210.md) writes:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p45.1"></span> “’Tis bad to yoke an old wife to
> a youth;  
> For he desires to share another’s bed,  
> And she, by him deserted, mischief plots.”  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p46"></span>Euripides having, besides, said in the
*Medea:*—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p46.1"></span> “For no good do a bad man’s
> gifts,”—  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p47"></span>Sophocles in *Ajax Flagellifer* utters
this iambic:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p47.1"></span> “For foes’ gifts are no gifts,
> nor any boon.” <span id="fr_3211"></span>[3212](#fn_3211.md)  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p49"></span>Solon having written:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p49.1"></span> “For surfeit insolence begets,  
> When store of wealth attends.”  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p50"></span>Theognis writes in the same way:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p50.1"></span> “For surfeit insolence begets,  
> When store of wealth attends the bad.”  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p51"></span>Whence also Thucydides, in the
*Histories*, says: “Many men, to whom in a great degree, and in a short
time, unlooked-for prosperity comes, are wont to turn to insolence.” And
Philistus <span id="fr_3212"></span>[3213](#fn_3212.md) likewise imitates
the same sentiment, expressing himself thus: “And the many things which
turn out prosperously to men, in accordance with reason, have an
incredibly dangerous <span id="fr_3213"></span>[3214](#fn_3213.md) tendency
to misfortune. For those who meet with unlooked success beyond their
expectations, are for the most part wont to turn to insolence.” Again,
Euripides having written:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p53.3"></span> “For children sprung of parents
> who have led  
> A hard and toilsome life, superior are;”  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p54"></span>Critias writes: “For I begin with a
man’s origin: how far the best and strongest in body will he be, if his
father exercises himself, and eats in a hardy way, and subjects his body
to toilsome labour; and if the mother of the future child be strong in
body, and give herself exercise.”

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p55"></span>Again, Homer having said of the
Hephæstus-made shield:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p55.1"></span> “Upon it earth and heaven and sea
> he made,  
> And Ocean’s rivers’ mighty strength portrayed,”  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p56"></span>Pherecydes of Syros says:—“Zas makes a
cloak large and beautiful, and works on it earth and Ogenus, and the
palace of Ogenus.”

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p57"></span>And Homer having said:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p57.1"></span> “Shame, which greatly hurts a man
> or helps,” <span id="fr_3214"></span>[3215](#fn_3214.md) —  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p59"></span>Euripides writes in *Erechtheus:*—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p59.1"></span> “Of shame I find it hard to
> judge;  
> ’Tis needed. ’Tis at times a great mischief.”  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p60"></span>Take, by way of parallel, such
plagiarisms as the following, from those who flourished together, and
were rivals of each other. From the *Orestes* of Euripides:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p60.1"></span> “Dear charm of sleep, aid in
> disease.”  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p61"></span>From the *Eriphyle* of Sophocles:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p61.1"></span> “Hie thee to sleep, healer of
> that disease.”  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p62"></span>And from the *Antigone* of Sophocles:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p62.1"></span> “Bastardy is opprobrious in name;
> but the nature is equal;” <span id="fr_3215"></span>[3216](#fn_3215.md)  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p64"></span>And from the *Aleuades* of Sophocles:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p64.1"></span> “Each good thing has its nature
> equal.”  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p65"></span>Again, in the *Ctimenus* <span
id="fr_3216"></span>[3217](#fn_3216.md) of Euripides:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p66.1"></span> “For him who toils, God helps;”  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p67"></span>And in the *Minos* of Sophocles;

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p67.1"></span> “To those who act not, fortune is
> no ally;”  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p68"></span>And from the *Alexander* of
Euripides:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p68.1"></span> “But time will show; and
> learning, by that test,  
> I shall know whether thou art good or bad;”  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p69"></span>And from the *Hipponos* of Sophocles:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p69.1"></span> “Besides, conceal thou nought;
> since Time,  
> That sees all, hears all, all things will unfold.”  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p70"></span>But let us similarly run over the
following; for Eumelus having composed the line,

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p70.1"></span> “Of Memory and Olympian Zeus the
> daughters nine,”  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p71"></span>Solon thus begins the elegy:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p71.1"></span> “Of Memory and Olympian Zeus the
> children bright.”  

<span id="page_483">p. 483</span> <span
id="vi.iv.vi.ii-Page_483"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p72"></span>Again, Euripides, paraphrasing the
Homeric line:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p72.1"></span> “What, whence art thou? Thy city
> and thy parents, where?” <span id="fr_3217"></span>[3218](#fn_3217.md)  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p74"></span>employs the following iambics in
*Ægeus:*—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p74.1"></span> “What country shall we say that
> thou hast left  
> To roam in exile, what thy land—the bound  
> Of thine own native soil? Who thee begat?  
> And of what father dost thou call thyself the son?”  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p75"></span>And what? Theognis <span
id="fr_3218"></span>[3219](#fn_3218.md) having said:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p76.8"></span> “Wine largely drunk is bad; but
> if one use  
> It with discretion, ’tis not bad, but good,”—  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p77"></span>does not Panyasis write?

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p77.1"></span> “Above the gods’ best gift to men
> ranks wine,  
> In measure drunk; but in excess the worst.”  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p78"></span>Hesiod, too, saying:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p78.1"></span> “But for the fire to thee I’ll
> give a plague, <span id="fr_3219"></span>[3220](#fn_3219.md)  
> For all men to delight themselves withal,”—  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p80"></span>Euripides writes:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p80.1"></span> “And for the fire  
> Another fire greater and unconquerable,  
> Sprung up in the shape of women” <span
> id="fr_3220"></span>[3221](#fn_3220.md)  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p82"></span>And in addition, Homer, saying:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p82.1"></span> “There is no satiating the greedy
> paunch,  
> Baneful, which many plagues has caused to men.” <span
> id="fr_3221"></span>[3222](#fn_3221.md)  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p84"></span>Euripides says:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p84.1"></span> “Dire need and baneful paunch me
> overcome;  
> From which all evils come.”  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p85"></span>Besides, Callias the comic poet having
written:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p85.1"></span> “With madmen, all men must be
> mad, they say,”—  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p86"></span>Menander, in the *Poloumenoi*,
expresses himself similarly, saying:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p86.1"></span> “The presence of wisdom is not
> always suitable:  
> One sometimes must with others play <span
> id="fr_3222"></span>[3223](#fn_3222.md) the fool.”  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p88"></span>And Antimachus of Teos having said:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p88.1"></span> “From gifts, to mortals many ills
> arise,”—  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p89"></span>Augias composed the line:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p89.1"></span> “For gifts men’s mind and acts
> deceive.”  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p90"></span>And Hesiod having said:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p90.1"></span> “Than a good wife, no man a
> better thing  
> Ere gained; than a bad wife, a worse,”—  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p91"></span>Simonides said:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p91.1"></span> “A better prize than a good wife
> no man  
> Ere gained, than a bad one nought worse.”  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p92"></span>Again, Epicharmas having said:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p92.1"></span> “As destined long to live, and
> yet not long,  
> Think of thyself.”—  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p93"></span>Euripides writes:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p93.1"></span> “Why? seeing the wealth we have
> uncertain is,  
> Why don’t we live as free from care, as pleasant  
> As we may?”  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p94"></span>Similarly also, the comic poet
Diphilus having said:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p94.1"></span> “The life of men is prone to
> change,”—  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p95"></span>Posidippus says:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p95.1"></span> “No man of mortal mould his life
> has passed  
> From suffering free. Nor to the end again  
> Has continued prosperous.”  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p96"></span>Similarly <span
id="fr_3223"></span>[3224](#fn_3223.md) speaks to thee Plato, writing of
man as a creature subject to change. Again, Euripides having said:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p97.3"></span> “Oh life to mortal men of trouble
> full,  
> How slippery in everything art thou!  
> Now grow’st thou, and thou now decay’st away.  
> And there is set no limit, no, not one,  
> For mortals of their course to make an end,  
> Except when Death’s remorseless final end  
> Comes, sent from Zeus,”—  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p98"></span>Diphilus writes:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p98.1"></span> “There is no life which has not
> its own ills,  
> Pains, cares, thefts, and anxieties, disease;  
> And Death, as a physician, coming, gives  
> Rest to their victims in his quiet sleep.” <span
> id="fr_3224"></span>[3225](#fn_3224.md)  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p100"></span>Furthermore, Euripides having said:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p100.1"></span> “Many are fortune’s shapes,  
> And many things contrary to expectation the gods perform,”—  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p101"></span>The tragic poet Theodectes similarly
writes:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p101.1"></span> “The instability of mortals’
> fates.”  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p102"></span>And Bacchylides having said:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p102.1"></span> “To few <span
> id="fr_3225"></span>[3226](#fn_3225.md) alone of mortals is it given  
> To reach hoary age, being prosperous all the while,  
> And not meet with calamities,”—  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p104"></span>Moschion, the comic poet, writes:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p104.1"></span> “But he of all men is most
> blest,  
> Who leads throughout an equal life.”  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p105"></span>And you will find that, Theognis
having said:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p105.1"></span> “For no advantage to a man grown
> old  
> A young wife is, who will not, as a ship  
> The helm, obey,”—  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p106"></span>Aristophanes, the comic poet,
writes:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p106.1"></span> “An old man to a young wife
> suits but ill.”  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p107"></span>For Anacreon, having written:—

<span id="page_484">p. 484</span> <span
id="vi.iv.vi.ii-Page_484"></span>

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p107.1"></span> “Luxurious love I sing,  
> With flowery garlands graced,  
> He is of gods the king,  
> He mortal men subdues,—  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p108"></span>Euripides writes:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p108.1"></span> “For love not only men
> attacks,  
> And women; but disturbs  
> The souls of gods above, and to the sea  
> Descends.”  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p109"></span>But not to protract the discourse
further, in our anxiety to show the propensity of the Greeks to
plagiarism in expressions and dogmas, allow us to adduce the express
testimony of Hippias, the sophist of Elea, who discourses on the point
in hand, and speaks thus: “Of these things some perchance are said by
Orpheus, some briefly by Musæus; some in one place, others in other
places; some by Hesiod, some by Homer, some by the rest of the poets;
and some in prose compositions, some by Greeks, some by Barbarians. And
I from all these, placing together the things of most importance and of
kindred character, will make the present discourse new and varied.”

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p110"></span>And in order that we may see that
philosophy and history, and even rhetoric, are not free of a like
reproach, it is right to adduce a few instances from them. For Alcmæon
of Crotona having said, “It is easier to guard against a man who is an
enemy than a friend,” Sophocles wrote in the *Antigone:*—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p110.1"></span> “For what sore more grievous
> than a bad friend?”  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p111"></span>And Xenophon said: “No man can injure
enemies in any way other than by appearing to be a friend.”

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p112"></span>And Euripides having said in
*Telephus:*—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p112.1"></span> “Shall we Greeks be slaves to
> Barbarians?”—  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p113"></span>Thrasymachus, in the oration for the
Larissæans, says: “Shall we be slaves to Archelaus—Greeks to a
Barbarian?”

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p114"></span>And Orpheus having said:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p114.1"></span> “Water is the change for soul,
> and death for water;  
> From water is earth, and what comes from earth is again water,  
> And from that, soul, which changes the whole ether;”  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p115"></span>and Heraclitus, putting together the
expressions from these lines, writes thus:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p115.1"></span> “It is death for souls to become
> water, and death for  
> water to become earth; and from earth comes water,  
> and from water soul.”  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p116"></span>And Athamas the Pythagorean having
said, “Thus was produced the beginning of the universe; and there are
four roots—fire, water, air, earth: for from these is the origination of
what is produced,”—Empedocles of Agrigentum wrote:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p116.1"></span> “The four roots of all things
> first do thou hear—  
> Fire, water, earth, and ether’s boundless height:  
> For of these all that was, is, shall be, comes.”  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p117"></span>And Plato having said, “Wherefore
also the gods, knowing men, release sooner from life those they value
most,” Menander wrote:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p117.1"></span> “Whom the gods love, dies
> young.”  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p118"></span>And Euripides having written in the
*Œnomaus:*—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p118.1"></span> “We judge of things obscure from
> what we see;”  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p119"></span>and in the *Phœnix:*—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p119.1"></span> “By signs the obscure is fairly
> grasped,”—  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p120"></span>Hyperides says, “But we must
investigate things unseen by learning from signs and probabilities.” And
Isocrates having said, “We must conjecture the future by the past,”
Andocides does not shrink from saying, “For we must make use of what has
happened previously as signs in reference to what is to be.” Besides,
Theognis having said:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p120.1"></span> “The evil of counterfeit silver
> and gold is not intolerable,  
> O Cyrnus, and to a wise man is not difficult of detection;  
> But if the mind of a friend is hidden in his breast,  
> If he is false, <span id="fr_3226"></span>[3227](#fn_3226.md) and has a
> treacherous heart within,  
> This is the basest thing for mortals, caused by God,  
> And of all things the hardest to detect,”—  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p122"></span>Euripides writes:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p122.1"></span> “Oh Zeus, why hast thou given to
> men clear tests  
> Of spurious gold, while on the body grows  
> No mark sufficing to discover clear  
> The wicked man?”  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p123"></span>Hyperides himself also says, “There
is no feature of the mind impressed on the countenance of men.”

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p124"></span>Again, Stasinus having composed the
line:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p124.1"></span> “Fool, who, having slain the
> father, leaves the children,”—  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p125"></span>Xenophon <span
id="fr_3227"></span>[3228](#fn_3227.md) says, “For I seem to myself to have
acted in like manner, as if one who killed the father should spare his
children.” And Sophocles having written in the *Antigone:*—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p126.1"></span> “Mother and father being in
> Hades now,  
> No brother ever can to me spring forth,”—  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p127"></span>Herodotus says, “Mother and father
being no more, I shall not have another brother.” In addition to these,
Theopompus having written:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p127.1"></span> “Twice children are old men in
> very truth;”  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p128"></span>And before him Sophocles in
*Peleus:*—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p128.1"></span> “Peleus, the son of Æacus, I,
> sole housekeeper,  
> Guide, old as he is now, and train again,  
> For the aged man is once again a child,”—  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p129"></span>Antipho the orator says, “For the
nursing of the old is like the nursing of children.” Also the <span
id="page_485">p. 485</span> <span
id="vi.iv.vi.ii-Page_485"></span>philosopher Plato says, “The old man
then, as seems, will be twice a child.” Further, Thucydides having said,
“We alone bore the brunt at Marathon,” <span
id="fr_3228"></span>[3229](#fn_3228.md) —Demosthenes said, “By those who
bore the brunt at Marathon.” Nor will I omit the following. Cratinus
having said in the *Pytine:* <span id="fr_3229"></span>[3230](#fn_3229.md)
—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p131.3"></span> “The preparation perchance you
> know,”  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p132"></span>Andocides the orator says, “The
preparation, gentlemen of the jury, and the eagerness of our enemies,
almost all of you know.” Similarly also Nicias, in the speech on the
deposit, against Lysias, says, “The preparation and the eagerness of the
adversaries, ye see, O gentlemen of the jury.” After him Æschines says,
“You see the preparation, O men of Athens, and the line of battle.”
Again, Demosthenes having said, “What zeal and what canvassing, O men of
Athens, have been employed in this contest, I think almost all of you
are aware;” and Philinus similarly, “What zeal, what forming of the line
of battle, gentlemen of the jury, have taken place in this contest, I
think not one of you is ignorant.” Isocrates, again, having said, “As if
she were related to his wealth, not him,” Lysias says in the *Orphics*,
“And he was plainly related not to the persons, but to the money.” Since
Homer also having written:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p132.1"></span> “O friend, if in this war, by
> taking flight,  
> We should from age and death exemption win,  
> I would not fight among the first myself,  
> Nor would I send thee to the glorious fray;  
> But now—for myriad fates of death attend  
> In any case, which man may not escape  
> Or shun—come on. To some one we shall bring  
> Renown, or some one shall to us,” <span
> id="fr_3230"></span>[3231](#fn_3230.md) —  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p134"></span>Theopompus writes, “For if, by
avoiding the present danger, we were to pass the rest of our time in
security, to show love of life would not be wonderful. But now, so many
fatalities are incident to life, that death in battle seems preferable.”
And what? Child the sophist having uttered the apophthegm, “Become
surety, and mischief is at hand,” did not Epicharmus utter the same
sentiment in other terms, when he said, “Suretyship is the daughter of
mischief, and loss that of suretyship?” <span
id="fr_3231"></span>[3232](#fn_3231.md) Further, Hippocrates the physician
having written, “You must look to time, and locality, and age, and
disease,” Euripides says in *Hexameters:* <span
id="fr_3232"></span>[3233](#fn_3232.md) —

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p136.3"></span> “Those who the healing art would
> practice well,  
> Must study people’s modes of life, and note  
> The soil, and the diseases so consider.”  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p137"></span>Homer again, having written:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p137.1"></span> “I say no mortal man can doom
> escape,”—  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p138"></span>Archinus says, “All men are bound to
die either sooner or later;” and Demosthenes, “To all men death is the
end of life, though one should keep himself shut up in a coop.”

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p139"></span>And Herodotus, again, having said, in
his discourse about Glaucus the Spartan, that the Pythian said, “In the
case of the Deity, to say and to do are equivalent,” Aristophanes said:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p139.1"></span> “For to think and to do are
> equivalent.”  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p140"></span>And before him, Parmenides of Elea
said:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p140.1"></span> “For thinking and being are the
> same.”  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p141"></span>And Plato having said, “And we shall
show, not absurdly perhaps, that the beginning of love is sight; and
hope diminishes the passion, memory nourishes it, and intercourse
preserves it;” does not Philemon the comic poet write:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p141.1"></span> “First all see, then admire;  
> Then gaze, then come to hope;  
> And thus arises love?”  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p142"></span>Further, Demosthenes having said,
“For to all of us death is a debt,” and so forth, Phanocles writes in
*Loves*, or *The Beautiful:*—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p142.1"></span> “But from the Fates’ unbroken
> thread escape  
> Is none for those that feed on earth.”  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p143"></span>You will also find that Plato having
said, “For the first sprout of each plant, having got a fair start,
according to the virtue of its own nature, is most powerful in inducing
the appropriate end;” the historian writes, “Further, it is not natural
for one of the wild plants to become cultivated, after they have passed
the earlier period of growth;” and the following of Empedocles:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p143.1"></span> “For I already have been boy and
> girl,  
> And bush, and bird, and mute fish in the sea,”—  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p144"></span>Euripides transcribes in
*Chrysippus:*—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p144.1"></span> “But nothing dies  
> Of things that are; but being dissolved,  
> One from the other,  
> Shows another form.”  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p145"></span>And Plato having said, in the
*Republic*, that women were common, Euripides writes in the
*Protesilaus:*—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p145.1"></span> “For common, then, is woman’s
> bed.”  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p146"></span>Further, Euripides having written:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p146.1"></span> “For to the temperate enough
> sufficient is”—  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p147"></span>Epicurus expressly says, “Sufficiency
is the greatest riches of all.”

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p148"></span>Again, Aristophanes having written:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p148.1"></span> “Life thou securely shalt enjoy,
> being just  
> And free from turmoil, and from fear live well,”—  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p149"></span>Epicurus says, “The greatest fruit of
righteousness is tranquillity.”

<span id="page_486">p. 486</span> <span
id="vi.iv.vi.ii-Page_486"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p150"></span>Let these species, then, of Greek
plagiarism of sentiments, being such, stand as sufficient for a clear
specimen to him who is capable of perceiving.

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p151"></span>And not only have they been detected
pirating and paraphrasing thoughts and expressions, as will be shown;
but they will also be convicted of the possession of what is entirely
stolen. For stealing entirely what is the production of others, they
have published it as their own; as Eugamon of Cyrene did the entire book
on the Thesprotians from Musæus, and Pisander of Camirus the Heraclea of
Pisinus of Lindus, and Panyasis of Halicarnassus, the capture of Œchalia
from Cleophilus of Samos.

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p152"></span>You will also find that Homer, the
great poet, took from Orpheus, from the *Disappearance* of Dionysus,
those words and what follows verbatim:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p152.1"></span> “As a man trains a luxuriant
> shoot of olive.” <span id="fr_3233"></span>[3234](#fn_3233.md)  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p154"></span>And in the *Theogony*, it is said by
Orpheus of Kronos:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p154.1"></span> “He lay, his thick neck bent
> aside; and him  
> All-conquering Sleep had seized.”  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p155"></span>These Homer transferrred to the
Cyclops. <span id="fr_3234"></span>[3235](#fn_3234.md) And Hesiod writes of
Melampous:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p156.1"></span> “Gladly to hear, what the
> immortals have assigned  
> To men, the brave from cowards clearly marks;”  

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p157"></span>and so forth, taking it word for word
from the poet Musæus.

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p158"></span>And Aristophanes the comic poet has,
in the first of the *Thesmophoriazusæ*, transferred the words from the
*Empiprameni* of Cratinus. And Plato the comic poet, and Aristophanes in
*Dædalus*, steal from one another. *Cocalus*, composed by Araros, <span
id="fr_3235"></span>[3236](#fn_3235.md) the son of Aristophanes, was by the
comic poet Philemon altered, and made into the comedy called
*Hypobolimœns*.

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p160"></span>Eumelus and Acusilaus the
historiographers changed the contents of Hesiod into prose, and
published them as their own. Gorgias of Leontium and Eudemus of Naxus,
the historians, stole from Melesagoras. And, besides, there is Bion of
Proconnesus, who epitomized and transcribed the writings of the ancient
Cadmus, and Archilochus, and Aristotle, and Leandrus, and Hellanicus,
and Hecatæus, and Androtion, and Philochorus. Dieuchidas of Megara
transferred the beginning of his treatise from the *Deucalion* of
Hellanicus. I pass over in silence Heraclitus of Ephesus, who took a
very great deal from Orpheus.

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p161"></span>From Pythagoras Plato derived the
immortality of the soul; and he from the Egyptians. And many of the
Platonists composed books, in which they show that the Stoics, as we
said in the beginning, and Aristotle, took the most and principal of
their dogmas from Plato. Epicurus also pilfered his leading dogmas from
Democritus. Let these things then be so. For life would fail me, were I
to undertake to go over the subject in detail, to expose the selfish
plagiarism of the Greeks, and how they claim the discovery of the best
of their doctrines, which they have received from us.

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p79"></span> From Jupiter’s address (referring to
Pandora) to Prometheus, after stealing fire from heaven. The passage in
Hesiod runs thus:—

> <span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p79.1"></span> “You rejoice at stealing fire and
> outwitting my mind:  
> But I will give you, and to future men, a great plague.  
> And for the fire will give to them a bane in which  
> All will delight their heart, embracing their own bane.”

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p87"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p87.1"></span>συμμανῆναι</span> is doubtless here the
true reading, for which the text has <span class="Greek"><span

<span id="fn_3223"></span>[483:3224](0020392.htm#fr_3223.md) <span
id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p96.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p97"></span> The text has <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p97.1"></span>κατ᾽ ἄλλα</span>. And
although Sylburgius very properly remarks, that the conjecture <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p97.2"></span>κατάλληλα</span>
instead is uncertain, it is so suitable to the sense here, that we have
no hesitation in adopting it.

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p103"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p103.1"></span>παύροισι</span>, “few,” instead of <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p103.2"></span>παῤοἷσι</span> and
<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p103.3"></span>πράσσοντας</span> instead of <span

<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p103.5"></span>δύαις</span>,
“calamities,” instead of <span class="Greek"><span

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p121"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p121.1"></span>ψυδνός = ψυδρός</span>—which, however,
occurs nowhere but here—is adopted as preferable to <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p121.2"></span>ψεδνός</span> (bald),
which yields no sense, or <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p121.3"></span>ψυχρός</span>. Sylburgius <span

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p130"></span> Instead of <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p130.1"></span>Μαραθωνίται</span>, as in the text, we
read from Thucydides <span class="Greek"><span

flask covered with plaited osiers. The name of a comedy by Cratinus
(Liddell and Scott’s *Lexicon*). \[Elucidation I.\]

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p135"></span> Grotius’s correction has been
adopted, <span class="Greek"><span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p135.1"></span>ἐγγύας

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p136"></span> In the text before *In Hexameters*
we have <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p136.1"></span>τηρήσει</span>, which has occasioned much
trouble to the critics. Although not entirely satisfactory, yet the most
probable is the correction <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p136.2"></span>θέλουσι</span>, as above.

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p159"></span> According to the correction of
Casaubon, who, instead of <span class="Greek"><span

class="Greek"><span id="vi.iv.vi.ii-p159.2"></span>Ἀραρώς</span>. Others
ascribed the comedy to Aristophanes himself.
