### <span id="vi.iv.i.xxx-p0.1"></span>Elucidations.

##### <span id="vi.iv.i.xxx-p0.2"></span>I.

<span id="vi.iv.i.xxx-p1"></span>(Purpose of the *Stromata* <span
id="fr_2142"></span>[2143](#fn_2142) .md)

<span id="vi.iv.i.xxx-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="vi.iv.i.xxx-p3.1"></span>The</span> Alexandrian Gnostics were the
pestilent outgrowth of *pseudo-Platonism;* and nobody could comprehend
their root-errors, and their branching thorns and thistles, better than
Clement. His superiority in philosophy and classical culture was
exhibited, therefore, in his writings, as a necessary preliminary. Like
a good nautical combatant, his effort was to “get to windward,” and so
bear down upon the enemy (to use an anachronism) with heavy-shotted
broadsides. And we must not blame Clement for his plan of “taking the
wind out of their sails,” by showing that an eclectic philosophy might
be made to harmonize with the Gospel. His plan was that of melting the
gold out of divers ores, and throwing the dross away. Pure gold, he
argues, is gold wherever it may be found, and even in the purse of
“thieves and robbers.” So, then, he “takes from them the armour in which
they trusted, and divides the spoils.” He will not concede to them the
name of “Gnostics,” but wrests it from them, just as we reclaim the name
of “Catholics” from the Tridentine innovators, who have imposed a modern
creed (and are constantly adding to it) upon the Latin churches. Here,
then, let me quote the *Account* of Bishop Kaye. He says, “The object of
Clement, in composing the *Stromata*, was to describe the true
‘Gnostic,’ or perfect Christian, in order to furnish the believer with a
model for his imitation, and to prevent him from being led astray by the
representations of the Valentinians and other gnostic sects.” … “Before
we proceed to consider his description of the Gnostic, however, it will
be necessary briefly to review his opinions respecting the nature and
condition of man.”

<span id="vi.iv.i.xxx-p4"></span>Here follows a luminous analysis
(occupying pp. 229–238 of Kaye’s work), after which he says,—

<span id="vi.iv.i.xxx-p5"></span>“The foregoing brief notice of
Clement’s opinions respecting man, his soul, and his fallen state,
appeared necessary as an introduction to the description of the *true
Gnostic*. By <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.i.xxx-p5.1"></span>γνῶσις</span>, Clement understood the
perfect knowledge of all that relates to God, His nature, and
dispensations. He speaks of a twofold knowledge,—one, common to all men,
and born of sense; the other, the genuine <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.i.xxx-p5.2"></span>γνῶσις</span>, bred from the intellect, the
mind, and its reason. This latter is not born with men, but must be
gained and by practice formed into a habit. *The initiated* find its
perfection in a loving mysticism, which this never-failing love makes
lasting.”

<span id="vi.iv.i.xxx-p6"></span>So, further, this learned analyst, not
blindly, but always with scientific conscience and judicial
impartiality, expounds his author; and, without some such guide, I
despair of securing the real interest of the youthful student. Butler’s
*Analogy* and Aristotle’s *Ethics* are always analyzed for learners, by
editors of their works; and hence I have ventured to direct attention to
this “guide, philosopher, and friend” of my own inquiries. <span
id="fr_2143"></span>[2144](#fn_2143.md)

##### <span id="vi.iv.i.xxx-p7.1"></span>II.

<span id="vi.iv.i.xxx-p8"></span>(Pantænus and His School. <span
id="fr_2144"></span>[2145](#fn_2144) .md)

<span id="vi.iv.i.xxx-p10"></span>The catechetical school at Alexandria
was already ancient; for Eusebius describes it as <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.iv.i.xxx-p10.1"></span>ἐξ ἀρχαίου
ἔθους</span>and St. Jerome dates its origin from the first planting of
Christianity. Many things conspired to make this city the very head of
Catholic Christendom, at this time; for the whole <span id="page_343">p.
343</span> <span id="vi.iv.i.xxx-Page_343"></span>East centred here, and
the East was Christendom while the West was yet a missionary field
almost entirely. Demetrius, then bishop, at the times with which we are
now concerned, sent Pantænus to convert the Hindoos, and, whatever his
success or failure there, he brought back reports that Christians were
there before him, the offspring of St. Bartholomew’s preaching; and, in
proof thereof, he brought with him a copy of St. Matthew’s Gospel in the
Hebrew tongue <span id="fr_2145"></span>[2146](#fn_2145.md) which became
one of the treasures of the church on the Nile.

<span id="vi.iv.i.xxx-p12"></span>But it deserves note, that, because of
the learning concentrated in this place, the bishops of Alexandria were,
from the beginning, the great authorities as to the Easter cycle and the
annual computation of Easter, which new created the science of astronomy
as one result. The Council of Nice, in settling the laws for the
observance of the Feast of the Resurrection, extended the function of
the Alexandrian See in this respect; for it was charged with the duty of
giving notice of the day when Easter should fall every year, to all the
churches. And easily might an ambitious primate of Egypt have imagined
himself superior to all other bishops at that time; for, as Bingham
observes, <span id="fr_2146"></span>[2147](#fn_2146.md) he was the greatest
in the world, “for the absoluteness of his power, and the extent of his
jurisdiction.” And this greatness of Alexandria was *ancient,* we must
remember, at the Nicene epoch; for their celebrated canon (VI.) reads,
“*Let ancient customs prevail;* so that in Egypt, Lybia, and Pentapolis,
the Bishop of Alexandria shall have power over all these.” Similar
powers and privileges, over their own regions, were recognised in Rome
and Antioch.

##### <span id="vi.iv.i.xxx-p13.1"></span>III.

<span id="vi.iv.i.xxx-p14"></span>(Tradition. <span
id="fr_2147"></span>[2148](#fn_2147) .md)

<span id="vi.iv.i.xxx-p16"></span>The apostles distinguish between vain
traditions of the Jews, and their own Christian <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.iv.i.xxx-p16.1"></span>παραδόσεις</span>the
*tradita apostolica* ([2 Tim. 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#013.md),
[14](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#014.md)<span
id="vi.iv.i.xxx-p16.2"></span>; [2 Tim. ii.
2](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#002.md)<span id="vi.iv.i.xxx-p16.3"></span>;
[1 Cor. xi. 2](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#002.md)<span
id="vi.iv.i.xxx-p16.4"></span>; [2 Thess. iii.
6](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#006.md)<span id="vi.iv.i.xxx-p16.5"></span>;
[1 Cor. v. 8](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#008.md)<span
id="vi.iv.i.xxx-p16.6"></span>; [1 Cor. xvi.
2](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#002.md)<span
id="vi.iv.i.xxx-p16.7"></span>). Among these were (1) the authentication
of their own Scriptures; (2) certain “forms of sound words,” afterwards
digested into liturgies; (3) the rules for celebrating the Lord’s
Supper, and of administering baptism; (4) the Christian Passover and the
weekly Lord’s Day; (5) the Jewish Sabbath and ordinances, how far to be
respected while the temple yet stood; (6) the kiss of charity, and other
observances of public worship; (7) the *agapæ*, the rules about widows,
etc.

<span id="vi.iv.i.xxx-p17"></span>In some degree these were the secret
of the Church, with which “strangers intermeddled not” lawfully. The
Lord’s Supper was celebrated after the catechumens and mere hearers had
withdrawn, and nobody was suffered to be present without receiving the
sacrament. But, after the conversion of the empire, the canons and
constitutions universally dispersed made public all these *tradita;* and
the liturgies also were everywhere made known. It is idle, therefore, to
shelter under theories of the *Disciplina Arcani*, those Middle-Age
inventions, of which antiquity shows no trace but in many ways
contradicts emphatically; e.g., the Eucharist, celebrated after the
withdrawal of the non-communicants, and received, in both kinds, by all
present, cannot be pleaded as the “secret” which justifies a ceremony in
an unknown tongue and otherwise utterly different; in which the priest
alone partakes, in which the cup is denied to the laity and which is
exhibited with great pomp before all comers with no general
participation.

##### <span id="vi.iv.i.xxx-p17.1"></span>IV.

<span id="vi.iv.i.xxx-p18"></span>(Esoteric Doctrine. <span
id="fr_2148"></span>[2149](#fn_2148) .md)

<span id="vi.iv.i.xxx-p20"></span>Early Christians, according to
Clement, taught to all alike, (1) all things necessary to salvation, (2)
all the whole Scriptures, and (3) all the apostolic traditions. This is
evident from passages <span id="page_344">p. 344</span> <span
id="vi.iv.i.xxx-Page_344"></span>noted here and hereafter. But, in the
presence of the heathen, they remembered our Lord’s words, and were
careful not “to cast pearls before swine.” Like St. Paul before Felix,
they “reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come,” when
dealing with men who knew not God, preaching Christ to them in a
practical way. In their instructions to the churches, they were able to
say with the same apostle, “I am pure from the blood of all men, for I
have not shunned to declare unto you *all the counsel of God*.” Yet,
even in the Church, they fed babes with milk, and the more intelligent
with the meat of God’s word. What that meat was, we discover in the
*Stromata*, when our author defines the true Gnostic, who follows
whithersoever God leads him in *the divinely inspired Scriptures*. He
recognises many who merely taste the Scriptures as *believers;* but the
true Gnostic is a *gnomon* of truth, an index to others of the whole
knowledge of Christ.

<span id="vi.iv.i.xxx-p21"></span>What we teach children in the Sunday
school, and what we teach young men in the theological seminary, must
illustrate the two ideas; the same truths to babes in element, but to
men in all their bearings and relations.

<span id="vi.iv.i.xxx-p22"></span>The defenders of the modern creed of
Pius the Fourth (<span class="sc"><span
id="vi.iv.i.xxx-p22.1"></span>a.d.</span> 1564), finding no authority in
Holy Scripture for most of its peculiarities, which are all imposed as
requisite to salvation as if it were the Apostles’ Creed itself,
endeavour to support them, by asserting that they belonged to the secret
teaching of the early Church, of which they claim Clement as a witness.
But the fallacy is obvious. Either they were thus *secreted*, or they
were not. If not, as is most evident (because they contradict what was
openly professed), then no ground for the pretence. But suppose they
were, what follows? Such secrets were no part of the faith, and could
not become so at a later period. If they were kept secret by the new
theologians, and taught to “Gnostics” only, they would still be without
primitive example, but might be less objectionable. But, no! they are
imposed upon all, as if part of the ancient creeds; imposed, as if
articles of the Catholic faith, on the most illiterate peasant, whose
mere *doubt* as to any of them excludes him from the Church here, and
from salvation hereafter. Such, then, is a fatal departure from Catholic
orthodoxy and the traditions of the ancients. The whole system is a
novelty, and the product of the most barren and corrupt period of
Occidental history.

<span id="vi.iv.i.xxx-p23"></span>The Church, as Clement shows, never
made any *secret* of any article of the Christian faith; and, as soon as
she was free from persecution, the whole testimony of the Ante-Nicene
Fathers was summed up in the Nicæno-Constantinopolitan Confession. This
only is the Catholic faith, and the council forbade any additions
thereto, in the way of a symbol. See Professor Shedd’s *Christian
Doctrine*, vol. ii. p. 438. Ed. 1864, New York.

##### <span id="vi.iv.i.xxx-p23.1"></span>V.

<span id="vi.iv.i.xxx-p24"></span>(p. 302, note 9, Elucidation III.,
continued.)

<span id="vi.iv.i.xxx-p25"></span>This is a valuable passage for the
illustration of our author’s views of the nature of tradition, (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.iv.i.xxx-p25.1"></span>κατὰ τὸν σεμνὸν τῆς
παραδόσεως κανόνα</span> as a canon “from the creation of the world;” a
tradition preluding the tradition of true knowledge; a divine mystery
preparing for the knowledge of mysteries,—clearing the ground from
thorns and weeds, beforehand, so that the seed of the Word may not be
choked. Now, in this tradition, he includes a true idea of Gentilism as
well as of the Hebrew Church and its covenant relations; in short,
whatever a Christian scholar is obliged to learn from “Antiquities” and
“Introductions” and “Bible Dictionaries,” authenticated by universal and
orthodox approbation. These are the providential provisions of the
Divine Œconomy, for the communication of truth. Dr. Watts has a sermon
on the *Inward Witness to Christianity*, which I find quoted by
Vicesimus Knox (Works, vol. vii. p. 73, *et seqq.*) in a choice passage
that forcibly expands and expounds some of Clement’s suggestions, though
without referring to our author.

<span id="page_345">p. 345</span> <span
id="vi.iv.i.xxx-Page_345"></span>

##### <span id="vi.iv.i.xxx-p25.2"></span>VI.

<span id="vi.iv.i.xxx-p26"></span>(Justification, p. 305 note 7.)

<span id="vi.iv.i.xxx-p27"></span>Without reference to my own views on
this great subject, and desiring merely to illustrate our author, it
shall suffice to remark, here, that to suppose that Clement uses the
word *technically*, as we now use the language of the schools and of
post-Reformation theologians, would hopelessly confuse the argument of
our author. It is clear that he has no idea of any justification apart
from the merits of Christ: but he uses the term loosely to express his
idea, that as the Law led the Hebrews to the great Healer, who rose from
the dead for our justification, in that sense, and in no other, *the
truth* that was to be found in Greek Philosophy, although a *minimum*,
did the same for heathen who loved truth, and followed it so far as they
knew. Whether his views even in this were correct, it would not become
me, here, to express any opinion. (See below, Elucidation XIV.)

##### <span id="vi.iv.i.xxx-p27.1"></span>VII.

<span id="vi.iv.i.xxx-p28"></span>(Philosophy, p. 305, note 8.)

<span id="vi.iv.i.xxx-p29"></span>It is so important to grasp just what
our author understands by this “philosophy,” that I had designed to
introduce, here, a long passage from Bishop Kaye’s lucid exposition.
Finding, however, that these elucidations are already, perhaps, over
multiplied, I content myself with a reference to his *Account*, etc.
(pp. 118–121).

##### <span id="vi.iv.i.xxx-p29.1"></span>VIII.

<span id="vi.iv.i.xxx-p30"></span>(Overflow of the Spirit, p. 306, note
1.)

<span id="vi.iv.i.xxx-p31"></span>Here, again, I wished to introduce
textual citations from several eminent authors: I content myself with a
very short one from Kaye, to illustrate the intricacy, not to say the
contradictory character, of some of Clement’s positions as to the extent
of grace bestowed on the heathen. “Clement says that an act, to be
right, must be done through the love of God. He says that every action
of the heathen is sinful, since it is not sufficient that an action is
right: *its object or aim must also be right*” (*Account,* etc., p.
426). For a most interesting, but I venture to think overdrawn,
statement of St. Paul’s position as to heathen “wisdom,” etc., see
Farrar’s *Life of St. Paul* (p. 20, *et seqq.,* ed. New York). Without
relying on this popular author, I cannot but refer the reader to his
*Hulsean Lecture* (1870, p. 135, *et seqq.*).

##### <span id="vi.iv.i.xxx-p31.1"></span>IX.

<span id="vi.iv.i.xxx-p32"></span>(Faith without Learning, p. 307, note
5.)

<span id="vi.iv.i.xxx-p33"></span>The compassion of Christ for poverty,
misery, for childhood, and for ignorance, is everywhere illustrated in
Holy Scripture; and *faith*, even “as a grain of mustard seed,” is
magnified, accordingly, in the infinite love of his teaching. Again I am
willing to refer to Farrar (though I read him always with something
between the lines, before I can adopt his sweeping generalizations) for
a fine passage, I should quote entire, did space permit (*The Witness of
History to Christ*, p. 172, ed. London, 1872). See also the noble sermon
of Jeremy Taylor on [John vii. 17](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#017.md)<span
id="vi.iv.i.xxx-p33.1"></span> (*Works*, vol. ii. p. 53, ed. Bohn,
1844).

##### <span id="vi.iv.i.xxx-p33.2"></span>X.

<span id="vi.iv.i.xxx-p34"></span>(The Open Secret, p. 313, note 3.)

<span id="vi.iv.i.xxx-p35"></span>The esoteric system of Clement is here
expounded in few words: there is nothing in it which may not be
proclaimed from the house-tops, for all who have ears to hear. It is the
mere swine (with seed-pickers and jack-daws, the <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.iv.i.xxx-p35.1"></span>σπερμόλογοι</span> of
the Athenians) who must be denied the pearls of gnostic truth. And this,
on the same merciful principle on which the Master was silent before
Pilate, and turned away from cities where they were not prepared to
receive his message.

<span id="page_346">p. 346</span> <span
id="vi.iv.i.xxx-Page_346"></span>

##### <span id="vi.iv.i.xxx-p35.2"></span>XI.

<span id="vi.iv.i.xxx-p36"></span>(Bodily Purity, p. 317, note 1.)

<span id="vi.iv.i.xxx-p37"></span>From a familiar quotation, I have
often argued that the fine instinct of a woman, even among heathen,
enforces a true idea: “If from her husband’s bed, as soon as she has
bathed: if from adulterous commerce, not at all.” This is afterwards
noted by our author; <span id="fr_2149"></span>[2150](#fn_2149.md) but it
is extraordinary to find the mind of the great missionary to our Saxon
forefathers, troubled about such questions, even in the seventh century.
I have less admiration for the elaborate answers of the great Patriarch
of Rome (Gregory), to the scrupulous inquiries of Augustine, than for
the instinctive and aphoristic wisdom of poor Theano, in all the
darkness of her heathenism. (See Ven. Bede, *Eccles. Hist.*, book i.
cap. 27, p. 131. Works, ed. London, 1843.)

##### <span id="vi.iv.i.xxx-p38.1"></span>XII.

<span id="vi.iv.i.xxx-p39"></span>(Clement’s View of Philosophy, p. 318,
note 4.)

<span id="vi.iv.i.xxx-p40"></span>I note the concluding words of this
chapter (xvi.), as epitomizing the whole of what Clement means to say on
this great subject; and, for more, see the Elucidation *infra*, on
Justification.

##### <span id="vi.iv.i.xxx-p40.1"></span>XIII.

<span id="vi.iv.i.xxx-p41"></span>(The Ecstacy of Sibyl, etc., p. 319,
note 3.)

<span id="vi.iv.i.xxx-p42"></span>No need to quote Virgil’s description
(*Æneid,* vi. 46, with Heyne’s references in Excursus V.); but I would
compare with his picture of Sibylline inspiration, that of Balaam ([Num.
24:3](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#003.md),
[4](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#004.md),
[15](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#015.md),
[16](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#016.md)<span
id="vi.iv.i.xxx-p42.1"></span>), and leave with the student an inquiry,
how far we may credit to a divine motion, the oracles of the heathen,
i.e., some of them. I wish to refer the student, also, as to a valuable
bit of introductory learning, to the essay of Isaac Casaubon
(*Exercitationes ad Baronii Prolegom.*, pp. 65–85, ed. Genevæ, 1663).

##### <span id="vi.iv.i.xxx-p42.2"></span>XIV.

<span id="vi.iv.i.xxx-p43"></span>(Justification, p. 323, note 2.)

<span id="vi.iv.i.xxx-p44"></span>Casaubon, in the work just quoted
above (*Exercitat.*, i.) examines this passage of our author, and
others, comparing them with passages from St. Chrysostom and St.
Augustine, and with Justin Martyr (see vol. i. p. 178, this series, cap.
46). Bishop Kaye (p. 428) justly remarks: “The apparent incorrectness of
Clement’s language arises from not making that clear distinction which
the controversies at the time of the Reformation introduced.” The word
“incorrectness,” though for myself I do not object to it, might be said
“to beg the question;” and hence I should prefer to leave it open to the
divers views of readers, by speaking, rather, of his lack of *precision*
in the use of a term not then defined with theological delicacy of
statement.

##### <span id="vi.iv.i.xxx-p44.1"></span>XV.

<span id="vi.iv.i.xxx-p45"></span>(Chronology, p. 334, note 5.)

<span id="vi.iv.i.xxx-p46"></span>Here an invaluable work for comparison
and reference must be consulted by the student; viz., the *Chronicon* of
Julius Africanus, in Routh’s *Reliquiæ* (tom ii. p. 220, *et seqq*.),
with learned annotations, in which (e.g., p. 491) Clement’s work is
cited. Africanus took up chronological science in the imperfect state
where it was left by Clement, with whom he was partially contemporary;
for he was Bishop of Emmaus in Palestine (called also Nicopolis), and
composed his fine books of chronological history, under Marcus
Aurelius. <span id="fr_2150"></span>[2151](#fn_2150.md) On the Alexandrian
era consult a paragraph in *Encyc. Britannica* (vol. v. p. 714). It was
adopted for Christian computation, after Africanus. See Eusebius (book
vi. cap. 31), and compare (this volume, p. 85) what is said of
Theophilus of Antioch, by Abp. Usher. <span
