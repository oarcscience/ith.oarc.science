##### <span id="vi.iv.iv.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.—The True Excellence of Man.

<span id="vi.iv.iv.iii-p1"></span>The most of men have a disposition
unstable and heedless, like the nature of storms. “Want of faith has
done many good things, and faith evil things.” And Epicharmus says,
“Don’t forget to exercise incredulity; for it is the sinews of the
soul.” Now, to disbelieve truth brings death, as to believe, life; and
again, to believe the lie and to disbelieve the truth hurries to
destruction. The same is the case with self-restraint and
licentiousness. To restrain one’s self from doing good is the work of
vice; but to keep from wrong is the beginning of salvation. So the
Sabbath, by abstinence from evils, seems to indicate self-restraint. And
what, I ask, is it in which man differs from beasts, and the angels of
God, on the other hand, are wiser than he? “Thou madest him a little
lower than the angels.” <span id="fr_2681"></span>[2682](#fn_2681.md) For
some do not interpret this Scripture of the Lord, although He also bore
flesh, but of the perfect man and the gnostic, inferior in comparison
with the angels in time, and by reason of the vesture \[of the body\]. I
call then wisdom nothing but science, since life differs not from life.
For to live is common to the mortal nature, that is to man, with that to
which has been vouchsafed immortality; as also the faculty of
contemplation and of self-restraint, one of the two being more
excellent. On this ground Pythagoras seems to me to have said that God
alone is wise, since also the apostle writes in the Epistle to the
Romans, “For the obedience of the faith among all nations, being made
known to the only wise God through Jesus Christ;” <span
id="fr_2682"></span>[2683](#fn_2682.md) and that he himself was a
philosopher, on account of his friendship with God. Accordingly it is
said, “God talked with Moses as a friend with a friend.” <span
id="fr_2683"></span>[2684](#fn_2683.md) That, then, which is true being
clear to God, forthwith generates truth. And the gnostic loves the
truth. “Go,” it is said, “to the ant, thou sluggard, and be the disciple
of the bee;” thus speaks Solomon. <span
id="fr_2684"></span>[2685](#fn_2684.md) For if there is one function
belonging to the peculiar nature of each creature, alike of the ox, and
horse, and dog, what shall we say is the peculiar function of man? He is
like, it appears to me, the Centaur, a Thessalian figment, compounded of
a rational and irrational part, of soul and body. Well, the body tills
the ground, and hastes to it; but the soul is raised to God: trained in
the true philosophy, it speeds to its kindred above, turning away from
the lusts of the body, and besides these, from toil and fear, although
we have shown that patience and fear belong to the good man. For if “by
the law is the knowledge of sin,” <span
id="fr_2685"></span>[2686](#fn_2685.md) as those allege who disparage the
law, and “till the law sin was in the world;” <span
id="fr_2686"></span>[2687](#fn_2686.md) yet “without the law sin was
dead,” <span id="fr_2687"></span>[2688](#fn_2687.md) we oppose them. For
when you take away the cause of fear, sin, you have taken away fear; and
much more, punishment, when you have taken away that which gives rise to
lust. “For the law is not made for the just <span id="page_411">p.
411</span> <span id="vi.iv.iv.iii-Page_411"></span>man,” <span
id="fr_2688"></span>[2689](#fn_2688.md) says the Scripture. Well, then,
says Heraclitus, “They would not have known the name of Justice if these
things had not been.” And Socrates says, “that the law was not made for
the sake of the good.” But the cavillers did not know even this, as the
apostle says, “that he who loveth his brother worketh not evil;” for
this, “Thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not commit adultery, thou shalt
not steal; and if there be any other commandment, it is comprehended in
the word, Thou shall love thy neighbour as thyself.” <span
id="fr_2689"></span>[2690](#fn_2689.md) So also is it said, “Thou shall
love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and thou shalt love thy
neighbour as thyself.” <span id="fr_2690"></span>[2691](#fn_2690.md) And
“if he that loveth his neighbour worketh no evil,” and if “every
commandment is comprehended in this, the loving our neighbour,” the
commandments, by menacing with fear, work love, not hatred. Wherefore
the law is productive of the emotion of fear. “So that the law is holy,”
and in truth “spiritual,” <span id="fr_2691"></span>[2692](#fn_2691.md)
according to the apostle. We must, then, as is fit, in investigating the
nature of the body and the essence of the soul, apprehend the end of
each, and not regard death as an evil. “For when ye were the servants of
sin,” says the apostle, “ye were free from righteousness. What fruit had
ye then in those things in which ye are now ashamed? For the end of
those things is death. But now, being made free from sin, and become
servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end
everlasting life. For the wages of sin is death: but the gift of God is
eternal life, through Jesus Christ our Lord.” <span
id="fr_2692"></span>[2693](#fn_2692.md) The assertion, then, may be
hazarded, that it has been shown that death is the fellowship of the
soul in a state of sin with the body; and life the separation from sin.
And many are the stakes and ditches of lust which impede us, and the
pits of wrath and anger which must be overleaped, and all the
machinations we must avoid of those who plot against us,—who would no
longer see the knowledge of God “through a glass.”

> <span id="vi.iv.iv.iii-p13.2"></span> “The half of virtue the
> far-seeing Zeus takes  
> From man, when he reduces him to a state of slavery.”  

<span id="vi.iv.iv.iii-p14"></span>As slaves the Scripture views those
“under sin” and “sold to sin,” the lovers of pleasure and of the body;
and beasts rather than men, “those who have become like to cattle,
horses, neighing after their neighbours’ wives.” <span
id="fr_2693"></span>[2694](#fn_2693.md) The licentious is “the lustful
ass,” the covetous is the “savage wolf,” and the deceiver is “a
serpent.” The severance, therefore, of the soul from the body, made a
life-long study, produces in the philosopher gnostic alacrity, so that
he is easily able to bear natural death, which is the dissolution of the
chains which bind the soul to the body. “For the world is crucified to
me, and I to the world,” the \[apostle\] says; “and now I live, though
in the flesh, as having my conversation in heaven.” <span
