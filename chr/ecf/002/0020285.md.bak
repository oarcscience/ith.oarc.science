##### <span id="vi.iii.iii.vii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VII.—Frugality a Good Provision for the Christian.

<span id="vi.iii.iii.vii-p1"></span>Delicacies spent on pleasures become
a dangerous shipwreck to men; for this voluptuous and ignoble life of
the many is alien to true love for the beautiful and to refined
pleasures. For man is by nature an erect and majestic being, aspiring
after the good as becomes the creature of the One. But the life which
crawls on its belly is destitute of dignity, is scandalous, hateful,
ridiculous. And to the divine nature voluptuousness is a thing most
alien; for this is for a man to be like sparrows in feeding, and swine
and goats in lechery. For to regard pleasure as a good thing, is the
sign of utter ignorance of what is excellent. Love of wealth displaces a
man from the right mode of life, and induces him to cease from feeling
shame at what is shameful; if only, like a beast, he has power to eat
all sorts of things, and to drink in like manner, and to satiate in
every way his lewd desires. And so very rarely does he inherit the
kingdom of God. For what end, then, are such dainty dishes prepared, but
to fill one belly? The filthiness of gluttony is proved by the sewers
into which our bellies discharge the refuse of our food. For what end do
they collect so many cupbearers, when they might satisfy themselves with
one cup? For what the chests of clothes? and the gold ornaments for
what? Those things are prepared for clothes-stealers, and scoundrels,
and for greedy eyes. “But let alms and faith not fail thee,” <span
id="fr_1637"></span>[1638](#fn_1637.md) says the Scripture.

<span id="page_281">p. 281</span> <span
id="vi.iii.iii.vii-Page_281"></span>

<span id="vi.iii.iii.vii-p3"></span>Look, for instance, to Elias the
Thesbite, in whom we have a beautiful example of frugality, when he sat
down beneath the thorn, and the angel brought him food. “It was a cake
of barley and a jar of water.” <span
id="fr_1638"></span>[1639](#fn_1638.md) Such the Lord sent as best for him.
We, then, on our journey to the truth, must be unencumbered. “Carry
not,” said the Lord, “purse, nor scrip, nor shoes;” <span
id="fr_1639"></span>[1640](#fn_1639.md) that is, possess not wealth, which
is only treasured up in a purse; fill not your own stores, as if laying
up produce in a bag, but communicate to those who have need. Do not
trouble yourselves about horses and servants, who, as bearing burdens
when the rich are travelling, are allegorically called shoes.

<span id="vi.iii.iii.vii-p6"></span>We must, then, cast away the
multitude of vessels, silver and gold drinking cups, and the crowd of
domestics, receiving as we have done from the Instructor the fair and
grave attendants, Self-help and Simplicity. And we must walk suitably to
the Word; and if there be a wife and children, the house is not a
burden, having learned to change its place along with the sound-minded
traveller. The wife who loves her husband must be furnished for travel
similarly to her husband. A fair provision for the journey to heaven is
theirs who bear frugality with chaste gravity. And as the foot is the
measure of the shoe, so also is the body of what each individual
possesses. But that which is superfluous, what they call ornaments and
the furniture of the rich, is a burden, not an ornament to the body. He
who climbs to the heavens by force, must carry with him the fair staff
of beneficence, and attain to the true rest by communicating to those
who are in distress. For the Scripture avouches, “that the true riches
of the soul are a man’s ransom,” <span
id="fr_1640"></span>[1641](#fn_1640.md) that is, if he is rich, he will be
saved by distributing it. For as gushing wells, when pumped out, rise
again to their former measure, <span
id="fr_1641"></span>[1642](#fn_1641.md) so giving away, being the benignant
spring of love, by communicating of its drink to the thirsty, again
increases and is replenished, just as the milk is wont to flow into the
breasts that are sucked or milked. For he who has the almighty God, the
Word, is in want of nothing, and never is in straits for what he needs.
For the Word is a possession that wants nothing, and is the cause of all
abundance. If one say that he has often seen the righteous man in need
of food, this is rare, and happens only where there is not another
righteous man. <span id="fr_1642"></span>[1643](#fn_1642.md)
Notwithstanding let him read what follows: “For the righteous man shall
not live by bread alone, but by the word of the Lord,” <span
id="fr_1643"></span>[1644](#fn_1643.md) who is the true bread, the bread of
the heavens. The good man, then, can never be in difficulties so long as
he keeps intact his confession towards God. For it appertains to him to
ask and to receive whatever he requires from the Father of all; and to
enjoy what is his own, if he keep the Son. And this also appertains to
him, to feel no want.

<span id="vi.iii.iii.vii-p11"></span>This Word, who trains us, confers
on us the true riches. Nor is the growing rich an object of envy to
those who possess through Him the privilege of wanting nothing. He that
has this wealth shall inherit the kingdom of God.
