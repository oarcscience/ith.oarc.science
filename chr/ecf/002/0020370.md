##### <span id="vi.iv.iv.xix-p0.1"></span>Chapter XX.—A Good Wife.

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xix-p1"></span>The woman who, with propriety, loves
her husband, Euripides describes, while admonishing,—

> <span id="vi.iv.iv.xix-p1.1"></span> “That when her husband says
> aught,  
> She ought to regard him as speaking well if she say nothing;  
> And if she will say anything, to do her endeavour to gratify her
> husband.”  

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xix-p2"></span>And again he subjoins the like:—

> <span id="vi.iv.iv.xix-p2.1"></span> “And that the wife should sweetly
> look sad with her husband,  
> Should aught evil befall him,  
> And have in common a share of sorrow and joy.”  

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xix-p3"></span>Then, describing her as gentle and
kind even in misfortunes, he adds:—

> <span id="vi.iv.iv.xix-p3.1"></span> “And I, when you are ill, will,
> sharing your sickness bear it;  
> And I will bear my share in your misfortunes.”  

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xix-p4"></span>And:—

> <span id="vi.iv.iv.xix-p4.1"></span> “Nothing is bitter to me,  
> For with friends one ought to be happy,  
> For what else is friendship but this?”  

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xix-p5"></span>The marriage, then, that is
consummated according to the word, is sanctified, if the union be under
subjection to God, and be conducted “with a true heart, in full
assurance of faith, having hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and
the body washed with pure water, and holding the confession of hope; for
He is faithful that promised.” And the happiness of marriage ought never
to be estimated either by wealth or beauty, but by virtue.

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xix-p6"></span>“Beauty,” says the tragedy,—

> <span id="vi.iv.iv.xix-p6.1"></span> “Helps no wife with her
> husband;  
> But virtue has helped many; for every good wife  
> Who is attached to her husband knows how to practice sobriety.”  

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xix-p7"></span>Then, as giving admonitions, he says:—

> <span id="vi.iv.iv.xix-p7.1"></span> “First, then, this is incumbent
> on her who is endowed with mind,  
> That even if her husband be ugly, he must appear good-looking;  
> For it is for the mind, not the eye, to judge.”  

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xix-p8"></span>And so forth.

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xix-p9"></span>For with perfect propriety Scripture
has said that woman is given by God as “an help” to man. It is evident,
then, in my opinion, that she will charge herself with remedying, by
good sense and persuasion, each of the annoyances that originate with
her husband in domestic economy. And if he do not yield, then she will
endeavour, as far as possible for human nature, to lead a sinless life;
whether it be necessary to die, in accordance with reason, or to live;
considering that God is her helper and associate in such a course of
conduct, her true defender and Saviour both for the present and for the
future; making Him the leader and guide of all her actions, reckoning
sobriety and righteousness her work, and making the favour of God her
end. Gracefully, therefore, the apostle says in the Epistle to Titus,
“that the elder women should be of godly behaviour, should not be
slanderers, not enslaved to much wine; that they should counsel the
young women to be lovers of their husbands, lovers of their children,
discreet, chaste, housekeepers, good, subject to their own husbands;
that the word of God be not blasphemed.” <span
id="fr_2867"></span>[2868](#fn_2867) But rather, he says, “Follow peace
with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord:
looking diligently, lest there be any fornicator or profane person, as
Esau, who for one morsel surrendered his birth-right; and lest any root
of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be
defiled.” <span id="fr_2868"></span>[2869](#fn_2868) And then, as
putting the finishing stroke to the question about marriage, he adds:
“Marriage is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but whoremongers
and adulterers God will judge.” <span
id="fr_2869"></span>[2870](#fn_2869) <span id="page_433">p. 433</span>
<span id="vi.iv.iv.xix-Page_433"></span>And one aim and one end, as far
as regards perfection, being demonstrated to belong to the man and the
woman, Peter in his Epistle says, “Though now for a season, if need be,
ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations; that the trial of your
faith, being much more precious than that of gold which perisheth,
though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise, and honour,
and glory at the revelation of Jesus Christ; whom, having not seen, ye
love; in whom, though now ye see Him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with
joy unspeakable, and full of glory, receiving the end of your faith, the
salvation of your souls.” <span id="fr_2870"></span>[2871](#fn_2870)
Wherefore also Paul rejoices for Christ’s sake that he was “in labours,
more abundantly, in stripes above measure, in deaths oft.” <span
id="fr_2871"></span>[2872](#fn_2871)
