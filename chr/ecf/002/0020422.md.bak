<span id="vi.iv.vii.xii"></span>

##### <span id="vi.iv.vii.xii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XII.—The True Gnostic is Beneficent, Continent, and Despises Worldly Things.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xii-p1"></span>Let these things, then, be so. And
such being the attitude of the Gnostic towards the body and the
soul—towards his neighbours, whether it be a domestic, or a lawful
enemy, or whosoever—he is found equal and like. For he does not “despise
his brother,” who, according to the divine law, is of the same father
and mother. Certainly he relieves the afflicted, helping him with
consolations, encouragements, and the necessaries of life; giving to all
that need, though not similarly, but justly, according to desert;
furthermore, to him who persecutes and hates, even if he need it; caring
little for those who say to him that he has given out of fear, if it is
not out of fear that he does so, but to give help. For how much more are
those, who towards their enemies are devoid of love of money, and are
haters of evil, animated with love to those who belong to them?

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xii-p2"></span>Such an one from this proceeds to the
accurate knowledge of whom he ought chiefly to give to, and how much,
and when, and how.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xii-p3"></span>And who could with any reason become
the enemy of a man who gives no cause for enmity in any way? And is it
not just as in the case of God? We say that God is the adversary of no
one, and the enemy of no one (for He is the Creator of all, and nothing
that exists is what He wills it not to be; but we assert that the
disobedient, and those who walk not according to His commandments, are
enemies to Him, as being those who are hostile to His covenant). <span
id="page_543">p. 543</span> <span id="vi.iv.vii.xii-Page_543"></span>We
shall find the very same to be the case with the Gnostic, for he can
never in any way become an enemy to any one; but those may be regarded
enemies to him who turn to the contrary path.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xii-p4"></span>In particular, the habit of
liberality <span id="fr_3605"></span>[3606](#fn_3605.md) which prevails
among us is called “righteousness;” but the power of discriminating
according to desert, as to greater and less, with reference to those who
am proper subjects of it, is a form of the very highest righteousness.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xii-p6"></span>There are things practiced in a
vulgar style by some people, such as control over pleasures. For as,
among the heathen, there are those who, from the impossibility of
obtaining what one sees, <span id="fr_3606"></span>[3607](#fn_3606.md) and
from fear of men, and also for the sake of greater pleasures, abstain
from the delights that are before them; so also, in the case of faith,
some practice self-restraint, either out of regard to the promise or
from fear of God. Well, such self-restraint is the basis of knowledge,
and an approach to something better, and an effort after perfection. For
“the fear of the Lord,” it is said, “is the beginning of wisdom.” <span
id="fr_3607"></span>[3608](#fn_3607.md) But the perfect man, out of love,
“beareth all things, endureth all things,” <span
id="fr_3608"></span>[3609](#fn_3608.md) “as not pleasing man, but
God.” <span id="fr_3609"></span>[3610](#fn_3609.md) Although praise follows
him as a consequence, it is not for his own advantage, but for the
imitation and benefit of those who praise him.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xii-p11"></span>According to another view, it is not
he who merely controls his passions that is called a continent man, but
he who has also achieved the mastery over good things, and has acquired
surely the great accomplishments of science, from which he produces as
fruits the activities of virtue. Thus the Gnostic is never, on the
occurrence of an emergency, dislodged from the habit peculiar to him.
For the scientific possession of what is good is firm and unchangeable,
being the knowledge of things divine and human. Knowledge, then, never
becomes ignorance nor does good change into evil. Wherefore also he
eats, and drinks, and marries, not as principal ends of existence, but
as necessary. I name marriage even, if the Word prescribe, and as is
suitable. For having become perfect, he <span
id="fr_3610"></span>[3611](#fn_3610.md) has the apostles for examples; and
one is not really shown to be a man in the choice of single life; but he
surpasses men, who, disciplined by marriage, procreation of children,
and care for the house, without pleasure or pain, in his solicitude for
the house has been inseparable from God’s love, and withstood all
temptation arising through children, and wife, and domestics, and
possessions. But he that has no family is in a great degree free of
temptation. Caring, then, for himself alone, he is surpassed by him who
is inferior, as far as his own personal salvation is concerned, but who
is superior in the conduct of life, preserving certainly, in his care
for the truth, a minute image.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xii-p13"></span>But we must as much as possible
subject the soul to varied preparatory exercise, that it may become
susceptible to the reception of knowledge. Do you not see how wax is
softened and copper purified, in order to receive the stamp applied to
it? Just as death is the separation of the soul from the body, so is
knowledge as it were the rational death urging the spirit away, and
separating it from the passions, and leading it on to the life of
well-doing, that it may then say with confidence to God, “I live as Thou
wishest.” For he who makes it his purpose to please men cannot please
God, since the multitude choose not what is profitable, but what is
pleasant. But in pleasing God, one as a consequence gets the favour of
the good among men. How, then, can what relates to meat, and drink, and
amorous pleasure, be agreeable to such an one? since he views with
suspicion even a word that produces pleasure, and a pleasant movement
and act of the mind. “For no one can serve two masters, God and
Mammon,” <span id="fr_3611"></span>[3612](#fn_3611.md) it is said; meaning
not simply money, but the resources arising from money bestowed on
various pleasures. In reality, it is not possible for him who
magnanimously and truly knows God, to serve antagonistic pleasures.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xii-p15"></span>There is one alone, then, who from
the beginning was free of concupiscence—the philanthropic Lord, who for
us became man. And whosoever endeavour to be assimilated to the impress
given by Him, strive, from exercise, to become free of concupiscence.
For he who has exercised concupiscence and then restrained himself, is
like a widow who becomes again a virgin by continence. Such is the
reward of knowledge, rendered to the Saviour and Teacher, which He
Himself asked for,—abstinence from what is evil, activity in doing good,
by which salvation is acquired.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xii-p16"></span>As, then, those who have learned the
arts procure their living by what they have been taught, so also is the
Gnostic saved, procuring life by what he knows. For he who has not
formed the wish to extirpate the passion of the soul, kills himself.
But, as seems, ignorance is the starvation of the soul, and knowledge
its sustenance.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xii-p17"></span>Such are the gnostic souls, which
the Gospel <span id="page_544">p. 544</span> <span
id="vi.iv.vii.xii-Page_544"></span>likened to the consecrated virgins
who wait for the Lord. For they are virgins, in respect of their
abstaining from what is evil. And in respect of their waiting out of
love for the Lord and kindling their light for the contemplation of
things, they are wise souls, saying, “Lord, for long we have desired to
receive Thee; we have lived according to what Thou hast enjoined,
transgressing none of Thy commandments. Wherefore also we claim the
promises. And we pray for what is beneficial, since it is not requisite
to ask of Thee what is most excellent. And we shall take everything for
good; even though the exercises that meet us, which Thine arrangement
brings to us for the discipline of our stedfastness, appear to be evil.”

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xii-p18"></span>The Gnostic, then, from his
exceeding holiness, is better prepared to fail when he asks, than to get
when he does not ask.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xii-p19"></span>His whole life is prayer and
converse with God. <span id="fr_3612"></span>[3613](#fn_3612.md) And if he
be pure from sins, he will by all means obtain what he wishes. For God
says to the righteous man, “Ask, and I will give thee; think, and I will
do.” If beneficial, he will receive it at once; and if injurious, he
will never ask it, and therefore he will not receive it. So it shall be
as he wishes.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xii-p22"></span>But if one say to us, that some
sinners even obtain according to their requests, \[we should say\] that
this rarely takes place, by reason of the righteous goodness of God. And
it is granted to those who are capable of doing others good. Whence the
gift is not made for the sake of him that asked it; but the divine
dispensation, foreseeing that one would be saved by his means, renders
the boon again righteous. And to those who are worthy, things which are
really good are given, even without their asking.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xii-p23"></span>Whenever, then, one is righteous,
not from necessity or out of fear or hope, but from free choice, this is
called the royal road, which the royal race travel. But the byways are
slippery and precipitous. If, then, one take away fear and honour, I do
not know if the illustrious among the philosophers, who use such freedom
of speech, will any longer endure afflictions.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xii-p24"></span>Now lusts and other sins are called
“briars and thorns.” Accordingly the Gnostic labours in the Lord’s
vineyard, planting, pruning, watering; being the divine husbandman of
what is planted in faith. Those, then, who have not done evil, think it
right to receive the wages of ease. But he who has done good out of free
choice, demands the recompense as a good workman. He certainly shall
receive double wages—both for what he has not done, and for what good he
has done.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xii-p25"></span>Such a Gnostic is tempted by no one
except with God’s permission, and that for the benefit of those who are
with him; and he strengthens them for faith, encouraging them by manly
endurance. And assuredly it was for this end, for the establishment and
confirmation of the Churches, that the blessed apostles were brought
into trial and to martyrdom.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xii-p26"></span>The Gnostic, then, hearing a voice
ringing in his ear, which says, “Whom I shall strike, do thou pity,”
beseeches that those who hate him may repent. For the punishment of
malefactors, to be consummated in the highways, is for children to
behold; <span id="fr_3613"></span>[3614](#fn_3613.md) for there is no
possibility of the Gnostic, who has from choice trained himself to be
excellent and good, ever being instructed or delighted with such
spectacles. <span id="fr_3614"></span>[3615](#fn_3614.md) And so, having
become incapable of being softened by pleasures, and never falling into
sins, he is not corrected by the examples of other men’s sufferings. And
far from being pleased with earthly pleasures and spectacles is he who
has shown a noble contempt for the prospects held out in this world,
although they are divine.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xii-p29"></span>“Not every one,” therefore, “that
says Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of God; but he that doeth
the will of God.” <span id="fr_3615"></span>[3616](#fn_3615.md) Such is the
gnostic labourer, who has the mastery of worldly desires even while
still in the flesh; and who, in regard to things future and still
invisible, which he knows, has a sure persuasion, so that he regards
them as more present than the things within reach. This able workman
rejoices in what he knows, but is cramped on account of his being
involved in the necessities of life; not yet deemed worthy of the active
participation in what he knows. So he uses this life as if it belonged
to another,—so far, that is, as is necessary.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xii-p31"></span>He knows also the enigmas of the
fasting of those days <span id="fr_3616"></span>[3617](#fn_3616.md) —I mean
the Fourth and the Preparation. For the one has its name from Hermes,
and the other from Aphrodite. He fasts in his life, in respect of
covetousness and voluptuousness, from which all the vices grow. For we
have already often above shown the three varieties of fornication,
according to the apostle—love of pleasure, love of money, idolatry. He
fasts, then, according to the Law, abstaining from bad deeds, and,
according to the perfection of the Gospel, from evil thoughts.
Temptations are applied to him, not for his purification, but, as we
have said, for the good of his neighbours, <span id="page_545">p.
545</span> <span id="vi.iv.vii.xii-Page_545"></span>if, making trial of
toils and pains, he has despised and passed them by.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xii-p33"></span>The same holds of pleasure. For it
is the highest achievement for one who has had trial of it, afterwards
to abstain. For what great thing is it, if a man restrains himself in
what he knows not? He, in fulfilment of the precept, according to the
Gospel, keeps the Lord’s day, <span id="fr_3617"></span>[3618](#fn_3617.md)
when he abandons an evil disposition, and assumes that of the Gnostic,
glorifying the Lord’s resurrection in himself. Further, also, when he
has received the comprehension of scientific speculation, he deems that
he sees the Lord, directing his eyes towards things invisible, although
he seems to look on what he does not wish to look on; chastising the
faculty of vision, when he perceives himself pleasurably affected by the
application of his eyes; since he wishes to see and hear that alone
which concerns him.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xii-p35"></span>In the act of contemplating the
souls of the brethren, he beholds the beauty of the flesh also, with the
soul itself, which has become habituated to look solely upon that which
is good, without carnal pleasure. And they are really brethren; inasmuch
as, by reason of their elect creation, and their oneness of character,
and the nature of their deeds, they do, and think, and speak the same
holy and good works, in accordance with the sentiments with which the
Lord wished them as elect to be inspired.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xii-p36"></span>For faith shows itself in their
making choice of the same things; and knowledge, in learning and
thinking the same things; and hope, in desiring <span
id="fr_3618"></span>[3619](#fn_3618.md) the same things.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xii-p38"></span>And if, through the necessity of
life, he spend a small portion of time about his sustenance, he thinks
himself defrauded, being diverted by business. <span
id="fr_3619"></span>[3620](#fn_3619.md) Thus not even in dreams does he
look on aught that is unsuitable to an elect man. For thoroughly <span
id="fr_3620"></span>[3621](#fn_3620.md) a stranger and sojourner in the
whole of life is every such one, who, inhabiting the city, despises the
things in the city which are admired by others, and lives in the city as
in a desert, so that the place may not compel him, but his mode of life
show him to be just.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xii-p41"></span>This Gnostic, to speak
compendiously, makes up for the absence of the apostles, by the
rectitude of his life, the accuracy of his knowledge, by benefiting his
relations, by “removing the mountains” of his neighbours, and putting
away the irregularities of their soul. Although each of us is his <span
id="fr_3621"></span>[3622](#fn_3621.md) own vineyard and labourer.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xii-p43"></span>He, too, while doing the most
excellent things, wishes to elude the notice of men, persuading the Lord
along with himself that he is living in accordance with the <span
id="fr_3622"></span>[3623](#fn_3622.md) commandments, preferring these
things from believing them to exist. “For where any one’s mind is, there
also is his treasure.” <span id="fr_3623"></span>[3624](#fn_3623.md)

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xii-p46"></span>He impoverishes himself, in order
that he may never overlook a brother who has been brought into
affliction, through the perfection that is in love, especially if he
know that he will bear want himself easier than his brother. He
considers, accordingly, the other’s pain his own grief; and if, by
contributing from his own indigence in order to do good, he suffer any
hardship, he does not fret at this, but augments his beneficence still
more. For he possesses in its sincerity the faith which is exercised in
reference to the affairs of life, and praises the Gospel in practice and
contemplation. And, in truth, he wins his praise “not from men, but from
God,” <span id="fr_3624"></span>[3625](#fn_3624.md) by the performance of
what the Lord has taught.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xii-p48"></span>He, attracted by his own hope,
tastes not the good things that are in the world, entertaining a noble
contempt for all things here; pitying those that are chastised after
death, who through punishment unwillingly make confession; having a
clear conscience with reference to his departure, and being always
ready, as “a stranger and pilgrim,” with regard to the inheritances
here; mindful only of those that are his own, and regarding all things
here as not his own; not only admiring the Lord’s commandments, but, so
to speak, being by knowledge itself partaker of the divine will; a truly
chosen intimate of the Lord and His commands in virtue of being
righteous; and princely and kingly as being a Gnostic; despising all the
gold on earth and under the earth, and dominion from shore to shore of
ocean, so that he may cling to the sole service of the Lord. Wherefore
also, in eating, and drinking, and marrying (if the Word enjoin), and
even in seeing dreams, <span id="fr_3625"></span>[3626](#fn_3625.md) he
does and thinks what is holy.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xii-p50"></span>So is he always pure for prayer. He
also prays in the society of angels, as being already of angelic rank,
and he is never out of their holy keeping; and though he pray alone, he
has the choir of the saints <span id="fr_3626"></span>[3627](#fn_3626.md)
standing with him.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xii-p52"></span>He recognises a twofold \[element in
faith\], both the activity of him who believes, and the <span
id="page_546">p. 546</span> <span
id="vi.iv.vii.xii-Page_546"></span>excellence of that which is believed
according to its worth; since also righteousness is twofold, that which
is out of love, and that from fear. Accordingly it is said, “The fear of
the <span class="sc"><span id="vi.iv.vii.xii-p52.1"></span>Lord</span>
is pure, remaining for ever and ever.” <span
id="fr_3627"></span>[3628](#fn_3627.md) For those that from fear turn to
faith and righteousness, remain for ever. Now fear works abstinence from
what is evil; but love exhorts to the doing of good, by building up to
the point of spontaneousness; that one may hear from the Lord, “I call
you no longer servants, but friends,” and may now with confidence apply
himself to prayer.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xii-p54"></span>And the form of his prayer is
thanksgiving for the past, for the present, and for the future as
already through faith present. This is preceded by the reception of
knowledge. And he asks to live the allotted life in the flesh as a
Gnostic, as free from the flesh, and to attain to the best things, and
flee from the worse. He asks, too, relief in those things in which we
have sinned, and conversion to the acknowledgment of them. <span
id="fr_3628"></span>[3629](#fn_3628.md)

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xii-p56"></span>He follows, on his departure, Him
who calls, as quickly, so to speak, as He who goes before calls, hasting
by reason of a good conscience to give thanks; and having got there with
Christ shows himself worthy, through his purity, to possess, by a
process of blending, the power of God communicated by Christ. For he
does not wish to be warm by participation in heat, or luminous by
participation in flame, but to be wholly light.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xii-p57"></span>He knows accurately the declaration,
“Unless ye hate father and mother, and besides your own life, and unless
ye bear the sign \[of the cross\].” <span
id="fr_3629"></span>[3630](#fn_3629.md) For he hates the inordinate
affections of the flesh, which possess the powerful spell of pleasure;
and entertains a noble contempt for all that belongs to the creation and
nutriment of the flesh. He also withstands the corporeal <span
id="fr_3630"></span>[3631](#fn_3630.md) soul, putting a bridle-bit on the
restive irrational spirit: “For the flesh lusteth against the
Spirit.” <span id="fr_3631"></span>[3632](#fn_3631.md) And “to bear the
sign of \[the cross\]” is to bear about death, by taking farewell of all
things while still alive; since there is not equal love in “having sown
the flesh,” <span id="fr_3632"></span>[3633](#fn_3632.md) and in having
formed the soul for knowledge.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xii-p62"></span>He having acquired the habit of
doing good, exercises beneficence well, quicker than speaking; praying
that he may get a share in the sins of his brethren, in order to
confession and conversion on the part of his kindred; and eager to give
a share to those dearest to him of his own good things. And so these are
to him, friends. Promoting, then, the growth of the seeds deposited in
him, according to the husbandry enjoined by the Lord, he continues free
of sin, and becomes continent, and lives in spirit with those who are
like him, among the choirs of the saints, though still detained on
earth.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xii-p63"></span>He, all day and night, speaking and
doing the Lord’s commands, rejoices exceedingly, not only on rising in
the morning and at noon, but also when walking about, when asleep, when
dressing and undressing; <span id="fr_3633"></span>[3634](#fn_3633.md) and
he teaches his son, if he has a son. He is inseparable from the
commandment and from hope, and is ever giving thanks to God, like the
living creatures figuratively spoken of by Esaias, and submissive in
every trial, he says, “The <span class="sc"><span
id="vi.iv.vii.xii-p64.1"></span>Lord</span> gave, and the <span
class="sc"><span id="vi.iv.vii.xii-p64.2"></span>Lord</span> hath taken
away.” <span id="fr_3634"></span>[3635](#fn_3634.md) For such also was Job;
who after the spoiling of his effects, along with the health of his
body, resigned all through love to the Lord. For “he was,” it is said,
“just, holy, and kept apart from all wickedness.” <span
id="fr_3635"></span>[3636](#fn_3635.md) Now the word “holy” points out all
duties toward God, and the entire course of life. Knowing which, he was
a Gnostic. For we must neither cling too much to such things, even if
they are good, seeing they are human, nor on the other hand detest them,
if they are bad; but we must be above both \[good and bad\], trampling
the latter under foot, and passing on the former to those who need them.
But the Gnostic is cautious in accommodation, lest he be not perceived,
or lest the accommodation become disposition.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xii-p27"></span> According to the text, instead of
“to behold,” as above, it would be “not to behold.” Lowth suggests the
omission of “not,” (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.vii.xii-p27.1"></span>μή</span>). Retaining it, and
translating “is not even for children to behold,” the clause yields a
suitable sense.
