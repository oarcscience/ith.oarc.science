#### <span id="ii.iv.x-p0.1"></span>Similitude Tenth.

##### <span id="ii.iv.x-p0.2"></span>Concerning Repentance and Alms-Giving.

##### <span id="ii.iv.x-p0.3"></span>Chap. I.

<span id="ii.iv.x-p1"></span>After I had fully written down this book,
that messenger who had delivered me to the Shepherd came into the house
in which I was, and sat down upon a couch, and the Shepherd stood on his
right hand. He then called me, and spoke to me as follows: “I have
delivered you and your house to the Shepherd, that you may be protected
by him.” “Yes, sir,” I said. “If you wish, therefore, to be protected,”
he said, “from all annoyance, and from all harsh treatment, and to have
success in every good work and word, and to possess all the virtues of
righteousness, walk in these commandments which he has given you, and
you will be able to subdue all wickedness. For if you keep those
commandments, every desire and pleasure of the world will be subject to
you, and success will attend you in every good work. Take unto yourself
his experience and moderation, and say to all that he is in great honour
and dignity with God, and that he is a president with great power, and
mighty in his office. To him alone throughout the whole world is the
power of repentance assigned. Does he seem to you to be powerful? But
you despise his experience, and the moderation which he exercises
towards you.”

##### <span id="ii.iv.x-p1.1"></span>Chap. II.

<span id="ii.iv.x-p2"></span>I said to him, “Ask himself, sir, whether
from the time that he has entered my house I have done anything
improper, or have offended him in any respect.” He answered, “I also
know that you neither have done nor will do anything improper, and
therefore I speak these words to you, that you may persevere. For he had
a good report of you to me, and you will say these words to others, that
they also who have either repented or will still repent may entertain
the same feelings with you, and he may report well of these to me, and I
to the Lord.” And I <span id="page_55">p. 55</span> <span
id="ii.iv.x-Page_55"></span>said, “Sir, I make known to every man the
great works of God: and I hope that all those who love them, and have
sinned before, on hearing these words, may repent, and receive life
again.” “Continue, therefore, in this ministry, and finish it. And all
who follow out his commands shall have life, and great honour with the
Lord. <span id="fr_400"></span>[401](#fn_400.md) But those who do not keep
his commandments, flee from his life, and despise him. But he has his
own honour with the Lord. All, therefore, who shall despise him, <span
id="fr_401"></span>[402](#fn_401.md) and not follow his commands, deliver
themselves to death, and every one of them will be guilty of his own
blood. But I enjoin you, that you obey his commands, and you will have a
cure for your former sins.”

##### <span id="ii.iv.x-p4.1"></span>Chap. III.

<span id="ii.iv.x-p5"></span>“Moreover, I sent you these virgins, that
they may dwell with you. <span id="fr_402"></span>[403](#fn_402.md) For I
saw that they were courteous to you. You will therefore have them as
assistants, that you may be the better able to keep his commands: for it
is impossible that these commandments can be observed without these
virgins. I see, moreover, that they abide with you willingly; but I will
also instruct them not to depart at all from your house: do you only
keep your house pure, as they will delight to dwell in a pure abode. For
they are pure, and chaste, and industrious, and have all influence with
the Lord. Therefore, if they find your house to be pure, they will
remain with you; but if any defilement, even a little, befall it, they
will immediately withdraw from your house. For these virgins do not at
all like any defilement.” I said to him, “I hope, sir, that I will
please them, so that they may always be willing to inhabit my house. And
as he to whom you entrusted me has no complaint against me, so neither
will they have.” He said to the Shepherd, “I see that the servant of God
wishes to live, and to keep these commandments, and will place these
virgins in a pure habitation.” <span id="fr_403"></span>[404](#fn_403.md)
When he had spoken these words he again delivered me to the Shepherd,
and called those virgins, and said to them, “Since I see that you are
willing to dwell in his house, I commend him and his house to you,
asking that you withdraw not at all from it.” And the virgins heard
these words with pleasure.

##### <span id="ii.iv.x-p7.2"></span>Chap. IV.

<span id="ii.iv.x-p8"></span>The angel <span
id="fr_404"></span>[405](#fn_404.md) then said to me, “Conduct yourself
manfully in this service, and make known to every one the great things
of God, <span id="fr_405"></span>[406](#fn_405.md) and you will have favour
in this ministry. Whoever, therefore, shall walk in these commandments,
shall have life, and will be happy in his life; but whosoever shall
neglect them shall not have life, and will be unhappy in this life.
Enjoin all, who are able to act rightly, not to cease well-doing; for,
to practice good works is useful to them. <span
id="fr_406"></span>[407](#fn_406.md) And I say that every man ought to be
saved from inconveniences. For both he who is in want, and he who
suffers inconveniences in his daily life, is in great torture and
necessity. Whoever, therefore, rescues a soul of this kind from
necessity, will gain for himself great joy. For he who is harassed by
inconveniences of this kind, suffers equal torture with him who is in
chains. Moreover many, on account of calamities of this sort, when they
could not endure them, hasten their own deaths. Whoever, then, knows a
calamity of this kind afflicting a man, and does not save him, commits a
great sin, and becomes guilty of his blood. <span
id="fr_407"></span>[408](#fn_407.md) Do good works, therefore, ye who have
received good from the Lord; lest, while ye delay to do them, the
building of the tower be finished, and you be rejected from the edifice:
there is now no other tower a-building. For on your account was the work
of building suspended. Unless, then, you make haste to do rightly, the
tower will be completed, and you will be excluded.”

<span id="ii.iv.x-p13"></span>After he had spoken with me he rose up
from the couch, and taking the Shepherd and the virgins, he departed.
But he said to me that he would send back the Shepherd and the virgins
to my dwelling. Amen. <span id="fr_408"></span>[409](#fn_408.md)

the Shepherd, the disciple of the blessed apostle Paul. Thanks be to
God.” The Æthiopic has: “May the name of him who wrote this book be
written on a pillar of gold. With thanksgiving to Father, Son, and Holy
Spirit, this book of the prophet Hermas has been finished. Amen.
Finished are the visions, and commandments, and similitudes of the
prophet Hermas, who is Paul, in the year 191 of mercy, 23d night and 22d
day of the month,” etc. The writer goes on \[fruitlessly\] to show that
Hermas is Paul, appealing to [Acts xiv.
