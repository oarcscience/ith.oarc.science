##### <span id="iv.ii.iii.xxii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXII.—Antiquity of the Temple.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.xxii-p1"></span>Then concerning the building of the
temple in Judæa, which Solomon the king built 566 years after the exodus
of the Jews from Egypt, there is <span id="page_118">p. 118</span> <span
id="iv.ii.iii.xxii-Page_118"></span>among the Tyrians a record how the
temple was built; and in their archives writings have been preserved, in
which the temple is proved to have existed 143 <span
id="fr_681"></span>[682](#fn_681.md) years 8 months before the Tyrians
founded Carthage (and this record was made by Hiram <span
id="fr_682"></span>[683](#fn_682.md) (that is the name of the king of the
Tyrians), the son of Abimalus, on account of the hereditary friendship
which existed between Hiram and Solomon, and at the same time on account
of the surpassing wisdom possessed by Solomon. For they continually
engaged with each other in discussing difficult problems. And proof of
this exists in their correspondence, which to this day is preserved
among the Tyrians, and the writings that passed between them); as
Menander the Ephesian, while narrating the history of the Tyrian
kingdom, records, speaking thus: “For when Abimalus the king of the
Tyrians died, his son Hiram succeeded to the kingdom. He lived 53 years.
And Bazorus succeeded him, who lived 43, and reigned 17 years. And after
him followed Methuastartus, who lived 54 years, and reigned 12. And
after him succeeded his brother Atharymus, who lived 58 years, and
reigned 9. He was slain by his brother of the name of Helles, who lived
50 years, and reigned 8 months. He was killed by Juthobalus, priest of
Astarte, who lived 40 years, and reigned 12. He was succeeded by his son
Bazorus, who lived 45 years, and reigned 7. And to him his son Metten
succeeded, who lived 32 years, and reigned 29. Pygmalion, son of
Pygmalius succeeded him, who lived 56 years, and reigned 7. <span
id="fr_683"></span>[684](#fn_683.md) And in the 7th year of his reign, his
sister, fleeing to Libya, built the city which to this day is called
Carthage.” The whole period, therefore, from the reign of Hiram to the
founding of Carthage, amounts to 155 years and 8 months. And in the 12th
year of the reign of Hiram the temple in Jerusalem was built. So that
the entire time from the building of the temple to the founding of
Carthage was 143 years and 8 months.
