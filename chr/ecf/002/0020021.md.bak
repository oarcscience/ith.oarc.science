<span id="ii.iii.xii"></span>

#### <span id="ii.iii.xii-p0.1"></span>Commandment Twelfth.

##### <span id="ii.iii.xii-p0.2"></span>On the Twofold Desire. The Commandments of God Can Be Kept, and Believers Ought Not to Fear the Devil.

##### <span id="ii.iii.xii-p0.3"></span>Chap. I.

<span id="ii.iii.xii-p1"></span>He says to me, “Put away from you all
wicked desire, and clothe yourself with good and chaste desire; for
clothed with this desire you will hate wicked desire, <span
id="fr_224"></span>[225](#fn_224.md) and will rein yourself in even as you
wish. For wicked desire is wild, and is with difficulty tamed. For it is
terrible, and consumes men exceedingly by its wildness. Especially is
the servant of God terribly consumed by it, if he falls into it and is
devoid of understanding. Moreover, it consumes all such as have not on
them the garment of good desire, but are entangled and mixed up with
this world. These it delivers up to death.” “What then, sir,” say I,
“are the deeds of wicked desire which deliver men over to death? Make
them known to me, and I will refrain from them.” “Listen, then, to the
works in which evil desire slays the servants of God.” <span
id="fr_225"></span>[226](#fn_225.md)

##### <span id="ii.iii.xii-p3.1"></span>Chap. II.

<span id="ii.iii.xii-p4"></span>“Foremost of all is the desire after
another’s wife or husband, and after extravagance, and many useless
dainties and drinks, and many other foolish luxuries; for all luxury is
foolish and empty in the servants of God. These, then, are the evil
desires which slay the servants of God. For this evil desire is the
daughter of the devil. You must refrain from evil desires, that by
refraining ye may live to God. <span id="fr_226"></span>[227](#fn_226.md)
But as many as are mastered by them, and do not resist them, will perish
at last, for these desires are fatal. Put you on, then, the desire of
righteousness; and arming yourself with the fear of the Lord, <span
id="page_29">p. 29</span> <span id="ii.iii.xii-Page_29"></span>resist
them. For the fear of the Lord dwells in good desire. But if evil desire
see you armed with the fear of God, <span
id="fr_227"></span>[228](#fn_227.md) and resisting it, it will flee far
from you, and it will no longer appear to you, for it fears your armour.
Go, then, garlanded with the crown which you have gained for victory
over it, to the desire of righteousness, and, delivering up to it the
prize which you have received, serve it even as it wishes. <span
id="fr_228"></span>[229](#fn_228.md) If you serve good desire, and be
subject to it, you will gain the mastery over evil desire, and make it
subject to you even as you wish.” <span
id="fr_229"></span>[230](#fn_229.md)

##### <span id="ii.iii.xii-p8.2"></span>Chap. III.

<span id="ii.iii.xii-p9"></span>“I should like to know,” say I, “in what
way I ought to serve good desire.” “Hear,” says he: “You will practice
righteousness and virtue, truth and the fear of the Lord, faith and
meekness, and whatsoever excellences are like to these. Practising
these, you will be a well-pleasing servant of God, <span
id="fr_230"></span>[231](#fn_230.md) and you will live to Him; and every
one who shall serve good desire, shall live to God.”

<span id="ii.iii.xii-p11"></span>He concluded the twelve commandments,
and said to me, “You have now these commandments. Walk in them, and
exhort your hearers that their repentance may be pure during the
remainder of their life. Fulfil carefully this ministry which I now
entrust to you, and you will accomplish much. <span
id="fr_231"></span>[232](#fn_231.md) For you will find favour among those
who are to repent, and they will give heed to your words; for I will be
with you, and will compel them to obey you.” I say to him, “Sir, these
commandments are great, and good, and glorious, and fitted to gladden
the heart of the man who can perform them. But I do not know if these
commandments can be kept by man, because they are exceeding hard.” He
answered and said to me, “If you lay it down as certain that they can be
kept, <span id="fr_232"></span>[233](#fn_232.md) then you will easily keep
them, and they will not be hard. But if you come to imagine that they
cannot be kept by man, then you will not keep them. Now I say to you, If
you do not keep them, but neglect them, you will not be saved, nor your
children, nor your house, since you have already determined for yourself
that these commandments cannot be kept by man.”

##### <span id="ii.iii.xii-p13.1"></span>Chap. IV.

<span id="ii.iii.xii-p14"></span>These things he said to me in tones of
the deepest anger, so that I was confounded and exceedingly afraid of
him, for his figure was altered so that a man could not endure his
anger. But seeing me altogether agitated and confused, he began to speak
to me in more gentle tones; and he said: “O fool, senseless and
doubting, do you not perceive how great is the glory of God, and how
strong and marvellous, in that He created the world for the sake of
man, <span id="fr_233"></span>[234](#fn_233.md) and subjected all creation
to him, and gave him power to rule over everything under heaven? If,
then, man is lord of the creatures of God, and rules over all, is he not
able to be lord also of these commandments? For,” says he, “the man who
has the Lord in his heart can also be lord of all, and of every one of
these commandments. But to those who have the Lord only on their
lips, <span id="fr_234"></span>[235](#fn_234.md) but their hearts
hardened, <span id="fr_235"></span>[236](#fn_235.md) and who are far from
the Lord, the commandments are hard and difficult. Put, therefore, ye
who are empty and fickle in your faith, the Lord in your heart, and ye
will know that there is nothing easier or sweeter, or more manageable,
than these commandments. Return, ye who walk in the commandments of the
devil, in hard, and bitter, and wild licentiousness, and fear not the
devil; for there is no power in him against you, for I will be with you,
the angel of repentance, who am lord over him. The devil has fear only,
but his fear has no strength. <span id="fr_236"></span>[237](#fn_236.md)
Fear him not, then, and he will flee from you.”

##### <span id="ii.iii.xii-p18.2"></span>Chap. V.

<span id="ii.iii.xii-p19"></span>I say to him, “Sir, listen to me for a
moment.” “Say what you wish,” says he. “Man, sir,” say I, “is eager to
keep the commandments of God, and there is no one who does not ask of
the Lord that strength may be given him for these commandments, and that
he may be subject to them; but the devil is hard, and holds sway over
them.” “He cannot,” says he, “hold sway over the servants of God, who
with all their heart place their hopes in Him. The devil can wrestle
against these, overthrow them he cannot. If, then, ye resist him, he
will be conquered, and flee in disgrace from you. As many, therefore,”
says he, “as are empty, fear the devil, as possessing power. When a man
has filled very suitable jars with good wine, and a few among those jars
are left empty, <span id="fr_237"></span>[238](#fn_237.md) then he comes to
the jars, and does not look at the full jars, for he knows that they are
full; but he looks at the empty, being afraid lest they have become
sour. For empty jars quickly become sour, and the goodness of the wine
is gone. So also the devil goes to all <span id="page_30">p. 30</span>
<span id="ii.iii.xii-Page_30"></span>the servants of God to try them. As
many, then, as are full in the faith, resist him strongly, and he
withdraws from them, having no way by which he might enter them. He
goes, then, to the empty, and finding a way of entrance, into them, he
produces in them whatever he wishes, and they become his
servants.” <span id="fr_238"></span>[239](#fn_238.md)

##### <span id="ii.iii.xii-p21.2"></span>Chap. VI.

<span id="ii.iii.xii-p22"></span>“But I, the angel of repentance, say to
you Fear not the devil; for I was sent,” says he, “to be with you who
repent with all your heart, and to make you strong in faith. Trust
God, <span id="fr_239"></span>[240](#fn_239.md) then, ye who on account of
your sins have despaired of life, and who add to your sins and weigh
down your life; for if ye return to the Lord with all your heart, and
practice righteousness the rest of your days, <span
id="fr_240"></span>[241](#fn_240.md) and serve Him according to His will,
He will heal your former sins, and you will have power to hold sway over
the works of the devil. But as to the threats of the devil, fear them
not at all, for he is powerless as the sinews of a dead man. Give ear to
me, then, and fear Him who has all power, both to save and
destroy, <span id="fr_241"></span>[242](#fn_241.md) and keep His
commandments, and ye will live to God.” I say to him, “Sir, I am now
made strong in all the ordinances of the Lord, because you are with me;
and I know that you will crush all the power of the devil, and we shall
have rule over him, and shall prevail against all his works. And I hope,
sir, to be able to keep all these commandments <span
id="fr_242"></span>[243](#fn_242.md) which you have enjoined upon me, the
Lord strengthening me.” “You will keep them,” says he, “if your heart be
pure towards the Lord; and all will keep them who cleanse their hearts
from the vain desires of this world, and they will live to God.”
