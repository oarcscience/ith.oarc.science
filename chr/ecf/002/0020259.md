<span id="vi.iii.i.ix"></span>

##### <span id="vi.iii.i.ix-p0.1"></span>Chapter IX.—That It is the Prerogative of the Same Power to Be Beneficent and to Punish Justly. Also the Manner of the Instruction of the Logos.

<span id="vi.iii.i.ix-p1"></span>With all His power, therefore, the
Instructor of humanity, the Divine Word, using all the resources of
wisdom, devotes Himself to the saving of the children, admonishing,
upbraiding, blaming, chiding, reproving, threatening, healing,
promising, favouring; and as it were, by many reins, curbing the
irrational impulses of humanity. To speak briefly, therefore, the Lord
acts towards us as we do towards our children. “Hast thou children?
correct them,” is the exhortation of the book of Wisdom, “and bend them
from their youth. Hast thou daughters? attend to their body, and let not
thy face brighten towards them,” <span
id="fr_1209"></span>[1210](#fn_1209.md) —although we love our children
exceedingly, both sons and daughters, above aught else whatever. For
those who speak with a man merely to please him, have little love for
him, seeing they do not pain him; while those that speak for his good,
though they inflict pain for the time, do him good for ever after. It is
not immediate pleasure, but future enjoyment, that the Lord has in view.

<span id="vi.iii.i.ix-p3"></span>Let us now proceed to consider the mode
of His loving discipline, with the aid of the prophetic testimony.

<span id="vi.iii.i.ix-p4"></span>Admonition, then, is the censure of
loving care, and produces understanding. Such is the Instructor in His
admonitions, as when He says in the Gospel, “How often would I have
gathered thy children, as a bird gathers her young ones under her wings,
and ye would not!” <span id="fr_1210"></span>[1211](#fn_1210.md) And again,
the Scripture admonishes, saying, “And they committed adultery with
stock and stone, and burnt incense to Baal.” <span
id="fr_1211"></span>[1212](#fn_1211.md) For it is a very great proof of His
love, that, though knowing well the shamelessness of the people that had
kicked and bounded away, He notwithstanding exhorts them to repentance,
and says by Ezekiel, “Son of man, thou dwellest in the midst of
scorpions; nevertheless, speak to them, if peradventure they will
hear.” <span id="fr_1212"></span>[1213](#fn_1212.md) Further, to Moses He
says, “Go and tell Pharaoh to send My people forth; but I know that he
will not send them forth.” <span id="fr_1213"></span>[1214](#fn_1213.md)
For He shows both things: both His divinity in His foreknowledge of what
would take place, and His love in affording an opportunity for
repentance to the self-determination of the soul. He admonishes also by
Esaias, in His care for the people, when He says, “This people honour Me
with their lips, but their heart is far from Me.” What follows is
reproving censure: “In vain do they worship <span id="page_229">p.
229</span> <span id="vi.iii.i.ix-Page_229"></span>Me, teaching for
doctrines the commandments of men.” <span
id="fr_1214"></span>[1215](#fn_1214.md) Here His loving care, having shown
their sin, shows salvation side by side.

<span id="vi.iii.i.ix-p10"></span>Upbraiding is censure on account of
what is base, conciliating to what is noble. This is shown by Jeremiah:
“They were female-mad horses; each one neighed after his neighbour’s
wife. Shall I not visit for these things? saith the <span
class="sc"><span id="vi.iii.i.ix-p10.1"></span>Lord</span>: shall not my
soul be avenged on such a nation as this?” <span
id="fr_1215"></span>[1216](#fn_1215.md) He everywhere interweaves fear,
because “the fear of the <span class="sc"><span
id="vi.iii.i.ix-p11.2"></span>Lord</span> is the beginning of
sense.” <span id="fr_1216"></span>[1217](#fn_1216.md) And again, by Hosea,
He says, “Shall I not visit them? for they themselves were mingled with
harlots, and sacrificed with the initiated; and the people that
understood embraced a harlot.” <span
id="fr_1217"></span>[1218](#fn_1217.md) He shows their offence to be
clearer, by declaring that they understood, and thus sinned wilfully.
Understanding is the eye of the soul; wherefore also Israel means, “he
that sees God”—that is, he that understands God.

<span id="vi.iii.i.ix-p14"></span>Complaint is censure of those who are
regarded as despising or neglecting. He employs this form when He says
by Esaias: “Hear, O heaven; and give ear, O earth: for the <span
class="sc"><span id="vi.iii.i.ix-p14.1"></span>Lord</span> hath spoken,
I have begotten and brought up children, but they have disregarded Me.
The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master’s crib: but Israel hath
not known Me.” <span id="fr_1218"></span>[1219](#fn_1218.md) For how shall
we not regard it fearful, if he that knows God, shall not recognise the
Lord; but while the ox and the ass, stupid and foolish animals, will
know him who feeds them, Israel is found to be more irrational than
these? And having, by Jeremiah, complained against the people on many
grounds, He adds: “And they have forsaken Me, saith the <span
class="sc"><span id="vi.iii.i.ix-p15.2"></span>Lord</span>.” <span
id="fr_1219"></span>[1220](#fn_1219.md)

<span id="vi.iii.i.ix-p17"></span>Invective <span
id="fr_1220"></span>[1221](#fn_1220.md) is a reproachful upbraiding, or
chiding censure. This mode of treatment the Instructor employs in
Isaiah, when He says, “Woe to you, children revolters. Thus saith the
<span class="sc"><span id="vi.iii.i.ix-p18.1"></span>Lord</span>, Ye
have taken counsel, but not by Me; and made compacts, but not by My
Spirit.” <span id="fr_1221"></span>[1222](#fn_1221.md) He uses the very
bitter mordant of fear in each case repressing <span
id="fr_1222"></span>[1223](#fn_1222.md) the people, and at the same time
turning them to salvation; as also wool that is undergoing the process
of dyeing is wont to be previously treated with mordants, in order to
prepare it for taking on a fast colour.

<span id="vi.iii.i.ix-p21"></span>Reproof is the bringing forward of
sin, laying it before one. This form of instruction He employs as in the
highest degree necessary, by reason of the feebleness of the faith of
many. For He says by Esaias, “Ye have forsaken the <span
class="sc"><span id="vi.iii.i.ix-p21.1"></span>Lord</span>, and have
provoked the Holy One of Israel to anger.” <span
id="fr_1223"></span>[1224](#fn_1223.md) And He says also by Jeremiah:
“Heaven was astonished at this, and the earth shuddered exceedingly. For
My people have committed two evils; they have forsaken Me, the fountain
of living waters, and have hewn out to themselves broken cisterns, which
will not be able to hold water.” <span
id="fr_1224"></span>[1225](#fn_1224.md) And again, by the same: “Jerusalem
hath sinned a sin; therefore it became commotion. All that glorified her
dishonoured her, when they saw her baseness.” <span
id="fr_1225"></span>[1226](#fn_1225.md) And He uses the bitter and
biting <span id="fr_1226"></span>[1227](#fn_1226.md) language of reproof in
His consolations by Solomon, tacitly alluding to the love for children
that characterizes His instruction: “My son, despise not thou the
chastening of the <span class="sc"><span
id="vi.iii.i.ix-p25.3"></span>Lord</span>; nor faint when thou art
rebuked of Him: for whom the <span class="sc"><span
id="vi.iii.i.ix-p25.4"></span>Lord</span> loveth He chasteneth, and
scourgeth every son whom He receiveth;” <span
id="fr_1227"></span>[1228](#fn_1227.md) “For a man who is a sinner escapes
reproof.” <span id="fr_1228"></span>[1229](#fn_1228.md) Consequently,
therefore, the Scripture says, “Let the righteous reprove and correct
me; but let not the oil of the sinner anoint my head.” <span
id="fr_1229"></span>[1230](#fn_1229.md)

<span id="vi.iii.i.ix-p29"></span>Bringing one to his senses (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.iii.i.ix-p29.1"></span>φρένωσις</span>) is
censure, which makes a man think. Neither from this form of instruction
does he abstain, but says by Jeremiah, “How long shall I cry, and you
not hear? So your ears are uncircumcised.” <span
id="fr_1230"></span>[1231](#fn_1230.md) O blessed forbearance! And again,
by the same: “All the heathen are uncircumcised, but this people is
uncircumcised in heart:” <span id="fr_1231"></span>[1232](#fn_1231.md) “for
the people are disobedient; children,” says He, “in whom is not
faith.” <span id="fr_1232"></span>[1233](#fn_1232.md)

<span id="vi.iii.i.ix-p33"></span>Visitation is severe rebuke. He uses
this species in the Gospel: “O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that killest the
prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto thee!” The reduplication
of the name gives strength to the rebuke. For he that knows God, how
does he persecute God’s servants? Wherefore He says, “Your house is left
desolate; for I say unto you, Henceforth ye shall not see Me, till ye
shall say, Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord.” <span
id="fr_1233"></span>[1234](#fn_1233.md) For if you do not receive His love,
ye shall know His power.

<span id="vi.iii.i.ix-p35"></span>Denunciation is vehement speech. And
He employs denunciation as medicine, by Isaiah, saying, “Ah, sinful
nation, lawless sons, people full of sins, wicked seed!” <span
id="fr_1234"></span>[1235](#fn_1234.md) And in the Gospel by John He says,
“Serpents, brood of vipers.” <span id="fr_1235"></span>[1236](#fn_1235.md)

<span id="page_230">p. 230</span> <span
id="vi.iii.i.ix-Page_230"></span>

<span id="vi.iii.i.ix-p38"></span>Accusation is censure of wrong-doers.
This mode of instruction He employs by David, when He says: “The people
whom I knew not served me, and at the hearing of the ear obeyed me. Sons
of strangers lied to me, and halted from their ways.” <span
id="fr_1236"></span>[1237](#fn_1236.md) And by Jeremiah: “And I gave her a
writing of divorcement, and covenant-breaking Judah feared not.” <span
id="fr_1237"></span>[1238](#fn_1237.md) And again: “And the house of Israel
disregarded Me; and the house of Judah lied to the <span
class="sc"><span id="vi.iii.i.ix-p40.2"></span>Lord</span>.” <span
id="fr_1238"></span>[1239](#fn_1238.md)

<span id="vi.iii.i.ix-p42"></span>Bewailing one’s fate is latent
censure, and by artful aid ministers salvation as under a veil. He made
use of this by Jeremiah: “How did the city sit solitary that was full of
people! She that ruled over territories became as a widow; she came
under tribute; weeping, she wept in the night.” <span
id="fr_1239"></span>[1240](#fn_1239.md)

<span id="vi.iii.i.ix-p44"></span>Objurgation is objurgatory censure. Of
this help the Divine Instructor made use by Jeremiah, saying, “Thou
hadst a whore’s forehead; thou wast shameless towards all; and didst not
call me to the house, who am thy father, and lord of thy
virginity.” <span id="fr_1240"></span>[1241](#fn_1240.md) “And a fair and
graceful harlot skilled in enchanted potions.” <span
id="fr_1241"></span>[1242](#fn_1241.md) With consummate art, after applying
to the virgin the opprobrious name of whoredom, He thereupon calls her
back to an honourable life by filling her with shame.

<span id="vi.iii.i.ix-p47"></span>Indignation is a rightful upbraiding;
or upbraiding on account of ways exalted above what is right. In this
way He instructed by Moses, when He said, “Faulty children, a generation
crooked and perverse, do ye thus requite the <span class="sc"><span
id="vi.iii.i.ix-p47.1"></span>Lord</span>? This people is foolish, and
not wise. Is not this thy father who acquired thee?” <span
id="fr_1242"></span>[1243](#fn_1242.md) He says also by Isaiah, “Thy
princes are disobedient, companions of thieves, loving gifts, following
after rewards, not judging the orphans.” <span
id="fr_1243"></span>[1244](#fn_1243.md)

<span id="vi.iii.i.ix-p50"></span>In fine, the system He pursues to
inspire fear is the source of salvation. And it is the prerogative of
goodness to save: “The mercy of the Lord is on all flesh, while He
reproves, corrects, and teaches as a shepherd His flock. He pities those
who receive His instruction, and those who eagerly seek union with
Him.” <span id="fr_1244"></span>[1245](#fn_1244.md) And with such guidance
He guarded the six hundred thousand footmen that were brought together
in the hardness of heart in which they were found; scourging, pitying,
striking, healing, in compassion and discipline: “For according to the
greatness of His mercy, so is His rebuke.” <span
id="fr_1245"></span>[1246](#fn_1245.md) For it is indeed noble not to sin;
but it is good also for the sinner to repent; just as it is best to be
always in good health, but well to recover from disease. So He commands
by Solomon: “Strike thou thy son with the rod, that thou mayest deliver
his soul from death.” <span id="fr_1246"></span>[1247](#fn_1246.md) And
again: “Abstain not from chastising thy son, but correct him with the
rod; for he will not die.” <span id="fr_1247"></span>[1248](#fn_1247.md)

<span id="vi.iii.i.ix-p55"></span>For reproof and rebuke, as also the
original term implies, are the stripes of the soul, chastizing sins,
preventing death, and leading to self-control those carried away to
licentiousness. Thus also Plato, knowing reproof to be the greatest
power for reformation, and the most sovereign purification, in
accordance with what has been said, observes, “that he who is in the
highest degree impure is uninstructed and base, by reason of his being
unreproved in those respects in which he who is destined to be truly
happy ought to be purest and best.”

<span id="vi.iii.i.ix-p56"></span>For if rulers are not a terror to a
good work, how shall God, who is by nature good, be a terror to him who
sins not? “If thou doest evil, be afraid,” <span
id="fr_1248"></span>[1249](#fn_1248.md) says the apostle. Wherefore the
apostle himself also in every case uses stringent language to the
Churches, after the Lord’s example; and conscious of his own boldness,
and of the weakness of his hearers, he says to the Galatians: “Am I your
enemy, because I tell you the truth?” <span
id="fr_1249"></span>[1250](#fn_1249.md) Thus also people in health do not
require a physician, do not require him as long as they are strong; but
those who are ill need his skill. Thus also we who in our lives are ill
of shameful lusts and reprehensible excesses, and other inflammatory
effects of the passions, need the Saviour. And He administers not only
mild, but also stringent medicines. The bitter roots of fear then arrest
the eating sores of our sins. Wherefore also fear is salutary, if
bitter. Sick, we truly stand in need of the Saviour; having wandered, of
one to guide us; blind, of one to lead us to the light; thirsty, “of the
fountain of life, of which whosoever partakes, shall no longer
thirst;” <span id="fr_1250"></span>[1251](#fn_1250.md) dead, we need life;
sheep, we need a shepherd; we who are children need a tutor, while
universal humanity stands in need of Jesus; so that we may not continue
intractable and sinners to the end, and thus fall into condemnation, but
may be separated from the chaff, and stored up in the paternal garner.
“For the fan is in the Lord’s hand, by which the chaff due to the fire
is separated from the wheat.” <span id="fr_1251"></span>[1252](#fn_1251.md)
You may learn, if you will, the crowning wisdom of the all-holy Shepherd
and Instructor, of the omnipotent and paternal Word, when He
figuratively represents Himself as the Shepherd of the sheep. And He is
the Tutor of the <span id="page_231">p. 231</span> <span
id="vi.iii.i.ix-Page_231"></span>children. He says therefore by Ezekiel,
directing His discourse to the elders, and setting before them a
salutary description of His wise solicitude: “And that which is lame I
will bind up, and that which is sick I will heal, and that which has
wandered I will turn back; and I will feed them on my holy
mountain.” <span id="fr_1252"></span>[1253](#fn_1252.md) Such are the
promises of the good Shepherd.

<span id="vi.iii.i.ix-p62"></span>Feed us, the children, as sheep. Yea,
Master, fill us with righteousness, Thine own pasture; yea, O
Instructor, feed us on Thy holy mountain the Church, which towers aloft,
which is above the clouds, which touches heaven. “And I will be,” He
says, “their Shepherd,” <span id="fr_1253"></span>[1254](#fn_1253.md) and
will be near them, as the garment to their skin. He wishes to save my
flesh by enveloping it in the robe of immortality, and He hath anointed
my body. “They shall call Me,” He says, “and I will say, Here am
I.” <span id="fr_1254"></span>[1255](#fn_1254.md) Thou didst hear sooner
than I expected, Master. “And if they pass over, they shall not
slip,” <span id="fr_1255"></span>[1256](#fn_1255.md) saith the Lord. For we
who are passing over to immortality shall not fall into corruption, for
He shall sustain us. For so He has said, and so He has willed. Such is
our Instructor, righteously good. “I came not,” He says, “to be
ministered unto, but to minister.” <span
id="fr_1256"></span>[1257](#fn_1256.md) Wherefore He is introduced in the
Gospel “wearied,” <span id="fr_1257"></span>[1258](#fn_1257.md) because
toiling for us, and promising “to give His life a ransom for
many.” <span id="fr_1258"></span>[1259](#fn_1258.md) For him alone who does
so He owns to be the good shepherd. Generous, therefore, is He who gives
for us the greatest of all gifts, His own life; and beneficent
exceedingly, and loving to men, in that, when He might have been Lord,
He wished to be a brother man; and so good was He that He died for us.

<span id="vi.iii.i.ix-p69"></span>Further, His righteousness cried, “If
ye come straight to me, I also will come straight to you but if ye walk
crooked, I also will walk crooked, saith the Lord of hosts;” <span
id="fr_1259"></span>[1260](#fn_1259.md) meaning by the crooked ways the
chastisements of sinners. For the straight and natural way which is
indicated by the *Iota* of the name of Jesus is His goodness, which is
firm and sure towards those who have believed at hearing: “When I
called, ye obeyed not, saith the Lord; but set at nought my counsels,
and heeded not my reproofs.” <span id="fr_1260"></span>[1261](#fn_1260.md)
Thus the Lord’s reproof is most beneficial. David also says of them, “A
perverse and provoking race; a race which set not their heart aright,
and whose spirit was not faithful with God: they kept not the covenant
of God, and would not walk in His law.” <span
id="fr_1261"></span>[1262](#fn_1261.md)

<span id="vi.iii.i.ix-p73"></span>Such are the causes of provocation for
which the Judge comes to inflict punishment on those that would not
choose a life of goodness. Wherefore also afterwards He assailed them
more roughly; in order, if possible, to drag them back from their
impetuous rush towards death. He therefore tells by David the most
manifest cause of the threatening: “They believed not in His wonderful
works. When He slew them, they sought after Him, and turned and inquired
early after God; and remembered that God was their Helper, and God the
Most High their Redeemer.” <span id="fr_1262"></span>[1263](#fn_1262.md)
Thus He knew that they turned for fear, while they despised His love:
for, for the most part, that goodness which is always mild is despised;
but He who admonishes by the loving fear of righteousness is reverenced.

<span id="vi.iii.i.ix-p75"></span>There is a twofold species of fear,
the one of which is accompanied with reverence, such as citizens show
towards good rulers, and we towards God, as also right-minded children
towards their fathers. “For an unbroken horse turns out unmanageable,
and a son who is let take his own way turns out reckless.” <span
id="fr_1263"></span>[1264](#fn_1263.md) The other species of fear is
accompanied with hatred, which slaves feel towards hard masters, and the
Hebrews felt, who made God a master, not a father. And as far as piety
is concerned, that which is voluntary and spontaneous differs much, nay
entirely, from what is forced. “For He,” it is said, “is merciful; He
will heal their sins, and not destroy them, and fully turn away His
anger, and not kindle all His wrath.” <span
id="fr_1264"></span>[1265](#fn_1264.md) See how the justice of the
Instructor, which deals in rebukes, is shown; and the goodness of God,
which deals in compassions. Wherefore David—that is, the Spirit by
him—embracing them both, sings of God Himself, “Justice and judgment are
the preparation of His throne: mercy and truth shall go before Thy
face.” <span id="fr_1265"></span>[1266](#fn_1265.md) He declares that it
belongs to the same power both to judge and to do good. For there is
power over both together, and judgment separates that which is just from
its opposite. And He who is truly God is just and good; who is Himself
all, and all is He; for He is God, the only God.

<span id="vi.iii.i.ix-p79"></span>For as the mirror is not evil to an
ugly man because it shows him what like he is; and as the physician is
not evil to the sick man because he tells him of his fever,—for the
physician is not the cause of the fever, but only points out the
fever;—so neither is He, that reproves, ill-disposed towards him who is
diseased in soul. For He does not put the transgressions on him, but
only shows the sins which are there; in order to turn him away from
similar practices. So <span id="page_232">p. 232</span> <span
id="vi.iii.i.ix-Page_232"></span>God is good on His own account, and
just also on ours, and He is just because He is good. And His justice is
shown to us by His own Word from there from above, whence the Father
was. For before He became Creator He was God; He was good. And therefore
He wished to be Creator and Father. And the nature of all that love was
the source of righteousness—the cause, too, of His lighting up His sun,
and sending down His own Son. And He first announced the good
righteousness that is from heaven, when He said, “No man knoweth the
Son, but the Father; nor the Father, but the Son.” <span
id="fr_1266"></span>[1267](#fn_1266.md) This mutual and reciprocal
knowledge is the symbol of primeval justice. Then justice came down to
men both in the letter and in the body, in the Word and in the law,
constraining humanity to saving repentance; for it was good. But do you
not obey God? Then blame yourself, who drag to yourself the judge.
