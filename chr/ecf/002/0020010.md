##### <span id="ii.iii.i-p0.2"></span>On Faith in God.

<span id="ii.iii.i-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iii.i-p1.1"></span>First</span> of all, believe <span
id="fr_151"></span>[152](#fn_151) that there is one God who created and
finished all things, and made all things out of nothing. He alone is
able to contain the whole, but Himself cannot be contained. <span
id="fr_152"></span>[153](#fn_152) Have faith therefore in Him, and fear
Him; and fearing Him, exercise self-control. Keep these commands, and
you will cast away from you all wickedness, and put on the strength of
righteousness, and live to God, if you keep this commandment.

<span id="ii.iii.i-p2"></span> \[These first words are quoted by
Irenæus, vol. i. p. 488, this series. Note that this book begins with
the fundamental principle of faith, which is everywhere identified by
Hermas (as in Vision ii. cap. 2) with faith in the Son of God. The Holy
Spirit is also everywhere exhibited in this work. But the careful
student will discover a very deep plan in the treatment of this subject.
Repentance and faith are the great themes, and the long-suffering of
God, against the Montanists. But he begins by indicating the divine
character and the law of God. He treats of sin in its relations to the
law and the gospel: little by little, opening the way, he reaches a
point, in the Eighth Similitude, where he introduces the New Law,
identifying it, indeed, with the old, but magnifying the gospel of the
Son of God. Hermas takes for Granted the “Son of man;” but everywhere he
avoids the names of His humanity, and brings out “the Son of God” with
emphasis, in the spirit of St. John’s Gospel (cap. i.) and of the
Epistle to the Hebrews (cap. i.), as if he feared the familiarities even
of believers in speaking of Jesus or of Christ, without recognising His
eternal power and Godhead.\]

<span id="ii.iii.i-p3"></span> *Contained.*—Vat. and Pal. add: and who
cannot be defined in words, nor conceived by the mind. \[Here we have
the “Incomprehensible,” so familiar in the liturgic formula improperly
called the *Athanasian Creed*. In the Latin *immensus*, in the Greek
<span class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.i-p3.1"></span>ἄπειρος</span>;
i.e., “non mensurabilis, quiâ *inlocalis*, incircumscriptus, ubique
totus, ubique prœsens, ubique potens.” *Not intelligible* is too
frequently supposed to be the sense, but this is feeble and ambiguous.
See Waterland, Works, iv. p. 320 London, 1823.\]
