##### <span id="v.ii.xxx-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXX.—Reasons Why Divinity Has Been Ascribed to Men.

<span id="v.ii.xxx-p1"></span>For if detestable and god-hated men had
the reputation of being gods, and the daughter of Derceto, Semiramis, a
lascivious and blood-stained woman, was esteemed a Syria goddess; and
if, on account of Derceto, the Syrians worship doves and Semiramis (for,
a thing impossible, a woman was changed into a dove: the story is in
Ctesias), what wonder if some should be called gods by their people on
the ground of their rule and sovereignty (the Sibyl, of whom Plato also
makes mention, says:—

> <span id="v.ii.xxx-p1.1"></span> “It was the generation then the
> tenth,  
> Of men endow’d with speech, since forth the flood  
> Had burst upon the men of former times,  
> And Kronos, Japetus, and Titan reigned,  
> Whom men, of Ouranos and Gaïa  
> Proclaimed the noblest sons, and named them so, <span
> id="fr_814"></span>[815](#fn_814)  
> Because of men endowed with gift of speech  
> They were the first”); <span id="fr_815"></span>[816](#fn_815)  

<span id="v.ii.xxx-p4"></span>and others for their strength, as Heracles
and Perseus; and others for their art, as Asclepius? Those, therefore,
to whom either the subjects gave honour or the rulers themselves
\[assumed it\], obtained the name, some from fear, others from revenge.
Thus Antinous, through the benevolence of your ancestors towards their
subjects, came to be regarded as a god. But those who came after adopted
the worship without examination.

> <span id="v.ii.xxx-p4.1"></span> “The Cretans always lie; for they, O
> king,  
> Have built a tomb to thee who art not dead.” <span
> id="fr_816"></span>[817](#fn_816)  

<span id="v.ii.xxx-p6"></span>Though you believe, O Callimachus, in the
nativity of Zeus, you do not believe in his sepulchre; and whilst you
think to obscure the truth, you in fact proclaim him dead, even to those
who are ignorant; and if you see the cave, you call to mind the
childbirth of Rhea; but when you see the coffin, you throw a shadow over
his death, not considering that the unbegotten God alone is eternal. For
either the tales told by the multitude and the poets about the gods are
unworthy of credit, and the reverence shown them is superfluous (for
those do not exist, the tales concerning whom are untrue); or if the
births, the amours, the murders, the thefts, the castrations, the
thunderbolts, are true, they no longer exist, having ceased to be since
they were born, having previously had no being. And on what principle
must we believe some things and disbelieve others, when the poets have
written their stories in order to gain greater veneration for them? For
surely those through whom they have got to be considered gods, and who
have striven to represent their deeds as worthy of reverence, cannot
have invented their sufferings. That, therefore, we are not atheists,
acknowledging as we do God the Maker of this universe and His Logos, has
been proved according to my ability, if not according to the importance
of the subject.
