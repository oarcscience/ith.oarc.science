##### <span id="iii.ii.xxviii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXVIII.—Condemnation of the Greek Legislation.

<span id="iii.ii.xxviii-p1"></span>On this account I reject your
legislation also; for there ought to be one common polity for all; but
now there are as many different codes as there are states, so that
things held disgraceful in some are honourable in others. The Greeks
consider intercourse with a mother as unlawful, but this practice is
esteemed most becoming by the Persian Magi; pæderasty is condemned by
the Barbarians, but by the Romans, who endeavour to collect herds of
boys like grazing horses, it is honoured with certain privileges.
