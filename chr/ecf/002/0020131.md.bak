##### <span id="iv.ii.ii.xxxiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXIII.—Profane History Gives No Account of These Matters.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xxxiii-p1"></span>Who, then, of those called sages,
and poets, and historians, could tell us truly of these things,
themselves being much later born, and introducing a multitude of gods,
who were born so many years after the cities, and are more modern than
kings, and nations, and wars? For they should have made mention of all
events, even those which happened before the flood; both of the creation
of the world and the formation of man, and the whole succession of
events. The Egyptian or Chaldæan prophets, and the other writers, should
have been able accurately to tell, if at least they spoke by a divine
and pure spirit, and spoke truth in all that was uttered by them; and
they should have announced not only things past or present, but also
those that were to come upon the world. And therefore it is proved that
all others have been in error; and that we Christians alone have
possessed the truth, inasmuch as we are taught by the Holy Spirit, who
spoke in the holy prophets, and foretold all things.
