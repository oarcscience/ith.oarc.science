<p> <a name="vi.iv.v.ii"></A> <h5 align="center"><a name="vi.iv.v.ii-p0.1"></A>Chap. II.&#8212;On Hope.</h5>  
<p><a name="vi.iv.v.ii-p1"></A>Respecting faith we have adduced sufficient testimonies of writings among the Greeks. But in order not to exceed bounds, through eagerness to collect a very great many also respecting hope and love, suffice it merely to say that in the <i>Crito</i> Socrates, who prefers a good life and death to life itself, thinks that we have hope of another life after death.</p>  
<p><a name="vi.iv.v.ii-p2"></A>Also in the <i>Ph&#339;drus</i> he says, &#8220;That only when in a separate state can the soul become partaker of the wisdom which is true, and surpasses human power; and when, having reached the end of hope by philosophic love, desire shall waft it to heaven, then,&#8221; says he, &#8220;does it receive the commencement of another, an immortal life.&#8221; And in the <i>Symposium </i>he says, &#8220;That there is instilled into all the natural love of generating what is like, and in men of generating men alone, and in the good man of the generation of the counterpart of himself. But it is impossible for the good man to do this without possessing the perfect virtues, in which he will train the youth who have recourse to him.&#8221; And as he says in the <i>The&#339;tetus,</i>&#8220;He will beget and finish men. For some procreate by the body, others by the soul;&#8221; since also with the barbarian philosophers to teach and enlighten is called to regenerate; and &#8220;I have begotten you in Jesus Christ,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2974"></A><A HREF="#fn_2974"><FONT SIZE="1">2975</FONT></A>
 says the good apostle somewhere.</p>  
<p><a name="vi.iv.v.ii-p4"></A>Empedocles, too, enumerates friendship among the elements, conceiving it as a combining love:&#8212;</p>  <blockquote><a name="vi.iv.v.ii-p4.1"></A> &#8220;Which do you look at with  your mind; and don&#146;t sit gaping with your eyes.&#8221;<br>  </blockquote>  
<p class="skip"><a name="vi.iv.v.ii-p5"></A>Parmenides, too, in his poem, alluding to hope, speaks thus:&#8212;</p>  <A NAME="page_448"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 448</FONT></A> <a name="vi.iv.v.ii-Page_448"></A>  <blockquote><a name="vi.iv.v.ii-p5.1"></A> &#8220;Yet look with the mind  certainly on what is absent as present,<br>  For it will not sever that which is  from the grasp it has of that which is<br>  Not, even if scattered in every  direction over the world or combined.&#8221;<br>  </blockquote>
