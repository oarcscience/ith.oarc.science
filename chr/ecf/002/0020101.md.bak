##### <span id="iv.ii.ii.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.—What Has Become of the Gods?

<span id="iv.ii.ii.iii-p1"></span>And of the gods of former times, if
indeed they were begotten, the generation was sufficiently prolific. But
now, where is their generation exhibited? For if of old they begot and
were begotten, it is plain that even to the present time there should be
gods begotten and born; or at least if it be not so, such a race will be
reckoned impotent. For either they have waxed old, and on that account
no longer beget, or they have died out and no longer exist. For if the
gods were begotten, they ought to be born even until now, as men, too,
are born; yea, much more numerous should the gods be than men, as the
Sibyl says:—

> <span id="iv.ii.ii.iii-p1.1"></span> “For if the gods beget, and each
> remains  
> Immortal, then the race of gods must be  
> More numerous than mortals, and the throng  
> So great that mortals find no room to stand.”  

<span id="iv.ii.ii.iii-p2"></span>For if the children begotten of men
who are mortal and short-lived make an appearance even until now, and
men have not ceased to be born, so that cities and villages are full,
and even the country places also are inhabited, how ought not the gods,
who, according to your poets, do not die, much rather to beget and be
begotten, since you say that the gods were produced by generation? And
why was the mount which is called Olympus formerly inhabited by the
gods, but now lies deserted? Or why did Jupiter, in days of yore, dwell
on Ida, and was known to dwell there, according to Homer and other
poets, but now is beyond ken? And why was he found only in one part of
the earth, and not everywhere? For either he neglected the other parts,
or was not able to be present everywhere and provide for all. For if he
were, e.g., in an eastern place, he was not in the western; and if, on
the other hand, he were present in the western <span id="page_95">p.
95</span> <span id="iv.ii.ii.iii-Page_95"></span>parts, he was not in
the eastern. But this is the attribute of God, the Highest and Almighty,
and the living God, not only to be everywhere present, but also to see
all things and to hear all, and by no means to be confined in a place;
for if He were, then the place containing Him would be greater than He;
for that which contains is greater than that which is contained. For God
is not contained, but is Himself the place of all. But why has Jupiter
left Ida? Was it because he died, or did that mountain no longer please
him? And where has he gone? To heaven? No. But you will perhaps say, To
Crete? Yes, for there, too, his tomb is shown to this day. Again, you
will say, To Pisa, where he reflects glory on the hands of Phidias to
this day. Let us, then, proceed to the writings of the philosophers and
poets.
