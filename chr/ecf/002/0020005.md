<span id="ii.ii.ii"></span>

#### <span id="ii.ii.ii-p0.1"></span>Vision Second.

##### <span id="ii.ii.ii-p0.2"></span>Again, of His Neglect in Chastising His Talkative Wife and His Lustful Sons, and of His Character.

##### <span id="ii.ii.ii-p0.3"></span>Chap. I.

<span id="ii.ii.ii-p1"></span>As I was going to the country <span
id="fr_54"></span>[55](#fn_54.md) about the same time as on the previous
year, in my walk I recalled to memory the vision of that year. And again
the Spirit carried me away, and took me to the same place where I had
been the year before. <span id="fr_55"></span>[56](#fn_55.md) On coming to
that place, I bowed my knees and began to pray to the Lord, and to
glorify His name, because He had deemed me worthy, and had made known to
me my former sins. On rising from prayer, I see opposite me that old
woman, whom I had seen the year before, walking and reading some book.
And she says to me, “Can you carry a report of these things to the elect
of God?” I say to her, “Lady, so much I cannot retain in my memory, but
give me the book and I shall transcribe it.” “Take it,” says she, “and
you will give it back to me.” Thereupon I took it, and going away into a
certain part of the country, I transcribed the whole of it letter by
letter; <span id="fr_56"></span>[57](#fn_56.md) but the syllables of it I
did not catch. No sooner, however, had I finished the writing of the
book, than all of a sudden it was snatched from my hands; but who the
person was that snatched it, I saw not.

##### <span id="ii.ii.ii-p4.4"></span>Chap. II.

<span id="ii.ii.ii-p5"></span>Fifteen days after, when I had fasted and
prayed much to the Lord, the knowledge of the writing was revealed to
me. Now the writing was to this effect: “Your seed, O Hermas, has sinned
against God, and they have blasphemed against <span
id="fr_57"></span>[58](#fn_57.md) the Lord, and in their great wickedness
they have betrayed their parents. And they passed as traitors of their
parents, and by their treachery did they not <span
id="fr_58"></span>[59](#fn_58.md) reap profit. And even now they have added
to their sins lusts and iniquitous pollutions, and thus their iniquities
have been filled up. But make known <span id="fr_59"></span>[60](#fn_59.md)
these words to all your children, and to your wife, who is to be your
sister. For she does not <span id="fr_60"></span>[61](#fn_60.md) restrain
her tongue, with which she commits iniquity; but, on hearing these
words, she will control herself, and will obtain mercy. For after you
have made known to them these words which my Lord has commanded me to
reveal to you, <span id="fr_61"></span>[62](#fn_61.md) then shall they be
forgiven all the sins which in former times they committed, and
forgiveness will be granted to all the saints who have sinned even to
the present day, if they repent with all their heart, and drive all
doubts from their minds. <span id="fr_62"></span>[63](#fn_62.md) For the
Lord has sworn by His glory, in regard to His elect, that if any one of
them sin after a certain day which has been fixed, he shall not be
saved. For the repentance of the righteous has limits. <span
id="fr_63"></span>[64](#fn_63.md) Filled up are the days of repentance to
all the saints; but to the heathen, repentance will be possible even to
the last day. You will tell, therefore, those who preside over the
Church, to direct their ways in righteousness, that they may receive in
full the promises with great glory. Stand stedfast, therefore, ye who
work righteousness, and doubt not, <span id="fr_64"></span>[65](#fn_64.md)
that your passage <span id="fr_65"></span>[66](#fn_65.md) may be with the
holy angels. Happy ye who endure the great tribulation that is coming
on, and happy they who shall not deny their own life. <span
id="fr_66"></span>[67](#fn_66.md) For the Lord hath sworn by His Son, that
those who denied their Lord have abandoned their life in despair, for
even now these are to deny Him in the days that are coming. <span
id="fr_67"></span>[68](#fn_67.md) To those who denied in earlier times, God
became <span id="fr_68"></span>[69](#fn_68.md) gracious, on account of His
exceeding tender mercy.”

##### <span id="ii.ii.ii-p17.1"></span>Chap. III.

<span id="ii.ii.ii-p18"></span>“But as for you, Hermas, remember not the
wrongs done to you by your children, nor neglect your sister, that they
may be cleansed from their former sins. For they will be instructed with
righteous instruction, if you remember not the wrongs they have done
you. For the remembrance <span id="page_12">p. 12</span> <span
id="ii.ii.ii-Page_12"></span>of wrongs worketh death. <span
id="fr_69"></span>[70](#fn_69.md) And you, Hermas, have endured great
personal <span id="fr_70"></span>[71](#fn_70.md) tribulations on account of
the transgressions of your house, because you did not attend to them,
but were careless <span id="fr_71"></span>[72](#fn_71.md) and engaged in
your wicked transactions. But <span id="fr_72"></span>[73](#fn_72.md) you
are saved, because you did not depart from the living God, and on
account of your simplicity and great self-control. These have saved you,
if you remain stedfast. And they will save all who act in the same
manner, and walk in guilelessness and simplicity. Those who possess such
virtues will wax strong against every form of wickedness, and will abide
unto eternal life. Blessed are all they who practice righteousness, for
they shall never be destroyed. Now you will tell Maximus: Lo! <span
id="fr_73"></span>[74](#fn_73.md) tribulation cometh on. If it seemeth good
to thee, deny again. The Lord is near to them who return unto Him, as it
is written in Eldad and Modat, <span id="fr_74"></span>[75](#fn_74.md) who
prophesied to the people in the wilderness.”

##### <span id="ii.ii.ii-p24.3"></span>Chap. IV.

<span id="ii.ii.ii-p25"></span>Now a revelation was given to me, my
brethren, while I slept, by a young man of comely appearance, who said
to me, “Who do you think that old woman is from whom you received the
book?” And I said, “The Sibyl.” “You are in a mistake,” says he; “it is
not the Sibyl.” “Who is it then?” say I. And he said, “It is the
Church.” <span id="fr_75"></span>[76](#fn_75.md) And I said to him, “Why
then is she an old woman?” “Because,” said he, “she was created first of
all. On this account is she old. And for her sake was the world made.”
After that I saw a vision in my house, and that old woman came and asked
me, if I had yet given the book to the presbyters. And I said that I had
not. And then she said, “You have done well, for I have some words to
add. But when I finish all the words, all the elect will then become
acquainted with them through you. You will write therefore two books,
and you will send the one to Clemens and the other to Grapte. <span
id="fr_76"></span>[77](#fn_76.md) And Clemens will send his to foreign
countries, for permission has been granted to him to do so. <span
id="fr_77"></span>[78](#fn_77.md) And Grapte will admonish the widows and
the orphans. But you will read the words in this city, along with the
presbyters who preside over the Church.”

26](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#026)<span id="ii.ii.ii-p15.2"></span>..md)
The great tribuation here referred to, is probably that mystery of St.
Paul ([2 Thess. ii. 3](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#003.md)<span
id="ii.ii.ii-p15.3"></span>), which they supposed nigh at hand. Our
author probably saw signs of it in Montanus and his followers.\]

id="ii.ii.ii-p15.4"></span>

<span id="ii.ii.ii-p16"></span> *Those … coming*. The meaning of this
sentence is obscure. The Vat. is evidently corrupt, but seems to mean:
“The Lord has sworn by His Son, that whoever will deny Him and His Son,
promising themselves life thereby, they \[God and His Son\] will deny
them in the days that are to come.” The days that are to come would mean
the day of judgment and the future state. See [Matt. x.
33](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#033.md)<span id="ii.ii.ii-p16.1"></span>.
\[This they supposed would soon follow the great apostasy and
tribulation. The words “earlier times” are against the Pauline date.\]

<span id="ii.ii.ii-p19"></span> The Vat. adds: but forgetfulness of
them, eternal life. \[[Lev. xix.
18](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#018.md)<span id="ii.ii.ii-p19.1"></span>.

“easy-minded.”\]

<span id="ii.ii.ii-p22"></span> But you will be saved for not having
departed from the living God. And your simplicity and singular
self-control will save you, if you remain stedfast.—*Vat*.

id="ii.ii.ii-p23.1"></span>

<span id="ii.ii.ii-p24"></span> \[The sense is: This is the temptation
of those who pervert the promises made to the penitent. They may say,
“we are threatened with terrible persecution; let us save our lives by
momentarily denying Christ: we can *turn again*, and the Lord is nigh to
all who thus turn, as Eldad and Medad told the Israelites.”\] Eldad (or
Eldat or Heldat or Heldam) and Modat (Mudat or Modal) are mentioned in
[Num. 11:26](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#026.md),

<span id="ii.ii.ii-p27"></span> Grapte is supposed to have been a
deaconess.

id="ii.ii.ii-p27.1"></span>

<span id="ii.ii.ii-p28"></span> \[Here, as in places that follow, is to
be noted a development of canon law, that could hardly have existed in
the days of the Pauline Hermas. He is supposed to be a lector, who might
read for the edification of the elect, if permitted by the presbyters.
Grapte, the deaconess, is supposed to have charge of widows and orphans;
while Clement, only, has canonical right to authenticate books to
foreign churches, as the Eastern bishops were accustomed to authenticate
canonical Scriptures to him and others. The second Hermas falls into
such anachronisms innocently, but they betray the fiction of his work.
Compare the *Apost. Constitutions* with (apocryphal) authentications by
Clement.\]
