##### <span id="iii.ii.xvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVI.—Vain Display of Power by the Demons.

<span id="iii.ii.xvi-p1"></span>But the demons <span
id="fr_469"></span>[470](#fn_469.md) who rule over men are not the souls of
men; for how should these be capable of action after death? unless man,
who while living was void of understanding and power, should be believed
when dead to be endowed with more of active power. But neither could
this be the case, as we have shown elsewhere. <span
id="fr_470"></span>[471](#fn_470.md) And it is difficult to conceive that
the immortal soul, which is impeded by the members of the body, should
become more intelligent when it has migrated from it. For the demons,
inspired with frenzy against men by reason of their own wickedness,
pervert their minds, which already incline downwards, by various
deceptive scenic representations, that they may be disabled from rising
to the path that leads to heaven. But from us the things which are in
the world are not hidden, and the divine is easily apprehended by us if
the power that makes souls immortal visits us. The demons are seen also
by the men possessed of soul, when, as sometimes, they exhibit
themselves to men, either that they may be thought to be something, or
as evil-disposed friends may do harm to them as to enemies, or afford
occasions of doing them honour to those who resemble them. For, if it
were possible, they would without doubt pull down heaven itself with the
rest of creation. But now this they can by no means effect, for they
have not the power; but they make war by means of the lower matter
against the matter that is like themselves. Should any one wish to
conquer them, let him repudiate matter. Being armed with the
breastplate <span id="fr_471"></span>[472](#fn_471.md) of the celestial
Spirit, he will be able to preserve all that is encompassed by it. There
are, indeed, diseases and disturbances of the matter that is in us; but,
when such things happen, the demons ascribe the causes of them to
themselves, and approach a man whenever disease lays hold of him.
Sometimes they themselves disturb the habit of the body by a tempest of
folly; but, being smitten by the word of God, they depart in terror, and
the sick man is healed.
