##### <span id="vi.iii.iii.ix-p0.1"></span>Chapter IX.—Why We are to Use the Bath.

<span id="vi.iii.iii.ix-p1"></span>There are, then, four reasons for the
bath (for from that point I digressed in my oration), for which we
frequent it: for cleanliness, or heat, or health, or lastly, for
pleasure. Bathing for pleasure is to be omitted. For unblushing pleasure
must be cut out by the roots; and the bath is to be taken by women for
cleanliness and health, by men for health alone. <span
id="fr_1652"></span>[1653](#fn_1652) To bathe for the sake of heat is a
superfluity, since one may restore what is frozen by the cold in other
ways. Constant use of the bath, too, impairs strength and relaxes the
physical energies, and often induces debility and fainting. For in a
<span id="page_283">p. 283</span> <span
id="vi.iii.iii.ix-Page_283"></span>way the body drinks, like trees, not
only by the mouth, but also over the whole body in bathing, by what they
call the pores. In proof of this often people, when thirsty, by going
afterwards into the water, have assuaged their thirst. Unless, then, the
bath is for some use, we ought not to indulge in it. The ancients called
them places for fulling <span id="fr_1653"></span>[1654](#fn_1653) men,
since they wrinkle men’s bodies sooner than they ought, and by cooking
them, as it were, compel them to become prematurely old. The flesh, like
iron, being softened by the heat, hence we require cold, as it were, to
temper and give an edge. Nor must we bathe always; but if one is a
little exhausted, or, on the other hand, filled to repletion, the bath
is to be forbidden, regard being had to the age of the body and the
season of the year. For the bath is not beneficial to all, or always, as
those who are skilled in these things own. But due proportion, which on
all occasions we call as our helper in life, suffices for us. For we
must not so use the bath as to require an assistant, nor are we to bathe
constantly and often in the day as we frequent the market-place. But to
have the water poured over us by several people is an outrage on our
neighbours, through fondness for luxuriousness, and is done by those who
will not understand that the bath is common to all the bathers equally.

<span id="vi.iii.iii.ix-p4"></span>But most of all is it necessary to
wash the soul in the cleansing Word (sometimes the body too, on account
of the dirt which gathers and grows to it, sometimes also to relieve
fatigue). “Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!” saith the
Lord, “for ye are like to whited sepulchres. Without, the sepulchre
appears beautiful, but within it is full of dead men’s bones and all
uncleanness.” <span id="fr_1654"></span>[1655](#fn_1654) And again He
says to the same people, “Woe unto you! for ye cleanse the outside of
the cup and platter, but within are full of uncleanness. Cleanse first
the inside of the cup, that the outside may be clean also.” <span
id="fr_1655"></span>[1656](#fn_1655) The best bath, then, is what rubs
off the pollution of the soul, and is spiritual. Of which prophecy
speaks expressly: “The Lord will wash away the filth of the sons and
daughters of Israel, and will purge the blood from the midst of
them” <span id="fr_1656"></span>[1657](#fn_1656) —the blood of crime and
the murders of the prophets. And the mode of cleansing, the Word
subjoined, saying, “by the spirit of judgment and the spirit of
burning.” The bathing which is carnal, that is to say, of the body, is
accomplished by water alone, as often in the country where there is not
a bath. <span id="fr_1657"></span>[1658](#fn_1657)
