#### <span id="ii.ii.iv-p0.1"></span>Vision Fourth.

##### <span id="ii.ii.iv-p0.2"></span>Concerning the Trial and Tribulation that are to Come Upon Men.

##### <span id="ii.ii.iv-p0.3"></span>Chap. I.

<span id="ii.ii.iv-p1"></span>Twenty days after the former vision I saw
another vision, brethren <span id="fr_128"></span>[129](#fn_128) —a
representation of the tribulation <span
id="fr_129"></span>[130](#fn_129) that is to come. I was going to a
country house along the Campanian road. Now the house lay about ten
furlongs from the public road. The district is one rarely <span
id="fr_130"></span>[131](#fn_130) traversed. And as I walked alone, I
prayed the Lord to complete the revelations which He had made to me
through His holy Church, that He might strengthen me, <span
id="fr_131"></span>[132](#fn_131) and give repentance to all His
servants who were going astray, that His great and glorious name might
be glorified because He vouchsafed to show me His marvels. <span
id="fr_132"></span>[133](#fn_132) And while I was glorifying Him and
giving Him thanks, a voice, as it were, answered me, “Doubt not,
Hermas;” and I began to think with myself, and to say, “What reason have
I to doubt—I who have been established by the Lord, and who have seen
such glorious sights?” I advanced a little, brethren, and, lo! I see
dust rising even to the heavens. I began to say to myself, “Are cattle
approaching and raising the dust?” It was about a furlong’s distance
from me. And, <span id="page_18">p. 18</span> <span
id="ii.ii.iv-Page_18"></span>lo! I see the dust rising more and more, so
that I imagined that it was something sent from God. But the sun now
shone out a little, and, lo! I see a mighty beast like a whale, and out
of its mouth fiery locusts <span id="fr_133"></span>[134](#fn_133)
proceeded. But the size of that beast was about a hundred feet, and it
had a head like an urn. <span id="fr_134"></span>[135](#fn_134) I began
to weep, and to call on the Lord to rescue me from it. Then I remembered
the word which I had heard, “Doubt not, O Hermas.” Clothed, therefore,
my brethren, with faith in the Lord <span
id="fr_135"></span>[136](#fn_135) and remembering the great things which
He had taught me, I boldly faced the beast. Now that beast came on with
such noise and force, that it could itself have destroyed a city. <span
id="fr_136"></span>[137](#fn_136) I came near it, and the monstrous
beast stretched itself out on the ground, and showed nothing but its
tongue, and did not stir at all until I had passed by it. Now the beast
had four colours on its head—black, then fiery and bloody, then golden,
and lastly white.

##### <span id="ii.ii.iv-p10.1"></span>Chap. II.

<span id="ii.ii.iv-p11"></span>Now after I had passed by the wild beast,
and had moved forward about thirty feet, lo! a virgin meets me, adorned
as if she were proceeding from the bridal chamber, clothed entirely in
white, and with white sandals, and veiled up to her forehead, and her
head was covered by a hood. <span id="fr_137"></span>[138](#fn_137) And
she had white hair. I knew from my former visions that this was the
Church, and I became more joyful. She saluted me, and said, “Hail, O
man!” And I returned her salutation, and said, “Lady, hail!” And she
answered, and said to me, “Has nothing crossed your path?” I say, “I was
met by a beast of such a size that it could destroy peoples, but through
the power of the Lord <span id="fr_138"></span>[139](#fn_138) and His
great mercy I escaped from it.” “Well did you escape from it,” says she,
“because you cast your care <span id="fr_139"></span>[140](#fn_139) on
God, <span id="fr_140"></span>[141](#fn_140) and opened your heart to
the Lord, believing that you can be saved by no other than by His great
and glorious name. <span id="fr_141"></span>[142](#fn_141) On this
account the Lord has sent His angel, who has rule over the beasts, and
whose name is Thegri, <span id="fr_142"></span>[143](#fn_142) and has
shut up its mouth, so that it cannot tear you. You have escaped from
great tribulation on account of your faith, and because you did not
doubt in the presence of such a beast. Go, therefore, and tell the elect
of the Lord <span id="fr_143"></span>[144](#fn_143) His mighty deeds,
and say to them that this beast is a type of the great tribulation that
is coming. If then ye prepare yourselves, and repent with all your
heart, and turn to the Lord, it will be possible for you to escape it,
if your heart be pure and spotless, and ye spend the rest of the days of
your life in serving the Lord blamelessly. Cast your cares upon the
Lord, and He will direct them. Trust the Lord, ye who doubt, for He is
all-powerful, and can turn His anger away from you, and send
scourges <span id="fr_144"></span>[145](#fn_144) on the doubters. Woe to
those who hear these words, and despise them: <span
id="fr_145"></span>[146](#fn_145) better were it for them not to have
been born.” <span id="fr_146"></span>[147](#fn_146)

##### <span id="ii.ii.iv-p21.2"></span>Chap. III.

<span id="ii.ii.iv-p22"></span>I asked her about the four colours which
the beast had on his head. And she answered, and said to me, “Again you
are inquisitive in regard to such matters.” “Yea, Lady,” said I, “make
known to me what they are.” “Listen,” said she: “the black is the world
in which we dwell: but the fiery and bloody points out that the world
must perish through blood and fire: but the golden part are you who have
escaped from this world. For as gold is tested by fire, and thus becomes
useful, so are you tested who dwell in it. Those, therefore, who
continue stedfast, and are put through the fire, will be purified by
means of it. For as gold casts away its dross, so also will ye cast away
all sadness and straitness, and will be made pure so as to fit into the
building of the tower. But the white part is the age that is to come, in
which the elect of God will dwell, since those elected by God to eternal
life will be spotless and pure. Wherefore cease not speaking these
things into the ears of the saints. This then is the type of the great
tribulation that is to come. If ye wish it, it will be nothing. Remember
those things which were written down before.” And saying this, she
departed. But I saw not into what place she retired. There was a noise,
however, and I turned round in alarm, thinking that that beast was
coming. <span id="fr_147"></span>[148](#fn_147)
