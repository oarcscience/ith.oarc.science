##### <span id="iii.ii.xxix-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXIX.—Account of Tatian’s Conversion.

<span id="iii.ii.xxix-p1"></span>Wherefore, having seen these things,
and moreover also having been admitted to the mysteries, and having
everywhere examined the religious rites performed by the effeminate and
the pathic, and having found among the Romans their Latiarian Jupiter
delighting in human gore and the blood of slaughtered men, and Artemis
not far from the great city <span id="fr_497"></span>[498](#fn_497.md)
sanctioning acts of the same kind, and one demon here and another there
instigating to the perpetration of evil,—retiring by myself, I sought
how I might be able to discover the truth. And, while I was giving my
most earnest attention to the matter, I happened to meet with certain
barbaric writings, too old to be compared with the opinions of the
Greeks, and too divine to be compared with their errors; and I was led
to put faith in these by the unpretending cast of the language, the
inartificial character of the writers, the foreknowledge displayed of
future events, the excellent quality of the precepts, and the
declaration of the government of the universe as centred in one
Being. <span id="fr_498"></span>[499](#fn_498.md) And, my soul being taught
of God, I discern that the former class of writings lead to
condemnation, but that these put an end to the slavery that is in the
world, and rescue us from a multiplicity of rulers and ten thousand
tyrants, while they give us, not indeed what we had not before received,
but what we had received but were prevented by error from retaining.

light-giving power of the Holy Scriptures. “Barbarian books” (*barbaric*
means something else) they were; but well says Dr. Watts in a paraphrase
