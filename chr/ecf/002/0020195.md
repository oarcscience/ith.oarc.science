##### <span id="v.ii.xxv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXV.—The Poets and Philosophers Have Denied a Divine Providence.

<span id="v.ii.xxv-p1"></span>These angels, then, who have fallen from
heaven, and haunt the air and the earth, and are no longer able to rise
to heavenly things, and the souls of the giants, which are the demons
who wander about the world, perform actions similar, the one (that is,
the demons) to the natures they have received, the other (that is, the
angels) to the appetites they have indulged. But the prince of matter,
as may be seen merely from what transpires, exercises a control and
management contrary to the good that is in God:—

> <span id="v.ii.xxv-p1.1"></span> “Ofttimes this anxious thought has
> crossed my mind,  
> Whether ’tis chance or deity that rules  
> The small affairs of men; and, spite of hope  
> As well as justice, drives to exile some  
> Stripped of all means of life, while others still  
> Continue to enjoy prosperity.” <span
> id="fr_789"></span>[790](#fn_789)  

<span id="v.ii.xxv-p3"></span>Prosperity and adversity, contrary to hope
and justice, made it impossible for Euripides to say to whom belongs the
administration of earthly affairs, which is of such a kind that one
might say of it:—

> <span id="v.ii.xxv-p3.1"></span> “How then, while seeing these things,
> can we say  
> There is a race of gods, or yield to laws?” <span
> id="fr_790"></span>[791](#fn_790)  

<span id="v.ii.xxv-p5"></span>The same thing led Aristotle to say that
the things below the heaven are not under the care of Providence,
although the eternal providence of God concerns itself equally with us
below,—

> <span id="v.ii.xxv-p5.1"></span> “The earth, let willingness move her
> or not,  
> Must herbs produce, and thus sustain my flocks,” <span
> id="fr_791"></span>[792](#fn_791) —  

<span id="v.ii.xxv-p7"></span>and addresses itself to the deserving
individually, according to truth and not according to opinion; and all
other things, according to the general constitution of nature, are
provided for by the law of reason. But because the demoniac movements
and operations proceeding from the adverse spirit produce these
disorderly sallies, and moreover move men, some in one way and some in
another, as individuals and as nations, separately and in common, in
accordance with the tendency of matter on the one hand, and of the
affinity for divine things on the other, from within and from
without,—some who are of no mean reputation have therefore thought that
this universe is constituted without any definite order, and is driven
hither and thither by an irrational chance. But they do not understand,
that of those things which belong to the constitution of the whole world
there is nothing out of order or neglected, but that each one of them
has been produced by reason, and that, therefore, they do not transgress
the order prescribed to them; and that man himself, too, so far as He
that made him is concerned, is well ordered, both by his original
nature, which has one common character for all, and by the constitution
of his body, which does not transgress the law imposed upon <span
id="page_143">p. 143</span> <span id="v.ii.xxv-Page_143"></span>it, and
by the termination of his life, which remains equal and common to all
alike; <span id="fr_792"></span>[793](#fn_792) but that, according to
the character peculiar to himself and the operation of the ruling prince
and of the demons his followers, he is impelled and moved in this
direction or in that, notwithstanding that all possess in common the
same original constitution of mind. <span
