##### <span id="vi.iv.iv.ii-p0.1"></span>Chapter II.—The Meaning of the Name Stromata or Miscellanies.

<span id="vi.iv.iv.ii-p1"></span>Let these notes of ours, as we have
often said for the sake of those that consult them carelessly and
unskilfully, be of varied character—and as the name itself indicates,
patched together—passing constantly from one thing to another, and in
the series of discussions hinting at one thing and demonstrating
another. “For those who seek for gold,” says Heraclitus, “dig much earth
and find little gold.” But those who are of the truly golden race, in
mining for what is allied to them, will find the much in little. For the
word will find one to understand it. The Miscellanies of notes
contribute, then, to the recollection and expression of truth in the
case of him who is able to investigate with reason. <span
id="page_410">p. 410</span> <span id="vi.iv.iv.ii-Page_410"></span>And
you must prosecute, in addition to these, other labours and researches;
since, in the case of people who are setting out on a road with which
they are unacquainted, it is sufficient merely to point out the
direction. After this they must walk and find out the rest for
themselves. As, they say, when a certain slave once asked at the oracle
what he should do to please his master, the Pythian priestess replied,
“You will find if you seek.” It is truly a difficult matter, then, as
turns out, to find out latent good; since

> <span id="vi.iv.iv.ii-p1.1"></span> “Before virtue is placed
> exertion,  
> And long and steep is the way to it,  
> And rough at first; but when the summit is reached,  
> Then is it easy, though difficult \[before\].”  

<span id="vi.iv.iv.ii-p2"></span>“For narrow,” in truth, “and strait is
the way” of the Lord. And it is to the “violent that the kingdom of God
belongs.” <span id="fr_2679"></span>[2680](#fn_2679)

<span id="vi.iv.iv.ii-p4"></span>Whence, “Seek, and ye shall find,”
holding on by the truly royal road, and not deviating. As we might
expect, then, the generative power of the seeds of the doctrines
comprehended in this treatise is great in small space, as the “universal
herbage of the field,” <span id="fr_2680"></span>[2681](#fn_2680) as
Scripture saith. Thus the Miscellanies of notes have their proper title,
wonderfully like that ancient oblation culled from all sorts of things
of which Sophocles writes:—

> <span id="vi.iv.iv.ii-p5.2"></span> “For there was a sheep’s fleece,
> and there was a vine,  
> And a libation, and grapes well stored;  
> And there was mixed with it fruit of all kinds,  
> And the fat of the olive, and the most curious  
> Wax-formed work of the yellow bee.”  

<span id="vi.iv.iv.ii-p6"></span>Just so our *Stromata*, according to
the husbandman of the comic poet Timocles, produce “figs, olives, dried
figs, honey, as from an all-fruitful field;” on account of which
exuberance he adds:—

> <span id="vi.iv.iv.ii-p6.1"></span> “Thou speakest of a harvest-wreath
> not of husbandry.”  

<span id="vi.iv.iv.ii-p7"></span>For the Athenians were wont to cry:—

> <span id="vi.iv.iv.ii-p7.1"></span> “The harvest-wreath bears figs and
> fat loaves,  
> And honey in a cup, and olive oil to anoint you.”  

<span id="vi.iv.iv.ii-p8"></span>We must then often, as in winnowing
sieves, shake and toss up this the great mixture of seeds, in order to
separate the wheat.
