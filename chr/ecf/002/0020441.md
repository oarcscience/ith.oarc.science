#### <span id="vi.iv.ix-p1.2"></span>I.—From the Latin Translation of Cassiodorus. <span id="fr_3711"></span>[3712](#fn_3711.md)

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p2.2"></span>

##### <span id="vi.iv.ix-p2.3"></span>I.—Comments <span id="fr_3712"></span>[3713](#fn_3712.md) On the <span id="vi.iv.ix-p3.2"></span>First Epistle of Peter.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="vi.iv.ix-p4.1"></span>Chap. i. 3.</span> “Blessed be the God and
Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who by His great mercy hath regenerated
us.” For if God generated us of matter, He afterwards, by progress in
life, regenerated us.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p5"></span>“The Father of our Lord, by the
resurrection of Jesus Christ:” who, according to your faith, rises again
in us; as, on the other hand, He dies in us, through the operation of
our unbelief. For He said again, that the soul never returns a second
time to the body in this life; and that which has become angelic does
not become unrighteous or evil, so as not to have the opportunity of
again sinning by the assumption of flesh; but that in the resurrection
the soul <span id="fr_3713"></span>[3714](#fn_3713.md) returns to the body,
and both are joined to one another according to their peculiar nature,
adapting themselves, through the composition of each, by a kind of
congruity like <span id="fr_3714"></span>[3715](#fn_3714.md) a building of
stones.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p7.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p8"></span>Besides, Peter says, <span
id="fr_3715"></span>[3716](#fn_3715.md) “Ye also, as living stones, are
built up a spiritual house;” meaning the place of the angelic abode,
guarded in heaven <span id="fr_3716"></span>[3717](#fn_3716.md) . “For
you,” he says, “who are kept by the power of God, by faith and
contemplation, to receive the end of your faith, the salvation of your
souls.”

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p10.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p11"></span>Hence it appears that the soul is not
naturally immortal; but is made immortal by the grace of God, through
faith and righteousness, and by knowledge. “Of which salvation,” he
says, <span id="fr_3717"></span>[3718](#fn_3717.md) “the prophets have
inquired and searched diligently,” and what follows. It is declared by
this that the prophets spake with wisdom, and that the Spirit of Christ
was in them, according to the possession of Christ, and in subjection to
Christ. For God works through archangels and kindred angels, who are
called spirits of Christ.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p12.2"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p13"></span>“Which are now,” he says, <span
id="fr_3718"></span>[3719](#fn_3718.md) “reported unto you by them that
have preached the Gospel unto you.” The old things which were done by
the prophets and escape the observation of most, are now revealed to you
by the evangelists. “For to you,” he says, <span
id="fr_3719"></span>[3720](#fn_3719.md) “they are manifested by the Holy
Ghost, who was sent;” that is the Paraclete, of whom the Lord said, “If
I go not away, He will not come.” <span
id="fr_3720"></span>[3721](#fn_3720.md) “Unto whom,” <span
id="fr_3721"></span>[3722](#fn_3721.md) it is said, “the angels desire to
look;” not the apostate angels, as most suspect, but, what is a divine
truth, angels who desire to obtain the advantage of that perfection.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p17.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p18"></span>“By precious blood,” he says, <span
id="fr_3722"></span>[3723](#fn_3722.md) “as of a lamb without blemish and
without spot.” Here he touches on the ancient Levitical and sacerdotal
celebrations; but means a soul pure through righteousness which is
offered to God.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p19.2"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p20"></span>“Verily foreknown before the foundation
of the world.” <span id="fr_3723"></span>[3724](#fn_3723.md) Inasmuch as He
was foreknown before every creature, because He was Christ. <span
id="vi.iv.ix-p21.2"></span> <span id="page_572">p. 572</span> <span
id="vi.iv.ix-Page_572"></span>“But manifested in the last times” by the
generation of a body. “Being born again, not of corruptible seed.” <span
id="fr_3724"></span>[3725](#fn_3724.md) The soul, then, which is produced
along with the body is corruptible, as some think.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p22.2"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p23"></span>“But the word of the Lord,” he
says, <span id="fr_3725"></span>[3726](#fn_3725.md) “endureth for ever:” as
well prophecy as divine doctrine.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p24.2"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p25"></span>“But ye are a chosen generation, a royal
priesthood.” <span id="fr_3726"></span>[3727](#fn_3726.md) That we are a
chosen race by the election of God is abundantly clear. He says royal,
because we are called to sovereignty and belong to Christ; and
priesthood on account of the oblation which is made by prayers and
instructions, by which are gained the souls which are offered to God.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p26.2"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p27"></span>“Who, when He was reviled,” he
says, <span id="fr_3727"></span>[3728](#fn_3727.md) “reviled not; when He
suffered, threatened not.” The Lord acted so in His goodness and
patience. “But committed Himself to him that judged Him
unrighteously:” <span id="fr_3728"></span>[3729](#fn_3728.md) whether
Himself, so that, regarding Himself in this way, there is a
transposition. <span id="fr_3729"></span>[3730](#fn_3729.md) He indeed gave
Himself up to those who judged according to an unjust law; because He
was unserviceable to them, inasmuch as He was righteous: or, He
committed to God those who judged unrighteously, and without cause
insisted on His death, so that they might be instructed by suffering
punishment.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p30.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p31"></span>“For he that will love life, and see good
days;” <span id="fr_3730"></span>[3731](#fn_3730.md) that is, who wishes to
become eternal and immortal. And He calls the Lord life, and the days
good, that is holy.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p32.2"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p33"></span>“For the eyes of the Lord,” he says, “are
upon the righteous, and His ears on their prayers:” he means the
manifold inspection of the Holy Spirit. “The face of the Lord is on them
that do evil;” <span id="fr_3731"></span>[3732](#fn_3731.md) that is,
whether judgment, or vengeance, or manifestation.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p34.2"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p35"></span>“But sanctify the Lord Christ,” he says,
“in your hearts.” <span id="fr_3732"></span>[3733](#fn_3732.md) For so you
have in the Lord’s prayer, “Hallowed be Thy name.” <span
id="fr_3733"></span>[3734](#fn_3733.md)

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p37.2"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p38"></span>“For Christ,” he says, <span
id="fr_3734"></span>[3735](#fn_3734.md) “hath once suffered for our sins,
the just for the unjust, that he might present <span
id="fr_3735"></span>[3736](#fn_3735.md) us to God; being put to death in
the flesh, but quickened in the spirit.” He says these things, reducing
them to their faith. That is, He became alive in our spirits.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p40.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p41"></span>“Coming,” he says, <span
id="fr_3736"></span>[3737](#fn_3736.md) “He preached to those who were once
unbelieving.” They saw not His form, but they heard His voice.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p43"></span>“When the long-suffering of God” <span
id="fr_3737"></span>[3738](#fn_3737.md) holds out. God is so good, as to
work the result by the teaching of salvation.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p45"></span>“By the resurrection,” it is said, <span
id="fr_3738"></span>[3739](#fn_3738.md) “of Jesus Christ:” that, namely,
which is effected in us by faith.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p47"></span>“Angels being subjected to Him,” <span
id="fr_3739"></span>[3740](#fn_3739.md) which are the first order; and
“principalities” being subject, who are of the second order; and
“powers” being also subject, which are said to belong to the third
order.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p48.2"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p49"></span>“Who shall give account,” he says, <span
id="fr_3740"></span>[3741](#fn_3740.md) “to Him who is ready to judge the
quick and the dead.”

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p50.2"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p51"></span>These are trained through previous
judgments. <span id="fr_3741"></span>[3742](#fn_3741.md) Therefore he adds,
“For this cause was the Gospel preached also to the dead”—to us, namely,
who were at one time unbelievers. “That they might be judged according
to men,” he says, <span id="fr_3742"></span>[3743](#fn_3742.md) “in the
flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.” Because, that is, they
have fallen away from faith; whilst they are still in the flesh they are
judged according to preceding judgments, that they might repent.
Accordingly, he also adds, saying, “That they might live according to
God in the spirit.” So Paul also; for he, too, states something of this
nature when he says, “Whom I have delivered to Satan, that he might live
in the spirit;” <span id="fr_3743"></span>[3744](#fn_3743.md) that is, “as
good stewards of the manifold grace of God.” Similarly also Paul says,
“Variously, and in many ways, God of old spake to our fathers.” <span
id="fr_3744"></span>[3745](#fn_3744.md)

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p55.2"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p56"></span>“Rejoice,” it is said, <span
id="fr_3745"></span>[3746](#fn_3745.md) “that ye are partakers in the
sufferings of Christ:” that is, if ye are righteous, ye suffer for
righteousness’ sake, as Christ suffered for righteousness. “Happy are
ye, for the Spirit of God, who is the Spirit of His glory and virtue,
resteth on you.” This possessive “His” signifies also an an angelic
spirit: inasmuch as the glory of God those are, through whom, according
to faith and righteousness, He is glorified, to honourable glory,
according to the advancement of the saints who are brought in. “The
Spirit of God on us,” may be thus understood; that is, who through faith
comes on the soul, like a gracefulness of mind and beauty of soul.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p57.2"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p58"></span>“Since,” it is said, <span
id="fr_3746"></span>[3747](#fn_3746.md) “it is time for judgment beginning
at the house of God.” For judgment will overtake these in the appointed
persecutions.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p59.2"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p60"></span>“But the God of all grace,” he
says. <span id="fr_3747"></span>[3748](#fn_3747.md) “Of all grace,” he
says, because He is good, and the giver of all good things.

<span id="page_573">p. 573</span> <span id="vi.iv.ix-Page_573"></span>
<span id="vi.iv.ix-p61.2"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p62"></span>“Marcus, my son, saluteth you.” <span
id="fr_3748"></span>[3749](#fn_3748.md) Mark, the follower of Peter, while
Peter publicly preached the Gospel at Rome before some of Cæsar’s
equites, and adduced many testimonies to Christ, in order that thereby
they might be able to commit to memory what was spoken, of what was
spoken by Peter, wrote entirely what is called the Gospel according to
Mark. As Luke also may be recognised <span
id="fr_3749"></span>[3750](#fn_3749.md) by the style, both to have composed
the Acts of the Apostles, and to have translated Paul’s Epistle to the
Hebrews.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p64.1"></span>

##### <span id="vi.iv.ix-p64.2"></span>II.—Comments on the Epistle of Jude.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p65"></span>Jude, who wrote the Catholic Epistle, the
brother of the sons of Joseph, and very religious, whilst knowing the
near relationship of the Lord, yet did not say that he himself was His
brother. But what said he? <span id="fr_3750"></span>[3751](#fn_3750.md)
“Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ,”—of Him as Lord; but “the brother of
James.” For this is true; he was His brother, (the son) <span
id="fr_3751"></span>[3752](#fn_3751.md) of Joseph. “For <span
id="fr_3752"></span>[3753](#fn_3752.md) certain men have entered unawares,
ungodly men, who had been of old ordained and predestined to the
judgment of our God;” not that they might become impious, but that,
being now impious, they were ordained to judgment. “For the Lord God,”
he says, <span id="fr_3753"></span>[3754](#fn_3753.md) “who once delivered
a people out of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not;” that
is, that He might train them through punishment. For they were indeed
punished, and they perished on account of those that are saved, until
they turn to the Lord. “But the angels,” he says, <span
id="fr_3754"></span>[3755](#fn_3754.md) “that kept not their own
pre-eminence,” that, namely, which they received through advancement,
“but left their own habitation,” meaning, that is, the heaven and the
stars, became, and are called apostates. “He hath reserved these to the
judgment of the great day, in chains, under darkness.” He means the
place near the earth, <span id="fr_3755"></span>[3756](#fn_3755.md) that
is, the dark air. Now he called “chains” the loss of the honour in which
they had stood, and the lust of feeble things; since, bound by their own
lust, they cannot be converted. “As Sodom and Gomorrha,” he says. <span
id="fr_3756"></span>[3757](#fn_3756.md) … By which the Lord signifies that
pardon had been granted; <span id="fr_3757"></span>[3758](#fn_3757.md) and
that on being disciplined they had repented. “Similarly <span
id="fr_3758"></span>[3759](#fn_3758.md) to the same,” he says, <span
id="fr_3759"></span>[3760](#fn_3759.md) “also those dreamers,”—that is, who
dream in their imagination lusts and wicked desires, regarding as good
not that which is truly good, and superior to all good,—“defile the
flesh, despise dominion, and speak evil of majesty,” that is, the only
Lord, <span id="fr_3760"></span>[3761](#fn_3760.md) who is truly our Lord,
Jesus Christ, and alone worthy of praise. They “speak evil of majesty,”
that is, of the angels.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p77"></span>“When Michael, the archangel, <span
id="fr_3761"></span>[3762](#fn_3761.md) disputing with the devil, debated
about the body of Moses.” Here he confirms the assumption of Moses. He
is here called Michael, who through an angel near to us debated with the
devil.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p79"></span>“But these,” he says, <span
id="fr_3762"></span>[3763](#fn_3762.md) “speak evil of those things which
they know not; but what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in these
things they corrupt themselves.” He means that they eat, and drink, and
indulge in uncleanness, and says that they do other things that are
common to them with animals, devoid of reason.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p81"></span>“Woe unto them!” he says, <span
id="fr_3763"></span>[3764](#fn_3763.md) “for they have gone in the way of
Cain.” For so also we lie under Adam’s sin through similarity of sin.
“Clouds,” he says, <span id="fr_3764"></span>[3765](#fn_3764.md) “without
water; who do not possess in themselves the divine and fruitful word.”
Wherefore, he says, “men of this kind are carried about both by winds
and violent blasts.” <span id="fr_3765"></span>[3766](#fn_3765.md) “Trees,”
he says, “of autumn, without fruit,”—unbelievers, that is, who bear no
fruit of fidelity. “Twice dead,” he says: once, namely, when they sinned
by transgressing, and a second time when delivered up to punishment,
according to the predestined judgments of God; inasmuch as it is to be
reckoned death, even when each one does not forthwith deserve the
inheritance. “Waves,” he says, <span
id="fr_3766"></span>[3767](#fn_3766.md) “of a raging sea.” By these words
he signifies the life of the Gentiles, whose end is abominable
ambition. <span id="fr_3767"></span>[3768](#fn_3767.md) “Wandering
stars,”—that is, he means those who err and are apostates are of that
kind of stars which fell from the seats of the angels—“to whom,” for
their apostasy, “the blackness of darkness is reserved for ever. Enoch
also, the seventh from Adam,” he says, <span
id="fr_3768"></span>[3769](#fn_3768.md) “prophesied of these.” In these
words he verities the prophecy.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p88"></span>“Those,” he says, <span
id="fr_3769"></span>[3770](#fn_3769.md) “separating” the faithful from the
unfaithful, be convicted according to their own unbelief. And again
those separating from the flesh. <span
id="fr_3770"></span>[3771](#fn_3770.md) He says, “Animal <span
id="fr_3771"></span>[3772](#fn_3771.md) not having <span id="page_574">p.
574</span> <span id="vi.iv.ix-Page_574"></span>the spirit;” that is, the
spirit which is by faith, which supervenes through the practice of
righteousness.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p92"></span>“But ye, beloved,” he says, <span
id="fr_3772"></span>[3773](#fn_3772.md) “building up yourselves on your
most holy faith, in the Holy Spirit.” “But some,” he says, <span
id="fr_3773"></span>[3774](#fn_3773.md) “save, plucking them from the
fire;” <span id="fr_3774"></span>[3775](#fn_3774.md) “but of some have
compassion in fear,” that is, teach those who fall into the fire to free
themselves. “Hating,” he says, <span
id="fr_3775"></span>[3776](#fn_3775.md) “that spotted garment, which is
carnal:” that of the soul, namely; the spotted garment is a spirit
polluternal lusts. <span id="fr_3776"></span>[3777](#fn_3776.md)

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p98"></span>“Now to Him,” he says, <span
id="fr_3777"></span>[3778](#fn_3777.md) “who is able to keep you without
stumbling, and present you faultless before the presence of His glory in
joy.” In the presence of His glory: he means in the presence of the
angels, to be presented faultless, having become angels. <span
id="fr_3778"></span>[3779](#fn_3778.md) When Daniel speaks of the people
and comes into the presence of the Lord, he does not say this, because
he saw God: for it is impossible that any one whose heart is not pure
should see God; but he says this, that everything that the people did
was in the sight of God, and was manifest to Him; that is, that nothing
is hid from the Lord.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p101"></span>Now, in the Gospel according to Mark,
the Lord being interrogated by the chief of the priests if He was the
Christ, the Son of the blessed God, answering, said, “I am; <span
id="fr_3779"></span>[3780](#fn_3779.md) and ye shall see the Son of man
sitting at the right hand of power.” <span
id="fr_3780"></span>[3781](#fn_3780.md) But powers <span
id="fr_3781"></span>[3782](#fn_3781.md) mean the holy angels. Further, when
He says “at the right hand of God,” He means the self-same \[beings\],
by reason of the equality and likeness of the angelic and holy powers,
which are called by the name of God. He says, therefore, that He sits at
the right hand; that is, that He rests in pre-eminent honour. In the
other Gospels, however, He is said not to have replied to the high
priest, on his asking if He was the Son of God. But what said He? “You
say.” <span id="fr_3782"></span>[3783](#fn_3782.md) Answering sufficiently
well. For had He said, It is as you understand, he would have said what
was not true, not confessing Himself to be the Son of God; \[for\] they
did not entertain this opinion of Him; but by saying “You say,” <span
id="fr_3783"></span>[3784](#fn_3783.md) He spake truly. For what they had
no knowledge of, but expressed in words, that he confessed to be true.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p106.1"></span>

##### <span id="vi.iv.ix-p106.2"></span>III.—Comments on the First Epistle of John.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p107"></span>[1 John
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#001.md)<span id="vi.iv.ix-p107.1"></span>.
“That which was from the beginning; which we have seen with our eyes;
which we have heard.”

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p108"></span>Following the Gospel according to John,
and in accordance with it, this Epistle also contains the spiritual
principle.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p109"></span>What therefore he says, “from the
beginning,” the Presbyter explained to this effect, that the beginning
of generation is not separated from the beginning of the Creator. For
when he says, “That which was from the beginning,” he touches upon the
generation without beginning of the Son, who is co-existent with the
Father. There was; then, a Word importing an unbeginning eternity; as
also the Word itself, that is, the Son of God, who being, by equality of
substance, one with the Father, is eternal and uncreate. That He was
always the Word, is signified by saying, “In the beginning was the
Word.” But by the expression, “we have seen with our eyes,” he signifies
the Lord’s presence in the flesh, “and our hands have handled,” he says,
“of the Word of life.” He means not only His flesh, but the virtues of
the Son, like the sunbeam which penetrates to the lowest places,—this
sunbeam coming in the flesh became palpable to the disciples. It is
accordingly related in traditions, that John, touching the outward body
itself, sent his hand deep down into it, and that the solidity of the
flesh offered no obstacle, but gave way to the hand of the disciple.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p110"></span>“And our hands have handled of the Word
of life;” that is, He who came in the flesh became capable of being
touched. As also,

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p111"></span>[1 John
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#002.md)<span id="vi.iv.ix-p111.1"></span>.
“The life was manifested.” For in the Gospel he thus speaks: “And what
was made, in Him was life, and the life was the light of men.” <span
id="fr_3784"></span>[3785](#fn_3784.md)

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p113"></span>“And we show unto you that eternal life,
which was with the Father, and was manifested unto you.”

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p114"></span>He signifies by the appellation of
Father, that the Son also existed always, without beginning.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p115"></span>[1 John
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#005.md)<span id="vi.iv.ix-p115.1"></span>.
“For God,” he says, “is light.”

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p116"></span>He does not express the divine essence,
but wishing to declare the majesty of God, he has applied to the
Divinity what is best and most excellent in the view of men. Thus also
Paul, when he speaks of “light inaccessible.” <span
id="fr_3785"></span>[3786](#fn_3785.md) But John himself also in this same
Epistle says, “God is love:” <span id="fr_3786"></span>[3787](#fn_3786.md)
pointing out the excellences of God, that He is kind and merciful; and
because He is light, makes men righteous, according to the advancement
of the soul, <span id="page_575">p. 575</span> <span
id="vi.iv.ix-Page_575"></span>through charity. God, then, who is
ineffable in respect of His substance, is light.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p119"></span>“And in Him is no darkness at all,”—that
is, no passion, no keeping up of evil respecting any one, \[He\]
destroys no one, but gives salvation to all. Light moreover signifies,
either the precepts of the Law, or faith, or doctrine. Darkness is the
opposite of these things. Not as if there were another way; since there
is only one way according to the divine precepts. For the work of God is
unity. Duality and all else that exists, except unity, arises from
perversity of life.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p120"></span>[1 John
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#007.md)<span id="vi.iv.ix-p120.1"></span>.
“And the blood of Jesus Christ His Son,” he says, “cleanses us.” For the
doctrine of the Lord, which is very powerful, is called His blood.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p121"></span>[1 John
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#010.md)<span
id="vi.iv.ix-p121.1"></span>. “If we say that we have not sinned, we
make Him a liar, and His word is not in us.” His doctrine, that is, or
word is truth.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p121.2"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p122"></span>[1 John
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#001.md)<span id="vi.iv.ix-p122.1"></span>.
“And if any man sin,” he says, “we have an advocate <span
id="fr_3787"></span>[3788](#fn_3787.md) with the Father, Jesus Christ.” For
so the Lord is an advocate with the Father for us. So also is there, an
advocate, whom, after His assumption, He vouchsafed to send. For these
primitive and first-created virtues are unchangeable as to substance,
and along with subordinate angels and archangels, whose names they
share, effect divine operations. Thus also Moses names the virtue of the
angel Michael, by an angel near to himself and of lowest grade. The like
also we find in the holy prophets; but to Moses an angel appeared near
and at hand. Moses heard him and spoke to him manifestly, face to face.
On the other prophets, through the agency of angels, an impression was
made, as of beings hearing and seeing.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p124"></span>On this account also, they alone heard,
and they alone saw; as also is seen in the case of Samuel. <span
id="fr_3788"></span>[3789](#fn_3788.md) Elisæus also alone heard the voice
by which he was called. <span id="fr_3789"></span>[3790](#fn_3789.md) If
the voice had been open and common, it would have been heard by all. In
this instance it was heard by him alone in whom the impression made by
the angel worked.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p127"></span>[1 John
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#002.md)<span id="vi.iv.ix-p127.1"></span>.
“And not only for our sins,”—that is for those of the faithful,—is the
Lord the propitiator, does he say, “but also for the whole world.” He,
indeed, saves all; but some \[He saves\], converting them by
punishments; others, however, who follow voluntarily \[He saves\] with
dignity of honour; so “that every knee should bow to Him, of things in
heaven, and things on earth, and things under the earth;” <span
id="fr_3790"></span>[3791](#fn_3790.md) that is, angels, men, and souls
that before His advent have departed from this temporal life.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p129"></span>[1 John
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#003.md)<span id="vi.iv.ix-p129.1"></span>.
“And by this we know that we know Him, if we keep His commandments.” For
the Gnostic <span id="fr_3791"></span>[3792](#fn_3791.md) \[he who knows\]
also does the Works which pertain to the province of virtue. But he who
performs the works is not necessarily also a Gnostic. For a man may be a
doer of right works, and yet not a knower of the mysteries of science.
Finally, knowing that some works are performed from fear of punishment,
and some on account of the promise of reward, he shows the perfection of
the man gifted with knowledge, who fulfils his works by love. Further,
he adds, and says:—

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p131"></span>[1 John
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#005.md)<span id="vi.iv.ix-p131.1"></span>.
“But whoso keepeth His word, in him verily is the love of God perfected:
hereby know we that we are in Him,”—by faith and love.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p132"></span>[1 John
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#007.md)<span id="vi.iv.ix-p132.1"></span>.
“I write no new commandment unto you, but an old commandment, which ye
had from the beginning,”—through the Law, that is, and the prophets;
where it is said, God is one. Accordingly, also, he infers, “For the old
commandment is the word which ye have heard.”

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p133"></span>Again, however, he says:—

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p134"></span>[1 John
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#008.md)<span id="vi.iv.ix-p134.1"></span>.
“This is the commandment; for the darkness” of perversion, that is, “has
passed away, and, lo, the true light hath already shone,”—that is,
through faith, through knowledge, through the Covenant working in men,
through prepared judgments.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p135"></span>[1 John
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#009.md)<span id="vi.iv.ix-p135.1"></span>.
“He that saith he is in the light,”—in the light, he means in the
truth,—“and hateth,” he says, “his brother.” By his brother, he means
not only his neighbour, but also the Lord. For unbelievers hate Him and
do not keep His commandments. Therefore also he infers:—

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p136"></span>[1 John
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#010.md)<span
id="vi.iv.ix-p136.1"></span>. “He that loveth his brother abideth in the
light; and there is none occasion of stumbling in him.”

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p137"></span>[1 John
2:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#012.md)<span
id="vi.iv.ix-p137.1"></span>. He then indicates the stages of
advancement and progress of souls that are still located in the flesh;
and calls those whose sins have been forgiven, for the Lord’s name’s
sake, “little children,” for many believe on account of the name only.
He styles “fathers” the perfect, “who have known what was from the
beginning,” and received with understanding,—the Son, that is, of whom
he said above, “that which was from the beginning.”

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p138"></span>“I write,” says he, “to you, young men,
because ye have overcome the wicked one.” Young man strong in despising
pleasures. “The wicked one” points out the eminence of the devil. “The
children,” moreover, know the Father; having fled from idols and
gathered together to the one God.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p139"></span>[1 John
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#015.md)<span
id="vi.iv.ix-p139.1"></span>. “For the world,” he says, “is in the <span
id="page_576">p. 576</span> <span id="vi.iv.ix-Page_576"></span>wicked
one.” Is not the world, and all that is in the world, called God’s
creation and very good? Yes. But,

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p140"></span>[1 John
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#016.md)<span
id="vi.iv.ix-p140.1"></span>. “The lust of the flesh, the lust of the
eyes, and the ambition of the world,” which arise from the perversion of
life, “are not of the Father, but of the world,” and of you.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p141"></span>[1 John
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#017.md)<span
id="vi.iv.ix-p141.1"></span>. “Therefore also the world shall pass away,
and the lust thereof; but he that doeth the will of God” and His
commandments “abideth for ever.”

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p142"></span>[1 John
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#019.md)<span
id="vi.iv.ix-p142.1"></span>. “They went out from us; but they were not
of us”—neither the apostate angels, nor men falling away;—“but that they
may be manifested that they are not of us.” With sufficient clearness he
distinguishes the class of the elect and that of the lost, and that
which remaining in faith “has an unction from the Holy One,” which comes
through faith. He that abideth not in faith.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p143"></span>[1 John
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#022.md)<span
id="vi.iv.ix-p143.1"></span>. “A liar” and “an antichrist, who denieth
that Jesus is the Christ.” For Jesus, Saviour and Redeemer, is also
Christ the King.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p144"></span>[1 John
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#023.md)<span
id="vi.iv.ix-p144.1"></span>. “He who denies the Son,” by ignoring Him,
“has not the Father, nor does he know Him.” But he who knoweth the Son
and the Father, knows according to knowledge, and when the Lord shall be
manifested at His second advent, shall have confidence and not be
confounded. Which confusion is heavy punishment.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p145"></span>[1 John
2:29](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#029.md)<span
id="vi.iv.ix-p145.1"></span>. “Every one,” he says, “who doeth
righteousness is born of God;” being regenerated, that is, according to
faith.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p145.2"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p146"></span>[1 John
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#001.md)<span id="vi.iv.ix-p146.1"></span>.
“For the world knoweth us not, as it knew Him not.” He means by the
world those who live a worldly life in pleasures.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p147"></span>[1 John
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#002.md)<span id="vi.iv.ix-p147.1"></span>.
“Beloved,” says he, “now are we the sons of God,” not by natural
affection, but because we have God as our Father. For it is the greater
love that, seeing we have no relationship to God, He nevertheless loves
us and calls us His sons. “And it hath not yet appeared what we shall
be;” that is, to what kind of glory we shall attain. “For if He shall be
manifested,”—that is, if we are made perfect,—“we shall be like Him,” as
reposing and justified, pure in virtue, “so that we may see Him” (His
countenance) “as He is,” by comprehension.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p148"></span>[1 John
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#008.md)<span id="vi.iv.ix-p148.1"></span>.
“He that doeth unrighteousness is of the devil,” that is, of the devil
as his father, following and choosing the same things. “The devil
sinneth from the beginning,” he says. From the beginning from which he
began to sin, incorrigibly persevering in sinning.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p149"></span>[1 John
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#009.md)<span id="vi.iv.ix-p149.1"></span>.
He says, “Whosoever is born of God does not commit sin, for His seed
remaineth in him;” that is, His word in him who is born again through
faith.

3:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#010.md)<span

likewise the children of the devil,” who choose things like the devil;
for so also they are said to be of the wicked one.

3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#015.md)<span
id="vi.iv.ix-p151.1"></span>. “Every one who hateth his brother is a
murderer.” For in him through unbelief Christ dies. Rightly, therefore,
he continues, “And ye know that no murderer and unbeliever hath eternal
life abiding in him.” For the living Christ <span
id="fr_3792"></span>[3793](#fn_3792.md) abides in the believing soul.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p153"></span>[1 John
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#016.md)<span
id="vi.iv.ix-p153.1"></span>. “For He Himself laid down His life for
us;” that is, for those who believe; that is, for the apostles. If then
He laid down His life for the apostles, he means His apostles
themselves: us if he said, We, I say, the apostles, for whom He laid
down His life, “ought to lay down our lives for the brethren;” for the
salvation of their neighbours was the glory of the apostles.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p154"></span>[1 John
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#020.md)<span
id="vi.iv.ix-p154.1"></span>. He says, “For God is greater than our
heart;” that is, the virtue of God \[is greater\] than conscience, which
will follow the soul. Wherefore he continues, and says, “and knoweth all
things.”

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p159"></span>[1 John
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#008.md)<span id="vi.iv.ix-p159.1"></span>.
“For there are three that bear witness, the spirit,” which is life, “and
the water,” which is regeneration and faith, “and the blood,” which is
knowledge; “and these three are one.” For in the Saviour are those
saving virtues, and life itself exists in His own Son.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p160"></span>[1 John
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#014.md)<span
id="vi.iv.ix-p160.1"></span>. “And this is the confidence which we have
towards Him, that if we ask anything according to His will, He will hear
us.” He does not say absolutely what we shall ask, but what we ought to
ask.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p161"></span>[1 John
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#019.md)<span
id="vi.iv.ix-p161.1"></span>. “And the whole word lieth in the wicked
one;” not the creation, but worldly men, and those who live according to
their lusts.

5:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#020.md)<span

understanding,” which comes to us, that is, by faith, and is also called
the Holy Spirit.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p162.2"></span>

##### <span id="vi.iv.ix-p162.3"></span>IV.—Comments on the Second Epistle of John.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p163"></span>The second Epistle of John, which is
written to Virgins, is very simple. It was written to a Babylonian lady,
by name Electa, and indicates <span id="page_577">p. 577</span> <span
id="vi.iv.ix-Page_577"></span>the election of the holy Church. He
establishes in this Epistle that the following out of the faith is not
without charity, and so that no one divide Jesus Christ; but only to
believe that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh. For he who has the Son
by apprehension in his intellect knows also the Father, and grasps with
his mind intelligibly the greatness of His power working without
beginning of time.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p164"></span>[2 John
10](../../../bib/kjv/jo2001.htm#010.md)<span id="vi.iv.ix-p164.1"></span>.
He says, “If any come unto you and bring not this doctrine, receive him
not into your house, neither bid him God speed; for he that biddeth him
God speed is partaker of his evil deeds.” He forbids us to salute such,
and to receive them to our hospitality. For this is not harsh in the
case of a man of this sort. But he admonishes them neither to confer nor
dispute with such as are not able to handle divine things with
intelligence, lest through them they be seduced from the doctrine of
truth, influenced by plausible reasons. Now, I think that we are not
even to pray with such, because in the prayer which is made at home,
after rising from prayer, the salutation of joy is also the token of
peace.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p164.2"></span>

#### <span id="vi.iv.ix-p164.3"></span>II.—Nicetas <span id="fr_3793"></span>[3794](#fn_3793.md) Bishop of Heraclea.

##### <span id="vi.iv.ix-p165.1"></span>From His Catena.

##### <span id="vi.iv.ix-p165.2"></span>I.—Job i. 21.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p166"></span>But Job’s words may be more elegantly
understood of evil and sin thus: “Naked” was formed from the earth at
the beginning, as if from a “mother’s womb: naked to the earth shall I
also depart;” naked, <span id="fr_3794"></span>[3795](#fn_3794.md) not of
possessions, for that were a trivial and common thing, but of evil and
sin, and of the unsightly shape which follows those who have led bad
lives. Obviously, all of us human beings are born naked, and again are
buried naked, swathed only in grave-clothes. For God hath provided for
us another life, and made the present life the way for the course which
leads to it; appointing the supplies derived from what we possess merely
as provisions for the way; and on our quitting this way, the wealth,
consisting of the things which we possessed, journeys no farther with
us. For not a single thing that we possess is properly our own: of one
possession alone, that is godliness, are we properly owners. Of this,
death, when it overtakes us, will not rob us; but from all else it will
eject us, though against our will. For it is for the support of life
that we all have received what we possess; and after enjoying merely the
use of it, each one departs, obtaining from life a brief remembrance.
For this is the end of all prosperity; this is the conclusion of the
good things of this life. Well, then, does the infant, on opening its
eyes, after issuing from the womb, immediately begin with crying, not
with laughter. For it weeps, as if bewailing life, at whose hands from
the outset it tastes of deadly gifts. For immediately on being born its
hands and feet are swaddled; and swathed in bonds it takes the breast. O
introduction to life, precursor of death! The child has but just entered
on life, and straightway there is put upon it the raiment of the dead:
for nature reminds those that are born of their end. Wherefore also the
child, on being born, wails, as if crying plaintively to its mother.
Why, O mother, didst thou bring me forth to this life, in which
prolongation of life is progress to death? Why hast thou brought me into
this troubled world, in which, on being born, swaddling bands are my
first experience? Why hast thou delivered me to such a life as this, in
which both a pitiable youth wastes away before old age, and old age is
shunned as under the doom of death? Dreadful, O mother, is the course of
life, which has death as the goal of the runner. Bitter is the road of
life we travel, with the grave as the wayfarer’s inn. Perilous the sea
of life we sail; for it has Hades as a pirate to attack us. Man alone is
born in all respects naked, without a weapon or clothing born with him;
not as being inferior to the other animals, but that nakedness and your
bringing nothing with you may produce thought; and that thought may
bring out dexterity, expel sloth, introduce the arts for the supply of
our needs, and beget variety of contrivances. For, naked, man is full of
contrivances, being pricked on by his necessity, as by a goad, how to
escape rains, how to elude cold, how to fence off blows, how to till the
earth, how to terrify wild beasts, how to subdue the more powerful of
them. Wetted with rain, he contrived a roof; having suffered from cold,
he invented clothing; being struck, he constructed a breastplate;
bleeding his hands with the thorns in tilling the ground, he availed
himself of the help of tools; in his naked state liable to become a prey
to wild beasts, he discovered from his fear an art which frightened what
frightened him. Nakedness begat one accomplishment after another; so
that even his nakedness was a gift and a master-favour. Accordingly, Job
also being made naked of wealth, possessions, of the blessing of
children, of a numerous offspring, and having lost everything in a short
time, uttered this grateful exclamation: “Naked came I out of the womb,
naked also shall I depart thither;”—to God, that is, and to that blessed
lot and rest.

an example <span id="page_578">p. 578</span> <span
id="vi.iv.ix-Page_578"></span>of this, the word proposes to us the
blessed Job. For it is said of him, “What man is like Job, who drinketh
up scorning like water?” For truly enviable, and, in my judgment, worthy
of all admiration, a man is, if he has attained to such a degree of
long-suffering as to be able with ease to grapple with the pain, truly
keen, and not easily conquered by everybody, which arises from being
wronged.

Perhaps by the iota and tittle His righteousness cries, “If ye come
right unto Me, I will also come right to you; but if crooked, I also
will come crooked, saith the Lord of hosts;” intimating that the ways of
sinners are intricate and crooked. For the way right and agreeable to
nature which is intimated by the iota of Jesus, is His goodness, which
constantly directs those who believe from hearing. “There shall not,
therefore, pass from the law one iota or one tittle,” neither from the
right and good the mutual promises, nor from the crooked and unjust the
punishment assigned to them. “For the Lord doeth good to the good, but
those who turn aside into crooked ways God will lead with the workers of
iniquity.” <span id="fr_3797"></span>[3798](#fn_3797.md)

and being out of them is “not after the flesh;” so also “after the
flesh” in the case of Christ was His subjection to natural affections,
and His not being subject to them is to be “not after the flesh.” But,
he says, as He was released, so also are we.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p181"></span>Yes, truly, the apostles were baptised,
as Clement the Stromatist relates in the fifth book of the Hypotyposes.
For, in explaining the apostolic statement, “I thank God that I baptised
none of you,” he says, Christ is said to have baptised Peter alone, and
Peter Andrew, and Andrew John, and they James and the rest. <span

##### <span id="vi.iv.ix-p182.1"></span>Eusebius: Ecclesiastical History, Book VI. II. 1.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p183"></span>Now Clement, writing in the sixth book
of the Hypotyposes, makes this statement. For he says that Peter and
James and John, after the Saviour’s ascension, though pre-eminently
honoured by the Lord, did not contend for glory, but made James the
Just, bishop of Jerusalem.

##### <span id="vi.iv.ix-p183.1"></span>Eusebius: Ecclesiastical History, II. 15.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p184"></span>So, then, through the visit of the
divine word to them, the power of Simon was extinguished, and
immediately was destroyed along with the man himself. And such a ray of
godliness shone forth on the minds of Peter’s hearers, that they were
not satisfied with the once hearing or with the unwritten teaching of
the divine proclamation, but with all manner of entreaties importuned
Mark, to whom the Gospel is ascribed, he being the companion of Peter,
that he would leave in writing a record of the teaching which had been
delivered to them verbally; and did not let the man alone till they
prevailed upon him; and so to them we owe the Scripture called the
“Gospel by Mark.” On learning what had been done, through the revelation
of the Spirit, it is said that the apostle was delighted with the
enthusiasm of the men, and sanctioned the composition for reading in the
Churches. Clemens gives the narrative in the sixth book of the
Hypotyposes.

##### <span id="vi.iv.ix-p184.1"></span>Eusebius: Ibid.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p185"></span>Then, also, as the divine Scripture
says, Herod, on the execution of James, seeing that what was done
pleased the Jews, laid hands also on Peter; and having put him in
chains, would have presently put him to death, had not an angel in a
divine vision appeared to him by night, and wondrously releasing him
from his bonds, sent him away to the ministry of preaching.

##### <span id="vi.iv.ix-p185.1"></span>Eusebius: Ecclesiastical History, VI. 14.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p186"></span>And in the Hypotyposes, in a word, he
has made abbreviated narratives of the whole testamentary Scripture; and
has not passed over the disputed books,—I mean Jude and the rest of the
Catholic Epistles and Barnabas, and what is called the Revelation of
Peter. And he says that the Epistle to the Hebrews is Paul’s, and was
written to the Hebrews in the Hebrew language; but that Luke, having
carefully translated it, gave it to the Greeks, and hence the same
colouring in the expression is discoverable in this Epistle and the
Acts; and that the name “Paul an Apostle” was very properly not
prefixed, for, he says, that writing to the Hebrews, who were prejudiced
against him and suspected, he with great wisdom did not repel them in
the beginning by putting down his name.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p196"></span>To James the Just, and John and Peter,
the Lord after His resurrection imparted knowledge (<span

##### <span id="vi.iv.ix-p196.2"></span>Eusebius: the Same, II. 2.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p197"></span>And of this James, Clement also relates
an anecdote worthy of remembrance in the seventh book of the
Hypotyposes, from a tradition of his predecessors. He says that the man
who brought him to trial, on seeing him bear his testimony, was moved,
and confessed that he was a Christian himself. Accordingly, he says,
they were both led away together, and on the way the other asked James
to forgive him. And he, considering a little, said, “Peace be to thee”
and kissed him. And so both were beheaded together.

##### <span id="vi.iv.ix-p197.1"></span>Eusebius: the Same, VI. 14.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p198"></span>And now, as the blessed Presbyter used
to say, since the Lord, as the Apostle of the Almighty, was sent to the
Hebrews, Paul, as having been sent to the Gentiles, did not subscribe
himself apostle of the Hebrews, out of modesty and reverence for the
Lord, and because, being the herald and apostle of the Gentiles, his
writing to the Hebrews was something over and above \[his assigned
function.\]

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p199"></span>Again, in the same books Clement has set
down a tradition which he had received from the elders before him, in
regard to the order of the Gospels, to the following effect. He says
that the Gospels containing the genealogies were written first, and that
the Gospel according to Mark was composed in the following
circumstances:—

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p200"></span>Peter having preached the word publicly
at Rome, and by the Spirit proclaimed the Gospel, those who were
present, who were numerous, entreated Mark, inasmuch as he had attended
him from an early period, and remembered what had been said, to write
down what had been spoken. On his composing the Gospel, he handed it to
those who had made the request to him; which coming to Peter’s
knowledge, he neither hindered nor encouraged. But John, the last of
all, seeing that what was corporeal was set forth in the Gospels, on the
entreaty of his intimate friends, and inspired by the Spirit, composed a
spiritual Gospel.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p201"></span>Being is in God. God is divine being,
eternal and without beginning, incorporeal and illimitable, and the
cause of what exists. Being is that which wholly subsists. Nature is the
truth of things, or the inner reality of them. According to others, it
is the production of what has come to existence; and according to
others, again, it is the providence of God, causing the being, and the
manner of being, in the things which are produced.

##### <span id="vi.iv.ix-p201.1"></span>S. Maximus: in the Same, p. 152.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p202"></span>Willing is a natural power, which
desires what is in accordance with nature. Willing is a natural
appetency, corresponding with the nature of the rational creature.
Willing is a natural spontaneous movement of the self-determining mind,
or the mind voluntarily moved about anything. Spontaneity is the mind
moved naturally, or an intellectual self-determining movement of the
soul.

admits no delay, and does not let the impulse pass on to a long space of
time. For it is in this way that evil will be unable to leave a trace in
us, being plucked away at the moment of its assault like a newly planted
plant.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p211"></span>As the creatures called crabs are easy
to catch, from their going sometimes forward and sometimes backward; so
also the soul, which at one time is laughing, at another weeping, and at
another giving way to luxury, can do no good.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p212"></span>He who is sometimes grieving, and is

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p223"></span>Above all, Christians are not allowed to
correct with violence the delinquencies of sins. For it is not those
that abstain from wickedness from compulsion, but those that abstain
from choice, that God crowns. It is impossible for a man to be steadily
good except by his own choice. For he that is made good by compulsion of
another is not good; for he is not what he is by his own choice. For it
is the freedom of each one that makes true goodness and reveals real
wickedness. Whence through these dispositions God contrived to make His
own disposition manifest.

##### <span id="vi.iv.ix-p223.1"></span>XI.—Fragments Found in Greek Only in the Oxford Edition.

##### <span id="vi.iv.ix-p223.2"></span>From the Last Work on the Passover. (Quoted in the Paschal Chronicle.)

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p224"></span>Accordingly, in the years gone by, Jesus
went to eat the passover sacrificed by the Jews, keeping the feast. But
when he had preached He who was the Passover, the Lamb of God, led as a
sheep to the slaughter, presently taught His disciples the mystery of
the type on the thirteenth day, on which also they inquired, “Where wilt
Thou that we prepare for Thee to eat the passover?” <span
id="fr_3804"></span>[3805](#fn_3804.md) It was on this day, then, that both
the consecration of the unleavened bread and the preparation for the
feast took place. Whence John naturally describes the disciples as
already previously prepared to have their feet washed by the Lord. And
on the following day our Saviour suffered, He who was the Passover,
propitiously sacrificed by the Jews.

##### <span id="vi.iv.ix-p225.2"></span>The Same.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p226"></span>Suitably, therefore, to the fourteenth
day, on which He also suffered, in the morning, the chief priests and
the scribes, who brought Him to Pilate, did not enter the Prætorium,
that they might not be defiled, but might freely eat the passover in the
evening. With this precise determination of the days both the whole
Scriptures agree, and the Gospels harmonize. The resurrection also
attests it. He certainly rose on the third day, which fell on the first
day of the weeks of harvest, on which the law prescribed that the priest
should offer up the sheaf.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p227"></span>1. What choral dance and high festival
is held in heaven, if there is one that has become an exile and a
fugitive from the life led under the Father, knowing not that those who
put themselves <span id="page_582">p. 582</span> <span
id="vi.iv.ix-Page_582"></span>far from Him shall perish; if he has
squandered the gift, and substance, and inheritance of the Father; if
there is one whose faith has failed, and whose hope is spent, by rushing
along with the Gentiles into the same profligacy of debauchery; and
then, famished and destitute, and not even filled with what the swine
eat, has arisen and come to his Father!

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p228"></span>But the kind Father waits not till the
son comes to Him. For perchance he would never be able or venture to
approach, did he not find Him gracious. Wherefore, when he merely
wishing, when he straightway made a beginning, when he took the first
step, while he was yet a great way off, He \[the Father\] was moved with
compassion, and ran, and fell upon his neck and kissed him. And then the
son, taking courage, confessed what he had done.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p229"></span>Wherefore the Father bestows on him the
glory and honour that was due and meet, putting on him the best robe,
the robe of immortality; and a ring, a royal signet and divine
seal,—impress of consecration, signature of glory, pledge of testimony
(for it is said, “He hath set to his seal that God is true,”) <span
id="fr_3805"></span>[3806](#fn_3805.md) and shoes, not those perishable
ones which he hath set his foot on holy ground is bidden take off, nor
such as he who is sent to preach the kingdom of heaven is forbidden to
put on, but such as wear not, and are suited for the journey to heaven,
becoming and adorning the heavenly path, such as unwashed feet never put
on, but those which are washed by our Teacher and Lord.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p231"></span>Many, truly, are the shoes of the sinful
soul, by which it is bound and cramped. For each man is cramped by the
cords of his own sins. Accordingly, Abraham swears to the king of Sodom,
“I will not take of all that is thine, from a thread to a
shoe-latchet.” <span id="fr_3806"></span>[3807](#fn_3806.md) On account of
these being defiled and polluted on the earth, every kind of wrong and
selfishness engrosses life. As the Lord reproves Israel by Amos, saying,
“For three iniquities of Israel, yea, for four, I will not turn him
back; because they have given away the righteous for silver, and the
needy for a pair of shoes, which tread upon the dust of the
ground.” <span id="fr_3807"></span>[3808](#fn_3807.md)

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p234"></span>2. Now the shoes which the Father bids
the servant give to the repentant son who has betaken himself to Him, do
not impede or drag to the earth (for the earthly tabernacle weighs down
the anxious mind); but they are buoyant, and ascending, and waft to
heaven, and serve as such a ladder and chariot as he requires who has
turned his mind towards the Father. For, beautiful after being first
beautifully adorned with all these things without, he enters into the
gladness within. For “Bring out” was said by Him who had first said,
“While he was yet a great way off, he ran and fell upon his neck.” For
it is here <span id="fr_3808"></span>[3809](#fn_3808.md) that all the
preparation for entrance to the marriage to which we are invited must be
accomplished. He, then, who has been made ready to enter will say, “This
my joy is fulfilled.” <span id="fr_3809"></span>[3810](#fn_3809.md) But the
unlovely and unsightly man will hear, “Friend, how camest thou in here,
without having a wedding garment?” <span
id="fr_3810"></span>[3811](#fn_3810.md) And the fat and unctuous food,—the
delicacies abundant and sufficing of the blessed,—the fatted calf is
killed; which is also again spoken of as a lamb (not literally); that no
one may suppose it small; but it is the great and greatest. For not
small is “the Lamb of God who taketh away the sin of the world,” <span
id="fr_3811"></span>[3812](#fn_3811.md) who “was led as a sheep to the
slaughter,” the sacrifice full of marrow, all whose fat, according to
the sacred law, was the Lord’s. For He was wholly devoted and
consecrated to the Lord; so well grown, and to such excessive size, as
to reach and extend over all, and to fill those who eat Him and feed
upon Him. For He is both flesh and bread, and has given Himself as both
to us to be eaten.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p239"></span>To the sons, then, who come to Him, the
Father gives the calf, and it is slain and eaten. But those who do not
come to Him He pursues and disinherits, and is found to be a most
powerful bull. Here, by reason of His size and prowess, it is said of
Him, “His glory is as that of an unicorn.” <span
id="fr_3812"></span>[3813](#fn_3812.md) And the prophet Habakkuk sees Him
bearing horns, and celebrates His defensive attitude—“horns in His
hands.” <span id="fr_3813"></span>[3814](#fn_3813.md) Wherefore the sign
shows His power and authority,—horns that pierce on both sides, or
rather, on all sides, and through everything. And those who eat are so
strengthened, and retain such strength from the life-giving food in
them, that they themselves are stronger than their enemies, and are all
but armed with the horns of a bull; as it is said, “In thee shall we
butt our enemies.” <span id="fr_3814"></span>[3815](#fn_3814.md)

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p243"></span>3. Gladness there is, and music, and
dances; although the elder son, who had ever been with and ever obedient
to the Father, takes it ill, when he who never had himself been
dissipated or profligate sees the guilty one made happy.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p244"></span>Accordingly the Father calls him,
saying, “Son, thou art ever with me.” And what greater joy and feast and
festivity can be than being continually with God, standing by His side
and serving Him? “And all that is mine is thine.” And blessed is the
heir of God, for whom the <span id="page_583">p. 583</span> <span
id="vi.iv.ix-Page_583"></span>Father holds possession,—the faithful, to
whom the whole world of possessions belongs.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p245"></span>“It was meet that we should be glad, and
rejoice; for thy brother was dead, and is alive again.” Kind Father, who
givest all things life, and raisest the dead. “And was lost, and is
found.” And “blessed is the man whom Thou hast chosen and
accepted,” <span id="fr_3815"></span>[3816](#fn_3815.md) and whom having
sought, Thou dost find. “Blessed are those whose iniquities are
forgiven, whose sins are covered.” <span
id="fr_3816"></span>[3817](#fn_3816.md) It is for man to repent of sins;
but let this be accompanied with a change that will not be checked. For
he who does not act so shall be put to shame, because he has acted not
with his whole heart, but in haste.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p248"></span>And it is ours to flee to God. And let
us endeavour after this ceaselessly and energetically. For He says,
“Come unto Me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give
you rest.” <span id="fr_3817"></span>[3818](#fn_3817.md) And prayer and
confession with humility are voluntary acts. Wherefore it is enjoined,
“First tell thy sins, that thou mayest be justified.” <span
id="fr_3818"></span>[3819](#fn_3818.md) What afterwards we shall obtain,
and what we shall be, it is not for us to judge.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p251"></span>4. Such is the strict meaning of the
parable. <span id="fr_3819"></span>[3820](#fn_3819.md) The repentant son
came to the pitying Father, never hoping for these things,—the best
robe, and the ring, and the shoes,—or to taste the fatted calf, or to
share in gladness, or enjoy music and dances; but he would have been
contented with obtaining what in his own estimation he deemed himself
worth. “Make me,” he had made up his mind to say, “as one of thy hired
servants.” But when he saw the Father’s welcome meeting him, he did not
say this, but said what he had in his mind to say first, “Father, I have
sinned against Heaven, and before thee.” And so both his humility and
his accusation became the cause of justification and glory. For the
righteous man condemns himself in his first words. So also the publican
departed justified rather than the Pharisee. The son, then, knew not
either what he was to obtain, or how to take or use or put on himself
the things given him; since he did not take the robe himself, and put it
on. But it is said, “Put it on him.” He did not himself put the ring on
his finger, but those who were bidden “Put a ring on his hand.” Nor did
he put the shoes on himself, but it was they who heard, “and shoes on
his feet.”

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p253"></span>And these things were perhaps incredible
to him and to others, and unexpected before they took place; but gladly
received and praised were the gifts with which he was presented.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p254"></span>5. The parable exhibits this thought,
that the exercise of the faculty of reason has been accorded to each
man. Wherefore the prodigal is introduced, demanding from his father his
portion, that is, of the state of mind, endowed by reason. For the
possession of reason is granted to all, in order to the pursuit of what
is good, and the avoidance of what is bad. But many who are furnished by
God with this make a bad use of the knowledge that has been given them,
and land in the profligacy of evil practices, and wickedly waste the
substance of reason,—the eye on disgraceful sights, the tongue on
blasphemous words, the smell on fœtid licentious excesses of pleasures,
the mouth on swinish gluttony, the hands on thefts, the feet on running
into plots, the thoughts on impious counsels, the inclinations on
indulgence on the love of ease, the mind on brutish pastime. They
preserve nothing of the substance of reason unsquandered. Such an one,
therefore, Christ represents in the parable,—as a rational creature,
with his reason darkened, and asking from the Divine Being what is
suitable to reason; then as obtaining from God, and making a wicked use
of what had been given, and especially of the benefits of baptism, which
had been vouchsafed to him; whence also He calls him a prodigal; and
then, after the dissipation of what had been given him, and again his
restoration by repentance, \[He represents\] the love of God shown to
him.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p255"></span>6. For He says, “Bring hither the fatted
calf, kill it, and let us eat and be merry; for this my son”—a name of
nearest relationship, and significative of what is given to the
faithful—“was dead and lost,”—an expression of extremest alienation; for
what is more alien to the living than the lost and dead? For neither can
be possessed any more. But having from the nearest relationship fallen
to extremest alienation, again by repentance he returned to near
relationship. For it is said, “Put on him the best robe,” which was his
the moment he obtained baptism. I mean the glory of baptism, the
remission of sins, and the communication of the other blessings, which
he obtained immediately he had touched the font.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p256"></span>“And put a ring on his hand.” Here is
the mystery of the Trinity; which is the seal impressed on those who
believe.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p257"></span>“And put shoes on his feet,” for “the
preparation of the Gospel of peace,” <span
id="fr_3820"></span>[3821](#fn_3820.md) and the whole course that leads to
good actions.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p259"></span>7. But whom Christ finds lost, after sin
committed since baptism, those Novatus, enemy of God, resigns to
destruction. Do not let us then reckon any fault if we repent; guarding
against falling, let us, if we have fallen, retrace our steps. And while
dreading to offend, let us, after offending, <span id="page_584">p.
584</span> <span id="vi.iv.ix-Page_584"></span>avoid despair, and be
eager to be confirmed; and on sinking, let us haste to rise up again.
Let us obey the Lord, who calls to us, “Come unto Me, all ye that
labour, and I will give you rest.” <span
id="fr_3821"></span>[3822](#fn_3821.md) Let us employ the gift of reason
for actions of prudence. Let us learn now abstinence from what is
wicked, that we may not be forced to learn in the future. Let us employ
life as a training school for what is good; and let us be roused to the
hatred of sin. Let us bear about a deep love for the Creator; let us
cleave to Him with our whole heart; let us not wickedly waste the
substance of reason, like the prodigal. Let us obtain the joy laid up,
in which Paul exulting, exclaimed, “Who shall separate us from the love
of Christ?” <span id="fr_3822"></span>[3823](#fn_3822.md) To Him belongs
glory and honour, with the Father and the Holy Spirit, world without
end. Amen.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p262"></span>Therefore God does not here take the
semblance of man, but of a dove, because He wished to show the
simplicity and gentleness of the new manifestation of the Spirit by the
likeness of the dove. For the law was stern, and punished with the
sword; but grace is joyous, and trains by the word of meekness. Hence
the Lord also says to the apostles, who said that He should punish with
fire those who would not receive Him, after the manner of Elias: “Ye
know not what manner of spirit ye are of.” <span

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p264"></span>Possibly by the “iota and the tittle”
His righteousness exclaims, “If ye come right to me, I also will come
right to you; if ye walk crooked, I also will walk crooked, saith the
Lord of hosts,” <span id="fr_3824"></span>[3825](#fn_3824.md) alluding to
the offences of sinners under the name of crooked ways. For the straight
way, and that according to nature, which is pointed out by the iota of
Jesus, is His goodness, which is immoveable towards those who have
obediently believed. There shall not then pass away from the law neither
the iota nor the tittle; that is, neither the promise that applies to
the straight in the way, nor the punishment threatened against those
that diverge. For the Lord is good to the straight in the way; but
“those that turn aside after their crooked ways He shall lead forth with
those that work iniquity.” <span id="fr_3825"></span>[3826](#fn_3825.md)
“And with the innocent He is innocent, and with the froward He is
froward;” <span id="fr_3826"></span>[3827](#fn_3826.md) and to the crooked
He sends crooked ways.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p268"></span>His own luminous image God impressed as
with a seal, even the greatest,—on man made in His likeness, that he
might be ruler and lord over all things, and that all things might serve
him. Wherefore God judges man to be wholly His, and His own image. He is
invisible; but His image, man, is visible. Whatever one, then, does to
man, whether good or bad, is referred to Himself. Wherefore from Him
judgment shall proceed, appointing to all according to desert; for He
will avenge His own image.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p272"></span>Solomon the son of David, in the books

resolved to make His shrine, and for the church that was to rise up

and His abode with men is effected by the conjunction and harmony which
obtains among the righteous, and which build and rear a new temple. For
the righteous are the earth, being still encompassed with the earth; and

blessed Peter hesitates not to say, “Ye also, as living stones, are

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p278"></span>What is God? “God,” as the Lord saith,
“is a Spirit.” Now spirit is properly substance, incorporeal, and
uncircumscribed. And that is incorporeal which does not consist of a
body, or whose existence is not according to breadth, length, and depth.
And that is uncircumscribed <span id="fr_3831"></span>[3832](#fn_3831.md)
which has no place, which is wholly in all, and in each entire, and the
same in itself.

substance capable of increase, as a plant grows and decays. The third is
animated and sentient substance, as animal, horse. The fourth is
animate, sentient, rational substance, as man. Wherefore each one of us
is made as consisting of all, having an immaterial soul and a mind,
which is the image of God.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p290"></span>And so far, he says, no one any longer
lives after the flesh. For that is not life, but death. For Christ also,
that He might show this, <span id="fr_3833"></span>[3834](#fn_3833.md)
ceased to live after the flesh. How? Not by putting off the body! Far be
it! For with it as His own He shall come, the Judge of all. But by
divesting Himself of physical affections, such as hunger, and thirst,
and sleep, and weariness. For now He has a body incapable of suffering
and of injury.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p292"></span>As “after the flesh” in our case is
being in the midst of sins, and being out of them is to be “not after
the flesh;” so also after the flesh, in the case of Christ, was His
subjection to natural affections, and not to be subject to them was not
to be “after the flesh.” “But,” he says, “as He was released, so also
are we.” <span id="fr_3834"></span>[3835](#fn_3834.md) Let there be no
longer, he says, subjection to the influences of the flesh. Thus

ought to love me.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p2"></span> \[M. Aurelius Cassiodorus (whose name is
also Senator) was an author and public man of the sixth century, and a
very voluminous writer. He would shine with a greater lustre were he not
so nearly lost in the brighter light of Boëthius, his illustrious
contemporary. After the death of his patron, Theodoric, he continued for
a time in the public service, and in high positions, but, at seventy
years of age, began another career, and for twenty years devoted himself
to letters and the practice of piety in a monastery which he established
in the Neopolitan kingdom, near his native Squillace. Died about <span
class="sc"><span id="vi.iv.ix-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> 560.\]

<span id="fn_3712"></span>[571:3713](0020441.htm#fr_3712.md) <span
id="vi.iv.ix-p2.4"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p3"></span> Comments, i.e., *Adumbrationes*.
Cassiodorus says that he had in his translation corrected what he
considered erroneous in the original. So Fell states: and he is also
inclined to believe that these fragments are from Clement’s lost work,
the <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.ix-p3.1"></span>Ὑποτυπώσεις</span>, of which he believes *The
Adumbrationes* of Cassiodorus to be a translation.

<span id="fn_3713"></span>[571:3714](0020441.htm#fr_3713.md) <span
id="vi.iv.ix-p5.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p6"></span> “Utramque” is the reading, which is
plainly corrupt. We have conjectured “animam.” The rest of the sentence
is so ungrammatical and impracticable as it stands, that it is only by
taking considerable liberties with it that it is translateable at all.

<span id="fn_3714"></span>[571:3715](0020441.htm#fr_3714.md) <span
id="vi.iv.ix-p6.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p7"></span> The text here has *like a drag-net or
(sicut sagena vel)*, which we have omitted, being utterly incapable of
divining any conceivable resemblance or analogy which a drag-net can
afford for the re-union of the soul and body. “Sagena” is either a
blunder for something else which we cannot conjecture, or the sentence
is here, as elsewhere, mutilated. But it is possible that it may have
been the union of the blessed to each other, and their conjunction with
one another according to their affinities, which was the point handled
in the original sentences, of which we have only these obscure and
confusing remains. \[A very good conjecture, on the strength of which
the text might have been let as it stood.\]

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p10"></span> “Cœli,” plainly a mistake for “cœlo” or
“cœlis.” There is apparently a *hiatus* here. “The angelic abode,
guarded in heaven,” most probably is the explanation of “an inheritance
incorruptible and undefiled, reserved in heaven.”

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p279"></span> With an exclamation of surprise at the
Latin translator giving a translation which is utterly unintelligible,
Capperonn amends the text, substituting <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.ix-p279.1"></span>οὗ τόπος οὐδεὶς τῷ</span>, etc., for <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.iv.ix-p279.2"></span>οᾪ τόπος οᾪδεὶς τόπος
τό</span>, etc., and translates accordingly. The emendation is adopted,
with the exception of the <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.ix-p279.3"></span>τῷ</span>, instead of which <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.iv.ix-p279.4"></span>τό</span> is retained.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p285"></span> See *Stromata*, book v. chap. vi. p.
452, which is plainly the source from which this extract is taken.

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p291"></span> We omit <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.ix-p291.1"></span>ὅτι</span>, which the text has after <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.iv.ix-p291.2"></span>δείξῃ</span>, which
seems to indicate the omission of a clause, but as it stands is
superfluous. The Latin translator retains it; and according to the
rendering, the translation would be, “showed that He ceased.”

<span id="vi.iv.ix-p293"></span> This extract, down to “are we,” has
already been given among the extracts from the *Hypotyposes*, p. 578.
