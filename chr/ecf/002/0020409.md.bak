### <span id="vi.iv.vi.xix-p0.2"></span>Elucidations.

##### <span id="vi.iv.vi.xix-p0.3"></span>I.

<span id="vi.iv.vi.xix-p1"></span>(Gentlemen of the Jury, cap. ii. p.
485.)

<span id="vi.iv.vi.xix-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="vi.iv.vi.xix-p2.1"></span>This</span> strange rendering of <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.iv.vi.xix-p2.2"></span>ὦ ἄνδρες
δικασταὶ</span> (which we were taught to translate *O judices*, in our
school-days) occurs three times on this page, and I felt bound to retain
it. But why import such an anachronism into the author’s work, and the
forensic eloquence of the Athenians? Better do violence to idiom, like
our English Bible (“men and brethren”), and say, *O men and judges*. Why
not *judges*? See Sharon Turner (*Anglo-Saxons,* i. p. 476) and Freeman
(*Norman Conquest*, v. p. 451).

##### <span id="vi.iv.vi.xix-p2.3"></span>II.

<span id="vi.iv.vi.xix-p3"></span>(Aristobulus, cap. iii. p. 487, note
7.)

<span id="vi.iv.vi.xix-p4"></span>In addition to the note *in loc*., it
may be well to mention the *Stromata* (book i. cap. xv. p. 316), as
another place where this name occurs. The learned Calmet (Works, tom.
ix. p. 121), in his *Dict. Critic.*, has a valuable statement as to the
difficulties connected with this name and the probability that there
were two so called, who have been confused in the citations and
references of authors.

##### <span id="vi.iv.vi.xix-p4.1"></span>III.

<span id="vi.iv.vi.xix-p5"></span>(Egyptians, cap. iv. p. 488.)

<span id="vi.iv.vi.xix-p6"></span>The paradoxical genius of Warburton
ought not to dissuade us from enjoying the amusement and instruction to
be found in his *Divine Legation*. In many respects he reminds me of
this great Alexandrian Father, and they are worthy of being studied
together. Let me instance, in connection with this subject, the second
book, e. g. p. 151, on *Metempsychosis* (Hurd’s Edition, vol. ii. 1811).

<span id="page_521">p. 521</span> <span
id="vi.iv.vi.xix-Page_521"></span>

##### <span id="vi.iv.vi.xix-p6.1"></span>IV.

<span id="vi.iv.vi.xix-p7"></span>(Egyptian Women, book vi. cap. iv. p.
488.)

<span id="vi.iv.vi.xix-p8"></span>“*Last*, about women,” says our
author; and one would infer *least.* But Rawlinson (*Herod*., vol. ii.
p. 47, ed. New York) has a long and learned note on this subject.
“Queens made offerings with the kings, and the monuments show that an
order of women were employed in the service of the gods.” … Then he
says, “A sort of monastic institution seems to have originated in Egypt
at an early time, and to have been imitated afterwards, when *the real
conventual system* was set on foot by the Christians, in the same
country.” This may be worthy of being borne in mind, when we come to the
cœnobitic life of the Thebaid, which lies, indeed, beyond the limits of
our ante-Nicene researches. But persecution had already driven
Christians to the desert; and the ascetic type of piety, with which the
age and its necessities imprinted the souls of many devout women, may
have led them at a very early period to the “imitation” of which
Rawlinson speaks. The “widows” recognised by the ante-Nicene canons,
would naturally become the founders of “widows’ houses,” such as are to
be seen among the pious Moravians in our times. (See Bunsen, *Hippol.*,
iii. p. 81.)

##### <span id="vi.iv.vi.xix-p8.1"></span>V.

<span id="vi.iv.vi.xix-p9"></span>(Philosophy, cap. vii. p. 493.)

<span id="vi.iv.vi.xix-p10"></span>In justice to Clement’s eulogies of
philosophy, we must constantly bear in mind his reiterated definitions.
We have here a very important outline of his *Christian Eclecticism*,
which, so far from clashing with St. Paul’s scornful references to
Gentile wisdom, seems to me in absolute correspondence with his
reference to “science *falsely so called*” ([1 Tim. vi.
20](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#020.md)<span
id="vi.iv.vi.xix-p10.1"></span>). So, when the apostle identifies
philosophy with “the rudiments of the world,” he adds, “and not after
Christ.” Now, Clement’s eclectic system yokes all true philosophy to the
chariot-wheels of the Messiah, as in this instance; making all true
science hinge upon “the knowledge of the Son of God.” How these chapters
shine in contrast even with Plato.

##### <span id="vi.iv.vi.xix-p10.2"></span>VI.

<span id="vi.iv.vi.xix-p11"></span>(Numbers, cap. xi. p. 499.)

<span id="vi.iv.vi.xix-p12"></span>The marvellous system of numbers
which runs through all revelation, and which gives us the name *Palmoni*
(English margin) in a remarkable passage of [Dan. viii.
13](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#013.md)<span
id="vi.iv.vi.xix-p12.1"></span>, has lately excited fresh interest among
the learned in England and America. Doubtless the language of St. John
([Rev. xiii. 18](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#018.md)<span
id="vi.iv.vi.xix-p12.2"></span>), “Here is wisdom,” etc., influenced the
early Church in what seems to us purely fanciful conjectures and
combinations like these. Two unpretending little books have lately
struck me as quite in the spirit of the Ante-Nicene Fathers: *The Number
Counted*, and the *Name Counted*, by J. A. Upjohn (Appleton, Wis.,
1883).

##### <span id="vi.iv.vi.xix-p12.3"></span>VII.

<span id="vi.iv.vi.xix-p13"></span>(The Gnostic, cap. xi. p. 501.)

<span id="vi.iv.vi.xix-p14"></span>The Gnostic “conjectures things
future,” i.e., by the Scriptures. “He shall show you things to come,”
said the Divine Master, speaking of the Blessed Comforter. To what
extent did these ancients, in their esoteric conjectures, anticipate the
conversion of the empire, and the evils that were to follow? This they
could not publish; but the inquiry deserves thought, and there are dues
for inquirers.

<span id="page_522">p. 522</span> <span
id="vi.iv.vi.xix-Page_522"></span>

##### <span id="vi.iv.vi.xix-p14.1"></span>VIII.

<span id="vi.iv.vi.xix-p15"></span>(Ultimate Issues, cap. xiii. p. 504.)

<span id="vi.iv.vi.xix-p16"></span>With reference to the choice of Judas
to be an apostle, and like mysteries, this seems to me a bit of calm
philosophy, worthy of the childlike faith of the early Christians. I
confess great obligations to a neglected American author, with reference
to such discussions (see Bledsoe, *Theodicy*, New York, 1854).

##### <span id="vi.iv.vi.xix-p16.1"></span>IX.

<span id="vi.iv.vi.xix-p17"></span>(Enigmas, cap. xv. p. 510.)

<span id="vi.iv.vi.xix-p18"></span>We are often troubled by this
Oriental tendency to teach by myth and mysteries; but the text here
quoted from the Proverbs, goes far to show that it is rooted in human
nature, and that God himself has condescended to adopt it. Like every
gift of God, it is subject to almost inevitable corruption and abuse.

##### <span id="vi.iv.vi.xix-p18.1"></span>X.

<span id="vi.iv.vi.xix-p19"></span>(Omissions, cap. xvi. p. 515.)

<span id="vi.iv.vi.xix-p20"></span>The omissions in Clement’s Decalogue
are worthy of remark, and I can only account for them by supposing a
defective text. Kaye might have said more on the subject; but he
suggests this as the solution of the difficulty, when he says (p. 201),
“*As the text now stands*, Clement interprets only eight out of the
ten.”

<span id="vi.iv.vi.xix-p21"></span>P.S.—I have foreborne to say anything
on “the descent into hell,” in my annotations (on cap. vi.), for obvious
reasons of propriety; but, for an entire system of references to the
whole subject, I name Ezra Abbot’s *Catalogue*, appended to Alger’s
*History*, etc. (Philadelphia, 1864.)
