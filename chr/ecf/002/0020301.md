##### <span id="vi.iv.i.viii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VIII.—The Sophistical Arts Useless.

<span id="vi.iv.i.viii-p1"></span>But the art of sophistry, which the
Greeks cultivated, is a fantastic power, which makes false opinions like
true by means of words. For it produces rhetoric in order to persuasion,
and disputation for wrangling. These arts, therefore, if not conjoined
with philosophy, will be injurious to every one. For Plato openly called
sophistry “an evil art.” And Aristotle, following him, demonstrates it
to be a dishonest art, which abstracts in a specious manner the whole
business of wisdom, and professes a wisdom which it has not studied. To
speak briefly, as the beginning of rhetoric is the probable, and an
attempted proof <span id="fr_1883"></span>[1884](#fn_1883) the process,
and the end persuasion, so the beginning of disputation is what is
matter of opinion, and the process a contest, and the end victory. For
in the same manner, also, the beginning of sophistry is the apparent,
and the process twofold; one of rhetoric, continuous and exhaustive; and
the other of logic, and is interrogatory. And its end is admiration.
<span id="page_309">p. 309</span> <span
id="vi.iv.i.viii-Page_309"></span>The dialectic in vogue in the schools,
on the other hand, is the exercise of a philosopher in matters of
opinion, for the sake of the faculty of disputation. But truth is not in
these at all. With reason, therefore, the noble apostle, depreciating
these superfluous arts occupied about words, says, “If any man do not
give heed to wholesome words, but is puffed up by a kind of teaching,
knowing nothing, but doting (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.i.viii-p2.2"></span>νοσῶν</span>) about questions and strifes
of words, whereof cometh contention, envy, railings, evil surmisings,
perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, destitute of the
truth.” <span id="fr_1884"></span>[1885](#fn_1884)

<span id="vi.iv.i.viii-p4"></span>You see how he is moved against them,
calling their art of logic—on which, those to whom this garrulous
mischievous art is dear, whether Greeks or barbarians, plume
themselves—a disease (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.i.viii-p4.1"></span>νοσος</span>). Very beautifully,
therefore, the tragic poet Euripides says in the *Phœnissæ*,—

> <span id="vi.iv.i.viii-p4.2"></span> “But a wrongful speech  
> Is diseased in itself, and needs skilful medicines.” <span
> id="fr_1885"></span>[1886](#fn_1885)  

<span id="vi.iv.i.viii-p6"></span>For the saving Word <span
id="fr_1886"></span>[1887](#fn_1886) is called “wholesome,” He being the
truth; and what is wholesome (healthful) remains ever deathless. But
separation from what is healthful and divine is impiety, and a deadly
malady. These are rapacious wolves hid in sheep-skins, men-stealers, and
glozing soul-seducers, secretly, but proved to be robbers; striving by
fraud and force to catch us who are unsophisticated and have less power
of speech.

> <span id="vi.iv.i.viii-p7.1"></span> “Often a man, impeded through
> want of words, carries less weight  
> In expressing what is right, than the man of eloquence.  
> But now in fluent mouths the weightiest truths  
> They disguise, so that they do not seem what they ought to seem,”  

<span id="vi.iv.i.viii-p8"></span>says the tragedy. Such are these
wranglers, whether they follow the sects, or practice miserable
dialectic arts. These are they that “stretch the warp and weave
nothing,” says the Scripture; <span id="fr_1887"></span>[1888](#fn_1887)
prosecuting a bootless task, which the apostle has called “cunning
craftiness of men whereby they lie in wait to deceive.” <span
id="fr_1888"></span>[1889](#fn_1888) “For there are,” he says, “many
unruly and vain talkers and deceivers.” <span
id="fr_1889"></span>[1890](#fn_1889) Wherefore it was not said to all,
“Ye are the salt of the earth.” <span
id="fr_1890"></span>[1891](#fn_1890) For there are some even of the
hearers of the word who are like the fishes of the sea, which, reared
from their birth in brine, yet need salt to dress them for food.
Accordingly I wholly approve of the tragedy, when it says:—

> <span id="vi.iv.i.viii-p12.2"></span> “O son, false words can be well
> spoken,  
> And truth may be vanquished by beauty of words.  
> But this is not what is most correct, but nature and what is right;  
> He who practices eloquence is indeed wise,  
> But I consider deeds always better than words.”  

<span id="vi.iv.i.viii-p13"></span>We must not, then, aspire to please
the multitude. For we do not practice what will please them, but what we
know is remote from their disposition. “Let us not be desirous of
vainglory,” says the apostle, “provoking one another, envying one
another.” <span id="fr_1891"></span>[1892](#fn_1891)

<span id="vi.iv.i.viii-p15"></span>Thus the truth-loving Plato says, as
if divinely inspired, “Since I am such as to obey nothing but the word,
which, after reflection, appears to me the best.” <span
id="fr_1892"></span>[1893](#fn_1892)

<span id="vi.iv.i.viii-p17"></span>Accordingly he charges those who
credit opinions without intelligence and knowledge, with abandoning
right and sound reason unwarrantably, and believing him who is a partner
in falsehood. For to cheat one’s self of the truth is bad; but to speak
the truth, and to hold as our opinions positive realities, is good.

<span id="vi.iv.i.viii-p18"></span>Men are deprived of what is good
unwillingly. Nevertheless they are deprived either by being deceived or
beguiled, or by being compelled and not believing. He who believes not,
has already made himself a willing captive; and he who changes his
persuasion is cozened, while he forgets that time imperceptibly takes
away some things, and reason others. And after an opinion has been
entertained, pain and anguish, and on the other hand contentiousness and
anger, compel. Above all, men are beguiled who are either bewitched by
pleasure or terrified by fear. And all these are voluntary changes, but
by none of these will knowledge ever be attained.
