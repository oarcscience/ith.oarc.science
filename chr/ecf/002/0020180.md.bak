##### <span id="v.ii.x-p0.1"></span>Chapter X.—The Christians Worship the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.

<span id="v.ii.x-p1"></span>That we are not atheists, therefore, seeing
that we acknowledge one God, uncreated, eternal, invisible, impassible,
incomprehensible, illimitable, who is apprehended by the understanding
only and the reason, who is encompassed by light, and beauty, and
spirit, and power ineffable, by whom the universe has been created
through His Logos, and set in order, and is kept in being—I have
sufficiently demonstrated. \[I say “His Logos”\], for we acknowledge
also a Son of God. Nor let any one think it ridiculous that God should
have a Son. For though the poets, in their fictions, represent the gods
as no better than men, our mode of thinking is not the same as theirs,
concerning either God the Father or the Son. But the Son of God is the
Logos of the Father, in idea and in operation; for after the pattern of
Him and by Him <span id="fr_726"></span>[727](#fn_726.md) were all things
made, the Father and the Son being one. And, the Son being in the Father
and the Father in the Son, in oneness and power of spirit, the
understanding and reason (<span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.x-p2.1"></span>νοῦς καὶ λόγος</span>) of the Father is the Son
of God. But if, in your surpassing intelligence, <span
id="fr_727"></span>[728](#fn_727.md) it occurs to you to inquire what is
meant by the Son, I will state briefly that He is the first product of
the Father, not as having been brought into existence (for from the
beginning, God, who is the eternal mind \[<span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.x-p3.1"></span>νοῦς</span>\], had the Logos in Himself, being
from eternity instinct with Logos \[<span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.x-p3.2"></span>λογικός</span>\]); but inasmuch as He came forth
to be the idea and energizing power of all material things, which lay
like a nature without attributes, and an inactive earth, the grosser
particles being mixed up with the lighter. The prophetic Spirit also
agrees with our statements. “The Lord,” it says, “made me, the beginning
of His ways to His works.” <span id="fr_728"></span>[729](#fn_728.md) The
Holy Spirit Himself also, which operates in the prophets, we assert to
be an effluence of God, flowing from Him, and returning back again like
a beam of the sun. Who, then, would not be astonished to hear men who
speak of God the Father, and of God the Son, and of the Holy
Spirit, <span id="fr_729"></span>[730](#fn_729.md) and who declare both
their power in union and their distinction in order, called atheists?
Nor is our teaching in what relates to the divine nature confined to
these points; but we recognise also a multitude of angels and
ministers, <span id="fr_730"></span>[731](#fn_730.md) whom God the Maker
and Framer of the world distributed and appointed <span id="page_134">p.
134</span> <span id="v.ii.x-Page_134"></span>to their several posts by
His Logos, to occupy themselves about the elements, and the heavens, and
the world, and the things in it, and the goodly ordering of them all.
