##### <span id="vi.iv.i.xix-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIX.—That the Philosophers Have Attained to Some Portion of Truth.

<span id="vi.iv.i.xix-p1"></span>Since, then, the Greeks are testified
to have laid down some true opinions, we may from this point take a
glance at the testimonies. Paul, in the Acts of the Apostles, is
recorded to have said to the Areopagites, “I perceive that ye are more
than ordinarily religious. For as I passed by, and beheld your
devotions, I found an altar with the inscription, To The Unknown God.
Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, Him declare I unto you. God, that
made the world and all things therein, seeing that He is Lord of heaven
and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands; neither is
worshipped with men’s hands, as though He needed anything, seeing He
giveth to all life, and breath, and all things; and hath made of one
blood all nations of men to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath
determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their
habitation; that they should seek God, if haply they might feel after
Him, and find Him; though He be not far from every one of us: for in Him
we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets
have said, For we also are His offspring.” <span
id="fr_2003"></span>[2004](#fn_2003.md) Whence it is evident that the
apostle, by availing himself of poetical examples from the *Phenomena*
of Aratus, approves of what had been well spoken by the Greeks; and
intimates that, by the unknown God, God the Creator was in a roundabout
way worshipped by the Greeks; but that it was necessary by positive
knowledge to apprehend and learn Him by the Son. “Wherefore, then, I
send thee to the Gentiles,” it is said, “to open their eyes, and to turn
them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God; that
they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them that
are sanctified by faith which is in Me.” <span
id="fr_2004"></span>[2005](#fn_2004.md) Such, then, are the eyes of the
blind which are opened. The knowledge of the Father by the Son is the
comprehension of the “Greek circumlocution;” <span
id="fr_2005"></span>[2006](#fn_2005.md) and to turn from the power of Satan
is to change from sin, through which bondage was produced. We do not,
indeed, receive absolutely all philosophy, but that of which
Socrates <span id="fr_2006"></span>[2007](#fn_2006.md) speaks in Plato.
“For there are (as they say) in the mysteries many bearers of the
thyrsus, but few bacchanals;” meaning, “that many are called, but few
chosen.” He accordingly plainly adds: “These, in my opinion, are none
else than those who have philosophized right; to belong to whose number,
I myself have left nothing undone in life, as far as I could, but have
endeavoured in every way. Whether we have endeavoured rightly and
achieved aught, we shall know when we have gone there, if God will, a
little afterwards.” Does he not then seem to declare from the Hebrew
Scriptures the righteous man’s hope, through faith, after death? And in
*Demodocus* <span id="fr_2007"></span>[2008](#fn_2007.md) (if that is
really the work of Plato): “And do not imagine that I call it
philosophizing to spend life pottering about the arts, or learning many
<span id="page_322">p. 322</span> <span
id="vi.iv.i.xix-Page_322"></span>things, but something different; since
I, at least, would consider this a disgrace.” For he knew, I reckon,
“that the knowledge of many things does not educate the mind,” <span
id="fr_2008"></span>[2009](#fn_2008.md) according to Heraclitus. And in the
fifth book of the *Republic,* <span id="fr_2009"></span>[2010](#fn_2009.md)
he says, “‘Shall we then call all these, and the others which study such
things, and those who apply themselves to the meaner arts,
philosophers?’ ‘By no means,’ I said, ‘but like philosophers.’ ‘And
whom,’ said he, ‘do you call true?’ ‘Those,’ said I, ‘who delight in the
contemplation of truth. For philosophy is not in geometry, with its
postulates and hypotheses; nor in music, which is conjectural; nor in
astronomy, crammed full of physical, fluid, and probable causes. But the
knowledge of the good and truth itself are requisite,—what is good being
one thing, and the ways to the good another.’” <span
id="fr_2010"></span>[2011](#fn_2010.md) So that he does not allow that the
curriculum of training suffices for the good, but co-operates in rousing
and training the soul to intellectual objects. Whether, then, they say
that the Greeks gave forth some utterances of the true philosophy by
accident, it is the accident of a divine administration (for no one
will, for the sake of the present argument with us, deify chance); or by
good fortune, good fortune is not unforeseen. Or were one, on the other
hand, to say that the Greeks possessed a natural conception of these
things, we know the one Creator of nature; just as we also call
righteousness natural; or that they had a common intellect, let us
reflect who is its father, and what righteousness is in the mental
economy. For were one to name “prediction,” <span
id="fr_2011"></span>[2012](#fn_2011.md) and assign as its cause “combined
utterance,” <span id="fr_2012"></span>[2013](#fn_2012.md) he specifies
forms of prophecy. Further, others will have it that some truths were
uttered by the philosophers, in appearance.

<span id="vi.iv.i.xix-p13"></span>The divine apostle writes accordingly
respecting us: “For now we see as through a glass;” <span
id="fr_2013"></span>[2014](#fn_2013.md) knowing ourselves in it by
reflection, and simultaneously contemplating, as we can, the efficient
cause, from that, which, in us, is divine. For it is said, “Having seen
thy brother, thou hast seen thy God:” methinks that now the Saviour God
is declared to us. But after the laying aside of the flesh, “face to
face,”—then definitely and comprehensively, when the heart becomes pure.
And by reflection and direct vision, those among the Greeks who have
philosophized accurately, see God. For such, through our weakness, are
our true views, as images are seen in the water, and as we see things
through pellucid and transparent bodies. Excellently therefore Solomon
says: “He who soweth righteousness, worketh faith.” <span
id="fr_2014"></span>[2015](#fn_2014.md) “And there are those who, sewing
their own, make increase.” <span id="fr_2015"></span>[2016](#fn_2015.md)
And again: “Take care of the verdure on the plain, and thou shalt cut
grass and gather ripe hay, that thou mayest have sheep for
clothing.” <span id="fr_2016"></span>[2017](#fn_2016.md) You see how care
must be taken for external clothing and for keeping. “And thou shalt
intelligently know the souls of thy flock.” <span
id="fr_2017"></span>[2018](#fn_2017.md) “For when the Gentiles, which have
not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having
not the law, are a law unto themselves; uncircumcision observing the
precepts of the law,” <span id="fr_2018"></span>[2019](#fn_2018.md)
according to the apostle, both before the law and before the advent. As
if making comparison of those addicted to philosophy with those called
heretics, <span id="fr_2019"></span>[2020](#fn_2019.md) the Word most
clearly says: “Better is a friend that is near, than a brother that
dwelleth afar off.” <span id="fr_2020"></span>[2021](#fn_2020.md) “And he
who relies on falsehoods, feeds on the winds, and pursues winged
birds.” <span id="fr_2021"></span>[2022](#fn_2021.md) I do not think that
philosophy directly declares the Word, although in many instances
philosophy attempts and persuasively teaches us probable arguments; but
it assails the sects. Accordingly it is added: “For he hath forsaken the
ways of his own vineyard, and wandered in the tracks of his own
husbandry.” Such are the sects which deserted the primitive
Church. <span id="fr_2022"></span>[2023](#fn_2022.md) Now he who has fallen
into heresy passes through an arid wilderness, abandoning the only true
God, destitute of God, seeking waterless water, reaching an uninhabited
and thirsty land, collecting sterility with his hands. And those
destitute of prudence, that is, those involved in heresies, “I enjoin,”
remarks Wisdom, saying, “Touch sweetly stolen bread and the sweet water
of theft;” <span id="fr_2023"></span>[2024](#fn_2023.md) the Scripture
manifestly applying the terms bread and water to nothing else but to
those heresies, which employ bread and water in the oblation, not
according to the canon of the Church. For there are those who celebrate
the Eucharist with mere water. “But begone, stay not in her place:”
*place* is the synagogue, not the Church. He calls it by the equivocal
name, *place*. Then He subjoins: “For so shalt thou pass through the
water of another;” reckoning heretical baptism not proper and true
water. “And thou shalt pass over another’s river,” that rushes along and
sweeps down to the sea; into which he is cast who, having diverged from
the stability which is according to truth, rushes back into the
heathenish and tumultous waves of life.

in the arts, nor lead a life of bustling, meddling activity, nor to
learn many things; but it is something else. Since I, at least, would
reckon this a reproach; and that those who devote themselves to the arts
ought to be called mechanics.”
