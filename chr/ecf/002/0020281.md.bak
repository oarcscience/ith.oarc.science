##### <span id="vi.iii.iii.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.—Against Men Who Embellish Themselves.

<span id="vi.iii.iii.iii-p1"></span>To such an extent, then, has luxury
advanced, that not only are the female sex deranged about this frivolous
pursuit, but men also are infected with the disease. <span
id="fr_1594"></span>[1595](#fn_1594.md) For not being free of the love of
finery, they are not in health; but inclining to voluptuousness, they
become effeminate, cutting their hair in an ungentlemanlike and
meretricious way, clothed in fine and transparent garments, chewing
mastich, <span id="fr_1595"></span>[1596](#fn_1595.md) smelling of
perfume. <span id="fr_1596"></span>[1597](#fn_1596.md) What can one say on
seeing them? Like one who judges people by their foreheads, he will
divine them to be adulterers and effeminate, addicted to both kinds of
venery, haters of hair, destitute of hair, detesting the bloom of
manliness, and adorning their locks like women. “Living for unholy acts
of audacity, these fickle wretches do reckless and nefarious deeds,”
says the Sibyl. For their service the towns are full of those who take
out hair by pitch-plasters, shave, and pluck out hairs from these
womanish creatures. And shops are erected and opened everywhere; and
adepts at this meretricious fornication make a deal of money openly by
those who plaster themselves, and give their hair to be pulled out in
all ways by those who make it their trade, feeling no shame before the
onlookers or those who approach, nor before themselves, being men. Such
are those addicted to base passions, whose whole body is made smooth by
the violent tuggings of pitch-plasters. It is utterly impossible to get
beyond such effrontery. If nothing is left undone by them, neither shall
anything be left unspoken by me. Diogenes, when he was being sold,
chiding like a teacher one of these degenerate creatures, said very
manfully, “Come, youngster, buy for yourself a man,” chastising his
meretriciousness by an ambiguous speech. But for those who are men to
shave and smooth themselves, how ignoble! As for dyeing of hair, and
anointing of grey locks, and dyeing them yellow, these are practices of
abandoned effeminates; and their feminine combing of themselves is a
thing to be let alone. For they think, that like serpents they divest
themselves of the old age of their head by painting and renovating
themselves. But though they do doctor the hair cleverly, they will not
escape wrinkles, nor will they elude death by tricking time. For it is
not dreadful, it is not dreadful to appear old, when you are not able to
shut your eyes to the fact that you are so.

<span id="vi.iii.iii.iii-p5"></span>The more, then, a man hastes to the
end, the more truly venerable is he, having God alone as his senior,
since He is the eternal aged One, He who is older than all things.
Prophecy has called him the “Ancient of days; and the hair of His head
was as pure wool,” says the prophet. <span
id="fr_1597"></span>[1598](#fn_1597.md) “And none other,” says the Lord,
“can make the hair white or black.” <span
id="fr_1598"></span>[1599](#fn_1598.md) How, then, do these godless ones
work in rivalry with God, or rather violently oppose Him, when they
transmute the hair made white by Him? “The crown of old men is great
experience,” <span id="fr_1599"></span>[1600](#fn_1599.md) says Scripture;
and the hoary hair of their countenance is the blossom of large
experience. But these dishonour the reverence of age, the head covered
with grey hairs. It is not, it is not possible for him to show the head
true who has a fraudulent head. “But ye have not so learned Christ; if
so be that ye have heard Him, and have been taught by Him, as the truth
is in Jesus: that ye put off, concerning the former conversation, the
old man (not the hoary man, but him that is) corrupt according to
deceitful lusts; and be renewed (not by dyeings and ornaments), but in
the spirit of your mind; and put on the new man, which after God is
created in righteousness and true holiness.” <span
id="fr_1600"></span>[1601](#fn_1600.md)

<span id="vi.iii.iii.iii-p10"></span>But for one who is a man to comb
himself and shave himself with a razor, for the sake of fine effect, to
arrange his hair at the looking-glass, to shave his cheeks, pluck hairs
out of them, and smooth them, how womanly! And, in truth, unless you saw
them naked, you would suppose them to be women. For although not allowed
to wear gold, yet out of effeminate desire they enwreath their latches
and fringes with leaves of gold; or, getting certain spherical figures
of the same metal made, they fasten them to their ankles, and hang them
from their necks. This is a device of enervated men, who are dragged to
the women’s apartments, amphibious and lecherous beasts. For this is a
meretricious and impious form of snare. For God wished women to be
smooth, and rejoice in their locks alone growing spontaneously, as a
horse in his mane; but has adorned man, like the lions, with a beard,
and endowed him, as an attribute of manhood, with shaggy breasts,—a sign
this of strength and rule. So also cocks, which fight in defence of the
hens, he has decked with combs, as it were helmets; and so high a value
does God set on these locks, that He orders them to make their
appearance on men simultaneously with discretion, and delighted with a
venerable look, has honoured gravity of countenance with grey hairs. But
wisdom, and discriminating judgments that are hoary with <span
id="page_276">p. 276</span> <span
id="vi.iii.iii.iii-Page_276"></span>wisdom, attain maturity with time,
and by the vigour of long experience give strength to old age, producing
grey hairs, the admirable flower of venerable wisdom, conciliating
confidence. This, then, the mark of the man, the beard, by which he is
seen to be a man, is older than Eve, and is the token of the superior
nature. In this God deemed it right that he should excel, and dispersed
hair over man’s whole body. Whatever smoothness and softness was in him
He abstracted from his side when He formed the woman Eve, physically
receptive, his partner in parentage, his help in household management,
while he (for he had parted with all smoothness) remained a man, and
shows himself man. And to him has been assigned action, as to her
suffering; for what is shaggy is drier and warmer than what is smooth.
Wherefore males have both more hair and more heat than females, animals
that are entire than the emasculated, perfect than imperfect. It is
therefore impious to desecrate the symbol of manhood, hairiness. <span
id="fr_1601"></span>[1602](#fn_1601.md) But the embellishment of smoothing
(for I am warned by the Word), if it is to attract men, is the act of an
effeminate person,—if to attract women, is the act of an adulterer; and
both must be driven as far as possible from our society. “But the very
hairs of your head are all numbered,” says the Lord; <span
id="fr_1602"></span>[1603](#fn_1602.md) those on the chin, too, are
numbered, and those on the whole body. There must be therefore no
plucking out, contrary to God’s appointment, which has counted <span
id="fr_1603"></span>[1604](#fn_1603.md) them in according to His will.
“Know ye not yourselves,” says the apostle, “that Christ Jesus is in
you?” <span id="fr_1604"></span>[1605](#fn_1604.md) Whom, had we known as
dwelling in us, I know not how we could have dared to dishonour. But the
using of pitch to pluck out hair (I shrink from even mentioning the
shamelessness connected with this process), and in the act of bending
back and bending down, the violence done to nature’s modesty by stepping
out and bending backwards in shameful postures, yet the doers not
ashamed of themselves, but conducting themselves without shame in the
midst of the youth, and in the gymnasium, where the prowess of man is
tried; the following of this unnatural practice, is it not the extreme
of licentiousness? For those who engage in such practices in public will
scarcely behave with modesty to any at home. Their want of shame in
public attests their unbridled licentiousness in private. <span
id="fr_1605"></span>[1606](#fn_1605.md) For he who in the light of day
denies his manhood, will prove himself manifestly a woman by night.
“There shall not be,” said the Word by Moses, “a harlot of the daughters
of Israel; there shall not be a fornicator of the sons of Israel.” <span
id="fr_1606"></span>[1607](#fn_1606.md)

<span id="vi.iii.iii.iii-p17"></span>But the pitch does good, it is
said. Nay, it defames, say I. No one who entertains right sentiments
would wish to appear a fornicator, were he not the victim of that vice,
and study to defame the beauty of his form. No one would, I say,
voluntarily choose to do this. “For if God foreknew those who are
called, according to His purpose, to be conformed to the image of His
Son,” for whose sake, according to the blessed apostle, He has appointed
“Him to be the first-born among many brethren,” <span
id="fr_1607"></span>[1608](#fn_1607.md) are they not godless who treat with
indignity the body which is of like form with the Lord?

<span id="vi.iii.iii.iii-p19"></span>The man, who would be beautiful,
must adorn that which is the most beautiful thing in man, his mind,
which every day he ought to exhibit in greater comeliness; and should
pluck out not hairs, but lusts. I pity the boys possessed by the
slave-dealers, that are decked for dishonour. But they are not treated
with ignominy by themselves, but by command the wretches are adorned for
base gain. But how disgusting are those who willingly practice the
things to which, if compelled, they would, if they were men, die rather
than do?

<span id="vi.iii.iii.iii-p20"></span>But life has reached this pitch of
licentiousness through the wantonness of wickedness, and lasciviousness
is diffused over the cities, having become law. Beside them women stand
in the stews, offering their own flesh for hire for lewd pleasure, and
boys, taught to deny their sex, act the part of women.

<span id="vi.iii.iii.iii-p21"></span>Luxury has deranged all things; it
has disgraced man. A luxurious niceness seeks everything, attempts
everything, forces everything, coerces nature. Men play the part of
women, and women that of men, contrary to nature; women are at once
wives and husbands: no passage is closed against libidinousness; and
their promiscuous lechery is a public institution, and luxury is
domesticated. O miserable spectacle! horrible conduct! Such are the
trophies of your social licentiousness which are exhibited: the evidence
of these deeds are the prostitutes. Alas for such wickedness! Besides,
the wretches know not how many tragedies the uncertainty of intercourse
produces. For fathers, unmindful of children of theirs that have been
exposed, often without their knowledge, have intercourse with a son that
has debauched himself, and daughters that are prostitutes; and licence
in lust shows them to be the men that have begotten them. <span
id="page_277">p. 277</span> <span
id="vi.iii.iii.iii-Page_277"></span>These things your wise laws allow:
people may sin legally; and the execrable indulgence in pleasure they
call a thing indifferent. They who commit adultery against nature think
themselves free from adultery. Avenging justice follows their audacious
deeds, and, dragging on themselves inevitable calamity, they purchase
death for a small sum of money. The miserable dealers in these wares
sail, bringing a cargo of fornication, like wine or oil; and others, far
more wretched, traffic in pleasures as they do in bread and sauce, not
heeding the words of Moses, “Do not prostitute thy daughter, to cause
her to be a whore, lest the land fall to whoredom, and the land become
full of wickedness.” <span id="fr_1608"></span>[1609](#fn_1608.md)

<span id="vi.iii.iii.iii-p23"></span>Such was predicted of old, and the
result is notorious: the whole earth has now become full of fornication
and wickedness. I admire the ancient legislators of the Romans: these
detested effeminacy of conduct; and the giving of the body to feminine
purposes, contrary to the law of nature, they judged worthy of the
extremest penalty, according to the righteousness of the law.

<span id="vi.iii.iii.iii-p24"></span>For it is not lawful to pluck out
the beard, <span id="fr_1609"></span>[1610](#fn_1609.md) man’s natural and
noble ornament.

> <span id="vi.iii.iii.iii-p25.1"></span> “A youth with his first beard:
> for with this, youth is most graceful.”  

<span id="vi.iii.iii.iii-p26"></span>By and by he is anointed,
delighting in the beard “on which descended” the prophetic
“ointment” <span id="fr_1610"></span>[1611](#fn_1610.md) with which Aaron
was honoured.

<span id="vi.iii.iii.iii-p28"></span>And it becomes him who is rightly
trained, on whom peace has pitched its tent, to preserve peace also with
his hair.

<span id="vi.iii.iii.iii-p29"></span>What, then, will not women with
strong propensities to lust practice, when they look on men perpetrating
such enormities? Rather we ought not to call such as these men, but lewd
wretches (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iii.iii.iii-p29.1"></span>βατάλοι</span>), and effeminate (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.iii.iii.iii-p29.2"></span>γύνιδες</span>),
whose voices are feeble, and whose clothes are womanish both in feel and
dye. And such creatures are manifestly shown to be what they are from
their external appearance, their clothes, shoes, form, walk, cut of
their hair, look. “For from his look shall a man be known,” says the
Scripture, “from meeting a man the man is known: the dress of a man, the
step of his foot, the laugh of his teeth, tell tales of him.” <span
id="fr_1611"></span>[1612](#fn_1611.md)

<span id="vi.iii.iii.iii-p31"></span>For these, for the most part,
plucking out the rest of their hair, only dress that on the head, all
but binding their locks with fillets like women. Lions glory in their
shaggy hair, but are armed by their hair in the fight; and boars even
are made imposing by their mane; the hunters are afraid of them when
they see them bristling their hair.

> <span id="vi.iii.iii.iii-p31.1"></span> “The fleecy sheep are loaded
> with their wool.” <span id="fr_1612"></span>[1613](#fn_1612.md)  

<span id="vi.iii.iii.iii-p33"></span>And their wool the loving Father
has made abundant for thy use, O man, having taught thee to sheer their
fleeces. Of the nations, the Celts and Scythians wear their hair long,
but do not deck themselves. The bushy hair of the barbarian has
something fearful in it; and its auburn (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iii.iii.iii-p33.1"></span>ξανθόν</span>) colour threatens war,
the hue being somewhat akin to blood. Both these barbarian races hate
luxury. As clear witnesses will be produced by the German, the
Rhine; <span id="fr_1613"></span>[1614](#fn_1613.md) and by the Scythian,
the waggon. Sometimes the Scythian despises even the waggon: its size
seems sumptuousness to the barbarian; and leaving its luxurious ease,
the Scythian man leads a frugal life. For a house sufficient, and less
encumbered than the waggon, he takes his horse, and mounting it, is
borne where he wishes. And when faint with hunger, he asks his horse for
sustenance; and he offers his veins, and supplies his master with all he
possesses—his blood. To the nomad the horse is at once conveyance and
sustenance; and the warlike youth of the Arabians (these are other
nomads) are mounted on camels. They sit on breeding camels; and these
feed and run at the same time, carrying their masters the whilst, and
bear the house with them. And if drink fail the barbarians, they milk
them; and after that their food is spent, they do not spare even their
blood, as is reported of furious wolves. And these, gentler than the
barbarians, when injured, bear no remembrance of the wrong, but sweep
bravely over the desert, carrying and nourishing their masters at the
same time.

<span id="vi.iii.iii.iii-p35"></span>Perish, then, the savage beasts
whose food is blood! For it is unlawful for men, whose body is nothing
but flesh elaborated of blood, to touch blood. For human blood has
become a partaker of the Word: <span
id="fr_1614"></span>[1615](#fn_1614.md) it is a participant of grace by the
Spirit; and if any one injure him, he will not escape unnoticed. Man
may, though naked in body, address the Lord. But I approve the
simplicity of the barbarians: loving an unencumbered life, the
barbarians have abandoned luxury. Such the Lord calls us to be—naked of
finery, naked of vanity, wrenched from our sins, bearing only the wood
of life, aiming only at salvation.
