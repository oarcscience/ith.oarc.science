##### <span id="v.ii.xxxii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXII.—Elevated Morality of the Christians.

<span id="v.ii.xxxii-p1"></span>It is, however, nothing wonderful that
they should get up tales about us such as they tell of their own gods,
of the incidents of whose lives they make mysteries. But it behoved
them, if they meant to condemn shameless and promiscuous intercourse, to
hate either Zeus, who begat children of his mother Rhea and his daughter
Koré, and took his own sister to wife, or Orpheus, the inventor of these
tales, which made Zeus more unholy and detestable than Thyestes himself;
for the latter defiled his daughter in pursuance of an oracle, and when
he wanted to obtain the kingdom and avenge himself. But we are so far
from practising promiscuous intercourse, that it is not lawful among us
to indulge even a lustful look. “For,” saith He, “he that looketh on a
woman to lust after her, hath committed adultery already in his
heart.” <span id="fr_819"></span>[820](#fn_819.md) Those, then, who are
forbidden to look at anything more than that for which God formed the
eyes, which were intended to be a light to us, and to whom a wanton look
is adultery, the eyes being made for other purposes, and who are to be
called to account for their very thoughts, how can any one doubt that
such persons practice self-control? For our account lies not with human
laws, which a bad man can evade (at the outset I proved to you,
sovereign lords, that our doctrine is from the teaching of God), but we
have a law which makes the measure of rectitude to consist in dealing
with our neighbour as ourselves. <span id="fr_820"></span>[821](#fn_820.md)
On this account, too, according to age, we recognise some as sons and
daughters, others we regard as brothers and sisters, <span
id="fr_821"></span>[822](#fn_821.md) and to the more advanced in life we
give the honour due to fathers and mothers. On behalf of those, then, to
whom we apply the names of brothers and sisters, and other designations
of relationship, we exercise the greatest care that their bodies should
remain undefiled and uncorrupted; for the Logos <span
id="fr_822"></span>[823](#fn_822.md) again says to us, “If any one kiss a
second time because it has given him pleasure, \[he sins\];” adding,
“Therefore the kiss, or rather the salutation, should be given with the
greatest care, since, if there be mixed with it the least defilement of
thought, it excludes us from eternal life.” <span
id="fr_823"></span>[824](#fn_823.md)

<span id="v.ii.xxxii-p3"></span> Otto translates: “which has made us and
our neighbours attain the highest degree of rectitude.” The text is
obscure, but the above seems the probably meaning; comp. [Matt. xxii.
39](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#039.md)<span id="v.ii.xxxii-p3.1"></span>,
etc.

<span id="v.ii.xxxii-p5"></span> \[The Logos never said, “it excludes
*us* from eternal life:” that is sure; and the passage, though
ambiguous, is not so interpreted in the Latin of Gesner. Jones remarks
that Athenagoras never introduces a saying of our Lord in this way.
Compare Clem. Alexandrin. (*Pædagogue*, b. iii. cap. v. p. 297,
Edinburgh Series), where he quotes [Matt. v.
28](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#028.md)<span id="v.ii.xxxii-p5.1"></span>,
with variation. Lardner (cap. xviii. sec. 20) gives a probable
explanation. Jones on *The Canon* (vol. i. p. 436) is noteworthy. Kaye
(p. 221) does not solve the puzzle.\]

<span id="v.ii.xxxii-p6"></span> Probably from some apocryphal writing.
\[Come from what source it may, it suggests a caution of the utmost
importance to Americans. In the newer parts of the country, the
practice, here corrected, as cropped out among “brothers and sisters” of
divers religious names, and consequent scandals have arisen. To all
Christians comes, the apostolic appeal, “Let it not be once named among
you.”\]
