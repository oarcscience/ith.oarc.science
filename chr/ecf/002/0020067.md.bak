##### <span id="iii.ii.xxxi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXI.—The Philosophy of the Christians More Ancient Than that of the Greeks.

<span id="iii.ii.xxxi-p1"></span>But now it seems proper for me to
demonstrate that our philosophy is older than the systems of the Greeks.
Moses and Homer shall be our limits, each of them being of great
antiquity; the one being the oldest of poets and historians, and the
other the founder of all barbarian wisdom. Let us, then, institute a
comparison between them; and we shall find that our doctrines are older,
not only than those of the Greeks, but than the invention of
letters. <span id="fr_500"></span>[501](#fn_500.md) And I will not bring
forward witnesses from among ourselves, but rather have recourse to
Greeks. To do the former would be foolish, because it would not be
allowed by you; but the other will surprise you, when, by contending
against you with your own weapons, I adduce arguments of which you had
no suspicion. Now the poetry of Homer, his parentage, and the time in
which he flourished have been investigated by the most ancient
writers,—by Theagenes of Rhegium, who lived in the time of Cambyses,
Stesimbrotus <span id="page_78">p. 78</span> <span
id="iii.ii.xxxi-Page_78"></span>of Thasos and Antimachus of Colophon,
Herodotus of Halicarnassus, and Dionysius the Olynthian; after them, by
Ephorus of Cumæ, and Philochorus the Athenian, Megaclides and Chamæleon
the Peripatetics; afterwards by the grammarians, Zenodotus,
Aristophanes, Callimachus, Crates, Eratosthenes, Aristarchus, and
Apollodorus. Of these, Crates says that he flourished before the return
of the Heraclidæ, and within 80 years after the Trojan war; Eratosthenes
says that it was after the 100th year from the taking of Ilium;
Aristarchus, that it was about the time of the Ionian migration, which
was 140 years after that event; but, according to Philochorus, after the
Ionian migration, in the archonship of Archippus at Athens, 180 years
after the Trojan war; Apollodorus says it was 100 years after the Ionian
migration, which would be 240 years after the Trojan war. Some say that
he lived 90 years before the Olympiads, which would be 317 years after
the taking of Troy. Others carry it down to a later date, and say that
Homer was a contemporary of Archilochus; but Archilochus flourished
about the 23d Olympiad, in the time of Gyges the Lydian, 500 years after
Troy. Thus, concerning the age of the aforesaid poet, I mean Homer, and
the discrepancies of those who have spoken of him, we have said enough
in a summary manner for those who are able to investigate with accuracy.
For it is possible to show that the opinions held about the facts
themselves also are false. For, where the assigned dates do not agree
together, it is impossible that the history should be true. For what is
the cause of error in writing, but the narrating of things that are not
true?
