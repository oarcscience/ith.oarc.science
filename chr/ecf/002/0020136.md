<span id="iv.ii.ii.xxxviii"></span>

##### <span id="iv.ii.ii.xxxviii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXVIII.—The Teachings of the Greek Poets and Philosophers Confirmatory of Those of the Hebrew Prophets.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xxxviii-p1"></span>But what matters it whether they
were before or after them? Certainly they did at all events utter things
confirmatory of the prophets. Concerning the burning up of the world,
Malachi the prophet foretold: “The day of the Lord cometh as a burning
oven, and shall consume all the wicked.” <span
id="fr_628"></span>[629](#fn_628) And Isaiah: “For the wrath of God is
as a violent hail-storm, and as a rushing mountain torrent.” <span
id="fr_629"></span>[630](#fn_629) The Sibyl, then, and the other
prophets, yea, and the poets and philosophers, have clearly taught both
concerning righteousness, and judgment, and punishment; and also
concerning providence, that God cares for us, not only for the living
among us, but also for those that are dead: though, indeed, they said
this unwillingly, for they were convinced by the truth. And among the
prophets indeed, Solomon said of the dead, “There shall be healing to
thy flesh, and care taken of thy bones.” <span
id="fr_630"></span>[631](#fn_630) And the same says David, “The bones
which Thou hast broken shall rejoice.” <span
id="fr_631"></span>[632](#fn_631) And in agreement with these sayings
was that of Timocles:—

> <span id="iv.ii.ii.xxxviii-p5.2"></span> “The dead are pitied by the
> loving God.”  

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xxxviii-p6"></span>And the writers who spoke of a
multiplicity of gods came at length to the doctrine of the unity of God,
and those who asserted chance spoke also of providence; and the
advocates of impunity confessed there would be a judgment, and those who
denied that there is a sensation after death acknowledged that there is.
Homer, accordingly, though he had said,—

> <span id="iv.ii.ii.xxxviii-p6.1"></span> “Like fleeting vision passed
> the soul away,” <span id="fr_632"></span>[633](#fn_632)  

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xxxviii-p8"></span>says in another place:—

> <span id="iv.ii.ii.xxxviii-p8.1"></span> “To Hades went the
> disembodied soul;” <span id="fr_633"></span>[634](#fn_633)  

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xxxviii-p10"></span>And again:—

> <span id="iv.ii.ii.xxxviii-p10.1"></span> “That I may quickly pass
> through Hades’ gates,  
> Me bury.” <span id="fr_634"></span>[635](#fn_634)  

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xxxviii-p12"></span>And as regards the others whom
you have read, I think you know with sufficient accuracy how they have
expressed themselves. But all these things will every one understand who
seeks the wisdom of God, and is well pleasing to Him through faith and
righteousness and the doing of good works. For one of the prophets whom
we already mentioned, Hosea by name, said, “Who is wise, and he shall
understand these things? prudent, and he shall know them? for the ways
of the Lord are right, and the just shall walk in them: but the
transgressors shall fall therein.” <span
id="fr_635"></span>[636](#fn_635) He, then, who is desirous of learning,
should learn much. <span id="fr_636"></span>[637](#fn_636) Endeavour
therefore to meet \[with me\] more frequently, that, by hearing the
living voice, you may accurately ascertain the truth.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xxxviii-p14"></span> We have adopted the reading of
Wolf in the text. The reading of the <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.ii.ii.xxxviii-p14.1"></span>mss</span>. is, “He who desires to
learn should desire to learn.” Perhaps the most satisfactory emendation
is that of Heumann, who reads <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.ii.ii.xxxviii-p14.2"></span>φιλομυθεῖν</span> instead of <span
class="Greek"><span
id="iv.ii.ii.xxxviii-p14.3"></span>φιλομαθεῖν</span>: “He who desires to
learn should also desire to discuss subjects, and hold conversations on
them.” In this case, Theophilus most probably borrows his remark from
Aristotle, *Metaphysic*. i. c. 2.
