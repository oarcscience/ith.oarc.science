##### <span id="v.ii.xx-p0.1"></span>Chapter XX.—Absurd Representations of the Gods.

<span id="v.ii.xx-p1"></span>If the absurdity of their theology were
confined to saying that the gods were created, and owed their
constitution to water, since I have demonstrated that nothing is made
which is not also liable to dissolution, I might proceed to the
remaining charges. But, on the one hand, they have described their
bodily forms: speaking of Hercules, for instance, as a god in the shape
of a dragon coiled up; of others as hundred-handed; of the daughter of
Zeus, whom he begat of his mother Rhea; or of Demeter, as having two
eyes in the natural order, and two in her forehead, and the face of an
animal on the back part of her neck, and as having also horns, so that
Rhea, frightened at her monster of a child, fled from her, and did not
give her the breast (<span class="Greek"><span
id="v.ii.xx-p1.1"></span>θηλή</span>), whence mystically she is called
Athêlâ, but commonly Phersephoné and Koré, though she is not the same as
Athênâ, <span id="fr_761"></span>[762](#fn_761.md) who is called Koré from
the pupil of the eye;—and, on the other hand, they have described their
admirable <span id="fr_762"></span>[763](#fn_762.md) achievements, as they
deem them: how Kronos, for instance, mutilated his father, and hurled
him down from his chariot, and how he murdered his children, and
swallowed the males of them; and how Zeus bound his father, and cast him
down to Tartarus, as did Ouranos also to his sons, and fought with the
Titans for the government; and how he persecuted his mother Rhea when
she refused to wed him, and, she becoming a she-dragon, and he himself
being changed into a dragon, bound her with what is called the Herculean
knot, and accomplished his purpose, of which fact the rod of Hermes is a
symbol; and again, how he violated his daughter Phersephoné, in this
case also assuming the form of a dragon, and became the father of
Dionysus. In face of narrations like these, I must say at least this
much, What that is becoming or useful is there in such a history, that
we must believe Kronos, Zeus, Koré, and the rest, to be gods? Is it the
descriptions of their bodies? Why, what man of judgment and reflection
will believe that a viper was begotten by a god (thus Orpheus:—

> <span id="v.ii.xx-p3.1"></span> “But from the sacred womb Phanes
> begat  
> Another offspring, horrible and fierce,  
> In sight a frightful viper, on whose head  
> Were hairs: its face was comely; but the rest,  
> From the neck downwards, bore the aspect dire  
> Of a dread dragon” <span id="fr_763"></span>[764](#fn_763) .md);  

<span id="v.ii.xx-p5"></span>or who will admit that Phanes himself,
being a first-born god (for he it was that was produced from the egg),
has the body or shape of a dragon, or was swallowed by Zeus, that Zeus
might be too large to be contained? For if they differ in no respect
from the lowest brutes (since it is evident that the Deity must differ
from the things of earth and those that are derived from matter), they
are not gods. How, then, I ask, can we approach them as suppliants, when
their origin resembles that of cattle, and they themselves have the form
of brutes, and are ugly to behold?
