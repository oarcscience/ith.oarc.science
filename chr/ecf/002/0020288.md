##### <span id="vi.iii.iii.x-p0.1"></span>Chapter X.—The Exercises Suited to a Good Life.

<span id="vi.iii.iii.x-p1"></span>The gymnasium is sufficient for boys,
even if a bath is within reach. And even for men to prefer gymnastic
exercises by far to the baths, is perchance not bad, since they are in
some respects conducive to the health of young men, and produce
exertion—emulation to aim at not only a healthy habit of body, but
courageousness of soul. When this is done without dragging a man away
from better employments, it is pleasant, and not unprofitable. Nor are
women to be deprived of bodily exercise. But they are not to be
encouraged to engage in wrestling or running, but are to exercise
themselves in spinning, and weaving, and superintending the cooking if
necessary. And they are, with their own hand, to fetch from the store
what we require. And it is no disgrace for them to apply themselves to
the mill. Nor is it a reproach to a wife—housekeeper and helpmeet—to
occupy herself in cooking, so that it may be palatable to her husband.
And if she shake up the couch, reach drink to her husband when thirsty,
set food on the table as neatly as possible, and so give herself
exercise tending to sound health, the Instructor will approve of a woman
like this, who “stretches forth her arms to useful tasks, rests her
hands on the distaff, opens her hand to the pour, and extends her wrist
to the beggar.” <span id="fr_1658"></span>[1659](#fn_1658)

<span id="vi.iii.iii.x-p3"></span>She who emulates Sarah is not ashamed
of that highest of ministries, helping wayfarers. For Abraham said to
her, “Haste, and knead three measures of meal, and make cakes.” <span
id="fr_1659"></span>[1660](#fn_1659) “And Rachel, the daughter of Laban,
came,” it is said, “with her father’s sheep.” <span
id="fr_1660"></span>[1661](#fn_1660) Nor was this enough; but to teach
humility it is added, “for she fed her father’s sheep.” <span
id="fr_1661"></span>[1662](#fn_1661) And innumerable such examples of
frugality and self-help, and also of exercises, are furnished by the
Scriptures. In the case of men, let some strip and engage in wrestling;
let some play at the small ball, especially the game they call
Pheninda, <span id="fr_1662"></span>[1663](#fn_1662) in the sun. To
others who walk into the country, or go down into the town, the walk is
sufficient exercise. And were they to handle the hoe, this stroke of
economy in agricultural labour would not be ungentleman like.

<span id="vi.iii.iii.x-p8"></span>I had almost forgot to say that the
well-known Pittacus, king of Miletus, practiced the laborious exercise
of turning the mill. <span id="fr_1663"></span>[1664](#fn_1663) It is
respectable for a man to draw water for himself, and to cut billets of
wood which he is to use himself. Jacob fed the sheep of Laban that were
left in <span id="page_284">p. 284</span> <span
id="vi.iii.iii.x-Page_284"></span>his charge, having as a royal badge “a
rod of storax,” <span id="fr_1664"></span>[1665](#fn_1664) which aimed
by its wood to change and improve nature. And reading aloud is often an
exercise to many. But let not such athletic contests, as we have
allowed, be undertaken for the sake of vainglory, but for the exuding of
manly sweat. Nor are we to straggle with cunning and showiness, but in a
stand-up wrestling bout, by disentangling of neck, hands, and sides. For
such a struggle with graceful strength is more becoming and manly, being
undertaken for the sake of serviceable and profitable health. But let
those others, who profess the practice of illiberal postures in
gymnastics, be dismissed. We must always aim at moderation. For as it is
best that labour should precede food, so to labour above measure is both
very bad, very exhausting, and apt to make us ill. Neither, then, should
we be idle altogether, nor completely fatigued. For similarly to what we
have laid down with respect to food, are we to do everywhere and with
everything. Our mode of life is not to accustom us to voluptuousness and
licentiousness, nor to the opposite extreme, but to the medium between
these, that which is harmonious and temperate, and free of either evil,
luxury and parsimony. And now, as we have also previously remarked,
attending to one’s own wants is an exercise free of pride,—as, for
example, putting on one’s own shoes, washing one’s own feet, and also
rubbing one’s self when anointed with oil. To render one who has rubbed
you the same service in return, is an exercise of reciprocal justice;
and to sleep beside a sick friend, help the infirm, and supply him who
is in want, are proper exercises. “And Abraham,” it is said, “served up
for three, dinner under a tree, and waited on them as they ate.” <span
id="fr_1665"></span>[1666](#fn_1665) The same with fishing, <span
id="fr_1666"></span>[1667](#fn_1666) as in the case of Peter, if we have
leisure from necessary instructions in the Word. But that is the better
enjoyment which the Lord assigned to the disciple, when He taught him to
“catch men” as fishes in the water.
