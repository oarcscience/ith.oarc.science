##### <span id="iv.ii.i.viii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VIII.—Faith Required in All Matters.

<span id="iv.ii.i.viii-p1"></span>But you do not believe that the dead
are raised. When the resurrection shall take place, then you will
believe, whether you will or no; and your faith shall be reckoned for
unbelief, unless you believe now. And why do you not believe? Do you not
know that faith is the leading principle in all matters? For what
husbandman can reap, unless he first trust his seed to the earth? Or who
can cross the sea, unless he first entrust himself to the boat and the
pilot? And what sick person can be healed, unless first he trust himself
to the care of the physician? And what art or knowledge can any one
learn, unless he first apply and entrust himself to the teacher? If,
then, the husbandman trusts the earth, and the sailor the boat, and the
sick the physician, will you not place confidence in God, even when you
hold so many pledges at His hand? For first He created you out of
nothing, and brought you into existence (for if your father was not, nor
your mother, much more were you yourself at one time not in being), and
formed you out of a small and moist substance, even out of the least
drop, which at one time had itself no being; and God introduced you into
this life. Moreover, you believe that the images made by men are gods,
and do great things; and can you not believe that the God who made you
is able also to make you afterwards? <span
