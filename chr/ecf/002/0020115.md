##### <span id="iv.ii.ii.xvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVII.—Of the Sixth Day.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xvii-p1"></span>And on the sixth day, God having made
the quadrupeds, and wild beasts, and the land reptiles, pronounced no
blessing upon them, reserving His blessing for man, whom He was about to
create on the sixth day. The quadrupeds, too, and wild beasts, were made
for a type of some men, who neither know nor worship God, but mind
earthly things, and repent not. For those who turn from their iniquities
and live righteously, in spirit fly upwards like birds, and mind the
things that are above, and are well-pleasing to the will of God. But
those who do not know nor worship God, are like birds which have wings,
but cannot fly nor soar to the high things of God. Thus, too, though
such persons are called men, yet being pressed down with sins, they mind
grovelling and earthly things. And the animals are named wild beasts
\[<span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.ii.ii.xvii-p1.1"></span>θηρία</span>\], from their being hunted
\[<span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.ii.ii.xvii-p1.2"></span>θηρεύεσθαι</span>\], not as if they had
been made evil or venomous from the first—for nothing was made evil by
God, <span id="fr_586"></span>[587](#fn_586) but all things good, yea,
very good,—but the sin in which man was concerned brought evil upon
them. For when man transgressed, they also transgressed with him. For
as, if the master of the house himself acts rightly, the domestics also
of necessity conduct themselves well; but if the master sins, the
servants also sin with him; so in like manner it came to pass, that in
the case of man’s sin, he being master, all that was subject to him
sinned with him. When, therefore, man again shall have made his way back
to his natural condition, and no longer does evil, those also shall be
restored to their original gentleness.
