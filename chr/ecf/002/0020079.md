### <span id="iii.iii-p0.1"></span>Fragments. <span id="fr_518"></span>[519](#fn_518)

##### <span id="iii.iii-p1.1"></span>I.

<span id="iii.iii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iii-p2.1"></span>In</span> his treatise, *Concerning Perfection
according to the Saviour*, he writes, “Consent indeed fits for prayer,
but fellowship in corruption weakens supplication. At any rate, by the
permission he certainly, though delicately, forbids; for while he
permits them to return to the same on account of Satan and incontinence,
he exhibits a man who will attempt to serve two masters—God by the
‘consent’ ([1 Cor. 7:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#005)<span
id="iii.iii-p2.2"></span>), but by want of consent, incontinence,
fornication, and the devil.”—<span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iii-p2.3"></span>Clem. Alex.</span>: *Strom.*, iii. c. 12.

##### <span id="iii.iii-p2.4"></span>II.

<span id="iii.iii-p3"></span>A certain person inveighs against
generation, calling it corruptible and destructive; and some one does
violence \[to Scripture\], applying to pro-creation the Saviour’s words,
“Lay not up treasure on earth, where moth and rust corrupt;” and he is
not ashamed to add to these the words of the prophet: “You all shall
grow old as a garment, and the moth shall devour you.”

<span id="iii.iii-p4"></span>And, in like manner, they adduce the saying
concerning the resurrection of the dead, “The sons of that world neither
marry nor are given in marriage.”—<span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iii-p4.1"></span>Clem. Alex.</span>: iii. c. 12, § 86.

##### <span id="iii.iii-p4.2"></span>III.

<span id="iii.iii-p5"></span>Tatian, who maintaining the imaginary flesh
of Christ, pronounces all sexual connection impure, who was also the
very violent heresiarch of the Encratites, employs an argument of this
sort: “If any one sows to the flesh, of the flesh he shall reap
corruption;” but he sows to the flesh who is joined to a woman;
therefore he who takes a wife and sows in the flesh, of the flesh he
shall reap corruption.—<span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iii-p5.1"></span>Hieron</span>.: *Com. in Ep. ad Gal.*

##### <span id="iii.iii-p5.2"></span>IV.

<span id="iii.iii-p6"></span>Seceding from the Church, and being elated
and puffed up by a conceit of his teacher, <span
id="fr_519"></span>[520](#fn_519) as if he were superior to the rest, he
formed his own peculiar type of doctrine. Imagining certain invisible
Æons like those of Valentinus, and denouncing marriage as defilement and
fornication in the same way as Marcion and Saturninus, and denying the
salvation of Adam as an opinion of his own.—<span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iii-p7.1"></span>Irenæus</span>: Adv. Hœr., i. 28.

##### <span id="iii.iii-p7.2"></span>V.

<span id="iii.iii-p8"></span>Tatian attempting from time to time to make
use of Paul’s language, that in Adam all die, but ignoring that “where
sin abounded, grace has much more abounded.”—<span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iii-p8.1"></span>Irenæus</span>: *Adv. Heres.*, iii. 37.

##### <span id="iii.iii-p8.2"></span>VI.

<span id="iii.iii-p9"></span>Against Tatian, who says that the words,
“Let there be light,” are to be taken as a prayer. If He who uttered it
knew a superior God, how is it that He says, “I am God, and there is
none beside me”?

<span id="iii.iii-p10"></span>He said that there are punishments for
blasphemies, foolish talking, and licentious words, which are punished
and chastised by the Logos. And he said that women were punished on
account of their hair and ornaments by a power placed over those things,
which also gave strength to Samson by his hair, and punishes those who
by the ornament of their hair are urged on to fornication.—<span
class="sc"><span id="iii.iii-p10.1"></span>Clem. Alex.</span>: *Frag.*

##### <span id="iii.iii-p10.2"></span>VII.

<span id="iii.iii-p11"></span>But Tatian, not understanding that the
expression “Let there be” is not always precative but sometimes
imperative, most impiously imagined concerning God, who said “Let there
be light,” that He prayed rather than commanded light to be, as if, as
he impiously thought, God was in darkness.—<span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iii-p11.1"></span>Origen</span>: *De Orat.*

##### <span id="iii.iii-p11.2"></span>VIII.

<span id="iii.iii-p12"></span>Tatian separates the old man and the new,
but not, as we say, understanding the old man to be the law, and the new
man to be the Gospel. We agree with him in saying the same thing, but
not in the sense he wishes, abrogating the law as if it belonged to
another God.—<span class="sc"><span id="iii.iii-p12.1"></span>Clem.
Alex.</span>: *Strom.*, iii. 12.

##### <span id="iii.iii-p12.2"></span>IX.

<span id="iii.iii-p13"></span>Tatian condemns and rejects not only
marriage, but also meats which God has created for use.—<span
class="sc"><span id="iii.iii-p13.1"></span>Hieron.</span>: *Adv.
Jovin*., i. 3.

##### <span id="iii.iii-p13.2"></span>X.

<span id="iii.iii-p14"></span>“But ye gave the Nazarites wine to drink,
and commanded the prophets, saying, Prophesy not.” On this, perhaps,
Tatian the chief of the Encratites endeavours to build his heresy,
asserting that wine is not to be drunk, since it was <span
id="page_83">p. 83</span> <span id="iii.iii-Page_83"></span>commanded in
the law that the Nazarites were not to drink wine, and now those who
give the Nazarites wine are accused by the prophet.—<span
class="sc"><span id="iii.iii-p14.1"></span>Hieron.</span>: *Com. in
Amos.*

##### <span id="iii.iii-p14.2"></span>XI.

<span id="iii.iii-p15"></span>Tatian, the patriarch of the Encratites,
who himself rejected some of Paul’s Epistles, believed this especially,
that is \[addressed\] to Titus, ought to be declared to be the
apostle’s, thinking little of the assertion of Marcion and others, who
agree with him on this point.—<span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iii-p15.1"></span>Hieron.</span>: *Præf. in Com. ad Tit.*

##### <span id="iii.iii-p15.2"></span>XII.

<span id="iii.iii-p16"></span>\[Archelaus (<span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iii-p16.1"></span>a.d.</span> 280), Bishop of Carrha in
Mesopotamia, classes his countryman Tatian with “Marcion, Sabellius, and
others who have made up for themselves a peculiar science,” i.e., a
theology of their own.—<span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iii-p16.2"></span>Routh</span>: *Reliquiæ*, tom. v. p. 137. But
see Edinburgh Series of this work, vol. xx. p. 267.\]
