##### <span id="vi.iii.i.xi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XI.—That the Word Instructed by the Law and the Prophets.

<span id="vi.iii.i.xi-p1"></span>The mode of His love and His
instruction we have shown as we could. Wherefore He Himself, declaring
Himself very beautifully, likened Himself to a grain of
mustard-seed; <span id="fr_1289"></span>[1290](#fn_1289) and pointed out
the spirituality of the word that is sown, and the productiveness of its
nature, and the magnificence and conspicuousness of the power of the
word; and besides, intimated that the pungency and the purifying virtue
of punishment are profitable on account of its sharpness. By the little
grain, as it is figuratively called, He bestows salvation on all
humanity abundantly. Honey, being very sweet, generates bile, as
goodness begets contempt, which is the cause of sinning. But mustard
lessens bile, that is, anger, and stops inflammation, that is, pride.
From which Word springs the true health of the soul, and its eternal
happy temperament (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iii.i.xi-p2.3"></span>εὐκρασία</span>).

<span id="vi.iii.i.xi-p3"></span>Accordingly, of old He instructed by
Moses, and then by the prophets. Moses, too, was a prophet. For the law
is the training of refractory children. “Having feasted to the full,”
accordingly, it is said, “they rose up to play;” <span
id="fr_1290"></span>[1291](#fn_1290) senseless repletion with victuals
being called <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iii.i.xi-p4.3"></span>χόρτασμα</span> (fodder), not <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.iii.i.xi-p4.4"></span>βρῶμα</span> (food).
And when, having senselessly filled themselves, they senselessly played;
on that account the law was given them, and terror ensued for the
prevention of transgressions and for the promotion of right actions,
securing attention, and so winning to obedience to the true Instructor,
being one and the same Word, and reducing to conformity with the urgent
demands of the law. For Paul says that it was given to be a
“schoolmaster to bring us to Christ.” <span
id="fr_1291"></span>[1292](#fn_1291) So that from this it is clear, that
one alone, true, good, just, in the image and likeness of the Father,
His Son Jesus, the Word of God, is our Instructor; to whom God hath
entrusted us, as an affectionate father commits his children to a worthy
tutor, expressly charging us, “This is my beloved Son: hear Him.” <span
id="fr_1292"></span>[1293](#fn_1292) The divine Instructor is
trustworthy, adorned as He is with three of the fairest
ornament”—knowledge, benevolence, and authority of utterance;—with
knowledge, for He is the paternal wisdom: “All Wisdom is from the Lord,
and with Him for evermore;”—with authority of utterance, for He is God
and Creator: “For all things were made by Him, and without Him was not
anything made;” <span id="fr_1293"></span>[1294](#fn_1293) —and with
benevolence, for He alone gave Himself a sacrifice for us: “For the good
Shepherd giveth His life for the sheep;” <span
id="fr_1294"></span>[1295](#fn_1294) and He has so given it. Now,
benevolence is nothing but wishing to do good to one’s neighbour for his
sake.
