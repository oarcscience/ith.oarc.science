##### <span id="iii.ii.xxxii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXII.—The Doctrine of the Christians, is Opposed to Dissensions, and Fitted for All.

<span id="iii.ii.xxxii-p1"></span>But with us there is no desire of
vainglory, nor do we indulge in a variety of opinions. For having
renounced the popular and earthly, and obeying the commands of God, and
following the law of the Father of immortality, we reject everything
which rests upon human opinion. Not only do the rich among us pursue our
philosophy, but the poor enjoy instruction gratuitously; <span
id="fr_501"></span>[502](#fn_501.md) for the things which come from God
surpass the requital of worldly gifts. Thus we admit all who desire to
hear, even old women and striplings; and, in short, persons of every age
are treated by us with respect, but every kind of licentiousness is kept
at a distance. And in speaking we do not utter falsehood. It would be an
excellent thing if your continuance in unbelief should receive a check;
but, however that may be, let our cause remain confirmed by the judgment
pronounced by God. Laugh, if you please; but you will have to weep
hereafter. Is it not absurd that Nestor, <span
id="fr_502"></span>[503](#fn_502.md) who was slow at cutting his horses’
reins owing to his weak and sluggish old age, is, according to you, to
be admired for attempting to rival the young men in fighting, while you
deride those among us who struggle against old age and occupy themselves
with the things pertaining to God? Who would not laugh when you tell us
that the Amazons, and Semiramis, and certain other warlike women
existed, while you cast reproaches on our maidens? Achilles was a youth,
yet is believed to have been very magnanimous; and Neoptolemus was
younger, but strong; Philoctetes was weak, but the divinity had need of
him against Troy. What sort of man was Thersites? yet he held a command
in the army, and, if he had not through doltishness had such an
unbridled tongue, he would not have been reproached for being
peak-headed and bald. As for those who wish to learn our philosophy, we
do not test them by their looks, nor do we judge of those who come to us
by their outward appearance; for we argue that there may be strength of
mind in all, though they may be weak in body. But your proceedings are
full of envy and abundant stupidity.
