##### <span id="iv.ii.ii.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.—Absurd Opinions of the Philosophers Concerning God.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.iv-p1"></span>Some of the philosophers of the Porch
say that there is no God at all; or, if there is, they say that He cares
for none but Himself; and these views the folly of Epicurus and
Chrysippus has set forth at large. And others say that all things are
produced without external agency, and that the world is uncreated, and
that nature is eternal; <span id="fr_549"></span>[550](#fn_549.md) and have
dared to give out that there is no providence of God at all, but
maintain that God is only each man’s conscience. And others again
maintain that the spirit which pervades all things is God. But Plato and
those of his school acknowledge indeed that God is uncreated, and the
Father and Maker of all things; but then they maintain that matter as
well as God is uncreated, and aver that it is coeval with God. But if
God is uncreated and matter uncreated, God is no longer, according to
the Platonists, the Creator of all things, nor, so far as their opinions
hold, is the monarchy <span id="fr_550"></span>[551](#fn_550.md) of God
established. And further, as God, because He is uncreated, is also
unalterable; so if matter, too, were uncreated, it also would be
unalterable, and equal to God; for that which is created is mutable and
alterable, but that which is uncreated is immutable and unalterable. And
what great thing is it if God made the world out of existent
materials? <span id="fr_551"></span>[552](#fn_551.md) For even a human
artist, when he gets material from some one, makes of it what he
pleases. But the power of God is manifested in this, that out of things
that are not He makes whatever He pleases; just as the bestowal of life
and motion is the prerogative of no other than God alone. For even man
makes indeed an image, but reason and breath, or feeling, he cannot give
to what he has made. But God has this property in excess of what man can
do, in that He makes a work, endowed with reason, life, sensation. As,
therefore, in all these respects God is more powerful than man, so also
in this; that out of things that are not He creates and has created
things that are, and whatever He pleases, as He pleases.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.iv-p2"></span> This is according to the Benedictine
reading: the reading of Wolf, “nature is left to itself,” is also worthy
of consideration.

first principle.
