##### <span id="vi.iv.iv.viii-p0.1"></span>Chapter IX.—Christ’s Sayings Respecting Martyrdom.

<span id="vi.iv.iv.viii-p1"></span>On martyrdom the Lord hath spoken
explicitly, and what is written in different places we bring together.
“But I say unto you, Whosoever shall confess in Me before men, the Son
of man also shall confess before the angels of God; but whosoever shall
deny Me before men, him will I deny before the angels.” <span
id="fr_2781"></span>[2782](#fn_2781) “Whosoever shall be ashamed of Me
or of My words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him shall
the Son of man also be ashamed when He cometh in the glory of His Father
with His angels. <span id="page_422">p. 422</span> <span
id="vi.iv.iv.viii-Page_422"></span>Whosoever therefore shall confess in
Me before men, him will I also confess before my Father in heaven. <span
id="fr_2782"></span>[2783](#fn_2782) “And when they bring you before
synagogues, and rulers, and powers, think not beforehand how ye shall
make your defence, or what ye shall say. For the Holy Spirit shall teach
you in the same hour what ye must say.” <span
id="fr_2783"></span>[2784](#fn_2783) In explanation of this passage,
Heracleon, the most distinguished of the school of Valentinians, says
expressly, “that there is a confession by faith and conduct, and one
with the voice. The confession that is made with the voice, and before
the authorities, is what the most reckon the only confession. Not
soundly: and hypocrites also can confess with this confession. But
neither will this utterance be found to be spoken universally; for all
the saved have confessed with the confession made by the voice, and
departed. <span id="fr_2784"></span>[2785](#fn_2784) Of whom are
Matthew, Philip, Thomas, Levi, and many others. And confession by the
lip is not universal, but partial. But that which He specifies now is
universal, that which is by deeds and actions corresponding to faith in
Him. This confession is followed by that which is partial, that before
the authorities, if necessary, and reason dictate. For he will confess
rightly with his voice who has first confessed by his disposition. <span
id="fr_2785"></span>[2786](#fn_2785) And he has well used, with regard
to those who confess, the expression ‘in Me,’ and applied to those who
deny the expression‘Me.’ For those, though they confess Him with the
voice, yet deny Him, not confessing Him in their conduct. But those
alone confess ‘in Him,’ who live in the confession and conduct according
to Him, in which He also confesses, who is contained in them and held by
them. Wherefore ‘He never can deny Himself.’ And those deny Him who are
not in Him. For He said not, ‘Whosoever shall deny’ in Me, but ‘Me.’ For
no one who is in Him will ever deny Him. And the expression ‘before men’
applies both to the saved and the heathen similarly by conduct before
the one, and by voice before the other. Wherefore they never can deny
Him. But those deny Him who are not in Him.” So far Heracleon. And in
other things he seems to be of the same sentiments with us in this
section; but he has not adverted to this, that if some have not by
conduct and in their life “confessed Christ before men,” they are
manifested to have believed with the heart; by confessing Him with the
mouth at the tribunals, and not denying Him when tortured to the death.
And the disposition being confessed, and especially not being changed by
death at any time, cuts away all passions which were engendered by
corporeal desire. For there is, so to speak, at the close of life a
sudden repentance in action, and a true confession toward Christ, in the
testimony of the voice. But if the Spirit of the Father testifies in us,
how can we be any more hypocrites, who are said to bear testimony with
the voice alone? But it will be given to some, if expedient, to make a
defence, that by their witness and confession all may be benefited—those
in the Church being confirmed, and those of the heathen who have devoted
themselves to the search after salvation wondering and being led to the
faith; and the rest seized with amazement. So that confession is by all
means necessary. <span id="fr_2786"></span>[2787](#fn_2786) For it is in
our power. But to make a defence for our faith is not universally
necessary. For that does not depend on us. “But he that endureth to the
end shall be saved.” For who of those who are wise would not choose to
reign in God, and even to serve? So some “confess that they know God,”
according to the apostle; “but in works they deny Him, being abominable
and disobedient, and to every good work reprobate.” <span
id="fr_2787"></span>[2788](#fn_2787) And these, though they confess
nothing but this, will have done at the end one good work. Their
witness, then, appears to be the cleansing away of sins with glory. For
instance, the Shepherd <span id="fr_2788"></span>[2789](#fn_2788) says:
“You will escape the energy of the wild beast, if your heart become pure
and blameless.” Also the Lord Himself says: “Satan hath desired to sift
you; but I have prayed.” <span id="fr_2789"></span>[2790](#fn_2789)
Alone, therefore, the Lord, for the purification of the men who plotted
against Him and disbelieved Him, “drank the cup;” in imitation of whom
the apostles, that they might be in reality Gnostics, and perfect,
suffered for the Churches which they founded. So, then, also the
Gnostics who tread in the footsteps of the apostles ought to be sinless,
and, out of love to the Lord, to love also their brother; so that, if
occasion call, enduring without stumbling, afflictions for the Church,
“they may drink the cup.” Those who witness in their life by deed, and
at the tribunal by word, whether entertaining hope or surmising fear,
are better than those who confess salvation by their mouth alone. But if
one ascend also to love, he is a really blessed and true martyr, having
confessed perfectly both to the commandments and to God, by the Lord;
whom having loved, he acknowledged a brother, giving himself up wholly
for God, resigning pleasantly and lovingly the man when asked, like a
deposit. <span id="fr_2790"></span>[2791](#fn_2790)
