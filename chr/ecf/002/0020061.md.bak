##### <span id="iii.ii.xxv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXV.—Boastings and Quarrels of the Philosophers.

<span id="iii.ii.xxv-p1"></span>What great and wonderful things have
your philosophers effected? They leave uncovered one of their shoulders;
they let their hair grow long; they cultivate their beards; their nails
are like the claws of wild beasts. Though they say that they want
nothing, yet, like Proteus, <span id="fr_488"></span>[489](#fn_488.md) they
need a currier for their wallet, and a weaver for their mantle, and a
wood-cutter for their staff, and the rich, <span
id="fr_489"></span>[490](#fn_489.md) and a cook also for their gluttony. O
man competing with the dog, <span id="fr_490"></span>[491](#fn_490.md) you
know not God, and so have turned to the imitation of an irrational
animal. You cry out in public with an assumption of authority, and take
upon you to avenge your own self; and if you receive nothing, you
indulge in abuse, and philosophy is with you the art of getting money.
You follow the doctrines of Plato, and a disciple of Epicurus lifts up
his voice to oppose you. Again, you wish to be a disciple of Aristotle,
and a follower of Democritus rails at you. Pythagoras says that he was
Euphorbus, and he is the heir of the <span id="page_76">p. 76</span>
<span id="iii.ii.xxv-Page_76"></span>doctrine of Pherecydes; but
Aristotle impugns the immortality of the soul. You who receive from your
predecessors doctrines which clash with one another, you the
inharmonious, are fighting against the harmonious. One of you asserts
that God is body, but I assert that He is without body; that the world
is indestructible, but I say that it is to be destroyed; that a
conflagration will take place at various times, but I say that it will
come to pass once for all; that Minos and Rhadamanthus are judges, but I
say that God Himself is Judge; that the soul alone is endowed with
immortality, but I say that the flesh also is endowed with it. <span
id="fr_491"></span>[492](#fn_491.md) What injury do we inflict upon you, O
Greeks? Why do you hate those who follow the word of God, as if they
were the vilest of mankind? It is not we who eat human flesh <span
id="fr_492"></span>[493](#fn_492.md) —they among you who assert such a
thing have been suborned as false witnesses; it is among you that Pelops
is made a supper for the gods, although beloved by Poseidon, and Kronos
devours his children, and Zeus swallows Metis.

doctrine of the Latin churches, which is precisely what Tatian denies.\]
