## <span id="iii.i-p0.3"></span>Taitian the Assyrian

<span id="iii.i-p1"></span>\[Translated by J. E. Ryland.\]

<span id="iii.i-p2"></span>\[<span class="sc"><span
id="iii.i-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> 110–172.\] It was my first intention
to make this author a mere appendix to his master, Justin Martyr; for he
stands in an equivocal position, as half Father and half heretic. His
good seems to have been largely due to Justin’s teaching and influence.
One may trust that his falling away, in the decline of life, is
attributable to infirmity of mind and body; his severe asceticism
countenancing this charitable thought. Many instances of human frailty,
which the experience of ages has taught Christians to view with
compassion rather than censure, are doubtless to be ascribed to mental
aberration and decay. Early Christians had not yet been taught this
lesson; for, socially, neither Judaism nor Paganism had wholly
surrendered their unloving influences upon their minds. Moreover, their
high valuation of discipline, as an essential condition of
self-preservation amid the fires of surrounding scorn and hatred, led
them to practice, perhaps too sternly, upon offenders, what they often
heroically performed upon themselves,—the amputation of the scandalous
hand, or the plucking out of the evil eye.

<span id="iii.i-p3"></span>In Tatian, another Assyrian follows the Star
of Bethlehem, from Euphrates and the Tigris. The scanty facts of his
personal history are sufficiently detailed by the translator, in his
Introductory Note. We owe to himself the pleasing story of his
conversion from heathenism. But I think it important to qualify the
impressions the translation may otherwise leave upon the student’s mind,
by a little more sympathy with the better side of his character, and a
more just statement of his great services to the infant Church.

<span id="iii.i-p4"></span>His works, which were very numerous, have
perished, in consequence of his lapse from orthodoxy. Give him due
credit for his *Diatessaron*, of which the very name is a valuable
testimony to the Four Gospels as recognised by the primitive churches.
It is lost, with the “infinite number” of other books which St. Jerome
attributes to him. All honour to this earliest harmonist for such a
work; and let us believe, with Mill and other learned authorities, that,
if Eusebius had seen the work he censures, he might have expressed
himself more charitably concerning it.

<span id="iii.i-p5"></span>We know something of Tatian, already, from
the melancholy pages of Irenæus. Theodoret finds no other fault with his
*Diatessaron* than its omission of the genealogies, which he, probably,
could not harmonize on any theory of his own. The errors into which he
fell in his old age <span id="fr_419"></span>[420](#fn_419.md) were so
absurd, and so contrary to the Church’s doctrine and discipline, that he
could not be tolerated as one of the faithful, without giving to the
heathen new grounds for the malignant slanders with which they were ever
assailing the Christians. At the same time, let us reflect, <span
id="page_62">p. 62</span> <span id="iii.i-Page_62"></span>that his fall
is to be attributed to extravagant ideas of that encraty which is a
precept of the Gospel, and which a pure abhorrence of pagan abominations
led many of the orthodox to practice with extreme rigidity. And this is
the place to say, once for all, that the figures of Elijah upon Mt.
Carmel and of John Baptist in the wilderness, approved by our Lord’s
teachings, but moderated, as a lesson to others, by his own holy but
less austere example, justify the early Church in making room for the
two classes of Christians which must always be found in earnest
religion, and which seem to have their warrant in the fundamental
constitution of human nature. There must be men like St. Paul, living in
the world, though not of it; and there must be men like the Baptist, of
whom the world will say, “he hath a devil.” Marvellously the early
Catholics were piloted between the rocks and the whirlpools, in the
narrow drift of the Gospel; and always the Holy Spirit of counsel and
might was their guardian, amid their terrible trials and temptations.
This must suggest, to every reflecting mind, a gratitude the most
profound. To preserve evangelical encraty, and to restrain fanatical
asceticism, was the spirit of early Christianity, as one sees in the
ethics of Hermas. But the awful malaria of Montanism was even now rising
like a fog of the marshes, and was destined to leave its lasting impress
upon Western Christianity; “forbidding to marry, and commanding to
abstain from meats.” Our author, alas, laid the egg which Tertullian
hatched, and invented terms which that great author raised to their
highest power; for he was rather the disciple of Tatian than of the
Phrygians, though they kindled his strange fire. After Tertullian, the
whole subject of marriage became entangled with sophistries, which have
ever since adhered to the Latin churches, and introduced the most
corrosive results into the vitals of individuals and of nations. Southey
suggests, that, in the Roman Communion, John Wesley would have been
accommodated with full scope for his genius, and canonized as a saint,
while his Anglican mother had no place for him. <span
id="fr_420"></span>[421](#fn_420.md) But, on the other hand, let us reflect
that while Rome had no place for Wiclif and Hus, or Jerome of Prague,
she has used and glorified and canonized many fanatics whose errors were
far more disgraceful than those of Tatian and Tertullian. In fact, she
would have utilized and beatified these very enthusiasts, had they risen
in the Middle Ages, to combine their follies with equal extravagance in
persecuting the Albigenses, while aggrandizing the papal ascendency.

<span id="iii.i-p8"></span>I have enlarged upon the equivocal character
of Tatian with melancholy interest, because I shall make sparing use of
notes, in editing his sole surviving work, pronounced by Eusebius his
masterpiece. I read it with sympathy, admiration, and instruction. I
enjoy his biting satire of heathenism, his Pauline contempt for all
philosophy save that of the Gospel, his touching reference to his own
experiences, and his brilliant delineation of Christian innocence and of
his own emancipation from the seductions of a deceitful and transient
world. In short, I feel that Tatian deserves critical editing, in the
original, at the hand and heart of some expert who can thoroughly
appreciate his merits, and his relations to primitive Christianity.

<span id="iii.i-p9"></span>The following is the original <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.i-p9.1"></span>Introductory Notice</span>:—

<span id="iii.i-p10"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iii.i-p10.1"></span>We</span> learn from several sources that Tatian
was an Assyrian, but know nothing very definite either as to the time or
place of his birth. Epiphanius (*Hær.*, xlvi.) declares that he was a
native of Mesopotamia; and we infer from other ascertained facts
regarding him, that he flourished about the middle of the second
century. He was at first an eager student of heathen literature, and
seems to have been especially devoted to researches in philosophy. But
he found no satisfaction in the bewildering mazes of Greek speculation,
while he became utterly disgusted with what heathenism presented to him
under the name of religion. In these circumstances, he happily met with
the sacred books of the Christians, and was powerfully attracted by the
purity of morals which these inculcated, and by the means of deliverance
from the bondage of sin which <span id="page_63">p. 63</span> <span
id="iii.i-Page_63"></span>they revealed. He seems to have embraced
Christianity at Rome, where he became acquainted with Justin Martyr, and
enjoyed the instructions of that eminent teacher of the Gospel. After
the death of Justin, Tatian unfortunately fell under the influence of
the Gnostic heresy, and founded an ascetic sect, which, from the rigid
principles it professed, was called that of the Encratites, that is,
“*The self-controlled*,” or, “*The masters of themselves*.” Tatian
latterly established himself at Antioch, and acquired a considerable
number of disciples, who continued after his death to be distinguished
by the practice of those austerities which he had enjoined. The sect of
the Encratites is supposed to have been established about <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.i-p10.2"></span>a.d.</span> 166, and Tatian
appears to have died some few years afterwards.

<span id="iii.i-p11"></span>The only extant work of Tatian is his
“Address to the Greeks.” It is a most unsparing and direct exposure of
the enormities of heathenism. Several other works are said to have been
composed by Tatian; and of these, a *Diatessaron*, or *Harmony of the
Four Gospels*, is specially mentioned. His Gnostic views led him to
exclude from the continuous narrative of our Lord’s life, given in this
work, all those passages which bear upon the incarnation and true
humanity of Christ. Not withstanding this defect, we cannot but regret
the loss of this earliest Gospel harmony; but the very title it bore is
important, as showing that the Four Gospels, and these only, were deemed
authoritative about the middle of the second century.
