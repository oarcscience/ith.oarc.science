##### <span id="vi.iii.i.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.—Men and Women Alike Under the Instructor’s Charge.

<span id="vi.iii.i.iv-p1"></span>Let us, then, embracing more and more
this good obedience, give ourselves to the Lord; clinging to what is
surest, the cable of faith in Him, and understanding that the virtue of
man and woman is the same. For if the God of both is one, the master of
both is also one; one church, one temperance, one modesty; their food is
common, marriage an equal yoke; respiration, sight, hearing, knowledge,
hope, obedience, love all alike. And those whose life is common, have
common graces and a common salvation; common to them are love and
training. “For in this world,” he says, “they marry, and are given in
marriage,” <span id="fr_1047"></span>[1048](#fn_1047.md) in which alone the
female is distinguished from the male; “but in that world it is so no
more.” There the rewards of this social and holy life, which is based on
conjugal union, are laid up, not for male and female, but for man, the
sexual desire which divides humanity being removed. Common therefore,
too, to men and women, is the name of man. For this reason I think the
Attics called, not boys only, but girls, <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iii.i.iv-p2.2"></span>παιδάριον</span>, using it as a word of
common gender; if Menander the comic poet, in *Rhapizomena,* appears to
any one a sufficient authority, who thus speaks:—

> <span id="vi.iii.i.iv-p2.3"></span> “My little daughter; for by
> nature  
> The child (<span class="Greek"><span
> id="vi.iii.i.iv-p2.6"></span>παιδάριον</span>) is most loving.  

<span id="vi.iii.i.iv-p3"></span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iii.i.iv-p3.1"></span>Ἄρνες</span>, too, the word for lambs, is a
common name of simplicity for the male and female animal.

<span id="vi.iii.i.iv-p4"></span>Now the Lord Himself will feed us as
His flock forever. Amen. But without a sheperd, neither <span
id="page_212">p. 212</span> <span id="vi.iii.i.iv-Page_212"></span>can
sheep nor any other animal live, nor children without a tutor, nor
domestics without a master.”
