##### <span id="vi.iv.ii.x-p0.1"></span>Chapter X.—To What the Philosopher Applies Himself.

<span id="vi.iv.ii.x-p1"></span>These three things, therefore, our
philosopher attaches himself to: first, speculation; second, the
performance of the precepts; third, the forming of good men;—which,
concurring, form the Gnostic. Whichever of these is wanting, the
elements of knowledge limp. Whence the Scripture divinely says, “And the
Lord spake to Moses, saying, Speak to the children of Israel, and thou
shalt say to them, I am the <span class="sc"><span
id="vi.iv.ii.x-p1.1"></span>Lord</span> your God. According to the
customs of the land of Egypt, in which ye have dwelt, ye shall not do;
and according to the customs of Canaan, into which I bring you, ye shall
not do; and in their usages ye shall not walk. Ye shall perform My
judgments, and keep My precepts, and walk in them: I am the <span
class="sc"><span id="vi.iv.ii.x-p1.2"></span>Lord</span> your God. And
ye shall keep all My commandments, and do them. He that doeth them shall
live in them. I am the <span class="sc"><span
id="vi.iv.ii.x-p1.3"></span>Lord</span> your God.” <span
id="fr_2255"></span>[2256](#fn_2255.md) Whether, then, Egypt and the land
of Canaan be the symbol of the world and of deceit, or of sufferings and
afflictions; the oracle shows us what must be abstained from, and what,
being divine and not worldly, must be observed. And when it is said,
“The man that doeth them shall live in them,” <span
id="fr_2256"></span>[2257](#fn_2256.md) it declares both the correction of
the Hebrews themselves, and the training and advancement of us who are
nigh: <span id="fr_2257"></span>[2258](#fn_2257.md) it declares at once
their life and ours. For “those who were dead in sins are quickened
together with Christ,” <span id="fr_2258"></span>[2259](#fn_2258.md) by our
covenant. For Scripture, by the frequent reiteration of the expression,
“I am the <span class="sc"><span id="vi.iv.ii.x-p5.2"></span>Lord</span>
your God,” shames in such a way as most powerfully to dissuade, by
teaching us to follow God who gave the commandments, and gently
admonishes us to seek God and endeavour to know Him as far as possible;
which is the highest speculation, that which scans the greatest
mysteries, the real knowledge, that which becomes irrefragable by
reason. This alone is the knowledge of wisdom, from which rectitude of
conduct is never disjoined.
