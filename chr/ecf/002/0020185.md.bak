##### <span id="v.ii.xv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XV.—The Christians Distinguish God from Matter.

<span id="v.ii.xv-p1"></span>But grant that they acknowledge the same.
What then? Because the multitude, who cannot distinguish between matter
and God, or see how great is the interval which lies between them, pray
to idols made of matter, are we therefore, who do distinguish and
separate the uncreated and the created, that which is and that which is
not, that which is apprehended by the understanding and that which is
perceived by the senses, and who give the fitting name to each of
them,—are we to come and worship images? If, indeed, matter and God are
the same, two names for one thing, then certainly, in not regarding
stocks and stones, gold and silver, as gods, we are guilty of impiety.
But if they are at the greatest possible remove from one another—as far
asunder as the artist and the materials of his art—why are we called to
account? For as is the potter and the clay (matter being the clay, and
the artist the potter), so is God, the Framer of the world, and matter,
which is subservient to Him for the purposes of His art. <span
id="fr_740"></span>[741](#fn_740.md) But as the clay cannot become vessels
of itself without art, so neither did matter, which is capable of taking
all forms, receive, apart from God the Framer, distinction and shape and
order. And as we do not hold the pottery of more worth than him who made
it, nor the vessels of glass and gold than him who wrought them; but if
there is anything about them elegant in art we praise the artificer, and
it is he who reaps the glory of the vessels: even so with matter and
God—the glory and honour of the orderly arrangement of the world belongs
of right not to matter, but to God, the Framer of matter. So that, if we
were to regard the various forms of matter as gods, we should seem to be
without any sense of the true God, because we should be putting the
things which are dissoluble and perishable on a level with that which is
eternal.
