<span id="vi.iv.vi.xiii"></span>

##### <span id="vi.iv.vi.xiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIII.—Degrees of Glory in Heaven Corresponding with the Dignities of the Church Below.

<span id="vi.iv.vi.xiii-p1"></span>He, then, who has first moderated his
passions and trained himself for impassibility, and developed to the
beneficence of gnostic perfection, is here equal to the angels. Luminous
already, and like the sun shining in the exercise of beneficence, he
speeds by righteous knowledge through the love of God to the sacred
abode, like as the apostles. Not that they became apostles through being
chosen for some distinguished peculiarity <span
id="fr_3378"></span>[3379](#fn_3378) of nature, since also Judas was
chosen along with them. But they were capable of becoming apostles on
being chosen by Him who foresees even ultimate issues. Matthias,
accordingly, who was not chosen along with them, on showing himself
worthy of becoming an apostle, is substituted for Judas.

<span id="vi.iv.vi.xiii-p3"></span>Those, then, also now, who have
exercised themselves in the Lord’s commandments, and lived perfectly and
gnostically according to the Gospel, may be enrolled in the chosen body
of the apostles. Such an one is in reality a presbyter of the Church,
and a true minister (deacon) of the will of God, if he do and teach what
is the Lord’s; not as being ordained <span
id="fr_3379"></span>[3380](#fn_3379) by men, nor regarded righteous
because a presbyter, but enrolled in the presbyterate <span
id="fr_3380"></span>[3381](#fn_3380) because righteous. And although
here upon earth he be not honoured with the chief seat, <span
id="fr_3381"></span>[3382](#fn_3381) he will sit down on the
four-and-twenty thrones, <span id="fr_3382"></span>[3383](#fn_3382)
judging the people, as John says in the Apocalypse.

<span id="vi.iv.vi.xiii-p8"></span>For, in truth, the covenant of
salvation, reaching down to us from the foundation of the world, through
different generations and times, is one, though conceived as different
in respect of gift. For it follows that there is one unchangeable gift
of salvation given by one God, through one Lord, benefiting in many
ways. For which cause the middle wall <span
id="fr_3383"></span>[3384](#fn_3383) which separated the Greek from the
Jew is taken away, in order that there might be a peculiar people. And
so both meet in the one unity of faith; and the selection out of both is
one. And the chosen of the chosen are those who by reason of perfect
knowledge are called \[as the best\] from the <span id="page_505">p.
505</span> <span id="vi.iv.vi.xiii-Page_505"></span>Church itself, and
honoured with the most august glory—the judges and
rulers—four-and-twenty (the grace being doubled) equally from Jews and
Greeks. Since, according to my opinion, the grades <span
id="fr_3384"></span>[3385](#fn_3384) here in the Church, of bishops,
presbyters, deacons, are imitations of the angelic glory, and of that
economy which, the Scriptures say, awaits those who, following the
footsteps of the apostles, have lived in perfection of righteousness
according to the Gospel. For these taken up in the clouds, the
apostle <span id="fr_3385"></span>[3386](#fn_3385) writes, will first
minister \[as deacons\], then be classed in the presbyterate, by
promotion in glory (for glory differs <span
id="fr_3386"></span>[3387](#fn_3386) from glory) till they grow into “a
perfect man.” <span id="fr_3387"></span>[3388](#fn_3387)
