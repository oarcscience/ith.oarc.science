##### <span id="iii.ii.xv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XV.—Necessity of a Union with the Holy Spirit.

<span id="iii.ii.xv-p1"></span>But further, it becomes us now to seek
for what we once had, but have lost, to unite the soul with the Holy
Spirit, and to strive after union with God. The human soul consists of
many parts, and is not simple; it is composite, so as to manifest itself
through the body; for neither could it ever appear by itself without the
body, nor does the flesh rise again without the soul. Man is not, as the
croaking philosophers say, merely a rational animal, capable of
understanding and knowledge; for, according to them, even irrational
creatures appear possessed of understanding and knowledge. But man alone
is the image and likeness of God; and I mean by man, not one who
performs actions similar to those of animals, but one who has advanced
far beyond mere humanity—to God Himself. This question we have discussed
more minutely in the treatise concerning animals. But the principal
point to be spoken of now is, what is intended by the image and likeness
of God. That which cannot be compared is no other than abstract being;
but that which is compared is no other than that which is like. The
perfect God is without flesh; but man is flesh. The bond of the flesh is
the soul; <span id="fr_465"></span>[466](#fn_465.md) that which encloses
the soul is the flesh. Such is the nature of man’s constitution; and, if
it be like a temple, God is pleased to dwell in it by the spirit, His
representative; but, if it be not such a habitation, man excels the wild
beasts in articulate language only,—in other respects his manner of life
is like theirs, as one who is not a likeness of God. But none of the
demons possess flesh; their structure is spiritual, like that of fire or
air. And only by those whom the Spirit of God dwells in and fortifies
are the bodies of the demons easily seen, not at all by others,—I mean
those who possess only soul; <span id="fr_466"></span>[467](#fn_466.md) for
the inferior has not the ability to apprehend the superior. On this
account the nature of the demons has no place for repentance; for they
are the reflection of matter and of wickedness. But matter desired to
exercise lordship over the soul; and according to their free-will these
gave laws of death to men; but men, after the loss of immortality, have
conquered death by submitting to death in faith; <span
id="fr_467"></span>[468](#fn_467.md) and by repentance a call has been
given to them, according to the word which says, “Since they were made a
little lower than the angels.” <span id="fr_468"></span>[469](#fn_468.md)
And, <span id="page_72">p. 72</span> <span
id="iii.ii.xv-Page_72"></span>for every one who has been conquered, it
is possible again to conquer, if he rejects the condition which brings
death. And what that is, may be easily seen by men who long for
immortality.
