#### <span id="ii.iv.vii-p0.1"></span>Similitude Seventh.

##### <span id="ii.iv.vii-p0.2"></span>They Who Repent Must Bring Forth Fruits Worthy of Repentance.

<span id="ii.iv.vii-p1"></span>After a few days I saw him in the same
plain where I had also seen the shepherds; and he said to me, “What do
you wish with me?” I said to him, “Sir, that you would order the
shepherd who punishes to depart out of my house, because he afflicts me
exceedingly.” “It is necessary,” he replied, “that you be afflicted; for
thus,” he continued, “did the glorious angel command concerning you, as
he wishes you to be tried.” “What have I done which is so bad, sir,” I
replied, “that I should be delivered over to this angel?” “Listen,” he
said: “Your sins are many, but not so great as to require that *you* be
delivered over to this angel; but your household has committed great
iniquities and sins, and the glorious angel has been incensed at them on
account of their deeds; and for this reason he commanded you to be
afflicted for a certain time, that they also might repent, and purify
themselves from every desire of this world. When, therefore, they repent
and are purified, then the angel of punishment will depart.” I said to
him, “Sir, if they have done such things as to incense the glorious
angel against them, yet what have I done?” He replied, “They cannot be
afflicted at all, unless you, the head of the house, be afflicted: for
when you are afflicted, of necessity they also suffer affliction; but if
you are in comfort, they can feel no affliction.” “Well, sir,” I said,
“they have repented with their whole heart.” “I know, too,” he answered,
“that they have repented with their whole heart: do you think, however,
that the sins of those who repent are remitted? <span
id="fr_304"></span>[305](#fn_304) Not altogether, but he who repents
must torture his own soul, and be exceedingly humble in all his conduct,
and be afflicted with many kinds of affliction; and if he endure the
afflictions that come upon him, He who created all things, and endued
them with power, will assuredly have compassion, and will heal him; and
this will He do when He sees the heart <span id="page_39">p. 39</span>
<span id="ii.iv.vii-Page_39"></span>of every penitent pure from every
evil thing: <span id="fr_305"></span>[306](#fn_305) and it is profitable
for you and for your house to suffer affliction now. But why should I
say much to you? You must be afflicted, as that angel of the Lord
commanded who delivered you to me. And for this give thanks to the Lord,
because He has deemed you worthy of showing you beforehand this
affliction, that, knowing it before it comes, you may be able to bear it
with courage.” <span id="fr_306"></span>[307](#fn_306) I said to him,
“Sir, be thou with me, and I will be able to bear all affliction.” “I
will be with you,” he said, “and I will ask the angel of punishment to
afflict you more lightly; nevertheless, you will be afflicted for a
little time, and again you will be re-established in your house. Only
continue humble, and serve the Lord in all purity of heart, you and your
children, and your house, and walk in my commands which I enjoin upon
you, and your repentance will be deep and pure; and if you observe these
things with your household, every affliction will depart from you. <span
id="fr_307"></span>[308](#fn_307) And affliction,” he added, “will
depart from all who walk in these my commandments.”

<span id="ii.iv.vii-p2"></span> The Vat. and Pal. have *protinus*,
“immediately.” \[Wake adopts this reading, which appears to be required
by the context.\]

<span id="ii.iv.vii-p3"></span> The Lips. has lost here a few words,
which are supplied from the Latin translations. \[[Mal. iii.
3](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#003)<span id="ii.iv.vii-p3.1"></span>;
[Isa. i. 22](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#022)<span

cxxxix. 23, 24. Is there not much teaching here for our easy living, and
light ideas of the sinfulness of sin?\]

<span id="ii.iv.vii-p4"></span> The Vatican has: “But rather give thanks
to the Lord, that He, knowing what is to come to pass, has deemed you
worthy to tell you beforehand that affiction is coming upon those who
are able to bear it.” \[[1 Cor. x.
13](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#013)<span id="ii.iv.vii-p4.1"></span>.
But the whole argument turns on [Jas. i.
2](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#002)<span id="ii.iv.vii-p4.2"></span>, as
Hermas delights in this practical apostle.\]
