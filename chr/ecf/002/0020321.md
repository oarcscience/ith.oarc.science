##### <span id="vi.iv.i.xxviii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXVIII.—The Fourfold Division of the Mosaic Law.

<span id="vi.iv.i.xxviii-p1"></span>The Mosaic philosophy is accordingly
divided into four parts,—into the historic, and that which is specially
called the legislative, which two properly belong to an ethical
treatise; and the third, that which relates to sacrifice, which belongs
to physical science; and the fourth, above all, the department of
theology, “vision,” <span id="fr_2129"></span>[2130](#fn_2129) which
Plato predicates of the truly great mysteries. And this species
Aristotle calls metaphysics. Dialectics, according to Plato, is, as he
says in *The Statesman*, a science devoted to the discovery of the
explanation of things. And it is to be acquired by the wise man, not for
the sake of saying or doing aught of what we find among men (as the
dialecticians, who occupy themselves in sophistry, do), but to be able
to say and do, as far as possible, what is pleasing to God. But the true
dialectic, being philosophy mixed with truth, by examining things, and
testing forces and powers, gradually ascends in relation to the most
excellent essence of all, and essays to go beyond to the God of the
universe, professing not the knowledge of mortal affairs, but the
science of things divine and heavenly; in accordance with which follows
a suitable course of practice with respect to words and deeds, even in
human affairs. Rightly, therefore, the Scripture, in its desire to make
us such dialecticians, exhorts us: “Be ye skilful money-changers” <span
id="fr_2130"></span>[2131](#fn_2130) rejecting some things, but
retaining what is good. For this true dialectic is the science which
analyses the objects of thought, and shows abstractly and by itself the
individual substratum of existences, or the power of dividing things
into genera, which descends to their most special properties, and
presents each individual object to be contemplated simply such as it is.

<span id="vi.iv.i.xxviii-p4"></span>Wherefore it alone conducts to the
true wisdom, which is the divine power which deals with the knowledge of
entities as entities, which grasps what is perfect, and is freed from
all passion; not without the Saviour, who withdraws, by the divine word,
the gloom of ignorance <span id="page_341">p. 341</span> <span
id="vi.iv.i.xxviii-Page_341"></span>arising from evil training, which
had overspread the eye of the soul, and bestows the best of gifts,—

> <span id="vi.iv.i.xxviii-p4.1"></span> “That we might well know or God
> or man.” <span id="fr_2131"></span>[2132](#fn_2131)  

<span id="vi.iv.i.xxviii-p6"></span>It is He who truly shows how we are
to know ourselves. It is He who reveals the Father of the universe to
whom He wills, and as far as human nature can comprehend. “For no man
knoweth the Son but the Father, nor the Father but the Son, and he to
whom the Son shall reveal Him.” <span
id="fr_2132"></span>[2133](#fn_2132) Rightly, then, the apostle says
that it was by revelation that he knew the mystery: “As I wrote afore in
few words, according as ye are able to understand my knowledge in the
mystery of Christ.” <span id="fr_2133"></span>[2134](#fn_2133)
“According as ye are able,” he said, since he knew that some had
received milk only, and had not yet received meat, nor even milk simply.
The sense of the law is to be taken in three ways, <span
id="fr_2134"></span>[2135](#fn_2134) —either as exhibiting a symbol, or
laying down a precept for right conduct, or as uttering a prophecy. But
I well know that it belongs to men \[of full age\] to distinguish and
declare these things. For the whole Scripture is not in its meaning a
single Myconos, as the proverbial expression has it; but those who hunt
after the connection of the divine teaching, must approach it with the
utmost perfection of the logical faculty.

which is wanting. The author asserts the triple sense of Scripture,—the
mystic, the moral, and the prophetic. \[And thus lays the egg which his
pupil Origen was to hatch, and to nurse into a brood of mysticism.\]
