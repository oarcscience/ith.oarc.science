##### <span id="iv.ii.ii.xxxv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXV.—Precepts from the Prophetic Books.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xxxv-p1"></span>The divine law, then, not only
forbids the worshipping of idols, but also of the heavenly bodies, the
sun, the moon, or the other stars; yea, not heaven, nor earth, nor the
sea, nor fountains, nor rivers, must be worshipped, but we must serve in
holiness of heart and sincerity of purpose only the living and true God,
who also is Maker of the universe. Wherefore saith the holy law: “Thou
shalt not commit adultery; thou shalt not steal; thou shalt not bear
false witness; thou shalt not desire thy neighbour’s wife.” So also the
prophets. Solomon indeed teaches us that we must not sin with so much as
a turn of the eye, <span id="fr_618"></span>[619](#fn_618.md) saying, “Let
thine eyes look right on, and let thy eyelids look straight before
thee.” <span id="fr_619"></span>[620](#fn_619.md) And Moses, who himself
also was a prophet, says, concerning the sole government of God: “Your
God is He who establishes the heaven, and forms the earth, whose hands
have brought forth all the host of heaven; and He has not set these
things before you that you should go after them.” <span
id="fr_620"></span>[621](#fn_620.md) And Isaiah himself also says: “Thus
saith the <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.ii.ii.xxxv-p4.2"></span>Lord</span> God who established the
heavens, and founded the earth and all that is therein, and giveth
breath unto the people upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein.
This is the <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.ii.ii.xxxv-p4.3"></span>Lord</span> your God.” <span
id="fr_621"></span>[622](#fn_621.md) And again, through him He says: “I
have made the earth, and man upon it. I by my hand have established the
heavens.” <span id="fr_622"></span>[623](#fn_622.md) And in another
chapter, “This is your God, who created the ends of the earth; He
hungereth not, neither is weary, and there is no searching of His
understanding.” <span id="fr_623"></span>[624](#fn_623.md) So, too,
Jeremiah says: “Who hath made the earth by His power, and established
the world by His wisdom, and by His discretion hath stretched out the
heavens, and a mass of water in the heavens, and He caused the clouds to
ascend from the ends of the earth; He made lightnings with rain, and
brought forth winds out of His treasures.” <span
id="fr_624"></span>[625](#fn_624.md) One can see how consistently and
harmoniously all the prophets spoke, having given utterance through one
and the same spirit concerning the unity of God, and the creation of the
world, and the formation of man. Moreover, they were in sore travail,
bewailing the godless race of men, and they reproached those, who seemed
to be wise, for their error and hardness of heart. Jeremiah, indeed,
said: “Every man is brutishly gone astray from the knowledge of Him;
every founder is confounded by his graven images; in vain the
silversmith makes his molten images; there is no breath in them: in the
day of their visitation they shall perish.” <span
id="fr_625"></span>[626](#fn_625.md) The same, too, says David: “They are
corrupt, they have done abominable works; there is none that doeth good,
no, not one; they have all gone aside, they have together become
profitless.” <span id="fr_626"></span>[627](#fn_626.md) So also Habakkuk:
“What profiteth the graven image that he has graven it a lying image?
Woe to him that saith to the stone, Awake; and to the wood,
Arise.” <span id="fr_627"></span>[628](#fn_627.md) Likewise spoke the other
prophets of the truth. And why should I recount the multitude of
prophets, who are numerous, and said ten thousand things consistently
and harmoniously? For those who desire it, can, by reading what they
uttered, accurately understand the truth, and no longer be carried away
by opinion and profitless labour. These, then, whom we have already
mentioned, were prophets among the Hebrews,—illiterate, and shepherds,
and uneducated.
