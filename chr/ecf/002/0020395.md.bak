<span id="vi.iv.vi.v"></span>

##### <span id="vi.iv.vi.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.—The Greeks Had Some Knowledge of the True God.

<span id="vi.iv.vi.v-p1"></span>And that the men of highest repute among
the Greeks knew God, not by positive knowledge, but by indirect
expression, <span id="fr_3252"></span>[3253](#fn_3252.md) Peter says in the
*Preaching:* “Know then that there is one God, who made the beginning of
all things, and holds the power of the end; and is the Invisible, who
sees all things; incapable of being contained, who contains all things;
needing nothing, whom all things need, and by whom they are;
incomprehensible, everlasting, unmade, who made all things by the ‘Word
of His power,’ that is, according to the gnostic scripture, His
Son.” <span id="fr_3253"></span>[3254](#fn_3253.md)

<span id="vi.iv.vi.v-p4"></span>Then he adds: “Worship this God not as
the Greeks,”—signifying plainly, that the excellent among the Greeks
worshipped the same God as we, but that they had not learned by perfect
knowledge that which was delivered by the Son. “Do not then worship,” he
did not say, the God whom the Greeks worship, but “as the
Greeks,”—changing the manner of the worship of God, not announcing
another God. What, then, the expression “not as the Greeks” means, Peter
himself shall explain, as he adds: “Since they are carried away by
ignorance, and know not God” (as we do, according to the perfect
knowledge); “but giving shape to the things <span
id="fr_3254"></span>[3255](#fn_3254.md) of which He gave them the power for
use—stocks and stones, brass and iron, gold and silver—matter;—and
setting up the things which are slaves for use and possession, worship
them. <span id="fr_3255"></span>[3256](#fn_3255.md) And what God hath given
to them for food—the fowls of the air, and the fish of the sea, and the
creeping things of the earth, and the wild beasts with the four-footed
cattle of the field, weasels and mice, cats and dogs and apes, and their
own proper food—they sacrifice as sacrifices to mortals; and offering
dead things to the dead, as to gods, are unthankful to God, denying His
existence by these things.” And that it is said, that we and the Greeks
know the same God, though not in the same way, he will infer thus:
“Neither worship as the Jews; for they, thinking that they only know
God, do not know Him, adoring as they do angels and archangels, the
month and the moon. And if the moon be not visible, they do not hold the
Sabbath, which is called the first; <span
id="fr_3256"></span>[3257](#fn_3256.md) nor do they hold the new moon, nor
the feast of unleavened bread, nor the feast, nor the great day.” <span
id="fr_3257"></span>[3258](#fn_3257.md) Then he gives the finishing stroke
to the question: “So that do ye also, learning holily and righteously
what we deliver to you; keep them, worshipping God in a new way, by
Christ.” For we find in the Scriptures, as the Lord says: “Behold, I
make with you a new covenant, not as I made with your fathers in Mount
Horeb.” <span id="fr_3258"></span>[3259](#fn_3258.md) He made a new
covenant with us; for what belonged to the Greeks and Jews is old. But
we, who worship Him in a new way, in the third form, are Christians. For
clearly, as I think, he showed that the one and only God was known by
the Greeks in a Gentile way, by the Jews Judaically, and in a new and
spiritual way by us.

<span id="vi.iv.vi.v-p10"></span>And further, that the same God that
furnished both the Covenants was the giver of Greek philosophy to the
Greeks, by which the Almighty is glorified among the Greeks, he shows.
And it is clear from this. Accordingly, then, from the <span
id="page_490">p. 490</span> <span
id="vi.iv.vi.v-Page_490"></span>Hellenic training, and also from that of
the law are gathered into the one race of the saved people those who
accept faith: not that the three peoples are separated by time, so that
one might suppose three natures, but trained in different Covenants of
the one Lord, by the word of the one Lord. For that, as God wished to
save the Jews by giving to them prophets, so also by raising up prophets
of their own in their own tongue, as they were able to receive God’s
beneficence, He distinguished the most excellent of the Greeks from the
common herd, in addition to “*Peter’s Preaching*,” the Apostle Paul will
show, saying: “Take also the Hellenic books, read the Sibyl, how it is
shown that God is one, and how the future is indicated. And taking
Hystaspes, read, and you will find much more luminously and distinctly
the Son of God described, and how many kings shall draw up their forces
against Christ, hating Him and those that bear His name, and His
faithful ones, and His patience, and His coming.” Then in one word he
asks us, “Whose is the world, and all that is in the world? Are they not
God’s?” <span id="fr_3259"></span>[3260](#fn_3259.md) Wherefore Peter says,
that the Lord said to the apostles: “If any one of Israel then, wishes
to repent, and by my name to believe in God, his sins shall be forgiven
him, after twelve years. Go forth into the world, that no one may say,
We have not heard.”

*Stromata*, i. 19, p. 322, *ante*, Potter p. 372; also v. 14, p. 465,
*ante*, Potter p. 730,—in all of which Lowth adopts <span

true reading, instead of <span class="Greek"><span

passages, Clement instances as one of the circumlocutions or roundabout
expressions by which God was known to the Greek poets and philosophers,
“*The Unknown God*.” Joannes Clericus proposes to read <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.iv.vi.v-p2.3"></span>παράφασιν</span>
(*palpitatio*), touching, feeling after. \[See *Strom*., p. 321, and p.
