### <span id="vi.v.i-p0.1"></span>Elucidations

##### <span id="vi.v.i-p0.2"></span>I.

<span id="vi.v.i-p1"></span>(Note 1, p. 591.)

<span id="vi.v.i-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="vi.v.i-p2.1"></span>The</span> kingdom of Christ was set up in great
weakness, that nothing might be wanting to the glory of His working by
the Spirit, in its triumph over the darkness of the world. “Not many
wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble,” were
called. <span id="fr_3922"></span>[3923](#fn_3922.md) And so it continued
for a long time. Under Commodus, however (<span class="sc"><span
id="vi.v.i-p3.2"></span>a.d.</span> 180–192), a temporary respite was
conceded; partly because his favourite Marcia took their part for some
reason, and partly because his cruelty gratified itself in another
direction. “Our circumstances,” says Eusebius, “were changed to a milder
aspect; as there was peace prevailing, by the grace of God, throughout
the world in the churches. Then, also, the saving-doctrine brought the
minds of men to a devout veneration of the Supreme God, from every race
on earth, so that, now, many of those *eminent at Rome for their wealth
and kindred, with their whole house and family*, yielded themselves to
salvation.” What happened near the court of a fickle tyrant was far more
likely to be common in Antioch and Alexandria. Men’s consciences had no
doubt been with the Christians, as Pilate’s was with their Master; and
now, when it became less perilous, they began to laugh at idols, and
even to enroll themselves with Christians. Some, no doubt, like Joseph
and Nicodemus, gave themselves to the Lord; but others, “with a form of
godliness, denied the power thereof.” Clement detected the great evil
that began to threaten, and this beautiful tract is the product of his
watchful observation. For he was gifted, also, with that great
characteristic of noble mind, a faculty of foreseeing “whereunto such
things must grow.” His love and solicitude for the Church, lest its
simplicity should pass away with its poverty, dictated this solemn and
most timely warning.

<span id="vi.v.i-p4"></span>And it is worthy of grateful remark, how
admirably sustained was this primitive spirit among all the early
witnesses for truth. They were not of this world, and they dreaded its
influence. How richly the Word dwelt in them, is manifest from their
amazing familiarity with the Scriptures. <span id="page_605">p.
605</span> <span id="vi.v.i-Page_605"></span>That they sometimes
misquote or confuse quotations, or mix a Scriptural saying with some
current proverb or an apocryphal gloss, is surely not surprising, when
copies of the Scriptures were few and costly, when no concordances and
books of reference were at hand, and when their whole apparatus for
Biblical study was so extremely incomplete.

<span id="vi.v.i-p5"></span>To the genius of this great Alexandrian
Father, we are all debtors to this day. Had he not, unfortunately,
allied much of his wisdom with the hateful name of the *Gnostic*, <span
id="fr_3923"></span>[3924](#fn_3923.md) which he failed to wrest from the
pseudo-Gnostics, with whom it is irrevocably associated, we may be sure
his expositions of Christian philosophy would be more useful in our
times.

##### <span id="vi.v.i-p6.1"></span>II.

<span id="vi.v.i-p7"></span>(Segaar, note 3, p. 594.)

<span id="vi.v.i-p8"></span>Charles Segaar, S.T.D., born in 1724, was
Greek professor at Utrecht, from 1766 to 1803, after filling several
important and laborious positions as a pastor and preacher. He died Dec.
22, 1803. He has left a great reputation as “the most theological of
philologists, and the most philological of theologians.” Had he gone
over the entire text of Clement, and edited all his works, with the care
and ability displayed in his critical edition of the <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.v.i-p8.1"></span>Τίς ὁ σωζόμενος
πλούσιος</span>, the world would have been greatly enriched by his
influence on the cultivation of patristic literature. In his eloquent
preface to this tract, he bewails the neglect into which that
fundamental department of Christian learning had fallen; praising the
labours of Anglican scholars, who, in the former century, had devoted
themselves to the production of valuable editions of the Fathers. He
speaks of himself as from early years inflamed with a singular love of
such studies and especially of the Greek Fathers, and adds an expression
of the extreme gratification with which he had read and pondered the
*Quis dives Salvandus*, among the admirable works of Clement of
Alexandria. He corrects Ghisler’s error in crediting it to Origen
(edition of 1623), and reminds us that there is but a single <span
class="sc"><span id="vi.v.i-p8.2"></span>ms.</span> from which it is
derived, viz., that of the Vatican.

<span id="vi.v.i-p9"></span>Apart from the value of Segaar’s
annotations, his work is very useful to Greek scholars, for its varied
erudition, much wealth of his learning being expended upon single words
and their idiomatic uses. The sort of work devoted to this tract is
precisely what I covet for my countrymen; and I look forward with hope
to the day as not remote, when from regions now unnamed, in this vast
domain of our republican America, critical editions of all of the
*Ante-Nicene Fathers* shall be given to the republic of letters, with a
beauty of typography hitherto unknown. The valuable *Patrologia* of
Migne might well be made the base of a Phœnix-like edition of the same
series. It was only fit for such a base; for its print and paper are
disgraceful, and the inaccuracy and carelessness of its references and
editorial work are only pardonable when one reflects on the small cost
at which it was afforded. The plates have perished in flames; but the
restoration of the whole work is worthy of the ambition of American
scholars, and of the patronage of wealth now sordid but capable of being
ennobled by being made useful to mankind.

##### <span id="vi.v.i-p9.1"></span>III.

<span id="vi.v.i-p10"></span>(Willing Souls, cap. xxi. p. 597.)

<span id="vi.v.i-p11"></span>On the subject of free-will, so profusely
illustrated by Clement, I have foreborne to add any comments. But
Segaar’s *Excursus* (iv. p. 410) is worthy of being consulted. On
Clement’s ideas of *Hades* and the *intermediate state*, I have made no
comment; but Segaar’s endeavour to state judicially the view of our
author (*Excursus*, x. p. 421), though in some particulars it seems to
me unsatisfactory, is also worthy of examination.

<span id="vi.v.i-p12"></span>If a number of other important points have
been apparently overlooked in my Elucidations, it is because I fear I
have already gone beyond the conditions and limitations of my work.

Why not use the Latin word Perfector? The idea is not simply perfectus:
Clement’s *Gnostic* is a *gnomon*, actively indexing the mind of Christ.
