##### <span id="vi.iv.i.xiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIII.—All Sects of Philosophy Contain a Germ of Truth.

<span id="vi.iv.i.xiii-p1"></span>Since, therefore, truth is one (for
falsehood has ten thousand by-paths); just as the Bacchantes tore
asunder the limbs of Pentheus, so the sects both of barbarian and
Hellenic philosophy have done with truth, and each vaunts as the whole
truth the portion which has fallen to its lot. But all, in my
opinion, <span id="fr_1944"></span>[1945](#fn_1944) are illuminated by
the dawn of Light. <span id="fr_1945"></span>[1946](#fn_1945) Let all,
therefore, both Greeks and barbarians, who have aspired after the
truth,—both those who possess not a little, and those who have any
portion,—produce whatever they have of the word of truth.

<span id="vi.iv.i.xiii-p4"></span>Eternity, for instance, presents in an
instant the future and the present, also the past of time. But truth,
much more powerful than limitless duration, can collect its proper
germs, though they have fallen on foreign soil. For we shall find that
very many of the dogmas that are held by such sects as have not become
utterly senseless, and are not cut out from the order of nature (by
cutting off Christ, as the women of the fable dismembered the
man), <span id="fr_1946"></span>[1947](#fn_1946) though appearing unlike
one another, correspond in their origin and with the truth as a whole.
For they coincide in one, either as a part, or a species, or a genus.
For instance, though the highest note is different from the lowest note,
yet both compose one harmony. And in numbers an even number differs from
an odd number; but both suit in arithmetic; as also is the case with
figure, the circle, and the triangle, and the square, and whatever
figures differ from one another. Also, in the whole universe, all the
parts, though differing one from another, preserve their relation to the
whole. So, then, the barbarian and Hellenic philosophy has torn off a
fragment of eternal truth not from the mythology of Dionysus, but from
the theology of the ever-living Word. And He who brings again together
the separate fragments, and makes them one, will without peril, be
assured, contemplate the perfect Word, the truth. Therefore it is
written in Ecclesiastes: “And I added wisdom above all who were before
me in Jerusalem; and my heart saw many things; and besides, I knew
wisdom and knowledge, parables and understanding. And this also is the
choice of the spirit, because in abundance of wisdom is abundance of
knowledge.” <span id="fr_1947"></span>[1948](#fn_1947) He who is
conversant with all kinds of wisdom, will be pre-eminently a
gnostic. <span id="fr_1948"></span>[1949](#fn_1948) Now it is written,
“Abundance of the knowledge of wisdom will give life to him who is of
it.” <span id="fr_1949"></span>[1950](#fn_1949) And again, what is said
is confirmed more clearly by this saying, “All things are in the sight
of those who understand”—all things, both Hellenic and barbarian; but
the one or the other is not all. “They are right to those who wish to
receive understanding. Choose instruction, and not silver, and knowledge
above tested gold,” and prefer also sense to pure gold; “for wisdom is
better than precious stones, and no precious thing is worth it.” <span
id="fr_1950"></span>[1951](#fn_1950)

women exclude the man;” i.e., all males.
