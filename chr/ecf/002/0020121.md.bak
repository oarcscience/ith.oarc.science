##### <span id="iv.ii.ii.xxiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXIII.—The Truth of the Account in Genesis.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xxiii-p1"></span>Man, therefore, God made on the
sixth day, and made known this creation after the seventh day, when also
He made Paradise, that he might be in a better and distinctly superior
place. And that this is true, the fact itself proves. For how can one
miss seeing that the pains which women suffer in childbed, and the
oblivion of their labours which they afterwards enjoy, are sent in order
that the word of God may be fulfilled, and that the race of men may
increase and multiply? <span id="fr_597"></span>[598](#fn_597.md) And do we
not see also the judgment of the serpent,—how hatefully he crawls on his
belly and eats the dust,—that we may have this, too, for a proof of the
things which were said aforetime?

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xxiii-p2"></span> The Benedictine editor remarks:
“Women bring forth with labour and pain as the punishment awarded to
sin: they forget the pain, that the propagation of the race may not be
hindered.”
