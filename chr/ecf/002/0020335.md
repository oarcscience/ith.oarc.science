<span id="vi.iv.ii.xi"></span>

##### <span id="vi.iv.ii.xi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XI.—The Knowledge Which Comes Through Faith the Surest of All.

<span id="vi.iv.ii.xi-p1"></span>But the knowledge of those who think
themselves wise, whether the barbarian sects or the philosophers among
the Greeks, according to the apostle, “puffeth up.” <span
id="fr_2259"></span>[2260](#fn_2259.md) But that knowledge, which is the
scientific demonstration of what is delivered according to the true
philosophy, is founded on faith. Now, we may say that it is that process
of reason which, from what is admitted, procures faith in what is
disputed. Now, faith being twofold—the faith of knowledge and that of
opinion—nothing prevents us from calling demonstration twofold, the one
resting on knowledge, the other on opinion; since also knowledge and
foreknowledge are designated as twofold, that which is essentially
accurate, that which is defective. And is not the demonstration, which
we possess, that alone which is true, as being supplied out of the
divine Scriptures, the sacred writings, and out of the “God-taught
wisdom,” according to the apostle? Learning, then, is also obedience to
the commandments, which is faith in God. And faith is a power of God,
being the strength of the truth. For example, it is said, “If ye have
faith as a grain of mustard, ye shall remove the mountain.” <span
id="fr_2260"></span>[2261](#fn_2260.md) And again, “According to thy faith
let it be to thee.” <span id="fr_2261"></span>[2262](#fn_2261.md) And one
is cured, receiving healing by faith; and the dead is raised up in
consequence of the power of one believing that he would be raised. The
demonstration, however, which rests on opinion is human, and is the
result of rhetorical arguments or dialectic syllogisms. For the highest
demonstration, to which we have alluded, produces intelligent faith by
the adducing and opening up of the Scriptures <span id="page_359">p.
359</span> <span id="vi.iv.ii.xi-Page_359"></span>to the souls of those
who desire to learn; the result of which is knowledge (*gnosis*). For if
what is adduced in order to prove the point at issue is assumed to be
true, as being divine and prophetic, manifestly the conclusion arrived
at by inference from it will consequently be inferred truly; and the
legitimate result of the demonstration will be knowledge. When, then,
the memorial of the celestial and divine food was commanded to be
consecrated in the golden pot, it was said, “The omer was the tenth of
the three measures.” <span id="fr_2262"></span>[2263](#fn_2262.md) For in
ourselves, by the three measures are indicated three criteria; sensation
of objects of sense, speech,—of spoken names and words, and the mind,—of
intellectual objects. The Gnostic, therefore, will abstain from errors
in speech, and thought, and sensation, and action, having heard “that he
that looks so as to lust hath committed adultery;” <span
id="fr_2263"></span>[2264](#fn_2263.md) and reflecting that “blessed are
the pure in heart, for they shall see God;” <span
id="fr_2264"></span>[2265](#fn_2264.md) and knowing this, “that not what
enters into the mouth defileth, but that it is what cometh forth by the
mouth that defileth the man. For out of the heart proceed
thoughts.” <span id="fr_2265"></span>[2266](#fn_2265.md) This, as I think,
is the true and just measure according to God, by which things capable
of measurement are measured, the decad which is comprehensive of man;
which summarily the three above-mentioned measures pointed out. There
are body and soul, the five senses, speech, the power of
reproduction—the intellectual or the spiritual faculty, or whatever you
choose to call it. And we must, in a word, ascending above all the
others, stop at the mind; as also certainly in the universe overleaping
the nine divisions, the first consisting of the four elements put in one
place for equal interchange: and then the seven wandering stars and the
one that wanders not, the ninth, to the perfect number, which is above
the nine, <span id="fr_2266"></span>[2267](#fn_2266.md) and the tenth
division, we must reach to the knowledge of God, to speak briefly,
desiring the Maker after the creation. Wherefore the tithes both of the
ephah and of the sacrifices were presented to God; and the paschal feast
began with the tenth day, being the transition from all trouble, and
from all objects of sense.

<span id="vi.iv.ii.xi-p10"></span>The Gnostic is therefore fixed by
faith; but the man who thinks himself wise touches not what pertains to
the truth, moved as he is by unstable and wavering impulses. It is
therefore reasonably written, “Cain went forth from the face of God, and
dwelt in the land of Naid, over against Eden.” Now Naid is interpreted
*commotion*, and Eden *delight;* and Faith, and Knowledge, and Peace are
delight, from which he that has disobeyed is cast out. But he that is
wise in his own eyes will not so much as listen to the beginning of the
divine commandments; but, as if his own teacher, throwing off the reins,
plunges voluntarily into a billowy commotion, sinking down to mortal and
created things from the uncreated knowledge, holding various opinions at
various times. “Those who have no guidance fall like leaves.” <span
id="fr_2267"></span>[2268](#fn_2267.md)

<span id="vi.iv.ii.xi-p12"></span>Reason, the governing principle,
remaining unmoved and guiding the soul, is called its pilot. For access
to the Immutable is obtained by a truly immutable means. Thus Abraham
was stationed before the Lord, and approaching spoke. <span
id="fr_2268"></span>[2269](#fn_2268.md) And to Moses it is said, “But do
thou stand there with Me.” <span id="fr_2269"></span>[2270](#fn_2269.md)
And the followers of Simon wish be assimilated in manners to the
standing form which they adore. Faith, therefore, and the knowledge of
the truth, render the soul, which makes them its choice, always uniform
and equable. For congenial to the man of falsehood is shifting, and
change, and turning away, as to the Gnostic are calmness, and rest, and
peace. As, then, philosophy has been brought into evil repute by pride
and self-conceit, so also gnosis by false gnosis called by the same
name; of which the apostle writing says, “O Timothy, keep that which is
committed to thy trust, avoiding the profane and vain babblings and
oppositions of science (gnosis) falsely so called; which some
professing, have erred concerning the faith.” <span
id="fr_2270"></span>[2271](#fn_2270.md)

<span id="vi.iv.ii.xi-p16"></span>Convicted by this utterance, the
heretics reject the Epistles to Timothy. <span
id="fr_2271"></span>[2272](#fn_2271.md) Well, then, if the Lord is the
truth, and wisdom, and power of God, as in truth He is, it is shown that
the real Gnostic is he that knows Him, and His Father by Him. For his
sentiments are the same with him who said, “The lips of the righteous
know high things.” <span id="fr_2272"></span>[2273](#fn_2272.md)
