<span id="vi.iv.iv.xx"></span>

##### <span id="vi.iv.iv.xx-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXI.—Description of the Perfect Man, or Gnostic.

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xx-p1"></span>Here I find perfection apprehended
variously in relation to Him who excels in every virtue. Accordingly one
is perfected as pious, and as patient, and as continent, and as a
worker, and as a martyr, and as a Gnostic. But I know no one of men
perfect in all things at once, while still human, though according to
the mere letter of the law, except Him alone who for us clothed Himself
with humanity. Who then is perfect? He who professes abstinence from
what is bad. Well, this is the way to the Gospel and to well-doing. But
gnostic perfection in the case of the legal man is the acceptance of the
Gospel, that he that is after the law may be perfect. For so he, who was
after the law, Moses, foretold that it was necessary to hear in order
that we might, according to the apostle, receive Christ, the fulness of
the law. <span id="fr_2872"></span>[2873](#fn_2872.md) But now in the
Gospel the Gnostic attains proficiency not only by making use of the law
as a step, but by understanding and comprehending it, as the Lord who
gave the Covenants delivered it to the apostles. And if he conduct
himself rightly (as assuredly it is impossible to attain knowledge
(*gnosis*) by bad conduct); and if, further, having made an eminently
right confession, he become a martyr out of love, obtaining considerable
renown as among men; not even thus will he be called perfect in the
flesh beforehand; since it is the close of life which claims this
appellation, when the gnostic martyr has first shown the perfect work,
and rightly exhibited it, and having thankfully shed his blood, has
yielded up the ghost: blessed then will he be, and truly proclaimed
perfect, “that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of
us,” as the apostle says. Only let us preserve free-will and love:
“troubled on every side, yet not distressed; perplexed, but not in
despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not
destroyed.” <span id="fr_2873"></span>[2874](#fn_2873.md) For those who
strive after perfection, according to the same apostle, must “give no
offence in anything, but in everything approve themselves not to men,
but to God.” And, as a consequence, also they ought to yield to men; for
it is reasonable, on account of abusive calumnies. Here is the
specification: “in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in
distresses, in stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in
watchings, in fastings, in pureness, in knowledge, in long-suffering, in
kindness, in the Holy Ghost, in love unfeigned, in the word of truth, in
the power of God,” <span id="fr_2874"></span>[2875](#fn_2874.md) that we
may be the temples of God, purified “from all filthiness of the flesh
and of the spirit.” “And I,” He says, “will receive you; and I will be
to you for a Father, and ye shall be to Me for sons and daughters, saith
the Lord Almighty.” <span id="fr_2875"></span>[2876](#fn_2875.md) “Let us
then,” he says, “perfect holiness in the fear of God.” For though fear
beget pain, “I rejoice,” he says, “not that ye were made sorry, but that
ye showed susceptibility to repentance. For ye sorrowed after a godly
sort, that ye might receive damage by us in nothing. For godly sorrow
worketh repentance unto salvation not to be regretted; but the sorrow of
the world worketh death. For this same thing that ye sorrowed after a
godly sort, what earnestness it wrought in you; yea, what clearing of
yourselves; yea, what compunction; yea, what fear; yea, what desire;
yea, what zeal; yea, revenge! In all things ye have showed yourselves
clear in the matter.” <span id="fr_2876"></span>[2877](#fn_2876.md) Such
are the preparatory exercises of gnostic discipline. And since the
omnipotent God Himself “gave some apostles, and some prophets, and some
evangelists, and some pastors and teachers, for the perfecting of the
saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of
Christ, till we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of the
knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the
stature of the fulness of Christ;” <span
id="fr_2877"></span>[2878](#fn_2877.md) we are then to strive to reach
manhood as befits the Gnostic, and to be as perfect as we can while
still abiding in the flesh, making it our study with perfect concord
here to concur with the will of God, to the restoration of what is the
truly perfect nobleness and relationship, to the fulness of Christ, that
which perfectly depends on our perfection.

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xx-p8"></span>And now we perceive where, and how, and
when the divine apostle mentions the perfect man, and how he shows the
differences of the perfect. And again, on the other hand: “The <span
id="page_434">p. 434</span> <span
id="vi.iv.iv.xx-Page_434"></span>manifestation of the Spirit is given
for our profit. For to one is given the word of wisdom by the Spirit; to
another the word of knowledge according to the same Spirit; to another
faith through the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing through
the same Spirit; to another the working of miracles; to another
prophecy; to another discernment of spirits; to another diversities of
tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues: and all these worketh
the one and the same Spirit, distributing to each one according as He
wills.” <span id="fr_2878"></span>[2879](#fn_2878.md) Such being the case,
the prophets are perfect in prophecy, the righteous in righteousness,
and the martyrs in confession, and others in preaching, not that they
are not sharers in the common virtues, but are proficient in those to
which they are appointed. For what man in his senses would say that a
prophet was not righteous? For what? did not righteous men like Abraham
prophesy?

> <span id="vi.iv.iv.xx-p9.2"></span> “For to one God has given warlike
> deeds,  
> To another the accomplishment of the dance,  
> To another the lyre and song,” <span
> id="fr_2879"></span>[2880](#fn_2879.md)  

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xx-p11"></span>says Homer. “But each has his own
proper gift of God” <span id="fr_2880"></span>[2881](#fn_2880.md) —one in
one way, another in another. But the apostles were perfected in all. You
will find, then, if you choose, in their acts and writings, knowledge,
life, preaching, righteousness, purity, prophecy. We must know, then,
that if Paul is young in respect to time <span
id="fr_2881"></span>[2882](#fn_2881.md) —having flourished immediately
after the Lord’s ascension—yet his writings depend on the Old Testament,
breathing and speaking of them. For faith in Christ and the knowledge of
the Gospel are the explanation and fulfilment of the law; and therefore
it was said to the Hebrews, “If ye believe not, neither shall you
understand;” <span id="fr_2882"></span>[2883](#fn_2882.md) that is, unless
you believe what is prophesied in the law, and oracularly delivered by
the law, you will not understand the Old Testament, which He by His
coming expounded.

##### <span id="vi.iv.iv.xx-p14.2"></span>Chapter XXII.—The True Gnostic Does Good, Not from Fear of Punishment or Hope of Reward, But Only for the Sake of Good Itself.

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xx-p15"></span>The man of understanding and
perspicacity is, then, a Gnostic. And his business is not abstinence
from what is evil (for this is a step to the highest perfection), or the
doing of good out of fear. For it is written, “Whither shall I flee, and
where shall I hide myself from Thy presence? If I ascend into heaven,
Thou art there; if I go away to the uttermost parts of the sea, there is
Thy right hand; if I go down into the depths, there is Thy
Spirit.” <span id="fr_2883"></span>[2884](#fn_2883.md) Nor any more is he
to do so from hope of promised recompense. For it is said, “Behold the
Lord, and His reward is before His face, to give to every one according
to his works; what eye hath not seen, and ear hath not heard, and hath
not entered into the heart of man what God hath prepared for them that
love Him.” <span id="fr_2884"></span>[2885](#fn_2884.md) But only the doing
of good out of love, and for the sake of its own excellence, is to be
the Gnostic’s choice. Now, in the person of God it is said to the Lord,
“Ask of Me, and I will give the heathen for Thine inheritance;” <span
id="fr_2885"></span>[2886](#fn_2885.md) teaching Him to ask a truly regal
request—that is, the salvation of men without price, that we may inherit
and possess the Lord. For, on the contrary, to desire knowledge about
God for any practical purpose, that this may be done, or that may not be
done, is not proper to the Gnostic; but the knowledge itself suffices as
the reason for contemplation. For I will dare aver that it is not
because he wishes to be saved that he, who devotes himself to knowledge
for the sake of the divine science itself, chooses knowledge. For the
exertion of the intellect by exercise is prolonged to a perpetual
exertion. And the perpetual exertion of the intellect is the essence of
an intelligent being, which results from an uninterrupted process of
admixture, and remains eternal contemplation, a living substance. Could
we, then, suppose any one proposing to the Gnostic whether he would
choose the knowledge of God or everlasting salvation; and if these,
which are entirely identical, were separable, he would without the least
hesitation choose the knowledge of God, deeming that property of faith,
which from love ascends to knowledge, desirable, for its own sake. This,
then, is the perfect man’s first form of doing good, when it is done not
for any advantage in what pertains to him, but because he judges it
right to do good; and the energy being vigorously exerted in all things,
in the very act becomes good; not, good in some things, and not good in
others; but consisting in the habit of doing good, neither for glory,
nor, as the philosophers say, for reputation, nor from reward either
from men or God; but so as to pass life after the image and likeness of
the Lord.

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xx-p19"></span>And if, in doing good, he be met with
anything adverse, he will let the recompense pass without resentment as
if it were good, he being just and good “to the just and the unjust.” To
such the Lord says, “Be ye, as your Father is perfect.”

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xx-p20"></span>To him the flesh is dead; but he
himself lives alone, having consecrated the sepulchre into a holy temple
to the Lord, having turned towards God the old sinful soul.

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xx-p21"></span>Such an one is no longer continent,
but has <span id="page_435">p. 435</span> <span
id="vi.iv.iv.xx-Page_435"></span>reached a state of passionlessness,
waiting to put on the divine image. “If thou doest alms,” it is said,
“let no one know it; and if thou fastest, anoint thyself, that God alone
may know,” <span id="fr_2886"></span>[2887](#fn_2886.md) and not a single
human being. Not even he himself who shows mercy ought to know that he
does show mercy; for in this way he will be sometimes merciful,
sometimes not. And when he shall do good by habit, he will imitate the
nature of good, and his disposition will be his nature and his practice.
There is no necessity for removing those who are raised on high, but
there is necessity for those who are walking to reach the requisite
goal, by passing over the whole of the narrow way. For this is to be
drawn by the Father, to become worthy to receive the power of grace from
God, so as to run without hindrance. And if some hate the elect, such an
one knows their ignorance, and pities their minds for its folly.

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xx-p23"></span>As is right, then, knowledge itself
loves and teaches the ignorant, and instructs the whole creation to
honour God Almighty. And if such an one teaches to love God, he will not
hold virtue as a thing to be lost in any case, either awake or in a
dream, or in any vision; since the habit never goes out of itself by
falling from being a habit. Whether, then, knowledge be said to be habit
or disposition; on account of diverse sentiments never obtaining access,
the guiding faculty, remaining unaltered, admits no alteration of
appearances by framing in dreams visionary conceptions out of its
movements by day. Wherefore also the Lord enjoins “to watch,” so that
our soul may never be perturbed with passion, even in dreams; but also
to keep the life of the night pure and stainless, as if spent in the
day. For assimilation to God, as far as we can, is preserving the mind
in its relation to the same things. And this is the relation of mind as
mind.

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xx-p24"></span>But the variety of disposition arises
from inordinate affection to material things. And for this reason, as
they appear to me, to have called night Euphrone; since then the soul,
released from the perceptions of sense, turns in on itself, and has a
truer hold of intelligence (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.iv.xx-p24.1"></span>φρόνησις</span>). <span
id="fr_2887"></span>[2888](#fn_2887.md) Wherefore the mysteries are for the
most part celebrated by night, indicating the withdrawal of the soul
from the body, which takes place by night. “Let us not then sleep, as do
others; but let us watch and be sober. For they that sleep, sleep in the
night; and they that are drunken, are drunken in the night. But let us
who are of the day be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and
love, and as an helmet the hope of salvation.” <span
id="fr_2888"></span>[2889](#fn_2888.md) And as to what, again, they say of
sleep, the very same things are to be understood of death. For each
exhibits the departure of the soul, the one more, the other less; as we
may also get this in Heraclitus: “Man touches night in himself, when
dead and his light quenched; and alive, when he sleeps he touches the
dead; and awake, when he shuts his eyes, he touches the sleeper.” <span
id="fr_2889"></span>[2890](#fn_2889.md) “For blessed are those that have
seen the Lord,” <span id="fr_2890"></span>[2891](#fn_2890.md) according to
the apostle; “for it is high time to awake out of sleep. For now is our
salvation nearer than when we believed. The night is far spent, the day
is at hand. Let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and put on
the armour of light.” <span id="fr_2891"></span>[2892](#fn_2891.md) By day
and light he designates figuratively the Son, and by the armour of light
metaphorically the promises.

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xx-p30"></span>So it is said that we ought to go
washed to sacrifices and prayers, clean and bright; and that this
external adornment and purification are practiced for a sign. Now purity
is to think holy thoughts. Further, there is the image of baptism, which
also was handed down to the poets from Moses as follows:—

> <span id="vi.iv.iv.xx-p30.1"></span> “And she having drawn water, and
> wearing on her body clean clothes.” <span
> id="fr_2892"></span>[2893](#fn_2892.md)  

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xx-p32"></span>It is Penelope that is going to
prayer:—

> <span id="vi.iv.iv.xx-p32.1"></span> “And Telemachus,  
> Having washed his hands in the hoary sea, prayed to Athene.” <span
> id="fr_2893"></span>[2894](#fn_2893.md)  

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xx-p34"></span>It was a custom of the Jews to wash
frequently after being in bed. It was then well said,—

> <span id="vi.iv.iv.xx-p34.1"></span> “Be pure, not by washing of
> water, but in the mind.”  

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xx-p35"></span>For sanctity, as I conceive it, is
perfect pureness of mind, and deeds, and thoughts, and words too, and in
its last degree sinlessness in dreams.

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xx-p36"></span>And sufficient purification to a man,
I reckon, is thorough and sure repentance. If, condemning ourselves for
our former actions, we go forward, after these things taking
thought, <span id="fr_2894"></span>[2895](#fn_2894.md) and divesting our
mind both of the things which please us through the senses, and of our
former transgressions.

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xx-p38"></span>If, then, we are to give the etymology
of <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.iv.xx-p38.1"></span>ἐπιστήμη</span>, knowledge, its
signification is to be derived from <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.iv.xx-p38.2"></span>στάσις</span>, placing; for our soul,
which was formerly borne, now in one way, now in another, it settles in
objects. Similarly faith is to be explained etymologically, as the
settling (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.iv.xx-p38.3"></span>στάσις</span>) of our soul respecting that
which is.

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xx-p39"></span>But we desire to learn about the man
who is always and in all things righteous; who, neither dreading the
penalty proceeding from the law, <span id="page_436">p. 436</span> <span
id="vi.iv.iv.xx-Page_436"></span>nor fearing to entertain hatred of evil
in the case of those who live with him and who prosecute the injured,
nor dreading danger at the hands of those who do wrong, remains
righteous. For he who, on account of these considerations, abstains from
anything wrong, is not voluntarily kind, but is good from fear. Even
Epicurus says, that the man who in his estimation was wise, “would not
do wrong to any one for the sake of gain; for he could not persuade
himself that he would escape detection.” So that, if he knew he would
not be detected, he would, according to him, do evil. And such are the
doctrines of darkness. If, too, one shall abstain from doing wrong from
hope of the recompense given by God on account of righteous deeds, he is
not on this supposition spontaneously good. For as fear makes that man
just, so reward makes this one; or rather, makes him appear to be just.
But with the hope after death—a good hope to the good, to the bad the
reverse—not only they who follow after Barbarian wisdom, but also the
Pythagoreans, are acquainted. For the latter also proposed hope as an
end to those who philosophize. Whereas Socrates <span
id="fr_2895"></span>[2896](#fn_2895.md) also, in the *Phædo*, says “that
good souls depart hence with a good hope;” and again, denouncing the
wicked, he sets against this the assertion, “For they live with an evil
hope.” With him Heraclitus manifestly agrees in his dissertations
concerning men: “There awaits man after death what they neither hope nor
think.” Divinely, therefore, Paul writes expressly, “Tribulation
worketh, patience, and patience experience, and experience hope; and
hope maketh not ashamed.” <span id="fr_2896"></span>[2897](#fn_2896.md) For
the patience is on account of the hope in the future. Now hope is
synonymous with the recompense and restitution of hope; which maketh not
ashamed, not being any more vilified.

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xx-p42"></span>But he who obeys the mere call, as he
is called, neither for fear, nor for enjoyments, is on his way to
knowledge (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.iv.xx-p42.1"></span>γνῶσις</span>). For he does not consider
whether any extrinsic lucrative gain or enjoyment follows to him; but
drawn by the love of Him who is the true object of love, and led to what
is requisite, practices piety. So that not even were we to suppose him
to receive from God leave to do things forbidden with impunity; not even
if he were to get the promise that he would receive as a reward the good
things of the blessed; but besides, not even if he could persuade
himself that God would be hoodwinked with reference to what he does
(which is impossible), would he ever wish to do aught contrary to right
reason, having once made choice of what is truly good and worthy of
choice on its own account, and therefore to be loved. For it is not in
the food of the belly, that we have heard good to be situated. But he
has heard that “meat will not commend us,” <span
id="fr_2897"></span>[2898](#fn_2897.md) nor marriage, nor abstinence from
marriage in ignorance; but virtuous gnostic conduct. For the dog, which
is an irrational animal, may be said to be continent, dreading as it
does the uplifted stick, and therefore keeping away from the meat. But
let the predicted promise be taken away, and the threatened dread
cancelled, and the impending danger removed, and the disposition of such
people will be revealed.
