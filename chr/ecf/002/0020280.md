<span id="vi.iii.iii.ii"></span>

##### <span id="vi.iii.iii.ii-p0.1"></span>Chapter II.—Against Embellishing the Body.

<span id="vi.iii.iii.ii-p1"></span>It is not, then, the aspect of the
outward man, but the soul that is to be decorated with the ornament of
goodness; we may say also the flesh with the adornment of temperance.
But those women who beautify the outside, are unawares all waste in the
inner depths, as is the case with the ornaments of the Egyptians; among
whom temples with their porticos and vestibules are carefully
constructed, and groves and sacred fields adjoining; the halls are
surrounded with many pillars; and the walls gleam with foreign stones,
and there is no want of artistic painting; and the temples gleam with
gold, and silver, and amber, and glitter with parti-coloured gems from
India and Ethiopia; and the shrines are veiled with gold-embroidered
hangings.

<span id="vi.iii.iii.ii-p2"></span>But if you enter the penetralia of
the enclosure, and, in haste to behold something better, seek the image
that is the inhabitant of the temple, and if any priest of those that
offer sacrifice there, looking gave, and singing a pæan in the Egyptian
tongue, remove a little of the veil to show the god, he will give you a
hearty laugh at the object of worship. For the deity that is sought, to
whom you have rushed, will not be found within, but a cat, or a
crocodile, or a serpent of the country, or some such beast unworthy of
the temple, but quite worthy of a den, a hole, or the dirt. The god of
the Egyptians appears a beast rolling on a purple couch.

<span id="vi.iii.iii.ii-p3"></span>So those women who wear gold,
occupying themselves in curling at their locks, and engaged in anointing
their cheeks, painting their eyes, and dyeing their hair, and practising
the other pernicious arts of luxury, decking the covering of flesh,—in
truth, imitate the Egyptians, in order to attract their infatuated
lovers.

<span id="vi.iii.iii.ii-p4"></span>But if one withdraw the veil of the
temple, I mean the head-dress, the dye, the clothes, the gold, the
paint, the cosmetics,—that is, the web consisting of them, the veil,
with the view of finding within the true beauty, he will be disgusted, I
know well. For he will not find the image of God dwelling within, as is
meet; but instead of it a fornicator and adulteress has occupied the
shrine of the soul. And the true beast will thus be detected—an ape
smeared with white paint. And that deceitful serpent, devouring the
understanding part of man through vanity, has the soul as its hole,
filling all with deadly poisons; and injecting his own venom of
deception, this pander of a dragon has changed women into harlots. For
love of display is not for a lady, but a courtesan. Such women care
little for keeping at home with their husbands; but loosing their
husbands’ purse-strings, they spend its supplies on their lusts, that
they may have many witnesses of their seemingly fair appearance; and,
devoting the whole day to their toilet, they spend their time with their
bought slaves. Accordingly they season the flesh like a pernicious
sauce; and the day they bestow on the toilet shut up in their rooms, so
as not to be caught decking themselves. But in the evening this spurious
beauty creeps out to candle-light as out of a hole; for drunkenness and
the dimness of the light aid what they have put on. The woman who dyes
her hair yellow, Menander the comic poet expels from the house:—

> <span id="vi.iii.iii.ii-p4.1"></span> “Now get out of this house, for
> no chaste  
> Woman ought to make her hair yellow,”  

<span id="vi.iii.iii.ii-p5"></span>nor, I would add, stain her cheeks,
nor paint her eyes. Unawares the poor wretches destroy their own beauty,
by the introduction of what is spurious. At the dawn of day, mangling,
racking, and plastering themselves over with certain compositions, they
chill the skin, furrow the flesh with poisons, and with curiously
prepared washes, thus blighting their own beauty. Wherefore they are
seen to be yellow from the use of cosmetics, and susceptible to disease,
their flesh, which has been shaded with poisons, being now in a melting
state. So they dishonour the Creator of men, as if the beauty given by
Him were nothing worth. As you might expect, they become lazy in
housekeeping, sitting like painted things to be looked at, not as if
made for domestic economy. Wherefore in the comic poet the sensible
woman says, “What can we women do wise or brilliant, who sit with hair
dyed yellow, outraging the character of gentlewomen; causing the
overthrow of houses, the ruin of nuptials, and accusations on the part
of children?” <span id="fr_1579"></span>[1580](#fn_1579) In the same
way, Antiphanes the comic poet, in *Malthaca,* ridicules the
meretriciousness of women in words that apply to them all, and are
framed against the rubbing of themselves with cosmetics, saying:—

<span id="page_273">p. 273</span> <span
id="vi.iii.iii.ii-Page_273"></span>

> <span id="vi.iii.iii.ii-p6.1"></span> “She comes,  
> She goes back, she approaches, she goes back.  
> She has come, she is here, she washes herself, she advances,  
> She is soaped, she is combed, she goes out, is rubbed,  
> She washes herself, looks in the glass, robes herself,  
> Anoints herself, decks herself, besmears herself;  
> And if aught is wrong, chokes \[with vexation\].”  

<span id="vi.iii.iii.ii-p7"></span>Thrice, I say, not once, do they
deserve to perish, who use crocodiles’ excrement, and anoint themselves
with the froth of putrid humours, and stain their eyebrows with soot,
and rub their cheeks with white lead.

<span id="vi.iii.iii.ii-p8"></span>These, then, who are disgusting even
to the heathen poets for their fashions, how shall they not be rejected
by the truth? <span id="fr_1580"></span>[1581](#fn_1580) Accordingly
another comic poet, Alexis, reproves them. For I shall adduce his words,
which with extravagance of statement shame the obstinacy of their
impudence. For he was not very far beyond the mark. And I cannot for
shame come to the assistance of women held up to such ridicule in
comedy.

<span id="vi.iii.iii.ii-p10"></span>Then she ruins her husband.

> <span id="vi.iii.iii.ii-p10.1"></span> “For first, in comparison with
> gain and the spoiling of neighbours,  
> All else is in their eyes superfluous.”  
> “Is one of them little? She stitches cork into her shoe-sole.  
> Is one tall? She wears a thin sole,  
> And goes out keeping her head down on her shoulder:  
> This takes away from her height. Has one no flanks?  
> She has something sewed on to her, so that the spectators  
> May exclaim on her fine shape behind. Has she a prominent stomach?  
> By making additions, to render it straight, such as the nurses we see
> in the comic poets,  
> She draws back, as it were, by these poles, the protuberance of the
> stomach in front.  
> Has one yellow eyebrows? She stains them with soot.  
> Do they happen to be black? She smears them with ceruse.  
> Is one very white-skinned? She rouges.  
> Has one any part of the body beautiful? She shows it bare.  
> Has she beautiful teeth? She must needs laugh,  
> That those present may see what a pretty mouth she has;  
> But if not in the humour for laughing, she passes the day within,  
> With a slender sprig of myrtle between her lips,  
> Like what cooks have always at hand when they have goats’ heads to
> sell,  
> So that she must keep them apart the whilst, whether she will or
> not.”  

<span id="vi.iii.iii.ii-p11"></span>I set these quotations from the
comic poets <span id="fr_1581"></span>[1582](#fn_1581) before you, since
the Word most strenuously wishes to save us. And by and by I will
fortify them with the divine Scriptures. For he who does not escape
notice is wont to abstain from sins, on account of the shame of reproof.
Just as the plastered hand and the anointed eye exhibit from their very
look the suspicion of a person in illness, so also cosmetics and dyes
indicate that the soul is deeply diseased.

<span id="vi.iii.iii.ii-p13"></span>The divine Instructor enjoins us not
to approach to another’s river, meaning by the figurative expression
“another’s river,” “another’s wife;” the wanton that flows to all, and
out of licentiousness gives herself up to meretricious enjoyment with
all. “Abstain from water that is another’s,” He says, “and drink not of
another’s well,” admonishing us to shun the stream of “voluptuousness,”
that we may live long, and that years of life may be added to us; <span
id="fr_1582"></span>[1583](#fn_1582) both by not hunting after pleasure
that belongs to another, and by diverting our inclinations.

<span id="vi.iii.iii.ii-p15"></span>Love of dainties and love of wine,
though great vices, are not of such magnitude as fondness for
finery. <span id="fr_1583"></span>[1584](#fn_1583) “A full table and
repeated cups” are enough to satisfy greed. But to those who are fond of
gold, and purple, and jewels, neither the gold that is above the earth
and below it is sufficient, nor the Tyrian Sea, nor the freight that
comes from India and Ethiopia, nor yet Pactolus flowing with gold; not
even were a man to become a Midas would he be satisfied, but would be
still poor, craving other wealth. Such people are ready to die with
their gold.

<span id="vi.iii.iii.ii-p17"></span>And if Plutus <span
id="fr_1584"></span>[1585](#fn_1584) is blind, are not those women that
are crazy about him, and have a fellow-feeling with him, blind too?
Having, then, no limit to their lust, they push on to shamelessness. For
the theatre, and pageants, and many spectators, and strolling in the
temples, and loitering in the streets, that they may be seen
conspicuously by all, are necessary to them. For those that glory in
their looks, not in heart, <span id="fr_1585"></span>[1586](#fn_1585)
dress to please others. For as the brand shows the slave, so do gaudy
colours the adulteress. “For though thou clothe thyself in scarlet, and
deck thyself with ornaments of gold, and anoint thine eyes with stibium,
in vain is thy beauty,” <span id="fr_1586"></span>[1587](#fn_1586) says
the Word by Jeremiah. Is it not monstrous, that while horses, birds, and
the rest of the animals, spring and bound from the grass and meadows,
rejoicing in ornament that is their own, in mane, and natural colour,
and varied plumage; woman, as if inferior to the brute creation, should
think herself so unlovely as to need foreign, and bought, and painted
beauty?

<span id="vi.iii.iii.ii-p21"></span>Head-dresses and varieties of
head-dresses, and elaborate braidings, and infinite modes of dressing
the hair, and costly specimens of mirrors, <span id="page_274">p.
274</span> <span id="vi.iii.iii.ii-Page_274"></span>in which they
arrange their costume,—hunting after those that, like silly children,
are crazy about their figures,—are characteristic of women who have lost
all sense of shame. If any one were to call these courtesans, he would
make no mistake, for they turn their faces into masks. But us the Word
enjoins “to look not on the things that are seen, but the things that
are not seen; for the things that are seen are temporal, but the things
that are not seen are eternal.” <span
id="fr_1587"></span>[1588](#fn_1587)

<span id="vi.iii.iii.ii-p23"></span>But what passes beyond the bounds of
absurdity, is that they have invented mirrors for this artificial shape
of theirs, as if it were some excellent work or masterpiece. The
deception rather requires a veil thrown over it. For as the Greek fable
has it, it was not a fortunate thing for the beautiful Narcissus to have
been the beholder of his own image. And if Moses commanded men to make
not an image to represent God by art, how can these women be right, who
by their own reflection produce an imitation of their own likeness, in
order to the falsifying of their faces? Likewise also, when Samuel the
prophet was sent to anoint one of the sons of Jesse for king, and on
seeing the eldest of his sons to be fair and tall, produced the
anointing oil, being delighted with him, the Lord said to him, “Look not
to his appearance, nor the height of his stature: for I have rejected
him. For man looketh on the eyes, but the <span class="sc"><span
id="vi.iii.iii.ii-p23.1"></span>Lord</span> into the heart.” <span
id="fr_1588"></span>[1589](#fn_1588)

<span id="vi.iii.iii.ii-p25"></span>And he anointed not him that was
comely in person, but him that was comely in soul. If, then, the Lord
counts the natural beauty of the body inferior to that of the soul, what
thinks He of spurious beauty, rejecting utterly as He does all
falsehood? “For we walk by faith, not by sight.” <span
id="fr_1589"></span>[1590](#fn_1589) Very clearly the Lord accordingly
teaches by Abraham, that he who follows God must despise country, and
relations, and possessions, and all wealth, by making him a stranger.
And therefore also He called him His friend who had despised the
substance which he had possessed at home. For he was of good parentage,
and very opulent; and so with three hundred and eighteen servants of his
own he subdued the four kings who had taken Lot captive.

<span id="vi.iii.iii.ii-p27"></span>Esther alone we find justly adorned.
The spouse adorned herself mystically for her royal husband; but her
beauty turns out the redemption price of a people that were about to be
massacred. And that decoration makes women courtesans, and men
effeminate and adulterers, the tragic poet is a witness; thus
discoursing:—

> <span id="vi.iii.iii.ii-p27.1"></span> “He that judged the
> goddesses,  
> As the myth of the Argives has it, having come from Phrygia  
> To Lacedæmon, arrayed in flowery vestments,  
> Glittering with gold and barbaric luxury,  
> Loving, departed, carrying away her he loved,  
> Helen, to the folds of Ida, having found that  
> Menelaus was away from home.” <span
> id="fr_1590"></span>[1591](#fn_1590)  

<span id="vi.iii.iii.ii-p29"></span>O adulterous beauty! Barbarian
finery and effeminate luxury overthrew Greece; Lacedæmonian chastity was
corrupted by clothes, and luxury, and graceful beauty; barbaric display
proved Jove’s daughter a courtesan.

<span id="vi.iii.iii.ii-p30"></span>They had no instructor <span
id="fr_1591"></span>[1592](#fn_1591) to restrain their lusts, nor one to
say, “Do not commit adultery;” nor, “Lust not;” or, “Travel not by lust
into adultery;” or further, “Influence not thy passions by desire of
adornment.”

<span id="vi.iii.iii.ii-p32"></span>What an end was it that ensued to
them, and what woes they endured, who would not restrain their
self-will! Two continents were convulsed by unrestrained pleasures, and
all was thrown into confusion by a barbarian boy. The whole of Hellas
puts to sea; the ocean is burdened with the weight of continents; a
protracted war breaks out, and fierce battles are waged, and the plains
are crowded with dead: the barbarian assails the fleet with outrage;
wickedness prevails, and the eye of that poetic Jove looks on the
Thracians:—

> <span id="vi.iii.iii.ii-p32.1"></span> “The barbarian plains drink
> noble blood,  
> And the streams of the rivers are choked with dead bodies.”  

<span id="vi.iii.iii.ii-p33"></span>Breasts are beaten in lamentations,
and grief desolates the land; and all the feet, and the summits of
many-fountained Ida, and the cities of the Trojans, and the ships of the
Achæans, shake.

<span id="vi.iii.iii.ii-p34"></span>Where, O Homer, shall we flee and
stand? Show us a spot of ground that is not shaken!—

> <span id="vi.iii.iii.ii-p34.1"></span> “Touch not the reins,
> inexperienced boy,  
> Nor mount the seat, not having learned to drive.” <span
> id="fr_1592"></span>[1593](#fn_1592)  

<span id="vi.iii.iii.ii-p36"></span>Heaven delights in two charioteers,
by whom alone the chariot of fire is guided. For the mind is carried
away by pleasure; and the unsullied principle of reason, when not
instructed by the Word, slides down into licentiousness, and gets a fall
as the due reward of its transgression. An example of this are the
angels, who renounced the beauty of God for a beauty which fades, and so
fell from heaven to earth. <span id="fr_1593"></span>[1594](#fn_1593)

<span id="vi.iii.iii.ii-p38"></span>The Shechemites, too, were punished
by an overthrow for dishonouring the holy virgin. The grave was their
punishment, and the monument of their ignominy leads to salvation.
