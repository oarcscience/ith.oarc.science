##### <span id="vi.iv.vii.ix-p0.1"></span>Chapter IX.—Those Who Teach Others, Ought to Excel in Virtues.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.ix-p1"></span>The gnostic dignity is augmented and
increased by him who has undertaken the first place in the teaching of
others, and received the dispensation by word and deed of the greatest
good on earth, by which he mediates contact and fellowship with the
Divinity. And as those who worship terrestrial things pray to them as if
they heard, confirming compacts before them; so, in men who are living
images, the true majesty of the Word is received by the trustworthy
teacher; and the beneficence exerted towards them is carried up to the
Lord, after whose image he who is a true man by instruction creates and
harmonizes, renewing to salvation the man who receives instruction. For
as the Greeks called steel *Ares*, and wine *Dionysus,* on account of a
certain relation; so the Gnostic considering the benefit of his
neighbours as his own salvation, may be called a living image of the
Lord, not as respects the peculiarity of form, but the symbol of power
and similarity of preaching.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.ix-p2"></span>Whatever, therefore, he has in his
mind, he bears on his tongue, to those who are worthy to hear, speaking
as well as living from assent and inclination. For he both thinks and
speaks the truth; unless at any time, medicinally, as a physician for
the safety of the sick, he may deceive or tell an untruth, according to
the Sophists. <span id="fr_3584"></span>[3585](#fn_3584.md)

<span id="vi.iv.vii.ix-p4"></span>To illustrate: the noble apostle
circumcised Timothy, though loudly declaring and writing that
circumcision made with hands profits nothing. <span
id="fr_3585"></span>[3586](#fn_3585.md) But that he might not, by dragging
all at once away from the law to the circumcision of the heart through
faith those of the Hebrews who were reluctant listeners, compel them to
break away from the synagogue, he, “accommodating himself to the Jews,
became a Jew that he might gain all.” <span
id="fr_3586"></span>[3587](#fn_3586.md) He, then, who submits to
accommodate himself merely for the benefit of his neighbours, for the
salvation of those for whose sake he accommodates himself, not partaking
in any dissimulation through the peril impending over the just from
those who envy them, such an one by no means acts with compulsion. <span
id="fr_3587"></span>[3588](#fn_3587.md) But for the benefit of his
neighbours alone, he will do things which would not have been done by
him primarily, if he did not do them on their account. Such an one gives
himself for the Church, for the disciples whom he has begotten in faith;
for an example to those who are capable of receiving the supreme economy
of the philanthropic and God-loving Instructor, for confirmation of the
truth of his words, for the exercise of love to the Lord. Such an one is
unenslaved by fear, true in word, enduring in labour, never willing to
lie by uttered word, and in it always securing sinlessness; since
falsehood, being spoken with a certain deceit, is not an inert word, but
operates to mischief.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.ix-p8"></span>On every hand, then, the Gnostic alone
testifies to the truth in deed and word. For he always does rightly in
all things, both in word and action, and in thought itself.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.ix-p9"></span>Such, then, to speak cursorily, is the
piety of the Christian. If, then, he does these things according to duty
and right reason, he does them piously and justly. And if such be the
case, the Gnostic alone is really both pious, and just, and God-fearing.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.ix-p10"></span>The Christian is not impious. For
this was the point incumbent on us to demonstrate to the philosophers;
so that he will never in any way do aught bad or base (which is unjust).
Consequently, therefore, he is not impious; but he alone fears God,
holily and dutifully worshipping the true God, the universal Ruler, and
King, and Sovereign, with the true piety.
