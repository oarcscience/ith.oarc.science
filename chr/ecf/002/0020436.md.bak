##### <span id="vi.iv.viii.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.—Definitions, Genera, and Species.

<span id="vi.iv.viii.vi-p1"></span>The introductions and sources of
questions are about these points and in them.

<span id="vi.iv.viii.vi-p2"></span>But before definitions, and
demonstrations, and divisions, it must be propounded in what ways the
question is stated; and equivocal terms are to be treated; and synomyms
stated accurately according to their significations.

<span id="vi.iv.viii.vi-p3"></span>Then it is to be inquired whether the
proposition belongs to those points, which are considered in relation to
others, or is taken by itself. Further, If it is, what it is, what
happens to it; or thus, also, if it is, what it is, why it is. And to
the consideration of these points, the knowledge of Particulars and
Universals, and the Antecedents and the Differences, and their
divisions, contribute.

<span id="vi.iv.viii.vi-p4"></span>Now, Induction aims at generalization
and definition; and the divisions are the species, and what a thing is,
and the individual. The contemplation of the How adduces the assumption
of what is peculiar; and doubts bring the particular differences and the
demonstrations, and otherwise augment the speculation and its
consequences; and the result of the whole is scientific knowledge and
truth.

<span id="vi.iv.viii.vi-p5"></span>Again, the summation resulting from
Division becomes Definition. For Definition is adopted before division
and after: before, when it is admitted or stated; after, when it is
demonstrated. And by Sensation the Universal is summed up from the
Particular. For the starting point of Induction is Sensation; and the
end is the Universal.

<span id="page_563">p. 563</span> <span
id="vi.iv.viii.vi-Page_563"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.viii.vi-p6"></span>Induction, accordingly, shows not
*what* a thing is, but *that* it is, or is not. Division shows what it
is; and Definition similarly with Division teaches the essence and what
a thing is, but not if it is; while Demonstration explains the three
points, *if* it is, *what* it is, and *why* it is.

<span id="vi.iv.viii.vi-p7"></span>There are also Definitions which
contain the Cause. And since it may be known when we see, when we see
the Cause; and Causes are four—the matter, the moving power, the
species, the end; Definition will be fourfold.

<span id="vi.iv.viii.vi-p8"></span>Accordingly we must first take the
genus, in which are the points that are nearest those above; and after
this the next difference. And the succession of differences, when cut
and divided, completes the “What it is.” There is no necessity for
expressing all the differences of each thing, but those which form the
species.

<span id="vi.iv.viii.vi-p9"></span>Geometrical analysis and synthesis
are similar to logical division and definition; and by division we get
back to what is simple and more elementary. We divide, therefore, the
genus of what is proposed for consideration into the species contained
in it; as, in the case of man, we divide animal, which is the genus,
into the species that appear in it, the mortal, and the immortal. And
thus, by continually dividing those genera that seem to be compound into
the simpler species, we arrive at the point which is the subject of
investigation, and which is incapable of further division.

<span id="vi.iv.viii.vi-p10"></span>For, after dividing “the animal”
into mortal and immortal, then into terrestrial and aquatic; and the
terrestrial again into those who fly and those who walk; and so dividing
the species which is nearest to what is sought, which also contains what
is sought, we arrive by division at the simplest species, which contains
nothing else, but what is sought alone.

<span id="vi.iv.viii.vi-p11"></span>For again we divide that which walks
into rational and irrational; and then selecting from the species,
apprehended by division, those next to man, and combining them into one
formula, we state the definition of a man, who is an animal, mortal,
terrestrial, walking, rational.

<span id="vi.iv.viii.vi-p12"></span>Whence Division furnishes the class
of matter, seeking for the definition the simplicity of the name; and
the definition of the artisan and maker, by composition and
construction, presents the knowledge of the thing as it is; not of those
things of which we have general notions. To these notions we say that
explanatory expressions belong. For to these notions, also, divisions
are applicable.

<span id="vi.iv.viii.vi-p13"></span>Now one Division divides that which
is divided into species, as a genus; and another into parts, as a whole;
and another into accidents.

<span id="vi.iv.viii.vi-p14"></span>The division, then, of a whole into
the parts, is, for the most part, conceived with reference to magnitude;
that into the accidents can never be entirely explicated, if,
necessarily, essence is inherent in each of the existences.

<span id="vi.iv.viii.vi-p15"></span>Whence both these divisions are to
be rejected, and only the division of the genus into species is
approved, by which both the identity that is in the genus is
characterized, and the diversity which subsists in the specific
differences.

<span id="vi.iv.viii.vi-p16"></span>The species is always contemplated
in a part. On the other hand, however, if a thing is part of another, it
will not be also a species. For the hand is a part of a man, but it is
not a species. And the genus exists in the species. For \[the genus\] is
both in man and the ox. But the whole is not in the parts. For the man
is not in his feet. Wherefore also the species is more important than
the part; and whatever things are predicated of the genus will be all
predicated of the species.

<span id="vi.iv.viii.vi-p17"></span>It is best, then, to divide the
genus into two, if not into three species. The species then being
divided more generically, are characterized by sameness and difference.
And then being divided, they are characterized by the points generically
indicated.

<span id="vi.iv.viii.vi-p18"></span>For each of the species is either an
essence; as when we say, Some substances are corporeal and some
incorporeal; or how much, or what relation, or where, or when, or doing,
or suffering.

<span id="vi.iv.viii.vi-p19"></span>One, therefore, will give the
definition of whatever he possesses the knowledge of; as one can by no
means be acquainted with that which he cannot embrace and define in
speech. And in consequence of ignorance of the definition, the result
is, that many disputes and deceptions arise. For if he that knows the
thing has the knowledge of it in his mind, and can explain by words what
he conceives; and if the explanation of the thought is definition; then
he that knows the thing must of necessity be able also to give the
definition.

<span id="vi.iv.viii.vi-p20"></span>Now in definitions, difference is
assumed, which, in the definition, occupies the place of sign. The
faculty of laughing, accordingly, being added to the definition of man,
makes the whole—a rational, mortal, terrestrial, walking, laughing
animal. For the things added by way of difference to the definition are
the signs of the properties of things; but do not show the nature of the
things themselves. Now they say that the difference is the assigning of
what is peculiar; and as that which has the difference differs from all
the rest, that which belongs to it alone, and is predicated conversely
of the thing, must in definitions be assumed by the first genus as
principal and fundamental.

<span id="vi.iv.viii.vi-p21"></span>Accordingly, in the larger
definitions the number of the species that are discovered are in the ten
Categories; and in the least, the principal points of the nearest
species being taken, mark the essence and nature of the thing. But the
least consists of three, the genus and two <span id="page_564">p.
564</span> <span id="vi.iv.viii.vi-Page_564"></span>essentially
necessary species. And this is done for the sake of brevity.

<span id="vi.iv.viii.vi-p22"></span>We say, then, Man is the laughing
animal. And we must assume that which pre-eminently happens to what is
defined, or its peculiar virtue, or its peculiar function, and the like.

<span id="vi.iv.viii.vi-p23"></span>Accordingly, while the definition is
explanatory of the essence of the thing, it is incapable of accurately
comprehending its nature. By means of the principal species, the
definition makes an exposition of the essence, and almost has the
essence in the quality.
