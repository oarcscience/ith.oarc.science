<p><a name="iv.ii.ii.xxiii-p1"></A>Man, therefore, God made on the sixth day, and made known this creation after the seventh day, when also He made Paradise, that he might be in a better and distinctly superior place. And that this is true, the fact itself proves. For how can one miss seeing that the pains which women suffer in childbed, and the oblivion of their labours which they afterwards enjoy, are sent in order that the word of God may be fulfilled, and that the race of men may increase and multiply?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_597"></A><A HREF="#fn_597"><FONT SIZE="1">598</FONT></A>
 And do we not see also the judgment of the serpent,&#8212;how hatefully he crawls on his belly and eats the dust,&#8212;that we may have this, too, for a proof of the things which were said aforetime?</p>

<p><a name="iv.ii.ii.xxiii-p2"></A> The Benedictine editor remarks: &#8220;Women bring forth with labour and pain as the punishment awarded to sin: they forget the pain, that the propagation of the race may not be hindered.&#8221;</p>
