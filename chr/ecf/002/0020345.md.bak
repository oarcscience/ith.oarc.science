##### <span id="vi.iv.ii.xxi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXI.—Opinions of Various Philosophers on the Chief Good.

<span id="vi.iv.ii.xxi-p1"></span>Epicurus, in placing happiness in not
being hungry, or thirsty, or cold, uttered that godlike word, saying
impiously that he would fight in these points even with Father Jove;
teaching, as if it were the case of pigs that live in filth and not that
of rational philosophers, that happiness was victory. For of those that
are ruled by pleasure are the Cyrenaics and Epicurus; for these
expressly said that to live pleasantly was the chief end, and that
pleasure was the only perfect good. Epicurus also says that the removal
of pain is pleasure; and says that that is to be preferred, which first
attracts from itself to itself, being, that is, wholly in motion.
Dinomachus and Callipho said that the chief end was for one to do what
he could for the attainment and enjoyment of pleasure; and Hieronymus
the Peripatetic said the great end was to live unmolested, and that the
only final good was happiness; and Diodorus likewise, who belonged to
the same sect, pronounces the end to be to live undisturbed and well.
Epicurus indeed, and the Cyrenaics, say that pleasure is the first duty;
for it is for the sake of pleasure, they say, <span id="page_375">p.
375</span> <span id="vi.iv.ii.xxi-Page_375"></span>that virtue was
introduced, and produced pleasure. According to the followers of
Calliphon, virtue was introduced for the sake of pleasure, but that
subsequently, on seeing its own beauty, it made itself equally prized
with the first principle, that is, pleasure.

<span id="vi.iv.ii.xxi-p2"></span>But the Aristotelians lay it down,
that to live in accordance with virtue is the end, but that neither
happiness nor the end is reached by every one who has virtue. For the
wise man, vexed and involved in involuntary mischances, and wishing
gladly on these accounts to flee from life, is neither fortunate nor
happy. For virtue needs time; for that is not acquired in one day which
exists \[only\] in the perfect man since, as they say, a child is never
happy. But human life is a perfect time, and therefore happiness is
completed by the three kinds of good things. Neither, then, the poor,
nor the mean nor even the diseased, nor the slave, can be one of them.

<span id="vi.iv.ii.xxi-p3"></span>Again, on the other hand, Zeno the
Stoic thinks the end to be living according to virtue; and, Cleanthes,
living agreeably to nature in the right exercise of reason, which he
held to consist of the selection of things according to nature. And
Antipatrus, his friend, supposes the end to consist in choosing
continually and unswervingly the things which are according to nature,
and rejecting those contrary to nature. Archedamus, on the other hand,
explained the end to be such, that in selecting the greatest and chief
things according to nature, it was impossible to overstep it. In
addition to these, Panætius pronounced the end to be, to live according
to the means given to us by nature. And finally, Posidonius said that it
was to live engaged in contemplating the truth and order of the
universe, and forming himself as he best can, in nothing influenced by
the irrational part of his soul. And some of the later Stoics defined
the great end to consist in living agreeably to the constitution of man.
Why should I mention Aristo? He said that the end was indifference; but
what is indifferent simply abandons the indifferent. Shall I bring
forward the opinions of Herillus? Herillus states the end to be to live
according to science. For some think that the more recent disciples of
the Academy define the end to be, the steady abstraction of the mind to
its own impressions. Further, Lycus the Peripatetic used to say that the
final end was the true joy of the soul; as Leucimus, that it was the joy
it had in what was good. Critolaus, also a Peripatetic, said that it was
the perfection of a life flowing rightly according to nature, referring
to the perfection accomplished by the three kinds according to
tradition.

<span id="vi.iv.ii.xxi-p4"></span>We must, however, not rest satisfied
with these, but endeavour as we best can to adduce the doctrines laid
down on the point by the naturalist; for they say that Anaxagoras of
Clazomenæ affirmed contemplation and the freedom flowing from it to be
the end of life; Heraclitus the Ephesian, complacency. The Pontic
Heraclides relates, that Pythagoras taught that the knowledge of the
perfection of the numbers <span id="fr_2408"></span>[2409](#fn_2408.md) was
happiness of the soul. The Abderites also teach the existence of an end.
Democritus, in his work *On the Chief End*, said it was cheerfulness,
which he also called well-being, and often exclaims, “For delight and
its absence are the boundary of those who have reached full age;”
Hecatæus, that it was sufficiency to one’s self; Apollodotus of Cyzicum,
that it was delectation; as Nausiphanes, that it was
undauntedness, <span id="fr_2409"></span>[2410](#fn_2409.md) for he said
that it was this that was called by Democritus imperturbability. In
addition to these still, Diotimus declared the end to be perfection of
what is good, which he said was termed well-being. Again, Antisthenes,
that it was humility. And those called Annicereans, of the Cyrenaic
succession, laid down no definite end for the whole of life; but said
that to each action belonged, as its proper end, the pleasure accruing
from the action. These Cyrenaics reject Epicurus’ definition of
pleasure, that is the removal of pain, calling that the condition of a
dead man; because we rejoice not only on account of pleasures, but
companionships and distinctions; while Epicurus thinks that all joy of
the soul arises from previous sensations of the flesh. Metrodorus, in
his book *On the Source of Happiness in Ourselves being greater than
that which arises from Objects*, says: What else is the good of the soul
but the sound state of the flesh, and the sure hope of its continuance?
