##### <span id="vi.ii.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.—By Divine Inspiration Philosophers Sometimes Hit on the Truth.

<span id="vi.ii.vi-p1"></span>A great crowd of this description rushes
on my mind, introducing, as it were, a terrifying apparition of strange
demons, speaking of fabulous and monstrous shapes, in old wives’ talk.
Far from enjoining men to listen to such tales are we, who avoid the
practice of soothing our crying children, as the saying is, by telling
them fabulous stories, being afraid of fostering in their minds the
impiety professed by those who, though wise in their own conceit, have
no more knowledge of the truth than infants. For why (in the name of
truth!) do you make those who believe you subject to ruin and
corruption, dire and irretrievable? Why, I beseech you, fill up life
with idolatrous images, by feigning the winds, or the air, or fire, or
earth, or stones, or stocks, or steel, or this universe, to be gods;
and, prating loftily of the heavenly bodies in this much vaunted science
of astrology, not astronomy, to those men who have truly wandered, talk
of the wandering stars as gods? It is the Lord of the spirits, the Lord
of the fire, the Maker of the universe, Him who lighted up the sun, that
I long for. I seek after God, not the works of God. Whom shall I take as
a helper in my inquiry? We do not, if you have no objection, wholly
disown Plato. How, then, is God to be searched out, O Plato? “For both
to find the Father and Maker of this universe is a work of difficulty;
and having found Him, to declare Him fully, is impossible.” <span
id="fr_920"></span>[921](#fn_920)

<span id="vi.ii.vi-p3"></span>Why so? by Himself, I beseech you! For He
can by no means be expressed. Well done, Plato! Thou hast touched on the
truth. But do not flag. Undertake with me the inquiry respecting the
Good. For into all men whatever, especially those who are occupied with
intellectual pursuits, a certain divine effluence has been instilled;
wherefore, though reluctantly, they confess that God is one,
indestructible, unbegotten, and that somewhere above in the tracts of
heaven, in His own peculiar appropriate eminence, whence He surveys all
things, He has an existence true and eternal.

> <span id="vi.ii.vi-p3.1"></span> “Tell me what I am to conceive God to
> be,  
> Who sees all things, and is Himself unseen,”  

<span id="vi.ii.vi-p4"></span>Euripides says. Accordingly, Menander
seems to me to have fallen into error when he said:—

> <span id="vi.ii.vi-p4.1"></span> “O sun! for thou, first of gods,
> ought to be worshipped,  
> By whom it is that we are able to see the other gods.”  

<span id="vi.ii.vi-p5"></span>For the sun never could show me the true
God; but that healthful Word, that is the Sun of the soul, by whom
alone, when He arises in the depths of the soul, the eye of the soul
itself is irradiated. Whence accordingly, Democritus, not without
reason, says, “that a few of the men of intellect, raising their hands
upwards to what we Greeks now call the air (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ii.vi-p5.1"></span>ἀήρ</span>), called the whole expanse Zeus, or
God: He, too, knows all things, gives and takes away, and He is King of
all.”

<span id="vi.ii.vi-p6"></span>Of the same sentiments is Plato, who
somewhere alludes to God thus: “Around the King of all are all things,
and He is the cause of all good things.” Who, then, is the King of all?
God, who is the measure of the truth of all existence. As, then, the
things that are to be measured are contained in the measure, so also the
knowledge of God measures and comprehends truth. And the truly holy
Moses says: “There shall not be in thy bag a balance and a balance,
great or small, but a true and just balance shall be to thee,” <span
id="fr_921"></span>[922](#fn_921) deeming the balance and measure and
number of the whole to be God. For the unjust and unrighteous idols are
hid at home in the bag, and, so to speak, in the polluted soul. But the
only just measure is the only true God, always just, continuing the
self-same; who measures all things, and weighs them by righteousness as
in a balance, grasping and sustaining universal nature in equilibrium.
“God, therefore, as the old saying has it, occupying the beginning, the
middle, and the end of all that is in being, keeps the straight course,
while He makes the circuit of nature; and justice always follows Him,
avenging those who violate the divine law.”

<span id="vi.ii.vi-p8"></span>Whence, O Plato, is that hint of the truth
which thou givest? Whence this rich copiousness <span id="page_192">p.
192</span> <span id="vi.ii.vi-Page_192"></span>of diction, which
proclaims piety with oracular utterance? The tribes of the barbarians,
he says, are wiser than these; I know thy teachers, even if thou wouldst
conceal them. You have learned geometry from the Egyptians, astronomy
from the Babylonians; the charms of healing you have got from the
Thracians; the Assyrians also have taught you many things; but for the
laws that are consistent with truth, and your sentiments respecting God,
you are indebted to the Hebrews, <span id="fr_922"></span>[923](#fn_922)

> <span id="vi.ii.vi-p9.1"></span> “Who do not worship through vain
> deceits  
> The works of men, of gold, and brass, and silver, and ivory,  
> And images of dead men, of wood and stone,  
> Which other men, led by their foolish inclinations, worship;  
> But raise to heaven pure arms:  
> When they rise from bed, purifying themselves with water,  
> And worship alone the Eternal, who reigns for ever more.”  

<span id="vi.ii.vi-p10"></span>And let it not be this one man
alone—Plato; but, O philosophy, hasten to produce many others also, who
declare the only true God to be God, through His inspiration, if in any
measure they have grasped the truth. For Antisthenes did not think out
this doctrine of the Cynics; but it is in virtue of his being a disciple
of Socrates that he says, “that God is not like to any; wherefore no one
can know Him from an image.” And Xenophon the Athenian would have in his
own person committed freely to writing somewhat of the truth, and given
the same testimony as Socrates, had he not been afraid of the cup of
poison, which Socrates had to drink. But he hints nothing less; he says:
“How great and powerful He is who moves all things, and is Himself at
rest, is manifest; but what He is in form is not revealed. The sun
himself, intended to be the source of light to all around, does not deem
it fitting to allow himself to be looked at; but if any one audaciously
gazes on him, he is deprived of sight.” Whence, then, does the son of
Gryllus learn his wisdom? Is it not manifestly from the prophetess of
the Hebrews <span id="fr_923"></span>[924](#fn_923) who prophesies in
the following style?—

> <span id="vi.ii.vi-p11.1"></span> “What flesh can see with the eye the
> celestial,  
> The true, the immortal God, who inhabits the vault of heaven?  
> Nay, men born mortal cannot even stand  
> Before the rays of the sun.”  

<span id="vi.ii.vi-p12"></span>Cleanthes Pisadeus, <span
id="fr_924"></span>[925](#fn_924) the Stoic philosopher, who exhibits
not a poetic theogony, but a true theology, has not concealed what
sentiments he entertained respecting God:—

> <span id="vi.ii.vi-p13.1"></span> “If you ask me what is the nature of
> the good, listen:  
> That which is regular, just, holy, pious.  
> Self-governing, useful, fair, fitting,  
> Grave, independent, always beneficial;  
> That feels no fear or grief; profitable, painless,  
> Helpful, pleasant, safe, friendly;  
> Held in esteem, agreeing with itself, honourable;  
> Humble, careful, meek, zealous,  
> Perennial, blameless, ever-during:  
> Mean is every one who looks to opinion  
> With the view of obtaining some advantage from it.”  

<span id="vi.ii.vi-p14"></span>Here, as I think, he clearly teaches of
what nature God is; and that the common opinion and religious customs
enslave those that follow them, but seek not after God.

<span id="vi.ii.vi-p15"></span>We must not either keep the Pythagoreans
in the background, who say: “God is one; and He is not, as some suppose,
outside of this frame of things, but within it; but, in all the
entireness of His being, is in the whole circle of existence, surveying
all nature, and blending in harmonious union the whole,—the author of
all His own forces and works, the giver of light in heaven, and Father
of all,—the mind and vital power of the whole world,—the mover of all
things.” For the knowledge of God, these utterances, written by those we
have mentioned through the inspiration of God, and selected by us, may
suffice even for the man that has but small power to examine into truth.
