#### <span id="ii.iii.iv-p0.1"></span>Commandment Fourth.

##### <span id="ii.iii.iv-p0.2"></span>On Putting One’s Wife Away for Adultery.

##### <span id="ii.iii.iv-p0.3"></span>Chap. I.

<span id="ii.iii.iv-p1"></span>“I charge you,” said he, “to guard your
chastity, and let no thought enter your heart of another man’s wife, or
of fornication, or of similar iniquities; for by doing this you commit a
great sin. But if you always remember your own wife, you will never sin.
For if this thought <span id="fr_164"></span>[165](#fn_164.md) enter your
heart, then you will sin; and if, in like manner, you think other wicked
thoughts, you commit sin. For this thought is great sin in a servant of
God. But if any one commit this wicked deed, he works death for himself.
Attend, therefore, and refrain from this thought; for where purity
dwells, there iniquity ought not to enter the heart of a righteous man.”
I said to him, “Sir, permit me to ask you a few questions.” <span
id="fr_165"></span>[166](#fn_165.md) “Say on,” said he. And I said to him,
“Sir, if any one has a wife who trusts in the Lord, and if he detect her
in adultery, does the man sin if he continue to live with her?” And he
said to me, “As long as he remains ignorant of her sin, the husband
commits no transgression in living with her. But if the husband know
that his wife has gone astray, and if the woman does not repent, but
persists in her fornication, and yet the husband continues to live with
her, he also is guilty of her crime, and a sharer in her adultery.” And
I said to him, “What then, sir, is the husband to do, if his wife
continue in her vicious practices?” And he said, “The husband should put
her away, and remain by himself. But if he put his wife away and marry
another, he also commits adultery.” <span
id="fr_166"></span>[167](#fn_166.md) And I said to him, “What if the woman
put away should repent, and wish to return to her husband: shall she not
be taken back by her husband?” And he said to me, “Assuredly. If the
husband do not take her back, he sins, and brings a great sin upon
himself; for he ought to take back the sinner who has repented. But not
frequently. <span id="fr_167"></span>[168](#fn_167.md) For there is but one
repentance to the servants of God. In case, therefore, that the divorced
wife may repent, the husband ought not to marry another, when his wife
has been put away. In this matter man and woman are to be treated
exactly in the same way. Moreover, adultery is committed not only by
those who pollute their flesh, but by those who imitate the heathen in
their actions. <span id="fr_168"></span>[169](#fn_168.md) Wherefore if any
one <span id="fr_169"></span>[170](#fn_169.md) <span id="page_22">p.
22</span> <span id="ii.iii.iv-Page_22"></span>persists in such deeds,
and repents not, withdraw from him, and cease to live with him,
otherwise you are a sharer in his sin. Therefore has the injunction been
laid on you, that you should remain by yourselves, both man and woman,
for in such persons repentance can take place. But I do not,” said he,
“give opportunity for the doing of these deeds, but that he who has
sinned may sin no more. But with regard to his previous transgressions,
there is One who is able to provide a cure; <span
id="fr_170"></span>[171](#fn_170.md) for it is He, indeed, who has power
over all.”

##### <span id="ii.iii.iv-p8.2"></span>Chap. II.

<span id="ii.iii.iv-p9"></span>I asked him again, and said, “Since the
Lord has vouchsafed to dwell always with me, bear with me while I utter
a few words; <span id="fr_171"></span>[172](#fn_171.md) for I understand
nothing, and my heart has been hardened by my previous mode of life.
Give me understanding, for I am exceedingly dull, and I understand
absolutely nothing.” And he answered and said unto me, “I am set over
repentance, and I give understanding to all who repent. Do you not
think,” he said, “that it is great wisdom to repent? for repentance is
great wisdom. <span id="fr_172"></span>[173](#fn_172.md) For he who has
sinned understands that he acted wickedly in the sight of the Lord, and
remembers the actions he has done, and he repents, and no longer acts
wickedly, but does good munificently, and humbles and torments his soul
because he has sinned. You see, therefore, that repentance is great
wisdom.” And I said to him, “It is for this reason, sir, that I inquire
carefully into all things, especially because I am a sinner; that I may
know what works I should do, that I may live: for my sins are many and
various.” And he said to me, “You shall live if you keep my
commandments, <span id="fr_173"></span>[174](#fn_173.md) and walk in them;
and whosoever shall hear and keep these commandments, shall live to
God.”

##### <span id="ii.iii.iv-p12.2"></span>Chap. III.

<span id="ii.iii.iv-p13"></span>And I said to him, “I should like to
continue my questions.” “Speak on,” said he. And I said, “I heard, sir,
some teachers maintain that there is no other repentance than that which
takes place, when we descended into the water <span
id="fr_174"></span>[175](#fn_174.md) and received remission of our former
sins.” He said to me, “That was sound doctrine which you heard; for that
is really the case. For he who has received remission of his sins ought
not to sin any more, but to live in purity. Since, however, you inquire
diligently into all things, I will point this also out to you, not as
giving occasion for error to those who are to believe, or have lately
believed, in the Lord. For those who have now believed, and those who
are to believe, have not repentance for their sins; but they have
remission of their previous sins. For to those who have been called
before these days, the Lord has set repentance. For the Lord, knowing
the heart, and foreknowing all things, knew the weakness of men and the
manifold wiles of the devil, that he would inflict some evil on the
servants of God, and would act wickedly towards them. <span
id="fr_175"></span>[176](#fn_175.md) The Lord, therefore, being merciful,
has had mercy on the work of His hand, and has set repentance for them;
and He has entrusted to me power over this repentance. And therefore I
say to you, that if any one is tempted by the devil, and sins after that
great and holy calling in which the Lord has called His people to
everlasting life, <span id="fr_176"></span>[177](#fn_176.md) he has
opportunity to repent but once. But if he should sin frequently after
this, and then repent, to such a man his repentance will be of no avail;
for with difficulty will he live.” <span
id="fr_177"></span>[178](#fn_177.md) And I said, “Sir, I feel that life has
come back to me in listening attentively to these commandments; for I
know that I shall be saved, if in future I sin no more.” And he said,
“You will be saved, you and all who keep these commandments.”

##### <span id="ii.iii.iv-p17.1"></span>Chap. IV.

<span id="ii.iii.iv-p18"></span>And again I asked him, saying, “Sir,
since you have been so patient in listening to me, will you show me this
also?” “Speak,” said he. And I said, “If a wife or husband die, and the
widower or widow marry, does he or she commit sin?” “There is no sin in
marrying again,” said he; “but if they remain unmarried, they gain
greater honour and glory with the Lord; but if they marry, they do not
sin. <span id="fr_178"></span>[179](#fn_178.md) Guard, therefore, your
chastity and purity, and you will live to God. What commandments I now
give you, and what I am to give, keep from henceforth, yea, from the
very day when you were entrusted to me, and I will dwell in your house.
And your former sins will be forgiven, if you keep my commandments. And
all shall be forgiven who keep these my commandments, and walk in this
chastity.”

<span id="ii.iii.iv-p3"></span> *Questions.* “I charge you,” said he,
“to guard your chastity, and let no thought enter your heart of another
man’s marriage (i.e., wife), or of fornication, for this produces a
great transgression. But be always mindful of the Lord at all hours, and
you will never sin. For if this very wicked thought enter your heart,
you commit a great sin, and they who practice such deeds follow the way
of death. Take heed, therefore, and refrain from this thought. For where
chastity remains in the heart of a righteous man, never ought there to
arise any evil thought.” I said to him,” Sir, permit me to say a few
words to you.” “Say on,” said he.—*Vat*.

True penitence is a habit of life. An apparent safe-guard against the
reproaches of Montanism, and a caution not to turn forgiveness into a
momentary sponge without avoiding renewed transgression.\]

heal, will provide a remedy.—*Vat*. \[This whole passage seems to refer
to the separation of penitents under canonical discipline. Tertullian,

<span id="ii.iii.iv-p15"></span> *For … them.* Since God knows the
thoughts of all hearts, and the weakness of men, and the manifold
wickedness of the devil which he practices in plotting against the
servants of God, and in malignant designs against them.—*Vat.*

<span id="ii.iii.iv-p16"></span> *In … life.* These words occur only in
Pal. \[Can the following words be genuine? They reflect the very
Montanism here so strictly opposed. Wake has followed a very different
text. The Scriptures, it is true, use very awful language of the same
kind: [Heb. 10:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#026.md),
