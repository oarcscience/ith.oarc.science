##### <span id="v.ii.xxxi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXI.—Confutation of the Other Charges Brought Against the Christians.

<span id="v.ii.xxxi-p1"></span>But they have further also made up
stories against us of impious feasts <span
id="fr_817"></span>[818](#fn_817.md) and forbidden intercourse between the
sexes, both that they may appear to themselves to have rational grounds
of hatred, and because they think either by fear to lead us away from
our way of life, or to render the rulers harsh and inexorable by the
magnitude of the charges they bring. But they lose their labour with
those who know that from of old it has been the custom, and not in our
time only, for vice to make war on virtue. Thus Pythagoras, with three
hundred others, was burnt to death; Heraclitus and Democritus were
banished, the one from the city of the Ephesians, the other from Abdera,
because he was charged with being mad; and the Athenians condemned
Socrates to death. But as they were none the worse in respect of virtue
because of the opinion of the multitude, so neither does the
undiscriminating calumny of some persons cast any shade upon us as
regards rectitude of life, for with God we stand in good repute.
Nevertheless, I will meet these charges also, although I am well assured
that by what has been already said I have cleared myself to you. For as
you excel all men in intelligence, you know that those whose life is
directed towards God as its rule, so that each one among <span
id="page_146">p. 146</span> <span id="v.ii.xxxi-Page_146"></span>us may
be blameless and irreproachable before Him, will not entertain even the
thought of the slightest sin. For if we believed that we should live
only the present life, then we might be suspected of sinning, through
being enslaved to flesh and blood, or overmastered by gain or carnal
desire; but since we know that God is witness to what we think and what
we say both by night and by day, and that He, being Himself light, sees
all things in our heart, we are persuaded that when we are removed from
the present life we shall live another life, better than the present
one, and heavenly, not earthly (since we shall abide near God, and with
God, free from all change or suffering in the soul, not as flesh, even
though we shall have flesh, <span id="fr_818"></span>[819](#fn_818.md) but
as heavenly spirit), or, falling with the rest, a worse one and in fire;
for God has not made us as sheep or beasts of burden, a mere by-work,
and that we should perish and be annihilated. On these grounds it is not
likely that we should wish to do evil, or deliver ourselves over to the
great Judge to be punished.

a charge which the Christian Fathers perpetually repel. Of course the
sacrament of the Lord’s Supper lent colour to this charge; but it could
not have been repelled, had they believed the material body and blood of
the “man Christ Jesus,” present in this sacrament. See cap. iii.,
note.\]
