##### <span id="vi.iii.iii.i-p0.1"></span>Chapter I.—On the True Beauty.

<span id="vi.iii.iii.i-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="vi.iii.iii.i-p1.1"></span>It</span> is then, as appears, the
greatest of all lessons to know one’s self. For if one knows himself, he
will know God; and knowing God, he will be made like God, not by wearing
gold or long robes, but by well-doing, and by requiring as few things as
possible. <span id="fr_1573"></span>[1574](#fn_1573.md)

<span id="vi.iii.iii.i-p3"></span>Now, God alone is in need of nothing,
and rejoices most when He sees us bright with the ornament of
intelligence; and then, too, rejoices in him who is arrayed in chastity,
the sacred stole of the body. Since then the soul consists of three
divisions; <span id="fr_1574"></span>[1575](#fn_1574.md) the intellect,
which is called the reasoning faculty, is the inner man, which is the
ruler of this man that is seen. And that one, in another respect, God
guides. But the irascible part, being brutal, dwells near to insanity.
And appetite, which is the third department, is many-shaped above
Proteus, the varying sea-god, who changed himself now into one shape,
now into another; and it allures to adulteries, to licentiousness, to
seductions.

> <span id="vi.iii.iii.i-p4.4"></span> “At first he was a lion with
> ample beard.” <span id="fr_1575"></span>[1576](#fn_1575.md)  

<span id="vi.iii.iii.i-p6"></span>While he yet retained the ornament,
the hair of the chin showed him to be a man.

> <span id="vi.iii.iii.i-p6.1"></span> “But after that a serpent, a
> pard, or a big sow.”  

<span id="vi.iii.iii.i-p7"></span>Love of ornament has degenerated to
wantonness. A man no longer appears like a strong wild beast,

> <span id="vi.iii.iii.i-p7.1"></span> “But he became moist water, and a
> tree of lofty branches.”  

<span id="vi.iii.iii.i-p8"></span>Passions break out, pleasures
overflow; beauty fades, and falls quicker than the leaf on the ground,
when the amorous storms of lust blow on it before the coming of autumn,
and is withered by destruction. For lust becomes and fabricates all
things, and wishes to cheat, so as to conceal the man. But that man with
whom the Word dwells does not alter himself, does not get himself up: he
has the form which is of the Word; he is made like to God; he is
beautiful; he does not ornament himself: his is beauty, the true beauty,
for it is God; and that man becomes God, since God so wills. Heraclitus,
then, rightly said, “Men are gods, and gods are men.” For the Word
Himself is the manifest mystery: God in man, and man God. And the
Mediator executes the Father’s will; for the Mediator is the Word, who
is common to both—the Son of God, the Saviour of men; His Servant, our
Teacher. And the flesh being a slave, as Paul testifies, how can one
with any reason adorn the handmaid like a pimp? For that which is of
flesh has the form of a servant. Paul says, speaking of the Lord,
“Because He emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant,” <span
id="fr_1576"></span>[1577](#fn_1576.md) calling the outward man servant,
previous to the Lord becoming a servant and wearing flesh. But the
compassionate God Himself set the flesh free, and releasing it from
destruction, and from bitter and deadly bondage, endowed it with
incorruptibility, arraying the flesh in this, the holy embellishment of
eternity—immortality.

<span id="vi.iii.iii.i-p10"></span>There is, too, another beauty of
men—love. “And love,” according to the apostle, “suffers long, and is
kind; envieth not; vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up.” <span
id="fr_1577"></span>[1578](#fn_1577.md) For the decking of one’s self
out—carrying, as it does, the look of superfluity and uselessness—is
vaunting one’s self. Wherefore he adds, “doth not behave itself
unseemly:” for a figure which is not one’s own, and is against nature,
is unseemly; but what is artificial is not one’s own, as is clearly
explained: “seeketh not,” it is said, “what is not her own.” For truth
calls that its own which belongs to it; but the love of finery seeks
what is not its own, being apart from God, and the Word, from love.

<span id="page_272">p. 272</span> <span
id="vi.iii.iii.i-Page_272"></span>

<span id="vi.iii.iii.i-p12"></span>And that the Lord Himself was
uncomely in aspect, the Spirit testifies by Esaias: “And we saw Him, and
He had no form nor comeliness but His form was mean, inferior to
men.” <span id="fr_1578"></span>[1579](#fn_1578.md) Yet who was more
admirable than the Lord? But it was not the beauty of the flesh visible
to the eye, but the true beauty of both soul and body, which He
exhibited, which in the former is beneficence; in the latter—that is,
the flesh—immortality.
