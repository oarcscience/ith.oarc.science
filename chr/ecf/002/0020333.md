##### <span id="vi.iv.ii.ix-p0.1"></span>Chapter IX.—The Connection of the Christian Virtues.

<span id="vi.iv.ii.ix-p1"></span>Such a fear, accordingly, leads to
repentance and hope. Now hope is the expectation of good things, or an
expectation sanguine of absent <span id="page_357">p. 357</span> <span
id="vi.iv.ii.ix-Page_357"></span>good; and favourable circumstances are
assumed in order to good hope, which we have learned leads on to love.
Now love turns out to be consent in what pertains to reason, life, and
manners, or in brief, fellowship in life, or it is the intensity of
friendship and of affection, with right reason, in the enjoyment of
associates. And an associate (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.ii.ix-p1.1"></span>ἑταῖρος</span>) is another self; <span
id="fr_2242"></span>[2243](#fn_2242) just as we call those, brethren,
who are regenerated by the same word. And akin to love is hospitality,
being a congenial art devoted to the treatment of strangers. And those
are strangers, to whom the things of the world are strange. For we
regard as worldly those, who hope in the earth and carnal lusts. “Be not
conformed,” says the apostle, “to this world: but be ye transformed in
the renewal of the mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and
acceptable, and perfect, will of God.” <span
id="fr_2243"></span>[2244](#fn_2243)

<span id="vi.iv.ii.ix-p4"></span>Hospitality, therefore, is occupied in
what is useful for strangers; and guests (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.ii.ix-p4.1"></span>ἐπίξενοι</span>) are strangers (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.iv.ii.ix-p4.2"></span>ξένοι</span>); and
friends are guests; and brethren are friends. “Dear brother,” <span
id="fr_2244"></span>[2245](#fn_2244) says Homer.

<span id="vi.iv.ii.ix-p6"></span>Philanthropy, in order to which also,
is natural affection, being a loving treatment of men, and natural
affection, which is a congenial habit exercised in the love of friends
or domestics, follow in the train of love. And if the real man within us
is the spiritual, philanthropy is brotherly love to those who
participate, in the same spirit. Natural affection, on the other hand,
is the preservation of good-will, or of affection; and affection is its
perfect demonstration; <span id="fr_2245"></span>[2246](#fn_2245) and to
be beloved is to please in behaviour, by drawing and attracting. And
persons are brought to sameness by consent, which is the knowledge of
the good things that are enjoyed in common. For community of sentiment
(<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.ii.ix-p7.3"></span>ὁμογνωμοσύνη</span>) is harmony of opinions
(<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.iv.ii.ix-p7.4"></span>συμφωνία
γνωμῶν</span>). “Let your love be without dissimulation,” it is said;
“and abhorring what is evil, let us become attached to what is good, to
brotherly love,” and so on, down to “If it be possible, as much as lieth
in you, living peaceably with all men.” Then “be not overcome of evil,”
it is said, “but overcome evil with good.” <span
id="fr_2246"></span>[2247](#fn_2246) And the same apostle owns that he
bears witness to the Jews, “that they have a zeal of God, but not
according to knowledge. For, being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and
seeking to establish their own, they have not submitted themselves to
the righteousness of God.” <span id="fr_2247"></span>[2248](#fn_2247)
For they did not know and do the will of the law; but what they
supposed, that they thought the law wished. And they did not believe the
law as prophesying, but the bare word; and they followed through fear,
not through disposition and faith. “For Christ is the end of the law for
righteousness,” <span id="fr_2248"></span>[2249](#fn_2248) who was
prophesied by the law to every one that believeth. Whence it was said to
them by Moses, “I will provoke you to jealousy by them that are not a
people; and I will anger you by a foolish nation, that is, by one that
has become disposed to obedience.” <span
id="fr_2249"></span>[2250](#fn_2249) And by Isaiah it is said, “I was
found of them that sought Me not; I was made manifest to them that
inquired not after Me,” <span id="fr_2250"></span>[2251](#fn_2250)
—manifestly previous to the coming of the Lord; after which to Israel,
the things prophesied, are now appropriately spoken: “I have stretched
out My hands all the day long to a disobedient and gainsaying people.”
Do you see the cause of the calling from among the nations, clearly
declared, by the prophet, to be the disobedience and gainsaying of the
people? Then the goodness of God is shown also in their case. For the
apostle says, “But through their transgression salvation is come to the
Gentiles, to provoke them to jealousy” <span
id="fr_2251"></span>[2252](#fn_2251) and to willingness to repent. And
the Shepherd, speaking plainly of those who had fallen asleep,
recognises certain righteous among Gentiles and Jews, not only before
the appearance of Christ, but before the law, in virtue of acceptance
before God,—as Abel, as Noah, as any other righteous man. He says
accordingly, “that the apostles and teachers, who had preached the name
of the Son of God, and had fallen asleep, in power and by faith,
preached to those that had fallen asleep before” Then he subjoins: “And
they gave them the seal of preaching. They descended, therefore, with
them into the water, and again ascended. But these descended alive, and
again ascended alive. But those, who had fallen asleep before, descended
dead, but ascended alive. By these, therefore, they were made alive, and
knew the name of the Son of God. Wherefore also they ascended with them,
and fitted into the structure of the tower, and unhewn were built up
together; they fell asleep in righteousness and in great purity, but
wanted only this seal.” <span id="fr_2252"></span>[2253](#fn_2252) “For
when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things of
the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves,” <span
id="fr_2253"></span>[2254](#fn_2253) according to the apostle.

<span id="vi.iv.ii.ix-p16"></span>As, then, the virtues follow one
another, why need I say what has been demonstrated already, that faith
hopes through repentance, and fear through faith; and patience and
practice in these along with learning terminate in love, <span
id="page_358">p. 358</span> <span id="vi.iv.ii.ix-Page_358"></span>which
is perfected by knowledge? But that is necessarily to be noticed, that
the Divine alone is to be regarded as naturally wise. Therefore also
wisdom, which has taught the truth, is the power of God; and in it the
perfection of knowledge is embraced. The philosopher loves and likes the
truth, being now considered as a friend, on account of his love, from
his being a true servant. The beginning of knowledge is wondering at
objects, as Plato says is in his *Theætetus;* and Matthew exhorting in
the *Traditions*, says, “Wonder at what is before you;” laying this down
first as the foundation of further knowledge. So also in the Gospel to
the Hebrews it is written, “He that wonders shall reign, and he that has
reigned shall rest. It is impossible, therefore, for an ignorant man,
while he remains ignorant, to philosophize, not having apprehended the
idea of wisdom; since philosophy is an effort to grasp that which truly
is, and the studies that conduce thereto. And it is not the rendering of
one <span id="fr_2254"></span>[2255](#fn_2254) accomplished in good
habits of conduct, but the knowing how we are to use and act and labour,
according as one is assimilated to God. I mean God the Saviour, by
serving the God of the universe through the High Priest, the Word, by
whom what is in truth good and right is beheld. Piety is conduct
suitable and corresponding to God.
