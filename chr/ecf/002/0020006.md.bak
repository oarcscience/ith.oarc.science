#### <span id="ii.ii.iii-p0.1"></span>Vision Third.

##### <span id="ii.ii.iii-p0.2"></span>Concerning the Building of the Triumphant Church, and the Various Classes of Reprobate Men.

##### <span id="ii.ii.iii-p0.3"></span>Chap. I.

<span id="ii.ii.iii-p1"></span>The vision which I saw, my brethren, was
of the following nature. Having fasted frequently, and having prayed to
the Lord that He would show me the revelation which He promised to show
me through that old woman, the same night that old woman appeared to me,
and said to me, “Since you are so anxious and eager to know all things,
go into the part of the country where you tarry; and about the
fifth <span id="fr_78"></span>[79](#fn_78.md) hour I shall appear unto you,
and show you all that you ought to see.” I asked her, saying “Lady, into
what part of the country am I to go?” And she said, “Into any part you
wish.” Then I chose a spot which was suitable, and retired. Before,
however, I began to speak and to mention the place, she said to me, “I
will come where you wish.” Accordingly, I went to the country, and
counted the hours, and reached the place where I had promised to meet
her. And I see an ivory seat ready placed, and on it a linen cushion,
and above the linen cushion was spread a covering of fine linen. <span
id="fr_79"></span>[80](#fn_79.md) Seeing these laid out, and yet no one in
the place, I began to feel awe, and as it were a trembling seized hold
of me, and my hair stood on end, and as it were a horror came upon me
when I saw that I was all alone. But on coming back to myself and
calling to mind the glory of God, I took courage, bent my knees, and
again confessed my sins to God as I had done before. <span
id="fr_80"></span>[81](#fn_80.md) Whereupon the old woman approached,
accompanied by six young men whom I had also seen before; and she stood
behind me, and listened to me, as I prayed and confessed my sins to the
Lord. And touching me she said, “Hermas, cease praying continually for
your sins; pray for righteousness, <span id="fr_81"></span>[82](#fn_81.md)
that you may <span id="page_13">p. 13</span> <span
id="ii.ii.iii-Page_13"></span>have a portion of it immediately in your
house.” On this, she took me up by the hand, and brought me to the seat,
and said to the young men, “Go and build.” When the young men had gone
and we were alone, she said to me, “Sit here.” I say to her, “Lady,
permit my elders <span id="fr_82"></span>[83](#fn_82.md) to be seated
first.” “Do what I bid you,” said she; “sit down.” When I would have sat
down on her right, she did not permit me, but with her hand beckoned to
me to sit down on the left. While I was thinking about this, and feeling
vexed that she did not let me sit on the right, she said, “Are you
vexed, Hermas? The place to the right is for others who have already
pleased God, and have suffered for His name’s sake; and you have yet
much to accomplish before you can sit with them. But abide as you now do
in your simplicity, and you will sit with them, and with all who do
their deeds and bear what they have borne.”

##### <span id="ii.ii.iii-p6.1"></span>Chap. II.

<span id="ii.ii.iii-p7"></span>“What have they borne?” said I. “Listen,”
said she: “scourges, prisons, great tribulations, crosses, wild
beasts, <span id="fr_83"></span>[84](#fn_83.md) for God’s name’s sake. On
this account is assigned to them the division of sanctification on the
right hand, and to every one who shall suffer for God’s name: to the
rest is assigned the division on the left. But both for those who sit on
the right, and those who sit on the left, there are the same gifts and
promises; only those sit on the right, and have some glory. You then are
eager to sit on the right with them, but your shortcomings are many. But
you will be cleansed from your shortcomings; and all who are not given
to doubts shall be cleansed from all their iniquities up till this day.”
Saying this, she wished to go away. But falling down at her feet, I
begged her by the Lord that she would show me the vision which she had
promised to show me. And then she again took hold of me by the hand, and
raised me, and made me sit on the seat to the left; and lifting up a
splendid rod, <span id="fr_84"></span>[85](#fn_84.md) she said to me, “Do
you see something great?” And I say, “Lady, I see nothing.” She said to
me, “Lo! do you not see opposite to you a great tower, built upon the
waters, of splendid square stones?” For the tower was built square <span
id="fr_85"></span>[86](#fn_85.md) by those six young men who had come with
her. But myriads of men were carrying stones to it, some dragging them
from the depths, others removing them from the land, and they handed
them to these six young men. They were taking them and building; and
those of the stones that were dragged out of the depths, they placed in
the building just as they were: for they were polished and fitted
exactly into the other stones, and became so united one with another
that the lines of juncture could not be perceived. <span
id="fr_86"></span>[87](#fn_86.md) And in this way the building of the tower
looked as if it were made out of one stone. Those stones, however, which
were taken from the earth suffered a different fate; for the young men
rejected some of them, some they fitted into the building, and some they
cut down, and cast far away from the tower. Many other stones, however,
lay around the tower, and the young men did not use them in building;
for some of them were rough, others had cracks in them, others had been
made too short, <span id="fr_87"></span>[88](#fn_87.md) and others were
white and round, but did not fit into the building of the tower.
Moreover, I saw other stones thrown far away from the tower, and falling
into the public road; yet they did not remain on the road, but were
rolled into a pathless place. And I saw others falling into the fire and
burning, others falling close to the water, and yet not capable of being
rolled into the water, though they wished to be rolled down, and to
enter the water.

##### <span id="ii.ii.iii-p12.1"></span>Chap. III.

<span id="ii.ii.iii-p13"></span>On showing me these visions, she wished
to retire. I said to her, “What is the use of my having seen all this,
while I do not know what it means?” She said to me, “You are a cunning
fellow, wishing to know everything that relates to the tower.” “Even so,
O Lady,” said I, “that I may tell it to my brethren, that, hearing this,
they may know the Lord in much glory.” <span
id="fr_88"></span>[89](#fn_88.md) And she said, “Many indeed shall hear,
and hearing, some shall be glad, and some shall weep. But even these, if
they hear and repent, shall also rejoice. Hear, then, the parables of
the tower; for I will reveal all to you, and give me no more trouble in
regard to revelation: for these revelations have an end, for they have
been completed. But you will not cease praying for revelations, for you
are shameless. <span id="fr_89"></span>[90](#fn_89.md) The tower which you
see building is myself, the Church, who have appeared to you now and on
the former occasion. Ask, then, whatever you like in regard to the
tower, and I will reveal it to you, that you may rejoice with the
saints.” I said unto her, “Lady, since you have vouchsafed to reveal all
to me this once, reveal it.” She said to me, “Whatsoever ought to be
revealed, will be revealed; only let your heart be with God, <span
id="fr_90"></span>[91](#fn_90.md) and doubt not whatsoever you shall see.”
<span id="page_14">p. 14</span> <span id="ii.ii.iii-Page_14"></span>I
asked her, “Why was the tower built upon the waters, O Lady?” She
answered, “I told you before, <span id="fr_91"></span>[92](#fn_91.md) and
you still inquire carefully: therefore inquiring you shall find the
truth. Hear then why the tower is built upon the waters. It is because
your life has been, and will be, saved through water. For the tower was
founder on the word of the almighty and glorious Name and it is kept
together by the invisible power of the Lord.” <span
id="fr_92"></span>[93](#fn_92.md)

##### <span id="ii.ii.iii-p18.4"></span>Chap. IV.

<span id="ii.ii.iii-p19"></span>In reply I said to her, “This is
magnificent and marvellous. But who are the six young men who are
engaged in building?” And she said, “These are the holy angels of God,
who were first created, and to whom the Lord handed over His whole
creation, that they might increase and build up and rule over the whole
creation. By these will the building of the tower be finished.” “But who
are the other persons who are engaged in carrying the stones?” “These
also are holy angels of the Lord, but the former six are more excellent
than these. The building of the tower will be finished, <span
id="fr_93"></span>[94](#fn_93.md) and all will rejoice together around the
tower, and they will glorify God, because the tower is finished.” I
asked her, saying, “Lady, I should like to know what became of the
stones, and what was meant by the various kinds of stones?” In reply she
said to me, “Not because you are <span id="fr_94"></span>[95](#fn_94.md)
more deserving than all others that this revelation should be made to
you—for there are others before you, and better than you, to whom these
visions should have been revealed—but that the name of God may be
glorified, has the revelation been made to you, and it will be made on
account of the doubtful who ponder in their hearts whether these things
will be or not. Tell them that all these things are true, and that none
of them is beyond the truth. All of them are firm and sure, and
established on a strong foundation.”

##### <span id="ii.ii.iii-p21.2"></span>Chap. V.

<span id="ii.ii.iii-p22"></span>“Hear now with regard to the stones
which are in the building. Those square white stones which fitted
exactly into each other, are apostles, bishops, teachers, and deacons,
who have lived in godly purity, and have acted as bishops and teachers
and deacons chastely and reverently to the elect of God. Some of them
have fallen asleep, and some still remain alive. <span
id="fr_95"></span>[96](#fn_95.md) And they have always agreed with each
other, and been at peace among themselves, <span
id="fr_96"></span>[97](#fn_96.md) and listened to each other. On account of
this, they join exactly into the building of the tower.” “But who are
the stones that were dragged from the depths, and which were laid into
the building and fitted in with the rest of the stones previously placed
in the tower?” “They are those <span id="fr_97"></span>[98](#fn_97.md) who
suffered for the Lord’s sake.” “But I wish to know, O Lady, who are the
other stones which were carried from the land.” “Those,” she said,
“which go into the building without being polished, are those whom God
has approved of, for they walked in the straight ways of the Lord and
practiced His commandments.” “But who are those who are in the act of
being brought and placed in the building?” “They are those who are young
in faith and are faithful. But they are admonished by the angels to do
good, for no iniquity has been found in them.” “Who then are those whom
they rejected and cast away?” <span id="fr_98"></span>[99](#fn_98.md)
“These are they who have sinned, and wish to repent. On this account
they have not been thrown far from the tower, because they will yet be
useful in the building, if they repent. Those then who are to repent, if
they do repent, will be strong in faith, if they now repent while the
tower is building. For if the building be finished, there will not be
more room for any one, but he will be rejected. <span
id="fr_99"></span>[100](#fn_99.md) This privilege, however, will belong
only to him who has now been placed near the tower.”

##### <span id="ii.ii.iii-p27.2"></span>Chap. VI.

<span id="ii.ii.iii-p28"></span>“As to those who were cut down and
thrown far away from the tower, do you wish to know who they are? They
are the sons of iniquity, and they believed in hypocrisy, and wickedness
did not depart from them. For this reason they are not saved, since they
cannot be used in the building on account of their iniquities. Wherefore
they have been cut off and cast far away on account of the anger of the
Lord, for they have roused Him to anger. But I shall explain to you the
other stones which you saw lying in great numbers, and not going into
the building. Those which are rough are those who have known the truth
and not remained in it, nor have they been joined to the saints. <span
id="fr_100"></span>[101](#fn_100.md) On this account are they unfit for
use.” “Who are those that have rents?” “These are they who are at
discord in their hearts one with another, and are not at peace amongst
themselves: they indeed keep peace before each other, but when they
separate one from the other, their wicked thoughts remain in <span
id="page_15">p. 15</span> <span id="ii.ii.iii-Page_15"></span>their
hearts. These, then, are the rents which are in the stones. But those
which are shortened are those who have indeed believed, and have the
larger share of righteousness; yet they have also a considerable share
of iniquity, and therefore they are shortened and not whole.” “But who
are these, Lady, that are white and round, and yet do not fit into the
building of the tower?” She answered and said, “How long will you be
foolish and stupid, and continue to put every kind of question and
understand nothing? These are those who have faith indeed, but they have
also the riches of this world. When, therefore, tribulation comes, on
account of their riches and business they deny the Lord.” <span
id="fr_101"></span>[102](#fn_101.md) I answered and said to her, “When,
then, will they be useful for the building, Lady?” “When the riches that
now seduce them have been circumscribed, then will they be of use to
God. <span id="fr_102"></span>[103](#fn_102.md) For as a round stone cannot
become square unless portions be cut off and cast away, so also those
who are rich in this world cannot be useful to the Lord unless their
riches be cut down. Learn this first from your own case. When you were
rich, you were useless; but now you are useful and fit for life. Be ye
useful to God; for you also will be used as one of these stones.” <span
id="fr_103"></span>[104](#fn_103.md)

##### <span id="ii.ii.iii-p32.1"></span>Chap. VII.

<span id="ii.ii.iii-p33"></span>“Now the other stones which you saw cast
far away from the tower, and falling upon the public road and rolling
from it into pathless places, are those who have indeed believed, but
through doubt have abandoned the true road. Thinking, then, that they
could find a better, they wander and become wretched, and enter upon
pathless places. But those which fell into the fire and were
burned <span id="fr_104"></span>[105](#fn_104.md) are those who have
departed for ever from the living God; nor does the thought of
repentance ever come into their hearts, on account of their devotion to
their lusts and to the crimes which they committed. Do you wish to know
who are the others which fell near the waters, but could not be rolled
into them? These are they who have heard the word, and wish to be
baptized in the name of the Lord; but when the chastity demanded by the
truth comes into their recollection, they draw back, <span
id="fr_105"></span>[106](#fn_105.md) and again walk after their own wicked
desires.” She finished her exposition of the tower. But I, shameless as
I yet was, asked her, “Is repentance possible for all those stones which
have been cast away and did not fit into the building of the tower, and
will they yet have a place in this tower?” “Repentance,” said she, “is
yet possible, but in this tower they cannot find a suitable place. But
in another <span id="fr_106"></span>[107](#fn_106.md) and much inferior
place they will be laid, and that, too, only when they have been
tortured and completed the days of their sins. And on this account will
they be transferred, because they have partaken of the righteous
Word. <span id="fr_107"></span>[108](#fn_107.md) And then only will they be
removed from their punishments when the thought of repenting of the evil
deeds which they have done has come into their hearts. But if it does
not come into their hearts, they will not be saved, on account of the
hardness of their heart.”

##### <span id="ii.ii.iii-p37.5"></span>Chap. VIII.

<span id="ii.ii.iii-p38"></span>When then I ceased asking in regard to
all these matters, she said to me, “Do you wish to see anything else?”
And as I was extremely eager to see something more, my countenance
beamed with joy. She looked towards me with a smile, and said, “Do you
see seven women around the tower?” “I do, Lady,” said I. “This tower,”
said she, “is supported by them according to the precept of the Lord.
Listen now to their functions. The first of them, who is clasping her
hands, is called Faith. Through her the elect of God are saved. <span
id="fr_108"></span>[109](#fn_108.md) Another, who has her garments tucked
up <span id="fr_109"></span>[110](#fn_109.md) and acts with vigour, is
called Self-restraint. She is the daughter of Faith. Whoever then
follows her will become happy in his life, because he will restrain
himself from all evil works, believing that, if he restrain himself from
all evil desire, he will inherit eternal life.” “But the others,” said
I, “O Lady, who are they?” And she said to me, “They are daughters of
each other. One of them is called Simplicity, another Guilelessness,
another Chastity, another Intelligence, another Love. When then you do
all the works of their mother, <span id="fr_110"></span>[111](#fn_110.md)
you will be able to live.” “I should like to know,” said I, “O Lady,
what power each one of them possesses.” “Hear,” she said, “what power
they have. Their powers are regulated <span
id="fr_111"></span>[112](#fn_111.md) by each other, and follow each other
in the <span id="page_16">p. 16</span> <span
id="ii.ii.iii-Page_16"></span>order of their birth. For from Faith
arises Self-restraint; from Self-restraint, Simplicity; from Simplicity,
Guilelessness; from Guilelessness, Chastity; from Chastity,
Intelligence; and from Intelligence, Love. The deeds, then, of these are
pure, and chaste, and divine. Whoever devotes himself to these, and is
able to hold fast by their works, shall have his dwelling in the tower
with the saints of God.” Then I asked her in regard to the ages, if now
there is the conclusion. She cried out with a loud voice, “Foolish man!
do you not see the tower yet building? When the tower is finished and
built, then comes the end; and I assure you it will be soon finished.
Ask me no more questions. Let you and all the saints be content with
what I have called to your remembrance, and with my renewal of your
spirits. But observe that it is not for your own sake only that these
revelations have been made to you, but they have been given you that you
may show them to all. For <span id="fr_112"></span>[113](#fn_112.md) after
three days—this you will take care to remember—I Command you to speak
all the words which I am to say to you into the ears of the saints, that
hearing them and doing them, they may be cleansed from their iniquities,
and you along with them.”

##### <span id="ii.ii.iii-p43.1"></span>Chap. IX.

<span id="ii.ii.iii-p44"></span>Give ear unto me, O Sons: I have brought
you up in much simplicity, and guilelessness, and chastity, on account
of the mercy of the Lord, <span id="fr_113"></span>[114](#fn_113.md) who
has dropped His righteousness down upon you, that ye may be made
righteous and holy <span id="fr_114"></span>[115](#fn_114.md) from all your
iniquity and depravity; but you do not wish to rest from your iniquity.
Now, therefore, listen to me, and be at peace one with another, and
visit each other, and bear each other’s burdens, and do not partake of
God’s creatures alone, <span id="fr_115"></span>[116](#fn_115.md) but give
abundantly of them to the needy. For some through the abundance of their
food produce weakness in their flesh, and thus corrupt their flesh;
while the flesh of others who have no food is corrupted, because they
have not sufficient nourishment. And on this account their bodies waste
away. This intemperance in eating is thus injurious to you who have
abundance and do not distribute among those who are needy. Give heed to
the judgment that is to come. Ye, therefore, who are high in position,
seek out the hungry as long as the tower is not yet finished; for after
the tower is finished, you will wish to do good, but will find no
opportunity. Give heed, therefore, ye who glory in your wealth, lest
those who are needy should groan, and their groans should ascend to the
Lord, <span id="fr_116"></span>[117](#fn_116.md) and ye be shut out with
all your goods beyond the gate of the tower. Wherefore I now say to you
who preside over the Church and love the first seats, <span
id="fr_117"></span>[118](#fn_117.md) “Be not like to drug-mixers. For the
drug-mixers carry their drugs in boxes, but ye carry your drug and
poison in your heart. Ye are hardened, and do not wish to cleanse your
hearts, and to add unity of aim to purity of heart, that you may have
mercy from the great King. Take heed, therefore, children, that these
dissensions of yours do not deprive you of your life. How will you
instruct the elect of the Lord, if you yourselves have not instruction?
Instruct each other therefore, and be at peace among yourselves,
that <span id="fr_118"></span>[119](#fn_118.md) I also, standing joyful
before your Father, may give an account of you all to your Lord.” <span
id="fr_119"></span>[120](#fn_119.md)

##### <span id="ii.ii.iii-p51.2"></span>Chap. X.

<span id="ii.ii.iii-p52"></span>On her ceasing to speak to me, those six
young men who were engaged in building came and conveyed her to the
tower, and other four lifted up the seat and carried it also to the
tower. The faces of these last I did not see, for they were turned away
from me. And as she was going, I asked her to reveal to me the meaning
of the three forms in which she appeared to me. In reply she said to me:
“With regard to them, you must ask another to reveal their meaning to
you.” For she had appeared to me, brethren, in the first vision the
previous year under the form of an exceedingly old woman, sitting in a
chair. In the second vision her face was youthful, but her skin and hair
betokened age, and she stood while she spoke to me. She was also more
joyful than on the first occasion. But in the third vision she was
entirely youthful and exquisitely beautiful, except only that she had
the hair of an old woman; but her face beamed with joy, and she sat on a
seat. Now I was exceeding sad in regard to these appearances, for I
longed much to know what the visions meant. Then I see the old woman in
a vision of the night saying unto me: “Every prayer should be
accompanied with humility: fast, <span id="fr_120"></span>[121](#fn_120.md)
therefore, and you will obtain from the Lord what you beg.” I fasted
therefore for one day.

<span id="ii.ii.iii-p54"></span>That very night there appeared to me a
young man, who said, “Why do you frequently ask revelations in prayer?
Take heed lest by asking many things you injure your flesh: be content
<span id="page_17">p. 17</span> <span id="ii.ii.iii-Page_17"></span>with
these revelations. Will you be able to see greater <span
id="fr_121"></span>[122](#fn_121.md) revelations than those which you have
seen?” I answered and said to him, “Sir, one thing only I ask, that in
regard to these three forms the revelation may be rendered complete.” He
answered me, “How long are ye senseless? <span
id="fr_122"></span>[123](#fn_122.md) But your doubts make you senseless,
because you have not your hearts turned towards the Lord.” But I
answered and said to him, “From you, sir, we shall learn these things
more accurately.”

##### <span id="ii.ii.iii-p56.3"></span>Chap. XI.

<span id="ii.ii.iii-p57"></span>“Hear then,” said he, “with regard to
the three forms, concerning which you are inquiring. Why in the first
vision did she appear to you as an old woman seated on a chair? Because
your spirit is now old and withered up, and has lost its power in
consequence of your infirmities and doubts. For, like elderly men who
have no hope of renewing their strength, and expect nothing but their
last sleep, so you, weakened by worldly occupations, have given
yourselves up to sloth, and have not cast your cares upon the
Lord. <span id="fr_123"></span>[124](#fn_123.md) Your spirit therefore is
broken, and you have grown old in your sorrows.” “I should like then to
know, sir, why she sat on a chair?” He answered, “Because every weak
person sits on a chair on account of his weakness, that his weakness may
be sustained. Lo! you have the form of the first vision.”

##### <span id="ii.ii.iii-p58.2"></span>Chap. XII.

<span id="ii.ii.iii-p59"></span>“Now in the second vision you saw her
standing with a youthful countenance, and more joyful than before; still
she had the skin and hair of an aged woman. Hear,” said he, “this
parable also. When one becomes somewhat old, he despairs of himself on
account of his weakness and poverty, and looks forward to nothing but
the last day of his life. Then suddenly an inheritance is left him: and
hearing of this, he rises up, and becoming exceeding joyful, he puts on
strength. And now he no longer reclines, but stands up; and his spirit,
already destroyed by his previous actions, is renewed, <span
id="fr_124"></span>[125](#fn_124.md) and he no longer sits, but acts with
vigour. So happened it with you on hearing the revelation which God gave
you. For the Lord had compassion on you, and renewed your spirit, and ye
laid aside your infirmities. Vigour arose within you, and ye grew strong
in faith; and the Lord, <span id="fr_125"></span>[126](#fn_125.md) seeing
your strength, rejoiced. On this account He showed you the building of
the tower; and He will show you other things, if you continue at peace
with each other with all your heart.”

##### <span id="ii.ii.iii-p61.1"></span>Chap. XIII.

<span id="ii.ii.iii-p62"></span>“Now, in the third vision, you saw her
still younger, and she was noble and joyful, and her shape was
beautiful. <span id="fr_126"></span>[127](#fn_126.md) For, just as when
some good news comes suddenly to one who is sad, immediately he forgets
his former sorrows, and looks for nothing else than the good news which
he has heard, and for the future is made strong for good, and his spirit
is renewed on account of the joy which he has received; so ye also have
received the renewal of your spirits by seeing these good things. As to
your seeing her sitting on a seat, that means that her position is one
of strength, for a seat has four feet and stands firmly. For the world
also is kept together by means of four elements. Those, therefore, who
repent completely and with the whole heart, will become young and firmly
established. You now have the revelation completely given you. <span
id="fr_127"></span>[128](#fn_127.md) Make no further demands for
revelations. If anything ought to be revealed, it will be revealed to
you.”
