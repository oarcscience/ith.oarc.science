##### <span id="vi.iii.i.x-p0.1"></span>Chapter X.—That the Same God, by the Same Word, Restrains from Sin by Threatening, and Saves Humanity by Exhorting.

<span id="vi.iii.i.x-p1"></span>If, then, we have shown that the plan of
dealing stringently with humanity is good and salutary, and necessarily
adopted by the Word, and conducive to repentance and the prevention of
sins; we shall have now to look in order at the mildness of the Word.
For He has been demonstrated to be just. He sets before us His own
inclinations which invite to salvation; by which, in accordance with the
Father’s will, He wishes to make known to us the good and the useful.
Consider these. The good (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iii.i.x-p1.1"></span>τὸ καλόν</span>) belongs to the panegyrical
form of speech, the useful to the persuasive. For the hortatory and the
dehortatory are a form of the persuasive, and the laudatory and
inculpatory of the panegyrical.

<span id="vi.iii.i.x-p2"></span>For the persuasive style of sentence in
one form becomes hortatory, and in another dehortatory. So also the
panegyrical in one form becomes inculpatory, and in another laudatory.
And in these exercises the Instructor, the Just One, who has proposed
our advantage as His aim, is chiefly occupied. But the inculpatory and
dehortatory forms of speech have been already shown us; and we must now
handle the persuasive and the laudatory, and, as on a beam, balance the
equal scales of justice. The exhortation to what is useful, the
Instructor employs by Solomon, to the following effect: “I exhort you, O
men; and I utter my voice to the sons of men. Hear me; for I will speak
of excellent things;” <span id="fr_1267"></span>[1268](#fn_1267.md) and so
on. And He counsels what is salutary: for counsel has for its end,
choosing or refusing a certain course; as He does by David, when He
says, “Blessed is the man who walketh not in the counsels of the
ungodly, and standeth not in the way of sinners, and sitteth not in the
chair of pestilences; but his will is in the law of the <span
class="sc"><span id="vi.iii.i.x-p3.2"></span>Lord</span>.” <span
id="fr_1268"></span>[1269](#fn_1268.md) And there are three departments of
counsel: That which takes examples from past times; as what the Hebrews
suffered when they worshipped the golden calf, and what they suffered
when they committed fornication, and the like. The second, whose meaning
is understood from the present times, as being apprehended by
perception; as it was said to those who asked the Lord, “If He was the
Christ, or shall we wait for another? Go and tell John, the blind
receive their sight, the deaf hear, the lepers are cleansed, the dead
are raised up; and blessed is he who shall not be offended in Me.” <span
id="fr_1269"></span>[1270](#fn_1269.md) Such was that which David said when
he prophesied, “As we have heard, so have we seen.” <span
id="fr_1270"></span>[1271](#fn_1270.md) And the third department of counsel
consists of what is future, by which we are bidden guard against what is
to happen; as also that was said, “They that fall into sins shall be
cast into outer darkness, where there shall be wailing and gnashing of
teeth,” <span id="fr_1271"></span>[1272](#fn_1271.md) and the like. So that
from these things it is clear that the Lord, going the round of all the
methods of curative treatment, calls humanity to salvation.

<span id="vi.iii.i.x-p8"></span>By encouragement He assuages sins,
reducing lust, and at the same time inspiring hope for salvation. For He
says by Ezekiel, “If ye return with your whole heart, and say, Father, I
will hear you, as a holy people.” <span
id="fr_1272"></span>[1273](#fn_1272.md) And again He says, “Come all to Me,
who labour, and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest;” <span
id="fr_1273"></span>[1274](#fn_1273.md) and that which is added the Lord
speaks in His own person. And very clearly He calls to goodness by
Solomon, when He says, “Blessed is the man who hath found wisdom, and
the mortal who hath found understanding.” <span
id="fr_1274"></span>[1275](#fn_1274.md) “For the good is found by him who
seeks it, and is wont to be seen by him who has found it.” <span
id="fr_1275"></span>[1276](#fn_1275.md) By Jeremiah, too, He sets forth
prudence, when he says, “Blessed are we, Israel; for what is pleasing to
God is known by us; <span id="fr_1276"></span>[1277](#fn_1276.md) —and it
is known by the Word, by whom we are blessed and wise. For wisdom and
knowledge are mentioned by the same prophet, when he says, “Hear, O
Israel, the commandments of life, and give ear to know
understanding.” <span id="fr_1277"></span>[1278](#fn_1277.md) By Moses,
too, by reason of the love He has to man, He promises a gift to those
who hasten to salvation. For He says, “And I will bring you into the
good land, <span id="page_233">p. 233</span> <span
id="vi.iii.i.x-Page_233"></span>which the Lord sware to your
fathers.” <span id="fr_1278"></span>[1279](#fn_1278.md) And further, “And I
will bring you into the holy mountain, and make you glad,” <span
id="fr_1279"></span>[1280](#fn_1279.md) He says by Isaiah. And still
another form of instruction is benediction. “And blessed is he,” He
saith by David, “who has not sinned; and he shall be as the tree planted
near the channels of the waters, which will yield its fruit in its
season, and his leaf shall not wither” <span
id="fr_1280"></span>[1281](#fn_1280.md) (by this He made an allusion to the
resurrection); “and whatsoever he shall do shall prosper with him.” Such
He wishes us to be, that we may be blessed. Again, showing the opposite
scale of the balance of justice, He says, “But not so the ungodly—not
so; but as the dust which the wind sweeps away from the face of the
earth.” <span id="fr_1281"></span>[1282](#fn_1281.md) By showing the
punishment of sinners, and their easy dispersion, and carrying off by
the wind, the Instructor dissuades from crime by means of punishment;
and by holding up the merited penalty, shows the benignity of His
beneficence in the most skilful way, in order that we may possess and
enjoy its blessings. He invites us to knowledge also, when He says by
Jeremiah, “Hadst thou walked in the way of God, thou wouldst have dwelt
for ever in peace;” <span id="fr_1282"></span>[1283](#fn_1282.md) for,
exhibiting there the reward of knowledge, He calls the wise to the love
of it. And, granting pardon to him who has erred, He says, “Turn, turn,
as a grape-gatherer to his basket.” <span
id="fr_1283"></span>[1284](#fn_1283.md) Do you see the goodness of justice,
in that it counsels to repentance? And still further, by Jeremiah, He
enlightens in the truth those who have erred. “Thus saith the <span
class="sc"><span id="vi.iii.i.x-p20.2"></span>Lord</span>, Stand in the
ways, and look, and ask for the eternal paths of the Lord, what is the
good path, and walk in it, and ye shall find purification for your
souls.” <span id="fr_1284"></span>[1285](#fn_1284.md) And in order to
promote our salvation, He leads us to repentance. Wherefore He says, “If
thou repent, the <span class="sc"><span
id="vi.iii.i.x-p21.2"></span>Lord</span> will purify thy heart, and the
heart of thy seed.” <span id="fr_1285"></span>[1286](#fn_1285.md) We might
have adduced, as supporters on this question, the philosophers who say
that only the perfect man is worthy of praise, and the bad man of blame.
But since some slander beatitude, as neither itself taking any trouble,
nor giving any to any one else, thus not understanding its love to man;
on their account, and on account of those who do not associate justice
with goodness, the following remarks are added. For it were a legitimate
inference to say, that rebuke and censure are suitable to men, since
they say that all men are bad; but God alone is wise, from whom cometh
wisdom, and alone perfect, and therefore alone worthy of praise. But I
do not employ such language. I say, then, that praise or blame, or
whatever resembles praise or blame, are medicines most essential of all
to men. Some are ill to cure, and, like iron, are wrought into shape
with fire, and hammer, and anvil, that is, with threatening, and
reproof, and chastisement; while others, cleaving to faith itself, as
self-taught, and as acting of their own free-will, grow by praise:—

> <span id="vi.iii.i.x-p22.2"></span> “For virtue that is praised  
> Grows like a tree.”  

<span id="vi.iii.i.x-p23"></span>And comprehending this, as it seems to
me, the Samian Pythagoras gives the injunction:—

> <span id="vi.iii.i.x-p23.1"></span> “When you have done base things,
> rebuke *yourself;*  
> But when you have done good things, be glad.”  

<span id="vi.iii.i.x-p24"></span>Chiding is also called admonishing; and
the etymology of admonishing (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iii.i.x-p24.1"></span>νουθέτησις</span>) is (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.iii.i.x-p24.2"></span>νοῦ
ἐνθεματισμός</span>) putting of understanding into one; so that rebuking
is bringing one to one’s senses.

<span id="vi.iii.i.x-p25"></span>But there are myriads of injunctions to
be found, whose aim is the attainment of what is good, and the avoidance
of what is evil. “For there is no peace to the wicked, saith the <span
class="sc"><span id="vi.iii.i.x-p25.1"></span>Lord</span>.” <span
id="fr_1286"></span>[1287](#fn_1286.md) Wherefore by Solomon He commands
the children to beware: “My son, let not sinners deceive thee, and go
not after their ways; and go not, if they entice thee, saying, Come with
us, share with us in innocent blood, and let us hide unjustly the
righteous man in the earth; let us put him out of sight, all alive as he
is into Hades.” <span id="fr_1287"></span>[1288](#fn_1287.md) This is
accordingly likewise a prediction concerning the Lord’s passion. And by
Ezekiel, the life supplies commandments: “The soul that sinneth shall
die; but he that doeth righteousness shall be righteous. He eateth not
upon the mountains, and hath not set his eyes on the devices of the
house of Israel, and will not defile his neighbour’s wife, and will not
approach to a woman in her separation, and will not oppress a man, and
will restore the debtor’s pledge, and will not take plunder: he will
give his bread to the hungry, and clothe the naked. His money he will
not give on usury, and will not take interest; and he will turn away his
hand from wrong, and will execute righteous judgment between a man and
his neighbour. He has walked in my statutes, and kept my judgments to do
them. This is a righteous man. He shall surely live, saith the
Lord.” <span id="fr_1288"></span>[1289](#fn_1288.md) These words contain a
description of the conduct of Christians, a notable exhortation to the
blessed life, which is the reward of a life of goodness—everlasting
life.
