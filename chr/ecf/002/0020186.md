##### <span id="v.ii.xvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVI.—The Christians Do Not Worship the Universe.

<span id="v.ii.xvi-p1"></span>Beautiful without doubt is the world,
excelling, <span id="fr_741"></span>[742](#fn_741.md) as well in its
magnitude as in the arrangement of its parts, both those in the oblique
circle and those about the north, and also in its spherical form. <span
id="fr_742"></span>[743](#fn_742.md) Yet it is not this, but its Artificer,
that we must worship. For when any of your subjects come to you, they do
not neglect to pay their homage to you, their rulers and lords, from
whom they will obtain whatever they need, and address themselves to the
magnificence of your palace; but, if they chance to come upon the royal
residence, they bestow a passing glance of admiration on its beautiful
structure: but it is to you yourselves that they show honour, as being
“all in all.” You sovereigns, indeed, rear and adorn your palaces for
yourselves; but the world was not created because God needed it; for God
is Himself everything to Himself,—light unapproachable, a perfect world,
spirit, power, reason. If, therefore, the world is an instrument in
tune, and moving in well-measured time, I adore the Being who gave its
harmony, and strikes its notes, and sings the accordant strain, and not
the instrument. For at the musical contests the adjudicators do not pass
by the lute-players and crown the lutes. Whether, then, as Plato says,
the world be a product of divine art, I admire its beauty, and adore the
Artificer; or whether it be His essence and body, as the Peripatetics
affirm, we do not neglect to adore God, who is the cause of the motion
of the body, and descend “to the poor and weak elements,” adoring in the
impassible <span id="fr_743"></span>[744](#fn_743.md) air (as they term
it), passible matter; or, if any one apprehends the several parts of the
world to be powers of God, we do not approach and do homage to the
powers, but their Maker and Lord. I do not ask of matter what it has not
to give, nor passing God by do I pay homage to the elements, which can
do nothing more than what they were bidden; for, although they are
beautiful to look upon, by reason of the art of their Framer, yet they
still have the nature of matter. And to this view Plato also bears
testimony; “for,” says he, “that which is called heaven and earth has
received many blessings from the Father, but yet partakes of body; hence
it cannot possibly be free from change.” <span
id="fr_744"></span>[745](#fn_744.md) If, therefore, while I admire the
heavens and the elements in respect of their art, I do not worship them
as gods, knowing that the law of dissolution is upon them, how can I
call those objects gods of which I know the makers to be men? Attend, I
beg, to a few words on this subject.

<span id="v.ii.xvi-p3"></span> \[The Ptolemaic universe is conceived of
as a sort of hollow ball, or bubble, within which are the spheres moving
about the earth. Milton adopts from Homer the idea of such a globe, or
bubble, hanging by a chain from heaven (*Paradise Lost*, ii. 10, 51).
The oblique circle is the zodiac. The *Septentriones* are referred to
also. See *Paradise Lost*, viii. 65–168.\]
