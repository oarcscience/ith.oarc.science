##  Book V.

The following are the contents of the fifth book of the *Refutation of
all Heresies*:<sup>[1](footnote/fn9.md)</sup> -

What the assertions are of the Naasseni, who style themselves Gnostics,
and that they advance those opinions which the Philosophers of the
Greeks previously propounded, as well as those who have handed down
mystical (rites), from (both of) whom *the Naasseni* taking occasion,
have constructed their heresies.

And what are the tenets of the Peratae, and that their system is not
framed by them out of the holy Scriptures, but from astrological *art*.

What is the doctrine of the
Sethians,<sup>[2](footnote/fn9.htm#P920_240377.md)</sup> and that,
purloining<sup>[3](footnote/fn9.htm#P921_240476.md)</sup> their theories
from the wise men among the Greeks, they have patched together their own
system out of shreds of opinion taken from Musaeus, and Linus, and
Orpheus.

What are the tenets of Justinus, and that his system is framed by him,
not out of the holy Scriptures, but from the detail of marvels furnished
by Herodotus the historian.

I think that in the four preceding books I have very elaborately
explained the opinions propounded by all the speculators among both
Greeks and Barbarians, respecting the Divine Nature and the creation of
the world; and not even have I
omitted<sup>[4](footnote/fn9.htm#P926_241241.md)</sup> the consideration of
their systems of magic. So that I have for my readers undergone no
ordinary amount of toil, in my anxiety to urge many forward into a
desire of learning, and into stedfastness of knowledge in regard of the
truth. It remains, therefore, to hasten on to the refutation of the
heresies; but it is for the purpose of furnishing this (refutation) that
we have put forward the statements already made by us. For from
philosophers the heresiarchs
deriving<sup>[5](footnote/fn9.htm#P927_241963.md)</sup> starting-points,
(and) like cobblers patching together, according to their own particular
interpretation, the blunders of the ancients, have advanced them as
novelties to those that are capable of being deceived, as we shall prove
in the following books. In the remainder (of our work), the opportunity
invites us to approach the treatment of our proposed subjects, and to
begin from those who have presumed to celebrate a
serpent,<sup>[6](footnote/fn9.htm#P928_242551.md)</sup> the originator of
the error (in question), through certain expressions devised by the
energy of his own (ingenuity). The priests, then, and champions of the
system, have been first those who have been called
Naasseni,<sup>[7](footnote/fn9.htm#P929_242928.md)</sup> being so
denominated from the Hebrew language, for the serpent is called
naas<sup>[8](footnote/fn9.htm#P930_243538)</sup> (in Hebrew.md).
Subsequently, however, they have styled themselves Gnostics, alleging
that they alone have sounded the depths of knowledge. Now, from the
system of these (speculators), many, detaching parts, have constructed a
heresy which, though with several subdivisions, is essentially one, and
they explain precisely the same (tenets); though conveyed under the
guise of different opinions, as the following discussion, according as
it progresses, will prove.

These (Naasseni), then, according to the
system<sup>[9](footnote/fn9.htm#P932_244086.md)</sup> advanced by them,
magnify, (as the originating cause) of all things else, a man and a son
of man. And this man is a hermaphrodite, and is denominated among them
Adam; and hymns many and various are made to him. The
hymns<sup>[10](footnote/fn9.htm#P933_244608.md)</sup> however-to be
brief-are couched among them in some such form as this: "From thee
(comes) father, and through thee (comes) mother, two names immortal,
progenitors of Aeons, O denizen of heaven, thou illustrious man." But
they divide him as Geryon<sup>[11](footnote/fn9.htm#P934_244886.md)</sup>
into three parts. For, say they, of this man one part is rational,
another psychical, another earthly. And they suppose that the knowledge
of him is the originating principle of the capacity for a knowledge of
God, expressing themselves thus: "The originating principle of
perfection is the knowledge<sup>[12](footnote/fn9.htm#P935_245312.md)</sup>
of man, while the knowledge of God is absolute perfection." All these
qualities, however-rational, and psychical, and earthly-have, (the
Naassene) says, retired and descended into one man
simultaneously-Jesus,<sup>[13](footnote/fn9.htm#P936_246022.md)</sup> who
was born of Mary. And these three men (the Naassene) says, are in the
habit of speaking (through Jesus) at the same time together, each from
their own proper substances to those peculiarly their own. For,
according to these, there are three kinds of all existent
things-angelic, psychical, earthly; and there are three
churches-angelic, psychical, earthly; and the names of these are elect,
called, captive.

These are the heads of very numerous discourses which (the Naassene)
asserts James the brother of the Lord handed down to
Mariamne.<sup>[14](footnote/fn9.htm#P940_247232.md)</sup> In order, then,
that these impious (heretics) may no longer belie Mariamne or James, or
the Saviour Himself, let us come to the mystic rites (whence these have
derived their figment),-to a consideration, if it seems right, of both
the Barbarian and Grecian (mysteries),-and let us see how these
(heretics), collecting together the secret and ineffable mysteries of
all the Gentiles, are uttering falsehoods against Christ, and are making
dupes of those who are not acquainted with these orgies of the Gentiles.
For since the foundation of the doctrine with them is the man Adam, and
they say that concerning him it has been written, "Who shall declare his
generation? "<sup>[15](footnote/fn9.htm#P941_248360.md)</sup> learn how,
partly deriving from the Gentiles the undiscoverable and
diversified<sup>[16](footnote/fn9.htm#P942_248459.md)</sup> generation of
the man, they fictitiously apply it to Christ.

"Now earth,"<sup>[17](footnote/fn9.htm#P944_248562.md)</sup> say the
Greeks, "gave forth a man, (earth) first bearing a goodly gift, wishing
to become mother not of plants devoid of sense, nor beasts without
reason, but of a gentle and highly favoured creature." "It, however, is
difficult," (the Naassene) says, "to ascertain whether
Alalcomeneus,<sup>[18](footnote/fn9.htm#P945_249181.md)</sup> first of men,
rose upon the Boeotians over Lake Cephisus; or whether it were the
Idaean Curetes, a divine race; or the Phrygian Corybantes, whom first
the sun beheld springing up after the manner of the growth of trees; or
whether Arcadia brought forth Pelasgus, of greater antiquity than the
moon; or Eleusis (produced) Diaulus, an inhabitant of Raria; or Lemnus
begot Cabirus, fair child of secret orgies; or Pallene (brought forth)
the Phlegraean Alcyoneus, oldest of the giants. But the Libyans affirm
that Iarbas, first born, on emerging from arid plains, commenced eating
the sweet acorn of Jupiter. But the Nile of the Egyptians," he says, "up
to this day fertilizing mud, (and therefore) generating animals, renders
up living bodies, which acquire flesh from moist vapour." The Assyrians,
however, say that fish-eating
Oannes<sup>[19](footnote/fn9.htm#P946_250080.md)</sup> was (the first man,
and) produced among themselves. The Chaldeans, however, say that this
Adam is the man whom alone earth brought forth. And that he lay
inanimate, unmoved, (and) still as a statue; being an image of him who
is above, who is celebrated as the man
Adam,<sup>[20](footnote/fn9.htm#P947_250586.md)</sup> having been begotten
by many powers, concerning whom individually is an enlarged discussion.

In order, therefore, that finally the Great Man from above may be
overpowered, "from whom," as they say, "the whole family named on earth
and in the heavens has been formed, to him was given also a soul, that
through the soul he might suffer; and that the enslaved image may be
punished of the Great and most Glorious and Perfect Man, for even so
they call him. Again, then, they ask what is the soul, and whence, and
what kind in its nature, that, coming to the man and moving
him,<sup>[21](footnote/fn9.htm#P949_251861.md)</sup> it should enslave and
punish the image of the Perfect Man. They do not, however, (on this
point) institute an inquiry from the Scriptures, but ask this (question)
also from the mystic (rites). And they affirm that the soul is very
difficult to discover, and hard to understand; for it does not remain in
the same figure or the same form invariably, or in one passive
condition, that either one could express it by a sign, or comprehend it
substantially.

But they have these varied changes (of the soul) set down in the gospel
inscribed "according to the
Egyptians."<sup>[22](footnote/fn9.htm#P951_252463.md)</sup> They are, then,
in doubt, as all the rest of men among the Gentiles, whether (the soul)
is at all from something pre-existent, or whether from the self-produced
(one),<sup>[23](footnote/fn9.htm#P952_252834.md)</sup> or from a widespread
Chaos. And first they fly for refuge to the mysteries of the Assyrians,
perceiving the threefold division of the man; for the Assyrians first
advanced the opinion that the soul has three parts, and yet (is
essentially) one. For of soul, say they, is every nature desirous, and
each in a different manner. For soul is cause of all things made; all
things that are nourished, (the Naassene) says, and that grow, require
soul. For it is not possible, he says, to obtain any nourishment or
growth where soul is not present. For even stones, he affirms, are
animated, for they possess what is capable of increase; but increase
would not at any time take place without nourishment, for it is by
accession that things which are being increased grow, but accession is
the nourishment of things that are nurtured. Every nature, then, as of
thins celestial and (the Naasene) says, of things celestial, and
earthly, and infernal, desires a soul. And an entity of this description
the Assyrians call Adonis or
Endymion;<sup>[24](footnote/fn9.htm#P953_253968.md)</sup> and when it is
styled Adonis, Venus, he says, loves and desires the soul when styled by
such a name. But Venus is production, according to them. But whenever
Proserpine or Cora becomes enamoured with Adonis, there results, he
says, a certain mortal soul separated from Venus (that is, from
generation). But should the Moon pass into concupiscence for Endymion,
and into love of her form, the
nature,<sup>[25](footnote/fn9.htm#P954_254540.md)</sup> he says, of the
higher beings requires a soul likewise. But if, he says, the mother of
the gods emasculate Attis,<sup>[26](footnote/fn9.htm#P955_254675.md)</sup>
and herself has this (person) as an object of affection, the blessed
nature, he says, of the supernal and everlasting (beings) alone recalls
the male power of the soul to itself.

For (the Naassene) says, there is the hermaphrodite man. According to
this account of theirs, the intercourse of woman with man is
demonstrated, in conformity with such teaching, to be an exceedingly
wicked and filthy
(practice).<sup>[27](footnote/fn9.htm#P957_255221.md)</sup> For, says (the
Naassene), Attis has been emasculated, that is, he has passed over from
the earthly parts of the nether world to the everlasting substance
above, where, he says, there is neither female or
male,<sup>[28](footnote/fn9.htm#P958_255453.md)</sup> but a new
creature,<sup>[29](footnote/fn9.htm#P959_255648.md)</sup> a new man, which
is hermaphrodite. As to where, however, they use the expression "above,"
I shall show when I come to the proper place (for treating this
subject). But they assert that, by their account, they testify that Rhea
is not absolutely isolated, but-for so I may say-the universal creature;
and this they declare to be what is affirmed by the Word. "For the
invisible things of Him are seen from the creation of the world, being
understood by the things that are made by Him, even His eternal power
and Godhead, for the purpose of leaving them without excuse. Wherefore,
knowing God, they glorified Him not as God, nor gave Him thanks; but
their foolish heart was rendered vain. For, professing themselves to be
wise, they became fools, and changed the glory of the uncorruptible God
into images of the likeness of corruptible man, and of birds, and
four-footed beasts, and creeping things. Wherefore also God gave them up
unto vile affections; for even their women did change the natural use
into that which is against nature." What, however, the natural use is,
according to them, we shall afterwards declare. "And likewise also the
men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one
toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly"-now the
expression that which is unseemly signifies, according to these
(Naasseni), the first and blessed substance, figureless, the cause of
all figures to those things that are moulded into shapes,-"and receiving
in themselves that recompense of their error which was
meet."<sup>[30](footnote/fn9.htm#P960_257234.md)</sup> For in these words
which Paul has spoken they say the entire secret of theirs, and a hidden
mystery of blessed pleasure, are comprised. For the promise of washing
is not any other, according to them, than the introduction of him that
is washed in, according to them, life-giving water, and anointed with
ineffable<sup>[31](footnote/fn9.htm#P961_257568.md)</sup> ointment (than
his introduction) into unfading bliss.

But they assert that not only is there in favour of their doctrine,
testimony to be drawn from the mysteries of the Assyrians, but also from
those of the Phrygians concerning the happy nature-concealed, and yet at
the same time disclosed-of things that have been, and are coming into
existence, and moreover will be,-(a happy nature) which, (the Naassene)
says, is the kingdom of heaven to be sought for within a
man.<sup>[32](footnote/fn9.htm#P963_258067.md)</sup> And concerning this
(nature) they hand down an explicit passage,
occurring<sup>[33](footnote/fn9.htm#P964_258162.md)</sup> in the Gospel
inscribed according to
Thomas,<sup>[34](footnote/fn9.htm#P965_258330.md)</sup> expressing
themselves thus: "He who seeks me, will find me in children from seven
years old; for there concealed, I shall in the fourteenth age be made
manifest." This, however, is not (the teaching) of Christ, but of
Hippocrates, who uses these words: "A child of seven years is half of a
father." And so it is that these (heretics), placing the originative
nature of the universe in causative seed, (and) having ascertained the
(aphorism) of Hippocrates,<sup>[35](footnote/fn9.htm#P966_259289.md)</sup>
that a child of seven years old is half of a father, say that in
fourteen years, according to Thomas, he is manifested. This, with them,
is the ineffable and mystical Logos. They assert, then, that the
Egyptians, who after the
Phrygians,<sup>[36](footnote/fn9.htm#P967_259606.md)</sup> it is
established, are of greater antiquity than all mankind, and who
confessedly were the first to proclaim to all the rest of men the rites
and orgies of, at the same time, all the gods, as well as the species
and energies (of things), have the sacred and august, and for those who
are not initiated, unspeakable mysteries of Isis. These, however, are
not anything else than what by her of the seven dresses and sable robe
was sought and snatched away, namely, the pudendum of Osiris. And they
say that Osiris is water.<sup>[37](footnote/fn9.htm#P968_260158.md)</sup>
But the seven-robed nature, encircled and arrayed with seven mantles of
ethereal texture-for so they call the planetary stars, allegorizing and
denominating them ethereal<sup>[38](footnote/fn9.htm#P969_260388.md)</sup>
robes,-is as it were the changeable generation, and is exhibited as the
creature transformed by the ineffable and
unportrayable,<sup>[39](footnote/fn9.htm#P970_260539.md)</sup> and
inconceivable and figureless one. And this, (the Naassene) says, is what
is declared in Scripture, "The just will fall seven times, and rise
again."<sup>[40](footnote/fn9.htm#P971_260716.md)</sup> For these falls, he
says, are the changes of the stars, moved by Him who puts all things in
motion.

They affirm, then, concerning the
substance<sup>[41](footnote/fn9.htm#P973_260894.md)</sup> of the seed which
is a cause of all existent things, that it is none of these, but that it
produces and forms all things that are made, expressing themselves thus:
"I become what I wish, and I am what I am: on account of this I say,
that what puts all things in motion is itself unmoved. For what exists
remains forming all things, and nought of existing things is
made."<sup>[42](footnote/fn9.htm#P974_261285.md)</sup> He says that this
(one) alone is good, and that what is spoken by the
Saviour<sup>[43](footnote/fn9.htm#P975_261402.md)</sup> is declared
concerning this (one): "Why do you say that am good? One is good, my
Father which is in the heavens, who causeth His sun to rise upon the
just and unjust, and sendeth rain upon saints and
sinners."<sup>[44](footnote/fn9.htm#P976_261660.md)</sup> But who the
saintly ones are on whom He sends the rain, and the sinners on whom the
same sends the rain, this likewise we shall afterwards declare with the
rest. And this is the great and secret and unknown mystery of the
universe, concealed and revealed among the Egyptians. For
Osiris,<sup>[45](footnote/fn9.htm#P977_261966)</sup> (the Naassene.md)
says, is in temples in front of
Isis;<sup>[46](footnote/fn9.htm#P978_262093.md)</sup> and his *pudendum*
stands exposed, looking downwards, and crowned with all its own fruits
of things that are made. And (he affirms) that such stands not only in
the most hallowed temples chief of idols, but that also, for the
information of all, it is as it were a light not set under a bushel, but
upon a candlestick, proclaiming its message upon the
housetops,<sup>[47](footnote/fn9.htm#P979_262488.md)</sup> in all byways,
and all streets, and near the actual dwellings, placed in front as a
certain appointed limit and termination of the dwelling, and that this
is denominated the good (entity) by all. For they style this
good-producing, not knowing what they say. And the Greeks, deriving this
mystical (expression) from the Egyptians, preserve it until this day.
For we behold, says (the Naassene), statues of Mercury, of such a figure
honoured among them.

Worshipping, however, Cyllenius with especial distinction, they style
him Logios. For Mercury is Logos, who being interpreter and fabricator
of the things that have been made simultaneously, and that are being
produced, and that will exist, stands honoured among them, fashioned
into some such figure as is the *pudendum* of a man, having an impulsive
power from the parts below towards those above. And that this
(deity)-that is, a Mercury of this description-is, (the Naassene) says,
a conjurer of the dead, and a guide of departed spirits, and an
originator of souls; nor does this escape the notice of the poets, who
express themselves thus:-

Not Penelope's suitors, says he, O wretches! but (souls) awakened and
brought to recollection of themselves,

That is, from the blessed man from above, or the primal man or Adam, as
it seems to them, *souls* have been conveyed down here into a creation
of clay, that they may serve the Demiurge of this creation,
Ialdabaoth,<sup>[50](footnote/fn9.htm#P988_264091.md)</sup> a fiery God, a
fourth number; for so they call the Demiurge and father of the formal
world:-

This, he says, is he who alone has power of life and death. Concerning
this, he says, it has been written, "Thou shalt rule them with a rod of
iron."<sup>[52](footnote/fn9.htm#P994_264555.md)</sup> The poet, however,
he says, being desirous of adorning the incomprehensible (potency) of
the blessed nature of the Logos, invested him with not an iron, but
golden wand. And he enchants the eyes of the dead, as he says, and
raises up again those that are slumbering, after having been roused from
sleep, and after having been suitors. And concerning these, he says, the
Scripture speaks: "Awake thou that sleepest, and arise, and Christ will
give thee light."<sup>[53](footnote/fn9.htm#P995_265031.md)</sup>

This is the Christ who, he says, in all that have been generated, is the
portrayed Son of Man from the unportrayable Logos. This, he says, is the
great and unspeakable mystery of the Eleusinian rites, Hye,
Cye.<sup>[54](footnote/fn9.htm#P997_265260.md)</sup> And he affirms that
all things have been subjected unto him, and this is that which has been
spoken, "Their sound is gone forth unto all the
earth,"<sup>[55](footnote/fn9.htm#P998_265459.md)</sup> just as it agrees
with the expressions,
"Mercury<sup>[56](footnote/fn9.htm#P999_265525.md)</sup> waving his wand,
*guides the souls*, but they twittering follow." I mean the disembodied
spirits follow continuously in such a way as the poet by his imagery
delineates, using these words:-

From ridge of rock, and each to other closely
clings."<sup>[57](footnote/fn10.md)</sup>

The expression "rock," he says, he uses of Adam. This, he affirms, is
Adam: "The chief corner-stone become the head of the
corner.<sup>[58](footnote/fn10.htm#P1005_266024.md)</sup> For that in the
head the substance is the formative brain from which the entire family
is fashioned.<sup>[59](footnote/fn10.htm#P1006_266163.md)</sup> "Whom," he
says, "I place as a rock at the foundations of Zion." Allegorizing, he
says, he speaks of the creation of the man. The rock is interposed
(within) the teeth, as
Homer<sup>[60](footnote/fn10.htm#P1007_266360.md)</sup> says, "enclosure of
teeth," that is, a wall anti fortress, in which exists the inner man,
who thither has fallen from Adam, the primal man above. And he has been
"severed without hands to effect the
division,"<sup>[61](footnote/fn10.htm#P1008_266680.md)</sup> and has been
borne down into the image of oblivion, *being earthly and clayish*. And
he asserts that the twittering spirits follow him, that is, the Logos:-

That is, he guides them;

That is, he says, into the eternal places separated from all wickedness.
For whither, he says, did they come:-

This, he says, is ocean, "generation of gods and generation of
men"<sup>[63](footnote/fn10.htm#P1017_267285.md)</sup> ever whirled round
by the eddies of water, at one time upwards, at another time downwards.
But he says there ensues a generation of men when the ocean flows
downwards; but when upwards to the wall and fortress and the cliff of
Luecas, a generation of gods takes place. This, he asserts, is that
which has been written: "I said, Ye are gods, and all children of the
highest; "<sup>[64](footnote/fn10.htm#P1018_267693.md)</sup> "If ye hasten
to fly out of Egypt, and repair beyond the Red Sea into the wilderness,"
that is, from earthly intercourse to the Jerusalem above, which is the
mother of the living;<sup>[65](footnote/fn10.htm#P1019_267920.md)</sup>
"If, moreover, again you return into Egypt," that is, into earthly
intercourse,<sup>[66](footnote/fn10.htm#P1020_268018.md)</sup> "ye shall
die as men." For mortal, he says, is every generation below, but
immortal that which is begotten above, for it is born of water only, and
of spirit, being spiritual, not carnal. But what (is born) below is
carnal, that is, he says, what is written. "That which is born of the
flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the spirit is
spirit."<sup>[67](footnote/fn10.htm#P1021_268445.md)</sup> This, according
to them, is the spiritual generation. This, he says, is the great
Jordan<sup>[68](footnote/fn10.htm#P1022_268552.md)</sup> which, flowing on
(here) below, and preventing the children of Israel from departing out
of Egypt-I mean from terrestrial intercourse, for Egypt is with them the
body,-Jesus drove back, and made it flow upwards.

Adopting these and such like (opinions), these most marvellous Gnostics,
inventors of a novel<sup>[69](footnote/fn10.htm#P1026_269836.md)</sup>
grammatical art, magnify Homer as their prophet-as one, (according to
them,) who, after the mode adopted in the mysteries, announces these
truths; and they mock those who are not indoctrinated into the holy
Scriptures, by betraying them into such notions. They make, however, the
following assertion: he who says that all things derive consistence from
one, is in error; but he who says that they are of three, is in
possession of the truth, and will furnish a solution of the (phonomena
of the) universe. For there is, says (the Naassene), one blessed nature
of the Blessed Man, of him who is above, (namely) Adam; and there is one
mortal nature, that which is below; and there is one kingless
generation, which is begotten above, where, he says, is
Mariam<sup>[70](footnote/fn10.htm#P1027_270612.md)</sup> the sought-for
one, and Iothor the mighty sage, and Sephora the gazing one, and Moses
whose generation is not in Egypt, for children were born unto him in
Madian; and not even this, he says, has escaped the notice of the poets.

For, says he, it is necessary that the magnitudes be declared, and that
they thus be declared by all everywhere, "in order that hearing they may
not hear, and seeing they may not
see."<sup>[72](footnote/fn10.htm#P1032_271288.md)</sup> For if, he says,
the magnitudes were not declared, the world could not have obtained
consistence. These are the three tumid expressions (of these heretics),
Caulacau,<sup>[73](footnote/fn10.htm#P1033_271476.md)</sup> Saulasu,
Saulasu. Saulasu, i.e., Adam, who is farthest above; Saulasau, that is,
the mortal one below; Zeesar, that is, Jordan that flows upwards. This,
he says, is the hermaphrodite man (present) in all. But those who are
ignorant of him, call him Geryon with the threefold body-Geryon, i.e.,
as if (in the sense of) flowing from earth-but (whom) the Greeks by
common consent (style) "celestial horn of the moon," because he mixed
and blended all things in all. "For all things," he says, "were made by
him, and not even one thing was made without him, and what was made in
him is life."<sup>[74](footnote/fn10.htm#P1034_272352.md)</sup> This, says
he, is the life, the ineffable generation of perfect men, which was not
known by preceding generations. But the passage, "nothing was made
without him," refers to the formal world, for it was created without his
instrumentality by the third and fourth (of the quaternion named above).
For says he, this is the cup "Condy, out of which the king, while he
quaffs, draws his omens."<sup>[75](footnote/fn10.htm#P1035_272762.md)</sup>
This, he says, has been discovered hid in the beauteous seeds of
Benjamin. And the Greeks likewise, he says, speak of this in the
following terms:-

This, says he, was alone sufficient for its being understood by men; (I
mean) the cup of Anacreon declaring, (albeit) mutely, an ineffable
mystery. For dumb, says he, is Anacreon's cup; and (yet) Anacreon
affirms that it speaks to himself, in language mute, as to what sort he
must become-that is spiritual, not carnal-if he shall listen in silence
to the concealed mystery. And this is the water in those fair nuptials
which Jesus changing made into wine. This, he says, is the mighty and
true beginning of
miracles<sup>[77](footnote/fn10.htm#P1042_273613.md)</sup> which Jesus
performed in Cana of Galilee, and (thus) manifested the kingdom of
heaven. This, says he, is the kingdom of heaven that reposes within us
as a treasure, as leaven hid in the three measures of
meal.<sup>[78](footnote/fn10.htm#P1043_273842.md)</sup>

This is, he says, the great and ineffable mystery of the Samothracians,
which it is allowable, he says, for us only who are initiated to know.
For the Samothracians expressly hand down, in the mysteries that are
celebrated among them, that (same) Adam as the primal man. And
habitually there stand in the temple of the Samothracians two images of
naked men, having both hands stretched aloft towards heaven, and their
*pudenda erecta, as with* the statue of Mercury on Mount Cyllene. And
the aforesaid images are figures of the primal man, and of that
spiritual one that is born again, in every respect of the same substance
with that man. This, he says, is what is spoken by the Saviour: "If ye
do not drink my blood, and eat my flesh, ye will not enter into the
kingdom of heaven; but even though," He says, "ye drink of the cup which
I drink of, whither I go, ye cannot enter
there."<sup>[79](footnote/fn10.htm#P1045_274768.md)</sup> For He says He
was aware of what sort of nature each of His disciples was, and that
there was a necessity that each of them should attain unto His own
peculiar nature. For He says He chose twelve disciples from the twelve
tribes, and spoke by them to each tribe. On this account, He says, the
preachings of the twelve disciples neither did all hear, nor, if they
heard, could they receive. For the things that are not according to
nature, are with them contrary to nature.

This, he says, the Thracians who dwell around Haemus, and the Phrygians
similarly with the Thracians, denominate Corybas, because, (though)
deriving the beginning of his descent from the head above and from the
unportrayed brain, and (though) permeating all the principles of the
existing state of things, (yet) we do not perceive how and in what
manner he comes down. This, says he, is what is spoken: "We have heard
his voice, no doubt, but we have not seen his
shape."<sup>[80](footnote/fn10.htm#P1047_275743.md)</sup> For the voice of
him that is set apart<sup>[81](footnote/fn10.htm#P1048_275799.md)</sup> and
portrayed is heard; but (his) shape, which descends from above from the
unportrayed one,-what sort it is, nobody knows. It resides, however, in
an earthly mould, yet no one recognises it. This, he says, is "the god
that inhabiteth the flood," according to the Psalter, "and who speaketh
and crieth from many
waters."<sup>[82](footnote/fn10.htm#P1049_276181.md)</sup> The "many
waters," he says, are the diversified generation of mortal men, from
which (generation) he cries and vociferates to the unportrayed man,
saying, "Preserve my only-begotten from the
lions."<sup>[83](footnote/fn10.htm#P1050_276418.md)</sup> In reply to him,
it has, says he, been declared, "Israel, thou art my child: fear not;
even though thou passest through rivers, they shall not drown thee; even
though thou passest through fire, it shall not scorch
thee."<sup>[84](footnote/fn10.htm#P1051_276675.md)</sup> By rivers he
means, says he, the moist substance of generation, and by fire the
impulsive principle and desire for generation. "Thou art mine; fear
not." And again, he says, "If a mother forget her children, so as not to
have pity on them and give them food, I also will forget
you."<sup>[85](footnote/fn10.htm#P1052_276980.md)</sup> Adam, he says,
speaks to his own men: "But even though a woman forget these things, yet
I will not forget you. I have painted you on my hands." In regard,
however, of his ascension, that is his regeneration, that he may become
spiritual, not carnal, the Scripture, he says, speaks (thus): "Open the
gates, ye who are your rulers; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors,
and the King of glory shall come in," that is a wonder of
wonders.<sup>[86](footnote/fn10.htm#P1053_277438.md)</sup> "For who," he
says, "is this King of glory? A worm, and not a man; a reproach of man,
and an outcast of the people; himself is the King of glory, and powerful
in war."

And by war he means the war that is in the body, because its frame has
been made out of hostile elements; as it has been written, he says,
"Remember the conflict that exists in the body." Jacob, he says, saw
this entrance and this gate in his journey into Mesopotamia, that is,
when from a child he was now becoming a youth and a man; that is, (the
entrance and gate) were made known unto him as he journeyed into
Mesopotamia. But Mesopotamia, he says, is the current of the great ocean
flowing from the midst of the Perfect Man; and he was astonished at the
celestial gate, exclaiming, "How terrible is this place! it is nought
else than the house of God, and this (is) the gate of
heaven."<sup>[87](footnote/fn10.htm#P1055_278451.md)</sup> On account of
this, he says, Jesus uses the words, "I am the true
gate."<sup>[88](footnote/fn10.htm#P1056_278548.md)</sup> Now he who makes
these statements is, he says, the Perfect Man that is imaged from the
unportrayable one from above. The Perfect Man therefore cannot, he says,
be saved, unless, entering in through this gate, he be born again. But
this very one the Phrygians, he says, call also Papa, because he
tranquillized all things which, prior to his manifestation, were
confusedly and dissonantly moved. For the name, he says, of Papa belongs
simultaneously to all
creatures<sup>[89](footnote/fn10.htm#P1057_279046.md)</sup> -celestial, and
terrestrial, and infernal-who exclaim, *Cause to cease, cause to cease
the discord of the world*, and make "peace for those that are afar off,"
that is, for material and earthly beings; and "peace for those that are
near,"<sup>[90](footnote/fn10.htm#P1058_279383.md)</sup> that is, for
perfect men that are spiritual and endued with reason. But the Phrygians
denominate this same also "corpse"-buried in the body, as it were, in a
mausoleum and tomb. This, he says, is what has been declared, "Ye are
whited sepulchres, full," he says, "of dead men's bones
within,"<sup>[91](footnote/fn10.htm#P1059_279694.md)</sup> because there is
not in you the living man. And again he exclaims, "The dead shall start
forth from the graves,"<sup>[92](footnote/fn10.htm#P1060_279829.md)</sup>
that is, from the earthly bodies, being born again spiritual, not
carnal. For this, he says, is the Resurrection that takes place through
the gate of heaven, through which, he says, all those that do not enter
remain dead. These same Phrygians, however, he says, affirm again that
this very (man), as a consequence of the change, (becomes) a god. For,
he says, he becomes a god when, having risen from the dead, he will
enter into heaven through a gate of this kind. Paul the apostle, he
says, knew of this gate, partially opening it in a mystery, and stating
"that he was caught up by an angel, and ascended as far as the second
and third heaven into paradise itself; and that he beheld sights and
heard unspeakable words which it would not be possible for man to
declare."<sup>[93](footnote/fn10.htm#P1061_280630.md)</sup>

These are, he says, what are by all called the secret mysteries, "which
(also we speak), not in words taught of human wisdom, but in those
taught of the Spirit, comparing spiritual things with spiritual. But the
natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are
foolishness unto him."<sup>[94](footnote/fn10.htm#P1063_280958.md)</sup>
And these are, he says, the ineffable mysteries of the Spirit, which we
alone are acquainted with. Concerning these, he says, the Saviour has
declared, "No one can come unto me, except my heavenly Father draw some
one unto me."<sup>[95](footnote/fn10.htm#P1064_281210.md)</sup> For it is
very difficult, he says, to accept and receive this great and ineffable
mystery. And again, it is said, the Saviour has declared, "Not every one
that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven,
but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in
heaven."<sup>[96](footnote/fn10.htm#P1065_281517.md)</sup> And it is
necessary that they who perform this (will), not hear it merely, should
enter into the kingdom of heaven. And again, he says, the Saviour has
declared, "The publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of heaven
before you."<sup>[97](footnote/fn10.htm#P1066_281773.md)</sup> For "the
publicans," he says, are those who receive the
revenues<sup>[98](footnote/fn10.htm#P1067_281858.md)</sup> of all
things;<sup>[99](footnote/fn10.htm#P1068_281938.md)</sup> but we, he says,
are the publicans, "unto whom the ends of the ages have
come."<sup>[100](footnote/fn10.htm#P1069_282055.md)</sup> For "the ends,"
he says, are the seeds scattered from the unportrayable one upon the
world, through which the whole cosmical system is completed; for through
these also it began to exist. And this, he says, is what has been
declared: "The sower went forth to sow. And some fell by the wayside,
and was trodden down; and some on the rocky places, and sprang up," he
says, "and on account of its having no depth (of soil), it withered and
died; and some," he says, "fell on fair and good ground, and brought
forth fruit, some a hundred, some sixty, and some thirty fold. Who hath
ears," he says, "to hear, let him
hear."<sup>[101](footnote/fn10.htm#P1070_282695.md)</sup> The meaning of
this, he says, is as follows, that none becomes a hearer of these
mysteries, unless only the perfect Gnostics. This, he says, is the fair
and good land which Moses speaks of: "I will bring you into a fair and
good land, into a land flowing with milk and
honey."<sup>[102](footnote/fn10.htm#P1071_283026.md)</sup> This, he says,
is the honey and the milk, by tasting which those that are perfect
become kingless, and share in the Pleroma. This, he says, is the
Pleroma, through which all existent things that are
produced<sup>[103](footnote/fn10.htm#P1072_283257.md)</sup> have from the
ingenerable one been both produced and completed.

And this same (one) is styled also
by<sup>[104](footnote/fn10.htm#P1074_283379.md)</sup> the Phrygians
"unfruitful." For he is unfruitful when he is carnal, and causes the
desire of the flesh. This, he says, is what is spoken: "Every tree not
producing good fruit, is cut down and cast into the
fire."<sup>[105](footnote/fn10.htm#P1075_283624.md)</sup> For these fruits,
he says, are only rational living men, who enter in through the third
gate. They say, forsooth, "Ye devour the dead, and make the living;
(but) if ye eat the living, what will ye do? "They assert, however, that
the living "are rational faculties and minds, and men-pearls of that
unportrayable one cast before the creature
below."<sup>[106](footnote/fn10.htm#P1076_284009.md)</sup> This, he says,
is what (Jesus) asserts: "Throw not that which is holy unto the dogs,
nor pearls unto the
swine."<sup>[107](footnote/fn10.htm#P1077_284153.md)</sup> Now they allege
that the work of swine and dogs is the intercourse of the woman with a
man. And the Phrygians, he says, call this very one "goat-herd"
(Aipolis), not because, he says, he is accustomed to feed the goats
female and male, as the natural (men) use the name, but because, he
says, he is "Aipolis"-that is, always ranging over,-who both revolves
and carries around the entire cosmical system by his revolutionary
motion. For the word "Polein" signifies to turn and change things;
whence, he says, they all call the twos centre of the heaven poles
(Poloi). And the poet says:-

Undying Egyptian Proteus?
"<sup>[108](footnote/fn10.htm#P1080_284829.md)</sup>

He is not undone,<sup>[109](footnote/fn10.htm#P1082_284872.md)</sup> he
says,<sup>[110](footnote/fn10.htm#P1083_284943.md)</sup> but revolves as it
were, and goes round himself. Moreover, also, cities in which we dwell,
because we turn and go round in them, are denominated "Poleis." In this
manner, he says, the Phrygians call this one "Aipolis," inasmuch as he
everywhere ceaselessly turns all things, and changes them into their own
peculiar (functions). And the Phrygians style him, he says, "very
fruitful" likewise, "because," says he, "more numerous are the children
of the desolate one, than those of her which hath an husband;
"<sup>[111](footnote/fn10.htm#P1084_285505.md)</sup> that is, things by
being born again become immortal and abide for ever in great numbers,
even though the things that are produced may be few; whereas things
carnal, he says, are all corruptible, even though very many things (of
this type) are produced. For this reason, he says, "Rachel
wept<sup>[112](footnote/fn10.htm#P1085_285830.md)</sup> for her children,
and would not," says (the prophet), "be comforted; sorrowing for them,
for she knew," says he, "that they are
not."<sup>[113](footnote/fn10.htm#P1086_286089.md)</sup> But Jeremiah
likewise utters lamentation for Jerusalem below, not the city in
Phoenicia, but the corruptible generation below. For Jeremiah likewise,
he says, was aware of the Perfect Man, of him that is born again-of
water and the Spirit not carnal. At least Jeremiah himself remarked: "He
is a man, and who shall know him?
"<sup>[114](footnote/fn10.htm#P1087_286452.md)</sup> In this manner, (the
Naassene) says, the knowledge of the Perfect Man is exceedingly
profound, and difficult of comprehension. For, he says, the beginning of
perfection is a knowledge of man, whereas knowledge of God is absolute
perfection.

The Phrygians, however, assert, he says, that he is likewise "a green
ear of corn reaped." And after the Phrygians, the Athenians, while
initiating people into the Eleusinian rites, likewise display to those
who are being admitted to the highest grade at these mysteries, the
mighty, and marvellous, and most perfect secret suitable for one
initiated into the highest mystic truths: (I allude to) an ear of corn
in silence reaped. But this ear of corn is also (considered) among the
Athenians to constitute the perfect enormous illumination (that has
descended) from the unportrayable one, just as the Hierophant himself
(declares); not, indeed, emasculated like
Attis,<sup>[115](footnote/fn10.htm#P1089_287383.md)</sup> but made a eunuch
by means of hemlock, and
despising<sup>[116](footnote/fn10.htm#P1090_287557.md)</sup> all carnal
generation. (Now) by night in Eleusis, beneath a huge fire, (the
Celebrant) enacting the great and secret mysteries, vociferates and
cries aloud, saying, "August Brimo has brought forth a consecrated son,
Brimus; "that is, a potent (mother has been delivered of) a potent
child. But revered, he says, is the generation that is spiritual,
heavenly, from above, and potent is he that is so born. For the mystery
is called "Eleusin" and "Anactorium." "Eleusin," because, he says, we
who are spiritual come flowing down from Adam above; for the word
"eleusesthai" is, he says, of the same import with the expression "to
come." But "Anactorium" is of the same import with the expression "to
ascend upwards." This, he says, is what they affirm who have been
initiated in the mysteries of the Eleusinians. It is, however, a
regulation of law, that those who have been admitted into the lesser
should again be initiated into the Great Mysteries. For greater
destinies obtain greater portions. But the inferior mysteries, he says,
are those of Proserpine below; in regard of which mysteries, and the
path which leads thither, which is wide and spacious, and conducts those
that are perishing to Proserpine, the poet likewise says:-

Highly-honoured Aphrodite's lovely
grove."<sup>[117](footnote/fn10.htm#P1094_288963.md)</sup>

These, he says, are the inferior mysteries, those appertaining to carnal
generation. Now, those men who are initiated into these inferior
(mysteries) ought to pause, and (then) be admitted into the great (and)
heavenly (ones). For they, he says, who obtain their shares (in this
mystery), receive greater portions. For this, he says, is the gate of
heaven; and this a house of God, where the Good Deity dwells alone. And
into this (gate), he says, no unclean person shall enter, nor one that
is natural or carnal; but it is reserved for the spiritual only. And
those who come hither ought to cast
off<sup>[118](footnote/fn10.htm#P1096_289619.md)</sup> their garments, and
become all of them bridegrooms, emasculated through the virginal spirit.
For this is the virgin<sup>[119](footnote/fn10.htm#P1097_289757.md)</sup>
who carries in her womb and conceives and brings forth a son, not
animal, not corporeal, but blessed for evermore. Concerning these, it is
said, the Saviour has expressly declared that "straight and narrow is
the way that leadeth unto life, and few there are that enter upon it;
whereas broad and spacious is the way that leadeth unto destruction, and
many there are that pass through
it."<sup>[120](footnote/fn10.htm#P1098_290169.md)</sup>

The Phrygians, however, further assert that the father of the universe
is "Amygdalus," not a tree, he says, but that he is "Amygdalus" who
previously existed; and he having in himself the perfect fruit, as it
were, throbbing and moving in the depth, rent his breasts, and produced
his now invisible, and nameless, and ineffable child. respecting whom we
shall speak. For the word "Amyxai" signifies, as it were, to burst and
sever through, as he says (happens) in the case of inflamed bodies, and
which have in themselves any tumour; and when doctors have cut this,
they call it "Amychai." In this way, he says, the Phrygians call him
"Amygdalus," from which proceeded and was born the Invisible (One), "by
whom all things were made, and nothing was made without
Him."<sup>[121](footnote/fn11.md)</sup> And the Phrygians say that what has
been thence produced is "Syrictas" (piper), because the Spirit that is
born is harmonious. "For God," he says, "is Spirit; wherefore," he
affirms, "neither in this mountain do the true worshippers worship, nor
in Jerusalem, but in spirit. For the adoration of the perfect ones," he
says, "is spiritual, not
carnal."<sup>[122](footnote/fn11.htm#P1103_291644.md)</sup> The Spirit,
however, he says, is there where likewise the Father is named, and the
Son is there born from this Father. This, he says, is the many-named,
thousand-eyed Incomprehensible One, of whom every nature-each, however,
differently-is desirous. This, he says, is the word of God, which, he
says, is a word of revelation of the Great Power. Wherefore it will be
sealed, and hid, and concealed, lying in the habitation where lies the
basis of the root of the universe, viz. Aeons, Powers, Intelligences,
Gods, Angels, delegated Spirits, Entities, Nonentities, Generables,
Ingenerables, Incomprehensibles, Comprehensibles, Years, Months, Days,
Hours, (and) Invisible Point from
which<sup>[123](footnote/fn11.htm#P1104_292350.md)</sup> what is least
begins to increase gradually. That which is, he says, nothing, and which
consists of nothing, inasmuch as it is indivisible-(I mean) a point-will
become through its own reflective power a certain incomprehensible
magnitude. This, he says, is the kingdom of heaven, the grain of mustard
seed,<sup>[124](footnote/fn11.htm#P1105_292690.md)</sup> the point which is
indivisible in the body; and, he says, no one knows this (point) save
the spiritual only. This, he says, is what has been spoken: "There is no
speech nor language where their voice is not
heard."<sup>[125](footnote/fn11.htm#P1106_292966.md)</sup>

They rashly assume in this manner, that whatsoever things have been said
and done by all men, (may be made to harmonize) with their own
particular mental view, alleging that all things become spiritual.
Whence likewise they assert, that those exhibiting themselves in
theatres,-not even these say or do anything without premeditation.
Therefore, he says, when, on the people assembling in the theatres, any
one enters clad in a remarkable robe, carrying a harp and playing a tune
(upon it, accompanying it) with a song of the great mysteries, he speaks
as follows, not knowing what he says: "Whether (thou art) the race of
Saturn or happy Jupiter,<sup>[126](footnote/fn11.htm#P1108_293633.md)</sup>
or mighty Rhea, Hail, Attis, gloomy mutilation of Rhea. Assyrians style
thee thrice-longed-for Adonis, and the whole of Egypt (calls thee)
Osiris, celestial horn of the moon; Greeks denominate (thee) Wisdom;
Samothracians, venerable Adam; Haemonians, Corybas; and them Phrygians
(name thee) at one time Papa, at another time Corpse, or God, or
Fruitless, or Aipolos, or green Ear of Corn that has been reaped, or
whom the very fertile Amygdalus produced-a man, a musician." This, he
says, is multiform Attis, whom while they celebrate in a hymn, they
utter these words: "I will hymn Attis, son of Rhea, not with the buzzing
sounds of trumpets, or of Idaean pipers, which accord with (the voices
of) the Curetes; but I will mingle (my song) with Apollo's music of
harps, evoe, evan, ' inasmuch as thou art Pan, as thou art Bacchus, as
thou art shepherd of brilliant stars."

On account of these and such like reasons, these constantly attend the
mysteries called those of the "Great Mother," supposing especially that
they behold by means of the ceremonies performed there the entire
mystery. For these have nothing more than the ceremonies that are
performed there, except that they are not emasculated: they merely
complete the work of the emasculated. For with the utmost severity and
vigilance they enjoin (on their votaries) to abstain, as if they were
emasculated, from intercourse with a woman. The rest, however, of the
proceeding (observed in these mysteries), as we have declared at some
length, (they follow) just as (if they were) emasculated persons. And
they do not worship any other object but Naas, (from thence) being
styled Naasseni. But Naas is the serpent from whom, i.e., from the word
Naas, (the Naassene) says, are all that under heaven are denominated
temples (Naos). And (he states) that to him alone-that is, Naas-is
dedicated every shrine and every initiatory rite, and every mystery;
and, in general, that a religious ceremony could not be discovered under
heaven, in which a temple (Naos) has no existence; and in the temple
itself is Naas, from whom it has received its denomination of temple
(Naos). And these affirm that the serpent is a moist substance, just as
Thales also, the Milesian, (spoke of water as an originating principle,)
and that nothing of existing things, immortal or mortal, animate or
inanimate, could consist at all without him. And that all things are
subject unto him, and that he is good, and that he has all things in
himself, as in the horn of the one-horned
bull;<sup>[127](footnote/fn11.htm#P1110_296275.md)</sup> so as that he
imparts beauty and bloom to all things that exist according to their own
nature and peculiarity, as if passing through all, just as ("the river)
proceeding forth from Edem, and dividing itself into four
heads."<sup>[128](footnote/fn11.htm#P1111_296526.md)</sup>

They assert, however, that Edem is the brain, as it were, bound and
tightly fastened in encircling robes, as if (in) heaven. But they
suppose that man, as far as the head only, is Paradise, therefore that
"this river, which proceeds out of Edem," that is, from the brain, "is
divided into four heads,<sup>[129](footnote/fn11.htm#P1113_296847.md)</sup>
and that the name of the first river is called Phison; this is that
which encompasseth all the land of Havilath: there is gold, and the gold
of that land is excellent, and there is bdellium and the onyx stone."
This, he says, is the eye, which, by its honour (among the rest of the
bodily organs), and its colours, furnishes testimony to what is spoken.
"But the name of the second river is Gihon: this is that which
compasseth the land of Ethiopia." This, he says, is hearing, since Gihon
is (a tortuous stream), resembling a sort of labyrinth. "And the name of
the third is Tigris. This is that which floweth over against (the
country of) the Assyrians." This, he
says,<sup>[130](footnote/fn11.htm#P1114_297542.md)</sup> is smelling,
employing the exceedingly rapid current of the stream (as an analogy of
this sense). But it flows over against (the country of) the Assyrians,
because in every act of respiration following upon expiration, the
breath drawn in from the external atmosphere enters with swifter motion
and greater force. For this, he says, is the nature of respiration. "But
the fourth river is Euphrates." This, they assert, is the mouth, through
which are the passage outwards of prayer, and the passage inwards of
nourishment. (The mouth) makes glad, and nurtures and fashions the
Spiritual Perfect Man. This, he says, is "the water that is above the
firmament,"<sup>[131](footnote/fn11.htm#P1115_298224.md)</sup> concerning
which, he says, the Saviour has declared, "If thou knewest who it is
that asks, thou wouldst have asked from Him, and He would have given you
to drink living, bubbling
water."<sup>[132](footnote/fn11.htm#P1116_298430.md)</sup> Into this water,
he says, every nature enters, choosing its own substances; and its
peculiar quality comes to each nature from this water, he says, more
than iron does to the magnet, and the gold to the
backbone<sup>[133](footnote/fn11.htm#P1117_298662.md)</sup> of the sea
falcon, and the chaff to the amber.

But if any one, he says, is blind from birth, and has never beheld the
true light, "which lighteneth every man that cometh into the
world,"<sup>[134](footnote/fn11.htm#P1119_299331.md)</sup> by us let him
recover his sight, and behold, as it were, through some paradise planted
with every description of tree, and supplied with abundance of fruits,
water coursing its way through all the trees and fruits; and he will see
that from one and the same water the olive chooses for itself and draws
the oil, and the vine the wine; and (so is it with) the rest of plants,
according to each *genus*. That Man, however, he says, is of no
reputation in the world, but of illustrious fame in heaven, being
betrayed by those who are ignorant (of his perfections) to those who
know him not, being accounted as a drop from a
cask.<sup>[135](footnote/fn11.htm#P1120_299986.md)</sup> We, however, he
says, are spiritual, who, from the life-giving water of Euphrates, which
flows through the midst of Babylon, choose our own peculiar quality as
we pass through the true gate, which is the blessed Jesus. And of all
men, we Christians alone are those who in the third gate celebrate the
mystery, and are anointed there with the unspeakable chrism from a horn,
as David (was anointed), not from an earthen
vessel,<sup>[136](footnote/fn11.htm#P1121_300434.md)</sup> he says, as
(was) Saul, who held converse with the evil
demon<sup>[137](footnote/fn11.htm#P1122_300533.md)</sup> of carnal
concupiscence.

The foregoing remarks, then, though few out of many, we have thought
proper to bring forward. For innumerable are the silly and crazy
attempts of folly. But since, to the best of our ability, we have
explained the unknown Gnosis, it seemed expedient likewise to adduce the
following point. This psalm of theirs has been composed, by which they
seem to celebrate all the mysteries of the error (advanced by) them in a
hymn, couched in the following terms:-

Styled "Gnosis," I'll impart.

These doctrines, then, the Naasseni attempt to establish, calling
themselves Gnostics. But since the error is many-headed and diversified,
resembling, in truth, the hydra that we read of in history; when, at one
blow, we have struck off the heads of this (delusion) by means of
refutation, employing the wand of truth, we shall entirely exterminate
the monster. For neither do the remaining heresies present much
difference of aspect from this, having a mutual connection through (the
same) spirit of error. But since, altering the words and the names of
the serpent, they wish that there should be many heads of the serpent,
neither thus shall we fail thoroughly to refute them as they desire.

There is also unquestionably a certain other (head of the
hydra,<sup>[140](footnote/fn11.htm#P1158_303156.md)</sup> namely, the
heresy) of the Peratae,<sup>[141](footnote/fn11.htm#P1159_303415.md)</sup>
whose blasphemy against Christ has for many years escaped notice. And
the present is a fitting opportunity for bringing to light the secret
mysteries of such (heretics). These allege that the world is one, triply
divided. And of the triple division with them, one portion is a certain
single originating principle, just as it were a huge fountain, which can
be divided mentally into infinite segments. Now the first segment, and
that which, according to them, is (a segment) in preference (to
others),<sup>[142](footnote/fn11.htm#P1160_304394.md)</sup> is a triad, and
it is called a Perfect Good, (and) a Paternal Magnitude. And the second
portion of the triad of these is, as it were, a certain infinite crowd
of potentialities that are
generated<sup>[143](footnote/fn11.htm#P1161_304796.md)</sup> from
themselves, (while) the third is
formal.<sup>[144](footnote/fn11.htm#P1162_304995.md)</sup> And the first,
which is good, is unbegotten, and the second is a self-producing good,
and the third is created; and hence it is that they expressly declare
that there are three Gods, three Logoi, three Minds, three Men. For to
each portion of the world, after the division has been made, they assign
both Gods, and Logoi, and Minds, and Men, and the rest; but that from
unorigination and the first
segment<sup>[145](footnote/fn11.htm#P1163_305993.md)</sup> of the world,
when afterwards the world had attained unto its completion, there came
down from above, for causes that we shall afterwards declare, in the
time of Herod a certain man called Christ, with a threefold nature, and
a threefold body, and a threefold power, (and) having in himself all
(species of) concretions and potentialities (derivable) from the three
divisions of the world; and that this, says (the Peratic), is what is
spoken: "It pleased him that in him should dwell all fulness
bodily,"<sup>[146](footnote/fn11.htm#P1164_306555.md)</sup> and in Him the
entire Divinity resides of the triad as thus divided. For, he says, that
from the two superjacent worlds-namely, from that (portion of the triad)
which is unbegotten, and from that which is self-producing-there have
been conveyed down into this world in which we are, seeds of all sorts
of potentialities. What, however, the mode of the descent is, we shall
afterwards declare.

(The Peratic) then says that Christ descended from above from
unorigination, that by His descent all things triply divided might be
saved. For some things, he says, being borne down from above, will
ascend through Him, whereas whatever (beings) form plots against those
which are carried down from above are cast
off,<sup>[147](footnote/fn11.htm#P1166_307328.md)</sup> and being placed in
a state of punishment, are renounced. This, he says, is what is spoken:
"For the Son of man came not into the world to destroy the world, but
that the world through Him might be saved." The world, he says, he
denominates those two parts that are situated above, viz., both the
unbegotten (portion of the triad), and the self-produced one. And when
Scripture, he says, uses the words, "that we may not be condemned with
the world," it alludes to the third portion of (the triad, that is) the
formal world. For the third portion, which he styles the world (in which
we are), must perish; but the two (remaining portions), which are
situated above, must be rescued from corruption.

Let us, then, in the first place, learn how (the Peratists), deriving
this doctrine from astrologers, act despitefully towards Christ, working
destruction for those who follow them in an error of this description.
For the astrologers, alleging that there is one world, divide it into
the twelve fixed portions of the zodiacal signs, and call the world of
the fixed zodiacal signs one immoveable world; and the other they affirm
to be a world of erratic (signs), both in power, and position, and
number, and that it extends as far as the
moon.<sup>[148](footnote/fn11.htm#P1170_309138.md)</sup> And (they lay
down), that (one) world derives from (the other) world a certain power,
and mutual participation (in that power), and that the subjacent obtain
this participation from the superjacent (portions). In order, however,
that what is (here) asserted may be perspicuous, I shall one by one
employ those very expressions of the astrologers; (and in doing so) I
shall only be reminding my readers of statements previously made in the
department of the work where we have explained the entire art of the
astrologers. What, then, the opinions are which those (speculators)
entertain, are as follow:-

(Their doctrine is), that from an emanation of the stars the generations
of the subjacent (parts) is consummated. For, as they wistfully gazed
upward upon heaven, the Chaldeans asserted that (the seven
stars)<sup>[149](footnote/fn11.htm#P1172_309984.md)</sup> contain a reason
for the efficient causes of the occurrence of all the events that happen
unto us, and that the parts of the fixed zodiacal signs co-operate (in
this influence). Into twelve (parts they divide the zodiacal circle),
and each zodiacal sign into thirty portions, and each portion into sixty
diminutive parts; for so they denominate the very smallest parts, and
those that are indivisible. And of the zodiacal signs, they term some
male, but others feminine; and some with two bodies, but others not so;
and some tropical, whereas others firm. The male signs, then, are either
feminine, which possess a co-operative nature for the procreation of
males, (or are themselves productive of females.) For Aries is a male
zodiacal sign, but Taurus female; and the rest (are denominated)
according to the same analogy, some male, but others female. And I
suppose that the Pythagoreans, being swayed from such (considerations),
style the Monad male, and the Duad female; and, again, the Triad male,
and analogically the remainder of the even and odd numbers. Some,
however, dividing each zodiacal sign into twelve parts, employ almost
the same method. For example, in Aries, they style the first of the
twelve parts both Aries and a male, but the second both Taurus and a
female, and the third both Gemini and a male; and the same plan is
pursued in the case of the rest of the parts. And they assert that there
are signs with two bodies, viz., Gemini and the signs diametrically
opposite, namely Sagittarius, and Virgo, and Pisces, and that the rest
have not two bodies. And (they state) that some are likewise tropical,
and when the sun stands in these, he causes great
turnings<sup>[150](footnote/fn11.htm#P1173_311732.md)</sup> of the
surrounding (sign). Aries is a sign of this description, and that which
is diametrically opposite to it, just as Libra, and Capricorn, and
Cancer. For in Aries is the vernal turning, and in Capricorn that of
winter, and in Cancer that of summer, and in Libra that of autumn.

The details, however, concerning this system we have minutely explained
in the book preceding this; and from it any one who wishes instruction
(on the point), may learn how it is that the originators of this Peratic
heresy, viz., Euphrates the Peratic, and Celbes the
Carystian,<sup>[151](footnote/fn11.htm#P1175_312348.md)</sup> have, in the
transference (into their own system of opinions from these sources),
made alterations in name only, while in reality they have put forward
similar tenets. (Nay more), they have, with immoderate zeal, themselves
devoted (their attention) to the art (of the astrologers). For also the
astrologers speak of the limits of the stars, in which they assert that
the dominant stars have greater influence; as, for instance, on some
they act injuriously, while on others they act well. And of these they
denominate some malicious, and some beneficent. And (stars) are said to
look upon one another, and to harmonize with each other, so that they
appear according to (the shape of) a triangle or square. The stars,
looking on one another, are figured according to (the shape
of<sup>[152](footnote/fn11.htm#P1176_313869)</sup> .md) a triangle, having
an intervening distance of the extent of three zodiacal signs; whereas
(those that have an interval of) two zodiacal signs are figured
according to (the shape of) a square. And (their doctrine is), that as
in the same way as in a man, the subjacent parts sympathize with the
head, and the head likewise sympathizes with the subjacent parts, so all
terrestrial (sympathize) with
super-lunar<sup>[153](footnote/fn11.htm#P1177_314354.md)</sup> objects. But
(the astrologers go further than
this<sup>[154](footnote/fn11.htm#P1178_314429)</sup> .md); for there exists
(according to them) a certain difference and
incompatibility<sup>[155](footnote/fn11.htm#P1179_314743.md)</sup> between
these, so as that they do not involve one and the same union. This
combination and divergence of the stars, which is a Chaldean (tenet),
has been arrogated to themselves by those of whom we have previously
spoken.

Now these, falsifying the name of truth, proclaim as a doctrine of
Christ an insurrection of Aeons and revolts of good into (the ranks of)
evil powers; and they speak of the confederations of good powers with
wicked ones. Denominating them, therefore, Toparchai and
Proastioi,<sup>[156](footnote/fn11.htm#P1181_315349.md)</sup> and (though
thus) framing for themselves very many other names not suggested (to
them from other sources), they have yet unskilfully systematized the
entire imaginary doctrine of the astrologers concerning the stars. And
since they have introduced a supposition pregnant with immense error,
they shall be refuted through the instrumentality of our admirable
arrangement. For I shall set down, in contrast with the previously
mentioned Chaldaic art of the astrologers, some of the
Peratic<sup>[157](footnote/fn11.htm#P1182_315888.md)</sup> treatises, from
which, by means of comparison, there will be an opportunity of
perceiving how the Peratic doctrines are those confessedly of the
astrologers, not of Christ.

It seems, then, expedient to set forth a certain one of the books
held<sup>[158](footnote/fn11.htm#P1186_316496.md)</sup> in repute amongst
them, in which the following
passage<sup>[159](footnote/fn11.htm#P1187_316784.md)</sup> occurs: "I am a
voice of arousal from slumber in the age of night. Henceforward I
commence to strip the power which is from chaos. The power is that of
the lowest depth of mud, which uprears the slime of the incorruptible
(and) humid expanse of space. And it is the entire power of the
convulsion, which, ever in motion, and presenting the colour of water,
whirls things on that are stationary, restrains things tremulous, sets
things free as they proceed,
lightens<sup>[160](footnote/fn11.htm#P1188_317629.md)</sup> things as they
abide, removes things on the increase, a faithful steward of the track
of the breezes, enjoying the things disgorged from the twelve eyes of
the law,<sup>[161](footnote/fn11.htm#P1189_317846)</sup> (and.md)
manifesting a seal<sup>[162](footnote/fn11.htm#P1190_318052.md)</sup> to
the power which along with itself distributes the downborne invisible
waters, and has been called Thalassa. This power ignorance has been
accustomed to denominate Cronus, guarded with chains because he tightly
bound the fold of the dense and misty and obscure and murky Tartarus.
According to the image of this were produced Cepheus, Prometheus, (and)
Japetus. The Power to which has been entrusted
Thalassa<sup>[163](footnote/fn11.htm#P1191_318555.md)</sup> is
hermaphrodite. And it fastens the hissing sound arising from the twelve
mouths into twelve pipes, and pours it forth. And the power itself is
subtle, and removes the controlling, boisterous, upward motion (of the
sea), and seals the tracks of its paths, lest (any antagonistic power)
should wage war or introduce, any alteration. The tempestuous daughter
of this one is a faithful protectress of all sorts of waters. Her name
is Chorzar. Ignorance is in the habit of styling this (power) Neptune,
according to whose image was produced Glaucus, Melicertes, Ino,
Nebroë.<sup>[164](footnote/fn11.htm#P1192_319585.md)</sup> He that is
encircled with the pyramid of twelve
angels,<sup>[165](footnote/fn11.htm#P1193_319685.md)</sup> and darkens the
gate into the pyramid with various colours, and completes the entire in
the sable hues of Night: this one ignorance denominated
Cronus.<sup>[166](footnote/fn11.htm#P1194_319913.md)</sup> And his
ministers were five,-first U, second Aoai, third Uo, fourth Uoab, fifth
... Other trustworthy managers (there are) of his province of night and
day, who repose in their own power. Ignorance denominated these the
erratic stars, from whom depends a corruptible generation. Manager of
the rising of the star<sup>[167](footnote/fn11.htm#P1195_320249.md)</sup>
is Carphacasemeocheir, (and) Eccabbacara (is the same). Ignorance is in
the habit of denominating these Curetes chief of the winds; third in
order is Ariel, according to whose image was generated Aeolus, Briares.
And chief of the twelve-houred nocturnal (power) is Soclan, whom
ignorance is accustomed to style Osiris; (and) according to the image of
this one was born Admetus, Medea, Helen, Aethusa. Chief of the
twelve-houred diurnal power is Euno. This is manager of the rising of
the star Protocamarus and of the ethereal (region), but ignorance has
denominated him Isis. A sign of this one is the Dog-star, according to
whose image were born Ptolemaeus son of Arsinoe, Didyma, Cleopatra, and
Olympias. God's right-hand power is that which ignorance has denominated
Rhea, according to whose image were produced Attis,
Mygdon,<sup>[168](footnote/fn11.htm#P1196_321097)</sup> (and.md) Oenone.
The left-hand power has lordship over sustenance, and ignorance is in
the habit of styling this Ceres, (while) her name is Bena; and according
to the image of this one were born Celeus, Triptolemus, Misyr, and
Praxidica.<sup>[169](footnote/fn11.htm#P1197_321378.md)</sup> The
right-hand power has lordship over fruits. This one ignorance has
denominated Mena, according to whose image were born
Bumegas,<sup>[170](footnote/fn11.htm#P1198_321537.md)</sup> Ostanes,
Mercury Trismegistus, Curites, Petosiris, Zodarium, Berosus,
Astrampsuchus, (and) Zoroaster. The left-hand power is (lord) of fire,
(and) ignorance has denominated this one Vulcan, according to whose
image were born Ericthonius, Achilles, Capaneus,
Phaëthon,<sup>[171](footnote/fn11.htm#P1199_321838.md)</sup> Meleager,
Tydeus, Enceladus, Raphael, Suriel, (and) Omphale. There are three
intermediate powers suspended from air, authors of generation. These
ignorance has been in the habit of denominating Fates; and according to
the image of these were produced the house of Priam, the house of Laius,
Ino, Autonoe, Agave, Athamas, Procne, Danaides, and Peliades. A power
(there is) hermaphrodite, always continuing in infancy, never waxing
old, cause of beauty, pleasure, maturity, desire, and concupiscence; and
ignorance has been accustomed to style this Eros, according to whose
image were born Paris, Narcissus, Ganymede, Endymion, Tithonus, Icarius,
Leda, Amymone, Thetis, Hesperides, Jason, Leander, (and) Hero." These
are Proastioi up to Aether, for with this title also he inscribes the
book.

It has been easily made evident to all, that the heresy of the Peratae
is altered in name only from the (art) of the astrologers. And the rest
of the books of these (heretics) contain the same method, if it were
agreeable to any one to wade through them all. For, as I said, they
suppose that the causes of the generation of all begotten things are
things unbegotten and superjacent, and that the world with us has been
produced after the mode of emanation, which (world) they denominate
formal. And (they maintain) that all those stars together which are
beheld in the firmament have been causes of the generation of this
world. They have, however, altered the name of these, as one may
perceive from the Proastioi by means of a comparison (of the two
systems). And secondly, according to the same method as that whereby the
world was made from a supernal emanation, they affirm that in this
manner objects here derive from the emanation of the stars their
generation, and corruption, and arrangement. Since, then, astrologers
are acquainted with the horoscope, and meridian, and setting, and the
point opposite the meridian; and since these stars occupy at different
times different positions<sup>[172](footnote/fn12.md)</sup> in space, on
account of the perpetual revolution of the universe, there are
(necessarily) at different periods different declinations towards a
centre, and (different) ascensions to
centres.<sup>[173](footnote/fn12.htm#P1204_324218.md)</sup> (Now the
Peratic here-ties), affixing an allegorical import to this arrangement
of the astrologers, delineate the centre, as it were, a god and monad
and lord over universal generation, whereas the declination (is regarded
by them as a power) on the left, and ascension on the right. When any
one, therefore, falling in with the treatises of these (heretics), finds
mention among them of right or left power, let him recur to the centre,
and the declination, and the ascension (of the Chaldean sages, and) he
will clearly observe that the entire system of these (Peratae) consists
of the astrological doctrine.

They denominate themselves, however, Peratae, imagining that none of
those things existing by generation can escape the determined lot for
those things that derive their existence from generation. For if, says
(the Peratic), anything be altogether begotten, it also perishes, as
also is the opinion of the
Sibyl.<sup>[174](footnote/fn12.htm#P1208_325465.md)</sup> But we alone, he
says, who are conversant with the necessity of generation, and the paths
through which man has entered into the world, and who have been
accurately instructed (in these matters), we alone are competent to
proceed through and pass beyond
destruction.<sup>[175](footnote/fn12.htm#P1209_325781.md)</sup> But water,
he says, is destruction; nor did the world, he says, perish by any other
thing quicker than by water. Water, however, is that which rolls around
among the Proastioi, (and) they assert (it to be) Cronus. For such a
power, he says, is of the colour of water; and this power, he says-that
is, Cronus-none of those things existent by generation can escape. For
Cronus is a cause to every generation, in regard of succumbing under
destruction, and there could not exist (an instance of) generation in
which Cronus does not interfere. This, he says, is what the poets also
affirm, and what even appals the gods:-

And not only, he says, do the poets make this statement, but already
also the very wisest men among the Greeks. And Heraclitus is even one of
these, employing the following words: "For to souls water becomes
death." This death, (the Peratic) says, seizes the Egyptians in the Red
Sea, along with their chariots. All, however, who are ignorant (of this
fact), he says, are Egyptians. And this, they assert, is the departure
from Egypt, (that is,) from the body. For they suppose little Egypt to
be body, and that it crosses the Red Sea-that is, the water of
corruption, which is Cronus-and that it reaches a place beyond the Red
Sea, that is, generation; and that it comes into the wilderness, that
is, that it attains a condition independent of generation, where there
exist promiscuously all the gods of destruction and the God of
salvation.

Now, he says, the stars are the gods of destruction, which impose upon
existent things the necessity of alterable generation. These, he says,
Moses denominated serpents of the wilderness, which gnaw and utterly
ruin those who imagined that they had crossed the Red Sea. To those,
then, he says, who of the children of Israel were bitten in the
wilderness, Moses exhibited the real and perfect serpent; and they who
believed on this serpent were not bitten in the wilderness, that is,
(were not assailed) by (evil) powers. No one therefore, he says, is
there who is able to save and deliver those that come forth from Egypt,
that is, from the body and from this world, unless alone the serpent
that is perfect and replete with fulness. Upon this (serpent), he says,
he who fixes his hope is not destroyed by the snakes of the wilderness,
that is, by the gods of generation. (This statement) is written, he
says, in a book of Moses. This serpent, he says, is the power that
attended Moses,<sup>[176](footnote/fn12.htm#P1215_328828.md)</sup> the rod
that was turned into a serpent. The serpents, however, of the
magicians-(that is,) the gods of destruction-withstood the power of
Moses in Egypt, but the rod of Moses reduced them all to subjection and
slew them. This universal serpent is, he says, the wise discourse of
Eve. This, he says, is the mystery of Edem, this the river of Edem; this
the mark that was set upon Cain, that any one who findeth him might not
kill him. This, he says,<sup>[177](footnote/fn12.htm#P1216_329324.md)</sup>
is Cain,<sup>[178](footnote/fn12.htm#P1217_329356.md)</sup> whose
sacrifice<sup>[179](footnote/fn12.htm#P1218_329393.md)</sup> the god of
this world did not accept. The gory sacrifice, however, of Abel he
approved of; for the ruler of this world rejoices in (offerings of)
blood. This, he says, is he who appeared in the last days, in form of a
man, in the times of Herod, being born after the likeness of Joseph, who
was sold by the hand of his brethren, to whom alone belonged the coat of
many colours. This, he says, is he who is according to the likeness of
Esau, whose garment-he not being himself present-was blessed; who did
not receive, he says, the benediction uttered by him of enfeebled
vision.<sup>[180](footnote/fn12.htm#P1219_329992.md)</sup> He acquired,
however, wealth from a source independent of this, receiving nothing
from him whose eyes were dim; and Jacob saw his
countenance,<sup>[181](footnote/fn12.htm#P1220_330157.md)</sup> as a man
beholds the face of God. In regard of this, he says, it has been written
that "Nebrod was a mighty hunter before the
Lord."<sup>[182](footnote/fn12.htm#P1221_330314.md)</sup> And there are, he
says, many who closely imitate this (Nimrod): as numerous are they as
the gnawing (serpents) which were seen in the wilderness by the children
of Israel, from which that perfect serpent which Moses set up delivered
those that were bitten. This, he says, is that which has been declared:
"In the same manner as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so
also must the Son of man be lifted
up."<sup>[183](footnote/fn12.htm#P1222_330750.md)</sup> According to the
likeness of this was made in the desert the brazen serpent which Moses
set up. Of this alone, he says, the image is in heaven, always
conspicuous in light.

This, he says, is the great beginning respecting which Scripture has
spoken. Concerning this, he says it has been declared: "In the beginning
was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. This was
in the beginning with God, all things were made by Him, and without Him
was not one thing that was made. And what was formed in Him is
life."<sup>[184](footnote/fn12.htm#P1224_331303.md)</sup> And in Him, he
says, has been formed Eve; (now) Eve is life. This, however, he says, is
Eve, mother of all
living,<sup>[185](footnote/fn12.htm#P1225_331438.md)</sup> -a common
nature, that is, of gods, angels, immortals, mortals, irrational
creatures, (and) rational ones. For, he says, the expression "all" he
uttered of all (existences). And if the eyes of any, he says, are
blessed, this one, looking upward on the firmament, will behold at the
mighty summit<sup>[186](footnote/fn12.htm#P1226_331849.md)</sup> of heaven
the beauteous image of the serpent, turning itself, and becoming an
originating principle of every (species of) motion to all things that
are being produced. He will (thereby) know that without him nothing
consists, either of things in heaven, or things on earth. or things
under the earth. Not night, not moon, not fruits, not generation, not
wealth, not sustenance, not anything at all of existent things, is
without his guidance. In regard of this, he says, is the great wonder
which is beheld in the firmament by those who are able to observe it.
For, he says, at this top of his head, a fact which is more incredible
than all things to those who are ignorant, "are setting and rising
mingled one with other." This it is in regard of which ignorance is in
the habit of affirming: in heaven

And on both sides of him have been placed Corona and Lyra; and above,
near the top itself of the head, is visible the piteous man "Engonasis,"

And at the back of Engonasis is an imperfect serpent, with both hands
tightly secured by Anguitenens, and being hindered from touching Corona
that lies beside the perfect serpent.

This is the diversified wisdom of the Peratic heresy, which it is
difficult to declare in its entirety, so intricate is it on account of
its seeming to consist of the astrological art.' As far forth, then, as
this is possible, we shall briefly explain the whole force of this
(heresy). In order, however, that we may by a compendious statement
elucidate the entire doctrine of these persons, it appears expedient to
subjoin the following observations. According to them, the universe is
Father, Son, (and) Matter; (but) each of these three has endless
capacities in itself. Intermediate, then, between the Matter and the
Father sits the Son, the Word, the Serpent, always being in motion
towards the unmoved Father, and (towards) Matter itself in motion. And
at one time he is turned towards the Father, and receives the powers
into his own person; but at another time takes up these powers, and is
turned towards Matter. And Matter, (though) devoid of attribute, and
being unfashioned, moulds (into itself) forms from the Son which the Son
moulded from the Father.

But the Son derives shape from the Father after a mode ineffable, and
unspeakable, and unchangeable; (that is,) in such a manner as Moses says
that tire colours of the conceived (kine) flowed from the
rods<sup>[189](footnote/fn12.htm#P1237_334523.md)</sup> which were fixed in
the drinking-troughs. And in like manner, again, that capacities flowed
also from the Son into Matter, similarly to the power in reference to
conception which came from the rods upon the conceived (kine). And the
difference of colours, and the dissimilarity which flowed from the rods
through the waters upon the sheep, is, he says, the difference of
corruptible and incorruptible generation. As, however, one who paints
from nature, though he takes nothing away from animals, transfers by his
pencil all forms to the canvas; so the Son, by a power which belongs to
himself, transfers paternal marks from the Father into Matter. All the
paternal marks are here, and there are not any more. For if any one, he
says, of those (beings) which are here will have strength to perceive
that he is a paternal mark transferred hither from above, (and that he
is) incarnate-just as by the conception resulting from the rod a
something white is produced,-he is of the same substance altogether with
the Father in heaven, and returns thither. If, however, he may not
happen upon this doctrine, neither will he understand the necessity of
generation, just as an abortion born at night will perish at night.
When, therefore, he says, the Saviour observes, "your Father which is in
heaven,"<sup>[190](footnote/fn12.htm#P1238_335844.md)</sup> he alludes to
that one from whom the Son deriving his characteristics has transferred
them hither. When, however, (Jesus) remarks, "Your father is a murderer
from the beginning,"<sup>[191](footnote/fn12.htm#P1239_336046.md)</sup> he
alludes to the Ruler and Demiurge of matter, who, appropriating the
marks delivered from the Son, generated him here who from the beginning
was a murderer, for his work causes corruption and death.

No one, then, he says, can be saved or return (into heaven) without the
Son, and the Son is the Serpent. For as he brought down from above the
paternal marks, so again he carries up from thence those marks roused
from a dormant condition and rendered paternal characteristics,
substantial ones from the unsubstantial Being, transferring them hither
from thence. This, he says, is what is spoken: "I am the
door."<sup>[192](footnote/fn12.htm#P1241_336681.md)</sup> And he transfers
(those marks), he says,<sup>[193](footnote/fn12.htm#P1242_336740.md)</sup>
to those who close the eyelid, as the naphtha drawing the fire in every
direction towards itself; nay rather, as the magnet (attracting) the
iron and not anything else, or just as the backbone of the sea falcon,
the gold and nothing else, or as the chaff is led by the amber. In this
manner, he says, is the portrayed, perfect, and con-substantial genus
drawn again from the world by the Serpent; nor does he (attract)
anything else, as it has been sent down by him. For a proof of this,
they adduce the anatomy<sup>[194](footnote/fn12.htm#P1243_337587.md)</sup>
of the brain, assimilating, from the fact of its immobility, the brain
itself to the Father, and the cerebellum to the Son, because of its
being moved and being of the form of (the head of) a serpent. And they
allege that this (cerebellum), by an ineffable and inscrutable process,
attracts through the pineal gland the spiritual and life-giving
substance emanating from the vaulted
chamber<sup>[195](footnote/fn12.htm#P1244_338074.md)</sup> (in which the
brain is embedded). And on receiving this, the cerebellum in an
ineffable manner imparts the ideas, just as the Son does, to matter; or,
in other words, the seeds and the genera of the things produced
according to the flesh flow along into the spinal marrow. Employing this
exemplar, (the heretics) seem to adroitly introduce their secret
mysteries, which are delivered in silence. Now it would be impious for
us to declare these; yet it is easy to form an idea of them, by reason
of the many statements that have been made.

But since I consider that I have plainly explained the Peratic heresy,
and by many (arguments) have rendered evident (a system that hitherto)
has always escaped notice, and is
altogether<sup>[196](footnote/fn12.htm#P1248_338945.md)</sup> a tissue of
fable, and one that disguises its own peculiar venom, it seems expedient
to advance no further statement beyond those already put forward; for
the opinions propounded by (the heretics) themselves are sufficient for
their own condemnation.

Let us then see what the
Sithians<sup>[197](footnote/fn12.htm#P1252_339484.md)</sup> affirm. To
these it appears that there are three definite principles of the
universe, and that each of these principles possesses infinite powers.
And when they speak of
powers<sup>[198](footnote/fn12.htm#P1253_340036.md)</sup> let him that
heareth take into account that they make this statement. Everything
whatsoever you discern by an act of intelligence, or also omit (to
discern) as not being understood, this by nature is fitted to become
each of the principles, as in the human soul every art whatsoever which
is made the subject of instruction. Just for instance, he says, this
child will be a musician, having waited the requisite time for
(acquiring a knowledge of) the harp; or a geometrician, (having
previously undergone the necessary study for acquiring a knowledge) of
geometry; (or) a grammarian, (after having sufficiently studied)
grammar; (or) a workman, (having acquired a practical acquaintance) with
a handicraftsman's business; and to one brought into contact with the
rest of the arts a similar occurrence will take place. Now of
principles, he says, the substances are light and darkness; and of
these, spirit is intermediate without admixture. The spirit, however, is
that which has its appointed place in the midst of darkness which is
below, and light which is above. It is not spirit as a current of wind,
or some gentle breeze that can be felt; but, as it were, some odour of
ointment or of incense formed out of a compound. (It is) a subtle power,
that insinuates itself by means of some impulsive quality in a
fragrance, which is inconceivable and better than could be expressed by
words. Since, however, light is above and darkness below, and spirit is
intermediate in such a way as stated between these; and since light is
so constituted, that, like a ray of the sun, it shines from above upon
the underlying darkness; and again, since the fragrance of the spirit,
holding an intermediate place, is extended and carried in every
direction, as in the case of incense-offerings placed upon fire, we
detect the fragrance that is being wafted in every direction: when, I
say, there is a power of this description belonging unto the principles
which are classified under three divisions, the power of spirit and
light simultaneously exists in the darkness that is situated underneath
them. But the darkness is a terrible water, into which light is absorbed
and translated into a nature of the same description with spirit. The
darkness, however, is not devoid of intelligence, but altogether
reflective, and is conscious that, where the light has been abstracted
from the darkness, the darkness remains isolated, invisible, obscure,
impotent, inoperative, (and) feeble. Wherefore it is constrained, by all
its reflection and understanding, to collect into itself the lustre and
scintillation of light with the fragrance of the spirit. And it is
possible to behold an image of the nature of these in the human
countenance; for instance, the pupil of the eye, dark from the subjacent
humours, (but) illuminated with spirit. As, then, the darkness seeks
after the splendour, that it may keep in bondage the spark, and may have
perceptive power, so the light and spirit seek after the power that
belongs to themselves, and strive to uprear, and towards each other to
carry up their intermingled powers into the dark and formidable water
lying underneath.

But all the powers of the three originating principles, which are as
regards number indefinitely infinite, are each according to its own
substance reflective and intelligent, unnumbered in multitude. And since
what are reflective and intelligent are numberless in multitude, while
they continue by themselves, they are all at rest. If, however, power
approaches power, the dissimilarity of (what is set in) juxtaposition
produces a certain motion and energy, which are formed from the motion
resulting from the concourse effected by the juxtaposition of the
coalescing powers. For the concourse of the powers ensues, just like any
mark of a seal<sup>[199](footnote/fn12.htm#P1255_343974.md)</sup> that is
impressed by means of the concourse correspondingly with (the seal)
which prints the figure on the substances that are brought up (into
contact with it). Since, therefore, the powers of the three principles
are infinite in number, and from infinite powers (arise) infinite
concourses, images of infinite seals are necessarily produced. These
images, therefore, are the forms of the different sorts of animals. From
the first great concourse, then, of the three principles, ensues a
certain great form, a seal of heaven and earth. The heaven and the earth
have a figure similar to the womb, having a navel in the midst; and if,
he says, any one is desirous of bringing this figure under the organ of
vision, let him artfully scrutinize the pregnant womb of whatsoever
animal he wishes, and he will discover an image of the heaven and the
earth, and of the things which in the midst of all are unalterably
situated underneath.

(And so it is, that the first great concourse of the three principles)
has produced such a figure of heaven and earth as is similar to a womb
after the first coition. But, again, in the midst of the heaven and the
earth have been generated infinite concourses of powers. And each
concourse did not effect and fashion anything else than a seal of heaven
and earth similar to a womb. But, again, in the earth, from the infinite
seals are produced infinite crowds of various animals. But into all this
infinity of the different animals under heaven is diffused and
distributed, along with the light, the fragrance of the Spirit from
above. From the water, therefore, has been produced a first-begotten
originating principle, viz., wind, (which is) violent and boisterous,
and a cause of all generation. For producing a sort of ferment in the
waters, (the wind) uplifts waves out of the waters; and the
motion<sup>[200](footnote/fn12.htm#P1257_345841.md)</sup> of the waves,
just as when some impulsive power of pregnancy is the origin of the
production of a man or
mind,<sup>[201](footnote/fn12.htm#P1258_345977.md)</sup> is caused when
(the ocean), excited by the impulsive power of spirit, is propelled
forward. When, however, this wave that has been raised out of the water
by the wind, and rendered pregnant in its nature, has within itself
obtained the power, possessed by the female, of generation, it holds
together the light scattered from above along with the fragrance of the
spirit-that is, mind moulded in the different species. And this (light)
is a perfect God, who from the unbegotten radiance above, and from the
spirit, is borne down into human nature as into a temple, by the
impulsive power of Nature, and by the motion of wind. And it is produced
from water being
commingled<sup>[202](footnote/fn12.htm#P1259_346728.md)</sup> and blended
with bodies as if it were a
salt<sup>[203](footnote/fn12.htm#P1260_346797.md)</sup> of existent things,
and a light of darkness. And it struggles to be released from bodies,
and is not able to find liberation and an egress for itself For a very
diminutive spark, a severed splinter from above like the ray of a star,
has been mingled in the much compounded waters of many
(existences),<sup>[204](footnote/fn12.htm#P1261_347147.md)</sup> as, says
he, (David) remarks in a
psalm.<sup>[205](footnote/fn12.htm#P1262_347537.md)</sup> Every thought,
then, and solicitude actuating the supernal light is as to how and in
what manner mind may be liberated, by the death of the depraved and dark
body, from the Father that is below, which is the wind that with
noise<sup>[206](footnote/fn12.htm#P1263_347787.md)</sup> and tumult
uplifted the waves, and who generated a perfect mind his own Son; not,
however, being his peculiar (offspring) substantially. For he was a ray
(sent down) from above, from that perfect light, (and) was overpowered
in the dark,<sup>[207](footnote/fn12.htm#P1264_348098.md)</sup> and
formidable, and bitter, and defiled water; and he is a luminous spirit
borne down over the
water.<sup>[208](footnote/fn12.htm#P1265_348297.md)</sup> When, therefore,
the waves that have been upreared from the waters have received within
themselves the power of generation possessed by females, they contain,
as a certain womb, in different species, the infused radiance, so as
that it is visible in the case of all
animals.<sup>[209](footnote/fn12.htm#P1266_348596.md)</sup> But the wind,
at the same time fierce and
formidable,<sup>[210](footnote/fn12.htm#P1267_348777.md)</sup> whirling
along, is, in respect of its hissing sound, like a
serpent.<sup>[211](footnote/fn12.htm#P1268_348867.md)</sup>

First, then, from the wind-that is, from the serpent-has resulted the
originating principle of generation in the manner declared, all things
having simultaneously received the principle of generation. After, then,
the light and the spirit had been received, he says, into the polluted
and baneful (and) disordered womb, the serpent-the wind of the darkness,
the first-begotten of the waters-enters within and produces man, and the
impure womb neither loves nor recognises any other form. The perfect
Word of supernal light being therefore assimilated (in form) to the
beast, (that is,) the serpent, entered into the defiled womb, having
deceived (the womb) through the similitude of the beast itself, in order
that (the Word) may loose the chains that encircle the perfect mind
which has been begotten amidst impurity of womb by the primal offspring
of water, (namely,) serpent, wind, (and)
beast.<sup>[212](footnote/fn12.htm#P1270_350094.md)</sup> This, he says, is
the form of the servant,<sup>[213](footnote/fn12.htm#P1271_350236.md)</sup>
and this the necessity of the Word of God coming down into the womb of a
virgin. But he says it is not sufficient that the Perfect Man, the Word,
has entered into the womb of a virgin, and loosed the
pangs<sup>[214](footnote/fn12.htm#P1272_350462.md)</sup> which were in that
darkness. Nay, more than this was requisite; for after his
entrance<sup>[215](footnote/fn12.htm#P1273_350569.md)</sup> into the foul
mysteries of the womb, he was washed, and drank of the cup of
life-giving bubbling
water.<sup>[216](footnote/fn12.htm#P1274_350777.md)</sup> And it was
altogether needful that he should drink who was about to strip off the
servile form, and assume celestial raiment.

These are the statements which the
patrons<sup>[217](footnote/fn12.htm#P1278_351242.md)</sup> of the Sethian
doctrines make, as far as it is possible to declare in a few words.
Their system, however, is made up (of tenets) from natural
(philosophers), and of expressions uttered in reference to different
other subjects; and transferring (the sense of) these to the
Eternal<sup>[218](footnote/fn12.htm#P1279_351849.md)</sup> Logos, they
explain them as we have declared. But they assert likewise that Moses
confirms their doctrine when he says, "Darkness, and mist, and tempest."
These, (the Sethian) says, are the three principles (of our system); or
when he states that three were born in paradise-Adam, Eve, the serpent;
or when he speaks of three (persons, namely) Cain, Abel, Seth; and again
of three (others)-Shem,
Ham,<sup>[219](footnote/fn12.htm#P1280_352285.md)</sup> Japheth; or when he
mentions three patriarchs-Abraham, Isaac, Jacob; or when he speaks of
the existence of three days before sun and moon; or when he mentions
three laws-prohibitory, permissive, and adjudicatory of punishment. Now,
a prohibitory law is as follows: "Of every tree that is in paradise thou
mayest freely eat; but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
thou mayest not eat."<sup>[220](footnote/fn12.htm#P1281_352720.md)</sup>
But in the passage, "Come forth from thy land and from thy kindred, and
hither into a land which I shall show
thee,"<sup>[221](footnote/fn12.htm#P1282_352861.md)</sup> this law, he
says, is permissive; for one who is so disposed may depart, and one who
is not so disposed may remain. But a law adjudicatory of punishment is
that which makes the following declaration: "Thou shall not commit
adultery, thou shall not kill, thou shall not steal;
"<sup>[222](footnote/fn12.htm#P1283_353159.md)</sup> for a penalty is
awarded to each of these acts of wickedness.

The entire system of their doctrine, however, is (derived)
from<sup>[223](footnote/fn12.htm#P1285_353322.md)</sup> the ancient
theologians Musaeus, and Linus, and
Orpheus,<sup>[224](footnote/fn12.htm#P1286_353399.md)</sup> who elucidates
especially the ceremonies of initiation, as well as the mysteries
themselves. For their doctrine concerning the womb is also the tenet of
Orpheus; and the (idea of the)
navel,<sup>[225](footnote/fn12.htm#P1287_353954.md)</sup> which is
harmony,<sup>[226](footnote/fn12.htm#P1288_354379.md)</sup> is (to be
found) with the same symbolism attached to it in the Bacchanalian orgies
of Orpheus. But prior to the observance of the mystic rite of Celeus,
and Triptolemus, and Ceres, and Proserpine, and Bacchus in Eleusis,
these orgies have been celebrated and handed down to men in Phlium of
Attica.<sup>[227](footnote/fn12.htm#P1289_354831.md)</sup> For antecedent
to the Eleusinian mysteries, there are (enacted) in Phlium the
orgies<sup>[228](footnote/fn12.htm#P1290_354972.md)</sup> of her
denominated the "Great (Mother)." There is, however, a portico in this
(city), and on the portico is inscribed a representation, (visible) up
to the present day, of all the words which are spoken (on such
occasions). Many, then, of the words inscribed upon that portico are
those respecting which Plutarch institutes discussions in his ten books
against<sup>[229](footnote/fn12.htm#P1291_355634.md)</sup> Empedocles. And
in the greater<sup>[230](footnote/fn12.htm#P1292_355853.md)</sup> number of
these books is also drawn the representation of a certain aged man,
grey-haired, winged,<sup>[231](footnote/fn12.htm#P1293_356011.md)</sup>
having his *pudendum erectum*, pursuing a retreating woman of azure
colour.<sup>[232](footnote/fn12.htm#P1294_356295.md)</sup> And over the
aged man is the inscription "phaos ruentes," and over the woman
"pereeµphicola."<sup>[233](footnote/fn12.htm#P1295_356445.md)</sup> But
"phaos ruentes"<sup>[234](footnote/fn12.htm#P1296_356513.md)</sup> appears
to be the light (which exists), according to the doctrine of the
Sethians, and "phicola" the darkish water; while the space in the midst
of these seems to be a harmony constituted from the spirit that is
placed between. The name, however, of "phaos ruentes" manifests, as they
allege, the flow from above of the light downwards. Wherefore one may
reasonably assert that the Sethians celebrate rites among themselves,
very closely bordering upon those orgies of the "Great (Mother" which
are observed among) the Phliasians. And the poet likewise seems to bear
his testimony to this triple division, when he remarks, "And all things
have been triply divided, and everything obtains its (proper)
distinction; "<sup>[235](footnote/fn12.htm#P1297_357352.md)</sup> that is,
each member of the threefold division has obtained (a particular)
capacity. But now, as regards the tenet that the subjacent water below,
which is dark, ought, because the light has set (over it), to convey
upwards and receive the spark borne clown from (the light) itself; in
the assertion of this tenet. I say, the all-wise Sethians appear to
derive (their opinion) from Homer:-

That is, according to Homer, the gods suppose water to be loathsome and
horrible. Now, similar to this is the doctrine of the Sethians, which
affirms (water) to be formidable to the
mind.<sup>[237](footnote/fn13.htm#P1303_358238.md)</sup>

These, and other assertions similar to these, are made (by the Sethians)
in their interminable commentaries. They, however, persuade their
disciples to become conversant with the theory respecting composition
and mixture. But this theory has formed a subject of meditation to many,
but (among others) also to Andronicus the Peripatetic. The Sethians,
then, affirm that the theory concerning composition and mixture is
constituted according to the following method: The luminous ray from
above is intermingled, and the very diminutive spark is delicately
blended in the dark waters beneath; and (both of these) become united,
and are formed into one compound mass, just as a single savour (results)
from the mixture of many incense-offerings in the fire, and (just as) an
adept, by having a test in an acute sense of smell, ought to be able
from the single odour of the incense to distinguish accurately each
(ingredient) of the incense-offerings that have been mingled in the
fire,-whether, for example, storax, and myrrh, and frankincense, or
whatever other (ingredient) may be mixed (in the incense). They,
however, employ also other examples, saying both that brass is mixed
with gold, and that some art has been discovered which separates the
brass from the gold. And, in like manner, if tin or brass, or any
substance homogeneous with it, be discovered mixed with silver, these
likewise, by some art superior to that of mixing, are distinguished. But
already some one also distinguishes water mingled with
wine.<sup>[238](footnote/fn13.htm#P1307_360009.md)</sup> So, say they,
though all things are commingled, they are capable of being separated.
Nay, but, he says, derive the same lesson from the case of animals. For
when the animal is dead, each of its parts is separated; and when
dissolution takes place, the animal in this way vanishes. This is, he
says, what has been spoken: "I came not to send peace on the earth, but
a sword,"<sup>[239](footnote/fn13.htm#P1308_360702.md)</sup> -that is, the
division and separation of the things that have been commingled. For
each of the things that have been commingled is separated and divided
when it reaches its proper place. For as there is one place of mixture
for all animals, so also has there been established one (locality) of
separation. And, he says, no one is aware of this (place), save we alone
that have been born again, spiritual, not carnal, whose citizenship is
in heaven above.

In this manner insinuating themselves, they corrupt their pupils, partly
by misusing the words spoken (by themselves), while they wickedly
pervert, to serve any purpose they wish, what has been admirably said
(in Scripture); and partly by concealing their nefarious conduct, by
means of whatever comparisons they please. All these things, then, he
says, that have been com-mingled, possess, as has been declared, their
own particular place, and hurry towards their own peculiar (substances),
as iron towards the magnet, and the chaff to the vicinity of amber, and
the gold to the spur<sup>[240](footnote/fn13.htm#P1310_361762.md)</sup> of
the sea falcon. In like manner, the
*ray*<sup>[241](footnote/fn13.htm#P1311_361881.md)</sup> of light which has
been com-mingled with the water, having obtained from discipline and
instruction its own proper locality, hastens towards the Logos that
comes from above in servile form; and along with the Logos exists as a
logos in that place where the Logos is still: (the light, I say, hastens
to the Logos with greater speed) than the iron towards the magnet.

And that these things, he says, are so, and that all things that have
been commingled are separated in their proper places, learn. There is
among the Persians in a city
Ampa,<sup>[242](footnote/fn13.htm#P1313_362441.md)</sup> near the river
Tills, a well; and near the well, at the top, has been constructed a
certain reservoir, supplied with three outlets; and when one pumps from
this well, and draws off some of its contents in a vessel, what is thus
pumped out of the well, whatever it is at all, he pours into the
reservoir hard by. And when what is thus infused reaches the outlets,
and when what is taken up (out of each outlet) in a single vessel is
examined, a separation is observed to have taken place. And in the first
of the outlets is exhibited a concretion of salt, and in the second of
asphalt, and in the third of oil; and the oil is black, just as, he
says, Herodotus<sup>[243](footnote/fn13.htm#P1314_363119.md)</sup> also
narrates, and it yields a heavy smell, and the Persians call this
"rhadinace." The similitude of the well is, say the Sethians, more
sufficient for the demonstration of their proposition than all the
statements that have been previously made.

The opinion of the Sethians appears to us to have been sufficiently
elucidated. If, however, any one is desirous of learning the entire
doctrine according to them, let him read a book inscribed *Paraphrase of
Seth*; for all their secret tenets he will find deposited there. But
since we have explained the opinions entertained by the Sethians, let us
see also what are the doctrines advanced by Justinus.

Justinus<sup>[244](footnote/fn13.htm#P1321_363961.md)</sup> was entirely
opposed to the teaching of the holy Scriptures, and moreover to the
written or oral teaching of the blessed evangelists, according as the
Logos was accustomed to instruct His disciples, saying, "Go not into the
way of the Gentiles; "<sup>[245](footnote/fn13.htm#P1322_365350.md)</sup>
and this signifies that they should not attend to the futile doctrine of
the Gentiles. This (heretic) endeavours to lead on his hearers into an
acknowledgment of prodigies detailed by the Gentiles, and of doctrines
inculcated by them. And he narrates, word for word, legendary accounts
prevalent among the Greeks, and does not previously teach or deliver his
perfect mystery, unless he has bound his dupe by an oath. Then he brings
forward (these) fables for the purpose of persuasion, in order that they
who are conversant with the incalculable trifling of these books may
have some consolation in the details of these legends. Thus it happens
as when in like manner one making a long journey deems it expedient, on
having fallen in with an inn, to take repose. And so it is that, when
once more they are induced to turn towards studying the diffuse doctrine
of these lectures, they may not abhor them while they, undergoing
instruction unnecessarily prolix, rush stupified into the transgression
devised by (Justinus); and previously he binds his followers with
horrible oaths, neither to publish nor abjure these doctrines, and
forces upon them an acknowledgment (of their truth). And in this manner
he delivers the mysteries impiously discovered by himself, partly,
according to the statements previously made, availing himself of the
Hellenic legends, and partly of those pretended books which, to some
extent, bear a resemblance to the foresaid heresies. For all, forced
together by one spirit, are drawn into one profound abyss of pollution,
inculcating the same tenets, and detailing the same legends, each after
a different method. All those, however, style themselves Gnostics in
this peculiar sense, that they alone themselves have imbibed the
marvellous knowledge of the Perfect and Good (Being).

But swear, says Justinus, if you wish to know "what eye hath not seen,
and ear hath not heard, and the things which have not entered into the
heart; "<sup>[246](footnote/fn13.htm#P1326_367396.md)</sup> that is, if you
wish to know Him who is good above all, Him who is more exalted, (swear)
that you will preserve the secrets (of the Justinian) discipline, as
intended to be kept silent. For also our Father, on beholding the Good
One, and on being initiated with Him, preserved the mysteries respecting
which silence is enjoined, and sware, as it has been written, "The Lord
sware, and will not
repent."<sup>[247](footnote/fn13.htm#P1327_367834.md)</sup> Having, then,
in this way set the seal to these tenets, he seeks to inveigle (his
followers) with more legends, (which are detailed) through a greater
number of books; and so he conducts (his readers) to the Good One,
consummating the initiated (by admitting them into) the unspeakable
Mysteries.<sup>[248](footnote/fn13.htm#P1328_368163.md)</sup> In order,
however, that we may not wade through more of their volumes, we shall
illustrate the ineffable Mysteries (of Justinus) from one book of his,
inasmuch as, according to his supposition, it is (a work) of high
repute. Now this volume is inscribed Baruch; and one fabulous account
out of many which is explained by (Justinus) in this (volume), we shall
point out, inasmuch as it is to be found in Herodotus. But after
imparting a different shape to this (account), he explains it to his
pupils as if it were something novel, being under the impression that
the entire arrangement of his doctrine (springs) out of it.

Herodotus,<sup>[249](footnote/fn13.htm#P1332_368934.md)</sup> then, asserts
that Hercules, when driving the oxen of Geryon from
Erytheia,<sup>[250](footnote/fn13.htm#P1333_369038.md)</sup> came into
Scythia, and that, being wearied with travel-ling, he retired into some
desert spot and slept for a short time. But while he slumbered his horse
disappeared, seated on which he had performed his lengthened journey. On
being aroused from repose, he, however, instituted a diligent search
through the desert, endeavouring to discover his horse. And though he is
unsuccessful in his search after the horse, he yet finds in the desert a
certain damsel, half of whose form was that of woman, and proceeded to
question her if she had seen the horse anywhere. The girl, however,
replies that she had seen (the animal), but that she would not show him
unless Hercules previously would come along with her for the purpose of
sexual intercourse. Now Herodotus informs us that her upper parts as far
as the groin were those of a virgin, but that everything below the body
after the groin presented some horrible appearance of a snake. In
anxiety, however, for the discovery of his horse, Hercules complies with
the monster's request; for he knew her (carnally), and made her
pregnant. And he foretold, after coition, that she had by him in her
womb three children at the same time, who were destined to become
illustrious. And he ordered that she, on bringing forth, should impose
on the children as soon as born the following names: Agathyrsus,
Gelonus, and Scytha. And as the reward of this (favour) receiving his
horse from the beast-like damsel, he went on his way, taking with him
the cattle also. But after these (details), Herodotus has a protracted
account; adieu, however, to it for the
present.<sup>[251](footnote/fn13.htm#P1334_370800.md)</sup> But what the
opinions are of Justinus, who transfers this legend into (his account
of) the generation of the universe, we shall explain.

This (heresiarch) makes the following statement. There are three
unbegotten principles of the universe, two male (and) one female. Of the
male (principles), however, a certain one, is denominated good, and it
alone is called after this manner, and possesses a power of prescience
concerning the universe. But the other is
father<sup>[252](footnote/fn13.htm#P1338_371499.md)</sup> of all begotten
things, devoid of
prescience,<sup>[253](footnote/fn13.htm#P1339_371566.md)</sup> and
invisible. And the female (principle) is devoid of prescience,
passionate, two-minded,<sup>[254](footnote/fn13.htm#P1340_371831.md)</sup>
two-bodied, in every respect answering (the description of) the girl in
the legend of Herodotus, as far as the groin a virgin, and (in) the
parts below (resembling) a snake, as Justinus says. But this girl is
styled Edem and Israel. And these principles of the universe are, he
says, roots and fountains from which existing things have been produced,
but that there was not anything else. The Father, then, who is devoid of
prescience, beholding that half-woman Edem, passed into a concupiscent
desire for her. But this Father, he says, is called Elohim. Not less did
Edem also long for Elohim, and the mutual passion brought them together
into the one nuptial couch of
love.<sup>[255](footnote/fn13.htm#P1341_372569.md)</sup> And from such an
intercourse the Father generates out of Edem unto himself twelve angels.
And the names of the angels begotten by the Father are these: Michael,
Amen,<sup>[256](footnote/fn13.htm#P1342_372834.md)</sup> Baruch, Gabriel,
Esaddaeus.... And of the maternal angels which Edem brought forth, the
names in like manner have been subjoined, and they are as follows:
Babel,<sup>[257](footnote/fn13.htm#P1343_373036.md)</sup> Achamoth, Naas,
Bel, Belias, Satan, Saël, Adonaeus,
Leviathan,<sup>[258](footnote/fn13.htm#P1344_373147.md)</sup> Pharao,
Carcamenos, (and) Lathen.

Of these twenty-four angels the paternal ones are associated with the
Father, and do all things according to His will; and the maternal
(angels are associated with) Edem the Mother. And the multitude of all
these angels together is Paradise, he says, concerning which Moses
speaks: "God planted a garden in Eden towards the
east,"<sup>[259](footnote/fn13.htm#P1346_373535.md)</sup> that is, towards
the face of Edem, that Edem might behold the garden-that is, the
angels-continually. Allegorically the angels are styled trees of this
garden, and the tree of life is the third of the paternal angels-Baruch.
And the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is the third of the
maternal angels-Naas. For
so,<sup>[260](footnote/fn13.htm#P1347_373876)</sup> says (Justinus.md), one
ought to interpret the words of Moses, observing, "Moses said these
things disguisedly, from the fact that all do not attain the truth."
And, he says, Paradise being formed from the conjugal joy of Elohim and
Edem, the angels of Elohim receiving from the most beauteous earth, that
is, not from tile portion of Edem resembling a monster, but from the
parts above the groin of human shape, and gentle-in aspect,-make man out
of the earth. But out of the parts resembling a monster are produced
wild beasts, and the rest of the animal creation. They made man,
therefore, as a symbol of the unity and love (subsisting) between them;
and they depute their own powers unto him, Edem the soul, but Elohim the
spirit. And the man Adam is produced as some actual seal and memento of
love, and as an everlasting emblem of the marriage of Edem and Elohim.
And in like manner also Eve was produced, he says, as Moses has
described, an image and emblem (as well as) a seal, to be preserved for
ever, of Edem. And in like manner also a soul was deposited in Eve,-an
image-from Edem, but a spirit from Elohim. And there were given to them
commandments, "Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the
earth,"<sup>[261](footnote/fn13.htm#P1348_375113.md)</sup> that is, Edem;
for so he wishes that it had been written. For the entire of the power
belonging unto herself, Edem conferred upon Elohim as a sort of nuptial
dowry. Whence, he says, from imitation of that primary marriage up to
this day, women bring a dowry to their husbands, complying with a
certain divine and paternal law that came into existence on the part of
Edem towards Elohim.

And when all things were created as has been described by Moses-both
heaven and earth, and the things
therein<sup>[262](footnote/fn13.htm#P1350_375629.md)</sup> -the twelve
angels of the Mother were divided into four principles, and each fourth
part of them is called a river-Phison, and Gehon, and Tigris, and
Euphrates, as, he says, Moses states. These twelve angels, being
mutually connected, go about into four parts, and manage the world,
holding from Edem a sort of
viceregal<sup>[263](footnote/fn13.htm#P1351_376009.md)</sup> authority over
the world. But they do not always continue in the same places, but move
around as if in a circular dance, changing place after place, and at set
times and intervals retiring to the localities subject to themselves.
And when Phison holds sway over places, famine, distress, and affliction
prevail in that part of the earth, for the battalion of these angels is
niggardly. In like manner also there belong to each part of the four,
according to the power and nature of each, evil times and hosts of
diseases. And continually, according to the
dominion<sup>[264](footnote/fn13.htm#P1352_376644.md)</sup> of each fourth
part, this stream of evil, just (like a current) of rivers, careers,
according to the will of Edem, uninterruptedly around the world. And
from some cause of this description has arisen the necessity of evil.

When Elohim had prepared and created the world as a result from joint
pleasure, He wished to ascend up to the elevated parts of heaven, and to
see that not anything of what pertained to the creation laboured under
deficiency. And He took His Own angels with Him, for His nature was to
mount aloft, leaving Edem
below:<sup>[265](footnote/fn13.htm#P1354_377206.md)</sup> for inasmuch as
she was earth, she was not disposed to follow upward her spouse. Elohim,
then, coming to the highest part of heaven above, and beholding a light
superior to that which He Himself had created, exclaimed, "Open me the
gates, that entering in I may acknowledge the Lord; for I considered
Myself to be Lord."<sup>[266](footnote/fn13.htm#P1355_377626.md)</sup> A
voice was returned to Him from the light, saying, "This is the gate of
the Lord: through this the righteous enter
in."<sup>[267](footnote/fn13.htm#P1356_377769.md)</sup> And immediately the
gate was opened, and the Father, without the angels, entered,
(advancing) towards the Good One, and beheld "what eye hath not seen,
and ear hath not heard, and what hath not entered into the heart of man
to (conceive)."<sup>[268](footnote/fn13.htm#P1357_378032.md)</sup> Then the
Good One says to him, "Sit thou on my right
hand."<sup>[269](footnote/fn13.htm#P1358_378130.md)</sup> And the Father
says to the Good One, "Permit me, Lord, to overturn the world which I
have made, for my spirit is bound to
men.<sup>[270](footnote/fn13.htm#P1359_378275.md)</sup> And I wish to
receive it back (from them." Then the Good One replies to him, "No evil
canst thou do while thou art with me, for both thou and Edem made the
world as a result of conjugal joy. Permit Edem, then, to hold possession
of the world as long as she wishes; but do you remain with me." Then
Edem, knowing that she had been deserted by Elohim, was seized with
grief, and placed beside herself her own angels. And she adorned herself
after a comely fashion, if by any means Elohim, passing into
concupiscent desire, might descend (from heaven) to her.

When, however, Elohim, overpowered by the Good One, no longer descended
to Edem, Edem commanded Babel, which is Venus, to cause adulteries and
dissolutions of marriages among men. (And she adopted this expedient) in
order that, as she had been divorced from Elohim, so also the spirit of
Elohim, which is in men, being wrong with sorrow, might be punished by
such separations, and might undergo precisely the sufferings which (were
being endured by) the deserted Edem. And Edem gives great power to her
third angel, Naas, that by every species of punishment she might chasten
the spirit of Elohim which is in men, in order that Elohim, through the
spirit, might be punished for having deserted his spouse, in violation
of the agreements entered into between them. Elohim the father, seeing
these things, sends forth Baruch, the third angel among his own, to
succour the spirit that is in all
men.<sup>[271](footnote/fn13.htm#P1361_379755.md)</sup> Baruch then coming,
stood in the midst of the angels of Edem, that is, in the midst of
paradise-for paradise is the angels, in the midst of whom he stood,-and
issued to the man the following injunction: "Of every tree that is in
paradise thou mayest freely eat, but thou mayest not eat of the tree of
the knowledge of good and
evil,"<sup>[272](footnote/fn13.htm#P1362_380156.md)</sup> which is Naas.
Now the meaning is, that he should obey the rest of the eleven angels of
Edem, for the eleven possess passions, but are not guilty of
transgression. Naas, however, has committed sin, for he went in unto
Eve, deceiving her, and debauched her; and (such an act as) this is a
violation of law. He, however, likewise went in unto Adam, and had
unnatural intercourse with him; and this is itself also a piece of
turpitude, whence have arisen adultery and sodomy.

Henceforward vice and virtue were prevalent among men, arising from a
single source-that of the Father. For the Father having ascended to the
Good One, points out from time to time the way to those desirous of
ascending (to him likewise). After having, however, departed from Edem,
he caused an originating principle of evil for the spirit of the Father
that is in men.<sup>[273](footnote/fn13.htm#P1364_381023.md)</sup> Baruch
therefore was despatched to Moses, and through him spoke to the children
of Israel, that they might be converted unto the Good One. But the third
angel (Naas), by the soul which came from Edem upon Moses, as also upon
all men, obscured the precepts of Baruch, and caused his own peculiar
injunctions to be hearkened unto. For this reason the soul is arrayed
against the spirit, and the spirit against the
soul.<sup>[274](footnote/fn13.htm#P1365_381466.md)</sup> For the soul is
Edem, but the spirit Elohim, and each of these exists in all men, both
females and males. Again, after these (occurrences), Baruch was sent to
the Prophets, that through the Prophets the spirit that dwelleth in
men<sup>[275](footnote/fn13.htm#P1366_381716.md)</sup> might hear (words of
warning), and might avoid Edem and the wicked fiction, just as the
Father had fled from Elohim. In like manner also-by the
prophets<sup>[276](footnote/fn13.htm#P1367_381894.md)</sup> -Naas, by a
similar device, through the
soul<sup>[277](footnote/fn13.htm#P1368_382028.md)</sup> that dwells in man,
along with the spirit of the Father, enticed away the prophets, and all
(of them) were allured after him, and did not follow the words of
Baruch, which Elohim enjoined.

Ultimately Elohim selected Hercules, an uncircumcised prophet, and sent
him to quell the twelve angels of Edem, and release the Father from the
twelve angels, those wicked ones of the creation. These are the twelve
conflicts of Hercules which Hercules underwent, in order, from first to
last, viz., Lion, and Hydra, and Boar, and the others successively. For
they say that these are the names (of them) among the Gentiles, and they
have been derived with altered denominations from the energy of the
maternal angels. When he seemed to have vanquished his antagonists,
Omphale-now she is Babel or Venus-clings to him and entices away
Hercules, and divests him of his power, viz., the commands of Baruch
which Elohim issued. And in place (of this power, Babel) envelopes him
in her own peculiar robe, that is, in the power of Edem, who is the
power below; and in this way the prophecy of Hercules remained
unfulfilled, and his works.

Finally, however, in the days of Herod the king, Baruch is despatched,
being sent down once more by Elohim; and coming to Nazareth, he found
Jesus, son of Joseph and Mary, a child of twelve years, feeding sheep.
And he announces to him all things from the beginning, whatsoever had
been done by Edem and Elohim, and whatsoever would be likely to take
place hereafter, and spoke the following words: "All the prophets
anterior to you have been enticed. Put forth an effort, therefore,
Jesus, Son of man, not to be allured, but preach this word unto men, and
carry back tidings to them of things pertaining to the Father, and
things pertaining to the Good One, and ascend to the Good One, and sit
there with Elohim, Father of us all." And Jesus was obedient unto the
angel, saying that, "I shall do all things, Lord," and proceeded to
preach. Naas therefore wished to entice this one also. (Jesus, however,
was not disposed to listen to his
overtures<sup>[278](footnote/fn13.htm#P1371_384141)</sup> .md), for he
remained faithful to Baruch. Therefore Naas, being inflamed with anger
because he was not able to seduce him, caused him to be crucified. He,
however, leaving the body of Edem on the (accursed) tree, ascended to
the Good One; saying, however, to Edem, "Woman, thou retainest thy
son,"<sup>[279](footnote/fn13.htm#P1372_384520.md)</sup> that is, the
natural and the earthly man. But (Jesus) himself commending his spirit
into the hands of the Father, ascended to the Good One. Now the Good One
is Priapus, (and) he it is who antecedently caused the production of
everything that exists. On this account he is styled Priapus, because he
previously fashioned all things (according to his own design). For this
reason, he says, in every temple is placed his statue, which is revered
by every creature; and (there are images of him) in the highways,
carrying over his head ripened fruits, that is, the produce of the
creation, of which he is the cause, having in the first instance formed,
(according to His own design), the creation, when as yet it had no
existence. When, therefore, he says, you hear men asserting that the
swan went in unto Leda, and begat a child from her, (learn that) the
swan is Elohim, and Leda Edem. And when people allege that an eagle went
in unto Ganymede, (know that) the eagle is Naas, and Ganymede Adam. And
when they assert that gold (in a shower) went in unto Danae and begat a
child from her, (recollect that) the gold is Elohim, and Danae is Edem.
And similarly, in the same manner adducing all accounts of this
description, which correspond with (the nature of) legends, they pursue
the work of instruction. When, therefore, the prophet says, "Hearken, O
heaven, and give ear, O earth; the Lord hath spoken," he means by
heaven, (Justinus) says, the spirit which is in man from Elohim; and by
earth, the soul which is in man along with the spirit; and by Lord,
Baruch; and by Israel, Edem, for Israel as well as Edem is called the
spouse of Elohim. "Israel," he says, "did not know me (Elohim); for had
he known me, that I am with the Good One, he would not have punished
through paternal ignorance the spirit which is in men."

Hence<sup>[280](footnote/fn13.htm#P1376_386472.md)</sup> also, in the first
book inscribed "Baruch," has been written the oath which they compel
those to swear who are about to hear these mysteries, and be initiated
with the Good One.<sup>[281](footnote/fn13.htm#P1377_386907.md)</sup> And
this oath, (Justinus) says, our Father Elohim sware when He was beside
the Good One, and having sworn He did not repent (of the oath),
respecting which, he says, it has been written, "The Lord sware, and
will not repent."<sup>[282](footnote/fn13.htm#P1378_387219.md)</sup> Now
the oath is couched in
these<sup>[283](footnote/fn13.htm#P1379_387284.md)</sup> terms: "I swear by
that Good One who is above all, to guard these mysteries, and to divulge
them to no one, and not to relapse from the Good One to the creature."
And when he has sworn this oath, he goes on to the Good One, and beholds
"whatever things eye hath not seen, and ear hath not heard, and which
have not entered into the heart of man;
"<sup>[284](footnote/fn13.htm#P1380_387663.md)</sup> and he drinks from
life-giving water, which is to them, as they suppose, a
bath,<sup>[285](footnote/fn13.htm#P1381_387765.md)</sup> a fountain of
life-giving, bubbling
water.<sup>[286](footnote/fn13.htm#P1382_387888.md)</sup> For there has
been a separation made between water and water; and there is water, that
below the firmament of the wicked creation, in which earthly and animal
men are washed; and there is life-giving water, (that) above the
firmament,<sup>[287](footnote/fn13.htm#P1383_388143.md)</sup> of the Good
One, in which spiritual (and) living men are washed; and in this Elohim
washed Himself. and having washed did not repent. And when, he says, the
prophet affirms, "Take unto yourself a wife of whoredom, since the earth
has abandoned itself to fornication, (departing) from (following) after
the Lord; "<sup>[288](footnote/fn13.htm#P1384_388479.md)</sup> that is,
Edem (departs) from Elohim. (Now) in these words, he says, the prophet
clearly declares the entire mystery, and is not hearkened unto by reason
of the wicked machinations of Naas. According to that same manner, they
deliver other prophetical passages in a similar spirit of interpretation
throughout numerous books. The volume, however, inscribed "Baruch," is
pre-eminently to them the one in which the
reader<sup>[289](footnote/fn13.htm#P1385_388915.md)</sup> will ascertain
the entire explanation of their legendary system (to be contained).
Beloved, though I have encountered many heresies, yet with no wicked
(heresiarch) worse than this (Justinus) has it been my lot to meet. But,
in truth, (the followers of Justinus) ought to
imitate<sup>[290](footnote/fn13.htm#P1386_389287.md)</sup> the example of
his Hercules, and to cleanse, as the saying is, the cattle-shed of
Augias, or rather I should say, a
ditch,<sup>[291](footnote/fn13.htm#P1387_389482.md)</sup> into which, as
soon as the adherents of this (heresiarch) have fallen, they can never
be cleansed; nay, they will not be able even to raise their heads.

Since, then, we have explained the attempts (at a system) of the
pseudo-gnostic Justinus, it appears likewise expedient in the following
books to elucidate the opinions put forward in heresies following (in
the way of consequence upon the doctrines of Justinus), and to leave not
a single one of these (speculators) unrefuted. Our refutation will be
accomplished by adducing the assertions made by them; such (at least of
their statements) as are sufficient for making a public example (of
these heretics). (And we shall attain our purpose), even though there
should only be condemned<sup>[292](footnote/fn13.htm#P1391_390513.md)</sup>
the secret and ineffable (mysteries) practised amongst them, into which,
silly mortals that they are, scarcely (even) with considerable labour
are they initiated. Let us then see what also Simon affirms.
