##  Epistle L.<sup>[1](footnote/fn55.htm#P5549_1691767.md)</sup>

From Cyprian to the Confessors, Congratulating Them on Their Return from
Schism.

1\. Cyprian to Maximus the presbyter, also to Urbanus, and Sidonius, and
Maturest, his brethren, greeting. When I read your letters, dearest
brethren, that you wrote to me about your return, and about the peace of
the Church, and the brotherly restoration, I confess that I was as
greatly overjoyed as I had before been overjoyed when I learnt the glory
of your confession, and thankfully received tidings of the heavenly and
spiritual renown of your warfare. For this, moreover, is another
confession of your faith and praise; to confess that the Church is one,
and not to become a sharer in other men's error, or rather wickedness;
to seek anew the same camp whence you went forth, whence with the most
vigorous strength you leapt forth to wage the battle and to subdue the
adversary. For the trophies from the battle-field ought to be brought
back thither whence the arms for the field had been received, lest the
Church of Christ should not retain those same glorious warriors whom
Christ had furnished for glory. Now, however, you have kept in the peace
of the Lord the fitting tenor of your faith and the law of undivided
charity and concord, and have given by your walk an example of love and
peace to others; so that the truth of the Church, and the unity of the
Gospel mystery which is held by us, are also linked together by your
consent and bond; and confessors of Christ do not become the leaders of
error, after having stood forth as praiseworthy originators of virtue
and honour.

2\. Let others consider how much they may congratulate you, or how much
each one may glory for himself: I confess that I congratulate you more,
and I more boast of you to others, in respect of this your peaceful
return and charity. For you ought in simplicity to hear what was in my
heart. I grieved vehemently, and I was greatly afflicted, that I could
not hold communion with those whom once I had begun to love. After the
schismatical and heretical error laid hold of you, on your going forth
from prison, it seemed as if your glory had been left in the dungeon.
For there the dignity of your name seemed to have stayed behind when the
soldiers of Christ did not return from the prison to the Church,
although they had gone into the prison with the praise and
congratulations of the Church.

3\. For although there seem to be tares in the Church, yet neither our
faith nor our charity ought to be hindered, so that because we see that
there are tares in the Church we ourselves should withdraw from the
Church: we ought only to labour that we may be wheat, that when the
wheat shall begin to be gathered into the Lord's barns, we may receive
fruit for our labour and work. The apostle in his epistle says, "In a
great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver, but also of
wood and of earth, and some to honour and some to
dishonour."<sup>[2](footnote/fn55.htm#P5556_1694833.md)</sup> Let us
strive, dearest brethren, and labour as much as we possibly can, that we
may be vessels of gold or silver. But to the Lord alone it is granted to
break the vessels of earth, to whom also is given the rod of iron. The
servant cannot be greater than his lord, nor may any one claim to
himself what the Father has given to the Son alone, so as to think that
he can take the fan for winnowing and purging the threshing-floor, or
can separate by human judgment all the tares from the wheat. That is a
proud obstinacy and a sacrilegious presumption which a depraved madness
assumes to itself. And while some are always assuming to themselves more
dominion than meek justice demands, they perish from the Church; and
while they insolently extol themselves, blinded by their own swelling,
they lose the light of truth. For which reason we also, keeping
moderation, and considering the Lord's balances, and thinking of the
love and mercy of God the Father, have long and carefully pondered with
ourselves, and have weighed what was to be done with due moderation.

4\. All which matters you can look into thoroughly, if you will read the
tracts<sup>[3](footnote/fn55.htm#P5558_1695991.md)</sup> which I have
lately read here, and have, for the sake of our mutual love, transmitted
to you also for you to read; wherein there is neither wanting for the
lapsed, censure which may rebuke, nor medicine which may heal. Moreover,
my feeble ability has expressed as well as it could the unity of the
Catholic Church.<sup>[4](footnote/fn55.htm#P5559_1696345.md)</sup> Which
treatise I now more and more trust will be pleasing to you, since you
now read it in such a way as both to approve and love it; inasmuch as
what we have written in words you fulfil in deeds, when you return to
the Church in the unity of charity and peace. I bid you, dearest
brethren, and greatly longed-for, ever heartily farewell.
