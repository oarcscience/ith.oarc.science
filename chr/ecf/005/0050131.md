##  Elucidations.

I

Maintained by consent, and caressed by excuses, p. 557.

The severer discipline of early Christianity must not be discarded by
those who claim it for the canon of Scripture; for modes of baptism,
confirmation, and other rites; for Church polity, in short; and for the
Christian year. Let us note that the whole spirit of antiquity is
opposed to *worldliness*. It reflects the precept, "Be not conformed to
this world," and in nothing more emphatically than in hostility to
theatrical amusements, which in our days are re-asserting the deadly
influence over Christians which Cyprian and Tertullian and other Fathers
so solemnly denounced. If they were "maintained by consent, and caressed
by excuses," even in the martyr-age, no wonder that in our Laodicean
period they baffle all exertions of faithful watchmen, who enforce the
baptismal vow against "*pomps* and vanities," always understood of
theatrical shows, and hence part of that "world, the flesh, and the
devil" which Christians have renounced.

Now is the axe laid to the root, p. 586.

Matthew 3:10. "Securis ad radicem arboris *posita est*, " says Cyprian,
quoting the Old Latin, with which the Vulgate substantially
agrees.<sup>[58](footnote/fn99.htm#P9912_3088259.md)</sup> A very diligent
biblical scholar directs attention to the vulgar abuse of this
saying,<sup>[59](footnote/fn99.htm#P9913_3088401.md)</sup> which turns upon
a confusion of the active verb to lay, with the neuter verb *to
lie*.<sup>[60](footnote/fn99.htm#P9914_3088549.md)</sup> It is quoted as if
it read, *Lay the axe to the root*, and is "interpreted, popularly, as
of felling a tree, an incumbrance or a nuisance.... Hence it often makes
radical reformers in Church and State, and becomes the motto of many a
reckless leader whose way has been to teach, not upward by elevating the
ignoble, but downward by sinking the elevated.... There is something
similar in Latin: *jacio* to hurl; and *jacea*, to lie, recline, or
remain at rest. Beza follows the Vulgate (*posita est*); but the
original is
clear,-kei=tai,<sup>[61](footnote/fn99.htm#P9915_3089146.md)</sup> *is
laid, or lieth*.... It means, The axe is ready; it lieth near the root,
in mercy and in menace ... *The long-suffering of God waiteth as in the
days of Noah* ... waiteth, i.e., for good fruit."

Compare Luke 13:9: "If it bear fruit, well: and if not, then after that
thou shalt cut it down." Such is the argument of Cyprian, in view of the
approaching "end of time."

III

General Note.

Let me here call attention to the mischievous use of words common among
modern Latins, even the best of them. Thus,
Pellicia<sup>[62](footnote/fn99.htm#P9921_3089687.md)</sup> mentions
Cyprian as referring his synodical judgment to "*the supreme chair* of
the Church of Rome." No need to say that his reference proves nothing of
the kind. "Supremacy," indeed! Consult Bossuet and the Gallicans on that
point, even after Trent. The case cited is evidence of the very reverse.
Cyprian and his Carthaginian colleagues wished, also, the conspicuous
co-operation of their Italian brethren; and so he writes to "Cornelius,
*our colleague*," who, "with very many comprovincial bishops, having
held a council, concurred in the same opinion." It is an instance of
*fraternal concurrence* on grounds of entire equality; and Cyprian's
courteous invitation to his "colleague" Cornelius and his comprovincials
to co-operate, is a striking illustration of the maxim, "*Totus*
apellandus sit *orbis*, ubi totum orbem causa spectat." Compare St.
Basil's letters to the Western bishops, in which he reminds them that
the Gospel came to them from the East. This is a sort of *primacy*
recognised by St. Paul
himself,<sup>[63](footnote/fn99.htm#P9922_3091011.md)</sup> as it was
afterwards, when Jerusalem was recognised as "the mother of all the
churches"<sup>[64](footnote/fn99.htm#P9923_3091120.md)</sup> by a general
council, writing to Damasus, bishop of Rome, himself.
