##  Epistle LVII.<sup>[1](footnote/fn58.htm#P5855_1834563.md)</sup>

To Lucius<sup>[2](footnote/fn58.htm#P5857_1834607.md)</sup> The Bishop of
Rome, Returned from Banishment.

1\. Cyprian, with his colleagues, to Lucius his brother, greeting. We
had lately also congratulated you indeed, dearest brother, when the
divine condescension, by a double honour, appointed you in the
administration of God's Church, as well a confessor as a priest. But now
also we no less congratulate you and your companions, and the whole
fraternity, that the benignant and liberal protection of the Lord has
brought you back again to His own with the same glory, and with praises
to you; that so the shepherd might be restored to feed his flock, and
the pilot to manage the ship, and the ruler to govern the people; and
that it might appear that your banishment was so divinely arranged, not
that the bishop banished and driven away should be wanting to the
Church, but that he should return to the Church greater than he had left
it.

2\. For the dignity of martyrdom was not the less in the case of the
three youths, because, their death being frustrated, they came forth
safe from the fiery furnace; nor did Daniel stand forth uncompleted in
the praise he deserved, because, when he had been sent to the lions for
a prey, he was protected by the Lord, and lived to glory. Among
confessors of Christ, martyrdoms deferred do not diminish the merits of
confession, but show forth the greatness of divine protection. We see
represented in you what the brave and illustrious youths announced
before the king, that they indeed were prepared to be burnt in the
flames, that they might not serve his gods, nor worship the image which
he had made; but that the God whom they worshipped, and whom we also
worship, was able even to rescue them from the fiery furnace, and to
deliver them from the hands of the king, and from imminent sufferings.
This we now find carried out in the faith of your confession, and in the
Lord's protection over you; so that while you were prepared and ready to
undergo all punishment, yet the Lord withdrew you from punishment, and
preserved you for the Church. In your return the dignity of his
confession has not been abridged in the bishop, but the priestly
authority has rather increased; so that a priest is assisting at the
altar of God, who exhorts the people to take up the arms of confession,
and to submit to martyrdom, that Antichrist is near, prepares the
soldiers for the battle, not only by the urgency of his speech and his
words, but by the example of his faith and courage.

3\. We understand, dearest brother, and we perceive with the whole light
of our heart, the salutary and holy plans of the divine majesty, whence
the sudden persecution lately arose there-whence the secular power
suddenly broke forth against the Church of Christ and the bishop
Cornelius, the blessed martyr, and all of you; so that, for the
confusion and beating down of heretics, the Lord might
show<sup>[3](footnote/fn58.htm#P5863_1838036.md)</sup> which was the
Church-which is its one bishop chosen by divine appointment-which
presbyters are associated with the bishop in priestly honour-which is
the united and true people of Christ, linked together in the love of the
Lord's flock-who they were whom the enemy would harass; whom, on the
other hand, the devil would spare as being his own. For Christ's
adversary does not persecute and attack any except Christ's camp and
soldiers; heretics, once prostrated and made his own, he despises and
passes by. He seeks to cast down those whom he sees to stand.

4\. And I wish, dearest brother, that the power were now given us to be
with you there on your return, that we ourselves, who love you with
mutual love, might, being present with the rest, also receive the very
joyous fruit of your coming. What exultation among all the brethren
there; what running together and embracing of each one as they arrive!
Scarcely can you be satisfied with the kisses of those who cling to you;
scarcely can the very faces and eyes of the people be satiated with
seeing. At the joy of your coming the brotherhood there has begun to
recognise what and how great a joy will follow when Christ shall come.
For because His advent will quickly approach, a kind of representation
has now gone before in you; that just as John, His forerunner and
preparer of His way, came and preached that Christ had come, so, now
that a bishop returns as a confessor of the Lord, and His priest, it
appears that the Lord also is now returning. But I and my colleagues,
and all the brotherhood, send this letter to you in the stead of us,
dearest brother; and setting forth to you by our letter our joy, we
express the faithful inclination of our love here also in our sacrifices
and our prayers, not ceasing to give thanks to God the Father, and to
Christ His Son our Lord; and as well to pray as to entreat, that He who
is perfect, and makes perfect, will keep and perfect in you the glorious
crown of your confession, who perchance has called you back for this
purpose, that your glory should not be hidden, if the martyrdom of your
confession should be consummated away from home. For the victim which
affords an example to the brotherhood both of courage and of faith,
ought to be offered up when the brethren are present. We bid you,
dearest brother, ever heartily farewell.
