##  Epistle LXXVIII.<sup>[1](footnote/fn65.htm#P6577_2130013.md)</sup>

The Reply to the Same of Lucius and the Rest of the Martyrs.

1\. To Cyprian our brother and colleague, Lucius, and all the brethren
who are with me in the Lord, greeting. Your letter came to us, dearest
brother, while we were exulting and rejoicing in God that He had armed
us for the struggle, and had made us by His condescension conquerors in
the battle; the letter, namely, which you sent to us by Herennianus the
sub-deacon, and Lucian, and Maximus, and Amantius the
acolytes,<sup>[2](footnote/fn65.htm#P6582_2130735.md)</sup> which when we
read we received a relaxation in our bonds, a solace in our affliction,
and a support in our necessity; and we were aroused and more strenuously
animated to bear whatever more of punishment might be awaiting us. For
before our suffering we were called forth by you to glory, who first
afforded us guidance to confession of the name of Christ. We indeed, who
follow the footsteps of your confession, hope for an equal grace with
you. For he who is first in the race is first also for the reward; and
you who first occupied the course thence have communicated this to us
from what you began, showing doubtless the undivided love wherewith you
have always loved us, so that we who had one Spirit in the bond of peace
might have the grace of
your<sup>[3](footnote/fn65.htm#P6583_2131677.md)</sup> prayers, and one
crown of confession.

2\. But in your case, dearest brother, to the crown of confession is
added the reward of your labours-an abundant measure which you shall
receive from the Lord in the day of retribution, who have by your letter
presented yourself to us, as you manifested to us that candid and
blessed breast of yours which we have ever known, and in accordance with
its largeness have uttered praises to God with us, not as much as we
deserve to hear, but as much as you are able to utter. For with your
words you have both adorned those things which had been less in-strutted
in us, and have strengthened us to the sustaining of those sufferings
which we bear,<sup>[4](footnote/fn65.htm#P6585_2132376.md)</sup> as being
certain of the heavenly rewards, and of the crown of martyrdom, and of
the kingdom of God, from the prophecy which, being filled with the Holy
Spirit, you have pledged to us in your letter. All this will happen,
beloved, if you will have us in mind in your prayers, which I trust you
do even as we certainly do.

3\. And thus, O brother most longed-for, we have received what you sent
to us from Quirinus and from yourself, a sacrifice from every clean
thing. Even as Noah offered to God, and God was pleased with the sweet
savour, and had respect unto his offering, so also may He have respect
unto yours, and may He be pleased to return to you the reward of this so
good work. But I beg that you will command the letter which we have
written to Quirinus to be sent forward. I bid you, dearest brother and
earnestly desired, ever heartily farewell, and remember
us.<sup>[5](footnote/fn65.htm#P6587_2133274.md)</sup> Greet all who are
with you. Farewell.
