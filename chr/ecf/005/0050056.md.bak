##  Epistle XXXI.<sup>[1](footnote/fn52.htm#P5278_1610965.md)</sup>

To the Carthaginian Clergy, About the Letters Sent to Rome, and Received
Thence.

Cyprian to the presbyters and deacons, his brethren, greeting. That you,
my beloved brethren, might know what letters I have sent to the clergy
acting<sup>[2](footnote/fn52.htm#P5283_1611368.md)</sup> at Rome, and what
they have replied to me, and, moreover, what Moyses and Maximus, the
presbyters, and Rufinus and Nicostratus, the deacons, and the rest of
the confessors that with them are kept in prison, replied likewise to my
letters, I have sent you copies to read. Do you take care, with as much
diligence as you can, that what I have written, and what they have
replied, be made known to our brethren. And, moreover, if any bishops
from foreign places,<sup>[3](footnote/fn52.htm#P5284_1611874.md)</sup> my
colleagues, or presbyters, or deacons, should be present, or should
arrive among you, let them hear all these matters from you; and if they
wish to transcribe copies of the letters and to take them to their own
people, let them have the opportunity of transcribing them; although I
have, moreover, bidden Saturus the reader, our brother, to give liberty
of copying them to any individuals who wish it; so that, in ordering,
for the present, the condition of the Church in any manner, an
agreement, one and faithful, may be observed by all. But about the other
matters which were to be dealt with, as I have also written to several
of my colleagues, we will more fully consider them in a common council,
when, by the Lord's permission, we shall begin to assemble into one
place. I bid you, brethren, beloved and longed-for, ever heartily
farewell. Salute the brotherhood. Fare ye well.
