##  Epistle LXIV.<sup>[1](footnote/fn60.htm#P6047_1906705.md)</sup>

To Rogatianus, Concerning the Deacon Who Contended Against the Bishop.

1\. Cyprian to his brother Rogatianus, greeting. I and my colleagues who
were present with me were deeply and grievously distressed, dearest
brother, on reading your letter in which you complained of your deacon,
that, forgetful of your priestly station, and unmindful of his own
office and ministry, he had provoked you by his insults and injuries.
And you indeed have acted worthily, and with your accustomed humility
towards us, in rather complaining of him to us; although you have power,
according to the vigour of the episcopate and the authority of your See,
whereby you might be justified on him at once, assured that all we your
colleagues would regard it as a matter of satisfaction, whatever you
should do by your priestly power in respect of an insolent deacon, as
you have in respect of men of this kind divine commands. Inasmuch as the
Lord God says in Deuteronomy, "And the man that will do presumptuously,
and will not hearken unto the priest or the judge, whoever he shall be
in those days, that man shall die; and all the people, when they hear,
shall fear, and shall no more do
impiously."<sup>[3](footnote/fn60.htm#P6053_1908396.md)</sup> And that we
may know that this voice of God came forth with His true and highest
majesty to honour and avenge His priests; when three of the
ministers<sup>[4](footnote/fn60.htm#P6054_1908571.md)</sup> -Korah, Dathan,
and Abiram-dared to deal proudly, and to exalt their neck against Aaron
the priest, and to equal themselves with the priest set over them; they
were swallowed up and devoured by the opening of the earth, and so
immediately suffered the penalty of their sacrilegious audacity. Nor
they alone, but also two hundred and fifty others, who were their
companions in boldness, were consumed by a fire breaking forth from the
Lord, that it might be proved that God's priests are avenged by Him who
makes priests. In the book of Kings also, when Samuel the priest was
despised by the Jewish people on account of his age, as you are now, the
Lord in wrath exclaimed, and said, "They have not rejected thee, but
they have rejected me."<sup>[5](footnote/fn60.htm#P6055_1909467.md)</sup>
And that He might avenge this, He set over them Saul as a king, who
afflicted them with grievous injuries, and trod on the people, and
pressed down their pride with all insults and penalties, that the
despised priest might he avenged by divine vengeance on a proud people.

2\. Moreover also Solomon, established in the Holy Spirit, testifies and
teaches what is the priestly authority and power, saying, "Fear the Lord
with all thy soul, and reverence His priests;
"<sup>[6](footnote/fn60.htm#P6057_1909950.md)</sup> and again, "Honour God
with all thy soul, and honour His
priests."<sup>[7](footnote/fn60.htm#P6058_1910037.md)</sup> Mindful of
which precepts, the blessed Apostle Paul, according to what we read in
the Acts of the Apostles, when it was said to him, "Revilest thou thus
God's high priest? "answered and said, "I wist not, brethren, that he
was the high priest; for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of the
ruler of thy people."<sup>[8](footnote/fn60.htm#P6059_1910375.md)</sup>
Moreover, our Lord Jesus Christ Himself, our King, and Judge, and God,
even to the very day, of His passion observed the honour to priests and
high priests, although they observed neither the fear of God nor the
acknowledgment of Christ. For when He had cleansed the leper, He said to
him, "Go, show thyself to the priest, and offer the
gift."<sup>[9](footnote/fn60.htm#P6060_1910740.md)</sup> With that humility
which taught us also to he humble, He still called him a priest whom He
knew to be sacrilegious; also under the very sting of His passion, when
He had received a blow, and it was said to Him, "Answerest thou the high
priest so? "He said nothing reproachfully against the person of the high
priest, but rather maintained His own innocence saying, "If I have
spoken evil, bear witness of the evil; but if well, why smitest thou me?
"<sup>[10](footnote/fn60.htm#P6061_1911209.md)</sup> All which things were
therefore done by Him humbly and patiently, that we might have an
example of humility and patience; for He taught that true priests were
lawfully and fully to be honoured, in showing Himself such as He was in
respect of false priests.

3\. But deacons ought to remember that the Lord chose apostles, that is,
bishops and overseers; while apostles appointed for themselves
deacons<sup>[11](footnote/fn60.htm#P6063_1911629.md)</sup> after the ascent
of the Lord into heaven, as ministers of their episcopacy and of the
Church. But if we may dare anything against God who makes bishops,
deacons may also dare against us by whom they are made; and therefore it
behoves the deacon of whom you write to repent of his audacity, and to
acknowledge the honour of the priest, and to satisfy the bishop set over
him with full humility. For these things are the beginnings of heretics,
and the origins and endeavours of evil-minded schismatics;-to please
themselves, and with swelling haughtiness to despise him who is set over
them. Thus they depart from the Church-thus a profane altar is set up
outside-thus they rebel against the peace of Christ, and the appointment
and the unity of God. But if, further, he shall harass and provoke you
with his insults, you must exercise against him the power of your
dignity, by either deposing him or excommunicating him. For if the
Apostle Paul, writing to Timothy, said, "Let no man despise thy
youth,"<sup>[12](footnote/fn60.htm#P6064_1912670.md)</sup> how much rather
must it he said by your colleagues to you, "Let no man despise thy age?
And since you have written, that one has associated himself with that
same deacon of yours, and is a partaker of his pride and boldness, you
may either restrain or excommunicate him also, and any others that may
appear of a like disposition, and act against God's priest. Unless, as
we exhort anti advise, they should rather perceive that they have sinned
and make satisfaction, and suffer us to keep our own purpose; for we
rather ask and desire to overcome the reproaches and injuries of
individuals by clemency and patience, than to punish them by our
priestly power.<sup>[13](footnote/fn60.htm#P6065_1913349.md)</sup> I bid
you, dearest brother, ever heartily farewell.
