##  Epistle XIX.<sup>[1](footnote/fn50.htm#P5060_1534759.md)</sup>

Cyprian Replies to Caldonius.

Cyprian to Caldonius, his brother, greeting. We have received your
letter, beloved brother, which is abundantly sensible, and full of
honesty and faith. Nor do we wonder that, skilled and exercised as you
are in the Scriptures of the Lord, you do everything discreetly and
wisely. You have judged quite correctly about granting peace to our
brethren, which they, by true penitence and by the glory of a confession
of the Lord, have restored to themselves, being justified by their
words, by which before they had condemned themselves. Since, then, they
have washed away all their sin, and their former stain, by the help of
the Lord, has been done away by a more powerful virtue, they ought not
to lie any longer under the power of the devil, as it were, prostrate;
when, being banished and deprived of all their property, they have
lifted themselves up and have begun to stand with Christ. And I wish
that the others also would repent after their fall, and be transferred
into their former condition; and that you may know how we have dealt
with these, in their urgent and eager rashness and importunity to extort
peace, I have sent a book<sup>[2](footnote/fn50.htm#P5065_1536246.md)</sup>
to you, with letters to the number of five, that I wrote to the clergy
and to the people, and to the martyrs also and confessors, which letters
have already been sent to many of our colleagues, and have satisfied
them; and they replied that they also agree with me in the same opinion
according to the Catholic faith; which very thing do you also
communicate to as many of our colleagues as you can, that among all
these, may be observed one mode of action and one agreement, according
to the Lord's precepts.<sup>[3](footnote/fn50.htm#P5066_1536797.md)</sup> I
bid you, beloved brother, ever heartily farewell.
