##  Epistle XL.<sup>[1](footnote/fn54.htm#P5411_1652145.md)</sup>

To Cornelius, on His Refusal to Receive Novatian's
Ordination.<sup>[2](footnote/fn54.htm#P5413_1652242.md)</sup>

1\. Cyprian to Cornelius, his brother, greeting. There have come to us,
beloved brother, sent by Novatian, Maximus the presbyter, and Augendus
the deacon, and a certain Machaeus and Longinus. But, as we discovered,
as well from the letters which they brought with them, as from their
discourse and declaration, that Novatian had been made bishop; disturbed
by the wickedness of an unlawful ordination made in opposition to the
Catholic Church, we considered at once that they must be restrained from
communion with us; and having, in the meanwhile, refuted and repelled
the things which they pertinaciously and obstinately endeavoured to
assert, I and several of my colleagues, who had come together to me,
were awaiting the arrival of our colleagues Caldonius and Fortunatus,
whom we had lately sent to you as ambassadors, and to our
fellow-bishops, who were present at your
ordination,<sup>[3](footnote/fn54.htm#P5417_1653375.md)</sup> in order
that, when they came and reported the truth of the matter, the
wickedness of the adverse party might be quelled through them, by
greater authority and manifest proof. But there came, in addition,
Pompeius and Stephanus, our colleagues, who themselves also, by way of
instructing us thereon, put forward manifest proofs and testimonies in
conformity with their gravity and faithfulness, so that it was not even
necessary that those who had come, as sent by Novatian, should be heard
any further. And when in our solemn
assembly<sup>[4](footnote/fn54.htm#P5418_1654047.md)</sup> they burst in
with invidious abuse and turbulent clamour, demanding that the
accusations, which they said that they brought and would prove, should
be publicly investigated by us and by the people, we said that it was
not consistent with our gravity to suffer the honour of our colleague,
who had already been chosen and ordained and approved by the laudable
sentence of many, to be called into question any further by the abusive
voice of rivals. And because it would be a long business to collect into
a letter the matters in which they have been refuted and repressed, and
in which they have been manifested as having caused heresy by their
unlawful attempts, you shall hear everything most fully from Primitivus
our co-presbyter,<sup>[5](footnote/fn54.htm#P5419_1654907.md)</sup> when he
shall come to you.

2\. And lest their raging boldness should ever cease, they are striving
here also to distract the members of Christ into schismatical parties,
and to cut and tear the one body of the Catholic Church, so that,
running about from door to door, through the houses of many, or from
city to city, through certain districts, they seek for companions in
their obstinacy and error to join to themselves in their schism. To whom
we have once given this reply, nor shall we cease to command them to lay
aside their pernicious dissensions and disputes, and to be aware that it
is an impiety to forsake their Mother; and to acknowledge and understand
that when a bishop<sup>[6](footnote/fn54.htm#P5421_1655672.md)</sup> is
once made and approved by the testimony and judgment of his colleagues
and the people, another can by no means be
appointed.<sup>[7](footnote/fn54.htm#P5422_1655919.md)</sup> Thus, if they
consult their own interest peaceably and faithfully, if they confess
themselves to be maintainers of the Gospel of Christ, they must return
to the Church. I bid you, dearest brother, ever heartily farewell.
