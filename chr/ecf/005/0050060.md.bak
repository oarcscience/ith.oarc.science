##  Epistle XXXV.<sup>[1](footnote/fn53.htm#P5333_1627352.md)</sup>

To the Clergy, Concerning the Care of the Poor and Strangers.

Cyprian to the presbyters and deacons, his beloved brethren, greeting.
In safety, by God's grace, I greet you, beloved brethren, desiring soon
to come to you, and to satisfy the wish as well of myself and you, as of
all the brethren. It behoves me also, however, to have regard to the
common peace, and, in the meantime, although with weariness of spirit,
to be absent from you, lest my presence should provoke the jealousy and
violence of the heathens, and I should be the cause of breaking the
peace, who ought rather to be careful for the quiet of all. When,
therefore, you write that matters are arranged, and that I ought to
come, or if the Lord should condescend to intimate it to me before, then
I will come to you. For where could I be better or more joyful than
there where the Lord willed me both to believe and to grow up? I request
that you will diligently take care of the widows, and of the sick, and
of all the poor. Moreover, you may supply the expenses for strangers, if
any should be indigent, from my own portion, which I have left with
Rogatianus, our
fellow-presbyter;<sup>[2](footnote/fn53.htm#P5338_1628636.md)</sup> which
portion, lest it should be all appropriated, I have supplemented by
sending to the same by Naricus the acolyte another share, so that the
sufferers may be more largely and promptly dealt with. I bid you,
beloved brethren, ever heartily farewell; and have me in remembrance.
Greet your brotherhood in my name, and tell them to be mindful of me.
