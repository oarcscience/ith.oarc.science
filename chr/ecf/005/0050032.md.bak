##  Epistle VII.<sup>[1](footnote/fn48.htm#P4858_1470080.md)</sup>

To the Clergy, Concerning Prayer to God.

1\. Cyprian to the presbyters and deacons, his brethren, greeting.
Although I know, brethren beloved, that from the fear which we all of us
owe to God, you also are instantly urgent in continual petitions anti
earnest prayers to Him, still I myself remind your religious anxiety,
that in order to appease and entreat the Lord, we must lament not only
in words, but also with fastings and with tears, and with every kind of
urgency. For we must perceive and confess that the so disordered ruin
arising from that affliction, which has in a great measure laid waste,
and is even still laying waste, our flock, has visited us according to
our sins, in that we do not keep the way of the Lord, nor observe the
heavenly commandments given to us for our salvation. Our Lord did the
will of His Father, and we do not do the will of our Lord; eager about
our patrimony and our gain, seeking to satisfy our pride, yielding
ourselves wholly to emulation and to strife, careless of simplicity and
faith, renouncing the world in words only, and not in deeds, every one
of us pleasing himself, and displeasing all
others,<sup>[2](footnote/fn48.htm#P4863_1471405.md)</sup> -therefore we are
smitten as we deserve, since it is written: "And that servant, which
knoweth his master's will, and has not obeyed his will, shall be beaten
with many stripes."<sup>[3](footnote/fn48.htm#P4864_1471750.md)</sup> But
what stripes, what blows, do we not deserve, when even confessors, who
ought to be an example of virtuous life to others, do not maintain
discipline? Therefore, while an inflated and immodest boastfulness about
their own confession excessively elates some, tortures come upon them,
and tortures without any cessation of the tormentor, without any end of
condemnation, without any comfort of death,-tortures which do not easily
let them pass to the crown, but wrench them on the rack until they cause
them to abandon their faith, unless some one taken away by the divine
compassion should depart in the very midst of the torments, gaining
glory not by the cessation of his torture, but by the quickness of his
death:

2\. These things we suffer by our own fault and our own deserving, even
as the divine judgment has forewarned us, saying, "If they forsake my
law and walk not in my judgments, if they profane my statutes and keep
not my commandments, then will I visit their transgressions with the
rod, and their iniquities with
stripes."<sup>[4](footnote/fn48.htm#P4866_1472809.md)</sup> It is for this
reason that we feel the rods and the stripes, because we neither please
God with good deeds nor
atone<sup>[5](footnote/fn48.htm#P4867_1472948.md)</sup> for our sins. Let
us of our inmost heart and of our entire mind ask for God's mercy,
because He Himself also adds, saying, "Nevertheless my loving-kindness
will I not scatter away from
them."<sup>[6](footnote/fn48.htm#P4868_1473157.md)</sup> Let us ask, and we
shall receive; and if there be delay and tardiness in our receiving,
since we have grievously offended, let us knock, because "to him that
knocketh also it shall be
opened,"<sup>[7](footnote/fn48.htm#P4869_1473369.md)</sup> if only our
prayers, our groanings, and our tears, knock at the door; and with these
we must be urgent and persevering, even although prayer be offered with
one mind.<sup>[8](footnote/fn48.htm#P4870_1473552.md)</sup>

3\. For,-which the more induced and constrained me to write this letter
to you,-you ought to know (since the Lord has condescended to show and
to reveal it) that it was said in a vision, "Ask, and ye shall obtain."
Then, afterwards, that the attending people were bidden to pray for
certain persons pointed out to them, but that in their petitions there
were dissonant voices, and wills disagreeing, and that this excessively
displeased Him who had said, "Ask, and ye shall obtain," because the
disagreement of the people was out of harmony, and there was not a
consent of the brethren one and simple, and a united concord; since it
is written, "God who maketh men to be of one mind in a house;
"<sup>[9](footnote/fn48.htm#P4872_1474360.md)</sup> and we read in the Acts
of the Apostles, "And the multitude of them that believed were of one
heart and of one soul."<sup>[10](footnote/fn48.htm#P4873_1474536.md)</sup>
And the Lord has bidden us with His own voice, saying, "This is my
command, that ye love one
another."<sup>[11](footnote/fn48.htm#P4874_1474657.md)</sup> And again, "I
say unto you, that if two of you shall agree on earth as touching
anything that you shall ask, it shall be done for you of my Father which
is in heaven."<sup>[12](footnote/fn48.htm#P4875_1474843.md)</sup> But if
two of one mind can do so much, what might be effected if the unanimity
prevailed among all? But if, according to the peace which our Lord gave
us, there were agreement among all brethren, we should before this have
obtained from the divine mercy what we seek; nor should we be wavering
so long in this peril of our salvation and our faith. Yes, truly, and
these evils would not have come upon the brethren, if the brotherhood
had been animated with one spirit.

4\. For there also was shown that there sate the father of a family, a
young man also being seated at his right hand, who, anxious and somewhat
sad with a kind of indignation, holding his chin in his right hand,
occupied his place with a sorrowful look. But another standing on the
left hand, bore a net, which he threatened to throw, in order to catch
the people standing
round.<sup>[13](footnote/fn48.htm#P4877_1475712.md)</sup> And when he who
saw marvelled what this could be, it was told him that the youth who was
thus sitting on the right hand was saddened and grieved because his
commandments were not observed; but that he on the left was exultant
because an opportunity was afforded him of receiving from the father of
the family the power of destroying. This was shown long before the
tempest of this devastation arose. And we have seen that which had been
shown fulfilled; that while we despise the commandments of the Lord,
while we do not keep the salutary ordinances of the law that He has
given, the enemy was receiving a power of doing mischief, and was
overwhelming, by the cast of his net, those who were imperfectly armed
and too careless to resist.

5\. Let us urgently pray and groan with continual petitions. For know,
beloved brethren, that I was not long ago reproached with this also in a
vision, that we were sleepy in our prayers, and did not pray with
watchfulness; and undoubtedly God, who "rebukes whom He
loves,<sup>[14](footnote/fn48.htm#P4879_1476780.md)</sup> when He rebukes,
rebukes that He may amend, amends that He may preserve. Let us therefore
strike off and break away from the bonds of sleep, and pray with urgency
and watchfulness, as the Apostle Paul bids us, saying, "Continue in
prayer, and watch in the
same."<sup>[15](footnote/fn48.htm#P4880_1477061.md)</sup> For the apostles
also ceased not to pray day and night; and the Lord also Himself, the
teacher of our discipline, and the way of our example, frequently and
watch-fully prayed, as we read in the Gospel: "He went out into a
mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to
God."<sup>[16](footnote/fn48.htm#P4881_1477362.md)</sup> And assuredly what
He prayed for, He prayed for on our behalf, since He was not a sinner,
but bore the sins of others. But He so prayed for us, that in another
place we read, "And the Lord said to Peter, Behold, Satan has desired to
sift you as wheat: but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail
not."<sup>[17](footnote/fn48.htm#P4882_1477686.md)</sup> But if for us and
for our sins He both laboured and watched and prayed, how much more
ought we to be instant in prayers; and, first of all, to pray and to
entreat the Lord Himself, and then through Him, to make satisfaction to
God the Father! We have an advocate and an intercessor for our sins,
Jesus Christ the Lord and our God, if only we repent of our sins past,
and confess and acknowledge our sins, whereby we now offend the Lord,
and for the time to come engage to walk in His ways, and to fear His
commandments. The Father corrects and protects us, if we still stand
fast in the faith both in afflictions and perplexities, that is to say,
cling closely to His Christ; as it is written, "Who shall separate us
from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution,
or famine or nakedness, or peril, or
sword?<sup>[18](footnote/fn48.htm#P4883_1478545.md)</sup> None of these
things can separate believers, nothing can tear away those who are
clinging to His body and blood. Persecution of that kind is an
examination and searching out of the heart. God wills us to be sifted
and proved, as He has always proved His people; and yet in His trials
help has never at any time been wanting to believers.

6\. Finally, to the very least of His servants although placed among
very many sins, and unworthy of His condescension, yet He has
condescended of His goodness towards us to
command:<sup>[19](footnote/fn48.htm#P4885_1479084.md)</sup> "Tell him,"
said He, "to be safe, because peace is coming; but that, in the
meantime, there is a little delay, that some who still remain may be
proved." But we are admonished by these divine condescensions both
concerning a spare diet and a temperate use of drink; to wit, lest
worldly enticement should enervate the breast now elevated with
celestial vigour, or lest the mind, weighed down by too abundant
feasting, should be less watchful unto prayers and supplication.

7\. It was my duty not to conceal these special matters, nor to hide
them alone in my own consciousness,-matters by which each one of us may
be both instructed and guided. And do not you for your part keep this
letter concealed among yourselves, but let the brethren have it to mad.
For it is the part of one who desires that his brother should not be
warned and instructed, to intercept those words with which the Lord
condescends to admonish and instruct us. Let them know that we are
proved by our Lord, and let them never fail of that faith whereby we
have once believed in Him, under the conflict of this present
affliction. Let each one, acknowledging his own sins, even now put off
the conversation of the old man. "For no man who looks back as he
putteth his hand to the plough is fit for the kingdom of
God."<sup>[20](footnote/fn48.htm#P4887_1480686.md)</sup> And, finally,
Lot's wife, who, when she was delivered, looked back in defiance of the
commandment, lost the benefit of her
escape.<sup>[21](footnote/fn48.htm#P4888_1480835.md)</sup> Let us look not
to things which are behind, whither the devil calls us back, but to
things which are before, whither Christ calls us. Let us lift up our
eyes to heaven, lest the earth with its delights and enticements deceive
us. Let each one of us pray God not for himself only, but for all the
brethren, even as the Lord has taught us to pray, when He bids to each
one, not private prayer, but enjoined them, when they prayed, to pray
for all in common prayer and concordant
supplication.<sup>[22](footnote/fn48.htm#P4889_1481345.md)</sup> If the
Lord shall behold us humble and peaceable; if He shall see us joined one
with another; if He shall see us fearful concerning His anger; if
corrected and amended by the present tribulation, He will maintain us
safe from the disturbances of the enemy. Discipline hath preceded;
pardon also shall follow.

8\. Let us only, without ceasing to ask, and with full faith that we
shall receive, in simplicity and unanimity beseech the Lord, entreating
not only with groaning but with tears, as it behoves those to entreat
who are situated between the ruins of those who wail, and the remnants
of those who fear; between the manifold slaughter of the yielding, and
the little firmness of those who still stand. Let us ask that peace may
be soon restored; that we may be quickly helped in our concealments and
our dangers; that those things may be fulfilled which the Lord deigns to
show to his servants,-the restoration of the Church, the security of our
salvation; after the rains, serenity; after the darkness, light; after
the storms and whirlwinds, a peaceful calm; the affectionate aids of
paternal love, the accustomed grandeurs of the divine majesty whereby
both the blasphemy of persecutors may be restrained, the repentance of
the lapsed renewed, and the stedfast faith of the persevering may glory.
I bid you, beloved brethren, ever heartily farewell; and have me in
remembrance. Salute the brotherhood in my name; and remind them to
remember me. Farewell.
