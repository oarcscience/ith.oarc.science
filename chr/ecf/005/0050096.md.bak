##  Epistle LXXI.<sup>[1](footnote/fn62.htm#P6248_1976826.md)</sup>

To Stephen, Concerning a Council.

1\. Cyprian and others, to Stephen their brother, greeting. We have
thought it necessary for the arranging of certain matters, dearest
brother, and for their investigation by the examination of a common
council, to gather together and to hold a council, at which many priests
were assembled at once; at which, moreover, many things were brought
forward and transacted. But the subject in regard to which we had
chiefly to write to you, and to confer with your gravity and wisdom, is
one that more especially pertains both to the priestly authority and to
the unity, as well as the dignity, of the Catholic Church, arising as
these do from the ordination of the divine appointment; to wit, that
those who have been dipped abroad outside the Church, and have been
stained among heretics and schismatics with the taint of profane water,
when they come to us and to the Church which is one, ought to be
baptized, for the reason that it is a small
matter<sup>[2](footnote/fn62.htm#P6253_1978275.md)</sup> to "lay hands on
them that they may receive the Holy Ghost," unless they receive also the
baptism of the Church. For then finally can they be fully sanctified,
and be the sons of God, if they be born of each
sacrament;<sup>[3](footnote/fn62.htm#P6254_1978524.md)</sup> since it is
written, "Except a man be born again of water, and of the Spirit, he
cannot enter into the kingdom of
God."<sup>[4](footnote/fn62.htm#P6255_1979149.md)</sup> For we find also,
in the Acts of the Apostles, that this is maintained by the apostles,
and kept in the truth of the saving faith, so that when, in the house of
Cornelius the centurion, the Holy Ghost had descended upon the Gentiles
who were there, fervent in the warmth of their faith, and believing in
the Lord with their whole heart; and when, filled with the Spirit, they
blessed God in divers tongues, still none the less the blessed Apostle
Peter, mindful of the divine precept and the Gospel, commanded that
those same men should be baptized who had already been filled with the
Holy Spirit, that nothing might seem to be neglected to the observance
by the apostolic instruction in all things of the law of the divine
precept and Gospel.<sup>[5](footnote/fn62.htm#P6256_1979947.md)</sup> But
that that is not baptism which the heretics use; and that none of those
who oppose Christ can profit by the grace of Christ; has lately been set
forth with care in the letter which was written on that subject to
Quintus, our colleague, established in Mauritania; as also in a letter
which our colleagues previously wrote to our fellow-bishops presiding in
Numidia, of both which letters I have subjoined copies.

2\. We add, however, and connect with what we have said, dearest
brother, with common consent and authority, that if, again, any
presbyters or deacons, who either have been before ordained in the
Catholic Church, and have subsequently stood forth as traitors and
rebels against the Church, or who have been promoted among the heretics
by a profane ordination by the hands of false bishops and antichrists
contrary to the appointment of Christ, and have attempted to offer; in
opposition to the one and divine altar, false and sacrilegious
sacrifices without, that these also be received when they return, on
this condition, that they communicate as laymen, and hold it to be
enough that they should be received to peace, after having stood forth
as enemies of peace; and that they ought not, on returning, to retain
those arms of ordination and honour with which they rebelled against us.
For it behoves priests and ministers, who wait upon the altar and
sacrifices, to be sound and stainless; since the Lord God speaks in
Leviticus, and says, "No man that hath a stain or a blemish shall come
nigh to offer gifts to the
Lord."<sup>[6](footnote/fn62.htm#P6258_1981740.md)</sup> Moreover, in
Exodus, He prescribes this same thing, and says, "And let the priests
which come near to the Lord God sanctify themselves, lest the Lord
forsake them."<sup>[7](footnote/fn62.htm#P6259_1981922.md)</sup> And again:
"And when they come near to minister at the altar of the holy place,
they shall not bear iniquity upon them, lest they
die."<sup>[8](footnote/fn62.htm#P6260_1982074.md)</sup> But what can be
greater iniquity, or what stain can be more odious, than to have stood
in opposition to Christ; than to have scattered His Church, which He
purchased and founded with His blood; than, unmindful of evangelical
peace and love, to have fought with the madness of hostile discord
against the unanimous and accordant people of God? Such as these,
although they themselves return to the Church, still cannot restore and
recall with them those who, seduced by them, and forestalled by death
without, have perished outside the Church without communion and peace;
whose souls in the day of judgment shall be required at the hands of
those who have stood forth as the authors and leaders of their ruin. And
therefore to such, when they return, it is sufficient that pardon should
be granted; since perfidy ought certainly not to receive promotion in
the household of faith. For what do we reserve for the good and
innocent, and those who do not depart from the Church, if we honour
those who have departed from us, and stood in opposition to the Church?

3\. We have brought these things, dearest brother, to your knowledge,
for the sake of our mutual honour and sincere affection; believing that,
according to the truth of your religion and faith, those things which
are no less religious than true will be approved by you. But we know
that some will not lay aside what they have once imbibed, and do not
easily change their purpose; but, keeping fast the bond of peace and
concord among their colleagues, retain certain things peculiar to
themselves, which have once been adopted among them. In which behalf we
neither do violence to, nor impose a law upon, any one, since each
prelate has in the administration of the Church the exercise of his will
free, as he shall give an account of his conduct to the
Lord.<sup>[9](footnote/fn62.htm#P6262_1983911.md)</sup> We bid you, dearest
brother, ever heartily farewell.
