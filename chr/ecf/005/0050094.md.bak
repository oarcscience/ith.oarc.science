##  Epistle LXIX.<sup>[1](footnote/fn61.md)</sup>

To Januarius and Other Numidian Bishops, on Baptizing Heretics.

another Victor, Cassius, Proculus, Modianus, Cittinus, Gargilius,
Eutycianus, another Gargilius, another Saturninus, Nemesianus, Nampulus,
Antonianus, Rogatianus, Honoratus, greeting. When we were together in
council, dearest brethren, we read your letter which you wrote to us
concerning those who seem to be baptized by heretics and schismatics,
(asking) whether, when the), come to the Catholic Church, which is
one,<sup>[4](footnote/fn62.htm#P6203_1962431.md)</sup> they ought to be
baptized. On which matter, although you yourselves hold thereupon the
truth and certainty of the Catholic rule, yet since you have thought
that of our mutual love we ought to be consulted, we put forward our
opinion, not as a new
one,<sup>[5](footnote/fn62.htm#P6204_1962698.md)</sup> but we join with you
in equal agreement, in an opinion long since decreed by our
predecessors, and observed by us,-judging, namely, and holding it for
certain that no one can be baptized abroad outside the Church, since
there is one baptism appointed in the holy Church. And it is written in
the words of the Lord, "They have forsaken me, the fountain of living
waters, and hewed them out broken cisterns, which can hold no
water."<sup>[6](footnote/fn62.htm#P6205_1963313.md)</sup> And again, sacred
Scripture warns, and says, "Keep thee from the strange water, and drink
not from a fountain of strange
water."<sup>[7](footnote/fn62.htm#P6206_1963458.md)</sup> It is required,
then, that the water should first be cleansed and sanctified by the
priest,<sup>[8](footnote/fn62.htm#P6207_1963574.md)</sup> that it may wash
away by its baptism the sins of the man who is baptized; because the
Lord says by Ezekiel the prophet: "Then will I sprinkle clean water upon
you, and ye shall be cleansed from all your filthiness; and from all
your idols will I cleanse you: a new heart also will I give you, and a
new spirit will I put within
you."<sup>[9](footnote/fn62.htm#P6208_1964101.md)</sup> But how can he
cleanse and sanctify the water who is himself unclean, and in whom the
Holy Spirit is not? since the Lord says in the book of Numbers, "And
whatsoever the unclean person toucheth shall be
unclean."<sup>[10](footnote/fn62.htm#P6209_1964339.md)</sup> Or how can he
who baptizes give to another remission of sins who himself, being
outside the Church, cannot put away his own sins?

2\. But, moreover, the very interrogation which is put in baptism is a
witness of the truth. For when we say, "Dost thou believe in eternal
life and remission of sins through the holy Church? "we mean that
remission of sins is not granted except in the Church, and that among
heretics, where there is no Church, sins cannot be put away. Therefore
they who assert that heretics can baptize, must either change the
interrogation or maintain the truth; unless indeed they attribute a
church also to those who, they contend, have baptism. It is also
necessary that he should be anointed who is baptized; so that, having
received the chrism,<sup>[11](footnote/fn62.htm#P6211_1965122.md)</sup>
that is, the anointing, he may be anointed of God, and have in him the
grace of Christ. Further, it is the Eucharist whence the baptized are
anointed with the oil sanctified on the
altar.<sup>[12](footnote/fn62.htm#P6212_1965405.md)</sup> But he cannot
sanctify the creature of
oil,<sup>[13](footnote/fn62.htm#P6213_1965590.md)</sup> who has neither an
altar nor a church; whence also there can be no spiritual anointing
among heretics, since it is manifest that the oil cannot be sanctified
nor the Eucharist celebrated at all among them. But we ought to know and
remember that it is written, "Let not the oil of a sinner anoint my
head,"<sup>[14](footnote/fn62.htm#P6214_1966103.md)</sup> which the Holy
Spirit before forewarned in the Psalms, lest any one going out of the
way and wandering from the path of truth should be anointed by heretics
and adversaries of Christ. Besides, what prayer can a priest who is
impious and a sinner offer for a baptized person? since it is written,
"God heareth not a sinner; but if any man be a worshipper of God, and
doeth His will, him He
heareth."<sup>[15](footnote/fn62.htm#P6215_1966527.md)</sup> Who, moreover,
can give what he himself has not? or how can he discharge spiritual
functions who himself has lost the Holy Spirit? And therefore he must be
baptized and renewed who comes untrained to the Church, that he may be
sanctified within by those who are holy, since it is written, "Be ye
holy, for I am holy, saith the
Lord."<sup>[16](footnote/fn62.htm#P6216_1966879.md)</sup> So that he who
has been seduced into error, and
baptized<sup>[17](footnote/fn62.htm#P6217_1966954.md)</sup> outside *of the
Church*, should lay aside even this very thing in the true and
ecclesiastical baptism, viz., that he a man coming to God, while he
seeks for a priest, fell by the deceit of error upon a profane one.

3\. But it is to approve the baptism of heretics and schismatics, to
admit that they have truly baptized. For therein a part cannot be void,
and part be valid. If one could baptize, he could also give the Holy
Spirit. But if he cannot give the Holy Spirit, because he that is
appointed without is not endowed with the Holy Spirit, he cannot baptize
those who come; since both baptism is one and the Holy Spirit is one,
and the Church founded by Christ the Lord upon Peter, by a source and
principle of unity,<sup>[18](footnote/fn62.htm#P6219_1967688.md)</sup> is
one also. Hence it results, that since with them all things are futile
and false, nothing of that which they have done ought to be approved by
us. For what can be ratified and established by God which is done by
them whom the Lord calls His enemies and adversaries? setting forth in
His Gospel, "He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth
not with me,
scattereth."<sup>[19](footnote/fn62.htm#P6220_1968118.md)</sup> And the
blessed Apostle John also, keeping the commandments and precepts of the
Lord, has laid it down in his epistle, and said, "Ye have heard that
antichrist shall come: even now there are many Antichrists; whereby we
know that it is the last time. They went out from us, but they were not
of us; for if they had been of us, no doubt they would have continued
with us."<sup>[20](footnote/fn62.htm#P6221_1968508.md)</sup> Whence we also
ought to gather and consider whether they who are the Lord's
adversaries, and are called antichrists, can give the grace of Christ.
Wherefore we who are with the Lord, and maintain the unity of the Lord,
and according to His condescension administer His priesthood in the
Church, ought to repudiate and reject and regard as profane whatever His
adversaries and the antichrists do; and to those who, coming out of
error and wickedness, acknowledge the true faith of the one Church, we
should give the truth both of unity and faith, by means of all the
sacraments of divine
grace.<sup>[21](footnote/fn62.htm#P6222_1969127.md)</sup> We bid you,
dearest brethren, ever heartily farewell.
