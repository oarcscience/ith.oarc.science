##  Introductory Notice to Hippolytus

------------

\[a.d. 170-236.\]The first great Christian Father whose history is Roman
is, nevertheless, not a Roman, but a Greek. He is the disciple of
Irenaeus, and the spirit of his life-work rejects that of his master. In
his personal character he so much resembles Irenaeus risen
again,<sup>[1](footnote/fn2.htm#P225_10553.md)</sup> that the great Bishop
of Lyons must be well studied and understood if we would do full justice
to the conduct of Hippolytus. Especially did he follow his master's
example in withstanding contemporary bishops of Rome, who, like Victor,
"deserved to be blamed," but who, much more than any of their
predecessors, merited rebuke alike for error in doctrine and viciousness
of life.

In the year 1551, while some excavations were in progress near the
ancient Church of St. Lawrence at Rome, on the Tiburtine Road, there was
found an ancient statue, in marble, of a figure seated in a chair, and
wearing over the Roman tunic the *pallium* of Tertullian's eulogy. It
was in 1851, just three hundred years after its discovery, and in the
year of the publication of the newly discovered *Philosophumena* at
Oxford, that I saw it in the Vatican. As a specimen of early Christian
art it is a most interesting work, and possesses a higher merit than
almost any similar production of a period subsequent to that of the
Antonines.<sup>[2](footnote/fn2.htm#P227_11692.md)</sup> It represents a
grave personage, of noble features and a high, commanding forehead,
slightly bearded, his right hand resting over his heart, while under it
his left arm crosses the body to reach a book placed at his side. There
is no reason to doubt that this is, indeed, the statue of Hippolytus, as
is stated in the inscription of Pius IV., who calls him "Saint
Hippolytus, Bishop of Portus," and states that he lived in the reign of
the Emperor Alexander; i.e., Severus.

Of this there is evidence on the chair itself, which represents his
episcopal *cathedra*, and has a modest symbol of lions at "the stays,"
as if borrowed from the throne of Solomon. It is a work of later date
than the age of Severus, no doubt; but Wordsworth, who admirably
illustrates the means by which such a statue may have been provided,
gives us good reasons for supposing that it may have been the grateful
tribute of contemporaries, and all the more trustworthy as a portrait of
the man himself. The chair has carved upon it, no doubt for use in the
Church, a calendar indicating the Paschal full moons for seven cycles of
sixteen years each; answering, according to the science of the period,
to similar tables in the Anglican Book of Common Prayer. It indicates
the days on which Easter must fall, from a.d. 222 to a.d. 333. On the
back of the chair is a list of the author's
works.<sup>[3](footnote/fn2.htm#P229_13167.md)</sup>

Not less interesting, and vastly more important, was the discovery, at
Mount Athos, in 1842, of the long-lost *Philosophumena* of this author,
concerning which the important facts will appear below. Its learned
editor, Emmanuel Miller, published it at Oxford under the name of
Origen, which was inscribed on the Ms. Like the Epistle of Clement, its
composition in the Greek language had given it currency among the
Easterns long after it was forgotten in the West; and very naturally
they had ascribed to Origen an anonymous treatise containing much in
coincidence with his teachings, and supplying the place of one of his
works of a similar kind. It is now sufficiently established as the work
of Hippolytus, and has been providentially brought to light just when it
was most needed.<sup>[4](footnote/fn2.htm#P231_14419.md)</sup> In fact, the
statue rose from its grave as if to rebuke the reigning pontiff (Pius
IV.), who just then imposed upon the Latin churches the novel "Creed"
which bears his name; and now the *Philosophumena* comes forth as if to
breathe a last warning to that namesake of the former Pius who, in the
very teeth of its testimony, so recently forged and uttered the dogma of
"papal infallibility" conferring this attribute upon himself, and
retrospectively upon the very bishops of Rome whom St. Hippolytus
resisted as heretics, and has transmitted to posterity, in his writings,
branded with the shame alike of false doctrine and of heinous crimes.
Dr. Dollinger, who for a time lent his learning and genius to an
apologetic effort in behalf of the Papacy, was no doubt prepared, by
this very struggle of his heart *versus* head, for that rejection of the
new dogma which overloaded alike his intellect and his conscience, and
made it impossible for him any longer to bear the lashes of
Rehoboam<sup>[5](footnote/fn2.htm#P232_15558.md)</sup> in communion with
modern Rome.

In the biographical *data* which will be found below, enough is supplied
for the needs of the reader of the present series, who, if he wishes
further to investigate the subject, will find the fullest information in
the works to which reference has been made, or which will be hereafter
indicated.<sup>[6](footnote/fn2.htm#P234_15925.md)</sup> But this is the
place to recur to the much-abused passage of Irenaeus which I have
discussed in a former volume.<sup>[7](footnote/fn2.htm#P235_16075.md)</sup>
Strange to say, I was forced to correct, from a Roman-Catholic writer,
the very unsatisfactory rendering of our Edinburgh editors, and to
elucidate at some length the palpable absurdity of attributing to
Irenaeus any other than a geographical and imperial reference to the
importance of Rome, and its usefulness to the West, more especially, as
its only see of apostolic origin. Quoting the Ninth Antiochian Canon, I
gave good reasons for my conjecture that the Latin *convenire*
represents suntrexein in the original; and now it remains to be noted
how strongly the real meaning of Irenaeus is illustrated in the life and
services of his pupil Hippolytus.

1\. That neither Hippolytus nor his master had any conception that the
See of Rome possesses any pre-eminent authority, to which others are
obliged to defer, is conspicuously evident from the history of both.
Alike they convicted Roman bishops of error, and alike they rebuked them
for their misconduct.

2\. Hippolytus is the author of a work called the *Little Labyrinth*,
which, like the recently discovered *Philosophumena*, attributes to the
Roman See anything but the "infallibility" which the quotation from
Irenaeus is so ingeniously wrested to
sustain.<sup>[8](footnote/fn2.htm#P238_17294.md)</sup> How he did *not*
understand the passage is, therefore, sufficiently apparent. Let us next
inquire what appears, from his conduct, to be the true understanding of
Irenaeus.

3\. I have shown, in the elucidation already referred to, how Irenaeus
affirms that Rome is the city which everybody visits from all parts, and
that Christians, resorting thither, because it is the Imperial City,
*carry into it* the testimony of all other churches. Thus it becomes a
competent witness to the *quod ab omnibus*, because it cannot be
ignorant of what all the churches teach with one accord. This argument,
therefore, reverses the modern Roman dogma; primitive Rome *received*
orthodoxy instead of prescribing it. She embosomed the Catholic
testimony *brought into* it from all the churches, and gave it forth as
reflected light; not primarily her own, but what she faithfully
preserved in coincidence with older and more learned churches than
herself. Doubtless she had been planted and watered by St. Paul and St.
Peter; but doubtless, also, she had been expressly warned by the former
of her liability to error and to final
severance<sup>[9](footnote/fn2.htm#P240_18454.md)</sup> from apostolic
communion. Hippolytus lived at a critical moment, when this awful
admonition seemed about to be realized.

4\. Now, then, from Portus and from Lyons, Hippolytus brought into Rome
the Catholic doctrine, and convicted two of its bishops of pernicious
heresies and evil living. And thus, as Irenaeus teaches, the faith was
preserved in Rome by the testimony of those *from every side resorting
thither*, not by any prerogative of the See itself. All this will appear
clearly enough as the student proceeds in the examination of this
volume. But it is now time to avail ourselves of the information given
us by the translator in his Introductory Notice, as follows:-

The entire of *The Refutation of all Heresies*, with the exception of
book i., was found in a ms. brought from a convent on Mount Athos so
recently as the year 1842. The discoverer of this treasure-for treasure
it certainly is-was Minoides Mynas, an erudite Greek, who had visited
his native country in search of ancient mss., by direction of M. Abel
Villemain, Minister of Public Instruction under Louis Philippe. The
French Government have thus the credit of being instrumental in bringing
to light this valuable work, while the University of Oxford shares the
distinction by being its earliest publishers. *The Refutation* was
printed at the Clarendon Press in 1851, under the editorship of M.
Emmanuel Miller,<sup>[10](footnote/fn2.htm#P243_19904.md)</sup> whose
labours have proved serviceable to all subsequent commentators. One
generally acknowledged mistake was committed by Miller in ascribing the
work to Origen. He was right in affirming that the discovered ms. was
the continuation of the fragment, *The Philosophumena*, inserted in the
Benedictine copy of Origen's works. In the volume, however, containing
the *Philosophumena*, we have dissertations by Huet, in which he
questions Origen's authorship in favour of Epiphanius. Heuman attributed
the *Philosophumena* to Didymus of Alexandria, Gale to
Aetius;<sup>[11](footnote/fn2.htm#P244_20516.md)</sup> and it, with the
rest of *The Refutation*, Fessler and Baur ascribed to Caius, but the
Abbe Jellabert to Tertullian. The last hypothesis is untenable, if for
no other reason, because the work is in Greek. In many respects, Caius,
who was a presbyter of Rome in the time of Victor and Zephyrinus, would
seem the probable author; but a fatal argument-one applicable to those
named above, except Epiphanius-against Caius is his not being, as the
author of *The Refutation* in the *Proemium* declares himself to be, a
bishop. Epiphanius no doubt filled the episcopal office; but when we
have a large work of his on the heresies, with a
summary,<sup>[12](footnote/fn2.htm#P245_21208.md)</sup> it would seem
scarcely probable that he composed likewise, on the same topic, an
extended treatise like the present, with two abridgments. Whatever
diversity of opinion, however, existed as to these claimants, most
critics, though not all, now agree in denying the authorship of Origen.
Neither the style nor tone of *The Refutation* is Origenian. Its
compilatory process is foreign to Origen's plan of composition; while
the subject matter itself, for many reasons, would not be likely to have
occupied the pen of the Alexandrine Father. It is almost impossible but
that Origen would have made some allusions in *The Refutation* to his
other writings, or in them to it. Not only, however, is there no such
allusion, but the derivation of the word "Ebionites," in *The
Refutation*, and an expressed belief in the (orthodox) doctrine of
eternal punishment, are at variance with Origen's authorship. Again, no
work answering the description is awarded to Origen in catalogues of his
extant or lost writings. These arguments are strengthened by the facts,
that Origen was never a bishop, and that he did not reside for any
length of time at Rome. He once paid a hurried visit to the capital of
the West, whereas the author of *The Refutation* asserts his presence at
Rome during the occurrence of events which occupied a period of some
twenty years. And not only was he a spectator, but took part in these
transactions in such an official and authoritative manner as Origen
could never have assumed, either at Rome or elsewhere.

In this state of the controversy, commentators turned their attention
towards Hippolytus, in favour of whose authorship the majority of modern
scholars have decided. The arguments that have led to this conclusion,
and those alleged by others against it, could not be adequately
discussed in a notice like the present. Suffice it to say, that such
names as Jacobi, Gieseler, Duncker, Schneidewin, Bernays, Bunsen,
Wordsworth, and Dollinger, support the claims of Hippolytus. The
testimony of Dr. Dollinger, considering the extent of his theological
learning, and in particular his intimate acquaintance with the apostolic
period in church history, virtually, we submit, decides the
question.<sup>[13](footnote/fn2.htm#P247_23461.md)</sup>

For a biography of Hippolytus we have not much authentic materials.
There can be no reasonable doubt but that he was a bishop, and passed
the greater portion of his life in Rome and its vicinity. This assertion
corresponds with the conclusion adopted by Dr. Dollinger, who, however,
refuses to allow that Hippolytus was, as is generally maintained, Bishop
of Portus, a harbour of Rome at the northern mouth of the Tiber,
opposite Ostia. However, it is satisfactory to establish, and especially
upon such eminent authority as that of Dr. Dollinger, the fact of
Hippolytus' connection with the Western Church, not only because it
bears on the investigation of the authorship of *The Refutation*, the
writer of which affirms his personal observation of what he records as
occurring in his own time at Rome, but also because it overthrows the
hypothesis of those who contend that there were more Hippolytuses than
one-Dr. Dollinger shows that there is only one historical Hippolytus-or
that the East, and not Italy, was the sphere of his episcopal labours.
Thus Le Moyne, in the seventeenth century, a French writer resident in
Leyden, ingeniously argues that Hippolytus was bishop of *Portus
Romanorum* (Aden), in Arabia. Le Moyne's theory was adopted by some
celebrities, viz., Dupin, Tillemont, Spanheim, Basnage, and our own Dr.
Cave. To this position are opposed, among others, the names of
Nicephorus, Syncellus, Baronius, Bellarmine, Dodwell, Beveridge, Bull,
and Archbishop Ussher. The judgment and critical accuracy of Ussher is,
on a point of this kind, of the highest value. Wherefore the question of
Hippolytus being bishop of Portus near Rome would also appear
established, for the reasons laid down in Bunsen's *Letters to
Archdeacon Hare*, and Canon Wordsworth's *St. Hippolytus*. The mind of
inquirers appears to have been primarily unsettled in consequence of
Eusebius' mentioning Hippolytus (*Ecclesiast. Hist., vi. 10*) in company
with Beryllus (of Bostra), an Arabian, expressing at the same time his
uncertainty as to where Hippolytus was bishop. This indecision is easily
explained, and cannot invalidate the tradition and historical testimony
which assign the bishopric of Portus near Rome to Hippolytus, a saint
and martyr of the Church. Of his martyrdom, though the fact itself is
certain, the details, furnished in Prudentius' hymn, are not historic.
Thus the mode of Hippolytus' death is stated by Prudentius to have been
identical with that of Hippolytus the son of Theseus, who was torn limb
from limb by being tied to wild horses. St. Hippolytus, however, is
known on historical testimony to have been thrown into a canal and
drowned; but whether the scene of his martyrdom its Sardinia, to which
he undoubtedly banished along with the Roman bishop Pontianus, or Rome,
or Portus, has not as yet been definitively proved. The time of his
martyrdom, however, is probably a year or two, perhaps less or more,
after the commencement of the reign of Maximin the Thracian, that is,
somewhere about a.d. 235-39. This enables us to determine the age of
Hippolytus; and as some statements in *The Refutation* evince the work
to be the composition of an old man, and as the work itself was written
after the death of Callistus in a.d. 222, this would transfer the period
of his birth to not very long after the last half of the second century.

The contents of *The Refutation*, as they originally stood, seem to have
been arranged thus: The first book (which we have) contained an account
of the different schools of ancient philosophers; the second (which is
missing), the doctrines and mysteries of the Egyptians; the third
(likewise missing), the Chaldean science and astrology; and the fourth
(the beginning of which is missing), the system of the Chaldean
horoscope, and the magical rites and incantations of the Babylonian
Theurgists. Next came the portion of the work relating more immediately
to the heresies of the Church, which is contained in books v.-ix. The
tenth book is the *résumé* of the entire, together with the exposition
of the author's own religious opinions. The heresies enumerated by
Hippolytus comprehend a period starting from an age prior to the
composition of St. John's Gospel, and terminating with the death of
Callistus. The heresies are explained according to chronological
development, and may be ranged under five leading schools: (1) The
Ophites; (1) Simonists; (3) Basilidians; (4) Docetae; (5) Noetians.
Hippolytus ascends to the origin of heresy, not only in assigning
heterodoxy a derivative nature from heathenism, but in pointing out in
the *Gnossis* elements of abnormal opinions antecedent to the
promulgation of Christianity. We have thus a most interesting account of
the early heresies, which in some respects supplies many *desiderata* in
the ecclesiastical history of this epoch.

We can scarcely over-estimate the value of *The Refutation*, on account
of the propinquity of its author to the apostolic age. Hippolytus was a
disciple of St. Irenaeus, St. Irenaeus of St. Polycarp, St. Polycarp of
St. John. Indeed, one fact of grave importance connected with the
writings of St. John, is elicited from Hippolytus' *Refutation*. The
passage given out of Basilides' work, containing a quotation by the
heretic from St. John i. g, settles the period of the composition of the
fourth Gospel, as of greater antiquity by at least thirty years than is
allowed to it by the Tubingen school. It is therefore obvious that
Basilides formed his system out of the prologue of St. John's Gospel;
thus for ever setting at rest the allegation of these critics, that St.
John's Gospel was written at a later date, and assigned an apostolic
author, in order to silence the Basilidian
Gnostics.<sup>[14](footnote/fn2.htm#P251_29211.md)</sup> In the case of
Irenaeus, too, *The Refutation* has restored the Greek text of much of
his book Against *Heresies*, hitherto only known to us in a Latin
version. Nor is the value of Hippolytus' work seriously impaired, even
on the supposition of the authorship not being proved,-a concession,
however, in no wise justified by the evidence. Whoever the writer of
*The Refutation* be, he belonged to the early portion of the third
century, formed his compilations from primitive sources, made
conscientious preparation for his undertaking, delivered statements
confirmed by early writers of
note,<sup>[15](footnote/fn2.htm#P252_29843.md)</sup> and lastly, in the
execution of his task, furnished indubitable marks of information and
research, and of having thoroughly mastered the relations and
affinities, each to other, of the various heresies of the first two and
a quarter centuries. These heresies, whether deducible from attempts to
Christianize the philosophy of Paganism, or to interpret the Doctrines
and Life of our Lord by the tenets of Gnosticism and Oriental
speculation generally, or to create a compromise with the pretensions of
Judaism,-these heresies, amid all their complexity and diversity, St.
Hippolytus<sup>[16](footnote/fn2.htm#P253_30470.md)</sup> reduces to one
common ground of censure-antagonism to Holy Scripture. Heresy, thus
branded, he leaves to wither under the condemnatory sentence of the
Church.
