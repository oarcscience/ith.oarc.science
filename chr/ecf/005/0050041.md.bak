##  Epistle XVI

The Confessors to
Cyprian.<sup>[1](footnote/fn50.htm#P5025_1529749.md)</sup>

All the confessors to
father<sup>[2](footnote/fn50.htm#P5029_1529885.md)</sup> Cyprian, greeting.
Know that, to all, concerning whom the account of what they have done
since the commission of their sin has been, in your estimation,
satisfactory, we have granted peace; and we have desired that this
rescript should be made known by you to the other bishops also. We bid
you to have peace with the holy martyrs. Lucianus wrote this, there
being present of the clergy, both an exorcist and a reader.
