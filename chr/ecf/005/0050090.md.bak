##  Epistle LXV.<sup>[1](footnote/fn60.htm#P6070_1913459.md)</sup>

To the Clergy and People Abiding at Furni, About Victor, Who Had Made
the Presbyter Faustinus a Guardian.

1\. Cyprian to the presbyters, and deacons, and people abiding at Furni,
greeting. I and my colleagues who were present with me were greatly
disturbed, dearest brethren, as were also our fellow-presbyters who sate
with us, when we were made aware that Geminius Victor, our brother, when
departing this life, had named Geminius Faustinus the presbyter executor
to his will, although long since it was decreed, in a council of the
bishops, that no one should appoint any of the clergy and the ministers
of God executor or
guardian<sup>[2](footnote/fn60.htm#P6075_1914519.md)</sup> by his will,
since every one honoured by the divine priesthood, and ordained in the
clerical service, ought to serve only the altar and sacrifices, and to
have leisure for prayers and supplications. For it is written: "No man
that warreth for God entangleth himself with the affairs of this life,
that he may please Him to whom he has pledged
himself."<sup>[3](footnote/fn60.htm#P6076_1914967.md)</sup> As this is said
of all men, how much rather ought those not to be bound by worldly
anxieties and involvements, who, being busied with divine and spiritual
things, are not able to withdraw from the Church, and to have leisure
for earthly and secular doings! The form of which ordination and
engagement the Levites formerly observed under the law, so that when the
eleven tribes divided the land and shared the possessions, the Levitical
tribe, which was left free for the temple and the altar, and for the
divine ministries, received nothing from that portion of the division;
but while others cultivated the soil, that portion only cultivated the
favour of God, and received the tithes from the eleven tribes, for their
food and maintenance, from the fruits which grew. All which was done by
divine authority and arrangement, so that they who waited on divine
services might in no respect be called away, nor be compelled to
consider or to transact secular business. Which plan and rule is now
maintained in respect of the clergy, that they who are promoted by
clerical ordination in the Church of the Lord may be called off in no
respect from the divine administration, nor be tied down by worldly
anxieties and matters; but in the honour of the brethren who contribute,
receiving as it were tenths of the fruits, they may not withdraw from
the altars and sacrifices, but may serve day and might in heavenly and
spiritual things.

2\. The bishops our predecessors religiously considering this, and
wholesomely providing for it, decided that no brother departing should
name a cleric for executor or guardian; and if any one should do this,
no offering should be made for him, nor any sacrifice be celebrated for
his repose.<sup>[4](footnote/fn60.htm#P6078_1916772.md)</sup> For he does
not deserve to be named at the altar of God in the prayer of the
priests, who has wished to call away the priests and ministers from the
altar. And therefore, since Victor, contrary to the rule lately made in
council by the priests, has dared to appoint Geminius Faustinus, a
presbyter, his executor, it is not allowed that any offering be made by
you for his repose, nor any prayer be made in the church in his name,
that so the decree of the priests, religiously and needfully made, may
be kept by us; and, at the same time, an example be given to the rest of
the brethren, that no one should call away to secular anxieties the
priests and ministers of God who are occupied with the service of His
altar and Church. For care will probably be taken in time to come that
this happen not with respect to the person of clerics any more, if what
has now been done has been punished. I bid you, dearest brethren, ever
heartily farewell.
