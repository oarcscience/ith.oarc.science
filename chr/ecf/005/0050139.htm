<p>--------</p>  
<p>P. 609. The author's elucidation of the figure, <i>anthropopathy</i>, is an enlargement of Clement's casual remarks in the <i>Stromata</i> (cap. xvi. vol. ii. p. 363, this series). Consult <i>On the Figurative Language of Holy Scripture</i>, Jones of Nayland, <i>Works</i>, vol. iv. ed. 1801.</p>  
<p>P. 630, note 5. Compare Waterland, vol. ii. p. 210, ed. 1823; also <i>Life of Bishop Bull</i>, by Robert Nelson, p. 260. For the extraordinary history of Bull's work in France, see the said <i>Life</i>, pp. 327-333. For Petavius, Waterland, vol. ii. p. 277, and Bull's <i>Life</i>, p. 243. <i>Petavius</i> seems to have had a crafty design to sustain the Council of Trent by arguing that the Council of Nicaea also made <i>new</i> dogmas. Bull proves that it only <i>bore witness to the old</i>. To the honour of the assembled bishops of the Gallican Church, they sustained Bull against the Jesuit. </p>
