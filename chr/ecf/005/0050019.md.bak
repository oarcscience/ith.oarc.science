##  Elucidation.

The conduct of Father Abraham, although not approved of by Inspiration,
but simply recorded (Genesis 26:7), gave early Christians an opinion
that the wicked may be justly foiled, by equivocation and deception, for
the preservation of innocence or the life of the innocent. In such case
the person deceived, they might argue, is not injured, but benefited
(Genesis 26:10), being saved from committing violence and murder. The
Corinthian maiden was accustomed to be veiled (as Tertullian intimates),
and was taught alike to cherish her own purity and to have no share in
affording occasion of sin to others. See vol. iv. pp. 32, 33. Let us
call this narrative "The Story of Corinthia and Magistrianus."
