*Letters of Cyprian to Quintus*, to *Fubaianus*, to *Pompey*, on "the
baptism of heretics; "and to *Magnus* on "baptizing the Novatians, and
those who obtain grace on a sick-bed," may be found translated in Ep.
lxx. (p. 377, *supra*), Ep. lxxii. (p. 379, *supra*), Ep. lxxiii. (p.
386, *supra*), and Ep. lxxv. (p. 397, *supra*), respectively; and the
Letter of *Firmilian* to Cyprian against the *Letter of Stephen*, at p.
390, supra, Ep. lxxiv. All these letters are repeated, *in extenso*, in
the *Monumenta Veterum*.

Eusebius says, by way of introduction to the fragment of a letter
written to Stephen by Dionysius of Alexandria, as follows: "Dionysius
indited to Stephen the first of those letters which were written on the
subject of baptism, when no small controversy had arisen whether they
who are converted from any kind of heresy ought to be purged by baptism
(because an ancient custom had prevailed, that in receiving such there
should only be hands laid upon them, with prayers). Cyprian, who then
ruled the Church of Carthage, was the first who judged that they must
not be admitted to communion unless they were first purified from error
by baptism. But Stephen, thinking that nothing should be innovated
contrary to the tradition which had already obtained in that matter from
the beginning, was indignant at this. And as Dionysius had already
written many letters to him on this argument, he intimates to him
finally, that all the churches everywhere, now that the fury of
persecution was abated, detesting the turbulent novelty of
Novatian,<sup>[63](footnote/fn108.md)</sup> had established peace with one
another." parparpar
