##  Introductory Notice<sup>[1](footnote/fn105.md)</sup> To an Anonymous Treatise Against the Heretic Novatian.

--------

The writer of the following treatise was undoubtedly a contemporary of
Cyprian, and wrote in the early part of the reign of Valerian (254-256),
during an interval of peace to the Church. This much may be collected
from the fact that he names one, and only one, persecution after that of
Decius-namely, that of Gallus and Volusianus-and speaks of those who had
lapsed under the former, as having been stedfast and victorious in the
latter.<sup>[2](footnote/fn105.htm#P10590_3335412.md)</sup> He is generally
believed to have been an Africa, and Tillemont is only withheld from
attributing the work to Cyprian himself by what he judges to be a
difference of style. But although from the exordium it may be concluded
that the writer was a bishop, yet, from his manifest uncertainty as to
the fitting way to treat those who had lapsed, it is evident that
Cyprian cannot have been the author; for that prelate, when the
persecution of Gallus and Volusianus was just threatening, had already
decided upon receiving to communion the penitents who had yielded to
temptation under
Decius.<sup>[3](footnote/fn105.htm#P10591_3336035.md)</sup>

Ceillier<sup>[4](footnote/fn105.htm#P10593_3336079.md)</sup> says that this
treatise was written about the year 255, while Novatian was still
alive,<sup>[5](footnote/fn105.htm#P10594_3336235.md)</sup> and when the
schism of Felicissimus was all but extinct.

Erasmus first published it among the known works of Cyprian in the year
1520.

Note.

The American editor subjoins as follows: Cyprian, and Cornelius
afterward, had decided, with their councils, that the lapsed should be
classed, and dealt with accordingly, as (1) *Libellatici*, those who had
compounded with the heathen, and *bought off* from offering sacrifice;
and (2) *Sacrificati*, those who had actually offered sacrifice to
idols. Different degrees of discipline were awarded, but all were
admitted to pardon finally.
