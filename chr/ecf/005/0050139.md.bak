##  Two Notes by the American Editor.

--------

P. 609. The author's elucidation of the figure, *anthropopathy*, is an
enlargement of Clement's casual remarks in the *Stromata* (cap. xvi.
vol. ii. p. 363, this series). Consult *On the Figurative Language of
Holy Scripture*, Jones of Nayland, *Works*, vol. iv. ed. 1801.

P. 630, note 5. Compare Waterland, vol. ii. p. 210, ed. 1823; also *Life
of Bishop Bull*, by Robert Nelson, p. 260. For the extraordinary history
of Bull's work in France, see the said *Life*, pp. 327-333. For
Petavius, Waterland, vol. ii. p. 277, and Bull's *Life*, p. 243.
*Petavius* seems to have had a crafty design to sustain the Council of
Trent by arguing that the Council of Nicaea also made *new* dogmas. Bull
proves that it only *bore witness to the old*. To the honour of the
assembled bishops of the Gallican Church, they sustained Bull against
the Jesuit.
