##  A Treatise Against the Heretic Novatian by an Anonymous Bishop.

--------

1\. While I was meditating and impatiently tossing in my mind what I
ought to do concerning those pitiable brethren who, wounded, not of
their own will, but by the onset of a raging devil, have lived until
now, that is, through a long course of time, in the endurance of their
punishment; lo, there appeared opposed to me another enemy, and the
adversary of his own paternal affection-the heretic Novatian-who not
only, as it is signified in the Gospel, passed by the prostrate wounded
man, as did the priest or the Levite, but by an ingenious and novel
cruelty rather would slay the wounded man, by taking away the hope of
salvation, by denying the mercy of his Father, by rejecting the
repentance of his brother. Marvellous, how bitter, how harsh, how
perverse are many things! But one more easily perceives the straw in
another's eye than the beam in one's own. Let not the abrupt madness of
that perfidious heretic move or disturb us however, beloved brethren,
who, although he is placed in such great guilt of dissension and schism,
and is separated from the Church, with sacrilegious temerity does not
shrink from hurling back his charges upon us: for although he is now by
himself made unclean, defiled with the filth of sacrilege, he contends
that we are so. And although it is written that the dogs should remain
without, and the apostle has taught that these same dogs must be
shunned, as we read, for he says, "Beware of dogs, beware of evil
workers,"<sup>[1](footnote/fn106.md)</sup> he does not cease stirring up
his frenzy with barkings, after the manner of wolves seeking the gloomy
darkness, where with his brutal cruelty he may easily rend in his dark
caves the sheep snatched away from the Shepherd. Certainly he declares
that he and his friends whom he collects are gold. Nor do we doubt but
that deserters of the Church who have become apostates could now easily
be converted into gold, but it must be that gold in which the first sins
of the people of Israel were designated. But the gold and silver vessels
which were wrested from the Egyptians continue in the Lord's power, that
is, in Christ's Church; in which house if thou hadst continued,
Novatian, thou hadst perchance been also a precious vessel; but now thou
neither perceivest nor complainest that thou art changed into chaff and
straw.

2\. Why, therefore, shouldst thou be lifted up with vain things? Thou
wilt gain loss rather than profit. Why, from the very fact that thou art
become poorer, believest thou thyself rich? Hear in the Apocalypse the
Lord's voice rebuking thee with righteous reproaches: "Thou sayest,"
says He, "I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing;
and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and blind, and
poor, and naked."<sup>[2](footnote/fn106.htm#P10609_3339720.md)</sup> Let
him think for certain that he possesses these riches of poverty, whoever
he may be, that, forsaking the Church of Christ, with his darkened
reason does not shrink from being turned to those rash leaders of
schisms and authors of dissension, whom John calls antichrists, whom the
Evangelist likens to chaff, whom the Lord Christ characterizes as
thieves and robbers, as He Himself declares in the Gospel, saying that
"he who entereth not by the door into the sheep-fold, but goeth down by
some other way, the same is a thief and a
robber."<sup>[3](footnote/fn106.htm#P10610_3340280.md)</sup> Moreover, in
the same He also says, "All who have come are thieves and
robbers."<sup>[4](footnote/fn106.htm#P10611_3340375.md)</sup> Who are such
but the deserters of the faith, and the transgressors of God's Church,
who strive against God's ordinance; whom the Holy Spirit rightly rebukes
by the prophet, saying, "Ye have taken counsel, but not by me; and *have
made* a confederacy, but not by my Spirit, to add sin to
sin."<sup>[5](footnote/fn106.htm#P10612_3340680.md)</sup> What now can
those most perverse friends of Novatian, even now the most
unhappy<sup>[6](footnote/fn106.htm#P10613_3340776.md)</sup> few, reply to
these things, who have broken forth to such a folly of madness as to
have no reverence either for God or man? Among them, shamelessly, and
without any law of ordination, the episcopate is sought after; but among
us in its own Sees, and in those of the throne delivered to it by God,
it is renounced.<sup>[7](footnote/fn106.htm#P10614_3341227.md)</sup> There
the Truth says, "They reject me, that they may sacrifice to me; nor do
they offer the holy oblations of the children of Israel, nor do they
approach to offer the holy of holies, but they shall receive their
ignominy in the error wherein they have
erred."<sup>[8](footnote/fn106.htm#P10615_3341526.md)</sup> Let it be
enough in a few words to have proved what they are. Hear, therefore, O
Novatians, among whom the heavenly Scriptures are read rather than
understood; well, if they are not
interpolated.<sup>[9](footnote/fn106.htm#P10616_3341744.md)</sup> For your
ears are closed, and your hearts darkened, seeing that ye admit no light
from spiritual and saving warnings; as Isaiah gays, "The servants of God
are blinded."<sup>[10](footnote/fn106.htm#P10617_3341946.md)</sup> And
deservedly blinded, because the desire of schismatics is not in the law;
which law points out to us the one and only Church in that ark to wit,
which was fashioned, by the providence of God, under Noah before the
deluge, in which-to answer you quickly, O Novatian-we find that there
were shut up not only clean animals, but also unclean; which ark was
saved alone, with those who were in it, whereas the other things which
were not found therein perished in the deluge. From that ark there were
loosed two birds, a raven and a dove; and this raven truly bore the
figure or type of impure men, and men who would be in perpetual darkness
through the world's broad road, and of apostates who should arise,
feeding on unclean things, and not turning themselves eventually to the
Church; and as we read, we find that it was sent forth, and returned no
more. Whoever should be found to resemble this bird, then, that is, the
impure spirit, will no more be able to return to the Church, seeing that
the Lord will forbid them, even if they should wish it, as He commanded
Moses, saying, "Everything
leprous<sup>[11](footnote/fn106.htm#P10618_3343069.md)</sup> and impure,
cast abroad outside the
camp."<sup>[12](footnote/fn106.htm#P10619_3343125.md)</sup> But the dove
sent forth that returned, is signified by the man who does not delay,
because be would have no rest for his feet. And Noah received it into
the ark; and when it was sent forth again on the seventh day, received
it, bearing in its mouth an olive leaf.

3\. And I, beloved brethren,-as I not heedlessly meditate these things,
and not in harmony with human wisdom, but as it is permitted to our
minds by the condescension of the heavenly Lord, needfully and
pertinently to conceive,-say that that dove signifies to us of itself a
double type. Formerly, that is, from the beginning of the divine
administration, it suggests its own figure, the first indeed and
chief-that is, the figure of the Spirit. And by its mouth the sacrament
of baptism which is provided for the salvation of the human race, and
that by the heavenly plan it is celebrated in the Church
only.<sup>[13](footnote/fn106.htm#P10621_3344013.md)</sup> Moreover, three
times sent forth from the ark, flying about through the air over the
water, it already signified the sacraments of our Church. Whence also
the Lord Christ charges upon Peter, and moreover also upon the rest of
His disciples, "Go ye and preach the Gospel to the nations, baptizing
them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
Ghost."<sup>[14](footnote/fn106.htm#P10622_3344507.md)</sup> That is, that
that same Trinity which operated figuratively in Noah's days through the
dove, now operates in the Church spiritually through the disciples.

4\. Let us now take the second character also of the dove sent forth
from the ark, that is to say, in the time of the deluge, when all the
abysses broke forth; when the cataracts of heaven were opened upon the
earth, on account of the wickedness of men which they daily practised
before the Lord; as said Moses, "And the Lord God saw that the
wickednesses of men were overflowing upon the earth, and that all of
them were remembering for evil from the beginning of their days; and He
said, I will destroy man whom I have made from off the face of the
earth, from man even unto cattle, and from the creeping thing even unto
the fowls of the air."<sup>[15](footnote/fn106.htm#P10624_3345370.md)</sup>
Therefore in the time of the flood the dove is sent forth from the ark,
when the waters were violently rushing with all their force upon the
earth.

5\. That ark bore the figure of the Church, as we have said above, which
was stricken hither and thither to such a degree by the tumultuous
waters. Therefore that deluge which happened under Noah showed forth the
figure of the persecution which now lately was poured forth over the
whole world. Moreover, by the waters, the cataracts broken forth meeting
together on all sides, and growing, were signified the peoples which
grew up for the desolation of the Church; as the Apocalypse teaches,
saying, "The waters which thou sawest are peoples, and nations, and
kingdoms."<sup>[16](footnote/fn106.htm#P10626_3346107.md)</sup> Moreover,
the dove which could not find rest for its feet, bore the likeness of
the lapsed, who fell forgetful of the divine announcements, either
ignorant in simplicity, or feigning in audacity. Of whom the Lord had
intimated the future destruction in the Gospel in these words, saying,
"He who heareth my words and doeth them not, I will liken him to a
foolish man, who built his house upon the sand: the tempests came and
beat upon that house, and it fell; and great was its
destruction."<sup>[17](footnote/fn106.htm#P10627_3346620.md)</sup> And lest
we should seem to have made the comparison inconsiderately of that dove
bearing the image of the lapsed, the prophet rebukes the city as a dove,
that is, the character of the lapsed, saying, "The dove hearkens not to
the voice; that is, the illustrious and redeemed city receives not
teaching, and trusted not in the
Lord."<sup>[18](footnote/fn106.htm#P10628_3346977.md)</sup>

6\. Moreover, that that dove could not find rest for her feet, as we
have said above, this signified the footsteps of those who deny; that
is, those, wounded by the poison of the shining serpent, who sacrifice,
turned towards their fall; which could not any further step upon the asp
and the basilisk, and tread upon the dragon and the lion. For this power
the Lord gave to His disciples, as He says in the Gospel: "Lo, I give
unto you power to tread on all the power of the enemy, and upon serpents
and scorpions; and they shall not harm
you."<sup>[19](footnote/fn106.htm#P10630_3347551.md)</sup> When, therefore,
these so many and such malignant spirits are attacking and bestirring
themselves for the destruction of the lapsed, a way of salvation is
provided for the wounded, that with whatever strength they have they may
drag themselves with their whole body, and betake themselves to their
camp, wherein being received, they may heal their wounds with spiritual
medicaments. Thus the dove received, after the intervention of a few
days, is again sent forth from the ark; and returning, not only shows
its firm footsteps, but moreover the signs of its peace and victory, in
those olive leaves which it bore in its mouth. Therefore that twofold
sending forth shows to us a twofold trial of persecution: the first, in
which they who have lapsed have fallen conquered; the second, in which
they who have fallen have come out conquerors. For to none of us is it
doubtful or uncertain, beloved brethren, that they who in the first
struggle-that is, in the Decian persecution-were wounded; afterwards,
that is in the second encounter, persevered so bravely, that, despising
the edicts of the princes of the
world,<sup>[20](footnote/fn106.htm#P10631_3348683.md)</sup> they maintained
that unconquered; in that they did not fear, after the example of the
good Shepherd, to give up their life, and to shed their blood, and not
to shrink from any barbarity of the raging tyrant.

7\. Behold how glorious, how dear to the Lord, are the people whom these
schismatics do not shrink from calling "wood, hay, stubble;
"<sup>[21](footnote/fn106.htm#P10633_3349067.md)</sup> the equals of whom,
that is, those who are even still placed in the same guilt of their
lapse, they presume must not be admitted to repentance. *This they
judge* from that utterance of the Lord, where He says, "Whosoever shall
deny me before men, him will I deny before my Father which is in
heaven."<sup>[22](footnote/fn106.htm#P10634_3349387.md)</sup> Oh grief! why
do they strive against the Lord's precepts, that this offspring of
Novatian, following the example of his father the devil, should now
endeavour to put in force those things which Christ will do in the time
of His judgment? *that is*, when Scripture says, "Vengeance is mine; and
I will repay, saith the
Lord."<sup>[23](footnote/fn106.htm#P10635_3349728.md)</sup>

8\. We will answer them *as to* that utterance of the Lord, which they
ill understand, and ill explain to themselves. For that He says,
"Whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my
Father which is in heaven," its meaning is assuredly with respect to
future time-to the time at which the Lord shall begin to judge the
secrets of men-to the time at which we must all stand before the
judgment-seat of Christ-to the time at which many shall begin to say,
"Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Thy name, and in Thy name cast
out devils, and in Thy name done many wonderful works?
"<sup>[24](footnote/fn106.htm#P10637_3350344.md)</sup> And yet *they* shall
hear the voice of the Lord saying, "Depart from me, all ye that have
worked iniquity: I know you
not."<sup>[25](footnote/fn106.htm#P10638_3350490.md)</sup> Then shall it be
fulfilled that He says, "I also will deny them." But whom will the Lord
Christ chiefly deny, if not all of you heretics, and schismatics, and
strangers to His name? For ye who were some time Christians, but now are
Novatians, no longer Christians, have changed your first faith by a
subsequent perfidy in the calling of your name. I should wish you to
reply to your own proposition. Read and teach: whom of those who had
failed or denied Him, while He was still with them, did our Lord deny?
Yet also to the others of the disciples who had remained with Him He
saith, "Will ye also go away?
"<sup>[26](footnote/fn106.htm#P10639_3351124.md)</sup> Even Peter, whom He
had previously foretold as about to deny Him, when he had denied Him, He
did not deny, but sustained; and He Himself soothed him when
subsequently bitterly bewailing his denial.

9\. What sort of folly is thine, Novatian, only to read what tends to
the destruction of salvation, and to pass by what tends to mercy, when
Scripture cries, and says, "Repent, ye who err: be converted in heart;
"<sup>[27](footnote/fn106.htm#P10641_3351552.md)</sup> and when the same
prophet also exhorts, and says, "Be converted unto me with all your
heart, in fasting, and weeping, and mourning; and rend your hearts, and
not your garments; be ye converted to the Lord your God: for He is
merciful, and one who pities with great compassion?
"<sup>[28](footnote/fn106.htm#P10642_3351854.md)</sup>

10\. Thus we have heard that the Lord is of great compassion. Let us
hear what the Holy Spirit testifies by David: "If his children forsake
my law, and walk not in my commandments; if they should profane my
righteousness, and should not keep my precepts; I will visit their
crimes with a rod, and their sins with stripes. But my mercy will I not
utterly disperse from
them."<sup>[29](footnote/fn106.htm#P10644_3352250.md)</sup> Words like to
these we read that the Lord said also by Ezekiel: "Son of man, the house
of Israel has dwelt on its own land, and they have defiled it by their
crimes: their uncleanness has become like that of a menstruous woman
before my face. I have poured out my anger upon them, and I have
scattered them among the nations; and I have judged them according to
their sins, because they have defiled my holy name; and because it was
said of them, "This is the people of the Lord, I have spared them,
because of my holy name, which the house of Israel despised among the
nations."<sup>[30](footnote/fn106.htm#P10645_3352858.md)</sup> And in
conjunction with this he says, "Therefore say to the people of Israel,
Thus saith the Lord, I spare you not, O house of Israel; but I will
spare you on account of my holy name, which ye have defiled among they
nations: and ye shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall be
sanctified in you." Also the Lord to the same: "Son of man, say unto the
people of Israel, Wherefore have ye spoken, saying, We are pining away
in our sins, and how shall we be able to be saved? Say unto them, I
live, saith the Lord: for I do not desire the death of the sinner; but I
desire that the sinner should turn from his evil way, and live:
therefore return ye from your evil way: why do ye give yourselves over
to death, O house of Israel?
"<sup>[31](footnote/fn106.htm#P10646_3353614.md)</sup> So, too, by Isaiah
the prophet: "I will not be angry with you for ever, nor will I abstain
from defending you
always."<sup>[32](footnote/fn106.htm#P10647_3353760.md)</sup> And because
Jeremiah the prophet, in the person of the sinful people, prays to the
Lord, saying, "Amend us, O Lord, but in judgment, and not in anger, lest
Thou make us few; "<sup>[33](footnote/fn106.htm#P10648_3353956.md)</sup>
Isaiah also added, and said, "For his sin I have slightly afflicted him;
and I have stricken him, and have turned away my face from him: and he
was afflicted, and went away sadly in his
ways."<sup>[34](footnote/fn106.htm#P10649_3354166.md)</sup> And because he
labours, he added and said, "I have seen his ways, and I have healed
him; and I have given him a true exhortation, peace upon peace;
"<sup>[35](footnote/fn106.htm#P10650_3354336.md)</sup> that to those who
repent, and pray, and labour, restoration is possible, because they
would miserably perish, and because they would decline from Christ.

11\. Moreover, this is proved in the Gospel, where is described that
woman who was a sinner, who came to the house of a certain Pharisee
whither the Lord had been bidden with His disciples, and she brought a
vessel of ointment, and stood at the Lord's feet, and washed His feet
with her tears, and wiped them with her hair, and pressed kisses upon
them; so that that Pharisee was provoked, and said, "If this man were a
prophet, he would know who and what sort of a woman this is who touches
him; for she is a
sinner."<sup>[36](footnote/fn106.htm#P10652_3355027.md)</sup> Whence
immediately the Lord, the remitter of sins and the receiver of the
penitent, says, "Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And he
answered, saying, Master, say on. And the Lord, There was a certain
creditor which had two debtors; one who
had<sup>[37](footnote/fn106.htm#P10653_3355304.md)</sup> five hundred
pence, and the other fifty. When they had nothing to pay, he forgave
both. And He asked, Which of these loved most? And Simon answered,
Assuredly he to whom he forgave most. And He added, saying, Seest thou
that woman? I entered into thy house, thou gavest me no kiss; but she
hath not ceased to kiss my feet; thou washedst not my feet, but she has
washed them with her tears, and wiped them with her hair; thou didst not
anoint my feet with oil, but she hath anointed them. Wherefore I say
unto thee, Simon, that her sins are forgiven her." Behold, the Lord
grants the debt with His liberal kindness to both debtors; behold Him
who pardons sins; behold the woman who was a sinner, penitent, weeping,
praying, and receiving remission of her sins!

12\. And now blush if thou canst, Novatian; cease to deceive the unwary
with thy impious arguments; cease to frighten them with the subtlety of
one particular. We read, and adore, and do not pass over the heavenly
judgment of the Lord, where he says that He will deny him who denies
Him. But does this mean the penitent? And why should I be taking pains
so long to prove individual cases of mercies? since the mercy of God is
not indeed denied to the Ninevites, although strangers, and placed apart
from the law of the Lord, when they beseech it on account of the
overthrow announced to their city. Nor to Pharaoh himself, resisting
with sacrilegious boldness, when formerly he was stricken with plagues
from heaven, and, turning to Moses and to his brother, said, "Pray to
the Lord for me, for I have
sinned."<sup>[38](footnote/fn106.htm#P10655_3356918.md)</sup> At once the
anger of God was suspended from him. And yet thou, O Novatian, judgest
and declarest that the lapsed have no hope of peace and mercy, nor
inclinest thine ear to the rebuke of the apostle, when he says," Who art
thou, who judgest another man's servant? To his own master he standeth
or falleth. Yea, he shall stand. God is mighty to establish
him."<sup>[39](footnote/fn106.htm#P10656_3357296.md)</sup> Whence
pertinently and needfully the Holy Spirit, in the person of those same
lapsed people, rebukes you when He says, "Rejoice not over me, O mine
enemy: because if I have fallen, I shall also rise again; and if I shall
walk in darkness, the Lord is my light. I will bear the indignation of
the Lord, because I have sinned against Him, until He justify my cause,
and execute judgment and justice, and bring me forth to the light. I
shall behold His righteousness; and she that is mine enemy shall see me,
and shall cover herself with
confusion."<sup>[40](footnote/fn106.htm#P10657_3357861.md)</sup>

13\. I beseech thee, hast thou not read, "Boast not, and speak not
loftily, and let not arrogancy proceed out of your mouth: for the Lord
lifteth the poor from the earth; He raiseth up the beggar from the
dunghill, and maketh him to sit with the mighty ones of the people?
"<sup>[41](footnote/fn106.htm#P10659_3358156.md)</sup> Hast thou not read,
that "the Lord resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble?
"<sup>[42](footnote/fn106.htm#P10660_3358267.md)</sup> Hast thou not read,
"Whoso exalteth himself shall be humbled?
"<sup>[43](footnote/fn106.htm#P10661_3358348.md)</sup> Hast thou not read,
that "God destroys the remembrance of the proud, and does not forsake
the memory of the lowly? "Hast thou not read, that "with what judgment a
man shall judge he must be judged?
"<sup>[44](footnote/fn106.htm#P10662_3358570.md)</sup> Hast thou not read,
that "he who hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh in darkness,
and knoweth not whither he goeth, because the darkness hath blinded his
eyes? "<sup>[45](footnote/fn106.htm#P10663_3358762.md)</sup> Whence, then,
this Novatian has become both so wicked and so lost, so mad with rage of
discord, I cannot discover, since he always in one household-that is,
the Church of Christ-would have bewailed the sins of his neighbours as
his own;<sup>[46](footnote/fn106.htm#P10664_3359019.md)</sup> would have
borne the burthens of his brethren, as the apostle exhorts would have
strengthened the faltering in the faith with heavenly counsel. But now,
from the time when he began to practise that heresy of Cain which only
delights in slaying, he does not even of late spare himself. But if he
had read that "the righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him
in the day on which he shall have erred, and the wickedness of the
wicked shall not harm him from the day in which he shall have been
converted,"<sup>[47](footnote/fn106.htm#P10665_3359641.md)</sup> he would
long ago have repented in ashes, who is always opposed to penitents; who
labours more readily in the destruction of those things which are built
and standing, than in the building up of those which are prostrate; who
has once more made heathens of many most wretched brethren of ours,
terrified by his false oppositions, by saying that the repentance of the
lapsed is vain, and cannot avail them for salvation, although the
Scripture cries aloud and says, "Remember whence thou hast fallen, and
repent, or else I will come to thee except thou
repent."<sup>[48](footnote/fn106.htm#P10666_3360225.md)</sup> And indeed,
writing to the seven churches, rebuking each one of them with its own
crimes and sins, it said, Repent. To whom but to them, doubtless, whom
He had redeemed at the great price of His blood?

14\. O impious and wicked as thou art, thou heretic Novatian! who after
so many and great crimes which in past times thou hadst known to be
voluntarily committed in the Church, and before thou thyself wast an
apostate in the family of God, hadst certainly taught that these might
be abolished from memory if well-doing followed; according to the faith
of the Scripture which says, "But if the wicked will turn from all his
sins which he hath committed, and will do righteousness, he shall live
in eternal life, and shall not die in his
wickedness."<sup>[49](footnote/fn106.htm#P10668_3360991.md)</sup> For the
sins which he has committed shall be abolished from memory by the good
deeds which succeed. Thou reconsiderest now, whether the wounds of the
lapsed who have fallen, stripped bare by the devil, ought to be cured;
*dashed down, as they are*, by the "violence of the flood which the
serpent sent forth from his mouth after the
woman."<sup>[50](footnote/fn106.htm#P10669_3361352.md)</sup> But "What
shall I say? "says the apostle. "Do I praise you? In this I praise you
not; that ye come together not for the better, but for the
worse."<sup>[51](footnote/fn106.htm#P10670_3361519.md)</sup> For where
there are "rivalries and dissensions among you, are ye not carnal, and
walk according to man?
"<sup>[52](footnote/fn106.htm#P10671_3361645.md)</sup> Nor indeed ought we
to wonder why this Novatian should dare now to practise such wicked,
such severe things against the person of the lapsed, since we have
previous examples of this kind of prevarication. Saul, that *once
good*<sup>[53](footnote/fn106.htm#P10672_3361891.md)</sup> man, besides
other things, is subsequently overthrown by envy, and strives to do
everything that is harsh and hostile against David. That Judas, who was
chosen among the apostles, who was always of one mind and faithful in
the house of God, himself subsequently betrayed
God.<sup>[54](footnote/fn106.htm#P10673_3362186.md)</sup>

And indeed the Lord had foretold that many should come as ravening
wolves in the skins of sheep. Who are those ravening wolves but such as
conspire with treacherous intent to waste the flock of Christ? As we
read it written in Zechariah: "Lo, I raise up a shepherd in the land,
who shall not visit that which is turned away, and will eat the flesh of
the chosen, and tear their claws in
pieces."<sup>[55](footnote/fn106.htm#P10675_3362681.md)</sup> Similarly
also in Ezekiel he rebukes shepherds of this kind, to wit, robbers and
butchers (I will speak as he had
thought<sup>[56](footnote/fn106.htm#P10676_3362822)</sup> .md), saying, "O
shepherds, wherefore do ye drink the milk, and eat up the curdled milk,
and have brought that which is strong to nothing, and have not visited
the weak, have not healed the halting, and have not recalled the
wandering, and have permitted my people to wander among thorns and
briers? For these things, says the Lord, lo, I will come against the
shepherds, and I will require my sheep of their hands; and I will drive
them away, that they may not feed my sheep; and my sheep shall no more
be for them to devour, and I will seek them out as a shepherd his flock
in the day in which there shall be darkness and cloud. Thus I will seek
out my sheep, and I will seek them out in every place wherever they are
scattered; and I will seek out what had perished, and I will recall what
had wandered, and what had halted I will heal, and what is weak I will
watch over; and I will feed my sheep with
judgment."<sup>[57](footnote/fn106.htm#P10677_3363869.md)</sup>

15\. Who is it that says these things? Certainly He who, having left the
ninety and nine sheep, went to seek that one which had wandered from His
flock; as David says, "I have gone astray like a sheep which was
lost,"<sup>[58](footnote/fn106.htm#P10679_3364104.md)</sup> which being
found Christ brings back, bearing on His shoulder the tender sinful one;
and He, rejoicing and exulting, having called His friends and domestics,
says, "Rejoice with me; for my sheep which was lost is found. I say,"
says He, "unto you, that there will be such joy in heaven over one
sinner that
repenteth."<sup>[59](footnote/fn106.htm#P10680_3364443.md)</sup> And in
continuation, He says: "Or what woman, having ten *denarii*, if she
should lose one of the *denarii*, does not light a lamp, and all the day
long clean out her house, seeking till she finds it? And when she has
found it, she calls together her friends and neighbours, saying, Rejoice
with me; for I have found the denarius that I had lost. I say unto you,
that such joy shall be in the sight of the angels of God over one sinner
that repenteth."<sup>[60](footnote/fn106.htm#P10681_3364912.md)</sup> But,
on the other hand, they who do not repent of their wickedness, let them
know from the answer of the Lord Himself what remaineth for them; for we
read in the Gospel, that "certain men came from the Galileans to the
Lord, telling Him of those whose blood Pilate mingled with their
sacrifices; to whom the Lord answered, saying, Think ye that those
Galileans had been sinners above other Galileans, because they suffered
such things? No; for I say unto you, unless ye repent, ye shall all
likewise perish. Or those eighteen upon whom the tower in Siloam fell,
think ye that they were debtors to death above all men who dwell in
Jerusalem? No; I say unto you," said He, "that unless ye repent, ye
shall all likewise
perish."<sup>[61](footnote/fn106.htm#P10682_3365658.md)</sup>

16\. Let us then arouse ourselves as much as we can, beloved brethren;
and breaking away from the slumber of indolence and security, let us be
watchful for the observance of the Lord's precepts. Let us with all our
hearts seek for what we have lost, that we may be able to find; because
"to him that seeketh," says the Scripture, "it shall be given, and to
him that knocketh it shall be
opened."<sup>[62](footnote/fn106.htm#P10684_3366074.md)</sup> Let us
cleanse our house with spiritual cleanliness, that every secret and
hidden place of our breast, truly enlightened by the light of the
Gospel, may say, "Against Thee only have I sinned, and done this great
evil in Thy sight."<sup>[63](footnote/fn106.htm#P10685_3366324.md)</sup>
Because the death of sinners is evil, and in hell there is no
repentance. Let us have in contemplation especially the day of judgment
and retribution, and what must be believed by all of us, and firmly
maintained, that "there is no acceptance of persons with God;
"<sup>[64](footnote/fn106.htm#P10686_3366606.md)</sup> since He commanded
in Deuteronomy, that the person must not be accepted in judgment: "Thou
shalt not accept," says He, "the person, neither shalt thou judge
according to the least nor according to the
greatest."<sup>[65](footnote/fn106.htm#P10687_3366836.md)</sup> Like words
to these He also said by Ezekiel: "All souls," said He, "are mine; as
the soul of the father, so is the soul of the son: the soul that hath
sinned, it shall die."<sup>[66](footnote/fn106.htm#P10688_3367028.md)</sup>
It is then He who must be revered by us; He must be held fast; He must
be propitiated by our full and worthy confession, "who has the power of
sending soul and body to the Gehenna of
fire,"<sup>[67](footnote/fn106.htm#P10689_3367239.md)</sup> -as it is
written, "Behold, He cometh with many thousands of His messengers, to
execute judgment upon all, and to destroy all the wicked, and to condemn
all flesh, for all the deeds of the wicked which they have wickedly
done. and for all the impious words which sinners have spoken about
God."<sup>[68](footnote/fn106.htm#P10690_3367552.md)</sup>

17\. Like things to these also says Daniel: "I beheld a throne placed,
and the Ancient of days sat upon it, and His clothing was as it were
snow, and the hairs of His head as it were white wool: His throne was a
flame of fire, its wheels were burning fire. A river of fire came forth
before Him: thousand thousands ministered to Him, and thousand thousands
stood before Him: He sat to judgment, and the books were
opened."<sup>[69](footnote/fn106.htm#P10692_3367993.md)</sup> And John
still more plainly declares, both about the day of judgment and the
consummation of the world, saying, "And when," said he, "He had opened
the sixth seal, lo, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became
black as sackcloth of hair, and the whole moon became as of blood; and
the stars fell to the earth, even as a fig-tree, shaken by a mighty
wind, casteth her unripe figs. And the heaven departed as a book when it
is rolled up, and every mountain and island were moved from their
places. And the kings of the earth, and all the great men, and the
tribunes, and the rich men, and the strong men, and every slave, and
every free man, hid themselves in the caves and in the caverns of the
mountains; saying to the mountains and to the rocks, Fall upon us, and
hide us from the sight of the Father that sitteth upon the throne, and
from the wrath of the Lamb: because the day of destruction cometh; and
who shall be able to stand?
"<sup>[70](footnote/fn106.htm#P10693_3368959.md)</sup> Also in the same
Apocalypse John says that this too was revealed to him. "I saw," says
he, "a great throne, and one in white who sat upon it, from whose face
the heaven and the earth fled away; and their place was not found. And I
saw the dead, great and small, standing before the sight of the Lord's
throne: and the books were opened; and another book was opened, which is
(the book) of life: and every one was judged according to those things
that were written in the book, according to their own
works."<sup>[71](footnote/fn106.htm#P10694_3369488.md)</sup> Moreover, too,
the apostle, giving good advice, thus exhorts us, saying, "Let no one
deceive you with vain words: for because of these things the wrath of
God cometh upon the children of disobedience. Be not partakers with
them."<sup>[72](footnote/fn106.htm#P10695_3369739.md)</sup>

18\. Let us, then, with the whole strength of our faith, give praise to
God; let us give our full confession, since the powers of heaven rejoice
over our repentance, all the angels rejoice, and Christ also rejoices,
who once again with full and merciful moderation exhorts us, laden with
sins, overwhelmed with crimes, to cease from wickedness, saying, "Turn
ye, and return from your impieties, and your iniquities shall not be to
you for a punishment. Cast away from you all your impieties which ye
have committed against me; and make to yourselves a new heart and a new
spirit. And why do ye deliver yourselves over to death, O house of
Israel? For I do not desire the death of the
sinner."<sup>[73](footnote/fn106.htm#P10697_3370450.md)</sup> "I am He, I
am He who blot out thy crimes, and I will not remember them. But do thou
have in mind, and let us judge; tell thou thy wickednesses first, that
thou mayest be
justified."<sup>[74](footnote/fn106.htm#P10698_3370658.md)</sup> While the
way of mercy, brethren, is
open,<sup>[75](footnote/fn106.htm#P10699_3370726.md)</sup> let us entreat
God with full atonements; let us humble ourselves, that we may be
exalted; let us acquiesce in the divine exhortation, whereby we may
escape the day of the Lord and His anger. For thus He says: "Look, my
son, upon the nations of men, and know who hath hoped in the Lord, and
has been confounded; or has remained in His commandments, and has been
forsaken; or has called upon Him, and He has despised him. For the Lord
is loving and merciful, and forgiving in time of tribulation their sins
to all those that seek after Him in
truth."<sup>[76](footnote/fn107.htm#P10700_3371639.md)</sup> Therefore He
says, "First tell thou thy sins, that thou mayest be justified." Let
there be first in your hand that prayer full of
confession.<sup>[77](footnote/fn107.htm#P10701_3371806.md)</sup>
