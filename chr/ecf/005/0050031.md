##  Epistle VI.<sup>[1](footnote/fn48.htm#P4824_1461150.md)</sup>

To Rogatianus the Presbyter, and the Other Confessors. a.d. 250.

1\. Cyprian to the presbyter Rogatianus, and to the other confessors,
his brethren, greeting. I had both heretofore, dearly beloved and
bravest brethren, sent you a letter, in which I congratulated your faith
and virtue with exulting words, and now my voice has no other object,
first of all, than with joyous mind, repeatedly and always to announce
the glory of your name. For what can I wish greater or better in my
prayers than to see the flock of Christ enlightened by the honour of
your confession? For although all the brethren ought to rejoice in this,
yet, in the common gladness, the share of the bishop is the greatest.
For the glory of the Church is the glory of the
bishop.<sup>[2](footnote/fn48.htm#P4829_1462247.md)</sup> In proportion as
we grieve over those whom a hostile persecution has cast down, in the
same proportion we rejoice over you whom the devil has not been able to
over-Conic.

2\. Yet I exhort you by our common faith, by the true and simple love of
my heart towards you, that, having overcome the adversary in this first
encounter, you should hold fast your glory with a brave and persevering
virtue. We are still in the world; we are still placed in the
battle-field; we fight daily for our lives. Care must be taken, that
after such beginnings as these there should also come an increase, and
that what you have begun to be with such a blessed commencement should
be consummated in you. It is a slight thing to have been able to attain
anything; it is more to be able to keep what you have attained; even as
faith itself and saving birth makes alive, not by being received, but by
being preserved. Nor is it actually the attainment, but the perfecting,
that keeps a man for God. The Lord taught this in His instruction when
He said, "Behold, thou art made whole; sin no more, lest a worse thing
come unto thee."<sup>[3](footnote/fn48.htm#P4831_1463410.md)</sup> Conceive
of Him as saying this also to His confessor, "Lo thou art made a
confessor; sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee." Solomon
also, and Saul, and many others, so long as they walked in the Lord's
ways, were able to keep the grace given to them. When the discipline of
the Lord was forsaken by them, grace also forsook them.

3\. We must persevere in the straight and narrow road of praise and
glory; and since peacefulness and humility and the tranquillity of a
good life is fitting for all Christians, according to the word of the
Lord, who looks to none other man than "to him that is poor and of a
contrite spirit, and that trembleth
at"<sup>[4](footnote/fn48.htm#P4833_1464078.md)</sup> His word, it the more
behoves you confessors, who have been made an example to the rest of the
brethren, to observe and fulfil this, as being those whose characters
should provoke to imitation the life and conduct of all. For as the Jews
were alienated from God, as those on whose account "the name of God is
blasphemed among the
Gentiles,"<sup>[5](footnote/fn48.htm#P4834_1464436.md)</sup> so on the
other hand those are dear to God through whose conformity to discipline
the name of God is declared with a testimony of praise, as it is
written, the Lord Himself forewarning and saying, "Let your light so
shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your
Father which is in
heaven."<sup>[6](footnote/fn48.htm#P4835_1464764.md)</sup> And Paul the
apostle says, "Shine as lights in the
world."<sup>[7](footnote/fn48.htm#P4836_1464839.md)</sup> And similarly
Peter exhorts: "As strangers," says he, "and pilgrims, abstain from
fleshly lusts, which war against the soul, having your conversation
honest among the Gentiles; that whereas they speak against you as
evil-doers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold,
glorify the Lord."<sup>[8](footnote/fn48.htm#P4837_1465157.md)</sup> This,
indeed, the greatest part of you, I rejoice to say, are careful for;
and, made better by the honour of your confession itself, guard and
preserve its glory by tranquil and virtuous lives.

4\. But I hear that some infect your number, and destroy the praise of a
distinguished name by their corrupt conversation; whom you yourselves,
even as being lovers and guardians of your own praise, should rebuke and
check and correct. For what a disgrace is suffered by your name, when
one spends his days in intoxication and
debauchery,<sup>[9](footnote/fn48.htm#P4839_1465710.md)</sup> another
returns to that country whence he was banished, to perish when arrested,
not now as being a Christian, but as being a
criminal!<sup>[10](footnote/fn48.htm#P4840_1465940.md)</sup> I hear that
some are puffed up and are arrogant, although it is written, "Be not
high-minded, but fear: for if God spared not the natural branches, take
heed lest He also spare not
thee."<sup>[11](footnote/fn48.htm#P4841_1466382.md)</sup> Our Lord "was led
as a sheep to the slaughter; and as a lamb before her shearers is dumb,
so He opened not His
mouth."<sup>[12](footnote/fn48.htm#P4842_1466563.md)</sup> "I am not
rebellious," says He, "neither do I gainsay. I gave my back to the
smiters, and my cheeks to the palms of their hands. I hid not my face
from the filthiness of
spitting."<sup>[13](footnote/fn48.htm#P4843_1466763.md)</sup> And dares any
one now, who lives by and in this very One, lift up himself and be
haughty, forgetful, as well of the deeds which He did, as of the
commands which He left to us either by Himself or by His apostles? But
if "the servant is not greater than his
Lord."<sup>[14](footnote/fn48.htm#P4844_1467046.md)</sup> let those who
follow the Lord humbly and peacefully and silently tread in His steps,
since the lower one is, the more exalted be may become; as says the
Lord, "He that is least among you, the same shall be
great."<sup>[15](footnote/fn48.htm#P4845_1467281.md)</sup>

5\. What, then, is that-how execrable should it appear to you-which I
have learnt with extreme anguish and grief of mind, to wit, that there
are not wanting those who defile the temples of God, and the members
sanctified after confession and made
glorious,<sup>[16](footnote/fn48.htm#P4847_1467555.md)</sup> with a
disgraceful and infamous concubinage, associating their beds
promiscuously with women's! In which, even if there be no pollution of
their conscience, there is a great guilt in this very thing, that by
their offence originate examples for the ruin of
Others.<sup>[17](footnote/fn48.htm#P4848_1467886.md)</sup> There ought also
to be no contentions and emulations among you, since the Lord left to us
His peace, and it is written, "Thou shall love thy neighbour as
thyself."<sup>[18](footnote/fn48.htm#P4849_1468160.md)</sup> "But if ye
bite and find fault with one another, take heed that ye be not consumed
one of another."<sup>[19](footnote/fn48.htm#P4850_1468279.md)</sup> From
abuse and revilings also I entreat you to abstain, for "revilers do not
attain the kingdom of God;
"<sup>[20](footnote/fn48.htm#P4851_1468406.md)</sup> and the tongue which
has confessed Christ should be preserved sound and pure with its honour.
For he who, according to Christ's precept, speaks things peaceable and
good and just, daily confesses Christ. We had renounced the world when
we were baptized; but we have now indeed renounced the world when tried
and approved by God, we leave all that we have, and have followed the
Lord, and stand and live in His faith and fear.

6\. Let us confirm one another by mutual exhortations, and let us more
and more go forward in the Lord; so that when of His mercy He shall have
made that peace which He promises to give, we may return to the Church
new and almost changed men, and may be received, whether by our brethren
or by the heathen, in all things corrected and renewed for the better;
and those who formerly admired our glory in our courage may now admire
the discipline in our
lives.<sup>[21](footnote/fn48.htm#P4853_1469327.md)</sup> I bid you,
beloved brethren, ever heartily farewell; and be mindful of me.
