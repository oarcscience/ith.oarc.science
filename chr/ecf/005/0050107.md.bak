##  Epistle LXXXII.<sup>[1](footnote/fn66.htm#P6641_2146527.md)</sup>

To the Clergy and People Concerning His Retirement, a Little Before His
Martyrdom.

1\. Cyprian to the presbyters and deacons, and all the people, greeting.
When it had been told to us, dearest brethren, that the
gaolers<sup>[2](footnote/fn66.htm#P6646_2147405.md)</sup> had been sent to
bring me to Utica, and I had been persuaded by the counsel of those
dearest to me to withdraw for a time from my gardens, as a just reason
was afforded I consented. For the reason that it is fit for a bishop, in
that city in which he presides over the Church of the Lord, there to
confess the Lord, and that the whole people should be glorified by the
confession of their prelate in their presence. For whatever, in that
moment of confession, the confessor-bishop speaks, he speaks in the
mouth of all, by inspiration of
God.<sup>[3](footnote/fn66.htm#P6647_2147972.md)</sup> But the honour of
our Church, glorious as it is, will be mutilated if I, a bishop placed
over another church, receiving my sentence or my confession at Utica,
should go thence as a martyr to the Lord, when indeed, both for my own
sake and yours, I pray with continual supplications, and with all my
desires entreat, that I may confess among you, and there suffer, and
thence depart to the Lord even as I ought. Therefore here in a hidden
retreat I await the arrival of the proconsul returning to Carthage, that
I may hear from him what the emperors have commanded upon the subject of
Christian laymen and bishops, and may say what the Lord will wish to be
said at that hour.

2\. But do you, dearest brethren, according to the discipline which you
have ever received from me out of the Lord's commands, and according to
what you have so very often learnt from my discourse, keep peace and
tranquillity; nor let any of you stir up any tumult for the brethren, or
voluntarily offer himself to the Gentiles. For when apprehended and
delivered up, he ought to speak, inasmuch as the Lord abiding in us
speaks in that hour, who willed that we should rather confess than
profess. But for the rest, what it is fitting that we should observe
before the proconsul passes sentence on me for the confession of the
name of God, we will with the instruction of the Lord arrange in
common.<sup>[4](footnote/fn66.htm#P6649_2149482.md)</sup> May our Lord make
you, dearest brethren, to remain safe in His Church, and condescend to
keep you. So be it through His mercy.
