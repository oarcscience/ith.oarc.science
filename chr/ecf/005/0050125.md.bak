##  Elucidation.

(To them we have succeeded, p. 572)

The theory of Cyprian is thus recognised in full council, by his
colleagues, with respect to the unity of the Church Catholic. They have
never heard of any counter theory, and they state it as a matter of
course. Fortunatus of "Tuccaboris" had shortly before referred to the
Church as "built upon a *rock*," with evident reference to *the faith*,
for he adds, "not upon *heresy*." Of a perpetuated *construction*, of
which any one bishop was the perpetuated *foundation*, nobody as yet
seems to have dreamed. "Other *foundation* can no man lay than that is
laid," says St. Paul; viz., "Christ." On Him, "the Stone, Elect,
precious," St. Peter and all the apostles (the prophets as well) are
built as foundation-stones; and we also, as "lively stones," are built
upon that foundation,<sup>[142](footnote/fn96.htm#P9639_2974306.md)</sup>
into a holy temple.

This Council of Carthage sustains Cyprian also in his judgment
concerning the question of baptism, and it is a mistake to say that it
was ever overruled. Compare St. Basil, *Ad Amphilochium* (*Epist.
Canonica prima*, p. 19, vol. iii., ed. Paris, 1638), where he refers to
Cyprian and Firmilian ("*our* Firmilian") as "ancient men," and treats
the question as still an open one.

Translator's Introduction to Treatises Attributed to Cyprian on
Questionable Authority.

The treatises which follow are usually classed under the doubtful works
of Cyprian. Baluzius, however, gives the two first, *On the Public
Shows*, and *On the Glory of Martyrdom*, among the genuine *Opuscula*,
and says: "I have not thought it fit to prejudice any one amid the
diversity of opinions on the subject, but have refrained from separating
the following from the genuine works of the blessed martyr, especially
since many have observed that there is no such difference of style in
these writings as to justify the denial of their authorship to Cyprian."

Of course the question is one almost entirely of criticism, and the
translator leaves the discussion of it to abler hands. He ventures,
however, to record his impression, that the style of the following
writings throughout is more pretentious and laboured, and far more wordy
and involved, than that of Cyprian's undoubted works. With a more
copious vocabulary, there is manifested less skill in the use of words;
and if the text be not in some places most elaborately and
unintelligibly corrupt, the accumulation of epithets, as well as their
collocation, seems the very wantonness of rhetoric. The text, however,
is undoubtedly far less to be depended upon than in the case of the
genuine works.

The treatises *On the Discipline and Benefit of Chastity* and the
*Exhortation to Repentance* are generally placed under the *Opuscula
dubia*. The former was first edited by Baluzius, with the title "Epistle
of an Unknown Author." Its Cyprianic authorship was maintained by
Bellarmin, Pamelius, and others; while Erasmus, Tillemont, and others
have rejected it as spurious. The second treatise was first published by
Joannes Chrysostomus Trombellius (in 1751), who regarded it as a genuine
work of Cyprian's. And indeed, as far as internal evidence goes, the
treatise, consisting merely of a collection of quotations from
Scripture, in the manner of the *Testimonies against the Jews*, may
probably be attributed to him with as much reason as the *Testimonies*.

It is, however, right to add, that Professor Blunt quotes from the
*Treatise on the Glory of Martyrdom* as being Cyprian's, without
referring to any doubts on the
subject.<sup>[143](footnote/fn96.htm#P9647_2977039.md)</sup>
