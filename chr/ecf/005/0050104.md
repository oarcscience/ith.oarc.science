##  Epistle LXXIX.<sup>[1](footnote/fn65.md)</sup>

the Answer of Felix, Jader, Polianus, and the Rest of the Martyrs, to
Cyprian.

To our dearest and best beloved Cyprian, Felix, Jader, Polianus,
together with the presbyters and all who are abiding with us at the mine
of Sigua, eternal health in the Lord. We reply to your salutation,
dearest brother, by Herennianus the sub-deacon, Lucian and Maximus our
brethren, strong and safe by the aid of your prayers, from whom we have
received a sum under the name of an offering, together with your letter
which you wrote, and in which you have condescended to comfort us as if
we were sons, out of the heavenly words. And we have given and do give
thanks to God the Father Almighty through His Christ, that we have been
thus comforted and strengthened by your address, asking from the candour
of your mind that you would deign to have us in mind in your constant
prayers, that the Lord would supply what is wanting in your confession
and ours, which He has condescended to confer on us. Greet all who abide
with you. We bid you, dearest brother, ever heartily farewell in God. I
Felix wrote this; I Jader subscribed it; I Polianus read it. I greet my
lord Eutychianus.
