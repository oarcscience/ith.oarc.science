<SUP>7 </SUP>This is a very obscure passage, and is variously understood. It seems most probable that the allusion is to Peter's denial of his Lord, and following Him afar off; and is intended to bear upon Cyprian's retirement. There seems no meaning in interpreting the passage a. a reference to Peter's death. [It seems. in a slight degree, to reflect on Cyprian's withdrawal. But note, it asserts that the <I>pasce oves meas</I>was a reproach to St. Peter, and was understood to be so by his fellow-apostles. In other words, our Lord, so these clergy argue, bade St. Peter not again to forsake the brethren whom he should strengthen. Luke xxii. 32.] </P>
