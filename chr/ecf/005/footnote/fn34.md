Theophilus whom Methodius, a contemporary of Hippolytus, addresses as
Epiphanius. \[See vol. vi., this series.\] From his introduction, too,
it is clear that they are in error who take this book to be a homily.

<span id="P3421_1068157"></span> <sup>3</sup> In the text the reading is
twn ontwn, for which twn wtwn = *of the ears*, is proposed by some, and
anqrwpwn = *of men*, by others. In the manuscripts the abbreviation anwn
is often found for anqrwpwn.

<span id="P3422_1068706"></span> <sup>4</sup> In the text we find wj
piwn kaqara gh, for which grammar requires wj pioni kaqara gh.
Combefisius proposes wsper oun kaqara gh = *as in clean ground*. Others
would read wj puron, etc., = *like a grain in clean ground*.

<span id="P3424_1069716"></span> <sup>6</sup> This reading, paraklhsewn
for marturwn (= witnesses), which is peculiar to Hippolytus alone, is
all the more remarkable as so thoroughly suiting Paul's meaning in the
passage.

<span id="P3428_1070434"></span> <sup>9</sup> The text reads atina =

<span id="P3429_1070964"></span> <sup>10</sup> The plectrum was the
instrument with which the lyre was struck. The text is in confusion
here. Combefisius corrects it, as we render it, ooganwn dikhn hnwmenon

<span id="P3431_1071324"></span> <sup>12</sup> The text reads mh planw

<span id="P3432_1071686"></span> <sup>13</sup> This is according to the
emendation of Combefisius. \[And note this primitive theory of

<span id="P3433_1072327"></span> <sup>14</sup> 1 Sam. ix. 9.

<span id="P3434_1072834"></span> <sup>15</sup> In the text it is

proposes, as in our rendering, proeirhmena.

and nexus of the personal unity.

<span id="P3464_1082010"></span> <sup>36</sup> The text gives simply,
thn tou agiou. etc., = the *paternal voice of the Holy Ghost*, etc. As
this would seem to represent the Holy Ghost as the Father of Christ,
Combefisius proposes, as in our rendering, kata thn dia tou agiou, etc.
The *wine*, therefore, is taken as a figure of His *deity*, and the
garment as a figure of His *humanity*; and the sense would be, that He
has the latter imbued with the former in a way peculiar to Himself-even
as the voice at the Jordan declared Him to be the Father's Son, not His
Son by adoption, but His *own* Son, anointed as man with divinity
itself.

<span id="P3465_1082922"></span> <sup>37</sup> The nations are compared

"between the teeth of it; and they said thus to it, Arise, devour much
flesh."

<span id="P3493_1093075"></span> <sup>56</sup> Combefisius inserted
these words, because he thought that they must have been in the vision,
