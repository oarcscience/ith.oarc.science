Cleopatra, wife and niece of Physco. For Lathyrus was sometimes called
Philometor in ridicule (epi xleuasma), as Pausanias says in the
*Attica*.

<span id="P3017_967451"></span> <sup>191</sup> He refers to Alexander I.
king of Syria, of whom we read in 1 Macc. x. He pretended to be the son
of Antiochus Epiphanes, and even gained a decree of the senate of Rome
in his favour as such. Yet he was a person of unknown origin, as indeed
he acknowledged himself in his choice of the designation *Theopator*.
Livy calls him "a man unknown, and of uncertain parentage" (*homo
ignotus et incertae stirpis*). So Hippolytus calls him here, "a certain
Alexander" (tina).He had also other surnames, e.g., Euergetes, Balas,
etc.
