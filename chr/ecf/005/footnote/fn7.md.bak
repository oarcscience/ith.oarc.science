<span id="P706_173604"></span> <sup>87</sup> Hippolytus, having exposed
the system of sidereal influence over men, proceeds to detail the
magical rites and operations of the sorcerers. This arrangement is in
conformity with the technical divisions of astrology into (1) judiciary,
(2) natural. The former related to the prediction of future events, and
the latter of the phenomena of nature, being thus akin to the art of
magic.

<span id="P708_174125"></span> <sup>88</sup> The text here and at the
end of the last chapter is somewhat imperfect.

<span id="P709_175325"></span> <sup>89</sup> Or "cushion" (Cruice), or
"couch," or "a recess."

<span id="P710_175577"></span> <sup>90</sup> Or "goes up," or
"commences," or "enters in before the others, bearing the oblation"
(Cruice).

<span id="P711_176802"></span> <sup>91</sup> Or, "deride."

<span id="P713_177976"></span> <sup>92</sup> The Abbe Cruice considers
that this passage, as attributing all this jugglery to the artifice of
sorcerers, militates against the authorship of Origen, who ascribes (
Heri Arxwn, lib. iii. p. 144, ed. Benedict.) the same results not to the
frauds of magicians, but to demons.

<span id="P715_179668"></span> <sup>93</sup> Or, "denominated."

<span id="P716_180319"></span> <sup>94</sup> Or, "rises up."

<span id="P717_181252"></span> <sup>95</sup> On the margin of the MS.,
we find the words, "concerning coals," "concerning magical signs,"
"concerning sheep."

<span id="P724_182043"></span> <sup>96</sup> Or, paradoqeij, "he
delivers it a sword, and departs."

<span id="P728_182749"></span> <sup>97</sup> Or, "close up."

<span id="P729_183021"></span> <sup>98</sup> The words "death of a goat"
occur on the margin of the MS.

<span id="P730_183114"></span> <sup>99</sup> A similar statement is
made, on the authority of Alcmaeon, by Aristotle in his *Histor.
Animal.*, i. 2.

<span id="P731_183759"></span> <sup>100</sup> Mannh is the word in the
text. But manna in the ordinary acceptation of the tenn can scarcely be
intended. Pliny, however, mentions it as a proper name of grains of
incense and resin. The Abbe Cruice suggests the very probable emendation
of malqh, which signifies a mixture of wax and resin for caulking ships.

<span id="P741_185811"></span> <sup>101</sup> diaulon in the text has
been altered into kelanon. The trans- \~ lator has followed the latter.

<span id="P744_186004"></span> <sup>102</sup> Or "indissoluble," or
"inseparable."

<span id="P752_186378"></span> <sup>103</sup> Marsilius Ficinus (in his
*Commentary on Plotinrus*, p. 504 et sec., vol. ii. Creuzer's edition),
who here discusses the subject of demons and magical art, mentions, on
the authority of Porphyry, that sorcerers had the power of evoking
demons, and that a magician, in the presience of many, had shown to
Plotinus his guardian demon (angel). This constitutes the Goetic
department of magic.

<span id="P753_187201"></span> <sup>104</sup> Or, "full of pitch."

<span id="P754_187849"></span> <sup>105</sup> Mursinh This word is
evidently not the right one, for we have ( smurnh) myrrh mentioned.
Perhaps the word malqh, suggested in a previous passage, is the one
employed here likewise.

<span id="P756_188865"></span> <sup>106</sup> Or, "makes speedy
preparation;" or, "resorts to the contrivance of."

<span id="P757_189059"></span> <sup>107</sup> The words in italics are
added by the Abbe Cruice. There is obviously some hiatus in the
original.

<span id="P758_189178"></span> <sup>108</sup> Or, "the refuse of."

<span id="P762_190063"></span> <sup>109</sup> In the margin of the MS.
occur the words, "concerning the brealking of the seals."

<span id="P763_190312"></span> <sup>110</sup> Or, "exposed their method
of proceeding in accordance with the system of Gnosticism." Schneidewin,
following C. Fr. Hermann, is of opinion that what follows is taken from
Celsus' work on magic, to which Origen alludes in the *Contra Celsum*,
lib. i. p.53 (Spencer's edition). Lucian (the well-known satirist), in
his *Alexander*, or *Pseudomiantis*, gives an account of the jugglery of
these magicians. See: note, chap. xlii. of this book.

<span id="P764_191810"></span> <sup>111</sup> Or, "ground"-forukthj,(
*al*.) frukthj, ( *al*.) frukthj, ( *al*.) frukthj.

<span id="P766_192275"></span> <sup>112</sup> Or, "insert."

<span id="P767_192955"></span> <sup>113</sup> Or "taught," or "adduced,"
or "delivered."

<span id="P768_193157"></span> <sup>114</sup> This sentence is obviously
out of place, and should properly come in probably before the words,
"These contrivances, however, I hesitated to narrate," etc., a few lines
above in this chapter. The Abbe Cruice conjectures that it may have been
written on the margin by some reader acquainted with chemistry, and
thatafterwards it found its way into the text.

<span id="P772_193853"></span> <sup>115</sup> Some read faneron for
paron.

<span id="P773_193931"></span> <sup>116</sup> What cyanus was is not
exactly known. It was employed in the Homeric age for the adornment of
implements of war. Whatever the nature of the substance be, it was of a
dark-blue colour. Some suppose it to have been blue steel, other, blue
copper. Theophrastus' account of it makes it a stone like a dark
sapphire.

<span id="P774_194617"></span> <sup>117</sup> Or, "with the head
downwards."

<span id="P775_195200"></span> <sup>118</sup> There is some hiatus here.

<span id="P783_196315"></span> <sup>119</sup> Or, "menmory."

<span id="P791_197839"></span> <sup>120</sup> Or, "suspending a drum,
etc., covered with," etc.; or "frequently placing on an elevated
position a drum." For porrwqen, which is not here easy of explanation,
some read tornwqen, others !porpwqen, i.e, fastened with buckles;
others, porrw teqen.

<span id="P792_198576"></span> <sup>121</sup> Schneidewin, but not the
Abbe Cruice, thinks there is a hiatus here.

<span id="P793_198708"></span> <sup>122</sup> There are diferent
readings: (1) etumololikhj; (2) eti oloklhrou; (3) ualourgikhj, i e.,
composed of glass. (See next note.)

<span id="P795_199226"></span> <sup>123</sup> The Abbe Cruice properly
remarks that this has no meaning here. He would read ualwdesi topoij, or
by means of glass images.
