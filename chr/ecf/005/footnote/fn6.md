<span id="P604_142246"></span> <sup>44</sup> The Abbe Cruice thinks that
the word should be "tones," supporting his emendation on the authority
of Pliny, who states that Pythagoras called the distance of the Moon
from the Earth a tone, deriving the term from musical science (see
Pliny's *Hist. Nat*., ii. 20).

<span id="P605_142594"></span> <sup>45</sup> These numerical
speculations are treated of by Archimedes in his work *On the Number of
the Sand*, in which he maintains the possibility of counting the sands,
even on the supposition of the world's being much larger than it is (see
Archimedes, ta mexri nun swzomena apanta, Treatise yammithj, p. 120, ed.
Eustoc. Ascalon., Basil, 1544).

<span id="P616_148243"></span> <sup>46</sup> Colarbasus is afterwards
mentioned in company with Marcus the heretic, at the beginning and end
of book vi of *The Refutation*.

<span id="P617_148657"></span> <sup>47</sup> This word ( sleoiazousi),
more than once used by Hippolytus, is applied to anything done offhand,
e.g., an *extempore* speech. It therefore might be made to designate
immaturity of opinion. Sxediameans something hastily put together, viz.,
a raft; sxeoioj, sudden.

<span id="P618_149016"></span> <sup>48</sup> Schneidewin suggests omwj
instead of oimoiwj. The word ( ehanisamenoi) translated "appropriating"
is derived from eranoj, which signifies a meal to which those who
partake of it have each contributed some dish (pic-nic). The term,
therefore, is an expressive one for Hippolytus' purpose.

<span id="P619_149420"></span> <sup>49</sup> proynwstikouj. Some would
read proj ynwstkouj.

<span id="P620_149836"></span> <sup>50</sup> Some propose dochj.
"opinion." Hippolytus, however, used the word oizhj (translated
"school") in a similar way at the end of chap. i. of book iv. "Novelty"
is read instead of "knavery;" and for anapleou, "full," is proposed (1)
anapleontaj, (a) anapterountaj.

<span id="P624_150439"></span> <sup>51</sup> The subject of the
numerical system employed by the Gnostics, and their occult mysteries,
is treated of by the learned Kircher, *Aedipi Aegypt.*., tom. ii. part
i, *de Cabala Hebraeorum*; also in his *Arithmolog*. in the book *De
Arithmomantiaa Gnosticor*., cap. viii., *de Cabala Pythagorea*. See also
Mersennes, *Comment. on Genes*.

<span id="P626_153176"></span> <sup>52</sup> This subject is examined by
Cornelius Agrippa in his celebrated work, *De vanitate et incertitudine
Scientiarum*, chap. xi., *De Sorte Pythagoriea*. Terentiuc Maurus has
also a versified work on *Letters and Syllables and Metres*, in which he
alludes to similar interpretations educible from the names Hector and
Patroclus.

<span id="P628_154255"></span> <sup>53</sup> - That is, the division by
nine.

<span id="P629_154962"></span> <sup>54</sup> That is, calculated
according to the rule of a division by seven.

<span id="P630_155598"></span> <sup>55</sup> We should expect rather
five instead of 9, if the division be by nine.

<span id="P631_156174"></span> <sup>56</sup> There is some confusion in
the text. Miller conjectures that the reading should be: "As, for
instance, the name Patroclus has the letter *o* occurring twice in it,
they therefore take it into calculation once." Schneidewin suggests that
the form of the name may be Papatroclus.

<span id="P633_158734"></span> <sup>57</sup> Miller says there is an
error in the calculation here.

<span id="P634_158873"></span> <sup>58</sup> This is as near the sense
of the passage as a translation in some respects conjectural can make
it.

<span id="P639_160872"></span> <sup>59</sup> The word qelein occurs in
this sentence, but is obviously superfluous.

<span id="P641_161864"></span> <sup>60</sup> In the margin of the Ms. is
the note, "Opinion of the Metopiscopists."

<span id="P642_162101"></span> <sup>61</sup> These words are out of
place. See next note.

<span id="P643_162303"></span> <sup>62</sup> There is evidently some
displacement of words here. Miller and Schneidewin suggest: "There are
some who ascribe to the influence of the stars the natures of men:
since, in computing the births of individuals, they thus express
themselves as if they were moulding the species of men." The Abbe Cruice
would leave the text as it is, altering only tupountej ideaj into tupwn
te ideaj.

<span id="P644_162824"></span> <sup>63</sup> Literally, "jumping; "
others read "blackish," or "expressive" (literally, "talking"). The
vulgar reading, upo alloij, is evidently untenable.

<span id="P645_163140"></span> <sup>64</sup> Or "cowardly," or "cowards
at heart;" or some read, laropoioi, i.e., "causative of gl"

<span id="P646_163529"></span> <sup>65</sup> Or, "diseased with
unnatural lust," i.e., nosountej for noountej.

<span id="P647_163737"></span> <sup>66</sup> Or, kat epoj, "verbally
rejecting anything."

<span id="P651_164279"></span> <sup>67</sup> Or better, "weak in the
limbs."

<span id="P652_164633"></span> <sup>68</sup> Or, "short."

<span id="P656_164933"></span> <sup>69</sup> Or, "parts."

<span id="P657_165007"></span> <sup>70</sup> Some read kalw
yeyennhmenwn/, or kalw tetennhmenwn.

<span id="P658_165174"></span> <sup>71</sup> Or, "they are given to
hoarding, they have possessions."

<span id="P659_165350"></span> <sup>72</sup> This is an amended reading
of the text, which is obviously confused. The correction necessary is
introduced lower down in the MS., which makes the same characteristic be
twice mentioned. The Abbe Cruice, however, accounts for such a twofold
mention, on the ground that the whole subject is treated by Hippolytus
in such a way as to expose the absurdities of the astrologic
predictions. He therefore quotes the opinions of various astrologers, in
order to expose the diversities of opinion existing among them.

<span id="P663_166716"></span> <sup>73</sup> Manilius maintains that
persons born under Cancer are of an avaricious and usurious disposition.
(See *Astronom*., iv. 5.)

<span id="P667_167148"></span> <sup>74</sup> Or, "having the upper parts
larger than the lower."

<span id="P668_167431"></span> <sup>75</sup> Some read analoi.

<span id="P669_167509"></span> <sup>76</sup> Schneidewin conjectures
asunhqeij, i.e., inexperienced.

<span id="P670_167759"></span> <sup>77</sup> Or, "succour."

<span id="P674_167944"></span> <sup>78</sup> Or, "straight, compact."

<span id="P675_168040"></span> <sup>79</sup> Miller gives an additional
sentence: "They are of equal measurement at tbe (same) age, and possess
a body perfect and erect."

<span id="P676_168398"></span> <sup>80</sup> Or, "careful observers."

<span id="P680_169119"></span> <sup>81</sup> Or, "speaking falsehoods,
they will be believed."

<span id="P681_169408"></span> <sup>82</sup> The parenthetical words are
obviously an interpolation.

<span id="P682_169509"></span> <sup>83</sup> Or, "spies."

<span id="P692_170833"></span> <sup>84</sup> Or, "body."

<span id="P696_171621"></span> <sup>85</sup> Literally "moist," or
"difficult;" or, the Abbe Cruice suggests, "fortuitous."

<span id="P697_171845"></span> <sup>86</sup> Or, "pragmatic, mild, not
violent."
