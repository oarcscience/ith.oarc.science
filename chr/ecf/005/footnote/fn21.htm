<SUP>39 </SUP>They were therefore called "Quartodecimans." (See Eucebius, <I>Hist. Ecclesiast</I>., v. c. xxii. xxv.; Epiphanius, <I>Haer</I>., l.; and Theodoret, fleer. <I>Haer. Fab</I>., iii. 4.)</P>

<SUP>40 </SUP>[Bunsen, i. p. 105.] The chapter on the Quartodecimans agrees with the arguments which, we are informed in an extract from Hippolytus' <I>Chronicon Paschalea</I>, as preserved in a quotation by Bishop Peter of Alexandria, were employed in his <I>Treatis against all Heresies</I>. This would seem irrefragable proof of the authorship of the <I>Refutation of all Heresies</I>.</P>

<SUP>43 </SUP>These heretics had several denominations: (I) Phrygians and Cataphrygians, from Phrygia; (2) Pepuzian, from a villiage in Phrygia of this name; (3) Priscillianists; (4) Quintillists See Esebius, <I>Hist. Ecclesiast</I>., iv, 27, v. 16, 18; Epiphanius, <I>Haer</I>., xliii.; Theodoret, <I>Haer. Fab</I>., iii. 2; Philastrius, xlix.; and St. Augustine, <I>Haer</I>., xxvi. [The "Tertullianists" were a class by themselves, which is a fact going far to encourage the idea that they did not share the worst of these delusions.]</P>

<P><A NAME="P2117_662213"></A>
<SUP>44 </SUP>Bunsen thinks that Hippolytus is rather meagre in his details of the heresy of the Phrygians or Montanists, but considers this, with other instances, a proof that parts of <I>The Refutation</I>are only abstracts of more extended accounts. </P>

<SUP>47 </SUP>[This, Tertullian should have learned.

<SUP>49 </SUP>The Ophites are not considered, as Hippolytus has already devoted so much of his work to the Naasseni. The former denomination is derived from the Greek, and the latter from the Hebrew, and both signify worshippers of the serpent.</P>

<P><A NAME="P2126_665690"></A>
<SUP>50 </SUP>Hippolytus seemingly makes this a synonyme with Ophites. Perhaps it is connected with the Hebrew word <FONT FACE='SPTiberian'>#$hg</FONT></P>

<SUP>16 </SUP>This addition seems necessary from Stobaeus' account of Heraclitus. (See <I>Eclog. Phys</I>., i. 47, where we have Heraclitus affirming that "unity is from plurality, and plurality from unity;" or, in other words, "that all things are one.")</P>

There is some difficulty in arriving at the correct text, and consequently at the meaning of Hippolytus' extracts from Heraclitus. The Heraclitean philosophy is explained by Stobaeus, already mentioned. See likewise Bernays' "Critical Epistle" in Bunsen's <I>Analect.
