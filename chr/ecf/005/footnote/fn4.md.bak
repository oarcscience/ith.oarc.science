<span id="P402_78214"></span> <sup>81</sup> Or, "anchovy."

<span id="P403_78274"></span> <sup>82</sup> Or," Melitus."

<span id="P404_78502"></span> <sup>83</sup> The textual reading is in
the present, but obviously requires a past tense.

<span id="P408_78983"></span> <sup>84</sup> Some confusion has crept
into the text. The first clause of the second sentence belongs probably
to the first. The sense would then run thus: "Ecphantus affirmed the
impossibility of dogmatic truth, for that every one was permitted to
frame definitions as he thought proper."

<span id="P409_79467"></span> <sup>85</sup> Or, "that there is,
according to this, a multitude of defined existences, and that such is
infinite."

<span id="P410_79805"></span> <sup>86</sup> Or, "a single power."

<span id="P411_79936"></span> <sup>87</sup> \[So far anticipating modern
science.\]

<span id="P415_80287"></span> <sup>88</sup> Or, "holds."

<span id="P420_81051"></span> <sup>89</sup> Or, "writing." Still
Socrates may be called the father of the Greek philosophy. "From the age
of Aristotle and Plato, the rise of the several Greek sects may be
estimated as so many successful or abortive efforts to carry out the
principles enunciated by Socrates."-*Translator's Treatise on
Metaphysics*, chap. iii. p. 45.

<span id="P421_81418"></span> <sup>90</sup> This word signifies to take
impressions from anything, which justifies the translation, historically
correct, given above. Its literal import is "wipe clean," and in this
sense Hippolytus may intend to assert that Plato wholly appropriated the
philosophy of Socrates. (See Diogenes Laertius, xi. 61, where the same
word occurs.)

<span id="P426_84198"></span> <sup>91</sup> *De Legibus*, iv, 7 (p. 109,
vol. viii. ed. Bekker).

<span id="P427_84612"></span> <sup>92</sup> *Timeus*, c xvi. (p. 277,
voL vii. ed. Bekker). The passage runs thus in the original: "Gods of
gods, of whom I am Creator and Father of works, which having been formed
by Me, are indissoluble, through, at all events, My will."

<span id="P429_86231"></span> <sup>93</sup> The word is literally a cup
or bowl, and, being employed by Plato in an allegorical sense, is
evidently intended to signify the *anima mundi* (soul of the world),
which constituted a sort of depository for all spiritual existences in
the world.

<span id="P430_86584"></span> <sup>94</sup> Or, "that, there exists a
necessity for the corruption of everything created."

<span id="P431_86786"></span> <sup>95</sup> Or, "are confirmed by that
(philosopher Plato), because he asserts," etc.; or, "those who assert
the soul's immortality are especially confirmed in their opinion, as
many as affirm the existence of a future state of retribution."

<span id="P432_87439"></span> <sup>96</sup> Or, "that he changes
different souls," etc.

<span id="P433_87536"></span> <sup>97</sup> Or, "during."

<span id="P435_89975"></span> <sup>98</sup> Diogenes Laertius, in
describing the system of the Stoics, employs the same word in the case
of their view of virtue.

<span id="P436_90521"></span> <sup>99</sup> This is supplied from the
original; the passage occurs in the *Phaedrus*, c. lx. (p. 86;, vol. i.
ed. Bekker).

<span id="P437_90651"></span> <sup>100</sup> The word Adrasteia was a
name for Nemesis, and means here unalterable destiny.

<span id="P438_91234"></span> <sup>101</sup> The passage occurs in
*Clilophon* (p. 244, vol. vi ed Bekker).

<span id="P439_91514"></span> <sup>102</sup> The text, as given by
Miller, is scarcely capable of any meaning. The translation is therefore
conjectural, in accordance with alterations proposed by Schneidewin.

<span id="P440_91839"></span> <sup>103</sup> 0r, "declares."

<span id="P444_94279"></span> <sup>104</sup> Or, "the fifth body, in
which it is supposed to be, along with the other four (elements); "
or,"the fifth body, which is supposed to be (composed) of the other
four."

<span id="P445_94965"></span> <sup>105</sup> Hippolytus expresses
himself in the words of Stobaeus, who says ( *Eclog.*, ii. 274): "And
among reputed external blessings are nobility, wealth, glory, peace,
freedom, friendship."

<span id="P446_95314"></span> <sup>106</sup> Or, "glory, the confirmed
power of friends."

<span id="P450_97195"></span> <sup>107</sup> One of the MSS. elucidated
the simile in the text thus; "But if he is not disposed, there is
absolutely a necessity for his being drawn along. And in like manner
men, if they do not follow fate, seem to be free agents, though the
reason of (their being) fate holds assuredly valid. If, however, they do
not wish to follow, they will absolutely be coerced to enter upon what
has been fore-ordained."

<span id="P451_98025"></span> <sup>108</sup> Or, "is immortal." Diogenes
Laertius (book vii) notices, in his section on Zino, as part of the
Stoic doctrine, "that the soul abides after death, but that it is
perishable."

<span id="P452_98916"></span> <sup>109</sup> Or, "through what is
incorporeal;" that is, through what is void or empty space.

<span id="P453_99026"></span> <sup>110</sup> Or, "resurrection; " or,
"resistance;" that is, a resisting medium.

<span id="P457_99490"></span> <sup>111</sup> The atomic theory is, as
already mentioned by Hippolytus, of more ancient date than Epicurus'
age, being First broached by Leucippus and Democritus. This fact,
however, has, as Cudworth argues, been frequently overlooked by those
who trace the doctrine to no older a source than the founder of the
Epicurean philosophy.

<span id="P458_100999"></span> <sup>112</sup> Or, "that neither has He
business to do, nor does He attend to any. As a consequence of which
fact," etc.

<span id="P459_101358"></span> <sup>113</sup> "Among the Gentiles" seems
a mistake. One reading proposed is, "some (intended) our sensuous
passions; " or, "some understood the passions." The words "among the
Gentiles," the French commentator, the Abbe Cruice, is of opinion, were
added by Christian hands, in order to draw a contrast between the
virtuous Christian and the vicious pagan.

<span id="P463_102486"></span> <sup>114</sup> See Diogenes Laertius'
*Lives*, x. 63 (Bohn's Library); Plutarch, *De Placitis Philosophorum*,
iv. 3.

<span id="P464_103334"></span> <sup>115</sup> Diogenes Laertius,
*Lives*, ix. 75; Sextus Empiricus, *Hypotyp*., i. 188-192.

<span id="P465_103553"></span> <sup>116</sup> This is what the Academics
called "the phenomenon" (Sextus Empiricus, *Pyrrh. Hyp*., i. i9-22).

<span id="P469_104135"></span> <sup>117</sup> This is a mistake in the
manuscript for Ganges, according to Roeper.

<span id="P470_104570"></span> <sup>118</sup> Or, "knowledge." (See
Clemens Alexandrinus, *Strom*., i., xv., lxxii.; Eusebius, *Prapaerat.
Evang*., ix. 6.)

<span id="P471_104903"></span> <sup>119</sup> Athenaeus ( *Deipn*., book
ix ) ascribes this opinion to Plato, who, he tells us, "asserted that
the soul was so constituted, that it should reject its last covering,
that of vanity."

<span id="P472_105155"></span> <sup>120</sup> Or, "they name light their
god; " or, "they celebrate in their own peculiar language God, whom they
name," etc.

<span id="P473_105815"></span> <sup>121</sup> The text here would seem
rather confused. The above translation agrees with Cruice's and
Schneidewin's Latin version. I have doubts about its correctness,
however, and would render it thus: "...enveloped in a body extrinsic to
the divine essence, just as if one wore a sheepskin covering; but that
his body, on being divested of this (covering), would appear visible to
the naked eye." Or, "This discourse whom they name God they affirm to be
incorporeal, but enveloped in a body outside himself (or his own body)
(just as if one carried a covering of sheepskin to have it seen); but
having stripped off the body in which he is enveloped, that he no longer
appears visible to the naked eye." (Roeper.) I am not very confident
that this exactly conveys the meaning of Roeper's somewhat obscure Greek
paraphrase.

<span id="P474_106983"></span> <sup>122</sup> The parenthetical words
Roeper considers introduced into the text from a marginal note.

<span id="P478_107913"></span> <sup>123</sup> Or "Zamalxis," or
"Zametris" (see Menagius on Diogenes Laetrius, viii. 2).

<span id="P479_108016"></span> <sup>124</sup> Or, "of Thracian origin."
The words are omitted in two MSS.

<span id="P484_109285"></span> <sup>125</sup> There are several verbal
differences from the original in Hippolytus' version. These may be seen
on comparing it with Hesiod's own text. The particular place which
Hesiod occupies in the history of philosophy is pointed out by Aristotle
in his *Metaphysics*. The Stagyrite detects in the Hesiodic cosmogony,
in the principle of "love," the dawn of a recognition of the necessity
of an efficient cause to account for the phenomena of nature. It was
Aristotle himself, however, who built up the science of causation; and
in this respect humanity owes that extraordinary man a deep debt of
gratitude.
