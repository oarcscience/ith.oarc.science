Latin and Syriac, from a Vatican' codex, and prefaces it with these
words: Hippolytus wrote on the Song of Solomon, and showed that thus
early did God the Word seek His pleasure in the Church gathered from
among the Gentiles, and especially in His most holy mother the Virgin;
and thus the Syrians, who boasted that the Virgin was born among them,
translated the Commentary of Hippolytus at a very early period from the
Greek into their own tongue, of which some fragments still remain, -as,
for example, one to this effect on the above words.
