But the learned editor has not been sufficiently prudent in noting his author's perpetual misconceptions of antiquity.</P>

<SUP>16 </SUP>Galen composed treaties on the figures of syllogismis, and on philosophy in general. This is also a notable testimony, as proceeding from a very ancient author, almost contemporary with Galen himself. And from a great number of other writers, as well as this one. it is evident that Galen was ranked as the equal of Aristotle, Theophrastus, and even Plato. [Galen died <I>circa</I>  a.d. 200.]</P>
