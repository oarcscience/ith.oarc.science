(Roeper).

<span id="P301_43864"></span> <sup>24</sup> Or," that which is divine."
See Clemens Alexandrinus, *Strom*., v. pp. 461, 463 (Heinisus and
Sylburgius' ed.). Thales, on being asked, "What is God?!" "That,"
replied he, "which has neither beginning nor end."

<span id="P302_44522"></span> <sup>25</sup> Or, "see."

<span id="P306_45361"></span> <sup>26</sup> Or, "nature."

<span id="P307_45434"></span> <sup>27</sup> "And arithmetic" (added by
Roeper).

<span id="P309_46426"></span> <sup>28</sup> Or, "and he first."

<span id="P310_46484"></span> <sup>29</sup> Or, "physiognomy."

<span id="P311_46918"></span> <sup>30</sup> Or, "in conformity with his
hypothesis."

<span id="P312_47550"></span> <sup>31</sup> Or, "the third."

<span id="P313_47796"></span> <sup>32</sup> Or, "an everlasting nature;"
or, "having the roots of an everlasting nature in itself," the words "as
it were" being omitted in some MSS.

<span id="P314_48128"></span> <sup>33</sup> Or, "production."

<span id="P315_48253"></span> <sup>34</sup> 1t should be probably,
"monad, number." The monad was with Pythagoras, and in imitation of him
with Leibnitz, the highest generalization of number, and a conception in
abstraction, commensurate with what we call essence, whether of matter
or spirit.

<span id="P316_48711"></span> <sup>35</sup> Kobisqh in text must be
rendered" multiplied." The formulary is self-evident: (a2)2 = a4, (a2)3
= a6, (a3)3 = a9.

<span id="P318_49392"></span> <sup>36</sup> Or Thallis, Aethalides, a
son of Hermes, was herald of the Argonauts, and said never to have
forgotten anything. In this way his soul remembered its successive
migrations into the bodies of Euphorbus, Hermotimus, Pyrrhus, and
Pythagoras. (See Diogenes' *Lives*, book viii. chap. i. sec. 4.)

<span id="P319_49847"></span> <sup>37</sup> No name occurs more
frequently in the annals of Greek literature than that of Diodorus. One,
however, wiih the title "of Eretria," as far is the translator knows, is
mentioned only by Hippolytus; so that this is likely another Diodorus to
be added to the long list already cxisting. It may be that Dioclorus
Eretriensis is the same as Diodorus Crotnniates, a Pythagorean
philospher. See Fabricius' *Biblioth. Grac.*, lib ii. cap. iii., lib.
iii. cap. xxxi.; also Meursius' *Annotations*, p. 20, *on Chalcidius'
Commentary on Plato's Timaeus*. The article in *Smith's Dictionary* is a
transcript of these.

<span id="P320_50465"></span> <sup>38</sup> Aristoxenus is mentioned by
Cicero in his *Tusculan Questions*, book i. chap. i. xviii, as having
broached a theory in psychology, which may have suggested, in modern
times, to David Hartley his hypothesis of sensation being the result of
nerval vibrations. Cicero says of Aristoxenus, "that he was so charmed
with his own harmonies, that he sought to transfer them into
investigations concerning our corporeal and spiritual nature."

<span id="P321_50955"></span> <sup>39</sup> Zaratas is another form of
the name Zoroaster.

<span id="P322_51393"></span> <sup>40</sup> Or, "is a nature according
to musical harmony" (preceding note); or, "The cosmica system is a
nature and a musical harmony."

<span id="P323_51707"></span> <sup>41</sup> Zaras, or Zoroaster, is
employed as a sort of generic denomination for philosopher by the
Orieintals, who, whatever portions of Asia they inhabit, mostly ascribe
their speculative systems try a Zoroaster. No less than six individuals
bearing this name are spoken of. Arnobius ( *Contr. Gentes*., i. 52)
mentions four-(1) a Chaldean, (2) Bactrian, (3) Pamphylian, (4)
Armenian. Pliny mentions a fifth as a native of Proconnesus ( *Nat.
Hist.*., xxx. 1), while Apaleius ( *Florida*, ii. 15) a sixth Zoroaster,
a native of Babylon, and contemporar with Pythagoras, the one evidently
alluded to by Hippolytus. (See translator's *Treatise on Metaphisics*,
chap. ii.)

<span id="P324_52633"></span> <sup>42</sup> Or, "that it was hot and
cold," or "hot of moist."

<span id="P325_53023"></span> <sup>43</sup> Or it might be rendered, "a
process of arrangement." The Abbe Cruice (in his edition of
*Hippolytus*, Paris, 1860) suggests a different reading, which would
make the words translate thus, "when the earth was an undigested and
solid mass."

<span id="P326_53325"></span> <sup>44</sup> \[See book vi. cap. xxii.,
*infra*, and note. But Clement gives another explanation. See vol. ii.
p. 385, this series.\]

<span id="P328_54898"></span> <sup>45</sup> Or, "Zametus."

<span id="P329_55329"></span> <sup>46</sup> Or, "leading them down into
cells, made them," etc.; or, "made his disciples observe silence," etc.

<span id="P335_56167"></span> <sup>47</sup> Or, "and beast," more in
keeping with the sense of the name; or "a lamb" has been suggested in
the Gottingen edition of Hippolytus.

<span id="P336_56335"></span> <sup>48</sup> Or, "traveller into the
sea;" or, "mute ones from the sea;" or, "from the sea a glittering
fish."

<span id="P338_56580"></span> <sup>49</sup> Or, "being the instructor of
this (philosopher)."

<span id="P342_57177"></span> <sup>50</sup> Proclus, in his commentary
on Plato's *Timaeus*, uses almost the same words: "but Heraclitus, in
asserting his own universal knowledge, makes out all the rest of mankind
ignorant."

<span id="P344_58772"></span> <sup>51</sup> Or, "and among these,
Socrates a moral philosopher, and Aristotle a logician, originated
systems."

<span id="P348_59698"></span> <sup>52</sup> Or, "men."

<span id="P349_59913"></span> <sup>53</sup> Or, "moist."

<span id="P350_59961"></span> <sup>54</sup> Or, "congealed snow."

<span id="P351_60054"></span> <sup>55</sup> That is, Antipodes. Diogenes
Laertius was of the opinion that Plato first indicated by name the
Antipodes.

<span id="P352_60636"></span> <sup>56</sup> Or, "727 times," is an
improbable reading.

<span id="P353_60872"></span> <sup>57</sup> "In moisture" is properly
added, as Plutarch, in his *De Placitis*, v. xix., remarks that
"Anthimander affirms that prinmiary animials were produced in moisture."

<span id="P354_61386"></span> <sup>58</sup> This word seems requisite to
the sense of the passage.

see Jarvis, *Introd.*, p. 21.\]

<span id="P359_62677"></span> <sup>60</sup> Or, "revolutionary motion."

<span id="P360_63613"></span> <sup>61</sup> Plutarch, in his *De
Placitis Philosophorum*, attributes both opinions to Anaximenes, viz.,
that the sun was moved both under and around the earth.

<span id="P361_64900"></span> <sup>62</sup> \[ B.C. 556.\]

<span id="P365_65061"></span> <sup>63</sup> Aristotle considers that
Anaxaporas was the first to broach the existence of efficient causes in
nature. He states, however, that Hermotimus received the credit of so
doing at an earlier date.

<span id="P366_65279"></span> <sup>64</sup> Or, Hegesephontus.

<span id="P367_65666"></span> <sup>65</sup> Simplicius, in his
*Commentary on Aristotle's Physics*, where (book i. c. 2) Anaxagoras is
spoken of, says that the latter maintained that "all things existed
simultaneously-infinite things, and plurality, and diminutiveness, for
even what was diminutive was infinite." (See *Aristotle's,Metaphysics*,
iii. 4, Macmahon's translation, p. 93.) This explains Hippolytus'
remark, while it suggests an emendation of the text.

<span id="P368_67332"></span> <sup>66</sup> Or, "in the Antipodes; " or,
"from the snow in Aethiopia."

<span id="P369_68785"></span> <sup>67</sup> Or, "overpowered by the
sun," that is, whose light was lost in the superior brilliancy of the
sun.

<span id="P370_69422"></span> <sup>68</sup> Or, "were generated."

<span id="P371_69738"></span> <sup>69</sup> \[Died B.C. 428 or 429.\]

<span id="P375_70043"></span> <sup>70</sup> \[ B.C. 440.\]

<span id="P376_71619"></span> <sup>71</sup> Or, "both many of the rest
of the animal kingdom, and man himself." (See Diogenes Laertius'
*Lives*, ii. 17.)

<span id="P377_72216"></span> <sup>72</sup> There is some confusion in
the text here, but the rendering given above, though conjectural, is
highly probable. One proposed emendation would make the passage run
thus: "for that each body employed mind, sometimes slower, sometimes
faster."

<span id="P382_73274"></span> <sup>73</sup> \[ B.C. 500\]

<span id="P383_73686"></span> <sup>74</sup> The next sentence is
regarded by some as not genuine.

<span id="P387_73990"></span> <sup>75</sup> \[ B.C. 37O.\]

<span id="P388_74497"></span> <sup>76</sup> Or, "when again mutually
connected, that different entities were generated." (See Diogenes
Laertius' *Lives*, ix. 30-32.)

<span id="P392_74867"></span> <sup>77</sup> \[Died in his hundred and
ninth year, B.C. 361.\]

<span id="P393_75005"></span> <sup>78</sup> Or, "Audera."

Xenophanes.\]
