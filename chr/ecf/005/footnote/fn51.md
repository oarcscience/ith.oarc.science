many conjectures as to the meaning at this. Perhaps the most plausible
is the emendation, "Petrario" "in the mines."

<span id="P5105_1548847"></span> <sup>7</sup> This epistle, as well as
the preceding, seems to be very imperfect, having probably been
"written," says the Oxford translator, "by persons little versed in
writing,-confessors, probably, of the less instructed sort." The meaning
in many places is very unsatisfactory.

<span id="P5125_1555959"></span> <sup>1</sup> Oxford ed.: Ep. xxix. The
numbering of the epistles has hitherto been in accordance with Migne's
edition of the text: but as he here follows a typographical error in
numbering the epistle "xxiv.," and all the subsequent ones accordingly,
it has been thought better to continue the correct order in this
translation. In each'case, therefore, after this. the number of the
epistle in the translation will be one earlier than in Migne.

<span id="P5130_1557579"></span> <sup>2</sup> Not "teachers and
presbyters," as in the Oxford translation, but "teacbing presbyters."
For these were a distinct class of presbyters-all not being teachers,-
and these were to be judges of the fitness of such as were to be
*teachers of the hearers*. \[According to Cyprian's theory, all
presbyters shared in the government and celebrated the Lord's Supper,
but only the more learned and gifted were preachers. 1 Tim. iv. 17.\]
