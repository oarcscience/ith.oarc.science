<span id="P10001_3107128"></span> <sup>22</sup> An acephalous fragment
on the canon of the sacred Scriptures,ascribed by some to Caius. This
very important fragment \[vol. ii. pp. 4 and 56, this series\] was
discovered by Muiatori in the Ambrosian Library at Milan, and published
by him in his *Antiquitates Italicae*in 1740. This manuscript belongs to
the seventh or eighth century. Muratori ascribed it to Caius, Bunsen to
Hegesippus; but there is no clue whatever to the authorship. From
internal evidence the writer of the fragment is believed to belong to
the latter half of the second century. The fragment has been much
discussed. For a full account of it, see Westcott's *General Survey of
the History of the Canon of the New Testament*, 2d ed. p. 184f., and
Tregelies' *Canon Muratorianus*; \[also Routh, *Rel.*, i. pp. 394-434\].

<span id="P10003_3108034"></span> <sup>23</sup> The text is, " quibus
tamen interfuit et ita posuit." Westcott omits the " et." Bunsen
proposes" ipse non intermit." The reference probably is to the statement
of Papias (Euseb., *Histor. Eccles*., iii. 39) as to Mark's Gospel being
a narrative not of what he himself witnessed, but of what he heard from
Peter.

<span id="P10004_3108455"></span> <sup>24</sup> The text gives " numine
suo ex opinione concriset," for which we read " nomine suo ex ordine
conscripsit" with Westcott.

<span id="P10005_3108667"></span> <sup>25</sup> Reading" secum" for "
secundum."

<span id="P10006_3108731"></span> <sup>26</sup> The text gives " quasi
ut juris studiosum," for which " quasi et virtutis studiosum," = "as one
devoted to virtue," has been proposed. Bunsen reads "itineris socium" =
"as his companion in the way."

<span id="P10007_3109038"></span> <sup>27</sup> " Incepit" for "
incipet."

noteworthy statement.\]

<span id="P10014_3111002"></span> <sup>33</sup> Reading" epistolae" and

<span id="P10016_3111242"></span> <sup>34</sup> *Principium*.

<span id="P10017_3111695"></span> <sup>35</sup> The text is, " de quibus
singulis necesse est a nobis disputari cum," etc. Bunsen reads," de
quibus non necesse est a nobis disputari cur" = "on which we need not
discuss the reason why."

man had violated discipline, and broken his most sacred obligations to
the Christian flock, at a time when the heathen persecutions made all
such scandals little less than mutiny against Christ Himself. Consult
Matt. xviii. 7 and Luke xvii. 1. We owe to such discipline the sure
canon of Scripture.\]

the twenty-eighth he enters upon the dilffuse explanation also of those
words of our creed which commend to us faith in the Son of God, Jesus
Christ, the Lord our God, the Christ promised in the Old Testament, and
proves by the authority of the old and new covenant that He is very man
and very God. In chapter eighteenth he refutes the error of the
Sabellians, and by the authority of the sacred writings he establishes
the distinction of the Father and of the Son, and replies to the
objections of the abovenamed heresiarchs and others. In the twenty-ninth
chapter he treats of faith in the Holy Spirit, saying that finally the
authority of the high admonishes us, after the Father and the Son, to
believe also on the Holy Spirit, whose operations he recounts and proves
from the Scriptures. He then labours to associate the unity of God with
the matters previously contended for, and at length sets forth the sum
of the doctrines above explained. \[Anthropopathy, see cap. v. p. 615.\]
