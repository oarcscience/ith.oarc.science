Theodoret has taken his account (*Haer. Fab*., i. 19) from this tenth

<span id="P2437_790290"></span> <sup>26</sup> There is here a hiatus,
which Abbe Cruice thinks is caused by those portions of the ms. being
lost, in which Hippolytus furnishes his Summary of the Jewish Sects. The
object of introducing these genealogical and ethnic remaks might at
first seem irrelevant; but they are intended to be subservient to
Hippolytus' *Demostration of the Truth*, by proving the superior
antiquity, as coming down from Abraham, of revelation above all pagan
philosophy. \[See,cap. xxvii. *infra*\] Abbe Cruise refers us to his
work (pp. 72-77), *Etudes sur de Nouveaux Documents Historiques

<span id="P2443_792485"></span> <sup>32</sup> The system of seventy-two
nations here adopted by Hippolytus is that advanced by Jewish writers
generally, and has been probably deduced from the tenth chapter of
Genesis Another historian of the heresies of the Church adopts
it-Epiphanius. A chronographer, however, contemporary with
Hippolytus-Julius Africanus-discarded this number, as is proved by the
fragments of his work preserved by Eusebius and Syncellus.

<span id="P2444_793325"></span> <sup>33</sup> The allusion here made
constitutes a strong reason for ascribing *The Refutation*to Hippolytus,
the author of which here states that he had written a *Chronicle*. But
the fragment in our text corresponds with a Latin translation of a
*Chronicon*given by Fabricius, and bearing the name of Hippolytus. The
terms in which Hippolytus delivers himself above imply that he was the
inventor of a chronological system, thus harmonizing with the fact that
the Paschal Cycle, though ever so faulty, was selected out of all his
writings for being inscribed on Hippolytus' statue, dug up on the road
to Tivoli .a d. 1551, in the vicinity of Rome, near the Church of St.
Lorenzo. \[This modest note is of no slight importance to the case, as
elucidated by Bunsen and Wordsworth.\]

<span id="P2445_794561"></span> <sup>34</sup> \[Hippolytus does not call

criticism which ascribes *The Refutation*to Origin. But even supposing

name on the margin, as indicating the transcriber's opinion concerning
the coincidence of creed between Origen and the aÂ¯thor of *The

punishment, asserted in the concluding chapter of *The Refutation*, was
actually controverted by Origen. See translator's Introductory Notice.

<span id="P2461_801732"></span> <sup>43</sup> Here we have another
reference intimately bearin on the authorship of *The Refutation*. What
follows corresponds with a fragment having a similar title to that
stated above, first published by Le Moyne, and inserted in Fabricius (i.
pp. 22O - 222) as the work of Hippolytus. Photics mentions this work,
and give an extract from it corresponding with what is furnished by
Hippolytus. Photius, however, mentions that the book *On the Substance
of the Universe*was said to be written by Josephus, but discovers in
marginal notes the asription of it to Caius. But Caius cannot be the
writer, since Photius states that the author of *The Labyrinth*affirmed
that he had written *0n the Substance of the Universe*. Now Hippolytus
informs us that he is author of *The Labyrinth*. Hippolytus thus refers
to three of his works in *The Refutation*: (I) eterai bibloi, i.e., on
Chronology; (2) *Concerning the Substance of the Universe*; (3) *Little
Labyrinth*. Except Hippolytus and Photics refer to different works in
speaking of *The Labyrinth*, the foregoing settles the question of the
authorship of *The Refutation*. \[See the case of Caius stated.

parallel in this and other portions of Hippolytus' concluding remarks,

here follows his master Irenaeus (*Haer*., iv. 9), and in doing so
enunciatess an Opinion, and uses an expression adopted universally by
patristic writers, up to the period of St. Augustine. This great
philosopher and divine, however, shook the entire fabric of existing
theology respecting the will, and started diffculties, speculative ones
at least, which admit of no solution short of the annihilation of finite
thought and volition. See translator's *Treatise on Metaphysics*, chap.
x. \[Also compare Irenaeus, vol. i.p. 518, and Clement, vol. ii. pp. 319

<span id="P2475_808484"></span> <sup>53</sup> Dr. Wordsworth translates
the passage thus: "Endued with free will, but not dominant; having
reason, but not able to govern," etc.

<span id="P2481_810278"></span> <sup>58</sup> In making the Logos a
living principle in the prophets, and as speaking through them to the
Church of God in all ages, Hippolytus agrees with Origen. This
constitutes another reason for the marginal note "Origen's opinion,"
already mentioned. (See Origen, peri =arxwn, i. I.)

<span id="P2482_810631"></span> <sup>59</sup> Hippolytus expresses
similar opinions respecting the economy of the prophets, in his work,
*De Antichristo*, sec. 2.

<span id="P2483_810993"></span> <sup>60</sup> Hippolytus here compares
the ancient prophets with the oracles of the Gentiles. The heathen seers
did not give forth their vaticinations spontaneously, but furnished
responses to those only who made inquiries after them, says Dr.
Wordsworth.

<span id="P2485_812924"></span> <sup>61</sup> pefurakota, This is the
reading adopted by Cruice and Wordsworth. The translator has followed
Cruice's rendering, *refinxisse*while Dr. Wordsworth construes the word
"fashioned." The latter is mare literal, as furawmeans to knead, though
the sense imparted to it by Cruice would seem more coincident with the
scriptural account ( 1 Cor. v. 7; 2 Cor. v. 17; Gal. vi. 15). Bunsen
does not alter peforhkota, the reading of the its, and translates it,
"to have put on the old man through a new formation." Sauppe reads
pefurhkota. See Hippolytus, *De Antichristo*, sec. 26, *in Danielem* (p.
205, Mai); and Irenaeus, v. 6.

<span id="P2486_813697"></span> <sup>62</sup> \[See Irenaeus (a very
beautiful passage), voL i. p. 391.\]

<span id="P2487_814074"></span> <sup>63</sup> \[See vol. iv. pp, 255 and
383.\]

<span id="P2488_815130"></span> <sup>64</sup> This is the reading
adopted by Cruice and Bunsen. Dr. Wordsworth translates the passage
thus: "acknowledging thyself a man of like nature with Christ, and thou
also waiting for the appearance of what thou gavest Him." The source of
consolatian to man which Hippolytus, according to Dr. Wordsworth, is
here anxious to indicate, is the glorification of human nature in the
person of the Lord Jesus Christ. Dr. Wordsworth therefore objects to
Bunsen's rendermg, as it gives to the passage a meaning different from
this.

<span id="P2492_815952"></span> <sup>65</sup> \[The translator's
excessive interpolations sometimes needlessly dilute the terse
characteristics of the author. Thus, with confusing brackets, the
Edinburgh reads: "who so often lead your armies to victory." This is not
Hippolytus, and, in such instances, I feel bound to reduce a plethoric
text.\]

<span id="P2493_816594"></span> <sup>66</sup> \[Here the practical idea
of the *Philosophumena*comes out; and compare vol. iv. pp. 469 and
570.\]

<span id="P2494_816889"></span> <sup>67</sup> Dr. Wordsworth justifies
Hippolytus' use of the pagan word "Tartarus," by citing the passage (2
Pet. ii. 4), "For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast
them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness (seiraij
zofou tartarwsaj), to be reserved unto judgment," etc. \[Elucidation
XVII. and vol. iv. 140.\]

<span id="P2496_817333"></span> <sup>68</sup> Schneidewin suggests a
comparison of this passage with Hippolytus' fragment, *Against Plato,
concerning the Cause of the Universe*(p 22O, ed. Fabricii; p. 68, ed. de
Lagarde).

<span id="P2497_817730"></span> <sup>69</sup> The different renderings
of this passage, according to different readings, are as follow: "And
the worm the scum of the body, turning to the Body that foamed it forth
as to that which nourisheth it" (Wordsworth). "The worm which winds
itself without rest round the mouldering body, to feed upon it" (Bunsen
and Scott). "The worm wriggling as over the filth of the (putrescent)
flesh towards the exhaling body" (Roeper). "The worm turning itself
towards the substance of the body, towards, (I say,) the exhalations of
the decaying frame, as to food" (Schneidewm). The words chiefly altered
are: opousian, into (I) ep ousian, (2) ep= alousia(3) apaustwj; and
epistrefouenoninto (I) epistrefon, (2) epi trofhn.

<span id="P2498_818969"></span> <sup>70</sup> \[This startling
expression is justified by such texts as 2 Pet. i. 4compared with John
xvii. 22, 23, and Rev. iii. 21. Thus, Christ overrules the Tempter (Gen.
