"Soliassus and Budinarius" The Oxford editor changes it into
Burdonarius, meaning a "carrier on mules." Salmasius, in a long note on
a passage in the life of Aurelian (*Hist. Aug*., p. 408), proposes
*butinarius*, which he derives from Butinh, a cruet for containing
vinegar, etc., and which he identifies with Bouttij, the original of our
*bottle*. *Butinarias*would then mean a maker of vessels suitable for
containing vinegar, etc. See Sophocles' *Glossary of Byzantine Greek, s.
v.*Bouttij. \[Probably low Latin for a maker of force-meats. Spanish,
*budin*.\]
