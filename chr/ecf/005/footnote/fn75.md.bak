distinguished true patience from the false patience of philosophers, he
commends Christian patience by the patience of God, of Christ, and of
all righteous men. He further proves, as well by Scripture as by reason,
and, moreover, by the instances of Job and Tobias, that not only is
patience useful, but that it is needful also; and in order that the
excellence of patience may shine forht the more by contra.it with the
vice opposed to it, he sets forth what is the evil of impatience.
Finally, he reproves the desire of vengeance, and teaches that revenge
ought, according to Scripture, to be left to God rather than to be
arrogated to ourselves. If in any writing Cyprian is an imitator of
Tertullian, assuredly in this he imitates that writer's treatise *On
Patience*. \[See vol. iii. p. 707.\]
