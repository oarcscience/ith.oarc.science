<span id="P6939_2239175"></span> <sup>1</sup> The deacon Pontius, in hie
life of Cyprian, in few words comprises the argument of the following
treatise. "Who," says he, "would restrain virgins into a fitting
discipline of modesty, and a dress meet for holiness, as if with a
bridle of the Lord's lessons?"

<span id="P6942_2240263"></span> <sup>2</sup> After this he teaches from
the Apostle, and from the third chapter of' Isaiah also, that
distinctions of dress and ornaments are more suited to prostitutes than
to virgins; and he infers that, while so many things are offensive to
God, more especially are the sumptuous ornanients of women; and
therefore making a transition from superfluous ornament to the different
kinds of dyes and paints, he forbids such things, not only to virgins,
but absolutely also to married women, who assuredly cannot with impunity
strive to improve, to transfigure, and to adulterate God's work.
