<SUP>83 </SUP>The textual reading is in the present, but obviously requires a past tense.</P>

<P><A NAME="P408_78983"></A>
<SUP>84 </SUP>Some confusion has crept into the text. The first clause of the second sentence belongs probably to the first. The sense would then run thus: "Ecphantus affirmed the impossibility of dogmatic truth, for that every one was permitted to frame definitions as he thought proper."</P>

<P><A NAME="P409_79467"></A>
<SUP>85 </SUP>Or, "that there is, according to this, a multitude of defined existences, and that such is infinite."</P>

<SUP>89 </SUP>Or, "writing." Still Socrates may be called the father of the Greek philosophy. "From the age of Aristotle and Plato, the rise of the several Greek sects may be estimated as so many successful or abortive efforts to carry out the principles enunciated by Socrates."-<I>Translator's Treatise on Metaphysics</I>, chap. iii. p. 45.</P>

<P><A NAME="P421_81418"></A>
<SUP>90 </SUP>This word signifies to take impressions from anything, which justifies the translation, historically correct, given above. Its literal import is "wipe clean," and in this sense Hippolytus may intend to assert that Plato wholly appropriated the philosophy of Socrates. (See Diogenes Laertius, xi. 61, where the same word occurs.) </P>

<P><A NAME="P429_86231"></A>
<SUP>93 </SUP>The word is literally a cup or bowl, and, being employed by Plato in an allegorical sense, is evidently intended to signify the <I>anima mundi</I> (soul of the world), which constituted a sort of depository for all spiritual existences in the world.</P>

<P><A NAME="P430_86584"></A>

<SUP>98 </SUP>Diogenes Laertius, in describing the system of the Stoics, employs the same word in the case of their view of virtue.</P>

<P><A NAME="P436_90521"></A>
<SUP>99 </SUP>This is supplied from the original; the passage occurs in the <I>Phaedrus</I>, c. lx. (p. 86;, vol. i. ed. Bekker).</P>

<SUP>100 </SUP>The word Adrasteia was a name for Nemesis, and means here unalterable destiny.</P>

<P><A NAME="P439_91514"></A>
<SUP>102 </SUP>The text, as given by Miller, is scarcely capable of any meaning. The translation is therefore conjectural, in accordance with alterations proposed by Schneidewin.</P>

<P><A NAME="P445_94965"></A>
<SUP>105 </SUP>Hippolytus expresses himself in the words of Stobaeus, who says (<I> Eclog.</I>, ii. 274): "And among reputed external blessings are nobility, wealth, glory, peace, freedom, friendship."</P>

<P><A NAME="P446_95314"></A>
<SUP>106 </SUP>Or, "glory, the confirmed power of friends."</P>

<P><A NAME="P450_97195"></A>
<SUP>107 </SUP>One of the MSS. elucidated the simile in the text thus; "But if he is not disposed, there is absolutely a necessity for his being drawn along. And in like manner men, if they do not follow fate, seem to be free agents, though the reason of (their being) fate holds assuredly valid. If, however, they do not wish to follow, they will absolutely be coerced to enter upon what has been fore-ordained."</P>

<P><A NAME="P451_98025"></A>
<SUP>108 </SUP>Or, "is immortal." Diogenes Laertius (book vii) notices, in his section on Zino, as part of the Stoic doctrine, "that the soul abides after death, but that it is perishable."</P>

<SUP>111 </SUP>The atomic theory is, as already mentioned by Hippolytus, of more ancient date than Epicurus' age, being First broached by Leucippus and Democritus. This fact, however, has, as Cudworth argues, been frequently overlooked by those who trace the doctrine to no older a source than the founder of the Epicurean philosophy.</P>

<P><A NAME="P459_101358"></A>
<SUP>113 </SUP>"Among the Gentiles" seems a mistake. One reading proposed is, "some (intended) our sensuous passions; " or, "some understood the passions." The words "among the Gentiles," the French commentator, the Abbe Cruice, is of opinion, were added by Christian hands, in order to draw a contrast between the virtuous Christian and the vicious pagan.</P>

<P><A NAME="P473_105815"></A>
<SUP>121 </SUP>The text here would seem rather confused. The above translation agrees with Cruice's and Schneidewin's Latin version. I have doubts about its correctness, however, and would render it thus: "...enveloped in a body extrinsic to the divine essence, just as if one wore a sheepskin covering; but that his body, on being divested of this (covering), would appear visible to the naked eye." Or, "This discourse whom they name God they affirm to be incorporeal, but enveloped in a body outside himself (or his own body) (just as if one carried a covering of sheepskin to have it seen); but having stripped off the body in which he is enveloped, that he no longer appears visible to the naked eye." (Roeper.) I am not very confident that this exactly conveys the meaning of Roeper's somewhat obscure Greek paraphrase.</P>

<P><A NAME="P474_106983"></A>
<SUP>122 </SUP>The parenthetical words Roeper considers introduced into the text from a marginal note.</P>

<P><A NAME="P478_107913"></A>

<SUP>124 </SUP>Or, "of Thracian origin." The words are omitted in two MSS.</P>

<P><A NAME="P484_109285"></A>
<SUP>125 </SUP>There are several verbal differences from the original in Hippolytus' version. These may be seen on comparing it with Hesiod's own text. The particular place which Hesiod occupies in the history of philosophy is pointed out by Aristotle in his <I>Metaphysics</I>. The Stagyrite detects in the Hesiodic cosmogony, in the principle of "love," the dawn of a recognition of the necessity of an efficient cause to account for the phenomena of nature. It was Aristotle himself, however, who built up the science of causation; and in this respect humanity owes that extraordinary man a deep debt of gratitude.</P>
