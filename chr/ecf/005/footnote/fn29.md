Isaiah with the view of making the most of the favourable disposition
entertained by the Emperor Alexander Severus towards the Christians, and

<span id="P2927_929739"></span> <sup>145</sup> That Hippolytus wrote on
Jeremiah is recorded, so far as I know, by none of the ancients; For the
quotation given in the *Catena*of Greek fathers on Jer. xvii. 11is taken
from his book *On Antichrist*, chap. 1v. Rufinus mentions that
Hippolytus wrote on a certain part of the prophet Ezekiel, viz., on
those chapters which contain the description of the temple of Jerusalem;
and of that commentary the following fragments are preserved.-*De

me again refer to Dr. Pusey's work an Daniel, as invaluable in this
connection. The comments of our author on this book and on "the

<span id="P2954_941453"></span> <sup>160</sup> This is what Photius
condemned in Hippolytus. Irenaeus, however, held the same opinion (book
v. c. 28 and 29). The same view is expressed yet earlier in the Epistle
of Barnabas (sec. 15). It was an opinion adopted from the rabbis.

who was contemporary with Hippolytus. As to the duration of the Greek
empire, Hippolytus and Africanus make it both 300 years, if we follow
Jerome's version of the latter in his comment on Dan. ix. 24. Eusebius
makes it seventy years longer in his *Demonstr. Evag*., viii. 2.
