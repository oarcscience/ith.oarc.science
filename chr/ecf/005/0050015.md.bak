##  Elucidations.

I

Who first propounded these heresies, p. 11.

Hippolytus seems to me to have felt the perils to the pure Gospel of
many admissions made by Clement and other Alexandrian doctors as to the
merits of some of the philosophers of the Gentiles. Very gently, but
with prescient genius, he adopts this plan of tracing the origin and all
the force of heresies to "philosophy falsely so called." The existence
of this "cloud of locusts" is (1) evidence of the antagonism of Satan;
(2) of the prophetic spirit of the apostles; (3) of the tremendous
ferment produced by the Gospel leaven as soon as it was hid in the
"three measures of meal" by "the Elect Lady," the *Ecclesia Dei*; (4) of
the fidelity of the witnesses,-that grand, heroic glory of the
Ante-Nicene Fathers,-who never suffered these heresies to be mistaken
for the faith, or to corrupt the Scriptures; and (5) finally of the
power of the Holy Spirit, who gave them victory over errors, and enabled
them to define truth in all the crystalline beauty of that "Mountain of
Light," that true Koh-i-noor, the Nicene Symbol. Thus, also, Christ's
promises were fulfilled.

Caulacau, p. 52.

See Irenaeus, p. 350, vol. i., this series, where I have explained this
jargon of heresy. But I think it worth while to make use here of two
notes on the subject, which I made in
1845,<sup>[76](footnote/fn25.md)</sup> with little foresight of these tasks
in 1885.

Fleury (tom. ii.) makes this statement: "Les Nicolaites donnaient une
infinite de noms barbares aux princes et aux puissances qu'ils mettaient
en chaque ciel. Ils en nommaient un *caulaucauch*, abusant d'un passage
d'Isaie, ou se lisent ces mots hebreux: *cau-la-cau, cau-la-cau*, pour
representer l'insolence avec laquelle les impies se moquaient du
prophete, en repetant plusieurs fois quelques-unes de ses paroles."
Compare Guerricus, thus: "Vox illa taedii et des-perationis, quaeapud
Isaiam (Isaiah 28:13) legitur, quia, viz., moram faciente Domino,
frequentibus nuntiis ejus increduli et illusores insultare videntur:
*manda remanda*, " etc. See the spurious *Bernardina*, "de Adventu Dom.,
serm. i.," S. Bernard., opp. Paris (ed. Mabillon), vol. ii. P. 1799.

III

The Phrygians call Papa, p. 54.

Hippolytus had little idea, when he wrote this, what the word *Papa* was
destined to signify in mediaeval Rome. The *Abba* of Holy Writ has its
equivalent in many Oriental languages, as well as in the Greek and
Latin, through which it has passed into all the dialects of Europe. It
was originally given to all *presbyters*, as implied in their name of
*elders*, and was a title of humility when it became peculiar to the
bishops, as (1 Peter 5:3) *non Domini sed patres*. St. Paul (1
Corinthians 4:15) shows that "in Christ"-that is, under Him-we may have
such "fathers; "and thus, while he indicates the true sense of the
precept, he leads us to recognise a *prophetic force* and admonition in
our Saviour's words (Matthew 23:1), "Call no man your father upon the
earth." Thus interpreted, these words seem to be a warning against the
sense to which this name, *Papa*, became, long afterwards, restricted,
in Western Europe: *Notre St. Pere, le Pape*, as they say in France.
This was done by the decree of the ambitious Hildebrand, Gregory VII.
(who died a.d. 1085), when, in a synod held at Rome, he defined that
"the title *Pope* should be peculiar to one only in the Christian
world." The Easterns, of course, never paid any respect to this novelty
and dictation, and to this day their patriarchs are popes; and not only
so, for the parish priests of the Greek churches are called by the same
name. I was once cordially invited to take a repast "with the *pope*,"
on visiting a Greek church on the shores of the Adriatic. It is said,
however, that a distinction is made between the words pa/paj and papa=j;
the latter being peculiar to inferiors, according to the refinements of
Goar, a Western critic. *Valeat quantum*. But I must here note, that as
"words are things," and as infinite damage has been done to history and
to Christian truth by tolerating this empiricism of Rome, I have
restored scientific accuracy, in this series, whenever reference is made
to the primitive bishops of Rome, who were no more "Popes" than
Cincinnatus was an emperor. It is time that theological science should
accept, like other sciences, the language of truth and the terminology
of demonstrated fact. The early bishops of Rome were geographically
important, and were honoured as sitting in the only apostolic see of the
West; but they were almost inconsiderable in the structural work of the
ante-Nicene ages, and have left no appreciable impress on its theology.
After the Council of Nice they were recognised as patriarchs, though
equals among brethren, and nothing more. The ambition of Boniface III.
led him to name himself "universal bishop." This was at first a mere
name "of intolerable pride," as his predecessor Gregory had called it,
but Nicholas I. (a.d. 858) tried to make it real, and, by means of the
false decretals, created himself the first "Pope" in the modern sense,
imposing his despotism on the West, and identifying it with the polity
of Western churches, which alone submitted to it. Thus, it was never
Catholic, and came into existence only by nullifying the Nicene
Constitutions, and breaking away from Catholic communion with the parent
churches of the East. Compare Casaubon (*Exercit*., xiv. p. 280, etc.)
in his comments on Baronius. I have thus stated with scientific
precision what all candid critics and historians, even the Gallicans
included, enable us to prove. Why, then, keep up the language of fiction
and imposture,<sup>[77](footnote/fn25.htm#P2523_827532.md)</sup> so
confusing to young students? I believe the youthful Oxonians whom our
modern Tertullian carried with him into the papal schism, could never
have been made dupes but for the persistent empiricism of orthodox
writers who practically adopt in words what they refute in argument,
calling all bishops of Rome "Popes," and even including St. Peter's
blessed name in this fallacious
designation.<sup>[78](footnote/fn25.htm#P2524_828037.md)</sup> In this
series I adhere to the logic of facts, calling (1) all the bishops of
Rome from Linus to Sylvester simply bishops; and (2) all their
successors to Nicholas I. "patriarchs" under the Nicene Constitutions,
which they *professed* to honour, though, after Gregory the Great, they
were ever vying with Constantinople to make themselves greater. (3)
Nicholas, who trampled on the Nicene Constitutions, and made the false
decretals the canon law of the Western churches, was therefore the first
"Pope" who answers to the Tridentine definitions. Even these, however,
were never able to make
dogmatic<sup>[79](footnote/fn25.htm#P2525_829106.md)</sup> the claim of
"supremacy," which was first done by Pins IX. in our days. A canonical
*Primacy* is one thing: a self-asserted *Supremacy* is quite another, as
the French doctors have abundantly demonstrated.

IV

Contemporaneous heresy, p. 125.

Here begins that "duplicating of our knowledge" of primitive Rome of
which Bunsen speaks so justly. A thorough mastery of this book will
prepare us to understand the great Cyprian in all his relations with the
Roman Province, and not less to comprehend the affairs of Novatian.

Bunsen, with all respect, does not comprehend the primitive system, and
*reads it backward*, from the modern system, which travesties antiquity
even in its *apparent* conformities. These conformities are only the
borrowing of old names for new contrivances. Thus, he reads the
cardinals of the eleventh century into the simple presbytery of
comprovincial bishops of the third
century,<sup>[80](footnote/fn25.htm#P2531_830152.md)</sup> just as he
elsewhere lugs in the *Ave Maria* of modern Italy to expound the
*Evening Hymn to the
Trinity*.<sup>[81](footnote/fn25.htm#P2532_830299.md)</sup> In a professed
Romanist, like De Maistre, this would be resented as jugglery. But let
us come to facts. Bunsen's preliminary
remarks<sup>[82](footnote/fn25.htm#P2533_830471.md)</sup> are excellent.
But when he comes to note an "exceptional system" in the Roman
"presbytery," he certainly confuses all things. Let us recur to
Tertullian.<sup>[83](footnote/fn25.htm#P2534_830638.md)</sup> See how much
was already established in his day, which the Council of Nicaea
recognised a century later as (ta a0rxai=a e !qh) old primitive
institutions. In all things the Greek churches were the exemplar and the
model for other churches to follow. "Throughout *the provinces of
Greece*," he says, "there are held, in definite localities, those
councils," etc. "If we also, in *our* diverse *provinces*, observe,"
etc. Now, these councils, or "meetings," in spite of the emperors or the
senate who issued mandates against them, as appears from the same
passage, were, in the Roman Province, made up of the comprovincial
bishops: and their gatherings seem to have been called "the Roman
presbytery; "for, as is evident, the bishops and elders were alike
called "presbyters," the word being as common to both orders as the word
*pastors* or *clergymen* in our days. According to the thirty-fourth of
the "Canons Apostolical," as Bunsen remarks, "the bishops of the
suburban towns, including Portus, also formed at that time an integral
part of the Roman presbytery." This word also refers to all the
presbyters of the diocese of Rome itself; and I doubt not originally the
laity had their place, as they did in Carthage: "the apostles, elders,
and brethren" being the formula of Scripture; or, "with the whole
Church," which includes them,-*omni plebe
adstante*.<sup>[84](footnote/fn25.htm#P2535_832040.md)</sup> Now, all this
accounts, as Bunsen justly observes, for the fact that one of the
"presbytery" should be thus repeatedly called presbyter and "at the same
time have the charge of the church at Portus, for which (office) there
was no other title than the old one of *bishop*; for such was the title
of every man who presided *over the congregation* in any city,-at Ostia,
at Tusculum, or in the other suburban cities.

Now let us turn to the
thirty-fourth<sup>[85](footnote/fn25.htm#P2537_832556.md)</sup>
"Apostolical Canon" (so called), and note as follows: "It is necessary
that the bishops of every nation should know who is chief among them,
and should recognise him as their head by doing nothing of great moment
without his consent; and that each of them should do such things only as
pertain to his own parish and *the districts under him. And neither let
him do any thing* without the consent of all, for thus shall there be
unity of heart, and thus shall God be glorified through our Lord Jesus
Christ." I do not pause to expound this word *parish*, for I am
elucidating Hippolytus by Bunsen's aid, and do not intend to interpolate
my own theory of the primitive episcopate.

Let the "Apostolical Constitutions" go for what they are
worth:<sup>[86](footnote/fn25.htm#P2539_833352.md)</sup> I refer to them
only under lead of Dr. Bunsen. But now turn to the Nicene Council (Canon
VI.) as follows: "*Let the ancient customs prevail* in Egypt, Libya, and
Pentapolis, so that the Bishop of Alexandria have jurisdiction in all
these provinces, *since the like is customary in Rome also*. Likewise in
Antioch and *the other provinces*, let the churches retain their
privileges." Here the Province of Rome is recognised as an *ancient*
institution, while its jurisdiction and privileges are equalized with
those of other churches. Now, Rufinus, interpreting this canon, says it
means, "the ancient custom of Alexandria and Rome shall still be
observed; that the one shall have the care or government of the
Egyptian, and the other that of the *suburbicary churches*." Bunsen
refers us to Bingham, and from him we learn that *the suburbicary
region*, as known to the Roman magistrates, included only "a hundred
miles about Rome."<sup>[87](footnote/fn25.htm#P2540_834329.md)</sup> This
seems to have been canonically extended even to Sicily on the south, but
certainly not to Milan on the north. Suffice it, Hippolytus was one of
those *suburbicarian bishops* who sat in the Provincial Council of Rome;
without consent of which the Bishop of Rome could not, canonically, do
anything of importance, as the canon above cited ordains. Such are the
facts necessary to a comprehension of conflicts excited by "the
contemporaneous heresy," here noted.

V

Affairs of the Church, p. 125.

"Zephyrinus *imagines* that he administers the affairs of the Church-an
uninformed and shamefully corrupt man." This word *imagines* is common
with Hippolytus in like cases, and Dr. Wordsworth gives an ingenious
explanation of this usage. But it seems to me to be based upon the
relations of Hippolytus as one of the synod or "presbytery," without
consent of which the bishop could do nothing important. Zephyrinus, on
the contrary, *imagined* himself competent to decide as to the orthodoxy
of a tenet or of a teacher, without his comprovincials. This, too,
relieves our author from the charge of *egotism* when he exults in the
defeat of such a bishop.<sup>[88](footnote/fn25.htm#P2545_835513.md)</sup>
He says, it is true, "Callistus threw off Sabellius through fear of
*me*," and we may readily believe that; but he certainly means to give
honour to others in the Province when he says,"*We* resisted Zephyrinus
and Callistus; ""*We* nearly converted Sabellius; ""All were carried
away by the hypocrisy of CalIistus, except *ourselves*." This man cried
out to his episcopal brethren, "*Ye* are Ditheists," apparently in open
council. His council prevailed over him by the wise leadership of
Hippolytus, however; and he says of the two guilty bishops, "Never, at
any time, *have we been guilty of collusion with them*." They only
*imagined*, therefore, that they were managing the "affairs of the
Church." The fidelity of their comprovincials preserved the faith of the
Apostles in apostolic Rome.

VI

We offered them opposition, p. 125.

Here we see that Hippolytus had no idea of the sense some put upon the
*convenire* of his master
Irenaeus.<sup>[89](footnote/fn25.htm#P2550_836472.md)</sup> It was not
"necessary" for them to *conform* their doctrines to that of the
*Bishop* of Rome, evidently; nor to "the Church of Rome" as represented
by him. To the church which presided over a province, indeed, recourse
was to be had by all belonging to that province; but it is our author's
grateful testimony, that to the *council of comprovincials*, and not to
any one bishop therein, Rome owed its own adhesion to orthodoxy at this
crisis.

All this illustrates the position of Tertullian, who never thinks of
ascribing to Rome any other jurisdiction than that belonging to other
provinces. As seats of testimony, the apostolic sees, indeed, are *all
to be honoured*. "In Greece, go to Corinth; in Asia Minor, to Ephesus;
if you are adjacent to Italy, you have Rome; whence also (an apostolic)
authority is at hand for us in Africa." Such is his view of
"contemporaneous affairs."

VII

Heraclitus the Obscure, p. 126.

"Well might he weep," says Tayler Lewis, "as Lucian represents him, over
his overflowing universe of perishing phenomena, where *nothing stood*;
... nothing was fixed, but, as in a mixture, all things were
confounded." He was "the weeping philosopher."

Here let me add Henry Nelson Coleridge's remarks on the Greek seed-plot
of those philosophies which were begotten of the Egyptian mysteries, and
which our author regards as, in turn, engendering "all heresies," when
once their leaders felt, like Simon Magus, a power in the Gospel of
which they were jealous, and of which they wished to make use without
submitting to its yoke. "Bishop Warburton," says Henry Nelson Coleridge,
"discovered, perhaps, more ingenuity than sound judgment in his views of
the nature of the Greek mysteries; entertaining a general opinion that
their ultimate object was to teach the initiated a pure theism, and to
inculcate the certainty and the importance of a future state of rewards
and punishments. I am led by the arguments of Villoison and Ste. Croix
to doubt the accuracy of this." In short, he supposes a "pure
pantheism," or *Spinosism*, the substance of their
teaching.<sup>[90](footnote/fn25.htm#P2557_838577.md)</sup>

VIII

Imagine themselves to be disciples of Christ, p. 126.

This and the foregoing chapter offer us a most overwhelming testimony to
the independence of councils. In the late "Council of Sacristans" at the
Vatican, where truth perished, Pius IX. refused to all the bishops of
what he accounted "the Catholic universe" what the seven suburbicarian
bishops were able to enforce as a right, in the primitive age, against
two successive Bishops of Rome, who were patrons of heresy. These
heretical prelates persisted; but the Province remained in communion
with the other apostolic provinces, while rejecting all communion with
them. All this will help us in studying Cyprian's treatise *On Unity*,
and it justifies his own conduct.

IX

The episcopal throne, p. 128.

The simple primitive
*cathedra*,<sup>[91](footnote/fn25.htm#P2566_839407.md)</sup> of which we
may learn something from the statue of Hippolytus, was, no doubt, "a
throne" in the eyes of an ambitious man. Callistus is here charged, by
one who knew him and his history, with obtaining this position by
knavish words and practices. The question may well arise, in our
Christian love for antiquity, How could such things be, even in the age
of martyrdoms? Let us recollect, that under the good Bishop Pius, when
his brother wrote the *Hermas*, the peril of wealth and love of money
began to be imminent at Rome. Tertullian testifies to the lax discipline
of that see when he was there. Minucius Felix lets us into the
impressions made by the Roman Christians upon surrounding heathen: they
were a set of conies burrowing in the earth; a "light-shunning people,"
lurking in the catacombs. And yet, while this fact shows plainly that
good men were not ambitious to come forth from these places of exile and
suffering, and expose themselves needlessly to death, it leads us to
comprehend how ambitious men, *studiosi novarum rerum*, could remain
above ground, conforming very little to the discipline of Christ, making
friends with the world, and yet using their nominal religion on the
principle that "gain is godliness." There were some wealthy Christians;
there were others, like Marcia in the palace, sufficiently awakened to
perceive their own wickedness, and anxious to do favours to the
persecuted flock, by way, perhaps, of compounding for sins not
renounced. And when we come to the Epistles of
Cyprian,<sup>[92](footnote/fn25.htm#P2567_840966.md)</sup> we shall see
what opportunities were given to desperate men to make themselves a sort
of brokers to the Christian community; for selfish ends helping them in
times of peril, and rendering themselves, to the less conscientious, a
medium for keeping on good terms with the magistrates. Such a character
was Callistus, one of "the grievous wolves" foreseen by St. Paul when he
exhorted his brethren night and day, with tears, to beware of them.How
he made himself Bishop of Rome, the holy Hippolytus sufficiently
explains.

X

Unskilled in ecclesiastical definitions, p. 128.

It has been sufficiently demonstrated by the learned Dollinger, than
whom a more competent and qualified witness could not be named, that the
late pontiff, Pius IX., was in this respect, as a bishop, very much like
Callistus. Moreover, his chief adviser and prime minister, Antonelli,
was notoriously Callistus over again; standing towards him in the same
relations which Callistus bore to Zephyrinus. Yet, by the bull
*Ineffabilis*, that pontiff has retrospectively clothed the definitions
of Zephyrinus and Callistus with *infallibility*; thus making himself
also a partaker in their heresies, and exposing himself to the
*anathemas* with which the Catholic councils overwhelmed his predecessor
Honorius and others. That at such a crisis the testimony of Hippolytus
should come to light, and supply a *reductio ad absurdum* to the late
papal definitions, may well excite such a recognition of divine
providence as Dr. Bunsen repeatedly suggests.

XI

All consented-we did not, p. 128.

The Edinburgh editor supposes that the use of the plural *we*, in this
place, is the official plural of a bishop. It has been already
explained, however, that he is speaking of the provincial bishops with
whom he withstood Callistus when the *plebs* were carried away by his
hypocrisy. In England, bishops in certain cases, are a "corporation
sole; "and, as such, the plural is legal phraseology. All bishops,
however, use the plural in certain documents, as identifying themselves
with the universal episcopate, on the Cyprianic principle-*Episcopatus
unus est*, etc.

In Acts 5:13 is a passage which may be somewhat explained, perhaps, by
this: "*All* consented ... *we* did not." The *plebs* joined themselves
to the apostles; "but of *the rest* durst no man join himself to them:
howbeit, the *plebs* magnified them, and believers were added," etc.
"The rest" (tw=n de koipw=n) here means the priests, the Pharisees, and
Sadducees, the classes who were not the *plebs*, as appears by what
immediately follows.<sup>[93](footnote/fn25.htm#P2577_843542.md)</sup>

XII

Our condemnatory sentence, p. 131.

Again: Hippolytus refers to the action of the *suburbicarian* bishops in
provincial council. And here is the place to express dissatisfaction
with the apologetic tone of some writers, who seem to think Hippolytus
too severe, etc. As if, in dealing with such "wolves in sheep's
clothing," this faithful leader could show himself a true shepherd
without emphasis and words of abhorrence. Hippolytus has left to the
Church the impress of his
character<sup>[94](footnote/fn25.htm#P2582_844040.md)</sup> as
"superlatively sweet and amiable." Such was St. John, the beloved
disciple; but he was not less a "son of thunder." Our Divine Master was
"the Lamb," and "the Lion; "the author of the *Beatitudes*, and the
author of those terrific *woes*; the "meek and gentle friend of
publicans and sinners," and the "lash of small cords" upon the backs of
those who made His Father's house a "den of thieves." Such was
Chrysostom, such was Athanasius, such was St. Paul, and such have ever
been the noblest of mankind; tender and considerate, gentle and full of
compassion; but not less resolute, in the *crises* of history, in
withstanding iniquity in the persons of arch-enemies of truth, and
setting the brand upon their foreheads. Good men, who hate strife, and
love study and quiet, and to be friendly with others; men who never
permit themselves to indulge a personal enmity, or to resent a personal
affront; men who forgive injuries to the last farthing when they only
are concerned,-may yet crucify their natures in withstanding evil when
they are protecting Christ's flock, or fulfilling the command to
"contend earnestly for the faith once delivered to the saints." What the
Christian Church owes to the loving spirit of Hippolytus in the awful
emergencies of his times, protecting the poor sheep, and grappling with
wolves for their sake, the Last Day will fully declare. But let us who
know nothing of such warfare concede nothing, in judging of his spirit,
to the spirit of our unbelieving age, which has no censures except for
the defenders of truth :-

As shallow streams run dimpling all the way."

*Bon Dieu, bon diable*, as the French say, is the creed of the times.
Every one who insults the faith of Christians, who betrays truths he was
sworn to defend, who washes his hands but then gives Christ over to be
crucified, must be treated with especial favour. Christ is good: so is
Pilate; and Judas must not be censured. My soul be with Hippolytus when
the great Judge holds his assize. His eulogy is in the psalm
:<sup>[95](footnote/fn25.htm#P2586_846113.md)</sup> "Then stood up
Phinehas, and executed judgment: and *so* the plague was stayed.And that
was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations, for
evermore."

XIII

As if he had not sinned, p. 131.

There is an ambiguity in the facts as given in the Edinburgh edition, of
which it is hard to relieve the text. The word kaqi/stasqai is rendered
*to retain* (their places) in the first instance, as if the case were
all one with the second instance, where me/nein is justly rendered *to
continue*. The second case seems, then, to cover all the ground. What
need to speak of men "twice or thrice married," if a man *once* married,
after ordination is not to be retained? The word *retained* is
questionable in the first instance; and I have adopted Wordsworth's
reading, *to be enrolled*, which is doubtless the sense.

This statement of our author lends apparent countenance to the antiquity
of the "Apostolic Constitutions," so called. Perhaps Hippolytus really
supposed them to be apostolic. By Canon XVII. of that collection, a man
twice married, after baptism cannot be "on the sacerdotal list at all."
By Canon XXVI., an unmarried person once admitted to the clergy cannot
be permitted to marry. These are the two cases referred to by our
author. In the Greek churches this rule holds to this day; and the
Council of Nice refused to prohibit the married clergy to live in that
holy estate, while allowing the *traditional discipline* which
Hippolytus had in view in speaking of a violation of the twenty-sixth
*traditional* canon as a sin. As Bingham has remarked, however, canons
of discipline may be relaxed when not resting on fundamental and
scriptural laws.

XIV

Attempt to call themselves a Catholic Church, p. 131

The *Callistians*, it seems, became a heretical sect, and yet presumed
to call themselves a "Catholic Church." Yet this sect, while Callistus
lived, was in full communion with the Bishop of Rome. Such communion,
then, was no test of Catholicity. Observe the enormous crimes of which
this *lawless one* was guilty; he seems to antedate the age of
Theodora's popes and Marozia's, and what Hippolytus would have said of
them is not doubtful. It is remarkable that he employed St. Paul's
expression, however, o9 a
!nomoj,<sup>[96](footnote/fn25.htm#P2596_848350.md)</sup> "that wicked" or
that "lawless one," seeing, in such a bishop, what St. Gregory did in
another,-"a forerunner of the Antichrist."

XV

*Callistians*, p. 131.

Bunsen remarks that Theodoret speaks of this
sect<sup>[97](footnote/fn26.htm#P2601_848572.md)</sup> under the head of
the "Noetians." Wordsworth quotes as follows: "Callistus *took the lead*
in propagating this heresy after Noetus, and *devised certain additions*
to the impiety of the doctrine." In other words, he was not merely a
heretic, but himself a *heresiarch*. He gives the whole passage
textually,<sup>[98](footnote/fn26.htm#P2602_848945.md)</sup> and institutes
interesting parallelisms between the *Philosophumena* and Theodoret, who
used our author, and boldly borrowed from him.

XVI

The cause of all things, p. 150.

When one looks at the infinite variety of opinions, phrases, ideas, and
the like, with which the heresies of three centuries threatened to
obscure, defile, and destroy the revelations of Holy Scripture, who can
but wonder at the miracle of orthodoxy? Note with what fidelity the good
fight of faith was maintained, the *depositum* preserved, and the Gospel
epitomized at last in the Nicaeno-Constantinopolitan definitions, which
Professor Shedd, as I have previously noted, declares to be the accepted
confession of all the reformed, reputed orthodox, as well as of Greeks
and Latins. Let us not be surprised, that, during these conflicts, truth
on such mysterious subjects was reflected from good men's minds with
slight variations of expression. Rather behold the *miracle* of their
essential agreement, and of their entire harmony in the *Great Symbol*,
universally accepted as the testimony of the ante-Nicene witnesses. The
Word was Himself the cause of all created things; Himself increate; His
eternal generation implied in the eternity of His existence and His
distinct personality.

XVII

Tartarus, p. 153.

I am a little surprised at the innocent statement of the learned
translator, that "Dr. Wordsworth justifies Hippolytus' use of this
word." It must have occurred to every student of the Greek Testament
that *St. Peter* justifies this use in the passage quoted by Wordsworth,
which one would think must be self-suggested to any theologian reading
our author's text. In short, Hippolytus *quotes* the second Epistle of
St. Peter<sup>[99](footnote/fn26.htm#P2611_850670)</sup> (2 Peter 2:4.md)
when he uses this otherwise startling word. Josephus also employs
it;<sup>[100](footnote/fn26.htm#P2612_850898.md)</sup> it was familiar to
the Jews, and the apostle had no scruple in adopting a word which proves
the Gentile world acquainted with a Gehenna as well as a Sheol.

XVIII

For Christ is the God, p. 153.

Dr. Wordsworth justly censures Bunsen for his rendering of this
passage,<sup>[101](footnote/fn26.htm#P2617_851197.md)</sup> also for
manufacturing for Hippolytus a "Confession of Faith" out of his tenth
book.<sup>[102](footnote/fn26.htm#P2618_851330.md)</sup> I must refer the
student to that all-important chapter in Dr. Wordsworth's work (cap.
xi.) on the "Development of Christian Doctrine." It is masterly, as
against Dr. Newman, as well; and the respectful justice which he renders
at the same time to Dr. Bunsen is worthy of all admiration. Let it be
noted, that, while one must be surprised by the ready command of
literary and theological materials which the learned doctor and
chevalier brings into instantaneous use for his work, it is hardly less
surprising, in spite of all that, that he was willing to throw off his
theories and strictures, without any delay, during the confusions of
that memorable year 1851, when I had the honour of meeting him among
London notabilities. He says to his "dearest friend, Archdeacon Hare,
... Dr. Tregelles informed me *last week* of the appearance of the work
(of Hippolytus) ... I procured a copy in consequence, and perused it *as
soon as I could*; and I have already arrived at conclusions which seem
to me so evident that I feel no hesitation in expressing them to you at
once." These conclusions were creditable to his *acumen* and learning in
general; eminently so. But the theories he had so hastily conceived, in
other particulars, crop out in so many crudities of theological caprice,
that nobody should try to study his theoretical opinions without the aid
of that calm reviewal they have received from Dr. Wordsworth's ripe and
sober scholarship and well-balanced intellect.

General Note.

I avail myself of a little spare space to add, from Michelet's friend,
E. Quinet,<sup>[103](footnote/fn26.htm#P2622_852918.md)</sup> the passage
to which I have made a reference on p. 156. Let me say, however, that
Quinet and Michelet are specimens of that intellectual revolt against
Roman dogma which is all but universal in Europe in our day, and of
which the history of M. Renan is a melancholy exposition. To Quinet,
with all his faults, belongs the credit of having more thoroughly
understood than any theological writer the absolute revolution created
by the Council of Trent; and he justly remarks that the Jesuits showed
their address "in making this revolution, *without anywhere speaking of
it*." Hence a dull world has not observed it. Contrasting this
pseudo-council with the free councils of antiquity, M. Quinet says: "The
Council of Trent has not its roots in all nations; it does not assemble
about it the representatives of all nations ... *omni plebe adstante*,
according to the ancient formula ... The East and the North are, almost
equally, wanting; and *this is why the king of France refused it the
title of a council*." He quotes noble passages from
Bossuet.<sup>[104](footnote/fn26.htm#P2623_854060.md)</sup>
