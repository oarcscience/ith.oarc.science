##  Epistle LX.<sup>[1](footnote/fn59.htm#P5912_1855457.md)</sup> To Euchratius, About an Actor.

1\. Cyprian to Euchratius his brother, greeting. From our mutual love
and your reverence for me you have thought that I should be consulted,
dearest brother, as to my opinion concerning a certain actor, who, being
settled among you, still persists in the discredit of the same art of
his; and as a master and teacher, not for the instruction, but for the
destruction of boys, that which he has unfortunately learnt he also
imparts to others: you ask whether such a one ought to communicate with
us. This, I think, neither befits the divine majesty nor the discipline
of the Gospel, that the modesty and credit of the Church should be
polluted by so disgraceful and infamous a contagion. For since, in the
law, men are forbidden to put on a woman's garment, and those that
offend in this manner are judged accursed, how much greater is the
crime, not only to take women's garments, but also to express base and
effeminate and luxurious gestures, by the teaching of an immodest art.

2\. Nor let any one excuse himself that he himself has given up the
theatre, while he is still teaching the art to others. For he cannot
appear to have given it up who substitutes others in his place, and who,
instead of himself alone, supplies many in his stead; against God's
appointment, instructing and teaching in what way a man may be broken
down into a woman, and his sex changed by
art,<sup>[2](footnote/fn59.htm#P5917_1857383.md)</sup> and how the devil
who pollutes the divine image may be gratified by the sins of a
corrupted and enervated body. But if such a one alleges poverty and the
necessity of small means, his necessity also can be assisted among the
rest who are maintained by the support of the Church; if he be content,
that is, with very frugal but innocent food. And let him not think that
he is redeemed by an allowance to cease from sinning, since this is an
advantage not to us, but to himself. What more he may wish he must seek
thence, from such gain as takes men away from the banquet of Abraham,
and Isaac, and Jacob, and leads them down, sadly and perniciously
fattened in this world, to the eternal torments of hunger and thirst;
and therefore, as far as you can, recall him from this depravity and
disgrace to the way of innocence, and to the hope of eternal life, that
he may be content with the maintenance of the Church, sparing indeed,
but wholesome. But if the Church with you is not sufficient for this, to
afford support for those in need, he may transfer himself to us, and
here receive what may be necessary to him for food and clothing, and not
teach deadly things to others without the Church, but himself learn
wholesome things in the Church. I bid you, dearest brother, ever
heartily farewell.
