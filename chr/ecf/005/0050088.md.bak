##  Epistle LXIII.<sup>[1](footnote/fn60.htm#P6023_1898323.md)</sup>

To Epictetus and to the Congregation of Assurae, Concerning
Fortunatianus, Formerly Their Bishop.

1\. Cyprian to Epictetus his brother, and to the people established at
Assurae, greeting. I was gravely and grievously disturbed, dearest
brethren, at learning that Fortunatianus, formerly bishop among you,
after the sad lapse of his fall, was now wishing to act as if he were
sound, and beginning to claim for himself the episcopate. Which thing
distressed me; in the first place, on his own account, who, wretched man
that he is, being either wholly blinded in the darkness of the devil, or
deceived by the sacrilegious persuasion of certain persons; when he
ought to be making atonement, and to give himself to the work of
entreating the Lord night and day, by tears, and supplications, and
prayers, dares still to claim to himself the priesthood which he has
betrayed, as if it were right, from the altars of the devil, to approach
to the altar of God. Or as if he would not provoke a greater wrath and
indignation of the Lord against himself in the day of judgment, who, not
being able to be a guide to the brethren in faith and virtue, stands
forth as a teacher in perfidy, in boldness, and in temerity; and he who
has not taught the brethren to stand bravely in the battle, teaches
those who are conquered and prostrate not even to ask *for pardon*;
although the Lord says, "To them have ye poured a drink-offering, and to
them have ye offered a meat-offering. Shall I not be angry for these
things? saith the Lord."<sup>[2](footnote/fn60.htm#P6028_1900156.md)</sup>
And in another place, "He that sacrificeth to any god, save unto the
Lord only, shall be
destroyed."<sup>[3](footnote/fn60.htm#P6029_1900274.md)</sup> Moreover, the
Lord again speaks, and says, "They have worshipped those whom their own
fingers have made: and the mean man boweth down, and the great man
humbleth himself: and I will not forgive
them."<sup>[4](footnote/fn60.htm#P6030_1900492.md)</sup> In the Apocalypse
also, we read the anger of the Lord threatening, and saying, "If any man
worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead or
in his hand, the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God mixed
in the cup of His anger; and he shall be tormented with fire and
brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the
Lamb: and the smoke of their torments shall ascend up for ever and ever;
neither shall they have rest day nor night, who worship the beast and
his image."<sup>[5](footnote/fn60.htm#P6031_1901039.md)</sup>

2\. Since, therefore, the Lord threatens these torments, these
punishments in the day of judgment, to those who obey the devil and
sacrifice to idols, how does he think that he can act as a priest of God
who has obeyed and served the priests of the devil; or how does he think
that his hand can be transferred to the sacrifice of God and the prayer
of the Lord which has been captive to sacrilege and to crime, when in
the sacred Scriptures God forbids the priests to approach to sacrifice
even if they have been in lighter guilt; and says in Leviticus: "The man
in whom there shall be any blemish or stain shall not approach to offer
gifts to God? "<sup>[6](footnote/fn60.htm#P6033_1901709.md)</sup> Also in
Exodus: "And let the priests which come near to the Lord God sanctify
themselves, lest perchance the Lord forsake
them."<sup>[7](footnote/fn60.htm#P6034_1901855.md)</sup> And again: "And
when they come near to minister at the altar of the Holy One, they shall
not bring sin upon them, lest they
die."<sup>[8](footnote/fn60.htm#P6035_1902001.md)</sup> Those, therefore,
who have brought grievous sins upon themselves, that is, who, by
sacrificing to idols, have offered sacrilegious sacrifices, cannot claim
to themselves the priesthood of God, nor make any prayer for their
brethren in His sight; since it is written in the Gospel, "God heareth
not a sinner; but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth His will,
him He heareth."<sup>[9](footnote/fn60.htm#P6036_1902404.md)</sup>
Nevertheless the profound gloom of the falling darkness has so blinded
the hearts of some, that they receive no light from the wholesome
precepts, but, once turned away from the direct path of the true way,
they are hurried headlong and suddenly by the night and error of their
sins.<sup>[10](footnote/fn60.htm#P6037_1902705.md)</sup>

3\. Nor is it wonderful if now those reject our counsels, or the Lord's
precepts, who have denied the Lord. They desire gifts, and offerings,
and gain, for which formerly they watched insatiably. They still long
also for suppers and banquets, whose debauch they belched forth in the
indigestion lately left to the day, most manifestly proving now that
they did not before serve religion, but rather their belly and gain,
with profane cupidity. Whence also we perceive and believe that this
rebuke has come from God's searching out, that they might not continue
to stand at the altar; and any further, as unchaste persons, to have to
do with modesty; as perfidious, to have to do with faith; as profane,
with religion; as earthly, with things divine; as sacrilegious, with
things sacred. That such persons may not return again to the profanation
of the altar, and to the contagion of the brethren, we must keep watch
with all our powers, and strive with all our strength, that, as far as
in us lies, we may keep them back from this audacity of their
wickedness, that they attempt not any longer to act in the character of
priest; who, cast down to the lowest pit of death, have gone headlong
with the weight of a greater destruction beyond the lapses of the laity.

4\. But if, among these insane persons, their incurable madness shall
continue, and, with the withdrawal of the Holy Spirit, the blindness
which has begun shall remain in its deep night, our counsel will be to
separate individual brethren from their deceitfulness; and, lest any one
should run into the toils of their error, to separate them from their
contagion. Since neither can the oblation be consecrated where the Holy
Spirit is not; nor can the Lord avail to any one by the prayers and
supplications of one who himself has done despite to the Lord. But if
Fortunatianus, either by the blindness induced by the devil forgetful of
his crime, or become a minister and servant of the devil for deceiving
the brotherhood, shall persevere in this his madness, do you, as far as
in you lies, strive, and in this darkness of the rage of the devil,
recall the minds of the brethren from error, that they may not easily
consent to the madness of another; that they may not make themselves
partakers in the crimes of abandoned men; but being sound, let them
maintain the constant tenor of their salvation, and of the integrity
preserved and guarded by
them.<sup>[11](footnote/fn60.htm#P6040_1905203.md)</sup>

5\. Let the lapsed, however, who acknowledge the greatness of their sin,
not depart from entreating the Lord, nor forsake the Catholic Church,
which has been appointed one and alone by the Lord; but, continuing in
their atonements and entreating the Lord's mercy, let them knock at the
*door of the* Church, that they may be received there where once they
were, and may return to Christ from whom they have departed, and not
listen to those who deceive them with a fallacious and deadly seduction;
since it is written, "Let no man deceive you with vain words, for
because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of
disobedience; be not ye therefore partakers with
them."<sup>[12](footnote/fn60.htm#P6042_1905984.md)</sup> Therefore let no
one associate himself with the contumacious, and those who do not fear
God, and those who entirely with draw from the Church. But if any one
should be impatient of entreating the Lord who is offended, and should
be unwilling to obey us, but should follow desperate and abandoned men,
he must take the blame to himself when the day of judgment shall come.
For how shall he be able in that day to entreat the Lord, who has both
before this denied Christ, and now also the Church of Christ, and not
obeying bishops sound and wholesome and living, has made himself an
associate and a partaker with the dying? I bid you, dearest brethren and
longed-for, ever heartily farewell.
