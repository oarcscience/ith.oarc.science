<span id="v.iii.xviii-p2"></span><span
id="v.iii.xviii-p2.1"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="v.iii.xviii-p2.2"></span>[1 Timothy vi.
2-7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#002.md)<span
id="v.iii.xviii-p2.3"></span></span>

<span id="v.iii.xviii-p3"></span>“These things teach and exhort. If any
man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, even the words
of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to
godliness; he is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and
strifes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil
surmisings, perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute
of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness: from such withdraw
thyself. But godliness with contentment is great gain. For we brought
nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out.”

<span id="v.iii.xviii-p4"></span><span class="c13"><span
id="v.iii.xviii-p4.1"></span>A teacher</span> has need not only of
authority, but of gentleness, and not only of gentleness, but of
authority. And all these the blessed Paul teaches, at one time saying,
“These things command and teach” ([1 Tim. iv.
11](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#011.md)<span
id="v.iii.xviii-p4.2"></span>.); at another, “These things teach and
exhort.” <span id="fr_1292"></span>[1293](#fn_1292.md) For if physicians
entreat the sick, not for the benefit of their own health, but that they
may relieve their sickness, and restore their prostrate strength, much
more ought we to observe this method, of entreating those whom we teach.
For the blessed Paul does not refuse to be their servant: “We preach not
ourselves,” he says; “but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your
servants for Jesus’ sake” ([2 Cor. iv.
5](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#005.md)<span
id="v.iii.xviii-p5.1"></span>.); and again, “All things are yours,
whether Paul or Apollos.” ([1 Cor. iii.
12](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#012.md)<span
id="v.iii.xviii-p5.2"></span>.) And in this service he serves with
alacrity, for it is not slavery, but superior to freedom. For He says,
“Whoever committeth sin is the servant of sin.” ([John viii.
34](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#034.md)<span
id="v.iii.xviii-p5.3"></span>.)

<span id="v.iii.xviii-p6"></span>“If any man teach otherwise, and
consent not to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ,
and to the doctrine which is according to godliness, he is proud,
knowing nothing.” Presumption therefore arises not from knowledge, but
from “knowing nothing.” For he that knows the doctrines of godliness is
also the most disposed to moderation. He who knows sound words, is not
unsound. For what inflammation is in the body, that pride is in the
soul. And as we do not in the first case say that the inflamed part is
sound, so neither do we here consider the arrogant. It is possible then
to be knowing, and yet to know nothing. For he that knows not what he
ought to know, knows nothing. And that pride arises from knowing nothing
is manifest from hence. Christ “made Himself of no reputation” ([Philip.
ii. 7](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#007.md)<span
id="v.iii.xviii-p6.1"></span>.), he therefore who knows this will not be
high-minded. Man hath nothing except from God, therefore he will not be
high-minded. “For what hast thou that thou didst not receive?” ([1 Cor.
iv. 7](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#007.md)<span
id="v.iii.xviii-p6.2"></span>.) He washed the feet of His disciples, how
can he who knows this be setting himself up? Therefore He says, “When ye
have done all, say we are unprofitable servants.” ([Luke xvii.
10](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#010.md)<span
id="v.iii.xviii-p6.3"></span>.) The publican was accepted only from his
humility, the Pharisee perished by his boastfulness. He who is puffed up
knoweth none of these things. Again, Christ Himself says, “If I have
spoken evil, bear witness of the evil; but if well, why smitest thou
me?” ([John xviii. 23](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#023.md)<span
id="v.iii.xviii-p6.4"></span>.)

<span id="v.iii.xviii-p7"></span>“Doting <span
id="fr_1293"></span>[1294](#fn_1293.md) about questions.” To question then
is to dote. “And strifes of words”; this is justly said. For when the
soul is fevered with reasonings, and stormy, then it questions, but when
it is in a sound state, it does not question, but receives the faith.
But from questionings and strifes of words nothing can be discovered.
For when the things which faith only promises are received by an
inquisitive spirit, it neither demonstrates them, nor suffers us to
understand them. If one should close his eyes, he would not be able to
find anything he sought: or if, again with his eyes open, he should bury
himself, and exclude the sun, he would be unable to find anything, thus
seeking. So without faith nothing can be discerned, but contentions must
needs arise. “Whereof come railings, evil surmisings”; that is,
erroneous opinions and doctrines arising froth questionings. For when we
begin to question, then we surmise concerning God things that we ought
not.

<span id="v.iii.xviii-p9"></span><span id="page_468">p. 468</span> <span
id="v.iii.xviii-Page_468"></span>“Perverse disputings,” <span
id="fr_1294"></span>[1295](#fn_1294.md) that is, leisure or conversation,
or he may mean intercommunication, and that as infected sheep by
contact <span id="fr_1295"></span>[1296](#fn_1295.md) communicate disease
to the sound, so do these bad men.

<span id="v.iii.xviii-p12"></span>“Destitute of the truth, thinking that
gain is godliness.” Observe what evils are produced by strifes of words.
The love of gain, ignorance, and pride; for pride is engendered by
ignorance.

<span id="v.iii.xviii-p13"></span>“From such withdraw thyself.” He does
not say, engage and contend with them, but “withdraw thyself,” turn away
from them; as elsewhere he says, “A man that is an heretic after the
first and second admonition reject.” ([Tit. iii.
10](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#010.md)<span
id="v.iii.xviii-p13.1"></span>.) He shows that they do not so much err
from ignorance, as they owe their ignorance to their indolence. Those
who are contentious for the sake of money you will never persuade. They
are only to be persuaded, so long as you give, and even so you will
never satisfy their desires. For it is said, “The covetous man’s eye is
not satisfied with a portion.” ([Ecclesiasticus
14.9](../../../bib/apo/sir014.htm#009.md)<span
id="v.iii.xviii-p13.2"></span>.) From such then, as being incorrigible,
it is right to turn away. And if he who had much obligation to fight for
the truth, is advised not to engage in contention with such men, much
more should we <span id="fr_1296"></span>[1297](#fn_1296.md) avoid it, who
are in the situation of disciples.

<span id="v.iii.xviii-p15"></span>Having said, “They think that
godliness is a means of gain,” he adds: “But godliness with contentment
is great gain,” not when it possesses wealth, but when it has it not.
For that he may not despond on account of his poverty, he encourages and
revives his spirit. They think, he says, that godliness is a means of
gain, <span id="fr_1297"></span>[1298](#fn_1297.md) and so it is; only not
in their way, but in a much higher. Then having demolished theirs he
extols the other. For that worldly gain is nothing, is manifest, because
it is left behind, and does not attend us, or go along with us at our
departure. Whence is this plain? Because we had nothing when we came
into this world, therefore we shall have nothing when we depart from it.
For nature came naked into the world, and naked she will go out of it.
Therefore we want no superfluities; if we brought nothing with us, and
shall take nothing away with us.

<span id="v.iii.xviii-p17"></span>[1 Tim.
6.8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#008.md)<span
id="v.iii.xviii-p17.1"></span>. “And having food and raiment, let us be
therewith content.”

<span id="v.iii.xviii-p18"></span>Such things, and so much ought we to
eat, as will suffice to nourish us, and such things should we put on, as
will cover us, and clothe our nakedness, and nothing more; and a common
garment will answer this purpose. Then he urges them from the
consideration of things here, saying,

<span id="v.iii.xviii-p19"></span>[1 Tim.
6.9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#009.md)<span
id="v.iii.xviii-p19.1"></span>. “But they that will be rich”; not those
that are rich, but those who wish to be. For a man may have money and
make a good use of it, not overvaluing it, but bestowing it upon the
poor. Such therefore he does not blame, but the covetous.

<span id="v.iii.xviii-p20"></span>“They that will be rich fall into
temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which
drown men in destruction and perdition.”

<span id="v.iii.xviii-p21"></span>He has justly said, “they drown men,”
since they cannot be raised from that depth. “In destruction and
perdition.”

<span id="v.iii.xviii-p22"></span>[1 Tim.
6.10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#010.md)<span
id="v.iii.xviii-p22.1"></span>. “For the love of money is the root of
all evil; which while some coveted after, they have erred from the
faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.”

<span id="v.iii.xviii-p23"></span>Two things he mentions, and that which
to them might seem the more weighty he places last, their “many
sorrows.” And to learn how true this is, the only way is to sojourn with
the rich, to see how many are their sorrows, how bitter their
complaints.

<span id="v.iii.xviii-p24"></span>[1 Tim.
6.11](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#011.md)<span
id="v.iii.xviii-p24.1"></span>. “But thou, O man of God.”

<span id="v.iii.xviii-p25"></span>This is a title of great dignity. For
we are all men of God, but the righteous peculiarly so, not by right of
creation only, but by that of appropriation. <span
id="fr_1298"></span>[1299](#fn_1298.md) If then thou art a “man of God,”
seek not superfluous things, which lead thee not to God, but

<span id="v.iii.xviii-p27"></span>“Flee these things, and follow after
righteousness.” Both expressions are emphatic; he does not say turn from
one, and approach the other, but “flee these things, pursue
righteousness,” so as not to be covetous.

<span id="v.iii.xviii-p28"></span>“Godliness,” that is, soundness in
doctrines. <span id="fr_1299"></span>[1300](#fn_1299.md)

<span id="v.iii.xviii-p30"></span>“Faith,” which is opposed to
questionings.

<span id="v.iii.xviii-p31"></span>“Love,” patience, meekness.

<span id="v.iii.xviii-p32"></span>[1 Tim.
6.12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#012.md)<span
id="v.iii.xviii-p32.1"></span>. “Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold
on eternal life.” Lo, there is thy reward, “whereunto thou art also
called, and hast professed a good profession,” in hope of eternal life,
“before many witnesses.”

<span id="v.iii.xviii-p33"></span>That is, do not put that confidence to
shame. Why dost thou labor to no profit? But what is the “temptation and
snare,” which he says, those that would be rich fall into? It causes
them to err from the faith, it involves them in dangers, it renders them
less intrepid. “Foolish desires,” he says. And is it not a foolish
desire, when men like to keep idiots and dwarfs, not from benevolent
motives, but for their pleasure, when they have receptacles for fishes
in their halls, when they bring up wild beasts, when they give their
time to dogs, and dress up horses, and are as fond of them as of their
chil<span id="page_469">p. 469</span> <span
id="v.iii.xviii-Page_469"></span>dren? All these things are foolish and
superfluous, nowise necessary, nowise useful.

<span id="v.iii.xviii-p34"></span>“Foolish and hurtful lusts!” What are
hurtful lusts? When men live unlawfully, when they desire what is their
neighbor’s, when they do their utmost in <span
id="fr_1300"></span>[1301](#fn_1300.md) luxury, when they long for
drunkenness, when they desire the murder and destruction of others. From
these desires many have aimed at tyranny, and perished. Surely to labor
with such views is both foolish and hurtful. And well has he said, “They
have erred from the faith.” Covetousness attracting their eyes to
herself, and gradually stealing away their minds, suffers them not to
see their way. For as one walking on the straight road, with his mind
intent on something else, proceeds on his way indeed, but, often without
knowing it, passes by the very city to which he was hastening, his feet
plying on at random and to no purpose: such like a thing is
covetousness. “They have pierced themselves through with many sorrows.”
Dost thou see what he means by that word “pierced”? What he means to
express by the allusion <span id="fr_1301"></span>[1302](#fn_1301.md) is
this. Desires are thorns, and as when one touches thorns, he gores his
hand, and gets him wounds, so he that falls into these lusts will be
wounded by them, and pierce his soul with griefs. And what cares and
troubles attend those who are thus pierced, it is not possible to
express. Therefore he says, “Flee these things, and follow after
righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.” For meekness
springs from love.

<span id="v.iii.xviii-p37"></span>[1 Tim.
6.12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#012.md)<span
id="v.iii.xviii-p37.1"></span>. “Fight the good fight.”

<span id="v.iii.xviii-p38"></span>Here he commends his boldness and
manliness, that before all he confidently “made profession,” and he
reminds him of his early instruction.

<span id="v.iii.xviii-p39"></span>“Lay hold on eternal life.”

<span id="v.iii.xviii-p40"></span>There is need not only of profession,
but of patience also to persevere in that profession, and of vehement
contention, and of numberless toils, that you be not overthrown. For
many are the stumbling-blocks, and impediments, therefore the way is
“strait and narrow.” ([Matt. vii.
14](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#014.md)<span
id="v.iii.xviii-p40.1"></span>.) It is necessary therefore to be
self-collected, <span id="fr_1302"></span>[1303](#fn_1302.md) and well girt
on every side. All around appear pleasures attracting the eyes of the
soul. Those of beauty, of wealth, of luxury, of indolence, of glory, of
revenge, of power, of dominion, and these are all fair and lovely in
appearance, and able to captivate those who are unsteady, and who do not
love the truth. For truth has but a severe and uninviting countenance.
And why? Because the pleasures that she promises are all future, whereas
the others hold out present honors and delights, and repose; though all
are false and counterfeit. To these therefore adhere gross, effeminate,
unmanly minds, indisposed to the toils of virtue. As in the games of the
heathens, he who does not earnestly covet the crown, may from the first
give himself up to revellings and drunkenness, and so do in fact the
cowardly and unmanly combatants, whilst those who look steadfastly to
the crown sustain blows without number. For they are supported and
roused to action by the hope of future reward.

<span id="v.iii.xviii-p42"></span><span class="c13"><span
id="v.iii.xviii-p42.1"></span>Moral.</span> Let us then flee from this
root of all evils, and we shall escape them all. “The love of money,” he
says, “is the root;” thus says Paul, or rather Christ by Paul, and let
us see how this is. The actual experience of the world testifies it. For
what evil is not caused by wealth, or rather not by wealth, but by the
wicked will of those who know not how to use it? For it is possible to
use wealth in well doing, and even through means of it to inherit the
kingdom. But now what was given us for the relief of the poor, to make
amends for our past sins, to win a good report, and to please God, this
we employ against the poor and wretched, or rather against our own
souls, and to the high displeasure of God. For as for the other, a man
robs him of his wealth, and reduces him to poverty, but himself to
death; and him he causes to pine in penury here, but himself in that
eternal punishment. Are they equal sufferers, think you?

<span id="v.iii.xviii-p43"></span>What evils then does it not cause!
what fraudulent practices, what robberies! what miseries, enmities,
contentions, battles! Does it not stretch forth its hand even to the
dead, nay, to fathers, and brethren? Do not they who are possessed by
this passion violate the laws of nature, and the commandments of God? in
short everything? Is it not this that renders our courts of justice
necessary? Take away therefore the love of money, and you put an end to
war, to battle, to enmity, to strife and contention. Such men ought
therefore to be banished from the world, as wolves and pests. For as
opposing and violent winds, sweeping over a calm sea, stir it up from
its foundations, and mingle the sands of the deep with the waves above,
so the lovers of wealth confound and unsettle everything. The covetous
man never knows a friend: a friend, did I say? he knows not God Himself,
driven mad, as he is, by the passion of avarice. Do ye not see the
Titans going forth sword in hand? This is a representation of madness.
But the lovers of money do not counterfeit, they are really mad, and
beside themselves; and if you could lay bare their souls, you would find
them armed in this way not with one or two swords, but with thousands,
<span id="page_470">p. 470</span> <span
id="v.iii.xviii-Page_470"></span>acknowledging no one, but turning their
rage against all; flying and snarling at all, slaughtering not
dogs, <span id="fr_1303"></span>[1304](#fn_1303.md) but the souls of men,
and uttering blasphemies against heaven itself. By these men all things
are subverted, and ruined by their madness after wealth.

<span id="v.iii.xviii-p45"></span>For whom indeed, whom I should accuse,
I know not! It is a plague that so seizes all, some more, some less, but
all in a degree. Like a fire catching a wood, that desolates and
destroys all around, this passion has laid waste the world. Kings,
magistrates, private persons, the poor, women, men, children, are all
alike affected by it. As if a gross darkness had overspread the earth,
no one is in his sober senses. Yet we hear, both in public and private,
many declamations <span id="fr_1304"></span>[1305](#fn_1304.md) against
covetousness, but no one is mended by them.

<span id="v.iii.xviii-p47"></span>What then is to be done? How shall we
extinguish this flame? For though it has risen up to heaven itself, it
is to be extinguished. We have only to be willing, and we shall be able
to master the conflagration. For as by our will it has got head, so it
may be brought under by our will. Did not our own choice cause it, and
will not the same choice avail to extinguish it? Only let us be willing.
But how shall that willingness be engendered? If we consider the vanity
and the unprofitableness of wealth, that it cannot depart hence with us,
that even here it forsakes us, and that whilst it remains behind, it
inflicts upon us wounds that depart along with us. If we see that there
are riches There, compared to which the wealth of this world is more
despicable than dung. If we consider that it is attended with numberless
dangers, with pleasure that is temporary, pleasure mingled with sorrow.
If we contemplate aright the true riches of eternal life, we shall be
able to despise worldly wealth. If we remember that it profits nothing
either to glory, or health, or any other thing; but on the contrary
drowns men in destruction and perdition. If thou consider that here thou
art rich, and hast many under thee, but that when thou departest hence,
thou wilt go naked and solitary. If we often represent <span
id="fr_1305"></span>[1306](#fn_1305.md) these things to ourselves, and
listen to them from others, there will perhaps be a return to a sound
mind, and a deliverance from this dreadful punishment.

<span id="v.iii.xviii-p49"></span>Is a pearl beautiful? yet consider, it
is but sea water, and was once cast away in the bosom of the deep. Are
gold and silver beautiful? yet they were and are but dust and ashes. Are
silken vestments beautiful? yet they are nothing but the spinning of
worms. This beauty is but in opinion, in human prejudice, not in the
nature of the things. For that which possesses beauty from nature, need
not any to point it out. If you see a coin of brass that is but gilded
over, yon admire it at first, fancying that it is gold; but when the
cheat is shown to you by one who understands it, your wonder vanishes
with the deceit. The beauty therefore was not in the nature of the
thing. Neither is it in silver; you may admire tin for silver, as you
admired brass for gold, and you need some one to inform you what you
should admire. Thus our eyes are not sufficient to discern the
difference. It is not so with flowers, which are much more beautiful. If
you see a rose, you need no one to inform you, you can of yourself
distinguish an anemone, and a violet, or a lily, and every other flower.
It is nothing therefore but prejudice. And to show, that this
destructive passion is but a prejudice; tell me, if the Emperor were
pleased to ordain that silver should be of more value than gold, would
you not transfer your love and admiration to the former? Thus we are
everywhere under the influence of covetousness and opinion. <span
id="fr_1306"></span>[1307](#fn_1306.md) And that it is so, and that a thing
is valued for its rarity, and not for its nature, appears hence. The
fruits that are held cheap among us are in high esteem among the
Cappadocians, and among the Serians <span
id="fr_1307"></span>[1308](#fn_1307.md) even more valuable than the most
precious among us, from which country these garments are brought; and
many such instances might be given in Arabia and India, where spices are
produced, and where precious stones are found. Such preference therefore
is nothing but prejudice, and human opinion. We act not from judgment,
but at random, and as accident determines. But let us recover from this
intoxication, let us fix our view upon that which is truly beautiful,
beautiful in its own nature, upon godliness and righteousness; that we
may obtain the promised blessings, through the grace and lovingkindness
of Jesus Christ our Lord, with whom, &c.
