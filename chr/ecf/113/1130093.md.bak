<span id="v.iii.i-p7"></span>————————————

<span id="v.iii.i-p8"></span><span class="c10"><span
id="v.iii.i-p8.1"></span>Argument.</span>

<span id="v.iii.i-p9"></span>1. <span class="c16"><span
id="v.iii.i-p9.1"></span>Timothy</span> too <span
id="fr_1079"></span>[1080](#fn_1079.md) was one of the disciples of the
Apostle Paul. To the extraordinary qualities of this youth testimony is
borne by Luke, who informs us, that he was “well reported of by the
brethren that were at Lystra and Iconium.” ([Acts xvi.
2](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#002)<span id="v.iii.i-p10.2"></span>..md) He
became at once a disciple and a teacher, and gave this singular instance
of his prudence, that hearing Paul preach without insisting upon
circumcision, and understanding that he had formerly withstood Peter
upon that point, he chose not only not to preach against it, but to
submit to that rite. For Paul, it is said, “took and circumcised him”
([Acts xvi. 3](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#003.md)<span
id="v.iii.i-p10.3"></span>.), though he was of adult age, and so trusted
him with his whole economy. <span id="fr_1080"></span>[1081](#fn_1080.md)

<span id="v.iii.i-p12"></span>The affection of Paul for him is a
sufficient evidence of his character. For he elsewhere says of him, “Ye
know the proof of him, that as a son with a father, he hath served with
me in the Gospel.” ([Philip. ii.
22](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#022)<span id="v.iii.i-p12.1"></span>..md)
And to the Corinthians again he writes: “I have sent unto you Timothy,
who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord.” ([1 Cor. iv.
17](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#017)<span id="v.iii.i-p12.2"></span>..md)
And again: “Let no man despise him, for he worketh the work of the Lord,
as I also do.” ([1 Cor. 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#010.md),
[11](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#011)<span id="v.iii.i-p12.3"></span>..md)
And to the Hebrews he writes, “Know that our brother Timothy is set at
liberty.” ([Heb. xiii. 23](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#023.md)<span
id="v.iii.i-p12.4"></span>.) Indeed his love for him is everywhere
apparent, and the miracles <span id="fr_1081"></span>[1082](#fn_1081.md)
that are now wrought still attest his claims. <span
id="fr_1082"></span>[1083](#fn_1082.md)

<span id="v.iii.i-p15"></span>2. If it should be asked why he addresses
Epistles to Titus and Timothy alone, though Silas was approved, as also
was Luke, for he writes, “Only Luke is with me” ([2 Tim. iv.
11](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#011)<span id="v.iii.i-p15.1"></span>..md),
and Clement was one of his associates, of whom he says, “with Clement
and other my fellow-laborers” ([Philip. iv.
3](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#003)<span id="v.iii.i-p15.2"></span>..md),
for what reason then does he write only to Titus and Timothy? It is
because he had already committed the care of churches to these, and
certain marked <span id="fr_1083"></span>[1084](#fn_1083.md) places had
been assigned to them, but the others were in attendance upon him. For
so preëminent in virtue was Timothy, that his youth was no impediment to
his promotion; therefore he writes, “Let no man despise thy youth” ([1
Tim. 4:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#012.md), [1 Tim.
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#002)<span id="v.iii.i-p16.2"></span>..md);
and again, “The younger women as sisters.” <span
id="fr_1084"></span>[1085](#fn_1084.md) For where there is virtue, all
other things are superfluous, and there can be no impediment. Therefore
when the Apostle discourses of Bishops, among the many things he
requires of them, he makes no particular mention of age. And if he
speaks of a Bishop “being the husband of one wife,” and “having his
children in subjection” ([1 Tim. 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#002.md),
[4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#004)<span id="v.iii.i-p17.1"></span>..md),
this is not said, as if it were necessary he should have a wife and
children; but that if any should <span id="page_408">p. 408</span> <span
id="v.iii.i-Page_408"></span>happen from a secular life to be advanced
to that office, they might be such as knew how to preside over their
household and children, and all others committed to them. For if a man
were both secular and deficient in these points, how should he be <span
id="fr_1085"></span>[1086](#fn_1085.md) intrusted with the care of the
Church?

<span id="v.iii.i-p19"></span>3. But why, you will say, does he address
an Epistle to a disciple already appointed to the office of a Teacher?
Ought he not to have been made perfect for his office, before he was
sent? Yes; but the instruction which he needed was not that which was
suited to a disciple, but that which was proper for a Teacher. You will
perceive him therefore through the whole Epistle adapting his
instructions to a Teacher. Thus at the very beginning he does not say,
“Do not attend to those who teach otherwise,” but, “Charge them that
they teach no other doctrine.” ([1 Tim. i.
3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#003)<span id="v.iii.i-p19.1"></span>..md)
