<span id="iii.iv.ii-p2"></span>[Eph.
1.1-2](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#001)<span id="iii.iv.ii-p2.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p3"></span>*“Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus
through the will of God, to the saints which are at Ephesus,* <span
id="fr_169"></span>[170](#fn_169) *and the faithful in Christ Jesus.
Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus
Christ.”*

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p5"></span><span class="c13"><span
id="iii.iv.ii-p5.1"></span>Observe</span>, he applies the word “through”
to the Father. But what then? Shall we say that He is inferior? Surely
not.

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p6"></span>“To the saints,” saith he, “which are at
Ephesus, and the faithful in Christ Jesus.”

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p7"></span>Observe that he calls saints, men with
wives, and children, and domestics. For that these are they whom he
calls by this name is plain from the end of the Epistle, as, when he
says, “Wives, be in subjection unto your own husbands.” ([Eph. v.
22](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#022)<span id="iii.iv.ii-p7.1"></span>.)
And again, “Children, obey your parents:” ([Eph. vi.
1](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#001)<span id="iii.iv.ii-p7.2"></span>.)
and, “Servants, be obedient to your masters.” ([Eph. vi.
5](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#005)<span id="iii.iv.ii-p7.3"></span>.)
Think how great is the indolence that possesses us now, how rare is any
thing like virtue now and how great the abundance of virtuous men must
have been then, when even secular men could be called “saints and
faithful.” “Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord
Jesus Christ.” “Grace” is his word; and he calls God, “Father,” since
this name is a sure token of that gift of grace. And how so? Hear what
he saith elsewhere; “Because ye are sons, God sent forth the Spirit of
His Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father.” ([Gal. iv.
6](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#006)<span id="iii.iv.ii-p7.4"></span>.)

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p8"></span>“And from the Lord Jesus Christ.”

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p9"></span>Because for us men Christ was born, and
appeared in the flesh.

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p10"></span>[Eph.
1.3](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#003)<span id="iii.iv.ii-p10.1"></span>.
“Blessed <span id="fr_170"></span>[171](#fn_170) be the God,” he saith,
“and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.”

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p12"></span>Observe; The God of Him that was
Incarnate <span id="fr_171"></span>[172](#fn_171) . And though thou wilt
not, The Father of God the Word.

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p14"></span>[Eph.
1.3](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#003)<span id="iii.iv.ii-p14.1"></span>.
“Who hath blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly
places in Christ.”

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p15"></span>He is here alluding to the blessings of
the Jews <span id="fr_172"></span>[173](#fn_172) ; for that was blessing
also, but it was not spiritual blessing. For how did it run? “The Lord
bless thee, He will bless the fruit of thy body;” ([Deut. vii.
13](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#013)<span id="iii.iv.ii-p16.1"></span>.)
and “He will bless thy going out and thy coming in.” ([Deut. xxviii.
4](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#004)<span id="iii.iv.ii-p16.2"></span>.)
But here it is not thus, but how? “With every spiritual blessing.” And
what lackest thou yet? Thou art made immortal, thou art made free, thou
art made a son, thou art made righteous, thou art made a brother, thou
art made a fellow-heir, thou reignest with Christ, thou art glorified
with Christ; all things are freely given thee. “How,” saith he, “shall
He not also with Him freely give us all things?” ([Rom. viii.
32](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#032)<span id="iii.iv.ii-p16.3"></span>.)
Thy First-fruits is adored by Angels, by the Cherubim, by the Seraphim!
What lackest thou yet? “With every spiritual blessing.” There is nothing
carnal here. Accordingly He excluded all those former blessings, when He
said, “In the world ye have tribulation,” ([John xvi.
33](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#033)<span id="iii.iv.ii-p16.4"></span>.)
to lead us on to these. For as they who possessed carnal things were
unable to hear of spiritual things, so they who aim at spiritual things
cannot attain to them unless they first stand aloof from carnal things.

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p17"></span>What again is “spiritual blessing in the
heavenly places?” It is not upon earth, he means, as was the case with
the Jews. “Ye shall eat the good of the land.” ([Isa. i.
19](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#019)<span id="iii.iv.ii-p17.1"></span>.)
“Unto a land flowing with milk and honey.” ([Ex. iii.
8](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#008)<span id="iii.iv.ii-p17.2"></span>.)
“The Lord shall bless thy land.” ([Deut. vii.
13](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#013)<span id="iii.iv.ii-p17.3"></span>.)
Here we have nothing of this sort, but what have we? “If a man love Me,
he will keep My word, and I and My Father will come unto him, and make
our abode with him.” ([John xiv.
23](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#023)<span id="iii.iv.ii-p17.4"></span>.)
“Every one therefore which heareth these words of Mine, and doeth them,
shall be likened unto a wise man which built his house upon the rock,
and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house, and
it fell not, for it was founded upon the rock.” <span id="page_51">p.
51</span> <span id="iii.iv.ii-Page_51"></span>([Matt.
7:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#024),
[25](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#025)<span
id="iii.iv.ii-p17.5"></span>.) And what is that rock but those heavenly
things which are above the reach of every change? “Every one therefore
who,” saith Christ, “shall confess Me before men, him will I also
confess before My Father which is in Heaven: But whosoever shall deny
Me, him will I also deny.” ([Matt.
10:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#032),
[33](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#033)<span
id="iii.iv.ii-p17.6"></span>.) Again, “Blessed are the pure in heart,
for they shall see God.” ([Mat. v.
8](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#008)<span id="iii.iv.ii-p17.7"></span>.)
And again, “Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of
Heaven.” ([Mat. v. 3](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#003)<span
id="iii.iv.ii-p17.8"></span>.) And again, “Blessed are ye which are
persecuted for righteousness sake, for great is your reward in Heaven.”
([Matt. 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#011),
[12](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#012)<span
id="iii.iv.ii-p17.9"></span>.) Observe, how every where He speaketh of
Heaven, no where of earth, or of the things on the earth. <span
id="fr_173"></span>[174](#fn_173) And again, “Our citizenship is in
Heaven, from whence also we wait for a Saviour the Lord Jesus Christ.”
([Philip. iii. 20](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#020)<span
id="iii.iv.ii-p18.3"></span>.) And again, “Not setting your mind on the
things that are on the earth, but on the things which are above.” ([Col.
iii. 3](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#003)<span
id="iii.iv.ii-p18.4"></span>.)

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p19"></span>“In Christ.”

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p20"></span>That is to say, this blessing was not by
the hand of Moses, but by Christ Jesus: so that we surpass them not only
in the quality of the blessings, but in the Mediator also. As moreover
he saith in the Epistle to the Hebrews; “And Moses indeed was faithful
in all his house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which
were afterward to be spoken; but Christ as a Son over His house, whose
house are we.” ([Heb. iii. 5-6](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#005)<span
id="iii.iv.ii-p20.1"></span>.)

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p21"></span>[Eph.
1.4](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#004)<span id="iii.iv.ii-p21.1"></span>.
“Even as,” he proceeds, “He chose us in Him before the foundation of the
world, that we should be holy and without blemish before Him in love.”

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p22"></span>His meaning is somewhat of this sort.
Through whom He hath blessed us, through Him He hath also chosen us. And
He, then, it is that shall bestow upon us all those rewards hereafter.
He is the very Judge that shall say, “Come, ye blessed of my Father,
inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.”
([Mat. xxv. 34](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#034)<span
id="iii.iv.ii-p22.1"></span>.) And again, “I will that where I am they
will also be with Me.” ([John xvii.
24](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#024)<span id="iii.iv.ii-p22.2"></span>.)
And this is a point which he is anxious to prove in almost all his
Epistles, that ours is no novel system, but that it had thus been
figured from the very first, that it is not the result of any change of
purpose, but had been in fact a divine dispensation and fore-ordained.
And this is a mark of great solicitude for us.

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p23"></span>What is meant by, “He chose us in Him?”
By means of the faith which is in Him, Christ, he means, happily ordered
this for us before we were born; nay more, before the foundation of the
world. And beautiful is that word “foundation,” as though he were
pointing to the world as cast down from some vast height. Yea, vast
indeed and ineffable is the height of God, so far removed not in place
but in incommunicableness of nature; so wide the distance between
creation and Creator! A word which heretics may be ashamed to
hear. <span id="fr_174"></span>[175](#fn_174)

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p25"></span>But wherefore hath He chosen us? “That
we should be holy and without a blemish before Him.” That you may not
then, when you hear that “He hath chosen us,” imagine that faith alone
is sufficient, he proceeds to add life and conduct. To this end, saith
he, hath He chosen us, and on this condition, “that we should be holy
and without blemish.” And so formerly he chose the Jews. On what terms?
“This nation, saith he, hath He chosen from the rest of the nations.”
([Deut. xiv. 2](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#002)<span
id="iii.iv.ii-p25.1"></span>.) Now if men in their choices choose what
is best, much more doth God. And indeed the fact of their being chosen
is at once a token of the loving kindness of God, and of their moral
goodness. <span id="fr_175"></span>[176](#fn_175) For by all means would
he have chosen those who were approved. He hath Himself rendered us
holy, but then we must continue holy. A holy man is he who is a partaker
of faith; a blameless man is he who leads an irreproachable life. It is
not however simply holiness and irreproachableness that He requires, but
that we should appear such “before Him.” For there are holy and
blameless characters, who yet are esteemed as such only by men, those
who are like whited sepulchres, and like such as wear sheep’s clothing.
It is not such, however, He requires, but such as the Prophet speaks of;
“And according to the cleanness of my hands.” ([Ps. xviii.
24](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#024)<span id="iii.iv.ii-p26.1"></span>.)
What cleanness? That which is so “in His eyesight.” He requires that
holiness on which the eye of God may look.

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p27"></span>Having thus spoken of the good works of
these, he again recurs to His grace. “In love,” saith he, “having
predestinated us.” Because this comes not of any pains, nor of any good
works of ours, but of love; and yet not of love alone, but of our virtue
also. For if indeed of <span id="page_52">p. 52</span> <span
id="iii.iv.ii-Page_52"></span>love alone, it would follow that all must
be saved; whereas again were it the result of our virtue alone, then
were His coming needless, and the whole dispensation. But it is the
result neither of His love alone, nor yet of our virtue, but of both.
“He chose us,” saith the Apostle; and He that chooseth, knoweth what it
is that He chooseth. “In love,” he adds, “having foreordained us;” for
virtue would never have saved any one, had there not been love. For tell
me, what would Paul have profited, how would he have exhibited what he
has exhibited, if God had not both called him from the beginning, and,
in that He loved him, drawn him to Himself? But besides, His vouchsafing
us so great privileges, was the effect of His love, not of our virtue.
Because our being rendered virtuous, and believing, and coming nigh unto
Him, even this again was the work of Him that called us Himself, and
yet, notwithstanding, it is ours also. But that on our coming nigh unto
Him, He should vouchsafe us so high privileges, as to bring us at once
from a state of enmity, to the adoption of children, this is indeed the
work of a really transcendent love.

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p28"></span>[Eph.
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#004),
[5](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#005)<span id="iii.iv.ii-p28.1"></span>.
“In love,” <span id="fr_176"></span>[177](#fn_176) saith he, “having
foreordained us unto adoption as sons through Jesus Christ unto
Himself.”

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p30"></span>Do you observe how that nothing is done
without Christ? Nothing without the Father? The one hath predestinated,
the other hath brought us near. And these words he adds by way of
heightening the things which have been done, in the same way as he says
also elsewhere, “And not only so, but we also rejoice in God, through
our Lord Jesus Christ.” ([Rom. v.
11](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#011)<span id="iii.iv.ii-p30.1"></span>.)
For great indeed are the blessings bestowed, yet are they made far
greater in being bestowed through Christ; because He sent not any
servant, though it was to servants He sent, but the Only-begotten Son
Himself.

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p31"></span>[Eph.
1.5](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#005)<span id="iii.iv.ii-p31.1"></span>.
“According to the good pleasure,” he continues, “of His will.”

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p32"></span>That is to say, because He earnestly
willed it. This is, as one might say, His earnest desire. <span
id="fr_177"></span>[178](#fn_177) For the word “good pleasure” every
where means the precedent will, for there is also another will. As for
example, the first will is that sinners should not perish; the second
will is, that, if men become wicked, they shall perish. For surely it is
not by necessity that He punishes them, but because He wills it. You may
see something of the sort even in the words of Paul, where he says, “I
would that all men were even as I myself.” ([1 Cor. vii.
7](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#007)<span id="iii.iv.ii-p33.1"></span>.)
And again, “I desire that the younger widows marry, bear children.” ([1
Tim. v. 14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#014)<span
id="iii.iv.ii-p33.2"></span>.) By “good pleasure” then he means the
first will, the earnest will, the will accompanied with earnest desire,
as in case of us, for I shall not refuse to employ even a somewhat
familiar expression, in order to speak with clearness to the simpler
sort; for thus we ourselves, to express the intentness of the will,
speak of acting according to our resolve. What he means to say then is
this, God earnestly aims at, earnestly desires, our salvation. Wherefore
then is it that He so loveth us, whence hath He such affection? It is of
His goodness alone. For grace itself is the fruit of goodness. And for
this cause, he saith, hath He predestinated us to the adoption of
children; this being His will, and the object of His earnest wish, that
the glory of His grace may be displayed. “According to the good pleasure
of His will,” he proceeds,

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p34"></span>[Eph.
1.6](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#006)<span id="iii.iv.ii-p34.1"></span>.
“To the praise of the glory of His grace, <span
id="fr_178"></span>[179](#fn_178) which He freely bestowed on us in the
Beloved.”

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p36"></span>That the glory of His grace may be
displayed, he saith, which He freely bestowed on us in the Beloved. Now
then if for this He hath shown grace to us, to the praise of the glory
of His grace, and that He may display His grace, let us abide therein.
“To the praise of His glory.” What is this? that who should praise Him?
that who should glorify Him? that we, that Angels, that Archangels, yea,
or the whole creation? And what were that? Nothing. The Divine nature
knoweth no want. And wherefore then would He have us praise and glorify
Him? It is that our love towards Him may be kindled more fervently
within us. He desireth nothing we can render; not our service, not our
praise, nor any thing else, nothing but our salvation; this is His
object in every thing He does. And he who praises and marvels at the
grace displayed towards himself will thus be more devoted and more
earnest.

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p37"></span>“Which He freely bestowed on us,” he
saith. He does not say, “Which He hath graciously given us,” (<span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.iv.ii-p37.1"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.iv.ii-p37.2"></span>χαρίσατο</span>) but,
“wherein He hath shown grace to us.” (<span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.iv.ii-p37.3"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.iv.ii-p37.4"></span>χαρίτωσεν</span>) That is to say, He hath
not only released us from our sins, but hath also made us meet
objects <span id="fr_179"></span>[180](#fn_179) of His love. It is as
though one were to take a leper, wasted by distemper, and disease, by
age, and poverty, and famine, and were to turn him all at once into a
graceful youth, surpassing all mankind in beauty, shedding a bright
lustre from his cheeks, and eclipsing the <span id="page_53">p.
53</span> <span id="iii.iv.ii-Page_53"></span>sun-beams with the glances
of his eyes; and then were to set him in the very flower of his age, and
after that array him in purple and a diadem and all the attire of
royalty. It is thus that God hath arrayed and adorned this soul of ours,
and clothed it with beauty, and rendered it an object of His delight and
love. Such a soul Angels desire to look into, yea, Archangels, and all
the holy ones. Such grace hath He shed over us, so dear hath He rendered
us to Himself. “The King,” saith the Psalmist, “shall greatly desire thy
beauty.” ([Ps. xlv. 11](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#011)<span
id="iii.iv.ii-p38.2"></span>.) Think what injurious words we uttered
heretofore, and look, what gracious words we utter now. Wealth has no
longer charms for us, nor the things that are here below, but only
heavenly things, the things that are in the heavens. When a child has
outward beauty, and has besides a pervading grace in all its sayings, do
we not call it a beautiful child? Such as this are the faithful. Look,
what words the initiated utter! What can be more beautiful than that
mouth that breathes those wondrous words, and with a pure heart and pure
lips, and beaming with cheerful confidence, partaketh of such a mystical
table? What more beautiful than the words, with which we renounce the
service of the Devil, and enlist in the service of Christ? than both
that confession which is before the Baptismal laver, <span
id="fr_180"></span>[181](#fn_180) and that which is after it? Let us
reflect as many of us as have defiled our Baptism, and weep that we may
be able again to repair it.

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p40"></span>[Eph.
1.6](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#006)<span id="iii.iv.ii-p40.1"></span>.
“In the Beloved,” <span id="fr_181"></span>[182](#fn_181) he saith, “in
whom we have <span id="fr_182"></span>[183](#fn_182) our redemption
through His Blood.” <span id="fr_183"></span>[184](#fn_183)

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p44"></span>And how is this? Not only is there this
marvel, that He hath given His Son, but yet further that He hath given
Him in such a way, as that the Beloved One Himself should be slain!

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p45"></span>Yea, and more transcendent still! He
hath given the Beloved for them that were hated. See, how high a price
he sets upon us. If, when we hated Him and were enemies, He gave the
Beloved, what will He not do now, when we are reconciled by Him through
grace?

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p46"></span>[Eph.
1.7](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#007)<span id="iii.iv.ii-p46.1"></span>.
“The forgiveness,” saith he, “of our trespasses.”

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p47"></span>Again he descends from high to low:
first speaking of adoption, and sanctification, and blamelessness, and
then of the Passion, and in this not lowering his discourse and bringing
it down from greater things to lesser, no rather, he was heightening it,
and raising it from the lesser to the greater. For nothing is so great
as that the blood of this Son should be shed for us. Greater this than
both the adoption, and all the other gifts of grace, that He spared not
even the Son. For great indeed is the forgiveness of sins, yet this is
the far greater thing, that it should be done by the Lord’s blood. For
that this is far greater than all, look how here again he exclaims,

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p48"></span>[Eph.
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#007),
[8](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#008)<span id="iii.iv.ii-p48.1"></span>.
“According to the riches of His grace, which He made to abound toward
us.”

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p49"></span>The abovementioned gifts are riches, yet
is this far more so. “Which,” saith he, “He made to abound toward us.”
They are both “riches” and “they have abounded,” that is to say, were
poured forth in ineffable measure. It is not possible to represent in
words what blessings we have in fact experienced. For riches indeed they
are, abounding riches, and He hath given in abundance riches not of man
but of God, so that on all hands it is impossible that they should be
expressed. And to show us how He gave it to such abundance, he adds,

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p50"></span>[Eph.
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#008),
[9](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#009)<span id="iii.iv.ii-p50.1"></span>.
“In all wisdom and prudence, <span id="fr_184"></span>[185](#fn_184)
having made known unto us the mystery of His will.”

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p52"></span>That is to say, Making us wise and
prudent, in that which is true wisdom, and that which is true prudence.
Strange! what friendship! For He telleth us His secrets; the mysteries,
saith he, of His will, as if one should say, He hath made known to us
the things that are in His heart. For here is indeed the mystery which
is full of all wisdom and prudence. For what will you mention equal to
this wisdom! Those that were worth nothing, it hath discovered a way of
raising them to wealth and abundance. What can equal this wise
contrivance? He that was an enemy, he that was hated, he is in a moment
lifted up on high. And not this only,—but, yet more, that it should be
done at this particular time, this again was the work of wisdom; and
that it should be done by means of the Cross. It were matter of long
discourse here to point out, how all this was the work of wisdom, and
how He had made us wise. And therefore he repeats again the words,

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p53"></span>“According to His good pleasure <span
id="fr_185"></span>[186](#fn_185) which He purposed in Him.” <span
id="fr_186"></span>[187](#fn_186)

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p56"></span>That is to say, this He desired, this He
tra<span id="page_54">p. 54</span> <span
id="iii.iv.ii-Page_54"></span>vailed for, as one might say, that He
might be able to reveal to us the mystery. What mystery? That He would
have man seated up on high. And this hath come to pass.

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p57"></span>[Eph.
1.10](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#010)<span
id="iii.iv.ii-p57.1"></span>. “Unto a dispensation of the fulness of the
times to sum up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens and the
things upon the earth, even in Him.”

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p58"></span>Heavenly things, he means to say, had
been severed from earthly. They had no longer one Head. So far indeed as
the system of the creation went, there was over all One God, but so far
as management of one household went, this, amid the wide spread of
Gentile error, was not the case, but they had been severed from His
obedience.

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p59"></span>“Unto a dispensation,” saith he, “of the
fulness of the times.”

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p60"></span>The fulness of the times, he calls it.
Observe with what nicety he speaks. And whereas he points out the
origination, the purpose, the will, the first intention, as proceeding
from the Father, and the fulfillment and execution as effected by the
agency of the Son, yet no where does he apply to him the term
minister. <span id="fr_187"></span>[188](#fn_187)

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p62"></span>“He chose us,” saith he, “in Him, having
foreordained us unto adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself;”
and, “to the praise of the glory of His grace, in whom we have
redemption through His blood,—which He purposed in Him, unto a
dispensation of the fulness of the times, to sum up all things in
Christ;” and no where hath he called Him minister. If however the word
“in” and the word “by” implies a mere minister, look what the matter
comes to. Just in the very beginning of the Epistle, he used the
expression “through the will of the Father.” The Father, he means,
willed, the Son wrought. But neither does it follow, that because the
Father willed, the Son is excluded from the willing; nor because the Son
wrought, that the Father is deprived of the working. But to the Father
and the Son, all things are common. “For all Mine are Thine,” saith He,
“and Thine are Mine.” ([John xvii.
10](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#010)<span id="iii.iv.ii-p62.1"></span>.)

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p63"></span>The fullness of the times, <span
id="fr_188"></span>[189](#fn_188) however, was His coming. After, then,
He had done everything, by the ministry both of Angels, and of Prophets,
and of the Law, and nothing came of it, and it was well nigh come to
this, that man had been made in vain, brought into the world in vain,
nay, rather to his ruin; when all were absolutely perishing, more
fearfully than in the deluge, He devised this dispensation, that is by
grace; that it might not be in vain, might not be to no purpose that man
was created. This he calls “the fulness of the times,” and “wisdom.” And
why so? Because at that time when they were on the very point of
perishing, then they were rescued.

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p65"></span>That “He might sum up” he saith.

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p66"></span>What is the meaning of this word, “sum
up?” It is “to knit together.” Let us, however, endeavor to get near the
exact import. With ourselves then, in common conversation, the word
means the summing into a brief compass things spoken at length, the
concise account of matters described in detail. And it has this meaning.
For Christ hath gathered up in Himself the dispensations carried on
through a lengthened period, that is to say, He hath cut them short. For
“by finishing His word and cutting it short in righteousness,” ([Rom.
ix. 28](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#028)<span
id="iii.iv.ii-p66.1"></span>.) He both comprehended former
dispensations, and added others beside. This is the meaning of “summing
up.”

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p67"></span>It has also another signification; and
of what nature is this? He hath set over all one and the same Head,
i.e., Christ according to the flesh, alike over Angels and men. That is
to say, He hath given to Angels and men one and the same government; to
the one the Incarnate, to the other God the Word. <span
id="fr_189"></span>[190](#fn_189) Just as one might say of a house which
has some part decayed and the other sound, He hath rebuilt the house,
that is to say, He has made it stronger, and laid a firmer foundation.
So also here He hath brought all under one and the same Head. <span
id="fr_190"></span>[191](#fn_190) For thus will an union be <span
id="page_55">p. 55</span> <span id="iii.iv.ii-Page_55"></span>effected,
thus will a close bond be effected, if one and all can be brought under
one and the same Head, and thus have some constraining bond of union
from above. Honored then as we are with so great a blessing, so high a
privilege, so great loving-kindness, let us not shame our Benefactor,
let us not render in vain so great grace. Let us exemplify the life of
Angels, the virtue of Angels, the conversation of Angels, yea, I entreat
and conjure you, that all these things turn not to our judgment, nor to
our condemnation, but to our enjoyment of those good things, which may
God grant we may all attain, in Christ Jesus, our Lord, with whom to the
Father, together with the Holy Ghost, be glory, strength, &c. &c.

superfluous after the definite words preceding. In four other passages

proposition which will strike a Protestant reader of any denomination
with surprise, to say the least. Schaff says, “Chrysostom laid great
stress on free will and the co-operation of the human will with divine
grace in the work of conversion. Cassian, the founder of
Semi-Pelagianism, was his pupil and appealed to his authority. We may
say that in tendency and spirit he was a Catholic Semi-Pelagian or
Synergist before Semi-Pelagianism was brought into a system.”
*Prolegomena* p. 20. Chrysostom’s exposition of this passage is
inaccurate, inconsistent, illogical and untenable. If He chose us in
order that we should be holy how can holiness, or “moral goodness,” as
Chrysostom says, be an antecedent condition of His choosing us? See note
on ch. ii. 10.—G.A.\]

Messenger. The distinction is obvious; our Lord may be named the
Minister or Instrument of the Father in the sense in which our reason
may be called the instrument of our mind, as being one with it and in
it. In this sense St. Hilary calls the Son *obedientem dictis Dei Deum.

employed by Harless whose view of this passage is that the apostle
speaks thus: ‘The Lord and Creator of the whole body of which heaven and
earth are members, has in the restoration of one member restored the
whole body; and in this consists the greatest significance of the
reconciliation that it is not merely a restoration of the life of earth
but a bringing back of the harmony of the universe. This concedes to the
τὰ ἐπὶ τοῖς οὐρανοῖς merely an *indirect* participation in the
ανακεφαλαίωσις and the *de facto* operation of the Messianic οἰκονομία
on the heavenly world is set aside,—which appears the less admissible
inasmuch as the τὰ ἐπὶ τοῖς οὐρανοῖς has the precedence (in
position).”—Meyer. “Heaven and earth have become places of sin ([Eph.
6.12](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#012)<span
id="iii.iv.ii-p69.1"></span>;) indeed heaven was the first theatre of
sin when a part of the angels fell into sin and away from God ([1 Tim.
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#006), [1 John
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#008), [Jas.
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#019), [2 Pet.
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#004)<span
id="iii.iv.ii-p69.2"></span>;) thence it came to earth ([2 Cor.
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#003), [1 Cor.
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#020),
[21](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#021)<span
id="iii.iv.ii-p69.3"></span>.) Thus the state originally appointed by
God and the development He wished to be without disturbance, ceased
([Rom. viii. 18-24](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#018)<span
id="iii.iv.ii-p69.4"></span>,) so that a renewing of the heavens and the
earth was taken into view ([2 Peter iii.
13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#013)<span id="iii.iv.ii-p69.5"></span>.)
The center of this renewal is Christ and His redeeming work. Here we may
certainly apply what Bengel so aptly remarks on [Rom. viii.
19](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#019)<span id="iii.iv.ii-p69.6"></span>.
that *pro suo quodque genus captu*, ‘every kind according to its
capacity,’ participates in this Anacephalaiosis, the evil (angels) as
conquered and rejected opponents, the good angels as participating
friends, the redeemed as accepted children, the rest of creation as
subordinate companions.”—Braune *in Lange*. Similarly Eadie: “Not only
has harmony been restored to the universe and the rupture occasioned by
sin repaired, but beings still in rebellion are placed under Christ’s
control, as well as the unconscious elements and spheres of nature. This
summation is seen in the form of government: Jesus is universal
regent.”—G.A.\]
