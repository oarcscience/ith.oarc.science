class="c1"><span id="v.iii.vi-p2.2"></span>[1 Tim.
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#018.md),

id="v.iii.vi-p2.3"></span></span>

<span id="v.iii.vi-p3"></span>*“This charge I commit unto thee, son \[my
child,* <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.iii.vi-p3.1"></span>τέκνον</span>*\] Timothy, according to the
prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them mightest
\[mayest\] war a good warfare; holding faith, and a good conscience;
which some having put away have made shipwreck concerning the faith.”*

<span id="v.iii.vi-p4"></span><span class="c13"><span
id="v.iii.vi-p4.1"></span>The</span> office of a Teacher and that of a
Priest is of great dignity, and to bring forward one that is worthy
requires a divine election. So it was of old, and so it is now, when we
make a choice without human passion, not looking to any temporal
consideration, swayed neither by friendship, nor enmity. For though we
be not partakers of so great a measure of the Spirit as they, yet a good
purpose is sufficient to draw unto us the election of God. For the
Apostles, when they elected Matthias, had not yet received the Holy
Spirit, but having committed the matter to prayer, they chose him into
the number of the Apostles. For they looked not to human friendships.
And so now too it ought to be with us. But we have advanced to the
extreme of negligence; and even what is clearly evident, we let pass.
Now when we overlook what is manifest, how will God reveal to us what is
unseen? as it is said, “If ye have not been faithful in that which is
little, who will commit to you that which is great and true?” ([Luke
xvi. 11](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#011.md)<span
id="v.iii.vi-p4.2"></span>.) But then, when nothing human was done, the
appointment of Priests too was by prophecy. What is “by prophecy”? By
the Holy Spirit. For prophecy is not only the telling of things future,
but also of the present. It was by prophecy that Saul was discovered
“hidden among the stuff.” ([1 Sam. x.
22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#022)<span id="v.iii.vi-p4.3"></span>..md)
For God reveals things to the righteous. So it was said by prophecy,
“Separate me Barnabas and Saul.” ([Acts xiii.
2](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#002)<span id="v.iii.vi-p4.4"></span>..md) In
this way Timothy also was chosen, concerning whom he speaks of
prophecies in the plural; that, perhaps, upon which <span
id="fr_1146"></span>[1147](#fn_1146.md) he “took and circumcised him,” and
when he ordained him, as he himself says in his Epistle to him, “Neglect
not the gift that is in thee.” ([1 Tim. iv.
14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#014)<span id="v.iii.vi-p5.1"></span>..md)
Therefore to elevate him, and prepare him to be sober and watchful, he
reminds him by whom he was chosen and ordained, as if he had said, “God
hath chosen thee. He gave thee thy commission, thou wast not made by
human vote. Do not therefore abuse or bring into disgrace the
appointment of God.” When again he speaks of a charge, which implies
something burdensome, <span id="fr_1147"></span>[1148](#fn_1147.md) he
adds, “This charge I commit to thee, son Timothy.” He charges him as
<span id="page_424">p. 424</span> <span
id="v.iii.vi-Page_424"></span>his son, his own son, not so much with
arbitrary or despotic authority as like a father, he says, “my son
Timothy.” The “committing,” however, implies that it is to be diligently
kept, and that it is not our own. For we did not obtain it for
ourselves, but God conferred it upon us; and not it only, but also
“faith and a good conscience.” What He hath given us then, let us keep.
For if He had not come, the faith had not been to be found, nor that
pure life which we learn by education. As if he had said, “It is not I
that charge thee, but He who chose thee,” and this is meant by “the
prophecies that went before on thee.” Listen to them, obey them.

<span id="v.iii.vi-p7"></span>And say; what chargest thou? “That by them
thou shouldest war a good warfare.” They chose thee, that then for which
they chose thee do thou, “war a good warfare.” He named “a good
warfare,” since there is a bad warfare, of which he says, “As ye have
yielded your members instruments <span
id="fr_1148"></span>[1149](#fn_1148.md) to uncleanness and to iniquity.”
([Rom. vi. 19](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#019.md)<span
id="v.iii.vi-p8.2"></span>.) Those men serve under a tyrant, but thou
servest under a King. And why calls he it a warfare? To show how mighty
a contest is to be maintained by all, but especially by a Teacher; that
we require strong arms, and sobriety, and awakenedness, and continual
vigilance: that we must prepare ourselves for blood and conflicts, must
be in battle array, and have nothing relaxed. “That thou shouldest war
in them,” he says. For as in an army all do not serve in the same
capacity, but in their different stations; so also in the Church one has
the office of a Teacher, another that of a disciple, another that of a
private man. But thou art in this. And, because this is not sufficient
he adds,

<span id="v.iii.vi-p9"></span>[1 Tim.
1.19](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#019.md)<span id="v.iii.vi-p9.1"></span>.
“Holding faith, and a good conscience.”

<span id="v.iii.vi-p10"></span>For he that would be a Teacher must first
teach himself. For as he who has not first been a good soldier, will
never be a general, so it is with the Teacher; wherefore he says
elsewhere, “Lest when I have preached to others, I myself should be a
cast-away.” ([1 Cor. ix. 27](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#027.md)<span
id="v.iii.vi-p10.1"></span>.) “Holding faith,” he says, “and a good
conscience,” that so thou mayest preside over others. When we hear this,
let us not disdain the exhortations of our superiors, though we be
Teachers. For if Timothy, to whom all of us together are not worthy to
be compared, receives commands and is instructed, and that being himself
in the Teacher’s office, much more should we. “Which some having put
away, have made shipwreck concerning the faith.” <span
id="fr_1149"></span>[1150](#fn_1149.md) And this follows naturally. For
when the life is corrupt, it engenders a doctrine congenial to it, and
from this circumstance many are seen to fall into a gulf of evil, and to
turn aside into Heathenism. For that they may not be tormented with the
fear of futurity, they endeavor to persuade their souls, that what we
preach is false. And some turn aside from the faith, who seek out
everything by reasoning; for reasoning produces shipwreck, while faith
is as a safe ship.

<span id="v.iii.vi-p12"></span>They then who turn aside from the faith
must suffer shipwreck; and this he shows by an example.

<span id="v.iii.vi-p13"></span>[1 Tim.
1.20](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#020.md)<span id="v.iii.vi-p13.1"></span>.
“Of whom are Hymenæus and Alexander.”

<span id="v.iii.vi-p14"></span>And from them he would instruct us. You
see how even from those times there have been seducing Teachers, curious
enquirers, and men holding off from the faith, and searching out <span
id="fr_1150"></span>[1151](#fn_1150.md) by their own reasonings. As the
shipwrecked man is naked and destitute of all things, so is he that
falls away from the faith without resource, he knows not where to stand
or where to stay himself, nor has he the advantage of a good life so as
to gain anything from that quarter. For when the head is disordered,
what avails the rest of the body? and if faith without a good life is
unavailing, much more is the converse true. If God despises His own for
our sakes, much more ought we to despise our own for His sake. <span
id="fr_1151"></span>[1152](#fn_1151.md) For so it is, where any one falls
away from the faith, he has no steadiness, he swims this way and that,
till at last he is lost in the deep.

<span id="v.iii.vi-p17"></span>“Whom I delivered to Satan, that they
might be taught not to blaspheme!” Thus it is blasphemy to search into
divine things by our own reasonings. For what have human reasonings in
common with them? But how does Satan instruct them not to blaspheme? can
he instruct others, who has not yet taught himself, but is a blasphemer
still? It is not that “he should instruct,” but *that they should be
instructed*. It is not he that does it, though such is the result. As
elsewhere he says in the case of the fornicator: “To deliver such an one
to Satan for the destruction of the flesh.” Not that he may save the
body, but “that the spirit may be saved.” ([1 Cor. v.
5](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#005)<span id="v.iii.vi-p17.1"></span>..md)
Therefore it is spoken impersonally. How then is this effected? As
executioners, though themselves laden with numberless crimes, are made
the correctors of others; so it is here with the evil spirit. But why
didst thou not punish them thyself, as thou didst that Bar-Jesus, and as
Peter did Ananias, instead of delivering them to Satan? It was not that
they might be punished, but that they might <span id="page_425">p.
425</span> <span id="v.iii.vi-Page_425"></span>be instructed. For that
he had the power appears from other passages, “What will ye? Shall I
come unto you with a rod?” ([1 Cor. iv.
21](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#021)<span id="v.iii.vi-p17.2"></span>..md)
And again, “Lest I should use sharpness, according to the power which
the Lord hath given me to edification, and not to destruction.” ([2 Cor.
xiii. 10](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#010.md)<span
id="v.iii.vi-p17.3"></span>.) Why did he then call upon Satan to punish
them? That the disgrace might be greater, as the severity and the
punishment was more striking. Or rather, they themselves chastised those
who did not yet believe, but those who turned aside, they delivered to
Satan. Why then did Peter punish Ananias? Because whilst he was tempting
the Holy Ghost, he was still an unbeliever. That the unbelieving
therefore might learn that they could not escape, they themselves
inflicted punishment upon them; but those who had learnt this, yet
afterwards turned aside, they delivered to Satan; showing that they were
sustained not by their own power, but by their care for them; and as
many as were lifted up into arrogance were delivered to him. For as
kings with their own hands slay their enemies, but deliver their
subjects to executioners for punishment, so it is in this case. And
these acts were done to show the authority committed to the Apostles.
Nor was it a slight power, to be able thus to subject the devil to their
commands. For this shows that he served and obeyed them even against his
will, and this was no little proof of the power of grace. And listen how
he delivered them: “When ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with
the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, to deliver such an one unto Satan.”
([1 Cor. v. 4](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#004.md)<span
id="v.iii.vi-p17.4"></span>.) He was then immediately expelled from the
common assembly, he was separated from the fold, he became deserted and
destitute; he was delivered to the wolf. For as the cloud designated the
camp of the Hebrews, so the Spirit distinguished the Church. If any one
therefore was without, he was consumed, <span
id="fr_1152"></span>[1153](#fn_1152.md) and it was by the judgment of the
Apostles that he was cast out of the pale. So also the Lord delivered
Judas to Satan. For immediately “after the sop Satan entered into him.”
([John xiii. 27](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#027.md)<span
id="v.iii.vi-p18.3"></span>.) Or this may be said; that those whom they
wished to amend, they did not themselves punish, but reserved their
punishments for those who were incorrigible. Or otherwise, that they
were the more dreaded for delivering them up to others. Job also was
delivered to Satan, but not for his sins, but for fuller proof of his
worth.

<span id="v.iii.vi-p19"></span>Many such instances still occur. For
since the Priests cannot know who are sinners, and unworthy partakers of
the holy Mysteries, God often in this way delivers them to Satan. For
when diseases, and attacks, <span id="fr_1153"></span>[1154](#fn_1153.md)
and sorrows, and calamities, and the like occur, it is on this account
that they are inflicted. This is shown by Paul. “For this cause many are
weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.” ([1 Cor. xi.
30](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#030)<span id="v.iii.vi-p20.1"></span>..md)
But how? saith one, when we approach but once a year! But this is indeed
the evil, that you determine the worthiness of your approach, not by the
purity of your minds, but by the interval of time. You think it a proper
caution not to communicate often; not considering that you are seared by
partaking unworthily, though only once, but to receive worthily, though
often, is salutary. It is not presumptuous to receive often, but to
receive unworthily, though but once in a whole life. But we are so
miserably foolish, that, though we commit numberless offenses in the
course of a year, we are not anxious to be absolved from them, but are
satisfied, that we do not often make bold impudently to insult the Body
of Christ, not remembering that those who crucified Christ, crucified
Him but once. Is the offense then the less, because committed but once?
Judas betrayed his Master but once. What then, did that exempt him from
punishment? Why indeed is time to be considered in this matter? let our
time of coming be when our conscience is pure. The Mystery at Easter is
not of more efficacy than that which is now celebrated. It is one and
the same. There is the same grace of the Spirit, it is always a
Passover. <span id="fr_1154"></span>[1155](#fn_1154.md) You who are
initiated know this. On the Preparation, <span
id="fr_1155"></span>[1156](#fn_1155.md) on the Sabbath, on the Lord’s day,
and on the day of Martyrs, it is the same Sacrifice that is performed.
“For as often,” he saith, “as ye eat this bread and drink this cup, ye
do show the Lord’s death.” ([1 Cor. xi.
26](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#026)<span id="v.iii.vi-p22.1"></span>..md)
No time is limited for the performance of this Sacrifice, why then is it
then called the Paschal feast? <span
id="fr_1156"></span>[1157](#fn_1156.md) Because Christ suffered for us
then. Let not the time, therefore, make any difference in your approach.
There is at all times the same power, the same dignity, the same grace,
one and the same body; nor is one celebration of it more or less holy
than another. And this you know, who see upon these occasions nothing
new, save these worldly veils, and a more splendid attendance. The only
thing that these days have more is that from them commenced the day of
our salvation when Christ was sacrificed. But with respect to these
mysteries, those days have no further preëminence.

<span id="v.iii.vi-p24"></span><span id="page_426">p. 426</span> <span
id="v.iii.vi-Page_426"></span>When you approach to take bodily food, you
wash your hands and your mouth, but when you draw nigh to this spiritual
food, you do not cleanse your soul, but approach full of uncleanness.
But you say, Are not the forty days’ fastings sufficient to cleanse the
huge heap of our sins? But of what use is it, tell me? If wishing to
store up some precious unguent, you should make clean a place to receive
it, and a little after having laid it up, should throw dung upon it,
would not the fine odor vanish? This takes place with us too. We make
ourselves to the best of our power worthy to approach; then we defile
ourselves again! What then is the good of it? This we say even of those
who are able in those forty days to wash themselves clean.

<span id="v.iii.vi-p25"></span>Let us then, I beseech you, not neglect
our salvation, that our labor may not be in vain. For he who turns from
his sins, and goes and commits the same again, is “like a dog that
returneth to his vomit.” ([Prov. xxvi.
11](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#011)<span id="v.iii.vi-p25.1"></span>..md)
But if we act as we ought, and take heed to our ways, we shall be
thought worthy of those high rewards, which that we may all obtain, God
grant through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ,
with whom, &c.
