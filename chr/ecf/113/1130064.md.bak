<span id="iv.iv.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c10"><span
id="iv.iv.vi-p1.1"></span>Homily VI.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.vi-p2"></span><span id="iv.iv.vi-p2.1"></span><span
class="c1"><span id="iv.iv.vi-p2.2"></span>[Col.
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#006.md),
[7](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#007.md)<span
id="iv.iv.vi-p2.3"></span></span>

<span id="iv.iv.vi-p3"></span>“As therefore ye received Christ Jesus the
Lord, so walk in Him, rooted and built up in Him, and stablished in your
faith, even as ye were taught, abounding in thanksgiving.”

<span id="iv.iv.vi-p4"></span><span class="c13"><span
id="iv.iv.vi-p4.1"></span>Again</span>, he takes hold on them beforehand
with their own testimony, saying, “As therefore ye received.” We
introduce no strange addition, he saith, neither do ye. “Walk ye in
Him,” for He is the Way that leadeth to the Father: not in the Angels;
this way leadeth not thither. “Rooted,” that is, fixed; not one while
going this way, another that, but “rooted”: now that which is rooted,
never can remove. Observe how appropriate are the expressions he
employs. “And built up,” that is, in thought attaining unto Him. “And
stablished” in Him, that is, holding Him, built as on a foundation. He
shows that they had fallen down, for the word “built” <span
id="fr_788"></span>[789](#fn_788.md) has this force. For the faith is in
truth a building; and needs both a strong foundation, and secure
construction. For both if any one build not upon a secure foundation it
will shake; and even though he do, if it be not firm, it will not stand.
“As ye were taught.” Again, the word “As.” “Abounding,” he saith, “in
thanksgiving”; for this is the part of well-disposed persons, I say not
simply to give thanks, but with great abundance, more than ye learned,
if possible, with much ambition.

<span id="iv.iv.vi-p6"></span>[Col.
2.8](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#008.md)<span id="iv.iv.vi-p6.1"></span>.
“Take heed lest there shall be any one that maketh spoil of you.”

<span id="iv.iv.vi-p7"></span>Seest thou how he shows him to be a thief,
and an alien, and one that enters in softly? For he has already
represented him to be entering in. “Beware.” And he well said “maketh
spoil.” As one digging away a mound from underneath, may give no
perceptible sign, yet it gradually settles, so do you also beware; for
this is his main point, not even to let himself be perceived. As if some
one were robbing every day, and he (the owner of the house) were told,
“Beware lest there be some one”; and he shows the way—through this
way—as if we were to say, through this chamber; <span
id="fr_789"></span>[790](#fn_789.md) so, “through philosophy,” says he.

<span id="iv.iv.vi-p9"></span>Then because the term “philosophy” has an
appearance of dignity, he added, “and vain deceit.” For there is also a
good deceit; such as many have been deceived by, which one ought not
even to call a deceit at all. Whereof Jeremiah speaks; “O Lord, Thou
hast deceived me, and I was deceived” <span
id="fr_790"></span>[791](#fn_790.md) ([Jer. xx.
7](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#007)<span id="iv.iv.vi-p10.1"></span>..md);
for such as this one ought not to call a deceit at all; for Jacob also
deceived his father, but that was not a deceit, but an economy. “Through
his philosophy,” he saith, “and vain deceit, after the tradition of men,
after the rudiments <span id="fr_791"></span>[792](#fn_791.md) of the
world, and not after Christ.” Now he sets about to reprove their
observance of particular days, <span id="fr_792"></span>[793](#fn_792.md)
meaning by elements of the world the sun and moon; <span
id="fr_793"></span>[794](#fn_793.md) as he also said in the Epistle to the
Galatians, “How turn ye back again to the weak and beggarly elements?”
([Gal. iv. 9](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#009.md)<span
id="iv.iv.vi-p13.2"></span>.) And he said not observances of days, but
in general of the present world, to show its worthlessness: for if the
present world be nothing, much more then its elements. Having first
shown how great benefits and kindnesses they had received, he afterwards
brings on his accusation, thereby to show its greater seriousness, and
to convict his hearers. Thus too the Prophets do. They always first
point out the benefits, and then they magnify their accusation; as
Esaias saith, “I have begotten children, and exalted them, but they have
rejected me” ([Isa. i. 2](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#002.md)<span
id="iv.iv.vi-p13.3"></span>, Sept.); and <span id="page_285">p.
285</span> <span id="iv.iv.vi-Page_285"></span>again, “O my people, what
have I done unto thee, or wherein have I grieved thee, or wherein have I
wearied thee”? ([Mic. vi. 3](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#003.md)<span
id="iv.iv.vi-p13.4"></span>.) and David; as when he says, “I heard thee
in the secret place of the tempest” ([Ps. lxxxi.
7](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#007.md)<span id="iv.iv.vi-p13.5"></span>,
Sept.); and again, “Open thy mouth, and I will fill it.” ([Ps. lxxxi.
10](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#010)<span id="iv.iv.vi-p13.6"></span>..md)
And everywhere you will find it the same.

<span id="iv.iv.vi-p14"></span>That indeed were most one’s duty, not to
be persuaded by them, even did they say aught to the purpose; as it is,
however, obligations apart even, it would be our duty to shun those
things. “And not after Christ,” he saith. For were it in such sort a
matter done by halves, that ye were able to serve both the one and the
other, not even so ought ye to do it; as it is, however, he suffers you
not to be “after Christ.” Those things withdraw you from Him. Having
first shaken to pieces the Grecian observances, he next overthrows the
Jewish ones also. For both Greeks and Jews practiced many observances,
but the former from philosophy, the latter from the Law. First then, he
makes at those against whom lay the heavier accusation. How, “not after
Christ”?

<span id="iv.iv.vi-p15"></span>[Col.
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#009.md),
[10](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#010.md)<span id="iv.iv.vi-p15.1"></span>.
“For in Him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily: and in Him
ye are made full, who is the head of all principality and power.”

<span id="iv.iv.vi-p16"></span>Observe how in his accusing of the one he
thrusts through the other, by first giving the solution, and then the
objection. For such a solution is not suspected, and the hearer accepts
it the rather, that the speaker is not making it his aim. For in that
case indeed he would make a point of not coming off worsted, but in
this, not so. “For in Him dwelleth,” that is, for God dwelleth in Him.
But that thou mayest not think Him enclosed, as in a body, he saith,
“All the fullness of the Godhead bodily: and ye are made full in Him.”
Others say that he intends the Church filled by His Godhead, as he
elsewhere saith, “of Him that filleth all in all” ([Eph. i.
23](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#023)<span id="iv.iv.vi-p16.1"></span>..md),
and that the term “bodily” is here, as the body in the head. How is it
then that he did not add, “which is the Church”? Some again say it is
with reference to The Father, that he says that the fullness of the
Godhead dwells in Him, but wrongly. <span
id="fr_794"></span>[795](#fn_794.md) First, because “to dwell,” cannot
strictly be said of God: next, because the “fullness” is not that which
receives, for “the earth is the Lord’s, and the fullness thereof” ([Ps.
xxiv. 1](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#001.md)<span
id="iv.iv.vi-p17.2"></span>.); and again the Apostle, “until the
fullness of the Gentiles be come in.” ([Rom. xi.
25](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#025)<span id="iv.iv.vi-p17.3"></span>..md)
By “fullness” is meant “the whole.” Then the word “bodily,” what did it
intend? “As in a head.” But why does he say the same thing over again?
“And ye are made full in Him.” What then does it mean? That ye have
nothing less than He. As it dwelt in Him, so also in you. For Paul is
ever straining to bring us near to Christ; as when he says, “Hath raised
us up with Him, and made us to sit with Him” ([Eph. ii.
6](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#006)<span id="iv.iv.vi-p17.4"></span>..md):
and, “If we endure, we shall also reign with Him” ([2 Tim. ii.
12](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#012)<span id="iv.iv.vi-p17.5"></span>..md):
and, “How shall He not also with Him freely give us all things” ([Rom.
viii. 32](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#032.md)<span
id="iv.iv.vi-p17.6"></span>.): and calling us “fellow-heirs.” Then as
for His dignity. And He “is the head of all principality and power.”
([Eph. iii. 6](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#006.md)<span
id="iv.iv.vi-p17.7"></span>.) He that is above all, The Cause, is He not
Consubstantial? Then he has added the benefit in a marvelous way; and
far more marvelous than in the Epistle to the Romans. For there indeed
he saith, “circumcision of the heart in the spirit, not in the letter”
([Rom. ii. 29](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#029.md)<span
id="iv.iv.vi-p17.8"></span>.), but here, in Christ.

<span id="iv.iv.vi-p18"></span>[Col.
2.11](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#011.md)<span id="iv.iv.vi-p18.1"></span>.
“In whom ye were also circumcised with a circumcision not made with
hands, in the putting off of the body of the flesh in the circumcision
of Christ.”

<span id="iv.iv.vi-p19"></span>See how near he is come to the thing. He
saith, “In the putting” quite away, <span
id="fr_795"></span>[796](#fn_795.md) not putting off merely. “The body of
sins.” He means, “the old life.” He is continually adverting to this in
different ways, as he said above, “Who delivered us out of the power of
darkness, and reconciled us who were alienated,” that we should be “holy
and without blemish.” ([Col. 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#013.md),
[21](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#021)<span id="iv.iv.vi-p20.1"></span>..md)
No longer, he saith, is the circumcision with <span
id="fr_796"></span>[797](#fn_796.md) the knife, but in Christ Himself; for
no hand imparts this circumcision, as is the case there, but the Spirit.
It circumciseth not a part, but the whole man. It is the body both in
the one and the other case, but in the one it is carnally, in the other
it is spiritually circumcised; but not as the Jews, for ye have not put
off flesh, but sins. When and where? In Baptism. And what he calls
circumcision, he again calls burial. Observe how he again passes on to
the subject of righteous doings; “of the sins,” he saith, “of the
flesh,” the things they had done in the flesh. He speaks of a greater
thing than circumcision, for they did not merely cast away that of which
they were circumcised, but they destroyed it, they annihilated it.

<span id="iv.iv.vi-p22"></span>[Col.
2.12](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#012.md)<span id="iv.iv.vi-p22.1"></span>.
“Buried with him,” he saith, “in Baptism, wherein ye were also raised
with Him, through faith in the working of God, who raised Him from the
dead.”

<span id="iv.iv.vi-p23"></span>But it is not burial only: for behold
what he says, “Wherein ye were also raised with Him, through faith in
the working of God, who raised Him from the dead.” He hath well said,
“of faith,” <span id="fr_797"></span>[798](#fn_797.md) for it is all of
faith. Ye believed that <span id="page_286">p. 286</span> <span
id="iv.iv.vi-Page_286"></span>God is able to raise, and so ye were
raised. Then note also His worthiness of belief, “Who raised Him,” he
saith, “from the dead.”

<span id="iv.iv.vi-p25"></span>He now shows the Resurrection. “And you
who sometime were dead through your trespasses and the uncircumcision of
your flesh, you, I say, did He quicken together with Him.” For ye lay
under judgment of death. But even though ye died, it was a profitable
death. Observe how again he shows what they deserved in the words he
subjoins:

<span id="iv.iv.vi-p26"></span>[Col.
2.13-15](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#013.md)<span
id="iv.iv.vi-p26.1"></span>. “Having forgiven us all our trespasses;
having blotted out the bond written in ordinances that was against us,
which was contrary to us: and he hath taken it out of the way, nailing
it to the Cross; having put off from himself the principalities and the
powers, He made a show of them openly, <span
id="fr_798"></span>[799](#fn_798.md) triumphing over them in it.”

<span id="iv.iv.vi-p28"></span>“Having forgiven us,” he saith, “all our
trespasses,” those which produced that deadness. What then? Did He allow
them to remain? No, He even wiped them out; He did not scratch them out
merely; so that they could not be seen. “In doctrines” <span
id="fr_799"></span>[800](#fn_799.md) \[ordinances\], he saith. What
doctrines? The Faith. It is enough to believe. He hath not set works
against works, but works against faith. And what next? Blotting out is
an advance upon remission; again he saith, “And hath taken it out of the
way.” Nor yet even so did He preserve it, but rent it even in sunder,
“by nailing it to His Cross.” “Having put off from himself the
principalities and the powers, He made a show of them openly, triumphing
over them in it.” Nowhere has he spoken in so lofty a strain.

<span id="iv.iv.vi-p30"></span>Seest thou how great His earnestness that
the bond should be done away? To wit, we all were under sin and
punishment. He Himself, through suffering punishment, did away with both
the sin and the punishment, and He was punished on the Cross. To the
Cross then He affixed it; as having power, He tore it asunder. What
bond? He means either that which they said to Moses, namely, “All that
God hath said will we do, and be obedient” ([Ex. xxiv.
3](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#003)<span id="iv.iv.vi-p30.1"></span>..md),
or, if not that, this, that we owe to God obedience; or if not this, he
means that the devil held possession of it, the bond which God made for
Adam, saying, “In the day thou eatest of the tree, thou shalt die.”
([Gen. ii. 17](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#017.md)<span
id="iv.iv.vi-p30.2"></span>.) This bond then the devil held in his
possession. And Christ did not give it to us, but Himself tore it in
two, the action of one who remits joyfully.

<span id="iv.iv.vi-p31"></span>“Having put off from himself the
principalities and the powers.” He means the diabolical powers; because
human nature had arrayed itself in these, or because they had, <span
id="fr_800"></span>[801](#fn_800.md) as it were, a hold, when He became Man
He put away from Himself that hold. What is the meaning of “He made a
show of them”? And well said he so; never yet was the devil in so
shameful a plight. For whilst expecting to have Him, he lost even those
he had; and when That Body was nailed to the Cross, the dead arose.
There death received his wound, having met his death-stroke from a dead
body. And as an athlete, when he thinks he has hit his adversary,
himself is caught in a fatal grasp; so truly doth Christ also show, that
to die with confidence <span id="fr_801"></span>[802](#fn_801.md) is the
devil’s shame.

<span id="iv.iv.vi-p34"></span>For he would have done everything to
persuade men that He did not die, had he had the power. For seeing that
of His Resurrection indeed all succeeding time was proof demonstrative;
whilst of His death, no other time save that whereat it happened could
ever furnish proof; therefore it was, that He died publicly in the sight
of all men, but He arose not publicly, knowing that the aftertime would
bear witness to the truth. For, that whilst the world was looking on,
the serpent should be slain on high upon the Cross, herein is the
marvel. For what did not the devil do, that He might die in secret? Hear
Pilate saying, “Take ye Him away, and crucify Him, for I find no fault
in Him” ([John xix. 6](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#006.md)<span
id="iv.iv.vi-p34.1"></span>.), and withstanding them in a thousand ways.
And again the Jews said unto Him, “If Thou art the Son of God, come down
from the Cross.” ([Matt. xxvii.
40](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#040)<span id="iv.iv.vi-p34.2"></span>..md)
Then further, when He had received a mortal wound, and He came not down,
for this reason He was also committed to burial; for it was in His power
to have risen immediately: but He did not, that the fact might be
believed. And yet in cases of private death indeed, it is possible to
impute them to a swoon, but here, it is not possible to do this either.
For even the soldiers brake not His legs, like those of the others, that
it might be made manifest that He was dead. And those who buried The
Body are known; and therefore too the Jews themselves seal the stone
along with the soldiers. For, what was most of all attended to, was this
very thing, that it should not be in obscurity. And the witnesses to it
are from enemies, from the Jews. Hear them saying to Pilate, “That
deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I rise again.
Command therefore that the sep<span id="page_287">p. 287</span> <span
id="iv.iv.vi-Page_287"></span>ulchre” ([Matt.
26:63](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#063.md),
[64](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#064)<span id="iv.iv.vi-p34.3"></span>..md)
be guarded by the soldiers. This was accordingly done, themselves also
sealing it. Hear them further saying even afterwards to the Apostles,
“Ye intend to bring this Man’s blood upon us.” ([Acts v.
28](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#028)<span id="iv.iv.vi-p34.4"></span>..md)
He suffered not the very fashion of His Cross to be put to shame. For
since the Angels have suffered nothing like it, He therefore doth
everything for this, showing that His death achieved a mighty work.
There was, as it were, a single combat. Death wounded Christ: but
Christ, being wounded, did afterwards kill death. He that seemed to be
immortal, was destroyed by a mortal body; and this the whole world saw.
And what is truly wonderful is, that He committed not this thing to
another. But there was made again a second bond of another kind than the
former.

<span id="iv.iv.vi-p35"></span>Beware then lest we be condemned by this,
after saying, I renounce Satan, and array myself with Thee, O Christ.
Rather however this should not be called “a bond,” but a covenant. For
that is “a bond,” whereby one is held accountable for debts: but this is
a covenant. It hath no penalty, nor saith it, If this be done or if this
be not done: what Moses said when he sprinkled the blood of the
covenant, by this God also promised everlasting life. All this is a
covenant. There, it was slave with master, here it is friend with
friend: there, it is said, “In the day that thou eatest thereof thou
shalt die” ([Gen. ii. 17](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#017.md)<span
id="iv.iv.vi-p35.1"></span>.); an immediate threatening; but here is
nothing of the kind. God arrives, and here is nakedness, and there was
nakedness; there, however, one that had sinned was made naked, because
he sinned, but here, one is made naked, that he may be set free. Then,
man put off the glory which he had; now, he puts off the old man; and
before going up (to the contest), puts him off as easily, as it were his
garments. <span id="fr_802"></span>[803](#fn_802.md) He is anointed, <span
id="fr_803"></span>[804](#fn_803.md) as wrestlers about to enter the lists.
For he is born at once; and as that first man was, not by little and
little, but immediately. (He is anointed,) not as the priests of old
time, on the head alone, but rather in more abundant measure. For he
indeed was anointed on the head, the right ear, the hand ([Lev.
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#023.md),
[24](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#024.md)<span
id="iv.iv.vi-p37.1"></span>.); to excite him to obedience, and to good
works; but this one, all over. For he cometh not to be instructed
merely; but to wrestle, and to be exercised; he is advanced to another
creation. For when one confesses (his belief) in the life
everlasting, <span id="fr_804"></span>[805](#fn_804.md) he has confessed a
second creation. He took dust from the earth, and formed man ([Gen. ii.
7](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#007)<span id="iv.iv.vi-p38.1"></span>..md):
but now, dust no longer, but the Holy Spirit; with This he is formed,
with this harmonized, even as Himself was in the womb of the Virgin. He
said not in Paradise, but “in Heaven.” For deem not that, because the
subject is earth, it is done on earth; he is <span
id="fr_805"></span>[806](#fn_805.md) removed thither, to Heaven, there
these things are transacted, in the midst of Angels: God taketh up thy
soul above, above He harmonizeth it anew, He placeth thee near to the
Kingly Throne. He is formed in the water, he receiveth spirit instead of
a soul. <span id="fr_806"></span>[807](#fn_806.md) And after he is formed,
He bringeth to him, not beasts, but demons, and their prince, and saith,
“Tread upon serpents and scorpions.” ([Luke x.
19](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#019)<span id="iv.iv.vi-p40.2"></span>..md)
He saith not, “Let Us make man in our image, and after our likeness”
([Gen. i. 26](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#026.md)<span
id="iv.iv.vi-p40.3"></span>.), but what? “He giveth them to become the
sons of God; but of God,” he saith, “they were born.” ([John
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#012.md),
[13](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#013)<span id="iv.iv.vi-p40.4"></span>..md)
Then that thou give no ear to the serpent, straightway he teaches thee
to say, “I renounce thee,” that is, “whatsoever thou sayest, I will not
hear thee.” Then, that he destroy thee not by means of others, it is
said, <span id="fr_807"></span>[808](#fn_807.md) “and thy pomp, and thy
service, and thy angels.” He hath set him no more to keep Paradise, but
to have his citizenship in heaven. For straightway when he cometh up he
pronounceth these words, “Our Father, Which art in Heaven,…Thy will be
done, as in Heaven, so on earth.” The plain falleth not on thy
sight, <span id="fr_808"></span>[809](#fn_808.md) thou seest not tree, nor
fountain, but straightway thou takest into thee the Lord Himself, thou
art mingled with His Body, thou art intermixed with that Body that lieth
above, whither the devil cannot approach. No woman is there, for him to
approach, and deceive as the weaker; for it is said, “There is neither
female, nor male.” ([Gal. iii. 28](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#028.md)<span
id="iv.iv.vi-p42.1"></span>.) If thou go not down to him, he will not
have power to come up where thou art; for thou art in Heaven, and Heaven
is unapproachable by the devil. It hath no tree with knowledge of good
and evil, but the Tree of Life only. No more shall woman be formed from
thy side, but we all are one from the side of Christ. For if they who
have been anointed of men take no harm by serpents, neither wilt thou
take any harm at all, so long as thou art anointed; that thou mayst be
able to grasp the Serpent and choke him, “to tread upon serpents and
scorpions.” ([Luke x. 19](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#019.md)<span
id="iv.iv.vi-p42.2"></span>.) But as the gifts are great, so is the
punishment great also. It is not possible for him that hath fallen from
Para<span id="page_288">p. 288</span> <span
id="iv.iv.vi-Page_288"></span>dise, to dwell “in front of
Paradise” <span id="fr_809"></span>[810](#fn_809.md) ([Gen. iii.
24](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#024)<span id="iv.iv.vi-p43.1"></span>..md),
nor to reascend thither from whence we have fallen. But what after this?
Hell, and the worm undying. But far be it that any of us should become
amenable to this punishment! but living virtuously, let us earnestly
strive to do throughout His will. Let us become well-pleasing to God,
that we may be able both to escape the punishment, and to obtain the
good things eternal, of which may we all be counted worthy, through the
grace and love toward man, &c.

obscure (and probably on that account omitted from some copies), but the
general meaning is not hard to find.—J.A.B.\]

<span id="iv.iv.vi-p10"></span> \[Some documents (followed by Field)
here insert, “But I am not persuaded,” probably an addition to rescue
Chrys. from the position of defending deceit. But he has done this
elaborately in his beautiful treatise on the Priesthood, employing the
same arguments and expressions as here. It is an error not surprising in
an Asiatic Greek.—J.A.B.\]

Suppl. de l’Ant. Expl. l. iii. vol. 1, p. 112, where he shows that the

like, was common in France in the thirteenth century. Such were the Dies

<span id="iv.iv.vi-p24"></span> \[The repetition of πίστεως, “of faith,”
which Field had previously conjectured as required by the sense, is

agrees better with E.V. “The handwriting \[bond\] in ordinances,” and

<span id="iv.iv.vi-p32"></span> All copies of St. Chrys. read “had them
as a hold,” which makes no sense. The Catena omits “them,” which has
been adopted, though the authority is slight. Compare [John xiv.

<span id="iv.iv.vi-p42"></span> No meaning appears in this, οὐκ ἐπ᾽ ὄψιν
πίπτει τὸ παιδίον, though old Lat. also has, “The child falleth not on
his face”; but we have only to read πεδίον, as in a doubtful passage of
Hom. xvi. on Rom. Tr. p. 467, note. This has been done in the text, not
to spoil so beautiful a passage. \[There may be a fanciful notion of the
person newly baptized and thereby regenerated (“formed in the water”) as
a child. Upon coming up and pronouncing the Lord’s Prayer, “the child
does not fall on his face.” The meaning will still be obscure, but the
whole passage is highly fanciful, and there is thus at least a possible
sense.—J.A.B.\]

id="iv.iv.vi-p42.3"></span>

<span id="iv.iv.vi-p43"></span> LXX. has κατῴκισεν αὐτὸν ἀπέναντι τοῦ
παραδείσου, “He placed him opposite Paradise.” And it is generally
thought that Adam approached the gate of Paradise to worship.
