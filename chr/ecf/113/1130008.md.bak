<span id="iii.iii.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c10"><span
id="iii.iii.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter III.</span>

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p2"></span>[Gal.
3.1](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#001.md)<span id="iii.iii.iii-p2.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p3"></span>*“O foolish Galatians* <span
id="fr_72"></span>[73](#fn_72.md) *who did bewitch you, before whose eyes
Jesus Christ was openly set forth, crucified?”*

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p5"></span><span class="c13"><span
id="iii.iii.iii-p5.1"></span>Here</span> he passes to another subject;
in the former chapters he had shown himself not to be an Apostle of men,
nor by men, nor in want of Apostolic instruction. Now, having
established his authority as a teacher, he proceeds to discourse more
confidently, and draws a comparison between faith and the Law. At the
outset he said, “I marvel that ye are so quickly removing;” ([Gal. i.
6](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#006)<span id="iii.iii.iii-p5.2"></span>..md)
but here, “O foolish Galatians;” then, his indignation was in its <span
id="page_24">p. 24</span> <span id="iii.iii.iii-Page_24"></span>birth,
but now, after his refutation of the charges against himself, and his
proofs, it bursts forth. Let not his calling them “foolish” surprise
you; for it is not a transgression of Christ’s command not to call one’s
brother a fool, but rather a strict observance of it. For it is not said
simply, “Whosoever shall say to his brother, Thou fool,” ([Mat. v.
22](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#022.md)<span
id="iii.iii.iii-p5.3"></span>.) but, whosoever shall do so, “without a
cause.” <span id="fr_73"></span>[74](#fn_73.md) And who more fittingly than
they could so be called, who after so great events, adhered to past
things, as if nothing else had ever happened? If on this account Paul is
to be called a “reviler,” Peter may likewise, on account of Annanias and
Sapphira, be called a homicide; but as it would be wildness to do so in
that case, much more in this. Moreover it is to be considered, that this
vehemence is not used at the beginning, but after these evidences and
proofs, which, rather than Paul himself, might now be held to administer
the rebuke. For after he had shown that they rejected the faith, and
made the death of Christ to be without a purpose, he introduces his
reproof, which, even as it is, is less severe than they merited. Observe
too how soon he stays his arm; for he adds not, Who has seduced you? who
has perverted you? who has been sophistical with you? but, “Who hath
cast an envious eye on you?” thus tempering his reprimand with somewhat
of praise. For it implies that their previous course had excited
jealousy, <span id="fr_74"></span>[75](#fn_74.md) and that the present
occurrence arose from the malignity of a demon, whose breath had blasted
their prosperous estate.

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p8"></span>And when you hear of jealousy in this
place, and in the Gospel, of an evil eye, which means the same, you must
not suppose that the glance of the eye has any natural power to injure
those who look upon it. For the eye, that is, the organ itself, cannot
be evil; but Christ in that place means jealousy by the term. To behold,
simply, is the function of the eye, but to behold in an evil manner
belongs to a mind depraved within. As through this sense the knowledge
of visible objects enters the soul, and as jealousy is for the most part
generated by wealth, and wealth and sovereignty and pomp are perceived
by the eye, therefore he calls the eye evil; not as beholding merely,
but as beholding enviously from some moral depravity. Therefore by the
words, “Who hath looked enviously on you,” he implies that the persons
in question acted, not from concern, not to supply defects, but to
mutilate what existed. For envy, far from supplying what is wanting,
subtracts from what is complete, and vitiates the whole. And he speaks
thus, not as if envy had any power of itself, but meaning, that the
teachers of these doctrines did so from envious motives.

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p9"></span>[Gal.
3.1](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#001.md)<span
id="iii.iii.iii-p9.1"></span>. “Before whose eyes Jesus Christ was
openly set forth, crucified.”

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p10"></span>Yet was He not crucified in Galatia,
but at Jerusalem. His reason for saying, “among you,” <span
id="fr_75"></span>[76](#fn_75.md) is to declare the power of faith to see
events which are at a distance. He says not, “crucified,” but, “openly
set forth crucified,” signifying that by the eye of faith they saw more
distinctly than some who were present as spectators. For many of the
latter received no benefit, but the former, who were not eye-witnesses,
yet saw it by faith more clearly. These words convey both praise and
blame; praise, for their implicit acceptance of the truth; blame,
because Him whom they had seen, for their sakes, stripped naked,
transfixed, nailed to the cross, spit upon, mocked, fed with vinegar,
upbraided by thieves, pierced with a spear; (for all this is implied in
the words, “openly set forth, crucified,”) <span
id="fr_76"></span>[77](#fn_76.md) Him had they left, and betaken themselves
to the Law, unshamed by any of those sufferings. Here observe how Paul,
leaving all mention of heaven, earth, and sea, every where preaches the
power of Christ, bearing about as he did, and holding up His cross: for
this is the sum of the Divine love toward us.

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p13"></span>[Gal.
3.2](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#002.md)<span
id="iii.iii.iii-p13.1"></span>. “This only would I learn from you,
Received ye the Spirit by the works of the Law, or by the hearing of
faith?”

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p14"></span>As ye do not attend, says he, to long
discourses, nor are willing to contemplate the magnitude of this
Economy, I am desirous, (seeing your extreme ignorance,) to convince you
by concise arguments and a summary method of proof. Before, he had
convinced them by what he said to Peter; now, he encounters them
entirely with arguments, drawn not from what had occurred elsewhere, but
from what had happened among themselves. <span
id="fr_77"></span>[78](#fn_77.md) And his persuasives and proofs are
adduced, not merely from what was given them in common with others, but
from what was especially conferred on themselves. Therefore he says,
“This only would I learn from you, Received ye the Spirit by the works
of the Law, or by the hearing of faith.” Ye have received, he says, the
Holy Spirit, ye <span id="page_25">p. 25</span> <span
id="iii.iii.iii-Page_25"></span>have done many mighty works, ye have
effected miracles in raising the dead, in cleansing lepers, in
prophesying, in speaking with tongues,—did the Law confer this great
power upon you? was it not rather Faith, seeing that, before, ye could
do no such things? Is it not then the height of madness for these who
have received such benefits from Faith, to abandon it, and desert back
to the Law which can offer you nothing of the same kind?

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p16"></span>[Gal.
3.3](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#003.md)<span
id="iii.iii.iii-p16.1"></span>. “Are ye so foolish? having begun in the
Spirit, are ye now perfected in the flesh?”

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p17"></span>Here again he seasonably interposes a
rebuke; time, he says, should have brought improvement; but, so far from
advancing, ye have even retrograded. Those who start from small
beginnings make progress to higher things; ye, who began with the high,
have relapsed to the low. Even had your outset been carnal, your advance
should have been spiritual, but now, after starting from things
spiritual, ye have ended your journey in that which is carnal; for to
work miracles is spiritual, but to be circumcised is carnal. And after
miracles ye have passed to circumcision, after having apprehended the
truth ye have fallen back to types, after gazing on the sun ye seek a
candle, after having strong meat ye run for milk. He says, “made
perfect,” <span id="fr_78"></span>[79](#fn_78.md) which means not
“initiated” merely, but “sacrificed,” signifying that their teachers
took and slew them like animals, while they resigned themselves to
suffer what those teachers pleased. As if some captain, or distinguished
man, after a thousand victories and trophies, were to subject himself to
infamy as a deserter, and offer his body to be branded at the will of
others.

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p19"></span>[Gal.
3.4](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#004.md)<span
id="iii.iii.iii-p19.1"></span>. “Did ye suffer so many things in
vain? <span id="fr_79"></span>[80](#fn_79.md) if it be indeed in vain.”

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p21"></span>This remark is far more piercing than
the former, for the remembrance of their miracles would not be so
powerful as the exhibition of their contests and endurance of sufferings
for Christ’s sake. All that you have endured, says he, these men would
strip you of, and would rob you of your crown. Then, lest he should
dismay and unnerve, he proceeds not to a formal judgment, but subjoins,
“if it be indeed in vain;” if you have but a mind to shake off
drowsiness and recover yourselves, he says, it is not in vain. Where
then be those who would cut off repentance <span
id="fr_80"></span>[81](#fn_80.md) ? Here were men who had received the
Spirit, worked miracles, become confessors, encountered a thousand
perils and persecutions for Christ’s sake, and after so many
achievements had fallen from grace; nevertheless he says, if ye have the
purpose, ye may recover yourselves.

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p23"></span>[Gal.
3.5](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#005.md)<span
id="iii.iii.iii-p23.1"></span>. “He therefore that supplieth to you the
Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, doeth he it by the works of the
law, or by the hearing of faith?”

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p24"></span>Have ye been vouchsafed, he says, so
great a gift, and achieved such wonders, because ye observed the Law, or
because ye adhered to Faith? plainly on account of Faith. Seeing that
they played this argument to and fro, that apart from the Law, Faith had
no force, he proves the contrary, viz., that if the Commandments be
added, Faith no longer avails; for Faith then has efficacy when things
from the Law are not added to it. “Ye who would be justified by the Law,
ye are fallen away from grace:” ([Gal. v.
4](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#004.md)<span
id="iii.iii.iii-p24.1"></span>.) This he says later, when his language
has grown bolder, employing the vantage-ground by that time gained;
meanwhile while gaining it, he argues from their past experience. For it
was when ye obeyed Faith, he says, not the Law, that ye received the
Spirit and wrought miracles.

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p25"></span>And here, as the Law was the subject
of discussion, he moots another special point of controversy, and very
opportunely and with much cogency introduces a notice of Abraham.

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p26"></span>[Gal.
3.6](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#006.md)<span
id="iii.iii.iii-p26.1"></span>. “Even as Abraham believed God, and it
was reckoned unto him for righteousness.”

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p27"></span>Even the miracles done by themselves,
he says, declare the power of Faith, but I shall attempt if you will
suffer me to draw my proofs from ancient narratives also. Then, as they
made great account of the Patriarch, he brings his example forward, and
shows that he too was justified by Faith. <span
id="fr_81"></span>[82](#fn_81.md) And if he who was before grace, was
justified by Faith, although plentiful in works, much more we. For what
loss was it to him, not being under the Law? None, for his faith
sufficed unto righteousness. The Law did not then exist, he says,
neither does it now exist, any more than then. In disproving the need of
the Law, he introduces one who was justified before the Law, lest an
objection should also be made to him; for as then it was <span
id="page_26">p. 26</span> <span id="iii.iii.iii-Page_26"></span>not yet
given, so now, having been given, it was abrogated. And as they made
much of their descent from Abraham, and feared lest, abandoning the Law,
they should be considered strangers to his kin; Paul removes this fear
by turning their argument against themselves, and proves that faith is
especially concerned in connecting them with Abraham. He draws out this
argument more at length in the Epistle to the Romans; however he urges
it also here in, the words,

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p29"></span>[Gal.
3.7](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#007.md)<span
id="iii.iii.iii-p29.1"></span>. “Know therefore, that they which be of
faith, the same are sons of Abraham.”

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p30"></span>Which he proves by ancient testimony
thus:

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p31"></span>[Gal.
3.8](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#008.md)<span
id="iii.iii.iii-p31.1"></span>. “And the Scripture, <span
id="fr_82"></span>[83](#fn_82.md) foreseeing that God would justify the
Gentiles by faith, preached the Gospel beforehand unto Abraham, saying,
In thee shall all the nations be blessed.”

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p33"></span>If then those were Abraham’s sons,
not, who were related to him by blood, but who follow his faith, for
this is the meaning of the words, “In thee all the nations,” it is plain
that the heathen are brought into kindred with him.

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p34"></span>Hereby too is proved another important
point. It perplexed them that the Law was the older, and Faith
afterwards. Now he removes this notion by showing that Faith was
anterior to the Law; as is evident from Abraham’s case, who was
justified before the giving of the Law. He shows too that late events
fell out according to prophecy; “The Scripture,” says he, “foreseeing
that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the Gospel
beforehand unto Abraham.” Attend to this point. He Himself who gave the
Law, had decreed, before He gave it, that the heathen should be
justified by Faith. And he says not “revealed,” but, “preached the
Gospel,” to signify that the patriarch was in joy at this method of
justification, and in great desire for its accomplishment.

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p35"></span>Further, they were possessed with
another apprehension; it was written, “Cursed is every one that
continueth not in all things that are written in the book of the Law, to
do them.” ([Deut. xxvii. 26](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#026.md)<span
id="iii.iii.iii-p35.1"></span>.) And this he removes, with great skill
and prudence, turning their argument against themselves, and showing
that those who relinquish the Law are not only not cursed, but blessed;
and they who keep it, not only not blessed but cursed. They said that he
who kept not the Law was cursed, but he proves that he who kept it was
cursed, and he who kept it not, blessed. Again, they said that he who
adhered to Faith alone was cursed, but he shows that he who adhered to
Faith alone, is blessed. And how does he prove all this? for it is no
common thing which we have promised; wherefore it is necessary to give
close attention to what follows. He had already shown this, by referring
to the words spoken to the Patriarch, “In thee shall all nations be
blessed,” ([Gen. xii. 4](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#004.md)<span
id="iii.iii.iii-p35.2"></span>.) at a time, that is, when Faith existed,
not the Law; so he adds by way of conclusion,

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p36"></span>[Gal.
3.9](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#009.md)<span
id="iii.iii.iii-p36.1"></span>. “So then they which be of faith are
blessed with the faithful Abraham.” <span id="fr_83"></span>[84](#fn_83.md)

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p38"></span>Then, that they might not turn round,
and object that, true it was Abraham was justified by Faith, for the Law
was not then given, but what instance would be found of Faith justifying
after the delivery of the Law? he addresses himself to this, and proves
more than they required: namely, not only that Faith was justifying, but
that the Law brought its adherents under a curse. To be sure of this,
listen to the very words of the Apostle.

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p39"></span>[Gal.
3.10](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#010.md)<span
id="iii.iii.iii-p39.1"></span>. “For <span
id="fr_84"></span>[85](#fn_84.md) as many as are of the works of the Law
are under a curse.”

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p42"></span>This is what he lays down, before
proving it; and what is the proof? it is from the Law itself:—

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p43"></span>[Gal.
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#010.md),
[11](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#011.md)<span
id="iii.iii.iii-p43.1"></span>. “For it is written, Cursed is every one
that continueth not in all things that are written in the book of the
Law to do them. Now that no man is justified by the Law is evident.”

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p44"></span>For all have sinned, and are under the
curse. However he does not say this yet, lest he should seem to lay it
down of himself, but here again establishes his point by a text which
concisely states both points; that no man has fulfilled the Law,
(wherefore they are under the curse,) and, that Faith justifies. What
then is the text? It is in the book of the prophet Habakkuk, “The just
shall live by faith,” ([Hab. ii.
4](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#004.md)<span
id="iii.iii.iii-p44.1"></span>.) which not only establishes the
righteousness that is of Faith, but also that there is no salvation
through the Law. As no one, he says, kept the Law, but all were under
the curse, on account of transgression, an easy way was provided, that
from Faith, which is in itself a strong proof that no man can be
justified by the Law. For the prophet says not, “The just shall live by
the Law,” but, “by faith:”

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p45"></span>[Gal.
3.12](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#012.md)<span
id="iii.iii.iii-p45.1"></span>. “And the Law is not of faith; but He
that doeth them shall live in them.”

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p46"></span>For the Law requires not only Faith
but works also, but grace saves and justifies by Faith. ([Eph. ii.
8](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#008.md)<span
id="iii.iii.iii-p46.1"></span>.)

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p47"></span><span id="page_27">p. 27</span> <span
id="iii.iii.iii-Page_27"></span>You see how he proves that they are
under the curse who cleave to the Law, because it is impossible to
fulfill it; next, how comes Faith to have this justifying power? for to
this doctrine he already stood pledged, and now maintains it with great
force of argument. The Law being too weak to lead man to righteousness,
an effectual remedy was provided in Faith, which is the means of
rendering that possible which was “impossible by the Law.” ([Rom. viii.
3](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#003.md)<span
id="iii.iii.iii-p47.1"></span>.) Now as the Scripture says, “the just
shall live by faith,” thus repudiating salvation by the Law, and
moreover as Abraham was justified by Faith, it is evident that its
efficacy is very great. And it is also clear, that he who abides not by
the Law is cursed, and that he who keeps to Faith is just. But, you may
ask me, how I prove that this curse is not still of force? Abraham lived
before the Law, but we, who once were subject to the yoke of bondage,
have made ourselves liable to the curse; and who shall release us
therefrom? Observe his ready answer to this; his former remark was
sufficient; for, if a man be once justified, and has died to the Law and
embraced a novel life, how can such a one be subject to the curse?
however, this is not enough for him, so he begins with a fresh argument,
as follows:—

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p48"></span>[Gal.
3.13](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#013.md)<span
id="iii.iii.iii-p48.1"></span>. “Christ redeemed us from the curse of
the Law, having become a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is
every one that hangeth on a tree.” <span id="fr_85"></span>[86](#fn_85.md)

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p50"></span>In reality, the people were subject to
another curse, which says, “Cursed is every one that continueth not in
the things that are written in the book of the Law.” ([Deut. xxvii.
26](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#026.md)<span
id="iii.iii.iii-p50.1"></span>.) To this curse, I say, people were
subject, for no man had continued in, or was a keeper of, the whole Law;
but Christ exchanged this curse for the other, “Cursed is every one that
hangeth on a tree.” As then both he who hanged on a tree, and he who
transgresses the Law, is cursed, and as it was necessary for him who is
about to relieve from a curse himself to be free from it, but to receive
another instead of it, therefore Christ took upon Him such another, and
thereby relieved us from the curse. It was like an innocent man’s
undertaking to die for another sentenced to death, and so rescuing him
from punishment. For Christ took upon Him not the curse of
transgression, but the other curse, in order to remove that of others.
For, “He had done no violence neither was any deceit in His mouth.”
([Isa. 53:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#009.md), [1 Pet.
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#022.md)<span
id="iii.iii.iii-p50.2"></span>.) And as by dying He rescued from death
those who were dying, so by taking upon Himself the curse, He delivered
them from it.

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p51"></span>[Gal.
3.14](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#014.md)<span
id="iii.iii.iii-p51.1"></span>. “That upon the Gentiles might come the
blessing of Abraham.”

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p52"></span>How on the Gentiles? It is said, “In
thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed:” ([Gen.
22:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#018.md), [Gen.
26:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#004.md)<span
id="iii.iii.iii-p52.1"></span>.) that is to say, in Christ. If this were
said of the Jews, how would it be reasonable that they who were
themselves subject to the curse, on account of transgression, should
become the authors of a blessing to others? an accursed person cannot
impart to others that blessing of which he is himself deprived. Plainly
then it all refers to Christ who was the Seed of Abraham, and through
whom the Gentiles are blessed. And thus the promise of the Spirit is
added, as Paul himself declares, “that we might receive the promise of
the Spirit through faith.” <span id="fr_86"></span>[87](#fn_86.md) As the
grace of the Spirit could not possibly descend on the graceless and
offending, they are first blessed the curse having been removed; then
being justified by faith, they draw unto themselves the grace of the
Spirit. Thus the Cross removed the curse, Faith brought in
righteousness, righteousness drew on the grace of the Spirit.

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p54"></span>[Gal.
3.15](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#015.md)<span
id="iii.iii.iii-p54.1"></span>. “Brethren, I speak after the manner of
men; Though it be but a man’s covenant, yet when it hath been confirmed,
no one maketh it void or addeth thereto.”

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p55"></span>“To speak after the manner of men”
means to use human examples. <span id="fr_87"></span>[88](#fn_87.md) Having
founded his argument on the Scriptures, on the miracles wrought among
themselves, on the sufferings of Christ, and on the Patriarch, he
proceeds to common usages; and this he does invariably, in order to
sweeten his discourse, and render it more acceptable and intelligible to
the duller sort. Thus he argues with the Corinthians, “Who feedeth a
flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock? Who planteth a vineyard,
and eateth not the fruit thereof?” ([1 Cor. ix.
7](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#007.md)<span
id="iii.iii.iii-p56.1"></span>.) and again with the Hebrews, “For a
testament is of force where there hath been death; for doth it ever
avail while he that made it liveth?” ([Heb. ix.
17](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#017.md)<span
id="iii.iii.iii-p56.2"></span>.) One may find him dwelling with pleasure
on such arguments. In the Old Testament God does the same thing in many
instances, as, “Can a woman forget her sucking child?” ([Isa. xlix.
15](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#015.md)<span
id="iii.iii.iii-p56.3"></span>.) and again, “Shall the clay say to him
that fashioneth it, What makest thou?” ([Isa. xlv.
9](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#009.md)<span
id="iii.iii.iii-p56.4"></span>.) and in Hosea, He represents a husband
set at nought by his wife. ([Hos. ii.
5](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#005.md)<span id="iii.iii.iii-p56.5"></span>,
f) This use of human <span id="page_28">p. 28</span> <span
id="iii.iii.iii-Page_28"></span>examples frequently occurs in types
also, as when the prophet takes the girdle, ([Jer. xiii.
1-9](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#001.md)<span
id="iii.iii.iii-p56.6"></span>.) and goes down to the potter’s house
([Jer. xviii. 1-6](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#001.md)<span
id="iii.iii.iii-p56.7"></span>.) The meaning of the present example is,
that Faith is more ancient than the Law, which is later and only
temporary, and delivered in order to pave the way for Faith. Hence he
says, “Brethren, I speak after the manner of men;” above he had called
them “foolish,” now he calls them “brethren,” at once chiding and
encouraging them. “Though it be but a man’s covenant, yet when it hath
been confirmed.” If a man, says he, makes a covenant, does any one dare
to come afterwards and overturn it, or subjoin aught to it? for this is
the meaning of “or addeth thereto.” Much less then when God makes a
covenant; and with whom did God make a covenant?

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p57"></span>[Gal.
3.16-18](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#016.md)<span
id="iii.iii.iii-p57.1"></span>. “Now to Abraham were the promises spoken
and to his seed. He saith not, And to seeds, <span
id="fr_88"></span>[89](#fn_88.md) as of many; but as of One, And to thy
seed, which is Christ. <span id="fr_89"></span>[90](#fn_89.md) Now this I
say, A covenant, confirmed before hand by God the Law, which came four
hundred and thirty years after, doth not disannul, so as to make the
promise of none effect. For if the inheritance is of the Law, it is no
more of promise: but God hath granted it to Abraham by promise.”

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p60"></span>Thus God made a covenant with Abraham,
promising that in his seed the blessing should come upon the heathen;
and this blessing the Law cannot turn aside. As this example was not in
all respects appropriate to the matter in hand, he introduces it thus,
“I speak after the manner of men,” that nothing might be deduced from it
derogatory to the majesty of God. But let us go to the bottom of this
illustration. It was promised Abraham that by his seed the heathen
should be blessed; and his seed according to the flesh is Christ; four
hundred and thirty years after came the Law; now, if the Law bestows the
blessings even life and righteousness, that promise is annulled. And so
while no one annuls a man’s covenant, the covenant of God after four
hundred and thirty years is annulled; for if not that covenant but
another instead of it bestows what is promised, then is it set aside,
which is most unreasonable.

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p61"></span>[Gal.
3.19](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#019.md)<span
id="iii.iii.iii-p61.1"></span>. “What then is the Law? it was added
because of transgressions.”

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p62"></span>This remark again is not superfluous;
observe too how he glances round at every thing, as if he had an hundred
eyes. Having exalted Faith, and proved its elder claims, that the Law
may not be considered superfluous, he sets right this side of the
doctrine also, and proves that the Law was not given without a view, but
altogether profitably. “Because of transgressions;” that is to say, that
the Jews might not be let live carelessly, and plunge into the depth of
wickedness, <span id="fr_90"></span>[91](#fn_90.md) but that the Law might
be placed upon them as a bridle, guiding, regulating, and checking them
from transgressing, if not all, at least some of the commandments. Not
slight then was the advantage of the Law; but for how long?

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p64"></span>[Gal.
3.19](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#019.md)<span
id="iii.iii.iii-p64.1"></span>. “Till the seed should come to whom the
promise hath been made.”

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p65"></span>This is said of Christ; if then it was
given until His advent, why do you protract it beyond its natural
period?

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p66"></span>[Gal.
3.19](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#019.md)<span
id="iii.iii.iii-p66.1"></span>. “And it was ordained through Angels by
the hand of a Mediator.”

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p67"></span>He either calls the priests Angels, or
he declares that the Angels themselves ministered to the delivery of the
Law. By Mediator here he means Christ, <span
id="fr_91"></span>[92](#fn_91.md) and shows that He was before it, and
Himself the Giver of it.

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p69"></span>[Gal.
3.20](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#020.md)<span
id="iii.iii.iii-p69.1"></span>. “Now a mediator is not a mediator of
one, but God is one.” <span id="fr_92"></span>[93](#fn_92.md)

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p72"></span>What can the heretics <span
id="fr_93"></span>[94](#fn_93.md) say to this? for as, according to them,
the expression “the Only True God” excludes the Son from being true God,
so here the phrase “God is One,” excludes Him from being God in any
sense. But if, although the Father is called “One God,” the Son is
nevertheless God, it is very plain that though the Father is called
“Very God,” the Son is very God likewise. Now a mediator, says he, is
between two parties; of whom then is Christ the Mediator? plainly of God
and of men. Observe, he says, that Christ also gave the Law; what
therefore it was His to give, it is His to annul.

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p74"></span><span id="page_29">p. 29</span> <span
id="iii.iii.iii-Page_29"></span>[Gal.
3.21](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#021.md)<span
id="iii.iii.iii-p74.1"></span>. “Is the Law then against the promises of
God?”

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p75"></span>For if the blessing is given in the
seed of Abraham, but the Law brings in the curse, it must be contrary to
the promises. This objection he meets, first, by a protest, in the
words,

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p76"></span>[Gal.
3.21](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#021.md)<span
id="iii.iii.iii-p76.1"></span>. “God forbid:”

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p77"></span>And next he brings his proof;

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p78"></span>[Gal.
3.21](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#021.md)<span
id="iii.iii.iii-p78.1"></span>. “For if there had been a law given which
could make alive verily righteousness would have been of the Law.”

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p79"></span>His meaning is as follows; If we had
our hope of life in the Law, and our salvation depended on it, the
objection might be valid. But if it save you, by means of Faith, though
it brings you under the curse, you suffer nothing from it, gain no harm,
in that Faith comes and sets all right. Had the promise been by the Law,
you had reasonably feared lest, separating from the Law, you should
separate from righteousness, but if it was given in order to shut up
all, that is, to convince all and expose their individual sins, far from
excluding you from the promises, it now aids you in obtaining them. This
is shown by the words,

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p80"></span>[Gal.
3.22](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#022.md)<span
id="iii.iii.iii-p80.1"></span>. “Howbeit the scripture <span
id="fr_94"></span>[95](#fn_94.md) hath shut up all things under sin, that
the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to them that
believe.”

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p82"></span>As the Jews were not even conscious of
their own sins, and in consequence did not even desire remission; the
Law was given to probe their wounds, that they might long for a
physician. And the word “shut up” means “convinced” and conviction held
them in fear. You see then it is not only not against, but was given for
the promises. Had it arrogated to itself the work and the authority, the
objection would stand; but if its drift is something else, and it acted
for that, how is it against the promises of God? Had the Law not been
given, all would have been wrecked upon wickedness, and there would have
been no Jews to listen to Christ; but now being given, it has effected
two things; it has schooled its followers in a certain degree of virtue,
and has pressed on them the knowledge of their own sins. And this
especially made them more zealous to seek the Son, for those who
disbelieved, disbelieved from having no sense of their own sins, as Paul
shows; “For being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and seeking to
establish their own righteousness, they did not subject themselves to
the righteousness of God.” ([Rom. x.
3](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#003.md)<span
id="iii.iii.iii-p82.1"></span>.)

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p83"></span>[Gal.
3.23](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#023.md)<span
id="iii.iii.iii-p83.1"></span>. “But before faith came, we were kept
inward under the Law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be
revealed.”

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p84"></span>Here he clearly puts forward what I
have stated: for the expressions “we were kept” and “shut up,” signify
nothing else than the security given by the commandments of the Law;
which like a fortress fenced them round with fear and a life conformable
to itself, and so preserved them unto Faith.

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p85"></span>[Gal.
3.24](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#024.md)<span
id="iii.iii.iii-p85.1"></span>. “So that the Law hath been our tutor to
bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.”

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p86"></span>Now the Tutor is not opposed to the
Preceptor, but cooperates with him, ridding the youth from all vice, and
having all leisure to fit him for receiving instructions from his
Preceptor. But when the youth’s habits are formed, then the Tutor leaves
him, as Paul says.

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p87"></span>[Gal.
3:25](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#025.md),
[26](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#026.md)<span
id="iii.iii.iii-p87.1"></span>. “But now that faith is come which leads
to perfect manhood we are no longer under a tutor <span
id="fr_95"></span>[96](#fn_95.md) . For ye are all sons of God through
faith in Christ Jesus.”

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p89"></span>The Law then, as it was our tutor, and
we were kept shut up under it, is not the adversary but the
fellow-worker of grace; but if when grace is come, it continues to hold
us down, it becomes an adversary; for if it confines those who ought to
go forward to grace, then it is the destruction of our salvation. If a
candle which gave light by night, kept us, when it became day, from the
sun, it would not only not benefit, it would injure us; and so doth the
Law, if it stands between us and greater benefits. Those then are the
greatest traducers of the Law, who still keep it, just as the tutor
makes a youth ridiculous, by retaining him with himself, when time calls
for his departure. Hence Paul says, “But after faith is come, we are no
longer under a tutor.” We are then no longer under a tutor, “for ye are
all sons of God.” Wonderful! see how mighty is the power of Faith, and
how he unfolds as he proceeds! Before, he showed that it made them sons
of the Patriarch, “Know therefore,” says he, “that they which be of
faith, the same are sons of Abraham;” now he proves that they are sons
of God also, “For ye are all,” says he, “sons of God through faith,
which is in Christ Jesus;” by Faith, not by the Law. Then, when he has
said this <span id="page_30">p. 30</span> <span
id="iii.iii.iii-Page_30"></span>great and wonderful thing, he names also
the mode of their adoption,

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p90"></span>[Gal.
3.27](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#027.md)<span
id="iii.iii.iii-p90.1"></span>. “For as many of you as were baptized
into Christ, did put on Christ.”

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p91"></span>Why does he not say, “For as many of
you as have been baptized into Christ, have been born of God?” for this
was what directly went to prove that they were sons;—because he states
it in a much more awful point of view; If Christ be the Son of God, and
thou hast put on Him, thou who hast the Son within thee, and art
fashioned after His pattern, hast been brought into one kindred and
nature with Him.

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p92"></span>[Gal.
3.28](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#028.md)<span
id="iii.iii.iii-p92.1"></span>. “There can be neither Jew nor Greek,
there can be neither bond nor free, there can be no male and female: for
ye all are one in Christ Jesus.”

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p93"></span>See what an insatiable soul! for
having said, “We are all made children of God through Faith,” he does
not stop there, but tries to find something more exact, which may serve
to convey a still closer oneness with Christ. Having said, “ye have put
on Christ,” even this does not suffice Him, but by way of penetrating
more deeply into this union, he comments on it thus: “Ye are all One in
Christ Jesus,” that is, ye have all one form and one mould, even
Christ’s. What can be more awful than these words! He that was a Greek,
or Jew, or bond-man yesterday, carries about with him the form, not of
an Angel or Archangel, but of the Lord of all, yea displays in his own
person the Christ.

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p94"></span>[Gal.
3.29](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#029.md)<span
id="iii.iii.iii-p94.1"></span>. “And if ye are Christ’s, then are ye
Abraham’s seed, heirs according to promise.”

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p95"></span>Here, you observe, he proves what he
had before stated concerning the seed of Abraham,—that to him and to his
seed the promises were given. <span id="fr_96"></span>[97](#fn_96.md)

context, and is thus forcibly put by him: “The law is of the nature of a
contract between two parties. God on the one hand and the Jewish people
on the other. It is valid only so long as both parties fulfil the terms
of contract. It is therefore contingent and not absolute. Unlike the law
the promise is absolute and unconditional. It depends on the sole decree
of God. There are not two contracting parties. There is nothing of the
nature of a stipulation. The giver is everything and the recipient
nothing.”—Com. *in loco*.—G.A.\]

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p73"></span> The heretics refered to are the
Anomœans, who held Arianism in its most developed form, against whom S.
Chrysostom has written Homilies. For the particular objection answered
in the text, vid. also Basil, in *Eunom*, iv. p. 294. *Athan.* Or *in
Arian*, iii. 9. Greg. *Naz. Orat*. 36, p. 586.

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p81"></span> \[“The Law then though differing
widely from the promise is not antagonistic to it, does not interfere
with it. On the contrary, we might imagine such a law as would justify
and give life. This was not the effect of the law of Moses, however; on
the contrary (<span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.iii.iii-p81.1"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.iii.iii-p81.2"></span>λλὰ</span>) the Scripture (that, namely,
about the curse, [Gal. 3.10](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#010.md)<span
id="iii.iii.iii-p81.3"></span>:) testifies that the Law condemned all
alike, yet not finally and irrevocably but only as leading the way for
the dispensation of faith.”—Lightfoot. Meyer takes a different view of
[Gal. 3.21](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#021.md)<span
id="iii.iii.iii-p81.4"></span>: “For if it had been opposed to the
promises, the Law must have been in a position to procure life and if
this were so, then would righteousness actually be from the Law, which
according to the Scripture cannot be so ([Gal.
3.22](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#022.md)<span
id="iii.iii.iii-p81.5"></span>.)”—G.A.\]

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p88"></span> \[“The pædagogus or tutor, frequently
a superior slave, was entrusted with the moral supervision of the child.
Thus his office was quite distinct from that of the <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.iii.iii-p88.1"></span>διδάσκαλος</span>; so
the word “Schoolmaster” conveys a wrong idea. As well in his inferior
rank as in his recognized duty of enforcing discipline, this person was
a fit emblem of the Mosaic law. There is a very complete illustration of
the use which Paul makes of the metaphor in Plato (*Lysis*, p, 208
C).”—Lightfoot.—G.A.\]

3.16](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#016.md)<span
id="iii.iii.iii-p96.1"></span> must here be kept in view where Christ is
declared to be the seed of Abraham. Union with Christ constitutes the
true spiritual descent from Abraham and secures the inheritance of all
the Messianic blessings by promise as against inheritance by law.” *Pop.
Com.* *in loc.*—G.A.\]
