<span id="iii.iv.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c10"><span
id="iii.iv.ix-p1.1"></span>Homily VIII.</span>

<span id="iii.iv.ix-p2"></span>[Eph.
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#001.md),
[2](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#002.md)<span id="iii.iv.ix-p2.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iv.ix-p3"></span>“I therefore, the prisoner in the Lord,
beseech you to walk worthily of the calling wherewith ye were called,
with all lowliness and meekness.”

<span id="iii.iv.ix-p4"></span><span class="c13"><span
id="iii.iv.ix-p4.1"></span>It</span> is the virtue of teachers to aim
not at praise, nor at esteem from those under their authority, but at
their salvation, and to do every thing with this object; since the man
who should make the other end his aim, would not be a teacher but a
tyrant. Surely it is not for this that God set thee over them, that thou
shouldest enjoy greater court and service, but that thine own interests
should be disregarded, and every one of theirs built up. This is a
teacher’s duty: such an one was the blessed Paul, a man who was free
from all manner of vanity, and was contented to be one of the many, nay
more, to be the very least even of them. Hence he even calls himself
their servant, and so generally speaks in a tone of supplication.
Observe him then even now writing nothing dictatorial, nothing
imperious, but all chastened and subdued.

<span id="iii.iv.ix-p5"></span>“I therefore,” saith he, “the prisoner in
the Lord, beseech you to walk worthily of the calling wherewith ye were
called.” What is it, tell me, thou art beseeching? Is it that thou
mayest gain any end for thyself? No, saith he, in no wise; it is that I
may save others. And yet surely they who beseech, do so for things which
are of importance to themselves. True; and this, saith he, is of
importance to myself, according to what he says also elsewhere in his
writings, “Now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord;” ([1 Thess. iii.
8](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#008)<span id="iii.iv.ix-p5.1"></span>..md)
for he ever earnestly desired the salvation of those whom he was
instructing.

<span id="iii.iv.ix-p6"></span>“I, the prisoner in the Lord.” Great and
mighty dignity! Greater than that of king or of consul, or of any other.
Hence it is the very title he uses in writing to Philemon, “As Paul the
<span id="page_85">p. 85</span> <span
id="iii.iv.ix-Page_85"></span>aged, and now a prisoner also of Jesus
Christ.” ([Philemon 9](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#009.md)<span
id="iii.iv.ix-p6.1"></span>.) For nothing is so glorious as a bond for
Christ’s sake, as the chains that were bound around those holy hands;
more glorious is it to be a prisoner for Christ’s sake than to be an
Apostle, than to be a Teacher, than to be an Evangelist. Is there any
that loveth Christ, he will understand what I am saying. Is any
transported and fired with devotion for the Lord, he knows the power of
these bonds. Such an one would rather choose to be a prisoner for
Christ’s sake, than to have the Heavens for his dwelling. More glorious
than any gold were the hands he was showing to them, yea, than any royal
diadem. Yes, no jewelled tiara bound around the head invests it with
such glory, as an iron chain for Christ’s sake. Then was the prison more
glorious than palaces, yea, than heaven itself. Why say I than palaces?
Because it contained a prisoner of Christ. Is there any that loveth
Christ, he knows the dignity of this title, he knows what a virtue is
this, he knows how great a boon he bestowed upon mankind, even this, to
be bound for His sake. More glorious this, perhaps to be bound for His
sake, than “to sit at His right hand,” ([Matt. xx.
21](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#021)<span id="iii.iv.ix-p6.2"></span>..md)
more august this, than to “sit upon the twelve thrones.” ([Matt. xix.
28](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#028)<span id="iii.iv.ix-p6.3"></span>..md)

<span id="iii.iv.ix-p7"></span>And why speak I of human glories? I am
ashamed to compare earthly riches and golden attire to these bonds. But
forbearing to speak of those great and heavenly glories, even were the
thing attended with no reward at all, this alone were a great reward,
this an ample recompense, to suffer these hardships for the sake of the
Beloved. They that love, even though it be not God, but man, they know
what I am saying, since they are more delighted to suffer for, than to
be honored by those they love. But to fully understand these things
belongs to the holy company, the Apostles, I mean, and them alone. For
hearken to what the blessed Luke saith, ([Acts v.
11](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#011)<span id="iii.iv.ix-p7.1"></span>..md)
“that they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that
they were counted worthy to suffer dishonor for the Name.” To all others
indeed it seems to be foolishness, that to suffer dishonor is to be
counted worthy, that to suffer dishonor is to rejoice. But to them that
understand the love of Christ, this is esteemed of all things the most
blessed. Were any to offer me my choice, the whole Heaven or that chain,
that chain I would prefer. Were any to ask whether he should place me on
high with the Angels, or with Paul in his bonds, the prison I would
choose. Were any about to change me into one of those powers, that are
in Heaven, that are round about the throne, or into such a prisoner as
this, such a prisoner I would choose to be. Nothing is more blessed than
that chain. Would that I could be at this moment in that very spot, (for
the bonds are said to be still in existence,) to behold and admire those
men, for their love of Christ. Would that I could behold the chains, at
which the devils fear and tremble, but which Angels reverence. Nothing
is more noble than to suffer any evil for Christ’s sake. I count not
Paul so happy, because he was “caught up into Paradise,” ([2 Cor. xii.
4](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#004)<span id="iii.iv.ix-p7.2"></span>..md)
as because he was cast into the dungeon; I count him not so happy,
because he heard “unspeakable words,” as because he endured those bonds.
I count him not so happy, because he was “caught up into the third
Heaven,” ([2 Cor. xii. 2](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#002.md)<span
id="iii.iv.ix-p7.3"></span>.) as I count him happy for those bonds’
sake. For that these are greater than those, hear how even he himself
knew this; for he saith not, I who “heard unspeakable words,” beseech
you: but what? “I, the prisoner in the Lord, beseech you.” Nor yet are
we to wonder, though he inscribes not this in all his Epistles, for he
was not always in prison, but only at certain times.

<span id="iii.iv.ix-p8"></span>I deem it more desirable to suffer evil
for Christ’s sake, than to receive honor at Christ’s hands. This is
transcendent honor, this is glory that surpasseth all things. If He
Himself who became a servant for my sake, and “emptied” ([Philip. ii.
7](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#007)<span id="iii.iv.ix-p8.1"></span>..md)
His glory, yet thought not Himself so truly in glory, as when He was
crucified for my sake, what ought not I to endure? For hear His own
words: “Father, glorify Thou Me.” ([John xvii.
1](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#001)<span id="iii.iv.ix-p8.2"></span>..md)
What is this thou art saying? Thou art being led to the cross with
thieves and plunderers of graves, thou endurest the death of the
accursed; Thou art about to be spit upon and buffeted; and callest Thou
this glory? <span id="fr_259"></span>[260](#fn_259.md) Yes, He saith, for I
suffer these things for My beloved ones, and I count them altogether
glory. If He who loved the miserable and wretched calleth this glory,
not to be on His Father’s throne, nor in His Father’s glory, but in
dishonor,—if this was His glory, and if this He set before the other:
much more ought I to regard these things as glory. Oh! those blessed
bonds! Oh! those blessed hands which that chain adorned! Not so worthy
were Paul’s hands when they lifted up and raised the lame man at Lystra,
as when they were bound around with those chains. Had I been living in
those times, how eagerly would I have embraced them, and put them to the
very apple of mine eyes. Never would I have ceased kissing those hands
which were counted worthy to be bound for my Lord. Marvellest thou at
Paul, when the viper fastened on his hand, and did him no hurt? Marvel
not. It reverenced his chain. Yea, and the whole sea reverenced it; for
then too <span id="page_86">p. 86</span> <span
id="iii.iv.ix-Page_86"></span>was he bound, when he was saved from
shipwreck. Were any one to grant me power to raise the dead at this
moment, I would not choose that power, but this chain. Were I free from
the cares of the Church, had I my body strong and vigorous, I would not
shrink from undertaking so long a journey, only for the sake of
beholding those chains, for the sake of seeing the prison where he was
bound. The traces indeed of his miracles are numerous in all parts of
the world, yet are they not so dear as those of his scars. ([Gal. vi.
17](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#017)<span id="iii.iv.ix-p9.2"></span>..md)
Nor in the Scriptures does he so delight me when he is working miracles,
as when he is suffering evil, being scourged, and dragged about.
Insomuch that from his body were carried away handkerchiefs or aprons.
Marvellous, truly marvellous, are these things, and yet not so
marvellous as those. “When they had laid many stripes upon him, they
cast him into prison.” ([Acts xvi.
23](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#023)<span id="iii.iv.ix-p9.3"></span>..md)
And again; being in bonds, “they were singing hymns unto God.” ([Acts
xvi. 25](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#025.md)<span
id="iii.iv.ix-p9.4"></span>.) And again; “They stoned him, and dragged
him out of the city, supposing that he was dead.” ([Acts xiv.
19](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#019)<span id="iii.iv.ix-p9.5"></span>..md)
Would ye know how mighty a thing is an iron chain for Christ’s sake,
bound about His servant’s body? Hearken to what Christ Himself saith,
“Blessed are ye.” ([Mat. v. 11](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#011.md)<span
id="iii.iv.ix-p9.6"></span>.) Why? When ye shall raise the dead? No. But
why? When ye shall heal the blind? Not at all. But why then? “When men
shall reproach you, and persecute you, and say all manner of evil
against you falsely for My sake.” ([Matt. v.
11](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#011)<span id="iii.iv.ix-p9.7"></span>..md)
Now, if to be evil spoken of renders men thus blessed, to be evil
entreated, what may not that achieve? Hearken to what this blessed one
himself saith elsewhere; “Henceforth there is laid up for me the crown
of righteousness:” ([2 Tim. iv. 8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#008.md)<span
id="iii.iv.ix-p9.8"></span>.) and yet, more glorious than this crown is
the chain: of this, saith he, the Lord will count me worthy, and I am in
no wise inquisitive about those things. Enough it is for me for every
recompense, to suffer evil for Christ’s sake. Let Him but grant me to
say, that “I fill up that which is lacking of the afflictions of
Christ:” ([Col. i. 24](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#024.md)<span
id="iii.iv.ix-p9.9"></span>.) and I ask nothing further.

<span id="iii.iv.ix-p10"></span>Peter also was counted worthy of this
chain; for he, we read, was bound, and delivered to soldiers, and was
sleeping. ([Acts xii. 6](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#006.md)<span
id="iii.iv.ix-p10.1"></span>.) Yet he rejoiced and was not diverted from
his right mind and he fell into deep sleep which could not have been,
had he been in any great anxiety. However, he was sleeping, being
between two soldiers: and an Angel came unto him, and smote him on the
side, and raised him up. Now then, were any one to say to me, Which
wouldest thou? Wouldest thou be the Angel that struck Peter, or Peter
that was delivered? I would rather choose to be Peter, for whose sake
even the Angel came, yea, I would that I might enjoy those chains. And
how is it, say ye, that, as being released from great evils, he prays?
Marvel not: he prays, because he is afraid lest he should die; and of
dying he is afraid, because he would fain have his life to be still a
subject for further sufferings. For hearken to what the blessed Paul
himself also saith. ([Phil. 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#023.md),
[24](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#024.md)<span
id="iii.iv.ix-p10.2"></span>.) “To depart, and to be with Christ, is
very far better;” “Yet to abide in the flesh is more needful for your
sake.” This he calls even a favor where he writes, and says, “To you it
hath been granted, (as a favor <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.iv.ix-p10.3"></span>ἕ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.iv.ix-p10.4"></span>χαρίσθη</span>) in the behalf of Christ, not
only to believe on Him, but also to suffer in His behalf.” ([Philip. i.
29](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#029)<span id="iii.iv.ix-p10.5"></span>..md)
So that this latter is greater than the other: for He gave it of His
free grace; verily, a favor it is, exceeding great, yea greater than any
one of those, greater than to make the sun and the moon stand still,
than to move the world! greater this than to have power over devils, or
to cast out devils. The devils grieve not so much at being cast out by
the faith which we exert, as when they behold us suffering any evil, and
imprisoned for Christ’s sake. For this increases our boldness. Not for
this is it a noble thing to be in bonds for Christ’s sake that it
procures for us a kingdom; it is that it is done for Christ’s sake. Not
for this do I bless those bonds, for that they conduct on to Heaven; it
is because they are worn for the sake of the Lord of Heaven. How great a
boast to know that he was bound for Christ’s sake! How great a
happiness, how high an honor, how illustrious a distinction! Fain would
I ever be dwelling on these subjects. Fain would I cling to this chain.
Fain would I, though in reality I have not the power, yet still in idea,
bind this chain round my soul by a temper like his.

<span id="iii.iv.ix-p11"></span>“The foundations of the prison-house,”
we read, “were shaken” where Paul was bound, “and every one’s bands were
loosed.” ([Acts xvi. 26](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#026.md)<span
id="iii.iv.ix-p11.1"></span>.) Beholdest thou then in bonds a nature
that can dissolve bonds themselves? for as the Lord’s death put death
itself to death, so also did Paul’s bonds loose the men in bonds, shake
the house of bondage, open the doors. Yet is not this the natural effect
of bonds, but the very reverse; it is to keep him that is bound in
safety, not to open for him the prison walls. No, of bonds then in
general this is not the nature, but of those bonds which are for
Christ’s sake, it is. “The jailor fell down before Paul and Silas.”
([Acts xvi. 29](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#029.md)<span
id="iii.iv.ix-p11.2"></span>.) And yet neither is this again the effect
of chains in general, to lay the binders at the feet of the bound: no,
but, on the contrary, to put these last under the hands of the former.
Whereas here, the man who was free was under the feet of the man who
<span id="page_87">p. 87</span> <span id="iii.iv.ix-Page_87"></span>had
been bound. The binder was beseeching him whom he had bound to release
him from his fear. Tell me, was it not thou that didst bind him? Didst
thou not cast him into the inner prison? Didst thou not make his feet
fast in the stocks? Why tremblest thou? Why art thou troubled? Why
weepest thou? Why hast thou drawn thy sword? Never bound I, saith he,
aught like this! I knew not that the prisoners of Christ had power so
mighty as this. What sayest thou? They received power to open Heaven,
and should they not be able to open a prison? They loosed them that were
bound by evil spirits, and was a piece of iron likely to conquer them?
Thou knowest not the men. And therefore also wert thou pardoned. That
prisoner is Paul, whom all the Angels reverence. He is Paul, whose very
handkerchiefs and napkins cast out devils, and chase diseases to flight.
And sure the bond which is of the devil is adamantine, and far more
indissoluble than iron; for this indeed binds the soul, the other only
the body. He therefore that released souls that were bound, shall not he
have power to release his own body? He that could burst asunder the
bonds of evil spirits, shall he not unloose a rivet of iron? He that by
his very garments unloosed those prisoners, and released them from the
spell of devils, shall not he of himself set himself at liberty? For
this was he first bound himself, and then loosed the prisoners, that
thou mightest understand that Christ’s servants in bonds possess a power
far greater than they that are at liberty. Had one who was at liberty
wrought this, then had it not been so marvellous. So then the chain was
not a token of weakness, but rather of a greater power, and thus is the
saint’s might more illustriously displayed, when, even though in bonds,
he overpowers them that are at liberty, when he that is in bonds sets
not only himself at liberty, but them that are in bonds also. Where is
the use of walls? What the advantage of thrusting him into the inner
prison, whereas he opened the outer also? and why too was it done in the
night? and why with an earthquake?

<span id="iii.iv.ix-p12"></span>Oh, bear with me a little, and give me
leave while I refrain from the Apostle’s words, and revel in the
Apostle’s deeds, and banquet on Paul’s chain; grant me still longer to
dwell upon it. I have laid hold on that chain, and no one shall part me
from it. More securely at this moment am I bound by affection, than was
he then in the stocks. This is a bond which no one can loose, for it is
formed of the love of Christ; this neither the Angels, no, nor the
kingdom of Heaven, has power to unloose. We may hear Paul’s own words;
([Rom. 8:38](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#038.md),
[39](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#039.md)<span
id="iii.iv.ix-p12.1"></span>.) “Neither angels, nor principalities, nor
things present, nor things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth,
shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ
Jesus our Lord.”

<span id="iii.iv.ix-p13"></span>Now then, why did the event take place
at midnight? And wherefore too with an earthquake? Hearken, and marvel
at the providential orderings of God. Every one’s bands were loosed, and
the doors were opened. And yet was this done only for the jailor’s sake,
not with a view to display, but with a view to his salvation: for that
the prisoners knew not that they were loosed, is evident from Paul’s
exclamation; for what said he? “He cried with a loud voice, saying, Do
thyself no harm, for we are all here.” ([Acts xvi.
28](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#028)<span id="iii.iv.ix-p13.1"></span>..md)
But never would they all have been within, had they seen the doors
opened, and themselves set at liberty. They who were used to cut through
walls, and to scale roofs and parapets, and to venture on all sorts of
attempts in chains, never would have endured to remain within, with
their bands loosed, and the doors opened, with the jailer himself
asleep; no, but the bond of sleep was to them instead of the bonds of
iron. So that the thing took place and yet no damage ensued from the
miracle to the jailer who was to be saved. And besides this too, they
that are bound are bound most securely in the night, not in the day; and
so accordingly might we behold them bound again with all care and
sleeping: but had these things been done in the day time, there would
have been great stir and tumult.

<span id="iii.iv.ix-p14"></span>Then again, wherefore was the building
shaken? It was to arouse the jailer, to behold what was done, for he
alone was worthy of being saved. And do thou too, behold, I pray, the
exceeding greatness of the grace of Christ, for well were it in the
midst of Paul’s bonds to make mention also of the grace of God, nay
indeed the very bonds themselves are of the gift and grace of God. Some
indeed there are who complain “Why was the jailer saved?” and from those
very circumstances, for which they ought to admire the loving-kindness
of God they find fault with it. Nor is it anything to be wondered at.
Such are those sickly persons, that find fault even with the food that
nourishes them, which they ought to prize, and who affirm that honey is
bitter: and those dimsighted persons who are darkened by the very thing
which ought to enlighten them. Not that these effects arise from the
nature of the objects themselves, but from the weakness of the persons
who are unable to use them properly. What, however, was I saying? When
they ought to be admiring God’s loving-kindness, in that He took a man
who had fallen into the most desperate wickedness, and was making him
better, they find fault: “Why, how was it that he did not take <span
id="page_88">p. 88</span> <span id="iii.iv.ix-Page_88"></span>the thing
to be the work of witchcraft and of sorcery, and confine them the more
closely, and cry out?” Many things conspired to prevent this; first,
that he heard them singing praises to God. And sorcerers never would
have been singing such hymns as those, for he heard them, it is said,
singing praises unto God. Secondly, the fact, that they themselves did
not take flight, but even withheld him from killing himself. Now had
they done it for their own sake, they never would have remained still
within; they would themselves have escaped first of all. Great again was
their kindness also; they withheld the man from killing himself, even
him who had bound them, thus all but saying unto him, “Truly, thou didst
bind us with all safety, and most cruelly, that thou thyself mightest be
loosed from the most cruel of all bonds.” For every one is shackled with
the chains of his own sins; and those bonds are accursed, whereas these
for Christ’s sake are blessed, and worth many an earnest prayer. For
that these bonds can loose those other bonds of sin, he showed to us by
things which are matters of sense. Didst thou behold them released, who
had been bound with iron? Thou shalt see thyself also delivered from
other galling bonds. These bonds, the prisoners’ bonds, not those of
Paul, I mean, are the effect of those other bonds, the bonds of sins.
They who were confined within, were doubly prisoners, and the jailer
himself was a prisoner. They indeed were bound both with iron and with
sins, he with sins only. Them did Paul loose to assure the faith of him,
for the chains which he loosed were visible. And thus too did Christ
Himself; but rather in the inverse order. In that instance, there was a
double palsy. What was it? There was that of the soul by sins, and also
that of the body. What then did the Lord do? “Son,” saith He, “be of
good cheer, thy sins are forgiven.” ([Matt. ix.
3-6](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#003.md)<span
id="iii.iv.ix-p14.1"></span>.) He first loosed the bonds of the real and
true palsy, and then proceeds to the other: for when “certain of the
Scribes said within themselves, This man blasphemeth; Jesus, knowing
their thoughts, said, Wherefore think ye evil in your hearts? For
whether is easier, to say, Thy sins are forgiven, or to say, Arise, and
walk? But, that ye may know that the Son of Man hath power on earth to
forgive sins, (then saith he to the sick of the palsy,) Arise, and take
up thy bed, and go unto thy house.” Having wrought the invisible
miracle, He confirmed it by the visible, the spiritual by the bodily
cure. And why did He do thus? That it might be fulfilled, which is
spoken, ([Luke xix. 22](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#022.md)<span
id="iii.iv.ix-p14.2"></span>.) “Out of thine own mouth will I judge
thee, thou wicked servant.” For what said they? “None can forgive sins,
but God alone.” Of course, therefore, no Angel, nor Archangel, nor any
other created power. This ye have yourselves confessed. And what then
ought to be said? If I shall be shown to have forgiven sins, it is fully
evident that I am God. However, He said it not thus, but what said He?
“But that ye may know that the Son of Man hath power on earth to forgive
sins; then saith He to the sick of the palsy, Arise, and take up thy
bed, and go unto thy house.” ([Matt. ix.
6](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#006)<span id="iii.iv.ix-p14.3"></span>..md)
When therefore, He would say, I work the more difficult miracle, it is
plain that there is no pretext left you, no room for gainsaying about
the easier one. <span id="fr_260"></span>[261](#fn_260.md) Hence it was
that He wrought the invisible miracle first, because there were many
gainsayers; and then He led them from the invisible to the visible
itself.

<span id="iii.iv.ix-p16"></span>Surely then the faith of the jailer was
no light or hasty faith. He saw the prisoners. And he saw nothing, he
heard nothing wrong; he saw that nothing was done by sorcery, for they
were singing hymns unto God. He saw that every thing done proceeded from
overflowing kindness, for they did not avenge themselves against him,
although they had it in their power; for it was in their power to rescue
both themselves and the prisoners, and escape; and if not the prisoners,
at all events themselves; but they did not do this. Thus did they
challenge his reverence, not only by the miracle, but also by their
behavior. For how did Paul cry out? “He cried with a loud voice, saying,
Do thyself no harm, for we are all here.” Thou seest at once his freedom
from vain-glory and arrogance, and his fellow-feeling. He said not, “It
is for us these wonders have been wrought,” but as though he were merely
one of the prisoners, he said, “For we are all here.” And yet, even
though they had not before this loosed themselves, nor had done so by
means of the miracle, still they might have been silent, and have set
all that were bound at liberty. For had they held their peace, and had
they not with their loud crying stayed his hand, he would have thrust
the sword through his throat. Wherefore also Paul cried out, because he
had been cast into the inner ward: as though he had said, “To thine own
injury hast thou done this, that thou hast thrust in so far those that
could deliver thee from the danger.” However they imitated not the
treatment they had received at his hands; though, had he died, all would
have escaped. Thou seest that they chose rather to remain in bonds, than
to suffer him to perish. Hence too might he reason within himself, “Had
they been sorcerers, doubtless <span id="page_89">p. 89</span> <span
id="iii.iv.ix-Page_89"></span>they would have set the others at liberty,
and have released themselves from their bonds:” (for it is likely that
many such had also been imprisoned.) He was the more amazed, in that
having often received sorcerers in charge, he had yet witnessed nothing
done like this. A sorcerer never would have shaken the foundations, so
as to startle the jailer from sleep, and thus render his own escape more
difficult.

<span id="iii.iv.ix-p17"></span>Now, however, let us proceed to look at
the jailor’s faith. “And,” saith the Scripture, “he called for lights
and sprang in, and trembling for fear fell down before Paul and Silas,
and brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?” He
grasped fire and sword, and cried, “Sirs, what must I do to be saved?”
“And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be
saved, thou and thy house.” ([Acts xvi.
29-31](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#029.md)<span
id="iii.iv.ix-p17.1"></span>.) “This is not the act of sorcerers,” he
would say, “to deliver a doctrine like this. No mention any where here
of an evil spirit.” Thou seest how worthy he was to be saved: for when
he beheld the miracle, and was relieved from his terror, he did not
forget what most concerned him, but even in the midst of so great peril,
he was solicitous about that salvation which concerned his soul: and
came before them in such a manner as it was meet to come before
teachers: he fell down at their feet. “And they spake,” it continues,
“the word of the Lord, unto him with all that were in his house. And he
took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes; and was
baptized, he and all his, immediately.” ([Acts
16:32](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#032.md),
[33](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#033.md)<span
id="iii.iv.ix-p17.2"></span>.) Observe the fervency of the man! He did
not delay; he did not say, “Let day come, let us see, let us look about
us;” but with great fervency, he was both himself baptized, and all his
house. Yes, not like most men now-a-days, who suffer both servants and
wives and children to go unbaptized. <span
id="fr_261"></span>[262](#fn_261.md) Be ye, I beseech you, like the jailor.
I say not, in authority, but in purpose; for what is the benefit of
authority, where purpose is weak? The savage one, the inhuman one, who
lived in the practice of unnumbered wrongs and made this his constant
study, has become all at once so humane, so tenderly attentive. “He
washed,” it is said, “their stripes.”

<span id="iii.iv.ix-p19"></span>And mark, on the other hand, the
fervency of Paul also. Bound, scourged, thus he preached the Gospel. Oh,
that blessed chain, with how great travail did it travail that night,
what children did it bring forth! Yea of them too may he say, “Whom I
have begotten in my bonds.” ([Philem.
x](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#010)<span id="iii.iv.ix-p19.1"></span>..md)
Mark thou, how he glories, and will have the children thus begotten, to
be on that account the more illustrious! Mark thou, how transcendant is
the glory of those bonds, in that they give lustre not only to him that
wore them, but also to them who were on that occasion begotten by him.
They have some advantage, who were begotten in Paul’s bonds, I say not
in respect of grace, (for grace is one and the same,) nor in respect of
remission, (for remission is one and the same to all,) but in that they
are thus from the very outset taught to rejoice and to glory in such
things. “The same hour of the night,” it is said, “he took them, and
washed their stripes, and was baptized.”

<span id="iii.iv.ix-p20"></span>And now then behold the fruit. He
straightway recompensed them with his carnal things. “He brought them up
into his house, and set meat before them, and rejoiced greatly with all
his house, having believed in God.” For what was he not ready to do, now
that by the opening of the prison doors, heaven itself was opened to
him? He washed his teacher, he set food before him, and rejoiced. Paul’s
chain entered into the prison, and transformed all things there into a
Church; it drew in its train the body of Christ, it prepared the
spiritual feast, and travailed with that birth, at which Angels rejoice.
And was it without reason then that I said that the prison was more
glorious than Heaven? For it became a source of joy there; yes, if
“there is joy in Heaven over one sinner that repenteth,” ([Luke xv.
7](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#007)<span id="iii.iv.ix-p20.1"></span>..md)
if, “where two or three are gathered together in His Name, there is
Christ in the midst of them;” ([Matt. xviii.
20](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#020)<span id="iii.iv.ix-p20.2"></span>..md)
how much more, where Paul and Silas, and the jailor and all his house
were, and faith so earnest as theirs! Observe the intense earnestness of
their faith.

<span id="iii.iv.ix-p21"></span>But this prison has reminded me of
another prison. And what then is that? It is that where Peter was. Not,
however, that any thing like this took place there. No. He was delivered
to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him and he sang not, he watched
not, but he slept; neither, again, had he been scourged. And yet was the
peril greater, for in the case before us indeed the end was
accomplished, and the prisoners Paul and Silas, had undergone their
punishment; but in his case it was yet to come. So that though there
were no stripes to torture him, yet was there the anticipation of the
future to distress him. And mark too the miracle there. “Behold, an
angel of the Lord,” it is related, “stood by him, and a light shined in
the cell; and he smote Peter on the side, and awoke him, saying, Rise up
quickly. And his chains fell off from his hands.” ([Acts xii.
7](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#007)<span id="iii.iv.ix-p21.1"></span>..md)
In order that he might not imagine the transaction to be the work of the
light alone, he also struck Peter. Now no one saw the light, save
himself only, and he thought it was a vision. So insensible are they
that are asleep to the mercies <span id="page_90">p. 90</span> <span
id="iii.iv.ix-Page_90"></span>of God. “And the angel,” it proceeds,
“said unto him, Gird thyself and bind on thy sandals; and he did so. And
he saith unto him, Cast thy garment about thee, and follow me. And he
went out and followed, and he wist not that it was true which was done
by the angel; but thought he saw a vision. And when they were past the
first and the second ward, they came unto the iron gate, that leadeth
unto the city, which opened to them of his own accord; and they went
out, and passed on through one street; and straightway the angel
departed from him.” ([Acts xii.
8-10](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#008.md)<span
id="iii.iv.ix-p21.2"></span>.) Why was not the same thing done here as
was done in the case of Paul and Silas? Because in that case they were
intending to release them. On that account God willed not that they
should be released in this manner. Whereas in blessed Peter’s case, they
were intending to lead him forth to execution. But what then? Would it
not have been far more marvellous, some one may say, had he been led
forth, and delivered over into the king’s hands, and then had been
snatched away from the very midst of his imminent peril, and sustained
no harm? For thus moreover, neither had the soldiers perished. Great is
the question which has been raised upon this matter. What! did God, it
is said, save His own servant with the punishment of others, with the
destruction of others? Now in the first place, it was not with the
destruction of others; for this did not arise from the ordering of
providence, but arose from the cruelty of the judge. How so? God had so
providentially ordered it, as that not only these men need not perish,
but moreover that even he, the judge, should have been saved, just as in
this case of the jailor. But he did not use the boon aright. “Now as
soon as it was day,” it continues, “there was no small stir among the
soldiers, what was become of Peter.” And what then? Herod makes strict
inquiry into the matter, “and he examined the guards,” it is related,
“and commanded that they should be put to death.” ([Acts xii.
18-19](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#018.md)<span
id="iii.iv.ix-p21.3"></span>.) Now, indeed, had he not examined them,
there might have been some excuse for executing them. Whereas, as it is,
he had them brought before him, he examined them, he found that Peter
had been bound, that the prison had been well secured, that the keepers
were before the doors. No wall had been broken through, no door had been
opened, nor was there any other evidence whatever of false dealing. He
ought upon this to have been awed by the power of God, which had
snatched Peter from the very midst of perils, and to have adored Him who
was able to do such mighty works. But, on the contrary, he ordered those
men off to execution. How then in this case is God the cause? Had He
indeed caused the wall to be broken through, and thus had extricated
Peter, possibly the deed might have been put to the account of their
negligence. But if He so providentially ordered it, as that the matter
should be shown to be the work not of the evil agency of man, but of the
miraculous agency of God, why did Herod act thus? For had Peter intended
to flee, he would have fled as he was, with his chains on. Had he
intended to fly, in his confusion he never would have had so great
forethought as to take even his sandals, but he would have left them.
Whereas, as it is, the object of the Angel’s saying unto him, “Bind on
thy sandals,” was that they might know that he had done the thing not in
the act of flight, but with full leisure. For, bound as he was, and
fixed between the two soldiers, he never would have found sufficient
time to unbind the chains also, and especially as he too, like Paul, was
in the inner ward. Thus then was the punishment of the keepers owing to
the unrighteousness of the judge. For why did not the Jews <span
id="fr_262"></span>[263](#fn_262.md) act in the same way? For now again I
am reminded of yet another prison. The first was that at Rome, next, was
this at Cæsarea, now we come to that at Jerusalem. <span
id="fr_263"></span>[264](#fn_263.md) When then the chief Priests and the
Pharisees heard from those whom they had sent to the prison to bring
Peter out, that “they found no man within,” but both doors “closed,” and
“the keepers standing at the doors,” why was it that they not only did
not put the keepers to death, but, so far from it, “they were much
perplexed concerning them whereunto this would grow.” Now if the Jews,
murderous as they were in their designs against them, yet entertained
not a thought of the kind, much more shouldest not thou, who didst every
thing to please those Jews. For this unrighteous sentence vengeance
quickly overtook Herod.

<span id="iii.iv.ix-p24"></span>But now if any complain of this, then
complain too about those who are killed on the highway, and about the
ten thousand others who are unjustly put to death, and further, of the
infants also that were slaughtered at the time of Christ’s birth; for
Christ also, according to what thou allegest, was the cause of their
deaths. But it was not Christ, but rather the madness and tyranny of
Herod’s father. Dost thou ask, Why then did He not snatch Him out of
Herod’s hands? True, He might have done so, but there would have been
nothing gained by so doing. How many times, at least, did Christ escape
even from the grasp of their hands? <span id="page_91">p. 91</span>
<span id="iii.iv.ix-Page_91"></span>And yet what good did this do to
that unfeeling people? Whereas here there is even much profit arising to
the faithful from what was done. For as there were records made, and the
enemies themselves bore testimony to the facts, the testimony was above
suspicion. As therefore in that instance the mouths of the enemies were
stopped in no other way whatever, but only by the persons who came
acknowledging the facts, so was it also here. For why did the jailor
here do nothing like what Herod did? Nay, and the things which Herod
witnessed were not at all less wonderful than those which this man
witnessed. So far as wonder goes, it is no less wonderful to be assured
that a prisoner came out when the doors were closed, than it is to
behold them set open. Indeed this last might rather have seemed to be
perhaps a vision of the imagination, the other never could, when exactly
and circumstantially reported. So that, had this man been as wicked as
Herod, he would have slain Paul, as Herod did the soldiers; but such he
was not.

<span id="iii.iv.ix-p25"></span>If any one should ask, ‘Why was it that
God permitted the children also to be murdered?’ I should fall,
probably, into a longer discourse, than was originally intended to be
addressed to you.

<span id="iii.iv.ix-p26"></span>At this point, however, let us terminate
our discourse, with many thanks to Paul’s chain, for that it has been
made to us the source of so many blessings, and exhorting you, should ye
have to suffer any thing for Christ’s sake, not only not to repine, but
to rejoice, as the Apostles did, yea, and to glory; as Paul said, “Most
gladly, therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities,” ([2 Cor. xii.
9](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#009)<span id="iii.iv.ix-p26.1"></span>..md)
for because of this it was that he heard also those words, “My grace is
sufficient for thee.” Paul glories in bonds; and dost thou pride thyself
in riches? The Apostles rejoiced that they were counted worthy to be
scourged, and dost thou seek for ease and self-indulgence? On what
ground then, dost thou wish to attain the same end as they, if here on
earth thou art traveling the contrary road from them? “And now,” saith
Paul, “I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things
that shall befall me there; save that the Holy Ghost testifieth unto me
in every city, saying, that bonds and afflictions abide me.” ([Acts xx.
22](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#022)<span id="iii.iv.ix-p26.2"></span>..md)
And why then dost thou set out, if bonds and afflictions abide thee? For
this very reason, saith he, that I may be bound for Christ’s sake, that
I may die for His sake. “For I am ready not to be bound only, but also
to die for the name of the Lord Jesus.” ([Acts xxi.
13](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#013)<span id="iii.iv.ix-p26.3"></span>..md)

<span id="iii.iv.ix-p27"></span><span class="c13"><span
id="iii.iv.ix-p27.1"></span>Moral.</span> Nothing can be more blessed
than that soul. In what does he glory? In bonds, in afflictions, in
chains, in scars; “I bear branded on my body,” saith he, “the marks of
Jesus,” ([Gal. vi. 17](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#017.md)<span
id="iii.iv.ix-p27.2"></span>.) as though they were some great trophy.
And again, “For because of the hope of Israel,” saith he, “I am bound
with this chain.” ([Acts xxviii.
20](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#020)<span id="iii.iv.ix-p27.3"></span>..md)
And again, “For which I am an ambassador in chains.” ([Eph. vi.
20](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#020)<span id="iii.iv.ix-p27.4"></span>..md)
What is this? Art thou not ashamed, art thou not afraid going about the
world as a prisoner? Dost thou not fear lest any one should charge thy
God with weakness? lest any one should on this account refuse to come
near thee and to join the fold? No, saith he, not such are my bonds.
They can shine brightly even in kings’ palaces. “So that my bonds,”
saith he, “became manifest in Christ, throughout the whole prætorian
guard: and most of the brethren in the Lord, being confident through my
bonds, are more abundantly bold to speak the word of God without fear.”
([Phil. 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#013.md),
[14](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#014.md)<span
id="iii.iv.ix-p27.5"></span>.) Behold ye a force in bonds stronger than
the raising of the dead. They beheld me bound, and they are the more
courageous. For where bonds are, there of necessity is something great
also. Where affliction is, there verily is salvation also, there verily
is solace, there verily are great achievements. For when the devil
kicks, then is he, doubtless, hit. <span
id="fr_264"></span>[265](#fn_264.md) When he binds God’s servants, then
most of all does the word gain ground. And mark how this is every where
the case. Paul was imprisoned; and in the prison he did these things,
yea, saith he, by my very bonds themselves. He was imprisoned at Rome,
and brought the more converts to the faith; for not only was he himself
emboldened, but many others also because of him. He was imprisoned at
Jerusalem, and preaching in his bonds he struck the king with amazement,
([Acts xxvi. 28](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#028.md)<span
id="iii.iv.ix-p28.1"></span>.) and made the governor tremble. ([Acts
xxiv. 25](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#025.md)<span
id="iii.iv.ix-p28.2"></span>.) For being afraid, it is related, he let
him go, and he that had bound him was not ashamed to receive instruction
concerning the things to come at the hands of him whom he had bound. In
bonds he sailed, and retrieved the wreck, and bound fast the tempest. It
was when he was in bonds that the monster fastened on him, and fell off
from his hand, having done him no hurt. He was bound at Rome, and
preaching in bonds drew thousands to his cause, holding forward, in the
place of every other, this very argument, I mean his chain.

<span id="iii.iv.ix-p29"></span>It is not however our lot to be bound
now-a-days. And yet there is another chain if we have a mind to wear it.
And what is it? It is to restrain our hand, to be not so forward to
covetousness. With this chain let us bind ourselves. Let the fear of God
be unto us instead of a bond of iron. Let us loose them that are bound
by poverty, by affliction. There is no <span id="page_92">p. 92</span>
<span id="iii.iv.ix-Page_92"></span>comparison between opening the doors
of a prison, and releasing an enthralled soul. There is no comparison
between loosing the bonds of prisoners and “setting at liberty them that
are bruised;” ([Luke iv. 18](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#018.md)<span
id="iii.iv.ix-p29.1"></span>.) this last is far greater than the other;
for the other there is no reward in store, for this last there are ten
thousand rewards.

<span id="iii.iv.ix-p30"></span>Paul’s chain has proved a long one, and
has detained us a length of time. Yea, long indeed it is, and more
beautiful than any cord of gold. A chain this, which draws them that are
bound by it, as it were by a kind of invisible machinery, to Heaven,
and, like a golden cord let down, <span
id="fr_265"></span>[266](#fn_265.md) draws them up to the Heaven of
heavens. And the wonderful thing is this, that, bound, as it is, below,
it draws its captives upwards: and indeed this is not the nature of the
things themselves. But where God orders and disposes, look not for the
nature of things, nor for natural sentence, but for things above nature
and natural sequence.

<span id="iii.iv.ix-p32"></span>Let us learn not to sink under
affliction, nor to repine; for look at this blessed saint. He had been
scourged, and sorely scourged, for it is said, “When they had laid many
stripes upon them.” He had been bound too, and that again sorely, for
the jailor cast him into the inner ward, and with extraordinary
security. And though he was in so many perils, at midnight, when even
the most wakeful are asleep with sleep, another and a stronger bond upon
them, they chanted and sang praise unto the Lord. What can be more
adamantine than these souls? They bethought them how that the holy
Children sang even in fire and furnace. ([Dan. iii.
1-30](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#001.md)<span
id="iii.iv.ix-p32.1"></span>.) Perhaps they thus reasoned with
themselves, “we have as yet suffered nothing like that.”

<span id="iii.iv.ix-p33"></span>But our discourse has done well, in that
it has thus brought us out again to other bonds, and into another
prison. What am I to do? I would fain be silent, but am not able. I have
discovered another prison, far more wonderful and more astonishing than
the former. But, come now, rouse yourselves, as though I were just
commencing my discourse, and attend to me with your minds fresh. I would
fain break off the discourse, but it will not suffer me; for just as a
man in the midst of drinking cannot bear to break off his draught,
whatever any one may promise him; so I too, now I have laid hold of this
glorious cup of the prison of them that were bound for Christ’s sake, I
cannot leave off, I cannot hold my peace. For if Paul in the prison, and
in the night, kept not silence, no, nor under the scourge; shall I, who
am sitting <span id="fr_266"></span>[267](#fn_266.md) here by daylight, and
speaking so much at my ease, shall I hold my peace, when men in bonds,
and under the scourge, and at midnight could not endure to do so? The
holy Children were not silent, no, not in the furnace and in the fire,
and are not we ashamed to hold our peace? Let us look then at this
prison also. Here too, they were bound, but at once and from the very
outset it was evident that they were not about to be burned, but only to
enter as into a prison. For why do ye bind men who are about to be
committed to the flames? They were bound, as Paul was, hand and foot.
They were bound with as great violence as he was. For the jailor thrust
him into the inner prison; and the king commanded the furnace to be
intensely heated. And now let us see the issue. When Paul and Silas
sang, the prison was shaken, and the doors were opened. When the three
Children sang, the bonds both of their feet and hands were loosed. The
prison was opened, and the doors of the furnace were opened: for a dewy
breeze whistled through it.

<span id="iii.iv.ix-p35"></span>But many thoughts crowd around me. I
know not which to utter first, and which second. Wherefore, let no one,
I entreat, require order of me, for the subjects are closely allied.

<span id="iii.iv.ix-p36"></span>They who were bound together with Paul
and Silas were loosed, and yet nevertheless they slept. In the case of
the three Children, instead of that, something else took place. The men
who had cast them in, were themselves burned to death. And then, as I
was fain to tell you, the king beheld them loose, and fell down before
them: he heard them singing their song of praise, and beheld four
walking, and he called them. As Paul, though able to do so, came not
forth, until he who had cast him in, called him, and brought him forth:
so neither did the three Children come forth, until he who had cast them
in commanded them to come forth. What lesson are we taught from this?
Not to be over hasty in courting persecution, nor when in tribulation to
be over eager for deliverance, and on the other hand when they release
us not to continue in it. Further, the jailor, inasmuch as he was able
to enter in where the saints were, fell down at their feet. The king
came but to the door and fell down. He dared not approach into the
prison which he had prepared for them in the fire. And now mark their
words. The one cried, “Sirs, what must I do to be saved?” ([Acts xvi.
30](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#030)<span id="iii.iv.ix-p36.1"></span>..md)
The other, though not indeed with so great humility, yet uttered a voice
no less sweet, “Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, ye servants of the most
high God, come forth, and come hither.” ([Dan. iii.
26](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#026)<span id="iii.iv.ix-p36.2"></span>..md)
<span id="page_93">p. 93</span> <span
id="iii.iv.ix-Page_93"></span>Mighty dignity! “Ye servants of the most
high God, come forth, and come hither.” How are they to come forth, O
king? Thou didst cast them into the fire bound; they have continued this
long time in the fire. Why, had they been made of adamant, had they been
blocks of metal, in singing that entire hymn, must they not have
perished? On this account then they were saved, because they sang
praises to God. The fire reverenced their readiness to suffer and
afterwards it reverenced that wonderful song, and their hymns of praise.
By what title dost thou call them? I said before, “Ye servants of the
most high God.” Yes, to the servants of God, all things are possible;
for if some, who are the servants of men, have, nevertheless, power, and
authority, and the disposal of their concerns, much more have the
servants of God. He called them by the name most delightful to them, he
knew that by this means he flattered them most: for indeed, if it was in
order to continue servants of God, that they entered into the fire,
there could be no sound more delightful to them than this. Had he called
them kings, had he called them lords of the world, yet would he not so
truly have rejoiced them as when he said, “Ye servants of the most high
God.” And why marvel at this? when, in writing to the mighty city, to
her who was mistress of the world, and prided herself upon her high
dignities, Paul set down as equivalent in dignity, nay, as far greater,
yea incomparably greater than consulship, or kingly name, or than the
empire of the world, this title, “Paul, a servant <span
id="fr_267"></span>[268](#fn_267.md) of Jesus Christ.” ([Rom. i.
1](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#001)<span id="iii.iv.ix-p37.1"></span>..md)
“Ye servants of the most high God.” “Yes,” he would say, “if they show
so great zeal as to be bond-servants, doubtless this is the title by
which we shall conciliate them.”

<span id="iii.iv.ix-p38"></span>Again, observe also the piety of the
Children: they showed no indignation, no anger, no gain-saying, but they
came forth. Had they regarded it as an act of vengeance that they had
been thrown into the furnace, they would have been grieved against the
man who had cast them in; as it is, there is nothing of the kind; but,
as though they were going forth from Heaven itself, so went they forth.
And what the Prophet says of the Sun, that “He is as a bridegroom coming
forth out of his chamber,” ([Ps. xix.
5](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#005)<span id="iii.iv.ix-p38.1"></span>..md)
one would not go amiss in saying also of them. But though he goes forth
thus, yet came they forth there more gloriously than he, for he indeed
comes forth to enlighten the world with natural light, they to enlighten
the world in a different way, I mean, spiritually. For because of them
the king straightway issued a decree, containing these words, “It hath
seemed good unto me to show the signs and wonders that the Most High God
hath wrought toward me. How great are His signs! And how mighty are His
wonders!” ([Dan. 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#002.md),
[3](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#003)<span id="iii.iv.ix-p38.2"></span>..md)
So that they went forth, shedding a yet more glorious radiance, beaming
indeed in that region itself, but, what is more than all, capable, by
means of the king’s writings, of being diffused over the world and thus
of dispelling the darkness which every where prevails. “Come forth,”
said he, “and come hither.” He gave no commandment <span
id="fr_268"></span>[269](#fn_268.md) to extinguish the flame, but hereby
most especially honored them, by believing that they were able not only
to walk within it, but even to come out of it while it was still
burning.

<span id="iii.iv.ix-p40"></span>But let us look again, if it seem good
to you, at the words of the jailor, “Sirs, what must I do to be saved?”
What language sweeter than this? This makes the very Angels leap for
joy. To hear this language, even the Only-begotten Son of God Himself
became a servant. This language they who believed at the beginning
addressed to Peter. ([Acts ii. 37](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#037.md)<span
id="iii.iv.ix-p40.1"></span>.) “What shall we do?” And what said he in
answer? “Repent and be baptized.” To have heard this language from the
Jews, gladly would Paul have been cast even in to hell, in his eagerness
for their salvation and obedience. But observe, he commits the whole
matter to them, he wastes no unnecessary pains. Let us however look at
the next point. The king here does not say, What must I do to be saved?
but the teaching is plainer in his case than any language whatever; for
he straightway becomes a preacher, he needs not to be instructed like
the jailor. He proclaims God, and makes confession of His power. “Of a
truth your God is the God of Gods and the Lord of Kings, because He hath
sent His Angel, and hath delivered you.” ([Dan.
2:47](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#047.md), [Dan.
3:28](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#028.md)<span
id="iii.iv.ix-p40.2"></span>.) And what was the sequel? Not one single
jailor, but numbers are instructed by the king’s writings, by the sight
of the facts. For that the king would not have told a falsehood is
evident enough to every one, because he never would have chosen to bear
such testimony to captives, nor to overthrow his own acts; he never
would have chosen to incur the imputation of such utter madness: so that
had not the truth been abundantly manifest, he would not have written in
such terms, and with so many persons present.

<span id="iii.iv.ix-p41"></span>Perceive ye how great is the power of
bonds? How great the force of those praises that are sung in
tribulation? Their heart failed not, they were not cast down, but were
then yet more vigorous, and their courage then yet greater and justly
so.

<span id="iii.iv.ix-p42"></span>While we are considering these things
one <span id="page_94">p. 94</span> <span
id="iii.iv.ix-Page_94"></span>question yet remains for us: Why was it
that in the prison on the one hand, the prisoners were loosed, whilst in
the furnace the executioners were burnt to death: for that indeed should
have been the king’s fate, because neither were they who bound them, nor
they who cast them into the furnace, guilty of so great sin as the man
who commanded this should be done. Why then did they perish? On this
point there is not any very great need of minute examination; for they
were wicked men. And therefore this was providentially ordered, that the
power of the fire might be shown, and the miracle might be made more
signal; for if it thus devoured them that were without, how did it show
them unscathed that were within it? it was that the power of God might
be made manifest. And let no one wonder that I have put the king on a
level with the jailor, for he did the same thing; the one was in no wise
more noble than the other, and they both had their reward.

<span id="iii.iv.ix-p43"></span>But, as I said, the righteous, when they
are in tribulations, are then especially more energetic, and when they
are in bonds: for to suffer any thing for Christ’s sake is the sweetest
of all consolation.

<span id="iii.iv.ix-p44"></span>Will ye that I remind you of yet another
prison? It seems necessary to go on from this chain to another prison
still. And which will ye? Shall it be that of Jeremiah, or of Joseph, or
of John? Thanks to Paul’s chain; how many prisons has it opened to our
discourse? Will ye have that of John? He also was once bound for
Christ’s sake, and for the law of God. What then? Was he idle when he
was in prison? Was it not from thence he sent, by his disciples, and
said, “Art Thou He that cometh, or look we for another?” ([Matt.
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#002.md),
[3](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#003)<span id="iii.iv.ix-p44.1"></span>..md)
Even when there, then, it seems he taught, for surely he did not
disregard his duty. But again, did not Jeremiah prophesy concerning the
king of Babylon, and fulfil his work even there in prison? And what of
Joseph? Was he not in prison thirteen years? What then? Not even there
did he forget his virtue. I have yet to mention the bonds of one and
therewith will close my discourse. Our Master Himself was bound, He who
loosed the world from sins. Those hands were bound, those hands that
wrought ten thousand good deeds. For, “they bound Him,” it saith, “and
led Him away to Caiaphas;” ([Matt.
27:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#002.md), [John
18:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#024.md)<span
id="iii.iv.ix-p44.2"></span>.) yes, He was bound who had wrought so many
marvellous works.

<span id="iii.iv.ix-p45"></span>Reflecting on these things, let us never
repine; but whether we be in bonds, let us rejoice; or whether we be not
in bonds, let us be as though we were bound together with Him. See how
great a blessing are bonds! Knowing all these things, let us send up our
thanksgiving for all things to God, through Christ Jesus our Lord with
whom to the Father, together with the Holy Ghost, be glory, might, and
honor, now and forever and ever. Amen.
