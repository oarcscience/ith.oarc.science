id="v.v.ii-p2.3"></span></span>

<span id="v.v.ii-p3"></span>“For this cause left I thee in Crete, that
thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain
elders in every city as I had appointed thee: If any be blameless, the
husband of one wife, having faithful children, not accused of riot, or
unruly.”

<span id="v.v.ii-p4"></span><span class="c13"><span
id="v.v.ii-p4.1"></span>The</span> whole life of men in ancient times
was one of action and contention; ours on the contrary is a life of
indolence. They knew that they were brought into the world for this
purpose, that they might labor according to the will of Him who brought
them into it; but we, as if we had been placed here but to eat and
drink, and lead a life of pleasure, we pay no regard to spiritual
things. I speak not only of the Apostles, but of those that followed
them. You see them accordingly traversing all places, and pursuing this
as their only business, living altogether as in a foreign land, as those
who had no city upon earth. Hear therefore what the blessed Apostle
saith,

<span id="v.v.ii-p5"></span>“For this cause left I thee in Crete.”

<span id="v.v.ii-p6"></span>As if the whole world had been one house,
they divided it among themselves, administering its affairs everywhere,
each taking care of his several portion of it.

<span id="v.v.ii-p7"></span>“For this cause left I thee in Crete, that
thou shouldest set in order the things that are \[R.V. were\] wanting.”

<span id="v.v.ii-p8"></span>He does not command this in an imperious
manner; “that thou shouldest set in order,” he says. Here we see a soul
free from all envy, seeking everywhere the advantage of his disciples,
not curiously solicitous, whether the good was done by himself or by
another. For where there was a case of danger and great difficulty, he
in his own person set it in order. But those things which were rather
attended with honor and praise he committed to his disciple, as the
ordination of Bishops, and such other things as required some farther
arrangement, <span id="fr_1453"></span>[1454](#fn_1453.md) or, so to speak,
to be brought to greater perfection. What sayest thou? does he farther
set in order thy work? and dost thou not think it a disgrace bringing
shame upon thee? By no means; for I look only to the common good, and
whether it be done by me, or by another, it makes no difference to me.
Thus it becomes him to be affected who presides in the Church, not to
seek his own honor, but the common good.

<span id="v.v.ii-p10"></span>“And ordain elders in every city,” here he
is speaking of Bishops, as we have before said, <span
id="fr_1454"></span>[1455](#fn_1454.md) “as I had appointed thee. If any is
blameless.” “In every city,” he says, for he did not wish the whole
island to be intrusted to one, but that each should have his own charge
and care, for thus he would have less labor himself, and those under his
rule would receive greater attention, if the Teacher had not to go about
to <span id="fr_1455"></span>[1456](#fn_1455.md) the presidency of many
Churches, but was left to be occupied with one only, and to bring that
into order.

<span id="v.v.ii-p13"></span>[Tit.
1.6](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#006.md)<span id="v.v.ii-p13.1"></span>.
“If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children,
not accused of riot, or unruly.”

<span id="v.v.ii-p14"></span>Why does he bring forward such an one? To
stop the mouths of those heretics, who condemned marriage, showing that
it is not an unholy thing in itself, but so far honorable, that a
married man might ascend the holy throne; and at the same reproving the
wanton, and not permitting their admission into this high office who
contracted a second marriage. For he who retains no kind regard for her
who is departed, how shall he be a good president? and what accusation
would he not incur? For you all know, that though it is not forbidden by
the laws to enter into a second marriage, yet it is a thing liable to
many ill constructions. Wishing therefore a ruler to give no handle for
reproach to those under his rule, he on this account says, “If any be
blameless,” <span id="fr_1456"></span>[1457](#fn_1456.md) that is, if his
life be free from reproach, if he has given occasion to no one to assail
his character. Hear what Christ says, “If the light that is in thee be
darkness, how great is that darkness!” ([Matt. vi.
23](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#023)<span id="v.v.ii-p15.1"></span>..md)

<span id="v.v.ii-p16"></span>“Having faithful children, not accused of
riot, or unruly.”

<span id="v.v.ii-p17"></span>We should observe what care he bestows upon
children. For he who cannot be the instructor of his own children, how
should he be the Teacher of others? If he cannot keep in order those
whom he has had with him from the beginning, whom he has brought up, and
over whom he had power both by the laws, and by nature, how will he be
able to benefit those without? For if the incompetency <span
id="fr_1457"></span>[1458](#fn_1457.md) of the father had not been great,
he would not have allowed those to become bad whom from the first he had
under his power. For it is not possible, indeed it is not, that one
should turn out ill who is brought up with much care, and <span
id="page_525">p. 525</span> <span id="v.v.ii-Page_525"></span>has
received great attention. Sins are not so prevalent by nature, as to
overcome so much previous care. But if, occupied in the pursuit of
wealth, he has made his children a secondary concern, and not bestowed
much care upon them, even so he is unworthy. For if when nature
prompted, he was so void of affection or so senseless, that he thought
more of his wealth than of his children, how should he be raised to the
Episcopal throne, and so great rule? For if he was unable to restrain
them it is a great proof of his weakness; and if he was unconcerned, his
want of affection is much to be blamed. He then that neglects his own
children, how shall he take care of other men’s? And he has not only
said, “not riotous,” but not even “accused of riot.” There must not be
an ill report, or such an opinion of them.

<span id="v.v.ii-p19"></span>[Tit.
1.7](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#007.md)<span id="v.v.ii-p19.1"></span>.
“For a Bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not self-willed,
not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker.”

<span id="v.v.ii-p20"></span>For a ruler without, as he rules by law and
compulsion, perhaps does not consult the wishes of those under his rule.
But he who ought to rule men with their own consent, and who will be
thankful for his rule, if he so conduct himself as to do everything of
his own will, and share counsels with no one, makes his presidency
tyrannical rather than popular. For he must be “blameless, as the
steward of God, not self-willed, not soon angry.” For how shall he
instruct others to rule that passion, who has not taught himself? For
power leads on to many temptations, it makes a man more harsh and
difficult to please, even him that was very mild, surrounding him with
so many occasions of anger. If he have not previously practiced himself
in this virtue, he will grow harsh, and will injure and destroy much
that is under his rule.

<span id="v.v.ii-p21"></span>“Not given to wine, <span
id="fr_1458"></span>[1459](#fn_1458.md) no striker.” Here he is speaking of
the insolent man. For he should do all things by admonition or rebuke,
and not by insolence. What necessity, tell me, for insult? He ought to
terrify, to alarm, to penetrate the soul with the threat of hell. But he
that is insulted becomes more impudent, and rather despises him that
insults him. Nothing produces contempt more than insult; it disgraces
the insolent person, and prevents his being respected, as he ought to
be. Their discourse ought to be delivered with much caution. In
reproving sins they should bear in mind the future judgment, but keep
clear of all insolence. Yet if any prevent them from doing their duty,
they must prosecute the matter with all authority. “Not a striker,” he
says. The teacher is the physician of souls. But the physician does not
strike, but heals and restores him that has stricken him. “Not given to
filthy lucre.”

<span id="v.v.ii-p23"></span>[Tit.
1.8](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#008.md)<span id="v.v.ii-p23.1"></span>.
“But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy,
temperate.”

<span id="v.v.ii-p24"></span>[Tit.
1.9](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#009.md)<span id="v.v.ii-p24.1"></span>.
“Holding fast the faithful word as he has been taught.”

<span id="v.v.ii-p25"></span>You see what intensity of virtue he
required. “Not given to filthy lucre,” that is, showing great contempt
for money. “A lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just,
holy”; he means, giving away all his substance to them that need.
“Temperate”; he speaks not here of one who fasts, but of one who
commands his passions, his tongue, his hands, his eyes. For this is
temperance, to be drawn aside by no passion.

<span id="v.v.ii-p26"></span>“Holding fast the faithful word as he hath
been taught.” By “faithful” is here meant “true,” or that which was
delivered through faith, not requiring reasonings, or questionings.

<span id="v.v.ii-p27"></span>“Holding fast,” that is, having care of it,
making it his business. What then, if he be ignorant of the learning
that is without? For this cause, he says, “the faithful word, according
to teaching.” <span id="fr_1459"></span>[1460](#fn_1459.md)

<span id="v.v.ii-p29"></span>“That he may be able both to exhort, and to
convince the gainsayers.”

<span id="v.v.ii-p30"></span>So that there is need not of pomp of words,
but of strong minds, of skill in the Scriptures and of powerful
thoughts. Do you not see that Paul put to flight the whole world, that
he was more powerful than Plato and all the rest? But it was by
miracles, you say. Not by miracles only, for if you peruse the Acts of
the Apostles, you will find him often prevailing by his teaching
previously to his miracles.

<span id="v.v.ii-p31"></span>“That he may be able by sound doctrine to
exhort,” that is, to retain his own people, and to overthrow the
adversaries. “And to convince the gainsayers.” For if this is not done,
all is lost. He who knows not how to combat the adversaries, and to
“bring every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ,” and to
beat down reasonings, he who knows not what he ought to teach with
regard to right doctrine, far from him be the Teacher’s throne. For the
other qualities may be found in those under his rule, such as to be
“blameless, to have his children in subjection, to be hospitable, just,
holy.” But that which characterizes the Teacher is this, to be able to
instruct in the word, to which no regard is now paid.

<span id="v.v.ii-p32"></span>[Tit.
1.10](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#010.md)<span id="v.v.ii-p32.1"></span>.
“For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, especially
they of the circumcision;”

<span id="v.v.ii-p33"></span>[Tit.
1.11](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#011.md)<span id="v.v.ii-p33.1"></span>.
“Whose mouths must be stopped.”

<span id="v.v.ii-p34"></span>Seest thou how he shows that they are such?
From their not wishing to be ruled, but to rule. For he has glanced at
this. When therefore thou canst not persuade them, do not give them
charges, but stop their mouths, for the benefit of <span
id="page_526">p. 526</span> <span id="v.v.ii-Page_526"></span>others.
But of what advantage will this be, if they will not obey, or are
unruly? Why then should he stop their mouths? In order that others may
be benefited by it.

<span id="v.v.ii-p35"></span>“Who subvert whole houses, teaching things
which they ought not for filthy lucre’s sake.”

<span id="v.v.ii-p36"></span>For if he has undertaken the office of a
Teacher, and is not able to combat these enemies, and to stop their
mouths who are so shameless, he will become in each case the cause of
their destination who perish. And if some one has thus advised, “Seek
not to be a judge, unless thou canst take away iniquity”
([Ecclesiasticus 7.6](../../../bib/apo/sir007.htm#006.md)<span
id="v.v.ii-p36.1"></span>.); much more may we say here, “Seek not to be
a Teacher, if thou art unequal to the dignity of the office; but though
dragged to it, decline it.” Dost thou see that the love of power, <span
id="fr_1460"></span>[1461](#fn_1460.md) the love of filthy lucre, is the
cause of these evils? “Teaching things which they ought not,” he says,
“for filthy lucre’s sake.”

<span id="v.v.ii-p38"></span><span class="c13"><span
id="v.v.ii-p38.1"></span>Moral</span>. For there is nothing which is not
spoiled by these passions. But as when violent winds, falling on a calm
sea, turn it up from its foundation, and mingle the sand with the waves,
so these passions assailing the soul turn all upside down, and dim the
clearness of the mental sight, but especially does the mad desire of
glory. For a contempt for money any one may easily attain, but to
despise the honor that proceeds from the multitude, requires a great
effort, a philosophic temper, a certain angelic soul that reaches to the
very summit of heaven. For there is no passion so tyrannical, so
universally prevalent, in a greater or less degree indeed, but still
everywhere. How then shall we subdue it, if not wholly, yet in some
little part? By looking up to heaven, by setting God before our eyes, by
entertaining thoughts superior to earthly things. Imagine, when thou
desirest glory, that thou hast already attained it, and mark the end,
and thou wilt find it to be nothing. Consider with what loss it is
attended, of how many and how great blessings it will deprive thee. For
thou wilt undergo the toils and danger, yet be deprived of the fruits
and rewards of them. Consider that the majority are bad, and despise
their opinion. In the case of each individual, consider what the man is,
and thou wilt see how ridiculous a thing is glory, that it is rather to
be called shame.

<span id="v.v.ii-p39"></span>And after this, lift up thy thoughts to the
theater <span id="fr_1461"></span>[1462](#fn_1461.md) above. When in doing
any good thou considerest that it ought to be displayed to men, and thou
seekest for some spectators of the action, and art in travail to be
seen, reflect that God beholds thee, and all that desire will be
extinguished. Retire from the earth, and look to that theater that is in
Heaven. If men should praise thee, yet hereafter they will blame thee,
will envy thee, will assail thy character; or if they do not, yet their
praise will not benefit thee. It is not so with God. He delights in
praising our virtuous deeds. Hast thou spoken well, and obtained
applause? What hast thou gained? For if those who applauded thee were
benefited, changed in their minds, become better men, and had desisted
from their evil deeds, then mightest thou indeed rejoice, not at the
praises bestowed, but at the wonderful change for the better. But if
they continue their praises, and loud plaudits, but gain no good by what
they applaud, thou oughtest rather to grieve: for these things turn to
their judgment and condemnation. <span
id="fr_1462"></span>[1463](#fn_1462.md) But thou obtainest glory for thy
piety. If thou art truly pious, and conscious of no guilt, thou
shouldest rejoice, not because thou are reputed pious, but because thou
art so. But if, without being so, thou desirest the good opinion of the
multitude, consider that they will not be thy judges at the last day,
but He who knoweth perfectly the things that are hid. And if while
conscious of guilt, thou art supposed by all to be pure, instead of
rejoicing, thou shouldest grieve and mourn bitterly, keeping constantly
in view that Day, in which all things will be revealed, in which the
hidden things of darkness will be brought to light.

<span id="v.v.ii-p42"></span>Dost thou enjoy honor? reject it, knowing
that it renders thee a debtor. Does no one honor thee? thou oughtest to
rejoice at it. For God will not lay <span
id="fr_1463"></span>[1464](#fn_1463.md) to thy charge this, among other
things, that thou hast enjoyed honor. Seest thou not that God upbraids
Israel with this among other things, by his prophet, “I took of your
sons for Prophets, and of your young men for sanctification”? ([Amos ii.
11](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#011.md)<span id="v.v.ii-p43.2"></span>,
Sept.) Thou wilt therefore gain this advantage at least, that thou wilt
not aggravate thy punishment. For he who is not honored in the present
life, who is despised, and held in no consideration, but is insulted and
scorned, gains this at least, if nothing else, that he has not to answer
for being honored by his fellow-servants. <span
id="fr_1464"></span>[1465](#fn_1464.md) And on many other accounts he
gains <span id="fr_1465"></span>[1466](#fn_1465.md) by it. He is brought
down and humbled, nor if he would, can he be high-minded, if <span
id="fr_1466"></span>[1467](#fn_1466.md) he takes the more heed to himself.
But he, who enjoys more honor, besides being responsible for great
debts, is lifted up into arrogance and vainglory, and becomes the slave
of men; and as this tyranny increases, he is compelled to do many things
which he would not.

<span id="v.v.ii-p47"></span>Knowing therefore that it is better to want
<span id="page_527">p. 527</span> <span
id="v.v.ii-Page_527"></span>glory, than to possess it, let us not seek
for honors, but evade them when they are offered, let us cast them from
us, let us extinguish that desire. This we have said at once to the
rulers of the church, and to those under their rule. For a soul desirous
of honor, and of being glorified, shall not see the kingdom of heaven.
This is not my own saying. I speak not my own words, but those of the
Spirit of God. He shall not see it, though he practice virtue. For he
saith, “They have their reward.” ([Matt. vi.
5](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#005)<span id="v.v.ii-p47.1"></span>..md) He
then, who has no reward to receive, how shall he see the kingdom of
heaven? I forbid thee not to desire glory, but I would wish it to be the
true glory, that which proceeds from God. “Whose praise,” it is said,
“is not of men, but of God.” ([Rom. ii.
29](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#029)<span id="v.v.ii-p47.2"></span>..md)
Let us be pious in secret, not cumbered with parade, and show, and
hypocrisy. Let us cast away the sheep’s clothing, and rather let us
become sheep. Nothing is more worthless than the glory of men. Should
thou see a company of little children, mere sucklings, wouldest thou
desire glory from them? <span id="fr_1467"></span>[1468](#fn_1467.md) Be
thus affected towards all men with respect to glory.

<span id="v.v.ii-p49"></span>It is for this reason called vainglory.
Dost thou see the masks worn by stage-players? how beautiful and
splendid they are, fashioned to the extreme height of elegance. Canst
thou show me any such real countenance? By no means. What then? didst
thou ever fall in love with them? No. Wherefore? Because they are empty,
imitating beauty, but not being really beautiful. Thus human glory is
empty, and an imitation of glory: it is not true glory. That beauty only
which is natural, which is within, is lasting: that which is put on
externally often conceals deformity, conceals it from men until the
evening. But when the theater breaks up, and the masks are taken off,
each appears what he really is.

<span id="v.v.ii-p50"></span>Let us therefore pursue truth, and not be
as if we were on the stage and acting a part. For of what advantage is
it, tell me, to be gazed at by a multitude? It is vainglory, and nothing
else. For return to thy house, and solitude, and immediately all is
gone. Thou hast gone to the market-place, thou hast turned upon thee the
eyes of all present. What hast thou gained? Nothing. It vanished, and
passed away like dissolving smoke. Do we then love things thus
unsubstantial? How unreasonable is this! what madness! To one thing only
let us look, to the never seek the praise of men; but if it falls to us,
we shall despise, deride, and reject it. We shall be affected as those
who desire gold, but receive clay. Let not any one praise thee, for it
profits nothing; and if he blame thee, it harms thee not. But with God
praise and blame are attended with real gain and loss, whilst all is
vain that proceeds from men. And herein we are made like unto God, that
He needs not glory from men. “I receive not,” said Christ, “honor from
men.” ([John v. 41](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#041.md)<span
id="v.v.ii-p50.1"></span>.) Is this then a light thing, tell me? When
thou art unwilling to despise glory, say, “By despising it, I shall
resemble God,” and immediately thou wilt despise it. But it is
impossible that the slave of glory should not be a slave to all, more
servile than slaves in reality. For we do not impose upon our slaves
such tasks, as glory exacts from her captives. Base and shameful are the
things she makes them say, and do, <span
id="fr_1468"></span>[1469](#fn_1468.md) and suffer, and when she sees them
obedient, she is the more urgent in her commands.

<span id="v.v.ii-p52"></span>Let us fly then, I entreat you, let us fly
from this slavery. But how shall we be able? If we think seriously <span
id="fr_1469"></span>[1470](#fn_1469.md) of what is in this world, if we
observe that things present are a dream, a shadow, and nothing better;
we shall easily overcome this desire, and neither in little nor in great
things shall be led captive by it. But if in little things we do not
despise it, we shall easily be overcome by it in the most important. Let
us therefore remove far from us the sources of it, and these are, folly,
and meanness of mind, so that, if we assume a lofty spirit, we shall be
able to look beyond honor from the multitude, and to extend our views to
heaven, and obtain the good things there. Of which God grant that we may
all be partakers, by the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus
Christ, with whom, &c.
