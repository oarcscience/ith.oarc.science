id="iv.v.iv-p1.1"></span>Homily IV.</span>

<span id="iv.v.iv-p2"></span><span id="iv.v.iv-p2.1"></span><span
class="c1"><span id="iv.v.iv-p2.2"></span>[1 Thessalonians iii.
5-8](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#005.md)<span
id="iv.v.iv-p2.3"></span></span>

<span id="iv.v.iv-p3"></span>“For this cause I also, when I could no
longer forbear, sent that I might know your faith, lest by any means the
tempter had tempted you, and our labor should be in vain. But when
Timothy came even now unto us from you, and brought us glad tidings of
your faith and love, and that ye have good remembrance of us always,
longing to see us, even as we also to see you; for this cause, brethren,
we were comforted over you in all our distress and affliction through
your faith: for now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord.”

<span id="iv.v.iv-p4"></span><span class="c13"><span
id="iv.v.iv-p4.1"></span>A question</span> lies before us to-day, which
is much disputed, and which is gathered from many sources. But what is
this question? “For this cause,” he says, “when I could no longer
forbear, I sent Timothy that I might know your faith.” What sayest thou?
He, who knew so many things, who heard unutterable words, who ascended
even to the third heaven, doth not he know, even when he is in Athens?
And yet the distance is not great, nor has he been long parted from
them. For he says, “Being bereaved of you for a short season.” He does
not know the affairs of the Thessalonians, but is compelled to send
Timothy to know their faith, “lest,” he says, “the tempter had tempted
you, and our labors should be in vain.”

<span id="iv.v.iv-p5"></span>What then is one to say? That the Saints
knew not all things. And this one might learn from many instances, both
of the early ones, and of those who came after them, as Elisha knew not
concerning the woman ([2 Kings iv.
27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#027)<span id="iv.v.iv-p5.1"></span>..md);
as Elijah said to God, “I only am left, and they seek my life.”
Wherefore he heard from God, “I have left me seven thousand men.” ([1
Kings 10:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#010.md),
[18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1010.htm#018)<span id="iv.v.iv-p5.2"></span>..md)
Samuel again, when he was sent to anoint David; “The Lord said to him,
Look not on his countenance, nor on the height of his stature; because I
have rejected him: for God seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on
the outward appearance, but God looketh on the heart.” ([1 Sam. xvi.
7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#007)<span id="iv.v.iv-p5.3"></span>..md)

<span id="iv.v.iv-p6"></span>And this comes to pass out of great care on
God’s part. How, and in what way? For the sake both of the Saints
themselves, and of those who believe in them. For as He permits that
there should be persecutions, so He permits that they should also be
ignorant of many things, that they may be kept humble. On this account
also Paul said, “There was given to me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger
of Satan to buffet me, that I should not be exalted over much.” ([2 Cor.
xii. 7](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#007.md)<span
id="iv.v.iv-p6.1"></span>.) And again, lest others also should have
great imaginations concerning them. For if they thought they were gods
from their miracles, much more if they had continued always knowing all
things. And this again he also says: “Lest any man should account of me
above that which he seeth me to be, or heareth from me.” ([2 Cor. xii.
6](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#006)<span id="iv.v.iv-p6.2"></span>..md) And
again hear Peter, when he healed the lame man, saying, “Why fasten ye
your eyes on us, as though by our own power or godliness we had made him
to walk.” ([Acts iii. 12](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#012.md)<span
id="iv.v.iv-p6.3"></span>.) And if even when they were saying and doing
these things, and from these few and small miracles, evil imaginations
were thus engendered, much more would they have been from great ones.

<span id="iv.v.iv-p7"></span>But for another reason too these things
were allowed. For that no one might be able to say it was as being other
than men that they performed those excellent actions, and so all should
become supine, he shows their infirmity, that from their folly he might
cut off every pretext of shamelessness. For this reason he is ignorant,
for this reason also, after having purposed, he frequently does not
come, that they might perceive there were many things he knew not. Great
advantage then came of this. For if there were some yet saying, “This
man is that power of God which is called Great” ([Acts viii.
10](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#010)<span id="iv.v.iv-p7.1"></span>..md),
and some, that it is this person, or that; unless these things had been
so, what would they not have thought?

<span id="iv.v.iv-p8"></span>But here, however, there seems to be a
censure on them. But quite otherwise, it even shows their admirable
conduct, and proves the excess of their temptations. How? Attend. For if
thou first sayest “that we are appointed thereunto,” and “let no man be
moved,” why again dost thou send Timothy, fearing that something might
happen which thou wouldest not wish. This indeed he does from his great
love. For those who love suspect even what is safe, from their exceeding
warmth. But this is caused by their great temptations. For I said indeed
that we are appointed thereunto, but the excess of the temptations
alarmed me. Wherefore he has not said, I send him as condemning you, but
“when I could no longer forbear,” which is rather an expression of love.

<span id="iv.v.iv-p9"></span>What means, “Lest by any means the tempter
had tempted you”? Dost thou see that to be shaken in afflictions
proceeds from the devil, and from his seduction? For when he cannot
<span id="page_340">p. 340</span> <span
id="iv.v.iv-Page_340"></span>shake us ourselves, he takes another
way, <span id="fr_978"></span>[979](#fn_978.md) and shakes the weaker sort
through our means, which argues exceeding infirmity, and such as admits
of no excuse; as he did in the case of Job, having stirred up his wife,
“Speak some word against the Lord,” she says, “and die.” ([Job ii.
9](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#009.md)<span id="iv.v.iv-p10.1"></span>,
Sept.) See how he tempted her.

<span id="iv.v.iv-p11"></span>But wherefore has he not said, “shaken,”
but “tempted”? Because, he says, I only suspected so much, as that you
had been tempted. For he does not call his temptation a wavering. For he
who admits his attack is shaken. Strange! how great is the affection of
Paul! He did not regard afflictions, nor plots against him. For I think
that he then remained there, as Luke says, that “he abode in Greece
three months, when <span id="fr_979"></span>[980](#fn_979.md) the Jews laid
a plot against him.” ([Acts xx. 3](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#003.md)<span
id="iv.v.iv-p12.1"></span>.)

<span id="iv.v.iv-p13"></span>His concern therefore was not for his own
dangers, but for his disciples. Seest thou how he surpassed every
natural parent? For we in our afflictions and dangers lose the
remembrance of all. But he so feared and trembled for his children, that
he sent to them Timothy, whom alone he had for his consolation, his
companion and fellow-laborer, and him too in the very midst of dangers.

<span id="iv.v.iv-p14"></span>“And our labor,” he says, “should be in
vain.” Wherefore! for even if they were turned aside, it was not through
thy fault, not through thy negligence. But nevertheless, though this
were the case, I think, from my great love of the brethren, that my
labor had been rendered vain.

<span id="iv.v.iv-p15"></span>“Lest by any means the tempter had tempted
you.” But he tempts, not knowing whether he shall overthrow. Does he
then, even though he knows not, yet assail us, and do we, who know that
we shall completely overcome him, not watch? But that he does attack us,
though he knows not, he showed in the case of Job. For that evil demon
said to God, “Hast Thou not made a hedge about his things within, and
his things without? Take away his goods, and surely he will bless <span
id="fr_980"></span>[981](#fn_980.md) Thee to Thy face.” ([Job
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#010.md),
[11](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#011.md)<span id="iv.v.iv-p16.4"></span>,
Sept.) He makes trial; if he sees anything weak, he makes an attack, if
strong, he desists. “And our labor,” he says, “be in vain.” Let us all
hear, how Paul labored. He does not say work, but “labor”; he does not
say, and you be lost, but “our labor.” <span
id="fr_981"></span>[982](#fn_981.md) So that even if anything had happened,
it would be happening with some reason. But that it did not happen was a
great wonder. These things indeed we expected, he says, but the contrary
happened. For not only did we receive from you no addition to our
affliction but even consolation.

<span id="iv.v.iv-p18"></span>“But when Timothy came even now unto us,
and brought us glad tidings of your faith and love.” “Brought us glad
tidings,” he says. Do you see the excessive joy of Paul? he does not
say, brought us word, but “brought us glad tidings.” So great a good did
he think their steadfastness and love. For it was necessary, the one
remaining firm, that the other also must be steadfast. And he rejoiced
in their love, because it was a sign of their faith. “And that ye have,”
he says, “good remembrance of us always, longing to see us, even as we
also to see you.” That is, with praises. Not when we were present, nor
when we were working miracles, but even now, when we are far off, and
are scourged, and are suffering numberless evils, “ye have good
remembrance of us.” Hear how disciples are admired, who have good
remembrance of their teachers, how they are called blessed. Let us
imitate these. For we benefit ourselves, not those who are loved by us.
“Longing to see us,” he says, “as we also to see you.” And this too
cheered them; for to him who loves, to perceive that the beloved person
knows that he is beloved, is a great comfort and consolation.

<span id="iv.v.iv-p19"></span>“For this cause, brethren, we were
comforted over you in all our distress and affliction through your
faith. For now we live if ye stand fast in the Lord.” What is comparable
to Paul, who thought the salvation of his neighbors was his own, being
so affected towards all, as really towards members? Who now would be
able to break forth into such speech? Or rather, who will ever be able
to have such a thought? He did not require them to be thankful to him
for the trials which he suffered for them, but he was thankful to them
that they were not moved on account of his trials. As if he had said,
that to you rather than to us was injury done by those trials; you were
tempted rather than we, you who suffered nothing, rather than we who
suffered. Because, he says, Timothy brought us these good tidings, we
feel nothing of our sorrows, but were comforted in all our affliction;
not in this affliction only. For nothing besides can touch a good
teacher, as long as the affairs of his disciples go on to his mind.
Through you, he says, we were comforted; you confirmed us. And yet the
reverse was the case. For <span id="page_341">p. 341</span> <span
id="iv.v.iv-Page_341"></span>that when suffering they did not yield, but
stood manfully, was sufficient to confirm the disciples. But he reverses
the whole matter, and turns the encomium over to them. You have anointed
us, he says, you have caused us to breathe again; you have not suffered
us to feel our trials. And he has not said, we breathe again, nor we are
comforted, but what? “Now we live,” showing that he thinks nothing is
either trial or death, but their stumbling, whereas their advancement
was even life. How else could any one have set forth either the sorrow
for the weakness of one’s disciples, or the joy? He has not said we
rejoice, but “we live,” the life to come.

<span id="iv.v.iv-p20"></span>So that without this we do not even think
it life to live. So ought teachers to be affected, so disciples; and
there will be nothing at any time amiss. <span
id="fr_982"></span>[983](#fn_982.md) Then further softening the expression,
see what he says,

<span id="iv.v.iv-p22"></span>[1 Thess.
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#009.md),
[10](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#010.md)<span id="iv.v.iv-p22.1"></span>.
“For what thanksgiving can we render again unto God for you, for all the
joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our God; night and day
praying exceedingly that we may see your face, and may perfect that
which is lacking in your faith?”

<span id="iv.v.iv-p23"></span>Not only, he says, are ye the causes of
life to us, but also of much joy, and so much that we cannot worthily
give thanks to God. Your <span id="fr_983"></span>[984](#fn_983.md) good
behavior, he says, we consider to be the gift of God. Such kindnesses
have you shown to us, that we think it to be of God; yea, rather, and it
is of God. For such a disposition of mind comes not of a human soul or
carefulness.

<span id="iv.v.iv-p25"></span>“Night and day,” he says, “praying
exceedingly.” This too is a sign of joy. For as any husbandman, hearing
concerning his land that has been tilled by himself, that it is burdened
with ears of grain, longs with his own eyes to see so pleasant a sight,
so Paul to see Macedonia. “Praying exceedingly.” Observe the excess;
“that we may see your face, and may perfect that which is lacking in
your faith.”

<span id="iv.v.iv-p26"></span>Here there is a great question. For if now
thou livest, because they stand fast, and Timothy brought thee “glad
tidings of their faith and love,” and thou art full of so much joy as
not to be able worthily to give thanks to God, how sayest thou here that
there are deficiencies in their faith? Were those then the words of
flattery? By no means, far be it. For previously he testified that they
endured many conflicts, and were no worse affected than the Churches in
Judæa. What then is it? They had not enjoyed the full benefit of his
teaching, nor learned all that it behoved them to learn. And this he
shows toward the end. Perhaps there had been questionings among them
concerning the Resurrection, and there were many who troubled them, not
by temptations, nor by dangers, but by acting the part of teachers. This
is what he says is lacking in their faith, and for this reason, he has
so explained himself, and has not said, that you should be confirmed,
where indeed he feared concerning the faith itself, “I have sent,” he
says, “Timothy ‘to confirm you,’” but here, “to perfect that which is
lacking,” which is rather a matter of teaching than of confirming. As
also he says elsewhere, “that ye may be perfected unto every good work.”
(From [1 Cor. 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#010.md), [2 Tim.
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#017)<span id="iv.v.iv-p26.1"></span>..md)
Now the perfected thing is one in which there is some little deficiency:
for it is that which is brought to perfection.

<span id="iv.v.iv-p27"></span>[1 Thess.
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#011.md),
[12](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#012.md)<span id="iv.v.iv-p27.1"></span>.
“Now may our God and Father Himself, and our Lord Jesus Christ direct
our way unto you: and the Lord make you to increase and abound in love
one toward another, and toward all men, even as we also do toward you.”

<span id="iv.v.iv-p28"></span>This is a proof of excessive love, that he
not only prays for them by himself, but even in his Epistles inserts his
prayer. This argues a fervent soul, and one truly not to be restrained.
This is a proof of the prayers made there also, and at the same time
also an excuse, as showing that it was not voluntarily, nor from
indolence, that they <span id="fr_984"></span>[985](#fn_984.md) did not go
to them. As if he had said, May God Himself cut short the temptations
that everywhere distract us, so that we may come directly to you. “And
the Lord make you to increase and abound.” Do you see the unrestrainable
madness of love that is shown by his words? “Make you to increase and
abound,” <span id="fr_985"></span>[986](#fn_985.md) instead of cause you to
grow. As if one should say, that with a kind of superabundance he
desires to be loved by them. “Even as we do also toward you,” he says.
Our part is already done, we pray that yours may be done. Do you see how
he wishes love to be extended, not only toward one another, but
everywhere? For this truly is the nature of godly love, that it embraces
all. If you love indeed such an one, but do not love such an one, it is
human love. But such is not ours. “Even as we do also toward you.”

<span id="iv.v.iv-p31"></span>[1 Thess.
3.13](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#013.md)<span id="iv.v.iv-p31.1"></span>.
“To the end He may establish your hearts unblamable in holiness before
our God and Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all His
saints.”

<span id="iv.v.iv-p32"></span>He shows that love produces advantage to
themselves, not to those who are loved. I wish, he says, that this love
may abound, that there may be no blemish. He does not say to stablish
<span id="page_342">p. 342</span> <span
id="iv.v.iv-Page_342"></span>you, but your hearts. “For out of the heart
come forth evil thoughts.” ([Matt. xv.
19](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#019)<span id="iv.v.iv-p32.1"></span>..md)
For it is possible, without doing anything, to be a bad man; as for
example, to have envy, unbelief, deceit, to rejoice at evils, not to be
loving, to hold perverted doctrines, all these things are of the heart;
and to be pure of these things is holiness. For indeed chastity is
properly by preëminence called holiness, since fornication and adultery
is also uncleanness. <span id="fr_986"></span>[987](#fn_986.md) But
universally all sin is uncleanness, and every virtue is purity. For,
“Blessed,” it is said, “are the pure in heart.” ([Matt. v.
8](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#008)<span id="iv.v.iv-p33.1"></span>..md) By
“the pure” He means those who are in every way pure.

<span id="iv.v.iv-p34"></span>For other things also know how to pollute
the soul, and no less. For that wickedness defiles the soul, hear the
prophet, saying, “O Jerusalem, wash thine heart from wickedness.” ([Jer.
iv. 14](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#014.md)<span
id="iv.v.iv-p34.1"></span>.) And again, “Wash you, make you clean, put
away the wickednesses from your souls.” ([Isa. i.
16](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#016.md)<span id="iv.v.iv-p34.2"></span>,
Sept.) He did not say “fornications,” so that not only fornication, but
other things also defile the soul.

<span id="iv.v.iv-p35"></span>“To establish your hearts,” he says,
“unblamable in holiness before our God and Father, at the coming of our
Lord Jesus Christ with all His saints.” Therefore Christ will then be a
Judge, but not before Him (only), but also before the Father we shall
stand to be judged. Or does he mean this, to be unblamable before God,
as he always says, “in the sight of God,” for this is sincere virtue—not
in the sight of men?

<span id="iv.v.iv-p36"></span>It is love then that makes them
unblamable. For it does make men really unblamable. And once when I was
discoursing of this to a certain one, and saying, that love makes men
unblamable, and that love to our neighbor does not suffer any entrance
of transgression, and in my discourse going over, and pursuing all the
rest—some one of my acquaintance interposing himself said, What then of
fornication, is it not possible both to love, and to commit fornication?
And it is indeed from love that this springs. Covetousness indeed, and
adultery, and envy, and hostile designs, and everything of this sort
can, from love of one’s neighbor, be stopped; but how fornication? he
said. I therefore told him, that even this can love stop. For if a man
should love a woman that commits fornication, he will endeavor both to
draw her off from other men, and not himself also to add to her sin. So
that to commit fornication with a woman is the part of one exceedingly
hating her with whom he commits the fornication, but one who truly loved
her would withdraw her from that abominable practice. And there is not,
there is not any sin, which the power of love, like fire, cannot
consume. For it is easier for a vile faggot to resist a great pile of
fire, than for the nature of sin to resist the power of love.

<span id="iv.v.iv-p37"></span>This then let us plant in our own souls,
that we may stand with all the Saints. For they all pleased God by their
love to their neighbor. Whence was Abel slain, and did not slay? From
his vehement love to his brother, he could not even admit such a
thought. Whence was the destructive pest of envy received by Cain? For I
will no longer call him the brother of Abel! Because the foundations of
love had not been firmly fixed in him. Whence did the sons of Noah
obtain a good report? was it not because they vehemently loved their
father, and did not endure to see his exposure? And whence was the other
cursed? was it not from not loving him? And whence did Abraham obtain a
good report? was it not from love in doing what he did concerning his
nephew? what he did as to his supplication for the Sodomites? For
strongly, strongly, were the Saints affected with love and with
sympathy.

<span id="iv.v.iv-p38"></span>For consider, I pray; Paul, he that was
bold in the face of fire, hard as adamant, firm and unshaken, on every
side compact, riveted in the fear of God, and inflexible; for, “who
(said he) shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation,
or anguish, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or
sword”? ([Rom. viii. 35](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#035.md)<span
id="iv.v.iv-p38.1"></span>.) he that was bold in the face of all these
things, and of earth and sea, he that laughed to scorn the adamantine
gates of death, <span id="fr_987"></span>[988](#fn_987.md) whom nothing
ever withstood,—he, when he saw the tears of some whom he loved, was so
broken and crushed,—the adamantine man,—that he did not even conceal his
feelings, but said straightway, “What do ye, weeping and breaking my
heart?” ([Acts xxi. 13](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#013.md)<span
id="iv.v.iv-p39.3"></span>.) What sayest thou, tell me? Had a tear the
power to crush that soul of adamant? Yea, he says, for I hold out
against all things except love. This prevails over me, and subdues me.
This is the mind of God. An abyss of water <span
id="fr_988"></span>[989](#fn_988.md) did not crush him, and a few tears
crushed him. “What do ye, weeping and crushing my heart?” For great is
the force of love. Dost thou not see him again weeping? Why weepest
thou? Tell me. “By the space of three years,” he says, “I ceased not to
admonish every one night and day with tears.” ([Acts xx.
31](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#031)<span id="iv.v.iv-p40.2"></span>..md)
From his great love he feared, lest some plague should be introduced
among them. And again, “For out of much affliction and anguish of heart
I wrote unto you with many tears.” ([2 Cor. ii.
4](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#004)<span id="iv.v.iv-p40.3"></span>..md)

<span id="iv.v.iv-p41"></span>And what did Joseph? tell me, that firm
one, who stood up against so great a tyranny, who appears so noble
against so great a flame of love, <span id="page_343">p. 343</span>
<span id="iv.v.iv-Page_343"></span>who so out-battled and overcame the
madness of his mistress. For what was there not then to charm him? A
beautiful person, the pride of rank, the costliness of garments, the
fragrance of perfumes, (for all these things know how to soften the
soul,) words more soft than all the rest! For ye know that she who
loves, and so vehemently, nothing so humble but she will bring herself
to say it, taking upon her the attitude of a supplicant. For so broken
was this woman, though wearing gold, and being of royal dignity, that
she threw herself at the knees perhaps of the captive boy, and perhaps
even intreated him weeping and clasping his knees, and had recourse to
this not once, and a second time, but oftentimes. Then he might see her
eye shining most brilliantly. For it is probable that she not simply but
with excessive nicety would set off her beauty; as wishing by many nets
to catch the lamb of Christ. Add here I pray also many magic charms. Yet
nevertheless this inflexible, this firm man, of rocky hardness, when he
saw his brothers who had bartered him away, who had thrown him into a
pit, who had sold him, who had even wished to murder him, who were the
causes both of the prison and the honor, when he heard from them how
they had worked upon their father, (for, we said, it says, that one was
devoured by a wild beast \[[Gen.
37:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#020.md), Gen. 64:28<span
id="iv.v.iv-p41.1"></span>,\]) he was broken, softened, crushed, “And he
wept,” it says, and not being able to bear his feelings, he went in, and
composed himself ([Gen. xliii. 30](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#030.md)<span
id="iv.v.iv-p41.2"></span>.), that is, wiped away his tears.

<span id="iv.v.iv-p42"></span>What is this? dost thou weep, O Joseph?
and yet the present circumstances are deserving not of tears, but of
anger, and wrath, and indignation, and great revenge and retribution.
Thou hast thine enemies in thy hands, those fratricides; thou canst
satiate thy wrath. And yet neither would this be injustice. For thou
dost not thyself begin the unjust acts, but defendest thyself against
those who have done the wrong. For look not to thy dignity. This was not
of their contrivance, but of God, who shed His favor upon thee. Why dost
thou weep? But he would have said, far be it that I, who in all things
have obtained a good report, should by this remembrance of wrongs
overturn them all. It is truly a season for tears. I am not more brutish
than beasts. They pour out a libation to nature, whatever harm they
suffer. I weep, he says, that they ever treated me thus.

<span id="iv.v.iv-p43"></span>This man let us also imitate. Let us mourn
and weep for those who have injured us. Let us not be angry with them.
For truly they are worthy of tears, for the punishment and condemnation
to which they make themselves liable. I know, how you now weep, how you
rejoice, both admiring Paul, and amazed at Joseph, and pronouncing them
blessed. But if any one has an enemy, let him now take him into
recollection, let him bring him to his mind, that whilst his heart is
yet warm with the remembrance of the Saints, he may be enabled to
dissolve the stubbornness of wrath, and to soften what is harsh and
callous. I know, that after your departure hence, after that I have
ceased speaking, if anything of warmth and fervor should remain, it will
not be so great, as it now is whilst you are hearing me. If therefore
any one, if any one has become cold, let him dissolve the frost. For the
remembrance of injuries is truly frost and ice. But let us invoke the
Sun of Righteousness, let us entreat Him to send His beams upon us, and
there will no longer be thick ice, but water to drink.

<span id="iv.v.iv-p44"></span>If the fire of the Sun of Righteousness
has touched our souls, it will leave nothing frozen, nothing hard,
nothing burning, <span id="fr_989"></span>[990](#fn_989.md) nothing
unfruitful. It will bring out all things ripe, all things sweet, all
things abounding with much pleasure. If we love one another, that beam
also will come. Allow me, I beseech you, to say these things with
earnestness. Cause me to hear, that by these words we have produced some
effect; that some one has gone and thrown both his arms about his enemy,
has embraced him, has twined himself around him, has warmly kissed him,
has wept. And though the other be a wild beast, a stone, or whatever he
be, he will be made gentle by such affectionate kindness. For on what
account is he thine enemy? Hath he insulted thee? yet he has not injured
thee at all. But dost thou for the sake of money suffer thy brother to
be at enmity with thee? Do not so, I beseech you. Let us do away all. It
is our season. Let us use it to good purpose. Let us cut asunder the
cords of our sins. Before we go away to judgment, let us not ourselves
judge one another. “Let not the sun” (it is said) “go down upon your
wrath.” ([Eph. iv. 26](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#026.md)<span
id="iv.v.iv-p48.2"></span>.) Let no one put it off. These puttings off
produce delays. If you have deferred it to-day, you blush the more, and
if you add to-morrow, the shame is greater, and if a third day, yet
worse. Let us not then put ourselves to shame, but let us forgive, that
we may be forgiven. And if we be forgiven, we shall obtain all
blessings, through Jesus Christ our Lord, with whom, &c.

id="iv.v.iv-p9.1"></span>

<span id="iv.v.iv-p10"></span> ἑτέρως might be taken thus, “when he
cannot shake us otherwise,” the other being a last resource *against
us*.

<span id="fn_979"></span>[340:980](1130075.htm#fr_979.md) <span
id="iv.v.iv-p11.1"></span>

<span id="iv.v.iv-p12"></span> The Greek will read thus, but will hardly
bear the construction. \[The plot was at the end of the three months,
and caused him to change his course.—J.A.B.\]

<span id="fn_980"></span>[340:981](1130075.htm#fr_980.md) <span
id="iv.v.iv-p15.1"></span>

<span id="iv.v.iv-p16"></span> \[The Hebrew word denotes both bless and
curse (perhaps both derived from the idea of supplicating God). The
Septuagint translates “bless” in [Job
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#011.md), [Job
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#005.md)<span id="iv.v.iv-p16.1"></span>,
and evades by paraphrases in [Job
1.5](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#005.md)<span id="iv.v.iv-p16.2"></span>,
“devised evil against God,” and [Job
2.9](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#009.md)<span id="iv.v.iv-p16.3"></span>,
“say some word unto the Lord.”—J.A.B.\]

<span id="fn_981"></span>[340:982](1130075.htm#fr_981.md) <span
id="iv.v.iv-p16.5"></span>

<span id="iv.v.iv-p17"></span> \[Three Greek words are employed. The
Apostle’s term would be better translated “toil”; and so Chrys. remarks,
“He does not say work, but toil.” The same distinction is to be observed
in [Rev. xiv. 13](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#013.md)<span
id="iv.v.iv-p17.1"></span>, “in that they shall rest from their toils,
for their works follow with them.” The verb here employed by Chrys.,
“how Paul labored,” signifies weary or suffering labor.—J.A.B.\]

<span id="fn_982"></span>[341:983](1130075.htm#fr_982.md) <span
id="iv.v.iv-p20.1"></span>

<span id="iv.v.iv-p21"></span> ἄτοπον.

id="iv.v.iv-p23.1"></span>

<span id="iv.v.iv-p24"></span> So Musculus, who may have had <span
class="c16"><span id="iv.v.iv-p24.1"></span>ms</span>. authority. All
Greek copies except Catena read “our,” which requires κατόρθωμα to be
rendered “achievement” in a less proper sense. \[Three <span
class="c16"><span id="iv.v.iv-p24.2"></span>mss</span>. give “our,” and
although two of them form a group that abounds in wrong alterations, yet
the present reading is probably correct.—J.A.B.\]

<span id="fn_984"></span>[341:985](1130075.htm#fr_984.md) <span
id="iv.v.iv-p28.1"></span>

<span id="iv.v.iv-p29"></span> St. Paul and Silvanus.

<span id="fn_985"></span>[341:986](1130075.htm#fr_985.md) <span
id="iv.v.iv-p29.1"></span>

<span id="iv.v.iv-p30"></span> The words are strong, “make you to exceed
and overflow.”

<span id="fn_986"></span>[342:987](1130075.htm#fr_986.md) <span
id="iv.v.iv-p32.2"></span>

<span id="iv.v.iv-p33"></span> This is legally opposed to holiness.

<span id="fn_987"></span>[342:988](1130075.htm#fr_987.md) <span
id="iv.v.iv-p38.2"></span>

<span id="iv.v.iv-p39"></span> \[Field’s <span class="c16"><span
id="iv.v.iv-p39.1"></span>mss</span>. all give “death”; the previous
editions all had “Hades,” a natural alteration. Cases are not very rare
in which the editions were without known <span class="c16"><span
id="iv.v.iv-p39.2"></span>ms</span>. support.—J.A.B.\]

<span id="fn_988"></span>[342:989](1130075.htm#fr_988.md) <span
id="iv.v.iv-p39.4"></span>

<span id="iv.v.iv-p40"></span> Perhaps alluding to [2 Cor. xi.
25](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#025.md)<span id="iv.v.iv-p40.1"></span>.

<span id="fn_989"></span>[343:990](1130075.htm#fr_989.md) <span
id="iv.v.iv-p44.1"></span>

<span id="iv.v.iv-p45"></span> The translator suggests Milton’s sense:—

<span id="iv.v.iv-p46"></span>“The parching air

<span id="iv.v.iv-p47"></span>Burns frore, and cold performs th’ effects
of fire.”

<span id="iv.v.iv-p48"></span>The extreme harshness of some fruits
without the sun may be meant. In Hom. xvi. on St. Matt. Ben. p. 215 A,
τὰ καυστικὰ is used for “combustibles,” but there is a various reading,
ὑπαναπτικὰ in one <span class="c16"><span
id="iv.v.iv-p48.1"></span>ms</span>.; see Ed. Field, p. 229.
