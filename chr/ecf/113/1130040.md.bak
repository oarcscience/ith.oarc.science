<span id="iv.ii-p2"></span>————————————

<span id="iv.ii-p3"></span><span class="c13"><span
id="iv.ii-p3.1"></span>The</span> present Volume completes the
commentaries of St. Chrysostom on the shorter Epistles of St. Paul. It
consists entirely of Homilies delivered at Constantinople, and one may
perhaps remark some indications of a more matured and severe character
than in earlier works. He refers several times to his responsibility as
presiding in the Church, and sometimes threatens discipline as in that
capacity, and from this it is that the date of the Homilies is chiefly
to be gathered. The end of Hom. ix. on the Philippians, is sufficient
for those Homilies. The close of Hom. iii. on Colossians, is still more
express for them. Hom. viii. on 1 Thessalonians, and Hom. iv. on 2
Thessalonians, are to the like purpose.

<span id="iv.ii-p4"></span>Hom. viii. on 1 Thessalonians, seems also to
be that which is referred to in Hom. iii. on Ep. to Philemon, as it
contains a promise to discuss at some future time the subject there
taken up.

<span id="iv.ii-p5"></span>[Philip. ii.
6](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#006.md)<span id="iv.ii-p5.1"></span>, and
[Col. i. 15](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015.md)<span
id="iv.ii-p5.2"></span>, &c. give rise to doctrinal discussions. The
readiness in argument, which they suppose in hearers, is greater than
one would expect. Hom. v. on Colossians goes farther into the system of
typical interpretation than is usual with St. Chrysostom; though the
system is in fact acknowledged by him frequently, as in the passage on
marriage, which closes the Homilies on the Colossians, and which, though
scarcely admissible in modern taste, is one of great value, and of a
saintly purity. The close of Hom. iv. on Colossians is most instructive
with regard to the use of the Historical Books of the Old Testament, and
Hom. ix. points out one great use of the Psalms, for moral impression,
and at the same time draws the necessary distinction between that and
the higher aim of Hymns. In these Homilies he is particularly severe on
luxury and display, by his attacks on which he is known to have incurred
the displeasure of the Empress Eudoxia, and much persecution from her.

<span id="iv.ii-p6"></span>A passage on the Holy Sacraments at the end
of Hom. vi. on Colossians, one on Prayers for the departed in Hom. iii.
on Philippians, and one in which he urges persons at enmity to immediate
reconciliation, Hom. vi. on 1 Thessalonians, as well as that in Hom.
iii. in Colossians, on unworthiness of Ministers, and several hints that
occur about the order of Divine service, are well worthy of remark.

<span id="iv.ii-p7"></span>Savile’s text, with some comparison of
others, was used for the Homilies on the Philippians, and that of the
new Paris Edition, with Savile always at hand, for the rest. Collations
of one <span class="c16"><span id="iv.ii-p7.1"></span>ms.</span> in
British Museum (Burney 48 here marked B \[called C by Field\]) were also
in hand, but those of <span class="c16"><span
id="iv.ii-p7.2"></span>mss.</span> at Venice and Florence came too late
for part of the work. The want of them is not however very material. The
Bodleian <span class="c16"><span id="iv.ii-p7.3"></span>ms.</span>
referred to, as well as the Catena published by Dr. Cramer, contain only
extracts. It is hoped that the Homilies on 2 Cor. will have the benefit
of a well-adjusted text before the Translation is published, as they are
preparing for publication by Mr. Field, whom the Editor has to thank for
infor<span id="page_176">p. 176</span> <span
id="iv.ii-Page_176"></span>mation on some particulars, as well as for
the benefit of having his accurate edition of the Homilies on St.
Matthew to refer to.

<span id="iv.ii-p8"></span>For the Translation of the Homilies on the
Philippians, the Editors are indebted to the Rev. W. C. <span
class="c16"><span id="iv.ii-p8.1"></span>Cotton</span>, M.A. of Ch. Ch.
Chaplain to the Bishop of New Zealand; for that of the Homilies on the
Colossians, to the Rev. J. <span class="c16"><span
id="iv.ii-p8.2"></span>Ashworth</span>, M.A. Fellow of Brasenose
College; and for the rest of the volume, to the Rev. <span
class="c16"><span id="iv.ii-p8.3"></span>James</span> <span
class="c16"><span id="iv.ii-p8.4"></span>Tweed</span>, M.A. of Corpus
Christi College, Cambridge, the Translator of the Homilies on the
Pastoral Epistles of St. Paul. The Index to the two former is by the
Rev. F. <span class="c16"><span id="iv.ii-p8.5"></span>Bowles</span>,
M.A. of Exeter College, and to the latter by the Editor, which is
noticed in order that the reader may find the less difficulty from any
difference in the heads under which similar matter may be placed, as the
two were made simultaneously to save time.

<span id="iv.ii-p9"></span>A few points on which the Editor was not
informed until the sheets were printed are noticed in the Addenda and
Corrigenda. \[In the Amer. ed. these are inserted in their proper
places. For the text followed in Amer. ed., see Preface at the beginning
of the volume.\]
