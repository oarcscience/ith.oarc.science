id="iii.iv.xxv-p1.1"></span>Homily XXIV.</span>

<span id="iii.iv.xxv-p2"></span><span id="iii.iv.xxv-p2.1"></span><span
class="c1"><span id="iii.iv.xxv-p2.2"></span>[Ephesians vi.
14-17](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#014.md)<span
id="iii.iv.xxv-p2.3"></span></span>

<span id="iii.iv.xxv-p3"></span>“Stand therefore, having girded your
loins with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness; and
having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace;
withal taking up the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to
quench all the fiery darts of the evil one. And take the helmet of
salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.”

<span id="iii.iv.xxv-p4"></span>“<span class="c16"><span
id="iii.iv.xxv-p4.1"></span>Having</span> girded your loins,” saith he,
“with truth.” What can be the meaning of this? I have stated in the
preceding discourse, that he ought to be lightly accoutered, in order
that there should be no impediment whatever to his running.

<span id="iii.iv.xxv-p5"></span>“And having on,” he continues, “the
breastplate of righteousness.” As the breastplate is impenetrable, so
also is righteousness, and by righteousness here he means a life of
universal virtue. <span id="fr_488"></span>[489](#fn_488.md) Such a life no
one shall ever be able to overthrow; it is true, many wound him, but no
one cuts through him, no, not the devil himself. It is as though one
were to say, “having righteous deeds fixed in the breast”; of these it
is that Christ saith, “Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after
righteousness; for they shall be filled.” ([Matt. v.
6](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#006)<span id="iii.iv.xxv-p6.3"></span>..md)
Thus is he firm and strong like a breastplate. Such a man will never be
put out of temper.

<span id="iii.iv.xxv-p7"></span>“And having shod your feet with the
preparation of the gospel of peace.” It is more uncertain in what sense
this was said. What then is its meaning? They are noble greaves,
doubtless, with which he invests us. Either then he means this, that we
should be prepared for the gospel, and should make use of our feet for
this, and should prepare and make ready its way before it; <span
id="fr_489"></span>[490](#fn_489.md) or if not this, at least that we
ourselves should be prepared for our departure. “The preparation,” then,
“of the gospel of peace,” is nothing else than a most virtuous life;
according to what the Prophet saith. “Thou wilt prepare their heart,
thou wilt cause thine ear to hear.” ([Ps. x.
17](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#017)<span id="iii.iv.xxv-p8.3"></span>..md)
“Of the gospel,” he says, “of peace,” and with reason; for inasmuch as
he had made mention of warfare and fighting, he shows us that this
conflict with the evil spirits we must needs have: for the gospel is
“the gospel of peace”; this war which we have against them, puts an end
to another war, that, namely, which is between us and God; if we are at
war with the devil, we are at peace with God. Fear not therefore,
beloved; it is a “gospel,” that is, a word of good news; already is the
victory won.

<span id="iii.iv.xxv-p9"></span>“Withal taking up the shield of faith.”

<span id="iii.iv.xxv-p10"></span>By “faith” in this place, he means, not
knowledge, (for that he never would have ranged last,) but that gift by
which miracles are wrought. <span id="fr_490"></span>[491](#fn_490.md) And
with reason does he term this “‘faith’ a shield”; for as the shield is
put before the whole body, as if it were a sort of rampart, just so is
this faith; for all things yield to it.

<span id="iii.iv.xxv-p12"></span>“Wherewith ye shall be able,” saith he,
“to quench all the fiery darts of the evil one.”

<span id="iii.iv.xxv-p13"></span>For this shield nothing shall be able
to resist; for hearken to what Christ saith to His disciples, “If ye
have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain,
Remove hence to yonder place, and it shall remove.” ([Matt. xvii.
20](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#020.md)<span
id="iii.iv.xxv-p13.1"></span>.) But how are we to have this faith? When
we have rightly performed all those duties.

<span id="iii.iv.xxv-p14"></span>“By the darts of the evil one,” he
means, both temptations, and vile desires; and “fiery,” he says, for
such is the character of these desires. Yet if faith can command the
evil spirits, much more can it also the passions of the soul.

<span id="iii.iv.xxv-p15"></span>“And take the helmet,” he continues,
“of salvation,” that is, of your salvation. For he is casing them in
armor.

<span id="iii.iv.xxv-p16"></span>“And the sword of the Spirit, which is
the word of God.” He either means the Spirit, or else, “the spiritual
sword”: for by this <span id="fr_491"></span>[492](#fn_491.md) all things
are severed, by this all things are cleft asunder, by this we cut off
even the serpent’s head.

<span id="iii.iv.xxv-p18"></span>[Eph.
6.18-20](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#018.md)<span
id="iii.iv.xxv-p18.1"></span>. “With all prayer and supplication,” saith
he, “praying at all seasons in the Spirit, and watching thereunto in all
perseverance and supplication for all the saints; and on my behalf that
utterance may be given unto me, in opening my mouth to make known with
boldness the mystery of the gospel, for which <span id="page_168">p.
168</span> <span id="iii.iv.xxv-Page_168"></span>I am an ambassador in
chains, that in it I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.”

<span id="iii.iv.xxv-p19"></span>As the word of God has power to do all
things, so also has he who has the spiritual gift. “For the word of
God,” saith he, “is living, and active and sharper than any two-edged
sword.” ([Heb. iv. 12](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#012.md)<span
id="iii.iv.xxv-p19.1"></span>.) Now mark the wisdom of this blessed
Apostle. He hath armed them with all security. What then is necessary
after that? To call upon the King, that He may stretch forth His hand.
“With all prayer, and supplication, praying at all seasons in the
Spirit”; for it is possible “to pray” not “in the Spirit,” when one
“uses vain repetitions” ([Matt. vi.
7](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#007.md)<span
id="iii.iv.xxv-p19.2"></span>.); “and watching thereunto,” he adds, that
is, keeping sober; for such ought the armed warrior, he that stands at
the King’s side, to be; wakeful and temperate:—“in all perseverance and
supplication for all the saints; and on my behalf that utterance may be
given unto me in opening my mouth.” What sayest thou, blessed Paul? Hast
thou, then, need of thy disciples? And well does he say, “in opening my
mouth.” He did not then study what he used to say, but according to what
Christ said, “When they deliver you up, be not anxious how or what ye
shall speak: for it shall be given you in that hour what ye shall speak”
([Matt. x. 19](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#019.md)<span
id="iii.iv.xxv-p19.3"></span>.): so truly did he do everything by faith,
everything by grace. “With boldness,” he proceeds, “to make known the
mystery of the Gospel”; that is, that I may answer for myself in its
defense, as I ought. And art thou bound in thy chain, and still needest
the aid of others? Yea, saith he, for so was Peter also bound in his
chain, and yet nevertheless “was prayer made earnestly for him.” ([Acts
xii. 5](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#005.md)<span
id="iii.iv.xxv-p19.4"></span>.) “For which I am an ambassador in chains,
that in it I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak”; that is, that I may
answer with confidence, with courage, with great prudence.

<span id="iii.iv.xxv-p20"></span>[Eph.
6.21](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#021.md)<span
id="iii.iv.xxv-p20.1"></span>. “But that ye also <span
id="fr_492"></span>[493](#fn_492.md) may know my affairs, how I do,
Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall
make known to you all things.”

<span id="iii.iv.xxv-p22"></span>As soon as he had mentioned his chains,
he leaves something for Tychicus also to relate to them of his own
accord. For whatever topics there were of doctrine and of exhortation,
all these he explained by his letter: but what were matters of bare
recital, these he entrusted to the bearer of the letter. “That ye may
know my affairs,” that is, may be informed of them. This manifests both
the love which he entertained towards them, and their love towards him.

<span id="iii.iv.xxv-p23"></span>[Eph.
6.22](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#022.md)<span
id="iii.iv.xxv-p23.1"></span>. “Whom I have sent unto you,” saith he,
“for this very purpose, that ye may know our state, and that he may
comfort your hearts.”

<span id="iii.iv.xxv-p24"></span>This language he employs, not without a
purpose, but in consequence of what he had been saying previously;
“having girded your loins, having on the breastplate,” &c., which are a
token of a constant and unceasing advance; for hear what the Prophet
saith, “Let it be unto him as the raiment wherewith he covereth himself,
and for the girdle wherewith he is girded continually” ([Ps. cix.
19](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#019.md)<span
id="iii.iv.xxv-p24.1"></span>.); and the Prophet Isaiah again saith,
that God hath “put on righteousness as a breastplate” ([Isa. lix.
17](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#017.md)<span
id="iii.iv.xxv-p24.2"></span>.); by these expressions instructing us
that these are things which we must have, not for a short time only, but
continually, inasmuch as there is continual need of warfare. “For it is
said the righteous are bold as a lion.” ([Prov. xxviii.
1](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#001)<span id="iii.iv.xxv-p24.3"></span>..md)
For he that is armed with such a breastplate, it cannot be that he
should fear the array that is against him, but he will leap into the
midst of the enemy. And again Isaiah saith, “How beautiful are the feet
of him that bringeth good tidings.” ([Isa. lii.
7](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#007)<span id="iii.iv.xxv-p24.4"></span>..md)
Who would not run, who would not serve in such a cause; to publish the
good tidings of peace, peace between God and man, peace, where men have
toiled not, but where God hath wrought all?

<span id="iii.iv.xxv-p25"></span>But what is the “preparation of the
Gospel”? <span id="fr_493"></span>[494](#fn_493.md) Let us hearken to what
John saith, “Make ye ready the way of the Lord, make His paths
straight.” ([Matt. iii. 3](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#003.md)<span
id="iii.iv.xxv-p26.1"></span>.) But again there is need also of another
“preparation” after baptism, so that we may do nothing unworthy of
“peace.” And then, since the feet are usually a token of the way of
life, hence he is constantly exhorting in this language, “Look,
therefore, carefully how ye walk.” ([Eph. v.
15](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#015.md)<span
id="iii.iv.xxv-p26.2"></span>.) On this account, he would say, let us
exhibit a practice and example worthy of the Gospel; that is, make our
life and conduct pure. The good tidings of peace have been proclaimed to
you, give to these good tidings a ready way; since if ye again become
enemies, there is no more “preparation of peace.” Be ready, be not
backward to embrace this peace. As ye were ready and disposed for peace
and faith, so also continue. The shield is that which first receives the
assaults of the adversary, and preserves the armor uninjured. So long
then as faith be right and the life be right, the armor remains
uninjured.

<span id="iii.iv.xxv-p27"></span>He discourses, however, much concerning
faith, but most especially in writing to the Hebrews, as he does also
concerning hope. Believe, saith he, in the good things to come, and none
of this armor shall be injured. In dangers, in toils, by holding out thy
hope and thy faith to protect thee, thou wilt preserve thy armor
uninjured. “He that cometh to God <span id="page_169">p. 169</span>
<span id="iii.iv.xxv-Page_169"></span>must believe that He is, and that
He is a rewarder of them that seek after Him.” ([Heb. xi.
6](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#006)<span id="iii.iv.xxv-p27.1"></span>..md)
Faith is a shield; but wherever there are quibbles, and reasonings, and
scrutinizings, then is it no longer a shield, but it impedes us. Let
this our faith be such as shall cover and screen the whole frame. Let it
not then be scanty, so as to leave the feet or any other part exposed,
but let the shield be commensurate with the whole body.

<span id="iii.iv.xxv-p28"></span>“Fiery <span
id="fr_494"></span>[495](#fn_494.md) darts.” For many doubtful reasonings
there are, which set the soul, as it were, on fire, many difficulties,
many perplexities, but all of them faith sets entirely at rest; many
things does the devil dart in, to inflame our soul and bring us into
uncertainty; as, for example, when some persons say, “Is there then a
resurrection?” “Is there a judgment?” “Is there a retribution?” “But is
there faith?” the apostle would say, “thou shalt with it quench the
darts of the devil. Has any base lust assaulted thee? Hold before thee
thy faith in the good things to come, and it will not even show itself,
yea, it will perish.” “All the darts”; not some quenched, and others
not. Hearken to what Paul saith, “For I reckon that the sufferings of
this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that
shall be revealed to us-ward.” ([Rom. viii.
18](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#018.md)<span
id="iii.iv.xxv-p29.1"></span>.) Seest thou how many darts the righteous
quenched in those days? Seemeth it not to thee to be “fiery darts,” when
the patriarch burned with inward fire, as he was offering up his son?
Yea, and other righteous men also have quenched “all his darts.” Whether
then they be reasonings that assault us, let us hold out this; or
whether they be base desires, let us use this; or whether again labors
and distresses, upon this let us repose. Of all the other armor, this is
the safeguard; if we have not this, they will be quickly pierced
through. “Withal,” saith he, “taking up the shield of faith.” What is
the meaning of “withal”? It means both “in truth,” and “in
righteousness,” and “in the preparation of the gospel”; that is to say,
all these have need of the aid of faith.

<span id="iii.iv.xxv-p30"></span>And therefore he adds further, “and
take the helmet of salvation”; that is to say, finally by this shall ye
be able to be in security. To receive the helmet of salvation is to
escape the peril. For as the helmet covers the head perfectly in every
part, and suffers it not to sustain any injury, but preserves it, so
also does faith supply alike the place of a shield, and of a
helmet <span id="fr_495"></span>[496](#fn_495.md) to preserve us. For if we
quench his darts, quickly shall we receive also those saving thoughts
that suffer not our governing principle <span
id="fr_496"></span>[497](#fn_496.md) to sustain any harm; for if these, the
thoughts that are adverse to our salvation, are quenched, those which
are not so, but which contribute to our salvation, and inspire us with
good hopes, will be generated within us, and will rest upon our
governing principle, as a helmet does upon the head.

<span id="iii.iv.xxv-p33"></span>And not only this, but we shall take
also “the sword of the Spirit,” and thus not only ward off his missiles,
but smite the devil himself. For a soul that does not despair of
herself, and is proof against those fiery darts, will stand with all
intrepidity to face the enemy, and will cleave open his breastplate with
this very sword with which Paul also burst through it, and “brought into
captivity his devices” ([2 Cor. x.
5](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#005.md)<span
id="iii.iv.xxv-p33.1"></span>.); he will cut off and behead the serpent.

<span id="iii.iv.xxv-p34"></span>“Which is the word of God.”

<span id="iii.iv.xxv-p35"></span>By the “word of God” in this place, he
means on the one hand the ordinance of God, or the word of command; or
on the other that it is in the Name of Christ. For if we keep his
commandments, by these we shall kill and slay the dragon himself, “the
crooked serpent.” ([Isa. xxvii. 1](../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#001.md)<span
id="iii.iv.xxv-p35.1"></span>.) And as he said, “Ye shall be able to
quench the fiery darts of the evil one”; that he might not puff them up,
he shows them, that above all things they stand in need of God; for what
does he say?

<span id="iii.iv.xxv-p36"></span>“With all prayer and supplication,” he
says, these things shall be done, and ye shall accomplish all by
praying. But when thou drawest near, never ask for thyself only: thus
shalt thou have God favorable to thee.

<span id="iii.iv.xxv-p37"></span>“With all prayer and supplication,
praying at all seasons in the Spirit, and watching thereunto in all
perseverance for all the saints.” Limit it not, I say, to certain times
of the day, for hear what he is saying; approach at all times; “pray,”
saith he, “without ceasing.” ([1 Thess. v.
17](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#017.md)<span
id="iii.iv.xxv-p37.1"></span>.) Hast thou never heard of that widow, how
by her importunity she prevailed? ([Luke xviii.
1-7](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#001.md)<span
id="iii.iv.xxv-p37.2"></span>.) Hast thou never heard of that friend,
who at midnight shamed his friend into yielding by his perseverance?
([Luke xi. 5-8](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#005.md)<span
id="iii.iv.xxv-p37.3"></span>.) Hast thou not heard of the Syrophœnician
woman ([Mark vii. 25-30](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#025.md)<span
id="iii.iv.xxv-p37.4"></span>.), how by the constancy of her entreaty
she called forth the Lord’s compassion? These all of them gained their
object by their importunity.

<span id="iii.iv.xxv-p38"></span>“Praying at all seasons,” saith he, “in
the Spirit.”

<span id="iii.iv.xxv-p39"></span>That is to say, let us seek for the
things which are according to God, nothing of this world, nothing
pertaining to this life.

<span id="iii.iv.xxv-p40"></span><span id="page_170">p. 170</span> <span
id="iii.iv.xxv-Page_170"></span>Therefore, is there need not only that
we “pray without ceasing,” but also, that we should do so “watching;—and
watching,” saith he, “thereunto.” Whether he is here speaking of
vigils; <span id="fr_497"></span>[498](#fn_497.md) or of the wakefulness of
the soul, I admit both meanings. Seest thou how that Canaanitish woman
watched unto prayer? and though the Lord gave her no answer, nay, even
shook her off, and called her a dog, she said, “Yea, Lord: for even the
dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table” ([Matt. xv.
27](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#027.md)<span
id="iii.iv.xxv-p41.1"></span>.), and desisted not until she obtained her
request. How, too, did that widow cry, and persist so long, until she
was able to shame into yielding that ruler, that neither feared God, nor
regarded man ([Luke xviii. 1-7](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#001.md)<span
id="iii.iv.xxv-p41.2"></span>.)? And how, again, did the friend persist,
remaining before the door in the dead of night, till he shamed the other
into yielding by his importunity, and made him arise. ([Luke xi.
5-8](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#005.md)<span
id="iii.iv.xxv-p41.3"></span>.) This is to be watchful.

<span id="iii.iv.xxv-p42"></span>Wouldest thou understand what
watchfulness in prayer is? Go to Hannah, hearken to her very words,
“Adonai Eloi Sabaoth.” ([1 Sam. i.
11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#011.md)<span
id="iii.iv.xxv-p42.1"></span>.) Nay, rather, hear what preceded those
words; “they all rose up,” says the history, “from the table” ([1 Sam.
i. 9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#009.md)<span
id="iii.iv.xxv-p42.2"></span>.), and she, forthwith, did not betake
herself to sleep, nor to repose. Whence she appears to me even when she
was sitting at the table to have partaken lightly, and not to have been
made heavy with viands. Otherwise never could she have shed so many
tears; for if we, when we are fasting and foodless, hardly pray thus, or
rather never pray thus, much more would not she ever have prayed thus
after a meal, unless even at the meal she had been as they that eat not.
Let us be ashamed, us that are men, at the example of this woman; let us
be ashamed, that are suing and gasping for a kingdom, at her, praying
and weeping for a little child. “And she stood,” it says, “before the
Lord” ([1 Sam. i. 10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#010.md)<span
id="iii.iv.xxv-p42.3"></span>.); and what are her words? “Adonai, Lord,
Eloi Sabaoth!” and this is, being interpreted, “O Lord, the God of
Hosts.” Her tears went before her tongue; by these she hoped to prevail
with God to bend to her request. Where tears are, there is always
affliction also: where affliction is, there is great wisdom and
heedfulness. “If thou wilt indeed,” she continues, “look on the
affliction of thine handmaid, and wilt give unto thine handmaid a man
child, then will I give him unto the Lord all the days of his life.” ([1
Sam. i. 11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#011.md)<span
id="iii.iv.xxv-p42.4"></span>.) She said not, “for one year,” or, “for
two,” as we do;—nor said she, “if thou wilt give me a child, I will give
thee money”; but, “I give back to Thee the very gift itself entire, my
first-born, the son of my prayer.” Truly here was a daughter of Abraham.
He gave when it was demanded of him. She offers even before it is
demanded.

<span id="iii.iv.xxv-p43"></span>But observe even after this her deep
reverence. “Only her lips moved, but her voice,” it saith, “was not
heard.” ([1 Sam. i. 13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#013.md)<span
id="iii.iv.xxv-p43.1"></span>.) And thus does he who would gain his
request draw nigh unto God; not consulting his ease, nor gaping, nor
lounging, nor scratching his head, nor with utter listlessness. What,
was not God able to grant, even without any prayer at all? What, did He
not know the woman’s desire even before she asked? And yet had He
granted it before she asked, then the woman’s earnestness would not have
been shown, her virtue would not have been made manifest, she would not
have gained so great a reward. So that the delay is not the result of
envy or of witchcraft, but of providential kindness. When therefore ye
hear the Scripture saying, that “the Lord had shut up her womb” ([1 Sam.
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#005.md),
[6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#006.md)<span
id="iii.iv.xxv-p43.2"></span>.), and that, “her rival provoked her
sore”; consider that it is His intention to prove the woman’s
seriousness. <span id="fr_498"></span>[499](#fn_498.md) For, mark, she had
a husband devoted to her, for he said ([1 Sam.
1.8](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#008.md)<span
id="iii.iv.xxv-p44.1"></span>.), “Am I not better to thee than ten
sons?” “And her rival,” it saith, “provoked her sore,” that is,
reproached her, insulted over her. And yet did she never once retaliate,
nor utter imprecation against her, nor say, “Avenge me, for my rival
reviles me.” The other had children, but this woman had her husband’s
love to make amends. With this at least he even consoled her, saying,
“Am not I better to thee than ten sons?”

<span id="iii.iv.xxv-p45"></span>But let us look, again, at the deep
wisdom of this woman. “And Eli,” it says, “thought she had been
drunken.” ([1 Sam. 1.13](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#013.md)<span
id="iii.iv.xxv-p45.1"></span>.) Yet observe what she says to him also,
“Nay, count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial, for out of the
abundance of my complaint and my provocation have I spoken hitherto.”
([1 Sam. 1.16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#016.md)<span
id="iii.iv.xxv-p45.2"></span>.) Here is truly the proof of a contrite
heart, when we are not angry with those that revile us, when we are not
indignant against them, when we reply but in self-defense. Nothing
renders the heart so wise as affliction; nothing is there so sweet as
“godly mourning.” ([2 Cor. vii.
10](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#010.md)<span
id="iii.iv.xxv-p45.3"></span>.) “Out of the abundance,” saith she, “of
my complaint and my provocation have I spoken hitherto.” Her let us
imitate, one and all. Hearken, ye that are barren, hearken, ye that
desire children, hearken, both husbands and wives; yes, for husbands,
too, used oftentimes to contribute their part; for hear what the
Scripture saith, “And Isaac intreated the Lord for Rebekah his wife,
because she was barren.” ([Gen. xxv.

id="iii.iv.xxv-p45.4"></span>.) For prayer is able to accomplish great
things.

<span id="iii.iv.xxv-p46"></span><span id="page_171">p. 171</span> <span
id="iii.iv.xxv-Page_171"></span>“With all prayer and supplication,”
saith he, “for all the saints, and for me,” placing himself last. What
doest thou, O blessed Paul, in thus placing thyself last? Yea, saith he,
“that utterance may be given unto me, in opening my mouth, to make known
with boldness the mystery of the gospel, for which I am an ambassador in
chains.” And where art thou an ambassador? “To mankind,” saith he. Oh!
amazing lovingkindness of God! He sent from Heaven in His own Name
ambassadors for peace, and lo, men took them, and bound them, and
reverenced not so much as the law of nations, that an ambassador never
suffers any hurt. “But, however, I am an ambassador in bonds. The chain
lies like a bridle upon me, restraining my boldness, but your prayer
shall open my mouth” in order that I may speak all things I was sent to
speak.

<span id="iii.iv.xxv-p47"></span>“But that ye also may know my affairs,
how I do, Tychicus, the beloved brother, and faithful minister in the
Lord, shall make known to you all things.” If “faithful,” he will tell
no falsehood, he will in everything speak the truth:—“whom I have sent
unto you for this very purpose, that ye might know our state, and that
he may comfort your hearts.” Amazing, transcendent affection! “that it
may not be in the power,” he means, “of them that would, to affright
you.” For it is probable that they were in tribulation; for the
expression, “may comfort your hearts,” intimates as much; that is, “may
not suffer you to sink under it.”

<span id="iii.iv.xxv-p48"></span>[Eph.
6.23](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#023.md)<span
id="iii.iv.xxv-p48.1"></span>. “Peace be to the brethren and love with
faith from God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.”

<span id="iii.iv.xxv-p49"></span>He invokes upon them, “peace and love
with faith.” He saith well: for he would not that they should have
regard to love by itself, and mingle themselves with those of a
different faith. Either he means this, or that above described, namely,
that they should have faith also, so as to have a cheerful confidence of
the good things to come. The “peace” which is towards God, and the
“love.” And if there be peace, there will also be love; if love, there
will be peace also. “With faith,” because without faith, love amounts to
nothing; or rather love could not exist at all without it.

<span id="iii.iv.xxv-p50"></span>[Eph.
6.24](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#024.md)<span
id="iii.iv.xxv-p50.1"></span>. “Grace be with all them that love our
Lord Jesus Christ in uncorruptness.”

<span id="iii.iv.xxv-p51"></span>Why does he separate the two here,
placing “peace” by itself, and “grace” by itself?

<span id="iii.iv.xxv-p52"></span>“In uncorruptness,” he concludes.

<span id="iii.iv.xxv-p53"></span>What is this, “in uncorruptness”? It
either means, “in purity”; or else, “for the sake of those things which
are incorruptible,” as, for example, not in riches, nor in glory, but in
those treasures which are incorruptible. The “in” means, “through.”
“Through uncorruptness,” that is, “through virtue.” <span
id="fr_499"></span>[500](#fn_499.md) Because all sin is corruption. And in
the same way as we say a virgin is corrupted, so also do we speak of the
soul. Hence Paul says, “Lest by any means your minds should be
corrupted.” ([2 Cor. xi. 3](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#003.md)<span
id="iii.iv.xxv-p54.2"></span>.) And again elsewhere, he says, “In
doctrine, showing uncorruptness.” <span
id="fr_500"></span>[501](#fn_500.md) For what, tell me, is corruption of
the body? Is it not the dissolution of the whole frame, and of its
union? This then is what takes place also in the soul when sin enters.
The beauty of the soul is temperance, and righteousness; the health of
the soul is courage, and prudence; for the base man is hideous in our
eyes, so is the covetous, so is the man who gives himself up to evil
practices, and so the coward and unmanly man is sick, and the foolish
man is out of health. Now that sins work corruption, is evident from
this, that they render men base, and weak, and cause them to be sick and
diseased. Nay, and when we say that a virgin is corrupted, we say so,
strictly speaking, on this account also, not only because the body is
defiled, but because of the transgression. For the mere act is natural;
and if in that consisted the “corruption,” then were marriage
corruption. Hence is it not the act that is corruption, but the sin, for
it dishonors and puts her to shame. And again, what would be corruption
in the case of a house? Its dissolution. And so, universally, corruption
is a change which takes place for the worse, a change into another
state, to the utter extinction of the former one. For hear what the
Scripture saith, “All flesh had corrupted his way” ([Gen. vi.
12](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#012.md)<span
id="iii.iv.xxv-p55.2"></span>.); and again, “In intolerable
corruption” <span id="fr_501"></span>[502](#fn_501.md) ([Ex. xviii.
18](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#018.md)<span
id="iii.iv.xxv-p56.1"></span>.); and again, “Men corrupted in mind.” ([2
Tim. iii. 8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#008.md)<span
id="iii.iv.xxv-p56.2"></span>.) Our body is corruptible, but our soul is
incorruptible. Oh then, let us not make that corruptible also. This, the
corruption of the body, was the work of former sin; <span
id="fr_502"></span>[503](#fn_502.md) but sin which is after the Laver, has
the power also to render the soul corruptible, and to make it an easy
prey to “the worm that dieth not.” For never had that worm touched it,
had it not found the soul corruptible. The worm touches not adamant, and
even if he touches it, he can do it no harm. Oh then, corrupt not the
soul; for that which is corrupted is full of foul stench; for hearken to
the Prophet who saith, “My wounds stink and are corrupt because of my
foolishness.” ([Ps. xxxviii. 5](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#005.md)<span
id="iii.iv.xxv-p57.2"></span>.)

<span id="iii.iv.xxv-p58"></span><span id="page_172">p. 172</span> <span
id="iii.iv.xxv-Page_172"></span>However, “this corruption” of the body
“shall put on incorruption” ([1 Cor. xv.
53](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#053.md)<span
id="iii.iv.xxv-p58.1"></span>.), but the other of the soul, never; for
where incorruption is, there is no <span
id="fr_503"></span>[504](#fn_503.md) corruption. Thus is it a corruption
which is incorruptible, which hath no end, a deathless death; which
would have been, had the body remained deathless. Now if we shall depart
into the next world having not corruption, we have that corruption
incorruptible and endless; for to be ever burning, and not burnt up,
ever wasted by the worm, is corruption incorruptible; like as was the
case with the blessed Job. He was corrupted, and died not, and that
through a lengthened period, and “wasted continually, scraping the clods
of dust from his sore.” <span id="fr_504"></span>[505](#fn_504.md) Some
such torment as this shall it undergo, when the worms surround and
devour it, not for two years nor for three, nor for ten, nor for ten
thousand, but for years without end; for “their worm,” saith He, “dieth
not.”

<span id="iii.iv.xxv-p61"></span><span class="c13"><span
id="iii.iv.xxv-p61.1"></span>Moral</span>. Let us take the alarm then, I
entreat you, let us dread the words, that we meet not with the
realities. Covetousness is corruption, corruption more dangerous than
any other, and leading on to idolatry. Let us shun the corruption, let
us choose the incorruption. Hast thou in covetousness overreached and
defrauded some one? The fruits of thy covetousness perish, but the
covetousness remains; a corruption which is the foundation of
incorruptible corruption. The enjoyment indeed passes away, but the sin
remains imperishable. A fearful evil is it for us not to strip ourselves
of everything in this present world; a great calamity to depart into the
next with loads of sins about us. “For in Sheol,” it is said “who shall
give Thee thanks?” ([Ps. vi. 5](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#005.md)<span
id="iii.iv.xxv-p61.2"></span>.) There is the place of judgment; then is
there no longer season for repentance. How many things did the rich man
bewail then? ([Luke xvi. 23](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#023.md)<span
id="iii.iv.xxv-p61.3"></span>.) And yet it availed him nothing. How many
things did they say who had neglected to feed Christ? ([Matt. xxv.
41](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#041.md)<span
id="iii.iv.xxv-p61.4"></span>.) Yet were they led away notwithstanding
into the everlasting fire. How many things had they then to say: “that
had wrought iniquity”; “Lord, did we not prophesy by Thy Name, and by
Thy Name cast out devils?” And yet notwithstanding, they were not owned.
All these things therefore will take place then; but it will be of no
avail, if they be not done now. Let us fear then, lest ever we should
have to say then, “Lord, when saw we Thee an hungered, and fed Thee
not?” ([Matt. xxv. 44](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#044.md)<span
id="iii.iv.xxv-p61.5"></span>.) Let us feed Him now, not one day, nor
two, nor three days. “For let not mercy and truth,” saith the Wise Man,
“forsake thee.” ([Prov. iii. 3](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#003.md)<span
id="iii.iv.xxv-p61.6"></span>.) He saith not “do it once, nor twice.”
The Virgins, we know, had oil, but not enough to last out. ([Matt.
25:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#003.md),
[8](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#008.md)<span
id="iii.iv.xxv-p61.7"></span>.) And thus we need much oil, and thus
should we be “like a green olive tree in the house of God.” ([Ps. lii.
8](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#008)<span id="iii.iv.xxv-p61.8"></span>..md)
Let us reflect then how many burdens of sins each of us has about him,
and let us make our acts of mercy counterbalance them; nay rather, far
exceed them, that not only the sins may be quenched, but that the acts
of righteousness may be also accounted unto us for righteousness. For if
the good deeds be not so many in number as to put aside the crimes laid
against us, and out of the remainder to be counted unto us for
righteousness, <span id="fr_505"></span>[506](#fn_505.md) then shall no one
rescue us from that punishment, from which God grant that we may be all
delivered, through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus
Christ, with whom to the Father, &c.
