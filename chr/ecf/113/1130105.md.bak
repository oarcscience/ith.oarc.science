<span id="v.iii.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c10"><span
id="v.iii.xiii-p1.1"></span>Homily XII.</span>

<span id="v.iii.xiii-p2"></span><span id="v.iii.xiii-p2.1"></span><span
class="c1"><span id="v.iii.xiii-p2.2"></span>[1 Timothy iv.
1-3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#001.md)<span
id="v.iii.xiii-p2.3"></span></span>

<span id="v.iii.xiii-p3"></span>“Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that
in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to
seducing spirits, and doctrines of demons; speaking lies in hypocrisy;
having their conscience seared with a hot iron; forbidding to marry, and
commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received
with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth.”

<span id="v.iii.xiii-p4"></span><span class="c13"><span
id="v.iii.xiii-p4.1"></span>As</span> those who adhere to the faith are
fixed on a safe anchor, so those who fall from the faith can nowhere
rest; but after many wanderings to and fro, they are borne at last into
the very gulf of perdition. And this he had shown before, saying, that
some had “already made shipwreck concerning the faith,” and now he says,
“Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall
depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits.” This is said of
the Manichæans, the Encratites, <span
id="fr_1215"></span>[1216](#fn_1215.md) and the Marcionites, and the whole
of their tribe, <span id="fr_1216"></span>[1217](#fn_1216.md) that they
should hereafter depart from the faith. Seest thou that this departure
from the faith is the cause of all the evils that follow!

<span id="v.iii.xiii-p7"></span>But what is “expressly”? Plainly,
clearly, and beyond doubt. Marvel not, he says, if some having departed
from the faith still adhere to Judaism. There will be a time, when even
those who have partaken of the faith will fall into a worse error, not
only with respect to meats, but to marriages, and other such things,
introducing the most pernicious notions. This refers not to the Jews,
(for “the latter times,” and a “departure from the faith,” is not
applicable to them;) but to the Manichees, and the founders of these
sects. And he calls them very justly, “seducing spirits,” since it was
by these they were actuated in speaking such things. “Speaking lies in
hypocrisy.” This implies that they utter not these falsehoods through
ignorance and unknowingly, but as acting a part, knowing the truth, but
“having their conscience seared,” that is, being men of evil lives.

<span id="v.iii.xiii-p8"></span>But why does he speak only of these
heretics? Christ had before said, “Offenses must need come” ([Matt.
xviii. 7](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#007.md)<span
id="v.iii.xiii-p8.1"></span>.), and he had predicted the same in his
parable of the sower, and of the <span id="page_445">p. 445</span> <span
id="v.iii.xiii-Page_445"></span>springing up of the tares. But here
admire with me the prophetic gift of Paul, who, before the times in
which they were to appear, specifies the time itself. As if he had said,
Do not wonder, if, at the commencement of the faith, some endeavor to
bring in these pernicious doctrines; since, after it has been
established for a length of time, many shall depart from the faith.
“Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats.” Why then
has he mentioned no other heresies? Though not particularized, they are
implied by the expressions of “seducing spirits and doctrines of
demons.” But he did not wish to instill these things into the minds of
men before the time; but that which had already commenced, the case of
meats, he specifies. “Which God hath created to be received with
thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth.” Why did he not
say, by the unbelievers too? How by the unbelievers, when they exclude
themselves from them by their own rules? But is not luxury forbidden?
Certainly it is. But why? if good things are created to be received.
Because He created bread, and yet too much is forbidden; and wine also,
and yet excess is forbidden; and we are not commanded to avoid dainties
as if they were unclean in themselves, but as they corrupt the soul by
excess.

<span id="v.iii.xiii-p9"></span>[1 Tim.
4.4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#004.md)<span id="v.iii.xiii-p9.1"></span>.
“For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be
received with thanksgiving.”

<span id="v.iii.xiii-p10"></span>If it be the creature of God, it is
good. For “all things,” it is said, “were very good.” ([Gen. i.
31](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#031.md)<span
id="v.iii.xiii-p10.1"></span>.) By speaking thus of things eatable, he
by anticipation impugns the heresy of those who introduce an uncreated
matter, and assert that these things proceed from it. But if it is good,
why is it “sanctified by the word of God and prayers”? For it must be
unclean, if it is to be sanctified? Not so, here he is speaking to those
who thought that some of these things were common; therefore he lays
down two positions: first, that no creature of God is unclean: secondly,
that if it were become so, you have a remedy, seal it, <span
id="fr_1217"></span>[1218](#fn_1217.md) give thanks, and glorify God, and
all the uncleanness passes away. Can we then so cleanse that which is
offered to an idol? If you know not that it was so offered. But if,
knowing this, you partake of it, you will be unclean; not because it was
offered to an idol, but because contrary to an express command, you
thereby communicate with devils. So that it is not unclean by nature,
but becomes so through your wilful disobedience. What then, is not
swine’s flesh unclean? By no means, when it is received with
thanksgiving, and with the seal; nor is anything else. It is your
unthankful disposition to God that is unclean.

<span id="v.iii.xiii-p12"></span>[1 Tim.
4.6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#006.md)<span
id="v.iii.xiii-p12.1"></span>. “If thou put the brethren in remembrance
of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ,
nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou
hast attained.”

<span id="v.iii.xiii-p13"></span>What are the things here meant? The
same which he had before mentioned, that “great is the mystery”; that to
abstain from meats is the doctrine of devils, that they are “cleansed by
the word of God and prayer.”

<span id="v.iii.xiii-p14"></span>[1 Tim.
4.7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#007.md)<span
id="v.iii.xiii-p14.1"></span>. “But refuse profane and old wives’
fables, and exercise thyself rather unto godliness.”

<span id="v.iii.xiii-p15"></span>“Putting them in remembrance,” he says;
here you observe no authority; but all is condescension: he does not say
“commanding” or “enjoining,” but reminding them: that is, suggest these
things as matter of advice, and so enter into discourses with them
concerning the faith, “being nourished up,” he says, meaning to imply
constancy in application to these things.

<span id="v.iii.xiii-p16"></span>For as we set before us day by day this
bodily nourishment, so he means, let us be continually receiving
discourses concerning the faith, and ever be nourished with them. What
is this, “being nourished up”? Ruminating upon them; attending ever to
the same things, and practicing ever the same, for it is no common
nourishment that they supply.

<span id="v.iii.xiii-p17"></span>“But refuse profane and old wives’
fables.” By these are meant Jewish traditions, and he calls them
“fables,” either because of their falsehood or their unseasonableness.
For what is seasonable is useful, but what is unseasonable is not only
useless but injurious. Suppose a man of adult age to be suckled by a
nurse, would he not be ridiculous, because it is unseasonable? “Profane
and old wives’ fables,” he calls them, partly because of their
obsoleteness, and partly because they are impediments to faith. For to
bring souls under fear, that are raised above these things, is an
impious commandment. “Exercise thyself unto godliness.” That is, unto a
pure faith and a moral life; for this is godliness. So then we need
“exercise.”

<span id="v.iii.xiii-p18"></span>[1 Tim.
4.8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#008.md)<span
id="v.iii.xiii-p18.1"></span>. “For bodily exercise <span
id="fr_1218"></span>[1219](#fn_1218.md) profiteth little.” This has by some
been referred to fasting; but away with such a notion! for that is not a
bodily but a spiritual exercise. If it were bodily it would nourish the
body, whereas it wastes and makes it lean, so that it is not bodily.
Hence he is not speaking of the discipline <span
id="fr_1219"></span>[1220](#fn_1219.md) of the body. What we need,
therefore, is the exercise <span id="fr_1220"></span>[1221](#fn_1220.md) of
the soul. For the exercise of the body hath no profit, but may benefit
the body a little, but the exercise <span
id="fr_1221"></span>[1222](#fn_1221.md) of godliness yields fruit and
advantage both here and hereafter.

<span id="v.iii.xiii-p23"></span><span id="page_446">p. 446</span> <span
id="v.iii.xiii-Page_446"></span>“This is a faithful saying,” that is, it
is true that godliness is profitable both here and hereafter. Observe
how everywhere he brings in this, he needs no demonstration, but simply
declares it, for he was addressing Timothy.

<span id="v.iii.xiii-p24"></span>So then even here, we have good hopes?
For he who is conscious to himself of no evil, and who has been fruitful
in good, rejoices even here: as the wicked man on the other hand is
punished here as well as hereafter. He lives in perpetual fear, he can
look no one in the face with confidence, he is pale, trembling, and full
of anxiety. Is it not so with the fraudulent, and with thieves, who have
no satisfaction even in what they possess? Is not the life of murderers
and adulterers most wretched, who look upon the sun itself with
suspicion? Is this to be called life? No; rather a horrid death!

<span id="v.iii.xiii-p25"></span>[1 Tim.
4.10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#010.md)<span
id="v.iii.xiii-p25.1"></span>. “For therefore we both labor and suffer
reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all
men, specially of them that believe.”

<span id="v.iii.xiii-p26"></span>This in effect is to say, wherefore do
we mortify ourselves, unless we expect future blessings? Have we endured
so many evils, submitted to so many reproaches, suffered such insults
and calumnies, and such numerous calamities in vain? For if we did not
trust in the living God, on what account did we submit to these things?
But if God is here the Saviour <span
id="fr_1222"></span>[1223](#fn_1222.md) of the unbelieving, much more is He
of the faithful hereafter. What salvation does he speak of? That to
come? <span id="fr_1223"></span>[1224](#fn_1223.md) “Who is the Saviour,”
he says, “of all men, specially of them that believe.” At present he is
speaking of that which is here. But how is He the Saviour of the
faithful? Had he not been so, they must long since have been destroyed,
for all men have made war upon them. He calls him here to endure perils,
that having God for his Saviour he may not faint nor need any aid from
others, but willingly and with fortitude endure all things. Even those
who eagerly grasp at worldly advantages, supported by the hope of gain,
cheerfully undertake laborious enterprises.

<span id="v.iii.xiii-p29"></span>It is then the last time. For “in the
latter times,” he says, “some shall depart from the faith.” “Forbidding
to marry.” And do not we forbid to marry? God forbid. We do not forbid
those who wish to marry, but those who do not wish to marry, we exhort
to virginity. It is one thing to forbid, and another to leave one to his
own free choice. He that forbids, does it once for all, but he who
recommends virginity as a higher state, does not forbid marriage,
because he prefers virginity.

<span id="v.iii.xiii-p30"></span>“Forbidding to marry,” he says, “and
commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received
with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth.” It is well
said, “who know the truth.” The former things then were a type. For
nothing is unclean by nature, but it becomes so through the conscience
of him that partakes of it. And what was the object of the prohibition
of so many meats? To restrain excessive luxury. But had it been said,
“eat not for the sake of luxury,” it would not have been borne. They
were therefore shut up under the necessity of the law, that they might
abstain from the stronger principle of fear. The fish was not forbidden,
though it was manifestly more unclean than the swine. But they might
have learned how pernicious luxury was from that saying of Moses,
“Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked.” ([Deut. xxxii.
15](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#015.md)<span
id="v.iii.xiii-p30.1"></span>.) Another cause of these prohibitions
might be, that being straitened for other food, they might be reduced to
slaughter sheep and oxen; he therefore restrained them from other
things, on account of Apis and the calf, which was an abomination,
ungrateful, polluted, and profane. <span
id="fr_1224"></span>[1225](#fn_1224.md)

<span id="v.iii.xiii-p32"></span>“Put them in remembrance of these
things, meditate upon <span id="fr_1225"></span>[1226](#fn_1225.md) these
things,” for by the expression, “nourished up in the words of faith and
sound doctrine,” is implied that he should not only recommend these
things to others, but himself practice them. For he says, “Nourished up
in the words of faith, and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast
attained. But refuse profane and old wives’ fables.” Why does he not
say, abstain from them, but “refuse”? He thus intimates that they should
be utterly rejected. His meaning is, that he should not enter into any
disputation with the teachers of them, but recommend to his own people
the things prescribed above. For nothing is to be gained by contending
with perverse men, unless where it might have an injurious effect, if we
were supposed from weakness to decline arguing with them.

<span id="v.iii.xiii-p34"></span>“But exercise thyself unto godliness,”
that is, unto a pure life, and the most virtuous conversation. He that
exerciseth himself, even when it is not the season of contest, acts
always as if he were contending, practices abstinence, endures all
toils, is always anxious, endures much labor. “Exercise thyself,” he
saith, “unto godliness; for bodily exercise profiteth little, but
godliness is profitable for all things, having the promise of the life
that now is, and of that which is to come.” And why, says one, does he
mention this bodily exercise? To show by comparison the superiority of
the other, in that the former <span id="page_447">p. 447</span> <span
id="v.iii.xiii-Page_447"></span>is of no solid advantage, though it is
attended with many toils, whilst the latter has a lasting and abundant
good. As when he bids women “adorn themselves, not with broidered hair,
or gold, or costly array: but which becometh women possessing godliness;
with good works.” ([1 Tim. 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#009.md),
[10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#010.md)<span
id="v.iii.xiii-p34.1"></span>)

<span id="v.iii.xiii-p35"></span><span class="c13"><span
id="v.iii.xiii-p35.1"></span>Moral</span>. “This is a faithful saying,
and worthy of all acceptation. For therefore we both labor and suffer
reproach.” Did Paul then suffer reproach, and art thou impatient? Did
Paul labor, and wouldest thou live luxuriously? But had he lived
luxuriously, he would never have attained such great blessings. For if
worldly goods, which are uncertain and perishable, are never gained by
men without labor and pains, much less are spiritual. Well, saith one,
but some inherit them. Yet even when inherited they are not guarded and
preserved without labor, and care, and trouble, no less than those have
that have gained them. And I need not say that many who have toiled and
endured hardships have been disappointed at the very entrance of the
harbor, and an adverse wind has caused the wreck of their hopes, when
they were upon the point of possession. But with us there is nothing
like this. For it is God who promised, and that “hope maketh not
ashamed.” ([Rom. v. 5](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#005.md)<span
id="v.iii.xiii-p35.2"></span>.) Ye who are conversant with worldly
affairs, know ye not how many men, after infinite toils, have not
enjoyed the fruit of their labors, either being previously cut off by
death, or overtaken by misfortune, or assailed by disease, or ruined by
false accusers, or some other cause, which amidst the variety of human
casualties, has forced them to go with empty hands?

<span id="v.iii.xiii-p36"></span>But do you not see the lucky men, says
one, who with little labor acquire the good things of life? What good
things? Money, houses, so many acres of land, trains of servants, heaps
of gold and silver? Can you call these good things, and not hide your
head for shame? A man called to the pursuit of heavenly wisdom, and
gaping after worldly things, and calling them “goods,” which are of no
value! If these things are good, then the possessors of them must be
called good. For is not he good, who is the possessor of what is good?
But when the possessors of these things are guilty of fraud and rapine,
shall we call them good? For if wealth is a good, but is increased by
grasping, the more it is increased, the more will its possessor be
considered to be good. Is the grasping man then good? But if wealth is
good, and increases by grasping, the more a man grasps, the better he
must be. Is not this plainly a contradiction? But suppose the wealth is
not gained wrongfully. And how is this possible? So destructive a
passion is avarice, that to grow rich without injustice is impossible.
This Christ declared, saying, “Make to yourselves friends of the Mammon
of unrighteousness.” ([Luke xvi.
19](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#019.md)<span
id="v.iii.xiii-p36.1"></span>.) But what if he succeeded to his father’s
inheritance? Then he received what had been gathered by injustice. For
it was not from Adam that his ancestor inherited riches, but, of the
many that were before him, some one must probably have unjustly taken
and enjoyed the goods of others. What then? he says, did Abraham hold
unrighteous wealth; and Job, that blameless, righteous, and faithful
man, who “feared God and eschewed evil”? Theirs was a wealth that
consisted not in gold and silver, nor in houses, but in cattle. Besides
this, he was enriched by God. <span id="fr_1226"></span>[1227](#fn_1226.md)
And the author of that book, relating what happened to that blessed man,
mentions the loss of his camels, his mares and asses, but does not speak
of treasures of gold or silver being taken away. The riches of Abraham
too were his domestics. What then? Did he not buy them? No, for to this
very point the Scripture says, that the three hundred and eighteen were
born in his house. ([Gen. xix. 14](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#014.md)<span
id="v.iii.xiii-p37.1"></span>.) He had also sheep and oxen. Whence then
did he send gold to Rebekah? ([Gen.
24:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#022.md), [Gen.
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#016.md)<span
id="v.iii.xiii-p37.2"></span>.) From the gifts which he received from
Egypt without violence or wrong.

<span id="v.iii.xiii-p38"></span>Tell me, then, whence art thou rich?
From whom didst thou receive it, and from whom he who transmitted it to
thee? From his father and his grandfather. But canst thou, ascending
through many generations, show the acquisition just? It cannot be. The
root and origin of it must have been injustice. Why? Because God in the
beginning made not one man rich, and another poor. Nor did He afterwards
take and show to one treasures of gold, and deny to the other the right
of searching for it: but He left the earth free to all alike. Why then,
if it is common, have you so many acres of land, while your neighbor has
not a portion of it? It was transmitted to me by my father. And by whom
to him? By his forefathers. But you must go back and find the original
owner. Jacob had wealth, but it was earned as the hire of his labors.

<span id="v.iii.xiii-p39"></span>But I will not urge this argument too
closely. Let your riches be justly gained, and without rapine. For you
are not responsible for the covetous acts of your father. Your wealth
may be derived from rapine; but you were not the plunderer. Or granting
that he did not obtain it by robbery, that his gold was cast up
somewhere out of the earth. What then? Is wealth therefore good? By no
means. At the same time it is not bad, he says, if its possessor be not
covetous; it is not bad, if it be distributed <span id="page_448">p.
448</span> <span id="v.iii.xiii-Page_448"></span>to the poor, otherwise
it is bad, it is ensnaring. “But if he does not evil, though he does no
good, it is not bad,” he argues. True. But is not this an evil, that you
alone should have the Lord’s property, that you alone should enjoy what
is common? Is not “the earth God’s, and the fullness thereof”? If then
our possessions belong to one common Lord, they belong also to our
fellow-servants. The possessions of one Lord are all common. Do we not
see this the settled rule in great houses? To all is given an equal
portion of provisions, for it proceeds from the treasures of their Lord.
And the house of the master is opened to all. The king’s possessions are
all common, as cities, market-places, and public walks. We all share
them equally.

<span id="v.iii.xiii-p40"></span>Mark the wise dispensation of God. That
He might put mankind to shame, He hath made certain things common, as
the sun, air, earth, and water, the heaven, the sea, the light, the
stars; whose benefits are dispensed equally to all as brethren. We are
all formed with the same eyes, the same body, the same soul, the same
structure in all respects, <span id="fr_1227"></span>[1228](#fn_1227.md)
all things from the earth, all men from one man, and all in the same
habitation. But these are not enough to shame us. Other things then (as
we have said) He hath made common, as baths, cities, market-places,
walks. And observe, that concerning things that are common there is no
contention, but all is peaceable. But when one attempts to possess
himself of anything, to make it his own, then contention is introduced,
as if nature herself were indignant, that when God brings us together in
every way, we are eager to divide and separate ourselves by
appropriating things, and by using those cold words “mine and thine.”
Then there is contention and uneasiness. But where this is not, no
strife or contention is bred. This state therefore is rather our
inheritance, and more agreeable to nature. Why is it, that there is
never a dispute about a market-place? Is it not because it is common to
all? But about a house, and about property, men are always disputing.
Things necessary are set before us in common; but even in the least
things we do not observe a community. Yet those greater things He hath
opened freely to all, that we might thence be instructed to have these
inferior things in common. Yet for all this, we are not instructed.

<span id="v.iii.xiii-p42"></span>But as I said, how can he, who is rich,
be a good man? When he distributes his riches, he is good, so that he is
good when he has ceased to have it, when he gives it to others; but
whilst he keeps it himself, he is not good. How then is that a good
which being retained renders men evil, being parted with makes them
good? Not therefore to have wealth, but to have it not, makes one appear
to be good. Wealth therefore is not a good. But if, when you can receive
it, you receive it not, again you are good.

<span id="v.iii.xiii-p43"></span>If then we are good, when having it, we
distribute it to others; or when offered to us we refuse it, and if we
are not good, when we receive or gain it, how can it be a good thing in
itself? Call it not therefore a good. You possess it not, because you
think it a good, because you are anxious to possess it. Cleanse thy
mind, and rectify thy judgment, and then thou wilt be good. Learn what
are really goods. What are they? Virtue and benevolence. These and not
that, are truly good. According to this rule, the more charitable thou
art, the more good thou wilt be considered. But if thou art rich, thou
art no longer good. Let us therefore become thus good, that we may be
really good, and may obtain the good things to come in Jesus Christ,
with whom, &c.
