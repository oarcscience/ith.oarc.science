<span id="v.iv.iii-p2"></span><span id="v.iv.iii-p2.1"></span><span
class="c1"><span id="v.iv.iii-p2.2"></span>[2 Timothy i.
13-18](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#013.md)<span
id="v.iv.iii-p2.3"></span></span>

<span id="v.iv.iii-p3"></span>“Hold fast the form of sound words, which
thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. That
good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the Holy Ghost Which
dwelleth in us. This thou knowest, that all they which are in Asia be
turned away from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes. The Lord give
mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft refreshed me, and was
not ashamed of my chain: but, when he was in Rome, he sought me out very
diligently, and found me. The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy
of the Lord in that day: and in how many things he ministered unto me at
Ephesus, thou knowest very well.”

<span id="v.iv.iii-p4"></span><span class="c13"><span
id="v.iv.iii-p4.1"></span>Not</span> by letters alone did Paul instruct
his disciple in his duty, but before by words also which he shows, both
in many other passages, as where he says, “whether by word or our
Epistle” ([2 Thess. ii. 15](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#015.md)<span
id="v.iv.iii-p4.2"></span>.), and especially here. Let us not therefore
suppose that anything relating to doctrine was spoken imperfectly. For
many things he delivered to him without writing. Of these therefore he
reminds him, when he says, “Hold fast the form of sound words, which
thou hast heard of me.” After the manner of artists, I have impressed on
thee the image of virtue, fixing in thy soul a sort of rule, and model,
and outline of all things pleasing to God. These things then hold fast,
and whether thou art meditating any matter of faith or love, or of a
sound mind, form from hence your ideas of them. It will not be necessary
to have recourse to others for examples, when all has been deposited
within thyself.

<span id="v.iv.iii-p5"></span>“That good thing which was committed unto
thee keep,”—how?—“by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us.” For it is not
in the power of a human soul, when instructed with things so great, to
be sufficient for the keeping of them. And why? Because there are many
robbers, and thick darkness, and the devil still at hand to plot against
us; and we know not what is the hour, what the occasion for him to set
upon us. How then, he means, shall we be sufficient for the keeping of
them? “By the Holy Ghost”; that is if we have the Spirit <span
id="fr_1346"></span>[1347](#fn_1346.md) with us, if we do not expel grace,
He will stand by us. For, “Except the Lord build the house, they labor
in vain that build it. Except the Lord keep the city, the watchman
waketh but in vain.” ([Ps. cxxvii.
1](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#001)<span id="v.iv.iii-p6.1"></span>..md)
This is our wall, this our castle, this our refuge. If therefore It
dwelleth in us, and is Itself our guard, what need of the commandment?
That we may hold It fast, may keep It, and not banish It by our evil
deeds.

<span id="v.iv.iii-p7"></span>Then he describes his trials and
temptations, not to depress his disciple, but to elevate him, that if he
should ever fall into the same, he may not think it strange, when he
looks back and remembers what things happened to his Teacher. What then
says he? Since it was probable that Timothy might be apprehended, and be
deserted, and be relieved by no friendly attention, or influence, or
assistance, but be abandoned even by his friends and the faithful
themselves, hear what he says, “This thou knowest, that all they which
are in Asia be turned away from me.” It seems that there were then in
Rome many persons from the regions of Asia. “But no one stood by me,” he
says, no one acknowledged me, all were alienated. And observe the
philosophy of his soul. He only mentions their conduct, he does not
curse them, but he praises him that showed kindness to him, and invokes
a thousand blessings upon him, without any curse on them. “Of whom is
Phygellus and Hermogenes. The Lord give mercy to the house of
Onesiphorus, for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain.
But, when he was in Rome, he sought me out diligently and found me.”
Observe how he everywhere speaks of the shame, and not of the danger,
lest Timothy should be alarmed. And yet it was a thing that was full of
peril. For he gave offense to Nero by making friends with one of his
prisoners. <span id="fr_1347"></span>[1348](#fn_1347.md) But when he was in
Rome, he says, he not only did not shun intercourse with me, but “sought
me out very diligently, and found me.”

<span id="v.iv.iii-p9"></span>“The Lord grant unto him that he may find
mercy of the Lord in that day: and in how many things he ministered unto
me at Ephesus, thou knowest very well.”

<span id="v.iv.iii-p10"></span>Such ought the faithful to be. Neither
fear, nor threats, nor disgrace, should deter them from assisting one
another, standing by them and succoring them as in war. For they do not
so much benefit those who are in danger, as themselves, by the service
they render to them, making themselves partakers of the crowns due to
them. For example, is any one of those who are devoted to God visited
with affliction and distress, and maintaining the conflict with great
fortitude; whilst thou art not yet brought <span
id="fr_1348"></span>[1349](#fn_1348.md) to this conflict? It is in thy
power if thou wilt, <span id="page_485">p. 485</span> <span
id="v.iv.iii-Page_485"></span>without entering into the course, to be a
sharer of the crowns reserved for him, by standing by him, preparing his
mind, <span id="fr_1349"></span>[1350](#fn_1349.md) and animating and
exciting him. Hence it is that Paul elsewhere says, “Ye have done well
that ye did communicate with my affliction. For even in Thessalonica ye
sent once and again unto my necessity.” ([Phil.
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#014.md),
[16](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#016)<span id="v.iv.iii-p12.1"></span>..md)
And how could they that were far off share in the affliction of him that
was not with them? How? He says, “ye sent once and again unto my
necessities.” Again he says, speaking of Epaphroditus, “Because he was
nigh unto death, not regarding his life, that he might supply your lack
of service toward me.” ([Philip. ii.
30](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#030)<span id="v.iv.iii-p12.2"></span>..md)
For as in the service of kings, not only those who fight the battle, but
those who guard the baggage, share in the honor; and not merely so, but
frequently even have an equal portion of the spoils, though they have
not imbrued their hands in blood, nor stood in array, nor even seen the
ranks of the enemy; so it is in these conflicts. For he who relieves the
combatant, when wasted with hunger, who stands by him, encouraging him
by words, and rendering him every service, he is not inferior to the
combatant.

<span id="v.iv.iii-p13"></span>For do not suppose Paul the combatant,
that irresistible and invincible one, but some one of the many, who, if
he had not received much consolation and encouragement, would not
perhaps have stood, would not have contended. So those who are out of
the contest may perchance be the cause of victory to him, who is engaged
in it, and may be partakers of the crowns reserved for the victor. And
what wonder, if he who communicates to the living is thought worthy of
the same rewards with those who contend, since it is possible to
communicate after death even with the departed, with those who are
asleep, who are already crowned, who want for nothing. For hear Paul
saying, “Partaking in the memories of the Saints.” <span
id="fr_1350"></span>[1351](#fn_1350.md) And how may this be done? When thou
admirest a man, <span id="fr_1351"></span>[1352](#fn_1351.md) when thou
doest any of those acts for which he was crowned, thou art evidently a
sharer in his labors, and in his crowns.

<span id="v.iv.iii-p16"></span>“The Lord grant unto him that he may find
mercy of the Lord in that day.” He had compassion on me, he says, he
shall therefore have the like return in that terrible Day, when we shall
have need of much mercy. “The Lord grant him to find mercy from the
Lord.” Are there two Lords then? By no means. But “to us there is one
Lord Christ Jesus, and one God.” ([1 Cor. viii.
6](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#006)<span id="v.iv.iii-p16.1"></span>..md)
Here those who are infected with the heresy of Marcion assail this
expression; but let them learn that this mode of speech is not uncommon
in Scripture; as when it is said, “The Lord said unto my Lord” ([Ps. cx.
1](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#001)<span id="v.iv.iii-p16.2"></span>..md);
and again, “I said unto the Lord, Thou art my Lord” ([Ps. xvi.
2](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#002)<span id="v.iv.iii-p16.3"></span>..md);
and, “The Lord rained fire from the Lord.” ([Gen. xix.
24](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#024)<span id="v.iv.iii-p16.4"></span>..md)
This indicates that the Persons are of the same substance, not that
there is a distinction of nature. For we are not to understand that
there are two substances differing from each other, but two Persons,
each being of the same substance.

<span id="v.iv.iii-p17"></span>Observe too, that he says, “The Lord
grant him mercy.” For as he himself had obtained mercy from Onesiphorus,
so he wished him to obtain the same from God. <span class="c16"><span
id="v.iv.iii-p17.1"></span>Moral.</span> And if Onesiphorus, who exposed
himself to danger, is saved by mercy, much more are we also saved by the
same. For terrible indeed, terrible is that account, and such as needs
great love for mankind, that we may not hear that awful sentence,
“Depart from me…I never knew you, ye that work iniquity” ([Matt. vii.
23](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#023)<span id="v.iv.iii-p17.2"></span>..md);
or that fearful word, “Depart, ye cursed, into everlasting fire,
prepared for the devil and his angels” ([Matt. xxv.
40](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#040)<span id="v.iv.iii-p17.3"></span>..md):
that we may not hear, “Between us and you there is a great gulf fixed”
([Luke xvi. 16](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#016.md)<span
id="v.iv.iii-p17.4"></span>.): that we may not hear that voice full of
horror, “Take him away, and cast him into outer darkness”: that we may
not hear those words full of terror, “Thou wicked and slothful servant.”
([Matt. 22:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#013.md), [Matt.
25:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#026.md)<span
id="v.iv.iii-p17.5"></span>.) For awful truly and terrible is that
tribunal. And yet God is gracious and merciful. He is called a God “of
mercies and a God of comfort” ([2 Cor. i.
3](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#003)<span id="v.iv.iii-p17.6"></span>..md);
good as none else is good, and kind, and gentle, and full of pity, Who
“willeth not the death of a sinner, but that he should be converted and
live.” ([Ezek. 18:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#024.md), [Ezek.
33:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#011.md)<span
id="v.iv.iii-p17.7"></span>.) Whence then, whence is that Day so full of
agony and anguish? A stream of fire is rolling before His face. The
books of our deeds are opened. The day itself is burning as an oven, the
angels are flying around, and many furnaces are prepared. How then is He
good and merciful, and full of lovingkindness to man? Even herein is He
merciful, and He shows in these things the greatness of His
lovingkindness. For He holds forth to us these terrors, that being
constrained by them, we may be awakened to the desire of the kingdom.

<span id="v.iv.iii-p18"></span>And observe how, besides commending
Onesiphorus, he specifies his kindness, “he oft refreshed me”; like a
wearied wrestler overcome by heat, he refreshed and strengthened him in
his tribulations. And in how many things he ministered to me at Ephesus,
thou knowest very well. Not only at Ephesus, but here also he refreshed
me. For such ought to be the conduct of one on the watch and awakened to
good <span id="page_486">p. 486</span> <span
id="v.iv.iii-Page_486"></span>actions, not to work once, or twice, or
thrice, but through the whole of life. For as our body is not fed once
for all, and so provided with sustenance for a whole life, but needs
also daily food, so in this too, godliness requires to be supported
every day by good works. For we ourselves have need of great mercy. It
is on account of our sins that God, the Friend of man, does all these
things, not that He needs them Himself, but He does all for us. For
therefore it is that He has revealed them all, and made them known to
us, and not merely told us of them, but given us assurance of them by
what He has done. Though He was worthy of credit upon His word only,
that no one may think it is said hyperbolically, or in the way of
threatening merely, we have further assurance by His works. How? By the
punishments which He has inflicted both publicly and privately. And that
thou mayest learn by the very examples, at one time he punished Pharaoh,
at another time He brought a flood of water upon the earth, and that
utter destruction, and again at another time a flood of fire: and even
now we see in many instances the wicked suffering vengeance, and
punishments, which things are figures of Hell.

<span id="v.iv.iii-p19"></span>For lest we should slumber and be
slothful, and forget His word, He awakens our minds by deeds; showing
us, even here, courts of justice, judgment seats, and trials. Is there
then among men so great a regard for justice, and doth God, whose
ordinance even these things are, make no account of it? Is this
credible? In a house, in a market-place, there is a court of justice.
The master daily sits in judgment upon his slaves, calls them to account
for their offenses, punishes some and pardons others. In the country,
the husbandman and his wife are daily at law. In a ship, the master is
judge, and in a camp the general over his soldiers, and everywhere one
may see judicial proceedings. In trades, the master judges the learner.
In short all, publicly and privately, are judges to one another. In
nothing is the consideration of justice overlooked, and all in every
place give account of their actions. And is the inquisition for justice
here thus spread through cities, through houses, and among individuals;
and is there no regard for what is justice there, where “the right hand
of God is full of righteousness” ([Ps. xlviii.
10](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#010)<span id="v.iv.iii-p19.1"></span>..md),
and “His righteousness is as the mountains of God”? ([Ps. xxxvi.
6](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#006)<span id="v.iv.iii-p19.2"></span>..md)

<span id="v.iv.iii-p20"></span>How is it then that God, “the righteous
Judge, strong and patient” ([Ps. vii.
11](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#011.md)<span id="v.iv.iii-p20.1"></span>,
Sept.), bears thus with men, and does not exact punishment? Here thou
hast the cause, He is longsuffering, and thereby would lead thee to
repentance. But if thou continuest in sin, thou “after thy hardness and
impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath.” ([Rom. ii.
5](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#005)<span id="v.iv.iii-p20.2"></span>..md)
If then He is just, He repays according to desert, and does not overlook
those who suffer wrongfully, but avenges them. For this is the part of
one who is just. If He is powerful, He requites after death, and at the
Resurrection: for this belongs to him who is powerful. And if because He
is longsuffering He bears with men, let us not be disturbed, nor ask,
why He does not prosecute vengeance here? For if this were done, the
whole human race before this would have been swept away, if every day He
should call us to account for our transgressions, since there is not,
there is not indeed, a single day pure from sin, but in something
greater or less we offend; so that we should not one of us have arrived
at our twentieth year, but for His great long-suffering, and His
goodness, that grants us a longer space for repentance, that we may put
off our past transgressions.

<span id="v.iv.iii-p21"></span>Let each therefore, with an upright
conscience, entering into a review of what he has done, and bringing his
whole life before him, consider, whether he is not deserving of
chastisements and punishments without number? And when he is indignant
that some one, who has been guilty of many bad actions, escapes with
impunity; let him consider his own faults, and his indignation will
cease. For those crimes appear great, because they are in great and
notorious matters; but if he will enquire into his own, he will perhaps
find them more numerous. For to rob and to defraud is the same thing,
whether it be done for gold or silver; since both proceed from the same
mind. He that will steal a little would not refuse to steal much, if it
fell in his way; and that it does not, is not his own choice, but an
accidental circumstance. A poor man, who robs a poorer, would not
hesitate to rob the rich if he could. His forbearance arises from
weakness, and not from choice. Such an one, you say, is a ruler; and
takes away the property of those who are under his rule. And say, dost
not thou steal? For tell me not that he steals talents, and you as
many <span id="fr_1352"></span>[1353](#fn_1352.md) pence. In giving alms,
some cast in gold, while the widow threw in two mites, yet she
contributed not less than they. Wherefore? Because the intention is
considered, and not the amount of the gift. And then, in the case of
alms, thou wilt have God judge thus, and wouldest, because of thy
poverty, receive no less a reward for giving two mites than he who lays
down many talents of gold? and is not the same rule applicable to
wrongful dealings? How is this consistent? As she who contributed two
mites was considered equal to the greatest givers, because of her good
intention, so thou, who <span id="page_487">p. 487</span> <span
id="v.iv.iii-Page_487"></span>stealest two mites, art as culpable as
those mightier robbers. Nay, if I may give utterance to something
strange, thou art a worse robber than they. For a man would be equally
an adulterer, whether he committed the sin with the wife of a king, or
of a poor man, or of a slave: since the offense is not judged by the
quality of the persons, but by the wickedness of his will who commits
it; so is it likewise in this case. Nay, I should call him who committed
the sin with an inferior perhaps more guilty, than him who intrigued
with the queen herself. For in this case, wealth, and beauty, and other
attractions might be pleaded, none of which exist in the other.
Therefore the other is the worse adulterer. Again, he seems to me a more
determined drunkard, who commits that excess with bad wine; so he is a
worse defrauder, who does not despise small thefts; for he who commits
great robberies, would perhaps not stoop to petty thefts, whereas he who
steals little things would never forbear greater, therefore he is the
greater thief of the two. For how should he despise gold, who does not
despise silver? So that when we accuse our rulers, let us recount our
own faults, and we shall find ourselves more given to wrong and robbery
than they; unless we judge of right and wrong rather by the act, than by
the intention of the mind, as we ought to judge. If one should be
convicted of having stolen the goods of a poor man, another those of a
rich man, will they not both be punished alike? Is not a man equally a
murderer, whether he murder a poor and deformed, or a rich and handsome,
man? When therefore we say that such an one has seized upon another
person’s land, let us reflect upon our own faults, and then we shall not
condemn other men, but we shall admire the longsuffering of God. We
shall not be indignant that judgment does not fall upon them, but we
shall be more slow to commit wickedness ourselves. For when we perceive
ourselves liable to the same punishment, we shall no longer feel such
discontent, and shall desist from offenses, and shall obtain the good
things to come, through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus
Christ, to whom with the Father, &c.
