<span id="v.iii.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c10"><span
id="v.iii.ix-p1.1"></span>Homily VIII.</span>

<span id="v.iii.ix-p2"></span><span id="v.iii.ix-p2.1"></span><span
class="c1"><span id="v.iii.ix-p2.2"></span>[1 Timothy ii.
8-10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#008.md)<span
id="v.iii.ix-p2.3"></span></span>

<span id="v.iii.ix-p3"></span>“I will therefore that men pray
everywhere, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting. In like
manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with
shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broidered hair, or gold, or
pearls, or costly array; but (which becometh women professing godliness)
with good works.”

<span id="v.iii.ix-p4"></span>“<span class="c16"><span
id="v.iii.ix-p4.1"></span>When</span> thou prayest,” saith Christ, “thou
shalt not be as the hypocrites are; for they love to pray standing in
the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen
of men. Verily I say unto you, they have their reward. But thou, when
thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door,
pray to thy Father, which is in secret; and thy Father, which seeth in
secret, shall reward thee openly.” ([Matt.
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#005.md),
[6](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#006)<span id="v.iii.ix-p4.2"></span>..md)
What then says Paul? “I will therefore that men pray everywhere, lifting
up holy hands, without wrath and doubting.” This is not contrary to the
other, God forbid, but quite in harmony with it. But how, and in what
way? We must first consider what means, “enter into thy closet,” and why
Christ commands this, if we are to pray in every place? or whether we
may not pray in the church, nor in any other part of the house, but the
closet? What then means that saying? Christ is recommending us to avoid
ostentation, when He bids us offer our prayers not only privately, but
secretly. For, when He says, “Let not thy left hand know what thy right
hand doeth” ([Matt. vi. 3](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#003.md)<span
id="v.iii.ix-p4.3"></span>.), it is not the hands that He considers, but
He is bidding them use the utmost caution against ostentation: and He is
doing the like here; He did not limit prayer to one place, but required
one thing alone, the absence of vainglory. The object of Paul is to
distinguish the Christian from the Jewish prayers, therefore observe
what he says: “In every place lifting up holy hands,” which was not
permitted the Jews, for they were not allowed to approach God, to
sacrifice and perform their services, elsewhere, but assembling from all
parts of the world in one place, they were bound to perform all their
worship <span id="fr_1183"></span>[1184](#fn_1183.md) in the temple. In
opposition to this he introduces his precept, and freeing them from this
necessity, he says in effect, Our ways are not like the Jewish; for as
Christ commanded us to pray for all men because He died for all men, and
I preach these things for all men, so it is good to “pray everywhere.”
Henceforth the consider<span id="page_433">p. 433</span> <span
id="v.iii.ix-Page_433"></span>ation is not of the place but of the
manner of the prayer; “pray everywhere,” but “everywhere lift up holy
hands.” That is the thing required. And what is “holy”? <span
id="fr_1184"></span>[1185](#fn_1184.md) Pure. And what is pure? Not washed
with water, but free from covetousness, murder, rapacity, violence,
“without wrath and doubting.” What means this? Who is angry when he
prays? It means, without bearing malice. Let the mind of him that prays
be pure, freed from all passion. Let no one approach God in enmity, or
in an unamiable temper, or with “doubting.” What is “without doubting”?
Let us hear. It implies that we should have no misgiving but that we
shall be heard. For it is said, “whatever ye ask believing ye shall
receive.” ([Matt. xxi. 22](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#022.md)<span
id="v.iii.ix-p6.1"></span>.) And again, “when ye stand praying forgive,
if ye have aught against any one.” ([Mark xi.
25](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#025)<span id="v.iii.ix-p6.2"></span>..md)
This is to pray without wrath and doubting. But how can I believe that I
shall obtain my request? By asking nothing opposed to that which He is
ready to grant, nothing unworthy of the great King, nothing worldly, but
all spiritual blessings; if you approach Him “without wrath,” having
pure hands, “holy hands”: hands employed in almsgiving are holy.
Approach Him thus, and you will certainly obtain your request. “For if
ye being evil know how to give good gifts to your children, how much
more shall your Father which is in Heaven give good things to them that
ask Him?” ([Matt. vii. 11](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#011.md)<span
id="v.iii.ix-p6.3"></span>.) By doubting he means misgiving. In like
manner he says, I will that women approach God without wrath and
doubting, lifting up holy hands: that they should not follow their own
desires, nor be covetous or rapacious. For what if a woman does not rob
or steal herself, but does it through means of her husband? Paul however
requires something more of women, that they adorn themselves “in modest
apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broidered hair or
gold or pearls or costly array; But (which becometh women professing
godliness) with good works.” But what is this “modest apparel”? Such
attire as covers them completely, and decently, not with superfluous
ornaments, for the one is becoming, the other is not.

<span id="v.iii.ix-p7"></span><span class="c13"><span
id="v.iii.ix-p7.1"></span>Moral</span>. What? Dost thou approach God to
pray, with broidered hair and ornaments of gold? Art thou come to a
dance? to a marriage? to a gay procession? There such a broidery, such
costly garments, had been seasonable, here not one of them is wanted.
Thou art come to pray, to supplicate for pardon of thy sins, to plead
for thine offenses, beseeching the Lord, and hoping to render Him
propitious to thee. Why dost thou adorn thyself? This is not the dress
of a suppliant. How canst thou groan? How canst thou weep? How pray with
fervency, when thus attired? Shouldest thou weep, thy tears will be the
ridicule of the beholders. She that weeps ought not to be wearing gold.
It were but acting, and hypocrisy. For is it not acting to pour forth
tears from a soul so overgrown with extravagance and ambition? Away with
such hypocrisy! God is not mocked! This is the attire of actors and
dancers, that live upon the stage. Nothing of this sort becomes a modest
woman, who should be adorned “with shamefacedness and sobriety.”

<span id="v.iii.ix-p8"></span>Imitate not therefore the courtesans. For
by such a dress they allure their many lovers; and hence many have
incurred a disgraceful suspicion, and, instead of gaining any advantage
from their ornaments, have injured many <span
id="fr_1185"></span>[1186](#fn_1185.md) by bearing this character. For as
the adulteress, though she may have a character for modesty, derives no
benefit from that character, in the Day, when He who judges the secrets
of men shall make all things manifest; so the modest woman, if she
contrive by this dress to pass for an adulteress, will lose the
advantage of her chastity. For many have suffered harm by this opinion.
“What can I do,” thou sayest, “if another suspects me?” But thou givest
the occasion by thy dress, thy looks, thy gestures. It is for this
reason that Paul discourses much of dress and much of modesty. And if he
would remove those things which are only the indications of wealth, as
gold, and pearls, and costly array; how much more those things which
imply studied ornament, as painting, coloring the eyes, a mincing gait,
the affected voice, a languishing and wanton look; the exquisite care in
putting on the cloak and bodice, the nicely wrought girdle, and the
closely-fitted shoes? For he glances at all these things, in speaking of
“modest apparel” and “shamefacedness.” For such things are shameless and
indecent.

<span id="v.iii.ix-p10"></span>Bear with me, I beseech you, for it is
not my aim by this plain reproof to wound or pain you, but to remove
from my flock all that is unbecoming to them. But if these prohibitions
are addressed to those who have husbands, who are rich, and live
luxuriously; much more to those who have professed virginity. But what
virgin, you say, wears gold, or broidered hair? Yet there may be such a
studied nicety in a simple dress, as that these are nothing to it. You
may study appearance in a common garment more than those who wear gold.
For when a very dark colored robe is drawn closely round the breast with
the girdle (as dancers on the stage are attired), with such nicety that
it may neither <span id="page_434">p. 434</span> <span
id="v.iii.ix-Page_434"></span>spread into breadth nor shrink into
scantiness, but be between both; and when the bosom is set off with many
folds, is not this more alluring than any silken robes? and when the
shoe, shining through its blackness, ends in a sharp point, and imitates
the elegance of painting, so that even the breadth of the sole is scarce
visible—or when, though you do not indeed paint the face, you spend much
time and pains on washing it, and spread a veil across the
forehead, <span id="fr_1186"></span>[1187](#fn_1186.md) whiter than the
face itself—and above that put on a hood, <span
id="fr_1187"></span>[1188](#fn_1187.md) of which the blackness may set off
the white by contrast—is there not in all this the vanity of dress? What
can one say to the perpetual rolling of the eyes? to the putting on of
the stomacher; so artfully as sometimes to conceal, sometimes to
disclose, the fastening? For this too they sometimes expose, so as to
show the exquisiteness of the cincture, winding the hood entirely round
the head. Then like the players, they wear gloves so closely fitted,
that they seem to grow upon the hands: and we might speak of their walk,
and other artifices more alluring than any ornament of gold. Let us
fear, beloved, lest we also hear what the Prophet said to the Hebrew
women who were so studious of outward ornament; “Instead of a girdle,
thou shalt be girded with a halter, instead of well-set hair, baldness.”
([Isa. iii. 24](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#024.md)<span
id="v.iii.ix-p12.1"></span>, Sept.) These things and many others,
invented only to be seen and to attract beholders, are more alluring
than golden ornaments. These are no trifling faults, but displeasing to
God, and enough to mar all the self-denial of virginity.

<span id="v.iii.ix-p13"></span>Thou hast Christ for thy Bridegroom, O
virgin, why dost thou seek to attract human lovers? He will judge thee
as an adulteress. Why dost thou not wear the ornament that is pleasing
to Him; modesty, chastity, orderliness, and sober apparel? This is
meretricious, and disgraceful. We can no longer distinguish harlots and
virgins, to such indecency have they advanced. A virgin’s dress should
not be studied, but plain, and without labor; but now they have many
artifices to make their dress conspicuous. O woman, cease from this
folly. Transfer this care to thy soul, to the inward adorning. For the
outward ornament that invests thee, suffers not that within to become
beautiful. He that is concerned for that which is without, despises that
which is within, even as he that is unconcerned about the exterior,
bestows all his care upon the interior. Say not, “Alas! I wear a
threadbare garment, mean shoes, a worthless veil; what is there of
ornament in these?” Do not deceive thyself. It is impossible, as I said,
to study appearance more by these than by costlier dresses; especially
when they are close-fitted to the body, fashioned to an immodest show,
and of shining neatness. <span id="fr_1188"></span>[1189](#fn_1188.md) Thou
excusest thyself to me, but what canst thou say to God, who knows the
heart and the spirit with which thou doest these things? “It is not done
for fornication!” Perhaps not, but for admiration; and dost thou not
blush for shame to be admired for such things? But thou sayest, “It is
but chance I am so dressed, and for no motive of this kind.” God knoweth
what thou sayest to me: is it to me thou must give account? Nay, it is
to Him who is present at thy actions, and will one day inquire into
them, to whom all things are naked and open. It is on this account that
we now urge these things, that we may not let you be amenable to those
severe judgments. Let us fear, therefore, lest He reprove you in the
words of the Prophet to the Jewish women. “They come to be seen of me
wantoning and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their
feet.” ([Isa. iii. 16](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#016.md)<span
id="v.iii.ix-p14.1"></span>.)

<span id="v.iii.ix-p15"></span>Ye have taken upon you a great contest,
where wrestling, not ornament is required; where the battle awaits you,
not sloth and ease. Observe the combatants and wrestlers in the games.
Do they concern themselves about their walk or their dress? No, but
scorning all these, and throwing about them a garment <span
id="fr_1189"></span>[1190](#fn_1189.md) dripping with oil, they look only
to one thing, to wound, and not be wounded. The devil stands grinding
his teeth, watching to destroy thee every way, and thou remainest
unconcerned, or concerned only about this satanic ornament. I say
nothing about the voice, though much affectation is shown in this also,
nor about perfumes, and other such luxuries. It is for these things we
are ridiculed by the women of the world. The respect for virginity is
lost. No one honors a virgin as she ought to be honored. They have given
occasion to their own dishonor. Ought not they to be looked up to in the
Church of God, as women coming from heaven? but now they are despised,
and deservedly, though not those among them who are discreet. But when
one who has a husband and children, and presides over a household, sees
thee, who ought to be crucified to the world, more devoted to the world
than herself, will she not ridicule and despise thee? See what care!
what pains! In thy humble dress, thou exceedest her who wears the
costliest ornament, and art more studious of appearance than she who is
arrayed in gold. What is becoming to thee thou seekest not; that which
misbecomes thee thou pursuest, when thou oughtest to be occupied in good
works. On this account virgins are less honored than women of the world.
For they do not perform <span id="page_435">p. 435</span> <span
id="v.iii.ix-Page_435"></span>works worthy of their virgin profession.
This is not said to all; or rather it is said to all; to those who are
in fault, that they may learn modesty; to those who are free from blame,
that they may teach modesty to others. But beware lest this rebuke be
verified in deed. For we have not said these things that we may grieve,
but that we may correct you, that we may glory in you. And may we all do
those things which are acceptable to God, and live to His glory, that we
may obtain the blessings promised by the grace and lovingkindness of our
Lord Jesus Christ, with whom, &c.
