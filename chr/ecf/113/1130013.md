<span id="iii.iv.i-p7"></span>————————————

<span id="iii.iv.i-p8"></span><span class="c10"><span
id="iii.iv.i-p8.1"></span>The Argument.</span>

<span id="iii.iv.i-p9"></span><span class="c13"><span
id="iii.iv.i-p9.1"></span>Ephesus</span> is the metropolis of Asia. It
was dedicated to Diana, whom especially they worshipped there as their
great goddess. Indeed so great was the superstition of her worshippers,
that when her temple was burnt, they would not so much as divulge the
name of the man who burnt it.

<span id="iii.iv.i-p10"></span>The blessed John the Evangelist spent the
chief part of his time there: he was there when he was banished, <span
id="fr_166"></span>[167](#fn_166) and there he died. It was there too
that Paul left Timothy, as he says in writing to him, “As I exhorted
thee to tarry at Ephesus.” ([1 Tim. i.
3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#003)<span id="iii.iv.i-p11.4"></span>.)

<span id="iii.iv.i-p12"></span>Most of the philosophers also, those more
particularly who flourished in Asia, were there; and even Pythagoras
himself is said to have come from thence; perhaps because Samos, whence
he really came, is an island of Ionia. <span
id="fr_167"></span>[168](#fn_167) It was the resort also of the
disciples of Parmenides, and Zeno, and Democritus, and you may see a
number of philosophers there even to the present day.

<span id="iii.iv.i-p14"></span>These facts I mention, not merely as
such, but with a view of showing that Paul would needs take great pains
and trouble in writing to these Ephesians. He is said indeed to have
entrusted them, as being persons already well-instructed, with his
profoundest conceptions; and the Epistle itself is full of sublime
thoughts and doctrines. <span id="fr_168"></span>[169](#fn_168)

<span id="iii.iv.i-p16"></span>He wrote the Epistle from Rome, and, as
he himself informs us, in bonds. “Pray for me, that utterance may be
given unto me, in opening my mouth to make known with boldness the
mystery of the Gospel, for which I am an ambassador in chains.” ([Eph.
vi. 19](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#019)<span
id="iii.iv.i-p16.1"></span>.) It abounds with sentiments of overwhelming
loftiness and grandeur. Thoughts which he scarcely so much as utters any
where else, he here plainly declares; as when he says, “To the intent
that now unto the principalities and the powers in the heavenly places
might be made known through the Church the manifold wisdom of God.”
([Eph. iii. 10](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#010)<span
id="iii.iv.i-p16.2"></span>.) And again; “He raised us up with him, and
made us to sit with him in heavenly places.” ([Eph. ii.
6](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#006)<span id="iii.iv.i-p16.3"></span>.)
And again; “Which in other generations was not made known unto the sons
of men, as it hath now been revealed unto His holy apostles and prophets
in the Spirit, that the Gentiles are fellow-heirs, and fellow-partakers
of the promise in Christ.” ([Eph. iii.
5](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#005)<span id="iii.iv.i-p16.4"></span>.)

<span id="iii.iv.i-p11"></span> \[The Apocalypse already implies that he
stood at the head of the churches of Asia Minor. [Rev.
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#004),

This is confirmed by the unanimous testimony of antiquity. The most
probable view is that he was exiled to Patmos under Nero, wrote the
Apocalypse soon after Nero’s death, 68 or 69 <span class="c16"><span
id="iii.iv.i-p11.2"></span>a.d.</span>, returned to Ephesus and died
there after 98 <span class="c16"><span
