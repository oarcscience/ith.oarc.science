<span id="iv.iii.ii-p3"></span>“Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ
Jesus, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi,
fellow-Bishops <span id="fr_520"></span>[521](#fn_520.md) and Deacons:
Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus
Christ.”

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p5"></span><span class="c13"><span
id="iv.iii.ii-p5.1"></span>Here</span>, as writing to those of equal
honor, he does not set down his rank of Teacher, but another, and that a
great one. And what is that? He calls himself a “servant,” and not an
Apostle. For great truly is this rank too, and the sum of all good
things, to be a servant of Christ, and not merely to be called so. “The
servant of Christ,” this is truly a free man in respect to sin, and
being a genuine servant, he is not a servant to any other, since he
would not be Christ’s servant, but by halves. And in again writing to
the Romans also, he says, “Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ.” ([Rom. i.
1](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#001)<span id="iv.iii.ii-p5.2"></span>..md)
But writing to the Corinthians and to Timothy he calls himself an
“Apostle.” On what account then is this? Not because they were superior
to Timothy. Far from it. But rather he honors them, and shows them
attention, beyond all others to whom he wrote. For he also bears witness
to great virtue in them. For besides, there indeed he was about to order
many things, and therefore assumed his rank as an Apostle. But here he
gives them no injunctions but such as they could perceive of themselves.

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p6"></span>“To the saints in Christ Jesus which are
at Philippi.” Since it was likely that the Jews too would call
themselves “saints” from the first oracle, when <span
id="fr_521"></span>[522](#fn_521.md) they were called a “holy people, a
people for God’s own possession” ([Exod.
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#006.md), [Deut.
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#006.md)<span id="iv.iii.ii-p7.1"></span>,
etc.); for this reason he added, “to the saints in Christ Jesus.” For
these alone are holy, and those hence-forward profane. “To the
fellow-Bishops <span id="fr_522"></span>[523](#fn_522.md) and Deacons.”
What is this? were there several Bishops of one city? Certainly not; but
he called the Presbyters so. For then they still interchanged the
titles, and the Bishop was called a Deacon. <span
id="fr_523"></span>[524](#fn_523.md) For this cause in writing to Timothy,
he said, “Fulfil thy ministry,” when he was a Bishop. For that he was a
Bishop appears by his saying to him, “Lay hands hastily on no man.” ([1
Tim. v. 22](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#022.md)<span
id="iv.iii.ii-p9.1"></span>.) And again, “Which was given thee with the
laying on of the hands of the Presbytery.” ([1 Tim. iv.
14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#014)<span id="iv.iii.ii-p9.2"></span>..md)
Yet Presbyters would not have laid hands on a Bishop. And again, in
writing to Titus, he says, “For this cause I left thee in Crete, that
thou shouldest appoint elders <span id="fr_524"></span>[525](#fn_524.md) in
every city, as I gave thee charge. If any man is blameless, the husband
of one wife” ([Titus 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#005.md),
[6](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#006.md)<span
id="iv.iii.ii-p10.1"></span>.); which he says of the Bishop. <span
id="fr_525"></span>[526](#fn_525.md) And after saying this, he adds
immediately, “For the Bishop must be blameless, as God’s steward, not
self willed.” ([Tit. i. 7](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#007.md)<span
id="iv.iii.ii-p11.2"></span>.) So then, as I said, both the Presbyters
were of old called Bishops and Deacons of Christ, and the Bishops
Presbyters; and hence even now many Bishops write, “To my
fellow-Presbyter,” and, “To my fellow-Deacon.” But otherwise the
specific name is distinctly appropriated to each, the Bishop and the
Presbyter. “To the fellow-Bishops,” he says, “and Deacons,

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p12"></span>[Philip.
1.2](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#002.md)<span id="iv.iii.ii-p12.1"></span>.
“Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.”

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p13"></span>How is it that though he nowhere else
writes to the Clergy, not in Rome, nor in Corinth, nor in Ephesus, nor
anywhere, but in general, to “all the saints, the believers, the
beloved,” yet here he writes to the Clergy? Because it was they that
sent, and bare fruit, and it was they that dispatched Epaphroditus to
him.

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p14"></span>[Philip.
1.3](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#003.md)<span id="iv.iii.ii-p14.1"></span>.
“I thank my God,” he says, “upon all my remembrance of you.”

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p15"></span>He said in another of his writings,
“Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit to them: for they
watch in behalf of your souls, as they that shall give account; that
they may do this with joy, and not with grief.” ([Heb. xiii.
17](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#017)<span id="iv.iii.ii-p15.1"></span>..md)
If then the “grief” be due to the wickedness of the disciples, the doing
it “with joy” would be due to their advancement. As often as I remember
you, I glorify God. But this he does from his being conscious of many
good things in them. I both glorify, he says, and pray. I do not,
be<span id="page_185">p. 185</span> <span
id="iv.iii.ii-Page_185"></span>cause ye have advanced unto virtue, cease
praying for you. But “I thank my God,” he says, “upon all my remembrance
of you,”

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p16"></span>[Philip.
1.4](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#004.md)<span id="iv.iii.ii-p16.1"></span>.
“Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request also with
joy.”

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p17"></span>“Always,” <span
id="fr_526"></span>[527](#fn_526.md) not only while I am praying. “With
joy.” For it is possible to do this with grief too, as when he says
elsewhere, “For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto
you with many tears.” ([2 Cor. ii.
4](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#004)<span id="iv.iii.ii-p18.1"></span>..md)

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p19"></span>[Philip.
1.5](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#005.md)<span id="iv.iii.ii-p19.1"></span>.
“For your fellowship in furtherance of the Gospel from the first day
even until now.”

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p20"></span>Great is that he here witnesseth of
them, and very great, and what one might have witnessed of Apostles and
Evangelists. Ye did not, because ye were entrusted with one city, he
saith, care for that only, but ye leave nothing undone to be sharers of
my labors, being everywhere at hand and working with me, and taking part
in my preaching. It is not once, or the second, or third time, but
always, from the time ye believed until now, ye have assumed the
readiness of Apostles. Behold how those indeed that were in Rome turned
away from him; <span id="fr_527"></span>[528](#fn_527.md) for hear him
saying, “This thou knowest, that all that are in Asia turned away from
me.” ([2 Tim. i. 15](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#015.md)<span
id="iv.iii.ii-p21.1"></span>.) And again, “Demas forsook me”: and “at my
first defence no one took my part.” ([2 Tim.
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#010.md),
[16](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#016.md)<span
id="iv.iii.ii-p21.2"></span>.) But these, although absent, shared in his
tribulations, both sending men to him, and ministering to him according
to their ability, and leaving out nothing at all. And this ye do not now
only, saith he, but always, in every way assisting me. So then it is a
“fellowship in furtherance of the Gospel.” For when one preacheth, and
thou waitest on the preacher, thou sharest his crowns. Since even in the
contests that are without, the crown is not only for him that striveth,
but for the trainer, and the attendant, and all that help to prepare the
athlete. For they that strengthen him, and recover him, may fairly
participate in his victory. And in wars too, not only he that wins the
prize of valor, but all they too that attend him, may fairly claim a
share in the trophies, and partake of the glory, as having shared in his
conflict by their attendance on him. For it availeth not a little to
wait on saints, but very much. For it makes us sharers in the rewards
that are laid up for them. Thus; suppose some one hath given up great
possessions for God, continually devotes himself to God, practices great
virtue, and even to words, and even to thoughts, and even in everything
observes extreme strictness. It is open to thee too, even without
showing such strictness, to have a share in the rewards that are laid up
for him for these things. How? If thou aid him both in word and deed. If
thou encourage him both by supplying his needs, and by doing him every
possible service. For then the smoother of that rugged path will be
thyself. So then if ye admire those in the deserts that have adopted the
angelic life, those in the churches that practice the same virtues with
them; if ye admire, and are grieved that ye are far behind them; ye may,
in another way, share with them, by waiting on them, and aiding them.
For indeed this too is of God’s lovingkindness, to bring those that are
less zealous, <span id="fr_528"></span>[529](#fn_528.md) and are not able
to undertake the hard and rugged and strict life, to bring, I say, even
those, by another way, into the same rank with the others. And this Paul
means by “fellowship.” They give a share to us, he means, in carnal
things, and we give a share to them in spiritual things. For if God for
little and worthless things granteth the kingdom, His servants too, for
little and material things, give a share in spiritual things: or rather
it is He that giveth both the one and the other by means of them. Thou
canst not fast, nor be alone, nor lie on the ground, nor watch all
night? Yet mayest thou gain the reward of all these things, if thou go
about the matter another way, by attending on him that laboreth in them,
and refreshing and anointing him constantly, and lightening the pains of
these works. He, for his part, stands fighting and taking blows. Do thou
wait on him when he returns from the combat, receive him in thy arms,
wipe off the sweat, and refresh him; comfort, soothe, restore his
wearied soul. If we will but minister to the saints with such readiness,
we shall be partakers of their rewards. This Christ also tells us. “Make
to yourselves friends by means of the mammon of unrighteousness, that
they may receive you into their eternal tabernacles.” ([Luke xvi.
9](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#009)<span id="iv.iii.ii-p22.1"></span>..md)
Seest thou that they are become sharers? “From the first day,” he says,
“even until now.” And “I rejoice” not only for what is past, but also
for the future; for from the past I guess that too.

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p23"></span>[Philip.
1.6](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#006.md)<span id="iv.iii.ii-p23.1"></span>.
“Being confident of this very thing, that He which began a good work in
you will perfect it until the day of Jesus Christ.”

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p24"></span>See how he also teaches them to be
unassuming. For since he had witnessed a great thing of them, that they
may not feel as men are apt to do, he presently teaches them to refer
both the past and the future to Christ. How? By saying, not, “Being
confident that as ye began ye will also finish,” but what? “He which
began a good work in you will perfect it.” He did not rob them of the
achievement, (for he said, “I <span id="page_186">p. 186</span> <span
id="iv.iii.ii-Page_186"></span>rejoice for your fellowship,” clearly as
if making it their act,) nor did he call their good deeds solely their
own, but primarily of God. “For I am confident,” saith he, “that He
which began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Jesus
Christ.” That is, God will. And it is not about yourselves, he implies,
but about those descending from you that I feel thus. And indeed it is
no small praise, that God should work in one. For if He is “no respecter
of persons,” as indeed He is none, but is looking to our purpose <span
id="fr_529"></span>[530](#fn_529.md) when He aids us in good deeds, it is
evident that we are agents in drawing Him to us; so that even in this
view he did not rob them of their praise. Since if His in working were
indiscriminate, there would have been nothing to hinder but that even
Heathens and all men might have Him working in them, that is, if He
moved us like logs and stones, and required not our part. So that in
saying “God will perfect it,” this also again is made their praise, who
have drawn to them the grace of God, so that He aids them in going
beyond human nature. And in another way also a praise, as that “such are
your good deeds that they cannot be of man, but require the divine
impulse.” But if God will perfect, then neither shall there be much
labor, but it is right to be of good courage, for that they shall easily
accomplish all, as being assisted by Him.

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p26"></span>[Philip.
1.7](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#007.md)<span id="iv.iii.ii-p26.1"></span>.
“Even as it is right for me to be thus minded on behalf of you all,
because I have you in my heart, inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the
defence and confirmation of the Gospel, ye all are partakers with me of
grace.”

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p27"></span>Greatly still does he show here his
longing desire, in that he had them in his heart; and in the very
prison, and though bound, he remembered the Philippians. And it is not a
little to the praise of these men, since it is not of prejudice that
this Saint conceived his love, but of judgment, and right reasons. So
that to be loved of Paul so earnestly is a proof of one’s being
something great and admirable. “And in the defense,” <span
id="fr_530"></span>[531](#fn_530.md) he says, “and confirmation of the
Gospel.” And what wonder if he had them when in prison, since not even
at the moment of going before the tribunal to make my defense, he says,
did ye slip from my memory. For so imperial a thing is spiritual love,
that it gives way to no season, but ever keeps hold of the soul of him
who loves, and allows no trouble or pain to overcome that soul. For as
in the case of the Babylonian furnace, when so vast a flame was raised,
it was a dew to those blessed Children. So too does friendship occupying
the soul of one who loves, and who pleases God, shake off every flame,
and produce a marvelous dew.

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p29"></span>“And in the confirmation of the Gospel,”
he says. So then his bonds were a confirmation of the Gospel, and a
defense. And most truly so. How? For if he had shunned bonds, he might
have been thought a deceiver; but he that endures every thing, both
bonds and affliction, shows that he suffers this for no human reason,
but for God, who rewards. For no one would have been willing to die, or
to incur such great risks, no one would have chosen to come into
collision with such a king, <span id="fr_531"></span>[532](#fn_531.md) I
mean Nero, unless he looked to another far greater King. Truly a
“confirmation of the Gospel” were his bonds. See how he more than
succeeded in turning all things to their opposite. For what they
supposed to be a weakness and a detraction, that he calls a
confirmation; and had this not taken place, there had been a weakness.
Then he shows that his love was not of prejudice, but of judgment. Why?
I have you (in my heart), he says, in my bonds, and in my defense,
because of your being “partakers of my grace.” What is this? Was this
the “grace” of the Apostle, to be bound, to be driven about, to suffer
ten thousand evils? Yes. For He says, “My grace is sufficient for thee,
for my power is made perfect in weakness.” ([2 Cor. xii.
9](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#009)<span id="iv.iii.ii-p30.2"></span>..md)
“Wherefore,” saith he, “I take pleasure in weaknesses, in injuries.”
Since then I see you in your actions giving proof of your virtue, and
being partakers of this grace, and that with readiness, I reasonably
suppose thus much. For I that have had trial of you, and more than any
have known you, and your good deeds; how that even when so distant from
us, ye strive not to be wanting to us in our troubles, but to partake in
our trials for the Gospel’s sake, and to take no less share than myself,
who am engaged in the combat, far off as ye are; am doing but justice in
witnessing to these things.

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p31"></span>And why did he not say “partakers,” but
“partakers with me” <span id="fr_532"></span>[533](#fn_532.md) ? I myself
too, he means, share with another, that I may be a partaker of the
Gospel; that is, that I may share in the good things laid up for the
Gospel. <span id="fr_533"></span>[534](#fn_533.md) And the wonder indeed is
that they were all so minded; for he says that “ye all are
fellow-partakers of grace.” From these beginnings, then, I am confident
that such ye will be even to the end. For it cannot be that so bright a
commencement should be quenched, and fail, but it points to <span
id="fr_534"></span>[535](#fn_534.md) great results.

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p35"></span><span id="page_187">p. 187</span> <span
id="iv.iii.ii-Page_187"></span>Since then it is possible also in other
ways <span id="fr_535"></span>[536](#fn_535.md) to partake of grace, and of
trials, and of tribulations, let us also, I beseech you, be partakers.
How many of those who stand here, yea, rather all, would fain share with
Paul in the good things to come! It is in your power if ye are willing,
on behalf of those who have succeeded to his ministry, when they suffer
any hardship for Christ’s sake, to take their part and succor them. Hast
thou seen thy brother in trial? Hold out a hand! Hast thou seen thy
teacher in conflict? Stand by him! But, says one, there is no one like
Paul! now for disdain! now for criticism! So there is no one like Paul?
Well, I grant it. But, “He that receiveth,” saith He, “a prophet in the
name of a prophet, shall receive a prophet’s reward.” ([Matt. x.
41](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#041)<span id="iv.iii.ii-p36.1"></span>..md)
For was it for this that these were honored, that they coöperated with
*Paul?* Not for this, but because they coöperated with one who had
undertaken the preaching. Paul was honorable for this, that he suffered
these things for Christ’s sake.

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p37"></span>There is indeed no one like Paul. No,
not even but a little approaching to that blessed one. But the preaching
is the same as it was then.

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p38"></span>And not only in his bonds did they have
fellowship with him, but also from the beginning. For hear him saying,
“And ye yourselves also know, ye Philippians, that in the beginning of
the Gospel, no Church had fellowship with me in the matter of giving and
receiving, but ye only.” ([Philip. iv.
15](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#015)<span id="iv.iii.ii-p38.1"></span>..md)
And even apart from trials, the teacher has much labor, watching,
toiling in the word, teaching, complaints, accusations, imputations,
envyings. Is this a little matter, to bear ten thousand tongues, when
one might have but one’s own anxieties? Alas! what shall I do? for I am
in a strait between two things. I long to urge you on and encourage you
to the alliance and succor of the saints of God; but I fear lest some
one should suspect another thing, that I say this not for your sakes,
but for theirs. But know that it is not for their sakes I say these
things, but for your own. And if ye are willing to attend, I convince
you by my very words; the gain is not equal to you and to them. For ye,
if ye give, will give those things from which, willing or unwilling, ye
must soon after part, and give place to others; but what thou receivest
is great and far more abundant. Or, are ye not so disposed, that in
giving ye will receive? For if ye are not so disposed, I do not even
wish you to give. So far am I from making a speech for them! Except one
have first so disposed himself, as receiving rather than giving, as
gaining ten thousand fold, as benefited rather than a benefactor, let
him not give. If as one granting a favor to the receiver, let him not
give. For this is not so much my care, that the saints may be supported.
For even if thou give not, another will give. So that what I want is
this, that you may have a relief from your own sins. But he that gives
not so will have no relief. For it is not giving that is doing alms, but
the doing it with readiness; the rejoicing, the feeling grateful to him
that receives. For, “not grudgingly,” saith he, “or of necessity; for
God loveth a cheerful giver.” ([2 Cor. ix.
7](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#007)<span id="iv.iii.ii-p38.2"></span>..md)
Except then one so give, let him not give: for that is loss, not alms.
If then ye know that ye will gain, not they, know that your gain becomes
greater. <span id="fr_536"></span>[537](#fn_536.md) For as for them the
body is fed, but your soul is approved; for them, not one of their sins
is forgiven when they receive, but for you, the more part of your
offenses is removed. Let us then share with them in their great
prizes. <span id="fr_537"></span>[538](#fn_537.md) When men adopt kings
they do not think they give more than they receive. Adopt thou Christ,
and thou shalt have great security. Wilt thou also share with Paul? Why
do I say Paul when it is Christ that receiveth?

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p41"></span>But that ye may know that all is for
your sakes that I say and do, and not of care for the comfort of others,
if there is any of the rulers of the church that lives in abundance and
wants nothing, though he be a saint, give not, but prefer to him one
that is in want, though he be not so admirable. And wherefore? Because
Christ too so willeth, as when He saith, “If thou make a supper or a
dinner, call not thy friends, neither thy kinsmen, but the maimed, the
lame, the blind, that cannot recompense thee.” ([Luke xiv.
12](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#012)<span id="iv.iii.ii-p41.1"></span>..md)
For it is not indiscriminately that one should pay such attentions, but
to the hungry, but to the thirsty, but to those who need clothing, but
to strangers, but to those who from riches have been reduced to
poverty. <span id="fr_538"></span>[539](#fn_538.md) For He said not simply,
“I was fed,” but “I was an hungered,” for, “Ye saw me an hungered,” He
says, “and fed me.” ([Matt. xxv.
35](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#035)<span id="iv.iii.ii-p42.2"></span>..md)
Twofold is the claim, both that he is a saint and that he is hungry. For
if he that is simply hungry ought to be fed, much more when he is a
saint too that is hungry. If then he is a saint, but not in need, give
not; for this were no gain. For neither did Christ enjoin it; or rather,
neither is he a saint <span id="fr_539"></span>[540](#fn_539.md) that is in
abundance and receiveth. Seest thou that it is not for filthy lucre that
these things have been said to you, but for your profit? Feed the
hungry, that thou mayest not <span id="page_188">p. 188</span> <span
id="iv.iii.ii-Page_188"></span>feed the fire of hell. He, eating of what
is thine, sanctifies also what remains. ([Luke xi.
41](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#041)<span id="iv.iii.ii-p43.2"></span>..md)
Think how the widow maintained Elias; and she did not more feed than she
was fed: she did not more give than receive. This now also takes place
in a much greater thing. For it is not a “barrel of meal,” nor “a cruse
of oil” ([1 Kings xvii. 14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#014.md)<span
id="iv.iii.ii-p43.3"></span>.), but what? “An hundred fold, and eternal
life” ([Matt. 19:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#021.md),
[29](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#029.md)<span
id="iv.iii.ii-p43.4"></span>.), is the recompense for such—the mercy of
God thou becomest; the spiritual food; a pure leaven. She was a widow,
famine was pressing, and none of these things hindered her. Children too
she had, and not even so was she withheld. ([1 Kings xvii.
12](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#012)<span id="iv.iii.ii-p43.5"></span>..md)
This woman is become equal to her that cast in the two mites. She said
not to herself, “What shall I receive from this man? He stands in need
of me. If he had any power he had not hungered, he had broken the
drought, he had not been subject to like sufferings. Perchance he too
offends God.” None of these things did she think of. Seest thou how
great a good it is to do well with simplicity, and not to be over
curious about the person benefited? If she had chosen to be curious she
would have doubted; she would not have believed. So, too, Abraham, if he
had chosen to be curious, would not have received angels. For it cannot,
indeed it cannot be, that one who is exceeding nice in these matters,
should ever meet with them. No, such an one usually lights on impostors;
and how that is, I will tell you. The pious man is not desirous to
appear pious, and does not clothe himself in show, and is likely to be
rejected. But the impostor, as he makes a business of it, puts on a deal
of piety that is hard to see through. So that while he who does good,
even to those who seem not pious, will fall in with those who are so, he
who seeks out those who are thought to be pious, will often fall in with
those who are not so. Wherefore, I beseech you, let us do all things in
simplicity. For let us even suppose that he is an impostor that comes;
you are not bidden to be curious about this. For, “Give,” saith he, “to
every one that asketh thee” ([Luke vi.
30](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#030.md)<span
id="iv.iii.ii-p43.6"></span>.); and, “Forbear not to redeem him that is
to be slain.” ([Prov. xxiv. 11](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#011.md)<span
id="iv.iii.ii-p43.7"></span>.) Yet most of those that are slain suffer
this for some evil they are convicted of; still he saith, “Forbear not.”
For in this shall we be like God, thus shall we be admired, and shall
obtain those immortal blessings, which may we all be thought worthy of,
through the grace and lovingkindness of Jesus Christ our Lord, with
whom, to the Father, together with the Holy Spirit, be glory, power,
honor, now and forever, and world without end. Amen.
