<span id="ii-p1"></span><span class="c10"><span id="ii-p1.1"></span>St.
Chrysostom as a Homilist.</span>

<span id="ii-p2"></span><span class="c1"><span id="ii-p2.1"></span>By
the American Editor of the Homilies on Philippians, Colossians, and
Thessalonians.</span>

<span id="ii-p3"></span>————————————

<span id="ii-p4"></span><span class="c13"><span
id="ii-p4.1"></span>These</span> Homilies are often less complete in
exposition than those on earlier books of the New Testament, and in
literary excellence will not compare with the Homilies on the Statues,
and many other discourses given at Antioch. But to the student of
preaching, they are quite as instructive, if not really more so. Here at
Constantinople the great preacher was burdened with administrative
details, and harassed by Court intrigues, so that his sermons were often
given with far less than his earlier careful preparation, and seem to
have been generally left afterwards to the mercy of shorthand reporters,
and of editors who sent them forth when he was in banishment or in the
grave. Any minister who has winced to see an unwritten sermon or other
address of his own in the morning paper, with the accumulated and
interlaced mistakes of reporter, compositor, and proof-corrector, can
sympathize with the situation. But in fact the preacher thus appears in
undress, and his methods may be in some respects the subject of a more
profitable inspection. You see the sermon in about as imperfect, and
sometimes distorted, a condition as it is seen in the actual delivery by
many of the congregation. You see the frequent questions, the abrupt
turns of phrase, the multiplied repetitions, by which a skilled and
sympathetic preacher, keenly watching his audience, strives to retain
attention and to insure a more general comprehension. You are drawn near
to him, and almost stand by his side.

<span id="ii-p5"></span>John of the Golden Mouth is, upon the whole, our
very best example,—most richly instructive and fruitfully inspiring,—in
respect of expository preaching, which is of late beginning to be more
highly valued and more frequently attempted in our country than ever
before. We have many good models in Scotland, some in England, and a few
at home. Nor should the student ever forget Luther, or fail to profit by
the peculiar methods of some recent Germans; but one who is reasonably
endowed with historical sympathy can learn most from Chrysostom. The
study of an ancient preacher is in this respect like the study of the
Greek and Latin classics, that it demands sympathy with ideas and
persons far away from ourselves, thus broadening the intellect,
invigorating the imagination, and deepening in us a true feeling for all
that is human. One who is at first without interest in Chrysostom,
perhaps even repelled by the extravagant expressions, the heaped-up
imagery, the frequent bad taste (at least, according to our standards),
of this eminently representative Asiatic Greek, is precisely the man
that ought to read Chrysostom, if he wishes to educate himself in the
broadest and highest sense. Study the great preacher till you can
thoroughly appreciate and heartily enjoy him. This will be much aided,
of course, by reading a biography, as that by Stephens, or the long
article in Smith’s Dictionary of Christian Biography, or the
introductory biographical sketch in the ninth volume of this series. You
very soon find that he is profoundly in earnest, and all alive.
Christianity is with him a living reality. He dwells always in its
presence and companionship. We may discern what seem to us grave errors
of doctrinal opinion, but we feel the quickening pulses of genuine
Christian love and zeal. And how fully he sympathizes with his hearers!
He thoroughly knows them, ardently loves them, has <span id="page_vi">p.
vi</span> <span id="ii-Page_vi"></span>a like temperament, shares not a
little in the faults of his age and his race, as must always be the case
with a truly inspiring orator or poet. Even when severely rebuking, when
blazing with indignation, he never seems alien, never stands aloof, but
throws himself among them, in a very transport of desire to check, and
rescue, and save. Is there, indeed, any preacher, ancient or modern, who
in these respects equals John Chrysostom?

<span id="ii-p6"></span>His homilies are not directly a model for us, as
regards the construction of discourse. The early Christians disliked to
hear, or make, a smoothly symmetrical and elegantly finished oration
like those of the secular orators. They wished for familiar and free
addresses, such as we call a prayer-meeting *talk*; and this was
precisely the meaning of their words “homily” and “sermon.” The preacher
took up his passage of Scripture—usually somewhat extended—in a familiar
way, sentence by sentence, with explanations and remarks, as he saw
occasion; sometimes we find Chrysostom actually returning to go over the
passage again, that it may suggest further remarks. At length, he would
be apt to seize upon some topic of doctrine or practice which the text
had directly or remotely suggested, and discuss that by way of
conclusion, not infrequently wandering far off into the thoughts which
one after another occurred. Now, modern taste requires much more system
and symmetry in building a discourse. The Schoolmen taught their pupils
to analyze and arrange, <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md) and modern
preaching has taken the corresponding form, for good and for ill. An
expository sermon of to-day must be much more systematic in its
explanations, and much more regular in its entire construction, than
those of the ancient preachers. Admirable models in this direction are
furnished in Scotland. But while conforming to modern taste as to
structure, one may learn much, very much, from the preachers of the
early centuries, especially from Chrysostom, in respect of freedom,
versatility, and skill in practical application. The modern careful
preparation and orderly arrangement, combined (*mutatis mutandis*) with
the ancient freedom and directness, and reduced to harmony and vital
symmetry by zealous practice, might constitute the best type of
expository preaching.

<span id="ii-p8"></span>And it may be repeated that Chrysostom is not
least helpful in these expository talks on the shorter epistles of Paul.
Though often appearing fragmentary, they lay bare his habitual processes
and reveal his most vigorous powers, and are not wanting in passages
that burst into passion or shine in splendor.

<span id="ii-p9"></span>Their value is increased rather than lessened
for thoughtful readers by the restoration of the true text. The Oxford
translation of the Homilies on these Epistles was published (1843)
before the appearance of the corresponding volume of Field’s critical
edition of the Greek text (1855). The translation was based, for
Philippians, on the edition of Chrysostom’s Works by the English scholar
Savile (1612), with some comparison of the Benedictine edition by
Montfaucon (1718), and the Paris or Second Benedictine edition
(1834–1839); and for Colossians and Thessalonians, on the Paris edition,
with comparison of Savile. There was also occasional use of some
collations from one <span class="c16"><span
id="ii-p9.1"></span>ms.</span> for Philippians, and one or two more for
Thessalonians. Field has pointed out that the Benedictine and the Paris,
and other editions, including that of Migne (1863), really followed,
with slight alteration, the text of Savile. But the earliest edition of
Chrysostom’s Homilies on the Epistles of Paul, published at Verona in
1529, presents a very different text; and Field’s careful study of
collations from four <span class="c16"><span
id="ii-p9.2"></span>mss.</span> for Philippians, six for Colossians, and
five for Thessalonians, together with the Catena, satisfied him that the
Verona edition had in general given the true text, and he has reproduced
it, with such alterations as the <span class="c16"><span
id="ii-p9.3"></span>mss.</span> generally agreeing with it appeared, in
his judgment, to require. The American editor was at first inclined to
think that Field had been unduly influenced by the Catena, which would
naturally abridge its extracts, particularly in drawing from an author
so efflorescent and repetitious as Chrysostom, and which had often
appeared to do so when he was studying it throughout the Gospel of
Matthew. But after going through Philippians with the construction of a
composite text, which was felt to be <span id="page_vii">p. vii</span>
<span id="ii-Page_vii"></span>inconsistent and unsatisfactory, like that
of the Oxford translator and that of Migne, the editor was not far
advanced in Colossians before he saw clearly that the Verona text as
rewrought by Field was, beyond question, generally correct and greatly
to be preferred. Accordingly the whole of this portion, Philippians as
well as the rest, has been conformed to Field’s text, except in
occasional passages, where Field’s own <span class="c16"><span
id="ii-p9.4"></span>mss.</span> were thought to indicate otherwise, and
these have been pointed out in the foot-notes if they possessed the
least importance. The foot-notes also present some few specimens of the
numerous enlargements and explanatory changes or transitional additions
by which the altered text printed by Savile and his followers sought to
piece out and smooth into literary propriety the rough, fragmentary, and
sometimes obscure expressions of the true text. <span
id="fr_1"></span>[2](#fn_1.md) It was only when nearly all this work had
been done that the editor observed that some other portions of the
Oxford translation were originally based on Field’s text, which for
those portions had appeared in time for the purpose. Thus his part of
the work has in fact become assimilated to the American edition for
Matthew, and for Acts and Romans.

<span id="ii-p11"></span>The *translation* of the Oxford edition shows
general excellence, and frequent felicity of English expression. Besides
the numerous cases of differences in text, the translation has been
altered where the syntax seemed to be misunderstood, where the passion
for variety of rendering (as often in the common or authorized English
version of the Bible) had obscured the verbal connection of passages,
&c. It is possible that the American editor, in his love for
Chrysostom’s freedom and downrightness, has sometimes gone to the
opposite extreme from that of the translators in England, and become too
baldly literal.

<span id="ii-p12"></span>The foot-notes in square brackets are from the
editor. The others are from the Oxford translators, being retained
except where they were superseded by the change of text or of
translation, or for some other reason appeared to be no longer useful.
Their references to other volumes of the Oxford edition have been
conformed in the paging to the American edition for Matthew, Acts, and
Romans, and the Statues; elsewhere the pages were simply omitted.—J.A.B.

id="ii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="ii-p7"></span> How this came about, the editor has sought to
explain in his “Lectures on the History of Preaching” (New York,
Armstrong), p. 103 f.

<span id="fn_1"></span>[vii:2](1130001.htm#fr_1.md) <span
id="ii-p9.5"></span>

<span id="ii-p10"></span> Persons interested in text-criticism may care
to know that Field’s volume for the Homilies on these Epistles, with a
digest of various readings, would strikingly illustrate for them, in
different material, the scientific principles and methods of Westcott
and Hort. In the Homilies on Colossians they will find (out of six <span
class="c16"><span id="ii-p10.1"></span>mss.</span> collated for Field,
viz., A B C D E H), a well-marked and singularly uniform group of three,
viz., B C H, presenting the peculiarities of the altered text, adopted
in many passages by Savile and followers, but in many others not
adopted. The “internal evidence of groups,” as described by Westcott and
Hort in vol. ii., Schaff’s Companion to the Bible, or Warfield’s Textual
Criticism, may be here applied with great ease and assured results. In
Thessalonians (out of five <span class="c16"><span
id="ii-p10.2"></span>mss.</span>, B C I K L) B and C are the same
documents as before, but C here presents marked differences of text. B
K, with or without one or two other <span class="c16"><span
id="ii-p10.3"></span>mss.</span>, will be found very generally wrong,
with the peculiarities of the altered text. C sometimes joins them, but
oftener stands aloof, frequently uniting with I or L in giving the true
text, and sometimes standing alone for the right. In Philippians (out of
four <span class="c16"><span id="ii-p10.4"></span>mss.</span>, C E F G)
C G will quite frequently give the altered text, but there is not such
uniformity as in the Homilies on the other Epistles. It may be added
that (as Field also remarks) the alterations throughout the Homilies on
these Epistles show a marked family likeness, and doubtless came from
the same early critical editor, who, however, altered much more freely
in some Homilies (as on Philippians) than in others (as on 2 Thess.).
The altered text sometimes places Chrysostom among the supporters of a
“Syrian” reading of the New Testament, where his real text is not so,
but the instances observed in these Homilies are not so numerous as to
affect his general position. It is to be hoped that other <span
class="c16"><span id="ii-p10.5"></span>mss.</span> of Chrysostom will be
collated, and more complete materials be at hand for future critics to
settle details now remaining uncertain, and perhaps to throw light on
the origin of the altered or Savilian text; but the superiority of the
Verona type, as given by Field, is not at all likely to be ever again
otherwise than clear and assured.
