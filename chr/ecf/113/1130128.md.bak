<span id="v.v.v-p1"></span> <span class="c10"><span
id="v.v.v-p1.1"></span>Homily V.</span>

<span id="v.v.v-p2"></span><span id="v.v.v-p2.1"></span><span
class="c1"><span id="v.v.v-p2.2"></span>[Titus ii.
11-14](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#011.md)<span
id="v.v.v-p2.3"></span></span>

<span id="v.v.v-p3"></span>“For the grace of God that bringeth salvation
hath appeared unto all men, Teaching them that, denying ungodliness and
worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this
present world; Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing
of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ; who gave Himself for us,
that He might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto Himself a
peculiar people, zealous of good works.”

<span id="v.v.v-p4"></span><span class="c13"><span
id="v.v.v-p4.1"></span>Having</span> demanded from servants so great
virtue, for it is great virtue to adorn the doctrine of our God and
Saviour in all things, and charged them to give no occasion of offense
to their masters, even in common matters, he adds the just cause, why
servants should be such: “For the grace of God, that bringeth salvation,
hath appeared.” Those who have God for their Teacher, <span
id="fr_1492"></span>[1493](#fn_1492.md) may well be such as I have
described, seeing their numberless sins have been forgiven to them. For
you know that in addition to other considerations, this in no common
degree awes and humbles the soul, that when it had innumerable sins to
answer for, it received not punishment, but obtained pardon, and
infinite favors. For if one, whose servant had committed many offenses,
instead of scourging him with thongs, should grant him a pardon for all
those, but should require an account of his future conduct, and bid him
beware of falling into the same faults again, and should bestow high
favors upon <span id="page_536">p. 536</span> <span
id="v.v.v-Page_536"></span>him, who do you think would not be overcome
at hearing of such kindness? But do not think that grace stops at the
pardon of former sins—it secures us against them in future, for this
also is of grace. Since if He were never to punish those who still do
amiss, this would not be so much grace, as encouragement to evil and
wickedness.

<span id="v.v.v-p6"></span>“For the grace of God,” he says, “hath
appeared, teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we
should live soberly, righteously, and godly in the present world;
looking for the blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great
God and our Saviour Jesus Christ.” See, how together with the rewards he
places the virtue. And this is of grace, to deliver us from worldly
things, and to lead us to Heaven. He speaks here of two appearings; for
there are two; the first of grace, the second of retribution and
justice.

<span id="v.v.v-p7"></span>“That denying ungodliness,” he says, “and
worldly lusts.”

<span id="v.v.v-p8"></span>See here the foundation of all virtue. He has
not said “avoiding,” but “denying.” Denying implies the greatest
distance, the greatest hatred and aversion. With as much resolution and
zeal as they turned from idols, with so much let them turn from vice
itself, and worldly lusts. For these too are idols, that is, worldly
lusts, and covetousness, and this he names idolatry. Whatever things are
useful for the present life are worldly lusts, <span
id="fr_1493"></span>[1494](#fn_1493.md) whatever things perish with the
present life are worldly lusts. Let us then have nothing to do with
these. Christ came, “that we should deny ungodliness.” <span
id="fr_1494"></span>[1495](#fn_1494.md) Ungodliness relates to doctrines,
worldly lusts to a wicked life.

<span id="v.v.v-p11"></span>“And should live soberly, righteously, and
godly in the present world.”

<span id="v.v.v-p12"></span>Dost thou see, what I always affirm, that it
is not sobriety only to abstain from fornication, but that we must be
free from other passions. So then he who loves wealth is not sober. For
as the fornicator loves women, so the other loves money, and even more
inordinately, for he is not impelled by so strong a passion. And he is
certainly a more powerless <span id="fr_1495"></span>[1496](#fn_1495.md)
charioteer who cannot manage a gentle horse, than he who cannot restrain
a wild and unruly one. What then? says he, is the love of wealth weaker
than the love of women? This is manifest from many reasons. In the first
place, lust springs from the necessity of nature, and what arises from
this necessity must be difficult to restrain, since it is implanted in
our nature. Secondly, because the ancients had no regard for wealth, but
for women they had great regard, in respect of their chastity. And no
one blamed him who cohabited with his wife according to law, even to old
age, but all blamed him who hoarded money. And many of the Heathen
philosophers despised money, but none of them were indifferent to women,
so that this passion is more imperious than the other. But since we are
addressing the Church, let us not take our examples from the Heathens,
but from the Scriptures. This then the blessed Paul places almost in the
rank of a command. “Having food and raiment, let us be therewith
content.” <span id="fr_1496"></span>[1497](#fn_1496.md) ([1 Tim. vi.
8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#008)<span id="v.v.v-p14.2"></span>..md) But
concerning women he says, “Defraud ye not one the other, except it be
with consent”—and “come together again.” ([1 Cor. vii.
5](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#005)<span id="v.v.v-p14.3"></span>..md) And
you see him often laying down rules for a lawful intercourse, and he
permits the enjoyment of this desire, and allows of a second marriage,
and bestows much consideration upon the matter, and never punishes on
account of it. But he everywhere condemns him that is fond of money.
Concerning wealth also Christ often commanded that we should avoid the
corruption of it, but He says nothing about abstaining from a wife. For
hear what He says concerning money; “Whosoever forsaketh not all that he
hath” ([Luke xiv. 33](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#033.md)<span
id="v.v.v-p14.4"></span>.); but he nowhere says, “Whosoever forsaketh
not his wife”; for he knew how imperious that passion is. And the
blessed Paul says, “Marriage is honorable in all, and the bed undefiled”
([Heb. xiii. 4](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#004.md)<span
id="v.v.v-p14.5"></span>.); but he has nowhere said that the care of
riches is honorable, but the reverse. Thus he says to Timothy, “They
that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many
foolish and hurtful lusts.” ([1 Tim. vi.
9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#009)<span id="v.v.v-p14.6"></span>..md) He
says not, they that will be covetous, but, they that will be rich.

<span id="v.v.v-p15"></span>And that you may learn from the common
notions the true state of this matter, it must be set before you
generally. If a man were once for all deprived of money, he would no
longer be tormented with the desire of it, for nothing so much causes
the desire of wealth, as the possession of it. But it is not so with
respect to lust, but many who have been made eunuchs have not been freed
from the flame that burned within them, for the desire resides in other
organs, being seated inwardly in our nature. To what purpose then is
this said? Because the covetous is more intemperate than the fornicator,
inasmuch as the former gives way to a weaker passion. Indeed it proceeds
less from passion than from baseness of mind. But lust is natural, so
that if a man does not approach a woman, nature performs her part and
operation. But there is nothing of this sort in the case of avarice.

<span id="v.v.v-p16"></span><span id="page_537">p. 537</span> <span
id="v.v.v-Page_537"></span>“That we should live godly in this present
world.”

<span id="v.v.v-p17"></span>And what is this hope? what the reward of
our labors?

<span id="v.v.v-p18"></span>“Looking for the blessed hope and the
appearing.”

<span id="v.v.v-p19"></span>For nothing is more blessed and more
desirable than that appearing. Words are not able to represent it, the
blessings thereof surpass our understanding.

<span id="v.v.v-p20"></span>“Looking for the blessed hope and glorious
appearing of our great God and Saviour.” <span
id="fr_1497"></span>[1498](#fn_1497.md)

<span id="v.v.v-p22"></span>Where are those who say that the Son is
inferior to the Father?

<span id="v.v.v-p23"></span>“Our great God and Saviour.” He who saved us
when we were enemies. What will He not do then when He has us
approved? <span id="fr_1498"></span>[1499](#fn_1498.md)

<span id="v.v.v-p25"></span>“The great God.” When he says great with
respect to God, he says it not comparatively but absolutely, <span
id="fr_1499"></span>[1500](#fn_1499.md) after Whom no one is great, since
it is relative. For if it is relative, He is great by comparison, not
great by nature. But now He is incomparably great.

<span id="v.v.v-p27"></span>[Tit.
2.14](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#014.md)<span id="v.v.v-p27.1"></span>.
“Who gave Himself for us, that He might redeem us from all iniquity, and
purify unto Himself a peculiar people.”

<span id="v.v.v-p28"></span>“Peculiar”: that is, selected from the rest,
and having nothing in common with them.

<span id="v.v.v-p29"></span>“Zealous of good works.”

<span id="v.v.v-p30"></span>Dost thou see that our part is necessary,
not merely works, but “zealous”; we should with all alacrity, with a
becoming earnestness, go forward in virtue. For when we were weighed
down with evils, and incurably diseased, it was of His lovingkindness
that we were delivered. But what follows after this is our part as well
as His.

<span id="v.v.v-p31"></span>[Tit.
2.15](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#015.md)<span id="v.v.v-p31.1"></span>.
“These things speak and exhort, and rebuke with all authority.”

<span id="v.v.v-p32"></span>“These things speak and exhort.” Do you see
how he charges Timothy? “Reprove, rebuke, exhort.” But here, “Rebuke
with all authority.” For the manners of this people were more stubborn,
wherefore he orders them to be rebuked more roughly, and with all
authority. For there are some sins, which ought to be prevented by
command. We may with persuasion advise men to despise riches, to be
meek, and the like. But the adulterer, the fornicator, the defrauder,
ought to be brought to a better course by command. And those who are
addicted to augury and divination, and the like, should be corrected
“with all authority.” Observe how he would have him insist on these
things with independence, and with entire freedom. <span
id="fr_1500"></span>[1501](#fn_1500.md)

<span id="v.v.v-p34"></span>“Let no man despise thee.” But

<span id="v.v.v-p35"></span>[Tit.
3.1](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#001.md)<span id="v.v.v-p35.1"></span>.
“Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey
magistrates, to be ready to every good work, to speak evil of no man, to
be no brawlers.”

<span id="v.v.v-p36"></span>What then? even when men do evil, may we not
revile them? nay, but “to be ready to every good work, to speak evil of
no man.” Hear the exhortation, “To speak evil of no man.” Our lips
should be pure from reviling. For if our reproaches are true, it is not
for us to utter them, but for the Judge to enquire into the matter. “For
why,” he says, “dost thou judge thy brother?” ([Rom. xiv.
10](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#010)<span id="v.v.v-p36.1"></span>..md) But
if they are not true, how great the fire. <span
id="fr_1501"></span>[1502](#fn_1501.md) Hear what the thief says to his
fellow-thief. “For we are also in the same condemnation.” ([Luke xxiii.
40](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#040)<span id="v.v.v-p37.2"></span>..md) We
are running the same hazard. <span id="fr_1502"></span>[1503](#fn_1502.md)
If thou revilest others, thou wilt soon fall into the same sins.
Therefore the blessed Paul admonishes us: “Let him that standeth, take
heed lest he fall.” ([1 Cor. x.
12](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#012)<span id="v.v.v-p38.1"></span>..md)

<span id="v.v.v-p39"></span>“To be no brawlers, but gentle, showing all
meekness unto all men.”

<span id="v.v.v-p40"></span>Unto Greeks and Jews, to the wicked and the
evil. For when he says, “Let him that standeth take heed lest he fall,”
he wakens their fears from the future; but here, on the contrary, he
exhorts them from the consideration of the past, and the same in what
follows;

<span id="v.v.v-p41"></span>[Tit.
3.3](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#003.md)<span id="v.v.v-p41.1"></span>.
“For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish.”

<span id="v.v.v-p42"></span>Thus also he does in his Epistle to the
Galatians, where he says, “Even so we, when we were children, were in
bondage under the elements of the world.” ([Gal. iv.
4](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#004)<span id="v.v.v-p42.1"></span>..md)
Therefore he says, Revile no one, for such also thou wast thyself.

<span id="v.v.v-p43"></span>“For we ourselves also were sometimes
foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures,
living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.”

<span id="v.v.v-p44"></span>Therefore we ought to be thus to all, to be
gently disposed. For he who was formerly in such a state, and has been
delivered from it, ought not to reproach others, but to pray, to be
thankful to Him who has granted both to him and them deliverance from
such evils. Let no one boast; for all have sinned. If then, doing well
thyself, thou art inclined to revile others, consider thy own former
life, and the uncertainty of the future, and restrain thy anger. <span
id="fr_1503"></span>[1504](#fn_1503.md) For if thou hast lived virtuously
from thy earliest youth, yet nevertheless thou mayest have many sins;
and if thou hast not, as thou thinkest, consider that this is not the
effect of thy virtue, but of the <span id="page_538">p. 538</span> <span
id="v.v.v-Page_538"></span>grace of God. For if He had not called thy
forefathers, thou wouldest have been disobedient. See here how he
mentions every sort of wickedness. How many things has not God dispensed
by the Prophets and all other means? have we heard?

<span id="v.v.v-p46"></span>“For we,” he says, “were once deceived.”

<span id="v.v.v-p47"></span>[Tit.
3.4](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#004.md)<span id="v.v.v-p47.1"></span>.
“But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man
appeared.” How? “Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but
according to His mercy He saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and
renewing of the Holy Ghost.”

<span id="v.v.v-p48"></span>Strange! How were we drowned <span
id="fr_1504"></span>[1505](#fn_1504.md) in wickedness, so that we could not
be purified, but needed a new birth? For this is implied by
“Regeneration.” For as when a house is in a ruinous state no one places
props under it, nor makes any addition to the old building, but pulls it
down to its foundations, and rebuilds it anew; so in our case, God has
not repaired us, but has made us anew. For this is “the renewing of the
Holy Ghost.” He has made us new men. How? “By His Spirit”; and to show
this further, he adds,

<span id="v.v.v-p50"></span>[Tit.
3.6](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#006.md)<span id="v.v.v-p50.1"></span>.
“Which He shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour.”

<span id="v.v.v-p51"></span>Thus we need the Spirit abundantly.

<span id="v.v.v-p52"></span>“That being justified by His grace”—again by
grace and not by debt—“we may be made heirs according to the hope of
eternal life.”

<span id="v.v.v-p53"></span>At the same time there is an incitement to
humility, and a hope for the future. For if when we were so abandoned,
as to require to be born again, to be saved by grace, to have no good in
us, if then He saved us, much more will He save us in the world to come.

<span id="v.v.v-p54"></span>For nothing was worse than the brutality of
mankind before the coming of Christ. They were all affected towards each
other as if enemies and at war. Fathers slew their own sons, and mothers
were mad against their children. There was no order settled, no natural,
no written law; everything was subverted. There were adulteries
continually, and murders, and things if possible worse than murders, and
thefts; indeed we are told by one of the heathen, that this practice was
esteemed a point of virtue. And naturally, since they worshiped a
god <span id="fr_1505"></span>[1506](#fn_1505.md) of such character. Their
oracles frequently required them to put such and such men to death. Let
me tell you one of the stories of that time. One Androgeus, the son of
Minos, coming to Athens, obtained a victory in wrestling, for which he
was punished and put to death. Apollo therefore, remedying one evil by
another, ordered twice seven youths to be executed on his account. What
could be more savage than this tyrannical command? And it was executed
too. A man undertook to atone the mad rage of the demon, and slew these
young men, because the deceit of the oracle prevailed with them. But
afterwards, when the young men resisted and stood upon their defense, it
was no longer done. If now it had been just, it ought not to have been
prevented, but if unjust, as undoubtedly it was, it ought not to have
been commanded at all. Then they worshiped boxers and wrestlers. They
waged constant wars in perpetual succession, city by city, village by
village, house by house. They were addicted to the love of boys, and one
of their wise men made a law that Pædrasty, as well as anointing for
wrestling, <span id="fr_1506"></span>[1507](#fn_1506.md) should not be
allowed to slaves, as if it was an honorable thing; and they had houses
for this purpose, in which it was openly practiced. And if all that was
done among them was related, it would be seen that they openly outraged
nature, and there was none to restrain them. Then their dramas were
replete with adultery, lewdness, and corruption of every sort. In their
indecent nocturnal assemblies, women were admitted to the spectacle.
There was seen the abomination of a virgin sitting in the theater during
the night, amidst a drunken multitude of young men madly reveling. The
very festival was the darkness, and the abominable deeds practiced by
them. On this account he says, “For we ourselves also were sometimes
foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures.” One
man loved his stepmother, <span id="fr_1507"></span>[1508](#fn_1507.md) a
woman her step-son, and in consequence hung herself. For as to their
passion for boys, whom they called their “Pædica,” it is not fit to be
named. And would you see a son married to his mother? This too happened
among them, and what is horrible, though it was done in ignorance, the
god whom they worshiped did not prevent it, but permitted this outrage
to nature to be committed, and that though she was a person of
distinction. And if those, who, if for no other reason, yet for the sake
of their reputation with the multitude, might have been expected to
adhere to virtue; if they rushed thus headlong into vice, what is it
likely was the conduct of the greater part, who lived in obscurity? What
is more diversified than this pleasure? The wife of a certain one fell
in love with another man, and with the help of her adulterer, slew her
husband upon his return. The greater part of you probably know the
story. The son of the murdered man killed the adulterer, and after him
his mother, then he himself became mad, and was haunted by furies. <span
id="page_539">p. 539</span> <span id="v.v.v-Page_539"></span>After this
the madman himself slew another man, and took his wife. What can be
worse than such calamities as these? But I mention these instances taken
from the Heathens, <span id="fr_1508"></span>[1509](#fn_1508.md) with this
view, that I may convince the Gentiles, what evils then prevailed in the
world. But we may show the same from our own writings. For it is said,
“They sacrificed their sons and daughters unto devils.” ([Ps. cvi.
37](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#037)<span id="v.v.v-p58.1"></span>..md)
Again, the Sodomites were destroyed for no other cause than their
unnatural appetites. Soon after the coming of Christ, did not a king’s
daughter dance at a banquet in the presence of drunken men, and did she
not ask as the reward of her dancing the murder and the head of a
Prophet? “Who can utter the mighty acts of the Lord?” ([Ps. vi.
2](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#002)<span id="v.v.v-p58.2"></span>..md)

<span id="v.v.v-p59"></span>“Hateful,” he says, “and hating one
another.” For it must necessarily happen, when we let loose every
pleasure on the soul, that there should be much hatred. For where love
is, with virtue, no man overreacheth another in any matter. Mark also
what Paul says, “Be not deceived, neither fornicators, nor idolaters,
nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,
nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, shall inherit the kingdom of
God. And such were some of you.” ([1 Cor.
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#009.md),
[10](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#010)<span id="v.v.v-p59.1"></span>..md)
Dost thou see how every species of wickedness prevailed? It was a state
of gross darkness, and the corruption of all that was right. For if
those who had the advantage of prophecies, and who saw so many evils
inflicted upon their enemies, and even upon themselves, nevertheless did
not restrain themselves, but committed numberless foolish crimes, what
would be the case with others? One of their lawgivers ordered that
virgins should wrestle naked in the presence of men. Many blessings on
you! that ye cannot endure the mention of it; but their philosophers
were not ashamed of the actual practice. Another, the chief of their
philosophers, approves of their going out to the war, and of their being
common, <span id="fr_1509"></span>[1510](#fn_1509.md) as if he were a pimp
and pander to their lusts.

<span id="v.v.v-p61"></span>“Living in malice and envy.”

<span id="v.v.v-p62"></span>For if those who professed philosophy among
them made such laws, what shall we say of those who were not
philosophers? If such were the maxims of those who wore a long beard,
and assumed the grave cloak, <span id="fr_1510"></span>[1511](#fn_1510.md)
what can be said of others? Woman was not made for this, O man, to be
prostituted as common. O ye subverters of all decency, who use men, as
if they were women, and lead out women to war, as if they were men! This
is the work of the devil, to subvert and confound all things, to
overleap the boundaries that have been appointed from the beginning, and
remove those which God has set to nature. For God assigned to woman the
care of the house only, to man the conduct of public affairs. But you
reduce the head to the feet, and raise the feet to the head. You suffer
women to bear arms, and are not ashamed. But why do I mention these
things? They introduce on the stage a woman that murders her own
children, nor are they ashamed to stuff the ears of men with such
abominable stories.

<span id="v.v.v-p64"></span>[Tit.
3.4](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#004.md)<span id="v.v.v-p64.1"></span>.
“But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour towards man
appeared, Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but
according to His mercy He saved us by the washing of regeneration, and
renewing of the Holy Ghost, which He shed on us abundantly through Jesus
Christ our Saviour, that being justified by His grace we should be made
heirs according to the hope of eternal life.”

<span id="v.v.v-p65"></span>What means, “according to the hope”? That,
as we have hoped, so we shall enjoy eternal life, or because ye are even
already heirs.

<span id="v.v.v-p66"></span>“This is a faithful saying.”

<span id="v.v.v-p67"></span>Because he had been speaking of things
future and not of the present, therefore he adds, that it is worthy of
credit. These things are true, he says, and this is manifest from what
has gone before. For He who has delivered us from such a state of
iniquity, and from so many evils, will assuredly impart to us the good
things to come, if we abide in grace. For all proceeds from the same
kind concern.

<span id="v.v.v-p68"></span><span class="c13"><span
id="v.v.v-p68.1"></span>Moral.</span> Let us then give thanks to God,
and not revile them; nor accuse them, but rather let us beseech them,
pray for them, counsel and advise them, though they should insult and
spurn us. For such is the nature of those who are diseased. <span
id="fr_1511"></span>[1512](#fn_1511.md) But those who are concerned for the
health of such persons do all things and bear all things, though it may
not avail, that they may not have themselves to accuse of negligence.
Know ye not that often, when a physician despairs of a sick man, some
relative standing by addresses him, “Bestow further attendance, leave
nothing undone, that I may not have to accuse myself, that I may incur
no blame, <span id="fr_1512"></span>[1513](#fn_1512.md) no self-reproach.”
Do you not see the great care that near kinsmen take of their relations,
how much they do for them, both entreating the physicians to cure them,
and sitting perseveringly beside them? Let us at least imitate them. And
yet there is no comparison between the objects of our concern. For if
any <span id="page_540">p. 540</span> <span
id="v.v.v-Page_540"></span>one had a son diseased in his body, he could
not refuse to take a long journey to free him from his disease. But when
the soul is in a bad state, no one concerns himself about it, but we all
are indolent, all careless, all negligent, and overlook our wives, our
children, and ourselves, when attacked <span
id="fr_1513"></span>[1514](#fn_1513.md) by this dangerous disease. But when
it is too late, we become sensible of it. Consider how disgraceful and
absurd it is to say afterwards, “we never looked for it, we never
expected that this would be the event.” And it is no less dangerous than
disgraceful. For if in the present life it is the part of foolish men to
make no provision for the future, much more must it be so with respect
to the next life, when we hear many counseling us, and informing us what
is to be done, and what not to be done. Let us then hold fast that
hope. <span id="fr_1514"></span>[1515](#fn_1514.md) Let us be careful of
our salvation, let us in all things call upon God, that He may stretch
forth His hand to us. How long will you be slothful? How long negligent?
How long shall we be careless of ourselves and of our fellow-servants?
He hath shed richly upon us the grace of His Spirit. Let us therefore
consider how great is the grace he has bestowed upon us, and let us show
as great earnestness ourselves, or, since this is not possible, some,
although it be less. For if after this grace we are insensible, the
heavier will be our punishment. “For if I,” He says, “had not come and
spoken unto them, they had not had sin, but now they have no cloak for
their sin.” ([John xv. 22](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#022.md)<span
id="v.v.v-p72.1"></span>.) But God forbid that this should be said of
us, and grant that we may all be thought worthy of the blessings
promised to those who have loved Him, in Jesus Christ our Lord, &c.

<span id="v.v.v-p21"></span> This is the meaning, as Middleton has
shown. The English Version, “The great God and our Saviour,” is
ambiguous.

<span id="v.v.v-p24"></span> Edd. οὐκ εὐδοκιμοῦντας λαβών. The order
does not admit the sense, “Seeing He received us when not approved,” so
that this would be, “how will he not punish us if he finds us not
approved;” but B. has not the negative, which Downes had rejected.

the case of wrestling, which was practiced by all that were free.

<span id="v.v.v-p57"></span> Downes may be right in taking this of
Phœnix, Il. ix. 452. What follows refers to Hippolytus, of whom
Montfaucon seems to forget that this could not be said.

<span id="v.v.v-p60"></span> This is an unfair view of Plato’s Republic,
against which, however, it is a real objection that it sets aside a law
of nature, though with political, and not sensual views. Some have seen
a great truth allegorized in this, and it may be justly, but ordinary
Greeks would be more likely to take it as St. Chrysostom does, and Plato
perhaps hints that it would be so in practice, b. viii. init.
