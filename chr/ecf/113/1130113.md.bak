<span id="v.iv.i-p9"></span><span id="v.iv.i-p9.1"></span><span
class="c1"><span id="v.iv.i-p9.2"></span>[2 Tim.
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#001.md),
[2](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#002.md)<span
id="v.iv.i-p9.3"></span></span>

<span id="v.iv.i-p10"></span>“Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the
will of God, according to the promise of life which is in Jesus Christ,
to Timothy, my dearly beloved son: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the
Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.”

<span id="v.iv.i-p11"></span><span class="c13"><span
id="v.iv.i-p11.1"></span>What</span> is the reason of his writing this
second Epistle to Timothy? He had said, “I hope to come unto thee
shortly” ([1 Tim. iii. 14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#014.md)<span
id="v.iv.i-p11.2"></span>.), and as this had not taken place, instead of
coming to him, he consoles him by a letter, when he was grieving perhaps
for his absence, and oppressed by the cares of the government, which he
had now taken in hand. For even great men, when they are placed at the
helm, and are charged with the direction of the Church, feel the
strangeness of their position, and are overwhelmed, as it were, by the
waves of business. This was particularly the case when the Gospel was
first preached, when the ground was everywhere unturned, and all was
opposition and hostility. There were, besides, heresies commencing from
the Jewish teachers, as he has shown in his former Epistle. Nor does he
only comfort him by letters, he invites him to come to him: “Do thy
diligence,” he says, “to come shortly unto me,” and, “when thou comest,
bring with thee the books, but especially the parchments.” ([2 Tim.
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#009.md),
[13](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#013)<span id="v.iv.i-p11.3"></span>..md)
And he seems to have written this Epistle when his end was approaching.
For he says, “I am now ready to be offered up”; and again, “At my first
answer no man stood with me.” ([2 Tim.
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#006.md),
[16](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#016)<span id="v.iv.i-p11.4"></span>..md)
To set all this right, he both offers consolation from his own trials,
and also says,

<span id="v.iv.i-p12"></span>“Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the
will of God, according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus.”

<span id="v.iv.i-p13"></span>Thus at the very commencement he raises up
his mind. Tell me not, he says, of the dangers here. These obtain for us
eternal life, where there is no peril, where grief and mourning flee
away. For He hath not made us Apostles only that we might encounter
dangers, but that we might even suffer and die. <span
id="fr_1313"></span>[1314](#fn_1313.md) And as it would not be a
consolation to recount to him his own troubles, but rather an increase
of his grief, he begins immediately with offering comfort, saying,
“According to the promise of life which is in Jesus Christ.” But if it
is a “promise,” seek it not here. For, “hope that is seen is not hope.”
([Rom. viii. 24](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#024.md)<span
id="v.iv.i-p14.1"></span>.)

<span id="v.iv.i-p15"></span>[2 Tim.
1.2](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#002.md)<span id="v.iv.i-p15.1"></span>.
“To Timothy, my dearly beloved son.”

<span id="v.iv.i-p16"></span>Not merely his “son,” but, “dearly
beloved”; since it is possible for sons not to be beloved. <span
id="page_476">p. 476</span> <span id="v.iv.i-Page_476"></span>Not such,
he means, art thou; I call thee not merely a son, but a “dearly beloved
son.” As he calls the Galatians his children, but at the same time
complains of them; “My little children,” he says, “of whom I travail in
birth again.” ([Gal. iv. 19](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#019.md)<span
id="v.iv.i-p16.1"></span>.) And he bears particular testimony to his
virtue by calling him “beloved.” For where love does not arise from
nature, it must arise from the merit of the object. Those who are born
of us, are loved not only on account of their virtue, but from the force
of nature; but when those who are of the faith are beloved, it is on
account of nothing but their merit, for what else can it be? And this
especially in the case of Paul, who never acted from partiality. And
further, he shows by calling him his “beloved son,” that it was not
because he was offended with him, or despised him, or condemned him;
that he did not come to him.

<span id="v.iv.i-p17"></span>[2 Tim.
1.2](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#002.md)<span id="v.iv.i-p17.1"></span>.
“Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and Christ Jesus our
Lord.”

<span id="v.iv.i-p18"></span>These things which he before prayed for, he
again invokes upon him. And observe how, at the very beginning, he
excuses himself for not having come to him, nor seen him. For his words,
“Till I come,” and, “Hoping to come to thee shortly,” had led Timothy to
expect his coming soon. For this he excuses himself, but he does not
immediately mention the cause of his not coming, lest he should grieve
him mightily. For he was detained in prison by the emperor. But when at
the end of the Epistle he invited him to come to him, then he informed
him of it. He does not at the outset plunge him into sorrow, but
encourages the hope that he shall see him. “Greatly desiring to see
thee,” and “Do thy diligence to come unto me shortly.” ([2 Tim.
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#004.md), [2 Tim.
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#009)<span id="v.iv.i-p18.1"></span>..md)
Immediately therefore he raises him up, and proceeds to praise him.

<span id="v.iv.i-p19"></span>[2 Tim.
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#003.md),
[4](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#004.md)<span id="v.iv.i-p19.1"></span>. “I
thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience, that
without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day;
greatly desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I might
be filled with joy.”

<span id="v.iv.i-p20"></span>“‘I thank God,’ he says, ‘that I remember
thee,’ so much do I love thee.” This is a mark of excessive love, when a
man glories in his affection from loving so much. “I thank God,” he
says, “Whom I serve”: and how? “With a pure conscience,” for he had not
violated his conscience. And here he speaks of his blameless life, for
he everywhere calls his life his conscience. Or because I never gave up
any good that I purposed, for any human cause, not even when I was a
persecutor. Wherefore he says, “I obtained mercy, because I did it
ignorantly in unbelief” ([1 Tim. i.
13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#013)<span id="v.iv.i-p20.1"></span>..md);
all but saying, “Do not suspect that it was done of wickedness.” He
properly commends his own disposition, that his love may appear sincere.
For what he says is in fact, “I am not false, I do not think one thing
and profess another.” So in the book of Acts we read he was compelled to
praise himself. For when they slandered him as a seditious man and an
innovator, he said in his own defense, “Ananias said to me, The God of
our fathers hath chosen thee that thou shouldest know His will, and see
that Just One, and shouldest hear the voice of His mouth. For thou shalt
be His witness unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard.” ([Acts
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#014.md),
[15](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#015)<span id="v.iv.i-p20.2"></span>..md)
In the same manner here, that he may not, as if he had been forgetful,
have the character of one void of friendship and conscience, he justly
praises himself, saying, that “without ceasing I have remembrance of
thee,” and not simply that, but “in my prayers.” That is, it is the
business of my prayers, that which I constantly continue to perform. For
this he shows by saying, “For this I besought God day and night,
desiring to see thee.” Mark his fervent desire, the intensity <span
id="fr_1314"></span>[1315](#fn_1314.md) of his love. And again, his
humility, how he apologizes to his disciples, and then he shows that it
was not on light or vain grounds; and this he had shown us before, but
again gives proof of it. “Being mindful of thy tears.” It was natural
for Timothy, when parting from him, <span
id="fr_1315"></span>[1316](#fn_1315.md) to mourn and weep, more than a
child torn away from the milk and from the breast of its mother. “That I
may be filled with joy; greatly desiring to see thee.” I would not
willingly have deprived myself of so great a pleasure, though I had been
of an unfeeling and brutal nature, for those tears coming to my
remembrance would have been enough to soften me. But such is not my
character. I am one of those who serve God purely; so that many strong
motives urged me to come to thee. So then he wept. And he mentions
another cause, and that of a consolatory kind.

<span id="v.iv.i-p23"></span>[2 Tim.
1.5](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#005.md)<span id="v.iv.i-p23.1"></span>.
“When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee.”

<span id="v.iv.i-p24"></span>This is another commendation, that Timothy
came not of Gentiles, nor of unbelievers, but of a family that served
Christ from the first. ([Acts 16:1](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#001.md),
[3](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#003)<span id="v.iv.i-p24.1"></span>..md)

<span id="v.iv.i-p25"></span>“Which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois,
and thy mother Eunice.”

<span id="v.iv.i-p26"></span>For Timothy, it says, “was the son of a
certain woman which was a Jewess, and believed.” How a Jewess? how
believing? Because she was not of the Gentiles, “but on account of his
father, who was a Greek, and of the Jews that <span id="page_477">p.
477</span> <span id="v.iv.i-Page_477"></span>were in those quarters, he
took and circumcised him.” Thus, as these mixtures of Jews and Gentiles
took place, the Law began gradually to be dissolved. And mark in how
many ways he shows that he did not despise him. “I serve God,” he says,
“I have a true conscience” for my part, and thou hast thy “tears,” and
not thy tears only, but for “thy faith,” because thou art a laborer for
the Truth, because there is no deceit in thee. As therefore thou showest
thyself worthy of love, being so affectionate, so genuine a disciple of
Christ; and as I am not one of those who are devoid of affection, but of
those who earnestly pursue the Truth; what hindered me from coming to
thee?

<span id="v.iv.i-p27"></span>“And I am persuaded that in thee also.”

<span id="v.iv.i-p28"></span>From the beginning, he means, thou hast had
this excellency. Thou receivedst from thy forefathers the faith
unfeigned. For the praises of our ancestors, when we share in them,
redound also to us. Otherwise they avail nothing, but rather condemn us;
wherefore he has said, “I am persuaded that in thee also.” It is not a
conjecture, he means, it is my persuasion; I am fully assured of it. If
therefore from no human motive thou hast embraced it, nothing will be
able to shake thy faith.

<span id="v.iv.i-p29"></span>[2 Tim.
1.6](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#006.md)<span id="v.iv.i-p29.1"></span>.
“Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God,
which is in thee by the putting on of my hands.”

<span id="v.iv.i-p30"></span>You see how greatly dispirited and dejected
he considers him to be. He almost says, “Think not that I despise thee,
but be assured that I do not condemn thee, nor have I forgotten thee.
Consider, at any rate, thy mother and thy grandmother. It is because I
know that thou hast unfeigned faith that I put thee in remembrance.” For
it requires much zeal to stir up the gift of God. As fire requires fuel,
so grace requires our alacrity, that it may be ever fervent. “I put thee
in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, that is in thee by the
putting on of my hands,” that is, the grace of the Spirit, which thou
hast received, for presiding over the Church, for the working of
miracles, and for every service. For this grace it is in our power to
kindle or to extinguish; wherefore he elsewhere says, “Quench not the
Spirit.” ([1 Thess. v. 19](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#019.md)<span
id="v.iv.i-p30.1"></span>.) For by sloth and carelessness it is
quenched, and by watchfulness and diligence it is kept alive. For it is
in thee indeed, but do thou render it more vehement, that is, fill it
with confidence, with joy and delight. Stand manfully.

<span id="v.iv.i-p31"></span>[2 Tim.
1.7](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#007.md)<span id="v.iv.i-p31.1"></span>.
“For God hath not given us the spirit of fear, but of power, and of
love, and of a sound mind.”

<span id="v.iv.i-p32"></span>That is, we did not receive the Spirit,
that we should shrink from exertion, but that we may speak with
boldness. For to many He gives a spirit of fear, as we read in the wars
of the Kings. “A spirit of fear fell upon them.” ([Ex. xv.
16](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#016)<span id="v.iv.i-p32.1"></span>?.md)
That is, he infused terror into them. But to thee He has given, on the
contrary, a spirit of power, and of love toward Himself. This, then, is
of grace, and yet not merely of grace, but when we have first performed
our own parts. For the Spirit that maketh us cry, “Abba, Father,”
inspires us with love both towards Him, and towards our neighbor, that
we may love one another. For love arises from power, and from not
fearing. For nothing is so apt to dissolve love as fear, and a suspicion
of treachery.

<span id="v.iv.i-p33"></span>“For God hath not given us the spirit of
fear, but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind”: <span
id="fr_1316"></span>[1317](#fn_1316.md) he calls a healthy state of the
soul a sound mind, or it may mean sobriety of mind, or else a sobering
of the mind, that we may be sober-minded, and that if any evil befall
us, it may sober us, and cut off superfluities.

<span id="v.iv.i-p35"></span><span class="c13"><span
id="v.iv.i-p35.1"></span>Moral.</span> Let us then not be distressed at
the evils that happen to us. This is sobriety of mind. “In the season of
temptation,” he says, “make not haste.” ([Ecclesiasticus
2.2](../../../bib/apo/sir002.htm#002)<span id="v.iv.i-p35.2"></span>..md)
Many have their several griefs at home, and we share in each other’s
sorrows, though not in their sources. For one is unhappy on account of
his wife, another on account of his child, or his domestic, another of
his friend, another of his enemy, another of his neighbor, another from
some loss. And various are the causes of sorrow, so that we can find no
one free from trouble and unhappiness of some kind or other, but some
have greater sorrows and some less. Let us not therefore be impatient,
nor think ourselves only to be unhappy.

<span id="v.iv.i-p36"></span>For there is no such thing in this mortal
life as being exempt from sorrow. If not to-day, yet to-morrow; if not
to-morrow, yet some later day trouble comes. For as one cannot sail, I
mean, over a long sea, and not feel disquietude, so it is not possible
to pass through this life, without experience of sorrow, yea though you
name a rich man; for in that he is rich, he hath many occasions of
inordinate desires, <span id="fr_1317"></span>[1318](#fn_1317.md) yea,
though the king himself, since he too is ruled by many, and cannot do
all that he would. Many favors he grants contrary to his wishes, and
more than all men is obliged to do what he would not. How so? Because he
has many about him who wish to receive his gifts. And just think
how <span id="fr_1318"></span>[1319](#fn_1318.md) great is his chagrin,
when he is desirous to effect something, but is unable, either from fear
or suspicion, or hindered by enemies or by friends. Often when he has
succeeded in achieving some end, he loses all the pleasure of it, from
many becoming at enmity <span id="page_478">p. 478</span> <span
id="v.iv.i-Page_478"></span>with him. Again, do you think that they are
free from grief, who live a life of ease? It is impossible. As a man
cannot escape death, so neither can he escape sorrow. How many troubles
must they endure, which we cannot express in words, and which they only
can know by experience! How many have prayed a thousand times to die, in
the midst of their wealth and luxury! For luxury by no means puts men
out of the reach of grief: it is rather the very thing to produce
sorrows, diseases, and uneasiness, often when there is no real ground
for it. For when such is the habit of the soul, it is apt to grieve even
without a cause. Physicians say that from a weak state of the stomach
arise sorrows <span id="fr_1319"></span>[1320](#fn_1319.md) without any
occasion; and does not the like happen to ourselves, to feel uneasy,
without knowing any cause for it? In short, we can find no one who is
exempted from sorrow. And if he has less occasion for grief than
ourselves, yet he thinks otherwise, for he feels his own sorrows, more
than those of other men. As they who suffer pain in any part of their
bodies, think that their sufferings exceed their neighbor’s. He that has
a disease of the eye, thinks there is nothing so painful, and he that
has a disorder in the stomach, considers that the sorest of diseases,
and each thinks that the heaviest of sufferings, with which he is
himself afflicted. So it is with sorrow, each thinks his own present
grief the most severe. For of this he judges by his own experience. He
that is childless considers nothing so sad as to be without children; he
that is poor, and has many children, complains of the extreme evils of a
large family. He who has but one, looks upon this as the greatest
misery, because that one, being set too much store by, and never
corrected, becomes willful, and brings grief upon his father. He who has
a beautiful wife, thinks nothing so bad as having a beautiful wife,
because it is the occasion of jealousy and intrigue. He who has an ugly
one, thinks nothing worse than having a plain wife, because it is
constantly disagreeable. The private man thinks nothing more mean, more
useless, than his mode of life. The soldier declares that nothing is
more toilsome, more perilous, than warfare; that it would he better to
live on bread and water than endure such hardships. He that is in power
thinks there can be no greater burden than to attend to the necessities
of others. He that is subject to that power, thinks nothing more servile
than living at the beck of others. The married man considers nothing
worse than a wife, and the cares of marriage. The unmarried declares
there is nothing so wretched as being unmarried, and wanting the repose
of a home. The merchant thinks the husbandman happy in his security. The
husbandman thinks the merchant so in his wealth. In short, all mankind
are somehow hard to please, and discontented and impatient. When
condemning the whole race, he saith, “Man is a thing of nought” ([Ps.
cxliv. 4](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#004.md)<span
id="v.iv.i-p39.1"></span>.), implying that the whole kind is a wretched
unhappy creature. How many long for old age! How many think youth a
happy time! Thus each different period has its unhappiness. When we find
ourselves censured on account of our youth, we say, why are we not old?
and when our heads are hoary, we ask whither has our youth flown?
Numberless, in short, are the occasions of sorrow. There is one path
only by which this unevenness can be escaped. It is the path of virtue.
Yet that too has its sorrows, only they are sorrows not unprofitable,
but productive of gain and advantage. For if any one has sinned, he
washes away his sin by the compunction that comes of his sorrow. Or, if
he has grieved in sympathizing with a fallen brother, this is not
without its recompense. For sympathy with those that are in misery gives
us great confidence towards God.

<span id="v.iv.i-p40"></span>Hear therefore what philosophy is taught by
the example of Job in holy Scripture! Hear also what Paul saith: “Weep
with them that weep”; and again, “Condescend to men of low estate.”
([Rom. 12:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#015.md),
[16](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#016)<span id="v.iv.i-p40.1"></span>..md)
For, by the communication of sorrow, the extreme burden of it is
lightened. For as in the case of a heavy load, he that bears part of the
weight relieves him who was bearing it alone, so it is in all other
things.

<span id="v.iv.i-p41"></span>But now, when any one of our relatives
dies, there are many who sit by and console us. Nay, we often raise up
even an ass that has fallen; but when the souls of our brethren are
falling, we overlook them and pass by, as if they were of less value
than an ass. And if we see any one entering into a tavern indecently;
nay, if we see him drunk, or guilty of any other unseemly action, we do
not restrain him, we rather join him in it. Whence Paul has said: “They
not only do these things, but have pleasure in them that do them.”
([Rom. i. 32](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#032.md)<span
id="v.iv.i-p41.1"></span>.) The greater part even form
associations <span id="fr_1320"></span>[1321](#fn_1320.md) for the purposes
of drunkenness. But do thou, O man, form associations to restrain the
madness of inebriety. Such friendly doings are beneficial to those who
are in bonds or in affliction. Something of this kind Paul enjoined to
the Corinthians, alluding to which he says, “That there be no gatherings
when I come.” ([1 Cor. xvi. 2](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#002.md)<span
id="v.iv.i-p42.2"></span>.) But now everything is done with a view to
luxury, reveling, and pleasure. We have a common seat, a common table,
we have wine in common, and com<span id="page_479">p. 479</span> <span
id="v.iv.i-Page_479"></span>mon expenses, but we have no community of
alms. Such were the friendly doings in the time of the Apostles; they
brought all their goods into the common stock. Now I do not require you
to bestow all, but some part. “Let each lay by him in store on the first
day of the week, as God has prospered him,” and lay it down as a tribute
for the seven days. In this way give alms, whether more or less. “For
thou shalt not appear before the Lord empty.” ([Ex. xxiii.
15](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#015)<span id="v.iv.i-p42.3"></span>..md)
This was said to the Jews, how much more then to us. For this cause the
poor stand before the doors, that no one may enter empty, but each may
do alms at his entrance. Thou enterest to implore mercy. First show
mercy. He that comes later owes the more. For when we have been first,
he that is second pays down more. <span
id="fr_1321"></span>[1322](#fn_1321.md) Make God thy debtor, and then offer
thy prayers. Lend to Him, and then ask a return, and thou shalt receive
it with usury. God wills this, and does not retract. If thou ask with
alms, He holds himself obliged. If thou ask with alms, thou lendest and
receivest interest. Yes, I beseech you! It is not for stretching out thy
hands thou shalt be heard! stretch forth thy hands, not to heaven, but
to the poor. If thou stretch forth thy hand to the hands of the poor,
thou hast reached the very summit of heaven. For He who sits there
receives thine alms. But if thou liftest them up without a gift, thou
gainest nothing. If the king, arrayed in purple, should come to thee and
ask an alms, wouldest thou not readily give all that thou hast? But now
when thou art entreated through the poor, not by an earthly but a
heavenly King, dost thou stand regardless, and defer thy gift? What
punishment then dost thou not deserve? For the being heard depends not
upon the lifting up of thy hands, nor on the multitude of thy words, but
upon thy works. For hear the prophet, “When ye” spread “forth your
hands, I will hide mine eyes from you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I
will not hear.” ([Isa. i. 15](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#015.md)<span
id="v.iv.i-p43.1"></span>.) For he ought to be silent, who needs mercy,
and not even to look up to heaven; he that hath confidence may say <span
id="fr_1322"></span>[1323](#fn_1322.md) much. But what says the Scripture,
“Judge for the fatherless, plead for the widow, learn to do good.”
([Isa. i. 17](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#017.md)<span
id="v.iv.i-p44.1"></span>.) In this way we shall be heard, though we
lift not up our hands, nor utter a word, nor make request. In these
things then let us be zealous, that we may obtain the promised
blessings, through the grace and lovingkindness, &c.
