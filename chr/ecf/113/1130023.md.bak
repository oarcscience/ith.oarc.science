<span id="iii.iv.xi-p2"></span><span id="iii.iv.xi-p2.1"></span><span
class="c1"><span id="iii.iv.xi-p2.2"></span>[Ephesians iv.

<span id="iii.iv.xi-p3"></span>“There is one body, and one Spirit, even
as ye are called in one hope of your calling.”

<span id="iii.iv.xi-p4"></span><span class="c13"><span
id="iii.iv.xi-p4.1"></span>When</span> the blessed Paul exhorts us to
anything of special importance, so truly wise and spiritual as he is, he
grounds his exhortation upon things in Heaven: this itself being a
lesson he had learned from the Lord. Thus he saith also elsewhere, “Walk
in love, even as Christ also hath loved us.” ([Eph.
5.2](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#002)<span id="iii.iv.xi-p4.2"></span>..md)
And again, “Have this mind in you, which was also in Christ Jesus, who
being in the form of God, counted it not a prize to be on an equality
with God.” ([Phil. 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#005.md),
[6](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#006)<span id="iii.iv.xi-p4.3"></span>..md)
This is what he is doing here also, for whenever the examples he is
setting before us are great, he is intense in his zeal and feeling. What
then does he say, now he is inciting us to unity? “There is one body,
and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling:”

<span id="iii.iv.xi-p5"></span>[Eph.
4.5](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#005.md)<span id="iii.iv.xi-p5.1"></span>.
“One Lord, one faith, one baptism.”

<span id="iii.iv.xi-p6"></span>Now what is this one body? The faithful
throughout the whole world, both which are, and which have been, and
which shall be. And again, they that before Christ’s coming pleased God,
are “one body.” How so? Because they also knew Christ. Whence does this
appear? “Your father Abraham,” saith He, “rejoiced to see My day, and he
saw it, and was glad.” ([John viii.
56](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#056)<span id="iii.iv.xi-p6.1"></span>..md)
And again, “If ye had believed Moses,” He saith, “ye would have believed
Me, for he wrote of Me.” ([John v.
46](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#046)<span id="iii.iv.xi-p6.2"></span>..md)
And the prophets too would not have written of One, of whom they knew
not what they said; whereas they both knew Him, and worshiped Him. Thus
then were they also “one body.”

<span id="iii.iv.xi-p7"></span>The body is not disjoined from the
spirit, for then would it not be a body. Thus it is customary also with
us, touching things which are united, and which have any great
consistency or coherence, to say, they are one body. And thus again,
touching union, we take that to be a body which is under one head. If
there be one head, then is there one body. The body is composed of
members both honorable and dishonorable. Only the greater is not to rise
up even against the meanest, nor this latter to envy the other. They do
not all indeed contribute the same share, but severally according to the
proportion of need. And forasmuch as all are formed for necessary and
for different purposes, all are of equal honor. Some indeed there are,
which are more especially principal members, others less so: for
example, the head is more a principal member than all the rest of the
body, as containing within itself all the senses, and the governing
principle of the soul. And to live without the head is impossible;
whereas many persons have lived for a long time with their feet cut off.
So that it is better than they, not only by its position, but also by
its very vital energy and its function.

<span id="iii.iv.xi-p8"></span>Now why am I saying this? There are great
numbers in the Church; there are those who, like the head, are raised up
to a height; who, like the eyes that are in the head, survey heavenly
things, who stand far aloof from the earth, and have nothing in common
with it, whilst others occupy the rank of feet, and tread upon the
earth; of healthy feet indeed, for to tread upon the earth is no crime
in feet, but to run to evil. “Their feet,” saith the Prophet, “run to
evil.” ([Isa. lix. 7](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#007.md)<span
id="iii.iv.xi-p8.1"></span>.) Neither then let these, the head, saith
he, be high-minded against the feet, nor the feet look with evil eye at
them. For thus the peculiar beauty of each is destroyed, and the
perfectness of its function impeded. And naturally enough; inasmuch as
he who lays snares for his neighbor will be laying snares first of all
for himself. And should the feet therefore not choose to convey the head
anywhere upon its necessary journey, they will at the same time be
injuring themselves by their inactivity and sloth. Or again, should the
head not choose to take any care of the feet, itself will be the first
to sustain the damage. However, those members do not rise up one against
the other; it is not likely, for it has been so ordered by nature that
they should not. But with man, how is it possible for him not to rise up
against man? No one, we know, ever rises up against Angels; since
neither do they rise against the Archangels. Nor, on the other hand, can
the irrational creatures proudly exalt themselves over us; but where the
nature is equal in dignity, and the gift one, and where one has no more
than another, how shall this be prevented?

<span id="iii.iv.xi-p9"></span>And yet surely these are the very reasons
why thou oughtest not to rise up against thy neighbors. For if all
things are common, and one has nothing more than another, whence this
mad folly? We partake of the same nature, partake alike of soul and
body, we breathe the same air, we use the same food. Whence this
rebellious rising of one against another? And yet truly the being able
by one’s virtue to overcome the <span id="page_100">p. 100</span> <span
id="iii.iv.xi-Page_100"></span>incorporeal powers, that were enough to
lead to arrogance; or rather arrogance it would not be, for with good
reason am I high-minded, and exceedingly high-minded against the evil
spirit. And behold even Paul, how high-minded he was against that evil
spirit. For when the evil spirit was speaking great and marvelous things
concerning him, he made him hold his peace, and endured him not even in
his flattery. For when that damsel, “who had the spirit of divination,”
cried, saying, “These men are the servants of the most high God, which
show unto us the way of salvation” ([Acts
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#016.md),
[17](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#017.md)<span
id="iii.iv.xi-p9.1"></span>.), he rebuked him severely, and silenced his
forward tongue. And again he elsewhere writes, and says, “God shall
bruise Satan under your feet shortly.” ([Rom. xvi.
20](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#020)<span id="iii.iv.xi-p9.2"></span>..md)
Will the difference of nature have any effect? Perceivest thou not that
the difference between natures has no effect whatever, but only the
difference of purpose? Because of their principle therefore they are far
worse than all. Well, a man may say, but I am not rising up against an
Angel, because there is so vast a distance between my nature and his.
And yet surely thou oughtest no more to rise up against a man than
against an Angel, for the Angel indeed differs from thee in nature, a
matter which can be neither an honor to him, nor a disgrace to thee:
whereas man differs from man not at all in nature, but in principle; and
there is such a thing as an Angel too even amongst men. So that if thou
rise not up against Angels, much more shouldest thou not against men,
against those who have become angels in this our nature; for should any
one among men become as virtuous as an Angel, that man is in a far
higher degree superior to thee, than an Angel is. And why so? Because
what the one possesses by nature, the other has achieved of his own
purpose. And again, because the Angel has his home far from thee in
distance also, and dwelleth in Heaven; whereas this man is living with
thee, and giving an impulse to thy emulation. And indeed he lives
farther apart from thee than the Angel. For “our citizenship,” saith the
Apostle, “is in Heaven.” ([Philip. iii.
20](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#020)<span id="iii.iv.xi-p9.3"></span>..md)
And to show thee that this man hath his home still farther distant, hear
where his Head is seated; upon the throne, saith he, the royal throne!
And the farther distant that throne is from us, the farther is he also.

<span id="iii.iv.xi-p10"></span>Well, but I see him, thou wilt say, in
the enjoyment of honor, and I am led to jealousy. Why, this is the very
thing which has turned all things upside down, which has filled not the
world only, but the Church also, with countless troubles. And just as
fierce blasts setting in across a calm harbor, render it more dangerous
than any rock, or than any strait whatever; so the lust of glory
entering in, overturns and confounds everything.

<span id="iii.iv.xi-p11"></span>Ye have oftentimes been present at the
burning of large houses. Ye have seen how the smoke keeps rising up to
Heaven; and if no one comes near to put a stop to the mischief, but
every one keeps looking to himself, the flame spreads freely on, and
devours everything. And oftentimes the whole city will stand around;
they will stand round indeed as spectators of the evil, not to aid nor
assist. And there you may see them one and all standing round, and doing
nothing but each individual stretching out his hand, and pointing out to
some one who may be just come to the spot, either a flaming brand that
moment flying through a window, or beams hurled down, or the whole
circuit of the walls forced out, and tumbling violently to the ground.
Many too there are of the more daring and venturesome, who will have the
hardihood even to come close to the very buildings themselves whilst
they are burning, not in order to stretch forth a hand towards them, and
to put a stop to the mischief, but that they may the more fully enjoy
the sight, being able from the nearer place to observe closely all that
which often escapes those at a distance. Then if the house happen to be
large and magnificent, it appears to them a pitiable spectacle, and
deserving of many tears. And truly there is a pitiable spectacle for us
to behold; capitals of columns crumbled to dust, and many columns
themselves shattered to pieces, some consumed by the fire, others thrown
down often by the very hands which erected them, that they may not add
fuel to the flame. Statues again, which stood with so much gracefulness,
with the ceiling resting on them, these you may see all exposed, with
the roof torn off, and themselves standing hideously disfigured in the
open air. And why should one go on to describe the wealth stored up
within? the tissues of gold, and the vessels of silver? And where the
lord of the house and his consort scarcely entered, where was the
treasurehouse of tissues and perfumes, and the caskets of the costly
jewels,—all has become one blazing fire, and within now, are bath-men
and street-cleaners, and runaway slaves, and everybody; and everything
within is one mass of fire and water, of mud, and dust, and half-burnt
beams!

<span id="iii.iv.xi-p12"></span>Now why have I drawn out so full a
picture as this? Not simply because I wish to represent to you the
conflagration of a house, (for what concern is that of mine?) but
because I wish to set before your eyes, as vividly as I can, the
calamities of the Church. For like a conflagration indeed, or like a
thunderbolt hurled from on high, have they lighted upon the roof of the
Church, and yet they rouse up no one; <span id="page_101">p. 101</span>
<span id="iii.iv.xi-Page_101"></span>but whilst our Father’s house is
burning, we are sleeping, as it were, a deep and stupid sleep. And yet
who is there whom this fire does not touch? Which of the statues that
stand in the Church? for the Church is nothing else than a house built
of the souls of us men. Now this house is not of equal honor throughout,
but of the stones which contribute to it, some are bright and shining,
whilst others are smaller and more dull than they, and yet superior
again to others. <span id="fr_276"></span>[277](#fn_276.md) There we may
see many who are in the place of gold also, the gold which adorns the
ceiling. Others again we may see, who give the beauty and gracefulness
produced by statues. Many <span id="fr_277"></span>[278](#fn_277.md) we may
see, standing like pillars. For he is accustomed to call men also
“pillars” ([Gal. ii. 9](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#009.md)<span
id="iii.iv.xi-p14.1"></span>.), not only on account of their strength
but also on account of their beauty, adding as they do, much grace, and
having their heads overlaid with gold. We may see a multitude, forming
generally the wide middle space and the whole extent of the
circumference; for the body at large occupies the place of those stones
of which the outer walls are built. Or rather we must go on to a more
splendid picture yet. This Church, of which I speak, is not built of
these stones, such as we see around us, but of gold and silver, and of
precious stones, and there is abundance of gold dispersed everywhere
throughout it. But, oh the bitter tears this calls forth! For all these
things hath the lawless rule of vainglory consumed; that all-devouring
flame, which no one has yet got under. And we stand gazing in amazement
at the flames, but no longer able to quench the evil: or if we do quench
it for a short time, yet after two or three days as a spark blown up
from a heap of ashes overturns all, and consumes no less than it did
before, so it is here also: for this is just what is wont to happen in
such a conflagration. And as to the cause, it has devoured the supports
of the very pillars of the Church; those of us who supported the roof,
and who formerly held the whole building together it has enveloped in
the flame. Hence too was a ready communication to the rest of the outer
walls: for so also in the case of buildings, when the fire lays hold of
the timbers, it is better armed for its attack upon the stones; but when
it has brought down the pillars and leveled them with the ground,
nothing more is wanted to consume all the rest in the flames. For when
the props and supports of the upper parts fall down, those parts also
themselves will speedily enough follow them. Thus is it also at this
moment with the Church: the fire has laid hold on every part. We seek
the honors that come from man, we burn for glory, and we hearken not to
Job when he saith,

<span id="iii.iv.xi-p15"></span>“If like Adam (or after the manner of
men) I covered my transgressions

<span id="iii.iv.xi-p16"></span>By hiding mine iniquity in my bosom,

<span id="iii.iv.xi-p17"></span>Because I feared the great
multitude.” <span id="fr_278"></span>[279](#fn_278.md)

<span id="iii.iv.xi-p19"></span>Behold ye a virtuous spirit? I was not
ashamed, he saith, to own before the whole multitude my involuntary
sins: And if he was not ashamed to confess, much more were it our duty
to do so. For saith the prophet, “Set thou forth thy cause, that thou
mayest be justified.” ([Isa. xliii.
26](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#026)<span id="iii.iv.xi-p19.1"></span>..md)
Great is the violence of this evil, everything is overturned by it and
annihilated. We have forsaken the Lord, and are become slaves of honor.
We are no longer able to rebuke those who are under our rule, because we
ourselves also are possessed with the same fever as they. We who are
appointed by God to heal others, need the physician ourselves. What
further hope of recovery is there left, when even the very physicians
themselves need the healing hand of others?

<span id="iii.iv.xi-p20"></span>I have not said these things without an
object, nor am I making lamentations to no purpose, but with the view
that one and all, with our women and children, having sprinkled
ourselves with ashes, and girded ourselves about with sackcloth, may
keep a long fast, may beseech God Himself to stretch forth His hand to
us, and to stay the peril. For need is there indeed of His hand, that
mighty, that marvelous hand. Greater things are required of us than of
the Ninevites. “Yet three days,” said the prophet, “and Nineveh shall be
overthrown.” <span id="fr_279"></span>[280](#fn_279.md) ([Jonah iii.
4](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#004)<span id="iii.iv.xi-p21.1"></span>..md)
A fearful message, and burdened with tremendous threat. And how should
it be otherwise? to expect that within three days, the city should
become their tomb, and that all should perish in one common judgment.
For if, when it happens that two children die at the same time in one
house, the hardship becomes intolerable, and if to Job this of all
things seemed the most intolerable, that the roof fell in upon all his
children, and they were thus killed; what must it be to behold not one
house, nor two children, but a nation of a hundred and twenty thousand
buried beneath the ruins!

<span id="iii.iv.xi-p22"></span><span id="page_102">p. 102</span> <span
id="iii.iv.xi-Page_102"></span>Ye know how terrible a disaster is this,
for lately has this very warning happened to us, not that any prophet
uttered a voice, for we are not worthy to hear such a voice, but the
warning crying aloud from on high more distinctly than any
trumpet. <span id="fr_280"></span>[281](#fn_280.md) However, as I was
saying, “Yet three days,” said the prophet, “and Nineveh shall be
overthrown.” A terrible warning indeed, but now we have nothing even
like that; no, there are no longer “three days,” <span
id="fr_281"></span>[282](#fn_281.md) nor is there a Nineveh to be
overthrown, but many days are already past since the Church throughout
all the world has been overthrown, and leveled with the ground, and all
alike are overwhelmed in the evil; nay more, of those that are in high
places the stress is so much the greater. Wonder not therefore if I
should exhort you to do greater things than the Ninevites; and why? nay
more, I do not now proclaim a fast only, but I suggest to you the remedy
which raised up that city also when falling. And what was that? “God saw
their works,” saith the prophet, “that they turned from their evil way,
and God repented of the evil which He said He would do unto them.”
([Jonah iii. 10](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#010.md)<span
id="iii.iv.xi-p24.1"></span>.) This let us do, both we and you. Let us
renounce the passion for riches, the lust for glory, beseeching God to
stretch forth His hand, and to raise up our fallen members. And well may
we, for our fear is not for the same objects as theirs; for then indeed
it was only stones and timbers that were to fall, and bodies that were
to perish; but now it is none of these; no, but souls are about to be
delivered over to hell fire. Let us implore, let us confess unto Him,
let us give thanks unto Him for what is past, let us entreat Him for
what is to come, that we may be counted worthy to be delivered from this
fierce and most terrible monster, and to lift up our thanksgivings to
the loving God and Father with whom, to the Son, together with the Holy
Ghost, be glory, might, and honor, now, henceforth, and for ever and
ever. Amen.
