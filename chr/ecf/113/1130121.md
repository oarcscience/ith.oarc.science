<span id="v.iv.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c10"><span
id="v.iv.ix-p1.1"></span>Homily IX.</span>

<span id="v.iv.ix-p2"></span><span id="v.iv.ix-p2.1"></span><span
class="c1"><span id="v.iv.ix-p2.2"></span>[2 Tim.
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#016.md),
[17](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#017.md)<span
id="v.iv.ix-p2.3"></span></span>

<span id="v.iv.ix-p3"></span>“All Scripture is given by inspiration of
God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for
instruction in righteousness: That the man of God may be perfect,
thoroughly furnished unto all good works.” \[R.V.: Every Scripture
inspired of God is also profitable, &c.\]

<span id="v.iv.ix-p4"></span><span class="c13"><span
id="v.iv.ix-p4.1"></span>Having</span> offered much exhortation and
consolation from other sources, he adds that which is more perfect,
derived from the Scriptures; and he is reasonably full in offering
consolation, because he has a great and sad thing to say. For if Elisha,
ho was with his master to his last breath, when he saw him departing as
it were in death, <span id="fr_1422"></span>[1423](#fn_1422.md) rent his
garments for grief, what think you must this disciple suffer, so loving
and so beloved, upon hearing that his master was about to die, and that
he could not enjoy his company when he was near his death, which is
above all things apt to be distressing? For we are less grateful for the
past time, when we have been deprived of the more recent intercourse of
those who are departed. For this reason when he had previously offered
much consolation, he then discourses concerning his own death: and this
in no ordinary way, but in words adapted to comfort him and fill him
with joy; so as to have it considered as a sacrifice rather than a
death; a migration, as in fact it was, and a removal to a better state.
“For I am now ready to be offered up” ([2 Tim. iv.
6](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#006)<span id="v.iv.ix-p5.1"></span>..md), he
says. For this reason he writes: “All Scripture is given by inspiration
of God, <span id="fr_1423"></span>[1424](#fn_1423.md) and is profitable for
doctrine, <span id="page_510">p. 510</span> <span
id="v.iv.ix-Page_510"></span>for reproof, for correction, for
instruction in righteousness.” All what Scripture? all that sacred
writing, he means, of which I was speaking. This is said of what he was
discoursing of; about which he said, “From a child thou hast known the
holy Scriptures.” All such, then, “is given by inspiration of God”;
therefore, he means, do not doubt; and it is “profitable for doctrine,
for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: that the
man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.”

<span id="v.iv.ix-p7"></span>“For doctrine.” For thence we shall know,
whether we ought to learn or to be ignorant of anything. And thence we
may disprove what is false, thence we may be corrected and brought to a
right mind, may be comforted and consoled, and if anything is deficient,
we may have it added to us.

<span id="v.iv.ix-p8"></span>“That the man of God may be perfect.” For
this is the exhortation of the Scripture given, that the man of God may
be rendered perfect by it; without this therefore he cannot be perfect.
Thou hast the Scriptures, he says, in place of me. If thou wouldest
learn anything, thou mayest learn it from them. And if he thus wrote to
Timothy, who was filled with the Spirit, how much more to us!

<span id="v.iv.ix-p9"></span>“Thoroughly furnished unto all good works”;
not merely taking part in them, he means, but “thoroughly furnished.”

<span id="v.iv.ix-p10"></span>[2 Tim.
4.1](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#001.md)<span id="v.iv.ix-p10.1"></span>.
“I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, Who
shall judge the quick and the dead.”

<span id="v.iv.ix-p11"></span>He either means the wicked and the just,
or the departed and those that are still living; for many will be left
alive. In the former Epistle he raised his fears, saying, “I give thee
charge in the sight of God, Who quickeneth all things” ([1 Tim. vi.
13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#013)<span id="v.iv.ix-p11.1"></span>..md):
but here he sets before him what is more dreadful, “Who shall judge the
quick and the dead,” that is, Who shall call them to account “at His
appearing and His kingdom.” When shah He judge? at His appearing with
glory, and in His kingdom. Either he says this to show that He will not
come in the way that He now has come, or, “I call to witness His coming,
and His kingdom.” He calls Him to witness, showing that he had reminded
Him of that appearing. Then teaching him how he ought to preach the
word, he adds,

<span id="v.iv.ix-p12"></span>[2 Tim.
4.2](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#002.md)<span id="v.iv.ix-p12.1"></span>.
“Preach the word: be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke,
exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.”

<span id="v.iv.ix-p13"></span>What means “in season, out of season”?
That is, have not any limited season: let it always be thy season, not
only in peace and security, and when sitting in the Church. Whether thou
be in danger, in prison, in chains, or going to thy death, at that very
time reprove. Withhold not rebuke, for reproof is then most seasonable,
when thy rebuke will be most successful, when the reality is proved.
“Exhort,” he says. After the manner of physicians, having shown the
wound, he gives the incision, he applies the plaster. For if you omit
either of these, the other becomes useless. If you rebuke without
convicting, you will seem to be rash, and no one will tolerate it, but
after the matter is proved, he will submit to rebuke: before, he will be
headstrong. And if you convict and rebuke, but vehemently, and do not
apply exhortation, <span id="fr_1424"></span>[1425](#fn_1424.md) all your
labor will be lost. For conviction <span
id="fr_1425"></span>[1426](#fn_1425.md) is intolerable in itself if
consolation be not mingled with it. As if incision, though salutary in
itself, have not plenty of lenitives to assuage the pain, the patient
cannot endure cutting and hacking, so it is in this matter.

<span id="v.iv.ix-p16"></span>“With all longsuffering and doctrine.” For
he that reproves is required to be longsuffering, that he may not
believe hastily, and rebuke needs consolation, that it may be received
as it ought. And why to “longsuffering” does he add “doctrine”? “Not as
in anger, not as in hatred, not as insulting over him, not as having
caught an enemy. Far be these things from thee.” But how? As loving as
sympathizing with him, as more distressed than himself at his grief, as
melted at his sufferings? “With all longsuffering and doctrine.” No
ordinary teaching is implied.

<span id="v.iv.ix-p17"></span>[2 Tim.
4.3](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#003.md)<span id="v.iv.ix-p17.1"></span>.
“For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine.”

<span id="v.iv.ix-p18"></span>Before they grow stiffnecked, <span
id="fr_1426"></span>[1427](#fn_1426.md) preoccupy them all. For this reason
he says, “in season, out of season”; do everything, so as to have
willing disciples.

<span id="v.iv.ix-p20"></span>“But after their own lusts,” he says,
“shall they heap to themselves teachers.”

<span id="v.iv.ix-p21"></span>Nothing can be more expressive than these
words. For by saying “they shall heap to themselves,” he shows the
indiscriminate multitude of the teachers, as also by their being elected
by their disciples. “They shall heap to themselves teachers,” he says,
“having itching ears.” Seeking for such as speak to gratify and delight
their hearers.

<span id="v.iv.ix-p22"></span>[2 Tim.
4.4](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#004.md)<span id="v.iv.ix-p22.1"></span>.
“And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and be turned unto
fables.”

<span id="v.iv.ix-p23"></span>This he foretells, not as willing to throw
him into despair, but to prepare him to bear it firmly, when it shall
happen. As Christ also did in saying, “They will deliver you up, and
they will scourge you, and bring you before the synagogues, for My
name’s sake.” ([Matt. x. 17](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#017.md)<span
id="v.iv.ix-p23.1"></span>.) And this blessed man elsewhere says, “For I
know this, that after my departures shall grievous wolves enter in among
you, not sparing the flock.” ([Acts
20.29](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#029.md)<span
id="v.iv.ix-p23.2"></span><span id="page_511">p. 511</span> <span
id="v.iv.ix-Page_511"></span>.) But this he said that they might watch,
and duly use the present opportunity.

<span id="v.iv.ix-p24"></span>[2 Tim.
4.5](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#005.md)<span id="v.iv.ix-p24.1"></span>.
“But watch thou in all things, endure affliction.”

<span id="v.iv.ix-p25"></span>It was for this therefore, that he
foretold these things; as Christ also toward the end predicted that
there should be “false Christs and false prophets”; so he too, when he
was about to depart, spoke of these things. “But watch thou in all
things, endure affliction”; that is, labor, preoccupy their minds before
this pestilence assails them; secure the safety of the sheep before the
wolves enter in, everywhere endure hardship.

<span id="v.iv.ix-p26"></span>“Do the work of an evangelist, make full
proof of thy ministry.” Thus it was the work of an evangelist that he
should endure hardship, both in himself, and from those without; “make
full proof of” that is, fulfill “thy ministry.” And behold another
necessity for his enduring affliction,

<span id="v.iv.ix-p27"></span>[2 Tim.
4.6](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#006.md)<span id="v.iv.ix-p27.1"></span>.
“For I am now ready to be poured out, <span
id="fr_1427"></span>[1428](#fn_1427.md) and the time of my departure is at
hand.”

<span id="v.iv.ix-p29"></span>He has not said of my sacrifice; but, what
is much more, “of my being poured out.” For the whole of the sacrifice
was not offered to God, but the whole of the drink-offering was.

<span id="v.iv.ix-p30"></span>[2 Tim.
4.7](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#007.md)<span id="v.iv.ix-p30.1"></span>.
“I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept
the faith.”

<span id="v.iv.ix-p31"></span>Often, when I have taken the Apostle into
my hands, and have considered this passage, I have been at a loss to
understand why Paul here speaks so loftily: “I have fought the good
fight.” But now by the grace of God I seem to have found it out. For
what purpose then does he speak thus? He is desirous to console the
despondency of his disciple, and therefore bids him be of good cheer,
since he was going to his crown, having finished all his work, and
obtained a glorious end. Thou oughtest to rejoice, he says, not to
grieve. And why? Because, “I have fought the good fight.” As a father
whose son was sitting by him, bewailing his orphan state, might console
him, saying, Weep not, my son; we have lived a good life, we have
arrived at old age, and now we leave thee. Our life has been
irreproachable, we depart with glory, and thou mayest be held in
admiration for our actions. Our king is much indebted to us. As if he
had said, We have raised trophies, we have conquered enemies, and this
not boastfully. God forbid; but to raise up his dejected son, and to
encourage him by his praises to bear firmly what had happened, to
entertain good hopes, and not to think it a matter grievous to be borne.
For sad, sad indeed is separation; and hear Paul himself, saying, “We
being bereaved of <span id="fr_1428"></span>[1429](#fn_1428.md) you for a
short time, in presence, not in heart.” ([1 Thess. ii.
17](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#017)<span id="v.iv.ix-p32.1"></span>..md)
If he then felt so much at being separated from his disciples, what
thinkest thou were the feelings of Timothy? If on parting from him
whilst living he wept, so that Paul says, “Being mindful of thy tears,
that I may be filled with joy.” ([2 Tim. i.
4](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#004)<span id="v.iv.ix-p32.2"></span>..md),
how much more at his death? These things then he wrote to console him.
Indeed the whole Epistle is full of consolation, and is a sort of
Testament. “I have fought the good fight, I have finished my course, I
have kept the faith.” “A good fight,” he says, therefore do thou engage
in it. But is that a good fight, where there are imprisonment, chains,
and death? Yea, he says for it is fought in the cause of Christ, and
great crowns are won in it. “The good fight”! There is no worthier than
this contest. This crown is without end. This is not of olive leaves. It
has not a human umpire. It has not men for spectators. The theater is
crowded with Angels. There men labor many days, and suffer hardships,
and for one hour they receive the crown, and immediately all the
pleasure passes away. But here far otherwise, it continues for ever in
brightness, glory, and honor. Henceforth we ought to rejoice. For I am
entering on my rest, I am leaving the race. Thou hast heard that “it is
better to depart and to be with Christ.”

<span id="v.iv.ix-p33"></span>I have finished “the course.” For it
behooves us both to contend and to run; to contend, by enduring
afflictions firmly, and to run, not vainly, but to some good end. It is
truly a good fight, not only delighting, but benefiting the spectator:
and the race does not end in nothing. It is not a mere display of
strength and of rivalry. It draws all up to heaven. This race is
brighter than the sun’s, yea, this which Paul ran upon earth, than that
which he runs in heaven. And how had he “finished his course”? He
traversed the whole world, beginning from Galilee and Arabia, and
advancing to the extremities of the each, so that, as he says, “From
Jerusalem and round about unto Illyricum I have fully preached the
Gospel of Christ.” ([Rom. xv. 19](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#019.md)<span
id="v.iv.ix-p33.1"></span>.) He passed over the earth like a bird, or
rather more swiftly than a bird: for a bird only flies over it, but he,
having the wing of the Spirit, made his way through numberless
impediments, dangers, deaths, and calamities, so that he was even
fleeter than a bird. Had he been a mere bird, he might have alighted and
been taken, but being upborne by the Spirit he soared above all snares,
as a bird with a wing of fire.

<span id="v.iv.ix-p34"></span>“I have kept the faith,” he says. There
were many things that would have robbed him of it, not only human
friendships, but menaces, and death, and countless other perils: but he
stood firm against all. How? by being sober and watchful. This might
have sufficed for the con<span id="page_512">p. 512</span> <span
id="v.iv.ix-Page_512"></span>solation of his disciples, but he further
adds the rewards. And what are these?

<span id="v.iv.ix-p35"></span>[2 Tim.
4.8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#008.md)<span id="v.iv.ix-p35.1"></span>.
“Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness.”

<span id="v.iv.ix-p36"></span>Here again he calls virtue in general
righteousness. Thou shouldest not grieve that I shall depart, to be
invested with that crown which will by Christ be placed upon my head.
But if I continued here, truly thy mightest rather grieve, and fear lest
I should fail and perish.

<span id="v.iv.ix-p37"></span>[2 Tim.
4.8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#008.md)<span id="v.iv.ix-p37.1"></span>.
“Which the Lord, the righteous Judge, shall give me at that day, and not
to me only, but to all that love His appearing.”

<span id="v.iv.ix-p38"></span>Here also he raises his mind. If “to all,”
much more to Timothy. But he did not say, “and to thee,” but “to all”;
meaning, if to all, much more to him.

<span id="v.iv.ix-p39"></span><span class="c13"><span
id="v.iv.ix-p39.1"></span>Moral.</span> But how, it may be asked, is one
to “love the appearing” (<span class="Greek"><span
id="v.iv.ix-p39.2"></span>τὴν ἐπιφανειαν</span>) of Christ? By rejoicing
at His coming; and he who rejoices at His coming, will perform works
worthy of His joy; he will throw away his substance if need be, and even
his life, so that he may obtain future blessings, that he may be thought
worthy to behold that second coming in a fitting state, in confidence,
in brightness and glory. This is to “love His appearing.” He who loves
His appearing will do everything to ensure, before His general coming, a
particular coming to himself. And how, you will say, is this possible?
Hear from Christ, who says, “If a man love Me, he will keep My words,
and My Father and I will come unto him, and make Our abode with him.”
([John xiv. 23](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#023.md)<span
id="v.iv.ix-p39.3"></span>.) And think how great a privilege it is that
He who will appear to all generally, should promise to come to us in
particular: for He says, “We will come and make Our abode with him.” If
any man “love His appearing,” he will do everything to invite Him to
himself, and to hold Him, that the light may shine upon him. Let there
be nothing unworthy of His coming, and He will soon take up His abode
with us.

<span id="v.iv.ix-p40"></span>And it is called His “Epiphany,” <span
id="fr_1429"></span>[1430](#fn_1429.md) because He will appear above, <span
id="fr_1430"></span>[1431](#fn_1430.md) and shine forth from on high. Let
us therefore “seek those things that are above,” and we shall soon draw
down those beams upon us. None of those who grovel below, and bury
themselves in this lower earth, will be able to view the light of that
Sun. None of those who defile themselves with worldly things will be
able to behold that Sun of righteousness. He shines on none of those who
are so occupied. Recover thyself a little, recover thyself from that
depth, from the waves of a worldly life, if thou wouldest see the Sun,
and enjoy His appearing. Then thou wilt see Him with great confidence.
Be even now a philosopher. Let not a spirit of perverseness possess
thee, lest He smite thee severely, and bring thee low. Let not thy heart
be hardened; nor darkened, lest thou be shipwrecked there. Let there be
no self-deceit. For the rocks beneath the sea cause the most fatal
shipwrecks. Nourish no wild beasts, I mean evil passions, worse than
wild beasts. Confide not in things ever flowing, that thou mayest be
able to stand firmly. None can stand upon water, but upon a rock all
find a secure footing. Worldly things are as water, as a torrent, that
passes away. “The waters,” he saith, “are come in unto my soul.” ([Ps.
lxix. 1](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#001.md)<span
id="v.iv.ix-p42.1"></span>.) Spiritual things are as a rock. For he
saith, “Thou hast set my feet upon a rock.” ([Ps. xl.
2](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#002)<span id="v.iv.ix-p42.2"></span>..md)
Worldly things are as mire and clay; let us extricate ourselves from
them. For so we shall be able to attain to the appearing of Christ.
Whatever may befall us, let us endure. It is a sufficient consolation in
all circumstances that we suffer for Christ. This divine incantation let
us repeat, and it will charm away the pain of every wound.

<span id="v.iv.ix-p43"></span>And how can we suffer for Christ, you ask?
If one accuse thee falsely in any case, not on account of Christ, yet if
thou bearest it patiently, if thou givest thanks, if thou prayest for
him, all this thou doest for Christ. But if thou curse him, if thou
utter discontent, if thou attempt to revenge it, though thou shouldest
not be able, it is not for Christ’s sake; thou sufferest loss, and art
deprived of thy reward on account of thy intention. For it rests with us
either to profit, or to be injured, by afflictions. It depends not upon
the nature of the affliction, but upon the disposition of our own minds.
As, for instance, great were the sufferings of Job, yet he suffered with
thankfulness; and he was justified, not because he suffered, but because
in suffering he endured it thankfully. Another under the same
sufferings, yet not the same, for none ever suffered like Job—but under
lighter sufferings, exclaims, is impatient, curses the whole world, and
complains against God. He is condemned and sentenced, not because he
suffered, but because he blasphemed; and he blasphemed, not from any
necessity arising from his afflictions, since if necessity arising from
events were the cause, Job too must have blasphemed; but since he, who
suffered more severely, did no such thing, it did not come to pass from
this cause, but from the man’s weakness of purpose. We want therefore
strength of soul, and nothing will then appear grievous, but if our soul
is weak, we find a grievance in everything.

<span id="v.iv.ix-p44"></span>According to our dispositions, all things
become tolerable or intolerable. Let us strengthen our resolution, and
we shall bear all things easily. The tree whose roots are fixed deep in
the earth is not shaken by the utmost violence of the storm, but if it
be set lightly in the surface of <span id="page_513">p. 513</span> <span
id="v.iv.ix-Page_513"></span>the ground, a slight gust of wind will tear
it up from the roots. So it is with us; if our flesh be nailed down by
the fear of God, nothing will be able to shake us; but if we merely
intend well, a little shock will subvert and destroy us. Wherefore, I
exhort, let us bear all with much cheerfulness, imitating the Prophet,
who says, “My soul cleaveth to Thee”; observe, he says not, draweth
nigh, but “cleaveth to Thee”; and again, “My soul thirsteth for Thee.”
([Ps. lxii. 3](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#003.md)<span
id="v.iv.ix-p44.1"></span>.) He said not merely “longeth,” that he might
by such words express the vehemence of his desire; and again, “Fix <span
id="fr_1431"></span>[1432](#fn_1431.md) my flesh in Thy fear.” ([Ps. cxix.
120](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#120.md)<span id="v.iv.ix-p45.2"></span>,
Sept.) For he wishes us so to cleave and be united to Him, that we may
never be separated from Him. If thus we hold by God, if thus we rivet
our thoughts upon Him, if we thirst with the love of Him, all that we
desire will be ours, and we shall obtain the good things to come, in
Jesus Christ our Lord, to whom with the Father and the Holy Ghost be
glory, power, and honor, now and for ever. Amen.
