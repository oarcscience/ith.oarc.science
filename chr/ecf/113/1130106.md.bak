<span id="v.iii.xiv-p3"></span>“These things command and teach. Let no
man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word,
in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity. Till I
come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine. Neglect
not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the
laying on of the hands of the presbytery.”

<span id="v.iii.xiv-p4"></span><span class="c13"><span
id="v.iii.xiv-p4.1"></span>In</span> some cases it is necessary to
command, in others to teach; if therefore you command in those cases
where teaching is required, you will become ridiculous. Again, if you
teach where you ought to command, you are exposed to the same reproach.
For instance, it is not proper to teach a man not to be wicked, but to
command; to forbid it with all authority. Not to profess Judaism, should
be a command, but teaching is required, when you would lead men to part
with their possessions, to profess virginity, or when you would
discourse of faith. Therefore Paul mentions both: “Command and teach.”
When a man uses amulets, or does anything of that kind, knowing it to be
wrong, he requires only a command; but he who does it ignorantly, is to
be taught his error. “Let no one despise thy youth.”

<span id="v.iii.xiv-p5"></span>Observe that it becomes a priest to
command and to speak authoritatively, and not always to teach. But
because, from a common prejudice, youth is apt to be despised, therefore
he says, “Let no man despise thy youth.” For a teacher ought not to be
exposed to contempt. But if he is not to be despised, what room is there
for meekness and moderation? Indeed the contempt that he fails into
personally he ought to bear; for teaching is commended by longsuffering.
But not so, where others are concerned; for this is not meekness, but
coldness. If a man revenge insults, and ill language, and injuries
offered to himself, you justly blame him. But where the salvation of
others is concerned, command, and interpose with authority. This is not
a case for moderation, but for authority, lest the public good suffer.
He enjoins one or the other as the case may require. Let no one despise
thee on account of thy youth. For as long as thy life is a counterpoise,
thou wilt not be despised for thy youth, but even the more admired:
therefore he proceeds to say,

<span id="v.iii.xiv-p6"></span>“But be thou an example of the believers
in word, in conversation, in charity, in faith, in purity.” In all
things showing thyself an example of good works: that is, be thyself a
pattern of a Christian life, as a model set before others, as a living
law, as a rule and standard of good living, for such ought a teacher to
be. “In word,” that he may speak with facility, “in conversation, in
charity, in faith, in” true “purity, in temperance.”

<span id="v.iii.xiv-p7"></span>“Till I come give attendance to reading,
to exhortation, to doctrine.”

<span id="v.iii.xiv-p8"></span>Even Timothy is commanded to apply to
reading. Let us then be instructed not to neglect the study of the
sacred writings. Again, observe, he says, “Till I come.” Mark how he
consoles him, for being as it were an orphan, when separated from him,
it was natural that he should require such comfort. “Till I come,” he
says, give attendance to reading the divine writings, to exhortation of
one another, to teaching of all.

<span id="v.iii.xiv-p9"></span>“Neglect not the gift that is in thee,
which was given thee by prophecy.”

<span id="v.iii.xiv-p10"></span>Here he calls teaching prophecy. <span
id="fr_1228"></span>[1229](#fn_1228.md)

<span id="v.iii.xiv-p12"></span>“With the laying on of the hands of the
presbytery.” He speaks not here of Presbyters, but of Bishops. For
Presbyters cannot be supposed to have ordained a Bishop.

<span id="v.iii.xiv-p13"></span>[1 Tim.
4.15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#015.md)<span
id="v.iii.xiv-p13.1"></span>. “Meditate upon these things; give thyself
wholly to them.”

<span id="v.iii.xiv-p14"></span>Observe how often he gives him counsel
concerning the same things, thus showing that a teacher ought above all
things to be attentive to these points.

<span id="v.iii.xiv-p15"></span>[1 Tim.
4.16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#016.md)<span
id="v.iii.xiv-p15.1"></span>. “Take heed,” he says, “unto thyself, and
unto the doctrine: continue in them.” That is, take heed to thyself, and
teach others also.

<span id="v.iii.xiv-p16"></span>“For in so doing thou shalt both save
thyself and them that hear thee.”

<span id="v.iii.xiv-p17"></span>It is well said, “Thou shalt save
thyself.” For he that is “nourished up in the words of sound doctrine,”
first receives the benefit of it himself. From admonishing others, he is
touched with compunction himself. For these things are not said to
Timothy only, but to all. And if such advice is addressed to him, who
raised the dead, what shall be said to us? Christ also shows the duty of
teachers, when He says, “The kingdom of heaven is like unto an
householder, who bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old.”
([Matt. xiii. 52](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#052.md)<span
id="v.iii.xiv-p17.1"></span>.) And the blessed Paul gives the same
advice, that “we through patience and comfort of the Scriptures might
have hope.” <span id="page_450">p. 450</span> <span
id="v.iii.xiv-Page_450"></span>([Rom. xv.
4](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#004)<span id="v.iii.xiv-p17.2"></span>..md)
This he practiced above all men, being brought up in the law of his
fathers, at the feet of Gamaliel, whence he would afterwards naturally
apply to reading: for he who exhorted others would himself first follow
the advice he gave. Hence we find him continually appealing to the
testimony of the prophets, and searching into their writings. Paul then
applies to reading, for it is no slight advantage that is to be reaped
from the Scriptures. But we are indolent, and we hear with carelessness
and indifference. What punishment do we not deserve!

<span id="v.iii.xiv-p18"></span>“That thy profiting may appear,” he
says, “to all.”

<span id="v.iii.xiv-p19"></span>Thus he would have him appear great and
admirable in this respect also, showing that this was still necessary
for him, for he wished that his “profiting should appear” not only in
his life, but in the word of doctrine.

<span id="v.iii.xiv-p20"></span>[1 Tim.
5.1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#001.md)<span id="v.iii.xiv-p20.1"></span>.
“Rebuke not an elder.”

<span id="v.iii.xiv-p21"></span>Is he now speaking of the order? I think
not, but of any elderly man. What then if he should need correction? Do
not rebuke him, but address him as you would a father offending.

<span id="v.iii.xiv-p22"></span>[1 Tim.
5.1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#001.md)<span id="v.iii.xiv-p22.1"></span>.
“The elder women as mothers, the younger men as brethren; the younger
women as sisters, with all purity.”

<span id="v.iii.xiv-p23"></span>Rebuke is in its own nature offensive,
particularly when it is addressed to an old man, and when it proceeds
from a young man too, there is a threefold show of forwardness. By the
manner and the mildness of it, therefore, he would soften it. For it is
possible to reprove without offense, if one will only make a point of
this: it requires great discretion, but it may be done.

<span id="v.iii.xiv-p24"></span>“The younger men as brethren.” Why does
he recommend this too here? With a view to the high spirit natural to
young men, whence it is proper to soften reproof to them also with
moderation.

<span id="v.iii.xiv-p25"></span>“The younger women as sisters”; he adds,
“with all purity.” Tell me not, he means, of merely avoiding sinful
intercourse with them. There should not be even a suspicion. For since
intimacy with young women is always suspicious, and yet a Bishop cannot
always avoid it, he shows by adding these words, that “all purity” is
required in such intimacy. But does Paul give this advice to Timothy?
Yes, he says, for I am speaking to the world through him. But if Timothy
was thus advised, let others consider what sort of conduct is required
of them, that they should give no ground for suspicion, no shadow of
pretext, to those who wish to calumniate.

<span id="v.iii.xiv-p26"></span>[1 Tim.
5.3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#003.md)<span id="v.iii.xiv-p26.1"></span>.
“Honor widows, that are widows indeed.”

<span id="v.iii.xiv-p27"></span>Why does he say nothing of virginity,
nor command us to honor virgins? Perhaps there were not yet any
professing that state, or they might have fallen from it. “For some,” he
says, “are already turned aside after Satan.” ([1 Tim. v.
15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#015)<span id="v.iii.xiv-p27.1"></span>..md)
For a woman may have lost her husband, and yet not be truly a widow. As
in order to be a virgin, it is not enough to be a stranger to marriage,
but many other things are necessary, as blamelessness and perseverance;
so the loss of a husband does not constitute a widow, but patience, with
chastity and separation from all men. Such widows he justly bids us
honor, or rather support. For they need support, being left desolate,
and having no husband to stand up for them. Their state appears to the
multitude despicable and inauspicious. Therefore he wishes them to
receive the greater honor from the Priest, and the more so, because they
are worthy of it.

<span id="v.iii.xiv-p28"></span>[1 Tim.
5.4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#004.md)<span id="v.iii.xiv-p28.1"></span>.
“But if any widow have children or grandchildren, let them learn first
to show piety at home, and to requite their parents.”

<span id="v.iii.xiv-p29"></span>Observe the discretion of Paul; how
often he urges men from human considerations. For he does not here lay
down any great and lofty motive, but one that is easy to be understood:
“to requite their parents.” How? For bringing them up and educating
them. As if he should say, Thou hast received from them great care. They
are departed. Thou canst not requite them. For thou didst not bring them
forth, nor nourish them. Requite them <span
id="fr_1229"></span>[1230](#fn_1229.md) in their descendants, repay the
debt through the children. “Let them learn first to show piety at home.”
Here he more simply exhorts them to acts of kindness; then to excite
them the more, he adds,

<span id="v.iii.xiv-p31"></span>“For that is good and acceptable before
God.” And as he had spoken of those “who are widows indeed,” he declares
who is indeed a widow.

<span id="v.iii.xiv-p32"></span>[1 Tim.
5.5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#005.md)<span id="v.iii.xiv-p32.1"></span>.
“Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusteth in God, and
continueth in supplications and prayers night and day. But she that
liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth.”

<span id="v.iii.xiv-p33"></span>She who being a widow has not made
choice of a worldly life, is a widow indeed; she who trusts in God as
she ought, and continues instant in prayer night and day, is a widow
indeed. Not that she, who has children, is not a widow indeed. For he
commends her who brings up children as she ought. But if any one has not
children, he means, she is desolate, and her he consoles, saying, that
she is most truly a widow, who has lost not only the consolation of a
husband, but that arising from children, yet she has <span
id="page_451">p. 451</span> <span id="v.iii.xiv-Page_451"></span>God in
the place of all. She is not the worse for not having children, but He
fills up her need with consolation, in that she is without children.
What he says amounts to this. Grieve not, when it is said that a widow
ought to bring up children, as if, because thou hast no children thy
worth were on that account inferior. Thou art a widow indeed, whereas
she who liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth.

<span id="v.iii.xiv-p34"></span>But since many who have children
choose <span id="fr_1230"></span>[1231](#fn_1230.md) the state of
widowhood, not to cut off the occasions of a worldly life, but rather to
enhance them, that they may do what they will with the greater license,
and indulge the more freely in worldly lusts: therefore he says, “She
that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth.” Ought not a widow
then to live in pleasure? Surely not. If then when nature and age is
weak, a life of pleasure is not allowable, but leads to death, eternal
death; what have men to say, who live a life of pleasure? But he says
with reason, “She that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth.” But
that thou mayest see this, let us now see what is the state of the dead,
and what of the living, and in which shall we place such an one? The
living perform the works of life, of that future life, which is truly
life. And Christ has declared what are the works of that future life,
with which we ought always to be occupied. “Come, inherit the kingdom
prepared for you from the foundation of the world. For I was an
hungered, and ye gave me meat. I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink.”
([Matt. 25:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#034.md),
[35](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#035.md)<span
id="v.iii.xiv-p35.2"></span>.) The living differ from the dead, not only
in that they behold the sun, and breathe the air, but in that they are
doing some good. For if this be wanting, the living are not better than
the dead. That you may learn this, hear how it is possible that even the
dead should live. For it is said, “God is not the God of the dead, but
of the living.” ([Matt. xxii. 32](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#032.md)<span
id="v.iii.xiv-p35.3"></span>.) But this again you say is a riddle. Let
us therefore solve them both. A man who liveth in pleasure, is dead
whilst he liveth. For he liveth only to his belly. In his other senses
he lives not. He sees not what he ought to see, he hears not what he
ought to hear, he speaks not what he ought to speak. Nor does he perform
the actions of the living. But as he who is stretched upon a bed, with
his eyes closed, and his eyelids fast, perceives nothing that is
passing; so it is with this man, or rather not so, but worse. For the
one is equally insensible to things good and evil, but the latter is
sensible to things evil only, but as insensible as the former to things
good. Thus he is dead. For nothing relating to the life to come moves or
affects him. For intemperance, taking him into her own bosom, as into
some dark and dismal cavern, full of all uncleanness, causes him to
dwell altogether in darkness, like the dead. For when all his time is
spent between feasting and drunkenness, is he not dead, and buried in
darkness? Even in the morning when he seems to be sober, he is not sober
in reality, since he has not yet rid and cleansed himself of yesterday’s
excess and is still longing for a repetition, and in that his evening
and noon he passes in revels, and all the night, and most of the morning
in deep sleep.

<span id="v.iii.xiv-p36"></span>Is he then to be numbered with the
living? Who can describe that storm that comes of luxury, that assails
his soul and body? For as a sky continually clouded admits not the
sunbeams to shine through it, so the fumes of luxury and wine enveloping
his brain, as if it were some rock, and casting over it a thick mist,
suffer not reason to exert itself, but overspread the drunken man with
profound darkness. With him who is thus affected, how great must be the
storm within, how violent the tumult. As when a flood of water has
risen, and has surmounted the entrances of the workshops, <span
id="fr_1231"></span>[1232](#fn_1231.md) we see all the inmates in
confusion, and using tubs and pitchers and sponges, and many other
contrivances to bale it out, that it may not both undermine the
building, and spoil all that is contained in it: so it is when luxury
overwhelms the soul; its reasonings within are disturbed. What is
already collected, cannot be discharged, and by the introduction of
more, a violent storm is raised. For look not at the cheerful and merry
countenance, but examine the interior, and you will see it full of deep
dejection. If it were possible to bring the soul into view, and to
behold it with our bodily eyes, that of the luxurious would seem
depressed, mournful, miserable, and wasted with leanness; for the more
the body grows sleek and gross, the more lean and weakly is the soul;
and the more one is pampered, <span id="fr_1232"></span>[1233](#fn_1232.md)
the more is the other hampered. <span
id="fr_1233"></span>[1234](#fn_1233.md) As, when the pupil of the eye has
the external coats over it too thick, it cannot put forth the power of
vision, <span id="fr_1234"></span>[1235](#fn_1234.md) and look out, because
the light is excluded by the thick covering, and darkness often ensues;
so when the body is constantly full fed, the soul must be invested with
grossness. But the dead rot, and are corrupted, you say; and an
unwholesome moisture distills from them. So in her “that liveth in
pleasure,” may be seen rheums, and phlegm, catarrh, hiccough, vomitings,
eructations, and the like, which, as too unseemly, I forbear to name.
For such is the dominion of luxury, that it makes one endure things,
which we do not even think proper to mention.

<span id="v.iii.xiv-p41"></span><span id="page_452">p. 452</span> <span
id="v.iii.xiv-Page_452"></span>But you still ask, how is the body
dissolved whilst it yet eats and drinks? Surely this is no sign of human
life, since creatures without reason too eat and drink. Where the soul
lies dead, what do eating and drinking avail? The dead body, that is
invested with a flowery garment, is not benefited by it, and when a
blooming body invests a dead soul, the soul is not benefited. For when
its whole discourse is of cooks, and caterers, and confectioners, and it
utters nothing pious, <span id="fr_1235"></span>[1236](#fn_1235.md) is it
not dead? For let us consider what is man? The Heathens say that he is a
rational animal, mortal, capable of intelligence and knowledge. But let
us not take our definition from them, but whence? From the sacred
writings. Where then has the Scripture given a definition of man? Hear
its words. “There was a man perfect and upright, one that feared God,
and eschewed evil.” ([Job i. 2](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#002.md)<span
id="v.iii.xiv-p42.1"></span>.) This was indeed a man! Again, another
says, “Man is great, and the merciful man is precious.” ([Prov. xx.
6](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#006.md)<span id="v.iii.xiv-p42.2"></span>,
Sept.) Those who answer not to this description, though they partake of
mind, and are never so capable of knowledge, the Scripture refuses to
acknowledge them as men, but calls them dogs, and horses, and serpents,
and foxes, and wolves, and if there be any animals more contemptible. If
such then is man, he that liveth in pleasure is not a man; for how can
he be, who never thinks of anything that he ought? Luxury and sobriety
cannot exist together: they are destructive of one another. Even the
Heathens say,

<span id="v.iii.xiv-p43"></span>“A heavy paunch bears not a subtle
mind.” <span id="fr_1236"></span>[1237](#fn_1236.md)

<span id="v.iii.xiv-p45"></span>Such as these the Scripture calls men
without souls. “My Spirit (it is said) shall not always abide in these
men, because they are flesh.” ([Gen. vi.
3](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#003.md)<span id="v.iii.xiv-p45.1"></span>,
Sept.) Yet they had a soul, but because it was dead in them, He calls
them flesh. For as in the case of the virtuous, though they have a body,
we say, “he is all soul, he is all spirit,” so the reverse is said of
those who are otherwise. So Paul also said of those, who did not fulfill
the works of the flesh, “Ye are not in the flesh.” ([Rom. viii.
9](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#009)<span id="v.iii.xiv-p45.2"></span>..md)
Thus those who live in luxury are not in the soul or in the spirit.

<span id="v.iii.xiv-p46"></span><span class="c13"><span
id="v.iii.xiv-p46.1"></span>Moral</span>. “She that liveth in pleasure
is dead while she liveth.” Hear this, ye women, that pass your time in
revels and intemperance, and who neglect the poor, pining and perishing
with hunger, whilst you are destroying yourself with continual luxury.
Thus you are the causes of two deaths, of those who are dying of want,
and of your own, both through ill measure. But if out of your fullness
you tempered their want, you would save two lives. Why do you thus gorge
your own body with excess, and waste that of the poor with want; why
pamper this above measure, and stint that too beyond measure? Consider
what comes of food, into what it is changed. Are you not disgusted at
its being named? Why then be eager for such accumulations? The increase
of luxury is but the multiplication of dung! For nature has her limits,
and what is beyond these is not nourishment, but injury, and the
increase of ordure. Nourish the body, but do not destroy it. Food is
called nourishment, to show that its design is not to injure the body,
but to nourish it. For this reason perhaps food passes into excrement,
that we may not be lovers of luxury. For if it were not so, if it were
not useless and injurious to the body, we should not cease from
devouring one another. If the belly received as much as it pleased,
digested it, and conveyed it to the body, we should see wars and battles
innumerable. Even now when part of our food passes into ordure, part
into blood, part into spurious and useless phlegm, we are nevertheless
so addicted to luxury, that we spend perhaps whole estates on a meal.
What should we not do, if this were not the end of luxury? The more
luxuriously we live, the more noisome are the odors with which we are
filled. The body is like a swollen bottle, running out every way. The
eructations are such as to pain the head of a bystander. From the heat
of fermentation within, vapors are sent forth, as from a furnace, if
bystanders are pained, what, think you, is the brain within continually
suffering, assailed by these fumes? to say nothing of the channels of
the heated and obstructed blood, of those reservoirs, the liver and the
spleen, and of the canals by which the fæces are discharged. The drains
in our streets we take care to keep unobstructed. We cleanse our sewers
with poles and drags, that they may not be stopped, or overflow, but the
canals of our bodies we do not keep clear, but obstruct and choke them
up, and when the filth rises to the very throne of the king, I mean the
brain, we do not regard it, treating it not like a worthy king, but like
an unclean brute. God hath purposely removed to a distance those unclean
members, that we might not receive offense from them. But we suffer it
not to be so, and spoil all by our excess. And other evils might be
mentioned. To obstruct the sewers is to breed a pestilence; but if a
stench from without is pestilential, that which is pent up within the
body, and cannot find a vent, what disorders must it not produce both to
body and soul? Some have strangely complained, wondering why God has
ordained that we should bear a load of ordure with us. But they
themselves increase the load. God designed thus to detach us from
luxury, and to persuade us not to attach ourselves to worldly <span
id="page_453">p. 453</span> <span id="v.iii.xiv-Page_453"></span>things.
But thou art not thus to be persuaded to cease from gluttony, but though
it is but as far as the throat, and as long as the hour of eating, nay
not even so long, that the pleasure abides, thou continuest in thine
indulgence. Is it not true that as soon as it has passed the palate and
the throat, the pleasure ceases? For the sense of it is in the taste,
and after that is gratified, a nausea succeeds, the stomach not
digesting the food, or not without much difficulty. Justly then is it
said, that “she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth.” For
the luxurious soul is unable to hear or to see anything. It becomes
weak, ignoble, unmanly, illiberal, cowardly, full of impudence,
servility, ignorance, rage, violence, and all kinds of evil, and
destitute of the opposite virtues. Therefore he says,

<span id="v.iii.xiv-p47"></span>[1 Tim.
5.7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#007.md)<span id="v.iii.xiv-p47.1"></span>.
“These things give in charge, that they may be blameless.”

<span id="v.iii.xiv-p48"></span>He does not leave it to their choice.
Command them, he says, not to be luxurious, assuming it to be
confessedly an evil, as not holding it lawful or admissible for the
luxurious to partake of the Holy Mysteries. “These things command,” he
says, “that they may be blameless.” Thus you see it is reckoned among
sins. For if it were a matter of choice, though it were left undone, we
might still be blameless. Therefore in obedience to Paul, let us command
the luxurious widow not to have place in the list of widows. <span
id="fr_1237"></span>[1238](#fn_1237.md) For if a soldier, who frequents the
bath, the theater, the busy scenes of life, is judged to desert his
duty, much more the widows. Let us then not seek our rest here, that we
may find it hereafter. Let us not live in pleasure here, that we may
hereafter enjoy true pleasure, true delight, which brings no evil with
it, but infinite good. Of which God grant that we may all be partakers,
in Jesus Christ, with whom, &c.
