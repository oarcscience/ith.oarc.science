<span id="v.iii.xvi-p3"></span>“But the younger widows refuse: for when
they have begun to wax wanton against Christ, they will marry; having
condemnation, because they have cast off their first faith. And withal
they learn to be idle, wandering about from house to house; and not only
idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things which they ought
not. I will therefore that the younger widows marry, bear children,
guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak
reproachfully. For some are already turned aside after Satan.”

<span id="v.iii.xvi-p4"></span><span class="c13"><span
id="v.iii.xvi-p4.1"></span>Paul</span> having discoursed much concerning
widows, and having settled the age at which they were to be admitted,
saying, “Let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years
old,” and having described the qualifications of a widow, “If she have
brought up children, if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed
the Saints’ feet,” proceeds now to say, “But the younger widows refuse.”
But concerning virgins, though the case of their falling is a much more
gross one, he has said nothing of this kind, and rightly. For they had
enrolled themselves on higher views, and the work with them proceeded
from a greater elevation of mind. Therefore the receiving of strangers,
and the washing of the Saints’ feet, he has represented by “attending
upon the Lord without distraction” <span
id="fr_1264"></span>[1265](#fn_1264.md) ([1 Cor.
7:34](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#034.md),
[35](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#035.md)<span
id="v.iii.xvi-p5.1"></span>.), and by saying, “The unmarried careth for
the things that belong to the Lord.” ([1 Cor.
7:34](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#034.md),
[35](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#035)<span id="v.iii.xvi-p5.2"></span>..md)
And if he has not limited a particular age for them, it is most likely
because that point is settled by what he has said in this case. But
indeed, as I said, the choice of virginity proceeded from a higher
purpose. Besides, in this case there had been falls, and thus they had
given occasion for his rule, but nothing of that kind had occurred among
the virgins. For that some had already fallen away is plain, in that he
says, “When they have begun to wax wanton against Christ, they
will <span id="fr_1265"></span>[1266](#fn_1265.md) marry”; and again, “For
some have already turned aside after Satan.”

<span id="v.iii.xvi-p7"></span>“The younger widows refuse, for when they
have begun to wax wanton against Christ, they will marry”; that is, when
they have become scornful <span id="fr_1266"></span>[1267](#fn_1266.md) and
luxurious. For as in the case of a just man, we might say, “Let her
depart, for she has become another’s.” <span
id="fr_1267"></span>[1268](#fn_1267.md) He shows therefore that though they
chose widowhood, it was not the choice of their judgment. So then a
widow, by the state of widowhood, is espoused to Christ. For He has
said, “I am the defender of the widows and the father of the orphans.”
([Ps. lxviii. 5](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#005.md)<span
id="v.iii.xvi-p9.1"></span>.) He shows that they do not choose widowhood
as they ought, but wax wanton: however he bears with them. Elsewhere
indeed he says, “I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present
you as a chaste virgin to Christ.” ([2 Cor. xi.
2](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#002)<span id="v.iii.xvi-p9.2"></span>..md)
After having given their names to Him, <span
id="fr_1268"></span>[1269](#fn_1268.md) “they will marry,” he says, “having
condemnation, because they have cast off their first faith.” By faith he
means, fidelity to their covenant. As if he had said, They have been
false to Christ, they have dishonored Him, and transgressed His
covenant. “And withal they learn to be idle.”

<span id="v.iii.xvi-p11"></span>Thus he commands not only men, but women
also, to work. For idleness is the teacher of every sin. And not only
are they exposed to this condemnation, but to other sins. If therefore
it is unbecoming for a married woman “to go from house to house,” much
more is it for a virgin. “And not only idle, but tattlers also and
busybodies, speaking things which they ought not. I will therefore that
the younger widows marry, bear children, guide the house.”

<span id="v.iii.xvi-p12"></span>What then happens, when the care for the
husband is withdrawn, and the care to please God does not constrain
them? They naturally become idlers, tattlers, and busybodies. For he who
does not attend to his own concerns will be meddling with those of
others, even as he who minds his own business will take no account of
and have no care about the affairs of another. And nothing is so
unbecoming to a woman, as to busy herself in the concerns of others, and
it is no less unbecoming to a man. This is a great sign of impudence and
forwardness.

<span id="v.iii.xvi-p13"></span>“I will therefore,” he says, (since they
themselves wish it,) “that the younger widows marry, bear children,
guide the house.”

<span id="v.iii.xvi-p14"></span>This course is at least preferable to
the other. They ought indeed to be concerned for the things of God, they
ought to preserve their faith. But since they do not this, it is better
to avoid a worse course. God is not dishonored by their marrying again,
and they do not fall into those practices, which have been censured.
From such a widowhood, no good could arise, but good may come out of
this marriage. Hence <span id="page_460">p. 460</span> <span
id="v.iii.xvi-Page_460"></span>the women will be able to correct that
indolence and vanity of mind.

<span id="v.iii.xvi-p15"></span>But why, since some have fallen away,
does he not say that much care is to be taken of them, that they may not
fall into the error he has mentioned? Why has he commanded them to
marry? Because marriage is not forbidden, and it is a safeguard to them.
Wherefore he adds, that they “give none occasion,” or handle, “to the
adversary to speak reproachfully. For some are already turned aside
after Satan.” Such widows as these then he would have refused, not
meaning that there should be no younger widows, but that there should be
no adulteresses, that none should be idle, busy-bodies, speaking things
that they ought not, that no occasion should be given to the adversary.
Had nothing of this kind taken place, he would not have forbidden them.

<span id="v.iii.xvi-p16"></span>[1 Tim.
5.16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#016.md)<span
id="v.iii.xvi-p16.1"></span>. “If any man or woman that believeth have
widows, let them relieve them, and let not the Church be charged, that
it may relieve them that are widows indeed.”

<span id="v.iii.xvi-p17"></span>Observe how again he speaks of those as
“widows indeed,” who are left destitute, and have no resource from any
other quarter. It was better to have it so. For thus two great objects
were attained. Those <span id="fr_1269"></span>[1270](#fn_1269.md) had an
opportunity of doing good, whilst these were honorably maintained, and
the Church not burdened. And he has well said, “If any believer.” For it
is not fit that believing women should be maintained by unbelievers,
lest they should seem to stand in need of them. And observe how
persuasively he speaks; he has not said, “let them maintain them
expensively,” but “let them relieve them.” “That the Church,” he says,
“may relieve them that are widows indeed.” She therefore has the reward
of this help also, for she that helps the Church, helps not her only,
but those widows too whom the Church is thus enabled to maintain more
bountifully. “I will therefore that the younger widows”—do what? live in
luxury and pleasure? By no means; but—“marry, bear children, guide the
house.” That he may not be supposed to encourage them to live
luxuriously, he adds, that they give no occasion to the adversary to
speak reproachfully. They ought indeed to have been superior to the
things of this world, but since they are not, let them abide in them at
least upright.

<span id="v.iii.xvi-p19"></span>[1 Tim.
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#017.md),
[18](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#018.md)<span id="v.iii.xvi-p19.1"></span>.
“Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honor,
especially they who labor in the word and doctrine. For the Scripture
saith, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn. And, The
laborer is worthy of his reward.”

<span id="v.iii.xvi-p20"></span>The “honor” of which he here speaks is
attention to them, and the supply of their necessities, as is shown by
his adding, “Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn”
([Deut. xxv. 4](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#004.md)<span
id="v.iii.xvi-p20.1"></span>.); and, “The laborer is worthy of his
reward.” ([Luke x. 7](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#007.md)<span
id="v.iii.xvi-p20.2"></span>.) So when he says, “Honor widows,” he
means, “support” them in all that is necessary. Thus he says, “That it
may relieve those that are widows indeed”; and again, “Honor widows that
are widows indeed,” that is, who are in poverty, for the greater their
poverty, the more truly are they widows. He alleges the Law, he alleges
the words of Christ, both agreeing herein. For the Law says, “Thou shalt
not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn.” See how he would have the
teacher labor! For there is not, indeed there is not, any other labor
such as his. But this is from the Law. But how does he quote from
Christ? “The laborer is worthy of his reward.” Let us not then look only
to the reward, but to the terms of the commandment. “The laborer,” he
says, “is worthy of his reward.” So that if any one lives in sloth and
luxury, he is unworthy of it. Unless he is as the ox treading out the
corn, and bearing the yoke, in spite of heat and thorns, and ceases not
till he has carried the corn into the granary, he is not worthy.
Therefore to teachers should be granted a supply of their necessities
without grudging, that they may not faint nor be discouraged, nor by
attention to inferior things deprive themselves of greater; that they
may labor for spiritual things, paying no regard to worldly things. It
was thus with the Levites; they had no worldly concerns, because the
laity took care to provide for them, and their revenues were appointed
by the law, as tythes, offerings of gold, <span
id="fr_1270"></span>[1271](#fn_1270.md) first-fruits, vows, and many other
things. And the law properly assigned these things to them, as seeking
things present. But I shall say no more than that those who preside
ought to have food and raiment, that they may not be distracted by care
for these things. But what is double support? Double that of the widows,
or of the deacons, or simply, liberal support. Let us not then think
only of the double maintenance granted them, but of what is added,
“Those who rule well.” And what is it to rule well? Let us hear Christ,
Who says, “The good shepherd giveth his life for his sheep.” ([John x.
11](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#011)<span id="v.iii.xvi-p21.1"></span>..md)
Thus to rule well is, from our concern for them, never to spare
ourselves.

<span id="v.iii.xvi-p22"></span>“Especially those who labor in the word
and doctrine.” Where then are those who say that there is no occasion
for the word and doctrine? <span id="page_461">p. 461</span> <span
id="v.iii.xvi-Page_461"></span>Whereas he says to Timothy, “Meditate
upon these things; give thyself wholly to them”; and, “Give attendance
to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine; for in doing this thou shalt
save both thyself, and them that hear thee.” ([1 Tim.
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#015.md),
[16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#016.md)<span
id="v.iii.xvi-p22.1"></span>.) These are the men whom he wishes to be
honored most of all, and he adds the reason, for they sustain great
labor. For when one is neither watchful, nor diligent, but merely sits
in his stall easy and unconcerned, <span
id="fr_1271"></span>[1272](#fn_1271.md) whilst another wears himself out
with anxiety and exertion, <span id="fr_1272"></span>[1273](#fn_1272.md)
especially if he is ignorant of profane literature, ought not the latter
to be honored above all others, who more than others gives himself up to
such labors? For he is exposed to numberless tongues. One censures him,
another praises him, a third mocks him, another finds fault with his
memory and his composition, and it requires great strength of mind to
endure all this. It is an important point, and contributes much to the
edification of the Church, that the rulers of it should be apt to teach.
If this be wanting, many things in the Church go to ruin. Therefore in
addition to the qualifications of hospitality, moderation, and a
blameless life, he enumerates this also, saying, “Apt to teach.” For why
else indeed is he called a teacher? Some say that he may teach
philosophy by the example of his life, so that all else is superfluous,
and there is no need of verbal instruction in order to proficiency. But
why then does Paul say, “especially they who labor in the word and
doctrine”? For when doctrines are concerned, what life will answer the
purpose? And of what word is he speaking? Not of pompous language, nor
of discourse set off with external <span
id="fr_1273"></span>[1274](#fn_1273.md) decorations, but that which
possesses the mighty power of the Spirit, and abounds with wisdom and
understanding. It needs not set phrases, but thoughts to give it
utterance, not skill in composition, but power of mind.

<span id="v.iii.xvi-p26"></span>[1 Tim.
5.19](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#019.md)<span
id="v.iii.xvi-p26.1"></span>. “Against an elder receive not an
accusation, but before two or three witnesses.”

<span id="v.iii.xvi-p27"></span>May we then receive an accusation
against a younger man, or against any one at all without witnesses?
Ought we not in all cases to come to our judgments with the greatest
exactness? What then does he mean? Do not so, he means, with any, but
especially in the case of an elder. For he speaks of an elder not with
respect to office, but to age, since the young more easily fall into sin
than their elders. And it is manifest from hence that the Church, and
even the whole people of Asia, had been now intrusted to Timothy, which
is the reason why he discourses with him concerning elders.

<span id="v.iii.xvi-p28"></span>[1 Tim.
5.20](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#020.md)<span
id="v.iii.xvi-p28.1"></span>. “Them that sin rebuke before all, that
others also may fear.”

<span id="v.iii.xvi-p29"></span>Do not, he says, hastily cut them off,
but carefully enquire into all the circumstances, and when thou hast
thoroughly informed thyself, then proceed against the offender with
rigor, that others may take warning. For as it is wrong to condemn
hastily and rashly, so not to punish manifest offenses is to open the
way to others, and embolden them to offend.

<span id="v.iii.xvi-p30"></span>“Rebuke,” he says, to show that it is
not to be done lightly, but with severity. For thus others will be
deterred. How is it then that Christ says, “Go and tell him his fault
between him and thee alone, if one sin against thee.” ([Matt. xviii.
15](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#015)<span id="v.iii.xvi-p30.1"></span>..md)
But Christ Himself permits him to be censured in the Church. What then?
is it not a greater scandal, that one should be rebuked before all? How
so? For it is a much greater scandal, that the offense should be known,
and not the punishment. For as when sinners go unpunished, many commit
crimes; so when they are punished, many are made better. God Himself
acted in this manner. He brought forth Pharaoh, and punished him openly.
And Nebuchadnezzar too, and many others, both cities and individuals, we
see visited with punishment. Paul therefore would have all stand in awe
of their Bishop, and sets him over all.

<span id="v.iii.xvi-p31"></span>And because many judgments are formed
upon suspicion, there ought, he says, to be witnesses, and men to
convict the offender according to the ancient law. “At the mouth of two
or three witnesses shall every matter be established. Against an elder
receive not an accusation.” ([Deut. xix.
15](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#015)<span id="v.iii.xvi-p31.1"></span>..md)
He does not say, “do not condemn,” but “receive not an accusation,”
bring him not to judgment at all. But what if the two witnesses are
false? This rarely happens, and it may be discovered upon examination on
the trial. For since offenses are committed in secret, we ought to be
satisfied with two witnesses, and this is sufficient proof of
investigation.

<span id="v.iii.xvi-p32"></span>But what if the offenses be notorious,
and yet there are no witnesses, only a strong suspicion? It has been
said above that he ought “to have a good report of them which are
without.” ([1 Tim. iii. 7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#007.md)<span
id="v.iii.xvi-p32.1"></span>.)

<span id="v.iii.xvi-p33"></span>Let us therefore love God with fear. The
law indeed is not made for a righteous man; but since the greater part
are virtuous from constraint rather than from choice, the principle of
fear is of great advantage to them in eradicating their desires. Let us
therefore listen to the threatenings of hell fire, that we may be
benefited by the wholesome fear of it. For if God, intending to cast
sinners into it, had not previously threatened them with it, many would
have plunged into it. For, if with this terror agitat<span
id="page_462">p. 462</span> <span id="v.iii.xvi-Page_462"></span>ing our
souls, some sin as readily as if there were no such thing in existence,
what enormities should we not have committed, if it had not been
declared and threatened? So that, as I have ever said, the threatenings
of hell show the care of God for us no less than the promises of heaven.
For the threat coöperates with the promise, and drives men into the
kingdom by means of terror. Let us not think it a matter of cruelty, but
of pity and mercy; of God’s concern and love for us. If in the days of
Jonah the destruction of Nineveh had not been threatened, that
destruction had not been averted. Nineveh would not have stood but for
the threat, “Nineveh shall be overthrown.” ([Jonah iii.
4](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#004)<span id="v.iii.xvi-p33.1"></span>..md)
And if hell had not been threatened, we should all have fallen into
hell. If the fire had not been denounced, no one would have escaped the
fire. God declares that He will do that which He desires not to do, that
He may do that which He desires to do. He willeth not the death of a
sinner, and therefore He threatens the sinner with death, that He may
not have to inflict death. And not only has He spoken the word, but He
has exhibited the thing itself, that we may escape it. And lest it
should be supposed to be a mere threat, He has manifested the reality of
it by what He has already done on earth. Dost thou not see in the flood
a symbol of hell, in that rain of all-destroying water an image of the
all-devouring fire? <span id="fr_1274"></span>[1275](#fn_1274.md) “For as
it was in the days of Noah,” He says, “they were marrying and giving in
marriage” ([Matt. xxiv. 38](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#038.md)<span
id="v.iii.xvi-p34.1"></span>.), so is it even now. It was then
predicted <span id="fr_1275"></span>[1276](#fn_1275.md) long before it took
place, and it is now predicted four hundred years or more
beforehand: <span id="fr_1276"></span>[1277](#fn_1276.md) but no one heeds
it. It is looked upon as a mere fable, as a matter of derision; no one
fears it, no one weeps or beats his breast at the thought of it. The
stream of fire is boiling up, the flame is kindled, and we are laughing,
taking our pleasure, and sinning without fear. No one even bears in mind
That Day. No one considers that present things are passing away, and
that they are but temporal, though events are every day crying out and
uttering a fearful voice. The untimely deaths, the changes that take
place in our lives, our own infirmities and diseases, fail to instruct
us. And not only in our own bodies are these changes visible, but in the
elements themselves. Every day in our different ages we experience a
kind of death, and in every case instability is the characteristic of
things we see. Neither winter, nor summer, nor spring, nor autumn, is
permanent; all are running, flying, and flowing past. Why should I speak
of fading flowers, of dignities, of kings that are to-day, and to-morrow
cease to be, of rich men, of magnificent houses, of night and day, of
the sun and the moon? for the moon wanes, and the sun is sometimes
eclipsed, and often darkened with clouds? Of things visible, in short,
is there anything that endures for ever? Nothing! No, nor anything in us
but the soul, and that we neglect. Of things subject to change we take
abundant care, as if they were permanent: but that which is to endure
for ever we neglect, as if it were soon to pass away. Some one is
enabled to perform mighty actions, but they shall last till to-morrow,
and then he perishes, as we see in the instances of those who have had
yet greater power, and are now to be seen no more. Life is a dream, and
a scene; and as on the stage when the scene is shifted the various
pageants disappear, and as dreams flit away when the sunbeams rise, so
here when the end comes, whether the universal or that of each one, all
is dissolved and vanishes away. The tree that you have planted remains,
and the house that you have built, it too stands on. But the planter and
the builder go away, and perish. Yet these things happen without our
regarding it, and we live on in luxury and pleasure, and are ever
furnishing ourselves with such things, as if we were immortal.

<span id="v.iii.xvi-p37"></span>Hear what Solomon says, who knew the
present world by actual experience. “I builded me houses, I planted me
vineyards, I made me gardens, and orchards and pools of water. I
gathered me also silver and gold. I gat myself men-singers, and
women-singers, and flocks, and herds.” ([Eccl.
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#004.md),
[5](../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#005)<span id="v.iii.xvi-p37.1"></span>..md)
There was no one who lived in greater luxury, or higher glory. There was
no one so wise or so powerful, no one who saw all things so succeeding
to his heart’s desire. What then? He had no enjoyment from all these
things. What after all does he say of it himself? “Vanity of vanities,
all is vanity.” ([Eccles. xii. 8](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#008.md)<span
id="v.iii.xvi-p37.2"></span>.) Vanity not simply but superlatively. Let
us believe him, and lay hold on that in which there is no vanity, in
which there is truth; and what is based upon a solid rock, where there
is no old age, nor decline, but all things bloom and flourish, without
decay, or waxing old, or approaching dissolution. Let us, I beseech you,
love God with genuine affection, not from fear of hell, but from desire
of the kingdom. For what is comparable to seeing Christ? Surely nothing!
What to the enjoyment of those good things? Surely nothing! Well may
there be nothing; for “eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have
entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for
them that love Him.” ([1 Cor. ii.
9](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#009)<span id="v.iii.xvi-p37.3"></span>..md)
Let us be anxious to <span id="page_463">p. 463</span> <span
id="v.iii.xvi-Page_463"></span>obtain those things, and let us despise
all these. Are we not continually complaining that human life is
nothing? Why art thou solicitous for what is nothing? Why dost thou
sustain such toils, for what is nothing? Thou seest splendid houses,
does the sight of them delude thee? Look up to heaven. Raise thy view
from pillars of stone to that beautiful fabric, compared with which the
others are as the works of ants and pismires. Learn philosophy from that
spectacle, ascend to heavenly things, and look thence upon our splendid
buildings, and see that they are nothing, the mere toys of little
children. Seest thou not how much finer, how much lighter, how much
purer, how much more translucent, is the air the higher thou ascendest?
There have they that do alms their mansions and their tabernacles. These
that are here are dissolved at the resurrection, or rather before the
resurrection destroyed by the stroke of time. Nay often in their most
flourishing state and period an earthquake overthrows, or fire entirely
ruins them. For not only the bodies of men, but their very buildings are
liable to untimely deaths. Nay, sometimes things decayed by time stand
firm under the shock of an earthquake, whilst glittering edifices,
firmly fixed, and newly constructed, are struck but by lightning and
perish. And this, I believe, is the interposition of God, that we may
not take pride in our buildings.

<span id="v.iii.xvi-p38"></span>Would you again have another ground for
cheerfulness? Go to the public buildings, in which you share equally
with others. For the most magnificent private houses, after all, are
less splendid than the public edifices. There you may remain, as long as
you please. They belong to you as much as to others, since they are
common to you with others; they are common, and not private. But those,
you say, delight you not. They delight you not, partly because you are
familiar with them, and partly from your covetousness. So the
pleasantness is not in the beauty, but in the appropriating! So the
pleasure is in greediness, and in the wish to make every man’s goods
your own! How long are we to be nailed to these things? How long are we
to be fastened to the earth, and grovel, like worms, in the dirt? God
hath given us a body of earth, that we might carry it with us up to
heaven, not that we should draw our soul down with it to earth. Earthy
it is, but if we please, it may be heavenly. See how highly God has
honored us, in committing to us so excellent a frame. I made heaven and
earth, He says, and to you I give the power of creation. Make your earth
heaven. For it is in thy power. “I am He that maketh and transformeth
all things” ([Amos v. 8](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#008.md)<span
id="v.iii.xvi-p38.1"></span>, Sept.), saith God of Himself. And He hath
given to men a similar power; as a painter, being an affectionate
father, teaches his own art to his son. I formed thy body beautiful, he
says, but I give thee the power of forming something better. Make thy
soul beautiful. I said, “Let the earth bring forth grass, and every
fruitful tree.” ([Gen. i. 11](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#011.md)<span
id="v.iii.xvi-p38.2"></span>.) Do thou also say, Let this earth <span
id="fr_1277"></span>[1278](#fn_1277.md) bring forth its proper fruit, and
what thou willest to produce will be produced. “I make the summer and
the cloud. I create the lightning and the wind.” ([Amos
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#013.md), [Ps.
74:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#017.md)<span
id="v.iii.xvi-p39.1"></span>.) I formed the dragon, that is, the
devil, <span id="fr_1278"></span>[1279](#fn_1278.md) to make sport with
him. ([Ps. civ. 26](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#026.md)<span
id="v.iii.xvi-p40.2"></span>.) Nor have I grudged thee the like power.
Thou, if thou wilt, canst sport with him, and bind him as thou wouldest
a sparrow. I make the sun to rise upon the evil and the good: do thou
imitate Me, by imparting of that is thine to the good and the evil. When
mocked I bear with it, and do good to those who mock Me: do thou imitate
Me, as thou canst. I do good, not to be requited; do thou imitate Me,
and do good, not to be repaid. I have lighted luminaries in the heavens.
Do thou light others brighter than these, for thou canst, by
enlightening those that are in error. For to know Me is a greater
benefit than to behold the sun. Thou canst not create a man, but thou
canst make him just and acceptable to God. I formed his substance, do
thou beautify his will. See how I love thee, and have given thee the
power in the greater things.

<span id="v.iii.xvi-p41"></span>Beloved, see how we are honored! yet
some are so unreasonable and so ungrateful as to say, “Why are we
endowed with free will?” But how in all the particulars which we have
mentioned could we have imitated God, if there had been no free will? I
rule Angels, He says, and so dost thou, through Him who is the
First-fruits. ([1 Cor. xv. 23](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#023.md)<span
id="v.iii.xvi-p41.1"></span>.) I sit on a royal throne, and thou art
seated with Me in Him who is the First-fruits. As it is said, “He hath
raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in
Christ Jesus.” ([Eph. ii. 6](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#006.md)<span
id="v.iii.xvi-p41.2"></span>.) Through Him who is the First-fruits,
Cherubim and Seraphim adore thee, with all the heavenly host,
principalities and powers, thrones and dominions. Disparage not thy
body, to which such high honors appertain, that the unbodied Powers
tremble at it.

<span id="v.iii.xvi-p42"></span>But what shall I say? It is not in this
way only that I have shown My love to thee, but by what I have suffered.
For thee I was spit upon, I was scourged. I emptied myself of glory, I
left My Father and came to thee, who dost hate Me, and turn from Me, and
art loath to hear My Name. I pursued thee, I ran after thee, that I
might overtake thee. I united and joined <span id="page_464">p.
464</span> <span id="v.iii.xvi-Page_464"></span>thee to myself, “eat Me,
drink Me,” I said. Above I hold thee, and below I embrace thee. Is it
not enough for thee that I have thy First-fruits above? Doth not this
satisfy thy affection? I descended below: I not only am mingled with
thee, I am entwined in thee. I am masticated, <span
id="fr_1279"></span>[1280](#fn_1279.md) broken into minute particles, that
the interspersion, <span id="fr_1280"></span>[1281](#fn_1280.md) and
commixture, and union may be more complete. Things united remain yet in
their own limits, but I am interwoven with thee. I would have no more
any division between us. I will that we both be one.

<span id="v.iii.xvi-p45"></span>Therefore knowing these things and
remembering His abundant care for us, let us do all things which may
prove us not unworthy of His great gift, which God grant that we may all
obtain, through the grace and lovingkindness of Christ Jesus our Lord,
with whom, &c.

<span id="v.iii.xvi-p9"></span> He seems to mean that a professed widow,
giving up her profession, is like woman betrothed to a man, and then
disliking him, and giving her affections to another.

<span id="fn_1268"></span>[459:1269](1130108.htm#fr_1268.md) <span

<span id="v.iii.xvi-p10"></span> i.e. by the profession of a devout
widowhood.

id="v.iii.xvi-p17.1"></span>

<span id="v.iii.xvi-p18"></span> Gr. fem. referring to the widows kept
by their relations, see Hom. xiii. and xiv., or perhaps to *women*
relieving them. See below, l. 9 of this page. Downes, missing the sense,
guesses it should be ἐκεῖνοι.

<span id="fn_1270"></span>[460:1271](1130108.htm#fr_1270.md) <span
id="v.iii.xvi-p20.3"></span>

<span id="v.iii.xvi-p21"></span> Colb. omits this clause; it is perhaps
too bold to guess τὰ ἀπὸ τῶν θυσίων, for χρυσίων, making it, “the share
of the sacrifices.”

his discourses.

id="v.iii.xvi-p33.2"></span>

<span id="v.iii.xvi-p34"></span> The construction is too involved for
such a passage; a slight change would refer the whole clause to the
Judgment, or to the destruction of the cities of the plain.

<span id="fn_1275"></span>[462:1276](1130108.htm#fr_1275.md) <span

Vulg. taking “formed” of his degradation.
