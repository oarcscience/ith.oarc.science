<span id="iv.v.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c10"><span
id="iv.v.iii-p1.1"></span>Homily III.</span>

<span id="iv.v.iii-p2"></span><span id="iv.v.iii-p2.1"></span><span
class="c1"><span id="iv.v.iii-p2.2"></span>[1 Thessalonians ii.
9-12](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#009.md)<span
id="iv.v.iii-p2.3"></span></span>

<span id="iv.v.iii-p3"></span>“For ye remember, brethren, our labor and
travail: for working night and day, that we might not burden any of you,
we preached unto you the Gospel of God. Ye are witnesses, and God also,
how holily and righteously and unblamably we behaved ourselves toward
you that believe: as ye know how we dealt with each one of you, as a
father with his own children, exhorting you, and encouraging you, and
testifying, to the end that ye should walk worthily of God, who calleth
you into His own kingdom and glory.”

<span id="iv.v.iii-p4"></span><span class="c13"><span
id="iv.v.iii-p4.1"></span>The</span> teacher ought to do nothing with a
feeling of being burdened, that tends to the salvation of his disciples.
For if the blessed Jacob was buffeted night and day in keeping his
flocks, much more ought he, to whom the care of souls is entrusted, to
endure all toils, though the work be laborious and mean, looking only to
one thing, the salvation of his disciples, and the glory thence arising
to God. See then, Paul, a man that was a Preacher, an Apostle of the
world, and raised to so great honor, worked with his hands that he might
not be burdensome to his disciples.

<span id="iv.v.iii-p5"></span>“For ye remember,” he says, “my brethren,
our labor and travail.” He had said previously, “we might have been
burdensome as the Apostles of Christ,” as he also says in the Epistle to
the Corinthians, “Know ye not that they which minister about sacred
things eat of the things of the Temple? Even so also did Christ ordain
that they which proclaim the Gospel should live of the Gospel.” ([1 Cor.
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#013.md),
[14](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#014)<span id="iv.v.iii-p5.1"></span>..md)
But I, he says, would not, but I labored; and he did not merely work,
but with much diligence. Observe then what he says; “For ye remember,”
he has not said, the benefits received from me, but, “our labor and
travail: for working night and day, that we might not burden any of you,
we preached unto you the Gospel of God.” And to the Corinthians he said
a different thing, “I robbed other Churches, taking wages of them that I
might minister unto you.” ([2 Cor. xi.
8](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#008)<span id="iv.v.iii-p5.2"></span>..md)
And yet even there he worked, but of this he made no mention, but urged
what was more striking, <span id="fr_957"></span>[958](#fn_957.md) as if he
had said, I was maintained by others when ministering to you. But here
it is not so. But what? “Working night and day.” And there indeed he
says, “And when I was present with you, and was in want, I was not a
burden on any man,” and, “I took wages that I might minister unto you.”
([2 Cor. 11:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#008.md),
[9](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#009)<span id="iv.v.iii-p6.1"></span>..md)
And here he shows that the men were in poverty, but there it was not so.

<span id="iv.v.iii-p7"></span>On this account he frequently addresses
them as witnesses. For “ye are witnesses,” he says, “and God also”; God
was worthy to be believed, but this other was that which most fully
assured them. For that indeed was uncertain to those who were ignorant
of it; but this was without doubt to all. For do not enquire whether it
was Paul who said these things. Much beyond what was necessary he gives
them assurance. Wherefore he says, “Ye are witnesses, and God also, how
holily and righteously and unblamably we behaved ourselves toward you
that believe.” It was proper to praise them again. On this account he
sets these things before them, which were sufficient to persuade them.
For he that stood there in want, and did not receive anything, would
much more not receive anything <span id="page_333">p. 333</span> <span
id="iv.v.iii-Page_333"></span>now. “How holily,” says he, “and
righteously and unblamably we behaved ourselves toward you that
believe.”

<span id="iv.v.iii-p8"></span>“As ye know how we exhorted and comforted
each one of you, as a father doth his own children.” Above having spoken
of his behavior here he speaks of his love, which was more than what
belonged to his rule over them. And what is said marks his freedom from
pride. “As a father his own children, exhorting you, and encouraging
you, and testifying, to the end that ye should walk worthily of God, who
calleth you into His own kingdom and glory.” When he says, “and
testifying,” then he makes mention of “fathers”; although we testified,
it was not violently, but like fathers. “Each one of you.” Strange! in
so great a multitude to omit no one, neither small nor great, neither
rich nor poor. “Exhorting” you, he says; to bear. “And comforting and
testifying.” “Exhorting,” <span id="fr_958"></span>[959](#fn_958.md)
therefore they did not seek glory; and “testifying,” therefore they did
not flatter. “That ye should walk worthily of God, who calleth you into
His own kingdom and glory.” Observe again, how, in relating, he both
teaches and comforts. For if He hath called them unto His kingdom, if He
called them unto glory, they ought to endure all things. We
“entreat” <span id="fr_959"></span>[960](#fn_959.md) you, not that you
should grant us any favor, but that you should gain the kingdom of
heaven.

<span id="iv.v.iii-p11"></span>[1 Thess.
2.13](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#013.md)<span id="iv.v.iii-p11.1"></span>.
“And for this cause we also thank God without ceasing, that when ye
received from us the word of the message, even the word of God, ye
accepted it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of
God, which also worketh in you that believe.”

<span id="iv.v.iii-p12"></span>It cannot be said, he says, that we
indeed do all things unblamably, but you on the other hand have done
things unworthy of our course of life. For in hearing us, you gave such
heed as if not hearing men, but as if God Himself were exhorting you.
Whence is this manifest? Because as he shows from his own temptations
and their testimony, and the way in which he acted, that he did not
preach with flattery or vainglory; so from their trials, he shows also
that they rightly received the word. For whence, he says, unless ye had
heard as if God were speaking, did ye endure such perils? And observe
his dignity.

<span id="iv.v.iii-p13"></span>[1 Thess.
2.14-16](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#014.md)<span
id="iv.v.iii-p13.1"></span>. “For ye, brethren, became imitators of the
Churches of God, which are in Judæa in Christ Jesus: for ye also
suffered the same things of your own countrymen, even as they did of the
Jews; who both killed the Lord Jesus and their own prophets, and drave
out us, and please not God, and are contrary to all men; forbidding us
to speak to the Gentiles that they may be saved; to fill up their sins
alway: but the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost.”

<span id="iv.v.iii-p14"></span>“For ye,” he says, “became imitators of
the Churches of God which are in Judæa.” This is a great consolation. It
is no wonder, he says, that they should do these things to you, inasmuch
as they have done it also to their own countrymen. And this too is no
little proof that the Preaching is true, that even Jews were able to
endure all things. “For ye also,” he says, “have suffered the same
things of your own countrymen, even as they did of the Jews.” There is
something more in his saying, “as they also did in Judæa”; it shows that
everywhere they rejoiced, as having nobly contended. He says therefore,
“that ye also suffered the same things.” And again, what wonder is it,
if to you also, when even to the Lord they dared do such things?

<span id="iv.v.iii-p15"></span>Do you see how he introduces this as
containing great consolation? And constantly he adverts to it; and upon
a close examination one may find it in nearly all his Epistles, how
variously, <span id="fr_960"></span>[961](#fn_960.md) upon all occasions of
temptation, he brings forward Christ. Observe accordingly, that here
also, when accusing the Jews, he puts them in mind of the Lord, and of
the sufferings of the Lord; so well does he know that this is a matter
of the greatest consolation.

<span id="iv.v.iii-p17"></span>“Who both killed the Lord,” he says—but,
perhaps, they did not know Him,—assuredly they did know Him. What then?
Did they not slay and stone their own prophets, whose books even they
carry about with them? And they did not do this for the sake of truth.
There is therefore not only a consolation under the temptations, but
they are reminded not to think that (the Jews) did it for the truth’s
sake, and be troubled on that account. “And drave out us,” <span
id="fr_961"></span>[962](#fn_961.md) he says. And we also, he says, have
suffered numberless evils. “And please not God, and are contrary to all
men; forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles, that they may be saved.”
“Contrary to all men,” he says. How? Because if we ought to speak to the
world, and they forbid us, they are the common enemies of the world.
They have slain Christ and the prophets, they insult God, they are the
common enemies of the world, they banish us, when coming for their
salvation. What wonder if they have done such things also to you, when
they have done them even in Judæa? “Forbidding us to speak to the
Gentiles, that they might be saved.” It is a mark of envy therefore to
hinder the salvation of all. “To fill up their sins alway. But the wrath
is come upon them to the uttermost.” <span id="page_334">p. 334</span>
<span id="iv.v.iii-Page_334"></span>What is “to the uttermost”? These
things are no longer like the former. There is here no return back, no
limit. But the wrath is nigh at hand. Whence is this manifest? From that
which Christ foretold. For not only is it a consolation to have
partakers in our afflictions, but to hear also that our persecutors are
to be punished. And if the delay is a grievance, let it be a consolation
that they will never lift up their heads again; or rather he hath cut
short the delay, by saying, “THE wrath,” showing that it was long ago
due, and predetermined, and predicted.

<span id="iv.v.iii-p19"></span>[1 Thess.
2.17](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#017.md)<span id="iv.v.iii-p19.1"></span>.
“But we, being taken from you <span id="fr_962"></span>[963](#fn_962.md)
for a short time in presence, not in heart, endeavored the more
abundantly to see your face with great desire.”

<span id="iv.v.iii-p21"></span>He has not said “separated,” but what was
much more. <span id="fr_963"></span>[964](#fn_963.md) He had spoken above
of flattery, showing that he did not flatter, that he did not seek
glory. He speaks here concerning love. Because he had said above, “as a
father his children,” “as a nurse,” here he uses another expression,
“being made orphans,” which is said of children who have lost their
fathers. And yet they <span id="fr_964"></span>[965](#fn_964.md) were made
orphans. “No”—he says—“but we. For if any one should examine our
longing, even as little children without a protector, having sustained
an untimely bereavement, long for their parents, not only from the
feelings of nature itself, but also on account of their deserted state,
so truly do we too feel.” From this also he shows his own despondency on
account of their separation. And this we cannot say, he says, that we
have waited a long period, but “for a short time,” and that “in
presence, not in heart.” For we always have you in our mind. See how
great is his love! Although having them always in his heart, he sought
also their presence face to face. Tell me not of your superlative <span
id="fr_965"></span>[966](#fn_965.md) philosophy! This is truly fervent
love; both to see, and to hear, and speak; and this may be of much
advantage. “We endeavored the more exceedingly.” What is “more
exceedingly”? He either means to say, “we are vehemently attached to
you,” or, “as was likely, being bereaved for a season, we endeavored to
see your face.” Observe the blessed Paul. When of himself he cannot
satisfy his longing, he does it through others, as when he sends Timothy
to the Philippians, and the same person again to the Corinthians,
holding intercourse with them through others, when he cannot of himself.
For in loving them, he was like some mad person, not to be restrained,
nor to command himself in his affection.

<span id="iv.v.iii-p25"></span>[1 Thess.
2.18](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#018.md)<span id="iv.v.iii-p25.1"></span>.
“Wherefore we would fain have come unto you.”

<span id="iv.v.iii-p26"></span>Which is the part of love; yet here he
mentions no other necessity but “that we might see you.” “I Paul once
and again, and Satan hindered us.”

<span id="iv.v.iii-p27"></span>What sayest thou? does Satan hinder? Yes,
truly, for this was not the work of God. For in the Epistle to the
Romans, he says this, that God hindered him (from [Rom. xv.
22](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#022)<span id="iv.v.iii-p27.1"></span>..md);
and elsewhere Luke says, that “the Spirit” hindered them from going into
Asia. ([Acts xvi. 7](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#007.md)<span
id="iv.v.iii-p27.2"></span>.) And in the Epistle to the Corinthians he
says, that it is the work of the Spirit, but here only of Satan. But
what hindrance of Satan is he speaking of? Some unexpected and violent
temptations: <span id="fr_966"></span>[967](#fn_966.md) for a plot, it
says, being formed against him by the Jews, he was detained three months
in Greece. But it is another thing to remain for the sake of the
dispensation, and willingly. For there he says, “Wherefore having no
more place in these parts” ([Rom. xv.
23](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#023)<span id="iv.v.iii-p28.2"></span>..md),
and, “To spare you I forbare to come unto Corinth.” ([2 Cor. i.
23](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#023)<span id="iv.v.iii-p28.3"></span>..md)
But here nothing of this sort. But what? That “Satan hindered” him.
“Even I Paul,” he says, “both once and again.” Observe, how ambitious he
is, and what a display he makes, in his willingness to show that he
loved them most of all. “I Paul,” he says, instead of Although no
others. For they indeed were only willing, but I even attempted it.

<span id="iv.v.iii-p29"></span>[1 Thess.
2.19](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#019.md)<span id="iv.v.iii-p29.1"></span>.
“For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of glorying? Are not even ye
before our Lord Jesus at His coming?”

<span id="iv.v.iii-p30"></span>Are the Macedonians, tell me, thy hope, O
blessed Paul? Not these alone, he says. Therefore he has added, “Are not
ye also?” For “what,” he says, “is our hope, or joy, or crown of
glorying”? Observe then the words, which are those of women, inflamed
with tenderness, talking to their little children. “And crown of
glorying,” he says. For the name of “crown” was not sufficient to
express the splendor, but also “of glorying.” Of what fiery warmth is
this! Never could either mother, or father, yea if they even met
together, and commingled their love, have shown their own affection to
be equivalent to that of Paul. “My joy and crown,” he says, that is, I
rejoice in you more than in a crown. For consider how great a thing it
is, that an entire Church should be present, planted and rooted by Paul.
Who would not rejoice in such a multitude of children, and in the
goodness of those children? So that this also is not <span
id="page_335">p. 335</span> <span
id="iv.v.iii-Page_335"></span>flattery. For he has not said “ye,” but
“ye also” <span id="fr_967"></span>[968](#fn_967.md) together with the
others.

<span id="iv.v.iii-p32"></span>[1 Thess.
2.20](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#020.md)<span id="iv.v.iii-p32.1"></span>.
“For ye are our glory and our joy.”

<span id="iv.v.iii-p33"></span>[1 Thess.
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#001.md),
[2](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#002.md)<span id="iv.v.iii-p33.1"></span>.
“Wherefore, when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be
left behind at Athens alone.” Instead of saying, “we chose.” “And sent
Timothy, our brother and God’s minister and our fellow-worker in the
Gospel of Christ.”

<span id="iv.v.iii-p34"></span>And this he says, not as extolling
Timothy, but honoring them, that he sent them the fellow-worker, and
minister of the Gospel. As if he had said, Having withdrawn him from his
labors we have sent to you the minister of God, and our fellow-laborer
in the Gospel of Christ.

<span id="iv.v.iii-p35"></span>“To establish you, and to comfort you
concerning your faith.”

<span id="iv.v.iii-p36"></span>[1 Thess.
3.3](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#003.md)<span id="iv.v.iii-p36.1"></span>.
“That no man be moved by these afflictions.”

<span id="iv.v.iii-p37"></span>What then does he say here? Because the
temptations of the teachers trouble their disciples, and he had then
fallen into many temptations, as also he himself says, that “Satan
hindered us,” always saying this; “both once,” he says, “and again I
would have come to you,” and was not able, which was a proof of great
violence. And it was reasonable that this should trouble them, for they
are not so much troubled at their own temptations, as at those of their
teachers; as neither is the soldier so much troubled at his own
trials, <span id="fr_968"></span>[969](#fn_968.md) as when he sees his
general wounded. “To establish you,” he says; not that they were at all
deficient in faith, nor that they required to learn anything.

<span id="iv.v.iii-p39"></span>“And to comfort you concerning your
faith; that no man be moved by these afflictions; for yourselves know
that hereunto we are appointed.”

<span id="iv.v.iii-p40"></span>[1 Thess.
3.4](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#004.md)<span id="iv.v.iii-p40.1"></span>.
“For verily, when we were with you, we told you beforehand that we are
to suffer affliction; even as it came to pass, and ye know.”

<span id="iv.v.iii-p41"></span>Ye ought not, he says, to be troubled,
for nothing strange, nothing contrary to expectation is happening; which
was sufficient to raise them up. For do you see that on this account
also Christ foretold to His disciples? For hear Him saying, “Now I have
told you before it came to pass, that when it is come to pass ye may
believe.” ([John xiv. 29](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#029.md)<span
id="iv.v.iii-p41.1"></span>.) For greatly indeed, greatly does it tend
to the comfort of others, to have heard from their teachers what is to
happen. For as he that is sick, if he hear from his physician that this
or that is taking place, is not much troubled; but if anything happen
unexpectedly, as if he too were at a loss, and the disorder was beyond
his art, he is afflicted and troubled; so also is it here. Which Paul
foreknowing, foretold to them, “we are about to be afflicted,” “as it
came to pass, and ye know.” He not only says that this came to pass, but
that he foretold many things, and they happened. “Hereunto we are
appointed.” So that not only ye ought not to be troubled and disturbed
about the past, but not even about the future, if any such thing should
happen, “for hereunto we are appointed.”

<span id="iv.v.iii-p42"></span><span class="c13"><span
id="iv.v.iii-p42.1"></span>Moral</span>. Let us hear, who have ears to
hear. The Christian is appointed hereunto. For concerning all the
faithful is this said, “Hereunto we are appointed.” And we, as if we
were appointed <span id="fr_969"></span>[970](#fn_969.md) for ease, think
it strange if we suffer anything; and yet what reason have we for
thinking anything strange? For no season of affliction or temptation has
overtaken us, but what is common to man. It is a fit season for us to
say to you, “Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin”
([Heb. xii. 4](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#004.md)<span
id="iv.v.iii-p43.1"></span>.). Or rather, this is not seasonable for us
to say to you—but what? Ye have not yet despised riches. For to them
indeed these words were said with reason, when they had lost all their
own possessions, <span id="fr_970"></span>[971](#fn_970.md) but this is
said to those who retain theirs. Who has been robbed of his riches for
Christ’s sake? Who has been beaten? Who has been insulted? even in
words, I mean. What have you to boast of? What confidence have you to
say anything? So many things Christ suffered for us when we were
enemies. What can we show that we have suffered for Him? Nothing that we
have suffered indeed, but infinite good things that we have received
from Him. Whence shall we have confidence in that Day? Know ye not, that
the soldier too, when he can show numberless wounds and scars, will then
be able to shine in the presence of the king? But if he has no good
action to show, though he may have done no harm, he will take rank among
the least.

<span id="iv.v.iii-p45"></span>But, you say, it is not the season of
war. But if it was, tell me, who would contend? Who would attack? Who
would break through <span id="fr_971"></span>[972](#fn_971.md) the phalanx?
Perhaps no one. For when I see that you do not despise riches for the
sake of Christ, how shall I believe that you will despise blows? Tell
me, do you bear manfully those who insult you, and do you bless them?
You do not—but you disobey. What is attended with no danger, you do not;
and will you endure blows, in which there is much pain and suffering?
Know ye not that it is proper in peace to keep up the exercises of
war? <span id="fr_972"></span>[973](#fn_972.md) Do you not <span
id="page_336">p. 336</span> <span id="iv.v.iii-Page_336"></span>see
these <span id="fr_973"></span>[974](#fn_973.md) soldiers, who though no
war disturbs them, but it is profound peace, brightening up their arms,
and going forth with the teachers who teach them tactics, into the broad
and level plains, I may say, every day, keep up with the greatest
strictness the exercises of war? Of our spiritual soldiers, who has done
this? No one. For this reason we become in war weak and ignoble, and
easily led captive by any.

<span id="iv.v.iii-p49"></span>But what stupidity is this, not to think
the present a season of war, when Paul is crying out, “Yea, and all that
would live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution” ([2 Tim. iii.
12](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#012)<span id="iv.v.iii-p49.1"></span>..md);
and Christ says, “In the world ye shall have tribulation.” ([John xvi.
33](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#033)<span id="iv.v.iii-p49.2"></span>..md)
And again the blessed Paul with a loud voice cries out, saying, “Our
wrestling is not against flesh and blood,” and again, “Stand therefore,
having girded your loins with truth.” ([Eph.
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#012.md),
[14](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#014)<span id="iv.v.iii-p49.3"></span>..md)
Why dost thou arm us, tell me, when it is not war? Why dost thou give us
trouble to no purpose? Thou puttest breastplates on the soldiers, when
it is allowed them to rest and revive. But he would have said,
Certainly, however, though it were not war, it would be right to attend
to the concerns of war. For he who in peace considers the business of
battle, will be formidable in the season of battle; but he who is
without experience in the things of war, will be more troubled even in
peace. Why so? Because he will weep for the things which he possesses,
and not being able to fight for them, will be in anguish. For the
possessions of the cowardly and inexperienced and ignoble in war, are
the property of all who are brave and warlike. So that on this account
first I arm you. But then also the whole time of our life is the season
of war. How and in what respect? The devil is ever at hand. Hear what it
says, “As a roaring lion, he walketh about, seeking whom he may devour.”
([1 Pet. v. 8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#008.md)<span
id="iv.v.iii-p49.4"></span>.) Numberless bodily affections assail us,
which it is necessary to enumerate, that we may not vainly deceive
ourselves. For tell me, what does not war against us? Riches, beauty,
pleasure, power, authority, envy, glory, pride? For not only does our
own glory war against us, forbidding us to descend to humility; but the
glory of others also, leading us to envy and ill-nature. But what do
their opposites, poverty, dishonor, the being despised, rejected, the
having no power? These things indeed are in us. But from men proceed
wickedness, plots, deceits, slanders, assaults innumerable. In like
manner on the part of the demons, “principalities, powers, the
world-rulers of this darkness, spiritual hosts of wickedness.” Some of
us are rejoicing, others grieving, both are deviations from the right
course. But health and sickness (war against us). From what quarter will
not man be falling into sin? Would you that I should tell you from the
beginning, commencing even immediately from Adam? What took captive the
first created? Pleasure, and eating, and the love of dominion. What the
son who came next after him? Grudging and envy. What those in the time
of Noah? Fleshly pleasures, and the evils issuing from them. What his
son? Insolence and irreverence. What the Sodomites? Insolence,
wantonness; and fullness of bread. But often even poverty has this
effect. On this account a certain wise man said, “Give me neither
poverty nor riches.” ([Prov. xxx.
8](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#008)<span id="iv.v.iii-p49.5"></span>..md)
However it is neither poverty nor riches, but the will that cannot use
either of them. “Acknowledge,” he says, “that thou passest through the
midst of snares.” ([Ecclesiasticus
9.13](../../../bib/apo/sir009.htm#013.md)<span
id="iv.v.iii-p49.6"></span>.)

<span id="iv.v.iii-p50"></span>The blessed Paul has admirably said,
“Hereunto we are appointed.” He has not said merely, that we are
tempted, but that “hereunto we are appointed,” as if he had said, For
this were we born. This is our business, this our life, and dost thou
seek rest? The executioner does not stand over us, lacerating our sides,
and compelling us to sacrifice; but the desire of riches, and of
possessing more, is instant, tearing out our eyes. No soldier has
kindled a pile, nor placed us on a gridiron, <span
id="fr_974"></span>[975](#fn_974.md) but more than this, the flames of the
flesh set fire on our souls. No king is present promising numberless
bounties, and putting us out of countenance. But there is present a rage
for glory, tickling us worse than he. A great war, truly, exceedingly
great, if we would watch.

<span id="iv.v.iii-p52"></span>And the present season too has its
crowns. Hear Paul saying, “Henceforth there is laid up for me the crown
of righteousness, which the righteous Judge shall give me…and not only
to me, but also to all them that have loved His appearing.” ([2 Tim. iv.
8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#008)<span id="iv.v.iii-p52.1"></span>..md)
When thou hast lost a beloved and only son, whom thou wert bringing up
in much wealth, displaying good hopes, himself being the only one to
succeed to thine inheritance; do not complain, but give thanks to God,
and glorify Him who has taken him, and in this respect thou wilt not be
worse than Abraham. For as he gave him to God, when he commanded it, so
thou hast not complained, when He has taken him. Hast thou fallen into a
severe sickness, and do many come, constraining thee, some with charms,
some with amulets, and others with other things, to remedy the evil? and
hast thou borne it firmly and unflinchingly from the fear of God, and
wouldst thou have chosen to suffer all things rather than submit to do
any of those idolatrous practices? <span id="page_337">p. 337</span>
<span id="iv.v.iii-Page_337"></span>This brings to thee the crown of
martyrdom. Doubt it not. And how and by what means, I will tell thee.
For as such an one bears firmly the pains of torture, so as not to
worship the image, so thou also bearest the sufferings of thy disease,
so as to want nothing of those remedies which the other offers, nor to
do the things which he prescribes. “But those pains are more
violent”—yes, but these are of longer duration, so that it is the same
in the end; nay often these are more violent too. For tell me, when
fever is raging and burning within, and thou rejectest the charm that
others recommend to thee, hast thou not bound on thee the crown of
martyrdom?

<span id="iv.v.iii-p53"></span>Again, has any one lost money? many
advise thee to have recourse to diviners; but thou, from fear of God,
because it is forbidden, choosest rather not to receive thy money than
to disobey God—thou hast a reward equal to him who has given it to the
poor, if having lost, thou givest thanks, and when able to have recourse
to diviners, thou bearest not to receive, rather than so to receive it.
For as he from the fear of God has given all to the needy, so thou also
from fear of God, when they have plundered thee, hast not recovered it.

<span id="iv.v.iii-p54"></span>We are the masters of injuring or not
injuring ourselves. And if you will, let us make the whole matter plain
in the case of theft itself. The thief has cut through the wall, he has
rushed into the chamber, he has carried off costly golden vessels, and
precious stones, in short, he has cleared thy whole treasure, and has
not been taken. The fact is grievous, and it seems to be a loss; still
as yet it is not so but it depends on thee to make it either a loss or a
gain. And how, sayest thou, can this be a gain? I will endeavor to show
thee how, if thou art willing, it will be a great gain, but if
unwilling, the loss will be severer than that which has taken place. For
as in the case of artificers, when material is before them, he who is
skilled in his art uses it to good purpose, but he that is unskillful
spoils it, and makes it a loss to him, so also in these matters. How
then will it be a gain? If thou givest thanks to God, if thou dost not
wail bitterly, if thou utterest the words of Job, “The Lord gave and the
Lord hath taken away. Naked came I out of my mother’s womb, naked shall
I also go away.” ([Job i. 21](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#021.md)<span
id="iv.v.iii-p54.1"></span>, Sept.)

<span id="iv.v.iii-p55"></span>“What?” sayest thou, “the Lord hath taken
away? The thief hath taken away, and how canst thou say, the Lord hath
taken away?” Wonder not, for even Job, of things which the devil took
away, said, These the Lord hath taken away? And shalt not thou say of
what the thief took, The Lord hath taken away? Tell me, whom dost thou
admire? him who has bestowed all his goods upon the poor, or Job for
these words? Is he, who did not then give, inferior to him, who has
given alms? For say not, “I feel no thankfulness. The matter was not
done with my consent, or knowledge, or will. The robber took it. What
will be my reward?” Neither did these things happen with Job’s knowledge
or will. For how could it be? Nevertheless, he wrestled. <span
id="fr_975"></span>[976](#fn_975.md)

<span id="iv.v.iii-p57"></span>And it is in thy power to receive as
great a reward, as if thou hadst cast it away willingly. And perhaps we
admire this man more, who thankfully suffers wrongs, than him who gives
spontaneously. And why? Because the latter indeed is fed with praises,
and supported by conscience, and has good hopes; and having before <span
id="fr_976"></span>[977](#fn_976.md) borne manfully the privation of his
goods, he then cast them away; but the former, whilst yet bound to them,
was forcibly deprived of them. And it is not the same thing, having
first been induced to part with riches, in that way to bestow them, as
it is while yet longing to be deprived of them. If thou wilt say these
words, thou wilt receive many times as much, and even more than Job. For
he received twice as much here, but to thee Christ has promised a
hundred fold. From the fear of God, thou hast not blasphemed? thou hast
not had recourse to diviners? suffering wrong, thou hast been thankful?
Thou art like one who despises wealth, for thou couldest not do this,
hadst thou not first despised it. And it is not the same thing in a long
time to practice the contempt of riches, and all at once to bear a loss
that has happened. Thus the loss becomes gain, and thou wilt not be
injured, but even benefited by the devil.

<span id="iv.v.iii-p59"></span>But how does the loss also become
grievous? When thou losest thy soul! Tell me, the thief has deprived
thee of thy possessions: wilt thou deprive thyself of salvation?
Wherefore, grieving at the evils which thou hast suffered from others,
dost thou plunge thyself into more evils? He perhaps has involved thee
in poverty: but thou perversely injurest thyself in things that are
fatal. He hath deprived thee of things that are without thee, and that
hereafter would spring away from thee even against thy will. But thou
deprivest thyself of the eternal riches. The devil hath grieved thee by
taking away thy wealth; do thou also grieve him, and do not delight him.
If thou hast recourse to diviners, thou delightest him. If thou
renderest thanks to God, thou givest him his death-blow.

<span id="iv.v.iii-p60"></span>And see what happens. Thou wilt not still
find it, if thou goest to the diviners, for it is not in their power to
know; and even if by any chance they have told thee, thou both losest
thy <span id="page_338">p. 338</span> <span
id="iv.v.iii-Page_338"></span>own soul besides, and thou wilt be derided
by thy brethren, and again wilt lose it wretchedly. For the demon,
knowing that thou canst not bear thy loss, but for the sake of these
things deniest even thy God, again gives thee wealth, that he may have
an opportunity of deceiving thee again, and making thee fall away. And
if the diviners should tell thee, wonder not. The demon is without body:
he is everywhere going about. It is he who arms the robbers themselves.
For these things do not take place without the demon. If therefore he
arms them, he knows also where it is deposited. He is not ignorant of
his own ministers. And this is not wonderful. If he sees thee grieving
at the loss, he adds yet another to it. If he sees thee laughing at it,
and despising it, he will desist from this course. For as we deal to our
enemies those things by which we grieve them, but if we see that they do
not grieve, we henceforth desist, as being unable to plague them; so
does the devil also.

<span id="iv.v.iii-p61"></span>What sayest thou? Dost thou not see those
who sail on the sea, how, when a storm arises, they regard not their
wealth, but even throw overboard their substance? “O man, what dost thou
say? Art thou coöperating with the storm and the shipwreck? Before the
wave has taken away thy wealth, dost thou do it with thine own hands?
Why, before the shipwreck, dost thou wreck thyself?” But indeed a rustic
inexperienced in the trials of the sea might say this. But the naval
man, and one who truly knows what are the causes of calm, and what of
storm, will even laugh at him who talks thus. For I throw it overboard,
he says, that there may be no whelming sea. <span
id="fr_977"></span>[978](#fn_977.md) So he who is experienced in the events
and trials of life, when he sees the storm impending, and the spirits of
evil wishing to cause shipwreck, throws overboard even the remainder of
his wealth. Hast thou been plundered? Do alms, and thou lightenest the
ship. Have robbers ravaged thee? Give what remains to Christ. So thou
wilt console thy poverty from thy former loss. Lighten the ship, do not
hold fast what remains, lest the vessel fill with water. They, to
preserve their bodies, throw their goods overboard, and wait not for the
assailing wave to overturn the vessel. And wilt thou not stay the
shipwreck, that thou mayest save souls?

<span id="iv.v.iii-p63"></span>Make the trial, I beseech you—if you
disbelieve, make the trial, and you will see the glory of God. When
anything grievous has happened, immediately give alms; render thanks
that it has happened, and thou wilt see how much joy will come upon
thee. For spiritual gain, though it be small, is so great as to throw
into the shade all bodily loss. As long as thou hast to give to Christ,
thou art rich. Tell me, if when thou wast robbed, the king coming to
thee held out his hand, begging to receive something from thee, wouldest
thou not then think thyself richer than all, if the king not even after
so great poverty was ashamed of thee? Be not carried away with thy
wealth, only overcome thyself, and thou wilt overcome the assault of the
devil. It is in thy power to acquire great gain.

<span id="iv.v.iii-p64"></span>Let us despise wealth, that we may not
despise the soul. But how can any one despise it? Dost thou not see in
the case of beautiful bodies, and the lovers of them, how as long as
they are in their sight the fire is kindled, the flame rises bright; but
when any one has removed them afar off, all is extinguished, all is
lulled to sleep; so also in the case of wealth, let no one provide gold,
nor precious stones, nor necklaces; when seen, they ensnare the eyes.
But if thou wouldest be rich like the ancients, be rich not in gold, but
in necessary things, that thou mayest bestow on others from that which
thou hast ready. Be not fond of ornament. Such wealth is both easy to be
plotted against by robbers, and a thing that brings us cares. Not
vessels of gold and silver, but let there be stores of bread and wine
and oil, not that being sold again they may procure money, but that they
may be supplied to those who need. If we withdraw ourselves from those
superfluities, we shall obtain the heavenly goods; which God grant that
we may all obtain, in Jesus Christ our Lord, with whom, &c.
