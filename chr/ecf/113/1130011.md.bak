id="iii.iii.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter VI.</span>

<span id="iii.iii.vi-p2"></span>[Gal.
6.1](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#001.md)<span id="iii.iii.vi-p2.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iii.vi-p3"></span>*“Brethren,* <span
id="fr_144"></span>[145](#fn_144.md) *even if a man be overtaken in any
trespass.”* <span id="fr_145"></span>[146](#fn_145.md)

<span id="iii.iii.vi-p6"></span><span class="c13"><span
id="iii.iii.vi-p6.1"></span>Forasmuch</span> as under cover of a rebuke
they gratified their private feelings, and professing to do so for
faults which had been committed, were advancing their own ambition, he
says, “Brethren, if a man be overtaken.” He said not if a man commit but
if he be “overtaken” that is, if he be carried away. <span
id="fr_146"></span>[147](#fn_146.md)

<span id="iii.iii.vi-p8"></span>“Ye which are spiritual <span
id="fr_147"></span>[148](#fn_147.md) restore such a one,”

<span id="iii.iii.vi-p10"></span>He says not “chastise” nor “judge,” but
“set right.” Nor does he stop here, but in order to show that it behoved
them to be very gentle towards those who had lost their footing, he
subjoins,

<span id="iii.iii.vi-p11"></span>“In a spirit of meekness.”

<span id="iii.iii.vi-p12"></span>He says not, “in meekness,” but, “in a
spirit of meekness,” signifying thereby that this is acceptable to the
Spirit, and that to be able to administer correction with mildness is a
spiritual gift. Then, to prevent the one being unduly exalted by having
to correct the other, puts him under the same fear, saying,

<span id="iii.iii.vi-p13"></span>“Looking to thyself, lest thou also be
tempted.”

<span id="iii.iii.vi-p14"></span>For as rich men convey contributions to
the indigent, that in case they should be themselves involved in poverty
they may receive the same bounty, so ought we also to do. And therefore
he states this cogent reason, in these words, “looking to thyself, lest
thou also be tempted.” He apologizes for the offender, first, by saying
“if ye be overtaken;” next, by employing a term indicative of great
infirmity <span id="fr_148"></span>[149](#fn_148.md) ; lastly, by the words
“lest thou also be tempted,” thus arraigning the malice of the devil
rather than the remissness of the soul.

<span id="iii.iii.vi-p16"></span>[Gal.
6.2](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#002.md)<span
id="iii.iii.vi-p16.1"></span>. “Bear ye one another’s burdens.”

<span id="iii.iii.vi-p17"></span>It being impossible for man to be
without failings, he exhorts them not to scrutinize severely the
offences of others, but even to bear their failings, that their own may
in turn be borne by others. As, in the building of a house, all the
stones hold not the same position, but one is fitted for a corner but
not for the foundations, another for the foundations, and not for the
corner so too is it in the body of the Church. The same thing holds in
the frame of our own flesh; notwithstanding which, the one member bears
with the other, and we do not require every thing from each, but what
each contributes in common constitutes both the body and the building.

<span id="iii.iii.vi-p18"></span>[Gal.
6.2](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#002.md)<span
id="iii.iii.vi-p18.1"></span>. “And so fulfil the law of Christ.”

<span id="iii.iii.vi-p19"></span>He says not “fulfil,” but,
“complete <span id="fr_149"></span>[150](#fn_149.md) ;” that is, make it up
all of you in common, <span id="fr_150"></span>[151](#fn_150.md) by the
things wherein ye bear with one another. For example, this man is
irascible, thou art dull-tempered; bear therefore with his vehemence
that he in turn may bear with thy sluggishness; and thus neither will he
transgress, being supported by thee, nor wilt thou offend in the points
where thy defects lie, because of thy brother’s forbearing with thee. So
do ye by reaching forth a hand one to another when about to fall, fulfil
the Law in common, each completing what is wanting in his neighbor by
his own endurance. But if ye do not thus, but each of you will
investigate the faults of his neighbor, nothing will ever be performed
by you as it ought. For as in the case of the body, if one were to exact
the same function from every member of it, the body could never consist,
so must there be great strife among brethren if we were to require all
things from all.

<span id="iii.iii.vi-p23"></span>[Gal.
6.3](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#003.md)<span
id="iii.iii.vi-p23.1"></span>. “For if a man thinketh himself to be
something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.”

<span id="iii.iii.vi-p24"></span><span id="page_44">p. 44</span> <span
id="iii.iii.vi-Page_44"></span>Here again he reflects on their
arrogance. He that thinks himself to be something is nothing, and
exhibits at the outset a proof of his worthlessness by such a
disposition.

<span id="iii.iii.vi-p25"></span>[Gal.
6.4](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#004.md)<span
id="iii.iii.vi-p25.1"></span>. “But let each man prove his own work.”

<span id="iii.iii.vi-p26"></span>Here he shows that we ought to be
scrutinizers of our lives, and this not lightly, but carefully to weigh
our actions; as for example, if thou hast performed a good deed,
consider whether it was not from vain glory, or through necessity, or
malevolence, or with hypocrisy, or from some other human motive. For as
gold appears to be bright before it is placed in the furnace, but when
committed to the fire, is closely proved, and all that is spurious is
separated from what is genuine, so too our works, if closely examined,
will be distinctly made manifest, and we shall perceive that we have
exposed ourselves to much censure.

<span id="iii.iii.vi-p27"></span>[Gal.
6.4](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#004.md)<span
id="iii.iii.vi-p27.1"></span>. “And then shall he have his glorying in
regard of himself alone and not of his neighbor.”

<span id="iii.iii.vi-p28"></span>This he says, not as laying down a
rule, but in the way of concession; and his meaning is this, <span
id="fr_151"></span>[152](#fn_151.md) —Boasting is senseless, but if thou
wilt boast, boast not against thy neighbor, as the Pharisee did. For he
that is so instructed will speedily give up boasting altogether; and
therefore he concedes a part that he may gradually extirpate the whole.
He that is wont to boast with reference to himself only, and not against
others, will soon reform this failing also. For he that does not
consider himself better than others, for this is the meaning of “not in
regard of his neighbor,” but becomes elated by examining himself by
himself, will afterwards cease to be so. And that you may be sure this
is what he desires to establish, observe how he checks him by fear,
saying above, “let every man prove his own work,” and adding here,

<span id="iii.iii.vi-p30"></span>[Gal.
6.5](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#005.md)<span
id="iii.iii.vi-p30.1"></span>. “For each man shall bear his own burden.”

<span id="iii.iii.vi-p31"></span>He appears to state a reason
prohibitory of boasting against another; but at the same time he
corrects the boaster, to that he may no more entertain high thoughts of
himself by bringing to his remembrance his own errors, and pressing upon
his conscience the idea of a burden, and of being heavily laden. <span
id="fr_152"></span>[153](#fn_152.md)

<span id="iii.iii.vi-p33"></span>[Gal.
6.6](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#006.md)<span
id="iii.iii.vi-p33.1"></span>. “But let him that is taught in the word
communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things.”

<span id="iii.iii.vi-p34"></span>Here he proceeds to discourse
concerning Teachers, to the effect that they ought to be tended with
great assiduity by their disciples. Now what is the reason that Christ
so commanded? For this law, “that they which preach the Gospel should
live of the Gospel,” ([1 Cor. ix.
14](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#014.md)<span
id="iii.iii.vi-p34.1"></span>.) is laid down in the New Testament; and
likewise in the Old, ([Num. 31:47](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#047.md),
[Num. 35:1](../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#001.md)<span
id="iii.iii.vi-p34.2"></span>.) many revenues accrued to the Levites
from the people; what is the reason, I say, that He so ordained? Was it
not for the sake of laying a foundation beforehand of lowliness and
love? For inasmuch as the dignity of a teacher oftentimes elates him who
possesses it, He, in order to repress his spirit, hath imposed on him
the necessity of requiring aid at the hands of his disciples. And to
these in turn he hath given <span id="fr_153"></span>[154](#fn_153.md)
means of cultivating kindly feelings, by training them, through the
kindness required of them to their Teacher, in gentleness towards others
also. By this means no slight affection is generated on both sides. Were
not the cause of this what I have stated it to be, why should He, who
fed the dull-minded Jews with manna, have reduced the Apostles to the
necessity of asking for aid? Is it not manifest He aimed at the great
benefits of humility and love, and that those who were under teaching
might not be ashamed of Teachers who were in appearance despicable? To
ask for aid bears the semblance of disgrace, but it ceased to be so,
when their Teachers with all boldness urged their claim, so that their
disciples derived from hence no small benefit, taught hereby to despise
all appearances. Wherefore he says, “But <span
id="fr_154"></span>[155](#fn_154.md) let him that is taught in the word
communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things,” that is, let him
show to him all generosity; this he implies by the words, “in all good
things.” Let the disciple, says he, keep nothing to himself, but have
every thing in common, for what he receives is better than what he
gives,—as much better as heavenly are better than earthly things. This
he expresses in another place, “If we sowed unto you spiritual things,
is it a great matter if we shall reap your carnal things?” ([1 Cor. ix.
11](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#011.md)<span
id="iii.iii.vi-p36.3"></span>.) Wherefore he gives the procedure the
name of a “communication,” showing that an interchange takes place.
Hereby too love is greatly fostered and confirmed. If the teacher asks
merely for competency, he does not by receiving it derogate from his own
dignity. For this is praiseworthy, so assidu<span id="page_45">p.
45</span> <span id="iii.iii.vi-Page_45"></span>ously to apply to the
Word, as to require the aid of others, and to be in manifold poverty,
and to be regardless of all the means of subsistence. But if he exceed
the due measure, he injures his dignity, not by mere receiving, but by
receiving too much. Then, lest the vice of the Teacher should render the
disciple more remiss in this matter, and he should frequently pass him
by, though poor, on account of his conduct, he proceeds to say,

<span id="iii.iii.vi-p37"></span>[Gal.
6.9](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#009.md)<span
id="iii.iii.vi-p37.1"></span>. “And let us not be weary in well
doing.” <span id="fr_155"></span>[156](#fn_155.md)

<span id="iii.iii.vi-p39"></span>And here he points out the difference
between ambition of this kind, and in temporal affairs, by saying, “Be
not deceived <span id="fr_156"></span>[157](#fn_156.md) ; God is not
mocked; for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap. For he
that soweth unto his own flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but
he that soweth unto the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap eternal life.”
As in the case of seeds, one who sows pulse cannot reap corn, for what
is sown and what is reaped must both be of one kind, so is it in
actions, he that plants in the flesh, wantonness, drunkenness, or
inordinate desire, shall reap the fruits of these things. And what are
these fruits? Punishment, retribution, shame, derision, destruction. For
of sumptuous tables and viands the end is no other than destruction; for
they both perish themselves, and destroy the body too. But the fruit of
the Spirit is of a nature not similar but contrary in all respects to
these. For consider; hast thou sown alms-giving? the treasures of heaven
and eternal glory await thee: hast thou sown temperance? honor and
reward, and the applause of Angels, and a crown from the Judge await
thee.

<span id="iii.iii.vi-p41"></span>[Gal.
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#009.md),
[10](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#010.md)<span
id="iii.iii.vi-p41.1"></span>. “And let us not be weary in well-doing;
for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not. So then as we have
opportunity, let us work that which is good toward all men, especially
toward them that are of the household of faith.”

<span id="iii.iii.vi-p42"></span>Lest any one should suppose that their
Teachers were to be cared for and supported, but that others might be
neglected, he makes his discourse general, and opens the door of this
charitable zeal to all; nay, he carries it to such a height, as to
command us to show mercy both to Jews and Greeks, in the proper
gradation indeed, but still to show mercy. And what is this gradation?
it consists in bestowing greater care upon the faithful. His endeavor
here is the same as in his other Epistles; he discourses not merely of
showing mercy, but of doing it with zeal and perseverance, for the
expressions of “sowing” and of “not fainting” imply this. Then, having
exacted a great work, he places its reward close at hand, and makes
mention of a new and wondrous harvest. Among husbandmen, not only the
sower but also the reaper endures much labor, having to struggle with
drought and dust and grievous toil, but in this case none of these
exist, as he shows by the words, “for in due season we shall reap, if we
faint not.” By this means he stimulates and draws them on; and he also
urges and presses them forward by another motive, saying, “As we have
therefore opportunity, let us do good.” As it is not always in our power
to sow, so neither is it to show mercy; for when we have been carried
hence, though we may desire it a thousand times, we shall be able to
effect nothing more. To this argument of ours the Ten Virgins ([Mat.
xxv. 1](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#001.md)<span
id="iii.iii.vi-p42.1"></span>. ff.) bear witness, who although they
wished it a thousand times, yet were shut out from the bridegroom,
because they brought with them no bountiful charity. And so does the
rich man who neglected Lazarus ([Luke xvi.
19](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#019.md)<span
id="iii.iii.vi-p42.2"></span>.) for he, being destitute of this succor,
although he wept and made many entreaties, won no compassion from the
Patriarch, or any one else, but continued destitute of all forgiveness,
and tormented with perpetual fire. Therefore he says, “as we have
opportunity, let us work that which is good toward all men,” hereby
especially also setting them free from the narrow-mindedness of the
Jews. For the whole of their benevolence was confined to their own race,
but the rule of life which Grace gives invites both land and sea to the
board of charity, only it shows a greater care for its own household.

<span id="iii.iii.vi-p43"></span>[Gal.
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#011.md),
[12](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#012.md)<span
id="iii.iii.vi-p43.1"></span>. “See with how large letters I have
written unto you with mine own hand. As many as desire to make a fair
show in the flesh, they compel you to be circumcised.”

<span id="iii.iii.vi-p44"></span>Observe what grief possesses his
blessed soul. As those who are oppressed with some sorrow, who have lost
one of their own kindred, and suffered an unexpected calamity, rest
neither by night nor day, because their grief besieges their soul, so
the blessed Paul, after a short moral discourse, returns again to that
former subject which chiefly disturbed his mind, saying as follows: “see
with how large letters I have written unto you with mine own hand.” By
this he signifies that he had written the whole letter <span
id="fr_157"></span>[158](#fn_157.md) <span id="page_46">p. 46</span> <span
id="iii.iii.vi-Page_46"></span>himself, which was a proof of great
sincerity. In his other Epistles he himself only dictated, another
wrote, as is plain from the Epistle to the Romans, for at its close it
is said, “I Tertius, who write the Epistle, salute you;” ([Rom. xvi.
22](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#022.md)<span
id="iii.iii.vi-p45.4"></span>.) but in this instance he wrote the whole
himself. And this he did by necessity, not from affection merely, but in
order to remove an injurious suspicion. Being charged with acts wherein
he had no part, and being reported to preach Circumcision yet to pretend
to preach it not, he was compelled to write the Epistle with his own
hand, thus laying up beforehand a written testimony. By the expression
“what sized,” he appears to me to signify, not the magnitude, but, the
misshapen appearance <span id="fr_158"></span>[159](#fn_158.md) of the
letters, as if he had said, “Although not well skilled in writing, I
have been compelled to write with my own hand to stop the mouth of these
traducers.”

<span id="iii.iii.vi-p47"></span>[Gal.
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#012.md),
[13](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#013.md)<span
id="iii.iii.vi-p47.1"></span>. “As many as desire to make a fair show in
the flesh, they compel you to be circumcised; only that they may not be
persecuted for the cross of Christ. For not even they who receive
circumcision do themselves keep the Law; but they desire to have you
circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.”

<span id="iii.iii.vi-p48"></span>Here he shows that they suffered this,
not willingly but of necessity, and affords them an opportunity of
retreat, almost speaking in their defence, and exhorting them to abandon
their teachers with all speed. What is the meaning of “to make a fair
show in the flesh?” it means, to be esteemed by men. As they were
reviled by the Jews for deserting the customs of their fathers, they
desire, says he, to injure you, that they may not have this charged
against them, but vindicate themselves by means of your flesh. <span
id="fr_159"></span>[160](#fn_159.md) His object here is to show that they
did not so act from respect to God; it is as if he said, This procedure
is not founded in piety, all this is done through human ambition; in
order that the unbelievers may be gratified by the mutilation of the
faithful, they choose to offend God that they may please men; for this
is the meaning of, “to make a fair show in the flesh.” Then, as a proof
that for another reason too they are unpardonable, he again convinces
them that, not only in order to please others, but for their own vain
glory, <span id="fr_160"></span>[161](#fn_160.md) they had enjoined this.
Wherefore he adds, “that they may glory in your flesh,” as if they had
disciples, and were teachers. And what is the proof of this? “For not
even they themselves,” he says, “keep the Law;” even if they did keep
it, they would incur grave censure, but now their very purpose is
corrupt.

<span id="iii.iii.vi-p51"></span>[Gal.
6.14](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#014.md)<span
id="iii.iii.vi-p51.1"></span>. “But far be it from me to glory, save in
the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.”

<span id="iii.iii.vi-p52"></span>Truly this symbol is thought
despicable; but it is so in the world’s reckoning, and among men; in
Heaven and among the faithful it is the highest glory. Poverty too is
despicable, but it is our boast; and to be cheaply thought of by the
public is a matter of laughter to them, but we are elated by it. So too
is the Cross our boast. He does not say, “I boast not,” nor, “I will not
boast,” but, “Far be it from me that I should,” as if he abominated it
as absurd, and invoked the aid of God in order to his success therein.
And what is the boast of the Cross? That Christ for my sake took on Him
the form of a slave, and bore His sufferings for me the slave, the
enemy, the unfeeling one; yea He so loved me as to give Himself up to a
curse for me. What can be comparable to this! If servants who only
receive praise from their masters, to whom they are akin by nature, are
elated thereby, how must we not boast when the Master who is very God is
not ashamed of the Cross which was endured for us. Let us then not be
ashamed of His unspeakable tenderness; He was not ashamed of being
crucified for thy sake, and wilt thou be ashamed to confess His infinite
solicitude? It is as if a prisoner who had not been ashamed of his King,
should, after that King had come to the prison and himself loosed the
chains, become ashamed of him on that account. Yet this would be the
height of madness, for this very fact would be an especial ground for
boasting.

<span id="iii.iii.vi-p53"></span>[Gal.
6.14](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#014.md)<span
id="iii.iii.vi-p53.1"></span>. “Through which the world hath been
crucified unto me, and I unto the world.” <span
id="fr_161"></span>[162](#fn_161.md)

<span id="iii.iii.vi-p55"></span>What he here calls the world is not the
heaven nor the earth, but the affairs of life, the praise of men,
retinues, glory, wealth, and all such things as have a show of splendor.
To me these things are dead. Such an one it behooves a Christian to be,
and always to use this language. Nor was he content with the former
putting to death, but added another, saying, “and I unto the world,”
thus implying a double putting to death, and saying, They are dead to
me, and I to them, neither can they captivate and overcome me, for they
are dead once for all, <span id="page_47">p. 47</span> <span
id="iii.iii.vi-Page_47"></span>nor can I desire them, for I too am dead
to them. Nothing can be more blessed than this putting to death, for it
is the foundation of the blessed life.

<span id="iii.iii.vi-p56"></span>[Gal.
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#015.md),
[16](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#016.md)<span
id="iii.iii.vi-p56.1"></span>. “For neither is circumcision any thing,
nor uncircumcision, but a new creature. And as many as shall walk by
this rule, peace be upon them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.”

<span id="iii.iii.vi-p57"></span>Observe the power of the Cross, to what
a pitch it hath raised him! not only hath it put to death for him all
mundane affairs, but hath set him far above the Old Dispensation. What
can be comparable to this power? for the Cross hath persuaded him, who
was willing to be slain and to slay others for the sake of circumcision,
to leave it on a level with uncircumcision, and to seek for things
strange and marvellous and above the heavens. This our rule of life he
calls “a new creature,” both on account of what is past, and of what is
to come; of what is past, because our soul, which had grown old with the
oldness of sin, hath been all at once renewed by baptism, as if it had
been created again. <span id="fr_162"></span>[163](#fn_162.md) Wherefore we
require a new and heavenly rule of life. And of things to come, because
both the heaven and the earth, and all the creation, shall with our
bodies be translated into incorruption. Tell me not then, he says, of
circumcision, which now availeth nothing; (for how shall it appear, when
all things have undergone such a change?) but seek the new things of
grace. For they who pursue these things shall enjoy peace and amity, and
may properly be called by the name of “Israel.” While they who hold
contrary sentiments, although they be descended from him (Israel) and
bear his appellation, have yet fallen away from all these things, both
the relationship and the name itself. But it is in their power to be
true Israelites, who keep this rule, who desist from the old ways, and
follow after grace.

<span id="iii.iii.vi-p59"></span>[Gal.
6.17](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#017.md)<span
id="iii.iii.vi-p59.1"></span>. “From henceforth let no man trouble me.”

<span id="iii.iii.vi-p60"></span>This he says not as though he were
wearied or overpowered; he who chose to do and suffer all for his
disciples’ sake; he who said, “Be instant in season, out of season;” ([2
Tim. iv. 2](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#002.md)<span
id="iii.iii.vi-p60.1"></span>.) he who said, “If peradventure God may
give them repentance unto the knowledge of the truth, and they may
recover themselves out of the snare of the devil;” ([2 Tim.
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#025.md),
[26](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#026.md)<span
id="iii.iii.vi-p60.2"></span>.) how shall he now become relaxed and fall
back? Wherefore does he say this? it is to gird up their slothful mind,
and to impress them with deeper fear, and to ratify the laws enacted by
himself, and to restrain their perpetual fluctuations. <span
id="fr_163"></span>[164](#fn_163.md)

<span id="iii.iii.vi-p62"></span>[Gal.
6.17](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#017.md)<span
id="iii.iii.vi-p62.1"></span>. “For I bear branded on my body the marks
of Jesus.”

<span id="iii.iii.vi-p63"></span>He says not, “I have,” but, “I bear,”
like a man priding himself on trophies and royal ensigns. Although on a
second thought it seems a disgrace, yet does this man vaunt of his
wounds, and like military standard-bearers, so does he exult in bearing
about these wounds. And why does he say this? “More clearly by those
wounds than by any argument, than by any language, do I vindicate
myself,” says he. For these wounds utter a voice louder than a trumpet
against my opponents, and against those who say that I play the
hypocrite in my teaching, and speak what may please men. For no one who
saw a soldier retiring from the battle bathed in blood and with a
thousand wounds, would dare to accuse him of cowardice and treachery,
seeing that he bears on his body the proofs of his valor, and so ought
ye, he says, to judge of me. And if any one desire to hear my defence,
and to learn my sentiments, let him consider my wounds, which afford a
stronger proof than these words and letters. At the outset of his
Epistle he evinced his sincerity by the suddenness of his conversion, at
its close he proves it by the perils which attended his conversion. That
it might not be objected that he had changed his course with upright
intentions, but that he had not continued in the same purpose, he
produces his trials, his dangers, his stripes as witnesses that he had
so continued.

<span id="iii.iii.vi-p64"></span>Then having clearly justified himself
in every particular, and proved that he had spoken nothing from anger or
malevolence, but had preserved his affection towards them unimpaired, he
again establishes this same point by concluding his discourse with a
prayer teeming with a thousand blessings, in these words;

<span id="iii.iii.vi-p65"></span>[Gal.
6.18](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#018.md)<span
id="iii.iii.vi-p65.1"></span>. “The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be
with your spirit, brethren. Amen.”

<span id="iii.iii.vi-p66"></span>By this last word he hath sealed all
that preceded it. He says not merely, “with you,” as elsewhere, but,
“with your spirit,” thus withdrawing them from carnal <span
id="fr_164"></span>[165](#fn_164.md) things, and displaying throughout the
beneficence of God, and reminding them of the grace which they enjoyed,
whereby he was able to recall them from all their judaizing errors. For
to have received the Spirit came not of the poverty of the Law, but of
the righteousness which is by Faith, and to <span id="page_48">p.

came not from Circumcision but from Grace. On this account he concluded
his exhortation with a prayer, reminding them of grace and the Spirit,
and at the same time addressing them as brethren, and supplicating God
that they might continue to enjoy these blessings, thus providing for
them a twofold security. For both prayer and teaching, tended to the
same thing and together became to them as a double wall. For teaching,
reminding them of what benefits they enjoyed, the rather kept them in
the doctrine of the Church; and prayer, invoking grace, and exhorting to
an enduring constancy, permitted not the Spirit to depart from them. And
He abiding in them, all the error of such doctrines as they held was
shaken off like dust. <span id="fr_165"></span>[166](#fn_165.md)

excuse and qualify, whereas <span class="Greek"><span

of Christ. But if ([Gal. 6.3](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#003.md)<span

one exalts himself above others, he is nothing worth and is a vain

id="iii.iii.vi-p31.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iii.vi-p32"></span> \[Ellicott says, “The qualitative and
humbling distinction of Chrysostom does not appear natural or probable,
nor does it refer to that which will take place in every man after the
examination (Meyer); but is apparently used ethically in reference to
what according to the nature of things must be the case.”—G.A.\]

<span id="fn_153"></span>[44:154](1130011.htm#fr_153.md) <span

id="iii.iii.vi-p35.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iii.vi-p36"></span> \[Different views are held as to the
connection of this with the preceding. Lightfoot says the connection is
this: “I spoke of bearing one another’s burdens. There is one special
application I would make of this rule; provide for the wants of your
teachers. <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.iii.vi-p36.1"></span>Δέ</span> arrests a former topic before it
passes out of sight.” (Compare [Gal.
4.20](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#020.md)<span
id="iii.iii.vi-p36.2"></span>.) But Ellicott takes a different view and
says: “The duty of sharing their temporal blessings with their teacher
is placed in contrast with the foregoing declaration of individual
responsibility in spiritual matter.” So also Meyer who, however, refers
it to moral good.—G.A.\]

<span id="fn_155"></span>[45:156](1130011.htm#fr_155.md) <span
id="iii.iii.vi-p37.2"></span>

<span id="iii.iii.vi-p38"></span> \[Dislocated by Chrysostom. This is a
part of [Gal. 6.9](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#009.md)<span
id="iii.iii.vi-p38.1"></span>, and is an encouragement not to become
weary in below sowing to the Spirit.— Meyer.—G.A.\]

<span id="fn_156"></span>[45:157](1130011.htm#fr_156.md) <span
id="iii.iii.vi-p39.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iii.vi-p40"></span> \[Meyer, understanding “all good
things” to mean every thing that is morally good, says, that this is a
warning to the readers, in respect to this necessary moral fellowship
not to allow themselves to be led astray (by the teachers of error or
otherwise). Lightfoot and Schaff refer this warning to the consequences
of failure to share their temporal blessings with their teachers.
Ellicott says, “[Gal. 6.7](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#007.md)<span
id="iii.iii.vi-p40.1"></span> is a continuation of the subject in a more
general and extended way but not without reference to the special
command which immediately precedes.”—G.A.\]

<span id="fn_157"></span>[45:158](1130011.htm#fr_157.md) <span
id="iii.iii.vi-p44.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iii.vi-p45"></span> \[Ellicott hesitatingly adopts this
view also. So Alford and Riddle (in Lange). But Meyer, Schaff, Schmoller
(in Lange) and Lightfoot say that <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.iii.vi-p45.1"></span>ἔ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.iii.vi-p45.2"></span>γραψα</span>([Philem.
19](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#019.md)<span
id="iii.iii.vi-p45.3"></span>.) is the epistolary aorist and marks the
point at which Paul takes the pen from the amanuensis; and that only
this concluding paragraph was written with his own hand. So the American
Committee also in the Rev. Ver.—G.A.\]

<span id="fn_158"></span>[46:159](1130011.htm#fr_158.md) <span
id="iii.iii.vi-p45.5"></span>

<span id="iii.iii.vi-p46"></span> \[“The word used, <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.iii.vi-p46.1"></span>πηλίκοις</span>,
denotes size not irregularity. Nor is it probable that Paul who was
educated at Jerusalem and Tarsus, the great centre of Jewish and Greek
learning, was ignorant and unskillful in writing Greek. The boldness of
the handwriting answers to the force of the Apostle’s
convictions.”—Lightfoot.—G.A.\]

<span id="fn_159"></span>[46:160](1130011.htm#fr_159.md) <span
id="iii.iii.vi-p48.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iii.vi-p49"></span> \[“Certain men have an ‘object’ in
displaying their zeal for carnal ordinances. They hope thereby to save
themselves from persecution for professing the cross of
Christ.”—Lightfoot.—G.A.\]

<span id="fn_160"></span>[46:161](1130011.htm#fr_160.md) <span
id="iii.iii.vi-p49.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iii.vi-p50"></span> \[“They advocate circumcision and yet
they themselves neglect the ordinances of the Law. They could not face
the obloquy to which their abandonment of the Mosaic Law would expose
them. So they tried to keep on good terms with their unconverted
fellow-Jews by imposing circumcision on the Gentile converts also thus
getting the credit of zeal for the law.”—Lightfoot.—G.A.\]

<span id="fn_161"></span>[46:162](1130011.htm#fr_161.md) <span
id="iii.iii.vi-p53.2"></span>

<span id="iii.iii.vi-p54"></span> \[“For myself, on the other hand, far
be it from me, etc.: By way of contrast to the boasting of the
pseudo-apostles, Paul now presents his own ground of boasting, namely,
the crucifixion of Christ, by whose crucifixion is produced the result
that no fellowship of life longer exists between him and the world: it
is dead for him and he is dead for it.”—Meyer.—*Alter pro mortuo habet
alterum*. (Schott.)—G.A.\]

<span id="fn_162"></span>[47:163](1130011.htm#fr_162.md) <span
id="iii.iii.vi-p57.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iii.vi-p58"></span> \[“It is a matter of indifference
whether one is circumcised or uncircumcised; and the only matter of
importance is that one should be created anew, transferred into a new
spiritual condition of life.”—Meyer.—G.A.\]

<span id="fn_163"></span>[47:164](1130011.htm#fr_163.md) <span
id="iii.iii.vi-p60.3"></span>

<span id="iii.iii.vi-p61"></span> \[Lightfoot similarly, but more
clearly; “Paul closes the epistle as he began it, with an uncompromising
assertion of his authority: Henceforth let no man question my authority;
let no man thwart or annoy me. Jesus is my Master and his brand is
stamped on my body. I bear this badge of an honorable servitude.”—G.A.\]

<span id="fn_164"></span>[47:165](1130011.htm#fr_164.md) <span
id="iii.iii.vi-p66.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iii.vi-p67"></span> \[So also Lightfoot, who says, “with
your spirit” is probably in reference to the carnal religion of the
Galatians, but this cannot be pressed because the same form of
benediction occurs in [Phlm. 1:25](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#025.md), [2
Tim. 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#022.md)<span
id="iii.iii.vi-p67.1"></span>. Meyer denies there is any such allusion
at all. G.A.\]

<span id="fn_165"></span>[48:166](1130011.htm#fr_165.md) <span
id="iii.iii.vi-p67.2"></span>

<span id="iii.iii.vi-p68"></span> \[Dr. Schaff strikingly says: “The
last sentence of this polemic Epistle is a benediction and the last word
is a word of affection, ‘brethren.’ (The word <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.iii.vi-p68.1"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.iii.vi-p68.2"></span>δελφοί</span> stands last in the true text,
as the Rev. Version has it.) It takes the sting out of the severity.
Thus concludes this Epistle so full of polemic fire and zeal, yet more
full of grace—free sovereign grace, justifying sanctifying grace, and
full of forgiving love even to ungrateful pupils; an Epistle for the
time and an Epistle for all times.”—*Popular Commentary*, *in
loco*.—G.A.\]
