class="c1"><span id="iv.iv.i-p9.2"></span>[Col.

id="iv.iv.i-p9.3"></span></span>

<span id="iv.iv.i-p10"></span>“Paul, an Apostle of Christ Jesus through
the will of God, and Timothy our brother, to the saints and faithful
brethren in Christ which are at Colossæ: Grace to you, and peace, from
God our Father.”

<span id="iv.iv.i-p11"></span><span class="c13"><span
id="iv.iv.i-p11.1"></span>Holy</span> indeed are all the Epistles of
Paul: but some advantage have those which he sent after he was in bonds:
those, for instance, to the Ephesians and Philemon: that to Timothy,
that to the Philippians, and the one before us: for this also was sent
when he was a prisoner, since he writes in it thus: “for which I am also
in bonds: that I may make it manifest as I ought to speak.” ([Col.
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#003.md),
[4](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#004)<span id="iv.iv.i-p11.2"></span>..md)
But this Epistle appears to have been written after that to the Romans.
For the one to the Romans he wrote before he had seen them, but this
Epistle, after; and near upon the close of his preaching. <span
id="fr_689"></span>[690](#fn_689.md) And it is evident from hence; that in
the Epistle to Philemon he says, “Being such an one as Paul the aged”
([Philem. 9](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#009.md)<span
id="iv.iv.i-p12.1"></span>.), and makes request for Onesimus; but in
this he sends Onesimus himself, as he says, “With Onesimus the faithful
and beloved brother” ([Col. iv. 9](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#009.md)<span
id="iv.iv.i-p12.2"></span>.): calling him faithful, and beloved, and
brother. Wherefore also he boldly says in this Epistle, “from the hope
of the Gospel which ye heard, which was preached in all creation under
heaven.” ([Col. i. 23](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#023.md)<span
id="iv.iv.i-p12.3"></span>.) For it had now been preached for a long
time. I think then that the Epistle to Timothy was written after this;
and when he was now come to the very end of his life, for there he says,
“for I am already being offered” ([2 Tim. iv.
6](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#006)<span id="iv.iv.i-p12.4"></span>..md);
this is later <span id="fr_690"></span>[691](#fn_690.md) however than that
to the Philippians, for in that Epistle he was just entering upon his
imprisonment at Rome.

<span id="iv.iv.i-p14"></span>But why do I say that these Epistles have
some advantage over the rest in this respect, because he writes while in
bonds? As if a champion were to write in the midst of carnage and
victory; <span id="fr_691"></span>[692](#fn_691.md) so also in truth did
he. For himself too was aware that this was a great thing, for writing
to Philemon he saith, “Whom I have begotten in my bonds.” ([Philem.
10](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#010)<span id="iv.iv.i-p15.1"></span>..md)
And this he said, that we should not be dispirited when in adversity,
but even rejoice. At this place was Philemon with these (Colossians).
For in the Epistle to him he saith, “And to Archippus our
fellow-soldier” ([Philem. 2](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#002.md)<span
id="iv.iv.i-p15.2"></span>.); and in this, “Say to Archippus.” ([Col.
iv. 17](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#017.md)<span
id="iv.iv.i-p15.3"></span>.) This man seems to me to have been charged
with some office in the Church.

<span id="iv.iv.i-p16"></span>But he had not seen either these people,
or the Romans, or the Hebrews, when he wrote to them. That this is true
of the others, he shows in many places; with regard to the Colossians,
hear him saying, “And as many as have <span id="page_258">p. 258</span>
<span id="iv.iv.i-Page_258"></span>not seen my face in the flesh” ([Col.
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#001.md),
[5](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#005)<span id="iv.iv.i-p16.1"></span>..md):
and again, “Though I am absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the
spirit.” So great a thing did he know his presence everywhere to be. And
always, even though he be absent, he makes himself present. So, when he
punishes the fornicator, look how he places himself on the tribunal;
“for,” he saith, “I verily being absent in body, but present in spirit,
have judged already as though I were present” ([1 Cor. v.
3](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#003)<span id="iv.iv.i-p16.2"></span>..md):
and again, “I will come to you, and will know not the word of them which
are puffed up, but the power” ([1 Cor. iv.
19](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#019)<span id="iv.iv.i-p16.3"></span>..md):
and again, “Not only when I am present with you, but much more when I am
absent.” ([Phil. 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#012.md), [Gal.
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#018)<span id="iv.iv.i-p16.4"></span>..md)

<span id="iv.iv.i-p17"></span>“Paul an Apostle of Jesus Christ through
the will of God.”

<span id="iv.iv.i-p18"></span>It were well also to say, what from
considering this Epistle we have found to be its occasion and subject.
What then is it? They used to approach <span
id="fr_692"></span>[693](#fn_692.md) God through angels; they held many
Jewish and Grecian observances. These things then he is correcting.
Wherefore in the very outset he says, “Through the will of God.” So here
again he hath used the expression “through.” <span
id="fr_693"></span>[694](#fn_693.md) “And Timothy the brother,” he saith;
of course then he too was an Apostle, <span
id="fr_694"></span>[695](#fn_694.md) and probably also known to them. “To
the saints which are at Colossæ.” This was a city of Phrygia, as is
plain from Laodicea’s being near to it. “And faithful brethren in
Christ.” ([Col. iv. 16](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#016.md)<span
id="iv.iv.i-p21.3"></span>.) Whence, saith he, art thou made a saint?
Tell me. Whence art thou called faithful? Is it not because thou wert
sanctified through death? Is it not because thou hast faith in Christ?
Whence art thou made a brother? for neither in deed, nor in word, nor in
achievement didst thou show thyself faithful. Tell me, whence is it that
thou hast been entrusted with so great mysteries? Is it not because of
Christ?

<span id="iv.iv.i-p22"></span>“Grace to you and peace from God our
Father.” Whence cometh grace to you? Whence peace? “From God,” saith he,
“our Father.” Although he useth not in this place the name of Christ.

<span id="iv.iv.i-p23"></span>I will ask those who speak disparagingly
of the Spirit, Whence is God the Father of servants? Who wrought these
mighty achievements? Who made thee a saint? Who faithful? Who a son of
God? He who made thee worthy to be trusted, the same is also the cause
of thy being entrusted with all.

<span id="iv.iv.i-p24"></span>For we are called faithful, not only
because we have faith, but also because we are entrusted of God with
mysteries which not even angels knew before us. However, to Paul it was
indifferent whether or not to put it thus.

<span id="iv.iv.i-p25"></span>[Col.
1.3](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#003.md)<span id="iv.iv.i-p25.1"></span>.
“We give thanks to God, <span id="fr_695"></span>[696](#fn_695.md) the
Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.”

<span id="iv.iv.i-p27"></span>He seems to me to refer everything to the
Father, that what he has to say may not at once offend them. <span
id="fr_696"></span>[697](#fn_696.md)

<span id="iv.iv.i-p29"></span>“Praying always for you.”

<span id="iv.iv.i-p30"></span>He shows his love, not by giving thanks
only, but also by continual prayer, in that those whom he did not see,
he had continually within himself.

<span id="iv.iv.i-p31"></span>[Col.
1.4](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#004.md)<span id="iv.iv.i-p31.1"></span>.
\[“Having heard of your faith in Christ Jesus.”

<span id="iv.iv.i-p32"></span>A little above he said, “our Lord.” “He,”
saith he, “is Lord, not the servants.” “Of Jesus Christ.” These names
also are symbols of His benefit to us, for “He,” it means, “shall save
His people from their sins.” <span id="fr_697"></span>[698](#fn_697.md)
([Matt. i. 21](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#021.md)<span
id="iv.iv.i-p33.2"></span>.)\]

<span id="iv.iv.i-p34"></span>[Col.
1.4](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#004.md)<span id="iv.iv.i-p34.1"></span>.
“Having heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which ye
have toward all the saints.”

<span id="iv.iv.i-p35"></span>Already he conciliates them. It was
Epaphroditus <span id="fr_698"></span>[699](#fn_698.md) who brought him
this account. But he sends the Epistle by Tychicus, retaining
Epaphroditus with himself. “And of the love,” he saith, “which ye have
toward all the saints,” not toward this one and that: of course then
toward us also.

<span id="iv.iv.i-p37"></span>[Col.
1.5](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#005.md)<span id="iv.iv.i-p37.1"></span>.
“Because of the hope which is laid up for you in the heavens.”

<span id="iv.iv.i-p38"></span>He speaks of the good things to come. This
is with a view to their temptations, that they should not seek their
rest here. For lest any should say, “And where is the good of their love
toward the saints, if they themselves are in affliction?” he says, “We
rejoice that ye are securing for yourselves a noble reception in
heaven.” “Because of the hope,” he saith, “which is laid up.” He shows
its secureness. “Whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth.” Here
the expression is as if he would chide them, as having changed from it
when they had long held it.

<span id="iv.iv.i-p39"></span>“Whereof,” saith he, “ye heard before in
the word of the truth of the Gospel.” And he bears witness to its truth.
With good reason, for in it there is nothing false.

<span id="iv.iv.i-p40"></span>“Of the Gospel.” He doth not say, “of the
preaching,” but he calleth it the “Gospel,” con<span id="page_259">p.
259</span> <span id="iv.iv.i-Page_259"></span>tinually reminding them of
God’s benefits. <span id="fr_699"></span>[700](#fn_699.md) And having first
praised them, he next reminds them of these.

<span id="iv.iv.i-p42"></span>[Col.
1.6](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#006.md)<span id="iv.iv.i-p42.1"></span>.
“Which is come unto you, even as it is also in all the world.”

<span id="iv.iv.i-p43"></span>He now gives them credit. “Is come,” he
said metaphorically. He means, it did not come and go away, but that it
remained, and was there. Then because to the many the strongest
confirmation of doctrines is that they hold them in common with many, he
therefore added, “As also it is in all the world.”

<span id="iv.iv.i-p44"></span>It is present everywhere, everywhere
victorious, everywhere established.

<span id="iv.iv.i-p45"></span>“And is bearing fruit, and
increasing, <span id="fr_700"></span>[701](#fn_700.md) as it doth in you
also.”

<span id="iv.iv.i-p47"></span>“Bearing fruit.” In works. “Increasing.”
By the accession of many, by becoming firmer; for plants then begin to
thicken when they have become firm.

<span id="iv.iv.i-p48"></span>“As also among you,” says he.

<span id="iv.iv.i-p49"></span>He first gains the hearer by his praises,
so that even though disinclined, he may not refuse to hear him.

<span id="iv.iv.i-p50"></span>“Since the day ye heard it.”

<span id="iv.iv.i-p51"></span>Marvelous! that ye quickly came unto it
and believed; and straightway, from the very first, showed forth its
fruits.

<span id="iv.iv.i-p52"></span>“Since the day ye heard, and knew the
grace of God in truth.”

<span id="iv.iv.i-p53"></span>Not in word, saith he, nor in deceit, but
in very deeds. Either then this is what he means by “bearing fruit,” or
else, the signs and wonders. Because as soon as ye received it, so soon
ye knew the grace of God. What then forthwith gave proofs of its
inherent virtue, is it not a hard thing that that should now be
disbelieved?

<span id="iv.iv.i-p54"></span>[Col.
1.7](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#007.md)<span id="iv.iv.i-p54.1"></span>.
“Even as ye learned of Epaphras our beloved fellow-servant.”

<span id="iv.iv.i-p55"></span>He, it is probable, had preached there.
“Ye learned” the Gospel. Then to show the trustworthiness of the man, he
says, “our fellow servant.”

<span id="iv.iv.i-p56"></span>“Who is a faithful minister of Christ on
your <span id="fr_701"></span>[702](#fn_701.md) behalf; who also declared
unto us your love in the Spirit.”

<span id="iv.iv.i-p58"></span>Doubt not, he saith, of the hope which is
to come: ye see that the world is being converted. And what need to
allege the cases of others? what happened in your own is even
independently a sufficient ground for belief, for, “ye knew the grace of
God in truth:” that is, in works. So that these two things, viz. the
belief of all, and your own too, confirm the things that are to come.
Nor was the fact one thing, and what Epaphras said, another. “Who is,”
saith he, “faithful,” that is, true. How, “a minister on your behalf”?
In that he had gone to him. “Who also declared to us,” saith he, “your
love in the Spirit,” that is, the spiritual love ye bear us. If this man
be the minister of Christ; how say ye, that you approach God by angels?
“Who also declared unto us,” saith he, “your love in the Spirit.” For
this love is wonderful and steadfast; all other has but the name. And
there are some persons who are not of this kind, but such is not
friendship, wherefore also it is easily dissolved.

<span id="iv.iv.i-p59"></span>There are many causes which produce
friendship; and we will pass over those which are infamous, (for none
will take an objection against us in their favor, seeing they are evil.)
But let us, if you will, review those which are natural, and those which
arise out of the relations of life. Now of the social sort are these,
for instance; one receives a kindness, or inherits a friend from
forefathers, or has been a companion at table or in travel: or is
neighbor to another (and these are virtuous); or is of the same trade,
which last however is not sincere; for it is attended by a certain
emulation and envy. But the natural are such as that of father to son,
son to father, brother to brother, grandfather to descendant, mother to
children, and if you like let us add also that of wife to husband; for
all matrimonial attachments are also of this life, and earthly. Now
these latter appear stronger than the former: appear, I said, because
often they are surpassed by them. For friends have at times shown a more
genuinely kind disposition than brothers, or than sons toward fathers;
and when he whom a man hath begotten would not succor him, one who knew
him not has stood by him, and succored him. But the spiritual love is
higher than all, as it were some queen ruling her subjects; and in her
form is bright: for not as the other, hath she aught of earth for her
parent; neither habitual intercourse, nor benefits, nor nature, nor
time; but she descendeth from above, out of heaven. And why wonderest
thou that she needeth no benefits in order that she should subsist,
seeing that neither by injuries is she overthrown?

<span id="iv.iv.i-p60"></span>Now that this love is greater than the
other, hear Paul saying; “For I could wish that I myself were anathema
from Christ for my brethren.” ([Rom. ix.
3](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#003)<span id="iv.iv.i-p60.1"></span>..md)
What father would have thus wished himself in misery? And again, “To
depart, and to be with Christ” is “very far better; yet to abide in the
flesh” is “more needful for your sake.” ([Phil.
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#023.md),
[24](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#024)<span id="iv.iv.i-p60.2"></span>..md)
What mother would have chosen so to speak, regardless of herself? And
again hear him saying, “For being bereaved of you for a short season, in
pres<span id="page_260">p. 260</span> <span
id="iv.iv.i-Page_260"></span>ence, not in heart.” ([1 Thess. ii.
17](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#017)<span id="iv.iv.i-p60.3"></span>..md)
And here indeed \[in the world\], when a father hath been insulted, he
withdraws his love; not so however there, but he went to those who
stoned him, seeking to do them good. For nothing, nothing is so strong
as the bond of the Spirit. For he who became a friend from receiving
benefits, will, should these be discontinued, become an enemy; he whom
habitual intercourse made inseparable, will, when the habit is broken
through, let his friendship become extinct. A wife again, should a broil
have taken place, will leave her husband, and withdraw affection; the
son, when he sees his father living to a great age, is dissatisfied. But
in case of spiritual love there is nothing of this. For by none of these
things can it be dissolved; seeing it is not composed out of them.
Neither time, nor length of journey, nor ill usage, nor being evil
spoken of, nor anger, nor insult, nor any other thing, make inroads upon
it, nor have the power of dissolving it. And that thou mayest know this
Moses was stoned, and yet he made entreaty for them. ([Ex. xvii.
4](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#004)<span id="iv.iv.i-p60.4"></span>..md)
What father would have done this for one that stoned him, and would not
rather have stoned him too to death?

<span id="iv.iv.i-p61"></span>Let us then follow after these friendships
which are of the Spirit, for they are strong, and hard to be dissolved,
and not those which arise from the table, for these we are forbidden to
carry in Thither. For hear Christ saying in the Gospel, Call not thy
friends nor thy neighbors, if thou makest a feast, but the lame, the
maimed. ([Luke xiv. 12](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#012.md)<span
id="iv.iv.i-p61.1"></span>.) With reason: for great is the recompense
for these. But thou canst not, nor endurest to feast with lame and
blind, but thinkest it grievous and offensive, and refusest. Now it were
indeed best that thou shouldest not refuse, however it is not necessary
to do it. If thou seatest them not with thee, send to them of the dishes
on thy own table. And he that inviteth his friends, hath done no great
thing: for he hath received his recompense here. But he that called the
maimed, and poor, hath God for his Debtor. Let us then not repine when
we receive not a reward here, but when we do receive; for we shall have
nothing more to receive There. In like manner, if man recompense, God
recompenseth not; if man recompense not, then God will recompense. Let
us then not seek those out for our benefits, who have it in their power
to requite us again, nor bestow our favors on them with such an
expectation: this were a cold thought. If thou invite a friend, the
gratitude lasts till evening; and therefore the friendship for the nonce
is spent more quickly than the expenses are paid. But if thou call the
poor and the maimed, never shall the gratitude perish, for God, who
remembereth ever, and never forgetteth, thou hast even Him for thy
Debtor. What squeamishness is this, pray, that thou canst not sit down
in company with the poor? What sayest thou? He is unclean and filthy?
Then wash him, and lead him up to thy table. But he hath filthy
garments? Then change them, and give him clean apparel. Seest thou not
how great the gain is? Christ cometh unto thee through him, and dost
thou make petty calculations of such things? When thou art inviting the
King to thy table, dost thou fear because of such things as these?

<span id="iv.iv.i-p62"></span>Let us suppose two tables, and let one be
filled with those, and have the blind, the halt, the maimed in hand or
leg, the barefoot, those clad with but one scanty garment, and that worn
out: but let the other have grandees, generals, governors, great
officers, arrayed in costly robes, and fine lawn, belted with golden
girdles. Again, here at the table of the poor let there be neither
silver, nor store of wine, but just enough to refresh and gladden, and
let the drinking cups and the rest of the vessels be made from glass
only; but there, at the table of the rich, let all the vessels be of
silver and gold, and the semicircular table, <span
id="fr_702"></span>[703](#fn_702.md) not such as one person can lift, but
as two young men can with difficulty move, and the wine-jars lie in
order, glittering far beyond the silver with gold, and let the
semicircle <span id="fr_703"></span>[704](#fn_703.md) be smoothly laid all
over with soft drapery. Here, again, let there be many servants, in
garments not less ornamented than those of the guests, and bravely
appareled, and wearing loose trowsers, men beauteous to look upon, in
the very flower of life, plump, and well conditioned; but there let
there be only two servants disdaining all that proud vanity. And let
those have costly meats, but these only enough to appease hunger and
inspire cheerfulness. Have I said enough? and are both tables laid out
with sufficient minuteness? Is anything wanting? I think not. For I have
gone over the guests, and the costliness both of the vessels, and of the
linen, <span id="fr_704"></span>[705](#fn_704.md) and the meats. <span
id="fr_705"></span>[706](#fn_705.md) However, if we should have omitted
aught, we shall discover it as we proceed with the discourse.

<span id="iv.iv.i-p67"></span><span id="page_261">p. 261</span> <span
id="iv.iv.i-Page_261"></span>Come then, now that we have correctly drawn
each table in its proper outline, let us see at which ye will seat
yourselves. For I for my part am going to that of the blind, and the
lame, but probably the more part of you will choose the other, that of
the generals, that is so gay and splendid. Let us then see which of them
doth more abound in pleasure; for as yet let us not examine into the
things of hereafter, seeing that in those at least this of mine hath the
superiority. Wherefore? Because this one hath Christ sitting down at it,
the other men, this hath the Master, that the servants. But say we
nothing of these things as yet; but let us see which hath the more of
present pleasure. And even in this respect, then, this pleasure is
greater, for it is more pleasure to sit down with a King than with his
servants. But let us withdraw this consideration also; let us examine
the matter simply by itself. I, then, and those who choose the table I
do, shall with much freedom and ease of mind both say and hear
everything: but you trembling and fearing, and ashamed before those you
sit down with, will not even have the heart to reach out your hands,
just as though you had got to a school, and not a dinner, just as though
you were trembling before dreadful masters. But not so they. But, saith
one, the honor is great. Nay, I further am in more honor; for your mean
estate appears grander, when even whilst sharing the same table, the
words ye utter are those of slaves.

<span id="iv.iv.i-p68"></span>For the servant then most of all shows as
such, when he sits down with his master; for he is in a place where he
ought not to be; nor hath he from such familiarity so much dignity as he
hath abasement, for he is then abased exceedingly. And one may see a
servant by himself make a brave appearance, and the poor man seem
splendid by himself, rather than when he is walking with a rich one; for
the low when near the lofty, then appears low, and the juxtaposition
makes the low seem lower, not loftier. So too your sitting down with
them makes you seem as of yet meaner condition. But not so, us. In these
two things, then, we have the advantage, in freedom, and in honor; which
have nothing equal to them in regard of pleasure. For I at least would
prefer a crust with freedom, to thousands of dainties with slavery. For,
saith one, “Better is an entertainment of herbs with love and kindness,
than an ox from the stall with hatred.” ([Prov. xv.
17](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#017)<span id="iv.iv.i-p68.1"></span>..md)
For whatsoever those may say, they who are present must needs praise it,
or give offense; assuming thus the rank of parasites, or rather, being
worse than they. For parasites indeed, even though it be with shame and
insult, have yet liberty of speech: but ye have not even this. But your
meanness is indeed as great, (for ye fear and crouch,) but not so your
honor. Surely then that table is deprived of every pleasure, but this is
replete with all delight of soul.

<span id="iv.iv.i-p69"></span>But let us examine the nature even of the
meats themselves. For there indeed it is necessary to burst one’s self
with the large quantity of wine, even against one’s will, but here none
who is disinclined need eat or drink. So that there indeed the pleasure
arising from the quality of the food is cancelled by the dishonor which
precedes, and the discomfort which follows the surfeit. For not less
than hunger doth surfeiting destroy and rack our bodies; but even far
more grievously; and whomsoever you like to give me, I shall more easily
destroy by bursting him with surfeit than by hunger. For thus the latter
is easier to be borne than the other, for one might indeed endure hunger
for twenty days, but surfeiting not for as many as two only. And the
country people who are perpetually struggling with the one, are healthy,
and need no physicians; but the other, surfeiting I mean, none can
endure without perpetually calling in physicians; yea, rather, its
tyranny hath often baffled even their attempt to rescue.

<span id="iv.iv.i-p70"></span>So far then as pleasure is concerned, this
\[table of mine\] hath the advantage. For if honor hath more pleasure
than dishonor, if authority than subjection, and if manly confidence
than trembling and fear, and if enjoyment of what is enough, than to be
plunged out of depth in the tide of luxury; on the score of pleasure
this table is better than the other. It is besides better in regard of
expense; for the other is expensive, but this, not so.

<span id="iv.iv.i-p71"></span>But what? is it then to the guests alone
that this table is the more pleasurable, or bringeth it more pleasure
than the other to him who inviteth them, as well? for this is what we
are enquiring after rather. Now he who invites those makes preparation
many days before, and is forced to have trouble and anxious thoughts and
cares, neither sleeping by night, nor resting by day; but forming with
himself many plans, conversing with cooks, confectioners, deckers of
tables. Then when the very day is come, one may see him in greater fear
than those who are going to fight a boxing match, lest aught should turn
out other than was expected, lest he be shot with the glance of envy,
lest he thereby procure himself a multitude of accusers. But the other
escapeth all this anxious thought and trouble by extemporizing his
table, and not being careful about it for many days before. And then,
truly, after this, the former indeed hath straightway lost the grateful
return; but the other hath God for his Debtor; and is nourished with
good hopes, being every day feasted from off that table. For the meats
indeed are spent, but the grateful thought is never spent, but every day
he rejoices <span id="page_262">p. 262</span> <span
id="iv.iv.i-Page_262"></span>and exults more than they that are gorged
with their excess of wine. For nothing doth so nourish the soul as a
virtuous hope, and the expectation of good things.

<span id="iv.iv.i-p72"></span>But now let us consider what follows.
There indeed are flutes, and harps, and pipes; but here is no music of
sounds unsuitable; but what? hymns, singing of psalms. There indeed the
Demons are hymned; but here, the Lord of all, God. Seest thou with what
gratitude this one aboundeth, with what ingratitude and insensibility
that? For, tell me, when God hath nourished thee with His good things,
and when thou oughtest to give Him thanks after being fed, dost thou
even introduce the Demons? For these songs to the lyre, are none other
than songs to Demons. When thou oughtest to say, “Blessed art Thou, O
Lord, that Thou hast nourished me with Thy good things,” dost thou like
a worthless dog not even so much as remember Him, but, over and above,
introducest the Demons? Nay rather, dogs, whether they receive anything
or not, fawn upon those they know, but thou dost not even this. The dog,
although he receives nothing, fawns upon his master; but thou, even when
thou hast received, barkest at Him. Again, the dog, even though he be
well treated by a stranger, not even so will be reconciled of his hatred
of him, nor be enticed on to be friends with him: but thou, even though
suffering mischief incalculable from the Demons, introducest them at thy
feasts. So that, in two ways, thou art worse than the dog. And the
mention I have now made of dogs is happy, in regard of those who give
thanks then only when they receive a benefit. Take shame, I pray you, at
the dogs, which when famishing still fawn upon their masters. But thou,
if thou hast haply heard that the Demon has cured anyone, straightway
forsakest thy Master; O more unreasoning than the dogs!

<span id="iv.iv.i-p73"></span>But, saith one, the harlots are a pleasure
to look upon. What sort of pleasure are they? yea rather what infamy are
they not? Thy house has become a brothel, madness, and fury; and art
thou not ashamed to call this pleasure? If then it be allowed to use
them, <span id="fr_706"></span>[707](#fn_706.md) greater than all pleasure
is the shame, and the discomfort which arises from the shame, to make
one’s house a brothel, like hogs in wallowing in the mire? But if so far
only be allowed as to see them, lo! again the pain is greater. For to
see is no pleasure, where to use is not allowed, but the lust becomes
only the greater, and the flame the fiercer.

<span id="iv.iv.i-p75"></span>But wouldest thou learn the end? Those,
indeed, when they rise up from the table, are like the madmen and those
that have lost their wits; foolhardy, quarrelsome, laughing-stocks for
the very slaves; and the servants indeed retire sober, but these, drunk.
O the shame! But with the other is nothing of this sort; but closing the
table with thanksgiving, they so retire to their homes, with pleasure
sleeping, with pleasure waking, free from all shame and accusation.

<span id="iv.iv.i-p76"></span>If thou wilt consider also the guests
themselves, thou wilt see that the one are within just what the others
are without; blind, maimed, lame; and as are the bodies of these, such
are the souls of those, laboring under dropsy and inflammation. For of
such sort is pride; for after the luxurious gratification a maiming
takes place; of such sort is surfeiting and drunkenness, making men lame
and maimed. And thou wilt see too that these have souls like the bodies
of the others, brilliant, ornamented. For they who live in giving of
thanks, who seek nothing beyond a sufficiency, they whose philosophy is
of this sort are in all brightness.

<span id="iv.iv.i-p77"></span>But let us see the end both here and
there. There, indeed, is unchaste pleasure, loose laughter, drunkenness,
buffoonery, filthy language; (for since they in their own persons are
ashamed to talk filthily, this is brought about by means of the
harlots;) but here is love of mankind, gentleness. Near to him who
invites those stands vainglory arming him, but near the other, love of
man, and gentleness. For the one table, love of man prepareth, but the
other, vainglory, and cruelty, out of injustice and grasping. And that
one ends in what I have said, in loss of wits, in delirium, in madness;
(for such are the offshoots of vainglory;) but this one in thanksgiving
and the glory of God. And the praise too, which cometh of men, attendeth
more abundantly upon this; for that man is even regarded with an envious
eye, but this all men regard as their common father, even they who have
received no benefit at his hands. And as with the injured even they who
have not been injured sympathize, and all become in common enemies (to
the injurer): so too, when some receive kindness, they also who have not
received any, not less than they who have, praise and admire him that
conferred it. And there indeed is much envy, but here much tender
solicitude, many prayers from all.

<span id="iv.iv.i-p78"></span>And so much indeed here; but There, when
Christ is come, this one indeed shall stand with much boldness, and
shall hear before the whole world, “Thou sawest Me an hungered, and
didst feed Me; naked, and didst clothe Me; a stranger, and didst take Me
in” ([Matt. xxv. 35](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#035.md)<span
id="iv.iv.i-p78.1"></span>.); and all the like words: but the other
shall hear the contrary; “Wicked and slothful servant” ([Matt. xxv.
26](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#026)<span id="iv.iv.i-p78.2"></span>..md);
and again, “Woe unto them that luxuriate upon their couches, and sleep
upon beds of ivory, and drink the refined wine, <span id="page_263">p.
263</span> <span id="iv.iv.i-Page_263"></span>and anoint themselves with
the chief ointments; they counted upon these things as staying, and not
as fleeting.” ([Amos 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#004.md),
[5](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#005.md),
[6](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#006.md)<span id="iv.iv.i-p78.3"></span>,
Sept.)

<span id="iv.iv.i-p79"></span>I have not said this without purpose, but
with the view of changing your minds; and that you should do nothing
that is fruitless. What then, saith one, of the fact that I do both the
one and the other? This argument is much resorted to by all. And what
need, tell me, when everything might be done usefully, to make a
division, and to expend part on what is not wanted, but even without any
purpose at all, and part usefully? Tell me, hadst thou, when sowing,
cast some upon a rock, and some upon very good ground; is it likely that
thou wouldest have been contented so, and have said, Where is the harm,
if we cast some to no purpose, and some upon very good ground? For why
not all into the very good ground? Why lessen the gain? And if thou have
occasion to be getting money together, thou wilt not talk in that way,
but wilt get it together from every quarter; but in the other case thou
dost not so. And if to lend on usury; thou wilt not say, “Wherefore
shall we give some to the poor, and some to the rich,” but all is given
to the former: <span id="fr_707"></span>[708](#fn_707.md) yet in the case
before us, where the gain is so great, thou dost not thus calculate, and
will not at length desist from expending without purpose, and laying out
without return?

<span id="iv.iv.i-p81"></span>“But,” saith one, “this also hath a gain.”
Of what kind, tell me? “It increaseth friendships.” Nothing is colder
than men who are made friends by these things, by the table, and
surfeiting. The friendships of parasites are born only from that source.

<span id="iv.iv.i-p82"></span>Insult not a thing so marvelous as
love, <span id="fr_708"></span>[709](#fn_708.md) nor say that this is its
root. As if one were to say, that a tree which bore gold and precious
stones had not its root of the same, but that it was gendered of
rottenness; so doest even thou: for even though friendship should be
born from that source, nothing could possibly be colder. But those other
tables produce friendship, not with man, but with God; and that an
intense <span id="fr_709"></span>[710](#fn_709.md) one, so thou be intent
on preparing them. For he that expendeth part in this way and part in
that, even should he have bestowed much, hath done no great thing: but
he that expendeth all in this way, even though he should have given
little, hath done the whole. For what is required is that we give, not
much or little, but not less than is in our power. Think we on him with
the five talents, and on him with the two. ([Matt. xxv.
15](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#015)<span id="iv.iv.i-p84.1"></span>..md)
Think we on her who cast in those two mites. ([Mark xii.
41](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#041)<span id="iv.iv.i-p84.2"></span>..md)
Think we on the widow in Elijah’s days. She who threw in those two mites
said not, What harm if I keep the one mite for myself, and give the
other? but gave her whole living. ([1 Kings
xvii](../../../bib/kjv/kg1017.htm#000)<span id="iv.iv.i-p84.3"></span>..md)
But thou, in the midst of so great plenty, art more penurious than she.
Let us then not be careless of our own salvation, but apply ourselves to
almsgiving. For nothing is better than this, as the time to come shall
show; meanwhile the present shows it also. Live we then to the glory of
God, and do those things that please Him, that we may be counted worthy
of the good things of promise; which may all we obtain, through the
grace and love toward man of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory
and the power and honor, now and ever, and world without end. Amen.
