<span id="v.v.i-p8"></span><span class="c10"><span

<span id="v.v.i-p9"></span><span id="v.v.i-p9.1"></span><span
class="c1"><span id="v.v.i-p9.2"></span>[Titus i.
1-4](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#001.md)<span
id="v.v.i-p9.3"></span></span>

<span id="v.v.i-p10"></span>“Paul, a servant of God, and an Apostle of
Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God’s elect, and the
acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness; In hope of eternal
life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began; But
hath in due times manifested His word through preaching, which is
committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour; To
Titus, mine own son after the common faith; Grace, mercy, and peace,
from God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.”

<span id="v.v.i-p11"></span><span class="c13"><span
id="v.v.i-p11.1"></span>Titus</span> was an approved one of the
companions of Paul; otherwise, he would not have committed to him the
charge of that whole island, nor would he have commanded him to supply
what was deficient, as he says, “That thou shouldest set in order the
things that are wanting.” ([Titus
1.5](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#005)<span id="v.v.i-p11.2"></span>..md) He
would not have given him jurisdiction over so many Bishops, if he had
not placed great confidence in him. They say that he also was a young
man, because he calls him his son, though this does not prove it. I
think that there is mention made of him in the Acts. <span
id="fr_1443"></span>[1444](#fn_1443.md) Perhaps he was a Corinthian, unless
there was some other of the same name. And he summons Zenas, and orders
Apollos to be sent to him, never Titus. ([Tit. iii.
13](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#013)<span id="v.v.i-p12.3"></span>..md) For
he also attests their superior virtue and courage in the presence of the
Emperor.

<span id="v.v.i-p13"></span>Some time seems to have since elapsed, and
Paul, when he wrote this Epistle, appears to have been at liberty. For
he says nothing about his trials, but dwells continually upon the grace
of God, as being a sufficient encouragement to believers to persevere in
virtue. For to learn what they had deserved, and to what state they had
been transferred, and that by grace, and what had been vouchsafed them,
was no little encouragement. He takes aim also against the Jews, and if
he censures the whole nation, we need not wonder, for he does the same
in the case of the Galatians, saying, “O foolish Galatians.” ([Gal. iii.
1](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#001)<span id="v.v.i-p13.1"></span>..md) And
this does not proceed from a censorious temper, but from affection. For
if it were done for his own sake, one might fairly blame him; but if
from the fervor of his zeal for the Gospel, it was not done
reproachfully. Christ too, on many occasions, reproached the Scribes and
Pharisees, not on his own account, but because they were the ruin of all
the rest.

<span id="v.v.i-p14"></span>And he writes a short Epistle, with good
reason, and this is a proof of the virtue of Titus, that he did not
require many words, but a short remembrance. But this Epistle seems to
have been written before that to Timothy, for that he <span
id="page_520">p. 520</span> <span id="v.v.i-Page_520"></span>wrote as
near his end and in prison, but here, as free and at liberty. For his
saying, “I have determined to winter at Nicopolis” ([Tit. iii.
12](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#012)<span id="v.v.i-p14.1"></span>..md), is
a proof that he was not yet in bonds, as when he wrote to Timothy.

<span id="v.v.i-p15"></span>[Tit.
1.1](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#001.md)<span id="v.v.i-p15.1"></span>.
“Paul, a servant of God, and an Apostle of Jesus Christ, according to
the faith of God’s elect.”

<span id="v.v.i-p16"></span>You observe how he uses these expressions
indifferently, sometimes calling himself the “servant of God,” and
sometimes the “servant of Christ,” thus making no difference between the
Father and the Son.

<span id="v.v.i-p17"></span>“According to the faith of God’s elect, and
the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness. In hope of
eternal life.”

<span id="v.v.i-p18"></span>“According to the faith of God’s elect.” It
is because thou hast believed, or rather because thou wast intrusted? I
think he meant, that he was intrusted with God’s elect, that is, not for
any achievements of mine, nor from my toils and labors, did I receive
this dignity. It was wholly the effect of His goodness who intrusted me.
Yet that the grace may not seem without reason, (for still the whole was
not of Him, for why did He not intrust it to others?) he therefore adds,
“And the acknowledging of the truth that is after godliness.” For it was
for this acknowledgment that I was intrusted, or rather it was of His
grace that this too was intrusted to me, for He was the author of this
also. Whence Christ Himself said, “Ye have not chosen Me, but I have
chosen you.” ([John xv. 16](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#016.md)<span
id="v.v.i-p18.1"></span>.) And elsewhere this same blessed one writes,
“I shall know, even as also I am known.” ([1 Cor. xiii.
12](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#012)<span id="v.v.i-p18.2"></span>..md) And
again, “If I may apprehend that, for which also I am apprehended of
Christ Jesus.” ([Philip. iii. 12](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#012.md)<span
id="v.v.i-p18.3"></span>.) First we are apprehended, and afterwards we
know: first we are known, and then we apprehend: <span
id="fr_1444"></span>[1445](#fn_1444.md) first we were called, and then we
obeyed. But in saying, “according to the faith of the elect,” all is
reckoned to them, because on their account I am an Apostle, not for my
worthiness, but “for the elect’s sake.” As he elsewhere says, “All
things are yours, whether Paul, or Apollos.” ([1 Cor. iii.
21](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#021)<span id="v.v.i-p19.1"></span>..md)

<span id="v.v.i-p20"></span>“And the acknowledging the truth that is
after godliness.” For there is a truth in other things, that is not
according to godliness; for knowledge in matters of agriculture,
knowledge of the arts, is true knowledge; but this truth is after
godliness. Or this, “according to faith,” means that they believed, as
the other elect believed, and acknowledged the truth. This acknowledging
then is from faith, and not from reasonings.

<span id="v.v.i-p21"></span>“In hope of eternal life.” He spoke of the
present life, which is in the grace of God, and he also speaks of the
future, and sets before us the rewards that follow the mercies which God
has bestowed upon us. For He is willing to crown us because we have
believed, and have been delivered from error. Observe how the
introduction is full of the mercies of God, and this whole Epistle is
especially of the same character, thus exciting the holy man himself,
and his disciples also, to greater exertions. For nothing profits us so
much as constantly to remember the mercies of God, whether public or
private. And if our hearts are warmed when we receive the favors of our
friends, or hear some kind word or deed of theirs, much more shall we be
zealous in His service when we see into what dangers we had fallen, and
that God has delivered us from them all.

<span id="v.v.i-p22"></span>“And the acknowledging of the truth.” This
he says with reference to the type. For that was an “acknowledging” and
a “godliness,” yet not of the Truth, <span
id="fr_1445"></span>[1446](#fn_1445.md) yet neither was it falsehood, it
was godliness, but it was in type and figure. And he has well said, “In
hope of eternal life.” For the former was in hope of the present life.
For it is said, “he that doeth these things shall live in them.” ([Rom.
x. 5](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#005)<span id="v.v.i-p23.3"></span>..md)
You see how at the beginning he sets forth the difference of grace. They
are not the elect, but we. For if they were once called the elect, yet
are they no longer called so.

<span id="v.v.i-p24"></span>[Tit.
1.2](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#002.md)<span id="v.v.i-p24.1"></span>.
“Which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began.”

<span id="v.v.i-p25"></span>That is, not now upon a change of mind, but
from the beginning it was so foreordained. This he often asserts, as
when he says, “Separated unto the Gospel of God.” ([Rom. i.
1](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#001)<span id="v.v.i-p25.1"></span>..md) And
again, “Whom He did foreknow, He also did predestinate.” ([Rom. viii.
29](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#029)<span id="v.v.i-p25.2"></span>..md)
Thus showing our high origin, in that He did not love us now first, but
from the beginning: and it is no little matter to be loved of old, and
from the beginning.

<span id="v.v.i-p26"></span>“Which God, that cannot lie, promised.” If
He “cannot lie,” what He has promised will assuredly be fulfilled. If He
“cannot lie,” we ought not to doubt it, though it be after death. “Which
God, that cannot lie,” he says, “promised before the world began”; by
this also, “before the world began,” he shows that it is worthy of our
belief. It is not because the Jews have not come in, that these things
are promised. It had been so planned from the first. Hear therefore what
he says,

<span id="v.v.i-p27"></span>“But hath in His own <span
id="fr_1446"></span>[1447](#fn_1446.md) times manifested.”

<span id="v.v.i-p29"></span>Wherefore then was the delay? From His <span
id="page_521">p. 521</span> <span id="v.v.i-Page_521"></span>concern for
men, and that it might be done at a seasonable time. “It is time for
Thee, Lord, to work” ([Ps. cxix.
125](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#125)<span id="v.v.i-p29.1"></span>..md),
says the Prophet. For by “His own <span
id="fr_1447"></span>[1448](#fn_1447.md) times” is meant the suitable times,
the due, the fitting.

<span id="v.v.i-p31"></span>[Tit.
1.3](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#003.md)<span id="v.v.i-p31.1"></span>.
“But hath in due times manifested His word through preaching, which is
committed unto me.”

<span id="v.v.i-p32"></span>That is, the preaching is committed unto me.
For this included everything, the Gospel, and things present, and things
future, life, and godliness, and faith, and all things at once. “Through
preaching,” that is, openly and with all boldness, for this is the
meaning of “preaching.” For as a herald proclaims <span
id="fr_1448"></span>[1449](#fn_1448.md) in the theater in the presence of
all, so also we preach, adding nothing, but declaring the things which
we have heard. For the excellence of a herald consists in proclaiming to
all what has really happened, not in adding or taking away anything. If
therefore it is necessary to preach, it is necessary to do it with
boldness of speech. Otherwise, it is not preaching. On this account
Christ did not say, Tell it “upon the housetops,” but “preach upon the
housetops” ([Matt. x. 27](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#027.md)<span
id="v.v.i-p33.1"></span>.); showing both by the place and by the manner
what was to be done.

<span id="v.v.i-p34"></span>“Which is committed unto me according to the
commandment of God our Saviour.”

<span id="v.v.i-p35"></span>The expressions, “committed unto me,” and
“according to the commandment,” show the matter to be worthy of credit,
so that no one should think it discreditable, nor be hesitating about
it, or discontented. If then it is a commandment, it is not at my
disposal. I fulfill what is commanded. For of things to be done, some
are in our power, others are not. For what He commands, that is not in
our power, what He permits, is left to our choice. For instance,
“Whosoever shall say to his brother, Thou fool, shall be in danger of
hell fire.” ([Matt. v. 22](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#022.md)<span
id="v.v.i-p35.1"></span>.) This is a commandment. And again, “If thou
bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath
aught against thee, leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy
way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy
gift.” ([Matt. 5:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#023.md),
[24](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#024)<span id="v.v.i-p35.2"></span>..md)
This also is a command. But when He says, “If thou wilt be perfect, go
and sell all that thou hast” ([Matt. xix.
21](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#021)<span id="v.v.i-p35.3"></span>..md):
and, “He that is able to receive it, let him receive it” ([Matt. xix.
12](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#012)<span id="v.v.i-p35.4"></span>..md):
this is not a command, for He makes His hearer the disposer of the
matter, and leaves him the choice, whether he will do it or not. For
these things we may either do or not do. But commandments are not left
to our choice, we must either perform them, or be punished for not doing
so. This is implied when he says, “Necessity is laid upon me; yea woe is
unto me, if I preach not the Gospel.” ([1 Cor. ix.
16](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#016)<span id="v.v.i-p35.5"></span>..md)
This I will state more plainly, that it may be manifest to all. For
instance, He that is intrusted with the government of the Church, and
honored with the office of a Bishop, if he does not declare to the
people what they ought to do, will have to answer for it. But the layman
is under no such obligation. On this account Paul also says, “According
to the commandment of God our Saviour,” I do this. And see how the
epithets fit in to what I have said. For having said above, “God who
cannot lie,” here he says, “According to the commandment of God our
Saviour.” If then He is our Saviour, and He commanded these things with
a view that we should be saved, it is not from a love of command. It is
a matter of faith, and the commandment of God our Saviour.

<span id="v.v.i-p36"></span>“To Titus mine own <span
id="fr_1449"></span>[1450](#fn_1449.md) son,” that is, my true son. For it
is possible for men not to be true sons, as he of whom he says, “If any
man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an
idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, with such an one no not to eat.”
([1 Cor. v. 11](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#011.md)<span
id="v.v.i-p37.1"></span>.) Here is a son, <span
id="fr_1450"></span>[1451](#fn_1450.md) but not a true son. A son indeed he
is, because he has once received the grace, and has been regenerated:
but he is not a true son, because he is unworthy of his Father, and a
deserter to the usurped sovereignty of another. For in children by
nature, the true and the spurious are determined by the father that
begot, and the mother who bore them. But it is not so in this case, but
it depends on the disposition. For one who was a true son may become
spurious, and a spurious son may become a true one. For it is not the
force of nature, but the power of choice, on which it depends, whence it
is subject to frequent changes. Onesimus was a true son, but he was
again not true, for he became “unprofitable”; then he again became a
true son, so as to be called by the Apostle his “own bowels.” ([Philem.
12](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#012)<span id="v.v.i-p38.1"></span>..md)

<span id="v.v.i-p39"></span>[Tit.
1.4](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#004.md)<span id="v.v.i-p39.1"></span>. “To
Titus, mine own son after the common faith.”

<span id="v.v.i-p40"></span>What is “after the common faith”? After he
had called him his own son, and assumed the dignity of a father, hear
how it is that he lessens and lowers that honor. He adds, “After the
common faith”; that is, with respect to the faith I have no advantage
over thee; for it is common, and both thou and I were born by it. Whence
then does he call him his son? Either only wishing to express his
affection for him, or his priority in the Gospel, or to show that Titus
had been enlightened by him. On this account he calls the faithful both
children and brethren; <span id="page_522">p. 522</span> <span
id="v.v.i-Page_522"></span>brethren, because they were born by the same
faith; children, because it was by his hands. By mentioning the common
faith, therefore, he intimates their brotherhood.

<span id="v.v.i-p41"></span>[Tit.
1.4](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#004.md)<span id="v.v.i-p41.1"></span>.
“Grace and peace from God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ our
Saviour.”

<span id="v.v.i-p42"></span>Because he had called him his son, he adds,
“from God the Father,” to elevate his mind by showing whose son he was,
and by not only naming the common faith, but by adding “our Father,” he
implies that he has this honor equally with himself. <span
class="c16"><span id="v.v.i-p42.1"></span>Moral</span>. Observe also how
he offers the same prayers for the Teacher, as for the disciples and the
multitude. For indeed he needs such prayers as much, or rather more than
they, by how much he has greater enmities to encounter, and is more
exposed to the necessity of offending God. For the higher is the
dignity, the greater are the dangers of the priestly office. For one
good act in his episcopal office is sufficient to raise him to heaven
and one error to sink him to hell itself. For, to pass over all other
cases of daily occurrence, if he happens, either from friendship or any
other cause, to have advanced an unworthy person to a Bishopric, and
have committed to him the rule of a great city, see to how great a flame
he renders himself obnoxious. For not only will he have to account for
the souls that are lost, for they are lost through the man’s irreligion,
but for all that is done amiss by the other. For he that is irreligious
in a private station will be much more so when he is raised to power. It
is much indeed, if a pious man continue such after his elevation to
rule. For he is then more strongly assailed by vainglory, and the love
of wealth, and self-will, when office gives him the power; and by
offenses, insults, and reproaches, and numberless other evils. If
therefore any one be irreligious, he will become more so when raised to
office; and he who appoints such a ruler will be answerable for all the
offenses committed by him, and for the whole people. But if it is said
of him who gives offense to one soul, “It were better for him that a
millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the
depth of the sea” ([Matt. xviii.
6](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#006)<span id="v.v.i-p42.2"></span>..md);
what will he have to suffer who offends so many souls, whole cities and
populations, and multitudes of families, <span
id="fr_1451"></span>[1452](#fn_1451.md) men, women, children, citizens, and
husbandmen, the inhabitants of the city itself, and of all places
subject to it? To say thrice as much more is to say nothing, so severe
is the vengeance and the punishment to which he will be obnoxious. So
that a Bishop especially needs the grace and peace of God. For if
without these he governs the people, all is ruined and lost, for want of
those helms. And though he be skilled in the art of steering, he will
sink the vessel and those that sail in it, if he has not these helms,
“the grace and peace of God.”

<span id="v.v.i-p44"></span>Hence I am struck with astonishment at those
who desire so great a burden. Wretched and unhappy man, seest thou what
it is thou desirest? If thou art by thyself, unknown and
undistinguished, though thou committest ten thousand faults, thou hast
only one soul for which to give an account, and for it alone wilt thou
be answerable. But when thou art raised to this office, consider for how
many persons thou art obnoxious to punishment. Hear what Paul says,
“Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they
watch for your souls as they that must give account.” ([Heb. xiii.
17](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#017)<span id="v.v.i-p44.1"></span>..md) But
dost thou desire honor and power? But what pleasure is there in this
honor? I confess, I see not. For to be a ruler indeed is not possible,
since it depends upon those under thy rule to obey or not. And to any
one who considers the matter closely; it will appear that a Bishop does
not so much come to rule, as to serve a multitude of masters, who are of
opposite desires and sentiments. For what one commends, another blames;
what this man censures, that admires. To whom therefore shall he listen,
with whom shall he comply? It is impossible! And the slave that is
bought with money complains if his master’s commands are contrary to
each other. But shouldest thou grieve, when so many masters give the
contrary orders, thou art condemned even for this, and all mouths are
opened against thee. Tell me then, is this honor, is this rule, is this
power?

<span id="v.v.i-p45"></span>One who holds the Episcopal office has
required a contribution of money. He who is unwilling to contribute not
only withholds it, but that he may not seem to withhold it from
indifference, he accuses his Bishop. He is a thief, he says, a robber,
he engulfs the goods of the poor, he devours the rights of the needy.
Cease thy calumnies! How long wilt thou say these things? Wilt thou not
contribute? No one compels thee, there is no constraint. Why dost thou
revile him who counsels and advises thee? Is any one reduced to need,
and he from inability, or some other hindrance, has not lent a hand? No
allowance is made for him, the reproaches in this case are worse than in
the other. This then is government! And he cannot avenge himself. For
they are his own bowels, and as though the bowels be swollen, and though
they give pain to the head and the rest of the body, we venture not on
revenge, we cannot take a sword and pierce them; so if one of those
under our rule be of such sort, and create trouble and disorder by these
accusations, we dare not avenge ourselves, for this would be far from
the <span id="page_523">p. 523</span> <span
id="v.v.i-Page_523"></span>disposition of a father, but we must endure
the grief till he becomes sound and well.

<span id="v.v.i-p46"></span>The slave bought with money has an appointed
work, which when he has performed, he is afterwards his own master. But
the Bishop is distracted on every side and is expected to do many things
that are beyond his power. If he knows not how to speak, there is great
murmuring; and if he can speak, then he is accused of bring
vainglorious. If he cannot raise the dead, he is of no worth, they say:
such an one is pious, but this man is not. If he eats a moderate meal,
for this he is accused, he ought to be strangled, they say. If he is
seen at the bath, <span id="fr_1452"></span>[1453](#fn_1452.md) he is much
censured. In short, he ought not to look upon the sun! If he does the
same things that I do, if he bathes, eats and drinks, and wears the same
clothing, and has the care of a house and servants, on what account is
he set over me? But he has domestics to minister to him, and an ass to
ride upon, why then is he set over me? But say, ought he then to have no
one to wait upon him? Ought he himself to light his own fire, to draw
water, to cleave wood, to go to market? How great a degradation would
this be! Even the holy Apostles would not that any ministers of the word
should attend upon the tables of the widows, but they considered it a
business unworthy of them: and would you degrade them to the offices of
your own domestics? Why dost not thou, who commandest these things, come
and perform these services? Tell me, does not he minister to thee a
better service than thine, which is bodily? Why dost thou not send thy
domestic to wait upon him? Christ washed the feet of His disciples; is
it a great thing for thee to give this service to thy Teacher? But thou
art not willing to render it thyself, and thou grudgest it to him. Ought
he then to draw his livelihood from heaven? But God wills not so.

<span id="v.v.i-p48"></span>But you say, “Had the Apostles free men to
serve them?” Would you then hear how the Apostles lived? They made long
journeys, and free men and honorable women laid down their lives and
souls for their relief. But hear this blessed Apostle thus exhorting;
“Hold such in reputation” ([Phil.
2:29](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#029.md),
[30](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#030)<span id="v.v.i-p48.1"></span>..md):
and again, “Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not
regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.” See what
he says! but thou hast not a word to throw away upon thy spiritual
father, much less wilt thou submit to any danger in his behalf. But thou
sayest, “He ought not to frequent the bath.” And where is this
forbidden? there is nothing honorable in being unclean.

<span id="v.v.i-p49"></span>These are not the things we find blamed or
applauded at all. For the qualities which a Bishop is required to
possess are different, as to be blameless, sober, orderly, hospitable,
apt to teach. These the Apostle requires, and these we ought to look for
in a ruler of the Church, but nothing further. Thou art not more strict
than Paul, or rather more strict than the Spirit. If he be a striker, or
violent, or cruel, and unmerciful, accuse him. These things are unworthy
of a Bishop. If he be luxurious, this also is censurable. But if he
takes care of his body that he may minister to thee, if he attends to
his health that he may be useful, ought he for this to be accused?
Knowest thou not that bodily infirmity no less than infirmity of soul
injures both us and the Church? Why, otherwise, does Paul attend to this
matter, in writing to Timothy, “Use a little wine for thy stomach’s
sake, and thy often infirmities”? ([1 Tim. v.
23](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#023)<span id="v.v.i-p49.1"></span>..md) For
if we could practice virtue with the soul alone, we need not take care
of the body. And why then were we born at all? But if this has
contributed a great share, is it not the extreme of folly to neglect it?

<span id="v.v.i-p50"></span>For suppose a man honored with the
Bishopric, and intrusted with a public charge of the Church, and let him
in other respects be virtuous, and have every quality, which a priest
ought to possess, yet let him be always confined to his bed by reason of
great infirmity, what service will he be able to render? Upon what
mission can he go? what visitation can he undertake? whom can he rebuke
or admonish? These things I say, that you may learn not causelessly to
accuse him, but rather may receive him favorably; as also that if any
one desire rule in the Church, seeing the shower of abuse that attends
it, he may quench that desire. Great indeed is the danger of such a
station, and it requires “the grace and peace of God.” Which that we may
have abundantly, do you pray for us, and we for you, that practicing
virtue aright we may so obtain the blessings promised, through Jesus
Christ, with whom, &c.
