<span id="iii.iv.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c10"><span
id="iii.iv.xv-p1.1"></span>Homily XIV.</span>

<span id="iii.iv.xv-p2"></span><span id="iii.iv.xv-p2.1"></span><span
class="c1"><span id="iii.iv.xv-p2.2"></span>[Ephesians iv.
25-27](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#025.md)<span
id="iii.iv.xv-p2.3"></span></span>

<span id="iii.iv.xv-p3"></span>“Wherefore, putting away falsehood, speak
ye truth each one with his neighbor; for we are members one of another.
Be ye angry, and sin not; let not the sun go down upon your wrath:
neither give place to the devil.”

<span id="iii.iv.xv-p4"></span><span class="c13"><span
id="iii.iv.xv-p4.1"></span>Having</span> spoken of the “old man”
generally, he next draws him also in detail; <span
id="fr_334"></span>[335](#fn_334.md) for this kind of teaching is more
easily learned when we learn by particulars. And what saith he?
“Wherefore, putting away falsehood.” What sort of falsehood? Idols does
he mean? Surely not; not indeed but that they are falsehood also.
However, he is not now speaking of them, because these persons had
nothing to do with them; but he is speaking of that which passes between
one man and another, meaning that which is deceitful and false. “Speak
ye truth, each one,” saith he, “with his neighbor”; then what is more
touching to the conscience <span id="fr_335"></span>[336](#fn_335.md)
still, “because we are members one of another.” Let no man deceive his
neighbor. As the Psalmist says here and there; “With flattering lip and
with a double heart do they speak.” ([Ps. xii.
2](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#002)<span id="iii.iv.xv-p6.1"></span>..md)
For there is nothing, no, nothing so productive of enmity as deceit and
guile.

<span id="iii.iv.xv-p7"></span>Observe how everywhere he shames them by
this similitude of the body. Let not the eye, saith he, lie to the foot,
nor the foot to the eye. For example, if there shall be a deep pit, and
then by having reeds laid across upon the mouth of it upon the earth,
and yet concealed under earth, it shall by its appearance furnish to the
eye an expectation of solid ground, will not the eye use the foot, and
discover whether it yields <span id="fr_336"></span>[337](#fn_336.md) and
is hollow underneath, or whether it is firm and resists? <span
id="fr_337"></span>[338](#fn_337.md) Will the foot tell a lie, and not
report the truth as it is? And what again? If the eye were to spy a
serpent or a wild beast, will it lie to the foot? Will it not at once
inform it, and the foot thus informed by it refrain from going on? And
what again, when neither the foot nor the eye shall know how to
distinguish, but all shall depend upon the smelling, as, for example,
whether a drug be deadly or not; will the smelling lie to the mouth? And
why not? Because it will be destroying itself also. But it tells the
truth as it appears to itself. And what again? Will the tongue lie to
the stomach? Does it not, when a thing is bitter, reject it, and, if it
is sweet, pass it on? Observe ministration, and interchange of service;
observe a provident care arising from truth, and, as one might say,
spontaneously from the heart. So surely should it be with us also; let
us not lie, since we are “members one of another.” This is a sure token
of friendship; whereas the contrary is of enmity. What then, thou wilt
ask, if a man shall use treachery against thee? Hearken to the truth. If
he use treachery, he is not a member; whereas he saith, “lie not towards
the members.”

<span id="iii.iv.xv-p10"></span>“Be ye angry, and sin not.”

<span id="iii.iv.xv-p11"></span>Observe his wisdom. He both speaks to
prevent our sinning, and, if we do not listen, still <span
id="page_118">p. 118</span> <span id="iii.iv.xv-Page_118"></span>does
not forsake us; for his fatherly compassion does not desert him. For
just as the physician prescribes to the sick what he must do, and if he
does not submit to it, still does not treat him with contempt, but
proceeding to add what advice he can by persuasion, again goes on with
the cure; so also does Paul. For he indeed who does otherwise, aims only
at reputation, and is annoyed at being disregarded; whereas he who on
all occasions aims at the recovery of the patient, has this single
object in view, how he may restore the patient, and raise him up again.
This then is what Paul is doing. He has said, “Lie not.” Yet if ever
lying should produce anger, <span id="fr_338"></span>[339](#fn_338.md) he
goes on again to cure this also. For what saith he? “Be ye angry, and
sin not.” It were good indeed never to be angry. Yet if ever any one
should fall into passion, still let him not fall into so great a degree.
“For let not the sun,” saith he, “go down upon your wrath.” Wouldest
thou have thy fill of anger? One hour, or two, or three, is enough for
thee; let not the sun depart, and leave you both at enmity. It was of
God’s goodness that he rose: let him not depart, having shone on
unworthy men. For if the Lord of His great goodness sent him, and hath
Himself forgiven thee thy sins, and yet thou forgivest not thy neighbor,
look, how great an evil is this! And there is yet another besides this.
The blessed Paul dreads the night, <span
id="fr_339"></span>[340](#fn_339.md) lest overtaking in solitude him that
was wronged, still burning with anger, it should again kindle up the
fire. For as long as there are many things in the daytime to banish it,
thou art free to indulge it; but as soon as ever the evening comes on,
be reconciled, extinguish the evil whilst it is yet fresh; for should
night overtake it, the morrow will not avail to extinguish the further
evil which will have been collected in the night. Nay, even though thou
shouldest cut off the greater portion, and yet not be able to cut off
the whole, it will again supply from what is left for the following
night, to make the blaze more violent. And just as, should the sun be
unable by the heat of the day to soften and disperse that part of the
air which has been during the night condensed into cloud, it affords
material for a tempest, night overtaking the remainder, and feeding it
again with fresh vapors: so also is it in the case of anger.

<span id="iii.iv.xv-p14"></span>“Neither give place to the devil.”

<span id="iii.iv.xv-p15"></span>So then to be at war with one another,
is “to give place to the devil”; for, whereas we had need to be all in
close array, and to make our stand against him, we have relaxed our
enmity against him, and are giving the signal for turning against each
other; for never has the devil such *place* as in our enmities. <span
id="fr_340"></span>[341](#fn_340.md) Numberless are the evils thence
produced. And as stones in a building, so long as they are closely
fitted together and leave no interstice, will stand firm, while if there
is but a single needle’s passage through, or a crevice no broader than a
hair, this destroys and ruins all; so is it with the devil. So long
indeed as we are closely set and compacted together, he cannot introduce
one of his wiles; but when he causes us to relax a little, he rushes in
like a torrent. In every case he needs only a beginning, and this is the
thing which it is difficult to accomplish; but this done, he makes room
on all sides for himself. For henceforth he opens the ear to slanders,
and they who speak lies are the more trusted: they have enmity which
plays the advocate, not truth which judges justly. And as, where
friendship <span id="fr_341"></span>[342](#fn_341.md) is, even those evils
which are true appear false, so where there is enmity, even the false
appear true. There is a different mind, a different tribunal, which does
not hear fairly, but with great bias and partiality. As, in a balance,
if lead is cast into the scale, it will drag down the whole; so is it
also here, only that the weight of enmity is far heavier than any lead.
Wherefore, let us, I beseech you, do all we can to extinguish our
enmities before the going down of the sun. For if you fail to master it
on the very first day, both on the following, and oftentimes even for a
year, you will be protracting it, and the enmity will thenceforward
augment itself, and require nothing to aid it. For by causing us to
suspect that words spoken in one sense were meant in another, and
gestures also, and everything, it infuriates and exasperates us, and
makes us more distempered than madmen, not enduring either to utter a
name, or to hear it, but saying everything in invective and abuse. How
then are we to allay this passion? How shall we extinguish the flame? By
reflecting on our own sins, and how much we have to answer for to God;
by reflecting that we are wreaking vengeance, not on an enemy, but on
ourselves; by reflecting that we are delighting the devil, that we are
strengthening our enemy, our real <span id="page_119">p. 119</span>
<span id="iii.iv.xv-Page_119"></span>enemy, and that for him we are
doing wrong to our own members. Wouldest thou be revengeful and be at
enmity? Be at enmity, but be so with the devil, and not with a member of
thine own. For this purpose it is that God hath armed us with anger, not
that we should thrust the sword against our own bodies, but that we
should baptize <span id="fr_342"></span>[343](#fn_342.md) the whole blade
in the devil’s breast. There bury the sword up to the hilt; yea, if thou
wilt, hilt and all, and never draw it out again, but add yet another and
another. And this actually comes to pass when we are merciful to those
of our own spiritual family and peaceably disposed one towards another.
Perish money, perish glory and reputation; mine own member is dearer to
me than they all. Thus let us say to ourselves; let us not do violence
to our own nature to gain wealth, to obtain glory.

<span id="iii.iv.xv-p21"></span>[Eph.
4.28](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#028.md)<span
id="iii.iv.xv-p21.1"></span>. “Let him that stole,” <span
id="fr_343"></span>[344](#fn_343.md) saith he, “steal no more.”

<span id="iii.iv.xv-p23"></span>Seest thou what are the members of the
old man? Falsehood, revenge, theft. Why said he not, “Let him that
stole” be punished, be tortured, be racked; but, “let him steal no
more”? “But rather let him labor, working with his hands the thing that
is good, that he may have whereof to give to him that hath need.”

<span id="iii.iv.xv-p24"></span>Where are they which are called
pure; <span id="fr_344"></span>[345](#fn_344.md) they that are full of all
defilement, and yet dare to give themselves a name like this? For it is
possible, very possible, to put off the reproach, not only by ceasing
from the sin, but by working some good thing also. Perceive ye how we
ought to get quit of the sin? “They stole.” This is the sin. “They steal
no more.” This is not to do away the sin. But how shall they? If they
labor, and charitably communicate to others, thus will they do away the
sin. He does not simply desire that we should work, but so “work” as to
“labor,” so as that we may “communicate” to others. For the thief indeed
works, but it is that which is evil.

<span id="iii.iv.xv-p26"></span>[Eph.
4.29](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#029.md)<span
id="iii.iv.xv-p26.1"></span>. “Let no corrupt speech proceed out of your
mouth.”

<span id="iii.iv.xv-p27"></span>What is “corrupt speech”? That which is
said elsewhere to be also “idle, backbiting, filthy communication,
jesting, foolish talking.” See ye how he is cutting up the very roots of
anger? Lying, theft, unseasonable conversation. The words, however, “Let
him steal no more,” he does not say so much excusing them, as to pacify
the injured parties, and to recommend them to be content, if they never
suffer the like again. And well too does he give advice concerning
conversation; <span id="fr_345"></span>[346](#fn_345.md) inasmuch as we
shall pay the penalty, not for our deeds only, but also for our words.

<span id="iii.iv.xv-p29"></span>“But such as is good,” he proceeds, “for
edifying, as the need may be, that it may give grace to them that hear.”

<span id="iii.iv.xv-p30"></span>That is to say, What edifies thy
neighbor, that only speak, not a word more. For to this end God gave
thee a mouth and a tongue, that thou mightest give thanks to Him, that
thou mightest build up thy neighbor. So that if thou destroy that
building, better were it to be silent, and never to speak at all. For
indeed the hands of the workmen, if instead of raising the walls, they
should learn to pull them down, would justly deserve to be cut off. For
so also saith the Psalmist; “The Lord shall cut off all flattering
lips.” ([Ps. xii. 3](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#003.md)<span
id="iii.iv.xv-p30.1"></span>.) The mouth,—this is the cause of all evil;
or rather not the mouth, but they that make an evil use of it. From
thence proceed insults, revilings, blasphemies, incentives to lusts,
murders, adulteries, thefts, all have their origin from this. And how,
you will say, do murders? Because from insult thou wilt go on to anger,
from anger to blows, from blows to murder. And how, again, adultery?
“Such a woman,” one will say, “loves thee, she said something nice about
thee.” This at once unstrings thy firmness, and thus are thy passions
kindled within thee.

<span id="iii.iv.xv-p31"></span>Therefore Paul said, “such as is good.”
Since then there is so vast a flow of words, he with good reason speaks
indefinitely, charging us to use expressions of that kind, and giving us
a pattern of communication. What then is this? By saying, “for
edifying,” either he means this, that he who hears thee may be grateful
to thee: as, for instance, a brother has committed forni<span
id="page_120">p. 120</span> <span id="iii.iv.xv-Page_120"></span>cation;
do not make a display of the offense, nor revel in it; thou wilt be
doing no good to him that hears thee; rather, it is likely, thou wilt
hurt him, by giving him a stimulus. Whereas, advise him what to do, and
thou art conferring on him a great obligation. Discipline him how to
keep silence, teach him to revile no man, and thou hast taught him his
best lesson, thou wilt have conferred upon him the highest obligation.
Discourse with him on contrition, on piety, on almsgiving; all these
things will soften his soul, for all these things he will own his
obligation. Whereas by exciting his laughter, or by filthy
communication, thou wilt rather be inflaming him. Applaud the
wickedness, and thou wilt overturn and ruin him.

<span id="iii.iv.xv-p32"></span>Or else he means <span
id="fr_346"></span>[347](#fn_346.md) thus, “that it may make them, the
hearers, full of grace.” For as sweet ointment gives grace to them that
partake of it, so also does good speech. Hence it was moreover that one
said, “Thy name is as ointment poured forth.” ([Song of Sol.
1.3](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#003.md)<span
id="iii.iv.xv-p33.1"></span>.) It caused them to exhale that sweet
perfume. Thou seest that what he continually recommends, he is saying
now also, charging every one according to his several ability to edify
his neighbors. Thou then that givest such advice to others, how much
more to thyself!

<span id="iii.iv.xv-p34"></span>[Eph.
4.30](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#030.md)<span
id="iii.iv.xv-p34.1"></span>. “And grieve not,” he adds, “the Holy
Spirit of God.”

<span id="iii.iv.xv-p35"></span>A matter this more terrible and
startling, as he also says in the Epistle to the Thessalonians; for
there too he uses an expression of this sort. “He that rejecteth,
rejecteth not man, but God.” ([1 Thess. iv.
8](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#008)<span id="iii.iv.xv-p35.1"></span>..md)
So also here. If thou utter a reproachful word, if thou strike thy
brother, thou art not striking him, thou art “grieving the Holy Spirit.”
And then is added further the benefit bestowed, in order to heighten the
rebuke.

<span id="iii.iv.xv-p36"></span>“And grieve not the Holy Spirit,” saith
He, “in whom ye were sealed unto the day of redemption.”

<span id="iii.iv.xv-p37"></span>He it is who marks us as a royal flock;
He, who separates us from all former things; He, who suffers us not to
lie amongst them that are exposed to the wrath of God,—and dost thou
grieve Him? Look how startling are his words there; “For he that
rejecteth,” saith he, “rejecteth not man, but God:” and how cutting they
are here, “Grieve not the Holy Spirit,” saith he, “in whom ye were
sealed.”

<span id="iii.iv.xv-p38"></span><span class="c13"><span
id="iii.iv.xv-p38.1"></span>Moral</span>. Let this seal then abide upon
thy mouth, <span id="fr_347"></span>[348](#fn_347.md) and never destroy the
impression. A spiritual mouth never utters a thing of the kind. Say not,
“It is nothing, if I do utter an unseemly word, if I do insult such an
one.” For this very reason is it a great evil, because it seems to be
nothing. For things which seem to be nothing are thus easily thought
lightly of; and those which are thought lightly of go on increasing; and
those which go on increasing become incurable.

<span id="iii.iv.xv-p40"></span>Thou hast a spiritual mouth. Think what
words thou didst utter immediately upon being born, <span
id="fr_348"></span>[349](#fn_348.md) —what words are worthy of thy mouth.
Thou callest God, “Father,” and dost thou straightway revile thy
brother? Think, whence is it thou callest God, “Father”? Is it from
nature? No, thou couldest never say so. Is it from thy goodness? No, nor
is it thus. But whence then is it? It is from pure lovingkindness, from
tenderness, from His great mercy. Whenever then thou callest God,
“Father,” consider not only this, that by reviling thou art committing
things unworthy of that, thy high birth, but also that it is of
lovingkindness that thou hast that high birth. Disgrace it not then,
after receiving it from pure lovingkindness, by showing cruelty towards
thy brethren. Dost thou call God “Father,” and yet revile? No, these are
not the works of the Son of God. These are very far from Him. The work
of the Son of God was to forgive His enemies, to pray for them that
crucified Him, to shed His blood for them that hated Him. These are
works worthy of the Son of God, to make His enemies,—the ungrateful, the
dishonest, the reckless, the treacherous,—to make these brethren and
heirs: not to treat them that are become brethren with ignominy like
slaves.

<span id="iii.iv.xv-p42"></span> <span id="fr_349"></span>[350](#fn_349.md)
Think what words thy mouth uttered,—of what table these words are
worthy. Think what thy mouth touches, what it tastes, of what manner of
food it partakes! Dost thou deem thyself to be doing nothing grievous in
railing at thy brother? How then dost thou call him brother? And yet if
he be not a brother, how sayest thou, “Our Father”? For the word “Our”
is indicative of many persons. Think with whom thou standest at the time
of the mysteries! With the Cherubim, with the Seraphim! The Seraphim
revile not: no, their mouth fulfills this one only duty, to sing the
Hymn of praise, to glorify <span id="fr_350"></span>[351](#fn_350.md) God.
And how then shalt thou be able to say with them, “Holy, Holy,
Holy,” <span id="fr_351"></span>[352](#fn_351.md) if thou use thy mouth for
reviling? Tell me, I pray. Suppose there were a royal vessel, and that
always full of royal dainties, and set apart for that <span
id="page_121">p. 121</span> <span
id="iii.iv.xv-Page_121"></span>purpose, and then that any one of the
servants were to take and use it for holding dung. Would he ever venture
again, after it had been filled with dung, to store it away with those
other vessels, set apart for those other uses? Surely not. Now railing
is like this, reviling is like this. “Our Father!” But what? is this
all? Hear also the words, which follow, “which art in Heaven.” The
moment thou sayest, “Our Father, which art in Heaven,” the word raises
thee up, it gives wings to thy mind, it points out to thee that thou
hast a Father in Heaven. Do then nothing, speak nothing of things upon
earth. He hath set thee amongst that host above, He hath numbered thee
with that heavenly choir. Why dost thou drag thyself down? Thou art
standing beside the royal throne, and thou revilest? Art thou not afraid
lest the king should deem it an outrage? Why, if a servant, even with
us, beats his fellow-servant or assaults him, even though he do it
justly, yet we at once rebuke him, and deem the act an outrage; and yet
dost thou, who art standing with the Cherubim beside the king’s throne,
revile thy brother? Seest thou not these holy vessels? Are they not used
continually for only one purpose? Does any one ever venture to use them
for any other? Yet art thou holier than these vessels, yea, far holier.
Why then defile, why contaminate thyself? Standest thou in Heaven, and
dost thou revile? Hast thou thy citizenship with Angels, and dost thou
revile? Art thou counted worthy the Lord’s kiss, and dost thou revile?
Hath God graced thy mouth with so many and great things, with hymns
angelic, with food, not angelic, no, but more than angelic, with His own
kiss, with His own embrace, and dost thou revile? Oh, no, I implore
thee. Vast are the evils of which this is the source; far be it from a
Christian soul. Do I not convince thee as I am speaking, do I not shame
thee? Then does it now become my duty to alarm you. For hear what Christ
saith: “Whosoever shall say to his brother, Thou fool, shall be in
danger of the hell of fire.” ([Matt. v.
22](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#022)<span id="iii.iv.xv-p45.1"></span>..md)
Now if that which is lightest of all leads to hell, of what shall not he
be worthy, who utters presumptuous words? Let us discipline our mouth to
silence. Great is the advantage from this, great the mischief from ill
language. We must not spend our riches here. Let us put door and bolt
upon them. Let us devour ourselves alive if ever a vexatious word slip
out of our mouth. Let us entreat God, let us entreat him whom we have
reviled. Let us not think it beneath us to do so. It is ourselves we
have wounded, not him. Let us apply the remedy, prayer, and
reconciliation with him whom we have reviled. If in our words we are to
take such forethought, much more let us impose laws upon ourselves in
our deeds. Yea, and if we have friends, whoever they may be, and they
should speak evil to any man or revile him, demand of them and exact
satisfaction. Let us by all means learn that such conduct is even sin;
for if we learn this, we shall soon depart from it.

<span id="iii.iv.xv-p46"></span>Now the God of peace keep both your mind
and your tongue, and fence you with a sure fence, even His fear, through
Jesus Christ our Lord, with whom to the Father, together with the Holy
Spirit, be glory forever. Amen.

title which the Novatians indirectly assumed, by maintaining that none
were in God’s favor but those who had not sinned after baptism, or who
were pure as baptism made them, and by separating from the Church for
granting absolution to penitents. The schism originated at Rome in the
middle of the third century. Accordingly St. Chrysostom in the text
says, that whereas all men need pardon continually, they who affected to
be clean or pure without securing it were, as being without it, of all
men most unclean. \[And he strongly asserts, as against the Novatians,
that it *is* possible to put away the guilt of sins committed after
baptism, by ceasing from the practice of them and working that which is
good. This view, however, differs from the Protestant view, that the
putting away the guilt of sin is at first and always through God’s mercy
and grace in Jesus Christ.—G.A.\] In the sixth of eleven new Homilies
edited by the Benedictines, t. xii. p. 355, he says that we may as well
talk of the sea being clear of waves as any soul pure from daily sins,
though not from transgressing express commandment, yet from vainglory,
willfulness, impure thoughts, coveting, lying, resentment, envy, &c.,
and he mentions as means of washing away sins, coming to Church,
grieving for them, confessing them, doing alms, praying, helping the
injured, and forgiving injuries. “Let us provide ourselves with these,”
he proceeds, “every day, washing, wiping ourselves clean, and withal
confessing ourselves unprofitable,” unlike the Pharisee. “Thus ordering
ourselves, we shall be able to find mercy and pardon in that fearful
day, &c.” This homily was delivered at Constantinople. \[On the
Novatians, see Schaff, *Church History*, II., pp. 196, 197.—G.A.\]

services and words used in connection therewith. Bingham says, “The
catechumens did not learn the creed and the Lord’s prayer till
immediately before baptism.” And Chrysostom says, “An unbaptized person
cannot yet call God his Father.” St. Augustine also says in one of his
homilies, “Now learn the Lord’s prayer, which ye must repeat eight days
hence, when ye are to be baptized.” So they received it (that is, the
Lord’s prayer) only on Saturday before Palm Sunday, in order to repeat
it on Saturday before Easter, which was the day of their baptism.
