<span id="iv.iii.xvi-p2"></span><span id="iv.iii.xvi-p2.1"></span><span
class="c1"><span id="iv.iii.xvi-p2.2"></span>[Philippians iv.
10-14](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#010.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xvi-p2.3"></span></span>

<span id="iv.iii.xvi-p3"></span>“But I rejoice in the Lord greatly, that
now at length ye have revived your thought for me; wherein ye did indeed
take thought, but ye lacked opportunity. Not that I speak in respect of
want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therein to be
content. I know how to be abused, and I know also how to abound: in
everything and in all things have I learned the secret both to be filled
and to be hungry, both to abound and to be in want. I can do all things
in him that strengtheneth me. Howbeit, ye did well, that ye had
fellowship with my affliction.”

<span id="iv.iii.xvi-p4"></span><span class="c13"><span
id="iv.iii.xvi-p4.1"></span>I have</span> ofttimes said, that almsgiving
hath been introduced not for the sake of the receivers, but of the
givers, for the latter are they which make the greatest gain. And this
Paul shows here also. In what way? The Philippians had sent him
somewhat, after a long time, and had committed the same to Epaphroditus.
See then, how when he is about to send Epaphroditus as the bearer of
this Epistle, he praises them, and shows that this action was for the
need, not of the receiver, but of the givers. This he doth, both that
they who benefited him may not be lifted up with arrogance, and that
they may become more zealous in well-doing, since they rather benefit
themselves; and that they who receive may not fearlessly rush forward to
receive, lest they meet with condemnation. For “it is more blessed,” He
saith, “to give than to receive.” ([Acts xx.
35](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#035)<span id="iv.iii.xvi-p4.2"></span>..md)
Why then does he say, “I rejoice in the Lord greatly”? Not with worldly
rejoicing, saith he, nor with the joy of this life, but in the Lord. Not
because I had refreshment, but because ye advanced; for this is my
refreshment. Wherefore he also saith “greatly”; since this joy was not
corporeal, nor on account of his own refreshment, but because of their
advancement.

<span id="iv.iii.xvi-p5"></span>And see how, when he had gently rebuked
them on account of the times that were passed, he quickly throweth a
shadow over this, and teacheth them constantly and always to remain in
well doing. “Because at length,” saith he. The words, “at length,” show
long time to have elapsed. “Ye have revived,” as fruits which have shot
forth, dried up, and afterwards shot forth. Here he showeth, that being
at first blooming, then having faded, they again budded forth. So that
the word “flourished again,” has both rebuke and praise. For it is no
small thing, that he who hath withered should flourish again. He showeth
also, that it was from indolence all this had happened to them. But here
he signifies, that even in former time they were wont to be zealous in
these things. Wherefore he addeth, “your thought for me, wherein ye did
indeed take thought.” And lest you should think, that in other things
too they had been more zealous, and had then withered, but in this thing
alone, behold how he has added, “your thought for me.” I apply the
words, “now at length,” only to this; for in other things it is not so.

<span id="iv.iii.xvi-p6"></span>Here some one may enquire, how when he
had said, “It is more blessed to give than to receive” ([Acts
20:25](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#025.md),
[34](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#034.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xvi-p6.1"></span>.); and, “These hands ministered to my
necessities, and to them that were with me”; and again when writing to
the Corinthians, “For it were good for me rather to <span
id="page_250">p. 250</span> <span id="iv.iii.xvi-Page_250"></span>die,
than that any man should make my glorying void” ([1 Cor. ix.
15](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#015.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xvi-p6.2"></span>.); he suffereth his glorying to be made
void? And how? By receiving. For if his glorying was, that he received
not, how doth he now endure so to do? What is it then? Probably, he then
did not receive on account of the false Apostles, “that wherein they
glory” ([2 Cor. xi. 12](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#012.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xvi-p6.3"></span>.), saith he, “they may be found even as
we.” And he said not “are,” but “glory”; for they received but secretly.
Wherefore he said, “wherein they glory.” Wherefore he also said, “No man
shall stop me of this glorying.” ([2 Cor. xi.
10](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#010)<span id="iv.iii.xvi-p6.4"></span>..md)
And he said not simply, shall not stop me, but what? “in the regions of
Achaia.” And again, “I robbed other Churches, taking wages of them that
I might minister unto you.” ([2 Cor. xi.
8](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#008)<span id="iv.iii.xvi-p6.5"></span>..md)
Here he showed that he did receive. But Paul indeed received rightly,
having so great a work; if in truth he did receive. But they who work
not, how can they receive? “Yet I pray,” saith one. But there is no
work. For this may be done together with work. “But I fast.” Neither is
this work. For see this blessed one, preaching in many places, and
working too. “But ye lacked opportunity.” What meaneth lacked
opportunity? It came not; saith he, of indolence, but of
necessity. <span id="fr_676"></span>[677](#fn_676.md) Ye had it not in your
hands, nor were in abundance. This is the meaning of, “Ye lacked
opportunity.” Thus most men speak, when the things of this life do not
flow in to them abundantly, and are in short supply.

<span id="iv.iii.xvi-p8"></span>“Not that I speak in respect of want.” I
said, saith he, “now at length,” and I rebuked you, not seeking mine
own, nor censuring you on this account, as if I were in want: for I
sought it not on this account. Whence is this, O Paul, that thou makest
no vain boasting? To the Corinthians he saith, “For we write none other
things unto you, than what ye read or even acknowledge.” ([2 Cor. i.
13](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#013)<span id="iv.iii.xvi-p8.1"></span>..md)
And in this case he would not have spoken to them so as to be convicted,
he would not, had he been making boasts, have spoken thus. He was
speaking to those who knew the facts, with whom detection would have
been a greater disgrace. “For I have learnt,” saith he, “in whatsoever
state I am, therein to be content.” Wherefore, this is an object of
discipline, and exercise, and care, for it is not easy of attainment,
but very difficult, and a new thing. “In whatsoever state I am,” saith
he, “therein to be content. I know how to be abased, and I know also how
to abound. In everything and in all things have I learned the secret.”
That is, I know how to use little, to bear hunger and want. “Both to
abound, and to suffer need.” “But, says one, there is no need of wisdom
or of virtue in order to abound.” There is great need of virtue, not
less than in the other case. For as want inclines us to do many evil
things, so too doth plenty. For many ofttimes, coming into plenty, have
become indolent, and have not known how to bear their good fortune. Many
men have taken it as an occasion of no longer working. But Paul did not
so, for what he received he consumed on others, and emptied himself for
them. This is to know. He was in nowise relaxed, nor did he exult at his
abundance; but was the same in want and in plenty, he was neither
oppressed on the one hand, nor rendered a boaster on the other. “Both to
be filled,” saith he, “and to be hungry, both to abound, and to be in
want.” Many know not how to be full, as for example, the Israelites,
“ate, and kicked” ([Deut. xxxii.
15](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#015.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xvi-p8.2"></span>.), but I am equally well ordered in all. He
showeth that he neither is now elated, nor was before grieved: or if he
grieved, it was on their account, not on his own, for he himself was
similarly affected.

<span id="iv.iii.xvi-p9"></span>“In everything,” saith he, “and in all
things I have learned the secret,” i.e. I have had experience of all
things in this long time, and these things have all succeeded with me.
But since boasting might seem to have a place here, see how quickly he
checks up, and says, “I can do all things in Christ <span
id="fr_677"></span>[678](#fn_677.md) that strengtheneth me.” The success is
not mine own, but His who has given me strength. But since they who
confer benefits, when they see the receiver not well affected toward
them, but despising the gifts, are themselves rendered more remiss, (for
they considered themselves as conferring a benefit and refreshment,) if
therefore Paul despises the refreshment, they must necessarily become
remiss, in order then that this may not happen, see how he healeth it
again. By what he hath said above, he hath brought down their proud
thoughts, by what followeth he maketh their readiness revive, by saying,
“Howbeit ye did well, that ye had fellowship with my affliction.” Seest
thou, how he removed himself, and again united himself to them. This is
the part of true and spiritual friendship. Think not, saith he, because
I was not in want, that I had no need of this act of yours. I have need
of it for your sake. How then, did they share his afflictions? By this
means. As he said when in bonds, “Ye all are partakers with me of
grace.” ([Philip. i. 7](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#007.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xvi-p10.1"></span>.) For it is grace to suffer for Christ, as
he himself saith in another place, “For to you it is given from God not
only to believe on Him, but also to suffer for Him.” ([Philip. i.
29](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#029.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xvi-p10.2"></span>.) For since those former words by
themselves might have made them regardless, <span id="page_251">p.
251</span> <span id="iv.iii.xvi-Page_251"></span>for this cause he
consoleth them, and receiveth them, and praiseth them again. And this in
measured words. For he said not, “gave,” but “had fellowship,” to show
that they too were profited by becoming partakers of his labors. He said
not, ye did lighten, but ye did communicate with my affliction, which
was something more elevated. Seest thou the humility of Paul? seest thou
his noble nature? When he has shown that he had no need of their gifts
on his own account, he afterward uses freely such lowly words as they do
who make a request; “since thou art wont to give.” For he refuseth
neither to do, nor say anything. That is, “Think not that my words show
want of shame, wherein I accuse you, and say, ‘Now at length ye have
revived,’ or are those of one in necessity; I speak not thus because I
am in need, but why? From my exceeding confidence in you, and of this
also ye yourselves are the authors.”

<span id="iv.iii.xvi-p11"></span>Seest thou how he sootheth them? How
are ye the authors? In that ye hasted to the work before all the others;
and have given me confidence to remind you of these things. And observe
his elevation; he accuseth them not while they did not send, lest he
should seem to regard his own benefit, but when they had sent, then he
rebuked them for the time past, and they received it, for he could not
seem after that to regard his own benefit.

<span id="iv.iii.xvi-p12"></span>[Philip.
4.15](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#015.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xvi-p12.1"></span>. “Ye yourselves also know, ye Philippians,
that in the beginning of the Gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no
Church had communicated with me, as concerning giving and receiving, but
ye only.”

<span id="iv.iii.xvi-p13"></span>Lo, how great is his commendation! For
the Corinthians and Romans are stirred up by hearing these things from
him, whilst the Philippians did it without any other Church having made
a beginning. For “in the beginning of the Gospel,” saith he, they
manifested such zeal towards the holy Apostle, as themselves first to
begin, without having any example, to bear this fruit. And no one can
say that they did these things because he abode with them, or for their
own benefit; for he saith, “When I departed from Macedonia, no Church
had fellowship with me, in the matter of giving and receiving, but ye
only.” What meaneth “receiving,” and what “had fellowship”? Wherefore
said he not, “no Church gave to me,” but “had fellowship with me, in the
matter of giving and receiving”? Because it is a case of communication.
He saith, “If we sowed unto you spiritual things, is it a great matter
if we shall reap your carnal things.” ([1 Cor. ix.
11](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#011.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xvi-p13.1"></span>.) And again, “That your abundance may be a
supply to their want.” ([2 Cor. viii.
14](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#014.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xvi-p13.2"></span>.) How did they communicate? In the matter
of giving carnal things, and receiving spiritual. For as they who sell
and buy communicate with each other, by mutually giving what they have,
(and this is communication,) so too is it here. For there is not
anything more profitable than this trade and traffic. It is performed on
the earth, but is completed in heaven. They who buy are on the earth,
but they buy and agree about heavenly things, whilst they lay down an
earthly price.

<span id="iv.iii.xvi-p14"></span>But despond not; heavenly things are
not to be bought with money, riches cannot purchase these things, but
the purpose of him who giveth the money, his true wisdom, his
superiority to earthly things, his love toward man, his mercifulness.
For if money could purchase it, she who threw in the two mites would
have gained nothing great. But since it was not the money, but the
purpose that availed, she received everything, who exhibited a full
purpose of mind. Let us not then say, that the Kingdom can be bought
with money; it is not by money, but by purpose of mind which is
exhibited by the money. Therefore, will one answer, there is no need of
money? There is no need of money, but of the disposition; if thou hast
this, thou wilt be able even by two mites to purchase Heaven; where this
is not, not even ten thousand talents of gold will be able to do that,
which the two mites could. Wherefore? Because if thou who hast much
throwest in but a small portion, thou gavest an alms indeed, but not so
great as the widow did; for thou didst not throw it in with the same
readiness as she. For she deprived herself of all she had, or rather she
deprived not, but gave it all as a free gift to herself. Not for a cup
of cold water hath God promised the kingdom, but for readiness of heart;
not for death, but for purpose of mind. For indeed it is no great thing.
For what is it to give one life? that is giving one man; but one man is
not of worth enough.

<span id="iv.iii.xvi-p15"></span>[Philip.
4.16](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#016.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xvi-p15.1"></span>. “For even in Thessalonica, ye sent once
and again unto my need.”

<span id="iv.iii.xvi-p16"></span>Here again is great praise, that he,
when dwelling in the metropolis, <span id="fr_678"></span>[679](#fn_678.md)
should be nourished by a little city. And lest, by always withdrawing
himself from the supposition of want, he should, as I said at first,
render them amiss, having previously shown by so many proofs that he is
not in want, he here does it by one word only, by saying “needs.” And he
said not “my,” <span id="fr_679"></span>[680](#fn_679.md) but
absolutely,—having a care of dignity. And not this only, but what
followeth too, for since he was conscious that it was a very lowly
thing, he again secures it, by adding as a correction,

<span id="iv.iii.xvi-p19"></span>[Philip.
4.17](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#017.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xvi-p19.1"></span>. “Not that I seek for the gift.”

<span id="iv.iii.xvi-p20"></span>As he said above, “Not that I speak in
re<span id="page_252">p. 252</span> <span
id="iv.iii.xvi-Page_252"></span>spect of want”; that is stronger than
this. For it is one thing, that he who is in want, should not seek, and
another that he who is in want should not even consider himself to be in
want. “Not that I seek for the gift,” he says, “but I seek for the
fruit, that increaseth to your account.” Not mine own. Seest thou, that
the fruit is produced for them? This say I for your sake, says he, not
for my own, for your salvation. For I gain nothing when I receive, but
the grace belongeth to the givers, for the recompense is yonder in store
for givers, but the gifts are here consumed by them who receive. Again
even his desire is combined with praise and sympathy.

<span id="iv.iii.xvi-p21"></span>When he had said, I do not seek, lest
he should again render them remiss, he adds,

<span id="iv.iii.xvi-p22"></span>[Philip.
4.18](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#018.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xvi-p22.1"></span>. “But I have all things and abound,” i.e.
through this gift ye have filled up what was wanting, which would make
them more eager. For benefactors, the wiser they are, the more do they
seek gratitude from the benefited. That is, ye have not only filled up
what was deficient in former time, but ye have gone beyond. For lest by
these words he should seem to accuse them, see how he seals up all.
After he had said, “Not that I seek for the gift,” and “Now at length”;
and had shown that their deed was a debt, for this is meant by, “I have
all,” then again he showeth, that they had acted above what was due, and
saith, “I have all things and abound, I am filled.” I say not this at
hazard, or only from the feeling of my mind, but why? “Having received
of Epaphroditus the things that came from you, an odor of a sweet smell;
a sacrifice acceptable, well pleasing to God.” Lo, whither he hath
raised their gift; not I, he saith, received, but God through me.
Wherefore though I be not in need, regard it not, for God had no need,
and He received at their hands in such sort, that the Holy Scriptures
shrunk not from saying, “God smelled a sweet savor” ([Gen. viii.
21](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#021.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xvi-p22.2"></span>.), which denotes one who was pleased. For
ye know, indeed ye know, how our soul is affected by sweet savors, how
it is pleased, how it is delighted. The Scriptures therefore shrunk not
from applying to God a word so human, and so lowly, that it might show
to men that their gifts are become acceptable. For not the fat, not the
smoke, made them acceptable, but the purpose of mind which offered them.
Had it been otherwise, Cain’s offering too had been received. It saith
then, that He is even pleased, and how He is pleased. For men could not
without this have learned. He then, who hath no need, saith that He is
thus pleased, that they may not become remiss by the absence of need.
And afterward, when they had no care for other virtues, and trusted to
their offerings alone, behold, how again he setteth them right by
saying, “Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?”
([Ps. l. 13](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#013.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xvi-p22.3"></span>.) This Paul also saith. “Not that I seek,”
saith he, “for the gift.”

<span id="iv.iii.xvi-p23"></span>[Philip.
4.19](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#019.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xvi-p23.1"></span>. “And may <span
id="fr_680"></span>[681](#fn_680.md) my God fulfill every need of yours,
according to His riches in glory, in Christ Jesus.”

<span id="iv.iii.xvi-p25"></span>Behold how he invokes blessings upon
them, as poor men do. But if even Paul blesseth those who give, much
more let us not be ashamed to do this when we receive. Let us not
receive as though we ourselves had need, let us not rejoice on our own
account, but on that of the givers. Thus we too who receive shall have a
reward, if we rejoice for their sake. Thus we shall not take it hardly,
when men do not give, but rather shall grieve for their sake. So shall
we render them more zealous, if we teach them, that not for our own sake
do we so act; “but may my God” fulfill every need of yours, or every
grace, or every joy. <span id="fr_681"></span>[682](#fn_681.md) If the
second be true, “every grace,” he meaneth not only the alms, which are
of earth, but every excellency. If the first, “your every need,” which I
think too should rather be read, this is what he means to show. As he
had said, “ye lacked opportunity,” he here maketh an addition, as he
doth in the Epistle to the Corinthians, saying, “And He that supplieth
seed to the sower, may He supply bread for food, and multiply your seed
for sowing, and increase the fruits of your righteousness.” ([2 Cor. ix.
10](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#010.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xvi-p26.1"></span>.) He invokes blessings upon them, that
they may abound, and have wherewith to sow. He blesseth them too, not
simply that they might abound, but “according to His riches,” so that
this too is done in measured terms. For had they been as he was, so
truly wise, so crucified, he would not have done this; but since they
were men that were handicraftsmen, poor, having wives, bringing up
children, ruling their families, and who had given these very gifts out
of small possessions, and had certain desires of the things of this
world, he blesseth them appropriately. For it is not unseemly to invoke
sufficiency and plenty upon those who thus use them. See too what he
said. He said not, May He make you rich, and to abound greatly; but what
said he? “May He fulfill every need of yours,” so that ye may not be in
want, but have things for your necessities. Since Christ too, when He
gave us a form of prayer, inserted also this in the prayer, when He
taught us to say,

<span id="iv.iii.xvi-p27"></span>“Give us this day our daily bread.”
([Matt. vi. 11](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#011.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xvi-p27.1"></span>.)

<span id="iv.iii.xvi-p28"></span>“According to His riches.” That is,
accord<span id="page_253">p. 253</span> <span
id="iv.iii.xvi-Page_253"></span>ing to His free gift, i.e. it is easy to
Him, and possible, and quickly. And since I have spoken of need, do not
think that he will drive you into straits. Wherefore he added,
“according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.” So shall all things
abound to you, that you may have them to His glory. Or, ye are wanting
in nothing; (for it is written, “great grace was upon them all, neither
was there any that lacked.”) ([Acts iv.
33](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#033.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xvi-p28.1"></span>.) Or, so as to do all things for His
glory, as if he had said, that ye may use your abundance to His glory.

<span id="iv.iii.xvi-p29"></span>[Philip.
4.20](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#020.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xvi-p29.1"></span>. “Now unto our God and Father be the glory
for ever and ever. Amen.” For the glory of which he speaks belongs not
only to the Son, but to the Father too, for when the Son is glorified,
then is the Father also. For when he said, This is done to the glory of
Christ, lest any one should suppose that it is to His glory alone, he
continued, “Unto our God and Father be the glory,” that glory which is
paid to the Son.

<span id="iv.iii.xvi-p30"></span>[Philip.
4.21](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#021.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xvi-p30.1"></span>. “Salute every saint in Christ Jesus.”
This also is no small thing. For it is a proof of great good will, to
salute them through letters. “The brethren which are with me salute
you.” And yet thou saidst that thou hast “no one like-minded, who will
care truly for your state.” How then sayest thou now, “The brethren
which are with me”? He either saith, “The brethren which are with me,”
because he hath no one like-minded of those who are with him, (where he
doth not speak of those in the city, for how were they constrained to
undertake the affairs of the Apostles?) or that he did not refuse to
call even those brethren.

<span id="iv.iii.xvi-p31"></span>[Phil.
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#022.md),
[23](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#023.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xvi-p31.1"></span>. “All the saints salute you, especially
they that are of Cæsar’s household. The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ
be with your spirit.”

<span id="iv.iii.xvi-p32"></span>He elevated them and strengthened them,
by showing that his preaching had reached even to the king’s <span
id="fr_682"></span>[683](#fn_682.md) household. For if those who were in
the king’s palace despised all things for the sake of the King of
Heaven, far more ought they to do this. And this too was a proof of the
love of Paul, and that he had told many things of them, and said great
things of them, whence he had even led those who were in the palace to a
longing for them, so that those who had never seen them saluted them.
Especially because the faithful were then in affliction, his love was
great. And those who were absent from each other were closely conjoined
together as if real limbs. And the poor man was similarly disposed
toward the rich, and the rich toward the poor, and there was no
preëminence, in that they were all equally hated and cast out, and that
for the same cause. For as, if captives taken from divers cities should
arise and come to the same towns, they eagerly embrace each other, their
common calamity binding them together; thus too at that time they had
great love one toward another, the communion of their afflictions and
persecutions uniting them.

<span id="iv.iii.xvi-p34"></span><span class="c13"><span
id="iv.iii.xvi-p34.1"></span>Moral.</span> For affliction is an unbroken
bond, the increase of love, the occasion of compunction and piety. Hear
the words of David, “It is good for me that I have been afflicted, that
I might learn Thy statutes.” ([Ps. cxix.
71](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#071.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xvi-p34.2"></span>.) And again another prophet, who saith,
“It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth.” ([Lam. iii.
27](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#027.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xvi-p34.3"></span>.) And again, “Blessed is the man whom Thou
chastenest, O Lord.” ([Ps. xciv.
12](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#012.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xvi-p34.4"></span>.) And another who saith, “Despise not the
chastening of the Lord.” ([Prov. iii.
11](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#011.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xvi-p34.5"></span>.) And “if thou come near to serve the
Lord, prepare thy soul for temptation.” ([Ecclesiasticus
11.1](../../../bib/apo/sir011.htm#001.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xvi-p34.6"></span>.) And Christ also said to His disciples,
“In the world ye shall have tribulation, but be of good cheer.” ([John
xvi. 33](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#033.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xvi-p34.7"></span>.) And again, “Ye shall weep and lament,
but the world shall rejoice.” ([John. xvi.
20](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#020.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xvi-p34.8"></span>.) And again, “Narrow and straitened is the
way.” ([Matt. vii. 14](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#014.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xvi-p34.9"></span>.) Dost thou see how tribulation is
everywhere lauded, everywhere assumed as needful for us? For if in the
contests of the world, no one without this receiveth the crown, unless
he fortify himself by toil, by abstinence from delicacies, by living
according to rule, by watchings, and innumerable other things, much more
so here. For whom wilt thou name as an instance? The king? Not even he
liveth a life free from care, but one burdened with much tribulation and
anxiety. For look not to his diadem, but to his sea of cares, by which
the crown is produced for him. Nor look to his purple robe, but to his
soul, which is darker than that purple. His crown doth not so closely
bind his brow, as care doth his soul. Nor look to the multitude of his
spearmen, but to the multitude of his disquietudes. For it is not
possible to find a private house laden with so many cares as a king’s
palace. Violent deaths are each day expected, and a vision of blood is
seen as they sit down to eat and drink. Nor can we say how oft he is
disturbed in the night season, and leaps up, haunted with visions. And
all this in peace; but if war should overtake him, what could be more
piteous than such a life as this! What evils has he from those that are
his own, I mean, those who are under his dominion. Nay, and of a truth
the pavement of a king’s house is always full of blood, the blood of his
own relations. And if ye will, I will also relate some instances, and ye
will presently know; chiefly old occurrences—but also some things that
have happened in our own times—yet still preserved <span
id="page_254">p. 254</span> <span id="iv.iii.xvi-Page_254"></span>in
memory. One, <span id="fr_683"></span>[684](#fn_683.md) it is said, having
suspected his wife of adultery, bound her naked upon mules, and exposed
her to wild beasts, though she had already been the mother to him of
many princes. What sort of life, think ye, could that man have lived?
For he would not have broken out into such vengeance, had he not been
deeply affected with that distress. Moreover, this same man slew his own
son, <span id="fr_684"></span>[685](#fn_684.md) or rather his brother did
so. Of his sons, the one indeed slew himself when seized by a
tyrant, <span id="fr_685"></span>[686](#fn_685.md) and another put to death
his cousin, his colleague in the kingdom, to which he had appointed him;
and <span id="fr_686"></span>[687](#fn_686.md) saw his wife destroyed by
pessaries, for when she bore not, a certain wretched and miserable woman
(for such indeed she was who thought to supply the gift of God by her
own wisdom) gave her pessaries, and destroyed the queen, and herself
perished with her. And this man is said to have also killed his own
brother. <span id="fr_687"></span>[688](#fn_687.md) Another again, his
successor, was destroyed by noxious drugs, and his cup was to him no
longer drink, but death. And his son had an eye put out, from fear of
what was to follow, though he had done no wrong. It is not befitting to
mention how another ended his life miserably. And after them, one was
burnt, like some miserable wretch, amongst horses, and beams, and all
sorts of things, and left his wife in widowhood. For it is not possible
to relate the woes which he was compelled to undergo in his lifetime,
when he rose up in revolt. And hath not he who now rules, from the time
he received the crown, been in toil, in danger, in grief, in dejection,
in misfortune, exposed to conspiracies? Such is not the kingdom of
heaven, but after it is received, there is peace, life, joy, delight.
But as I said, life cannot be without pain. For if in the affairs of
this world even he who is accounted most happy, if the king is burdened
with so many misfortunes, what thinkest thou must be true of private
life? I cannot say how many other evils there are! How many stories have
ofttimes been woven on these subjects! For nearly all the tragedies of
the stage, as well as the mythical stories, have kings for their
subjects. For most of these stories are formed from true incidents, for
it is thus they please. As for example, Thyestes’ banquet, and the
destruction to all that family by their misfortunes.

<span id="iv.iii.xvi-p42"></span>These things we know from the
writers <span id="fr_688"></span>[689](#fn_688.md) that are without: but if
ye will, I will adduce instances from the Scripture too. Saul was the
first king, and ye knew how he perished, after experiencing numberless
ills. After him, David, Solomon, Abia, Hezekiah, Josiah, in like sort.
For it is not possible, without affliction and toil, and without
dejection of mind, to pass through the present life. But let us be cast
down in mind, not for such things as these, for which kings grieve, but
for those things, whence we (thus) have great gain. “For godly sorrow
worketh repentance unto salvation, a repentance which bringeth no
regret.” ([2 Cor. vii. 10](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#010.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xvi-p43.1"></span>.) On account of these things we should be
grieved, for these things we should be pained, for these things we
should be pricked at heart; thus was Paul grieved for sinners, thus did
he weep. “For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto
you in many tears.” ([2 Cor. ii.
4](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#004)<span id="iv.iii.xvi-p43.2"></span>..md)
For when he had no cause of grief on his own account, he did so on
account of others, or rather he accounted those things too to be his
own, at least as far as grief went. Others were offended, and he burned;
others were weak, and he was weak: such grief as this is good, is
superior to all worldly joy. Him who so grieves I prefer to all men, or
rather the Lord Himself pronounces them blessed, who so grieve, who are
sympathizing. I do not so much admire him in dangers, or rather I do not
admire him less for the dangers by which he died daily, yet this still
more captivates me. For it came of a soul <span id="page_255">p.
255</span> <span id="iv.iii.xvi-Page_255"></span>devoted to God, and
full of affection: from the love which Christ Himself seeketh: from a
brotherly and a fatherly sympathy, or rather, of one greater than both
these. Thus we should be affected, thus weep; such tears as these are
full of great delight; such grief as this is the ground of joy.

<span id="iv.iii.xvi-p44"></span>And say not to me: What do they for
whom I grieve gain by my so doing? Though we no way profit them for whom
we grieve, at all events we shall profit ourselves. For he who grieveth
thus on account of others, much more will so do for himself; he who thus
weepeth for the sins of others will not pass by his own transgressions
unwept, or rather, he will not quickly sin. But this is dreadful, that
when we are ordered so to grieve for them that sin, we do not even
exhibit any repentance for our own sins, but when sinning remain without
feeling, and have care for and take account of anything, rather than our
own sins. For this cause we rejoice with a worthless joy, which is the
joy of the world, and straightway quenched, and which brings forth
griefs innumerable. Let us then grieve with grief which is the mother of
joy, and let us not rejoice with joy which brings forth grief. Let us
shed tears which are the seeds of great joy, and not laugh with that
laughter, which brings forth the gnashing of teeth for us. Let us be
afflicted with affliction, from which springs up ease, and let us not
seek luxury, whence great affliction and pain is born. Let us labor a
little time upon the earth, that we may have continual enjoyment in
heaven. Let us afflict ourselves in this transitory life, that we may
attain rest in that which is endless. Let us not be remiss in this short
life, lest we groan in that which is endless.

<span id="iv.iii.xvi-p45"></span>See ye not how many are here in
affliction for the sake of worldly things? Consider that thou also art
one of them, and bear thy affliction and thy pain, feeding on the hope
of things to come. Thou art not better than Paul or Peter, who never
obtained rest, who passed all their life in hunger and thirst and
nakedness. If thou wouldest attain the same things with them, why
journeyest thou along a contrary road? If thou wouldest arrive at that
City, of which they have been deemed worthy, walk along the path which
leadeth thither. The way of ease leadeth not thither, but that of
affliction. The former is broad, the latter is narrow; along this let us
walk, that we may attain eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord, with
whom, to the Father, together with the Holy Ghost, be honor, might,
power, now and ever, and world without end. Amen.

<span id="iv.iii.xvi-p24"></span> \[This is the reading for the N.T.

read, “And my God shall fulfill,” as do also several documents for

<span id="fn_681"></span>[252:682](1130057.htm#fr_681.md) <span
id="iv.iii.xvi-p25.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.xvi-p26"></span> \[The words χρείαν, “need,” χάριν,
“grace,” and χαρὰν, “joy,” are similar, and Chrys. indulges in some
conjectures. Tisch. gives no evidence of any question as to the
reading.—J.A.B.\]

<span id="fn_682"></span>[253:683](1130057.htm#fr_682.md) <span
id="iv.iii.xvi-p32.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.xvi-p33"></span> \[It must be remembered that “king”
was the regular Greek term for the Roman imperator (emperor).—J.A.B.\]

<span id="fn_683"></span>[254:684](1130057.htm#fr_683.md) <span
id="iv.iii.xvi-p34.10"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.xvi-p35"></span> After these words the Greek text is
disarranged, and irreconcilable with itself and with the real history.
Chrysostom seems, however, to intend to say what follows; that the
brother of Crispus, i.e. Constantius Augustus, caused his father’s
brother, Julius Constantius, and his sons, Dalmatius and Annibalianus,
to be put to death. They were in fact slain by the soldiery, and as some
thought, at the instigation of Constantius Augustus, son of Constantine.
He adds afterwards, that his brother was taken by an usurper, and killed
himself. Now Constans Augustus, the brother of Constantius, was taken by
the usurper Magnentius, or rather by his generals, and slain, but no
writer except Chrysostom says that he killed himself. He adds that
Constantius slew his cousin. This was Gallus, who was made his colleague
in the Empire by Constantius, and put to death by his order, A.D.
345.—*Montf*.

<span id="iv.iii.xvi-p36"></span>(Tillemont understands this otherwise,
and more according to the Greek which is not difficult to construe as it
stands; viz. that *Constans* killed himself and his children \[if he had
any, which does not otherwise appear\] when taken by Magnentius, and
that he \[*Constans*\] caused the death of his brother Constantine the
younger.)

<span id="fn_684"></span>[254:685](1130057.htm#fr_684.md) <span
id="iv.iii.xvi-p36.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.xvi-p37"></span> Here Chrysostom relates the violent
deaths that had occurred within memory in the imperial palace; he goes,
however, by common report, which usually varies from the real fact. He
mentions the events without the names. There is no doubt, however, that
the first example brought forward is Constantine the Great, who caused
his son Crispus to be put to death, and afterwards his wife Fausta.
Chrysostom says he exposed her to wild beasts; others, however, relate
that she was suffocated by his order in a hot bath. Tillemont gives the
most accurate of all the accounts of this affair.—*Montf*.

<span id="fn_685"></span>[254:686](1130057.htm#fr_685.md) <span
id="iv.iii.xvi-p37.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.xvi-p38"></span> \[There is no known warrant for
translating τύραννος by “rebel,” as the Oxford tr. does. It probably
means some local usurping despot. In the Hom. on the return of Bishop
Flavian, Chrysostom makes the emperor speak of the Antiochene mob who
insulted his statues as “tyrants,” just as we say, “the tyranny of a
mob.”—J.A.B.\]

<span id="fn_686"></span>[254:687](1130057.htm#fr_686.md) <span
id="iv.iii.xvi-p38.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.xvi-p39"></span> As for what Chrysostom adds (as usual,
without names) of the wife of one of the Augusti who used drugs to cure
barrenness, and perished together with the woman who supplied the drugs,
also of another Augustus who was poisoned, and whose son had an eye put
out, and another who perished in some horrible manner, I have not yet
been able to find out to whom it applies. But what follows, of one burnt
among beams and horses and all sorts of things, relates to Valens, who
after his defeat at Hadrianople retired to a house, and was burnt to
ashes with it. The reigning emperor was Arcadius, with respect to whom
the history of that age attests the truth of his words.—*Montf*.

<span id="iv.iii.xvi-p40"></span>Tillemont understands the one poisoned
to be Jovian, and says that his son Varronianus was treated as here
mentioned, and afterwards put to death; and so Montf., in his
Introduction to St. Chrys., “ad Viduam Juniorem,” t.i.p. 337.

<span id="fn_687"></span>[254:688](1130057.htm#fr_687.md) <span
id="iv.iii.xvi-p40.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.xvi-p41"></span> \[The older text, as here given after
Field, may afford some help in these inquiries. The altered text, to
which the notes refer, makes the brother of the first-mentioned king
slay himself and his children. He whose wife was destroyed is there
different from the one just preceding; and he who killed his brother is
there the suicide. These differences are stated for the sake of those
who are curious about such matters.—J.A.B.\]
