id="iv.iv.xii-p1.1"></span>Homily XII.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.xii-p2"></span><span id="iv.iv.xii-p2.1"></span><span
class="c1"><span id="iv.iv.xii-p2.2"></span>[Col.
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#012.md),

<span id="iv.iv.xii-p3"></span>“Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant
of Christ Jesus, saluteth you, always striving for you in his prayers,
that ye may stand perfect and fully assured in all the will of God. For
I bear him witness, that he hath much zeal <span
id="fr_900"></span>[901](#fn_900.md) for you, and for them in Laodicea, and
for them in Hierapolis.”

<span id="iv.iv.xii-p5"></span><span class="c13"><span
id="iv.iv.xii-p5.1"></span>In</span> the commencement of this Epistle
also, he commended this man for his love; for even to praise is a sign
of love; thus in the beginning he said, “Who also declared unto us your
love in the Spirit.” ([Col. i. 8](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#008.md)<span
id="iv.iv.xii-p5.2"></span>.) To pray for one is also a sign of love,
and causeth love again. He commends him moreover in order to open a door
to his teachings, for reverendness in the teacher is the disciples’
advantage; and so again is his saying, <span
id="fr_901"></span>[902](#fn_901.md) “one of you,” in order that they might
pride themselves upon the man, as producing such men. And he saith,
“always striving for you in prayers.” He said not simply “praying,” but
“striving,” trembling and fearing. “For I bear him witness,” he saith,
“that he hath much zeal for you.” A trustworthy witness. “That he hath,”
he saith, “much zeal for you,” that is, that he loveth you exceedingly;
and burneth with passionate affection for you. “And them in Laodicea,
and them in Hierapolis.” He commendeth him to those also. But whence
were they to know this? They would assuredly have heard; however, they
would also learn it when the Epistle was read. For he said, “Cause that
it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans.” “That ye may stand
perfect,” he saith. At once he both accuseth them, and without
offensiveness gives them advice and counsel. For it is possible both to
be perfect, and withal not to stand, as if one were to know all, and
still be wavering; it is possible also not to be perfect, and yet to
stand, as if one were to know a part, and stand \[not <span
id="fr_902"></span>[903](#fn_902.md) \] firmly. But this man prayeth for
both: “That ye may stand perfect,” he saith. See how again he has
reminded them of what he said about the Angels, and about life. “And
fully assured,” he saith, “in all the will of God.” It is not enough,
simply to do His will. He that is “filled,” suffereth not any other will
to be within him, for if so, he is not wholly filled. “For I bear him
witness,” he saith, “that he hath much zeal.” Both “zeal,” and “great”;
both are intensitive. As he saith himself, when writing to the
Corinthians, “For I am jealous <span id="fr_903"></span>[904](#fn_903.md)
over you with a godly jealousy.” ([2 Cor. xi.
2](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#002)<span id="iv.iv.xii-p8.1"></span>..md)

<span id="iv.iv.xii-p9"></span>[Col.
4.14](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#014.md)<span id="iv.iv.xii-p9.1"></span>.
“Luke, the beloved physician, saluteth you.” This is the Evangelist. It
is not to lower this man that he placeth him after, but to raise the
other, viz. Epaphroditus. It is probable that there were others called
by this name. <span id="fr_904"></span>[905](#fn_904.md) “And Demas,” he
says. After saying, “Luke, the physician, saluteth you,” he added, “the
beloved.” And no small praise is this, but even great exceedingly, to be
beloved of Paul.

<span id="iv.iv.xii-p11"></span>[Col.
4.15](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#015.md)<span
id="iv.iv.xii-p11.1"></span>. “Salute the brethren that are in Laodicea,
and Nymphas, and the Church that is in their house.”

<span id="iv.iv.xii-p12"></span>See how he cements, and knits them
together with one another, not by salutation only, but also by
interchanging his Epistles. Then again he pays a compliment by
addressing him individually. And this he doth not without a reason, but
in order to lead the others also to emulate his zeal. For it is not a
small thing not to be numbered with the rest. Mark further how he shows
the man to be great, seeing his house was a church.

<span id="iv.iv.xii-p13"></span>[Col.
4.14](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#014.md)<span
id="iv.iv.xii-p13.1"></span>. “And when this Epistle hath been read
among you, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans.”
I suppose there are some of the things therein written, which it was
needful that those also should hear. And they would have the greater
advantage of recognizing their own errors in the charges brought against
others.

<span id="iv.iv.xii-p14"></span>“And that ye also read the Epistle from
Laodicea.” Some say that this is not Paul’s to them, but theirs to Paul,
for he said not that to the Laodiceans, but that written “from
Laodicea.”

<span id="iv.iv.xii-p15"></span>[Col.
4.17](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#017.md)<span
id="iv.iv.xii-p15.1"></span>. “And say to Archippus, Take heed to the
ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfill it.”
Wherefore doth he not write to him? Perhaps he needed it not, but only a
bare reminding, so as to be more diligent.

<span id="iv.iv.xii-p16"></span>[Col.
4.18](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#018.md)<span
id="iv.iv.xii-p16.1"></span>. “The salutation of me, Paul, with mine own
hand.” This is a proof of their sincerity and affection; that they both
looked at his handwriting, and that with emotion. “Remember my bonds.”
Wonderful! How great the consolation! For this is enough to cheer them
on to all things, and make them bear them<span id="page_315">p.
315</span> <span id="iv.iv.xii-Page_315"></span>selves more nobly in
their trials; but he made them not only the braver, but also the more
nearly interested. “Grace be with you. Amen.”

<span id="iv.iv.xii-p17"></span>It is great praise, and greater than all
the rest, his saying of Epaphras, “who is \[one\] of you, a servant of
Christ.” <span id="fr_905"></span>[906](#fn_905.md) And he calleth him a
minister for them, like as he termeth himself also a minister of the
Church, as when he saith, “Whereof I Paul was made a minister.” ([Col.
i. 23](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#023.md)<span
id="iv.iv.xii-p18.1"></span>.) To the same dignity he advances this man;
and above he calleth him a “fellow-servant” ([Col. i.
7](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#007)<span id="iv.iv.xii-p18.2"></span>..md),
and here, “a servant.” “Who is of you,” he saith, as if speaking to a
mother, and saying, “who is of thy womb.” But this praise might have
gendered envy; therefore he commendeth him not from these things only,
but also from what had regard to themselves; and so he does away with
envy, both in the former place, and here. “Always,” he saith, “striving
for you,” not now only, whilst with us, to make a display; nor yet only
whilst with you, to make a display before you. By saying, “striving,” he
hath showed his great earnestness. Then, that he might not seem to be
flattering them, he added, “that he hath much zeal for you, and for them
in Laodicea, and for them in Hierapolis.” And the words, “that ye may
stand perfect,” are not words of flattery, but of a reverend teacher.
Both “fully assured” he saith, “and perfect.” The one he granted them,
the other he said was lacking. And he said not, “that ye be not shaken,”
but, “that ye may stand.” Their being saluted, however, by many, is
refreshing to them, seeing that not only their friends from among
themselves; but others also, remember them.

<span id="iv.iv.xii-p19"></span>“And say to Archippus, Take heed to the
ministry which thou hast received in the Lord.” His chief aim is to
subject them to him <span id="fr_906"></span>[907](#fn_906.md) entirely.
For they could no more have complaint against him for rebuking them,
when they themselves had taken it all upon them; for it is not
reasonable to talk to the disciples about the teacher. But to stop their
mouths, he writes thus to them; “Say to Archippus,” he saith, “Take
heed.” This word is everywhere used to alarm; as when he saith, “Take
heed of dogs.” ([Philip. iii. 2](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#002.md)<span
id="iv.iv.xii-p20.1"></span>.) “Take heed lest there shall be any one
that maketh spoil of you.” ([Col. ii.
8](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#008)<span id="iv.iv.xii-p20.2"></span>..md)
“Take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a
stumblingblock to the weak.” ([1 Cor. viii.
9](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#009)<span id="iv.iv.xii-p20.3"></span>..md)
And he always so expresses himself when he would terrify. “Take heed,”
he saith, “to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that
thou fulfill it.” He doth not even allow him the power of choosing, as
he saith himself, “For if I do this of mine own will, I have a reward:
but if not of mine own will, I have a stewardship entrusted to me.” ([1
Cor. ix. 17](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#017.md)<span
id="iv.iv.xii-p20.4"></span>.) “That thou fulfill it,” continually using
diligence. “Which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfill it.”
Again, the word “in” means “through the Lord.” He gave it thee, says he,
not we. He subjects them also to him, <span
id="fr_907"></span>[908](#fn_907.md) when he shows that they had been
committed to his hands by God.

<span id="iv.iv.xii-p22"></span>“Remember my bonds. Grace be with you.
Amen.” He hath released their terror. For although their teacher be in
bonds, yet “grace” releaseth him. This too is of grace, the granting him
to be put in bonds. For hear Luke saying, The Apostles returned “from
the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to
suffer dishonor for the Name.” ([Acts v.
41](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#041)<span id="iv.iv.xii-p22.1"></span>..md)
For both to suffer shame, and to be put in bonds, is indeed to be
“counted worthy.” For, if he that hath one whom he loveth, deemeth it
gain to suffer aught for his sake, much rather then is it so to suffer
for the sake of Christ. Repine we not then at our tribulations for
Christ’s sake, but let us also remember Paul’s bonds, and be this our
incitement. For instance: dost thou exhort any to give to the poor for
Christ’s sake? Remind them of Paul’s bonds, and bemoan thy misery and
theirs, seeing that he indeed gave up even his body to bonds for His
sake, but thou wilt not give a portion even of thy food. Art thou lifted
up because of thy good deeds? Remember Paul’s bonds, that thou hast
suffered nought of that kind, and thou wilt be lifted up no more.
Covetest thou any of the things that are thy neighbor’s? Remember Paul’s
bonds, and thou wilt see how unreasonable it is, that whilst he was in
perils, thou shouldest be in delights. Again, is thine heart set upon
self-indulgence? Picture to thy mind Paul’s prison-house; thou art his
disciple, his fellow-soldier. How is it reasonable, that thy
fellow-soldier should be in bonds, and thou in luxury? Art thou in
affliction? Dost thou deem thyself forsaken? Hear Paul’s bonds, <span
id="fr_908"></span>[909](#fn_908.md) and thou wilt see, that to be in
affliction is no proof of being forsaken. Wouldest thou wear silken
robes? Remember Paul’s bonds; and these things will appear to thee more
worthless than the filth-bespattered rags of her that sitteth
apart. <span id="fr_909"></span>[910](#fn_909.md) Wouldest thou array thee
with golden trinkets? Picture to thy mind Paul’s bonds, and these things
will seem to thee no better than a withered bulrush. Wouldest thou tire
thine hair, and be beautiful to see? Think <span id="page_316">p.
316</span> <span id="iv.iv.xii-Page_316"></span>of Paul’s squalidness
within that prison-house, and thou wilt burn for that beauty, and deem
this the extreme of ugliness, and wilt groan bitterly through longing
for those bonds. Wouldest thou daub thee with pastes and pigments, and
such like things? Think of his tears: a three-years space, night and
day, he ceased not to weep. ([Acts xx.
31](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#031)<span id="iv.iv.xii-p24.3"></span>..md)
With this adorning deck thy cheek; these tears do make it bright. I say
not, that thou weep for others, (I wish indeed it could be even so, but
this is too high for thee,) but for thine own sins I advise thee to do
this. Hast thou ordered thy slave to be put in bonds, and wast thou
angry, and exasperated? Remember Paul’s bonds, and thou wilt straightway
stay thine anger; remember that we are of the bound, not the binders, of
the bruised in heart, not the bruisers. Hast thou lost self-control, and
shouted loud in laughter? Think of his lamentations, and thou wilt
groan; such tears will show thee brighter far. Seest thou any persons
rioting and dancing? Remember his tears. What fountain has gushed forth
so great streams as those eyes did tears? “Remember my tears” ([Acts xx.
31](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#031.md)<span
id="iv.iv.xii-p24.4"></span>.), he saith, as here “bonds.” And with
reason he spoke thus to them, when he sent for them from Ephesus to
Miletus. For he was then speaking to teachers. He demands of those
therefore, that they should sympathize <span
id="fr_910"></span>[911](#fn_910.md) also, but of these that they should
only encounter dangers.

<span id="iv.iv.xii-p26"></span>What fountain wilt thou compare to these
tears? That in Paradise, which watereth the whole earth? But thou wilt
have mentioned nothing like it. For this fount of tears watered souls,
not earth. If one were to show us Paul bathed in tears, and groaning,
would not this be better far to see, than countless choirs gayly
crowned? I am not now speaking of you; but, if one, having pulled away
from the theater and the stage some wanton fellow, burning and drunken
with carnal love, were to show him a young virgin in the very flower of
her age, surpassing her fellows, both in other respects, and in her face
more than the rest of her person, having an eye, tender and soft, that
gently resteth, and gently rolleth, moist, mild, calmly smiling, and
arrayed in much modesty and much grace, fringed with dark lashes both
under and over, having an eyeball, so to speak, alive, a forehead
radiant; underneath, again, a cheek shaded to exact redness, lying
smooth as marble, and even; and then any one should show me Paul
weeping; leaving that maiden, I would have eagerly sprung away to the
sight of him; for from his eyes there beamed spiritual beauty. For that
other transporteth the souls of youths, it scorcheth and inflameth them;
but this, on the contrary, subdueth them. This maketh the eyes of the
soul more beauteous, it curbeth the belly: it filleth with the love of
wisdom, with much sympathy: and it is able to soften even a soul of
adamant. With these tears the Church is watered, with these souls are
planted; yea, though there be fire sensible and substantial, yet can
these tears quench it; these tears quench the fiery darts of the wicked
one.

<span id="iv.iv.xii-p27"></span>Remember we then these tears of his, and
we shall laugh to scorn all present things. These tears did Christ
pronounce blessed, saying, “Blessed are they that mourn, and blessed are
they that weep, for they shall laugh.” ([Matt.
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#004.md), [Luke
6:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#021.md)<span
id="iv.iv.xii-p27.1"></span>.) Such tears did Isaiah too, and Jeremiah
weep; and the former said, “Leave me alone, I will weep bitterly” ([Isa.
xxii. 4](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#004.md)<span
id="iv.iv.xii-p27.2"></span>, Sept.): and the latter, “Who will give my
head water, and mine eyes fountains of tears?” ([Jer. ix.
1](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#001)<span id="iv.iv.xii-p27.3"></span>..md);
as though the natural fount were not enough.

<span id="iv.iv.xii-p28"></span>Nothing is sweeter than these tears;
sweeter are they than any laughter. They that mourn, know how great
consolation it possesseth. Let us not think this a thing to be
deprecated, but one to be even exceedingly prayed for; not that others
may sin, but that, when they sin, we may be heart-broken for them.
Remember we these tears, these bonds. Surely too upon those bonds tears
descended; but the death of the perishing, of those that had bound him
in them, suffered him not to taste the pleasure of the bonds. For in
their behalf he grieved, being a disciple of Him that bewept the priests
of the Jews; not because they were going to crucify Him, but because
they were themselves perishing. And He doeth not this Himself alone, but
He thus exhorteth others also, saying, “Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not
for Me.” ([Luke xxiii. 28](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#028.md)<span
id="iv.iv.xii-p28.1"></span>.) These eyes saw Paradise, saw the third
heaven: but I count not them so blessed because of this sight, as
because of those tears, through which they saw Christ. Blessed, indeed,
was that sight; for he himself even glories in it, saying, “Have I not
seen Jesus Christ our Lord?” ([1 Cor. ix.
1](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#001)<span id="iv.iv.xii-p28.2"></span>..md);
but more blessed so to weep.

<span id="iv.iv.xii-p29"></span>In that sight many have been partakers,
and those who have not so been, Christ the rather calls blessed, saying,
“Blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed” ([John xx.
29](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#029.md)<span
id="iv.iv.xii-p29.1"></span>.); but unto this not many have attained.
For if to stay here for Christ’s sake were more needful than to depart
to Him ([Phil. 1:23](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#023.md),
[24](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#024.md)<span
id="iv.iv.xii-p29.2"></span>.), for the sake of the salvation of others;
surely then to groan for others’ sakes, is more needful even than to see
Him. For if for His sake to be in <span id="page_317">p. 317</span>
<span id="iv.iv.xii-Page_317"></span>hell, <span
id="fr_911"></span>[912](#fn_911.md) is rather to be desired, than to be
with Him; and to be separated from Him for His sake more to be desired
than to be with Him, (for this is what he said, “For I could wish that I
myself were anathema from Christ” ([Rom. ix.
3](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#003)<span id="iv.iv.xii-p30.2"></span>..md),
much more is weeping for His sake. “I ceased not,” he saith, “to
admonish everyone with tears.” ([Acts xx.
31](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#031)<span id="iv.iv.xii-p30.3"></span>..md)
Wherefore? Not fearing the dangers; no; but as if one sitting by a sick
man’s side, and not knowing what would be the end, should weep for
affection, fearing lest he should lose his life; so too did he; when he
saw any one diseased, and could not prevail by rebuke, he thenceforward
wept. So did Christ also, that happily they might reverence His tears:
thus, one sinned, He rebuked him; the rebuked spat upon Him, and sprang
aloof; He wept, that haply He might win him even so.

<span id="iv.iv.xii-p31"></span>Remember we these tears: thus let us
bring up our daughters, thus our sons; weeping when we see them in evil.
As many women as wish to be loved, let them remember Paul’s tears, and
groan: as many of you as are counted blest, as many as are in bridal
chambers, as many as are in pleasure, remember these; as many as are in
mourning, exchange tears for tears. He mourned not for the dead; but for
those that were perishing whilst alive. Shall I tell of other tears?
Timothy also wept; for he was this man’s disciple; wherefore also when
writing to him he said, “Remembering thy tears, that I may be filled
with joy.” ([2 Tim. i. 4](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#004.md)<span
id="iv.iv.xii-p31.1"></span>.) Many weep even from pleasure. So it is
also a matter of pleasure, and that of the utmost intensity. So the
tears are not painful: yea, the tears that flow from such sorrow are
even better far than those due to worldly pleasure. Hear the Prophet
saying, “The Lord hath heard the voice of my weeping, he hath heard the
voice of my supplication.” ([Ps. vi.
8](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#008)<span id="iv.iv.xii-p31.2"></span>..md)
For where is the tear not useful? in prayers? in exhortations? We get
them an ill name, by using them not to what they are given us for. When
we entreat a sinning brother, we ought to weep, grieving and groaning;
when we exhort any one, and he giveth us no heed, but goeth on
perishing, we ought to weep. These are the tears of heavenly wisdom.
When however one is in poverty, or bodily disease, or dead, not so; for
these are not things worthy of tears.

<span id="iv.iv.xii-p32"></span>As then we gain an ill name for laughter
also, when we use it out of season; so too do we for tears, by having
recourse to them unseasonably. For the virtue of each thing then
discovers itself when it is brought to its own fitting work, but when to
one that is alien, it doth no longer so. For instance, wine is given for
cheerfulness, not drunkenness, bread for nourishment, sexual intercourse
for the procreation of children. As then these things have gained an ill
name, so also have tears. Be there a law laid down, that they be used in
prayers and exhortations only, and see how desirable a thing they will
become. Nothing doth so wipe out sins, as tears. Tears show even this
bodily countenance beautiful; for they win the spectator to pity, they
make it respected in our eyes. Nothing is sweeter than tearful eyes. For
this is the noblest member we have, and the most beautiful, and the
soul’s own. And therefore we are so bowed therewith, as though we saw
the soul itself lamenting.

<span id="iv.iv.xii-p33"></span>I have not spoken these things without a
reason; but in order that ye may cease your attendance at weddings, at
dancings, at Satanical performances. For see what the devil hath
invented. Since nature itself hath withheld women from the stage, and
the disgraceful things enacted there, he hath introduced into the
women’s apartment the furniture of the theater, I mean, wanton men and
harlots. This pestilence the custom of marriages hath introduced, or
rather, not of marriages, far be it, but of our own silliness. What is
it thou doest, O man? Dost thou not know what thou art at? Thou marriest
a wife for chastity, and procreation of children; what then mean these
harlots? That there may be, one answereth, greater gladness. And yet is
not this rather madness? Thou insultest thy bride, thou insultest the
women that are invited. For if they are delighted with such proceedings,
the thing is an insult. If to see harlots acting indecorously conferreth
any honor, wherefore dost thou not drag thy bride also thither, that she
too may see? It is quite indecent and disgraceful to introduce into
one’s house lewd fellows and dancers, and all that Satanic pomp.

<span id="iv.iv.xii-p34"></span>“Remember,” he saith, “my bonds.”
Marriage is a bond, a bond ordained of God, a harlot is a severing and a
dissolving. It is permitted you to embellish marriage with other things,
such as full tables, and apparel. I do not cut off these things, lest I
should seem to be clownish to an extreme; and yet Rebecca was content
with her veil <span id="fr_912"></span>[913](#fn_912.md) only ([Gen. xxiv.
65](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#065.md)<span
id="iv.iv.xii-p35.1"></span>.); still I do not cut them off. It is
permitted you to embellish and set off marriage with apparel, with the
presence of reverend men and reverend women. Why introducest thou those
mockeries? <span id="fr_913"></span>[914](#fn_913.md) why those monsters?
Tell us what it is thou hearest from them? What? dost thou blush to
tell? Dost thou blush, and yet force them to do it? If it is honorable,
wherefore dost thou not do it thyself as well? but if disgraceful,
wherefore dost thou compel another? <span id="page_318">p. 318</span>
<span id="iv.iv.xii-Page_318"></span>Everything should be full of
chasteness, of gravity, of orderliness; but I see the reverse, people
frisking like camels and mules. For the virgin, her chamber <span
id="fr_914"></span>[915](#fn_914.md) is the only befitting place. “But,”
saith one, “she is poor.” Because she is poor, she ought to be modest
also; let her have her character in the place of a fortune. Has she no
dowry to give with herself? Then why dost thou make her otherwise
contemptible through her life and manners? I praise the custom, that
virgins attend to do honor to their fellow; matrons attend to do honor
to her who is made one of their order. Rightly hath this been ordered.
For these are two companies, one of virgins, the other of the married;
the one are giving her up, the other receiving her. The bride is between
them, neither virgin, nor wife, for she is coming forth from those, and
entering into the fellowship of these. But those harlots, what mean
they? They ought to hide their faces when marriage is celebrated; they
ought to be dug into the earth, (for harlotry is the corruption of
marriage,) but we introduce them at our marriages. And, when ye are
engaged in any work, ye count it ill-omened to speak even a syllable of
what is adverse to it; for instance, when thou sowest, when thou drawest
off the wine from thy vats, thou wouldest not, even if asked, utter a
syllable about vinegar; but here, where the object is chasteness,
introduce ye the vinegar? for such is an harlot. When ye are preparing
sweet ointment, ye suffer nought ill-scented to be near. Marriage is a
sweet ointment. Why then introducest thou the foul stench of the
dunghill into the preparation of thy ointment? What sayest thou? Shall
the virgin dance, and yet feel no shame before her fellow? For she ought
to have more gravity than the other; she hath at least come forth from
the \[nurse’s\] arm, and not from the palæstra. For the virgin ought not
to appear publicly at all at a marriage.

<span id="iv.iv.xii-p38"></span>Seest thou not how in kings’ houses, the
honored are within, about the king, the unhonored without? Do thou too
be within about the bride. But remain in the house in chasteness, expose
not thy virginity. Either company is standing by, the one to show of
what sort she is whom they are giving up, the other in order that they
may guard her. Why disgracest thou the virgin estate? For if thou art
such as this, the same will the bridegroom suspect her to be. If thou
wishest to have men in love with thee, this is the part of saleswomen,
green-grocers, and handicrafts-people. Is not this a shame? To act
unseemly is a shame even though it be a king’s daughter. <span
id="fr_915"></span>[916](#fn_915.md) For doth her poverty stand in the way?
or her course of life? Even if a virgin be a slave, let her abide in
modesty. “For in Christ Jesus there can be neither bond nor free.”
([Gal. iii. 28](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#028.md)<span
id="iv.iv.xii-p39.1"></span>.)

<span id="iv.iv.xii-p40"></span>What? is marriage a theater? It is a
mystery and a type of a mighty thing; and even if thou reverence not it,
reverence that whose type it is. “This mystery,” saith he, “is great,
but I speak in regard of Christ and of the Church.” ([Eph. v.
32](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#032)<span id="iv.iv.xii-p40.1"></span>..md)
It is a type of the Church, and of Christ, and dost thou introduce
harlots at it? If then, saith one, neither virgins dance, nor the
married, who is to dance? No one, for what need is there of dancing? In
the Grecian mysteries there are dancings, but in ours, silence and
decency, modesty, and bashfulness. A great mystery is being celebrated:
forth with the harlots! forth with the profane! How is it a mystery?
They come together, and the two make one. Wherefore is it that at his
entrance indeed, there was no dancing, no cymbals, but great silence,
great stillness; but when they come together, making not a lifeless
image, nor yet the image of anything upon earth, but of God Himself, and
after his likeness, thou introducest so great an uproar, and disturbest
those that are there, <span id="fr_916"></span>[917](#fn_916.md) and
puttest the soul to shame, and confoundest it? They come, about to be
made one body. See again a mystery of love! If the two become not one,
so long as they continue two, they make not many, but when they are come
into oneness, they then make many. What do we learn from this? That
great is the power of union. The wise counsel of God at the beginning
divided the one into two; and being desirous of showing that even after
division it remaineth still one, He suffered not that the one should be
of itself enough for procreation. For he is not one who is not yet
\[united, <span id="fr_917"></span>[918](#fn_917.md) \] but the half of
one; and it is evident from this, that he begetteth no offspring, as was
the case also beforetime. <span id="fr_918"></span>[919](#fn_918.md) Seest
thou the mystery of marriage? He made of one, one; <span
id="fr_919"></span>[920](#fn_919.md) and again, having made these two, one,
He so maketh one, so that now also man is produced of one. For man and
wife are not two men, but one Man. And this may be confirmed from many
sources; for instance, from James, <span
id="fr_920"></span>[921](#fn_920.md) from Mary the Mother of Christ, from
the words, “He made them male and female.” ([Gen. i.
27](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#027)<span id="iv.iv.xii-p45.3"></span>..md)
If he <span id="page_319">p. 319</span> <span
id="iv.iv.xii-Page_319"></span>be the head, and she the body, how are
they two? Therefore the one holdeth the rank of a disciple, the other of
a teacher, the one of a ruler, the other of a subject. Moreover, from
the very fashioning of her body, one may see that they are one, for she
was made from his side, and they are, as it were, two halves.

<span id="iv.iv.xii-p46"></span>For this cause He also calleth her a
help, to show that they are one ([Gen. ii.
18](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#018.md)<span
id="iv.iv.xii-p46.1"></span>.); for this cause He honoreth their
cohabitation beyond both father and mother, to show that they are one.
([Gen. ii. 24](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#024.md)<span
id="iv.iv.xii-p46.2"></span>.) And in like manner a father rejoiceth
both when son and daughter marry, as though the body were hastening to
join a member of its own; and though so great a charge and expenditure
of money is incurred still he cannot bear with indifference to see
her <span id="fr_921"></span>[922](#fn_921.md) unmarried. For as though her
own flesh itself were severed from her, each one separately is imperfect
for the procreation of children, each one is imperfect as regards the
constitution of this present life. Wherefore also the Prophet saith,
“the residue of thy spirit.” ([Mal. ii.
15](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#015.md)<span id="iv.iv.xii-p47.1"></span>,
Sept.) And how become they one flesh? As if thou shouldest take away the
purest part of gold, and mingle it with other gold; so in truth here
also the woman as it were receiving the richest part fused by pleasure,
nourisheth it and cherisheth it, and withal contributing her own share,
restoreth it back a Man. And the child is a sort of bridge, so that the
three become one flesh, the child connecting, on either side, each to
other. For like as two cities, which a river divides throughout, become
one, if a bridge connect them on both sides, so is it in this case; and
yet more, when the very bridge in this case is formed of the substance
of each. As the body and the head are one body; for they are divided by
the neck; but not divided more than connected, for it, lying between
them brings together each with the other. And it is the same as if a
chorus that had been severed should, by taking one part of itself from
this quarter, and the other again from the right, make one; or as these
when come into close rank, and extending hands, become one; for the
hands extended admit not of their being two. Therefore to wit He said
with accuracy of expression, not “they shall be one flesh” but joined
together “into one flesh” ([Gen. 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#002.md),
[24](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#024.md)<span id="iv.iv.xii-p47.2"></span>,
Sept.), namely, that of the child. What then? when there is no child,
will they not be two? Nay, for their coming together hath this effect,
it diffuses and commingles the bodies of both. And as one who hath cast
ointment into oil, hath made the whole one; so in truth is it also here.

<span id="iv.iv.xii-p48"></span>I know that many are ashamed at what is
said, and the cause of this is what I spoke of, your own lasciviousness,
and unchasteness. The fact of marriages being thus performed, thus
depraved, hath gained the thing an ill name: for “marriage is honorable,
and the bed undefiled.” ([Heb. xiii.
4](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#004)<span id="iv.iv.xii-p48.1"></span>..md)
Why art thou ashamed of the honorable, why blushest thou at the
undefiled? This is for heretics, <span id="fr_922"></span>[923](#fn_922.md)
this is for such as introduce harlots thither. For this cause I am
desirous of having it thoroughly purified, so as to bring it back again
to its proper nobleness, so as to stop the mouths of the heretics. The
gift of God is insulted, the root of our generation; for about that root
there is much dung and filth. This then let us cleanse away by our
discourse. Endure then a little while, for he that holdeth filth must
endure the stench. I wish to show you that ye ought not to be ashamed at
these things, but at those which ye do; but thou, passing by all shame
at those, art ashamed at these; surely then thou condemnest God who hath
thus decreed.

<span id="iv.iv.xii-p50"></span>Shall I tell how marriage is also a
mystery of the Church? As Christ came into the Church, and she was made
of him, <span id="fr_923"></span>[924](#fn_923.md) and he united with her
in a spiritual intercourse, “for,” saith one, “I have espoused you to
one husband, a pure virgin.” ([2 Cor. xi.
2](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#002)<span id="iv.iv.xii-p51.2"></span>..md)
And that we are of Him, he saith, of His members, “and of His flesh.”
Thinking then on all these things, let us not cast shame upon so great a
mystery. Marriage is a type of the presence of Christ, and art thou
drunken at it? Tell me; if thou sawest an image of the king, wouldest
thou dishonor it? By no means.

<span id="iv.iv.xii-p52"></span>Now the practices at marriages seem to
be a matter of indifference, but they are the causes of great mischiefs.
All is full of lawlessness. “Filthiness, and foolish talking, and
jesting, let it not proceed,” saith he, “out of your mouth.” ([Eph.
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#004.md), [Eph.
4:29](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#029.md)<span
id="iv.iv.xii-p52.1"></span>.) Now all these things are filthiness,
foolish talking, and jesting; and not these simply, but with
aggravation, for the thing has become an art, and there are great
praises for those that pursue it. Sins have become an art! We pursue
them not in any chance way, but with earnestness, with science, and
thenceforth the devil takes the command of his own array. For where
drunkenness is, there is unchasteness: where filthy talking, there the
devil is at hand bringing in his own contributions; with such an
entertainment, tell me, dost thou celebrate the mystery of Christ? and
invitest thou the devil?

<span id="iv.iv.xii-p53"></span>I dare say you consider me offensive.
For <span id="page_320">p. 320</span> <span
id="iv.iv.xii-Page_320"></span>this too is a property of extreme
pervertedness, that even one that rebuketh you incurs your ridicule as
one that is austere. Hear ye not Paul, saying, “Whatsoever ye do,
whether ye eat or drink or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of
God”? ([1 Cor. x. 31](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#031.md)<span
id="iv.iv.xii-p53.1"></span>.) But ye do all to ill report and dishonor.
Hear ye not the Prophet, saying, “Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice
unto Him with trembling?” ([Ps. ii.
11](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#011)<span id="iv.iv.xii-p53.2"></span>..md)
But ye are wholly without restraint. <span
id="fr_924"></span>[925](#fn_924.md) Is it not possible both to enjoy
pleasure, and to do so with safety? Art thou desirous of hearing
beautiful songs? Best of all indeed, thou oughtest not; nevertheless, I
condescend if thou wilt have it so: do not hear those Satanic ones, but
the spiritual. Art thou desirous of seeing choirs of dancers? Behold the
choir of Angels. And how is it possible, saith one, to see them? If thou
drive away all these things, even Christ will come to such a marriage,
and Christ being present, the choir of Angels is present also. If thou
wilt, He will even now work miracles as He did then; He will make even
now the water, wine ([John ii](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#000.md)<span
id="iv.iv.xii-p54.1"></span>.); and what is much more wonderful, He will
convert this unstable and dissolving pleasure, this cold desire, and
change it into the spiritual. This is to make of water, wine. Where
pipers are, by no means there is Christ; but even if He should have
entered, He first casts these forth, <span
id="fr_925"></span>[926](#fn_925.md) and then He works His wonders. What
can be more disagreeable than this Satanic pomp? where everything is
inarticulate, everything without significancy; and if there be anything
articulate, again all is shameful, all is noisome.

<span id="iv.iv.xii-p56"></span>Nothing is more pleasurable than virtue,
nothing sweeter than orderliness, nothing more amiable than gravity. Let
any celebrate such a marriage as I speak of; and he shall find the
pleasure; but what sort of marriages these are, take heed. First seek a
husband for the virgin, who will be truly a husband, and a protector; as
though thou wert intending to place a head upon a body; as though about
to give not a slave, but a daughter into his hands. Seek not money, nor
splendor of family, nor greatness of country; all these things are
superfluous; but piety of soul, gentleness, the true understanding, the
fear of God, if thou wishest thy darling to live with pleasure. For if
thou seek a wealthier husband, not only wilt thou not benefit her, but
thou wilt even harm her, by making her a slave instead of free. For the
pleasure she will reap from her golden trinkets will not be so great as
will be the annoyance that comes of her slavery. I pray thee, seek not
these things, but most of all, one of equal condition; if however this
cannot be, rather one poorer than in better circumstances; if at least
thou be desirous not of selling thy daughter to a master, but of giving
her to a husband. When thou hast thoroughly investigated the virtue of
the man, and art about to give her to him, beseech Christ to be present:
for He will not be ashamed to be so; it is the mystery of His presence.
Yea rather beseech Him even in the first instance, to grant her such a
suitor. Be not worse than the servant of Abraham, who, when sent on a
pilgrimage so important, saw whither he ought to have recourse;
wherefore also he obtained everything. When thou art taking anxious
pains, and seeking a husband for her, pray; say unto God, “whomsoever
Thou wilt do Thou provide:” into His hands commit the matter; and He,
honored in this way by thee, will requite thee with honor.

<span id="iv.iv.xii-p57"></span>Two things indeed it is necessary to do;
to commit the thing into His hands, and to seek such an orderly person
as He Himself approves.

<span id="iv.iv.xii-p58"></span>When <span
id="fr_926"></span>[927](#fn_926.md) then thou makest a marriage, go not
round from house to house borrowing mirrors and dresses; for the matter
is not one of display, nor dost thou lead thy daughter to a pageant; but
decking out thine house with what is in it, invite thy neighbors, and
friends, and kindred. As many as thou knowest to be of a good character,
those invite, and bid them be content with what there is. Let no one
from the orchestra be present, for such expense is superfluous, and
unbecoming. Before all the rest, invite Christ. Knowest thou whereby
thou wilt invite Him? Whosoever, saith He, “hath done it to one of these
least, hath done it to Me.” ([Matt. xxv.
40](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#040)<span id="iv.iv.xii-p59.1"></span>..md)
And think it not an annoying thing to invite the poor for Christ’s sake;
to invite harlots is an annoyance. For to invite the poor is a means of
wealth, the other of ruin. Adorn the bride not with these ornaments that
are made of gold, but with gentleness and modesty, and the customary
robes; in place of all golden ornament and braiding, arraying her in
blushes, and shamefacedness, and the not desiring such things. Let there
be no uproar, no confusion; let the bridegroom be called, let him
receive the virgin. The dinners and suppers, let them not be full of
drunkenness, but of abundance and pleasure. See how many good things
will result, whenever we see such marriages as those; but from the
marriages that are now celebrated, (if at least one ought to call them
marriages and not pageants,) how many are the evils! The banquet hall is
no sooner broken up, than straightway comes care and fear, lest aught
that is borrowed should have been lost, and there succeeds to the
pleasure melancholy intolerable. But this distress belongs to the
mother-in-law,—<span id="page_321">p. 321</span> <span
id="iv.iv.xii-Page_321"></span>nay, rather not even is the bride herself
free; all that follows at least belongs to the bride herself. For to see
all broken up, is a ground for sadness, to see the house desolate.

<span id="iv.iv.xii-p60"></span>There is Christ, here is Satan; there is
cheerfulness, here anxious care; there pleasure, here pain; there
expense, here nothing of the kind; there indecency, here modesty; there
envy, here no envy; there drunkenness, here soberness, here health, here
temperance. Bearing in mind all these things, let us stay the evil at
this point, that we may please God, and be counted worthy to obtain the
good things promised to them that love Him, through the grace and love
toward man of our Lord Jesus Christ, with whom, to the Father, together
with the Holy Ghost, be glory, power, honor, now and for ever, and world
without end. Amen.
