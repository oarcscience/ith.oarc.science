<span id="v.v.i-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="v.v.i-p1.1"></span>Chapter 1.—Signs, Their Nature and
Variety.</span>

<span id="v.v.i-p2"></span>1.  <span class="c20"><span
id="v.v.i-p2.1"></span>As</span> when I was writing about things, I
introduced the subject with a warning against attending to anything but
what they are in themselves, <span id="fr_1757"></span>[1758](#fn_1757)
even though they are signs of something else, so now, when I come in its
turn to discuss the subject of signs, I lay down this direction, not to
attend to what they are in themselves, but to the fact that they are
signs, that is, to what they signify.  For a sign is a thing which, over
and above the impression it makes on the senses, causes something else
to come into the mind as a consequence of itself:  as when we see a
footprint, we conclude that an animal whose footprint this is has passed
by; and when we see smoke, we know that there is fire beneath; and when
we hear the voice of a living man, we think of the feeling in his mind;
and when the trumpet sounds, soldiers know that they are to advance or
retreat, or do whatever else the state of the battle requires.

<span id="v.v.i-p4"></span>2.  Now some signs are natural, others
conventional.  Natural signs are those which, apart from any intention
or desire of using them as signs, do yet lead to the knowledge of
something else, as, for example, smoke when it indicates fire.  For it
is not from any intention of making it a sign that it is so, but through
attention to experience we come to know that fire is beneath, even when
nothing but smoke can be seen.  And the footprint of an animal passing
by belongs to this class of signs.  And the countenance of an angry or
sorrowful man indicates the feeling in his mind, independently of his
will:  and in the same way every other emotion of the mind is betrayed
by the tell-tale countenance, even <span id="page_536">p. 536</span>
<span id="v.v.i-Page_536"></span> though we do nothing with the
intention of making it known.  This class of signs, however, it is no
part of my design to discuss at present.  But as it comes under this
division of the subject, I could not altogether pass it over.  It will
be enough to have noticed it thus far.
