<span id="iv.XXI.4-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XXI.4-p1.1"></span>Chapter 4.—Examples from Nature Proving that
Bodies May Remain Unconsumed and Alive in Fire.</span>

<span id="iv.XXI.4-p2"></span>If, therefore, the salamander lives in
fire, as naturalists <span id="fr_1498"></span>[1499](#fn_1498.md) have
recorded, and if certain famous mountains of Sicily have been
continually on fire from the remotest antiquity until now, and yet
remain entire, these are sufficiently convincing examples that
everything which burns is not consumed.  As the soul too, is a proof
that not everything which can suffer pain can also die, why then do they
yet demand that we produce real examples to prove that it is not
incredible that the bodies of men condemned to everlasting punishment
may retain their soul in the fire, may burn without being consumed, and
may suffer without perishing?  For suitable properties will be
communicated to the substance of the flesh by Him who has endowed the
things we see with so marvellous and diverse properties, that their very
multitude prevents our wonder.  For who but God the Creator of all
things has given to the flesh of the peacock its antiseptic property? 
This property, when I first heard of it, seemed to me incredible; but it
happened at Carthage that a bird of this kind was cooked and served up
to me, and, taking a suitable slice of flesh from its breast, I ordered
it to be kept, and when it had been kept as many days as make any other
flesh stinking, it was produced and set before me, and emitted no
offensive smell.  And after it had been laid by for thirty days and
more, it was still in the same state; and a year after, the same still,
except that it was a little more shrivelled, and drier.  Who gave to
chaff such power to freeze that it preserves snow buried under it, and
such power to warm that it ripens green fruit?

<span id="iv.XXI.4-p4"></span>But who can explain the strange properties
of fire itself, which blackens everything it burns, though itself
bright; and which, though of the most beautiful colors, discolors almost
all it touches and feeds upon, and turns blazing fuel into grimy
cinders?  Still this is not laid down as an absolutely uniform law; for,
on the contrary, stones baked in glowing fire themselves also glow, and
though the fire be rather of a red hue, and they white, yet white is
congruous with light, and black with darkness.  Thus, though the fire
burns the wood in calcining the stones, these contrary effects do not
result from the contrariety of the materials.  For though wood and stone
differ, they are not contraries, like black and white, the one of which
colors is produced in the stones, while the other is produced in the
wood by the same action of fire, which imparts its own brightness to the
former, while it begrimes the latter, and which could have no effect on
the one were it not fed by the other.  Then what wonderful properties do
we find in charcoal, which is so brittle that a light tap breaks it and
a slight pressure pulverizes it, and yet is so strong that no moisture
rots it, nor any time causes it to decay.  So enduring is it, that it is
customary in laying down landmarks to put charcoal underneath them, so
that if, after the longest interval, any one raises an action, and
pleads that there is no boundary stone, he may be convicted by the
charcoal below.  What then has enabled it to last so long without
rotting, though buried in the damp earth in which \[its original\] wood
rots, except this same fire which consumes all things?

<span id="iv.XXI.4-p5"></span>Again, let us consider the wonders of
lime; for besides growing white in fire, which makes other things black,
and of which I have already said enough, it has also a mysterious
property of conceiving fire within it.  Itself cold to the touch, it yet
has a hidden store of fire, which is not at once apparent to our senses,
but which experience teaches us, lies as it were slumbering within it
even while unseen.  And it is for this reason called “quick lime,” as if
the fire were the invisible soul quickening the visible substance or
body.  But the marvellous thing is, that this fire is kindled when it is
extinguished.  For to disengage the hidden fire the lime is moistened or
drenched with water, and then, though it be cold before, it becomes hot
by that very application which cools what is hot.  As if the <span
id="page_455">p. 455</span> <span id="iv.XXI.4-Page_455"></span> fire
were departing from the lime and breathing its last, it no longer lies
hid, but appears; and then the lime lying in the coldness of death
cannot be requickened, and what we before called “quick,” we now call
“slaked.”  What can be stranger than this?  Yet there is a greater
marvel still.  For if you treat the lime, not with water, but with oil,
which is as fuel to fire, no amount of oil will heat it.  Now if this
marvel had been told us of some Indian mineral which we had no
opportunity of experimenting upon, we should either have forthwith
pronounced it a falsehood, or certainly should have been greatly
astonished.  But things that daily present themselves to our own
observation we despise, not because they are really less marvellous, but
because they are common; so that even some products of India itself,
remote as it is from ourselves, cease to excite our admiration as soon
as we can admire them at our leisure. <span

<span id="iv.XXI.4-p12"></span>The diamond is a stone possessed by many
among ourselves, especially by jewellers and lapidaries, and the stone
is so hard that it can be wrought neither by iron nor fire, nor, they
say, by anything at all except goat’s blood.  But do you suppose it is
as much admired by those who own it and are familiar with its properties
as by those to whom it is shown for the first time?  Persons who have
not seen it perhaps do not believe what is said of it, or if they do,
they wonder as at a thing beyond their experience; and if they happen to
see it, still they marvel because they are unused to it, but gradually
familiar experience \[of it\] dulls their admiration.  We know that the
loadstone has a wonderful power of attracting iron.  When I first saw it
I was thunderstruck, for I saw an iron ring attracted and suspended by
the stone; and then, as if it had communicated its own property to the
iron it attracted, and had made it a substance like itself, this ring
was put near another, and lifted it up; and as the first ring clung to
the magnet, so did the second ring to the first.  A third and a fourth
were similarly added, so that there hung from the stone a kind of chain
of rings, with their hoops connected, not interlinking, but attached
together by their outer surface.  Who would not be amazed at this virtue
of the stone, subsisting as it does not only in itself, but transmitted
through so many suspended rings, and binding them together by invisible
links?  Yet far more astonishing is what I heard about this stone from
my brother in the episcopate, Severus bishop of Milevis.  He told me
that Bathanarius, once count of Africa, when the bishop was dining with
him, produced a magnet, and held it under a silver plate on which he
placed a bit of iron; then as he moved his hand with the magnet
underneath the plate, the iron upon the plate moved about accordingly. 
The intervening silver was not affected at all, but precisely as the
magnet was moved backwards and forwards below it, no matter how quickly,
so was the iron attracted above.  I have related what I myself have
witnessed; I have related what I was told by one whom I trust as I trust
my own eyes.  Let me further say what I have read about this magnet. 
When a diamond is laid near it, it does not lift iron; or if it has
already lifted it, as soon as the diamond approaches, it drops it. 
These stones come from India.  But if we cease to admire them because
they are now familiar, how much less must they admire them who procure
them very easily and send them to us?  Perhaps they are held as cheap as
we hold lime, which, because it is common, we think nothing of, though
it has the strange property of burning when water, which is wont to
quench fire, is poured on it, and of remaining cool when mixed with oil,
which ordinarily feeds fire.
