<span id="iv.XVII.7-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XVII.7-p1.1"></span>Chapter 7.—Of the Disruption of the Kingdom
of Israel, by Which the Perpetual Division of the Spiritual from the
Carnal Israel Was Prefigured.</span>

<span id="iv.XVII.7-p2"></span>Again Saul sinned through disobedience,
and again Samuel says to him in the word of the Lord, “Because thou hast
despised the word of the Lord, the Lord hath despised thee, that thou
mayest not be king over Israel.” <span
id="fr_1032"></span>[1033](#fn_1032.md)   And again for the same sin, when
Saul confessed it, and prayed for pardon, and besought Samuel to return
with him to appease the Lord, he said, “I will not return with thee: 
for thou hast despised the word of the Lord, and the Lord will despise
thee that thou mayest not be king over Israel.  And Samuel turned his
face to go away, and Saul laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle, and
rent it.  And Samuel said unto him, The Lord hath rent the kingdom from
Israel out of thine hand this day, and will give it to thy neighbor, who
is good above thee, and will divide Israel in twain.  And He will not be
changed, neither will He repent:  for He is not as a man, that He should
repent; who threatens and does not persist.” <span
id="fr_1033"></span>[1034](#fn_1033.md)   He to whom it is said, “The Lord
will despise thee that thou mayest not be king over Israel,” and “The
Lord hath rent the kingdom from Israel out of thine hand this day,”
reigned forty years over Israel,—that is, just as long a time as David
himself,—yet heard this in the first period of his reign, that we may
understand it was said because none of his race was to reign, and that
we may look to the <span id="page_347">p. 347</span> <span
id="iv.XVII.7-Page_347"></span> race of David, whence also is sprung,
according to the flesh, <span id="fr_1034"></span>[1035](#fn_1034.md) the
Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus. <span
id="fr_1035"></span>[1036](#fn_1035.md)

<span id="iv.XVII.7-p7"></span>But the Scripture has not what is read in
most Latin copies, “The Lord hath rent the kingdom of Israel out of
thine hand this day,” but just as we have set it down it is found in the
Greek copies, “The Lord hath rent the kingdom from Israel out of thine
hand;” that the words “out of thine hand” may be understood to mean
“from Israel.”  Therefore this man figuratively represented the people
of Israel, which was to lose the kingdom, Christ Jesus our Lord being
about to reign, not carnally, but spiritually.  And when it is said of
Him, “And will give it to thy neighbor,” that is to be referred to the
fleshly kinship, for Christ, according to the flesh, was of Israel,
whence also Saul sprang.  But what is added, “Good above thee,” may
indeed be understood, “Better than thee,” and indeed some have thus
translated it; but it is better taken thus, “Good above thee,” as
meaning that because He is good, therefore He must be above thee,
according to that other prophetic saying, “Till I put all Thine enemies
under Thy feet.” <span id="fr_1036"></span>[1037](#fn_1036.md)   And among
them is Israel, from whom, as His persecutor, Christ took away the
kingdom; although the Israel in whom there was no guile may have been
there too, a sort of grain, as it were, of that chaff.  For certainly
thence came the apostles, thence so many martyrs, of whom Stephen is the
first, thence so many churches, which the Apostle Paul names, magnifying
God in their conversion.

<span id="iv.XVII.7-p9"></span>Of which thing I do not doubt what
follows is to be understood, “And will divide Israel in twain,” to wit,
into Israel pertaining to the bond woman, and Israel pertaining to the
free.  For these two kinds were at first together, as Abraham still
clave to the bond woman, until the barren, made fruitful by the grace of
God, cried, “Cast out the bond woman and her son.” <span
id="fr_1037"></span>[1038](#fn_1037.md)   We know, indeed, that on account
of the sin of Solomon, in the reign of his son Rehoboam, Israel was
divided in two, and continued so, the separate parts having their own
kings, until that whole nation was overthrown with a great destruction,
and carried away by the Chaldeans.  But what was this to Saul, when, if
any such thing was threatened, it would be threatened against David
himself, whose son Solomon was?  Finally, the Hebrew nation is not now
divided internally, but is dispersed through the earth indiscriminately,
in the fellowship of the same error.  But that division with which God
threatened the kingdom and people in the person of Saul, who represented
them, is shown to be eternal and unchangeable by this which is added,
“And He will not be changed, neither will He repent:  for He is not as a
man, that He should repent; who threatens and does not persist,”—that
is, a man threatens and does not persist, but not God, who does not
repent like man.  For when we read that He repents, a change of
circumstance is meant, flowing from the divine immutable foreknowledge. 
Therefore, when God is said not to repent, it is to be understood that
He does not change.

<span id="iv.XVII.7-p11"></span>We see that this sentence concerning
this division of the people of Israel, divinely uttered in these words,
has been altogether irremediable and quite perpetual.  For whoever have
turned, or are turning, or shall turn thence to Christ, it has been
according to the foreknowledge of God, not according to the one and the
same nature of the human race.  Certainly none of the Israelites, who,
cleaving to Christ, have continued in Him, shall ever be among those
Israelites who persist in being His enemies even to the end of this
life, but shall for ever remain in the separation which is here
foretold.  For the Old Testament, from the Mount Sinai, which gendereth
to bondage, <span id="fr_1038"></span>[1039](#fn_1038.md) profiteth
nothing, unless because it bears witness to the New Testament. 
Otherwise, however long Moses is read, the veil is put over their heart;
but when any one shall turn thence to Christ, the veil shall be taken
away. <span id="fr_1039"></span>[1040](#fn_1039.md)   For the very desire
of those who turn is changed from the old to the new, so that each no
longer desires to obtain carnal but spiritual felicity.  Wherefore that
great prophet Samuel himself, before he had anointed Saul, when he had
cried to the Lord for Israel, and He had heard him, and when he had
offered a whole burnt-offering, as the aliens were coming to battle
against the people of God, and the Lord thundered above them and they
were confused, and fell before Israel and were overcome; \[then\] he
took one stone and set it up between the old and new Massephat
\[Mizpeh\], and called its name Ebenezer, which means “the stone of the
helper,” and said, “Hitherto hath the Lord helped us.” <span
id="fr_1040"></span>[1041](#fn_1040.md)   Massephat is interpreted
“desire.”  That stone of the helper is the mediation of the Saviour, by
which we go from the old Massephat to the new,—that is, from the desire
with which carnal happiness was expected in the carnal kingdom to the
desire with which the truest spiritual happiness is expected in the
kingdom of heaven; and since <span id="page_348">p. 348</span> <span
id="iv.XVII.7-Page_348"></span> nothing is better than that, the Lord
helpeth us hitherto.
