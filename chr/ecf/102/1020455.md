<span id="iv.XVI.6-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XVI.6-p1.1"></span>Chapter 6.—What We are to Understand by God’s
Speaking to the Angels.</span>

<span id="iv.XVI.6-p2"></span>We might have supposed that the words
uttered at the creation of man, “Let us,” and not Let me, “make man,”
were addressed to the angels, had He not added “in our image;” but as we
cannot believe that man was made in the image of angels, or that the
image of God is the same as that of angels, it is proper to refer this
expression to the plurality of the Trinity.  And yet this Trinity, being
one God, even after saying “Let us make,” goes on to say, “And God made
man in His image,” <span id="fr_877"></span>[878](#fn_877.md) and not “Gods
made,” or “in their image.”  And were there any difficulty in applying
to the angels the words, “Come, and let us go down and confound their
speech,” we might refer the plural to the Trinity, as if the Father were
addressing the Son and the Holy Spirit; but it rather belongs to the
angels to approach God by holy movements, that is, by pious thoughts,
and thereby to avail themselves of the unchangeable truth which rules in
the court of heaven as their eternal law.  For they are not themselves
the truth; but partaking in the creative truth, they are moved towards
it as the fountain of life, that what they have not in themselves they
may obtain <span id="page_314">p. 314</span> <span
id="iv.XVI.6-Page_314"></span> in it.  And this movement of theirs is
steady, for they never go back from what they have reached.  And to
these angels God does not speak, as we speak to one another, or to God,
or to angels, or as the angels speak to us, or as God speaks to us
through them:  He speaks to them in an ineffable manner of His own, and
that which He says is conveyed to us in a manner suited to our
capacity.  For the speaking of God antecedent and superior to all His
works, is the immutable reason of His work:  it has no noisy and passing
sound, but an energy eternally abiding and producing results in time. 
Thus He speaks to the holy angels; but to us, who are far off, He speaks
otherwise.  When, however, we hear with the inner ear some part of the
speech of God, we approximate to the angels.  But in this work I need
not labor to give an account of the ways in which God speaks.  For
either the unchangeable Truth speaks directly to the mind of the
rational creature in some indescribable way, or speaks through the
changeable creature, either presenting spiritual images to our spirit,
or bodily voices to our bodily sense.

<span id="iv.XVI.6-p4"></span>The words, “Nothing will be restrained
from them which they have imagined to do,” <span
id="fr_878"></span>[879](#fn_878.md) are assuredly not meant as an
affirmation, but as an interrogation, such as is used by persons
threatening, as *e.g*., when Dido exclaims,

<span id="iv.XVI.6-p6"></span>“They will not take arms and
pursue?” <span id="fr_879"></span>[880](#fn_879.md)

<span id="iv.XVI.6-p8"></span>We are to understand the words as if it
had been said, Shall nothing be restrained from them which they have
imagined to do? <span id="fr_880"></span>[881](#fn_880.md)   From these
three men, therefore, the three sons of Noah we mean, 73, or rather, as
the catalogue will show, 72 nations and as many languages were dispersed
over the earth, and as they increased filled even the islands.  But the
nations multiplied much more than the languages.  For even in Africa we
know several barbarous nations which have but one language; and who can
doubt that, as the human race increased, men contrived to pass to the
islands in ships?
