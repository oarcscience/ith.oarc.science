<span id="iv.XVIII.39-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XVIII.39-p1.1"></span>Chapter 39.—About the Hebrew Written
Characters Which that Language Always Possessed.</span>

<span id="iv.XVIII.39-p2"></span>Now we must not believe that Heber,
from whose name the word Hebrew is derived, preserved and transmitted
the Hebrew language to Abraham only as a spoken language, and that the
Hebrew letters began with the giving of the law through Moses; but
rather that this language, along with its letters, was preserved by that
succession of fathers.  Moses, indeed, appointed some among the people
of God to teach letters, before they could know any letters of the
divine law.  The Scripture calls these men <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.XVIII.39-p2.1"></span>γραμματεισαγωγεῖς</span>, who may be called
in Latin *inductores* or *introductores* of letters, because they, as it
were, introduce them into the hearts of the learners, or rather lead
those whom they teach into them.  Therefore no nation could vaunt itself
over our patriarchs and prophets by any wicked vanity for the antiquity
of its wisdom; since not even Egypt, which is wont falsely and vainly to
glory in the antiquity of her doctrines, is found to have preceded in
time the wisdom of our patriarchs in her own wisdom, such as it is. 
Neither will any one dare to say that they were most skillful in
wonderful sciences <span id="page_384">p. 384</span> <span
id="iv.XVIII.39-Page_384"></span> before they knew letters, that is,
before Isis came and taught them there.  Besides, what, for the most
part, was that memorable doctrine of theirs which was called wisdom but
astronomy, and it may be some other sciences of that kind, which usually
have more power to exercise men’s wit than to enlighten their minds with
true wisdom?  As regards philosophy, which professes to teach men
something which shall make them happy, studies of that kind flourished
in those lands about the times of Mercury, whom they called
Trismegistus, long before the sages and philosophers of Greece, but yet
after Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph, and even after Moses himself. 
At that time, indeed, when Moses was born, Atlas is found to have lived,
that great astronomer, the brother of Prometheus, and maternal grandson
of the elder Mercury, of whom that Mercury Trismegistus was the
grandson.
