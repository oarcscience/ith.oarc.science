<span id="v.v.xxiii-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="v.v.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 23.—Why We Repudiate Arts of
Divination.</span>

<span id="v.v.xxiii-p2"></span>35.  For in this way it comes to pass
that men who lust after evil things are, by a secret <span
id="page_547">p. 547</span> <span id="v.v.xxiii-Page_547"></span>
judgment of God, delivered over to be mocked and deceived, as the just
reward of their evil desires.  For they are deluded and imposed on by
the false angels, to whom the lowest part of the world has been put in
subjection by the law of God’s providence, and in accordance with His
most admirable arrangement of things.  And the result of these delusions
and deceptions is, that through these superstitious and baneful modes of
divination many things in the past and future are made known, and turn
out just as they are foretold and in the case of those who practise
superstitious observances, many things turn out agreeably to their
observances, and ensnared by these successes, they become more eagerly
inquisitive, and involve themselves further and further in a labyrinth
of most pernicious error.  And to our advantage, the Word of God is not
silent about this species of fornication of the soul; and it does not
warn the soul against following such practices on the ground that those
who profess them speak lies, but it says, “Even if what they tell you
should come to pass, hearken not unto them.” <span
id="fr_1805"></span>[1806](#fn_1805)   For though the ghost of the dead
Samuel foretold the truth to King Saul, <span
id="fr_1806"></span>[1807](#fn_1806) that does not make such
sacrilegious observances as those by which his ghost was brought up the
less detestable; and though the ventriloquist woman <span
id="fr_1807"></span>[1808](#fn_1807) in the Acts of the Apostles bore
true testimony to the apostles of the Lord, the Apostle Paul did not
spare the evil spirit on that account, but rebuked and cast it out, and
so made the woman clean. <span id="fr_1808"></span>[1809](#fn_1808)

<span id="v.v.xxiii-p7"></span>36.  All arts of this sort, therefore,
are either nullities, or are part of a guilty superstition, springing
out of a baleful fellowship between men and devils, and are to be
utterly repudiated and avoided by the Christian as the covenants of a
false and treacherous friendship.  “Not as if the idol were anything,”
says the apostle; “but because the things which they sacrifice they
sacrifice to devils and not to God; and I would not that ye should have
fellowship with devils.” <span id="fr_1809"></span>[1810](#fn_1809)  
Now what the apostle has said about idols and the sacrifices offered in
their honor, that we ought to feel in regard to all fancied signs which
lead either to the worship of idols, or to worshipping creation or its
parts instead of God, or which are connected with attention to medicinal
charms and other observances for these are not appointed by God as the
public means of promoting love towards God and our neighbor, but they
waste the hearts of wretched men in private and selfish strivings after
temporal things.  Accordingly, in regard to all these branches of
knowledge, we must fear and shun the fellowship of demons, who, with the
Devil their prince, strive only to shut and bar the door against our
return.  As, then, from the stars which God created and ordained, men
have drawn lying omens of their own fancy, so also from things that are
born, or in any other way come into existence under the government of
God’s providence, if there chance only to be something unusual in the
occurrence,—as when a mule brings forth young, or an object is struck by
lightning,—men have frequently drawn omens by conjectures of their own,
and have committed them to writing, as if they had drawn them by rule.
