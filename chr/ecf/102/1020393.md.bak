id="iv.XIV.1-p1.1"></span>Chapter 1.—That the Disobedience of the First
Man Would Have Plunged All Men into the Endless Misery of the Second
Death, Had Not the Grace of God Rescued Many.</span>

<span id="iv.XIV.1-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.XIV.1-p2.1"></span>We</span> have already stated in the preceding
books that God, desiring not only that the human race might be able by
their similarity of nature to associate with one another, but also that
they might be bound together in harmony and peace by the ties of
relationship, was pleased to derive all men from one individual, and
created man with such a nature that the members of the race should not
have died, had not the two first (of whom the one was created out of
nothing, and the other out of him) merited this by their disobedience;
for by them so great a sin was committed, that by it the human nature
was altered for the worse, and was transmitted also to their posterity,
liable to sin and subject to death.  And the kingdom of death so reigned
over men, that the deserved penalty of sin would have hurled all
headlong even into the second death, of which there is no end, had not
the undeserved grace of God saved some therefrom.  And thus it has come
to pass, that though there are very many and great nations all over the
earth, whose rites and customs, speech, arms, and dress, are
distinguished by marked differences, yet there are no more than two
kinds of human society, which we may justly call two cities, according
to the language of our Scriptures.  The one consists of those who wish
to live after the flesh, the other of those who wish to live after the
spirit; and when they severally achieve what they wish, they live in
peace, each after their kind.
