<span id="iv.XI.30-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XI.30-p1.1"></span>Chapter 30.—Of the Perfection of the Number
Six, Which is the First of the Numbers Which is Composed of Its Aliquot
Parts.</span>

<span id="iv.XI.30-p2"></span>These works are recorded to have been
completed in six days (the same day being six times repeated), because
six is a perfect number,—not because God required a protracted time, as
if He could not at once create all things, which then should mark the
course of time by the movements proper to them, but because the
perfection of the works was signified by the number six.  For the number
six is the first which is made up of its own <span
id="fr_500"></span>[501](#fn_500.md) parts, *i.e*., of its sixth, third,
and half, which are respectively one, two, and three, and which make a
total of six.  In this way of looking at a number, those are said to be
its parts which exactly divide it, as a half, a third, a fourth, or a
fraction with any denominator, *e.g*., four is a part of nine, but not
therefore an aliquot part; but one is, for it is the ninth part; and
three is, for it is the third.  Yet these two parts, the ninth and the
third, or one and three, are far from making its whole sum of nine.  So
again, in the number ten, four is a part, yet does not divide it; but
one is an aliquot part, for it is a tenth; so it has a fifth, which is
two; and a half, which is five.  But these three parts, a tenth, a
fifth, and a half, or one, two, and five, added together, do not make
ten, but eight.  Of the number twelve, again, the parts added together
exceed the whole; for it has a twelfth, that is, one; a sixth, or two; a
fourth, which is three; a third, which is four; and a half, which is
six.  But one, two, three, four, and six make up, not twelve, but more,
viz., sixteen.  So much I have thought fit to state for the sake of
illustrating <span id="page_223">p. 223</span> <span
id="iv.XI.30-Page_223"></span> the perfection of the number six, which
is, as I said, the first which is exactly made up of its own parts added
together; and in this number of days God finished His work. <span
id="fr_501"></span>[502](#fn_501.md)   And, therefore, we must not despise
the science of numbers, which, in many passages of holy Scripture, is
found to be of eminent service to the careful interpreter. <span
id="fr_502"></span>[503](#fn_502.md)   Neither has it been without reason
numbered among God’s praises, “Thou hast ordered all things in number,
and measure, and weight.” <span id="fr_503"></span>[504](#fn_503.md)
