<span id="iv.VIII.5-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.VIII.5-p1.1"></span>Chapter 5.—That It is Especially with the
Platonists that We Must Carry on Our Disputations on Matters of
Theology, Their Opinions Being Preferable to Those of All Other
Philosophers.</span>

<span id="iv.VIII.5-p2"></span>If, then, Plato defined the wise man as
one who imitates, knows, loves this God, and who is rendered blessed
through fellowship with Him in His own blessedness, why discuss with the
other philosophers?  It is evident that none come nearer to us than the
Platonists.  To them, therefore, let that fabulous theology give place
which delights the minds of men with the crimes of the gods; and that
civil theology also, in which impure demons, under the name of gods,
have seduced the peoples of the earth given up to earthly pleasures,
desiring to be honored by the errors of men, and by filling the minds of
their worshippers with impure desires, exciting them to make the
representation of their crimes one of the rites of their worship, whilst
they themselves found in the spectators of these exhibitions a most
pleasing spectacle,—a theology in which, whatever was honorable in the
temple, was defiled by its mixture with the obscenity of the theatre,
and whatever was base in the theatre was vindicated by the abominations
of the temples.  To these philosophers also the interpretations of Varro
must give place, in which he explains the sacred rites as having
reference to heaven and earth, and to the seeds and operations of
perishable things; for, in the first place, those rites have not the
signification which he would have men believe is attached to them, and
therefore truth does not follow him in his attempt so to interpret them;
and even if they had this signification, still those things ought not to
be worshipped by the rational soul as its god which are placed below it
in the scale of nature, nor ought the soul to prefer to itself as gods
things to which the true God has given it the preference.  The same must
be said of those writings pertaining to the sacred rites, which Numa
Pompilius took care to conceal by causing them to be buried along with
himself, and which, when they were afterwards turned up by the plough,
were burned by order of the senate.  And, to treat Numa with all honor,
let us mention as belonging to the same rank as these writings that
which Alexander of Macedon wrote to his mother as communicated to him by
Leo, an Egyptian high priest.  In this letter not only Picus and Faunus,
and Æneas and Romulus or even Hercules, and Æsculapius and Liber, born
of Semele, and the twin sons of Tyndareus, or any other mortals who have
been deified, but even the principal gods themselves, <span
id="fr_298"></span>[299](#fn_298.md) to whom Cicero, in his Tusculan
questions, <span id="fr_299"></span>[300](#fn_299.md) alludes without
mentioning their names, Jupiter, Juno, Saturn, Vulcan, Vesta, and many
others whom Varro attempts to identify with the parts or the elements of
the world, are shown to have been men.  There is, as we have said, a
similarity between this case <span id="page_148">p. 148</span> <span
id="iv.VIII.5-Page_148"></span> and that of Numa; for the priest being
afraid because he had revealed a mystery, earnestly begged of Alexander
to command his mother to burn the letter which conveyed these
communications to her.  Let these two theologies, then, the fabulous and
the civil, give place to the Platonic philosophers, who have recognized
the true God as the author of all things, the source of the light of
truth, and the bountiful bestower of all blessedness.  And not these
only, but to these great acknowledgers of so great a God, those
philosophers must yield who, having their mind enslaved to their body,
supposed the principles of all things to be material; as Thales, who
held that the first principle of all things was water; Anaximenes, that
it was air; the Stoics, that it was fire; Epicurus, who affirmed that it
consisted of atoms, that is to say, of minute corpuscules; and many
others whom it is needless to enumerate, but who believed that bodies,
simple or compound, animate or inanimate, but nevertheless bodies, were
the cause and principle of all things.  For some of them—as, for
instance, the Epicureans—believed that living things could originate
from things without life; others held that all things living or without
life spring from a living principle, but that, nevertheless, all things,
being material, spring from a material principle.  For the Stoics
thought that fire, that is, one of the four material elements of which
this visible world is composed, was both living and intelligent, the
maker of the world and of all things contained in it,—that it was in
fact God.  These and others like them have only been able to suppose
that which their hearts enslaved to sense have vainly suggested to
them.  And yet they have within themselves something which they could
not see:  they represented to themselves inwardly things which they had
seen without, even when they were not seeing them, but only thinking of
them.  But this representation in thought is no longer a body, but only
the similitude of a body; and that faculty of the mind by which this
similitude of a body is seen is neither a body nor the similitude of a
body; and the faculty which judges whether the representation is
beautiful or ugly is without doubt superior to the object judged of. 
This principle is the understanding of man, the rational soul; and it is
certainly not a body, since that similitude of a body which it beholds
and judges of is itself not a body.  The soul is neither earth, nor
water, nor air, nor fire, of which four bodies, called the four
elements, we see that this world is composed.  And if the soul is not a
body, how should God, its Creator, be a body?  Let all those
philosophers, then, give place, as we have said, to the Platonists, and
those also who have been ashamed to say that God is a body, but yet have
thought that our souls are of the same nature as God.  They have not
been staggered by the great changeableness of the soul,—an attribute
which it would be impious to ascribe to the divine nature,—but they say
it is the body which changes the soul, for in itself it is
unchangeable.  As well might they say, “Flesh is wounded by some body,
for in itself it is invulnerable.”  In a word, that which is
unchangeable can be changed by nothing, so that that which can be
changed by the body cannot properly be said to be immutable.
