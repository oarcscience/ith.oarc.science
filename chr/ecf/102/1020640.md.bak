<span id="iv.XXI.7-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XXI.7-p1.1"></span>Chapter 7.—That the Ultimate Reason for
Believing Miracles is the Omnipotence of the Creator.</span>

<span id="iv.XXI.7-p2"></span>Why, then, cannot God effect both that the
bodies of the dead shall rise, and that the bodies of the damned shall
be tormented in everlasting fire,—God, who made the world <span
id="page_458">p. 458</span> <span id="iv.XXI.7-Page_458"></span> full of
countless miracles in sky, earth, air, and waters, while itself is a
miracle unquestionably greater and more admirable than all the marvels
it is filled with?  But those with whom or against whom we are arguing,
who believe both that there is a God who made the world, and that there
are gods created by Him who administer the world’s laws as His
viceregents,—our adversaries, I say, who, so far from denying
emphatically, assert that there are powers in the world which effect
marvellous results (whether of their own accord, or because they are
invoked by some rite or prayer, or in some magical way), when we lay
before them the wonderful properties of other things which are neither
rational animals nor rational spirits, but such material objects as
those we have just cited, are in the habit of replying, This is their
natural property, their nature; these are the powers naturally belonging
to them.  Thus the whole reason why Agrigentine salt dissolves in fire
and crackles in water is that this is its nature.  Yet this seems rather
contrary to nature, which has given not to fire but to water the power
of melting salt, and the power of scorching it not to water but to
fire.  But this they say, is the natural property of *this* salt, to
show effects contrary to these.  The same reason, therefore, is assigned
to account for that Garamantian fountain, of which one and the same
runlet is chill by day and boiling by night, so that in either extreme
it cannot be touched.  So also of that other fountain which, though it
is cold to the touch, and though it, like other fountains, extinguishes
a lighted torch, yet, unlike other fountains, and in a surprising
manner, kindles an extinguished torch.  So of the asbestos stone, which,
though it has no heat of its own, yet when kindled by fire applied to
it, cannot be extinguished.  And so of the rest, which I am weary of
reciting, and in which, though there seems to be an extraordinary
property contrary to nature, yet no other reason is given for them than
this, that this is their nature,—a brief reason truly, and, I own, a
satisfactory reply.  But since God is the author of all natures, how is
it that our adversaries, when they refuse to believe what we affirm, on
the ground that it is impossible, are unwilling to accept from us a
better explanation than their own, viz., that this is the will of
Almighty God,—for certainly He is called Almighty only because He is
mighty to do all He will,—He who was able to create so many marvels, not
only unknown, but very well ascertained, as I have been showing, and
which, were they not under our own observation, or reported by recent
and credible witnesses, would certainly be pronounced impossible?  For
as for those marvels which have no other testimony than the writers in
whose books we read them, and who wrote without being divinely
instructed, and are therefore liable to human error, we cannot justly
blame any one who declines to believe them.

<span id="iv.XXI.7-p3"></span>For my own part, I do not wish all the
marvels I have cited to be rashly accepted, for I do not myself believe
them implicitly, save those which have either come under my own
observation, or which any one can readily verify, such as the lime which
is heated by water and cooled by oil; the magnet which by its mysterious
and insensible suction attracts the iron, but has no affect on a straw;
the peacock’s flesh which triumphs over the corruption from which not
the flesh of Plato is exempt; the chaff so chilling that it prevents
snow from melting, so heating that it forces apples to ripen; the
glowing fire, which, in accordance with its glowing appearance, whitens
the stones it bakes, while, contrary to its glowing appearance, it
begrimes most things it burns (just as dirty stains are made by oil,
however pure it be, and as the lines drawn by white silver are black);
the charcoal, too, which by the action of fire is so completely changed
from its original, that a finely marked piece of wood becomes hideous,
the tough becomes brittle, the decaying incorruptible.  Some of these
things I know in common with many other persons, some of them in common
with all men; and there are many others which I have not room to insert
in this book.  But of those which I have cited, though I have not myself
seen, but only read about them, I have been unable to find trustworthy
witnesses from whom I could ascertain whether they are facts, except in
the case of that fountain in which burning torches are extinguished and
extinguished torches lit, and of the apples of Sodom, which are ripe to
appearance, but are filled with dust.  And indeed I have not met with
any who said they had seen that fountain in Epirus, but with some who
knew there was a similar fountain in Gaul not far from Grenoble.  The
fruit of the trees of Sodom, however, is not only spoken of in books
worthy of credit, but so many persons say that they have seen it that I
cannot doubt the fact.  But the rest of the prodigies I receive without
definitely affirming or denying them; and I have cited them because I
read them in the authors of our adversaries, and that I might prove how
many things many among themselves believe, because they are written in
the works of their own literary men, though no rational explanation of
them is given, and yet they scorn to <span id="page_459">p. 459</span>
<span id="iv.XXI.7-Page_459"></span> believe us when we assert that
Almighty God will do what is beyond their experience and observation;
and this they do even though we assign a reason for His work.  For what
better and stronger reason for such things can be given than to say that
the Almighty is able to bring them to pass, and will bring them to pass,
having predicted them in those books in which many other marvels which
have already come to pass were predicted?  Those things which are
regarded as impossible will be accomplished according to the word, and
by the power of that God who predicted and effected that the incredulous
nations should believe incredible wonders.
