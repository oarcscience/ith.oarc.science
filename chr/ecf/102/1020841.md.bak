id="v.IV_1.23-p1.1"></span>Chapter 23.—How the Various Styles Should Be
Mingled.</span>

<span id="v.IV_1.23-p2"></span>52.  Now it is a matter of importance to
determine what style should be alternated with what other, and the
places where it is necessary that any particular style should be used. 
In the majestic style, for instance, it is always, or almost always,
desirable that the introduction should be temperate.  And the speaker
has it in his discretion to use the subdued style even where the
majestic would be allowable, in order that the majestic when it is used
may be the more majestic by comparison, and may as it were shine out
with greater brilliance from the dark background.  Again, whatever may
be the style of the speech or writing, when knotty questions turn up for
solution, accuracy of distinction is required, and this naturally
demands the subdued style.  And accordingly this style must be used in
alternation with the other two styles whenever questions of that sort
turn up; just as we must use the temperate style, no matter what may be
the general tone of the discourse, whenever praise or blame is to be
given without any ulterior reference to the condemnation or acquittal of
any one, or to obtaining the concurrence of any one in a course of
action.  In the majestic style, then, and in the quiet likewise, both
the other two styles occasionally find place.  The temperate style, on
the other hand, not indeed always, but occasionally, needs the quiet
style; for example, when, as I have said, a knotty question comes up to
be settled, or when some points that are susceptible of ornament are
left unadorned and expressed in the quiet style, in order to give
greater effect to certain exuberances (as they may be called) of
ornament.  But the temperate style never needs the aid of the majestic;
for its object is to gratify, never to excite, the mind.
