<p class="c34"><a name="iv.VI.3-p1"></A><span class="c2"><a name="iv.VI.3-p1.1"></A>Chapter 3.&#8212;Varro&#146;s Distribution of His Book Which He Composed Concerning the Antiquities of Human and Divine Things.</span></p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="iv.VI.3-p2"></A>He wrote forty-one books of antiquities.&#160; These he divided into human and divine things.&#160; Twenty-five he devoted to human things, sixteen to divine things; following this plan in that division,&#8212;namely, to give six books to each of the four divisions of human things.&#160; For he directs his attention to these considerations:&#160; who perform, where they perform, when they perform, what they perform.&#160; Therefore in the first six books he wrote concerning men; in the second six, concerning places; in the third six, concerning times; in the fourth and last six, concerning things.&#160; Four times six, however, make only twenty-four.&#160; But he placed at the head of them one separate work, which spoke of all these things conjointly.</p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="iv.VI.3-p3"></A>In divine things, the same order he preserved throughout, as far as concerns those things which are performed to the gods.&#160; For sacred things are performed by men in places and times.&#160; These four things I have mentioned he embraced in twelve books, allotting three to each.&#160; For he wrote the first three concerning men, the following three concerning places, the third three concerning times, and the fourth three concerning sacred rites,&#8212;showing who should perform, where they should perform, when they should perform, what they should perform, with most subtle distinction.&#160; But because it was necessary to say&#8212;and that especially was expected&#8212;to whom they should perform sacred rites, he wrote concerning the gods themselves the last three books; and these five times three made fifteen.&#160; But they are in all, as we have said, sixteen.&#160; For he put also at the beginning of these one distinct book, speaking by way of introduction of all which follows; which being finished, he proceeded to subdivide the first three in that five-fold distribution which pertain to men, making the first concerning high priests, the second concerning augurs, the third concerning the fifteen men presiding over the sacred ceremonies.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_237"></A><A HREF="#fn_237"><FONT SIZE="1">238</FONT></A>
&#160; The second three he made concerning places, speaking in one of them concerning their chapels, in the second concerning their temples, and in the third concerning religious places.&#160; The next three which follow these, and pertain to times,&#8212;that is, to festival days,&#8212;he distributed so as to make one concerning holidays, the other concerning the circus games, and the third concerning scenic plays.&#160; Of the fourth three, pertaining to sacred things, he devoted one to consecrations, another to private, the last to public, sacred rites.&#160; In the three which remain, the gods themselves follow this pompous train, as it were, for whom all this culture has been expended.&#160; In the first book are the certain gods, in the second the uncertain, in the third, and last of all, the chief and select gods.</p>
