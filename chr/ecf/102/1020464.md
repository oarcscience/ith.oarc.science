<span id="iv.XVI.15-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XVI.15-p1.1"></span>Chapter 15.—Of the Time of the Migration of
Abraham, When, According to the Commandment of God, He Went Out from
Haran.</span>

<span id="iv.XVI.15-p2"></span>When, after the record of the death of
Terah, the father of Abraham, we next read, “And the Lord said to Abram,
Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father’s
house,” <span id="fr_893"></span>[894](#fn_893) etc., it is not to be
supposed, because this follows in the order of the narrative, that it
also followed in the chronological order of events.  For if it were so,
there would be an insoluble difficulty.  For after these words of God
which were spoken to Abraham, the Scripture says:  “And Abram departed,
as the Lord had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him.  Now Abraham was
seventy-five years old when he departed out of Haran.” <span
id="fr_894"></span>[895](#fn_894)   How can this be true if he departed
from Haran after his father’s death?  For when Terah was seventy years
old, as is intimated above, he begat Abraham; and if to this number we
add the seventy-five years which Abraham reckoned when he went out of
Haran, we get 145 years.  Therefore that <span id="page_320">p.
320</span> <span id="iv.XVI.15-Page_320"></span> was the number of the
years of Terah, when Abraham departed out of that city of Mesopotamia;
for he had reached the seventy-fifth year of his life, and thus his
father, who begat him in the seventieth year of his life, had reached,
as was said, his 145th.  Therefore he did not depart thence after his
father’s death, that is, after the 205 years his father lived; but the
year of his departure from that place, seeing it was his seventy-fifth,
is inferred beyond a doubt to have been the 145th of his father, who
begat him in his seventieth year.  And thus it is to be understood that
the Scripture, according to its custom, has gone back to the time which
had already been passed by the narrative; just as above, when it had
mentioned the grandsons of Noah, it said that they were in their nations
and tongues; and yet afterwards, as if this also had followed in order
of time, it says, “And the whole earth was of one lip, and one speech
for all.” <span id="fr_895"></span>[896](#fn_895)   How, then, could
they be said to be in their own nations and according to their own
tongues, if there was one for all; except because the narrative goes
back to gather up what it had passed over?  Here, too, in the same way,
after saying, “And the days of Terah in Haran were 205 years, and Terah
died in Haran,” the Scripture, going back to what had been passed over
in order to complete what had been begun about Terah, says, “And the
Lord said to Abram, Get thee out of thy country,” <span
id="fr_896"></span>[897](#fn_896) etc.  After which words of God it is
added, “And Abram departed, as the Lord spake unto him; and Lot went
with him.  But Abram was seventy-five years old when he departed out of
Haran.”  Therefore it was done when his father was in the 145th year of
his age; for it was then the seventy-fifth of his own.  But this
question is also solved in another way, that the seventy-five years of
Abraham when he departed out of Haran are reckoned from the year in
which he was delivered from the fire of the Chaldeans, not from that of
his birth, as if he was rather to be held as having been born then.

<span id="iv.XVI.15-p7"></span>Now the blessed Stephen, in narrating
these things in the Acts of the Apostles, says:  “The God of glory
appeared unto our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he
dwelt in Charran, and said unto him, Get thee out of thy country, and
from thy kindred, and from thy father’s house, and come into the land
which I will show thee.” <span id="fr_897"></span>[898](#fn_897)  
According to these words of Stephen, God spoke to Abraham, not after the
death of his father, who certainly died in Haran, where his son also
dwelt with him, but before he dwelt in that city, although he was
already in Mesopotamia.  Therefore he had already departed from the
Chaldeans.  So that when Stephen adds, “Then Abraham went out of the
land of the Chaldeans, and dwelt in Charran,” <span
id="fr_898"></span>[899](#fn_898) this does not point out what took
place after God spoke to him (for it was not after these words of God
that he went out of the land of the Chaldeans, since he says that God
spoke to him in Mesopotamia), but the word “then” which he uses refers
to that whole period from his going out of the land of the Chaldeans and
dwelling in Haran.  Likewise in what follows, “And thenceforth, when his
father was dead, he settled him in this land, wherein ye now dwell, and
your fathers,” he does not say, after his father was dead he went out
from Haran; but thenceforth he settled him here, after his father was
dead.  It is to be understood, therefore, that God had spoken to Abraham
when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Haran; but that he came
to Haran with his father, keeping in mind the precept of God, and that
he went out thence in his own seventy-fifth year, which was his father’s
145th.  But he says that his settlement in the land of Canaan, not his
going forth from Haran, took place after his father’s death; because his
father was already dead when he purchased the land, and personally
entered on possession of it.  But when, on his having already settled in
Mesopotamia, that is, already gone out of the land of the Chaldeans, God
says, “Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy
father’s house,” <span id="fr_899"></span>[900](#fn_899) this means, not
that he should cast out his body from thence, for he had already done
that, but that he should tear away his soul.  For he had not gone out
from thence in mind, if he was held by the hope and desire of
returning,—a hope and desire which was to be cut off by God’s command
and help, and by his own obedience.  It would indeed be no incredible
supposition that afterwards, when Nahor followed his father, Abraham
then fulfilled the precept of the Lord, that he should depart out of
Haran with Sarah his wife and Lot his brother’s son.
