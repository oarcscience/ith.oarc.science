<span id="v.vi.vi-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="v.vi.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 6.—Utility of the Bondage of the
Jews.</span>

<span id="v.vi.vi-p2"></span>10.  This bondage, however, in the case of
the Jewish people, differed widely from what it was in the case of the
other nations; because, though the former were in bondage to temporal
things, it was in such a way that in all these the One God was put
before their minds.  And although they paid attention to the signs of
spiritual realities in place of the realities themselves, not knowing to
what the signs referred, still they had this conviction rooted in their
minds, that in subjecting themselves to such a bondage they were doing
the pleasure of the one invisible God of all.  And the apostle describes
this bondage as being like to that of boys under the guidance of a
schoolmaster. <span id="fr_1854"></span>[1855](#fn_1854.md)   And those who
clung obstinately to such signs could not endure our Lord’s neglect of
them when the time for their revelation had come; and hence their
leaders brought it as a charge against Him that He healed on the
Sabbath, and the people, clinging to these signs as if they were
realities, could not believe that one who refused to observe them in the
way the Jews did was God, or came from God.  But those who did believe,
from among whom the first Church at Jerusalem was formed, showed clearly
how great an advantage it had been to be so guided by the schoolmaster
that signs, which had been for a season imposed on the obedient, fixed
the thoughts of those who observed them on the worship of the One God
who made heaven and earth.  These men, because they had been very near
to spiritual things (for even in the temporal and carnal offerings and
types, though they did not clearly apprehend their spiritual meaning,
they had learnt to adore the One Eternal God,) were filled with such a
measure of the Holy Spirit that they sold all their goods, and laid
their price at the apostles’ feet to be distributed among the
needy, <span id="fr_1855"></span>[1856](#fn_1855.md) and consecrated
themselves wholly to God as a new temple, of which the old temple they
were serving was but the earthly type.

<span id="v.vi.vi-p5"></span>11.  Now it is not recorded that any of the
Gentile churches did this, because men who had for their gods idols made
with hands had not been so near to spiritual things.
