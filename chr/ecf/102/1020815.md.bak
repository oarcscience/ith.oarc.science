<span id="v.vi.xxxv-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="v.vi.xxxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 35.—The Fifth Rule of
Tichonius.</span>

<span id="v.vi.xxxv-p2"></span>50.  The fifth rule Tichonius lays down
is one he designates *of times*,—a rule by which we can frequently
discover or conjecture quantities of time which are not expressly
mentioned in Scripture.  And he says that this rule applies in two
ways:  either to the figure of speech called *synecdoche*, or to
legitimate numbers.  The figure synecdoche either puts the part for the
whole, or the whole for the part.  As, for example, in reference to the
time when, in the presence of only three of His disciples, our Lord was
transfigured on the mount, so that His face shone as the sun, and His
raiment was white as snow, one evangelist says that this event occurred
“after eight days,” <span id="fr_1917"></span>[1918](#fn_1917.md) while
another says that it occurred “after six days.” <span
id="fr_1918"></span>[1919](#fn_1918.md)   Now both of these statements
about the number of days cannot be true, unless we suppose that the
writer who says “after eight days,” counted the latter part of the day
on which Christ uttered the prediction and the first part of the day on
which he showed its fulfillment as two whole days; while the writer who
says “after six days,” counted only the whole unbroken days between
these two.  This figure of speech, which puts the part for the whole,
explains also the great question about the resurrection of Christ.  For
unless to the latter part of the day on which He suffered we join the
previous night, and count it as a whole day, and to the latter part of
the night in which He arose we join the Lord’s day which was just
dawning, and count it also a whole day, we cannot make out the three
days and three nights during which He foretold that He would be in the
heart of the earth. <span id="fr_1919"></span>[1920](#fn_1919.md)

<span id="v.vi.xxxv-p6"></span>51.  In the next place, our author calls
those numbers *legitimate* which Holy Scripture more highly favors such
as seven, or ten, or twelve, or any of the other numbers which the
diligent reader of Scripture soon comes to know.  Now numbers of this
sort are often put for time universal; as for example, “Seven times in
the day do I praise Thee,” means just the same as “His praise shall
continually be in my mouth.” <span id="fr_1920"></span>[1921](#fn_1920.md)
  And their force is exactly the same, either when multiplied by ten, as
seventy and seven hundred (whence the seventy years mentioned in
Jeremiah may be taken in a spiritual sense for the whole time during
which the Church is a sojourner among aliens); <span
id="fr_1921"></span>[1922](#fn_1921.md) or when multiplied into themselves,
as ten into ten gives one hundred, and twelve into twelve gives one
hundred and forty-four, which last number is <span id="page_572">p.
572</span> <span id="v.vi.xxxv-Page_572"></span> used in the Apocalypse
to signify the whole body of the saints. <span
id="fr_1922"></span>[1923](#fn_1922.md)   Hence it appears that it is not
merely questions about times that are to be settled by these numbers,
but that their significance is of much wider application, and extends to
many subjects.  That number in the Apocalypse, for example, mentioned
above, has not reference to times, but to men.
