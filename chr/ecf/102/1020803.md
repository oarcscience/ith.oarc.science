id="v.vi.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 23.—Rule Regarding the Narrative of
Sins of Great Men.</span>

<span id="v.vi.xxiii-p2"></span>33.  And when he reads of the sins of
great men, although he may be able to see and to trace out in them a
figure of things to come, let him yet put the literal fact to this use
also, to teach him not to dare to vaunt himself in his own good deeds,
and in comparison with his own righteousness, to despise others as
sinners, when he sees in the case of men so eminent both the storms that
are to be avoided and the shipwrecks that are to be wept over.  For the
sins of these men were recorded to this end, that men might everywhere
and always tremble at that saying of the apostle:  “Wherefore let him
that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.” <span
id="fr_1878"></span>[1879](#fn_1878.md)   For there is hardly a page of
Scripture on which it is not clearly written that God resisteth the
proud and giveth grace to the humble. <span
