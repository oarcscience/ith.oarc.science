<span id="iv.X.5-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.X.5-p1.1"></span>Chapter 5.—Of the Sacrifices Which God Does Not
Require, But Wished to Be Observed for the Exhibition of Those Things
Which He Does Require.</span>

<span id="iv.X.5-p2"></span>And who is so foolish as to suppose that the
things offered to God are needed by Him for some uses of His own? 
Divine Scripture in many places explodes this idea.  Not to be
wearisome, suffice it to quote this brief saying from a psalm:  “I have
said to the Lord, Thou art my God:  for Thou needest not my
goodness.” <span id="fr_381"></span>[382](#fn_381.md)   We must believe,
then, that God has no need, not only of cattle, or any other earthly and
material thing, but even of man’s righteousness, and that whatever right
worship is paid to God profits not Him, but man.  For no man would say
he did a benefit to a fountain by drinking, or to the light by seeing. 
And the fact that the ancient church offered animal sacrifices, which
the people of God now-a-days read of without imitating, proves nothing
else than this, that those sacrifices signified the things which we do
for the purpose of drawing near to God, and inducing our neighbor to do
the same.  A sacrifice, therefore, is the visible sacrament or sacred
sign of an invisible sacrifice.  Hence that penitent in the psalm, or it
may be the Psalmist himself, entreating God to be merciful to his sins,
says, “If Thou desiredst sacrifice, I would give it:  Thou delightest
not in whole burnt-offerings.  The sacrifice of God is a broken heart: 
a heart contrite and humble God will not despise.” <span
id="fr_382"></span>[383](#fn_382.md)   Observe how, in the very words in
which he is expressing God’s refusal of sacrifice, he shows that God
requires sacrifice.  He does not desire the sacrifice of a slaughtered
beast, but He desires the sacrifice of a contrite heart.  Thus, that
sacrifice which he says God does not wish, is the symbol of the
sacrifice which God does wish.  God does not wish sacrifices in the
sense in which foolish people think He wishes them, viz., to gratify His
own pleasure.  For if He had not wished that the sacrifices He requires,
as, *e.g*., a heart contrite and humbled by penitent sorrow, should be
symbolized by those sacrifices which He was thought to desire because
pleasant to Himself, the old law would never have enjoined their
presentation; and they were destined to be merged when the fit
opportunity arrived, in order that men might not suppose that the
sacrifices themselves, rather than the things symbolized by them, were
pleasing to God or acceptable in us.  Hence, in another passage from
another psalm, he says, “If I were hungry, I would not tell thee; for
the world is mine and the fullness thereof.  Will I eat the flesh of
bulls, or drink the blood of goats?” <span
id="fr_383"></span>[384](#fn_383.md) as if He should say, Supposing such
things were necessary to me, I would never ask thee for what I have in
my own hand.  Then he goes on to mention what these signify:  “Offer
unto God the sacrifice of praise, and pay thy vows unto the Most High. 
And call upon me in the day of trouble:  I will deliver thee, and thou
shall glorify me.” <span id="fr_384"></span>[385](#fn_384.md)   So in
another prophet:  “Wherewith shall I come before the Lord, and bow
myself before the High God?  Shall I come before Him with
burnt-offerings, with calves of a year old?  Will the Lord be pleased
with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands of rivers of oil?  Shall I
give my first-born for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the
sin of my soul?  Hath He showed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth
the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to
walk humbly with thy God?” <span id="fr_385"></span>[386](#fn_385.md)   In
the words of this prophet, these two things are distinguished and set
forth with sufficient explicitness, that God does not require these
sacrifices for their own sakes, and that He does require the sacrifices
which they symbolize.  In the epistle entitled “To the Hebrews” it is
said, “To do good and to communicate, forget not:  for with such
sacrifices God is well pleased.” <span id="fr_386"></span>[387](#fn_386.md)
  And so, when it is written, “I desire mercy rather than
sacrifice,” <span id="fr_387"></span>[388](#fn_387.md) nothing else is
meant than that one sacrifice is preferred to another; for that which in
common speech is called sacrifice is only the symbol of the true
sacrifice.  Now mercy is the true sacrifice, and therefore it is said,
as I have just quoted, “with such sacrifices God is well pleased.”  All
the divine ordinances, therefore, which we read concerning the
sacrifices in the service of the tabernacle or the temple, we are to
refer to the love of God and our neighbor.  For “on these two
commandments,” as it is written, “hang all the law and the
prophets.” <span id="fr_388"></span>[389](#fn_388.md)
