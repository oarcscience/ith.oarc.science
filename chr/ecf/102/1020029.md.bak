id="iv.ii.xxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 23.—What We are to Think of the
Example of Cato, Who Slew Himself Because Unable to Endure Cæsar’s
Victory.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.xxiv-p2"></span>Besides Lucretia, of whom enough has
already been said, our advocates of suicide have some difficulty in
finding any other prescriptive example, unless it be that of Cato, who
killed himself at Utica.  His example is appealed to, not because he was
the only man who did so, but because he was so esteemed as a learned and
excellent man, that it could plausibly be maintained that what he did
was and is a good thing to do.  But of this action of his, what can I
say but that his own friends, enlightened men as he, prudently dissuaded
him, and therefore judged his act to be that of a feeble rather than a
strong spirit, and dictated not by honorable feeling forestalling shame,
but by weakness shrinking from hardships?  Indeed, Cato condemns himself
by the advice he gave to his dearly loved son.  For if it was a disgrace
to live under Cæsar’s rule, why did the father urge the son to this
disgrace, by encouraging him to trust absolutely to Cæsar’s generosity? 
Why did he not persuade him to die along with himself?  If Torquatus was
applauded for putting his son to death, when contrary to orders he had
engaged, and engaged successfully, with the enemy, why did conquered
Cato spare his conquered son, though he did not spare himself?  Was it
more disgraceful to be a victor contrary to orders, than to submit to a
victor contrary to the received ideas of honor?  Cato, then, cannot have
deemed it to be shameful to live under Cæsar’s rule; for had he done so,
the father’s sword would have delivered his son from this disgrace.  The
truth is, that his son, whom he both hoped and desired would be spared
by Cæsar, was not more loved by him than Cæsar was envied the glory of
pardoning him (as indeed Cæsar himself is reported to have said <span
id="fr_78"></span>[79](#fn_78) .md); or if envy is too strong a word, let
us say he was *ashamed* that this glory should be his.
