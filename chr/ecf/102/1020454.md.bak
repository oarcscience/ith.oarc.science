<span id="iv.XVI.5-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XVI.5-p1.1"></span>Chapter 5.—Of God’s Coming Down to Confound
the Languages of the Builders of the City.</span>

<span id="iv.XVI.5-p2"></span>We read, “The Lord came down to see the
city and the tower which the sons of men built:”  it was not the sons of
God, but that society which lived in a merely human way, and which we
call the earthly city.  God, who is always wholly everywhere, does not
move locally; but He is said to descend when He does anything in the
earth out of the usual course, which, as it were, makes His presence
felt.  And in the same way, He does not by “seeing” learn some new
thing, for He cannot ever be ignorant of anything; but He is said to see
and recognize, in time, that which He causes others to see and
recognize.  And therefore that city was not previously being seen as God
made it be seen when He showed how offensive it was to Him.  We might,
indeed, interpret God’s descending to the city of the descent of His
angels in whom He dwells; so that the following words, “And the Lord God
said, Behold, they are all one race and of one language,” and also what
follows, “Come, and let us go down and confound their speech,” are a
recapitulation, explaining how the previously intimated “descent of the
Lord” was accomplished.  For if He had already gone down, why does He
say, “Come, and let us go down and confound?”—words which seem to be
addressed to the angels, and to intimate that He who was in the angels
descended in their descent.  And the words most appropriately are, not,
“Go ye down and confound,” but, “Let us confound their speech;” showing
that He so works by His servants, that they are themselves also
fellow-laborers with God, as the apostle says, “For we are
fellow-laborers with God.” <span id="fr_876"></span>[877](#fn_876.md)
