<span id="iv.VII.4-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.VII.4-p1.1"></span>Chapter 4.—The Inferior Gods, Whose Names are
Not Associated with Infamy, Have Been Better Dealt with Than the Select
Gods, Whose Infamies are Celebrated.</span>

<span id="iv.VII.4-p2"></span>However, any one who eagerly seeks for
celebrity and renown, might congratulate those select gods, and call
them fortunate, were it not that he saw that they have been selected
more to their injury than to their honor.  For that low crowd of gods
have been protected by their very meanness and obscurity from being
overwhelmed with infamy.  We laugh, indeed, when we see them distributed
by the mere fiction of human opinions, according to the special works
assigned to them, like those who farm small portions of the public
revenue, or like workmen in the street of the silversmiths, <span
id="fr_258"></span>[259](#fn_258.md) where one vessel, in order that it may
go out perfect, passes through the hands of many, when it might have
been finished by one perfect workman.  But the only reason why the
combined skill of many workmen was thought necessary, was, that it is
better that each part of an art should be learned by a special workman,
which can be done speedily and easily, than that they should all be
compelled to be perfect in one art throughout all its parts, which they
could only attain slowly and with difficulty.  Nevertheless there is
scarcely to be found one of the non-select gods who has brought infamy
on himself by any crime, whilst there is scarce any one of the select
gods who has not received upon himself the brand of notable infamy. 
These latter have descended to the humble works of the others, whilst
the others have not come up to their sublime crimes.  Concerning Janus,
there does not readily occur to my recollection anything infamous; and
perhaps he was such an one as lived more innocently than the rest, and
further removed from misdeeds and crimes.  He kindly received and
entertained Saturn when he was fleeing; he divided his kingdom with his
guest, so that each of them had a city for himself, <span
id="fr_259"></span>[260](#fn_259.md) the one Janiculum, and the other
Saturnia.  But those seekers after every kind of unseemliness in the
worship of the gods have disgraced him, whose life they found to be less
disgracful than that of the other gods, with an image of monstrous
deformity, making it sometimes with two faces, and sometimes, as it
were, double, with four faces. <span id="fr_260"></span>[261](#fn_260.md)  
Did they wish that, as the most of the select gods had lost shame <span
id="fr_261"></span>[262](#fn_261.md) through the perpetration of shameful
crimes, his greater innocence should be marked by a greater number of
faces? <span id="fr_262"></span>[263](#fn_262.md)
