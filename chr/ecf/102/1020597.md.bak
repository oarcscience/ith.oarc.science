<span id="iv.XIX.24-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XIX.24-p1.1"></span>Chapter 24.—The Definition Which Must Be
Given of a People and a Republic, in Order to Vindicate the Assumption
of These Titles by the Romans and by Other Kingdoms.</span>

<span id="iv.XIX.24-p2"></span>But if we discard this definition of a
people, and, assuming another, say that a people is an assemblage of
reasonable beings bound together by a common agreement as to the objects
of their love, then, in order to discover the character of any people,
we have only to observe what they love.  Yet whatever it loves, if only
it is an assemblage of reasonable beings and not of beasts, and is bound
together by an agreement as to the objects of love, it is reasonably
called a people; and it will be a superior people in proportion as it is
bound together by higher interests, inferior in proportion as it is
bound together by lower.  According to this definition of ours, the
Roman people is a people, and its weal is without doubt a commonwealth
or republic.  But what its tastes were in its early and subsequent days,
and how it declined into sanguinary seditions and then to social and
civil wars, and so burst asunder or rotted off the bond of concord in
which the health of a people consists, history shows, and in the
preceding books I have related at large.  And yet I would not on this
account say either that it was not a people, or that its administration
was not a republic, so long as there remains an assemblage of reasonable
beings bound together by a common agreement as to the objects of love. 
But what I say of this people and of this republic I must be understood
to think and say of the Athenians or any Greek state, of the Egyptians,
of the early Assyrian Babylon, and of every other nation, great or
small, which had a public government.  For, in general, the city of the
ungodly, which did not obey the command of God that it should offer no
sacrifice save to Him alone, and which, therefore, could not give to the
soul its proper command over the body, nor to the reason its just
authority over the vices, is void of true justice.
