in Egypt.</span>

<span id="iv.XVIII.7-p2"></span>In the reign of Mamitus, the twelfth
king of Assyria, and Plemnæus, the eleventh of Sicyon, while Argus still
reigned over the Argives, Joseph died in Egypt a hundred and ten years
old.  After his death, the people of God, increasing wonderfully,
remained in Egypt a hundred and forty-five years, in tranquillity at
first, until those who knew Joseph were dead.  Afterward, through envy
of their increase, and the suspicion that they would at length gain
their freedom, they were oppressed with persecutions and the labors of
intolerable servitude, amid which, however, they still grew, being
multiplied with God-given fertility.  During this period the same
kingdoms continued in Assyria and Greece.
