id="v.vi.xxxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 31.—The First Rule of
Tichonius.</span>

<span id="v.vi.xxxi-p2"></span>44.  The first is about *the Lord and His
body*, and it is this, that, knowing as we do that the head and the
body—that is, Christ and His Church—are sometimes indicated to us under
one person (for it is not in vain that it is said to believers, “Ye then
are Abraham’s seed,” <span id="fr_1897"></span>[1898](#fn_1897.md) when
there is but one seed of Abraham, and that is Christ), we need not be in
a difficulty when a transition is made from the head to the body or from
the body to the head, and yet no change made in the person spoken of. 
For a single person is represented as saying, “He hath decked me as a
bridegroom with ornaments, and adorned me as a bride with jewels” <span
id="fr_1898"></span>[1899](#fn_1898.md) and yet it is, of course, a matter
for <span id="page_569">p. 569</span> <span
id="v.vi.xxxi-Page_569"></span> interpretation which of these two refers
to the head and which to the body, that is, which to Christ and which to
the Church.
