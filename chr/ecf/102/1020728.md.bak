id="v.iv.xxxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 32.—In What Way God Uses Man.</span>

<span id="v.iv.xxxii-p2"></span>35.  But neither does He use after our
fashion of using.  For when we use objects, we do so with a view to the
full enjoyment of the goodness of God.  God, however, in His use of us,
has reference to His own goodness.  For it is because He is good we
exist; and so far as we truly exist we are good.  And, further, because
He is also just, we cannot with impunity be evil; and so far as we are
evil, so far is our existence less complete.  Now He is the first and
supreme existence, who is altogether unchangeable, and who could say in
the fullest sense of the words, “I AM <span class="c20"><span
id="v.iv.xxxii-p2.1"></span>That</span> I AM,” and “Thou shalt say to
them, I AM hath sent me unto you;” <span
id="fr_1743"></span>[1744](#fn_1743.md) so that all other things that
exist, both owe their existence entirely to Him, and are good only so
far as He has given it to them to be so.  That use, then, which God is
said to make of us has no reference to His own advantage, but to ours
only; and, so far as He is concerned, has reference only to His
goodness. <span id="page_532">p. 532</span> <span
id="v.iv.xxxii-Page_532"></span> When we take pity upon a man and care
for him, it is for his advantage we do so; but somehow or other our own
advantage follows by a sort of natural consequence, for God does not
leave the mercy we show to him who needs it to go without reward.  Now
this is our highest reward, that we should fully enjoy Him, and that all
who enjoy Him should enjoy one another in Him.
