<span id="iv.VIII.1-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.VIII.1-p1.1"></span>Chapter 1.—That the Question of Natural
Theology is to Be Discussed with Those Philosophers Who Sought a More
Excellent Wisdom.</span>

<span id="iv.VIII.1-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.VIII.1-p2.1"></span>We</span> shall require to apply our mind
with far greater intensity to the present question than was requisite in
the solution and unfolding of the questions handled in the preceding
books; for it is not with ordinary men, but with philosophers that we
must confer concerning the theology which they call natural.  For it is
not like the fabulous, that is, the theatrical; nor the civil, that is,
the urban theology:  the one of which displays the crimes of the gods,
whilst the other manifests their criminal desires, which demonstrate
them to be rather malign demons than gods.  It is, we say, with
philosophers we have to confer with respect to this theology,—men whose
very name, if rendered into Latin, signifies those who profess the love
of wisdom.  Now, if wisdom is God, who made all things, as is attested
by the divine authority and truth, <span
id="fr_295"></span>[296](#fn_295.md) then the philosopher is a lover of
God.  But since the thing itself, which is called by this name, exists
not in all who glory in the name,—for it does not follow, of course,
that all who are called philosophers are lovers of true wisdom,—we must
needs select from the number of those with whose opinions we have been
able to acquaint ourselves by reading, some with whom we may not
unworthily engage in the treatment of this question.  For I have not in
this work undertaken to refute all the vain opinions of the
philosophers, but only such as pertain to theology, which Greek word we
understand to mean an account or explanation of the divine nature.  Nor,
again, have I undertaken to refute all the vain theological opinions of
all the philosophers, but only of such of them as, agreeing in the
belief that there is a divine nature, and that this divine nature is
concerned about human affairs, do nevertheless deny that the worship of
the one unchangeable God is sufficient for the obtaining of a blessed
life after death, as well as at the present time; and hold that, in
order to obtain that life, many gods, created, indeed, and appointed to
their several spheres by that one God, are to be worshipped.  These
approach nearer to the truth than even Varro; for, whilst he saw no
difficulty in extending natural theology in its entirety even to the
world and the soul of the world, these acknowledge God as existing above
all that is of the nature of soul, and as the Creator not only of this
visible world, which is often called heaven and earth, but also of every
soul whatsoever, and as Him who gives blessedness to the rational
soul,—of which kind is the human soul,—by participation in His own
unchangeable and incorporeal light.  There is no one, who has even a
slender knowledge of these things, who does not know of the Platonic
<span id="page_145">p. 145</span> <span id="iv.VIII.1-Page_145"></span>
philosophers, who derive their name from their master Plato.  Concerning
this Plato, then, I will briefly state such things as I deem necessary
to the present question, mentioning beforehand those who preceded him in
time in the same department of literature.
