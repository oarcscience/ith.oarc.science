<span id="iv.XIX.6-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XIX.6-p1.1"></span>Chapter 6.—Of the Error of Human Judgments
When the Truth is Hidden.</span>

<span id="iv.XIX.6-p2"></span>What shall I say of these judgments which
men pronounce on men, and which are necessary in communities, whatever
outward peace they enjoy?  Melancholy and lamentable judgments they are,
since the judges are men who cannot discern the consciences of those at
their bar, and are therefore frequently compelled to put innocent
witnesses to the torture to ascertain the truth regarding the crimes of
other men.  What shall I say of torture applied to the accused himself? 
He is tortured to discover whether he is guilty, so that, though
innocent, he suffers most undoubted punishment for crime that is still
doubtful, not because it is proved that he committed it, but because it
is not ascertained that he did not commit it.  Thus the ignorance of the
judge frequently involves an innocent person in suffering.  And what is
still more unendurable—a thing, indeed, to be bewailed, and, if that
were possible, watered with fountains of tears—is this, that when the
judge puts the accused to the question, that he may not unwittingly put
an innocent man to death, the result of this lamentable ignorance is
that this very person, whom he tortured that he might not condemn him if
innocent, is condemned to death both tortured and innocent.  For if he
has chosen, in obedience to the philosophical instructions to the wise
man, to quit this life rather than endure any longer such tortures, he
declares that he has committed the crime which in fact he has not
committed.  And when he has been condemned and put to death, the judge
is still in ignorance whether he has put to death an innocent or a
guilty person, though he put the accused to the torture for the very
purpose of saving himself from condemning the innocent; and consequently
he has both tortured an innocent man to discover his innocence, and has
put him to death without discovering it.  If such darkness shrouds
social life, will a wise judge take his seat on the bench or no?  Beyond
question he will.  For human society, which he thinks it a wickedness to
abandon, constrains him and compels him to this duty.  And he thinks it
no wickedness that innocent witnesses are tortured regarding the crimes
of which other men are accused; or that the accused are put to the
torture, so that they are often overcome with anguish, and, though
innocent, make false confessions regarding themselves, and are punished;
or that, though they be not condemned to die, they often die during, or
in consequence of, the torture; or that sometimes the accusers, who
perhaps have been prompted <span id="page_405">p. 405</span> <span
id="iv.XIX.6-Page_405"></span> by a desire to benefit society by
bringing criminals to justice, are themselves condemned through the
ignorance of the judge, because they are unable to prove the truth of
their accusations though they are true, and because the witnesses lie,
and the accused endures the torture without being moved to confession. 
These numerous and important evils he does not consider sins; for the
wise judge does these things, not with any intention of doing harm, but
because his ignorance compels him, and because human society claims him
as a judge.  But though we therefore acquit the judge of malice, we must
none the less condemn human life as miserable.  And if he is compelled
to torture and punish the innocent because his office and his ignorance
constrain him, is he a happy as well as a guiltless man?  Surely it were
proof of more profound considerateness and finer feeling were he to
recognize the misery of these necessities, and shrink from his own
implication in that misery; and had he any piety about him, he would cry
to God “From my necessities deliver Thou me.” <span
