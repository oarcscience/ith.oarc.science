enforcing what is good, should not despise any of those three objects,
either to teach, or to give pleasure, or to move, and should pray and
strive, as we have said above, to be heard with intelligence, with
pleasure, and with ready compliance.  And when he does this with
elegance and propriety, he may justly be called eloquent, even though he
do not carry with him the assent of his hearer.  For it is these three
ends, viz., teaching, giving pleasure, and moving, that the great master
of Roman eloquence himself seems to have intended that the following
three directions should subserve:  “He, then, shall be eloquent, who can
say little things in a subdued style, moderate things in a temperate
style, and great things in a majestic style:” <span

three ends mentioned above, and had embraced the whole in one sentence
thus:  “He, then, shall be eloquent, who can say little things in a
subdued style, in order to give instruction, moderate things in a
temperate style, in order to give pleasure, and great things in a
majestic style, in order to sway the mind.”
