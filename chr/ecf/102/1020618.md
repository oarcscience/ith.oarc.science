<span id="iv.XX.16-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XX.16-p1.1"></span>Chapter 16.—Of the New Heaven and the New
Earth.</span>

<span id="iv.XX.16-p2"></span>Having finished the prophecy of judgment,
so far as the wicked are concerned, it remains that he speak also of the
good.  Having briefly explained the Lord’s words, “These will go away
into everlasting punishment,” it remains that he explain the connected
words, “but the righteous into life eternal.” <span
id="fr_1387"></span>[1388](#fn_1387)   “And I saw,” he says, “a new
heaven and a new earth:  for the first heaven and the first earth have
passed away; and there is no more sea.” <span
id="fr_1388"></span>[1389](#fn_1388)   This will take place in the order
which he has by anticipation declared in the words, “I saw One sitting
on the throne, from whose face heaven and earth fled.”  For as soon as
those who are not written in the book of life have been judged and cast
into eternal fire,—the nature of which fire, or its position in the
world or universe, I suppose is known to no man, unless perhaps the
divine Spirit reveal it to some one,—then shall the figure of this world
pass away in a conflagration of universal fire, as once before the world
was flooded with a deluge of universal water.  And by this universal
conflagration the qualities of the corruptible elements which suited our
corruptible bodies shall utterly perish, and our substance shall receive
such qualities as shall, by a wonderful transmutation, harmonize with
our immortal bodies, so that, as the world itself is renewed to some
better thing, it is fitly accommodated to men, themselves renewed in
their flesh to some better thing.  As for the statement, “And there
shall be no more sea,” I would not lightly say whether it is dried up
with that excessive heat, or is itself also turned into <span
id="page_436">p. 436</span> <span id="iv.XX.16-Page_436"></span> some
better thing.  For we read that there shall be a new heaven and a new
earth, but I do not remember to have anywhere read anything of a new
sea, unless what I find in this same book, “As it were a sea of glass
like crystal.” <span id="fr_1389"></span>[1390](#fn_1389)   But he was
not then speaking of this end of the world, neither does he seem to
speak of a literal sea, but “as it were a sea.”  It is possible that, as
prophetic diction delights in mingling figurative and real language, and
thus in some sort veiling the sense, so the words “And there is no more
sea” may be taken in the same sense as the previous phrase, “And the sea
presented the dead which were in it.”  For then there shall be no more
of this world, no more of the surgings and restlessness of human life,
and it is this which is symbolized by the sea.
