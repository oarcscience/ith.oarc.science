<span id="iv.XVII.24-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XVII.24-p1.1"></span>Chapter 24.—Of the Prophets, Who Either Were
the Last Among the Jews, or Whom the Gospel History Reports About the
Time of Christ’s Nativity.</span>

<span id="iv.XVII.24-p2"></span>But in that whole time after they
returned from Babylon, after Malachi, Haggai, and Zechariah, who then
prophesied, and Ezra, they had no prophets down to the time of the
Saviour’s advent except another Zechariah, the father of John, and
Elisabeth his wife, when the nativity of Christ was already close at
hand; and when He was already born, Simeon the aged, and Anna a widow,
and now very old; and, last of all, John himself, who, being a young
man, did not predict that Christ, now a young man, was to come, but by
prophetic knowledge pointed Him out though unknown; for which reason the
Lord Himself says, “The law and the prophets were until John.” <span
id="fr_1132"></span>[1133](#fn_1132.md)   But the prophesying of these five
is made known to us in the gospel, where the virgin mother of our Lord
herself is also found to have prophesied before John.  But this prophecy
of theirs the wicked Jews do not receive; but those innumerable persons
received it who from them believed the gospel.  For then truly Israel
was divided in two, by that division which was foretold by Samuel the
prophet to king Saul as immutable.  But even the reprobate Jews hold
Malachi, Haggai, Zechariah, and Ezra as the last received into canonical
authority.  For there are also writings of these, as of others, who
being but a very few in the great multitude of prophets, have written
those books which have obtained canonical authority, of whose
predictions it seems good to me to put in this work some which pertain
to Christ and His Church; and this, by the Lord’s help, shall be done
more conveniently in the following book, that we may not further burden
this one, which is already too long.
