<span id="iv.III.9-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.III.9-p1.1"></span>Chapter 9.—Whether It is Credible that the
Peace During the Reign of Numa Was Brought About by the Gods.</span>

<span id="iv.III.9-p2"></span>It is also believed that it was by the
help of the gods that the successor of Romulus, Numa Pompilius, enjoyed
peace during his entire reign, and shut the gates of Janus, which are
customarily kept open <span id="fr_130"></span>[131](#fn_130.md) during
war.  And it is supposed he was thus requited for appointing many
religious observances among the Romans.  Certainly that king would have
commanded our congratulations for so rare a leisure, had he been wise
enough to spend it on wholesome pursuits, and, subduing a pernicious
curiosity, had sought out the true God with true piety.  But as it was,
the gods were not the authors of his leisure; but possibly they would
have deceived him less had they found him busier.  For the more
disengaged they found him, the more they themselves occupied his
attention.  Varro informs us of all his efforts, and of the arts he
employed to associate these gods with himself and the city; and in its
own place, if God will, I shall discuss these matters.  Meanwhile, as we
are speaking of the benefits conferred by the gods, I readily admit that
peace is a great benefit; but it is a benefit of the true God, which,
like the sun, the rain, and other supports of life, is frequently
conferred on the ungrateful and wicked.  But if this great boon was
conferred on Rome and Pompilius by their gods, why did they never
afterwards grant it to the Roman empire during even more meritorious
periods?  Were the sacred rites more efficient at their first
institution than during their subsequent celebration?  But they had no
existence in Numa’s time, until he added them to the ritual; whereas
afterwards they had already been celebrated and preserved, that benefit
might arise from them.  How, then, is it that those forty-three, or as
others prefer it, thirty-nine years of Numa’s reign, were passed in
unbroken peace, and yet that afterwards, when the worship was
established, and the gods themselves, who were invoked by it, were the
recognized guardians and pa <span id="page_47">p. 47</span> <span
id="iv.III.9-Page_47"></span> trons of the city, we can with difficulty
find during the whole period, from the building of the city to the reign
of Augustus, one year—that, viz., which followed the close of the first
Punic war—in which, for a marvel, the Romans were able to shut the gates
of war? <span id="fr_131"></span>[132](#fn_131.md)

<span id="iv.III.9-p3"></span> The gates of Janus were not the gates of
a temple, but the gates of a passage called Janus, which was used only
for military purposes; shut therefore in peace, open in war.
