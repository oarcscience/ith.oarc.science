<span id="iv.ii.xv-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.ii.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 14.—Of the Captivity of the Saints,
and that Divine Consolation Never Failed Them Therein.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.xv-p2"></span>But, say they, many Christians were even
led away captive.  This indeed were a most pitiable fate, if they could
be led away to any place where they could not find their God.  But for
this calamity also sacred Scripture affords great consolation.  The
three youths <span id="fr_72"></span>[73](#fn_72.md) were captives; Daniel
was a captive; so were other prophets:  and God, the comforter, did not
fail them.  And in like manner He has not failed His own people in the
power of a nation which, though barbarous, is yet human,—He who did not
abandon the prophet <span id="fr_73"></span>[74](#fn_73.md) in the belly of
a monster.  These things, indeed, are turned to ridicule rather than
credited by those with whom we are debating; though they believe what
they read in their own books, that Arion of Methymna, the famous
lyrist, <span id="fr_74"></span>[75](#fn_74.md) when he was thrown
overboard, was received on a dolphin’s back and carried to land.  But
that story of ours about the prophet Jonah is far more incredible,—more
incredible because more marvellous, and more marvellous because a
greater exhibition of power.
