<span id="v.i-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="v.i-p1.1"></span>Introductory Note by the Editor.</span>

<span id="v.i-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="v.i-p2.1"></span>The</span> four books of St. Augustin *On Christian
Doctrine (De Doctrina Christiana, iv libri)* are a compend of exegetical
theology to guide the reader in the understanding and interpretation of
the Sacred Scriptures, according to the analogy of faith.  The first
three books were written <span class="c20"><span
id="v.i-p2.2"></span>a.d.</span> 397; the fourth was added 426.

<span id="v.i-p3"></span>He speaks of it in his *Retractations*, Bk.
*ii*., chap. 4, as follows:

<span id="v.i-p4"></span>“Finding that the books on Christian Doctrine
were not finished, I thought it better to complete them before passing
on to the revision of others.  Accordingly, I completed the third book,
which had been written as far as the place where a quotation is made
from the Gospel about the woman who took leaven and hid it in three
measures of meal till the whole was leavened. <span
id="fr_1701"></span>[1702](#fn_1701)   I added also the last book, and
finished the whole work in four books \[in the year 426\]:  the first
three affording aids to the interpretation of Scripture, the last giving
directions as to the mode of making known our interpretation.  In the
second book, <span id="fr_1702"></span>[1703](#fn_1702) I made a mistake
as to the authorship of the book commonly called the Wisdom of Solomon. 
For I have since learnt that it is not a well-established fact, as I
said it was, that Jesus the son of Sirach, who wrote the book of
Ecclesiasticus, wrote this book also:  on the contrary, I have
ascertained that it is altogether more probable that he was not the
author of this book.  Again, when I said, ‘The authority of the Old
Testament is contained within the limits of these forty-four
books,’ <span id="fr_1703"></span>[1704](#fn_1703) I used the phrase
‘Old Testament’ in accordance with ecclesiastical usage.  But the
apostle seems to restrict the application of the name ‘Old Testament’ to
the law which was given on Mount Sinai. <span
id="fr_1704"></span>[1705](#fn_1704)   And in what I said as to St.
Ambrose having, by his knowledge of chronology, solved a great
difficulty, when he showed that Plato and Jeremiah were
contemporaries, <span id="fr_1705"></span>[1706](#fn_1705) my memory
betrayed me.  What that great bishop really did say upon this subject
may be seen in the book which he wrote, ‘On Sacraments or
Philosophy.’” <span id="fr_1706"></span>[1707](#fn_1706)
