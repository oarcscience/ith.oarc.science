<span id="iv.XVIII.50-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XVIII.50-p1.1"></span>Chapter 50.—Of the Preaching of the Gospel,
Which is Made More Famous and Powerful by the Sufferings of Its
Preachers.</span>

<span id="iv.XVIII.50-p2"></span>Then was fulfilled that prophecy, “Out
of Sion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord out of
Jerusalem;” <span id="fr_1239"></span>[1240](#fn_1239) and the
prediction of the Lord Christ Himself, when, after the resurrection, “He
opened the understanding” of His amazed disciples “that they might
understand the Scriptures, and said unto them, that thus it is written,
and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the
third day, and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached
in His name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.” <span
id="fr_1240"></span>[1241](#fn_1240)   And again, when, in reply to
their questioning about the day of His last coming, He said, “It is not
for you to know the times or the seasons which the Father hath put in
His own power; but ye shall receive the power of the Holy Ghost coming
upon you, and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in
all Judea, and Samaria, and even unto the ends of the earth.” <span
id="fr_1241"></span>[1242](#fn_1241)   First of all, the Church spread
herself abroad from Jerusalem; and when very many in Judea and Samaria
had believed, she also went into other nations by those who announced
the gospel, whom, as lights, He Himself had both prepared by His word
and kindled by His Holy Spirit.  For He had said to them, “Fear ye not
them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul.” <span
id="fr_1242"></span>[1243](#fn_1242)   And that they might not be frozen
with fear, they burned with the fire of charity.  Finally, the gospel of
Christ was preached in the whole world, not only by those who had seen
and heard Him both before His passion and after His resurrection, but
also after their death by their successors, amid the horrible
persecutions, diverse torments and deaths of the martyrs, God also
bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and divers miracles
and gifts of the Holy Ghost, <span id="fr_1243"></span>[1244](#fn_1243)
that the people of the nations, believing in Him who was crucified for
their redemption, might venerate with Christian love the blood of the
martyrs which they had poured forth with devilish fury, and the very
kings by whose laws the Church had been laid waste might become
profitably subject to that name they had cruelly striven to take away
from the earth, and might begin to <span id="page_392">p. 392</span>
<span id="iv.XVIII.50-Page_392"></span> persecute the false gods for
whose sake the worshippers of the true God had formerly been persecuted.
