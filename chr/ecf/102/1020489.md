<span id="iv.XVI.40-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XVI.40-p1.1"></span>Chapter 40.—How It is Said that Jacob Went
into Egypt with Seventy-Five Souls, When Most of Those Who are Mentioned
Were Born at a Later Period.</span>

<span id="iv.XVI.40-p2"></span>Seventy-five men are reported to have
entered Egypt along with Jacob, counting him with his children.  In this
number only two women are mentioned, one a daughter, the other a
grand-daughter.  But when the thing is carefully considered, it does not
appear that Jacob’s offspring was so numerous on the day or year when he
entered Egypt.  There are also included among them the
great-grandchildren of Joseph, who could not possibly be born already. 
For Jacob was then 130 years old, and his son Joseph thirty-nine and as
it is plain that he took a wife when he was thirty or more, how could he
in nine years have great-grandchildren by the children whom he had by
that wife?  Now since, Ephraim and Manasseh, the sons of Joseph, could
not even have children, for Jacob found them boys under nine years old
when he entered Egypt, in what way are not only their sons but their
grandsons reckoned among those seventy-five who then entered Egypt with
Jacob?  For there is reckoned there Machir the son of Manasseh, grandson
of Joseph, and Machir’s son, that is, Gilead, grandson of Manasseh,
great-grandson of Joseph; there, too, is he whom Ephraim, Joseph’s other
son, begot, that is, Shuthelah, grandson of Joseph, and Shuthelah’s son
Ezer, grandson of Ephraim, and great-grand-son of Joseph, who could not
possibly be in existence when Jacob came into Egypt, and there found his
grandsons, the sons of Joseph, their grandsires, still boys under nine
years of age. <span id="fr_966"></span>[967](#fn_966.md)   But doubtless,
when the Scripture mentions Jacob’s entrance into Egypt with
seventy-five souls, it does not mean one day, or one year, but that
whole time as long as Joseph lived, who was the cause of his entrance. 
For the same Scripture speaks thus of Joseph:  “And Joseph dwelt in
Egypt, he and his brethren, and all his father’s house:  and Joseph
lived 110 years, and saw Ephraim’s children of the third
generation.” <span id="fr_967"></span>[968](#fn_967.md)   That is, his
great-grandson, the third from Ephraim; for the third generation means
son, grandson, great-grandson.  Then it is added, “The children also of
Machir, the son of Manasseh, were born upon Joseph’s knees.” <span
id="fr_968"></span>[969](#fn_968.md)   And this is that grandson of
Manasseh, and great-grandson of Joseph.  But the plural number is
employed according to scriptural usage; for the one daughter of Jacob is
spoken of as daughters, just as in the usage of the Latin tongue
*liberi* is used in the plural for children even when there is only
one.  Now, when Joseph’s own happiness is proclaimed, because he could
see his great-grandchildren, it is by no means to be thought they
already existed in the thirty-ninth year of their great-grandsire
Joseph, when his father Jacob came to him in Egypt.  But those who
diligently look into these things will the less easily be mistaken,
because it is written, “These are the names of the sons of Israel who
entered into Egypt along with Jacob their father.” <span
id="fr_969"></span>[970](#fn_969.md)   For this means that the seventy-five
are reckoned along with him, not that they were all with him when he
entered Egypt; for, as I have said, the whole period during which
Joseph, who occasioned his entrance, lived, is held to be the time of
that entrance.
