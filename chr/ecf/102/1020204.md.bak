id="iv.VII.21-p1.1"></span>Chapter 21.—Concerning the Shamefulness of
the Rites Which are Celebrated in Honor of Liber.</span>

<span id="iv.VII.21-p2"></span>Now as to the rites of Liber, whom they
have set over liquid seeds, and therefore not only over the liquors of
fruits, among which wine holds, so to speak, the primacy, but also over
the seeds of animals:—as to these rites, I am unwilling to undertake to
show to what excess of turpitude they had reached, because that would
entail a lengthened discourse, though I am not unwilling to do so as a
demonstration of the proud stupidity of those who practise them.  Among
other rites which I am compelled from the greatness of their number to
omit, Varro says that in Italy, at the places where roads crossed each
other the rites of Liber were celebrated with such unrestrained
turpitude, that the private parts of a man were worshipped in his
honor.  Nor was this abomination transacted in secret that some regard
at least might be paid to modesty, but was openly and wantonly
displayed.  For during the festival of Liber this obscene member, placed
on a car, was carried with great honor, first over the crossroads in the
country, and then into the city.  But in the town of Lavinium a whole
month was devoted to Liber alone, during the days of which all the
people gave themselves up to the must dissolute conversation, until that
member had been carried through the forum and brought to rest in its own
place; on which unseemly member it was necessary that the most honorable
matron should place a wreath in the presence of all the people.  Thus,
forsooth, was the god Liber to be appeased in order to the growth of
seeds.  Thus was enchantment to be driven away from fields, even by a
matron’s being compelled to do in public what not even a harlot ought to
be permitted to do in a theatre, if there were matrons among the
spectators.  For these reasons, then, Saturn alone was not believed to
be sufficient for seeds,—namely, that the impure mind might find
occasions for multiplying the gods; and that, being righteously
abandoned to uncleanness by the one true God, and being prostituted to
the worship of many false gods, through an avidity for ever greater and
greater uncleanness, it should call these sacrilegious rites sacred
things, and should abandon itself to be violated and polluted by crowds
of foul demons.
