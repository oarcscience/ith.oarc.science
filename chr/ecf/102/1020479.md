id="iv.XVI.30-p1.1"></span>Chapter 30.—Of Lot’s Deliverance from Sodom,
and Its Consumption by Fire from Heaven; And of Abimelech, Whose Lust
Could Not Harm Sarah’s Chastity.</span>

<span id="iv.XVI.30-p2"></span>After this promise Lot was delivered out
of Sodom, and a fiery rain from heaven turned into ashes that whole
region of the impious city, where custom had made sodomy as prevalent as
laws have elsewhere made other kinds of wickedness.  But this punishment
of theirs was a specimen of the divine judgment to come.  For what is
meant by the angels forbidding those who were delivered to look back,
but that we are not to look back in heart to the old life which, being
regenerated through grace, we have put off, if we think to escape the
last judgment?  Lot’s wife, indeed, when she looked back, remained, and,
being turned into salt, furnished to believing men a condiment by which
to savor somewhat the warning to be drawn from that example.  Then
Abraham did again at Gerar, with Abimelech the king of that city, what
he had done in Egypt about his wife, and received her back untouched in
the same way.  On this occasion, when the king rebuked Abraham for not
saying she was his wife, and calling her his sister, he explained what
he had been afraid of, and added this further, “And yet indeed she is my
sister by the father’s side, but not by the mother’s; <span
id="fr_936"></span>[937](#fn_936) for she was Abraham’s sister by his
own father, and so near of kin.  But her beauty was so great, that even
at that advanced age she could be fallen in love with.
