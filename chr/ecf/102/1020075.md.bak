<span id="iv.III.2-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.III.2-p1.1"></span>Chapter 2.—Whether the Gods, Whom the Greeks
and Romans Worshipped in Common, Were Justified in Permitting the
Destruction of Ilium.</span>

<span id="iv.III.2-p2"></span>First, then, why was Troy or Ilium, the
cradle of the Roman people (for I must not overlook nor disguise what I
touched upon in the first book <span id="fr_120"></span>[121](#fn_120.md)
), conquered, taken and destroyed by the Greeks, though it esteemed and
worshipped the same gods as they?  Priam, some answer, paid the penalty
of the perjury of his father Laomedon. <span
id="fr_121"></span>[122](#fn_121.md)   Then it is true that Laomedon hired
Apollo and Neptune as his workmen.  For the story goes that he promised
them wages, and then broke his bargain.  I wonder that famous diviner
Apollo toiled at so huge a work, and never suspected Laomedon was going
to cheat him of his pay.  And Neptune too, his uncle, brother of
Jupiter, king of the sea, it really was not seemly that he should be
ignorant of what was to happen.  For he is introduced by Homer <span
id="fr_122"></span>[123](#fn_122.md) (who lived and wrote before the
building of Rome) as predicting something great of the posterity of
Æneas, who in fact founded Rome.  And as Homer says, Nep <span
id="page_44">p. 44</span> <span id="iv.III.2-Page_44"></span> tune also
rescued Æneas in a cloud from the wrath of Achilles, though (according
to Virgil <span id="fr_123"></span>[124](#fn_123) .md)

<span id="iv.III.2-p7"></span>“All his will was to destroy

<span id="iv.III.2-p8"></span>His own creation, perjured Troy.”

<span id="iv.III.2-p9"></span>Gods, then, so great as Apollo and
Neptune, in ignorance of the cheat that was to defraud them of their
wages, built the walls of Troy for nothing but thanks and thankless
people. <span id="fr_124"></span>[125](#fn_124.md)   There may be some
doubt whether it is not a worse crime to believe such persons to be
gods, than to cheat such gods.  Even Homer himself did not give full
credence to the story for while he represents Neptune, indeed, as
hostile to the Trojans, he introduces Apollo as their champion, though
the story implies that both were offended by that fraud.  If, therefore,
they believe their fables, let them blush to worship such gods; if they
discredit the fables, let no more be said of the “Trojan perjury;” or
let them explain how the gods hated Trojan, but loved Roman perjury. 
For how did the conspiracy of Catiline, even in so large and corrupt a
city, find so abundant a supply of men whose hands and tongues found
them a living by perjury and civic broils?  What else but perjury
corrupted the judgments pronounced by so many of the senators?  What
else corrupted the people’s votes and decisions of all causes tried
before them?  For it seems that the ancient practice of taking oaths has
been preserved even in the midst of the greatest corruption, not for the
sake of restraining wickedness by religious fear, but to complete the
tale of crimes by adding that of perjury.
