<span id="iv.XVI.35-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XVI.35-p1.1"></span>Chapter 35.—What Was Indicated by the Divine
Answer About the Twins Still Shut Up in the Womb of Rebecca Their
Mother.</span>

<span id="iv.XVI.35-p2"></span>Let us now see how the times of the city
of God run on from this point among Abraham’s descendants.  In the time
from the first year of Isaac’s life to the seventieth, when his sons
were born, the only memorable thing is, that when he prayed God that his
wife, who was barren, might bear, and the Lord granted what he sought,
and she conceived, the twins leapt while still enclosed in her womb. 
And when she was troubled by this struggle, and <span id="page_331">p.
331</span> <span id="iv.XVI.35-Page_331"></span> inquired of the Lord,
she received this answer:  “Two nations are in thy womb, and two manner
of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one people shall
overcome the other people, and the elder shall serve the younger.” <span
id="fr_952"></span>[953](#fn_952.md)   The Apostle Paul would have us
understand this as a great instance of grace; <span
id="fr_953"></span>[954](#fn_953.md) for the children being not yet born,
neither having done any good or evil, the younger is chosen without any
good desert and the elder is rejected, when beyond doubt, as regards
original sin, both were alike, and as regards actual sin, neither had
any.  But the plan of the work on hand does not permit me to speak more
fully of this matter now, and I have said much about it in other works. 
Only that saying, “The elder shall serve the younger,” is understood by
our writers, almost without exception, to mean that the elder people,
the Jews, shall serve the younger people, the Christians.  And truly,
although this might seem to be fulfilled in the Idumean nation, which
was born of the elder (who had two names, being called both Esau and
Edom, whence the name Idumeans), because it was afterwards to be
overcome by the people which sprang from the younger, that is, by the
Israelites, and was to become subject to them; yet it is more suitable
to believe that, when it was said, “The one people shall overcome the
other people, and the elder shall serve the younger,” that prophecy
meant some greater thing; and what is that except what is evidently
fulfilled in the Jews and Christians?
