<span id="iv.XXI.6-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XXI.6-p1.1"></span>Chapter 6.—That All Marvels are Not of
Nature’s Production, But that Some are Due to Human Ingenuity and Others
to Diabolic Contrivance.</span>

<span id="iv.XXI.6-p2"></span>At this point they will perhaps reply,
“These things have no existence; we don’t believe one of them; they are
travellers’ tales and fictitious romances;” and they may add what has
the appearance of argument, and say, “If you believe such things as
these, believe what is recorded in the same books, that there was or is
a temple of Venus in which a candelabrum set in the open air holds a
lamp, which burns so strongly that no storm <span id="page_457">p.
457</span> <span id="iv.XXI.6-Page_457"></span> or rain extinguishes it,
and which is therefore called, like the stone mentioned above, the
asbestos or inextinguishable lamp.”  They may say this with the
intention of putting us into a dilemma:  for if we say this is
incredible, then we shall impugn the truth of the other recorded
marvels; if, on the other hand, we admit that this is credible, we shall
avouch the pagan deities.  But, as I have already said in the eighteenth
book of this work, we do not hold it necessary to believe all that
profane history contains, since, as Varro says, even historians
themselves disagree on so many points, that one would think they
intended and were at pains to do so; but we believe, if we are disposed,
those things which are not contradicted by these books, which we do not
hesitate to say we are bound to believe.  But as to those permanent
miracles of nature, whereby we wish to persuade the sceptical of the
miracles of the world to come, those are quite sufficient for our
purpose which we ourselves can observe or of which it is not difficult
to find trustworthy witnesses.  Moreover, that temple of Venus, with its
inextinguishable lamp, so far from hemming us into a corner, opens an
advantageous field to our argument.  For to this inextinguishable lamp
we add a host of marvels wrought by men, or by magic,—that is, by men
under the influence of devils, or by the devils directly,—for such
marvels we cannot deny without impugning the truth of the sacred
Scriptures we believe.  That lamp, therefore, was either by some
mechanical and human device fitted with asbestos, or it was arranged by
magical art in order that the worshippers might be astonished, or some
devil under the name of Venus so signally manifested himself that this
prodigy both began and became permanent.  Now devils are attracted to
dwell in certain temples by means of the creatures (God’s creatures, not
theirs), who present to them what suits their various tastes.  They are
attracted not by food like animals, but, like spirits, by such symbols
as suit their taste, various kinds of stones, woods, plants, animals,
songs, rites.  And that men may provide these attractions, the devils
first of all cunningly seduce them, either by imbuing their hearts with
a secret poison, or by revealing themselves under a friendly guise, and
thus make a few of them their disciples, who become the instructors of
the multitude.  For unless they first instructed men, it were impossible
to know what each of them desires, what they shrink from, by what name
they should be invoked or constrained to be present.  Hence the origin
of magic and magicians.  But, above all, they possess the hearts of men,
and are chiefly proud of this possession when they transform themselves
into angels of light.  Very many things that occur, therefore, are their
doing; and these deeds of theirs we ought all the more carefully to shun
as we acknowledge them to be very surprising.  And yet these very deeds
forward my present arguments.  For if such marvels are wrought by
unclean devils, how much mightier are the holy angels! and what can not
that God do who made the angels themselves capable of working miracles!

<span id="iv.XXI.6-p3"></span>If, then, very many effects can be
contrived by human art, of so surprising a kind that the uninitiated
think them divine, as when, *e.g*., in a certain temple two magnets have
been adjusted, one in the roof, another in the floor, so that an iron
image is suspended in mid-air between them, one would suppose by the
power of the divinity, were he ignorant of the magnets above and
beneath; or, as in the case of that lamp of Venus which we already
mentioned as being a skillful adaptation of asbestos; if, again, by the
help of magicians, whom Scripture calls sorcerers and enchanters, the
devils could gain such power that the noble poet Virgil should consider
himself justified in describing a very powerful magician in these lines:

<span id="iv.XXI.6-p4"></span>“Her charms can cure what souls she
please,

<span id="iv.XXI.6-p5"></span>Rob other hearts of healthful ease,

<span id="iv.XXI.6-p6"></span>Turn rivers backward to their source,

<span id="iv.XXI.6-p7"></span>And make the stars forget their course,

<span id="iv.XXI.6-p8"></span>And call up ghosts from night:

<span id="iv.XXI.6-p9"></span>The ground shall bellow ’neath your feet:

<span id="iv.XXI.6-p10"></span>The mountain-ash shall quit its seat,

<span id="iv.XXI.6-p11"></span>And travel down the height;” <span
id="fr_1501"></span>[1502](#fn_1501.md) —

<span id="iv.XXI.6-p13"></span>if this be so, how much more able is God
to do those things which to sceptics are incredible, but to His power
easy, since it is He who has given to stones and all other things their
virtue, and to men their skill to use them in wonderful ways; He who has
given to the angels a nature more mighty than that of all that lives on
earth; He whose power surpasses all marvels, and whose wisdom in
working, ordaining, and permitting is no less marvellous in its
governance of all things than in its creation of all!
