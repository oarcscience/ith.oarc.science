id="iv.XXI.8-p1.1"></span>Chapter 8.—That It is Not Contrary to Nature
That, in an Object Whose Nature is Known, There Should Be Discovered an
Alteration of the Properties Which Have Been Known as Its Natural
Properties.</span>

<span id="iv.XXI.8-p2"></span>But if they reply that their reason for
not believing us when we say that human bodies will always burn and yet
never die, is that the nature of human bodies is known to be quite
otherwise constituted; if they say that for this miracle we cannot give
the reason which was valid in the case of those natural miracles, viz.,
that this is the natural property, the nature of the thing,—for we know
that this is not the nature of human flesh,—we find our answer in the
sacred writings, that even this human flesh was constituted in one
fashion before there was sin,—was constituted, in fact, so that it could
not die,—and in another fashion after sin, being made such as we see it
in this miserable state of mortality, unable to retain enduring life. 
And so in the resurrection of the dead shall it be constituted
differently from its present well-known condition.  But as they do not
believe these writings of ours, in which we read what nature man had in
paradise, and how remote he was from the necessity of death,—and indeed,
if they did believe them, we should of course have little trouble in
debating with them the future punishment of the damned,—we must produce
from the writings of their own most learned authorities some instances
to show that it is possible for a thing to become different from what it
was formerly known characteristically to be.

<span id="iv.XXI.8-p3"></span>From the book of Marcus Varro, entitled,
*Of the Race of the Roman People*, I cite word for word the following
instance:  “There occurred a remarkable celestial portent; for Castor
records that, in the brilliant star Venus, called Vesperugo by Plautus,
and the lovely Hesperus by Homer, there occurred so strange a prodigy,
that it changed its color, size, form, course, which never happened
before nor since.  Adrastus of Cyzicus, and Dion of Naples, famous
mathematicians, said that this occurred in the reign of Ogyges.”  So
great an author as Varro would certainly not have called this a portent
had it not seemed to be contrary to nature.  For we say that all
portents are contrary to nature; but they are not so.  For how is that
contrary to nature which happens by the will of God, since the will of
so mighty a Creator is certainly the nature of each created thing?  A
portent, therefore, happens not contrary to nature, but contrary to what
we know as nature.  But who can number the multitude of portents
recorded in profane histories?  Let us then at present fix our attention
on this one only which concerns the matter in hand.  What is there so
arranged by the Author of the nature of heaven and earth as the exactly
ordered course of the stars?  What is there established by laws so sure
and inflexible?  And yet, when it pleased Him who with sovereignty and
supreme power regulates all He has created, a star conspicuous among the
rest by its size and splendor changed its color, size, form, and, most
wonderful of all, the order and law of its course!  Certainly that
phenomenon disturbed the canons of the astronomers, if there were any
then, by which they tabulate, as by unerring computation, the past and
future movements of the stars, so as to take upon them to affirm that
this which happened to the morning star (Venus) never happened before
nor since.  But we read in the divine books that even the sun itself
stood still when a holy man, Joshua the son of Nun, had begged this from
God until victory should finish the battle he had begun; and that it
even went back, that the promise of fifteen years added to the life of
king Hezekiah might be sealed by this additional prodigy.  But these
miracles, which were vouchsafed to the merits of holy men, even when our
adversaries believe them, they attribute to magical arts; so Virgil, in
the lines I quoted above, ascribes to magic the power to

<span id="iv.XXI.8-p4"></span>“Turn rivers backward to their source,

<span id="iv.XXI.8-p5"></span>And make the stars forget their course.”

<span id="iv.XXI.8-p6"></span>For in our sacred books we read that this
also happened, that a river “turned backward,” was stayed above while
the lower part flowed on, when the people passed over under the
above-mentioned leader, Joshua the son of Nun; and also when Elias the
prophet crossed; and afterwards, when his disciple Elisha passed through
it:  and we have just <span id="page_460">p. 460</span> <span
id="iv.XXI.8-Page_460"></span> mentioned how, in the case of king
Hezekiah the greatest of the “stars forgot its course.”  But what
happened to Venus, according to Varro, was not said by him to have
happened in answer to any man’s prayer.

<span id="iv.XXI.8-p7"></span>Let not the sceptics then benight
themselves in this knowledge of the nature of things, as if divine power
cannot bring to pass in an object anything else than what their own
experience has shown them to be in its nature.  Even the very things
which are most commonly known as natural would not be less wonderful nor
less effectual to excite surprise in all who beheld them, if men were
not accustomed to admire nothing but what is rare.  For who that
thoughtfully observes the countless multitude of men, and their
similarity of nature, can fail to remark with surprise and admiration
the individuality of each man’s appearance, suggesting to us, as it
does, that unless men were like one another, they would not be
distinguished from the rest of the animals; while unless, on the other
hand, they were unlike, they could not be distinguished from one
another, so that those whom we declare to be like, we also find to be
unlike?  And the unlikeness is the more wonderful consideration of the
two; for a common nature seems rather to require similarity.  And yet,
because the very rarity of things is that which makes them wonderful, we
are filled with much greater wonder when we are introduced to two men so
like, that we either always or frequently mistake in endeavoring to
distinguish between them.

<span id="iv.XXI.8-p8"></span>But possibly, though Varro is a heathen
historian, and a very learned one, they may disbelieve that what I have
cited from him truly occurred; or they may say the example is invalid,
because the star did not for any length of time continue to follow its
new course, but returned to its ordinary orbit.  There is, then, another
phenomenon at present open to their observation, and which, in my
opinion, ought to be sufficient to convince them that, though they have
observed and ascertained some natural law, they ought not on that
account to prescribe to God, as if He could not change and turn it into
something very different from what they have observed.  The land of
Sodom was not always as it now is; but once it had the appearance of
other lands, and enjoyed equal if not richer fertility; for, in the
divine narrative, it was compared to the paradise of God.  But after it
was touched \[by fire\] from heaven, as even pagan history testifies,
and as is now witnessed by those who visit the spot, it became
unnaturally and horribly sooty in appearance; and its apples, under a
deceitful appearance of ripeness, contain ashes within.  Here is a thing
which was of one kind, and is of another.  You see how its nature was
converted by the wonderful transmutation wrought by the Creator of all
natures into so very disgusting a diversity,—an alteration which after
so long a time took place, and after so long a time still continues.  As
therefore it was not impossible to God to create such natures as He
pleased, so it is not impossible to Him to change these natures of His
own creation into whatever He pleases, and thus spread abroad a
multitude of those marvels which are called monsters, portents,
prodigies, phenomena, <span id="fr_1502"></span>[1503](#fn_1502.md) and
which if I were minded to cite and record, what end would there be to
this work?  They say that they are called “monsters,” because they
demonstrate or signify something; “portents,” because they portend
something; and so forth. <span id="fr_1503"></span>[1504](#fn_1503.md)  
But let their diviners see how they are either deceived, or even when
they do predict true things, it is because they are inspired by spirits,
who are intent upon entangling the minds of men (worthy, indeed, of such
a fate) in the meshes of a hurtful curiosity, or how they light now and
then upon some truth, because they make so many predictions.  Yet, for
our part, these things which happen contrary to nature, and are said to
be contrary to nature (as the apostle, speaking after the manner of men,
says, that to graft the wild olive into the good olive, and to partake
of its fatness, is contrary to nature), and are called monsters,
phenomena, portents, prodigies, ought to demonstrate, portend, predict
that God will bring to pass what He has foretold regarding the bodies of
men, no difficulty preventing Him, no law of nature prescribing to Him
His limit.  How He has foretold what He is to do, I think I have
sufficiently shown in the preceding book, culling from the sacred
Scriptures, both of the New and Old Testaments, not, indeed, all the
passages that relate to this, but as many as I judged to suffice for
this work.
