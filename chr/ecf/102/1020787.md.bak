id="v.vi.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 7.—The Useless Bondage of the
Gentiles.</span>

<span id="v.vi.vii-p2"></span>And if ever any of them endeavored to make
it out that their idols were only signs, yet still they used them in
reference to the worship and adoration of the creature.  What difference
does it make to me, for instance, that the image of Neptune is not
itself to be considered a god, but only as representing the wide ocean,
and all the other waters besides that spring out of fountains?  As it is
described by a poet of theirs, <span
id="fr_1856"></span>[1857](#fn_1856.md) who says, if I recollect aright,
“Thou, Father Neptune, whose hoary temples are wreathed with the
resounding sea, whose beard is the mighty ocean flowing forth
unceasingly, and whose <span id="page_560">p. 560</span> <span
id="v.vi.vii-Page_560"></span> hair is the winding rivers.”  This husk
shakes its rattling stones within a sweet covering, and yet it is not
food for men, but for swine.  He who knows the gospel knows what I
mean. <span id="fr_1857"></span>[1858](#fn_1857.md)   What profit is it to
me, then, that the image of Neptune is used with a reference to this
explanation of it, unless indeed the result be that I worship neither? 
For any statue you like to take is as much god to me as the wide ocean. 
I grant, however, that they who make gods of the works of man have sunk
lower than they who make gods of the works of God.  But the command is
that we should love and serve the One God, who is the Maker of all those
things, the images of which are worshipped by the heathen either as
gods, or as signs and representations of gods.  If, then, to take a sign
which has been established for a useful end instead of the thing itself
which it was designed to signify, is bondage to the flesh, how much more
so is it to take signs intended to represent useless things for the
things themselves!  For even if you go back to the very things signified
by such signs, and engage your mind in the worship of these, you will
not be anything the more free from the burden and the livery of bondage
to the flesh.
