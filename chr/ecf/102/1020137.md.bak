id="iv.IV.32-p1.1"></span>Chapter 32.—In What Interest the Princes of
the Nations Wished False Religions to Continue Among the People Subject
to Them.</span>

<span id="iv.IV.32-p2"></span>Varro says also, concerning the
generations of the gods, that the people have inclined to the poets
rather than to the natural philosophers; and that therefore their
forefathers,—that is, the ancient Romans,—believed both in the sex and
the generations of the gods, and settled their marriages; which
certainly seems to have been done for no other cause except that it was
the business of such men as were prudent and wise to deceive the people
in matters of religion, and in that very thing not only to worship, but
also to imitate the demons, whose greatest lust is to deceive.  For just
as the demons cannot possess any but those whom they have deceived with
guile, so also men in princely office, not indeed being just, but like
demons, have persuaded the people in the name of religion to receive as
true those things which they themselves knew to be false; in this way,
as it were, binding them up more firmly in civil society, so that they
might in like manner possess them as subjects.  But who that was weak
and unlearned could escape the deceits of both the princes of the state
and the demons?
