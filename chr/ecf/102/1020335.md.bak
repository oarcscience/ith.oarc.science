<span id="iv.XI.31-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XI.31-p1.1"></span>Chapter 31.—Of the Seventh Day, in Which
Completeness and Repose are Celebrated.</span>

<span id="iv.XI.31-p2"></span>But, on the seventh day (*i.e*., the same
day repeated seven times, which number is also a perfect one, though for
another reason), the rest of God is set forth, and then, too, we first
hear of its being hallowed.  So that God did not wish to hallow this day
by His works, but by His rest, which has no evening, for it is not a
creature; so that, being known in one way in the Word of God, and in
another in itself, it should make a twofold knowledge, daylight and dusk
(day and evening).  Much more might be said about the perfection of the
number seven, but this book is already too long, and I fear lest I
should seem to catch at an opportunity of airing my little smattering of
science more childishly than profitably.  I must speak, therefore, in
moderation and with dignity, lest, in too keenly following “number,” I
be accused of forgetting “weight” and “measure.”  Suffice it here to
say, that three is the first whole number that is odd, four the first
that is even, and of these two, seven is composed.  On this account it
is often put for all numbers together, as, “A just man falleth seven
times, and riseth up again,” <span id="fr_504"></span>[505](#fn_504.md)
—that is, let him fall never so often, he will not perish (and this was
meant to be understood not of sins, but of afflictions conducing to
lowliness).  Again, “Seven times a day will I praise Thee,” <span
id="fr_505"></span>[506](#fn_505.md) which elsewhere is expressed thus, “I
will bless the Lord *at all times*.” <span
id="fr_506"></span>[507](#fn_506.md)   And many such instances are found in
the divine authorities, in which the number seven is, as I said,
commonly used to express the whole, or the completeness of anything. 
And so the Holy Spirit, of whom the Lord says, “He will teach you all
truth,” <span id="fr_507"></span>[508](#fn_507.md) is signified by this
number. <span id="fr_508"></span>[509](#fn_508.md)   In it is the rest of
God, the rest His people find in Him.  For rest is in the whole, *i.e*.,
in perfect completeness, while in the part there is labor.  And thus we
labor as long as we know in part; “but when that which is perfect is
come, then that which is in part shall be done away.” <span
id="fr_509"></span>[510](#fn_509.md)   It is even with toil we search into
the Scriptures themselves.  But the holy angels, towards whose society
and assembly we sigh while in this our toilsome pilgrimage, as they
already abide in their eternal home, so do they enjoy perfect facility
of knowledge and felicity of rest.  It is without difficulty that they
help us; for their spiritual movements, pure and free, cost them no
effort.
