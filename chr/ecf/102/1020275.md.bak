id="iv.X.4-p1.1"></span>Chapter 4.—That Sacrifice is Due to the True God
Only.</span>

<span id="iv.X.4-p2"></span>But, putting aside for the present the other
religious services with which God is worshipped, certainly no man would
dare to say that sacrifice is due to any but God.  Many parts, indeed,
of divine worship are unduly used in showing honor to men, whether
through an excessive humility or pernicious flattery; yet, while this is
done, those persons who are thus worshipped and venerated, or even
adored, are reckoned no more than human; and who ever thought of
sacrificing save to one whom he knew, supposed, or feigned to be a god? 
And how ancient a part of God’s worship sacrifice is, those two <span
id="page_183">p. 183</span> <span id="iv.X.4-Page_183"></span> brothers,
Cain and Abel, sufficiently show, of whom God rejected the elder’s
sacrifice, and looked favorably on the younger’s.
