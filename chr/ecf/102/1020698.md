<span id="v.iv.ii-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="v.iv.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 2.—What a Thing Is, and What A
Sign.</span>

<span id="v.iv.ii-p2"></span>2.  All instruction is either about things
or about signs; but things are learnt by means of signs.  I now use the
word “thing” in a strict sense, to signify that which is never employed
as a sign of anything else:  for example, wood, stone, cattle, and other
things of that kind.  Not, however, the wood which we read Moses cast
into the bitter waters to make them sweet, <span
id="fr_1718"></span>[1719](#fn_1718) nor the stone which Jacob used as a
pillow, <span id="fr_1719"></span>[1720](#fn_1719) nor the ram which
Abraham offered up instead of his son; <span
id="fr_1720"></span>[1721](#fn_1720) for these, though they are things,
are also signs of other things.  There are signs of another kind, those
which are never employed except as signs:  for example, words.  No one
uses words except as signs of something else; and hence may be
understood what I call signs:  those things, to wit, which are used to
indicate something else.  Accordingly, every sign is also a thing; for
what is not a thing is nothing at all.  Every thing, however, is not
also a sign.  And so, in regard to this distinction between things and
signs, I shall, when I speak of things, speak in such a way that even if
some of them may be used as signs also, that will not interfere with the
division of the subject according to which I am to discuss things first
and signs afterwards.  But we must carefully remember that what we have
now to consider about things is what they are in themselves, not what
other things they are signs of.
