id="iv.XXII.13-p1.1"></span>Chapter 13.—Whether Abortions, If They are
Numbered Among the Dead, Shall Not Also Have a Part in the
Resurrection.</span>

<span id="iv.XXII.13-p2"></span>To these objections, then, of our
adversaries which I have thus detailed, I will now reply, trusting that
God will mercifully assist my endeavors.  That abortions, which, even
supposing they were alive in the womb, did also die there, shall rise
again, I make bold neither to affirm nor to deny, although I fail to see
why, if they are not excluded from the number of the dead, they should
not attain to the resurrection of the dead.  For either all the dead
shall not rise, and there will be to all eternity some souls without
bodies though they once had them,—only in their mother’s womb, indeed;
or, if all human souls shall receive again the bodies which they had
wherever they lived, and which they left when they died, then I do not
see how I can say that even those who died in their mother’s womb shall
have no resurrection.  But whichever of these opinions any one may adopt
concerning them, we must at least apply to them, if they rise again, all
that we have to say of infants who have been born.
