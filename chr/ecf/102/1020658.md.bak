<span id="iv.XXI.25-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XXI.25-p1.1"></span>Chapter 25.—Whether Those Who Received
Heretical Baptism, and Have Afterwards Fallen Away to Wickedness of
Life; Or Those Who Have Received Catholic Baptism, But Have Afterwards
Passed Over to Heresy and Schism; Or Those Who Have Remained in the
Catholic Church in Which They Were Baptized, But Have Continued to Live
Immorally,—May Hope Through the Virtue of the Sacraments for the
Remission of Eternal Punishment.</span>

<span id="iv.XXI.25-p2"></span>But let us now reply to those who promise
deliverance from eternal fire, not to the devil and his angels (as
neither do they of whom we have been speaking), nor even to all men
whatever, but only to those who have been washed by the baptism of
Christ, and have become partakers of His body and blood, no matter how
they have lived, no matter what heresy or impiety they have fallen
into.  But they are contradicted by the apostle, where he says, “Now the
works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; fornication,
uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variances,
emulations, wrath, strife, heresies, envyings, drunkenness, revellings,
and the like:  of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you
in time past, for they which do such things shall not inherit the
kingdom of God.” <span id="fr_1564"></span>[1565](#fn_1564.md)   Certainly
this sentence of the apostle is false, if such persons shall be
delivered after any lapse of time, and shall then inherit the kingdom of
God.  But as it is not false, they shall certainly never inherit the
kingdom of God.  And if they shall never enter that kingdom, then they
shall always be retained in eternal punishment; for there is no middle
place where he may live unpunished who has not been admitted into that
kingdom.

<span id="iv.XXI.25-p4"></span>And therefore we may reasonably inquire
how we are to understand these words of the Lord Jesus:  “This is the
bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not
die.  I am the living bread which came down from heaven.  If any man eat
of this bread, he shall live for ever.” <span
id="fr_1565"></span>[1566](#fn_1565.md)   And those, indeed, whom we are
now answering, are refuted in their interpretation of this passage by
those whom we are shortly to answer, and who do not promise this
deliverance to all who have received the sacraments of baptism and the
Lord’s body, but only to the catholics, however wickedly they live; for
these, say they, have eaten the Lord’s body not only sacramentally, but
really, being constituted members of His body, of which the apostle
says, “We being many are one bread, one body.” <span
id="fr_1566"></span>[1567](#fn_1566.md)   He then who is in the unity of
Christ’s body (that is to say, in the Christian membership), of which
body the faithful have been wont to receive the sacrament at the altar,
that man is truly said to eat the body and drink the blood of Christ. 
And consequently heretics and schismatics being separate from the unity
of this body, are able to receive the same sacrament, but with no profit
to themselves,—nay, rather to their own hurt, so that they are rather
more severely judged than liberated after some time.  For they are not
in that bond of peace which is symbolized by that sacrament.

<span id="iv.XXI.25-p7"></span>But again, even those who sufficiently
understand that he who is not in the body of Christ cannot be said to
eat the body of Christ, are in error when they promise liberation from
the fire of eternal punishment to persons who fall away from the unity
of that body into heresy, or even into heathenish superstition.  For, in
the first place, they ought to consider how intolerable it is, and how
discordant with sound doctrine, to suppose that many, indeed, or almost
all, who have forsaken the Church catholic, and have originated impious
heresies and become heresiarchs, should enjoy a destiny superior to
those who never were catholics, but have fallen into the snares of these
others; that is to say, if the fact of their catholic baptism and
original reception of the sacrament of the body of Christ in the true
body of Christ is sufficient to deliver these heresiarchs from eternal
punishment.  For certainly he who deserts the faith, and from a deserter
becomes an assailant, is worse than he who has not <span
id="page_473">p. 473</span> <span id="iv.XXI.25-Page_473"></span>
deserted the faith he never held.  And, in the second place, they are
contradicted by the apostle, who, after enumerating the works of the
flesh, says with reference to heresies, “They who do such things shall
not inherit the kingdom of God.”

<span id="iv.XXI.25-p8"></span>And therefore neither ought such persons
as lead an abandoned and damnable life to be confident of salvation,
though they persevere to the end in the communion of the Church
catholic, and comfort themselves with the words, “He that endureth to
the end shall be saved.”  By the iniquity of their life they abandon
that very righteousness of life which Christ is to them, whether it be
by fornication, or by perpetrating in their body the other uncleannesses
which the apostle would not so much as mention, or by a dissolute
luxury, or by doing any one of those things of which he says, “They who
do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.”  Consequently,
they who do such things shall not exist anywhere but in eternal
punishment, since they cannot be in the kingdom of God.  For, while they
continue in such things to the very end of life, they cannot be said to
abide in Christ to the end; for to abide in Him is to abide in the faith
of Christ.  And this faith, according to the apostle’s definition of it,
“worketh by love.” <span id="fr_1567"></span>[1568](#fn_1567.md)   And
“love,” as he elsewhere says, “worketh no evil.” <span
id="fr_1568"></span>[1569](#fn_1568.md)   Neither can these persons be said
to eat the body of Christ, for they cannot even be reckoned among His
members.  For, not to mention other reasons, they cannot be at once the
members of Christ and the members of a harlot.  In fine, He Himself,
when He says, “He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood, dwelleth
in me, and I in him,” <span id="fr_1569"></span>[1570](#fn_1569.md) shows
what it is in reality, and not sacramentally, to eat His body and drink
His blood; for this is to dwell in Christ, that He also may dwell in
us.  So that it is as if He said, He that dwelleth not in me, and in
whom I do not dwell, let him not say or think that he eateth my body or
drinketh my blood.  Accordingly, they who are not Christ’s members do
not dwell in Him.  And they who make themselves members of a harlot, are
not members of Christ unless they have penitently abandoned that evil,
and have returned to this good to be reconciled to it.
