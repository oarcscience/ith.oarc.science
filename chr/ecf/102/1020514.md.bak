id="iv.XVII.21-p1.1"></span>Chapter 21.—Of the Kings After Solomon, Both
in Judah and Israel.</span>

<span id="iv.XVII.21-p2"></span>The other kings of the Hebrews after
Solomon are scarcely found to have prophesied, through certain enigmatic
words or actions of theirs, what may pertain to Christ and the Church,
either in Judah or Israel; for so were the parts of that people styled,
when, on account of Solomon’s offence, from the time of <span

Rehoboam his son, who succeeded him in the kingdom, it was divided by
God as a punishment.  The ten tribes, indeed, which Jeroboam the servant
of Solomon received, being appointed the king in Samaria, were
distinctively called Israel, although this had been the name of that
whole people; but the two tribes, namely, of Judah and Benjamin, which
for David’s sake, lest the kingdom should be wholly wrenched from his
race, remained subject to the city of Jerusalem, were called Judah,
because that was the tribe whence David sprang.  But Benjamin, the other
tribe which, as was said, belonged to the same kingdom, was that whence
Saul sprang before David.  But these two tribes together, as was said,
were called Judah, and were distinguished by this name from Israel which
was the distinctive title of the ten tribes under their own king.  For
the tribe of Levi, because it was the priestly one, bound to the
servitude of God, not of the kings, was reckoned the thirteenth.  For
Joseph, one of the twelve sons of Israel, did not, like the others, form
one tribe, but two, Ephraim and Manasseh.  Yet the tribe of Levi also
belonged more to the kingdom of Jerusalem, where was the temple of God
whom it served.  On the division of the people, therefore, Rehoboam, son
of Solomon, reigned in Jerusalem as the first king of Judah, and
Jeroboam, servant of Solomon, in Samaria as king of Israel.  And when
Rehoboam wished as a tyrant to pursue that separated part with war, the
people were prohibited from fighting with their brethren by God, who
told them through a prophet that He had done this; whence it appeared
that in this matter there had been no sin either of the king or people
of Israel, but the accomplished will of God the avenger.  When this was
known, both parts settled down peaceably, for the division made was not
religious but political.
