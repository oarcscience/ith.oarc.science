<span id="iv.XII.5-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XII.5-p1.1"></span>Chapter 5.—That in All Natures, of Every Kind
and Rank, God is Glorified.</span>

<span id="iv.XII.5-p2"></span>All natures, then, inasmuch as they are,
and have therefore a rank and species of their own, and a kind of
internal harmony, are certainly good.  And when they are in the places
assigned to them by the order of their nature, they preserve such being
as they have received.  And those things which have not received
everlasting being, are altered for better or for worse, so as to suit
the wants <span id="page_229">p. 229</span> <span
id="iv.XII.5-Page_229"></span> and motions of those things to which the
Creator’s law has made them subservient; and thus they tend in the
divine providence to that end which is embraced in the general scheme of
the government of the universe.  So that, though the corruption of
transitory and perishable things brings them to utter destruction, it
does not prevent their producing that which was designed to be their
result.  And this being so, God, who supremely is, and who therefore
created every being which has not supreme existence (for that which was
made of nothing could not be equal to Him, and indeed could not be at
all had He not made it), is not to be found fault with on account of the
creature’s faults, but is to be praised in view of the natures He has
made.
