<span id="iv.VI-p3"></span>Argument—Hitherto the argument has been
conducted against those who believe that the gods are to be worshipped
for the sake of temporal advantages, now it is directed against those
who believe that they are to be worshipped for the sake of eternal
life.  Augustin devotes the five following books to the confutation of
this latter belief, and first of all shows how mean an opinion of the
gods was held by Varro himself, the most esteemed writer on heathen
theology.  Of this theology Augustin adopts Varro’s division into three
kinds, mythical, natural, and civil; and at once demonstrates that
neither the mythical nor the civil can contribute anything to the
happiness of the future life.
