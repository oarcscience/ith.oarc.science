id="iv.XVIII.4-p1.1"></span>Chapter 4.—Of the Times of Jacob and His Son
Joseph.</span>

<span id="iv.XVIII.4-p2"></span>In the reign of Balæus, the ninth king
of Assyria, and Mesappus, the eighth of Sicyon, who is said by some to
have been also called Cephisos (if indeed the same man had both names,
and those who put the other name in their writings have not rather
confounded him with another man), while Apis was third king of Argos,
Isaac died, a hundred and eighty years old, and left his twin-sons a
hundred and twenty years old.  Jacob, the younger of these, belonged to
the city of God about which we write (the elder being wholly rejected),
and had twelve sons, one of whom, called Joseph, was sold by his
brothers to merchants going down to Egypt, while his grandfather Isaac
was still alive.  But when he was thirty years of age, Joseph stood
before Pharaoh, being exalted out of the humiliation he endured,
because, in divinely interpreting the king’s dreams, he foretold that
there would be seven years of plenty, the very rich abundance of which
would be consumed by seven other years of famine that should follow.  On
this account the king made him ruler over Egypt, liberating him from
prison, into which he had been thrown for keeping his chastity intact;
for he bravely preserved it from his mistress, who wickedly loved him,
and told lies to his weakly credulous master, and did not consent to
commit adultery with her, but fled from her, leaving his garment in her
hands when she laid hold of him.  In the second of the seven years of
famine Jacob came down into Egypt to his son with all he had, being a
hundred and thirty years old, as he himself said in answer to the king’s
question.  Joseph was then thirty-nine, if we add seven years of plenty
and two of famine to the thirty he reckoned when honored by the king.
