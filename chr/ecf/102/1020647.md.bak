<span id="iv.XXI.14-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XXI.14-p1.1"></span>Chapter 14.—Of the Temporary Punishments of
This Life to Which the Human Condition is Subject.</span>

<span id="iv.XXI.14-p2"></span>Quite exceptional are those who are not
punished in this life, but only afterwards.  Yet that there have been
some who have reached the decrepitude of age without experiencing even
the slightest sickness, and who have had uninterrupted enjoyment of
life, I know both from report and from my own observation.  However, the
very life we mortals lead is itself all punishment, for it is all
temptation, as the Scriptures declare, where it is written, “Is not the
life of man upon earth a temptation?” <span
id="fr_1520"></span>[1521](#fn_1520.md)   For ignorance is itself no slight
punishment, or want of culture, which it is with justice thought so
necessary to escape, that boys are compelled, under pain of severe
punishment, to learn trades or letters; and the learning to which they
are driven by punishment is itself so much of a punishment to them, that
they sometimes prefer the pain that drives them to the pain to which
they are driven by it.  And who would not shrink from the alternative,
and elect to die, if it were proposed to him either to suffer death or
to be again an infant?  Our infancy, indeed, introducing us to this life
not with laughter but with tears, seems unconsciously to predict the
ills we are to encounter. <span id="fr_1521"></span>[1522](#fn_1521.md)  
Zoroaster alone is said to have laughed when he was born, and that
unnatural omen portended no good to him.  For he is said to have been
the inventor of magical arts, though indeed they were unable to secure
to him even the poor felicity of this present life against the assaults
of his enemies.  For, himself king of the Bactrians, he was conquered by
Ninus king of the Assyrians.  In short, the words of Scripture, “An
heavy yoke is upon the sons of Adam, from the day that they go out of
their mother’s womb till the day that they return to the mother of all
things,” <span id="fr_1522"></span>[1523](#fn_1522.md) —these words so
infallibly find fulfillment, that even the little ones, who by the layer
of regeneration have been freed from the bond of original sin in which
alone they were held, yet suffer many ills, and in some instances are
even exposed to the assaults of evil spirits.  But let us not for a
moment suppose that this suffering is prejudicial to their future
happiness, even though it has so increased as to sever soul from body,
and to terminate their life in that early age.
