id="iv.XII.21-p1.1"></span>Chapter 21.—That There Was Created at First
But One Individual, and that the Human Race Was Created in Him.</span>

<span id="iv.XII.21-p2"></span>Now that we have solved, as well as we
could, this very difficult question about the eternal God creating new
things, without any novelty of will, it is easy to see how much better
it is that God was pleased to produce the human race from the one
individual whom He created, than if He had originated it in several
men.  For as to the other animals, He created some solitary, and
naturally seeking lonely places,—as the eagles, kites, lions, wolves,
and such like; others gregarious, which herd together, and prefer to
live in company,—as pigeons, starlings, stags, and little fallow deer,
and the like:  but neither class did He cause to be propagated from
individuals, but called into being several at once.  Man, on the other
hand, whose nature was to be a mean between the angelic and bestial, He
created in such sort, that if he remained in subjection to His Creator
as his rightful Lord, and piously kept His commandments, he should pass
into the company of the angels, and obtain, without the intervention of
death, <span id="fr_564"></span>[565](#fn_564.md) a blessed and endless
immortality; but if he offended the Lord his God by a proud and
disobedient use of his free will, he should become subject to death, and
live as the beasts do,—the slave of appetite, and doomed to eternal
punishment after death.  And therefore God created only one single man,
not, certainly, that he might be a solitary, bereft of all society, but
that by this means the unity of society and the bond of concord might be
more effectually commended to him, men being bound together not only by
similarity of nature, but by family affection.  And indeed He did not
even create the woman that was to be given him as his wife, as he
created the man, but created her out of the man, that the whole human
race might derive from one man.
