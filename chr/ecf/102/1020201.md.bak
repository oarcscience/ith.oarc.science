id="iv.VII.18-p1.1"></span>Chapter 18.—A More Credible Cause of the Rise
of Pagan Error.</span>

<span id="iv.VII.18-p2"></span>A far more credible account of these gods
is given, when it is said that they were men, and that to each one of
them sacred rites and solemnities were instituted, according to his
particular genius, manners, actions, circumstances; which rites and
solemnities, by gradually creeping through the souls of men, which are
like demons, and eager for things which yield them sport, were spread
far and wide; the poets adorning them with lies, and false spirits
seducing men to receive them.  For it is far more likely that some
youth, either impious himself, or afraid of being slain by an impious
father, being desirous to reign, dethroned his father, than that
(according to Varro’s interpretation) Saturn was overthrown by his son
Jupiter:  for cause, which belongs to Jupiter, is before seed, which
belongs to Saturn.  For had this been so, Saturn would never have been
before Jupiter, nor would he have been the father of Jupiter.  For cause
always precedes seed, and is never generated <span id="page_133">p.
133</span> <span id="iv.VII.18-Page_133"></span> from seed.  But when
they seek to honor by natural interpretation most vain fables or deeds
of men, even the acutest men are so perplexed that we are compelled to
grieve for their folly also.
