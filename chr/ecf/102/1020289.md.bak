<span id="iv.X.18-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.X.18-p1.1"></span>Chapter 18.—Against Those Who Deny that the
Books of the Church are to Be Believed About the Miracles Whereby the
People of God Were Educated.</span>

<span id="iv.X.18-p2"></span>Will some one say that these miracles are
false, that they never happened, and that the records of them are lies? 
Whoever says so, and asserts that in such matters no records whatever
can be credited, may also say that there are no gods who care for human
affairs.  For they have induced men to worship them only by means of
miraculous works, which the heathen histories testify, and by which the
gods have made a display of their own power rather than done any real
service.  This is the reason why we have not undertaken in this work, of
which we are now writing the tenth book, to refute those who either deny
that there is any divine power, or contend that it does not interfere
with human affairs, but those who prefer their own god to our God, the
Founder of the holy and most glorious city, not knowing that He is also
the invisible and unchangeable Founder of this visible and changing
world, and the truest bestower of the blessed life which resides not in
things created, but in Himself.  For thus speaks His most trustworthy
prophet:  “It is good for me to be united to God.” <span
id="fr_412"></span>[413](#fn_412.md)   Among philosophers it is a question,
what is that end and good to the attainment of which all our duties are
to have a relation?  The Psalmist did not say, It is good for me to have
great wealth, or to wear imperial insignia, purple, sceptre, and diadem;
or, as some even of the philosophers have not blushed to say, It is good
for me to enjoy sensual pleasure; or, as the better men among them
seemed to say, My good is my spiritual strength; but, “It is good for me
to be united to God.”  This he had learned from Him whom the holy
angels, with the accompanying witness of miracles, presented as the sole
object of worship.  And hence he himself became the sacrifice of God,
whose spiritual love inflamed him, and into whose ineffable and
incorporeal embrace he yearned to cast himself.  Moreover, if the
worshippers of many gods (whatever kind of gods they fancy their own to
be) believe that the miracles recorded in their civil histories, or in
the books of magic, or of the more respectable theurgy, were wrought by
these gods, what reason have they for refusing to believe the miracles
recorded in those writings, to which we owe a credence as much greater
as He is greater to whom alone these writings teach us to sacrifice?
