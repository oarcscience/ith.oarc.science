id="iv.XIX.1-p1.1"></span>Chapter 1.—That Varro Has Made Out that Two
Hundred and Eighty-Eight Different Sects of Philosophy Might Be Formed
by the Various Opinions Regarding the Supreme Good.</span>

<span id="iv.XIX.1-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.XIX.1-p2.1"></span>As</span> I see that I have still to discuss
the fit destinies of the two cities, the earthly and the heavenly, I
must first explain, so far as the limits of this work allow me, the
reasonings by which men have attempted to make for themselves a
happiness in this unhappy life, in order that it may be evident, not
only from divine authority, but also from such reasons as can be adduced
to unbelievers, how the empty dreams of the philosophers differ from the
hope which God gives to us, and from the substantial fulfillment of it
which He will give us as our blessedness.  Philosophers have expressed a
great variety of diverse opinions regarding the ends of goods and of
evils, and this question they have eagerly canvassed, that they might,
if possible, discover what makes a man happy.  For the end of our good
is that for the sake of which other things are to be desired, while it
is to be desired for its own sake; and the end of evil is that on
account of which other things are to be shunned, while it is avoided on
its own account.  Thus, by the *end of good*, we at present mean, not
that by which good is destroyed, so that it no longer exists, but that
by which it is finished, so that it becomes complete; and by the *end of
evil* we mean, not that which abolishes it, but that which completes its
development.  These two ends, therefore, are the supreme good and the
supreme evil; and, as I have said, those who have in this vain life
professed the study of wisdom have been at great pains to discover these
ends, and to obtain the supreme good and avoid the supreme evil in this
life.  And although they erred in a variety of ways, yet natural insight
has prevented them from wandering from the truth so far that they have
not placed the supreme good and evil, some in the soul, some in the
body, and some in both.  From this tripartite distribution of the sects
of philosophy, Marcus Varro, in his book *De Philosophia*, <span
id="fr_1258"></span>[1259](#fn_1258.md) has drawn so large a variety of
opinions, that, by a subtle and minute analysis of distinctions, he
numbers without difficulty as many as 288 sects,—not that these have
actually existed, but sects which are possible.

<span id="iv.XIX.1-p4"></span>To illustrate briefly what he means, I
must begin with his own introductory statement in the above-mentioned
book, that there are four things which men desire, as it were by nature
without a master, without the help of any instruction, without industry
or the art of living which is called virtue, and which is certainly
learned: <span id="fr_1259"></span>[1260](#fn_1259.md)   either pleasure,
which is an agreeable stirring of the bodily sense; or repose, which
excludes every bodily inconvenience; or both these, which Epicurus calls
by the one name, pleasure; or the primary objects <span id="page_398">p.
398</span> <span id="iv.XIX.1-Page_398"></span> of nature, <span
id="fr_1260"></span>[1261](#fn_1260.md) which comprehend the things already
named and other things, either bodily, such as health, and safety, and
integrity of the members, or spiritual, such as the greater and less
mental gifts that are found in men.  Now these four things—pleasure,
repose, the two combined, and the primary objects of nature—exist in us
in such sort that we must either desire virtue on their account, or them
for the sake of virtue, or both for their own sake; and consequently
there arise from this distinction twelve sects, for each is by this
consideration tripled.  I will illustrate this in one instance, and,
having done so, it will not be difficult to understand the others. 
According, then, as bodily pleasure is subjected, preferred, or united
to virtue, there are three sects.  It is subjected to virtue when it is
chosen as subservient to virtue.  Thus it is a duty of virtue to live
for one’s country, and for its sake to beget children, neither of which
can be done without bodily pleasure.  For there is pleasure in eating
and drinking, pleasure also in sexual intercourse.  But when it is
preferred to virtue, it is desired for its own sake, and virtue is
chosen only for its sake, and to effect nothing else than the attainment
or preservation of bodily pleasure.  And this, indeed, is to make life
hideous; for where virtue is the slave of pleasure it no longer deserves
the name of virtue.  Yet even this disgraceful distortion has found some
philosophers to patronize and defend it.  Then virtue is united to
pleasure when neither is desired for the other’s sake, but both for
their own.  And therefore, as pleasure, according as it is subjected,
preferred, or united to virtue, makes three sects, so also do repose,
pleasure and repose combined, and the prime natural blessings, make
their three sects each.  For as men’s opinions vary, and these four
things are sometimes subjected, sometimes preferred, and sometimes
united to virtue, there are produced twelve sects.  But this number
again is doubled by the addition of one difference, viz., the social
life; for whoever attaches himself to any of these sects does so either
for his own sake alone, or for the sake of a companion, for whom he
ought to wish what he desires for himself.  And thus there will be
twelve of those who think some one of these opinions should be held for
their own sakes, and other twelve who decide that they ought to follow
this or that philosophy not for their own sakes only, but also for the
sake of others whose good they desire as their own.  These twenty-four
sects again are doubled, and become forty-eight by adding a difference
taken from the New Academy.  For each of these four and twenty sects can
hold and defend their opinion as certain, as the Stoics defended the
position that the supreme good of man consisted solely in virtue; or
they can be held as probable, but not certain, as the New Academics
did.  There are, therefore, twenty-four who hold their philosophy as
certainly true, other twenty-four who hold their opinions as probable,
but not certain.  Again, as each person who attaches himself to any of
these sects may adopt the mode of life either of the Cynics or of the
other philosophers, this distinction will double the number, and so make
ninety-six sects.  Then, lastly, as each of these sects may be adhered
to either by men who love a life of ease, as those who have through
choice or necessity addicted themselves to study, or by men who love a
busy life, as those who, while philosophizing, have been much occupied
with state affairs and public business, or by men who choose a mixed
life, in imitation of those who have apportioned their time partly to
erudite leisure, partly to necessary business:  by these differences the
number of the sects is tripled, and becomes 288.

<span id="iv.XIX.1-p7"></span>I have thus, as briefly and lucidly as I
could, given in my own words the opinions which Varro expresses in his
book.  But how he refutes all the rest of these sects, and chooses one,
the Old Academy, instituted by Plato, and continuing to Polemo, the
fourth teacher of that school of philosophy which held that their system
was certain; and how on this ground he distinguishes it from the New
Academy, <span id="fr_1261"></span>[1262](#fn_1261.md) which began with
Polemo’s successor Arcesilaus, and held that all things are uncertain;
and how he seeks to establish that the Old Academy was as free from
error as from doubt,—all this, I say, were too long to enter upon in
detail, and yet I must not altogether pass it by in silence.  Varro then
rejects, as a first step, all those differences which have multiplied
the number of sects; and the ground on which he does so is that they are
not differences about the supreme good.  He maintains that in philosophy
a sect is created only by its having an opinion of its own different
from other schools on the point of the ends-in-chief.  For man has no
other reason for philosophizing than that he may be happy; but that
which makes him happy is itself the supreme good.  In other words, the
supreme good is the reason of philosophizing; and therefore that cannot
be called a sect of philosophy which pursues no way of its own towards
the supreme good.  Thus, when it is <span id="page_399">p. 399</span>
<span id="iv.XIX.1-Page_399"></span> asked whether a wise man will adopt
the social life, and desire and be interested in the supreme good of his
friend as in his own, or will, on the contrary, do all that he does
merely for his own sake, there is no question here about the supreme
good, but only about the propriety of associating or not associating a
friend in its participation:  whether the wise man will do this not for
his own sake, but for the sake of his friend in whose good he delights
as in his own.  So, too, when it is asked whether all things about which
philosophy is concerned are to be considered uncertain, as by the New
Academy, or certain, as the other philosophers maintain, the question
here is not what end should be pursued, but whether or not we are to
believe in the substantial existence of that end; or, to put it more
plainly, whether he who pursues the supreme good must maintain that it
is a true good, or only that it appears to him to be true, though
possibly it may be delusive,—both pursuing one and the same good.  The
distinction, too, which is founded on the dress and manners of the
Cynics, does not touch the question of the chief good, but only the
question whether he who pursues that good which seems to himself true
should live as do the Cynics.  There were, in fact, men who, though they
pursued different things as the supreme good, some choosing pleasure,
others virtue, yet adopted that mode of life which gave the Cynics their
name.  Thus, whatever it is which distinguishes the Cynics from other
philosophers, this has no bearing on the choice and pursuit of that good
which constitutes happiness.  For if it had any such bearing, then the
same habits of life would necessitate the pursuit of the same chief
good, and diverse habits would necessitate the pursuit of different
ends.
