<span id="iv.XII.24-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XII.24-p1.1"></span>Chapter 24.—Whether the Angels Can Be Said to
Be the Creators of Any, Even the Least Creature.</span>

<span id="iv.XII.24-p2"></span>But in this book we have nothing to do
with those who do not believe that the divine mind made or cares for
this world.  As for those who believe their own Plato, that all mortal
animals—among whom man holds the pre-eminent place, and is near to the
gods themselves—were created not by that most high God who made the
world, but by other lesser gods created by the Supreme, and exercising a
delegated power under His control,—if only those persons be delivered
from the superstition which prompts them to seek a plausible reason for
paying divine honors and sacrificing to these gods as their creators,
they will easily be disentangled also from this their error.  For it is
blasphemy to believe or to say (even before it can be understood) that
any other than God is creator of any nature, be it never so small and
mortal.  And as for the angels, whom those Platonists prefer to call
gods, although they do, so far as they are permitted and commissioned,
aid in the production of the things around us, yet not on that account
are we to call them creators, any more than we call gardeners the
creators of fruits and trees.
