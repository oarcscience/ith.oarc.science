<span id="iv.XVIII.51-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XVIII.51-p1.1"></span>Chapter 51.—That the Catholic Faith May Be
Confirmed Even by the Dissensions of the Heretics.</span>

<span id="iv.XVIII.51-p2"></span>But the devil, seeing the temples of
the demons deserted, and the human race running to the name of the
liberating Mediator, has moved the heretics under the Christian name to
resist the Christian doctrine, as if they could be kept in the city of
God indifferently without any correction, just as the city of confusion
indifferently held the philosophers who were of diverse and adverse
opinions.  Those, therefore, in the Church of Christ who savor anything
morbid and depraved, and, on being corrected that they may savor what is
wholesome and right, contumaciously resist, and will not amend their
pestiferous and deadly dogmas, but persist in defending them, become
heretics, and, going without, are to be reckoned as enemies who serve
for her discipline.  For even thus they profit by their wickedness those
true catholic members of Christ, since God makes a good use even of the
wicked, and all things work together for good to them that love
Him. <span id="fr_1244"></span>[1245](#fn_1244)   For all the enemies of
the Church, whatever error blinds or malice depraves them, exercise her
patience if they receive the power to afflict her corporally; and if
they only oppose her by wicked thought, they exercise her wisdom:  but
at the same time, if these enemies are loved, they exercise her
benevolence, or even her beneficence, whether she deals with them by
persuasive doctrine or by terrible discipline.  And thus the devil, the
prince of the impious city, when he stirs up his own vessels against the
city of God that sojourns in this world, is permitted to do her no
harm.  For without doubt the divine providence procures for her both
consolation through prosperity, that she may not be broken by adversity,
and trial through adversity, that she may not be corrupted by
prosperity; and thus each is tempered by the other, as we recognize in
the Psalms that voice which arises from no other cause, “According to
the multitude of my griefs in my heart, Thy consolations have delighted
my soul.” <span id="fr_1245"></span>[1246](#fn_1245)   Hence also is
that saying of the apostle, “Rejoicing in hope, patient in
tribulation.” <span id="fr_1246"></span>[1247](#fn_1246)

<span id="iv.XVIII.51-p6"></span>For it is not to be thought that what
the same teacher says can at any time fail, “Whoever will live piously
in Christ shall suffer persecution.” <span
id="fr_1247"></span>[1248](#fn_1247)   Because even when those who are
without do not rage, and thus there seems to be, and really is,
tranquillity, which brings very much consolation, especially to the
weak, yet there are not wanting, yea, there are many within who by their
abandoned manners torment the hearts of those who live piously, since by
them the Christian and catholic name is blasphemed; and the dearer that
name is to those who will live piously in Christ, the more do they
grieve that through the wicked, who have a place within, it comes to be
less loved than pious minds desire.  The heretics themselves also, since
they are thought to have the Christian name and sacraments, Scriptures,
and profession, cause great grief in the hearts of the pious, both
because many who wish to be Christians are compelled by their
dissensions to hesitate, and many evil-speakers also find in them matter
for blaspheming the Christian name, because they too are at any rate
*called* Christians.  By these and similar depraved manners and errors
of men, those who will live piously in Christ suffer persecution, even
when no one molests or vexes their body; for they suffer this
persecution, not in their bodies, but in their hearts.  Whence is that
word, “According to the multitude of my griefs in my heart;” for he does
not say, in my body.  Yet, on the other hand, none of them can perish,
because the immutable divine promises are thought of.  And because the
apostle says, “The Lord knoweth them that are His; <span
id="fr_1248"></span>[1249](#fn_1248) for whom He did foreknow, He also
predestinated \[to be\] conformed to the image of His Son,” <span
id="fr_1249"></span>[1250](#fn_1249) none of them can perish; therefore
it follows in that psalm, “Thy consolations have delighted my
soul.” <span id="fr_1250"></span>[1251](#fn_1250)   But that grief which
arises in the hearts of the pious, who are persecuted by the manners of
bad or false Christians, is profitable to the sufferers, because it
proceeds from the charity in which they do not wish them either to
perish or to hinder the salvation of others.  Finally, great
consolations grow out of their chastisement, which imbue the souls of
the pious with a fecundity as great as the pains with which they were
troubled concerning their own perdition.  Thus in this world, in these
evil days, not only from the time of the bodily presence of Christ and
His apostles, but even from that of Abel, whom first his wicked brother
slew because he was righteous, <span
id="fr_1251"></span>[1252](#fn_1251) and thenceforth even to the end of
this world, the Church has gone forward on pilgrimage amid the
persecutions of the world and the consolations of God.
