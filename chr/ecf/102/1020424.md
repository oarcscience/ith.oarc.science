<span id="iv.XV.3-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XV.3-p1.1"></span>Chapter 3.—That Sarah’s Barrenness was Made
Productive by God’s Grace.</span>

<span id="iv.XV.3-p2"></span>Sarah, in fact, was barren; and, despairing
of offspring, and being resolved that she would have at least through
her handmaid that blessing she saw she could not in her own person <span
id="page_286">p. 286</span> <span id="iv.XV.3-Page_286"></span> procure,
she gave her handmaid to her husband, to whom she herself had been
unable to bear children.  From him she required this conjugal duty,
exercising her own right in another’s womb.  And thus Ishmael was born
according to the common law of human generation, by sexual intercourse. 
Therefore it is said that he was born “according to the flesh,”—not
because such births are not the gifts of God, nor His handiwork, whose
creative wisdom “reaches,” as it is written, “from one end to another
mightily, and sweetly doth she order all things,” <span
id="fr_772"></span>[773](#fn_772.md) but because, in a case in which the
gift of God, which was not due to men and was the gratuitous largess of
grace, was to be conspicuous, it was requisite that a son be given in a
way which no effort of nature could compass.  Nature denies children to
persons of the age which Abraham and Sarah had now reached; besides
that, in Sarah’s case, she was barren even in her prime.  This nature,
so constituted that offspring could not be looked for, symbolized the
nature of the human race vitiated by sin and by just consequence
condemned, which deserves no future felicity.  Fitly, therefore, does
Isaac, the child of promise, typify the children of grace, the citizens
of the free city, who dwell together in everlasting peace, in which
self-love and self-will have no place, but a ministering love that
rejoices in the common joy of all, of many hearts makes one, that is to
say, secures a perfect concord.
