<span id="iv.IX.11-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.IX.11-p1.1"></span>Chapter 11.—Of the Opinion of the Platonists,
that the Souls of Men Become Demons When Disembodied.</span>

<span id="iv.IX.11-p2"></span>He <span id="fr_349"></span>[350](#fn_349.md)
says, indeed, that the souls of men are demons, and that men become
*Lares* if they are good, *Lemures* or *Larvæ* if they are bad, and
*Manes* if it is uncertain whether they de <span id="page_172">p.
172</span> <span id="iv.IX.11-Page_172"></span> serve well or ill.  Who
does not see at a glance that this is a mere whirlpool sucking men to
moral destruction?  For, however wicked men have been, if they suppose
they shall become Larvæ or divine Manes, they will become the worse the
more love they have for inflicting injury; for, as the Larvæ are hurtful
demons made out of wicked men, these men must suppose that after death
they will be invoked with sacrifices and divine honors that they may
inflict injuries.  But this question we must not pursue.  He also states
that the blessed are called in Greek <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.IX.11-p3.1"></span>εὐδαίμονες</span>, because they are good
souls, that is to say, good demons, confirming his opinion that the
souls of men are demons.
