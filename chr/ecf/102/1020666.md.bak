<span id="iv.XXII.5-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XXII.5-p1.1"></span>Chapter 5.—Of the Resurrection of the Flesh,
Which Some Refuse to Believe, Though the World at Large Believes
It.</span>

<span id="iv.XXII.5-p2"></span>But granting that this was once
incredible, behold, now, the world has come to the belief that the
earthly body of Christ was received up into heaven.  Already both the
learned and unlearned have believed in the resurrection of the flesh and
its ascension to the heavenly places, while only a very few either of
the educated or uneducated are still staggered by it.  If this is a
credible thing which is believed, then let those who do not believe see
how stolid they are; and if it is incredible, then this also is an
incredible thing, that what is incredible should have received such
credit.  Here then we have two incredibles,—to wit, the resurrection of
our body to eternity, and that the world should believe so incredible a
thing; and both these incredibles the same God predicted should come to
pass before either had as yet occurred.  We see that already one of the
two has come to pass, <span id="page_482">p. 482</span> <span
id="iv.XXII.5-Page_482"></span> for the world has believed what was
incredible; why should we despair that the remaining one shall also come
to pass, and that this which the world believed, though it was
incredible, shall itself occur?  For already that which was equally
incredible has come to pass, in the world’s believing an incredible
thing.  Both were incredible:  the one we see accomplished, the other we
believe shall be; for both were predicted in those same Scriptures by
means of which the world believed.  And the very manner in which the
world’s faith was won is found to be even more incredible if we consider
it.  Men uninstructed in any branch of a liberal education, without any
of the refinement of heathen learning, unskilled in grammar, not armed
with dialectic, not adorned with rhetoric, but plain fishermen, and very
few in number,—these were the men whom Christ sent with the nets of
faith to the sea of this world, and thus took out of every race so many
fishes, and even the philosophers themselves, wonderful as they are
rare.  Let us add, if you please, or because you ought to be pleased,
this third incredible thing to the two former.  And now we have three
incredibles, all of which have yet come to pass.  It is incredible that
Jesus Christ should have risen in the flesh and ascended with flesh into
heaven; it is incredible that the world should have believed so
incredible a thing; it is incredible that a very few men, of mean birth
and the lowest rank, and no education, should have been able so
effectually to persuade the world, and even its learned men, of so
incredible a thing.  Of these three incredibles, the parties with whom
we are debating refuse to believe the first; they cannot refuse to see
the second, which they are unable to account for if they do not believe
the third.  It is indubitable that the resurrection of Christ, and His
ascension into heaven with the flesh in which He rose, is already
preached and believed in the whole world.  If it is not credible, how is
it that it has already received credence in the whole world?  If a
number of noble, exalted, and learned men had said that they had
witnessed it, and had been at pains to publish what they had witnessed,
it were not wonderful that the world should have believed it, but it
were very stubborn to refuse credence; but if, as is true, the world has
believed a few obscure, inconsiderable, uneducated persons, who state
and write that they witnessed it, is it not unreasonable that a handful
of wrong-headed men should oppose themselves to the creed of the whole
world, and refuse their belief?  And if the world has put faith in a
small number of men, of mean birth and the lowest rank, and no
education, it is because the divinity of the thing itself appeared all
the more manifestly in such contemptible witnesses.  The eloquence,
indeed, which lent persuasion to their message, consisted of wonderful
works, not words.  For they who had not seen Christ risen in the flesh,
nor ascending into heaven with His risen body, believed those who
related how they had seen these things, and who testified not only with
words but wonderful signs.  For men whom they knew to be acquainted with
only one, or at most two languages, they marvelled to hear speaking in
the tongues of all nations.  They saw a man, lame from his mother’s
womb, after forty years stand up sound at their word in the name of
Christ; that handkerchiefs taken from their bodies had virtue to heal
the sick; that countless persons, sick of various diseases, were laid in
a row in the road where they were to pass, that their shadow might fall
on them as they walked, and that they forthwith received health; that
many other stupendous miracles were wrought by them in the name of
Christ; and, finally, that they even raised the dead.  If it be admitted
that these things occurred as they are related, then we have a multitude
of incredible things to add to those three incredibles.  That the one
incredibility of the resurrection and ascension of Jesus Christ may be
believed, we accumulate the testimonies of countless incredible
miracles, but even so we do not bend the frightful obstinacy of these
sceptics.  But if they do not believe that these miracles were wrought
by Christ’s apostles to gain credence to their preaching of His
resurrection and ascension, this one grand miracle suffices for us, that
the whole world has believed without any miracles.
