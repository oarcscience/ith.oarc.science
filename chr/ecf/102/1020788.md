Bondage in One Way, the Gentiles in Another.</span>

<span id="v.vi.viii-p2"></span>12.  Accordingly the liberty that comes
by Christ took those whom it found under bondage to useful signs, and
who were (so to speak) near to it, and, interpreting the signs to which
they were in bondage, set them free by raising them to the realities of
which these were signs.  And out of such were formed the churches of the
saints of Israel.  Those, on the other hand, whom it found in bondage to
useless signs, it not only freed from their slavery to such signs, but
brought to nothing and cleared out of the way all these signs
themselves, so that the Gentiles were turned from the corruption of a
multitude of false gods, which Scripture frequently and justly speaks of
as fornication, to the worship of the One God:  not that they might now
fall into bondage to signs of a useful kind, but rather that they might
exercise their minds in the spiritual understanding of such.
