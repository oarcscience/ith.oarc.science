id="iv.XVII.22-p1.1"></span>Chapter 22.—Of Jeroboam, Who Profaned the
People Put Under Him by the Impiety of Idolatry, Amid Which, However,
God Did Not Cease to Inspire the Prophets, and to Guard Many from the
Crime of Idolatry.</span>

<span id="iv.XVII.22-p2"></span>But Jeroboam king of Israel, with
perverse mind, not believing in God, whom he had proved true in
promising and giving him the kingdom, was afraid lest, by coming to the
temple of God which was in Jerusalem, where, according to the divine
law, that whole nation was to come in order to sacrifice, the people
should be seduced from him, and return to David’s line as the seed
royal; and set up idolatry in his kingdom, and with horrible impiety
beguiled the people, ensnaring them to the worship of idols with
himself.  Yet God did not altogether cease to reprove by the prophets,
not only that king, but also his successors and imitators in his
impiety, and the people too.  For there the great and illustrious
prophet Elijah and Elisha his disciple arose, who also did many
wonderful works.  Even there, when Elijah said, “O Lord, they have slain
Thy prophets, they have digged down Thine altars; and I am left alone,
and they seek my life,” it was answered that seven thousand men were
there who had not bowed the knee to Baal. <span
