<p class="c21"><a name="iv.XII.16-p2"></A>I own that I do not know what ages passed before the human race was created, yet I have no doubt that no created thing is co-eternal with the Creator.&#160; But even the apostle speaks of time as eternal, and this with reference, not to the future, but, which is more surprising, to the past.&#160; For he says, &#8220;In hope of eternal life, which God that cannot lie promised before the eternal times, but hath  <A NAME="page_237"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 237</FONT></A> <a name="iv.XII.16-Page_237"></A>  in due times manifested His word.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_552"></A><A HREF="#fn_552"><FONT SIZE="1">553</FONT></A>
&#160; You see he says that in the past there have been eternal times, which, however, were not co-eternal with God.&#160; And since God before these eternal times not only existed, but also, &#8220;promised&#8221; life eternal, which He manifested in its own times (that is to say, in due times), what else is this than His word?&#160; For this is life eternal.&#160; But then, how did He promise; for the promise was made to men, and yet they had no existence before eternal times?&#160; Does this not mean that, in His own eternity, and in His co-eternal word, that which was to be in its own time was already predestined and fixed?</p>
