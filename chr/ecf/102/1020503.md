<span id="iv.XVII.10-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XVII.10-p1.1"></span>Chapter 10.—How Different the Acts in the
Kingdom of the Earthly Jerusalem are from Those Which God Had Promised,
So that the Truth of the Promise Should Be Understood to Pertain to the
Glory of the Other King and Kingdom.</span>

<span id="iv.XVII.10-p2"></span>That it might not be supposed that a
promise so strongly expressed and confirmed was fulfilled in Solomon, as
if he hoped for, yet did not find it, he says, “But Thou hast cast off,
and hast brought to nothing, O Lord.” <span
id="fr_1055"></span>[1056](#fn_1055.md)   This truly was done concerning
the kingdom of Solomon among his posterity, even to the overthrow of the
earthly Jerusalem itself, which was the seat of the kingdom, and
especially the destruction of the very temple which had been built by
Solomon.  But lest on this account God should be thought to have done
contrary to His promise, immediately he adds, “Thou hast delayed Thy
Christ.” <span id="fr_1056"></span>[1057](#fn_1056.md)   Therefore he is
not Solomon, nor yet David himself, if the Christ of the Lord is
delayed.  For while all the kings are called His christs, who were
consecrated with that mystical chrism, not only from king David
downwards, but even from that Saul who first was anointed king of that
same people, David himself indeed calling him the Lord’s christ, yet
there was one true Christ, whose figure they bore by the prophetic
unction, who, according to the opinion of men, who thought he was to be
understood as come in David or in Solomon, was long delayed, but who,
according as God had disposed, was to come in His own time.  The
following part of this psalm goes on to say what in the meantime, while
He was delayed, was to become of the kingdom of the earthly Jerusalem,
where it was hoped He would certainly reign:  “Thou hast overthrown the
covenant of Thy servant; Thou hast profaned in the earth his sanctuary. 
Thou hast broken down all his walls; Thou hast put his strong-holds in
fear.  All that pass by the way spoil him; he is made a reproach to his
neighbors.  Thou hast set up the right hand of his enemies; Thou hast
made all his enemies to rejoice.  Thou hast turned aside the help of his
sword, and hast not helped him in war.  Thou hast destroyed him from
cleansing; Thou hast dashed down his seat to the ground.  Thou hast
shortened the days of his seat; Thou hast poured confusion over
him.” <span id="fr_1057"></span>[1058](#fn_1057.md)   All these things came
upon Jerusalem the bond woman, in which some also reigned who were
children of the free woman, holding that kingdom in temporary
stewardship, but holding the kingdom of the heavenly Jerusalem, whose
children they were, in true faith, and hoping in the true Christ.  But
how these things came upon that kingdom, the history of its affairs
points out if it is read.
