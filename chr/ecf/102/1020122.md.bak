id="iv.IV.17-p1.1"></span>Chapter 17.—Whether, If the Highest Power
Belongs to Jove, Victoria Also Ought to Be Worshipped.</span>

<span id="iv.IV.17-p2"></span>Or do they say, perhaps, that Jupiter
sends the goddess Victoria, and that she, as it were acting in obedience
to the king of the gods, comes to those to whom he may have despatched
her, and takes up her quarters on their side?  This is truly said, not
of Jove, whom they, according to their own imagination, feign to be king
of the gods, but of Him who is the true eternal King, because he sends,
not Victory, who is no person, but His angel, and causes whom He pleases
to conquer; whose counsel may be hidden, but cannot be unjust.  For if
Victory is a goddess, why is not Triumph also a god, and joined to
Victory either as husband, or brother, or son?  Indeed, they have
imagined such things concerning the gods, that if the poets had feigned
the like, and they should have been discussed by us, they would have
replied that they were laughable figments of the poets not to be
attributed to true deities.  And yet they themselves did not laugh when
they were, not reading in the poets, but worshipping in the temples such
doating follies.  Therefore they should entreat Jove alone for all
things, and supplicate him only.  For if Victory is a goddess, and is
under him as her king, wherever he might have sent her, she could not
dare to resist and do her own will rather than his.
