id="iv.VII.2-p1.1"></span>Chapter 2.—Who are the Select Gods, and
Whether They are Held to Be Exempt from the Offices of the Commoner
Gods.</span>

<span id="iv.VII.2-p2"></span>The following gods, certainly, Varro
signalizes as select, devoting one book to this subject:  Janus,
Jupiter, Saturn, Genius, Mercury, Apollo, Mars, Vulcan, Neptune, Sol,
Orcus, father Liber, Tellus, Ceres, Juno, Luna, Diana, Minerva, Venus,
Vesta; of which twenty gods, twelve are males, and eight females. 
Whether are these deities called select, because of their higher spheres
of administration in the world, or because they have become better known
to the people, and more worship has been expended on them?  If it be on
account of the greater works which are performed by them in the world,
we ought not to have found them among that, as it were, plebeian crowd
of deities, which has assigned to it the charge of minute and trifling
things.  For, first of all, at the conception of a fœtus, from which
point all the works commence which have been distributed in minute
detail to many deities, Janus himself opens the way for the reception of
the seed; there also is Saturn, on account of the seed itself; there is
Liber, <span id="fr_250"></span>[251](#fn_250.md) who liberates the male by
the effusion of the seed; there is Libera, whom they also would have to
be Venus, who confers this same benefit on the woman, namely, that she
also be liberated by the emission of the seed;—all these are of the
number of those who are called select.  But there is also the goddess
Mena, who presides over the menses; though the daughter of Jupiter,
ignoble nevertheless.  And this province of the menses the same author,
in his book on the select gods, assigns to Juno herself, who is even
queen among the select gods; and here, as Juno Lucina, along with the
same Mena, her stepdaughter, she presides over the same blood.  There
also are two gods, exceedingly obscure, Vitumnus and Sentinus—the one of
whom imparts life to the fœtus, and the other sensation; and, of a
truth, they bestow, most ignoble though they be, far more than all those
noble and select gods bestow.  For, surely, without life and sensation,
what is the whole fœtus which a woman carries in her womb, but a most
vile and worthless thing, no better than slime and dust?

this Liber from Liber Bacchus, son of Jupiter and Semele.
