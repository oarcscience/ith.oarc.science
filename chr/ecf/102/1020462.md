<span id="iv.XVI.13-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XVI.13-p1.1"></span>Chapter 13.—Why, in the Account of Terah’s
Emigration, on His Forsaking the Chaldeans and Passing Over into
Mesopotamia, No Mention is Made of His Son Nahor.</span>

<span id="iv.XVI.13-p2"></span>Next it is related how Terah with his
family left the region of the Chaldeans and came into Mesopotamia, and
dwelt in Haran.  But <span id="page_319">p. 319</span> <span
id="iv.XVI.13-Page_319"></span> nothing is said about one of his sons
called Nahor, as if he had not taken him along with him.  For the
narrative runs thus:  “And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of
Haran, his son’s son, and Sarah his daughter-in-law, his son Abram’s
wife, and led them forth out of the region of the Chaldeans to go into
the land of Canaan; and he came into Haran, and dwelt there.” <span
id="fr_889"></span>[890](#fn_889.md)   Nahor and Milcah his wife are
nowhere named here.  But afterwards, when Abraham sent his servant to
take a wife for his son Isaac, we find it thus written:  “And the
servant took ten camels of the camels of his lord, and of all the goods
of his lord, with him; and arose, and went into Mesopotamia, into the
city of Nahor.” <span id="fr_890"></span>[891](#fn_890.md)   This and other
testimonies of this sacred history show that Nahor, Abraham’s brother,
had also left the region of the Chaldeans, and fixed his abode in
Mesopotamia, where Abraham dwelt with his father.  Why, then, did the
Scripture not mention him, when Terah with his family went forth out of
the Chaldean nation and dwelt in Haran, since it mentions that he took
with him not only Abraham his son, but also Sarah his daughter-in-law,
and Lot his grandson?  The only reason we can think of is, that perhaps
he had lapsed from the piety of his father and brother, and adhered to
the superstition of the Chaldeans, and had afterwards emigrated thence,
either through penitence, or because he was persecuted as a suspected
person.  For in the book called Judith, when Holofernes, the enemy of
the Israelites, inquired what kind of nation that might be, and whether
war should be made against them, Achior, the leader of the Ammonites,
answered him thus:  “Let our lord now hear a word from the mouth of thy
servant, and I will declare unto thee the truth concerning the people
which dwelleth near thee in this hill country, and there shall no lie
come out of the mouth of thy servant.  For this people is descended from
the Chaldeans, and they dwelt heretofore in Mesopotamia, because they
would not follow the gods of their fathers, which were glorious in the
land of the Chaldeans, but went out of the way of their ancestors, and
adored the God of heaven, whom they knew; and they cast them out from
the face of their gods, and they fled into Mesopotamia, and dwelt there
many days.  And their God said to them, that they should depart from
their habitation, and go into the land of Canaan; and they dwelt,” <span
id="fr_891"></span>[892](#fn_891.md) etc., as Achior the Ammonite
narrates.  Whence it is manifest that the house of Terah had suffered
persecution from the Chaldeans for the true piety with which they
worshipped the one and true God.
