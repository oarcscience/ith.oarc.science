<p class="c34"><a name="v.IV_1.3-p1"></A><span class="c2"><a name="v.IV_1.3-p1.1"></A>Chapter 3.&#8212;The Proper Age and the Proper Means for Acquiring Rhetorical Skill.</span></p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="v.IV_1.3-p2"></A>4.&#160; But the theories and rules on this subject (to which, when you add a tongue thoroughly skilled by exercise and habit in the use of many words and many ornaments of speech, you have what is called <i>eloquence</i> or <i>oratory</i>) may be learnt apart from these writings of mine, if a suitable space of time be set aside for the purpose at a fit and proper age.&#160; But only by those who can learn them quickly; for the masters of Roman eloquence&#160; themselves did not shrink from saying that any one who cannot learn this art quickly can never thoroughly learn it at all.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1935"></A><A HREF="#fn_1935"><FONT SIZE="1">1936</FONT></A>
&#160; Whether this be true or not, why need we inquire?&#160; For even if this art can occasionally be in the end mastered by men of slower intellect, I do not think it of so much importance as to wish men who have arrived at mature age to spend time in learning it.&#160; It is enough that boys should give attention to it; and even of these, not all who are to be fitted for usefulness in the Church, but only those who are not yet engaged in any occupation of more urgent necessity, or which ought evidently to take precedence of it.&#160; For men of quick intellect and glowing temperament find it easier to become eloquent by reading and listening to eloquent speakers than by following rules for eloquence.&#160; And even outside the canon, which to our great advantage is fixed in a place of secure authority, there is no want of ecclesiastical writings, in reading which a man of ability will acquire a tinge of the eloquence with which they are written, even though he does not aim at this, but is solely intent on the matters treated of; especially, of course, if in addition he practise himself in writing, or dictating, and at last also in speaking, the opinions he has formed on grounds of piety and faith.&#160; If, however, such ability be wanting, the rules of rhetoric are either not understood, or if, after great labor has been spent in enforcing them, they come to be in some small measure understood, they prove of no service.&#160; For even those who have learnt them, and who speak with fluency and elegance, cannot always think of them when they are speaking so as to speak in accordance with them, unless they are discussing the rules themselves.&#160; Indeed, I think there are scarcely any who can do both things&#8212;that is, speak well, and, in order to do this, think of the rules of speaking while they are speaking.&#160; For we must be careful that what we have got to say does not escape us whilst we are thinking about saying it according to the rules of art. Nevertheless, in the speeches of eloquent men, we find rules of eloquence carried out which the speakers did not think of as aids to eloquence at the time when they were speaking, whether they had ever learnt them, or whether they had never even met with them.&#160; For it is because they are eloquent that they exemplify these rules; it is not that they use them in order to be eloquent.</p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="v.IV_1.3-p4"></A>5.&#160; And, therefore, as infants cannot learn to speak except by learning words and phrases from those who do speak, why should not  <A NAME="page_576"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 576</FONT></A> <a name="v.IV_1.3-Page_576"></A>  men become eloquent without being taught any art of speech, simply by reading and learning the speeches of eloquent men, and by imitating them as far as they can?&#160; And what do we find from the examples themselves to be the case in this respect?&#160; We know numbers who, without acquaintance with rhetorical rules, are more eloquent than many who have learnt these; but we know no one who is eloquent without having read and listened to the speeches and debates of eloquent men.&#160; For even the art of grammar, which teaches correctness of speech, need not be learnt by boys, if they have the advantage of growing up and living among men who speak correctly.&#160; For without knowing the names of any of the faults, they will, from being accustomed to correct speech, lay hold upon whatever is faulty in the speech of any one they listen to, and avoid it; just as city-bred men, even when illiterate, seize upon the faults of rustics.</p>
