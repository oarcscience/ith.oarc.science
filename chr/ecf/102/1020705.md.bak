<span id="v.iv.ix-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="v.iv.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 9.—All Acknowledge the Superiority of
Unchangeable Wisdom to that Which is Variable.</span>

<span id="v.iv.ix-p2"></span>9.  Now, no one is so egregiously silly as
to ask, “How do you know that a life of unchangeable wisdom is
preferable to one of change?”  For that very truth about which he asks,
how I know it? is unchangeably fixed in the minds of all men, and
presented to their common contemplation.  And the man who does not see
it is like a blind man in the sun, whom it profits nothing that the
splendor of its light, so clear and so near, is poured into his very
eye-balls.  The man, on the other hand, who sees, but shrinks from this
truth, is weak in his mental vision from dwelling long among the shadows
of the flesh.  And thus men are driven back from their native land by
the contrary blasts of evil habits, and pursue lower and less valuable
objects in preference to that which they own to be more excellent and
more worthy.
