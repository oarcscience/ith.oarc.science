<span id="iv.XV.9-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XV.9-p1.1"></span>Chapter 9.—Of the Long Life and Greater Stature
of the Antediluvians.</span>

<span id="iv.XV.9-p2"></span>Wherefore no one who considerately weighs
facts will doubt that Cain might have built a city, and that a large
one, when it is observed how prolonged were the lives of men, unless
perhaps some sceptic take exception to this very length of years which
our authors ascribe to the antediluvians and deny that this is
credible.  And so, too, they do not believe that the size of men’s
bodies was larger then than now, though the most esteemed of their own
poets, Virgil, asserts the same, when he speaks of that huge stone which
had been fixed as a landmark, and which a strong man of those ancient
times snatched up as he fought, and ran, and hurled, and cast it,—

<span id="iv.XV.9-p3"></span>“Scarce twelve strong men of later mould

<span id="iv.XV.9-p4"></span>That weight could on their necks
uphold.” <span id="fr_798"></span>[799](#fn_798.md)

<span id="iv.XV.9-p6"></span>thus declaring his opinion that the earth
then produced mightier men.  And if in the more recent times, how much
more in the ages before the world-renowned deluge?  But the large size
of the primitive human body is often proved to the incredulous by the
exposure of sepulchres, either through the wear of time or the violence
of torrents or some accident, and in which bones of incredible size have
been found or have rolled out.  I myself, along with some others, saw on
the shore at Utica a man’s molar tooth of such a size, that if it were
cut down into teeth such as we have, a hundred, I fancy, could have been
made out of it.  But that, I believe, belonged to some giant.  For
though the bodies of ordinary men were then larger than ours, the giants
surpassed all in stature.  And neither in our own age nor any other have
there been altogether wanting instances of gigantic stature, though they
may be few.  The younger Pliny, a most learned man, maintains that the
older the world becomes, the smaller will be the bodies of men. <span
id="fr_799"></span>[800](#fn_799.md)   And he mentions that Homer in his
poems often lamented the same decline; and this he does not laugh at as
a poetical figment, but in his character of a recorder of natural
wonders accepts it as historically true.  But, as I said, the bones
which are from time to time discovered prove the size of the bodies of
the ancients, <span id="fr_800"></span>[801](#fn_800.md) and will do so to
future ages, for they are slow to decay.  But the length of an
antediluvian’s life cannot now be proved by any such monumental
evidence.  But we are not on this account to withhold our faith from the
sacred history, whose statements of past fact we are the more
inexcusable in discrediting, as we see the accuracy of its prediction of
what was future.  And even that same Pliny <span
id="fr_801"></span>[802](#fn_801.md) tells us that there is still a nation
in which men live 200 years.  If, then, in places unknown to us, men are
believed to have a length of days which is quite beyond our own
experience, why should we not believe the same of times distant from our
own?  Or are we to believe that in other places there is what is not
here, while we do not believe that in other times there has been
anything but what is now?
