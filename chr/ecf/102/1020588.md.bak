<span id="iv.XIX.15-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XIX.15-p1.1"></span>Chapter 15.—Of the Liberty Proper to Man’s
Nature, and the Servitude Introduced by Sin,—A Servitude in Which the
Man Whose Will is Wicked is the Slave of His Own Lust, Though He is Free
So Far as Regards Other Men.</span>

<span id="iv.XIX.15-p2"></span>This is prescribed by the order of
nature:  it is thus that God has created man.  For “let them,” He says,
“have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air,
and over every creeping thing which creepeth on the earth.” <span
id="fr_1283"></span>[1284](#fn_1283.md)   He did not intend that His
rational creature, who was made in His image, should have dominion over
anything but the irrational creation,—not man over man, but man over the
beasts.  And hence the righteous men in primitive times were made
shepherds of cattle rather than kings of men, God intending thus to
teach us what the relative position of the creatures is, and what the
desert of sin; for it is with justice, we believe, that the condition of
slavery is the result of sin.  And this is why we do not find the word
“slave” in any part of Scripture until righteous Noah branded the sin of
his son with this name.  It is a name, therefore, introduced by sin and
not by nature.  The origin of the Latin word for slave is supposed to be
found in the circumstance that those who by the law of war were liable
to be killed were sometimes preserved by their victors, and were hence
called servants. <span id="fr_1284"></span>[1285](#fn_1284.md)   And these
circumstances could never have arisen save through sin.  For even when
we wage a just war, our adversaries must be sinning; and every victory,
even though gained by wicked men, is a result of the first judgment of
God, who humbles the vanquished either for the sake of removing or of
punishing their sins.  Witness that man of God, Daniel, who, when he was
in captivity, confessed to God his own sins and the sins of his people,
and declares with pious grief that these were the cause of the
captivity. <span id="fr_1285"></span>[1286](#fn_1285.md)   The prime cause,
then, of slavery is sin, which brings man under the dominion of his
fellow,—that which does not happen save by the judgment of God, with
whom is no unrighteousness, and who knows how to award fit punishments
to every variety of offence.  But our Master in heaven says, “Every one
who doeth sin is the servant of sin.” <span
id="fr_1286"></span>[1287](#fn_1286.md)   And thus there are many wicked
masters who have religious men as their slaves, and who are yet
themselves in bondage; “for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he
brought in bondage.” <span id="fr_1287"></span>[1288](#fn_1287.md)   And
beyond question it is a happier thing to be the slave of a man than of a
lust; for even this very lust of ruling, to mention no others, lays
waste men’s hearts with the most ruthless dominion.  Moreover, when men
are subjected to one another in a peaceful order, the lowly position
does as much good to the servant as the proud position does harm to the
master.  But by nature, as God first created us, no one is the slave
either of man or of sin.  This servitude is, however, penal, and is
appointed by that law which enjoins the preservation of the natural
order and forbids its disturbance; for if nothing had been done in
violation of that law, there would have been nothing to restrain by
penal servitude.  And therefore the apostle admonishes slaves to be
subject to their masters, and to serve them heartily and with good-will,
so that, if they cannot be freed by their masters, they may themselves
make their slavery in some sort free, by serving not in crafty fear, but
in faithful love, until all unrighteousness pass away, and all
principality and every human power be brought to nothing, and God be all
in all.
