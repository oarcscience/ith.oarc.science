<span id="iv.XIV.22-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XIV.22-p1.1"></span>Chapter 22.—Of the Conjugal Union as It Was
Originally Instituted and Blessed by God.</span>

<span id="iv.XIV.22-p2"></span>But we, for our part, have no manner of
doubt that to increase and multiply and replenish the earth in virtue of
the blessing of God, is a gift of marriage as God instituted it from the
beginning before man sinned, when He created them male and female,—in
other words, two sexes manifestly distinct.  And it was this work of God
on which His blessing was pronounced.  For no sooner had Scripture said,
“Male and female created He them,” <span
id="fr_751"></span>[752](#fn_751) than it immediately continues, “And
God blessed them, and God said unto them, Increase, and multiply, and
replenish the earth, and subdue it,” etc.  And though all these things
may not unsuitably be interpreted in a spiritual sense, yet “male and
female” cannot be understood of two things in one man, as if there were
in him one thing which rules, another which is ruled; but it is quite
clear that they were created male and female, with bodies of different
sexes, for the very purpose of begetting offspring, and so increasing,
multiplying, and replenishing the earth; and it is great folly to oppose
so plain a fact.  It was not of the spirit which commands and the body
which obeys, nor of the rational soul which rules and the irrational
desire which is ruled, nor of the contemplative virtue which is supreme
and the active which is subject, nor of the understanding of the mind
and the sense of the body, but plainly of the matrimonial union by which
the sexes are mutually bound together, that our Lord, when asked whether
<span id="page_279">p. 279</span> <span id="iv.XIV.22-Page_279"></span>
it were lawful for any cause to put away one’s wife (for on account of
the hardness of the hearts of the Israelites Moses permitted a bill of
divorcement to be given), answered and said, “Have ye not read that He
which made them at the beginning made them male and female, and said,
For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to
his wife, and they twain shall be one flesh?  Wherefore they are no more
twain, but one flesh.  What, therefore, God hath joined together, let
not man put asunder.” <span id="fr_752"></span>[753](#fn_752)   It is
certain, then, that from the first men were created, as we see and know
them to be now, of two sexes, male and female, and that they are called
one, either on account of the matrimonial union, or on account of the
origin of the woman, who was created from the side of the man.  And it
is by this original example, which God Himself instituted, that the
apostle admonishes all husbands to love their own wives in
particular. <span id="fr_753"></span>[754](#fn_753)
