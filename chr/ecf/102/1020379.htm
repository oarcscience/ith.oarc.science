<p class="c21"><a name="iv.XIII.12-p2"></A>When, therefore, it is asked what death it was with which God threatened our first parents if they should transgress the commandment they had received from Him, and should fail to preserve their obedience,&#8212;whether it was the death of soul, or of body, or of the whole man, or that which is called second death,&#8212;we must answer, It is all.&#160; For the first consists of two; the second is the complete death, which consists of all.&#160; For, as the whole earth consists of many lands, and the Church universal of many churches, so death universal consists of all deaths.&#160; The first consists of two, one of the body, and another of the soul.&#160; So that the first death is a death of the whole man, since the soul without God and without the body suffers punishment for a time; but  <A NAME="page_251"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 251</FONT></A> <a name="iv.XIII.12-Page_251"></A>  the second is when the soul, without God but with the body, suffers punishment everlasting.&#160; When, therefore, God said to that first man whom he had placed in Paradise, referring to the forbidden fruit, &#8220;In the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_592"></A><A HREF="#fn_592"><FONT SIZE="1">593</FONT></A>
 that threatening included not only the first part of the first death, by which the soul is deprived of God; nor only the subsequent part of the first death, by which the body is deprived of the soul; nor only the whole first death itself, by which the soul is punished in separation from God and from the body;&#8212;but it includes whatever of death there is, even to that final death which is called second, and to which none is subsequent.</p>
