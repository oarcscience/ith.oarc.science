<span id="iv.XV.21-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XV.21-p1.1"></span>Chapter 21.—Why It is That, as Soon as Cain’s
Son Enoch Has Been Named, the Genealogy is Forthwith Continued as Far as
the Deluge, While After the Mention of Enos, Seth’s Son, the Narrative
Returns Again to the Creation of Man.</span>

<span id="iv.XV.21-p2"></span>We must first see why, in the enumeration
of Cain’s posterity, after Enoch, in whose name the city was built, has
been first of all mentioned, the rest are at once enumerated down to
that terminus of which I have spoken, and at which that race and the
whole line was destroyed in the deluge; while, after Enos the son of
Seth, has been mentioned, the rest are not at once named down to the
deluge, but a clause is inserted to the following effect:  “This is the
book of the generations of Adam.  In the day that God created man, in
the likeness of God made He him; male and female created He them; and
blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they were
created.” <span id="fr_834"></span>[835](#fn_834.md)   This seems to me to
be inserted for this purpose, that here again the reckoning of the times
may start from Adam himself—a purpose which the writer had not in view
in speaking of the earthly city, as if God mentioned it, but did not
take account of its duration.  But why does he return to this
recapitulation after mentioning the son of Seth, the man who hoped to
call on the name of the Lord God, unless because it was fit thus to
present these two cities, the one beginning with a murderer and ending
in a murderer (for Lamech, too, acknowledges to his two wives that he
had committed murder), the other built up by him who hoped to call upon
the name of the Lord God?  For the highest and complete terrestrial duty
of the city of God, which is a stranger in this world, is that which was
exemplified in the individual who was begotten by him who typified the
resurrection of the murdered Abel.  That one man is the unity of the
whole heavenly city, not yet indeed complete, but to be completed, as
this prophetic figure foreshows.  The son of Cain, therefore, that is,
the son of possession (and of what but an earthly possession?), may have
a name in the earthly city which was built in his name.  It is of such
the Psalmist says, “They call their lands after their own names.” <span
id="fr_835"></span>[836](#fn_835.md)   Wherefore they incur what is written
in another psalm:  “Thou, O Lord, in Thy city wilt despise their
image.” <span id="fr_836"></span>[837](#fn_836.md)   But as for the son of
Seth, the son of the resurrection, let him hope to call on the name of
the Lord God.  For he prefigures that society of men which says, “But I
am like a green olive-tree in the house of God:  I have trusted in the
mercy of God.” <span id="fr_837"></span>[838](#fn_837.md)   But let him not
seek the empty honors of a famous name upon earth, for “Blessed is the
man that maketh the name of the Lord his trust, and respecteth not
vanities nor lying follies.” <span id="fr_838"></span>[839](#fn_838.md)  
After having presented the two cities, the one founded in the material
good of this world, the other in hope in God, but both starting from a
common gate opened in Adam into this mortal state, and both running on
and running out to their proper and merited ends, Scripture begins to
reckon the times, and in this reckoning includes other generations,
making a recapitulation from Adam, out of whose condemned seed, as out
of one mass handed over to merited damnation, God made some vessels of
wrath to dishonor and others vessels of mercy to honor; in punishment
rendering to the former what is due, in grace giving to the latter what
is not due:  in order that by the very comparison of itself with the
vessels of wrath, the heavenly city, which sojourns on earth, may learn
not to put confidence in the liberty of its own will, but may hope to
call on the name of the Lord God.  For will, being a nature which was
made good by the good God, but mutable by the immutable, because it was
made out of nothing, can both decline from good to do evil, which takes
place when it freely chooses, and can also escape the evil and do good,
which takes place only by divine assistance.
