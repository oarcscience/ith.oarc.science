id="v.iv.xxxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 35.—The Fulfillment and End of
Scripture is the Love of God and Our Neighbor.</span>

<span id="v.iv.xxxv-p2"></span>39.  Of all, then, that has been said
since <span id="page_533">p. 533</span> <span
id="v.iv.xxxv-Page_533"></span> we entered upon the discussion about
things, this is the sum:  that we should clearly understand that the
fulfillment and the end of the Law, and of all Holy Scripture, is the
love of an object which is to be enjoyed, and the love of an object
which can enjoy that other in fellowship with ourselves.  For there is
no need of a command that each man should love himself.  The whole
temporal dispensation for our salvation, therefore, was framed by the
providence of God that we might know this truth and be able to act upon
it; and we ought to use that dispensation, not with such love and
delight as if it were a good to rest in, but with a transient feeling
rather, such as we have towards the road, or carriages, or other things
that are merely means.  Perhaps some other comparison can be found that
will more suitably express the idea that we are to love the things by
which we are borne only for the sake of that towards which we are borne.
