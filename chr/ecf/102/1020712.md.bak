id="v.iv.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 16.—Christ Purges His Church by
Medicinal Afflictions.</span>

<span id="v.iv.xvi-p2"></span>15.  For the Church is His body, as the
apostle’s teaching shows us; <span id="fr_1727"></span>[1728](#fn_1727.md)
and it is even called His spouse. <span
id="fr_1728"></span>[1729](#fn_1728.md)   His body, then, which has many
members, and all performing different functions, He holds together in
the bond of unity and love, which is its true health.  Moreover He
exercises it in the present time, and purges it with many wholesome
afflictions, that when He has transplanted it from this world to the
eternal world, He may take it to Himself as His bride, without spot or
wrinkle, or any such thing.
