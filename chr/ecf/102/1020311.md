<span id="iv.XI.7-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XI.7-p1.1"></span>Chapter 7.—Of the Nature of the First Days,
Which are Said to Have Had Morning and Evening, Before There Was a
Sun.</span>

<span id="iv.XI.7-p2"></span>We see, indeed, that our ordinary days have
no evening but by the setting, and no morning but by the rising, of the
sun; but the first three days of all were passed without sun, since it
is reported to have been made on the fourth day.  And first of all,
indeed, light was made by the word of God, and God, we read, separated
it from the darkness, and called the light Day, and the darkness Night;
but what kind of light that was, and by what periodic movement it made
evening and morning, is beyond the reach of our senses; neither can we
understand how it was, and yet must unhesitatingly believe it.  For
either it was some material light, whether proceeding from the upper
parts of the world, far removed from our sight, or from the spot where
the sun was afterwards kindled; or under the name of light the holy city
was signified, composed of holy angels and blessed spirits, the city of
which the apostle says, “Jerusalem which is above is our eternal <span
id="page_209">p. 209</span> <span id="iv.XI.7-Page_209"></span> mother
in heaven;” <span id="fr_458"></span>[459](#fn_458.md) and in another
place, “For ye are all the children of the light, and the children of
the day; we are not of the night, nor of darkness.” <span
id="fr_459"></span>[460](#fn_459.md)   Yet in some respects we may
appropriately speak of a morning and evening of this day also.  For the
knowledge of the creature is, in comparison of the knowledge of the
Creator, but a twilight; and so it dawns and breaks into morning when
the creature is drawn to the praise and love of the Creator; and night
never falls when the Creator is not forsaken through love of the
creature.  In fine, Scripture, when it would recount those days in
order, never mentions the word night.  It never says, “Night was,” but
“The evening and the morning were the first day.”  So of the second and
the rest.  And, indeed, the knowledge of created things contemplated by
themselves is, so to speak, more colorless than when they are seen in
the wisdom of God, as in the art by which they were made.  Therefore
evening is a more suitable figure than night; and yet, as I said,
morning returns when the creature returns to the praise and love of the
Creator.  When it does so in the knowledge of itself, that is the first
day; when in the knowledge of the firmament, which is the name given to
the sky between the waters above and those beneath, that is the second
day; when in the knowledge of the earth, and the sea, and all things
that grow out of the earth, that is the third day; when in the knowledge
of the greater and less luminaries, and all the stars, that is the
fourth day; when in the knowledge of all animals that swim in the waters
and that fly in the air, that is the fifth day; when in the knowledge of
all animals that live on the earth, and of man himself, that is the
sixth day. <span id="fr_460"></span>[461](#fn_460.md)
