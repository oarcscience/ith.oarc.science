<span id="iv.X.14-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.X.14-p1.1"></span>Chapter 14.—That the One God is to Be
Worshipped Not Only for the Sake of Eternal Blessings, But Also in
Connection with Temporal Prosperity, Because All Things are Regulated by
His Providence.</span>

<span id="iv.X.14-p2"></span>The education of the human race,
represented by the people of God, has advanced, like that of an
individual, through certain epochs, or, as it were, ages, so that it
might gradually rise from earthly to heavenly things, and from the
visible to the invisible.  This object was kept so clearly in view,
that, even in the period when temporal rewards were promised, the one
God was presented as the object of worship, that men might not
acknowledge any other than the true Creator and Lord of the spirit, even
in connection with the earthly blessings of this transitory life.  For
he who denies that all things, which either angels or men can give us,
are in the hand of the one Almighty, is a madman.  The Platonist
Plotinus discourses concerning providence, and, from the beauty of
flowers and foliage, proves that from the supreme God, whose beauty is
unseen and ineffable, providence reaches down even to these earthly
things here below; and he argues that all these frail and perishing
things could not have so exquisite and elaborate a beauty, were they not
fashioned by Him whose unseen and unchangeable beauty continually
pervades all things. <span id="fr_406"></span>[407](#fn_406.md)   This is
proved also by the Lord Jesus, where He says, “Consider the lilies, how
they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin.  And yet I say unto you
that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.  But if
God so clothe the grass of the field, which to-day is and to-morrow is
cast into the oven, how much more shall He clothe you, O ye of little
faith.!” <span id="fr_407"></span>[408](#fn_407.md)   It was best,
therefore, that the soul of man, which was still weakly desiring earthly
things, should be accustomed to seek from God alone even these petty
temporal boons, and the earthly necessaries of this transitory life,
which are contemptible in comparison with eternal blessings, in order
that the desire even of these things might not draw it aside from the
worship of Him, to whom we come by despising and forsaking such things.
