<span id="iv.XV.2-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XV.2-p1.1"></span>Chapter 2.—Of the Children of the Flesh and the
Children of the Promise.</span>

<span id="iv.XV.2-p2"></span>There was indeed on earth, so long as it
was needed, a symbol and foreshadowing image of this city, which served
the purpose of reminding men that such a city was to be rather than of
making it present; and this image was itself called the holy city, as a
symbol of the future city, though not itself the reality.  Of this city
which served as an image, and of that free city it typified, Paul writes
to the Galatians in these terms:  “Tell me, ye that desire to be under
the law, do ye not hear the law?  For it is written, that Abraham had
two sons, the one by a bond maid, the other by a free woman.  But he who
was of the bond woman was born after the flesh, but he of the free woman
was by promise.  Which things are an allegory: <span
id="fr_769"></span>[770](#fn_769.md)   for these are the two covenants; the
one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is Agar. 
For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to Jerusalem which
now is, and is in bondage with her children.  But Jerusalem which is
above is free, which is the mother of us all.  For it is written,
Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that
travailest not, for the desolate hath many more children than she which
hath an husband.  Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of
promise.  But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him
that was born after the Spirit, even so it is now.  Nevertheless, what
saith the Scripture?  Cast out the bond woman and her son:  for the son
of the bond woman shall not be heir with the son of the free woman.  And
we, brethren, are not children of the bond woman, but of the free, in
the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free.” <span
id="fr_770"></span>[771](#fn_770.md)   This interpretation of the passage,
handed down to us with apostolic authority, shows how we ought to
understand the Scriptures of the two covenants—the old and the new.  One
portion of the earthly city became an image of the heavenly city, not
having a significance of its own, but signifying another city, and
therefore serving, or “being in bondage.”  For it was founded not for
its own sake, but to prefigure another city; and this shadow of a city
was also itself foreshadowed by another preceding figure.  For Sarah’s
handmaid Agar, and her son, were an image of this image.  And as the
shadows were to pass away when the full light came, Sarah, the free
woman, who prefigured the free city (which again was also prefigured in
another way by that shadow of a city Jerusalem), therefore said, “Cast
out the bond woman and her son; for the son of the bond woman shall not
be heir with my son Isaac,” or, as the apostle says, “with the son of
the free woman.”  In the earthly city, then, we find two things—its own
obvious presence, and its symbolic presentation of the heavenly city. 
Now citizens are begotten to the earthly city by nature vitiated by sin,
but to the heavenly city by grace freeing nature from sin; whence the
former are called “vessels of wrath,” the latter “vessels of
mercy.” <span id="fr_771"></span>[772](#fn_771.md)   And this was typified
in the two sons of Abraham,—Ishmael, the son of Agar the handmaid, being
born according to the flesh, while Isaac was born of the free woman
Sarah, according to the promise.  Both, indeed, were of Abraham’s seed;
but the one was begotten by natural law, the other was given by gracious
promise.  In the one birth, human action is revealed; in the other, a
divine kindness comes to light.
