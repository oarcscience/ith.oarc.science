<span id="iv.XVI.32-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XVI.32-p1.1"></span>Chapter 32.—Of Abraham’s Obedience and Faith,
Which Were Proved by the Offering Up, of His Son in Sacrifice, and of
Sarah’s Death.</span>

<span id="iv.XVI.32-p2"></span>Among other things, of which it would
take too long time to mention the whole, Abraham was tempted about the
offering up of his well-beloved son Isaac, to prove his pious obedience,
and so make it known to the world, not to God.  Now every temptation is
not blame-worthy; it may even be praise-worthy, because it furnishes
probation.  And, for the most part, the human mind cannot attain to
self-knowledge otherwise than by making trial of its powers through
temptation, by some kind of experimental and not merely verbal
self-interrogation; when, if it has acknowledged the gift of God, it is
pious, and is consolidated by steadfast grace and not puffed up by vain
boasting.  Of course Abraham could never believe that God delighted in
human sacrifices; yet when the divine commandment thundered, it was to
be obeyed, not disputed.  Yet Abraham is worthy of praise, because he
all along believed that his son, on being offered up, would rise again;
for God had said to him, when he was unwilling to fulfill his wife’s
pleasure by casting out the bond maid and her son, “In Isaac shall thy
seed be called.”  No doubt He then goes on to say, “And as for the son
of this bond woman, I will make him a great nation, because he is thy
seed.” <span id="fr_939"></span>[940](#fn_939.md)   How then is it said “In
Isaac shall thy seed be called,” when God calls Ishmael also his seed? 
The apostle, in explaining this, says, “In Isaac shall thy seed be
called, that is, they which are the children of the flesh, these are not
the children of God:  but the children of the promise are counted for
the seed.” <span id="fr_940"></span>[941](#fn_940.md)   In order, then,
that the children of the promise may be the seed of Abraham, they are
called in Isaac, that is, are gathered together in Christ by the call of
grace.  Therefore the father, holding fast from the first the promise
which behoved to be fulfilled through this son whom God had ordered him
to slay, did not doubt that he whom he once thought it hopeless he
should ever receive would be restored to him when he had offered him
up.  It is in this way the passage in the Epistle to the Hebrews is also
to be understood and explained.  “By faith,” he says, “Abraham overcame,
when tempted about Isaac:  and he who had received the promise offered
up his only son, to whom it was said, In Isaac shall thy seed be
called:  thinking that God was able to raise him up, even from the
dead;” therefore he has added, “from whence also he received him in a
similitude.” <span id="fr_941"></span>[942](#fn_941.md)   In whose
similitude but His of whom the apostle says, “He that spared not His own
Son, but delivered Him up for us all?” <span
id="fr_942"></span>[943](#fn_942.md)   And on this account Isaac also
himself carried to the place of sacrifice the wood on which he was to be
offered up, just as the Lord Himself carried His own cross.  Finally,
since Isaac was not to be slain, after his father was forbidden to smite
him, who was that ram by the offering of which that sacrifice was
completed with typical blood?  For when Abraham saw him, he was caught
by the horns in a thicket.  What, then, did he represent but Jesus, who,
before He was offered up, was crowned with thorns by the Jews?

<span id="iv.XVI.32-p7"></span>But let us rather hear the divine words
spoken through the angel.  For the Scripture says, “And Abraham
stretched forth his hand to take the knife, that he might slay his son. 
And the Angel of the Lord called unto him from heaven, and said,
Abraham.  And he said, Here am I.  And he said, Lay not thine hand upon
the lad, neither do thou anything unto him:  for now I know that thou
fearest God, and hast not spared thy beloved son for my sake.” <span
id="fr_943"></span>[944](#fn_943.md)   It is said, “Now I know,” that is,
Now I have made to be known; for God was not previously ignorant of
this.  Then, having offered up that ram instead of Isaac his son,
“Abraham,” as we read, “called the name of that place The Lord seeth: 
as they say this day, In the mount the Lord hath appeared.” <span
id="fr_944"></span>[945](#fn_944.md)   As it is said, “Now I know,” for Now
I have made to be known, so here, “The Lord sees,” for The Lord hath
appeared, that is, made Himself to be seen.  “And the Angel of the Lord
called unto Abraham from heaven the second time, saying, By myself have
I sworn, saith the Lord; because thou hast done this thing, and hast not
spared thy beloved son for my sake; that in blessing I will bless thee,
and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and
as the sand which is upon the seashore; and thy seed shall possess by
inheritance the cities of the adversaries:  and in thy seed shall all
the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou <span id="page_330">p.
330</span> <span id="iv.XVI.32-Page_330"></span> hast obeyed my
voice.” <span id="fr_945"></span>[946](#fn_945.md)   In this manner is that
promise concerning the calling of the nations in the seed of Abraham
confirmed even by the oath of God, after that burnt-offering which
typified Christ.  For He had often promised, but never sworn.  And what
is the oath of God, the true and faithful, but a confirmation of the
promise, and a certain reproof to the unbelieving?

<span id="iv.XVI.32-p11"></span>After these things Sarah died, in the
127th year of her life, and the 137th of her husband for he was ten
years older than she, as he himself says, when a son is promised to him
by her:  “Shall a son be born to me that am an hundred years old? and
shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?” <span
id="fr_946"></span>[947](#fn_946.md)   Then Abraham bought a field, in
which he buried his wife.  And then, according to Stephen’s account, he
was settled in that land, entering then on actual possession of it,—that
is, after the death of his father, who is inferred to have died two
years before.
