<span id="iv.VII.12-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.VII.12-p1.1"></span>Chapter 12.—That Jupiter is Also Called
Pecunia.</span>

<span id="iv.VII.12-p2"></span>How elegantly they have accounted for
this name!  “He is also called Pecunia,” say they, “because all things
belong to him.”  Oh how grand an explanation of the name of a deity! 
Yes; he to whom all things belong is most meanly and most contumeliously
called Pecunia.  In comparison of all things which are contained by
heaven and earth, what are all things together which are possessed by
men under the name of money? <span id="fr_273"></span>[274](#fn_273)  
And this name, forsooth, hath avarice given to Jupiter, that whoever was
a lover of money might seem to himself to love not an ordinary god, but
the very king of all things himself.  But it would be a far different
thing if he had been called Riches.  For riches are one thing, money
another.  For we call rich the wise, the just, the good, who have either
no money or very little.  For they are more truly rich in possessing
virtue, since by it, even as re <span id="page_130">p. 130</span> <span
id="iv.VII.12-Page_130"></span> spects things necessary for the body,
they are content with what they have.  But we call the greedy poor, who
are always craving and always wanting.  For they may possess ever so
great an amount of money; but whatever be the abundance of that, they
are not able but to want.  And we properly call God Himself rich; not,
however, in money, but in omnipotence.  Therefore they who have
abundance of money are called rich, but inwardly needy if they are
greedy.  So also, those who have no money are called poor, but inwardly
rich if they are wise.

<span id="iv.VII.12-p4"></span>What, then, ought the wise man to think
of this theology, in which the king of the gods receives the name of
that thing “which no wise man has desired?” <span
id="fr_274"></span>[275](#fn_274)   For had there been anything
wholesomely taught by this philosophy concerning eternal life, how much
more appropriately would that god who is the ruler of the world have
been called by them, not money, but wisdom, the love of which purges
from the filth of avarice, that is, of the love of money!
