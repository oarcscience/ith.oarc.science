Scripture in Which Approval is Expressed of Actions Which are Now
Condemned by Good Men.</span>

<span id="v.vi.xxii-p2"></span>32.  Therefore, although all, or nearly
all, the transactions recorded in the Old Testament are to be taken not
literally only, but figuratively as well, nevertheless even in the case
of those which the reader has taken literally, and which, though the
authors of them are praised, are repugnant to the habits of the good men
who since our Lord’s advent are the custodians of the divine commands,
let him refer the figure to its interpretation, but let him not transfer
the act to his habits of life.  For many things which were done as
duties at that time, cannot now be done except through lust.
