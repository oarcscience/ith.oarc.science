<span id="iv.XVI.28-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XVI.28-p1.1"></span>Chapter 28.—Of the Change of Name in Abraham
and Sarah, Who Received the Gift of Fecundity When They Were Incapable
of Regeneration Owing to the Barrenness of One, and the Old Age of
Both.</span>

<span id="iv.XVI.28-p2"></span>Now when a promise so great and clear was
made to Abraham, in which it was so plainly said to him, “I have made
thee a father of many nations, and I will increase thee exceedingly, and
I will make nations of thee, and kings shall go forth of thee.  And I
will give thee a son of Sarah; and I will bless him, and he shall become
nations, and kings of nations shall be of him,” <span
id="fr_927"></span>[928](#fn_927.md) —a promise which we now see fulfilled
in Christ,—from that time forward this couple are not called in
Scripture, as formerly, Abram and Sarai, but Abraham and Sarah, as we
have called them from the first, for every one does so now.  The reason
why the name of Abraham was changed is given:  “For,” He says, “I have
made thee a father of many nations.”  This, then, is to be understood to
be the meaning of *Abraham*; but *Abram*, as he was formerly called,
means “exalted father.”  The reason of the change of Sarah’s name is not
given; but as those say who have written interpretations of the Hebrew
names contained in these books, Sarah means “my princess,” and Sarai
“strength.”  Whence it is written in the Epistle to the Hebrews,
“Through faith also Sarah herself received strength to conceive
seed.” <span id="fr_928"></span>[929](#fn_928.md)   For both were old, as
the Scripture testifies; but she was also barren, and had ceased to
menstruate, so that she could no longer bear children even if she had
not been barren.  Further, if a woman is advanced in years, yet still
retains the custom of women, she can bear children to a young man, but
not to an old man, although that same old man can beget, but only of a
young woman; as after Sarah’s death Abraham could of Keturah, because he
met with her in her lively age.  This, then, is what the apostle
mentions as wonderful, saying, besides, that Abraham’s body was now
dead; <span id="fr_929"></span>[930](#fn_929.md) because at that age he was
no longer able to beget children of any woman who retained now only a
small part of her natural vigor.  Of course we must understand that his
body was dead only to some purposes, not to all; for if it was so to
all, it would no longer be the aged body of a living man, but the corpse
of a dead one.  Although that question, how Abraham begot children of
Keturah, is usually solved in this way, that the gift of begetting which
he received from the Lord, remained even after the death of his wife,
yet I think that solution of the question which I have followed is
preferable, because, although in our days an old man of a hundred years
can beget children of no woman, it was not so then, when men still lived
so long that a hundred years did not yet bring on them the decrepitude
of old age.
