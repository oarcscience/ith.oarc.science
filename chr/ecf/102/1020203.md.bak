id="iv.VII.20-p1.1"></span>Chapter 20.—Concerning the Rites of
Eleusinian Ceres.</span>

<span id="iv.VII.20-p2"></span>Now among the rites of Ceres, those
Eleusinian rites are much famed which were in the highest repute among
the Athenians, of which Varro offers no interpretation except with
respect to corn, which Ceres discovered, and with respect to Proserpine,
whom Ceres lost, Orcus having carried her away.  And this Proserpine
herself, he says, signifies the fecundity of seeds.  But as this
fecundity departed at a certain season, whilst the earth wore an aspect
of sorrow through the consequent sterility, there arose an opinion that
the daughter of Ceres, that is, fecundity itself, who was called
Proserpine, from *proserpere* (to creep forth, to spring), had been
carried away by Orcus, and detained among the inhabitants of the nether
world; which circumstance was celebrated with public mourning.  But
since the same fecundity again returned, there arose joy because
Proserpine had been given back by Orcus, and thus these rites were
instituted.  Then Varro adds, that many things are taught in the
mysteries of Ceres which only refer to the discovery of fruits.
