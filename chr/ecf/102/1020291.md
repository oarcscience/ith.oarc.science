id="iv.X.20-p1.1"></span>Chapter 20.—Of the Supreme and True Sacrifice
Which Was Effected by the Mediator Between God and Men.</span>

<span id="iv.X.20-p2"></span>And hence that true Mediator, in so far as,
by assuming the form of a servant, He became the Mediator between God
and men, the man Christ Jesus, though in the form of God He received
sacrifice together with the Father, with whom He is one God, yet in the
form of a servant He chose rather to be than to receive a sacrifice,
that not even by this instance any one might have occasion to suppose
that sacrifice should be rendered to any creature.  Thus He is both the
Priest who offers and the Sacrifice offered.  And He designed that there
should be a daily sign of this in the sacrifice of the Church, which,
being His body, learns to offer herself through Him.  Of this true
Sacrifice the ancient sacrifices of the saints were the various and
numerous signs; and it was thus variously figured, just as one thing is
signified by a variety of words, that there may be less weariness when
we speak of it much.  To this supreme and true sacrifice all false
sacrifices have given place.
