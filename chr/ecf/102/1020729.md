<span id="v.iv.xxxiii-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="v.iv.xxxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 33.—In What Way Man Should Be
Enjoyed.</span>

<span id="v.iv.xxxiii-p2"></span>36.  For if we find our happiness
complete in one another, we stop short upon the road, and place our hope
of happiness in man or angel.  Now the proud man and the proud angel
arrogate this to themselves, and are glad to have the hope of others
fixed upon them.  But, on the contrary, the holy man and the holy angel,
even when we are weary and anxious to stay with them and rest in them,
set themselves to recruit our energies with the provision which they
have received of God for us or for themselves; and then urge us thus
refreshed to go on our way towards Him, in the enjoyment of whom we find
our common happiness.  For even the apostle exclaims, “Was Paul
crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?” <span
id="fr_1744"></span>[1745](#fn_1744) and again:  “Neither is he that
planteth anything, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the
increase.” <span id="fr_1745"></span>[1746](#fn_1745)   And the angel
admonisheth the man who is about to worship him, that he should rather
worship Him who is his Master, and under whom he himself is a
fellow-servant. <span id="fr_1746"></span>[1747](#fn_1746)

<span id="v.iv.xxxiii-p6"></span>37.  But when you have joy of a man in
God, it is God rather than man that you enjoy.  For you enjoy Him by
whom you are made happy, and you rejoice to have come to Him in whose
presence you place your hope of joy.  And accordingly, Paul says to
Philemon, “Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord.” <span
id="fr_1747"></span>[1748](#fn_1747)   For if he had not added “in the
Lord,” but had only said, “Let me have joy of thee,” he would have
implied that he fixed his hope of happiness upon him, although even in
the immediate context to “enjoy” is used in the sense of to “use with
delight.”  For when the thing that we love is near us, it is a matter of
course that it should bring delight with it.  And if you pass beyond
this delight, and make it a means to that which you are permanently to
rest in, you are using it, and it is an abuse of language to say that
you enjoy it.  But if you cling to it, and rest in it, finding your
happiness complete in it, then you may be truly and properly said to
enjoy it.  And this we must never do except in the case of the Blessed
Trinity, who is the Supreme and Unchangeable Good.
