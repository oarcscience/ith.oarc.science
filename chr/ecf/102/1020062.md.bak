<span id="iv.II_1.19-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.II_1.19-p1.1"></span>Chapter 19.—Of the Corruption Which Had
Grown Upon the Roman Republic Before Christ Abolished the Worship of the
Gods.</span>

<span id="iv.II_1.19-p2"></span>Here, then, is this Roman republic,
“which has changed little by little from the fair and virtuous city it
was, and has become utterly wicked and dissolute.”  It is not I who am
the first to say this, but their own authors, from whom we learned it
for a fee, and who wrote it long before the coming of Christ.  You see
how, before the coming of Christ, and after the destruction of Carthage,
“the primitive manners, instead of undergoing insensible alteration, as
hitherto they had done, were swept away as by a torrent; and how
depraved by luxury and avarice the youth were.”  Let them now, on their
part, read to us any laws given by their gods to the Roman people, and
directed against luxury and avarice.  And would that they had only been
silent on the subjects of chastity and modesty, and had not demanded
from the people indecent and shameful practices, to which they lent a
pernicious patronage by their so-called divinity.  Let them read our
commandments <span id="page_34">p. 34</span> <span
id="iv.II_1.19-Page_34"></span> in the Prophets, Gospels, Acts of the
Apostles or Epistles; let them peruse the large number of precepts
against avarice and luxury which are everywhere read to the
congregations that meet for this purpose, and which strike the ear, not
with the uncertain sound of a philosophical discussion, but with the
thunder of God’s own oracle pealing from the clouds.  And yet they do
not impute to their gods the luxury and avarice, the cruel and dissolute
manners, that had rendered the republic utterly wicked and corrupt, even
before the coming of Christ; but whatever affliction their pride and
effeminacy have exposed them to in these latter days, they furiously
impute to our religion.  If the kings of the earth and all their
subjects, if all princes and judges of the earth, if young men and
maidens, old and young, every age, and both sexes; if they whom the
Baptist addressed, the publicans and the soldiers, were all together to
hearken to and observe the precepts of the Christian religion regarding
a just and virtuous life, then should the republic adorn the whole earth
with its own felicity, and attain in life everlasting to the pinnacle of
kingly glory.  But because this man listens and that man scoffs, and
most are enamored of the blandishments of vice rather than the wholesome
severity of virtue, the people of Christ, whatever be their
condition—whether they be kings, princes, judges, soldiers, or
provincials, rich or poor, bond or free, male or female—are enjoined to
endure this earthly republic, wicked and dissolute as it is, that so
they may by this endurance win for themselves an eminent place in that
most holy and august assembly of angels and republic of heaven, in which
the will of God is the law.
