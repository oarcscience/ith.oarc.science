<p class="c34"><a name="iv.XI.32-p1"></A><span class="c2"><a name="iv.XI.32-p1.1"></A>Chapter 32.&#8212;Of the Opinion that the Angels Were Created Before the World.</span></p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="iv.XI.32-p2"></A>But if some one oppose our opinion, and say that the holy angels are not referred to when it is said, &#8220;Let there be light, and there was light;&#8221; if he suppose or teach that some material light, then first created, was meant, and that the angels were created, not only before the firmament dividing the waters and named &#8220;the heaven,&#8221; but also before the time signified in the words, &#8220;In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth;&#8221; if he allege that this phrase, &#8220;In the beginning,&#8221; does not mean that nothing was made before (for the angels were), but that God made all things by His Wisdom or Word, who is named in Scripture &#8220;the Beginning,&#8221; as He Himself, in the gospel, replied to the Jews when they asked Him who He was, that He was the Beginning;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_510"></A><A HREF="#fn_510"><FONT SIZE="1">511</FONT></A>
&#8212;I will not contest the point, chiefly because it gives me the liveliest satisfaction to find the Trinity celebrated in the very beginning of the book of Genesis.&#160; For having said &#8220;In the Beginning God created the heaven and the earth,&#8221; meaning that the Father made them in the Son (as the psalm testifies where it says, &#8220;How manifold are Thy works, O Lord! in Wisdom hast Thou made them all&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_511"></A><A HREF="#fn_511"><FONT SIZE="1">512</FONT></A>
), a little afterwards mention is fitly made of the Holy Spirit also.&#160; For, when it had been told us what kind of earth God created at first, or what the mass or matter was which God, under the name of &#8220;heaven and earth,&#8221; had provided for the construction of the world, as is told in the additional words, &#8220;And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep,&#8221; then, for the sake of completing the mention of the Trinity, it is immediately added, &#8220;And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.&#8221;&#160; Let  <A NAME="page_224"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 224</FONT></A> <a name="iv.XI.32-Page_224"></A>  each one, then, take it as he pleases; for it is so profound a passage, that it may well suggest, for the exercise of the reader&#146;s tact, many opinions, and none of them widely departing from the rule of faith.&#160; At the same time, let none doubt that the holy angels in their heavenly abodes are, though not, indeed, co-eternal with God, yet secure and certain of eternal and true felicity.&#160; To their company the Lord teaches that His little ones belong; and not only says, &#8220;They shall be equal to the angels of God,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_512"></A><A HREF="#fn_512"><FONT SIZE="1">513</FONT></A>
 but shows, too, what blessed contemplation the angels themselves enjoy, saying, &#8220;Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones:&#160; for I say unto you, that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_513"></A><A HREF="#fn_513"><FONT SIZE="1">514</FONT></A>
