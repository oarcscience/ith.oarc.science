<p class="c34"><a name="iv.XIX.1-p1"></A><span class="c2"><a name="iv.XIX.1-p1.1"></A>Chapter 1.&#8212;That Varro Has Made Out that Two Hundred and Eighty-Eight Different Sects of Philosophy Might Be Formed by the Various Opinions Regarding the Supreme Good.</span></p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="iv.XIX.1-p2"></A><span class="c11"><a name="iv.XIX.1-p2.1"></A>As</span> I see that I have still to discuss the fit destinies of the two cities, the earthly and the heavenly, I must first explain, so far as the limits of this work allow me, the reasonings by which men have attempted to make for themselves a happiness in this unhappy life, in order that it may be evident, not only from divine authority, but also from such reasons as can be adduced to unbelievers, how the empty dreams of the philosophers differ from the hope which God gives to us, and from the substantial fulfillment of it which He will give us as our blessedness.&#160; Philosophers have expressed a great variety of diverse opinions regarding the ends of goods and of evils, and this question they have eagerly canvassed, that they might, if possible, discover what makes a man happy.&#160; For the end of our good is that for the sake of which other things are to be desired, while it is to be desired for its own sake; and the end of evil is that on account of which other things are to be shunned, while it is avoided on its own account.&#160; Thus, by the <i>end of good</i>, we at present mean, not that by which good is destroyed, so that it no longer exists, but that by which it is finished, so that it becomes complete; and by the <i>end of evil</i> we mean, not that which abolishes it, but that which completes its development.&#160; These two ends, therefore, are the supreme good and the supreme evil; and, as I have said, those who have in this vain life professed the study of wisdom have been at great pains to discover these ends, and to obtain the supreme good and avoid the supreme evil in this life.&#160; And although they erred in a variety of ways, yet natural insight has prevented them from wandering from the truth so far that they have not placed the supreme good and evil, some in the soul, some in the body, and some in both.&#160; From this tripartite distribution of the sects of philosophy, Marcus Varro, in his book <i>De Philosophia</i>,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1258"></A><A HREF="#fn_1258"><FONT SIZE="1">1259</FONT></A>
 has drawn so large a variety of opinions, that, by a subtle and minute analysis of distinctions, he numbers without difficulty as many as 288 sects,&#8212;not that these have actually existed, but sects which are possible.</p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="iv.XIX.1-p4"></A>To illustrate briefly what he means, I must begin with his own introductory statement in the above-mentioned book, that there are four things which men desire, as it were by nature without a master, without the help of any instruction, without industry or the art of living which is called virtue, and which is certainly learned:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1259"></A><A HREF="#fn_1259"><FONT SIZE="1">1260</FONT></A>
&#160; either pleasure, which is an agreeable stirring of the bodily sense; or repose, which excludes every bodily inconvenience; or both these, which Epicurus calls by the one name, pleasure; or the primary objects  <A NAME="page_398"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 398</FONT></A> <a name="iv.XIX.1-Page_398"></A>  of nature,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1260"></A><A HREF="#fn_1260"><FONT SIZE="1">1261</FONT></A>
 which comprehend the things already named and other things, either bodily, such as health, and safety, and integrity of the members, or spiritual, such as the greater and less mental gifts that are found in men.&#160; Now these four things&#8212;pleasure, repose, the two combined, and the primary objects of nature&#8212;exist in us in such sort that we must either desire virtue on their account, or them for the sake of virtue, or both for their own sake; and consequently there arise from this distinction twelve sects, for each is by this consideration tripled.&#160; I will illustrate this in one instance, and, having done so, it will not be difficult to understand the others.&#160; According, then, as bodily pleasure is subjected, preferred, or united to virtue, there are three sects.&#160; It is subjected to virtue when it is chosen as subservient to virtue.&#160; Thus it is a duty of virtue to live for one&#146;s country, and for its sake to beget children, neither of which can be done without bodily pleasure.&#160; For there is pleasure in eating and drinking, pleasure also in sexual intercourse.&#160; But when it is preferred to virtue, it is desired for its own sake, and virtue is chosen only for its sake, and to effect nothing else than the attainment or preservation of bodily pleasure.&#160; And this, indeed, is to make life hideous; for where virtue is the slave of pleasure it no longer deserves the name of virtue.&#160; Yet even this disgraceful distortion has found some philosophers to patronize and defend it.&#160; Then virtue is united to pleasure when neither is desired for the other&#146;s sake, but both for their own.&#160; And therefore, as pleasure, according as it is subjected, preferred, or united to virtue, makes three sects, so also do repose, pleasure and repose combined, and the prime natural blessings, make their three sects each.&#160; For as men&#146;s opinions vary, and these four things are sometimes subjected, sometimes preferred, and sometimes united to virtue, there are produced twelve sects.&#160; But this number again is doubled by the addition of one difference, viz., the social life; for whoever attaches himself to any of these sects does so either for his own sake alone, or for the sake of a companion, for whom he ought to wish what he desires for himself.&#160; And thus there will be twelve of those who think some one of these opinions should be held for their own sakes, and other twelve who decide that they ought to follow this or that philosophy not for their own sakes only, but also for the sake of others whose good they desire as their own.&#160; These twenty-four sects again are doubled, and become forty-eight by adding a difference taken from the New Academy.&#160; For each of these four and twenty sects can hold and defend their opinion as certain, as the Stoics defended the position that the supreme good of man consisted solely in virtue; or they can be held as probable, but not certain, as the New Academics did.&#160; There are, therefore, twenty-four who hold their philosophy as certainly true, other twenty-four who hold their opinions as probable, but not certain.&#160; Again, as each person who attaches himself to any of these sects may adopt the mode of life either of the Cynics or of the other philosophers, this distinction will double the number, and so make ninety-six sects.&#160; Then, lastly, as each of these sects may be adhered to either by men who love a life of ease, as those who have through choice or necessity addicted themselves to study, or by men who love a busy life, as those who, while philosophizing, have been much occupied with state affairs and public business, or by men who choose a mixed life, in imitation of those who have apportioned their time partly to erudite leisure, partly to necessary business:&#160; by these differences the number of the sects is tripled, and becomes 288.</p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="iv.XIX.1-p7"></A>I have thus, as briefly and lucidly as I could, given in my own words the opinions which Varro expresses in his book.&#160; But how he refutes all the rest of these sects, and chooses one, the Old Academy, instituted by Plato, and continuing to Polemo, the fourth teacher of that school of philosophy which held that their system was certain; and how on this ground he distinguishes it from the New Academy,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1261"></A><A HREF="#fn_1261"><FONT SIZE="1">1262</FONT></A>
 which began with Polemo&#146;s successor Arcesilaus, and held that all things are uncertain; and how he seeks to establish that the Old Academy was as free from error as from doubt,&#8212;all this, I say, were too long to enter upon in detail, and yet I must not altogether pass it by in silence.&#160; Varro then rejects, as a first step, all those differences which have multiplied the number of sects; and the ground on which he does so is that they are not differences about the supreme good.&#160; He maintains that in philosophy a sect is created only by its having an opinion of its own different from other schools on the point of the ends-in-chief.&#160; For man has no other reason for philosophizing than that he may be happy; but that which makes him happy is itself the supreme good.&#160; In other words, the supreme good is the reason of philosophizing; and therefore that cannot be called a sect of philosophy which pursues no way of its own towards the supreme good.&#160; Thus, when it is  <A NAME="page_399"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 399</FONT></A> <a name="iv.XIX.1-Page_399"></A>  asked whether a wise man will adopt the social life, and desire and be interested in the supreme good of his friend as in his own, or will, on the contrary, do all that he does merely for his own sake, there is no question here about the supreme good, but only about the propriety of associating or not associating a friend in its participation:&#160; whether the wise man will do this not for his own sake, but for the sake of his friend in whose good he delights as in his own.&#160; So, too, when it is asked whether all things about which philosophy is concerned are to be considered uncertain, as by the New Academy, or certain, as the other philosophers maintain, the question here is not what end should be pursued, but whether or not we are to believe in the substantial existence of that end; or, to put it more plainly, whether he who pursues the supreme good must maintain that it is a true good, or only that it appears to him to be true, though possibly it may be delusive,&#8212;both pursuing one and the same good.&#160; The distinction, too, which is founded on the dress and manners of the Cynics, does not touch the question of the chief good, but only the question whether he who pursues that good which seems to himself true should live as do the Cynics.&#160; There were, in fact, men who, though they pursued different things as the supreme good, some choosing pleasure, others virtue, yet adopted that mode of life which gave the Cynics their name.&#160; Thus, whatever it is which distinguishes the Cynics from other philosophers, this has no bearing on the choice and pursuit of that good which constitutes happiness.&#160; For if it had any such bearing, then the same habits of life would necessitate the pursuit of the same chief good, and diverse habits would necessitate the pursuit of different ends.</p>
