<span id="iv.XVIII.21-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XVIII.21-p1.1"></span>Chapter 21.—Of the Kings of Latium, the
First and Twelfth of Whom, Æneas and Aventinus, Were Made Gods.</span>

<span id="iv.XVIII.21-p2"></span>After Æneas, whom they deified, Latium
had eleven kings, none of whom was deified.  But Aventinus, who was the
twelfth after Æneas, having been laid low in war, and buried in that
hill still called by his name, was added to the number of such gods as
they made for themselves.  Some, indeed, were unwilling to write that he
was slain in battle, but said he was nowhere to be found, and that it
was not from his name, but from the alighting of birds, that hill was
called Aventinus. <span id="fr_1143"></span>[1144](#fn_1143.md)   After
this no god was made in Latium except Romulus the founder of Rome.  But
two kings are found between these two, the first of whom I shall
describe in the Virgilian verse:

<span id="iv.XVIII.21-p4"></span>“Next came that Procas, glory of the
Trojan race.” <span id="fr_1144"></span>[1145](#fn_1144.md)

<span id="iv.XVIII.21-p6"></span>That greatest of all kingdoms, the
Assyrian, had its long duration brought to a close in his time, the time
of Rome’s birth drawing nigh.  For the Assyrian empire was transferred
to the Medes after nearly thirteen hundred and five years, if we include
the reign of Belus, who begot Ninus, and, content with a small kingdom,
was the first king there.  Now Procas reigned before Amulius.  And
Amulius had made his brother Numitor’s daughter, Rhea by name, who was
also called Ilia, a vestal virgin, who conceived twin sons by Mars, as
they <span id="page_372">p. 372</span> <span
id="iv.XVIII.21-Page_372"></span> will have it, in that way honoring or
excusing her adultery, adding as a proof that a she-wolf nursed the
infants when exposed.  For they think this kind of beast belongs to Mars
so that the she-wolf is believed to have given her teats to the infants,
because she knew they were the sons of Mars her lord; although there are
not wanting persons who say that when the crying babes lay exposed, they
were first of all picked up by I know not what harlot, and sucked her
breasts first (now harlots were called *lupæ*, she-wolves, from which
their vile abodes are even yet called *lupanaria*), and that afterwards
they came into the hands of the shepherd Faustulus, and were nursed by
Acca his wife.  Yet what wonder is it, if, to rebuke the king who had
cruelly ordered them to be thrown into the water, God was pleased, after
divinely delivering them from the water, to succor, by means of a wild
beast giving milk, these infants by whom so great a city was to be
founded?  Amulius was succeeded in the Latian kingdom by his brother
Numitor, the grandfather of Romulus; and Rome was founded in the first
year of this Numitor, who from that time reigned along with his grandson
Romulus.
