<span id="iv.X.29-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.X.29-p1.1"></span>Chapter 29.—Of the Incarnation of Our Lord
Jesus Christ, Which the Platonists in Their Impiety Blush to
Acknowledge.</span>

<span id="iv.X.29-p2"></span>You proclaim the Father and His Son, whom
you call the Father’s intellect or mind, and between these a third, by
whom we suppose you mean the Holy Spirit, and in your own fashion you
call these three Gods.  In this, though your expressions are inaccurate,
you do in some sort, and as through a veil, see what we should strive
towards; but the incarnation of the unchangeable Son of God, whereby we
are saved, and are enabled to reach the things we believe, or in part
understand, this is what you refuse to recognize.  You see in a fashion,
although at a distance, although with filmy eye, the country in which we
should abide; but the way to it you know not.  Yet you believe in grace,
for you say it is granted to few to reach God by virtue of
intelligence.  For you do not say, “Few have thought fit or have
wished,” but, “It has been granted to few,”—distinctly acknowledging
God’s grace, not man’s sufficiency.  You also use this word more
expressly, when, in accordance with the opinion of Plato, you make no
doubt that in this life a man cannot by any means attain to perfect
wisdom, but that whatever is lacking is in the future life made up to
those who live intellectually, by God’s providence and grace.  Oh, had
you but recognized the grace of God in Jesus Christ our Lord, and that
very incarnation of His, wherein He assumed a human soul and body, you
might have seemed the brightest example of grace! <span
id="fr_430"></span>[431](#fn_430.md)   But what am I doing?  I know it is
useless to speak to a dead man,—useless, at least, so far as regards
you, but perhaps not in vain for those who esteem you highly, and love
you on account of their love of wisdom or curiosity about those arts
which you ought not to have learned; and these persons I address in your
name.  The grace of God could not have been more graciously commended to
us than thus, that the only Son of God, remaining unchangeable in
Himself, should assume humanity, and should give us the hope of His
love, by means of the mediation of a human nature, through which we,
from the condition of men, might come to Him who was so far off,—the
immortal from the mortal; the unchangeable from the changeable; the just
from the unjust; the blessed from the wretched.  And, as He had given us
a natural instinct to desire blessedness and immortality, He Himself
continuing to be blessed; but assuming mortality, by enduring what we
fear, taught us to despise it, that what we long for He might bestow
upon us.

<span id="iv.X.29-p4"></span>But in order to your acquiescence in this
truth, it is lowliness that is requisite, and to this it is extremely
difficult to bend you.  For what is there incredible, especially to men
like you, accustomed to speculation, which might have predisposed you to
believe in this,—what is there incredible, I say, in the assertion that
God assumed a human soul and body?  You yourselves ascribe such
excellence to the intellectual soul, which is, after all, the human
soul, that you maintain that it can become consubstantial with that
intelligence of the Father whom you believe in as the Son of God.  What
incredible thing is it, then, if some one soul be assumed by Him in an
ineffable and unique manner for the salvation of many?  Moreover, our
nature itself testifies that a man is incomplete unless a body be united
with the soul.  This certainly would be more incredible, were it not of
all things the most common; for we should more easily believe in a union
between spirit and spirit, or, to use your own terminology, between the
incorporeal and the incorporeal, even though the one were human, the
other divine, the one changeable and the other unchangeable, than in a
union between the corporeal and the incorporeal.  But perhaps it is the
unprecedented birth of a body from a virgin that staggers you?  But, so
far from this being a difficulty, it ought rather to assist you to
receive our religion, that a miraculous person was born miraculously. 
Or, do you find a difficulty in the fact that, after His body had been
given up to death, and had been changed into a higher kind of body by
resurrection, and was now no longer mortal but incorruptible, He carried
it up into heavenly places?  Perhaps you refuse to believe this, because
you remember that Porphyry, in these very books from which I have cited
so much, and which treat of the return of the soul, so frequently
teaches that a body of every kind is to be escaped from, in order that
the soul may dwell in blessedness with God.  But here, in place of
following Porphyry, you ought rather to have corrected him, especially
since you agree with him in believing such incredible things about the
soul of this visible world and huge material <span id="page_200">p.
200</span> <span id="iv.X.29-Page_200"></span> frame.  For, as scholars
of Plato, you hold that the world is an animal, and a very happy animal,
which you wish to be also everlasting.  How, then, is it never to be
loosed from a body, and yet never lose its happiness, if, in order to
the happiness of the soul, the body must be left behind?  The sun, too,
and the other stars, you not only acknowledge to be bodies, in which you
have the cordial assent of all seeing men, but also, in obedience to
what you reckon a profounder insight, you declare that they are very
blessed animals, and eternal, together with their bodies.  Why is it,
then, that when the Christian faith is pressed upon you, you forget, or
pretend to ignore, what you habitually discuss or teach?  Why is it that
you refuse to be Christians, on the ground that you hold opinions which,
in fact, you yourselves demolish?  Is it not because Christ came in
lowliness, and ye are proud?  The precise nature of the resurrection
bodies of the saints may sometimes occasion discussion among those who
are best read in the Christian Scriptures; yet there is not among us the
smallest doubt that they shall be everlasting, and of a nature
exemplified in the instance of Christ’s risen body.  But whatever be
their nature, since we maintain that they shall be absolutely
incorruptible and immortal, and shall offer no hindrance to the soul’s
contemplation, by which it is fixed in God, and as you say that among
the celestials the bodies of the eternally blessed are eternal, why do
you maintain that, in order to blessedness, every body must be escaped
from?  Why do you thus seek such a plausible reason for escaping from
the Christian faith, if not because, as I again say, Christ is humble
and ye proud?  Are ye ashamed to be corrected?  This is the vice of the
proud.  It is, forsooth, a degradation for learned men to pass from the
school of Plato to the discipleship of Christ, who by His Spirit taught
a fisherman to think and to say, “In the beginning was the Word, and the
Word was with God, and the Word was God.  The same was in the beginning
with God.  All things were made by Him; and without Him was not anything
made that was made.  In Him was life; and the life was the light of
men.  And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended
it not.” <span id="fr_431"></span>[432](#fn_431.md)   The old saint
Simplicianus, afterwards bishop of Milan, used to tell me that a certain
Platonist was in the habit of saying that this opening passage of the
holy gospel, entitled, According to John, should be written in letters
of gold, and hung up in all churches in the most conspicuous place.  But
the proud scorn to take God for their Master, because “the Word was made
flesh and dwelt among us.” <span id="fr_432"></span>[433](#fn_432.md)   So
that, with these miserable creatures, it is not enough that they are
sick, but they boast of their sickness, and are ashamed of the medicine
which could heal them.  And, doing so, they secure not elevation, but a
more disastrous fall.
