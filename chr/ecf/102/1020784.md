<span id="v.vi.iv-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="v.vi.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 4.—How Ambiguities May Be
Solved.</span>

<span id="v.vi.iv-p2"></span>8.  And not only these, but also those
ambiguities that do not relate either to punctuation or pronunciation,
are to be examined in the same way.  For example, that one in the
Epistle to the Thessalonians:  *Propterea consolati sumus fratres in
vobis*. <span id="fr_1851"></span>[1852](#fn_1851)   Now it is doubtful
whether *fratres* \[brethren\] is in the vocative or accusative case,
and it is not contrary to faith to take it either way.  But in the Greek
language the two cases are not the same in form; and accordingly, when
we look into the original, the case is shown to be vocative.  Now if the
translator had chosen to say, *propterea consolationem habuimus fratres
in vobis*, he would have followed the words less literally, but there
would have been less doubt about the meaning; or, indeed, if he had
added *nostri*, hardly any one would have doubted that the vocative case
was meant when he heard *propterea consolati sumus fratres nostri in
vobis*.  But this is a rather dangerous liberty to take.  It has been
taken, however, in that passage to the Corinthians, where the apostle
says, “I protest by your <span id="page_559">p. 559</span> <span
id="v.vi.iv-Page_559"></span> rejoicing \[*per vestram gloriam*\] which
I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.” <span
id="fr_1852"></span>[1853](#fn_1852)   For one translator has it, *per
vestram* juro*gloriam*, the form of adjuration appearing in the Greek
without any ambiguity.  It is therefore very rare and very difficult to
find any ambiguity in the case of proper words, as far at least as Holy
Scripture is concerned, which neither the context, showing the design of
the writer, nor a comparison of translations, nor a reference to the
original tongue, will suffice to explain.
