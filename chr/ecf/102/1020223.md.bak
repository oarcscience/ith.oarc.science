id="iv.VIII.4-p1.1"></span>Chapter 4.—Concerning Plato, the Chief Among
the Disciples of Socrates, and His Threefold Division of
Philosophy.</span>

<span id="iv.VIII.4-p2"></span>But, among the disciples of Socrates,
Plato was the one who shone with a glory which far excelled that of the
others, and who not unjustly eclipsed them all.  By birth, an Athenian
of honorable parentage, he far surpassed his fellow-disciples in natural
endowments, of which he was possessed in a wonderful degree.  Yet,
deeming himself and the Socratic discipline far from sufficient for
bringing philosophy to perfection, he travelled as extensively as he was
able, going to every place famed for the cultivation of any science of
which he could make himself master.  Thus he learned from the Egyptians
whatever they held and taught as important; and from Egypt, passing into
those parts of Italy which were filled with the fame of the
Pythagoreans, he mastered, with the greatest facility, and under the
most eminent teachers, all the Italic philosophy which was then in
vogue.  And, as he had a peculiar love for his master Socrates, he made
him the speaker in all his dialogues, putting into his mouth whatever he
had learned, either from others, or from the efforts of his own powerful
intellect, tempering even his moral disputations with the grace and
politeness of the Socratic style.  And, as the study of wisdom consists
in action and contemplation, so that one part of it may be called
active, and the other contemplative,—the active part having reference to
the conduct of life, that is, to the regulation of morals, and the
contemplative part to the investigation into the causes of nature and
into pure truth,—Socrates is said to have excelled in the active part of
that study, while Pythagoras gave more attention to its contemplative
part, on which he brought to bear all the force of his great intellect. 
To Plato is given the praise of having perfected philosophy by combining
both parts into one. He then divides it into three parts,—the first
moral, which is chiefly occupied with action; the second natural, of
which the object is contemplation; and the third rational, which
discriminates between the true and the false.  And though this last is
necessary both to action and contemplation, it is contemplation,
nevertheless, which lays peculiar claim to the office of investigating
the nature of truth.  Thus <span id="page_147">p. 147</span> <span
id="iv.VIII.4-Page_147"></span> this tripartite division is not contrary
to that which made the study of wisdom to consist in action and
contemplation.  Now, as to what Plato thought with respect to each of
these parts,—that is, what he believed to be the end of all actions, the
cause of all natures, and the light of all intelligences,—it would be a
question too long to discuss, and about which we ought not to make any
rash affirmation.  For, as Plato liked and constantly affected the
well-known method of his master Socrates, namely, that of dissimulating
his knowledge or his opinions, it is not easy to discover clearly what
he himself thought on various matters, any more than it is to discover
what were the real opinions of Socrates.  We must, nevertheless, insert
into our work certain of those opinions which he expresses in his
writings, whether he himself uttered them, or narrates them as expressed
by others, and seems himself to approve of,—opinions sometimes favorable
to the true religion, which our faith takes up and defends, and
sometimes contrary to it, as, for example, in the questions concerning
the existence of one God or of many, as it relates to the truly blessed
life which is to be after death.  For those who are praised as having
most closely followed Plato, who is justly preferred to all the other
philosophers of the Gentiles, and who are said to have manifested the
greatest acuteness in understanding him, do perhaps entertain such an
idea of God as to admit that in Him are to be found the cause of
existence, the ultimate reason for the understanding, and the end in
reference to which the whole life is to be regulated.  Of which three
things, the first is understood to pertain to the natural, the second to
the rational, and the third to the moral part of philosophy.  For if man
has been so created as to attain, through that which is most excellent
in him, to that which excels all things,—that is, to the one true and
absolutely good God, without whom no nature exists, no doctrine
instructs, no exercise profits,—let Him be sought in whom all things are
secure to us, let Him be discovered in whom all truth becomes certain to
us, let Him be loved in whom all becomes right to us.
