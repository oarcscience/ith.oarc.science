<span id="iv.IV.11-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.IV.11-p1.1"></span>Chapter 11.—Concerning the Many Gods Whom the
Pagan Doctors Defend as Being One and the Same Jove.</span>

<span id="iv.IV.11-p2"></span>Let them therefore assert as many things
as ever they please in physical reasonings and disputations.  One while
let Jupiter be the soul of this corporeal world, who fills and moves
that whole mass, constructed and compacted out of four, or as many
elements as they please; another while, let him yield to his sister and
brothers their parts of it:  now let him be the ether, that from above
he may embrace Juno, the air spread out beneath; again, let him be the
whole heaven along with the air, and impregnate with fertilizing showers
and seeds the earth, as his wife, and, at the same time, his mother (for
this is not vile in divine beings); and yet again (that it may not be
necessary to run through them all), let him, the one god, of whom many
think it has been said by a most noble poet,

<span id="iv.IV.11-p3"></span>“For God pervadeth all things,

<span id="iv.IV.11-p4"></span>All lands, and the tracts of the sea, and
the depth of the heavens,” <span id="fr_172"></span>[173](#fn_172.md)

<span id="iv.IV.11-p6"></span>—let it be him who in the ether is
Jupiter; in the air, Juno; in the sea, Neptune; in the lower parts of
the sea, Salacia; in the earth, Pluto; in the lower part of the earth,
Proserpine; on the domestic hearths, Vesta; in the furnace of the
workmen, Vulcan; among the stars, Sol and Luna, and the Stars; in
divination, Apollo; in merchandise, Mercury; in Janus, the initiator; in
Terminus, the terminator; Saturn, in time; Mars and Bellona, in war;
Liber, in vineyards; Ceres, in cornfields; Diana, in forests; Minerva,
in learning.  Finally, let it be him who is in that crowd, as it were,
of plebeian gods:  let him preside under the name of Liber over the seed
of men, and under that of Libera over that of women:  let him be
Diespiter, who brings forth the birth to the light of day:  let him be
the goddess Mena, whom they set over the menstruation of women:  let him
be Lucina, who is invoked by women in childbirth:  let him bring help to
those who are being born, by taking them up from the bosom of the earth,
and let him be called Opis:  let him open the mouth in the crying babe,
and be called the god Vaticanus:  let him lift it from the earth, and be
called the goddess Levana;  let him watch over cradles, and be called
the goddess Cunina:  let it be no other than he who is in those
goddesses, who sing the fates of the new born, and are called
Carmentes:  let him preside over fortuitous events, and be called
Fortuna:  in the goddess Rumina, let him milk out the breast to the
little one, because the ancients termed the breast *ruma*:  in the
goddess Potina, let him administer drink:  in the goddess Educa, let him
supply food:  from the terror of infants, let him be styled Paventia: 
from the hope which comes, Venilia:  from voluptuousness, Volupia:  from
action, Agenor: <span id="page_71">p. 71</span> <span
id="iv.IV.11-Page_71"></span> from the stimulants by which man is
spurred on to much action, let him be named the goddess Stimula:  let
him be the goddess Strenia, for making strenuous;  Numeria, who teaches
to number;  Camoena, who teaches to sing:  let him be both the god
Consus for granting counsel, and the goddess Sentia for inspiring
sentences:  let him be the goddess Juventas, who, after the robe of
boyhood is laid aside, takes charge of the beginning of the youthful
age:  let him be Fortuna Barbata, who endues adults with a beard, whom
they have not chosen to honor; so that this divinity, whatever it may
be, should at least be a male god, named either Barbatus, from *barba*,
like Nodotus, from *nodus*; or, certainly, not Fortuna, but because he
has beards, Fortunius:  let him, in the god Jugatinus, yoke couples in
marriage; and when the girdle of the virgin wife is loosed, let him be
invoked as the goddess Virginiensis:  let him be Mutunus or Tuternus,
who, among the Greeks, is called Priapus.  If they are not ashamed of
it, let all these which I have named, and whatever others I have not
named (for I have not thought fit to name all), let all these gods and
goddesses be that one Jupiter, whether, as some will have it, all these
are parts of him, or are his powers, as those think who are pleased to
consider him the soul of the world, which is the opinion of most of
their doctors, and these the greatest.  If these things are so (how evil
they may be I do not yet meanwhile inquire), what would they lose, if
they, by a more prudent abridgment, should worship one god?  For what
part of him could be contemned if he himself should be worshipped?  But
if they are afraid lest parts of him should be angry at being passed by
or neglected, then it is not the case, as they will have it, that this
whole is as the life of one living being, which contains all the gods
together, as if they were its virtues, or members, or parts; but each
part has its own life separate from the rest, if it is so that one can
be angered, appeased, or stirred up more than another.  But if it is
said that all together,—that is, the whole Jove himself,—would be
offended if his parts were not also worshipped singly and minutely, it
is foolishly spoken.  Surely none of them could be passed by if he who
singly possesses them all should be worshipped.  For, to omit other
things which are innumerable, when they say that all the stars are parts
of Jove, and are all alive, and have rational souls, and therefore
without controversy are gods, can they not see how many they do not
worship, to how many they do not build temples or set up altars, and to
how very few, in fact, of the stars they have thought of setting them up
and offering sacrifice?  If, therefore, those are displeased who are not
severally worshipped, do they not fear to live with only a few appeased,
while all heaven is displeased?  But if they worship all the stars
because they are part of Jove whom they worship, by the same compendious
method they could supplicate them all in him alone.  For in this way no
one would be displeased, since in him alone all would be supplicated. 
No one would be contemned, instead of there being just cause of
displeasure given to the much greater number who are passed by in the
worship offered to some; especially when Priapus, stretched out in vile
nakedness, is preferred to those who shine from their supernal abode.
