<span id="iv.XVII.11-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XVII.11-p1.1"></span>Chapter 11.—Of the Substance of the People
of God, Which Through His Assumption of Flesh is in Christ, Who Alone
Had Power to Deliver His Own Soul from Hell.</span>

<span id="iv.XVII.11-p2"></span>But after having prophesied these
things, the prophet betakes him to praying to God; yet even the very
prayer is prophecy:  “How long, Lord, dost Thou turn away in the
end?” <span id="fr_1058"></span>[1059](#fn_1058)   “Thy face” is
understood, as it is elsewhere said, “How long dost Thou turn away Thy
face from me?” <span id="fr_1059"></span>[1060](#fn_1059)   For
therefore some copies have here not “dost,” but “wilt Thou turn away;”
although it could be understood, “Thou turnest away Thy mercy, which
Thou didst promise to David.”  But when he says, “in the end,” what does
it mean, except even to the end?  By which end is to be understood the
last time, when even that nation is to believe in Christ Jesus, before
which end what He has just sorrowfully bewailed must come to pass.  On
account of which it is also added here, “Thy wrath shall burn like
fire.  Remember what is my substance.” <span
id="fr_1060"></span>[1061](#fn_1060)   This cannot be better understood
than of Jesus Himself, the substance of His people, of whose nature His
flesh is.  “For not in vain,” he says, “hast Thou made all the sons of
men.” <span id="fr_1061"></span>[1062](#fn_1061)   For unless the one
Son of man had been the substance of Israel, through which Son of man
many sons of men should be set free, all the sons of men would have been
made wholly in vain.  But now, indeed, all mankind through the fall of
the first man has fallen from the truth into vanity; for which reason
another psalm says, “Man is like to vanity:  his days pass away as a
shadow;” <span id="fr_1062"></span>[1063](#fn_1062) yet God has not made
all the sons of men in vain, because He frees many from vanity through
the Mediator Jesus, and those whom He did not foreknow as to be
delivered, He made not wholly in vain in the most beautiful and most
just ordination of the whole rational creation, for the use of those who
were to be <span id="page_351">p. 351</span> <span
id="iv.XVII.11-Page_351"></span> delivered, and for the comparison of
the two cities by mutual contrast.  Thereafter it follows, “Who is the
man that shall live, and shall not see death? shall he snatch his soul
from the hand of hell?” <span id="fr_1063"></span>[1064](#fn_1063)   Who
is this but that substance of Israel out of the seed of David, Christ
Jesus, of whom the apostle says, that “rising from the dead He now dieth
not, and death shall no more have dominion over Him?” <span
id="fr_1064"></span>[1065](#fn_1064)   For He shall so live and not see
death, that yet He shall have been dead; but shall have delivered His
soul from the hand of hell, whither He had descended in order to loose
some from the chains of hell; but He hath delivered it by that power of
which He says in the Gospel, “I have the power of laying down my life,
and I have the power of taking it again.” <span
id="fr_1065"></span>[1066](#fn_1065)
