<span id="iv.X.27-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.X.27-p1.1"></span>Chapter 27.—Of the Impiety of Porphyry, Which
is Worse Than Even the Mistake of Apuleius.</span>

<span id="iv.X.27-p2"></span>How much more tolerable and accordant with
human feeling is the error of your Platonist co-sectary Apuleius! for he
attributed the diseases and storms of human passions only to the demons
who occupy a grade beneath the moon, and makes even this avowal as by
constraint regarding gods whom he honors; but the superior and celestial
gods, who inhabit the ethereal regions, whether visible, as the sun,
moon, and other luminaries, whose brilliancy makes them conspicuous, or
invisible, but believed in by him, he does his utmost to remove beyond
the slightest stain of these perturbations.  It is not, then, from
Plato, but from your Chaldæan teachers you have learned to elevate human
vices to the ethereal and empyreal regions of the world and to the
celestial firmament, in order that your theurgists might be able to
obtain from your gods divine revelations; and yet you make yourself
superior to these divine revelations by your intellectual life, which
dispenses with these theurgic purifications as not needed by a
philosopher.  But, by way of rewarding your teachers, you recommend
these arts to other men, who, not being philosophers, may be persuaded
to use what you acknowledge to be useless to yourself, who are capable
of higher things; so that those who cannot avail themselves of the
virtue of philosophy, which is too arduous for the multitude, may, at
your instigation, betake themselves to theurgists by whom they may be
purified, not, indeed, in the intellectual, but in the spiritual part of
the soul.  Now, as the persons who are unfit for philosophy form
incomparably the majority of mankind, more may be compelled to consult
these secret and illicit teachers of yours than frequent the Platonic
schools.  For these most impure demons, pretending to be ethereal gods,
whose herald and messenger you have become, have promised that those who
are purified by theurgy in the spiritual part of their soul shall not
indeed return to the Father, but shall dwell among the ethereal gods
above the aerial regions.  But such fancies are not listened to by the
multitudes of men whom Christ came to set free from the tyranny of
demons.  For in Him they have the most gracious cleansing, in which
mind, spirit, and body alike participate.  For, in order that He might
heal the whole man from the plague of sin, He took without sin the whole
human nature.  Would that you had known Him, and would that you had
committed yourself for healing to Him rather than to your own frail and
infirm human virtue, or to pernicious and curious arts!  He would not
have deceived you; for Him your own oracles, on your own showing,
acknowledged holy and immortal.  It is of Him, too, that the most famous
poet speaks, poetically indeed, since he applies it to the person of
another, yet truly, if you refer it to Christ <span id="page_198">p.
198</span> <span id="iv.X.27-Page_198"></span> , saying, “Under thine
auspices, if any traces of our crimes remain, they shall be obliterated,
and earth freed from its perpetual fear.” <span
id="fr_427"></span>[428](#fn_427.md)   By which he indicates that, by
reason of the infirmity which attaches to this life, the greatest
progress in virtue and righteousness leaves room for the existence, if
not of crimes, yet of the traces of crimes, which are obliterated only
by that Saviour of whom this verse speaks.  For that he did not say this
at the prompting of his own fancy, Virgil tells us in almost the last
verse of that 4th Eclogue, when he says, “The last age predicted by the
Cumæan sibyl has now arrived;” whence it plainly appears that this had
been dictated by the Cumæan sibyl.  But those theurgists, or rather
demons, who assume the appearance and form of gods, pollute rather than
purify the human spirit by false appearances and the delusive mockery of
unsubstantial forms.  How can those whose own spirit is unclean cleanse
the spirit of man?  Were they not unclean, they would not be bound by
the incantations of an envious man, and would neither be afraid nor
grudge to bestow that hollow boon which they promise.  But it is
sufficient for our purpose that you acknowledge that the intellectual
soul, that is, our mind, cannot be justified by theurgy; and that even
the spiritual or inferior part of our soul cannot by this act be made
eternal and immortal, though you maintain that it can be purified by
it.  Christ, however, promises life eternal; and therefore to Him the
world flocks, greatly to your indignation, greatly also to your
astonishment and confusion.  What avails your forced avowal that theurgy
leads men astray, and deceives vast numbers by its ignorant and foolish
teaching, and that it is the most manifest mistake to have recourse by
prayer and sacrifice to angels and principalities, when at the same
time, to save yourself from the charge of spending labor in vain on such
arts, you direct men to the theurgists, that by their means men, who do
not live by the rule of the intellectual soul, may have their spiritual
soul purified?
