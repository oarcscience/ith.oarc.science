<span id="iv.III.16-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.III.16-p1.1"></span>Chapter 16.—Of the First Roman Consuls, the
One of Whom Drove the Other from the Country, and Shortly After Perished
at Rome by the Hand of a Wounded Enemy, and So Ended a Career of
Unnatural Murders.</span>

<span id="iv.III.16-p2"></span>To this epoch let us add also that of
which Sallust says, that it was ordered with justice and moderation,
while the fear of Tarquin and of a war with Etruria was impending.  For
so long as the Etrurians aided the efforts of Tarquin to regain the
throne, Rome was convulsed with distressing war.  And therefore he says
that the state was ordered with justice and moderation, through the
pressure of fear, not through the influence of equity.  And in this very
brief period, how calamitous a year was that in which consuls were first
created, when the kingly power was abolished!  They did not fulfill
their term of office.  For Junius Brutus deprived his colleague Lucius
Tarquinius Collatinus, and banished him from the city; and shortly after
he himself fell in battle, at once slaying and slain, having formerly
put to death his own sons and his brothers-in-law, because he had
discovered that they were conspiring to restore Tarquin.  It is this
deed that Virgil shudders to record, even while he seems to praise it;
for when he says:

<span id="iv.III.16-p3"></span>“And call his own rebellious seed

<span id="iv.III.16-p4"></span>For menaced liberty to bleed,”

<span id="iv.III.16-p5"></span>he immediately exclaims,

<span id="iv.III.16-p6"></span>“Unhappy father! howsoe’er

<span id="iv.III.16-p7"></span>The deed be judged by after days;”

<span id="iv.III.16-p8"></span>that is to say, let posterity judge the
deed as they please, let them praise and extol the father who slew his
sons, he is unhappy.  And then he adds, as if to console so unhappy a
man:

<span id="iv.III.16-p9"></span>“His country’s love shall all o’erbear,

<span id="iv.III.16-p10"></span>And unextinguished thirst of
praise.” <span id="fr_148"></span>[149](#fn_148.md)

<span id="iv.III.16-p12"></span>In the tragic end of Brutus, who slew
his own sons, and though he slew his enemy, Tarquin’s son, yet could not
survive him, but was survived by Tarquin the elder, does not the
innocence of his colleague Collatinus seem to be vindicated, who, though
a good citizen, suffered the same punishment as Tarquin himself, when
that tyrant was banished?  For Brutus himself is said to have been a
relative <span id="fr_149"></span>[150](#fn_149.md) of Tarquin.  But
Collatinus had the misfortune to bear not only the blood, but the name
of Tarquin.  To change his name, then, not his country, would have been
his fit penalty:  to abridge his name by this word, and be called simply
L. Collatinus.  But he was not com <span id="page_53">p. 53</span> <span
id="iv.III.16-Page_53"></span> pelled to lose what he could lose without
detriment, but was stripped of the honor of the first consulship, and
was banished from the land he loved.  Is this, then, the glory of
Brutus—this injustice, alike detestable and profitless to the republic? 
Was it to this he was driven by “his country’s love, and unextinguished
thirst of praise?”

<span id="iv.III.16-p14"></span>When Tarquin the tyrant was expelled, L.
Tarquinius Collatinus, the husband of Lucretia, was created consul along
with Brutus.  How justly the people acted, in looking more to the
character than the name of a citizen!  How unjustly Brutus acted, in
depriving of honor and country his colleague in that new office, whom he
might have deprived of his name, if it were so offensive to him!  Such
were the ills, such the disasters, which fell out when the government
was “ordered with justice and moderation.”  Lucretius, too, who
succeeded Brutus, was carried off by disease before the end of that same
year.  So P. Valerius, who succeeded Collatinus, and M. Horatius, who
filled the vacancy occasioned by the death of Lucretius, completed that
disastrous and funereal year, which had five consuls.  Such was the year
in which the Roman republic inaugurated the new honor and office of the
consulship.
