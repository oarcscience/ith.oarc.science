<p class="c21"><a name="iv.XIV.18-p2"></A>Lust requires for its consummation darkness and secrecy; and this not only when un  <A NAME="page_277"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 277</FONT></A> <a name="iv.XIV.18-Page_277"></A>  lawful intercourse is desired, but even such fornication as the earthly city has legalized.&#160; Where there is no fear of punishment, these permitted pleasures still shrink from the public eye.&#160; Even where provision is made for this lust, secrecy also is provided; and while lust found it easy to remove the prohibitions of law, shamelessness found it impossible to lay aside the veil of retirement.&#160; For even shameless men call this shameful; and though they love the pleasure, dare not display it.&#160; What! does not even conjugal intercourse, sanctioned as it is by law for the propagation of children, legitimate and honorable though it be, does it not seek retirement from every eye?&#160; Before the bridegroom fondles his bride, does he not exclude the attendants, and even the paranymphs, and such friends as the closest ties have admitted to the bridal chamber?&#160; The greatest master of Roman eloquence says, that all right actions wish to be set in the light, <i>i.e</i>., desire to be known.&#160; This right action, however, has such a desire to be known, that yet it blushes to be seen.&#160; Who does not know what passes between husband and wife that children may be born?&#160; Is it not for this purpose that wives are married with such ceremony?&#160; And yet, when this well-understood act is gone about for the procreation of children, not even the children themselves, who may already have been born to them, are suffered to be witnesses.&#160; This right action seeks the light, in so far as it seeks to be known, but yet dreads being seen.&#160; And why so, if not because that which is by nature fitting and decent is so done as to be accompanied with a shame-begetting penalty of sin?</p>
