<span id="iv.XVIII.48-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XVIII.48-p1.1"></span>Chapter 48.—That Haggai’s Prophecy, in
Which He Said that the Glory of the House of God Would Be Greater Than
that of the First Had Been, <span id="fr_1229"></span>[1230](#fn_1229)
Was Really Fulfilled, Not in the Rebuilding of the Temple, But in the
Church of Christ.</span>

<span id="iv.XVIII.48-p3"></span>This house of God is more glorious than
that first one which was constructed of wood and stone, metals and other
precious things.  Therefore the prophecy of Haggai was not fulfilled in
the rebuilding of that temple.  For it can never be shown to have had so
much glory after it was rebuilt as it had in the time of Solomon; yea,
rather, the glory of that house is shown to have been diminished, first
by the ceasing of prophecy, and then by the nation itself suffering so
great calamities, even to the final destruction made by the Romans, as
the things above-mentioned prove.  But this house which pertains to the
new testament is just as much more glorious as the living stones, even
believing, renewed men, of which it is constructed are better.  But it
was typified by the rebuilding of that temple for this reason, because
the very renovation of that edifice typifies in the prophetic oracle
another testament which is called the new.  When, therefore, God said by
the prophet just named, “And I will give peace in this place,” <span
id="fr_1230"></span>[1231](#fn_1230) He is to be understood who is
typified by that typical place; for since by that rebuilt place is
typified the Church which was to be built by Christ, nothing else can be
accepted as the meaning of the saying, “I will give peace in this
place,” except I will give peace in the place which that place
signifies.  For all typical things seem in some way to personate those
whom they typify, as it is said by the apostle, “That Rock was
Christ.” <span id="fr_1231"></span>[1232](#fn_1231)   Therefore the
glory of this new testament house is greater than the glory of the old
testament house; and it will show itself as greater when it shall be
dedicated.  For then “shall come the desired of all nations,” <span
id="fr_1232"></span>[1233](#fn_1232) as we read in the Hebrew.  For
before His advent He had not yet been desired by all nations.  For they
knew not Him whom they ought to desire, in whom they had not believed. 
Then, also, according to the Septuagint interpretation (for it also is a
prophetic meaning), “shall come those who are elected of the Lord out of
all nations.”  For then indeed there shall come only those who are
elected, whereof the apostle saith, “According as He hath chosen us in
Him before the foundation of the world.” <span
id="fr_1233"></span>[1234](#fn_1233)   For the Master Builder who said,
“Many are <span id="page_391">p. 391</span> <span
id="iv.XVIII.48-Page_391"></span> called, but few are chosen,” <span
id="fr_1234"></span>[1235](#fn_1234) did not say this of those who, on
being called, came in such a way as to be cast out from the feast, but
would point out the house built up of the elect, which henceforth shall
dread no ruin.  Yet because the churches are also full of those who
shall be separated by the winnowing as in the threshing-floor, the glory
of this house is not so apparent now as it shall be when every one who
is there shall be there always.
