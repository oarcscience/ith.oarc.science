id="iv.XIX.9-p1.1"></span>Chapter 9.—Of the Friendship of the Holy
Angels, Which Men Cannot Be Sure of in This Life, Owing to the Deceit of
the Demons Who Hold in Bondage the Worshippers of a Plurality of
Gods.</span>

<span id="iv.XIX.9-p2"></span>The philosophers who wished us to have the
gods for our friends rank the friendship of the holy angels in the
fourth circle of society, advancing now from the three circles of
society on earth to the universe, and embracing heaven itself.  And in
this friendship we have indeed no fear that the angels will grieve us by
their death or deterioration.  But as we cannot mingle with them as
familiarly as with men (which itself is one of the grievances of this
life), and as Satan, as we read, <span
id="fr_1276"></span>[1277](#fn_1276) sometimes transforms himself into
an angel of light, to tempt those whom it is necessary to discipline, or
just to deceive, there is great need of God’s mercy to preserve us from
making friends of demons in disguise, while we fancy we have good angels
for our friends; for the astuteness and deceitfulness of these wicked
spirits is equalled by their hurtfulness.  And is this not a great
misery of human life, that we are involved in such ignorance as, but for
God’s mercy, makes us a prey to these demons?  And it is very certain
that the philosophers of the godless city, who have maintained that the
gods were their friends, had fallen a prey to the malignant demons who
rule that city, and whose eternal punishment is to be shared by it.  For
the nature of these beings is sufficiently evinced by the sacred or
rather sacrilegious observances which form their worship, and by the
filthy games in which their crimes are celebrated, and which they
themselves originated and exacted from their worshippers as a fit
propitiation.
