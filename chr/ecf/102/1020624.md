<span id="iv.XX.22-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XX.22-p1.1"></span>Chapter 22.—What is Meant by the Good Going
Out to See the Punishment of the Wicked.</span>

<span id="iv.XX.22-p2"></span>But in what way shall the good go out to
see the punishment of the wicked?  Are they to leave their happy abodes
by a bodily movement, and proceed to the places of punishment, so as to
witness the torments of the wicked in their bodily presence?  Certainly
not; but they shall go out by knowledge.  For this expression, *go out*,
signifies that those who shall be punished shall be without.  And thus
the Lord also calls these places “the outer darkness,” <span
id="fr_1430"></span>[1431](#fn_1430.md) to which is opposed that entrance
concerning which it is said to the good servant, “Enter into the joy of
thy Lord,” that it may not be supposed that the wicked can enter thither
and be known, but rather that the good by their knowledge go out to
them, because the good are to know that which is without.  For those who
shall be in torment shall not know what is going on within in the joy of
the Lord; but they who shall enter into that joy shall know what is
going on outside in the outer darkness.  Therefore it is said, “They
shall go out,” because they shall know what is done by those who are
without.  For if the prophets were able to know things that had not yet
happened, by means of that indwelling of God in their minds, limited
though it was, shall not the immortal saints know things that have
already happened, when God shall be all in all? <span
id="fr_1431"></span>[1432](#fn_1431.md)   The seed, then, and the name of
the saints shall remain in that blessedness,—the seed, to wit, of which
John says, “And his seed remaineth in him;” <span
id="fr_1432"></span>[1433](#fn_1432.md) and the name, of which it was said
through Isaiah himself, “I will give them an everlasting name.” <span
id="fr_1433"></span>[1434](#fn_1433.md)   “And there shall be to them month
after month, and Sabbath after Sabbath,” as if it were said, Moon after
moon, and rest upon rest, both of which they shall themselves be when
they shall pass from the old shadows of time into the new lights of
eternity.  The worm that dieth not, and the fire that is not quenched,
which constitute the punishment of the wicked, are differently
interpreted by different people.  For some refer both to the body,
others refer both to the soul; while others again refer the fire
literally to the body, and the worm figuratively to the soul, which
seems the more credible idea.  But the present is not the time to
discuss this difference, for we have undertaken to occupy this book with
the last judgment, in which the good and the bad are separated:  their
rewards and punishments we shall more carefully discuss elsewhere.
