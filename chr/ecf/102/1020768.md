<span id="v.v.xxxi-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="v.v.xxxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 31.—Use of Dialectics.  Of
Fallacies.</span>

<span id="v.v.xxxi-p2"></span>48.  There remain those branches of
knowledge which pertain not to the bodily senses, but to the intellect,
among which the science of reasoning and that of number are the chief. 
The science of reasoning is of very great service in searching into and
unravelling all sorts of questions that come up in Scripture, only in
the use of it we must guard against the love of wrangling, and the
childish vanity of entrapping an adversary.  For there are many of what
are called *sophisms*, inferences in reasoning that are false, and yet
so close an imitation of the true, as to deceive not only dull people,
but clever men too, when they are not on their guard.  For example, one
man lays before another with whom he is talking, the proposition, “What
I am, you are not.”  The other assents, for the proposition is in part
true, the one man being cunning and the other simple.  Then the first
speaker adds:  “I am a man;” and when the other has given his assent to
this also, the first draws his conclusion:  “Then you are not a man.” 
Now of this sort of ensnaring arguments, Scripture, as I judge,
expresses detestation in that place where it is said, “There is one that
showeth wisdom in words, and is hated;” <span
id="fr_1818"></span>[1819](#fn_1818.md) although, indeed, a style of speech
which is not intended to entrap, but <span id="page_551">p. 551</span>
<span id="v.v.xxxi-Page_551"></span> only aims at verbal ornamentation
more than is consistent with seriousness of purpose, is also called
sophistical.

<span id="v.v.xxxi-p4"></span>49.  There are also valid processes of
reasoning which lead to false conclusions, by following out to its
logical consequences the error of the man with whom one is arguing; and
these conclusions are sometimes drawn by a good and learned man, with
the object of making the person from whose error these consequences
result, feel ashamed of them and of thus leading him to give up his
error when he finds that if he wishes to retain his old opinion, he must
of necessity also hold other opinions which he condemns.  For example,
the apostle did not draw true conclusions when he said, “Then is Christ
not risen,” and again, “Then is our preaching vain, and your faith is
also vain;” <span id="fr_1819"></span>[1820](#fn_1819.md) and further on
drew other inferences which are all utterly false; for Christ has risen,
the preaching of those who declared this fact was not in vain, nor was
their faith in vain who had believed it.  But all these false inferences
followed legitimately from the opinion of those who said that there is
no resurrection of the dead.  These inferences, then, being repudiated
as false, it follows that since they would be true if the dead rise not,
there will be a resurrection of the dead.  As, then, valid conclusions
may be drawn not only from true but from false propositions, the laws of
valid reasoning may easily be learnt in the schools, outside the pale of
the Church.  But the truth of propositions must be inquired into in the
sacred books of the Church.
