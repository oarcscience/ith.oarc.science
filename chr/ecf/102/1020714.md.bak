id="v.iv.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 18.—The Keys Given to the
Church.</span>

<span id="v.iv.xviii-p2"></span>17.  He has given, therefore, the keys
to His Church, that whatsoever it should bind on earth might be bound in
heaven, and whatsoever it should loose on earth might be loosed in
heaven; <span id="fr_1729"></span>[1730](#fn_1729.md) that is to say, that
whosoever in the Church should not believe that his sins are remitted,
they should not be remitted to him; but that whosoever should believe
and should repent, and turn from his sins, should be saved by the same
faith and repentance on the ground of which he is received into the
bosom of the Church.  For he who does not believe that his sins can be
pardoned, falls into despair, and becomes worse as if no greater good
remained for him than to be evil, when he has ceased to have faith in
the results of his own repentance.
