<span id="iv.IX.4-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.IX.4-p1.1"></span>Chapter 4.—The Opinion of the Peripatetics and
Stoics About Mental Emotions.</span>

<span id="iv.IX.4-p2"></span>Among the philosophers there are two
opinions about these mental emotions, which the Greeks call <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.IX.4-p2.1"></span>παθη</span>, while some of
our own writers, as Cicero, call them perturbations, <span
id="fr_335"></span>[336](#fn_335.md) some affections, and some, to render
the Greek word more accurately, passions.  Some say that even the wise
man is subject to these perturbations, though moderated and controlled
by reason, which imposes laws upon them, and so restrains them within
necessary bounds.  This is the opinion of the Platonists and
Aristotelians; for Aristotle was Plato’s disciple, and the founder of
the Peripatetic school.  But others, as the Stoics, are of opinion that
the wise man is not subject to these perturbations.  But Cicero, in his
book *De Finibus*, shows that the Stoics are here at variance with the
Platonists and Peripatetics rather in words than in reality; for the
Stoics decline to apply the term “goods” to external and bodily
advantages, <span id="fr_336"></span>[337](#fn_336.md) because they reckon
that the only good is virtue, the art of living well, and this exists
only in the mind.  The other philosophers, again, use the simple and
customary phraseology, and do not scruple to call these things goods,
though in comparison of virtue, which guides our life, they are little
and of small esteem.  And thus it is obvious that, whether these outward
things are called goods or advantages, they are held in the same
estimation by both parties, and that in this matter the Stoics are
pleasing themselves merely with a novel phraseology.  It seems, then, to
me that in this question, whether the wise man is subject to mental
passions, or wholly free from them, the controversy is one of words
rather than of things; for I think that, if the reality and not the mere
sound of the words is considered, the Stoics hold precisely the same
opinion as the Platonists and Peripatetics.  For, omitting for brevity’s
sake other proofs which I might adduce in support of this opinion, I
will state but one which I consider conclusive.  Aulus Gellius, a man of
extensive erudition, and gifted with an eloquent and graceful <span
id="page_168">p. 168</span> <span id="iv.IX.4-Page_168"></span> style,
relates, in his work entitled *Noctes* *Atticæ* <span
id="fr_337"></span>[338](#fn_337.md) that he once made a voyage with an
eminent Stoic philosopher; and he goes on to relate fully and with gusto
what I shall barely state, that when the ship was tossed and in danger
from a violent storm, the philosopher grew pale with terror.  This was
noticed by those on board, who, though themselves threatened with death,
were curious to see whether a philosopher would be agitated like other
men.  When the tempest had passed over, and as soon as their security
gave them freedom to resume their talk, one of the passengers, a rich
and luxurious Asiatic, begins to banter the philosopher, and rally him
because he had even become pale with fear, while he himself had been
unmoved by the impending destruction.  But the philosopher availed
himself of the reply of Aristippus the Socratic, who, on finding himself
similarly bantered by a man of the same character, answered, “You had no
cause for anxiety for the soul of a profligate debauchee, but I had
reason to be alarmed for the soul of Aristippus.”  The rich man being
thus disposed of, Aulus Gellius asked the philosopher, in the interests
of science and not to annoy him, what was the reason of his fear?  And
he willing to instruct a man so zealous in the pursuit of knowledge, at
once took from his wallet a book of Epictetus the Stoic, <span
id="fr_338"></span>[339](#fn_338.md) in which doctrines were advanced which
precisely harmonized with those of Zeno and Chrysippus, the founders of
the Stoical school.  Aulus Gellius says that he read in this book that
the Stoics maintain that there are certain impressions made on the soul
by external objects which they call *phantasiæ*, and that it is not in
the power of the soul to determine whether or when it shall be invaded
by these.  When these impressions are made by alarming and formidable
objects, it must needs be that they move the soul even of the wise man,
so that for a little he trembles with fear, or is depressed by sadness,
these impressions anticipating the work of reason and self-control; but
this does not imply that the mind accepts these evil impressions, or
approves or consents to them.  For this consent is, they think, in a
man’s power; there being this difference between the mind of the wise
man and that of the fool, that the fool’s mind yields to these passions
and consents to them, while that of the wise man, though it cannot help
being invaded by them, yet retains with unshaken firmness a true and
steady persuasion of those things which it ought rationally to desire or
avoid.  This account of what Aulus Gellius relates that he read in the
book of Epictetus about the sentiments and doctrines of the Stoics I
have given as well as I could, not, perhaps, with his choice language,
but with greater brevity, and, I think, with greater clearness.  And if
this be true, then there is no difference, or next to none, between the
opinion of the Stoics and that of the other philosophers regarding
mental passions and perturbations, for both parties agree in maintaining
that the mind and reason of the wise man are not subject to these.  And
perhaps what the Stoics mean by asserting this, is that the wisdom which
characterizes the wise man is clouded by no error and sullied by no
taint, but, with this reservation that his wisdom remains undisturbed,
he is exposed to the impressions which the goods and ills of this life
(or, as they prefer to call them, the advantages or disadvantages) make
upon them.  For we need not say that if that philosopher had thought
nothing of those things which he thought he was forthwith to lose, life
and bodily safety, he would not have been so terrified by his danger as
to betray his fear by the pallor of his cheek.  Nevertheless, he might
suffer this mental disturbance, and yet maintain the fixed persuasion
that life and bodily safety, which the violence of the tempest
threatened to destroy, are not those good things which make their
possessors good, as the possession of righteousness does.  But in so far
as they persist that we must call them not goods but advantages, they
quarrel about words and neglect things.  For what difference does it
make whether goods or advantages be the better name, while the Stoic no
less than the Peripatetic is alarmed at the prospect of losing them, and
while, though they name them differently, they hold them in like
esteem?  Both parties assure us that, if urged to the commission of some
immorality or crime by the threatened loss of these goods or advantages,
they would prefer to lose such things as preserve bodily comfort and
security rather than commit such things as violate righteousness.  And
thus the mind in which this resolution is well grounded suffers no
perturbations to prevail with it in opposition to reason, even though
they assail the weaker parts of the soul; and not only so, but it rules
over them, and, while it refuses its consent and resists them,
administers a reign of virtue.  Such a character is ascribed to Æneas by
Virgil when he says,

<span id="iv.IX.4-p7"></span>“He stands immovable by tears,

<span id="iv.IX.4-p8"></span>Nor tenderest words with pity hears.” <span
