<span id="iv.III.7-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.III.7-p1.1"></span>Chapter 7.—Of the Destruction of Ilium by
Fimbria, a Lieutenant of Marius.</span>

<span id="iv.III.7-p2"></span>And surely we may ask what wrong poor
Ilium had done, that, in the first heat of the civil wars of Rome, it
should suffer at the hand of Fimbria, the veriest villain among Marius’
partisans, a more fierce and cruel destruction than the Grecian
sack. <span id="fr_129"></span>[130](#fn_129.md)   For when the Greeks took
it many escaped, and many who did not escape were suffered to live,
though in captivity.  But Fimbria from the first gave orders that not a
life should be spared, and burnt up together the city and all its
inhabitants.  Thus was Ilium requited, not by the Greeks, whom she had
provoked by wrong-doing; but by the Romans, who had been built out of
her ruins; while the gods, adored alike of both sides, did simply
nothing, or, to speak more correctly, could do nothing.  Is it then
true, that at this time also, after Troy had repaired the damage done by
the Grecian fire, all the gods by whose help the kingdom stood, “forsook
each fane, each sacred shrine?”

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span> <span id="iv.III.7-Page_46"></span>

<span id="iv.III.7-p4"></span>But if so, I ask the reason; for in my
judgment, the conduct of the gods was as much to be reprobated as that
of the townsmen to be applauded.  For these closed their gates against
Fimbria, that they might preserve the city for Sylla, and were therefore
burnt and consumed by the enraged general.  Now, up to this time,
Sylla’s cause was the more worthy of the two; for till now he used arms
to restore the republic, and as yet his good intentions had met with no
reverses.  What better thing, then, could the Trojans have done?  What
more honorable, what more faithful to Rome, or more worthy of her
relationship, than to preserve their city for the better part of the
Romans, and to shut their gates against a parricide of his country?  It
is for the defenders of the gods to consider the ruin which this conduct
brought on Troy.  The gods deserted an adulterous people, and abandoned
Troy to the fires of the Greeks, that out of her ashes a chaster Rome
might arise.  But why did they a second time abandon this same town,
allied now to Rome, and not making war upon her noble daughter, but
preserving a most steadfast and pious fidelity to Rome’s most
justifiable faction?  Why did they give her up to be destroyed, not by
the Greek heroes, but by the basest of the Romans?  Or, if the gods did
not favor Sylla’s cause, for which the unhappy Trojans maintained their
city, why did they themselves predict and promise Sylla such successes? 
Must we call them flatterers of the fortunate, rather than helpers of
the wretched?  Troy was not destroyed, then, because the gods deserted
it.  For the demons, always watchful to deceive, did what they could. 
For, when all the statues were overthrown and burnt together with the
town, Livy tells us that only the image of Minerva is said to have been
found standing uninjured amidst the ruins of her temple; not that it
might be said in their praise, “The gods who made this realm divine,”
but that it might not be said in their defence, They are “gone from each
fane, each sacred shrine:”  for that marvel was permitted to them, not
that they might be proved to be powerful, but that they might be
convicted of being present.
