<p class="c21"><a name="iv.VI.11-p2"></A>Seneca, among the other superstitions of civil theology, also found fault with the sacred things of the Jews, and especially the sabbaths, affirming that they act uselessly in keeping those seventh days, whereby they lose through idleness about the seventh part of their life, and also many things which demand immediate attention are damaged.&#160; The Christians, however, who were already most hostile to the Jews, he did not dare to mention, either for praise or blame, lest, if he praised them, he should do so against the ancient custom of his country, or, perhaps, if he should blame them, he should do so against his own will.</p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="iv.VI.11-p3"></A>When he was speaking concerning those Jews, he said, &#8220;When, meanwhile, the customs of that most accursed nation have gained such strength that they have been now received in all lands, the conquered have given  <A NAME="page_121"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 121</FONT></A> <a name="iv.VI.11-Page_121"></A>  laws to the conquerors.&#8221;&#160; By these words he expresses his astonishment; and, not knowing what the providence of God was leading him to say, subjoins in plain words an opinion by which he showed what he thought about the meaning of those sacred institutions:&#160; &#8220;For,&#8221; he says, &#8220;those, however, know the cause of their rites, whilst the greater part of the people know not why they perform theirs.&#8221;&#160; But concerning the solemnities of the Jews, either why or how far they were instituted by divine authority, and afterwards, in due time, by the same authority taken away from the people of God, to whom the mystery of eternal life was revealed, we have both spoken elsewhere, especially when we were treating against the Manich&aelig;ans, and also intend to speak in this work in a more suitable place.</p>
