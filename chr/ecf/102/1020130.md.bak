id="iv.IV.25-p1.1"></span>Chapter 25.—Concerning the One God Only to Be
Worshipped, Who, Although His Name is Unknown, is Yet Deemed to Be the
Giver of Felicity.</span>

<span id="iv.IV.25-p2"></span>Having had that reason rendered to us, we
shall perhaps much more easily persuade, as we wish, those whose heart
has not become too much hardened.  For if now human infirmity has
perceived that felicity cannot be given except by some god; if this was
perceived by those who worshipped so many gods, at whose head they set
Jupiter himself; if, in their ignorance of the name of Him by whom
felicity was given, they agreed to call Him by the name of that very
thing which they believed He gave;—then it follows that they thought
that felicity could not be given even by Jupiter himself, whom they
already worshipped, but certainly by him whom they thought fit to
worship under the name of Felicity itself.  I thoroughly affirm the
statement that they believed felicity to be given by a certain God whom
they knew not:  let Him therefore be sought after, let Him be
worshipped, and it is enough.  Let the train of innumerable demons be
repudiated, and let this God suffice every man whom his gift suffices. 
For him, I say, God the giver of felicity will not be enough to worship,
for whom felicity itself is not enough to receive.  But let him for whom
it suffices (and man has nothing more he ought to wish for) serve the
one God, the giver of felicity.  This God is not he whom they call
Jupiter.  For if they acknowledged him to be the giver of felicity, they
would not seek, under the name of Felicity itself, for another god or
goddess by whom felicity might be given; nor could they tolerate that
Jupiter himself should be worshipped with such infamous attributes.  For
he is said to be the debaucher of the wives of others; he is the
shameless lover and ravisher of a beautiful boy.
