<span id="v.iv.iv-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="v.iv.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 4.—Difference of Use and
Enjoyment.</span>

<span id="v.iv.iv-p2"></span>4.  For to enjoy a thing is to rest with
satisfaction in it for its own sake.  To use, on the other hand, is to
employ whatever means are at one’s disposal to obtain what one desires,
if it is a proper object of desire; for an unlawful use ought rather to
be called an abuse.  Suppose, then, we were wanderers in a strange
country, and could not live happily away from our fatherland, and that
we felt wretched in our wandering, and wishing to put an end to our
misery, determined to return home.  We find, however, that we must make
use of some mode of conveyance, either by land or water, in order to
reach that fatherland where our enjoyment is to commence.  But the
beauty of the country through which we pass, and the very pleasure of
the motion, charm our hearts, and turning these things which we ought to
use into objects of enjoyment, we become unwilling to hasten the end of
our journey; and becoming engrossed in a factitious delight, our
thoughts are diverted from that home whose delights would make us truly
happy.  Such is a picture of our condition in this life of mortality. 
We have wandered far from God; and if we wish to return to our Father’s
home, this world must be used, not enjoyed, that so the invisible things
of God may be clearly seen, being understood by the things that are
made, <span id="fr_1721"></span>[1722](#fn_1721) —that is, that by means
of what is material and temporary we may lay hold upon that which is
spiritual and eternal.
