id="iv.IV.4-p1.1"></span>Chapter 4.—How Like Kingdoms Without Justice
are to Robberies.</span>

<span id="iv.IV.4-p2"></span>Justice being taken away, then, what are
kingdoms but great robberies?  For what are robberies themselves, but
little kingdoms?  The band itself is made up of men; it is ruled by the
authority of a prince, it is knit together by the pact of the
confederacy; the booty is divided by the law agreed on.  If, by the
admittance of abandoned men, this evil increases to such a degree that
it holds places, fixes abodes, takes possession of cities, and subdues
peoples, it assumes the more plainly the name of a kingdom, because the
reality is now manifestly conferred on it, not by the removal of
covetousness, but by the addition of impunity.  Indeed, that was an apt
and true reply which was given to Alexander the Great by a pirate who
had been seized.  For when that king had asked the man what he meant by
keeping hostile possession of the sea, he answered with bold pride,
“What thou meanest by seizing the whole earth; but because I do it with
a petty ship, I am called a robber, whilst thou who dost it with a great
fleet art styled emperor.” <span id="fr_163"></span>[164](#fn_163)
