<span id="iv.XIX.17-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XIX.17-p1.1"></span>Chapter 17.—What Produces Peace, and What
Discord, Between the Heavenly and Earthly Cities.</span>

<span id="iv.XIX.17-p2"></span>But the families which do not live by
faith seek their peace in the earthly advantages of this life; while the
families which live by faith look for those eternal blessings which are
promised, and use as pilgrims such advantages of time and of earth as do
not fascinate and divert them from God, but rather aid them to endure
with greater ease, and to keep down the number of those burdens of the
corruptible body which weigh upon the soul.  Thus the things necessary
for this mortal life are used by both kinds of men and families alike,
but each has its own peculiar and widely different aim in using them. 
The earthly city, which does not live by faith, seeks an earthly peace,
and the end it proposes, in the well-ordered concord of civic obedience
and rule, is the combination of men’s wills to attain the things which
are helpful to this life.  The heavenly city, or rather the part of it
which sojourns on earth and lives by faith, makes use of this peace only
because it must, until this mortal condition which necessitates it shall
pass away.  Consequently, so long as it lives like a captive and a
stranger in the earthly city, though it has already received the promise
of redemption, and the gift of the Spirit as the earnest of it, it makes
no scruple to obey the laws of the earthly city, whereby the things
necessary for the maintenance of this mortal life are administered; and
thus, as this life is common to both cities, so there is a harmony
between them in regard to what belongs to it.  But, as the earthly city
has had some philosophers whose doctrine is condemned by the divine
teaching, and who, being deceived either by their own conjectures or by
demons, supposed that many gods must be invited to take an interest in
human affairs, and assigned to each a separate function and a separate
department,—to one the body, to another the soul; and in the body
itself, to one the head, to another the neck, and each of the other
members to one of the gods; and in like manner, in the soul, to one god
the natural capacity was assigned, to another education, to another
anger, to another lust; and so the various affairs of life were
assigned,—cattle to one, corn to another, wine to another, oil to
another, the woods to another, money to another, navigation to another,
wars and victories to another, marriages to another, births and
fecundity to another, and other things to other gods:  and as the
celestial city, on the other hand, knew that one God only was to be
worshipped, and that to Him alone was due that service which the Greeks
call <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.XIX.17-p2.1"></span>λατρεία</span>, and which can be given only
to a god, it has come to pass that the two cities could not have common
laws of religion, and that the heavenly city has been compelled in this
matter to dissent, and to become obnoxious to those who think
differently, and to stand the brunt of their anger and hatred and
persecutions, except in so far as the minds of their enemies have been
alarmed by the multitude of the Christians and quelled by the manifest
protection of God accorded to them.  This heavenly city, then, while it
sojourns on earth, calls citizens out of all nations, and gathers
together a society of pilgrims of all languages, not scrupling about
diversities in <span id="page_413">p. 413</span> <span
id="iv.XIX.17-Page_413"></span> the manners, laws, and institutions
whereby earthly peace is secured and maintained, but recognizing that,
however various these are, they all tend to one and the same end of
earthly peace.  It therefore is so far from rescinding and abolishing
these diversities, that it even preserves and adopts them, so long only
as no hindrance to the worship of the one supreme and true God is thus
introduced.  Even the heavenly city, therefore, while in its state of
pilgrimage, avails itself of the peace of earth, and, so far as it can
without injuring faith and godliness, desires and maintains a common
agreement among men regarding the acquisition of the necessaries of
life, and makes this earthly peace bear upon the peace of heaven; for
this alone can be truly called and esteemed the peace of the reasonable
creatures, consisting as it does in the perfectly ordered and harmonious
enjoyment of God and of one another in God.  When we shall have reached
that peace, this mortal life shall give place to one that is eternal,
and our body shall be no more this animal body which by its corruption
weighs down the soul, but a spiritual body feeling no want, and in all
its members subjected to the will.  In its pilgrim state the heavenly
city possesses this peace by faith; and by this faith it lives
righteously when it refers to the attainment of that peace every good
action towards God and man; for the life of the city is a social life.
