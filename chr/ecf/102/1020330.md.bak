<span id="iv.XI.26-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XI.26-p1.1"></span>Chapter 26.—Of the Image of the Supreme
Trinity, Which We Find in Some Sort in Human Nature Even in Its Present
State.</span>

<span id="iv.XI.26-p2"></span>And we indeed recognize in ourselves the
image of God, that is, of the supreme Trinity, an image which, though it
be not equal to God, or rather, though it be very far removed from
Him,—being neither co-eternal, nor, to say all in a word, consubstantial
with Him,—is yet nearer to Him in nature than any other of His works,
and is destined to be yet restored, that it may bear a still closer
resemblance.  For we both are, and know that we are, and delight in our
being, and our knowledge of it.  Moreover, in these three things no
true-seeming illusion disturbs us; for we do not come into contact with
these by some bodily sense, as we perceive the things outside of
us,—colors, *e.g*., by seeing, sounds by hearing, smells by smelling,
tastes by tasting, hard and soft objects by touching,—of all which
sensible objects it is the images resembling them, but not themselves
which we perceive in the mind and hold in the memory, and which excite
us to desire the objects.  But, without any delusive representation of
images or phantasms, I am most certain that I am, and that I know and
delight in this.  In respect of these truths, I am not at all afraid of
the arguments of the Academicians, who say, What if you are deceived? 
For if I am deceived, I am. <span id="fr_497"></span>[498](#fn_497.md)  
For he who is not, cannot be deceived; and if I am deceived, by this
same token I am.  And since I am if I am deceived, how am I deceived in
believing that I am? for it is certain that I am if I am deceived. 
Since, therefore, I, the person deceived, should be, even if I were
deceived, certainly I am not deceived in this knowledge that I am.  And,
consequently, neither am I deceived in knowing that I know. For, as I
know that I am, so I know this also, that I know.  And when I love these
two things, I add to them a certain third thing, namely, my love, which
is of equal moment.  For neither am I deceived in this, that I love,
since in those things which I love I am not deceived; though even if
these were false, it would still be true that I *loved* false things. 
For how could I justly be blamed and prohibited from loving false
things, if it were false that I loved them?  But, since they are true
and real, who doubts that when they are loved, the love of them is
itself true and real?  Further, as there is no one who does not wish to
be happy, so there is no one who does not wish to be.  For how can he be
happy, if he is nothing?

<span id="iv.XI.26-p3"></span> This is one of the passages cited by Sir
William Hamilton, along with the *Cogito, ergo sum* of Descartes, in
confirmation of his proof, that in so far as we are *conscious* of
certain modes of existence, in so far we possess an absolute certainty
that we exist.  See note A in Hamilton’s *Reid*, p. 744.
