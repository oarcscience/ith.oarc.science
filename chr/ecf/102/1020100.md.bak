id="iv.III.27-p1.1"></span>Chapter 27.—Of the Civil War Between Marius
and Sylla.</span>

<span id="iv.III.27-p2"></span>But when Marius, stained with the blood
of his fellow-citizens, whom the rage of party had sacrificed, was in
his turn vanquished and driven from the city, it had scarcely time to
breathe freely, when, to use the words of Cicero, “Cinna and Marius
together returned and took possession of it.  Then, indeed, the foremost
men in the state were put to death, its lights quenched.  Sylla
afterwards avenged this cruel victory; but we need not say with what
loss of life, and with what ruin to the republic.” <span
id="fr_156"></span>[157](#fn_156.md)   For of this vengeance, which was
more destructive than if the crimes which it punished had been committed
with impunity, Lucan says:  “The cure was excessive, and too closely
resembled the disease.  The guilty perished, but when none but the
guilty survived:  and then private hatred and anger, unbridled by law,
were allowed free indulgence.” <span id="fr_157"></span>[158](#fn_157.md)  
In that war between Marius and Sylla, besides those who fell in the
field of battle, the city, too, was filled with corpses in its streets,
squares, markets, theatres, and temples; so that it is not easy to
reckon whether the victors slew more before or after victory, that they
might be, or because they were, victors.  As soon as Marius triumphed,
and returned from exile, besides the butcheries everywhere perpetrated,
the head of the consul Octavius was exposed on the rostrum; Cæsar and
Fimbria were assassinated in their own houses; the two Crassi, father
and son, were murdered in one another’s sight; Bebius and Numitorius
were disembowelled by being dragged with hooks; Catulus escaped the
hands of his enemies by drinking poison; Merula, the flamen of Jupiter,
cut his veins and made a libation of his own blood to his god. 
Moreover, every one whose salutation Marius did not answer by giving his
hand, was at once cut down before his face.
