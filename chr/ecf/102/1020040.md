id="iv.ii.xxxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 34.—Of God’s Clemency in Moderating
the Ruin of the City.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.xxxv-p2"></span>And that you are yet alive is due to
God, who spares you that you may be admonished to repent and reform your
lives.  It is He who has permitted you, ungrateful as you are, to escape
the sword of the enemy, by calling yourselves His servants, or by
finding asylum in the sacred places of the martyrs.

<span id="iv.ii.xxxv-p3"></span>It is said that Romulus and Remus, in
order to increase the population of the city they founded, opened a
sanctuary in which every man might find asylum and absolution of all
crime,—a remarkable foreshadowing of what has recently occurred in honor
of Christ.  The destroyers of Rome followed the example of its
founders.  But it was not greatly to their credit that the latter, for
the sake of increasing the number of their citizens, did that which the
former have done, lest the number of their enemies should be diminished.
