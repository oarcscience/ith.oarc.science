id="iv.IV.9-p1.1"></span>Chapter 9.—Whether the Great Extent and Long
Duration of the Roman Empire Should Be Ascribed to Jove, Whom His
Worshippers Believe to Be the Chief God.</span>

<span id="iv.IV.9-p2"></span>Therefore omitting, or passing by for a
little, that crowd of petty gods, we ought to inquire into the part
performed by the great gods, whereby Rome has been made so great as to
reign so long over so many nations.  Doubtless, therefore, this is the
work of Jove.  For they will have it that he is the king of all the gods
and goddesses, as is shown by his sceptre and by the Capitol on the
lofty hill.  Concerning that god they publish a saying which, although
that of a poet, is most apt, “All things are full of Jove.” <span
id="fr_167"></span>[168](#fn_167)   Varro believes that this god is
worshipped, although called by another name, even by those who worship
one God alone without any image.  But if this is so, why has he been so
badly used at Rome (and indeed by other nations too), that an image of
him should be made?—a thing which was so displeasing to Varro himself,
that although he was overborne by the perverse custom of so great a
city, he had not the least hesitation in both saying and writing, that
those who have appointed images for the people have both taken away fear
and added error.
