<span id="iv.XXII.1-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XXII.1-p1.1"></span>Chapter 1.—Of the Creation of Angels and
Men.</span>

<span id="iv.XXII.1-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.XXII.1-p2.1"></span>As</span> we promised in the immediately
preceeding book, this, the last of the whole work, shall contain a
discussion of the eternal blessedness of the city of God.  This
blessedness is named eternal, not because it shall endure for many ages,
though at last it shall come to an end, but because, according to the
words of the gospel, “of His kingdom there shall be no end.” <span
id="fr_1602"></span>[1603](#fn_1602.md)   Neither shall it enjoy the mere
appearance of perpetuity which is maintained by the rise of fresh
generations to occupy the place of those that have died out, as in an
evergreen the same freshness seems to continue permanently, and the same
appearance of dense foliage is preserved by the growth of fresh leaves
in the room of those that have withered and fallen; but in that city all
the citizens shall be immortal, men now for the first time enjoying what
the holy angels have never lost.  And this shall be accomplished by God,
the most almighty Founder of the city.  For He has promised it, and
cannot lie, and has already performed many of His promises, and has done
many unpromised kindnesses to those whom He now asks to believe that He
will do this also.

<span id="iv.XXII.1-p4"></span>For it is He who in the beginning created
the world full of all visible and intelligible beings, among which He
created nothing better than those spirits whom He endowed with
intelligence, and made capable of contemplating and enjoying Him, and
united in our society, which we call the holy and heavenly city, and in
which the material of their sustenance and blessedness is God Himself,
as it were their common food and nourishment.  It is He who gave to this
intellectual nature free-will of such a kind, that if he wished to
forsake God, *i.e*., his blessedness, misery should forthwith result. 
It is He who, when He foreknew that certain angels would in their pride
desire to suffice for their own blessedness, and would forsake their
great good, did not deprive them of this power, deeming it to be more
befitting His power and goodness to bring good out of evil than to
prevent the evil from coming into existence.  And indeed evil had never
been, had not the mutable nature—mutable, though good, and created by
the most high God and immutable Good, who created all things
good—brought evil upon itself by sin.  And this its sin is itself proof
that its nature was originally good.  For had it not been very good,
though not equal to its Creator, the desertion of God as its light could
not have been an evil to it.  For as blindness is a vice of the eye, and
this very fact indicates that the eye was created to see the light, and
as, consequently, vice itself proves that the eye is more excellent than
the other members, because it is capable of light (for on no other
supposition would it be a vice of the eye to want light), so the nature
which once enjoyed God teaches, even by its very vice, that it was
created the best of all, since it is now miserable because it does not
enjoy God.  It is he who with very just punishment doomed the angels who
voluntarily fell to everlasting misery, and rewarded those who continued
in their attachment to the supreme good with the assurance of endless
stability as the meed of their fidelity.  It is He who made also man
himself <span id="page_480">p. 480</span> <span
id="iv.XXII.1-Page_480"></span> upright, with the same freedom of
will,—an earthly animal, indeed, but fit for heaven if he remained
faithful to his Creator, but destined to the misery appropriate to such
a nature if he forsook Him.  It is He who when He foreknew that man
would in his turn sin by abandoning God and breaking His law, did not
deprive him of the power of free-will, because He at the same time
foresaw what good He Himself would bring out of the evil, and how from
this mortal race, deservedly and justly condemned, He would by His grace
collect, as now He does, a people so numerous, that He thus fills up and
repairs the blank made by the fallen angels, and that thus that beloved
and heavenly city is not defrauded of the full number of its citizens,
but perhaps may even rejoice in a still more overflowing population.
