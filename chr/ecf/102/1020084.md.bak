<span id="iv.III.11-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.III.11-p1.1"></span>Chapter 11.—Of the Statue of Apollo at Cumæ,
Whose Tears are Supposed to Have Portended Disaster to the Greeks, Whom
the God Was Unable to Succor.</span>

<span id="iv.III.11-p2"></span>And it is still this weakness of the gods
which is confessed in the story of the Cuman Apollo, who is said to have
wept for four days during the war with the Achæans and King
Aristonicus.  And when the augurs were alarmed at the portent, and had
determined to cast the statue into the sea, the old men of Cumæ
interposed, and related that a similar prodigy had occurred to the same
image during the wars against Antiochus and against Perseus, and that by
a decree of the senate, gifts had been presented to Apollo, because
<span id="page_48">p. 48</span> <span id="iv.III.11-Page_48"></span> the
event had proved favorable to the Romans.  Then soothsayers were
summoned who were supposed to have greater professional skill, and they
pronounced that the weeping of Apollo’s image was propitious to the
Romans, because Cumæ was a Greek colony, and that Apollo was bewailing
(and thereby presaging) the grief and calamity that was about to light
upon his own land of Greece, from which he had been brought.  Shortly
afterwards it was reported that King Aristonicus was defeated and made
prisoner,—a defeat certainly opposed to the will of Apollo; and this he
indicated by even shedding tears from his marble image.  And this shows
us that, though the verses of the poets are mythical, they are not
altogether devoid of truth, but describe the manners of the demons in a
sufficiently fit style.  For in Virgil, Diana mourned for Camilla, <span
id="fr_135"></span>[136](#fn_135.md) and Hercules wept for Pallas doomed to
die. <span id="fr_136"></span>[137](#fn_136.md)   This is perhaps the
reason why Numa Pompilius, too, when, enjoying prolonged peace, but
without knowing or inquiring from whom he received it, he began in his
leisure to consider to what gods he should entrust the safe keeping and
conduct of Rome, and not dreaming that the true, almighty, and most high
God cares for earthly affairs, but recollecting only that the Trojan
gods which Æneas had brought to Italy had been able to preserve neither
the Trojan nor Lavinian kingdom rounded by Æneas himself, concluded that
he must provide other gods as guardians of fugitives and helpers of the
weak, and add them to those earlier divinities who had either come over
to Rome with Romulus, or when Alba was destroyed.
