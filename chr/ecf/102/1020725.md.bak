id="v.iv.xxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 29.—We are to Desire and Endeavor
that All Men May Love God.</span>

<span id="v.iv.xxix-p2"></span>30. Now of all who can with us enjoy God,
we love partly those to whom we render services, partly those who render
services to us, partly those who both help us in our need and in turn
are helped by us, partly those upon whom we confer no advantage and from
whom we look for none.  We ought to desire, however, that they should
all join with us in loving God, and all the assistance that we either
give them or accept from them should tend to that one end.  For in the
theatres, dens of iniquity though they be, if a man is fond of a
particular actor, and enjoys his art as a great or even as the very
greatest good, he is fond of all who join with him in admiration of his
favorite, not for their own sakes, but for the sake of him whom they
admire in common; and the more fervent he is in his admiration, the more
he works in every way he can to secure new admirers for him, and the
more anxious he becomes to show him to others; and if he find any one
comparatively indifferent, he does all he can to excite his interest by
urging his favorite’s merits:  if, however, he meet with any one who
opposes him, he is exceedingly displeased by such a man’s contempt of
his favorite, and strives in every way he can to remove it.  Now, if
this be so, what does it become us to do who live in the fellowship of
the love of God, the enjoyment of whom is true happiness of life, to
whom all who love Him owe both their own existence and the love they
bear Him, concerning whom we have no fear that any one who comes to know
Him will be disappointed in Him, and who desires our love, not for any
gain to Himself, but that those who love Him may obtain an eternal
reward, even Himself whom they love?  And hence it is that we love even
our enemies.  For we do not fear them, seeing they cannot take away from
us what we love; but we pity them rather, because the more they hate us
the more are they separated from Him whom we love.  For if they would
turn to Him, they must of necessity love Him as the supreme good, and
love us too as partakers with them in so great a blessing.
