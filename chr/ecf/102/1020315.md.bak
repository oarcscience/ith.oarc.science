<span id="iv.XI.11-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XI.11-p1.1"></span>Chapter 11.—Whether the Angels that Fell
Partook of the Blessedness Which the Holy Angels Have Always Enjoyed
from the Time of Their Creation.</span>

<span id="iv.XI.11-p2"></span>And since these things are so, those
spirits whom we call angels were never at any time or in any way
darkness, but, as soon as they were made, were made light; yet they were
not so created in order that they might exist and live in any way
whatever, but were enlightened that they might live wisely and
blessedly.  Some of them, having turned away from this light, have not
won this wise and blessed life, which is certainly eternal, and
accompanied with the sure confidence of its eternity; but they have
still the life of reason, though darkened with folly, and this they
cannot lose even if they would.  But who can determine to what extent
they were partakers of that wisdom before they fell?  And how shall we
say that they participated in it equally with those who through it are
truly and fully blessed, resting in a true certainty of eternal
felicity?  For if they had <span id="page_212">p. 212</span> <span
id="iv.XI.11-Page_212"></span> equally participated in this true
knowledge, then the evil angels would have remained eternally blessed
equally with the good, because they were equally expectant of it.  For,
though a life be never so long, it cannot be truly called eternal if it
is destined to have an end; for it is called life inasmuch as it is
lived, but eternal because it has no end.  Wherefore, although
everything eternal is not therefore blessed (for hell-fire is eternal),
yet if no life can be truly and perfectly blessed except it be eternal,
the life of these angels was not blessed, for it was doomed to end, and
therefore not eternal, whether they knew it or not.  In the one case
fear, in the other ignorance, prevented them from being blessed.  And
even if their ignorance was not so great as to breed in them a wholly
false expectation, but left them wavering in uncertainty whether their
good would be eternal or would some time terminate, this very doubt
concerning so grand a destiny was incompatible with the plenitude of
blessedness which we believe the holy angels enjoyed.  For we do not so
narrow and restrict the application of the term “blessedness” as to
apply it to God only, <span id="fr_471"></span>[472](#fn_471.md) though
doubtless He is so truly blessed that greater blessedness cannot be;
and, in comparison of His blessedness, what is that of the angels,
though, according to their capacity, they be perfectly blessed?

<span id="iv.XI.11-p3"></span> Vives remarks that the ancients defined
blessedness as an absolutely perfect state in all good, peculiar to
God.  Perhaps Augustin had a reminiscence of the remarkable discussion
in the *Tusc. Disp*. lib. v., and the definition, *Neque ulla alia huic
verbo, quum beatum dicimus, subjecta notio est, nisi, secretis malis
omnibus, cumulata bonorum complexio*.
