<span id="iv.XVI.10-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XVI.10-p1.1"></span>Chapter 10.—Of the Genealogy of Shem, in
Whose Line the City of God is Preserved Till the Time of Abraham.</span>

<span id="iv.XVI.10-p2"></span>It is necessary, therefore, to preserve
the series of generations descending from Shem, for the sake of
exhibiting the city of God after the flood; as before the flood it was
exhibited in the series of generations descending from Seth.  And
therefore does divine Scripture, after exhibiting the earthly city as
Babylon or “Confusion,” revert to the patriarch Shem, and recapitulate
the generations from him to Abraham, specifying besides, the year in
which each father begat the son that belonged to this line, and how long
he lived.  And unquestionably it is this which fulfills the promise I
made, that it should appear why it is said of the sons of Heber, “The
name of the one was Peleg, for in his days the earth was divided.” <span
id="fr_884"></span>[885](#fn_884.md)   For what can we understand by the
division of the earth, if not the diversity of languages?  And,
therefore, omitting the other sons of Shem, who are not concerned in
this matter, Scripture gives the genealogy of those by whom the line
runs on to Abraham, as before the flood those are given who carried on
the line to Noah from Seth.  Accordingly this series of generations
begins thus:  “These are the generations of Shem:  Shem was an hundred
years old, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood.  And Shem lived
after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and begat sons and
daughters.”  In like manner it registers the rest, naming the year of
his life in which each begat the son who belonged to that line which
extends to Abraham.  It specifies, too, how many years he lived
thereafter, begetting sons and daughters, that we may not childishly
suppose that the men named were the only men, but may understand how the
population increased, and how regions and kingdoms so vast could be
populated by the descendants of Shem; especially the kingdom of Assyria,
from which Ninus subdued the surrounding nations, reigning with
brilliant prosperity, and bequeathing to his descendants a vast but
thoroughly consolidated empire, which held together for many centuries.

<span id="iv.XVI.10-p4"></span>But to avoid needless prolixity, we shall
mention not the number of years each member of this series lived, but
only the year of his life in which he begat his heir, that we may thus
reckon the number of years from the flood to Abraham, and may at the
same time leave room to touch briefly and cursorily upon some other
matters necessary to our argument.  In the second year, then, after the
flood, Shem when he was a hundred years old begat Arphaxad; Arphaxad
when he was 135 years old begat Cainan; Cainan when he was 130 years
begat Salah.  Salah himself, too, was the same age when he begat Eber. 
Eber lived 134 years, and begat Peleg, in whose days the earth was
divided.  Peleg himself lived 130 years, and begat Reu; and Reu lived
132 years, and begat Serug; Serug 130, and begat Nahor; and Nahor 79,
and begat Terah; and Terah 70, and begat Abram, whose name God
afterwards changed into *Abraham*.  There are thus from the flood to
Abraham 1072 years, according to the Vulgate or Septuagint versions.  In
the Hebrew copies far fewer years are given; and for this either no
reason or a not very credible one is given.

<span id="iv.XVI.10-p5"></span>When, therefore, we look for the city of
God in these seventy-two nations, we cannot affirm that while they had
but one lip, that is, one language, the human race had departed from the
worship of the true God, and that genuine godliness had survived only in
those generations which descend from Shem through Arphaxad and reach to
Abraham; but from the time when they proudly built a tower to heaven, a
symbol of godless exaltation, the city or society of the wicked becomes
apparent.  Whether it was only disguised before, or non-existent;
whether both cities remained after the flood,—the godly in the two sons
of Noah who were blessed, and in their posterity, and the ungodly in the
cursed son and his descendants, from whom sprang that mighty hunter
against the Lord,—is not easily determined.  For possibly—and certainly
this is more credible—there were despisers of God among the descendants
of the two sons, even before Babylon was founded, and worshippers of God
among the descendants of Ham.  Certainly neither race was ever
obliterated from earth.  For in both the Psalms in which it is said,
“They are all gone aside, <span id="page_317">p. 317</span> <span
id="iv.XVI.10-Page_317"></span> they are altogether become filthy; there
is none that doeth good, no, not one,” we read further, “Have all the
workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people as they eat
bread, and call not upon the Lord.” <span
id="fr_885"></span>[886](#fn_885.md)   There was then a people of God even
at that time.  And therefore the words, “There is none that doeth good,
no, not one,” were said of the sons of men, not of the sons of God.  For
it had been previously said, “God looked down from heaven upon the sons
of men, to see if any understood and sought after God;” and then follow
the words which demonstrate that all the sons of men, that is, all who
belong to the city which lives according to man, not according to God,
are reprobate.
