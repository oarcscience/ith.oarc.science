<span id="iv.IV.34-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.IV.34-p1.1"></span>Chapter 34.—Concerning the Kingdom of the
Jews, Which Was Founded by the One and True God, and Preserved by Him as
Long as They Remained in the True Religion.</span>

<span id="iv.IV.34-p2"></span>Therefore, that it might be known that
these earthly good things, after which those pant who cannot imagine
better things, remain in the power of the one God Himself, not of the
many false gods whom the Romans have formerly believed worthy of
worship, He multiplied His people in Egypt from being very few, and
delivered them out of it by wonderful signs.  Nor did their women invoke
Lucina when their offspring was being incredibly multiplied; and that
nation having increased incredibly, He Himself delivered, He Himself
saved them from the hands of the Egyptians, who persecuted them, and
wished to kill all their infants.  Without the goddess Rumina they
sucked; without Cunina they were cradled, without Educa and Potina they
took food and drink; without all those puerile gods they were educated;
without the nuptial gods they were married; without the worship of
Priapus they had conjugal intercourse; without invocation of Neptune the
divided sea opened up a way for them to pass over, and overwhelmed with
its returning waves their enemies who pursued them.  Neither did they
consecrate any goddess Mannia when they received manna from heaven; nor,
when the smitten rock poured forth water to them when they thirsted, did
they worship Nymphs and Lymphs.  Without the mad rites of Mars and
Bellona they carried on war; and while, indeed, they did not <span
id="page_83">p. 83</span> <span id="iv.IV.34-Page_83"></span> conquer
without victory, yet they did not hold it to be a goddess, but the gift
of their God.  Without Segetia they had harvests; without Bubona, oxen;
honey without Mellona; apples without Pomona:  and, in a word,
everything for which the Romans thought they must supplicate so great a
crowd of false gods, they received much more happily from the one true
God.  And if they had not sinned against Him with impious curiosity,
which seduced them like magic arts, and drew them to strange gods and
idols, and at last led them to kill Christ, their kingdom would have
remained to them, and would have been, if not more spacious, yet more
happy, than that of Rome.  And now that they are dispersed through
almost all lands and nations, it is through the providence of that one
true God; that whereas the images, altars, groves, and temples of the
false gods are everywhere overthrown, and their sacrifices prohibited,
it may be shown from their books how this has been foretold by their
prophets so long before; lest, perhaps, when they should be read in
ours, they might seem to be invented by us.  But now, reserving what is
to follow for the following book, we must here set a bound to the
prolixity of this one.
