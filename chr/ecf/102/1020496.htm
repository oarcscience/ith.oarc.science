<p class="c34"><a name="iv.XVII.3-p1"></A><span class="c2"><a name="iv.XVII.3-p1.1"></A>Chapter 3.&#8212;Of the Three-Fold Meaning of the Prophecies, Which are to Be Referred Now to the Earthly, Now to the Heavenly Jerusalem, and Now Again to Both.</span></p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="iv.XVII.3-p2"></A>Wherefore just as that divine oracle to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and all the other prophetic signs or sayings which are given in the earlier sacred writings, so also the other prophecies from this time of the kings pertain partly to the nation of Abraham&#146;s flesh, and partly to that seed of his in which all nations are blessed as fellow-heirs of Christ by the New Testament, to the possessing of eternal life and the kingdom of the heavens.&#160; Therefore they pertain partly to the bond maid who gendereth to bondage, that is, the earthly Jerusalem, which is in bondage with her children; but partly to the free city of God, that is, the true Jerusalem eternal in the heavens, whose children are all those that live according to God in the earth:&#160; but there are some things among them which are understood to pertain to both,&#8212;to the bond maid properly, to the free woman figuratively.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_982"></A><A HREF="#fn_982"><FONT SIZE="1">983</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="iv.XVII.3-p4"></A>Therefore prophetic utterances of three kinds are to be found; forasmuch as there are some relating to the earthly Jerusalem, some to the heavenly, and some to both.&#160; I think it proper to prove what I say by examples.&#160; The prophet Nathan was sent to convict king David of heinous sin, and predict to him what future evils should be consequent on it.&#160; Who can question that this and the like pertain to the terrestrial city, whether publicly, that is, for the safety or help of the people, or privately, when there are given forth for each one&#146;s private good divine utterances whereby something of the future may be known for the use of temporal life?&#160; But where we read, &#8220;Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will make for the house of Israel, and for the house of Judah, a new testament:&#160; not according to the testament that I settled for their fathers in the day when I laid hold of their hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my testament, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.&#160; For this is the testament that I will make for the house of Israel:&#160; after those days, saith the Lord, I will give my laws in their mind, and will write them upon their hearts, and I will see to them; and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people;&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_983"></A><A HREF="#fn_983"><FONT SIZE="1">984</FONT></A>
&#8212;without doubt this is prophesied  <A NAME="page_339"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 339</FONT></A> <a name="iv.XVII.3-Page_339"></A>  to the Jerusalem above, whose reward is God Himself, and whose chief and entire good it is to have Him, and to be His.&#160; But this pertains to both, that the city of God is called Jerusalem, and that it is prophesied the house of God shall be in it; and this prophecy seems to be fulfilled when king Solomon builds that most noble temple.&#160; For these things both happened in the earthly Jerusalem, as history shows, and were types of the heavenly Jerusalem.&#160; And this kind of prophecy, as it were compacted and commingled of both the others in the ancient canonical books, containing historical narratives, is of very great significance, and has exercised and exercises greatly the wits of those who search holy writ.&#160; For example, what we read of historically as predicted and fulfilled in the seed of Abraham according to the flesh, we must also inquire the allegorical meaning of, as it is to be fulfilled in the seed of Abraham according to faith.&#160; And so much is this the case, that some have thought there is nothing in these books either foretold and effected, or effected although not foretold, that does not insinuate something else which is to be referred by figurative signification to the city of God on high, and to her children who are pilgrims in this life.&#160; But if this be so, then the utterances of the prophets, or rather the whole of those Scriptures that are reckoned under the title of the Old Testament, will be not of three, but of two different kinds.&#160; For there will be nothing there which pertains to the terrestrial Jerusalem only, if whatever is there said and fulfilled of or concerning her signifies something which also refers by allegorical prefiguration to the celestial Jerusalem; but there will be only two kinds one that pertains to the free Jerusalem, the other to both.&#160; But just as, I think, they err greatly who are of opinion that none of the records of affairs in that kind of writings mean anything more than that they so happened, so I think those very daring who contend that the whole gist of their contents lies in allegorical significations.&#160; Therefore I have said they are threefold, not two-fold.&#160; Yet, in holding this opinion, I do not blame those who may be able to draw out of everything there a spiritual meaning, only saving, first of all, the historical truth.&#160; For the rest, what believer can doubt that those things are spoken vainly which are such that, whether said to have been done or to be yet to come, they do not beseem either human or divine affairs?&#160; Who would not recall these to spiritual understanding if he could, or confess that they should be recalled by him who is able?</p>
