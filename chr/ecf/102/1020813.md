<span id="v.vi.xxxiii-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="v.vi.xxxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 33.—The Third Rule of
Tichonius.</span>

<span id="v.vi.xxxiii-p2"></span>46.  The third rule relates to the
*promises and the law*, and may be designated in other terms as relating
to the spirit and the letter, which is the name I made use of when
writing a book on this subject.  It may be also named, of grace and the
law.  This, however, seems to me to be a great question in itself,
rather than a rule to be applied to the solution of other questions.  It
was the want of clear views on this question that originated, or at
least greatly aggravated, the Pelagian heresy.  And the efforts of
Tichonius to clear up this point were good, but not complete.  For, in
discussing the question about faith and works, he said that works were
given us by God as the reward of faith, but that faith itself was so far
our own that it did not come to us from God; not keeping in mind the
saying of the apostle:  “Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith,
from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.” <span
id="fr_1904"></span>[1905](#fn_1904)   But he had not come into contact
with this heresy, which has arisen in our time, and has given us much
labor and trouble in defending against it the grace of God which is
through our Lord Jesus Christ, and which (according to the saying of the
apostle, “There must be also heresies among you, that they which are
approved may be made manifest among you” <span
id="fr_1905"></span>[1906](#fn_1905) ) has made us much more watchful
and diligent to discover in Scripture what escaped Tichonius, who,
having no enemy to guard against, was less attentive and anxious on this
point, namely, that even faith itself is the gift of Him who “hath dealt
to every man the measure of faith.” <span
id="fr_1906"></span>[1907](#fn_1906)   Whence it is said to certain
believers:  “Unto you it is given, in the behalf of Christ, not only to
believe on Him, but also to suffer for His sake.” <span
id="fr_1907"></span>[1908](#fn_1907)   Who, then, can doubt that each of
these is the gift of God, when he learns from this passage, and
believes, that each of them is given?  There are many other testimonies
besides which prove this.  But I am not now treating of this doctrine. 
I have, however, dealt with it, one place or another, very frequently.
