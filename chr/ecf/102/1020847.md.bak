<span id="v.IV_1.29"></span>

<span id="v.IV_1.29-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="v.IV_1.29-p1.1"></span>Chapter 29.—It is Permissible for a Preacher
to Deliver to the People What Has Been Written by a More Eloquent Man
Than Himself.</span>

<span id="v.IV_1.29-p2"></span>If, however, he cannot do even this, let
his life be such as shall not only secure a reward for himself, but
afford an example to others; and let his manner of living be an eloquent
sermon in itself.

<span id="v.IV_1.29-p3"></span>63.  There are, indeed, some men who have
a good delivery, but cannot compose anything to deliver.  Now, if such
men take what has been written with wisdom and eloquence by others, and
commit it to memory, and deliver it to the people, they cannot be
blamed, supposing them to do it without deception.  For in this way many
become preachers of the truth (which is certainly desirable), and yet
not many teachers; for all deliver the discourse which one real teacher
has composed, and there are no divisions among them.  Nor are such men
to be alarmed by the words of Jeremiah the prophet, through whom God
denounces those who steal His words every one from his neighbor. <span
id="fr_2018"></span>[2019](#fn_2018.md)   For those who steal take what
does not belong to them, but the word of God belongs to all who obey it;
and it is the man who speaks well, but lives badly, who really takes the
words that belong to another.  For the good things he says seem to be
the result of his own thought, and yet they have nothing in common with
his manner of life.  And so God has said that they steal His words who
would appear good by speaking God’s words, but are in fact bad, as they
follow their own ways.  And if you look closely into the matter, it is
not really themselves who say the good things they say.  For how can
they say in words what they deny in <span id="page_597">p. 597</span>
<span id="v.IV_1.29-Page_597"></span>deeds?  It is not for nothing that
the apostle says of such men:  “They profess that they know God, but in
works they deny Him.” <span id="fr_2019"></span>[2020](#fn_2019.md)   In
one sense, then, they do say the things, and in another sense they do
not say them; for both these statements must be true, both being made by
Him who is the Truth.  Speaking of such men, in one place He says,
“Whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do; but do not ye
after their works;”—that is to say, what ye hear from their lips, that
do; what ye see in their lives, that do ye not;—“for they say and do
not.” <span id="fr_2020"></span>[2021](#fn_2020.md)   And so, though they
do not, yet they say.  But in another place, upbraiding such men, He
says, “O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good
things?” <span id="fr_2021"></span>[2022](#fn_2021.md)   And from this it
would appear that even what they say, when they say what is good, it is
not themselves who say, for in will and in deed they deny what they
say.  Hence it happens that a wicked man who is eloquent may compose a
discourse in which the truth is set forth to be delivered by a good man
who is not eloquent; and when this takes place, the former draws from
himself what does not belong to him, and the latter receives from
another what really belongs to himself.  But when true believers render
this service to true believers, both parties speak what is their own,
for God is theirs, to whom belongs all that they say; and even those who
could not compose what they say make it their own by composing their
lives in harmony with it.
