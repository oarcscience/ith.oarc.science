<span id="iv.X.10-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.X.10-p1.1"></span>Chapter 10.—Concerning Theurgy, Which Promises
a Delusive Purification of the Soul by the Invocation of Demons.</span>

<span id="iv.X.10-p2"></span>But here we have another and a much more
learned Platonist than Apuleius, Porphyry, to wit, asserting that, by I
know not what theurgy, even the gods themselves are subjected to
passions and perturbations; for by adjurations they were so bound and
terrified that they could not confer purity of soul,—were so terrified
by him who imposed on them a wicked command, that they could not by the
same theurgy be freed from that terror, and fulfill the righteous behest
of him who prayed to them, or do the good he sought.  Who does not see
that all these things are fictions of deceiving demons, unless he be a
wretched slave of theirs, and an alien from the grace of the true
Liberator?  For if the Chaldæan had been dealing with good gods,
certainly a well-disposed man, who sought to purify his own soul, would
have had more influence with them than an evil-disposed man seeking to
hinder him.  Or, if the gods were just, and considered the man unworthy
of the purification he sought, at all events they should not have been
terrified by an envious person, nor hindered, as Porphyry avows, by the
fear of a stronger deity, but should have simply denied the boon on
their own free judgment.  And it is surprising that that well-disposed
Chaldæan, who desired to purify his soul by theurgical rites, found no
superior deity who could either terrify the frightened gods still more,
and force them to confer the boon, or compose their fears, and so enable
them to do good without compulsion,—even supposing that the good
theurgist had no rites by which he himself might purge away the taint of
fear from the gods whom he invoked for the purification of his own
soul.  And why is it that there is a god who has power to terrify the
inferior gods, and none who has power to free them from fear?  Is there
found a god who listens to the envious man, and frightens the <span
id="page_187">p. 187</span> <span id="iv.X.10-Page_187"></span> gods
from doing good? and is there not found a god who listens to the
well-disposed man, and removes the fear of the gods that they may do him
good?  O excellent theurgy!  O admirable purification of the soul!—a
theurgy in which the violence of an impure envy has more influence than
the entreaty of purity and holiness.  Rather let us abominate and avoid
the deceit of such wicked spirits, and listen to sound doctrine.  As to
those who perform these filthy cleansings by sacrilegious rites, and see
in their initiated state (as he further tells us, though we may question
this vision) certain wonderfully lovely appearances of angels or gods,
this is what the apostle refers to when he speaks of “Satan transforming
himself into an angel of light.” <span id="fr_403"></span>[404](#fn_403.md)
  For these are the delusive appearances of that spirit who longs to
entangle wretched souls in the deceptive worship of many and false gods,
and to turn them aside from the true worship of the true God, by whom
alone they are cleansed and healed, and who, as was said of Proteus,
“turns himself into all shapes,” <span id="fr_404"></span>[405](#fn_404.md)
equally hurtful, whether he assaults us as an enemy, or assumes the
disguise of a friend.
