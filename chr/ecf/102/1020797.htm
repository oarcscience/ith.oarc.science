<p class="c34"><a name="v.vi.xvii-p1"></A><span class="c2"><a name="v.vi.xvii-p1.1"></A>Chapter 17.&#8212;Some Commands are Given to All in Common, Others to Particular Classes.</span></p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="v.vi.xvii-p2"></A>25.&#160; Again, it often happens that a man who has attained, or thinks he has attained, to a higher grade of spiritual life, thinks that the commands given to those who are still in the lower grades are figurative; for example, if he has embraced a life of celibacy and made himself a eunuch for the kingdom of heaven&#146;s sake, he contends that the commands given in Scripture about loving and ruling a wife are not to be taken literally, but figuratively; and if he has determined to keep his virgin unmarried, he tries to put a figurative interpretation on the passage where it is said, &#8220;Marry thy daughter, and so shall thou have performed a weighty matter.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1870"></A><A HREF="#fn_1870"><FONT SIZE="1">1871</FONT></A>
&#160; Accordingly, another of our rules for understanding the Scriptures will be as follows,&#8212;to recognize that some commands are given to all in common, others to particular classes of persons, that the medicine may act not only upon the state of health as a whole, but also upon the special weakness of each member.&#160; For that which cannot be raised to a higher state must be cared for in its own state.</p>
