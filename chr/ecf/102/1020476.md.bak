<span id="iv.XVI.27-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XVI.27-p1.1"></span>Chapter 27.—Of the Male, Who Was to Lose His
Soul If He Was Not Circumcised on the Eighth Day, Because He Had Broken
God’s Covenant.</span>

<span id="iv.XVI.27-p2"></span>When it is said, “The male who is not
circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, that soul shall be cut off
from his people, because he hath broken my covenant,” <span
id="fr_921"></span>[922](#fn_921.md) some may be troubled how that ought to
be understood, since it can be no fault of the infant whose life it is
said must perish; nor has the covenant of God been broken by him, but by
his parents, who have not taken care to circumcise him.  But even the
infants, not personally in their own life, but according to the common
origin of the human race, have all broken God’s covenant in that one in
whom all have sinned. <span id="fr_922"></span>[923](#fn_922.md)   Now
there are many things called God’s covenants besides those two great
ones, the old and the new, which any one who pleases may read and know. 
For the first covenant, which was made with the first man, is just
this:  “In the day ye eat thereof, ye shall surely die.” <span
id="fr_923"></span>[924](#fn_923.md)   Whence it is written in the book
called Ecclesiasticus, “All flesh waxeth old as doth a garment.  For the
covenant from the beginning is, Thou shall die the death.” <span
id="fr_924"></span>[925](#fn_924.md)   Now, as the law was more plainly
given afterward, and the apostle says, “Where no law is, there is no
prevarication,” <span id="fr_925"></span>[926](#fn_925.md) on what
supposition is what is said in the psalm true, “I accounted all the
sinners of the earth prevaricators,” <span
id="fr_926"></span>[927](#fn_926.md) except that all who are held liable
for any sin are accused of dealing deceitfully (prevaricating) with some
law?  If on this account, then, even the infants are, according to the
true belief, born in sin, not actual but original, so that we confess
they have need of grace for the remission of sins, certainly it must be
acknowledged that in the same sense in which they are sinners they are
also prevaricators of that law which was given in Paradise, according to
the truth of both scriptures, “I accounted all the sinners of the earth
prevaricators,” and “Where no law is, there is no prevarication.”  And
thus, be <span id="page_327">p. 327</span> <span
id="iv.XVI.27-Page_327"></span> cause circumcision was the sign of
regeneration, and the infant, on account of the original sin by which
God’s covenant was first broken, was not undeservedly to lose his
generation unless delivered by regeneration, these divine words are to
be understood as if it had been said, Whoever is not born again, that
soul shall perish from his people, because he hath broken my covenant,
since he also has sinned in Adam with all others.  For had He said,
Because he hath broken this my covenant, He would have compelled us to
understand by it only this of circumcision; but since He has not
expressly said what covenant the infant has broken, we are free to
understand Him as speaking of that covenant of which the breach can be
ascribed to an infant.  Yet if any one contends that it is said of
nothing else than circumcision, that in it the infant has broken the
covenant of God because, he is not circumcised, he must seek some method
of explanation by which it may be understood without absurdity (such as
this) that he has broken the covenant, because it has been broken in him
although not by him.  Yet in this case also it is to be observed that
the soul of the infant, being guilty of no sin of neglect against
itself, would perish unjustly, unless original sin rendered it obnoxious
to punishment.
