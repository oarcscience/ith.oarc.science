<span id="iv.XVI.16-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XVI.16-p1.1"></span>Chapter 16.—Of the Order and Nature of the
Promises of God Which Were Made to Abraham.</span>

<span id="iv.XVI.16-p2"></span>God’s promises made to Abraham are now to
be considered; for in these the oracles of our God, <span
id="fr_900"></span>[901](#fn_900) that is, of the true God, began to
appear more openly concerning the godly <span id="page_321">p.
321</span> <span id="iv.XVI.16-Page_321"></span> people, whom prophetic
authority foretold.  The first of these reads thus:  “And the Lord said
unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from
thy father’s house, and go into a land that I will show thee:  and I
will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee and magnify thy
name; and thou shall be blessed:  and I will bless them that bless thee,
and curse them that curse thee:  and in thee shall all tribes of the
earth be blessed.” <span id="fr_901"></span>[902](#fn_901)   Now it is
to be observed that two things are promised to Abraham, the one, that
his seed should possess the land of Canaan, which is intimated when it
is said, “Go into a land that I will show thee, and I will make of thee
a great nation;” but the other far more excellent, not about the carnal
but the spiritual seed, through which he is the father, not of the one
Israelite nation, but of all nations who follow the footprints of his
faith, which was first promised in these words, “And in thee shall all
tribes of the earth be blessed.”  Eusebius thought this promise was made
in Abraham’s seventy-fifth year, as if soon after it was made Abraham
had departed out of Haran because the Scripture cannot be contradicted
in which we read, “Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed
out of Haran.”  But if this promise was made in that year, then of
course Abraham was staying in Haran with his father; for he could not
depart thence unless he had first dwelt there.  Does this, then,
contradict what Stephen says, “The God of glory appeared to our father
Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Charran?” <span
id="fr_902"></span>[903](#fn_902)   But it is to be understood that the
whole took place in the same year,—both the promise of God before
Abraham dwelt in Haran, and his dwelling in Haran, and his departure
thence,—not only because Eusebius in the Chronicles reckons from the
year of this promise, and shows that after 430 years the exodus from
Egypt took place, when the law was given, but because the Apostle Paul
also mentions it.
