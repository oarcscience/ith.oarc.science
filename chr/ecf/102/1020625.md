<span id="iv.XX.23-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XX.23-p1.1"></span>Chapter 23.—What Daniel Predicted Regarding
the Persecution of Antichrist, the Judgment of God, and the Kingdom of
the Saints.</span>

<span id="iv.XX.23-p2"></span>Daniel prophesies of the last judgment in
such a way as to indicate that Antichrist shall first come, and to carry
on his description to the eternal reign of the saints.  For when in
prophetic vision he had seen four beasts, signifying four kingdoms, and
the fourth conquered by a certain king, who is recognized as Antichrist,
and after this the eternal kingdom of the Son of man, that is to say, of
Christ, he says, “My spirit was terrified, I Daniel in the midst of my
body, and the visions of my head troubled me,” <span
id="fr_1434"></span>[1435](#fn_1434) etc.  Some have interpreted these
four kingdoms as signifying those of the Assyrians, Persians,
Macedonians, and Romans.  They who desire to understand the fitness of
this interpretation may read Jerome’s book on Daniel, which is written
with a sufficiency of care and erudition.  But he who reads this
passage, even half asleep, cannot fail to see that the kingdom of
Antichrist shall fiercely, though for a short time, assail the Church
before the last judgment of God shall introduce the eternal reign of the
saints.  For it is patent from the context that the *time, times, and
half a time*, means a year, and two years, and half a year, that is to
say, three years and a half.  Sometimes in Scripture the same thing is
indicated by months.  For though the word *times* seems to be used here
in the Latin indefinitely, that is only because the Latins have no dual,
as the Greeks have, and as the Hebrews also are said to have.  Times,
therefore, is used for two times.  As for the ten kings, whom, as it
seems, Antichrist is to find in the person of ten individuals when he
comes, I own I am afraid we may be deceived in this, and that he may
come unexpectedly while there are not ten kings living in the Roman
world.  For what if this number ten signifies the whole number of kings
who are to precede his coming, as totality is frequently symbolized by a
thousand, or a hundred, or seven, or other numbers, which it is not
necessary to recount?

<span id="iv.XX.23-p4"></span>In another place the same Daniel says,
“And there shall be a time of trouble, such as was not since there was
born a nation upon earth until that time:  and in that time all Thy
people which shall be found written in the book shall be delivered.  And
many of them that sleep in the mound of earth shall arise, some to
everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting confusion.  And they
that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and many of
the just as the stars for ever.” <span
id="fr_1435"></span>[1436](#fn_1435)   This passage is very similar to
the one we have quoted from the Gospel, <span
id="fr_1436"></span>[1437](#fn_1436) at least so far as regards the
resurrection of dead bodies.  For those who are there said to be “in the
graves” are here spoken of as “sleeping in the mound of earth,” or, as
others translate, “in the dust of earth.”  There it is said, “They shall
come forth;” so here, “They shall arise.”  There, “They that have done
good, to the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, to the
resurrection of judgment;” here, “Some to everlasting life, and some to
shame and everlasting confusion.”  Neither is it to be supposed a
difference, though in place of the expression in the Gospel, “All who
are in their graves,” the prophet does not say “all,” but “many of them
that sleep in the mound of earth.”  For *many* is sometimes used in
Scripture for *all*.  Thus it was said to Abraham, “I have set thee as
the father of many nations,” though in another place it was said to him,
“In thy seed shall all nations be blessed.” <span
id="fr_1437"></span>[1438](#fn_1437)   Of such a resurrection it is said
a little afterwards to the prophet himself, “And come thou and rest: 
for there is yet a day till the completion of the consummation; and thou
shall rest, and rise in thy lot in the end of the days.” <span
id="fr_1438"></span>[1439](#fn_1438)
