<span id="v.iv.xxvii-p2"></span>28.  Now he is a man of just and holy
life who forms an unprejudiced estimate of things, and keeps his
affections also under strict control, so that he neither loves what he
ought not to love, nor fails to love what he ought to love, nor loves
that more which ought to be loved less, nor loves that equally which
ought to be loved either less or more, nor loves that less or more which
ought to be loved equally.  No sinner is to be loved as a sinner; and
every man is to be loved as a man for God’s sake; but God is to be loved
for His own sake.  And if God is to be loved more than any man, each man
ought to love God more than himself.  Likewise we ought to love another
man better than our own body, because all things are to be loved in
reference to God, and another man can have fellowship with us in the
enjoyment of God, whereas our body cannot; for the body only lives
through the soul, and it is by the soul that we enjoy God.
