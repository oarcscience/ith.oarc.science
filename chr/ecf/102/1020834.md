<span id="v.IV_1.16"></span>

<span id="v.IV_1.16-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="v.IV_1.16-p1.1"></span>Chapter 16.—Human Directions Not to Be
Despised, Though God Makes the True Teacher.</span>

<span id="v.IV_1.16-p2"></span>33.  Now if any one says that we need not
direct men how or what they should teach, since the Holy Spirit makes
them teachers, he may as well say that we need not pray, since our Lord
says, “Your Father knoweth what things ye have need of before ye ask
Him;” <span id="fr_1958"></span>[1959](#fn_1958.md) or that the Apostle
Paul should not have given directions to Timothy and Titus as to how or
what they should teach others.  And these three apostolic epistles ought
to be constantly before the eyes of every one who has obtained the
position of a teacher in the Church.  In the First Epistle to Timothy do
we not read:  “These things command and teach?” <span
id="fr_1959"></span>[1960](#fn_1959.md)   What these things are, has been
told previously.  Do we not read there:  “Rebuke not an elder, but
entreat him as a father?” <span id="fr_1960"></span>[1961](#fn_1960.md)  
Is it not said in the Second Epistle:  “Hold fast the form of sound
words, which thou hast heard of me?” <span
id="fr_1961"></span>[1962](#fn_1961.md)   And is he not be ashamed, rightly
dividing the word of truth?” <span id="fr_1962"></span>[1963](#fn_1962.md)
  And in the same place:  “Preach the word; be instant in season, out of
season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all long-suffering and
doctrine.” <span id="fr_1963"></span>[1964](#fn_1963.md)   And so in the
Epistle to Titus, does he not say that a bishop ought to “hold fast the
faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound
doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers?” <span
id="fr_1964"></span>[1965](#fn_1964.md)   There, too, he says:  “But speak
thou the things which become sound doctrine:  that the aged men be
sober,” and so on. <span id="fr_1965"></span>[1966](#fn_1965.md)   And
there, too:  “These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all
authority.  Let no man despise thee.  Put them in mind to be subject to
principalities and powers,” <span id="fr_1966"></span>[1967](#fn_1966.md)
and so on.  What then are we to think?  Does the apostle in any way
contradict himself, when, though he says that men are made teachers by
the operation of the Holy Spirit, he yet himself gives them directions
how and what they should teach?  Or are we to understand, that though
the duty of men to teach even the teachers does not cease when the Holy
Spirit is given, yet that neither is he who planteth anything, nor he
who watereth, but God who giveth the increase? <span
id="fr_1967"></span>[1968](#fn_1967.md)   Wherefore though holy men be our
helpers, or even holy angels assist us, no one learns aright the things
that pertain to life with God, until God makes him ready to learn from
Himself, that God who is thus addressed in the psalm:  “Teach me to do
Thy will; for Thou art my God.” <span
id="fr_1968"></span>[1969](#fn_1968.md)   And so the same apostle says to
Timothy himself, speaking, of course, as teacher to disciple:  “But
continue thou in the things which thou hast learned, and hast been
assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them.” <span
id="fr_1969"></span>[1970](#fn_1969.md)   For as the medicines which men
apply to the bodies of their fellow-men are of no avail except God gives
them virtue (who can heal without their aid, though they cannot without
His), and yet they are applied; and if it be done from a sense of duty,
it is esteemed a work of mercy or benevolence; so the aids of teaching,
applied through the instrumentality of man, are of advantage to the soul
only when God works to make them of advantage, who could give the gospel
to man even without the help or agency of men.
