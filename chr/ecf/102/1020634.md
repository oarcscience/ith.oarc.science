<span id="iv.XXI.1-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XXI.1-p1.1"></span>Chapter 1.—Of the Order of the Discussion,
Which Requires that We First Speak of the Eternal Punishment of the Lost
in Company with the Devil, and Then of the Eternal Happiness of the
Saints.</span>

<span id="iv.XXI.1-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.XXI.1-p2.1"></span>I Propose</span>, with such ability as God may
grant me, to discuss in this book more thoroughly the nature of the
punishment which shall be assigned to the devil and all his retainers,
when the two cities, the one of God, the other of the devil, shall have
reached their proper ends through Jesus Christ our Lord, the Judge of
quick and dead.  And I have adopted this order, and preferred to speak,
first of the punishment of the devils, and afterwards of the blessedness
of the saints, because the body partakes of either destiny; and it seems
to be more incredible that bodies endure in everlasting torments than
that they continue to exist without any pain in everlasting felicity. 
Consequently, when I shall have demonstrated that that punishment ought
not to be incredible, this will materially aid me in proving that which
is much more credible, viz., the immortality of the bodies of the saints
which are delivered from all pain.  Neither is this order out of harmony
with the divine writings, in which sometimes, indeed, the blessedness of
the good is placed first, as in the words, “They that have done good,
unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the
resurrection of judgment;” <span id="fr_1492"></span>[1493](#fn_1492.md)
but sometimes also last, as, “The Son of man shall send forth His
angels, and they shall gather out of His kingdom all things which
offend, and shall cast them into a furnace of fire:  there shall be
wailing and gnashing of teeth, Then shall the righteous shine forth as
the sun in the kingdom of His Father;” <span
id="fr_1493"></span>[1494](#fn_1493.md) and that, “These shall go away into
eternal punishment, but the righteous into life eternal.” <span
id="fr_1494"></span>[1495](#fn_1494.md)   And though we have not room to
cite instances, any one who examines the prophets will find that they
adopt now the one arrangement and now the other.  My own reason for
following the latter order I have given.
