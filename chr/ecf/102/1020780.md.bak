<span id="v.vi-p3"></span>Argument—The author, having discussed in the
preceding book the method of dealing with unknown signs, goes on in this
third book to treat of ambiguous signs.  Such signs may be either direct
or figurative.  In the case of direct signs ambiguity may arise from the
punctuation, the pronunciation, or the doubtful signification of the
words, and is to be resolved by attention to the context, a comparison
of translations, or a reference to the original tongue.  In the case of
figurative signs we need to guard against two mistakes:—1. the
interpreting literal expressions figuratively; 2. the interpreting
figurative expressions literally.  The author lays down rules by which
we may decide whether an expression is literal or figurative; the
general rule being, that whatever can be shown to be in its literal
sense inconsistent either with purity of life or correctness of doctrine
must be taken figuratively.  He then goes on to lay down rules for the
interpretation of expressions which have been proved to be figurative;
the general principle being, that no interpretation can be true which
does not promote the love of God and the love of man.  The author then
proceeds to expound and illustrate the seven rules of Tichonius the
Donatist, which he commends to the attention of the student of Holy
Scripture.
