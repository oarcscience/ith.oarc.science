id="iv.XV.25-p1.1"></span>Chapter 25.—Of the Anger of God, Which Does
Not Inflame His Mind, Nor Disturb His Unchangeable Tranquillity.</span>

<span id="iv.XV.25-p2"></span>The anger of God is not a disturbing
emotion of His mind, but a judgment by which punishment is inflicted
upon sin.  His thought and reconsideration also are the unchangeable
reason which changes things; for He does not, like man, repent of
anything He has done, because in all matters His decision is as
inflexible as His prescience is certain.  But if Scripture were not to
use such expressions as the above, it would not familiarly insinuate
itself into the minds of all classes of men, whom it seeks access to for
their good, that it may alarm the proud, arouse the careless, exercise
the inquisitive, and satisfy the intelligent; and this it could not do,
did it not first stoop, and in a manner descend, to them where they
lie.  But its denouncing death on all the animals of earth and air is a
declaration of the vastness of the disaster that was approaching:  not
that it threatens destruction to the irrational animals as if they too
had incurred it by sin.
