<span id="iv.XX.7-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XX.7-p1.1"></span>Chapter 7.—What is Written in the Revelation of
John Regarding the Two Resurrections, and the Thousand Years, and What
May Reasonably Be Held on These Points.</span>

<span id="iv.XX.7-p2"></span>The evangelist John has spoken of these two
resurrections in the book which is called the Apocalypse, but in such a
way that some Christians do not understand the first of the two, and so
construe the passage into ridiculous fancies.  For the Apostle John says
in the foresaid book, “And I saw an angel come down from heaven. . . .
Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection:  on
such the second death hath no power; but they shall be priests of God
and of Christ, and shall reign with Him a thousand years.” <span
id="fr_1338"></span>[1339](#fn_1338.md)   Those who, on the strength of
this passage, have suspected that the first resurrection is future and
bodily, have been moved, among other things, specially by the number of
a thousand years, as if it were a fit thing that the saints should thus
enjoy a kind of Sabbath-rest during that period, a holy leisure after
the labors of the six thousand years since man was created, and was on
account of his great sin dismissed from the blessedness of paradise into
the woes of this mortal life, so that thus, as it is written, “One day
is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one
day,” <span id="fr_1339"></span>[1340](#fn_1339.md) there should follow on
the completion of six thousand years, as of six days, a kind of
seventh-day Sabbath in the succeeding thousand years; and that it is for
this purpose the saints rise, viz., to celebrate this Sabbath.  And this
opinion would not be objectionable, if it were believed that the joys of
the saints in that Sabbath shall be spiritual, and consequent on the
presence of God; for I myself, too, once held this opinion. <span
id="fr_1340"></span>[1341](#fn_1340.md)   But, as they assert that those
who then rise again shall enjoy the leisure of immoderate carnal
banquets, furnished with an amount of meat and drink such as not only to
shock the feeling of the temperate, but even to surpass the measure of
credulity itself, such assertions can be believed only by the carnal. 
They who do believe them are called by the spiritual Chiliasts, which we
may literally reproduce by the name Millenarians. <span
id="fr_1341"></span>[1342](#fn_1341.md)   It were a tedious process to
refute these opinions point by point:  we prefer proceeding to show how
that passage of Scripture should be understood. <span
id="fr_1342"></span>[1343](#fn_1342.md)

<span id="iv.XX.7-p8"></span>The Lord Jesus Christ Himself says, “No man
can enter into a strong man’s house, and spoil his goods, except he
first bind the strong man” <span id="fr_1343"></span>[1344](#fn_1343.md)
—meaning by the strong man the devil, because he had power to take
captive the human race; and meaning by his goods which he was to take,
those who had been held by the devil in divers sins and iniquities, but
were to become believers in Himself.  It was then for the binding of
this strong one that the apostle saw in the Apocalypse “an angel coming
down from heaven, having the key of the abyss, and a chain in his hand. 
And he laid hold,” he says, “on the dragon, that old serpent, which is
called the devil and Satan, and bound him a thousand years,”—that is,
<span id="page_427">p. 427</span> <span id="iv.XX.7-Page_427"></span>
bridled and restrained his power so that he could not seduce and gain
possession of those who were to be freed.  Now the thousand years may be
understood in two ways, so far as occurs to me:  either because these
things happen in the sixth thousand of years or sixth millennium (the
latter part of which is now passing), as if during the sixth day, which
is to be followed by a Sabbath which has no evening, the endless rest of
the saints, so that, speaking of a part under the name of the whole, he
calls the last part of the millennium—the part, that is, which had yet
to expire before the end of the world—a thousand years; or he used the
thousand years as an equivalent for the whole duration of this world,
employing the number of perfection to mark the fullness of time.  For a
thousand is the cube of ten.  For ten times ten makes a hundred, that
is; the square on a plane superficies.  But to give this superficies
height, and make it a cube, the hundred is again multiplied by ten,
which gives a thousand.  Besides, if a hundred is sometimes used for
totality, as when the Lord said by way of promise to him that left all
and followed Him “He shall receive in this world an hundredfold;” <span
id="fr_1344"></span>[1345](#fn_1344.md) of which the apostle gives, as it
were, an explanation when he says, “As having nothing, yet possessing
all things,” <span id="fr_1345"></span>[1346](#fn_1345.md) —for even of old
it had been said, The whole world is the wealth of a believer,—with how
much greater reason is a thousand put for totality since it is the cube,
while the other is only the square?  And for the same reason we cannot
better interpret the words of the psalm, “He hath been mindful of His
covenant for ever, the word which He commanded to a thousand
generations,” <span id="fr_1346"></span>[1347](#fn_1346.md) than by
understanding it to mean “to all generations.”

<span id="iv.XX.7-p13"></span>“And he cast him into the abyss,”—*i.e*.,
cast the devil into the abyss.  By the *abyss* is meant the countless
multitude of the wicked whose hearts are unfathomably deep in malignity
against the Church of God; not that the devil was not there before, but
he is said to be cast in thither, because, when prevented from harming
believers, he takes more complete possession of the ungodly.  For that
man is more abundantly possessed by the devil who is not only alienated
from God, but also gratuitously hates those who serve God.  “And shut
him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no
more till the thousand years should be fulfilled.”  “Shut him
up,”—*i.e*., prohibited him from going out, from doing what was
forbidden.  And the addition of “set a seal upon him” seems to me to
mean that it was designed to keep it a secret who belonged to the
devil’s party and who did not.  For in this world this is a secret, for
we cannot tell whether even the man who seems to stand shall fall, or
whether he who seems to lie shall rise again.  But by the chain and
prison-house of this interdict the devil is prohibited and restrained
from seducing those nations which belong to Christ, but which he
formerly seduced or held in subjection.  For before the foundation of
the world God chose to rescue these from the power of darkness, and to
translate them into the kingdom of the Son of His love, as the apostle
says. <span id="fr_1347"></span>[1348](#fn_1347.md)   For what Christian is
not aware that he seduces nations even now, and draws them with himself
to eternal punishment, but not those predestined to eternal life?  And
let no one be dismayed by the circumstance that the devil often seduces
even those who have been regenerated in Christ, and begun to walk in
God’s way.  For “the Lord knoweth them that are His,” <span
id="fr_1348"></span>[1349](#fn_1348.md) and of these the devil seduces none
to eternal damnation.  For it is as God, from whom nothing is hid even
of things future, that the Lord knows them; not as a man, who sees a man
at the present time (if he can be said to see one whose heart he does
not see), but does not see even himself so far as to be able to know
what kind of person he is to be.  The devil, then, is bound and shut up
in the abyss that he may not seduce the nations from which the Church is
gathered, and which he formerly seduced before the Church existed.  For
it is not said “that he should not seduce any man,” but “that he should
not seduce the nations”—meaning, no doubt, those among which the Church
exists—“till the thousand years should be fulfilled,”—*i.e*., either
what remains of the sixth day which consists of a thousand years, or all
the years which are to elapse till the end of the world.

<span id="iv.XX.7-p16"></span>The words, “that he should not seduce the
nations till the thousand years should be fulfilled,” are not to be
understood as indicating that afterwards he is to seduce only those
nations from which the predestined Church is composed, and from seducing
whom he is restrained by that chain and imprisonment; but they are used
in conformity with that usage frequently employed in Scripture and
exemplified in the psalm, “So our eyes wait upon the Lord our God, until
He have mercy upon us,” <span id="fr_1349"></span>[1350](#fn_1349.md) —not
as if the eyes of His servants would no longer wait upon the Lord their
God when He had mercy upon them.  Or the order <span id="page_428">p.
428</span> <span id="iv.XX.7-Page_428"></span> of the words is
unquestionably this, “And he shut him up and set a seal upon him, till
the thousand years should be fulfilled;” and the interposed clause,
“that he should seduce the nations no more,” is not to be understood in
the connection in which it stands, but separately, and as if added
afterwards, so that the whole sentence might be read, “And He shut him
up and set a seal upon him till the thousand years should be fulfilled,
that he should seduce the nations no more,”—*i.e*., he is shut up till
the thousand years be fulfilled, on this account, that he may no more
deceive the nations.
