id="v.v.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 3.—Among Signs, Words Hold the Chief
Place.</span>

<span id="v.v.iii-p2"></span>4.  Of the signs, then, by which men
communicate their thoughts to one another, some relate to the sense of
sight, some to that of hearing, a very few to the other senses.  For,
when we nod, we give no sign except to the eyes of the man to whom we
wish by this sign to impart our desire.  And some convey a great deal by
the motion of the hands:  and actors by movements of all their limbs
give certain signs to the initiated, and, so to speak, address their
conversation to the eyes:  and the military standards and flags convey
through the eyes the will of the commanders.  And all these signs are as
it were a kind of visible words.  The signs that address themselves to
the ear are, as I have said, more numerous, and for the most part
consist of words.  For though the bugle and the flute and the lyre
frequently give not only a sweet but a significant sound, yet all these
signs are very few in number compared with words.  For among men words
have obtained far and away the chief place as a means of indicating the
thoughts of the mind.  Our Lord, it is true, gave a sign through the
odor of the ointment which was poured out upon His feet; <span
id="fr_1758"></span>[1759](#fn_1758) and in the sacrament of His body
and blood He signified His will through the sense of taste; and when by
touching the hem of His garment the woman was made whole, the act was
not wanting in significance. <span id="fr_1759"></span>[1760](#fn_1759)
  But the countless multitude of the signs through which men express
their thoughts consist of words.  For I have been able to put into words
all those signs, the various classes of which I have briefly touched
upon, but I could by no effort express words in terms of those signs.
