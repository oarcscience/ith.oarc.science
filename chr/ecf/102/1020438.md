<span id="iv.XV.17-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XV.17-p1.1"></span>Chapter 17.—Of the Two Fathers and Leaders Who
Sprang from One Progenitor.</span>

<span id="iv.XV.17-p2"></span>Since, then, Adam was the father of both
lines,—the father, that is to say, both of the line which belonged to
the earthly, and of that which belonged to the heavenly city,—when Abel
was slain, and by his death exhibited a marvellous mystery, there were
henceforth two lines proceeding from two fathers, Cain and Seth, and in
those sons of theirs, whom it behoved to register, the tokens of these
two cities began to appear more distinctly.  For Cain begat Enoch, in
whose name he built a city, an earthly one, which was not from home in
this world, but rested satisfied with its temporal peace and happiness. 
Cain, too, means “possession;” wherefore at his birth either his father
or mother said,” I have gotten a man through God.”  Then Enoch means
“dedication;” for the earthly city is dedicated in this world in which
it is built, for in this world it finds the end towards which it aims
and aspires.  Further, Seth signifies “resurrection,” and Enos his son
signifies “man,” not as Adam, which also signifies man, but is used in
Hebrew indifferently for man and woman, as it is written, “Male and
female created He them, and blessed them, and called their name
Adam,” <span id="fr_820"></span>[821](#fn_820) leaving no room to doubt
that though the woman was distinctively called Eve, yet the name Adam,
meaning man, was common to both.  But Enos means man in so restricted a
sense, that Hebrew linguists tell us it cannot be applied to woman:  it
is the equivalent of the “child of the resurrection,” when they neither
marry nor are given in marriage. <span id="fr_821"></span>[822](#fn_821)
  For there shall be no generation in that place to which regeneration
shall have brought us.  Wherefore I think it not immaterial to observe
that in those generations which are propagated from him who is called
Seth, although daughters as well as sons are said to have been begotten,
no woman is expressly registered by name; but in those which sprang from
Cain at the very termination to which the line runs, the last person
named as begotten is a woman. <span id="page_299">p. 299</span> <span
id="iv.XV.17-Page_299"></span> For we read, “Methusael begat Lamech. 
And Lamech took unto him two wives:  the name of the one was Adah, and
the name of the other Zillah.  And Adah bare Jabal:  he was the father
of the shepherds that dwell in tents.  And his brother’s name was
Jubal:  he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ.  And
Zillah, she also bare Tubal-cain, an instructor of every artificer in
brass and iron:  and the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.” <span
id="fr_822"></span>[823](#fn_822)   Here terminate all the generations
of Cain, being eight in number, including Adam,—to wit, seven from Adam
to Lamech, who married two wives, and whose children, among whom a woman
also is named, form the eighth generation.  Whereby it is elegantly
signified that the earthly city shall to its termination have carnal
generations proceeding from the intercourse of males and females.  And
therefore the wives themselves of the man who is the last named father
of Cain’s line, are registered in their own names,—a practice nowhere
followed before the deluge save in Eve’s case.  Now as Cain, signifying
possession, the founder of the earthly city, and his son Enoch, meaning
dedication, in whose name it was founded, indicate that this city is
earthly both in its beginning and in its end,—a city in which nothing
more is hoped for than can be seen in this world,—so Seth, meaning
resurrection, and being the father of generations registered apart from
the others, we must consider what this sacred history says of his son.
