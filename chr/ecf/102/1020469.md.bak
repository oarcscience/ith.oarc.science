id="iv.XVI.20-p1.1"></span>Chapter 20.—Of the Parting of Lot and
Abraham, Which They Agreed to Without Breach of Charity.</span>

<span id="iv.XVI.20-p2"></span>On Abraham’s return out of Egypt to the
place he had left, Lot, his brother’s son, departed from him into the
land of Sodom, without breach of charity.  For they had grown rich, and
began to have many herdmen of cattle, and when these strove together,
they avoided in this way the pugnacious discord of their families. 
Indeed, as human affairs go, this cause might even have given rise to
some strife between themselves.  Consequently these are the words of
Abraham to Lot, when taking precaution against this evil, “Let there be
no strife between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen;
for we be brethren.  Behold, is not the whole land before thee? 
Separate thyself from me:  if thou wilt go to the left hand, I will go
to the right; or if thou wilt go to the right hand, I will go to the
left.” <span id="fr_904"></span>[905](#fn_904.md)   From this, perhaps, has
arisen a pacific custom among men, that when there is any partition of
earthly things, the greater should make the division, the less the
choice.
