<span id="iv.XXI.13-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XXI.13-p1.1"></span>Chapter 13.—Against the Opinion of Those Who
Think that the Punishments of the Wicked After Death are
Purgatorial.</span>

<span id="iv.XXI.13-p2"></span>The Platonists, indeed, while they
maintain that no sins are unpunished, suppose that all punishment is
administered for remedial purposes, <span
id="fr_1518"></span>[1519](#fn_1518) be it inflicted by human or divine
law, in this life or after death; for a man may be scathless here, or,
though punished, may yet not amend.  Hence that passage of Virgil,
where, when he had said of our earthly bodies and mortal members, that
our souls derive—

<span id="iv.XXI.13-p4"></span>“Hence wild desires and grovelling fears,

<span id="iv.XXI.13-p5"></span>And human laughter, human tears;

<span id="iv.XXI.13-p6"></span>Immured in dungeon-seeming night,

<span id="iv.XXI.13-p7"></span>They look abroad, yet see no light,”

<span id="iv.XXI.13-p8"></span>goes on to say:

<span id="iv.XXI.13-p9"></span>“Nay, when at last the life has fled,

<span id="iv.XXI.13-p10"></span>And left the body cold and dead,

<span id="iv.XXI.13-p11"></span>Ee’n then there passes not away

<span id="iv.XXI.13-p12"></span>The painful heritage of clay;

<span id="iv.XXI.13-p13"></span>Full many a long-contracted stain

<span id="iv.XXI.13-p14"></span>Perforce must linger deep in grain.

<span id="iv.XXI.13-p15"></span>So penal sufferings they endure

<span id="iv.XXI.13-p16"></span>For ancient crime, to make them pure;

<span id="iv.XXI.13-p17"></span>Some hang aloft in open view,

<span id="iv.XXI.13-p18"></span>For winds to pierce them through and
through,

<span id="iv.XXI.13-p19"></span>While others purge their guilt deep-dyed

<span id="iv.XXI.13-p20"></span>In burning fire or whelming tide.” <span
id="fr_1519"></span>[1520](#fn_1519)

<span id="iv.XXI.13-p22"></span>They who are of this opinion would have
all punishments after death to be purgatorial; and as the elements of
air, fire, and water are superior to earth, one or other of these may
<span id="page_464">p. 464</span> <span id="iv.XXI.13-Page_464"></span>
be the instrument of expiating and purging away the stain contracted by
the contagion of earth.  So Virgil hints at the air in the words, “Some
hang aloft for winds to pierce;” at the water in “whelming tide;” and at
fire in the expression “in burning fire.”  For our part, we recognize
that even in this life some punishments are purgatorial,—not, indeed, to
those whose life is none the better, but rather the worse for them, but
to those who are constrained by them to amend their life.  All other
punishments, whether temporal or eternal, inflicted as they are on every
one by divine providence, are sent either on account of past sins, or of
sins presently allowed in the life, or to exercise and reveal a man’s
graces.  They may be inflicted by the instrumentality of bad men and
angels as well as of the good.  For even if any one suffers some hurt
through another’s wickedness or mistake, the man indeed sins whose
ignorance or injustice does the harm; but God, who by His just though
hidden judgment permits it to be done, sins not.  But temporary
punishments are suffered by some in this life only, by others after
death, by others both now and then; but all of them before that last and
strictest judgment.  But of those who suffer temporary punishments after
death, all are not doomed to those everlasting pains which are to follow
that judgment; for to some, as we have already said, what is not
remitted in this world is remitted in the next, that is, they are not
punished with the eternal punishment of the world to come.

<span id="iv.XXI.13-p3"></span> Plato’s own theory was that punishment
had a twofold purpose, to reform and to deter.  “No one punishes an
offender on account of the past offense, and simply because he has done
wrong, but for the sake of the future, that the offense may not be again
committed, either by the same person or by any one who has seen him
punished.”—See the *Protagoras*, 324, b, and Grote’s *Plato*, ii. 41.
