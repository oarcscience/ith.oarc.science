<span id="iv.XXI.10-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XXI.10-p1.1"></span>Chapter 10.—Whether the Fire of Hell, If It
Be Material Fire, Can Burn the Wicked Spirits, that is to Say, Devils,
Who are Immaterial.</span>

<span id="iv.XXI.10-p2"></span>Here arises the question:  If the fire is
not to be immaterial, analogous to the pain of the soul, but material,
burning by contact, so that bodies may be tormented in it, how can evil
spirits be punished in it?  For it is undoubtedly the same fire which is
to serve for the punishment of men and of devils, according to the words
of Christ:  “Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared
for the devil and his angels;” <span
id="fr_1511"></span>[1512](#fn_1511.md) unless, perhaps, as learned men
have thought, the devils have a kind of body made of that dense and
humid air which we feel strikes us when the <span id="page_462">p.
462</span> <span id="iv.XXI.10-Page_462"></span> wind is blowing.  And
if this kind of substance could not be affected by fire, it could not
burn when heated in the baths.  For in order to burn, it is first
burned, and affects other things as itself is affected.  But if any one
maintains that the devils have no bodies, this is not a matter either to
be laboriously investigated, or to be debated with keenness.  For why
may we not assert that even immaterial spirits may, in some
extraordinary way, yet really be pained by the punishment of material
fire, if the spirits of men, which also are certainly immaterial, are
both now contained in material members of the body, and in the world to
come shall be indissolubly united to their own bodies?  Therefore,
though the devils have no bodies, yet their spirits, that is, the devils
themselves, shall be brought into thorough contact with the material
fires, to be tormented by them; not that the fires themselves with which
they are brought into contact shall be animated by their connection with
these spirits, and become animals composed of body and spirit, but, as I
said, this junction will be effected in a wonderful and ineffable way,
so that they shall receive pain from the fires, but give no life to
them.  And, in truth, this other mode of union, by which bodies and
spirits are bound together and become animals, is thoroughly marvellous,
and beyond the comprehension of man, though this it is which is man.

<span id="iv.XXI.10-p4"></span>I would indeed say that these spirits
will burn without any body of their own, as that rich man was burning in
hell when he exclaimed, “I am tormented in this flame,” <span
id="fr_1512"></span>[1513](#fn_1512.md) were I not aware that it is aptly
said in reply, that that flame was of the same nature as the eyes he
raised and fixed on Lazarus, as the tongue on which he entreated that a
little cooling water might be dropped, or as the finger of Lazarus, with
which he asked that this might be done,—all of which took place where
souls exist without bodies.  Thus, therefore, both that flame in which
he burned and that drop he begged were immaterial, and resembled the
visions of sleepers or persons in an ecstasy, to whom immaterial objects
appear in a bodily form.  For the man himself who is in such a state,
though it be in spirit only, not in body, yet sees himself so like to
his own body that he cannot discern any difference whatever.  But that
hell, which also is called a lake of fire and brimstone, <span
id="fr_1513"></span>[1514](#fn_1513.md) will be material fire, and will
torment the bodies of the damned, whether men or devils,—the solid
bodies of the one, aerial bodies of the others; or if only men have
bodies as well as souls, yet the evil spirits, though without bodies,
shall be so connected with the bodily fires as to receive pain without
imparting life.  One fire certainly shall be the lot of both, for thus
the truth has declared.
