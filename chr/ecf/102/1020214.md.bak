id="iv.VII.31-p1.1"></span>Chapter 31.—What Benefits God Gives to the
Followers of the Truth to Enjoy Over and Above His General
Bounty.</span>

<span id="iv.VII.31-p2"></span>For, besides such benefits as, according
to this administration of nature of which we have made some mention, He
lavishes on good and bad alike, we have from Him a great manifestation
of great love, which belongs only to the good.  For although we can
never sufficiently give thanks to Him, that we are, that we live, that
we behold heaven and earth, that we have mind and reason by which to
seek after Him who made all these things, nevertheless, what hearts,
what number of tongues, shall affirm that they are sufficient to render
thanks to Him for this, that He hath not wholly departed from us, laden
and overwhelmed with sins, averse to the contemplation of His light, and
blinded by the love of darkness, that is, of iniquity, but hath sent to
us His own Word, who is His only Son, that by His birth and suffering
for us in the flesh, which He assumed, we might know how much God valued
man, and that by that unique sacrifice we might be purified from all our
sins, and that, love being shed abroad in our hearts by His Spirit, we
might, having surmounted all difficulties, come into eternal rest, and
the ineffable sweetness of the contemplation of Himself?
