<span id="v.v.viii-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="v.v.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 8.—The Canonical Books.</span>

<span id="v.v.viii-p2"></span>12.  But let us now go back to consider
the third step here mentioned, for it is about it that I have set myself
to speak and reason as the Lord shall grant me wisdom.  The most
skillful interpreter of the sacred writings, then, will be he who in the
first place has read them all and retained them in his knowledge, if not
yet with full understanding, still with such knowledge as reading
gives,—those of them, at least, that are called *canonical*.  For he
will read the others with greater safety when built up in the belief of
the truth, so that they will not take first possession of a weak mind,
nor, cheating it with dangerous falsehoods and delusions, fill it with
prejudices adverse to a sound understanding.  Now, in regard to the
canonical Scriptures, he must follow the judgment of the greater number
of catholic churches; and among these, of course, a high place must be
given to such as have been thought worthy to be the seat of an apostle
and to receive epistles.  Accordingly, among the canonical Scriptures he
will judge according to the following standard:  to prefer those that
are received by all the catholic churches to those which some do not
receive.  Among those, again, which are not received by all, he will
prefer such as have the sanction of the greater number and those of
greater authority, to such as are held by the smaller number and those
of less authority.  If, however, he shall find that some books are held
by the greater number of churches, and others by the churches of greater
authority (though this is not a very likely thing to happen), I think
that in such a case the authority on the two sides is to be looked upon
as equal.

<span id="v.v.viii-p3"></span>13.  Now the whole canon of Scripture on
which we say this judgment is to be exercised, is contained in the
following books:—Five books of Moses, that is, Genesis, Exodus,
Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy; one book of Joshua the son of Nun; one
of Judges; one short book called Ruth, which seems rather to belong to
the beginning of Kings; next, <span id="page_539">p. 539</span> <span
id="v.v.viii-Page_539"></span> four books of Kings, and two of
Chronicles—these last not following one another, but running parallel,
so to speak, and going over the same ground.  The books now mentioned
are history, which contains a connected narrative of the times, and
follows the order of the events.  There are other books which seem to
follow no regular order, and are connected neither with the order of the
preceding books nor with one another, such as Job, and Tobias, and
Esther, and Judith, and the two books of Maccabees, and the two of
Ezra, <span id="fr_1769"></span>[1770](#fn_1769.md) which last look more
like a sequel to the continuous regular history which terminates with
the books of Kings and Chronicles.  Next are the Prophets, in which
there is one book of the Psalms of David; and three books of Solomon,
viz., Proverbs, Song of Songs, and Ecclesiastes.  For two books, one
called Wisdom and the other Ecclesiasticus, are ascribed to Solomon from
a certain resemblance of style, but the most likely opinion is that they
were written by Jesus the son of Sirach. <span
id="fr_1770"></span>[1771](#fn_1770.md)   Still they are to be reckoned
among the prophetical books, since they have attained recognition as
being authoritative.  The remainder are the books which are strictly
called the Prophets:  twelve separate books of the prophets which are
connected with one another, and having never been disjoined, are
reckoned as one book; the names of these prophets are as follows:—Hosea,
Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai,
Zechariah, Malachi; then there are the four greater prophets, Isaiah,
Jeremiah, Daniel, Ezekiel.  The authority of the Old Testament <span
id="fr_1771"></span>[1772](#fn_1771.md) is contained within the limits of
these forty-four books.  That of the New Testament, again, is contained
within the following:—Four books of the Gospel, according to Matthew,
according to Mark, according to Luke, according to John; fourteen
epistles of the Apostle Paul—one to the Romans, two to the Corinthians,
one to the Galatians, to the Ephesians, to the Philippians, two to the
Thessalonians, one to the Colossians, two to Timothy, one to Titus, to
Philemon, to the Hebrews:  two of Peter; three of John; one of Jude; and
one of James; one book of the Acts of the Apostles; and one of the
Revelation of John.

this opinion so far as regards the book of Wisdom.
