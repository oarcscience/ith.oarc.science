id="iv.XVIII.36-p1.1"></span>Chapter 36.—About Esdras and the Books of
the Maccabees.</span>

<span id="iv.XVIII.36-p2"></span>After these three prophets, Haggai,
Zechariah, and Malachi, during the same period of the liberation of the
people from the Babylonian servitude Esdras also wrote, who is
historical rather than prophetical, as is also the book called Esther,
which is found to relate, for the praise of God, events not far from
those times; unless, perhaps, Esdras is to be understood as prophesying
of Christ in that passage where, on a question having arisen among
certain young men as to what is the strongest thing, when one had said
kings, another wine, the third women, who for the most part rule kings,
yet that same third youth demonstrated that the truth is victorious over
all. <span id="fr_1210"></span>[1211](#fn_1210.md)   For by consulting the
Gospel we learn that Christ is the Truth.  From this time, when the
temple was rebuilt, down to the time of Aristobulus, the Jews had not
kings but princes; and the reckoning of their dates is found, not in the
Holy Scriptures which are called canonical, but in others, among which
are also the books of the Maccabees.  These are held as canonical, not
by the Jews, but by the Church, on account of the extreme and wonderful
sufferings of certain martyrs, who, before Christ had come in the flesh,
contended for the law of God even unto death, and endured most grievous
and horrible evils.
