id="iv.XI.12-p1.1"></span>Chapter 12.—A Comparison of the Blessedness of
the Righteous, Who Have Not Yet Received the Divine Reward, with that of
Our First Parents in Paradise.</span>

<span id="iv.XI.12-p2"></span>And the angels are not the only members of
the rational and intellectual creation whom we call blessed.  For who
will take upon him to deny that those first men in Paradise were blessed
previously to sin, although they were uncertain how long their
blessedness was to last, and whether it would be eternal (and eternal it
would have been had they not sinned),—who, I say, will do so, seeing
that even now we not unbecomingly call those blessed whom we see leading
a righteous and holy life, in hope of immortality, who have no harrowing
remorse of conscience, but obtain readily divine remission of the sins
of their present infirmity?  These, though they are certain that they
shall be rewarded if they persevere, are not certain that they will
persevere.  For what man can know that he will persevere to the end in
the exercise and increase of grace, unless he has been certified by some
revelation from Him who, in His just and secret judgment, while He
deceives none, informs few regarding this matter?  Accordingly, so far
as present comfort goes, the first man in Paradise was more blessed than
any just man in this insecure state; but as regards the hope of future
good, every man who not merely supposes, but certainly knows that he
shall eternally enjoy the most high God in the company of angels, and
beyond the reach of ill,—this man, no matter what bodily torments
afflict him, is more blessed than was he who, even in that great
felicity of Paradise, was uncertain of his fate. <span
