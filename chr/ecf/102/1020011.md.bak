id="iv.ii.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 5.—Cæsar’s Statement Regarding the
Universal Custom of an Enemy When Sacking a City.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.vi-p2"></span>Even Cæsar himself gives us positive
testimony regarding this custom; for, in his deliverance in the senate
about the conspirators, he says (as Sallust, a historian of
distinguished veracity, writes <span id="fr_44"></span>[45](#fn_44) .md)
“that virgins and boys are violated, children torn from the embrace of
their parents, matrons subjected to whatever should be the pleasure of
the conquerors, temples and houses plundered, slaughter and burning
rife; in fine, all things filled with arms, corpses, blood, and
wailing.”  If he had not mentioned temples here, we might suppose that
enemies were in the habit of sparing the dwellings of the gods.  And the
Roman temples were in danger of these disasters, not from foreign foes,
but from Catiline and his associates, the most noble senators and
citizens of Rome.  But these, it may be said, were abandoned men, and
the parricides of their fatherland.
