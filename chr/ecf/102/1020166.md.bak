id="iv.V.25-p1.1"></span>Chapter 25.—Concerning the Prosperity Which God
Granted to the Christian Emperor Constantine.</span>

<span id="iv.V.25-p2"></span>For the good God, lest men, who believe
that He is to be worshipped with a view to eternal life, should think
that no one could attain to all this high estate, and to this
terrestrial dominion, unless he should be a worshipper of the
demons,—supposing that these spirits have great power with respect to
such things,—for this reason He gave to the Emperor Constantine, who was
not a worshipper of demons, but of the true God Himself, such fullness
of earthly gifts as no one would even dare wish for.  To him also He
granted the honor of founding a city, <span
id="fr_226"></span>[227](#fn_226.md) a companion to the Roman empire, the
daughter, as it were, of Rome itself, but without any temple or image of
the demons.  He reigned for a long period as sole emperor, and unaided
held and defended the whole Roman world.  In conducting and carrying on
wars he was most victorious; in overthrowing tyrants he was most
successful.  He died at a great age, of sickness and old age, and left
his sons to succeed him in the empire. <span
id="fr_227"></span>[228](#fn_227.md)   But again, lest any emperor should
become a Christian in order to merit the happiness of Constantine, when
every one should be a Christian for the sake of eternal life, God took
away Jovian far sooner than Julian, and permitted that Gratian should be
slain by the sword of a tyrant.  But in his case there was far more
mitigation of the calamity than in the case of the great Pompey, for he
could not be avenged by Cato, whom he had left, as it were, heir to the
civil war.  But Gratian, though pious minds require not such
consolations, was avenged by Theodosius, whom he had associated with
himself in the empire, though he had a little brother of his own, being
more desirous of a faithful alliance than of extensive power.
