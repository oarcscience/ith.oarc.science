<span id="v.v.iv-p2"></span>5.  But because words pass away as soon as
they strike upon the air, and last no longer than their sound, men have
by means of letters formed signs of words.  Thus the sounds of the voice
are made visible to the eye, not of course as sounds, but by means of
certain signs.  It has been found impossible, however, to make those
signs common to all nations owing to the sin of discord among men, which
springs from every man trying to snatch the chief place for himself. 
And that celebrated tower which was built to reach to heaven was an
indication of this arrogance of spirit; and the ungodly men concerned in
it justly earned the punishment of having not their minds only, but
their tongues besides, thrown into confusion and discordance. <span
