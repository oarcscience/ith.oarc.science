<span id="iv.II_1.1-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.II_1.1-p1.1"></span>Chapter 1.—Of the Limits Which Must Be Put to
the Necessity of Replying to an Adversary.</span>

<span id="iv.II_1.1-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.II_1.1-p2.1"></span>If</span> the feeble mind of man did not
presume to resist the clear evidence of truth, but yielded its infirmity
to wholesome doctrines, as to a health-giving medicine, until it
obtained from God, by its faith and piety, the grace needed to heal it,
they who have just ideas, and express them in suitable language, would
need to use no long discourse to refute the errors of empty conjecture. 
But this mental infirmity is now more prevalent and hurtful than ever,
to such an extent that even after the truth has been as fully
demonstrated as man can prove it to man, they hold for the very truth
their own unreasonable fancies, either on account of their great
blindness, which prevents them from seeing what is plainly set before
them, or on account of their opinionative obstinacy, which prevents them
from acknowledging the force of what they do see.  There therefore
frequently arises a necessity of speaking more fully on those points
which are already clear, that we may, as it were, present them not to
the eye, but even to the touch, so that they may be felt even by those
who close their eyes against them.  And yet to what end shall we ever
bring our discussions, or what bounds can be set to our discourse, if we
proceed on the principle that we must always reply to those who reply to
us?  For those who are either unable to understand our arguments, or are
so hardened by the habit of contradiction, that though they understand
they cannot yield to them, reply to us, and, as it is written, “speak
hard things,” <span id="fr_85"></span>[86](#fn_85.md) and are incorrigibly
vain.  Now, if we were to propose to confute their objections as often
as they with brazen face chose to disregard our arguments, and so often
as they could by any means contradict our statements, you see how
endless, and fruitless, and painful a task we should be undertaking. 
And therefore I do not wish my writings to be judged even by you, my son
Marcellinus, nor by any of those others at whose service this work of
mine is freely and in all Christian charity put, if at least you intend
always to require a reply to every exception which you hear taken to
what you read in it; for so you would become like those silly women of
whom the apostle says that they are “always learning, and never able to
come to the knowledge of the truth.” <span
