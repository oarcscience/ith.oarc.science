id="v.iv.xl-p1.1"></span>Chapter 40.—What Manner of Reader Scripture
Demands.</span>

<span id="v.iv.xl-p2"></span>44.  And, therefore, if a man fully
understands that “the end of the commandment is charity, out of a pure
heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned,” <span
id="fr_1756"></span>[1757](#fn_1756.md) and is bent upon making all his
understanding of Scripture to bear upon these three graces, he may come
to the interpretation of these books with an easy mind.  For while the
apostle says “love,” he adds “out of a pure heart,” to provide against
anything being loved but that which is worthy of love.  And he joins
with this “a good conscience,” in reference to hope; for, if a man has
the burthen of a bad conscience, he despairs of ever reaching that which
he believes in and loves.  And in the third place he says:  “and of
faith unfeigned.”  For if our faith is free from all hypocrisy, then we
both abstain from loving what is unworthy of our love, and by living
uprightly we are able to indulge the hope that our hope shall not be in
vain.

<span id="v.iv.xl-p4"></span>For these reasons I have been anxious to
speak about the objects of faith, as far as I thought it necessary for
my present purpose; for much has already been said on this subject in
other volumes, either by others or by myself.  And so let this be the
end of the present book.  In the next I shall discuss, as far as God
shall give me light, the subject of signs.
