<span id="iv.XVI.39-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XVI.39-p1.1"></span>Chapter 39.—The Reason Why Jacob Was Also
Called Israel.</span>

<span id="iv.XVI.39-p2"></span>As I said a little ago, Jacob was also
called Israel, the name which was most prevalent among the people
descended from him.  Now this name was given him by the angel who
wrestled with him on the way back from Mesopotamia, and who was most
evidently a type of Christ.  For when Jacob overcame him, doubtless with
his own consent, that the mystery might be represented, it signified
Christ’s passion, in which the Jews are seen overcoming Him.  And yet he
besought a blessing from the very angel he had overcome; and so the
imposition of this name was the blessing.  For Israel means *seeing
God*, <span id="fr_964"></span>[965](#fn_964.md) which will at last be the
reward of all the saints.  The angel also touched him on the breadth of
the thigh when he was overcoming him, and in that way made him lame.  So
that Jacob was at one and the same time blessed and lame:  blessed in
those among that people who believed in Christ, and lame in the
unbelieving.  For the breadth of the thigh is the multitude of the
family.  For there are many of that race of whom it was prophetically
said beforehand, “And they have halted in their paths.” <span
