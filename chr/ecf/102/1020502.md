<span id="iv.XVII.9"></span>

<span id="iv.XVII.9-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XVII.9-p1.1"></span>Chapter 9.—How Like the Prophecy About Christ
in the 89th Psalm is to the Things Promised in Nathan’s Prophecy in the
Books of Samuel.</span>

<span id="iv.XVII.9-p2"></span>Wherefore also in the 89th Psalm, of
which the title is, “An instruction for himself by Ethan the Israelite,”
mention is made of the promises God made to king David, and some things
are there added similar to those found in the Book of Samuel, such as
this, “I have sworn to David my servant that I will prepare his seed for
ever.” <span id="fr_1045"></span>[1046](#fn_1045.md)   And again, “Then
thou spakest in vision to thy sons, and saidst, I have laid help upon
the mighty One, and have exalted the chosen One out of my people.  I
have found David my servant, and with my holy oil I have anointed him. 
For mine hand shall help him, and mine arm shall strengthen him.  The
enemy shall not prevail against him, and the son of iniquity shall harm
him no more.  And I will beat down his foes from before his face, and
those that hate him will I put to flight.  And my truth and my mercy
shall be with him, and in my name shall his horn be exalted.  I will set
his hand also in the sea, and his right hand in the rivers.  He shall
cry unto me, Thou art my Father, my God, and the undertaker of my
salvation.  Also I will make him my first-born, high among the kings of
the earth.  My mercy will I keep for him for evermore, and my covenant
shall be faithful (sure) with him.  His seed also will I set for ever
and ever, and his throne as the days of heaven.” <span
id="fr_1046"></span>[1047](#fn_1046.md)   Which words, when rightly
understood, are all understood to be about the Lord Jesus Christ, under
the name of David, on account of the form of a servant, which the same
Mediator assumed <span id="fr_1047"></span>[1048](#fn_1047.md) from the
virgin of the seed of David. <span id="fr_1048"></span>[1049](#fn_1048.md)
  For immediately something is said about the sins of his children, such
as is set down in the Book of Samuel, and is more readily taken as if of
Solomon.  For there, that is, in the Book of Samuel, he says, “And if he
commit iniquity I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the
stripes of the sons of men; but my mercy will I not take away from
him,” <span id="fr_1049"></span>[1050](#fn_1049.md) meaning by stripes the
strokes of correction.  Hence that saying, “Touch ye not my
christs.” <span id="fr_1050"></span>[1051](#fn_1050.md)   For what else is
that than, Do not harm them?  But in the psalm, when speaking as if of
David, He says something of the same kind there too.  “If his children,”
saith He, “forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments; if they profane
my righteousnesses, and keep not my commandments; I will visit their
iniquities with the rod, and their faults with stripes:  but my mercy I
will not make void from him.” <span id="fr_1051"></span>[1052](#fn_1051.md)
  He did not say “from them,” although He spoke of his children, not of
himself; but he said “from him,” which means the same thing if rightly
understood.  For of Christ Himself, who is the head of the Church, there
could not be found any sins which required to be divinely restrained by
human correction, mercy being still continued; but they are found in His
body and members, which is His people.  Therefore in the Book of Samuel
it is said, “iniquity of Him,” but in the psalm, “of His children,” that
we may understand that what is said of His body is in some way said of
Himself.  Wherefore also, when Saul persecuted His body, that is, His
believing people, He Himself saith from heaven, “Saul, Saul, why
persecutest thou me?” <span id="fr_1052"></span>[1053](#fn_1052.md)   Then
in the following words of the psalm He says, “Neither will I hurt in my
truth, nor profane my covenant, and the things that proceed from my lips
I will not disallow.  Once have I sworn by my holiness, if I lie unto
David,” <span id="fr_1053"></span>[1054](#fn_1053.md) —that is, I will in
no wise lie unto <span id="page_350">p. 350</span> <span
id="iv.XVII.9-Page_350"></span> David; for Scripture is wont to speak
thus.  But what that is in which He will not lie, He adds, saying, “His
seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before me, and as
the moon perfected for ever, and a faithful witness in heaven.” <span
id="fr_1054"></span>[1055](#fn_1054.md)
