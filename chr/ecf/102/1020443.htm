<p class="c34"><a name="iv.XV.22-p1"></A><span class="c2"><a name="iv.XV.22-p1.1"></A>Chapter 22.&#8212;Of the Fall of the Sons of God Who Were Captivated by the Daughters of Men, Whereby All, with the Exception of Eight Persons, Deservedly Perished in the Deluge.</span></p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="iv.XV.22-p2"></A>When the human race, in the exercise of this freedom of will, increased and advanced, there arose a mixture and confusion of the  <A NAME="page_303"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 303</FONT></A> <a name="iv.XV.22-Page_303"></A>  two cities by their participation in a common iniquity.&#160; And this calamity, as well as the first, was occasioned by woman, though not in the same way; for these women were not themselves betrayed, neither did they persuade the men to sin, but having belonged to the earthly city and society of the earthly, they had been of corrupt manners from the first, and were loved for their bodily beauty by the sons of God, or the citizens of the other city which sojourns in this world.&#160; Beauty is indeed a good gift of God; but that the good may not think it a great good, God dispenses it even to the wicked.&#160; And thus, when the good that is great and proper to the good was abandoned by the sons of God, they fell to a paltry good which is not peculiar to the good, but common to the good and the evil; and when they were captivated by the daughters of men, they adopted the manners of the earthly to win them as their brides, and forsook the godly ways they had followed in their own holy society.&#160; And thus beauty, which is indeed God&#146;s handiwork, but only a temporal, carnal, and lower kind of good, is not fitly loved in preference to God, the eternal, spiritual, and unchangeable good.&#160; When the miser prefers his gold to justice, it is through no fault of the gold, but of the man; and so with every created thing.&#160; For though it be good, it may be loved with an evil as well as with a good love:&#160; it is loved rightly when it is loved ordinately; evilly, when inordinately.&#160; It is this which some one has briefly said in these verses in praise of the Creator:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_839"></A><A HREF="#fn_839"><FONT SIZE="1">840</FONT></A>
&#160; &#8220;These are Thine, they are good, because Thou art good who didst create them.&#160; There is in them nothing of ours, unless the sin we commit when we forget the order of things, and instead of Thee love that which Thou hast made.&#8221;</p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="iv.XV.22-p4"></A>But if the Creator is truly loved, that is, if He Himself is loved and not another thing in His stead, He cannot be evilly loved; for love itself is to be ordinately loved, because we do well to love that which, when we love it, makes us live well and virtuously.&#160; So that it seems to me that it is a brief but true definition of virtue to say, it is the order of love; and on this account, in the Canticles, the bride of Christ, the city of God, sings, &#8220;Order love within me.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_840"></A><A HREF="#fn_840"><FONT SIZE="1">841</FONT></A>
&#160; It was the order of this love, then, this charity or attachment, which the sons of God disturbed when they forsook God, and were enamored of the daughters of men.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_841"></A><A HREF="#fn_841"><FONT SIZE="1">842</FONT></A>
&#160; And by these two names (sons of God and daughters of men) the two cities are sufficiently distinguished.&#160; For though the former were by nature children of men, they had come into possession of another name by grace.&#160; For in the same Scripture in which the sons of God are said to have loved the daughters of men, they are also called angels of God; whence many suppose that they were not men but angels.</p>
