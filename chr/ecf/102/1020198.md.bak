id="iv.VII.15-p1.1"></span>Chapter 15.—Concerning Certain Stars Which
the Pagans Have Called by the Names of Their Gods.</span>

<span id="iv.VII.15-p2"></span>But possibly these stars which have been
called by their names are these gods.  For they call a certain star
Mercury, and likewise a certain other star Mars.  But among those stars
which are called by the names of gods, is that one which they call
Jupiter, and yet with them Jupiter is the world.  There also is that one
they call Saturn, and yet they give to him no small property
besides,—namely, all seeds.  There also is that brightest of them all
which is called by them Venus, and yet they will have this same Venus to
be also the moon:—not to mention how Venus and Juno are said by them to
contend about that most brilliant star, as though about another golden
apple.  For some say that Lucifer belongs to Venus, and some to Juno. 
But, as usual, Venus conquers.  For by far the greatest number assign
that star to Venus, so much so that there is scarcely found one of them
who thinks otherwise.  But since they call Jupiter the king of all, who
will not laugh to see his star so far surpassed in brilliancy by the
star of Venus?  For it ought to have been as much more brilliant than
the rest, as he himself is more powerful.  They answer that it only
appears so because it is higher up, and very much farther away from the
earth.  If, therefore, its greater dignity has deserved a higher place,
why is Saturn higher in the heavens than Jupiter?  Was the vanity of the
fable which made Jupiter king not able to reach the stars?  And has
Saturn been permitted to obtain at least in the heavens, what he could
not obtain in his own kingdom nor in the Capitol?

<span id="iv.VII.15-p3"></span>But why has Janus received no star?  If
it is because he is the world, and they are all in him, the world is
also Jupiter’s, and yet he has one.  Did Janus compromise his case as
best he could, and instead of the one star which he does not have among
the heavenly bodies, accept so many faces on earth?  Again, if they
think that on account of the stars alone Mercury and Mars are parts of
the world, in order that they may be able to have them for gods, since
speech and war are not parts of the world, but acts of men, how is it
that they have made no altars, established no rites, built no temples
for Aries, and Taurus, and Cancer, and Scorpio, and the rest which they
number as the celestial signs, and which consist not of single stars,
but each of them of many stars, which also they say are situated above
those already mentioned in the highest part of the heavens, where a more
constant motion causes the stars to follow an undeviating course?  And
why have they not reckoned them as gods, I do not say among those select
gods, but not even among those, as it were, plebeian gods?
