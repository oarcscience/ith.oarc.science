id="v.iv.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter 10.—To See God, the Soul Must Be
Purified.</span>

<span id="v.iv.x-p2"></span>10.  Wherefore, since it is our duty fully
to enjoy the truth which lives unchangeably, and since the triune God
takes counsel in this truth for the things which He has made, the soul
must be purified that it may have power to perceive that light, and to
rest in it when it is perceived.  And let us look upon this purification
as a kind of journey or voyage to our native land.  For it is not by
change of place that we can come nearer to Him who is in every place,
but by the cultivation of pure desires and virtuous habits.
