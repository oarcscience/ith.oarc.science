<span id="iv.XX.28-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XX.28-p1.1"></span>Chapter 28.—That the Law of Moses Must Be
Spiritually Understood to Preclude the Damnable Murmurs of a Carnal
Interpretation.</span>

<span id="iv.XX.28-p2"></span>In the succeeding words, “Remember the law
of Moses my servant, which I commanded to him in Horeb for all
Israel,” <span id="fr_1467"></span>[1468](#fn_1467.md) the prophet
opportunely mentions precepts and statutes, after declaring the
important distinction hereafter to be made between those who observe and
those who despise the law.  He intends also that they learn to interpret
the law spiritually, and find Christ in it, by whose judgment that
separation between the good and the bad is to be made.  For it is not
without reason that the Lord Himself says to the Jews, “Had ye believed
Moses, ye would have believed me; for he wrote of me.” <span
id="fr_1468"></span>[1469](#fn_1468.md)   For by receiving the law carnally
without perceiving that its earthly promises were figures of things
spiritual, they fell into such murmur <span id="page_448">p. 448</span>
<span id="iv.XX.28-Page_448"></span> ings as audaciously to say, “It is
vain to serve God; and what profit is it that we have kept His
ordinance, and that we have walked suppliantly before the face of the
Lord Almighty?  And now we call aliens happy; yea, they that work
wickedness are set up.” <span id="fr_1469"></span>[1470](#fn_1469.md)   It
was these words of theirs which in a manner compelled the prophet to
announce the last judgment, in which the wicked shall not even in
appearance be happy, but shall manifestly be most miserable; and in
which the good shall be oppressed with not even a transitory
wretchedness, but shall enjoy unsullied and eternal felicity.  For he
had previously cited some similar expressions of those who said, “Every
one that doeth evil is good in the sight of the Lord, and such are
pleasing to Him.” <span id="fr_1470"></span>[1471](#fn_1470.md)   It was, I
say, by understanding the law of Moses carnally that they had come to
murmur thus against God.  And hence, too, the writer of the 73d Psalm
says that his feet were almost gone, his steps had well-nigh slipped,
because he was envious of sinners while he considered their prosperity,
so that he said among other things, How doth God know, and is there
knowledge in the Most High? and again, Have I sanctified my heart in
vain, and washed my hands in innocency? <span
id="fr_1471"></span>[1472](#fn_1471.md)   He goes on to say that his
efforts to solve this most difficult problem, which arises when the good
seem to be wretched and the wicked happy, were in vain until he went
into the sanctuary of God, and understood the last things. <span
id="fr_1472"></span>[1473](#fn_1472.md)   For in the last judgment things
shall not be so; but in the manifest felicity of the righteous and
manifest misery of the wicked quite another state of things shall
appear.
