<span id="iv.II_1.7"></span>

<span id="iv.II_1.7-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.II_1.7-p1.1"></span>Chapter 7.—That the Suggestions of
Philosophers are Precluded from Having Any Moral Effect, Because They
Have Not the Authority Which Belongs to Divine Instruction, and Because
Man’s Natural Bias to Evil Induces Him Rather to Follow the Examples of
the Gods Than to Obey the Precepts of Men.</span>

<span id="iv.II_1.7-p2"></span>But will they perhaps remind us of the
schools of the philosophers, and their disputations?  In the first
place, these belong not to Rome, but to Greece; and even if we yield to
them that they are now Roman, because Greece itself has become a Roman
province, still the teachings of the philosophers are not the
commandments of the gods, but the discoveries of men, who, at the
prompting of their own speculative ability, made efforts to discover the
hidden laws of nature, and the right and wrong in ethics, and in
dialectic what was consequent according to the rules of logic, and what
was inconsequent and erroneous.  And some of them, by God’s help, made
great discoveries; but when left to themselves they were betrayed by
human infirmity, and fell into mistakes.  And this was ordered by divine
providence, that their pride might be restrained, and that by their
example it might be pointed out that it is humility which has access to
the highest regions.  But of this we shall have more to say, if the Lord
God of truth permit, in its own place. <span
id="fr_96"></span>[97](#fn_96.md)   However, if the philosophers have made
any discoveries which are sufficient to guide men to virtue and
blessedness, would it not have been greater justice to vote divine
honors to them?  Were it not more accordant with every virtuous
sentiment to read Plato’s writings in a “Temple of Plato,” than to be
present in the temples of devils to witness the priests of Cybele <span
id="fr_97"></span>[98](#fn_97.md) mutilating themselves, the effeminate
being consecrated, the raving fanatics cutting themselves, and whatever
other cruel or shameful, or shamefully cruel or cruelly shameful,
ceremony is enjoined by the ritual of such gods as these?  Were it not a
more <span id="page_27">p. 27</span> <span
id="iv.II_1.7-Page_27"></span> suitable education, and more likely to
prompt the youth to virtue, if they heard public recitals of the laws of
the gods, instead of the vain laudation of the customs and laws of their
ancestors?  Certainly all the worshippers of the Roman gods, when once
they are possessed by what Persius calls “the burning poison of
lust,” <span id="fr_98"></span>[99](#fn_98.md) prefer to witness the deeds
of Jupiter rather than to hear what Plato taught or Cato censured. 
Hence the young profligate in Terence, when he sees on the wall a fresco
representing the fabled descent of Jupiter into the lap of Danaë in the
form of a golden shower, accepts this as authoritative precedent for his
own licentiousness, and boasts that he is an imitator of God.  “And what
God?” he says.  “He who with His thunder shakes the loftiest temples. 
And was I, a poor creature compared to Him, to make bones of it?  No; I
did it, and with all my heart.” <span id="fr_99"></span>[100](#fn_99.md)

<span id="iv.II_1.7-p4"></span>   “Galli,” the castrated priests of
Cybele, who were named after the river Gallus, in Phrygia, the water of
which was supposed to intoxicate or madden those who drank it. 
According to Vitruvius (viii. 3), there was a similar fountain in
Paphlagonia.  Apuleius (*Golden Ass*, viii.) gives a graphic and
humorous description of the dress, dancing and imposture of these
priests; mentioning, among other things, that they lashed themselves
with whips and cut themselves with knives till the ground was wet with
blood.

<span id="iv.II_1.7-p6"></span> Ter. *Eun*. iii. 5. 36; and cf. the
similar allusion in Aristoph. *Clouds*, 1033–4.  It may be added that
the argument of this chapter was largely used by the wiser of the
heathen themselves.  Dionysius Hal. (ii. 20) and Seneca (*De Brev Vit.*
c. xvi.) make the very same complaint; and it will be remembered that
his adoption of this reasoning was one of the grounds on which Euripides
was suspected of atheism.
