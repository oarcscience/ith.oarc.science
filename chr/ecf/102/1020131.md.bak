<span id="iv.IV.26-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.IV.26-p1.1"></span>Chapter 26.—Of the Scenic Plays, the
Celebration of Which the Gods Have Exacted from Their
Worshippers.</span>

<span id="iv.IV.26-p2"></span>“But,” says Cicero, “Homer invented these
things, and transferred things human <span id="page_78">p. 78</span>
<span id="iv.IV.26-Page_78"></span> to the gods:  I would rather
transfer things divine to us.” <span id="fr_176"></span>[177](#fn_176.md)  
The poet, by ascribing such crimes to the gods, has justly displeased
the grave man.  Why, then, are the scenic plays, where these crimes are
habitually spoken of, acted, exhibited, in honor of the gods, reckoned
among things divine by the most learned men?  Cicero should exclaim, not
against the inventions of the poets, but against the customs of the
ancients.  Would not they have exclaimed in reply, What have we done? 
The gods themselves have loudly demanded that these plays should be
exhibited in their honor, have fiercely exacted them, have menaced
destruction unless this was performed, have avenged its neglect with
great severity, and have manifested pleasure at the reparation of such
neglect.  Among their virtuous and wonderful deeds the following is
related.  It was announced in a dream to Titus Latinius, a Roman rustic,
that he should go to the senate and tell them to recommence the games of
Rome, because on the first day of their celebration a condemned criminal
had been led to punishment in sight of the people, an incident so sad as
to disturb the gods who were seeking amusement from the games.  And when
the peasant who had received this intimation was afraid on the following
day to deliver it to the senate, it was renewed next night in a severer
form:  he lost his son, because of his neglect.  On the third night he
was warned that a yet graver punishment was impending, if he should
still refuse obedience.  When even thus he did not dare to obey, he fell
into a virulent and horrible disease.  But then, on the advice of his
friends, he gave information to the magistrates, and was carried in a
litter into the senate, and having, on declaring his dream, immediately
recovered strength, went away on his own feet whole. <span
id="fr_177"></span>[178](#fn_177.md)   The senate, amazed at so great a
miracle, decreed that the games should be renewed at fourfold cost. 
What sensible man does not see that men, being put upon by malignant
demons, from whose domination nothing save the grace of God through
Jesus Christ our Lord sets free, have been compelled by force to exhibit
to such gods as these, plays which, if well advised, they should condemn
as shameful?  Certain it is that in these plays the poetic crimes of the
gods are celebrated, yet they are plays which were re-established by
decree of the senate, under compulsion of the gods.  In these plays the
most shameless actors celebrated Jupiter as the corrupter of chastity,
and thus gave him pleasure.  If that was a fiction, he would have been
moved to anger; but if he was delighted with the representation of his
crimes, even although fabulous, then, when he happened to be worshipped,
who but the devil could be served?  Is it so that he could found,
extend, and preserve the Roman empire, who was more vile than any Roman
man whatever, to whom such things were displeasing?  Could he give
felicity who was so infelicitously worshipped, and who, unless he should
be thus worshipped, was yet more infelicitously provoked to anger?
