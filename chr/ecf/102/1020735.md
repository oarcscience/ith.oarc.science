<span id="v.iv.xxxix-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="v.iv.xxxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 39.—He Who is Mature in Faith, Hope
and Love, Needs Scripture No Longer.</span>

<span id="v.iv.xxxix-p2"></span>43.  And thus a man who is resting upon
faith, hope and love, and who keeps a firm hold upon these, does not
need the Scriptures except for the purpose of instructing others. 
Accordingly, many live without copies of the Scriptures, even in
solitude, on the strength of these three graces.  So that in their case,
I think, the saying is already fulfilled:  “Whether there be prophecies,
they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether
there be knowledge, it shall vanish away.” <span
id="fr_1754"></span>[1755](#fn_1754.md)   Yet by means of these instruments
(as they may be called), so great an edifice of faith and love has been
built up in them, that, holding to what is perfect, they do not seek for
what is only in part perfect—of course, I mean, so far as is possible in
this life; for, in comparison with the future life, the life of no just
and holy man is perfect here.  Therefore the apostle says:  “Now abideth
faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is
charity:” <span id="fr_1755"></span>[1756](#fn_1755.md)   because, when a
man shall have reached the eternal world, while the other two graces
will fail, love will remain greater and more assured.
