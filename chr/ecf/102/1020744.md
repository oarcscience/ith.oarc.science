<span id="v.v.vii-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="v.v.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 7.—Steps to Wisdom:  First, Fear;
Second, Piety; Third, Knowledge; Fourth, Resolution; Fifth, Counsel;
Sixth, Purification of Heart; Seventh, Stop or Termination,
Wisdom.</span>

<span id="v.v.vii-p2"></span>9.  First of all, then, it is necessary
that we should be led by the *fear of God* to seek the knowledge of His
will, what He commands us to desire and what to avoid.  Now this fear
will of necessity excite in us the thought of our mortality and of the
death that is before us, and crucify all the motions of pride as if our
flesh were nailed to the tree.  Next it is necessary to have our hearts
subdued by *piety*, and not to run in the face of Holy Scripture,
whether when understood it strikes at some of our sins, or, when not
understood, we feel as if we could be wiser and give better commands
ourselves.  We must rather think and believe that whatever is there
written, even though it be hidden, is better and truer than anything we
could devise by our own wisdom.

<span id="v.v.vii-p3"></span>10.  After these two steps of fear and
piety, we come to the third step, *knowledge*, of which I have now
undertaken to treat.  For in this every earnest student of the Holy
Scriptures exercises himself, to find nothing else in them but that God
is to be loved for His own sake, and our neighbor for God’s sake; and
that God is to be loved with all the heart, and with all the soul, and
with all the mind, and one’s neighbor as one’s self—that is, in such a
way that all our love for our neighbor, like <span id="page_538">p.
538</span> <span id="v.v.vii-Page_538"></span> all our love for
ourselves, should have reference to God. <span
id="fr_1762"></span>[1763](#fn_1762.md)  And on these two commandments I
touched in the previous book when I was treating about things. <span
id="fr_1763"></span>[1764](#fn_1763.md)   It is necessary, then, that each
man should first of all find in the Scriptures that he, through being
entangled in the love of this world—*i.e*., of temporal things—has been
drawn far away from such a love for God and such a love for his neighbor
as Scripture enjoins.  Then that fear which leads him to think of the
judgment of God, and that piety which gives him no option but to believe
in and submit to the authority of Scripture, compel him to bewail his
condition.  For the knowledge of a good hope makes a man not boastful,
but sorrowful.  And in this frame of mind he implores with unremitting
prayers the comfort of the Divine help that he may not be overwhelmed in
despair, and so he gradually comes to the fourth step,—that is,
*strength* and *resolution*, <span id="fr_1764"></span>[1765](#fn_1764.md)
—in which he hungers and thirsts after righteousness.  For in this frame
of mind he extricates himself from every form of fatal joy in transitory
things, and turning away from these, fixes his affection on things
eternal, to wit, the unchangeable Trinity in unity.

<span id="v.v.vii-p7"></span>11.  And when, to the extent of his power,
he has gazed upon this object shining from afar, and has felt that owing
to the weakness of his sight he cannot endure that matchless light, then
in the fifth step—that is, in the *counsel of compassion* <span
id="fr_1765"></span>[1766](#fn_1765.md) —he cleanses his soul, which is
violently agitated, and disturbs him with base desires, from the filth
it has contracted.  And at this stage he exercises himself diligently in
the love of his neighbor; and when he has reached the point of loving
his enemy, full of hopes and unbroken in strength, he mounts to the
sixth step, in which he *purifies the eye itself which can see
God*, <span id="fr_1766"></span>[1767](#fn_1766.md) so far as God can be
seen by those who as far as possible die to this world.  For men see Him
just so far as they die to this world; and so far as they live to it
they see Him not.  But yet, although that light may begin to appear
clearer, and not only more tolerable, but even more delightful, still it
is only through a glass darkly that we are said to see, because we walk
by faith, not by sight, while we continue to wander as strangers in this
world, even though our conversation be in heaven. <span
id="fr_1767"></span>[1768](#fn_1767.md)   And at this stage, too, a man so
purges the eye of his affections as not to place his neighbor before, or
even in comparison with, the truth, and therefore not himself, because
not him whom he loves as himself.  Accordingly, that holy man will be so
single and so pure in heart, that he will not step aside from the truth,
either for the sake of pleasing men or with a view to avoid any of the
annoyances which beset this life.  Such a son ascends to *wisdom*, which
is the seventh and last step, and which he enjoys in peace and
tranquillity.  For the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom. <span
id="fr_1768"></span>[1769](#fn_1768.md)   From that beginning, then, till
we reach wisdom itself, our way is by the steps now described.
