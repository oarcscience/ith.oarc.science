id="iv.II_1.27-p1.1"></span>Chapter 27.—That the Obscenities of Those
Plays Which the Romans Consecrated in Order to Propitiate Their Gods,
Contributed Largely to the Overthrow of Public Order.</span>

<span id="iv.II_1.27-p2"></span>Cicero, a weighty man, and a philosopher
in his way, when about to be made edile, wished the citizens to
understand <span id="fr_115"></span>[116](#fn_115) that, among the other
duties of his magistracy, he must propitiate Flora by the celebration of
games.  And these games are reckoned devout in proportion to their
lewdness.  In another place, <span id="fr_116"></span>[117](#fn_116) and
when he was now consul, and the state in great peril, he says that games
had been celebrated for ten days together, and that nothing had been
omitted which could pacify the gods:  as if it had not been more
satisfactory to irritate the gods by temperance, than to pacify them by
debauchery; and to provoke their hate by honest living, than soothe it
by such unseemly grossness.  For no matter how cruel was the ferocity of
those men who were threatening the state, and on whose account the gods
were being propitiated, it could not have been more hurtful than the
alliance of gods who were won with the foulest vices.  To avert the
danger which threatened men’s bodies, the gods were conciliated in a
fashion that drove virtue from their spirits; and the gods did not enrol
themselves as defenders of the battlements against the besiegers, until
they had first stormed and sacked the morality of the citizens.  This
propitiation of such divinities,—a propitiation so wanton, so impure, so
immodest, so wicked, so filthy, whose actors the innate and praiseworthy
virtue of the Romans disabled from civic honors, erased from their
tribe, recognized as polluted and made infamous;—this propitiation, I
say, so foul, so detestable, and alien from every religious feeling,
these fabulous and ensnaring accounts of the criminal actions of the
gods, these scandalous actions which they either shamefully and wickedly
committed, or more shamefully and wickedly feigned, all this the whole
city learned in public both by the words and gestures of the actors. 
They saw that the gods delighted in the commission of these things, and
therefore believed that they wished them not only to be exhibited to
them, but to be imitated by themselves.  But as for that good and honest
instruction which they speak of, it was given in such secrecy, and to so
few (if indeed given at all), that they seemed rather to fear it might
be divulged, than that it might not be practised.
