id="v.IV_1.9-p1.1"></span>Chapter 9.—How, and with Whom, Difficult
Passages are to Be Discussed.</span>

<span id="v.IV_1.9-p2"></span>23.  For there are some passages which are
not understood in their proper force, or are understood with great
difficulty, at whatever length, however clearly, or with whatever
eloquence the speaker may expound them; and these should never be
brought before the people at all, or only on rare occasions when there
is some urgent reason.  In books, however, which are written in such a
style that, if understood, they, so to speak, draw their own readers,
and if not understood, give no trouble to those who do not care to read
them and in private conversations, we must not shrink from the duty of
bringing the truth which we ourselves have reached within the
comprehension of others, however difficult it may be to understand it,
and whatever labor in the way of argument it may cost us.  Only two
conditions are to be insisted upon, that our hearer <span
id="page_582">p. 582</span> <span id="v.IV_1.9-Page_582"></span> or
companion should have an earnest desire to learn the truth, and should
have capacity of mind to receive it in whatever form it may be
communicated, the teacher not being so anxious about the eloquence as
about the clearness of his teaching.
