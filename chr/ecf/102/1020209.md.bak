<span id="iv.VII.26-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.VII.26-p1.1"></span>Chapter 26.—Concerning the Abomination of the
Sacred Rites of the Great Mother.</span>

<span id="iv.VII.26-p2"></span>Concerning the effeminates consecrated to
the same Great Mother, in defiance of all the modesty which belongs to
men and women, Varro has not wished to say anything, nor do I remember
to have read anywhere aught concerning them.  These effeminates, no
later than yesterday, were going through the streets and places of
Carthage with anointed hair, whitened faces, relaxed bodies, and
feminine gait, exacting from the people the means of maintaining their
ignominious lives.  Nothing has been said concerning them. 
Interpretation failed, reason blushed, speech was silent.  The Great
Mother has surpassed all her sons, not in greatness of deity, but of
crime.  To this monster not even the monstrosity of Janus is to be
compared.  His deformity was only in his image; hers was the deformity
of cruelty in her sacred rites.  He has a redundancy of members in stone
images; she inflicts the loss of members on men.  This abomination is
not surpassed by the licentious deeds of Jupiter, so many and so great. 
He, with all his seductions of women, only disgraced heaven with one
Ganymede; she, with so many avowed and public effeminates, has both
defiled the earth and outraged heaven.  Perhaps we may either compare
Saturn to this Magna Mater, or even set him before her in this kind of
abominable cruelty, for he mutilated his father.  But at the festivals
of Saturn, men could rather be slain by the hands of others than
mutilated by their own.  He devoured his sons, as the poets say, and the
natural theologists interpret this as they list.  History says he slew
them.  But the Romans never received, like the Carthaginians, the custom
of sacrificing their sons to him.  This Great Mother of the gods,
however, has brought mutilated men into Roman temples, and has preserved
that cruel custom, being believed to promote the strength of the Romans
by emasculating their men.  Compared with this evil, what are the thefts
of Mercury, the wantonness of Venus, and the base and flagitious deeds
of the rest of them, which we might bring forward from books, were it
not that they are daily sung and danced in the theatres?  But what are
these things to so great an evil,—an evil whose magnitude was only
proportioned to the <span id="page_138">p. 138</span> <span
id="iv.VII.26-Page_138"></span> greatness of the Great
Mother,—especially as these are said to have been invented by the poets?
as if the poets had also invented this that they are acceptable to the
gods.  Let it be imputed, then, to the audacity and impudence of the
poets that these things have been sung and written of.  But that they
have been incorporated into the body of divine rites and honors, the
deities themselves demanding and extorting that incorporation, what is
that but the crime of the gods? nay more, the confession of demons and
the deception of wretched men?  But as to this that the Great Mother is
considered to be worshipped in the appropriate form when she is
worshipped by the consecration of mutilated men, this is not an
invention of the poets, nay, they have rather shrunk from it with horror
than sung of it.  Ought any one, then, to be consecrated to these select
gods, that he may live blessedly after death, consecrated to whom he
could not live decently before death, being subjected to such foul
superstitions, and bound over to unclean demons?  But all these things,
says Varro, are to be referred to the world. <span
id="fr_286"></span>[287](#fn_286.md)   Let him consider if it be not rather
to the unclean. <span id="fr_287"></span>[288](#fn_287.md)   But why not
refer that to the world which is demonstrated to be in the world?  We,
however, seek for a mind which, trusting to true religion, does not
adore the world as its god, but for the sake of God praises the world as
a work of God, and, purified from mundane defilements, comes pure <span
id="fr_288"></span>[289](#fn_288.md) to God Himself who founded the
world. <span id="fr_289"></span>[290](#fn_289.md)
