<span id="iv.III.15-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.III.15-p1.1"></span>Chapter 15.—What Manner of Life and Death the
Roman Kings Had.</span>

<span id="iv.III.15-p2"></span>And what was the end of the kings
themselves?  Of Romulus, a flattering legend tells us that he was
assumed into heaven.  But certain Roman historians relate that he was
torn in pieces by the senate for his ferocity, and that a man, Julius
Proculus, was suborned to give out that Romulus had appeared to him, and
through him commanded the Roman people to worship him as a god; and that
in this way the people, who were beginning to resent the action of the
senate, were quieted and pacified.  For an eclipse of the sun had also
happened; and this was attributed to the divine power of Romulus by the
ignorant multitude, who did not know that it was brought about by the
fixed laws of the sun’s course:  though this grief of the sun might
rather have been considered proof that Romulus had been slain, and that
the crime was indicated by this deprivation of the sun’s light; as, in
truth, was the case when the Lord was crucified through the cruelty and
impiety of the Jews.  For it is sufficiently demonstrated that this
latter obscuration of the sun did not occur by the natural laws of the
heavenly bodies, because it was then the Jewish Passover, which is held
only at full moon, whereas natural eclipses of the sun happen only at
the last quarter of the moon.  Cicero, too, shows plainly enough that
the apotheosis of Romulus was imaginary rather than real, when, even
while he is praising him in one of Scipio’s remarks in the *De
Republica*, he says:  “Such a reputation had he acquired, that when he
suddenly disappeared during an eclipse of the sun, he was supposed to
have been assumed into the number of the gods, which could be supposed
of no mortal who had not the highest reputation for virtue.” <span
id="fr_146"></span>[147](#fn_146.md)   By these words, “he suddenly
disappeared,” we are to understand that he was mysteriously made away
with by the violence either of the tempest or of a murderous assault. 
For their other writers speak not only of an eclipse, but of a sudden
storm also, which certainly either afforded opportunity for the crime,
or itself made an end of Romulus.  And of Tullus Hostilius, who was the
third king of Rome, and who was himself destroyed by lightning, Cicero
in the same book says, that “he was not supposed to have been deified by
this death, possibly because the Romans were unwilling to vulgarize the
promotion they were assured or persuaded of in the case of Romulus, lest
they should bring it into contempt by gratuitously assigning it to all
and sundry.”  In one of his invectives, <span
id="fr_147"></span>[148](#fn_147.md) too, he says, in round terms, “The
founder of this city, Romulus, we have raised to immortality and
divinity by kindly celebrating his services;” implying that his
deification was not real, but reputed, and called so by courtesy on
account of his virtues.  In the dialogue *Hortensius,* too, while
speaking of the regular eclipses of the sun, he says that they “produce
the same darkness as covered the death of Romulus, which happened during
an eclipse of the sun.”  Here you see he does not at all shrink from
speaking of his “death,” for Cicero was more of a reasoner than an
eulogist.

<span id="iv.III.15-p5"></span>The other kings of Rome, too, with the
exception of Numa Pompilius and Ancus Marcius, who died natural deaths,
what horrible ends they had!  Tullus Hostilius, the conqueror and
destroyer of Alba, was, as I said, himself and all his house consumed by
lightning.  Priscus Tarquinius was slain by his predecessor’s sons. 
Servius Tullius was foully murdered by his son-in-law Tarquinius
Superbus, who succeeded him on the throne.  Nor did so flagrant a
parricide committed against Rome’s best king drive from their altars and
shrines those gods who were said to have been moved by Paris’ adultery
to treat poor Troy in this style, and abandon it to the fire and sword
of the Greeks.  Nay, the very Tarquin who had murdered, was allowed to
succeed his father-in-law.  And this infamous parricide, during the
reign he had secured by murder, was allowed to triumph in many
victorious wars, and to build the Capitol from their spoils; the gods
meanwhile not departing, but <span id="page_52">p. 52</span> <span
id="iv.III.15-Page_52"></span> abiding, and abetting, and suffering
their king Jupiter to preside and reign over them in that very splendid
Capitol, the work of a parricide.  For he did not build the Capitol in
the days of his innocence, and then suffer banishment for subsequent
crimes; but to that reign during which he built the Capitol, he won his
way by unnatural crime.  And when he was afterwards banished by the
Romans, and forbidden the city, it was not for his own but his son’s
wickedness in the affair of Lucretia,—a crime perpetrated not only
without his cognizance, but in his absence.  For at that time he was
besieging Ardea, and fighting Rome’s battles; and we cannot say what he
would have done had he been aware of his son’s crime.  Notwithstanding,
though his opinion was neither inquired into nor ascertained, the people
stripped him of royalty; and when he returned to Rome with his army, it
was admitted, but he was excluded, abandoned by his troops, and the
gates shut in his face.  And yet, after he had appealed to the
neighboring states, and tormented the Romans with calamitous but
unsuccessful wars, and when he was deserted by the ally on whom he most
depended, despairing of regaining the kingdom, he lived a retired and
quiet life for fourteen years, as it is reported, in Tusculum, a Roman
town, where he grew old in his wife’s company, and at last terminated
his days in a much more desirable fashion than his father-in-law, who
had perished by the hand of his son-in-law; his own daughter abetting,
if report be true.  And this Tarquin the Romans called, not the Cruel,
nor the Infamous, but the Proud; their own pride perhaps resenting his
tyrannical airs.  So little did they make of his murdering their best
king, his own father-in-law, that they elected him their own king.  I
wonder if it was not even more criminal in them to reward so bountifully
so great a criminal.  And yet there was no word of the gods abandoning
the altars; unless, perhaps, some one will say in defence of the gods,
that they remained at Rome for the purpose of punishing the Romans,
rather than of aiding and profiting them, seducing them by empty
victories, and wearing them out by severe wars.  Such was the life of
the Romans under the kings during the much-praised epoch of the state
which extends to the expulsion of Tarquinius Superbus in the 243d year,
during which all those victories, which were bought with so much blood
and such disasters, hardly pushed Rome’s dominion twenty miles from the
city; a territory which would by no means bear comparison with that of
any petty Gætulian state.
