id="iv.X.7-p1.1"></span>Chapter 7.—Of the Love of the Holy Angels, Which
Prompts Them to Desire that We Worship the One True God, and Not
Themselves.</span>

<span id="iv.X.7-p2"></span>It is very right that these blessed and
immortal spirits, who inhabit celestial dwellings, and rejoice in the
communications of their Creator’s fullness, firm in His eternity,
assured in His truth, holy by His grace, since they compassionately and
tenderly regard us miserable mortals, and wish us to become immortal and
happy, do not desire us to sacrifice to themselves, but to Him whose
sacrifice they know themselves to be in common with us.  For we and they
together are the one city of God, to which it is said in the psalm,
“Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God;” <span
id="fr_397"></span>[398](#fn_397.md) the human part sojourning here below,
the angelic aiding from above.  For from that heavenly city, in which
God’s will is the intelligible and unchangeable law, from that heavenly
council-chamber,—for they sit in counsel regarding us,—that holy
Scripture, descended to us by the ministry of angels, in which it is
written, “He that sacrificeth unto any god, save unto the Lord only, he
shall be utterly destroyed,” <span id="fr_398"></span>[399](#fn_398.md)
—this Scripture, this law, these precepts, have been confirmed by such
miracles, that it is sufficiently evident to whom these immortal and
blessed spirits, who desire us to be like themselves, wish us to
sacrifice.
