<span id="iv.IV.16-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.IV.16-p1.1"></span>Chapter 16.—What Was the Reason Why the
Romans, in Detailing Separate Gods for All Things and All Movements of
the Mind, Chose to Have the Temple of Quiet Outside the Gates.</span>

<span id="iv.IV.16-p2"></span>But I wonder very much, that while they
assigned to separate gods single things, and (well nigh) all movements
of the mind; that while they invoked the goddess Agenoria, who should
excite to action; the goddess Stimula, who should stimulate to unusual
action; the goddess Murcia, who should not move men beyond measure, but
make them, as Pomponius says, murcid—that is, too slothful and inactive;
the goddess Strenua, who should make them strenuous; and that while they
offered to all these gods and goddesses solemn and public worship, they
should yet have been <span id="page_73">p. 73</span> <span
id="iv.IV.16-Page_73"></span> unwilling to give public acknowledgment to
her whom they name Quies because she makes men quiet, but built her
temple outside the Colline gate.  Whether was this a symptom of an
unquiet mind, or rather was it thus intimated that he who should
persevere in worshipping that crowd, not, to be sure, of gods, but of
demons, could not dwell with quiet; to which the true Physician calls,
saying, “Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye shall
find rest unto your souls?”
