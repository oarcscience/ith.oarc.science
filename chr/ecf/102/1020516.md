<span id="iv.XVII.23-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XVII.23-p1.1"></span>Chapter 23.—Of the Varying Condition of Both
the Hebrew Kingdoms, Until the People of Both Were at Different Times
Led into Captivity, Judah Being Afterwards Recalled into His Kingdom,
Which Finally Passed into the Power of the Romans.</span>

<span id="iv.XVII.23-p2"></span>So also in the kingdom of Judah
pertaining to Jerusalem prophets were not lacking even in the times of
succeeding kings, just as it pleased God to send them, either for the
prediction of what was needful, or for correction of sin and instruction
in righteousness; <span id="fr_1131"></span>[1132](#fn_1131) for there,
too, although far less than in Israel, kings arose who grievously
offended God by their impieties, and, along with their people, who were
like them, were smitten with moderate scourges.  The no small merits of
the pious kings there are praised indeed.  But we read that in Israel
the kings were, some more, others less, yet all wicked.  Each part,
therefore, as the divine providence either ordered or permitted, was
both lifted up by prosperity and weighed down by adversity of various
kinds; and it was afflicted not only by foreign, but also by civil wars
with each other, in order that by certain existing causes the mercy or
anger of God might be manifested; until, by His growing indignation,
that whole nation was by the conquering Chaldeans not only overthrown in
its abode, but also for the most part transported to the lands of the
Assyrians,—first, that part of the thirteen tribes called Israel, but
afterwards Judah also, when Jerusalem and that most noble temple was
cast down,—in which lands it rested seventy years in captivity.  Being
after that time sent forth thence, they rebuilt the overthrown temple. 
And although very many stayed in the lands of the strangers, yet the
kingdom no longer had two separate parts, with different kings over
each, but in Jerusalem there was <span id="page_360">p. 360</span> <span
id="iv.XVII.23-Page_360"></span> one prince over them; and at certain
times, from every direction wherever they were, and from whatever place
they could, they all came to the temple of God which was there.  Yet not
even then were they without foreign enemies and conquerors; yea, Christ
found them tributaries of the Romans.
