<span id="iv.XX.14-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XX.14-p1.1"></span>Chapter 14.—Of the Damnation of the Devil and
His Adherents; And a Sketch of the Bodily Resurrection of All the Dead,
and of the Final Retributive Judgment.</span>

<span id="iv.XX.14-p2"></span>After this mention of the closing
persecution, he summarily indicates all that the devil, and the city of
which he is the prince, shall suffer in the last judgment.  For he says,
“And the devil who seduced them is cast into the lake of fire and
brimstone, in which are the beast and the false prophet, and they shall
be tormented day and night for ever and ever.”  We have already said
that by the beast is well understood the wicked city.  His false prophet
is either Antichrist or that image or figment of which we have spoken in
the same place.  After this he gives a brief narrative of the last
judgment itself, which shall take place at the second or bodily
resurrection of the dead, as it had been revealed to him:  “I saw a
throne great and white, and One sitting on it from whose face the heaven
and the earth fled away, and their place was not found.”  He does not
say, “I saw a throne great and white, and One sitting on it, and from
His face the heaven and the earth fled away,” for it had not happened
then, *i.e*., before the living and the dead were judged; but he says
that he saw Him sitting on the throne from whose face heaven and earth
fled away, but afterwards.  For when the judgment is finished, this
heaven and earth shall cease to be, and there will be a new heaven and a
new earth.  For this world shall pass away by transmutation, not by
absolute destruction.  And therefore the apostle says, “For the figure
of this world passeth away.  I would have you be without anxiety.” <span
id="fr_1382"></span>[1383](#fn_1382.md)   The figure, therefore, passes
away, not the nature.  After John had said that he had seen One sitting
on the throne from whose face heaven and earth fled, though not till
afterwards, he said, “And I saw the dead, great and small:  and the
books were opened; and another book was opened, which is the book of the
life of each man:  and the dead were judged out of those things which
were written in the books, according to their deeds.”  He said that the
books were opened, and a book; but he left us at a loss as to the nature
of this book, “which is,” he says, “the book of the life of each man.” 
By those books, then, which he first mentioned, we are to understand the
sacred books old and new, that out of them it might be shown what
commandments God had enjoined; and that book of the life of each man is
to show what commandments each man has done or omitted to do.  If this
book be materially considered, who can reckon its size or length, or the
time it would take to read a book in which the whole life of every man
is recorded?  Shall there be present as many angels as men, and shall
each man hear his life recited by the angel assigned to him?  In that
case there will be not one book containing all the lives, but a separate
book for every life.  But our passage requires us to think of one only. 
“And another book was opened,” it says.  We must therefore understand it
of a certain divine power, by which it shall be brought about that every
one shall recall to memory all his own works, whether good or evil, and
shall mentally survey them with a marvellous rapidity, so that this
knowledge will either accuse or excuse conscience, and thus all and each
shall be simultaneously judged.  And this divine power is called a book,
because in it we shall as it were read all that it causes us to
remember.  That he may show who the dead, small and great, are who are
to be judged, he recurs to this which he had omitted or rather deferred,
and says, “And the sea presented the dead which were in it; and death
and hell gave up the dead which were in them.”  This of course took
place before the dead were judged, yet it is mentioned after.  And so, I
say, he returns again to what he had omitted.  But now he preserves the
order of events, and for the sake of exhibiting it repeats in its own
proper place what he had already said regarding the dead who were
judged.  For after he had said, “And the sea presented the dead which
were in it, and death and hell gave up the dead which were in them,” he
immediately subjoined what he had already said, “and they were judged
every man according to their works.”  For this is just what he had said
before, “And the dead were judged according to their works.”
