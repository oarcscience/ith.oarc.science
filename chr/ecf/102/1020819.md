<span id="v.IV_1.1-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="v.IV_1.1-p1.1"></span>Chapter 1.—This Work Not Intended as a
Treatise on Rhetoric.</span>

<span id="v.IV_1.1-p2"></span>1.  <span class="c20"><span
id="v.IV_1.1-p2.1"></span>This</span> work of mine, which is entitled
*On Christian Doctrine*, was at the commencement divided into two
parts.  For, after a preface, in which I answered by anticipation those
who were likely to take exception to the work, I said, “There are two
things on which all interpretation of Scripture depends:  the mode of
ascertaining the proper meaning, and the mode of making known the
meaning when it is ascertained.  I shall treat first of the mode of
ascertaining, next of the mode of making known, the meaning.” <span
id="fr_1934"></span>[1935](#fn_1934)   As, then, I have already said a
great deal about the mode of ascertaining the meaning, and have given
three books to this one part of the subject, I shall only say a few
things about the mode of making known the meaning, in order if possible
to bring them all within the compass of one book, and so finish the
whole work in four books.

<span id="v.IV_1.1-p4"></span>2.  In the first place, then, I wish by
this preamble to put a stop to the expectations of readers who may think
that I am about to lay <span id="page_575">p. 575</span> <span
id="v.IV_1.1-Page_575"></span> down rules of rhetoric such as I have
learnt, and taught too, in the secular schools, and to warn them that
they need not look for any such from me.  Not that I think such rules of
no use, but that whatever use they have is to be learnt elsewhere; and
if any good man should happen to have leisure for learning them, he is
not to ask me to teach them either in this work or any other.
