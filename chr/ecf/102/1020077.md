id="iv.III.4-p1.1"></span>Chapter 4.—Of Varro’s Opinion, that It is
Useful for Men to Feign Themselves the Offspring of the Gods.</span>

<span id="iv.III.4-p2"></span>Some one will say, But do you believe all
this?  Not I indeed.  For even Varro, a very learned heathen, all but
admits that these stories are false, though he does not boldly and
confidently say so.  But he maintains it is useful for states that brave
men believe, though falsely, that they are descended from the gods; for
that thus the human spirit, cherishing the belief of its divine descent,
will both more boldly venture into great enterprises, and will carry
them out more energetically, and will therefore by its very confidence
secure more abundant success.  You see how wide a field is opened to
falsehood by this opinion of Varro’s, which I have expressed as well as
I could in my own words; and how comprehensible it is, that many of the
religions and sacred legends should be feigned in a community in which
it was judged profitable for the citizens that lies should be told even
about the gods themselves.
