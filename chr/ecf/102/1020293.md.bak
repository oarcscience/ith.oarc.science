id="iv.X.22-p1.1"></span>Chapter 22.—Whence the Saints Derive Power
Against Demons and True Purification of Heart.</span>

<span id="iv.X.22-p2"></span>It is by true piety that men of God cast
out the hostile power of the air which opposes godliness; it is by
exorcising it, not by propitiating it; and they overcome all the
temptations of the adversary by praying, not to him, but to their own
God against him.  For the devil cannot conquer or subdue any but those
who are in league with sin; and therefore he is conquered in the name of
Him who assumed humanity, and that without sin, that Himself being both
Priest and Sacrifice, He might bring about the remission of sins, that
is to say, might bring it about through the Mediator between God and
men, the man Christ Jesus, by whom we are reconciled to God, the
cleansing from sin being accomplished.  For men are separated from God
only by sins, from which we are in this life cleansed not by our own
virtue, but by the divine compassion; through His indulgence, not
through our own power.  For, whatever virtue we call our own is itself
bestowed upon us by His goodness.  And we might attribute too much to
ourselves while in the flesh, unless we lived in the receipt of pardon
until we laid it down.  This is the reason why there has been vouchsafed
to us, through the Mediator, this grace, that we who are polluted by
sinful flesh should be cleansed by the likeness of sinful flesh.  By
this grace of God, wherein He has shown His great compassion toward us,
we are both governed by faith in this life, and, after this life, are
led onwards to the fullest perfection by the vision of immutable truth.
