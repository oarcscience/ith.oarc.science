<span id="iv.IV.14-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.IV.14-p1.1"></span>Chapter 14.—The Enlargement of Kingdoms is
Unsuitably Ascribed to Jove; For If, as They Will Have It, Victoria is a
Goddess, She Alone Would Suffice for This Business.</span>

<span id="iv.IV.14-p2"></span>Here, first of all, I ask, why even the
kingdom itself is not some god.  For why should not it also be so, if
Victory is a goddess?  Or what need is there of Jove himself in this
affair, if Victory favors and is propitious, and always goes to those
whom she wishes to be victorious?  With this goddess favorable and
propitious, even if Jove was idle and did nothing, what nations could
remain unsubdued, what kingdom would not yield?  But perhaps it is
displeasing to good men to fight with most wicked unrighteousness, and
provoke with voluntary war neighbors who are peaceable and do no wrong,
in order to enlarge a kingdom?  If they feel thus, I entirely approve
and praise them.
