<span id="v.iv.xxviii-p2"></span>29.  Further, all men are to be loved
equally.  But since you cannot do good to all, you are to pay special
regard to those who, by the accidents of time, or place, or
circumstance, are brought into closer connection with you.  For, suppose
that you had a great deal of some commodity, and felt bound to give it
away to somebody who had none, and that it could not be given to more
than one person; if two persons presented themselves, neither of whom
had either from need or relationship a greater claim upon you than the
other, you could do nothing fairer than choose by lot to which you would
give what could not be given to both.  Just so among men:  since you
cannot consult for the good of them all, you must take the matter as
decided for you by a sort of lot, according as each man happens for the
time being to be more closely connected with you.
