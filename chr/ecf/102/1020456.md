id="iv.XVI.7-p1.1"></span>Chapter 7.—Whether Even the Remotest Islands
Received Their Fauna from the Animals Which Were Preserved, Through the
Deluge, in the Ark.</span>

<span id="iv.XVI.7-p2"></span>There is a question raised about all those
kinds of beasts which are not domesticated, nor are produced like frogs
from the earth, but are propagated by male and female parents, such as
wolves and animals of that kind; and it is asked how they could be found
in the islands after the deluge, in which all the animals not in the ark
perished, unless the breed was restored from those which were preserved
in pairs in the ark.  It might, indeed, be said that they crossed to the
islands by swimming, but this could only be true of those very near the
mainland; whereas there are some so distant, that we fancy no animal
could swim to them.  But if men caught them and took them across with
themselves, and thus propagated these breeds in their new abodes, this
would not imply an incredible fondness for the chase.  At the same time,
it cannot be denied that by the intervention of angels they might be
transferred by God’s order or permission.  If, however, they were
produced out of the earth as at their first creation, when God said,
“Let the earth bring forth the living creature,” <span
id="fr_881"></span>[882](#fn_881.md) this makes it more evident that all
kinds of animals were preserved in the ark, not so much for the sake of
renewing the stock, as of prefiguring the various nations which were to
be saved in the church; this, I say, is more evident, if the earth
brought forth many animals in islands to which they could not cross
over.
