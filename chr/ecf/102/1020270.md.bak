<span id="iv.IX.23-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.IX.23-p1.1"></span>Chapter 23.—That the Name of Gods is Falsely
Given to the Gods of the Gentiles, Though Scripture Applies It Both to
the Holy Angels and Just Men.</span>

<span id="iv.IX.23-p2"></span>If the Platonists prefer to call these
angels gods rather than demons, and to reckon them with those whom
Plato, their founder and master, maintains were created by the supreme
God, <span id="fr_361"></span>[362](#fn_361.md) they are welcome to do so,
for I will not spend strength in fighting about words.  For if they say
that these beings are immortal, and yet created by the supreme God,
blessed but by cleaving to their Creator and not by their own power,
they say what we say, whatever name they call these beings by.  And that
this is the opinion either of all or the best of the Platonists can be
ascertained by their writings.  And regarding the name itself, if they
see fit to call such blessed and immortal creatures gods, this need not
give rise to any serious discussion between us, since in our own
Scriptures we read, “The God of gods, the Lord hath spoken;” <span
id="fr_362"></span>[363](#fn_362.md) and again, “Confess to the God of
gods;” <span id="fr_363"></span>[364](#fn_363.md) and again, “He is a great
King above all gods.” <span id="fr_364"></span>[365](#fn_364.md)   And
where it is said, “He is to be feared above all gods,” the reason is
forthwith added, for it follows, “for all the gods of the nations are
idols, but the Lord made the heavens.” <span
id="fr_365"></span>[366](#fn_365.md)   He said, “above all gods,” but
added, “of the nations;” that is to say, above all those whom the
nations count gods, in other words, demons.  By them He is to be feared
with that terror in which they cried to the Lord, “Hast Thou come to
destroy us?”  But where it is said, “the God of gods,” it cannot be
understood as the god of the demons; and far be it from us to say that
“great King above all gods” means “great King above all demons.”  But
the same Scripture also calls men who belong to God’s people “gods:”  “I
have said, Ye are gods, and all of you children of the Most High.” <span
id="fr_366"></span>[367](#fn_366.md)   Accordingly, when God is styled God
of gods, this may be understood of these gods; and so, too, when He is
styled a great King above all gods.

<span id="iv.IX.23-p9"></span> Nevertheless, some one may say, if men
are called gods because they belong to God’s people, whom He addresses
by means of men and angels, are not the immortals, who already enjoy
that felicity which men seek to attain by worshipping God, much more
worthy of the title?  And what shall we reply to this, if not that it is
not without reason that in holy Scripture men are more expressly styled
gods than those immortal and blessed spirits to whom we hope to be equal
in the resurrection, because there was a fear that the weakness of
unbelief, being overcome with the excellence of these beings, might
presume to constitute some of them a god?  In the case of men this was a
result that need not be guarded against.  Besides, it was right that the
men belonging to God’s people should be more expressly called gods, to
assure and certify them that He who is called God of gods is their God;
because, although those immortal and blessed spirits who dwell in the
heavens are called gods, yet they are not called gods of gods, that is
to say, gods of the men who constitute God’s people, and to whom it is
said, “I have said, Ye are gods, and all of you the children of the Most
High.”  Hence the saying of the apostle, “Though there be that are
called gods, whether in heaven or in earth, as there be gods many and
lords many, but to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all
things, and we in Him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all
things, and we by Him.” <span id="fr_367"></span>[368](#fn_367.md)

<span id="iv.IX.23-p11"></span>We need not, therefore, laboriously
contend about the name, since the reality is so obvious as to admit of
no shadow of doubt.  That which we say, that the angels who are sent to
announce the will of God to men belong to the order of blessed
immortals, does not satisfy the Platonists, because they believe that
this ministry is discharged, not by those whom they call gods, in other
words, not by blessed immortals, but by demons, whom they dare not
affirm to be blessed, but only immortal, or if they do rank them among
the blessed immortals, yet only as good demons, and not as gods who
dwell in the heaven of heavens remote from all human contact.  But,
though it may seem mere wrangling about a name, yet the name of demon is
so detestable that we cannot bear in any sense to apply it to the holy
angels.  Now, therefore, let us close this book in the assurance that,
whatever we call these immortal and blessed spirits, who yet are only
creatures, they do not act as mediators to introduce to everlasting
felicity miserable mortals, from whom they are severed by a twofold
distinction.  And those others who are mediators, in so far as they have
immortality in common with their superiors, and misery in common with
their inferiors (for they are justly miserable in punishment of their
wickedness), cannot bestow upon us, but rather grudge that we should
possess, the blessedness from which they themselves are excluded.  And
so the friends of the demons have nothing considerable to allege why we
should rather worship them as <span id="page_179">p. 179</span> <span
id="iv.IX.23-Page_179"></span> our helpers than avoid them as traitors
to our interests.  As for those spirits who are good, and who are
therefore not only immortal but also blessed, and to whom they suppose
we should give the title of gods, and offer worship and sacrifices for
the sake of inheriting a future life, we shall, by God’s help, endeavor
in the following book to show that these spirits, call them by what
name, and ascribe to them what nature you will, desire that religious
worship be paid to God alone, by whom they were created, and by whose
communications of Himself to them they are blessed.
