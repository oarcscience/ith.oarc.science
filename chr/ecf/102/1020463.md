id="iv.XVI.14-p1.1"></span>Chapter 14.—Of the Years of Terah, Who
Completed His Lifetime in Haran.</span>

<span id="iv.XVI.14-p2"></span>On Terah’s death in Mesopotamia, where he
is said to have lived 205 years, the promises of God made to Abraham now
begin to be pointed out; for thus it is written:  “And the days of Terah
in Haran were two hundred and five years, and he died in Haran.” <span
id="fr_892"></span>[893](#fn_892)   This is not to be taken as if he had
spent all his days there, but that he there completed the days of his
life, which were two hundred and five years:  otherwise it would not be
known how many years Terah lived, since it is not said in what year of
his life he came into Haran; and it is absurd to suppose that, in this
series of generations, where it is carefully recorded how many years
each one lived, his age was the only one not put on record.  For
although some whom the same Scripture mentions have not their age
recorded, they are not in this series, in which the reckoning of time is
continuously indicated by the death of the parents and the succession of
the children.  For this series, which is given in order from Adam to
Noah, and from him down to Abraham, contains no one without the number
of the years of his life.
