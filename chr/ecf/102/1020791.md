<span id="v.vi.xi-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="v.vi.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 11.—Rule for Interpreting Phrases Which
Seem to Ascribe Severity to God and the Saints.</span>

<span id="v.vi.xi-p2"></span>17.  Every severity, therefore, and
apparent cruelty, either in word or deed, that is ascribed in Holy
Scripture to God or His saints, avails to the pulling down of the
dominion of lust.  And if its meaning be clear, we are not to give it
some secondary reference, as if it were spoken figuratively.  Take, for
example, that saying of the apostle:  “But, after thy hardness and
impenitent heart, treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of
wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God; who will render
to every man according to his deeds:  to them who, by patient
continuance in well-doing, seek for glory, and honor, and immortality,
eternal life; but unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the
truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath, tribulation and
anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and
also of the Gentile.” <span id="fr_1860"></span>[1861](#fn_1860.md)   But
this is addressed to those who, being unwilling to subdue their lust,
are themselves involved in the destruction of their lust.  When,
however, the dominion of lust is overturned in a man over whom it had
held sway, this plain expression is used:  “They that are Christ’s have
crucified the flesh, with the affections and lusts.” <span
id="fr_1861"></span>[1862](#fn_1861.md)   Only that, even in these
instances, some words are used figuratively, as for example, “the wrath
of God” and “crucified.”  But these are not so numerous, nor placed in
such a way as to obscure the sense, and make it allegorical or
enigmatical, which is the kind of expression properly called
*figurative*.  But in the saying addressed to Jeremiah, “See, I have
this day set thee over the nations, and over the kingdoms, to root out,
and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw down,” <span
id="fr_1862"></span>[1863](#fn_1862.md) there is no doubt the whole of the
language is figurative, and to be referred to the end I have spoken of.
