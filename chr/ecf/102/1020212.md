id="iv.VII.29-p1.1"></span>Chapter 29.—That All Things Which the
Physical Theologists Have Referred to the World and Its Parts, They
Ought to Have Referred to the One True God.</span>

<span id="iv.VII.29-p2"></span>For all those things which, according to
the account given of those gods, are referred to the world by so-called
physical interpretation, may, without any religious scruple, be rather
assigned to the true God, who made heaven and earth, and created every
soul and every body; and the following is the manner in which we see
that this may be done.  We worship God,—not heaven and earth, of which
two parts this world consists, nor the soul or souls diffused through
all living things,—but God who made heaven and earth, and all things
which are in them; who made every soul, whatever be the nature of its
life, whether it have life without sensation and reason, or life with
sensation, or life with both sensation and reason.
