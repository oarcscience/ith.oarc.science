id="iv.IX.18-p1.1"></span>Chapter 18.—That the Deceitful Demons, While
Promising to Conduct Men to God by Their Intercession, Mean to Turn Them
from the Path of Truth.</span>

<span id="iv.IX.18-p2"></span>As to the demons, these false and
deceitful mediators, who, though their uncleanness of spirit frequently
reveals their misery and malignity, yet, by virtue of the levity of
their aerial bodies and the nature of the places they inhabit, do
contrive to turn us aside and hinder our spiritual progress; they do not
help us towards God, but rather prevent us from reaching Him.  Since
even in the bodily way, which is erroneous and misleading, and in which
righteousness does not walk,—for we must rise to God not by bodily
ascent, but by incorporeal or spiritual conformity to Him,—in this
bodily way, I say, which the friends of the demons arrange according to
the weight of the various elements, the aerial demons being set between
the ethereal gods and earthy men, they imagine the gods to have this
privilege, that by this local interval they are preserved from the
pollution of human contact.  Thus they believe that the demons are
contaminated by men rather than men cleansed by the demons, and that the
gods themselves should be polluted unless their local superiority
preserved them.  Who is so wretched a creature as to expect purification
by a way in which men are contaminating, demons contaminated, and gods
contaminable?  Who would not rather choose that way whereby we escape
the contamination of the demons, and are cleansed from pollution by the
incontaminable God, so as to be associated with the uncontaminated
angels?
