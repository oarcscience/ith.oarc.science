<span id="v.vi.xxxii-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="v.vi.xxxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 32.—The Second Rule of
Tichonius.</span>

<span id="v.vi.xxxii-p2"></span>45.  The second rule is about *the
twofold division of the body of the Lord*; but this indeed is not a
suitable name, for that is really no part of the body of Christ which
will not be with Him in eternity.  We ought, therefore, to say that the
rule is about the true and the mixed body of the Lord, or the true and
the counterfeit, or some such name; because, not to speak of eternity,
hypocrites cannot even now be said to be in Him, although they seem to
be in His Church.  And hence this rule might be designated thus: 
Concerning *the mixed Church*.  Now this rule requires the reader to be
on his guard when Scripture, although it has now come to address or
speak of a different set of persons, seems to be addressing or speaking
of the same persons as before, just as if both sets constituted one body
in consequence of their being for the time united in a common
participation of the sacraments.  An example of this is that passage in
the Song of Solomon, “I am black, but comely, as the tents of Kedar, as
the curtains of Solomon.” <span id="fr_1899"></span>[1900](#fn_1899.md)  
For it is not said, I was black as the tents of Kedar, but am now comely
as the curtains of Solomon.  The Church declares itself to be at present
both; and this because the good fish and the bad are for the time mixed
up in the one net. <span id="fr_1900"></span>[1901](#fn_1900.md)   For the
tents of Kedar pertain to Ishmael, who “shall not be heir with the son
of the free woman.” <span id="fr_1901"></span>[1902](#fn_1901.md)   And in
the same way, when God says of the good part of the Church, “I will
bring the blind by a way that they knew not; I will lead them in paths
that they have not known; I will make darkness light before them, and
crooked things straight:  these things will I do unto them, and not
forsake them;” <span id="fr_1902"></span>[1903](#fn_1902.md) He immediately
adds in regard to the other part, the bad that is mixed with the good,
“They shall be turned back.”  Now these words refer to a set of persons
altogether different from the former; but as the two sets are for the
present united in one body, He speaks as if there were no change in the
subject of the sentence.  They will not, however, always be in one body;
for one of them is that wicked servant of whom we are told in the
gospel, whose lord, when he comes, “shall cut him asunder and appoint
him his portion with the hypocrites.” <span
