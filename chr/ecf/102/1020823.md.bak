<span id="v.IV_1.5-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="v.IV_1.5-p1.1"></span>Chapter 5.—Wisdom of More Importance Than
Eloquence to the Christian Teacher.</span>

<span id="v.IV_1.5-p2"></span>But as some men employ these coarsely,
inelegantly, and frigidly, while others use them with acuteness,
elegance, and spirit, the work that I am speaking of ought to be
undertaken by one who can argue and speak with wisdom, if not with
eloquence, and with profit to his hearers, even though he profit them
less than he would if he could speak with eloquence too.  But we must
beware of the man who abounds in eloquent nonsense, and so much the more
if the hearer is pleased with what is not worth listening to, and thinks
that because the speaker is eloquent what he says must be true.  And
this opinion is held even by those who think that the art of rhetoric
should be taught; for they confess that “though wisdom without eloquence
is of little service to states, yet eloquence without wisdom is
frequently a positive injury, and is of service never.” <span
id="fr_1936"></span>[1937](#fn_1936.md)   If, then, the men who teach the
principles of eloquence have been forced by truth to confess this in the
very books which treat of eloquence, though they were ignorant of the
true, that is, the heavenly wisdom which comes down from the Father of
Lights, how much more ought we to feel it who are the sons and the
ministers of this higher wisdom!  Now a man speaks with more or less
wisdom just as he has made more or less progress in the knowledge of
Scripture; I do not mean by reading them much and committing them to
memory, but by understanding them aright and carefully searching into
their meaning.  For there are who read and yet neglect them; they read
to remember the words, but are careless about knowing the meaning.  It
is plain we must set far above these the men who are not so retentive of
the words, but see with the eyes of the heart into the heart of
Scripture.  Better than either of these, however, is the man who, when
he wishes, can repeat the words, and at the same time correctly
apprehends their meaning.

<span id="v.IV_1.5-p4"></span>8.  Now it is especially necessary for the
man who is bound to speak wisely, even though he cannot speak
eloquently, to retain in memory the words of Scripture.  For the more he
discerns the poverty of his own speech, the more he ought to draw on the
riches of Scripture, so that what he says in his own words he may prove
by the words of Scripture; and he himself, though small and weak in his
own words, may gain strength and power from the confirming testimony of
great men.  For his proof gives pleasure when he cannot please by his
mode of speech.  But if a man desire to speak not only with wisdom, but
with eloquence also (and assuredly he will prove of greater service if
<span id="page_577">p. 577</span> <span id="v.IV_1.5-Page_577"></span>
he can do both), I would rather send him to read, and listen to, and
exercise himself in imitating, eloquent men, than advise him to spend
time with the teachers of rhetoric; especially if the men he reads and
listens to are justly praised as having spoken, or as being accustomed
to speak, not only with eloquence, but with wisdom also.  For eloquent
speakers are heard with pleasure; wise speakers with profit.  And,
therefore, Scripture does not say that the multitude of the eloquent,
but “the multitude of the wise is the welfare of the world.” <span
id="fr_1937"></span>[1938](#fn_1937.md)   And as we must often swallow
wholesome bitters, so we must always avoid unwholesome sweets.  But what
is better than wholesome sweetness or sweet wholesomeness?  For the
sweeter we try to make such things, the easier it is to make their
wholesomeness serviceable.  And so there are writers of the Church who
have expounded the Holy Scriptures, not only with wisdom, but with
eloquence as well; and there is not more time for the reading of these
than is sufficient for those who are studious and at leisure to exhaust
them.
