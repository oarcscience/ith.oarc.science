<span id="iv.XVI.42-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XVI.42-p1.1"></span>Chapter 42.—Of the Sons of Joseph, Whom Jacob
Blessed, Prophetically Changing His Hands.</span>

<span id="iv.XVI.42-p2"></span>Now, as Isaac’s two sons, Esau and Jacob,
furnished a type of the two people, the Jews and the Christians
(although as pertains to carnal descent it was not the Jews but the
Idumeans who came of the seed of Esau, nor the Christian nations but
rather the Jews who came of Jacob’s; for the type holds only as regards
the saying, “The elder shall serve the younger” <span
id="fr_976"></span>[977](#fn_976) .md), so the same thing happened in
Joseph’s two sons; for the elder was a type of the Jews, and the younger
of the Christians.  For when Jacob was blessing them, and laid his right
hand on the younger, who was at his left, and his left hand on the
elder, who was at his right, this seemed wrong to their father, and he
admonished his father by trying to correct his mistake and show him
which was the elder.  But he would not change his hands, but said, “I
know, my son, I know.  He also shall become a people, and he also shall
be exalted; but his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his
seed shall become a multitude of nations.” <span
id="fr_977"></span>[978](#fn_977.md)   And these two promises show the same
thing.  For that one is to become “a people;” this one “a multitude of
nations.”  And what can be more evident than that these two promises
comprehend the people of Israel, and the whole world of Abraham’s seed,
the one according to the flesh, the other according to faith?
