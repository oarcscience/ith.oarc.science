<span id="iv.ii.viii-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.ii.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 7.—That the Cruelties Which Occurred
in the Sack of Rome Were in Accordance with the Custom of War, Whereas
the Acts of Clemency Resulted from the Influence of Christ’s
Name.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.viii-p2"></span>All the spoiling, then, which Rome was
exposed to in the recent calamity—all the slaughter, plundering,
burning, and misery—was the result of the custom of war.  But what was
novel, was that savage barbarians showed themselves in so gentle a
guise, that the largest churches were chosen and set apart for the
purpose of being filled with the people to whom quarter was given, and
that in them none were slain, from them none forcibly dragged; that into
them many were led by their relenting enemies to be set at liberty, and
that from them none were led into slavery by merciless foes.  Whoever
does not see that this is to be attributed to the name of Christ, and to
the Christian temper, is blind; whoever sees this, and gives no praise,
is ungrateful; whoever hinders any one from praising it, is mad.  Far be
it from any prudent man to impute this clemency to the barbarians. 
Their fierce and bloody minds were awed, and bridled, and marvellously
tempered by Him who so long before said by His prophet, “I will visit
their transgression with the rod, and their iniquities with stripes;
nevertheless my loving-kindness will I not utterly take from
them.” <span id="fr_46"></span>[47](#fn_46.md)
