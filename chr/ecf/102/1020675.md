id="iv.XXII.14-p1.1"></span>Chapter 14.—Whether Infants Shall Rise in
that Body Which They Would Have Had Had They Grown Up.</span>

<span id="iv.XXII.14-p2"></span>What, then, are we to say of infants, if
not that they will not rise in that diminutive body in which they died,
but shall receive by the marvellous and rapid operation of God that body
which time by a slower process would have given them?  For in the Lord’s
words, where He says, “Not a hair of your head <span id="page_495">p.
495</span> <span id="iv.XXII.14-Page_495"></span> shall perish,” <span
id="fr_1630"></span>[1631](#fn_1630.md) it is asserted that nothing which
was possessed shall be wanting; but it is not said that nothing which
was not possessed shall be given.  To the dead infant there was wanting
the perfect stature of its body; for even the perfect infant lacks the
perfection of bodily size, being capable of further growth.  This
perfect stature is, in a sense, so possessed by all that they are
conceived and born with it,—that is, they have it potentially, though
not yet in actual bulk; just as all the members of the body are
potentially in the seed, though, even after the child is born, some of
them, the teeth for example, may be wanting.  In this seminal principle
of every substance, there seems to be, as it were, the beginning of
everything which does not yet exist, or rather does not appear, but
which in process of time will come into being, or rather into sight.  In
this, therefore, the child who is to be tall or short is already tall or
short.  And in the resurrection of the body, we need, for the same
reason, fear no bodily loss; for though all should be of equal size, and
reach gigantic proportions, lest the men who were largest here should
lose anything of their bulk and it should perish, in contradiction to
the words of Christ, who said that not a hair of their head should
perish, yet why should there lack the means by which that wonderful
Worker should make such additions, seeing that He is the Creator, who
Himself created all things out of nothing?
