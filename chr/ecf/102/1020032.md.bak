<span id="iv.ii.xxvii-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.ii.xxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 26.—That in Certain Peculiar Cases
the Examples of the Saints are Not to Be Followed.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.xxvii-p2"></span>But, they say, in the time of
persecution some holy women escaped those who menaced them with outrage,
by casting themselves into rivers which they knew would drown them; and
having died in this manner, they are venerated in the church catholic as
martyrs.  Of such persons I do not presume to speak rashly.  I cannot
tell whether there may not have been vouchsafed to the church some
divine authority, proved by trustworthy evidences, for so honoring their
memory:  it may be that it is so.  It may be they were not deceived by
human judgment, but prompted by divine wisdom, to their act of
self-destruction.  We know that this was the case with Samson.  And when
God enjoins any act, and intimates by plain evidence that He has
enjoined it, who will call obedience criminal?  Who will accuse so
religious a submission?  But then every man is not justified in
sacrificing his son to God, because Abraham was commendable in so
doing.  The soldier who has slain a man in obedience to the authority
under which he is lawfully commissioned, is not accused of murder by any
law of his state; nay, if he has not slain him, it is then he is accused
of treason to the state, and of despising the law.  But if he has been
acting on his own authority, and at his own impulse, he has in this case
incurred the crime of shedding human blood.  And thus he is punished for
doing without orders the very thing he is punished for neglecting to do
when he has been ordered.  If the commands of a general make so great a
difference, shall the commands of God make none?  He, then, who knows it
is unlawful to kill himself, may nevertheless do so if he is ordered by
Him whose commands we may not neglect.  Only let him be very sure that
the divine command has been signified.  As for us, we can become privy
to the secrets of conscience only in so far as these are disclosed to
us, and so far only do we judge:  “No one knoweth the things of a man,
save the spirit of man which is in him.” <span
id="fr_79"></span>[80](#fn_79.md)   But this we affirm, this we maintain,
this we every way pronounce to be right, that no man ought to inflict on
himself voluntary death, for this is to escape the ills of time by
plunging into those of eternity; that no man ought to do so on account
of another man’s sins, for this were to escape a guilt which could not
pollute him, by incurring great guilt of his own; that no man ought to
do so on account of his own past sins, for he has all the more need of
this life that these sins may be healed by repentance; that no man
should put an end to this life to obtain that better life we look for
after death, for <span id="page_18">p. 18</span> <span
id="iv.ii.xxvii-Page_18"></span> those who die by their own hand have no
better life after death.
