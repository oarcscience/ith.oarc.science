<span id="v.v.xiv-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="v.v.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 14.—How the Meaning of Unknown Words
and Idioms is to Be Discovered.</span>

<span id="v.v.xiv-p2"></span>21.  About ambiguous signs, however, I
shall speak afterwards.  I am treating at present of unknown signs, of
which, as far as the words are concerned, there are two kinds.  For
either a word or an idiom, of which the reader is ignorant, brings him
to a stop.  Now if these belong to foreign tongues, we must either make
inquiry about them from men who speak those tongues, or if we have
leisure we must learn the tongues ourselves, or we must consult and
compare several translators.  If, however, there are words or idioms in
our own tongue that we are unacquainted with, we gradually come to know
them through being accustomed to read or to hear them.  There is nothing
that it is better to commit to memory than those kinds of words and
phrases whose meaning we do not know, so that where we happen to meet
either with a more learned man of whom we can inquire, or with a passage
that shows, either by the preceding or succeeding context, or by both,
the force and significance of the phrase we are ignorant of, we can
easily by the help of our memory turn our attention to the matter and
learn all about it.  So great, however, is the force of custom, even in
regard to learning, that those who have been in a sort of way nurtured
and brought up on the study of Holy Scripture, are surprised at other
forms of speech, and think them less pure Latin than those which they
have learnt from Scripture, but which are not to be found in Latin
authors.  In this matter, too, the great number of the translators
proves a very great assistance, if they are examined and discussed with
a careful comparison of their texts.  Only all positive error must be
removed.  For those who are anxious to know, the Scriptures ought in the
first place to use their skill in the correction of the texts, so that
the uncorrected ones should give way to the corrected, at least when
they are copies of the same translation.
