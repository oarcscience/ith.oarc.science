id="iv.XVIII.49-p1.1"></span>Chapter 49.—Of the Indiscriminate Increase
of the Church, Wherein Many Reprobate are in This World Mixed with the
Elect.</span>

<span id="iv.XVIII.49-p2"></span>In this wicked world, in these evil
days, when the Church measures her future loftiness by her present
humility, and is exercised by goading fears, tormenting sorrows,
disquieting labors, and dangerous temptations, when she soberly
rejoices, rejoicing only in hope, there are many reprobate mingled with
the good, and both are gathered together by the gospel as in a drag
net; <span id="fr_1235"></span>[1236](#fn_1235) and in this world, as in
a sea, both swim enclosed without distinction in the net, until it is
brought ashore, when the wicked must be separated from the good, that in
the good, as in His temple, God may be all in all.  We acknowledge,
indeed, that His word is now fulfilled who spake in the psalm, and said,
“I have announced and spoken; they are multiplied above number.” <span
id="fr_1236"></span>[1237](#fn_1236)   This takes place now, since He
has spoken, first by the mouth of his forerunner John, and afterward by
His own mouth, saying, “Repent:  for the kingdom of heaven is at
hand.” <span id="fr_1237"></span>[1238](#fn_1237)   He chose disciples,
whom He also called apostles, <span id="fr_1238"></span>[1239](#fn_1238)
of lowly birth, unhonored, and illiterate, so that whatever great thing
they might be or do, He might be and do it in them.  He had one among
them whose wickedness He could use well in order to accomplish His
appointed passion, and furnish His Church an example of bearing with the
wicked.  Having sown the holy gospel as much as that behoved to be done
by His bodily presence, He suffered, died, and rose again, showing by
His passion what we ought to suffer for the truth, and by His
resurrection what we ought to hope for in adversity; saving always the
mystery of the sacrament, by which His blood was shed for the remission
of sins.  He held converse on the earth forty days with His disciples,
and in their sight ascended into heaven, and after ten days sent the
promised Holy Spirit.  It was given as the chief and most necessary sign
of His coming on those who had believed, that every one of them spoke in
the tongues of all nations; thus signifying that the unity of the
catholic Church would embrace all nations, and would in like manner
speak in all tongues.
