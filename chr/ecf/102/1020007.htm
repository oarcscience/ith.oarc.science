<p class="c21"><a name="iv.ii.ii-p2"></A>For to this earthly city belong the enemies against whom I have to defend the city of God.&#160; Many of them, indeed, being reclaimed from their ungodly error, have become sufficiently creditable citizens of this city; but  <A NAME="page_2"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 2</FONT></A> <a name="iv.ii.ii-Page_2"></A>  many are so inflamed with hatred against it, and are so ungrateful to its Redeemer for His signal benefits, as to forget that they would now be unable to utter a single word to its prejudice, had they not found in its sacred places, as they fled from the enemy&#146;s steel, that life in which they now boast themselves.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_32"></A><A HREF="#fn_32"><FONT SIZE="1">33</FONT></A>
&#160; Are not those very Romans, who were spared by the barbarians through their respect for Christ, become enemies to the name of Christ?&#160; The reliquaries of the martyrs and the churches of the apostles bear witness to this; for in the sack of the city they were open sanctuary for all who fled to them, whether Christian or Pagan.&#160; To their very threshold the blood-thirsty enemy raged; there his murderous fury owned a limit.&#160; Thither did such of the enemy as had any pity convey those to whom they had given quarter, lest any less mercifully disposed might fall upon them.&#160; And, indeed, when even those murderers who everywhere else showed themselves pitiless came to those spots where that was forbidden which the license of war permitted in every other place, their furious rage for slaughter was bridled, and their eagerness to take prisoners was quenched.&#160; Thus escaped multitudes who now reproach the Christian religion, and impute to Christ the ills that have befallen their city; but the preservation of their own life&#8212;a boon which they owe to the respect entertained for Christ by the barbarians&#8212;they attribute not to our Christ, but to their own good luck.&#160; They ought rather, had they any right perceptions, to attribute the severities and hardships inflicted by their enemies, to that divine providence which is wont to reform the depraved manners of men by chastisement, and which exercises with similar afflictions the righteous and praiseworthy,&#8212;either translating them, when they have passed through the trial, to a better world, or detaining them still on earth for ulterior purposes.&#160; And they ought to attribute it to the spirit of these Christian times, that, contrary to the custom of war, these bloodthirsty barbarians spared them, and spared them for Christ&#146;s sake, whether this mercy was actually shown in promiscuous places, or in those places specially dedicated to Christ&#146;s name, and of which the very largest were selected as sanctuaries, that full scope might thus be given to the expansive compassion which desired that a large multitude might find shelter there.&#160; Therefore ought they to give God thanks, and with sincere confession flee for refuge to His name, that so they may escape the punishment of eternal fire&#8212;they who with lying lips took upon them this name, that they might escape the punishment of present destruction.&#160; For of those whom you see insolently and shamelessly insulting the servants of Christ, there are numbers who would not have escaped that destruction and slaughter had they not pretended that they themselves were Christ&#146;s servants.&#160; Yet now, in ungrateful pride and most impious madness, and at the risk of being punished in everlasting darkness, they perversely oppose that name under which they fraudulently protected themselves for the sake of enjoying the light of this brief life.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="iv.ii.ii-p3"></A> [Aug. refers to the sacking of the city of Rome by the West-Gothic King Alaric, 410.&#160; He was the most humane of the barbaric invaders and conquerors of Rome, and had embraced Arian Christianity (probably from the teaching of Ulphilas, the Arian bishop and translator of the Bible).&#160; He spared the Catholic Christians.&#8212;For particulars see Gibbon&#146;s <i>Decline and Fall</i>, and Millman&#146;s <i>Latin Christianity.</i>&#8212;P.S.]</p>
