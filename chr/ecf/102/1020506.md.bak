<span id="iv.XVII.13-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XVII.13-p1.1"></span>Chapter 13.—Whether the Truth of This
Promised Peace Can Be Ascribed to Those Times Passed Away Under
Solomon.</span>

<span id="iv.XVII.13-p2"></span>Whoever hopes for this so great good in
this world, and in this earth, his wisdom is but folly.  Can any one
think it was fulfilled in the peace of Solomon’s reign?  Scripture
certainly commends that peace with excellent praise as a shadow of that
which is to come.  But this opinion is to be vigilantly opposed, since
after it is said, “And the son of iniquity shall not humble him any
more,” it is immediately added, “as from the beginning, from the days in
which I appointed judges over my people Israel.” <span
id="fr_1077"></span>[1078](#fn_1077.md)   For the judges were appointed
over that people from the time when they received the land of promise,
before kings had begun to be there.  And certainly the son of iniquity,
that is, the foreign enemy, humbled him through periods of time in which
we read that peace alternated with wars; and in that period longer times
of peace are found than Solomon had, who reigned forty years.  For under
that judge who is called Ehud there were eighty years of peace. <span
id="fr_1078"></span>[1079](#fn_1078.md)   Be it far from us, therefore,
that we should believe the times of Solomon are predicted in this
promise, much less indeed those of any other king whatever.  For none
other of them reigned in such great peace as he; nor did that nation
ever at all hold that kingdom so as to have no anxiety lest it should be
subdued by enemies:  for in the very great mutability of human affairs
such great security is never given to any people, that it should not
dread invasions hostile to this life.  Therefore the place of this
promised peaceful and secure habitation is eternal, and of right belongs
eternally to Jerusalem the free mother, where the genuine people of
Israel shall be:  for this name is interpreted “Seeing God;” in the
desire of which reward a pious life is to be led through faith in this
miserable pilgrimage. <span id="fr_1079"></span>[1080](#fn_1079.md)
