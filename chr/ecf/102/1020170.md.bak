<span id="iv.VI.1-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.VI.1-p1.1"></span>Chapter 1.—Of Those Who Maintain that They
Worship the Gods Not for the Sake of Temporal But Eternal
Advantages.</span>

<span id="iv.VI.1-p2"></span>Now, as, in the next place (as the promised
order demands), those are to be refuted and taught who contend that the
gods of the nations, which the Christian truth destroys, are to be
worshipped not on account of this life, but on account of that which is
to be after death, I shall do well to commence my disputation with the
truthful oracle of the holy psalm, “Blessed is the man whose hope is the
Lord God, and who respecteth not vanities and lying follies.” <span
id="fr_230"></span>[231](#fn_230.md)   Nevertheless, in all vanities and
lying follies the philosophers are to be listened to with far more
toleration, who have repudiated those opinions and errors of the people;
for the people set up images to the deities, and either feigned
concerning <span id="page_109">p. 109</span> <span
id="iv.VI.1-Page_109"></span> those whom they call immortal gods many
false and unworthy things, or believed them, already feigned, and, when
believed, mixed them up with their worship and sacred rites.

<span id="iv.VI.1-p4"></span>With those men who, though not by free
avowal of their convictions, do still testify that they disapprove of
those things by their muttering disapprobation during disputations on
the subject, it may not be very far amiss to discuss the following
question:  Whether for the sake of the life which is to be after death,
we ought to worship, not the one God who made all creatures spiritual
and corporeal, but those many gods who, as some of these philosophers
hold, were made by that one God, and placed by Him in their respective
sublime spheres, and are therefore considered more excellent and more
noble than all the others? <span id="fr_231"></span>[232](#fn_231.md)   But
who will assert that it must be affirmed and contended that those gods,
certain of whom I have mentioned in the fourth book, <span
id="fr_232"></span>[233](#fn_232.md) to whom are distributed, each to each,
the charges of minute things, do bestow eternal life?  But will those
most skilled and most acute men, who glory in having written for the
great benefit of men, to teach on what account each god is to be
worshipped, and what is to be sought from each, lest with most
disgraceful absurdity, such as a mimic is wont for the sake of merriment
to exhibit, water should be sought from Liber, wine from the
Lymphs,—will those men indeed affirm to any man supplicating the
immortal gods, that when he shall have asked wine from the Lymphs, and
they shall have answered him, “We have water, seek wine from Liber,” he
may rightly say, “If ye have not wine, at least give me eternal life?” 
What more monstrous than this absurdity?  Will not these Lymphs,—for
they are wont to be very easily made laugh, <span
id="fr_233"></span>[234](#fn_233.md) —laughing loudly (if they do not
attempt to deceive like demons), answer the suppliant, “O man, dost thou
think that we have life (*vitam*) in our power, who thou hearest have
not even the vine (*vitem*)?”  It is therefore most impudent folly to
seek and hope for eternal life from such gods as are asserted so to
preside over the separate minute concernments of this most sorrowful and
short life, and whatever is useful for supporting and propping it, as
that if anything which is under the care and power of one be sought from
another, it is so incongruous and absurd that it appears very like to
mimic drollery,—which, when it is done by mimics knowing what they are
doing, is deservedly laughed at in the theatre, but when it is done by
foolish persons, who do not know better, is more deservedly ridiculed in
the world.  Wherefore, as concerns those gods which the states have
established, it has been cleverly invented and handed down to memory by
learned men, what god or goddess is to be supplicated in relation to
every particular thing,—what, for instance, is to be sought from Liber,
what from the Lymphs, what from Vulcan, and so of all the rest, some of
whom I have mentioned in the fourth book, and some I have thought right
to omit.  Further, if it is an error to seek wine from Ceres, bread from
Liber, water from Vulcan, fire from the Lymphs, how much greater
absurdity ought it to be thought, if supplication be made to any one of
these for eternal life?

<span id="iv.VI.1-p8"></span>Wherefore, if, when we were inquiring what
gods or goddesses are to be believed to be able to confer earthly
kingdoms upon men, all things having been discussed, it was shown to be
very far from the truth to think that even terrestrial kingdoms are
established by any of those many false deities, is it not most insane
impiety to believe that eternal life, which is, without any doubt or
comparison, to be preferred to all terrestrial kingdoms, can be given to
any one by any of these gods?  For the reason why such gods seemed to us
not to be able to give even an earthly kingdom, was not because they are
very great and exalted, whilst that is something small and abject, which
they, in their so great sublimity, would not condescend to care for, but
because, however deservedly any one may, in consideration of human
frailty, despise the falling pinnacles of an earthly kingdom, these gods
have presented such an appearance as to seem most unworthy to have the
granting and preserving of even those entrusted to them; and
consequently, if (as we have taught in the two last books of our work,
where this matter is treated of) no god out of all that crowd, either
belonging to, as it were, the plebeian or to the noble gods, is fit to
give mortal kingdoms to mortals, how much less is he able to make
immortals of mortals?

<span id="iv.VI.1-p9"></span>And more than this, if, according to the
opinion of those with whom we are now arguing, the gods are to be
worshipped, not on account of the present life, but of that which is to
be after death, then, certainly, they are not to be worshipped on
account of those particular things which are distributed and portioned
out (not by any law of rational truth, but by mere vain conjecture) to
the power of such gods, as they believe they ought to be worshipped, who
contend that their worship is necessary for all the desirable things of
this mortal life, against whom I have disputed sufficiently, as far as I
was able, in the five <span id="page_110">p. 110</span> <span
id="iv.VI.1-Page_110"></span> preceding books.  These things being so,
if the age itself of those who worshipped the goddess Juventas should be
characterized by remarkable vigor, whilst her despisers should either
die within the years of youth, or should, during that period, grow cold
as with the torpor of old age; if bearded Fortuna should cover the
cheeks of her worshippers more handsomely and more gracefully than all
others, whilst we should see those by whom she was despised either
altogether beardless or ill-bearded; even then we should most rightly
say, that thus far these several gods had power, limited in some way by
their functions, and that, consequently, neither ought eternal life to
be sought from Juventas, who could not give a beard, nor ought any good
thing after this life to be expected from Fortuna Barbata, who has no
power even in this life to give the age itself at which the beard
grows.  But now, when their worship is necessary not even on account of
those very things which they think are subjected to their power,—for
many worshippers of the goddess Juventas have not been at all vigorous
at that age, and many who do not worship her rejoice in youthful
strength; and also many suppliants of Fortuna Barbata have either not
been able to attain to any beard at all, not even an ugly one, although
they who adore her in order to obtain a beard are ridiculed by her
bearded despisers,—is the human heart really so foolish as to believe
that that worship of the gods, which it acknowledges to be vain and
ridiculous with respect to those very temporal and swiftly passing
gifts, over each of which one of these gods is said to preside, is
fruitful in results with respect to eternal life?  And that they are
able to give eternal life has not been affirmed even by those who, that
they might be worshipped by the silly populace, distributed in minute
division among them these temporal occupations, that none of them might
sit idle; for they had supposed the existence of an exceedingly great
number.
