<span id="v.vi.xviii-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="v.vi.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 18.—We Must Take into Consideration
the Time at Which Anything Was Enjoyed or Allowed.</span>

<span id="v.vi.xviii-p2"></span>26.  We must also be on our guard
against supposing that what in the Old Testament, making allowance for
the condition of those times, is not a crime or a vice even if we take
it literally and not figuratively, can be transferred to the present
time as a habit of life.  For no one will do this except lust has
dominion over him, and endeavors to find support for itself in the very
Scriptures which were intended to overthrow it.  And the wretched man
does not perceive that such matters are recorded with this useful
design, that men of good hope may learn the salutary lesson, both that
the custom they spurn can be turned to a good use, and that which they
embrace can be used to condemnation, if the use of the former be
accompanied with charity, and the use of the latter with lust.

<span id="v.vi.xviii-p3"></span>27.  For, if it was possible for one man
to use many wives with chastity, it is possible for another to use one
wife with lust.  And I look with greater approval on the man who uses
the fruitfulness of many wives for the sake of an ulterior object, than
on the man who enjoys the body of one wife for its own sake.  For in the
former case the man aims at a useful object suited to the circumstances
of the times; in the latter case he gratifies a lust which is engrossed
in temporal enjoyments.  And those men to whom the apostle permitted as
a matter of indulgence to have one wife because of their
incontinence, <span id="fr_1871"></span>[1872](#fn_1871.md) were less near
to God than those who, though they had each of them numerous wives, yet
just as a wise man uses food and drink only for the sake of bodily
health, used marriage only for the sake of offspring.  And, accordingly,
if these last had been still alive at the advent of our Lord, when the
time not of casting stones away but of gathering them together had
come, <span id="fr_1872"></span>[1873](#fn_1872.md) they would have
immediately made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven’s sake. 
For there is no difficulty in abstaining unless when there is lust in
enjoying.  And assuredly those men of whom I speak knew that wantonness
even in regard to wives is abuse and intemperance, as is proved by
Tobit’s prayer when he was married to his wife.  For he says:  “Blessed
art Thou, O God of our fathers, and blessed is Thy holy and glorious
name for ever; let the heavens bless Thee, and all Thy creatures.  Thou
madest Adam, and gavest him Eve his wife for an helper and stay. . . .
And now, O Lord, Thou knowest that I take not this my sister for lust,
but uprightly:  therefore have pity on us, O Lord.” <span
