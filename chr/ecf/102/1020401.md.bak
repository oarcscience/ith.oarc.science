<span id="iv.XIV.9-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XIV.9-p1.1"></span>Chapter 9.—Of the Perturbations of the Soul
Which Appear as Right Affections in the Life of the Righteous.</span>

<span id="iv.XIV.9-p2"></span>But so far as regards this question of
mental perturbations, we have answered these philosophers in the ninth
book <span id="fr_686"></span>[687](#fn_686.md) of this work, showing that
it is rather a verbal than a real dispute, and that they seek contention
rather than truth.  Among ourselves, according to the sacred Scriptures
and sound doctrine, the citizens of the holy city of God, who live
according to God in the pilgrimage of this life, both fear and desire,
and grieve and rejoice.  And because their love is rightly placed, all
these affections of theirs are right.  They fear eternal punishment,
they desire eternal life; they grieve because they themselves groan
within themselves, waiting for the adoption, the redemption of their
body; <span id="fr_687"></span>[688](#fn_687.md) they rejoice in hope,
because there “shall be brought to pass the saying that is written,
Death is <span id="page_269">p. 269</span> <span
id="iv.XIV.9-Page_269"></span> swallowed up in victory.” <span
id="fr_688"></span>[689](#fn_688.md)   In like manner they fear to sin,
they desire to persevere; they grieve in sin, they rejoice in good
works.  They fear to sin, because they hear that “because iniquity shall
abound, the love of many shall wax cold.” <span
id="fr_689"></span>[690](#fn_689.md)   They desire to persevere, because
they hear that it is written, “He that endureth to the end shall be
saved.” <span id="fr_690"></span>[691](#fn_690.md)   They grieve for sin,
hearing that “If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and
the truth is not in us.” <span id="fr_691"></span>[692](#fn_691.md)   They
rejoice in good works, because they hear that “the Lord loveth a
cheerful giver.” <span id="fr_692"></span>[693](#fn_692.md)   In like
manner, according as they are strong or weak, they fear or desire to be
tempted, grieve or rejoice in temptation.  They fear to be tempted,
because they hear the injunction, “If a man be overtaken in a fault, ye
which are spiritual restore such an one in the spirit of meekness;
considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.” <span
id="fr_693"></span>[694](#fn_693.md)   They desire to be tempted, because
they hear one of the heroes of the city of God saying, “Examine me, O
Lord, and tempt me:  try my reins and my heart.” <span
id="fr_694"></span>[695](#fn_694.md)   They grieve in temptations, because
they see Peter weeping; <span id="fr_695"></span>[696](#fn_695.md) they
rejoice in temptations, because they hear James saying, “My brethren,
count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations.” <span
id="fr_696"></span>[697](#fn_696.md)

<span id="iv.XIV.9-p14"></span>And not only on their own account do they
experience these emotions, but also on account of those whose
deliverance they desire and whose perdition they fear, and whose loss or
salvation affects them with grief or with joy.  For if we who have come
into the Church from among the Gentiles may suitably instance that noble
and mighty hero who glories in his infirmities, the teacher (*doctor*)
of the nations in faith and truth, who also labored more than all his
fellow-apostles, and instructed the tribes of God’s people by his
epistles, which edified not only those of his own time, but all those
who were to be gathered in,—that hero, I say, and athlete of Christ,
instructed by Him, anointed of His Spirit, crucified with Him, glorious
in Him, lawfully maintaining a great conflict on the theatre of this
world, and being made a spectacle to angels and men, <span
id="fr_697"></span>[698](#fn_697.md) and pressing onwards for the prize of
his high calling, <span id="fr_698"></span>[699](#fn_698.md) —very joyfully
do we with the eyes of faith behold him rejoicing with them that
rejoice, and weeping with them that weep; <span
id="fr_699"></span>[700](#fn_699.md) though hampered by fightings without
and fears within; <span id="fr_700"></span>[701](#fn_700.md) desiring to
depart and to be with Christ; <span id="fr_701"></span>[702](#fn_701.md)
longing to see the Romans, that he might have some fruit among them as
among other Gentiles; <span id="fr_702"></span>[703](#fn_702.md) being
jealous over the Corinthians, and fearing in that jealousy lest their
minds should be corrupted from the chastity that is in Christ; <span
id="fr_703"></span>[704](#fn_703.md) having great heaviness and continual
sorrow of heart for the Israelites, <span
id="fr_704"></span>[705](#fn_704.md) because they, being ignorant of God’s
righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness,
have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God; <span
id="fr_705"></span>[706](#fn_705.md) and expressing not only his sorrow,
but bitter lamentation over some who had formally sinned and had not
repented of their uncleanness and fornications. <span
id="fr_706"></span>[707](#fn_706.md)

<span id="iv.XIV.9-p25"></span>If these emotions and affections, arising
as they do from the love of what is good and from a holy charity, are to
be called vices, then let us allow these emotions which are truly vices
to pass under the name of virtues.  But since these affections, when
they are exercised in a becoming way, follow the guidance of right
reason, who will dare to say that they are diseases or vicious
passions?  Wherefore even the Lord Himself, when He condescended to lead
a human life in the form of a slave, had no sin whatever, and yet
exercised these emotions where He judged they should be exercised.  For
as there was in Him a true human body and a true human soul, so was
there also a true human emotion.  When, therefore, we read in the Gospel
that the hard-heartedness of the Jews moved Him to sorrowful
indignation, <span id="fr_707"></span>[708](#fn_707.md) that He said, “I am
glad for your sakes, to the intent ye may believe,” <span
id="fr_708"></span>[709](#fn_708.md) that when about to raise Lazarus He
even shed tears, <span id="fr_709"></span>[710](#fn_709.md) that He
earnestly desired to eat the passover with His disciples, <span
id="fr_710"></span>[711](#fn_710.md) that as His passion drew near His soul
was sorrowful, <span id="fr_711"></span>[712](#fn_711.md) these emotions
are certainly not falsely ascribed to Him.  But as He became man when it
pleased Him, so, in the grace of His definite purpose, when it pleased
Him He experienced those emotions in His human soul.

<span id="iv.XIV.9-p31"></span>But we must further make the admission,
that even when these affections are well regulated, and according to
God’s will, they are peculiar to this life, not to that future life we
look for, and that often we yield to them against our will.  And thus
sometimes we weep in spite of ourselves, being carried beyond ourselves,
not indeed by culpable desire; but by praiseworthy charity.  In us,
therefore, these affections arise from human infirmity; but it was not
so with the Lord Jesus, for even His infirmity was the consequence of
His power.  But so long as we wear the infirmity of this life, we are
rather worse men <span id="page_270">p. 270</span> <span
id="iv.XIV.9-Page_270"></span> than better if we have none of these
emotions at all.  For the apostle vituperated and abominated some who,
as he said, were “without natural affection.” <span
id="fr_712"></span>[713](#fn_712.md)   The sacred Psalmist also found fault
with those of whom he said, “I looked for some to lament with me, and
there was none.” <span id="fr_713"></span>[714](#fn_713.md)   For to be
quite free from pain while we are in this place of misery is only
purchased, as one of this world’s literati perceived and remarked, <span
id="fr_714"></span>[715](#fn_714.md) at the price of blunted sensibilities
both of mind and body.  And therefore that which the Greeks call <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.XIV.9-p34.1"></span>ἀπαθεια</span>, and what
the Latins would call, if their language would allow them,
“*impassibilitas*,” if it be taken to mean an impassibility of spirit
and not of body, or, in other words, a freedom from those emotions which
are contrary to reason and disturb the mind, then it is obviously a good
and most desirable quality, but it is not one which is attainable in
this life.  For the words of the apostle are the confession, not of the
common herd, but of the eminently pious, just, and holy men:  “If we say
we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.” <span
id="fr_715"></span>[716](#fn_715.md)   When there shall be no sin in a man,
then there shall be this <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.XIV.9-p35.2"></span>απάθεια</span>.  At present it is enough if
we live without crime; and he who thinks he lives without sin puts aside
not sin, but pardon.  And if that is to be called apathy, where the mind
is the subject of no emotion, then who would not consider this
insensibility to be worse than all vices?  It may, indeed, reasonably be
maintained that the perfect blessedness we hope for shall be free from
all sting of fear or sadness; but who that is not quite lost to truth
would say that neither love nor joy shall be experienced there?  But if
by apathy a condition be meant in which no fear terrifies nor any pain
annoys, we must in this life renounce such a state if we would live
according to God’s will, but may hope to enjoy it in that blessedness
which is promised as our eternal condition.

<span id="iv.XIV.9-p36"></span>For that fear of which the Apostle John
says, “There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear,
because fear hath torment.  He that feareth is not made perfect in
love,” <span id="fr_716"></span>[717](#fn_716.md) —that fear is not of the
same kind as the Apostle Paul felt lest the Corinthians should be
seduced by the subtlety of the serpent; for love is susceptible of this
fear, yea, love alone is capable of it.  But the fear which is not in
love is of that kind of which Paul himself says, “For ye have not
received the spirit of bondage again to fear.” <span
id="fr_717"></span>[718](#fn_717.md)   But as for that “clean fear which
endureth for ever,” <span id="fr_718"></span>[719](#fn_718.md) if it is to
exist in the world to come (and how else can it be said to endure for
ever?), it is not a fear deterring us from evil which may happen, but
preserving us in the good which cannot be lost.  For where the love of
acquired good is unchangeable, there certainly the fear that avoids evil
is, if I may say so, free from anxiety.  For under the name of “clean
fear” David signifies that will by which we shall necessarily shrink
from sin, and guard against it, not with the anxiety of weakness, which
fears that we may strongly sin, but with the tranquillity of perfect
love.  Or if no kind of fear at all shall exist in that most
imperturbable security of perpetual and blissful delights, then the
expression, “The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring for ever,” must be
taken in the same sense as that other, “The patience of the poor shall
not perish for ever.” <span id="fr_719"></span>[720](#fn_719.md)   For
patience, which is necessary only where ills are to be borne, shall not
be eternal, but that which patience leads us to will be eternal.  So
perhaps this “clean fear” is said to endure for ever, because that to
which fear leads shall endure.

<span id="iv.XIV.9-p41"></span>And since this is so,—since we must live
a good life in order to attain to a blessed life, a good life has all
these affections right, a bad life has them wrong.  But in the blessed
life eternal there will be love and joy, not only right, but also
assured; but fear and grief there will be none.  Whence it already
appears in some sort what manner of persons the citizens of the city of
God must be in this their pilgrimage, who live after the spirit, not
after the flesh,—that is to say, according to God, not according to
man,—and what manner of persons they shall be also in that immortality
whither they are journeying.  And the city or society of the wicked, who
live not according to God, but according to man, and who accept the
doctrines of men or devils in the worship of a false and contempt of the
true divinity, is shaken with those wicked emotions as by diseases and
disturbances.  And if there be some of its citizens who seem to restrain
and, as it were, temper those passions, they are so elated with ungodly
pride, that their disease is as much greater as their pain is less.  And
if some, with a vanity monstrous in proportion to its rarity, have
become enamored of themselves because they can be stimulated and excited
by no emotion, moved or bent by no affection, such persons rather lose
all humanity than obtain true tranquillity.  For <span id="page_271">p.
271</span> <span id="iv.XIV.9-Page_271"></span> a thing is not
necessarily right because it is inflexible, nor healthy because it is
insensible.
