<span id="iv.X.2-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.X.2-p1.1"></span>Chapter 2.—The Opinion of Plotinus the Platonist
Regarding Enlightenment from Above.</span>

<span id="iv.X.2-p2"></span>But with these more estimable philosophers
we have no dispute in this matter.  For they perceived, and in various
forms abundantly expressed in their writings, that these spirits have
the same source of happiness as ourselves,—a certain intelligible light,
which is their God, and is different from themselves, and illumines them
that they may be penetrated with light, and enjoy perfect happiness in
the participation of God.  Plotinus, commenting on Plato, repeatedly and
strongly asserts that not even the soul which they believe to be the
soul of the world, derives its blessedness from any other source than we
do, viz., from that Light which is distinct from it and created it, and
by whose intelligible illumination it enjoys light in things
intelligible.  He also compares those spiritual things to the vast and
conspicuous heavenly bodies, as if God were the sun, and the soul the
moon; for they suppose that the moon derives its light from the sun. 
That great Platonist, therefore, says that the rational soul, or rather
the intellectual soul,—in which class he comprehends the souls of the
blessed immortals who inhabit heaven,—has no nature superior to it save
God, the Creator of the world and the soul itself, and that these
heavenly spirits derive their blessed life, and the light of truth from
their blessed life, and the light of truth, the source as ourselves,
agreeing with the gospel where we read, “There was a man sent from God
whose name was John; the same came for a witness to bear witness of that
Light, that through Him all might believe.  He was not that Light, but
that he might bear witness of the Light.  That was the true Light which
lighteth every man that <span id="page_182">p. 182</span> <span
id="iv.X.2-Page_182"></span> cometh into the world;” <span
id="fr_375"></span>[376](#fn_375.md) a distinction which sufficiently
proves that the rational or intellectual soul such as John had cannot be
its own light, but needs to receive illumination from another, the true
Light.  This John himself avows when he delivers his witness:  “We have
all received of His fullness.” <span id="fr_376"></span>[377](#fn_376.md)
