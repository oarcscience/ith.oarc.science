id="iv.XIV.17-p1.1"></span>Chapter 17.—Of the Nakedness of Our First
Parents, Which They Saw After Their Base and Shameful Sin.</span>

<span id="iv.XIV.17-p2"></span>Justly is shame very specially connected
with this lust; justly, too, these members themselves, being moved and
restrained not at our will, but by a certain independent autocracy, so
to speak, are called “shameful.”  Their condition was different before
sin.  For as it is written, “They were naked and were not
ashamed,” <span id="fr_741"></span>[742](#fn_741) —not that their
nakedness was unknown to them, but because nakedness was not yet
shameful, because not yet did lust move those members without the will’s
consent; not yet did the flesh by its disobedience testify against the
disobedience of man.  For they were not created blind, as the
unenlightened vulgar fancy; <span id="fr_742"></span>[743](#fn_742) for
Adam saw the animals to whom he gave names, and of Eve we read, “The
woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to
the eyes.” <span id="fr_743"></span>[744](#fn_743)   Their eyes,
therefore were open, but were not open to this, that is to say, were not
observant so as to recognize what was conferred upon them by the garment
of grace, for they had no consciousness of their members warring against
their will.  But when they were stripped of this grace, <span
id="fr_744"></span>[745](#fn_744) that their disobedience might be
punished by fit retribution, there began in the movement of their bodily
members a shameless novelty which made nakedness indecent:  it at once
made them observant and made them ashamed.  And therefore, after they
violated God’s command by open transgression, it is written:  “And the
eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and
they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.” <span
id="fr_745"></span>[746](#fn_745)   “The eyes of them both were opened,”
not to see, for already they saw, but to discern between the good they
had lost and the evil into which they had fallen.  And therefore also
the tree itself which they were forbidden to touch was called the tree
of the knowledge of good and evil from this circumstance, that if they
ate of it it would impart to them this knowledge.  For the discomfort of
sickness reveals the pleasure of health.  “They knew,” therefore, “that
they were naked,”—naked of that grace which prevented them from being
ashamed of bodily nakedness while the law of sin offered no resistance
to their mind.  And thus they obtained a knowledge which they would have
lived in blissful ignorance of, had they, in trustful obedience to God,
declined to commit that offence which involved them in the experience of
the hurtful effects of unfaithfulness and disobedience.  And therefore,
being ashamed of the disobedience of their own flesh, which witnessed to
their disobedience while it punished it, “they sewed fig leaves
together, and made themselves aprons,” that is, cinctures for their
privy parts; for some interpreters have rendered the word by
*succinctoria*.  *Campestria* is, indeed, a Latin word, but it is used
of the drawers or aprons used for a similar purpose by the young men who
stripped for exercise in the *campus*; hence those who were so girt were
commonly called *campestrati*.  Shame modestly covered that which lust
disobediently moved in opposition to the will, which was thus punished
for its own disobedience.  Consequently all nations, being propagated
from that one stock, have so strong an instinct to cover the shameful
parts, that some barbarians do not uncover them even in the bath, but
wash with their drawers on.  In the dark solitudes of India also, though
some philosophers go naked, and are therefore called gymnosophists, yet
they make an exception in the case of these members and cover them.
