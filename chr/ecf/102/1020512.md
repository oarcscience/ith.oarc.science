<span id="iv.XVII.19-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XVII.19-p1.1"></span>Chapter 19.—Of the 69th Psalm, in Which the
Obstinate Unbelief of the Jews is Declared.</span>

<span id="iv.XVII.19-p2"></span>But when the Jews will not in the least
yield to the testimonies of this prophecy, which are so manifest, and
are also brought by events to so clear and certain a completion,
certainly that is fulfilled in them which is written in that psalm which
here follows.  For when the things which pertain to His passion are
prophetically spoken there also in the person of Christ, that is
mentioned which is unfolded in the Gospel:  “They gave me gall for my
meat; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar for drink.” <span
id="fr_1109"></span>[1110](#fn_1109)   And as it were after such a feast
and dainties in this way given to Himself, presently He brings in
\[these words\]:  “Let their table become a trap before them, and a
retribution, and an offence:  let their eyes be dimmed that they see
not, and their back be always bowed down,” <span
id="fr_1110"></span>[1111](#fn_1110) etc.  Which things are <span
id="page_357">p. 357</span> <span id="iv.XVII.19-Page_357"></span> not
spoken as wished for, but are predicted under the prophetic form of
wishing.  What wonder, then, if those whose eyes are dimmed that they
see not do not see these manifest things?  What wonder if those do not
look up at heavenly things whose back is always bowed down that they may
grovel among earthly things?  For these words transferred from the body
signify mental faults.  Let these things which have been said about the
Psalms, that is, about king David’s prophecy, suffice, that we may keep
within some bound.  But let those readers excuse us who knew them all
before; and let them not complain about those perhaps stronger proofs
which they know or think I have passed by.
