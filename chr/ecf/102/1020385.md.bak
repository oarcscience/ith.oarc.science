id="iv.XIII.18-p1.1"></span>Chapter 18.—Of Earthly Bodies, Which the
Philosophers Affirm Cannot Be in Heavenly Places, Because Whatever is of
Earth is by Its Natural Weight Attracted to Earth.</span>

<span id="iv.XIII.18-p2"></span>But it is necessary, they say, that the
natural weight of earthly bodies either keeps them on earth or draws
them to it; and therefore they cannot be in heaven.  Our first parents
were indeed on earth, in a well-wooded and fruitful spot, which has been
named Paradise.  But let our adversaries a little more carefully
consider this subject of earthly weight, because it has important
bearings, both on the ascension of the body of Christ, and also on the
resurrection body of the saints.  If human skill can by some contrivance
fabricate vessels that float, out of metals which sink as soon as they
are placed on the water, how much more credible is it that God, by some
occult mode of operation, should even more certainly effect that these
earthy masses be emancipated from the downward pressure of their
weight?  This cannot be impossible to that God by whose almighty will,
according to Plato, neither things born perish, nor things composed
dissolve, especially since it is much more wonderful that spiritual and
bodily essences be conjoined than that bodies be adjusted to other
material substances.  Can we not also easily believe that souls, being
made perfectly blessed, should be endowed with the power of moving their
earthy but incorruptible bodies as they please, with almost spontaneous
movement, and of placing them where they please with the readiest
action?  If the angels transport whatever terrestrial creatures they
please from any place they please, and convey them whither they please,
is it to be believed that they cannot do so without toil and the feeling
of burden?  Why, then, may we not believe that the spirits of the
saints, made perfect and blessed by divine grace, can carry their own
bodies where they please, and set them where they will?  For, though we
have been accustomed to notice, in bearing weights, that the larger the
quantity the greater the weight of earthy bodies is, and that the
greater the weight the more burdensome it is, yet the soul carries the
members of its own flesh with less difficulty when they are massive with
health, than in sickness when they are wasted.  And though the hale and
strong man feels heavier to other men carrying him than the lank and
sickly, yet the man himself moves and carries his own body with less
feeling of burden when he has the greater bulk of vigorous health, than
when his frame is reduced to a minimum by hunger or disease.  Of such
consequence, in estimating the weight of earthly bodies, even while yet
corruptible and mortal, is the consideration not of dead weight, but of
the healthy equilibrium of the parts.  And what words can tell the
difference between what we now call health and future immortality?  Let
not the philosophers, then, think to upset our faith with arguments from
the weight of bodies; for I don’t care to inquire why they cannot
believe an earthly body can be in heaven, while the whole earth is
suspended on nothing.  For perhaps the world keeps its central place by
the same law that attracts to its centre all heavy bodies.  But this I
say, if the lesser gods, to whom Plato committed the creation of man and
the other terrestrial creatures, were able, as he affirms, to withdraw
from the fire its quality of burning, while they left it that of
lighting, so that it should shine through the eyes; and if to the
supreme God Plato also concedes the power of preserving from death
things that have been born, and of preserving from dissolution things
that are composed of parts so different as body and spirit;—are we to
hesitate to concede to this same God the power to operate on the flesh
of him whom He has endowed with immortality, so as to withdraw its
corruption but leave its nature, remove its burdensome weight but retain
its seemly form and members?  But concerning our belief in the
resurrection of the dead, and concerning their immortal bodies, we shall
speak more at large, God willing, in the end of this work.
