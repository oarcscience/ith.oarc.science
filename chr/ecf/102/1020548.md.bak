<span id="iv.XVIII.30-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XVIII.30-p1.1"></span>Chapter 30.—What Micah, Jonah, and Joel
Prophesied in Accordance with the New Testament.</span>

<span id="iv.XVIII.30-p2"></span>The prophet Micah, representing Christ
under the figure of a great mountain, speaks thus:  “It shall come to
pass in the last days, that the manifested mountain of the Lord shall be
prepared on the tops of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the
hills; and people shall hasten unto it.  Many nations shall go, and
shall say, Come, let us go up into the mountain of the Lord, and into
the house of the God of Jacob; and He will show us His way, and we will
go in His paths:  for out of Zion shall proceed the law, and the word of
the Lord out of Jerusalem.  And He shall judge among many people, and
rebuke strong nations afar off.” <span
id="fr_1164"></span>[1165](#fn_1164.md)   This prophet predicts the very
place in which Christ was born, saying, “And thou, Bethlehem, of the
house of Ephratah, art the least that can be reckoned among the
thousands of Judah; out of thee shall come forth unto me a leader, to be
the prince in Israel; and His going forth is from the beginning, even
from the days of eternity.  Therefore will He give them \[up\] even
until the time when she that travaileth shall bring forth; and the
remnant of His brethren shall be converted to the sons of Israel.  And
He shall stand, and see, and feed His flock in the strength of the Lord,
and in the dignity of the name of the Lord His God:  for now shall He be
magnified even to the utmost of the earth.” <span
id="fr_1165"></span>[1166](#fn_1165.md)

<span id="iv.XVIII.30-p5"></span>The prophet Jonah, not so much by
speech as by his own painful experience, prophesied Christ’s death and
resurrection much more clearly than if he had proclaimed them with his
voice.  For why was he taken into the whale’s belly and restored on the
third day, but that he might be a sign that Christ should return from
the depths of hell on the third day?

<span id="iv.XVIII.30-p6"></span>I should be obliged to use many words
in explaining all that Joel prophesies in order to make clear those that
pertain to Christ and the Church.  But there is one passage I must not
pass by, which the apostles also quoted when the Holy Spirit came down
from above on the assembled believers according to <span
id="page_377">p. 377</span> <span id="iv.XVIII.30-Page_377"></span>
Christ’s promise.  He says, “And it shall come to pass after these
things, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and
your daughters shall prophesy, and your old men shall dream, and your
young men shall see visions:  and even on my servants and mine handmaids
in those days will I pour out my Spirit.” <span
