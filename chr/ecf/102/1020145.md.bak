<span id="iv.V.4-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.V.4-p1.1"></span>Chapter 4.—Concerning the Twins Esau and Jacob,
Who Were Very Unlike Each Other Both in Their Character and
Actions.</span>

<span id="iv.V.4-p2"></span>In the time of the ancient fathers, to speak
concerning illustrious persons, there were born two twin brothers, the
one so immediately after the other, that the first took hold of the heel
of the second.  So great a difference existed in their lives and
manners, so great a dissimilarity in their actions, so great a
difference in their parents’ love for them respectively, that the very
contrast between them produced even a mutual hostile antipathy.  Do we
mean, when we say that they were so unlike each other, that when the one
was walking the other was sitting, when the one was sleeping the other
was waking,—which differences are such as are attributed to those minute
portions of space which cannot be appreciated by those who note down the
position of the stars which exists at the moment of one’s birth, in
order that the mathematicians may be consulted concerning it?  One of
these twins was for a long time a hired servant; the other never
served.  One of them was beloved by his mother; the other was not so. 
One of them lost that honor which was so much valued among their people;
the other obtained it.  And what shall we say of their wives, their
children, and their possessions?  How different they were in respect to
all these!  If, therefore, such things as these are connected with those
minute intervals of time which elapse between the births of twins, and
are not to be attributed to the constellations, wherefore are they
predicted in the case of <span id="page_87">p. 87</span> <span
id="iv.V.4-Page_87"></span> others from the examination of their
constellations?  And if, on the other hand, these things are said to be
predicted, because they are connected, not with minute and inappreciable
moments, but with intervals of time which can be observed and noted
down, what purpose is that potter’s wheel to serve in this matter,
except it be to whirl round men who have hearts of clay, in order that
they may be prevented from detecting the emptiness of the talk of the
mathematicians?
