<span id="iv.XVI.12-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XVI.12-p1.1"></span>Chapter 12.—Of the Era in Abraham’s Life from
Which a New Period in the Holy Succession Begins.</span>

<span id="iv.XVI.12-p2"></span>Let us now survey the progress of the
city of God from the era of the patriarch Abraham, from whose time it
begins to be more conspicuous, and the divine promises which are now
fulfilled in Christ are more fully revealed.  We learn, then, from the
intimations of holy Scripture, that Abraham was born in the country of
the Chaldeans, a land belonging to the Assyrian empire.  Now, even at
that time impious superstitions were rife with the Chaldeans, as with
other nations.  The family of Terah, to which Abraham belonged, was the
only one in which the worship of the true God survived, and the only
one, we may suppose, in which the Hebrew language was preserved;
although Joshua the son of Nun tells us that even this family served
other gods in Mesopotamia. <span id="fr_887"></span>[888](#fn_887.md)   The
other descendants of Heber gradually became absorbed in other races and
other languages.  And thus, as the single family of Noah was preserved
through the deluge of water to renew the human race, so, in the deluge
of superstition that flooded the whole world, there remained but the one
family of Terah in which the seed of God’s city was preserved.  And as,
when Scripture has enumerated the generations prior to Noah, with their
ages, and explained the cause of the flood before God began to speak to
Noah about the building of the ark, it is said, “These are the
generations of Noah;” so also now, after enumerating the generations
from Shem, Noah’s son, down to Abraham, it then signalizes an era by
saying, “These are the generations of Terah:  Terah begat Abram, Nahor,
and Haran; and Haran begat Lot.  And Haran died before his father Terah
in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.  And Abram and Nahor
took them wives:  the name of Abram’s wife was Sarai; and the name of
Nahor’s wife Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and
the father of Iscah.” <span id="fr_888"></span>[889](#fn_888.md)   This
Iscah is supposed to be the same as Sarah, Abraham’s wife.
