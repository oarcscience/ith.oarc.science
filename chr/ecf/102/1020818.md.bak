work, that which treats of expression, the author premises that it is no
part of his intention to write a treatise on the laws of rhetoric. 
These can be learned elsewhere, and ought not to be neglected, being
indeed specially necessary for the Christian teacher, whom it behoves to
excel in eloquence and power of speech.  After detailing with much care
and minuteness the various qualities of an orator, he recommends the
authors of the Holy Scriptures as the best models of eloquence, far
excelling all others in the combination of eloquence with wisdom.  He
points out that perspicuity is the most essential quality of style, and
ought to be cultivated with especial care by the teacher, as it is the
main requisite for instruction, although other qualities are required
for delighting and persuading the hearer.  All these gifts are to be
sought in earnest prayer from God, though we are not to forget to be
zealous and diligent in study.  He shows that there are three species of
style, the subdued, the elegant, and the majestic; the first serving for
instruction, the second for praise, and the third for exhortation:  and
of each of these he gives examples, selected both from scripture and
from early teachers of the church, Cyprian and Ambrose.  He shows that
these various styles may be mingled, and when and for what purposes they
are mingled; and that they all have the same end in view, to bring home
the truth to the hearer, so that he may understand it, hear it with
gladness, and practise it in his life.  Finally, he exhorts the
Christian teacher himself, pointing out the dignity and responsibility
of the office he holds to lead a life in harmony with his own teaching,
and to show a good example to all.
