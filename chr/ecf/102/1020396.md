<span id="iv.XIV.4-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XIV.4-p1.1"></span>Chapter 4.—What It is to Live According to
Man, and What to Live According to God.</span>

<span id="iv.XIV.4-p2"></span>When, therefore, man lives according to
man, not according to God, he is like the devil.  Because not even an
angel might live according to an angel, but only according to God, if he
was to abide in the truth, and speak God’s truth and not his own lie. 
And of man, too, the same apostle says in another place, “If the truth
of God hath more abounded through my lie;” <span
id="fr_651"></span>[652](#fn_651) —“my lie,” he said, and “God’s
truth.”  When, then, a man lives according to the truth, he lives not
according to himself, but according to God; for He was God who said, “I
am the truth.” <span id="fr_652"></span>[653](#fn_652)   When,
therefore, man lives according to himself,—that is, according to man,
not according to God,—assuredly he lives according to a lie; not that
man himself is a lie, for God is his author and creator, who is
certainly not the author and creator of a lie, but because man was made
upright, that he might not live according to himself, but according to
Him that made him,—in other words, that he might do His will and not his
own; and not to live as he was made to live, that is a lie.  For he
certainly desires to be blessed even by not living so that he may be
blessed.  And what is a lie if this desire be not?  Wherefore it is not
without meaning said that all sin is a lie.  For no sin is committed
save by that desire or will by which we desire that it be well with us,
and shrink from it being ill with us.  That, therefore, is a lie which
we do in order that it may be well with us, but which makes us more
miserable than we were.  And why is this, but because the source of
man’s happiness lies only in God, whom he abandons when he sins, and not
in himself, by living according to whom he sins?

<span id="iv.XIV.4-p5"></span>In enunciating this proposition of ours,
then, that because some live according to the flesh and others according
to the spirit, there have arisen two diverse and conflicting cities, we
might equally well have said, “because some live according to man,
others according to God.”  For Paul says very plainly to the
Corinthians, “For whereas there is among you envying and strife, are ye
not carnal, and walk according to man?” <span
id="fr_653"></span>[654](#fn_653)   So that to walk according to man and
to be carnal are the <span id="page_265">p. 265</span> <span
id="iv.XIV.4-Page_265"></span> same; for by *flesh*, that is, by a part
of man, man is meant.  For before he said that those same persons were
animal whom afterwards he calls carnal, saying, “For what man knoweth
the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the
things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.  Now we have
received not the spirit of this world, but the Spirit which is of God;
that we might know the things which are freely given to us of God. 
Which things also we speak, not in the words which man’s wisdom
teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things
with spiritual.  But the animal man perceiveth not the things of the
Spirit of God; for they are foolishness unto him.” <span
id="fr_654"></span>[655](#fn_654)   It is to men of this kind, then,
that is, to animal men, he shortly after says, “And I, brethren, could
not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal.” <span
id="fr_655"></span>[656](#fn_655)   And this is to be interpreted by the
same usage, a part being taken for the whole.  For both the soul and the
flesh, the component parts of man, can be used to signify the whole man;
and so the animal man and the carnal man are not two different things,
but one and the same thing, viz., man living according to man.  In the
same way it is nothing else than men that are meant either in the words,
“By the deeds of the law there shall no *flesh* be justified;” <span
id="fr_656"></span>[657](#fn_656) or in the words, “Seventy-five *souls*
went down into Egypt with Jacob.” <span
id="fr_657"></span>[658](#fn_657)   In the one passage, “no flesh”
signifies “no man;” and in the other, by “seventy-five souls”
seventy-five men are meant.  And the expression, “not in words which
man’s wisdom teacheth” might equally be “not in words which fleshly
wisdom teacheth;” and the expression, “ye walk according to man,” might
be “according to the flesh.”  And this is still more apparent in the
words which followed:  “For while one saith, I am of Paul, and another,
I am of Apollos, are ye not men?”  The same thing which he had before
expressed by “ye are animal,” “ye are carnal, he now expresses by “ye
are men;” that is, ye live according to man, not according to God, for
if you lived according to Him, you should be gods.
