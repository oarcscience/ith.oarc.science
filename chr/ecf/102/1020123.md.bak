id="iv.IV.18-p1.1"></span>Chapter 18.—With What Reason They Who Think
Felicity and Fortune Goddesses Have Distinguished Them.</span>

<span id="iv.IV.18-p2"></span>What shall we say, besides, of the idea
that Felicity also is a goddess?  She has received a temple; she has
merited an altar; suitable rites of worship are paid to her.  She alone,
then, should be worshipped.  For where she is present, what good thing
can be absent?  But what does a man wish, that he thinks Fortune also a
goddess and worships her?  Is felicity one thing, fortune another? 
Fortune, indeed, may be bad as well as good; but felicity, if it could
be bad, would not be felicity.  Certainly we ought to think all the gods
of either sex (if they also have sex) are only good.  This says Plato;
this say other philosophers; this say all estimable rulers of the
republic and the nations.  How is it, then, that the goddess Fortune is
sometimes good, sometimes bad?  Is it perhaps the case that when she is
bad she is not a goddess, but is suddenly changed into a malignant
demon?  How many Fortunes are there then?  Just as many as there are men
who are fortunate, that is, of good fortune.  But since there must also
be very many others who at the very same time are men of bad fortune,
could she, being one and the same Fortune, be at the same time both bad
and good—the one to these, the other to those?  She who is the goddess,
is she always good?  Then she herself is felicity.  Why, then, are two
names given her?  Yet this is tolerable; for it is customary that one
thing should be called by two names.  But why different temples,
different altars, different rituals?  There is a reason, say they,
because Felicity is she whom the good have by previous merit; but
fortune, which is termed good without any trial of merit, befalls both
good and bad men fortuitously, whence also she is named Fortune.  How,
therefore, is she good, who without any discernment comes—both to the
good and to the bad?  Why is she worshipped, who is thus blind, running
at random on any one whatever, so that for the most part she passes by
her worshippers, and cleaves to those who despise her?  Or if her
worshippers profit somewhat, so that they are seen by her and loved,
then she follows merit, and does not come fortuitously.  What, then,
becomes of that definition of fortune?  What becomes of the opinion that
she has received her very name from fortuitous events?  For it profits
one nothing to worship her if she is truly fortune.  But if she
distinguishes her worshippers, so that she may benefit them, she is not
fortune.  Or does, Jupiter send her too, whither he pleases?  Then let
him alone be worshipped; because Fortune is not able to resist him when
he commands her, and sends her where he pleases.  Or, at least, let the
bad worship her, who do not choose to have merit by which the goddess
Felicity might be invited.
