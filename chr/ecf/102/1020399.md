<span id="iv.XIV.7-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XIV.7-p1.1"></span>Chapter 7.—That the Words Love and Regard
(Amor and Dilectio) are in Scripture Used Indifferently of Good and Evil
Affection.</span>

<span id="iv.XIV.7-p2"></span>He who resolves to love God, and to love
his neighbor as himself, not according to man but according to God, is
on account of this love said to be of a good will; and this is in
Scripture more commonly called charity, but it is also, even in the same
books, called love.  For the apostle says that the man to be elected as
a ruler of the people must be a lover of good. <span
id="fr_661"></span>[662](#fn_661.md)   And when the Lord Himself had asked
Peter, “Hast thou a regard for me (*diligis*) more than these?” Peter
replied, “Lord, Thou knowest that I love (*amo*) Thee.”  And again a
second time the Lord asked not whether Peter loved (*amaret*) Him, but
whether he had a regard (*diligeret*)for Him, and, he again answered,
“Lord, Thou knowest that I love (*amo*) Thee.”  But on the third
interrogation the Lord Himself no longer says, “Hast thou a regard
(*diligis*) for me,”but “Lovest thou (*amas*) me?”  And then the
evangelist adds, “Peter was grieved because He said unto him the third
time, “Lovest thou (*amas*) me?” though the Lord had not said three
times but only once, “Lovest thou (*amas*) me?” and twice “*Diligis me*
?” from which we gather that, even when the Lord said “*diligis*,” He
used an equivalent for “*amas*.”  Peter, too, throughout used one word
for the one thing, and the third time also replied, “Lord, Thou knowest
all things, Thou knowest that I love (*amo*) Thee.” <span
id="fr_662"></span>[663](#fn_662.md)

<span id="iv.XIV.7-p5"></span>I have judged it right to mention this,
because some are of opinion that charity or regard (*dilectio*) is one
thing, love (*amor*) another.  They say that *dilectio* is used of a
good affection, *amor* of an evil love.  But it is very certain that
even secular literature knows no such distinction.  However, it is for
the philosophers to determine whether and how they differ, though their
own writings sufficiently testify that they make great account of love
(*amor*) placed on good objects, and even on God Himself.  But we wished
to show that the Scriptures of our religion, whose authority we prefer
to all writings whatsoever, make no distinction between *amor*,
*dilectio*, and *caritas*; and we have already shown that *amor* is used
in a good connection.  And if any one fancy that *amor* is no doubt used
both of good and bad loves, but that *dilectio* is reserved for the good
only, let him remember what the psalm says, “He that loveth (*diligit*)
iniquity hateth his own soul;” <span id="fr_663"></span>[664](#fn_663.md)
and the words of the Apostle John, “If any man love (*diligere*) the
world, the love (*dilectio*) of the Father is not in him.” <span
id="fr_664"></span>[665](#fn_664.md)   Here you have in one passage
*dilectio* used both in a good and a bad sense.  And if any one demands
an instance of *amor* being used in a bad sense (for we have already
shown its use in a good sense), let him read the words, “For men shall
be lovers (*amantes*) of their own selves, lovers (*amatores*) of
money.” <span id="fr_665"></span>[666](#fn_665.md)

<span id="page_267">p. 267</span> <span id="iv.XIV.7-Page_267"></span>

<span id="iv.XIV.7-p9"></span>The right will is, therefore,
well-directed love, and the wrong will is ill-directed love.  Love,
then, yearning to have what is loved, is desire; and having and enjoying
it, is joy; fleeing what is opposed to it, it is fear; and feeling what
is opposed to it, when it has befallen it, it is sadness.  Now these
motions are evil if the love is evil; good if the love is good.  What we
assert let us prove from Scripture.  The apostle “desires to depart, and
to be with Christ.” <span id="fr_666"></span>[667](#fn_666.md)   And, “My
soul desired to long for Thy judgments;” <span
id="fr_667"></span>[668](#fn_667.md) or if it is more appropriate to say,
“My soul longed to desire Thy judgments.”  And, “The desire of wisdom
bringeth to a kingdom.” <span id="fr_668"></span>[669](#fn_668.md)   Yet
there has always obtained the usage of understanding desire and
concupiscence in a bad sense if the object be not defined.  But joy is
used in a good sense:  “Be glad in the Lord, and rejoice, ye
righteous.” <span id="fr_669"></span>[670](#fn_669.md)   And, “Thou hast
put gladness in my heart.” <span id="fr_670"></span>[671](#fn_670.md)  
And, “Thou wilt fill me with joy with Thy countenance.” <span
id="fr_671"></span>[672](#fn_671.md)   Fear is used in a good sense by the
apostle when he says, “Work out your salvation with fear and
trembling.” <span id="fr_672"></span>[673](#fn_672.md)   And, “Be not
high-minded, but fear.” <span id="fr_673"></span>[674](#fn_673.md)   And,
“I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his
subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is
in Christ.” <span id="fr_674"></span>[675](#fn_674.md)   But with respect
to sadness, which Cicero prefer to calls sickness (*œgritudo*), and
Virgil pain (*dolor*) (as he says, “*Dolent gaudentque*” <span
id="fr_675"></span>[676](#fn_675) .md), but which I prefer to call sorrow,
because sickness and pain are more commonly used to express bodily
suffering,—with respect to this emotion, I say, the question whether it
can be used in a good sense is more difficult.
