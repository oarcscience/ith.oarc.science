id="iv.XIII.12-p1.1"></span>Chapter 12.—What Death God Intended, When He
Threatened Our First Parents with Death If They Should Disobey His
Commandment.</span>

<span id="iv.XIII.12-p2"></span>When, therefore, it is asked what death
it was with which God threatened our first parents if they should
transgress the commandment they had received from Him, and should fail
to preserve their obedience,—whether it was the death of soul, or of
body, or of the whole man, or that which is called second death,—we must
answer, It is all.  For the first consists of two; the second is the
complete death, which consists of all.  For, as the whole earth consists
of many lands, and the Church universal of many churches, so death
universal consists of all deaths.  The first consists of two, one of the
body, and another of the soul.  So that the first death is a death of
the whole man, since the soul without God and without the body suffers
punishment for a time; but <span id="page_251">p. 251</span> <span
id="iv.XIII.12-Page_251"></span> the second is when the soul, without
God but with the body, suffers punishment everlasting.  When, therefore,
God said to that first man whom he had placed in Paradise, referring to
the forbidden fruit, “In the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt
surely die,” <span id="fr_592"></span>[593](#fn_592.md) that threatening
included not only the first part of the first death, by which the soul
is deprived of God; nor only the subsequent part of the first death, by
which the body is deprived of the soul; nor only the whole first death
itself, by which the soul is punished in separation from God and from
the body;—but it includes whatever of death there is, even to that final
death which is called second, and to which none is subsequent.
