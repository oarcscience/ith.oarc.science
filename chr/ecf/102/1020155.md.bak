<span id="iv.V.14-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.V.14-p1.1"></span>Chapter 14.—Concerning the Eradication of the
Love of Human Praise, Because All the Glory of the Righteous is in
God.</span>

<span id="iv.V.14-p2"></span>It is, therefore, doubtless far better to
resist this desire than to yield to it, for the purer one is from this
defilement, the liker is he to God; and, though this vice be not
thoroughly eradicated from his heart,—for it does not cease to tempt
even the minds of those who are making good progress in virtue,—at any
rate, let the desire of glory be surpassed by the love of righteousness,
so that, if there be seen anywhere “lying neglected things which are
generally discredited,” <span id="page_97">p. 97</span> <span
id="iv.V.14-Page_97"></span> if they are good, if they are right, even
the love of human praise may blush and yield to the love of truth.  For
so hostile is this vice to pious faith, if the love of glory be greater
in the heart than the fear or love of God, that the Lord said, “How can
ye believe, who look for glory from one another, and do not seek the
glory which is from God alone?” <span id="fr_210"></span>[211](#fn_210.md)
  Also, concerning some who had believed on Him, but were afraid to
confess Him openly, the evangelist says, “They loved the praise of men
more than the praise of God;” <span id="fr_211"></span>[212](#fn_211.md)
which did not the holy apostles, who, when they proclaimed the name of
Christ in those places where it was not only discredited, and therefore
neglected,—according as Cicero says, “Those things are always neglected
which are generally discredited,”—but was even held in the utmost
detestation, holding to what they had heard from the Good Master, who
was also the physician of minds, “If any one shall deny me before men,
him will I also deny before my Father who is in heaven, and before the
angels of God,” <span id="fr_212"></span>[213](#fn_212.md) amidst
maledictions and reproaches, and most grievous persecutions and cruel
punishments, were not deterred from the preaching of human salvation by
the noise of human indignation.  And when, as they did and spake divine
things, and lived divine lives, conquering, as it were, hard hearts, and
introducing into them the peace of righteousness, great glory followed
them in the church of Christ, they did not rest in that as in the end of
their virtue, but, referring that glory itself to the glory of God, by
whose grace they were what they were, they sought to kindle, also by
that same flame, the minds of those for whose good they consulted, to
the love of Him, by whom they could be made to be what they themselves
were.  For their Master had taught them not to seek to be good for the
sake of human glory, saying, “Take heed that ye do not your
righteousness before men to be seen of them, or otherwise ye shall not
have a reward from your Father who is in heaven.” <span
id="fr_213"></span>[214](#fn_213.md)   But again, lest, understanding this
wrongly, they should, through fear of pleasing men, be less useful
through concealing their goodness, showing for what end they ought to
make it known, He says, “Let your works shine before men, that they may
see your good deeds, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.” <span
id="fr_214"></span>[215](#fn_214.md)   Not, observe, “that ye may be seen
by them, that is, in order that their eyes may be directed upon
you,”—for of yourselves ye are, nothing,—but “that they may glorify your
Father who is in heaven,” by fixing their regards on whom they may
become such as ye are.  These the martyrs followed, who surpassed the
Scævolas, and the Curtiuses, and the Deciuses, both in true virtue,
because in true piety, and also in the greatness of their number.  But
since those Romans were in an earthly city, and had before them, as the
end of all the offices undertaken in its behalf, its safety, and a
kingdom, not in heaven, but in earth,—not in the sphere of eternal life,
but in the sphere of demise and succession, where the dead are succeeded
by the dying,—what else but glory should they love, by which they wished
even after death to live in the mouths of their admirers?
