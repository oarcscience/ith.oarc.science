<span id="iv.V.7-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.V.7-p1.1"></span>Chapter 7.—Concerning the Choosing of a Day for
Marriage, or for Planting, or Sowing.</span>

<span id="iv.V.7-p2"></span>Now, will any one bring forward this, that
in choosing certain particular days for particular actions, men bring
about certain new destinies for their actions?  That man, for instance,
according to this doctrine, was not born to have an illustrious son, but
rather a contemptible one, and therefore, being a man of learning, he
choose an hour in which to lie with his wife.  He made, therefore, a
destiny which he did not have before, and from that destiny of his own
making something began to be fatal which was not contained in the
destiny of his natal hour.  Oh, singular stupidity!  A day is chosen on
which to marry; and for this reason, I believe, that unless a day be
chosen, the marriage may fall on an unlucky day, and turn out an unhappy
one.  What then becomes of what the stars have already decreed at the
hour of birth?  Can a man be said to change by an act of choice that
which has already been determined for him, whilst that which he himself
has determined in the choosing of a day cannot be changed by another
power?  Thus, if men alone, and not all things under heaven, are subject
to the influence of the stars, why do <span id="page_89">p. 89</span>
<span id="iv.V.7-Page_89"></span> they choose some days as suitable for
planting vines or trees, or for sowing grain, other days as suitable for
taming beasts on, or for putting the males to the females, that the cows
and mares may be impregnated, and for such-like things?  If it be said
that certain chosen days have an influence on these things, because the
constellations rule over all terrestrial bodies, animate and inanimate,
according to differences in moments of time, let it be considered what
innumerable multitudes of beings are born or arise, or take their origin
at the very same instant of time, which come to ends so different, that
they may persuade any little boy that these observations about days are
ridiculous.  For who is so mad as to dare affirm that all trees, all
herbs, all beasts, serpents, birds, fishes, worms, have each separately
their own moments of birth or commencement?  Nevertheless, men are wont,
in order to try the skill of the mathematicians, to bring before them
the constellations of dumb animals, the constellations of whose birth
they diligently observe at home with a view to this discovery; and they
prefer those mathematicians to all others, who say from the inspection
of the constellations that they indicate the birth of a beast and not of
a man.  They also dare tell what kind of beast it is, whether it is a
wool-bearing beast, or a beast suited for carrying burthens, or one fit
for the plough, or for watching a house; for the astrologers are also
tried with respect to the fates of dogs, and their answers concerning
these are followed by shouts of admiration on the part of those who
consult them.  They so deceive men as to make them think that during the
birth of a man the births of all other beings are suspended, so that not
even a fly comes to life at the same time that he is being born, under
the same region of the heavens.  And if this be admitted with respect to
the fly, the reasoning cannot stop there, but must ascend from flies
till it lead them up to camels and elephants.  Nor are they willing to
attend to this, that when a day has been chosen whereon to sow a field,
so many grains fall into the ground simultaneously, germinate
simultaneously, spring up, come to perfection, and ripen simultaneously;
and yet, of all the ears which are coeval, and, so to speak,
*congerminal*, some are destroyed by mildew, some are devoured by the
birds, and some are pulled by men.  How can they say that all these had
their different constellations, which they see coming to so different
ends?  Will they confess that it is folly to choose days for such
things, and to affirm that they do not come within the sphere of the
celestial decree, whilst they subject men alone to the stars, on whom
alone in the world God has bestowed free wills?  All these things being
considered, we have good reason to believe that, when the astrologers
give very many wonderful answers, it is to be attributed to the occult
inspiration of spirits not of the best kind, whose care it is to
insinuate into the minds of men, and to confirm in them, those false and
noxious opinions concerning the fatal influence of the stars, and not to
their marking and inspecting of horoscopes, according to some kind of
art which in reality has no existence.
