<span id="iv.XIII.21-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XIII.21-p1.1"></span>Chapter 21.—Of Paradise, that It Can Be
Understood in a Spiritual Sense Without Sacrificing the Historic Truth
of the Narrative Regarding The Real Place.</span>

<span id="iv.XIII.21-p2"></span>On this account some allegorize all that
concerns Paradise itself, where the first men, the parents of the human
race, are, according to the truth of holy Scripture, recorded to have
been; and they understand all its trees and fruit-bearing plants as
virtues and habits of life, as if they had no existence in the external
world, but were only so spoken of or related for the sake of spiritual
meanings.  As if there could not be a real terrestrial Paradise!  As if
there never existed these two women, Sarah and Hagar, nor the two sons
who were born to Abraham, the one of the bond woman, the other of the
free, because the apostle says that in them the two covenants were
prefigured; or as if water never flowed from the rock when Moses struck
it, because therein Christ can be seen in a figure, as the same apostle
says, “Now that rock was Christ!” <span
id="fr_606"></span>[607](#fn_606)   No one, then, denies that Paradise
may signify the life of the blessed; its four rivers, the four virtues,
prudence, fortitude, temperance, and justice; its trees, all useful
knowledge; its fruits, the customs of the godly; its tree of life,
wisdom herself, the mother of all good; and the tree of the knowledge of
good and evil, the experience of a broken commandment.  The punishment
which God appointed was in itself, a just, and therefore a good thing;
but man’s experience of it is not good.

<span id="iv.XIII.21-p4"></span>These things can also and more
profitably be understood of the Church, so that they become prophetic
foreshadowings of things to come.  Thus Paradise is the Church, as it is
called in the Canticles; <span id="fr_607"></span>[608](#fn_607) the
four rivers of Paradise are the four gospels; the fruit-trees the
saints, and the fruit their works; the tree of life is the holy of
holies, Christ; the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, the will’s
free choice.  For if man despise the will of God, he can only destroy
himself; and so he learns the difference between consecrating himself to
the common good and revelling in his own.  For he who loves himself is
abandoned to himself, in order that, being overwhelmed with fears and
sorrows, he may cry, if there be yet soul in him to feel his ills, in
the words of the psalm, “My soul is cast down within me,” <span
id="fr_608"></span>[609](#fn_608) and when chastened, may say,” Because
of his strength I will wait upon Thee.” <span
id="fr_609"></span>[610](#fn_609)   These and similar allegorical
interpretations may be suitably put upon Paradise without giving offence
to any one, while yet we believe the strict truth of the history,
confirmed by its circumstantial narrative of facts. <span

will find a pretty full collection of opinions in the learned commentary
on Genesis by the Jesuit Pererius.  Philo was, of course, the leading
culprit, but Ambrose and other Church fathers went nearly as far. 
Augustin condemns the Seleucians for this among other heresies, that
they denied a visible Paradise.—*De Hæres*. 59.
