<span id="iv.XXI.23-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XXI.23-p1.1"></span>Chapter 23.—Against Those Who are of Opinion
that the Punishment Neither of the Devil Nor of Wicked Men Shall Be
Eternal.</span>

<span id="iv.XXI.23-p2"></span>First of all, it behoves us to inquire
and to recognize why the Church has not been able to tolerate the idea
that promises cleansing or indulgence to the devil even after the most
severe and protracted punishment.  For so many holy men, imbued with the
spirit of the Old and New Testament, did not grudge to angels of any
rank or character that they should enjoy the blessedness of the heavenly
kingdom after being cleansed by suffering, but rather they perceived
that they could not invalidate nor evacuate the divine sentence which
the Lord predicted that He would pronounce in the judgment, saying,
“Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the
devil and his angels.” <span id="fr_1540"></span>[1541](#fn_1540.md)   For
<span id="page_469">p. 469</span> <span id="iv.XXI.23-Page_469"></span>
here it is evident that the devil and his angels shall burn in
everlasting fire.  And there is also that declaration in the Apocalypse,
“The devil their deceiver was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone,
where also are the beast and the false prophet.  And they shall be
tormented day and night for ever.” <span
id="fr_1541"></span>[1542](#fn_1541.md)   In the former passage
“everlasting” is used, in the latter “for ever;” and by these words
Scripture is wont to mean nothing else than endless duration.  And
therefore no other reason, no reason more obvious and just, can be found
for holding it as the fixed and immovable belief of the truest piety,
that the devil and his angels shall never return to the justice and life
of the saints, than that Scripture, which deceives no man, says that God
spared them not, and that they were condemned beforehand by Him, and
cast into prisons of darkness in hell, <span
id="fr_1542"></span>[1543](#fn_1542.md) being reserved to the judgment of
the last day, when eternal fire shall receive them, in which they shall
be tormented world without end.  And if this be so, how can it be
believed that all men, or even some, shall be withdrawn from the
endurance of punishment after some time has been spent in it? how can
this be believed without enervating our faith in the eternal punishment
of the devils?  For if all or some of those to whom it shall be said,
“Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the
devil and his angels,” <span id="fr_1543"></span>[1544](#fn_1543.md) are
not to be always in that fire, then what reason is there for believing
that the devil and his angels shall always be there?  Or is perhaps the
sentence of God, which is to be pronounced on wicked men and angels
alike, to be true in the case of the angels, false in that of men? 
Plainly it will be so if the conjectures of men are to weigh more than
the word of God.  But because this is absurd, they who desire to be rid
of eternal punishment ought to abstain from arguing against God, and
rather, while yet there is opportunity, obey the divine commands.  Then
what a fond fancy is it to suppose that eternal punishment means long
continued punishment, while eternal life means life without end, since
Christ in the very same passage spoke of both in similar terms in one
and the same sentence, “These shall go away into eternal punishment, but
the righteous into life eternal!” <span
id="fr_1544"></span>[1545](#fn_1544.md)   If both destinies are “eternal,”
then we must either understand both as long-continued but at last
terminating, or both as endless.  For they are correlative,—on the one
hand, punishment eternal, on the other hand, life eternal.  And to say
in one and the same sense, life eternal shall be endless, punishment
eternal shall come to an end, is the height of absurdity.  Wherefore, as
the eternal life of the saints shall be endless, so too the eternal
punishment of those who are doomed to it shall have no end.
