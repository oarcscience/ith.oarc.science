id="v.IV_1.19-p1.1"></span>Chapter 19.—The Christian Teacher Must Use
Different Styles on Different Occasions.</span>

<span id="v.IV_1.19-p2"></span>38.  And yet, while our teacher ought to
speak of great matters, he ought not always to be speaking of them in a
majestic tone, but in a subdued tone when he is teaching, temperately
when he is giving praise or blame.  When, however, something is to be
done, and we are speaking to those who ought, but are not willing, to do
it, then great matters must be spoken of with power, and in a manner
calculated to sway the mind.  And sometimes the same important matter is
treated in all these ways at different times, quietly when it is being
taught, temperately when its importance is being urged, and powerfully
when we are forcing a mind that is averse to the truth to turn and
embrace it.  For is there anything greater than God Himself?  Is
nothing, then, to be learnt about Him?  Or ought he who is teaching the
Trinity in unity to speak of it otherwise than in the method of calm
discussion, so that in regard to a subject which it is not easy to
comprehend, we may understand as much as it is given us to understand? 
Are we in this case to seek out ornaments instead of proofs?  Or is the
hearer to be moved to do something instead of being instructed so that
he may learn something?  But when we come to praise God, either in
Himself, or in His works, what a field for beauty and splendor of
language opens up before man, who can task his powers to the utmost in
praising Him whom no one can adequately praise, though there is no one
who does not praise Him in some measure!  But if He be not worshipped,
or if idols, whether they be demons or any created being whatever, be
worshipped with Him or in preference to Him, then we ought to speak out
with power and impressiveness, show how great a wickedness this is, and
urge men to flee from it.
