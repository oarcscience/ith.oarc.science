<span id="iv.XV.24-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XV.24-p1.1"></span>Chapter 24.—How We are to Understand This
Which the Lord Said to Those Who Were to Perish in the Flood:  “Their
Days Shall [Be 120](../../../bib/apo/bel001.htm#120.md)<span
id="iv.XV.24-p1.2"></span> Years.”</span>

<span id="iv.XV.24-p2"></span>But that which God said, “Their days shall
be a hundred and twenty years,” is not to be understood as a prediction
that henceforth men should not live longer than 120 years,—for even
after the deluge we find that they lived more than 500 years,—but we are
to understand that God said this when Noah had nearly completed his
fifth century, that is, had lived 480 years, which Scripture, as it
frequently uses the name of the whole of the largest part, calls 500
years.  Now the deluge came in the 600th year of Noah’s life, the second
month; and thus 120 years were predicted as being the remaining span of
those who were doomed, which years being spent, they should be destroyed
by the deluge.  And it is not unreasonably believed that the deluge came
as it did, because already there were not found upon earth any who were
not worthy of sharing a death so manifestly judicial,—not that a good
man, who must die some time, would be a jot the worse of such a death
after it was past.  Nevertheless there died in the deluge none of those
mentioned in the sacred Scripture as descended from Seth.  But here is
the divine account of the cause of the deluge:  “The Lord God saw that
the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination
of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.  And it
repented <span id="fr_851"></span>[852](#fn_851.md) the Lord that He had
made man on the earth, and it grieved Him at His heart.  And the Lord
said, I will destroy man, whom I have created, from the face of the
earth; both man and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the
air:  for I am angry that I have made them.” <span
