<span id="iv.II_1.16-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.II_1.16-p1.1"></span>Chapter 16.—That If the Gods Had Really
Possessed Any Regard for Righteousness, the Romans Should Have Received
Good Laws from Them, Instead of Having to Borrow Them from Other
Nations.</span>

<span id="iv.II_1.16-p2"></span>Moreover, if the Romans had been able to
receive a rule of life from their gods, they would not have borrowed
Solon’s laws from the Athenians, as they did some years after Rome was
founded; and yet they did not keep them as they received them, but
endeavored to improve and amend them. <span
id="fr_109"></span>[110](#fn_109.md)   Although Lycurgus pretended that he
was authorized by Apollo to give laws to the Lacedemonians, the sensible
Romans did not choose to believe this, and were not induced to borrow
laws from Sparta.  Numa Pompilius, who succeeded Romulus in the kingdom,
is said to have framed some laws, which, however, were not sufficient
for the regulation of civic affairs.  Among these regulations were many
pertaining to religious observances, and yet he is not reported to have
received even these from the gods.  With respect, then, to moral evils,
evils of life and conduct,—evils which are so mighty, that, according to
the wisest pagans, <span id="fr_110"></span>[111](#fn_110.md) by them
states are ruined while their cities stand uninjured,—their gods made
not the smallest provision for preserving their worshippers from these
evils, but, on the contrary, took special pains to increase them, as we
have previously endeavored to prove.

<span id="iv.II_1.16-p3"></span> In the year <span class="c20"><span
id="iv.II_1.16-p3.1"></span> a.u.</span> 299, three ambassadors were
sent from Rome to Athens to copy Solon’s laws, and acquire information
about the institutions of Greece.  On their return the Decemviri were
appointed to draw up a code; and finally, after some tragic
interruptions, the celebrated twelve tables were accepted as the
fundamental statutes of Roman law (*fons universi publici privatique
juris*).  These were graven on brass, and hung up for public
information.  Livy, iii. 31–34.
