id="iv.XVIII.9-p1.1"></span>Chapter 9.—When the City of Athens Was
Founded, and What Reason Varro Assigns for Its Name.</span>

<span id="iv.XVIII.9-p2"></span>Athens certainly derived its name from
Minerva, who in Greek is called <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.XVIII.9-p2.1"></span>᾽Αθηνη</span>, and Varro points out the
following reason why it was so called.  When an olive-tree suddenly
appeared there, and water burst forth in another place, these prodigies
moved the king to send to the Delphic Apollo to inquire what they meant
and what he should do.  He answered that the olive signified Minerva,
the water Neptune, and that the citizens had it in their power to name
their city as they chose, after either of these two gods whose signs
these were.  On receiving this oracle, Cecrops convoked all the citizens
of either sex to give their vote, for it was then the custom in those
parts for the women also to take part in public deliberations.  When the
multitude was consulted, the men gave their votes for Neptune, the women
for Minerva; and as the women had a majority of one, Minerva conquered. 
Then Neptune, being enraged, laid waste the lands of the Athenians, by
casting up the waves of the sea; for the demons have no difficulty in
scattering any waters more widely.  The same authority said, that to
appease his wrath the women should be visited by the Athenians with the
three-fold punishment—that they should no longer have any vote; that
none of their children should be named after their mothers; and that no
one should call them Athenians.  Thus that city, the mother and nurse of
liberal doctrines, and of so many and so great philosophers, than whom
Greece had nothing more famous and noble, by the mockery of demons about
the strife of their gods, a male and female, and from the victory of the
female one through the women, received the name of Athens; and, on being
damaged by the vanquished god, was compelled to punish the very victory
of the victress, fearing the waters of Neptune more than the arms of
Minerva.  For in the women who were thus punished, Minerva, who had
conquered, was conquered too, and could not even help her voters so far
that, although the right of voting was henceforth lost, and the mothers
could not give their names to the children, they might at least be
allowed to be called Athenians, and to merit the name of that goddess
whom they had made victorious over a male god by giving her their
votes.  What and how much could be said about this, if we had not to
hasten to other things in our discourse, is obvious.
