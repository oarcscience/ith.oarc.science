id="iv.XXII.7-p1.1"></span>Chapter 7.—That the World’s Belief in Christ
is the Result of Divine Power, Not of Human Persuasion.</span>

<span id="iv.XXII.7-p2"></span>But it is thoroughly ridiculous to make
mention of the false divinity of Romulus as any way comparable to that
of Christ.  Nevertheless, if Romulus lived about six hundred years
before Cicero, in an age which already was so enlightened that it
rejected all impossibilities, how much more, in an age which certainly
was more enlightened, being six hundred years later, the age of Cicero
himself, and of the emperors Augustus and Tiberius, would the human mind
have refused to listen to or believe in the resurrection of Christ’s
body and its ascension into heaven, and have scouted it as an
impossibility, had not the divinity of the truth itself, or the truth of
the divinity, and corroborating miraculous signs, proved that it could
happen and had happened?  Through virtue of these testimonies, and
notwithstanding the opposition and terror of so many cruel persecutions,
the resurrection and immortality of the flesh, first in Christ, and
subsequently in all in the new world, was believed, was intrepidly
proclaimed, and was sown over the whole world, to be fertilized richly
with the blood of the martyrs.  For the predictions of the prophets that
had preceded the events were read, they were corroborated by powerful
signs, and the truth was seen to be not contradictory to reason, but
only different from customary ideas, so that at length the world
embraced the faith it had furiously persecuted.
