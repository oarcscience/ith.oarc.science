<span id="iv.XIV.25-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XIV.25-p1.1"></span>Chapter 25.—Of True Blessedness, Which This
Present Life Cannot Enjoy.</span>

<span id="iv.XIV.25-p2"></span>However, if we look at this a little more
closely, we see that no one lives as he wishes but the blessed, and that
no one is blessed but the righteous.  But even the righteous himself
does not live as he wishes, until he has arrived where he cannot die, be
deceived, or injured, and until he is assured that this shall be his
eternal condition.  For this nature demands; and nature is not fully and
perfectly blessed till it attains what it seeks.  But what man is at
present able to live as he wishes, when it is not in his power so much
as to live?  He wishes to live, he is compelled to die.  How, then, does
he live as he wishes who does not live as long as he wishes? or if he
wishes to die, how can he live as he wishes, since he does not wish even
to live?  Or if he wishes to die, not because he dislikes life, but that
after death he may live better, still he is not yet living as he wishes,
but only has the prospect of so living when, through death, he reaches
that which he wishes.  But admit that he lives as he wishes, because he
has done violence to himself, and forced himself not to wish what he
cannot obtain, and to wish only what he can (as Terence has it, “Since
you cannot do what you will, will what you can” <span
id="fr_758"></span>[759](#fn_758) .md), is he therefore blessed because he
is patiently wretched?  For a blessed life is possessed only by the man
who loves it.  If it is loved and possessed, it must necessarily be more
ardently loved than all besides; for whatever else is loved must be
loved for the sake of the blessed life.  And if it is loved as it
deserves to be,—and the man is not blessed who does not love the blessed
life as it deserves,—then he who so loves it cannot but wish it to be
eternal.  Therefore it shall then only be blessed when it is eternal.
