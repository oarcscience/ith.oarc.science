<span id="iv.XIV.20-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XIV.20-p1.1"></span>Chapter 20.—Of the Foolish Beastliness of the
Cynics.</span>

<span id="iv.XIV.20-p2"></span>It is this which those canine or
cynic <span id="fr_747"></span>[748](#fn_747.md) philosophers have
overlooked, when they have, in violation of the modest instincts of men,
boastfully proclaimed their unclean and shameless opinion, worthy indeed
of dogs, viz., that as the matrimonial act is legitimate, no one should
be ashamed to perform it openly, in the street or in any public place. 
Instinctive shame has overborne this wild fancy.  For though it is
related <span id="fr_748"></span>[749](#fn_748.md) that Diogenes once dared
to put his opinion in practice, under the impression that his sect would
be all the more famous if his egregious shamelessness were deeply graven
in the memory of mankind, yet this example was not afterwards followed.
<span id="page_278">p. 278</span> <span id="iv.XIV.20-Page_278"></span>
Shame had more influence with them, to make them blush before men, than
error to make them affect a resemblance to dogs.  And possibly, even in
the case of Diogenes, and those who did imitate him, there was but an
appearance and pretence of copulation, and not the reality.  Even at
this day there are still Cynic philosophers to be seen; for these are
Cynics who are not content with being clad in the *pallium*, but also
carry a club; yet no one of them dares to do this that we speak of.  If
they did, they would be spat upon, not to say stoned, by the mob.  Human
nature, then, is without doubt ashamed of this lust; and justly so, for
the insubordination of these members, and their defiance of the will,
are the clear testimony of the punishment of man’s first sin.  And it
was fitting that this should appear specially in those parts by which is
generated that nature which has been altered for the worse by that first
and great sin,—that sin from whose evil connection no one can escape,
unless God’s grace expiate in him individually that which was
perpetrated to the destruction of all in common, when all were in one
man, and which was avenged by God’s justice.
