id="iv.XVI.22-p1.1"></span>Chapter 22.—Of Abraham’s Overcoming the
Enemies of Sodom, When He Delivered Lot from Captivity and Was Blessed
by Melchizedek the Priest.</span>

<span id="iv.XVI.22-p2"></span>Having received this oracle of promise,
Abraham migrated, and remained in another place of the same land, that
is, beside the oak of Mamre, which was Hebron.  Then on the invasion of
Sodom, when five kings carried on war against four, and Lot was taken
captive with the conquered Sodomites, Abraham delivered him from the
enemy, leading with him to battle three hundred and eighteen of his
home-born servants, and won the victory for the kings of Sodom, but
would take nothing of the spoils when offered by the king for whom he
had won them.  He was then openly blessed by Melchizedek, who was priest
of God Most High, about whom many and great things are written in the
epistle which is inscribed to the Hebrews, which most say is by the
Apostle Paul, though some deny this.  For then first appeared the
sacrifice which is now offered to God by Christians in the whole wide
world, and that is fulfilled which long after the event was said by the
prophet to Christ, who was yet to come in the flesh, “Thou art a priest
for ever after the order of Melchizedek,” <span

of Aaron, for that order was to be taken away when the things shone
forth which were intimated beforehand by these shadows.
