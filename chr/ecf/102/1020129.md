id="iv.IV.24-p1.1"></span>Chapter 24.—The Reasons by Which the Pagans
Attempt to Defend Their Worshipping Among the Gods the Divine Gifts
Themselves.</span>

<span id="iv.IV.24-p2"></span>We may, however, consider their reasons. 
Is it to be believed, say they, that our forefathers were besotted even
to such a degree as not to know that these things are divine gifts, and
not gods?  But as they knew that such things are granted to no one,
except by some god freely bestowing them, they called the gods whose
names they did not find out by the names of those things which they
deemed to be given by them; sometimes slightly altering the name for
that purpose, as, for example, from war they have named Bellona, not
*bellum*; from cradles, Cunina, not *cunæ*; from standing corn, Segetia,
not *seges*; from apples, Pomona, not *pomum*; from oxen, Bubona, not
*bos*. Sometimes, again, with no alteration of the word, just as the
things themselves are named, so that the goddess who gives money is
called Pecunia, and money is not thought to be itself a goddess:  so of
Virtus, who gives virtue; Honor, who gives honor; Concordia, who gives
concord; Victoria, who gives victory.  So, they say, when Felicitas is
called a goddess, what is meant is not the thing itself which is given,
but that deity by whom felicity is given.
