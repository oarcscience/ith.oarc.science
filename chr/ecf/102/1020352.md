<span id="iv.XII.13-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XII.13-p1.1"></span>Chapter 13.—Of the Revolution of the Ages,
Which Some Philosophers Believe Will Bring All Things Round Again, After
a Certain Fixed Cycle, to the Same Order and Form as at First.</span>

<span id="iv.XII.13-p2"></span>This controversy some philosophers have
seen no other approved means of solving than by introducing cycles of
time, in which there should be a constant renewal and repetition of the
order of nature; <span id="fr_542"></span>[543](#fn_542) and they have
therefore asserted that these cycles will ceaselessly recur, one passing
away and another coming, though they are not agreed as to whether one
permanent world shall pass through all these cycles, or whether the
world shall at fixed intervals die out, and be renewed so as to exhibit
a recurrence of the same phenomena—the things which have been, and those
which are to be, coinciding.  And from this fantastic vicissitude they
exempt not even the immortal soul that has attained wisdom, consigning
it to a ceaseless transmigration between delusive blessedness and real
misery.  For how can that be truly called blessed which has no assurance
of being so eternally, and is either in ignorance of the truth, and
blind to the misery that is approaching, or, knowing it, is in misery
and fear?  Or if it passes to bliss, and leaves miseries forever, then
there happens in time a new thing which time shall not end.  Why not,
then, the world also?  Why may not man, too, be a similar thing?  So
that, by following the straight path of sound doctrine, we escape, I
know not what circuitous paths, discovered by deceiving and deceived
sages.

<span id="iv.XII.13-p4"></span>Some, too, in advocating these recurring
cycles that restore all things to their original cite in favor of their
supposition what Solomon says in the book of Ecclesiastes:  “What is
that which hath been?  It is that which shall be.  And what is that
which is done?  It is that which shall be done:  and there is no new
thing under the sun.  Who can speak and say, See, this is new?  It hath
been already of old time, which was before us.” <span
id="fr_543"></span>[544](#fn_543)   This he said either of those things
of which he had just been speaking—the succession of generations, the
orbit of the sun, the course of rivers,—or else of all kinds of
creatures that are born and die.  For men were before us, are with us,
and shall be after us; and so all living things and all plants.  Even
monstrous and irregular productions, though differing from one another,
and though some are reported as solitary instances, yet resemble one
another generally, in so far as they are miraculous and monstrous, and,
in this sense, have been, and shall be, and are no new and recent things
under the sun.  However, some would understand these words as meaning
that in the predestination of God all things have already existed, and
that thus there is no new thing under the sun.  At all events, far be it
from any true believer to suppose that by these words of Solomon those
cycles are meant, in which, according to those philosophers, the same
periods and events of time are repeated; as if, for example, the
philosopher Plato, having taught in the school at Athens which is called
the Academy, so, numberless ages before, at long but certain intervals,
this same Plato and the same school, and the same disciples existed, and
so also are to be repeated during the countless cycles that are yet to
be,—far be it, I say, from us to believe this.  For once Christ died for
our sins; and, rising from the dead, He dieth no more.  “Death hath no
more dominion over Him; <span id="fr_544"></span>[545](#fn_544) and we
ourselves after the resurrection shall be “ever with the Lord,” <span
id="fr_545"></span>[546](#fn_545) to whom we now say, as the sacred
Psalmist dictates, “Thou shall keep us, O Lord, Thou shall preserve us
from this generation.” <span id="fr_546"></span>[547](#fn_546)   And
that too which follows, is, I think, appropriate enough:  “The wicked
walk *in a circle*,” not because their life is to recur by means of
these circles, which these philosophers imagine, but because the path in
which their false doctrine now runs is circuitous.

from eternity are of like forms, and come round in a circle.”  Cf. also
ix. 28, and the references to more ancient philosophical writers in
Gataker’s notes in these passages.
