<span id="iv.IX.20-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.IX.20-p1.1"></span>Chapter 20.—Of the Kind of Knowledge Which
Puffs Up the Demons.</span>

<span id="iv.IX.20-p2"></span>However, the very origin of the name
suggests something worthy of consideration, if we compare it with the
divine books.  They are called demons from a Greek word meaning
knowledge. <span id="fr_357"></span>[358](#fn_357.md)   Now the apostle,
speaking with the Holy Spirit, says, “Knowledge puffeth up, but charity
buildeth up.” <span id="fr_358"></span>[359](#fn_358.md)   And this <span
id="page_177">p. 177</span> <span id="iv.IX.20-Page_177"></span> can
only be understood as meaning that without charity knowledge does no
good, but inflates a man or magnifies him with an empty windiness.  The
demons, then, have knowledge without charity, and are thereby so
inflated or proud, that they crave those divine honors and religious
services which they know to be due to the true God, and still, as far as
they can, exact these from all over whom they have influence.  Against
this pride of the demons, under which the human race was held subject as
its merited punishment, there was exerted the mighty influence of the
humility of God, who appeared in the form of a servant; but men,
resembling the demons in pride, but not in knowledge, and being puffed
up with uncleanness, failed to recognize Him.
