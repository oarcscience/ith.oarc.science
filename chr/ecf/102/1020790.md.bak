<span id="v.vi.x-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="v.vi.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter 10.—How We are to Discern Whether a
Phrase is Figurative.</span>

<span id="v.vi.x-p2"></span>14.  But in addition to the foregoing rule,
which guards us against taking a metaphorical form of speech as if it
were literal, we must also pay heed to that which tells us not to take a
literal form of speech as if it were figurative.  In the first place,
then, we must show the way to find out whether a phrase is literal or
figurative.  And the way is certainly as follows:  Whatever there is in
the word of God that cannot, when taken literally, be referred either to
purity of life or soundness of doctrine, you may set down as
figurative.  Purity of life has reference to the love of God <span
id="page_561">p. 561</span> <span id="v.vi.x-Page_561"></span> and one’s
neighbor; soundness of doctrine to the knowledge of God and one’s
neighbor.  Every man, moreover, has hope in his own conscience, so far
as he perceives that he has attained to the love and knowledge of God
and his neighbor.  Now all these matters have been spoken of in the
first book.

<span id="v.vi.x-p3"></span>15.  But as men are prone to estimate sins,
not by reference to their inherent sinfulness, but rather by reference
to their own customs, it frequently happens that a man will think
nothing blameable except what the men of his own country and time are
accustomed to condemn, and nothing worthy of praise or approval except
what is sanctioned by the custom of his companions; and thus it comes to
pass, that if Scripture either enjoins what is opposed to the customs of
the hearers, or condemns what is not so opposed, and if at the same time
the authority of the word has a hold upon their minds, they think that
the expression is figurative.  Now Scripture enjoins nothing except
charity, and condemns nothing except lust, and in that way fashions the
lives of men.  In the same way, if an erroneous opinion has taken
possession of the mind, men think that whatever Scripture asserts
contrary to this must be figurative.  Now Scripture asserts nothing but
the catholic faith, in regard to things past, future, and present.  It
is a narrative of the past, a prophecy of the future, and a description
of the present.  But all these tend to nourish and strengthen charity,
and to overcome and root out lust.

<span id="v.vi.x-p4"></span>16.  I mean by charity that affection of the
mind which aims at the enjoyment of God for His own sake, and the
enjoyment of one’s self and one’s neighbor in subordination to God; by
lust I mean that affection of the mind which aims at enjoying one’s self
and one’s neighbor, and other corporeal things, without reference to
God.  Again, what lust, when unsubdued, does towards corrupting one’s
own soul and body, is called *vice*; <span
id="fr_1858"></span>[1859](#fn_1858.md) but what it does to injure another
is called *crime*. <span id="fr_1859"></span>[1860](#fn_1859.md)   And
these are the two classes into which all sins may be divided.  But the
vices come first; for when these have exhausted the soul, and reduced it
to a kind of poverty, it easily slides into crimes, in order to remove
hindrances to, or to find assistance in, its vices.  In the same way,
what charity does with a view to one’s own advantage is *prudence*; but
what it does with a view to a neighbor’s advantage is called
*benevolence*.  And here prudence comes first; because no one can confer
an advantage on another which he does not himself possess.  Now in
proportion as the dominion of lust is pulled down, in the same
proportion is that of charity built up.
