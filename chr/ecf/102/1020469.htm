<p class="c21"><a name="iv.XVI.20-p2"></A>On Abraham&#146;s return out of Egypt to the place he had left, Lot, his brother&#146;s son, departed from him into the land of Sodom, without breach of charity.&#160; For they had grown rich, and began to have many herdmen of cattle, and when these strove together, they avoided in this way the pugnacious discord of their families.&#160; Indeed, as human affairs go, this cause might even have given rise to some strife between themselves.&#160; Consequently these are the words of Abraham to Lot, when taking precaution against this evil, &#8220;Let there be no strife between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we be brethren.&#160; Behold, is not the whole land before thee?&#160; Separate thyself from me:&#160; if thou wilt go to the left hand, I will go to the right; or if thou wilt go to the right hand, I will go to the left.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_904"></A><A HREF="#fn_904"><FONT SIZE="1">905</FONT></A>
&#160; From this, perhaps, has arisen a pacific custom among men, that when there is any partition of earthly things, the greater should make the division, the less the choice.</p>
