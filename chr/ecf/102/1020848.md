id="v.IV_1.30-p1.1"></span>Chapter 30.—The Preacher Should Commence His
Discourse with Prayer to God.</span>

<span id="v.IV_1.30-p2"></span>63.  But whether a man is going to
address the people or to dictate what others will deliver or read to the
people, he ought to pray God to put into his mouth a suitable
discourse.  For if Queen Esther prayed, when she was about to speak to
the king touching the temporal welfare of her race, that God would put
fit words into her mouth, <span id="fr_2022"></span>[2023](#fn_2022.md) how
much more ought he to pray for the same blessing who labors in word and
doctrine for the eternal welfare of men?  Those, again, who are to
deliver what others compose for them ought, before they receive their
discourse, to pray for those who are preparing it; and when they have
received it, they ought to pray both that they themselves may deliver it
well, and that those to whom they address it may give ear; and when the
discourse has a happy issue, they ought to render thanks to Him from
whom they know such blessings come, so that all the praise may be His
“in whose hand are both we and our words.” <span
