id="v.iv.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 19.—Bodily and Spiritual Death and
Resurrection.</span>

<span id="v.iv.xix-p2"></span>18.  Furthermore, as there is a kind of
death of the soul, which consists in the putting away of former habits
and former ways of life, and which comes through repentance, so also the
death of the body consists in the dissolution of the former principle of
life.  And just as the soul, after it has put away and destroyed by
repentance its former habits, is created anew after a better pattern, so
we must hope and believe that the body, after that death which we all
owe as a debt contracted through sin, shall at the resurrection be
changed into a better form;—not that flesh and blood shall inherit the
kingdom of God (for that is impossible), but that this corruptible shall
put on incorruption, and this mortal shall put on immortality. <span

source of no uneasiness because it can feel no want, shall be animated
by a spirit perfectly pure and happy, and shall enjoy unbroken peace.
