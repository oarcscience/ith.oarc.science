<span id="iv.XVIII.17-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XVIII.17-p1.1"></span>Chapter 17.—What Varro Says of the
Incredible Transformations of Men.</span>

<span id="iv.XVIII.17-p2"></span>In support of this story, Varro relates
others no less incredible about that most famous sorceress Circe, who
changed the companions of Ulysses into beasts, and about the Arcadians,
who, by lot, swam across a certain pool, and were turned into wolves
there, and lived in the deserts of that region with wild beasts like
themselves.  But if they never fed on human flesh for nine years, they
were restored to the human form on swimming back again through the same
pool.  Finally, he expressly names one Demænetus, who, on tasting a boy
offered up in sacrifice by the Arcadians to their god Lycæus according
to their custom, was changed into a wolf, and, being restored to his
proper form in the tenth year, trained himself as a pugilist, and was
victorious at the Olympic games.  And the same historian thinks that the
epithet Lycæus was applied in Arcadia to Pan and Jupiter for no other
reason than this metamorphosis of men into wolves, because it was
thought it could not be wrought except by a divine power.  For a wolf is
called in Greek <span class="Greek"><span

appears to be formed.  He says also that the Roman Luperci were as it
were sprung of the seed of these mysteries.
