<span id="iv.XVIII.23-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XVIII.23-p1.1"></span>Chapter 23.—Of the Erythræan Sibyl, Who is
Known to Have Sung Many Things About Christ More Plainly Than the Other
Sibyls. <span id="fr_1145"></span>[1146](#fn_1145.md) </span>

<span id="iv.XVIII.23-p3"></span>Some say the Erythræan sibyl prophesied
at this time.  Now Varro declares there were many sibyls, and not merely
one.  This sibyl of Erythræ certainly wrote some things concerning
Christ which are quite manifest, and we first read them in the Latin
tongue in verses of bad Latin, and unrhythmical, through the
unskillfulness, as we afterwards learned, of some interpreter unknown to
me.  For Flaccianus, a very famous man, who was also a proconsul, a man
of most ready eloquence and much learning, when we were speaking about
Christ, produced a Greek manuscript, saying that it was the prophecies
of the Erythræan sibyl, in which he pointed out a certain passage which
had the initial letters of the lines so arranged that these words could
be read in them:  <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.XVIII.23-p3.1"></span>᾽Ιησοῦς Χριστος Θεοῦ υιὸς σωτηρ</span>,
which means, “Jesus Christ the Son of God, the Saviour.”  And these
verses, of which the initial letters yield that meaning, contain what
follows as translated by some one into Latin in good rhythm:

<span id="iv.XVIII.23-p4"></span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.XVIII.23-p4.1"></span>Ι</span>            Judgment shall moisten
the earth with the sweat of its standard,

<span id="iv.XVIII.23-p5"></span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.XVIII.23-p5.1"></span>Η</span>   Ever enduring, behold the King
shall come through the ages,

<span id="iv.XVIII.23-p6"></span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.XVIII.23-p6.1"></span>Σ</span>    Sent to be here in the flesh,
and Judge at the last of the world.

<span id="iv.XVIII.23-p7"></span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.XVIII.23-p7.1"></span>Ο</span>   O God, the believing and
faithless alike shall behold Thee

<span id="iv.XVIII.23-p8"></span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.XVIII.23-p8.1"></span>Υ</span>   Uplifted with saints, when at
last the ages are ended.

<span id="iv.XVIII.23-p9"></span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.XVIII.23-p9.1"></span>Σ</span>    Seated before Him are souls in
the flesh for His judgment.

<span id="iv.XVIII.23-p10"></span>

<span id="page_373">p. 373</span> <span
id="iv.XVIII.23-Page_373"></span>

<span id="iv.XVIII.23-p11"></span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.XVIII.23-p11.1"></span>Χ</span>   Hid in thick vapors, the while
desolate lieth the earth.

<span id="iv.XVIII.23-p12"></span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.XVIII.23-p12.1"></span>Ρ</span>            Rejected by men are
the idols and long hidden treasures;

<span id="iv.XVIII.23-p13"></span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.XVIII.23-p13.1"></span>Ε</span>    Earth is consumed by the fire,
and it searcheth the ocean and heaven;

<span id="iv.XVIII.23-p14"></span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.XVIII.23-p14.1"></span>Ι</span>     Issuing forth, it destroyeth
the terrible portals of hell.

<span id="iv.XVIII.23-p15"></span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.XVIII.23-p15.1"></span>Σ</span>    Saints in their body and soul
freedom and light shall inherit;

<span id="iv.XVIII.23-p16"></span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.XVIII.23-p16.1"></span>Τ</span>    Those who are guilty shall
burn in fire and brimstone for ever.

<span id="iv.XVIII.23-p17"></span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.XVIII.23-p17.1"></span>Ο</span>   Occult actions revealing, each
one shall publish his secrets;

<span id="iv.XVIII.23-p18"></span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.XVIII.23-p18.1"></span>Σ</span>    Secrets of every man’s heart
God shall reveal in the light.

<span id="iv.XVIII.23-p19"></span>

<span id="iv.XVIII.23-p20"></span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.XVIII.23-p20.1"></span>Θ</span>   Then shall be weeping and
wailing, yea, and gnashing of teeth;

<span id="iv.XVIII.23-p21"></span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.XVIII.23-p21.1"></span>Ε</span>            Eclipsed is the sun,
and silenced the stars in their chorus.

<span id="iv.XVIII.23-p22"></span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.XVIII.23-p22.1"></span>Ο</span>   Over and gone is the splendor
of moonlight, melted the heaven,

<span id="iv.XVIII.23-p23"></span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.XVIII.23-p23.1"></span>Υ</span>   Uplifted by Him are the
valleys, and cast down the mountains.

<span id="iv.XVIII.23-p24"></span>

<span id="iv.XVIII.23-p25"></span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.XVIII.23-p25.1"></span>Υ</span>   Utterly gone among men are
distinctions of lofty and lowly.

<span id="iv.XVIII.23-p26"></span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.XVIII.23-p26.1"></span>Ι</span>     Into the plains rush the
hills, the skies and oceans are mingled.

<span id="iv.XVIII.23-p27"></span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.XVIII.23-p27.1"></span>Ο</span>   Oh, what an end of all things!
earth broken in pieces shall perish;

<span id="iv.XVIII.23-p28"></span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.XVIII.23-p28.1"></span>Σ</span>   .   .   .   .    Swelling
together at once shall the waters and flames flow in rivers.

<span id="iv.XVIII.23-p29"></span>

<span id="iv.XVIII.23-p30"></span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.XVIII.23-p30.1"></span>Σ</span>            Sounding the
archangel’s trumpet shall peal down from heaven,

<span id="iv.XVIII.23-p31"></span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.XVIII.23-p31.1"></span>Ω</span>   Over the wicked who groan in
their guilt and their manifold sorrows.

<span id="iv.XVIII.23-p32"></span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.XVIII.23-p32.1"></span>Τ</span>            Trembling, the earth
shall be opened, revealing chaos and hell.

<span id="iv.XVIII.23-p33"></span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.XVIII.23-p33.1"></span>Η</span>   Every king before God shall
stand in that day to be judged.

<span id="iv.XVIII.23-p34"></span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.XVIII.23-p34.1"></span>Ρ</span>    Rivers of fire and brimstone
shall fall from the heavens.

<span id="iv.XVIII.23-p35"></span>In these Latin verses the meaning of
the Greek is correctly given, although not in the exact order of the
lines as connected with the initial letters; for in three of them, the
fifth, eighteenth, and nineteenth, where the Greek letter <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.XVIII.23-p35.1"></span>Υ</span> occurs, Latin
words could not be found beginning with the corresponding letter, and
yielding a suitable meaning.  So that, if we note down together the
initial letters of all the lines in our Latin translation except those
three in which we retain the letter <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.XVIII.23-p35.2"></span>Υ</span> in the proper place, they will
express in five Greek words this meaning, “Jesus Christ the Son of God,
the Saviour.”  And the verses are twenty-seven, which is the cube of
three.  For three times three are nine; and nine itself, if tripled, so
as to rise from the superficial square to the cube, comes to
twenty-seven.  But if you join the initial letters of these five Greek
words, <span class="Greek"><span id="iv.XVIII.23-p35.3"></span>᾽Ιησοῦς
Χριστος Θεοῦ υἰὸς σωτήρ</span>, which mean, “Jesus Christ the Son of
God, the Saviour,” they will make the word <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.XVIII.23-p35.4"></span>ἰχδὺς</span>, that is, “fish,” in which
word Christ is mystically understood, because He was able to live, that
is, to exist, without sin in the abyss of this mortality as in the depth
of waters. <span id="fr_1146"></span>[1147](#fn_1146.md)

<span id="iv.XVIII.23-p37"></span>But this sibyl, whether she is the
Erythræan, or, as some rather believe, the Cumæan, in her whole poem, of
which this is a very small portion, not only has nothing that can relate
to the worship of the false or feigned gods, but rather speaks against
them and their worshippers in such a way that we might even think she
ought to be reckoned among those who belong to the city of God. 
Lactantius also inserted in his work the prophecies about Christ of a
certain sibyl, he does not say which.  But I have thought fit to combine
in a single extract, which may seem long, what he has set down in many
short quotations.  She says, “Afterward He shall come into the injurious
hands of the unbelieving, and they will give God buffets with profane
hands, and with impure mouth will spit out envenomed spittle; but He
will with simplicity yield His holy back to stripes.  And He will hold
His peace when struck with the fist, that no one may find out what word,
or whence, He comes to speak to hell; and He shall be crowned with a
crown of thorns.  And they gave Him gall for meat, and vinegar for His
thirst:  they will spread this table of inhospitality.  For thou
thyself, being foolish, hast not understood thy God, deluding the minds
of mortals, but hast both crowned Him with thorns and mingled for Him
bitter gall.  But the veil of the temple shall be rent; and at midday it
shall be darker than night for three hours.  And He shall die the death,
taking sleep for three days; and then returning from hell, He first
shall come to the light, the beginning of the resurrection being shown
to the recalled.”  Lactantius made use of these sibylline testimonies,
introducing them bit by bit in the course of his discussion as the
things he intended to prove seemed to require, and we have set them down
in one connected series, uninterrupted by comment, only taking care to
mark them by capitals, if only the transcribers do not neglect to
preserve them hereafter.  Some writers, indeed, say that the Erythræan
sibyl was not in the time of Romulus, but of the Trojan war.

<span id="iv.XVIII.23-p2"></span> The *Sibylline Oracles* are a
collection of prophecies and religious teachings in Greek hexameter
under the assumed authority and inspiration of a Sibyl, *i.e.*, a female
prophet.  They are partly of heathen, partly of Jewish-Christian
origin.  They were used by the fathers against the heathen as genuine
prophecies without critical discrimination, and they appear also in the
famous *Dies iræ* alongside with David as witnesses of the future
judgment (“*teste David cum Sibylla.*”)  They were edited by Alexander,
Paris, 2d. ed. 1869, and by Friedlieb (in Greek and German), Leipzig,
1852.  Comp. Ewald:  *<span id="iv.XVIII.23-p2.1"></span>Ueber
