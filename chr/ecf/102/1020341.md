<span id="iv.XII.2-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XII.2-p1.1"></span>Chapter 2.—That There is No Entity <span
id="fr_525"></span>[526](#fn_525.md) Contrary to the Divine, Because
Nonentity Seems to Be that Which is Wholly Opposite to Him Who Supremely
and Always is.</span>

<span id="iv.XII.2-p3"></span>This may be enough to prevent any one from
supposing, when we speak of the apostate angels, that they could have
another nature, derived, as it were, from some different origin, and not
from God.  From the great impiety of this error we shall disentangle
ourselves the more readily and easily, the more distinctly we understand
that which God spoke by the angel when He sent Moses to the children of
Israel:  “I am that I am.” <span id="fr_526"></span>[527](#fn_526.md)   For
since God is the supreme existence, that is to say, supremely is, and is
therefore unchangeable, the things that He made He empowered to be, but
not to be supremely like Himself.  To some He communicated a more ample,
to others a more limited existence, and thus arranged the natures of
beings in ranks.  For as from *sapere* comes *sapientia*, so from *esse*
comes *essentia*,—a new word indeed, which the old Latin writers did not
use, but which is naturalized in our day, <span
id="fr_527"></span>[528](#fn_527.md) that our language may not want an
equivalent for the Greek <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.XII.2-p5.1"></span>οὐσία</span>.  For this is expressed word for
word by *essentia*.  Consequently, to that nature which supremely is,
and which created all else that exists, no nature is contrary save that
which does not exist.  For nonentity is the contrary of that which is. 
And thus there is no being contrary to God, the Supreme Being, and
Author of all beings whatsoever.
