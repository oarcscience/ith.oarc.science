<span id="iv.XXI.12-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XXI.12-p1.1"></span>Chapter 12.—Of the Greatness of the First
Transgression, on Account of Which Eternal Punishment is Due to All Who
are Not Within the Pale of the Saviour’s Grace.</span>

<span id="iv.XXI.12-p2"></span>But eternal punishment seems hard and
unjust to human perceptions, because in the weakness of our mortal
condition there is wanting that highest and purest wisdom by which it
can be perceived how great a wickedness was committed in that first
transgression.  The more enjoyment man found in God, the greater was his
wickedness in abandoning Him; and he who destroyed in himself a good
which might have been eternal, became worthy of eternal evil.  Hence the
whole mass of the human race is condemned; for he who at first gave
entrance to sin has been punished with all his posterity who were in him
as in a root, so that no one is exempt from this just and due
punishment, unless delivered by mercy and undeserved grace; and the
human race is so apportioned that in some is displayed the efficacy of
merciful grace, in the rest the efficacy of just retribution.  For both
could not be displayed in all; for if all had remained <span
id="fr_1517"></span>[1518](#fn_1517) under the punishment of just
condemnation, there would have been seen in no one the mercy of
redeeming grace.  And, on the other hand, if all had been transferred
from darkness to light, the severity of retribution would have been
manifested in none.  But many more are left under punishment than are
delivered from it, in order that it may thus be shown what was due to
all.  And had it been inflicted on all, no one could justly have found
fault with the justice of Him who taketh vengeance; whereas, in the
deliverance of so many from that just award, there is cause to render
the most cordial thanks to the gratuitous bounty of Him who delivers.
