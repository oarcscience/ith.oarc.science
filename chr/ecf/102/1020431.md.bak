<span id="iv.XV.10-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XV.10-p1.1"></span>Chapter 10.—Of the Different Computation of
the Ages of the Antediluvians, Given by the Hebrew Manuscripts and by
Our Own. <span id="fr_802"></span>[803](#fn_802.md) </span>

<span id="iv.XV.10-p3"></span>Wherefore, although there is a discrepancy
for which I cannot account between our manuscripts and the Hebrew, in
the very number of years assigned to the antediluvians, yet the
discrepancy is not so great that they do not agree about their
longevity.  For the very first man, Adam, before he begot his son Seth,
is in our manuscripts found to have lived 230 years, but in the Hebrew
<span class="c20"><span id="iv.XV.10-p3.1"></span>mss</span>. 130.  But
after he begot Seth, our copies read that he lived 700 years, while the
Hebrew give 800.  And thus, when the two periods are taken together, the
sum agrees.  And so throughout the succeeding generations, the period
before the father begets a son is always made shorter by 100 years in
the Hebrew, but the period after his son is begotten is longer by 100
years in the Hebrew than in our copies.  And thus, taking the two
periods together, the result is the same in both.  And in the sixth
generation there is no discrepancy at all.  In the seventh, however, of
which Enoch is the representative, who is recorded to have been
translated without death because he pleased God, there is the same
discrepancy as in the first five generations, 100 years more being
ascribed to him by our <span class="c20"><span
id="iv.XV.10-p3.2"></span>mss</span>. before he begat a son.  But still
the result agrees; for according to both documents he lived before he
was translated 365 years.  In the eighth generation the discrepancy is
less than in the others, and of a different kind.  For Methuselah, whom
Enoch begat, lived, before he begat his successor, not 100 years less,
but 100 years more, according to the Hebrew reading; and in our <span
id="page_292">p. 292</span> <span id="iv.XV.10-Page_292"></span> <span
class="c11"><span id="iv.XV.10-p3.3"></span>mss</span>. again these
years are added to the period after he begat his son; so that in this
case also the sum-total is the same.  And it is only in the ninth
generation, that is, in the age of Lamech, Methuselah’s son and Noah’s
father, that there is a discrepancy in the sum total; and even in this
case it is slight.  For the Hebrew <span class="c20"><span
id="iv.XV.10-p3.4"></span>mss</span>. represent him as living
twenty-four years more than ours assign to him.  For before he begat his
son, who was called Noah, six years fewer are given to him by the Hebrew
<span class="c20"><span id="iv.XV.10-p3.5"></span>mss.</span> than by
ours; but after he begat this son, they give him thirty years more than
ours; so that, deducting the former six, there remains, as we said, a
surplus of twenty-four.

<span id="iv.XV.10-p2"></span> Our own <span class="c20"><span

were the Latin versions of the Septuagint used by the Church before
Jerome’s was received; the “Hebrew <span class="c20"><span

Hebrew text.  Compare *De Doct. Christ*. ii. 15 et seqq.
