<span id="v.IV_1.24-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="v.IV_1.24-p1.1"></span>Chapter 24.—The Effects Produced by the
Majestic Style.</span>

<span id="v.IV_1.24-p2"></span>53.  If frequent and vehement applause
follows a speaker, we are not to suppose on that account that he is
speaking in the majestic style; for this effect is often produced both
by the accurate distinctions of the quiet style, and by the beauties of
the temperate.  The majestic style, on the other hand, frequently
silences the audience by its impressiveness, but calls forth their
tears.  For example, when at Cæsarea in Mauritania I was dissuading the
people from that civil, or worse than civil, war which they called
*Caterva* (for it was not fellow-citizens merely, but neighbors,
brothers, fathers and sons even, who, divided into two factions and
armed with stones, fought annually at a certain season of the year for
several days continuously, every one killing whomsoever he could), I
strove with all the vehemence of speech that I could command to root out
and drive from their hearts and lives an evil so cruel and inveterate;
it was not, however, when I heard their applause, but when I saw their
tears, that I thought I had produced an effect.  For the applause showed
that they were instructed and de <span id="page_594">p. 594</span> <span
id="v.IV_1.24-Page_594"></span> lighted, but the tears that they were
subdued.  And when I saw their tears I was confident even before the
event proved it, that this horrible and barbarous custom (which had been
handed down to them from their fathers and their ancestors of
generations long gone by and which like an enemy was besieging their
hearts, or rather had complete possession of them) was overthrown; and
immediately that my sermon was finished I called upon them with heart
and voice to give praise and thanks to God.  And, lo, with the blessing
of Christ, it is now eight years or more since anything of the sort was
attempted there.  In many other cases besides I have observed that men
show the effect made on them by the powerful eloquence of a wise man,
not by clamorous applause so much as by groans, sometimes even by tears,
finally by change of life.

<span id="v.IV_1.24-p3"></span>54.  The quiet style, too, has made a
change in many; but it was to teach them what they were ignorant of, or
to persuade them of what they thought incredible, not to make them do
what they knew they ought to do but were unwilling to do.  To break down
hardness of this sort, speech needs to be vehement.  Praise and censure,
too, when they are eloquently expressed, even in the temperate style,
produce such an effect on some, that they are not only pleased with the
eloquence of the encomiums and censures, but are led to live so as
themselves to deserve praise, and to avoid living so as to incur blame. 
But no one would say that all who are thus delighted change their habits
in consequence, whereas all who are moved by the majestic style act
accordingly, and all who are taught by the quiet style know or believe a
truth which they were previously ignorant of.
