<span id="iv.XVIII.46-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XVIII.46-p1.1"></span>Chapter 46.—Of the Birth of Our Saviour,
Whereby the Word Was Made Flesh; And of the Dispersion of the Jews Among
All Nations, as Had Been Prophesied.</span>

<span id="iv.XVIII.46-p2"></span>While Herod, therefore, reigned in
Judea, and Cæsar Augustus was emperor at Rome, the state of the republic
being already changed, and the world being set at peace by him, Christ
was born in Bethlehem of Judah, man manifest out of a human virgin, God
hidden out of God the Father.  For so had the prophet foretold: 
“Behold, a virgin shall conceive in the womb, and bring forth a Son, and
they shall call His name Immanuel, which, being interpreted, is, God
with us.” <span id="fr_1223"></span>[1224](#fn_1223.md)   He did many
miracles that He might commend God in Himself, some of which, even as
many as seemed sufficient to proclaim Him, are contained in the
evangelic Scripture.  The first of these is, that He was so wonderfully
born, and the last, that with His body raised up again from the dead He
ascended into heaven.  But the Jews who slew Him, and would not believe
in Him, because it behoved Him to die and rise again, were yet more
miserably wasted by the Romans, and utterly rooted out from their
kingdom, where aliens had already ruled over them, and were dispersed
through the lands (so that indeed there is no place where they are not),
and are thus by their own Scriptures a testimony to us that we have not
forged the prophecies about Christ.  And very many of them, considering
this, even before His passion, but chiefly after His resurrection,
believed on Him, of whom it was predicted, “Though the number of the
children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, the remnant shall be
saved.” <span id="fr_1224"></span>[1225](#fn_1224.md)   But the rest are
blinded, of whom it was predicted, “Let their table be made before them
a trap, and a retribution, and a stumbling-block.  Let their eyes be
darkened lest they see, and bow down their back alway.” <span
id="fr_1225"></span>[1226](#fn_1225.md)   Therefore, when they do not
believe our Scriptures, their own, which they blindly read, are
fulfilled in them, lest perchance any one should say that the Christians
have forged these prophecies about Christ which are quoted under the
name of the sibyl, or of others, if such there be, who do not belong to
the Jewish people.  For us, indeed, those suffice which are quoted from
the books of our enemies, to whom we make our acknowledgment, on account
of this testimony which, in spite of themselves, they contribute by
their possession of these books, while they themselves are dispersed
among all nations, wherever the Church of Christ is spread abroad.  For
a prophecy about this thing was sent before in the Psalms, which they
also read, where it is written, “My God, His mercy shall prevent me.  My
God hath shown me concerning mine enemies, that Thou shalt not slay
them, lest they should at last forget Thy law:  disperse them in Thy
might.” <span id="fr_1226"></span>[1227](#fn_1226.md)   Therefore God has
shown the Church in her enemies the Jews the grace of His compassion,
since, as saith the apostle, “their offence is the salvation of the
Gentiles.” <span id="fr_1227"></span>[1228](#fn_1227.md)   And therefore He
has not slain them, that is, He has not let the knowledge that they are
Jews be lost in them, although they have been conquered by the Romans,
lest they should forget the law of God, and their testimony should be of
no avail in this matter of which we treat.  But it was not enough that
he should say, “Slay them not, lest they should at last forget Thy law,”
unless he had also added, “Disperse them;” because if they had only been
in their own land with that testimony of the Scriptures, and not every
where, certainly the Church which is everywhere could not have had them
as witnesses among all nations to the prophecies which were sent before
concerning Christ.
