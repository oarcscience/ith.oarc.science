<span id="v.IV_1.14-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="v.IV_1.14-p1.1"></span>Chapter 14.—Beauty of Diction to Be in
Keeping with the Matter.</span>

<span id="v.IV_1.14-p2"></span>30.  And so much labor has been spent by
men on the beauty of expression here spoken of, that not only is it not
our duty to do, but it is our duty to shun and abhor, many and heinous
deeds of wickedness and baseness which wicked and base men have with
great eloquence recommended, not with a view to gaining assent, but
merely for the sake of being read with pleasure.  But may God avert from
His Church what the prophet Jeremiah says of the synagogue of the Jews: 
“A wonderful and horrible thing is committed in the land:  the prophets
prophesy falsely, and the priests applaud them with their hands; <span
id="fr_1952"></span>[1953](#fn_1952.md) and my people love to have it so: 
and what will ye do in the end thereof?” <span
id="fr_1953"></span>[1954](#fn_1953.md)   O eloquence, which is the more
terrible from its purity, and the more crushing from its solidity! 
Assuredly it is “a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces.”  For to
this God Himself has by the same prophet compared His own word spoken
through His holy prophets. <span id="fr_1954"></span>[1955](#fn_1954.md)  
God forbid, then, God forbid that with us the priest should applaud the
false prophet, and that God’s people should love to have it so.  God
forbid, I say, that with us there should be such terrible madness!  For
what shall we do in the end thereof?  And assuredly it is preferable,
even though what is said should be less intelligible, less pleasing, and
less persuasive, that truth be spoken, and that what is just, not what
is iniquitous, be listened to with pleasure.  But this, of course,
cannot be, unless what is true and just be expressed with elegance.

<span id="v.IV_1.14-p6"></span>31.  In a serious assembly, moreover,
such as is spoken of when it is said, “I will praise Thee among much
people,” <span id="fr_1955"></span>[1956](#fn_1955.md) no pleasure is
derived from that species of eloquence which indeed says nothing that is
false, but which buries small and unimportant truths under a frothy mass
of ornamental words, such as would not be graceful or dignified even if
used to adorn great and fundamental truths.  And something of this sort
occurs in a letter of the blessed Cyprian, which, I think, came there by
accident, or else was inserted designedly with this view, that posterity
might see how the wholesome discipline of Christian teaching had cured
him of that redundancy of language, and confined him to a more dignified
and modest form of eloquence, such as we find in his subsequent letters,
a style which is admired without effort, is sought after with eagerness,
but is not attained without great difficulty.  He says, then, in one
place, “Let us seek this abode:  the neighboring solitudes afford a
retreat where, whilst the spreading shoots of the vine trees, pendulous
and intertwined, creep amongst the supporting reeds, the leafy covering
has made a portico of vine.” <span id="fr_1956"></span>[1957](#fn_1956.md)
  There is wonderful fluency and exuberance of language here; but it is
too florid to be pleasing to serious minds.  But people who are fond of
this style are apt to think that men who do not use it, but employ a
more chastened style, do so because they cannot attain the former, not
because their judgment teaches them to avoid it.  Wherefore this holy
man shows both that he can speak in that style, for he has done so once,
and that he does not choose, for he never uses it again.
