id="iv.XII.7-p1.1"></span>Chapter 7.—That We Ought Not to Expect to Find
Any Efficient Cause of the Evil Will.</span>

<span id="iv.XII.7-p2"></span>Let no one, therefore, look for an
efficient cause of the evil will; for it is not efficient, but
deficient, as the will itself is not an effecting of something, but a
defect.  For defection from that which supremely is, to that which has
less of being,—this is to begin to have an evil will.  Now, to seek to
discover the causes of these defections,—causes, as I have said, not
efficient, but deficient,—is as if some one sought to see darkness, or
hear silence.  Yet both of these are known by us, and the former by
means only of the eye, the latter only by the ear; but not by their
positive actuality, <span id="fr_530"></span>[531](#fn_530) but by their
want of it.  Let no one, then seek to know from me what I know that I do
not know; unless he perhaps wishes to learn to be ignorant of that of
which all we know is, that it cannot be known.  For those things which
are known not by their actuality, but by their want of it, are known, if
our expression may be allowed and understood, by not knowing them, that
by knowing them they may be not known.  For when the eyesight surveys
objects that strike the sense, it nowhere sees darkness but where it
begins not to see.  And so no other sense but the ear can perceive
silence, and yet it is only perceived by not hearing.  Thus, too, our
mind perceives intelligible forms by understanding them; but when they
are deficient, it knows them by not knowing them; for “who can
understand defects?” <span id="fr_531"></span>[532](#fn_531)
