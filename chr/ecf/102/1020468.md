Sarah’s Chastity in Egypt, When Abraham Had Called Her Not His Wife But
His Sister.</span>

<span id="iv.XVI.19-p2"></span>Having built an altar there, and called
upon God, Abraham proceeded thence and dwelt in the desert, and was
compelled by pressure of famine to go on into Egypt.  There he called
his wife his sister, and told no lie.  For she was this also, because
she was near of blood; just as Lot, on account of the same nearness,
being his brother’s son, is called his brother.  Now he did not deny
that she was his wife, but held his peace about it, committing to God
the defence of his wife’s chastity, and providing as a man against human
wiles; because if he had not provided against the danger as much as he
could, he would have been tempting God rather than trusting in Him.  We
have said enough about this matter against the calumnies of Faustus the
Manichæan.  At last what Abraham had expected the Lord to do took
place.  For Pharaoh, king of Egypt, who had taken her to him as his
wife, restored her to her husband on being severely plagued.  And far be
it from us to believe that she was defiled by lying with another;
because it is much more credible that, by these great afflictions,
Pharaoh was not permitted to do this.
