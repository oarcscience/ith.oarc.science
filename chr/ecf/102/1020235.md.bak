<span id="iv.VIII.16-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.VIII.16-p1.1"></span>Chapter 16.—What Apuleius the Platonist
Thought Concerning the Manners and Actions of Demons.</span>

<span id="iv.VIII.16-p2"></span>The same Apuleius, when speaking
concerning the manners of demons, said that they are agitated with the
same perturbations of mind as men; that they are provoked by injuries,
propitiated by services and by gifts, rejoice in honors, are delighted
with a variety of sacred rites, and are annoyed if any of them be
neglected.  Among other things, he also says that on them depend the
divinations of augurs, soothsayers, and prophets, and the revelations of
dreams, and that from them also are the miracles of the magicians.  But,
when giving a brief definition of them, he says, “Demons are of an
animal nature, passive in soul, rational in mind, aerial in body,
eternal in time.”  “Of which five things, the three first are common to
them and us, the fourth peculiar to themselves, and the fifth common to
therewith the gods.” <span id="fr_312"></span>[313](#fn_312.md)   But I see
that they have in common with the gods two of the first things, which
they have in common with us.  For he says that the gods also are
animals; and when he is assigning to every order of beings its own
element, he places us among the other terrestrial animals which live and
feel upon the earth.  Wherefore, if the demons are animals as to genus,
this is common to them, not only with men, but also with the gods and
with beasts; if they are rational as to their mind, this is common to
them with the gods and with men; if they are eternal in time, this is
common to them with the gods only; if they are passive as to their soul,
this is common to them with men only; if they are aerial in body, in
this they are alone.  Therefore it is no great thing for them to be of
an animal nature, for so also are the beasts; in being rational as to
mind, they are not above ourselves, for so are we also; and as to their
being eternal as to time, what is the advantage of that if they are not
blessed? for better is temporal happiness than eternal misery.  Again,
as to their being passive in soul, how are they in this respect above
us, since we also are so, but would not have been so had we not been
miserable?  Also, as to their being aerial in body, how much value is to
be set on that, since a soul of any kind whatsoever is to be set above
every body? and therefore religious worship, which ought to be rendered
from the soul, is by no means due to that thing which is inferior to the
soul.  Moreover, if he had, among those things which he says belong to
demons, enumerated virtue, wisdom, happiness, and affirmed that they
have those things in common with the gods, and, like them, eternally, he
would assuredly have attributed to them something greatly to be desired,
and much to be prized.  And even in that case it would not have been our
duty to worship them like God on account of these things, but rather to
worship Him from whom we know they had received them.  But how much less
are they really worthy of divine honor,—those aerial animals who are
only rational that they may be capable of misery, passive that they may
be actually miserable, and eternal that it may be impossible for them to
end their misery!
