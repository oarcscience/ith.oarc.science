id="v.vi.i-p1.1"></span>Chapter 1 .—Summary of the Foregoing Books, and
Scope of that Which Follows.</span>

<span id="v.vi.i-p2"></span>I.  <span class="c20"><span
id="v.vi.i-p2.1"></span>The</span> man who fears God seeks diligently in
Holy Scripture for a knowledge of His will.  And when he has become meek
through piety, so as to have no love of strife; when furnished also with
a knowledge of languages, so as not to be stopped by unknown words and
forms of speech, and with the knowledge of certain necessary objects, so
as not to be ignorant of the force and nature of those which are used
figuratively; and assisted, besides, by accuracy in the texts, which has
been secured by skill and care in the matter of correction;—when thus
prepared, let him proceed to the examination and solution of the
ambiguities of Scripture.  And that he may not be led astray by
ambiguous signs, so far as I can give him instruction (it may happen,
however, that either from the greatness of his intellect, or the greater
clearness of the light he enjoys, he shall laugh at the methods I am
going to point out as childish),—but yet, as I was going to say, so far
as I can give instruction, let him who is in such a state of mind that
he can be instructed by me know, that the ambiguity of Scripture lies
either in proper words or in metaphorical, classes which I have already
described in the second book. <span id="fr_1832"></span>[1833](#fn_1832.md)
