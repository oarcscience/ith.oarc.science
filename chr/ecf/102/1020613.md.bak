<span id="iv.XX.11-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XX.11-p1.1"></span>Chapter 11.—Of Gog and Magog, Who are to Be
Roused by the Devil to Persecute the Church, When He is Loosed in the
End of the World.</span>

<span id="iv.XX.11-p2"></span>“And when the thousand years are finished,
Satan shall be loosed from his prison, and shall go out to seduce the
nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, and
shall draw them to battle, whose number is as the sand of the sea.” 
This then, is his purpose in seducing them, to draw them to this
battle.  For even before this he was wont to use as many and various
seductions as he could continue.  And the words “he shall go out” mean,
he shall burst forth from lurking hatred into open persecution.  For
this persecution, occurring while the final judgment is imminent, shall
be the last which shall be endured by the holy Church throughout the
world, the whole city of Christ being assailed by the whole city of the
devil, as each exists on earth.  For these nations which he names Gog
and Magog are not to be understood of some barbarous nations in some
part of the world, whether the Getæ and Massagetæ, as some conclude from
the initial letters, or some other foreign nations not under the Roman
government.  For John marks that they are spread over the whole earth,
when he says, “The nations which are in the four corners of the earth,”
and he added that these are Gog and Magog.  The meaning of these names
we find to be, Gog, “a roof,” Magog, “from a roof,”—a house, as it were,
and he who comes out of the house.  They are therefore the nations in
which we found that the devil was shut up as in an abyss, and the devil
himself coming out from them and going forth, so that they are the roof,
he from the roof.  Or if we refer both words to the nations, not one to
them and one to the devil, then they are both the roof, because in them
the old enemy is at present shut up, and as it were roofed in; and they
shall be from the roof when they break forth from concealed to open
hatred.  The words, “And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and
encompassed the camp of the saints and the beloved city,” do not mean
that they have come, or shall come, to one place, as if the camp of the
saints and the beloved city should be in some one place; for this camp
is nothing else than the Church of Christ extending over the whole
world.  And consequently wherever the Church shall be,—and it shall be
in all nations, as is signified by “the breadth of the earth,”—there
also shall be the camp of the saints and the beloved city, and there it
shall be encompassed by the savage persecution of all its enemies; for
they too shall exist along with it in all nations,—that is, it shall be
straitened, and hard pressed, and shut up in the straits of tribulation,
but shall not desert its military duty, which is signified by the word
“camp.”
