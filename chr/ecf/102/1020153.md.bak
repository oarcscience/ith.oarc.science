<span id="iv.V.12-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.V.12-p1.1"></span>Chapter 12.—By What Virtues the Ancient Romans
Merited that the True God, Although They Did Not Worship Him, Should
Enlarge Their Empire.</span>

<span id="iv.V.12-p2"></span>Wherefore let us go on to consider what
virtues of the Romans they were which the true God, in whose power are
also the kingdoms of the earth, condescended to help in order to raise
the empire, and also for what reason He did so.  And, in order to
discuss this question on clearer ground, we have written the former
books, to show that the power of those gods, who, they thought, were to
be worshipped with such trifling and silly rites, had nothing to do in
this matter; and also what we have already accomplished of the present
volume, to refute the doctrine of fate, lest any one who might have been
already persuaded that the Roman empire was not extended and preserved
by the worship of these gods, might still be attributing its extension
and preservation to some kind of fate, rather than to the most powerful
will of God most high.  The ancient and primitive Ro <span
id="page_94">p. 94</span> <span id="iv.V.12-Page_94"></span> mans,
therefore, though their history shows us that, like all the other
nations, with the sole exception of the Hebrews, they worshipped false
gods, and sacrificed victims, not to God, but to demons, have
nevertheless this commendation bestowed on them by their historian, that
they were “greedy of praise, prodigal of wealth, desirous of great
glory, and content with a moderate fortune.” <span
id="fr_197"></span>[198](#fn_197.md)   Glory they most ardently loved:  for
it they wished to live, for it they did not hesitate to die.  Every
other desire was repressed by the strength of their passion for that one
thing.  At length their country itself, because it seemed inglorious to
serve, but glorious to rule and to command, they first earnestly desired
to be free, and then to be mistress.  Hence it was that, not enduring
the domination of kings, they put the government into the hands of two
chiefs, holding office for a year, who were called consuls, not kings or
lords. <span id="fr_198"></span>[199](#fn_198.md)   But royal pomp seemed
inconsistent with the administration of a ruler (*regentis*), or the
benevolence of one who consults (that is, for the public good)
(*consulentis*), but rather with the haughtiness of a lord
(*dominantis*).  King Tarquin, therefore, having been banished, and the
consular government having been instituted, it followed, as the same
author already alluded to says in his praises of the Romans, that “the
state grew with amazing rapidity after it had obtained liberty, so great
a desire of glory had taken possession of it.”  That eagerness for
praise and desire of glory, then, was that which accomplished those many
wonderful things, laudable, doubtless, and glorious according to human
judgment.  The same Sallust praises the great men of his own time,
Marcus Cato, and Caius Cæsar, saying that for a long time the republic
had no one great in virtue, but that within his memory there had been
these two men of eminent virtue, and very different pursuits.  Now,
among the praises which he pronounces on Cæsar he put this, that he
wished for a great empire, an army, and a new war, that he might have a
sphere where his genius and virtue might shine forth.  Thus it was ever
the prayer of men of heroic character that Bellona would excite
miserable nations to war, and lash them into agitation with her bloody
scourge, so that there might be occasion for the display of their
valor.  This, forsooth, is what that desire of praise and thirst for
glory did.  Wherefore, by the love of liberty in the first place,
afterwards also by that of domination and through the desire of praise
and glory, they achieved many great things; and their most eminent poet
testifies to their having been prompted by all these motives:

<span id="iv.V.12-p5"></span>“Porsenna there, with pride elate,

<span id="iv.V.12-p6"></span>Bids Rome to Tarquin ope her gate;

<span id="iv.V.12-p7"></span>With arms he hems the city in,

<span id="iv.V.12-p8"></span>Æneas’ sons stand firm to win.” <span
id="fr_199"></span>[200](#fn_199.md)

<span id="iv.V.12-p10"></span>At that time it was their greatest
ambition either to die bravely or to live free; but when liberty was
obtained, so great a desire of glory took possession of them, that
liberty alone was not enough unless domination also should be sought,
their great ambition being that which the same poet puts into the mouth
of Jupiter:

<span id="iv.V.12-p11"></span>“Nay, Juno’s self, whose wild alarms

<span id="iv.V.12-p12"></span>Set ocean, earth, and heaven in arms,

<span id="iv.V.12-p13"></span>Shall change for smiles her moody frown,

<span id="iv.V.12-p14"></span>And vie with me in zeal to crown

<span id="iv.V.12-p15"></span>Rome’s sons, the nation of the gown.

<span id="iv.V.12-p16"></span>So stands my will.  There comes a day,

<span id="iv.V.12-p17"></span>While Rome’s great ages hold their way,

<span id="iv.V.12-p18"></span>When old Assaracus’s sons

<span id="iv.V.12-p19"></span>Shall quit them on the myrmidons,

<span id="iv.V.12-p20"></span>O’er Phthia and Mycenæ reign,

<span id="iv.V.12-p21"></span>And humble Argos to their chain.” <span
id="fr_200"></span>[201](#fn_200.md)

<span id="iv.V.12-p23"></span>Which things, indeed, Virgil makes Jupiter
predict as future, whilst, in reality, he was only himself passing in
review in his own mind, things which were already done, and which were
beheld by him as present realities.  But I have mentioned them with the
intention of showing that, next to liberty, the Romans so highly
esteemed domination, that it received a place among those things on
which they bestowed the greatest praise.  Hence also it is that that
poet, preferring to the arts of other nations those arts which
peculiarly belong to the Romans, namely, the arts of ruling and
commanding, and of subjugating and vanquishing nations, says,

<span id="iv.V.12-p24"></span>“Others, belike, with happier grace,

<span id="iv.V.12-p25"></span>From bronze or stone shall call the face,

<span id="iv.V.12-p26"></span>Plead doubtful causes, map the skies,

<span id="iv.V.12-p27"></span>And tell when planets set or rise;

<span id="iv.V.12-p28"></span>But Roman thou, do thou control

<span id="iv.V.12-p29"></span>The nations far and wide;

<span id="iv.V.12-p30"></span>Be this thy genius, to impose

<span id="iv.V.12-p31"></span>The rule of peace on vanquished foes,

<span id="iv.V.12-p32"></span>Show pity to the humble soul,

<span id="iv.V.12-p33"></span>And crush the sons of pride.” <span
id="fr_201"></span>[202](#fn_201.md)

<span id="iv.V.12-p35"></span>These arts they exercised with the more
skill the less they gave themselves up to pleasures, and to enervation
of body and mind in coveting and amassing riches, and through these
corrupting morals, by extorting them from the miserable citizens and
lavishing them on base stage-players.  Hence these men of base
character, who abounded when <span id="page_95">p. 95</span> <span
id="iv.V.12-Page_95"></span> Sallust wrote and Virgil sang these things,
did not seek after honors and glory by these arts, but by treachery and
deceit.  Wherefore the same says, “But at first it was rather ambition
than avarice that stirred the minds of men, which vice, however, is
nearer to virtue.  For glory, honor, and power are desired alike by the
good man and by the ignoble; but the former,” he says, “strives onward
to them by the true way, whilst the other, knowing nothing of the good
arts, seeks them by fraud and deceit.” <span
id="fr_202"></span>[203](#fn_202.md)   And what is meant by seeking the
attainment of glory, honor, and power by good arts, is to seek them by
virtue, and not by deceitful intrigue; for the good and the ignoble man
alike desire these things, but the good man strives to overtake them by
the true way.  The way is virtue, along which he presses as to the goal
of possession—namely, to glory, honor, and power.  Now that this was a
sentiment engrained in the Roman mind, is indicated even by the temples
of their gods; for they built in very close proximity the temples of
Virtue and Honor, worshipping as gods the gifts of God.  Hence we can
understand what they who were good thought to be the end of virtue, and
to what they ultimately referred it, namely, to honor; for, as to the
bad, they had no virtue though they desired honor, and strove to possess
it by fraud and deceit.  Praise of a higher kind is bestowed upon Cato,
for he says of him “The less he sought glory, the more it followed
him.” <span id="fr_203"></span>[204](#fn_203.md)   We say praise of a
higher kind; for the glory with the desire of which the Romans burned is
the judgment of men thinking well of men.  And therefore virtue is
better, which is content with no human judgment save that of one’s own
conscience.  Whence the apostle says, “For this is our glory, the
testimony of our conscience.” <span id="fr_204"></span>[205](#fn_204.md)  
And in another place he says, “But let every one prove his own work, and
then he shall have glory in himself, and not in another.” <span
id="fr_205"></span>[206](#fn_205.md)   That glory, honor, and power,
therefore, which they desired for themselves, and to which the good
sought to attain by good arts, should not be sought after by virtue, but
virtue by them.  For there is no true virtue except that which is
directed towards that end in which is the highest and ultimate good of
man.  Wherefore even the honors which Cato sought he ought not to have
sought, but the state ought to have conferred them on him unsolicited,
on account of his virtues.

<span id="iv.V.12-p40"></span>But, of the two great Romans of that time,
Cato was he whose virtue was by far the nearest to the true idea of
virtue.  Wherefore, let us refer to the opinion of Cato himself, to
discover what was the judgment he had formed concerning the condition of
the state both then and in former times.  “I do not think,” he says,
“that it was by arms that our ancestors made the republic great from
being small.  Had that been the case, the republic of our day would have
been by far more flourishing than that of their times, for the number of
our allies and citizens is far greater; and, besides, we possess a far
greater abundance of armor and of horses than they did.  But it was
other things than these that made them great, and we have none of them: 
industry at home, just government without, a mind free in deliberation,
addicted neither to crime nor to lust.  Instead of these, we have luxury
and avarice, poverty in the state, opulence among citizens; we laud
riches, we follow laziness; there is no difference made between the good
and the bad; all the rewards of virtue are got possession of by
intrigue.  And no wonder, when every individual consults only for his
own good, when ye are the slaves of pleasure at home, and, in public
affairs, of money and favor, no wonder that an onslaught is made upon
the unprotected republic.” <span id="fr_206"></span>[207](#fn_206.md)

<span id="iv.V.12-p42"></span>He who hears these words of Cato or of
Sallust probably thinks that such praise bestowed on the ancient Romans
was applicable to all of them, or, at least, to very many of them.  It
is not so; otherwise the things which Cato himself writes, and which I
have quoted in the second book of this work, would not be true.  In that
passage he says, that even from the very beginning of the state wrongs
were committed by the more powerful, which led to the separation of the
people from the fathers, besides which there were other internal
dissensions; and the only time at which there existed a just and
moderate administration was after the banishment of the kings, and that
no longer than whilst they had cause to be afraid of Tarquin, and were
carrying on the grievous war which had been undertaken on his account
against Etruria; but afterwards the fathers oppressed the people as
slaves, flogged them as the kings had done, drove them from their land,
and, to the exclusion of all others, held the government in their own
hands alone.  And to these discords, whilst the fathers were wishing to
rule, and the people were unwilling to serve, the second Punic war put
an end; for again great fear began to press upon their disquieted minds,
holding them back from those distractions by another and greater
anxiety, and <span id="page_96">p. 96</span> <span
id="iv.V.12-Page_96"></span> bringing them back to civil concord.  But
the great things which were then achieved were accomplished through the
administration of a few men, who were good in their own way.  And by the
wisdom and forethought of these few good men, which first enabled the
republic to endure these evils and mitigated them, it waxed greater and
greater.  And this the same historian affirms, when he says that,
reading and hearing of the many illustrious achievements of the Roman
people in peace and in war, by land and by sea, he wished to understand
what it was by which these great things were specially sustained.  For
he knew that very often the Romans had with a small company contended
with great legions of the enemy; and he knew also that with small
resources they had carried on wars with opulent kings.  And he says
that, after having given the matter much consideration, it seemed
evident to him that the pre-eminent virtue of a few citizens had
achieved the whole, and that that explained how poverty overcame wealth,
and small numbers great multitudes.  But, he adds, after that the state
had been corrupted by luxury and indolence, again the republic, by its
own greatness, was able to bear the vices of its magistrates and
generals.  Wherefore even the praises of Cato are only applicable to a
few; for only a few were possessed of that virtue which leads men to
pursue after glory, honor, and power by the true way,—that is, by virtue
itself.  This industry at home, of which Cato speaks, was the
consequence of a desire to enrich the public treasury, even though the
result should be poverty at home; and therefore, when he speaks of the
evil arising out of the corruption of morals, he reverses the
expression, and says, “Poverty in the state, riches at home.”
