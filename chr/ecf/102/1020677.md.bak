id="iv.XXII.16-p1.1"></span>Chapter 16.—What is Meant by the Conforming
of the Saints to the Image of The Son of God.</span>

<span id="iv.XXII.16-p2"></span>Then, again, these words, “Predestinate
to be conformed to the image of the Son of God,” <span
id="fr_1631"></span>[1632](#fn_1631.md) may be understood of the inner
man.  So in another place He says to us, “Be not conformed to this
world, but be ye transformed in the renewing of your mind.” <span
id="fr_1632"></span>[1633](#fn_1632.md)   In so far, then, as we are
transformed so as not to be conformed to the world, we are conformed to
the Son of God.  It may also be understood thus, that as He was
conformed to us by assuming mortality, we shall be conformed to Him by
immortality; and this indeed is connected with the resurrection of the
body.  But if we are also taught in these words what form our bodies
shall rise in, as the measure we spoke of before, so also this
conformity is to be understood not of size, but of age.  Accordingly all
shall rise in the stature they either had attained or would have
attained had they lived to their prime, although it will be no great
disadvantage even if the form of the body be infantine or aged, while no
infirmity shall remain in the mind nor in the body itself.  So that even
if any one contends that every person will rise again in the same bodily
form in which he died, we need not spend much labor in disputing with
him.
