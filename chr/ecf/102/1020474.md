id="iv.XVI.25-p1.1"></span>Chapter 25.—Of Sarah’s Handmaid, Hagar, Whom
She Herself Wished to Be Abraham’s Concubine.</span>

<span id="iv.XVI.25-p2"></span>And here follow the times of Abraham’s
sons, the one by Hagar the bond maid, the other by Sarah the free woman,
about whom we have already spoken in the previous book.  As regards this
transaction, Abraham is in no way to be branded as guilty concerning
this concubine, for he used her for the begetting of progeny, not for
the gratification of lust; and not to insult, but rather to obey his
wife, who supposed it would be solace of her barrenness if she could
make use of the fruitful womb of her handmaid to supply the defect of
her own nature, and by that law of which the apostle says, “Likewise
also the husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife,” <span
id="fr_917"></span>[918](#fn_917) could, as a wife, make use of him for
childbearing by another, when she could not do so in her own person. 
Here there is no wanton lust, no filthy lewdness.  The handmaid is
delivered to the husband by the wife for the sake of progeny, and is
received by the husband for the sake of progeny, each seeking, not
guilty excess, but natural fruit.  And when the pregnant bond woman
despised her barren mistress, and Sarah, with womanly jealousy, rather
laid the blame of this on her husband, even then Abraham showed that he
was not a slavish lover, but a free begetter of children, and that in
using Hagar he had guarded the chastity of Sarah his wife, and had
gratified her will and not his own,—had received her without seeking,
had gone in to her without being attached, had impregnated without
loving her,—for he says, “Behold thy maid is in thy hands:  do to her as
it pleaseth thee;” <span id="fr_918"></span>[919](#fn_918) a man able to
use women as a man should,—his wife temperately, his handmaid
compliantly, neither intemperately!
