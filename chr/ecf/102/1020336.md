<span id="iv.XI.32-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XI.32-p1.1"></span>Chapter 32.—Of the Opinion that the Angels
Were Created Before the World.</span>

<span id="iv.XI.32-p2"></span>But if some one oppose our opinion, and
say that the holy angels are not referred to when it is said, “Let there
be light, and there was light;” if he suppose or teach that some
material light, then first created, was meant, and that the angels were
created, not only before the firmament dividing the waters and named
“the heaven,” but also before the time signified in the words, “In the
beginning God created the heaven and the earth;” if he allege that this
phrase, “In the beginning,” does not mean that nothing was made before
(for the angels were), but that God made all things by His Wisdom or
Word, who is named in Scripture “the Beginning,” as He Himself, in the
gospel, replied to the Jews when they asked Him who He was, that He was
the Beginning; <span id="fr_510"></span>[511](#fn_510.md) —I will not
contest the point, chiefly because it gives me the liveliest
satisfaction to find the Trinity celebrated in the very beginning of the
book of Genesis.  For having said “In the Beginning God created the
heaven and the earth,” meaning that the Father made them in the Son (as
the psalm testifies where it says, “How manifold are Thy works, O Lord!
in Wisdom hast Thou made them all” <span
id="fr_511"></span>[512](#fn_511) .md), a little afterwards mention is
fitly made of the Holy Spirit also.  For, when it had been told us what
kind of earth God created at first, or what the mass or matter was which
God, under the name of “heaven and earth,” had provided for the
construction of the world, as is told in the additional words, “And the
earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the
deep,” then, for the sake of completing the mention of the Trinity, it
is immediately added, “And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the
waters.”  Let <span id="page_224">p. 224</span> <span
id="iv.XI.32-Page_224"></span> each one, then, take it as he pleases;
for it is so profound a passage, that it may well suggest, for the
exercise of the reader’s tact, many opinions, and none of them widely
departing from the rule of faith.  At the same time, let none doubt that
the holy angels in their heavenly abodes are, though not, indeed,
co-eternal with God, yet secure and certain of eternal and true
felicity.  To their company the Lord teaches that His little ones
belong; and not only says, “They shall be equal to the angels of
God,” <span id="fr_512"></span>[513](#fn_512.md) but shows, too, what
blessed contemplation the angels themselves enjoy, saying, “Take heed
that ye despise not one of these little ones:  for I say unto you, that
in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is
in heaven.” <span id="fr_513"></span>[514](#fn_513.md)
