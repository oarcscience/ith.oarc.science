<span id="iv.XVII.6-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XVII.6-p1.1"></span>Chapter 6.—Of the Jewish Priesthood and
Kingdom, Which, Although Promised to Be Established for Ever, Did Not
Continue; So that Other Things are to Be Understood to Which Eternity is
Assured.</span>

<span id="iv.XVII.6-p2"></span>While, therefore, these things now shine
forth as clearly as they were loftily foretold, still some one may not
vainly be moved to ask, How can we be confident that all things are to
come to pass which are predicted in these books as about to come, if
this very thing which is there divinely spoken, “Thine house and thy
father’s house shall walk before me for ever,” could not have effect? 
For we see that priesthood has been changed; and there can be no hope
that what was promised to that house may some time be fulfilled, because
that which succeeds on its being rejected and changed is rather
predicted as eternal.  He who says this does not yet understand, or does
not recollect, that this very priesthood after the order of Aaron was
appointed as the shadow of a future eternal priesthood; and therefore,
when eternity is promised to it, it is not promised to the mere shadow
and figure, but to what is shadowed forth and prefigured by it.  But
lest it should be thought the shadow itself was to remain, therefore its
mutation also behoved to be foretold.

<span id="page_346">p. 346</span> <span id="iv.XVII.6-Page_346"></span>

<span id="iv.XVII.6-p3"></span>In this way, too, the kingdom of Saul
himself, who certainly was reprobated and rejected, was the shadow of a
kingdom yet to come which should remain to eternity.  For, indeed, the
oil with which he was anointed, and from that chrism he is called
Christ, is to be taken in a mystical sense, and is to be understood as a
great mystery; which David himself venerated so much in him, that he
trembled with smitten heart when, being hid in a dark cave, which Saul
also entered when pressed by the necessity of nature, he had come
secretly behind him and cut off a small piece of his robe, that he might
be able to prove how he had spared him when he could have killed him,
and might thus remove from his mind the suspicion through which he had
vehemently persecuted the holy David, thinking him his enemy.  Therefore
he was much afraid lest he should be accused of violating so great a
mystery in Saul, because he had thus meddled even his clothes.  For thus
it is written:  “And David’s heart smote him because he had taken away
the skirt of his cloak.” <span id="fr_1027"></span>[1028](#fn_1027.md)  
But to the men with him, who advised him to destroy Saul thus delivered
up into his hands, he saith, “The Lord forbid that I should do this
thing to my lord, the Lord’s christ, to lay my hand upon him, because he
is the Lord’s christ.”  Therefore he showed so great reverence to this
shadow of what was to come, not for its own sake, but for the sake of
what it prefigured.  Whence also that which Samuel says to Saul, “Since
thou hast not kept my commandment which the Lord commanded thee, whereas
now the Lord would have prepared thy kingdom over Israel for ever, yet
now thy kingdom shall not continue for thee; and the Lord will seek Him
a man after His own heart, and the Lord will command him to be prince
over His people, because thou hast not kept that which the Lord
commanded thee,” <span id="fr_1028"></span>[1029](#fn_1028.md) is not to be
taken as if God had settled that Saul himself should reign for ever, and
afterwards, on his sinning, would not keep this promise; nor was He
ignorant that he would sin, but He had established his kingdom that it
might be a figure of the eternal kingdom.  Therefore he added, “Yet now
thy kingdom shall not continue *for thee*.”  Therefore what it signified
has stood and shall stand; but it shall not stand for this man, because
he himself was not to reign for ever, nor his offspring; so that at
least that word “for ever” might seem to be fulfilled through his
posterity one to another.  “And the Lord,” he saith, “will seek Him a
man,” meaning either David or the Mediator of the New Testament, <span
id="fr_1029"></span>[1030](#fn_1029.md) who was figured in the chrism with
which David also and his offspring was anointed.  But it is not as if He
knew not where he was that God thus seeks Him a man, but, speaking
through a man, He speaks as a man, and in this sense seeks us.  For not
only to God the Father, but also to His Only-begotten, who came to seek
what was lost, <span id="fr_1030"></span>[1031](#fn_1030.md) we had been
known already even so far as to be chosen in Him before the foundation
of the world. <span id="fr_1031"></span>[1032](#fn_1031.md)   “He will seek
Him” therefore means, He will have His own (just as if He had said, Whom
He already has known to be His own He will show to others to be His
friend).  Whence in Latin this word (*quærit*) receives a preposition
and becomes *acquirit* (acquires), the meaning of which is plain enough;
although even without the addition of the preposition *quærere* is
understood as *acquirere*, whence gains are called *quæstus*.
