<span id="iv.XV.19-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XV.19-p1.1"></span>Chapter 19.—The Significance Of Enoch’s
Translation.</span>

<span id="iv.XV.19-p2"></span>For that line also of which Seth is the
father has the name “Dedication” in the seventh generation from Adam,
counting Adam.  For the seventh from him is Enoch, that is, Dedication. 
But this is that man who was translated because he pleased God, and who
held in the order of the generations a remarkable place, being the
seventh from Adam, a number signalized by the consecration of the
Sabbath.  But, counting from the diverging point of the two lines, or
from Seth, he was the sixth.  Now it was on the sixth day God made man,
and consummated His works.  But the translation of Enoch prefigured our
<span id="page_300">p. 300</span> <span id="iv.XV.19-Page_300"></span>
deferred dedication; for though it is indeed already accomplished in
Christ our Head, who so rose again that He shall die no more, and who
was Himself also translated, yet there remains another dedication of the
whole house, of which Christ Himself is the foundation, and this
dedication is deferred till the end, when all shall rise again to die no
more.  And whether it is the house of God, or the temple of God, or the
city of God, that is said to be dedicated, it is all the same, and
equally in accordance with the usage of the Latin language.  For Virgil
himself calls the city of widest empire “the house of Assaracus,” <span
id="fr_827"></span>[828](#fn_827.md) meaning the Romans, who were descended
through the Trojans from Assaracus.  He also calls them the house of
Æneas, because Rome was built by those Trojans who had come to Italy
under Æneas. <span id="fr_828"></span>[829](#fn_828.md)   For that poet
imitated the sacred writings, in which the Hebrew nation, though so
numerous, is called the house of Jacob.
