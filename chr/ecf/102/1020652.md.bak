id="iv.XXI.19-p1.1"></span>Chapter 19.—Of Those Who Promise Impunity
from All Sins Even to Heretics, Through Virtue of Their Participation of
the Body of Christ.</span>

<span id="iv.XXI.19-p2"></span>So, too, there are others who promise
this deliverance from eternal punishment, not, indeed, to all men, but
only to those who have been washed in Christian baptism, and who become
partakers of the body of Christ, no matter how they have lived, or what
heresy or impiety they have fallen into.  They ground this opinion on
the saying of Jesus, “This is the bread which cometh down from heaven,
that if any man eat thereof, he shall not die.  I am the living bread
which came down from heaven.  If a man eat of this bread, he shall live
for ever.” <span id="fr_1532"></span>[1533](#fn_1532.md)   Therefore, say
they, it follows that these persons must be delivered from death
eternal, and at one time or other be introduced to everlasting life.
