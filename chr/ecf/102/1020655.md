<span id="iv.XXI.22-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XXI.22-p1.1"></span>Chapter 22.—Of Those Who Fancy that the Sins
Which are Intermingled with Alms-Deeds Shall Not Be Charged at the Day
of Judgment.</span>

<span id="iv.XXI.22-p2"></span>I have also met with some who are of
opinion that such only as neglect to cover their sins with alms-deeds
shall be punished in everlasting fire; and they cite the words of the
Apostle James, “He shall have judgment without mercy who hath shown no
mercy.” <span id="fr_1536"></span>[1537](#fn_1536)   Therefore, say
they, he who has not amended his ways, but yet has intermingled his
profligate and wicked actions with works of mercy, shall receive mercy
in the judgment, so that he shall either quite escape condemnation, or
shall be liberated from his doom after some time shorter or longer. 
They suppose that this was the reason why the Judge Himself of quick and
dead declined to mention anything else than works of mercy done or
omitted, when awarding to those on His right hand life eternal, and to
those on His left everlasting punishment. <span
id="fr_1537"></span>[1538](#fn_1537)   To the same purpose, they say, is
the daily petition we make in the Lord’s prayer, “Forgive us our debts,
as we forgive our debtors.” <span id="fr_1538"></span>[1539](#fn_1538)  
For, no doubt, whoever pardons the person who has wronged him does a
charitable action.  And this has been so highly commended by the Lord
Himself, that He says, “For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your
heavenly Father will also forgive you:  but if ye forgive not men their
trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.” <span
id="fr_1539"></span>[1540](#fn_1539)   And so it is to this kind of
alms-deeds that the saying of the Apostle James refers, “He shall have
judgment without mercy that hath shown no mercy.”  And our Lord, they
say, made no distinction of great and small sins, but “Your Father will
forgive your sins, if ye forgive men theirs.”  Consequently they
conclude that, though a man has led an abandoned life up to the last day
of it, yet whatsoever his sins have been, they are all remitted by
virtue of this daily prayer, if only he has been mindful to attend to
this one thing, that when they who have done him any injury ask his
pardon, he forgive them from his heart.

<span id="iv.XXI.22-p7"></span>When, by God’s help, I have replied to
all these errors, I shall conclude this (twenty-first) book.
