<span id="iv.XI.17-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XI.17-p1.1"></span>Chapter 17.—That the Flaw of Wickedness is Not
Nature, But Contrary to Nature, and Has Its Origin, Not in the Creator,
But in the Will.</span>

<span id="iv.XI.17-p2"></span>It is with reference to the nature, then,
and not to the wickedness of the devil, that we are to understand these
words, “This is the beginning of God’s handiwork;” <span
id="fr_484"></span>[485](#fn_484.md) for, without doubt, wickedness can be
a flaw or vice <span id="fr_485"></span>[486](#fn_485.md) only where the
nature previously was not vitiated.  Vice, too, is so contrary to
nature, that it cannot but damage it.  And therefore departure from God
would be no vice, unless in a nature whose property it was to abide with
God.  So that even the wicked will is a strong proof of the goodness of
the nature.  But God, as He is the supremely good Creator of good
natures, so is He of evil wills the most just Ruler; so that, while they
make an ill use of good natures, He makes a good use even of evil
wills.  Accordingly, He caused the devil (good by God’s creation, wicked
by his own will) to be cast down from his high position, and to become
the mockery of His angels,—that is, He caused his temptations to benefit
those whom he wishes to injure by them.  And because God, when He
created him, was certainly not ignorant of his future malignity, and
foresaw the good which He Himself would bring out of his evil, therefore
says the psalm, “This leviathan whom Thou hast made to be a sport
therein,” <span id="fr_486"></span>[487](#fn_486.md) that we may see that,
even while God in His goodness created him good, He yet had already
foreseen and arranged how He would make use of him when he became
wicked.
