<span id="iv.XIII.8-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XIII.8-p1.1"></span>Chapter 8.—That the Saints, by Suffering the
First Death for the Truth’s Sake, are Freed from the Second.</span>

<span id="iv.XIII.8-p2"></span>For if we look at the matter a little
more carefully, we shall see that even when a man dies faithfully and
laudably for the truth’s sake, it is still death he is avoiding.  For he
submits to some part of death, for the very purpose of avoiding the
whole, and the second and eternal death over and above.  He submits to
the separation of soul and body, lest the soul be separated both from
God and from the body, and so the whole first death be completed, and
the second death receive him everlastingly.  Wherefore death is indeed,
as I said, good to none while it is being actually suffered, and while
it is subduing the dying to its power; but it is meritoriously endured
for the sake of retaining or winning what *is* good.  And regarding what
happens after death, it is no absurdity to say that death is good to the
good, and evil to the evil.  For the disembodied spirits of the just are
at rest; but those of the wicked suffer punishment till their bodies
rise again,—those of the just to life everlasting, and of the others to
death eternal, which is called the second death.
