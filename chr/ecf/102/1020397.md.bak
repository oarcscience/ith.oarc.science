<span id="iv.XIV.5-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XIV.5-p1.1"></span>Chapter 5.—That the Opinion of the Platonists
Regarding the Nature of Body and Soul is Not So Censurable as that of
the Manichæans, But that Even It is Objectionable, Because It Ascribes
the Origin of Vices to the Nature of The Flesh.</span>

<span id="iv.XIV.5-p2"></span> There is no need, therefore, that in our
sins and vices we accuse the nature of the flesh to the injury of the
Creator, for in its own kind and degree the flesh is good; but to desert
the Creator good, and live according to the created good, is not good,
whether a man choose to live according to the flesh, or according to the
soul, or according to the whole human nature, which is composed of flesh
and soul, and which is therefore spoken of either by the name flesh
alone, or by the name soul alone.  For he who extols the nature of the
soul as the chief good, and condemns the nature of the flesh as if it
were evil, assuredly is fleshly both in his love of the soul and hatred
of the flesh; for these his feelings arise from human fancy, not from
divine truth.  The Platonists, indeed, are not so foolish as, with the
Manichæans, to detest our present bodies as an evil nature; <span
id="fr_658"></span>[659](#fn_658.md) for they attribute all the elements of
which this visible and tangible world is compacted, with all their
qualities, to God their Creator.  Nevertheless, from the death-infected
members and earthly construction of the body they believe the soul is so
affected, that there are thus originated in it the diseases of desires,
and fears, and joy, and sorrow, under which four perturbations, as
Cicero <span id="fr_659"></span>[660](#fn_659.md) calls them, or passions,
as most prefer to name them with the Greeks, is included the whole
viciousness of human life.  But if this be so, how is it that Æneas in
Virgil, when he had heard from his father in Hades that the souls should
return to bodies, expresses surprise at this declaration, and exclaims:

<span id="iv.XIV.5-p5"></span>“O father! and can thought conceive

<span id="iv.XIV.5-p6"></span>That happy souls this realm would leave,

<span id="iv.XIV.5-p7"></span>And seek the upper sky,

<span id="iv.XIV.5-p8"></span>With sluggish clay to reunite?

<span id="iv.XIV.5-p9"></span>This direful longing for the light,

<span id="iv.XIV.5-p10"></span>Whence comes it, say, and why?” <span
id="fr_660"></span>[661](#fn_660.md)

<span id="iv.XIV.5-p12"></span>This direful longing, then, does it still
exist even in that boasted purity of the disembodied spirits, and does
it still proceed from the death-infected members and earthly limbs? 
Does he not assert that, when they begin to long to return to the body,
they have already been delivered from all these so-called pestilences of
the body?  From which we gather that, were this endlessly alternating
purification and defilement of departing and returning souls as true as
it is most certainly false, yet it could not be averred that all
culpable and vicious motions of the soul originate in the earthly body;
for, on their own showing, “this direful longing,” to use the words of
their noble exponent, is so extraneous to the <span id="page_266">p.
266</span> <span id="iv.XIV.5-Page_266"></span> body, that it moves the
soul that is purged of all bodily taint, and is existing apart from any
body whatever, and moves it, moreover, to be embodied again.  So that
even they themselves acknowledge that the soul is not only moved to
desire, fear, joy, sorrow, by the flesh, but that it can also be
agitated with these emotions at its own instance.
