<span id="iv.VII.i-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.VII.i-p2.1"></span>It</span> will be the duty of those who are
endowed with quicker and better understandings, in whose case the former
books are sufficient, and more than sufficient, to effect their intended
object, to bear with me with patience and equanimity whilst I attempt
with more than ordinary diligence to tear up and eradicate depraved and
ancient opinions hostile to the truth of piety, which the long-continued
error of the human race has fixed very deeply in unenlightened minds;
co-operating also in this, according to my little measure, with the
grace of Him who, being the true God, is able to accomplish it, and on
whose help I depend in my work; and, for the sake of others, such should
not deem superfluous what they feel to be no longer necessary for
themselves.  A very great matter is at stake when the true and truly
holy divinity is commended to men as that which they ought to seek after
and to worship; not, however, on account of the transitory vapor of
mortal life, but on account of life eternal, which alone is blessed,
although the help necessary for this frail life we are now living is
also afforded us by it.
