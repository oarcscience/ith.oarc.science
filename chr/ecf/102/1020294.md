<span id="iv.X.23-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.X.23-p1.1"></span>Chapter 23.—Of the Principles Which, According
to the Platonists, Regulate the Purification of the Soul.</span>

<span id="iv.X.23-p2"></span>Even Porphyry asserts that it was revealed
by divine oracles that we are not purified by any sacrifices <span
id="fr_415"></span>[416](#fn_415) to sun or moon, meaning it to be
inferred that we are not purified by sacrificing to any gods.  For what
mysteries can purify, if those of the sun and moon, which are esteemed
the chief of the celestial gods, do not purify?  He says, too, in the
same place, that “principles” can purify, lest it should be supposed,
from his saying that sacrificing to the sun and moon cannot purify, that
sacrificing to some other of the host of gods might do so.  And what he
as a Platonist means by “principles,” we know. <span
id="fr_416"></span>[417](#fn_416)   For he speaks of God the Father and
God the Son, whom he calls (writing in Greek) the intellect or mind of
the Father; <span id="fr_417"></span>[418](#fn_417) but of the Holy
Spirit he says either nothing, or nothing plainly, for I do not
understand what other he speaks of as holding the middle place between
these two.  For if, like Plotinus in his discussion regarding the three
principal substances, <span id="fr_418"></span>[419](#fn_418) he wished
us to understand by this third the soul of nature, he would certainly
not have given it the middle place between these two, that is, between
the Father and the Son.  For Plotinus places the soul of nature after
the intellect of the Father, while Porphyry, making it the mean, does
not place it after, but between the others.  No doubt he spoke according
to his light, or as he thought expedient; but we assert that the Holy
Spirit is the Spirit not of the Father only, nor of the Son only, but of
both.  For philosophers speak as they have a mind to, and in the most
difficult matters do not scruple to offend religious ears; but we are
bound to speak according to a certain rule, lest freedom of speech beget
impiety of opinion about the matters themselves of which we speak.

<span id="iv.X.23-p4"></span> The Platonists of the Alexandrian and
Athenian schools, from Plotinus to Proclus, are at one in recognizing in
God three principles or *hypostases:*  1st, the One or the Good, which
is the Father; 2nd, the Intelligence or Word, which is the Son; 3rd, the
Soul, which is the universal principle of life.  But as to the nature
and order of these *hypostases*, the Alexandrians are no longer at one
with the school of Athens.  On the very subtle differences between the
Trinity of Plotinus and that of Porphyry, consult M. Jules Simon, ii.
110, and M. Vacherot, ii. 37.—<span class="c20"><span
