<span id="iv.ii.vii-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.ii.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 6.—That Not Even the Romans, When
They Took Cities, Spared the Conquered in Their Temples.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.vii-p2"></span>Why, then, need our argument take note of
the many nations who have waged wars with one another, and have nowhere
spared the conquered in the temples of their gods?  Let us look at the
practice of the Romans themselves; let us, I say, recall and review the
Romans, whose chief praise it has been “to spare the vanquished and
subdue the proud,” and that they preferred “rather to forgive than to
revenge an injury;” <span id="fr_45"></span>[46](#fn_45.md) and among so
many and great cities which they have stormed, taken, and overthrown for
the extension of their dominion, let us be told what temples they were
accustomed to exempt, so that whoever took refuge in them was free.  Or
have they really done this, and has the fact been suppressed by the
historians of these events?  Is it to be believed, that men who sought
out with the greatest eagerness points they could praise, would omit
those which, in their own estimation, are the most signal proofs of
piety?  Marcus Marcellus, a distinguished Roman, who took Syracuse, a
most splendidly adorned city, is reported to have bewailed its coming
ruin, and to have shed his own tears over it before he spilt its blood. 
He took steps also to preserve the chastity even of his enemy.  For
before he gave orders for the storming of the city, he issued an edict
forbidding the violation of any free person.  Yet the city was sacked
according to the custom of war; nor do we anywhere read, that even by so
chaste and gentle a commander orders were given that no one should be
injured who had fled to this or that temple.  And this certainly would
by no means have been omitted, when neither his weeping nor his edict
preservative of chastity could be passed in silence.  Fabius, the
conqueror of the city of Tarentum, is praised for abstaining from making
booty of the images.  For when his secretary proposed the question to
him, what he wished done with <span id="page_5">p. 5</span> <span
id="iv.ii.vii-Page_5"></span> the statues of the gods, which had been
taken in large numbers, he veiled his moderation under a joke.  For he
asked of what sort they were; and when they reported to him that there
were not only many large images, but some of them armed, “Oh,” says he,
“let us leave with the Tarentines their angry gods.”  Seeing, then, that
the writers of Roman history could not pass in silence, neither the
weeping of the one general nor the laughing of the other, neither the
chaste pity of the one nor the facetious moderation of the other, on
what occasion would it be omitted, if, for the honor of any of their
enemy’s gods, they had shown this particular form of leniency, that in
any temple slaughter or captivity was prohibited?
