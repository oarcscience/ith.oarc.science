<span id="iv.XIX.19-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XIX.19-p1.1"></span>Chapter 19.—Of the Dress and Habits of the
Christian People.</span>

<span id="iv.XIX.19-p2"></span>It is a matter of no moment in the city
of God whether he who adopts the faith that brings men to God adopts it
in one dress and manner of life or another, so long only as he lives in
conformity with the commandments of God.  And hence, when philosophers
themselves become Christians, they are compelled, indeed, to abandon
their erroneous doctrines, but not their dress and mode of living, which
are no obstacle to religion.  So that we make no account of that
distinction of sects which Varro adduced in connection with the Cynic
school, provided always nothing indecent or self-indulgent is retained. 
As to these three modes of life, the contemplative, the active, and the
composite, although, so long as a man’s faith is preserved, he may
choose any of them without detriment to his eternal interests, yet he
must never overlook the claims of truth and duty.  No man has a right to
lead such a life of contemplation as to forget in his own ease the
service due to his neighbor; nor has any man a right to be so immersed
in active life as to neglect the contemplation of God.  The charm of
leisure must not be indolent vacancy of mind, but the investigation or
discovery of truth, that thus every man may make solid attainments
without grudging that others do the same.  And, in active life, it is
not the honors or power of this life we should covet, since all things
under the sun are vanity, but we should aim at using our position and
influence, if these have been honorably attained, for the welfare of
those who are under us, in the way we have already explained. <span
id="fr_1292"></span>[1293](#fn_1292.md)   It is to this the apostle refers
when he says, “He that desireth the episcopate desireth a good
work.” <span id="fr_1293"></span>[1294](#fn_1293.md)   He wished to show
that the episcopate is the title of a work, not of an honor.  It is a
Greek word, and signifies that he who governs superintends or takes care
of those whom he governs:  for <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.XIX.19-p4.2"></span>ἐπί</span> means *over*, and <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.XIX.19-p4.3"></span> σκοπεῖν</span>, *to
see*; therefore <span class="Greek"><span id="iv.XIX.19-p4.4"></span>
ἐπισκοπεῖν</span> means “to oversee.” <span
id="fr_1294"></span>[1295](#fn_1294.md)   So that he who loves to govern
rather than to do good is no bishop.  Accordingly no one is prohibited
from the search <span id="page_414">p. 414</span> <span
id="iv.XIX.19-Page_414"></span> after truth, for in this leisure may
most laudably be spent; but it is unseemly to covet the high position
requisite for governing the people, even though that position be held
and that government be administered in a seemly manner.  And therefore
holy leisure is longed for by the love of truth; but it is the necessity
of love to undertake requisite business.  If no one imposes this burden
upon us, we are free to sift and contemplate truth; but if it be laid
upon us, we are necessitated for love’s sake to undertake it.  And yet
not even in this case are we obliged wholly to relinquish the sweets of
contemplation; for were these to be withdrawn, the burden might prove
more than we could bear.
