<span id="iv.XXII.17-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XXII.17-p1.1"></span>Chapter 17.—Whether the Bodies of Women
Shall Retain Their Own Sex in the Resurrection.</span>

<span id="iv.XXII.17-p2"></span>From the words, “Till we all come to a
perfect man, to the measure of the age of the fullness of Christ,” <span
id="fr_1633"></span>[1634](#fn_1633.md) and from the words, “Conformed to
the image of the Son of God,” <span id="fr_1634"></span>[1635](#fn_1634.md)
some conclude that women shall not rise women, but that all shall be
men, because <span id="page_496">p. 496</span> <span
id="iv.XXII.17-Page_496"></span> God made man only of earth, and woman
of the man.  For my part, they seem to be wiser who make no doubt that
both sexes shall rise.  For there shall be no lust, which is now the
cause of confusion.  For before they sinned, the man and the woman were
naked, and were not ashamed.  From those bodies, then, vice shall be
withdrawn, while nature shall be preserved.  And the sex of woman is not
a vice, but nature.  It shall then indeed be superior to carnal
intercourse and child-bearing; nevertheless the female members shall
remain adapted not to the old uses, but to a new beauty, which, so far
from provoking lust, now extinct, shall excite praise to the wisdom and
clemency of God, who both made what was not and delivered from
corruption what He made.  For at the beginning of the human race the
woman was made of a rib taken from the side of the man while he slept;
for it seemed fit that even then Christ and His Church should be
foreshadowed in this event.  For that sleep of the man was the death of
Christ, whose side, as He hung lifeless upon the cross, was pierced with
a spear, and there flowed from it blood and water, and these we know to
be the sacraments by which the Church is “built up.”  For Scripture used
this very word, not saying “He formed” or “framed,” but “built her up
into a woman;” <span id="fr_1635"></span>[1636](#fn_1635.md) whence also
the apostle speaks of the *edification* of the body of Christ, <span
id="fr_1636"></span>[1637](#fn_1636.md) which is the Church.  The woman,
therefore, is a creature of God even as the man; but by her creation
from man unity is commended; and the manner of her creation prefigured,
as has been said, Christ and the Church.  He, then, who created both
sexes will restore both.  Jesus Himself also, when asked by the
Sadducees, who denied the resurrection, which of the seven brothers
should have to wife the woman whom all in succession had taken to raise
up seed to their brother, as the law enjoined, says, “Ye do err, not
knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God.” <span
id="fr_1637"></span>[1638](#fn_1637.md)   And though it was a fit
opportunity for His saying, She about whom you make inquiries shall
herself be a man, and not a woman, He said nothing of the kind; but “In
the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are
as the angels of God in heaven.” <span
id="fr_1638"></span>[1639](#fn_1638.md)   They shall be equal to the angels
in immortality and happiness, not in flesh, nor in resurrection, which
the angels did not need, because they could not die.  The Lord then
denied that there would be in the resurrection, not women, but
marriages; and He uttered this denial in circumstances in which the
question mooted would have been more easily and speedily solved by
denying that the female sex would exist, if this had in truth been
foreknown by Him.  But, indeed, He even affirmed that the sex should
exist by saying, “They shall not be given in marriage,” which can only
apply to females; “Neither shall they marry,” which applies to males. 
There shall therefore be those who are in this world accustomed to marry
and be given in marriage, only they shall there make no such marriages.
