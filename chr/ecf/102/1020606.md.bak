<span id="iv.XX.4-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XX.4-p1.1"></span>Chapter 4.—That Proofs of the Last Judgment
Will Be Adduced, First from the New Testament, and Then from the
Old.</span>

<span id="iv.XX.4-p2"></span>The proofs, then, of this last judgment of
God which I propose to adduce shall be drawn first from the New
Testament, and then from the Old.  For although the Old Testament is
prior in point of time, the New has the precedence in intrinsic value;
for the Old acts the part of herald to the New.  We shall therefore
first cite passages from the New Testament, and confirm them by
quotations from the Old Testament.  The Old contains the law and the
prophets, the New the gospel and the apostolic epistles.  Now the
apostle says “By the law is the knowledge of sin.  But now the
righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by
the law and the prophets; now the righteousness of God is by faith of
Jesus Christ upon all them that believe.” <span
id="fr_1320"></span>[1321](#fn_1320.md)   This righteousness of God belongs
to the New Testament, and evidence for it exists in the old books, that
is to say, in the law and the prophets.  I shall first, then state the
case, and then call the witnesses.  This order Jesus Christ Himself
directs us to observe, saying, “The scribe instructed in the kingdom of
God is like a good householder, bringing out of his treasure things new
and old.” <span id="fr_1321"></span>[1322](#fn_1321.md)   He did not say
“old and new,” which He certainly would have said had He not wished to
follow the order of merit rather than that of time.
