id="iv.XVIII.20-p1.1"></span>Chapter 20.—Of the Succession of the Line
of Kings Among the Israelites After the Times of the Judges.</span>

<span id="iv.XVIII.20-p2"></span>While these kings reigned in the places
mentioned, the period of the judges being ended, the kingdom of Israel
next began with king Saul, when Samuel the prophet lived.  At that date
those Latin kings began who were surnamed Silvii, having that surname,
in addition to their proper name, from their predecessor, that son of
Æneas who was called Silvius; just as, long afterward, the successors of
Cæsar Augustus were surnamed Cæsars.  Saul being rejected, so that none
of his issue should reign, on his death David succeeded him in the
kingdom, after he had reigned forty years.  Then the Athenians ceased to
have kings after the death of Codrus, and began to have a magistracy to
rule the republic.  After David, who also reigned forty years, his son
Solomon was king of Israel, who built that most noble temple of God at
Jerusalem.  In his time Alba was built among the Latins, from which
thereafter the kings began to be styled kings not of the Latins, but of
the Albans, although in the same Latium.  Solomon was succeeded by his
son Rehoboam, under whom that people was divided into two kingdoms, and
its separate parts began to have separate kings.
