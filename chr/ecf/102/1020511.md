<span id="iv.XVII.18"></span>

<span id="iv.XVII.18-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XVII.18-p1.1"></span>Chapter 18.—Of the 3d, 41st, 15th, and 68th
Psalms, in Which the Death and Resurrection of the Lord are
Prophesied.</span>

<span id="iv.XVII.18-p2"></span>About His resurrection also the oracles
of the Psalms are by no means silent.  For what else is it that is sung
in His person in the 3d Psalm, “I laid me down and took a sleep, \[and\]
I awaked, for the Lord shall sustain me?” <span
id="fr_1096"></span>[1097](#fn_1096)   Is there perchance any one so
stupid as to believe that the prophet chose to point it out to us as
something great that He had slept and risen up, unless that sleep had
been death, and that awaking the resurrection, which behoved to be thus
prophesied concerning Christ?  For in the 41st Psalm also it is shown
much more clearly, where in the person of the Mediator, in the usual
way, things are narrated as if past which were prophesied as yet to
come, since these things which were yet to come were in the
predestination and foreknowledge of God as if they were done, because
they were certain.  He says, “Mine enemies speak evil of me; When shall
he die, and his name perish?  And if he came in to see me, his heart
spake vain things:  he gathered iniquity to himself.  He went out of
doors, and uttered it all at once.  Against me all mine enemies whisper
together:  against me do they devise evil.  They have planned an unjust
thing against me.  Shall not he that sleeps also rise again?” <span
id="fr_1097"></span>[1098](#fn_1097)   These words are certainly so set
down here that he may be understood to say nothing else than if he said,
Shall not He that died recover life again?  The previous words clearly
show that His enemies have mediated and planned His death, and that this
was executed by him who came <span id="page_356">p. 356</span> <span
id="iv.XVII.18-Page_356"></span> in to see, and went out to betray.  But
to whom does not Judas here occur, who, from being His disciple, became
His betrayer?  Therefore because they were about to do what they had
plotted,—that is, were about to kill Him,—he, to show them that with
useless malice they were about to kill Him who should rise again, so
adds this verse, as if he said, What vain thing are you doing?  What
will be your crime will be my sleep.  “Shall not He that sleeps also
rise again?”  And yet he indicates in the following verses that they
should not commit so great an impiety with impunity, saying, “Yea, the
man of my peace in whom I trusted, who ate my bread, hath enlarged the
heel over me;” <span id="fr_1098"></span>[1099](#fn_1098) that is, hath
trampled me under foot.  “But Thou,” he saith, “O Lord, be merciful unto
me, and raise me up, that I may requite them.” <span
id="fr_1099"></span>[1100](#fn_1099)   Who can now deny this who sees
the Jews, after the passion and resurrection of Christ, utterly rooted
up from their abodes by warlike slaughter and destruction?  For, being
slain by them, He has risen again, and has requited them meanwhile by
temporary discipline, save that for those who are not corrected He keeps
it in store for the time when He shall judge the quick and the
dead. <span id="fr_1100"></span>[1101](#fn_1100)   For the Lord Jesus
Himself, in pointing out that very man to the apostles as His betrayer,
quoted this very verse of this psalm, and said it was fulfilled in
Himself:  “He that ate my bread enlarged the heel over me.”  But what he
says, “In whom I trusted,” does not suit the head but the body.  For the
Saviour Himself was not ignorant of him concerning whom He had already
said before, “One of you is a devil.” <span
id="fr_1101"></span>[1102](#fn_1101)   But He is wont to assume the
person of His members, and to ascribe to Himself what should be said of
them, because the head and the body is one Christ; <span
id="fr_1102"></span>[1103](#fn_1102) whence that saying in the Gospel,
“I was an hungered, and ye gave me to eat.” <span
id="fr_1103"></span>[1104](#fn_1103)   Expounding which, He says, “Since
ye did it to one of the least of mine, ye did it to me.” <span
id="fr_1104"></span>[1105](#fn_1104)   Therefore He said that He had
trusted, because his disciples then had trusted concerning Judas; for he
was numbered with the apostles. <span
id="fr_1105"></span>[1106](#fn_1105)

<span id="iv.XVII.18-p13"></span>But the Jews do not expect that the
Christ whom they expect will die; therefore they do not think ours to be
Him whom the law and the prophets announced, but feign to themselves I
know not whom of their own, exempt from the suffering of death. 
Therefore, with wonderful emptiness and blindness, they contend that the
words we have set down signify, not death and resurrection, but sleep
and awaking again.  But the 16th Psalm also cries to them, “Therefore my
heart is jocund, and my tongue hath exulted; moreover, my flesh also
shall rest in hope:  for Thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither
wilt Thou give Thine Holy One to see corruption.” <span
id="fr_1106"></span>[1107](#fn_1106)   Who but He that rose again the
third day could say his flesh had rested in this hope; that His soul,
not being left in hell, but speedily returning to it, should revive it,
that it should not be corrupted as corpses are wont to be, which they
can in no wise say of David the prophet and king?  The 68th Psalm also
cries out, “Our God is the God of Salvation:  even of the Lord the exit
was by death.” <span id="fr_1107"></span>[1108](#fn_1107)   What could
be more openly said?  For the God of salvation is the Lord Jesus, which
is interpreted Saviour, or Healing One.  For this reason this name was
given, when it was said before He was born of the virgin:  “Thou shall
bring forth a Son, and shalt call His name Jesus; for He shall save His
people from their sins.” <span id="fr_1108"></span>[1109](#fn_1108)  
Because His blood was shed for the remission of their sins, it behoved
Him to have no other exit from this life than death.  Therefore, when it
had been said, “Our God is the God of salvation,” immediately it was
added, “Even of the Lord the exit was by death,” in order to show that
we were to be saved by His dying.  But that saying is marvellous, “Even
of the Lord,” as if it was said, Such is that life of mortals, that not
even the Lord Himself could go out of it otherwise save through death.
