<span id="iv.IX.16-p1"></span><span class="c45"><span
id="iv.IX.16-p1.1"></span>Chapter</span> <span class="c2"><span
id="iv.IX.16-p1.2"></span> 16.—Whether It is Reasonable in the
Platonists to Determine that the Celestial Gods Decline Contact with
Earthly Things and Intercourse with Men, Who Therefore Require the
Intercession of the Demons.</span>

<span id="iv.IX.16-p2"></span>That opinion, which the same Platonist
avers that Plato uttered, is not true, “that no god holds intercourse
with men.” <span id="fr_351"></span>[352](#fn_351.md)   And this, he says,
is the chief evidence of their exaltation, that they are never
contaminated by contact with men.  He admits, therefore, that the demons
are contaminated; and it follows that they cannot cleanse those by whom
they are themselves contaminated, and thus all alike become impure, the
demons by associating with men, and men by worshipping the demons.  Or,
if they say that the demons are not contaminated by associating and
dealing with men, then they are better than the gods, for the gods, were
they to do so, would be contaminated.  For this, we are told, is the
glory of the gods, that they are so highly exalted that no human
intercourse can sully them.  He affirms, indeed, that the supreme God,
the Creator of all things, whom we call the true God, is spoken of by
Plato as the only God whom the poverty of human speech fails even
passably to describe; and that even the wise, when their mental energy
is as far as <span id="page_175">p. 175</span> <span
id="iv.IX.16-Page_175"></span> possible delivered from the trammels of
connection with the body, have only such gleams of insight into His
nature as may be compared to a flash of lightning illumining the
darkness.  If, then, this supreme God, who is truly exalted above all
things, does nevertheless visit the minds of the wise, when emancipated
from the body, with an intelligible and ineffable presence, though this
be only occasional, and as it were a swift flash of light athwart the
darkness, why are the other gods so sublimely removed from all contact
with men, as if they would be polluted by it? as if it were not a
sufficient refutation of this to lift up our eyes to those heavenly
bodies which give the earth its needful light.  If the stars, though
they, by his account, are visible gods, are not contaminated when we
look at them, neither are the demons contaminated when men see them
quite closely.  But perhaps it is the human voice, and not the eye,
which pollutes the gods; and therefore the demons are appointed to
mediate and carry men’s utterances to the gods, who keep themselves
remote through fear of pollution?  What am I to say of the other
senses?  For by smell neither the demons, who are present, nor the gods,
though they were present and inhaling the exhalations of living men,
would be polluted if they are not contaminated with the effluvia of the
carcasses offered in sacrifice.  As for taste, they are pressed by no
necessity of repairing bodily decay, so as to be reduced to ask food
from men.  And touch is in their own power.  For while it may seem that
contact is so called, because the sense of touch is specially concerned
in it, yet the gods, if so minded, might mingle with men, so as to see
and be seen, hear and be heard; and where is the need of touching?  For
men would not dare to desire this, if they were favored with the sight
or conversation of gods or good demons; and if through excessive
curiosity they should desire it, how could they accomplish their wish
without the consent of the god or demon, when they cannot touch so much
as a sparrow unless it be caged?

<span id="iv.IX.16-p4"></span>There is, then, nothing to hinder the gods
from mingling in a bodily form with men, from seeing and being seen,
from speaking and hearing.  And if the demons do thus mix with men, as I
said, and are not polluted, while the gods, were they to do so, should
be polluted, then the demons are less liable to pollution than the
gods.  And if even the demons are contaminated, how can they help men to
attain blessedness after death, if, so far from being able to cleanse
them, and present them clean to the unpolluted gods, these mediators are
themselves polluted?  And if they cannot confer this benefit on men,
what good can their friendly mediation do?  Or shall its result be, not
that men find entrance to the gods, but that men and demons abide
together in a state of pollution, and consequently of exclusion from
blessedness?  Unless, perhaps, some one may say that, like sponges or
things of that sort, the demons themselves, in the process of cleansing
their friends, become themselves the filthier in proportion as the
others become clean.  But if this is the solution, then the gods, who
shun contact or intercourse with men for fear of pollution, mix with
demons who are far more polluted.  Or perhaps the gods, who cannot
cleanse men without polluting themselves, can without pollution cleanse
the demons who have been contaminated by human contact?  Who can believe
such follies, unless the demons have practised their deceit upon him? 
If seeing and being seen is contamination, and if the gods, whom
Apuleius himself calls visible, “the brilliant lights of the
world,” <span id="fr_352"></span>[353](#fn_352.md) and the other stars, are
seen by men, are we to believe that the demons, who cannot be seen
unless they please, are safer from contamination?  Or if it is only the
seeing and not the being seen which contaminates, then they must deny
that these gods of theirs, these brilliant lights of the world, see men
when their rays beam upon the earth.  Their rays are not contaminated by
lighting on all manner of pollution, and are we to suppose that the gods
would be contaminated if they mixed with men, and even if contact were
needed in order to assist them?  For there is contact between the earth
and the sun’s or moon’s rays, and yet this does not pollute the light.
