<span id="iv.XIV.2-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XIV.2-p1.1"></span>Chapter 2.—Of Carnal Life, Which is to Be
Understood Not Only of Living in Bodily Indulgence, But Also of Living
in the Vices of the Inner Man.</span>

<span id="iv.XIV.2-p2"></span>First, we must see what it is to live
after the flesh, and what to live after the spirit.  For any one who
either does not recollect, or does not sufficiently weigh, the language
of sacred Scripture, may, on first hearing what we have said, suppose
that the Epicurean philosophers live after the flesh, because they place
man’s highest good in bodily pleasure; and that those others do so who
have been of opinion that in some form or other bodily good is man’s
supreme good; and that the mass of men do so who, without dogmatizing or
philosophizing on the subject, are so prone to lust that they cannot
delight in any pleasure save such as they receive from bodily
sensations:  and he may suppose that the Stoics, who place the supreme
good of men in the soul, live after the spirit; for what is man’s soul,
if not spirit?  But in the sense of the divine Scripture both are proved
to live after the flesh.  For by flesh it means not only the body of a
terrestrial and mortal animal, as when it says, “All flesh is not the
same flesh, but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of
beasts, another of fishes, another of <span id="page_263">p. 263</span>
<span id="iv.XIV.2-Page_263"></span> birds,” <span
id="fr_638"></span>[639](#fn_638.md) but it uses this word in many other
significations; and among these various usages, a frequent one is to use
flesh for man himself, the nature of man taking the part for the whole,
as in the words, “By the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be
justified;” <span id="fr_639"></span>[640](#fn_639.md) for what does he
mean here by “no flesh” but “no man?”  And this, indeed, he shortly
after says more plainly:  “No man shall be justified by the law;” <span
id="fr_640"></span>[641](#fn_640.md) and in the Epistle to the Galatians,
“Knowing that man is not justified by the works of the law.”  And so we
understand the words, “And the Word was made flesh,” <span
id="fr_641"></span>[642](#fn_641.md) —that is, man, which some not
accepting in its right sense, have supposed that Christ had not a human
soul. <span id="fr_642"></span>[643](#fn_642.md)   For as the whole is used
for the part in the words of Mary Magdalene in the Gospel, “They have
taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid Him,” <span
id="fr_643"></span>[644](#fn_643.md) by which she meant only the flesh of
Christ, which she supposed had been taken from the tomb where it had
been buried, so the part is used for the whole, flesh being named, while
man is referred to, as in the quotations above cited.

<span id="iv.XIV.2-p9"></span>Since, then, Scripture uses the word flesh
in many ways, which there is not time to collect and investigate, if we
are to ascertain what it is to live after the flesh (which is certainly
evil, though the nature of flesh is not itself evil), we must carefully
examine that passage of the epistle which the Apostle Paul wrote to the
Galatians, in which he says, “Now the works of the flesh are manifest,
which are these:  adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,
idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife,
seditions, heresies, envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and
such like:  of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in
time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom
of God.” <span id="fr_644"></span>[645](#fn_644.md)   This whole passage of
the apostolic epistle being considered, so far as it bears on the matter
in hand, will be sufficient to answer the question, what it is to live
after the flesh.  For among the works of the flesh which he said were
manifest, and which he cited for condemnation, we find not only those
which concern the pleasure of the flesh, as fornications, uncleanness,
lasciviousness, drunkenness, revellings, but also those which, though
they be remote from fleshly pleasure, reveal the vices of the soul.  For
who does not see that idolatries, witchcrafts, hatreds, variance,
emulations, wrath, strife, heresies, envyings, are vices rather of the
soul than of the flesh?  For it is quite possible for a man to abstain
from fleshly pleasures for the sake of idolatry or some heretical error;
and yet, even when he does so, he is proved by this apostolic authority
to be living after the flesh; and in abstaining from fleshly pleasure,
he is proved to be practising damnable works of the flesh.  Who that has
enmity has it not in his soul? or who would say to his enemy, or to the
man he thinks his enemy, You have a bad flesh towards me, and not
rather, You have a bad spirit towards me?  In fine, if any one heard of
what I may call “carnalities,” he would not fail to attribute them to
the carnal part of man; so no one doubts that “animosities” belong to
the soul of man.  Why then does the doctor of the Gentiles in faith and
verity call all these and similar things works of the flesh, unless
because, by that mode of speech whereby the part is used for the whole,
he means us to understand by the word flesh the man himself?
