<span id="iv.XI.33-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XI.33-p1.1"></span>Chapter 33.—Of the Two Different and
Dissimilar Communities of Angels, Which are Not Inappropriately
Signified by the Names Light and Darkness.</span>

<span id="iv.XI.33-p2"></span>That certain angels sinned, and were
thrust down to the lowest parts of this world, where they are, as it
were, incarcerated till their final damnation in the day of judgment,
the Apostle Peter very plainly declares, when he says that “God spared
not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered
them into chains of darkness to be reserved into judgment.” <span
id="fr_514"></span>[515](#fn_514)   Who, then, can doubt that God,
either in foreknowledge or in act, separated between these and the
rest?  And who will dispute that the rest are justly called “light?” 
For even we who are yet living by faith, hoping only and not yet
enjoying equality with them, are already called “light” by the apostle: 
“For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the
Lord.” <span id="fr_515"></span>[516](#fn_515)   But as for these
apostate angels, all who understand or believe them to be worse than
unbelieving men are well aware that they are called “darkness.” 
Wherefore, though light and darkness are to be taken in their literal
signification in these passages of Genesis in which it is said, “God
said, Let there be light, and there was light,” and “God divided the
light from the darkness,” yet, for our part, we understand these two
societies of angels,—the one enjoying God, the other swelling with
pride; the one to whom it is said, “Praise ye Him, all His
angels,” <span id="fr_516"></span>[517](#fn_516) the other whose prince
says, “All these things will I give Thee if Thou wilt fall down and
worship me;” <span id="fr_517"></span>[518](#fn_517) the one blazing
with the holy love of God, the other reeking with the unclean lust of
self-advancement.  And since, as it is written, “God resisteth the
proud, but giveth grace unto the humble,” <span
id="fr_518"></span>[519](#fn_518) we may say, the one dwelling in the
heaven of heavens, the other cast thence, and raging through the lower
regions of the air; the one tranquil in the brightness of piety, the
other tempest-tossed with beclouding desires; the one, at God’s
pleasure, tenderly succoring, justly avenging,—the other, set on by its
own pride, boiling with the lust of subduing and hurting; the one the
minister of God’s goodness to the utmost of their good pleasure, the
other held in by God’s power from doing the harm it would; the former
laughing at the latter when it does good unwillingly by its
persecutions, the latter envying the former when it gathers in its
pilgrims.  These two angelic communities, then, dissimilar and contrary
to one another, the one both by nature good and by will upright, the
other also good by nature but by will depraved, as they are exhibited in
other and more explicit passages of holy writ, so I think they are
spoken of in this book of Genesis under the names of light and darkness;
and even if the author perhaps had a different meaning, yet our
discussion of the obscure language has not been wasted time; for, though
we have been unable to discover his meaning, yet we have adhered to the
rule of faith, which is sufficiently ascertained by the faithful from
other passages of equal authority.  For, though it is the material works
of God which are here spoken of, they have certainly a resemblance to
the spiritual, so that Paul can say, “Ye are all the children of light,
and the children of the day:  we are not of the night, nor of
darkness.” <span id="fr_519"></span>[520](#fn_519)   If, on the other
hand, the author of Genesis saw in the words what we see, then our
discussion reaches this more satisfactory conclusion, that the man of
God, so eminently and divinely wise, or rather, that the Spirit of God
who by him recorded God’s works which were finished on the sixth day,
may be supposed not to have omitted all mention of the angels whether he
included them in the words “in the beginning,” because He made them
first, or, which seems most likely, because He made them in the
only-begotten Word.  And, under these names heaven and earth, the whole
creation is signified, either as divided into spiritual and material,
which seems the more likely, or into the two great parts of the world in
which all created things are contained, so that, first of all, the
creation is presented in sum, and <span id="page_225">p. 225</span>
<span id="iv.XI.33-Page_225"></span> then its parts are enumerated
according to the mystic number of the days.
