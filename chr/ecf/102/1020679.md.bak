<span id="iv.XXII.18-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XXII.18-p1.1"></span>Chapter 18.—Of the Perfect Man, that Is,
Christ; And of His Body, that Is, The Church, Which is His
Fullness.</span>

<span id="iv.XXII.18-p2"></span>To understand what the apostle means
when he says that we shall all come to a perfect man, we must consider
the connection of the whole passage, which runs thus:  “He that
descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that
He might fill all things.  And He gave some, apostles; and some,
prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; for the
perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying
of the body of Christ:  till we all come to the unity of the faith and
knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the age
of the fullness of Christ:  that we henceforth be no more children,
tossed and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of
men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive; but,
speaking the truth in love, may grow up in Him in all things, which is
the Head, even Christ:  from whom the whole body fitly joined together
and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the
effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the
body, unto the edifying of itself in love.” <span
id="fr_1639"></span>[1640](#fn_1639.md)   Behold what the perfect man
is—the head and the body, which is made up of all the members, which in
their own time shall be perfected.  But new additions are daily being
made to this body while the Church is being built up, to which it is
said, “Ye are the body of Christ and His members;” <span
id="fr_1640"></span>[1641](#fn_1640.md) and again, “For His body’s sake,”
he says, “which is the Church;” <span
id="fr_1641"></span>[1642](#fn_1641.md) and again, “We being many are one
head, one body.” <span id="fr_1642"></span>[1643](#fn_1642.md)   It is of
the edification of this body that it is here, too, said, “For the
perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the
edification of the body of Christ;” and then that passage of which we
are now speaking is <span id="page_497">p. 497</span> <span
id="iv.XXII.18-Page_497"></span> added, “Till we all come to the unity
of the faith and knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the
measure of the age of the fullness of Christ,” and so on.  And he shows
of what body we are to understand this to be the measure, when he says,
“That we may grow up into Him in all things, which is the Head, even
Christ:  from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by
that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in
the measure of every part.”  As, therefore, there is a measure of every
part, so there is a measure of the fullness of the whole body which is
made up of all its parts, and it is of this measure it is said, “To the
measure of the age of the fullness of Christ.”  This fullness he spoke
of also in the place where he says of Christ, “And gave Him to be the
Head over all things to the Church, <span
id="fr_1643"></span>[1644](#fn_1643.md) which is His body, the fullness of
Him that filleth all in all.” <span id="fr_1644"></span>[1645](#fn_1644.md)
  But even if this should be referred to the form in which each one
shall rise, what should hinder us from applying to the woman what is
expressly said of the man, understanding both sexes to be included under
the general term “man?”  For certainly in the saying, “Blessed is he who
feareth the Lord,” <span id="fr_1645"></span>[1646](#fn_1645.md) women also
who fear the Lord are included.
