<span id="iv.ii.xii-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.ii.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 11.—Of the End of This Life, Whether
It is Material that It Be Long Delayed.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.xii-p2"></span>But, it is added, many Christians were
slaughtered, and were put to death in a hideous <span id="page_9">p.
9</span> <span id="iv.ii.xii-Page_9"></span> variety of cruel ways. 
Well, if this be hard to bear, it is assuredly the common lot of all who
are born into this life.  Of this at least I am certain, that no one has
ever died who was not destined to die some time.  Now the end of life
puts the longest life on a par with the shortest.  For of two things
which have alike ceased to be, the one is not better, the other
worse—the one greater, the other less. <span
id="fr_59"></span>[60](#fn_59.md)   And of what consequence is it what kind
of death puts an end to life, since he who has died once is not forced
to go through the same ordeal a second time?  And as in the daily
casualties of life every man is, as it were, threatened with numberless
deaths, so long as it remains uncertain which of them is his fate, I
would ask whether it is not better to suffer one and die, than to live
in fear of all?  I am not unaware of the poor-spirited fear which
prompts us to choose rather to live long in fear of so many deaths, than
to die once and so escape them all; but the weak and cowardly shrinking
of the flesh is one thing, and the well-considered and reasonable
persuasion of the soul quite another.  That death is not to be judged an
evil which is the end of a good life; for death becomes evil only by the
retribution which follows it.  They, then, who are destined to die, need
not be careful to inquire what death they are to die, but into what
place death will usher them.  And since Christians are well aware that
the death of the godly pauper whose sores the dogs licked was far better
than of the wicked rich man who lay in purple and fine linen, what harm
could these terrific deaths do to the dead who had lived well?

<span id="iv.ii.xii-p3"></span> Much of a kindred nature might be
gathered from the Stoics.  Antoninus says (ii. 14):  “Though thou
shouldest be going to live 3000 years, and as many times 10,000 years,
still remember that no man loses any other life than this which he now
lives, nor lives any other than this which he now loses.  The longest
and the shortest are thus brought to the same.”
