id="iv.XIII.17-p1.1"></span>Chapter 17.—Against Those Who Affirm that
Earthly Bodies Cannot Be Made Incorruptible and Eternal.</span>

<span id="iv.XIII.17-p2"></span>These same philosophers further contend
that terrestrial bodies cannot be eternal though they make no doubt that
the whole earth, which is itself the central member of their god,—not,
indeed, of the greatest, but yet of a great god, that is, of this whole
world,—is eternal.  Since, then, the Supreme made for them another god,
that is, this world, superior to the other gods beneath Him; and since
they suppose that this god is an animal, having, as they affirm, a
rational or intellectual soul enclosed in the huge mass of its body, and
having, as the fitly situated and adjusted members of its body, the four
elements, whose union they wish to be indissoluble and eternal, lest
perchance this great god of theirs might some day perish; what reason is
there that the earth, which is the central member in the body of a
greater creature, should be eternal, and the bodies of other terrestrial
creatures should not possibly be eternal if God should so will it?  But
earth, say they, must return to earth, out of which the terrestrial
bodies of the animals have been taken.  For this, they say, is the
reason of the necessity of their death and dissolution, and this the
manner of their restoration to the solid and eternal earth whence they
came.  But if any one says the same thing of fire, holding that the
bodies which are derived from it to make celestial beings must be
restored to the universal fire, does not the immortality which Plato
represents these gods as receiving from the Supreme evanesce in the heat
of this dispute?  Or does this not happen with those celestials because
God, whose will, as Plato says, overpowers all powers, has willed it
should not be so?  What, then, hinders God from ordaining the same of
terrestrial bodies?  And since, indeed, Plato acknowledges that God can
prevent things that are born from dying, and things that are joined from
being sundered, and things that are composed from being dissolved, and
can ordain that the souls once allotted to their bodies should never
abandon them, but enjoy along with them immortality and everlasting
bliss, why may He not also effect that terrestrial bodies die not?  Is
God powerless to do everything that is special to the Christian’s creed,
but powerful to effect everything the Platonists desire?  The
philosophers, forsooth, have been admitted to a knowledge of the divine
purposes and power which has been denied to the prophets!  The truth is,
that the Spirit of God taught His prophets so much of His will as He
thought fit to reveal, but the philosophers, in their efforts to
discover it, were deceived by human conjecture.

<span id="iv.XIII.17-p3"></span>But they should not have been so led
astray, I will not say by their ignorance, but by their obstinacy, as to
contradict themselves so frequently; for they maintain, with all their
vaunted might, that in order to the happiness of the soul, it must
abandon not only its earthly body, but every kind of body.  And yet they
hold that the gods, whose souls are most blessed, are bound to
everlasting bodies, the celestials to fiery bodies, and the soul of Jove
himself (or this world, as they would have us believe) to all the
physical elements which compose this entire mass reaching from earth to
heaven.  For this soul Plato believes to be extended and diffused by
musical numbers, <span id="fr_600"></span>[601](#fn_600.md) from the middle
of the inside of the earth, which geometricians call the centre,
outwards through all its parts to the utmost heights and extremities of
the heavens; so that this world is a very great and blessed immortal
animal, whose soul has both the perfect blessedness of wisdom, and never
leaves its own body and whose body has life everlasting from the soul,
and by no means clogs or hinders it, though itself be not a simple body,
but compacted of so many and so huge materials.  Since, therefore, they
allow so much to their own conjectures, why do they refuse to believe
that by the divine will and power immortality can be conferred on
earthly bodies, in which the souls would be neither oppressed with the
burden of them, nor separated from them by any death, but live eternally
and blessedly?  Do they not assert that their own gods so live in bodies
of fire, and that Jove himself, their king, so lives in the physical
elements?  If, in order to its blessedness, the soul must quit every
kind of body, let their gods flit from the starry spheres, and Jupiter
from earth to sky; or, if they cannot do so, let them be pronounced
miserable.  But neither alternative will these men adopt.  For, on the
one hand, they dare not ascribe to their own gods a departure from the
body, lest they should seem to worship mortals; on the other hand, they
dare not deny their happiness, lest they should acknowledge wretches as
gods.  Therefore, to obtain blessedness, we need not quit every kind of
body, but only the corruptible, cumbersome, painful, dying,—not such
bodies <span id="page_254">p. 254</span> <span
id="iv.XIII.17-Page_254"></span> as the goodness of God contrived for
the first man, but such only as man’s sin entailed.
