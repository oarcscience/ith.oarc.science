<span id="iv.XX.25-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XX.25-p1.1"></span>Chapter 25.—Of Malachi’s Prophecy, in Which He
Speaks of the Last Judgment, and of a Cleansing Which Some are to
Undergo by Purifying Punishments.</span>

<span id="iv.XX.25-p2"></span>The prophet Malachi or Malachias, who is
also called Angel, and is by some (for Jerome <span
id="fr_1455"></span>[1456](#fn_1455) tells us that this is the opinion
of the Hebrews) identified with Ezra the priest, <span
id="fr_1456"></span>[1457](#fn_1456) others of whose writings have been
received into the canon, predicts the last judgment, saying, “Behold, He
cometh, saith the Lord Almighty; and who shall abide the day of His
entrance? . . . for I am the Lord your God, and I change not.” <span
id="fr_1457"></span>[1458](#fn_1457)   From these words it more
evidently appears that some shall in the last judgment suffer some kind
of purgatorial punishments; for what else can be understood by the word,
“Who shall abide the day of His entrance, or who shall be able to look
<span id="page_446">p. 446</span> <span id="iv.XX.25-Page_446"></span>
upon Him? for He enters as a moulder’s fire, and as the herb of
fullers:  and He shall sit fusing and purifying as if over gold and
silver:  and He shall purify the sons of Levi, and pour them out like
gold and silver?”  Similarly Isaiah says, “The Lord shall wash the
filthiness of the sons and daughters of Zion, and shall cleanse away the
blood from their midst, by the spirit of judgment and by the spirit of
burning.” <span id="fr_1458"></span>[1459](#fn_1458)   Unless perhaps we
should say that they are cleansed from filthiness and in a manner
clarified, when the wicked are separated from them by penal judgment, so
that the elimination and damnation of the one party is the purgation of
the others, because they shall henceforth live free from the
contamination of such men.  But when he says, “And he shall purify the
sons of Levi, and pour them out like gold and silver, and they shall
offer to the Lord sacrifices in righteousness; and the sacrifices of
Judah and Jerusalem shall be pleasing to the Lord,” he declares that
those who shall be purified shall then please the Lord with sacrifices
of righteousness, and consequently they themselves shall be purified
from their own unrighteousness which made them displeasing to God.  Now
they themselves, when they have been purified, shall be sacrifices of
complete and perfect righteousness; for what more acceptable offering
can such persons make to God than themselves?  But this question of
purgatorial punishments we must defer to another time, to give it a more
adequate treatment.  By the sons of Levi and Judah and Jerusalem we
ought to understand the Church herself, gathered not from the Hebrews
only, but from other nations as well; nor such a Church as she now is,
when “if we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth
is not in us,” <span id="fr_1459"></span>[1460](#fn_1459) but as she
shall then be, purged by the last judgment as a threshing-floor by a
winnowing wind, and those of her members who need it being cleansed by
fire, so that there remains absolutely not one who offers sacrifice for
his sins.  For all who make such offerings are assuredly in their sins,
for the remission of which they make offerings, that having made to God
an acceptable offering, they may then be absolved.
