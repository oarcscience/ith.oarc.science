id="iv.XVI.31-p1.1"></span>Chapter 31.—Of Isaac, Who Was Born According
to the Promise, Whose Name Was Given on Account of the Laughter of Both
Parents.</span>

<span id="iv.XVI.31-p2"></span>After these things a son was born to
Abraham, according to God’s promise, of Sarah, and was called Isaac,
which means *laughter*.  For his father had laughed when he was promised
to him, in wondering delight, and his mother, when he was again promised
by those three men, had laughed, doubting for joy; yet she was blamed by
the angel because that laughter, although it was for joy, yet was not
full of faith.  Afterwards she was confirmed in faith by the same
angel.  From this, then, the boy got his name.  For when Isaac was born
and called by that name, Sarah showed that her laughter was not that of
scornful reproach, but that of joyful praise; for she said, “God hath
made me to laugh, so that every one who hears will laugh with <span

me.” <span id="fr_937"></span>[938](#fn_937.md)   Then in a little while
the bond maid was cast out of the house with her son; and, according to
the apostle, these two women signify the old and new covenants,—Sarah
representing that of the Jerusalem which is above, that is, the city of
God. <span id="fr_938"></span>[939](#fn_938.md)
