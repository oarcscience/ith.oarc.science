id="iv.XXI.2-p1.1"></span>Chapter 2.—Whether It is Possible for Bodies
to Last for Ever in Burning Fire.</span>

<span id="iv.XXI.2-p2"></span>What, then, can I adduce to convince those
who refuse to believe that human bodies, animated and living, can not
only survive death, but also last in the torments of everlasting fires? 
They will not allow us to refer this simply to the power of the
Almighty, but demand that we persuade them by some example.  If, then,
we reply to them, that there are animals which certainly are
corruptible, because they are mortal, and which yet live in the midst of
flames; and likewise, that in springs of water so hot that no one can
put his hand in it with impunity a species of worm is found, which not
only lives there, but cannot live elsewhere; they either refuse to
believe these facts unless we can show them, or, if we are in
circumstances to prove them by ocular demonstration or by adequate
testimony, they contend, with the same scepticism, that these facts are
not examples of what we seek to prove, inasmuch as these animals do not
live for ever, and besides, they live in that <span id="page_453">p.

pain, the element of fire being congenial to their nature, and causing
it to thrive and not to suffer,—just as if it were not more incredible
that it should thrive than that it should suffer in such circumstances. 
It is strange that anything should suffer in fire and yet live, but
stranger that it should live in fire and not suffer.  If, then, the
latter be believed, why not also the former?
