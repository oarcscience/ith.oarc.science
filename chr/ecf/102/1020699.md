id="v.iv.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 3.—Some Things are for Use, Some for
Enjoyment.</span>

<span id="v.iv.iii-p2"></span>3.  There are some things, then, which are
to be enjoyed, others which are to be used, others still which enjoy and
use.  Those things which are objects of enjoyment make us happy.  Those
things which are objects of use assist, and (so to speak) support us in
our efforts after happiness, so that we can attain the things that make
us happy and rest in them.  We ourselves, again, who enjoy and use these
things, being placed among both kinds of objects, if we set ourselves to
enjoy those which we ought to use, are hindered in our course, and
sometimes even led away from it; so that, getting entangled in the love
of lower gratifications, we lag behind in, or even altogether turn back
from, the pursuit of the real and proper objects of enjoyment.
