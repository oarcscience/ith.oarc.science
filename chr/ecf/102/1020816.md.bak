<span id="v.vi.xxxvi-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="v.vi.xxxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 36.—The Sixth Rule of
Tichonius.</span>

<span id="v.vi.xxxvi-p2"></span>52.  The sixth rule Tichonius calls the
*recapitulation*, which, with sufficient watchfulness, is discovered in
difficult parts of Scripture.  For certain occurrences are so related,
that the narrative appears to be following the order of time, or the
continuity of events, when it really goes back without mentioning it to
previous occurrences, which had been passed over in their proper place. 
And we make mistakes if we do not understand this, from applying the
rule here spoken of.  For example, in the book of Genesis we read, “And
the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there He put the man
whom He had formed.  And out of the ground made the Lord God to grow
every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food.” <span
id="fr_1923"></span>[1924](#fn_1923.md)   Now here it seems to be indicated
that the events last mentioned took place after God had formed man and
put him in the garden; whereas the fact is, that the two events having
been briefly mentioned, viz., that God planted a garden, and there put
the man whom He had formed, the narrative goes back, by way of
recapitulation, to tell what had before been omitted, the way in which
the garden was planted:  that out of the ground God made to grow every
tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food.  Here there
follows, “The tree of life also was in the midst of the garden, and the
tree of knowledge of good and evil.”  Next the river is mentioned which
watered the garden, and which was parted into four heads, the sources of
four streams; and all this has reference to the arrangements of the
garden.  And when this is finished, there is a repetition of the fact
which had been already told, but which in the strict order of events
came after all this:  “And the Lord God took the man, and put him into
the garden of Eden.” <span id="fr_1924"></span>[1925](#fn_1924.md)   For it
was after all these other things were done that man was put in the
garden, as now appears from the order of the narrative itself:  it was
not after man was put there that the other things were done, as the
previous statement might be thought to imply, did we not accurately mark
and understand the recapitulation by which the narrative reverts to what
had previously been passed over.

<span id="v.vi.xxxvi-p5"></span>53.  In the same book, again, when the
generations of the sons of Noah are recounted, it is said:  “These are
the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their
countries, and in their nations.” <span
id="fr_1925"></span>[1926](#fn_1925.md)   And, again, when the sons of Shem
are enumerated:  “These are the sons of Shem, after their families,
after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations.” <span
id="fr_1926"></span>[1927](#fn_1926.md)   And it is added in reference to
them all:  “These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their
generations, in their nations; and by these were the nations divided in
the earth after the flood.  And the whole earth was of one language and
of one speech.” <span id="fr_1927"></span>[1928](#fn_1927.md)   Now the
addition of this sentence, “And the whole earth was of one language and
of one speech,” seems to indicate that at the time when the nations were
scattered over the earth they had all one language in common; but this
is evidently inconsistent with the previous words, “in their families,
after their tongues.”  For each family or nation could not be said to
have its own language if all had one language in common.  And so it is
by way of recapitulation it is added, “And the whole earth was of one
language and of one speech,” the narrative here going back, without
indicating the change, to tell how it was, that from having one language
in common, the nations were divided into a multitude of tongues.  And,
accordingly, we are forthwith told of the building of the tower, and of
this punishment being there laid upon them as the judgment of God upon
their arrogance; and it was after this that they were scattered over the
earth according to their tongues.

<span id="v.vi.xxxvi-p9"></span>54.  This recapitulation is found in a
still more obscure form; as, for example, our Lord says in the gospel: 
“The same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire from heaven, and
destroyed them all.  Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of
man is revealed.  In that day, he which shall be upon the house-top, and
his stuff in the house, let him not come down to take it away; and he
that is in the field, let him likewise not return back.  Remember Lot’s
wife.” <span id="fr_1928"></span>[1929](#fn_1928.md)   Is it when our Lord
shall have been revealed that men are to give heed to these sayings, and
not to look behind them, that is, not to long after the past life which
they have renounced?  Is not the present rather the time to give heed to
them, that when the Lord shall have been revealed every man may receive
his reward according to the things he has given heed to <span
id="page_573">p. 573</span> <span id="v.vi.xxxvi-Page_573"></span> or
despised?  And yet because Scripture says, “In that day,” the time of
the revelation of the Lord will be thought the time for giving heed to
these sayings, unless the reader be watchful and intelligent so as to
understand the recapitulation, in which he will be assisted by that
other passage of Scripture which even in the time of the apostles
proclaimed:  “Little children, it is the last time.” <span
id="fr_1929"></span>[1930](#fn_1929.md)   The very time then when the
gospel is preached, up to the time that the Lord shall be revealed, is
the day in which men ought to give heed to these sayings:  for to the
same day, which shall be brought to a close by a day of judgment,
belongs that very revelation of the Lord here spoken of. <span
