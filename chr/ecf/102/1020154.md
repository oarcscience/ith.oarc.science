<span id="iv.V.13-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.V.13-p1.1"></span>Chapter 13.—Concerning the Love of Praise,
Which, Though It is a Vice, is Reckoned a Virtue, Because by It Greater
Vice is Restrained.</span>

<span id="iv.V.13-p2"></span>Wherefore, when the kingdoms of the East
had been illustrious for a long time, it pleased God that there should
also arise a Western empire, which, though later in time, should be more
illustrious in extent and greatness.  And, in order that it might
overcome the grievous evils which existed among other nations, He
purposely granted it to such men as, for the sake of honor, and praise,
and glory, consulted well for their country, in whose glory they sought
their own, and whose safety they did not hesitate to prefer to their
own, suppressing the desire of wealth and many other vices for this one
vice, namely, the love of praise.  For he has the soundest perception
who recognizes that even the love of praise is a vice; nor has this
escaped the perception of the poet Horace, who says,

<span id="iv.V.13-p3"></span>“You’re bloated by ambition? take advice:

<span id="iv.V.13-p4"></span>Yon book will ease you if you read it
thrice.” <span id="fr_207"></span>[208](#fn_207.md)

<span id="iv.V.13-p6"></span> And the same poet, in a lyric song, hath
thus spoken with the desire of repressing the passion for domination:

<span id="iv.V.13-p7"></span>“Rule an ambitious spirit, and thou hast

<span id="iv.V.13-p8"></span>A wider kingdom than if thou shouldst join

<span id="iv.V.13-p9"></span>To distant Gades Lybia, and thus

<span id="iv.V.13-p10"></span>Shouldst hold in service either
Carthaginian.” <span id="fr_208"></span>[209](#fn_208.md)

<span id="iv.V.13-p12"></span>Nevertheless, they who restrain baser
lusts, not by the power of the Holy Spirit obtained by the faith of
piety, or by the love of intelligible beauty, but by desire of human
praise, or, at all events, restrain them better by the love of such
praise, are not indeed yet holy, but only less base.  Even Tully was not
able to conceal this fact; for, in the same books which he wrote, *De
Republica*, when speaking concerning the education of a chief of the
state, who ought, he says, to be nourished on glory, goes on to say that
their ancestors did many wonderful and illustrious things through desire
of glory.  So far, therefore, from resisting this vice, they even
thought that it ought to be excited and kindled up, supposing that that
would be beneficial to the republic.  But not even in his books on
philosophy does Tully dissimulate this poisonous opinion, for he there
avows it more clearly than day.  For when he is speaking of those
studies which are to be pursued with a view to the true good, and not
with the vainglorious desire of human praise, he introduces the
following universal and general statement:

<span id="iv.V.13-p13"></span>“Honor nourishes the arts, and all are
stimulated to the prosecution of studies by glory; and those pursuits
are always neglected which are generally discredited.” <span
