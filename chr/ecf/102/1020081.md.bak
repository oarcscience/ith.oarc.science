id="iv.III.8-p1.1"></span>Chapter 8.—Whether Rome Ought to Have Been
Entrusted to the Trojan Gods.</span>

<span id="iv.III.8-p2"></span>Where, then, was the wisdom of entrusting
Rome to the Trojan gods, who had demonstrated their weakness in the loss
of Troy?  Will some one say that, when Fimbria stormed Troy, the gods
were already resident in Rome?  How, then, did the image of Minerva
remain standing?  Besides, if they were at Rome when Fimbria destroyed
Troy, perhaps they were at Troy when Rome itself was taken and set on
fire by the Gauls.  But as they are very acute in hearing, and very
swift in their movements, they came quickly at the cackling of the goose
to defend at least the Capitol, though to defend the rest of the city
they were too long in being warned.
