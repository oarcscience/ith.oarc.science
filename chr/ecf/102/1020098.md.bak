<span id="iv.III.25-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.III.25-p1.1"></span>Chapter 25.—Of the Temple of Concord, Which
Was Erected by a Decree of the Senate on the Scene of These Seditions
and Massacres.</span>

<span id="iv.III.25-p2"></span>A pretty decree of the senate it was,
truly, by which the temple of Concord was built on the spot where that
disastrous rising had taken place, and where so many citizens of every
rank had fallen. <span id="fr_155"></span>[156](#fn_155.md)   I suppose it
was that the monument of the Gracchi’s punishment might strike the eye
and affect the memory of the pleaders.  But what was this but to deride
the gods, by building a temple to that goddess who, had she been in the
city, would not have suffered herself to be torn by such dissensions? 
Or was it that Concord was chargeable with that bloodshed because she
had deserted the minds of the citizens, and was therefore incarcerated
in that temple?  For if they had any regard to consistency, why did they
not rather erect on that site a temple of Discord?  Or is there a reason
for Concord being a goddess while Discord is none?  Does the distinction
of Labeo hold here, who would have made the one a good, the other an
evil deity?—a distinction which seems to have been suggested to him by
the mere fact of his observing at Rome a temple to Fever as well as one
to Health.  But, on the same ground, Discord as well as Concord ought to
be deified.  A hazardous venture the Romans made in provoking so wicked
a goddess, and in forgetting that the destruction of Troy had been
occasioned by her taking offence.  For, being indignant that she was not
invited with the other gods \[to the nuptials of Peleus and Thetis\],
she created dissension among the three goddesses by sending in the
golden apple, which occasioned strife in heaven, victory to Venus, the
rape of Helen, and the destruction of Troy.  Wherefore, if she was
perhaps offended that the Romans had not thought her worthy of a temple
among the other gods in their city, and therefore disturbed the state
with such tumults, to how much fiercer passion would she be roused when
she saw the temple of her adversary erected on the scene of that
massacre, or, in other words, on the scene of her own handiwork! <span
id="page_60">p. 60</span> <span id="iv.III.25-Page_60"></span> Those
wise and learned men are enraged at our laughing at these follies; and
yet, being worshippers of good and bad divinities alike, they cannot
escape this dilemma about Concord and Discord:  either they have
neglected the worship of these goddesses, and preferred Fever and War,
to whom there are shrines erected of great antiquity, or they have
worshipped them, and after all Concord has abandoned them, and Discord
has tempestuously hurled them into civil wars.

person wrote the line, “*Vecordiæ opus ædem facit Concordiæ.*”—The work
of discord makes the temple of Concord.
