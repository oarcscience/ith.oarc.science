<span id="iv.XVIII.35-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XVIII.35-p1.1"></span>Chapter 35.—Of the Prophecy of the Three
Prophets, Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi.</span>

<span id="iv.XVIII.35-p2"></span>There remain three minor prophets,
Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi, who prophesied at the close of the
captivity.  Of these Haggai more openly prophesies of Christ and the
Church thus briefly:  “Thus saith the Lord of hosts, Yet one little
while, and I will shake the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and the
dry land; and I will move all nations, and the desired of all nations
shall come.” <span id="fr_1200"></span>[1201](#fn_1200.md)   The
fulfillment of this prophecy is in part already seen, and in part hoped
for in the end.  For He moved the heaven by the testimony of the angels
and the stars, when Christ became incarnate.  He moved the earth by the
great miracle of His birth of the virgin.  He moved the sea and the dry
land, when Christ was <span id="page_381">p. 381</span> <span
id="iv.XVIII.35-Page_381"></span> proclaimed both in the isles and in
the whole world.  So we see all nations moved to the faith; and the
fulfillment of what follows, “And the desired of all nations shall
come,” is looked for at His last coming.  For ere men can desire and and
wait for Him, they must believe and love Him.

<span id="iv.XVIII.35-p4"></span>Zechariah says of Christ and the
Church, “Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Sion; shout joyfully, O daughter
of Jerusalem; behold, thy King shall come unto thee, just and the
Saviour; Himself poor, and mounting an ass, and a colt the foal of an
ass:  and His dominion shall be from sea to sea, and from the river even
to the ends of the earth.” <span id="fr_1201"></span>[1202](#fn_1201.md)  
How this was done, when the Lord Christ on His journey used a beast of
burden of this kind, we read in the Gospel, where, also, as much of this
prophecy is quoted as appears sufficient for the context.  In another
place, speaking in the Spirit of prophecy to Christ Himself of the
remission of sins through His blood, he says, “Thou also, by the blood
of Thy testament, hast sent forth Thy prisoners from the lake wherein is
no water.” <span id="fr_1202"></span>[1203](#fn_1202.md)   Different
opinions may be held, consistently with right belief, as to what he
meant by this lake.  Yet it seems to me that no meaning suits better
than that of the depth of human misery, which is, as it were, dry and
barren, where there are no streams of righteousness, but only the mire
of iniquity.  For it is said of it in the Psalms, “And He led me forth
out of the lake of misery, and from the miry clay.” <span
id="fr_1203"></span>[1204](#fn_1203.md)

<span id="iv.XVIII.35-p8"></span>Malachi, foretelling the Church which
we now behold propagated through Christ, says most openly to the Jews,
in the person of God, “I have no pleasure in you, and I will not accept
a gift at your hand.  For from the rising even to the going down of the
sun, my name is great among the nations; and in every place sacrifice
shall be made, and a pure oblation shall be offered unto my name:  for
my name shall be great among the nations, saith the Lord.” <span
id="fr_1204"></span>[1205](#fn_1204.md)   Since we can already see this
sacrifice offered to God in every place, from the rising of the sun to
his going down, through Christ’s priesthood after the order of
Melchisedec, while the Jews, to whom it was said, “I have no pleasure in
you, neither will I accept a gift at your hand,” cannot deny that their
sacrifice has ceased, why do they still look for another Christ, when
they read this in the prophecy, and see it fulfilled, which could not be
fulfilled except through Him?  And a little after he says of Him, in the
person of God, “My covenant was with Him of life and peace:  and I gave
to Him that He might fear me with fear, and be afraid before my name. 
The law of truth was in His mouth:  directing in peace He hath walked
with me, and hath turned many away from iniquity.  For the Priest’s lips
shall keep knowledge, and they shall seek the law at His mouth:  for He
is the Angel of the Lord Almighty.” <span
id="fr_1205"></span>[1206](#fn_1205.md)   Nor is it to be wondered at that
Christ Jesus is called the Angel of the Almighty God.  For just as He is
called a servant on account of the form of a servant in which He came to
men, so He is called an angel on account of the *evangel* which He
proclaimed to men.  For if we interpret these Greek words, *evangel* is
“good news,” and *angel* is “messenger.”  Again he says of Him, “Behold
I will send mine angel, and He will look out the way before my face: 
and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come into His temple, even
the Angel of the testament, whom ye desire.  Behold, He cometh, saith
the Lord Almighty, and who shall abide the day of His entry, or who
shall stand at His appearing?” <span
id="fr_1206"></span>[1207](#fn_1206.md)   In this place he has foretold
both the first and second advent of Christ:  the first, to wit, of which
he says, “And He shall come suddenly into His temple;” that is, into His
flesh, of which He said in the Gospel, “Destroy this temple, and in
three days I will raise it up again.” <span
id="fr_1207"></span>[1208](#fn_1207.md)   And of the second advent he says,
“Behold, He cometh, saith the Lord Almighty, and who shall abide the day
of His entry, or who shall stand at His appearing?”  But what he says,
“The Lord whom ye seek, and the Angel of the testament whom ye desire,”
just means that even the Jews, according to the Scriptures which they
read, shall seek and desire Christ.  But many of them did not
acknowledge that He whom they sought and desired had come, being blinded
in their hearts, which were preoccupied with their own merits.  Now what
he here calls the testament, either above, where he says, “My testament
had been with Him,” or here, where he has called Him the Angel of the
testament, we ought, beyond a doubt, to take to be the new testament, in
which the things promised are eternal, and not the old, in which they
are only temporal.  Yet many who are weak are troubled when they see the
wicked abound in such temporal things, because they value them greatly,
and serve the true God to be rewarded with them.  On this account, to
distinguish the eternal blessedness of the new testament, which shall be
given only to the good, from the earthly felicity of the old, which for
the most part is given to the bad as well, the same prophet <span
id="page_382">p. 382</span> <span id="iv.XVIII.35-Page_382"></span>
says, “Ye have made your words burdensome to me:  yet ye have said, In
what have we spoken ill of Thee?  Ye have said, Foolish is every one who
serves God; and what profit is it that we have kept His observances, and
that we have walked as suppliants before the face of the Lord Almighty? 
And now we call the aliens blessed; yea, all that do wicked things are
built up again; yea, they are opposed to God and are saved.  They that
feared the Lord uttered these reproaches every one to his neighbor:  and
the Lord hearkened and heard; and He wrote a book of remembrance before
Him, for them that fear the Lord and that revere His name.” <span
id="fr_1208"></span>[1209](#fn_1208.md)   By that book is meant the New
Testament.  Finally, let us hear what follows:  “And they shall be an
acquisition for me, saith the Lord Almighty, in the day which I make;
and I will choose them as a man chooseth his son that serveth him.  And
ye shall return, and shall discern between the just and the unjust, and
between him that serveth God and him that serveth Him not.  For, behold,
the day cometh burning as an oven, and it shall burn them up; and all
the aliens and all that do wickedly shall be stubble:  and the day that
shall come will set them on fire, saith the Lord Almighty, and shall
leave neither root nor branch.  And unto you that fear my name shall the
Sun of Righteousness arise, and health shall be in His wings; and ye
shall go forth, and exult as calves let loose from bonds.  And ye shall
tread down the wicked, and they shall be ashes under your feet, in the
day in which I shall do \[this\], saith the Lord Almighty.” <span
id="fr_1209"></span>[1210](#fn_1209.md)   This day is the day of judgment,
of which, if God will, we shall speak more fully in its own place.
