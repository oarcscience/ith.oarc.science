<span id="iv.V.16-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.V.16-p1.1"></span>Chapter 16.—Concerning the Reward of the Holy
Citizens of the Celestial City, to Whom the Example of the Virtues of
the Romans are Useful.</span>

<span id="iv.V.16-p2"></span>But the reward of the saints is far
different, who even here endured reproaches for that <span
id="page_98">p. 98</span> <span id="iv.V.16-Page_98"></span> city of God
which is hateful to the lovers of this world.  That city is eternal. 
There none are born, for none die.  There is true and full felicity,—not
a goddess, but a gift of God.  Thence we receive the pledge of faith
whilst on our pilgrimage we sigh for its beauty.  There rises not the
sun on the good and the evil, but the Sun of Righteousness protects the
good alone.  There no great industry shall be expended to enrich the
public treasury by suffering privations at home, for there is the common
treasury of truth.  And, therefore, it was not only for the sake of
recompensing the citizens of Rome that her empire and glory had been so
signally extended, but also that the citizens of that eternal city,
during their pilgrimage here, might diligently and soberly contemplate
these examples, and see what a love they owe to the supernal country on
account of life eternal, if the terrestrial country was so much beloved
by its citizens on account of human glory.
