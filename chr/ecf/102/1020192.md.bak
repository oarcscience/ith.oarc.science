<span id="iv.VII.9-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.VII.9-p1.1"></span>Chapter 9.—Concerning the Power of Jupiter,
and a Comparison of Jupiter with Janus.</span>

<span id="iv.VII.9-p2"></span>But they also show whom they would have
Jove (who is also called Jupiter) understood to be.  He is the god, say
they, who has the power of the causes by which anything comes to be in
the world.  And how great a thing this is, that most noble verse of
Virgil testifies:

<span id="iv.VII.9-p3"></span>“Happy is he who has learned the causes of
things.” <span id="fr_267"></span>[268](#fn_267.md)

<span id="iv.VII.9-p5"></span>But why is Janus preferred to him?  Let
that <span id="page_128">p. 128</span> <span
id="iv.VII.9-Page_128"></span> most acute and most learned man answer us
this question.  “Because,” says he, “Janus has dominion over first
things, Jupiter over highest <span id="fr_268"></span>[269](#fn_268.md)
things.  Therefore Jupiter is deservedly held to be the king of all
things; for highest things are better than first things:  for although
first things precede in time, highest things excel by dignity.”

<span id="iv.VII.9-p7"></span>Now this would have been rightly said had
the first parts of things which are done been distinguished from the
highest parts; as, for instance, it is the beginning of a thing done to
set out, the highest part to arrive.  The commencing to learn is the
first part of a thing begun, the acquirement of knowledge is the highest
part.  And so of all things:  the beginnings are first, the ends
highest.  This matter, however, has been already discussed in connection
with Janus and Terminus.  But the causes which are attributed to Jupiter
are things effecting, not things effected; and it is impossible for them
to be prevented in time by things which are made or done, or by the
beginnings of such things; for the thing which makes is always prior to
the thing which is made.  Therefore, though the beginnings of things
which are made or done pertain to Janus, they are nevertheless not prior
to the efficient causes which they attribute to Jupiter.  For as nothing
takes place without being preceded by an efficient cause, so without an
efficient cause nothing begins to take place.  Verily, if the people
call this god Jupiter, in whose power are all the causes of all natures
which have been made, and of all natural things, and worship him with
such insults and infamous criminations, they are guilty of more shocking
sacrilege than if they should totally deny the existence of any god.  It
would therefore be better for them to call some other god by the name of
Jupiter—some one worthy of base and criminal honors; substituting
instead of Jupiter some vain fiction (as Saturn is said to have had a
stone given to him to devour instead of his son,) which they might make
the subject of their blasphemies, rather than speak of *that* god as
both thundering and committing adultery,—ruling the whole world, and
laying himself out for the commission of so many licentious acts,—having
in his power nature and the highest causes of all natural things, but
not having his own causes good.

<span id="iv.VII.9-p8"></span>Next, I ask what place they find any
longer for this Jupiter among the gods, if Janus is the world; for Varro
defined the true gods to be the soul of the world, and the parts of it. 
And therefore whatever falls not within this definition, is certainly
not a true god, according to them.  Will they then say that Jupiter is
the soul of the world, and Janus the body —that is, this visible world? 
If they say this, it will not be possible for them to affirm that Janus
is a god.  For even, according to them, the body of the world is not a
god, but the soul of the world and its parts.  Wherefore Varro, seeing
this, says that he thinks God is the soul of the world, and that this
world itself is God; but that as a wise man though he consists of soul
and body, is nevertheless called wise from the soul, so the world is
called God from the soul, though it consists of soul and body. 
Therefore the body of the world alone is not God, but either the soul of
it alone, or the soul and the body together, yet so as that it is God
not by virtue of the body, but by virtue of the soul.  If, therefore,
Janus is the world, and Janus is a god, will they say, in order that
Jupiter may be a god, that he is some part of Janus?  For they are wont
rather to attribute universal existence to Jupiter; whence the saying,
“All things are full of Jupiter.” <span
id="fr_269"></span>[270](#fn_269.md)   Therefore they must think Jupiter
also, in order that he may be a god, and especially king of the gods, to
be the world, that he may rule over the other gods—according to them,
his parts.  To this effect, also, the same Varro expounds certain verses
of Valerius Soranus <span id="fr_270"></span>[271](#fn_270.md) in that book
which he wrote apart from the others concerning the worship of the gods.
These are the verses:

<span id="iv.VII.9-p11"></span>“Almighty Jove, progenitor of kings, and
things, and gods,

<span id="iv.VII.9-p12"></span>And eke the mother of the gods, god one
and all.”

<span id="iv.VII.9-p13"></span>But in the same book he expounds these
verses by saying that as the male emits seed, and the female receives
it, so Jupiter, whom they believed to be the world, both emits all seeds
from himself and receives them into himself.  For which reason, he says,
Soranus wrote, “Jove, progenitor and mother;” and with no less reason
said that one and all were the same.  For the world is one, and in that
one are all things.
