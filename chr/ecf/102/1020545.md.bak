<span id="iv.XVIII.27-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XVIII.27-p1.1"></span>Chapter 27.—Of the Times of the Prophets
Whose Oracles are Contained in Books and Who Sang Many Things About the
Call of the Gentiles at the Time When the Roman Kingdom Began and the
Assyrian Came to an End.</span>

<span id="iv.XVIII.27-p2"></span>In order that we may be able to
consider these times, let us go back a little to earlier times.  At the
beginning of the book of the prophet Hosea, who is placed first of
twelve, it is written, “The word of the Lord which came to Hosea in the
days of Uzziah, Jothan, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.” <span
id="fr_1147"></span>[1148](#fn_1147.md)   Amos also writes that he
prophesied in the days of Uzziah, and adds the name of Jeroboam king of
Israel, who lived at the same time. <span
id="fr_1148"></span>[1149](#fn_1148.md)   Isaiah the son of Amos—either the
above-named prophet, or, as is rather affirmed, another who was not a
prophet, but was called by the same name—also puts at the head of his
book these four kings named by Hosea, saying by way of preface that he
prophesied in their days. <span id="fr_1149"></span>[1150](#fn_1149.md)  
Micah also names the same times as those of his prophecy, after the days
of Uzziah; <span id="fr_1150"></span>[1151](#fn_1150.md) for he names the
same three kings as Hosea named,—Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah.  We find
from their own writings that these men prophesied contemporaneously.  To
these are added Jonah in the reign of Uzziah, and Joel in that of
Jotham, who succeeded Uzziah.  But we can find the date of these two
prophets in the chronicles, <span id="fr_1151"></span>[1152](#fn_1151.md)
not in their own writings, for they say nothing about it themselves. 
Now these days extend from Procas king of the Latins, or his predecessor
Aventinus, down to Romulus king of the Romans, or even to the beginning
of the reign of his successor Numa Pompilius.  Hezekiah king of Judah
certainly reigned till then.  So that thus these fountains of prophecy,
as I may call them, burst forth at once during those times when the
Assyrian kingdom failed and the Roman began; so that, just as in the
first period of the Assyrian kingdom Abraham arose, to whom the most
distinct promises were made that all nations should be blessed in his
seed, so at the beginning of the western Babylon, in the time of whose
government Christ was to come in whom these promises were to be
fulfilled, the oracles of the prophets were given not only in spoken but
in written words, for a testimony that so great a thing should come to
pass.  For although the people of Israel hardly ever lacked prophets
from the time when they began to have kings, these were only for their
own use, not for that of the nations.  But when the more manifestly
prophetic Scripture began to be formed, which was to benefit the nations
too, it was fitting that it should begin when this city was founded
which was to rule the nations.
