<span id="v.iv.xxxiv-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="v.iv.xxxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 34.—Christ the First Way to
God.</span>

<span id="v.iv.xxxiv-p2"></span>38.  And mark that even when He who is
Himself the Truth and the Word, by whom all things were made, had been
made flesh that He might dwell among us, the apostle yet says:  “Yea,
though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we
Him no more.” <span id="fr_1748"></span>[1749](#fn_1748)   For Christ,
desiring not only to give the possession to those who had completed the
journey, but also to be Himself the way to those who were just setting
out, determined to take a fleshly body.  Whence also that expression,
“The Lord created <span id="fr_1749"></span>[1750](#fn_1749) me in the
beginning of His way,” <span id="fr_1750"></span>[1751](#fn_1750) that
is, that those who wished to come might begin their journey in Him.  The
apostle, therefore, although still on the way, and following after God
who called him to the reward of His heavenly calling, yet forgetting
those things which were behind, and pressing on towards those things
which were before, <span id="fr_1751"></span>[1752](#fn_1751) had
already passed over the beginning of the way, and had now no further
need of it; yet by this way all must commence their journey who desire
to attain to the truth, and to rest in eternal life.  For He says:  “I
am the way, and the truth, and the life;” <span
id="fr_1752"></span>[1753](#fn_1752) that is, by me men come, to me they
come, in me they rest.  For when we come to Him, we come to the Father
also, because through an equal an equal is known; and the Holy Spirit
binds, and as it were seals us, so that we are able to rest permanently
in the supreme and unchangeable Good.  And hence we may learn how
essential it is that nothing should detain us on the way, when not even
our Lord Himself, so far as He has condescended to be our way, is
willing to detain us, but wishes us rather to press on; and, instead of
weakly clinging to temporal things, even though these have been put on
and worn by Him for our salvation, to pass over them quickly, and to
struggle to attain unto Himself, who has freed our nature from the
bondage of temporal things, and has set it down at the right hand of His
Father.
