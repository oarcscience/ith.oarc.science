<span id="iv.XX.17"></span>

<span id="iv.XX.17-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XX.17-p1.1"></span>Chapter 17.—Of the Endless Glory of the
Church.</span>

<span id="iv.XX.17-p2"></span>“And I saw,” he says, “a great city, new
Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride
adorned for her husband.  And I heard a great voice from the throne,
saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell
with them, and they shall be His people, and God Himself shall be with
them.  And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there
shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, but neither shall
there be any more pain:  because the former things have passed away. 
And He that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things
new.” <span id="fr_1390"></span>[1391](#fn_1390.md)   This city is said to
come down out of heaven, because the grace with which God formed it is
of heaven.  Wherefore He says to it by Isaiah, “I am the Lord that
formed thee.” <span id="fr_1391"></span>[1392](#fn_1391.md)   It is indeed
descended from heaven from its commencement, since its citizens during
the course of this world grow by the grace of God, which cometh down
from above through the laver of regeneration in the Holy Ghost sent down
from heaven.  But by God’s final judgment, which shall be administered
by His Son Jesus Christ, there shall by God’s grace be manifested a
glory so pervading and so new, that no vestige of what is old shall
remain; for even our bodies shall pass from their old corruption and
mortality to new incorruption and immortality.  For to refer this
promise to the present time, in which the saints are reigning with their
King a thousand years, seems to me excessively barefaced, when it is
most distinctly said, “God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes;
and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, but there
shall be no more pain.”  And who is so absurd, and blinded by
contentious opinionativeness, as to be audacious enough to affirm that
in the midst of the calamities of this mortal state, God’s people, or
even one single saint, does live, or has ever lived, or shall ever live,
without tears or pain,—the fact being that the holier a man is, and the
fuller of holy desire, so much the more abundant is the tearfulness of
his supplication?  Are not these the utterances of a citizen of the
heavenly Jerusalem:  “My tears have been my meat day and night;” <span
id="fr_1392"></span>[1393](#fn_1392.md) and “Every night shall I make my
bed to swim; with my tears shall I water my couch;” <span
id="fr_1393"></span>[1394](#fn_1393.md) and “My groaning is not hid from
Thee;” <span id="fr_1394"></span>[1395](#fn_1394.md) and “My sorrow was
renewed?” <span id="fr_1395"></span>[1396](#fn_1395.md)   Or are not those
God’s children who groan, being burdened, not that they wish to be
unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality may be swallowed up of
life? <span id="fr_1396"></span>[1397](#fn_1396.md)   Do not they even who
have the first-fruits of the Spirit groan within themselves, waiting for
the adoption, the redemption of their body? <span
id="fr_1397"></span>[1398](#fn_1397.md)   Was not the Apostle Paul himself
a citizen of the heavenly Jerusalem, and was he not so all the more when
he had heaviness and continual sorrow of heart for his Israelitish
brethren? <span id="fr_1398"></span>[1399](#fn_1398.md)   But when shall
there be no more death in that city, except when it shall be said, “O
death, where is thy contention? <span
id="fr_1399"></span>[1400](#fn_1399.md)   O death, where is thy sting?  The
sting of death is sin.” <span id="fr_1400"></span>[1401](#fn_1400.md)  
Obviously there shall be no sin when it can be said, “Where is”—But as
for the present it is not some poor weak citizen of this city, but this
same Apostle John himself who says, “If we say that we have no sin, we
deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.” <span
id="fr_1401"></span>[1402](#fn_1401.md)   No doubt, though this book is
called the Apocalypse, there are in it many obscure passages to exercise
the mind of the reader, and there are few passages so plain as to assist
us in the interpretation of the others, even though we take pains; and
this difficulty is increased by the repetition of the same things, in
forms so different, that the things referred to seem to be different,
although in fact they are only differently stated.  But in the words,
“God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no
more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, but there shall be no more
pain,” there is so manifest a reference to the future world and the
immortality and eternity of the saints,—for only then and only there
shall such a condition be <span id="page_437">p. 437</span> <span
id="iv.XX.17-Page_437"></span> realized,—that if we think this obscure,
we need not expect to find anything plain in any part of Scripture.
