id="v.iv.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 11.—Wisdom Becoming Incarnate, a
Pattern to Us of Purification.</span>

<span id="v.iv.xi-p2"></span>11.  But of this we should have been wholly
incapable, had not Wisdom condescended to adapt Himself to our weakness,
and to show us a pattern of holy life in the form of our own humanity. 
Yet, since we when we come to Him do wisely, He when He came to us was
considered by proud men to have done very foolishly.  And since we when
we come to Him become strong, He when He came to us was looked upon as
weak.  But “the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness
of God is stronger than men.” <span id="fr_1723"></span>[1724](#fn_1723.md)
  And thus, though Wisdom was Himself our home, He made Himself also the
way by which we should reach our home.
