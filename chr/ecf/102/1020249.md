id="iv.IX.2-p1.1"></span>Chapter 2.—Whether Among the Demons, Inferior
to the Gods, There are Any Good Spirits Under Whose Guardianship the
Human Soul Might Reach True Blessedness.</span>

<span id="iv.IX.2-p2"></span>This book, then, ought, according to the
promise made in the end of the preceding one, to contain a discussion,
not of the difference which exists among the gods, who, according to the
Platonists, are all good, nor of the difference between gods and demons,
the former of whom they separate by a wide interval from men, while the
latter are placed intermediately between the gods and men, but of the
difference, since they make one, among the demons themselves.  This we
shall discuss so far as it bears on our theme.  It has been the common
and usual belief that some of the demons are bad, others good; and this
opinon, whether it be that of the Platonists or any <span
id="page_167">p. 167</span> <span id="iv.IX.2-Page_167"></span> other
sect, must by no means be passed over in silence, lest some one suppose
he ought to cultivate the good demons in order that by their mediation
he may be accepted by the gods, all of whom he believes to be good, and
that he may live with them after death; whereas he would thus be
ensnared in the toils of wicked spirits, and would wander far from the
true God, with whom alone, and in whom alone, the human soul, that is to
say, the soul that is rational and intellectual, is blessed.
