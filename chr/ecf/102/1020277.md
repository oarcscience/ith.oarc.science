<span id="iv.X.6"></span>

<span id="iv.X.6-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.X.6-p1.1"></span>Chapter 6.—Of the True and Perfect
Sacrifice.</span>

<span id="iv.X.6-p2"></span>Thus a true sacrifice is every work which is
done that we may be united to God in holy fellowship, and which has a
reference to that supreme good and end in which alone we can be truly
blessed. <span id="fr_389"></span>[390](#fn_389)   And therefore even
the mercy <span id="page_184">p. 184</span> <span
id="iv.X.6-Page_184"></span> we show to men, if it is not shown for
God’s sake, is not a sacrifice.  For, though made or offered by man,
sacrifice is a divine thing, as those who called it *sacrifice* <span
id="fr_390"></span>[391](#fn_390) meant to indicate.  Thus man himself,
consecrated in the name of God, and vowed to God, is a sacrifice in so
far as he dies to the world that he may live to God.  For this is a part
of that mercy which each man shows to himself; as it is written, “Have
mercy on thy soul by pleasing God.” <span
id="fr_391"></span>[392](#fn_391)   Our body, too, as a sacrifice when
we chasten it by temperance, if we do so as we ought, for God’s sake,
that we may not yield our members instruments of unrighteousness unto
sin, but instruments of righteousness unto God. <span
id="fr_392"></span>[393](#fn_392)   Exhorting to this sacrifice, the
apostle says, “I beseech you, therefore, brethren, by the mercy of God,
that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God,
which is your reasonable service.” <span
id="fr_393"></span>[394](#fn_393)   If, then, the body, which, being
inferior, the soul uses as a servant or instrument, is a sacrifice when
it is used rightly, and with reference to God, how much more does the
soul itself become a sacrifice when it offers itself to God, in order
that, being inflamed by the fire of His love, it may receive of His
beauty and become pleasing to Him, losing the shape of earthly desire,
and being remoulded in the image of permanent loveliness?  And this,
indeed, the apostle subjoins, saying, “And be not conformed to this
world; but be ye transformed in the renewing of your mind, that ye may
prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect will of God.” <span
id="fr_394"></span>[395](#fn_394)   Since, therefore, true sacrifices
are works of mercy to ourselves or others, done with a reference to God,
and since works of mercy have no other object than the relief of
distress or the conferring of happiness, and since there is no happiness
apart from that good of which it is said, “It is good for me to be very
near to God,” <span id="fr_395"></span>[396](#fn_395) it follows that
the whole redeemed city, that is to say, the congregation or community
of the saints, is offered to God as our sacrifice through the great High
Priest, who offered Himself to God in His passion for us, that we might
be members of this glorious head, according to the form of a servant. 
For it was this form He offered, in this He was offered, because it is
according to it He is Mediator, in this He is our Priest, in this the
Sacrifice.  Accordingly, when the apostle had exhorted us to present our
bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, our reasonable
service, and not to be conformed to the world, but to be transformed in
the renewing of our mind, that we might prove what is that good, and
acceptable, and perfect will of God, that is to say, the true sacrifice
of ourselves, he says, “For I say, through the grace of God which is
given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself
more highly than he ought to think, but to think soberly, according as
God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith.  For, as we have many
members in one body, and all members have not the same office, so we,
being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of
another, having gifts differing according to the grace that is given to
us.” <span id="fr_396"></span>[397](#fn_396)   This is the sacrifice of
Christians:  we, being many, are one body in Christ.  And this also is
the sacrifice which the Church continually celebrates in the sacrament
of the altar, known to the faithful, in which she teaches that she
herself is offered in the offering she makes to God.
