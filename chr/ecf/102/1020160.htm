<p class="c34"><a name="iv.V.19-p1"></A><span class="c2"><a name="iv.V.19-p1.1"></A>Chapter 19.&#8212;Concerning the Difference Between True Glory and the Desire of Domination.</span></p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="iv.V.19-p2"></A>There is assuredly a difference between the desire of human glory and the desire of domination; for, though he who has an overweening delight in human glory will be also very prone to aspire earnestly after domination, nevertheless they who desire the true glory even of human praise strive not to displease those who judge well of them.&#160; For there are many good moral qualities, of which many are competent judges, although they are not possessed by many; and by those good moral qualities those men press on to glory, honor and domination, of whom Sallust says, &#8220;But they press on by the true way.&#8221;</p>  
<p class="c26"><a name="iv.V.19-p3"></A>But whosoever, without possessing that desire of glory which makes one fear to displease those who judge his conduct, desires domination and power, very often seeks to obtain what he loves by most open crimes.&#160; Therefore he who desires glory presses on to obtain it either by the true way, or certainly by deceit and artifice, wishing to appear good when he is not.&#160; Therefore to him who possesses virtues it is a great virtue to despise glory; for contempt of it is seen by God, but is not manifest to human judgment.&#160; For whatever any one does before the eyes of men in order to show himself to be a despiser of glory, if they suspect that he is doing it in order to get greater praise,&#8212;that is, greater glory,&#8212;he has no means of demonstrating to the perceptions of those who suspect him that the case is really otherwise than they suspect it to be.&#160; But he who despises the judgment of praisers, despises also the rashness of suspectors.&#160; Their salvation, indeed, he does not despise, if he is truly good; for so great is the righteousness of that man who receives his virtues from the Spirit of God, that he loves his very enemies, and so loves them that he desires that his haters and detractors may be turned to righteousness, and become his associates, and that not in an earthly but in a heavenly country.&#160; But with respect to his praisers, though he sets little value on their praise, he does not set little value on their love; neither does he elude their praise, lest he should forfeit their love.&#160; And, therefore, he strives earnestly to have their praises directed to Him from whom every one receives whatever in him is truly praiseworthy.&#160; But he who is a despiser of glory, but is greedy of domination, exceeds the beasts in the vices of cruelty and luxuriousness.&#160; Such, indeed, were certain of the Romans, who, wanting the love of esteem, wanted not the thirst for domination; and that there were many such, history testifies.&#160; But it was Nero C&aelig;sar who was the first to reach the summit, and, as it were, the citadel, of this vice; for so great was his luxuriousness, that one would have thought there was nothing manly to be dreaded in him, and such his cruelty, that, had not the contrary been known, no one would have thought there was anything effeminate in his character.&#160; Nevertheless power and domination are not given even to such men save by the providence of the most high God, when He judges that the state of human affairs is worthy of such lords.&#160; The divine utterance is clear on this matter; for the Wisdom of God thus speaks:&#160; &#8220;By me kings reign, and tyrants possess the land.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_222"></A><A HREF="#fn_222"><FONT SIZE="1">223</FONT></A>
&#160; But, that it may not be thought that by &#8220;tyrants&#8221; is meant, not wicked and impious kings, but brave men, in accordance with the ancient use of the word, as when Virgil says,</p>  
<p class="c27"><a name="iv.V.19-p5"></A>&#8220;For know that treaty may not stand</p>  
<p class="c33"><a name="iv.V.19-p6"></A>Where king greets king and joins not hand,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_223"></A><A HREF="#fn_223"><FONT SIZE="1">224</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p><a name="iv.V.19-p8"></A>in another place it is most unambiguously said of God, that He &#8220;maketh the man who is an hypocrite to reign on account of the perver  <A NAME="page_102"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 102</FONT></A> <a name="iv.V.19-Page_102"></A>  sity of the people.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_224"></A><A HREF="#fn_224"><FONT SIZE="1">225</FONT></A>
&#160; Wherefore, though I have, according to my ability, shown for what reason God, who alone is true and just, helped forward the Romans, who were good according to a certain standard of an earthly state, to the acquirement of the glory of so great an empire, there may be, nevertheless, a more hidden cause, known better to God than to us, depending on the diversity of the merits of the human race.&#160; Among all who are truly pious, it is at all events agreed that no one without true piety,&#8212;that is, true worship of the true God&#8212;can have true virtue; and that it is not true virtue which is the slave of human praise.&#160; Though, nevertheless, they who are not citizens of the eternal city, which is called the city of God in the sacred Scriptures, are more useful to the earthly city when they possess even that virtue than if they had not even that.&#160; But there could be nothing more fortunate for human affairs than that, by the mercy of God, they who are endowed with true piety of life, if they have the skill for ruling people, should also have the power.&#160; But such men, however great virtues they may possess in this life, attribute it solely to the grace of God that He has bestowed it on them&#8212;willing, believing, seeking.&#160; And, at the same time, they understand how far they are short of that perfection of righteousness which exists in the society of those holy angels for which they are striving to fit themselves.&#160; But however much that virtue may be praised and cried up, which without true piety is the slave of human glory, it is not at all to be compared even to the feeble beginnings of the virtue of the saints, whose hope is placed in the grace and mercy of the true God.</p>
