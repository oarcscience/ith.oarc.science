<span id="iv.XVI.2-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XVI.2-p1.1"></span>Chapter 2.—What Was Prophetically Prefigured
in the Sons of Noah.</span>

<span id="iv.XVI.2-p2"></span>The things which then were hidden are now
sufficiently revealed by the actual events which have followed.  For who
can carefully and intelligently consider these things without
recognizing them accomplished in Christ?  Shem, of whom Christ was born
in the flesh, means “named.”  And what is of greater name than Christ,
the fragrance of whose name is now everywhere perceived, so that even
prophecy sings of it beforehand, comparing it in the Song of
Songs, <span id="fr_860"></span>[861](#fn_860.md) to ointment poured
forth?  Is it not also in the houses of Christ, that is, in the
churches, that the “enlargement” of the nations dwells?  For Japheth
means “enlargement.”  And Ham (*i.e*., hot), who was the middle son of
Noah, and, as it were, separated himself from both, and remained between
them, neither belonging to the first-fruits of Israel nor to the
fullness of the Gentiles, what does he signify but the tribe of
heretics, hot with the spirit, not of patience, but of impatience, with
which the breasts of heretics are wont to blaze, and with which they
disturb the peace of the saints?  But even the heretics yield an
advantage to those that make proficiency, according to the apostle’s
saying, <span id="page_310">p. 310</span> <span
id="iv.XVI.2-Page_310"></span> “There must also be heresies, that they
which are approved may be made manifest among you.” <span
id="fr_861"></span>[862](#fn_861.md)   Whence, too, it is elsewhere said,
“The son that receives instruction will be wise, and he uses the foolish
as his servant.” <span id="fr_862"></span>[863](#fn_862.md)   For while the
hot restlessness of heretics stirs questions about many articles of the
catholic faith, the necessity of defending them forces us both to
investigate them more accurately, to understand them more clearly, and
to proclaim them more earnestly; and the question mooted by an adversary
becomes the occasion of instruction.  However, not only those who are
openly separated from the church, but also all who glory in the
Christian name, and at the same time lead abandoned lives, may without
absurdity seem to be figured by Noah’s middle son:  for the passion of
Christ, which was signified by that man’s nakedness, is at once
proclaimed by their profession, and dishonored by their wicked conduct. 
Of such, therefore, it has been said, “By their fruits ye shall know
them.” <span id="fr_863"></span>[864](#fn_863.md)   And therefore was Ham
cursed in his son, he being, as it were, his fruit.  So, too, this son
of his, Canaan, is fitly interpreted “their movement,” which is nothing
else than their work.  But Shem and Japheth, that is to say, the
circumcision and uncircumcision, or, as the apostle otherwise calls
them, the Jews and Greeks, but called and justified, having somehow
discovered the nakedness of their father (which signifies the Saviour’s
passion), took a garment and laid it upon their backs, and entered
backwards and covered their father’s nakedness, without their seeing
what their reverence hid.  For we both honor the passion of Christ as
accomplished for us, and we hate the crime of the Jews who crucified
Him.  The garment signifies the sacrament, their backs the memory of
things past:  for the church celebrates the passion of Christ as already
accomplished, and no longer to be looked forward to, now that Japheth
already dwells in the habitations of Shem, and their wicked brother
between them.

<span id="iv.XVI.2-p7"></span>But the wicked brother is, in the person
of his son (*i.e*., his work), the boy, or slave, of his good brothers,
when good men make a skillful use of bad men, either for the exercise of
their patience or for their advancement in wisdom.  For the apostle
testifies that there are some who preach Christ from no pure motives;
“but,” says he, “whether in pretence or in truth, Christ is preached;
and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.” <span
id="fr_864"></span>[865](#fn_864.md)   For it is Christ Himself who planted
the vine of which the prophet says, “The vine of the Lord of hosts is
the house of Israel;” <span id="fr_865"></span>[866](#fn_865.md) and He
drinks of its wine, whether we thus understand that cup of which He
says, “Can ye drink of the cup that I shall drink of?” <span
id="fr_866"></span>[867](#fn_866.md) and, “Father, if it be possible, let
this cup pass from me,” <span id="fr_867"></span>[868](#fn_867.md) by which
He obviously means His passion.  Or, as wine is the fruit of the vine,
we may prefer to understand that from this vine, that is to say, from
the race of Israel, He has assumed flesh and blood that He might suffer;
“and he was drunken,” that is, He suffered; “and was naked,” that is,
His weakness appeared in His suffering, as the apostle says, “though He
was crucified through weakness.” <span id="fr_868"></span>[869](#fn_868.md)
  Wherefore the same apostle says, “The weakness of God is stronger than
men; and the foolishness of God is wiser than men.” <span
id="fr_869"></span>[870](#fn_869.md)   And when to the expression “he was
naked” Scripture adds “in his house,” it elegantly intimates that Jesus
was to suffer the cross and death at the hands of His own household, His
own kith and kin, the Jews.  This passion of Christ is only externally
and verbally professed by the reprobate, for what they profess, they do
not understand.  But the elect hold in the inner man this so great
mystery, and honor inwardly in the heart this weakness and foolishness
of God.  And of this there is a figure in Ham going out to proclaim his
father’s nakedness; while Shem and Japheth, to cover or honor it, went
in, that is to say, did it inwardly.

<span id="iv.XVI.2-p14"></span>These secrets of divine Scripture we
investigate as well as we can.  All will not accept our interpretation
with equal confidence, but all hold it certain that these things were
neither done nor recorded without some foreshadowing of future events,
and that they are to be referred only to Christ and His church, which is
the city of God, proclaimed from the very beginning of human history by
figures which we now see everywhere accomplished.  From the blessing of
the two sons of Noah, and the cursing of the middle son, down to
Abraham, or for more than a thousand years, there is, as I have said, no
mention of any righteous persons who worshipped God.  I do not therefore
conclude that there were none; but it had been tedious to mention every
one, and would have displayed historical accuracy rather than prophetic
foresight.  The object of the writer of these sacred books, or rather of
the Spirit of God in him, is not only to record the past, but to depict
the future, so far as it regards the city of God; for whatever is said
of those who are not its citizens, is given either for her instruction,
or as a foil to enhance her glory. <span id="page_311">p. 311</span>
<span id="iv.XVI.2-Page_311"></span> Yet we are not to suppose that all
that is recorded has some signification; but those things which have no
signification of their own are interwoven for the sake of the things
which are significant.  It is only the ploughshare that cleaves the
soil; but to effect this, other parts of the plough are requisite.  It
is only the strings in harps and other musical instruments which produce
melodious sounds; but that they may do so, there are other parts of the
instrument which are not indeed struck by those who sing, but are
connected with the strings which are struck, and produce musical notes. 
So in this prophetic history some things are narrated which have no
significance, but are, as it were, the framework to which the
significant things are attached.
