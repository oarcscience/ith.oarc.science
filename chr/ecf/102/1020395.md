<span id="iv.XIV.3-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XIV.3-p1.1"></span>Chapter 3.—That the Sin is Caused Not by the
Flesh, But by the Soul, and that the Corruption Contracted from Sin is
Not Sin But Sin’s Punishment.</span>

<span id="iv.XIV.3-p2"></span>But if any one says that the flesh is the
cause of all vices and ill conduct, inasmuch as the soul lives wickedly
only because it is moved by the flesh, it is certain he has not
carefully considered the whole nature of man.  For “the corruptible
body, indeed, weigheth down the soul.” <span
id="fr_645"></span>[646](#fn_645.md)   Whence, too, the apostle, speaking
of this corruptible body, of which he had shortly before said, “though
our outward man perish,” <span id="fr_646"></span>[647](#fn_646.md) says,
“We know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we
have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the
heavens.  For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon
with our house which is from heaven:  if so be that being clothed we
shall not be found naked.  For we that are in this tabernacle do groan,
being burdened:  not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon,
that mortality might be swallowed up in life.” <span
id="fr_647"></span>[648](#fn_647.md)   We are then burdened with this
corruptible body; but knowing that the cause of this burdensomeness is
not the nature and substance of the body, but its corruption, we do not
desire to be deprived of the body, but to be clothed with its
immortality.  For then, also, there will be a body, but it shall no
longer be a burden, being no longer corruptible.  At present, then, “the
corruptible body presseth down the soul, and the earthly tabernacle
weigheth down the mind that museth upon <span id="page_264">p.
264</span> <span id="iv.XIV.3-Page_264"></span> many things,”
nevertheless they are in error who suppose that all the evils of the
soul proceed from the body.

<span id="iv.XIV.3-p6"></span>Virgil, indeed, seems to express the
sentiments of Plato in the beautiful lines, where he says,—

<span id="iv.XIV.3-p7"></span>“A fiery strength inspires their lives,

<span id="iv.XIV.3-p8"></span>An essence that from heaven derives,

<span id="iv.XIV.3-p9"></span>Though clogged in part by limbs of clay

<span id="iv.XIV.3-p10"></span>And the dull ’vesture of decay;’” <span
id="fr_648"></span>[649](#fn_648.md)

<span id="iv.XIV.3-p12"></span>but though he goes on to mention the four
most common mental emotions,—desire, fear, joy, sorrow,—with the
intention of showing that the body is the origin of all sins and vices,
saying,—

<span id="iv.XIV.3-p13"></span>“Hence wild desires and grovelling fears,

<span id="iv.XIV.3-p14"></span>And human laughter, human tears,

<span id="iv.XIV.3-p15"></span>Immured in dungeon-seeming nights

<span id="iv.XIV.3-p16"></span>They look abroad, yet see no
light,” <span id="fr_649"></span>[650](#fn_649.md)

<span id="iv.XIV.3-p18"></span>yet we believe quite otherwise.  For the
corruption of the body, which weighs down the soul, is not the cause but
the punishment of the first sin; and it was not the corruptible flesh
that made the soul sinful, but the sinful soul that made the flesh
corruptible.  And though from this corruption of the flesh there arise
certain incitements to vice, and indeed vicious desires, yet we must not
attribute to the flesh all the vices of a wicked life, in case we
thereby clear the devil of all these, for he has no flesh.  For though
we cannot call the devil a fornicator or drunkard, or ascribe to him any
sensual indulgence (though he is the secret instigator and prompter of
those who sin in these ways), yet he is exceedingly proud and envious. 
And this viciousness has so possessed him, that on account of it he is
reserved in chains of darkness to everlasting punishment. <span
id="fr_650"></span>[651](#fn_650.md)   Now these vices, which have dominion
over the devil, the apostle attributes to the flesh, which certainly the
devil has not.  For he says “hatred, variance, emulations, strife,
envying” are the works of the flesh; and of all these evils pride is the
origin and head, and it rules in the devil though he has no flesh.  For
who shows more hatred to the saints? who is more at variance with them?
who more envious, bitter, and jealous?  And since he exhibits all these
works, though he has no flesh, how are they works of the flesh, unless
because they are the works of man, who is, as I said, spoken of under
the name of flesh?  For it is not by having flesh, which the devil has
not, but by living according to himself,—that is, according to man,—that
man became like the devil.  For the devil too, wished to live according
to himself when he did not abide in the truth; so that when he lied,
this was not of God, but of himself, who is not only a liar, but the
father of lies, he being the first who lied, and the originator of lying
as of sin.
