id="iv.ii.xxx-p1.1"></span>Chapter 29.—What the Servants of Christ
Should Say in Reply to the Unbelievers Who Cast in Their Teeth that
Christ Did Not Rescue Them from the Fury of Their Enemies.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.xxx-p2"></span>The whole family of God, most high and
most true, has therefore a consolation of its own,—a consolation which
cannot deceive, and which has in it a surer hope than the tottering and
falling affairs of earth can afford.  They will not refuse the
discipline of this temporal life, in which they are schooled for life
eternal; nor will they lament their experience of it, for the good
things of earth they use as pilgrims who are not detained by them, and
its ills either prove or improve them.  As for those who insult over
them in their trials, and when ills befall them say, “Where is thy
God?” <span id="fr_82"></span>[83](#fn_82.md) we may ask them where their
gods are when they suffer the very calamities for the sake of avoiding
which they worship their gods, or maintain they ought to be worshipped;
for the family of Christ is furnished with its reply:  our God is
everywhere present, wholly everywhere; not confined to any place.  He
can be present unperceived, and be absent without moving; when He
exposes us to adversities, it is either to prove our perfections or
correct our imperfections; and in return for our patient endurance of
the sufferings of time, He reserves for us an everlasting reward.  But
who are you, that we should deign to speak with you even about your own
gods, much less about our God, who is “to be feared above all gods?  For
all the gods of the nations are idols; but the Lord made the
heavens.” <span id="fr_83"></span>[84](#fn_83.md)
