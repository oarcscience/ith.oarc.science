<p class="c34"><a name="iv.IV.5-p1"></A><span class="c2"><a name="iv.IV.5-p1.1"></A>Chapter 5.&#8212;Of the Runaway Gladiators Whose Power Became Like that of Royal Dignity.</span></p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="iv.IV.5-p2"></A>I shall not therefore stay to inquire what sort of men Romulus gathered together, seeing he deliberated much about them,&#8212;how, being assumed out of that life they led into the fellowship of his city, they might cease to think of the punishment they deserved, the fear of which had driven them to greater villainies; so that henceforth they might be made more peaceable members of society.&#160; But this I say, that the Roman empire, which by subduing many nations had already grown great and an object of universal dread, was itself greatly alarmed, and only with much difficulty avoided a disastrous overthrow, because a mere handful of gladiators in Campania, escaping from the games, had recruited a great army, appointed three generals, and most widely and cruelly devastated Italy.&#160; Let them say what god aided these men, so that from a small and contemptible band of robbers they attained to a kingdom, feared even by the Romans, who had such great forces and fortresses.&#160; Or will they deny that they were divinely aided because they did not last long?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_164"></A><A HREF="#fn_164"><FONT SIZE="1">165</FONT></A>
&#160; As if, indeed, the life of any man whatever lasted long.&#160; In that case, too, the gods aid no one to reign, since all individuals quickly die; nor is sovereign power to be reckoned a benefit, because in a little time in every man, and thus in all of them one by one, it vanishes like a vapor.&#160; For what does it matter to those who worshipped the gods under Romulus, and are long since dead, that after their death the Roman empire has grown so great, while they plead their causes before the powers beneath?&#160; Whether  <A NAME="page_67"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 67</FONT></A> <a name="iv.IV.5-Page_67"></A>  those causes are good or bad, it matters not to the question before us.&#160; And this is to be understood of all those who carry with them the heavy burden of their actions, having in the few days of their life swiftly and hurriedly passed over the stage of the imperial office, although the office itself has lasted through long spaces of time, being filled by a constant succession of dying men.&#160; If, however, even those benefits which last only for the shortest time are to be ascribed to the aid of the gods, these gladiators were not a little aided, who broke the bonds of their servile condition, fled, escaped, raised a great and most powerful army, obedient to the will and orders of their chiefs and much feared by the Roman majesty, and remaining unsubdued by several Roman generals, seized many places, and, having won very many victories, enjoyed whatever pleasures they wished, and did what their lust suggested, and, until at last they were conquered, which was done with the utmost difficulty, lived sublime and dominant.&#160; But let us come to greater matters.</p>
