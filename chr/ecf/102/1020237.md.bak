<span id="iv.VIII.18-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.VIII.18-p1.1"></span>Chapter 18.—What Kind of Religion that is
Which Teaches that Men Ought to Employ the Advocacy of Demons in Order
to Be Recommended to the Favor of the Good Gods.</span>

<span id="iv.VIII.18-p2"></span>In vain, therefore, have Apuleius, and
they who think with him, conferred on the demons the honor of placing
them in the air, between the ethereal heavens and the earth, that they
may carry to the gods the prayers of men, to men the answers of the
gods:  for Plato held, they say, that no god has intercourse with man. 
They who believe these things have thought it unbecoming that men should
have intercourse with the gods, and the gods with men, but a befitting
thing that the demons should have intercourse with both gods and men,
presenting to the gods the petitions of men, and conveying to men what
the gods have granted; so that a chaste man, and one who is a stranger
to the crimes of the magic arts, must use as patrons, through whom the
gods may be induced to hear him, demons who love these crimes, although
the very fact of his not loving them ought to have recommended him to
them as one who deserved to be listened to with greater readiness and
willingness on their part.  They love the abominations of the stage,
which chastity does not love.  They love, in the sorceries of the
magicians, “*a thousand arts of inflicting harm*,” <span
id="fr_313"></span>[314](#fn_313.md) which innocence does not love.  Yet
both chastity and innocence, if they wish to obtain anything from the
gods, will not be able to do so by their own merits, except their
enemies act as mediators on their behalf.  Apuleius need not attempt to
justify the fictions of the poets, and the mockeries of the stage.  If
human modesty can act so faithlessly towards itself as not only to love
shameful things, but even to think that they are pleasing to the
divinity, we can cite on the other side their own highest authority and
teacher, Plato.
