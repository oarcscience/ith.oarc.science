<span id="iv.XI.19-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XI.19-p1.1"></span>Chapter 19.—What, Seemingly, We are to
Understand by the Words, “God Divided the Light from the
Darkness.”</span>

<span id="iv.XI.19-p2"></span>Accordingly, though the obscurity of the
divine word has certainly this advantage, that it causes many opinions
about the truth to be started and discussed, each reader seeing some
fresh meaning in it, yet, whatever is said to be meant by an obscure
passage should be either confirmed by the testimony of obvious facts, or
should be asserted in other and less ambiguous texts.  This obscurity is
beneficial, whether the sense of the author is at last reached after the
discussion of many other interpretations, or whether, though that sense
remain concealed, other truths are brought out by the discussion of the
obscurity.  To me it does not seem incongruous with the working of God,
if we understand that the angels were created when that first light was
made, and that a separation was made between the holy and the unclean
angels, when, as is said, “God divided the light from the darkness; and
God called the light Day, and the darkness He called Night.”  For He
alone could make this discrimination, who was able also before they
fell, to foreknow that they would fall, and that, being deprived of the
light of truth, they would abide in the darkness of pride.  For, so far
as regards the day and night, with which we are familiar, He commanded
those luminaries of heaven that are obvious to our senses to divide
between the light and the darkness.  “Let there be,” He says, “lights in
the firmament of the heaven, to divide the day from the night;” and
shortly after He says, “And God made two great lights; the greater light
to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night:  the stars
also.  And God set them in the firmament of the heaven, to give light
upon the earth, and to rule over the day and over the night, and to
divide the light from the darkness.” <span

holy company of the angels spiritually radiant with the illumination of
the truth, and that opposing darkness, which is the noisome foulness of
the spiritual condition of those angels who are turned away from the
light of righteousness, only He Himself could divide, from whom their
wickedness (not of nature, but of will), while yet it was future, could
not be hidden or uncertain.
