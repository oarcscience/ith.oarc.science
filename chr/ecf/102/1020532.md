id="iv.XVIII.14-p1.1"></span>Chapter 14.—Of the Theological
Poets.</span>

<span id="iv.XVIII.14-p2"></span>During the same period of time arose
the poets, who were also called *theologues*, because they made hymns
about the gods; yet about such gods as, although great men, were yet but
men, or the elements of this world which the true God made, or creatures
who were ordained as principalities and powers according to the will of
the Creator and their own merit.  And if, among much that was vain and
false, they sang anything of the one true God, yet, by worshipping Him
along with others who are not gods, and showing them the service that is
due to Him alone, they did not serve Him at all rightly; and even such
poets as Orpheus, Musæus, and Linus, were unable to abstain from
dishonoring their gods by fables.  But yet these theologues worshipped
the gods, and were not worshipped as gods, although the city of the
ungodly is wont, I know not how, to set Orpheus over the sacred, or
rather sacrilegious, rites of hell.  The wife of king Athamas, who was
called Ino, and her son Melicertes, perished by throwing themselves into
the sea, and were, according to popular belief, reckoned among the gods,
like other men of the same times, \[among whom were\] Castor and
Pollux.  The Greeks, indeed, called her who was the mother of
Melicertes, Leucothea, the Latins, Matuta; but both thought her a
goddess.
