<span id="iv.XII.15-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XII.15-p1.1"></span>Chapter 15.—Whether We are to Believe that
God, as He Has Always Been Sovereign Lord, Has Always Had Creatures Over
Whom He Exercised His Sovereignty; And in What Sense We Can Say that the
Creature Has Always Been, and Yet Cannot Say It is Co-Eternal.</span>

<span id="iv.XII.15-p2"></span>For my own part, indeed, as I dare not
say that there ever was a time when the Lord God was not Lord, <span
id="fr_547"></span>[548](#fn_547.md) so I ought not to doubt that man had
no existence before time, and was first created in time.  But when I
consider what God could be the Lord of, if there was not always some
creature, I shrink from making any assertion, remembering my own
insignificance, and that it is written, “What man is he that can know
the counsel of God? or who can think what the will of the Lord is?  For
the thoughts of mortal men are timid, and our devices are but
uncertain.  For the corruptible body presseth down the soul, and the
earthly tabernacle weigheth down the mind that museth upon many
things.” <span id="fr_548"></span>[549](#fn_548.md)   Many things certainly
do I muse upon in this earthly tabernacle, because the one thing which
is true among the many, or beyond the many, I cannot find.  If, then,
among these many thoughts, I say that there have always been creatures
for Him to be Lord of, who is always and ever has been Lord, but that
these creatures have not always been the same, but succeeded one another
(for we would not seem to say that any is co-eternal with the Creator,
an assertion condemned equally by faith and sound reason), I must take
care lest I fall into the absurd and ignorant error of maintaining that
by these successions and changes mortal creatures have always existed,
whereas the immortal creatures had not begun to exist until the date of
our own world, when the angels were created; if at least the angels are
intended by that light which was first made, or, rather, by that heaven
of which it is said, “In the beginning God created the heavens and the
earth.” <span id="fr_549"></span>[550](#fn_549.md)   The angels, at least
did not exist before they were created; for if we say that they have
always existed, we shall seem to make them co-eternal with the Creator. 
Again, if I say that the angels were not created in time, but existed
before all times, as those over whom God, who has ever been Sovereign,
exercised His sovereignty, then I shall be asked whether, if they were
created before all time, they, being creatures, could possibly always
exist.  It may perhaps be replied, Why not *always*, since that which is
in all time may very properly be said to be “always?”  Now so true is it
that these angels have existed in all time that even before time was
they were created; if at least time began with the heavens, and the
angels existed before the heavens.  And if time was even before the
heavenly bodies, not indeed marked by hours, days, months, and
years,—for these measures of time’s periods which are commonly and
properly called times, did manifestly begin with the motion of the
heavenly bodies, and so God said, when He appointed them, “Let them be
for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and for years,” <span
id="fr_550"></span>[551](#fn_550.md) —if, I say, time was before these
heavenly bodies by some changing movement, whose parts succeeded one
another and could not exist simultaneously, and if there was some such
movement among the angels which necessitated the existence of time, and
that they from their very creation should be subject to these temporal
changes, then they have <span id="page_236">p. 236</span> <span
id="iv.XII.15-Page_236"></span> existed in all time, for time came into
being along with them.  And who will say that what was in all time, was
not always?

<span id="iv.XII.15-p7"></span>But if I make such a reply, it will be
said to me, How, then, are they not co-eternal with the Creator, if He
and they always have been?  How even can they be said to have been
created, if we are to understand that they have always existed?  What
shall we reply to this?  Shall we say that both statements are true?
that they always have been, since they have been in all time, they being
created along with time, or time along with them, and yet that also they
were created?  For, similarly, we will not deny that time itself was
created, though no one doubts that time has been in all time; for if it
has not been in all time, then there was a time when there was no time. 
But the most foolish person could not make such an assertion.  For we
can reasonably say there was a time when Rome was not; there was a time
when Jerusalem was not; there was a time when Abraham was not; there was
a time when man was not, and so on:  in fine, if the world was not made
at the commencement of time, but after some time had elapsed, we can say
there was a time when the world was not.  But to say there was a time
when time was not, is as absurd as to say there was a man when there was
no man; or, this world was when this world was not.  For if we are not
referring to the same object, the form of expression may be used, as,
there was another man when this man was not.  Thus we can reasonably say
there was another time when this time was not; but not the merest
simpleton could say there was a time when there was no time.  As, then,
we say that time was created, though we also say that it always has
been, since in all time time has been, so it does not follow that if the
angels have always been, they were therefore not created.  For we say
that they have always been, because they have been in all time; and we
say they have been in all time, because time itself could no wise be
without them.  For where there is no creature whose changing movements
admit of succession, there cannot be time at all.  And consequently,
even if they have always existed, they were created; neither, if they
have always existed, are they therefore co-eternal with the Creator. 
For He has always existed in unchangeable eternity; while they were
created, and are said to have been always, because they have been in all
time, time being impossible without the creature.  But time passing away
by its changefulness, cannot be co-eternal with changeless eternity. 
And consequently, though the immortality of the angels does not pass in
time, does not become past as if now it were not, nor has a future as if
it were not yet, still their movements, which are the basis of time, do
pass from future to past; and therefore they cannot be co-eternal with
the Creator, in whose movement we cannot say that there has been that
which now is not, or shall be that which is not yet.  Wherefore, if God
always has been Lord, He has always had creatures under His
dominion,—creatures, however, not begotten of Him, but created by Him
out of nothing; nor co-eternal with Him, for He was before them though
at no time without them, because He preceded them, not by the lapse of
time, but by His abiding eternity.  But if I make this reply to those
who demand how He was always Creator, always Lord, if there were not
always a subject creation; or how this was created, and not rather
co-eternal with its Creator, if it always was, I fear I may be accused
of recklessly affirming what I know not, instead of teaching what I
know.  I return, therefore, to that which our Creator has seen fit that
we should know; and those things which He has allowed the abler men to
know in this life, or has reserved to be known in the next by the
perfected saints, I acknowledge to be beyond my capacity.  But I have
thought it right to discuss these matters without making positive
assertions, that they who read may be warned to abstain from hazardous
questions, and may not deem themselves fit for everything.  Let them
rather endeavor to obey the wholesome injunction of the apostle, when he
says, “For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is
among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think;
but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the
measure of faith.” <span id="fr_551"></span>[552](#fn_551.md)   For if an
infant receive nourishment suited to its strength, it becomes capable,
as it grows, of taking more; but if its strength and capacity be
overtaxed, it dwines away in place of growing.
