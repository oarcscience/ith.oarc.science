<span id="iv.XII.16-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XII.16-p1.1"></span>Chapter 16.—How We are to Understand God’s
Promise of Life Eternal, Which Was Uttered Before the “Eternal
Times.”</span>

<span id="iv.XII.16-p2"></span>I own that I do not know what ages passed
before the human race was created, yet I have no doubt that no created
thing is co-eternal with the Creator.  But even the apostle speaks of
time as eternal, and this with reference, not to the future, but, which
is more surprising, to the past.  For he says, “In hope of eternal life,
which God that cannot lie promised before the eternal times, but hath
<span id="page_237">p. 237</span> <span id="iv.XII.16-Page_237"></span>
in due times manifested His word.” <span
id="fr_552"></span>[553](#fn_552.md)   You see he says that in the past
there have been eternal times, which, however, were not co-eternal with
God.  And since God before these eternal times not only existed, but
also, “promised” life eternal, which He manifested in its own times
(that is to say, in due times), what else is this than His word?  For
this is life eternal.  But then, how did He promise; for the promise was
made to men, and yet they had no existence before eternal times?  Does
this not mean that, in His own eternity, and in His co-eternal word,
that which was to be in its own time was already predestined and fixed?
