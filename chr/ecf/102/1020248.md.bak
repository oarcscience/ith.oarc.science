id="iv.IX.1-p1.1"></span>Chapter 1.—The Point at Which the Discussion
Has Arrived, and What Remains to Be Handled.</span>

<span id="iv.IX.1-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.IX.1-p2.1"></span>Some</span> have advanced the opinion that
there are both good and bad gods; but some, thinking more respectfully
of the gods, have attributed to them so much honor and praise as to
preclude the supposition of any god being wicked.  But those who have
maintained that there are wicked gods as well as good ones have included
the demons under the name “gods,” and sometimes though more rarely, have
called the gods demons; so that they admit that Jupiter, whom they make
the king and head of all the rest, is called a demon by Homer. <span
id="fr_333"></span>[334](#fn_333.md)   Those, on the other hand, who
maintain that the gods are all good, and far more excellent than the men
who are justly called good, are moved by the actions of the demons,
which they can neither deny nor impute to the gods whose goodness they
affirm, to distinguish between gods and demons; so that, whenever they
find anything offensive in the deeds or sentiments by which unseen
spirits manifest their power, they believe this to proceed not from the
gods, but from the demons.  At the same time they believe that, as no
god can hold direct intercourse with men, these demons hold the position
of mediators, ascending with prayers, and returning with gifts.  This is
the opinion of the Platonists, the ablest and most esteemed of their
philosophers, with whom we therefore chose to debate this
question,—whether the worship of a number of gods is of any service
toward obtaining blessedness in the future life.  And this is the reason
why, in the preceding book, we have inquired how the demons, who take
pleasure in such things as good and wise men loathe and execrate, in the
sacrilegious and immoral fictions which the poets have written not of
men, but of the gods themselves, and in the wicked and criminal violence
of magical arts, can be regarded as more nearly related and more
friendly to the gods than men are, and can mediate between good men and
the good gods; and it has been demonstrated that this is absolutely
impossible.
