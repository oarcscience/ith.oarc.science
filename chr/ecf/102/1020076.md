id="iv.III.3-p1.1"></span>Chapter 3.—That the Gods Could Not Be Offended
by the Adultery of Paris, This Crime Being So Common Among
Themselves.</span>

<span id="iv.III.3-p2"></span>There is no ground, then, for representing
the gods (by whom, as they say, that empire stood, though they are
proved to have been conquered by the Greeks) as being enraged at the
Trojan perjury.  Neither, as others again plead in their defence, was it
indignation at the adultery of Paris that caused them to withdraw their
protection from Troy.  For their habit is to be instigators and
instructors in vice, not its avengers.  “The city of Rome,” says
Sallust, “was first built and inhabited, as I have heard, by the
Trojans, who, flying their country, under the conduct of Æneas, wandered
about without making any settlement.” <span
id="fr_125"></span>[126](#fn_125)   If, then, the gods were of opinion
that the adultery of Paris should be punished, it was chiefly the
Romans, or at least the Romans also, who should have suffered; for the
adultery was brought about by Æneas’ mother.  But how could they hate in
Paris a crime which they made no objection to in their own sister Venus,
who (not to mention any other instance) committed adultery with
Anchises, and so became the mother of Æneas?  Is it because in the one
case Menelaus <span id="fr_126"></span>[127](#fn_126) was aggrieved,
while in the other Vulcan <span id="fr_127"></span>[128](#fn_127)
connived at the crime?  For the gods, I fancy, are so little jealous of
their wives, that they make no scruple of sharing them with men.  But
perhaps I may be suspected of turning the myths into ridicule, and not
handling so weighty a subject with sufficient gravity.  Well, then, let
us say that Æneas is not the son of Venus.  I am willing to admit it;
but is Romulus any more the son of Mars?  For why not the one as well as
the other?  Or is it lawful for gods to have intercourse with women,
unlawful for men to have intercourse with goddesses?  A hard, or rather
an incredible condition, that what was allowed to Mars by the law of
Venus, should not be allowed to Venus herself by her own law.  However,
both cases have the authority of Rome; for Cæsar in modern times
believed no less that he was descended from Venus, <span
id="fr_128"></span>[129](#fn_128) than the ancient Romulus believed
himself the son of Mars.

belonged a descent from Venus, through Iulus, son of Eneas.
