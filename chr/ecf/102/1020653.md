id="iv.XXI.20-p1.1"></span>Chapter 20.—Of Those Who Promise This
Indulgence Not to All, But Only to Those Who Have Been Baptized as
Catholics, Though Afterwards They Have Broken Out into Many Crimes and
Heresies.</span>

<span id="iv.XXI.20-p2"></span>There are others still who make this
promise not even to all who have received the sacraments of the baptism
of Christ and of His body, but only to the catholics, however badly they
have lived.  For these have eaten the body of Christ, not only
sacramentally but really, being incorporated in His body, as the apostle
says, “We, being many, are one bread, one body;” <span
id="fr_1533"></span>[1534](#fn_1533.md) so that, though they have
afterwards lapsed into some heresy, or even into heathenism and
idolatry, yet by virtue of this one thing, that they have received the
baptism of Christ, and eaten the body of Christ, in the body of Christ,
that is to say, in the catholic Church, they shall not die eternally,
but at one time or other obtain eternal life; and all that wickedness of
theirs shall not avail to make their punishment <span id="page_468">p.
468</span> <span id="iv.XXI.20-Page_468"></span> eternal, but only
proportionately long and severe.
