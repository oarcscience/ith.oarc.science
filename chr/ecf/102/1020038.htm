<p class="c21"><a name="iv.ii.xxxiii-p2"></A>Know then, ye who are ignorant of this, and ye who feign ignorance be reminded, while you murmur against Him who has freed you from such rulers, that the scenic games, exhibitions of shameless folly and license, were established at Rome, not by men&#146;s vicious cravings, but by the appointment of your gods.&#160; Much more pardonably might you have rendered divine honors to Scipio than to such gods as these.&#160; The gods were not so moral as their pontiff.&#160; But give me now your attention, if your mind, inebriated by its deep potations of error, can take in any sober truth.&#160; The gods enjoined that games be exhibited in their honor to stay a physical pestilence; their pontiff prohibited the theatre from being constructed, to prevent a moral pestilence.&#160; If, then, there remains in you sufficient mental enlightenment to prefer the soul to the body, choose whom you will worship.&#160; Besides, though the pestilence was stayed, this was not because the voluptuous madness of stage-plays had taken possession of a warlike people hitherto accustomed only to the games of the circus; but these astute and wicked spirits, foreseeing that in due course the pestilence would shortly cease, took occasion to infect, not the bodies, but the morals of their worshippers, with a far more serious disease.&#160; And in this pestilence these gods  <A NAME="page_21"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 21</FONT></A> <a name="iv.ii.xxxiii-Page_21"></A>  find great enjoyment, because it benighted the minds of men with so gross a darkness and dishonored them with so foul a deformity, that even quite recently (will posterity be able to credit it?) some of those who fled from the sack of Rome and found refuge in Carthage, were so infected with this disease, that day after day they seemed to contend with one another who should most madly run after the actors in the theatres.</p>
