id="iv.XVI.23-p1.1"></span>Chapter 23.—Of the Word of the Lord to
Abraham, by Which It Was Promised to Him that His Posterity Should Be
Multiplied According to the Multitude of the Stars; On Believing Which
He Was Declared Justified While Yet in Uncircumcision.</span>

<span id="iv.XVI.23-p2"></span>The word of the Lord came to Abraham in a
vision also.  For when God promised him protection and exceeding great
reward, he, being solicitous about posterity, said that a certain
Eliezer of Damascus, born in his house, would be his heir.  Immediately
he was promised an heir, not that house-born servant, but one who was to
come forth of Abraham himself; and again a seed innumerable, not as the
dust of the earth, but as the stars of heaven,—which rather seems to me
a promise of a posterity exalted in celestial felicity.  For, so far as
multitude is concerned, what are the stars of heaven to the dust of the
earth, unless one should say the comparison is like inasmuch as the
stars also cannot be numbered?  For it is not to be believed that all of
them can be seen.  For the more keenly one observes them, the more does
he see.  So that it is to be supposed some remain concealed from the
keenest observers, to say nothing of those stars which are said to rise
and set in another part of the world most remote from us.  Finally, the
authority of this book condemns those like Aratus or Eudoxus, or any
others who boast that they have found out and written down the complete
number of the stars.  Here, indeed, is set down that sentence which the
apostle quotes in order to commend the grace of God, “Abraham believed
God, and it was counted to him for righteousness;” <span
id="fr_908"></span>[909](#fn_908.md) lest the circumcision should glory,
and be unwilling to receive the uncircumcised nations to the faith of
Christ.  For at the time when he believed, and his faith was counted to
him for righteousness, Abraham had not yet been circumcised.
