<p class="c21"><a name="iv.III.23-p2"></A>But let us now mention, as succinctly as possible, those disasters which were still more vexing, because nearer home; I mean those discords which are erroneously called civil, since they destroy civil interests.&#160; The seditions had now become urban wars, in which blood was freely shed, and in which parties raged against one another, not with wrangling and verbal contention, but with physical force and arms.&#160; What a sea of Roman blood was shed, what desolations and devastations were occasioned in Italy by wars social, wars servile, wars civil!&#160; Before the Latins began the social war against Rome, all the animals used in the service of man&#8212;dogs, horses, asses, oxen, and all the rest that are subject to man&#8212;suddenly grew wild, and forgot their domesticated tameness, forsook their stalls and wandered at large, and could not be closely approached either by strangers or their own masters without danger.&#160; If this was a portent, how serious a calamity must have been portended by a plague which, whether portent or no, was in itself a serious calamity!&#160; Had it happened in our day, the heathen would have been more rabid against us than their animals were against them.</p>
