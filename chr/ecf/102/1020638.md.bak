<span id="iv.XXI.5-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XXI.5-p1.1"></span>Chapter 5.—That There are Many Things Which
Reason Cannot Account For, and Which are Nevertheless True.</span>

<span id="iv.XXI.5-p2"></span>Nevertheless, when we declare the miracles
which God has wrought, or will yet work, and which we cannot bring under
the very eyes of men, sceptics keep demanding that we shall explain
these marvels to reason.  And because we cannot do so, inasmuch as they
are above human comprehension, they suppose we are speaking falsely. 
These persons themselves, therefore, ought to account for all these
marvels which we either can or do see.  And if they perceive that this
is impossible for man to do, they should acknowledge that it cannot be
concluded that a thing has not been or shall not be because it cannot be
reconciled to reason, since there are things now in existence of which
the same is true.  I will not, then, detail the multitude of marvels
which are related in books, and which refer not to things that happened
once and passed away, but that are permanent in certain places, where,
if any one has the desire and opportunity, he may ascertain their truth;
but a few only I recount.  The following are some of the marvels men
tell us:—The salt of Agrigentum in Sicily, when thrown into the <span
id="page_456">p. 456</span> <span id="iv.XXI.5-Page_456"></span> fire,
becomes fluid as if it were in water, but in the water it crackles as if
it were in the fire.  The Garamantæ have a fountain so cold by day that
no one can drink it, so hot by night no one can touch it. <span
id="fr_1500"></span>[1501](#fn_1500.md)   In Epirus, too, there is a
fountain which, like all others, quenches lighted torches, but, unlike
all others, lights quenched torches.  There is a stone found in Arcadia,
and called asbestos, because once lit it cannot be put out.  The wood of
a certain kind of Egyptian fig-tree sinks in water, and does not float
like other wood; and, stranger still, when it has been sunk to the
bottom for some time, it rises again to the surface, though nature
requires that when soaked in water it should be heavier than ever.  Then
there are the apples of Sodom which grow indeed to an appearance of
ripeness, but, when you touch them with hand or tooth, the peal cracks,
and they crumble into dust and ashes.  The Persian stone pyrites burns
the hand when it is tightly held in it and so gets its name from fire. 
In Persia too, there is found another stone called selenite, because its
interior brilliancy waxes and wanes with the moon.  Then in Cappadocia
the mares are impregnated by the wind, and their foals live only three
years.  Tilon, an Indian island, has this advantage over all other
lands, that no tree which grows in it ever loses its foliage.

<span id="iv.XXI.5-p9"></span>These and numberless other marvels
recorded in the history, not of past events, but of permanent
localities, I have no time to enlarge upon and diverge from my main
object; but let those sceptics who refuse to credit the divine writings
give me, if they can, a rational account of them.  For their only ground
of unbelief in the Scriptures is, that they contain incredible things,
just such as I have been recounting.  For, say they, reason cannot admit
that flesh burn and remain unconsumed, suffer without dying.  Mighty
reasoners, indeed, who are competent to give the reason of all the
marvels that exist!  Let them then give us the reason of the few things
we have cited, and which, if they did not know they existed, and were
only assured by us they would at some future time occur, they would
believe still less than that which they now refuse to credit on our
word.  For which of them would believe us if, instead of saying that the
living bodies of men hereafter will be such as to endure everlasting
pain and fire without ever dying, we were to say that in the world to
come there will be salt which becomes liquid in fire as if it were in
water, and crackles in water as if it were in fire; or that there will
be a fountain whose water in the chill air of night is so hot that it
cannot be touched, while in the heat of day it is so cold that it cannot
be drunk; or that there will be a stone which by its own heat burns the
hand when tightly held, or a stone which cannot be extinguished if it
has been lit in any part; or any of those wonders I have cited, while
omitting numberless others?  If we were to say that these things would
be found in the world to come, and our sceptics were to reply, “If you
wish us to believe these things, satisfy our reason about each of them,”
we should confess that we could not, because the frail comprehension of
man cannot master these and such-like wonders of God’s working; and that
yet our reason was thoroughly convinced that the Almighty does nothing
without reason, though the frail mind of man cannot explain the reason;
and that while we are in many instances uncertain what He intends, yet
that it is always most certain that nothing which He intends is
impossible to Him; and that when He declares His mind, we believe Him
whom we cannot believe to be either powerless or false.  Nevertheless
these cavillers at faith and exactors of reason, how do they dispose of
those things of which a reason cannot be given, and which yet exist,
though in apparent contrariety to the nature of things?  If we had
announced that these things were to be, these sceptics would have
demanded from us the reason of them, as they do in the case of those
things which we are announcing as destined to be.  And consequently, as
these present marvels are not non-existent, though human reason and
discourse are lost in such works of God, so those things we speak of are
not impossible because inexplicable; for in this particular they are in
the same predicament as the marvels of earth.

<span id="iv.XXI.5-p3"></span> Alluded to by Moore in his *Melodies:*

<span id="iv.XXI.5-p4"></span>          “The fount that played

<span id="iv.XXI.5-p5"></span>In times of old through Ammon’s shade,

<span id="iv.XXI.5-p6"></span>Though icy cold by day it ran,

<span id="iv.XXI.5-p7"></span>Yet still, like souls of mirth, began

<span id="iv.XXI.5-p8"></span>To burn when night was near.”
