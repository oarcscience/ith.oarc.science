id="v.vi.xxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 21.—David Not Lustful, Though He Fell
into Adultery.</span>

<span id="v.vi.xxi-p2"></span>But when King David had suffered this
injury at the hands of his impious and unnatural son, he not only bore
with him in his mad passion, but mourned over him in his death.  He
certainly was not caught in the meshes of carnal jealousy, seeing that
it was not his own injuries but the sins of his son that moved him.  For
it was on this account he had given orders that his son should not be
slain if he were conquered in battle, that he might have a place of
repentance after he was subdued; and when he was baffled in this design,
he mourned over his son’s death, not because of his own loss, but
because he knew to what punishment so impious an adulterer and parricide
had been hurried. <span id="fr_1874"></span>[1875](#fn_1874.md)   For prior
to this, in the case of another son who had been guilty of no crime,
though he was dreadfully afflicted for him while he was sick, yet he
comforted himself after his death. <span
id="fr_1875"></span>[1876](#fn_1875.md)

<span id="v.vi.xxi-p5"></span>31.  And with what moderation and
self-restraint those men used their wives appears chiefly in this, that
when this same king, carried away by the heat of passion and by temporal
prosperity, had taken unlawful possession of one woman, whose husband
also he ordered to be put to death, he was accused of his crime by a
prophet, who, when he had come to show him his sin, set before him the
parable of the poor man who had but one ewe-lamb, and whose neighbor,
though he had many, yet when a guest came to him spared to take of his
own flock, but set his poor neighbor’s one lamb before his guest to
eat.  And David’s anger being kindled against the man, he commanded that
he should be put to death, and the lamb restored fourfold to the poor
man; thus unwittingly condemning the sin he had wittingly
committed. <span id="fr_1876"></span>[1877](#fn_1876.md)   And when he had
been shown this, and God’s punishment had been denounced against him, he
wiped out his sin in deep penitence.  But yet in this parable it was the
adultery only that was indicated by the poor man’s ewe-lamb; about the
killing of the woman’s husband,—that is, about the murder of the poor
man himself who had the one ewe-lamb,—nothing is said in the parable, so
that the sentence of condemnation is pronounced against the adultery
alone.  And hence we may understand with what temperance he possessed a
number of wives when he was forced to punish himself for transgressing
in regard to one woman.  But in his case the immoderate desire did not
take up its abode with him, but was only a passing guest.  On this
account the unlawful appetite is called even by the accusing prophet, a
guest.  For he did not say that he took the poor man’s ewe-lamb to make
a feast for his king, but for his guest.  In the case of his son
Solomon, however, this lust did not come and pass away like a guest, but
reigned as a king.  And about him Scripture is not silent, but accuses
him of being a lover of strange women; for in the beginning of his reign
he was inflamed with a desire for wisdom, but after he had attained it
through spiritual love, he lost it through carnal lust. <span
