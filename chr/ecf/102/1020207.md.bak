<span id="iv.VII.24-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.VII.24-p1.1"></span>Chapter 24.—Concerning the Surnames of Tellus
and Their Significations, Which, Although They Indicate Many Properties,
Ought Not to Have Established the Opinion that There is a Corresponding
Number of Gods.</span>

<span id="iv.VII.24-p2"></span>The one earth, then, on account of this
fourfold virtue, ought to have had four surnames, but not to have been
considered as four gods,—as Jupiter and Juno, though they have so many
surnames, are for all that only single deities,—for by all these
surnames it is signified that a manifold virtue belongs to one god or to
one goddess; but the multitude of surnames does not imply a multitude of
gods.  But as sometimes even the vilest women themselves grow tired of
those crowds which they have sought after under the impulse of wicked
passion, so also the soul, become vile, and prostituted to impure
spirits, sometimes begins to loathe to multiply to itself gods to whom
to surrender itself to be polluted by them, as much as it once delighted
in so doing.  For Varro himself, as if ashamed of that crowd of gods,
would make Tellus to be one goddess.  “They say,” says he, “that whereas
the one great mother has a tympanum, it is signified that she is the orb
of the earth; whereas she has towers on her head, towns are signified;
and whereas seats are fixed round about her, it is signified that whilst
all things move, she moves not.  And their having made the Galli to
serve this goddess, signifies that they who are in need of seed ought to
follow the earth for in it all seeds are found.  By their throwing
themselves down before her, it is taught,” he says, “that they who
cultivate the earth should not sit idle, for there is always something
for them to do.  The sound of the cymbals signifies the noise made by
the throwing of iron utensils, and by men’s hands, and all other noises
connected with agricultural operations; and these cymbals are of brass,
because the ancients used brazen utensils in their agriculture before
iron was discovered.  They place beside the goddess an unbound and tame
lion, to show that there is no kind of land so wild and so excessively
barren as that it would be profitless to attempt to bring it in and
cultivate it.”  Then he adds that, because they gave many names and
surnames to mother Tellus, it came to be thought that these signified
many gods.  “They think,” says he, “that Tellus is Ops, because the
earth is improved by labor; Mother, because it brings forth much; Great,
because it brings forth seed; Proserpine, because fruits creep forth
from it; Vesta, because it is invested with herbs.  And thus,” says he,
“they not at all absurdly identify other goddesses with the earth.”  If,
then, it is one goddess (though, if the truth were consulted, it is not
even that), why do they nevertheless separate it into many?  Let there
be many names of one goddess, and let there not be as many goddesses as
there are names.

<span id="iv.VII.24-p3"></span>But the authority of the erring ancients
weighs heavily on Varro, and compels him, after having expressed this
opinion, to show signs of uneasiness; for he immediately adds, “With
which things the opinion of the ancients, who thought that there were
really many goddesses, does not conflict.”  How does it not conflict,
when it is entirely a different thing to say that one goddess has many
names, and to say that there are many goddesses?  But it is possible, he
says, that the same thing may both be one, and yet have in it a
plurality of things.  I grant that there are many things in one man; are
there therefore in him many men?  In like manner, in one goddess there
are many things; are there therefore also many goddesses?  But let them
divide, unite, multiply, reduplicate, and implicate as they like.

<span id="iv.VII.24-p4"></span>These are the famous mysteries of Tellus
and the Great Mother, all of which are shown to have reference to mortal
seeds and to agriculture.  Do these things, then,—namely, the tympanum,
the towers, the Galli, the tossing to and fro of limbs, the noise of
cymbals, the images of lions,—do these things, having this reference and
this end, promise eternal life?  Do the mutilated Galli, then, serve
this Great Mother in order to signify that they who are in need of seed
should follow the earth, as though it were not rather the case that this
very service caused them to want seed?  For whether do they, by
following this goddess, acquire seed, being in want of it, or, by
following her, lose seed when they have it?  Is this to interpret or to
deprecate?  Nor is it considered to what a degree malign demons have
gained the upper hand, inasmuch as they have been able to exact such
cruel rites without having dared to promise any great things in return
for them.  Had the earth not been a goddess, men would have, by
laboring, laid <span id="page_137">p. 137</span> <span
id="iv.VII.24-Page_137"></span> their hands on *it* in order to obtain
seed through it, and would not have laid violent hands on themselves in
order to lose seed on account of it.  Had it not been a goddess, it
would have become so fertile by the hands of others, that it would not
have compelled a man to be rendered barren by his own hands; nor that in
the festival of Liber an honorable matron put a wreath on the private
parts of a man in the sight of the multitude, where perhaps her husband
was standing by blushing and perspiring, if there is any shame left in
men; and that in the celebration of marriages the newly-married bride
was ordered to sit upon Priapus.  These things are bad enough, but they
are small and contemptible in comparison with that most cruel
abomination, or most abominable cruelty, by which either set is so
deluded that neither perishes of its wound.  There the enchantment of
fields is feared; here the amputation of members is not feared.  There
the modesty of the bride is outraged, but in such a manner as that
neither her fruitfulness nor even her virginity is taken away; here a
man is so mutilated that he is neither changed into a woman nor remains
a man.
