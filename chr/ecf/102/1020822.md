<span id="v.IV_1.4-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="v.IV_1.4-p1.1"></span>Chapter 4.—The Duty of the Christian
Teacher.</span>

<span id="v.IV_1.4-p2"></span>6.  It is the duty, then, of the
interpreter and teacher of Holy Scripture, the defender of the true
faith and the opponent of error, both to teach what is right and to
refute what is wrong, and in the performance of this task to conciliate
the hostile, to rouse the careless, and to tell the ignorant both what
is occurring at present and what is probable in the future.  But once
that his hearers are friendly, attentive, and ready to learn, whether he
has found them so, or has himself made them so, the remaining objects
are to be carried out in whatever way the case requires.  If the hearers
need teaching, the matter treated of must be made fully known by means
of narrative.  On the other hand, to clear up points that are doubtful
requires reasoning and the exhibition of proof.  If, however, the
hearers require to be roused rather than instructed, in order that they
may be diligent to do what they already know, and to bring their
feelings into harmony with the truths they admit, greater vigor of
speech is needed.  Here entreaties and reproaches, exhortations and
upbraidings, and all the other means of rousing the emotions, are
necessary.

<span id="v.IV_1.4-p3"></span>7.  And all the methods I have mentioned
are constantly used by nearly every one in cases where speech is the
agency employed.
