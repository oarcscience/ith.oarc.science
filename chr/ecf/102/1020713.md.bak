that not a way that lies through space, but through a change of
affections, and one which the guilt of our past sins like a hedge of
thorns barred against us, what could He, who was willing to lay Himself

gracious and more merciful, except to forgive us all our sins, and by
being crucified for us to remove the stern decrees that barred the door
against our return?
