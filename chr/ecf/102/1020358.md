<span id="iv.XII.19-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XII.19-p1.1"></span>Chapter 19.—Of Worlds Without End, or Ages of
Ages. <span id="fr_560"></span>[561](#fn_560.md) </span>

<span id="iv.XII.19-p3"></span>I do not presume to determine whether God
does so, and whether these times which are called “ages of ages” are
joined together in a continuous series, and succeed one another with a
regulated diversity, and leave exempt from their vicissitudes only those
who are freed from their misery, and abide without end in a blessed
immortality; or whether these are called “ages of ages,” that we may
understand that the ages remain unchangeable in God’s unwavering wisdom,
and are the efficient causes, as it were, of those ages which are being
spent in time.  Possibly “ages” is used for “age,” so that nothing else
is meant by “ages of ages” than by “age of age,” as nothing else is
meant by “heavens of heavens” than by “heaven of <span id="page_239">p.
239</span> <span id="iv.XII.19-Page_239"></span> heaven.”  For God
called the firmament, above which are the waters, “Heaven,” and yet the
psalm says, “Let the waters that are above the *heavens* praise the name
of the Lord.” <span id="fr_561"></span>[562](#fn_561.md)   Which of these
two meanings we are to attach to “ages of ages,” or whether there is not
some other and better meaning still, is a very profound question; and
the subject we are at present handling presents no obstacle to our
meanwhile deferring the discussion of it, whether we may be able to
determine anything about it, or may only be made more cautious by its
further treatment, so as to be deterred from making any rash
affirmations in a matter of such obscurity.  For at present we are
disputing the opinion that affirms the existence of those periodic
revolutions by which the same things are always recurring at intervals
of time.  Now whichever of these suppositions regarding the “ages of
ages” be the true one, it avails nothing for the substantiating of those
cycles; for whether the ages of ages be not a repetition of the same
world, but different worlds succeeding one another in a regulated
connection, the ransomed souls abiding in well-assured bliss without any
recurrence of misery, or whether the ages of ages be the eternal causes
which rule what shall be and is in time, it equally follows, that those
cycles which bring round the same things have no existence; and nothing
more thoroughly explodes them than the fact of the eternal life of the
saints.
