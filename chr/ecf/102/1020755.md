id="v.v.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 18.—No Help is to Be Despised, Even
Though It Come from a Profane Source.</span>

<span id="v.v.xviii-p2"></span>28.  But whether the fact is as Varro has
related, or is not so, still we ought not to give up music because of
the superstition of the heathen, if we can derive anything from it <span
id="page_545">p. 545</span> <span id="v.v.xviii-Page_545"></span> that
is of use for the understanding of Holy Scripture; nor does it follow
that we must busy ourselves with their theatrical trumpery because we
enter upon an investigation about harps and other instruments, that may
help us to lay hold upon spiritual things.  For we ought not to refuse
to learn letters because they say that Mercury discovered them; nor
because they have dedicated temples to Justice and Virtue, and prefer to
worship in the form of stones things that ought to have their place in
the heart, ought we on that account to forsake justice and virtue.  Nay,
but let every good and true Christian understand that wherever truth may
be found, it belongs to his Master; and while he recognizes and
acknowledges the truth, even in their religious literature, let him
reject the figments of superstition, and let him grieve over and avoid
men who, “when they knew God, glorified him not as God, neither were
thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart
was darkened.  Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, and
changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to
corruptible man, and to birds, and four-footed beasts, and creeping
things.” <span id="fr_1802"></span>[1803](#fn_1802)
