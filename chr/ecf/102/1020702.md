id="v.iv.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 6.—In What Sense God is
Ineffable.</span>

<span id="v.iv.vi-p2"></span>6.  Have I spoken of God, or uttered His
praise, in any worthy way?  Nay, I feel that I have done nothing more
than desire to speak; and if I have said anything, it is not what I
desired to say.  How do I know this, except from the fact that God is
unspeakable?  But what I have said, if it had been unspeakable, could
not have been spoken.  And so God is not even to be called
“unspeakable,” because to say even this is to speak of Him.  Thus there
arises a curious contradiction of words, because if the unspeakable is
what cannot be spoken of, it is not unspeakable if it can be called
unspeakable.  And this opposition of words is rather to be avoided by
silence than to be explained away by speech.  And yet God, although
nothing worthy of His greatness can be said of Him, has condescended to
accept the worship of men’s mouths, and has desired us through the
medium of our own words to rejoice in His praise.  For on this principle
it is that He is called *Deus* (God).  For the sound of those two
syllables in itself conveys no true knowledge of His nature; but yet all
who know the Latin tongue are led, when that sound reaches their ears,
to think of a nature supreme in excellence and eternal in existence.
