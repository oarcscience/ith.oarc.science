<span id="iv.XXI.9-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XXI.9-p1.1"></span>Chapter 9.—Of Hell, and the Nature of Eternal
Punishments.</span>

<span id="iv.XXI.9-p2"></span>So then what God by His prophet has said
of the everlasting punishment of the damned shall come to pass—shall
without fail come to pass,—“their worm shall not die, neither shall
their fire be quenched.” <span id="fr_1504"></span>[1505](#fn_1504.md)   In
order to impress this upon us most forcibly, the Lord Jesus Himself,
when ordering us to cut off <span id="page_461">p. 461</span> <span
id="iv.XXI.9-Page_461"></span> our members, meaning thereby those
persons whom a man loves as the most useful members of his body, says,
“It is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having two hands
to go into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched; where their
worm dieth not, and their fire is not quenched.”  Similarly of the
foot:  “It is better for thee to enter halt into life, than having two
feet to be cast into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched;
where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.”  So, too, of
the eye:  “It is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with
one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire:  where their
worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.” <span
id="fr_1505"></span>[1506](#fn_1505.md)   He did not shrink from using the
same words three times over in one passage.  And who is not terrified by
this repetition, and by the threat of that punishment uttered so
vehemently by the lips of the Lord Himself?

<span id="iv.XXI.9-p5"></span>Now they who would refer both the fire and
the worm to the spirit, and not to the body, affirm that the wicked, who
are separated from the kindgdom of God, shall be burned, as it were, by
the anguish of a spirit repenting too late and fruitlessly; and they
contend that fire is therefore not inappropriately used to express this
burning torment, as when the apostle exclaims “Who is offended, and I
burn not?” <span id="fr_1506"></span>[1507](#fn_1506.md)   The worm, too,
they think, is to be similarly understood.  For it is written they say,
“As the moth consumes the garment, and the worm the wood, so does grief
consume the heart of a man.” <span id="fr_1507"></span>[1508](#fn_1507.md)
  But they who make no doubt that in that future punishment both body
and soul shall suffer, affirm that the body shall be burned with fire,
while the soul shall be, as it were, gnawed by a worm of anguish. 
Though this view is more reasonable,—for it is absurd to suppose that
either body or soul will escape pain in the future punishment,—yet, for
my own part, I find it easier to understand both as referring to the
body than to suppose that neither does; and I think that Scripture is
silent regarding the spiritual pain of the damned, because, though not
expressed, it is necessarily understood that in a body thus tormented
the soul also is tortured with a fruitless repentance.  For we read in
the ancient Scriptures, “The vengeance of the flesh of the ungodly is
fire and worms.” <span id="fr_1508"></span>[1509](#fn_1508.md)   It might
have been more briefly said, “The vengeance of the ungodly.”  Why, then,
was it said, “The flesh of the ungodly,” unless because both the fire
and the worm are to be the punishment of the flesh?  Or if the object of
the writer in saying, “The vengeance of the flesh,” was to indicate that
this shall be the punishment of those who live after the flesh (for this
leads to the second death, as the apostle intimated when he said, “For
if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die” <span
id="fr_1509"></span>[1510](#fn_1509.md) , let each one make his own choice,
either assigning the fire to the body and the worm to the soul,—the one
figuratively, the other really,—or assigning both really to the body. 
For I have already sufficiently made out that animals can live in the
fire, in burning without being consumed, in pain without dying, by a
miracle of the most omnipotent Creator, to whom no one can deny that
this is possible, if he be not ignorant by whom has been made all that
is wonderful in all nature.  For it is God Himself who has wrought all
these miracles, great and small, in this world which I have mentioned,
and incomparably more which I have omitted, and who has enclosed these
marvels in this world, itself the greatest miracle of all.  Let each
man, then, choose which he will, whether he thinks that the worm is real
and pertains to the body, or that spiritual things are meant by bodily
representations, and that it belongs to the soul.  But which of these is
true will be more readily discovered by the facts themselves, when there
shall be in the saints such knowledge as shall not require that their
own experience teach them the nature of these punishments, but as shall,
by its own fullness and perfection, suffice to instruct them in this
matter.  For “now we know in part, until that which is perfect is
come;” <span id="fr_1510"></span>[1511](#fn_1510.md) only, this we believe
about those future bodies, that they shall be such as shall certainly be
pained by the fire.
