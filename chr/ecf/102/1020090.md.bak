<span id="iv.III.17"></span>

<span id="iv.III.17-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.III.17-p1.1"></span>Chapter 17.—Of the Disasters Which Vexed the
Roman Republic After the Inauguration of the Consulship, and of the
Non-Intervention of the Gods of Rome.</span>

<span id="iv.III.17-p2"></span>After this, when their fears were
gradually diminished,—not because the wars ceased, but because they were
not so furious,—that period in which things were “ordered with justice
and moderation” drew to an end, and there followed that state of matters
which Sallust thus briefly sketches:  “Then began the patricians to
oppress the people as slaves, to condemn them to death or scourging, as
the kings had done, to drive them from their holdings, and to tyrannize
over those who had no property to lose.  The people, overwhelmed by
these oppressive measures, and most of all by usury, and obliged to
contribute both money and personal service to the constant wars, at
length took arms and seceded to Mount Aventine and Mount Sacer, and thus
secured for themselves tribunes and protective laws.  But it was only
the second Punic war that put an end on both sides to discord and
strife.” <span id="fr_150"></span>[151](#fn_150.md)   But why should I
spend time in writing such things, or make others spend it in reading
them?  Let the terse summary of Sallust suffice to intimate the misery
of the republic through all that long period till the second Punic
war,—how it was distracted from without by unceasing wars, and torn with
civil broils and dissensions.  So that those victories they boast were
not the substantial joys of the happy, but the empty comforts of
wretched men, and seductive incitements to turbulent men to concoct
disasters upon disasters.  And let not the good and prudent Romans be
angry at our saying this; and indeed we need neither deprecate nor
denounce their anger, for we know they will harbor none.  For we speak
no more severely than their own authors, and much less elaborately and
strikingly; yet they diligently read these authors, and compel their
children to learn them.  But they who are angry, what would they do to
me were I to say what Sallust says?  “Frequent mobs, seditions, and at
last civil wars, became common, while a few leading men on whom the
masses were dependent, affected supreme power under the seemly pretence
of seeking the good of senate and people; citizens were judged good or
bad without reference to their loyalty to the republic (for all were
equally corrupt); but the wealthy and dangerously powerful were esteemed
good citizens, because they maintained the existing state of things.” 
Now, if those historians judged that an honorable freedom of speech
required that they should not be silent regarding the blemishes of their
own state, which they have in many places loudly applauded in their
ignorance of that other and true city in which citizenship is an
everlasting dignity; what does it become us to do, whose liberty ought
to be so much greater, as our hope in God is better and more assured,
when they impute to our Christ the calamities of this age, in order that
men of the less instructed and weaker sort may be alienated from that
city in which alone eternal and blessed life can be enjoyed?  Nor do we
utter against their gods anything more horrible than their own authors
do, whom they read and circulate. For, indeed, all that we have said we
have derived from them, and there is much more to say of a worse kind
which we are unable to say.

<span id="iv.III.17-p4"></span>Where, then, were those gods who are
supposed to be justly worshipped for the slender and delusive prosperity
of this world, when the Romans, who were seduced to their service by
lying wiles, were harassed by such calamities?  Where were they when
Valerius the consul was killed while defending the Capitol, that had
been fired by exiles and slaves?  He was himself better able to defend
the temple of Jupiter, than that crowd <span id="page_54">p. 54</span>
<span id="iv.III.17-Page_54"></span> of divinities with their most high
and mighty king, whose temple he came to the rescue of were able to
defend him.  Where were they when the city, worn out with unceasing
seditions, was waiting in some kind of calm for the return of the
ambassadors who had been sent to Athens to borrow laws, and was
desolated by dreadful famine and pestilence?  Where were they when the
people, again distressed with famine, created for the first time a
prefect of the market; and when Spurius Melius, who, as the famine
increased, distributed corn to the famishing masses, was accused of
aspiring to royalty, and at the instance of this same prefect, and on
the authority of the superannuated dictator L. Quintius, was put to
death by Quintus Servilius, master of the horse,—an event which
occasioned a serious and dangerous riot?  Where were they when that very
severe pestilence visited Rome, on account of which the people, after
long and wearisome and useless supplications of the helpless gods,
conceived the idea of celebrating Lectisternia, which had never been
done before; that is to say, they set couches in honor of the gods,
which accounts for the name of this sacred rite, or rather
sacrilege? <span id="fr_151"></span>[152](#fn_151.md)   Where were they
when, during ten successive years of reverses, the Roman army suffered
frequent and great losses among the Veians and would have been destroyed
but for the succor of Furius Camillus, who was afterwards banished by an
ungrateful country?  Where were they when the Gauls took sacked, burned,
and desolated Rome?  Where were they when that memorable pestilence
wrought such destruction, in which Furius Camillus too perished, who
first defended the ungrateful republic from the Veians, and afterwards
saved it from the Gauls?  Nay, during this plague, they introduced a new
pestilence of scenic entertainments, which spread its more fatal
contagion, not to the bodies, but the morals of the Romans?  Where were
they when another frightful pestilence visited the city—I mean the
poisonings imputed to an incredible number of noble Roman matrons, whose
characters were infected with a disease more fatal than any plague?  Or
when both consuls at the head of the army were beset by the Samnites in
the Caudine Forks, and forced to strike a shameful treaty, 600 Roman
knights being kept as hostages; while the troops, having laid down their
arms, and being stripped of everything, were made to pass under the yoke
with one garment each?  Or when, in the midst of a serious pestilence,
lightning struck the Roman camp and killed many?  Or when Rome was
driven, by the violence of another intolerable plague, to send to
Epidaurus for Æsculapius as a god of medicine; since the frequent
adulteries of Jupiter in his youth had not perhaps left this king of all
who so long reigned in the Capitol, any leisure for the study of
medicine?  Or when, at one time, the Lucanians, Brutians, Samnites,
Tuscans, and Senonian Gauls conspired against Rome, and first slew her
ambassadors, then overthrew an army under the prætor, putting to the
sword 13,000 men, besides the commander and seven tribunes?  Or when the
people, after the serious and long-continued disturbances at Rome, at
last plundered the city and withdrew to Janiculus; a danger so grave,
that *Hortensius* was created dictator,—an office which they had
recourse to only in extreme emergencies; and he, having brought back the
people, died while yet he retained his office,—an event without
precedent in the case of any dictator, and which was a shame to those
gods who had now Æsculapius among them?

<span id="iv.III.17-p6"></span>At that time, indeed, so many wars were
everywhere engaged in, that through scarcity of soldiers they enrolled
for military service the *proletarii*, who received this name, because,
being too poor to equip for military service, they had leisure to beget
offspring. <span id="fr_152"></span>[153](#fn_152.md)   Pyrrhus, king of
Greece, and at that time of widespread renown, was invited by the
Tarentines to enlist himself against Rome.  It was to him that Apollo,
when consulted regarding the issue of his enterprise, uttered with some
pleasantry so ambiguous an oracle, that whichever alternative happened,
the god himself should be counted divine.  For he so worded the
oracle <span id="fr_153"></span>[154](#fn_153.md) that whether Pyrrhus was
conquered by the Romans, or the Romans by Pyrrhus, the soothsaying god
would securely await the issue.  And then what frightful massacres of
both armies ensued!  Yet Pyrrhus remained conqueror, and would have been
able now to proclaim Apollo a true diviner, as he understood the oracle,
had not the Romans been the conquerors in the next engagement.  And
while such disastrous wars were being waged, a terrible disease broke
out among the women.  For the pregnant women died before delivery.  And
Æsculapius, I fancy, excused himself in this matter on the ground that
he professed to be arch-physician, not midwife.  Cattle, too, similarly
perished; so that it was believed that the whole race of animals was
destined <span id="page_55">p. 55</span> <span
id="iv.III.17-Page_55"></span> to become extinct.  Then what shall I say
of that memorable winter in which the weather was so incredibly severe,
that in the Forum frightfully deep snow lay for forty days together, and
the Tiber was frozen?  Had such things happened in our time, what
accusations we should have heard from our enemies!  And that other great
pestilence, which raged so long and carried off so many; what shall I
say of it?  Spite of all the drugs of Æsculapius, it only grew worse in
its second year, till at last recourse was had to the Sibylline books,—a
kind of oracle which, as Cicero says in his *De Divinatione*, owes
significance to its interpreters, who make doubtful conjectures as they
can or as they wish.  In this instance, the cause of the plague was said
to be that so many temples had been used as private residences.  And
thus Æsculapius for the present escaped the charge of either ignominious
negligence or want of skill.  But why were so many allowed to occupy
sacred tenements without interference, unless because supplication had
long been addressed in vain to such a crowd of gods, and so by degrees
the sacred places were deserted of worshippers, and being thus vacant,
could without offence be put at least to some human uses?  And the
temples, which were at that time laboriously recognized and restored
that the plague might be stayed, fell afterwards into disuse, and were
again devoted to the same human uses.  Had they not thus lapsed into
obscurity, it could not have been pointed to as proof of Varro’s great
erudition, that in his work on sacred places he cites so many that were
unknown.  Meanwhile, the restoration of the temples procured no cure of
the plague, but only a fine excuse for the gods.
