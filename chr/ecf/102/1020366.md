<span id="iv.XII.27-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XII.27-p1.1"></span>Chapter 27.—That the Whole Plenitude of the
Human Race Was Embraced in the First Man, and that God There Saw the
Portion of It Which Was to Be Honored and Rewarded, and that Which Was
to Be Condemned and Punished.</span>

<span id="iv.XII.27-p2"></span>With good cause, therefore, does the true
religion recognize and proclaim that the same God who created the
universal cosmos, created also all the animals, souls as well as
bodies.  Among the terrestrial animals man was made by Him in His own
image, and, for the reason I have given, was made one individual, though
he was not left solitary.  For there is nothing so social by nature, so
unsocial by its corruption, as this race.  And human nature has nothing
more appropriate, either for the prevention of discord, or for the <span

healing of it, where it exists, than the remembrance of that first
parent of us all, whom God was pleased to create alone, that all men
might be derived from one, and that they might thus be admonished to
preserve unity among their whole multitude.  But from the fact that the
woman was made for him from his side, it was plainly meant that we
should learn how dear the bond between man and wife should be.  These
works of God do certainly seem extraordinary, because they are the first
works.  They who do not believe them, ought not to believe any
prodigies; for these would not be called prodigies did they not happen
out of the ordinary course of nature.  But, is it possible that anything
should happen in vain, however hidden be its cause, in so grand a
government of divine providence?  One of the sacred Psalmists says,
“Come, behold the works of the Lord, what prodigies He hath wrought in
the earth.” <span id="fr_575"></span>[576](#fn_575)   Why God made woman
out of man’s side, and what this first prodigy prefigured, I shall, with
God’s help, tell in another place.  But at present, since this book must
be concluded, let us merely say that in this first man, who was created
in the beginning, there was laid the foundation, not indeed evidently,
but in God’s foreknowledge, of these two cities or societies, so far as
regards the human race.  For from that man all men were to be
derived—some of them to be associated with the good angels in their
reward, others with the wicked in punishment; all being ordered by the
secret yet just judgment of God.  For since it is written, “All the
paths of the Lord are mercy and truth,” <span
id="fr_576"></span>[577](#fn_576) neither can His grace be unjust, nor
His justice cruel.
