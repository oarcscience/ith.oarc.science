id="v.v.xlii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 42.—Sacred Scripture Compared with
Profane Authors.</span>

<span id="v.v.xlii-p2"></span>63.  But just as poor as the store of gold
and silver and garments which the people of Israel brought with them out
of Egypt was in comparison with the riches which they afterwards
attained at Jerusalem, and which reached their height in the reign of
King Solomon, so poor is all the useful knowledge which is gathered from
the books of the heathen when compared with the knowledge of Holy
Scripture.  For whatever man may have learnt from other sources, if it
is hurtful, it is there condemned; if it is useful, it is therein
contained.  And while every man may find there all that he has learnt of
useful elsewhere, he will find there in much greater abundance things
that are to be found nowhere else, but can be learnt only in the
wonderful sublimity and wonderful simplicity of the Scriptures.

<span id="v.v.xlii-p3"></span>When, then, the reader is possessed of the
instruction here pointed out, so that unknown signs have ceased to be a
hindrance to him; when he is meek and lowly of heart, subject to the
easy yoke of Christ, and loaded with His light burden, rooted and
grounded and built up in faith, so that knowledge cannot puff him up,
let him then approach the consideration and discussion of ambiguous
signs in Scripture.  And about these I shall now, in a third book,
endeavor to say what the Lord shall be pleased to vouchsafe.
