<span id="iv.XVIII.31-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XVIII.31-p1.1"></span>Chapter 31.—Of the Predictions Concerning
the Salvation of the World in Christ, in Obadiah, Nahum, and
Habakkuk.</span>

<span id="iv.XVIII.31-p2"></span>The date of three of the minor
prophets, Obadiah, Nahum, and Habakkuk, is neither mentioned by
themselves nor given in the chronicles of Eusebius and Jerome.  For
although they put Obadiah with Micah, yet when Micah prophesied does not
appear from that part of their writings in which the dates are noted. 
And this, I think, has happened through their error in negligently
copying the works of others.  But we could not find the two others now
mentioned in the copies of the chronicles which we have; yet because
they are contained in the canon, we ought not to pass them by.

<span id="iv.XVIII.31-p3"></span>Obadiah, so far as his writings are
concerned, the briefest of all the prophets, speaks against Idumea, that
is, the nation of Esau, that reprobate elder of the twin sons of Isaac
and grandsons of Abraham.  Now if, by that form of speech in which a
part is put for the whole, we take Idumea as put for the nations, we may
understand of Christ what he says among other things, “But upon Mount
Sion shall be safety, and there shall be a Holy One.” <span
id="fr_1167"></span>[1168](#fn_1167)   And a little after, at the end of
the same prophecy, he says, “And those who are saved again shall come up
out of Mount Sion, that they may defend Mount Esau, and it shall be a
kingdom to the Lord.” <span id="fr_1168"></span>[1169](#fn_1168)   It is
quite evident this was fulfilled when those saved again out of Mount
Sion—that is, the believers in Christ from Judea, of whom the apostles
are chiefly to be acknowledged—went up to defend Mount Esau.  How could
they defend it except by making safe, through the preaching of the
gospel, those who believed that they might be “delivered from the power
of darkness and translated into the kingdom of God?” <span
id="fr_1169"></span>[1170](#fn_1169)   This he expressed as an
inference, adding, “And it shall be to the Lord a kingdom.”  For Mount
Sion signifies Judea, where it is predicted there shall be safety, and a
Holy One, that is, Christ Jesus.  But Mount Esau is Idumea, which
signifies the Church of the Gentiles, which, as I have expounded, those
saved again out of Sion have defended that it should be a kingdom to the
Lord.  This was obscure before it took place; but what believer does not
find it out now that it is done?

<span id="iv.XVIII.31-p7"></span>As for the prophet Nahum, through him
God says, “I will exterminate the graven and the molten things:  I will
make thy burial.  For lo, the feet of Him that bringeth good tidings and
announceth peace are swift upon the mountains!  O Judah, celebrate thy
festival days, and perform thy vows; for now they shall not go on any
more so as to become antiquated.  It is completed, it is consumed, it is
taken away.  He ascendeth who breathes in thy face, delivering thee out
of tribulation.” <span id="fr_1170"></span>[1171](#fn_1170)   Let him
that remembers the gospel call to mind who hath ascended from hell and
breathed the Holy Spirit in the face of Judah, that is, of the Jewish
disciples; for they belong to the New Testament, whose festival days are
so spiritually renewed that they cannot become antiquated.  Moreover, we
already see the graven and molten things, that is, the idols of the
false gods, exterminated through the gospel, and given up to oblivion as
of the grave, and we know that this prophecy is fulfilled in this very
thing.

<span id="iv.XVIII.31-p9"></span>Of what else than the advent of Christ,
who was to come, is Habakkuk understood to say, “And the Lord answered
me, and said, Write the vision openly on a tablet of boxwood, that he
that readeth these things may understand.  For the vision is yet for a
time appointed, and it will arise in the end, and will not become void: 
if it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, and will not be
delayed?” <span id="fr_1171"></span>[1172](#fn_1171)
