<span id="iv.III.1-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.III.1-p1.1"></span>Chapter 1.—Of the Ills Which Alone the Wicked
Fear, and Which the World Continually Suffered, Even When the Gods Were
Worshipped.</span>

<span id="iv.III.1-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.III.1-p2.1"></span>Of</span> moral and spiritual evils, which are
above all others to be deprecated, I think enough has already been said
to show that the false gods took no steps to prevent the people who
worshipped them from being overwhelmed by such calamities, but rather
aggravated the ruin.  I see I must now speak of those evils which alone
are dreaded by the heathen—famine, pestilence, war, pillage, captivity,
massacre, and the like calamities, already enumerated in the first
book.  For evil men account those things alone evil which do not make
men evil; neither do they blush to praise good things, and yet to remain
evil among the good things they praise.  It grieves them more to own a
bad house than a bad life, as if it were man’s greatest good to have
everything good but himself.  But not even such evils as were alone
dreaded by the heathen were warded off by their gods, even when they
were most unrestrictedly worshipped.  For in various times and places
before the advent of our Redeemer, the human race was crushed with
numberless and sometimes incredible calamities; and at that time what
gods but those did the world worship, if you except the one nation of
the Hebrews, and, beyond them, such individuals as the most secret and
most just judgment of God counted worthy of divine grace? <span
id="fr_119"></span>[120](#fn_119.md)   But that I may not be prolix, I will
be silent regarding the heavy calamities that have been suffered by any
other nations, and will speak only of what happened to Rome and the
Roman empire, by which I mean Rome properly so called, and those lands
which already, before the coming of Christ, had by alliance or conquest
become, as it were, members of the body of the state.
