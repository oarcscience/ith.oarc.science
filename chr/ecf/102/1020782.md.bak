<span id="v.vi.ii-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="v.vi.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 2.—Rule for Removing Ambiguity by
Attending to Punctuation.</span>

<span id="v.vi.ii-p2"></span>2.  But when proper words make Scripture
ambiguous, we must see in the first place that there is nothing wrong in
our punctuation or pronunciation.  Accordingly, if, when attention is
given to the passage, it shall appear to <span id="page_557">p.
557</span> <span id="v.vi.ii-Page_557"></span> be uncertain in what way
it ought to be punctuated or pronounced, let the reader consult the rule
of faith which he has gathered from the plainer passages of Scripture,
and from the authority of the Church, and of which I treated at
sufficient length when I was speaking in the first book about things. 
But if both readings, or all of them (if there are more than two), give
a meaning in harmony with the faith, it remains to consult the context,
both what goes before and what comes after, to see which interpretation,
out of many that offer themselves, it pronounces for and permits to be
dovetailed into itself.

<span id="v.vi.ii-p3"></span>3.  Now look at some examples.  The
heretical pointing, <span id="fr_1833"></span>[1834](#fn_1833.md) “*In
principio erat verbum, et verbum erat apud Deum, et Deus erat*,” <span
id="fr_1834"></span>[1835](#fn_1834.md) so as to make the next sentence
run, “*Verbum hoc erat in principio apud Deum*,” <span
id="fr_1835"></span>[1836](#fn_1835.md) arises out of unwillingness to
confess that the Word was God.  But this must be rejected by the rule of
faith, which, in reference to the equality of the Trinity, directs us to
say:  “*et Deus erat verbum*;” <span
id="fr_1836"></span>[1837](#fn_1836.md) and then to add:  “*hoc erat in
principio apud Deum*.” <span id="fr_1837"></span>[1838](#fn_1837.md)

<span id="v.vi.ii-p9"></span>4.  But the following ambiguity of
punctuation does not go against the faith in either way you take it, and
therefore must be decided from the context.  It is where the apostle
says:  “What I shall choose I wot not:  for I am in a strait betwixt
two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ, which is far
better:  nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for
you.” <span id="fr_1838"></span>[1839](#fn_1838.md)   Now it is uncertain
whether we should read, “*ex duobus concupiscentiam habens*” \[having a
desire for two things\], or “*compellor autem ex duobus*” \[I am in a
strait betwixt two\]; and so to add:  “*concupiscentiam habens dissolvi,
et esse cum Christo*” \[having a desire to depart, and to be with
Christ\].  But since there follows “*multo enim magis optimum*” \[for it
is far better\], it is evident that he says he has a desire for that
which is better; so that, while he is in a strait betwixt two, yet he
has a desire for one and sees a necessity for the other; a desire, viz.,
to be with Christ, and a necessity to remain in the flesh.  Now this
ambiguity is resolved by one word that follows, which is translated
*enim* \[for\]; and the translators who have omitted this particle have
preferred the interpretation which makes the apostle seem not only in a
strait betwixt two, but also to have a desire for two. <span
id="fr_1839"></span>[1840](#fn_1839.md)   We must therefore punctuate the
sentence thus:  “*et quid eligam ignoro:  compellor autem ex duobus*”
\[what I shall choose I wot not:  for I am in a strait betwixt two\];
and after this point follows:  “*concupiscentiam habens dissolvi, et
esse cum Christo*” \[having a desire to depart, and to be with
Christ\].  And, as if he were asked why he has a desire for this in
preference to the other, he adds:  “*multo enim magis optimum*” \[for it
is far better\].  Why, then, is he in a strait betwixt the two?  Because
there is a need for his remaining, which he adds in these terms: 
“*manere in carne necessarium propter vos*” \[nevertheless to abide in
the flesh is more needful for you\].

<span id="v.vi.ii-p12"></span>5.  Where, however, the ambiguity cannot
be cleared up, either by the rule of faith or by the context, there is
nothing to hinder us to point the sentence according to any method we
choose of those that suggest themselves.  As is the case in that passage
to the Corinthians:  “Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved,
let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit,
perfecting holiness in the fear of God.  Receive us; we have wronged no
man.” <span id="fr_1840"></span>[1841](#fn_1840.md)   It is doubtful
whether we should read, “*mundemus nos ab omni coinquinatione carnis et
spiritus*” \[let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh
and spirit\], in accordance with the passage, “that she may be holy both
in body and in spirit,” <span id="fr_1841"></span>[1842](#fn_1841.md) or,
“*mundemus nos ab omni coinquinatione carnis*” \[let us cleanse
ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh\], so as to make the next
sentence, “*et spiritus perficientes sanctificationem in timore Dei
capite nos*” \[and perfecting holiness of spirit in the fear of God,
receive us\].  Such ambiguities of punctuation, therefore, are left to
the reader’s discretion.
