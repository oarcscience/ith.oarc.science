<span id="iv.II_1.4-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.II_1.4-p1.1"></span>Chapter 4.—That the Worshippers of the Gods
Never Received from Them Any Healthy Moral Precepts, and that in
Celebrating Their Worship All Sorts of Impurities Were Practiced.</span>

<span id="iv.II_1.4-p2"></span>First of all, we would ask why their gods
took no steps to improve the morals of their worshippers.  That the true
God should neglect those who did not seek His help, that was but
justice; but why did those gods, from whose worship ungrateful men are
now complaining that they are prohibited, issue no laws which might have
guided their devotees to a virtuous life?  Surely it was but just, that
such care as men showed to the worship <span id="page_25">p. 25</span>
<span id="iv.II_1.4-Page_25"></span> of the gods, the gods on their part
should have to the conduct of men.  But, it is replied, it is by his own
will a man goes astray.  Who denies it?  But none the less was it
incumbent on these gods, who were men’s guardians, to publish in plain
terms the laws of a good life, and not to conceal them from their
worshippers.  It was their part to send prophets to reach and convict
such as broke these laws, and publicly to proclaim the punishments which
await evil-doers, and the rewards which may be looked for by those that
do well.  Did ever the walls of any of their temples echo to any such
warning voice?  I myself, when I was a young man, used sometimes to go
to the sacrilegious entertainments and spectacles; I saw the priests
raving in religious excitement, and heard the choristers; I took
pleasure in the shameful games which were celebrated in honor of gods
and goddesses, of the virgin Cœlestis, <span
id="fr_89"></span>[90](#fn_89.md) and Berecynthia, <span
id="fr_90"></span>[91](#fn_90.md) the mother of all the gods.  And on the
holy day consecrated to her purification, there were sung before her
couch productions so obscene and filthy for the ear—I do not say of the
mother of the gods, but of the mother of any senator or honest man—nay,
so impure, that not even the mother of the foul-mouthed players
themselves could have formed one of the audience.  For natural reverence
for parents is a bond which the most abandoned cannot ignore.  And,
accordingly, the lewd actions and filthy words with which these players
honored the mother of the gods, in presence of a vast assemblage and
audience of both sexes, they could not for very shame have rehearsed at
home in presence of their own mothers.  And the crowds that were
gathered from all quarters by curiosity, offended modesty must, I should
suppose, have scattered in the confusion of shame.  If these are sacred
rites, what is sacrilege?  If this is purification, what is pollution? 
This festivity was called the Tables, <span
id="fr_91"></span>[92](#fn_91.md) as if a banquet were being given at which
unclean devils might find suitable refreshment.  For it is not difficult
to see what kind of spirits they must be who are delighted with such
obscenities, unless, indeed, a man be blinded by these evil spirits
passing themselves off under the name of gods, and either disbelieves in
their existence, or leads such a life as prompts him rather to
propitiate and fear them than the true God.

<span id="iv.II_1.4-p3"></span> Tertullian (*Apol.* c. 24) mentions
Cœlestis as specially worshipped in Africa.  Augustin mentions her again
in the 26th chapter of this book, and in other parts of his works.

<span id="fn_90"></span>[25:91](1020047.htm#fr_90.md) <span

<span id="iv.II_1.4-p4"></span> Berecynthia is one of the many names of
Rhea or Cybele.  Livy (xxix. 11) relates that the image of Cybele was
brought to Rome the day before the ides of April, which was accordingly
dedicated as her feast-day.  The image, it seems, had to be washed in
the stream Almon, a tributary of the Tiber, before being placed in the
temple of Victory; and each year, as the festival returned, the washing
was repeated with much pomp at the same spot.  Hence Lucan’s line (i.
600), *Et lotam parvo revocant Almone Cybelen,* and the elegant verses
of Ovid. *Fast*. iv. 337 et seq.
