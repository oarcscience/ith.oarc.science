<span id="iv.XIX.27-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XIX.27-p1.1"></span>Chapter 27.—That the Peace of Those Who Serve
God Cannot in This Mortal Life Be Apprehended in Its Perfection.</span>

<span id="iv.XIX.27-p2"></span>But the peace which is peculiar to
ourselves we enjoy now with God by faith, and shall hereafter enjoy
eternally with Him by sight.  But the peace which we enjoy in this life,
whether common to all or peculiar to ourselves, is rather the solace of
our misery than the positive enjoyment of felicity.  Our very
righteousness, too, though true in so far as it has respect to the true
good, is yet in this life of such a kind that it consists rather in the
remission of sins than in the perfecting of virtues.  Witness the prayer
of the whole city of God in its pilgrim state, for it cries to God by
the mouth of all its members, “Forgive us our debts as we forgive our
debtors.” <span id="fr_1305"></span>[1306](#fn_1305)   And this prayer
is efficacious not for those whose faith is “without works and
dead,” <span id="fr_1306"></span>[1307](#fn_1306) but for those whose
faith “worketh by love.” <span id="fr_1307"></span>[1308](#fn_1307)  
For as reason, though subjected to God, is yet “pressed down by the
corruptible body,” <span id="fr_1308"></span>[1309](#fn_1308) so long as
it is in this mortal condition, it has not perfect authority over vice,
and therefore this prayer is needed by the righteous.  For though it
exercises authority, the vices do not submit without a struggle.  For
however well one maintains the conflict, and however thoroughly he has
subdued these enemies, there steals in some evil thing, which, if it
does not find ready expression in act, slips out by the lips, or
insinuates itself into the thought; and therefore his peace is not full
so long as he is at war with his vices.  For it is a doubtful conflict
he wages with those that resist, and his victory over those that are
defeated is not secure, but full of anxiety and effort.  Amidst these
temptations, therefore, of all which it has been summarily said in the
divine oracles, “Is not human life upon earth a temptation?” <span
id="fr_1309"></span>[1310](#fn_1309) who but a proud man can presume
that he so lives that he has no need to say to God, “Forgive us our
debts?”  And such a man is not great, but swollen and puffed up with
vanity, and is justly resisted by Him who abundantly gives grace to the
humble.  Whence it is said, “God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace
to the humble.” <span id="fr_1310"></span>[1311](#fn_1310)   In this,
then, consists the righteousness of a man, that he submit himself to
God, his body to his soul, and his vices, even when they rebel, to his
reason, which either defeats or at least resists them; and also that he
beg from God grace to do his duty, <span
id="fr_1311"></span>[1312](#fn_1311) and the pardon of his sins, and
that he render to God thanks for all the blessings he receives.  But, in
that final peace to which all our righteousness has reference, and for
the sake of which it is maintained, as our nature shall enjoy a sound
immortality and incorruption, and shall have no more vices, and as we
shall experience no resistance either from ourselves or from others, it
will not be necessary that reason should rule vices which no longer
exist, but God shall rule the man, and the soul shall rule the body,
with a sweetness and facility suitable to the felicity of a life which
is done with bondage.  And this condition shall there <span
id="page_420">p. 420</span> <span id="iv.XIX.27-Page_420"></span> be
eternal, and we shall be assured of its eternity; and thus the peace of
this blessedness and the blessedness of this peace shall be the supreme
good.
