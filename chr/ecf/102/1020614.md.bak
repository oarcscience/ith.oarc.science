<span id="iv.XX.12-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XX.12-p1.1"></span>Chapter 12.—Whether the Fire that Came Down
Out of Heaven and Devoured Them Refers to the Last Punishment of the
Wicked.</span>

<span id="iv.XX.12-p2"></span>The words, “And fire came down out of
heaven and devoured them,” are not to be understood of the final
punishment which shall be inflicted when it is said, “Depart from me, ye
cursed, into everlasting fire;” <span
id="fr_1377"></span>[1378](#fn_1377.md) for then they shall be cast into
the fire, not fire come down out of heaven upon them.  In this place
“fire out of heaven” is well understood of the firmness of the saints,
wherewith they refuse to yield obedience to those who rage against
them.  For the firmament is “heaven,” by whose firmness these assailants
shall be pained with blazing zeal, for they shall be impotent to draw
away the saints to the party of Antichrist.  This is the fire which
shall devour them, and this is “from God;” for it <span id="page_433">p.
433</span> <span id="iv.XX.12-Page_433"></span> is by God’s grace the
saints become unconquerable, and so torment their enemies.  For as in a
good sense it is said, “The zeal of Thine house hath consumed me,” <span
id="fr_1378"></span>[1379](#fn_1378.md) so in a bad sense it is said, “Zeal
hath possessed the uninstructed people, and now fire shall consume the
enemies.” <span id="fr_1379"></span>[1380](#fn_1379.md)   “And now,” that
is to say, not the fire of the last judgment.  Or if by this fire coming
down out of heaven and consuming them, John meant that blow wherewith
Christ in His coming is to strike those persecutors of the Church whom
He shall then find alive upon earth, when He shall kill Antichrist with
the breath of His mouth, <span id="fr_1380"></span>[1381](#fn_1380.md) then
even this is not the last judgment of the wicked; but the last judgment
is that which they shall suffer when the bodily resurrection has taken
place.
