id="iv.XIII.22-p1.1"></span>Chapter 22.—That the Bodies of the Saints
Shall After the Resurrection Be Spiritual, and Yet Flesh Shall Not Be
Changed into Spirit.</span>

<span id="iv.XIII.22-p2"></span>The bodies of the righteous, then, such
as they shall be in the resurrection, shall need neither any fruit to
preserve them from dying of disease or the wasting decay of old age, nor
any other physical nourishment to allay the cravings of hunger or of
thirst; for they shall be invested with so sure and every way inviolable
an immortality, that they shall not eat save when they choose, nor be
under the necessity of eating, while they enjoy the power <span
id="page_257">p. 257</span> <span id="iv.XIII.22-Page_257"></span> of
doing so.  For so also was it with the angels who presented themselves
to the eye and touch of men, not because they could do no otherwise, but
because they were able and desirous to suit themselves to men by a kind
of manhood ministry.  For neither are we to suppose, when men receive
them as guests, that the angels eat only in appearance, though to any
who did not know them to be angels they might seem to eat from the same
necessity as ourselves.  So these words spoken in the Book of Tobit,
“You saw me eat, but you saw it but in vision;” <span
id="fr_611"></span>[612](#fn_611.md) that is, you thought I took food as
you do for the sake of refreshing my body.  But if in the case of the
angels another opinion seems more capable of defence, certainly our
faith leaves no room to doubt regarding our Lord Himself, that even
after His resurrection, and when now in spiritual but yet real flesh, He
ate and drank with His disciples; for not the power, but the need, of
eating and drinking is taken from these bodies.  And so they will be
spiritual, not because they shall cease to be bodies, but because they
shall subsist by the quickening spirit.
