id="v.v.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter 10.—Unknown or Ambiguous Signs Prevent
Scripture from Being Understood.</span>

<span id="v.v.x-p2"></span>15.  Now there are two causes which prevent
what is written from being understood:  its being vailed either under
unknown, or under ambiguous signs.  Signs are either proper or
figurative.  They are called proper when they are used to point out the
objects they were designed to point out, as we say *bos* when we mean an
ox, because all men who with us use the Latin tongue call it by this
name.  Signs are figurative when the things themselves which we indicate
by the proper names are used to signify something else, as we say *bos*,
and understand by that syllable the ox, which is ordinarily called by
that name; but then further by that ox understand a preacher of the
gospel, as Scripture signifies, according to the apostle’s explanation,
when it says:  “Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the
corn.” <span id="fr_1772"></span>[1773](#fn_1772)
