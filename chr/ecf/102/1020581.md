<span id="iv.XIX.8-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XIX.8-p1.1"></span>Chapter 8.—That the Friendship of Good Men
Cannot Be Securely Rested In, So Long as the Dangers of This Life Force
Us to Be Anxious.</span>

<span id="iv.XIX.8-p2"></span>In our present wretched condition we
frequently mistake a friend for an enemy, and an enemy for a friend. 
And if we escape this pitiable blindness, is not the unfeigned
confidence and mutual love of true and good friends our one solace in
human society, filled as it is with misunderstandings and calamities? 
And yet the more friends we have, and the more widely they are
scattered, the more numerous are our fears that some portion of the vast
masses of the disasters of life may light upon them.  For we are not
only anxious lest they suffer from famine, war, disease, captivity, or
the inconceivable horrors of slavery, but we are also affected with the
much more painful dread that their friendship may be changed into
perfidy, malice, and injustice.  And when these contingencies actually
occur,—as they do the more frequently the more friends we have, and the
more widely they are scattered,—and when they come to our knowledge, who
but the man who has experienced it can tell with what pangs the heart is
torn?  We would, in fact, prefer to hear that they <span
id="page_406">p. 406</span> <span id="iv.XIX.8-Page_406"></span> were
dead, although we could not without anguish hear of even this.  For if
their life has solaced us with the charms of friendship, can it be that
their death should affect us with no sadness?  He who will have none of
this sadness must, if possible, have no friendly intercourse.  Let him
interdict or extinguish friendly affection; let him burst with ruthless
insensibility the bonds of every human relationship; or let him contrive
so to use them that no sweetness shall distil into his spirit.  But if
this is utterly impossible, how shall we contrive to feel no bitterness
in the death of those whose life has been sweet to us?  Hence arises
that grief which affects the tender heart like a wound or a bruise, and
which is healed by the application of kindly consolation.  For though
the cure is affected all the more easily and rapidly the better
condition the soul is in, we must not on this account suppose that there
is nothing at all to heal.  Although, then, our present life is
afflicted, sometimes in a milder, sometimes in a more painful degree, by
the death of those very dear to us, and especially of useful public men,
yet we would prefer to hear that such men were dead rather than to hear
or perceive that they had fallen from the faith, or from virtue,—in
other words, that they were spiritually dead.  Of this vast material for
misery the earth is full, and therefore it is written, “Is not human
life upon earth a trial?” <span id="fr_1273"></span>[1274](#fn_1273.md)  
And with the same reference the Lord says, “Woe to the world because of
offenses!” <span id="fr_1274"></span>[1275](#fn_1274.md) and again,
“Because iniquity abounded, the love of many shall wax cold.” <span
id="fr_1275"></span>[1276](#fn_1275.md)   And hence we enjoy some
gratification when our good friends die; for though their death leaves
us in sorrow, we have the consolatory assurance that they are beyond the
ills by which in this life even the best of men are broken down or
corrupted, or are in danger of both results.
