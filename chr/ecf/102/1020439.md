<span id="iv.XV.18-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XV.18-p1.1"></span>Chapter 18.—The Significance of Abel, Seth,
and Enos to Christ and His Body the Church.</span>

<span id="iv.XV.18-p2"></span>“And to Seth,” it is said, “there was born
a son, and he called his name Enos:  he hoped to call on the name of the
Lord God.” <span id="fr_823"></span>[824](#fn_823.md)   Here we have a loud
testimony to the truth.  Man, then, the son of the resurrection, lives
in hope:  he lives in hope as long as the city of God, which is begotten
by faith in the resurrection, sojourns in this world.  For in these two
men, Abel, signifying “grief,” and his brother Seth, signifying
“resurrection,” the death of Christ and His life from the dead are
prefigured.  And by faith in these is begotten in this world the city of
God, that is to say, the man who has hoped to call on the name of the
Lord.  “For by hope,” says the apostle, “we are saved:   but hope that
is seen is not hope:  for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for? 
But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for
it.” <span id="fr_824"></span>[825](#fn_824.md)   Who can avoid referring
this to a profound mystery?  For did not Abel hope to call upon the name
of the Lord God when his sacrifice is mentioned in Scripture as having
been accepted by God?  Did not Seth himself hope to call on the name of
the Lord God, of whom it was said, “For God hath appointed me another
seed instead of Abel?”  Why then is this which is found to be common to
all the godly specially attributed to Enos, unless because it was fit
that in him, who is mentioned as the first-born of the father of those
generations which were separated to the better part of the heavenly
city, there should be a type of the man, or society of men, who live not
according to man in contentment with earthly felicity, but according to
God in hope of everlasting felicity?  And it was not said, “He hoped in
the Lord God,” nor “He called on the name of the Lord God,” but “He
hoped to call on the name of the Lord God.”  And what does this “hoped
to call” mean, unless it is a prophecy that a people should arise who,
according to the election of grace, would call on the name of the Lord
God?  It is this which has been said by another prophet, and which the
apostle interprets of the people who belong to the grace of God:  “And
it shall be that whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be
saved.” <span id="fr_825"></span>[826](#fn_825.md)   For these two
expressions, “And he called his name Enos, which means man,” and “He
hoped to call on the name of the Lord God,” are sufficient proof that
man ought not to rest his hopes in himself; as it is elsewhere written,
“Cursed is the man that trusteth in man.” <span
id="fr_826"></span>[827](#fn_826.md)   Consequently no one ought to trust
in himself that he shall become a citizen of that other city which is
not dedicated in the name of Cain’s son in this present time, that is to
say, in the fleeting course of this mortal world, but in the immortality
of perpetual blessedness.
