<span id="iv.XXI.15-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XXI.15-p1.1"></span>Chapter 15.—That Everything Which the Grace
of God Does in the Way of Rescuing Us from the Inveterate Evils in Which
We are Sunk, Pertains to the Future World, in Which All Things are Made
New.</span>

<span id="iv.XXI.15-p2"></span>Nevertheless, in the “heavy yoke that is
laid upon the sons of Adam, from the day that they go out of their
mother’s womb to the day that they return to the mother of all things,”
there is found an admirable though painful monitor teaching us to be
sober-minded, and convincing us that this life has become penal in
consequence of that outrageous wickedness which was perpetrated in
Paradise, and that all to which the New Testament invites belongs to
that future inheritance which awaits us in the world to come, and is
offered for our acceptance, as the earnest that we may, in its own due
time, obtain that of which it is the pledge.  Now, therefore, let us
walk in hope, and let us by the spirit mortify the deeds of the flesh,
and so make progress from day to day.  For “the Lord know <span
id="page_465">p. 465</span> <span id="iv.XXI.15-Page_465"></span> eth
them that are His;” <span id="fr_1523"></span>[1524](#fn_1523) and “as
many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are sons of God,” <span
id="fr_1524"></span>[1525](#fn_1524) but by grace, not by nature.  For
there is but one Son of God by nature, who in His compassion became Son
of man for our sakes, that we, by nature sons of men, might by grace
become through Him sons of God.  For He, abiding unchangeable, took upon
Him our nature, that thereby He might take us to Himself; and, holding
fast His own divinity, He became partaker of our infirmity, that we,
being changed into some better thing, might, by participating in His
righteousness and immortality, lose our own properties of sin and
mortality, and preserve whatever good quality He had implanted in our
nature perfected now by sharing in the goodness of His nature.  For as
by the sin of one man we have fallen into a misery so deplorable, so by
the righteousness of one Man, who also is God, shall we come to a
blessedness inconceivably exalted.  Nor ought any one to trust that he
has passed from the one man to the other until he shall have reached
that place where there is no temptation, and have entered into the peace
which he seeks in the many and various conflicts of this war, in which
“the flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the
flesh.” <span id="fr_1525"></span>[1526](#fn_1525)   Now, such a war as
this would have had no existence if human nature had, in the exercise of
free will, continued steadfast in the uprightness in which it was
created.  But now in its misery it makes war upon itself, because in its
blessedness it would not continue at peace with God; and this, though it
be a miserable calamity, is better than the earlier stages of this life,
which do not recognize that a war is to be maintained.  For better is it
to contend with vices than without conflict to be subdued by them. 
Better, I say, is war with the hope of peace everlasting than captivity
without any thought of deliverance.  We long, indeed, for the cessation
of this war, and, kindled by the flame of divine love, we burn for
entrance on that well-ordered peace in which whatever is inferior is for
ever subordinated to what is above it.  But if (which God forbid) there
had been no hope of so blessed a consummation, we should still have
preferred to endure the hardness of this conflict, rather than, by our
non-resistance, to yield ourselves to the dominion of vice.
