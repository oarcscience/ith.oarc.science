<span id="v.vi.xxxvii-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="v.vi.xxxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 37.—The Seventh Rule of
Tichonius.</span>

<span id="v.vi.xxxvii-p2"></span>55.  The seventh rule of Tichonius and
the last, is about *the devil and his body*.  For he is the head of the
wicked, who are in a sense his body, and destined to go with him into
the punishment of everlasting fire, just as Christ is the head of the
Church, which is His body, destined to be with Him in His eternal
kingdom and glory.  Accordingly, as the first rule, which is called *of
the Lord and His body*, directs us, when Scripture speaks of one and the
same person, to take pains to understand which part of the statement
applies to the head and which to the body; so this last rule shows us
that statements are sometimes made about the devil, whose truth is not
so evident in regard to himself as in regard to his body; and his body
is made up not only of those who are manifestly out of the way, but of
those also who, though they really belong to him, are for a time mixed
up with the Church, until they depart from this life, or until the chaff
is separated from the wheat at the last great winnowing.  For example,
what is said in Isaiah, “How he is fallen from heaven, Lucifer, son of
the morning!” <span id="fr_1931"></span>[1932](#fn_1931.md) and the other
statements of the context which, under the figure of the king of
Babylon, are made about the same person, are of course to be understood
of the devil; and yet the statement which is made in the same place, “He
is ground down on the earth, who sendeth to all nations,” <span
id="fr_1932"></span>[1933](#fn_1932.md) does not altogether fitly apply to
the head himself.  For, although the devil sends his angels to all
nations, yet it is his body, not himself, that is ground down on the
each, except that he himself is in his body, which is beaten small like
the dust which the wind blows from the face of the earth.

<span id="v.vi.xxxvii-p5"></span>56.  Now all these rules, except the
one about the promises and the law, make one meaning to be understood
where another is expressed, which is the peculiarity of figurative
diction; and this kind of diction, it seems to me, is too widely spread
to be comprehended in its full extent by any one.  For, wherever one
thing is said with the intention that another should be understood we
have a figurative expression, even though the name of the trope is not
to be found in the art of rhetoric.  And when an expression of this sort
occurs where it is customary to find it, there is no trouble in
understanding it; when it occurs, however, where it is not customary, it
costs labor to understand it, from some more, from some less, just as
men have got more or less from God of the gifts of intellect, or as they
have access to more or fewer external helps.  And, as in the case of
proper words which I discussed above, and in which things are to be
understood just as they are expressed, so in the case of figurative
words, in which one thing is expressed and another is to be understood,
and which I have just finished speaking of as much as I thought enough,
students of these venerable documents ought to be counselled not only to
make themselves acquainted with the forms of expression ordinarily used
in Scripture, to observe them carefully, and to remember them
accurately, but also, what is especially and before all things
necessary, to pray that they may understand them.  For in these very
books on the study of which they are intent, they read, “The Lord giveth
wisdom:  out of His mouth cometh knowledge and understanding;” <span
id="fr_1933"></span>[1934](#fn_1933.md) and it is from Him they have
received their very desire for knowledge, if it is wedded to piety.  But
about signs, so far as relates to words, I have now said enough.  It
remains to discuss, in the following book, so far as God has given me
light, the means of communicating our thoughts to others.
