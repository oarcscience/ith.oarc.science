<span id="v.IV_1.18"></span>

<span id="v.IV_1.18-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="v.IV_1.18-p1.1"></span>Chapter 18.—The Christian Orator is
Constantly Dealing with Great Matters.</span>

<span id="v.IV_1.18-p2"></span>35.  Now the author I have quoted could
have exemplified these three directions, as laid down by himself, in
regard to legal questions:  he could not, however, have done so in
regard to ecclesiastical questions,—the only ones that an address such
as I wish to give shape to is concerned with.  For of legal questions
those are called small which have reference to pecuniary transactions;
those great where a matter relating to man’s life or liberty comes up. 
Cases, again, which have to do with neither of these, and where the
intention is not to get the hearer to do, or to pronounce judgment upon
anything, but only to give him pleasure, occupy as it were a middle
place between the former two, and are on that account called middling,
or moderate.  For moderate things get their name from *modus* (a
measure); and it is an abuse, not a proper use of the word *moderate*,
to put it for *little*.  In questions like ours, however, where all
things, and especially those addressed to the people from the place of
authority, ought to have reference to men’s salvation, and that not
their temporal but their eternal salvation, and where also the thing to
be guarded against is eternal ruin, everything that we say is important;
so much so, that even what the preacher says about pecuniary matters,
whether it have reference to loss or gain, whether the amount be great
or small, should not seem unimportant.  For justice is never
unimportant, and justice ought assuredly to be observed, even in small
affairs of money, as our Lord says:  “He that is faithful in that which
is least, is faithful also in much.” <span
id="fr_1971"></span>[1972](#fn_1971.md)   That which is least, then, is
very little; but to be faithful in that which is least is great.  For as
the nature of the circle, viz., that all lines drawn from the centre to
the circumference are equal, is the same in a great disk that it is in
the smallest coin; so the greatness of justice is in no degree lessened,
though the matters to which justice is applied be small.

<span id="v.IV_1.18-p4"></span>36.  And when the apostle spoke about
trials in regard to secular affairs (and what were these but matters of
money?), he says:  “Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go
to law before the unjust, and not before the saints?  Do ye not know
that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged
by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?  Know ye not that
we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life? 
If, then, ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them
to judge who are least esteemed in the Church.  I speak to your shame. 
Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall
be able to judge between his brethren?  But brother goeth to law with
brother, and that before the unbelievers.  Now therefore there is
utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another:  why
do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to
be defrauded?  Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that your brethren. 
Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of
God?” <span id="fr_1972"></span>[1973](#fn_1972.md)   Why is it that the
apostle is so indignant, and that he thus accuses, and upbraids, and
chides, and threatens?  Why is it that the changes in his tone, so
frequent and so abrupt, testify to the depth of his emotion?  Why is it,
in fine, that he speaks in a tone so exalted about matters so very
trifling?  Did secular matters deserve so much at his hands?  God
forbid.  No; but all this is done for the sake of justice, charity, and
piety, which in the judgment of every sober mind are great, even when
applied to matters the very least.

<span id="v.IV_1.18-p6"></span>37.  Of course, if we were giving men ad
<span id="page_587">p. 587</span> <span id="v.IV_1.18-Page_587"></span>
vice as to how they ought to conduct secular cases, either for
themselves or for their connections, before the church courts, we would
rightly advise them to conduct them quietly as matters of little
moment.  But we are treating of the manner of speech of the man who is
to be a teacher of the truths which deliver us from eternal misery and
bring us to eternal happiness; and wherever these truths are spoken of,
whether in public or private, whether to one or many, whether to friends
or enemies, whether in a continuous discourse or in conversation,
whether in tracts, or in books, or in letters long or short, they are of
great importance.  Unless indeed we are prepared to say that, because a
cup of cold water is a very trifling and common thing, the saying of our
Lord that he who gives a cup of cold water to one of His disciples shall
in no wise lose his reward, <span id="fr_1973"></span>[1974](#fn_1973.md)
is very trivial and unimportant.  Or that when a preacher takes this
saying as his text, he should think his subject very unimportant, and
therefore speak without either eloquence or power, but in a subdued and
humble style.  Is it not the case that when we happen to speak on this
subject to the people, and the presence of God is with us, so that what
we say is not altogether unworthy of the subject, a tongue of fire
springs up out of that cold water which inflames even the cold hearts of
men with a zeal for doing works of mercy in hope of an eternal reward?
