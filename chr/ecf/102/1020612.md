<span id="iv.XX.10-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XX.10-p1.1"></span>Chapter 10.—What is to Be Replied to Those Who
Think that Resurrection Pertains Only to Bodies and Not to Souls.</span>

<span id="iv.XX.10-p2"></span>There are some who suppose that
resurrection can be predicated only of the body, and therefore they
contend that this first resurrection (of the Apocalypse) is a bodily
resurrection.  For, say they, “to rise again” can only be said of things
that fall.  Now, bodies fall in death. <span
id="fr_1369"></span>[1370](#fn_1369.md)   There cannot, therefore, be a
resurrection of souls, but of bodies.  But what do they say to the
apostle who speaks of a resurrection of souls?  For certainly it was in
the inner and not the outer man that those had risen again to whom he
says, “If ye have risen with Christ, mind the things that are
above.” <span id="fr_1370"></span>[1371](#fn_1370.md)   The same sense he
elsewhere conveyed in other words, saying, “That as Christ has risen
from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we also may walk in newness
of life.” <span id="fr_1371"></span>[1372](#fn_1371.md)   So, too, “Awake
thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee
light. <span id="fr_1372"></span>[1373](#fn_1372.md) ”  As to what they say
about nothing being able to rise again but what falls, whence they
conclude that resurrection pertains to bodies only, and not to souls,
because bodies fall, why do they make nothing <span id="page_432">p.
432</span> <span id="iv.XX.10-Page_432"></span> of the words, “Ye that
fear the Lord, wait for His mercy; and go not aside lest ye fall;” <span
id="fr_1373"></span>[1374](#fn_1373.md) and “To his own Master he stands or
falls;” <span id="fr_1374"></span>[1375](#fn_1374.md) and “He that thinketh
he standeth, let him take heed lest he fall?” <span
id="fr_1375"></span>[1376](#fn_1375.md)   For I fancy this fall that we are
to take heed against is a fall of the soul, not of the body.  If, then,
rising again belongs to things that fall, and souls fall, it must be
owned that souls also rise again.  To the words, “In them the second
death hath no power,” are added the words, “but they shall be priests of
God and Christ, and shall reign with Him a thousand years;” and this
refers not to the bishops alone, and presbyters, who are now specially
called priests in the Church; but as we call all believers Christians on
account of the mystical chrism, so we call all priests because they are
members of the one Priest.  Of them the Apostle Peter says, “A holy
people, a royal priesthood.” <span id="fr_1376"></span>[1377](#fn_1376.md)
  Certainly he implied, though in a passing and incidental way, that
Christ is God, saying priests of God and Christ, that is, of the Father
and the Son, though it was in His servant-form and as Son of man that
Christ was made a Priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.  But
this we have already explained more than once.
