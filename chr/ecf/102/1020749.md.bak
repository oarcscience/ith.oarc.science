<span id="v.v.xii-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="v.v.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 12.—A Diversity of Interpretations is
Useful.  Errors Arising from Ambiguous Words.</span>

<span id="v.v.xii-p2"></span>17.  And this circumstance would assist
rather than hinder the understanding of Scripture, if only readers were
not careless.  For the examination of a number of texts has often thrown
light upon some of the more obscure passages; for example, in that
passage of the prophet Isaiah, <span
id="fr_1773"></span>[1774](#fn_1773.md) one translator reads:  “And do not
despise the domestics of thy seed;” <span
id="fr_1774"></span>[1775](#fn_1774.md) another reads:  “And do not despise
thine own flesh.” <span id="fr_1775"></span>[1776](#fn_1775.md)   Each of
these in turn confirms the other.  For the one is explained by the
other; because “flesh” may be taken in its literal sense, so that a man
may understand that he is admonished not to despise his own body; and
“the domestics of thy seed” may be understood figuratively of
Christians, because they are spiritually born of the same seed as
ourselves, namely, the Word.  When now the meaning of the two
translators is compared, a more likely sense of the words suggests
itself, viz., that the command is not to despise our kinsmen, because
when one brings the expression “domestics of thy seed” into relation
with “flesh,” kinsmen most naturally occur to one’s mind.  Whence, I
think, that expression of the apostle, when he says, “If by any means I
may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh, and might save some of
them;” <span id="fr_1776"></span>[1777](#fn_1776.md) that is, that through
emulation of those who had believed, some of them might believe too. 
And he calls the Jews his “flesh,” on account of the relationship of
blood.  Again, that passage from the same prophet Isaiah: <span
id="fr_1777"></span>[1778](#fn_1777.md)   “If ye will not believe, ye shall
not understand,” <span id="fr_1778"></span>[1779](#fn_1778.md) another has
translated:  “If ye will not believe, ye shall not abide.” <span
id="fr_1779"></span>[1780](#fn_1779.md)   Now which of these is the literal
translation cannot be ascertained without reference to the text in the
original tongue.  And yet to those who read with knowledge, a great
truth is to be found in each.  For it is difficult for interpreters to
differ so widely as not to touch at some point.  Accordingly here, as
understanding consists in sight, and is abiding, but faith feeds us as
babes, upon milk, in the cradles of temporal things (for now we walk by
faith, not by sight); <span id="fr_1780"></span>[1781](#fn_1780.md) as,
moreover, unless we walk by faith, we shall not attain to sight, which
does not pass away, but abides, our understanding being purified by
holding to the truth;—for these reasons one says, “If ye will not
believe, ye shall not understand;” but the other, “If ye will not
believe, ye shall not abide.”

<span id="v.v.xii-p11"></span>18.  And very often a translator, to whom
the meaning is not well known, is deceived by an ambiguity in the
original language, and puts upon the passage a construction that is
wholly alien to the sense of the writer.  As for example, some texts
read:  “Their feet are *sharp* to shed blood;” <span
id="fr_1781"></span>[1782](#fn_1781.md) for the word <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.v.xii-p12.2"></span>ὁζύς</span> among the
Greeks means both *sharp* and *swift*.  And so he saw the true meaning
who translated:  “Their feet are swift to shed blood.”  The other,
taking the wrong sense of an ambiguous word, fell into error.  Now
translations such as this are not obscure, but false; and there is a
wide difference between the two <span id="page_541">p. 541</span> <span
id="v.v.xii-Page_541"></span> things.  For we must learn not to
interpret, but to correct texts of this sort.  For the same reason it
is, that because the Greek word <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.v.xii-p12.3"></span>μόσχος</span> means a calf, some have not
understood that <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.v.xii-p12.4"></span>μοσχεύματα</span> <span
id="fr_1782"></span>[1783](#fn_1782.md) are shoots of trees, and have
translated the word “calves;” and this error has crept into so many
texts, that you can hardly find it written in any other way.  And yet
the meaning is very clear; for it is made evident by the words that
follow.  For “the plantings of an adulterer will not take deep
root,” <span id="fr_1783"></span>[1784](#fn_1783.md) is a more suitable
form of expression than the “calves;” <span
id="fr_1784"></span>[1785](#fn_1784.md) because these walk upon the ground
with their feet, and are not fixed in the earth by roots.  In this
passage, indeed, the rest of the context also justifies this
translation.
