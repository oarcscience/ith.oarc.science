id="iv.XIX.7-p1.1"></span>Chapter 7.—Of the Diversity of Languages, by
Which the Intercourse of Men is Prevented; And of the Misery of Wars,
Even of Those Called Just.</span>

<span id="iv.XIX.7-p2"></span>After the state or city comes the world,
the third circle of human society,—the first being the house, and the
second the city.  And the world, as it is larger, so it is fuller of
dangers, as the greater sea is the more dangerous.  And here, in the
first place, man is separated from man by the difference of languages. 
For if two men, each ignorant of the other’s language, meet, and are not
compelled to pass, but, on the contrary, to remain in company, dumb
animals, though of different species, would more easily hold intercourse
than they, human beings though they be.  For their common nature is no
help to friendliness when they are prevented by diversity of language
from conveying their sentiments to one another; so that a man would more
readily hold intercourse with his dog than with a foreigner.  But the
imperial city has endeavored to impose on subject nations not only her
yoke, but her language, as a bond of peace, so that interpreters, far
from being scarce, are numberless.  This is true; but how many great
wars, how much slaughter and bloodshed, have provided this unity!  And
though these are past, the end of these miseries has not yet come.  For
though there have never been wanting, nor are yet wanting, hostile
nations beyond the empire, against whom wars have been and are waged,
yet, supposing there were no such nations, the very extent of the empire
itself has produced wars of a more obnoxious description—social and
civil wars—and with these the whole race has been agitated, either by
the actual conflict or the fear of a renewed outbreak.  If I attempted
to give an adequate description of these manifold disasters, these stern
and lasting necessities, though I am quite unequal to the task, what
limit could I set?  But, say they, the wise man will wage just wars.  As
if he would not all the rather lament the necessity of just wars, if he
remembers that he is a man; for if they were not just he would not wage
them, and would therefore be delivered from all wars.  For it is the
wrongdoing of the opposing party which compels the wise man to wage just
wars; and this wrong-doing, even though it gave rise to no war, would
still be matter of grief to man because it is man’s wrong-doing.  Let
every one, then, who thinks with pain on all these great evils, so
horrible, so ruthless, acknowledge that this is misery.  And if any one
either endures or thinks of them without mental pain, this is a more
miserable plight still, for he thinks himself happy because he has lost
human feeling.
