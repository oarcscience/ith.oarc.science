id="iv.XVI.18-p1.1"></span>Chapter 18.—Of the Repeated Address of God to
Abraham, in Which He Promised the Land of Canaan to Him and to His
Seed.</span>

<span id="iv.XVI.18-p2"></span>Abraham, then, having departed out of
Haran in the seventy-fifth year of his own age, and in the hundred and
forty-fifth of his father’s, went with Lot, his brother’s son, and Sarah
his wife, into the land of Canaan, and came even to Sichem, where again
he received the divine oracle, of which it is thus written:  “And the
Lord appeared unto Abram, and said unto him, Unto thy seed will I give
this land.” <span id="fr_903"></span>[904](#fn_903.md)   Nothing is
promised here about that seed in which he is made the <span
id="page_322">p. 322</span> <span id="iv.XVI.18-Page_322"></span> father
of all nations, but only about that by which he is the father of the one
Israelite nation; for by this seed that land was possessed.
