<span id="iv.ii.xxix-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.ii.xxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 28.—By What Judgment of God the
Enemy Was Permitted to Indulge His Lust on the Bodies of Continent
Christians.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.xxix-p2"></span>Let not your life, then, be a burden to
you, ye faithful servants of Christ, though your chastity was made the
sport of your enemies.  You have a grand and true consolation, if you
maintain a good conscience, and know that you did not consent to the
sins of those who were permitted to commit sinful outrage upon you.  And
if you should ask why this permission was granted, indeed it is a deep
providence of the Creator and Governor of the world; and “unsearchable
are His judgments, and His ways past finding out.” <span
id="fr_81"></span>[82](#fn_81.md)   Nevertheless, faithfully interrogate
your own souls, whether ye have not been unduly puffed up by your
integrity, and continence, and chastity; and whether ye have not been so
desirous of the human praise that is accorded to these virtues, that ye
have envied some who possessed them.  I, for my part, do not know your
hearts, and therefore I make no accusation; I do not even hear what your
hearts answer when you question them.  And yet, if they answer that it
is as I have supposed it might be, do not marvel that you have lost that
by which you can win men’s praise, and retain that which cannot be
exhibited to men.  If you did not consent to sin, it was because God
added His aid to His grace that it might not be lost, and because shame
before men succeeded to human glory that it might not be loved.  But in
both respects even the faint-hearted among you have a consolation,
approved by the one experience, chastened by the other; justified by the
one, corrected by the other.  As to those whose hearts, when
interrogated, reply that they have never been proud of the virtue of
virginity, widowhood, or matrimonial chastity, but, condescending to
those of low estate, rejoiced with trembling in these gifts of God, and
that they have never envied any one the like excellences of sanctity and
purity, but rose superior to human applause, which is wont to be
abundant in proportion to the rarity of the virtue applauded, and rather
desired that their own number be increased, <span id="page_19">p.
19</span> <span id="iv.ii.xxix-Page_19"></span> than that by the
smallness of their numbers each of them should be conspicuous;—even such
faithful women, I say, must not complain that permission was given to
the barbarians so grossly to outrage them; nor must they allow
themselves to believe that God overlooked their character when He
permitted acts which no one with impunity commits.  For some most
flagrant and wicked desires are allowed free play at present by the
secret judgment of God, and are reserved to the public and final
judgment.  Moreover, it is possible that those Christian women, who are
unconscious of any undue pride on account of their virtuous chastity,
whereby they sinlessly suffered the violence of their captors, had yet
some lurking infirmity which might have betrayed them into a proud and
contemptuous bearing, had they not been subjected to the humiliation
that befell them in the taking of the city.  As, therefore, some men
were removed by death, that no wickedness might change their
disposition, so these women were outraged lest prosperity should corrupt
their modesty.  Neither those women then, who were already puffed up by
the circumstance that they were still virgins, nor those who might have
been so puffed up had they not been exposed to the violence of the
enemy, lost their chastity, but rather gained humility; the former were
saved from pride already cherished, the latter from pride that would
shortly have grown upon them.

<span id="iv.ii.xxix-p4"></span>We must further notice that some of
those sufferers may have conceived that continence is a bodily good, and
abides so long as the body is inviolate, and did not understand that the
purity both of the body and the soul rests on the steadfastness of the
will strengthened by God’s grace, and cannot be forcibly taken from an
unwilling person.  From this error they are probably now delivered.  For
when they reflect how conscientiously they served God, and when they
settle again to the firm persuasion that He can in nowise desert those
who so serve Him, and so invoke His aid and when they consider, what
they cannot doubt, how pleasing to Him is chastity, they are shut up to
the conclusion that He could never have permitted these disasters to
befall His saints, if by them that saintliness could be destroyed which
He Himself had bestowed upon them, and delights to see in them.
