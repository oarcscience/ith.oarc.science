<span id="iv.XIII.2-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XIII.2-p1.1"></span>Chapter 2.—Of that Death Which Can Affect an
Immortal Soul, and of that to Which the Body is Subject.</span>

<span id="iv.XIII.2-p2"></span>But I see I must speak a little more
carefully of the nature of death.  For although the human soul is truly
affirmed to be immortal, yet it also has a certain death of its own. 
For it is therefore called immortal, because, in a sense, it does not
cease to live and to feel; while the body is called mortal, because it
can be forsaken of all life, and cannot by itself live at all.  The
death, then, of the soul takes place when God forsakes it, as the death
of the body when the soul forsakes it.  Therefore the death of both—that
is, of the whole man—occurs when the soul, forsaken by God, forsakes the
body.  For, in this case, neither is God the life of the soul, nor the
soul the life of the body.  And this death of the whole man is followed
by that which, on the authority of the divine oracles, we call the
second death.  This the Saviour referred to when He said, “Fear Him
which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.” <span
id="fr_577"></span>[578](#fn_577.md)   And since this does not happen
before the soul is so joined to its body that they cannot be separated
at all, it may be matter of wonder how the body can be said to be killed
by that death in which it is not forsaken by the soul, but, being
animated and rendered sensitive by it, is tormented.  For in that penal
and everlasting punishment, of which in its own place we are to speak
more at large, the soul is justly said to die, because it does not live
in connection with God; but how can we say that the body is dead, seeing
that it lives by the soul?  For it could not otherwise feel the bodily
torments which are to follow the resurrection.  Is it because life of
every kind is good, and pain an evil, that we decline to say that that
body lives, in which the soul is the cause, not of life, but of pain? 
The soul, then, lives by God when it lives well, for it cannot live well
unless by God working in it what is good; and the body lives by the soul
when the soul lives in the body, whether itself be living by God or no. 
For the wicked man’s life in the body is a life not of the soul, but of
the body, which even dead souls—that is, souls forsaken of God—can
confer upon bodies, how little so-ever of their own proper life, by
which they are immortal, they retain.  But in the last damnation, though
man does not cease to feel, yet because this feeling of his is neither
sweet with pleasure nor wholesome with repose, but painfully penal, it
is not without reason called death rather than life.  And it is called
the second death because it follows the first, which sunders the two
cohering essences, whether <span id="page_246">p. 246</span> <span
id="iv.XIII.2-Page_246"></span> these be God and the soul, or the soul
and the body.  Of the first and bodily death, then, we may say that to
the good it is good, and evil to the evil.  But, doubtless, the second,
as it happens to none of the good, so it can be good for none.
