<span id="iv.XII.23-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XII.23-p1.1"></span>Chapter 23.—Of the Nature of the Human Soul
Created in the Image of God.</span>

<span id="iv.XII.23-p2"></span>God, then, made man in His own image. 
For He created for him a soul endowed with reason and intelligence, so
that he might excel all the creatures of earth, air, and sea, which were
not so gifted.  And when He had formed the man out of the dust of the
earth, and had willed that his soul should be such as I have
said,—whether He had already made it, and now by breathing imparted it
to man, or rather made it by breathing, so that that breath which God
made by breathing <span id="page_242">p. 242</span> <span
id="iv.XII.23-Page_242"></span> (for what else is “to breathe” than to
make breath?) is the soul, <span id="fr_566"></span>[567](#fn_566.md) —He
made also a wife for him, to aid him in the work of generating his kind,
and her He formed of a bone taken out of the man’s side, working in a
divine manner.  For we are not to conceive of this work in a carnal
fashion, as if God wrought as we commonly see artisans, who use their
hands, and material furnished to them, that by their artistic skill they
may fashion some material object.  God’s hand is God’s power; and He,
working invisibly, effects visible results.  But this seems fabulous
rather than true to men, who measure by customary and everyday works the
power and wisdom of God, whereby He understands and produces without
seeds even seeds themselves; and because they cannot understand the
things which at the beginning were created, they are sceptical regarding
them—as if the very things which they do know about human propagation,
conceptions and births, would seem less incredible if told to those who
had no experience of them; though these very things, too, are attributed
by many rather to physical and natural causes than to the work of the
divine mind.
