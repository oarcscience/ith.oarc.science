<span id="iv.VIII.13-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.VIII.13-p1.1"></span>Chapter 13.—Concerning the Opinion of Plato,
According to Which He Defined the Gods as Beings Entirely Good and the
Friends of Virtue.</span>

<span id="iv.VIII.13-p2"></span>Therefore, although in many other
important respects they differ from us, nevertheless with respect to
this particular point of difference, which I have just stated, as it is
one of <span id="page_153">p. 153</span> <span
id="iv.VIII.13-Page_153"></span> great moment, and the question on hand
concerns it, I will first ask them to what gods they think that sacred
rites are to be performed,—to the good or to the bad, or to both the
good and the bad?  But we have the opinion of Plato affirming that all
the gods are good, and that there is not one of the gods bad.  It
follows, therefore, that these are to be performed to the good, for then
they are performed to gods; for if they are not good, neither are they
gods.  Now, if this be the case (for what else ought we to believe
concerning the gods?), certainly it explodes the opinion that the bad
gods are to be propitiated by sacred rites in order that they may not
harm us, but the good gods are to be invoked in order that they may
assist us.  For there are no bad gods, and it is to the good that, as
they say, the due honor of such rites is to be paid.  Of what character,
then, are those gods who love scenic displays, even demanding that a
place be given them among divine things, and that they be exhibited in
their honor?  The power of these gods proves that they exist, but their
liking such things proves that they are bad.  For it is well-known what
Plato’s opinion was concerning scenic plays.  He thinks that the poets
themselves, because they have composed songs so unworthy of the majesty
and goodness of the gods, ought to be banished from the state.  Of what
character, therefore, are those gods who contend with Plato himself
about those scenic plays?  He does not suffer the gods to be defamed by
false crimes; the gods command those same crimes to be celebrated in
their own honor.

<span id="iv.VIII.13-p3"></span>In fine, when they ordered these plays
to be inaugurated, they not only demanded base things, but also did
cruel things, taking from Titus Latinius his son, and sending a disease
upon him because he had refused to obey them, which they removed when he
had fulfilled their commands.  Plato, however, bad though they were, did
not think they were to be feared; but, holding to his opinion with the
utmost firmness and constancy, does not hesitate to remove from a
well-ordered state all the sacrilegious follies of the poets, with which
these gods are delighted because they themselves are impure.  But Labeo
places this same Plato (as I have mentioned already in the second
book <span id="fr_311"></span>[312](#fn_311) .md) among the demi-gods.  Now
Labeo thinks that the bad deities are to be propitiated with bloody
victims, and by fasts accompanied with the same, but the good deities
with plays, and all other things which are associated with joyfulness. 
How comes it, then, that the demi-god Plato so persistently dares to
take away those pleasures, because he deems them base, not from the
demi-gods but from the gods, and these the good gods?  And, moreover,
those very gods themselves do certainly refute the opinion of Labeo, for
they showed themselves in the case of Latinius to be not only wanton and
sportive, but also cruel and terrible.  Let the Platonists, therefore,
explain these things to us, since, following the opinion of their
master, they think that all the gods are good and honorable, and
friendly to the virtues of the wise, holding it unlawful to think
otherwise concerning any of the gods.  We will explain it, say they. 
Let us then attentively listen to them.
