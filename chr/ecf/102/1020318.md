<span id="iv.XI.14-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XI.14-p1.1"></span>Chapter 14.—An Explanation of What is Said of
the Devil, that He Did Not Abide in the Truth, Because the Truth Was Not
in Him.</span>

<span id="iv.XI.14-p2"></span>Moreover, as if we had been inquiring why
the devil did not abide in the truth, our Lord subjoins the reason,
saying, “because the truth is not in him.”  Now, it would be in him had
he abode in it.  But the phraseology is unusual.  For, as the words
stand, “He abode not in the truth, because the truth is not in him,” it
seems as if the truth’s not being in him were the cause of his not
abiding in it; whereas his not abiding in the truth is rather the cause
of its not being in him.  The same form of speech is found in the
psalm:  “I have called upon Thee, for Thou hast heard me, O God,” <span
id="fr_477"></span>[478](#fn_477) where we should expect it to be said,
Thou hast heard me, O God, for I have called upon Thee.  But when he had
said, “I have called,” then, as if some one were seeking proof of this,
he demonstrates the effectual earnestness of his prayer by the effect of
God’s hearing it; as if he had said, The proof that I have prayed is
that Thou hast heard me.
