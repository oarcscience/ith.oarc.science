id="iv.XVIII.15-p1.1"></span>Chapter 15.—Of the Fall of the Kingdom of
Argos, When Picus the Son of Saturn First Received His Father’s Kingdom
of Laurentum.</span>

<span id="iv.XVIII.15-p2"></span>During those times the kingdom of Argos
came to an end; being transferred to Mycene, from which Agamemnon came,
and the kingdom of Laurentum arose, of which Picus son of Saturn was the
first king, when the woman Deborah judged the Hebrews; but it was the
Spirit of God who used her as His agent, for she was also a prophetess,
although her prophecy is so obscure that we could not demonstrate,
without a long discussion, that it was uttered concerning Christ.  Now
the Laurentes already reigned in Italy, from whom the origin of the
Roman people is quite evidently derived after the Greeks; yet the
kingdom of Assyria still lasted, in which Lampares was the twenty-third
king when Picus first began to reign at Laurentum.  The worshippers of
such gods may see what they are to think of Saturn the father of Picus,
who deny that he was a man; of whom some also have written that he
himself reigned in Italy before Picus his son; and Virgil in his
well-known book says,

<span id="iv.XVIII.15-p3"></span>“That race indocile, and through
mountains high

<span id="iv.XVIII.15-p4"></span>Dispersed, he settled, and endowed with
laws,

<span id="iv.XVIII.15-p5"></span>And named their country Latium, because

<span id="page_369">p. 369</span> <span
id="iv.XVIII.15-Page_369"></span>

<span id="iv.XVIII.15-p6"></span>Latent within their coasts he dwelt
secure.

<span id="iv.XVIII.15-p7"></span>Tradition says the golden ages pure

<span id="iv.XVIII.15-p8"></span>Began when he was king.” <span
id="fr_1139"></span>[1140](#fn_1139)

<span id="iv.XVIII.15-p10"></span>But they regard these as poetic
fancies, and assert that the father of Picus was Sterces rather, and
relate that, being a most skillful husbandman, he discovered that the
fields could be fertilized by the dung of animals, which is called
*stercus* from his name.  Some say he was called Stercutius.  But for
whatever reason they chose to call him Saturn, it is yet certain they
made this Sterces or Stercutius a god for his merit in agriculture; and
they likewise received into the number of these gods Picus his son, whom
they affirm to have been a famous augur and warrior.  Picus begot
Faunus, the second king of Laurentum; and he too is, or was, a god with
them.  These divine honors they gave to dead men before the Trojan war.
