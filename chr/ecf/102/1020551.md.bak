<span id="iv.XVIII.33-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XVIII.33-p1.1"></span>Chapter 33.—What Jeremiah and Zephaniah
Have, by the Prophetic Spirit, Spoken Before Concerning Christ and the
Calling of the Nations.</span>

<span id="iv.XVIII.33-p2"></span>Jeremiah, like Isaiah, is one of the
greater prophets, not of the minor, like the others from whose writings
I have just given extracts.  He prophesied when Josiah reigned in
Jerusalem, and Ancus Martius at Rome, when the captivity of the Jews was
already at hand; and he continued to prophesy down to the fifth month of
the captivity, as we find from his writings.  Zephaniah, one of the
minor prophets, is put along with him, because he himself says that he
prophesied in the days of Josiah; but he does not say till when. 
Jeremiah thus prophesied not only in the times of Ancus Martius, but
also in those of Tarquinius Priscus, whom the Romans had for their fifth
king.  For he had already begun to reign when that captivity took
place.  Jeremiah, in prophesying of Christ, says, “The breath of our
mouth, the Lord Christ, was taken in our sins,” <span
id="fr_1187"></span>[1188](#fn_1187.md) thus briefly showing both that
Christ is our Lord and that He suffered for us.  Also in another place
he says, “This is my God, and there shall none other be accounted of in
comparison of Him; who hath found out all the way of prudence, and hath
given it to Jacob His servant, and to Israel His beloved:  afterwards He
was seen on the earth, and conversed with men.” <span
id="fr_1188"></span>[1189](#fn_1188.md)   Some attribute this testimony not
to Jeremiah, but to his secretary, who was called Baruch; but it is more
commonly ascribed to Jeremiah.  Again the same prophet says concerning
Him, “Behold the days come, saith the Lord, that I will raise up unto
David a righteous shoot, and a King shall reign and shall be wise, and
shall do judgment and justice in the earth.  In those days Judah shall
be saved, and Israel shall dwell confidently:  and this is the name
which they shall call Him, Our righteous Lord.” <span
id="fr_1189"></span>[1190](#fn_1189.md)   And of the calling of the nations
which was to come to pass, and which we now see fulfilled, he thus
spoke:  “O Lord my God, and my refuge in the day of evils, to Thee shall
the nations come from <span id="page_380">p. 380</span> <span
id="iv.XVIII.33-Page_380"></span> the utmost end of the earth, saying,
Truly our fathers have worshipped lying images, wherein there is no
profit.” <span id="fr_1190"></span>[1191](#fn_1190.md)   But that the Jews,
by whom He behoved even to be slain, were not going to acknowledge Him,
this prophet thus intimates:  “Heavy is the heart through all; and He is
a man, and who shall know Him?” <span
id="fr_1191"></span>[1192](#fn_1191.md)   That passage also is his which I
have quoted in the seventeenth book concerning the new testament, of
which Christ is the Mediator.  For Jeremiah himself says, “Behold, the
days come, saith the Lord, that I will complete over the house of Jacob
a new testament,” and the rest, which may be read there. <span
id="fr_1192"></span>[1193](#fn_1192.md)

<span id="iv.XVIII.33-p9"></span>For the present I shall put down those
predictions about Christ by the prophet Zephaniah, who prophesied with
Jeremiah.  “Wait ye upon me, saith the Lord, in the day of my
resurrection, in the future; because it is my determination to assemble
the nations, and gather together the kingdoms.” <span
id="fr_1193"></span>[1194](#fn_1193.md)   And again he says, “The Lord will
be terrible upon them, and will exterminate all the gods of the earth;
and they shall worship Him every man from his place, even all the isles
of the nations.” <span id="fr_1194"></span>[1195](#fn_1194.md)   And a
little after he says, “Then will I turn to the people a tongue, and to
His offspring, that they may call upon the name of the Lord, and serve
Him under one yoke.  From the borders of the rivers of Ethiopia shall
they bring sacrifices unto me.  In that day thou shall not be confounded
for all thy curious inventions, which thou hast done impiously against
me:  for then I will take away from thee the haughtiness of thy
trespass; and thou shalt no more magnify thyself above thy holy
mountain.  And I will leave in thee a meek and humble people, and they
who shall be left of Israel shall fear the name of the Lord.” <span
id="fr_1195"></span>[1196](#fn_1195.md)   These are the remnant of whom the
apostle quotes that which is elsewhere prophesied:  “Though the number
of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be
saved.” <span id="fr_1196"></span>[1197](#fn_1196.md)   These are the
remnant of that nation who have believed in Christ.
