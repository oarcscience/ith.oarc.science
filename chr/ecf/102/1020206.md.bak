<span id="iv.VII.23-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.VII.23-p1.1"></span>Chapter 23.—Concerning the Earth, Which Varro
Affirms to Be a Goddess, Because that Soul of the World Which He Thinks
to Be God Pervades Also This Lowest Part of His Body, and Imparts to It
a Divine Force.</span>

<span id="iv.VII.23-p2"></span>Surely the earth, which we see full of
its own living creatures, is one; but for all that, it is but a mighty
mass among the elements, <span id="page_135">p. 135</span> <span
id="iv.VII.23-Page_135"></span> and the lowest part of the world.  Why,
then, would they have it to be a goddess?  Is it because it is
fruitful?  Why, then, are not men rather held to be gods, who render it
fruitful by cultivating it; but though they plough it, do not adore it? 
But, say they, the part of the soul of the world which pervades it makes
it a goddess.  As if it were not a far more evident thing, nay, a thing
which is not called in question, that there is a soul in man.  And yet
men are not held to be gods, but (a thing to be sadly lamented), with
wonderful and pitiful delusion, are subjected to those who are not gods,
and than whom they themselves are better, as the objects of deserved
worship and adoration.  And certainly the same Varro, in the book
concerning the select gods, affirms that there are three grades of soul
in universal nature.  One which pervades all the living parts of the
body, and has not sensation, but only the power of life,—that principle
which penetrates into the bones, nails and hair.  By this principle in
the world trees are nourished, and grow without being possessed of
sensation, and live in a manner peculiar to themselves.  The second
grade of soul is that in which there is sensation.  This principle
penetrates into the eyes, ears, nostrils, mouth, and the organs of
sensation.  The third grade of soul is the highest, and is called mind,
where intelligence has its throne.  This grade of soul no mortal
creatures except man are possessed of.  Now this part of the soul of the
world, Varro says, is called God, and in us is called Genius.  And the
stones and earth in the world, which we see, and which are not pervaded
by the power of sensation, are, as it were, the bones and nails of God. 
Again, the sun, moon, and stars, which we perceive, and by which He
perceives, are His organs of perception.  Moreover, the ether is His
mind; and by the virtue which is in it, which penetrates into the stars,
it also makes them gods; and because it penetrates through them into the
earth, it makes it the goddess Tellus, whence again it enters and
permeates the sea and ocean, making them the god Neptune.

<span id="iv.VII.23-p3"></span>Let him return from this, which he thinks
to be natural theology, back to that from which he went out, in order to
rest from the fatigue occasioned by the many turnings and windings of
his path.  Let him return, I say, let him return to the civil theology. 
I wish to detain him there a while.  I have somewhat to say which has to
do with that theology.  I am not yet saying, that if the earth and
stones are similar to our bones and nails, they are in like manner
devoid of intelligence, as they are devoid of sensation.  Nor am I
saying that, if our bones and nails are said to have intelligence,
because they are in a man who has intelligence, he who says that the
things analogous to these in the world are gods, is as stupid as he is
who says that our bones and nails are men.  We shall perhaps have
occasion to dispute these things with the philosophers.  At present,
however, I wish to deal with Varro as a political theologian.  For it is
possible that, though he may seem to have wished to lift up his head, as
it were, into the liberty of natural theology, the consciousness that
the book with which he was occupied was one concerning a subject
belonging to civil theology, may have caused him to relapse into the
point of view of that theology, and to say this in order that the
ancestors of his nation, and other states, might not be believed to have
bestowed on Neptune an irrational worship.  What I am to say is this: 
Since the earth is one, why has not that part of the soul of the world
which permeates the earth made it that one goddess which he calls
Tellus?  But had it done so, what then had become of Orcus, the brother
of Jupiter and Neptune, whom they call Father Dis? <span
id="fr_281"></span>[282](#fn_281.md)   And where, in that case, had been
his wife Proserpine, who, according to another opinion given in the same
book, is called, not the fecundity of the earth, but its lower
part? <span id="fr_282"></span>[283](#fn_282.md)   But if they say that
part of the soul of the world, when it permeates the upper part of the
earth, makes the god Father Dis, but when it pervades the nether part of
the same the goddess Proserpine; what, in that case, will that Tellus
be?  For all that which she was has been divided into these two parts,
and these two gods; so that it is impossible to find what to make or
where to place her as a third goddess, except it be said that those
divinities Orcus and Proserpine are the one goddess Tellus, and that
they are not three gods, but one or two, whilst notwithstanding they are
called three, held to be three, worshipped as three, having their own
several altars, their own shrines, rites, images, priests, whilst their
own false demons also through these things defile the prostituted soul. 
Let this further question be answered:  What part of the earth does a
part of the soul of the world permeate in order to make the god
Tellumo?  No, says he; but the earth being one and the same, has a
double life,—the masculine, which produces seed, and the feminine, which
receives and nourishes the seed.  Hence it has been called Tellus from
the feminine principle, and Tellumo from the masculine.  Why, then, do
the priests, as he <span id="page_136">p. 136</span> <span
id="iv.VII.23-Page_136"></span> indicates, perform divine service to
four gods, two others being added,—namely, to Tellus, Tellumo, Altor,
and Rusor?  We have already spoken concerning Tellus and Tellumo.  But
why do they worship Altor? <span id="fr_283"></span>[284](#fn_283.md)  
Because, says he, all that springs of the earth is nourished by the
earth.  Wherefore do they worship Rusor? <span
id="fr_284"></span>[285](#fn_284.md)   Because all things return back again
to the place whence they proceeded.
