complete attainment of all we desire is that which constitutes felicity,
which is no goddess, but a gift of God, and that therefore men can
worship no god save Him who is able to make them happy,—and were
Felicity herself a goddess, she would with reason be the only object of
worship,—since, I say, this is established, let us now go on to consider
why God, who is able to give with all other things those good gifts
which can be possessed by men who are not good, and consequently not
happy, has seen fit to grant such extended and long-continued dominion
to the Roman empire; for that this was not effected by that multitude of
false gods which they worshipped, we have both already adduced, and
shall, as occasion offers, yet adduce considerable proof.
