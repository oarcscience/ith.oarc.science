<span id="iv.XVI.1-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XVI.1-p1.1"></span>Chapter 1.—Whether, After the Deluge, from
Noah to Abraham, Any Families Can Be Found Who Lived According to
God.</span>

<span id="iv.XVI.1-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.XVI.1-p2.1"></span>It</span> is difficult to discover from
Scripture, whether, after the deluge, traces of the holy city are
continuous, or are so interrupted by intervening seasons of godlessness,
that not a single worshipper of the one true God was found among men;
because from Noah, who, with his wife, three sons, and as many
daughters-in-law, achieved deliverance in the ark from the destruction
of the deluge, down to Abraham, we do not find in the canonical books
that the piety of any one is celebrated by express divine testimony,
unless it be in the case of Noah, who commends with a prophetic
benediction his two sons Shem and Japheth, while he beheld and foresaw
what was long afterwards to happen.  It was also by this prophetic
spirit that, when his middle son—that is, the son who was younger than
the first and older than the last born—had sinned against him, he cursed
him not in his own person, but in his son’s (his own grandson’s), in the
words, “Cursed be the lad Canaan; a servant shall he be unto his
brethren.” <span id="fr_857"></span>[858](#fn_857)   Now Canaan was born
of Ham, who, so far from covering his sleeping father’s nakedness, had
divulged it.  For the same reason also he subjoins the blessing on his
two other sons, the oldest and youngest, saying, “Blessed be the Lord
God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.  God shall gladden
Japheth, and he shall dwell in the houses of Shem.” <span
id="fr_858"></span>[859](#fn_858)   And so, too, the planting of the
vine by Noah, and his intoxication by its fruit, and his nakedness while
he slept, and the other things done at that time, and recorded, are all
of them pregnant with prophetic meanings, and veiled in mysteries. <span
