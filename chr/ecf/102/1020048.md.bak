<span id="iv.II_1.5-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.II_1.5-p1.1"></span>Chapter 5.—Of the Obscenities Practiced in
Honor of the Mother of the Gods.</span>

<span id="iv.II_1.5-p2"></span>In this matter I would prefer to have as
my assessors in judgment, not those men who rather take pleasure in
these infamous customs than take pains to put an end to them, but that
same Scipio Nasica who was chosen by the senate as the citizen most
worthy to receive in his hands the image of that demon Cybele, and
convey it into the city.  He would tell us whether he would be proud to
see his own mother so highly esteemed by the state as to have divine
honors adjudged to her; as the Greeks and Romans and other nations have
decreed divine honors to men who had been of material service to them,
and have believed that their mortal benefactors were thus made immortal,
and enrolled among the gods. <span id="fr_92"></span>[93](#fn_92.md)  
Surely he would desire that his mother should enjoy such felicity were
it possible.  But if we proceeded to ask him whether, among the honors
paid to her, he would wish such shameful rites as these to be
celebrated, would he not at once exclaim that he would rather his mother
lay stone-dead, than survive as a goddess to lend her ear to these
obscenities?  Is it possible that he who was of so severe a morality,
that he used his influence as a Roman senator to prevent the building of
a theatre in that city dedicated to the manly virtues, would wish his
mother to be propitiated as a goddess with words which would have
brought the blush to her cheek when a Roman matron?  Could he possibly
believe that the modesty of an estimable woman would be so transformed
by her promotion to divinity, that she would suffer herself to be
invoked and celebrated in terms so gross and immodest, that if she had
heard the like while alive upon earth, and had listened without stopping
her ears and hurrying from the spot, her relatives, her husband, and her
children would have blushed for her?  Therefore, the mother of the gods
being such a character as the most profligate man would be ashamed to
have for his mother, and meaning to enthral the minds of the Romans,
demanded for her service their best citizen, not to ripen him still more
in virtue by her helpful counsel, but to entangle him by her deceit,
like her of whom it is written, “The adulteress will hunt for the
precious soul.” <span id="fr_93"></span>[94](#fn_93.md)   Her intent was to
puff up this high- <span id="page_26">p. 26</span> <span
id="iv.II_1.5-Page_26"></span> souled man by an apparently divine
testimony to his excellence, in order that he might rely upon his own
eminence in virtue, and make no further efforts after true piety and
religion, without which natural genius, however brilliant, vapors into
pride and comes to nothing.  For what but a guileful purpose could that
goddess demand the best man seeing that in her own sacred festivals she
requires such obscenities as the best men would be covered with shame to
hear at their own tables?
