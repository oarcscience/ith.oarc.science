<span id="iv.XI.1-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XI.1-p1.1"></span>Chapter 1.—Of This Part of the Work, Wherein We
Begin to Explain the Origin and End of the Two Cities.</span>

<span id="iv.XI.1-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.XI.1-p2.1"></span>The</span> city of God we speak of is the same
to which testimony is borne by that Scripture, which excels all the
writings of all nations by its divine authority, and has brought under
its influence all kinds of minds, and this not by a casual intellectual
movement, but obviously by an express providential arrangement.  For
there it is written, “Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of
God.” <span id="fr_445"></span>[446](#fn_445.md)   And in another psalm we
read, “Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised in the city of our
God, in the mountain of His holiness, increasing the joy of the whole
earth.” <span id="fr_446"></span>[447](#fn_446.md)   And, a little after,
in the same psalm, “As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the
Lord of hosts, in the city of our God.  God has established it for
ever.”  And in another, “There is a river the streams whereof shall make
glad the city of our God, the holy place of the tabernacles of the Most
High.  God is in the midst of her, she shall not be moved.” <span
id="fr_447"></span>[448](#fn_447.md)   From these and similar testimonies,
all of which it were tedious to cite, we have learned that there is a
city of God, and its Founder has inspired us with a love which makes us
covet its citizenship.  To this Founder of the holy city the citizens of
the earthly city prefer their own gods, not knowing that He is the God
of gods, not of false, *i.e*., of impious and proud gods, who, being
deprived of His unchangeable and freely communicated light, and so
reduced to a kind of poverty-stricken power, eagerly grasp at their own
private privileges, and seek divine honors from their deluded subjects;
but of the pious and holy gods, who are better pleased to submit
themselves to one, than to subject many to themselves, and who would
rather worship God than be worshipped as God.  But to the enemies of
this city we have replied in the ten preceding books, according to our
ability and the help afforded by our Lord and King.  Now, recognizing
what is expected of me, and not unmindful of my promise, and relying,
too, on the same succor, I will endeavor to treat of the origin, and
progress, and deserved destinies of the two cities (the earthly and the
heavenly, to wit), which, as we said, are in this present world
commingled, and as it were entangled together.  And, first, I will
explain how the foundations of these two cities were originally laid, in
the difference that arose among the angels.
