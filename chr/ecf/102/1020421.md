<span id="iv.XV-p3"></span>Argument—Having treated in the four preceding
books of the origin of the two cities, the earthly and the heavenly,
Augustin explains their growth and progress in the four books which
follow; and, in order to do so, he explains the chief passages of the
sacred history which bear upon this subject.  In this fifteenth book he
opens this part of his work by explaining the events recorded in Genesis
from the time of Cain and Abel to the deluge.
