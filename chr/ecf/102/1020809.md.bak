<span id="v.vi.xxix-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="v.vi.xxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 29.—The Knowledge of Tropes is
Necessary.</span>

<span id="v.vi.xxix-p2"></span>40.  Moreover, I would have learned men
to know that the authors of our Scriptures use all those forms of
expression which grammarians call by the Greek name *tropes*, and use
them more freely and in greater variety than people who are unacquainted
with the Scriptures, and have learnt these figures of speech from other
writings, can imagine or believe.  Nevertheless those who know these
tropes recognize them in Scripture, and are very much assisted by their
knowledge of them in understanding Scripture.  But this is not the place
to teach them to the illiterate, lest it might seem that I was teaching
grammar.  I certainly advise, however, that they be learnt elsewhere,
although indeed I have already given that advice above, in the second
book—namely, where I treated of the necessary knowledge of languages. 
For the written characters from which grammar itself gets its name (the
Greek name for letters being <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.vi.xxix-p2.1"></span>γράμματα</span> are the signs of sounds made
by the articulate voice with which we speak.  Now of some of these
figures of speech we find in Scripture not only examples (which we have
of them all), but the very names as well:  for instance, *allegory,
enigma*, and *parable*.  However, nearly all these tropes which are said
to be learnt as a matter of liberal education are found even in the
ordinary speech of men who have learnt no grammar, but are content to
use the vulgar idiom.  For who does not say, “So may you flourish?”  And
this is the figure of speech called *metaphor*.  Who does not speak of a
fish-pond <span id="fr_1895"></span>[1896](#fn_1895.md) in which there is
no fish, which was not made for fish, and yet gets its name from fish? 
And this is the figure called *catachresis*.

<span id="v.vi.xxix-p4"></span>41.  It would be tedious to go over all
the rest in this way; for the speech of the vulgar makes use of them
all, even of those more curious figures which mean the very opposite of
what they say, as for example, those called *irony* and *antiphrasis*. 
Now in irony we indicate by the tone of voice the meaning we desire to
convey; as when we say to a man who is behaving badly, “You are doing
well.”  But it is not by the tone of voice that we make an antiphrasis
to indicate the opposite of what the words convey; but either the words
in which it is expressed are used in the opposite of their etymological
sense, as a grove is called *lucus* from its want of light; <span
id="fr_1896"></span>[1897](#fn_1896.md) or it is customary to use a certain
form of expression, although it puts *yes* for *no* by a law of
contraries, as when we ask in a place for what is not there, and get the
answer, “There is plenty;” or we add words that make it plain we mean
the opposite of what we say, as in the expression, “Beware of him, for
he is a good man.”  And what illiterate man is there that does not use
such expressions, although he knows nothing <span id="page_568">p.
568</span> <span id="v.vi.xxix-Page_568"></span> at all about either the
nature or the names of these figures of speech?  And yet the knowledge
of these is necessary for clearing up the difficulties of Scripture;
because when the words taken literally give an absurd meaning, we ought
forthwith to inquire whether they may not be used in this or that
figurative sense which we are unacquainted with; and in this way many
obscure passages have had light thrown upon them.

<span id="v.vi.xxix-p3"></span> The word *piscina* (literally a
*fish-pond*) was used in post-Augustan times for any pool of water, a
swimming pond, for instance, or a pond for cattle to drink from.
