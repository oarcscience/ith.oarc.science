<span id="iv.XXI.21-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XXI.21-p1.1"></span>Chapter 21.—Of Those Who Assert that All
Catholics Who Continue in the Faith Even Though by the Depravity of
Their Lives They Have Merited Hell Fire, Shall Be Saved on Account of
the “Foundation” Of Their Faith.</span>

<span id="iv.XXI.21-p2"></span>There are some, too, who found upon the
expression of Scripture, “He that endureth to the end shall be
saved,” <span id="fr_1534"></span>[1535](#fn_1534.md) and who promise
salvation only to those who continue in the Church catholic; and though
such persons have lived badly, yet, say they, they shall be saved as by
fire through virtue of the foundation of which the apostle says, “For
other foundation hath no man laid than that which is laid, which is
Christ Jesus.  Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver,
precious stones, wood, hay, stubble; every man’s work shall be made
manifest:  for the day of the Lord shall declare it, for it shall be
revealed by fire; and each man’s work shall be proved of what sort it
is.  If any man’s work shall endure which he hath built thereupon, he
shall receive a reward.  But if any man’s work shall be burned, he shall
suffer loss:  but he himself shall be saved; yet so as through
fire.” <span id="fr_1535"></span>[1536](#fn_1535.md)   They say,
accordingly, that the catholic Christian, no matter what his life be,
has Christ as his foundation, while this foundation is not possessed by
any heresy which is separated from the unity of His body.  And
therefore, through virtue of this foundation, even though the catholic
Christian by the inconsistency of his life has been as one building up
wood, hay, stubble, upon it, they believe that he shall be saved by
fire, in other words, that he shall be delivered after tasting the pain
of that fire to which the wicked shall be condemned at the last
judgment.
