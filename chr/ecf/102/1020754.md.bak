Muses.</span>

<span id="v.v.xvii-p2"></span>27.  For we must not listen to the
falsities of heathen superstition, which represent the nine Muses as
daughters of Jupiter and Mercury.  Varro refutes these, and I doubt
whether any one can be found among them more curious or more learned in
such matters.  He says that a certain state (I don’t recollect the name)
ordered from each of three artists a set of statues of the Muses, to be
placed as an offering in the temple of Apollo, intending that whichever
of the artists produced the most beautiful statues, they should select
and purchase from him.  It so happened that these artists executed their
works with equal beauty, that all nine pleased the state, and that all
were bought to be dedicated in the temple of Apollo; and he says that
afterwards Hesiod the poet gave names to them all.  It was not Jupiter,
therefore, that begat the nine Muses, but three artists created three
each.  And the state had originally given the order for three, not
because it had seen them in visions, nor because they had presented
themselves in that number to the eyes of any of the citizens, but
because it was obvious to remark that all sound, which is the material
of song, is by nature of three kinds.  For it is either produced by the
voice, as in the case of those who sing with the mouth without an
instrument; or by blowing, as in the case of trumpets and flutes; or by
striking, as in the case of harps and drums, and all other instruments
that give their sound when struck.
