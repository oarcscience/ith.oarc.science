id="v.vi.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 9.—Who is in Bondage to Signs, and Who
Not.</span>

<span id="v.vi.ix-p2"></span>13.  Now he is in bondage to a sign who
uses, or pays homage to, any significant object without knowing what it
signifies:  he, on the other hand, who either uses or honors a useful
sign divinely appointed, whose force and significance he understands,
does not honor the sign which is seen and temporal, but that to which
all such signs refer.  Now such a man is spiritual and free even at the
time of his bondage, when it is not yet expedient to reveal to carnal
minds those signs by subjection to which their carnality is to be
overcome.  To this class of spiritual persons belonged the patriarchs
and the prophets, and all those among the people of Israel through whose
instrumentality the Holy Spirit ministered unto us the aids and
consolations of the Scriptures.  But at the present time, after that the
proof of our liberty has shone forth so clearly in the resurrection of
our Lord, we are not oppressed with the heavy burden of attending even
to those signs which we now understand, but our Lord Himself, and
apostolic practice, have handed down to us a few rites in place of many,
and these at once very easy to perform, most majestic in their
significance, and most sacred in the observance; such, for example, as
the sacrament of baptism, and the celebration of the body and blood of
the Lord.  And as soon as any one looks upon these observances he knows
to what they refer, and so reveres them not in carnal bondage, but in
spiritual freedom.  Now, as to follow the letter, and to take signs for
the things that are signified by them, is a mark of weakness and
bondage; so to interpret signs wrongly is the result of being misled by
error.  He, however, who does not understand what a sign signifies, but
yet knows that it is a sign, is not in bondage.  And it is better even
to be in bondage to unknown but useful signs than, by interpreting them
wrongly, to draw the neck from under the yoke of bondage only to insert
it in the coils of error.
