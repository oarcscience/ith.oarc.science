id="iv.XVIII.19-p1.1"></span>Chapter 19.—That Æneas Came into Italy When
Abdon the Judge Ruled Over the Hebrews.</span>

<span id="iv.XVIII.19-p2"></span>After the capture and destruction of
Troy, Æneas, with twenty ships laden with the Trojan relics, came into
Italy, when Latinus reigned there, Menestheus in Athens, Polyphidos in
Sicyon, and Tautanos in Assyria, and Abdon was judge of the Hebrews.  On
the death of Latinus, Æneas reigned three years, the same kings
continuing in the above-named places, except that Pelasgus was now king
in Sicyon, and Samson was judge of the Hebrews, who is thought to be
Hercules, because of his wonderful strength.  Now the Latins made Æneas
one of their gods, because at his death he was nowhere to be found.  The
Sabines also placed among the gods their first king, Sancus, \[Sangus\],
or Sanctus, as some call him.  At that time Codrus king of Athens
exposed himself *incognito* to be slain by the Peloponnesian foes of
that city, and so was slain.  In this way, they say, he delivered his
country.  For the Peloponnesians had received a response from the
oracle, that they should overcome the Athenians only on condition that
they did not slay their king.  Therefore he deceived them by appearing
in a poor man’s dress, and provoking them, by quarrelling, to murder
him.  Whence Virgil says, “Or the quarrels of Codrus.” <span

man as a god with sacrificial honors.  The fourth king of the Latins was
Silvius the son of Æneas, not by Creüsa, of whom Ascanius the third king
was born, but by Lavinia the daughter of Latinus, and he is said to have
been his posthumous child.  Oneus was the twenty-ninth king of Assyria,
Melanthus the sixteenth of the Athenians, and Eli the priest was judge
of the Hebrews; and the kingdom of Sicyon then came to an end, after
lasting, it is said, for nine hundred and fifty-nine years.
