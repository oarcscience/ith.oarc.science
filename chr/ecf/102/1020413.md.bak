<span id="iv.XIV.21-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XIV.21-p1.1"></span>Chapter 21.—That Man’s Transgression Did Not
Annul the Blessing of Fecundity Pronounced Upon Man Before He Sinned But
Infected It with the Disease of Lust.</span>

<span id="iv.XIV.21-p2"></span>Far be it, then, from us to suppose that
our first parents in Paradise felt that lust which caused them
afterwards to blush and hide their nakedness, or that by its means they
should have fulfilled the benediction of God, “Increase and multiply and
replenish the earth;” <span id="fr_749"></span>[750](#fn_749.md) for it was
after sin that lust began.  It was after sin that our nature, having
lost the power it had over the whole body, but not having lost all
shame, perceived, noticed, blushed at, and covered it.  But that
blessing upon marriage, which encouraged them to increase and multiply
and replenish the earth, though it continued even after they had sinned,
was yet given before they sinned, in order that the procreation of
children might be recognized as part of the glory of marriage, and not
of the punishment of sin.  But now, men being ignorant of the
blessedness of Paradise, suppose that children could not have been
begotten there in any other way than they know them to be begotten now,
*i.e*., by lust, at which even honorable marriage blushes; some not
simply rejecting, but sceptically deriding the divine Scriptures, in
which we read that our first parents, after they sinned, were ashamed of
their nakedness, and covered it; while others, though they accept and
honor Scripture, yet conceive that this expression, “Increase and
multiply,” refers not to carnal fecundity, because a similar expression
is used of the soul in the words, “Thou wilt multiply me with strength
in my soul;” <span id="fr_750"></span>[751](#fn_750.md) and so, too, in the
words which follow in Genesis, “And replenish the earth, and subdue it,”
they understand by the earth the body which the soul fills with its
presence, and which it rules over when it is multiplied in strength. 
And they hold that children could no more then than now be begotten
without lust, which, after sin, was kindled, observed, blushed for, and
covered; and even that children would not have been born in Paradise,
but only outside of it, as in fact it turned out.  For it was after they
were expelled from it that they came together to beget children, and
begot them.
