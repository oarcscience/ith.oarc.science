<span id="iv.XXII.23-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XXII.23-p1.1"></span>Chapter 23.—Of the Miseries of This Life
Which Attach Peculiarly to the Toil of Good Men, Irrespective of Those
Which are Common to the Good and Bad.</span>

<span id="iv.XXII.23-p2"></span>But, irrespective of the miseries which
in this life are common to the good and bad, the righteous undergo
labors peculiar to themselves, in so far as they make war upon their
vices, and are involved in the temptations and perils of such a
contest.  For though sometimes more violent and at other times slacker,
yet without intermission does the flesh lust against the spirit and the
spirit against the flesh, so that we cannot do the things we
would, <span id="fr_1653"></span>[1654](#fn_1653.md) and extirpate all
lust, but can only refuse consent to it, as God gives us ability, and so
keep it under, vigilantly keeping watch lest a semblance of truth
deceive us, lest a subtle discourse blind us, lest error involve us in
darkness, lest we should take good for evil or evil for good, lest fear
should hinder us from doing what we ought, or desire precipitate us into
doing what we ought not, lest the sun go down upon our wrath, lest
hatred provoke us to render evil for evil, lest unseemly or immoderate
grief consume us, lest an ungrateful disposition make us slow to
recognize benefits received, lest calumnies fret our conscience, lest
rash suspicion on our part deceive us regarding a friend, or false
suspicion of us on the part of others give us too much uneasiness, lest
sin reign in our mortal body to obey its desires, lest our members be
used as the instruments of unrighteousness, lest the eye follow lust,
lest thirst for revenge carry us away, lest sight or thought dwell too
long on some evil thing which gives us pleasure, lest wicked or indecent
language be willingly listened to, lest we do what is pleasant but
unlawful, and lest in this warfare, filled so abundantly with toil and
peril, we either hope to secure victory by our own strength, or
attribute it when secured to our own strength, and not to His grace of
whom the apostle says, “Thanks be unto God, who giveth us the victory
through our Lord Jesus Christ;” <span
id="fr_1654"></span>[1655](#fn_1654.md) and in another place he says, “In
all these things we are more than conquerors through Him that loved
us.” <span id="fr_1655"></span>[1656](#fn_1655.md)   But yet we are to know
this, that however valorously we resist our vices, and however
successful we are in overcoming them, yet as long as we are in this body
we have always reason to say to God, Forgive us our debts.” <span
id="fr_1656"></span>[1657](#fn_1656.md)   But in that kingdom where we
shall dwell for ever, clothed in immortal bodies, we shall no longer
have either conflicts or debts,—as indeed we should not have had at any
time or in any condition, had our nature continued upright as it was
created.  Consequently even this our conflict, in which we are exposed
to peril, and from which we hope to be delivered by a final victory,
belongs to the ills of this life, which is proved by the witness of so
many grave evils to be a life under condemnation.
