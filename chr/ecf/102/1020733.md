id="v.iv.xxxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 37.—Dangers of Mistaken
Interpretation.</span>

<span id="v.iv.xxxvii-p2"></span>For if he takes up rashly a meaning
which the author whom he is reading did not intend, he often falls in
with other statements which he cannot harmonize with this meaning.  And
if he admits that these statements are true and certain, then it follows
that the meaning he had put upon the former passage cannot be the true
one:  and so it comes to pass, one can hardly tell how, that, out of
love for his own opinion, he begins to feel more angry with Scripture
than he is with himself.  And if he should once permit that evil to
creep in, it will utterly destroy him.  “For we walk by faith, not by
sight.” <span id="fr_1753"></span>[1754](#fn_1753)   Now faith will
totter if the authority of Scripture begin to shake.  And then, if faith
totter, love itself will grow cold.  For if a man has fallen from faith,
he must necessarily also fall from love; for he cannot love what he does
not believe to exist.  But if he both believes and loves, then through
good works, and through diligent attention to the precepts of morality,
he comes to hope also that he shall attain the object of his love.  And
so these are the three things to which all knowledge and all prophecy
are subservient:  faith, hope, love.
