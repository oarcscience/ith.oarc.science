<span id="iv.XI.13-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XI.13-p1.1"></span>Chapter 13.—Whether All the Angels Were So
Created in One Common State of Felicity, that Those Who Fell Were Not
Aware that They Would Fall, and that Those Who Stood Received Assurance
of Their Own Perseverance After the Ruin of the Fallen.</span>

<span id="iv.XI.13-p2"></span>From all this, it will readily occur to
any one that the blessedness which an intelligent being desires as its
legitimate object results from a combination of these two things,
namely, that it uninterruptedly enjoy the unchangeable good, which is
God; and that it be delivered from all dubiety, and know certainly that
it shall eternally abide in the same enjoyment.  That it is so with the
angels of light we piously believe; but that the fallen angels, who by
their own default lost that light, did not enjoy this blessedness even
before they sinned, reason bids us conclude.  Yet if their life was of
any duration before they fell, we must allow them a blessedness of some
kind, though not that which is accompanied with foresight.  Or, if it
seems hard to believe that, when the angels were created, some were
created in ignorance either of their perseverance or their fall, while
others were most certainly assured of the eternity of their felicity,—if
it is hard to believe that they were not all from the beginning on an
equal footing, until these who are now evil did of their own will fall
away from the light of goodness, certainly it is much harder to believe
that the holy angels are now uncertain of their eternal blessedness, and
do not know regarding themselves as much as we have been able to gather
regarding them from the Holy Scriptures.  For what catholic Christian
does not know that no new devil will ever arise among the good angels,
as he knows that this present devil will never again return <span
id="page_213">p. 213</span> <span id="iv.XI.13-Page_213"></span> into
the fellowship of the good?  For the truth in the gospel promises to the
saints and the faithful that they will be equal to the angels of God;
and it is also promised them that they will “go away into life
eternal.” <span id="fr_473"></span>[474](#fn_473.md)   But if we are
certain that we shall never lapse from eternal felicity, while they are
not certain, then we shall not be their equals, but their superiors. 
But as the truth never deceives, and as we shall be their equals, they
must be certain of their blessedness.  And because the evil angels could
not be certain of that, since their blessedness was destined to come to
an end, it follows either that the angels were unequal, or that, if
equal, the good angels were assured of the eternity of their blessedness
after the perdition of the others; unless, possibly, some one may say
that the words of the Lord about the devil “He was a murderer from the
beginning, and abode not in the truth,” <span
id="fr_474"></span>[475](#fn_474.md) are to be understood as if he was not
only a murderer from the beginning of the human race, when man, whom he
could kill by his deceit, was made, but also that he did not abide in
the truth from the time of his own creation, and was accordingly never
blessed with the holy angels, but refused to submit to his Creator, and
proudly exulted as if in a private lordship of his own, and was thus
deceived and deceiving.  For the dominion of the Almighty cannot be
eluded; and he who will not piously submit himself to things as they
are, proudly feigns, and mocks himself with a state of things that does
not exist; so that what the blessed Apostle John says thus becomes
intelligible:  “The devil sinneth from the beginning,” <span
id="fr_475"></span>[476](#fn_475.md) —that is, from the time he was created
he refused righteousness, which none but a will piously subject to God
can enjoy.  Whoever adopts this opinion at least disagrees with those
heretics the Manichees, and with any other pestilential sect that may
suppose that the devil has derived from some adverse evil principle a
nature proper to himself.  These persons are so befooled by error, that,
although they acknowledge with ourselves the authority of the gospels,
they do not notice that the Lord did not say, “The devil was naturally a
stranger to the truth,” but “The devil abode not in the truth,” by which
He meant us to understand that he had fallen from the truth, in which,
if he had abode, he would have become a partaker of it, and have
remained in blessedness along with the holy angels. <span
