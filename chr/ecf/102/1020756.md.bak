Knowledge.</span>

<span id="v.v.xix-p2"></span>29.  But to explain more fully this whole
topic (for it is one that cannot be omitted), there are two kinds of
knowledge which are in vogue among the heathen.  One is the knowledge of
things instituted by men, the other of things which they have noted,
either as transacted in the past or as instituted by God.  The former
kind, that which deals with human institutions, is partly superstitious,
partly not.
