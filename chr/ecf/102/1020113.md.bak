<span id="iv.IV.8-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.IV.8-p1.1"></span>Chapter 8.—Which of the Gods Can the Romans
Suppose Presided Over the Increase and Preservation of Their Empire,
When They Have Believed that Even the Care of Single Things Could
Scarcely Be Committed to Single Gods.</span>

<span id="iv.IV.8-p2"></span>Next let us ask, if they please, out of so
great a crowd of gods which the Romans worship, whom in especial, or
what gods they believe to have extended and preserved that empire.  Now,
surely of this work, which is so excellent and so very full of the
highest dignity, they dare not ascribe any part to the goddess
Cloacina; <span id="fr_165"></span>[166](#fn_165.md) or to Volupia, who has
her appellation from voluptuousness; or to Libentina, who has her name
from lust; or to Vaticanus, who presides over the screaming of infants;
or to Cunina, who rules over their cradles.  But how is it possible to
recount in one part of this book all the names of gods or goddesses,
which they could scarcely comprise in great volumes, distributing among
these divinities their peculiar offices about single things?  They have
not even thought that the charge of their lands should be committed to
any one god: but they have entrusted their farms to Rusina; the ridges
of the mountains to Jugatinus; over the downs they have set the goddess
Collatina; over the valleys, Vallonia.  Nor could they even find one
Segetia so competent, that they could commend to her care all their corn
crops at once; but so long as their seed-corn was still under the
ground, they would have the goddess Seia set over it; then, whenever it
was above ground and formed straw, they set over it the goddess Segetia;
and when the grain was collected and stored, they set over it the
goddess Tutilina, that it might be kept safe.  Who would not have
thought that goddess Segetia sufficient to take care of the standing
corn until it had passed from the first green blades to the dry ears? 
Yet she was not enough for men, who loved a multitude of gods, that the
miserable soul, despising the chaste embrace of the one true God, should
be prostituted to a crowd of demons.  Therefore they set Proserpina over
the germinating seeds; over the joints and knots of the stems, the god
Nodotus; over the sheaths enfolding the ears, the goddess Voluntina;
when the sheaths opened that the spike might shoot forth, it was
ascribed to the goddess Patelana; when the stems stood all equal with
new ears, because the ancients described this equalizing by the term
*hostire*, it was ascribed to the goddess Hostilina; when the grain was
in flower, it was dedicated to the goddess Flora; when full of milk, to
the god Lacturnus; when maturing, to the goddess Matuta; when the crop
was runcated,—that is, removed from the soil,—to the goddess Runcina. 
Nor do I yet recount them all, for I am sick of all this, though it
gives them no shame.  Only, I have said these very few things, in order
that it may be understood they dare by no means say that the Roman
empire has been established, increased, and preserved by their deities,
who had all their own functions assigned to them in such a way, that no
general oversight was entrusted to any one of them.  When, therefore,
could Segetia take care of the empire, who was not allowed to take care
of the corn and the trees?  When could Cunina take thought about war,
whose oversight was not allowed to go beyond the cradles of the babies? 
When could Nodotus give help in battle, who had nothing to do even with
the sheath of the ear, but only with the knots of the joints?  Every one
sets a porter at the <span id="page_69">p. 69</span> <span
id="iv.IV.8-Page_69"></span> door of his house, and because he is a man,
he is quite sufficient; but these people have set three gods, Forculus
to the doors, Cardea to the hinge, Limentinus to the threshold. <span
id="fr_166"></span>[167](#fn_166.md)   Thus Forculus could not at the same
time take care also of the hinge and the threshold.

<span id="iv.IV.8-p3"></span> Cloacina, supposed by Lactantius (*De
falsa relig.* i. 20), Cyprian (*De Idol. vanit.*), and Augustin
(*infra*, c. 23) to be the goddess of the *cloaca*, or sewage of Rome. 
Others, however, suppose it to be equivalent to Cluacina, a title given
to Venus, because the Romans after the end of the Sabine war purified
themselves (*cluere*) in the vicinity of her statue.
