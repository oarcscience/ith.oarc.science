<span id="iv.XX.5-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XX.5-p1.1"></span>Chapter 5.—The Passages in Which the Saviour
Declares that There Shall Be a Divine Judgment in the End of the
World.</span>

<span id="iv.XX.5-p2"></span>The Saviour Himself, while reproving the
cities in which He had done great works, but which had not believed, and
while setting them in unfavorable comparison with foreign cities, says,
“But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at
the day of judgment than for you.” <span
id="fr_1322"></span>[1323](#fn_1322.md)   And a little after He says,
“Verily, I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of
Sodom in the day of judgment than for thee.” <span
id="fr_1323"></span>[1324](#fn_1323.md)   Here He most plainly predicts
that a day of judgment is to come.  And in another place He says, “The
men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall
condemn it:  because they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and,
behold, a greater than Jonas is here.  The queen of the south shall rise
up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it:  for she
came from the utter <span id="page_424">p. 424</span> <span
id="iv.XX.5-Page_424"></span> most parts of the earth to hear the words
of Solomon; and behold, a greater than Solomon is here.” <span
id="fr_1324"></span>[1325](#fn_1324.md)   Two things we learn from this
passage, that a judgment is to take place, and that it is to take place
at the resurrection of the dead.  For when He spoke of the Ninevites and
the queen of the south, He certainly spoke of dead persons, and yet He
said that they should rise up in the day of judgment.  He did not say,
“They shall condemn,” as if they themselves were to be the judges, but
because, in comparison with them, the others shall be justly condemned.

<span id="iv.XX.5-p6"></span>Again, in another passage, in which He was
speaking of the present intermingling and future separation of the good
and bad,—the separation which shall be made in the day of judgment,—He
adduced a comparison drawn from the sown wheat and the tares sown among
them, and gave this explanation of it to His disciples:  “He that soweth
the good seed is the Son of man,” <span
id="fr_1325"></span>[1326](#fn_1325.md) etc.  Here, indeed, He did not name
the judgment or the day of judgment, but indicated it much more clearly
by describing the circumstances, and foretold that it should take place
in the end of the world.

<span id="iv.XX.5-p8"></span>In like manner He says to His disciples,
“Verily I say unto you, That ye which have followed me, in the
regeneration, when the Son of man shall sit on the throne of His glory,
ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of
Israel.” <span id="fr_1326"></span>[1327](#fn_1326.md)   Here we learn that
Jesus shall judge with His disciples.  And therefore He said elsewhere
to the Jews, “If I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your sons
cast them out?  Therefore they shall be your judges.” <span
id="fr_1327"></span>[1328](#fn_1327.md)   Neither ought we to suppose that
only twelve men shall judge along with Him, though He says that they
shall sit upon twelve thrones; for by the number twelve is signified the
completeness of the multitude of those who shall judge.  For the two
parts of the number seven (which commonly symbolizes totality), that is
to say four and three, multiplied into one another, give twelve.  For
four times three, or three times four, are twelve.  There are other
meanings, too, in this number twelve.  Were not this the right
interpretation of the twelve thrones, then since we read that Matthias
was ordained an apostle in the room of Judas the traitor, the Apostle
Paul, though he labored more than them all, <span
id="fr_1328"></span>[1329](#fn_1328.md) should have no throne of judgment;
but he unmistakeably considers himself to be included in the number of
the judges when he says, “Know ye not that we shall judge angels?” <span
id="fr_1329"></span>[1330](#fn_1329.md)   The same rule is to be observed
in applying the number twelve to those who are to be judged.  For though
it was said, “judging the twelve tribes of Israel,” the tribe of Levi,
which is the thirteenth, shall not on this account be exempt from
judgment, neither shall judgment be passed only on Israel and not on the
other nations.  And by the words “in the regeneration,” He certainly
meant the resurrection of the dead to be understood; for our flesh shall
be regenerated by incorruption, as our soul is regenerated by faith.

<span id="iv.XX.5-p13"></span>Many passages I omit, because, though they
seem to refer to the last judgment, yet on a closer examination they are
found to be ambiguous, or to allude rather to some other event,—whether
to that coming of the Saviour which continually occurs in His Church,
that is, in His members, in which comes little by little, and piece by
piece, since the whole Church is His body, or to the destruction of the
earthly Jerusalem.  For when He speaks even of this, He often uses
language which is applicable to the end of the world and that last and
great day of judgment, so that these two events cannot be distinguished
unless all the corresponding passages bearing on the subject in the
three evangelists, Matthew, Mark, and Luke, are compared with one
another,—for some things are put more obscurely by one evangelist and
more plainly by another,—so that it becomes apparent what things are
meant to be referred to one event.  It is this which I have been at
pains to do in a letter which I wrote to Hesychius of blessed memory,
bishop of Salon, and entitled, “Of the End of the World.” <span
id="fr_1330"></span>[1331](#fn_1330.md)

<span id="iv.XX.5-p15"></span>I shall now cite from the Gospel according
to Matthew the passage which speaks of the separation of the good from
the wicked by the most efficacious and final judgment of Christ:  “When
the Son of man,” he says, “shall come in His glory, . . . then shall He
say also unto them on His left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into
everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels.” <span
id="fr_1331"></span>[1332](#fn_1331.md)   Then He in like manner recounts
to the wicked the things they had not done, but which He had said those
on the right hand had done.  And when they ask when they had seen Him in
need of these things, He replies that, inasmuch as they had not done it
to the least of His brethren, they had not done it unto Him, and
concludes His address in the words, “And these shall go away into
everlasting punishment, but the righteous into <span id="page_425">p.
425</span> <span id="iv.XX.5-Page_425"></span> life eternal.”  Moreover,
the evangelist John most distinctly states that He had predicted that
the judgment should be at the resurrection of the dead.  For after
saying, “The Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto
the Son:  that all men should honor the Son, even as they honor the
Father:  he that honoreth not the Son, honoreth not the Father which
hath sent Him;” He immediately adds, “Verily, verily, I say unto you, He
that heareth my word and believeth on Him that sent me, hath everlasting
life, and shall not come into judgment; but is passed from death to
life.” <span id="fr_1332"></span>[1333](#fn_1332.md)   Here He said that
believers on Him should not come into judgment.  How, then, shall they
be separated from the wicked by judgment, and be set at His right hand,
unless judgment be in this passage used for condemnation?  For into
judgment, in this sense, they shall not come who hear His word, and
believe on Him that sent Him.
