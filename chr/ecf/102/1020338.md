<span id="iv.XI.34-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XI.34-p1.1"></span>Chapter 34.—Of the Idea that the Angels Were
Meant Where the Separation of the Waters by the Firmament is Spoken Of,
and of that Other Idea that the Waters Were Not Created.</span>

<span id="iv.XI.34-p2"></span>Some, <span
id="fr_520"></span>[521](#fn_520) however, have supposed that the
angelic hosts are somehow referred to under the name of waters, and that
this is what is meant by “Let there be a firmament in the midst of the
waters:” <span id="fr_521"></span>[522](#fn_521)   that the waters above
should be understood of the angels, and those below either of the
visible waters, or of the multitude of bad angels, or of the nations of
men.  If this be so, then it does not here appear when the angels were
created, but when they were separated.  Though there have not been
wanting men foolish and wicked enough <span
id="fr_522"></span>[523](#fn_522) to deny that the waters were made by
God, because it is nowhere written, “God said, Let there be waters.” 
With equal folly they might say the same of the earth, for nowhere do we
read, “God said, Let the earth be.”  But, say they, it is written, “In
the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.”  Yes, and there the
water is meant, for both are included in one word.  For “the sea is
His,” as the psalm says, “and He made it; and His hands formed the dry
land.” <span id="fr_523"></span>[524](#fn_523)   But those who would
understand the angels by the waters above the skies have a difficulty
about the specific gravity of the elements, and fear that the waters,
owing to their fluidity and weight, could not be set in the upper parts
of the world.  So that, if they were to construct a man upon their own
principles, they would not put in his head any moist humors, or “phlegm”
as the Greeks call it, and which acts the part of water among the
elements of our body.  But, in God’s handiwork, the head is the seat of
the phlegm, and surely most fitly; and yet, according to their
supposition, so absurdly that if we were not aware of the fact, and were
informed by this same record that God had put a moist and cold and
therefore heavy humor in the uppermost part of man’s body, these
world-weighers would refuse belief.  And if they were confronted with
the authority of Scripture, they would maintain that something else must
be meant by the words.  But, were we to investigate and discover all the
details which are written in this divine book regarding the creation of
the world, we should have much to say, and should widely digress from
the proposed aim of this work.  Since, then, we have now said what
seemed needful regarding these two diverse and contrary communities of
angels, in which the origin of the two human communities (of which we
intend to speak anon) is also found, let us at once bring this book also
to a conclusion.

<span id="iv.XI.34-p3"></span> Augustin himself published this idea in
his *Conf*. xiii. 32 but afterwards retracted it, as “said without
sufficient consideration” (*Retract*. II. vi. 2).  Epiphanius and Jerome
ascribe it to Origen.
