id="iv.VIII.9-p1.1"></span>Chapter 9.—Concerning that Philosophy Which
Has Come Nearest to the Christian Faith.</span>

<span id="iv.VIII.9-p2"></span>Whatever philosophers, therefore, thought
concerning the supreme God, that He is both the maker of all created
things, the light by which things are known, and the good in reference
to which things are to be done; that we have in Him the first principle
of nature, the truth of doctrine, and the happiness of life,—whether
these philosophers may be more suitably called Platonists, or whether
they may give some other name to their sect; whether, we say, that only
the chief men of the Ionic school, such as Plato himself, and they who
have well understood him, have thought thus; or whether we also include
the Italic school, on account of Pythagoras and the Pythagoreans, and
all who may have held like opinions; and, lastly, whether also we
include all who have been held wise men and philosophers among all
nations who are discovered to have seen and taught this, be they
Atlantics, Libyans, Egyptians, Indians, Persians, Chaldeans, Scythians,
Gauls, Spaniards, or of other nations,—we prefer these to all other
philosophers, and confess that they approach nearest to us.
