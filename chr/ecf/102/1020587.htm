<p class="c34"><a name="iv.XIX.14-p1"></A><span class="c2"><a name="iv.XIX.14-p1.1"></A>Chapter 14.&#8212;Of the Order and Law Which Obtain in Heaven and Earth, Whereby It Comes to Pass that Human Society Is Served by Those Who Rule It.</span></p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="iv.XIX.14-p2"></A>The whole use, then, of things temporal has a reference to this result of earthly peace in the earthly community, while in the city of God it is connected with eternal peace.&#160; And therefore, if we were irrational animals, we should desire nothing beyond the proper arrangement of the parts of the body and the satisfaction of the appetites,&#8212;nothing, therefore, but bodily comfort and abundance of pleasures, that the peace of the body might contribute to the peace of the soul.&#160; For if bodily peace be awanting, a bar is put to the peace even of the irrational soul, since it cannot obtain the gratification of its appetites.&#160; And these two together help out the mutual peace of soul and body, the peace of harmonious life and health.&#160; For as animals, by shunning pain, show that they love bodily peace, and, by pursuing pleasure to gratify their appetites, show that they love peace of soul, so their shrinking from death is a sufficient indication of their intense love of that peace which binds soul and body in close alliance.&#160; But, as man has a rational soul, he subordinates all this which he has in common with the beasts to the peace of his rational soul, that his intellect may have free play and may regulate his actions, and that he may thus enjoy the well-ordered harmony of knowledge and action which constitutes, as we have said, the peace of the rational soul.&#160; And for this purpose he must desire to be neither molested by pain, nor disturbed by desire, nor extinguished by death, that he may arrive at some useful knowledge by which he may regulate his life and manners.&#160; But, owing to the liability of the human mind to fall into mistakes, this very pursuit of knowledge may be a snare to him unless he has a divine Master, whom he may obey without misgiving, and who may at the same time give him such help as to preserve his own freedom.&#160; And because, so long as he is in this mortal body, he is a stranger to God, he walks by faith, not by sight; and he therefore refers all peace, bodily or spiritual or both, to that peace which mortal man has with the immortal God, so that he exhibits the well-ordered obedience of faith to eternal law.&#160; But as this divine Master inculcates two precepts,&#8212;the love of God and the love of our neighbor,&#8212;and as in these precepts a man finds three things he has to love,&#8212;God, himself, and his neighbor,&#8212;and that he who loves God loves himself thereby, it follows that he must endeavor to get his neighbor to love God, since he is ordered to love his neighbor as himself.&#160; He ought to make this endeavor in behalf of his wife, his children, his household, all within his reach, even as he would wish his neighbor to do the same for him if he needed it; and consequently he will be at peace, or in well-ordered concord, with all men, as far as in him lies.&#160; And this is the order of this concord, that a man, in the first place, injure no one, and, in the second, do good to every one he can reach.&#160; Primarily, therefore, his own household are his care, for the law of nature and of society gives him readier access to them and greater opportunity of serving them.&#160; And hence the apostle says, &#8220;Now, if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1282"></A><A HREF="#fn_1282"><FONT SIZE="1">1283</FONT></A>
&#160; This is the origin of domestic peace,  <A NAME="page_411"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 411</FONT></A> <a name="iv.XIX.14-Page_411"></A>  or the well-ordered concord of those in the family who rule and those who obey.&#160; For they who care for the rest rule,&#8212;the husband the wife, the parents the children, the masters the servants; and they who are cared for obey,&#8212;the women their husbands, the children their parents, the servants their masters.&#160; But in the family of the just man who lives by faith and is as yet a pilgrim journeying on to the celestial city, even those who rule serve those whom they seem to command; for they rule not from a love of power, but from a sense of the duty they owe to others&#8212;not because they are proud of authority, but because they love mercy.</p>
