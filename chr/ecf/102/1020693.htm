<p class="c21"><a name="v.i-p2"></A><span class="c11"><a name="v.i-p2.1"></A>The</span> four books of St. Augustin <i>On Christian Doctrine (De Doctrina Christiana, iv libri)</i> are a compend of exegetical theology to guide the reader in the understanding and interpretation of the Sacred Scriptures, according to the analogy of faith.&#160; The first three books were written <span class="c20"><a name="v.i-p2.2"></A>a.d.</span> 397; the fourth was added 426.</p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="v.i-p3"></A>He speaks of it in his <i> Retractations</i>, Bk. <i>ii</i>., chap. 4, as follows:</p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="v.i-p4"></A>&#8220;Finding that the books on Christian Doctrine were not finished, I thought it better to complete them before passing on to the revision of others.&#160; Accordingly, I completed the third book, which had been written as far as the place where a quotation is made from the Gospel about the woman who took leaven and hid it in three measures of meal till the whole was leavened.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1701"></A><A HREF="#fn_1701"><FONT SIZE="1">1702</FONT></A>
&#160; I added also the last book, and finished the whole work in four books [in the year 426]:&#160; the first three affording aids to the interpretation of Scripture, the last giving directions as to the mode of making known our interpretation.&#160; In the second book,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1702"></A><A HREF="#fn_1702"><FONT SIZE="1">1703</FONT></A>
 I made a mistake as to the authorship of the book commonly called the Wisdom of Solomon.&#160; For I have since learnt that it is not a well-established fact, as I said it was, that Jesus the son of Sirach, who wrote the book of Ecclesiasticus, wrote this book also:&#160; on the contrary, I have ascertained that it is altogether more probable that he was not the author of this book.&#160; Again, when I said, &#145;The authority of the Old Testament is contained within the limits of these forty-four books,&#146;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1703"></A><A HREF="#fn_1703"><FONT SIZE="1">1704</FONT></A>
 I used the phrase &#145;Old Testament&#146; in accordance with ecclesiastical usage.&#160; But the apostle seems to restrict the application of the name &#145;Old Testament&#146; to the law which was given on Mount Sinai.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1704"></A><A HREF="#fn_1704"><FONT SIZE="1">1705</FONT></A>
&#160; And in what I said as to St. Ambrose having, by his knowledge of chronology, solved a great difficulty, when he showed that Plato and Jeremiah were contemporaries,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1705"></A><A HREF="#fn_1705"><FONT SIZE="1">1706</FONT></A>
 my memory betrayed me.&#160; What that great bishop really did say upon this subject may be seen in the book which he wrote, &#145;On Sacraments or Philosophy.&#146;&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1706"></A><A HREF="#fn_1706"><FONT SIZE="1">1707</FONT></A>
