id="iv.VIII.25-p1.2"></span> 25.—Concerning Those Things Which May Be
Common to the Holy Angels and to Men.</span>

<span id="iv.VIII.25-p2"></span>Wherefore we must by no means seek,
through the supposed mediation of demons, to avail ourselves of the
benevolence or beneficence of the gods, or rather of the good angels,
but through resembling them in the possession of a good will, through
which we are with them, and live with them, and worship with them the
same God, although we cannot see them with the eyes of our flesh.  But
it is not in locality we are distant from them, but in merit of life,
caused by our miserable unlikeness to them in will, and by the weakness
of our character; for the mere fact of our dwelling on earth under the
conditions of life in the flesh does not prevent our fellowship with
them.  It is only prevented when we, in the impurity of our hearts, mind
earthly things.  But in this present time, while we are being healed
that we may eventually be as they are, we are brought near to them by
faith, if by their assistance we believe that He who is their
blessedness is also ours.
