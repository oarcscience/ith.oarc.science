<span id="iv.XIII.10-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XIII.10-p1.1"></span>Chapter 10.—Of the Life of Mortals, Which is
Rather to Be Called Death Than Life.</span>

<span id="iv.XIII.10-p2"></span>For no sooner do we begin to live in
this dying body, than we begin to move ceaselessly towards death. <span
id="fr_589"></span>[590](#fn_589.md)   For in the whole course of this life
(if life we must call it) its mutability tends towards death.  Certainly
there is no one who is not nearer it this year than last year, and
to-morrow than to-day, and to-day than yesterday, and a short while
hence than now, and now than a short while ago.  For whatever time we
live is deducted from our whole term of life, and that which remains is
daily becoming less and less; so that our whole life is nothing but a
race towards death, in which no one is allowed to stand still for a
little space, or to go somewhat more slowly, but all are driven forwards
with an impartial movement, and with equal rapidity.  For he whose life
is short spends a day no more swiftly than he whose life is longer.  But
while the equal moments are impartially snatched from both, the one has
a nearer and the other a more remote goal to reach with this their equal
speed.  It is one thing to make a longer journey, and another to walk
more slowly.  He, therefore, who spends longer time on his way to death
does not proceed at a more leisurely pace, but goes over more ground. 
Further, if every man begins to die, that is, is in death, as soon as
death has begun to show itself in him (by taking away life, to wit; for
when life is all taken away, the man will be then not in death, but
after death), then he begins to die so soon as he begins to live.  For
what else is going on in all his days, hours, and moments, until this
slow-working death is fully consummated?  And then comes the time *after
death*, instead of that in which life was being withdrawn, and which we
called being *in death*.  Man, then, is never in life from the moment he
dwells in this dying rather than living body,—if, at least, he cannot be
in life and death at once.  Or rather, shall we say, he is in both?—in
life, namely, which he lives till all is consumed; but in death also,
which he dies as his life is consumed?  For if he is not in life, what
is it which is consumed till all be gone?  And if he is not in death,
what is this consumption itself?  For when the whole of life has been
consumed, the expression “after death” would be meaningless, had that
consumption not been death.  And if, when it has all been consumed, a
man is not in death but after death, when is he in death unless when
life is being consumed away?

<span id="iv.XIII.10-p3"></span> Much of this paradoxical statement
about death is taken from Seneca.  See, among other places, his epistle
on the premeditation of future dangers, the passage beginning, *Quotidie
morimur, quotide enim demitur aliqua pars vitæ*.
