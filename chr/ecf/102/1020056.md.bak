<span id="iv.II_1.13-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.II_1.13-p1.1"></span>Chapter 13.—That the Romans Should Have
Understood that Gods Who Desired to Be Worshipped in Licentious
Entertainments Were Unworthy of Divine Honor.</span>

<span id="iv.II_1.13-p2"></span>But Scipio, were he alive, would
possibly reply:  “How could we attach a penalty to that which the gods
themselves have consecrated?  For the theatrical entertainments in which
such things are said, and acted, and performed, were introduced into
Roman society by the gods, who ordered that they should be dedicated and
exhibited in their honor.”  But was not this, then, the plainest proof
that they were no true gods, nor in any respect worthy of receiving
divine honours from the republic?  Suppose they had required that in
their honor the citizens of Rome should be held up to ridicule, every
Roman would have resented the hateful proposal.  How then, I would ask,
can they be esteemed worthy of worship, when they propose that their own
crimes be used as material for celebrating their praises?  Does not this
artifice expose them, and prove that they are detestable devils?  Thus
the Romans, though they were superstitious enough to serve as gods those
who made no secret of their desire to be worshipped in licentious plays,
yet had sufficient regard to their hereditary dignity and virtue, to
prompt them to refuse to players any such rewards as the Greeks accorded
them.  On this point we have this testimony of Scipio, recorded in
Cicero:  “They \[the Romans\] considered comedy and all theatrical
performances as disgraceful, and therefore not only debarred players
from offices and honors open to ordinary citizens, but also decreed that
their names should be branded by the censor, and erased from the roll of
their tribe.”  An excellent decree, and another testimony to the
sagacity of Rome; but I could wish their prudence had been more
thorough-going and consistent.  For when I hear that if any Roman
citizen chose the stage as his profession, he not only closed to himself
every laudable career, but even became an outcast from his own tribe, I
cannot but exclaim:  This is the true Roman spirit, this is worthy of a
state <span id="page_30">p. 30</span> <span
id="iv.II_1.13-Page_30"></span> jealous of its reputation.  But then
some one interrupts my rapture, by inquiring with what consistency
players are debarred from all honors, while plays are counted among the
honors due to the gods?  For a long while the virtue of Rome was
uncontaminated by theatrical exhibitions; <span
id="fr_103"></span>[104](#fn_103.md) and if they had been adopted for the
sake of gratifying the taste of the citizens, they would have been
introduced hand in hand with the relaxation of manners.  But the fact
is, that it was the gods who demanded that they should be exhibited to
gratify them.  With what justice, then, is the player excommunicated by
whom God is worshipped?  On what pretext can you at once adore him who
exacts, and brand him who acts these plays?  This, then, is the
controversy in which the Greeks and Romans are engaged.  The Greeks
think they justly honor players, because they worship the gods who
demand plays; the Romans, on the other hand, do not suffer an actor to
disgrace by his name his own plebeian tribe, far less the senatorial
order.  And the whole of this discussion may be summed up in the
following syllogism.  The Greeks give us the major premise:  If such
gods are to be worshipped, then certainly such men may be honored.  The
Romans add the minor:  But such men must by no means be honoured.  The
Christians draw the conclusion:  Therefore such gods must by no means be
worshipped.

<span id="iv.II_1.13-p3"></span> According to Livy (vii. 2), theatrical
exhibitions were introduced in the year 392 <span class="c20"><span
id="iv.II_1.13-p3.1"></span>a.u.c.</span>  Before that time, he says,
there had only been the games of the circus.  The Romans sent to Etruria
for players, who were called *histriones, hister* being the Tuscan word
for a player.  Other particulars are added by Livy.
