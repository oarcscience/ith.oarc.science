<span id="iv.XIV.28-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XIV.28-p1.1"></span>Chapter 28.—Of the Nature of the Two Cities,
the Earthly and the Heavenly.</span>

<span id="iv.XIV.28-p2"></span>Accordingly, two cities have been formed
by two loves: the earthly by the love of self, even to the contempt of
God; the heavenly by <span id="page_283">p. 283</span> <span
id="iv.XIV.28-Page_283"></span> the love of God, even to the contempt of
self.  The former, in a word, glories in itself, the latter in the
Lord.  For the one seeks glory from men; but the greatest glory of the
other is God, the witness of conscience.  The one lifts up its head in
its own glory; the other says to its God, “Thou art my glory, and the
lifter up of mine head.” <span id="fr_762"></span>[763](#fn_762.md)   In
the one, the princes and the nations it subdues are ruled by the love of
ruling; in the other, the princes and the subjects serve one another in
love, the latter obeying, while the former take thought for all.  The
one delights in its own strength, represented in the persons of its
rulers; the other says to its God, “I will love Thee, O Lord, my
strength.” <span id="fr_763"></span>[764](#fn_763.md)   And therefore the
wise men of the one city, living according to man, have sought for
profit to their own bodies or souls, or both, and those who have known
God “glorified Him not as God, neither were thankful, but became vain in
their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened; professing
themselves to be wise,”—that is, glorying in their own wisdom, and being
possessed by pride,—“they became fools, and changed the glory of the
incorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to
birds, and four-footed beasts, and creeping things.”  For they were
either leaders or followers of the people in adoring images, “and
worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed
for ever.” <span id="fr_764"></span>[765](#fn_764.md)   But in the other
city there is no human wisdom, but only godliness, which offers due
worship to the true God, and looks for its reward in the society of the
saints, of holy angels as well as holy men, “that God may be all in
all.” <span id="fr_765"></span>[766](#fn_765.md)
