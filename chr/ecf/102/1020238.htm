<p class="c34"><a name="iv.VIII.19-p1"></A><span class="c2"><a name="iv.VIII.19-p1.1"></A>Chapter 19.&#8212;Of the Impiety of the Magic Art, Which is Dependent on the Assistance of Malign Spirits.</span></p>  
<p class="c26"><a name="iv.VIII.19-p2"></A>Moreover, against those magic arts, concerning which some men, exceedingly wretched and exceedingly impious, delight to boast, may not public opinion itself be brought forward as a witness?&#160; For why are those arts so severely punished by the laws, if they are the works of deities who ought to be worshipped?&#160; Shall it be said that the Christians have or  <A NAME="page_157"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 157</FONT></A> <a name="iv.VIII.19-Page_157"></A>  dained those laws by which magic arts are punished?&#160; With what other meaning, except that these sorceries are without doubt pernicious to the human race, did the most illustrious poet say,</p>  
<p class="c27"><a name="iv.VIII.19-p3"></A>&#8220;By heaven, I swear, and your dear life,</p>  
<p class="c39"><a name="iv.VIII.19-p4"></A>Unwillingly these arms I wield,</p>  
<p class="c28"><a name="iv.VIII.19-p5"></A>And take, to meet the coming strife,</p>  
<p class="c40"><a name="iv.VIII.19-p6"></A>Enchantment&#146;s sword and shield.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_314"></A><A HREF="#fn_314"><FONT SIZE="1">315</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p class="c36"><a name="iv.VIII.19-p8"></A>And that also which he says in another place concerning magic arts,</p>  
<p class="c37"><a name="iv.VIII.19-p9"></A>&#8220;I&#146;ve seen him to another place transport the standing corn,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_315"></A><A HREF="#fn_315"><FONT SIZE="1">316</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p><a name="iv.VIII.19-p11"></A>has reference to the fact that the fruits of one field are said to be transferred to another by these arts which this pestiferous and accursed doctrine teaches.&#160; Does not Cicero inform us that, among the laws of the Twelve Tables, that is, the most ancient laws of the Romans, there was a law written which appointed a punishment to be inflicted on him who should do this?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_316"></A><A HREF="#fn_316"><FONT SIZE="1">317</FONT></A>
&#160; Lastly, was it before Christian judges that Apuleius himself was accused of magic arts?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_317"></A><A HREF="#fn_317"><FONT SIZE="1">318</FONT></A>
&#160; Had he known these arts to be divine and pious, and congruous with the works of divine power, he ought not only to have confessed, but also to have professed them, rather blaming the laws by which these things were prohibited and pronounced worthy of condemnation, while they ought to have been held worthy of admiration and respect.&#160; For by so doing, either he would have persuaded the judges to adopt his own opinion, or, if they had shown their partiality for unjust laws, and condemned him to death notwithstanding his praising and commending such things, the demons would have bestowed on his soul such rewards as he deserved, who, in order to proclaim and set forth their divine works, had not feared the loss of his human life.&#160; As our martyrs, when that religion was charged on them as a crime, by which they knew they were made safe and most glorious throughout eternity, did not choose, by denying it, to escape temporal punishments, but rather by confessing, professing, and proclaiming it, by enduring all things for it with fidelity and fortitude, and by dying for it with pious calmness, put to shame the law by which that religion was prohibited, and caused its revocation.&#160; But there is extant a most copious and eloquent oration of this Platonic philosopher, in which he defends himself against the charge of practising these arts, affirming that he is wholly a stranger to them, and only wishing to show his innocence by denying such things as cannot be innocently committed.&#160; But all the miracles of the magicians, who he thinks are justly deserving of condemnation, are performed according to the teaching and by the power of demons.&#160; Why, then, does he think that they ought to be honored?&#160; For he asserts that they are necessary, in order to present our prayers to the gods, and yet their works are such as we must shun if we wish our prayers to reach the true God.&#160; Again, I ask, what kind of prayers of men does he suppose are presented to the good gods by the demons?&#160; If magical prayers, they will have none such; if lawful prayers, they will not receive them through such beings.&#160; But if a sinner who is penitent pour out prayers, especially if he has committed any crime of sorcery, does he receive pardon through the intercession of those demons by whose instigation and help he has fallen into the sin he mourns? or do the demons themselves, in order that they may merit pardon for the penitent, first become penitents because they have deceived them?&#160; This no one ever said concerning the demons; for had this been the case, they would never have dared to seek for themselves divine honors.&#160; For how should they do so who desired by penitence to obtain the grace of pardon; seeing that such detestable pride could not exist along with a humility worthy of pardon?</p>
