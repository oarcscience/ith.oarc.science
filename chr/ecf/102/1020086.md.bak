<span id="iv.III.13-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.III.13-p1.1"></span>Chapter 13.—By What Right or Agreement The
Romans Obtained Their First Wives.</span>

<span id="iv.III.13-p2"></span>How is it that neither Juno, who with her
husband Jupiter even then cherished

<span id="iv.III.13-p3"></span>“Rome’s sons, the nation of the
gown,” <span id="fr_139"></span>[140](#fn_139.md)

<span id="iv.III.13-p5"></span>nor Venus herself, could assist the
children of the loved Æneas to find wives by some right and equitable
means?  For the lack of this entailed upon the Romans the lamentable
necessity of stealing their wives, and then waging war with their
fathers-in-law; so that the wretched women, before they had recovered
from the wrong done them by their husbands, were dowried with the blood
of their fathers.  “But the Romans conquered their neighbors.”  Yes; but
with what wounds on both sides, and with what sad slaughter of relatives
and neighbors!  The war of Cæsar and Pompey was the contest of only one
<span id="page_49">p. 49</span> <span id="iv.III.13-Page_49"></span>
father-in-law with one son-in-law; and before it began, the daughter of
Cæsar, Pompey’s wife, was already dead.  But with how keen and just an
accent of grief does Lucan <span id="fr_140"></span>[141](#fn_140.md)
exclaim:  “I sing that worse than civil war waged in the plains of
Emathia, and in which the crime was justified by the victory!”

<span id="iv.III.13-p7"></span>The Romans, then, conquered that they
might, with hands stained in the blood of their fathers-in-law, wrench
the miserable girls from their embrace,—girls who dared not weep for
their slain parents, for fear of offending their victorious husbands;
and while yet the battle was raging, stood with their prayers on their
lips, and knew not for whom to utter them.  Such nuptials were certainly
prepared for the Roman people not by Venus, but Bellona; or possibly
that infernal fury Alecto had more liberty to injure them now that Juno
was aiding them, than when the prayers of that goddess had excited her
against Æneas.  Andromache in captivity was happier than these Roman
brides.  For though she was a slave, yet, after she had become the wife
of Pyrrhus, no more Trojans fell by his hand; but the Romans slew in
battle the very fathers of the brides they fondled.  Andromache, the
victor’s captive, could only mourn, not fear, the death of her people. 
The Sabine women, related to men still combatants, feared the death of
their fathers when their husbands went out to battle, and mourned their
death as they returned, while neither their grief nor their fear could
be freely expressed.  For the victories of their husbands, involving the
destruction of fellow-townsmen, relatives, brothers, fathers, caused
either pious agony or cruel exultation.  Moreover, as the fortune of war
is capricious, some of them lost their husbands by the sword of their
parents, while others lost husband and father together in mutual
destruction.  For the Romans by no means escaped with impunity, but they
were driven back within their walls, and defended themselves behind
closed gates; and when the gates were opened by guile, and the enemy
admitted into the town, the Forum itself was the field of a hateful and
fierce engagement of fathers-in-law and sons-in-law.  The ravishers were
indeed quite defeated, and, flying on all sides to their houses, sullied
with new shame their original shameful and lamentable triumph.  It was
at this juncture that Romulus, hoping no more from the valor of his
citizens, prayed Jupiter that they might stand their ground; and from
this occasion the god gained the name of Stator.  But not even thus
would the mischief have been finished, had not the ravished women
themselves flashed out with dishevelled hair, and cast themselves before
their parents, and thus disarmed their just rage, not with the arms of
victory, but with the supplications of filial affection.  Then Romulus,
who could not brook his own brother as a colleague, was compelled to
accept Titus Tatius, king of the Sabines, as his partner on the throne. 
But how long would he who misliked the fellowship of his own
twin-brother endure a stranger?  So, Tatius being slain, Romulus
remained sole king, that he might be the greater god.  See what rights
of marriage these were that fomented unnatural wars.  These were the
Roman leagues of kindred, relationship, alliance, religion.  This was
the life of the city so abundantly protected by the gods.  You see how
many severe things might be said on this theme; but our purpose carries
us past them, and requires our discourse for other matters.
