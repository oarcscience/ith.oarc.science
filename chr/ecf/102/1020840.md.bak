Style.</span>

<span id="v.IV_1.22-p2"></span>51.  But we are not to suppose that it is
against rule to mingle these various styles:  on the contrary, every
variety of style should be introduced so far as is consistent with good
taste.  For when we keep monotonously to one style, we fail to retain
the hearer’s attention; but when we pass from one style to another, the
discourse goes off more gracefully, even though it extend to greater
length.  Each separate style, again, has varieties of its own which
prevent the hearer’s attention from cooling or becoming languid.  We can
bear the subdued style, however, longer without variety than the
majestic style.  For the mental emotion which it is necessary to stir up
in order to carry the hearer’s feelings with us, when once it has been
sufficiently excited, the higher the pitch to which it is raised, can be
maintained the shorter time.  And therefore we must be on our guard,
lest, in striving to carry to a higher point the emotion we have
excited, we rather lose what we have already gained.  But after the
interposition of matter that we have to treat in a quieter style, we can
return with good effect to that which must be treated forcibly, thus
making the tide of eloquence to ebb and flow like the sea.  It follows
from this, that the majestic style, if it is to be long continued, ought
not to be unvaried, but should alternate at intervals with the other
styles; the speech or writing as a whole, however, being referred to
that style which is the prevailing one.
