id="iv.XVI.34-p1.1"></span>Chapter 34.—What is Meant by Abraham’s
Marrying Keturah After Sarah’s Death.</span>

<span id="iv.XVI.34-p2"></span>What did Abraham mean by marrying Keturah
after Sarah’s death?  Far be it from us to suspect him of incontinence,
especially when he had reached such an age and such sanctity of faith. 
Or was he still seeking to beget children, though he held fast, with
most approved faith, the promise of God that his children should be
multiplied out of Isaac as the stars of heaven and the dust of the
earth?  And yet, if Hagar and Ishmael, as the apostle teaches us,
signified the carnal people of the old covenant, why may not Keturah and
her sons also signify the carnal people who think they belong to the new
covenant?  For both are called both the wives and the concubines of
Abraham; but Sarah is never called a concubine (but only a wife).  For
when Hagar is given to Abraham, it is written. “And Sarai, Abram’s wife,
took Hagar the Egyptian, her handmaid, after Abraham had dwelt ten years
in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his
wife.” <span id="fr_948"></span>[949](#fn_948.md)   And of Keturah, whom he
took after Sarah’s departure, we read, “Then again Abraham took a wife,
whose name was Keturah.” <span id="fr_949"></span>[950](#fn_949.md)   Lo!
both are called wives, yet both are found to have been concubines; for
the Scripture afterward says, “And Abraham gave his whole estate unto
Isaac his son.  But unto the sons of his concubines Abraham gave gifts,
and sent them away from his son Isaac, (while he yet lived,) eastward,
unto the east country.” <span id="fr_950"></span>[951](#fn_950.md)  
Therefore the sons of the concubines, that is, the heretics and the
carnal Jews, have some gifts, but do not attain the promised kingdom;
“For they which are the children of the flesh, these are not the
children of God:  but the children of the promise are counted for the
seed, of whom it was said, In Isaac shall thy seed be called.” <span
id="fr_951"></span>[952](#fn_951.md)   For I do not see why Keturah, who
was married after the wife’s death, should be called a concubine, except
on account of this mystery.  But if any one is unwilling to put such
meanings on these things, he need not calumniate Abraham.  For what if
even this was provided against the heretics who were to be the opponents
of second marriages, so that it might be shown that it was no sin in the
case of the father of many nations himself, when, after his wife’s
death, he married again?  And Abraham died when he was 175 years old, so
that he left his son Isaac seventy-five years old, having begotten him
when 100 years old.
