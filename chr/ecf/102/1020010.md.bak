<span id="iv.ii.v-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.ii.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter 4.—Of the Asylum of Juno in Troy, Which
Saved No One from the Greeks; And of the Churches of the Apostles, Which
Protected from the Barbarians All Who Fled to Them.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.v-p2"></span>Troy itself, the mother of the Roman
people, was not able, as I have said, to protect its own citizens in the
sacred places of their gods from the fire and sword of the Greeks,
though the Greeks worshipped the same gods.  Not only so, but

<span id="iv.ii.v-p3"></span>“Phoenix and Ulysses fell

<span id="iv.ii.v-p4"></span>In the void courts by Juno’s cell

<span id="iv.ii.v-p5"></span>Were set the spoils to keep;

<span id="iv.ii.v-p6"></span>Snatched from the burning shrines away,

<span id="iv.ii.v-p7"></span>There Ilium’s mighty treasure lay,

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span> <span id="iv.ii.v-Page_4"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.v-p8"></span>Rich altars, bowls of massy gold,

<span id="iv.ii.v-p9"></span>And captive raiment, rudely rolled

<span id="iv.ii.v-p10"></span>In one promiscuous heap;

<span id="iv.ii.v-p11"></span>While boys and matrons, wild with fear,

<span id="iv.ii.v-p12"></span>In long array were standing near.” <span
id="fr_42"></span>[43](#fn_42.md)

<span id="iv.ii.v-p14"></span> In other words, the place consecrated to
so great a goddess was chosen, not that from it none might be led out a
captive, but that in it all the captives might be immured.  Compare now
this “asylum”—the asylum not of an ordinary god, not of one of the rank
and file of gods, but of Jove’s own sister and wife, the queen of all
the gods—with the churches built in memory of the apostles.  Into it
were collected the spoils rescued from the blazing temples and snatched
from the gods, not that they might be restored to the vanquished, but
divided among the victors; while into these was carried back, with the
most religious observance and respect, everything which belonged to
them, even though found elsewhere.  There liberty was lost; here
preserved.  There bondage was strict; here strictly excluded.  Into that
temple men were driven to become the chattels of their enemies, now
lording it over them; into these churches men were led by their
relenting foes, that they might be at liberty.  In fine, the
gentle <span id="fr_43"></span>[44](#fn_43.md) Greeks appropriated that
temple of Juno to the purposes of their own avarice and pride; while
these churches of Christ were chosen even by the savage barbarians as
the fit scenes for humility and mercy.  But perhaps, after all, the
Greeks did in that victory of theirs spare the temples of those gods
whom they worshipped in common with the Trojans, and did not dare to put
to the sword or make captive the wretched and vanquished Trojans who
fled thither; and perhaps Virgil, in the manner of poets, has depicted
what never really happened?  But there is no question that he depicted
the usual custom of an enemy when sacking a city.

<span id="iv.ii.v-p15"></span> Though *levis* was the word usually
employed to signify the inconstancy of the Greeks, it is evidently here
used, in opposition to *immanis* of the following clause, to indicate
that the Greeks were more civilized than the barbarians, and not
relentless, but, as we say, easily moved.
