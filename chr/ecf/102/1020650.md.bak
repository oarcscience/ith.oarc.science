id="iv.XXI.17-p1.1"></span>Chapter 17.—Of Those Who Fancy that No Men
Shall Be Punished Eternally.</span>

<span id="iv.XXI.17-p2"></span>I must now, I see, enter the lists of
amicable controversy with those tender-hearted Christians who decline to
believe that any, or that all of those whom the infallibly just Judge
may pronounce worthy of the punishment of hell, shall suffer eternally,
and who suppose that they shall be delivered after a fixed term of
punishment, longer or shorter according to the amount of each man’s
sin.  In respect of this matter, Origen was even more indulgent; for he
believed that even the devil himself and his angels, after suffering
those more severe and prolonged pains which their sins deserved, should
be delivered from their torments, and associated with the holy angels. 
But the Church, not without reason, condemned him for this and other
errors, especially for his theory of the ceaseless alternation of
happiness and misery, and the interminable transitions from the one
state to the other at fixed periods of ages; for in this theory he lost
even the credit of being merciful, by allotting to the saints real
miseries for the expiation of their sins, and false happiness, which
brought them no true and secure joy, that is, no fearless assurance of
eternal blessedness.  Very different, however, is the error we speak of,
which is dictated by the tenderness of these Christians who suppose that
the sufferings of those who are condemned in the judgment will be
temporary, while the blessedness of all who are sooner or later set free
will be eternal.  Which opinion, if it is good and true because it is
merciful, will be so much the better and truer in proportion as it
becomes more merciful.  Let, then, this fountain of mercy be extended,
and flow forth even to the lost angels, and let them also be set free,
at least after as many and long ages as seem fit!  Why does this stream
of mercy flow to all the human race, and dry up as soon as it reaches
the angelic?  And yet they dare not extend their pity further, and
propose the deliverance of the devil himself.  Or if any one is bold
enough to do so, he does indeed put to shame their charity, but is
himself convicted of error that is more unsightly, and a wresting of
God’s truth that is more perverse, in proportion as his clemency of
sentiment seems to be greater. <span

<span id="iv.XXI.17-p3"></span> On the heresy of Origen, see Epiphanius
(*Epistola ad Joannem Hierosol.*); Jerome (*Epistola* 61, *ad*
*Pammachium*); and Augustin (*De Hæres*, 43).  Origen’s opinion was
condemned by Anastasius (Jerome, *Apologia adv. Ruffinum* and *Epistola*
78, *ad Pammachium*), and after Augustin’s death by Vigilius and Emperor
Justinian, in the Fifth (Œcumenical Council, Nicephorus Callistus, xvii.
27, and the *Acts of the Council*, iv. 11).—<span class="c20"><span
