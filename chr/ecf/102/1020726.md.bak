<span id="v.iv.xxx-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="v.iv.xxx-p1.1"></span>Chapter 30.—Whether Angels are to Be Reckoned
Our Neighbors.</span>

<span id="v.iv.xxx-p2"></span>31.  There arises further in this
connection a question about angels.  For they are happy in the enjoyment
of Him whom we long to enjoy; and the more we enjoy Him in this life as
through a glass darkly, the more easy do we find it to bear our
pilgrimage, and the more eagerly do we long for its termination.  But it
is not irrational to ask whether in those two commandments is included
the love of angels also.  For that He who commanded us to love our
neighbor made no exception, as far as men are concerned, is shown both
by our Lord Himself in the Gospel, and by the Apostle Paul.  For when
the man to whom our Lord delivered those two commandments, and to whom
He said that on these hang all the law and the prophets, asked Him, “And
who is my neighbor?” He told him of a certain man who, going down from
Jerusalem to Jericho, fell among thieves, and was <span id="page_531">p.
531</span> <span id="v.iv.xxx-Page_531"></span> severely wounded by
them, and left naked and half dead. <span
id="fr_1738"></span>[1739](#fn_1738.md)   And He showed him that nobody was
neighbor to this man except him who took pity upon him and came forward
to relieve and care for him.  And the man who had asked the question
admitted the truth of this when he was himself interrogated in turn.  To
whom our Lord says, “Go and do thou likewise;” teaching us that he is
our neighbor whom it is our duty to help in his need, or whom it would
be our duty to help if he were in need.  Whence it follows, that he
whose duty it would be in turn to help us is our neighbor.  For the name
“neighbor” is a relative one, and no one can be neighbor except to a
neighbor.  And, again, who does not see that no exception is made of any
one as a person to whom the offices of mercy may be denied when our Lord
extends the rule even to our enemies?  “Love your enemies, do good to
them that hate you.” <span id="fr_1739"></span>[1740](#fn_1739.md)

<span id="v.iv.xxx-p5"></span>32.  And so also the Apostle Paul teaches
when he says:  “For this, Thou shall not commit adultery, Thou shall not
kill, Thou shall not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou
shall not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly
comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shall love thy neighbor as
thyself.  Love worketh no ill to his neighbor.” <span
id="fr_1740"></span>[1741](#fn_1740.md)   Whoever then supposes that the
apostle did not embrace every man in this precept, is compelled to
admit, what is at once most absurd and most pernicious, that the apostle
thought it no sin, if a man were not a Christian or were an enemy, to
commit adultery with his wife, or to kill him, or to covet his goods. 
And as nobody but a fool would say this, it is clear that every man is
to be considered our neighbor, because we are to work no ill to any man.

<span id="v.iv.xxx-p7"></span>33.  But now, if every one to whom we
ought to show, or who ought to show to us, the offices of mercy is by
right called a neighbor, it is manifest that the command to love our
neighbor embraces the holy angels also, seeing that so great offices of
mercy have been performed by them on our behalf, as may easily be shown
by turning the attention to many passages of Holy Scripture.  And on
this ground even God Himself, our Lord, desired to be called our
neighbor.  For our Lord Jesus Christ points to Himself under the figure
of the man who brought aid to him who was lying half dead on the road,
wounded and abandoned by the robbers.  And the Psalmist says in his
prayer, “I behaved myself as though he had been my friend or
brother.” <span id="fr_1741"></span>[1742](#fn_1741.md)   But as the Divine
nature is of higher excellence than, and far removed above, our nature,
the command to love God is distinct from that to love our neighbor.  For
He shows us pity on account of His own goodness, but we show pity to one
another on account of His;—that is, He pities us that we may fully enjoy
Himself; we pity one another that we may fully enjoy Him.
