id="iv.IV.12-p1.1"></span>Chapter 12.—Concerning the Opinion of Those
Who Have Thought that God is the Soul of the World, and the World is the
Body of God.</span>

<span id="iv.IV.12-p2"></span>Ought not men of intelligence, and indeed
men of every kind, to be stirred up to examine the nature of this
opinion?  For there is no need of excellent capacity for this task, that
putting away the desire of contention, they may observe that if God is
the soul of the world, and the world is as a body to Him, who is the
soul, He must be one living being consisting of soul and body, and that
this same God is a kind of womb of nature containing all things in
Himself, so that the lives and souls of all living things are taken,
according to the manner of each one’s birth, out of His soul which
vivifies that whole mass, and therefore nothing at all remains which is
not a part of God.  And if this is so, who cannot see what impious and
irreligious consequences follow, such as that whatever one may trample,
he must trample a part of God, and in slaying any living creature, a
part of God must be slaughtered?  But I am unwilling to utter all that
may occur to those who think of it, yet cannot be spoken without
irreverence.
