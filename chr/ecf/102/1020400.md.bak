<span id="iv.XIV.8-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XIV.8-p1.1"></span>Chapter 8.—Of the Three Perturbations, Which
the Stoics Admitted in the Soul of the Wise Man to the Exclusion of
Grief or Sadness, Which the Manly Mind Ought Not to Experience.</span>

<span id="iv.XIV.8-p2"></span>Those emotions which the Greeks call <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.XIV.8-p2.1"></span>εὐπαθείαι</span>, and
which Cicero calls *constantiœ*, the Stoics would restrict to three;
and, instead of three “perturbations” in the soul of the wise man, they
substituted severally, in place of desire, will; in place of joy,
contentment; and for fear, caution; and as to sickness or pain, which
we, to avoid ambiguity, preferred to call sorrow, they denied that it
could exist in the mind of a wise man.  Will, they say, seeks the good,
for this the wise man does.  Contentment has its object in good that is
possessed, and this the wise man continually possesses.  Caution avoids
evil, and this the wise man ought to avoid.  But sorrow arises from evil
that has already happened; and as they suppose that no evil can happen
to the wise man, there can be no representative of sorrow in his mind. 
According to them, therefore, none but the wise man wills, is contented,
uses caution; and that the fool can do no more than desire, rejoice,
fear, be sad.  The former three affections Cicero calls *constantiœ*,
the last four *perturbationes*.  Many, however, calls these last
*passions*; and, as I have said, the Greeks call the former <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.XIV.8-p2.2"></span>εὐπαθείαι</span>, and the
latter <span class="Greek"><span id="iv.XIV.8-p2.3"></span>πάθη</span>. 
And when I made a careful examination of Scripture to find whether this
terminology was sanctioned by it, I came upon this saying of the
prophet:  “There is no contentment to the wicked, saith the Lord;” <span
id="fr_676"></span>[677](#fn_676.md) as if the wicked might more properly
rejoice than be contented regarding evils, for contentment is the
property of the good and godly.  I found also that verse in the Gospel: 
“Whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, do ye even so unto
them?” <span id="fr_677"></span>[678](#fn_677.md) which seems to imply that
evil or shameful things may be the object of desire, but not of will. 
Indeed, some interpreters have added “good things,” to make the
expression more in conformity with customary usage, and have given this
meaning, “Whatsoever good deeds that ye would that men should do unto
you.”  For they thought that this would prevent any one from wishing
other men to provide him with unseemly, not to say shameful
gratifications,—luxurious banquets, for example,—on the supposition that
if he returned the like to them he would be fulfilling this precept.  In
the Greek Gospel, however, from which the Latin is translated, “good”
does not occur, but only, “All things whatsoever ye would that men
should do unto you, do ye even so unto them,” and, as I believe, because
“good” is already included in the word “would;” for He does not say
“desire.”

<span id="iv.XIV.8-p5"></span>Yet though we may sometimes avail
ourselves of these precise proprieties of language, we are not to be
always bridled by them; and when we read those writers against whose
authority it is unlawful to reclaim, we must accept the meanings above
mentioned in passages where a right sense can be educed by no other
interpretation, as in those instances we adduced partly from the
prophet, partly from the Gospel.  For who does not know that the wicked
exult with joy?  Yet “there is no *contentment* for the wicked, saith
the Lord.” <span id="page_268">p. 268</span> <span
id="iv.XIV.8-Page_268"></span> And how so, unless because contentment,
when the word is used in its proper and distinctive significance, means
something different from joy?  In like manner, who would deny that it
were wrong to enjoin upon men that whatever they desire others to do to
them they should themselves do to others, lest they should mutually
please one another by shameful and illicit pleasure?  And yet the
precept, “Whatsoever ye *would* that men should do unto you, do ye even
so to them,” is very wholesome and just.  And how is this, unless
because the will is in this place used strictly, and signifies that will
which cannot have evil for its object?  But ordinary phraseology would
not have allowed the saying, “Be unwilling to make any manner of
lie,” <span id="fr_678"></span>[679](#fn_678.md) had there not been also an
evil will, whose wickedness separates if from that which the angels
celebrated, “Peace on earth, of good will to men.” <span
id="fr_679"></span>[680](#fn_679.md)   For “good” is superfluous if there
is no other kind of will but good will.  And why should the apostle have
mentioned it among the praises of charity as a great thing, that “it
rejoices not in iniquity,” unless because wickedness does so rejoice? 
For even with secular writers these words are used indifferently.  For
Cicero, that most fertile of orators, says, “I desire, conscript
fathers, to be merciful.” <span id="fr_680"></span>[681](#fn_680.md)   And
who would be so pedantic as to say that he should have said “I will”
rather than “I desire,” because the word is used in a good connection? 
Again, in Terence, the profligate youth, burning with wild lust, says,
“I will nothing else than Philumena.” <span
id="fr_681"></span>[682](#fn_681.md)   That this “will” was lust is
sufficiently indicated by the answer of his old servant which is there
introduced:  “How much better were it to try and banish that love from
your heart, than to speak so as uselessly to inflame your passion still
more!”  And that contentment was used by secular writers in a bad sense
that verse of Virgil testifies, in which he most succinctly comprehends
these four perturbations,—

<span id="iv.XIV.8-p10"></span>“Hence they fear and desire, grieve and
are content” <span id="fr_682"></span>[683](#fn_682.md)

<span id="iv.XIV.8-p12"></span>The same author had also used the
expression, “the evil contentments of the mind.” <span
id="fr_683"></span>[684](#fn_683.md)   So that good and bad men alike will,
are cautious, and contented; or, to say the same thing in other words,
good and bad men alike desire, fear, rejoice, but the former in a good,
the latter in a bad fashion, according as the will is right or wrong. 
Sorrow itself, too, which the Stoics would not allow to be represented
in the mind of the wise man, is used in a good sense, and especially in
our writings.  For the apostle praises the Corinthians because they had
a godly sorrow.  But possibly some one may say that the apostle
congratulated them because they were penitently sorry, and that such
sorrow can exist only in those who have sinned.  For these are his
words:  “For I perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry,
though it were but for a season.  Now I rejoice, not that ye were made
sorry, but that ye sorrowed to repentance; for ye were made sorry after
a godly manner, that ye might receive damage by us in nothing.  For
godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of, but
the sorrow of the world worketh death.  For, behold, this selfsame thing
that ye sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it wrought in
you!” <span id="fr_684"></span>[685](#fn_684.md)   Consequently the Stoics
may defend themselves by replying, <span
id="fr_685"></span>[686](#fn_685.md) that sorrow is indeed useful for
repentance of sin, but that this can have no place in the mind of the
wise man, inasmuch as no sin attaches to him of which he could
sorrowfully repent, nor any other evil the endurance or experience of
which could make him sorrowful.  For they say that Alcibiades (if my
memory does not deceive me), who believed himself happy, shed tears when
Socrates argued with him, and demonstrated that he was miserable because
he was foolish.  In his case, therefore, folly was the cause of this
useful and desirable sorrow, wherewith a man mourns that he is what he
ought not to be.  But the Stoics maintain not that the fool, but that
the wise man, cannot be sorrowful.
