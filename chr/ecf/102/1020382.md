<span id="iv.XIII.15-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XIII.15-p1.1"></span>Chapter 15.—That Adam in His Sin Forsook God
Ere God Forsook Him, and that His Falling Away From God Was the First
Death of the Soul.</span>

<span id="iv.XIII.15-p2"></span>It may perhaps be supposed that because
God said, “Ye shall die the death,” <span
id="fr_594"></span>[595](#fn_594) and not “deaths,” we should understand
only that death which occurs when the soul is deserted by God, who is
its life; for it was not deserted by God, and so deserted Him, but
deserted Him, and so was deserted by Him.  For its own will was the
originator of its evil, as God was the originator of its motions towards
good, both in making it when it was not, and in remaking it when it had
fallen and perished.  But though we suppose that God meant only this
death, and that the words, “In the day ye eat of it ye shall die the
death,” should be understood as meaning, “In the day ye desert me in
disobedience, I will desert you in justice,” yet assuredly in this death
the other deaths also were threatened, which were its inevitable
consequence.  For in the first stirring of the disobedient motion which
was felt in the flesh of the disobedient soul, and which caused our
first parents to cover their shame, one death indeed is experienced,
that, namely, which occurs when God forsakes the soul.  (This was
intimated by the words He uttered, when the man, stupefied by fear, had
hid himself, “Adam, where art thou?” <span
id="fr_595"></span>[596](#fn_595) —words which He used not in ignorance
of inquiry, but warning him to consider where he was, since God was not
with him.)  But when the soul itself forsook the body, corrupted and
decayed with age, the other death was experienced of which God had
spoken in pronouncing man’s sentence, “Earth thou art, and unto earth
shall thou return.” <span id="fr_596"></span>[597](#fn_596)   And of
these two deaths that first death of the whole man is composed.  And
this first death is finally followed by the second, unless man be freed
by grace.  For the body would not return to the <span id="page_252">p.
252</span> <span id="iv.XIII.15-Page_252"></span> earth from which it
was made, save only by the death proper to itself, which occurs when it
is forsaken of the soul, its life.  And therefore it is agreed among all
Christians who truthfully hold the catholic faith, that we are subject
to the death of the body, not by the law of nature, by which God
ordained no death for man, but by His righteous infliction on account of
sin; for God, taking vengeance on sin, said to the man, in whom we all
then were, “Dust thou art, and unto dust shall thou return.”
