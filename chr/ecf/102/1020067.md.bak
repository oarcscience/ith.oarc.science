<span id="iv.II_1.24-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.II_1.24-p1.1"></span>Chapter 24.—Of the Deeds of Sylla, in Which
the Demons Boasted that He Had Their Help.</span>

<span id="iv.II_1.24-p2"></span>It is certain that Sylla—whose rule was
so cruel that, in comparison with it, the preceding state of things
which he came to avenge was regretted—when first he advanced towards
Rome to give battle to Marius, found the auspices so favourable when he
sacrificed, that, according to Livy’s account, the augur Postumius
expressed his willingness to lose his head if Sylla did not, with the
help of the gods, accomplish what he designed.  The gods, you see, had
not departed from “every fane and sacred shrine,” since they were still
predicting the issue of these affairs, and yet were taking no steps to
correct Sylla himself.  Their presages promised him great prosperity but
no threatenings of theirs subdued his evil passions.  And then, when he
was in Asia conducting the war against Mithridates, a message from
Jupiter was delivered to him by Lucius Titius, to the effect that he
would conquer Mithridates; and so it came to pass.  And afterwards, when
he was meditating a return to Rome for the purpose of avenging in the
blood of the citizens injuries done to himself and his friends, a second
message from Jupiter was delivered to him by a soldier of the sixth
legion, to the effect that it was he who had predicted the victory over
Mithridates, and that now he promised to give him power to recover the
republic from his enemies, though with great bloodshed.  Sylla at once
inquired of the soldier what form had appeared to him; and, on his
reply, recognized that it was the same as Jupiter had formerly employed
to convey to him the assurance regarding the victory over Mithridates. 
How, then, can the gods be justified in this matter for the care they
took to predict these shadowy successes, and for their negligence in
correcting Sylla, and restraining him from stirring up a civil war so
lamentable and atrocious, that it not merely disfigured, but
extinguished, the republic?  The truth is, as I have often said, and as
Scripture informs us, and as the facts themselves sufficiently indicate,
the demons are found to look after their own ends only, that they may be
regarded and worshipped as gods, and that men may be induced to offer to
them a worship which associates them with their crimes, and involves
them in one common wickedness and judgment of God.

<span id="iv.II_1.24-p3"></span>Afterwards, when Sylla had come to
Tarentum, and had sacrificed there, he saw on the head of the victim’s
liver the likeness of a golden crown.  Thereupon the same soothsayer
Postumius interpreted this to signify a signal victory, and ordered that
he only should eat of the entrails.  A little afterwards, the slave of a
certain Lucius Pontius cried out, “I am Bellona’s messenger; the victory
is yours, Sylla!”  Then he added that the Capitol should be burned.  As
soon as he had uttered this prediction he left the camp, but returned
the following day more excited than ever, and shouted, “The Capitol is
fired!”  And fired indeed it was.  This it was easy for a demon both to
foresee and quickly to announce.  But observe, as relevant to our
subject, what kind of gods they are under whom these men desire to live,
who blaspheme the Saviour that delivers the wills of the faithful from
the dominion of devils.  The man cried <span id="page_39">p. 39</span>
<span id="iv.II_1.24-Page_39"></span> out in prophetic rapture, “The
victory is yours, Sylla!”  And to certify that he spoke by a divine
spirit, he predicted also an event which was shortly to happen, and
which indeed did fall out, in a place from which he in whom this spirit
was speaking was far distant.  But he never cried, “Forbear thy
villanies, Sylla!”—the villanies which were committed at Rome by that
victor to whom a golden crown on the calf’s liver had been shown as the
divine evidence of his victory.  If such signs as this were customarily
sent by just gods, and not by wicked demons, then certainly the entrails
he consulted should rather have given Sylla intimation of the cruel
disasters that were to befall the city and himself.  For that victory
was not so conducive to his exaltation to power, as it was fatal to his
ambition; for by it he became so insatiable in his desires, and was
rendered so arrogant and reckless by prosperity, that he may be said
rather to have inflicted a moral destruction on himself than corporal
destruction on his enemies.  But these truely woeful and deplorable
calamities the gods gave him no previous hint of, neither by entrails,
augury, dream, nor prediction.  For they feared his amendment more than
his defeat.  Yea, they took good care that this glorious conqueror of
his own fellow-citizens should be conquered and led captive by his own
infamous vices, and should thus be the more submissive slave of the
demons themselves.
