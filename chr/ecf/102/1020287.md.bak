<span id="iv.X.16-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.X.16-p1.1"></span>Chapter 16.—Whether Those Angels Who Demand
that We Pay Them Divine Honor, or Those Who Teach Us to Render Holy
Service, Not to Themselves, But to God, are to Be Trusted About the Way
to Life Eternal.</span>

<span id="iv.X.16-p2"></span>What angels, then, are we to believe in
this matter of blessed and eternal life?—those who wish to be worshipped
with religious rites and observances, and require that men sacrifice to
them; or those who say that all this worship is due to one God, the
Creator, and teach us to render it with true piety to Him, by the vision
of whom they are themselves already blessed, and in whom they promise
that we shall be so?  For that vision of God is the beauty of a vision
so great, and is so infinitely desirable, that Plotinus does not
hesitate to say that he who enjoys all other blessings in abundance, and
has not this, is supremely miserable. <span
id="fr_409"></span>[410](#fn_409.md)   Since, therefore, miracles are
wrought by some angels to induce us to worship this God, by others, to
induce us to worship themselves; and since the former forbid us to
worship these, while the latter dare not forbid us to worship God, which
are we to listen to?  Let the Platonists reply, or any philosophers, or
the theurgists, or rather, *periurgists*, <span
id="fr_410"></span>[411](#fn_410.md) —for this name is good enough for
those who practise such arts.  In short, let all men answer,—if, at
least, there survives in them any spark of that natural perception
which, as rational beings, they possess when created,—let them, I say,
tell us whether we should sacrifice to the gods or angels who order us
to sacrifice to them, or to that One to whom we are ordered to sacrifice
by those who forbid us to worship either themselves or these others.  If
neither the one party nor the other had wrought miracles, but had merely
uttered commands, the one to sacrifice to themselves, the other
forbidding that, and ordering us to sacrifice to God, a godly mind would
have been at no loss to discern which command proceeded from proud
arrogance, and which from true religion.  I will say more.  If miracles
had been wrought only by those who demand sacrifice for themselves,
while those who forbade this, and enjoined sacrificing to the one God
only, thought fit entirely to forego the use of visible miracles, the
authority of the latter was to be preferred by all who would use, not
their eyes only, but their reason.  But since God, for the sake of
commending to us the oracles of His truth, has, by means of these
immortal messengers, who proclaim His majesty and not their own pride,
wrought miracles of surpassing grandeur, certainty, and distinctness, in
order that the weak among the godly might not be drawn away to false
religion by those who require us to sacrifice to them and endeavor to
convince us by stupendous appeals to our senses, who is so utterly
unreasonable as not to choose and follow the truth, when he finds that
it is heralded by even more striking evidences than falsehood?

<span id="iv.X.16-p5"></span>As for those miracles which history
ascribes to the gods of the heathen,—I do not refer to those prodigies
which at intervals happen from some unknown physical causes, and which
are arranged and appointed by Divine Providence, such as monstrous
births, and unusual meteorological phenomena, whether startling only,
<span id="page_191">p. 191</span> <span id="iv.X.16-Page_191"></span> or
also injurious, and which are said to be brought about and removed by
communication with demons, and by their most deceitful craft,—but I
refer to these prodigies which manifestly enough are wrought by their
power and force, as, that the household gods which Æneas carried from
Troy in his flight moved from place to place; that Tarquin cut a
whetstone with a razor; that the Epidaurian serpent attached himself as
a companion to Æsculapius on his voyage to Rome; that the ship in which
the image of the Phrygian mother stood, and which could not be moved by
a host of men and oxen, was moved by one weak woman, who attached her
girdle to the vessel and drew it, as proof of her chastity; that a
vestal, whose virginity was questioned, removed the suspicion by
carrying from the Tiber a sieve full of water without any of it
dropping:  these, then, and the like, are by no means to be compared for
greatness and virtue to those which, we read, were wrought among God’s
people.  How much less can we compare those marvels, which even the laws
of heathen nations prohibit and punish,—I mean the magical and theurgic
marvels, of which the great part are merely illusions practised upon the
senses, as the drawing down of the moon, “that,” as Lucan says, “it may
shed a stronger influence on the plants?” <span
id="fr_411"></span>[412](#fn_411.md)   And if some of these do seem to
equal those which are wrought by the godly, the end for which they are
wrought distinguishes the two, and shows that ours are incomparably the
more excellent.  For those miracles commend the worship of a plurality
of gods, who deserve worship the less the more they demand it; but these
of ours commend the worship of the one God, who, both by the testimony
of His own Scriptures, and by the eventual abolition of sacrifices,
proves that He needs no such offerings.  If, therefore, any angels
demand sacrifice for themselves, we must prefer those who demand it, not
for themselves, but for God, the Creator of all, whom they serve.  For
thus they prove how sincerely they love us, since they wish by sacrifice
to subject us, not to themselves, but to Him by the contemplation of
whom they themselves are blessed, and to bring us to Him from whom they
themselves have never strayed.  If, on the other hand, any angels wish
us to sacrifice, not to one, but to many, not, indeed, to themselves,
but to the gods whose angels they are, we must in this case also prefer
those who are the angels of the one God of gods, and who so bid us to
worship Him as to preclude our worshipping any other.  But, further, if
it be the case, as their pride and deceitfulness rather indicate, that
they are neither good angels nor the angels of good gods, but wicked
demons, who wish sacrifice to be paid, not to the one only and supreme
God, but to themselves, what better protection against them can we
choose than that of the one God whom the good angels serve, the angels
who bid us sacrifice, not to themselves, but to Him whose sacrifice we
ourselves ought to be?
