<span id="iv.VI.2"></span>

<span id="iv.VI.2-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.VI.2-p1.1"></span>Chapter 2.—What We are to Believe that Varro
Thought Concerning the Gods of the Nations, Whose Various Kinds and
Sacred Rites He Has Shown to Be Such that He Would Have Acted More
Reverently Towards Them Had He Been Altogether Silent Concerning
Them.</span>

<span id="iv.VI.2-p2"></span>Who has investigated those things more
carefully than Marcus Varro?  Who has discovered them more learnedly? 
Who has considered them more attentively?  Who has distinguished them
more acutely?  Who has written about them more diligently and more
fully?—who, though he is less pleasing in his eloquence, is nevertheless
so full of instruction and wisdom, that in all the erudition which we
call secular, but they liberal, he will teach the student of things as
much as Cicero delights the student of words.  And even Tully himself
renders him such testimony, as to say in his Academic books that he had
held that disputation which is there carried on with Marcus Varro, “a
man,” he adds, “unquestionably the acutest of all men, and, without any
doubt, the most learned.” <span id="fr_234"></span>[235](#fn_234.md)   He
does not say the most eloquent or the most fluent, for in reality he was
very deficient in this faculty, but he says, “of all men the most
acute.”  And in those books,—that is, the Academic,—where he contends
that all things are to be doubted, he adds of him, “without any doubt
the most learned.”  In truth, he was so certain concerning this thing,
that he laid aside that doubt which he is wont to have recourse to in
all things, as if, when about to dispute in favor of the doubt of the
Academics, he had, with respect to this one thing, forgotten that he was
an Academic.  But in the first book, when he extols the literary works
of the same Varro, he says, “Us straying and wandering in our own city
like strangers, thy books, as it were, brought home, that at length we
might come to know of who we were and where we were.  Thou has opened up
to us the age of the country, the distribution of seasons, the laws of
sacred things, and of the priests; thou hast opened up to us domestic
and public discipline; thou hast pointed out to us the proper places for
religious ceremonies, and hast informed us concerning sacred places. 
Thou hast shown us the names, kinds, offices, causes of all divine and
human things.” <span id="fr_235"></span>[236](#fn_235.md)

<span id="iv.VI.2-p5"></span>This man, then, of so distinguished and
excellent acquirements, and, as Terentian briefly says of him in a most
elegant verse,

<span id="iv.VI.2-p6"></span>“Varro, a man universally informed,” <span
id="fr_236"></span>[237](#fn_236.md)

<span id="iv.VI.2-p8"></span>who read so much that we wonder when he had
time to write, wrote so much that we can scarcely believe any one could
have read it all,—this man, I say, so great in talent, so great in
learning, had he had been an opposer and destroyer of the so-called
divine things of which he wrote, and had he said that they pertained to
superstition rather than to religion, might perhaps, even in that case,
not have written so many things which are ridiculous, contemptible,
detestable.  But when he so worshipped these same gods, and so
vindicated <span id="page_111">p. 111</span> <span
id="iv.VI.2-Page_111"></span> their worship, as to say, in that same
literary work of his, that he was afraid lest they should perish, not by
an assault by enemies, but by the negligence of the citizens, and that
from this ignominy they are being delivered by him, and are being laid
up and preserved in the memory of the good by means of such books, with
a zeal far more beneficial than that through which Metellus is declared
to have rescued the sacred things of Vesta from the flames, and Æneas to
have rescued the Penates from the burning of Troy; and when he
nevertheless, gives forth such things to be read by succeeding ages as
are deservedly judged by wise and unwise to be unfit to be read, and to
be most hostile to the truth of religion; what ought we to think but
that a most acute and learned man,—not, however made free by the Holy
Spirit,—was overpowered by the custom and laws of his state, and, not
being able to be silent about those things by which he was influenced,
spoke of them under pretence of commending religion?
