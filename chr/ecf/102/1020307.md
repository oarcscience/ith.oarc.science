<span id="iv.XI.3-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XI.3-p1.1"></span>Chapter 3.—Of the Authority of the Canonical
Scriptures Composed by the Divine Spirit.</span>

<span id="iv.XI.3-p2"></span>This Mediator, having spoken what He judged
sufficient first by the prophets, then by His own lips, and afterwards
by the apostles, has besides produced the Scripture which is called
canonical, which has paramount authority, and to which we yield assent
in all matters of which we ought not to be ignorant, and yet cannot know
of ourselves.  For if we attain the knowledge of present objects by the
testimony of our own senses, <span id="fr_450"></span>[451](#fn_450)
whether internal or external, then, regarding objects remote from our
own senses, we need others to bring their testimony, since we cannot
know them by our own, and we credit the persons to whom the objects have
been or are sensibly present.  Accordingly, as in the case of visible
objects which we have not seen, we trust those who have, (and likewise
with all sensible objects,) so in the case of things which are
perceived <span id="fr_451"></span>[452](#fn_451) by the mind and
spirit, *i.e*., which are remote from our own interior sense, it behoves
us to trust those who have seen them set in that incorporeal light, or
abidingly contemplate them.
