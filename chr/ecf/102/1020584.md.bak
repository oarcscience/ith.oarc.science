<span id="iv.XIX.11-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XIX.11-p1.1"></span>Chapter 11.—Of the Happiness of the Eternal
Peace, Which Constitutes the End or True Perfection of the
Saints.</span>

<span id="iv.XIX.11-p2"></span>And thus we may say of peace, as we have
said of eternal life, that it is the end of our good; and the rather
because the Psalmist says of the city of God, the subject of this
laborious work, “Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem; praise thy God, O Zion: 
for He hath strengthened the bars of thy gates; He hath blessed thy
children within thee; who hath made thy borders peace.” <span
id="fr_1277"></span>[1278](#fn_1277.md)   For when the bars of her gates
shall be strengthened, none shall go in or come out from her;
consequently we ought to understand the peace of her borders as that
final peace we are wishing to declare.  For even the mystical name of
the city itself, that is, *Jerusalem*, means, as I have already said,
“Vision of Peace.”  But as the word peace is employed in connection with
things in this world in which certainly life eternal has no place, we
have preferred to call the end or supreme good of this city life eternal
rather than peace.  Of this end the apostle says, “But now, being freed
from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness,
and the end life eternal.” <span id="fr_1278"></span>[1279](#fn_1278.md)  
But, on the other hand, as those who are not familiar with Scripture may
suppose that the life of the wicked is eternal life, either because of
the immortality of the soul, which some of the philosophers even have
recognized, or because of the endless punishment of the wicked, which
forms a part of our faith, and which seems impossible unless the wicked
live for ever, it may therefore be advisable, in order that every one
may readily understand what we mean, to say that the end or supreme good
of this city is either peace in eternal life, or eternal life in peace. 
For peace is a good so great, that even in this earthly and mortal life
there is no word we hear with such pleasure, nothing we desire with such
zest, or find to be more thoroughly gratifying.  So that if we dwell for
a little longer on this subject, we shall not, in my opinion, be
wearisome to our readers, who will attend both for the sake of
understanding what is the end of this city of which we speak, and for
the sake of the sweetness of peace which is dear to all.
