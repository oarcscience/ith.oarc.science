<span id="v.IV_1.28-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="v.IV_1.28-p1.1"></span>Chapter 28.—Truth is More Important Than
Expression.  What is Meant by Strife About Words.</span>

<span id="v.IV_1.28-p2"></span>61.  Such a teacher as is here described
may, to secure compliance, speak not only quietly and temperately, but
even vehemently, without any breach of modesty, because his life
protects him against contempt.  For while he pursues an upright life, he
takes care to maintain a good reputation as well, providing things
honest in the sight of God and men, <span
id="fr_2013"></span>[2014](#fn_2013) fearing God, and caring for men. 
In his very speech even he prefers to please by matter rather than by
words; thinks that a thing is well said in proportion as it is true in
fact, and that a teacher should govern his words, not let the words
govern him.  This is what the apostle says:  “Not with wisdom of words,
lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect.” <span
id="fr_2014"></span>[2015](#fn_2014)   To the same effect also is what
he says to Timothy:  “Charging them before the Lord that they strive not
about words to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers.” <span
id="fr_2015"></span>[2016](#fn_2015)   Now this does not mean that, when
adversaries oppose the truth, we are to say nothing in defence of the
truth.  For where, then, would be what he says when he is describing the
sort of man a bishop ought to be:  “that he may be able by sound
doctrine both to exhort and convince the gainsayers?” <span
id="fr_2016"></span>[2017](#fn_2016)   To strive about words is not to
be careful about the way to overcome error by truth, but to be anxious
that your mode of expression should be preferred to that of another. 
The man who does not strive about words, whether he speak quietly,
temperately, or vehemently, uses words with no other purpose than to
make the truth plain, pleasing, and effective; for not even love itself,
which is the end of the commandment and the fulfilling of the law, <span
id="fr_2017"></span>[2018](#fn_2017) can be rightly exercised unless the
objects of love are true and not false.  For as a man with a comely body
but an ill-conditioned mind is a more painful object than if his body
too were deformed, so men who teach lies are the more pitiable if they
happen to be eloquent in speech.  To speak eloquently, then, and wisely
as well, is just to express truths which it is expedient to teach in fit
and proper words,—words which in the subdued style are adequate, in the
temperate, elegant, and in the majestic, forcible.  But the man who
cannot speak both eloquently and wisely should speak wisely without
eloquence, rather than eloquently without wisdom.
