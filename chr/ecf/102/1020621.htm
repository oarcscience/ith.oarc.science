<p class="c34"><a name="iv.XX.19-p1"></A><span class="c2"><a name="iv.XX.19-p1.1"></A>Chapter 19.&#8212;What the Apostle Paul Wrote to the Thessalonians About the Manifestation of Antichrist Which Shall Precede the Day of the Lord.</span></p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="iv.XX.19-p2"></A>I see that I must omit many of the statements of the gospels and epistles about this last judgment, that this volume may not become unduly long; but I can on no account omit what the Apostle Paul says, in writing to the Thessalonians, &#8220;We beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1403"></A><A HREF="#fn_1403"><FONT SIZE="1">1404</FONT></A>
 etc.</p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="iv.XX.19-p4"></A>No one can doubt that he wrote this of Antichrist and of the day of judgment, which he here calls the day of the Lord, nor that he declared that this day should not come unless he first came who is called the apostate &#8212;apostate, to wit, from the Lord God.&#160; And if this may justly be said of all the ungodly, how much more of him?&#160; But it is uncertain in what temple he shall sit, whether in that ruin of the temple which was built by Solomon, or in the Church; for the apostle would not call the temple of any idol or demon the temple of God.&#160; And on this account some think that in this passage Antichrist means not the prince himself alone, but his whole body, that is, the mass of men who adhere to him, along with him their prince; and they also think that we should render the Greek more exactly were we to read, not &#8220;in the temple of God,&#8221; but &#8220;for&#8221; or &#8220;as the temple of God,&#8221; as if he himself were the temple of God, the Church.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1404"></A><A HREF="#fn_1404"><FONT SIZE="1">1405</FONT></A>
&#160; Then as for the words, &#8220;And now ye know what withholdeth,&#8221; <i>i.e</i>., ye know what hindrance or cause of delay there is, &#8220;that he might be revealed in his own time;&#8221; they show that he was unwilling to make an explicit statement, because he said that they knew.&#160; And thus we who have not their knowledge wish and are not able even with pains to understand what the apostle referred to, especially as his meaning is made still more obscure by what he adds.&#160; For what does he mean by &#8220;For the mystery of iniquity doth already work:&#160; only he who now holdeth, let him hold until he be taken out of the way:&#160; and then shall the wicked be revealed?&#8221;&#160; I frankly confess I do not know what he means.&#160; I will nevertheless mention such conjectures as I have heard or read.</p>  <A NAME="page_438"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 438</FONT></A> <a name="iv.XX.19-Page_438"></A>  
<p class="c21"><a name="iv.XX.19-p6"></A>Some think that the Apostle Paul referred to the Roman empire, and that he was unwilling to use language more explicit, lest he should incur the calumnious charge of wishing ill to the empire which it was hoped would be eternal; so that in saying, &#8220;For the mystery of iniquity doth already work,&#8221; he alluded to Nero, whose deeds already seemed to be as the deeds of Antichrist.&#160; And hence some suppose that he shall rise again and be Antichrist.&#160; Others, again, suppose that he is not even dead, but that he was concealed that he might be supposed to have been killed, and that he now lives in concealment in the vigor of that same age which he had reached when he was believed to have perished, and will live until he is revealed in his own time and restored to his kingdom.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1405"></A><A HREF="#fn_1405"><FONT SIZE="1">1406</FONT></A>
&#160; But I wonder that men can be so audacious in their conjectures.&#160; However, it is not absurd to believe that these words of the apostle, &#8220;Only he who now holdeth, let him hold until he be taken out of the way,&#8221; refer to the Roman empire, as if it were said, &#8220;Only he who now reigneth, let him reign until he be taken out of the way.&#8221;&#160; &#8220;And then shall the wicked be revealed:&#8221; no one doubts that this means Antichrist.&#160; But others think that the words, &#8220;Ye know what withholdeth,&#8221; and &#8220;The mystery of iniquity worketh,&#8221; refer only to the wicked and the hypocrites who are in the Church, until they reach a number so great as to furnish Antichrist with a great people, and that this is the <i>mystery</i> of iniquity, because it seems hidden; also that the apostle is exhorting the faithful tenaciously to hold the faith they hold when he says, &#8220;Only he who now holdeth, let him hold until he be taken out of the way,&#8221; that is, until the mystery of iniquity which now is hidden departs from the Church.&#160; For they suppose that it is to this same mystery John alludes when in his epistle he says, &#8220;Little children, it is the last time:&#160; and as ye have heard that Antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.&#160; They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1406"></A><A HREF="#fn_1406"><FONT SIZE="1">1407</FONT></A>
&#160; As therefore there went out from the Church many heretics, whom John calls &#8220;many antichrists,&#8221; at that time prior to the end, and which John calls &#8220;the last time,&#8221; so in the end they shall go out who do not belong to Christ, but to that last Antichrist, and then he shall be revealed.</p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="iv.XX.19-p9"></A>Thus various, then, are the conjectural explanations of the obscure words of the apostle.&#160; That which there is no doubt he said is this, that Christ will not come to judge quick and dead unless Antichrist, His adversary, first come to seduce those who are dead in soul; although their seduction is a result of God&#146;s secret judgment already passed.&#160; For, as it is said &#8220;his presence shall be after the working of Satan, with all power, and signs, and lying wonders, and with all seduction of unrighteousness in them that perish.&#8221;&#160; For then shall Satan be loosed, and by means of that Antichrist shall work with all power in a lying though a wonderful manner.&#160; It is commonly questioned whether these works are called &#8220;signs and lying wonders&#8221; because he is to deceive men&#146;s senses by false appearances, or because the things he does, though they be true prodigies, shall be a lie to those who shall believe that such things could be done only by God, being ignorant of the devil&#146;s power, and especially of such unexampled power as he shall then for the first time put forth.&#160; For when he fell from heaven as fire, and at a stroke swept away from the holy Job his numerous household and his vast flocks, and then as a whirlwind rushed upon and smote the house and killed his children, these were not deceitful appearances, and yet they were the works of Satan to whom God had given this power.&#160; Why they are called signs and lying wonders, we shall then be more likely to know when the time itself arrives.&#160; But whatever be the reason of the name, they shall be such signs and wonders as shall seduce those who shall deserve to be seduced, &#8220;because they received not the love of the truth that they might be saved.&#8221;&#160; Neither did the apostle scruple to go on to say, &#8220;For this cause God shall send upon them the working of error that they should believe a lie.&#8221;&#160; For God shall <i>send</i>, because God shall permit the devil to do these things, the permission being by His own just judgment, though the doing of them is in pursuance of the devil&#146;s unrighteous and malignant purpose, &#8220;that they all might be judged who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.&#8221;&#160; Therefore, being judged, they shall be seduced, and, being seduced, they shall be judged.&#160; But, being judged, they shall be seduced by those secretly just and justly secret judgments of God, with which He has never ceased to judge since the first sin of the rational creatures; and, being seduced, they shall be judged in that last and manifest judgment administered by Jesus Christ, who was Himself most unjustly judged and shall most justly judge.</p>
