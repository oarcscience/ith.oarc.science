<span id="iv.XI.15-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="iv.XI.15-p1.1"></span>Chapter 15.—How We are to Understand the
Words, “The Devil Sinneth from the Beginning.”</span>

<span id="iv.XI.15-p2"></span>As for what John says about the devil,
“The devil sinneth from the beginning” <span
id="fr_478"></span>[479](#fn_478.md) they <span
id="fr_479"></span>[480](#fn_479.md) who suppose it is meant hereby that
the devil was made with a sinful nature, misunderstand it; for if sin be
natural, it is not sin at all.  And how do they answer the prophetic
proofs,—either what Isaiah says when he represents the devil under the
person of the king of Babylon, “How art thou fallen, O Lucifer, son of
the morning!” <span id="fr_480"></span>[481](#fn_480.md) or what Ezekiel
says, “Thou hast been in Eden, the garden of God; every precious stone
was thy covering,” <span id="fr_481"></span>[482](#fn_481.md) where it is
meant that he was some time without sin; for a little after it is still
more explicitly said, “Thou wast perfect in thy ways?”  And if these
passages cannot well be otherwise interpreted, we must understand by
this one also, “He abode not in the truth,” that he was once in the
truth, but did not remain in it.  And from this passage, “The devil
sinneth from the beginning,” it is not to be supposed that he sinned
from the beginning of his created existence, but from the beginning of
his sin, when by his pride he had once commenced to sin.  There is a
passage, too, in the Book of Job, of which the devil is the subject: 
“This is the beginning of the <span id="page_214">p. 214</span> <span
id="iv.XI.15-Page_214"></span> creation of God, which He made to be a
sport to His angels,” <span id="fr_482"></span>[483](#fn_482.md) which
agrees with the psalm, where it is said, “There is that dragon which
Thou hast made to be a sport therein.” <span
id="fr_483"></span>[484](#fn_483.md)   But these passages are not to lead
us to suppose that the devil was originally created to be the sport of
the angels, but that he was doomed to this punishment after his sin. His
beginning, then, is the handiwork of God; for there is no nature, even
among the least, and lowest, and last of the beasts, which was not the
work of Him from whom has proceeded all measure, all form, all order,
without which nothing can be planned or conceived.  How much more, then,
is this angelic nature, which surpasses in dignity all else that He has
made, the handiwork of the Most High!
