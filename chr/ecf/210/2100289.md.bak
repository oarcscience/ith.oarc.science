<span id="iv.vi.ii.ii"></span>

#### <span id="iv.vi.ii.ii-p0.1"></span>Chapter II.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.ii-p1"></span>*The assertion of the Novatians that
they refuse communion only to the lapsed agrees neither with the
teaching of holy Scripture nor with their own. And whereas they allege
as a pretext their reverence for* <span id="page_330">p. 330</span>
<span id="iv.vi.ii.ii-Page_330"></span>*the divine power, they really
are contemning it, inasmuch as it is a sign of low estimation not to use
the whole of a power entrusted to one. But the Church rightly claims the
power of binding and loosing, which heretics have not, inasmuch as she
has received it from the Holy Spirit, against Whom they act
presumptuously.*

<span id="iv.vi.ii.ii-p2"></span>5. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.ii-p2.1"></span>But</span> they say that those should not
be restored to communion who have fallen into denial <span
id="fr_2916"></span>[2917](#fn_2916.md) of the faith. If they made the
crime of sacrilege the only exception to receiving forgiveness, they
would be acting harshly indeed, and, as it would seem, would be in
opposition to the divine utterances only, while consistent with their
own assertions. For when the Lord forgave all sins, He made an exception
of none. But since, as it were after the fashion of the Stoics, they
think that all sins are equal in gravity, and assert that he who has
stolen a common fowl, as they say, no less than he who has smothered his
father, should be for ever excluded from the divine mysteries, how can
they select those guilty of one special offence, since even they
themselves cannot deny that it is most unjust that the penalty of one
should extend to many? <span id="fr_2917"></span>[2918](#fn_2917.md)

<span id="iv.vi.ii.ii-p5"></span>6. They affirm that they are showing
great reverence for God, to Whom alone they reserve the power of
forgiving sins. But in truth none do Him greater injury than they who
choose to prune His commandments and reject the office entrusted to
them. For inasmuch as the Lord Jesus Himself said in the Gospel:
“Receive ye the Holy Spirit: whosesoever sins ye forgive they are
forgiven unto them, and whosesoever sins ye retain, they are
retained,” <span id="fr_2918"></span>[2919](#fn_2918.md) who is it that
honours Him most, he who obeys His bidding or he who rejects it?

<span id="iv.vi.ii.ii-p7"></span>7. The Church holds fast its obedience
on either side, by both retaining and remitting sin; heresy is on the
one side cruel, and on the other disobedient; wishes to bind what it
will not loosen, and will not loosen what it has bound, whereby it
condemns itself by its own sentence. For the Lord willed that the power
of binding and of loosing should be alike, and sanctioned each by a
similar condition. So he who has not the power to loose has not the
power to bind. For as, according to the Lord’s word, he who has the
power to bind has also the power to loose, their teaching destroys
itself, inasmuch as they who deny that they have the power of loosing
ought also to deny that of binding. For how can the one be allowed and
the other disallowed? It is plain and evident that either each is
allowed or each is disallowed in the case of those to whom each has been
given. Each is allowed to the Church, neither to heresy, for this power
has been entrusted to priests alone. Rightly, therefore, does the Church
claim it, which has true priests; heresy, which has not the priests of
God, <span id="fr_2919"></span>[2920](#fn_2919.md) cannot claim it. And by
not claiming this power heresy pronounces its own sentence, that not
possessing priests it cannot claim priestly power. And so in their
shameless obstinacy a shamefaced acknowledgment meets our view.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.ii-p9"></span>8. Consider, too, the point that he who
has received the Holy Ghost has also received the power of forgiving and
of retaining sin. For thus it is written: “Receive the Holy Spirit:
whosesoever sins ye forgive, they are forgiven unto them, and
whosesoever sins ye retain, they are retained.” <span
id="fr_2920"></span>[2921](#fn_2920.md) So, then, he who has not received
power to forgive sins has not received the Holy Spirit. The office of
the priest is a gift of the Holy Spirit, and His right it is specially
to forgive and to retain sins. How, then, can they claim His gift who
distrust His power and His right?

<span id="iv.vi.ii.ii-p11"></span>9. And what is to be said of their
excessive arrogance? For although the Spirit of God is more inclined to
mercy than to severity, their will is opposed to that which He wills,
and they do that which He wills not; whereas it is the office of a judge
to punish, but of mercy to forgive. It would be more endurable,
Novatian, that thou shouldst forgive than that thou shouldst bind. In
the one case thou wouldst assume the right as one who rarely offended;
in the other thou wouldst forgive as one who had fellow-feeling with the
misery of sin.

[Next: Chapter III. To the argument of the Novatians, that they only
deny forgiveness in the case of greater sins, St. Ambrose replies, that
this is also an offence against God, Who gave the power to forgive all
sins, but that of course a more severe penance must follow in case of
graver sins. He points out likewise that this distinction as to the
gravity of sins assigns, as it were, severity to God, Whose mercy in the
Incarnation is overlooked by the Novatians.](2100290.md)
