<span id="iv.vi.ii.xiii"></span>

#### <span id="iv.vi.ii.xiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIII.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xiii-p1"></span>They who have committed a “sin unto
death” are not to be abandoned, but subjected to penance, according to
St. Paul. Explanation of the phrase “Deliver unto Satan.” Satan can
afflict the body, but these afflictions bring spiritual profit, showing
the power of God, Who thus turns Satan’s devices against himself.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xiii-p2"></span>59. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.xiii-p2.1"></span>Lastly</span>, Paul teaches us that we
must not abandon those who have committed a sin unto death, but that we
must rather coerce them with the bread of tears and tears to drink, yet
so that their sorrow itself be moderated. For this is the meaning of the
passage: “Thou hast given them to drink in large measure,” <span
id="fr_3004"></span>[3005](#fn_3004.md) that their sorrow itself should
have its measure, lest perchance he who is doing penance should be
consumed by overmuch sorrow, as was said to the Corinthians: “What will
ye? Shall I come to you with a rod, or in love and a spirit of
meekness?” <span id="fr_3005"></span>[3006](#fn_3005.md) But even the rod
is not severe, since he had read: “Thou shalt beat him indeed with the
rod, but shalt deliver his soul from death.” <span
id="fr_3006"></span>[3007](#fn_3006.md)

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xiii-p6"></span>60. What the Apostle means by the rod
is shown by his invective against fornication, <span
id="fr_3007"></span>[3008](#fn_3007.md) his denunciation of incest, his
reprehension of pride, because they were puffed up who ought rather to
be mourning, and lastly, his sentence on the guilty person, that he
should be excluded from communion, and delivered to the adversary, not
for the destruction of the soul but of the flesh. For as the Lord did
not give power to Satan over the soul of holy Job, but allowed him to
afflict his body, <span id="fr_3008"></span>[3009](#fn_3008.md) so here,
too, the sinner is delivered to Satan for the destruction of the flesh,
that the serpent might lick the dust <span
id="fr_3009"></span>[3010](#fn_3009.md) of his flesh, but not hurt his
soul.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xiii-p10"></span>61. Let, then, our flesh die to
lusts, let it be captive, let it be subdued, and not war against the law
of our mind, but die in subjection to a good service, as in Paul, who
buffeted his body that he might bring it into subjection, in order that
his preaching might become more approved, if the law of his flesh agreed
and was consonant with the law of his flesh. For the flesh dies when its
wisdom passes over into the spirit, so that it no longer has a taste for
the things of the flesh, but for the things of the spirit. Would that I
might see my flesh growing weak, would that I were not dragged captive
into the law of sin, would that I lived not in the flesh, but in the
faith of Christ! And so there is greater grace in the infirmity of the
body than in its soundness.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xiii-p11"></span>62. Having explained Paul’s meaning,
let us now consider the words themselves, in what sense he said that he
had delivered him to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, for the
devil it is who tries us. For he brings ailments on each of our limbs,
and sickness on our whole bodies. And then, too, he smote holy Job with
evil sores from the feet to the head, because he had received the power
of destroying his flesh, when God said: “Behold, I give him up unto
thee, only preserve his life.” <span
id="fr_3010"></span>[3011](#fn_3010.md) This the Apostle took up in the
same words, giving up this man to Satan for the destruction of the
flesh, that his spirit might be saved in the day of our Lord Jesus
Christ. <span id="fr_3011"></span>[3012](#fn_3011.md)

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xiii-p14"></span>63. Great is the power, great is the
gift, which commands the devil to destroy himself. For he destroys
himself when he makes the man whom he is seeking to overthrow by
temptation stronger instead of weak, because whilst he is weakening the
body he is strengthening his soul. For sickness of the body restrains
sin, but luxury sets on fire the sin of the flesh.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xiii-p15"></span>64. The devil is then deceived so as
to wound himself with his own bite, and to arm against himself him whom
he thought to weaken. So he armed holy Job the more <span
id="page_340">p. 340</span> <span
id="iv.vi.ii.xiii-Page_340"></span>after he wounded him, who, with his
whole body covered with sores, endured indeed the bite of the devil, but
felt not his poison. And so it is well said of him, “Thou shalt draw out
the dragon with an hook, thou wilt play with him as with a bird, thou
shalt bind him as a boy doth a sparrow, thou shalt lay thine hand upon
him.” <span id="fr_3012"></span>[3013](#fn_3012.md)

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xiii-p17"></span>65. You see how he is mocked by
Paul, so that, like the child in prophecy, he lays his hand on the hole
of the asp, and the serpent injures him not; he draws him out of his
hiding-places, and makes of his venom a spiritual antidote, so that what
is venom becomes a medicine, the venom serves to the destruction of the
flesh, it becomes medicine to the healing of the spirit. For that which
hurts the body benefits the spirit.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xiii-p18"></span>66. Let, then, the serpent bite the
earthy part of me, let him drive his tooth into my flesh, and bruise my
body; and may the Lord say of me: “I give him up unto thee, only
preserve his life.” How great is the power of Christ, that the
guardianship of man is made a charge even to the devil himself, who
always desires to injure him. Let us then make the Lord Jesus favourable
to ourselves. At the command of Christ the devil himself becomes the
guardian of his prey. Even unwillingly he carries out the commands of
heaven, and, though cruel, obeys the commands of gentleness.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xiii-p19"></span>67. But why do I commend his
obedience? Let him be ever evil that God may be ever good, Who converts
his ill-will into grace for us. He wishes to injure us, but cannot if
Christ resist him. He wounds the flesh but preserves the life. And then
it is written: “Then shall the wolves and the lambs feed together, the
lion and the ox shall eat straw, and they shall not hurt nor destroy in
My holy mountain, saith the Lord.” <span
id="fr_3013"></span>[3014](#fn_3013.md) For this is the sentence of
condemnation on the serpent: “Dust shall be thy food.” <span
id="fr_3014"></span>[3015](#fn_3014.md) What dust? Surely that of which it
is said: “Dust thou art, and into dust shalt thou return.” <span
id="fr_3015"></span>[3016](#fn_3015.md)

[Next: Chapter XIV. St. Ambrose explains that the flesh given to Satan
for destruction is eaten by the serpent when the soul is set free from
carnal desires. He gives, therefore, various rules for guarding the
senses, points out the snares laid for us by means of pleasures, and
exhorts his hearers not to fear the destruction of the flesh by the
serpent.](2100301.md)
