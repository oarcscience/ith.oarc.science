#### <span id="iv.i.ii.xxxvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXVII.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxxvii-p1"></span>An even mind should be preserved in
adversity as well as in prosperity. However, evil things must be
avoided.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxxvii-p2"></span>186. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.ii.xxxvii-p2.1"></span>There</span> is also that true freedom
of the mind from vexation which makes us neither give way too much in
our griefs, nor be too elated in prosperity. <span
id="fr_287"></span>[288](#fn_287.md) And if they who urge men to undertake
the affairs of the state give such rules, how much more <span
id="page_32">p. 32</span> <span id="iv.i.ii.xxxvii-Page_32"></span>ought
we who are called to do duty in the Church, to act thus and do those
things which are pleasing to God, so that Christ’s power may show itself
forth in us. We too must prove ourselves to our Captain, so that our
members may be the weapons of justice; not carnal weapons in which sin
may reign, but weapons strong for God, whereby sin may be destroyed. Let
our flesh die, that in it every sin may die. And as though living again
after death, may we rise to new works and a new life.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxxvii-p4"></span>187. These, then, are the services
of fortitude; and full they are of virtuous and seemly duties. But in
all that we do we must look to see, not only if it is virtuous, but
whether it is possible, so that we may not enter upon anything that we
cannot carry out. <span id="fr_288"></span>[289](#fn_288.md) Wherefore the
Lord, to use His own word, wills us to flee in the time of persecution
from one city to another; <span id="fr_289"></span>[290](#fn_289.md) so
that no one, whilst longing for the crown of martyrdom, may put himself
in the way of dangers which possibly the weak flesh or a mind indulged
could not bear and endure.
