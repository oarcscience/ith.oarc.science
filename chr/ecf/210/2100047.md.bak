#### <span id="iv.i.ii.xxxv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXV.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxxv-p1"></span>On fortitude. This is divided into two
parts: as it concerns matters of war and matters at home. The first
cannot be a virtue unless combined with justice and prudence. The other
depends to a large extent upon endurance.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxxv-p2"></span>175. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.ii.xxxv-p2.1"></span>We</span> have discussed fully enough the
nature and force of what is virtuous from the standpoint of
justice. <span id="fr_260"></span>[261](#fn_260.md) Now let us discuss
fortitude, which (being a loftier virtue than the rest) is divided into
two parts, as it concerns matters of war and matters at home. But the
thought of warlike matters seems to be foreign to the duty of our
office, for we have our thoughts fixed more on the duty of the soul than
on that of the body; nor is it our business to look to arms, but rather
to the affairs of peace. Our fathers, however, as Joshua, the son of
Nun, Jerubbaal, Samson, and David, gained great glory also in war.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxxv-p4"></span>176. Fortitude, therefore, is a
loftier virtue than the rest, but it is also one that never stands
alone. For it never depends on itself alone. Moreover, fortitude without
justice is the source of wickedness. <span
id="fr_261"></span>[262](#fn_261.md) For the stronger it is, the more ready
is it to crush the weaker, whilst in matters of war one ought to see
whether the war is just or unjust.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxxv-p6"></span>177. David never waged war unless he
was driven to it. Thus prudence was combined in him with fortitude in
the battle. For even when about to fight single-handed against Goliath,
the enormous giant, he rejected the armour with which he was
laden. <span id="fr_262"></span>[263](#fn_262.md) His strength depended
more on his own arm than on the weapons of others. Then, at a distance,
to get a stronger throw, with one cast of a stone, he slew his enemy.
After that he never entered on a war without seeking counsel of the
Lord. <span id="fr_263"></span>[264](#fn_263.md) Thus he was victorious in
all wars, and even to his last years was ready to fight. And when war
arose with the Philistines, he joined battle with their fierce troops,
being desirous of winning renown, whilst careless of his own
safety. <span id="fr_264"></span>[265](#fn_264.md)

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxxv-p10"></span>178. But this is not the only kind of
fortitude which is worthy of note. We consider their fortitude glorious,
who, with greatness of mind, “through faith stopped the mouth of lions,
quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of
weakness were made strong.” <span id="fr_265"></span>[266](#fn_265.md) They
did not gain a victory in common with many, surrounded with comrades,
and aided by the legions, but won their triumph alone over their
treacherous foes by the mere courage of their own souls. How
unconquerable was Daniel, who feared not the lions raging round about
him. The beasts roared, whilst he was eating. <span

[Next: Chapter XXXVI. One of the duties of fortitude is to keep the weak
from receiving injury; another, to check the wrong motions of our own
souls; a third, both to disregard humiliations, and to do what is right
with an even mind. All these clearly ought to be fulfilled by all
Christians, and especially by the clergy.](2100048.md)
