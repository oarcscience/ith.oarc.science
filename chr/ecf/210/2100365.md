# <span id="v-p0.1"></span>Note on the Letters of St. Ambrose.

<span id="v-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="v-p1.1"></span>Of</span> the 91 Epistles considered genuine by the
Benedictine Editors, sixty-three are referred by them to fairly certain
dates, <span id="fr_3408"></span>[3409](#fn_3408) and a large number of
these would well be worth translation, throwing as they do so clear a
light on the events of St. Ambrose’s life, and in many cases on the
history of the period. Only a few are here presented to the reader.

<span id="v-p3"></span>Perhaps some others might have been better
selected, but if they were to be so few, it seemed as if these would
give the best general impression of the indomitable energy and fearless
constancy of the great Bishop.

<span id="v-p2"></span> This is really in excess of the number which are
now to be considered as fixed in date.
