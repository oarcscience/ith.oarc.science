#### <span id="iv.ii.iv.xv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XV.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.xv-p1"></span>Though the Spirit be called Lord, three
Lords are not thereby implied; inasmuch as two Lords are not implied by
the fact that the Son in the same manner as the Father is called Lord in
many passages of Scripture; for Lordship exists in the Godhead, and the
Godhead in Lordship, and these coincide without division in the Three
Persons.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.xv-p2"></span>104. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.ii.iv.xv-p2.1"></span>But</span> perhaps, again, you may say: If
I call the Spirit Lord, I shall set forth three Lords. Do you then when
you call the Son Lord either deny the Son or confess two Lords? God
forbid, for the Son Himself said: “Do not serve two lords.” <span
id="fr_1366"></span>[1367](#fn_1366.md) But certainly He denied not either
Himself or the Father to be Lord; for He called the Father Lord, as you
read: “I thank Thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth.” <span
id="fr_1367"></span>[1368](#fn_1367.md) And the Lord spoke of Himself, as
we read in the Gospel: “Ye call Me Master and Lord, and ye do well, for
so I am.” <span id="fr_1368"></span>[1369](#fn_1368.md) But He spoke not of
two Lords; indeed He shows that He did not speak of two Lords, when He
warns them: “Do not serve two lords.” For there are not two Lords where
the Lordship is but one, for the Father is in the Son and the Son in the
Father, and so there is one Lord.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.xv-p6"></span>105. Such, too, was the teaching of the
Law: “Hear, O Israel, the Lord thy God is one Lord,” <span
id="fr_1369"></span>[1370](#fn_1369.md) that is, unchangeable, always
abiding in unity of power, always the same, and not altered by any
accession or diminution. Therefore Moses called Him One, and yet also
relates that the Lord rained down fire from the Lord. <span
id="fr_1370"></span>[1371](#fn_1370.md) The Apostle, too, says: “The Lord
grant unto him to find mercy of the Lord.” <span
id="fr_1371"></span>[1372](#fn_1371.md) The Lord rains down from the Lord;
the Lord grants mercy from the Lord. The Lord is neither divided when He
rains from the Lord, nor is there a separation when He grants mercy from
the Lord, but in each case the oneness of the Lordship is expressed.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.xv-p10"></span>106. In the Psalms, too, you find:
“The Lord said unto my Lord.” <span id="fr_1372"></span>[1373](#fn_1372.md)
And he did not therefore deny that the Father was his Lord, because he
spoke of the Son as his Lord; but therefore called the Son his Lord,
that you might not think Him to be the Son, but the Lord of the prophet,
as the Lord Himself showed in the Gospel, when He said: “If David in the
Spirit called Him Lord, how is he his Son?” <span
id="fr_1373"></span>[1374](#fn_1373.md) David, not the Spirit, calls Him
Lord in the Spirit. Or if they falsely infer from this that the Spirit
called Him Lord, they must necessarily by a like sacrilege seem to
assert that the Son of God is also the Son of the Spirit.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.xv-p13"></span>107. So, as we do not say that there
are two Lords, when we so style both the Father and the Son, so, too, we
do not say that there are three Lords, when we confess the Spirit to be
Lord. For as it is profane to say that there are three Lords or three
Gods, so, too, is it utter profanity to speak of two Lords or two Gods;
for there is one God, one Lord, one Holy Spirit; and He Who is God is
Lord, and He Who is Lord is God, for the Godhead is in the Lordship, and
the Lordship is in the Godhead.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.xv-p14"></span>108. Lastly, you have read that the
Father is both Lord and God: “O Lord my God, I will call upon Thee, hear
Thou me.” <span id="fr_1374"></span>[1375](#fn_1374.md) You find the Son to
be both Lord and God, as you have read in the Gospel, that, when Thomas
had touched the side of Christ, he said, “My Lord and my God.” <span
id="fr_1375"></span>[1376](#fn_1375.md) So in like manner as the Father is
God and the Son Lord, so too the Son is God and the Father Lord. The
holy designation changes from one to the other, the divine nature
changes not, but the dignity remains unchangeable. For they are not \[as
it were\] contributions gathered from bounty, but free-will gifts of
natural love; for both Unity has its special property, and the special
properties are bound together in unity.

[Next: Chapter XVI. The Father is holy, and likewise the Son and the
Spirit, and so They are honoured in the same Trisagion: nor can we speak
more worthily of God than by calling Him Holy; whence it is clear that
we must not derogate from the dignity of the Holy Spirit. In Him is all
which pertains to God, since in baptism He is named with the Father and
the Son, and the Father has given to Him to be greater than all, nor can
any one deprive Him of this. And so from the very passage of St. John
which heretics used against His dignity, the equality of the Trinity and
the Unity of the Godhead is established. Lastly, after explaining how
the Son receives from the Father, St. Ambrose shows how various heresies
are refuted by the passage cited.](2100168.md)
