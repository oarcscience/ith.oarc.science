<span id="iv.iv.v.v"></span>

#### <span id="iv.iv.v.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.

<span id="iv.iv.v.v-p1"></span>Passages brought forward from Scripture
to show that “made” does not always mean the same as “created;” whence
it is concluded that the letter of Holy Writ should not be made the
ground of captious arguments, after the manner of the Jews, who,
however, are shown to be not so bad as the heretics, and thus the
principle already set forth is confirmed anew.

<span id="iv.iv.v.v-p2"></span>35. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.v.v-p2.1"></span>At</span> the same time, becoming <span
id="fr_2165"></span>[2166](#fn_2165.md) does not always imply *creation;*
for we read: “Lord, Thou art become our refuge,” <span
id="fr_2166"></span>[2167](#fn_2166.md) and “Thou hast become my
salvation.” <span id="fr_2167"></span>[2168](#fn_2167.md) Plainly, here is
no statement of the fact or purpose of a *creation*, but God is said to
have become my “refuge” and have turned to my “salvation,” <span
id="fr_2168"></span>[2169](#fn_2168.md) even as the Apostle hath said: “Who
became for us <span id="fr_2169"></span>[2170](#fn_2169.md) Wisdom from
God, and Righteousness, and Sanctification, and Redemption,” <span
id="fr_2170"></span>[2171](#fn_2170.md) that is, that Christ was “made” for
us, of the Father, not *created*. Again, the writer has explained in the
sequel in what sense he says that Christ was made Wisdom for us: “But we
preach the Wisdom of God in doctrine of mystery, which Wisdom is hidden,
foreordained by God before the existence of the world <span
id="fr_2171"></span>[2172](#fn_2171.md) for our glory, and which none of
the princes of this world knew, for had they known they would never have
crucified the Lord of glory.” <span id="fr_2172"></span>[2173](#fn_2172.md)
When the mystery of the Passion is set forth, surely there is no
speaking of an eternal process of generation.

<span id="iv.iv.v.v-p11"></span>36. The Lord’s Cross, then, is my
wisdom; the Lord’s Death my redemption; for we are redeemed with His
precious blood, as the Apostle Peter hath said. <span
id="fr_2173"></span>[2174](#fn_2173.md) With His blood, then, as man, the
Lord redeemed us, Who also, as God, hath forgiven sins. <span
id="fr_2174"></span>[2175](#fn_2174.md)

<span id="iv.iv.v.v-p14"></span><span id="page_248">p. 248</span> <span
id="iv.iv.v.v-Page_248"></span>37. Let us not, therefore, lay snares as
it were in words, and eagerly seek out entanglements therein; let us
not, because misbelievers make out the written word to mean that it
means not, set forth only what this letter bears on the face of it,
instead of the underlying sense. This way went the Jews to destruction,
despising the deep-hidden meaning, and following only after the bare
form of the word, for “the letter killeth, but the Spirit maketh
alive.” <span id="fr_2175"></span>[2176](#fn_2175.md)

<span id="iv.iv.v.v-p16"></span>38. And yet, of these two grievous
impieties, to ascribe to the Godhead what is true only of manhood is
perchance more detestable than to attribute to spirit what belongs only
to letter. The Jews feared to believe in manhood taken up into God, and
therefore have lost the grace of redemption, because they reject that on
which salvation depends; the Arians degrade the majesty of Godhead to
the weakness of humanity. Detestable as are the Jews, who crucified the
Lord’s flesh, more detestable still do I hold them who have believed
that the Godhead of Christ was nailed to the Cross. So one who ofttimes
had dealings with Jews said: “An heretic avoid, after once reproving
him” <span id="fr_2176"></span>[2177](#fn_2176.md)

<span id="iv.iv.v.v-p18"></span>39. Nor, again, are these men careful to
avoid doing dishonour to the Father, in their impious application of the
fact, that Christ was “made” Wisdom for us, to His incomprehensible
generation, that transcends all limits and divisions of time; for,
leaving it out of account that dishonour done to the Son is an insult to
the Father, they do even carry their blasphemy in assault upon the
Father, of Whom it is written: “Let God be made truthful, but every man
a liar.” <span id="fr_2177"></span>[2178](#fn_2177.md) If indeed they think
that the Son is spoken of, they do not foreclose against His
generation, <span id="fr_2178"></span>[2179](#fn_2178.md) but in that they
rest on the authority of this text they do confess that which they
reject, namely, that Christ is God, and true God.

<span id="iv.iv.v.v-p21"></span>40. It would be a lengthy matter were I
to pass in review each several place where we read of His being “made,”
not indeed by nature, but by way of gracious dispensation. Moses, for
example, saith: “Thou art made my Helper and Protector, to save
me;” <span id="fr_2179"></span>[2180](#fn_2179.md) and David: “Be unto me
for a God of salvation, and an house of refuge, that Thou mayest save
me;” <span id="fr_2180"></span>[2181](#fn_2180.md) and Isaiah: “He is
become an Helper for every city that is lowly.” <span
id="fr_2181"></span>[2182](#fn_2181.md) Of a surety the holy men say not to
God: “Thou hast been created,” but “By Thy grace Thou art made a
Protector and Helper unto us.”

<span id="iv.iv.v.v-p3"></span> *i.e.*we are not to infer from the fact
that the Word *became* flesh, that the Word is a created being. For that
which becomes is already existing—that which is created did not exist
before it was made.

The “becoming” is rather in us. It is *we* who have come into being, to
find a refuge and salvation in the Lord.

<span id="iv.iv.v.v-p8"></span> Note that it is Christ *Himself* Who is
our justification, etc., not a certain course of life; in other words
the saving power is not so much in the mere example of Christ’s life on
earth, but primarily and necessarily in Himself, now seated in heaven at
the Father’s right hand, interceding for us, and communicating His
grace, especially through the sacraments.

[Next: Chapter VI. In order to dispose of an objection grounded on a
text in St. John, St. Ambrose first shows that the Arian interpretation
lends countenance to the Manichæans; then, after setting forth the
different ways of dividing the words in this same passage, he shows
plainly that it cannot, without dishonour to the Father, be understood
with such reference to the Godhead as the Arians give it, and expounds
the true meaning thereon.](2100228.md)
