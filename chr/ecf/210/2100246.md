<span id="iv.iv.vi.vi"></span>

#### <span id="iv.iv.vi.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.

<span id="iv.iv.vi.vi-p1"></span>The fourth kind of impossibility (§49)
is now taken into consideration, and it is shown that the Son does
nothing that the Father approves not, there being between Them perfect
unity of will and power.

<span id="iv.iv.vi.vi-p2"></span>64. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.vi.vi-p2.1"></span>The</span> Son, moreover,—to consider now
our fourth premiss,—is not self-assertive, for He, the Divine
Assessor, <span id="fr_2390"></span>[2391](#fn_2390) hath done nought
that is not in agreement with His Father’s Will. Further, the Father
hath seen the things that the Son made, and pronounced them very good;
for so it is written in Genesis: “And God said, Let there be light; and
there was light. And God saw the light that it was good.” <span
id="fr_2391"></span>[2392](#fn_2391)

<span id="iv.iv.vi.vi-p5"></span>65. Now, did the Father say on that
occasion, “Let there be such light as I Myself have made,” or “Let there
be light”—light having as yet not existed; or did the Son ask what sort
of light the Father made? <span id="fr_2392"></span>[2393](#fn_2392)
Nay, the Son made light, according to His own Will, and so far in
accordance with the Father’s good pleasure, that He approved. It is of
new, original work by the Son that the place speaks.

<span id="iv.iv.vi.vi-p7"></span>66. Again, if, as Arian, expositions of
the Scriptures make out, it is a discredit to the Son to have made what
He saw, whereas the Scriptures present Him as having made what He
\[before\] saw not, and to have given being to things which as yet were
not, what should they say of the Father, Who praised that He had seen,
as though He could not have foreseen the things that were to be made?

<span id="iv.iv.vi.vi-p8"></span>67. The Son, therefore, sees the
Father’s work in like manner as the Father sees the Son’s, and the
Father praises not the work as one would praise work of another’s doing,
but recognizes it as His own, for “whatsoever things the Father hath
done, the same doeth the Son, in like manner.” \[So was it written,
that\] you might understand one and the same work to be the work both of
the Father and of the Son. And thus the Son does nothing save what is
approved of by the Father, praised by the Father, willed by the Father,
because His whole Being is of the Father; and He is not as the created
being, which commits many faults, ofttimes offending the Will of its
Creator, in lusting after and falling into sin. Nought, then, is of the
Son’s doing, save what is pleasing to the Father, forasmuch as one Will,
one Purpose, is Theirs, one true Love, one effect of action.

<span id="iv.iv.vi.vi-p9"></span>68. Furthermore, to prove to you that
it comes of Love, that the Son can do nothing of Himself save what He
hath seen the Father doing, the Apostle has added to the words,
“Whatsoever the Father hath done, the same things doeth the Son also, in
like manner,” this reason: “For the Father loveth the Son,” and thus
Scripture refers the Son’s inability to do, whereof it testifies, to
unity in Love that suffers no separation or disagreement.

<span id="iv.iv.vi.vi-p10"></span>69. But if the inseparableness of the
Persons in Love rest, as it truly does, upon \[identity of\] nature,
then surely they are also inseparable, for the same reason, in action,
and it is impossible that the work of the Son should not be in agreement
with the Father’s Will, when what the Son works, the Father works also,
and what the Father works, the Son works also, and what the Son speaks,
the Father speaks also, as it is written: “My Father, Who dwelleth in
Me, He it is that speaketh, and the works that I do He Himself
doeth.” <span id="fr_2393"></span>[2394](#fn_2393) For the Father
appointed nought <span id="page_271">p. 271</span> <span
id="iv.iv.vi.vi-Page_271"></span>save by the exercise of His Power and
Wisdom, forasmuch as He made all things wisely, as it is written: “In
wisdom hast Thou made them all;” <span
id="fr_2394"></span>[2395](#fn_2394) and likewise, God the Word made
nought without the Father’s participation.

<span id="iv.iv.vi.vi-p13"></span>70. Not without the Father does He
work; not without His Father’s Will did He offer Himself for that most
holy Passion, the Victim slain for the salvation of the whole
world; <span id="fr_2395"></span>[2396](#fn_2395) not without His
Father’s Will concurring did He raise the dead to life. For example,
when He was at the point to raise Lazarus to life, He lifted up His eyes
and said, “Father, I thank Thee, for that Thou hast heard Me. And I knew
that Thou dost always hear Me, but for the sake of the multitude that
standeth round I spake, that they may believe that Thou hast sent
Me,” <span id="fr_2396"></span>[2397](#fn_2396) in order that, though
speaking agreeably to His assumed character of man, in the flesh, <span
id="fr_2397"></span>[2398](#fn_2397) He might still express His oneness
with the Father in will and operation, in that the Father hears all and
sees all that the Son wills, and therefore also the Father sees the
Son’s doings, hears the utterances of His Will, for the Son made no
request, and yet said that He had been heard.

<span id="iv.iv.vi.vi-p17"></span>71. Again, we cannot suppose that the
Father hears not all, whatsoever the Son’s will resolves; and to show
that He is always heard by the Father, not as a servant, not as a
prophet, but as Son, He said: “And I knew that Thou dost always hear Me,
but for the sake of the multitude which standeth round I spake, that
they may believe that Thou hast sent Me.”

<span id="iv.iv.vi.vi-p18"></span>72. It is for our sakes, therefore,
that He renders thanks, lest we should suppose that the Father and the
Son are one and the same Person, when we hear of one and the same work
being wrought by the Father and the Son. Further, to show us that His
rendering of thanks had not been the tribute due from one wanting in
power, that, on the contrary, He, as Son of God, ever claimed for
Himself the possession of divine authority, He cried, “Lazarus, come
forth.” Here, surely, is the voice of command, not of prayer.

[Next: Chapter VII. The doctrine had in view for enforcement is
corroborated by the truth that the Son is the Word of the Father--the
Word, not in the sense in which we understand the term, but a living and
active Word. This being so, we cannot deny Him to be of the same Will,
Power, and Substance with the Father.](2100247)
