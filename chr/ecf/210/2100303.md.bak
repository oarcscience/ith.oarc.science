#### <span id="iv.vi.ii.xvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVI.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xvi-p1"></span>Comparison between the apostles and
Novatians. The fitness of the words, “Ye know not what spirit ye are
of,” when applied to them. The desire of penance is extinguished by them
when they take away its fruit. And thus are sinners deprived of the
promises of Christ, though, indeed, they ought not to be too soon
admitted to the mysteries. Some examples of repentance.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xvi-p2"></span>87. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.xvi-p2.1"></span>Inasmuch</span>, then, as the Apostle
forgave sins, by what authority do you say that they are not to be
forgiven? Who has the most reverence for Christ, Paul or Novatian? But
Paul knew that the Lord was merciful. He knew that the Lord Jesus was
offended more by the harshness of the disciples than by their
pitifulness.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xvi-p3"></span>88. Furthermore, Jesus rebuked James
and John when they spoke of bringing down fire from heaven to consume
those who refused to receive the Lord, and said to them: “Ye know not
whose spirit ye are of; for the Son of Man is not come to destroy men’s
lives but to save them.” <span id="fr_3039"></span>[3040](#fn_3039.md) To
them, indeed, He said, “Ye know not whose spirit ye are of,” who were of
His spirit; but to you He says, “Ye are not of My spirit, who hold not
fast My clemency, who reject My mercy, who refuse repentance which I
willed to be preached by the apostles in My Name.”

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xvi-p5"></span>89. For it is in vain that you say
that you preach repentance who remove the fruits of repentance. For men
are led to the pursuit of anything either by rewards or results, and
every pursuit grows slack by delay. And for this reason the Lord, in
order that the devotion of His disciples might be increased, said that
every one who had left all that was his, and followed God, should
receive sevenfold more both here and hereafter. <span
id="fr_3040"></span>[3041](#fn_3040.md) First of all He promised the reward
*here*, to do away with the tedium of delay, and again *hereafter*, that
we might learn to believe that rewards will also be given to us
hereafter. Present rewards are then an earnest of those hereafter.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xvi-p7"></span>90. If, then, any one, having
committed hidden sins, shall nevertheless diligently do penance, how
shall he receive those rewards if not restored to the communion of the
Church? I am willing, indeed, that the guilty man should hope for
pardon, should seek it with tears and groans, should seek it with the
aid of the tears of all the people, should implore forgiveness; and if
communion be postponed two or three times, that he should believe that
his entreaties have not been urgent enough, that he must increase his
tears, must come again even in greater trouble, clasp the feet of the
faithful with his arms, kiss them, wash them with tears, and not let
them go, so that the Lord Jesus may say of him too: “His sins which are
many are forgiven, for he loved much.” <span
id="fr_3041"></span>[3042](#fn_3041.md)

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xvi-p9"></span><span id="page_344">p. 344</span>
<span id="iv.vi.ii.xvi-Page_344"></span>91. I have known penitents whose
countenance was furrowed with tears, their cheeks worn with constant
weeping, who offered their body to be trodden under foot by all, who
with faces ever pale and worn with fasting bore about in a yet living
body the likeness of death.

[Next: Chapter XVII. That gentleness must be added to severity, as is
shown in the case of St. Paul at Corinth. The man had been baptized,
though the Novatians argue against it. And by the word “destruction” is
not meant annihilation but severe chastening.](2100304.md)
