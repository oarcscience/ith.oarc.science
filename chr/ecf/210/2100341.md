<span id="iv.vii.iv.i"></span>

#### <span id="iv.vii.iv.i-p0.1"></span>Chapter I.

<span id="iv.vii.iv.i-p1"></span>St. Ambrose now goes back to the
address of Liberius when he gave the veil to Marcellina. Touching on the
crowds pressing to the bridal feast of that Spouse Who feeds them all,
he passes on to the fitness of her profession on the day on which Christ
was born of a Virgin, and concludes with a fervent exhortation to love
Him.

<span id="iv.vii.iv.i-p2"></span>1. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vii.iv.i-p2.1"></span>Inasmuch</span> as I have digressed in what
I have said in the two former hooks, it is now time, holy sister, to
reconsider those precepts of Liberius <span
id="fr_3254"></span>[3255](#fn_3254.md) of blessed memory which you used to
talk over with me, as the holier the man the more pleasing is his
discourse. For he, when on the Nativity of the Saviour in the Church of
St. Peter you signified your profession of virginity by your change of
attire <span id="fr_3255"></span>[3256](#fn_3255.md) (and what day could be
better than that on which the Virgin received her child?) whilst many
virgins were standing round and vying with each other for your
companionship. “You,” said he, “my daughter, have desired a good
espousal. You see how great a crowd has come together for the birthday
of your Spouse, and none has gone away without food. This is He, Who,
when invited to the marriage feast, changed water into wine. <span
id="fr_3256"></span>[3257](#fn_3256.md) He, too, will confer the pure
sacrament of virginity on you who before were subject to the vile
elements of material nature. This is He Who fed four thousand in the
wilderness with five loaves and two fishes.” <span
id="fr_3257"></span>[3258](#fn_3257.md) He could have fed more; if more had
been there to be fed, they would have been. And now He has called many
to your espousal, but it is not now barley bread, but the Body from
heaven which is supplied.

<span id="iv.vii.iv.i-p7"></span>2. To-day, indeed, He was born after
the manner of men, of a Virgin, but was begotten of the Father before
all things, resembling His mother in body, His Father in power.
Only-begotten on earth, and Only-begotten in heaven. God of God, born of
a Virgin, Righteousness from the Father, Power from the Mighty One,
Light of Light, not unequal to His Father; nor separated in power, not
confused by extension of the Word or enlargement as though mingled with
the Father, but distinguished from the Father by virtue of His
generation. He is your Brother, <span
id="fr_3258"></span>[3259](#fn_3258.md) without Whom neither things in
heaven, nor things in the sea, nor things on earth consist. The good
Word of the Father, Which was, it is said, “in the beginning,” <span
id="fr_3259"></span>[3260](#fn_3259.md) here you have His eternity. “And,”
it is said, “the Word was with God.” <span
id="fr_3260"></span>[3261](#fn_3260.md) Here you have His power, undivided
and inseparable from the Father. “And the Word was God.” <span
id="fr_3261"></span>[3262](#fn_3261.md) Here you have His unbegotten
Godhead, for your faith is to be drawn from the mutual relationship.

<span id="iv.vii.iv.i-p12"></span>3. Love him, my daughter, for He is
good. For, “None is good save God only.” <span
id="fr_3262"></span>[3263](#fn_3262.md) For if there be no doubt that the
Son is God, and that God is good, there is certainly no doubt that God
the Son is good. Love Him I say. He it is Whom the Father begat before
the morning star, <span id="fr_3263"></span>[3264](#fn_3263.md) as being
eternal, He brought Him forth from the womb as the Son; He uttered him
from His heart, <span id="fr_3264"></span>[3265](#fn_3264.md) as the Word.
He it is in Whom the Father is well pleased; <span
id="fr_3265"></span>[3266](#fn_3265.md) He is the Arm of the Father, for He
is Creator of all, and the Wisdom <span
id="fr_3266"></span>[3267](#fn_3266.md) of the Father, for He proceeded
from the mouth of God; <span id="fr_3267"></span>[3268](#fn_3267.md) the
Power of the Father, because the fulness of the Godhead dwelleth in Him
bodily. <span id="fr_3268"></span>[3269](#fn_3268.md) And the Father so
loved Him, as to bear Him in His bosom, and place Him at His right hand,
that you may learn His wisdom, and know His power.

<span id="iv.vii.iv.i-p20"></span>4. If, then, Christ is the Power of
God, was God ever without power? Was the Father ever without the Son? If
the Father of a certainty always was, of a certainty the Son always was.
So He is the perfect Son of a perfect Father. For he who derogates from
the power, derogates from Him Whose is the power. The Perfection of the
Godhead does not admit of inequality. Love, then, Him Whom the Father
loves, honour Him Whom the Father honours, for “he that honoureth not
the Son, honoureth not the Father,” <span
id="fr_3269"></span>[3270](#fn_3269.md) and “whoso denieth the Son, hath
not the Father.” <span id="fr_3270"></span>[3271](#fn_3270.md) So much as
to the faith.

[Next: Chapter II. Touching next upon the training of a virgin, he
speaks of moderation in food and drink, and of restraint upon the
impulses of the mind, introducing some teaching upon the fable of the
death and resurrection of Hippolytus, and advises the avoidance of
certain meats.](2100342.md)
