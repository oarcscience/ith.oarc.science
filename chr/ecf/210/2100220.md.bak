<span id="iv.iv.iv.xvi"></span>

#### <span id="iv.iv.iv.xvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XV.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xvi-p1"></span>St. Ambrose deprecates any praise of
his own merits: in any case, the Faith is sufficiently defended by the
authoritative support of holy Scripture, to whose voice the Arians,
stubborn as the Jews, are deaf. He prays that they may be moved to love
the truth; meanwhile, they are to be avoided, as heretics and enemies of
Christ.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xvi-p2"></span>129. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.iv.xvi-p2.1"></span>These</span> arguments, your Majesty, I
have set forth, briefly and summarily, in the rough, rather than in any
form of full explanation and exact order. If indeed the Arians regard
them as imperfect and unfinished, I indeed confess that they are scarce
even begun; if they think that there be any still to be brought forward,
I allow that there be well-nigh all; for whereas the unbelievers are in
uttermost need of arguments, the faithful have enough and to spare.
Indeed, Peter’s single confession was abundant to warrant faith in
Christ: “Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God;” <span
id="fr_2076"></span>[2077](#fn_2076.md) for it is enough to know His Divine
Generation, without division or diminution, being neither derivation nor
creation. <span id="fr_2077"></span>[2078](#fn_2077.md)

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xvi-p5"></span>130. This, indeed, is declared in the
books of Holy Writ, one and all, and yet is still doubted by
misbelievers: “For,” as it is written, “the heart of this people is
become gross, and with their ears they have been dull of hearing, and
their eyes have they darkened, lest ever they should see with their
eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand in their heart.” <span
id="fr_2078"></span>[2079](#fn_2078.md) For, like the Jews, the Arians’
wont is to stop their ears, or make an uproar, as often as the Word of
salvation is heard.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xvi-p7"></span>131. And what wonder, if unbelievers
doubt the word of man, when they refuse to believe the Word of God? The
Son of God, as you will find it written in the Gospel, said: “Father,
glorify Thy Name,” and from heaven was heard the voice of the Father,
saying: “I have both glorified it, and again will glorify.” <span
id="fr_2079"></span>[2080](#fn_2079.md) These words the unbelievers heard,
but believed not. The Son spake, the Father answered, and the Jews said:
“A peal of thunder answered Him;” others said: “An angel spake to
Him.” <span id="fr_2080"></span>[2081](#fn_2080.md)

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xvi-p10"></span>132. Paul, moreover, as it is written
in the Acts of the Apostles, <span id="fr_2081"></span>[2082](#fn_2081.md)
when by the Voice of Christ he received the call of grace, several
companions journeying with him at the same time, alone said that he had
heard Christ’s Voice. Thus, your sacred Majesty, he who believes,
hears—and he hears, that he may believe, whilst he who believes not,
hears not, nay, he will not, he cannot hear, lest he should believe!

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xvi-p12"></span>133. As for me, indeed, would that
they might have a will to hear, that they might believe—to hear with
true love and meekness, as men seeking what is true, and not assailing
all truth. For it is written that we pay no heed to “endless fables and
genealogies, which do rather raise disputes than set forward the godly
edification, which is in faith. But the aim of the charge is love from a
pure heart, and a good conscience, and faith unfeigned, whence some have
erred and betaken themselves to empty babbling, desirous of being
teachers <span id="page_241">p. 241</span> <span
id="iv.iv.iv.xvi-Page_241"></span>of the law, without understanding the
words they say, nor the things whereof they speak with assurance.” <span
id="fr_2082"></span>[2083](#fn_2082.md) In another place also the same
Apostle saith: “But foolish and ignorant questionings do thou
avoid.” <span id="fr_2083"></span>[2084](#fn_2083.md)

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xvi-p15"></span>134. Such men, who sow disputes—that
is to say, heretics—the Apostle bids us leave alone. Of them he says in
yet another place, that “certain shall depart from the faith, giving
heed to deceitful spirits, and the doctrines of devils.” <span
id="fr_2084"></span>[2085](#fn_2084.md)

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xvi-p17"></span>135. John, likewise, saith that
heretics are Antichrists, <span id="fr_2085"></span>[2086](#fn_2085.md)
plainly marking out the Arians. For this \[Arian\] heresy began to be
after all other heresies, and hath gathered the poisons of all. As it is
written of the Antichrist, that “he opened his mouth to blasphemy
against God, to blaspheme His Name, and to make war with His
saints,” <span id="fr_2086"></span>[2087](#fn_2086.md) so do they also
dishonour the Son of God, and His martyrs have they not spared.
Moreover, that which perchance Antichrist will not do, they have
falsified the holy Scriptures. And thus he who saith that Jesus is not
the Christ, the same is Antichrist; he who denies the Saviour of the
world, denies Jesus; he who denies the Son, denies the Father also, for
it is written; “Every one which denieth the Son, denieth the Father
likewise.” <span id="fr_2087"></span>[2088](#fn_2087.md)

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xvi-p4"></span> “Without division or diminution,”
*i.e.* the generation of the Son entails no division or partition of the
Godhead, still less any diminution of it. The Father is none the less
God. *His* Godhead loses nothing by His begetting His Eternal Son. Some
manuscripts have “*demutatam*” instead of “*deminutam*” here—*i.e.*
“changed” for “diminished.” Certainly the begetting of the Son can make
no change whatever in the Being of the Father, for the Divine Generation
is “from everlasting to everlasting,” and is necessarily implied in the
very Fatherhood, the personal essence of the Father. Hurter quotes St.
Hilary, *De Trin.* 6, 10. “The Church knows of no apportionment made to
the Son, but knows Him as perfect God of perfect God, as One begotten of
One, not shorn off from Him, but born: she knows the Nativity to entail
no diminution of Him Who begets, nor weakness in Him Who is born.” The
fact is a spiritual relation, metaphysical in the highest sense,
transcending our intelligence, and only to be apprehended by faith,
simply as a fact—as the <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iv.iv.xvi-p4.1"></span>ἀρχή</span>, or principle, which is
sufficient for us. The “how” we must wait to have revealed to us
hereafter, if we shall ever be able to receive it.

[Next: Chapter XVI. St. Ambrose assures Gratian of victory, declaring
that it has been foretold in the prophecies of Ezekiel. This hope is
further stayed upon the emperor's piety, the former disasters being the
punishment of Eastern heresy. The book closes with a prayer to God, that
He will now show His mercy, and save the army, the land, and the
sovereign of the faithful.](2100221.md)
