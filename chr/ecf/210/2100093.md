#### <span id="iv.i.iii.xxx-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXX.

<span id="iv.i.iii.xxx-p1"></span>The ending of the book brings an
exhortation to avoid ill-will, and to seek prudence, faith, and the
other virtues.

<span id="iv.i.iii.xxx-p2"></span>152. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.iii.xxx-p2.1"></span>My</span> sons, avoid wicked men, guard
against the envious. There is this difference between a wicked and an
envious man: the wicked man is delighted at his own good fortune, but
the envious is tortured at the <span id="page_67">p. 67</span> <span
id="iv.i.iii.xxx-Page_67"></span>thought of another’s. The former loves
evil, the latter hates good. So he is almost more bearable who desires
good for himself alone, than he who desires evil for all.

<span id="iv.i.iii.xxx-p3"></span>153. My sons, think before you act,
and when you have thought long then do what you consider right. When the
opportunity of a praiseworthy death is given let it be seized at once.
Glory that is put off flies away and is not easily laid hold of again.

<span id="iv.i.iii.xxx-p4"></span>154. Love faith. For by his devotion
and faith Josiah <span id="fr_571"></span>[572](#fn_571) won great love
for himself from his enemies. For he celebrated the Lord’s passover when
he was eighteen years old, as no one had done it before him. As then in
zeal he was superior to those who went before him, so do ye, my sons,
show zeal for God. Let zeal for God search you through, and devour you,
so that each one of you may say: “The zeal of thine house hath eaten me
up. ” <span id="fr_572"></span>[573](#fn_572) An apostle of Christ was
called the zealot. <span id="fr_573"></span>[574](#fn_573) But why do I
speak of an apostle? The Lord Himself said: “The zeal of thine house
hath eaten Me up.” <span id="fr_574"></span>[575](#fn_574) Let it then
be real zeal for God, not mean earthy zeal, for that causes jealousy.

<span id="iv.i.iii.xxx-p9"></span>155. Let there be peace among you,
which passeth all understanding. Love one another. Nothing is sweeter
than charity, nothing more blessed than peace. Ye yourselves know that I
have ever loved you and do now love you above all others. As the
children of one father ye have become united under the bond of brotherly
affection.

<span id="iv.i.iii.xxx-p10"></span>156. Whatsoever is good, that hold
fast; and the God of peace and love be with you in the Lord Jesus, to
Whom be honour and glory, dominion and might, together with the Holy
Spirit, for ever and ever. Amen.
