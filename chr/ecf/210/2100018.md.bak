#### <span id="iv.i.ii.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.

<span id="iv.i.ii.vi-p1"></span>In this matter we must imitate David’s
silence and humility, so as not even to seem deserving of harm.

<span id="iv.i.ii.vi-p2"></span>21. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.ii.vi-p2.1"></span>What</span> need is there to be troubled
when we hear abuse? Why do we not imitate him who says: “I was dumb and
humbled myself, and kept silence even from good words”? <span
id="fr_54"></span>[55](#fn_54.md) Or did David only say this, and not act
up to it? No, he also acted up to it. For when Shimei the son of Gera
reviled him, David was silent; and although he was surrounded with armed
men he did not return the abuse, nor sought revenge: nay, even when the
son of Zeruiah spoke to him, because he wished to take vengeance on him,
David did not permit it. <span id="fr_55"></span>[56](#fn_55.md) He went on
as though dumb, and humbled; he went on in silence; nor was he
disturbed, although called a bloody man, for he was conscious of his own
gentleness. He therefore was not disturbed by insults, for he had full
knowledge of his own good works.

<span id="iv.i.ii.vi-p5"></span>22. He, then, who is quickly roused by
wrong makes himself seem deserving of insult, even whilst he wishes to
be shown not to deserve it. He who despises wrongs is better off than he
who grieves over them. For he who despises them looks down on them, as
though he feels them not; but he who grieves over them is tormented,
just as though he actually felt them.

[Next: Chapter VII. How admirably Ps. xxxix. \[xxxviii.\] takes the
place of an introduction. Incited thereto by this psalm the saint
determines to write on duties. He does this with more reason even than
Cicero, who wrote on this subject to his son. How, further, this is
so.](2100019.md)
