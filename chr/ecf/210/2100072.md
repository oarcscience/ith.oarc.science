#### <span id="iv.i.iii.ix-p0.1"></span>Chapter IX.

<span id="iv.i.iii.ix-p1"></span>Though justice and prudence are
inseparable, we must have respect to the ideas of people in general, for
they make a distinction between the different cardinal virtues.

<span id="iv.i.iii.ix-p2"></span>48. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.iii.ix-p2.1"></span>It</span> is clear also, according to the
sacred Scriptures, which are the older, that wisdom cannot exist without
justice, for where one of these two is, there the other must be also.
With what wisdom did Daniel expose the lie in the false accusation
brought against him by his thorough examination, so that those false
informers had no answer ready to hand! <span
id="fr_453"></span>[454](#fn_453.md) It was a mark of prudence to convict
the criminals by the witness of their own words, and a sign of justice
to give over the guilty to punishment, and to save the innocent from it.

<span id="iv.i.iii.ix-p4"></span>49. There is therefore an inseparable
union between wisdom and justice; but, generally speaking, <span
id="fr_454"></span>[455](#fn_454.md) the one special form of virtue is
divided up. Thus temperance lies in despising pleasures, fortitude may
be seen in undergoing labours and dangers, prudence in the choice of
what is good, by knowing how to distinguish between things useful and
the reverse; justice, in being a good guardian of another’s rights and
protector of its own, thus maintaining for each his own. We can make
this fourfold division in deference to commonly received ideas; and so,
whilst deviating from those subtle discussions of philosophic learning
which are brought forth as though from some inner recess for the sake of
investigating the truth, can follow the commonly received use and their
ordinary meaning. Keeping, then, to this division, let us return to our
subject.

[Next: Chapter X. Men entrust their safety rather to a just than to a
prudent man. But every one is wont to seek out the man who combines in
himself the qualities of justice and prudence. Solomon gives us an
example of this. (The words which the queen of Sheba spoke of him are
explained.) Also Daniel and Joseph.](2100073.md)
