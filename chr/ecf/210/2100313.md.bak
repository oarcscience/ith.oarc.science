#### <span id="iv.vi.iii.viii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VIII.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.viii-p1"></span>In urging repentance St. Ambrose
turns to his own case, expressing the wish that he could wash our Lord’s
feet like the woman in the Gospel, which is a great pattern of
penitence, though such as cannot attain to it find acceptance. He prays
for himself, especially that he may sorrow with sinners, who are better
than himself. Those for whom Christ died are not to be contemned.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.viii-p2"></span>66. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.iii.viii-p2.1"></span>Show</span>, then, your wound to the
Physician that He may heal it. Though you show it not, He knows it, but
waits to hear your voice. Do away your scars by tears. Thus did that
woman in the Gospel, and wiped out the stench of her sin; thus did she
<span id="page_354">p. 354</span> <span
id="iv.vi.iii.viii-Page_354"></span>wash away her fault, when washing
the feet of Jesus with her tears.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.viii-p3"></span>67. Would that Thou, Lord Jesus,
mightest reserve for me the washing off from Thy feet of the stains
contracted since Thou walkest in me! O that Thou mightest offer to me to
cleanse the pollution which I by my deeds have caused on Thy steps! But
whence can I obtain living water, wherewith I may wash Thy feet? If I
have no water I have tears, and whilst with them I wash Thy feet I trust
to cleanse myself. Whence is it that Thou shouldst say to me: “His sins
which are many are forgiven, because he loved much”? I confess that I
owe more, and that more has been forgiven me who have been called to the
priesthood from the tumult and strife of the law courts and the dread of
public administration; and therefore I fear that I may be found
ungrateful, if I, to whom more has been forgiven, love less.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.viii-p4"></span>68. But all are not able to equal
that woman, who was deservedly preferred even to Simon, who was giving
the feast to the Lord; who gave a lesson to all who desire to gain
forgiveness, by kissing the feet of Christ, washing them with her tears,
wiping them with her hair, and anointing them with ointment.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.viii-p5"></span>69. In a kiss is the sign of love,
and therefore the Lord Jesus says: “Let her kiss Me with the kisses of
her mouth.” <span id="fr_3127"></span>[3128](#fn_3127.md) What is the
meaning of the hair, but that you may learn that, having laid aside all
the pomp of worldly trappings, you must implore pardon, throw yourself
on the earth with tears, and prostrate on the ground move pity. In the
ointment, too, is set forth the savour of a good conversation. David was
a king, yet he said: “Every night will I wash my bed, I will water my
couch with tears.” <span id="fr_3128"></span>[3129](#fn_3128.md) And
therefore he obtained such a favour, as that of his house the Virgin
should be chosen, who by her child-bearing should bring forth Christ for
us. Therefore is this woman also praised in the Gospel.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.viii-p8"></span>70. Nevertheless if we are unable to
equal her, the Lord Jesus knows also how to aid the weak, when there is
no one who can prepare the feast, or bring the ointment, or carry with
her a spring of living water. He comes Himself to the sepulchre.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.viii-p9"></span>71. Would that Thou wouldst
vouchsafe to come to this sepulchre of mine, O Lord Jesus, that Thou
wouldst wash me with Thy tears, since in my hardened eyes I possess not
such tears as to be able to wash away my offence. If Thou shalt weep for
me I shall be saved; if I am worthy of Thy tears I shall cleanse the
stench of all my offences; if I am worthy that Thou weep but a little,
Thou wilt call me out of the tomb of this body and will say: “Come
forth,” that my meditations may not be kept pent up in the narrow limits
of this body, but may go forth to Christ, and move in the light, that I
may think no more on works of darkness but on works of light. For he who
thinks on sins endeavours to shut himself up within his own
consciousness.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.viii-p10"></span>72. Call forth, then, Thy servant.
Although bound with the chain of my sins I have my feet fastened and my
hands tied; being now buried in dead thoughts and works, yet at Thy call
I shall go forth free, and shall be found one of those sitting at Thy
feast, and Thy house shall be filled with precious ointment. If Thou
hast vouchsafed to redeem any one, Thou wilt preserve him. For it shall
be said, “See, he was not brought up in the bosom of the Church, nor
trained from childhood, but hurried from the judgment-seat, brought away
from the vanities of this world, growing accustomed to the singing of
the choir instead of the shout of the crier, but he continues in the
priesthood not by his own strength, but by the grace of Christ, and sits
among the guests at the heavenly table.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.viii-p11"></span>73. Preserve, O Lord, Thy work,
guard the gift which Thou hast given even to him who shrank from it. For
I knew that I was not worthy to be called a bishop, because I had
devoted myself to this world, but by Thy grace I am what I am. And I am
indeed the least of all bishops, and the lowest in merit; yet since I
too have undertaken some labour for Thy holy Church, watch over this
fruit, and let not him whom when lost Thou didst call to the priesthood,
to be lost when a priest. And first grant that I may know how with
inmost affection to mourn with those who sin; for this is a very great
virtue, since it is written: “And thou shalt not rejoice over the
children of Judah in the day of their destruction, and speak not proudly
in the day of their trouble.” <span id="fr_3129"></span>[3130](#fn_3129.md)
Grant that so often as the sin of any one who has fallen is made known
to me I may suffer with him, and not chide him proudly, but mourn and
weep, so that weeping over another I may mourn for myself, saying,
“Tamar hath been more righteous than I.” <span
id="fr_3130"></span>[3131](#fn_3130.md)

<span id="iv.vi.iii.viii-p14"></span>74. Perchance a maiden may have
fallen, deceived and hurried away by those occa<span id="page_355">p.
355</span> <span id="iv.vi.iii.viii-Page_355"></span>sions which are the
sources of sins. Well, we who are older sin, too. In us, too, the law of
this flesh wars against the law of our mind, and makes us captives of
sin, so that we do what we would not. <span
id="fr_3131"></span>[3132](#fn_3131.md) Her youth is an excuse for her, I
now have none, for she ought to learn, we ought to teach. So that “Tamar
hath been more righteous than I.”

<span id="iv.vi.iii.viii-p16"></span>75. We inveigh against some one’s
covetousness, let us call to mind whether we ourselves have never done
anything covetously; and if we have, since covetousness is the root of
all evils, and is working in our bodies like a serpent secretly under
the earth, let each of us say: “Tamar hath been more righteous than I.”

<span id="iv.vi.iii.viii-p17"></span>76. If we have been seriously moved
against any one, a layman may act hastily for a smaller matter than a
bishop. Let us ponder that with ourselves and say, He who is reproved
for quick temper is more righteous than I. For if we thus speak, we
guard ourselves against this, that the Lord Jesus or one of His
disciples should say to us: “Thou beholdest the mote in thy brother’s
eye, but beholdest not the beam which is in thine own eye. Thou
hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt
thou see to cast out the mote out of thy brother’s eye.” <span
id="fr_3132"></span>[3133](#fn_3132.md)

<span id="iv.vi.iii.viii-p19"></span>77. Let us, then, not be ashamed to
say that our fault is more serious than that of him whom we think we
must reprove, for this is what Judah did who reprimanded Tamar, and
remembering his own fault said: “Tamar is more righteous than I.” In
which saying there is a deep mystery and a moral precept; and therefore
is his offence not reckoned to him, because he accused himself before he
was accused by others.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.viii-p20"></span>78. Let us, then, not rejoice over
the sin of any one, but rather let us mourn, for it is written: “Rejoice
not against me, O my enemy, because I have fallen, for I shall arise;
for if I sit in darkness the Lord shall be a light unto me, I will bear
the indignation of the Lord, because I have sinned against Him, until He
maintain my cause, and execute judgment for me, and bring me forth to
the light, and I shall behold His righteousness. Mine enemy, too, shall
see it and shall be covered with confusion, which said unto me, Where is
the Lord thy God? Mine eyes shall behold her, and she shall be for
treading down as the mire in the streets.” <span
id="fr_3133"></span>[3134](#fn_3133.md) And this not unreservedly, for he
who rejoices at the fall of another rejoices at the victory of the
devil. Let us, then, rather mourn when we hear that one has perished for
whom Christ died, Who despises not even the straw in time of harvest.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.viii-p22"></span>79. O that He may not cast away
this straw at His harvest, the empty stalks of my produce; but may He
gather it in, as is said by some one: “Woe is me, for I am become as one
that gathereth straw in harvest, and grape gleanings in the
vintage,” <span id="fr_3134"></span>[3135](#fn_3134.md) that He may eat of
the firstfruits at least of His grace in me, though He approve not the
later fruit.

[Next: Chapter IX. In what way faith is necessary for repentance. Means
for paying our debts, in which work, prayer, tears, and fasting are of
more value than money. Some instances are adduced, and St. Ambrose
declares that generosity is profitable, but only when joined with faith;
it is, moreover, liable to certain defects. He goes on to speak of some
defects in repentance, such as too great haste in seeking
reconciliation, considering abstinence from sacraments all that is
needed, of committing sin in hope of repenting later.](2100314.md)
