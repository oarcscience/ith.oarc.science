#### <span id="iv.i.iv.xvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVI.

<span id="iv.i.iv.xvi-p1"></span>After saying a few words about Tobit he
demonstrates that Raguel surpassed the philosophers in virtue.

<span id="iv.i.iv.xvi-p2"></span>96. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.iv.xvi-p2.1"></span>Tobit</span> also clearly portrayed in his
life true virtue, when he left the feast and buried the dead, <span
id="fr_707"></span>[708](#fn_707) and invited the needy to the meals at
his own poor table. And Raguel is a still brighter example. For he, in
his regard for virtue, when asked to give his daughter in marriage, was
not silent regarding his daughter’s faults, for fear of seeming to get
the better of the suitor by silence. So when Tobit the son of Tobias
asked that his daughter might be given him, he answered that, according
to the law, she ought to be given him as near of kin, but that he had
already given her to six men, and all of them were dead. <span
id="fr_708"></span>[709](#fn_708) This just man, then, feared more for
others than for himself, and wished rather that his daughter should
remain unmarried than that others should run risks in consequence of
their union with her.

<span id="iv.i.iv.xvi-p5"></span>97. How simply he settled all the
questions of the philosophers! They talk about the defects of a house,
whether they ought to be concealed or made known by the vendor. <span
id="fr_709"></span>[710](#fn_709) Raguel was quite certain that his
daughter’s faults ought not to be kept secret. And, indeed, he had not
been eager to give her up—he was asked for her. We can have no doubt how
much more nobly he acted than those philosophers, when we consider how
much more important a daughter’s future is than some mere money affair.
