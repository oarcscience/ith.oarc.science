<span id="iv.iv.iv.vi"></span>

#### <span id="iv.iv.iv.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.vi-p1"></span>Certain passages from Scripture, urged
against the Omnipotence of Christ, are resolved; the writer is also at
especial pains to show that Christ not seldom spoke in accordance with
the affections of human nature.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.vi-p2"></span>39. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.iv.vi-p2.1"></span>Although</span> it is written concerning
God, “Blessed and only Potentate,” <span
id="fr_1947"></span>[1948](#fn_1947.md) yet I have no misgiving that the
Son of God is thereby severed from Him, seeing that the Scripture
entitled God, not the Father by Himself, the “only Potentate.” The
Father Himself also declares by the prophet, concerning Christ, that “I
have set help upon one that is mighty.” <span
id="fr_1948"></span>[1949](#fn_1948.md) It is not the Father alone, then,
Who is the only Potentate; God the Son also is Potentate, for in the
Father’s praise the Son is praised too.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.vi-p5"></span>40. Aye, let some one show what there
is that the Son of God cannot do. Who was His helper, when He made the
heavens,—Who, when He laid the foundations of the world? <span
id="fr_1949"></span>[1950](#fn_1949.md) Had He any need of a helper to set
men free, Who needed none in constituting <span
id="fr_1950"></span>[1951](#fn_1950.md) angels and principalities? <span
id="fr_1951"></span>[1952](#fn_1951.md)

<span id="iv.iv.iv.vi-p9"></span>41. “It is written,” say they: “‘My
Father, if it be possible, take away this cup from Me.’ <span
id="fr_1952"></span>[1953](#fn_1952.md) If, then, He is Almighty, how comes
He to doubt of the possibility?” Which means that, because I have proved
Him to be Almighty, I have proved Him unable to doubt of possibility.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.vi-p11"></span>42. The words, you say, are the words
of Christ. True—consider, though, the occasion of His speaking them, and
in what character He speaks. He hath taken upon Him the substance of
man, <span id="fr_1953"></span>[1954](#fn_1953.md) and therewith its
affections. Again, you find in the place above cited, that “He went
forward a little further, and fell on His face, praying, and saying:
Father, if it be possible.” <span id="fr_1954"></span>[1955](#fn_1954.md)
Not as God, then, but as man, speaketh He, for could God be ignorant of
the possibility or impossibility of aught? Or is anything impossible for
God, when the Scripture saith: “For Thee nothing is impossible”? <span
id="fr_1955"></span>[1956](#fn_1955.md)

<span id="iv.iv.iv.vi-p15"></span>43. Of Whom, howbeit, does He doubt—of
Himself, or of the Father? Of Him, surely, Who saith: “Take away from
Me,”—being moved as man is moved to doubt. The prophet reckons nothing
impossible with God. The prophet doubts not; think you that the Son
doubts? Wilt thou put God lower than man? What—God hath doubts of His
Father, and is fearful at the thought of death! Christ, then, is
afraid—afraid, whilst Peter fears nothing. Peter saith: <span
id="page_229">p. 229</span> <span id="iv.iv.iv.vi-Page_229"></span>“I
will lay down my life for Thy sake.” <span
id="fr_1956"></span>[1957](#fn_1956.md) Christ saith: “My soul is
troubled.” <span id="fr_1957"></span>[1958](#fn_1957.md)

<span id="iv.iv.iv.vi-p18"></span>44. Both records are true, and it is
equally natural that the person who is the less should not fear, as that
He Who is the greater should endure this feeling, for the one has all a
man’s ignorance of the might of death, whilst the other, as being God
inhabiting a body, displays the weakness of the flesh, that the
wickedness of those who deny the mystery of the Incarnation might have
no excuse. Thus, then, hath He spoken, yet the Manichæan believed
not; <span id="fr_1958"></span>[1959](#fn_1958.md) Valentinus denied, and
Marcion judged Him to be a ghost.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.vi-p20"></span>45. But indeed He so far put Himself
on a level with man, such as He showed Himself to be in the reality of
His bodily frame, as to say, “Nevertheless, not as I will, but as Thou
wilt,” <span id="fr_1959"></span>[1960](#fn_1959.md) though truly it is
Christ’s especial power to will what the Father wills, even as it is His
to do what the Father doeth.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.vi-p22"></span>46. Here, then, let there be an end of
the objection which it is your custom to oppose to us, on the ground
that the Lord said, “Not as I will, but as Thou wilt;” and again, “For
this cause I came down from heaven, not to do My own will, but the will
of Him that sent Me.” <span id="fr_1960"></span>[1961](#fn_1960.md)

<span id="iv.iv.iv.vi-p19"></span> The principle common to these and
other like heretics (who ignored or misconstrued many passages of
Scripture which plainly declare the completeness and truth of our Lord’s
humanity) was that matter is inherently and by its very nature evil.
Mani, therefore, and the rest were easily led to think shame of
attributing to Christ a real, tangible, visible body. For the doctrines
of Mani, see note on I. 57. Valentinus was a Gnostic, who lived at Rome
(whither he came from Alexandria) between 140 and 160 <span

became known as a heresiarch in the papacy of Eleutherius (177–190 <span

doctrines of Valentinus and Marcion, see Robertson’s *Church History,*

[Next: Chapter VI. The passages of Scripture above cited are taken as an
occasion for a digression, wherein our Lord's freedom of action is
proved from the ascription to the Spirit of such freedom, and from
places where it is attributed to the Son.](2100211.md)
