<span id="iv.i.iii.xxviii"></span>

#### <span id="iv.i.iii.xxviii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXVIII.

<span id="iv.i.iii.xxviii-p1"></span>Mercy must be freely shown even
though it brings an odium of its own. With regard to this, reference is
made to the well-known story about the sacred vessels which were broken
up by Ambrose to pay for the redemption of captives; and very beautiful
advice is given about the right use of the gold and silver which the
Church possesses. Next, after showing from the action of holy Lawrence
what are the true treasures of the Church, certain rules are laid down
which ought to be observed in melting down and employing for such uses
the consecrated vessels of the Church.

<span id="iv.i.iii.xxviii-p2"></span>136. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.iii.xxviii-p2.1"></span>It</span> is a very great incentive to
mercy to share in others’ misfortunes, to help the needs of others as
far as our means allow, and sometimes even beyond them. For it is better
for mercy’s sake to take up a case, or to suffer odium rather than to
show hard feeling. So I once brought odium on myself because I broke up
the sacred vessels to redeem captives—a fact that could displease the
Arians. Not that it displeased them as an act, but as being a thing in
which they could take hold of something for which to blame me. Who can
be so hard, cruel, iron-hearted, as to be displeased because a man is
redeemed from death, or a woman from barbarian impurities, things that
are worse than death, or boys and girls and infants from the pollution
of idols, whereby through fear of death they were defiled?

<span id="iv.i.iii.xxviii-p3"></span>137. Although we did not act thus
without good reason, yet we have followed it up among the people so as
to confess and to add again and again that it was far better to preserve
souls than gold for the Lord. For He Who sent the apostles without
gold <span id="fr_563"></span>[564](#fn_563.md) also brought together the
churches without gold. The Church has gold, not to store up, but to lay
out, and to spend on those who need. What necessity is there to guard
what is of no good? Do we not know how much gold and silver the
Assyrians took out of the temple of the Lord? <span
id="fr_564"></span>[565](#fn_564.md) Is it not much better that the priests
should melt it down for the sustenance of the poor, if other supplies
fail, than that a sacrilegious enemy should carry it off and defile it?
Would not the Lord Himself say: Why didst thou suffer so many needy to
die of hunger? Surely thou hadst gold? Thou shouldst have given them
sustenance. Why are so many captives brought on the slave market, and
why are so many unredeemed left to be slain by the enemy? It had been
better to preserve living vessels than gold ones.

<span id="iv.i.iii.xxviii-p6"></span>138. To this no answer could be
given. For what wouldst thou say: I feared that the temple of God would
need its ornaments? He would answer: The sacraments need not gold, nor
are they proper to gold only—for they are not bought with gold. The
glory of the sacraments is the redemption of captives. Truly they are
precious vessels, for they redeem men from death. That, indeed, is the
true treasure of the Lord which effects what His blood effected. Then,
indeed, is the vessel of the Lord’s blood recognized, when one sees in
either redemption, so that the chalice redeems from the enemy those whom
His blood redeemed from sin. <span id="page_65">p. 65</span> <span
id="iv.i.iii.xxviii-Page_65"></span>How beautifully it is said, when
long lines of captives are redeemed by the Church: These Christ has
redeemed. Behold the gold that can be tried, behold the useful gold,
behold the gold of Christ which frees from death, behold the gold
whereby modesty is redeemed and chastity is preserved.

<span id="iv.i.iii.xxviii-p7"></span>139. These, then, I preferred to
hand over to you as free men, rather than to store up the gold. This
crowd of captives, this company surely is more glorious than the sight
of cups. The gold of the Redeemer ought to contribute to this work so as
to redeem those in danger. I recognize the fact that the blood of Christ
not only glows in cups of gold, but also by the office of redemption has
impressed upon them the power of the divine operation.

<span id="iv.i.iii.xxviii-p8"></span>140. Such gold the holy martyr
Lawrence preserved for the Lord. For when the treasures of the Church
were demanded from him, he promised that he would show them. On the
following day he brought the poor together. When asked where the
treasures were which he had promised, he pointed to the poor, saying:
“These are the treasures of the Church.” And truly they were treasures,
in whom Christ lives, in whom there is faith in Him. So, too, the
Apostle says: “We have this treasure in earthen vessels.” <span
id="fr_565"></span>[566](#fn_565.md) What greater treasures has Christ than
those in whom He says He Himself lives? For thus it is written: “I was
hungry and ye gave Me to eat, I was thirsty and ye gave Me to drink, I
was a stranger and ye took Me in.” <span
id="fr_566"></span>[567](#fn_566.md) And again: “What thou didst to one of
these, thou didst it unto Me.” <span id="fr_567"></span>[568](#fn_567.md)
What better treasures has Jesus than those in which He loves to be seen?

<span id="iv.i.iii.xxviii-p12"></span>141. These treasures Lawrence
pointed out, and prevailed, for the persecutors could not take them
away. Jehoiachim, <span id="fr_568"></span>[569](#fn_568.md) who preserved
his gold during the siege and spent it not in providing food, saw his
gold carried off, and himself led into captivity. Lawrence, who
preferred to spend the gold of the Church on the poor, rather than to
keep it in hand for the persecutor, received the sacred crown of
martyrdom for the unique and deep-sighted vigour of his meaning. Or was
it perhaps said to holy Lawrence: “Thou shouldst not spend the treasures
of the Church, or sell the sacred vessels”?

<span id="iv.i.iii.xxviii-p14"></span>142. It is necessary that every
one should fill this office, with genuine good faith and clear-sighted
forethought. If any one derives profit from it for himself it is a
crime, but if he spends the treasures on the poor, or redeems captives,
he shows mercy. For no one can say: Why does the poor man live? None can
complain that captives are redeemed, none can find fault because a
temple of the Lord is built, none can be angry because a plot of ground
has been enlarged for the burial of the bodies of the faithful, none can
be vexed because in the tombs of the Christians there is rest for the
dead. In these three ways it is allowable to break up, melt down, or
sell even the sacred vessels of the Church.

<span id="iv.i.iii.xxviii-p15"></span>143. It is necessary to see that
the mystic cup does not go out of the Church, lest the service of the
sacred chalice should be turned over to base uses. Therefore vessels
were first sought for in the Church which had not been consecrated to
such holy uses. Then broken up and afterwards melted down, they were
given to the poor in small payments, and were also used for the ransom
of captives. But if new vessels fail, or those which never seem to have
been used for such a holy purpose, then, as I have already said, I think
that all might be put to this use without irreverence.

[Next: Chapter XXIX. The property of widows or of all the faithful, that
has been entrusted to the Church, ought to be defended though it brings
danger to oneself. This is illustrated by the example of Onias the
priest, and of Ambrose, bishop of Ticinum.](2100092.md)
