#### <span id="iv.vi.ii.ix-p0.1"></span>Chapter IX.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.ix-p1"></span>*By collating similar passages with*
<span id="iv.vi.ii.ix-p1.1"></span>*[1 Sam. iii.
25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#025.md)<span id="iv.vi.ii.ix-p1.2"></span>,
St. Ambrose shows that the meaning is not that no one shall intercede,
but that the intercessor must be worthy as were Moses and Jeremiah, at
whose prayers we read that God spared Israel.*

<span id="iv.vi.ii.ix-p2"></span>40. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.ix-p2.1"></span>But</span> you say, It is written: “If a
man sin against the Lord, who shall entreat for him?” <span
id="fr_2967"></span>[2968](#fn_2967.md) First of all, as I already said
before, I might allow you to make that objection if you refused penance
to those only who denied the faith. But what difficulty does that
question produce? For it is not written, “No one shall entreat for him;”
but, “Who shall entreat?” that is to say, the question is, Who in such a
case can entreat? The entreaty is not excluded.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.ix-p4"></span>41. Then you have in the fifteenth
Psalm: “Lord, who shall dwell in Thy tabernacle, or who shall rest upon
Thy holy hill?” <span id="fr_2968"></span>[2969](#fn_2968.md) It is not
that no one, but that he who is approved shall dwell there, nor does it
say that no one shall rest, but he who is chosen shall rest. And that
you may know that this is true, it is said not much later in the
twenty-fourth Psalm: “Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord, or who
shall stand in His holy place?” <span
id="fr_2969"></span>[2970](#fn_2969.md) The writer implies, not any
ordinary person, or one of the common sort, but only a man of excellent
life and of singular merit. And that we may understand that when the
question is asked, Who? it does not imply no one, but some special one
is meant, after having said “Who shall ascend into the hill of the
Lord?” the Psalmist adds: “He that hath clean hands and a pure heart,
who hath not lift up his mind unto vanity.” <span
id="fr_2970"></span>[2971](#fn_2970.md) And elsewhere it is said: “Who is
wise and he shall understand these things?” <span
id="fr_2971"></span>[2972](#fn_2971.md) And in the Gospel: “Who is the
faithful and wise steward, whom the Lord shall set over His household to
give them their measure of wheat in due season?” <span
id="fr_2972"></span>[2973](#fn_2972.md) And that we may understand that He
speaks of such as really exist, the Lord added: “Blessed is that
servant, whom his Lord when He cometh shall find so doing.” <span
id="fr_2973"></span>[2974](#fn_2973.md) And I am of opinion that where it
is said, “Lord, who is like unto Thee?” <span
id="fr_2974"></span>[2975](#fn_2974.md) it is not meant that none is like,
for the Son is the image of the Father.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.ix-p12"></span>42. We must then understand in the
same manner, “Who shall entreat for him?” as implying: It must be some
one of excellent life who shall entreat for him who has sinned against
the Lord. The greater the sin, the more worthy must be the prayers that
are sought. For it was not any one of the common people who prayed for
the Jewish people, but Moses, <span id="fr_2975"></span>[2976](#fn_2975.md)
when forgetful of their covenant they worshipped the head of the calf.
Was Moses wrong? Certainly he was not wrong in praying, who both merited
and obtained that for which he asked. For what should such love not
obtain as that of his when he offered himself for the people and said:
“And now, if Thou wilt forgive their sin, forgive; but if not, blot me
out of the book of life.” <span id="fr_2976"></span>[2977](#fn_2976.md) We
see that he does not think of himself, like a man full of fancies and
scruples, whether he may incur the risk of some offence, as Novatian
says he dreads that he might, but rather, thinking of all and forgetful
of himself, he was not afraid lest he should offend, so that he might
rescue and free the people from danger of offence.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.ix-p15"></span>43. Rightly, then, is it said: “Who
shall entreat for him?” It implies that it must be such an one as Moses
to offer himself for those who sin, or such as Jeremiah, who, though the
Lord said to him, “Pray not thou for this people,” <span
id="fr_2977"></span>[2978](#fn_2977.md) and yet he prayed and obtained
their forgiveness. For at the intercession of the prophet, and the
entreaty of so great a seer, the Lord was moved and said to Jerusalem,
which had meanwhile repented for its sins, and had said: “O Almighty
Lord God of Israel, the soul in anguish, and the troubled spirit crieth
unto Thee, hear, O Lord, and have mercy.” <span
id="fr_2978"></span>[2979](#fn_2978.md) And the Lord bids them lay aside
the garments of mourning, and to cease the groanings of repentance,
saying: “Put off, O Jerusalem, the garment of thy mourning and
affliction. and clothe thyself in beauty, the glory which God hath given
thee for ever.” <span id="fr_2979"></span>[2980](#fn_2979.md)

[Next: Chapter X. St. John did not absolutely forbid that prayer should
be made for those who “sin unto death,” since he knew that Moses,
Jeremiah, and Stephen had so prayed, and he himself implies that
forgiveness is not to be denied them.](2100297.md)
