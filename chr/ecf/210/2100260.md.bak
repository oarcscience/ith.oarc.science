<span id="iv.iv.vii.vii"></span>

#### <span id="iv.iv.vii.vii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.vii-p1"></span>Wishing to answer the above-stated
objection somewhat more fully, he maintains that this request, had it
not been impossible in itself, would have been possible for Christ to
grant; especially as the Father has given all judgment to Him; which
gift we must understand to have been given without any feature of
imperfection. However, he proves that the request must be reckoned
amongst the impossibilities. To make it really possible, he teaches that
Christ’s answer must be taken in accordance with His human nature, and
shows this next by an exposition of the passage. Lastly, he once more
confirms the reply he has given on the impossibility of Christ’s
session.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.vii-p2"></span>67. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.vii.vii-p2.1"></span>I ask</span> now whether they think the
request made by the wife and sons of Zebedee was possible or impossible
to human circumstances, or to any created being? If it was possible, how
is it that He Who made all things which were not had not the power of
granting a seat to His apostles on His right hand and on His left? or
how was it that He, to Whom the Father gave all judgment, could not
judge of men’s merits?

<span id="iv.iv.vii.vii-p3"></span>68. We know well in what way He gave
it; for how did the Son, who created all things out of nothing, receive
it as though in want? Had He not the judgment of those whose natures He
had made? The Father gave all judgment to the Son, “that all men should
honour the Son, even as they honour the Father.” <span
id="fr_2593"></span>[2594](#fn_2593.md) It is not therefore the power of
the Son, but our knowledge of it, that increases; nor does what is
learnt by us add aught to His being, but only to our advantage; so that
by knowing the Son of God, we may have eternal life.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.vii-p5"></span>69. As, then, in our knowledge of the
Son of God His honour, but our profit, not His, is concerned; if any one
thinks that the power of God is augmented by that honour, He must also
believe that God the Father can receive augmentation; for He is
glorified by our knowledge of Him, as is the Son: as it is written on
the word of the Son: “I have glorified Thee upon the earth.” <span
id="fr_2594"></span>[2595](#fn_2594.md) Therefore if that which was asked
for was at all possible, it certainly was in the power of the Son to
grant it.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.vii-p7"></span>70. Let them show, if they consider
it possible, who of men or of other created beings sits either on the
right hand or the left of God. For the Father says to the Son: “Sit Thou
on My right hand.” <span id="fr_2595"></span>[2596](#fn_2595.md) Therefore
if any one sits on the right hand of the Son, the Son is found to be
sitting (to speak in human wise) between Himself and the Father.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.vii-p9"></span>71. A thing impossible for man, then,
was asked of Him. But He was unwilling to say that men could not sit
with Him; seeing that He desired His divine glory should be veiled, and
not revealed before He rose again. <span
id="fr_2596"></span>[2597](#fn_2596.md) For before this, when He had
appeared in glory between His attendants Moses and Elias, He had warned
His disciples that they should tell no man what they had seen.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.vii-p11"></span>72. Therefore if it was not possible
for men or other created beings to merit this, the Son ought not to seem
to have less power because He gave not to His apostles, what the Father
has not given to men or other created beings. Or else let them say to
which of them He has given it. Certainly not to the angels; of whom
Scripture says that all the angels stood round about the throne. <span
id="fr_2597"></span>[2598](#fn_2597.md) Thus Gabriel said that he stands,
as it says: “I am Gabriel that stand before God.” <span
id="fr_2598"></span>[2599](#fn_2598.md)

<span id="iv.iv.vii.vii-p14"></span>73. Not to the angels, then, has He
given it, nor to the elders who worship Him that sitteth; for they do
not sit upon the seat of <span id="page_294">p. 294</span> <span
id="iv.iv.vii.vii-Page_294"></span>majesty, but as the Scripture has
said, round about the throne; for there are four and twenty other seats,
as we have it in the Revelation of John: “And upon the seats four and
twenty elders sitting.” <span id="fr_2599"></span>[2600](#fn_2599.md) In
the Gospel also the Lord Himself says: “When the Son of Man shall sit in
the throne of His glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging
the twelve tribes of Israel.” <span id="fr_2600"></span>[2601](#fn_2600.md)
He did not say that a share in His own throne could be given to the
apostles, but that there were those other twelve thrones; which,
however, we ought not to think of as referring to actual sitting down,
but as showing the happy issue of spiritual grace.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.vii-p17"></span>74. Lastly, in the Book of the
Kings, Micaiah the prophet said: “I saw the Lord God of Israel sitting
on His throne, and all the host of heaven standing around Him, on His
right hand and on His left.” <span id="fr_2601"></span>[2602](#fn_2601.md)
How then, when the angels stand on the right hand and on the left of the
Lord God, when all the host of heaven stands, shall men sit on the right
hand of God or on His left, to whom is promised as a reward for virtue
likeness to the angels, as the Lord says: “Ye shall be as the angels in
heaven?” <span id="fr_2602"></span>[2603](#fn_2602.md) “As the angels,” He
says, not “more than the angels.”

<span id="iv.iv.vii.vii-p20"></span>75. If, then, the Father has given
nothing more than the Son, the Son certainly has given nothing less than
the Father. Therefore the Son can in no wise be less than the Father.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.vii-p21"></span>76. Suppose, however, that it had
been possible for men to obtain what was desired; what does it mean when
He says: “But to sit on My right hand and on My left is not Mine to give
to you”? <span id="fr_2603"></span>[2604](#fn_2603.md) What is “Mine”?
Above He said: “Ye shall drink indeed of My cup;” and again He added:
“It is not Mine to give to you.” Above He said “Mine,” and again lower
down He said “Mine.” He made no change. And so the earlier passages tell
us why He said “Mine.”

<span id="iv.iv.vii.vii-p23"></span>77. For being asked by a woman as
man to allow her sons to sit on His right hand and His left, because she
asked Him as man, the Lord also as though only man answered concerning
His Passion: “Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink
of?” <span id="fr_2604"></span>[2605](#fn_2604.md)

<span id="iv.iv.vii.vii-p25"></span>78. Therefore because He spoke
according to the flesh of the Passion of His Body, He wished to show
that according to the flesh He left behind Him an example and pattern to
us of the endurance of suffering; but that according to His position as
man He could not grant them fellowship in the throne above. This is the
reason why He said: “It is not Mine;” as also in another place He says:
“My doctrine is not Mine.” <span id="fr_2605"></span>[2606](#fn_2605.md) It
is not, He says, spoken after my flesh; for the words which are divine
belong not to the flesh.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.vii-p27"></span>79. But how plainly He showed His
tenderness for His disciples, whom He loved, saying first: “Will ye
drink of My cup?” For as He could not grant what they sought, He offered
them something else, so that He might mention what He would assign to
them, before He denied them anything; in order that they might
understand that the failure lay more in the equity of their request to
Him, than in the wish of their Lord to show kindness.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.vii-p28"></span>80. “Ye shall indeed drink of My
cup,” He says; that is, “I will not refuse you the suffering, which My
flesh will undergo. For all that I have taken on Myself as man, ye can
imitate. I have granted you the victory of suffering, the inheritance of
the cross. ‘But to sit on My right hand and on My left is not Mine to
give to you.’” He did not say, “It is not Mine to give,” but: “It is not
Mine to give to you;” meaning by this, not that He lacked the power, but
that His creatures were wanting in merit.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.vii-p29"></span>81. Or take in another way the
words: “It is not Mine to give to you,” that is, “It is not Mine, for I
came to teach humility; it is not Mine, for I came, not to be ministered
unto, but to minister; it is not Mine, for I show justice, not favour.”

<span id="iv.iv.vii.vii-p30"></span>82. Then, speaking of the Father, He
added: “For whom it has been prepared,” to show that the Father also is
not wont to give heed merely to requests, but to merits; for God is not
a respecter of persons. <span id="fr_2606"></span>[2607](#fn_2606.md)
Wherefore also the Apostle says: “Whom He did foreknow, He also did
predestinate.” <span id="fr_2607"></span>[2608](#fn_2607.md) He did not
predestinate them before He knew them, but He did predestinate the
reward of those whose merits He foreknew.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.vii-p33"></span>83. Rightly then is the woman
checked, who demanded what was impossible, as a special kind of
privilege from Him the Lord, Who of His own free gift granted not only
to two apostles, but to all the disciples, those things which He had
adjudged to be given to the saints; and that too without a prayer from
any one, as it is written: “Ye shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging
the twelve tribes of Israel.” <span id="fr_2608"></span>[2609](#fn_2608.md)

<span id="iv.iv.vii.vii-p35"></span>84. Therefore, although we may think
the <span id="page_295">p. 295</span> <span
id="iv.iv.vii.vii-Page_295"></span>demand to have been possible, there
is no room for false attacks. However, when I read that the seraphim
stand, <span id="fr_2609"></span>[2610](#fn_2609.md) how can I suppose that
men may sit on the right hand or the left of the Son of God? The Lord
sits upon the cherubim, as it says: “Thou that sittest upon the
cherubim, show myself.” <span id="fr_2610"></span>[2611](#fn_2610.md) And
how shall the apostles sit upon the cherubim?

<span id="iv.iv.vii.vii-p38"></span>85. And I do not come to this
conclusion of my own mind, but because of the utterances of our Lord’s
own mouth. For the Lord Himself later on, in commending the apostles to
the Father, says: “Father, I will that they also whom Thou hast given Me
be with Me where I am.” <span id="fr_2611"></span>[2612](#fn_2611.md) But
if He had thought that the Father would give the divine throne to men,
He would have said: “I will that where I sit, they also may sit with
Me.” But He says: “I will that they be with Me,” not “that they may sit
with Me;” and “where I am,” not “as I am.”

<span id="iv.iv.vii.vii-p40"></span>86. Then follow the words: “That
they may see My glory.” Here too He did not say: “that they may have My
glory,” but “that they may see” it. For the servant sees, the Lord
possesses; as David also has taught us, saying: “That I may see the
delight of the Lord.” <span id="fr_2612"></span>[2613](#fn_2612.md) And the
Lord Himself in the Gospel has revealed it, stating: “Blessed are the
pure in heart, for they shall see God.” <span
id="fr_2613"></span>[2614](#fn_2613.md) “They shall see,” He says; not
“They shall sit with God upon the cherubim.”

<span id="iv.iv.vii.vii-p43"></span>87. Let them therefore cease to
think little of the Son of God according to His Godhead, lest they
should think little also of the Father. For he who believes wrongly of
the Son cannot think rightly of the Father; he who thinks wrongly of the
Spirit cannot think rightly of the Son. For where there is one dignity,
one glory, one love, one majesty, whatsoever thou thinkest is to be
withdrawn in the case of any one of the Three Persons, is withdrawn from
all alike. For that can never have completeness which thou canst
separate and divide into various portions.

[Next: Chapter VII. Objection is taken to the following passage: “Thou
hast loved them, as Thou hast loved Me.” To remove it, he shows first
the impiety of the Arian explanation; then compares these words with
others; and lastly, takes the whole passage into consideration. Hence he
gathers that the mission of Christ, although it is to be received
according to the flesh, is not to His detriment. When this is proved he
shows how the divine mission takes place.](2100261.md)
