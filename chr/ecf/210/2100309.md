#### <span id="iv.vi.iii.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.iv-p1"></span>St. Ambrose turns against the
Novatians themselves another objection concerning blasphemy against the
Holy Spirit, showing that it consists in an erroneous belief, proving
this by St. Peter’s words against Simon Magus, and other passages,
exhorting the Novatians to return to the Church, affirming that such is
our Lord’s mercy that even Judas would have found forgiveness had he
repented.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.iv-p2"></span>20. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.iii.iv-p2.1"></span>But</span> we have heard that you are
accustomed to bring forward as an objection that which is written:
“Every sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men, but blasphemies
against the Spirit shall not be forgiven unto men. And whosoever shall
speak a word against the Son of Man, it shall be forgiven him, but
whosoever shall speak against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven
him, neither in this world, nor in that which is to come.” <span
id="fr_3076"></span>[3077](#fn_3076.md) By which quotation the whole of
your assertion is destroyed and done away, for it is written: “Every sin
and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men.” <span id="page_348">p.
348</span> <span id="iv.vi.iii.iv-Page_348"></span>Why, then, do you not
remit them? Why do you bind chains which you do not loose? Why do you
tie knots which you do not unfasten? Forgive the others, and deal with
those who you think are bound for ever by the authority of the Gospel
for sinning against the Holy Spirit.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.iv-p4"></span>21. But let us consider the case of
those whom the Lord so binds, going back to the words before the passage
quoted, that we may understand it more clearly: The Jews were saying:
“This man doth not cast out devils, but by Beelzebub, prince of the
devils.” Jesus replied: “Every kingdom divided against itself shall be
destroyed, and every city or house divided against itself shall not
stand; for if Satan casteth out Satan, he is divided against himself,
how then shall his kingdom stand? But if I cast out devils by Beelzebub,
by whom do your sons cast them out?” <span
id="fr_3077"></span>[3078](#fn_3077.md)

<span id="iv.vi.iii.iv-p6"></span>22. Now we see plainly here that the
words are expressly used of those who were saying that the Lord Jesus
cast out devils through Beelzebub, to whom the Lord gave that answer,
because they were of the heritage of Satan, who compared the Saviour of
all to Satan, and attributed the grace of Christ to the kingdom of the
devil. And that we might know that He was speaking of this blasphemy, He
added: “O generation of vipers, how can ye speak good, being yourselves
evil?” He says, then, that those who thus speak attain not to
forgiveness.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.iv-p7"></span>23. Then, when Simon, depraved by long
practice of magic, had thought he could gain by money the power of
conferring the grace of Christ and the infusion of the Holy Spirit,
Peter said: “Thou hast neither part nor lot in this faith, for thy heart
is not right with God. Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray
the Lord, if perchance this thought of thy heart may be forgiven thee,
for I see that thou art in the bond of iniquity and in the bitterness of
gall.” <span id="fr_3078"></span>[3079](#fn_3078.md) We see that Peter by
his apostolic authority condemns him who blasphemes against the Holy
Spirit through magic vanity, and all the more because he had not the
clear consciousness of faith. And yet he did not exclude him from the
hope of forgiveness, for he called him to repentance.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.iv-p9"></span>24. The Lord then replies to the
blasphemy of the Pharisees, and refuses to them the grace of His power,
which consists in the remission of sins, because they asserted that His
heavenly power rested on the help of the devil. And He affirms that they
act with satanic spirit who divide the Church of God, so that He
includes the heretics and schismatics of all times, to whom He denies
forgiveness, for every other sin is concerned with single persons, this
is a sin against all. For they alone wish to destroy the grace of Christ
who rend asunder the members of the Church for which the Lord Jesus
suffered, and the Holy Spirit was given us.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.iv-p10"></span>25. Lastly, that we may know that He
is speaking of those who destroy the unity of the Church, we find it
written: “He that is not with Me is against Me, and he that gathered not
with Me, scattereth.” <span id="fr_3079"></span>[3080](#fn_3079.md) And
that we might know that He is speaking of these, He at once added:
“Therefore I say unto you, every sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven
unto men, but blasphemies against the Spirit shall not be forgiven unto
men.” When He says, “Therefore say I unto you,” is it not evident that
He intended the words following to be laid to heart by us beyond the
others? And He rightly added: “A good tree bringeth forth good fruits,
but a bad tree bringeth forth bad fruits,” <span
id="fr_3080"></span>[3081](#fn_3080.md) for an evil association cannot
produce good fruits. The tree, then, is the association; the fruits of
the good tree are the children of the Church.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.iv-p13"></span>26. Return, then, to the Church,
those of you who have wickedly separated yourselves. For He promises
forgiveness to all who are converted, since it is written: “Whosoever
shall call on the Name of the Lord shall be saved.” <span
id="fr_3081"></span>[3082](#fn_3081.md) And lastly, the Jewish people who
said of the Lord Jesus, “He hath a devil,” <span
id="fr_3082"></span>[3083](#fn_3082.md) and “He casteth out devils through
Beelzebub,” and who crucified the Lord Jesus, are, by the preaching of
Peter, called to baptism, that they may put away the guilt of so great a
wickedness.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.iv-p16"></span>27. But what wonder is it if you
should deny salvation to others, who reject your own, though they lose
nothing who seek for penance from you? For I suppose that even Judas
might through the exceeding mercy of God not have been shut out from
forgiveness, if he had expressed his sorrow not before the Jews but
before Christ. “I have sinned,” he said, “in that I have betrayed
righteous blood.” <span id="fr_3083"></span>[3084](#fn_3083.md) Their
answer was: “What is that to us, see thou to that.” What other reply do
you give, when one guilty of a smaller sin confesses his deed to you?
What do you answer but this: “What is that to us, see thou to that”? The
halter <span id="page_349">p. 349</span> <span
id="iv.vi.iii.iv-Page_349"></span>followed on those words, but the
punishment is all the more severe, the smaller the sin is.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.iv-p18"></span>28. But if they be not converted, do
you at least repent, who by many a slip have fallen from the lofty
pinnacle of innocence and faith. We have a good Lord, Whose will it is
to forgive all, Who called you by the prophet, and said: “I, even I, am
He that blotteth out transgressions, and I will not remember, but do
thou remember, and let us plead together.” <span

25](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#025.md)<span
id="iv.vi.iii.iv-p19.1"></span> \[LXX.\]. St. Ambrose, taking the
Septuagint reading, makes the contrast to be between man’s remembering
and God’s forgetting. But the contrast in the Hebrew is different: God
will do away sins of His pure mercy and challenges Israel to bring
forward any merits which can plead for pardon. God shows that His mercy
is even greater than His justice. St. Ambrose, as is shown more clearly
in chap. vi., is merely using a verbal antithesis.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Next: Chapter V. As to the words of St. Peter to Simon Magus, from
which the Novatians infer that there was no forgiveness for the latter,
it is pointed out that St. Peter, knowing his evil heart, might well use
words of doubt, and then by some Old Testament instances it is pointed
out that “perchance” does not exclude forgiveness. The apostles
transmitted to us that penitence, the fruits of which are shown in the
case of David. St. Ambrose then adduces the example of the Ephraimites,
whose penitence must be followed in order to gain the divine mercy and
the sacraments.](2100310.md)
