#### <span id="iv.vii.ii.xi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XI.

<span id="iv.vii.ii.xi-p1"></span>St. Ambrose answers objections made to
the uselessness of his exhortations in favour of virginity, and brings
forward instances of virgins especially in various places he mentions,
and speaks of their zeal in the cause.

<span id="iv.vii.ii.xi-p2"></span>57. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vii.ii.xi-p2.1"></span>Some</span> one may say, you are always
singing the praises of virgins. What shall I do who am always singing
them and have no success? But this is not my fault. Then, too, virgins
come from Placentia to be consecrated, or from Bononia, and Mauritania,
in order to receive the veil here. You see a striking thing here. I
treat the matter here, and persuade those who are elsewhere. If this be
so, let me treat the subject elsewhere, that I may persuade you.

<span id="iv.vii.ii.xi-p3"></span>58. What is it, then, that even they
who hear me not follow my teaching, and those who hear me follow me not?
For I have known many virgins who had the desire, but were prevented
from going forward by their mothers, and, which is more serious, mothers
who were widows, to whom I will now address myself. For if your
daughters desired to love a man, they could, by law, choose whom they
would. Are they, then, who are allowed to choose a man not allowed to
choose God?

<span id="iv.vii.ii.xi-p4"></span>59. Behold how sweet is the fruit of
modesty, which has sprung up even in the affections of barbarians.
Virgins coming from the most distant on this and that side of Mauritania
desire to be consecrated here; and though all the families be in bonds,
yet modesty cannot be bound. She who mourns over the hardship of slavery
avows an eternal kingdom.

<span id="iv.vii.ii.xi-p5"></span>60. And what shall I say of the
virgins of Bononia, a fertile band of chastity, who, forsaking worldly
delights, inhabit the sanctuary of virginity? <span
id="fr_3222"></span>[3223](#fn_3222.md) Not being of the sex which lives in
common, attaining in their common chastity to the number of twenty, and
fruit to an hundredfold, leaving their parents’ dwelling they press into
the houses of Christ, as soldiers of unwearied chastity; at one time
singing spiritual songs, they provide their sustenance by labour, and
seek with their hands supplies for their liberality.

<span id="iv.vii.ii.xi-p7"></span>61. But if the attraction of searching
for virgins has grown strong (for they beyond others follow up the
search and watch for purity), they follow up their hidden prey with the
greatest perseverance to its very chambers; or, if the flight of any one
shall have seemed more free, one may see them rise on the wing, hear the
rustling of their feathers, and the bursting of applause; so as to
surround the one on wing with a chaste band of modesty, until rejoicing
in that fair companionship, forgetful of her father’s house, she enters
the regions of modesty and the fenced-in home of chastity.

<span id="iv.vii.ii.xi-p6"></span> It was very unusual for women to live
together alone at this period.

[Next: Chapter XII. It is very desirable that parents should encourage
the desire for the virgin life, but more praiseworthy when the love of
God draws a maiden even against their will. The violence of parents and
the loss of property are not to be feared, and an instance of this is
related by St. Ambrose.](2100332.md)
