#### <span id="iv.iv.vi.ii-p0.1"></span>Chapter II.

<span id="iv.iv.vi.ii-p1"></span>None can ascend to heaven without
faith; in any case, he who hath so ascended thither will be cast out
wherefore, faith must be zealously preserved. We ourselves each have a
heaven within, the gates whereof must be opened and be raised by
confession of the Godhead of Christ, which gates are not raised by
Arians, nor by those who seek the Son amongst earthly things, and who
must therefore, like the Magdalene, be sent back to the apostles,
against whom the gates of hell shall not prevail. Scriptures are cited
to show that the servant of the Lord must not diminish aught of his
Master’s honour.

<span id="iv.iv.vi.ii-p2"></span>15. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.vi.ii-p2.1"></span>What</span> shall we do, then? How shall we
ascend unto heaven? There, powers are stationed, principalities drawn up
in order, who keep the doors of heaven, and challenge him who ascends.
Who shall give me passage, unless I proclaim that Christ is Almighty?
The gates are shut,—they are not opened to any and every one; not every
one who will shall enter, unless he also believes according to the true
Faith. The Sovereign’s court is kept under guard.

<span id="iv.iv.vi.ii-p3"></span>16. Suppose, however, that one who is
unworthy hath crept up, hath stolen past the principalities who keep the
gates of heaven, hath sat down at the supper of the Lord; when the Lord
of the banquet enters, and sees one not clad in the wedding garment of
the Faith, He will cast him into outer darkness, where is weeping and
gnashing of teeth, <span id="fr_2336"></span>[2337](#fn_2336.md) if he keep
not the Faith and peace.

<span id="iv.iv.vi.ii-p5"></span>17. Let us, therefore, keep the wedding
garment which we have received, and not deny Christ that which is His
own, Whose omnipotence angels announce, prophets foretel, apostles
witness to, even as we have already shown above. <span
id="fr_2337"></span>[2338](#fn_2337.md)

<span id="iv.iv.vi.ii-p7"></span>18. Perchance, indeed, the prophet hath
spoken of His entering in not only with regard to the gates of the
universal heaven; for there be other heavens also whereinto the Word of
God passeth, whereof it is said: “We have a great Priest, a High Priest,
Who hath passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God.” <span
id="fr_2338"></span>[2339](#fn_2338.md) What are those heavens, but even
the heavens whereof the prophet sayeth that “the heavens declare the
glory of God”? <span id="fr_2339"></span>[2340](#fn_2339.md)

<span id="iv.iv.vi.ii-p10"></span>19. For Christ standeth at the door of
thy soul. Hear Him speaking. “Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if
any man open to Me, I will come in to him, and I will sup with him, and
he with Me.” <span id="fr_2340"></span>[2341](#fn_2340.md) And the Church
saith, speaking of Him: “The voice of my brother soundeth at the
door.” <span id="fr_2341"></span>[2342](#fn_2341.md)

<span id="iv.iv.vi.ii-p13"></span>20. He stands, then—but not alone, for
before Him go angels, saying: “Lift up the gates, O ye the princes.”
What gates? Even those of the which the Psalmist sings in another place
also: “Open to me the gates of righteousness.” <span
id="fr_2342"></span>[2343](#fn_2342.md) Open, then, thy gates to Christ,
that He may come into thee—open the gates of righteousness, the gates of
chastity, the gates of courage and wisdom.

<span id="iv.iv.vi.ii-p15"></span>21. Believe the message of the angels:
“Be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors, and the King of glory shall come
in, the Lord of Sabaoth.” Thy gate is the loud confession made with
faithful voice; it is the door of the Lord, which the Apostle desires to
have opened for him, as he says: “That a door of the word may be opened
for me, to proclaim the mystery of Christ.” <span
id="fr_2343"></span>[2344](#fn_2343.md)

<span id="iv.iv.vi.ii-p17"></span>22. Let thy gate, then, be opened to
Christ, and let it be not only opened, but lifted up, if, indeed, it be
eternal and not condemned to ruin; for it is written: “And be ye lift
up, ye *everlasting* doors.” The lintel was lift up for Isaiah, when the
seraph touched his lips and he saw the Lord of Sabaoth.

<span id="iv.iv.vi.ii-p18"></span>23. Thy gates shall be lifted up,
then, if thou believest the Son of God to be eternal, omnipotent, above
and beyond all praise and understanding, knowing all things, both past
and to come, whilst if thou judgest Him to be of limited power and
knowledge, and subordinate, thou liftest not up the everlasting doors.

<span id="iv.iv.vi.ii-p19"></span>24. Be thy gates lifted up, then, that
Christ may come in unto thee, not such a Christ as the Arians take Him
to be—petty, and weak, and menial—but Christ in the form of God, Christ
with the Father; that He may enter such as He is, exalted above the
heaven and all things; and that He may send forth upon thee His Holy
Spirit. It is expedient <span id="page_265">p. 265</span> <span
id="iv.iv.vi.ii-Page_265"></span>for thee that thou shouldst believe
that He hath ascended and is sitting at the right hand of the Father,
for if in impious thought thou detain Him amongst things created and
earthly, if He depart not for thee, ascend not for thee, then to thee
the Comforter shall not come, even as Christ Himself hath told us: “For
if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you, but if I depart,
I will send Him unto you.” <span id="fr_2344"></span>[2345](#fn_2344.md)

<span id="iv.iv.vi.ii-p21"></span>25. But if thou shouldst seek Him
amongst earthly beings, even as Mary of Magdala sought Him, take heed
lest He say to thee, as unto her: “Touch Me not, for I am not yet
ascended unto My Father.” <span id="fr_2345"></span>[2346](#fn_2345.md) For
thy gates are narrow—they give me no passage—they cannot be lifted up,
and therefore I cannot come in.

<span id="iv.iv.vi.ii-p23"></span>26. Go thy way, therefore, to my
brethren—that is, to those everlasting doors, which, as soon as they see
Jesus, are lifted up. Peter is an “everlasting door,” against whom the
gates of hell shall not prevail. <span
id="fr_2346"></span>[2347](#fn_2346.md) John and James, the sons of
thunder, to wit, <span id="fr_2347"></span>[2348](#fn_2347.md) are
“everlasting doom.” Everlasting are the doors of the Church, where the
prophet, desirous to proclaim the praises of Christ, says: “That I may
tell all thy praises in the gates of the daughter of Sion.” <span
id="fr_2348"></span>[2349](#fn_2348.md)

<span id="iv.iv.vi.ii-p27"></span>27. Great, therefore, is the mystery
of Christ, before which even angels stood amazed and bewildered. For
this cause, then, it is thy duty to worship Him, and, being a servant,
thou oughtest not to detract from thy Lord. Ignorance thou mayest not
plead, for to this end He came down, that thou mayest believe; if thou
believest not, He has not come down for thee, has not suffered for thee.
“If I had not come,” saith the Scripture, “and spoken with them, they
would have no sin: but now have they no excuse for their sin. He that
hateth Me, hateth My Father also.” <span
id="fr_2349"></span>[2350](#fn_2349.md) Who, then, hates Christ, if not he
who speaks to His dishonour?—for as it is love’s part to render, so it
is hate’s to withdraw honour. <span id="fr_2350"></span>[2351](#fn_2350.md)
He who hates, calls in question; he who loves, pays reverence.

[Next: Chapter III. The words, “The head of every man is Christ…and the
head of Christ is God” misused by the Arians, are now turned back
against them, to their confutation. Next, another passage of Scripture,
commonly taken by the same heretics as a ground of objection, is called
in to show that God is the Head of Christ, in so far as Christ is human,
in regard of His Manhood, and the unwisdom of their opposition upon the
text, “He who planteth and He who watereth are one,” is displayed. After
which explanations, the meaning of the doctrine that the Father is in
the Son, and the Son in the Father, and that the faithful are in Both,
is expounded.](2100243.md)
