#### <span id="iv.i.ii.xxxii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXII.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxxii-p1"></span>After saying what return must be made
for the service of the above-mentioned feast, various reasons for
repaying kindness are enumerated. Then he speaks in praise of good-will,
on its results and its order.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxxii-p2"></span>165. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.ii.xxxii-p2.1"></span>It</span> is therefore a good thing for
us to be bedewed with the exhortations of the divine Scriptures, and
that the word of God should come down upon us like the dew. When,
therefore, thou sittest at the table of that great man, understand who
that great man is. Set in the paradise of delight and placed at the
feast of wisdom, think of what is put before thee! The divine Scriptures
are the feast of wisdom, and the single books the various dishes. Know,
first, what dishes the banquet offers, then stretch forth thy hand, that
those things which thou readest, or which thou receivest from the Lord
thy God, thou mayest carry out in action, and so by thy duties mayest
show forth the grace that was granted thee. Such was the case with Peter
and Paul, who in preaching the Gospel made some return to Him Who freely
gave them all things. So that each of them might say: “By the grace of
God I am what I am, and His grace in me was not in vain, but I laboured
more abundantly than they all.” <span id="fr_243"></span>[244](#fn_243.md)

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxxii-p4"></span>166. One repays the fruit of a
service done him, and repays it, gold with gold, silver with silver.
Another gives his labour. Another—and I do not know whether he does not
do it in fuller measure—gives but the best wishes of his heart. <span
id="fr_244"></span>[245](#fn_244.md) But what if there is no opportunity to
make a return at hand? If we wish to return a kindness, more depends on
the spirit in which we do it than on the amount of our property, whilst
people will think more of our good-will, than of our power to make a
full return. For a kindness done is regarded in the light of what one
has. A great thing, therefore, is good-will. For even if it has nothing
to give, yet it offers the more, and though there is nothing in its own
possession, yet it gives largely to many, and does that, too, without
loss to itself, and to the gain of the many. Thus good-will is better
than liberality itself. It is richer in character than the other is in
gifts; for there are more that need a kindness than there are that have
abundance.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxxii-p6"></span>167. But good-will also goes in
conjunction with liberality, for liberality really starts from it,
seeing that the habit of giving comes after the desire to give. It
exists, however, also separate and distinct. For where liberality is
wanting, there good-will abides—the parent as it were of all in common,
uniting and binding friendships together. It is faithful in counsel,
joyful in times of prosperity, and in times of sorrow sad. So it happens
that any one trusts himself to the counsels of a man of good-will rather
than to those of a wise one, as David did. For he, though he was the
more farseeing, agreed to the counsels of Jonathan, who was the
younger. <span id="fr_245"></span>[246](#fn_245.md) Remove good-will out of
the reach of men, and it is as though one had withdrawn the sun from the
world. <span id="fr_246"></span>[247](#fn_246.md) For without it men would
no longer care to show the way to the stranger, to recall the <span
id="page_29">p. 29</span> <span
id="iv.i.ii.xxxii-Page_29"></span>wanderer, to show hospitality (this
latter is no small virtue, for on this point Job praised himself, when
he said: “At my doors the stranger dwelt not, my gate was open to every
one who came”), <span id="fr_247"></span>[248](#fn_247.md) nor even to give
water from the water that flows at their door, or to light another’s
candle at their own. Thus good-will exists in all these, like a fount of
waters refreshing the thirsty, and like a light, which, shining forth to
others, fails not them who have given a light to others from their own
light. <span id="fr_248"></span>[249](#fn_248.md)

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxxii-p11"></span>168. There is also liberality
springing from good-will, that makes one tear up the bond of a debtor
which one holds, without demanding any of the debt back from him. Holy
Job bids us act thus by his own example. <span
id="fr_249"></span>[250](#fn_249.md) For he that has does not borrow, but
he that has not does not put an end to the agreement. Why, then, if thou
hast no need, dost thou save up for greedy heirs what thou canst give
back immediately, and so get praise for good-will, and that without loss
of money?

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxxii-p13"></span>169. To go to the root of the
matter—good-will starts first with those at home, that is with children,
parents, brothers, and goes on from one step to another throughout the
world. <span id="fr_250"></span>[251](#fn_250.md) Having started from
Paradise, it has filled the world. For God set the feeling of good-will
in the man and woman, saying: “They shall be one flesh,” <span
id="fr_251"></span>[252](#fn_251) and (one may add.md) one spirit.
Wherefore Eve also believed the serpent; for she who had received the
gift of good-will did not think there was ill-will.
