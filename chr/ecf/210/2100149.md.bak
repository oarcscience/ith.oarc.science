<span id="iv.ii.iii.xii"></span>

#### <span id="iv.ii.iii.xii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XI.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.xii-p1"></span>We shall follow the example of
Abdemelech, if we believe that the Son and Holy Spirit know all things.
This knowledge is attributed in Scripture to the Spirit, and also to the
Son. The Son is glorified by the Spirit, as also the Spirit by the Son.
Also, inasmuch as we read that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit say
and reveal the same things, we must acknowledge in Them a oneness of
nature and knowledge. Lastly, that the Spirit searcheth the deep things
of God is not a mark of ignorance, since the Father and the Son are
likewise said to search, and Paul, although chosen by Christ, yet was
taught by the Spirit.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.xii-p2"></span>114. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.ii.iii.xii-p2.1"></span>And</span> you, too, shall be
Abdemelech, <span id="fr_1173"></span>[1174](#fn_1173.md) that is, chosen
by the Lord, if you raise the Word of God from the depth of Gentile
ignorance; if you believe that the Son of God is not deceived, that
nothing escapes His knowledge, that He is not ignorant of what is going
to be. And the Holy Spirit also is not deceived, of Whom the Lord says:
“But when He, the Spirit of Truth, shall come, He shall lead you into
all truth.” <span id="fr_1174"></span>[1175](#fn_1174.md) He Who says *all*
passes by nothing, neither the day nor the hour, neither things past nor
things to come.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.xii-p5"></span>115. And that you may know that He
both knows all things, and foretells things to come, and that His
knowledge is one with that of the Father and the Son, hear what the
Truth of God says concerning Him: “For He shall not speak from Himself,
but what things He shall hear shall He speak, and He shall declare unto
you the things that are to come.” <span
id="fr_1175"></span>[1176](#fn_1175.md)

<span id="iv.ii.iii.xii-p7"></span>116. Therefore, that you may observe
that He knows all things, when the Son said: “But of that day and hour
knoweth no one, not even the Angels of heaven,” <span
id="fr_1176"></span>[1177](#fn_1176.md) He excepted the Holy Spirit. But if
the Holy Spirit is excepted from ignorance, how is the Son of God not
excepted?

<span id="iv.ii.iii.xii-p9"></span>117. But you say that He numbered the
Son of God also with the Angels. He numbered the Son indeed, but He did
not number the Spirit also. Confess, then, either that the Holy Spirit
is greater than the Son of God, so as to speak now not only as an Arian,
but even as a Photinian, <span id="fr_1177"></span>[1178](#fn_1177.md) or
acknowledge to what you ought to refer it that He said that the Son knew
not. For as man He could \[in His human nature\] be numbered with
creatures Who were created.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.xii-p11"></span><span id="page_130">p. 130</span>
<span id="iv.ii.iii.xii-Page_130"></span>118. But if you are willing to
learn that the Son of God knows all things, and has foreknowledge of
all, see that those very things which you think to be unknown to the
Son, the Holy Spirit received from the Son. He received them, however,
through Unity of Substance, as the Son received from the Father. “He,”
says He, “shall glorify Me, for He shall receive of Mine and shall
declare it unto you. All things whatsoever the Father hath are Mine,
therefore said I, He shall receive of Mine, and shall declare it unto
you.” <span id="fr_1178"></span>[1179](#fn_1178.md) What, then, is more
clear than this Unity? What things the Father hath pertain to the Son;
what things the Son hath the Holy Spirit also has received.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.xii-p13"></span>119. Yet learn that the Son knows
the day of judgment. We read in Zechariah: “And the Lord my God shall
come, and all the saints with Him. In that day there shall not be light,
but cold and frost, and it shall be one day, and that day is known unto
the Lord.” <span id="fr_1179"></span>[1180](#fn_1179.md) This day, then,
was known unto the Lord, Who shall come with His saints, to enlighten us
by His second Advent.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.xii-p15"></span>120. But let us continue the point
which we have commenced concerning the Spirit. For in the passage we
have brought forward you find that the Son says of the Spirit: “He shall
glorify Me.” So, then, the Spirit glorifies the Son, as the Father also
glorifies Him, but the Son of God also glorifies the Spirit, as we said
above. He, then, is not weak who is the cause of the mutual glory
through the Unity of the Eternal Light, nor is He inferior to the
Spirit, of Whom this is true that He is glorified by the Spirit.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.xii-p16"></span>122. And you too shall be chosen, if
you believe that the Spirit spoke that which the Father spoke, and which
the Son spoke. Paul, in fine, was therefore chosen because he so
believed and so taught, since, as it is written, God “hath revealed to
us by His Spirit that which eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, nor hath
entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for
them that love Him.” <span id="fr_1180"></span>[1181](#fn_1180.md) And
therefore is He called the Spirit of revelation, as you read: “For God
giveth to those who thus prepare themselves the Spirit of wisdom and
revelation, that He may be known.” <span
id="fr_1181"></span>[1182](#fn_1181.md)

<span id="iv.ii.iii.xii-p19"></span>123. There is, then, a Unity of
knowledge, since, as the Father, Who gives the Spirit of revelation,
reveals, so also the Son reveals, for it is written: “No one knoweth the
Son save the Father, neither doth any one know the Father save the Son,
and he to whom the Son shall will to reveal Him.” <span
id="fr_1182"></span>[1183](#fn_1182.md) He said more concerning the Son,
not because He has more than the Father, but lest He should be supposed
to have less. And not unfittingly is the Father thus revealed by the
Son, for the Son knows the Father even as the Father knows the Son.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.xii-p21"></span>124. Learn now that the Spirit too
knows God the Father, for it is written that, “As no one knoweth the
things of a man, save the spirit which is in him, so too the things of
God no one knoweth save the Spirit of God.” “No one,” he says, “knoweth
save the Spirit of God.” <span id="fr_1183"></span>[1184](#fn_1183.md) Is,
then, the Son of God excluded? Certainly not, since neither is the
Spirit excluded, when it is said: “And none knoweth the Father, save the
Son.”

<span id="iv.ii.iii.xii-p23"></span>125. Therefore the Father, Son, and
Holy Spirit are of one nature and of one knowledge. And the Spirit is
not to be numbered with all things which were made by the Son, since He
knew the Father, Whom (as it is written) who can know save the Son? But
the Holy Spirit knows also. What then? When the totality of created
things is spoken of, it follows that the Holy Spirit is not included.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.xii-p24"></span>126. Now I should like them to
answer what it is in man which knows the things of a man. Certainly that
must be reasonable which surpasses the other powers of the soul, and by
which the highest nature of man is estimated. What, then, is the Spirit,
Who knows the deep things of God, and through Whom Almighty God is
revealed? Is He inferior in the fulness of the Godhead Who is proved
even by this instance to be of one substance with the Father? Or is He
ignorant of anything Who knows the counsels of God, and His mysteries
which have been hidden <span id="fr_1184"></span>[1185](#fn_1184.md) from
the beginning? What is there that He knows not Who knows all things that
are of God? For “the Spirit searcheth even the deep things of
God.” <span id="fr_1185"></span>[1186](#fn_1185.md)

<span id="iv.ii.iii.xii-p27"></span>127. But lest you should think that
He searches things unknown, and so searches that He may learn that which
He knows not, it is stated first that God revealed them to us through
His Spirit, and at the same time in order that you may learn that the
Spirit knows the things which are revealed to us through the Spirit
Himself, it is said subsequently: “For who among men knoweth the things
of a man, save the <span id="page_131">p. 131</span> <span
id="iv.ii.iii.xii-Page_131"></span>spirit of the man which is in him?
so, too, the things of God knoweth no one save the Spirit of God.” <span
id="fr_1186"></span>[1187](#fn_1186.md) If, then, the spirit of a man knows
the things of a man, and knows them before it searches, can there be
anything of God which the Spirit of God knows not? Of Whom the Apostle
said not without a purpose, “The things of God knoweth no one, save the
Spirit of God;” not that He knows by searching, but knows by nature; not
that the knowledge of divine things is an accident in Him, but is His
natural knowledge.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.xii-p29"></span>128. But if this moves you that He
said “searcheth,” learn that this is also said of God, inasmuch as He is
the searcher of hearts and reins. For Himself said: “I am He that
searcheth the heart and reins.” <span
id="fr_1187"></span>[1188](#fn_1187.md) And of the Son of God you have also
in the Epistle to the Hebrews: “Who is the Searcher of the mind and
thoughts.” <span id="fr_1188"></span>[1189](#fn_1188.md) Whence it is clear
that no inferior searches the inward things of his superior, for to know
hidden things is of the divine power alone. The Holy Spirit, then, is a
searcher in like manner as the Father, and the Son is a searcher in like
manner, by the proper signification of which expression this is implied,
that evidently there is nothing which He knows not, Whom nothing
escapes.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.xii-p32"></span>129. Lastly, he was chosen by
Christ, and taught by the Spirit. For as he himself witnesses, having
obtained through the Spirit knowledge of the divine secrets, he shows
both that the Holy Spirit knows God, and has revealed to us the things
which are of God, as the Son also has revealed them. And he adds: “But
we received, not the spirit of this world, but the Spirit which is of
God, that we might know the things that are given to us by God, which we
also speak, not in persuasive words of man’s wisdom, but in
manifestation of the Spirit and in the power of God.” <span

[Next: Chapter XII. After proof that the Spirit is the Giver of
revelation equally with the Father and the Son, it is explained how the
same Spirit does not speak of Himself; and it is shown that no bodily
organs are to be thought of in Him, and that no inferiority is to be
supposed from the fact of our reading that He hears, since the same
would have to be attributed to the Son, and indeed even to the Father,
since He hears the Son. The Spirit then hears and glorifies the Son in
the sense that He revealed Him to the prophets and apostles, by which
the Unity of operation of the Three Persons is inferred; and, since the
Spirit does the same works as the Father, the substance of each is also
declared to be the same.](2100150.md)
