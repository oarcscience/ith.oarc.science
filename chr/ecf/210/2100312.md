#### <span id="iv.vi.iii.vii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VII.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.vii-p1"></span>An exhortation to mourning and
confession of sins for Christ is moved by these and the tears of the
Church. Illustration from the story of Lazarus. After showing that the
Novatians are the successors of those who planned to kill Lazarus, St.
Ambrose argues that the full forgiveness of every sin is signified by
the odour of the ointment poured by Mary on the feet of Christ; and
further, that the Novatian heretics find their likeness in Judas, who
grudged and envied when others rejoiced.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.vii-p2"></span>52. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.iii.vii-p2.1"></span>Let</span> us, then, mourn for a time,
that we may rejoice for eternity. Let us fear the Lord, let us
anticipate Him with the confession of our sins, let us correct our
backslidings and amend our faults, lest of us too it be said: “Woe is
me, my soul, for the godly man is perished from the earth, and there is
none amongst men to correct them.” <span
id="fr_3110"></span>[3111](#fn_3110.md)

<span id="iv.vi.iii.vii-p4"></span>53. Why do you fear to confess your
sins to our good Lord? “Set them forth,” He says, “that thou mayest be
justified.” The rewards of justification are set before him who is still
guilty of sin, for he is justified who voluntarily confesses his own
sin; and lastly, “the just man is his own accuser in the beginning of
his speaking.” <span id="fr_3111"></span>[3112](#fn_3111.md) The Lord knows
all things, but He waits for your words, not that He may punish, but
that He may pardon. It is not His will that the devil should triumph
over you and accuse you when you conceal your sins. Be beforehand with
your accuser: if you accuse yourself, you will fear no accuser; if you
report yourself, though you were dead you shall live.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.vii-p6"></span>54. Christ will come to your grave,
and if He finds there weeping for you Martha the woman of good service,
and Mary who carefully heard the Word of God, like holy Church which has
chosen the best part, He will be moved with compassion, when at your
death He shall see the tears of many and will say: “Where have ye laid
him?” <span id="fr_3112"></span>[3113](#fn_3112.md) that is to say, in what
condition of guilt is he? in which rank of penitents? I would see him
for whom ye weep, that he himself may move Me with his tears. I will see
if he is already dead to that sin for which forgiveness is entreated.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.vii-p8"></span>55. The people will say to Him, “Come
and see.” <span id="fr_3113"></span>[3114](#fn_3113.md) What is the meaning
of “Come”? It means, Let forgiveness of sins come, let the life of the
departed come, the resurrection of the dead, let Thy kingdom come to
this sinner also.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.vii-p10"></span>56. He will come and will command
that the stone be taken away which his fall has laid on the shoulders of
the sinner. He could have removed the stone by a word of command, for
even inanimate nature is wont to obey the bidding of Christ. He could by
the silent power of His working have removed the stone of the sepulchre,
at Whose Passion the stones being suddenly removed many sepulchres of
the dead were opened, but He bade men remove the stone, in very truth
indeed, that the unbelieving might believe what they saw, and see the
dead rising again, but in a type that He might give us the power of
lightening the burden of sins, the heavy pressure as it were upon the
guilty. Ours it is to remove the burdens, His to raise again, His to
bring forth from the tombs those set free from their bands.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.vii-p11"></span>57. So the Lord Jesus, seeing the
heavy burden of the sinner, weeps, for the Church alone He suffers not
to weep. He has compassion with His beloved, and says to him that is
dead, “Come forth,” <span id="fr_3114"></span>[3115](#fn_3114.md) that is,
Thou who liest in darkness of conscience, and in the squalor of thy
sins, as in the prison-house of the guilty, come forth, declare thy sins
that thou mayest be justified. “For with the mouth confession is made
unto salvation.” <span id="fr_3115"></span>[3116](#fn_3115.md)

<span id="iv.vi.iii.vii-p14"></span>58. If you have confessed at the
call of Christ the bars will be broken, and every chain loosed, even the
stench of the bodily corruption be grievous. For he had been dead four
days and his flesh stank in the tomb; but He Whose flesh saw no
corruption was three days in the sepulchre, for He knew no evils of the
flesh, which consists of the substances of the four elements. However
great, then, the stench of the dead body may be, it is all done away so
soon as the sacred ointment has shed its odour; and the dead rises
again, and the command is given to loose his hands who till now was in
sin; the covering is taken from his face which veiled the truth of the
grace which he had received. But since he has received for<span
id="page_353">p. 353</span> <span
id="iv.vi.iii.vii-Page_353"></span>giveness, the command is given to
uncover his face, to lay bare his features. For he whose sin is forgiven
has nothing whereof to be ashamed.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.vii-p15"></span>59. But in the presence of such
grace given by the Lord, of such a miracle of divine bounty, when all
ought to have rejoiced, the wicked were stirred up and gathered a
council against Christ, <span id="fr_3116"></span>[3117](#fn_3116.md) and
wished moreover to kill Lazarus also. <span
id="fr_3117"></span>[3118](#fn_3117.md) Do you not recognize that you are
the successors of those whose hardness you inherit? For you too are
angry and gather a council against the Church, because you see the dead
come to life again in the Church, and to be raised again by receiving
forgiveness of their sins. And thus, so far as in you, you desire to
slay again through envy those who are raised to life.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.vii-p18"></span>60. But Jesus does not revoke His
benefits, nay, rather He amplifies them by additions of His liberality,
He anxiously revisits him who was raised again, and rejoicing in the
gift of the restored life, He comes to the feast which His Church has
prepared for Him, at which he who had been dead is found as one amongst
those sitting down with Christ.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.vii-p19"></span>61. Then all wonder who look upon
him with the pure gaze of the mind, who are free from envy, for such
children the Church has. They wonder, as I said, how he who yesterday
and the day before lay in the tomb is one of those sitting with the Lord
Jesus.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.vii-p20"></span>62. Mary herself pours ointment on
the feet of the Lord Jesus. <span id="fr_3118"></span>[3119](#fn_3118.md)
Perchance for this reason on His feet, because one of the lowliest has
been snatched from death, for we are all the body of Christ, <span
id="fr_3119"></span>[3120](#fn_3119.md) but others perchance are the more
honourable members. The Apostle was the mouth of Christ, for he said,
“Ye seek a proof of Christ that speaketh in me.” <span
id="fr_3120"></span>[3121](#fn_3120.md) The prophets through whom He spake
of things to come were His mouth, would that I might be found worthy to
be His foot, and may Mary pour on me her precious ointment, and anoint
me and wipe away my sin.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.vii-p24"></span>63. What, then, we read concerning
Lazarus we ought to believe of every sinner who is converted, who,
though he may have been stinking, nevertheless is cleansed by the
precious ointment of faith. For faith has such grace that there where
the dead stank the day before, now the whole house is filled with good
odour.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.vii-p25"></span>64. The house of Corinth stank, when
it was written concerning it: “It is reported that there is fornication
among you, and such fornication as is not even among the
Gentiles.” <span id="fr_3121"></span>[3122](#fn_3121.md) There was a
stench, for a little leaven had corrupted the whole lump. A good odour
began when it was said: “If ye forgive anything to any one I forgive
also. For what I also have forgiven, for your sakes have I done it in
the person of Christ.” <span id="fr_3122"></span>[3123](#fn_3122.md) And
so, the sinner being set free, there was great joy in that place, and
the whole house was filled with the odour of the sweetness of grace.
Wherefore the Apostle, knowing well that he had shed upon all the
ointment of apostolic forgiveness, says: “We are a sweet savour of
Christ unto God in them that are saved.” <span
id="fr_3123"></span>[3124](#fn_3123.md)

<span id="iv.vi.iii.vii-p29"></span>65. At the pouring forth, then, of
this ointment all rejoice; Judas alone speaks against it. <span
id="fr_3124"></span>[3125](#fn_3124.md) So, too, now he who is a sinner
speaks against it, he who is a traitor blames it, but he is himself
blamed by Christ, as he knows not the remedy of the Lord’s death, and
understands not the mystery of that so great burial. For the Lord both
suffered and died that He might redeem us from death. This is manifest
from the most excellent value from His death, which is sufficient for
the absolution of the sinner, and his restoration to fresh grace; so
that all may come and wonder at his sitting at table with Christ, and
may praise God, saying: “Let us eat and feast, for he was dead and is
alive again, had perished and is found.” <span
id="fr_3125"></span>[3126](#fn_3125.md) But any one devoid of faith
objects: “Why does He eat with publicans and sinners?” This is his
answer: “They that are whole have no need of the physician, but they
that are sick.” <span id="fr_3126"></span>[3127](#fn_3126.md)

[Next: Chapter VIII. In urging repentance St. Ambrose turns to his own
case, expressing the wish that he could wash our Lord's feet like the
woman in the Gospel, which is a great pattern of penitence, though such
as cannot attain to it find acceptance. He prays for himself, especially
that he may sorrow with sinners, who are better than himself. Those for
whom Christ died are not to be contemned.](2100313.md)
