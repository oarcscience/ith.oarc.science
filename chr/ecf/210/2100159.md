#### <span id="iv.ii.iv.vii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VII.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.vii-p1"></span>The Son Himself does not judge or
punish without the Spirit, so that the same Spirit is called the Sword
of the Word. But inasmuch as the Word is in turn called the Sword of the
Spirit, the highest unity of power is thereby recognized in each.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.vii-p2"></span>44. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.ii.iv.vii-p2.1"></span>But</span> what should we say of the other
points? We have heard that the Lord Jesus not only judges in the Spirit
but punishes also. For neither would He punish Antichrist, whom, as we
read, “the Lord Jesus shall slay with the Spirit of His mouth,” <span
id="fr_1285"></span>[1286](#fn_1285.md) unless He had before judged of his
deserts. Yet here is not a grace received, but the unity remains
undivided, since neither can Christ be without the Spirit, nor the
Spirit without Christ. For the unity of the divine nature cannot be
divided.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.vii-p4"></span>45. And since that instance comes
before us, that the Lord Jesus shall slay with the Spirit of His mouth,
the Spirit is understood to be as it were the Sword of the Word. Lastly,
in the Gospel also the Lord Jesus Himself says: “I came not to send
peace but a sword.” <span id="fr_1286"></span>[1287](#fn_1286.md) For He
came that He might give the Spirit; and so there is in His mouth a
two-edged sword, <span id="fr_1287"></span>[1288](#fn_1287.md) which is in
truth the grace of the Spirit. So the Spirit is the Sword of the Word.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.vii-p7"></span>46. And that you may know that there
is no inequality but unity of nature, the Word also is the Sword of the
Holy Spirit, for it is written: “Taking the shield of faith, wherewith
ye may be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one. And take
the helmet of Salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word
of God.” <span id="fr_1288"></span>[1289](#fn_1288.md)

<span id="iv.ii.iv.vii-p9"></span>47. Since, then, the Sword of the Word
is the Holy Spirit, and the Sword of the Holy Spirit is the Word of God,
there is certainly in Them oneness of power.

[Next: Chapter VIII. The aforesaid unity is proved hereby, that as the
Father is said to be grieved and tempted, so too the Son. The Son was
also tempted in the wilderness, where a figure of the cross was set up
in the brazen serpent: but the Apostle says that the Spirit also was
there tempted. St. Ambrose infers from this that the Israelites were
guided into the promised land by the same Spirit, and that His will and
power are one with those of the Father and the Son.](2100160.md)
