#### <span id="iv.i.iii.xviii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.

<span id="iv.i.iii.xviii-p1"></span>We learn from the fact of the
separation of the ten tribes from King Rehoboam what harm bad
counsellors can do.

<span id="iv.i.iii.xviii-p2"></span>93. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.iii.xviii-p2.1"></span>Justice</span>, then, especially graces
men that are set over any office; <span
id="fr_512"></span>[513](#fn_512.md) on the other hand, injustice fails
them and fights against them. Scripture itself gives us an example,
where it says, that when the people of Israel, after the death of
Solomon, had asked his son Rehoboam to free their neck from their cruel
yoke, and to lighten the harshness of his father’s rule, he, despising
the counsel of the old men, gave the following answer at the suggestion
of the young men: “He would add a burden to the yoke of his father, and
change their lighter toils for harder.” <span
id="fr_513"></span>[514](#fn_513.md)

<span id="iv.i.iii.xviii-p5"></span>94. Angered by this answer, the
people said: “We have no portion in David, nor inheritance in the son of
Jesse. Return to your tents, O Israel. For we will not have this man for
a prince or a leader over us.” <span id="fr_514"></span>[515](#fn_514.md)
So, forsaken and deserted by the people, he could keep with him scarce
two of the ten tribes for David’s sake.
