<span id="iv.ii.iii.iii"></span>

#### <span id="iv.ii.iii.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter II.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.iii-p1"></span>The Father, the Son, and the Holy
Spirit are One in counsel.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.iii-p2"></span>20. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.ii.iii.iii-p2.1"></span>For</span> the Spirit Himself is Power,
as you read: “The Spirit of Counsel and of Power (or might).” <span
id="fr_1034"></span>[1035](#fn_1034.md) And as the Son is the Angel of
great counsel, so, too, is the Holy Spirit the Spirit of Counsel, that
you may know that the Counsel of the Father, the Son, and the Holy
Spirit is One. Counsel, not concerning any doubtful matters, but
concerning those foreknown and determined.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.iii-p4"></span>21. But that the Spirit is the
Arbiter of the Divine Counsel, you may know even from this. For when
above <span id="fr_1035"></span>[1036](#fn_1035.md) we showed that the Holy
Spirit was the Lord of baptism, and read that baptism is the counsel of
God, as you read, “But the Pharisees despised the counsel of God, not
being baptized of Him,” <span id="fr_1036"></span>[1037](#fn_1036.md) it is
quite clear that as there can be no baptism without the Spirit, so, too,
the counsel of God is not without the Spirit.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.iii-p7"></span>22. And that we may know more
completely that the Spirit is Power, we ought to know that He was
promised when the Lord said: “I will pour out of My Spirit upon all
flesh.” <span id="fr_1037"></span>[1038](#fn_1037.md) He, then, Who was
promised to us is Himself Power, as in the Gospel the same Son of God
declared when He said: “And I will send the promise of the Father upon
you, but do you remain in the city until ye be endued with power from on
high.” <span id="fr_1038"></span>[1039](#fn_1038.md)

<span id="iv.ii.iii.iii-p10"></span>23. And the Evangelist so far shows
that the Spirit is Power, that St. Luke relates that He came down with
great power, when he says: “And suddenly there was a sound from heaven,
as though the Spirit were borne with great power.” <span
id="fr_1039"></span>[1040](#fn_1039.md)

<span id="iv.ii.iii.iii-p12"></span><span id="page_118">p. 118</span>
<span id="iv.ii.iii.iii-Page_118"></span>24. But, again, that you may
not suppose that this is to be referred to bodily things and perceptible
to the senses, learn that the Spirit so descended as Christ is to
descend, as you find: “They shall see the Son of Man coming in the
clouds with great power and majesty.” <span
id="fr_1040"></span>[1041](#fn_1040.md)

<span id="iv.ii.iii.iii-p14"></span>25. For how should not the power and
might be one, when the work is one, the judgment one, the temple one,
the life-giving one, the sanctification one, and the kingdom also of the
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit one?
