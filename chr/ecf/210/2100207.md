<span id="iv.iv.iv.iii"></span>

#### <span id="iv.iv.iv.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter II.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.iii-p1"></span>The goodness of the Son of God is
proved from His works, namely, His benefits that He showed towards the
people of Israel under the Old Covenant, and to Christians under the
New. It is to one’s own interest to believe in the goodness of Him Who
is one’s Lord and Judge. The Father’s testimony to the Son. No small
number of the Jewish people bear witness to the Son; the Arians
therefore are plainly worse than the Jews. The words of the Bride,
declaring the same goodness of Christ.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.iii-p2"></span>20. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.iv.iii-p2.1"></span>Howbeit</span>, I would not that the Son
should rely on the mere prerogative of His nature and the claims of
peculiar rights of His Majesty. Let us not call Him good, if He merit
not the title; and if He merit not this by works, by acts of
lovingkindness, let Him waive the right He enjoys by virtue of His
nature, and be submitted to our judgment. He Who is to judge us disdains
not to be brought to judgment, that He may be “justified in His saying,
and clear when He is judged.” <span id="fr_1922"></span>[1923](#fn_1922)

<span id="iv.iv.iv.iii-p4"></span>21. Is He then not good, Who hath
shown me good things? Is He not good, Who when six hundred thousand of
the people of the Jews fled before their pursuers, suddenly opened the
tide of the Red Sea, an unbroken mass of waters?—so that the waves
flowed round the faithful, and were walls to them, but poured back and
overwhelmed the unbelievers. <span id="fr_1923"></span>[1924](#fn_1923)

<span id="iv.iv.iv.iii-p6"></span>22. Is He not good, at Whose command
the seas became firm ground for the feet of them that fled, and the
rocks gave forth water for the thirsty? <span
id="fr_1924"></span>[1925](#fn_1924) so that the handiwork of the true
Creator might be known, when the fluid became solid, and the rock
streamed with water? That we might acknowledge this as the handiwork of
Christ, the Apostle said: “And that rock was Christ.” <span
id="fr_1925"></span>[1926](#fn_1925)

<span id="iv.iv.iv.iii-p9"></span>23. Is He not good, Who in the
wilderness fed with bread from heaven such countless thousands of the
people, lest any famine should assail them, without need of toil, in the
enjoyment of rest?—so that, for the space of forty years, their raiment
grew not old, nor were their shoes worn, <span
id="fr_1926"></span>[1927](#fn_1926) a figure to the faithful of the
Resurrection that was to come, showing that neither the glory of great
deeds, nor the beauty of the power wherewith He hath clothed us, nor the
stream of human life is made for nought?

<span id="iv.iv.iv.iii-p11"></span>24. Is He not good, Who exalted earth
to heaven, so that, just as the bright companies of stars reflect His
glory in the sky, as in a glass, so the choirs of apostles, martyrs, and
priests, shining like glorious stars, might give light throughout the
world. <span id="fr_1927"></span>[1928](#fn_1927)

<span id="iv.iv.iv.iii-p13"></span>25. Not only, then, is He good, but
He is more. He is a good Shepherd, not only for <span id="page_227">p.
227</span> <span id="iv.iv.iv.iii-Page_227"></span>Himself, but to His
sheep also, “for the good shepherd layeth down his life for his sheep.”
Aye, He laid down His life to exalt ours—but it was in the power of His
Godhead that He laid it down and took it again: “I have power to lay
down My life, and I have power to take it. No man taketh it from Me, but
I lay it down of Myself.” <span id="fr_1928"></span>[1929](#fn_1928)

<span id="iv.iv.iv.iii-p15"></span>26. Thou seest His goodness, in that
He laid it down of His own accord: thou seest His power, in that He took
it again—dost thou deny His goodness, when He has said of Himself in the
Gospel, “If I am good, why is thine eye evil”? <span
id="fr_1929"></span>[1930](#fn_1929) Ungrateful wretch what doest thou?
Dost thou deny His goodness, in Whom is thy hope of good things—if,
indeed, thou believest this? Dost thou deny His goodness, Who hath given
us what “eye hath not seen, nor ear heard?” <span
id="fr_1930"></span>[1931](#fn_1930)

<span id="iv.iv.iv.iii-p18"></span>27. It concerns my interest to
believe Him to be good, for “It is a good thing to trust in the
Lord.” <span id="fr_1931"></span>[1932](#fn_1931) It is to my interest
to confess Him Lord, for it is written: “Give thanks unto the Lord, for
He is good.” <span id="fr_1932"></span>[1933](#fn_1932)

<span id="iv.iv.iv.iii-p21"></span>28. It is to my interest to esteem my
Judge to be good, for the Lord is a righteous Judge to the house of
Israel. If, then, the Son of God is Judge, surely, seeing that the Judge
is the righteous God and the Son of God is Judge, \[it follows that\] He
who is Judge and Son of God is the righteous God. <span
id="fr_1933"></span>[1934](#fn_1933)

<span id="iv.iv.iv.iii-p23"></span>29. But perchance thou believest not
others, nor the Son. Hear, then, the Father saying: “My heart hath
brought forth out of its depth the good Word.” <span
id="fr_1934"></span>[1935](#fn_1934) The Word, then, is good—the Word,
of Whom it is written: “And the Word was with God, and the Word was
God.” <span id="fr_1935"></span>[1936](#fn_1935) If, therefore, the Word
is good, and the Son is the Word of God, surely, though it displease the
Arians, the Son of God is God. Let them now at least blush for shame.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.iii-p26"></span>30. The Jews used to say: “He is
good.” Though some said: “He is not,” yet others said: “He is good,”—and
ye do *all* deny His goodness.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.iii-p27"></span>31. He is good who forgives the sin
of one man; is He not good Who has taken away the sin of the world? For
it was of Him that it was said: “Behold the Lamb of God, behold Him Who
taketh away the sin of the world.” <span
id="fr_1936"></span>[1937](#fn_1936)

<span id="iv.iv.iv.iii-p29"></span>32. But why do we doubt? The Church
hath believed in His goodness all these ages, and hath confessed its
faith in the saying: “Let Him kiss me with the kisses of His mouth; for
thy breasts are better than wine;” <span
id="fr_1937"></span>[1938](#fn_1937) and again: “And thy throat is like
the goodliest wine.” Of His goodness, therefore, He nourisheth us with
the breasts of the Law and Grace, soothing men’s sorrows with telling
them of heavenly things; and do we, then, deny His goodness, when He is
the manifestation of goodness, expressing in His Person the likeness of
the Eternal Bounty, even as we showed above that it was written, that He
is the spotless reflection and counterpart of that Bounty? <span
id="fr_1938"></span>[1939](#fn_1938)
