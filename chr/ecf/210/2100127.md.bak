#### <span id="iv.ii.ii.viii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VII.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.viii-p1"></span>The Holy Spirit is not a creature,
seeing that He is infinite, and was shed upon the apostles dispersed
through all countries, and moreover sanctifies the Angels also, to whom
He makes us equal. Mary was full of the same likewise, so too, Christ
the Lord, and so far all things high and low. And all benediction has
its origin from His operation, as was signified in the moving of the
water at Bethesda.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.viii-p2"></span>81. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.ii.ii.viii-p2.1"></span>Since</span> then, every creature is
confined within certain limits of its own nature, and inasmuch as those
invisible operations, which cannot be circumscribed by place and bounds,
yet are closed in by the property of their own substance; how can any
one dare to call the Holy Spirit a creature, Who has not a limited and
circumscribed power? because He is always in all things and everywhere,
which assuredly is the property of Divinity and Lordship, for: “The
earth is the Lord’s and the fulness thereof.” <span
id="fr_889"></span>[890](#fn_889.md)

<span id="iv.ii.ii.viii-p4"></span>81. And so, when the Lord appointed
His servants the apostles, that we might recognize that the creature was
one thing and the grace of the Spirit another, He appointed them to
different places, because all could not be everywhere at once. But He
gave the Holy Spirit to all, to shed upon the apostles though separated
the gift of indivisible grace. The persons, then, were different, but
the accomplishment of the working was in all one, because the Holy
Spirit is one of Whom it is said: “Ye shall receive power, even the Holy
Spirit coming upon you, and ye shall be witnesses to Me in Jerusalem and
in all Judea and Samaria, and unto the ends of the earth.” <span
id="fr_890"></span>[891](#fn_890.md)

<span id="iv.ii.ii.viii-p6"></span>82. The Holy Spirit, then, is
uncircumscribed and infinite, Who infused Himself into the minds of the
disciples throughout the separate divisions of distant regions, and the
remote bounds of the whole world, Whom nothing is able to escape or to
deceive. And therefore holy David says: “Whither shall I go from Thy
Spirit, or whither shall I flee from Thy face.” <span
id="fr_891"></span>[892](#fn_891.md) Of what Angel does the Scripture say
this? of what Dominion? of what Power? of what Angel do we find the
power diffused over many? For Angels were sent to few, but the Holy
Spirit was poured upon whole peoples. Who, then, can doubt that that is
divine which is shed upon many at once and is not seen; but that that is
corporeal which is seen and held by individuals?

<span id="iv.ii.ii.viii-p8"></span>83. But in like manner as the Spirit
sanctifying the apostles is not a partaker of human nature; so, too, He
sanctifying Angels, Dominions, and Powers, has no partnership with
creatures. But if any think that the holiness of the Angels is not
spiritual, but some other kind of grace belonging to the property of
their nature, they will forsooth judge Angels to be inferior to men. For
since themselves also confess that they would not dare to compare Angels
to the Holy Spirit, and they cannot deny that the Holy Spirit is shed
upon men; but the sanctification of the Spirit is a divine gift and
favour, men who possess a better kind of sanctification will certainly
be found to be preferred to the Angels. But since Angels come down to
men to assist them, it must be understood that the nature of Angels is
higher as it receives more of the grace of the Spirit, and that the
favour awarded to us and to them comes from the same author.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.viii-p9"></span>84. But how great is that grace which
makes even the lower nature of the lot of men equal to the gifts
received by Angels, as the Lord Himself promised, saying: “Ye shall be
as the Angels in heaven.” Nor is it difficult, for He Who made those
Angels in the Spirit will by the same grace make men also equal to the
Angels.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.viii-p10"></span>85. But of what creature can it be
said that it fills all things, as is written of the Holy Spirit: “I will
pour My Spirit upon all flesh.” <span id="fr_892"></span>[893](#fn_892.md)
This cannot be said of an Angel. Lastly, Gabriel himself, when sent to
Mary, said: “Hail, full of grace,” <span
id="fr_893"></span>[894](#fn_893.md) plainly declaring the grace of the
Spirit which was in her, because the Holy Spirit had come upon her, and
she was about to have her womb full of grace with the heavenly Word.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.viii-p13"></span>86. For it is of the Lord to fill
all things, Who says: “I fill heaven and earth.” <span
id="fr_894"></span>[895](#fn_894.md) If, then, it is the Lord Who fills
heaven and earth, Who can judge the Holy Spirit to be without a share in
the dominion and divine power, seeing that He has filled the world, and
what is beyond the whole world, filled Jesus the Redeemer of the whole
world? For it is written: “But Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, departed
from Jordan.” <span id="fr_895"></span>[896](#fn_895.md) Who, then, except
one who possessed the same fulness could fill Him Who fills all things?

<span id="iv.ii.ii.viii-p16"></span>87. But lest they should object that
this was said according to the flesh, though He alone from Whose flesh
went forth virtue to heal all, was more than all; yet, as the Lord fills
all things, so, too, we read of the Spirit: “For the Spirit of the Lord
filled the whole world.” <span id="fr_896"></span>[897](#fn_896.md) And you
find it said of all <span id="page_105">p. 105</span> <span
id="iv.ii.ii.viii-Page_105"></span>who had consorted with the Apostles
that, “filled with the Holy Spirit they spoke the word of God with
boldness.” <span id="fr_897"></span>[898](#fn_897.md) You see that the
Spirit gives both fulness and boldness, Whose operation the archangel
announces to Mary, saying: “The Holy Spirit shall come on thee.” <span
id="fr_898"></span>[899](#fn_898.md)

<span id="iv.ii.ii.viii-p20"></span>88. You read, too, in the Gospel
that the Angel descended at the appointed time into the pool and
troubled the water, and he who first went down into the pool was made
whole. <span id="fr_899"></span>[900](#fn_899.md) What did the Angel
declare in this type but the descent of the Holy Spirit, which was to
come to pass in our day, and should consecrate the waters when invoked
by the prayers of the priest? That Angel, then, was a herald of the Holy
Spirit, inasmuch as by means of the grace of the Spirit medicine was to
be applied to our infirmities of soul and mind. The Spirit, then, has
the same ministers as God the Father and Christ. He fills all things,
possesses all things, works all and in all in the same manner as God the
Father and the Son work.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.viii-p22"></span>89. What, then, is more divine than
the working of the Holy Spirit, since God Himself testifies that the
Holy Spirit presides over His blessings, saying: “I will put My Spirit
upon thy seed and My blessings upon thy children.” <span
id="fr_900"></span>[901](#fn_900.md) For no blessing can be full except
through the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. Wherefore, too, the Apostle
found nothing better to wish us than this, as He himself said: “We cease
not to pray and make request for you that ye may be filled with the
knowledge of His will, in all wisdom and spiritual understanding walking
worthily of God.” <span id="fr_901"></span>[902](#fn_901.md) He taught,
then, that this was the will of God, that rather by walking in good
works and words and affections, we should be filled with the will of
God, Who puts His Holy Spirit in our hearts. Therefore if he who has the
Holy Spirit is filled with the will of God, there is certainly no
difference of will between the Father and the Son.

[Next: Chapter VIII. The Holy Spirit is given by God alone, yet not
wholly to each person, since there is no one besides Christ capable of
receiving Him wholly. Charity is shed abroad by the Holy Spirit, Who,
prefigured by the mystical ointment, is shown to have nothing common
with creatures; and He, inasmuch as He is said to proceed from the mouth
of God, must not be classed with creatures, nor with things divisible,
seeing He is eternal.](2100128.md)
