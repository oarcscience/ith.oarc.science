#### <span id="iv.iv.iii.xviii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVII.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xviii-p1"></span>That Christ is very God is proved
from the fact that He is God’s own Son, also from His having been
begotten and having come forth from God, and further, from the unity of
will and operation subsisting in Father and Son. The witness of the
apostles and of the centurion—which St. Ambrose sets over against the
Arian teaching—is adduced, together with that of Isaiah and St. John.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xviii-p2"></span>108. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.iii.xviii-p2.1"></span>Hence</span> it is that Christ is not
only God, but very God indeed—very God of very God, insomuch that He
Himself is the Truth. <span id="fr_1857"></span>[1858](#fn_1857.md) If,
then, we enquire His Name, it is “the Truth;” if we seek to know His
natural rank and dignity, He is so truly the very Son of God, that He is
indeed God’s *own* Son; as it is written, “Who spared not His own Son,
but gave Him up for our sakes,” <span
id="fr_1858"></span>[1859](#fn_1858.md) gave Him up, that is, so far as the
flesh was concerned. That He is God’s own Son declares His Godhead; that
He is very God shows that He is God’s own Son; His pitifulness is the
earnest of His submission, His sacrifice, of our salvation.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xviii-p5"></span>109. Lest, however, men should
wrest the Scripture, that “God gave Him up,” the Apostle himself has
said in another place, <span id="fr_1859"></span>[1860](#fn_1859.md) “Peace
from God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, Who gave Himself for our
sins;” and again: <span id="fr_1860"></span>[1861](#fn_1860.md) “Even as
Christ hath loved us, and given Himself for us.” If, then, He both was
given up by the Father, and gave Himself up of His own accord, it is
plain that the working and the will of Father and Son is one.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xviii-p8"></span>110. If, then, we enquire into His
natural pre-eminence, we find it to consist in being begotten. To deny
that the Son of God is begotten \[of God\] is to deny that He is God’s
*own* Son, and to deny Christ to be God’s own Son is to class Him with
the rest of mankind, as no more a Son than any of the rest. If, however,
we enquire into the distinctive property of His generation, it is this,
that He came forth from God. For whilst, in our experience, to come out
implies something already existent, and that which is said to come out
seems to proceed forth from hidden and inward places, we, though it be
presented but in short passages, observe the peculiar attribute of the
Divine Generation, that the Son doth not seem to have come forth out of
any place, but as God from God, a Son from a Father, nor to have had a
beginning in the course of time, having come forth from the Father by
being born, as He Himself Who was born said: “I came forth from the
mouth of the Most High.” <span id="fr_1861"></span>[1862](#fn_1861.md)

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xviii-p10"></span>111. But if the Arians acknowledge
not the Son’s nature, if they believe not the Scriptures, let them at
least believe the mighty works. To whom doth the Father say, “Let *us*
make man?” <span id="fr_1862"></span>[1863](#fn_1862.md) save to Him Whom
He knew to be His true Son? In Whom, save in one who was true, could He
recognize His Image? The son by adoption is not the same as the true
Son; nor would the Son say, “I and the Father are one,” <span
id="fr_1863"></span>[1864](#fn_1863.md) if He, being Himself not true, were
measuring Himself with One Who is true. The Father, therefore, says,
“Let us make.” He Who spake is true; can He, then, Who made be not true?
Shall the honour rendered to Him Who speaks be withheld from Him Who
makes?

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xviii-p13"></span>112. But how, unless the Father
knew Him to be His true Son, should He commend to Him His will, for
perfect co-operation, and His works, for perfect bringing in out in
actuality? Seeing that the Son worketh the works which the Father doeth,
and that the Son quickens whom He will, <span
id="fr_1864"></span>[1865](#fn_1864.md) as it is written, He is then equal
in power and free in respect of His will. And thus is the Unity
maintained, forasmuch as God’s power consists in that the Godhead is
proper to each Person, and freedom lies not in any difference, but in
unity of will.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xviii-p15"></span>113. The apostles, being
storm-tossed in the sea, as soon as they saw the waters leaping up round
their Lord’s feet, and beheld His fearless footsteps on the water, as He
walked amid the raging waves of the sea, and the ship, which was beaten
upon by the waves, had rest as soon as Christ entered it, and they saw
the waves and the winds obeying Him,—then, though as yet they did not
believe in their hearts they believed Him to be God’s true Son, saying,
“Truly Thou art the Son of God.” <span
id="fr_1865"></span>[1866](#fn_1865.md)

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xviii-p17"></span>114. To the same effect the
confession of the centurion, and others who were with him, when the
foundations of the world were shaken at the Lord’s Passion,—and this,
heretic, thou deniest! The centurion said, “Truly this was the Son of
God.” <span id="fr_1866"></span>[1867](#fn_1866.md) “Was” said the
centurion—“Was *not*” says the Arian. The centurion, then, with
bloodstained hands, but devout mind, <span id="page_220">p. 220</span>
<span id="iv.iv.iii.xviii-Page_220"></span>declares both the truth and
the eternity of Christ’s generation; and thou, O heretic, deniest its
truth, and makest it matter of time! Would that thou hadst imbued thy
hands rather than thy soul! But thou, unclean even of hand, and
murderous of intent, seekest Christ’s death, so far as in thee lies,
seeing that thou thinkest of Him as mean and weak; nay, and this is a
worse sin, thou, albeit the Godhead can feel no wound, still wouldst do
thy diligence to slay in Christ, not His Body, but His Glory.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xviii-p19"></span>115. We cannot then doubt that He
is very God, Whose true Godhead even executioners believed in and devils
confessed. Their testimony we require not now, but it is withal greater
than your blasphemies. We have called them in to witness, to put you to
the blush, whilst we have also cited the oracles of God, to the end that
you should believe.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xviii-p20"></span>116. The Lord proclaimeth by the
mouth of Isaiah: “In the mouth of them that serve Me shall a new name be
called upon, which shall be blessed over all the earth, and they shall
bless the true God, and they who swear upon earth shall swear by the
true God.” <span id="fr_1867"></span>[1868](#fn_1867.md) These words, I
say, Isaiah spake when he saw God’s Glory, and thus in the Gospel it is
plainly said that he saw the Glory of Christ and spoke of Him. <span
id="fr_1868"></span>[1869](#fn_1868.md)

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xviii-p23"></span>117. But hear again what John the
Evangelist hath written in his Epistle, saying: “We know that the Son of
God hath appeared, and hath given us discernment, to know the Father,
and to be in His true Son Jesus Christ, our Lord. He is very God, and
Life Eternal.” <span id="fr_1869"></span>[1870](#fn_1869.md) John calls Him
true Son of God and very God. If, then, He be very God, He is surely
uncreate, without spot of lying or deceit, having in Himself no
confusion, nor unlikeness to His Father.

[Next: Chapter XVIII. The errors of the Arians are mentioned in the
Nicene Definition of the Faith, to prevent their deceiving anybody.
These errors are recited, together with the anathema pronounced against
them, which is said to have been not only pronounced at Nicæa, but also
twice renewed at Ariminum.](2100201.md)
