<span id="iv.iv.vi.iv"></span>

#### <span id="iv.iv.vi.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.

<span id="iv.iv.vi.iv-p1"></span>The passage quoted adversely by
heretics, namely, “The Son can do nothing of Himself,” is first
explained from the words which follow; then, the text being examined,
word by word, their acceptation in the Arian sense is shown to be
impossible without incurring the charge of impiety or absurdity, the
proof resting chiefly on the creation of the world and certain miracles
of Christ.

<span id="iv.iv.vi.iv-p2"></span>39. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.vi.iv-p2.1"></span>Again</span>, another objection that the
Arians bring up, denying that the Power of the Father and the Son can be
one and the same, is rested on His saying: “Verily, verily, I say unto
you; the Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He hath seen the Father
doing.” <span id="fr_2359"></span>[2360](#fn_2359) And therefore they
affirm that the Son has done nothing of Himself, and can do nothing,
save what He hath seen the Father doing.

<span id="iv.iv.vi.iv-p4"></span>40. O wise foreknowledge of the
arguments of unbelievers, which made further provision of means whereby
to answer questions, by adding the words that follow: “For whatsoever
the Father doeth, the same doeth the Son also, in like fashion,” <span
id="fr_2360"></span>[2361](#fn_2360) for this indeed is the sequel. Why,
then, is it written: “The Son doeth the same things,” and not “such like
things,” but that thou mightest judge that in the Son there is unity in
the Father’s works, not imitation of them?

<span id="iv.iv.vi.iv-p6"></span>41. But to put their proofs in turn
upon trial: I would have them answer the question, whether the Son sees
the works of the Father. Does He see, I ask, or not? If He sees them,
then He also does them; if He does them, let heretics cease to deny the
omnipotence of Him Whom they confess able to do all things that He has
seen the Father doing.

<span id="iv.iv.vi.iv-p7"></span>42. But what are we to understand by
“hath seen”? Has the Son any need of bodily eyes? Nay, if they will
affirm this of the Son, they will make out in the Father also a need of
bodily activity, <span id="fr_2361"></span>[2362](#fn_2361) in order
that the Son may see that which He Himself is to do.

<span id="iv.iv.vi.iv-p9"></span>43. Furthermore, what mean the words:
“The Son can do nothing of Himself”? Let us put this question, and
debate it. Now is there anything impossible to God’s Power and Wisdom?
These, observe, are names of the Son of God, Whose Might is certainly
not a gift received from another, but just as He is the Life, <span
id="fr_2362"></span>[2363](#fn_2362) not depending upon another’s
quickening action, but Himself quickening others, because He is the
Life; so also He is Wisdom, <span id="fr_2363"></span>[2364](#fn_2363)
not as one that is ignorant acquiring wisdom, but making others wise
from His own store; so, too, He is Power, <span
id="fr_2364"></span>[2365](#fn_2364) not as having through weakness
obtained increase of strength, but being Himself Power, and bestowing
power upon the strong.

<span id="iv.iv.vi.iv-p13"></span>44. How, then, does Power assert, as
it were, under oath: “Verily, verily I say unto you,” which means: “Of a
truth, of a truth, I tell you”? <span
id="fr_2365"></span>[2366](#fn_2365) Truly, then, Thou speakest, Lord
Jesus, and dost affirm, repeating indeed thy solemn declaration, that
Thou canst do nothing, save what Thou hast seen the Father doing. Thou
didst make the universe. Did Thy Father then make another universe, for
Thee to take as a model? So must Thy blasphemers confess that there are
two, or a multitude of universes, as philosophers affirm, and thus also
entangle themselves in this heathen error, <span
id="fr_2366"></span>[2367](#fn_2366) or, if they will follow the truth,
let them say that what Thou hast made, Thou didst make, without any
pattern.

<span id="iv.iv.vi.iv-p16"></span>45. Tell me, Lord, when Thou sawest
Thy Father incarnate, and walking upon the sea, for I know not, I hold
it impious to believe this thing of the Father, knowing that Thou only
hast taken our flesh upon Thee. When sawest Thou the Father at a
marriage-feast, turning water into wine? <span
id="fr_2367"></span>[2368](#fn_2367) Nay, but I have read that Thou
alone art the only Son, begotten of the Father. I have been taught that
Thou alone, in the mystery of the Incarnation, wast born of the Holy
Ghost and the Virgin. The things, then, which we have cited as Thy
doings, the Father did not, but Thou alone, without guidance of any work
done by Thy Father, for the purchase of the world’s salvation with Thy
Blood, didst come forth spotless from the Virgin’s womb.

<span id="iv.iv.vi.iv-p18"></span>46. When they say, “The Son can do
nothing of Himself,” they indeed except nothing, so that one blasphemer
has even said: “He cannot make even a gnat,” <span
id="fr_2368"></span>[2369](#fn_2368) <span id="page_268">p. 268</span>
<span id="iv.iv.vi.iv-Page_268"></span>mocking with so headstrong
profanity and with insolence so overweening the majesty of Supreme
Power; yet perhaps they may think the mystery of Thine Incarnate Life a
needful exception. But say, Lord Jesu, what earth the Father made
without Thee. For without Thee He made no heaven, seeing that it is
written: “By the Word of the Lord were the heavens established.”

<span id="iv.iv.vi.iv-p20"></span>47. But neither did the Father make
the earth without Thee, for it is written: “All things were made by Him,
and without Him was not anything made.” <span
id="fr_2369"></span>[2370](#fn_2369) For if the Father made aught
without Thee, God the Word, then not all things were made by the Word,
and the Evangelist lies. Whereas if all things were made by the Word,
and if by Thee all things begin to be, which before were not, then
surely Thou Thyself, of Thyself, hast made what Thou didst not see made
by the Father; though perchance our adversaries may have recourse to
that theory of Plato, and place before Thee the ideas supposed by
philosophers, which, indeed, we know have been exploded by philosophers
themselves. On the other hand, if Thou Thyself hast of Thyself made all
things, vain are the assertions of the unbelieving, which ascribe
progress in learning to the Maker of all, Who of Himself supplies the
teaching of His craft.

<span id="iv.iv.vi.iv-p22"></span>48. But if heretics deny that either
the heavens or the earth were made by Thee, let them take heed into what
a gulf they are by their own madness hurling themselves, seeing that it
is written: “Perish the gods, which have not made heaven and
earth.” <span id="fr_2370"></span>[2371](#fn_2370) Shall He then perish,
O Arian, Who has found and saved that which had perished? But to
purpose.

[Next: Chapter V. Continuing the exposition of the disputed passage,
which he had begun, Ambrose brings forward four reasons why we affirm
that something cannot be, and shows that the first three fail to apply
to Christ, and infers that the only reason why the Son can do nothing of
Himself is His Unity in Power with the Father.](2100245)
