[Dogmatic Treatises, Ethical Works, and Sermons.](2100009)  
[On the Duties of the Clergy.](2100010)  
[Introduction.](2100011)  
[Book I.](2100012)  
[Chapter I. A Bishop's special office is to teach; St. Ambrose himself,
however, has to learn in order that he may teach; or rather has to teach
what he has not learnt; at any rate learning and teaching with himself
must go on together.](2100013)  
[Chapter II. Manifold dangers are incurred by speaking; the remedy for
which Scripture shows to consist in silence.](2100014)  
[Chapter III. Silence should not remain unbroken, nor should it arise
from idleness. How heart and mouth must be guarded against inordinate
affections.](2100015)  
[Chapter IV. The same care must be taken that our speech proceed not
from evil passions, but from good motives; for here it is that the devil
is especially on the watch to catch us.](2100016)  
[Chapter V. We must guard also against a visible enemy when he incites
us by silence; by the help of which alone we can escape from those
greater than ourselves, and maintain that humility which we must display
towards all.](2100017)  
[Chapter VI. In this matter we must imitate David's silence and
humility, so as not even to seem deserving of harm.](2100018)  
[Chapter VII. How admirably Ps. xxxix. \[xxxviii.\] takes the place of
an introduction. Incited thereto by this psalm the saint determines to
write on duties. He does this with more reason even than Cicero, who
wrote on this subject to his son. How, further, this is so.](2100019)  
[Chapter VIII. The word “Duty” has been often used both by philosophers
and in the holy Scriptures; from whence it is derived.](2100020)  
[Chapter IX. A duty is to be chosen from what is virtuous, and from what
is useful, and also from the comparison of the two, one with the other;
but nothing is recognized by Christians as virtuous or useful which is
not helpful to the future life. This treatise on duty, therefore, will
not be superfluous.](2100021)  
[Chapter X. What is seemly is often found in the sacred writings long
before it appears in the books of the philosophers. Pythagoras borrowed
the law of his silence from David. David's rule, however, is the best,
for our first duty is to have due measure in speaking.](2100022)  
[Chapter XI. It is proved by the witness of Scripture that all duty is
either “ordinary” or “perfect.” To which is added a word in praise of
mercy, and an exhortation to practise it.](2100023)  
[Chapter XII. To prevent any one from being checked in the exercise of
mercy, he shows that God cares for human actions; and proves on the
evidence of Job that all wicked men are unhappy in the very abundance of
their wealth.](2100024)  
[Chapter XIII. The ideas of those philosophers are refuted who deny to
God the care of the whole world, or of any of its parts.](2100025)  
[Chapter XIV. Nothing escapes God's knowledge. This is proved by the
witness of the Scriptures and the analogy of the sun, which, although
created, yet by its light or heat enters into all things.](2100026)  
[Chapter XV. Those who are dissatisfied with the fact that the good
receive evil, and the evil good, are shown by the example of Lazarus,
and on the authority of Paul, that punishments and rewards are reserved
for a future life.](2100027)  
[Chapter XVI. To confirm what has been said above about rewards and
punishments, he adds that it is not strange if there is no reward
reserved for some in the future; for they do not labour here nor
struggle. He goes on to say also that for this reason temporal goods are
granted to these persons, so that they may have no excuse
whatever.](2100028)  
[Chapter XVII. The duties of youth, and examples suitable to that age,
are next put forth.](2100029)  
[Chapter XVIII. On the different functions of modesty. How it should
qualify both speech and silence, accompany chastity, commend our prayers
to God, govern our bodily motions; on which last point reference is made
to two clerics in language by no means unsuited to its object. Further
he proceeds to say that one's gait should be in accordance with that
same virtue, and how careful one must be that nothing immodest come
forth from one's mouth, or be noticed in one's body. All these points
are illustrated with very appropriate examples.](2100030)  
[Chapter XIX. How should seemliness be represented by a speaker? Does
beauty add anything to virtue, and, if so, how much? Lastly, what care
should we take that nothing conceited or effeminate be seen in
us?](2100031)  
[Chapter XX. If we are to preserve our modesty we must avoid fellowship
with profligate men, also the banquets of strangers, and intercourse
with women; our leisure time at home should be spent in pious and
virtuous pursuits.](2100032)  
[Chapter XXI. We must guard against anger, before it arises; if it has
already arisen we must check and calm it, and if we cannot do this
either, at least we should keep our tongue from abuse, so that our
passions may be like boys' quarrels. He relates what Archites said, and
shows that David led the way in this matter, both in his actions and in
his writings.](2100033)  
[Chapter XXII. On reflection and passion, and on observing propriety of
speech, both in ordinary conversation and in holding
discussions.](2100034)  
[Chapter XXIII. Jests, although at times they may be quite proper,
should be altogether banished among clerics. The voice should be plain
and frank.](2100035)  
[Chapter XXIV. There are three things to be noticed in the actions of
our life. First, our passions are to be controlled by our reason; next,
we ought to observe a suitable moderation in our desires; and, lastly,
everything ought to be done at the right time and in the proper order.
All these qualities shone forth so conspicuously in the holy men of Old
Testament time, that it is evident they were well furnished with what
men call the cardinal virtues.](2100036)  
[Chapter XXV. A reason is given why this book did not open with a
discussion of the above-mentioned virtues. It is also concisely pointed
out that the same virtues existed in the ancient fathers.](2100037)  
[Chapter XXVI. In investigating the truth the philosophers have broken
through their own rules. Moses, however, showed himself more wise than
they. The greater the dignity of wisdom, the more earnestly must we
strive to gain it. Nature herself urges us all to do this.](2100038)  
[Chapter XXVII. The first source of duty is prudence, from whence spring
three other virtues; and they cannot be separated or torn asunder, since
they are mutually connected one with the other.](2100039)  
[Chapter XXVIII. A community rests upon justice and good-will. Two parts
of the former, revenge and private possession, are not recognized by
Christians. What the Stoics say about common property and mutual help
has been borrowed from the sacred writings. The greatness of the glory
of justice, and what hinders access to it.](2100040)  
[Chapter XXIX. Justice should be observed even in war and with enemies.
This is proved by the example of Moses and Elisha. The ancient writers
learnt in turn from the Hebrews to call their enemies by a gentler term.
Lastly, the foundation of justice rests on faith, and its symmetry is
perfect in the Church.](2100041)  
[Chapter XXX. On kindness and its several parts, namely, good-will and
liberality. How they are to be combined. What else is further needed for
any one to show liberality in a praiseworthy manner.](2100042)  
[Chapter XXXI. A kindness received should be returned with a freer hand.
This is shown by the example of the earth. A passage from Solomon about
feasting is adduced to prove the same, and is expounded later in a
spiritual sense.](2100043)  
[Chapter XXXII. After saying what return must be made for the service of
the above-mentioned feast, various reasons for repaying kindness are
enumerated. Then he speaks in praise of good-will, on its results and
its order.](2100044)  
[Chapter XXXIII. Good-will exists especially in the Church, and
nourishes kindred virtues.](2100045)  
[Chapter XXXIV. Some other advantages of goodwill are here
enumerated.](2100046)  
[Chapter XXXV. On fortitude. This is divided into two parts: as it
concerns matters of war and matters at home. The first cannot be a
virtue unless combined with justice and prudence. The other depends to a
large extent upon endurance.](2100047)  
[Chapter XXXVI. One of the duties of fortitude is to keep the weak from
receiving injury; another, to check the wrong motions of our own souls;
a third, both to disregard humiliations, and to do what is right with an
even mind. All these clearly ought to be fulfilled by all Christians,
and especially by the clergy.](2100048)  
[Chapter XXXVII. An even mind should be preserved in adversity as well
as in prosperity. However, evil things must be avoided.](2100049)  
[Chapter XXXVIII. We must strengthen the mind against troubles to come,
and build it up by looking out for them beforehand. What difficulties
there are in doing this.](2100050)  
[Chapter XXXIX. One must show fortitude in fighting against all vices,
especially against avarice. Holy Job teaches this lesson.](2100051)  
[Chapter XL. Courage in war was not wanting in our forefathers, as is
shown by the example of the men of old, especially by the glorious deed
of Eleazar.](2100052)  
[Chapter XLI. After praising Judas' and Jonathan's loftiness of mind,
the constancy of the martyrs in their endurance of tortures, which is no
small part of fortitude, is next brought before us.](2100053)  
[Chapter XLII. The powers that be are not needlessly to be irritated.
One must not lend one's ears to flattery.](2100054)  
[Chapter XLIII. On temperance and its chief parts, especially
tranquillity of mind and moderation, care for what is virtuous, and
reflection on what is seemly.](2100055)  
[Chapter XLIV. Every one ought to apply himself to the duties suited to
his character. Many, however, are hindered by following their fathers'
pursuits. Clerics act in a different way.](2100056)  
[Chapter XLV. On what is noble and virtuous, and what the difference
between them is, as stated both in the profane and sacred
writers.](2100057)  
[Chapter XLVI. A twofold division of what is seemly is given. Next it is
shown that what is according to nature is virtuous, and what is
otherwise must be looked on as shameful. This division is explained by
examples.](2100058)  
[Chapter XLVII. What is seemly should always shine forth in our life.
What passions, then, ought we to allow to come to a head, and which
should we restrain?](2100059)  
[Chapter XLVIII. The argument for restraining anger is given again. Then
the three classes of those who receive wrongs are set forth; to the most
perfect of which the Apostle and David are said to have attained. He
takes the opportunity to state the difference between this and the
future life.](2100060)  
[Chapter XLIX. We must reserve the likeness of the virtues in ourselves.
The likeness of the devil and of vice must be got rid of, and especially
that of avarice; for this deprives us of liberty, and despoils those who
are in the midst of vanities of the image of God.](2100061)  
[Chapter L. The Levites ought to be utterly free from all earthly
desires. What their virtues should be on the Apostle's own showing, and
how great their purity must be. Also what their dignity and duty is, for
the carrying out of which the chief virtues are necessary. He states
that these were not unknown to the philosophers, but that they erred in
their order. Some are by their nature in accordance with duty, which yet
on account of what accompanies them become contrary to duty. From whence
he gathers what gifts the office of the Levites demands. To conclude, he
adds an exposition of Moses' words when blessing the tribe of
Levi.](2100062)  
[Book II.](2100063)  
[Chapter I. Happiness in life is to be gained by living virtuously,
inasmuch as thus a Christian, whilst despising glory and the favour of
men, desires to please God alone in what he does.](2100064)  
[Chapter II. The different ideas of philosophers on the subject of
happiness. He proves, first, from the Gospel that it rests on the
knowledge of God and the pursuit of good works; next, that it may not be
thought that this idea was adopted from the philosophers, he adds proofs
from the witness of the prophets.](2100065)  
[Chapter III. The definition of blessedness as drawn from the Scriptures
is considered and proved. It cannot be enhanced by external good
fortune, nor can it be weakened by misfortune.](2100066)  
[Chapter IV. The same argument, namely, that blessedness is not lessened
or added to by external matters, is illustrated by the example of men of
old.](2100067)  
[Chapter V. Those things which are generally looked on as good are
mostly hindrances to a blessed life, and those which are looked on as
evil are the materials out of which virtues grow. What belongs to
blessedness is shown by other examples.](2100068)  
[Chapter VI. On what is useful: not that which is advantageous, but that
which is just and virtuous. It is to be found in losses, and is divided
into what is useful for the body, and what is useful unto
godliness.](2100069)  
[Chapter VII. What is useful is the same as what is virtuous; nothing is
more useful than love, which is gained by gentleness, courtesy,
kindness, justice, and the other virtues, as we are given to understand
from the histories of Moses and David. Lastly, confidence springs from
love, and again love from confidence.](2100070)  
[Chapter VIII. Nothing has greater effect in gaining good-will than
giving advice; but none can trust it unless it rests on justice and
prudence. How conspicuous these two virtues were in Solomon is shown by
his well-known judgment.](2100071)  
[Chapter IX. Though justice and prudence are inseparable, we must have
respect to the ideas of people in general, for they make a distinction
between the different cardinal virtues.](2100072)  
[Chapter X. Men entrust their safety rather to a just than to a prudent
man. But every one is wont to seek out the man who combines in himself
the qualities of justice and prudence. Solomon gives us an example of
this. (The words which the queen of Sheba spoke of him are explained.)
Also Daniel and Joseph.](2100073)  
[Chapter XI. A third element which tends to gain any one's confidence is
shown to have been conspicuous in Moses, Daniel, and Joseph.](2100074)  
[Chapter XII. No one asks counsel from a man tainted with vice, or from
one who is morose or impracticable, but rather from one of whom we have
a pattern in the Scriptures.](2100075)  
[Chapter XIII. The beauty of wisdom is made plain by the divine
testimony. From this he goes on to prove its connection with the other
virtues.](2100076)  
[Chapter XIV. Prudence is combined with all the virtues, especially with
contempt of riches.](2100077)  
[Chapter XV. Of liberality. To whom it must chiefly be shown, and how
men of slender means may show it by giving their service and
counsel.](2100078)  
[Chapter XVI. Due measure must be observed in liberality, that it may
not be expended on worthless persons, when it is needed by worthier
ones. However, alms are not to be given in too sparing and hesitating a
way. One ought rather to follow the example of the blessed Joseph, whose
prudence is commended at great length.](2100079)  
[Chapter XVII. What virtues ought to exist in him whom we consult. How
Joseph and Paul were equipped with them.](2100080)  
[Chapter XVIII. We learn from the fact of the separation of the ten
tribes from King Rehoboam what harm bad counsellors can do.](2100081)  
[Chapter XIX. Many are won by justice and benevolence and courtesy, but
all this must be sincere.](2100082)  
[Chapter XX. Familiarity with good men is very advantageous to all,
especially to the young, as is shown by the example of Joshua and Moses
and others. Further, those who are unlike in age are often alike in
virtues, as Peter and John prove.](2100083)  
[Chapter XXI. To defend the weak, or to help strangers, or to perform
similar duties, greatly adds to one's worth, especially in the case of
tried men. Whilst one gets great blame for love of money; wastefulness,
also, in the case of priests is very much condemned.](2100084)  
[Chapter XXII. We must observe a right standard between too great
mildness and excessive harshness. They who endeavour to creep into the
hearts of others by a false show of mildness gain nothing substantial or
lasting. This the example of Absalom plainly enough shows.](2100085)  
[Chapter XXIII. The good faith of those who are easily bought over with
money or flattery is a frail thing to trust to.](2100086)  
[Chapter XXIV. We must strive for preferment only by right means. An
office undertaken must be carried out wisely and with moderation. The
inferior clergy should not detract from the bishop's reputation by
feigned virtues; nor again, should the bishop be jealous of a cleric,
but he should be just in all things and especially in giving
judgment.](2100087)  
[Chapter XXV. Benefits should be conferred on the poor rather than on
the rich, for these latter either think a return is expected from them,
or else they are angry at seeming to be indebted for such an action. But
the poor man makes God the debtor in his place, and freely owns to the
benefits he has received. To these remarks is added a warning to despise
riches.](2100088)  
[Chapter XXVI. How long standing an evil love of money is, is plain from
many examples in the Old Testament. And yet it is plain, too, how idle a
thing the possession of money is.](2100089)  
[Chapter XXVII. In contempt of money there is the pattern of justice,
which virtue bishops and clerics ought to aim at together with some
others. A few words are added on the duty of not bringing an
excommunication too quickly into force.](2100090)  
[Chapter XXVIII. Mercy must be freely shown even though it brings an
odium of its own. With regard to this, reference is made to the
well-known story about the sacred vessels which were broken up by
Ambrose to pay for the redemption of captives; and very beautiful advice
is given about the right use of the gold and silver which the Church
possesses. Next, after showing from the action of holy Lawrence what are
the true treasures of the Church, certain rules are laid down which
ought to be observed in melting down and employing for such uses the
consecrated vessels of the Church.](2100091)  
[Chapter XXIX. The property of widows or of all the faithful, that has
been entrusted to the Church, ought to be defended though it brings
danger to oneself. This is illustrated by the example of Onias the
priest, and of Ambrose, bishop of Ticinum.](2100092)  
[Chapter XXX. The ending of the book brings an exhortation to avoid
ill-will, and to seek prudence, faith, and the other
virtues.](2100093)  
[Book III.](2100094)  
[Chapter I. We are taught by David and Solomon how to take counsel with
our own heart. Scipio is not to be accounted prime author of the saying
which is ascribed to him. The writer proves what glorious things the
holy prophets accomplished in their time of quiet, and shows, by
examples of their and others' leisure moments, that a just man is never
alone in trouble.](2100095)  
[Chapter II. The discussions among philosophers about the comparison
between what is virtuous and what is useful have nothing to do with
Christians. For with them nothing is useful which is not just. What are
the duties of perfection, and what are ordinary duties? The same words
often suit different things in different ways. Lastly, a just man never
seeks his own advantage at the cost of another's disadvantage, but
rather is always on the lookout for what is useful to
others.](2100096)  
[Chapter III. The rule given about not seeking one's own gain is
established, first by the examples of Christ, next by the meaning of the
word, and lastly by the very form and uses of our limbs. Wherefore the
writer shows what a crime it is to deprive another of what is useful,
since the law of nature as well as the divine law is broken by such
wickedness. Further, by its means we also lose that gift which makes us
superior to other living creatures; and lastly, through it civil laws
are abused and treated with the greatest contempt.](2100097)  
[Chapter IV. As it has been shown that he who injures another for the
sake of his own advantage will undergo terrible punishment at the hand
of his own conscience, it is referred that nothing is useful to one
which is not in the same way useful to all. Thus there is no place among
Christians for the question propounded by the philosophers about two
shipwrecked persons, for they must show love and humility to
all.](2100098)  
[Chapter V. The upright does nothing that is contrary to duty, even
though there is a hope of keeping it secret. To point this out the tale
about the ring of Gyges was invented by the philosophers. Exposing this,
he brings forward known and true examples from the life of David and
John the Baptist.](2100099)  
[Chapter VI. We ought not to allow the idea of profit to get hold of us.
What excuses they make who get their gains by selling corn, and what
answer ought to be made to them. In connection with this certain
parables from the Gospels and some of the sayings of Solomon are set
before our eyes.](2100100)  
[Chapter VII. Strangers must never be expelled the city in a time of
famine. In this matter the noble advice of a Christian sage is adduced,
in contrast to which the shameful deed committed at Rome is given. By
comparing the two it is shown that the former is combined with what is
virtuous and useful, but the latter with neither.](2100101)  
[Chapter VIII. That those who put what is virtuous before what is useful
are acceptable to God is shown by the example of Joshua, Caleb, and the
other spies.](2100102)  
[Chapter IX. Cheating and dishonest ways of making money are utterly
unfit for clerics whose duty is to serve all. They ought never to be
involved in a money affair, unless it is one affecting a man's life. For
them the example of David is given, that they should injure none, even
when provoked; also the death of Naboth, to keep them from preferring
life to virtue.](2100103)  
[Chapter X. We are warned not only in civil law, but also in the holy
Scriptures, to avoid fraud in every agreement, as is clear from the
example of Joshua and the Gibeonites.](2100104)  
[Chapter XI. Having adduced examples of certain frauds found in a few
passages of the rhetoricians, he shows that these and all others are
more fully and plainly condemned in Scripture.](2100105)  
[Chapter XII. We may make no promise that is wrong, and if we have made
an unjust oath, we may not keep it. It is shown that Herod sinned in
this respect. The vow taken by Jephtha is condemned, and so are all
others which God does not desire to have paid to Him. Lastly, the
daughter of Jephtha is compared with the two Pythagoreans and is placed
before them.](2100106)  
[Chapter XIII. Judith, after enduring many dangers for virtue's sake,
gained very many and great benefits.](2100107)  
[Chapter XIV. How virtuous and useful was that which Elisha did. This is
compared with that oft-recounted act of the Greeks. John gave up his
life for virtue's sake, and Susanna for the same reason exposed herself
to the danger of death.](2100108)  
[Chapter XV. After mentioning a noble action of the Romans, the writer
shows from the deeds of Moses that he had the greatest regard for what
is virtuous.](2100109)  
[Chapter XVI. After saying a few words about Tobit he demonstrates that
Raguel surpassed the philosophers in virtue.](2100110)  
[Chapter XVII. With what virtuous feelings the fathers of old hid the
sacred fires when on the point of going into captivity.](2100111)  
[Chapter XVIII. In the narration of that event already mentioned, and
especially of the sacrifice offered by Nehemiah, is typified the Holy
Spirit and Christian baptism. The sacrifice of Moses and Elijah and the
history of Noah are also referred to the same.](2100112)  
[Chapter XIX. The crime committed by the inhabitants of Gibeah against
the wife of a certain Levite is related, and from the vengeance taken it
is inferred how the idea of virtue must have filled the heart of those
people of old.](2100113)  
[Chapter XX. After the terrible siege of Samaria was ended in accordance
with Elisha's prophecy, he relates what regard the four lepers showed
for what was virtuous.](2100114)  
[Chapter XXI. Esther in danger of her life followed the grace of virtue;
nay, even a heathen king did so, when death was threatened to a man most
friendly to him. For friendship must ever be combined with virtue, as
the examples of Jonathan and Ahimelech show.](2100115)  
[Chapter XXII. Virtue must never be given up for the sake of a friend.
If, however, one has to bear witness against a friend, it must be done
with caution. Between friends what candour is needed in opening the
heart, what magnanimity in suffering, what freedom in finding fault!
Friendship is the guardian of virtues, which are not to be found but in
men of like character. It must be mild in rebuking and averse to seeking
its own advantage; whence it happens that true friends are scarce among
the rich. What is the dignity of friendship? The treachery of a friend,
as it is worse, so it is also more hateful than another's, as is
recognized from the example of Judas and of Job's friends.](2100116)  
[On the Holy Spirit.](2100117)  
[Introduction.](2100118)  
[Book I.](2100119)  
[Preface.](2100120)  
[Chapter I. St. Ambrose commences his argument by complimenting the
Emperor, both for his faith and for the restitution of the Basilica to
the Church; then having urged that his opponents, if they affirm that
the Holy Spirit is not a servant, cannot deny Him to be above all, adds
that the same Spirit, when He said, “All things serve Thee,” showed
plainly that He was distinct from creatures; which point he also
establishes by other evidence.](2100121)  
[Chapter II. The words, “All things were made by Him,” are not a proof
that the Holy Spirit is included amongst all things, since He was not
made. For otherwise it could be proved by other passages that the Son,
and even the Father Himself, must be numbered amongst all things, which
would be similar irreverence.](2100122)  
[Chapter III. The statement of the Apostle, that all things are of the
Father by the Son, does not separate the Spirit from Their company,
since what is referred to one Person is also attributed to each. So
those baptized in the Name of Christ are held to be baptized in the Name
of the Father and of the Holy Spirit, if, that is, there is belief in
the Three Persons, otherwise the baptism will be null. This also applies
to baptism in the Name of the Holy Spirit. If because of one passage the
Holy Spirit is separated from the Father and the Son, it will
necessarily follow from other passages that the Father will be
subordinated to the Son. The Son is worshipped by angels, not by the
Spirit, for the latter is His witness, not His servant. Where the Son is
spoken of as being before all, it is to be understood of creatures. The
great dignity of the Holy Spirit is proved by the absence of forgiveness
for the sin against Him. How it is that such sin cannot be forgiven, and
how the Spirit is one.](2100123)  
[Chapter IV. The Holy Spirit is one and the same Who spake in the
prophets and apostles, Who is the Spirit of God and of Christ; Whom,
further, Scripture designates the Paraclete, and the Spirit of life and
truth.](2100124)  
[Chapter V. The Holy Spirit, since He sanctifies creatures, is neither a
creature nor subject to change. He is always good, since He is given by
the Father and the Son; neither is He to be numbered amongst such things
as are said to fail. He must be acknowledged as the source of goodness.
The Spirit of God's mouth, the amender of evils, and Himself good.
Lastly, as He is said in Scripture to be good, and is joined to the
Father and the Son in baptism, He cannot possibly be denied to be good.
He is not, however, said to progress, but to be made perfect in
goodness, which distinguishes Him from all creatures.](2100125)  
[Chapter VI. Although we are baptized with water and the Spirit, the
latter is much superior to the former, and is not therefore to be
separated from the Father and the Son.](2100126)  
[Chapter VII. The Holy Spirit is not a creature, seeing that He is
infinite, and was shed upon the apostles dispersed through all
countries, and moreover sanctifies the Angels also, to whom He makes us
equal. Mary was full of the same likewise, so too, Christ the Lord, and
so far all things high and low. And all benediction has its origin from
His operation, as was signified in the moving of the water at
Bethesda.](2100127)  
[Chapter VIII. The Holy Spirit is given by God alone, yet not wholly to
each person, since there is no one besides Christ capable of receiving
Him wholly. Charity is shed abroad by the Holy Spirit, Who, prefigured
by the mystical ointment, is shown to have nothing common with
creatures; and He, inasmuch as He is said to proceed from the mouth of
God, must not be classed with creatures, nor with things divisible,
seeing He is eternal.](2100128)  
[Chapter IX. The Holy Spirit is rightly called the ointment of Christ,
and the oil of gladness; and why Christ Himself is not the ointment,
since He was anointed with the Holy Spirit. It is not strange that the
Spirit should be called Ointment, since the Father and the Son are also
called Spirit. And there is no confusion between them, since Christ
alone suffered death, Whose saving cross is then spoken of.](2100129)  
[Chapter X. That the Spirit forgives sin is common to Him with the
Father and the Son, but not with the Angels.](2100130)  
[Chapter XI. The Spirit is sent to all, and passes not from place to
place, for He is not limited either by time or space. He goes forth from
the Son, as the Son from the Father, in Whom He ever abides: and also
comes to us when we receive. He comes also after the same manner as the
Father Himself, from Whom He can by no means be separated.](2100131)  
[Chapter XII. The peace and grace of the Father, the Son, and the Holy
Spirit are one, so also is Their charity one, which showed itself
chiefly in the redemption of man. Their communion with man is also
one.](2100132)  
[Chapter XIII. St. Ambrose shows from the Scriptures that the Name of
the Three Divine Persons is one, and first the unity of the Name of the
Son and of the Holy Spirit, inasmuch as each is called Paraclete and
Truth.](2100133)  
[Chapter XIV. Each Person of the Trinity is said in the sacred writings
to be Light. The Spirit is designated Fire by Isaiah, a figure of which
Fire was seen in the bush by Moses, in the tongues of fire, and in
Gideon's pitchers. And the Godhead of the same Spirit cannot be denied,
since His operation is the same as that of the Father and of the Son,
and He is also called the light and fire of the Lord's
countenance.](2100134)  
[Chapter XV. The Holy Spirit is Life equally with the Father and the
Son, in truth whether the Father be mentioned, with Whom is the Fount of
Life, or the Son, that Fount can be none other than the Holy
Spirit.](2100135)  
[Chapter XVI. The Holy Spirit is that large river by which the mystical
Jerusalem is watered. It is equal to its Fount, that is, the Father and
the Son, as is signified in holy Scripture. St. Ambrose himself thirsts
for that water, and warns us that in order to preserve it within us, we
must avoid the devil, lust, and heresy, since our vessels are frail, and
that broken cisterns must be forsaken, that after the example of the
Samaritan woman and of the patriarchs we may find the water of the
Lord.](2100136)  
[Book II.](2100137)  
[Introduction.](2100138)  
[Chapter I. The Spirit is the Lord and Power; and in this is not
inferior to the Father and the Son.](2100139)  
[Chapter II. The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are One in
counsel.](2100140)  
[Chapter III. As to know the Father and the Son is life, so is it life
to know the Holy Spirit; and therefore in the Godhead He is not to be
separated from the Father.](2100141)  
[Chapter IV. The Holy Spirit gives life, not in a different way from the
Father and the Son, nor by a different working.](2100142)  
[Chapter V. The Holy Spirit, as well as the Father and the Son, is
pointed out in holy Scripture as Creator, and the same truth was
shadowed forth even by heathen writers, but it was shown most plainly in
the Mystery of the Incarnation, after touching upon which, the writer
maintains his argument from the fact that worship which is due to the
Creator alone is paid to the Holy Spirit.](2100143)  
[Chapter VI. To those who object that according to the words of Amos the
Spirit is created, the answer is made that the word is there understood
of the wind, which is often created, which cannot be said of the Holy
Spirit, since He is eternal, and cannot be dissolved in death, or by an
heretical absorption into the Father. But if they pertinaciously contend
that this passage was written of the Holy Spirit, St. Ambrose points out
that recourse must be had to a spiritual Interpretation, for Christ by
His coming established the thunder, that is, the force of the divine
utterances, and by Spirit is signified the human soul as also the flesh
assumed by Christ. And since this was created by each Person of the
Trinity, it is thence argued that the Spirit, Who has before been
affirmed to be the Creator of all things, was the Author of the
Incarnation of the Lord.](2100144)  
[Chapter VII. The Holy Spirit is no less the author of spiritual
creation or regeneration than the Father and the Son. The excellence of
that creation, and wherein it consists. How we are to understand holy
Scripture, when it attributes a body or members to God.](2100145)  
[Chapter VIII. St. Ambrose examines and refutes the heretical argument
that because God is said to be glorified in the Spirit, and not with the
Spirit, the Holy Spirit is therefore inferior to the Father. He shows
that the particle in can be also used of the Son and even of the Father,
and that on the other hand with may be said of creatures without any
infringement on the prerogatives of the Godhead; and that in reality
these prepositions simply imply the connection of the Three Divine
Persons.](2100146)  
[Chapter IX. A passage of St. Paul abused by heretics, to prove a
distinction between the Divine Persons, is explained, and it is proved
that the whole passage can be rightly said of each Person, though it
refers specially to the Son. It is then proved that each member of the
passage is applicable to each Person, and as to say, of Him are all
things is applicable to the Father, so may all things are through Him
and in Him also be said of Him.](2100147)  
[Chapter X. Being about to prove that the will, the calling, and the
commandment of the Trinity is one, St. Ambrose shows that the Spirit
called the Church exactly as the Father and the Son did, and proves this
by the selection of SS. Paul and Barnabas, and especially by the mission
of St. Peter to Cornelius. And by the way he points out how in the
Apostle's vision the calling of the Gentiles was shadowed forth, who
having been before like wild beasts, now by the operation of the Spirit
lay aside that wildness. Then having quoted other passages in support of
this view, he shows that in the case of Jeremiah cast into a pit by
Jews, and rescued by Abdemelech, is a type of the slighting of the Holy
Spirit by the Jews, and of His being honoured by the
Gentiles.](2100148)  
[Chapter XI. We shall follow the example of Abdemelech, if we believe
that the Son and Holy Spirit know all things. This knowledge is
attributed in Scripture to the Spirit, and also to the Son. The Son is
glorified by the Spirit, as also the Spirit by the Son. Also, inasmuch
as we read that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit say and reveal the
same things, we must acknowledge in Them a oneness of nature and
knowledge. Lastly, that the Spirit searcheth the deep things of God is
not a mark of ignorance, since the Father and the Son are likewise said
to search, and Paul, although chosen by Christ, yet was taught by the
Spirit.](2100149)  
[Chapter XII. After proof that the Spirit is the Giver of revelation
equally with the Father and the Son, it is explained how the same Spirit
does not speak of Himself; and it is shown that no bodily organs are to
be thought of in Him, and that no inferiority is to be supposed from the
fact of our reading that He hears, since the same would have to be
attributed to the Son, and indeed even to the Father, since He hears the
Son. The Spirit then hears and glorifies the Son in the sense that He
revealed Him to the prophets and apostles, by which the Unity of
operation of the Three Persons is inferred; and, since the Spirit does
the same works as the Father, the substance of each is also declared to
be the same.](2100150)  
[Chapter XIII. Prophecy was not only from the Father and the Son but
also from the Spirit; the authority and operation of the latter on the
apostles is signified to be the same as Theirs; and so we are to
understand that there is unity in the three points of authority, rule,
and bounty; yet need no disadvantage be feared from that participation,
since such does not arise in human friendship. Lastly, it is established
that this is the inheritance of the apostolic faith from the fact that
the apostles are described as having obeyed the Holy Spirit.](2100151)  
[Book III.](2100152)  
[Chapter I. Not only were the prophets and apostles sent by the Spirit,
but also the Son of God. This is proved from Isaiah and the evangelists,
and it is explained why St. Luke wrote that the same Spirit descended
like a dove upon Christ and abode upon Him. Next, after establishing
this mission of Christ, the writer infers that the Son is sent by the
Father and the Spirit, as the Spirit is by the Father and the
Son.](2100153)  
[Chapter II. The Son and the Spirit are alike given; whence not
subjection but one Godhead is shown by Its working.](2100154)  
[Chapter III. The same Unity may also be recognized from the fact that
the Spirit is called Finger, and the Son Right Hand; for the
understanding of divine things is assisted by the usage of human
language. The tables of the law were written by this Finger, and they
were afterwards broken, and the reason. Lastly, Christ wrote with the
same Finger; yet we must not admit any inferiority in the Spirit from
this bodily comparison.](2100155)  
[Chapter IV. To those who contend that the Spirit because He is called
the Finger is less than the Father, St. Ambrose replies that this would
also tend to the lessening of the Son, Who is called the Right Hand.
That these names are to be referred only to the Unity, for which reason
Moses proclaimed that the whole Trinity worked in the passage of the Red
Sea. And, indeed, it is no wonder that the operation of the Spirit found
place there, where there was a figure of baptism, since the Scripture
teaches that the Three Persons equally sanctify and are operative in
that sacrament.](2100156)  
[Chapter V. The writer sums up the argument he had commenced, and
confirms the statement that unity is signified by the terms finger and
right hand, from the fact that the works of God are the same as are the
works of hands; and that those of hands are the same as those of
fingers; and lastly, that the term hand applies equally to the Son and
the Spirit, and that of finger applies to the Spirit and the
Son.](2100157)  
[Chapter VI. The Spirit rebukes just as do the Father and the Son; and
indeed judges could not judge without Him, as is shown by the judgments
of Solomon and Daniel, which are explained in a few words, by the way;
and no other than the Holy Spirit inspired Daniel.](2100158)  
[Chapter VII. The Son Himself does not judge or punish without the
Spirit, so that the same Spirit is called the Sword of the Word. But
inasmuch as the Word is in turn called the Sword of the Spirit, the
highest unity of power is thereby recognized in each.](2100159)  
[Chapter VIII. The aforesaid unity is proved hereby, that as the Father
is said to be grieved and tempted, so too the Son. The Son was also
tempted in the wilderness, where a figure of the cross was set up in the
brazen serpent: but the Apostle says that the Spirit also was there
tempted. St. Ambrose infers from this that the Israelites were guided
into the promised land by the same Spirit, and that His will and power
are one with those of the Father and the Son.](2100160)  
[Chapter IX. That the Holy Spirit is provoked is proved by the words of
St. Peter, in which it is shown that the Spirit of God is one and the
same as the Spirit of the Lord, both by other passages and by reference
to the sentence of the same Apostle on Ananias and Sapphira, whence it
is argued that the union of the Holy Spirit with the Father and the Son,
as well as His own Godhead, is proved.](2100161)  
[Chapter X. The Divinity of the Holy Spirit is supported by a passage of
St. John. This passage was, indeed, erased by heretics, but it is a vain
attempt, since their faithlessness could thereby more easily be
convicted. The order of the context is considered in order that this
passage may be shown to refer to the Spirit. He is born of the Spirit
who is born again of the same Spirit, of Whom Christ Himself is believed
to have been born and born again. Again, the Godhead of the Spirit is
inferred from two testimonies of St. John; and lastly, it is explained
how the Spirit, the water, and the blood are called
witnesses.](2100162)  
[Chapter XI. The objection has been made, that the words of St. John,
“The Spirit is God,” are to be referred to God the Father; since Christ
afterwards declares that God is to be worshipped in Spirit and in truth.
The answer is, first, that by the word Spirit is sometimes meant
spiritual grace; next, it is shown that, if they insist that the Person
of the Holy Spirit is signified by the words “in Spirit,” and therefore
deny that adoration is due to Him, the argument tells equally against
the Son; and since numberless passages prove that He is to be
worshipped, we understand from this that the same rule is to be laid
down as regards the Spirit. Why are we commanded to fall down before His
footstool? Because by this is signified the Lord's Body, and as the
Spirit was the Maker of this, it follows that He is to be worshipped,
and yet it does not accordingly follow that Mary is to be worshipped.
Therefore the worship of the Spirit is not done away with, but His union
with the Father is ex](2100163)  
[Chapter XII. From the fact that St. Paul has shown that the light of
the Godhead which the three apostles worshipped in Christ is in the
Trinity, it is made clear that the Spirit also is to be worshipped. It
is shown from the words themselves that the Spirit is intended by the
apostles. The Godhead of the same Spirit is proved from the fact that He
has a temple wherein He dwells not as a priest, but as God: and is
worshipped with the Father and the Son; whence is understood the oneness
of nature in Them.](2100164)  
[Chapter XIII. To those who object that Catholics, when they ascribe
Godhead to the Holy Spirit, introduce three Gods, it is answered, that
by the same argument they themselves bring in two Gods, unless they deny
Godhead to the Son; after which the orthodox doctrine is set
forth.](2100165)  
[Chapter XIV. Besides the evidence adduced above, other passages can be
brought to prove the sovereignty of the Three Persons. Two are quoted
from the Epistles to the Thessalonians, and by collating other
testimonies of the Scriptures it is shown that in them dominion is
claimed for the Spirit as for the other Persons. Then, by quotation of
another still more express passage in the second Epistle to the
Corinthians, it is inferred both that the Spirit is Lord, and that where
the Lord is, there is the Spirit.](2100166)  
[Chapter XV. Though the Spirit be called Lord, three Lords are not
thereby implied; inasmuch as two Lords are not implied by the fact that
the Son in the same manner as the Father is called Lord in many passages
of Scripture; for Lordship exists in the Godhead, and the Godhead in
Lordship, and these coincide without division in the Three
Persons.](2100167)  
[Chapter XVI. The Father is holy, and likewise the Son and the Spirit,
and so They are honoured in the same Trisagion: nor can we speak more
worthily of God than by calling Him Holy; whence it is clear that we
must not derogate from the dignity of the Holy Spirit. In Him is all
which pertains to God, since in baptism He is named with the Father and
the Son, and the Father has given to Him to be greater than all, nor can
any one deprive Him of this. And so from the very passage of St. John
which heretics used against His dignity, the equality of the Trinity and
the Unity of the Godhead is established. Lastly, after explaining how
the Son receives from the Father, St. Ambrose shows how various heresies
are refuted by the passage cited.](2100168)  
[Chapter XVII. St. Ambrose shows by instances that the places in which
those words were spoken help to the understanding of the words of the
Lord; he shows that Christ uttered the passage quoted from St. John in
Solomon's porch, by which is signified the mind of a wise man, for he
says that Christ would not have uttered this saying in the heart of a
foolish or contentious man. He goes on to say that Christ is stoned by
those who believe not these words, and as the keys of heaven were given
to Peter for his confession of them, so Iscariot, because he believed
not the same, perished evilly. He takes this opportunity to inveigh
against the Jews who bought the Son of God and sold Joseph. He explains
the price paid for each mystically; and having in the same manner
expounded the murmuring of the traitor concerning Magdalene's ointment,
he adds that Christ is bought in one way by heretics in another way by
Catholics, and that those in vain take to themselves the name of
Christians who sever the Spirit from the Fath](2100169)  
[Chapter XVIII. As he purposes to establish the Godhead of the Holy
Spirit by the points already discussed, St. Ambrose touches again on
some of them; for instance, that He does not commit but forgives sin;
that He is not a creature but the Creator; and lastly, that He does not
offer but receives worship.](2100170)  
[Chapter XIX. Having proved above that the Spirit abides and speaks in
the prophets, St. Ambrose infers that He knows all things which are of
God, and therefore is One with the Father and the Son. This same point
he establishes again from the fact that He possesses all that God
possesses, namely, Godhead, knowledge of the heart, truth, a Name above
every name, and power to raise the dead, as is proved from Ezekiel, and
in this He is equal to the Son.](2100171)  
[Chapter XX. The river flowing from the Throne of God is a figure of the
Holy Spirit, but by the waters spoken of by David the powers of heaven
are intended. The kingdom of God is the work of the Spirit; and it is no
matter for wonder if He reigns in this together with the Son, since St.
Paul promises that we too shall reign with the Son.](2100172)  
[Chapter XXI. Isaiah was sent by the Spirit, and accordingly the same
Spirit was seen by him. What is meant by the revolving wheels, and the
divers wings, and how since the Spirit is proclaimed Lord of Sabaoth by
the Seraphim, certainly none but impious men can deny Him this
title.](2100173)  
[Chapter XXII. In proof of the Unity in Trinity the passage of Isaiah
which has been cited is considered, and it is shown that there is no
difference as to its sense amongst those who expound it of the Father,
or of the Son, or of the Spirit. If He Who was crucified was Lord of
glory, so, too, is the Holy Spirit equal in all things to the Father and
the Son, and the Arians will never be able to diminish His
glory.](2100174)

[Prefatory Note.](2100181)  
[Book I.](2100182)  
[Prologue.](2100183)  
[Chapter I. The author distinguishes the faith from the errors of
Pagans, Jews, and Heretics, and after explaining the significance of the
names “God” and “Lord,” shows clearly the difference of Persons in Unity
of Essence. In dividing the Essence, the Arians not only bring in the
doctrine of three Gods, but even overthrow the dominion of the
Trinity.](2100184)  
[Chapter II. The Emperor is exhorted to display zeal in the Faith.
Christ's perfect Godhead is shown from the unity of will and working
which He has with the Father. The attributes of Divinity are shown to be
proper to Christ, Whose various titles prove His essential unity, with
distinction of Person. In no other way can the unity of God be
maintained.](2100185)  
[Chapter III. By evidence gathered from Scripture the unity of Father
and Son is proved, and firstly, a passage, taken from the Book of
Isaiah, is compared with others and expounded in such sort as to show
that in the Son there is no diversity from the Father's nature, save
only as regards the flesh; whence it follows that the Godhead of both
Persons is One. This conclusion is confirmed by the authority of
Baruch.](2100186)  
[Chapter IV. The Unity of God is necessarily implied in the order of
Nature, in the Faith, and in Baptism. The gifts of the Magi declare (1)
the Unity of the Godhead; (2) Christ's Godhead and Manhood. The truth of
the doctrine of the Trinity in Unity is shown in the Angel walking in
the midst of the furnace with Shadrach, Meshach, and
Abednego.](2100187)  
[Chapter V. The various blasphemies uttered by the Arians against Christ
are cited. Before these are replied to, the orthodox are admonished to
beware of the captious arguments of philosophers, forasmuch as in these
especially did the heretics put their trust.](2100188)  
[Chapter VI. By way of leading up to his proof that Christ is not
different from the Father, St. Ambrose cites the more famous leaders of
the Arian party, and explains how little their witness agrees, and shows
what defence the Scriptures provide against them.](2100189)  
[Chapter VII. The likeness of Christ to the Father is asserted on the
authority of St. Paul, the prophets, and the Gospel, and especially in
reliance upon the creation of man in God's image.](2100190)  
[Chapter VIII. The likeness of the Son to the Father being proved, it is
not hard to prove the Son's eternity, though, indeed, this may be
established on the authority of the Prophet Isaiah and St. John the
Evangelist, by which authority the heretical leaders are shown to be
refuted.](2100191)  
[Chapter IX. St. Ambrose questions the heretics and exhibits their
answer, which is, that the Son existed, indeed, before all time, yet was
not co-eternal with the Father, whereat the Saint shows that they
represent the Godhead as changeable, and further, that each Person must
be believed to be eternal.](2100192)  
[Chapter X. Christ's eternity being proved from the Apostle's teaching,
St. Ambrose admonishes us that the Divine Generation is not to be
thought of after the fashion of human procreation, nor to be too
curiously pried into. With the difficulties thence arising he refuses to
deal, saying that whatsoever terms, taken from our knowledge of body,
are used in speaking of this Divine Generation, must be understood with
a spiritual meaning.](2100193)  
[Chapter XI. It cannot be proved from Scripture that the Father existed
before the Son, nor yet can arguments taken from human reproduction
avail to this end, since they bring in absurdities without end. To dare
to affirm that Christ began to exist in the course of time is the height
of blasphemy.](2100194)  
[Chapter XII. Further objections to the Godhead of the Son are met by
the same answer--to wit, that they may equally be urged against the
Father also. The Father, then, being in no way confined by time, place,
or anything else created, no such limitation is to be imposed upon the
Son, Whose marvellous generation is not only of the Father, but of the
Virgin also, and therefore, since in His generation of the Father no
distinction of sex, or the like, was involved, neither was it in His
generation of the Virgin.](2100195)  
[Chapter XIII. Discussion of the Divine Generation is continued. St.
Ambrose illustrates its method by the same example as that employed by
the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews. The duty of believing what is
revealed is shown by the example of Nebuchadnezzar and St. Peter. By the
vision granted to St. Peter was shown the Son's Eternity and
Godhead--the Apostle, then, must be believed in preference to the
teachers of philosophy, whose authority was everywhere falling into
discredit. The Arians, on the other hand, are shown to be like unto the
heathen.](2100196)  
[Chapter XIV. That the Son of God is not a created being is proved by
the following arguments: (1) That He commanded not that the Gospel
should be preached to Himself; (2) that a created being is given over
unto vanity; (3) that the Son has created all things; (4) that we read
of Him as begotten; and (5) that the difference of generation and
adoption has always been understood in those places where both
natures--the divine and the human--are declared to co-exist in Him. All
of which testimony is confirmed by the Apostle's
interpretation.](2100197)  
[Chapter XV. An explanation of Acts ii. 36 and Proverbs viii. 22, which
are shown to refer properly to Christ's manhood alone.](2100198)  
[Chapter XVI. The Arians blaspheme Christ, if by the words “created” and
“begotten” they mean and understand one and the same thing. If, however,
they regard the words as distinct in meaning, they must not speak of
Him, of Whom they have read that He was begotten, as if He were a
created being. This rule is upheld by the witness of St. Paul, who,
professing himself a servant of Christ, forbade worship of a created
being. God being a substance pure and uncompounded, there is no created
nature in Him; furthermore, the Son is not to be degraded to the level
of things created, seeing that in Him the Father is well
pleased.](2100199)  
[Chapter XVII. That Christ is very God is proved from the fact that He
is God's own Son, also from His having been begotten and having come
forth from God, and further, from the unity of will and operation
subsisting in Father and Son. The witness of the apostles and of the
centurion--which St. Ambrose sets over against the Arian teaching--is
adduced, together with that of Isaiah and St. John.](2100200)  
[Chapter XVIII. The errors of the Arians are mentioned in the Nicene
Definition of the Faith, to prevent their deceiving anybody. These
errors are recited, together with the anathema pronounced against them,
which is said to have been not only pronounced at Nicæa, but also twice
renewed at Ariminum.](2100201)  
[Chapter XIX. Arius is charged with the first of the above-mentioned
errors, and refuted by the testimony of St. John. The miserable death of
the Heresiarch is described, and the rest of his blasphemous errors are
one by one examined and disproved.](2100202)  
[Chapter XX. St. Ambrose declares his desire that some angel would fly
to him to purify him, as once the Seraph did to Isaiah--nay more, that
Christ Himself would come to him, to the Emperor, and to his readers,
and finally prays that Gratian and the rest of the faithful may be
exalted by the power and spell of the Lord's Cup, which he describes in
mystic language.](2100203)

but one, that is, God,” refuted by explanation of these words of

[Chapter II. The goodness of the Son of God is proved from His works,
namely, His benefits that He showed towards the people of Israel under
the Old Covenant, and to Christians under the New. It is to one's own
interest to believe in the goodness of Him Who is one's Lord and Judge.
The Father's testimony to the Son. No small number of the Jewish people
bear witness to the Son; the Arians therefore are plainly worse than the
Jews. The words of the Bride, declaring the same goodness of

true.](2100208)

authority of the Old and the New Testament.](2100209)  
[Chapter V. Certain passages from Scripture, urged against the
Omnipotence of Christ, are resolved; the writer is also at especial
pains to show that Christ not seldom spoke in accordance with the
affections of human nature.](2100210)  
[Chapter VI. The passages of Scripture above cited are taken as an
occasion for a digression, wherein our Lord's freedom of action is
proved from the ascription to the Spirit of such freedom, and from
places where it is attributed to the Son.](2100211)  
[Chapter VII. The resolution of the difficulty set forth for
consideration is again taken in hand. Christ truly and really took upon
Him a human will and affections, the source of whatsoever was not in
agreement with His Godhead, and which must be therefore referred to the
fact that He was at the same time both God and man.](2100212)  
[Chapter VIII. Christ's saying, “The Father is greater than I,” is
explained in accordance with the principle just established. Other like
sayings are expounded in like fashion. Our Lord cannot, as touching His
Godhead, be called inferior to the Father.](2100213)  
[Chapter IX. The objection that the Son, being sent by the Father, is,
in that regard at least, inferior, is met by the answer that He was also
sent by the Spirit, Who is yet not considered greater than the Son.
Furthermore, the Spirit, in His turn, is sent by the Father to the Son,
in order that Their unity in action might be shown forth. It is our
duty, therefore, carefully to distinguish what utterances are to be
fitly ascribed to Christ as God, and what to be ascribed to Him as
man.](2100214)  
[Chapter X. The objection taken on the ground of the Son's obedience is
disproved, and the unity of power, Godhead, and operation in the Trinity
set forth, Christ's obedience to His mother, to whom He certainly cannot
be called inferior, is noticed.](2100215)  
[Chapter XI. The purpose and healing effects of the Incarnation. The
profitableness of faith, whereby we know that Christ bore all
infirmities for our sakes,--Christ, Whose Godhead revealed Itself in His
Passion; whence we understand that the mission of the Son of God
entailed no subservience, which belief we need not fear lest it
displease the Father, Who declares Himself to be well pleased in His
Son.](2100216)  
[Chapter XII. Do the Catholics or the Arians take the better course to
assure themselves of the favour of Christ as their Judge? An objection
grounded on Ps. cx. 1 is disposed of, it being shown that when the Son
is invited by the Father to sit at His right hand, no subjection is
intended to be signified--nor yet any preferment, in that the Son sits
at the Father's right hand. The truth of the Trinity of Persons in God,
and of the Unity of their Nature, is shown to be proved by the angelic
Trisagion.](2100217)  
[Chapter XIII. The wicked and dishonourable opinions held by Arians,
Sabellians, and Manichæans as concerning their Judge are shortly
refuted. Christ's remonstrances regarding the rest of His adversaries
being set forth, St. Ambrose expresses a hope of milder judgment for
himself.](2100218)  
[Chapter XIV. The sentence of the Judge is set forth, the counterpleas
of the opposers are considered, and the finality of the sentence, from
which there is no appeal, proved.](2100219)  
[Chapter XV. St. Ambrose deprecates any praise of his own merits: in any
case, the Faith is sufficiently defended by the authoritative support of
holy Scripture, to whose voice the Arians, stubborn as the Jews, are
deaf. He prays that they may be moved to love the truth; meanwhile, they
are to be avoided, as heretics and enemies of Christ.](2100220)  
[Chapter XVI. St. Ambrose assures Gratian of victory, declaring that it
has been foretold in the prophecies of Ezekiel. This hope is further
stayed upon the emperor's piety, the former disasters being the
punishment of Eastern heresy. The book closes with a prayer to God, that
He will now show His mercy, and save the army, the land, and the
sovereign of the faithful.](2100221)  
[Book III.](2100222)  
[Chapter I. Statement of the reasons wherefore the matters, treated of
shortly in the two former, are dealt with more at length in the three
later books. Defence of the employment of fables, which is supported by
the example of Holy Writ, wherein are found various figures of poetic
fable, in particular the Sirens, which are figures of sensual pleasures,
and which Christians ought to be taught to avoid, by the words of Paul
and the deeds of Christ.](2100223)  
[Chapter II. The incidents properly affecting the body which Christ for
our sake took upon Him are not to be accounted to His Godhead, in
respect whereof He is the Most Highest. To deny which is to say that the
Father was incarnate. When we read that God is one, and that there is
none other beside Him, or that He alone has immortality, this must be
understood as true of Christ also, not only to avoid the sinful heresy
above-mentioned (Patripassianism), but also because the activity of the
Father and the Son is declared to be one and the same.](2100224)  
[Chapter III. That the Father and the Son must not be divided is proved
by the words of the Apostle, seeing that it is befitting to the Son that
He should be blessed, only Potentate, and immortal, by nature, that is,
and not by grace, as even the angels themselves are immortal, and that
He should dwell in the unapproachable light. How it is that the Father
and the Son are alike and equally said to be “alone.”](2100225)  
[Chapter IV. We are told that Christ was only “made” so far as regards
the flesh. For the redemption of mankind He needed no means of aid, even
as He needed none in order to His Resurrection, whereas others, in order
to raise the dead, had need of recourse to prayer. Even when Christ
prayed, the prayer was offered by Him in His capacity as human; whilst
He must be accounted divine from the fact that He commanded (that such
and such things should be done). On this point the devil's testimony is
truer than the Arians' arguments. The discussion concludes with an
explanation of the reason why the title of “mighty” is given to the Son
of Man.](2100226)  
[Chapter V. Passages brought forward from Scripture to show that “made”
does not always mean the same as “created;” whence it is concluded that
the letter of Holy Writ should not be made the ground of captious
arguments, after the manner of the Jews, who, however, are shown to be
not so bad as the heretics, and thus the principle already set forth is
confirmed anew.](2100227)  
[Chapter VI. In order to dispose of an objection grounded on a text in
St. John, St. Ambrose first shows that the Arian interpretation lends
countenance to the Manichæans; then, after setting forth the different
ways of dividing the words in this same passage, he shows plainly that
it cannot, without dishonour to the Father, be understood with such
reference to the Godhead as the Arians give it, and expounds the true
meaning thereon.](2100228)  
[Chapter VII. Solomon's words, “The Lord created Me,” etc., mean that
Christ's Incarnation was done for the redemption of the Father's
creation, as is shown by the Son's own words. That He is the “beginning”
may be understood from the visible proofs of His virtuousness, and it is
shown how the Lord opened the ways of all virtues, and was their true
beginning.](2100229)  
[Chapter VIII. The prophecy of Christ's Godhead and Manhood, contained
in the verse of Isaiah just now cited, is unfolded, and its force in
refuting various heresies demonstrated.](2100230)  
[Chapter IX. The preceding quotation from Solomon's Proverbs receives
further explanation.](2100231)  
[Chapter X. Observations on the words of John the Baptist (John i. 30),
which may be referred to divine fore-ordinance, but at any rate, as
explained by the foregoing considerations, must be understood of the
Incarnation. The precedence of Christ is mystically expounded, with
reference to the history of Ruth.](2100232)  
[Chapter XI. St. Ambrose returns to the main question, and shows that
whenever Christ is said to have “been made” (or “become”), this must be
understood with reference to His Incarnation, or to certain limitations.
In this sense several passages of Scripture--especially of St. Paul--are
expounded. The eternal Priesthood of Christ, prefigured in Melchizedek.
Christ possesses not only likeness, but oneness with the
Father.](2100233)  
[Chapter XII. The kingdom of the Father and of the Son is one and
undivided, so likewise is the Godhead of each.](2100234)  
[Chapter XIII. The majesty of the Son is His own, and equal to that of
the Father, and the angels are not partakers, but beholders
thereof.](2100235)  
[Chapter XIV. The Son is of one substance with the Father.](2100236)  
[Chapter XV. The Arians, inasmuch as they assert the Son to be “of
another substance,” plainly acknowledge substance in God. The only
reason why they avoid the use of this term is that they will not, as
Eusebius of Nicomedia has made it evident, confess Christ to be the true
Son of God.](2100237)  
[Chapter XVI. In order to forearm the orthodox against the stratagems of
the Arians, St. Ambrose discloses some of the deceitful confessions used
by the latter, and shows by various arguments, that though they
sometimes call the Son “God,” it is not enough, unless they also admit
His equality with the Father.](2100238)  
[Chapter XVII. An objection based on St. Stephen's vision of the Lord
standing is disposed of, and from the prayers of the same saint,
addressed to the Son of God, the equality of the Son with the Father is
shown.](2100239)  
[Book IV.](2100240)  
[Chapter I. The marvel is, not that men have failed to know Christ, but
that they have not listened to the words of the Scriptures. Christ,
indeed, was not known, even of angels, save by revelation, nor again, by
His forerunner. Follows a description of Christ's triumphal ascent into
heaven, and the excellence of its glory over the assumption of certain
prophets. Lastly, from exposition of the conversation with angels upon
this occasion, the omnipotence of the Son is proved, as against the
Arians.](2100241)  
[Chapter II. None can ascend to heaven without faith; in any case, he
who hath so ascended thither will be cast out wherefore, faith must be
zealously preserved. We ourselves each have a heaven within, the gates
whereof must be opened and be raised by confession of the Godhead of
Christ, which gates are not raised by Arians, nor by those who seek the
Son amongst earthly things, and who must therefore, like the Magdalene,
be sent back to the apostles, against whom the gates of hell shall not
prevail. Scriptures are cited to show that the servant of the Lord must
not diminish aught of his Master's honour.](2100242)  
[Chapter III. The words, “The head of every man is Christ…and the head
of Christ is God” misused by the Arians, are now turned back against
them, to their confutation. Next, another passage of Scripture, commonly
taken by the same heretics as a ground of objection, is called in to
show that God is the Head of Christ, in so far as Christ is human, in
regard of His Manhood, and the unwisdom of their opposition upon the
text, “He who planteth and He who watereth are one,” is displayed. After
which explanations, the meaning of the doctrine that the Father is in
the Son, and the Son in the Father, and that the faithful are in Both,
is expounded.](2100243)  
[Chapter IV. The passage quoted adversely by heretics, namely, “The Son
can do nothing of Himself,” is first explained from the words which
follow; then, the text being examined, word by word, their acceptation
in the Arian sense is shown to be impossible without incurring the
charge of impiety or absurdity, the proof resting chiefly on the
creation of the world and certain miracles of Christ.](2100244)  
[Chapter V. Continuing the exposition of the disputed passage, which he
had begun, Ambrose brings forward four reasons why we affirm that
something cannot be, and shows that the first three fail to apply to
Christ, and infers that the only reason why the Son can do nothing of
Himself is His Unity in Power with the Father.](2100245)  
[Chapter VI. The fourth kind of impossibility (§49) is now taken into
consideration, and it is shown that the Son does nothing that the Father
approves not, there being between Them perfect unity of will and
power.](2100246)  
[Chapter VII. The doctrine had in view for enforcement is corroborated
by the truth that the Son is the Word of the Father--the Word, not in
the sense in which we understand the term, but a living and active Word.
This being so, we cannot deny Him to be of the same Will, Power, and
Substance with the Father.](2100247)  
[Chapter VIII. The heretical objection, that the Son cannot be equal to
the Father, because He cannot beget a Son, is turned back upon the
authors of it. From the case of human nature it is shown that whether a
person begets offspring or not, has nothing to do with his power. Most
of all must this be true since, otherwise, the Father Himself would have
to be pronounced wanting in power. Whence it follows that we have no
right to judge of divine things by human, and must take our stand upon
the authority of Holy Writ, otherwise we must deny all power either to
the Father or to the Son.](2100248)  
[Chapter IX. Various quibbling arguments, advanced by the Arians to show
that the Son had a beginning of existence, are considered and refuted,
on the ground that whilst the Arians plainly prove nothing, or if they
prove anything, prove it against themselves, (inasmuch as He Who is the
beginning of all cannot Himself have a beginning), their reasonings do
not even hold true with regard to facts of human existence. Time could
not be before He was, Who is the Author of time--if indeed at some time
He was not in existence, then the Father was without His Power and
Wisdom. Again, our own human experience shows that a person is said to
exist before he is born.](2100249)  
[Chapter X. The objection that Christ, on the showing of St. John, lives
because of the Father, and therefore is not to be regarded as equal with
the Father, is met by the reply that for the Life of the Son, in respect
of His Godhead, there has never been a time when it began; and that it
is dependent upon none, whilst the passage in question must be
understood as referring to His human life, as is shown by His speaking
there of His body and blood. Two expositions of the passage are given,
the one of which is shown to refer to Christ's Manhood, whilst the
second teaches His equality with the Father, as also His likeness with
men. Rebuke is administered to the Arians for the insult which they are
seeking to inflict upon the Son, and the sense in which the Son can be
said to live “because of” the Father is explained, as also the union of
life with the divine Life. A further objection, based upon the Son's
prayer that He may be glorified by the Father, is briefly
refuted.](2100250)  
[Chapter XI. The particular distinction which the Arians endeavoured to
prove upon the Apostle's teaching that all things are “of” the Father
and “through” the Son, is overthrown, it being shown that in the passage
cited the same Omnipotence is ascribed both to Father and to Son, as is
proved from various texts, especially from the words of St. Paul
himself, in which heretics foolishly find a reference to the Father
only, though indeed there is no diminution or inferiority of the Son's
sovereignty proved, even by such a reference. Finally, the three
phrases, “of Whom,” “through Whom,” “in Whom,” are shown to suppose or
imply no difference (of power), and each and all to hold true of the
Three Persons.](2100251)  
[Chapter XII. The comparison, found in the Gospel of St. John, of the
Son to a Vine and the Father to a husbandman, must be understood with
reference to the Incarnation. To understand it with reference to the
Divine Generation is to doubly insult the Son, making Him inferior to
St. Paul, and bringing Him down to the level of the rest of mankind, as
well as in like manner the Father also, by making Him not merely to be
on one footing with the same Apostle, but even of no account at all. The
Son, indeed, in so far as being God, is also the husbandman, and, as
regards His Manhood, a grape-cluster. True statement of the Father's
pre-eminence.](2100252)  
[Book V.](2100253)  
[Prologue.](2100254)  
[Chapter I. How impious the Arians are, in attacking that on which human
happiness depends. John ever unites the Son with the Father, especially
where he says: “That they may know Thee, the only true God, etc.” In
that place, then, we must understand the words “true God” also of the
Son; for it cannot be denied that He is God, and it cannot be said He is
a false god, and least of all that He is God by appellation only. This
last point being proved from the Apostle's words, we rightly confess
that Christ is true God.](2100255)  
[Chapter II. Since it has been proved that the Son is true God, and in
that is not inferior to the Father, it is shown that by the word solus
(alone) when used of the Father in the Scriptures, the Son is not
excluded; nay, that this expression befits Him above all, and Him alone.
The Trinity is alone, not amongst all, but above all. The Son alone does
what the Father does, and alone has immortality. But we must not for
this reason separate Him from the Father in our controversies. We may,
however, understand that passage of the Incarnation. Lastly the Father
is shut out from a share in the redemption of men by those who would
have the Son to be separated from Him.](2100256)  
[Chapter III. To the objection of the Arians, that two Gods are
introduced by a unity of substance, the answer is that a plurality of
Gods is more likely to be inferred from diversity of substance. Further,
their charge recoils upon themselves. Manifold diversity is the reason
why two men cannot be said to be one man, though all men are called
individually man, where a unity of nature is referred to. There is one
nature alone in them, but there is wholly a unity in the Divine Persons.
Therefore the Son is not to be severed from the Father, especially as
they dare not deny that worship is due to Him.](2100257)  
[Chapter IV. It is objected by heretics that Christ offered worship to
His Father. But instead it is shown that this must be referred to His
humanity, as is clear from an examination of the passage. However, it
also offers fresh witness to His Godhead, as we often see it happening
in other actions that Christ did.](2100258)  
[Chapter V. Ambrose answers those who press the words of the Lord to the
mother of Zebedee's children, by saying that they were spoken out of
kindness, because Christ was unwilling to cause her grief. Ample reason
for such tenderness is brought forward. The Lord would rather leave the
granting of that request to the Father, than declare it to be
impossible. This answer of Christ's, however, is not to His detriment,
as is shown both by His very words, and also by comparing them with
other passages.](2100259)  
[Chapter VI. Wishing to answer the above-stated objection somewhat more
fully, he maintains that this request, had it not been impossible in
itself, would have been possible for Christ to grant; especially as the
Father has given all judgment to Him; which gift we must understand to
have been given without any feature of imperfection. However, he proves
that the request must be reckoned amongst the impossibilities. To make
it really possible, he teaches that Christ's answer must be taken in
accordance with His human nature, and shows this next by an exposition
of the passage. Lastly, he once more confirms the reply he has given on
the impossibility of Christ's session.](2100260)  
[Chapter VII. Objection is taken to the following passage: “Thou hast
loved them, as Thou hast loved Me.” To remove it, he shows first the
impiety of the Arian explanation; then compares these words with others;
and lastly, takes the whole passage into consideration. Hence he gathers
that the mission of Christ, although it is to be received according to
the flesh, is not to His detriment. When this is proved he shows how the
divine mission takes place.](2100261)  
[Chapter VIII. Christ, so far as He is true Son of God, has no Lord, but
only so far as He is Man; as is shown by His words in which He addressed
at one time the Father, at another the Lord. How many heresies are
silenced by one verse of Scripture! We must distinguish between the
things that belong to Christ as Son of God or as Son of David. For under
the latter title only must we ascribe it to Him that He was a servant.
Lastly, he points out that many passages cannot be taken except as
referring to the Incarnation.](2100262)  
[Chapter IX. The saint meets those who in Jewish wise object to the
order of the words: “In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the
Holy Ghost,” with the retort that the Son also is often placed before
the Father; though he first points out that an answer to this objection
has been already given by him.](2100263)  
[Chapter X. The Arians openly take sides with the heathen in attacking
the words: “He that believeth on Me, believeth not on Me,” etc. The true
meaning of the passage is unfolded; and to prevent us from believing
that the Lord forbade us to have faith in Him, it is shown how He spoke
at one time as God, at another as Man. After bringing forward examples
of various results of that faith, he shows that certain other passages
also must be taken in the same way.](2100264)  
[Chapter XI. We must refer the fact that Christ is said to speak nothing
of Himself, to His human nature. After explaining how it is right to say
that He hears and sees the Father as being God, He shows conclusively,
by a large number of proofs, that the Son of God is not a
creature.](2100265)  
[Chapter XII. He confirms what has been already said, by the parable of
the rich man who went into a far country to receive for himself a
kingdom; and shows that when the Son delivers up the kingdom to the
Father, we must not regard the fact that the Father is said to put all
things in subjection under Him, in a disparaging way. Here we are the
kingdom of Christ, and in Christ's kingdom. Hereafter we shall be in the
kingdom of God, where the Trinity will reign together.](2100266)  
[Chapter XIII. With the desire to learn what subjection to Christ means
after putting forward and rejecting various ideas of subjection, he runs
through the Apostle's words; and so puts an end to the blasphemous
opinions of the heretics on this matter. The subjection, which is shown
to be future, cannot concern the Godhead, since there has always been
the greatest harmony of wills between the Father and the Son. Also to
that same Son in His Godhead all things have indeed been made subject;
but they are said to be not yet subject to Him in this sense, because
all men do not obey His commands. But after that they have been made
subject, then shall Christ also be made subject in them, and the
Father's work be perfected.](2100267)  
[Chapter XIV. He continues the discussion of the difficulty he has
entered upon, and teaches that Christ is not subject but only according
to the flesh. Christ, however, whilst in subjection in the Flesh, still
gave proofs of His Godhead. He combats the idea that Christ is made
subject in This. The humanity indeed, which He adopted, has been so far
made subject in us, as ours has been raised in that very humanity of
His. Lastly, we are taught, when that same subjection of Christ will
take place.](2100268)  
[Chapter XV. He briefly takes up again the same points of dispute, and
shrewdly concludes from the unity of the divine power in the Father and
the Son, that whatever is said of the subjection of the Son is to be
referred to His humanity alone. He further confirms this on proof of the
love, which exists alike in either.](2100269)  
[Chapter XVI. The Arians are condemned by the Holy Spirit through the
mouth of David: for they dare to limit Christ's knowledge. The passage
cited by them in proof of this is by no means free from suspicion of
having been corrupted. But to set this right, we must mark the word
“Son.” For knowledge cannot fail Christ as Son of God, since He is
Wisdom; nor the recognition of any part, for He created all things. It
is not possible that He, who made the ages, cannot know the future, much
less the day of judgment. Such knowledge, whether it concerns anything
great or small, may not be denied to the Son, nor yet to the Holy
Spirit. Lastly, various proofs are given from which we can gather that
this knowledge exists in Christ.](2100270)  
[Chapter XVII. Christ acted for our advantage in being unwilling to
reveal the day of judgment. This is made plain by other words of our
Lord and by a not dissimilar passage from Paul's writings. Other
passages in which the same ignorance seems to be attributed to the
Father are brought forward to meet those who are anxious to know why
Christ answered His disciples, as though He did not know. From these
Ambrose argues against them that if they admit ignorance and inability
in the Father, they must admit that the same Substance exists in the Son
as in the Father; unless they prefer to accuse the Son of falsehood;
since it belongs neither to Him nor to the Father to deceive, but the
unity of both is pointed out in the passage named.](2100271)  
[Chapter XVIII. Wishing to give a reason for the Lord's answer to the
apostles, he assigns the one received to Christ's tenderness. Then when
another reason is supplied by others he confesses that it is true; for
the Lord spoke it by reason of His human feelings. Hence he gathers that
the knowledge of the Father and the Son is equal, and that the Son is
not inferior to the Father. After having set beside the text, in which
He is said to be inferior, another whereby He is declared to be equal,
he censures the rashness of the Arians in judging about the Son, and
shows that whilst they wickedly make Him to be inferior, He is rightly
called a Stone by Himself.](2100272)  
[Chapter XIX. The Saint having turned to God the Father, explains why he
does not deride that the Son is inferior to the Father, then he declares
it is not for him to measure the Son of God, since it was given to an
angel--nay, perhaps even to Christ as man--to measure merely Jerusalem.
Arius, he says, has shown himself to be an imitator of Satan. It is a
rash thing to hold discussions on the divine Generation. Since so great
a sign of human generation has been given by Isaiah, we ought not to
make comparisons in divine things. Lastly he shows how carefully we
ought to avoid the pride of Arius, by putting before us various examples
of Scriptures.](2100273)  
[On the Mysteries.](2100274)  
[Introduction.](2100275)  
[Chapter I. St. Ambrose states that after the explanations he has
already given of holy living, he will now explain the Mysteries. Then
after giving his reasons for not having done so before, he explains the
mystery of the opening of the ears, and shows how this was of old done
by Christ Himself.](2100276)  
[Chapter II. What those who were to be initiated promised on entering
the Church, of the witnesses to these promises, and wherefore they then
turned themselves to the East.](2100277)  
[Chapter III. St. Ambrose points out that we must consider the divine
presence and working in the water and the sacred ministers, and then
brings forward many Old Testament figures of baptism.](2100278)  
[Chapter IV. That water does not cleanse without the Spirit is shown by
the witness of John and by the very form of the administration of the
sacrament. And this is also declared to be signified by the pool in the
Gospel and the man who was there healed. In the same passage, too, is
shown that the Holy Spirit truly descended on Christ at His baptism, and
the meaning of this mystery is explained.](2100279)  
[Chapter V. Christ is Himself present in Baptism, so that we need not
consider the person of His ministers. A brief explanation of the
confession of the Trinity as usually uttered by those about to be
baptized.](2100280)  
[Chapter VI. Why they who come forth from the laver of baptism are
anointed on the head; why, too, after baptism, their feet are washed,
and what sins are remitted in each case.](2100281)  
[Chapter VII. The washing away of sins is indicated by the white robes
of the catechumens, whence the Church speaks of herself as black and
comely. Angels marvel at her brightness as at that of the flesh of the
Lord. Moreover, Christ Himself commended His beauty to His Spouse under
many figures. The mutual affection of the one for the other is
described.](2100282)  
[Chapter VIII. Of the mystical feast of the altar of the Lord. Lest any
should think lightly of it, St. Ambrose shows that it is of higher
antiquity than the sacred rites of the Jews, since it was foreshadowed
in the sacrifice of Melchisedech, and far better than the manna, as
being the Body of Christ.](2100283)  
[Chapter IX. In order that no one through observing the outward part
should waver in faith, many instances are brought forward wherein the
outward nature has been changed, and so it is proved that bread is made
the true body of Christ. The treatise then is brought to a termination
with certain remarks as to the effects of the sacrament, the disposition
of the recipients, and such like.](2100284)  
[Concerning Repentance.](2100285)  
[Introduction.](2100286)  
[Book I.](2100287)  
[Chapter I. St. Ambrose writes in praise of gentleness, pointing out how
needful that grace is for the rulers of the Church, and commended to
them by the meekness of Christ. As the Novatians have fallen away from
this, they cannot be considered disciples of Christ. Their pride and
harshness are inveighed against.](2100288)  
[Chapter II. The assertion of the Novatians that they refuse communion
only to the lapsed agrees neither with the teaching of holy Scripture
nor with their own. And whereas they allege as a pretext their reverence
for the divine power, they really are contemning it, inasmuch as it is a
sign of low estimation not to use the whole of a power entrusted to one.
But the Church rightly claims the power of binding and loosing, which
heretics have not, inasmuch as she has received it from the Holy Spirit,
against Whom they act presumptuously.](2100289)  
[Chapter III. To the argument of the Novatians, that they only deny
forgiveness in the case of greater sins, St. Ambrose replies, that this
is also an offence against God, Who gave the power to forgive all sins,
but that of course a more severe penance must follow in case of graver
sins. He points out likewise that this distinction as to the gravity of
sins assigns, as it were, severity to God, Whose mercy in the
Incarnation is overlooked by the Novatians.](2100290)  
[Chapter IV. St. Ambrose proceeds with the proof of the divine mercy,
and shows by the testimony of the Gospels that it prevails over
severity, and he adduces the instance of athletes to show that of those
who have denied Christ before men, all are not to be esteemed
alike.](2100291)  
[Chapter V. The objection from the unchangeableness of God is answered
from several passages of Scripture, wherein God promises forgiveness to
sinners on their repentance. St. Ambrose also shows that mercy will be
more readily accorded to such as have sinned, as it were, against their
will, which he illustrates by the case of prisoners taken in war, and by
language put into the mouth of the devil.](2100292)  
[Chapter VI. The Novatians, by excluding such from the banquet of
Christ, imitate not indeed the good Samaritan, but the proud lawyer, the
priest, and the Levite who are blamed in the Gospel, and are indeed
worse than these.](2100293)  
[Chapter VII. St. Ambrose, addressing Christ, complains of the
Novatians, and shows that they have no part with Christ, Who wishes all
men to be saved.](2100294)  
[Chapter VIII. It was the Lord's will to confer great gifts on His
disciples. Further, the Novatians confute themselves by the practices of
laying on of hands and of baptism, since it is by the same power that
sins are remitted in penance and in baptism. Their conduct is then
contrasted with that of our Lord.](2100295)  
[Chapter IX. By collating similar passages with 1 Sam. iii. 25, St.
Ambrose shows that the meaning is not that no one shall intercede, but
that the intercessor must be worthy as were Moses and Jeremiah, at whose
prayers we read that God spared Israel.](2100296)  
[Chapter X. St. John did not absolutely forbid that prayer should be
made for those who “sin unto death,” since he knew that Moses, Jeremiah,
and Stephen had so prayed, and he himself implies that forgiveness is
not to be denied them.](2100297)  
[Chapter XI. The passage quoted from St. John's Epistle is confirmed by
another in which salvation is promised to those who believe in Christ,
which refutes the Novatians who try to induce the lapsed to believe,
although denying them pardon. Furthermore, many who had lapsed have
received the grace of martyrdom, whilst the example of the good
Samaritan shows that we must not abandon those in whom even the faintest
amount of faith is still alive.](2100298)  
[Chapter XII. Another passage of St. John is considered. The necessity
of keeping the commandments of God may be complied with by those who,
having fallen, repent, as well as by those who have not fallen, as is
shown in the case of David.](2100299)  
[Chapter XIII. They who have committed a “sin unto death” are not to be
abandoned, but subjected to penance, according to St. Paul. Explanation
of the phrase “Deliver unto Satan.” Satan can afflict the body, but
these afflictions bring spiritual profit, showing the power of God, Who
thus turns Satan's devices against himself.](2100300)  
[Chapter XIV. St. Ambrose explains that the flesh given to Satan for
destruction is eaten by the serpent when the soul is set free from
carnal desires. He gives, therefore, various rules for guarding the
senses, points out the snares laid for us by means of pleasures, and
exhorts his hearers not to fear the destruction of the flesh by the
serpent.](2100301)  
[Chapter XV. Returning from this digression, St. Ambrose explains what
is the meaning of St. Paul where he speaks of coming “with a rod or in
the spirit of meekness.”One who has grievously fallen is to be
separated, but to be again restored to religious privileges when he has
sufficiently repented. The old leaven is purged out when the hardness of
the letter is tempered by the meal of a milder interpretation. All
should be sprinkled with the Church's meal and fed with the food of
charity, lest they become like that envious elder brother, whose example
is followed by the Novatians.](2100302)  
[Chapter XVI. Comparison between the apostles and Novatians. The fitness
of the words, “Ye know not what spirit ye are of,” when applied to them.
The desire of penance is extinguished by them when they take away its
fruit. And thus are sinners deprived of the promises of Christ, though,
indeed, they ought not to be too soon admitted to the mysteries. Some
examples of repentance.](2100303)  
[Chapter XVII. That gentleness must be added to severity, as is shown in
the case of St. Paul at Corinth. The man had been baptized, though the
Novatians argue against it. And by the word “destruction” is not meant
annihilation but severe chastening.](2100304)  
[Book II.](2100305)  
[Chapter I. St. Ambrose gives additional rules concerning repentance,
and shows that it must not be delayed.](2100306)  
[Chapter II. A passage quoted by the heretics against repentance is
explained in two ways, the first being that Heb. vi. 4 refers to the
impossibility of being baptized again; the second, that what is
impossible with man is possible with God.](2100307)  
[Chapter III. Explanation of the parable of the Prodigal Son, in which
St. Ambrose applies it to refute the teaching of the Novatians, proving
that reconciliation ought not to be refused to the greatest offender
upon suitable proof of repentance.](2100308)  
[Chapter IV. St. Ambrose turns against the Novatians themselves another
objection concerning blasphemy against the Holy Spirit, showing that it
consists in an erroneous belief, proving this by St. Peter's words
against Simon Magus, and other passages, exhorting the Novatians to
return to the Church, affirming that such is our Lord's mercy that even
Judas would have found forgiveness had he repented.](2100309)  
[Chapter V. As to the words of St. Peter to Simon Magus, from which the
Novatians infer that there was no forgiveness for the latter, it is
pointed out that St. Peter, knowing his evil heart, might well use words
of doubt, and then by some Old Testament instances it is pointed out
that “perchance” does not exclude forgiveness. The apostles transmitted
to us that penitence, the fruits of which are shown in the case of
David. St. Ambrose then adduces the example of the Ephraimites, whose
penitence must be followed in order to gain the divine mercy and the
sacraments.](2100310)  
[Chapter VI. St. Ambrose teaches out of the prophet Isaiah what they
must do who have fallen. Then referring to our Lord's proverbial
expression respecting piping and dancing, he condemns dances. Next by
the example of Jeremiah he sets forth the necessary accompaniments of
repentance. And lastly, in order to show the efficacy of this medicine
of penance, he enumerates the names of many who have used it for
themselves or for others.](2100311)  
[Chapter VII. An exhortation to mourning and confession of sins for
Christ is moved by these and the tears of the Church. Illustration from
the story of Lazarus. After showing that the Novatians are the
successors of those who planned to kill Lazarus, St. Ambrose argues that
the full forgiveness of every sin is signified by the odour of the
ointment poured by Mary on the feet of Christ; and further, that the
Novatian heretics find their likeness in Judas, who grudged and envied
when others rejoiced.](2100312)  
[Chapter VIII. In urging repentance St. Ambrose turns to his own case,
expressing the wish that he could wash our Lord's feet like the woman in
the Gospel, which is a great pattern of penitence, though such as cannot
attain to it find acceptance. He prays for himself, especially that he
may sorrow with sinners, who are better than himself. Those for whom
Christ died are not to be contemned.](2100313)  
[Chapter IX. In what way faith is necessary for repentance. Means for
paying our debts, in which work, prayer, tears, and fasting are of more
value than money. Some instances are adduced, and St. Ambrose declares
that generosity is profitable, but only when joined with faith; it is,
moreover, liable to certain defects. He goes on to speak of some defects
in repentance, such as too great haste in seeking reconciliation,
considering abstinence from sacraments all that is needed, of committing
sin in hope of repenting later.](2100314)  
[Chapter X. In order to do away with the feeling of shame which holds
back the guilty from public penance, St. Ambrose points out the
advantage of prayers offered by the whole Church, and sets forth the
example of saints who have sorrowed. Then, after reproving those who
imagine that penance may be often repeated, he points out the difficulty
of repentance, and how it is to be carried out.](2100315)  
[Chapter XI. The possibility of repentance is a reason why baptism
should not be deferred to old age, a practice which is against the will
of God in holy Scripture. But it is of no use to practise penance whilst
still serving lusts. These must be first subdued.](2100316)  
[Note on the Penitential Discipline of the Early Church.](2100317)  
[Concerning Virgins.](2100318)  
[Introduction.](2100319)  
[Book I.](2100320)  
[Chapter I. St. Ambrose, reflecting upon the account he will have to
give of his talents, determines to write, and consoles himself with
certain examples of God's mercy. Then recognizing his own deficiencies
desires that he may be dealt with like the fig-tree in the Gospel, and
expresses a hope that words will not fail him in his endeavour to preach
Christ.](2100321)  
[Chapter II. This treatise has a favourable beginning, since it is the
birthday of the holy Virgin Agnes, of whose name, modesty, and martyrdom
St. Ambrose speaks in commendation, but more especially of her age,
seeing that she, being but twelve years old, was superior to terrors,
promises, tortures, and death itself, with a courage wholly worthy of a
man.](2100322)  
[Chapter III. Virginity is praised on many grounds, but chiefly because
it brought down the Word from heaven, and hence its pursuit, which
existed in but few under the old covenant, has spread to countless
numbers.](2100323)  
[Chapter IV. The comeliness of virginity never existed amongst the
heathen, neither with the vestal virgins, nor amongst philosophers, such
as Pythagoras.](2100324)  
[Chapter V. Heaven is the home of virginity, and the Son of God its
Author, Who though He was a Virgin before the Virgin, yet being of the
Virgin took the Virgin Church as His bride. Of her we have all been
born. Some of her gifts are enumerated. Her daughters have a special
excellence in that virginity is not a matter of precept, and that it is
a most powerful help in the pursuit of piety.](2100325)  
[Chapter VI. St. Ambrose explains that he is not speaking against
marriage, and proceeds to compare the advantages and disadvantages of
the single and married state.](2100326)  
[Chapter VII. St. Ambrose exhorts parents to train their children to
virginity, and sets before them the troubles arising from their desire
to have grandchildren. He says however that he does not forbid marriage,
but rather defends it against heretics who oppose it. Still setting
virginity before marriage, he speaks of the beauty of their spouse, and
of the gifts wherewith He adorns them, and applies to these points
certain verses of the Song of Songs.](2100327)  
[Chapter VIII. Taking the passage concerning the honeycomb in the Song
of Songs, he expounds it, comparing the sacred virgins to
bees.](2100328)  
[Chapter IX. Other passages from the Song of Songs are considered with
relation to the present subject, and St. Ambrose exhorting the virgin to
seek for Christ, points out where He may be found. A description of His
perfections follows, and a comparison is made between virgins and the
angels.](2100329)  
[Chapter X. Finally, another glory of virginity is mentioned, that it is
free from avarice. St. Ambrose, addressing his sister, reminds her of
the great happiness of those who are free from those troubles as to
luxury and vanity which come upon those who are about to
marry.](2100330)  
[Chapter XI. St. Ambrose answers objections made to the uselessness of
his exhortations in favour of virginity, and brings forward instances of
virgins especially in various places he mentions, and speaks of their
zeal in the cause.](2100331)  
[Chapter XII. It is very desirable that parents should encourage the
desire for the virgin life, but more praiseworthy when the love of God
draws a maiden even against their will. The violence of parents and the
loss of property are not to be feared, and an instance of this is
related by St. Ambrose.](2100332)  
[Book II.](2100333)  
[Chapter I. In this book St. Ambrose purposes to treat of the training
of virgins, using examples rather than precepts, and explains why he
does so in writing rather than by word of mouth.](2100334)  
[Chapter II. The life of Mary is set before virgins as an example, and
her many virtues are dwelt upon, her chastity, humility, hard life, love
of retirement, and the like; then her kindness to others, her zeal in
learning, and love of frequenting the temple. St. Ambrose then sets
forth how she, adorned with all these virtues, will come to meet the
numberless bands of virgins and lead them with great triumph to the
bridal chamber of the Spouse.](2100335)  
[Chapter III. St. Ambrose having set forth the Virgin Mary as a pattern
for life, adduces Thecla as a model for learning how to die. Thecla
suffered not from the beasts to whom she was condemned, but on the
contrary received from them signs of reverence. He then proceeds to
introduce a more recent example.](2100336)  
[Chapter IV. A virgin at Antioch, having refused to sacrifice to idols,
was condemned to a house of ill-fame, whence she escaped unharmed,
having changed clothes with a Christian soldier. Then when he was
condemned for this, she returned and the two contended for the prize of
martyrdom, which was at last given to each.](2100337)  
[Chapter V. The story of the two Pythagorean friends, Damon and Pythias,
is related by St. Ambrose, who points out that the case mentioned in the
last chapter is more praiseworthy. A comparison is instituted between
the treatment of their gods by heathen without any punishment, and
Jeroboam's irreverence with its punishment.](2100338)  
[Chapter VI. St. Ambrose, in concluding the second book, ascribes any
good there may be in it to the merits of the virgins, and sets forth
that it was right before laying down any severe precepts to encourage
them by examples, as is done both in human teaching and in holy
Scripture.](2100339)  
[Book III.](2100340)  
[Chapter I. St. Ambrose now goes back to the address of Liberius when he
gave the veil to Marcellina. Touching on the crowds pressing to the
bridal feast of that Spouse Who feeds them all, he passes on to the
fitness of her profession on the day on which Christ was born of a
Virgin, and concludes with a fervent exhortation to love
Him.](2100341)  
[Chapter II. Touching next upon the training of a virgin, he speaks of
moderation in food and drink, and of restraint upon the impulses of the
mind, introducing some teaching upon the fable of the death and
resurrection of Hippolytus, and advises the avoidance of certain
meats.](2100342)  
[Chapter III. Virgins are exhorted to avoid visits, to observe modesty,
to be silent during the celebration of the Mysteries after the example
of Mary. Then after narrating the story of a heathen youth, and saying
of a poet, St. Ambrose relates a miracle wrought by a holy
priest.](2100343)  
[Chapter IV. Having summed up the address of Liberius, St. Ambrose
passes on to the virtues of his sister, especially her fasts, which
however he advises her to moderate to some extent, and to exercise
herself in other matters, after the example which he adduces. Especially
he recommends the Lord's Prayer, and the repetition of Psalms by night,
and the recitation of the Creed before daylight.](2100344)  
[Chapter V. St. Ambrose, speaking of tears, explains David's saying,
“Every night wash l my couch with my tears,” and goes on to speak of
Christ bearing our griefs and infirmities. Everything should be referred
to His honour, and we ought to rejoice with spiritual joy, but not after
a worldly fashion.](2100345)  
[Chapter VI. Having mentioned the Baptist, St. Ambrose enters into a
description of the events concerning his death, and speaks against
dancing and the festivities of the wicked.](2100346)  
[Chapter VII. In reply to Marcellina, who had asked what should be
thought of those who to escape violence killed themselves, St. Ambrose
replies by narrating the history of Pelagia, a virgin, with her mother
and sister, and goes on to speak of the martyrdom of the blessed
Sotheris, one of their own ancestors.](2100347)  
[Concerning Widows.](2100348)  
[Introduction.](2100349)  
[Chapter I. After having written about virgins, it seemed needful to say
something concerning widows, since the Apostle joins the two classes
together, and the latter are as it were teachers of the former, and far
superior to those who are married. Elijah was sent to a widow, a great
mark of honour; yet widows are not honourable like her of Sarepta,
unless they copy her virtues, notably hospitality. The avarice of men is
rebuked, who forfeit the promises of God by their grasping.](2100350)  
[Chapter II. The precepts of the Apostle concerning a widow indeed are
laid down, such as, that she bring up children, attend to her parents,
desire to please God, show herself irreproachable, set forth a ripeness
of merits, have been the wife of one man. St. Ambrose notes, however,
that a second marriage was not condemned by St. Paul, and adds that
widows must have a good report for virtue with all. The reasons why
younger widows are to be avoided, and what is meant by its being better
to marry than to burn. St. Ambrose then goes on to speak of the dignity
of widows, shown by the fact that any injury done to them is visited by
the anger of God.](2100351)  
[Chapter III. St. Ambrose returns to the story of the widow of Sarepta,
and shows that she represented the Church, hence that she was an example
to virgins, married women, and widows. Then he refers to the prophet as
setting forth Christ, inasmuch as he foretold the mysteries and the rain
which was to come. Next he touches upon and explains the twofold sign of
Gideon, and points out that it is not in every one's power to work
miracles, and that the Incarnation of Christ and the rejection of the
Jews were foreshadowed in that account.](2100352)  
[Chapter IV. By the example of Anna St. Ambrose shows what ought to be
the life of widows, and shows that she was an example of chastity at
every age. From this he argues that there are three degrees of the same
virtue, all of which are included in the Church, and sets forth several
examples in Mary, in Anna, and in Susanna. But, he adds, the state of
virginity is superior to either of the others, but that a widow ought to
take greater care for the preservation of her good name.](2100353)  
[Chapter V. Liberality to the poor is recommended by the example of the
widow the Gospel, whose two mites were preferred to the large gifts of
the rich. The two mites are treated as mystically representing the two
Testaments. What that treasure is for which we are taught to offer,
after the example of the wise men, three gifts, or after that of the
widow, two. St. Ambrose concludes the chapter by an exhortation to
widows to be zealous in good works.](2100354)  
[Chapter VI. Naomi is an instance of a widow receiving back from her
daughter-in-law the fruits of her own good training, and is a token that
necessary support will never fail the good widow. And if her life
appears sad, she is happy, since the promises of the Lord are made to
her. St. Ambrose then touches upon the benefits of weeping.](2100355)  
[Chapter VII. By the example of Judith is shown that courage is not
wanting in widows; her preparation for her visit to Holofernes is dwelt
upon, as also her chastity and her wisdom, her sobriety and moderation.
Lastly, St. Ambrose, after demonstrating that she was no less brave than
prudent, sets forth her modesty after her success.](2100356)  
[Chapter VIII. Though many other widows came near to Judith in virtue,
St. Ambrose proposes to speak of Deborah only. What a pattern of virtue
she must have been for widows, who was chosen to govern and defend men.
It was no small glory to her that when her son was over the host he
refused to go forth to battle unless she would go also. So that she led
the army and foretold the result. In this story the conflicts and
triumphs of the Church, and her spiritual weapons, are set forth, and
every excuse of weakness is taken from women.](2100357)  
[Chapter IX. To an objection that the state of widowhood might indeed be
endurable if circumstances were pleasant, St. Ambrose replies that
pleasant surroundings are more dangerous than even trouble; and goes to
show by examples taken from holy Scripture, that widows may find much
happiness in their children and their sons-in-law. They should have
recourse to the Apostles, who are able to help us, and should entreat
for the intercessions of angels and martyrs. He touches then on certain
complaints respecting loneliness, and care of property, and ends by
pointing out the unseemliness of a widow marrying who has daughters
either married already or of marriageable age.](2100358)  
[Chapter X. St. Ambrose returns again to the subject of Christ, speaking
of His goodness in all misery. The various ways in which the good
Physician treats our diseases, and the quickness of the healing if only
we do not neglect to call upon Him. He touches upon the moral meaning of
the will, which he shows was manifested in Peter's mother-in-law, and
lastly points out what a minister of Christ and specially a bishop ought
to be, and says that they specially must rise through grace.](2100359)  
[Chapter XI. Having shown that the pretexts usually alleged for second
marriages have no weight, St. Ambrose declares that he does not condemn
them, though from the Apostle's words he sets forth their
inconveniences, though the state of those twice married is approved in
the Church, and he takes occasion to advert to those heretics who forbid
them. And he says that it is because the strength of different persons
varies that chastity is not commanded, but only recommended.](2100360)  
[Chapter XII. The difference between matters of precept and of counsel
is treated of, as shown in the case of the young man in the Gospel, and
the difference of the rewards set forth both for counsels and precepts
is spoken of.](2100361)  
[Chapter XIII. St. Ambrose, treating of the words in the Gospel
concerning eunuchs, condemns those who make themselves such. Those only
deserve praise who have through continence gained the victory over
themselves, but no one is to be compelled to live this life, as neither
Christ nor the Apostle laid down such a law, so that the marriage vow is
not to be blamed, though that of chastity is better.](2100362)  
[Chapter XIV. Though a widow may have received no commandment, yet she
has received so many counsels that she ought not to think little of
them. St. Ambrose would be sorry to lay any snare for her, seeing that
the field of the Church grows richer as a result of wedlock, but it is
absolutely impossible to deny that widowhood, which St. Paul praises, is
profitable. Consequently, he speaks severely about those who have
proscribed widowhood by law.](2100363)  
[Chapter XV. St. Ambrose meets the objection of those who make the
desire of having children an excuse for second marriage, and especially
in the case of those who have children of their former marriage; and
points out the consequent troubles of disagreements amongst the
children, and even between the married persons, and gives a warning
against a wrong use of Scripture instances in this matter.](2100364)
