#### <span id="iv.ii.ii.xiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIII.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xiv-p1"></span>St. Ambrose shows from the Scriptures
that the Name of the Three Divine Persons is one, and first the unity of
the Name of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, inasmuch as each is called
Paraclete and Truth.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xiv-p2"></span>132. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.ii.ii.xiv-p2.1"></span>Who</span>, then, would dare to deny the
oneness of Name, when he sees the oneness of the working. But why should
I maintain the unity of the Name by arguments, when there is the plain
testimony of the Divine Voice that the Name of the Father, the Son, and
the Holy Spirit is one? For it is written: “Go, baptize all nations in
the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of <span id="page_111">p.
111</span> <span id="iv.ii.ii.xiv-Page_111"></span>the Holy
Spirit.” <span id="fr_955"></span>[956](#fn_955.md) He said, “in the Name,”
not “in the Names.” So, then, the Name of the Father is not one, that of
the Son another, and that of the Holy Spirit another, for God is one;
the Names are not more than one, for there are not two Gods, or three
Gods.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xiv-p4"></span>132. And that He might reveal that the
Godhead is one and the Majesty one, because the Name of the Father, the
Son, and the Holy Spirit is one, and the Son did not come in one Name
and the Holy Spirit in another, the Lord Himself said: “I am come in My
Father’s Name, and ye did not receive Me, if another shall come in his
own name ye will receive him.” <span id="fr_956"></span>[957](#fn_956.md)

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xiv-p6"></span>133. And Scripture makes clear that
that which is the Father’s Name, the same is also that of the Son, for
the Lord said in Exodus: “I will go before thee in My Name, and will
call by My Name the Lord before thee.” <span
id="fr_957"></span>[958](#fn_957.md) So, then, the Lord said that He would
call the Lord by His Name. The Lord, then, is the Name of the Father and
of the Son.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xiv-p8"></span>134. But since the Name of the Father
and of the Son is one, learn that the same is the Name of the Holy
Spirit also, since the Holy Spirit came in the Name of the Son, as it is
written: “But the Paraclete, even the Holy Spirit, Whom the Father will
send in My Name, He shall teach you all things.” <span
id="fr_958"></span>[959](#fn_958.md) But He Who came in the Name of the Son
came also certainly in the Name of the Father, for the Name of the
Father and of the Son is one. Thus it comes to pass that the Name of the
Father and of the Son is also that of the Holy Spirit. For there is no
other Name given under heaven wherein we must be saved. <span
id="fr_959"></span>[960](#fn_959.md)

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xiv-p11"></span>155. At the same time He showed that
the oneness of the Divine Name must be taught, not the difference, since
Christ came in the oneness of the Name, but Antichrist will come in his
own name, as it is written: “I am come in My Father’s Name, and ye did
not receive Me, if another shall come in his own name, ye will receive
him.” <span id="fr_960"></span>[961](#fn_960.md)

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xiv-p13"></span>156. We are, then, clearly taught by
these passages that there is no difference of Name in the Father, the
Son, and the Holy Spirit; and that that which is the Name of the Father
is also the Name of the Son, and likewise that which is the Name of the
Son is also that of the Holy Spirit, when the Son also is called
Paraclete, as is the Holy Spirit. And therefore does the Lord Jesus say
in the Gospel: “I will ask My Father, and He shall give you another
Paraclete, to be with you for ever, even the Spirit of Truth.” <span
id="fr_961"></span>[962](#fn_961.md) And He said well “another,” that you
might not suppose that the Son is also the Spirit, for oneness is of the
Name, not a Sabellian confusion of the Son and of the Spirit. <span
id="fr_962"></span>[963](#fn_962.md)

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xiv-p16"></span>157. So, then, the Son is one
Paraclete, the Holy Spirit another Paraclete; for John called the Son a
Paraclete, as you find: “If any man sin, we have a Paraclete
\[Advocate\] with the Father, Jesus Christ.” <span
id="fr_963"></span>[964](#fn_963.md) So in like manner as there is a
oneness of name, so, too, is there a oneness of power, for where the
Paraclete Spirit is, there is also the Son.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xiv-p18"></span>158. For as the Lord says in this
place that the Spirit will be forever with the faithful, so, too, does
He elsewhere show that He will Himself be forever with the apostles,
saying: “Lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the world.” <span
id="fr_964"></span>[965](#fn_964.md) Therefore the Son and the Spirit are
one, the Name of the Trinity is one, and the Presence one and
indivisible.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xiv-p20"></span>159. But as we show that the Son is
called the Paraclete, so, too, do we show that the Spirit is called the
Truth. Christ is the Truth, the Spirit is the Truth, for you find in
John’s epistle: “For the Spirit is Truth.” <span
id="fr_965"></span>[966](#fn_965.md) Not only, then, is the Spirit called
the Spirit of Truth, but also the Truth, as the Son is also declared to
be the Truth, Who says: “I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life.” <span

[Next: Chapter XIV. Each Person of the Trinity is said in the sacred
writings to be Light. The Spirit is designated Fire by Isaiah, a figure
of which Fire was seen in the bush by Moses, in the tongues of fire, and
in Gideon's pitchers. And the Godhead of the same Spirit cannot be
denied, since His operation is the same as that of the Father and of the
Son, and He is also called the light and fire of the Lord's
countenance.](2100134.md)
