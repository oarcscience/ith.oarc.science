#### <span id="iv.iv.v.xvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVI.

<span id="iv.iv.v.xvi-p1"></span>In order to forearm the orthodox
against the stratagems of the Arians, St. Ambrose discloses some of the
deceitful confessions used by the latter, and shows by various
arguments, that though they sometimes call the Son “God,” it is not
enough, unless they also admit His equality with the Father.

<span id="iv.iv.v.xvi-p2"></span>129. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.v.xvi-p2.1"></span>Let</span> none fear, let none tremble; he
who threatens gives the advantage to the faithful. The soothing balms of
deceitful men are poisoned—then must we be on our guard against them,
when they pretend to preach that they do deny. Thus were those
aforetime, who lightly trusted to them, deceived, so that they fell into
the snares of treachery, when they thought all was good faith.

<span id="iv.iv.v.xvi-p3"></span>130. “Let him be accursed,” say they,
“who says that Christ is a creature, after the manner of the rest of
created beings.” Plain folks have heard this, and put faith in it, for,
as it is written, “the simple man believes every word.” <span
id="fr_2319"></span>[2320](#fn_2319.md) Thus have they heard and believed,
being taken in by the first sound thereof, and, like birds, eager for
the <span id="page_261">p. 261</span> <span
id="iv.iv.v.xvi-Page_261"></span>bait of faith, have not noted the net
spread for them, and so, pursuing after faith, have caught the hook of
ungodly deceit. Wherefore “be ye wise as serpents,” saith the Lord, “and
harmless as doves.” <span id="fr_2320"></span>[2321](#fn_2320.md) Wisdom is
put foremost, in order that harmlessness may be unharmed.

<span id="iv.iv.v.xvi-p6"></span>131. For those are serpents, such as
the Gospel intends, who put off old habits, in order to put on new
manners: “Putting off the old man, together with his acts, and putting
on the new man, made in the image of Him Who created him.” <span
id="fr_2321"></span>[2322](#fn_2321.md) Let us learn then, the ways of
those whom the Gospel calls the serpents, throwing off the slough of the
old man, that so, like serpents, we may know how to preserve our life
and beware of fraud.

<span id="iv.iv.v.xvi-p8"></span>132. It would have been sufficient to
say, “Accursed be he who saith that Christ is a created being.” Why,
then, Arian, dost thou mingle poison with the good that is in thy
confession, and so defile the whole body of it? For by addition of
“after the manner of the rest of created beings,” you deny not that
Christ is a being created, but that He is a created being like \[all\]
others—for created being you do entitle Him, albeit you assign to Him
dignity transcending the rest of creation. Furthermore, Arius, the first
teacher of this ungodly doctrine, said that the Son of God was a perfect
created being, and not as the rest of created beings. See you, then, how
that you have adopted language bequeathed you from your father. To deny
that Christ is a being created is enough: why add “but not as the rest
of beings created”? Cut away the gangrened part, lest the contagion
spread—it is poisonous, deadly.

<span id="iv.iv.v.xvi-p9"></span>133. Again, you say sometimes that
Christ is God. Nay, but so call Him true God, as meaning, that you
acknowledge Him to possess the fulness of the Father’s Godhead—for there
are gods, so called, alike in heaven or upon earth. The name “God,”
then, is not to be used as a mere manner of address and mention, but
with the understanding that you affirm, of the Son, that same Godhead
which the Father hath, as it is written: “For as the Father hath life in
Himself, so hath He given to the Son also to have life in
Himself;” <span id="fr_2322"></span>[2323](#fn_2322.md) that is to say, He
hath given it to Him, as to His Son, through begetting Him—not by grace,
as to one indigent.

<span id="iv.iv.v.xvi-p11"></span>134. “And He hath given Him power to
execute judgment, because He is the Son of Man.” <span
id="fr_2323"></span>[2324](#fn_2323.md) Note well this addition, that you
may not take occasion, upon a word, to preach falsehood. You read that
He is the Son of Man; do you therefore deny that He accepts \[the power
given\]? Deny God, then, if all things proper to God are not given to
the Son, for whereas He has said, “All things that the Father hath are
Mine,” <span id="fr_2324"></span>[2325](#fn_2324.md) why not acknowledge
that all the properties and attributes of Divinity are in the Son \[as
they are in the Father\]? For He who saith, “All things that the Father
hath are Mine,” what does He except as having not?

<span id="iv.iv.v.xvi-p14"></span>135. Why is it that you recount “with
insistence” and in such sincere language, Christ’s raising the dead to
life, walking upon the waters, healing the sicknesses of men? These
powers, indeed, He has given to His bondmen to display as well as
Himself. They do the more arouse my wonder when seen present in men,
forasmuch as God hath given them power so great. I would hear somewhat
concerning Christ that is His distinctly and peculiarly, and cannot be
held in common with Him by created beings, now that He is begotten, the
only Son of God, very God of very God, sitting at the Father’s right
hand.

<span id="iv.iv.v.xvi-p15"></span>136. Wheresoever I read of the Father
and Son sitting side by side, I find the Son always upon the right hand.
Is that because the Son is above the Father? Nay, we say not so; but He
Whom God’s love honours is dishonoured by man’s ungodliness. The Father
knew that doubts as concerning the Son must needs be sown, and He hath
given us an example of reverence for us to follow after, lest we
dishonour the Son.

Lord standing is disposed of, and from the prayers of the same saint,
addressed to the Son of God, the equality of the Son with the Father is
shown.](2100239.md)
