#### <span id="iv.ii.iii.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.v-p1"></span>The Holy Spirit gives life, not in a
different way from the Father and the Son, nor by a different working.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.v-p2"></span>29. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.ii.iii.v-p2.1"></span>And</span> what wonder is it the Spirit
works Life, Who quickens as does the Father and as does the Son? And who
can deny that quickening is the work of the Eternal Majesty? For it is
written: “Quicken Thy servant.” <span
id="fr_1043"></span>[1044](#fn_1043) He, then, is quickened who is a
servant, that is, man, who before had not life, but received the
privilege of having it.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.v-p4"></span>30. Let us then see whether the Spirit
is quickened, or Himself quickens. Now it is written: “The letter
killeth, but the Spirit giveth life.” <span
id="fr_1044"></span>[1045](#fn_1044) So, then, the Spirit quickens.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.v-p6"></span>31. But that you may understand that
the quickening of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit is no separate work,
read how there is a oneness of quickening also, since God Himself
quickens through the Spirit, for Paul said: “He Who raised up Christ
from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies because of His
Spirit Who dwelleth in you.”

[Next: Chapter V. The Holy Spirit, as well as the Father and the Son, is
pointed out in holy Scripture as Creator, and the same truth was
shadowed forth even by heathen writers, but it was shown most plainly in
the Mystery of the Incarnation, after touching upon which, the writer
maintains his argument from the fact that worship which is due to the
Creator alone is paid to the Holy Spirit.](2100143)
