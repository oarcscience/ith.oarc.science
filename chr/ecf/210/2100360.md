### <span id="iv.viii.xii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XI.

<span id="iv.viii.xii-p1"></span>Having shown that the pretexts usually
alleged for second marriages have no weight, St. Ambrose declares that
he does not condemn them, though from the Apostle’s words he sets forth
their inconveniences, though the state of those twice married is
approved in the Church, and he takes occasion to advert to those
heretics who forbid them. And he says that it is because the strength of
different persons varies that chastity is not commanded, but only
recommended.

<span id="iv.viii.xii-p2"></span>67. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.viii.xii-p2.1"></span>I say</span>, then, that widows who have
been in the habit of giving neither are in want of their necessary
expenses, nor of help, who in very great dangers have often guarded the
resources of their husbands; and further, I think that the good offices
of a husband are usually made up for to them by sons-in-law and other
relatives, and that God’s mercy is more ready to help them, and
therefore, when there is no special cause for marrying, the desire of so
doing should not exist.

<span id="iv.viii.xii-p3"></span>68. This, however, I say as a counsel,
we do not order it as a precept, stirring up the wills of widows rather
than binding them. For I do not forbid second marriages, only I do not
advise them. The consideration of human weakness is one thing, the grace
of chastity is another. I say more, I do not forbid second, but do not
approve of often repeated marriages, for not everything is expedient
which is lawful: “All things are lawful to me,” says the Apostle, “but
all things are not expedient.” <span
id="fr_3373"></span>[3374](#fn_3373.md) As, also, to drink wine is lawful,
but, for the most part, it is not expedient.

<span id="iv.viii.xii-p5"></span>69. It is then lawful to marry, but it
is more seemly to abstain, for there are bonds in marriage. Do you ask
what bonds? “The woman who is under a husband is bound by the law so
long as her husband liveth; but if her husband be dead she is loosed
from the law of her husband.” <span id="fr_3374"></span>[3375](#fn_3374.md)
It is then proved that marriage is a bond by which the woman is bound
and from which she is loosed. Beautiful is the grace of mutual love, but
the bondage is more constant. “The wife hath not power of her own body,
but the husband.” <span id="fr_3375"></span>[3376](#fn_3375.md) And lest
this bondage should seem to be rather one of sex than of marriage, there
follows: “Likewise, also, the husband hath not power of his own body,
but the wife.” How great; then, is the constraint in marriage, which
subjects even the stronger to the other; for by mutual constraint each
is bound to serve. Nor if one wishes to refrain can he withdraw his neck
from the yoke, for he is subject to the incontinence of the other. It is
said: “Ye are bought with a price, be <span id="page_403">p. 403</span>
<span id="iv.viii.xii-Page_403"></span>not ye servants of men.” <span
id="fr_3376"></span>[3377](#fn_3376.md) You see how plainly the servitude
of marriage is defined. It is not I who say this, but the Apostle; or,
rather, it is not he, but Christ, Who spoke in him. And he spoke of this
servitude in the case of good married people. For above you read: “The
unbelieving husband is sanctified by his believing wife; and the
unbelieving wife by her believing husband.” <span
id="fr_3377"></span>[3378](#fn_3377.md) And further on: “But if the
unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not bound
in such cases.” <span id="fr_3378"></span>[3379](#fn_3378.md) If, then, a
good marriage is servitude, what is a bad one, when they cannot
sanctify, but destroy one another?

<span id="iv.viii.xii-p11"></span>70. But as I exhort widows to keep the
grace of their gift, so, too, I incite women to observe ecclesiastical
discipline, for the Church is made up of all. Though it be the flock of
Christ, yet some are fed on strong food, others are still nourished with
milk, who must be on their guard against those wolves who are hidden in
sheep’s clothing, pretending to all appearance of continence, but
inciting to the foulness of incontinence. For they know how severe are
the burdens of chastity, since they cannot touch them with the tips of
their fingers; they require of others that which is above measure, when
they themselves cannot even observe any measure, but rather give way
under the cruel weight. For the measure of the burden must always be
according to the strength of him who has to bear it; otherwise, where
the bearer is weak, he breaks down with the burden laid upon him; for
too strong meat chokes the throats of infants.

<span id="iv.viii.xii-p12"></span>71. And so as in a multitude of
bearers their strength is not estimated by that of a few; nor do the
stronger receive their tasks in accordance with the weakness of others,
but each is allowed to bear as great a burden as he desires, the reward
increasing with the increase of strength; so, too, a snare is not to be
set for women, nor a burden of continence beyond their strength to be
taken up, but it must be left to each to weigh the matter for herself,
not compelled by the authority of any command, but incited by increase
of grace. And so for different degrees of virtue a different reward is
set forth, and one thing is not blamed that another may be praised; but
all are spoken of, in order that what is best may be preferred.
