#### <span id="iv.iv.iv.ii-p0.1"></span>Chapter I.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.ii-p1"></span>*The Arian argument from S.* <span
id="iv.iv.iv.ii-p1.1"></span>*[Mark x.
18](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#018.md)<span id="iv.iv.iv.ii-p1.2"></span>,
“There is none good but one, that is, God,” refuted by explanation of
these words of Christ.*

<span id="iv.iv.iv.ii-p2"></span>15. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.iv.ii-p2.1"></span>The</span> objection I have now to face,
your sacred Majesty, fills me with bewilderment, my soul and body faint
at the thought that there should be men, or rather not men, but beings
with the outward appearance of men, but inwardly full of brutish
folly—who can, after receiving at the hands of the Lord benefits so many
and so great, say that the Author of all good things is Himself not
good.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.ii-p3"></span>16. It is written, say they, that
“There is none good but God alone.” I acknowledge the Scripture—but
there is no falsehood in the letter; would that there were none in the
Arians’ exposition thereof. The written signs are guiltless, it is the
meaning in which they are taken <span
id="fr_1920"></span>[1921](#fn_1920.md) that is to blame. I <span
id="page_226">p. 226</span> <span
id="iv.iv.iv.ii-Page_226"></span>acknowledge the words as the words of
our Lord and Saviour—but let us bethink ourselves when, to whom, and
with what comprehension He speaks.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.ii-p5"></span>17. The Son of God is certainly
speaking as man, and speaking to a scribe,—to him, that is, who called
the Son of God “Good Master,” but would not acknowledge Him as God. What
he believes not, Christ further gives him to understand, to the end that
he may believe in God’s Son not as a good master, but as the good God,
for if, wheresoever the “One God” is named, the Son of God is never
sundered from the fulness of that unity, how, when God alone is said to
be good, can the Only-begotten be excluded from the fulness of Divine
Goodness? The Arians must therefore either deny that the Son of God is
God, or confess that God is good.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.ii-p6"></span>18. With divinely inspired
comprehension, then, our Lord said, *not* “There is none good but the
Father alone,” but “There is none good but God alone,” and “Father” is
the proper name of Him Who begets. But the unity of God by no means
excludes the Godhead of the Three Persons, and therefore it is His
Nature that is extolled. Goodness, therefore, is of the nature of God,
and in the nature of God, again, exists the Son of God—wherefore that
which the predicate expresses belongs not to one single Person, but to
the \[complete\] unity \[of the Godhead\]. <span
id="fr_1921"></span>[1922](#fn_1921.md)

<span id="iv.iv.iv.ii-p8"></span>19. The Lord, then, doth not deny His
goodness—He rebukes this sort of disciple. For when the scribe said,
“Good Master,” the Lord answered, “Why callest thou Me good?”—which is
to say, “It is not enough to call Him good, Whom thou believest not to
be God.” Not such do I seek to be My disciples—men who rather consider
My manhood and reckon Me a good master, than look to My Godhead and
believe Me to be the good God.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.ii-p4"></span> “*Sensus in crimine.*” The “sense of a
passage” is not something in the passage itself so much as our
understanding of it. In other words, the genitive after “sense” is
objective, not possessive.

<span id="fn_1921"></span>[226:1922](2100206.htm#fr_1921.md) <span
id="iv.iv.iv.ii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iv.iv.ii-p7"></span> Lat.—“*non quod singularitatis, sed
quod unitatis est, prædicatur.*” The Son is “in the nature of God”
inasmuch as the eternal Fatherhood of God implies an Eternal Son—His
eternal Love an eternal object of that Love.

[Next: Chapter II. The goodness of the Son of God is proved from His
works, namely, His benefits that He showed towards the people of Israel
under the Old Covenant, and to Christians under the New. It is to one's
own interest to believe in the goodness of Him Who is one's Lord and
Judge. The Father's testimony to the Son. No small number of the Jewish
people bear witness to the Son; the Arians therefore are plainly worse
than the Jews. The words of the Bride, declaring the same goodness of
Christ.](2100207.md)
