<span id="iv.iv.v.iii"></span>

#### <span id="iv.iv.v.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.

<span id="iv.iv.v.iii-p1"></span>*That the Father and the Son must not
be divided* <span id="fr_2123"></span>[2124](#fn_2123.md) *is proved by the
words of the Apostle, seeing that it is befitting to the Son that He
should be blessed, only Potentate, and immortal, by nature, that is, and
not by grace, as even the angels themselves are immortal, and that He
should dwell in the unapproachable light. How it is that the Father and
the Son are alike and equally said to be “alone.”*

<span id="iv.iv.v.iii-p3"></span>15. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.v.iii-p3.1"></span>When</span>, therefore, you read the Name
“God,” separate neither Father nor Son, for the Godhead of the Father
and the Son is one and the same, and therefore separate them not, when
you read the words “blessed and only Potentate,” <span
id="fr_2124"></span>[2125](#fn_2124.md) for the words are spoken of God,
even as you may read: “I charge thee before God, Who quickeneth all
things.” <span id="fr_2125"></span>[2126](#fn_2125.md) Christ also indeed
doth quicken, and therefore the Name of God is meetly given both to the
Father and to the Son, inasmuch as the effect of their activity is in
agreement. Let us go on to the words following: “I charge thee,” he
says, “before God, Who quickeneth all things, and Jesus Christ.” <span
id="fr_2126"></span>[2127](#fn_2126.md)

<span id="iv.iv.v.iii-p7"></span>16. The Word is in God, even as it is
written: “In God will I praise His Word.” <span
id="fr_2127"></span>[2128](#fn_2127.md) In God is His Eternal Power, even
Jesus; in \[speaking of\] God, therefore, the Apostle hath witnessed to
the unity of the Godhead, whilst by the Name of Christ he hath witnessed
to the sacrament of the Incarnation.

<span id="iv.iv.v.iii-p9"></span>17. Furthermore, to show that he hath
spoken of the Incarnation of Christ, he added: “Who bore witness under
Pontius Pilate with the good confession,” \[I charge thee\] “keep
undefiled the commandment, until the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ,
<span id="page_245">p. 245</span> <span
id="iv.iv.v.iii-Page_245"></span>Which in His own good time the blessed
and only Potentate shall manifest, the King of kings and Lord of lords,
Who alone hath immortality, and dwelleth in light unapproachable, Whom
no man hath seen, nor can see.” <span
id="fr_2128"></span>[2129](#fn_2128.md) Those words, then, are written with
regard to God, of which Name the dignity and truth are common to \[both
the Father and\] the Son.

<span id="iv.iv.v.iii-p11"></span>18. Why, then, should there be no
thought of the Son in this place, seeing that all these things hold good
of the Son also? If they do not so, then deny His Godhead, and so mayest
thou deny what is proper to be said of God. His Blessedness cannot be
denied, Who bestows blessings, for “Blessed are they whose iniquities
are forgiven.” <span id="fr_2129"></span>[2130](#fn_2129.md) He cannot but
be called “Blessed,” Who hath given us wholesome teaching, even as it is
written: “Which is according to the Gospel of the beauty of the Blessed
God.” <span id="fr_2130"></span>[2131](#fn_2130.md) His Power cannot be
denied, of Whom the Father saith: “I have laid help upon One that is
mighty.” <span id="fr_2131"></span>[2132](#fn_2131.md) And who dare refuse
to acknowledge Him to be immortal, when He Himself hath made others also
immortal, as it is written of the Wisdom of God: “By her shall I possess
immortality.” <span id="fr_2132"></span>[2133](#fn_2132.md)

<span id="iv.iv.v.iii-p16"></span>19. But the immortality of His Nature
is one thing, that of ours is another. Things perishable are not to be
compared to things divine. The Godhead is the one only Substance that
death cannot touch, and therefore it is that the Apostle, though knowing
both the \[human\] soul and angels to be immortal, declared that God
only had immortality. In truth, even the soul may die: “The soul that
sinneth, it shall die,” <span id="fr_2133"></span>[2134](#fn_2133.md) and
an angel is not absolutely immortal, his immortality depending on the
will of the Creator. <span id="fr_2134"></span>[2135](#fn_2134.md)

<span id="iv.iv.v.iii-p19"></span>20. Do not hastily reject this,
because Gabriel dies not, nor Raphaël, nor Uriel. <span
id="fr_2135"></span>[2136](#fn_2135.md) Even in their nature there is a
capacity of sin, though not one of improvement by discipline, <span
id="fr_2136"></span>[2137](#fn_2136.md) for every reasonable creature is
exposed to influences from without itself, and liable to judgment. It is
on the influences which work upon us that the award of judgment, and
corruption, or advance to perfection, do depend, and therefore
Ecclesiastes saith: “For God shall bring all His work to
judgment.” <span id="fr_2137"></span>[2138](#fn_2137.md) Every creature,
then, has within it the possibility of corruption and death, even though
it do not \[at present\] die or commit sin; nor, if in anything it
deliver not itself over to sin, hath it this boon of its immortal
nature, but of discipline or of grace. Immortality, then, that is of a
gift is one thing: immortality without the possibility of change is
another. <span id="fr_2138"></span>[2139](#fn_2138.md)

<span id="iv.iv.v.iii-p24"></span>21. Do we deny the immortality of
Christ’s Godhead, <span id="fr_2139"></span>[2140](#fn_2139.md) because He
tasted death for all in the flesh? Then is Gabriel better than Christ,
for Gabriel never died, but Christ gave up the ghost. But the servant is
not above his lord, <span id="fr_2140"></span>[2141](#fn_2140.md) and we
must discern the weakness of flesh from the eternity of Godhead.
Christ’s Death had its source in the flesh, immortality is of the nature
of Christ’s sovereignty. But if the Godhead brought it to pass that the
flesh saw not corruption, the flesh being surely by nature liable to
corruption, how could the Godhead itself have died?

<span id="iv.iv.v.iii-p27"></span>22. And how is it that the Son
dwelleth not in light unapproachable, if He is in the bosom of the
Father, if the Father is Light, and the Son also is Light, because God
is Light? <span id="fr_2141"></span>[2142](#fn_2141.md) Or, if we suppose
some other light, beside the Light of the Godhead, to be the
unapproachable Light, is, then, this Light better than the Father, so
that He is not in that Light, Who, as it is written, is both with the
Father and in the Father? <span id="fr_2142"></span>[2143](#fn_2142.md) Let
men, therefore, not exclude the thought of the Son, when they read only
of “*God*”—and let <span id="page_246">p. 246</span> <span
id="iv.iv.v.iii-Page_246"></span>them not exclude that of the Father,
when they read of “the *Son*” only. <span
id="fr_2143"></span>[2144](#fn_2143.md)

<span id="iv.iv.v.iii-p31"></span>23. On earth, the Son is not
without <span id="fr_2144"></span>[2145](#fn_2144.md) the Father, and thou
thinkest that the Father is without the Son in heaven? The Son is in the
flesh—(when I say “He is in the flesh” or “He is on earth,” I speak as
though we lived in the days whose story is in the Gospel, for now we no
longer know Christ “after the flesh” <span
id="fr_2145"></span>[2146](#fn_2145) .md)—He is in the flesh, and He is not
alone, as it is written: “And I am not alone, because the Father is with
Me,” <span id="fr_2146"></span>[2147](#fn_2146.md) and think you that the
Father dwells alone in the Light?

<span id="iv.iv.v.iii-p35"></span>24. Lest you should regard this
argument as mere speculation take this sentence of authority. “No man,”
saith the Scripture, <span id="fr_2147"></span>[2148](#fn_2147.md) “hath
seen God at any time, save the Only-begotten Son, Who is in the bosom of
the Father; He hath revealed Him.” <span
id="fr_2148"></span>[2149](#fn_2148.md) How can the Father be in solitude,
if the Son be in the bosom of the Father? How doth the Son reveal Him,
Whom He seeth not? The Father, then, exists not alone.

<span id="iv.iv.v.iii-p38"></span>25. Observe now what the “solitude” of
the Father and of the Son is. The Father is alone, because there is no
other Father; the Son is alone, because there is no other Son; God is
alone, because the Godhead of the Trinity is One.

<span id="iv.iv.v.iii-p18"></span> “That is to say, immortality is not
of the essential nature of an angel as it is of the essential Nature of
God. For God’s existence is such that He necessarily exists, He cannot
but exist; His existence is not derived from another, but is from the
power of His essential Nature, or rather is that very Nature. Not so
with the angel, whose existence is a gift of God, and so the angel’s
existence is no part of the idea of an angel, but is a property which
is, so to speak, added on from without and accessory to the conception
of such a being. Hence, in so far as an angel’s existence issues not of
the mere force of his essential properties, but only of the Creator’s
Will, we may say that by virtue of the said Will, not by force of his
own nature, he continues in existence, and so far is immortal, although
in another sense immortality may be called a natural property of an
angel, inasmuch as there is no created power whereby he may be
destroyed, and nothing in him that renders him liable to be destroyed by
God—nay rather, everything about him demands that, once he is created,
he should be for ever preserved in being.”—H.

<span id="fn_2135"></span>[245:2136](2100225.htm#fr_2135.md) <span
id="iv.iv.v.iii-p19.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iv.v.iii-p20"></span> Hurter observes that St. Ambrose
understands mortality in a wide sense, as including the capacity of any
and every sort of change. Immortality, then, in accordance with this
definition, would connote perfect absence of change. Hurter cites St.
Bernard, § 81 *in Cant.: “Omnis mutatio quædam mortis imitatio…Si tot
mortes quot mutationes, ubi immortalitas?”* and Plutarch, in Eusebius,
*Præpar. Ev.* XI. 12. Plutarch’s view perhaps owed something to study of
the reliques of Herachtus. Many fathers expounded [1 Tim. vi.
16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#016.md)<span id="iv.iv.v.iii-p20.1"></span>
on this definition of immortality as=immutability. This definition would
exclude angels, who are naturally fallible (as the rebellion of Lucifer
and the third part of the host of heaven proved)—or if they are *now* no
longer fallible, they owe it not to their own natural constitution but
to grace. In so far then as angels are mutable, whether for better or
worse, they are not immortal.

<span id="fn_2136"></span>[245:2137](2100225.htm#fr_2136.md) <span
id="iv.iv.v.iii-p20.2"></span>

<span id="iv.iv.v.iii-p21"></span> Angels being by nature mutable,
either for better or for worse, that is, capable of good or evil, and so
of death, are *de facto* sinless, and hence need not, are not meet to be
placed under, penal discipline. Or the meaning may be that the angelic
nature was not created to be gradually taught in the way of holiness as
human nature was.

14](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#014.md)<span
id="iv.iv.v.iii-p22.1"></span>. Hurter observes that God would not judge
rational creatures, were they not capable of advance or retrogression,
of becoming better or falling into degradation, and had, as a matter of
fact, advanced or fallen back.

[Next: Chapter IV. We are told that Christ was only “made” so far as
regards the flesh. For the redemption of mankind He needed no means of
aid, even as He needed none in order to His Resurrection, whereas
others, in order to raise the dead, had need of recourse to prayer. Even
when Christ prayed, the prayer was offered by Him in His capacity as
human; whilst He must be accounted divine from the fact that He
commanded (that such and such things should be done). On this point the
devil's testimony is truer than the Arians' arguments. The discussion
concludes with an explanation of the reason why the title of “mighty” is
given to the Son of Man.](2100226.md)
