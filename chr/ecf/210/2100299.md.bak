#### <span id="iv.vi.ii.xii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XII.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xii-p1"></span>Another passage of St. John is
considered. The necessity of keeping the commandments of God may be
complied with by those who, having fallen, repent, as well as by those
who have not fallen, as is shown in the case of David.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xii-p2"></span>53. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.xii-p2.1"></span>Let</span> us consider another similar
passage: “He that believeth on the Son hath eternal life, but he that
believeth not the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth
on him.” <span id="fr_2991"></span>[2992](#fn_2991.md) That which abideth
has certainly had a commencement, and that from some offence, viz., that
first he not believe. When, then, any one believes, the wrath of God
departs and life comes. To believe, then, in Christ is to gain life, for
“he that believeth in Him is not judged.” <span
id="fr_2992"></span>[2993](#fn_2992.md)

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xii-p5"></span>54. But with reference to this passage
they allege that he who believes in Christ ought to keep His sayings,
and say that it is written in the Lord’s own words: “I am come a light
into this world, that whosoever believeth in Me may not abide in
darkness. And if any man hear My word and keep it, I judge him
not.” <span id="fr_2993"></span>[2994](#fn_2993.md) He judges not, and do
you judge? He says, “that whosoever believeth on Me may not abide in
darkness,” that is, that if he be in darkness he may not remain therein,
but may amend his error, correct his fault, and keep My commandments,
for I have said, “I will not the death of the wicked, but the
correction.” <span id="fr_2994"></span>[2995](#fn_2994.md) I said above
that he that believeth on Me is not judged, and I keep to this: “For I
am not come to judge the world, but that the world may be saved through
Me.” <span id="fr_2995"></span>[2996](#fn_2995.md) I pardon willingly, I
quickly forgive, “I will have mercy rather than sacrifice,” <span
id="fr_2996"></span>[2997](#fn_2996.md) because by sacrifice the just is
rendered more acceptable, by mercy the sinner is redeemed. “I come not
to call the righteous but sinners.” <span
id="fr_2997"></span>[2998](#fn_2997.md) Sacrifice was under the Law, in the
Gospel is mercy. “The Law was given by Moses, grace by Me.” <span
id="fr_2998"></span>[2999](#fn_2998.md)

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xii-p12"></span>55. And again further on He says: “He
that despiseth Me, and receiveth not My words, hath one that judgeth
him.” <span id="fr_2999"></span>[3000](#fn_2999.md) Does he seem to you to
have received Christ’s words who has not corrected himself? Undoubtedly
not. He, then, who corrects himself receives His word, for this is His
word, that every one should turn back from sin. So, then, of necessity
you must either reject this saying of His, or if you cannot deny it you
must accept it.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xii-p14"></span>56. It is also necessary that he who
leaves off sinning must keep the commandments of God and renounce his
sins. We ought not, then, to interpret this saying of him who has always
kept the commandments, for if this had been His meaning He would have
added the word *always*, but by not adding it He shows that He was
speaking of him who has kept what he has heard, and what he heard has
led him to correct his faults; he has then kept what he has heard.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xii-p15"></span>57. But how hard it is to condemn to
penance for life one who even afterwards keeps the commandments of the
Lord, let Him teach us Himself Who has not refused forgiveness. Even to
those who do not keep His commandments, as you read in the <span
id="page_339">p. 339</span> <span
id="iv.vi.ii.xii-Page_339"></span>Psalm: “If they profane My statutes
and keep not My commandments, I will visit their offences with the rod
and their sins with scourges, but My mercy will I not take from
them.” <span id="fr_3000"></span>[3001](#fn_3000.md) So, then, He promises
mercy to all.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xii-p17"></span>58. Yet that we may not think that
this mercy is without judgment, there is a distinction made between
those who have paid continual obedience to God’s commandments, and those
who at some time, either by error or by compulsion, have fallen. And
that you may not think that it is only our arguments which press you,
consider the decision of Christ, Who said: “If the servant knew his
Lord’s will and did it not, he shall be beaten with many stripes, but if
he knew it not, he shall be beaten with few stripes.” <span
id="fr_3001"></span>[3002](#fn_3001.md) Each, then, if he believes, is
received, for God “chasteneth every son whom He receiveth,” <span
id="fr_3002"></span>[3003](#fn_3002.md) and him whom He chasteneth He does
not give over unto death, for it is written: “The Lord hath chastened me
sore, but He hath not given me over unto death.” <span
id="fr_3003"></span>[3004](#fn_3003.md)

[Next: Chapter XIII. They who have committed a “sin unto death” are not
to be abandoned, but subjected to penance, according to St. Paul.
Explanation of the phrase “Deliver unto Satan.” Satan can afflict the
body, but these afflictions bring spiritual profit, showing the power of
God, Who thus turns Satan's devices against himself.](2100300.md)
