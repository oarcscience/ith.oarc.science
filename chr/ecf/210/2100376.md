### <span id="v.xi-p0.1"></span>Letter LI.

<span id="v.xi-p1"></span>Addressed to the Emperor Theodosius after the
massacre at Thessalonica. <span id="fr_3617"></span>[3618](#fn_3617.md) St.
Ambrose begins by stating his reasons for not having met the Emperor on
his return to Milan. He then mentions the sentiments of the bishops with
regard to the slaughter at Thessalonica, and points out that repentance
for that deed is necessary to obtain forgiveness and a victory over the
devil, the instigator to that crime. St. Ambrose could not offer the
sacrifice in the Emperor’s presence, and, as truly loving the Emperor,
grieves and yet hopes.

<span id="v.xi-p3"></span>1. <span class="sc"><span
id="v.xi-p3.1"></span>The</span> memory of your old friendship is
pleasant to me, and I gratefully call to mind the kindnesses which, in
reply to my frequent intercessions, you have most graciously conferred
on others. Whence it may be inferred that I did not from any ungrateful
feeling avoid meeting you on your arrival, which I had always before
earnestly desired. And I will now briefly set forth the reason for my
acting as I did.

<span id="v.xi-p4"></span>2. I saw that from me alone in your court the
natural right of hearing was withdrawn, so that I was deprived also of
the office of speaking; for you were frequently troubled because certain
matters which had been decided in your consistory had come to my
knowledge. I, therefore, am without a part in the common privilege,
since the Lord Jesus says: “That nothing is hidden, which shall not be
made known.” <span id="fr_3618"></span>[3619](#fn_3618.md) I, therefore, as
reverently as I could, complied with the imperial will, and took heed
that neither yourself should have any reason for displeasure, when I
effected that nothing should be related to me of the imperial decrees;
and that I, when present, either should not hear, through fear of all
others, and so incur the reputation of connivance, or should hear in
such a fashion that my ears might be open, my utterance prevented, that
I might not be able to utter what I had heard lest I should injure and
bring in peril those who had incurred the suspicion of treachery.

<span id="v.xi-p6"></span>3. What, then, could I do? Should I not hear?
But I could not close my ears with the wax of the old fables. Should I
utter what I heard? But I was bound to be on my guard in my words
against that which I <span id="page_451">p. 451</span> <span
id="v.xi-Page_451"></span>feared in your commands, namely, lest some
deed of blood should be committed. Should I keep silence? But then my
conscience would be bound, my utterance taken away, which would be the
most wretched condition of all. And where would be that text? If the
priest speak not to him that erreth, he who errs shall die in his sin,
and the priest shall be liable to the penalty because he warned not the
erring. <span id="fr_3619"></span>[3620](#fn_3619.md)

<span id="v.xi-p8"></span>4. Listen, august Emperor. I cannot deny that
you have a zeal for the faith; I do confess that you have the fear of
God. But you have a natural vehemence, which, if any one endeavours to
soothe, you quickly turn to mercy; if any one stirs it up, you rouse it
so much more that you can scarcely restrain it. Would that if no one
soothe it, at least no one may inflame it! To yourself I willingly
entrust it, you restrain yourself, and overcome your natural vehemence
by the love of piety.

<span id="v.xi-p9"></span>5. This vehemence of yours I preferred to
commend privately to your own consideration, rather than possibly raise
it by any action of mine in public. And so I have preferred to be
somewhat wanting in duty rather than in humility, and that other, should
rather think me wanting in priestly authority than that you should find
me lacking in most loving reverence, that having restrained your
vehemence your power of deciding on your counsel should not be weakened.
I excuse myself by bodily sickness, which was in truth severe, and
scarcely to be lightened but by great care. Yet I would rather have died
than not wait two or three days for your arrival. But it was not
possible for me to do so.

<span id="v.xi-p10"></span>6. There was that done in the city of the
Thessalonians of which no similar record exists, which I was not able to
prevent happening; which, indeed, I had before said would be most
atrocious when I so often petitioned against it, and that which you
yourself show by revoking it too late you consider to be grave, <span
id="fr_3620"></span>[3621](#fn_3620.md) this I could not extenuate when
done. When it was first heard of, a synod had met because of the arrival
of the Gallican Bishops. There was not one who did not lament it, not
one who thought lightly of it; your being in fellowship with Ambrose was
no excuse for your deed. Blame for what had been done would have been
heaped more and more on me, had no one said that your reconciliation to
our God was necessary.

<span id="v.xi-p12"></span>7. Are you ashamed, O Emperor, to do that
which the royal prophet David, the forefather of Christ, according to
the flesh, did? To him it was told how the rich man who had many flocks
seized and killed the poor man’s one lamb, because of the arrival of his
guest, and recognizing that he himself was being condemned in the tale,
for that he himself had done it, he said: “I have sinned against the
Lord.” <span id="fr_3621"></span>[3622](#fn_3621.md) Bear it, then, without
impatience, O Emperor, if it be said to you: “You have done that which
was spoken of to King David by the prophet.” For if you listen
obediently to this, and say: “I have sinned against the Lord,” if you
repeat those words of the royal prophet: “O come let us worship and fall
down before Him, and mourn before the Lord our God, Who made us,” <span
id="fr_3622"></span>[3623](#fn_3622.md) it shall be said to you also:
“Since thou repentest, the Lord putteth away thy sin, and thou shalt not
die.” <span id="fr_3623"></span>[3624](#fn_3623.md)

<span id="v.xi-p16"></span>8. And again, David, after he had commanded
the people to be numbered, was smitten in heart, and said to the Lord:
“I have sinned exceedingly, because I have commanded this, and now, O
Lord, take away the iniquity of Thy servant, for I have transgressed
exceedingly.” <span id="fr_3624"></span>[3625](#fn_3624.md) And the prophet
Nathan was sent again to him, to offer him the choice of three things,
that he should select the one he chose—famine in the land for three
years, or that he should flee for three months before his enemies, or
mortal pestilence in the land for three days. And David answered: “These
three things are a great strait to me, but let me fall into the hand of
the Lord, for very many are His mercies, and let me not fall into the
hands of man.” <span id="fr_3625"></span>[3626](#fn_3625.md) Now his fault
was that he desired to know the number of the whole of the people which
was with him, which knowledge he ought to have left to God alone.

<span id="v.xi-p19"></span>9. And, we are told, when death came upon the
people, on the very first day at dinner time, when David saw the angel
smiting the people, he said: “I have sinned, and I, the shepherd, have
done wickedly, and this flock, what hath it done? Let Thine hand be upon
me, and upon my father’s house.” <span
id="fr_3626"></span>[3627](#fn_3626.md) And so it repented the Lord, and He
commanded the angel to spare the people, and David to offer a sacrifice,
for sacrifices were then offered for sins; sacrifices are now those of
penitence. And <span id="page_452">p. 452</span> <span
id="v.xi-Page_452"></span>so by that humbling of himself he became more
acceptable to God, for it is no matter of wonder that a man should sin,
but this is reprehensible, if he does not recognize that he has erred,
and humble himself before God.

<span id="v.xi-p21"></span>10. Holy Job, himself also powerful in this
world, says: “I hid not my sin, but declared it before all the
people.” <span id="fr_3627"></span>[3628](#fn_3627.md) His son Jonathan
said to the fierce King Saul himself: “Do not sin against thy servant
David;” <span id="fr_3628"></span>[3629](#fn_3628.md) and: “Why dost thou
sin against innocent blood, to slay David without a cause?” <span
id="fr_3629"></span>[3630](#fn_3629.md) For, although he was a king, yet he
would have sinned if he slew the innocent. And again, David also, when
he was in possession of the kingdom, and had heard that innocent Abner
had been slain by Joab, the leader of his host, said: “I am guiltless
and my kingdom is guiltless henceforth and for ever of the blood of
Abner, the son of Ner,” <span id="fr_3630"></span>[3631](#fn_3630.md) and
he fasted for sorrow.

<span id="v.xi-p26"></span>11. I have written this, not in order to
confound you, but that the examples of these kings may stir you up to
put away this sin from your kingdom, for you will do it away by humbling
your soul before God. You are a man, and it has come upon you, conquer
it. Sin is not done away but by tears and penitence. Neither angel can
do it, nor archangel. The Lord Himself, Who alone can say, “I am with
you,” <span id="fr_3631"></span>[3632](#fn_3631.md) if we have sinned, does
not forgive any but those who repent.

<span id="v.xi-p28"></span>12. I urge, I beg, I exhort, I warn, for it
is a grief to me, that you who were an example of unusual piety, who
were conspicuous for clemency, who would not suffer single offenders to
be put in peril, should not mourn that so many have perished. Though you
have waged battle most successfully, though in other matters, too, you
are worthy of praise, yet piety was ever the crown of your actions. The
devil envied that which was your most excellent possession. Conquer him
whilst you still possess that wherewith you may conquer. Do not add
another sin to your sin by a course of action which has injured many.

<span id="v.xi-p29"></span>13. I, indeed, though a debtor to your
kindness, for which I cannot be ungrateful, that kindness which has
surpassed that of many emperors, and has been equalled by one only; I, I
say, have no cause for a charge of contumacy against you, but have cause
for fear; I dare not offer the sacrifice if you intend to be present. Is
that which is not allowed after shedding the blood of one innocent
person, allowed after shedding the blood of many? I do not think so.

<span id="v.xi-p30"></span>14. Lastly, I am writing with my own hand
that which you alone may read. As I hope that the Lord will deliver me
from all troubles, I have been warned, not by man, nor through man, but
plainly by Himself that this is forbidden me. For when I was anxious, in
the very night in which I was preparing to set out, you appeared to me
in a dream to have come into the Church, and I was not permitted to
offer the sacrifice. I pass over other things, which I could have
avoided, but I bore them for love of you, as I believe. May the Lord
cause all things to pass peaceably. Our God gives warnings in many ways,
by heavenly signs, by the precepts of the prophets; by the visions even
of sinners He wills that we should understand, that we should entreat
Him to take away all disturbances, to preserve peace for you emperors,
that the faith and peace of the Church, whose advantage it is that
emperors should be Christians and devout, may continue.

<span id="v.xi-p31"></span>15. You certainly desire to be approved by
God. “To everything there is a time,” <span
id="fr_3632"></span>[3633](#fn_3632.md) as it is written: “It is time for
Thee, Lord, to work.” <span id="fr_3633"></span>[3634](#fn_3633.md) “It is
an acceptable time, O Lord.” <span id="fr_3634"></span>[3635](#fn_3634.md)
You shall then make your offering when you have received permission to
sacrifice, when your offering shall be acceptable to God. Would it not
delight me to enjoy the favour of the Emperor, to act according to your
wish, if the case allowed it? And prayer by itself is a sacrifice, it
obtains pardon, when the oblation would bring offence, for the one is a
sign of humility, the other of contempt. For the Word of God Himself
tells us that He prefers the performance of His commandments to the
offering of sacrifice. God proclaims this, Moses declares it to the
people, Paul preaches it to the Gentiles. Do that which you understand
is most profitable for the time. “I prefer mercy,” it is said, “rather
than sacrifice.” <span id="fr_3635"></span>[3636](#fn_3635.md) Are they
not, then, rather Christians in truth who condemn their own sin, than
they who think to defend it? “The just is an accuser of himself in the
beginning of his words.” <span id="fr_3636"></span>[3637](#fn_3636.md) He
who accuses himself when he has sinned is just, not he who praises
himself.

<span id="v.xi-p37"></span>16. I wish, O Emperor, that before this I
<span id="page_453">p. 453</span> <span id="v.xi-Page_453"></span>had
trusted rather to myself, than to your habits. When I consider that you
quickly pardon, and quickly revoke your sentence, as you have often
done; you have been anticipated, and I have not shunned that which I
needed not to fear. But thanks be to the Lord, Who willeth to chastise
His servants, that He may not lose them. This I have in common with the
prophets, and you shall have it in common with the saints.

<span id="v.xi-p38"></span>17. Shall I not value the father of Gratian
more than my very eyes? Your other holy pledges also claim pardon. I
conferred beforehand a dear name on those to whom I bore a common love.
I follow you with my love, my affection, and my prayers. If you believe
me, be guided by me; if, I say, you believe me, acknowledge what I say;
if you believe me not, pardon that which I do, in that I set God before
you. May you, most august Emperor, with your holy offspring, enjoy
perpetual peace with perfect happiness and prosperity.

<span id="v.xi-p2"></span> The mob at Thessalonica had barbarously
murdered a number of the officers of the garrison of that city. The
Emperor, being exceedingly angry, sent orders in obedience to which over
seven thousand of the inhabitants were cruelly put to death. This act of
vengeance shocked the public conscience, and St. Ambrose felt it his
duty to speak out in the name of the Church.
