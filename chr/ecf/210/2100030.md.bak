<span id="iv.i.ii.xviii"></span>

#### <span id="iv.i.ii.xviii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xviii-p1"></span>On the different functions of
modesty. How it should qualify both speech and silence, accompany
chastity, commend our prayers to God, govern our bodily motions; on
which last point reference is made to two clerics in language by no
means unsuited to its object. Further he proceeds to say that one’s gait
should be in accordance with that same virtue, and how careful one must
be that nothing immodest come forth from one’s mouth, or be noticed in
one’s body. All these points are illustrated with very appropriate
examples.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xviii-p2"></span>67. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.ii.xviii-p2.1"></span>Lovely</span>, then, is the virtue of
modesty, and sweet is its grace! It is seen not only in actions, but
even in our words, <span id="fr_114"></span>[115](#fn_114.md) so that we
may not go beyond due measure in speech, and that our words may not have
an unbecoming sound. The mirror of our mind often enough reflects its
image in our words. Sobriety weighs out the sound even of our voice, for
fear that too loud a voice should offend the ear of any one. Nay, in
singing itself the first rule is modesty, and the same is true in every
kind of speech, too, so that a man may gradually learn to praise God, or
to sing songs, or even to speak, in that the principles of modesty grace
his advance.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xviii-p4"></span>68. Silence, again, wherein all the
other <span id="page_13">p. 13</span> <span
id="iv.i.ii.xviii-Page_13"></span>virtues rest, is the chief act of
modesty. Only, if it is supposed to be a sign of a childish or proud
spirit, it is accounted a reproach; if a sign of modesty, it is reckoned
for praise. Susanna was silent in danger, <span
id="fr_115"></span>[116](#fn_115.md) and thought the loss of modesty was
worse than loss of life. She did not consider that her safety should be
guarded at the risk of her chastity. To God alone she spoke, to Whom she
could speak out in true modesty. She avoided looking on the face of men.
For there is also modesty in the glance of the eye, which makes a woman
unwilling to look upon men, or to be seen by them.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xviii-p6"></span>69. Let no one suppose that this
praise belongs to chastity alone. For modesty is the companion of
purity, in company with which chastity itself is safer. Shame, again, is
good as a companion and guide of chastity, inasmuch as it does not
suffer purity to be defiled in approaching even the outskirts of danger.
This it is that, at the very outset of her recognition, commends the
Mother of the Lord to those who read the Scriptures, and, as a credible
witness, declares her worthy to be chosen to such an office. For when in
her chamber, alone, she is saluted by the angel, she is silent, and is
disturbed at his entrance, <span id="fr_116"></span>[117](#fn_116.md) and
the Virgin’s face is troubled at the strange appearance of a man’s form.
And so, though she was humble, yet it was not because of this, but on
account of her modesty, that she did not return his salutation, nor give
him any answer, except to ask, when she had learnt that she should
conceive the Lord, how this should be. She certainly did not speak
merely for the sake of making a reply.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xviii-p8"></span>70. In our very prayers, too, modesty
is most pleasing, and gains us much grace from our God. Was it not this
that exalted the publican, and commended him, when he dared not raise
even his eyes to heaven? <span id="fr_117"></span>[118](#fn_117.md) So he
was justified by the judgment of the Lord rather than the Pharisee, whom
overweening pride made so hideous. “Therefore let us pray in the
incorruptibility of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of
God of great price,” <span id="fr_118"></span>[119](#fn_118.md) as St.
Peter says. A noble thing, then, is modesty, which, though giving up its
rights, seizing on nothing for itself, laying claim to nothing, and in
some ways somewhat retiring within the sphere of its own powers, yet is
rich in the sight of God, in Whose sight no man is rich. Rich is
modesty, for it is the portion of God. Paul also bids that prayer be
offered up with modesty and sobriety. <span
id="fr_119"></span>[120](#fn_119.md) He desires that this should be first,
and, as it were, lead the way of prayers to come, so that the sinner’s
prayer may not be boastful, but veiled, as it were, with the blush of
shame, may merit a far greater degree of grace, in giving way to modesty
at the remembrance of its fault.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xviii-p12"></span>71. Modesty must further be guarded
in our very movements and gestures and gait. <span
id="fr_120"></span>[121](#fn_120.md) For the condition of the mind is often
seen in the attitude of the body. For this reason the hidden man of our
heart (our inner self) is considered to be either frivolous, boastful,
or boisterous, or, on the other hand, steady, firm, pure, and
dependable. Thus the movement of the body is a sort of voice of the
soul.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xviii-p14"></span>72. Ye remember, my children, that a
friend of ours who seemed to recommend himself by his assiduity in his
duties, yet was not admitted by me into the number of the clergy,
because his gestures were too unseemly. Also that I bade one, whom I
found already among the clergy, never to go in front of me, because he
actually pained me by the seeming arrogance of his gait. That is what I
said when he returned to his duty after an offence committed. This alone
I would not allow, nor did my mind deceive me. For both have left the
Church. What their gait betrayed them to be, such were they proved to be
by the faithlessness of their hearts. The one forsook his faith at the
time of the Arian troubles; the other, through love of money, denied
that he belonged to us, so that he might not have to undergo sentence at
the hands of the Church. In their gait was discernible the semblance of
fickleness, the appearance, as it were, of wandering buffoons.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xviii-p15"></span>73. Some there are who in walking
perceptibly copy the gestures of actors, <span
id="fr_121"></span>[122](#fn_121.md) and act as though they were bearers in
the processions, and had the motions of nodding statues, to such an
extent that they seem to keep a sort of time, as often as they change
their step.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xviii-p17"></span>74. Nor do I think it becoming to
walk hurriedly, except when a case of some danger demands it, or a real
necessity. For we often see those who hurry come up panting, and with
features distorted. But if there is no reason for the need of such
hurry, it gives cause for just offence. I am not, however, <span
id="page_14">p. 14</span> <span
id="iv.i.ii.xviii-Page_14"></span>talking of those who have to hurry now
and then for some particular reason, but of those to whom, by the yoke
of constant habit, it has become a second nature. In the case of the
former I cannot approve of their slow solemn movements, which remind one
of the forms of phantoms. Nor do I care for the others with their
headlong speed, for they put one in mind of the ruin of outcasts.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xviii-p18"></span>75. A suitable gait is that wherein
there is an appearance of authority and weight and dignity, and which
has a calm collected bearing. But it must be of such a character that
all effort and conceit may be wanting, and that it be simple and plain.
Nothing counterfeit is pleasing. Let nature train our movements. If
indeed there is any fault in our nature, let us mend it with diligence.
And, that artifice may be wanting, let not amendment be wanting.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xviii-p19"></span>76. But if we pay so much attention
to things like these, how much more careful ought we to be to let
nothing shameful proceed out of our mouth, for that defiles a man
terribly. It is not food that defiles, but unjust disparagement of
others and foul words. <span id="fr_122"></span>[123](#fn_122.md) These
things are openly shameful. In our office indeed must no word be let
fall at all unseemly, nor one that may give offence to modesty. But not
only ought we to say nothing unbecoming to ourselves, but we ought not
even to lend our ears to words of this sort. Thus Joseph fled and left
his garment, that he might hear nothing inconsistent with his
modesty. <span id="fr_123"></span>[124](#fn_123.md) For he who delights to
listen, urges the other on to speak.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xviii-p22"></span>77. To have full knowledge of what
is foul is in the highest degree shameful. To see anything of this sort,
if by chance it should happen, how dreadful that is! What, therefore, is
displeasing to us in others, can that be pleasing in ourselves? Is not
nature herself our teacher, who has formed to perfection every part of
our body, so as to provide for what is necessary and to beautify and
grace its form? However she has left plain and open to the sight those
parts which are beautiful to look upon; among which, the head, set as it
were above all, and the pleasant lines of the figure, and the appearance
of the face are prominent, whilst their usefulness for work is ready to
hand. But those parts in which there is a compliance with the
necessities of nature, she has partly put away and hidden in the body
itself, lest they should present a disgusting appearance, and partly,
too, she has taught and persuaded us to cover them. <span
id="fr_124"></span>[125](#fn_124.md)

<span id="iv.i.ii.xviii-p24"></span>78. Is not nature herself then a
teacher of modesty? Following her example, the modesty of men, which I
suppose <span id="fr_125"></span>[126](#fn_125.md) is so called from the
mode of knowing what is seemly, <span id="fr_126"></span>[127](#fn_126.md)
has covered and veiled what it has found hid in the frame of our body;
like that door which Noah was bidden to make in the side of the
ark; <span id="fr_127"></span>[128](#fn_127.md) wherein we find a figure of
the Church, and also of the human body, for through that door the
remnants of food were cast out. Thus the Maker of our nature so thought
of our modesty, and so guarded what was seemly and virtuous in our body,
as to place what is unseemly behind, and to put it out of the sight of
our eyes. Of this the Apostle says well: “Those members of the body
which seem to be more feeble are necessary, and those members of the
body which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more
abundant honour, and our uncomely parts have more abundant
comeliness.” <span id="fr_128"></span>[129](#fn_128.md) Truly, by following
the guidance of nature, diligent care has added to the grace of the
body. In another place <span id="fr_129"></span>[130](#fn_129.md) I have
gone more fully into this subject, and said that not only do we hide
those parts which have been given us to hide, but also that we think it
unseemly to mention by name their description, and the use of those
members.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xviii-p30"></span>79. And if these parts are exposed
to view by chance, modesty is violated; but if on purpose, it is
reckoned as utter shamelessness. Wherefore Ham, Noah’s son, brought
disgrace upon himself; for he laughed when he saw his father naked, but
they who covered their father received the gift of a blessing. <span
id="fr_130"></span>[131](#fn_130.md) For which cause, also, it was an
ancient custom in Rome, and in many other states as well, that grown-up
sons should not bathe with their parents, or sons-in-law with their
fathers-in-law, <span id="fr_131"></span>[132](#fn_131.md) in order that
the great duty of reverence for parents should not be weakened. Many,
however, cover themselves so far as they can in the baths, so that,
where the whole body is bare, that part of it at least may be covered.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xviii-p33"></span>80. The priests, also, under the old
law, as we read in Exodus, wore breeches, as it was told Moses by the
Lord: “And thou shalt make them linen breeches to cover their shame:
from the loins even to the thighs they shall reach, and Aaron and his
sons shall wear them, when they enter into the tabernacle of witness,
and when they <span id="page_15">p. 15</span> <span
id="iv.i.ii.xviii-Page_15"></span>come unto the altar of the holy place
to offer sacrifice, that they lay not sin upon themselves and
die.” <span id="fr_132"></span>[133](#fn_132.md) Some of us are said still
to observe this, but most explain it spiritually, and suppose it was
said with a view to guarding modesty and preserving chastity.
