#### <span id="iv.iv.vii.xii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XI.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xii-p1"></span>We must refer the fact that Christ is
said to speak nothing of Himself, to His human nature. After explaining
how it is right to say that He hears and sees the Father as being God,
He shows conclusively, by a large number of proofs, that the Son of God
is not a creature.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xii-p2"></span>132. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.vii.xii-p2.1"></span>Are</span> we indeed to bring the Son of
God to such a low estate that He may not know how to act or speak,
except as He hears, and are we to suppose that a fixed measure of action
or of speech is assigned to Him, because it is written: “I speak not of
Myself,” and, further on: “As the Father hath said unto Me, even so I
speak”? <span id="fr_2695"></span>[2696](#fn_2695.md) But those words have
reference to the obedience of the flesh, or else to the faith in the
Unity. For many learned men allow that the Son hears, and that the
Father speaks to the Son through the unity of their Nature; for that
which the Son, through the unity of their will, knows that the Father
wills, He seems to have heard.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xii-p4"></span>133. Whereby is meant no personal
duty, but an indivisible sentence of co-operation. For this does not
signify any actual hearing of words, but the unity of will and of power,
which exists both in the Father and in the Son. He has stated that this
exists also in the Holy Spirit, in another place, saying, “For He shall
not speak of Himself, but whatsoever He shall hear, that shall He
speak,” <span id="fr_2696"></span>[2697](#fn_2696.md) so that we may learn
that whatsoever the Spirit says, the Son also says; and whatsoever the
Son says, the Father says also; for there is one mind and one mode of
working in the Trinity. For, as the Father is seen in the Son, not
indeed in bodily appearance, but in the unity of the Godhead, so also
the Father speaks in the Son, not with a voice of earth, not with a
human sound, but in the unity of Their work. So when He had said: “The
Father that dwelleth in Me, He speaketh; and the works that I do, He
doeth;” <span id="fr_2697"></span>[2698](#fn_2697.md) He added: “Believe
Me, that I am in the Father, and the Father in Me; or else believe Me
for the very work’s sake.” <span id="fr_2698"></span>[2699](#fn_2698.md)

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xii-p8"></span>134. This is what we understand
according to the whole course of the holy Scriptures; but the Arians,
who will not think of God the things that be right, may be put to
silence by an example just suited to their deserts; that they may not
believe everything in carnal fashion, since they themselves do not see
the works of their father the devil with bodily eyes. So the Lord has
declared of their fellows the Jews, saying: “Ye do what ye have seen
your father doing;” <span id="fr_2699"></span>[2700](#fn_2699.md) though
they are reproved not because they saw the work of the devil, but
because they did his will, since the devil unseen works out sin in them
in accordance with their own wickedness. We have written this, as the
Apostle did, because of the folly of these traitors. <span
id="fr_2700"></span>[2701](#fn_2700.md)

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xii-p11"></span>135. But we have sufficiently proved
by examples from Scripture that it is a property of the unity of the
divine majesty that the Father should abide in the Son, and that the Son
should seem to have heard from the Father those things which He speaks.
How else can we understand the unity of majesty than by the knowledge
that the same deference is paid to the Father and the Son? For what can
be better put than the Apostle’s saying that the Lord of glory was
crucified? <span id="fr_2701"></span>[2702](#fn_2701.md)

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xii-p13"></span>136. The Son then is the God of
glory and the Lord of glory, but glory is not subject to creatures; the
Son therefore is not a creature.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xii-p14"></span>137. The Son is the Image of the
Father’s Substance; <span id="fr_2702"></span>[2703](#fn_2702.md) but every
creature is unlike that divine Substance, but the Son of the Father is
not unlike God; therefore the Son is not a creature.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xii-p16"></span>138. The Son thought it not robbery
to be equal with God; <span id="fr_2703"></span>[2704](#fn_2703.md) but no
creature is equal with God, the Son, however, is equal; therefore the
Son is not a creature.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xii-p18"></span>139. Every creature is changeable;
but the Son of God is not changeable; therefore the Son of God is not a
creature.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xii-p19"></span>140. Every creature meets with
chance occurrences of good and evil after the powers of its nature, and
also feels their passing away; but nothing can pass away from or bring
addition to the Son of God in His Godhead; therefore the Son of God is
not a creature.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xii-p20"></span>141. Every work of His God will
bring into judgment; <span id="fr_2704"></span>[2705](#fn_2704.md) but the
Son of God is not brought into judgment; for He Himself judges;
therefore the Son of God is not a creature.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xii-p22"></span>142. Lastly, that thou mayest
understand the unity, the Saviour in speaking of His sheep says: “No man
is able to pluck them out of My hand. My Father Which gave them to Me is
greater than all, and no man is able to pluck them out of My Father’s
hand. I and My Father are one.” <span
id="fr_2705"></span>[2706](#fn_2705.md)

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xii-p24"></span>143. So the Son gives life as does
the <span id="page_302">p. 302</span> <span
id="iv.iv.vii.xii-Page_302"></span>Father. “For as the Father raiseth up
the dead and quickeneth them, even so the Son quickeneth whom He
will.” <span id="fr_2706"></span>[2707](#fn_2706.md) So the Son raises up
as does the Father: so too the Son preserves as does the Father. He Who
is not unequal in grace, how is He unequal in power? So also the Son
does not destroy, as neither does the Father. Therefore lest any one
should believe there were two Gods, or should imagine a diversity of
power, He said that He was one with His Father. How can a creature say
that? Therefore the Son of God is not a creature.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xii-p26"></span>144. It is not the same thing to
rule as to serve; but Christ is both a King and the Son of a King. The
Son of God therefore is not a servant. Every creature, however, gives
service. But the Son of God, Who makes servants become the sons of God,
does not give service. Therefore the Son of God is not a servant.

[Next: Chapter XII. He confirms what has been already said, by the
parable of the rich man who went into a far country to receive for
himself a kingdom; and shows that when the Son delivers up the kingdom
to the Father, we must not regard the fact that the Father is said to
put all things in subjection under Him, in a disparaging way. Here we
are the kingdom of Christ, and in Christ's kingdom. Hereafter we shall
be in the kingdom of God, where the Trinity will reign
together.](2100266.md)
