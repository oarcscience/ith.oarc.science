### <span id="iv.v.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.

<span id="iv.v.v-p1"></span>That water does not cleanse without the
Spirit is shown by the witness of John and by the very form of the
administration of the sacrament. And this is also declared to be
signified by the pool in the Gospel and the man who was there healed. In
the same passage, too, is shown that the Holy Spirit truly descended on
Christ at His baptism, and the meaning of this mystery is explained.

<span id="iv.v.v-p2"></span>19. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.v-p2.1"></span>The</span> reason why you were told before not
to believe only what you saw was that you might not say perchance, This
is that great mystery “which eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither
has it entered into the heart of man.” <span
id="fr_2846"></span>[2847](#fn_2846) I see water, which I have been used
to see every day. Is that water to cleanse me now in which I have so
often bathed without ever being cleansed? By this you may recognize that
water does not cleanse without the Spirit.

<span id="iv.v.v-p4"></span>20. Therefore read that the three witnesses
in baptism, the water, the blood, and the Spirit, <span
id="fr_2847"></span>[2848](#fn_2847) are one, for if you take away one
of these, the Sacrament of Baptism does not exist. For what is water
without the cross of Christ? A common element, without any sacramental
effect. Nor, again, is there the Sacrament of Regeneration without
water: “For except a man be born again of water and of the Spirit, he
cannot enter into the kingdom of God.” <span
id="fr_2848"></span>[2849](#fn_2848) Now, even the catechumen believes
in the cross of the Lord Jesus, wherewith he too is signed; but unless
he be baptized in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the
Holy Spirit, he cannot receive remission of sins nor gain the gift of
spiritual grace.

<span id="iv.v.v-p7"></span>21. So that Syrian dipped himself seven
times <span id="fr_2849"></span>[2850](#fn_2849) under the law, but you
were baptized in the Name of the Trinity, you confessed the Father. Call
to mind what you did: you confessed the Son, you confessed the Holy
Spirit. Mark well the order of things in this faith: you died to the
world, <span id="page_320">p. 320</span> <span
id="iv.v.v-Page_320"></span>and rose again to God. And as though buried
to the world in that element, being dead to sin, you rose again to
eternal life. Believe, therefore, that these waters are not void of
power.

<span id="iv.v.v-p9"></span>22. Therefore it is said: “An angel of the
Lord went down according to the season into the pool, and the water was
troubled; and he who first after the troubling of the water went down
into the pool was healed of whatsoever disease he was holden.” <span
id="fr_2850"></span>[2851](#fn_2850) This pool was at Jerusalem, in
which one was healed every year, but no one was healed before the angel
had descended. Because of those who believed not the water was troubled
as a sign that the angel had descended. They had a sign, you have faith;
for them an angel descended, for you the Holy Spirit; for them the
creature was troubled, for you Christ Himself, the Lord of the creature,
works.

<span id="iv.v.v-p11"></span>23. Then one was healed, now all are made
whole; or more exactly, the Christian people alone, for in some even the
water is deceitful. <span id="fr_2851"></span>[2852](#fn_2851) The
baptism of unbelievers heals not but pollutes. The Jew washes pots and
cups, as though things without sense were capable of guilt or grace. But
do you wash this living cup of yours, that in it your good works may
shine and the glory of your grace be bright. For that pool was as a
type, that you might believe that the power of God descends upon this
font.

<span id="iv.v.v-p13"></span>24. Lastly, that paralytic was waiting for
a man. And what man save the Lord Jesus, born of the Virgin, at Whose
coming no longer the shadow should heal men one by one, but the truth
should heal the whole. He it is, then, Whose coming down was being
waited for, of Whom the Father said to John the Baptist: “Upon Whom thou
shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding upon Him, this is He Who
baptizeth with the Holy Spirit.” <span
id="fr_2852"></span>[2853](#fn_2852) And John bare witness of Him, and
said: “I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove and abiding
upon Him.” <span id="fr_2853"></span>[2854](#fn_2853) And why did the
Spirit descend like a dove, but in order that you might see, that you
might acknowledge, that that dove also which just Noah sent forth from
the ark was a likeness of this dove, that you might recognize the type
of the sacrament?

<span id="iv.v.v-p16"></span>25. Perhaps you may object: Since that was
a real dove which was sent forth, and the Spirit descended like a dove,
how is it that we say that the likeness was there and the reality here,
whereas in the Greek it is written that the Spirit descended in the
likeness of a dove? But what is so real as the Godhead which abides for
ever? Now the creature cannot be the reality, but only a likeness, which
is easily destroyed and changed. So, again, because the simplicity of
those who are baptized ought to be not in appearance but in reality, and
the Lord says: “Be ye wise as serpents and simple as doves.” <span
id="fr_2854"></span>[2855](#fn_2854) Rightly, then, did He descend like
a dove, in order to admonish us that we ought to have the simplicity of
the dove. And further we read of the likeness being put for the reality,
both as regards Christ: “And was found in likeness as a man;” <span
id="fr_2855"></span>[2856](#fn_2855) and as regards God the Father: “Nor
have ye seen His likeness.” <span id="fr_2856"></span>[2857](#fn_2856)
