<span id="iv.i.iii.v"></span>

#### <span id="iv.i.iii.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.

<span id="iv.i.iii.v-p1"></span>Those things which are generally looked
on as good are mostly hindrances to a blessed life, and those which are
looked on as evil are the materials out of which virtues grow. What
belongs to blessedness is shown by other examples.

<span id="iv.i.iii.v-p2"></span>16. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.iii.v-p2.1"></span>But</span> those things which seem to be
good, as riches, abundance, joy without pain, are a hindrance to the
fruits of blessedness, as is clearly stated in the Lord’s own words,
when He said: “Woe to you rich, for ye have received your consolation!
Woe unto you that are full, for ye shall hunger, and to those who laugh,
for they shall mourn!” <span id="fr_400"></span>[401](#fn_400.md) So, then,
corporal or external good things are not only no assistance to attaining
a blessed life, but are even a hindrance to it.

<span id="iv.i.iii.v-p4"></span>17. Wherefore Naboth was blessed, even
though he was stoned by the rich; weak and poor, as opposed to the royal
resources, he was rich in his aim and his religion; so rich, indeed,
that he would not exchange the inheritance of the vineyard received from
his father for the king’s money; and on this account was he perfect, for
he defended the rights of his forefathers with his own blood. Thus,
also, Ahab was wretched on his own showing, for he caused the poor man
to be put to death, so as to take possession of his vineyard
himself. <span id="fr_401"></span>[402](#fn_401.md)

<span id="iv.i.iii.v-p6"></span>18. It is quite certain that virtue is
the only and the highest good; that it alone richly abounds in the fruit
of a blessed life; that a blessed life, by means of which eternal life
is won, does not depend on external or corporal benefits, but on virtue
only. A blessed life is the fruit of the present, and eternal life is
the hope of the future.

<span id="iv.i.iii.v-p7"></span>19. Some, however, there are who think a
blessed life is impossible in this body, weak and fragile as it is. For
in it one must suffer pain and grief, one must weep, one must be ill. So
I could also say that a blessed life rests on bodily rejoicing, but not
on the heights of wisdom, on the sweetness of conscience, or on the
loftiness of virtue. It is not a blessed thing to be in the midst of
suffering; but it is blessed to be victorious over it, and not to be
cowed by the power of temporal pain.

<span id="iv.i.iii.v-p8"></span>20. Suppose that things come which are
accounted terrible as regards the grief they cause, such as blindness,
exile, hunger, violation of a daughter, loss of children. Who will deny
that Isaac was blessed, who did not see in his old age, and yet gave
blessings with his benediction? <span id="fr_402"></span>[403](#fn_402.md)
Was not Jacob blessed who, leaving his father’s house, endured exile as
a shepherd for pay, <span id="fr_403"></span>[404](#fn_403.md) and mourned
for the violated chastity of his daughter, <span
id="fr_404"></span>[405](#fn_404.md) and suffered hunger? <span
id="fr_405"></span>[406](#fn_405.md) Were they not blessed on whose good
faith God received witness, as it is written: “The God of Abraham, the
God of Isaac, and the <span id="page_47">p. 47</span> <span
id="iv.i.iii.v-Page_47"></span>God of Jacob”? <span
id="fr_406"></span>[407](#fn_406.md) A wretched thing is slavery, but
Joseph was not wretched; nay, clearly he was blessed, when he whilst in
slavery checked the lusts of his mistress. <span
id="fr_407"></span>[408](#fn_407.md) What shall I say of holy David who
bewailed the death of three sons, <span
id="fr_408"></span>[409](#fn_408.md) and, what was even worse than this,
his daughter’s incestuous connection? <span
id="fr_409"></span>[410](#fn_409.md) How could he be unblessed from whom
the Author of blessedness Himself sprung, Who has made many blessed?
For: “Blessed are they who have not seen yet have believed.” <span
id="fr_410"></span>[411](#fn_410.md) All these felt their own weakness, but
they bravely prevailed over it. What can we think of as more wretched
than holy Job, either in the burning of his house, or the instantaneous
death of his ten sons, or his bodily pains? <span
id="fr_411"></span>[412](#fn_411.md) Was he less blessed than if he had not
endured those things whereby he really showed himself approved?

<span id="iv.i.iii.v-p19"></span>21. True it is that in these sufferings
there is something bitter, and that strength of mind cannot hide this
pain. I should not deny that the sea is deep because inshore it is
shallow, nor that the sky is clear because sometimes it is covered with
clouds, nor that the earth is fruitful because in some places there is
but barren ground, nor that the crops are rich and full because they
sometimes have wild oats mingled with them. So, too, count it as true
that the harvest of a happy conscience may be mingled with some bitter
feelings of grief. In the sheaves of the whole of a blessed life, if by
chance any misfortune or bitterness has crept in, is it not as though
the wild oats were hidden, or as though the bitterness of the tares was
concealed by the sweet scent of the corn? But let us now proceed again
with our subject.
