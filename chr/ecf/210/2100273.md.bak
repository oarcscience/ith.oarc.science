#### <span id="iv.iv.vii.xx-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIX.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xx-p1"></span>The Saint having turned to God the
Father, explains why he does not deride that the Son is inferior to the
Father, then he declares it is not for him to measure the Son of God,
since it was given to an angel—nay, perhaps even to Christ as man—to
measure merely Jerusalem. Arius, he says, has shown himself to be an
imitator of Satan. It is a rash thing to hold discussions on the divine
Generation. Since so great a sign of human generation has been given by
Isaiah, we ought not to make comparisons in divine things. Lastly he
shows how carefully we ought to avoid the pride of Arius, by putting
before us various examples of Scriptures.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xx-p2"></span>227. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.vii.xx-p2.1"></span>To</span> Thee now, Almighty Father, do I
direct my words with tears. I indeed have readily called Thee
inapproachable, incomprehensible, inestimable; but I dared not say Thy
Son was inferior to Thyself. For when I read that He is the Brightness
of Thy glory, and the Image of Thy Person, <span
id="fr_2813"></span>[2814](#fn_2813.md) I fear lest, in saying that the
Image of Thy Person is inferior, I should seem to say that Thy Person is
inferior, of which the Son is the Image; for the fulness of Thy Godhead
is wholly in the Son. I have often read, I freely believe, that Thou and
Thy Son and the Holy Spirit are boundless, unmeasurable, inestimable,
ineffable. And therefore I cannot appraise Thee so as to weigh Thee.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xx-p4"></span>228. But be it so, that I desired with
a daring and rash spirit to measure Thee? From whence, I ask, shall I
measure Thee? The prophet saw a line of flax with which the angel
measured Jerusalem. An angel was measuring, not Arius. And he was
measuring Jerusalem, not God. And perchance even an angel could not
measure Jerusalem, for it was a man. Thus it is written: “I raised mine
eyes and saw and beheld a man, and in his hand there was a <span
id="page_314">p. 314</span> <span id="iv.iv.vii.xx-Page_314"></span>line
of flax.” <span id="fr_2814"></span>[2815](#fn_2814.md) He was a man, for a
type of the body that was to be assumed was thus shown. He was a man, of
whom it was said: “There cometh a man after me, Whose shoe’s latchet I
am not worthy to unloose.” <span id="fr_2815"></span>[2816](#fn_2815.md)
Therefore Christ in a type measures Jerusalem. Arius measures God.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xx-p7"></span>229. Even Satan transforms himself
into an angel of light; <span id="fr_2816"></span>[2817](#fn_2816.md) what
wonder then if Arius imitates his Author in taking upon himself what is
forbidden? Though his father the devil did it not in his own case, that
man with intolerable blasphemy assumes to himself the knowledge of
divine secrets and the mysteries of the heavenly Generation. For the
devil confessed the true Son of God, Arius denies Him.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xx-p9"></span>230. If, then, I cannot measure Thee,
Almighty Father, can I without blasphemy discuss the secrets of Thy
Generation? Can I say there is anything more or less between Thee and
Thy Son when He Himself Who was begotten of Thee, says: “All things
which the Father hath are Mine.” <span
id="fr_2817"></span>[2818](#fn_2817.md) Who has made Me a judge and a
divider of human affairs? This the Son says, <span
id="fr_2818"></span>[2819](#fn_2818.md) and do we claim to make a division
and to give judgment between the Father and the Son? A right feeling of
duty avoids arbiters even in the division of an inheritance. And shall
we become arbiters, to divide between Thee and Thy Son the glory of the
uncreated Substance?

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xx-p12"></span>231. “This generation,” it says, “is
an evil generation. It seeketh a sign, and there shall no sign be given
it, but the sign of Jonas the prophet.” <span
id="fr_2819"></span>[2820](#fn_2819.md) A sign of the Godhead then is not
given, but only of the Incarnation. Thus when about to speak of the
Incarnation the prophet says: “Ask thee a sign.” And when the king had
said: “I will not ask, neither will I tempt the Lord,” the answer was:
“Behold a Virgin shall conceive.” <span
id="fr_2820"></span>[2821](#fn_2820.md) Therefore we cannot see a sign of
the Godhead, and do we seek a measure of it? Alas! woe is me! we
impiously dare to discuss Him, to Whom we cannot worthily pray!

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xx-p15"></span>232. Let the Arians see to what they
do. I have unlawfully compared Thee, O Father, with Thy works in saying
that Thou art greater than all. If greater than Thy Son, as Arius
maintains, I have judged wickedly. Concerning Thee first will that
judgment be. For no choice can be made except by comparison, nor can
anyone be put before another without a decision being first given on
Himself.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xx-p16"></span>233. It is not lawful for us to swear
by heaven, but it is lawful to judge about God. Yet Thou hast given to
Thy Son alone judgment over all.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xx-p17"></span>234. John feared to baptize the flesh
of the Lord, John forbade Him, saying: “I have need to be baptized of
Thee, and comest Thou to me?” <span id="fr_2821"></span>[2822](#fn_2821.md)
And shall I bring Christ under my judgment?

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xx-p19"></span>235. Moses excuses himself from the
Priesthood, Peter is for avoiding the obedience demanded in the
Ministry; and does Arius examine even the deep things of God? But Arius
is not the Holy Spirit. Nay, it was said even to Arius and to all men:
“Seek not that which is too deep for thee.” <span
id="fr_2822"></span>[2823](#fn_2822.md)

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xx-p21"></span>236. Moses is prevented from seeing
the face of God; <span id="fr_2823"></span>[2824](#fn_2823.md) Arius
merited to see it in secret. Moses and Aaron among His Priests. Moses
who appeared with the Lord in glory, that Moses then saw only the back
parts of God in appearance; Arius beholds God wholly face to face! But
“no one,” it says, “can see My face and live.” <span
id="fr_2824"></span>[2825](#fn_2824.md)

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xx-p24"></span>237. Paul also speaks of inferior
beings: “We know in part and we prophesy in part.” <span
id="fr_2825"></span>[2826](#fn_2825.md) Arius says: “I know God altogether
and not in part.” Thus Paul is inferior to Arius, and the vessel of
election knows in part, but the vessel of perdition knows wholly. “I
know,” he says, “a man, whether in the body or out of the body, I cannot
tell, God knoweth, how he was caught up into Paradise and heard
unspeakable words.” <span id="fr_2826"></span>[2827](#fn_2826.md) Paul
carried up to the third heaven, knew not himself; Arius rolling in
filth, knows God. Paul says of himself: “God knows;” Arius says of God:
“I know.”

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xx-p27"></span>238. But Arius was not caught up to
heaven, although he followed him who with accursed boastfulness presumed
on what was divine, saying: “I will set my throne upon the clouds; I
will be like the Most High.” <span id="fr_2827"></span>[2828](#fn_2827.md)
For as he said: “I will be like the Most High,” so too Arius wishes the
Most High Son of God to seem like himself, Whom he does not worship in
the eternal glory of His Godhead, but measures by the weakness of the
flesh.
