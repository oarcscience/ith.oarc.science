### <span id="iv.viii.i-p0.1"></span>Introduction.

<span id="iv.viii.i-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.viii.i-p1.1"></span>The</span> writer informs us himself at the
beginning of his treatise that he felt moved by the example of St. Paul,
after speaking about virgins, to continue with the subject of widows.
But there was also another matter in his own diocese which touched him
personally, and caused him at once to take up the matter. A certain
widow who had several daughters, some married already and others of
marriageable age, began to think of a second marriage for herself. St.
Ambrose, partly for her own sake, partly that it might not be supposed
that he had in any way advised the step, published the following
treatise.

<span id="iv.viii.i-p2"></span>In the first place he affirms that the
profession of widowhood comes very close to that of virginity, and is to
be esteemed far above the married state. He proves this by the testimony
of St. Paul and by his description of one who is a widow indeed; also by
many examples taken both from the old and New Testament. Having
mentioned St. Peter’s wife’s mother, he turns more particularly to the
widow for whose sake he is writing, though he avoids mentioning her
name, pointing out how really empty and insufficient are all the reasons
she is setting before herself for marrying again. The marriage bond is,
indeed, he says, holy and good, and the married and single are as
various kinds of flowers in the field of the church. There is, however,
more corn produced than lilies, more that is married than virgin. He
points out that widowhood has been held in dishonour by idolaters alone,
for which reason it may well be held in honour by Christians. St.
Ambrose does not condemn a second marriage, though placing widowhood
before it, as being bound to aim at leading those committed to his
loving care to the highest possible degree of perfection.

<span id="iv.viii.i-p3"></span>The treatise was written not long after
that concerning Virgins, that is, soon after <span class="sc"><span

<span id="iv.viii.i-p4"></span> It is interesting to compare with this
treatise the letter of St. Jerome to Furia on the same subject, No. 54,
Vol. VI. of this series.

[Next: Chapter I. After having written about virgins, it seemed needful
to say something concerning widows, since the Apostle joins the two
classes together, and the latter are as it were teachers of the former,
and far superior to those who are married. Elijah was sent to a widow, a
great mark of honour; yet widows are not honourable like her of Sarepta,
unless they copy her virtues, notably hospitality. The avarice of men is
rebuked, who forfeit the promises of God by their grasping.](2100350.md)
