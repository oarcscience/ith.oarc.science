#### <span id="iv.iv.vii.xix-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xix-p1"></span>Wishing to give a reason for the
Lord’s answer to the apostles, he assigns the one received to Christ’s
tenderness. Then when another reason is supplied by others he confesses
that it is true; for the Lord spoke it by reason of His human feelings.
Hence he gathers that the knowledge of the Father and the Son is equal,
and that the Son is not inferior to the Father. After having set beside
the text, in which He is said to be inferior, another whereby He is
declared to be equal, he censures the rashness of the Arians in judging
about the Son, and shows that whilst they wickedly make Him to be
inferior, He is rightly called a Stone by Himself.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xix-p2"></span>219. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.vii.xix-p2.1"></span>We</span> have been taught therefore that
the Son of God is not ignorant of the future. If they confess this, I
too—that I may now answer why He declared that neither angels, nor the
Son, but only the Father knows—call to mind His wonted love for His
disciples also in this passage, and His grace, which by its very
frequency ought to have been known to all. For the Lord, filled with
deep love for His disciples, when they asked from Him what He thought
unprofitable for them to know, prefers to seem ignorant of what He
knows, rather than to refuse an answer. He loves rather to provide what
is useful for us, than to show His own power.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xix-p3"></span>220. There are, however, some not so
faint-hearted as I. For I would rather fear the deep things of God, than
be wise. There are some, however, relying on the words: “And Jesus
increased in age and in wisdom and in favour with God and man,” <span
id="fr_2801"></span>[2802](#fn_2801.md) who boldly say, that according to
His Godhead indeed He could not be ignorant of the future, but that in
His assumption of our human state He said that He as Son of Man was in
ignorance before His crucifixion. For when He speaks of the Son, He does
not speak as it were of another; for He Himself is our Lord the Son of
God and the Son of a Virgin. But by a word which embraces both, He
guides our mind, so that He as Son of Man according to His adoption of
our ignorance and growth of knowledge, might be believed as yet not
fully to have known all things. For it is not for us to know the future.
Thus He seems to be ignorant in that state in which He makes progress.
For how does He progress according to His Godhead, in Whom the fulness
of the Godhead dwells? <span id="fr_2802"></span>[2803](#fn_2802.md) Or
what is there which the Son of God does not know, Who said: “Why think
ye evil in your hearts?” <span id="fr_2803"></span>[2804](#fn_2803.md) How
does He not know, of Whom Scripture says: “But Jesus knew their
thoughts”? <span id="fr_2804"></span>[2805](#fn_2804.md)

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xix-p8"></span>221. This is what others say, but
I—to return to my former point, where I stated it was written of the
Father: “It may be they will reverence My Son,”—I think indeed this was
written in order that the Father, as He was speaking of men, might also
seem to have spoken with human feelings. But still more am I inclined to
think that the Son Who went about with men, and lived the life of man,
and took upon Him our flesh, assumed also our feelings; so that after
our ignorance He might say He knew not, though there was not anything He
did not know. For though He seemed to be a man in the reality of His
body, yet was He Life, and Light, and virtue came out of Him, <span
id="fr_2805"></span>[2806](#fn_2805.md) to heal the <span id="page_313">p.
313</span> <span id="iv.iv.vii.xix-Page_313"></span>wounds of the
injured by the power of His Majesty.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xix-p10"></span>222. Ye see then that this matter
has been solved for you, since the saying of the Son is referred to the
assumption of our state in its fulness, and it was thus written
concerning the Father, in order that you might cease to cavil at the
Son.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xix-p11"></span>223. There was nothing then of which
the Son of God was ignorant, for there was nothing of which the Father
was ignorant. But if the Son was ignorant of nothing, as we now
conclude, let them say in what respect they wish Him to seem to be
inferior. If God has begotten a Son inferior to Himself, He has granted
Him less. If He has granted Him less, He either wished to give less, or
could only give less. But the Father is neither weak nor envious, seeing
that there was neither will nor power before the Son. For wherein is He
inferior, Who has all things even as the Father has them? He has
received all things from the Father by right of His Generation, <span
id="fr_2806"></span>[2807](#fn_2806.md) and has shown forth the Father
wholly by the glory of His Majesty.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xix-p13"></span>224. It is written, they say: “For
the Father is greater than I.” <span
id="fr_2807"></span>[2808](#fn_2807.md) It is also written: “He thought it
not robbery to be equal with God.” <span
id="fr_2808"></span>[2809](#fn_2808.md) It is written again that the Jews
wished to kill Him, because He said He was the Son of God, making
Himself equal with God. <span id="fr_2809"></span>[2810](#fn_2809.md) It is
written: “I and My Father are one.” <span
id="fr_2810"></span>[2811](#fn_2810.md) They read “one,” they do not read
“many.” Can He then be both inferior and equal in the same Nature? Nay,
the one refers to His Godhead, the other to His flesh.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xix-p18"></span>225. They say He is inferior: I ask
who has measured it, who is of so overweening a heart, as to place the
Father and the Son before his judgment seat to decide upon which is the
greater? “My heart is not haughty nor are mine eyes raised unto
vanity,” <span id="fr_2811"></span>[2812](#fn_2811.md) says David. King
David feared to raise his heart in pride in human affairs, but we raise
ours even in opposition to the divine secrets. Who shall decide about
the Son of God? Thrones, dominions, angels, powers? But archangels give
attendance and serve Him, cherubim and seraphim minister to Him and
praise Him. Who then decides about the Son of God, on reading that the
Father Himself knows the Son, but will not judge Him. “For no man
knoweth the Son, but the Father.” <span
id="fr_2812"></span>[2813](#fn_2812.md) “Knoweth” it says, not “judgeth.”
It is one thing to know, another to judge. The Father has knowledge in
Himself. The Son has no power superior to Himself. And again: “No man
knoweth the Father, but the Son;” and He Himself knows the Father, as
the Father knows Him.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xix-p21"></span>226. But thou sayest that He said He
was inferior, He said also He was a Stone. Thou sayest more and yet dost
impiously attack Him. I say less and with reverence add to His honour.
Thou sayest He is inferior and confessest Him to be above the angels. I
say He is less than the angels, yet do not take from His honour; for I
do not refute His Godhead, but I do proclaim His pity

[Next: Chapter XIX. The Saint having turned to God the Father, explains
why he does not deride that the Son is inferior to the Father, then he
declares it is not for him to measure the Son of God, since it was given
to an angel--nay, perhaps even to Christ as man--to measure merely
Jerusalem. Arius, he says, has shown himself to be an imitator of Satan.
It is a rash thing to hold discussions on the divine Generation. Since
so great a sign of human generation has been given by Isaiah, we ought
not to make comparisons in divine things. Lastly he shows how carefully
we ought to avoid the pride of Arius, by putting before us various
examples of Scriptures.](2100273.md)
