[Next: Chapter I. Not only were the prophets and apostles sent by the
Spirit, but also the Son of God. This is proved from Isaiah and the
evangelists, and it is explained why St. Luke wrote that the same Spirit
descended like a dove upon Christ and abode upon Him. Next, after
establishing this mission of Christ, the writer infers that the Son is
sent by the Father and the Spirit, as the Spirit is by the Father and
the Son.](2100153.md)
