<span id="iv.ii.iv.iv"></span>

#### <span id="iv.ii.iv.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.iv-p1"></span>To those who contend that the Spirit
because He is called the Finger is less than the Father, St. Ambrose
replies that this would also tend to the lessening of the Son, Who is
called the Right Hand. That these names are to be referred only to the
Unity, for which reason Moses proclaimed that the whole Trinity worked
in the passage of the Red Sea. And, indeed, it is no wonder that the
operation of the Spirit found place there, where there was a figure of
baptism, since the Scripture teaches that the Three Persons equally
sanctify and are operative in that sacrament.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.iv-p2"></span>17. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.ii.iv.iv-p2.1"></span>But</span> if any one is still entangled in
carnal doubts, and hesitates because of bodily figures, let him consider
that he cannot think rightly of the Son who can think wrongly of the
Spirit. For if some think that the Spirit is a certain small portion of
God, because He is called the Finger of God, the same persons must
certainly maintain that a small portion only is in the Son of God,
because He is called the Right Hand of God.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.iv-p3"></span>18. But the Son is called both the
Right Hand and the Power of God; if, then, we consider our words, there
can be no perfection without power; let them therefore take care lest
they think that which it is impious to say, namely, that the Father
being but half perfect in His own Substance received perfection through
the Son, and let them cease to deny that the Son is co-eternal with the
Father. For when did the Power of God not exist? But if they think that
at any time the Power of God existed not, they will say that at some
time Perfection existed not in God the Father, to Whom they think that
Power was at some time wanting.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.iv-p4"></span>19. But, as I said, these things are
written that we may refer them to the Unity of the Godhead, and believe
that which the Apostle said, that the fulness of the Godhead dwells
bodily in Christ, <span id="fr_1257"></span>[1258](#fn_1257.md) which
dwells also in the Father, and dwells in the Holy Spirit; and that, as
there is a unity of the Godhead, so also is there a unity of operation.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.iv-p6"></span>20. And this may also be gathered from
the Song of Moses, for he, after leading the people of the Jews through
the sea, acknowledged the operation of the Father, the Son, and the Holy
Spirit, saying: “Thy Right Hand, O Lord, is glorious in power, Thy Right
Hand, O Lord, hath dashed in pieces the enemy.” <span
id="fr_1258"></span>[1259](#fn_1258.md) Here you have his confession of the
Son and of the Father, Whose Right Hand He is. And farther on, not to
pass by the Holy Spirit, He added: “Thou didst send Thy Spirit and the
sea covered them, and the water was divided by the Spirit of Thine
anger.” <span id="fr_1259"></span>[1260](#fn_1259.md) By which is signified
the unity of the Godhead, not an inequality of the Trinity.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.iv-p9"></span>21. You see, then, that the Holy Spirit
also co-operated with the Father and the Son, so that just as if the
waves were congealed in the midst of the sea, a wall as it were of water
rose up for the passage of the Jews, and then, poured back again by the
Spirit, overwhelmed the people of the Egyptians. And many think that
from the same origin the pillar of cloud went before the people of the
Jews by day, and the pillar of fire by <span id="page_139">p. 139</span>
<span id="iv.ii.iv.iv-Page_139"></span>night, that the grace of the
Spirit might protect His people.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.iv-p10"></span>22. Now that this operation of God,
which the whole world rightly wonders at, did not take place without the
work of the Holy Spirit, the Apostle also declared when he said that the
truth of a spiritual mystery was prefigured in it, for we read as
follows: “For our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed
through the sea, and were all baptized in Moses in the cloud and in the
sea, and did all eat the same spiritual meat, and did all drink the same
spiritual drink.” <span id="fr_1260"></span>[1261](#fn_1260.md)

<span id="iv.ii.iv.iv-p12"></span>23. For how without the operation of
the Holy Spirit could there be the type of a sacrament, the whole truth
of which is in the Spirit? As the Apostle also set forth, saying: “But
ye were washed, but ye were sanctified, but ye were justified in the
Name of our Lord Jesus Christ, and in the Spirit of our God.” <span
id="fr_1261"></span>[1262](#fn_1261.md)

<span id="iv.ii.iv.iv-p14"></span>24. You see, then, that the Father
works in the Son, and that the Son works in the Spirit. And therefore do
not doubt that, according to the order of Scripture, there was in the
figure that which the Truth Himself declared to be in the truth. For who
can deny His operation in the Font, in which we feel His operation and
grace?

<span id="iv.ii.iv.iv-p15"></span>25. For as the Father sanctifies, so,
too, the Son sanctifies, and the Holy Spirit sanctifies. The Father
sanctifies according to that which is written: “The God of peace
sanctify you, and may your spirit, soul, and body be preserved entire
without blame in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.” <span
id="fr_1262"></span>[1263](#fn_1262.md) And elsewhere the Son says:
“Father, sanctify them in the truth.” <span
id="fr_1263"></span>[1264](#fn_1263.md)

<span id="iv.ii.iv.iv-p18"></span>26. But of the Son the same Apostle
said: “Who was made unto us wisdom from God, and righteousness, and
sanctification, and redemption.” <span
id="fr_1264"></span>[1265](#fn_1264.md) Do you see that He was made
sanctification? But He was made so unto us, not that He should change
that which He was, but that He might sanctify us in the flesh.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.iv-p20"></span>27. And the Apostle also teaches that
the Holy Spirit sanctifies. For he speaks thus: “We are bound to give
thanks to God always for you, brethren dearly beloved of the Lord;
because God chose you as first-fruits unto salvation, in sanctification
of the Spirit, and belief of the truth.” <span
id="fr_1265"></span>[1266](#fn_1265.md)

<span id="iv.ii.iv.iv-p22"></span>28. So, then, the Father sanctifies,
the Son also sanctifies, and the Holy Spirit sanctifies; but the
sanctification is one, for baptism is one, and the grace of the
sacrament is one.

[Next: Chapter V. The writer sums up the argument he had commenced, and
confirms the statement that unity is signified by the terms finger and
right hand, from the fact that the works of God are the same as are the
works of hands; and that those of hands are the same as those of
fingers; and lastly, that the term hand applies equally to the Son and
the Spirit, and that of finger applies to the Spirit and the
Son.](2100157.md)
