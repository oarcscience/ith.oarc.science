#### <span id="iv.i.iii.xxvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXVI.

<span id="iv.i.iii.xxvi-p1"></span>How long standing an evil love of
money is, is plain from many examples in the Old Testament. And yet it
is plain, too, how idle a thing the possession of money is.

<span id="iv.i.iii.xxvi-p2"></span>129. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.iii.xxvi-p2.1"></span>But</span> man’s habits have so long
applied themselves to this admiration of money, that no one is thought
worthy of honour unless he is rich. <span
id="fr_553"></span>[554](#fn_553) This is no new habit. Nay, this vice
(and that makes the matter worse) grew long years ago in the hearts of
men. When the city of Jericho fell at the sound of the priests’
trumpets, and Joshua the son of Nun gained the victory, he knew that the
valour of the people was weakened through love of money and desire for
gold. For when Achan had taken a garment of gold and two hundred shekels
of silver and a golden ingot <span id="fr_554"></span>[555](#fn_554)
from the spoils of the ruined city, he was brought before the Lord, and
could not deny the theft, but owned it. <span
id="fr_555"></span>[556](#fn_555)

<span id="iv.i.iii.xxvi-p6"></span>130. Love of money, then, is an old,
an ancient vice, which showed itself even at the declaration of the
divine law; for a law was given to check it. <span
id="fr_556"></span>[557](#fn_556) On account of love of money Balak
thought Balaam could be tempted by rewards to curse the people of our
fathers. <span id="fr_557"></span>[558](#fn_557) Love of money would
have won the day too, had not God bidden him hold back from cursing.
Overcome by love of money Achan led to destruction all the people of the
fathers. So Joshua the son of Nun, who could stay the sun from setting,
could not stay the love of money in man from creeping on. At the sound
of his voice the sun stood still, but love of money stayed not. When the
sun stood still Joshua completed his triumph, but when love of money
went on, he almost lost the victory.

<span id="iv.i.iii.xxvi-p9"></span>131. Why? Did not the woman Delilah’s
love of money deceive Samson, the bravest man of all? <span
id="fr_558"></span>[559](#fn_558) So he who had torn asunder the roaring
lion with his hands; <span id="fr_559"></span>[560](#fn_559) who, when
bound and handed over to his enemies, alone, without help, burst his
bonds and slew a thousand of them; <span
id="fr_560"></span>[561](#fn_560) who broke the cords interwoven with
sinews as though they were but the slight threads of a net; he, I say,
having laid his head on the woman’s knee, was robbed of the decoration
of his victory-bringing hair, that which gave him his might. Money
flowed into the lap of the woman, and the favour of God forsook the
man. <span id="fr_561"></span>[562](#fn_561)

<span id="iv.i.iii.xxvi-p14"></span>132. Love of money, then, is deadly.
Seductive is money, whilst it also defiles those who have it, and helps
not those who have it not. Supposing that money sometimes is a help, yet
it is only a help to a poor man who makes his want known. What good is
it to him who does not long for it, nor seek it; who does not need its
help and is not turned aside by pursuit of it? What good is it to
others, if he who has it is alone the richer for it? Is he therefore
more honourable because he has that whereby honour is often lost,
because he has what he must guard rather than possess? We possess what
we use, but what is beyond our use brings us no fruit of possession, but
only the danger of watching.

[Next: Chapter XXVII. In contempt of money there is the pattern of
justice, which virtue bishops and clerics ought to aim at together with
some others. A few words are added on the duty of not bringing an
excommunication too quickly into force.](2100090)
