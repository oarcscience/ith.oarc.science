#### <span id="iv.iv.vi.x-p0.1"></span>Chapter X.

<span id="iv.iv.vi.x-p1"></span>*The objection that Christ, on the
showing of St. John, lives because of the Father, and therefore is not
to be regarded as equal with the Father, is met by the reply that for
the Life of the Son, in respect of His Godhead, there has never been a
time when it began; and that it is dependent upon none, whilst the
passage in question must be understood as referring to His human life,
as is shown by His speaking there of His body and blood. Two expositions
of the passage are given, the one of which is shown to refer to Christ’s
Manhood, whilst the second teaches His equality with the Father, as also
His likeness with men. Rebuke is administered to the Arians for the
insult which they are seeking to inflict upon the Son, and the sense in
which the Son can be said to live “because of” the Father is explained,
as also the* <span id="page_278">p. 278</span> <span
id="iv.iv.vi.x-Page_278"></span>*union of life with the divine Life. A
further objection, based upon the Son’s prayer that He may be glorified
by the Father, is briefly refuted.*

<span id="iv.iv.vi.x-p2"></span>118. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.vi.x-p2.1"></span>There</span> are not a few who raise this
further objection, that it is written: “As the living Father hath sent
Me, and I live by the Father; so he that eateth Me, liveth also by
Me.” <span id="fr_2437"></span>[2438](#fn_2437.md) “How,” ask they, “is the
Son equal with the Father, when He has said that He lives by the
Father?”

<span id="iv.iv.vi.x-p4"></span>119. Let those who oppose us on this
ground tell us first what the Life of the Son is. Is it a life bestowed
by the Father upon one lacking life? But how could the Son ever fail to
possess life, He Himself being the Life, as He says, “I am the Way, the
Truth, and the Life.” <span id="fr_2438"></span>[2439](#fn_2438.md) Truly,
His life is eternal, even as His power is eternal. Was there a time,
then, when (so to speak) Life possessed not itself?

<span id="iv.iv.vi.x-p6"></span>120. Bethink you what is read this day
concerning the Lord Jesus, that “He died for our sakes, to the end that
whether we wake or whether we sleep, we may live with Him.” <span
id="fr_2439"></span>[2440](#fn_2439.md) He Whose Death is Life, is not His
Godhead Life, seeing that the Godhead is Life eternal?

<span id="iv.iv.vi.x-p8"></span>121. But is His Life truly in the
Father’s power? Why, He showed that even His bodily life was not in the
power of any other, as we have it on record: “I lay down My life, that I
may take it again. No man taketh it from Me, but I lay it down of
Myself. I have power to lay it down, and again I have power to take it.
This commandment have I received of My Father.” <span
id="fr_2440"></span>[2441](#fn_2440.md)

<span id="iv.iv.vi.x-p10"></span>122. Is His divine Life then to be
regarded as depending upon the power of another, when His bodily life
was subject to no other power but His own? For it would have been the
power of another, but for the Unity of power. But just as He gives us to
understand that His laying down His life was done of His own power, and
of His free Will, so also He teaches us, in laying it down in obedience
to His Father’s command, the unity of His own with the Father’s Will.

<span id="iv.iv.vi.x-p11"></span>123. If, then, there has neither been a
time when the Life of the Son took a commencement, nor any power to
which it has been subjected, let us consider what His meaning was when
He said: “Even as the living Father hath sent Me, and I live by the
Father”? Let us expound His meaning as best we can; nay, rather let Him
expound it Himself.

<span id="iv.iv.vi.x-p12"></span>124. Take notice, then, what He said in
an earlier part of His discourse. “Verily, verily, I say unto you.” He
first teaches thee how thou oughtest to listen. “Verily, verily, I say
unto you, unless ye eat the flesh of the Son of Man, and drink His
blood, ye shall have no life in you.” <span
id="fr_2441"></span>[2442](#fn_2441.md) He first premised that He was
speaking as Son of Man; dost thou then think that what He hath said, as
Son of Man, concerning His Flesh and His Blood, is to be applied to His
Godhead?

<span id="iv.iv.vi.x-p14"></span>125. Then He added: “For My Flesh is
meat indeed, and My Blood is drink \[indeed\].” <span
id="fr_2442"></span>[2443](#fn_2442.md) Thou hearest Him speak of His Flesh
and of His Blood, thou perceivest the sacred pledges, \[conveying to us
the merits and power\] of the Lord’s death, <span
id="fr_2443"></span>[2444](#fn_2443.md) and thou dishonourest His Godhead.
Hear His own words: “A spirit hath not flesh and bones.” <span
id="fr_2444"></span>[2445](#fn_2444.md) Now we, as often as we receive the
Sacramental Elements, which by the mysterious efficacy of holy prayer
are transformed into the Flesh and the Blood, “do show the Lord’s
Death.” <span id="fr_2445"></span>[2446](#fn_2445.md)

<span id="iv.iv.vi.x-p19"></span>126. Then, after calling on us to take
notice that He speaks as Son of Man, and frequent repeated mention of
His Flesh and His Blood, He adds: “Even as the living Father hath sent
Me, and I live by the Father, so he that eateth Me, he also liveth by
Me.” How then do they suppose that we are to understand these words?—for
the comparison can be shown as a double one. The first comparison being
after the following manner: “Even as the living Father hath sent Me, I
live by the Father;” the second: “Even as the living Father hath sent
Me, and I live by the Father, so also he that eateth Me, he too liveth
by Me.”

<span id="iv.iv.vi.x-p20"></span>127. If our adversaries choose the
former, the meaning is this, that, “as I am sent by the Father and am
come down from the Father, so (in accordance therewith) I live by the
Father.” But in what character was He sent, and came down, save as Son
of Man, even as He Himself said before: “No man hath ascended into
heaven, save He that hath come down from heaven as Son of Man.” <span
id="fr_2446"></span>[2447](#fn_2446.md) Then, just as He was sent and came
down as Son of Man, so as Son of Man He lives by the Father.
Furthermore, he that eateth Him, as eating the Son of Man, doth himself
also live by the Son of Man. Thus, He has compared the effect of His
Incarnation to His coming.

<span id="iv.iv.vi.x-p22"></span><span id="page_279">p. 279</span> <span
id="iv.iv.vi.x-Page_279"></span>128. But if they choose the second
method, do we not infer both the equality of the Son with the Father,
and His likeness to men, together, though in clear mutual distinction?
For what is the meaning of the words, “Even as He Himself liveth by the
Father, so we also live by Him,” but that the Son so quickeneth a man,
as the Father hath in the Son quickened human nature? <span
id="fr_2447"></span>[2448](#fn_2447.md) “For as the Father raiseth the dead
and quickeneth them, so also the Son quickeneth whom He will,” <span
id="fr_2448"></span>[2449](#fn_2448.md) as the Lord Himself hath already
said.

<span id="iv.iv.vi.x-p25"></span>129. Thus the equality of the Son to
the Father is established simply upon unity in the action of quickening,
since the Son so quickeneth as the Father doth. Acknowledge therefore
the eternity of His Life and Sovereignty. Again, our likeness with the
Son is discovered, and a certain unity with Him in the flesh, <span
id="fr_2449"></span>[2450](#fn_2449.md) because that, like as the Son of
God was quickened in the flesh <span
id="fr_2450"></span>[2451](#fn_2450.md) by the Father, so also is man
quickened; for thus it is written, that as God raised Jesus Christ from
the dead, so we also, as men, are quickened by the Son of God. <span
id="fr_2451"></span>[2452](#fn_2451.md)

<span id="iv.iv.vi.x-p29"></span>130. According to this interpretation,
then, immortality is not only applied to our condition by grace of
bounty, but is also proclaimed as the property of Godhead—the latter,
because it is the Godhead which quickeneth; the former, because manhood
is quickened in Christ.

<span id="iv.iv.vi.x-p30"></span>131. But if any would apply the force
of either comparison to Christ’s *Godhead*, then the Son of God is put
on one footing with men, so that the Son of God lives by the Father just
as we live by the Son of God. But the Son of God bestows eternal life by
free gift, we cannot so do. If then He be placed on a level with us, He
too does not bestow this gift. Let Arius’ disciples then have the due
reward of their faith—which is, not to obtain eternal life of the Son.

<span id="iv.iv.vi.x-p31"></span>132. I would now go further. If our
opponents are pleased to apply the teaching of this passage to the
principle of the eternity of the Divine Substance, let them hear a third
exposition: Does not our Lord plainly appear to say that as the Father
is a living Father, so too the Son also lives?—and who can but observe
that here we must understand a reference to unity of Life, forasmuch as
the same Life is the Life of the Father and the Life of the Son? “For as
the Father hath Life in Himself, so hath He given to the Son also to
have Life in Himself.” <span id="fr_2452"></span>[2453](#fn_2452.md) He
hath given—by reason of unity with Him. He hath given, not to take away,
but that He may be glorified in the Son. He hath given, not that He, the
Father, might keep guard over it, but that the Son might have it in
possession.

<span id="iv.iv.vi.x-p33"></span>133. But the Arians think that they
must oppose hereto the fact that He had said, “I live by the Father.” Of
a certainty (suppose that they conceive the words as referring to His
Godhead) the Son lives by the Father, because He is the Son begotten of
the Father,—by the Father, because He is of one Substance with the
Father,—by the Father, because He is the Word given forth from the heart
of the Father, <span id="fr_2453"></span>[2454](#fn_2453.md) because He
came forth from the Father, because He is begotten of the “bowels of the
Father,” <span id="fr_2454"></span>[2455](#fn_2454.md) because the Father
is the Fountain and Root of the Son’s being.

<span id="iv.iv.vi.x-p36"></span>134. But peradventure they may urge:
“If you hold that the Son, in saying, ‘And I live by the Father,’ spoke
of the unity of life subsisting between the Father and the Son, does it
not follow that He discovered the unity of life between the Son and
mankind in saying that ‘he that eateth Me, the same liveth by Me’?”

<span id="iv.iv.vi.x-p37"></span>135. Even so. Just as I confess the
unity of celestial Life subsisting in Father and Son by reason of the
unity of the substance of the Godhead, so too, save as concerns the
prerogatives of the Divine Nature or those which are the effect of the
Incarnation of our Lord, I affirm of the Son a participation of
spiritual life with us by virtue of the unity of His Manhood with ours,
for “as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.” <span
id="fr_2455"></span>[2456](#fn_2455.md) Further, even as in Him we sit at
the right hand of the Father, not in the sense that we share His throne,
but that we rest in the Body of Christ—even as, I say, we have part in
Christ’s session by reason of corporal unity, so too we live <span
id="page_280">p. 280</span> <span id="iv.iv.vi.x-Page_280"></span>in
Christ by reason of unity of our bodies with His Body.

<span id="iv.iv.vi.x-p39"></span>136. Not only, then, have I no fears of
the text, “I live by the Father,” but I should have none, even though
Christ had said, “I live by help of the Father.” <span
id="fr_2456"></span>[2457](#fn_2456.md)

<span id="iv.iv.vi.x-p41"></span>137. Now another objection commonly
urged by them starts from the text: “This sickness is not unto death,
but for the glory of God, to the end that His Son may be glorified by
Him.” <span id="fr_2457"></span>[2458](#fn_2457.md) But not only is the Son
glorified through the Father and by the Father, as it is written:
“Glorify Me, Father;” <span id="fr_2458"></span>[2459](#fn_2458.md) and
again: “Now hath the Son of Man been glorified, and God hath been
glorified in Him, and God glorifieth Him,” <span
id="fr_2459"></span>[2460](#fn_2459.md) but the Father also is glorified
through the Son and by the Son, for Truth hath said: “I have glorified
Thee upon earth.” <span id="fr_2460"></span>[2461](#fn_2460.md)

<span id="iv.iv.vi.x-p46"></span>138. Even as the Son, therefore, is
glorified through the Father, so too He lives by the Father. There are
some who have been led by consideration of these words to the
supposition that \[the Greek\] “<span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iv.vi.x-p46.1"></span>δόξα</span>” means “opinion, belief,”
rather than “glory,” and therefore have interpreted as follows: “I have
given thee a <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iv.vi.x-p46.2"></span>δόξα</span> upon earth, I have finished the
work which Thou gavest Me to do, and now, O Father, give me a <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.iv.vi.x-p46.3"></span>δόξα</span>;” that is
to say: “I have taught men so to believe concerning Thee, as to know
that Thou art the true God; do Thou also establish in them, concerning
Me, the belief that I am Thy Son, and very God.”

On this place H. observes: “As the Son, by reason of a nature
numerically identical with the Father’s, lives together with Him the
same Divine Life, so we by virtue of a manhood specifically the same as
Christ’s have power to live the life which the Man Christ lives; which
life indeed resides in its greatest fulness in Him as its Head and
Fountain, and from His Person overflows into us, His members—yet not
without a certain difference, for the comparison is incomplete, by
reason, namely, of the reservation of prerogatives attaching to the
Divine Nature or to the Lord’s Incarnation. The Godhead is numerically
One, the Life of the Father and the Life of the Son is numerically one,
but Christ’s Life and ours are not so. Moreover, this (Divine) Life
subsistent in the Son is united to His Manhood in and by the unity of
His Person, but is not communicated to us in so close an alliance,
overflowing rather into us only by a certain participation.…But perhaps
the sainted Doctor’s meaning here is that we live and abide in Christ by
a corporal unity, because, Christ having Manhood specifically the same
as ours, whatsoever is fittingly predicted of manhood as existing in
Christ is applicable to all His fellow-men. The first construction,
however, explains St. Ambrose’s analogy more fully.”

<span id="iv.iv.vi.x-p40"></span> St. Ambrose quotes the words from St.
[John vi. 58](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#058.md)<span
id="iv.iv.vi.x-p40.1"></span>, thus: “*propter Patrem.*” This seeming
expression of dependence, he says, does not in the least disturb his
belief in the co-eternity and co-equality of the Son with the Father;
which belief would indeed remain unshaken even though Christ’s words had
been still more expressive, to all appearance, of dependence and
inferiority.

[Next: Chapter XI. The particular distinction which the Arians
endeavoured to prove upon the Apostle's teaching that all things are
“of” the Father and “through” the Son, is overthrown, it being shown
that in the passage cited the same Omnipotence is ascribed both to
Father and to Son, as is proved from various texts, especially from the
words of St. Paul himself, in which heretics foolishly find a reference
to the Father only, though indeed there is no diminution or inferiority
of the Son's sovereignty proved, even by such a reference. Finally, the
three phrases, “of Whom,” “through Whom,” “in Whom,” are shown to
