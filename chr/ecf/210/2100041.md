#### <span id="iv.i.ii.xxix-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXIX.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxix-p1"></span>Justice should be observed even in war
and with enemies. This is proved by the example of Moses and Elisha. The
ancient writers learnt in turn from the Hebrews to call their enemies by
a gentler term. Lastly, the foundation of justice rests on faith, and
its symmetry is perfect in the Church.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxix-p2"></span>139. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.ii.xxix-p2.1"></span>How</span> great a thing justice is can be
<span id="page_24">p. 24</span> <span
id="iv.i.ii.xxix-Page_24"></span>gathered from the fact that there is no
place, nor person, nor time, with which it has nothing to do. It must
even be preserved in all dealings with enemies. <span
id="fr_200"></span>[201](#fn_200) For instance, if the day or the spot
for a battle has been agreed upon with them, it would be considered an
act against justice to occupy the spot beforehand, or to anticipate the
time. For there is some difference whether one is overcome in some
battle by a severe engagement, or by superior skill, or by a mere
chance. But a deeper vengeance is taken on fiercer foes, and on those
that are false as well as on those who have done greater wrongs, as was
the case with the Midianites. <span id="fr_201"></span>[202](#fn_201)
For they had made many of the Jewish people to sin through their women;
for which reason the anger of the Lord was poured out upon the people of
our fathers. Thus it came about that Moses when victorious allowed none
of them to live. On the other hand, Joshua did not attack the
Gibeonites, who had tried the people of our fathers with guile rather
than with war, but punished them by laying on them a law of
bondage. <span id="fr_202"></span>[203](#fn_202) Elisha again would not
allow the king of Israel to slay the Syrians when he wished to do so. He
had brought them into the city, when they were besieging him, after he
had struck them with instantaneous blindness, so that they could not see
where they were going. For he said: “Thou shalt not smite those whom
thou hast not taken captive with thy spear and with thy sword. Set
before them bread and water, that they may eat and drink and return and
go to their own home.” <span id="fr_203"></span>[204](#fn_203) Incited
by their kind treatment they should show forth to the world the kindness
they had received. “Thus” (we read) “there came no more the bands of
Syria into the land of Israel.” <span id="fr_204"></span>[205](#fn_204)

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxix-p8"></span>140. If, then, justice is binding,
even in war, how much more ought we to observe it in time of peace. Such
favour the prophet showed to those who came to seize him. We read that
the king of Syria had sent his army to lie in wait for him, for he had
learnt that it was Elisha who had made known to all his plans and
consultations. And Gehazi the prophet’s servant, seeing the army, began
to fear that his life was in danger. But the prophet said to him: “Fear
not, for they that be with us are more than they that be with
them.” <span id="fr_205"></span>[206](#fn_205) And when the prophet
asked that the eyes of his servant might be opened, they were opened.
Then Gehazi saw the whole mountain full of horses and chariots round
about Elisha. As they came down to him the prophet says: “Smite, O God,
the army of Syria with blindness.” And this prayer being granted, he
says to the Syrians: “Follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom ye
seek.” Then saw they Elisha, whom they were endeavouring to lay hold of,
and seeing him they could not hold him fast. <span
id="fr_206"></span>[207](#fn_206) It is clear from this that faith and
justice should be observed even in war; and that it could not but be a
disgraceful thing if faith were violated.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxix-p11"></span>141. So also the ancients used to
give their foes a less harsh name, and called them strangers. <span
id="fr_207"></span>[208](#fn_207) For enemies used to be called
strangers after the customs of old. This too we can say they adopted
from our writings; for the Hebrews used to call their foes
“allophyllos,” that is, when put into Latin, “alienigenas” (of another
race). For so we read in the first book of Kings: “It came to pass in
those days that they of another race put themselves in array against
Israel.” <span id="fr_208"></span>[209](#fn_208)

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxix-p14"></span>142. The foundation of justice
therefore is faith, <span id="fr_209"></span>[210](#fn_209) for the
hearts of the just dwell on faith, and the just man that accuses himself
builds justice on faith, for his justice becomes plain when he confesses
the truth. So the Lord saith through Isaiah: “Behold, I lay a stone for
a foundation in Sion.” <span id="fr_210"></span>[211](#fn_210) This
means Christ as the foundation of the Church. For Christ is the object
of faith to all; but the Church is as it were the outward form of
justice, she is the common right of all. For all in common she prays,
for all in common she works, in the temptations of all she is tried. So
he who denies himself is indeed a just man, is indeed worthy of Christ.
For this reason Paul has made Christ to be the foundation, so that we
may build upon Him the works of justice, <span
id="fr_211"></span>[212](#fn_211) whilst faith is the foundation. In our
works, then, if they are evil, there appears unrighteousness; if they
are good, justice.
