#### <span id="iv.i.iii.xii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XII.

<span id="iv.i.iii.xii-p1"></span>No one asks counsel from a man tainted
with vice, or from one who is morose or impracticable, but rather from
one of whom we have a pattern in the Scriptures.

<span id="iv.i.iii.xii-p2"></span>60. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.iii.xii-p2.1"></span>We</span> note therefore that in seeking
for counsel, uprightness of life, excellence in virtues, habits of
benevolence, and the charm of good-nature have very great weight. Who
seeks for a spring in the mud? Who wants to drink from muddy water? So
<span id="page_53">p. 53</span> <span
id="iv.i.iii.xii-Page_53"></span>where there is luxurious living,
excess, and a union of vices, who will think that he ought to draw from
that source? Who does not despise a foul life? Who will think a man to
be useful to another’s cause whom he sees to be useless in his own life?
Who, again, does not avoid a wicked, ill-disposed, abusive person, who
is always ready to do harm? Who would not be only too eager to avoid
him? <span id="fr_471"></span>[472](#fn_471.md)

<span id="iv.i.iii.xii-p4"></span>61. And who will come to a man however
well fitted to give the best of advice who is nevertheless hard to
approach? It goes with him as with a fountain whose waters are shut off.
What is the advantage of having wisdom, if one refuses to give advice?
If one cuts off the opportunities of giving advice, the source is
closed, so as no longer to flow for others or to be of any good to
oneself.

<span id="iv.i.iii.xii-p5"></span>62. Well can we refer this to him who,
possessing prudence, has defiled it with the foulness of a vicious life
and so pollutes the water at the source. His life is a proof of a
degenerate spirit. <span id="fr_472"></span>[473](#fn_472.md) How can one
judge him to be good in counsel whom one sees to be evil in character?
He ought to be superior to me, if I am ready to trust myself to him. Am
I to suppose that he is fit to give me advice who never takes it for
himself, or am I to believe that he has time to give to me when he has
none for himself, when his mind is filled with pleasures, and he is
overcome by lust, is the slave of avarice, is excited by greed, and is
terrified with fright? How is there room for counsel here where there is
none for quiet?

<span id="iv.i.iii.xii-p7"></span>63. That man of counsel whom I must
admire and look up to, whom the gracious Lord gave to our fathers, put
aside all that was offensive. His follower he ought to be, who can give
counsel and protect another’s prudence from vice; for nothing foul can
mingle with that.

testimony. From this he goes on to prove its connection with the other
virtues.](2100076.md)
