#### <span id="iv.i.ii.vii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VII.

<span id="iv.i.ii.vii-p1"></span>*How admirably* [Psa.
38](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#000.md)<span
id="iv.i.ii.vii-p1.1"></span>*[Ps.
xxxix.](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#000.md)<span
id="iv.i.ii.vii-p1.2"></span> \[xxxviii.\]* *takes the place of an
introduction. Incited thereto by this psalm the saint determines to
write on duties. He does this with more reason even than Cicero, who
wrote on this subject to his son. How, further, this is so.*

<span id="iv.i.ii.vii-p2"></span>23. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.ii.vii-p2.1"></span>Not</span> without thought did I make use
of the beginning of this psalm, in writing to you, my children. For this
psalm which the Prophet David gave to Jeduthun to sing, <span
id="fr_56"></span>[57](#fn_56.md) I urge you to regard, being delighted
myself with its depth of meaning and the excellency of its maxims. For
we have learnt in those words we have just shortly touched upon, that
both patience in keeping silence and the duty of awaiting a fit time for
speaking are taught in this psalm, as well as contempt of riches in the
following verses, which things are the chief groundwork of virtues.
Whilst, therefore, meditating on this psalm, it has come to my mind to
write “on the Duties.”

<span id="iv.i.ii.vii-p4"></span>24. Although some philosophers have
written on this subject,—Panætius, <span id="fr_57"></span>[58](#fn_57.md)
for instance, and his son amongst the Greek, Cicero amongst the Latin,
writers—I did not think it foreign to my office to write also myself.
And as Cicero wrote for the instruction of his son, <span
id="fr_58"></span>[59](#fn_58.md) so I, too, write to teach you, my
children. For I love you, whom I have begotten in the Gospel, no less
than if you were my own true sons. For nature does not make us love more
ardently than grace. We certainly ought to love those who we think will
be with us for evermore than those who will be with us in this world
only. These often are born unworthy of their race, so as to bring
disgrace on their father; but you we chose beforehand, to love. They are
loved naturally, of necessity, which is not a sufficiently suitable and
constant teacher to implant a lasting love. But ye are loved on the
ground of our deliberate choice, whereby a great feeling of affection is
combined with the strength of our love: thus one tests what one loves
and loves what one has chosen.
