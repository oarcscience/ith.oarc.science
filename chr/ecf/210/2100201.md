<span id="iv.iv.iii.xix"></span>

#### <span id="iv.iv.iii.xix-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xix-p1"></span>The errors of the Arians are
mentioned in the Nicene Definition of the Faith, to prevent their
deceiving anybody. These errors are recited, together with the anathema
pronounced against them, which is said to have been not only pronounced
at Nicæa, but also twice renewed at Ariminum.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xix-p2"></span>118. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.iii.xix-p2.1"></span>Christ</span>, therefore, is “God of God,
Light of Light, very God of very God; begotten of the Father, not made;
of one substance with the Father.”

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xix-p3"></span>119. So, indeed, following the
guidance of the Scriptures, our fathers declared, holding, moreover,
that impious doctrines should be included in the record of their
decrees, in order that the unbelief of Arius should discover itself, and
not, as it were, mask itself with dye or face-paint. <span
id="fr_1870"></span>[1871](#fn_1870.md) For they give a false colour to
their thoughts who dare not unfold them openly. After the manner of the
censor’s rolls, then, the Arian heresy is not discovered by name, <span
id="fr_1871"></span>[1872](#fn_1871.md) but marked out by the condemnation
pronounced, in order that he who is curious and eager to hear it should
be preserved from falling by knowing that it is condemned already,
before he hears, it set forth to the end that he should believe.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xix-p6"></span>120. “Those,” runs the decree, “who
say that there was a time when the Son of God was not, and that before
He was born He was not, and who say that he was made out of nothing, or
is of another substance or <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iv.iii.xix-p6.1"></span>οὐσια</span>, <span
id="fr_1872"></span>[1873](#fn_1872.md) or that He is capable of changing,
or that with Him is any shadow of turning,—them the Catholic and
Apostolic Church declares accursed.”

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xix-p8"></span>121. Your sacred Majesty has agreed
that they who utter such doctrines are rightly condemned. It was of no
determination by man, of no human counsel, that three hundred and
eighteen bishops met, as I showed above more at length, <span
id="fr_1873"></span>[1874](#fn_1873.md) in Council, but that in their
number the Lord Jesus might prove, by the sign of His Name and Passion,
that He was in the midst, where His own were gathered together. <span
id="fr_1874"></span>[1875](#fn_1874.md) In the number of three hundred was
the sign of His Cross, in that <span id="page_221">p. 221</span> <span
id="iv.iv.iii.xix-Page_221"></span>of eighteen was the sign of the Name
Jesus.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xix-p11"></span>122. This also was the teaching of
the First Confession in the Council of Ariminum, and of the Second
Correction, after that Council. Of the Confession, the letter sent to
the Emperor Constantine beareth witness, and the Council that followed
declares the Correction. <span id="fr_1875"></span>[1876](#fn_1875.md)

<span id="fn_1870"></span>[220:1871](2100201.htm#fr_1870.md) <span
id="iv.iv.iii.xix-p3.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xix-p4"></span> *Fucus,* the word used by St.
Ambrose, denoted face-paint in general, but it seems to have also had
the especial meaning of a red pigment, or rouge for the cheeks. The
custom of face-painting was known of old in the East ([2 Kings
9:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#030.md), [Ezek.
23:40](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#040.md)<span
id="iv.iv.iii.xix-p4.1"></span>), whence, most probably, it passed into
Greece—it was known, in Ionia at least, when the *Odyssey* was written
(say 900 <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.iii.xix-p4.2"></span>b.c.</span>)—and thence to Rome. See
*Dict. Antiq.* art. “Fucus.”

<span id="fn_1871"></span>[220:1872](2100201.htm#fr_1871.md) <span
id="iv.iv.iii.xix-p4.3"></span>

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xix-p5"></span> An allusion to the practice of the
*nota censoria.* The censors, under the Republic, were vested with the
power of appointing properly qualified citizens to vacancies in the
Senate, and it was their duty to make up the roll of senators for each
*lustrum,* or period of five years. Exclusion from the Senate was simply
effected by omitting a senator’s name from the new list, and senators so
“unseated” were called *præteriti,* since their names had been passed
over and not read out with the rest. The decrees of the Fathers of the
Church laid down, as it were, the qualification for membership: all who
came under the description established by these decrees were regarded as
admitted—whilst those who, like the Arians, did not were tacitly
excluded. Or we might say that the Anathema, appended to the Nicene
symbol, excluded the Arians, not by name, but by description. In either
way, the exclusion was tacit, like the censorial, in so far as no
*names* were mentioned. In the case of exclusion from the Senate by the
censors, it was understood that the reason for exclusion was grave
immorality.

<span id="fn_1872"></span>[220:1873](2100201.htm#fr_1872.md) <span
id="iv.iv.iii.xix-p6.2"></span>

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xix-p7"></span> St. Ambrose has here rendered into
Latin the anathema appended to the original Nicene Creed of 325 <span
class="sc"><span id="iv.iv.iii.xix-p7.1"></span>a.d.</span> Notice
“substance or <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iv.iii.xix-p7.2"></span>οὐσία</span>.” The original is
*substantia vel* <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iv.iii.xix-p7.3"></span>οὐσίᾳ</span>. The closer Greek equivalent
of *substantia* is <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iv.iii.xix-p7.4"></span>ὑ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iv.iii.xix-p7.5"></span>πόστασις</span> (found in [Heb. i.
3](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003.md)<span
id="iv.iv.iii.xix-p7.6"></span>, and translated “person” in A.V.),
whilst the Latin for <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iv.iii.xix-p7.7"></span>οὐσία</span> is *essentia* (“essence”).
St. Ambrose appears to regard <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iv.iii.xix-p7.8"></span>οὐσία</span> as a proper equivalent of
*substantia,* whence we may perhaps infer that he also identified <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.iv.iii.xix-p7.9"></span>οὐσία</span> and
<span class="Greek"><span id="iv.iv.iii.xix-p7.10"></span>ὑ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.iv.iii.xix-p7.11"></span>πόστασις</span> in
meaning. But some distinguished the two, using the term <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.iv.iii.xix-p7.12"></span>οὐσία</span> in the
sense of “essence” or “substance” (*i.e.,* the Godhead) and <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.iv.iii.xix-p7.13"></span>ὑπόστασις</span> in
that of “person”—so that, according to them, there would be three
“hypostases” in the unity of the Godhead.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xix-p10"></span> S. [Matt. xviii.

<span id="fn_1875"></span>[221:1876](2100201.htm#fr_1875.md) <span
id="iv.iv.iii.xix-p11.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xix-p12"></span> The Council of Ariminum (Rimini on
the Adriatic coast of Italy) was held in 359 <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.iii.xix-p12.1"></span>a.d.</span>, Constantius being Emperor.
“The Bishops who attended the Council of Ariminum,” observes Hurter, “to
the number of more than 400, informed the Emperor that they had resolved
to allow no change in what had been determined upon at Nicæa. This is
the ‘first confession.’ That great confession, however, was not
maintained for long. Partly overawed by the Emperor, partly deceived by
the Arians, the Bishops agreed to strike out the words ‘substance’ and
‘consubstantial.’ After this came the ‘correction,’ which Ambrose calls
the ‘second,’ being made either by those Bishops who, recognizing their
error, withdrew the decrees of the Council held at Ariminum, or by the
Councils that followed—namely, the Councils of Alexandria (presided over
by Athanasius), of Paris (362 <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.iii.xix-p12.2"></span>a.d.</span>), and of Rome (held under
Pope Damasus, in <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.iii.xix-p12.3"></span>a.d.</span> 369).”

[Next: Chapter XIX. Arius is charged with the first of the
above-mentioned errors, and refuted by the testimony of St. John. The
miserable death of the Heresiarch is described, and the rest of his
blasphemous errors are one by one examined and disproved.](2100202.md)
