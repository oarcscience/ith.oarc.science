<span id="iv.i.iii.viii"></span>

#### <span id="iv.i.iii.viii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VIII.

<span id="iv.i.iii.viii-p1"></span>Nothing has greater effect in gaining
good-will than giving advice; but none can trust it unless it rests on
justice and prudence. How conspicuous these two virtues were in Solomon
is shown by his well-known judgment.

<span id="iv.i.iii.viii-p2"></span>40. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.iii.viii-p2.1"></span>Two</span> things, therefore, love and
confidence, are the most efficacious in commending us to others; also
this third quality if thou hast it, namely, what many consider to be
worthy of admiration in thee, and think to be rightly worthy of
honour <span id="fr_444"></span>[445](#fn_444.md) \[the power, in fact, of
giving good advice\].

<span id="iv.i.iii.viii-p4"></span>41. Since the giving of good advice
is a great means of gaining men’s affections, prudence and justice are
much needed in every case. These are looked for by most, so that
confidence at once is placed in him in whom they exist, because he can
give useful and trustworthy advice to whoever wants it. Who will put
himself into the hands of a man whom he does not think to be more wise
than himself who asks for advice? It is necessary therefore that he of
whom advice is asked should be superior to him who asks it. For why
should we consult a man when we do not think that he can make anything
more plain than we ourselves see it?

<span id="iv.i.iii.viii-p5"></span>42. But if we have found a man that
by the vigour of his character, by his strength of mind and influence,
stands forth above all others, and further, is better fitted by example
and experience than others; that can put an end to immediate dangers,
foresee future ones, point out those close at hand, can explain a
subject, bring relief in time, is ready not only to give advice but also
to give help,—in such a man confidence is placed, so that he who seeks
advice can say: “Though evil should happen to me through him, I will
bear it.” <span id="fr_445"></span>[446](#fn_445.md)

<span id="iv.i.iii.viii-p7"></span>43. To a man of this sort then we
entrust our safety and our reputation, for he is, as we said before,
just and prudent. Justice causes us to have no fear of deceit, and
prudence frees us from having any suspicions of error. However, we trust
ourselves more readily to a just than to a prudent man, to put it in the
way people generally do. But, according to the definition of the
philosophers, where there is one virtue, others exist too, <span
id="fr_446"></span>[447](#fn_446.md) whilst prudence cannot exist without
justice. We find this stated also in our writers, for David says: “The
just showeth mercy and lendeth.” <span id="fr_447"></span>[448](#fn_447.md)
What the just lends, he says elsewhere: “A good man is he that showeth
mercy and lendeth, he will guide his words with discretion.” <span
id="fr_448"></span>[449](#fn_448.md)

<span id="iv.i.iii.viii-p11"></span>44. Is not that noble judgment of
Solomon full of wisdom and justice? Let us see whether it is so. <span
id="fr_449"></span>[450](#fn_449.md) “Two women,” it says, “stood before
King Solomon, and the one said to him, Hear me, my lord, I and this
woman dwell in one house, and before the third day we gave birth and
bore a son apiece, and were together, there was no witness in the house,
nor any other woman with us, only we two alone. And her son died this
night, because she overlaid it, and she arose at midnight, and took my
son from my breast, and laid it in her bosom, and her dead child she
laid at my breast. And I arose in the morning to give my child suck, and
found him dead. And I considered it at dawn, and behold it was not my
son. And the other woman said, Nay, but the living is my son, and the
dead is thy son.”

<span id="iv.i.iii.viii-p13"></span>45. This was their dispute, in which
either tried to claim the living child for herself, and denied that the
dead one was hers. Then the king commanded a sword to be brought and the
infant to be cut in half, and either piece to be given to one, one half
to the one, and one half to the other. Then the woman whose the child
really was, moved by her feelings, cried out: “Divide not the child, my
lord; let it rather be given to her and live, and do not kill it.” But
the other answered: “Let it be neither mine nor hers, divide it.” Then
the king ordered that the <span id="page_51">p. 51</span> <span
id="iv.i.iii.viii-Page_51"></span>infant should be given to the woman
who had said: Do not kill it, but give it to that woman; “For,” as it
says, “her bowels yearned upon her son.” <span
id="fr_450"></span>[451](#fn_450.md)

<span id="iv.i.iii.viii-p15"></span>46. It is not wrong to suppose that
the mind of God was in him; for what is hidden from God? What can be
more hidden than the witness that lies deep within; into which the mind
of the wise king entered as though to judge a mother’s feelings, and
elicited as it were the voice of a mother’s heart. For a mother’s
feelings were laid bare, when she chose that her son should live with
another, rather than that he should be killed in his mother’s sight.

<span id="iv.i.iii.viii-p16"></span>47. It was therefore a sign of
wisdom to distinguish between secret heart-thoughts, to draw the truth
from hidden springs, and to pierce as it were with the sword of the
Spirit not only the inward parts of the body, but even of the mind and
soul. It was the part of justice also that she who had killed her own
child should not take away another’s, but that the real mother should
have her own back again. Indeed the Scriptures have declared this. “All
Israel,” it says, “heard of the judgment which the king had judged, and
they feared the king, for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him to
do judgment.” <span id="fr_451"></span>[452](#fn_451.md) Solomon also
himself had asked for wisdom, so that a prudent heart might be given him
to hear and to judge with justice. <span
id="fr_452"></span>[453](#fn_452.md)
