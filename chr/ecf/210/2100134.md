<span id="iv.ii.ii.xv"></span>

#### <span id="iv.ii.ii.xv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIV.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xv-p1"></span>Each Person of the Trinity is said in
the sacred writings to be Light. The Spirit is designated Fire by
Isaiah, a figure of which Fire was seen in the bush by Moses, in the
tongues of fire, and in Gideon’s pitchers. And the Godhead of the same
Spirit cannot be denied, since His operation is the same as that of the
Father and of the Son, and He is also called the light and fire of the
Lord’s countenance.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xv-p2"></span>160. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.ii.ii.xv-p2.1"></span>But</span> why should I argue that as the
Father is light, so, too, the Son is light, and the Holy Spirit is
light? Which certainly pertains to the power of God. For God is Light,
as John said: “For God is Light, and in Him is no darkness.” <span
id="fr_967"></span>[968](#fn_967)

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xv-p4"></span>161. But the Son, too, is Light,
because <span id="page_112">p. 112</span> <span
id="iv.ii.ii.xv-Page_112"></span>“the Life was the Light of men.” <span
id="fr_968"></span>[969](#fn_968) And the Evangelist, that he might show
that he was speaking of the Son of God, says of John the Baptist: “He
was not light, but \[was sent\] to be a witness of the Light. That was
the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into this
world.” <span id="fr_969"></span>[970](#fn_969) So, then, since God is
Light, and the Son of God the true Light, without doubt the Son of God
is true God.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xv-p7"></span>162. And you find elsewhere that the
Son of God is Light: “The people that sat in darkness and in the shadow
of death have seen a great light.” <span
id="fr_970"></span>[971](#fn_970) But, which is still more clear, it is
said: “For with Thee is the fount of Life, and in Thy light we shall see
light,” <span id="fr_971"></span>[972](#fn_971) which means that with
Thee, O God the Father Almighty, Who art the Fount of Life, in Thy Son
Who is the Light, we shall see the light of the Holy Spirit. As the Lord
Himself shows, saying: “Receive ye the Holy Spirit,” <span
id="fr_972"></span>[973](#fn_972) and elsewhere: “Virtue went out from
Him.” <span id="fr_973"></span>[974](#fn_973)

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xv-p12"></span>163. But who can doubt that the Father
is Light, when we read of His Son that He is the Brightness of eternal
Light? For of Whom but of the Father is the Son the Brightness, Who both
is always with the Father, and always shines, not with unlike but with
the same radiance.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xv-p13"></span>164. And Isaiah shows that the Holy
Spirit is not only Light but also Fire, saying: “And the light of Israel
shall be for a fire.” <span id="fr_974"></span>[975](#fn_974) So the
prophets called Him a burning Fire, because in those three points we see
more intensely the majesty of the Godhead; since to sanctify is of the
Godhead, to illuminate is the property of fire and light, and the
Godhead is wont to be pointed out or seen in the appearance of fire:
“For our God is a consuming Fire,” as Moses said. <span
id="fr_975"></span>[976](#fn_975)

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xv-p16"></span>165. For he himself saw the fire in
the bush, and had heard God when the voice from the flame of fire came
to him saying: “I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the
God of Jacob.” <span id="fr_976"></span>[977](#fn_976) The voice came
from the fire, and the voice was in the bush, and the fire did no harm.
For the bush was burning but was not consumed, because in that mystery
the Lord was showing that He would come to illuminate the thorns of our
body, and not to consume those who were in misery, but to alleviate
their misery; Who would baptize with the Holy Spirit and with fire, that
He might give grace and destroy sin. <span
id="fr_977"></span>[978](#fn_977) So in the symbol of fire God keeps His
intention.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xv-p19"></span>166. In the Acts of the Apostles,
also, when the Holy Spirit had descended upon the faithful, the
appearance of fire was seen, for you read thus: “And suddenly there was
a sound from heaven, as though the Spirit were borne with great
vehemence, and it filled all the house where they were sitting, and
there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire.” <span
id="fr_978"></span>[979](#fn_978)

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xv-p21"></span>167. For the same reason was it that
when Gideon was about to overcome the Midianites, he commanded three
hundred men to take pitchers, and to hold lighted torches inside the
pitchers, and trumpets in their right hands. Our predecessors have
preserved the explanation received from the apostles, that the pitchers
are our bodies, fashioned of clay, which know not fear if they burn with
the fervour of the grace of the Spirit, and bear witness to the passion
of the Lord Jesus with a loud confession of the Voice.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xv-p22"></span>168. Who, then, can doubt of the
Godhead of the Holy Spirit, since where the grace of the Spirit is,
there the manifestation of the Godhead appears. By which evidence we
infer not a diversity but the unity of the divine power. For how can
there be a severance of power, where the effect of the working in all is
one?

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xv-p23"></span>169. What, then, is that fire? Not
certainly one made up of common twigs, or roaring with the burning of
the reeds of the woods, but that fire which improves good deeds like
gold, and consumes sins like stubble. This is undoubtedly the Holy
Spirit, Who is called both the fire and light of the countenance of God;
light as we said above: “The light of Thy countenance has been sealed
upon us, O Lord.” <span id="fr_979"></span>[980](#fn_979) What is, then,
the light that is sealed, but that of the seal of the Spirit, believing
in Whom, “ye were sealed,” he says, “with the Holy Spirit of
promise.” <span id="fr_980"></span>[981](#fn_980)

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xv-p26"></span>170. And as there is a light of the
divine countenance, so, too, does fire shine forth from the countenance
of God, for it is written: “A fire shall burn in His sight.” <span
id="fr_981"></span>[982](#fn_981) For the grace of the day of judgment
shines beforehand, that forgiveness may follow to reward the service of
the saints. O the great fulness of the Scriptures, which no one can
comprehend with human genius! O greatest proof of the Divine Unity! For
how many things are pointed out in these two verses!
