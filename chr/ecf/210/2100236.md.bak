<span id="iv.iv.v.xiv"></span>

#### <span id="iv.iv.v.xiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIV.

<span id="iv.iv.v.xiv-p1"></span>The Son is of one substance with the
Father.

<span id="iv.iv.v.xiv-p2"></span>108. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.v.xiv-p2.1"></span>And</span> now, your Majesty, with regard
to the question of the substance, why need I tell you that the Son is of
one substance <span id="page_258">p. 258</span> <span
id="iv.iv.v.xiv-Page_258"></span>with the Father, when we have read that
the Son is the image of the Father’s substance, that you may understand
that there is nothing wherein, so far as Godhead is regarded, the Son
differs from the Father.

<span id="iv.iv.v.xiv-p3"></span>109. In virtue of this likeness Christ
said: “All things that the Father hath are Mine.” <span
id="fr_2285"></span>[2286](#fn_2285.md) We cannot, then, deny substance to
God, for indeed He is not unsubstantial, Who hath given to others the
ground of their being, though this be different in God from what it is
in the creature. The Son of God, by Whose agency all things
endure, <span id="fr_2286"></span>[2287](#fn_2286.md) could not be
unsubstantial.

<span id="iv.iv.v.xiv-p6"></span>110. And therefore, the Psalmist saith:
“My bones are not hidden, which Thou didst make in secret, and my
substance in the underworld.” <span id="fr_2287"></span>[2288](#fn_2287.md)
For to His power and Godhead, the things that before the foundation of
the world were done, though their magnificence was \[as yet\] invisible,
could not be hidden. Here, then, we find mention of “substance.”

<span id="iv.iv.v.xiv-p8"></span>111. But it may be objected that the
mention of His substance is the consequence of His Incarnation. I have
shown that the word “substance” is used more than once, and that not in
the sense of inherited possessions, as you would construe it. Now, if it
please you, let us grant that, in accordance with the mystic prophecy,
the substance of Christ was present in the underworld—for truly He did
exert His power in the lower world to set free, in the soul which
animated His own body, the souls of the dead, to loose the bands of
death, to remit sins. <span id="fr_2288"></span>[2289](#fn_2288.md)

<span id="iv.iv.v.xiv-p10"></span>112. And, indeed, what hinders you
from understanding, by that substance, His divine substance, seeing that
God is everywhere, so that it hath been said to Him: “If I go up into
heaven, Thou art there; if I go down into hell, Thou art present.” <span
id="fr_2289"></span>[2290](#fn_2289.md)

<span id="iv.iv.v.xiv-p12"></span>113. Furthermore, the Psalmist hath in
the words following made it plain that we must understand the divine
substance to be mentioned when he saith: “Thine eyes did see My being,
\[as\] not the effect of working;” <span
id="fr_2290"></span>[2291](#fn_2290.md) inasmuch as the Son is not made,
nor one of God’s works, but the begotten Word of eternal power. He
called Him “<span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iv.v.xiv-p13.2"></span>ἀχατέργαστον</span>,” meaning that the
Word neither made nor created, is begotten of the Father without the
witnessing presence of any created being. Howbeit, we have abundance of
testimony besides this. Let us grant that the substance here spoken of
is the bodily substance, provided you also yourself say not that the Son
of God is something effected by working, but confess His uncreated
Godhead.

<span id="iv.iv.v.xiv-p14"></span>114. Now I know that some assert that
the mystic incarnate form was uncreated, forasmuch as nothing was done
therein through intercourse with a man, because our Lord was the
offspring of a virgin. If, then, many have, on the strength of this
passage, asserted that neither that which was brought forth of Mary was
produced by creative operation, dare you, disciple of Arius, think that
the Word of God is something so produced?

<span id="iv.iv.v.xiv-p15"></span>115. But is this the only place where
we read of “substance”? Hath it not also been said in another passage:
“The gates of the cities are broken down, the mountains are fallen, and
His substance is revealed”? <span id="fr_2291"></span>[2292](#fn_2291.md)
What, does the word mean something created here also? Some, I know, are
accustomed to say that the substance is substance in money. Then, if you
give this meaning to the word, the mountains fell, in order that some
one’s possessions of money might be seen.

<span id="iv.iv.v.xiv-p17"></span>116. But let us remember *what*
mountains fell, those, namely, of which it hath been said: “If ye shall
have faith as a grain of mustard seed ye shall say to this mountain: Be
thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea!” <span
id="fr_2292"></span>[2293](#fn_2292.md) By mountains, then, are meant high
things that exalt themselves. <span id="fr_2293"></span>[2294](#fn_2293.md)

<span id="iv.iv.v.xiv-p20"></span>117. Moreover, in the Greek, the
rendering is this: “The palaces are fallen.” What palaces, save the
palace of Satan, of whom the Lord said: “How shall His kingdom
stand?” <span id="fr_2294"></span>[2295](#fn_2294.md) We are reading,
therefore, of the things which are the devil’s palaces as being very
mountains, and therefore in the fall of those palaces from the hearts of
the faithful, the truth stands revealed, that Christ, the <span
id="page_259">p. 259</span> <span id="iv.iv.v.xiv-Page_259"></span>Son
of God, is of the Father’s eternal substance. What, again, are those
mountains of bronze, from the midst of which four chariots come
forth? <span id="fr_2295"></span>[2296](#fn_2295.md)

<span id="iv.iv.v.xiv-p23"></span>118. We behold that height, lifting up
itself against the knowledge of God, cast down by the word of the Lord,
when the Son of God said: “Hold thy peace, and come forth, thou foul
spirit.” <span id="fr_2296"></span>[2297](#fn_2296.md) Concerning whom the
prophet also said: “Behold, I am come to thee, thou mount of
corruption!” <span id="fr_2297"></span>[2298](#fn_2297.md)

<span id="iv.iv.v.xiv-p26"></span>119. *Those* mountains, then, are
fallen, <span id="fr_2298"></span>[2299](#fn_2298.md) and it is revealed
that in Christ was the substance of God, in the words of those who had
seen Him: “Truly Thou art the Son of God,” <span
id="fr_2299"></span>[2300](#fn_2299.md) for it was in virtue of divine, not
human power, that He commanded devils. Jeremiah also saith: “Make
mourning upon the mountains, and beat your breasts upon the desert
tracks, for they have failed; forasmuch as there are no men, they have
not heard the word of substance: from flying fowl to beasts of burden,
they trembled, they have failed.” <span
id="fr_2300"></span>[2301](#fn_2300.md)

<span id="iv.iv.v.xiv-p30"></span>120. Nor has it escaped us, that in
another place also, setting forth the frailties of man’s estate, in
order to show that He had taken upon Himself the infirmity of the flesh,
and the affections of our minds, the Lord said, by the mouth of His
prophet: “Remember, O Lord, what My substance is,” <span
id="fr_2301"></span>[2302](#fn_2301.md) because it was the Son of God
speaking in the nature of human frailty. <span
id="fr_2302"></span>[2303](#fn_2302.md)

<span id="iv.iv.v.xiv-p33"></span>121. Of Him the Scripture saith, in
the passage cited, <span id="fr_2303"></span>[2304](#fn_2303.md) in order
to discover the mysteries of the Incarnation: “But Thou hast rejected, O
Lord, and counted for nought—Thou hast cast out Thy Christ. <span
id="fr_2304"></span>[2305](#fn_2304.md) Thou hast overthrown the covenant
made with Thy Servant, and trampled His holiness in the earth.” <span
id="fr_2305"></span>[2306](#fn_2305.md) What was it, in regard whereof the
Scripture called Him “Servant,” but His flesh?—seeing that “He did not
hold equality with God as a prey, but emptied Himself, taking the form
of a servant, being made into the likeness of men, and found in fashion
as a man.” <span id="fr_2306"></span>[2307](#fn_2306.md) So, then, in that
He took upon Himself My nature, He was a servant, but by virtue of His
own power He is the Lord.

<span id="iv.iv.v.xiv-p38"></span>122. Furthermore, what meaneth it that
thou readest: “Who hath stood in the *truth* (*substantia*) of the
Lord?” and again: “Now if they had stood in My *truth*, and had given
ear to My words, and had taught My people, I would have turned them from
their follies and transgressions”? <span
id="fr_2307"></span>[2308](#fn_2307.md)

with one or two variations in the punctuation. What St. Ambrose renders
as “*vox substantiæ*” (“word of substance” or “voice of substance”)
appears in the LXX. as “<span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iv.v.xiv-p29.2"></span>φωνὴ ὑπάρξεως</span>” (which *vox
substantiæ* represents verbatim), and in Vulg. as “*vox possidentis*”
(“the voice of the possessor”—*i.e.* landowner); in the A.V. and R.V. as
“the voice of the cattle.”—<span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iv.v.xiv-p29.3"></span>ὐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iv.v.xiv-p29.4"></span>παρξις</span> and *substantia* should be
taken in the *concrete* sense (as they clearly represent a concrete
term), like our “substance,” or “possessions.” Now in primitive
society—like, *e.g.,* that of the nomad Tartars—possessions consist
mainly in horses and *cattle*. Cf. the evolution of the term
*pecunia*=money.

[Next: Chapter XV. The Arians, inasmuch as they assert the Son to be “of
another substance,” plainly acknowledge substance in God. The only
reason why they avoid the use of this term is that they will not, as
Eusebius of Nicomedia has made it evident, confess Christ to be the true
Son of God.](2100237.md)
