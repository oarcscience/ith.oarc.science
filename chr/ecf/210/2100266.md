<span id="iv.iv.vii.xiii"></span>

#### <span id="iv.iv.vii.xiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XII.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xiii-p1"></span>He confirms what has been already
said, by the parable of the rich man who went into a far country to
receive for himself a kingdom; and shows that when the Son delivers up
the kingdom to the Father, we must not regard the fact that the Father
is said to put all things in subjection under Him, in a disparaging way.
Here we are the kingdom of Christ, and in Christ’s kingdom. Hereafter we
shall be in the kingdom of God, where the Trinity will reign together.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xiii-p2"></span>145. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.vii.xiii-p2.1"></span>In</span> divine fashion has He
represented that parable of the rich man, who went to a far-off country
to receive a kingdom, and to return, <span
id="fr_2707"></span>[2708](#fn_2707.md) thus describing Himself in the
substance of the Godhead, and of His Manhood. For He being rich in the
fulness of His Godhead, Who was made poor for us though He was rich and
an eternal King, and the Son of an eternal King; He, I say, went to a
foreign country in taking on Him a body, for He entered upon the ways of
men as though upon a strange journey, and came into this world to
prepare for Himself a kingdom from amongst us.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xiii-p4"></span>146. Jesus therefore came to this
earth to receive for Himself a kingdom from us, to whom He says: “The
kingdom of God is within you.” <span
id="fr_2708"></span>[2709](#fn_2708.md) This is the kingdom which Christ
has received, this the kingdom which He has delivered to the Father. For
how did He receive for Himself a kingdom, Who was a King eternal? “The
Son of Man therefore came to receive a kingdom and to return.” The Jews
were unwilling to acknowledge Him, of whom He says: “They which would
not that I should reign over them, bring hither and slay them.” <span
id="fr_2709"></span>[2710](#fn_2709.md)

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xiii-p7"></span>147. Let us follow the course of the
Scriptures. He Who came will deliver up the kingdom to God the Father;
and when He has delivered up the kingdom, then also shall He be subject
to Him, Who has put all things in subjection under Him, that God may be
all in all. <span id="fr_2710"></span>[2711](#fn_2710.md) If the Son of God
has received the kingdom as Son of Man, surely as Son of Man also He
will deliver up what He has received. If He delivers it up as Son of
Man, as Son of Man He confesses His subjection indeed under the
conditions of the flesh, and not in the majesty of His Godhead.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xiii-p9"></span>148. And dost thou make objections
and contemn Him, because God has put all things in subjection under Him,
when thou hearest that the Son of Man delivers up the kingdom to God,
and hast read, as we said in our earlier books: “No man can come to Me,
except the Father draw him; and I will raise him up at the last
day”? <span id="fr_2711"></span>[2712](#fn_2711.md) If we follow it
literally, see rather and notice the unity of honour each gives to
other: The Father has put all things in subjection under the Son, and
the Son delivers the kingdom to the Father. Say now which is the
greater, to deliver up, or to raise up to life? Do we not after human
fashion speak of the service of delivering up, and the power of raising
to life? But both the Son delivers up to the Father, and also the Father
to the Son. The Son raises to life, and the Father also raises to life.
Let them create the fiction of a blasphemous division where there is a
unity of power.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xiii-p11"></span>149. Let the Son then deliver up
His kingdom to the Father. The kingdom which He delivers up is not lost
to Christ, but grows. We are the kingdom, for it was said to us: “The
kingdom of God is within you.” <span
id="fr_2712"></span>[2713](#fn_2712.md) And we are the kingdom, first of
Christ, then of the Father; as it is written: “No man cometh to the
Father, but by Me.” <span id="fr_2713"></span>[2714](#fn_2713.md) When I am
on the way, I am Christ’s; when I have passed through, I am the
Father’s; but everywhere through Christ, and everywhere under Him.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xiii-p14"></span>150. It is a good thing to be in
the kingdom of Christ, so that Christ may be with us; as He Himself
says: “Lo I am with you always, even unto the end of the world.” <span
id="fr_2714"></span>[2715](#fn_2714.md) But it is better to be with Christ:
<span id="page_303">p. 303</span> <span
id="iv.iv.vii.xiii-Page_303"></span>“For to depart and be with Christ is
far better.” <span id="fr_2715"></span>[2716](#fn_2715.md) Though we are
under sin in this world, Christ is with us, that “by the obedience of
one man many may be made just.” <span
id="fr_2716"></span>[2717](#fn_2716.md) And if I escape the sin of this
world, I shall begin to be with Christ. And so He says: “I will come
again, and receive you unto Myself;” <span
id="fr_2717"></span>[2718](#fn_2717.md) and further on: “I will that where
I am, there ye may be also with Me.” <span
id="fr_2718"></span>[2719](#fn_2718.md)

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xiii-p20"></span>151. Therefore we are now under
Christ’s rule, whilst we are in the body, and are not yet stripped of
the form of a servant, which He put upon Him, when He “emptied Himself.”
But when we shall see His glory, which He had before the world was, we
shall be in the kingdom of God, in which are the patriarchs and
prophets, of whom it is written: “When ye shall see Abraham, Isaac, and
Jacob, and all the prophets in the kingdom of God;” <span
id="fr_2719"></span>[2720](#fn_2719.md) and shall thus acquire a deeper
knowledge of God.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xiii-p22"></span>152. But in the kingdom of the Son
the Father also reigns; and in the kingdom of the Father the Son also
reigns: for the Father is in the Son, and the Son in the Father; and in
whomsoever the Son dwells, in him also the Father dwells; and in
whomsoever the Father dwells, in him also the Son dwells, as it is
written: “Both I and My Father will come to Him, and make Our abode with
Him.” <span id="fr_2720"></span>[2721](#fn_2720.md) Thus as there is one
dwelling, so also there is one kingdom. Yea, and so far is the kingdom
of the Father and of the Son but one, that the Father receives what the
Son delivers, and the Son does not lose what the Father receives. Thus
in the one kingdom there is a unity of power. Let no one therefore sever
the Godhead between the Father and the Son.

[Next: Chapter XIII. With the desire to learn what subjection to Christ
means after putting forward and rejecting various ideas of subjection,
he runs through the Apostle's words; and so puts an end to the
blasphemous opinions of the heretics on this matter. The subjection,
which is shown to be future, cannot concern the Godhead, since there has
always been the greatest harmony of wills between the Father and the
Son. Also to that same Son in His Godhead all things have indeed been
made subject; but they are said to be not yet subject to Him in this
sense, because all men do not obey His commands. But after that they
have been made subject, then shall Christ also be made subject in them,
and the Father's work be perfected.](2100267.md)
