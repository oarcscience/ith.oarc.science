### <span id="iv.iv.vi-p0.1"></span>Book IV.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Next: Chapter I. The marvel is, not that men have failed to know
Christ, but that they have not listened to the words of the Scriptures.
Christ, indeed, was not known, even of angels, save by revelation, nor
again, by His forerunner. Follows a description of Christ's triumphal
ascent into heaven, and the excellence of its glory over the assumption
of certain prophets. Lastly, from exposition of the conversation with
angels upon this occasion, the omnipotence of the Son is proved, as
against the Arians.](2100241)
