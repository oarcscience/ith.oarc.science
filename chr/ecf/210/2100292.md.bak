<span id="iv.vi.ii.v"></span>

#### <span id="iv.vi.ii.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.v-p1"></span>The objection from the unchangeableness
of God is answered from several passages of Scripture, wherein God
promises forgiveness to sinners on their repentance. St. Ambrose also
shows that mercy will be more readily accorded to such as have sinned,
as it were, against their will, which he illustrates by the case of
prisoners taken in war, and by language put into the mouth of the devil.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.v-p2"></span>21. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.v-p2.1"></span>But</span> they say that they make these
assertions in order not to seem to make God liable to change, as He
would be if He forgave those with whom He was angry. What then? Shall we
reject the utterances of God and follow their opinions? But God is not
to be judged by the statements of others, but by His own words. What
mark of His mercy have we more ready at hand than that He Himself,
through the prophet Hosea, is at once merciful as though reconciled to
those whom in His anger He had threatened? For He says: “O Ephraim, what
shall I do unto thee, or what shall I do unto thee, O Judah? Your
kindness,” etc. <span id="fr_2938"></span>[2939](#fn_2938.md) And further
on: “How shall I establish thee? I will make thee as Admah, and as
Zeboim.” <span id="fr_2939"></span>[2940](#fn_2939.md) In the midst of His
indignation He hesitates, as it were, with fatherly love, doubting how
He can give over the wanderer to punishment; for although the Jew
deserves it, God yet takes counsel with Himself. For immediately after
having said, “I will make thee as Admah and as Zeboim,” which cities,
owing to their nearness to Sodom, suffered together in like destruction,
He adds, “My heart is turned against Me, My compassion is aroused, I
will not do according to the fierceness of Mine anger.” <span
id="fr_2940"></span>[2941](#fn_2940.md)

<span id="iv.vi.ii.v-p6"></span><span id="page_333">p. 333</span> <span
id="iv.vi.ii.v-Page_333"></span>22. Is it not evident that the Lord
Jesus is angry with us when we sin in order that He may convert us
through fear of His indignation? His indignation, then, is not the
carrying out of vengeance, but rather the working out of forgiveness,
for these are His words: “If thou shalt turn and lament, thou shalt be
saved.” <span id="fr_2941"></span>[2942](#fn_2941.md) He waits for our
lamentations here, that is, in time, that He may spare us those which
shall be eternal. He waits for our tears, that He may pour forth His
goodness. So in the Gospel, having pity on the tears of the widow, He
raised her son. He waits for our conversion, that He may Himself restore
us to grace, which would have continued with us had no fall overtaken
us. But He is angry because we have by our sins incurred guilt, in order
that we may be humbled; we are humbled, in order that we may be found
worthy rather of pity than of punishment.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.v-p8"></span>23. Jeremiah, too, may certainly teach
when he says: “For the Lord will not cast off for ever; for after He has
humbled, He will have compassion according to the multitude of His
mercies, Who hath not humbled from His whole heart nor cast off the
children of men.” <span id="fr_2942"></span>[2943](#fn_2942.md) This
passage we certainly find in the Lamentations of Jeremiah, and from it,
and from what follows, we note that the Lord humbles all the prisoners
of the earth under His feet, <span id="fr_2943"></span>[2944](#fn_2943.md)
in order that we may escape His judgment. But He does not bring down the
sinner even to the earth with His whole heart Who raises the poor even
from the dust and the needy from the dunghill. For He brings not down
with His whole heart Who reserves the intention of forgiving.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.v-p11"></span>24. But if He brings not down every
sinner with His whole heart, how much less does He bring down him with
His whole heart who has not sinned with his whole heart! For as He said
of the Jews: “This people honoureth Me with their lips, but their heart
is far from Me,” <span id="fr_2944"></span>[2945](#fn_2944.md) so perhaps
He may say of some of the fallen: “They denied Me with their lips, but
in heart they are with Me. It was pain which overcame them, not
unfaithfulness which turned them aside.” <span
id="fr_2945"></span>[2946](#fn_2945.md) But some without cause refuse
pardon to those whose faith the persecutor himself confessed up to the
point of striving to overcome it by torture. They denied the Lord once,
but confess Him daily; they denied Him in word, but confess Him with
groans, with cries, and with tears; they confess Him with willing words,
not under compulsion. They yielded, indeed, for a moment to the
temptation of the devil, but even the devil afterwards departed from
those whom he was unable to claim as his own. He yielded to their
weeping, he yielded to their repentance, and after making them his own
lost those whom he attached when they belonged to Another.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.v-p14"></span>25. Is not the case such as when any
one carries away captive the people of a conquered city? The captive is
led away, but against his will. He must of necessity go to foreign
lands, does not willingly make the journey; he takes his native land
with him in his heart, and seeks an opportunity to return. What then?
When any such return, does any one urge that they should not be
received; with less honour indeed, but with readier will, that the enemy
may have nothing with which to reproach them? If you pardon an armed man
who was able to fight, do you not pardon him in whom faith alone waged
the battle?

<span id="iv.vi.ii.v-p15"></span>26. If we were to enquire what is the
opinion of the devil concerning those who have fallen after this sort,
would he not probably reply: “This people honours me with their lips,
but their heart is far from me? For how can he be with me who does not
depart from Christ? Without any cause do they appear to honour me who
keep the doctrine of Jesus, and I thought that they would teach mine.
They condemn me all the more when they forsake me after trial. Indeed
Jesus is more glorified in these, when He receives them on their return
to Him. All the angels rejoice, for in heaven there is greater joy over
one sinner that repents, than over ninety and nine just persons who need
not repentance. I am triumphed over in heaven and on earth. Christ loses
nothing when they who came to me with weeping return with longing to the
Church, and I am in danger even as regards my own, who will learn that
in reality there is nothing here where men are led on by present
rewards, but that there must be very much there where groans and tears
and fasts are preferred to my feasts.”
