<span id="iv.iv.v.i"></span>

#### <span id="iv.iv.v.i-p0.1"></span>Chapter I.

<span id="iv.iv.v.i-p1"></span>Statement of the reasons wherefore the
matters, treated of shortly in the two former, are dealt with more at
length in the three later books. Defence of the employment of fables,
which is supported by the example of Holy Writ, wherein are found
various figures of poetic fable, in particular the Sirens, which are
figures of sensual pleasures, and which Christians ought to be taught to
avoid, by the words of Paul and the deeds of Christ.

<span id="iv.iv.v.i-p2"></span>1. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.v.i-p2.1"></span>Forasmuch</span> as your most gracious
Majesty had laid command upon me to write for your own instruction some
treatise concerning the Faith, and had yourself called me to your
presence and encouraged my timidity, I, being as one on the eve of
battle, <span id="fr_2096"></span>[2097](#fn_2096) composed but two
books only, for the pointing out of certain ways and paths by which our
faith progresses.

<span id="iv.iv.v.i-p4"></span>2. Seeing, however, that certain
malicious minds, bent on sowing disputes, have not yet exhausted the
force of their assaults, whilst your gracious Majesty’s pious anxiety
calls me to further labours, inasmuch as you desire to try in more
things him whom you have proved in a few, I am resolved to deal somewhat
more particularly with the matters whereof I have already treated in a
few words, lest it should be thought, not that I have advanced those
propositions in quietness and confidence, but that I, having asserted
them, doubted and so abandoned their defence.

<span id="iv.iv.v.i-p5"></span>3. Again, seeing that we spoke of the
Hydra and Scylla (I. vi. 46), and brought them in by way of comparison,
to show how we must beware, whether of the ever-renewed outgrowths of
infidelity, or the ill-omened shipwrecks made upon its shallows, if any
one holds that such embellishments of an argument, borrowed from the
romances of poets, are unlawful, and, from lack of opportunity to speak
evil of my faith, assails something in my language, then let him know
that not only phrases but complete verses of poetry have been woven into
the text of Holy Writ.

<span id="iv.iv.v.i-p6"></span>4. Whence, for instance, came that verse,
“His offspring truly are we,” <span id="fr_2097"></span>[2098](#fn_2097)
whereof Paul, by prophetic experience, <span
id="fr_2098"></span>[2099](#fn_2098) taught, makes use? The course of
prophetic speech avoids neither the Giants <span
id="fr_2099"></span>[2100](#fn_2099) nor the Valley of the Titans, <span
id="fr_2100"></span>[2101](#fn_2100) and Isaiah spake of sirens and the
<span id="page_243">p. 243</span> <span
id="iv.iv.v.i-Page_243"></span>daughters of ostriches. <span
id="fr_2101"></span>[2102](#fn_2101) Jeremiah also hath prophesied
concerning Babylon, that the daughters of sirens shall dwell
therein, <span id="fr_2102"></span>[2103](#fn_2102) in order to show
that the snares of Babylon, that is, of the tumult of this world, are to
be likened to stories of old-time lust, that seemed upon this life’s
rocky shores to sing some tuneful song, but deadly withal, to catch the
souls of youth,—which the Greek poet himself tells us that the wise man
escaped through being bound, as it were, in the chains of his own
prudence. <span id="fr_2103"></span>[2104](#fn_2103) So hard a thing,
before Christ’s coming, was it esteemed, even for the stronger, to save
themselves from the deceitful shows and allurements of pleasure.

<span id="iv.iv.v.i-p14"></span>5. But if the poet judged the enticement
of worldly pleasure and licence destructive of men’s minds and a sure
cause of shipwreck, what ought we to think, for whom it hath been
written: “Train not the flesh in concupiscence”? <span
id="fr_2104"></span>[2105](#fn_2104) And again: “I chastise my body and
bring it into servitude, lest whilst I preach to others, I myself become
a castaway.” <span id="fr_2105"></span>[2106](#fn_2105)

<span id="iv.iv.v.i-p17"></span>6. Truly, Christ won salvation for us,
not by luxury but by fasting. Moreover, it was not to obtain favour for
Himself, but to instruct us, that He fasted. Nor yet did He hunger
because He was overcome by the weakness of the body, but by His hunger
He proved that He had verily taken upon Himself a body; that so He might
teach us that He had taken not only our body, but also the weaknesses of
that body, even as it is written: “Surely He hath taken our infirmities
and borne our sicknesses.” <span id="fr_2106"></span>[2107](#fn_2106)

<span id="fn_2096"></span>[242:2097](2100223.htm#fr_2096) <span
id="iv.iv.v.i-p2.2"></span>

<span id="iv.iv.v.i-p3"></span> Lat. “*In procinctu,*” which is
primarily a military phrase, *procinctus* meaning “girding up” or
“girdle,” the expression having reference to the girding on of armour
for the battle. “*Testamentum facere in procinctu*” means “to make one’s
will on the eve of battle.” The expression passed into a proverb for
readiness in general. *E.g.* “*clementiam in procinctu habere,*” “to be
ready to show mercy.” Here, however, St. Ambrose uses the phrase more in
its original sense, with reference to the impending conflict of the
Goths and Romans, in which Gratian was expecting to take part, though,
as a matter of fact, the battle of Hadrianople had been fought, and
Valens was dead, before he arrived on the scene of action.

<span id="iv.iv.v.i-p8"></span> Meaning that Paul, gifted with a
prophet’s insight into divine truth, recognized in these words of the
heathen poet a testimony to God, and therefore had no scruples about
citing them to this Athenian audience.

<span id="iv.iv.v.i-p11"></span> [Isa. xiii.
22](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#022)<span id="iv.iv.v.i-p11.1"></span>—a
passage referring to the desolation of Babylon. In this verse of Isaiah
the LXX. has “<span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iv.v.i-p11.2"></span>ὀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iv.v.i-p11.3"></span>νοκένταυροι</span>” and “<span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.iv.v.i-p11.4"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.iv.v.i-p11.5"></span>χῖνοι</span>”
(onocentaurs and hedgehogs), the “sirens” (<span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iv.v.i-p11.6"></span>σειρῆνες</span>) coming in ver. 21b, in
combination with “demons” (<span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iv.v.i-p11.7"></span>δαιμόνια</span>). The Vulgate has in 22
“*ululæ*” (screech-owls) and “*sirenes,*” with “*struthiones*”
(ostriches) and “*pilosi*” (hairy men) in 21b. A.V. has in 22 “wild
beasts of the islands” and “dragons;” in 21b, “owls” (marg. “ostriches,”
the Hebrew meaning “daughters of the owl”) and “satyrs.” R.V. in 22,
“wolves” and “jackals;” in 21b, “ostriches” and “satyrs” (marg.
“he-goats”). The “sirens” then appear to be jackals—though the ground of
the comparison is hard to find—the “daughters of sparrows” are ostriches
(the Greek name for which means, literally, “sparrow-camel”).

[Next: Chapter II. The incidents properly affecting the body which
Christ for our sake took upon Him are not to be accounted to His
Godhead, in respect whereof He is the Most Highest. To deny which is to
say that the Father was incarnate. When we read that God is one, and
that there is none other beside Him, or that He alone has immortality,
this must be understood as true of Christ also, not only to avoid the
sinful heresy above-mentioned (Patripassianism), but also because the
activity of the Father and the Son is declared to be one and the
same.](2100224)
