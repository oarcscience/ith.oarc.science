<span id="iv.iv.vii.viii"></span>

#### <span id="iv.iv.vii.viii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VII.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.viii-p1"></span>Objection is taken to the following
passage: “Thou hast loved them, as Thou hast loved Me.” To remove it, he
shows first the impiety of the Arian explanation; then compares these
words with others; and lastly, takes the whole passage into
consideration. Hence he gathers that the mission of Christ, although it
is to be received according to the flesh, is not to His detriment. When
this is proved he shows how the divine mission takes place.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.viii-p2"></span>88. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.vii.viii-p2.1"></span>There</span> are some, O Emperor
Augustus, who in their desire to deny the unity of the divine Substance,
strive to make little of the love of the Father and the Son, because it
is written: “Thou hast loved them, as Thou hast loved Me.” <span
id="fr_2614"></span>[2615](#fn_2614.md) But when they say this, what else
do they do but adopt a likeness of comparison between the Son of God and
men?

<span id="iv.iv.vii.viii-p4"></span>89. Can men indeed be loved by God
as the Son is, in Whom the Father is well-pleased? <span
id="fr_2615"></span>[2616](#fn_2615.md) He is well-pleasing in Himself; we
through Him. For those in whom God sees His own Son after His own
likeness, He admits through His Son into the favour of sons. So that as
we go through likeness unto likeness, so through the Generation of the
Son are we called unto adoption. The eternal love of God’s Nature is one
thing, that of grace is another.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.viii-p6"></span>90. And if they start a debate on
the words that are written: “And Thou hast loved them, as Thou hast
loved Me,” and think a comparison is intended; they must think that the
following also was said by way of comparison: “Be ye merciful, as your
Father Which is in heaven is merciful;” <span
id="fr_2616"></span>[2617](#fn_2616.md) and elsewhere: “Be ye perfect, as
My Father Which is in heaven is perfect.” <span
id="fr_2617"></span>[2618](#fn_2617.md) But if He is perfect in the fulness
of His glory, we are but perfect according to the growth of virtue
within us. The Son also is loved by the Father according to the fulness
of a love that ever abideth, but in us growth in grace merits the love
of God.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.viii-p9"></span>91. Thou seest, then, how God has
given grace to men, and dost thou wish to dissever the natural and
indivisible love of the Father and the Son? And dost thou still strive
to make nothing of words, where thou dost note the mention of a unity of
majesty?

<span id="iv.iv.vii.viii-p10"></span>92. Consider the whole of this
passage, and see from what standpoint He speaks; for thou hearest Him
saying: “Father, glorify Thou Me with the glory which I had with Thee
before the world was.” <span id="fr_2618"></span>[2619](#fn_2618.md) See
how He speaks from the standpoint of the first man. For He begs for us
in that request those things which, as Man, He remembered were granted
in paradise before the Fall, as also He spoke of it to the thief at His
Passion: “Verily, verily, I say unto thee, today shalt thou be with Me
in paradise.” <span id="fr_2619"></span>[2620](#fn_2619.md) This is the
glory before the world was. <span id="page_296">p. 296</span> <span
id="iv.iv.vii.viii-Page_296"></span>But He used the word “world” instead
“men,” as also thou hast it: “Lo! the whole world goeth after
Him;” <span id="fr_2620"></span>[2621](#fn_2620.md) and again “That the
world may know that Thou hast sent Me.” <span
id="fr_2621"></span>[2622](#fn_2621.md)

<span id="iv.iv.vii.viii-p15"></span>93. But that thou mightest know the
great God, even the life-giving and Almighty Son of God, He has added a
proof of His majesty by saying: “And all Mine are Thine, and Thine are
Mine.” <span id="fr_2622"></span>[2623](#fn_2622.md) He has all things, and
dost thou turn aside the fact that He was sent, to wrong Him?

<span id="iv.iv.vii.viii-p17"></span>94. But if thou dost not accept the
truth of His mission according to the flesh, as the Apostle spoke of
it, <span id="fr_2623"></span>[2624](#fn_2623.md) and dost raise out of a
mere word a decision against it, to enable thee to say that inferiors
are wont to be sent by superiors; what answer wilt thou give to the fact
that the Son was sent to men? For if thou dost think that he who is sent
is inferior to him by whom he is sent, thou must learn also that an
inferior has sent a superior, and that superiors have been sent to
inferiors. For Tobias sent Raphael the archangel, <span
id="fr_2624"></span>[2625](#fn_2624.md) and an angel was sent to
Balaam, <span id="fr_2625"></span>[2626](#fn_2625.md) and the Son of God to
the Jews.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.viii-p21"></span>95. Or was the Son of God inferior
to the Jews to whom He was sent? For of Him it is written: “Last of all
He sent unto them His only Son, saying, They will reverence My
Son.” <span id="fr_2626"></span>[2627](#fn_2626.md) And mark that He
mentioned first the servants, then the Son, that thou mayest know that
God, the only-begotten Son according to the power of His Godhead, has
neither name nor lot in common with servants. He is sent forth to be
reverenced, not to be compared with the household.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.viii-p23"></span>96. And rightly did He add the word
“My,” that we might believe He came, not as one of many, nor as one of a
lower nature or of some inferior power, but as true from Him that is
true, as the Image of the Father’s Substance.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.viii-p24"></span>97. Suppose, however, that he who
is sent is inferior to him by whom he is sent. Christ then was inferior
to Pilate; for Pilate sent Him to Herod. But a word does not prejudice
His power. Scripture, which says that He was sent from the Father, says
that He was sent from a ruler.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.viii-p25"></span>98. Wherefore, if we sensibly hold
to those things which be worthy of the Son of God, we ought to
understand Him to have been sent in such a way that the Word of God, out
of the incomprehensible and ineffable mystery of the depths of His
majesty, gave Himself for comprehension to our minds, so far as we could
lay hold of Him, not only when He “emptied” Himself, but also when He
dwelt in us, as it is written: “I will dwell in them.” <span
id="fr_2627"></span>[2628](#fn_2627.md) Elsewhere also it stands that God
said: “Go to, let us go down and confound their language.” <span
id="fr_2628"></span>[2629](#fn_2628.md) God, indeed, never descends from
any place; for He says: “I fill heaven and earth.” <span
id="fr_2629"></span>[2630](#fn_2629.md) But He seems to descend when the
Word of God enters our hearts, as the prophet has said: “Prepare ye the
way of the Lord, make His paths straight.” <span
id="fr_2630"></span>[2631](#fn_2630.md) We are to do this, so that, as He
Himself promised, He may come together with the Father and make His
abode with us. <span id="fr_2631"></span>[2632](#fn_2631.md) It is clear,
then, how He comes.

[Next: Chapter VIII. Christ, so far as He is true Son of God, has no
Lord, but only so far as He is Man; as is shown by His words in which He
addressed at one time the Father, at another the Lord. How many heresies
are silenced by one verse of Scripture! We must distinguish between the
things that belong to Christ as Son of God or as Son of David. For under
the latter title only must we ascribe it to Him that He was a servant.
Lastly, he points out that many passages cannot be taken except as
referring to the Incarnation.](2100262.md)
