#### <span id="iv.iv.iii.xi-p0.1"></span>Chapter X.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xi-p1"></span>Christ’s eternity being proved from
the Apostle’s teaching, St. Ambrose admonishes us that the Divine
Generation is not to be thought of after the fashion of human
procreation, nor to be too curiously pried into. With the difficulties
thence arising he refuses to deal, saying that whatsoever terms, taken
from our knowledge of body, are used in speaking of this Divine
Generation, must be understood with a spiritual meaning.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xi-p2"></span>62. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.iii.xi-p2.1"></span>Hear</span> now another argument, showing
clearly the eternity of the Son. The Apostle says that God’s Power and
Godhead are eternal, and that Christ is the Power of God—for it is
written that Christ is “the Power of God and the Wisdom of God.” <span
id="fr_1787"></span>[1788](#fn_1787.md) If, then, Christ is the Power of
God, it follows that, forasmuch as God’s Power is eternal, Christ also
is eternal.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xi-p4"></span>63. Thou canst not, then, heretic,
build up a false doctrine from the custom of human procreation, nor yet
gather the wherewithal for such work from our discourse, for we cannot
compass the greatness of infinite Godhead, “of Whose greatness there is
no end,” <span id="fr_1788"></span>[1789](#fn_1788.md) in our straitened
speech. If thou shouldst seek to give an account of a man’s birth, thou
must needs point to a time. But the Divine Generation is above all
things; it reaches far and wide, it rises high above all thought and
feeling. For it is written: “No man cometh to the Father, save by
Me.” <span id="fr_1789"></span>[1790](#fn_1789.md) Whatsoever, therefore,
thou dost conceive concerning the Father—yea, be it even His
eternity—thou canst not conceive aught concerning Him save by the Son’s
aid, nor can any understanding ascend to the Father save through the
Son. “This is My dearly-beloved Son,” <span
id="fr_1790"></span>[1791](#fn_1790.md) the Father saith. “Is” <span
id="page_212">p. 212</span> <span id="iv.iv.iii.xi-Page_212"></span>mark
you—He Who is, what He is, forever. Hence also David is moved to say: “O
Lord, Thy Word abideth for ever in heaven,” <span
id="fr_1791"></span>[1792](#fn_1791.md) —for what abideth fails neither in
existence nor in eternity.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xi-p9"></span>64. Dost thou ask me how He is a Son,
if He have not a Father existing before Him? I ask of thee, in turn,
when, or how, thinkest thou that the Son was begotten. For me the
knowledge of the mystery of His generation is more than I can attain
to, <span id="fr_1792"></span>[1793](#fn_1792.md) —the mind fails, the
voice is dumb—ay, and not mine alone, but the angels’ also. It is above
Powers, above Angels, above Cherubim, Seraphim, and all that has feeling
and thought, for it is written: “The peace of Christ, which passeth all
understanding.” <span id="fr_1793"></span>[1794](#fn_1793.md) If the peace
of Christ passes all understanding, how can so wondrous a generation but
be above all understanding?

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xi-p12"></span>65. Do thou, then (like the angels),
cover thy face with thy hands, <span
id="fr_1794"></span>[1795](#fn_1794.md) for it is not given thee to look
into surpassing mysteries! We are suffered to know that the Son is
begotten, not to dispute upon the manner of His begetting. I cannot deny
the one; the other I fear to search into, for if Paul says that the
words which he heard when caught up into the third heaven might not be
uttered, <span id="fr_1795"></span>[1796](#fn_1795.md) how can we explain
the secret of this generation from and of the Father, which we can
neither hear nor attain to with our understanding?

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xi-p15"></span>66. But if you will constrain me to
the rule of human generation, that you may be allowed to say that the
Father existed before the Son, then consider whether instances, taken
from the generation of earthly creatures, are suitable to show forth the
Divine Generation. <span id="fr_1796"></span>[1797](#fn_1796.md) If we
speak according to what is customary amongst men, you cannot deny that,
in man, the changes in the father’s existence happen before those in the
son’s. The father is the first to grow, to enter old age, to grieve, to
weep. If, then, the son is after him in time, he is older in experience
than the son. If the child comes to be born, the parent escapes not the
shame of begetting. <span id="fr_1797"></span>[1798](#fn_1797.md)

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xi-p18"></span>67. Why take such delight in that
rack of questioning? <span id="fr_1798"></span>[1799](#fn_1798.md) You hear
the name of the Son of God; abolish it, then, or acknowledge His true
nature. You hear speak of the womb—acknowledge the truth of undoubted
begetting. <span id="fr_1799"></span>[1800](#fn_1799.md) Of His heart—know
that here is God’s word. <span id="fr_1800"></span>[1801](#fn_1800.md) Of
His right hand—confess His power. <span
id="fr_1801"></span>[1802](#fn_1801.md) Of His face—acknowledge His
wisdom. <span id="fr_1802"></span>[1803](#fn_1802.md) These words are not
to be understood, when we speak of God, as when we speak of bodies. The
generation of the Son is incomprehensible, the Father begets
impassibly, <span id="fr_1803"></span>[1804](#fn_1803.md) and yet of
Himself and in ages inconceivably remote hath very God begotten very
God. The Father loves the Son, <span
id="fr_1804"></span>[1805](#fn_1804.md) and you anxiously examine His
Person; the Father is well pleased in Him, <span
id="fr_1805"></span>[1806](#fn_1805.md) you, joining the Jews, look upon
Him with an evil eye; the Father knows the Son, <span
id="fr_1806"></span>[1807](#fn_1806.md) and you join the heathen in
reviling Him. <span id="fr_1807"></span>[1808](#fn_1807.md)

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xi-p16"></span> The analogy, as made by the Arians,
certainly was open to St. Ambrose’s censure. We should remember,
however, that a man is not properly a father until his child is born.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xi-p17"></span> St. Ambrose perhaps thought that the
curse laid upon human conception and birth ([Gen. iii.
16](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#016.md)<span
id="iv.iv.iii.xi-p17.1"></span>) displayed itself as well in the initial
as in the final stages.

[Next: Chapter XI. It cannot be proved from Scripture that the Father
existed before the Son, nor yet can arguments taken from human
reproduction avail to this end, since they bring in absurdities without
end. To dare to affirm that Christ began to exist in the course of time
is the height of blasphemy.](2100194.md)
