<span id="iv.i.ii.xxxi"></span>

#### <span id="iv.i.ii.xxxi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXI.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxxi-p1"></span>A kindness received should be returned
with a freer hand. This is shown by the example of the earth. A passage
from Solomon about feasting is adduced to prove the same, and is
expounded later in a spiritual sense.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxxi-p2"></span>160. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.ii.xxxi-p2.1"></span>It</span> is also right <span
id="fr_232"></span>[233](#fn_232.md) that more regard should be paid to him
who has conferred some benefit or gift upon thee, if he ever is reduced
to want. For what is so contrary to one’s duty as not to return what one
has received? Nor do I think that a return of equal value should be
made, but a greater. One ought to make up for the enjoyment of a
kindness one has received from another, to such an extent as to help
that person, even to putting an end to his needs. For not to be the
better in returning than in conferring a kindness, is to be the
inferior; for he who was the first to give was the first in point of
time, and also first in showing a kind disposition.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxxi-p4"></span>161. Wherefore we must imitate the
nature of the earth <span id="fr_233"></span>[234](#fn_233.md) in this
respect, which is wont to return the seed she has received, multiplied a
thousand-fold. And so it is written: “As a field is the foolish man, and
as a vineyard is the man without sense. If thou leavest him, he will be
made desolate.” <span id="fr_234"></span>[235](#fn_234.md) As a field also
is the wise man, so as to return the seed given him in fuller measure,
as though it had been lent to him on interest. The earth either produces
fruits of its own accord, or pays back and restores, what it was
entrusted with, in fruitful abundance. In both these ways a return is
due from thee, when thou enterest upon the use of thy father’s
possession, that thou mayest not be left to lie as an unfruitful field.
It may be that a man can make an excuse for not giving anything, but how
can he excuse himself for not returning what was given? It is hardly
right not to give anything; it is certainly not right to make no return
for kindness done to oneself. <span id="fr_235"></span>[236](#fn_235.md)

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxxi-p8"></span>162. Therefore Solomon says well:
“When thou sittest to eat at the table of a ruler consider diligently
what is before thee, and put forth thine hand, knowing that it behoves
thee to make such preparations. But if thou art insatiable, be not
desirous of his dainties, for they have but a deceptive life.” <span
id="fr_236"></span>[237](#fn_236.md) I have written these words as I wish
that we all should follow them. It is a good thing to do a service, but
he who knows not how to return one is very hard. The earth herself
supplies an example of kindliness. She provides fruits of her own
accord, which thou didst not sow; she also returns many-fold what she
has received. It is not right for thee to deny knowledge of money paid
in to thee, and how can it be right to let a service done go without
notice? In the book of Proverbs also it is said: that the <span
id="page_28">p. 28</span> <span
id="iv.i.ii.xxxi-Page_28"></span>repayment of kindness has such great
power with God, that through it, even in the day of destruction, a man
may find grace, though his sins outweigh all else. <span
id="fr_237"></span>[238](#fn_237.md) And why need I bring forward other
examples when the Lord Himself promises in the Gospel a fuller reward to
the merits of the saints, and exhorts us to do good works, saying:
“Forgive, and ye shall be forgiven; give, and it shall be given unto
you; good measure, shaken together and running over, shall men give into
your bosom.” <span id="fr_238"></span>[239](#fn_238.md)

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxxi-p12"></span>163. But the feasting that Solomon
speaks of has not to do with common food only, but it is to be
understood as having to do with good works. For how can the soul be
feasted in better wise than on good works; or what can so easily fill
the mind of the just as the knowledge of a good work done? What
pleasanter food is there than to do the will of God? The Lord has told
us that He had this food alone in abundance, as it is written in the
Gospel, saying: “My food is to do the will of My Father which is in
heaven.” <span id="fr_239"></span>[240](#fn_239.md)

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxxi-p14"></span>164. In this food let us delight of
which the prophet says: “Delight thou in the Lord.” <span
id="fr_240"></span>[241](#fn_240.md) In this food they delight, who have
with wonderful knowledge learnt to take in the higher delights; who can
know what that delight is which is pure and which can be understood by
the mind. Let us therefore eat the bread of wisdom, and let us be filled
with the word of God. For the life of man made in the image of God
consists not in bread alone, but in every word that cometh from
God. <span id="fr_241"></span>[242](#fn_241.md) About the cup, too, holy
Job says, plainly enough: “As the earth waiteth for the rain, so did
they for my words.” <span id="fr_242"></span>[243](#fn_242.md)
