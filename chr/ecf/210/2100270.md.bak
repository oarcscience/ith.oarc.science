#### <span id="iv.iv.vii.xvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVI.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xvii-p1"></span>The Arians are condemned by the Holy
Spirit through the mouth of David: for they dare to limit Christ’s
knowledge. The passage cited by them in proof of this is by no means
free from suspicion of having been corrupted. But to set this right, we
must mark the word “Son.” For knowledge cannot fail Christ as Son of
God, since He is Wisdom; nor the recognition of any part, for He created
all things. It is not possible that He, who made the ages, cannot know
the future, much less the day of judgment. Such knowledge, whether it
concerns anything great or small, may not be denied to the Son, nor yet
to the Holy Spirit. Lastly, various proofs are given from which we can
gather that this knowledge exists in Christ.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xvii-p2"></span>188. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.vii.xvii-p2.1"></span>Wherefore</span> we ought to know that
they who make such statements are accursed and condemned by the Holy
Spirit. For whom else but the Arians in chief does the prophet condemn,
seeing that they say that the Son of God knows neither times nor years.
For there is nothing which God is ignorant of; and Christ, yea the most
high Christ, is God, for He is “God over all.” <span
id="fr_2765"></span>[2766](#fn_2765.md)

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xvii-p4"></span>189. See how horrified holy David is
at such men, in limiting the knowledge of the Son of God. For thus it is
written: “They are not in the troubles of other men, neither will they
be scourged with men; therefore their pride has laid hold on them; they
are covered with their wickedness and blasphemy; their iniquity hath
stood forth as it were with fatness; they have passed on to the thoughts
of their heart.” <span id="fr_2766"></span>[2767](#fn_2766.md) Truly he
condemns those who think that divine things are to be regarded in the
light of the thoughts of the heart. For God is not subject to
arrangement or order; seeing that we do not perceive even those very
things, which are common among men and often occur in the history of the
human race, to turn out always after the arrangement of some stated
rule, but often to happen suddenly in some secret and mysterious manner.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xvii-p6"></span>190. “They have thought,” he says,
“and have spoken wickedness. They have spoken wickedness against the
Most High. They have set their mouth against heaven.” <span
id="fr_2767"></span>[2768](#fn_2767.md) We see then that he condemns, as
guilty of wicked blasphemy, those who claim for themselves the right to
arrange the heavenly secrets after the semblance of our human nature.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xvii-p8"></span>191. And they have said: “How hath
God known? And is there knowledge in the Most High?” <span
id="fr_2768"></span>[2769](#fn_2768.md) Do not the Arians echo this daily,
saying that all knowledge cannot exist in Christ? For He, they say,
stated that He knew not the day nor hour. Do they not say, how did He
know, while they maintain that He could not know anything but what He
heard and saw, and apply by a blasphemous interpretation that which
concerns the unity of the divine Nature to weaken His power?

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xvii-p10"></span>192. It is written, they say: “But
of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels which are
in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father only.” <span
id="fr_2769"></span>[2770](#fn_2769.md) First of all the ancient Greek
manuscripts do not contain the words, “neither the Son.” But it is not
to be wondered at if they who have corrupted the sacred Scriptures, have
also falsified this passage. The reason for which it seems to have been
inserted is perfectly plain, so long as it is applied to unfold such
blasphemy.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xvii-p12"></span>193. Suppose however that the
Evangelist wrote thus. The name of “Son” embraces both natures. For He
is also called Son of Man, so that in the ignorance attached to the
assumption of our nature, He seems not to have known the day of the
judgment to come. For how could the Son <span id="page_309">p.
309</span> <span id="iv.iv.vii.xvii-Page_309"></span>of God be ignorant
of the day, seeing that the treasures of the wisdom and knowledge of God
are hidden in Him? <span id="fr_2770"></span>[2771](#fn_2770.md)

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xvii-p14"></span>194. I ask then, whether He had
this knowledge by reason of His Being, or by chance? For all knowledge
comes to us either through nature, or by learning. It is supplied by
nature, as for instance to a horse to enable it to run, or to a fish to
enable it to swim. For they do this without learning. On the other hand,
it is by learning that a man is enabled to swim. For he could not do so
unless he had learnt. Since therefore nature enables dumb animals to do
and to know what they have not learnt, why shouldst thou give an opinion
on the Son of God, and say whether He has knowledge by instruction or by
nature? If by instruction, then He was not begotten as Wisdom, and
gradually began to be perfect, but was not always so. But if He has
knowledge by nature, then He was perfect in the beginning, He came forth
perfect from the Father; and so needed no foreknowledge of the future.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xvii-p15"></span>195. He therefore was not ignorant
of the days; for it does not fall to the lot of the Wisdom of God to
know in part and in part to be ignorant. For how can He who made all
things be ignorant of a part, since it is a less thing to know than to
make. For we know many things which we cannot make, neither do we all
know things in the same way but we know them in part. For a countryman
knows the force of the wind and the courses of the stars in one way—the
inhabitant of a city knows them in another way—and a pilot in yet a
third way. But although all do not know all things, they are said to
know them; but He alone knows all things in full, Who made all things.
The pilot knows for how many watches Arcturus continues, what sort of a
rising of Orion he will discover, but he knows nothing of the connection
of the Vergiliæ and of the other stars, or of their number or names, as
does He “Who numbers the multitude of stars, and calleth them all by
their names;” <span id="fr_2771"></span>[2772](#fn_2771.md) Whom indeed the
power of His work cannot escape.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xvii-p17"></span>196. How then do you wish the Son
of God to have made these things? Like a signet ring which does not feel
the impression it makes? But the Father made all things in wisdom, <span
id="fr_2772"></span>[2773](#fn_2772.md) that is, He made all things through
the Son, who is the Virtue and Wisdom of God. <span
id="fr_2773"></span>[2774](#fn_2773.md) But it befits such Wisdom as that
to know both the powers and the causes of His own works. Thus the
Creator of all things could not be ignorant of what He did—or be without
knowledge of what He had Himself given. Therefore He knew the day which
He made.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xvii-p20"></span>197. But thou sayest that He knows
the present and does not know the future. Though this is a foolish
suggestion, yet that I may satisfy thee on Scriptural grounds, learn
that He made not only what is past, but also what is future, as it is
written: “Who made things to come.” <span
id="fr_2774"></span>[2775](#fn_2774.md) Elsewhere too Scripture says: “By
whom also He made the ages, who is the brightness of His glory and the
express Image of His Person.” <span id="fr_2775"></span>[2776](#fn_2775.md)
Now the ages are past and present and future. How then were those made
which are future, unless it is that His active power and knowledge
contains within itself the number of all the ages? For just as He calls
the things that are not as though they were, <span
id="fr_2776"></span>[2777](#fn_2776.md) so has He made things future as
though they were. It cannot come to pass that they should not be. Those
things which He has directed to be, necessarily will be. Therefore He
who has made the things that are to be, knows them in the way in which
they will be.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xvii-p24"></span>198. If we are to believe this
about the ages, much more must we believe it about the day of judgment,
on the ground that the Son of God has knowledge of it, as being already
made by Him. For it is written: “According to Thine ordinance the day
will continue.” <span id="fr_2777"></span>[2778](#fn_2777.md) He did not
merely say “the day continues,” but even “will continue,” so that the
things which are to come might be governed by His ordinance. Does He not
know what He ordered? “He who planted the ear, shall He not hear? He
that formed the eye shall He not see?” <span
id="fr_2778"></span>[2779](#fn_2778.md)

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xvii-p27"></span>199. Let us however see if by
chance there may be some great thing, which could be beyond the
knowledge of its Creator; or at least let them choose whether they will
think of something great and superior to other things, or something very
little and mean. If it is very little and mean, it is no loss, to speak
after our fashion, to know nothing of worthless and petty things. For as
it is a sign of power to know the greatest things, it seems rather to be
a sign of inferior work to look upon what is worth less. Thus He is
freed from fastidiousness, yet is not deprived of His power.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xvii-p28"></span>200. But if they think it a great
and im<span id="page_310">p. 310</span> <span
id="iv.iv.vii.xvii-Page_310"></span>portant thing to know the day of
judgment: Let them say what is greater or better than God the Father. He
knows God the Father, as He Himself says: “No man knoweth the Father but
the Son and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal Him.” <span
id="fr_2779"></span>[2780](#fn_2779.md) I say, does He know the Father and
yet not know the day? So then ye believe that He reveals the Father, and
yet cannot reveal the day?

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xvii-p30"></span>201. Next because you make certain
grades, so as to put the Father before the Son, and the Son before the
Holy Spirit, tell me whether the Holy Spirit knew the day of judgment.
For no thing is written of Him in this place. You deny it entirely. But
what if I show you He knew it? For it is written: “But God hath revealed
them to us by His Spirit, for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea the
deep things of God.” <span id="fr_2780"></span>[2781](#fn_2780.md)
Wherefore, because He searches the deep things of God, since God knows
the day of judgment, the Spirit also knows it. For He knows all that God
knows, as also the Apostle states, saying: “For what man knoweth the
things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him, even so the
things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.” <span
id="fr_2781"></span>[2782](#fn_2781.md) Take heed therefore lest either by
denying that the Holy Spirit knows, you should deny that the Father
knows; (For the things of God, the Spirit of God also knows, but the
things which the Spirit of God does not know, are not the things of
God). Or by confessing that the Spirit of God knows, what you deny that
the Son of God knows, you should put the Spirit before the Son in
opposition to your own declaration. But to hesitate on this point is not
only blasphemous but also foolish.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xvii-p33"></span>202. Now consider how knowledge is
acquired, and let us show that the Son Himself proved that He knew the
day. For what we know we make clear either by mention of time or place
or signs or persons, or by giving their order. How then did He not know
the day of judgment Who described both the hour and the place of
judgment, and the signs and the cases?

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xvii-p34"></span>203. And so thou hast it: “In that
hour he which shall be on the housetop let him not come down to take his
goods out of his house, and he that is in the field, let him likewise
not return back.” <span id="fr_2782"></span>[2783](#fn_2782.md) To such a
point in the future did He know the issues of dangers, that He even
showed the means of safety to those in danger.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xvii-p36"></span>204. Could the Lord be ignorant of
a day Who Himself said of Himself that the Son of Man is Lord of the
Sabbath? <span id="fr_2783"></span>[2784](#fn_2783.md)

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xvii-p38"></span>205. He has also elsewhere marked
out a place, when He said to His disciples who were showing Him the
building of the temple, “Do ye see all these things? Verily I say unto
you, there shall not be left one stone upon another which shall not be
thrown down.” <span id="fr_2784"></span>[2785](#fn_2784.md)

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xvii-p40"></span>206. When questioned also about a
sign by His disciples, He answered: “Take heed that ye be not deceived.
For many shall come in My name, saying I am Christ;” <span
id="fr_2785"></span>[2786](#fn_2785.md) and further on He says: “and great
earthquakes shall be in divers places, and famines, and pestilences, and
terrors from heaven, and there shall be great signs.” <span
id="fr_2786"></span>[2787](#fn_2786.md) Thus He has described both persons
and signs.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xvii-p43"></span>207. In what manner He tells that
the armies will surround Jerusalem, or that the times of the Gentiles
are to be fulfilled, and in what order,—all this is disclosed to us by
the witness of the Gospel words. Therefore He knew all things.

[Next: Chapter XVII. Christ acted for our advantage in being unwilling
to reveal the day of judgment. This is made plain by other words of our
Lord and by a not dissimilar passage from Paul's writings. Other
passages in which the same ignorance seems to be attributed to the
Father are brought forward to meet those who are anxious to know why
Christ answered His disciples, as though He did not know. From these
Ambrose argues against them that if they admit ignorance and inability
in the Father, they must admit that the same Substance exists in the Son
as in the Father; unless they prefer to accuse the Son of falsehood;
since it belongs neither to Him nor to the Father to deceive, but the
unity of both is pointed out in the passage named.](2100271.md)
