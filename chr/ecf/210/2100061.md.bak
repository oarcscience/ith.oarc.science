#### <span id="iv.i.ii.xlix-p0.1"></span>Chapter XLIX.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xlix-p1"></span>We must reserve the likeness of the
virtues in ourselves. The likeness of the devil and of vice must be got
rid of, and especially that of avarice; for this deprives us of liberty,
and despoils those who are in the midst of vanities of the image of God.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xlix-p2"></span>249. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.ii.xlix-p2.1"></span>Whilst</span>, then, we are here let us
preserve the likeness, that there we may attain to the truth. Let the
likeness of justice exist in us, likewise that of wisdom, for we shall
come to that day and shall be rewarded according to our likeness.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xlix-p3"></span>250. Let not the adversary find his
image in thee, let him not find fury nor rage; for in these exists the
likeness of wickedness. “Our adversary the devil as a roaring lion
seeketh whom he may kill, whom he may devour.” <span
id="fr_342"></span>[343](#fn_342.md) Let him not find desire for gold, nor
heaps of money, nor the appearance of vices, lest he take from thee the
voice of liberty. For the voice of true liberty is heard, when thou
canst say: “The prince of this world shall come, and shall find no part
in me.” <span id="fr_343"></span>[344](#fn_343.md) Therefore, if thou art
sure that he will find nothing in thee, when he comes to search through
thee, thou wilt say, as the patriarch Jacob did to Laban: “Know now if
there is aught of thine with me.” <span
id="fr_344"></span>[345](#fn_344.md) Rightly do we account Jacob blessed
with whom Laban could find naught of his. For Rachel had hidden the gold
and silver images of his gods.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xlix-p7"></span>251. If, then, wisdom, and faith, and
contempt of the world, and spiritual grace, exclude all faithlessness,
thou wilt be blessed; for thou regardest not vanity and folly and lying.
Is it a light thing to take away from thy adversary the opportunity to
speak, so that he can have no ground to make his complaint against thee?
Thus he who looks not on vanity is not perturbed; but he who looks upon
it is perturbed, and that, too, all to no purpose. Is it not a vain
thing to heap up riches? for surely to seek for fleeting things is vain
enough. And when thou hast gathered them, how dost thou know that thou
shalt have them in possession?

<span id="iv.i.ii.xlix-p8"></span>252. Is it not vain for a merchant to
journey by night and by day, that he may be able to heap up treasures?
Is it not vain for him to gather merchandise, and to be much perturbed
about its price, for fear he might sell it for less than he gave? that
he should strive everywhere for high prices, and thus unexpectedly call
up robbers against himself through their envy at his much-vaunted
business; or that, without waiting for calmer winds, impatient of
delays, he should meet with shipwreck whilst seeking for gain?

<span id="iv.i.ii.xlix-p9"></span>253. And is not he, too, perturbed in
vain who with great toil amasses wealth, though he knows not what heir
to leave it to? Often and often all that an avaricious man has got
together with the greatest care, his spendthrift heir scatters abroad
with headlong prodigality. The shameless prodigal, blind to the present,
heedless of the future, swallows up as in an abyss what took so long to
gather. Often, too, the desired successor gains but envy for his share
of the inheritance, and by his sudden death hands over the whole amount
of the succession, which he has hardly entered upon, to strangers.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xlix-p10"></span>254. Why, then, dost thou idly spin a
web which is worthless and fruitless? And why dost thou build up useless
heaps of treasures like spiders’ webs? For though they overflow, they
are no good; nay, they denude thee of the likeness of God, and put on
thee the likeness of the earthy. If any one has the likeness of the
tyrant, is he not liable to condemnation? Thou layest aside the likeness
of the Eternal King, and raisest in thyself the image of death. Rather
cast out of the kingdom of thy soul the likeness of the devil, and raise
up the likeness of Christ. Let this shine forth in thee; let this glow
brightly in thy kingdom, that is, thy soul, for it destroys the likeness
of all vices. David says of this: “O Lord, in Thy kingdom thou bringest
their images to nothing.” <span id="fr_345"></span>[346](#fn_345.md) <span
id="page_41">p. 41</span> <span id="iv.i.ii.xlix-Page_41"></span>For
when the Lord has adorned Jerusalem according to His own likeness, then
every likeness of the adversary is destroyed.

[Next: Chapter L. The Levites ought to be utterly free from all earthly
desires. What their virtues should be on the Apostle's own showing, and
how great their purity must be. Also what their dignity and duty is, for
the carrying out of which the chief virtues are necessary. He states
that these were not unknown to the philosophers, but that they erred in
their order. Some are by their nature in accordance with duty, which yet
on account of what accompanies them become contrary to duty. From whence
he gathers what gifts the office of the Levites demands. To conclude, he
adds an exposition of Moses' words when blessing the tribe of
Levi.](2100062.md)
