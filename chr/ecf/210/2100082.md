#### <span id="iv.i.iii.xix-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIX.

<span id="iv.i.iii.xix-p1"></span>Many are won by justice and
benevolence and courtesy, but all this must be sincere.

<span id="iv.i.iii.xix-p2"></span>95. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.iii.xix-p2.1"></span>It</span> is plain, then, that equity
strengthens empires, and injustice destroys them. How could wickedness
hold fast a kingdom when it cannot even rule over a single family? There
is need, therefore, of the greatest kindness, so that we may preserve
not only the government of affairs in general, but also the rights of
individuals. Benevolence is of the greatest value; for it seeks to
embrace all in its favours, to bind them to itself by fulfilling duties,
and to pledge them to itself by its charm.

<span id="iv.i.iii.xix-p3"></span>96. We have also said that courtesy of
speech has great effect in winning favour. But we want it to be sincere
and sensible, without flattery, lest flattery should disgrace the
simplicity and purity of our address. We ought to be a pattern to others
not only in act but also in word, in purity, and in faith. What we wish
to be thought, such let us be; <span id="fr_515"></span>[516](#fn_515.md)
and let us show openly such feelings as we have within us. Let us not
say an unjust word in our heart that we think can be hid in silence, for
He hears things said in secret Who made things secret, and knows the
secrets of the heart, and has implanted feelings within. Therefore as
though under the eyes of the Judge let us consider all we do as set
forth in the light, that it may be manifest to all.

[Next: Chapter XX. Familiarity with good men is very advantageous to
all, especially to the young, as is shown by the example of Joshua and
Moses and others. Further, those who are unlike in age are often alike
in virtues, as Peter and John prove.](2100083.md)
