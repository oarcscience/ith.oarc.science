#### <span id="iv.vi.iii.x-p0.1"></span>Chapter X.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.x-p1"></span>In order to do away with the feeling of
shame which holds back the guilty from public penance, St. Ambrose
points out the advantage of prayers offered by the whole Church, and
sets forth the example of saints who have sorrowed. Then, after
reproving those who imagine that penance may be often repeated, he
points out the difficulty of repentance, and how it is to be carried
out.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.x-p2"></span>91. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.iii.x-p2.1"></span>Can</span> any one endure that you should
blush to entreat God, when you do not blush to entreat a man? That you
should be ashamed to entreat Him Who knows you fully, when you are not
ashamed to confess your sins to a man who knows you not? <span
id="fr_3138"></span>[3139](#fn_3138.md) Do you shrink from witnesses and
sympathizers in your prayers, when, if you have to satisfy a man, you
must visit many and entreat them to be kind enough to intervene; when
you throw yourself at a man’s knees, kiss his feet, bring your children,
still unconscious of guilt, to entreat also for their father’s pardon?
And you disdain to do this in the Church in order to entreat God, in
order to gain for yourself the support of the holy congregation; where
there is no cause for shame, except indeed not to confess, since we are
all sinners, amongst whom he is the most praiseworthy who is the most
humble; he is the most just who feels himself the lowest.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.x-p4"></span>92. Let the Church, our Mother, weep
for <span id="page_357">p. 357</span> <span
id="iv.vi.iii.x-Page_357"></span>you, and wash away your guilt with her
tears; let Christ see you mourning and say, “Blessed are ye that are
sad, for ye shall rejoice.” It pleases Him that many should entreat for
one. In the Gospel, too, moved by the widow’s tears, because many were
weeping for her, He raised her son. He heard Peter more quickly when He
raised Dorcas, because the poor were mourning over the death of the
woman. He also forthwith forgave Peter, for he wept most bitterly. And
if you weep bitterly Christ will look upon you and your guilt shall
leave you. For the application of pain does away with the enjoyment of
the wickedness and the delight of the sin. And so while mourning over
our past sins we shut the door against fresh ones, and from the
condemnation of our guilt there arises as it were a training in
innocence.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.x-p5"></span>93. Let, then, nothing call you away
from penitence, for this you have in common with the saints, and would
that such sorrowing for sin as that of the saints were copied by you.
David, as it were, “ate ashes for bread, and mingled his drink with
weeping,” <span id="fr_3139"></span>[3140](#fn_3139.md) and therefore now
rejoices the more because he wept the more: “Mine eyes ran down,” he
said, “with rivers of water.” <span id="fr_3140"></span>[3141](#fn_3140.md)

<span id="iv.vi.iii.x-p8"></span>94. John wept sore, <span
id="fr_3141"></span>[3142](#fn_3141.md) and, as he tells us, the mysteries
of Christ were revealed to him. But that woman who, when she was in sin
and ought to have wept, nevertheless rejoiced, and covered herself with
a robe of purple and scarlet, <span id="fr_3142"></span>[3143](#fn_3142.md)
and adorned herself with much gold and precious stones, now mourns the
misery of eternal weeping.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.x-p11"></span>95. Deservedly are they blamed who
think that they often do penance, for they are wanton against Christ.
For if they went through their penance in truth, they would not think
that it could be repeated again; for as there is but one baptism, so
there is but one course of penance, so far as the outward practice goes,
for we must repent of our daily faults, but this latter has to do with
lighter faults, the former with such as are graver.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.x-p12"></span>96. But I have more easily found such
as had preserved their innocence than such as had fittingly repented.
Does any one think that that is penitence where there still exists the
striving after earthly honours, where wine flows, and even conjugal
connection takes place? The world must be renounced; less sleep must be
indulged in than nature demands; it must be broken by groans,
interrupted by sighs, put aside by prayers; the mode of life must be
such that we die to the usual habits of life. Let the man deny himself
and be wholly changed, as in the fable they relate of a certain youth,
who left his home because of his love for a harlot, and, having subdued
his love, returned; then one day meeting his old favourite and not
speaking to her, she, being surprised and supposing that he had not
recognized her, said, when they met again, “It is I.” “But,” was his
answer, “I am not the former I.”

<span id="iv.vi.iii.x-p13"></span>97. Well then did the Lord say: “If
any man will come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross
and follow Me.” <span id="fr_3143"></span>[3144](#fn_3143.md) For they who
are dead and buried in Christ ought not again to make their conclusions
as though living in the world. “Touch not,” it is said, “nor attend to
those things which tend to corruption by their very use, <span
id="fr_3144"></span>[3145](#fn_3144.md) for the very customs of this life
corrupt integrity.”

<span id="iv.vi.iii.x-p3"></span> A good deal of controversy has arisen
about this passage, which certainly appears, *prima facie,* to contrast
confession to God and to a man obviously priest or bishop. The
Benedictine editors insist much upon the use of the singular number,
*homini,* a man. But the word might conceivably be used in a general
sense. There is no real doubt as to the practice of the Early Church.
See note at the end of this treatise.

id="iv.vi.iii.x-p15.1"></span>. We have here an instance of a very
extreme kind, of the way in which St. Ambrose and other writers
occasionally quote the words of holy Scripture without reference to
their context or real meaning. The words suit the argument of St.
Ambrose and he uses them. But they mean almost the very opposite in the
original. They are part of the argument which St. Paul is opposing, not
his argument.

[Next: Chapter XI. The possibility of repentance is a reason why baptism
should not be deferred to old age, a practice which is against the will
of God in holy Scripture. But it is of no use to practise penance whilst
still serving lusts. These must be first subdued.](2100316.md)
