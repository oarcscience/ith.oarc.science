#### <span id="iv.iv.v.viii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VIII.

<span id="iv.iv.v.viii-p1"></span>The prophecy of Christ’s Godhead and
Manhood, contained in the verse of Isaiah just now cited, is unfolded,
and its force in refuting various heresies demonstrated.

<span id="iv.iv.v.viii-p2"></span>54. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.v.viii-p2.1"></span>This</span> beginning did Isaiah see, and
therefore he says: “A Child is born, a Son is given to us,” as also did
the Magi, and therefore worshipped they, when they saw the little One in
the stable, and said: “A Child is born,” and, when they saw the star,
declared, “A Son is given to us.” On the one hand, a gift from earth—on
the other, a gift from heaven—and both are One Person, perfect in
respect of each, without any changeableness in the Godhead, as without
any taking away from the fulness of the Manhood. One Person did the Magi
adore, to one and the same they offered their gifts, to show that He Who
was seen in the stall was the very Lord of heaven.

<span id="iv.iv.v.viii-p3"></span>55. Mark how the two verbs differ in
their import: “A Child is born, a Son is given.” Though born of the
Father, yet is He not born, but given to us, forasmuch as the Son is not
for our sakes, but we for the Son’s. For indeed He was not born to us,
being born before us, and the maker of all things created: nor is He now
brought to life for the first time, Who was always, and was in the
beginning; <span id="fr_2213"></span>[2214](#fn_2213.md) on the other hand,
that which before-time was not is born to us. Again we find it thus
recorded, how that the angel, when he spoke to the shepherds, said that
He had been born: “Who is this day born to us a Saviour, Who is Christ
the Lord, in the city of David.” <span
id="fr_2214"></span>[2215](#fn_2214.md) To us, then, was born that which
was not before—that is, a child of the Virgin, a body from Mary—for this
was made after man had been created, whereas \[the Godhead\] was before
us.

<span id="iv.iv.v.viii-p6"></span>56. Some manuscripts read as follows:
“A Child is born to us a Son is given to us;” <span
id="fr_2215"></span>[2216](#fn_2215.md) that is to say, He, Who is Son of
God, is born as Mary’s child for us, and given to us. As for the fact
that He is “given,” listen to the prophet’s words: “And grant us Thy
salvation.” <span id="fr_2216"></span>[2217](#fn_2216.md) But that which is
above <span id="page_251">p. 251</span> <span
id="iv.iv.v.viii-Page_251"></span>us is given: what is from heaven is
given: even as indeed we read concerning the Spirit, that “the love of
God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit, Who is given unto
us.” <span id="fr_2217"></span>[2218](#fn_2217.md)

<span id="iv.iv.v.viii-p10"></span>57. But note how this passage is as
water upon fire to a crowd of heresies. “A Child is born to *us*,” not
to the Jews; “to *us*,” not to the Manichæans; “to *us*,” not to the
Marcionites. The prophet says “to *us*,” that is, to those who believe,
not to unbelievers. And He indeed, in His pitifulness, was born for all,
but it is the disloyalty of heretics that hath brought it to pass that
the birth of Him Who was born for all should not profit all. For the sun
is bidden to rise upon the good and the bad, but to them that see not
there is no appearance of sunrise.

<span id="iv.iv.v.viii-p11"></span>58. Even as the Child, then, is born
not unto all, but unto the faithful: so the Son is given to the faithful
and not to the unbelieving. He is given to us, not to the Photinians;
for they affirm that the Son of God was not given unto us, but was born
and first began to exist amongst us. To us is He given, not to the
Sabellians, who will not hear of a Son being given, maintaining that
Father and Son are one and the same. Unto us is He given, not unto the
Arians, in whose judgment the Son was not given for salvation, but sent
over subject and inferior, to whom, moreover, He is no “Counsellor,”
inasmuch as they hold that He knows nought of the future, no Son, since
they believe not in His eternity, though of the Word of God it is
written: “That which was in the beginning;” and again: “In the beginning
was the Word.” <span id="fr_2218"></span>[2219](#fn_2218.md) To return to
the passage we set before us to discuss. “In the beginning,” saith the
Scripture, “before He made the earth, before He made the deeps, before
He brought forth the springs of water, before all the hills He begat
Me.” <span id="fr_2219"></span>[2220](#fn_2219.md)
