#### <span id="iv.vii.ii.ix-p0.1"></span>Chapter IX.

<span id="iv.vii.ii.ix-p1"></span>Other passages from the Song of Songs
are considered with relation to the present subject, and St. Ambrose
exhorting the virgin to seek for Christ, points out where He may be
found. A description of His perfections follows, and a comparison is
made between virgins and the angels.

<span id="iv.vii.ii.ix-p2"></span>44. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vii.ii.ix-p2.1"></span>Take</span>, then, O Virgin, the wings of
the Spirit, that you may fly far above all vices, if you wish to attain
to Christ: “He dwelleth on high, but beholdeth lowly things;” <span
id="fr_3201"></span>[3202](#fn_3201.md) and His appearance is as that of a
cedar of Lebanon, which has its foliage in the clouds, its roots in the
earth. For its beginning is from heaven, its ending on earth, and it
produces fruit very close to heaven. Search diligently for so precious a
flower, if perchance you may find it in the recesses of your breast, for
it is most often to be enjoyed in lowly places.

<span id="iv.vii.ii.ix-p4"></span>45. It loves to grow in gardens, in
which Susanna, while walking, found it, and was ready to die rather than
it should be violated. But what is meant by the gardens He Himself
points out, saying: “A garden enclosed is My sister, My spouse, a garden
enclosed, a fountain sealed;” <span id="fr_3202"></span>[3203](#fn_3202.md)
because in gardens of this kind the water of the pure fountain shines,
reflecting the features of the image of God, lest its streams mingled
with mud from the wallowing places of spiritual wild beasts should be
polluted. For this reason, too, that modesty of virgins fenced in by the
wall of the Spirit is enclosed lest it should lie open to be plundered.
And so as a garden inaccessible from without smells of the violet, is
scented with the olive, and is resplendent with the rose, that religion
may increase in the vine, peace in the olive, and the modesty of
consecrated virginity in the rose. This is the odour of which the
patriarch Jacob smelt when he heard his father say: “See the smell of my
son is as the smell of a field which is full.” <span
id="fr_3203"></span>[3204](#fn_3203.md) For although the field of the holy
patriarch was full of almost all fruits, the other brought forth its
crops with greater labour, the latter flowers.

<span id="iv.vii.ii.ix-p7"></span>46. To work, then, O Virgin, and if
you wish your garden to be sweet after this sort, enclose it with the
precepts of the prophets: “Set a watch before thy mouth, and a door to
thy lips,” <span id="fr_3204"></span>[3205](#fn_3204.md) that you, too, may
be able to say: “As the apple-tree among the trees of the wood, so is my
Beloved among the sons. In His shadow I delighted and sat down, and His
fruit was sweet to my palate. <span id="fr_3205"></span>[3206](#fn_3205.md)
I found Him Whom my soul loved, I held Him and would not let him go. My
beloved came down into His garden to eat the fruit of His trees. <span
id="fr_3206"></span>[3207](#fn_3206.md) Come, my Beloved, let us go forth
into the field. <span id="fr_3207"></span>[3208](#fn_3207.md) Set me as a
signet upon Thine heart, and as a seal upon Thine arm. <span
id="fr_3208"></span>[3209](#fn_3208.md) My Beloved is white and
ruddy.” <span id="fr_3209"></span>[3210](#fn_3209.md) For it is fitting, O
Virgin, that you should fully know Him Whom you love, and should
recognize in Him all the mystery of His Divine Nature and the Body which
He has assumed. He is white fittingly, for He is the brightness of the
Father; and ruddy, for He was born of a Virgin. The colour of each
nature shines and glows in Him. But remember that the marks of His
Godhead are more ancient in Him than the mysteries of His body, for He
did not take His origin from the Virgin, but, He Who already existed
came into the Virgin.

<span id="iv.vii.ii.ix-p14"></span>47. He Who was spoiled by the
soldiers, Who was wounded by the spear, that He might heal us by the
blood of His sacred wounds, will assuredly answer you (for He is meek
and lowly of heart, and gentle in aspect): “Arise, O north wind, and
come, O south, and blow upon My garden, that My spices may flow
out.” <span id="fr_3210"></span>[3211](#fn_3210.md) For from all parts of
the world has the perfume of holy religion increased, and the limbs of
the consecrated Virgin have glowed. “Thou art beautiful, O my love, as
Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem.” <span id="fr_3211"></span>[3212](#fn_3211.md)
So it is not the beauty of the perishable body, which will come to an
end with sickness or old age, but the reputation for good deserts,
subject to no accidents and never to perish, which is the beauty of
virgins.

<span id="iv.vii.ii.ix-p17"></span>48. And since you are worthy to be
compared not now with men but with heavenly beings, whose life you are
living on earth, receive from the Lord the precepts you are to observe:
“Set Me as a signet upon thine heart, and as a seal upon thine
arm;” <span id="fr_3212"></span>[3213](#fn_3212.md) that clearer proofs of
your prudence and actions may be set forth, in which Christ the <span
id="page_371">p. 371</span> <span
id="iv.vii.ii.ix-Page_371"></span>Figure of God may shine, Who,
equalling fully the nature of the Father, has expressed the whole which
He took of the Father’s Godhead. Whence also the Apostle Paul says that
we are sealed in the Spirit; <span id="fr_3213"></span>[3214](#fn_3213.md)
since we have in the Son the image of the Father, and in the Spirit the
seal of the Son. Let us, then, sealed by this Trinity, take more
diligent heed, lest either levity of character or the deceit of any
unfaithfulness unseal the pledge which we have received in our hearts.

<span id="iv.vii.ii.ix-p20"></span>49. But let fear secure this for the
holy virgins, for whom the Church first provided such protection, who,
anxious for the prosperity of her tender offspring, herself as a wall
with breasts as many towers, <span id="fr_3214"></span>[3215](#fn_3214.md)
increases her care for them, until, the fear of hostile attack being at
an end, she obtains by the care of a mother’s love peace for her
vigorous children. Wherefore the prophet says: “Peace be on thy virtue,
and abundance in thy towers.” <span id="fr_3215"></span>[3216](#fn_3215.md)

<span id="iv.vii.ii.ix-p23"></span>50. Then the Lord of peace Himself,
after having embraced in His strong arms the vineyards committed to Him,
and beholding their shoots putting forth buds, with glad looks, tempers
the breezes to the young fruits, as Himself testifies, saying: “My
vineyard is in My sight, a thousand for Solomon, and two hundred who
keep the fruit thereof.” <span id="fr_3216"></span>[3217](#fn_3216.md)

<span id="iv.vii.ii.ix-p25"></span>51. Above it is said: “Sixty strong
men round about its offspring, armed with drawn swords, and expert in
warlike discipline,” <span id="fr_3217"></span>[3218](#fn_3217.md) here
there are a thousand and two hundred. The number has increased, where
the fruit has increased, for the more holy each is, the more is he
guarded. So Elisha the prophet showed the hosts of angels who were
present to guard him; so Joshua the son of Nun recognized the Captain of
the heavenly host. They, then, who are able also to fight for us are
able to guard the fruit that is in us. And for you, holy virgins, there
is a special guardianship, for you who with unspotted chastity keep the
couch of the Lord holy. And no wonder if the angels fight for you who
war with the mode of life of angels. Virginal chastity merits their
guardianship whose life it attains to.

<span id="iv.vii.ii.ix-p27"></span>52. Why should I continue the praise
of chastity in more words? For chastity has made even angels. He who has
preserved it is an angel; he who has lost it a devil. And hence has
religion also gained its name. She is a virgin who is the bride of God,
a harlot who makes gods for herself. What shall I say of the
resurrection of which you already hold the rewards: “For in the
resurrection they will neither be given in marriage, nor marry, but
shall be,” He says, “as the angels in heaven.” <span
id="fr_3218"></span>[3219](#fn_3218.md) That which is promised to us is
already present with you, and the object of your prayers is with you; ye
are of this world, and yet not in this world. This age has held you, but
has not been able to retain you.

<span id="iv.vii.ii.ix-p29"></span>53. But what a great thing it is that
angels because of incontinence fell from heaven into this world, that
virgins because of chastity passed from the world into heaven. Blessed
virgins, whom the delights of the flesh do not allure, nor the
defilement of pleasures cast down. Sparing food and abstinence in drink
train them in ignorance of vices, seeing they keep them from knowing the
causes of vices. That which causes sin has often deceived even the just.
In this way the people of God after they sat down to eat and drink
denied God. <span id="fr_3219"></span>[3220](#fn_3219.md) In this way, too,
Lot knew not, and so endured his daughters’ wickedness. <span
id="fr_3220"></span>[3221](#fn_3220.md) So, too, the sons of Noah going
backward covered their father’s nakedness, which he who was wanton saw,
he who was modest blushed at and dutifully hid, fearful of offending if
he too saw it. <span id="fr_3221"></span>[3222](#fn_3221.md) How great is
the power of wine, so that wine made him naked which the waters of the
deluge could not.

[Next: Chapter X. Finally, another glory of virginity is mentioned, that
it is free from avarice. St. Ambrose, addressing his sister, reminds her
of the great happiness of those who are free from those troubles as to
luxury and vanity which come upon those who are about to
marry.](2100330.md)
