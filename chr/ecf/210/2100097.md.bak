<span id="iv.i.iv.iii"></span>

#### <span id="iv.i.iv.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.

<span id="iv.i.iv.iii-p1"></span>The rule given about not seeking one’s
own gain is established, first by the examples of Christ, next by the
meaning of the word, and lastly by the very form and uses of our limbs.
Wherefore the writer shows what a crime it is to deprive another of what
is useful, since the law of nature as well as the divine law is broken
by such wickedness. Further, by its means we also lose that gift which
makes us superior to other living creatures; and lastly, through it
civil laws are abused and treated with the greatest contempt.

<span id="iv.i.iv.iii-p2"></span>15. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.iv.iii-p2.1"></span>If</span>, then, any one wishes to please
all, he must strive in everything to do, not what is useful for himself,
but what is useful for many, as also Paul strove to do. For this is “to
be conformed to the image of Christ,” <span
id="fr_613"></span>[614](#fn_613.md) namely, when one does not strive for
what is another’s, and does not deprive another of something so as to
gain it for <span id="page_70">p. 70</span> <span
id="iv.i.iv.iii-Page_70"></span>oneself. For Christ our Lord, <span
id="fr_614"></span>[615](#fn_614.md) though He was in the form of God,
emptied Himself so as to take on Himself the form of man, which He
wished to enrich with the virtue of His works. Wilt thou, then, spoil
him whom Christ has put on? Wilt thou strip him whom Christ has clothed?
For this is what thou art doing when thou dost attempt to increase thine
own advantage at another’s loss.

<span id="iv.i.iv.iii-p5"></span>16. Think, O man, from whence thou hast
received thy name—even from the earth, <span
id="fr_615"></span>[616](#fn_615.md) which takes nothing from any one, but
gives freely to all, and supplies varied produce for the use of all
living things. Hence humanity is called a particular and innate virtue
in man, for it assists its partner.

<span id="iv.i.iv.iii-p7"></span>17. The very form of thy body and the
uses of thy limbs teach thee this. Can one limb claim the duties of
another? Can the eye claim for itself the duties of the ear; or the
mouth the duties of the eye; or the hand the service of the feet; or the
feet that of the hands? Nay, the hands themselves, both left and right,
have different duties to do, so that if one were to change the use of
either, one would act contrary to nature. We should have to lay aside
the whole man before we could change the service of the various members:
as if, for instance, we were to try to take food with the left hand, or
to perform the duties of the left hand with the right, so as to remove
the remains of food—unless, of course, need demanded it.

<span id="iv.i.iv.iii-p8"></span>18. Imagine for a moment, and give to
the eye the power to withdraw the understanding from the head, the sense
of hearing from the ears, the power of thought from the mind, the sense
of smell from the nose, the sense of taste from the mouth, and then to
assume them itself, would it not at once destroy the whole order of
nature? Wherefore the Apostle says well: “If the whole body were an eye,
where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the
smelling?” <span id="fr_616"></span>[617](#fn_616.md) So, then, we are all
one body, though with many members, all necessary to the body. For no
one member can say of another: “I have no need of thee.” For those
members which seem to be more feeble are much more necessary and require
greater care and attention. And if one member suffers, all the members
suffer with it. <span id="fr_617"></span>[618](#fn_617.md)

<span id="iv.i.iv.iii-p11"></span>19. So we see how grave a matter it is
to deprive another, with whom we ought rather to suffer, of anything, or
to act unfairly or injuriously towards one to whom we ought to give a
share in our services. This is a true law of nature, which binds us to
show all kindly feeling, so that we should all of us in turn help one
another, as parts of one body, and should never think of depriving
another of anything, seeing it is against the law of nature even to
abstain from giving help. We are born in such a way that limb combines
with limb, and one works with another, and all assist each other in
mutual service. But if one fails in its duty, the rest are hindered. If,
for instance, the hand tears out the eye, has it not hindered the use of
its work? If it were to wound the foot, how many actions would it not
prevent? But how much worse is it for the whole man to be drawn aside
from his duty than for one of the members only! If the whole body is
injured in one member, so also is the whole community of the human race
disturbed in one man. The nature of mankind is injured, as also is the
society of the holy Church, which rises into one united body, bound
together in oneness of faith and love. Christ the Lord, also, Who died
for all, will grieve that the price of His blood was paid in vain.

<span id="iv.i.iv.iii-p12"></span>20. Why, the very law of the Lord
teaches us that this rule must be observed, so that we may never deprive
another of anything for the sake of our own advantage. For it says:
“Remove not the bounds which thy fathers have set.” <span
id="fr_618"></span>[619](#fn_618.md) It bids a neighbour’s ox to be brought
back if found wandering. <span id="fr_619"></span>[620](#fn_619.md) It
orders a thief to be put to death. <span
id="fr_620"></span>[621](#fn_620.md) It forbids the labourer to be deprived
of his hire, <span id="fr_621"></span>[622](#fn_621.md) and orders money to
be returned without usury. <span id="fr_622"></span>[623](#fn_622.md) It is
a mark of kindly feeling to help him who has nothing, but it is a sign
of a hard nature to extort more than one has given. If a man has need of
thy assistance because he has not enough of his own wherewith to repay a
debt, is it not a wicked thing to demand under the guise of kindly
feeling a larger sum from him who has not the means to pay off a less
amount? Thou dost but free him from debt to another, to bring him under
thy own hand; and thou callest that human kindliness which is but a
further wickedness.

<span id="iv.i.iv.iii-p18"></span>21. It is in this very matter that we
stand before all other living creatures, for they do not understand how
to do good. Wild beasts snatch away, men share with others. Wherefore
the Psalmist says: “The righteous show<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>
<span id="iv.i.iv.iii-Page_71"></span>eth mercy and giveth.” <span
id="fr_623"></span>[624](#fn_623.md) There are some, however, to whom the
wild beasts do good. They feed their young with what they get, and the
birds satisfy their brood with food; but to men alone has it been given
to feed all as though they were their own. That is so in accordance with
the claims of nature. And if it is not lawful to refuse to give, how is
it lawful to deprive another? And do not our very laws teach us the
same? They order those things which have been taken from others with
injury to their persons or property to be restored with additional
recompense; so as to check the thief from stealing by the penalty, and
by the fine to recall him from his ways.

<span id="iv.i.iv.iii-p20"></span>22. Suppose, however, that some one
did not fear the penalty, or laughed at the fine, would that make it a
worthy thing to deprive another of his own? That would be a mean vice
and suited only to the lowest of the low. So contrary to nature is it,
that while want might seem to drive one to it, yet nature could never
urge it. And yet we find secret theft among slaves, open robbery among
the rich.

<span id="iv.i.iv.iii-p21"></span>23. But what so contrary to nature as
to injure another for our own benefit? The natural feelings of our own
hearts urge us to keep on the watch for all, to undergo trouble, to do
work for all. It is considered also a glorious thing for each one at
risk to himself to seek the quiet of all, and to think it far more
thankworthy to have saved his country from destruction than to have kept
danger from himself. We must think it a far more noble thing to labour
for our country than to pass a quiet life at ease in the full enjoyment
of leisure.

[Next: Chapter IV. As it has been shown that he who injures another for
the sake of his own advantage will undergo terrible punishment at the
hand of his own conscience, it is referred that nothing is useful to one
which is not in the same way useful to all. Thus there is no place among
Christians for the question propounded by the philosophers about two
shipwrecked persons, for they must show love and humility to
all.](2100098.md)
