### <span id="iv.viii.xi-p0.1"></span>Chapter X.

<span id="iv.viii.xi-p1"></span>St. Ambrose returns again to the subject
of Christ, speaking of His goodness in all misery. The various ways in
which the good Physician treats our diseases, and the quickness of the
healing if only we do not neglect to call upon Him. He touches upon the
moral meaning of the will, which he shows was manifested in Peter’s
mother-in-law, and lastly points out what a minister of Christ and
specially a bishop ought to be, and says that they specially must rise
through grace.

<span id="iv.viii.xi-p2"></span>60. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.viii.xi-p2.1"></span>But</span> let us return to the point, and
not, while we are grieving over the wounds of our sins, leave the
physician, and whilst ministering to the sores of others, let our own go
on increasing. The Physician is then here asked for. Do not fear,
because the Lord is great, that perhaps He will not condescend to come
to one who is sick, for He often comes to us from heaven; and is wont to
visit not only the rich but also the poor and the servants of the
poor. <span id="fr_3365"></span>[3366](#fn_3365.md) And so now He comes,
when called upon, to Peter’s mother-in-law. “And He stood over her and
rebuked the fever, and it left her, and immediately she arose and
ministered unto them.” <span id="fr_3366"></span>[3367](#fn_3366.md) As He
is worthy of being remembered, so, too, is He worthy of being longed
for, worthy, too, of love, for His condescension to every single matter
which affects men, and His marvellous acts. He disdains not to visit
widows, and to enter the narrow rooms of a poor cottage. As God He
commands, as man He visits.

<span id="iv.viii.xi-p5"></span>61. Thanks be to the Gospel, by means of
which we also, who saw not Christ when He came into this world, seem to
be with Him when we read His deeds, that as they, to whom He drew near,
borrowed faith from Him, so may He, when we believe His deeds, draw near
to us.

<span id="iv.viii.xi-p6"></span>62. Do you see what kinds of healing are
with Him? He commands the fever, He commands the unclean spirits, at
another place He lays hands on them. He was wont then to heal the sick,
not only by word but also by touch. And do you then, who burn with many
desires, taken either by the beauty or by the fortune of some one,
implore Christ, call in the Physician, stretch forth your right hand to
Him, let the hand of God touch your inmost being, and the grace of the
heavenly Word enter the veins of your inward desires, let God’s right
hand strike the secrets of your heart. He spreads clay on the eyes of
some that they may see, <span id="fr_3367"></span>[3368](#fn_3367.md) and
the Creator of all teaches us that we ought to be mindful of our own
nature, and to discern the vileness of our body; for no one can see
divine things except one who through knowledge of his vileness cannot be
puffed up. Another is bidden to show himself to the priest, that he may
for ever be free from the scales of leprosy. <span
id="fr_3368"></span>[3369](#fn_3368.md) For he alone can preserve his
purity, both of body and soul, who knows how to show himself to that
priest, Whom we have received as an Advocate for our sins, and to Whom
is plainly said: “Thou art a priest for ever after the order of
Melchisedech.” <span id="fr_3369"></span>[3370](#fn_3369.md)

<span id="iv.viii.xi-p10"></span>63. And be not afraid that there will
be any delay in healing. He who is healed by Christ has no hindrances.
You must <span id="page_402">p. 402</span> <span
id="iv.viii.xi-Page_402"></span>use the remedy which you have received;
and as soon as He has given the command, the blind man sees, the
paralytic walks, the dumb speaks, the deaf hears, she that has a fever
ministers, the lunatic is delivered. And do you, then, who ever after an
unseemly fashion languish for desire of anything, entreat the Lord, show
Him your faith, and fear no delay. Where there is prayer, the Word is
present, desire is put to flight, lust departs. And be not afraid of
offending by confession, take it rather as a right, for you who were
before afflicted by an intense disease of the body will begin to
minister to Christ.

<span id="iv.viii.xi-p11"></span>64. And in this place can be seen the
disposition of the will of Peter’s mother-in-law, from which she
received for herself, as it were, the seed corn of what was to come, for
to each his will is the cause of that which is to come. For from the
will springs wisdom, which the wise man takes in marriage to himself,
saying: “I desire to make her my spouse.” <span
id="fr_3370"></span>[3371](#fn_3370.md) This will, then, which at first was
weak and languid under the fever of various desires, afterwards by the
office of the apostles rose up strong to minister unto Christ.

<span id="iv.viii.xi-p13"></span>65. At the same time it is also shown
what he ought to be who ministers to Christ, for first he must be free
from the enticements of various pleasures, he must be free from inward
languor of body and soul, that he may minister the Body and Blood of
Christ. For no one who is sick with his own sins, and far from being
whole, can minister the remedies of the healing of immortality. See what
thou doest, O priest, and touch not the Body of Christ with a fevered
hand. First be healed that thou mayest be able to minister. If Christ
bids those who are now cleansed, but were once leprous, to show
themselves to the priests, <span id="fr_3371"></span>[3372](#fn_3371.md)
how much more is it fitting for the priest himself to be pure. That
widow, then, cannot take it ill that I have not spared her, since I
spare not myself.

<span id="iv.viii.xi-p15"></span>66. Peter’s mother-in-law, it is
written, rose up and ministered to them. Well is it said, rose up, for
the grace of the apostleship was already furnishing a type of the
sacrament. It is proper to the ministers of Christ to rise, according to
that which is written: “Awake, thou that sleepest, and arise from the
dead.” <span id="fr_3372"></span>[3373](#fn_3372.md)

[Next: Chapter XI. Having shown that the pretexts usually alleged for
second marriages have no weight, St. Ambrose declares that he does not
condemn them, though from the Apostle's words he sets forth their
inconveniences, though the state of those twice married is approved in
the Church, and he takes occasion to advert to those heretics who forbid
them. And he says that it is because the strength of different persons
varies that chastity is not commanded, but only recommended.](2100360.md)
