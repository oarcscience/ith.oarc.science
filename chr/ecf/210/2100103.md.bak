<span id="iv.i.iv.ix"></span>

#### <span id="iv.i.iv.ix-p0.1"></span>Chapter IX.

<span id="iv.i.iv.ix-p1"></span>Cheating and dishonest ways of making
money are utterly unfit for clerics whose duty is to serve all. They
ought never to be involved in a money affair, unless it is one affecting
a man’s life. For them the example of David is given, that they should
injure none, even when provoked; also the death of Naboth, to keep them
from preferring life to virtue.

<span id="iv.i.iv.ix-p2"></span>57. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.iv.ix-p2.1"></span>Nothing</span> is more odious than for a man
to have no love for a virtuous life, but instead to be kept excited by
an unworthy business in following out a low line of trade, or to be
inflamed by an avaricious heart, and by day and by night to be eager to
damage another’s property, not to raise the soul to the splendour of a
virtuous life, and not to regard the beauty of true praise.

<span id="iv.i.iv.ix-p3"></span>58. Hence rise inheritances sought by
cunning words and gained under pretence of being self-restrained and
serious. But this is absolutely abhorrent to the idea of a Christian
man. For everything gained by craft and got together by cheating loses
the merit of openness. Even amongst those <span id="page_77">p.
77</span> <span id="iv.i.iv.ix-Page_77"></span>who have undertaken no
duty in the ranks of the clergy it is considered unfitting to seek for
the inheritance of another. Let those who are reaching the end of their
life use their own judgment, so that they may freely make their wills as
they think best, since they will not be able to amend them later. For it
is not honourable to divert the savings that belong to others or have
been got together for them. It is further the duty of the priest or the
cleric to be of use if possible to all and to be harmful to none. <span
id="fr_654"></span>[655](#fn_654.md)

<span id="iv.i.iv.ix-p5"></span>59. If it is not possible to help one
without injuring another, it is better to help neither than to press
hard upon one. Therefore it is not a priest’s duty to interfere in money
affairs. For here it must often happen that he who loses his case
receives harm; and then he considers that he has been worsted through
the action of the intervener. It is a priest’s duty to hurt no one, to
be ready to help all. To be able to do this is in God’s power alone. In
a case of life and death, without doubt it is a grave sin to injure him
whom one ought to help when in danger. But it is foolish to gain others’
hate in taking up money matters, though for the sake of a man’s safety
great trouble and toil may often be undertaken. It is glorious in such a
case to run risks. Let, then, this be firmly held to in the priestly
duties, namely, to injure none, not even when provoked and embittered by
some injury. <span id="fr_655"></span>[656](#fn_655.md) Good was the man
who said: “If I have rewarded evil to those who did me good.” <span
id="fr_656"></span>[657](#fn_656.md) For what glory is it if we do not
injure him who has not injured us? But it is true virtue to forgive when
injured.

<span id="iv.i.iv.ix-p8"></span>60. What a virtuous action was that,
when David wished rather to spare the king his enemy, though he could
have injured him! <span id="fr_657"></span>[658](#fn_657.md) How useful,
too, it was, for it helped him when he succeeded to the throne. For all
learnt to observe faith to their king and not to seize the kingdom, but
to fear and reverence him. Thus what is virtuous was preferred to what
was useful, and then usefulness followed on what was virtuous.

<span id="iv.i.iv.ix-p10"></span>61. But that he spared him was a small
matter; he also grieved for him when slain in war, and mourned for him
with tears, saying: “Ye mountains of Gilboa, let neither dew nor rain
fall upon you; ye mountains of death, for there the shield of the mighty
is cast away, the shield of Saul. It is not anointed with oil, but with
the blood of the wounded and the fat of the warriors. The bow of
Jonathan turned not back and the sword of Saul returned not empty. Saul
and Jonathan were lovely and very dear, inseparable in life, and in
death they were not divided. They were swifter than eagles, they were
stronger than lions. Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed
you in scarlet with your ornaments, who put on gold upon your apparel.
How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! Jonathan was
wounded even to death. I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan;
very pleasant hast thou been unto me. Thy love came to me like the love
of women. How have the mighty fallen and the longed-for weapons
perished! <span id="fr_658"></span>[659](#fn_658.md)

<span id="iv.i.iv.ix-p12"></span>62. What mother could weep thus for her
only son as he wept here for his enemy? Who could follow his benefactor
with such praise as that with which he followed the man who plotted
against his life? How affectionately he grieved, with what deep feeling
he bewailed him! The mountains dried up at the prophet’s curse, and a
divine power filled the judgment of him who spoke it. Therefore the
elements themselves paid the penalty for witnessing the king’s death.

<span id="iv.i.iv.ix-p13"></span>63. And what, in the case of holy
Naboth, was the cause of his death, except his regard for a virtuous
life? For when the king demanded the vineyard from him, promising to
give him money, he refused the price for his father’s heritage as
unseemly, and preferred to shun such shame by dying. “The Lord forbid it
me, that I should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee;” <span
id="fr_659"></span>[660](#fn_659.md) that is, that such reproach may not
fall on me, that God may not allow such wickedness to be attained by
force. He is not speaking about the vines—nor has God care for vines or
plots of ground—but he says it of his fathers’ rights. He could have
received another or the king’s vineyards and been his friend, wherein
men think there is no small usefulness so far as this world is
concerned. But because it was base he thought it could not be useful,
and so he preferred to endure danger with honour intact, rather than
gain what was useful to his own disgrace. I am here again speaking of
what is commonly understood as useful, not that in which there is the
grace of virtuous life.

<span id="iv.i.iv.ix-p15"></span>64. The king could himself have taken
it by force, but that he thought too shameless; then when Naboth was
dead he grieved. <span id="fr_660"></span>[661](#fn_660.md) The Lord also
declared that the woman’s cruelty should be punished by a <span
id="page_78">p. 78</span> <span id="iv.i.iv.ix-Page_78"></span>fitting
penalty, because she was unmindful of virtue and preferred a shameful
gain. <span id="fr_661"></span>[662](#fn_661.md)

<span id="iv.i.iv.ix-p18"></span>65. Every kind of unfair action is
shameful. Even in common things, false weights and unjust measures are
accursed. And if fraud in the market or in business is punished, can it
seem free from reproach if found in the midst of the performance of the
duties of virtue? Solomon says: “A great and a little weight and divers
measures are an abomination before the Lord.” <span
id="fr_662"></span>[663](#fn_662.md) Before that it also says: “A false
balance is abomination to the Lord, but a just weight is acceptable to
Him.” <span id="fr_663"></span>[664](#fn_663.md)
