#### <span id="iv.iv.iii.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.v-p1"></span>The Unity of God is necessarily implied
in the order of Nature, in the Faith, and in Baptism. The gifts of the
Magi declare (1) the Unity of the Godhead; (2) Christ’s Godhead and
Manhood. The truth of the doctrine of the Trinity in Unity is shown in
the Angel walking in the midst of the furnace with Shadrach, Meshach,
and Abednego.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.v-p2"></span>31. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.iii.v-p2.1"></span>All</span> nature testifies to the Unity of
God, inasmuch as the universe is one. The Faith declares that there is
one God, seeing that there is one belief in both the Old and the New
Testament. That there is one Spirit, all holy, <span
id="fr_1727"></span>[1728](#fn_1727.md) grace witnesseth, because there is
one Baptism, in the Name of the Trinity. The prophets proclaim, the
apostles hear, the voice of one God. In one God did the Magi believe,
and they brought, in adoration, gold, frankincense, and myrrh to
Christ’s cradle, confessing, by the gift of gold, His Royalty, and with
the incense worshipping Him as God. For gold is the sign of kingdom,
incense of God, myrrh of burial. <span
id="fr_1728"></span>[1729](#fn_1728.md)

<span id="iv.iv.iii.v-p5"></span><span id="page_206">p. 206</span> <span
id="iv.iv.iii.v-Page_206"></span>32. What, then, was the meaning of the
mystic offerings in the lowly cattle-stalls, save that we should discern
in Christ the difference between the Godhead and the flesh? He is seen
as man, <span id="fr_1729"></span>[1730](#fn_1729.md) He is adored as Lord.
He lies in swaddling-clothes, but shines amid the stars; the cradle
shows His birth, the stars His dominion; <span
id="fr_1730"></span>[1731](#fn_1730.md) it is the flesh that is wrapped in
clothes, the Godhead that receives the ministry of angels. Thus the
dignity of His natural majesty is not lost, and His true assumption of
the flesh is proved.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.v-p8"></span>33. This is our Faith. Thus did God
will that He should be known by all, thus believed the three
children, <span id="fr_1731"></span>[1732](#fn_1731.md) and felt not the
fire into the midst whereof they were cast, which destroyed and burnt up
unbelievers, <span id="fr_1732"></span>[1733](#fn_1732.md) whilst it fell
harmless as dew upon the faithful, <span
id="fr_1733"></span>[1734](#fn_1733.md) for whom the flames kindled by
others became cold, seeing that the torment had justly lost its power in
conflict with faith. For with them there was One in the form of an
angel, <span id="fr_1734"></span>[1735](#fn_1734.md) comforting them, <span
id="fr_1735"></span>[1736](#fn_1735.md) to the end that in the number of
the Trinity one Supreme Power might be praised. God was praised, the Son
of God was seen in God’s angel, holy and spiritual grace spake in the
children. <span id="fr_1736"></span>[1737](#fn_1736.md)

shadowed forth the number of Persons in the Trinity, whilst in the
Angel, who was one, was shown the Unity of power or nature. In another
way, too, St. Ambrose points out, was the Trinity typified in that
event, inasmuch as God was praised, the Angel of God was present, and
the Spirit, or the Grace of God spake in the children.—H.

[Next: Chapter V. The various blasphemies uttered by the Arians against
Christ are cited. Before these are replied to, the orthodox are
admonished to beware of the captious arguments of philosophers,
forasmuch as in these especially did the heretics put their
trust.](2100188.md)
