### <span id="iv.viii.xiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XII.

<span id="iv.viii.xiii-p1"></span>The difference between matters of
precept and of counsel is treated of, as shown in the case of the young
man in the Gospel, and the difference of the rewards set forth both for
counsels and precepts is spoken of.

<span id="iv.viii.xiii-p2"></span>72. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.viii.xiii-p2.1"></span>Marriage</span>, then, is honourable, but
chastity is more honourable, for “he that giveth his virgin in marriage
doeth well, but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth better.” <span
id="fr_3379"></span>[3380](#fn_3379.md) That, then, which is good need not
be avoided, but that which is better should be chosen. And so it is not
laid upon any, but set before him. And, therefore, the Apostle said
well: “Concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord, yet I give
my counsel.” <span id="fr_3380"></span>[3381](#fn_3380.md) For a command is
issued to those subject, counsel is given to friends. Where there is a
commandment, there is a law; where counsel, there is grace. A
commandment is given to enforce what is according to nature, a counsel
to incite us to follow grace. And, therefore, the Law was given to the
Jews, but grace was reserved for the elect. The Law was given that,
through fear of punishment, it might recall those who were wandering
beyond the limits of nature, to their observance, but grace to incite
the elect both by the desire of good things, and also by the promised
rewards.

<span id="iv.viii.xiii-p5"></span>73. You will see the difference
between precept and counsel, if you remember the case of him in the
Gospel, to whom it is first commanded to do no murder, not to commit
adultery, not to bear false witness; for that is a commandment which has
a penalty for its transgression. But when he said that he had fulfilled
all the commandments of the Law, there is given to him a counsel that he
should sell all that he had and follow the Lord, <span
id="fr_3381"></span>[3382](#fn_3381.md) for these things are not imposed as
commands, but are offered as counsels. For there are two ways of
commanding things, one by way of precept, the other by way of counsel.
And so the Lord in one way says: “Thou shalt not kill,” where He gives a
commandment; in the other He says: “If thou wilt be perfect, sell all
that thou hast.” He is, then, not bound by a commandment to whom the
choice is left.

<span id="iv.viii.xiii-p7"></span>74. And so they who have fulfilled the
commandments are able to say: “We are unprofitable servants, we have
done that which was our duty to do.” <span
id="fr_3382"></span>[3383](#fn_3382.md) The virgin does not say this, nor
he who sold all his goods, but they rather await the stored-up <span
id="page_404">p. 404</span> <span
id="iv.viii.xiii-Page_404"></span>rewards like the holy Apostle who
says: “Behold we have forsaken all and followed Thee, what shall we have
therefore?” <span id="fr_3383"></span>[3384](#fn_3383.md) He says not, like
the unprofitable servant, that he has done that which was his duty to
do, but as being profitable to his Master, because he has multiplied the
talents entrusted to him by the increase he has gained, having a good
conscience, and without anxiety as to his merits he expects the reward
of his faith and virtue. And so it is said to him and the others: “Ye
which have followed Me, in the regeneration, when the Son of Man shall
sit in the throne of His glory, shall also yourselves sit upon twelve
thrones, judging the tribes of Israel.” <span
id="fr_3384"></span>[3385](#fn_3384.md) And to those who had faithfully
preserved their talents He promises rewards indeed, though smaller
saying: “Because thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make
thee ruler over many things.” <span id="fr_3385"></span>[3386](#fn_3385.md)
Good faith, then, is due, but mercy is in the rewards. He who has kept
good faith has deserved that good faith should be kept with him; he who
has made good profit, because he has not sought his own benefit, has
gained a claim to a heavenly reward.

[Next: Chapter XIII. St. Ambrose, treating of the words in the Gospel
concerning eunuchs, condemns those who make themselves such. Those only
deserve praise who have through continence gained the victory over
themselves, but no one is to be compelled to live this life, as neither
Christ nor the Apostle laid down such a law, so that the marriage vow is
not to be blamed, though that of chastity is better.](2100362.md)
