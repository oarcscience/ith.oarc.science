#### <span id="iv.i.iii.xvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVII.

<span id="iv.i.iii.xvii-p1"></span>What virtues ought to exist in him
whom we consult. How Joseph and Paul were equipped with them.

<span id="iv.i.iii.xvii-p2"></span>86. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.iii.xvii-p2.1"></span>Such</span>, then, ought he to be who
gives counsel to another, in order that he may offer himself as a
pattern in all good works, in teaching, in trueness of character, in
seriousness. Thus his words will be wholesome and irreproachable, his
counsel useful, his life virtuous, and his opinions seemly.

<span id="iv.i.iii.xvii-p3"></span>87. Such was Paul, who gave counsel
to virgins, <span id="fr_497"></span>[498](#fn_497) guidance to
priests, <span id="fr_498"></span>[499](#fn_498) so as to offer himself
as a pattern for us to copy. Thus he knew how to be humble, as also
Joseph did, who, though sprung from the noble family of the patriarchs,
was not ashamed of his base slavery; rather he adorned it with his ready
service, and made it glorious by his virtues. He knew how to be humble
who had to go through the hands of both buyer and seller, and called
them, Lord. Hear him as he humbles himself: “My lord on my account
knoweth not <span id="fr_499"></span>[500](#fn_499) what is in his
house, and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand, neither hath
he kept back anything from me but thee, because thou art his wife; how,
then, can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?” <span
id="fr_500"></span>[501](#fn_500) Full of humility are his words, full,
too, of chastity. Of humility, for he was obedient to his Lord; of an
honourable spirit, for he was grateful; <span
id="fr_501"></span>[502](#fn_501) full, also, of chastity, for he
thought it a terrible sin to be defiled by so great a crime.

<span id="iv.i.iii.xvii-p9"></span>88. Such, then, ought the man of
counsel to be. He must have nothing dark, or deceptive, or false about
him, to cast a shadow on his life and character, nothing wicked or evil
to keep back those who want advice. For there are some things which one
flies from, others which one despises. <span
id="fr_502"></span>[503](#fn_502) We fly from those things which can do
harm, or can perfidiously and quietly grow to do us hurt, as when he
whose advice we ask is of doubtful honour, or is desirous of money, so
that a certain sum can make him change his mind. If a man acts unjustly,
we fly from him and avoid him. A man that is a pleasure seeker and
extravagant, although he does not act falsely, yet is avaricious and too
fond of filthy lucre; such an one is despised. What proof of hard work,
what fruits of labour, can he give who gives himself up to a sluggish
and idle life, or what cares and anxieties ever enter his mind?

<span id="iv.i.iii.xvii-p11"></span>89. Therefore the man of good
counsel says: “I have learnt in whatsoever state I am therewith to be
content.” <span id="fr_503"></span>[504](#fn_503) For he knew that the
root of all evils is the love of money, <span
id="fr_504"></span>[505](#fn_504) and therefore he was content with what
he had, without seeking for what was another’s. Sufficient for me, he
says, is what I have; whether I have little or much, to me it is much.
It seems as though he wanted to state it as clearly as possible. He
makes use of these words: “I am content,” he says, “with what I have.”
That means: “I neither have want, nor have I too much. I have no want,
for I seek nothing more. I have not too much, for I have it not for
myself, but for the many.” This is said with reference to money.

<span id="iv.i.iii.xvii-p14"></span>90. But he could have said these
words about everything, for all that he had at the moment contented him;
that is, he wanted no greater honour, he sought for no further services,
he was not desirous of vainglory, nor did he look for gratitude where it
was not due; but patient in labours, sure in his merits, he waited for
the end of the struggle that he must needs endure. “I know,” he says,
“how to be abased.” <span id="fr_505"></span>[506](#fn_505) An untaught
humility has no claim to praise, but only that which possesses modesty
and a knowledge of self. For there is a humility that rests on fear,
one, too, that rests on want of skill and ignorance. Therefore the
Scripture says: “He will save the humble in spirit.” <span
id="fr_506"></span>[507](#fn_506) Gloriously, therefore, does he say: “I
know how to be abased;” that is to say, where, in what moderation, to
what end, in what duty, in which office. The Pharisee knew not how to be
abased, therefore he was cast down. The publican knew, and therefore he
was justified. <span id="fr_507"></span>[508](#fn_507)

<span id="iv.i.iii.xvii-p18"></span>91. Paul knew, too, how to abound,
for he had a rich soul, though he possessed not the treasure of a rich
man. He knew how to abound, for he sought no gift in money, but looked
for fruit in grace. We can understand his words that he knew how to
abound also in another way. For he could say again: “O ye Corinthians,
our mouth is open unto you, our heart is enlarged.” <span
id="fr_508"></span>[509](#fn_508)

<span id="iv.i.iii.xvii-p20"></span>92. In all things he was accustomed
both to be full and to be hungry. Blessed is he that knows how to be
full in Christ. Not corporal, but spiritual, is that satiety which
knowledge brings about. And rightly is <span id="page_58">p. 58</span>
<span id="iv.i.iii.xvii-Page_58"></span>there need of knowledge: “For
man lives not by bread alone, but by every word of God.” <span
id="fr_509"></span>[510](#fn_509) For he who knew how to be full also
knew how to be hungry, so as to be always seeking something new,
hungering after God, thirsting for the Lord. He knew how to hunger, for
he knew that the hungry shall eat. <span
id="fr_510"></span>[511](#fn_510) He knew, also, how to abound, and was
able to abound, for he had nothing and yet possessed all things. <span
id="fr_511"></span>[512](#fn_511)
