#### <span id="iv.ii.ii.x-p0.1"></span>Chapter IX.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.x-p1"></span>The Holy Spirit is rightly called the
ointment of Christ, and the oil of gladness; and why Christ Himself is
not the ointment, since He was anointed with the Holy Spirit. It is not
strange that the Spirit should be called Ointment, since the Father and
the Son are also called Spirit. And there is no confusion between them,
since Christ alone suffered death, Whose saving cross is then spoken of.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.x-p2"></span>100. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.ii.ii.x-p2.1"></span>Now</span> many have thought that the <span
id="page_107">p. 107</span> <span id="iv.ii.ii.x-Page_107"></span>Holy
Spirit is the ointment of Christ. And well it is said ointment, because
He is called the oil of gladness, the joining together of many graces
giving a sweet fragrance. But God the Almighty Father anointed Him the
Prince of priests, Who was, not like others anointed in a type under the
Law, but was both according to the Law anointed in the body, and in
truth was full with the virtue of the Holy Spirit from the Father above
the Law.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.x-p3"></span>101. This is the oil of gladness, of
which the prophet says: “God, even Thy God, hath anointed Thee with the
oil of gladness above Thy fellows.” <span
id="fr_914"></span>[915](#fn_914.md) Lastly, Peter says that Jesus was
anointed with the Spirit, as you read: “Ye know that word which went
through all Judea beginning from Galilee after the baptism which John
preached, even Jesus of Nazareth, how God anointed Him with the Holy
Spirit.” <span id="fr_915"></span>[916](#fn_915.md) The Holy Spirit is,
then, the oil of gladness.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.x-p6"></span>102. And well did he say oil of
gladness, lest you should think Him a creature; for it is the nature of
this sort of oil that it will by no means mingle with moisture of
another kind. Gladness, too, does not anoint the body, but brightens the
inmost heart, as the prophet said: “Thou hast put gladness in my
heart.” <span id="fr_916"></span>[917](#fn_916.md) So as he loses his pains
who wishes to mix oil with moister matter, because since the nature of
oil is lighter than others, when the others settle, it rises and is
separated. How do those wretched pedlars think that the oil of gladness
can by their tricks be mingled with other creatures, since of a truth
corporeal things cannot be mingled with in corporeal, nor things created
with uncreated?

<span id="iv.ii.ii.x-p8"></span>102. And well is that called oil of
gladness wherewith Christ was anointed; for neither was usual nor common
oil to be sought for Him, wherewith either wounds are dressed or heat
assuaged; since the salvation of the world did not seek alleviation for
His wounds, nor the eternal might of His wearied Body demand
refreshment.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.x-p9"></span>103. Nor is it wonderful if He have the
oil of gladness, Who made those about to die rejoice, put off sadness
from the world, destroyed the odour of sorrowful death. And so the
Apostle says: “For we are the good odour of Christ to God;” <span
id="fr_917"></span>[918](#fn_917.md) certainly showing that he is speaking
of spiritual things. But when the Son of God Himself says: “The Spirit
of the Lord is upon Me, because He hath anointed Me,” <span
id="fr_918"></span>[919](#fn_918.md) He points out the ointment of the
Spirit. Therefore the Spirit is the ointment of Christ.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.x-p12"></span>104. Or since the Name of Jesus is as
ointment poured out, if they wish to understand Christ Himself, and not
the Spirit of Christ to be expressed under the name of ointment,
certainly when the Apostle Peter says that the Lord Jesus was anointed
with the Holy Spirit, it is without doubt plain that the Spirit also is
called ointment.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.x-p13"></span>105. But what wonder, since both the
Father and the Son are said to be Spirit. Of which we shall speak more
fully when we begin to speak of the Unity of the Name. Yet since most
suitable place occurs here, that we may not seem to have passed on
without a conclusion, let them read that both the Father is called
Spirit, as the Lord said in the Gospel, “for God is Spirit;” <span
id="fr_919"></span>[920](#fn_919.md) and Christ is called Spirit, for
Jeremiah said: “The Spirit before our face, Christ the Lord.” <span
id="fr_920"></span>[921](#fn_920.md)

<span id="iv.ii.ii.x-p16"></span>106. So, then, both the Father is
Spirit and Christ is Spirit, for that which is not a created body is
spirit, but the Holy Spirit is not commingled with the Father and the
Son, but is distinct from the Father and from the Son. For the Holy
Spirit did not die, Who could not die because He had not taken flesh
upon Him, and the eternal Godhead was incapable of dying, but Christ
died according to the flesh.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.x-p17"></span>107. For of a truth He died in that
which He took of the Virgin, not in that which He had of the Father, for
Christ died in that nature in which He was crucified. But the Holy
Spirit could not be crucified, Who had not flesh and bones, but the Son
of God was crucified, Who took flesh and bones, that on that cross the
temptations of our flesh might die. For He took on Him that which He was
not that He might hide that which He was; He hid that which He was that
He might be tempted in it, and that which He was not might be redeemed,
in order that He might call us by means of that which He was not to that
which He was.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.x-p18"></span>108. O the divine mystery of that
cross, on which weakness hangs, might is free, vices are nailed, and
triumphal trophies raised. So that a certain saint said: “Pierce my
flesh with nails for fear of Thee;” <span
id="fr_921"></span>[922](#fn_921.md) he says not with nails of iron, but of
fear and faith. For the bonds of virtue are stronger than those of
punishment. Lastly, his faith bound Peter, when he had followed the Lord
as far as the hall of the high priest, whom no one had bound, <span
id="page_108">p. 108</span> <span id="iv.ii.ii.x-Page_108"></span>and
punishment loosened not him, whom faith bound. Again, when he was bound
by the Jews, prayer loosed him, punishment did not hold him, because he
had not gone back from Christ.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.x-p20"></span>109. Therefore do you also crucify sin,
that you may die to sin; he who dies to sin lives to God; do you live to
Him Who spared not His own Son, that in His body He might crucify our
passions. For Christ died for us, that we might live in His revived
Body. Therefore not our life but our guilt died in Him, “Who,” it is
said, “bare our sins in His own Body on the tree; that being set free
from our sins we might live in righteousness, by the wound of Whose
stripes we are healed.” <span id="fr_922"></span>[923](#fn_922.md)

<span id="iv.ii.ii.x-p22"></span>110. That wood of the cross is, then,
as it were a kind of ship of our salvation, our passage, not a
punishment, for there is no other salvation but the passage of eternal
salvation. Whilst expecting death I do not feel it; whilst thinking
little of punishment I do not suffer; whilst careless of fear I know it
not.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.x-p23"></span>111. Who, then, is He by the wound of
Whose stripes we are healed but Christ the Lord? of Whom the same Isaiah
prophesied His stripes were our healing, <span
id="fr_923"></span>[924](#fn_923.md) of Whom Paul the Apostle wrote in his
epistle: “Who knew no sin, but was made sin for us.” <span
id="fr_924"></span>[925](#fn_924.md) This, indeed, was divine in Him, that
His Flesh did no sin, nor did the creature of the body take in Him sin.
For what wonder would it be if the Godhead alone sinned not, seeing It
had no incentives to sin? But if God alone is free from sin, certainly
every creature by its own nature can be, as we have said, liable to sin.
