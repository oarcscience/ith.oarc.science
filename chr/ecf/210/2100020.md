#### <span id="iv.i.ii.viii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VIII.

<span id="iv.i.ii.viii-p1"></span>The word “Duty” has been often used
both by philosophers and in the holy Scriptures; from whence it is
derived.

<span id="iv.i.ii.viii-p2"></span>25. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.ii.viii-p2.1"></span>Since</span>, therefore, the person
concerned is one fit to write on the Duties, let us see whether the
subject itself stands on the same ground, and whether this word is
suitable only to the schools of the philosophers, or is also to be found
in the sacred Scriptures. Beautifully has the Holy Spirit, as it
happens, brought before us a passage in reading the Gospel to-day, as
though He would urge us to write; whereby we are confirmed in our view,
that the word *officium,* “duty,” may also be used with us. For when
Zacharias the priest was struck dumb in the temple, and could not speak,
it is said: “And it came to pass that as soon as the days of his duty
\[*officii*\] were accomplished, he departed to his own house.” <span
id="fr_59"></span>[60](#fn_59.md) We read, therefore, that the word
*officium,* “duty,” can be used by us.

<span id="iv.i.ii.viii-p4"></span>26. <span
id="fr_60"></span>[61](#fn_60.md) And this is not inconsistent with reason,
since we consider that the word *officium* (duty) is derived from
*efficere* (to effect), and is formed with the change of one letter for
the sake of euphony; or at any rate that you should do those things
which injure \[*officiant*\] no one, but benefit all.

23](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#023.md)<span
id="iv.i.ii.viii-p3.1"></span>. The Vulgate has *officii;* the Greek
text reads: <span class="Greek"><span id="iv.i.ii.viii-p3.2"></span>τῆς
λειτουργίας</span>.

<span id="fn_60"></span>[5:61](2100020.htm#fr_60.md) <span

<span id="iv.i.ii.viii-p5"></span> In this section it is impossible to
give the point in a translation, but the passage does not affect the
argument. The text runs as follows: “*Nec ratio ipsa abhorret,
quandoquidem officium ab efficiendo dictum putamus, quasi efficium: sed
propter decorem sermonis una immutata litera, officium nuncupari, vel
certe, ut ea agas quæ nulli officiant, prosint omnibus.*”

[Next: Chapter IX. A duty is to be chosen from what is virtuous, and
from what is useful, and also from the comparison of the two, one with
the other; but nothing is recognized by Christians as virtuous or useful
which is not helpful to the future life. This treatise on duty,
therefore, will not be superfluous.](2100021.md)
