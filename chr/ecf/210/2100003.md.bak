## <span id="iii.i-p0.1"></span>I.—Literature.

<span id="iii.i-p1"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="iii.i-p1.1"></span>§1. <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.i-p1.2"></span>Editions.</span></span>

<span id="iii.i-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iii.i-p2.1"></span>All</span> the Editions of the works of St.
Ambrose which preceded that of the Benedictines are very inadequate. Of
these the chief are the following:

<span id="iii.i-p3"></span>1. Venice, <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.i-p3.1"></span>a.d.</span> 1485.

<span id="iii.i-p4"></span>2. Cribellius, <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.i-p4.1"></span>a.d.</span> 1490.

<span id="iii.i-p5"></span>3. Auerbach, Basel, <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.i-p5.1"></span>a.d.</span> 1492, reprinted in 1506, with a full
Index. These are very faulty Editions.

<span id="iii.i-p6"></span>4. Erasmus, Basel, <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.i-p6.1"></span>a.d.</span> 1527, reprinted and re-edited by
different persons, in various places \[by Baronius amongst others, <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.i-p6.2"></span>a.d.</span> 1549\].

<span id="iii.i-p7"></span>5. Gillot Campanus, Paris, <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.i-p7.1"></span>a.d.</span> 1568.

<span id="iii.i-p8"></span>6. Felix de Montalto \[afterwards Pope Sixtus
V.\], Rome, <span class="sc"><span id="iii.i-p8.1"></span>a.d.</span>
1580–1585, reprinted at Paris, <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.i-p8.2"></span>a.d.</span> 1603.

<span id="iii.i-p9"></span>7. The Benedictines of St. Maur, Paris, <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.i-p9.1"></span>a.d.</span> 1686–1690, reprinted
at Venice, <span class="sc"><span id="iii.i-p9.2"></span>a.d.</span>
1748 and 1781, as well as with additions by Migne, Patres Latini, Vols.
XIV.–XVII.

<span id="iii.i-p10"></span>8. A new edition by Ballerini, Milan, <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.i-p10.1"></span>a.d.</span> 1875–1886, founded
on that of the Benedictines, but by no means superior to it.

<span id="iii.i-p11"></span>There is still room for a critical edition
of the works of this great Father, which are unfortunately very corrupt,
but in many points it is not likely that the work of the Benedictine
editors can be improved upon.

<span id="iii.i-p12"></span>9. There are separate editions of some of
the treatises of St. Ambrose, as of the *Hexaëmeron* and *De Officiis
Clericorum*, in the Bibliotheca Patrum Eccl. Latinæ Selecta, Leipzig,
Tauchnitz. The *De Officiis* has also been edited, with considerable
improvements in the text, by Krabinger, Tübingen, 1857, and the *De
Fide* and *De Pœnitentia*, by Hurter in the Vienna selections from the
Fathers.

<span id="iii.i-p13"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="iii.i-p13.1"></span>§2. <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.i-p13.2"></span>Translations.</span></span>

<span id="iii.i-p14"></span>There seems to have never been any attempt
to translate the works of this great Christian Father and Doctor in
full.

<span id="iii.i-p15"></span>Some few treatises, *De Officiis, De excessu
fratris Satyri, De Virginitate,* and several other short ones, appear in
German, in the select writings of the Fathers, published by Kosel of
Kempten. The Epistles have been translated into French by Bonrecueil,
Paris, <span class="sc"><span id="iii.i-p15.1"></span>a.d.</span> 1746;
and the *De Officiis* and Epistles into English, the former by Humfrey,
London, <span class="sc"><span id="iii.i-p15.2"></span>a.d.</span> 1637;
the latter in the Oxford “Library of the Fathers,” revised by E.
Walford, London, 1881; whilst the *De Mysteriis* appears in a little
volume of Sacramental Treatises, published by Messrs. J. Parker & Co.,
Oxford, under the supervision of the Editor of this volume. There is a
very valuable little monograph entitled *Studia Ambrosiana,* chiefly
critical, and unfortunately brief, by Maximilian Ihm. Leipzig, Teubner,
1889.

<span id="iii.i-p19"></span> Paulinus, who had been in constant
attendance on St. Ambrose, and was with him at his death, wrote this
