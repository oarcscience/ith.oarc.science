#### <span id="iv.i.iii.xx-p0.1"></span>Chapter XX.

<span id="iv.i.iii.xx-p1"></span>Familiarity with good men is very
advantageous to all, especially to the young, as is shown by the example
of Joshua and Moses and others. Further, those who are unlike in age are
often alike in virtues, as Peter and John prove.

<span id="iv.i.iii.xx-p2"></span>97. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.iii.xx-p2.1"></span>It</span> is a very good thing to unite
oneself to a good man. It is also very useful for the young <span
id="fr_516"></span>[517](#fn_516) to follow the guidance of great and
wise men. For he who lives in company with wise men is wise himself; but
he who clings to the foolish is looked on as a fool too. This friendship
with the wise is a great help in teaching us, and also as giving a sure
proof of our uprightness. Young men show very soon that they imitate
those to whom they attach themselves. And this idea gains ground from
the fact that in all their daily life they grow to be like those with
whom they have enjoyed intercourse to the full.

<span id="iv.i.iii.xx-p4"></span>98. Joshua the son of Nun became so
great, because his union with Moses was the means not only of
instructing him in a knowledge of the law, but also of sanctifying him
to receive grace. When in His tabernacle the majesty of the Lord was
seen to shine forth in its divine Presence, Joshua alone was in the
tabernacle. When Moses spoke with God, Joshua too was covered by the
sacred cloud. <span id="fr_517"></span>[518](#fn_517) The priests and
people stood below, and Joshua and Moses went up the mount to receive
the law. All the people were within the camp; <span id="page_59">p.
59</span> <span id="iv.i.iii.xx-Page_59"></span>Joshua was without the
camp in the tabernacle of witness. When the pillar of a cloud came down,
and God spoke with Moses, he stood as a trusty servant beside him; and
he, a young man, did not go out of the tabernacle, though the old men
who stood afar off trembled at these divine wonders.

<span id="iv.i.iii.xx-p6"></span>99. Everywhere, therefore, he alone
kept close to holy Moses amid all these wondrous works and dread
secrets. Wherefore it happens that he who had been his companion in this
intercourse with God succeeded to his power. <span
id="fr_518"></span>[519](#fn_518) Worthy surely was he to stand forth as
a man who might stay the course of the river, <span
id="fr_519"></span>[520](#fn_519) and who might say: “Sun, stand still,”
and delay the night and lengthen the day, as though to witness his
victory. <span id="fr_520"></span>[521](#fn_520) Why?—a blessing denied
to Moses—he alone was chosen to lead the people into the promised land.
A man he was, great in the wonders he wrought by faith, great in his
triumphs. The works of Moses were of a higher type, his brought greater
success. Either of these then aided by divine grace rose above all human
standing. The one ruled the sea, the other heaven. <span
id="fr_521"></span>[522](#fn_521)

<span id="iv.i.iii.xx-p11"></span>100. Beautiful, therefore, is the
union between old and young. The one to give witness, the other to give
comfort; the one to give guidance, the other to give pleasure. I pass by
Lot, who when young clung to Abraham, as he was setting out. <span
id="fr_522"></span>[523](#fn_522) For some perhaps might say this arose
rather owing to their relationship than from any voluntary action on his
part. And what are we to say of Elijah and Elisha? <span
id="fr_523"></span>[524](#fn_523) Though Scripture has not in so many
words stated that Elisha was a young man, yet we gather from it that he
was the younger. In the Acts of the Apostles, Barnabas took Mark with
him, and Paul took Silas <span id="fr_524"></span>[525](#fn_524) and
Timothy <span id="fr_525"></span>[526](#fn_525) and Titus. <span
id="fr_526"></span>[527](#fn_526)

<span id="iv.i.iii.xx-p17"></span>101. We see also that duties were
divided amongst them according to their superiority in anything. The
elders took the lead in giving counsel, the younger in showing activity.
Often, too, those who were alike in virtue but unlike in years were
greatly rejoiced at their union, as Peter and John were. We read in the
Gospel that John was a young man, even in his own words, though he was
behind none of the elders in merits and wisdom. For in him there was a
venerable ripeness of character and the prudence of the hoarhead. An
unspotted life is the due of a good old age.

[Next: Chapter XXI. To defend the weak, or to help strangers, or to
perform similar duties, greatly adds to one's worth, especially in the
case of tried men. Whilst one gets great blame for love of money;
wastefulness, also, in the case of priests is very much
condemned.](2100084)
