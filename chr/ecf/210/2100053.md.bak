#### <span id="iv.i.ii.xli-p0.1"></span>Chapter XLI.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xli-p1"></span>After praising Judas’ and Jonathan’s
loftiness of mind, the constancy of the martyrs in their endurance of
tortures, which is no small part of fortitude, is next brought before
us.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xli-p2"></span>209. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.ii.xli-p2.1"></span>But</span> as fortitude is proved not only
by prosperity but also in adversity, let us now consider the death of
Judas Maccabæus. For he, after Nicanor, the general of King Demetrius,
was defeated, boldly engaged 20,000 of the king’s army with 900 men who
were anxious to retire for fear of being overcome by so great a
multitude, but whom he persuaded to endure a glorious death rather than
to retire in disgraceful flight. “Let us not leave,” he says, “any stain
upon our glory.” Thus, then, engaging in battle after having fought from
sunrise till evening, he attacks and quickly drives back the right wing,
where he sees the strongest troop of the enemy to be. But whilst
pursuing the fugitives from the rear he gave a chance for a wound to be
inflicted. <span id="fr_305"></span>[306](#fn_305.md) Thus he found the
spot of death more full of glory for himself than any triumph.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xli-p4"></span>210. Why need I further mention his
brother Jonathan, who fought against the king’s force, with but a small
troop. <span id="fr_306"></span>[307](#fn_306.md) Though forsaken by his
men, and left with only two, he retrieved the battle, drove back the
enemy, and recalled his own men, who were flying in every direction, to
share in his triumph.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xli-p6"></span>211. Here, then, is fortitude in war,
which bears no light impress of what is virtuous and seemly upon it, for
it prefers death to slavery and disgrace. But what am I to say of the
sufferings of the martyrs? Not to go too far abroad, did not the
children of Maccabæus gain triumphs over the proud King Antiochus, as
great as those of their fathers? The latter in truth were armed, but
they conquered without arms. The company of the seven brothers stood
unconquered, <span id="fr_307"></span>[308](#fn_307.md) though surrounded
by the legions of the king—tortures failed, tormentors ceased; but the
martyrs failed not. One, having had the skin of his head pulled off,
though changed in appearance, grew in courage. Another, bidden to put
forth his tongue, so that it might be cut off, answered: “The Lord hears
not only those who speak, for He heard Moses when silent. He hears
better the silent thoughts of His own than the voice of all others. Dost
thou fear the scourge of my tongue—and dost thou not fear the scourge of
blood spilt upon the ground? Blood, too, has a voice whereby it cries
aloud to God—as it did in the case of Abel.”

<span id="iv.i.ii.xli-p8"></span>212. What shall I say of the
mother <span id="fr_308"></span>[309](#fn_308.md) who with joy looked on
the corpses of her children as so many trophies, and found delight in
the voices of her dying sons, as though in the songs of singers, noting
in her children the tones of the glorious harp <span id="page_35">p.
35</span> <span id="iv.i.ii.xli-Page_35"></span>of her own heart, and a
sweeter harmony of love than any strain of the lute could give?

<span id="iv.i.ii.xli-p10"></span>213. What shall I say of those
two-year-old children of Bethlehem, <span
id="fr_309"></span>[310](#fn_309.md) who received the palm of victory
before they felt their natural life within them? What of St. Agnes, who
when in danger as regards two great matters, that is, chastity and life,
protected her chastity and exchanged life for immortality?

<span id="iv.i.ii.xli-p12"></span>214. And let us not pass by St.
Lawrence, who, seeing Xystus his bishop led to martyrdom, began to weep,
not at his sufferings but at the fact that he himself was to remain
behind. With these words he began to address him: “Whither, father,
goest thou without thy son? Whither, holy priest, art thou hastening
without thy deacon? Never wast thou wont to offer sacrifice without an
attendant. What are thou displeased at in me, my father? Hast thou found
me unworthy? Prove, then, whether thou hast chosen a fitting servant. To
him to whom thou hast entrusted the consecration <span
id="fr_310"></span>[311](#fn_310.md) of the Saviour’s blood, <span
id="fr_311"></span>[312](#fn_311.md) to whom thou hast granted fellowship
in partaking of the Sacraments, to him dost thou refuse a part in thy
death? Beware lest thy good judgment be endangered, whilst thy fortitude
receives its praise. The rejection of a pupil is the loss of the
teacher; or how is it that noble and illustrious men gain the victory in
the contests of their scholars rather than in their own? Abraham offered
his son, Peter sent Stephen on before him! Do thou, father, show forth
thy courage in thy son. Offer me whom thou hast trained, that thou,
confident in thy choice of me, mayest reach the crown in worthy
company.”

<span id="iv.i.ii.xli-p15"></span>215. Then Xystus said: “I leave thee
not nor forsake thee. Greater struggles yet await thee. We as old men
have to undergo an easier fight; a more glorious triumph over the tyrant
awaits thee, a young man. Soon shalt thou come. Cease weeping; after
three days thou shalt follow me. This interval must come between the
priest and his levite. It was not for thee to conquer under the eye of
thy master, as though thou neededst a helper. Why dost thou seek to
share in my death? I leave to thee its full inheritance. Why dost thou
need my presence? Let the weak disciples go before their master, let the
brave follow him, that they may conquer without him. For they no longer
need his guidance. So Elijah left Elisha. To thee I entrust the full
succession to my own courage.”

<span id="iv.i.ii.xli-p16"></span>216. Such was their contention, and
surely a worthy one, wherein priest and attendant strove as to who
should be the first to suffer for the name of Christ. When that tragic
piece is played, it is said there is great applause in the theatre as
Pylades says he is Orestes, whilst Orestes declares that he is really
himself. The former acted as he did, that he might die for Orestes, and
Orestes, that he might not allow Pylades to be slain instead of himself.
But it was not right that they should live, for each of them was guilty
of parricide, the one because he had committed the crime, the other
because he had helped in its commission. But here there was nothing to
call holy Lawrence to act thus but his love and devotion. However, after
three days he was placed upon the gridiron by the tyrant whom he mocked,
and was burnt. He said: “The flesh is roasted, turn it and eat.” So by
the courage of his mind he overcame the power of fire.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xli-p14"></span> Consecration seems a strange
expression in the mouth of a deacon, but it may be explained either by
the intimate connection between the celebrant and his deacon, as at the
present day in the Liturgy of the Eastern Church; or it may refer to the
hallowing of the faithful in the partaking of the Sacrament. The word
*consecratio* is not always restrained to the consecration properly so
called, as may be seen by the prayer in the Roman missal said by the
priest when he drops a consecrated particle into the chalice which has
also been already consecrated;—“*Hæc commixtio et consecratio Corporis
et Sansguinis…fiat nobis in vitam æternam.*”
