<span id="iv.vii.ii.iv"></span>

#### <span id="iv.vii.ii.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.

<span id="iv.vii.ii.iv-p1"></span>The comeliness of virginity never
existed amongst the heathen, neither with the vestal virgins, nor
amongst philosophers, such as Pythagoras.

<span id="iv.vii.ii.iv-p2"></span>14. I <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vii.ii.iv-p2.1"></span>certainly</span> have not this in common
with the heathen, nor in regard to it am I associated with barbarians,
nor practise it with other animals, with whom, although we breathe one
and the same vital air, and have a common condition of an earthly body,
and from whom we differ not in the mode of generation, in this point
alone we nevertheless avoid the reproach of likeness, that virginity is
aimed at by the heathen, but when consecrated it is violated, it is
attacked by barbarians, and is unknown to others.

<span id="iv.vii.ii.iv-p3"></span>15. Who will allege to me the virgins
of Vesta, and the priests of Pallas? What sort of chastity is that which
is not of morals, but of years, which is appointed not for ever, but for
a term! Such purity is all the more wanton of which the corruption is
put off for a later age. They teach their virgins ought not to
persevere, and are unable to do so, who have set a term to virginity.
What sort of a religion is that <span id="page_366">p. 366</span> <span
id="iv.vii.ii.iv-Page_366"></span>in which modest maidens are bidden to
be immodest old women? Nor is she modest who is bound by law, and she
immodest who is set free by law. O the mystery! O the morals! where
chastity is enforced by law and authority given for lust! And so she is
not chaste, who is constrained by fear; nor honourable, who is hired for
a price; nor is that modesty which, exposed to the daily importunity of
lascivious eyes, is attacked by disgraceful looks. Exemptions are
bestowed upon them, prices are offered them, as though to sell one’s
chastity were not the greatest sign of wantonness. That which is
promised for a price is given up for a price; is made over for a price;
is considered to have its price. She who is wont to sell her chastity
knows not how to redeem it.

<span id="iv.vii.ii.iv-p4"></span>16. What shall I say of the Phrygian
rites, in which immodesty is the rule, and that too of the weaker sex?
What of the orgies of Bacchus, where the mystery of the rites is an
incentive to lust? Of what sort can the lives of priests be, then, where
the adulteries of the gods are matters of religion. So then they have no
sacred virgins.

<span id="iv.vii.ii.iv-p5"></span>17. Let us see whether perchance the
precepts of philosophers have formed any, for they are wont to claim the
teaching of all virtues. A certain Pythagorean virgin is spoken of in
story, whom a tyrant was endeavouring to compel to reveal the secret,
and lest it should be possible even in her torments for revelation to be
extorted from her, she bit off her tongue and spat it in the tyrant’s
face, that he who would not make an end of questioning might not have
aught to question.

<span id="iv.vii.ii.iv-p6"></span>18. But that same virgin, so constant
in mind, was overcome by lust, though she could not be overcome by
torments. And so she who could keep the secret of her mind could not
conceal the shame of her body. She overcame nature, but observed not
discipline. How she would desire that her speech had existed as a
defence of her chastity! So she was not unconquered on every side, for
although the tyrant could not find out that which he sought, yet he did
find what he sought not.

<span id="iv.vii.ii.iv-p7"></span>19. How much stronger are our virgins,
who overcome even those powers which they do not see; whose victory is
not only over flesh and blood, but also over the prince of this world,
and ruler of this age! In age, Agnes indeed was less, but in virtue
greater, triumphing over more, more constant in her confidence; she did
not destroy her tongue through fear, but kept it for a trophy. For there
was nothing in her which she feared to betray, since that which she
acknowledged was holy, not sinful. And so the former merely concealed
her secret, the latter bore witness to the Lord, and confessed Him in
her body, Whom her age did not yet suffer to confess.

[Next: Chapter V. Heaven is the home of virginity, and the Son of God
its Author, Who though He was a Virgin before the Virgin, yet being of
the Virgin took the Virgin Church as His bride. Of her we have all been
born. Some of her gifts are enumerated. Her daughters have a special
excellence in that virginity is not a matter of precept, and that it is
a most powerful help in the pursuit of piety.](2100325.md)
