## <span id="iii.iv-p0.1"></span>IV. On the Doctrine of St. Ambrose.

<span id="iii.iv-p1"></span>There is a very complete agreement on the
part of St. Ambrose with the Catholic teaching of the universal Church.
St. Augustine speaks of him as “a faithful teacher of the Church, and
even at the risk of his life a most strenuous defender of Catholic
truth,” <span id="fr_1"></span>[2](#fn_1.md) “whose skill, constancy,
labours, and perils, both on account of what he did and what he wrote,
the Roman world unhesitatingly proclaims.” <span
id="fr_2"></span>[3](#fn_2.md) In matters both of faith and morals by his
words and writings he greatly benefited the Church and was called by St.
Jerome “a pillar of the Church.” <span id="fr_3"></span>[4](#fn_3.md)

<span id="iii.iv-p5"></span>In his dogmatic treatises, more particularly
in his books on the Faith, he shows great skill and penetration, and his
reasoning is full and clear, meeting the most subtle objections with
patient industry. Scarcely any ancient writer has treated the mystery of
the Holy Trinity and the theological difficulties connected with it more
clearly and convincingly than St. Ambrose in his *De Fide* and *De
Spiritu Sancto.*

<span id="iii.iv-p6"></span>In his expositions of Holy Scripture he
treats of the threefold sense, the literal, the moral, and the mystical,
devoting more pains, however, and time to the latter than to the former.
He gives special consideration to the mystical interpretation of such
passages as may seem to contain in a literal sense anything diverging
from sound morality. Many of his other mystical interpretations of
plain, simple matters of fact have much beauty, as in his treatment of
the story of the building of the ark, the marriage of Isaac, and the
blessings of the Patriarchs. The literal sense is followed specially in
the *Hexaëmeron,* the treatise on Paradise, Noah and the Ark, and the
Exposition of the Gospel according to St. Luke. The moral sense, though
referred to throughout his writings, is more particularly sought out in
the Expositions of the Psalms.

<span id="iii.iv-p7"></span>St. Ambrose was a diligent student of the
Greek writers, whom he often follows largely, especially Origen and
Didymus, as also St. Basil the Great and St. Athanasius, and he has also
adapted many points of allegorical interpretation from Philo. He is fond
of alleging scriptural proofs, and when he argues from reason often
confirms his argument by some quotation or reference, a task easy for
him who, from his consecration, was so diligent a student of holy
Scripture.

<span id="iii.iv-p8"></span>As to justification, St. Ambrose ascribes
the whole work to the Holy Spirit, Who seals us in our hearts, as we
receive the outward sign in our bodies. Through the Holy Spirit we
receive a share of the grace of adoption. Christ was perfect according
to the fulness of His Majesty; we are perfected by a continual progress
in virtue. <span id="fr_4"></span>[5](#fn_4.md)

<span id="iii.iv-p10"></span>With regard to baptism, he taught in
accordance with the received belief of his day that it is the sacrament
of adoption and regeneration, wherein sin is forgiven, <span
id="fr_5"></span>[6](#fn_5.md) and the Holy Spirit confers new life upon
the soul and joins it mystically to Christ. As to the Real Presence in
the Sacrament of the Eucharist, his doctrine is no less definite. In his
treatise on the Faith he says of the elements that they “are
transfigured \[*transfigurantur*\] <span id="fr_6"></span>[7](#fn_6.md) by
the mystery of the sacred prayer into flesh and blood.” <span
id="fr_7"></span>[8](#fn_7.md) He interprets various texts, also, in many
places in the same sense. In a like spirit he maintains that the power
of forgiving sins on repentance is vested in the ministry of the
Church. <span id="fr_8"></span>[9](#fn_8.md) The intercession of the
saints, and up to a certain point their invocation, is likewise
upheld. <span id="fr_9"></span>[10](#fn_9.md)

<span id="iii.iv-p16"></span>There was a Latin version made from the
Septuagint, including the Apocrypha, in Africa, and in use there at the
end of the second century, very barbarous, and copying even Greek
constructions. Of this text SS. Ambrose and Augustine used a recension.
But our author seems to have been very independent, and to have made use
of several different versions of holy Scripture, translating, as it
would seem, often for himself from the Septuagint, referring also to
Symmachus, Theodotion, and Aquila, though thinking less of the latter.
When the prophets, he says, were moved by the Holy Spirit, they were
troubled and darkened with their own ignorance. <span
id="fr_10"></span>[11](#fn_10.md) Prayer, he asserts, is necessary for
understanding holy Scripture. <span id="fr_11"></span>[12](#fn_11.md) Each
Testament is not equally easy, and we are not to criticise what <span
id="page_xv">p. xv</span> <span id="iii.iv-Page_xv"></span>we do not
understand. <span id="fr_12"></span>[13](#fn_12.md) He speaks of the Hebrew
as the truth, <span id="fr_13"></span>[14](#fn_13.md) but states that the
Septuagint added much that is useful. <span
id="fr_14"></span>[15](#fn_14.md)

<span id="iii.iv-p22"></span>The Arians are repeatedly charged by St.
Ambrose with falsifying and manipulating Scripture for their own ends,
not always, it would seem, very justly, but the same charge is a common
one against all heretical bodies in early days. As to the Canon, he
would seem to have no very definite rule. He admits Tobit as prophetic,
Judith as canonical, nor does he distinguish between canonical and
deuterocanonical, while the sapiential books are all attributed to
Solomon. He quotes Baruch as Jeremiah, and refers to the History of
Susanna, Bel and the Dragon, and other apocryphal works as “Scripture.”
Ezra, he says, re-established holy Scripture by memory, <span
id="fr_15"></span>[16](#fn_15.md) and he quotes the fourth book of Esdras.
