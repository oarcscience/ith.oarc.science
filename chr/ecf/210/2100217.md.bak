<span id="iv.iv.iv.xiii"></span>

#### <span id="iv.iv.iv.xiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XII.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xiii-p1"></span>*Do the Catholics or the Arians take
the better course to assure themselves of the favour of Christ as their
Judge? An objection grounded on* <span
id="iv.iv.iv.xiii-p1.1"></span>*[Ps. cx.
1](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#001.md)<span
id="iv.iv.iv.xiii-p1.2"></span>* *is disposed of, it being shown that
when the Son is invited by the Father to sit at His right hand, no
subjection is intended to be signified—nor yet any preferment, in that
the Son sits at the Father’s right hand. The truth of the Trinity of
Persons in God, and of the Unity of their Nature, is shown to be proved
by the angelic Trisagion.*

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xiii-p2"></span>100. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.iv.xiii-p2.1"></span>Howbeit</span>, if our adversaries cannot
be turned by kindness, let us summon them before the Judge. To what
Judge, then, shall we go? Surely to Him Who hath the Judgment. To the
Father, then? Nay, but “the Father judgeth no man, for He hath given all
judgment to the Son.” <span id="fr_2048"></span>[2049](#fn_2048.md) He hath
given, that is to say, not as of largess, but in the act of generation.
See, then, how unwilling He was that thou shouldst dishonour His
Son—even so that He gave Him to be thy Judge.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xiii-p4"></span>101. Let us see, then, before the
judgment which hath the better cause, thou or I? Surely it is the care
of a prudent party to a suit to gain first the favourable regard of the
judge. Thou dost honour man,—dost thou not honour God? Which of the two,
I ask, wins the favour of the magistrate—respect or contempt? Suppose
that I am in error—as I certainly am not: is Christ displeased with the
honour shown Him? We are all sinners—who, then, will deserve
forgiveness, he who renders worship, or he who displays insolence?

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xiii-p5"></span>102. If reasoning move thee not, at
least let the plain aspect of the judgment move thee! Raise thine eyes
to the Judge, see Who it is that is seated, with Whom He is seated, and
where. Christ sitteth at the right hand of the Father. If with thine
eyes thou canst not perceive this, hear the words of the prophet: “The
Lord said unto my Lord, Sit Thou on My right hand.” <span
id="fr_2049"></span>[2050](#fn_2049.md) The Son, therefore, sitteth at the
right hand of the Father. Tell me now, thou who holdest that the things
of God are to be judged of from the things of this world—say whether
thou thinkest Him Who sits at the right hand to be lower? Is it any
dishonour to the Father that He sits at the Son’s left hand? The Father
honours the Son, and thou makest it to be insult! The Father would have
this invitation to be a sign of love and esteem, and thou wouldst make
it an overlord’s command! Christ hath risen from the dead, and sitteth
at the right hand of God.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xiii-p7"></span>103. “But,” you object, “the Father
*said.*” Good, hear now a passage where the Father doth not speak, and
the Son prophesies: “Hereafter ye shall see the Son of Man sitting at
the right hand of power.” <span id="fr_2050"></span>[2051](#fn_2050.md)
This He said with regard to taking back to Himself His body—to Him <span
id="fr_2051"></span>[2052](#fn_2051.md) the Father said: “Sit Thou at My
right hand.” If indeed you ask of the eternal abode of the Godhead, He
said—when Pilate asked Him whether He were the King of the Jews—“For
this I was born.” <span id="fr_2052"></span>[2053](#fn_2052.md) And so
indeed the Apostle shows that it is good for us to believe that Christ
sitteth at the right hand of God, not by command, nor of any boon, but
as God’s most dearly beloved Son. For it is written for you: “Seek the
things that are above, where Christ is, sitting at the right hand of
God; savour the things that are above.” <span
id="fr_2053"></span>[2054](#fn_2053.md) This is to savour the things that
be above—to believe that Christ, in His sitting, does not obey as one
who receives a command, but is honoured as the well-beloved Son. It is
with regard, then, to Christ’s Body that the Father saith: “Sit Thou at
My right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool.”

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xiii-p12"></span>104. If, again, you seek to pervert
the sense of these words, “I will make Thine enemies Thy footstool,” I
answer that the Father also bringeth to the Son such as the Son raiseth
up and quickeneth. For “No man,” saith Christ, “can come to Me, except
the Father, Which hath sent Me, draw him, and I will raise him up at the
last day.” <span id="fr_2054"></span>[2055](#fn_2054.md) And you say that
the Son of God is subject <span id="page_238">p. 238</span> <span
id="iv.iv.iv.xiii-Page_238"></span>by reason of weakness—the Son, to
Whom the Father bringeth men that He may raise them up in the last day.
Seemeth this in your eyes to be subjection, I pray you, where the
kingdom is prepared for the Father, and the Father bringeth to the Son
and there is no place for perversion of words, since the Son giveth the
kingdom to the Father, and none is preferred before Him? <span
id="fr_2055"></span>[2056](#fn_2055.md) For inasmuch as the Father
rendereth to the Son, and the Son, again, to the Father, here are plain
proofs of love and regard: seeing that They so render, the One to the
Other, that neither He Who receiveth obtaineth as it were what was
another’s, nor He That rendereth loseth.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xiii-p15"></span>105. Moreover, the sitting at the
right hand is no preferment, nor doth that at the left hand betoken
dishonour, for there are no degrees in the Godhead, Which is bound by no
limits of space or time, which are the weights and measures of our puny
human minds. There is no difference of love, nothing that divideth the
Unity.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xiii-p16"></span>106. But wherefore roam so far
afield? Thou hast looked upon all around thee, thou hast seen the Judge,
thou hast remarked the angels proclaiming Him. *They* praise, and *thou*
revilest Him! Dominations and powers fall down before Him—thou speakest
evil of His Name! All His Saints adore Him, but the Son of God adores
not, nor the Holy Spirit. The seraphim say: “Holy, Holy, Holy!” <span
id="fr_2056"></span>[2057](#fn_2056.md)

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xiii-p18"></span>107. What meaneth this threefold
utterance of the same name “Holy”? If thrice repeated, why is it but one
act of praise? If one act of praise, why a threefold repetition? Why the
threefold repetition, unless that the Father and the Son and the Holy
Spirit are one in holiness? The seraph spake the name, not once, lest he
should exclude the Son; not twice, lest he should pass by the Holy
Spirit; not four times, lest he should conjoin created beings \[in the
praise of the Creator\]. Furthermore, to show that the Godhead of the
Trinity is One, he, after the threefold “Holy,” added in the singular
number “the Lord God of Sabaoth.” Holy, therefore, is the Father, holy
the Son, holy likewise the Spirit of God, and therefore is the Trinity
adored, but adores not, and is praised, but praises not. As for me, I
will rather believe as the seraphim, and adore after the manner of all
the principalities and powers of heaven.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xiii-p14"></span> This prerogative—viz. of sitting at

[Next: Chapter XIII. The wicked and dishonourable opinions held by
Arians, Sabellians, and Manichæans as concerning their Judge are shortly
refuted. Christ's remonstrances regarding the rest of His adversaries
being set forth, St. Ambrose expresses a hope of milder judgment for
himself.](2100218.md)
