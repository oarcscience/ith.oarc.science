#### <span id="iv.i.ii.xv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XV.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xv-p1"></span>Those who are dissatisfied with the fact
that the good receive evil, and the evil good, are shown by the example
of Lazarus, and on the authority of Paul, that punishments and rewards
are reserved for a future life.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xv-p2"></span>57. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.ii.xv-p2.1"></span>We</span> have fully discussed two
questions; and this discussion, as we think, has not turned out quite
unfavourably for us. A third question yet remains; it is this: Why do
sinners have abundance of wealth and riches, and fare sumptuously, and
have no grief or sorrow; whilst the upright are in want, and are
punished by the loss of wives or children? Now, that parable in the
Gospel ought to satisfy persons like these; <span
id="fr_97"></span>[98](#fn_97.md) for the rich man was clothed in purple
and fine linen, and dined sumptuously every day; but the beggar, full of
sores, used to gather the crumbs of his table. After the death of <span
id="page_11">p. 11</span> <span id="iv.i.ii.xv-Page_11"></span>the two,
however, the beggar was in Abraham’s bosom in rest; the rich man was in
torment. Is it not plain from this that rewards and punishments
according to deserts await one after death?

<span id="iv.i.ii.xv-p4"></span>58. And surely this is but right. For in
a contest there is much labour needed—and after the contest victory
falls to some, to others disgrace. Is the palm ever given or the crown
granted before the course is finished? Paul writes well; He says: “I
have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the
faith; henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness,
which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day; and not
to me only, but unto all them also that love His appearing.” <span
id="fr_98"></span>[99](#fn_98.md) “In that day,” he says, He will give
it—not here. Here he fought, in labours, in dangers, in shipwrecks, like
a good wrestler; for he knew how that “through much tribulation we must
enter into the kingdom of God.” <span id="fr_99"></span>[100](#fn_99.md)
Therefore no one can receive a reward, unless he has striven lawfully;
nor is the victory a glorious one, unless the contest also has been
toilsome.

[Next: Chapter XVI. To confirm what has been said above about rewards
and punishments, he adds that it is not strange if there is no reward
reserved for some in the future; for they do not labour here nor
struggle. He goes on to say also that for this reason temporal goods are
granted to these persons, so that they may have no excuse
whatever.](2100028.md)
