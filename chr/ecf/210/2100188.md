<span id="iv.iv.iii.vi"></span>

#### <span id="iv.iv.iii.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.vi-p1"></span>*The various blasphemies uttered by
the Arians against Christ are cited. Before these are replied to, the
orthodox* <span id="fr_1737"></span>[1738](#fn_1737.md) *are admonished to
beware of the captious arguments of philosophers, forasmuch as in these
especially did the heretics put their trust.*

<span id="iv.iv.iii.vi-p3"></span>34. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.iii.vi-p3.1"></span>Now</span> let us consider the disputings
of the Arians concerning the Son of God.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.vi-p4"></span>35. They say that the Son of God is
unlike His Father. To say this of a man would be an insult. <span
id="fr_1738"></span>[1739](#fn_1738.md)

<span id="iv.iv.iii.vi-p6"></span>36. They say that the Son of God had a
beginning in time, <span id="fr_1739"></span>[1740](#fn_1739.md) whereas He
Himself is the source and ordainer of time and all that therein
is. <span id="fr_1740"></span>[1741](#fn_1740.md) We are men, and we would
not be limited to time. We began to exist once, and we believe that we
shall have a timeless existence. We desire after immortality—how, then,
can we deny the eternity of God’s Son, Whom God declares to be eternal
by nature, not by grace?

<span id="iv.iv.iii.vi-p9"></span>37. They say that He was
created. <span id="fr_1741"></span>[1742](#fn_1741.md) But who would reckon
an author with his works, and have him seem to be what he has himself
made?

<span id="iv.iv.iii.vi-p11"></span>38. They deny His goodness. <span
id="fr_1742"></span>[1743](#fn_1742.md) Their blaspheming is its own
condemnation, and so cannot hope for pardon.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.vi-p13"></span>39. They deny that He is truly Son of
God, they deny His omnipotence, in that whilst they admit that all
things are made by the ministry of the Son, they attribute the original
source of their being to the power of God. But what is power, save
perfection of nature? <span id="fr_1743"></span>[1744](#fn_1743.md)

<span id="iv.iv.iii.vi-p15"></span>40. Furthermore, the Arians deny that
in <span id="page_207">p. 207</span> <span
id="iv.iv.iii.vi-Page_207"></span>Godhead He is One with the
Father. <span id="fr_1744"></span>[1745](#fn_1744.md) Let them annul the
Gospel, then, and silence the voice of Christ. For Christ Himself has
said: “I and the Father are one.” <span
id="fr_1745"></span>[1746](#fn_1745.md) It is not I who say this: Christ
has said it. Is He a deceiver, that He should lie? <span
id="fr_1746"></span>[1747](#fn_1746.md) Is He unrighteous, that He should
claim to be what He never was? But of these matters we will deal
severally, at greater length, in their proper place.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.vi-p19"></span>41. Seeing, then, that the heretic
says that Christ is unlike His Father, and seeks to maintain this by
force of subtle disputation, we must cite the Scripture: “Take heed that
no man make spoil of you by philosophy and vain deceit, according to the
tradition of men, and after the rudiments of this world, not according
to Christ; for in Him dwelleth all the fulness of Godhead in bodily
shape.” <span id="fr_1747"></span>[1748](#fn_1747.md)

<span id="iv.iv.iii.vi-p21"></span>42. For they store up all the
strength of their poisons in dialetical disputation, which by the
judgment of philosophers is defined as having no power to establish
aught, and aiming only at destruction. <span
id="fr_1748"></span>[1749](#fn_1748.md) But it was not by dialectic that it
pleased God to save His people; “for the kingdom of God consisteth in
simplicity of faith, not in wordy contention.” <span
id="fr_1749"></span>[1750](#fn_1749.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1737"></span>[206:1738](2100188.htm#fr_1737.md) <span
id="iv.iv.iii.vi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iv.iii.vi-p2"></span> In the original *Catholic, i.e.*
“Catholics.” Heresies might become widespread—the Arian heresy, indeed,
counted numerous adherents in the fourth, fifth, and sixth centuries—but
they took their rise in some member or other of the ecclesiastical body,
in some one of the many local churches which together made up the one
œcumenical church. On the other hand, the primitive teaching, received
from the apostolic age, had been delivered without differen*c*e in every
place to which it had penetrated. It was acknowledged and established
before sects and heresies; its original was divine, theirs only human;
it rested on the rock of Christ’s authority, speaking through His
apostles, whilst they were built on the sands of preeminence in
sophistry and captious interpretation; it was for all times and places,
therefore, but they were only for a season. In this belief those who
clave to the teaching of the apostles claimed for themselves the name of
“Catholics,” and for the œcumenical church of which they were members
that of “Catholic and Apostolic.” To avoid any misunderstanding, I have
used the term “orthodox,” which will stand very well for “Catholic,”
inasmuch as “the right faith” is for all, without difference, to hold—in
a word, universal, or, as it is in Greek, <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iv.iii.vi-p2.1"></span>καθ᾽ ὅλου</span> (whence <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.iv.iii.vi-p2.2"></span>καθολικός</span>,
*Catholicus,* Catholic).

<span id="fn_1738"></span>[206:1739](2100188.htm#fr_1738.md) <span
id="iv.iv.iii.vi-p4.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iv.iii.vi-p5"></span> It would constitute an insult, as
suggesting that the man was a bastard, or supposititious.

<span id="fn_1739"></span>[206:1740](2100188.htm#fr_1739.md) <span
id="iv.iv.iii.vi-p6.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iv.iii.vi-p7"></span> Thus the Arians were anathematized by
the Nicene Council as “those who say that there was a time when the Son
of God was not.”

<span id="fn_1740"></span>[206:1741](2100188.htm#fr_1740.md) <span
id="iv.iv.iii.vi-p7.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iv.iii.vi-p8"></span> The original was: “*Cum conditor ipse
sit temporum,*” which, rendered more closely word for word, is, “whereas
He Himself is the ordainer of times,” or “ages.” The Latin *tempora* is
the equivalent of the Greek <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iv.iii.vi-p8.1"></span>αἰῶνες</span>, which is commonly rendered
“worlds” in the A.V. of the New Testament, *e.g.* [Heb.
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#002.md), [Rom.
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#002.md), [1 Cor.
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#020.md), [1 Cor.
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#006.md), [2 Cor.
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#004.md), [Gal.
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#004.md), [2 Tim.
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#010.md)<span
id="iv.iv.iii.vi-p8.2"></span>. But <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iv.iii.vi-p8.3"></span>αἰὼν</span> also means “age”—“for ever and
ever” is the rendering of <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iv.iii.vi-p8.4"></span>εἰς αἰῶνας αἰώνων</span> (“unto ages of
ages”) or <span class="Greek"><span id="iv.iv.iii.vi-p8.5"></span>είς
τὸν αἰῶνα</span>. The term denotes the world as a complex, the parts of
which are presented to us in succession of time, from which notion is
derived its use to denote a selection of the parts so presented,
collectively termed an “age” or “time.” Another word rendered “world” in
the N.T. is <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iv.iii.vi-p8.6"></span>κόσμος</span>, which frequently occurs in
St. John; and St. Paul also has it, in conjunction with <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.iv.iii.vi-p8.7"></span>ἀιὼν</span> in [Eph.
ii. 2](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#002.md)<span
id="iv.iv.iii.vi-p8.8"></span>. “According to the course (<span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.iv.iii.vi-p8.9"></span>ἀιῶνα</span>) of this
world (<span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iv.iii.vi-p8.10"></span>κόσμου</span>).” <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.iv.iii.vi-p8.11"></span>Κόσμος</span> means
the world as an *ordered* whole, as opposed to a chaos. The use of
“world” to translate both <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iv.iii.vi-p8.12"></span>κόσμος</span> and <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.iv.iii.vi-p8.13"></span>αἰὼν</span> may be
justified on the ground that we cannot think of time void of objects and
events, whilst, on the other hand, we know not—at least, have never
observed—any objects and events not in time. For us “time” is a
necessary form of thought.

<span id="fn_1741"></span>[206:1742](2100188.htm#fr_1741.md) <span
id="iv.iv.iii.vi-p9.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iv.iii.vi-p10"></span> The Arians asserted that the Son had
no existence before He was begotten and that He was “formed out of
nothing” or “out of things non-existent;” *i.e.* that He owed His
existence to the Father’s absolute *fiat,* just as much as the light
([Gen. i. 3](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#003.md)<span
id="iv.iv.iii.vi-p10.1"></span>). Furthermore, the Son’s will was
mutable; He might have fallen like Satan. The Father, foreseeing that
the Son would *not* fall, bestowed on Him the titles of “Son” and
“Logos.”

<span id="fn_1742"></span>[206:1743](2100188.htm#fr_1742.md) <span
id="iv.iv.iii.vi-p11.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iv.iii.vi-p12"></span> Arius’ arguments against believing
in Christ as the Almighty Power of God were based on the N.T. records of
Christ’s agony and prayer in view of death, which he thought must imply,
not only changeableness of will, but also limitation of power. Had
Christ been omnipotent, like the Father, He would have had no fears for
Himself, but would rather have imparted strength to others.

<span id="fn_1743"></span>[206:1744](2100188.htm#fr_1743.md) <span
id="iv.iv.iii.vi-p13.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iv.iii.vi-p14"></span> Arius’ teaching on this head appears
to be fairly enough represented by Athanasius: “When God, being purposed
to establish created Nature, saw that it could not bear the immediate
touch of the Father’s hand, and His operation, He in the first place
made and created a single Being only, and called Him ‘Son’ and ‘Logos’
to the end that by His intermediate ministry all things might henceforth
be brought into existence.” *Contra Arianos*, *Oratio* II. § 24.

<span id="fn_1744"></span>[207:1745](2100188.htm#fr_1744.md) <span
id="iv.iv.iii.vi-p15.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iv.iii.vi-p16"></span> Christ, according to the Arians, was
not truly God, though He was called God. Again, He was only so called in
virtue of communication of grace from the Father. Thus He obtained His
title and dignity, though the name of God was used, in speaking of Him
in a transference, such as we find in [Ps. lxxxii.
6](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#006.md)<span
id="iv.iv.iii.vi-p16.1"></span>; though Christ’s claim to such a title
far transcended any other.

<span id="fn_1745"></span>[207:1746](2100188.htm#fr_1745.md) <span
id="iv.iv.iii.vi-p16.2"></span>

<span id="iv.iv.iii.vi-p17"></span> S. [John x.
30](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#030.md)<span
id="iv.iv.iii.vi-p17.1"></span>.

<span id="fn_1746"></span>[207:1747](2100188.htm#fr_1746.md) <span
id="iv.iv.iii.vi-p17.2"></span>

<span id="iv.iv.iii.vi-p18"></span> [Num. xxiii.
19](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#019.md)<span
id="iv.iv.iii.vi-p18.1"></span>.

<span id="fn_1747"></span>[207:1748](2100188.htm#fr_1747.md) <span
id="iv.iv.iii.vi-p19.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iv.iii.vi-p20"></span> It would, I think, be unfair to
construe this passage into an absolute condemnation of all the results
of human activity, arrived at without any conscious dependence on what
we mean by revelation. We must remember, too, what “philosophy” was in
the world into which St. Paul was born. It was no longer the golden age
of philosophic activity—with the exception of Stoicism, there was hardly
a school which exerted any elevating moral influence. Besides, the
“philosophy” of which St. Paul was especially thinking when he wrote the
passage cited ([Col. 3:8](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#008.md),
[9](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#009.md)<span
id="iv.iv.iii.vi-p20.1"></span>) was hardly worthy of the name. It was
one of the earliest forms of Gnosticism, and among other practices
inculcated worship of angels, *i.e.* of created beings—“Thrones,
Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Powers.” See [Col.
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#016.md), [Eph.
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#020.md)<span
id="iv.iv.iii.vi-p20.2"></span>. Such “philosophies,” falsely so-called,
would tend to bring philosophy in general into disfavour with the
teachers of the Church. Yet we find Eusebius, in the fourth century,
calling the Faith “the true philosophy” (*H. E.* IV. 8). The adoption of
the term to denote what St. Luke called “the way” ([Acts xix.
23](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#023.md)<span
id="iv.iv.iii.vi-p20.3"></span>) appears to have been due to the action
of apologists like Justin Martyr, who set themselves to meet the wise of
this world with their own weapons, on their own ground.

<span id="fn_1748"></span>[207:1749](2100188.htm#fr_1748.md) <span
id="iv.iv.iii.vi-p21.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iv.iii.vi-p22"></span> The original conception of
Dialectic, as exhibited, for instance, in Plato’s *Republic,* hardly
answers to this. According to Plato, the aim of Dialectic, so far from
being destructive, was distinctly edifying. The Dialectic method, as its
name implies, was one which took the external form of question and
answer. It had a definite, positive object, viz., the attainment by
force of pure reason to the clear vision of the Absolute Good, the
ultimate cause of knowledge and existence. The sphere of Dialectic was
pure reason, then, and its object the ultimate truth of things.
(*Republic,* VII. p. 532.) The method which St. Ambrose here calls
“Dialectic” would have been more correctly entitled “Elenchus.”

[Next: Chapter VI. By way of leading up to his proof that Christ is not
different from the Father, St. Ambrose cites the more famous leaders of
the Arian party, and explains how little their witness agrees, and shows
what defence the Scriptures provide against them.](2100189.md)
