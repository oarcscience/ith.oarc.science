#### <span id="iv.i.iv.xix-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIX.

<span id="iv.i.iv.xix-p1"></span>The crime committed by the inhabitants
of Gibeah against the wife of a certain Levite is related, and from the
vengeance taken it is inferred how the idea of virtue must have filled
the heart of those people of old.

<span id="iv.i.iv.xix-p2"></span>110. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.iv.xix-p2.1"></span>What</span> regard for virtue our
forefathers had to avenge by a war the wrongs of one woman which had
been brought on her by her violation at the hands of profligate men!
Nay, when the people were conquered, they vowed that they would not give
their daughters in marriage to the tribe of Benjamin! That tribe had
remained without hope of posterity, had they not received leave of
necessity to use deceit. And this permission does not seem to fail in
giving fitting punishment for violation, since they were only allowed to
enter on a union by a rape, and not through the sacrament of marriage.
And indeed it was right that they who had broken another’s intercourse
should themselves lose their marriage rites.

<span id="iv.i.iv.xix-p3"></span>111. How full of pitiful traits is this
story! A man, it says, <span id="fr_733"></span>[734](#fn_733) a Levite,
had taken to himself a wife, who I suppose was called a concubine from
the word “concubitus.” She some time afterwards, as is wont to happen,
offended at certain things, betook herself to her father, and was with
him four months. Then her husband arose and went to the house of his
father-in-law, to reconcile himself with his wife, to win her back and
take her home again. The woman ran to meet him and brought her husband
into her father’s house.

<span id="iv.i.iv.xix-p5"></span>112. The maiden’s <span
id="fr_734"></span>[735](#fn_734) father rejoiced and went to meet him,
and the man stayed with him three days, and they ate and rested. On the
next day the Levite arose at daybreak, but was detained by his
father-in-law, that he might not so quickly lose the pleasure of his
company. Again on the next and the third day the maiden’s father did not
suffer his son-in-law to start, until their joy and mutual regard was
complete. But on the seventh day, when it was already drawing to a
close, after a pleasant meal, having urged the approach of the coming
night, so as to make him think he ought to sleep amongst friends rather
than strangers, he <span id="page_86">p. 86</span> <span
id="iv.i.iv.xix-Page_86"></span>was unable to keep him, and so let him
go together with his daughter.

<span id="iv.i.iv.xix-p7"></span>113. When some little progress <span
id="fr_735"></span>[736](#fn_735) was made, though night was threatening
to come on, and they were close by the town of the Jebusites, on the
slave’s request that his lord should turn aside there, he refused,
because it was not a city of the children of Israel. He meant to get as
far as Gibeah, which was inhabited by the people of the tribe of
Benjamin. But when they arrived there was no one to receive them with
hospitality, except a stranger of advanced age—When he had looked upon
them he asked the Levite: Whither goest thou and whence dost thou come?
On his answering that he was travelling and was making for Mount Ephraim
and that there was no one to take him in, the old man offered him
hospitality and prepared a meal.

<span id="iv.i.iv.xix-p9"></span>114. And when they were satisfied <span
id="fr_736"></span>[737](#fn_736) and the tables were removed, vile men
rushed up and surrounded the house. Then the old man offered these
wicked men his daughter, a virgin, and the concubine with whom she
shared her bed, only that violence might not be inflicted on his guest.
But when reason did no good and violence prevailed, the Levite parted
from his wife, and they knew her and abused her all that night. Overcome
by this cruelty or by grief at her wrong, she fell at the door of their
host where her husband had entered, and gave up the ghost, with the last
effort of her life guarding the feelings of a good wife so as to
preserve for her husband at least her mortal remains.

<span id="iv.i.iv.xix-p11"></span>115. When this became known <span
id="fr_737"></span>[738](#fn_737) (to be brief) almost all the people of
Israel broke out into war. The war remained doubtful with an uncertain
issue, but in the third engagement the people of Benjamin were delivered
to the people of Israel, <span id="fr_738"></span>[739](#fn_738) and
being condemned by the divine judgment paid the penalty for their
profligacy. The sentence, further, <span
id="fr_739"></span>[740](#fn_739) was that none of the people of the
fathers should give his daughter in marriage to them. This was confirmed
by a solemn oath. But relenting at having laid so hard a sentence on
their brethren, they moderated their severity so as to give them in
marriage those maidens that had lost their parents, whose fathers had
been slain for their sins, or to give them the means of finding a wife
by a raid. Because of the villainy of so foul a deed, they who have
violated another’s marriage rights were shown to be unworthy to ask for
marriage. But for fear that one tribe might perish from the people, they
connived at the deceit.

<span id="iv.i.iv.xix-p15"></span>116. What great regard our forefathers
had for virtue is shown by the fact that forty thousand men drew the
sword against their brethren of the tribe of Benjamin in their desire to
avenge the wrong done to modesty, for they would not endure the
violation of chastity. And so in that war on both sides there fell
sixty-five thousand warriors, whilst their cities were burnt. And when
at first the people of Israel were defeated, yet unmoved by fear at the
reverses of the war, they disregarded the sorrow the avenging of
chastity cost them. They rushed into the battle ready to wash out with
their own blood the stains of the crime that had been committed.
