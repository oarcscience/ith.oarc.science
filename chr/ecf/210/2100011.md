### <span id="iv.i.i-p0.1"></span>Introduction.

<span id="iv.i.i-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.i-p1.1"></span>St. Ambrose</span>, esteeming very highly the
dignity of the ministerial office, was most desirous that the clergy of
his diocese should live worthily of their high vocation, and be good and
profitable examples to the people. Consequently he undertook the
following treatise, setting forth the duties of the clergy, and taking
as a model the treatise of Cicero, *De Officiis.*

<span id="iv.i.i-p2"></span>The writer says that his object is to
impress upon those whom he has ordained the lessons which he had
previously taught them. <span id="fr_24"></span>[25](#fn_24.md) Like
Cicero, he treats of that which is right, becoming, or honourable
\[*decorum*\], and what is expedient \[*utile*\]; <span
id="fr_25"></span>[26](#fn_25.md) but with reference not to this life but
to that which is to come, teaching in the first book that which is
becoming or honourable; in the second, what is expedient; and in the
third, considering both in conjunction.

<span id="iv.i.i-p5"></span>In the first book he divides duties into
“ordinary,” or the way of the commandments, binding upon all alike; and
“perfect,” which consist in following the counsels. After treating then
of some elementary duties, such as those towards parents and elders, he
touches upon the two principles which lead the mind, reason and
appetite, and shows that what is becoming consists in thinking of good
and right things, and in the subjection of the appetite to reason, <span
id="fr_26"></span>[27](#fn_26.md) and supplies certain rules and examples,
ending with a discussion on the four Cardinal Virtues, Prudence,
Justice, Fortitude, and Temperance.

<span id="iv.i.i-p7"></span>In the second book, passing from what is
becoming to what is expedient, he points out that we can only measure
what is really expedient by reference to eternal life, in contradiction
to the errors of heathen philosophers, and shows that what is expedient
consists in the knowledge of God and in good living. Incidentally he
shows that what is becoming is really that which is expedient, and ends
the book with several chapters of practical considerations.

<span id="iv.i.i-p8"></span>In the third book he treats of duties of
perfection, and lays down as a rule that in everything we must inquire
what is expedient, not for individuals, but for many or for all. Nothing
is to be striven after which is not becoming; to this everything must
give place, not only expediency but even friendship and life itself. By
many examples he then proves how holy men have sought after what was
becoming, and have thereby secured what was expedient.

<span id="iv.i.i-p9"></span>The object of St. Ambrose in basing his
treatise on the lines of that of Cicero would seem to have been the
confutation of some of the false principles of heathenism, and to show
how much higher Christian morality is than that of the Gentiles. The
treatise was probably composed about <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.i-p9.1"></span>a.d.</span> 391.
