<span id="iv.i.ii.xxv"></span>

#### <span id="iv.i.ii.xxv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXV.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxv-p1"></span>A reason is given why this book did not
open with a discussion of the above-mentioned virtues. It is also
concisely pointed out that the same virtues existed in the ancient
fathers.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxv-p2"></span>116. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.ii.xxv-p2.1"></span>Perhaps</span>, as the different classes of
duties are derived from these four virtues, some one may say that they
ought to have been described first of all. But it would have been
artificial to have given a definition of duty at the outset, <span
id="fr_164"></span>[165](#fn_164.md) and then to have gone on to divide it
up into various classes. We have avoided what is artificial, and have
put forward the examples of the fathers of old. These certainly offer us
no uncertainty as regards our understanding them, and give us no room
for subtlety in our discussion of them. Let the life of the fathers,
then, be for us a mirror of virtue, not a mere collection of shrewd and
clever acts. Let us show reverence in following them, not mere
cleverness in discussing them.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxv-p4"></span>117. Prudence held the first place in
holy Abraham. For of him the Scriptures say: “Abraham believed God, and
that was counted to him for righteousness;” <span
id="fr_165"></span>[166](#fn_165.md) for no one is prudent who knows not
God. Again: “The fool hath said, There is no God;” <span
id="fr_166"></span>[167](#fn_166.md) for a wise man would not say so. How
is he wise who looks not for his Maker, but says to a stone: “Thou art
my father”? <span id="fr_167"></span>[168](#fn_167.md) Who says to the
devil as the Manichæan does: “Thou art the author of my being”? <span
id="fr_168"></span>[169](#fn_168.md) How is Arius <span
id="fr_169"></span>[170](#fn_169.md) wise, who prefers an imperfect and
inferior creator to one who is a true and perfect one? How can
Marcion <span id="fr_170"></span>[171](#fn_170.md) or Eunomius <span
id="fr_171"></span>[172](#fn_171.md) be wise, who prefer to have an evil
rather than a good God? And how can he be wise who does not fear his
God? For: “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.” <span
id="fr_172"></span>[173](#fn_172.md) Elsewhere, too, it stands: “The wise
turn not aside from the mouth of the Lord, but come near Him in their
confession of His greatness.” <span id="fr_173"></span>[174](#fn_173.md) So
when the Scripture says: “It was counted to him for righteousness,” that
brought to him the grace of another virtue.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxv-p14"></span>118. The chief amongst ourselves have
stated that prudence lies in the knowledge of the truth. But who of them
all excelled Abraham, David, or Solomon in this? Then they go on to say
that justice has regard to the whole community of the human race. So
David said: “He hath dispersed abroad and given to the poor, His
righteousness remaineth for ever.” <span
id="fr_174"></span>[175](#fn_174.md) The just man has pity, the just man
lends. The whole world of riches lies at the feet of the wise and the
just. The just man regards what belongs to all as his own, and his own
as common property. The man just accuses himself rather than others. For
he is just who does not spare himself, and who does not suffer his
secret actions to be concealed. See now how just Abraham was! In his old
age he begat a son according to promise, and when the Lord demanded him
for sacrifice he did not think he ought to refuse him, although he was
his only son. <span id="fr_175"></span>[176](#fn_175.md)

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxv-p17"></span>119. Note here all these four virtues
in one act. It was wise to believe God, and not to put love for his son
before the commands of his Creator. It was just to give back <span
id="page_21">p. 21</span> <span id="iv.i.ii.xxv-Page_21"></span>what had
been received. It was brave to restrain natural feelings by reason. The
father led the victim; the son asked where it was: the father’s feelings
were hardly tried, but were not overcome. The son said again: “My
father,” and thus pierced his father’s heart, though without weakening
his devotion to God. The fourth virtue, temperance, too, was there.
Being just he preserved due measure in his piety, and order in all he
had to carry out. And so in bringing what was needed for the sacrifice,
in lighting the fire, in binding his son, in drawing the knife, in
performing the sacrifice in due order; thus he merited as his reward
that he might keep his son.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxv-p18"></span>120. Is there greater wisdom than holy
Jacob’s, who saw God face to face and won a blessing? <span
id="fr_176"></span>[177](#fn_176.md) Can there be higher justice than his
in dividing with his brother what he had acquired, and offering it as a
gift? <span id="fr_177"></span>[178](#fn_177.md) What greater fortitude
than his in striving with God? <span id="fr_178"></span>[179](#fn_178.md)
What moderation so true as his, who acted with such moderation as
regards time and place, as to prefer to hide his daughter’s shame rather
than to avenge himself? <span id="fr_179"></span>[180](#fn_179.md) For
being set in the midst of foes, he thought it better to gain their
affections than to concentrate their hate on himself.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxv-p23"></span>121. How wise also was Noah, who built
the whole of the ark! <span id="fr_180"></span>[181](#fn_180.md) How just
again! For he alone, preserved of all to be the father of the human
race, was made a survivor of past generations, and the author of one to
come; he was born, too, rather for the world and the universe than for
himself. How brave he was to overcome the flood! how temperate to endure
it! When he had entered the ark, with what moderation he passed the
time! When he sent forth the raven and the dove, when he received them
on their return, when he took the opportunity of leaving the ark, with
what moderation did he make use of these occasions!

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxv-p8"></span> Manes, the founder of Manicheism,
living about <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.ii.xxv-p8.1"></span>a.d.</span> 250. He taught that there were
two original principles absolutely opposed one to the other. On the one
side God, from Whom nothing but good can go forth; on the other original
evil—the author of all matter—which therefore is evil too. Man was
formed by this evil spirit. For, whilst man’s soul is an emanation from
the good God, man’s body in which the soul is imprisoned was framed of
material elements. Hence the Manichæan is here represented addressing
the devil as his father, the author of his earthly existence.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxv-p9"></span> The father of Arianism, born <span

condemned at the Council of Nicæa <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.ii.xxv-p9.2"></span>a.d.</span> 325. He denied that Christ was
“of one substance with the Father;” but held Him to be a kind of
secondary God, created out of nothing before the world. But he
considered Him to be the creator of the world.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxv-p10"></span> Marcion flourished between the years
<span class="sc"><span id="iv.i.ii.xxv-p10.1"></span>a.d.</span>
140–190. He also taught the existence of more than one Principle, and
held that man was created by an inferior Being.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxv-p11"></span> Eunomius was the leader of the
extreme Arian party, flourishing c. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.ii.xxv-p11.1"></span>a.d.</span> 360. He maintained the
absolute unlikeness of the Son to the Father not only in substance but
even in will. Hence his party were called *Anomœans* (<span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.i.ii.xxv-p11.2"></span>ανόμοιος</span>,
unlike). In baptizing they also applied no water to the lower part of
the body, asserting that it was created by an evil spirit, thus with
Marcion recognizing the dual Principle. Theodoret, who is the authority
for this latter and some other charges against the Eunomians, says,
however, that he is speaking from hearsay, not of his own knowledge.

[Next: Chapter XXVI. In investigating the truth the philosophers have
broken through their own rules. Moses, however, showed himself more wise
than they. The greater the dignity of wisdom, the more earnestly must we
strive to gain it. Nature herself urges us all to do this.](2100038.md)
