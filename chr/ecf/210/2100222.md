------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Next: Chapter I. Statement of the reasons wherefore the matters,
treated of shortly in the two former, are dealt with more at length in
the three later books. Defence of the employment of fables, which is
supported by the example of Holy Writ, wherein are found various figures
of poetic fable, in particular the Sirens, which are figures of sensual
pleasures, and which Christians ought to be taught to avoid, by the
words of Paul and the deeds of Christ.](2100223)
