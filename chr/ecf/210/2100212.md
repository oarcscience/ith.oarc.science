<span id="iv.iv.iv.viii"></span>

#### <span id="iv.iv.iv.viii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VII.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.viii-p1"></span>The resolution of the difficulty set
forth for consideration is again taken in hand. Christ truly and really
took upon Him a human will and affections, the source of whatsoever was
not in agreement with His Godhead, and which must be therefore referred
to the fact that He was at the same time both God and man.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.viii-p2"></span>52. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.iv.viii-p2.1"></span>There</span> is, therefore, unity of will
where there is unity of working; for in God His will issues straightway
in actual effect. But the will of God is one, and the human will
another. Further, to show that life is the object of human will, because
we fear death, whilst the passion of Christ depended on the Divine Will,
that He should suffer for us, the Lord said, when Peter would have
detained Him from suffering: “Thou savourest not of the things which be
of God, but the things which be of men.” <span
id="fr_1969"></span>[1970](#fn_1969.md)

<span id="iv.iv.iv.viii-p4"></span>53. My will, therefore, He took to
Himself, my grief. In confidence I call it grief, because I preach His
Cross. Mine is the will which He called His own, for as man He bore my
grief, as man He spake, and therefore said, “Not as I will, but as Thou
wilt.” Mine was the grief, and mine the heaviness with which He bore it,
for no man exults when at the point to die. With me and for me He
suffers, for me He is sad, for me He is heavy. In my stead, therefore,
and in me He grieved Who had no cause to grieve for Himself.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.viii-p5"></span>54. Not Thy wounds, but mine, hurt
Thee, Lord Jesus; not Thy death, but our weakness, even as the Prophet
saith: “For He is afflicted for our sakes” <span
id="fr_1970"></span>[1971](#fn_1970.md) —and we, Lord, esteemed Thee
afflicted, when Thou grievedst not for Thyself, but for me.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.viii-p7"></span>55. And what wonder if He grieved for
all, Who wept for one? What wonder if, in the hour of death, He is heavy
for all, Who wept when at the point to raise Lazarus from the dead?
*Then,* indeed, He was moved by a loving sister’s tears, for they
touched His human heart,—here by secret grief He brought it to pass
that, even as His death made an end of death, and His stripes healed our
scars, so also His sorrow took away our sorrow. <span
id="fr_1971"></span>[1972](#fn_1971.md)

<span id="iv.iv.iv.viii-p9"></span>56. As being man, therefore, He
doubts; as man He is amazed. Neither His power nor His Godhead is
amazed, but His soul; He is amazed by consequence of having taken human
infirmity upon Him. Seeing, then, that He took upon Himself a soul He
also took the affections of a soul, <span
id="fr_1972"></span>[1973](#fn_1972.md) for God could not have been
distressed or have died in respect of His being God. Finally, He cried:
“My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?” <span
id="fr_1973"></span>[1974](#fn_1973.md) As being man, therefore, He speaks,
bearing with Him my terrors, for when we are in the midst of dangers we
think ourself abandoned by God. As man, therefore, He is distressed, as
man He weeps, as man He is crucified.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.viii-p12"></span>57. For so hath the Apostle Paul
likewise said: “Because they have crucified the flesh of Christ.” <span
id="fr_1974"></span>[1975](#fn_1974.md) And again the Apostle Peter saith:
“Christ having suffered according to the flesh.” <span
id="fr_1975"></span>[1976](#fn_1975.md) It was the flesh, therefore, that
suffered; the Godhead above secure from death; to suffering His body
yielded, after the law of human nature; can the Godhead die, then, if
the soul cannot? “Fear not them,” said our Lord, “which can kill the
body, but cannot kill the soul.” <span
id="fr_1976"></span>[1977](#fn_1976.md) If the soul, then, cannot be
killed, how can the Godhead?

<span id="iv.iv.iv.viii-p16"></span>58. When we read, then, that the
Lord of glory was crucified, let us not suppose that He was crucified as
in His glory. <span id="fr_1977"></span>[1978](#fn_1977.md) It is because
He Who is God is also man, God by virtue of His Divinity, and by taking
upon Him of the flesh, the man Christ Jesus, that the Lord of glory is
said to have been crucified; for, possessing both natures, that is,
<span id="page_231">p. 231</span> <span
id="iv.iv.iv.viii-Page_231"></span>the human and the divine, He endured
the Passion in His humanity, in order that without distinction He Who
suffered should be called both Lord of glory and Son of man, even as it
is written: “Who descended from heaven.” <span

<span id="iv.iv.iv.viii-p8"></span> It is a very beautiful doctrine of
the Fathers that Christ submitted to the conditions and experiences of
our life in order to restore and sanctify and endue them with the virtue
of His merits. Hence Thomassini, after the Fathers, thus discourses in
his treatise on the Incarnation: “The Fathers have been careful to
attribute to the Word of God” (incarnate) “not only the physical
parts—body and soul—but even the smallest and most particular things:
grief, fear, tears; and all the emotions: conception, birth, babyhood;
all the stages of life and growth: hunger, thirst, fatigue, and sadness,
in order that a remedy might be applied at every place where sin had
crept in, and that, as death had corrupted all, so upon all might the
water of life be sprinkled.” Gregory of Nazianzus strikingly observes
(*Or.* 37): “Perchance indeed He sleeps, in order to bless sleep:
perchance, again, He is weary, in order to sanctify weariness: and
perchance weeps, to give dignity to tears.” Hurter *ad loc.,* who also
cites Cyril of Alexandria on S. [John xii.
27](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#027.md)<span
id="iv.iv.iv.viii-p8.1"></span>—“You will find each and every human
experience duly represented in Christ, and that the affections of the
flesh were called out into energy, not that, as in us, they might gain
the upper hand, but that, by the might of the Word dwelling in flesh,
they might be tamed and kept within bounds, and our nature transformed
into a better state.”

[Next: Chapter VIII. Christ's saying, “The Father is greater than I,” is
explained in accordance with the principle just established. Other like
sayings are expounded in like fashion. Our Lord cannot, as touching His
Godhead, be called inferior to the Father.](2100213.md)
