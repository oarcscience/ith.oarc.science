#### <span id="iv.i.iv.viii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VIII.

<span id="iv.i.iv.viii-p1"></span>That those who put what is virtuous
before what is useful are acceptable to God is shown by the example of
Joshua, Caleb, and the other spies.

<span id="iv.i.iv.viii-p2"></span>53. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.iv.viii-p2.1"></span>When</span> could our fathers ever have
thrown off their servitude, unless they had believed that it was not
only shameful but even useless to serve the king of Egypt?

<span id="iv.i.iv.viii-p3"></span>54. Joshua, also, and Caleb, when sent
to spy out the land, brought back the news that the land was indeed
rich, but that it was inhabited by very fierce nations. <span
id="fr_648"></span>[649](#fn_648.md) The people, terrified at the thought
of war, refused to take possession of their land. Joshua and Caleb, who
had been sent as spies, tried to persuade them that the land was
fruitful. They thought it unseemly to give way before the heathen; they
chose rather to be stoned, which is what the people threatened, than to
recede from their virtuous standpoint. The others kept dissuading, the
people exclaimed against it, saying they would have to fight against
cruel and terrible nations; that they would fall in battle, and their
wives and children would be left for a prey. <span
id="fr_649"></span>[650](#fn_649.md)

<span id="iv.i.iv.viii-p6"></span>55. The anger of the Lord burst
forth, <span id="fr_650"></span>[651](#fn_650.md) so that He would kill
all, but at the prayer of Moses He softened His judgment and put off His
vengeance, knowing that He had already sufficiently punished those who
were faithless, even if He spared them meanwhile and did not slay the
unbelievers. However, He said <span id="fr_651"></span>[652](#fn_651.md)
they should not come to that land which they had refused, as a penalty
for their unbelief; but their children and wives, who had not murmured,
and who, owing to their sex and age, were guiltless, should receive the
promised inheritance of that land. So the bodies of those of twenty
years old and upwards fell in the desert. The punishment of the rest was
put aside. But they who had gone up with Joshua, and had thought fit to
dissuade the people, died forthwith of a great plague. <span
id="fr_652"></span>[653](#fn_652.md) Joshua and Caleb <span
id="fr_653"></span>[654](#fn_653.md) entered the land of promise together
with those who were innocent by reason of age or sex.

<span id="iv.i.iv.viii-p11"></span>56. The better part, therefore,
preferred glory to safety; the worse part safety to virtue. But the
divine judgment approved those who thought virtue was above what is
useful, whilst it condemned those who preferred what seemed more in
accordance with safety than with what is virtuous.

[Next: Chapter IX. Cheating and dishonest ways of making money are
utterly unfit for clerics whose duty is to serve all. They ought never
to be involved in a money affair, unless it is one affecting a man's
life. For them the example of David is given, that they should injure
none, even when provoked; also the death of Naboth, to keep them from
preferring life to virtue.](2100103.md)
