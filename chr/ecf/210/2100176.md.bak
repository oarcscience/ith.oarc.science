### <span id="iv.iii.i-p0.1"></span>Introduction.

<span id="iv.iii.i-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.i-p1.1"></span>Besides</span> his elder sister Marcellina,
who received the veil at the hands of Pope Liberius, at Christmas
\[perh. 353 <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.i-p1.2"></span>a.d.</span>\], St. Ambrose had also a brother
named Satyrus, to which name, in the epitaph on him ascribed to the
bishop, is added Uranius. This is probably, however, merely in reference
to his translation from earth to heaven.

<span id="iv.iii.i-p2"></span>Satyrus had in his earlier years, as well
as St. Ambrose, practised as an advocate, and held office. But when his
brother was appointed Bishop of Milan, Satyrus at once gave up his
appointment, and devoted his life to managing St. Ambrose’s secular
affairs, that nothing might distract him from his episcopal duties.
After however, a few short years of devotion to this task, he succumbed
to a severe illness October 17, <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.i-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> 379.

<span id="iv.iii.i-p3"></span>The grief of St. Ambrose at the loss of
his absolutely like-minded brother was intense, and to it we owe the
exquisite discourse delivered at the funeral of Satyrus, and the second,
on the resurrection, delivered a week later.

<span id="iv.iii.i-p4"></span>St. Ambrose subsequently revised these two
addresses, and they have come down to us as the “two books of St.
Ambrose on the decease of Satyrus,” some <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.i-p4.1"></span>mss.</span> adding, “and the resurrection of
the dead.”

<span id="iv.iii.i-p5"></span>The epitaph on Satyrus, said to be by St.
Ambrose, is as follows:

<span id="iv.iii.i-p6"></span>Uranio Satyro supremum frater honorem

<span id="iv.iii.i-p7"></span>Martyris <span
id="fr_1453"></span>[1454](#fn_1453.md) ad lævam detulit Ambrosius.

<span id="iv.iii.i-p9"></span>Hæc meriti merces, ut sacri sanguinis
humor

<span id="iv.iii.i-p10"></span>Finitimas penetrans adluat exuvias.
