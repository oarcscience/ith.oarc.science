#### <span id="iv.ii.iii.ix-p0.1"></span>Chapter VIII.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.ix-p1"></span>*St. Ambrose examines and refutes the
heretical argument that because God is said to be glorified in the
Spirit, and not with the Spirit, the Holy Spirit is therefore inferior
to the Father. He shows that the particle* in *can be also used of the
Son and even of the Father, and that on the other hand* with *may be
said of creatures without any infringement on the prerogatives of the
Godhead; and that in reality these prepositions simply imply the
connection of the Three Divine Persons.*

<span id="iv.ii.iii.ix-p2"></span>70. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.ii.iii.ix-p2.1"></span>But</span> what wonder is it if foolish
men question about words, when they do so even about syllables? For some
think that a distinction should be made and that God should be praised
*in* the Spirit, but not *with* the Spirit, and consider that the
greatness of the Godhead is to be estimated from one syllable or some
custom, arguing that if they consider that God should be glorified *in*
the Spirit, they point to some office of the Holy Spirit, but that if
they say that God receives glory or power *with* the Spirit, they seem
to imply some association and communion of the Father, the Son, and the
Holy Spirit.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.ix-p3"></span>71. But who can separate what is
in<span id="page_124">p. 124</span> <span
id="iv.ii.iii.ix-Page_124"></span>capable of separation? who can divide
that association which Christ shows to be inseparable? “Go,” says He,
“baptize all nations in the Name of the Father and of the Son and of the
Holy Spirit.” <span id="fr_1094"></span>[1095](#fn_1094.md) Has He changed
either a word or a syllable here concerning the Father or the Son or the
Holy Spirit? Certainly not. But He says, in the Name of the Father and
of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. The expression is the same for the
Spirit as for the Father and for Himself. From which is inferred not any
office of the Holy Spirit, but rather a sharing of honour or of working
when we say “in the Spirit.”

<span id="iv.ii.iii.ix-p5"></span>72. Consider, too, that this opinion
of yours tends to the injury of the Father and the Son, for the latter
did not say, “with the Name of the Father and of the Son, and of the
Holy Spirit,” but in the Name, and yet not any office but the power of
the Trinity is expressed in this syllable,

<span id="iv.ii.iii.ix-p6"></span>73. Lastly, that you may know that it
is not a syllable which prejudices faith, but faith which commends a
syllable, Paul also speaks in Christ. Christ is not less, because Paul
spoke in Christ, as you find: “We speak before God in Christ.” <span
id="fr_1095"></span>[1096](#fn_1095.md) As, then, the Apostle says that we
speak in Christ, so, too, is that which we speak in the Spirit; as the
Apostle himself said: “No man saith Lord Jesus, except in the Holy
Spirit.” <span id="fr_1096"></span>[1097](#fn_1096.md) So, then, in this
place not any subjection of the Holy Spirit, but a connection of grace
is signified.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.ix-p9"></span>74. And that you may know that
distinction does not depend upon a syllable, he says also in another
place: “And these indeed were you, but ye are washed, but ye are
sanctified, but ye are justified in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ,
and in the Spirit of our God.” <span
id="fr_1097"></span>[1098](#fn_1097.md) How many instances of this I can
bring forward. For it is written: “Ye are all one in Christ
Jesus,” <span id="fr_1098"></span>[1099](#fn_1098.md) and elsewhere: “To
those sanctified in Christ Jesus,” <span
id="fr_1099"></span>[1100](#fn_1099.md) and again: “That we might be the
righteousness of God in Him,” <span id="fr_1100"></span>[1101](#fn_1100.md)
and in another place: “Should fall from the chastity which is in Christ
Jesus.” <span id="fr_1101"></span>[1102](#fn_1101.md)

<span id="iv.ii.iii.ix-p15"></span>75. But what am I doing? For while I
say that like things are written of the Son as of the Spirit, I am
rather leading on to this, not that because it is written of the Son,
therefore it would appear to be reverently written of the Holy Spirit,
but that because the same is written of the Spirit, therefore men allege
that the Son’s honour is lessened because of the Spirit. For say they,
Is it written of God the Father?

<span id="iv.ii.iii.ix-p16"></span>76. But let them learn that it is
also said of God the Father: “In the Lord I will praise the word;” <span
id="fr_1102"></span>[1103](#fn_1102.md) and elsewhere: “In God we will do
mighty deeds;” <span id="fr_1103"></span>[1104](#fn_1103.md) and “My
remembrance shall be ever in Thee;” <span
id="fr_1104"></span>[1105](#fn_1104.md) and “In Thy Name will we
rejoice;” <span id="fr_1105"></span>[1106](#fn_1105.md) and again in
another place: “That his deeds may be manifested, that they are wrought
in God;” <span id="fr_1106"></span>[1107](#fn_1106.md) and Paul: “In God
Who created all things;” <span id="fr_1107"></span>[1108](#fn_1107.md) and
again: “Paul and Silvanus and Timotheus to the Church of the
Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ;” <span
id="fr_1108"></span>[1109](#fn_1108.md) and in the Gospel: “I in the Father
and the Father in Me,” and “the Father that dwelleth in Me.” <span
id="fr_1109"></span>[1110](#fn_1109.md) It is also written: “He that
glorieth let him glory in the Lord;” <span
id="fr_1110"></span>[1111](#fn_1110.md) and in another place: “Our life is
hid with Christ in God.” <span id="fr_1111"></span>[1112](#fn_1111.md) Did
he here ascribe more to the Son than to the Father in saying that we are
with Christ in God? or does our state avail more than the grace of the
Spirit, so that we can be with Christ and the Holy Spirit cannot? And
when Christ wills to be with us, as He Himself said: “Father, I will
that they whom Thou hast given Me be with Me where I am,” <span
id="fr_1112"></span>[1113](#fn_1112.md) would He disdain to be with the
Spirit? For it is written: “Ye coming together and my spirit with the
power of the Lord Jesus.” <span id="fr_1113"></span>[1114](#fn_1113.md) Do
we then come together in the power of the Lord, and dare to say that the
Lord Jesus would not be willing to come together with the Spirit Who
does not disdain to come together with us?

<span id="iv.ii.iii.ix-p29"></span>77. So the Apostle thinks that it
makes no difference which particle you use. For each is a conjunctive
particle, and conjunction does not cause separation, for if it divided
it would not be called a conjunction.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.ix-p30"></span>78. What, then, moves you to say that
to God the Father or to His Christ there is glory, life, greatness, or
power, *in* the Holy Spirit, and to refuse to say *with* the Holy
Spirit? Is it that you are afraid of seeming to join the Spirit with the
Father and the Son? But hear what is written of the Spirit: “For the law
of the Spirit is life in Christ Jesus.” <span
id="fr_1114"></span>[1115](#fn_1114.md) And in another place God the Father
says: “They shall worship Thee, and in Thee they shall make
supplication.” <span id="fr_1115"></span>[1116](#fn_1115.md) God the Father
says that we ought to pray in Christ; and do you think that it is any
derogation to the Spirit if the glory of Christ is said to be in Him?

<span id="iv.ii.iii.ix-p33"></span><span id="page_125">p. 125</span>
<span id="iv.ii.iii.ix-Page_125"></span>79. Hear that what you are
afraid to acknowledge of the Spirit, the Apostle did not fear to claim
for himself; for he says: “To be dissolved and to be with Christ is much
better.” <span id="fr_1116"></span>[1117](#fn_1116.md) Do you deny that the
Spirit, through Whom the Apostle was made worthy of being with Christ,
is with Christ?

<span id="iv.ii.iii.ix-p35"></span>80. What, then, is the reason that
you prefer saying that God or Christ is glorified in the Spirit rather
than with the Spirit? Is it because if you say in the Spirit, the Spirit
is declared to be less than Christ? Although your making the Lord
greater or less is a matter which can be refuted, yet since we read,
“For Christ was made sin for us, that we might be the righteousness of
God in Him,” <span id="fr_1117"></span>[1118](#fn_1117.md) He is found
chiefest in Whom we are found most low. So, too, elsewhere you read,
“For in Him all things consist,” <span
id="fr_1118"></span>[1119](#fn_1118.md) that is, in His power. And the
things which consist in Him cannot be compared to Him, because they
receive from His power the substance whereby they consist.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.ix-p38"></span>81. Do you then understand that God
so reigns in the Spirit that the power of the Spirit, as a kind of
source of substance, imparts to God the origin of His rule? But this is
impious. And so our predecessors <span
id="fr_1119"></span>[1120](#fn_1119.md) spoke of the unity of power of the
Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, when they said that the glory of
Christ was with the Spirit, that they might declare their inseparable
connection.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.ix-p40"></span>82. For how is the Holy Spirit
separated from the Son, since “the Spirit Himself beareth witness with
our spirit that we are sons of God, and if sons, also heirs, heirs,
indeed, of God and joint-heirs with Christ.” <span
id="fr_1120"></span>[1121](#fn_1120.md) Who, then, is so foolish as to wish
to dissever the eternal conjunction of the Spirit and Christ, when the
Spirit by Whom we are made joint-heirs with Christ conjoins even what is
severed.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.ix-p42"></span>83. “If so be,” he says, “we suffer
with Him, that we may be also glorified together.” <span
id="fr_1121"></span>[1122](#fn_1121.md) If we then shall be glorified
together with Christ through the Spirit, how do we refuse to admit that
the Spirit Himself is glorified together with Christ? Do we dissociate
the life of Christ and of the Holy Spirit when the Spirit says that we
shall live together with the Son of God? For the Apostle says: “If we be
dead with Christ we believe that we shall also live with Him;” and then
again: “For if we suffer with Him we shall also live with Him, and not
only shall we live with Him, but shall be also glorified with Him, and
not only be glorified but shall also reign with Him.” <span
id="fr_1122"></span>[1123](#fn_1122.md)

<span id="iv.ii.iii.ix-p45"></span>84. No division, then, is implied in
those particles, for each is a particle of conjunction. And lastly, we
often find in holy Scripture the one inserted and the other understood,
as it is written: “I will enter into Thy house in whole
burnt-offerings,” <span id="fr_1123"></span>[1124](#fn_1123.md) that is,
“with whole burnt-offerings;” and in another place: “He brought them
forth in silver and gold,” <span id="fr_1124"></span>[1125](#fn_1124.md)
that is, “with silver and gold.” And elsewhere the Psalmist says: “Wilt
Thou not go forth with us in our hosts?” <span
id="fr_1125"></span>[1126](#fn_1125.md) for that which is really meant,
“with our hosts.” So, then, in the use of the expression no lessening of
honour can be implied, and nothing ought to be deduced derogatory to the
honour of the Godhead, it is necessary that with the heart man should
believe unto righteousness, and that out of the faith of the heart
confession should be made in the mouth unto salvation. But they who
believe not with the heart spread what is derogatory with their mouth.

[Next: Chapter IX. A passage of St. Paul abused by heretics, to prove a
distinction between the Divine Persons, is explained, and it is proved
that the whole passage can be rightly said of each Person, though it
refers specially to the Son. It is then proved that each member of the
passage is applicable to each Person, and as to say, of Him are all
things is applicable to the Father, so may all things are through Him
and in Him also be said of Him.](2100147.md)
