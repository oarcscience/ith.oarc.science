<span id="iv.iv.iii.xvi"></span>

#### <span id="iv.iv.iii.xvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XV.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xvi-p1"></span>*An explanation of* <span
id="iv.iv.iii.xvi-p1.1"></span>*[Acts ii.
36](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#036.md)<span
id="iv.iv.iii.xvi-p1.2"></span>* *and* <span
id="iv.iv.iii.xvi-p1.3"></span>*[Proverbs viii.
22](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#022.md)<span
id="iv.iv.iii.xvi-p1.4"></span>, which are shown to refer properly to
Christ’s manhood alone.*

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xvi-p2"></span>95. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.iii.xvi-p2.1"></span>To</span> no purpose, then, is the
heretics’ customary citation of the Scripture, that “God made Him both
Lord and Christ.” Let these ignorant persons read the whole passage, and
understand it. For thus it is written. “God made this Jesus, Whom ye
crucified, both Lord and Christ.” <span
id="fr_1842"></span>[1843](#fn_1842.md) It was not the Godhead, but the
flesh, that was crucified. This, indeed, was possible, because the flesh
allowed of being crucified. It follows not, then, that the Son of God is
a created being.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xvi-p4"></span>96. Let us despatch, then, that
passage also, which they do use to misrepresent,—let them learn what is
the sense of the words, “The Lord created Me.” <span
id="fr_1843"></span>[1844](#fn_1843.md) It is not “the Father created,” but
“the Lord created Me.” The flesh acknowledgeth its Lord, praise
declareth the Father: our created nature confesseth the first, loveth,
knoweth the latter. Who, then, cannot but perceive that these words
announce the Incarnation? Thus the Son speaketh of Himself as created in
respect of that wherein he witnesseth to Himself as being man, when He
says, “Why seek ye to kill Me, a *man*, Who have told you the truth?” He
speaketh of His Manhood, wherein He was crucified, and died, and was
buried.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xvi-p7"></span>97. Furthermore, there is no doubt
but that the writer set down as past that which was to come; for this is
the usage of prophecy, that things to come are spoken of as though they
were already present or past. For example, in the twenty-first <span
id="fr_1844"></span>[1845](#fn_1844.md) psalm you have read: “Fat bulls (of
Bashan) have beset me,” and again: <span
id="fr_1845"></span>[1846](#fn_1845.md) “They parted My garments among
them.” This the Evangelist showeth to have been spoken prophetically of
the time of the Passion, for to God the things that are to come are
present, and for Him Who foreknoweth all things, they are as though they
were past and over; as it is written, “Who hath made the things that are
to be.” <span id="fr_1846"></span>[1847](#fn_1846.md)

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xvi-p11"></span>98. It is no wonder that He should
declare His place to have been set fast before all worlds, seeing that
the Scripture tells us that He was foreordained before the times and
ages. The following passage discovers how the words in question present
themselves as a true prophecy of the Incarnation: “Wisdom hath built her
an house, and set up seven pillars to support it, and she hath slain her
victims. She hath mingled her wine in the bowl, and made ready her
table, and sent her servants, calling men together with a mighty voice
of proclamation, saying: ‘He who is simple, let him turn in to
me.’” <span id="fr_1847"></span>[1848](#fn_1847.md) Do we not see, in the
Gospel, that all these things were fulfilled after the Incarnation, in
that Christ disclosed the mysteries of the Holy Supper, sent forth His
apostles, and cried with a loud voice, saying, “If any man thirst, let
him come to Me and drink.” <span id="fr_1848"></span>[1849](#fn_1848.md)
That which followeth, then, answereth to that which went before, and we
behold the whole story of the Incarnation set forth in brief by
prophecy.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xvi-p14"></span>99. Many other passages might
readily be seen to be prophecies of this sort concerning the
Incarnation, but I will not delay over books, lest the treatise appear
too wordy

me,” and the Vulgate likewise *Dominus possedit me.* The Greek versions
of the passage appear to have presented two readings, which might
exhibit little difference to the eye in a closely-written <span

difference in meaning was by no means small. The two readings were: (1)
<span class="Greek"><span id="iv.iv.iii.xvi-p6.4"></span>ἔκτισέ
με</span> and (2) <span class="Greek"><span

“founded,” “established,” or “created” me, the latter “acquired me.” The

would be <span class="Greek"><span

[Next: Chapter XVI. The Arians blaspheme Christ, if by the words
“created” and “begotten” they mean and understand one and the same
thing. If, however, they regard the words as distinct in meaning, they
must not speak of Him, of Whom they have read that He was begotten, as
if He were a created being. This rule is upheld by the witness of St.
Paul, who, professing himself a servant of Christ, forbade worship of a
created being. God being a substance pure and uncompounded, there is no
created nature in Him; furthermore, the Son is not to be degraded to the
level of things created, seeing that in Him the Father is well
pleased.](2100199.md)
