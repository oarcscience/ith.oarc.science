<span id="iv.iv.iii.xx"></span>

#### <span id="iv.iv.iii.xx-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIX.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xx-p1"></span>Arius is charged with the first of the
above-mentioned errors, and refuted by the testimony of St. John. The
miserable death of the Heresiarch is described, and the rest of his
blasphemous errors are one by one examined and disproved.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xx-p2"></span>123. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.iii.xx-p2.1"></span>Arius</span>, then, says: “There was a
time when the Son of God existed not,” but Scripture saith: “He was,”
not that “He was not.” Furthermore, St. John has written: “In the
beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
The same was in the beginning with God.” <span
id="fr_1876"></span>[1877](#fn_1876.md) Observe how often the verb “was”
appears, whereas “was not” is nowhere found. Whom, then, are we to
believe?—St. John, who lay on Christ’s bosom, or Arius, wallowing amid
the outgush of his very bowels?—so wallowing that we might understand
how Arius in his teaching showed himself like unto Judas, being visited
with like punishment.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xx-p4"></span>124. For Arius’ bowels also gushed
out—decency forbids to say where—and so he burst asunder in the midst,
falling headlong, and besmirching those foul lips wherewith he had
denied Christ. He was rent, even as the Apostle Peter said of Judas,
because he “bought a field with the price of evil-doing, and falling
headlong he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed
out.” <span id="fr_1877"></span>[1878](#fn_1877.md) It was no chance manner
of death, seeing that like wickedness was visited with like punishment,
to the end that those who denied and betrayed the same Lord might
likewise undergo the same torment.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xx-p6"></span>125. Let us pass on to further points.
Arius says: “Before He was born, the Son of God was not,” but the
Scripture saith that all things are maintained in existence by the Son’s
office. How, then, could He, Who existed not, bestow existence upon
others? Again, when the blasphemer uses the words “when” and “before,”
he certainly uses words which are marks of time. How, then, do the
Arians deny that time was ere the Son was, and yet will have things
created in time to exist before the Son, seeing that the very words,
“when,” “before,” and “did not exist once,” announce the idea of time?

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xx-p7"></span>126. Arius says that the Son of God
came into being out of nought. How, then, is He Son of God—how was He
begotten from the womb of the Father—how do we read of Him as the Word
spoken of the heart’s abundance, save to the end that we should believe
that He came forth, as it is written, from the Father’s inmost,
unapproachable sanctuary? Now a son is so called either by means of
adoption or by nature, as we are called sons by means of adoption. <span
id="fr_1878"></span>[1879](#fn_1878.md) Christ is the Son of God by virtue
of His real and abiding nature. How, then, can He, Who out of nothing
fashioned all things, be Himself created out of nothing?

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xx-p9"></span>127. He who knows not whence the Son
is hath not the Son. The Jews therefore had not the Son, for they knew
not whence He was. Wherefore the Lord said to them: “Ye know not whence
I came;” <span id="fr_1879"></span>[1880](#fn_1879.md) and again: “Ye
neither have found out Who I am, nor know My Father,” for he who denies
that the Son is of the Father knows not the Father, of Whom the Son is;
and again, he knows not the Son, because he knows not the Father.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xx-p11"></span>128. Arius says: “\[The Son is\] of
another Substance.” But what other substance is exalted to equality with
the Son of God, so that simply in virtue thereof He is Son of God? Or
what right have the Arians for censuring us because we speak, in Greek,
of the <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iv.iii.xx-p11.1"></span>οὐσία</span>, or in Latin, of the
*Substantia* of God, when they themselves, in saying that the Son of God
is of another “Substance,” assert a divine *Substantia*.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xx-p12"></span>129. Howbeit, should they desire to
dispute the use of the words “divine Substance” or “divine Nature,” they
shall easily be refuted, for Holy Writ oft-times hath spoken of <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.iv.iii.xx-p12.1"></span>οὐσία</span> in
Greek, or *Substantia* <span id="page_222">p. 222</span> <span
id="iv.iv.iii.xx-Page_222"></span>in Latin, and St. Peter, as we read,
would have us become partakers in the divine Nature. But if they will
have it that the Son is of another “Substance,” they with their own lips
confute themselves, in that they both acknowledge the term “Substance,”
whereof they are so afraid, and rank the Son on a level with the
creatures above which they feign to exalt Him.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xx-p13"></span>130. Arius calls the Son of God a
creature, but “not as the rest of the creatures.” Yet what created being
is not different from another? Man is not as angel, earth is not as
heaven, the sun is not as water, nor light as darkness. Arius’
preference, therefore, is empty—he hath but disguised with a sorry dye
his deceitful blasphemies, in order to take the foolish.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xx-p14"></span>131. Arius declares that the Son of
God may change and swerve. How, then, is He God if He is changeable,
seeing that He Himself hath said: “I am, I am, and I change not”? <span

[Next: Chapter XX. St. Ambrose declares his desire that some angel would
fly to him to purify him, as once the Seraph did to Isaiah--nay more,
that Christ Himself would come to him, to the Emperor, and to his
readers, and finally prays that Gratian and the rest of the faithful may
be exalted by the power and spell of the Lord's Cup, which he describes
in mystic language.](2100203.md)
