#### <span id="iv.iv.v.xvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVII.

<span id="iv.iv.v.xvii-p1"></span>*An objection based on St. Stephen’s
vision of the Lord* standing *is disposed of, and from the prayers of
the same saint, addressed to the Son of God, the equality of the Son
with the Father is shown.*

<span id="iv.iv.v.xvii-p2"></span>137. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.v.xvii-p2.1"></span>There</span> is just one place, in which
Stephen hath said that he saw the Lord Jesus *standing* at the right
hand of God. <span id="fr_2325"></span>[2326](#fn_2325) Learn now the
import of these words, that you may not use them to raise a question
upon. Why (you would ask) do we read every where else of the Son as
sitting at the right hand of God, but in one place of His standing? He
sits as Judge of quick and <span id="page_262">p. 262</span> <span
id="iv.iv.v.xvii-Page_262"></span>dead; He stands as His people’s
Advocate. He stood, then, as a Priest, whilst He was offering to His
Father the sacrifice of a good martyr; He stood, as the Umpire, to
bestow, as it were, upon a good wrestler the prize of so mighty a
contest.

<span id="iv.iv.v.xvii-p4"></span>138. Receive thou also the Spirit of
God, that thou mayest discern those things, even as Stephen received the
Spirit; and thou mayest say, as the martyr said: “Behold, I see the
heavens opened, and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of
God.” <span id="fr_2326"></span>[2327](#fn_2326) He who hath the heavens
opened to him, seeth Jesus at the right hand of God: he whose soul’s eye
is closed, seeth not Jesus at the right hand of God. Let us, then,
confess Jesus at God’s right hand, that to us also the heavens may be
opened. They who confess otherwise close the gates of heaven against
themselves.

<span id="iv.iv.v.xvii-p6"></span>139. But if any urge in objection that
the *Son* was standing, let them show upon this passage that the Father
was seated, for though Stephen said that the Son of Man was standing,
still he did not further say here that the Father was sitting.

<span id="iv.iv.v.xvii-p7"></span>140. Howbeit, to make it more
abundantly clear and known that the standing implied no dishonour, but
rather sovereignty, Stephen prayed to the Son, being desirous to commend
himself the more to the Father, saying: “Lord Jesu, receive my
spirit.” <span id="fr_2327"></span>[2328](#fn_2327) Again, to show that
the sovereignty of the Father and of the Son is one and the same, he
prayed again, saying, “Lord, lay not this sin to their charge.” <span
id="fr_2328"></span>[2329](#fn_2328) These are the words that the Lord,
in His own Passion, speaks to the Father, as the Son of Man—these the
words of Stephen’s prayer, in his own martyrdom to the Son of God. When
the same grace is sought of both the Father and the Son, the same power
is affirmed of each.

<span id="iv.iv.v.xvii-p10"></span>141. Otherwise, if our opponents will
have it that Stephen addressed himself to the Father, let them consider
what, on their own showing, they affirm. We indeed are unmoved by their
arguments; howbeit, let them, to whom the letter and sequence is all
important, take notice that the *first* petition is addressed to the
Son. Now we, even on their understanding of the passage, prove from it
the unity of the Father’s and the Son’s majesty; for when the Son is
addressed in prayer as well as the Father, the equality which the prayer
assigns points to unity in action. But if they will not allow that the
Son was addressed with the title “Lord,” we see that they do indeed seek
to deny that He is Lord.

<span id="iv.iv.v.xvii-p11"></span>142. Seeing, however, that so great a
martyr’s crown has been brought forth, let us abate the eagerness of
disputation, and bring to-day’s discourse to a close. Let us sing the
praises of the holy martyr, as is fitting always after a mighty
conflict—the martyr bleeding indeed from the enemy’s blows, but rewarded
with the crown bestowed by Christ.
