#### <span id="iv.iv.vii.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.v-p1"></span>It is objected by heretics that Christ
offered worship to His Father. But instead it is shown that this must be
referred to His humanity, as is clear from an examination of the
passage. However, it also offers fresh witness to His Godhead, as we
often see it happening in other actions that Christ did.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.v-p2"></span>48. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.vii.v-p2.1"></span>But</span> if any one were to say that the
Son worships God the Father, because it is written, “Ye worship ye know
not what, we know what we worship,” <span
id="fr_2576"></span>[2577](#fn_2576.md) let him consider when it was said,
and to whom, and to whose wishes it was in answer.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.v-p4"></span>49. In the earlier verses of this
chapter it was stated, not without reason, that Jesus, being weary with
the journey, was sitting down, and that He asked a woman of Samaria to
give Him drink; <span id="fr_2577"></span>[2578](#fn_2577.md) for He spoke
as man; for as God He could neither be weary nor thirst.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.v-p6"></span>50. So when this woman addressed Him as
a Jew, and thought Him a prophet, He answers her, as a Jew who
spiritually taught the mysteries of the Law: “Ye worship ye know not
what, we know what we worship.” “We,” He says; for He joined Himself
with men. But how is He joined with men, but according to the flesh? And
to show that He answered as being incarnate, He added: “for salvation is
of the Jews.” <span id="fr_2578"></span>[2579](#fn_2578.md)

<span id="iv.iv.vii.v-p8"></span>51. But immediately after this He put
aside His human feelings, saying: “But the hour cometh, and now is, when
the true worshippers shall worship the Father.” <span
id="fr_2579"></span>[2580](#fn_2579.md) He said not: “We shall worship.”
This He would certainly have said, if He had a share in our obedience.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.v-p10"></span>52. And when we read that Mary
worshipped Him, <span id="fr_2580"></span>[2581](#fn_2580.md) we ought to
learn that it is not possible for Him under the same nature both to
worship as a servant, and to be worshipped as Lord; but rather that as
man He is said to worship among men, and that as Lord He is worshipped
by His servants.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.v-p12"></span>53. Many things therefore we read and
believe, in the light of the sacrament of the Incarnation. But even in
the very feelings of our human nature we may behold the Divine Majesty.
Jesus is wearied with His journey, that He may refresh the weary; He
desires to drink, when about to give spiritual drink to the thirsty; He
was hungry, when about to supply the food of salvation to the hungry; He
dies, to live again; He is buried, to rise again; He hangs upon the
dreadful tree, to strengthen those in dread; He veils the heaven with
thick darkness, that He may give light; He makes the earth to shake,
that He may make it strong; He rouses the sea, that He may calm it; He
opens the tombs of the dead, that He may show they are the homes of the
living; He is made of a Virgin, that men may believe He is born of God;
He feigns not to know, that He may make the ignorant to know; as a Jew
He is said to worship, that the Son may be worshipped as true God.

[Next: Chapter V. Ambrose answers those who press the words of the Lord
to the mother of Zebedee's children, by saying that they were spoken out
of kindness, because Christ was unwilling to cause her grief. Ample
reason for such tenderness is brought forward. The Lord would rather
leave the granting of that request to the Father, than declare it to be
impossible. This answer of Christ's, however, is not to His detriment,
as is shown both by His very words, and also by comparing them with
other passages.](2100259.md)
