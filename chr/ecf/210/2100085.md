#### <span id="iv.i.iii.xxii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXII.

<span id="iv.i.iii.xxii-p1"></span>We must observe a right standard
between too great mildness and excessive harshness. They who endeavour
to creep into the hearts of others by a false show of mildness gain
nothing substantial or lasting. This the example of Absalom plainly
enough shows.

<span id="iv.i.iii.xxii-p2"></span>112. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.iii.xxii-p2.1"></span>Moreover</span>, due measure befits even
our words and instructions, that it may not seem as though there was
either too great mildness or too much harshness. Many prefer to be too
mild, so as to appear to be good. But it is certain that nothing feigned
or false can bear the form of true virtue; nay, it cannot even last. At
first it flour<span id="page_61">p. 61</span> <span
id="iv.i.iii.xxii-Page_61"></span>ishes, then, as time goes on, like a
floweret it fades and passes away, but what is true and sincere has a
deep root. <span id="fr_543"></span>[544](#fn_543.md)

<span id="iv.i.iii.xxii-p4"></span>113. To prove by examples our
assertion that what is feigned cannot last, but flourishing just for a
time quickly fails, we will take one example of pretence and falsehood
from that family, from which we have already drawn so many examples to
show their growth in virtue.

<span id="iv.i.iii.xxii-p5"></span>114. Absalom was King David’s son,
known for his beauty, of splendid appearance and in the heyday of youth;
so that no other such man as he was found in Israel. <span
id="fr_544"></span>[545](#fn_544.md) He was without a blemish from the sole
of his foot to the crown of his head. He had for himself a chariot and
horses and fifty men to run before him. He rose at early dawn and stood
before the gate in the way, and whoever he knew to be seeking the
judgment of the king, he called to himself, saying: “From what city art
thou?” And he answered: “I thy servant am of one of the tribes of
Israel.” And Absalom answered: “Thy words are good and right. Is there
none given thee by the king to hear thee? Who will make me a judge? And
whosoever will come unto me, that hath need of judgment, I will give him
justice.” With such words he cajoled them. And when they came to make
obeisance to him, stretching forth his hand he took hold of them and
kissed them. <span id="fr_545"></span>[546](#fn_545.md) So he turned the
hearts of all to himself. For flattery of this sort quickly finds its
way to touch the very depths of the heart.

<span id="iv.i.iii.xxii-p8"></span>115. Those spoilt and ambitious men
chose what for a time seemed an honour to them, and was pleasing and
enjoyable. But whilst that delay took place, which the prophet, <span
id="fr_546"></span>[547](#fn_546.md) being prudent above all, thought ought
to intervene, they could no longer hold out or bear it. Then David
having no doubt about the victory commended his son to those who went
out to fight, so that they should spare him. <span
id="fr_547"></span>[548](#fn_547.md) He would not engage in the battle
himself lest he should seem to be taking up arms against one who was
still his son, though attempting to destroy his father.

<span id="iv.i.iii.xxii-p11"></span>116. It is clear, then, that those
things are lasting and sound, which are true and grow out of a sincere
and not a false heart. Those, however, which are brought about by
pretence and adulation can never last for long.
