<span id="iv.iv.iii.ii"></span>

#### <span id="iv.iv.iii.ii-p0.1"></span>Chapter I.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.ii-p1"></span>*The author distinguishes the faith
from the errors of Pagans,* <span id="fr_1669"></span>[1670](#fn_1669.md)
*Jews, and Heretics, and after explaining the significance of the names
“God” and “Lord,” shows clearly the difference of Persons in Unity of
Essence.* <span id="fr_1670"></span>[1671](#fn_1670.md) * In dividing the
Essence, the Arians not only bring in the doctrine of three Gods, but
even overthrow the dominion of the Trinity.*

<span id="iv.iv.iii.ii-p4"></span>6. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.iii.ii-p4.1"></span>Now</span> this is the declaration of our
Faith, that we say that God is One, neither dividing His Son from Him,
as do the heathen, <span id="fr_1671"></span>[1672](#fn_1671.md) nor
denying, with the Jews, that He was begotten of the Father before all
worlds, <span id="fr_1672"></span>[1673](#fn_1672.md) and afterwards born
of the Virgin; nor yet, like Sabellius, <span
id="fr_1673"></span>[1674](#fn_1673.md) confounding the Father with the
Word, and so maintaining that Father and Son are one and the same
Person; nor again, as doth Photinus, <span
id="fr_1674"></span>[1675](#fn_1674.md) holding that the Son first came
into existence in the Virgin’s womb: nor believing, with Arius, <span
id="fr_1675"></span>[1676](#fn_1675.md) in a number of diverse
Powers, <span id="fr_1676"></span>[1677](#fn_1676.md) and so, like the
benighted heathen, making out more than one God. For it is written:
“Hear, O Israel: the Lord thy God is one God.” <span
id="fr_1677"></span>[1678](#fn_1677.md)

<span id="iv.iv.iii.ii-p14"></span>7. For God and Lord is a name of
majesty, a name of power, even as God Himself saith: “The Lord is My
name,” <span id="fr_1678"></span>[1679](#fn_1678.md) and as in another
place the prophet declareth: “The Lord Almighty is His name.” <span
id="fr_1679"></span>[1680](#fn_1679.md) God is He, therefore, and Lord,
either because His rule is over all, or because He beholdeth all things,
and is feared by all, without difference. <span
id="fr_1680"></span>[1681](#fn_1680.md)

<span id="iv.iv.iii.ii-p18"></span>8. If, then, God is One, one is the
name, <span id="page_203">p. 203</span> <span
id="iv.iv.iii.ii-Page_203"></span>one is the power, of the Trinity.
Christ Himself, indeed, saith: “Go ye, baptize the nations in the name
of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.” <span
id="fr_1681"></span>[1682](#fn_1681.md) In the *name,* mark you, not in the
*names.*” <span id="fr_1682"></span>[1683](#fn_1682.md)

<span id="iv.iv.iii.ii-p21"></span>9. Moreover, Christ Himself saith: “I
and the Father are One.” <span id="fr_1683"></span>[1684](#fn_1683.md)
“One,” said He, that there be no separation of power and nature; but
again, “*We are,*” that you may recognize Father and Son, forasmuch as
the perfect Father is believed to have begotten the perfect Son, <span
id="fr_1684"></span>[1685](#fn_1684.md) and the Father and the Son are One,
not by confusion of Person, but by unity of nature. <span
id="fr_1685"></span>[1686](#fn_1685.md)

<span id="iv.iv.iii.ii-p25"></span>10. We say, then, that there is one
God, not two or three Gods, this being the error into which the impious
heresy of the Arians doth run with its blasphemies. For it says that
there are three Gods, in that it divides the Godhead of the Trinity;
whereas the Lord, in saying, “Go, baptize the nations in the name of the
Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,” hath shown that the
Trinity is of one power. We confess Father, Son, and Spirit,
understanding in a perfect Trinity both fulness of Divinity and unity of
power. <span id="fr_1686"></span>[1687](#fn_1686.md)

<span id="iv.iv.iii.ii-p27"></span>11. “Every kingdom divided against
itself shall quickly be overthrown,” saith the Lord. Now the kingdom of
the Trinity is not divided. If, therefore, it is not divided, it is one;
for that which is not one is divided. The Arians, however, would have
the kingdom of the Trinity to be such as may easily be overthrown, by
division against itself. But truly, seeing that it cannot be overthrown,
it is plainly undivided. For no unity is divided or rent asunder, and
therefore neither age nor corruption has any power over it. <span

<span id="iv.iv.iii.ii-p2"></span> Or “Gentiles.” The Christians
regarded themselves as placed in the world much as the Hebrews had been
planted in the midst of the “nations round about.”

<span id="fn_1670"></span>[202:1671](2100184.htm#fr_1670.md) <span
id="iv.iv.iii.ii-p2.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iv.iii.ii-p3"></span> The Latin word is *natura,* which, at
first sight, seems less abstruse and metaphysical than the Greek <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.iv.iii.ii-p3.1"></span>οὐσία</span>, or <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.iv.iii.ii-p3.2"></span>ὑ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.iv.iii.ii-p3.3"></span>πόστασις</span>, or
the Latin *essentia* and *substantia,* though it is not really so. A
man’s *natura*, nature, is what he is at and from the beginning; “change
of nature” means not an absolute change, but a reformation, a new
guidance and treatment of tendencies, passions, powers—some receiving a
precedence denied them before, others being suppressed and put in
subjection. So God’s “nature” is what He is from and to all eternity, in
Himself, unchangingly and unchangeably.

<span id="fn_1671"></span>[202:1672](2100184.htm#fr_1671.md) <span

<span id="iv.iv.iii.ii-p5"></span> Lit. “the nations”—*gentes*, <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.iv.iii.ii-p5.1"></span>τὰ ἔθνη</span>. The
Romans of the Republic used to speak of foreign peoples—especially if
subject to kings—as *gentes exteræ,* in contradistinction to the
*Populus Romanus.* St. Ambrose of course means those who still clung to
the ancient religions, who were foreigners to the commonwealth (*res
publica*) of the Church.

interprets as meaning <span class="Greek"><span

*Dialogue with Tryphon,* 61. *Tempora* answers to the Greek <span

id="iv.iv.iii.ii-p6.7"></span>

<span id="iv.iv.iii.ii-p7"></span> Sabellius was a presbyter in the
Libyan Pentapolis (Barca), who came to Rome and there ventilated his
heretical teaching, early in the third century, <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.iii.ii-p7.1"></span>a.d.</span> (about 210). He appears to
have maintained that there was no real distinction of Persons in the
Godhead. God, he said, was one individual Person: when different divine
Persons were spoken of, no more was meant than different aspects of, or
the assumption of different parts by, the same subject. Sabellius thus
started from the ordinary usages of the term <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iv.iii.ii-p7.2"></span>πρόσωπον</span> as denoting (1) a mask,
(2) a character or part in a drama. The Latin *persona* was used in the
same way. Sabellianism never counted many adherents; its professors were
called Patripassians, because their doctrine was tantamount to asserting
that God the Father was crucified.

<span id="fn_1674"></span>[202:1675](2100184.htm#fr_1674.md) <span
id="iv.iv.iii.ii-p7.3"></span>

<span id="iv.iv.iii.ii-p8"></span> Photinus was a Galatian, who became
Bishop of Sirmium (Mitrovitz in Slavonia) in the fourth century. He
taught that Jesus Christ did not exist before His mother Mary, but was
begotten of her by Joseph. The man Jesus, of a reasonable soul and human
flesh subsisting, was enlightened and guided by the influence of the
Logos, or Divine Reason, whereby He became the Son of God, preeminent
over all other prophets and teachers.

<span id="fn_1675"></span>[202:1676](2100184.htm#fr_1675.md) <span
id="iv.iv.iii.ii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iv.iii.ii-p9"></span> Arius was a presbyter of Alexandria;
the origin of his heresy, however, is, as Cardinal Newman has shown, to
be sought in Syria rather than in Egypt, in the sophistic method of the
Antiochene schools more than in the mysticism of the Alexandrian. It was
in the year 319 that Arius began to attract attention by his heterodox
teaching, which led eventually to his excommunication. He found favour,
however, with men of considerable importance in the Church, such as
Eusebius of Cæsarea in Palestine, Eusebius of Nicomedia, Athanasius of
Anazarbus, and others. The question was finally discussed in a synod of
bishops convened, on the summons of the Emperor Constantine, at Nicæa in
Bithynia. The acts of that Council condemned Arianism—notwithstanding
which, the heresy prevailed in the East till the reign of Theodosius the
Great (379–395 <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.iii.ii-p9.1"></span>a.d.</span>); and having won the
acceptance of the Goths, it was predominant in Gaul and Italy during the
fifth century, and in Spain till the Council of Toledo (589 <span
class="sc"><span id="iv.iv.iii.ii-p9.2"></span>a.d.</span>), and its
influence affected Christian thought for centuries afterwards—possibly
it is not even yet dead.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.ii-p10"></span>Arius urged the following dilemma:
“Either the Son is an original Divine Essence; if so we must acknowledge
two Gods. Or He was created, formed, begotten; if so, He is not God in
the same sense as the Father is God.” Arius himself chose the latter
alternative, which St. Ambrose regarded as a lapse into paganism, with
its “gods many and lords many,” *dii majores* and *dii minores,* and
divinities begotten of gods and goddesses.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.ii-p11"></span>Arius’s errors are summarized in the
anathema appended to the original Nicene Creed. “But those who say that
there was a time when the Son of God was not, or that He had no
existence before He was begotten, or that He was formed of things
non-existent, or who assert that the Son of God is of a different
substance or essence, or is created, mutable, or variable, these men the
Catholic and Apostolic Church of God holds accursed.”

<span id="fn_1676"></span>[202:1677](2100184.htm#fr_1676.md) <span
id="iv.iv.iii.ii-p11.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iv.iii.ii-p12"></span> Compare [Eph.
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#021.md), [Col.
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#016.md)<span
id="iv.iv.iii.ii-p12.1"></span>. Hierarchies of “Thrones, Dominations,
Princedoms, Virtues, Powers,” were characteristic features of the
Gnostic systems of the second century. The Gnostics generally thought
that the world had been created by an inferior, secondary, limitary
power, identified with the God of the Old Testament, whom they
distinguished from the true Supreme God.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.ii-p17"></span> The word <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iv.iii.ii-p17.1"></span>Θεός</span>, “God,” is derived by most
authorities from <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iv.iii.ii-p17.2"></span>θεᾶσθαι</span>, which means “to look
upon.” Here we have another derivation suggested, viz., from <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.iv.iii.ii-p17.3"></span>δέος</span>, “fear,”
on this ground that God inspires fear.—H. Neither derivation is correct.
The best perhaps is given by Herodotus (II. 52), viz., from the verb
<span class="Greek"><span id="iv.iv.iii.ii-p17.4"></span>τίθημι</span>,
to place, set, array, the idea being that God is the principal of all
order and law.

[Next: Chapter II. The Emperor is exhorted to display zeal in the Faith.
Christ's perfect Godhead is shown from the unity of will and working
which He has with the Father. The attributes of Divinity are shown to be
proper to Christ, Whose various titles prove His essential unity, with
distinction of Person. In no other way can the unity of God be
maintained.](2100185.md)
