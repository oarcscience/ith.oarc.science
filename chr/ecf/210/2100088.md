#### <span id="iv.i.iii.xxv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXV.

<span id="iv.i.iii.xxv-p1"></span>Benefits should be conferred on the
poor rather than on the rich, for these latter either think a return is
expected from them, or else they are angry at seeming to be indebted for
such an action. But the poor man makes God the debtor in his place, and
freely owns to the benefits he has received. To these remarks is added a
warning to despise riches.

<span id="iv.i.iii.xxv-p2"></span>126. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.iii.xxv-p2.1"></span>But</span> what advantage is it to thee to
show favour to a rich man? Is it that he is more ready to repay one who
loves him? <span id="fr_549"></span>[550](#fn_549.md) For we generally show
favour to those from whom we expect to receive a return of favour. But
we ought to think far more of the weak and helpless, because we hope to
receive, on behalf of him who has it not, a recompense from the Lord
Jesus, Who in the likeness of a marriage feast <span
id="fr_550"></span>[551](#fn_550.md) has given us a general representation
of virtue. By this He bids us confer benefits rather on those who cannot
give them to us in return, teaching us to bid to our feasts and meals,
not those who are rich, but those that are poor. For the rich seem to be
asked that they may prepare a banquet for us in return; the poor, as
they have nothing wherewith to make return, when they receive anything,
make the Lord to be our recompense Who has offered Himself as surety for
the poor.

<span id="iv.i.iii.xxv-p5"></span>127. In the ordinary course of things,
too, the conferring of a benefit on the poor is of more use than when it
is conferred on the rich. The rich man scorns the benefit and is ashamed
to feel indebted for a favour. Nay, moreover, whatever is offered to him
he takes as due to his merits, as though only a just debt were paid him;
or else he thinks it was but given because the giver expected a still
greater return to be made him by the rich man. So, in accepting a
kindness, the <span id="page_63">p. 63</span> <span
id="iv.i.iii.xxv-Page_63"></span>rich man, on that very ground, thinks
that he has given more than he ever received. The poor man, however,
though he has no money wherewith he can repay, at least shows his
gratitude. And herein it is certain that he returns more than he
received. For money is paid in coins, but gratitude never fails; money
grows less by payment, but gratitude fails when held back, and is
preserved when given to others. Next—a thing the rich man avoids—the
poor man owns that he feels bound by the debt. He really thinks help has
been given him, not that it has been offered in return for his honour.
He considers that his children have been again given him, that his life
is restored and his family preserved. How much better, then, is it to
confer benefits upon the good than on the ungrateful.

<span id="iv.i.iii.xxv-p6"></span>128. Wherefore the Lord said to His
disciples: “Take neither gold nor silver nor money.” <span
id="fr_551"></span>[552](#fn_551.md) Whereby as with a sickle He cuts off
the love of money that is ever growing up in human hearts. Peter also
said to the lame man, who was always carried even from his mother’s
womb: “Silver and gold have I none, but what I have give I thee. In the
Name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, arise and walk.” <span
id="fr_552"></span>[553](#fn_552.md) So he gave not money, but he gave
health. How much better it is to have health without money, than money
without health! The lame man rose; he had not hoped for that: he
received no money; though he had hoped for that. But riches are hardly
to be found among the saints of the Lord, so as to become objects of
contempt to them.

how idle a thing the possession of money is.](2100089.md)
