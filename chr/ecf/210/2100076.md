#### <span id="iv.i.iii.xiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIII.

<span id="iv.i.iii.xiii-p1"></span>The beauty of wisdom is made plain by
the divine testimony. From this he goes on to prove its connection with
the other virtues.

<span id="iv.i.iii.xiii-p2"></span>64. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.iii.xiii-p2.1"></span>Is</span> there any one who would like to
be beautiful in face and at the same time to have its charm spoilt by a
beast-like body and fearful talons? Now the form of virtues is so
wonderful and glorious, and especially the beauty of wisdom, as the
whole of the Scriptures tell us. For it is more brilliant than the sun,
and when compared with the stars far outshines any constellation. Night
takes their light away in its train, but wickedness cannot overcome
wisdom. <span id="fr_473"></span>[474](#fn_473.md)

<span id="iv.i.iii.xiii-p4"></span>65. We have spoken of its beauty, and
proved it by the witness of Scripture. It remains to show on the
authority of Scripture <span id="fr_474"></span>[475](#fn_474.md) that
there can be no fellowship between it and vice, but that it has an
inseparable union with the rest of the virtues. “It has a spirit
sagacious, undefiled, sure, holy, loving what is good, quick, that never
forbids a kindness, kind, steadfast, free from care, having all power,
overseeing all things.” And again: <span
id="fr_475"></span>[476](#fn_475.md) “She teacheth temperance and justice
and virtue.”
