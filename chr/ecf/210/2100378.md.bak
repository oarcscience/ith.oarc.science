### <span id="v.xiii-p0.1"></span>Letter LXI.

<span id="v.xiii-p1"></span>*St. Ambrose explains his absence from Milan
on the arrival of the Emperor Theodosius after his victory over
Eugenius,* <span id="fr_3642"></span>[3643](#fn_3642.md) *and after
expressing his thankfulness for that success he promises obedience to
the Emperor’s will, and while commending his piety urges him to be
merciful to the conquered.*

<span id="v.xiii-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="v.xiii-p3.1"></span>Ambrose</span>, to the Emperor Theodosius.

<span id="v.xiii-p4"></span>1. You thought, most blessed Emperor, so far
as I gathered from your letter, that I kept away from the city of Milan,
because I believed that your cause was forsaken by God. But I was not so
wanting in foresight, nor so unmindful in my absence of your virtue and
merits, as not to anticipate that the aid of Heaven would be with your
piety, with which you would rescue the Roman Empire from the cruelty of
a barbarian robber, and the dominion of an unworthy usurper.

<span id="v.xiii-p5"></span>2. I therefore made haste to return thither,
as soon as I knew that he, whom I thought it right to avoid, <span
id="fr_3643"></span>[3644](#fn_3643.md) was now gone, for I had not
deserted the Church of Milan, entrusted to me by the judgment of God,
but avoided the presence of him who had involved himself in sacrilege. I
returned, therefore, about the Calends of August, and have resided here
since that day. Here, too, O Augustus, your letter found me.

<span id="v.xiii-p7"></span>3. Thanks be to our Lord God, Who responded
to your faith and piety, and has restored the form of ancient sanctity,
suffering us to see in our time that which we wonder at in reading the
Scriptures, namely, such a presence of the divine assistance <span
id="fr_3644"></span>[3645](#fn_3644.md) in battle, that no mountain heights
delayed the course of your approach, no hostile arms were any hindrance.

<span id="v.xiii-p9"></span>4. For these mercies you think that I ought
to render thanks to the Lord our God, and being conscious of your
merits, I will do so willingly. Certainly that offering will be
acceptable to God which is offered in your name, and what a mark of
faith and devotion is this! Other emperors, immediately upon a victory,
order the erection of triumphal arches, or other monuments of their
triumphs; your Clemency prepares an offering for God, and desires that
oblation and thanksgiving should be presented by the priests to the
Lord.

<span id="v.xiii-p10"></span>5. Though I be unworthy and unequal to such
an office and the offering of such acknowledgments, yet will I describe
what I have done. I took the letter of your Piety with me to the altar.
I laid it upon the altar. I held it in my hand whilst I offered the
Sacrifice; so that your faith might speak by my voice, and the Emperor’s
letter discharge the function of the priestly oblation.

<span id="v.xiii-p11"></span>6. In truth, the Lord is propitious to the
Roman Empire, since He has chosen such a prince and father of princes,
whose virtue and power, established on such a triumphant height of
dominion, rests on such humility, that in valour he has surpassed
emperors and priests in humility. What can I wish? What can I desire?
You have everything, and therefore I will endeavour to gain the sum of
my desires. You, O Emperor, are pitiful, and of the greatest clemency.

<span id="v.xiii-p12"></span>7. And for yourself, I desire again and
again an increase of piety, than which God has given nothing more
excellent, that by your clemency the Church of God, as it delights in
the peace and tranquillity of the innocent, so, too, may rejoice in the
pardon of the guilty. Pardon especially those who have not offended
before. May the Lord preserve your Clemency. Amen.

<span id="v.xiii-p2"></span> Arbogastes, a Frankish general, had been
set by Theodosius over the troops in Gaul, and determined to gain
supreme power in the West. Having removed all who were faithful from the
person of the Emperor Valentinian II., he caused him to be murdered, and
then to conceal his own purposes caused the rhetorician Eugenius, his
private secretary, to be acknowledged Emperor. Ambassadors were sent to
Theodosius begging him to acknowledge the new Emperor as his colleague,
but he saw through the design, and after two years’ preparation marched
into Italy, and defeated the usurper’s troops. Eugenius was beheaded,
and Arbogastes killed himself.

<span id="v.xiii-p6"></span> *i.e.* Eugenius, whom St. Ambrose avoided,
because he had permitted the restoration of heathen ceremonies. See also

<span id="v.xiii-p8"></span> Theodoret, *Hist. Eccl.* V. 24, relates
certain prophecies and several prodigies connected with this victory, to
which there seems to be some allusion here.
