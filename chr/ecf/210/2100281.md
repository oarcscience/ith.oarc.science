### <span id="iv.v.vii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.

<span id="iv.v.vii-p1"></span>Why they who come forth from the laver of
baptism are anointed on the head; why, too, after baptism, their feet
are washed, and what sins are remitted in each case.

<span id="iv.v.vii-p2"></span>29. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.vii-p2.1"></span>After</span> this, you went up to the priest,
consider what followed. Was it not that of which David speaks: “Like the
ointment upon the head, which went down to the beard, even Aaron’s
beard”? <span id="fr_2862"></span>[2863](#fn_2862.md) This is the ointment
of which Solomon, too, says: “Thy Name is ointment poured out, therefore
have the maidens loved Thee and drawn Thee.” <span
id="fr_2863"></span>[2864](#fn_2863.md) How many souls regenerated this day
have loved Thee, Lord Jesus, and have said: “Draw us after Thee, we are
running after the odour of Thy garments,” <span
id="fr_2864"></span>[2865](#fn_2864.md) that they might drink in the odour
of Thy resurrection.

<span id="iv.v.vii-p6"></span>30. Consider now why this is done, for
“the eyes of a wise man are in his head;” <span
id="fr_2865"></span>[2866](#fn_2865.md) therefore the ointment flows down
to the beard, that is to say, to the beauty of youth; and therefore,
Aaron’s beard, that we, too, may become a chosen race, priestly and
precious, for we are all anointed with spiritual grace for a share in
the kingdom of God and in the priesthood.

<span id="iv.v.vii-p8"></span>31. You went up from the font; remember
the Gospel lesson. For our Lord Jesus Christ in the Gospel washed the
feet of His disciples. When He came to Simon Peter, Peter said: “Thou
shalt never wash my feet.” <span id="fr_2866"></span>[2867](#fn_2866.md) He
did not perceive the mystery, and therefore he refused the service, for
he thought that the humility of the servant would be injured, if he
patiently allowed the Lord to minister to him. And the Lord answered
him: “If I wash not thy feet, thou wilt have no part with Me.” Peter,
hearing this, replies: “Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my
head.” The Lord answered: “He that is washed needeth not save to wash
his feet but is clean every whit.” <span
id="fr_2867"></span>[2868](#fn_2867.md)

<span id="iv.v.vii-p11"></span>32. Peter was clean, but he must wash his
feet, for he had sin by succession from the first man, when the serpent
overthrew him and persuaded him to sin. His feet were therefore washed,
that hereditary sins might be done away, for our own sins are remitted
through baptism.

<span id="iv.v.vii-p12"></span>33. Observe at the same time that the
mystery consists in the very office of humility, for Christ says: “If I,
your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; how much more ought you to
wash one another’s feet.” For, since the Author of Salvation Himself
redeemed us through His obedience, how much more ought we His servants
to offer the service of our humility and obedience.

[Next: Chapter VII. The washing away of sins is indicated by the white
robes of the catechumens, whence the Church speaks of herself as black
and comely. Angels marvel at her brightness as at that of the flesh of
the Lord. Moreover, Christ Himself commended His beauty to His Spouse
under many figures. The mutual affection of the one for the other is
described.](2100282.md)
