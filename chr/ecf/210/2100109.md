<span id="iv.i.iv.xv"></span>

#### <span id="iv.i.iv.xv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XV.

<span id="iv.i.iv.xv-p1"></span>After mentioning a noble action of the
Romans, the writer shows from the deeds of Moses that he had the
greatest regard for what is virtuous.

<span id="iv.i.iv.xv-p2"></span>91. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.iv.xv-p2.1"></span>It</span> is related as a memorable deed of
a Roman general, <span id="fr_694"></span>[695](#fn_694) that when the
physician of a hostile king came to him and promised to give him poison,
he sent him back bound to the enemy. In truth, it is a noble thing for a
man to refuse to gain the victory by foul acts, after he has entered on
the struggle for power. He did not consider virtue to lie in victory,
but declared that to be a shameful victory unless it was gained with
honour. <span id="fr_695"></span>[696](#fn_695)

<span id="iv.i.iv.xv-p5"></span>92. Let us return to our hero Moses, and
to loftier deeds, to show they were both superior as well as earlier.
The king of Egypt would not let the people of our fathers go. Then Moses
bade the priest Aaron to stretch his rod over all the waters of Egypt.
Aaron stretched it out, and the water of the river was turned into
blood. <span id="fr_696"></span>[697](#fn_696) None could drink the
water, and all the Egyptians were perishing with thirst; but there was
pure water flowing in abundance for the fathers. They sprinkled ashes
toward heaven, and sores and burning boils came upon man and
beast. <span id="fr_697"></span>[698](#fn_697) They brought down hail
mingled with flaming fire, and all things were destroyed upon the
land. <span id="fr_698"></span>[699](#fn_698) Moses prayed, and all
things were restored to their former beauty. The hail ceased, the sores
were healed, the rivers gave their wonted draught. <span
id="fr_699"></span>[700](#fn_699)

<span id="iv.i.iv.xv-p10"></span>93. Then, again, the land was covered
with thick darkness for the space of three days, because Moses had
raised his hand and spread out the darkness. <span
id="fr_700"></span>[701](#fn_700) All the first-born of Egypt died,
whilst all the offspring of the Hebrews was left unharmed. <span
id="fr_701"></span>[702](#fn_701) Moses was asked to put an end to these
horrors, and he prayed and obtained his request. In the one case it was
a fact worthy of praise that he checked himself from joining in deceit;
in the other it was noteworthy how, by his innate goodness, he turned
aside from the foe those divinely ordered punishments. He was indeed, as
it is written, gentle and meek. <span id="fr_702"></span>[703](#fn_702)
He knew that the king would not keep true to his promises, yet he
thought it right and good to pray when asked to do so, to bless when
wronged, to forgive when besought.

<span id="iv.i.iv.xv-p14"></span>94. He cast down his rod and it became
a serpent which devoured the serpents of Egypt; <span
id="fr_703"></span>[704](#fn_703) this signifying that the Word should
become Flesh to destroy the poison of the dread serpent by the
forgiveness and pardon of sins. For the rod stands for the Word that is
true—royal—filled with power—and glorious in ruling. The rod became a
serpent; so He Who was the Son of God begotten of the Father became the
Son of man born of a woman, and lifted, like the serpent, on the cross,
poured His healing medicine on the wounds of man. Wherefore the Lord
Himself says: “As <span id="page_83">p. 83</span> <span
id="iv.i.iv.xv-Page_83"></span>Moses lifted up the serpent in the
wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up.” <span
id="fr_704"></span>[705](#fn_704)

<span id="iv.i.iv.xv-p17"></span>95. Again, another sign which Moses
gave points to our Lord Jesus Christ. He put his hand into his bosom,
and drew it out again, and his hand was become as snow. A second time he
put it in and drew it out, and it was again like the appearance of human
flesh. <span id="fr_705"></span>[706](#fn_705) This signified first the
original glory of the Godhead of the Lord Jesus, and then the assumption
of our flesh, in which truth all nations and peoples must believe. So he
put in his hand, for Christ is the right hand of God; and whosoever does
not believe in His Godhead and Incarnation is punished as a sinner; like
that king who, whilst not believing open and plain signs, yet
afterwards, when punished, prayed that he might find mercy. How great,
then, Moses’ regard for virtue must have been is shown by these proofs,
and especially by the fact that he offered himself on behalf of the
people, praying that God would either forgive the people or blot him out
of the book of the living. <span id="fr_706"></span>[707](#fn_706)
