#### <span id="iv.iv.iii.xiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIII.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xiv-p1"></span>Discussion of the Divine Generation
is continued. St. Ambrose illustrates its method by the same example as
that employed by the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews. The duty of
believing what is revealed is shown by the example of Nebuchadnezzar and
St. Peter. By the vision granted to St. Peter was shown the Son’s
Eternity and Godhead—the Apostle, then, must be believed in preference
to the teachers of philosophy, whose authority was everywhere falling
into discredit. The Arians, on the other hand, are shown to be like unto
the heathen.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xiv-p2"></span>79. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.iii.xiv-p2.1"></span>It</span> will be asked: “In what sort
was the Son begotten?” As one who is for ever, as the Word, as the
brightness of eternal light, <span id="fr_1818"></span>[1819](#fn_1818)
for brightness takes effect in the instant of its coming into existence.
Which example is the Apostle’s, not mine. Think not, then, that there
was ever a moment of time when God was without wisdom, any more than
that there was ever a time when light was without radiance. Judge not,
Arian, divine things by human, but believe the divine where thou findest
not the human.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xiv-p4"></span>80. The heathen king saw in the fire,
together with the three Hebrew children, the form of a fourth, like as
of an angel, <span id="fr_1819"></span>[1820](#fn_1819) and because he
thought that this angel excelled all angels, he judged Him to be the Son
of God, Whom he had not read of, but in Whom <span id="page_215">p.
215</span> <span id="iv.iv.iii.xiv-Page_215"></span>he believed.
Abraham, also, saw Three, and adored One. <span
id="fr_1820"></span>[1821](#fn_1820)

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xiv-p7"></span>81. Peter, when he saw Moses and
Elias on the mountain, with the Son of God, was not deceived as to their
nature and glory. For he enquired, not of them, but of Christ, what he
ought to do, inasmuch as though he prepared to do homage to all three,
yet he waited for the command of one. But since he ignorantly thought
that for three persons three tabernacles should be set up, he was
corrected by the sovereign voice of God the Father, saying, “This is My
dearly beloved Son: hear ye Him.” <span
id="fr_1821"></span>[1822](#fn_1821) That is to say: “Why dost thou join
thy fellow-servants in equality with thy Lord?” “This is My Son.” Not
“Moses is My Son,” nor “Elias is My Son,” but “This is My Son.” The
Apostle was not dull to understand the rebuke; he fell on his face,
brought low by the Father’s voice and the glorious beauty of the Son,
but he was raised up by the Son, Whose wont it is to raise up them that
are fallen. <span id="fr_1822"></span>[1823](#fn_1822) Then he saw one
only, <span id="fr_1823"></span>[1824](#fn_1823) the Son of God alone,
for the servants had withdrawn, that He might be seen to be Lord alone,
Who alone was entitled Son.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xiv-p11"></span>82. What, then, was the purpose of
that vision, which signified not that Christ and His servants were
equal, but betokened a mystery, save that it should be made plain to us
that the Law and the Prophets, in agreement with the Gospel, revealed as
eternal the Son of God, Whom they had heralded. When we, therefore, hear
of the Son coming forth of the womb, the Word from the heart, let us
believe that the Son was not fashioned with hands but begotten of the
Father, not the work of a craftsman but the offspring of a parent.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xiv-p12"></span>83. He, therefore, Who said, “This
is My Son,” said not, “This is a creature of time,” nor “This being is
of My creation, My making, My servant,” but “This is My Son, Whom ye see
glorified.” This is the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of
Jacob, Who appeared to Moses in the bush, <span
id="fr_1824"></span>[1825](#fn_1824) concerning Whom Moses saith, “He
Who is hath sent me.” It was not the Father Who spake to Moses in the
bush or in the desert, but the Son. It was of this Moses that Stephen
said, “This is He Who was in the church, in the wilderness, with the
Angel.” <span id="fr_1825"></span>[1826](#fn_1825) This, then, is He Who
gave the Law, Who spake with Moses, saying, “I am the God of Abraham,
the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob.” This, then, is the God of the
patriarchs, this is the God of the prophets.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xiv-p15"></span>84. It is of the Son, therefore,
that we read, thy mind understandeth the reading, let thy tongue make
confession. Away with arguments, where faith is required; now let
dialectic hold her peace, even in the midst of her schools. I ask not
what it is that philosophers say, but I would know what they do. They
sit desolate in their schools. See the victory of faith over argument.
They who dispute subtly are forsaken daily by their fellows; they who
with simplicity believe are daily increased. Not philosophers but
fishermen, not masters of dialectic but tax-gatherers, now find
credence. The one sort, through pleasures and luxuries, have bound the
world’s burden upon themselves; the other, by fasting and mortification,
have cast it off, and so doth sorrow now begin to win over more
followers than pleasure.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xiv-p16"></span>85. Let us now see how far Arians
and pagans do differ. The latter call upon gods, who are different in
sex and unequal in power; the former affirm a Trinity where there is
likewise inequality of power and diversity of Godhead. The pagans assert
that their Gods began to exist once upon a time; the Arians lyingly
declare that Christ began to exist in the course of time. Have they not
all dyed their impiety in the vats of philosophy? But indeed the pagans
do extol that which they worship, <span
id="fr_1826"></span>[1827](#fn_1826) the Arians maintain that the Son of
God, Who is God, is a creature.

[Next: Chapter XIV. That the Son of God is not a created being is proved
by the following arguments: (1) That He commanded not that the Gospel
should be preached to Himself; (2) that a created being is given over
unto vanity; (3) that the Son has created all things; (4) that we read
of Him as begotten; and (5) that the difference of generation and
adoption has always been understood in those places where both
natures--the divine and the human--are declared to co-exist in Him. All
of which testimony is confirmed by the Apostle's
interpretation.](2100197)
