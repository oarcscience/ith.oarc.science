#### <span id="iv.ii.ii.xi-p0.1"></span>Chapter X.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xi-p1"></span>That the Spirit forgives sin is common
to Him with the Father and the Son, but not with the Angels.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xi-p2"></span>112. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.ii.ii.xi-p2.1"></span>Tell</span> me, then, whoever you are who
deny the Godhead of the Holy Spirit. The Spirit could not be liable to
sin, Who rather forgives sin. Does an Angel forgive? Does an Archangel?
Certainly not, but the Father alone, the Son alone, and the Holy Spirit
alone. Now no one is unable to avoid that which he has power to forgive.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xi-p3"></span>113. But perhaps some one will say that
the Seraph said to Isaiah: “Behold, this hath touched thy lips, and
shall take away thine iniquities, and purge away thy sins.” <span
id="fr_925"></span>[926](#fn_925.md) Shall take away, he says, and shall
purge, not I will take away, but that fire from the altar of God, that
is, the grace of the Spirit. For what else can we piously understand to
be on the altar of God but the grace of the Spirit? Certainly not the
wood of the forests, nor the soot and coals. Or what is so in accordance
with piety as to understand according to the mystery that it was
revealed by the mouth of Isaiah that all men should be cleansed by the
passion of Christ, Who as a coal according to the flesh burnt up our
sins, as you read in Zechariah: “Is not this a brand cast forth from the
fire? And that was Joshua clothed in filthy garments.” <span
id="fr_926"></span>[927](#fn_926.md)

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xi-p6"></span>114. Lastly, that we may know that this
mystery of the common redemption was most clearly revealed by the
prophets, you have also in this place: “Lo, it hath taken away thy
sins;” <span id="fr_927"></span>[928](#fn_927.md) not that Christ put aside
His sins Who did no sin, but that in the flesh of Christ the whole human
race should be loosed from their sins.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xi-p8"></span>115. But even if the Seraph had taken
away sin, it would have been as one of the ministers of God appointed to
this mystery. For thus said Isaiah: “For one of the Seraphim was sent to
me.” <span id="fr_928"></span>[929](#fn_928.md)

[Next: Chapter XI. The Spirit is sent to all, and passes not from place
to place, for He is not limited either by time or space. He goes forth
from the Son, as the Son from the Father, in Whom He ever abides: and
also comes to us when we receive. He comes also after the same manner as
the Father Himself, from Whom He can by no means be separated.](2100131.md)
