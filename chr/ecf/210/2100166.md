#### <span id="iv.ii.iv.xiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIV.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.xiv-p1"></span>Besides the evidence adduced above,
other passages can be brought to prove the sovereignty of the Three
Persons. Two are quoted from the Epistles to the Thessalonians, and by
collating other testimonies of the Scriptures it is shown that in them
dominion is claimed for the Spirit as for the other Persons. Then, by
quotation of another still more express passage in the second Epistle to
the Corinthians, it is inferred both that the Spirit is Lord, and that
where the Lord is, there is the Spirit.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.xiv-p2"></span>94. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.ii.iv.xiv-p2.1"></span>God</span>, then, is One, without
violation of the majesty of the eternal Trinity, as is declared in the
instance set before us. And not in that place alone do we see the
Trinity expressed in the Name of the Godhead; but both in many places,
as we have said also above, and especially in the epistles which the
Apostle wrote to the Thessalonians, he most clearly set forth the
Godhead and sovereignty of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. For
you read as follows: <span id="page_149">p. 149</span> <span
id="iv.ii.iv.xiv-Page_149"></span>“The Lord make you to increase and
abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, as we also do
toward you, to the stablishing of your hearts without blame in holiness
before God and our Father at the coming of the Lord Jesus.” <span
id="fr_1356"></span>[1357](#fn_1356)

<span id="iv.ii.iv.xiv-p4"></span>95. Who, then, is the Lord Who makes
us to increase and abound before God and our Father at the coming of the
Lord Jesus? He has named the Father and has named the Son; Whom, then,
has he joined with the Father and the Son except the Spirit? Who is the
Lord Who establishes our hearts in holiness. For holiness is a grace of
the Spirit, as, too, is said farther on: “In holiness of the Spirit and
belief of the truth.” <span id="fr_1357"></span>[1358](#fn_1357)

<span id="iv.ii.iv.xiv-p6"></span>96. Who, then, do you think is here
named Lord, except the Spirit? And has not God the Father been able to
teach you, Who says: “Upon Whomsoever thou shalt see the Spirit
descending and abiding upon Him, this is He Who baptizeth in the Holy
Spirit”? <span id="fr_1358"></span>[1359](#fn_1358) For the Spirit
descended in the likeness of a dove, <span
id="fr_1359"></span>[1360](#fn_1359) that He might both bear witness to
His wisdom, and perfect the sacrament of the spiritual laver, and show
that His working is one with that of the Father and the Son.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.xiv-p9"></span>97. And that you should not suppose
that anything had fallen from the Apostle by oversight, but that he
knowingly and designedly and inspired by the Spirit designated Him Lord,
Whom he felt to be God, he repeated the same in the second Epistle to
the Thessalonians, saying: “But the Lord direct your hearts in the love
of God and in the patience of Christ.” <span
id="fr_1360"></span>[1361](#fn_1360) If love be of God and patience of
Christ, it ought to be shown Who is the Lord Who directs, if we deny
that the direction is of the Holy Spirit.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.xiv-p11"></span>98. But we cannot deny it, since the
Lord said of Him: “I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot
bear them now. But when He, the Spirit of Truth, shall come, He will
lead you into all truth.” <span id="fr_1361"></span>[1362](#fn_1361) And
David says of Him: “Thy good Spirit shall lead me into the right
way.” <span id="fr_1362"></span>[1363](#fn_1362)

<span id="iv.ii.iv.xiv-p14"></span>99. See what the voice of the Lord
uttered concerning the Holy Spirit. The Son of God came, and because He
had not yet shed forth the Spirit, He declared that we were living like
little children without the Spirit. He said that the Spirit was to come
Who should make of these little children stronger men, by an increase,
namely, of spiritual age. And this He laid down not that He might set
the power of the Spirit in the first place, but that He might show that
the fulness of strength consists in the knowledge of the Trinity.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.xiv-p15"></span>100. It is therefore necessary either
that you mention some fourth person besides the Spirit of whom you ought
to be conscious, or assuredly that you do not consider another to be
Lord, except the Spirit Who has been pointed out.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.xiv-p16"></span>101. But if you require the plain
statement of the words in which Scripture has spoken of the Spirit as
Lord, it cannot have escaped you that it is written: “Now the Lord is
the Spirit.” <span id="fr_1363"></span>[1364](#fn_1363) Which the course
of the whole passage shows to have been certainly said of the Holy
Spirit. And so let us consider the apostolic statement: “As often as
Moses is read,” says he, “a veil is laid over their heart; but when they
shall be turned to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away. Now the Lord
is the Spirit; but where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is
liberty.” <span id="fr_1364"></span>[1365](#fn_1364)

<span id="iv.ii.iv.xiv-p19"></span>102. So he not only called the Spirit
Lord, but also added: “But where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is
liberty. So we all with unveiled face, reflecting the glory of the Lord,
are formed anew into the same image from glory to glory, as from the
Lord the Spirit;” <span id="fr_1365"></span>[1366](#fn_1365) that is, we
who have been before converted to the Lord, so as by spiritual
understanding to see the glory of the Lord, as it were, in the mirror of
the Scriptures, are now being transformed from that glory which
converted us to the Lord, to the heavenly glory. Therefore since it is
the Lord to Whom we are converted, but the Lord is that Spirit by Whom
we are formed anew, who are converted to the Lord, assuredly the Holy
Ghost is pointed out, for He Who forms anew receives those who are
converted. For how should He form again those whom He had not received.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.xiv-p21"></span>103. Though why should we seek for
the expression of words, where we see the expression of unity? For
although you may distinguish between Lord and Spirit, you cannot deny
that where the Lord is, there too is the Spirit, and he who has been
converted to the Lord will have been converted to the Spirit. If you
cavil at the letter, you cannot injure the Unity; if you wish to
separate the Unity, you confess the Spirit Himself as the Lord of power.

[Next: Chapter XV. Though the Spirit be called Lord, three Lords are not
thereby implied; inasmuch as two Lords are not implied by the fact that
the Son in the same manner as the Father is called Lord in many passages
of Scripture; for Lordship exists in the Godhead, and the Godhead in
Lordship, and these coincide without division in the Three
Persons.](2100167)
