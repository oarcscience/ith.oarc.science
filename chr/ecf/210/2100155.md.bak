<span id="iv.ii.iv.iii"></span>

#### <span id="iv.ii.iv.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.iii-p1"></span>The same Unity may also be recognized
from the fact that the Spirit is called Finger, and the Son Right Hand;
for the understanding of divine things is assisted by the usage of human
language. The tables of the law were written by this Finger, and they
were afterwards broken, and the reason. Lastly, Christ wrote with the
same Finger; yet we must not admit any inferiority in the Spirit from
this bodily comparison.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.iii-p2"></span>11. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.ii.iv.iii-p2.1"></span>So</span>, too, the Spirit is also called
the Finger of God, because there is an indivisible and inseparable
communion between the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. For as the
Scripture called the Son of God the Right Hand of God, as it is said:
“Thy Right Hand, O Lord, is made glorious in power. Thy Right Hand, O
Lord, hath dashed in pieces the enemy;” <span
id="fr_1247"></span>[1248](#fn_1247.md) so the Holy Spirit is called the
Finger of God, as the Lord Himself says: “But if I by the Finger of God
cast out devils.” <span id="fr_1248"></span>[1249](#fn_1248.md) For in the
same place in another book of the Gospel He named the Spirit of God, as
you find: “But if I by the Spirit of God cast out devils.” <span
id="fr_1249"></span>[1250](#fn_1249.md)

<span id="iv.ii.iv.iii-p6"></span>12. What, then, could have been said
to signify more expressly the unity of the Godhead, or of Its working,
which Unity is according to the Godhead of the Father, or of the Son, or
of the Holy Spirit, than that we should understand that the fulness of
the eternal Godhead would seem to be divided far more than this body of
ours, if any one were to sever the unity of Substance, and multiply Its
powers, whereas the eternity of the same Godhead is one?

<span id="iv.ii.iv.iii-p7"></span>13. For oftentimes it is convenient to
estimate from our own words those things which are above us, and because
we cannot see those things we draw inferences from those which we can
see. “For the invisible things of Him,” says the Apostle, “from the
creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by those things
which are made.” <span id="fr_1250"></span>[1251](#fn_1250.md) And he adds:
“His eternal power also and Godhead.” <span
id="fr_1251"></span>[1252](#fn_1251.md) Of which one thing seems to be said
of the Son, and another of the Holy Spirit; that in the same manner as
the Son is called the eternal Power of the Father, so, also, the Spirit,
because He is divine, should be believed to be His eternal Godhead. For
the Son, too, because He ever lives, is eternal life. This Finger, then,
of God is both eternal and divine. For what is there belonging to God
which is not eternal and divine?

<span id="iv.ii.iv.iii-p10"></span>14. With this Finger, as we read, God
wrote on those tables of stone which Moses received. For God did not
with a finger of flesh write the forms and portions of those letters
which we read, but gave the law by His Spirit. And so the Apostle says:
“For the Law is spiritual, which, indeed, is written not with ink, but
with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but on fleshy
tables of the heart.” <span id="fr_1252"></span>[1253](#fn_1252.md) For if
the letter of the Apostle is written in the Spirit, what hinders us from
believing that the Law of God was written not with ink, but with the
Spirit of God, which certainly does not stain but enlightens the secret
places of our heart and mind?

<span id="iv.ii.iv.iii-p12"></span>14. Now it was written on tables of
stone, because it was written in a type, but the tables were first
broken and cast out of the hands of Moses, because the Jews fell away
from the works of the prophet. And fitly were the tables broken, not the
writing erased. And do you see that your table be not broken, that your
mind and soul be not <span id="page_138">p. 138</span> <span
id="iv.ii.iv.iii-Page_138"></span>divided. Is Christ divided? He is not
divided, but is one with the Father; and let no one separate you from
Him. If your faith fails, the table of your heart is broken. The
coherence of your soul is lessened if you do not believe the unity of
Godhead in the Trinity. Your faith is written, and your sin is written,
as Jeremiah said: “Thy sin, O Judah, is written with a pen of iron and
the point of a diamond. And it is written,” he says, “on thy breast and
on thy heart.” <span id="fr_1253"></span>[1254](#fn_1253.md) The sin,
therefore, is there where grace is, but the sin is written with a pen,
grace is denoted by the Spirit.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.iii-p14"></span>15. With this Finger, also, the Lord
Jesus, with bowed head, mystically wrote on the ground, when the
adulteress was brought before Him by the Jews, signifying in a figure
that, when we judge of the sins of another, we ought to remember our
own.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.iii-p15"></span>16. And lest, again, because God
wrote the Law by His Spirit, we should believe any inferiority, as it
were, concerning the ministry of the Spirit, or from the consideration
of our own body should think the Spirit to be a small part of God, the
Apostle says, elsewhere, that he does not speak with words of human
wisdom, but in words taught by the Spirit, and that he compares
spiritual things with spiritual; but that the natural man receiveth not
the things which pertain to the Spirit of God. <span
id="fr_1254"></span>[1255](#fn_1254.md) For he knew that he who compared
divine with carnal things was amongst natural things, and not to be
reckoned amongst spiritual men; “for they are foolishness,” he says,
“unto him.” <span id="fr_1255"></span>[1256](#fn_1255.md) And so, because
he knew that these questions would arise amongst natural men, foreseeing
the future he says: “For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he
may instruct Him? But we have the mind of Christ.” <span
id="fr_1256"></span>[1257](#fn_1256.md)

[Next: Chapter IV. To those who contend that the Spirit because He is
called the Finger is less than the Father, St. Ambrose replies that this
would also tend to the lessening of the Son, Who is called the Right
Hand. That these names are to be referred only to the Unity, for which
reason Moses proclaimed that the whole Trinity worked in the passage of
the Red Sea. And, indeed, it is no wonder that the operation of the
Spirit found place there, where there was a figure of baptism, since the
Scripture teaches that the Three Persons equally sanctify and are
operative in that sacrament.](2100156.md)
