<span id="iv.iv.v.xv"></span>

#### <span id="iv.iv.v.xv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XV.

<span id="iv.iv.v.xv-p1"></span>The Arians, inasmuch as they assert the
Son to be “of another substance,” plainly acknowledge substance in God.
The only reason why they avoid the use of this term is that they will
not, as Eusebius of Nicomedia has made it evident, confess Christ to be
the true Son of God.

<span id="iv.iv.v.xv-p2"></span>123. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.v.xv-p2.1"></span>How</span> can the Arians deny the substance
of God? <span id="fr_2308"></span>[2309](#fn_2308.md) How can they suppose
that the word “substance” which is found in many places of Scripture
ought to be debarred from use, when they themselves do yet, by saying
that the Son is “<span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iv.v.xv-p3.1"></span>ἑτεροούσιος</span>,” that is, of another
substance, admit substance in God?

<span id="iv.iv.v.xv-p4"></span>124. It is not the term itself, then,
but its force and consequences, that they shun, because they will not
confess the Son of God to be true \[God\]. <span
id="fr_2309"></span>[2310](#fn_2309.md) For though the process of the
divine generation cannot be comprehended in human language, still the
Fathers judged that their faith might be fitly distinguished by the use
of such a term, as against that of “<span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iv.v.xv-p5.1"></span>ἑτεροούσιος</span> ,” following the
authority of the prophet, who saith: “Who hath stood in the truth
(*substantia*) of the Lord, and seen His Word?” <span
id="fr_2310"></span>[2311](#fn_2310.md) Arians, therefore, admit the term
“substance” when it is used so as to square with their blasphemy;
contrariwise, when it is adopted in accordance with the pious devotion
of the faithful, they reject and dispute against it.

<span id="iv.iv.v.xv-p7"></span>125. What other reason can there be for
their unwillingness to have the Son spoken of as “<span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.iv.v.xv-p7.1"></span>ὁ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.iv.v.xv-p7.2"></span>μοούσιος</span>,” of the
same substance, with the Father, but that they are unwilling <span
id="page_260">p. 260</span> <span id="iv.iv.v.xv-Page_260"></span>to
confess Him the true Son of God? This is betrayed in the letter of
Eusebius of Nicomedia. “If,” writes he, “we say that the Son is true God
and uncreate, then we are in the way to confess Him to be of one
substance (<span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iv.v.xv-p7.3"></span>ὁμοούσιος</span>) with the Father.” When
this letter had been read before the Council assembled at Nicæa, the
Fathers put this word in their exposition of the Faith, because they saw
that it daunted their adversaries; in order that they might take the
sword, which their opponents had drawn, to smite off the head of those
opponents’ own blasphemous heresy. <span
id="fr_2311"></span>[2312](#fn_2311.md)

<span id="iv.iv.v.xv-p9"></span>126. Vain, however, is their plea, that
they avoid the use of the term, because of the Sabellians; <span
id="fr_2312"></span>[2313](#fn_2312.md) whereby they betray their own
ignorance, for a being is of the same substance (<span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.iv.v.xv-p10.13"></span>ὁ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.iv.v.xv-p10.14"></span>μοούσιον</span>) with
another, not with itself. Rightly, then, do we call the Son “<span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.iv.v.xv-p10.15"></span>ὁ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.iv.v.xv-p10.16"></span>μοούσιος</span>” (of
the same substance), with the Father, forasmuch as that term expresses
both the distinction of Persons and the unity of nature.

<span id="iv.iv.v.xv-p11"></span>127. Can they deny that the term “<span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.iv.v.xv-p11.1"></span>οὐσία</span>” is met
with in Scripture, when the Lord has spoken of bread, that is, “<span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.iv.v.xv-p11.2"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.iv.v.xv-p11.3"></span>πιούσιος</span>,” <span
id="fr_2313"></span>[2314](#fn_2313.md) and Moses has written “<span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.iv.v.xv-p12.3"></span>ὑμεῖς ἔσεσθέ μοι λαὸς
περιούσιος</span> ”? <span id="fr_2314"></span>[2315](#fn_2314.md) What
does “<span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iv.v.xv-p13.2"></span>οὐσία</span>” mean, whence comes the name,
but from “<span class="Greek"><span id="iv.iv.v.xv-p13.3"></span>οὖσα
ἀεί</span>,” <span id="fr_2315"></span>[2316](#fn_2315.md) “that which
endures for ever? For He Who *is*, and *is* for ever, is God; and
therefore the Divine Substance, abiding everlastingly, is called <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.iv.v.xv-p14.4"></span>οὐσία</span>. Bread is
<span class="Greek"><span id="iv.iv.v.xv-p14.5"></span>ἐπιούσιος</span>,
because, taking the substance of abiding power from the substance of the
Word, it supplies this to heart and soul, for it is written: “And bread
strengtheneth man’s heart.” <span id="fr_2316"></span>[2317](#fn_2316.md)

<span id="iv.iv.v.xv-p16"></span>128. Let us, then, keep the precepts of
our forefathers, nor with rude and reckless daring profane the symbols
bequeathed to us. That sealed book of prophecy, whereof we have heard,
neither elders, nor powers, nor angels, nor archangels, ventured to
open; for Christ alone is reserved the peculiar right of opening
it. <span id="fr_2317"></span>[2318](#fn_2317.md) Who amongst us dare
unseal the book of the priesthood, sealed by confessors, and long
hallowed by the testimony of many? <span
id="fr_2318"></span>[2319](#fn_2318.md) They who have been constrained to
unseal, nevertheless have since, respecting the deceit put upon them,
sealed again; they who dared not lay sacrilegious hands upon it, have
stood forth as martyrs and confessors. How can we deny the Faith held by
those whose victory we proclaim?

id="iv.iv.v.xv-p9.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iv.v.xv-p10"></span> The Sabellians reduced the distinction
of Persons in the Trinity to a distinction of three different
self-manifestations of one and the same Person, appearing at different
times in different aspects or characters, as “one man in his time plays
many parts.” They, therefore, would mean, if they said that the Son was
<span class="Greek"><span id="iv.iv.v.xv-p10.1"></span>ὁ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.iv.v.xv-p10.2"></span>μοούσιος</span> with
the Father, that He was *identical* with Him. Another perverse use of
the term supervened upon the argument that if the Father and the Son
were <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iv.v.xv-p10.3"></span>ὁμοοὐσιοι</span> there must be some <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.iv.v.xv-p10.4"></span>οὐσία</span>, identical
with neither, but in which both, so to speak, had a share, by virtue of
participation in which they existed and were what they were—a theory
which adapted the Platonic doctrine of Universal Ideas to expound the
mysteries of the Godhead. It was the perverse use of the term by such
persons as Paul of Samosata (condemned by the Synod of Antioch, 269
<span class="sc"><span id="iv.iv.v.xv-p10.5"></span>a.d.</span>) that
caused it to be received at first with suspicion even by the orthodox at
the Nicene Synod in 325 <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.v.xv-p10.6"></span>a.d.</span> The true doctrine would be to
this effect, that in relation to the Persons, the Godhead is not a
separate, more comprehensive entity, existing independently, and the
fount of existence to each and all of the Persons—not as the Platonic
<span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iv.v.xv-p10.7"></span>αὐτάνθρωπος</span> (ideal or archetypal
man), for example, to the <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iv.v.xv-p10.8"></span>πολλοὶ ἄνθρωποι</span> (sundry
individuals), but is in each of the Persons fully and completely, yet
without destruction of its unity. The Godhead is a <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.iv.v.xv-p10.9"></span>πρώτη οὐσία</span>, a
single, individual substance. So also is each One of the Three
Persons—but their inter-relation is such that neither is the Godhead
anything apart from them, nor they anything apart from the Godhead or
from each other. It is the Three *together* that constitute the One
<span class="Greek"><span id="iv.iv.v.xv-p10.10"></span>Οὐσία</span> or
Essence, it is the definition of this Essence that applies to Each of
them equally, without difference, whilst Each Person retains His
Personal characteristics and Personal (not natural or substantial)
“*differentia.*” Speaking logically, the Three Persons are “of one
definition;” speaking metaphysically, they are “of one Essence.” Now
both “of one definition” and “of one essence” may be rendered by <span

<span id="iv.iv.v.xv-p14"></span> The derivation is philologically

pres. part. of <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iv.v.xv-p14.2"></span>εἶναι</span>, but for all that it embodies
a certain truth, inasmuch as <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iv.v.xv-p14.3"></span>οὐσία</span> in its abstract use denotes
simple existence, without reference to conditions.

The term <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iv.v.xv-p15.2"></span>ἐπιούσιος</span> has a spiritual import,
inasmuch as the life of the body, supported by bread, is not all but
should be subordinate to the spiritual life—the healthy body to be the
instrument and vehicle of the healthy soul, for man’s *real* life
(though he is not apt to think it such) is not dependent on bread
*alone*—his *whole* existence is not material, though one side of it is.
St. Ambrose, however, seems rather disposed to overlook the physical
material bread (which we are certainly taught to pray for) for the sake
of the supra-sensible Bread of Heaven and Food of Angels.

[Next: Chapter XVI. In order to forearm the orthodox against the
stratagems of the Arians, St. Ambrose discloses some of the deceitful
confessions used by the latter, and shows by various arguments, that
though they sometimes call the Son “God,” it is not enough, unless they
also admit His equality with the Father.](2100238.md)
