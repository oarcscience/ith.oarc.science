#### <span id="iv.i.iii.i-p0.1"></span>Chapter I.

<span id="iv.i.iii.i-p1"></span>Happiness in life is to be gained by
living virtuously, inasmuch as thus a Christian, whilst despising glory
and the favour of men, desires to please God alone in what he does.

<span id="iv.i.iii.i-p2"></span>1. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.iii.i-p2.1"></span>In</span> the first book we spoke of the
duties <span id="fr_368"></span>[369](#fn_368) which we thought befitted
a virtuous life, whereon no one has ever doubted but that a blessed
life, which the Scripture calls eternal life, depends. So great is the
splendour of a virtuous life that a peaceful conscience and a calm
innocence work out a happy life. And as the risen sun hides the globe of
the moon and the light of the stars, so the brightness of a virtuous
life, where it glitters in true pure glory, casts into the shade all
other things, which, according to the desires of the body, are
considered to be good, or are reckoned in the eyes of the world to be
great and noble.

<span id="iv.i.iii.i-p4"></span>2. Blessed, plainly, is that life which
is not valued at the estimation of outsiders, but is known, as judge of
itself, by its own inner feelings. It needs no popular opinion as its
reward in any way; nor has it any fear of punishments. Thus the less it
strives for glory, the more it rises above it. For to those who seek for
glory, that reward in the shape of present things is but a shadow of
future ones, and is a hindrance to eternal life, as it is written in the
Scriptures: “Verily, I say unto you, they have received their
reward.” <span id="fr_369"></span>[370](#fn_369) This is said of those
who, as it were, with the sound of a trumpet desire to make known to all
the world the liberality they exercise towards the poor. It is the same,
too, in the case of fasting, <span id="page_44">p. 44</span> <span
id="iv.i.iii.i-Page_44"></span>which is done but for outward show. “They
have,” he says, “their reward.”

<span id="iv.i.iii.i-p6"></span>3. It therefore belongs to a virtuous
life to show mercy and to fast in secret; that thou mayest seem to be
seeking a reward from thy God alone, and not from men. For he who seeks
it from man has his reward, but he who seeks it from God has eternal
life, which none can give but the Lord of Eternity, as it is said:
“Verily, I say unto thee, to-day shalt thou be with Me in
Paradise.” <span id="fr_370"></span>[371](#fn_370) Wherefore the
Scripture plainly has called that life which is blessed, eternal life.
It has not been left to be appraised according to man’s ideas on the
subject, but has been entrusted to the divine judgment.

[Next: Chapter II. The different ideas of philosophers on the subject of
happiness. He proves, first, from the Gospel that it rests on the
knowledge of God and the pursuit of good works; next, that it may not be
thought that this idea was adopted from the philosophers, he adds proofs
from the witness of the prophets.](2100065)
