<span id="iv.vi.iii.vi"></span>

#### <span id="iv.vi.iii.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.vi-p1"></span>St. Ambrose teaches out of the prophet
Isaiah what they must do who have fallen. Then referring to our Lord’s
proverbial expression respecting piping and dancing, he condemns dances.
Next by the example of Jeremiah he sets forth the necessary
accompaniments of repentance. And lastly, in order to show the efficacy
of this medicine of penance, he enumerates the names of many who have
used it for themselves or for others.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.vi-p2"></span>40. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.iii.vi-p2.1"></span>But</span> if they be not converted, do
you at least repent, who by many a slip have fallen from the lofty
pinnacle of innocence and faith. We have a good Lord, Whose will it is
to forgive all, Who called you by the prophet and said: “I, even I, am
He that blotteth out thy transgressions, and I will not remember, but do
thou remember that we may plead together.” “I,” He says, “will not
remember, but do thou remember,” that is to say, “I do not recall those
transgressions which I have forgiven thee, which are covered, as it
were, with oblivion, but do thou remember them. I will not remember them
because of My grace, do thou remember them in order to correction;
remember, thou mayest know that the sin is forgiven, boast not as though
innocent, that thou aggravate not the sin, but thou wilt be justified,
confess thy sin.” For a shamefaced confession of sins looses the bands
of transgression.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.vi-p3"></span>41. You see what God requires of you,
that you remember that grace which you have received, and boast not as
though you had not received it. You see by how complete a promise of
remission He draws you to confession. Take heed, lest by resisting the
commandments of God you fall into the <span id="page_351">p. 351</span>
<span id="iv.vi.iii.vi-Page_351"></span>offence of the Jews, to whom the
Lord Jesus said: “We piped to you and ye danced not; we wailed and ye
wept not.” <span id="fr_3099"></span>[3100](#fn_3099)

<span id="iv.vi.iii.vi-p5"></span>42. The words are ordinary words, but
the mystery is not ordinary. And so one must be on one’s guard, lest,
deceived by any common interpretation of this saying, one should suppose
that the movements of wanton dances and the madness of the stage were
commended; for these are full of evil in youthful age. But the dancing
is commended which David practised before the ark of God. For everything
is seemly which is done for religion, so that we need be ashamed of no
service which tends to the worship and honouring of Christ.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.vi-p6"></span>43. Dancing, then, which is an
accompaniment of pleasures and luxury, is not spoken of, but spiritually
such as that wherewith one raises the eager body, and suffers not the
limbs to lie slothfully on the ground, nor to grow stiff in their
accustomed tracks. Paul danced spiritually, when for us he stretched
forward, and forgetting the things which were behind, and aiming at
those which were before, he pressed on to the prize of Christ. <span
id="fr_3100"></span>[3101](#fn_3100) And you, too, when you come to
baptism, are warned to raise the hands, and to cause your feet wherewith
you ascend to things eternal to be swifter. This dancing accompanies
faith, and is the companion of grace.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.vi-p8"></span>44. This, then, is the mystery. “We
piped to you,” singing in truth the song of the New Testament, “and ye
danced not.” That is, did not raise your souls to the spiritual grace.
“We wailed, and ye wept not.” That is, ye did not repent. And therefore
was the Jewish people forsaken, because it did not repent, and rejected
grace. Repentance came by John, grace by Christ. He, as the Lord, gives
the one; the other is proclaimed, as it were, by the servant. The
Church, then, keeps both that it may both attain to grace and not cast
away repentance, for grace is the gift of One Who confers it; repentance
is the remedy of the sinner.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.vi-p9"></span>45. Jeremiah knew that penitence was a
great remedy, which he in his Lamentations took up for Jerusalem, and
brings forward Jerusalem itself as repenting, when he says: “She wept
sore in the night, and her tears are on her cheeks, nor is there one to
comfort her of all who love her. The ways of Sion do mourn.” <span
id="fr_3101"></span>[3102](#fn_3101) And he says further: “For these
things I weep, my eyes have grown dim with weeping, because he who used
to comfort me is gone far from me.” <span
id="fr_3102"></span>[3103](#fn_3102) We notice that he thought this the
bitterest addition to his woes, that he who used to comfort the mourner
was gone far from him. How, then, can you take away the very comfort by
refusing to repentance the hope of forgiveness?

<span id="iv.vi.iii.vi-p12"></span>46. But let those who repent learn
how they ought to carry it out, with what zeal, with what affection,
with what intention of mind, with what shaking of the inmost bowels,
with what conversion of heart: “Behold,” he says, “O Lord, that I am in
distress, my bowels are troubled by my weeping, my heart is turned
within me.” <span id="fr_3103"></span>[3104](#fn_3103)

<span id="iv.vi.iii.vi-p14"></span>47. Here you recognize the intention
of the soul, the faithfulness of the mind, the disposition of the body:
“The elders of the daughters of Sion sat,” he says, “upon the ground,
they put dust upon their heads, they girded themselves with haircloth,
the princes hung their heads to the ground, the virgins of Jerusalem
fainted with weeping, my eyes grew dim, my bowels were troubled, my
glory was poured on the earth.” <span
id="fr_3104"></span>[3105](#fn_3104)

<span id="iv.vi.iii.vi-p16"></span>48. So, too, did the people of
Nineveh mourn, and escaped the destruction of their city. <span
id="fr_3105"></span>[3106](#fn_3105) Such is the remedial power of
repentance, that God seems because of it to change His intention. To
escape is, then, in your own power; the Lord wills to be entreated, He
wills that men should hope in Him, He wills that supplication should be
made to Him. Thou art a man, and willest to be asked to forgive, and
dost thou think that God will pardon thee without asking Him?

<span id="iv.vi.iii.vi-p18"></span>49. The Lord Himself wept over
Jerusalem, that, inasmuch as it would not weep itself, it might obtain
forgiveness through the tears of the Lord. He wills that we should weep
in order that we may escape, as you find it in the Gospel: “Daughters of
Jerusalem, weep not for Me, but weep for yourselves.” <span
id="fr_3106"></span>[3107](#fn_3106)

<span id="iv.vi.iii.vi-p20"></span>50. David wept, and obtained of the
divine mercy the removal of the death of the people who were perishing,
when of the three things proposed for his choice he selected that in
which he might have the most experience of the divine mercy. Why do you
blush to weep for your sins, when God commanded even the prophets to
weep for the people?

<span id="iv.vi.iii.vi-p21"></span>51. And, lastly, Ezekiel was bidden
to weep for Jerusalem, and he took the book, <span id="page_352">p.
352</span> <span id="iv.vi.iii.vi-Page_352"></span>at the beginning of
which was written: “Lamentation, and melody, and woe,” <span
id="fr_3107"></span>[3108](#fn_3107) two things sad and one pleasant,
for he shall be saved in the future who has wept most in this age. “For
the heart of the wise is in the house of mourning, and the heart of
fools in the house of feasting.” <span
id="fr_3108"></span>[3109](#fn_3108) And the Lord Himself said: “Blessed
are ye that weep now, for ye shall laugh.” <span
id="fr_3109"></span>[3110](#fn_3109)

[Next: Chapter VII. An exhortation to mourning and confession of sins
for Christ is moved by these and the tears of the Church. Illustration
from the story of Lazarus. After showing that the Novatians are the
successors of those who planned to kill Lazarus, St. Ambrose argues that
the full forgiveness of every sin is signified by the odour of the
ointment poured by Mary on the feet of Christ; and further, that the
Novatian heretics find their likeness in Judas, who grudged and envied
when others rejoiced.](2100312)
