#### <span id="iv.vii.iii.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.

<span id="iv.vii.iii.vi-p1"></span>St. Ambrose, in concluding the second
book, ascribes any good there may be in it to the merits of the virgins,
and sets forth that it was right before laying down any severe precepts
to encourage them by examples, as is done both in human teaching and in
holy Scripture.

<span id="iv.vii.iii.vi-p2"></span>39. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vii.iii.vi-p2.1"></span>I, who</span> have been not yet three
years a bishop, have prepared this offering for you, holy virgins,
although untaught by my own experience, yet having learnt much from your
mode of life. For what experience could have grown up in so short a time
of being initiated in religion? If you find any flowers herein, gather
them together in the bosom of your lives. These are not precepts for
virgins, but instances taken from virgins. My words have sketched the
likeness of your virtue, you may see the reflection of your gravity, as
it were, in the mirror of this discourse. If you have received any
pleasure from my ability, all the fragrance of this book is yours. And
since there are as many opinions as there are persons, if there be
anything simple in my treatise let all read it; if anything stronger,
let the more mature prove it; if anything modest, let it cleave to the
breast and tinge the cheeks; if there be anything flowery, let the
flowery age of youth not disdain it.

<span id="iv.vii.iii.vi-p3"></span>40. We ought to stir up the love of
the bride, for it is written: “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God.” <span
id="fr_3248"></span>[3249](#fn_3248.md) At bridal feasts we ought to adorn
the hair at least with some ornaments of prayer, for it is written:
“Smite the hands together, and strike with the foot.” <span
id="fr_3249"></span>[3250](#fn_3249.md) We ought to scatter roses on those
uninterrupted bridals. Even in these temporal marriages the bride is
received with acclamation before she receives commands, lest hard
commands should hurt her, before love cherished by kindness grows
strong.

<span id="iv.vii.iii.vi-p6"></span>41. Horses learn to love the sound of
patting their necks, that they may not refuse the yoke, and are first
trained with words of enticement before the stripe of discipline. But
when the horse has submitted its neck to the yoke, the rein pulls in,
and the spur urges on, and its companions draw it, and the driver bids
it. So, too, our virgin ought first to play with pious love, and admire
the golden supports of the heavenly marriage couch on the very threshold
of marriage, and to see the door-posts adorned with wreaths of leaves,
and to taste the delight of the musicians playing within; that she may
not through fear withdraw herself from the Lord’s yoke, before she obeys
His call.

<span id="iv.vii.iii.vi-p7"></span>42. “Come, then, hither from Lebanon,
My spouse, come hither from Lebanon, thou shalt pass and pass
through.” <span id="fr_3250"></span>[3251](#fn_3250.md) This verse must be
often repeated by us, that at least being called by the words of the
Lord, she may follow if there be any who will not trust the words of
man. We have not formed this power for ourselves, but have received it;
this is the heavenly teaching of the mystic song: “Let Him kiss me with
the kisses of His mouth, for Thy breasts are better than wine, and the
odor of Thy ointments is above all spices. Thy name is as ointment
poured forth.” <span id="fr_3251"></span>[3252](#fn_3251.md) The whole of
that place of delights sounds of sport, stirs up approval, calls forth
love. “Therefore,” it continues, “have the maidens loved Thee and have
drawn Thee, let us run after the odour of Thy ointments. The King hath
brought me into His chamber.” <span id="fr_3252"></span>[3253](#fn_3252.md)
She began with kisses, and so attained to the chamber.

<span id="iv.vii.iii.vi-p11"></span>43. She, now so patient of hard
toil, and of practised virtue, as to open the bars with her hand, go
forth into the field, and abide in strongholds, at the beginning ran
after the odour of the ointment; soon when she is come into the chamber
the ointment is changed. And see whither she goes: “If it be a wall,” it
is said, “we will build upon it towers of silver.” <span
id="fr_3253"></span>[3254](#fn_3253.md) She who sported with kisses now
builds towers that, encircled with the precious battlements of the
saints, she may not only render fruitless the attacks of the enemy, but
also erect the safe defences of holy merits.
