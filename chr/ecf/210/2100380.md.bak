### <span id="v.xv-p0.1"></span>Epistle LXIII.

<span id="v.xv-p1"></span>Limenius, Bishop of Vercellæ, having died, the
see remained long vacant owing to domestic factions. St. Ambrose,
therefore, as Exarch, writes to the Christians at Vercellæ, and
commences by reference to the speedy and unanimous election of Eusebius,
a former Bishop, and reminds them of the presence of Christ as a reason
for concord. He refers next to two apostate monks, Sarmatio and
Barbatianus, and inveighs against sensuality, which degrades men below
the beasts. Thence he passes to the virtues required in a bishop,
referring again to Eusebius, and to Dionysius, Bishop of Milan,
comparing the clerical and monastic lives, and ends with exhortations to
Christian virtue. The letter seems to have been written <span
class="sc"><span id="v.xv-p1.1"></span>a.d.</span> 396.

<span id="v.xv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="v.xv-p2.1"></span>Ambrose</span>, a servant of Christ, called to be
a Bishop, to the Church of Vercellæ, and to those who call on the Name
of our Lord Jesus Christ, Grace be fulfilled unto you in the Holy Spirit
from God the Father and His only-begotten Son.

<span id="v.xv-p3"></span>1. I am spent with grief that the Church of
God which is among you is still without a bishop, and now alone of all
the regions of Liguria and Æmilia, and of the Venetiæ and other
neighbouring parts of Italy needs that care which other churches were
wont to ask for themselves from it; and what is a greater source of
shame to myself, the tension amongst you which causes the obstacle is
laid to my charge. Now since there are dissensions among you, how can we
decree anything, or you elect, or anyone agree to undertake this office
amongst those who are at variance which he could hardly sustain amongst
those who are at unity.

<span id="v.xv-p4"></span>2. Is this the training of a confessor, are
these the offspring of those righteous fathers who, as soon as they saw,
approved of holy Eusebius, whom they had never known before, preferring
him to their fellow-citizens, and he was no sooner amongst them than he
was approved, and much more when they had observed him. Justly did he
turn out so great a man, whom the whole Church elected, justly was it
believed that he whom all had demanded was elected by the judgment of
God. It is fitting then that you follow the example of your parents,
especially since you who have been instructed by a holy confessor ought
to be so much better than your fathers, as a better teacher has taught
and instructed you, and to manifest a sign of your moderation and
concord by agreeing in your request <span
id="fr_3645"></span>[3646](#fn_3645.md) for a Bishop.

<span id="v.xv-p6"></span>3. For if according to the Lord’s saying, that
which two shall have agreed upon on earth concerning anything which they
shall ask, shall be done for them, as He says, by My Father, Who is in
heaven, for: “Where two or three are gathered together in My Name, there
am I in the midst of them,” <span id="fr_3646"></span>[3647](#fn_3646.md)
how much less, where the full congregation is gathered in the Name of
the Lord. Where the demand of all is unanimous, ought we to doubt that
the Lord Jesus is there as the Author of that desire, and the Hearer of
the petition, the Presider over the ordination, and the Giver of the
grace?

<span id="v.xv-p8"></span>4. Make yourselves then to appear worthy that
Christ should be in your midst. For where peace is, there is Christ, for
Christ is Peace; and where righteousness is, there is Christ, for Christ
is Righteousness. Let Him be in the midst of you, that you may see Him,
lest it be said to you also: “There standeth One in the midst of you,
Whom ye see not.” <span id="fr_3647"></span>[3648](#fn_3647.md) The Jews
saw not Him in Whom they believed not; we look upon Him by devotion, and
behold Him by faith.

<span id="v.xv-p10"></span>5. Let Him therefore stand in your midst,
that the heavens, which declare the glory of God, <span
id="fr_3648"></span>[3649](#fn_3648.md) may be opened to you, that you may
do His will, and work His works. He who sees Jesus, to him are the
heavens opened as they were opened to Stephen, when he said: “Behold I
see the heavens opened and Jesus standing at the right hand of
God.” <span id="fr_3649"></span>[3650](#fn_3649.md) Jesus was standing as
his advocate, He was standing as though anxious, that He might help His
athlete Stephen in his conflict, He was standing as though ready to
crown His martyr.

<span id="v.xv-p13"></span>6. Let Him then be standing for you, that you
may not be afraid of Him sitting; for when sitting He judges, as Daniel
says: “The thrones were placed, and the books were opened, and the
Ancient of days did sit.” <span id="fr_3650"></span>[3651](#fn_3650.md) But
in the eighty-first \[second\] Psalm it is written: “God stood in the
congregation of gods, and decideth among the gods.” <span
id="fr_3651"></span>[3652](#fn_3651.md) So then when He sits He judges,
when He stands He decides, and He judges concerning the imperfect, but
decides among the gods. Let Him stand for you as a defender, as a good
shepherd, lest the fierce wolves assault you.

<span id="v.xv-p16"></span>7. And not in vain is my warning turned to
this point; for I hear that Sarmatio and Barbatianus <span
id="fr_3652"></span>[3653](#fn_3652.md) are come to you, foolish talkers,
<span id="page_458">p. 458</span> <span id="v.xv-Page_458"></span>who
say that there is no merit in abstinence, no grace in a frugal life,
none in virginity, that all are valued at one price, that they are mad
who chasten their flesh with fastings, that they may bring it into
subjection to the spirit. But if he had thought it madness, Paul the
Apostle would never himself have acted thus, nor written to instruct
others. For he glories in it, saying: “But I chasten my body, and bring
it into bondage, lest, after preaching to others, I myself should be
found reprobate.” <span id="fr_3653"></span>[3654](#fn_3653.md) So they who
do not chasten their body, and desire to preach to others, are
themselves esteemed reprobates.

<span id="v.xv-p19"></span>8. For is there anything so reprobate as that
which excites to luxury, to corruption, to wantonness, as the incentive
to lust, the enticer to pleasure, the fuel of incontinence, the
firebrand of desire? What new school has sent out these Epicureans? Not
a school of philosophers, as they themselves say, but of unlearned men
who preach pleasure, persuade to luxury, esteem chastity to be of no
use. They were with us, but they were not of us, <span
id="fr_3654"></span>[3655](#fn_3654.md) for we are not ashamed to say what
the Evangelist John said. But when settled here they used to fast at
first, they were enclosed within the monastery, there was no place for
luxury, the opportunity of mocking and disputing was cut off.

<span id="v.xv-p21"></span>9. This these dainty men could not endure.
They went abroad, then when they desired to return they were not
received; for I had heard many things which necessitated my being
cautious; I admonished them, but effected nothing. And so boiling over
they began to disseminate such things as made them the miserable
enticers to all vices. They utterly lost the benefit of having fasted;
they lost the fruits of their temporary continence. And so now they with
Satanic eagerness envy the good works of others, the fruit of which
themselves have failed to keep.

<span id="v.xv-p22"></span>10. What virgin can hear that there is no
reward for her chastity and not groan? Far be it from her to believe
this easily, and still more to lay aside her zeal, or change the
intention of her mind. What widow, when she learnt that there was no
profit in her widowhood, would choose to preserve her marriage faith and
live in sorrow, rather than give herself up to a happier condition? Who,
bound by the marriage-bond, if she hear that there is no honour in
chastity, might not be tempted by careless levity of body or mind? And
for this reason the Church in the holy lessons, and in the addresses of
her priests, proclaims the praise of chastity and the glory of
virginity.

<span id="v.xv-p23"></span>11. In vain, then, does the Apostle say: “I
wrote to you, in an Epistle, not to mingle with fornicators;” <span
id="fr_3655"></span>[3656](#fn_3655.md) and lest perchance they should say,
We are not speaking of all the fornicators of the world, but we say that
he who has been baptized in Christ ought not now to be esteemed a
fornicator, but his life, whatever it is, is accepted of God, <span
id="fr_3656"></span>[3657](#fn_3656.md) the Apostle has added “Not at all
\[meaning\] with the fornicators of this world,” and farther on, “If any
that is named a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolator, or
a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortioner, with such an one not even
to eat. For what have I to do with judging them that are without?” <span
id="fr_3657"></span>[3658](#fn_3657.md) And to the Ephesians: “But
fornication, and all uncleanness, and covetousness let it not even be
named among you, as becometh saints.” <span
id="fr_3658"></span>[3659](#fn_3658.md) And immediately he adds: “For this
ye know, that no immodest person, nor unclean, nor covetous, which is an
idolator, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of
God.” <span id="fr_3659"></span>[3660](#fn_3659.md) It is clear that this
is said of the baptized, for they receive the inheritance, who are
baptized into the death of Christ <span
id="fr_3660"></span>[3661](#fn_3660.md) and are buried together with Him,
that they may rise again with Him. Therefore they are heirs of God, and
joint heirs with Christ: <span id="fr_3661"></span>[3662](#fn_3661.md)
heirs of God, because the grace of Christ is conveyed to them;
joint-heirs with Christ, because they are renewed into His life; heirs
also of Christ; because to them is given by His death as it were the
inheritance of the testator.

<span id="v.xv-p31"></span>12. These then ought to take heed to
themselves who have that which they may lose, rather than they who have
it not. These ought to act with greater care, these ought to guard
against the allurements of vice, or incentives to error, which arise
chiefly from food and drink. For “the people sat down to eat and drink,
and rose up to play.” <span id="fr_3662"></span>[3663](#fn_3662.md)

<span id="v.xv-p33"></span>13. Epicurus <span
id="fr_3663"></span>[3664](#fn_3663.md) himself also, whom these persons
think they should follow rather than the apostles, the advocate of
pleasure, although he denies that pleasure brings in evil, does not deny
that certain things result from it from which evils are generated; and
asserts in fine that the life of the luxurious which is filled with
pleasures does not seem to be reprehensible, unless it be disturbed by
the fear either of pain or of death. But <span id="page_459">p.
459</span> <span id="v.xv-Page_459"></span>how far he is from the truth
is perceived even from this, that he asserts that pleasure was
originally created in man by God its author, as Philomarus <span
id="fr_3664"></span>[3665](#fn_3664.md) his follower argues in his Epitomæ,
asserting that the Stoics are the authors of this opinion.

<span id="v.xv-p36"></span>14. But Holy Scripture refutes this, for it
teaches us that pleasure was suggested to Adam and Eve by the craft and
enticements of the serpent. Since, indeed, the serpent itself is
pleasure, and therefore the passions of pleasure are various and
slippery, and as it were infected with the poison of corruptions, it is
certain then that Adam, being deceived by the desire of pleasure, fell
away from the commandment of God and from the enjoyment of grace. How
then can pleasure recall us to paradise, seeing that it alone deprived
us of it?

<span id="v.xv-p37"></span>15. Wherefore also the Lord Jesus, wishing to
make us more strong against the temptations of the devil, fasted when
about to contend with him, that we might know that we can in no other
way overcome the enticements of evil. Further, the devil himself hurled
the first dart of his temptations from the quiver of pleasure, saying:
“If Thou be the Son of God, command that these stones become
bread.” <span id="fr_3665"></span>[3666](#fn_3665.md) After which the Lord
said: “Man doth not live by bread alone, but by every word of
God;” <span id="fr_3666"></span>[3667](#fn_3666.md) and would not do it,
although He could, in order to teach us by a salutary precept to attend
rather to the pursuit of reading than to pleasure. And since they say
that we ought not to fast, let them prove for what cause Christ fasted,
unless it were that His fast might be an example to us. Lastly, in His
later words He taught us that evil cannot be easily overcome except by
our fasting, saying: “This kind of devils is not cast out but by prayer
and fasting.” <span id="fr_3667"></span>[3668](#fn_3667.md)

<span id="v.xv-p41"></span>16. And what is the intention of the
Scripture which teaches us that Peter fasted, and that the revelation
concerning the baptism of Gentiles was made to him when fasting and
praying, <span id="fr_3668"></span>[3669](#fn_3668.md) except to show that
the Saints themselves advance when they fast. Finally, Moses received
the Law when he was fasting; <span id="fr_3669"></span>[3670](#fn_3669.md)
and so Peter when fasting was taught the grace of the New Testament.
Daniel too by virtue of his fast stopped the mouths of the lions and saw
the events of future times. <span id="fr_3670"></span>[3671](#fn_3670.md)
And what safety can there be for us unless we wash away our sins by
fasting, since Scripture says that fasting and alms do away sin? <span
id="fr_3671"></span>[3672](#fn_3671.md)

<span id="v.xv-p46"></span>17. Who then are these new teachers who
reject the merit of fasting? Is it not the voice of heathen who say,
“Let us eat and drink?” whom the Apostle well ridicules, when he says:
“If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what
advantageth it me if the dead rise not? Let us eat and drink, for
to-morrow we die.” <span id="fr_3672"></span>[3673](#fn_3672.md) That is to
say, What profited me my contention even unto death, except that I might
redeem my body? And it is redeemed in vain if there is no hope of the
resurrection. And, consequently, if all hope of the resurrection is
lost, let us eat and drink, let us not lose the enjoyment of things
present, who have none of things to come. It is then for them to indulge
in meats and drinks who hope for nothing after death.

<span id="v.xv-p48"></span>18. Rightly then does the Apostle, arguing
against these men, warn us that we be not shaken by such opinions,
saying: “Be not deceived, evil communications corrupt good manners. Be
ye righteously sober and sin not, for some have no knowledge of
God.” <span id="fr_3673"></span>[3674](#fn_3673.md) Sobriety, then, is
good, for drunkenness is sin.

<span id="v.xv-p50"></span>19. But as to that Epicurus himself, the
defender of pleasure, of whom, therefore, we have made frequent mention
in order to prove that these men are either disciples of the heathen and
followers of the Epicurean sect or himself, whom the very philosophers
exclude from their company as the patron of luxury, what if we prove him
to be more tolerable than these men? He declares, as Demarchus <span
id="fr_3674"></span>[3675](#fn_3674.md) asserts, that neither drinking, nor
banquets, nor offspring, nor embraces of women, nor abundance of fish,
and other such like things which are prepared for the service of a
sumptuous banquet, make life sweet, but sober discussion. Lastly, he
added that those who do not use the banquets of society in excess, use
them with moderation. He who willingly makes use of the juices of plants
alone together with bread and water, despises feasts on delicacies, for
many inconveniences arise from them. In another place they also say: It
is not excessive banquets, nor drinking which give rise to the enjoyment
of pleasure, but a life of temperance.

<span id="v.xv-p52"></span>20. Since, then, philosophy has disowned
those men, is the Church not to exclude them? Seeing, too, that they,
because they <span id="page_460">p. 460</span> <span
id="v.xv-Page_460"></span>have a bad cause, frequently fall foul of
themselves by their own assertions. For, although their chief opinion is
that there is no enjoyment of pleasure except such as is derived from
eating and drinking, yet understanding that they cannot, without the
greatest shame, cling to so disgraceful a definition, and that they are
forsaken by all, they have tried to colour it with a sort of stain of
specious arguments; so that one of them has said: Whilst we are aiming
at pleasure by means of banquets and songs, we have lost that which is
infused into us by the reception of the Word, whereby alone we can be
saved.

<span id="v.xv-p53"></span>21. Do not they by these various arguments
show themselves to us as differing and disagreeing one with the other?
And Scripture too condemns them, not passing over those whom the Apostle
refuted, as Luke, who wrote the book as a history, tells us in the Acts
of the Apostles, “And certain also of the Epicurean and Stoic
philosophers disputed with him. And some said, What does this babbler
mean? And others said, He seemeth to be a setter forth of new
gods.” <span id="fr_3675"></span>[3676](#fn_3675.md)

<span id="v.xv-p55"></span>22. Yet from this hand too the Apostle did
not go forth without success, since even Dionysius the Areopagite
together with his wife Damaris and many others believed. And so that
company of most learned and eloquent men showed themselves overcome in a
simple discussion by the example of those who believed. What then do
those men mean, who endeavour to prevent those whom the Apostle has
gained, and whom Christ has redeemed with His own blood? asserting that
the baptized ought not to give themselves to the discipline of the
virtues, that revellings injure them not, nor abundance of pleasures;
that they are foolish who go without them, that virgins ought to marry,
bear children, and likewise widows to repeat that converse with man
which they have once experienced with ill results; and that even if they
can contain, they are in error who will not again enter the marriage
bond.

<span id="v.xv-p56"></span>23. What then? Would you have us put off the
man in order to put on the beast, and stripping ourselves of Christ,
clothe ourselves or be superclothed with the garments of the devil? But
since the very teachers of the heathen did not think that honour and
pleasure could be joined together, because they would seem thus to class
beasts with men, shall we as it were infuse the habits of beasts into
the human breast, and inscribe on the reasonable mind the unreasoning
ways of wild beasts?

<span id="v.xv-p57"></span>24. And yet there are many kinds of animals,
which, when they have lost their fellow, will not mate again, and spend
their time as it were in solitary life; many too live on simple herbs,
and will not quench their thirst except at a pure stream; one can also
often see dogs refrain from food forbidden them, so that they close
their famishing mouths if restraint is bidden them. Must men then be
warned against that wherein brutes have learned not to transgress?

<span id="v.xv-p58"></span>26. But what is more admirable than
abstinence, which makes even the years of youth to ripen, so that there
is an old age of character? For as by excess of food and by drunkenness
even mature age is excited, so the wildness of youth is lessened by
scanty feasts and by the running stream. An external fire is
extinguished by pouring on water, it is then no wonder if the inward
heat of the body is cooled by draughts from the stream, for the flame is
fed or fails according to the fuel. As hay, straw, wood, oil, and such
like things are the nourishment which feeds fire, if you take them away,
or do not supply them, the fire is extinguished. In like manner then the
heat of the body is supported or lessened by food, it is excited by food
and lessened by food. Luxury then is the mother of lust.

<span id="v.xv-p59"></span>27. And is not temperance agreeable to
nature, and to that divine law, which in the very beginning of all
created things gave the springs for drink and the fruits of the trees
for food? After the Flood the just man found wine a source of temptation
to him. <span id="fr_3676"></span>[3677](#fn_3676.md) Let us then use the
natural drink of temperance, and would that we all were able to do so.
But because all are not strong the Apostle said: “Use a little wine
because of thy frequent infirmities.” <span
id="fr_3677"></span>[3678](#fn_3677.md) We must drink it then not for the
sake of pleasure, but because of infirmity, and therefore sparingly as a
remedy, not in excess as a gratification.

<span id="v.xv-p62"></span>28. Lastly, Elijah, whom the Lord was
training to the perfection of virtue, found at his head a cake and a
cruse of water; and then fasted in the strength of that food forty days
and forty nights. <span id="fr_3678"></span>[3679](#fn_3678.md) Our
fathers, when they passed across the sea on foot, <span
id="fr_3679"></span>[3680](#fn_3679.md) drank water not wine. Daniel and
the Hebrew children, fed with their peculiar food, <span
id="fr_3680"></span>[3681](#fn_3680.md) and with water to drink, overcame,
the former the fury of the lions; <span
id="fr_3681"></span>[3682](#fn_3681.md) the latter saw the <span
id="page_461">p. 461</span> <span id="v.xv-Page_461"></span>burning fire
play around their limbs with harmless touch. <span
id="fr_3682"></span>[3683](#fn_3682.md)

<span id="v.xv-p68"></span>29. And why should I speak of men? Judith, in
no way moved by the luxurious banquet of Holophernes, carried off the
triumph of which men’s arms despaired, solely in right of her
temperance; delivered her country from occupation and slew the leader of
the expedition with her own hands. <span
id="fr_3683"></span>[3684](#fn_3683.md) A clear proof both that his luxury
had enervated that warrior, terrible to the nations, and that temperance
made this woman stronger than men. In this case it was not in her sex
that nature was surpassed, but she overcame by her diet. Esther by her
fasts moved a proud king. <span id="fr_3684"></span>[3685](#fn_3684.md)
Anna, who for eighty-four years in her widowhood had served God with
fasts and prayers day and night in the temple, <span
id="fr_3685"></span>[3686](#fn_3685.md) recognized Christ, Whom John, the
master of abstinence, and as it were a new angel on earth, announced.

<span id="v.xv-p72"></span>30. O foolish Elisha, for feeding the
prophets with wild and bitter gourds! <span
id="fr_3686"></span>[3687](#fn_3686.md) O Ezra forgetful of Scripture,
though he did restore the Scriptures from memory! <span
id="fr_3687"></span>[3688](#fn_3687.md) foolish Paul, who glories in
fastings, <span id="fr_3688"></span>[3689](#fn_3688.md) if fastings profit
nothing.

<span id="v.xv-p76"></span>31. But how should that not be profitable by
which our sins are purged? And if you offer this with humility and with
mercy, your bones, as Isaiah said, shall be fat, and you shall be like a
well-watered garden. <span id="fr_3689"></span>[3690](#fn_3689.md) So,
then, your soul shall grow fat and its virtues also by the spiritual
richness of fasting, and your fruits shall be multiplied by the
fertility of your mind, so that there may be in you the inebriation of
soberness, like that cup of which the Prophet says: “Thy cup which
inebriates, how excellent it is!” <span
id="fr_3690"></span>[3691](#fn_3690.md)

<span id="v.xv-p79"></span>32. But not only is that temperance worthy of
praise which moderates food, but also that which moderates lust. Since
it is written: “Go not after thy lusts, and deny thy appetite. If thou
givest her desires to thy soul, thou wilt be a joy to thine
enemies;” <span id="fr_3691"></span>[3692](#fn_3691.md) and farther on;
“Wine and women make even wise men to fall away.” <span
id="fr_3692"></span>[3693](#fn_3692.md) So that Paul teaches temperance
even in marriage itself; for he who is incontinent in marriage is a kind
of adulterer, and violates the law of the Apostle.

<span id="v.xv-p82"></span>33. And why should I tell how great is the
grace of virginity, which was found worthy to be chosen by Christ, that
it might be even the bodily temple of God, in which as we read the
fulness of the Godhead dwelt bodily. <span
id="fr_3693"></span>[3694](#fn_3693.md) A Virgin conceived the Salvation of
the world, a Virgin brought forth the life of all. Virginity then ought
not to be left to itself, seeing that it benefited all in Christ. A
Virgin bore Him Whom this world cannot contain or support. And when He
was born from His mother’s womb, He yet preserved the fence of her
chastity and the inviolate seal of her virginity. And so Christ found in
the Virgin that which He willed to make His own, that which the Lord of
all might take to Himself. Further, our flesh was cast out of Paradise
by a man and woman and was joined to God through a Virgin.

<span id="v.xv-p84"></span>34. What shall I say concerning the other
Mary, <span id="fr_3694"></span>[3695](#fn_3694.md) the sister of Moses,
who as leader of the women passed on foot the straits of the sea? <span
id="fr_3695"></span>[3696](#fn_3695.md) By the same gift Thecla also was
reverenced by the lions, so that the unfed beasts stretched at the feet
of their prey prolonged a holy fast, and harmed the virgin neither with
wanton look nor claw, since virginity is injured even by a look.

<span id="v.xv-p87"></span>35. Again, with what reverence for virginity
has the holy Apostle spoken: “Concerning virgins I have no commandment
of the Lord, but I give my counsel, as having obtained mercy of the
Lord.” <span id="fr_3696"></span>[3697](#fn_3696.md) He has received no
commandment, but a counsel, for that which beyond the law is not
commanded, but is rather advised by way of counsel. Authority is not
assumed but grace is shown, and this is not shown by anyone, but by him
who obtained mercy from the Lord. Are then the counsels of these men
better than those of the apostles? The Apostle says, “I give my
counsel,” but they think it right to dissuade any from cultivating
virginity.

<span id="v.xv-p89"></span>36. And we ought to recognize what
commendation of it the prophet, or rather Christ in the prophet, has
uttered in a short verse; “A garden enclosed,” says He, “is My sister,
My spouse, a garden enclosed, a sealed fountain.” <span
id="fr_3697"></span>[3698](#fn_3697.md) Christ says this to the Church,
which he desires to be a virgin, without spot, without a wrinkle. A
fertile garden is virginity, which can bear many fruits of good odour. A
garden enclosed, because it is everywhere shut in by the wall of
chastity. A sealed fountain, because virginity is the source and origin
of modesty, having to keep inviolate the seal of purity, in which source
the image of God is reflected, since the purity of simplicity agrees
also with chastity of the body.

<span id="v.xv-p91"></span><span id="page_462">p. 462</span> <span
id="v.xv-Page_462"></span>37. And no one can doubt that the Church is a
virgin, who also in the Epistle to the Corinthians is espoused and
presented as a chaste virgin to Christ. <span
id="fr_3698"></span>[3699](#fn_3698.md) So in the first Epistle he gives
his counsel, and esteems the gift of virginity as good, since it is not
disturbed by any troubles of the present time, nor polluted by any of
its defilements, nor shaken by any storms; in the later Epistle he
brings a spouse to Christ, because he is able to certify the virginity
of the Church in the purity of that people.

<span id="v.xv-p93"></span>38. Answer me now, O Paul, in what way thou
givest counsel for the present distress. <span
id="fr_3699"></span>[3700](#fn_3699.md) “Because he that is without a wife
is careful,” he says, “for the things of the Lord, how he may please
God.” And he adds, “The unmarried woman and the virgin think of the
things of the Lord, that they may be holy in body and spirit.” <span
id="fr_3700"></span>[3701](#fn_3700.md) She has then her wall against the
tempests of this world, and so fortified by the defence of divine
protection she is disturbed by none of the blasts of this world. Good
then is counsel, because there is advantage in counsel, but there is a
bond in a commandment. Counsel attracts the willing, commandment binds
the unwilling. If then anyone has followed counsel, and not repented,
she has gained an advantage; but if she has repented, she has no ground
for blaming the Apostle, for she ought herself to have judged of her own
weakness; and so she is responsible for her own will, inasmuch as she
bound herself by a bond and knot beyond her power to bear.

<span id="v.xv-p96"></span>39. And so like a good physician, desiring to
preserve the stability of virtue in the strong, and to give health to
the weak, he gives counsel to the one, and points out the remedy to the
others: “He that is weak eateth herbs,” <span
id="fr_3701"></span>[3702](#fn_3701.md) let him take a wife; he that has
more power let him seek the stronger meat of virtue. And rightly he
added: “For he who being steadfast hath settled in his own heart, having
no necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath determined this
in his own heart, to keep his own virgin, doeth well. So then both he
who giveth his own virgin in marriage, doeth well; and he that giveth
her not in marriage, doeth better. A woman is bound by the law, for so
long a time as her husband liveth. But if her husband have fallen
asleep, she is freed, let her marry whom she will, only in the Lord. But
she will be more happy if she abide as she is, after my counsel, for I
think that I also have the Spirit of the Lord.” <span
id="fr_3702"></span>[3703](#fn_3702.md) This is to have the counsel of God,
to search diligently into all things, and to advise things that are
best, and to point out those that are safest.

<span id="v.xv-p99"></span>40. A careful guide points out many paths,
that each may walk along the one which he prefers and considers suitable
to himself, so long as he comes upon one by which he can reach the camp.
The path of virginity is good, but being high and steep requires the
stronger wayfarers. Good also is that of widowhood, not so difficult as
the former, but being rocky and rough, it requires more cautious
travellers. Good too is that of marriage; being smooth and even it
reaches the camp of the saints by a longer circuit. This way is taken by
most. There are then the rewards of virginity, there are the merits of
widowhood, there is also a place for conjugal modesty. There are steps
and advances in each and every virtue.

<span id="v.xv-p100"></span>41. Stand therefore firm in your hearts,
that no one overthrow you, that no one be able to make you fall. The
Apostle has taught us what it is “to stand,” that is what was said to
Moses: “The place whereon thou standest is holy ground;” <span
id="fr_3703"></span>[3704](#fn_3703.md) for no one stands unless he stand
by faith, unless he stands fixed in the determination of his own heart.
In another place also we read: “But do thou stand here with Me.” <span
id="fr_3704"></span>[3705](#fn_3704.md) Each sentence was spoken by the
Lord to Moses, both “Where thou standest is holy ground,” and “Stand
here with Me,” that is, thou standest with Me, if thou stand firm in the
Church. For the very place is holy, the very ground is fruitful with
sanctity and fertile with harvests of virtues.

<span id="v.xv-p103"></span>42. Stand then in the Church, stand where I
appeared to thee, where I am with thee. Where the Church is, there is
the most solid resting place for thy mind, there the support of thy
soul, where I appeared to thee in the bush. Thou art the bush, I am the
fire; the fire in the bush, I in the flesh. Therefore am I the fire,
that I may give light to thee, that I may consume thy thorns, that is,
thy sins, and show thee My grace.

<span id="v.xv-p104"></span>43. Standing firm then in your hearts, drive
away from the Church the wolves which seek to carry off prey. Let there
be no sloth in you, let not your mouth be evil nor your tongue bitter.
Do not sit in the council of vanity; for it is written, “I have not sat
in the council of vanity.” <span id="fr_3705"></span>[3706](#fn_3705.md) Do
not listen to those who speak against their neighbours, <span
id="page_463">p. 463</span> <span id="v.xv-Page_463"></span>lest whilst
you listen to others, you be stirred up yourselves to speak against your
neighbours, and it be said to each of you: “Thou satest and spakest
against thy brother.” <span id="fr_3706"></span>[3707](#fn_3706.md)

<span id="v.xv-p107"></span>44. Men sit when speaking against others,
they stand when they praise the Lord, to whom it is said: “Behold now,
praise the Lord, all ye servants of the Lord, ye that stand in the house
of the Lord.” <span id="fr_3707"></span>[3708](#fn_3707.md) He who sits, to
speak of the bodily habit, is as it were loosened by ease, and relaxes
the energy of his mind. But the careful watchman, the active searcher,
the watchful guardian, who keeps the outposts of the camp, stands. The
zealous warrior, too, who desires to anticipate the designs of the
enemy, stands in array before he is expected.

<span id="v.xv-p109"></span>45. “Let him that standeth take heed lest he
fall.” <span id="fr_3708"></span>[3709](#fn_3708.md) He who stands does not
give way to detraction, for it is the tales of those at ease in which
detraction is spread abroad, and malignity betrayed. So that the prophet
says: “I have hated the congregation of the malignant, and will not sit
with the ungodly.” <span id="fr_3709"></span>[3710](#fn_3709.md) And in the
thirty-sixth Psalm, which he has filled with moral precepts, he has put
at the very beginning: “Be not malignant amongst the malignant, neither
be envious of those who do iniquity.” <span
id="fr_3710"></span>[3711](#fn_3710.md) Malignancy is more harmful than
malice, because malignancy has neither pure simplicity nor open malice,
but a hidden ill-will. And it is more difficult to guard against what is
hidden than against what is known. For which reason too our Saviour
warns us to beware of malignant spirits, because they would catch us by
the appearance of sweet pleasures and a show of other things, when they
hold forth honour to entice us to ambition, riches to avarice, power to
pride.

<span id="v.xv-p113"></span>46. And so both in every action, and
especially in the demand for a bishop, by whom \[as a pattern\] the life
of all is formed; malignity ought to be absent; so that the man who is
to be elected out of all, and to heal all, may be preferred to all by a
calm and peaceful decision. For “the meek man is the physician of the
heart.” <span id="fr_3711"></span>[3712](#fn_3711.md) And the Lord in the
Gospel called Himself this, when He said: “They that be whole need not a
physician, but they that are sick.” <span
id="fr_3712"></span>[3713](#fn_3712.md)

<span id="v.xv-p116"></span>47. He is the good Physician, Who has taken
upon Him our infirmities, has healed our sicknesses, and yet He, as it
is written, honoured not Himself to be made a High Priest, but He Who
spake to Him. The Father said: “Thou art My Son, this day have I
begotten Thee.” <span id="fr_3713"></span>[3714](#fn_3713.md) As He said in
another place: “Thou art a Priest for ever after the order of
Melchisedech.” Who, since He was the type of all future priests, took
our flesh upon Him, that “in the days of His flesh He might offer
prayers and supplications with a loud voice and tears; and by those
things which He suffered, though He was the Son of God, might seem to
learn obedience, which He taught us, that He might be made to us the
Author of Salvation.” <span id="fr_3714"></span>[3715](#fn_3714.md) And at
last when His sufferings were completed, as though completed and made
perfect Himself, He gave health to all, He bore the sin of all.

<span id="v.xv-p119"></span>48. And so He Himself also chose Aaron as
priest, that not the will of man but the grace of God should have the
chief part in the election of the priest; <span
id="fr_3715"></span>[3716](#fn_3715.md) not the voluntary offering of
himself, nor the taking it upon himself, but the vocation from heaven,
that he should offer gifts for sins who could be touched for those who
sinned, for He Himself, it is said, bears our weakness. <span
id="fr_3716"></span>[3717](#fn_3716.md) No one ought to take this honour
upon himself but they are called of God, as was Aaron, <span
id="fr_3717"></span>[3718](#fn_3717.md) and so Christ did not demand but
received the priesthood.

<span id="v.xv-p123"></span>49. Lastly, when the succession derived
through family descent from Aaron, contained rather heirs of the family
than sharers in his righteousness, there came, after the likeness of
that Melchisedech, of whom we read in the Old Testament, the true
Melchisedech, the true King of peace, the true King of righteousness,
for this is the interpretation of the Name, “without father, without
mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of
life,” <span id="fr_3718"></span>[3719](#fn_3718.md) which also refers to
the Son of God, Who in His Divine Generation had no mother, was in His
Birth of the Virgin Mary without a father; begotten before the ages of
the Father alone, born in this age of the Virgin alone, and certainly
could have no beginning of days seeing He “was in the beginning.” <span
id="fr_3719"></span>[3720](#fn_3719.md) And how could He have any end of
life, Who is the Author of life to all? He is “the Beginning and the
Ending.” <span id="fr_3720"></span>[3721](#fn_3720.md) But this also is
referred to Him as an example, that a priest ought to be without father
and without mother, since in him it is not nobility of family, but
holi<span id="page_464">p. 464</span> <span
id="v.xv-Page_464"></span>ness of character and pre-eminence in virtue
which is elected.

<span id="v.xv-p127"></span>50. Let there be in him faith and ripeness
of character, not one without the other, but let both meet together in
one with good works and deeds. For which reason the Apostle Paul wishes
that we should be imitators of them, who, as he says, “by faith and
patience” <span id="fr_3721"></span>[3722](#fn_3721.md) possess the
promises made to Abraham, who by patience was found worthy to receive
and to possess the grace of the blessing promised to him. David the
prophet warns us that we should be imitators of holy Aaron, and has set
him amongst the Saints of God to be imitated by us, saying: “Moses and
Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among those that call upon His
Name.” <span id="fr_3722"></span>[3723](#fn_3722.md)

<span id="v.xv-p130"></span>51. A man clearly worthy to be proposed that
all should follow him was he, for when a terrible death on account of
the rebels was spreading over the people, he offered himself between the
dead and the living, that he might arrest death, and that no more should
perish. <span id="fr_3723"></span>[3724](#fn_3723.md) A man truly of
priestly mind and soul, who as a good shepherd with pious affection
offered himself for the Lord’s flock. And so he broke the sting of
death, restrained its violence, refused it further course. Affection
aided his deserts, for he offered himself for those who were resisting
him.

<span id="v.xv-p132"></span>52. Let those then who dissent learn to fear
to rouse up the Lord, and to appease His priests. What! did not the
earthquake swallow up Dathan, Abiron, and Korah because of their
dissension? <span id="fr_3724"></span>[3725](#fn_3724.md) For when Korah,
Dathan, and Abiron had stirred up two hundred and fifty men against
Moses and Aaron to separate themselves from them, they rose up against
them and said: “Let it suffice you that all the congregation are holy,
every one, and the Lord is amongst them.” <span
id="fr_3725"></span>[3726](#fn_3725.md)

<span id="v.xv-p135"></span>53. Whereupon the Lord was angry and spoke
to the whole congregation. The Lord considered and knew those that were
His, and drew His saints to Himself; and those whom He chose not, He did
not draw to Himself. And the Lord commanded that Korah and all those who
had risen up with him against Moses and Aaron the priests of the Lord
should take to themselves censers, and put on incense, <span
id="fr_3726"></span>[3727](#fn_3726.md) that he who was chosen of the Lord
might be established as holy among the Levites of the Lord.

<span id="v.xv-p137"></span>54. And Moses said to Korah: “Hear me, ye
sons of Levi: Is this a small thing unto you, that God hath separated
you from the congregation of Israel, and brought you near to Himself, to
minister the service of the Tabernacle of the Lord.” <span
id="fr_3727"></span>[3728](#fn_3727.md) And farther on, “Seek ye the
priesthood also, so that thou and all thy congregation are gathered
against the Lord. And what is Aaron that ye murmur about him?” <span
id="fr_3728"></span>[3729](#fn_3728.md)

<span id="v.xv-p140"></span>55. Considering, then, what causes of
offence existed, that unworthy persons desired to discharge the offices
of the priesthood, and therefore were causing dissensions; and were
murmuring in censure of the judgment of God in the choice of His priest,
the whole people were seized with a great fear, and dread of punishment
came upon them all. But when all implore that all perish not for the
insolence of few, those guilty of the wickedness are marked out; and two
hundred and fifty men with their leaders are separated from the whole
body of the people; and then the earth with a groan cleaves asunder in
the midst of the people, a deep gulf opens, the offenders are swallowed
up, and are so removed from all the elements of this world, as neither
to pollute the air by breathing it, nor the heavens by beholding them,
nor the sea by their touch, nor the earth by their sepulchres.

<span id="v.xv-p141"></span>56. The punishment ceased, but the
wickedness ceased not; for from this very thing a murmuring rose among
them that the people had perished through the priests. In His wrath at
this, the Lord would have destroyed them all, had He not been moved
first by the prayers of Moses and Aaron, and afterwards also at the
intervention of His priest Aaron (the humiliation of their forgiveness
being thereby greater), He willed to give their lives to those whose
privilege they had repudiated.

<span id="v.xv-p142"></span>57. Miriam the prophetess herself, who with
her brothers had crossed the straits of the sea on foot, because, being
still ignorant of the mystery of the Ethiopian woman, she had murmured
against her brother Moses, broke out with leprous spots, <span
id="fr_3729"></span>[3730](#fn_3729.md) so that she would scarcely have
been freed from so great a plague, unless Moses had prayed for her.
Although this murmuring refers to the type of the Synagogue, which is
ignorant of the mystery of that Ethiopian woman, that is the Church
gathered out of the nations, and murmurs with daily reproaches, and
envies that people through whose faith itself also shall be delivered
<span id="page_465">p. 465</span> <span id="v.xv-Page_465"></span>from
the leprosy of its unbelief, according to what we read that: “blindness
in part has happened unto Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be
come in, and so all Israel shall be saved.” <span
id="fr_3730"></span>[3731](#fn_3730.md)

<span id="v.xv-p145"></span>58. And that we may observe that divine
grace rather than human works in priests, of the many rods which Moses
had received according to the Tribes, and had laid up, that of Aaron
alone blossomed. And so the people saw that the gift of the Divine
vocation is to be looked for in a priest, and ceased from claiming equal
grace for a human choice though they had before thought that a similar
prerogative belonged to themselves. But what else does that rod show,
but that priestly grace never decays, and in the deepest lowliness has
in its office the flower of the power committed to it, or that this also
is refered to in mystery? Nor do we think that it was without a purpose
that this took place near the end of the life of Aaron the priest. It
seems to be shown that the ancient people, full of decay through the
oldness of the long-continued unfaithfulness of the priests, being
fashioned again in the last times to zeal in faith and devotion by the
example of the Church, will again send forth with revived grace its
flowers dead through so many ages.

<span id="v.xv-p146"></span>59. But what does this signify, that after
Aaron was dead, the Lord commanded, not the whole people, but Moses
alone, who is amongst the priests, to clothe Aaron’s son Eleazar with
the priest’s garments, except that we should understand that priest must
consecrate priest, and himself clothe him with the vestments, that is,
with priestly virtues; and then, if he has seen that nothing is wanting
to him of the priestly garments, and that all things are perfect, should
admit him to the sacred altars. For he who is to supplicate for the
people ought to be chosen of God and approved by the priests, lest there
be anything which might give serious offence in him whose office it is
to intercede for the offences of others. For the virtue of a priest must
be of no ordinary kind, since he has to guard not only from nearness to
greater faults, but even the very least. He must also be prompt to have
pity, not recall a promise, restore the fallen, have sympathy with pain,
preserve meekness, love piety, repel or keep down anger, must be as it
were a trumpet to excite the people to devotion, or to soothe them to
tranquillity.

<span id="v.xv-p147"></span>60. It is an old saying: Accustom yourself
to be consistent, that your life may set forth as it were a picture,
always preserving the same representation which it has received. How can
he be consistent who at one time is inflamed by anger, at another blazes
up with fierce indignation, whose face now burns, and now again is
changed to paleness, varying and changing colour every moment? But let
it be so, let it be natural for one to be angry, or that there is
generally a cause, it is a man’s duty to restrain anger, and not to be
carried away like a lion by fury, so as not to know to be quieted, not
to spread tales, nor to embitter family quarrels; for it is written: “A
wrathful man diggeth up sin.” <span id="fr_3731"></span>[3732](#fn_3731.md)
He will not be consistent who is double-minded; he cannot be consistent
who cannot restrain himself when angry, as to which David well says: “Be
ye angry and sin not.” <span id="fr_3732"></span>[3733](#fn_3732.md) He
does not govern his anger, but indulges his natural disposition, which a
man cannot indeed prevent but may moderate. Therefore even though we are
angry, let our passion admit only such emotion as is according to
nature, not sin contrary to nature. For who would endure that he should
not be able to govern himself, who has undertaken to govern others?

<span id="v.xv-p150"></span>61. And so the Apostle has given a pattern,
saying that a bishop must be blameless, <span
id="fr_3733"></span>[3734](#fn_3733.md) and in another place: “A bishop
must be without offence, as a steward of God, not proud, not soon angry,
not given to wine, not a striker, not greedy of filthy lucre.” <span
id="fr_3734"></span>[3735](#fn_3734.md) For how can the compassion of a
dispenser of alms and the avarice of a covetous man agree together?

<span id="v.xv-p153"></span>62. I have set down these things which I
have been told are to be avoided, but the Apostle is the Master of
virtues, and he teaches that gainsayers are to be convicted with
patience, <span id="fr_3735"></span>[3736](#fn_3735.md) who lays down that
one should be the husband of a single wife, <span
id="fr_3736"></span>[3737](#fn_3736.md) not in order to exclude him from
the right of marriage (for this is beyond the force of the precept), but
that by conjugal chastity he may preserve the grace of his baptismal
washing; nor again that he may be induced by the Apostle’s authority to
beget children in the priesthood; for he speaks of having children, not
of begetting them, or marrying again.

<span id="v.xv-p156"></span>63. And I have thought it well not to pass
by this point, because many contend that having one wife is said of the
time after Baptism; so that the fault whereby any <span id="page_466">p.
466</span> <span id="v.xv-Page_466"></span>obstacle would ensue would be
washed away in baptism. And indeed all faults and sins are washed away;
so that if anyone have polluted his body with very many whom he has
bound to himself by no law of marriage, all the sins are forgiven him,
but if any one have contracted a second marriage it is not done away;
for sin not law is loosed by the laver, and as to baptism there is no
sin but law. That then which has to do with law is not remitted as
though it were sin, but is retained. And the Apostle has established a
law, saying: “If any man be without reproach the husband of one
wife.” <span id="fr_3737"></span>[3738](#fn_3737.md) So then he who is
without blame the husband of one wife comes within the rule for
undertaking the priestly office; he, however, who has married again has
no guilt of pollution, but is disqualified for the priestly prerogative.

<span id="v.xv-p158"></span>64. We have stated what is according to the
law, let us state in addition what is according to reason. But first we
must notice that not only has the Apostle laid down this rule concerning
a bishop or priest, but that the Fathers in the Nicene Council <span
id="fr_3738"></span>[3739](#fn_3738.md) added that no one who has
contracted a second marriage ought to be admitted amongst the clergy at
all. For how can he comfort or honour a widow, or exhort her to preserve
her widowhood, and the faith pledged to her husband, which he himself
has not kept in regard to his former marriage? Or what difference would
there be between people and priest, if they were bound by the same laws?
The life of a priest ought to excel that of others as does his grace,
for he who binds others by his precepts ought himself to keep the
precepts of the law.

<span id="v.xv-p160"></span>65. How I resisted my ordination, and
lastly, when I was compelled, endeavoured that it might at least be
deferred, but the prescribed rule did not prevail against the popular
eagerness. Yet the Western Bishops approved of my ordination by their
decision, the Eastern by an example of the same kind. <span
id="fr_3739"></span>[3740](#fn_3739.md) And yet the ordination of a
neophyte is forbidden, lest he should be lifted up by pride. <span
id="fr_3740"></span>[3741](#fn_3740.md) If the ordination was not postponed
it was because of constraint, and if humility suitable to the priestly
office be not wanting, where there is no reason blame will not be
imputed to him.

<span id="v.xv-p163"></span>66. But if so much consideration is needed
in other churches for the ordination of a bishop, how much care is
required in the Church of Vercellæ, where two things seem to be equally
required of the bishop, monastic rule and church discipline? For
Eusebius of holy memory was the first in Western lands to bring together
these differing matters, both while living in the city observing the
rules of the monks, and ruling the Church with fasting and temperance.
For the grace of the priesthood is much increased if the bishop
constrain young men to the practice of abstinence, and to the rule of
purity; and forbid them though living in the city, the manners and mode
of life of the city.

<span id="v.xv-p164"></span>67. From such a rule sprang those great men,
Elijah, Elisha, John the son of Elizabeth, who clothed in sheepskins,
poor and needy, and afflicted with pain, wandered in deserts, <span
id="fr_3741"></span>[3742](#fn_3741.md) in hollows and thickets of
mountains, amongst pathless rocks, rough caves, pitfalls and marshes, of
whom the world was not worthy. From the same, Daniel, Ananias, Azarias,
and Misael, <span id="fr_3742"></span>[3743](#fn_3742.md) who were brought
up in the royal palace, were fed meagrely as though in the desert, with
coarse food, and ordinary drink. Rightly did those royal slaves prevail
over kingdoms, despise captivity, shaking off its yoke, subdue powers,
conquer the elements, quench the nature of fire, dull the flames, blunt
the edge of the sword, stop the mouths of lions; <span
id="fr_3743"></span>[3744](#fn_3743.md) they were found most strong when
esteemed to be most weak, and did not shrink from the mockings of men,
because they looked for heavenly rewards; they did not dread the
darkness of the prison, on whom was shining the beauty of eternal light.

<span id="v.xv-p168"></span>68. Following these, holy Eusebius went
forth out of his country, and from his own relatives, and preferred a
foreign wandering to ease at home. For the faith also he preferred and
chose the hardships of exile, in conjunction with Dionysius <span
id="fr_3744"></span>[3745](#fn_3744.md) of holy memory, who esteemed a
voluntary exile above an Emperor’s friendship. And so these illustrious
men, surrounded with arms, closed in by soldiers, when torn away from
the larger <span id="page_467">p. 467</span> <span
id="v.xv-Page_467"></span>Church, triumphed over the imperial power,
because by earthly shame they purchased fortitude of soul, and kingly
power; they from whom the band of soldiers and the din of arms could not
tear away the faith subdued the raging of the brutal mind, which was
unable to hurt the saints. For, as you read in Proverbs, “the king’s
wrath is as the wrath of a lion.” <span
id="fr_3745"></span>[3746](#fn_3745.md)

<span id="v.xv-p171"></span>69. He confessed that he was overcome when
he asked them to change their determination, but they thought their pen
stronger than swords of iron. Then it was unbelief which was wounded so
that it fell, not the faith of the saints; they did not desire a tomb in
their own country, for whom was reserved a home in the heavens. They
wandered over the whole earth, “having nothing and yet possessing all
things.” <span id="fr_3746"></span>[3747](#fn_3746.md) Wherever they were
sent, they esteemed it a place full of delights, for nothing was wanting
to them in whom the riches of faith abounded. Lastly, they enriched
others, being themselves poor as to earthly means, rich in grace. They
were tried but not killed, in fasting, in labours, in watchings, in
vigils. Out of weakness they came forth strong. They did not wait for
the enticements of pleasure who were satiated by fasting; the burning
summer did not parch those whom the hope of eternal grace refreshed, nor
did the cold of icy regions break them down, whose devotion was ever
budding afresh with glowing devotion; they feared not the chains of men
whom Jesus had set free; they desired not to be rescued from death, who
expected to be raised again by Christ.

<span id="v.xv-p173"></span>70. And at last holy Dionysius requested in
his prayers, that he might end his life in exile, for fear that he
might, if he returned home, find the minds of the people or the clergy
disturbed through the teaching or practice of the unbelievers, and he
obtained this favour, so that he bore with him the peace of the Lord
with a quiet mind. Thus as holy Eusebius first raised the standard of
confessorship, so blessed Dionysius in his exile gave up his life with
honour higher even than martyrs.

<span id="v.xv-p174"></span>71. Now this patience in holy Eusebius grew
strong by the discipline of the monastery, and from the custom of hard
endurance he derived the power of enduring hardships. For who doubts
that in stricter Christian devotion these two things are the most
excellent, the offices of the clergy and the rule of the monks? The
former is a discipline which accustoms to courteousness and good morals,
the latter to abstinence and patience; the former as it were on an open
stage, the latter in secret; the one is visible, the other hidden. And
so he who was a good athlete said: “We are made a spectacle to this
world and to Angels.” <span id="fr_3747"></span>[3748](#fn_3747.md) Worthy
indeed was he to be gazed upon by Angels, when he was striving to attain
the prize of Christ, when he was striving to lead on earth the life of
Angels, and overcome the wickedness of spirits in heaven, for he
wrestled with spiritual wickedness. <span
id="fr_3748"></span>[3749](#fn_3748.md) Rightly did the world gaze upon
him, that it might imitate him.

<span id="v.xv-p177"></span>72. The one life, then, is on the open
arena, the other hidden as in a cave; the one is opposed to the
confusion of the world, the other to the desires of the flesh; the one
subdues, the other shuns the pleasures of the body; the one was more
agreeable, the other more safe; the one ruling, the other restraining
itself, in order to be wholly Christ’s, for to the perfect it is said:
“He who will come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross
and follow Me.” <span id="fr_3749"></span>[3750](#fn_3749.md) Now he
follows Christ who is able to say: “It is no longer I that live, but
Christ liveth in me.” <span id="fr_3750"></span>[3751](#fn_3750.md)

<span id="v.xv-p180"></span>73. Paul denied himself, when, knowing that
chains and tribulations awaited him in Jerusalem, he willingly offered
himself to danger, saying: “Nor do I count my life dear to myself, if
only I can accomplish my course, and the ministry of the Word, which I
have received of the Lord Jesus.” <span
id="fr_3751"></span>[3752](#fn_3751.md) And at last, though many were
standing round, weeping and beseeching him, he did not change his mind,
so stern a censor of itself is ready faith.

<span id="v.xv-p182"></span>74. The one then contends, the other
retires; the one overcomes incitements, the other flees from them; by
the one the world is triumphed over, the other rejoices over it; to the
one the world is crucified, or itself is crucified to the world, <span
id="fr_3752"></span>[3753](#fn_3752.md) to the other it is unknown; the one
endures more frequent temptations, and so has the greater victory, the
other falls less often, and keeps guard more easily.

<span id="v.xv-p184"></span>75. Elijah himself too, that the word spoken
by his mouth might be confirmed, was sent by the Lord to hide himself by
the brook Cherith. <span id="fr_3753"></span>[3754](#fn_3753.md) Ahab
threatened, Jezebel threatened, Elijah was afraid and rose up, and then
“went in the strength of that spiritual meat forty days and forty nights
<span id="page_468">p. 468</span> <span id="v.xv-Page_468"></span>unto
Horeb the mount of God;” <span id="fr_3754"></span>[3755](#fn_3754.md) and
entered into a cave and rested there; and afterwards was sent to anoint
kings. He was then inured to patience by dwelling in solitude, and, as
though fed to the fatness of virtue by the homely food, went on more
strong.

<span id="v.xv-p187"></span>76. John, too, grew up in the desert, and
baptized the Lord, and there first practised constancy, that afterwards
he might rebuke kings.

<span id="v.xv-p188"></span>77. And since in speaking of holy Elijah’s
dwelling in the desert, we have passed by without notice the names of
places which were not given without a purpose, it seems well to go back
to what they signify. Elijah was sent to the brook Cherith, and there
the ravens nourished him, bringing him bread in the morning, for it
“strengthens man’s heart.” <span id="fr_3755"></span>[3756](#fn_3755.md)
For how should the prophet be nourished except by mystical food? At
evening flesh was supplied. Understand what you read, for Cherith means
“understanding,” Horeb signifies “heart” or “as a heart,” Beersheba also
is interpreted “the well of the seventh,” or “of the oath.”

<span id="v.xv-p190"></span>78. Elijah went first to Beersheba, to the
mysteries and sacraments of the divine and holy Law, next he is sent to
the brook, to the stream of the river which makes glad the City of
God. <span id="fr_3756"></span>[3757](#fn_3756.md) You perceive the two
Testaments of the One Author; the old Scripture as a well deep and
obscure, whence you can only draw with labour; it is not full, for He
Who was to fill it was not yet come, Who afterwards said: “I am come not
to destroy but to fulfil the Law.” <span
id="fr_3757"></span>[3758](#fn_3757.md) And so the Saint is bidden of the
Lord to pass over to the stream, for he who has drunk of the New
Testament, not only is a river, but also “from his belly shall flow
rivers of living water,” <span id="fr_3758"></span>[3759](#fn_3758.md)
rivers of understanding, rivers of meditation, spiritual rivers, which,
however, dried up in the times of unbelief, lest the sacrilegious and
unbelieving should drink.

<span id="v.xv-p194"></span>79. At that place the ravens recognized the
Prophet of the Lord, whom the Jews did not recognize. The ravens fed
him, whom that royal and noble race were persecuting. What is Jezebel,
who persecuted him but the Synagogue, vainly fluent, vainly abounding in
the Scriptures, which it neither keeps nor understands? What ravens fed
him but those whose young call upon Him, to whose cattle He gives food
as we read; “to the young ravens that call upon Him.” <span
id="fr_3759"></span>[3760](#fn_3759.md) Those ravens knew whom they were
feeding, who were close upon understanding, and brought food to that
stream of sacred knowledge.

<span id="v.xv-p196"></span>80. He feeds the prophet, who understands
and keeps the things that are written. Our faith gives him sustenance,
our progress gives him nourishment; he feeds upon our minds and senses,
his discourse is nourished by our understanding. In the morning we give
him bread, who, being placed in the light of the Gospel, bestow on him
the settled strength of our hearts. By these things he is nourished, by
these he is strong, with these he fills the mouths of those who fast, to
whom the unbelief of the Jews supplied no food of faith. To them every
prophetic utterance is but fasting diet, the interior richness of which
they do not see; empty and thin, such as cannot fatten their jaws.

<span id="v.xv-p197"></span>81. Perhaps they brought him flesh in the
evening, as it were stronger food, such as the Corinthians, whose minds
were weak, could not take, and were therefore fed by the Apostle with
milk. <span id="fr_3760"></span>[3761](#fn_3760.md) So, stronger meat was
brought in the evening of the world, in the morning bread. And so,
because the Lord commanded this food to be supplied, that word of
prophecy may be suitably addressed to Him in this place: “Thou wilt give
joy in the outgoings of morning and evening;” <span
id="fr_3761"></span>[3762](#fn_3761.md) and, farther on: “Thou hast
prepared their food, for so is its preparation.” <span
id="fr_3762"></span>[3763](#fn_3762.md)

<span id="v.xv-p201"></span>82. But I think that enough has been said of
the Master, let us now go on to the lives of the disciples, who have
given themselves to His praise and celebrate it with hymns day and
night. For this is the service of the Angels, to be always occupied in
the praises of God, to propitiate and entreat the Lord with frequent
prayers. They attend to reading, or occupy their minds with continual
labours, and separated from the companionship of women, afford safe
protection to each other. What a life is this, in which is nothing to
fear, much to imitate! The pain of fasting is compensated by
tranquillity of mind, is lightened by practice, aided by leisure, or
beguiled by occupation; is not burdened with worldly cares, nor occupied
with uncongenial troubles, nor weighed down with the distractions of the
city.

<span id="v.xv-p202"></span>83. You perceive what kind of teacher must
be found for the preservation or teaching of this gift, and we can find
him, if you assist by unanimity, if you forgive one <span
id="page_469">p. 469</span> <span id="v.xv-Page_469"></span>another
should any one think himself injured by another. For it is not the only
kind of justice, not to injure him who has not injured us, but also to
forgive him who has most injured us. We are often injured by the fraud
of another, by the guile of a neighbour; do we consider it a mark of
virtue, to avenge guile by guile, or to repay fraud by fraud? For if
justice is a virtue it should be free from offence, and should not repel
wickedness by wickedness. For what virtue is it that the same thing
should be done by you which you yourself punish in another? That is the
spreading of wickedness not its punishment, for it makes no difference
whom one injures, whether a just man or an unjust, seeing one ought not
to injure anyone. Nor does it make any difference in what way one bears
ill will, whether from a desire of revenging oneself, or from a wish to
injure, since in neither case is ill will free from blame. For to bear
ill will is the same thing as to be unjust, and so it is said to thee:
“Bear not ill will amongst those that bear ill will, and emulate not
those that do unrighteousness;” <span
id="fr_3763"></span>[3764](#fn_3763.md) and above; “I have hated the
congregation of them that bear ill will.” <span
id="fr_3764"></span>[3765](#fn_3764.md) He clearly comprehends all and
makes no exception, he lays hold of ill will and asks not the cause.

<span id="v.xv-p205"></span>84. But what better pattern can there be
than that of Divine justice? For the Son of God says: “Love your
enemies;” <span id="fr_3765"></span>[3766](#fn_3765.md) and again: “Pray
for those that persecute you and speak against you.” <span
id="fr_3766"></span>[3767](#fn_3766.md) So far does He remove the desire of
vengeance from the perfect that He commands charity towards those who
injure them. And since He had said in the Old Testament: “Vengeance is
Mine, I will repay.” <span id="fr_3767"></span>[3768](#fn_3767.md) He says
in the Gospel, that we are to pray for those who have injured us, that
He Who has said that He will avenge, may not do so; for it is His will
to pardon at your desire with which according to His promise He agrees.
But if you seek for you know that the unjust is more severely punished
by his own convictions than by judicial severity.

<span id="v.xv-p209"></span>85. And since no one can be without some
adversities, let us take care that they do not happen to us through our
own fault. For no one is more severely condemned by the judgment of
others, than a foolish man, who is the cause of his misfortunes, is
condemned by his own. For which reason we should decline matters which
are full of trouble and contention, which have no advantage, but cause
hindrances. Although we ought to take care not to have to repent our
decisions or acts. For it is the part of a prudent man to look forward,
so as not often to have to repent, for never to repent belongs to God
alone. But what is the fruit of righteousness, but tranquillity of mind?
Or what is to live righteously but to live with tranquility? Such as is
the pattern of the master, such is the condition of the whole house. But
if these things are requisite in a house, how much more in the Church,
“where we, both rich and poor, bond and free, Greek and Scythian, noble
and common, are all one in Christ Jesus.” <span
id="fr_3768"></span>[3769](#fn_3768.md)

<span id="v.xv-p211"></span>86. Let no man suppose that because he is
rich, more deference is to be paid him. In the Church he is rich who is
rich in faith, for the faithful has a whole world of riches. What wonder
is it if the faithful possesses the world, who possesses the inheritance
of Christ, which is of more value than the world? “Ye were redeemed with
the Precious Blood,” <span id="fr_3769"></span>[3770](#fn_3769.md) was
certainly said to all, not to the rich only. But if you will be rich,
obey him who says: “Be ye holy in all your conversation.” <span
id="fr_3770"></span>[3771](#fn_3770.md) He is speaking not to the rich only
but to all; for He judges without respect of persons, as the Apostle His
faithful witness says. And therefore says he: “Spend the time of your
sojourning here,” <span id="fr_3771"></span>[3772](#fn_3771.md) not in
luxury, or fastidiousness, nor haughtiness of heart, but in fear. On
this earth you have time not eternity, do you use the time as those who
must pass hence.

<span id="v.xv-p215"></span>87. Do not trust in riches; for all such
things are left here, faith alone will accompany you. And righteousness
indeed will go with you if faith has led the way. Why do riches entice
you? “Ye were not redeemed with gold and silver,” with possessions, or
silk garments, “from your vain conversation, but with the precious Blood
of Christ.” <span id="fr_3772"></span>[3773](#fn_3772.md) He then is rich
who is an heir of God, a joint heir with Christ. Despise not the poor
man, he has made you rich. “This poor man cried, and the Lord heard
him.” <span id="fr_3773"></span>[3774](#fn_3773.md) Do not reject a poor
man, Christ when He was rich became poor, and became poor because of
you, that by His poverty He might make you rich. <span
id="fr_3774"></span>[3775](#fn_3774.md) Do not then as though rich exalt
yourself, He sent forth His apostles without money.

<span id="v.xv-p219"></span>88. And the first of them said: “Silver and
gold have I none.” <span id="fr_3775"></span>[3776](#fn_3775.md) He glories
in <span id="page_470">p. 470</span> <span
id="v.xv-Page_470"></span>poverty as though shunning contamination.
“Silver and gold,” he says, “I have none,”—not gold and silver. He knows
not their order in value who knows not the use of them. “Silver and gold
have I none,” but I have faith. I am rich enough in the Name of Jesus,
“which is above every name.” <span id="fr_3776"></span>[3777](#fn_3776.md)
I have no silver, neither do I require any; I have no gold, neither do I
desire it, but I have what you rich men have not, I have what even you
would consider to be of more value, and I give it to the poor, namely
that I say in the Name of Jesus: “Be strengthened, ye weak hands, and ye
feeble knees.” <span id="fr_3777"></span>[3778](#fn_3777.md)

<span id="v.xv-p223"></span>89. But if you will be rich, you must be
poor. Then shall you in all things be rich, if you are poor in spirit.
It is not property which makes rich, but the spirit.

<span id="v.xv-p224"></span>90. There are those who humble themselves in
abundance of riches, and they act rightly and prudently, for the law of
nature is sufficiently rich for all, according to which one may soon
find what is more than enough; but for lust any abundance of riches is
still penury. Again, no one is born poor but becomes so. Poverty then is
not in nature but in our own feelings, and so to find oneself rich is
easy for nature, but hard for lust. For the more a man has gained the
more he thirsts for gain, and burns as it were with a kind of
intoxication from his lusts.

<span id="v.xv-p225"></span>91. Why do you seek for a heap of riches as
though it were necessary? Nothing is so necessary as to know that this
is not necessary. Why do you throw the blame on the flesh? It is not the
belly in the body but avarice in the mind which makes a man insatiable.
Does the flesh take away the hope of the future? Does the flesh destroy
the sweetness of spiritual grace? Does the flesh hinder faith? Is it the
flesh which attributes any weight to vain opinions as it were to insane
masters? The flesh prefers frugal moderation, by which it is freed from
burdens, is clothed with health, because it has laid aside its care and
has obtained tranquillity.

<span id="v.xv-p226"></span>92. But riches themselves are not blameable.
For “the ransom of a man’s life are his riches,” <span
id="fr_3778"></span>[3779](#fn_3778.md) since he that gives to the poor
redeems his soul. <span id="fr_3779"></span>[3780](#fn_3779.md) So that
even in these material riches there is place for virtue. You are like
steersmen in the vast sea. If a man steers his course well, he quickly
passes over the sea so as to attain to the port, but one who knows not
how to direct his property is drowned together with his freight. And so
it is written: “The wealth of rich men is a most strong city.” <span
id="fr_3780"></span>[3781](#fn_3780.md)

<span id="v.xv-p230"></span>93. And what is that city but Jerusalem
which is in heaven, in which is the kingdom of God? This is a good
possession which brings eternal fruit. A good possession which is not
left here, but is possessed there. He who possesses this says: “The Lord
is my portion.” <span id="fr_3781"></span>[3782](#fn_3781.md) He says not,
My portion stretches and extends from this boundary to that. Nor does he
say, My portion is amongst such and such neighbours, except perchance
amongst the apostles, amongst the prophets, amongst the saints of the
Lord, for this is the righteous man’s portion. He does not say, My
portion is in the meadows, or in the woods, or the plains, except
perchance those wooded plains in which the Church is found, of which it
is written: “We found it in the wooded plains.” <span
id="fr_3782"></span>[3783](#fn_3782.md) He does not say, My portion
consists of herds of horses, for “a horse is a vain thing for
safety.” <span id="fr_3783"></span>[3784](#fn_3783.md) He does not say, My
portion consists of herds of oxen, asses, or sheep; except perchance he
reckons himself amongst those which know their Owner, and wishes to
company with the ass which does not shun the crib <span
id="fr_3784"></span>[3785](#fn_3784.md) of Christ; and that Sheep is his
portion which was led to the slaughter, and that Lamb which was dumb
before the shearer, and opened not His mouth, <span
id="fr_3785"></span>[3786](#fn_3785.md) in Whose humiliation judgment has
been exalted. Well does he say “before the shearer,” for He laid aside
what was additional, not His own essence, on the cross, when He laid
aside His Body, but lost not His Divinity.

<span id="v.xv-p236"></span>94. It is not then everyone who can say,
“The Lord is my portion.” The covetous man cannot, for covetousness
draws near and says: Thou art my portion, I have thee in subjection,
thou hast served me, thou hast sold thyself to me with that gold, by
that possession thou hast adjudged thyself to me. The luxurious man says
not: Christ is my portion, for luxury comes and says: Thou art my
portion, I made thee mine in that banquet, I caught thee in the net of
that feast, I hold thee by the bond of thy gluttony. Dost thou not know
that thy table was more valued by thee than thy life? I refute thee by
thine own judgment, deny if thou canst, but thou canst not. And in fine
thou hast reserved nothing for thy life, thou hast spent it all for thy
table. The adulterer cannot say: “The Lord is my portion;” for lust
comes and says: I am <span id="page_471">p. 471</span> <span
id="v.xv-Page_471"></span>thy portion, thou didst bind thyself to me in
the love of that maiden, by a night with that harlot thou hast come
under my laws and into my power. The traitor cannot say: “Christ is my
portion,” for at once the wickedness of his sin rushes on him and says:
He is deceiving Thee, Lord Jesus, he is mine.

<span id="v.xv-p237"></span>95. We have an example of this, for when
Judas had received the bread from Christ the devil entered into his
heart, as though claiming his own property, as though retaining his
right to his own portion, as though saying: He is not Thine but mine;
clearly he is my servant, Thy betrayer, plainly he is mine. He sits at
table with Thee, and serves me; with Thee he feasts, but is fed by me;
from Thee he receives bread, from me money; with Thee he drinks, and has
sold Thy Blood to me. And he proved how truly he spoke. Then Christ
departed from him, Judas also himself left Jesus and followed the devil.

<span id="v.xv-p238"></span>96. How many masters has he who has forsaken
the One! But let us not forsake Him. Who would forsake Him Whom they
follow bound with chains indeed, but chains of love, which set free and
do not bind, those chains in which they who are bound boast, saying:
“Paul the bondservant of Jesus Christ, and Timothy.” <span
id="fr_3786"></span>[3787](#fn_3786.md) It is more glorious for us to be
bound by Him, than to be set free and loosed from others. Who then would
flee from peace? Who would flee from salvation? Who would flee from
mercy? Who would flee from redemption?

<span id="v.xv-p240"></span>97. You see, my sons, what has been the end
of those who followed these things, how being dead they yet work. Let us
study to gain the diligence of those the glory of whose virtues we
admire, and what we praise in others, let us silently recognize in
ourselves. Nothing effeminate, nothing feeble attains to praise. “The
kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by
force.” <span id="fr_3787"></span>[3788](#fn_3787.md) The fathers ate the
lamb in haste. Faith hastens, devotion is quick, hope is active, it
loves not objections of the mind, but to pass from fruitless ease to the
fruits of toil. Why do you put off till tomorrow? You can gain to-day;
and must guard against not attaining the one and losing the other. The
loss even of one hour is no slight one, one hour is a portion of our
whole life.

<span id="v.xv-p242"></span>98. There are young persons who desire
quickly to attain to old age, so as no longer to be subject to the will
of their elders; and there are also old men who would wish if they could
to return again to youth. And I approve of neither desire, for the
young, disdainful of things present, as it were ungratefully desire a
change in their way of living, the old wish for its lengthening, whereas
youth can grow old in character, and old age grow green with action. For
it is discipline as much as age which brings amendment of character. How
much the more then ought we to raise our hopes to the kingdom of God,
where will be newness of life, and where will be a change of grace not
of age!

<span id="v.xv-p243"></span>99. Reward is not obtained by ease or by
sleep. The sleeper does no work, ease brings no profit, but rather loss.
Esau by taking his ease lost the blessing of the first-born, for he
preferred to have food given to him rather than to seek it. Industrious
Jacob found favour with each parent.

<span id="v.xv-p244"></span>100. And yet although Jacob was superior in
virtue and favour, he yielded to his brother’s anger, who grieved that
his younger brother was preferred to him. And so it is written: “Give
place to wrath,” <span id="fr_3788"></span>[3789](#fn_3788.md) lest the
wrath of another draw you also into sin, when you wish to resist, and to
avenge yourself. You can put away sin both from him and from yourself,
if you think well to yield. Imitate the patriarch who by his mother’s
counsel went far away. And who was the mother? Rebecca, that is,
Patience. For who but Patience could have given this counsel? The mother
loved her son, but preferred that he should be cut off from herself
rather than from God. And so because the mother was good, she benefited
both her sons, but to the youngest she gave a blessing which he could
keep; yet she preferred not one son to the other as sons; but the active
to the easy-going, the faithful to the unbelieving.

<span id="v.xv-p246"></span>101. And so since he was separated from his
parents through piety not on account of impiety, he talked with God, he
increased in riches, in children, and in favour. Nor was he elated by
these things when he met his brother; but humbly bowed down to him, not
indeed considering him the pitiless, the furious, the degenerate, but
Him Whom he reverenced in him. And so he bowed down seven times, which
is the number of remission, for he was not bowing down to man, but to
Him Whom he foresaw in the Spirit, as hereafter to come in human flesh
to take away the sins of the world. <span
id="fr_3789"></span>[3790](#fn_3789.md) And this mystery is unfolded to you
in the answer <span id="page_472">p. 472</span> <span
id="v.xv-Page_472"></span>given to Peter, when he said: “If my brother
trespass against me how often shall I forgive him? Until seven
times?” <span id="fr_3790"></span>[3791](#fn_3790.md) You see that
remission of sins is a type of that great Sabbath, of that rest of
everlasting grace, and therefore is given by contemplation.

<span id="v.xv-p249"></span>102. But what is the meaning of his having
arranged his wives and children and all his servants, and ordered that
they should bow down to the earth? It was certainly not to the element
of earth, which is often filled with blood, in which is the workshop of
all crimes, which often is rough with huge rocks, or broken cliffs, or
barren and hungry soil, but as to that Flesh which is to be for our
salvation. And perchance this is that mystery which the Lord taught,
when He said: “Not only seven times, but even seventy times
seven.” <span id="fr_3791"></span>[3792](#fn_3791.md)

<span id="v.xv-p251"></span>103. Do you then forgive injuries done to
you that you may be children of Jacob. Be not provoked as was Esau.
Imitate holy David, who as a good master left us what we should follow,
saying: “Instead of loving me they spake against me, but I
prayed,” <span id="fr_3792"></span>[3793](#fn_3792.md) and when he was
reviled, he prayed. Prayer is a good shield, wherewith contumely is kept
away, cursing is repelled and often is turned back on those who utter
it, so that they are wounded by their own weapons. “Let them curse,” he
says, “but bless Thou.” <span id="fr_3793"></span>[3794](#fn_3793.md) The
curse of man is to be sought for, which procures the blessing of the
Lord.

<span id="v.xv-p254"></span>104. And for the rest, most dear brethren,
consider that Jesus suffered without the gate, and do you go forth out
of this earthly city, for your city is Jerusalem which is above. Let
your conversation be there, that you may say: “But our conversation is
in heaven.” <span id="fr_3794"></span>[3795](#fn_3794.md) Therefore did
Jesus go forth out of the city, that you going out of this world may be
above the world. Moses alone, who saw God, had his tabernacle without
the camp when he talked with God; <span
id="fr_3795"></span>[3796](#fn_3795.md) and the blood indeed of the victims
which were offered for sin, was brought to the altar, but the bodies
were burnt without the camp; <span id="fr_3796"></span>[3797](#fn_3796.md)
for no one placed amidst the evil of this world can lay aside sin, nor
is his blood accepted of God, except he go forth from the defilement of
this body.

<span id="v.xv-p258"></span>105. Love hospitality, whereby holy Abraham
found favour, and received Christ as his guest, and Sarah already worn
with age gained a son; Lot also escaped the fire of the destruction of
Sodom. You too can receive Angels if you offer hospitality to strangers.
What shall I say of Rahab who by this means found safety?

<span id="v.xv-p259"></span>106. Compassionate those who are bound with
chains, as though bound with them. Comfort those in sorrow; for, “It is
better to go into the house of mourning than into the house of
rejoicing.” <span id="fr_3797"></span>[3798](#fn_3797.md) From the one is
gained the merit of a good work, from the other a lapse into sin.
Lastly, in the one case you still hope for the reward, in the other you
have already received it. Feel with those who are afflicted as if also
afflicted with them.

<span id="v.xv-p261"></span>107. Let a wife show deference, not be a
slave to her husband; let her show herself ready to be ruled not
coerced. She is not worthy of wedlock who deserves chiding. Let a
husband also guide his wife like a steersman, honour her as the partner
of his life, share with her as a joint heir of grace.

<span id="v.xv-p262"></span>108. Mothers, wean your children, love them,
but pray for them that they may long live above this earth, not on the
earth but above it, for there is nothing long-lived on this earth, and
that which lasts long is but short and very frail. Warn them rather to
take up the Cross of the Lord than to love this life.

<span id="v.xv-p263"></span>109. Mary, the mother of the Lord stood by
her Son’s Cross; no one has taught me this but the holy Evangelist St.
John. <span id="fr_3798"></span>[3799](#fn_3798.md) Others have related how
the earth was shaken at the Lord’s passion, the sky was covered with
darkness, the sun withdrew itself; <span
id="fr_3799"></span>[3800](#fn_3799.md) that the thief was after a faithful
confession received into paradise. <span
id="fr_3800"></span>[3801](#fn_3800.md) John tells us what the others have
not told, how the Lord fixed on the Cross called to His mother,
esteeming it of more worth that, victorious over His sufferings, He
rendered her the offices of piety, than that He gave her a heavenly
kingdom. For if it be according to religion to grant pardon to the
thief, it is a mark of much greater piety that a mother is honoured with
such affection by her Son. “Behold,” He says, “thy Son”.…“Behold thy
mother.” <span id="fr_3801"></span>[3802](#fn_3801.md) Christ testified
from the Cross, and divided the offices of piety between the mother and
the disciple. The Lord made not only a public but also a private
testament, and John signed this testament of His, a witness worthy of so
great a Testator. A good testament not of money but of eternal life,
which was written not with ink but with <span id="page_473">p.
473</span> <span id="v.xv-Page_473"></span>the Spirit of the living God,
Who says: “My tongue is the pen of a quickly writing scribe.” <span
id="fr_3802"></span>[3803](#fn_3802.md)

<span id="v.xv-p269"></span>110. Nor was Mary below what was becoming
the mother of Christ. When the apostles fled, she stood at the Cross,
and with pious eyes beheld her Son’s wounds, for she did not look for
the death of her Offspring, but the salvation of the world. Or
perchance, because that “royal hall” <span
id="fr_3803"></span>[3804](#fn_3803.md) knew that the redemption of the
world would be through the death of her Son, she thought that by her
death also she might add something to the public weal. But Jesus did not
need a helper for the redemption of all, Who saved all without a helper.
Wherefore also He says: “I am become like a man without help, free among
the dead.” <span id="fr_3804"></span>[3805](#fn_3804.md) He received indeed
the affection of His mother, but sought not another’s help.

<span id="v.xv-p272"></span>111. Imitate her, holy mothers, who in her
only dearly beloved Son set forth so great an example of maternal
virtue; for neither have you sweeter children, nor did the Virgin seek
the consolation of being able to bear another son.

<span id="v.xv-p273"></span>112. Masters, command your servants not as
being below you in rank, but as remembering that they are sharers of the
same nature as yourselves. <span id="fr_3805"></span>[3806](#fn_3805.md)
Servants, serve your masters with good will, for each ought patiently to
support that to which he is born, and be obedient not only to good but
also to froward masters. For what thanks has your service if you
zealously serve good masters? But if you thus serve the froward also you
gain merit; for the free also have no reward, if when they transgress
they are punished by the judges, but this is their merit to suffer
without transgressing. And so you, if contemplating the Lord Jesus you
serve even difficult masters with patience, will have your reward. Since
the Lord Himself suffered, the just at the hand of the unjust, and by
His wonderful patience nailed our sins to His Cross, that he who shall
imitate Him may wash away his sins in His Blood.

<span id="v.xv-p275"></span>113. In fine, turn all to the Lord Jesus.
Let your enjoyment of this life be with a good conscience, your
endurance of death with the hope of immortality, your assurance of the
resurrection through the grace of Christ; let truth be with simplicity,
faith with confidence, abstinence with holiness, industry with
soberness, conversation with modesty, learning without vanity; let there
be soberness of doctrine, faith without the intoxication of heresy. The
grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.

of the Nicene tractate or creed,” possibly. The reference is plain,
though there are various readings, and *tractatus* may not mean the
creed. The real difficulty is that in the 20 extant Canons of Nicæa,
there is no reference of the kind, and there is no evidence that any are
missing. Perhaps St. Ambrose is quoting from memory, or some faulty
collection, and so other canons are wrongly spoken of as Nicene. On the
subject comp. St. Ambr. *de Off.* I. 257, and *Dict. Chr. Ant.* art.
“Digamy.”

the Blessed Virgin is also used by St. Ambrose, *de Inst. Virg.* XII.
79, and in the Hymn for the Nativity of our Lord—“*Veni Redemptor
gentium,*” verse 4—“*Procedit e thalamo Suo, Pudoris aula Regia.*” The
force is lost in the translation adopted in *Hymns Ancient and Modern,*
No. 57, but is preserved in Dr. Neale’s version, “Proceeding from His
chamber free, The royal hall of chastity.”—*Hymnal Noted,* No. 31.
