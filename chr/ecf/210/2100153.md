<span id="iv.ii.iv.i"></span>

#### <span id="iv.ii.iv.i-p0.1"></span>Chapter I.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.i-p1"></span>Not only were the prophets and apostles
sent by the Spirit, but also the Son of God. This is proved from Isaiah
and the evangelists, and it is explained why St. Luke wrote that the
same Spirit descended like a dove upon Christ and abode upon Him. Next,
after establishing this mission of Christ, the writer infers that the
Son is sent by the Father and the Spirit, as the Spirit is by the Father
and the Son.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.i-p2"></span>1. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.ii.iv.i-p2.1"></span>In</span> the former book <span
id="fr_1228"></span>[1229](#fn_1228) we have shown by the clear evidence
of the Scriptures that the apostles and prophets were appointed, the
latter to prophesy, the former to preach the Gospel, by the Holy Spirit
in the same way as by the Father and the Son; now we add what all will
rightly wonder at, and not be able to doubt, that the Spirit was upon
Christ; and that as He sent the Spirit, so the Spirit sent the Son of
God. For the Son of God says: “The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me,
because He hath anointed Me, He hath sent Me to preach the Gospel to the
poor, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and sight to the
blind.” <span id="fr_1229"></span>[1230](#fn_1229) And having read this
from the Book of Isaiah, He says in the Gospel: “To-day hath this
Scripture been fulfilled in your ears;” <span
id="fr_1230"></span>[1231](#fn_1230) that He might point out that it was
said of Himself.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.i-p6"></span>2. Can we, then, wonder if the Spirit
sent both the prophets and the apostles, since Christ said: “The Spirit
of the Lord is upon Me”? And rightly did He say “upon Me,” because He
was speaking as the Son of Man. For as the Son of Man He <span
id="page_136">p. 136</span> <span id="iv.ii.iv.i-Page_136"></span>was
anointed and sent to preach the Gospel.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.i-p7"></span>3. But if they believe not the Son, let
them hear the Father also saying that the Spirit of the Lord is upon
Christ. For He says to John: “Upon whomsoever thou shalt see the Spirit
descending from heaven and abiding upon Him, He it is Who baptizeth with
the Holy Spirit.” <span id="fr_1231"></span>[1232](#fn_1231) God the
Father said this to John, and John heard and saw and believed. He heard
from God, he saw in the Lord, he believed that it was the Spirit Who was
coming down from heaven. For it was not a dove that descended, but the
Holy Spirit as a dove; for thus it is written: “I saw the Spirit
descending from heaven as a dove.” <span
id="fr_1232"></span>[1233](#fn_1232)

<span id="iv.ii.iv.i-p10"></span>4. As John says that he saw, so, too,
wrote Mark; Luke, however, added that the Holy Spirit descended in a
bodily form as a dove; you must not think that this was an incarnation,
but an appearance. He, then, brought the appearance before him, that by
means of the appearance he might believe who did not see the Spirit, and
that by the appearance He might manifest that He had a share of the one
honour in authority, the one operation in the mystery, the one gift in
the bath, together with the Father and the Son; unless perchance we
consider Him in Whom the Lord was baptized too weak for the servant to
be baptized in Him.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.i-p11"></span>5. And he said fittingly, “abiding upon
Him,” <span id="fr_1233"></span>[1234](#fn_1233) because the Spirit
inspired a saying or acted upon the prophets as often as He would, but
abode always in Christ.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.i-p13"></span>6. Nor, again, let it move you that he
said “upon Him,” for he was speaking of the Son of Man, because he was
baptized as the Son of Man. For the Spirit is not upon Christ, according
to the Godhead, but in Christ; for, as the Father is in the Son, and the
Son in the Father, so the Spirit of God and the Spirit of Christ is both
in the Father and in the Son, for He is the Spirit of His mouth. For He
Who is of God abides in God, as it is written: “But we received not the
spirit of this world, but the Spirit which is of God.” <span
id="fr_1234"></span>[1235](#fn_1234) And He abides in Christ, Who has
received from Christ; for it is written again: “He shall take of
Mine:” <span id="fr_1235"></span>[1236](#fn_1235) and elsewhere: “The
law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus made me free from the law of
sin and death.” <span id="fr_1236"></span>[1237](#fn_1236) He is, then,
not over Christ according to the Godhead of Christ, for the Trinity is
not over Itself, but over all things: It is not over Itself but in
Itself.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.i-p17"></span>7. Who, then, can doubt that the Spirit
sent the prophets and apostles, since the Son of God says: “The Spirit
of the Lord is upon Me.” <span id="fr_1237"></span>[1238](#fn_1237) And
elsewhere: “I am the First, and I am also for ever, and Mine hand hath
founded the earth, and My right hand hath established the heaven; I will
call them and they shall stand up together, and shall all be gathered
together and shall hear. Who hath declared these things to them? Because
I loved thee I performed thy pleasure against Babylon, that the seed of
the Chaldæans might be taken away. I have spoken, and I have called, I
have brought him and have made his way prosperous. Come unto Me and hear
ye this. From the beginning I have not spoken in secret, I was there
when those things were done; and now the Lord God hath sent Me and His
Spirit.” <span id="fr_1238"></span>[1239](#fn_1238) Who is it Who says:
The Lord God hath sent Me and His Spirit, except He Who came from the
Father that He might save sinners? And, as you hear, the Spirit sent
Him, lest when you hear that the Son sends the Spirit, you should
believe the Spirit to be of inferior power.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.i-p20"></span>8. So both the Father and the Spirit
sent the Son; the Father sent Him, for it is written: “But the
Paraclete, the Holy Spirit, Whom the Father will send in My Name.” <span
id="fr_1239"></span>[1240](#fn_1239) The Son sent Him, for He said: “But
when the Paraclete is come, Whom I will send unto you from the Father,
even the Spirit of Truth.” <span id="fr_1240"></span>[1241](#fn_1240)
If, then, the Son and the Spirit send each other, as the Father sends,
there is no inferiority of subjection, but a community of power.
