#### <span id="iv.vii.ii.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.

<span id="iv.vii.ii.iii-p1"></span>Virginity is praised on many grounds,
but chiefly because it brought down the Word from heaven, and hence its
pursuit, which existed in but few under the old covenant, has spread to
countless numbers.

<span id="iv.vii.ii.iii-p2"></span>10. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vii.ii.iii-p2.1"></span>And</span> now the love of purity draws
me on, and you, my holy sister, even though not speaking in your silent
habit, to say something about virginity, lest that which is a principal
virtue should seem to be passed by with only a slight reference. For
virginity is not praiseworthy because it is found in martyrs, but
because itself makes martyrs.

<span id="iv.vii.ii.iii-p3"></span>11. But who can comprehend that by
human understanding which not even nature has included in her laws? Or
who can explain in ordinary language that which is above the course of
nature? Virginity has brought from heaven that which it may imitate on
earth. And not unfittingly has she sought her manner of life from
heaven, who has found for herself a Spouse in heaven. She, passing
beyond the clouds, air, angels, and stars, has found the Word of God in
the very bosom of the Father, and has drawn Him into herself with her
whole heart. For who having found so great a Good would forsake it? For
“Thy Name is as ointment poured out, therefore have the maidens loved
Thee, and drawn Thee.” <span id="fr_3171"></span>[3172](#fn_3171) And
indeed what I have said is not my own, since they who marry not nor are
given in marriage are as the angels in heaven. Let us not, then, be
surprised if they are compared to the angels who are joined to the Lord
of angels. Who, then, can deny that this mode of life has its source in
heaven, which we don’t easily find on earth, except since God came down
into the members of an earthly body? Then a Virgin conceived, and the
Word became flesh that flesh might become God.

<span id="iv.vii.ii.iii-p5"></span>12. But some one will say: “But
Elijah is seen to have had nothing to do with the embraces of bodily
love.” And therefore was he carried by a chariot into heaven, <span
id="fr_3172"></span>[3173](#fn_3172) therefore he appeared glorified
with the Lord, <span id="fr_3173"></span>[3174](#fn_3173) and therefore
he is to come as the forerunner of the Lord’s advent. <span
id="fr_3174"></span>[3175](#fn_3174) And Miriam taking the timbrel led
the dances with maidenly modesty. <span
id="fr_3175"></span>[3176](#fn_3175) But consider whom she was then
representing. Was she not a type of the Church, who as a virgin with
unstained spirit joins together the religious gatherings of the people
to sing divine songs? For we read that there were virgins appointed also
in the temple at Jerusalem. But what says the Apostle? “These things
happened to them in a figure, that they might be signs of what was to
come.” <span id="fr_3176"></span>[3177](#fn_3176) For the figure is
shown in few, the life exists in many.

<span id="iv.vii.ii.iii-p11"></span>13. But in truth after that the
Lord, coming in our flesh, joined together the Godhead and flesh without
any confusion or mixture, then the practice of the life of heaven
spreading throughout the whole world was implanted in human bodies. This
is that which angels ministering on earth signified should come to
pass, <span id="fr_3177"></span>[3178](#fn_3177) which ministry should
be offered to the Lord with the service of an unstained body. This is
that heavenly service which the host of rejoicing angels spoke of for
the earth. <span id="fr_3178"></span>[3179](#fn_3178) We have, then, the
authority of antiquity from of old, the fulness of the setting forth
from Christ Himself.
