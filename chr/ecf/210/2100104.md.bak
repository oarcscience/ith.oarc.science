<span id="iv.i.iv.x"></span>

#### <span id="iv.i.iv.x-p0.1"></span>Chapter X.

<span id="iv.i.iv.x-p1"></span>We are warned not only in civil law, but
also in the holy Scriptures, to avoid fraud in every agreement, as is
clear from the example of Joshua and the Gibeonites.

<span id="iv.i.iv.x-p2"></span>66. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.iv.x-p2.1"></span>In</span> everything, therefore, good faith
is seemly, justice is pleasing, due measure in equity is delightful. But
what shall I say about contracts, and especially about the sale of land,
or agreements, or covenants? Are there not rules just for the purpose of
shutting out all false deceit, <span id="fr_664"></span>[665](#fn_664.md)
and to make him whose deceit is found out liable to double punishment?
Everywhere, then, does regard for what is virtuous take the lead; it
shuts out deceit, it expels fraud. Wherefore the prophet David has
rightly stated his judgment in general, saying: “He hath done no evil to
his neighbour.” <span id="fr_665"></span>[666](#fn_665.md) Fraud, then,
ought to be wanting not only in contracts, in which the defects of those
things which are for sale are ordered to be recorded (which contracts,
unless the vendor has mentioned the defects, are rendered void by an
action for fraud, although he has conveyed them fully to the purchaser),
but it ought also to be absent in all else. Candour must be shown, the
truth must be made known.

<span id="iv.i.iv.x-p5"></span>67. The divine Scriptures have plainly
stated (not indeed a legal rule of the lawyers but) the ancient judgment
of the patriarchs on deceit, in that book of the Old Testament which is
ascribed to Joshua the son of Nun. When the report had gone forth among
the various peoples that the sea was dried up at the crossing of the
Hebrews; that water had flowed from the rock; that food was supplied
daily from heaven in quantities large enough for so many thousands of
the people; that the walls of Jericho had fallen at the sound of the
holy trumpets, being overthrown by the noise of the shouts of the
people; also, that the king of Ai was conquered and had been hung on a
tree until the evening; then the Gibeonites, fearing his strong hand,
came with guile, pretending that they were from a land very far away,
and by travelling so long had rent their shoes and worn out their
clothing, of which they showed proofs that it was growing old. They
said, too, that their reason for undergoing so much labour was their
desire to obtain peace and to form friendship with the Hebrews, and
began to ask Joshua to form an alliance with them. And he, being as yet
ignorant of localities, and not knowing anything of the inhabitants, did
not see through their deceit, nor did he enquire of God, but readily
believed them. <span id="fr_666"></span>[667](#fn_666.md)

<span id="iv.i.iv.x-p7"></span>68. So sacred was one’s plighted word
held in those days that no one would believe that others could try to
deceive. Who could find fault with the saints in this, namely, that they
should consider others to have the same feelings as themselves, and
suppose no one would lie because truth was their own companion? They
know not what deceit is, they gladly believe of others what they
themselves are, whilst they cannot suspect others to be what they
themselves are not. Hence Solomon says: “An innocent man believeth every
word.” <span id="fr_667"></span>[668](#fn_667.md) We must not blame his
readiness to believe, but should rather praise his goodness. To know
nothing of aught that may injure another, this is to be innocent. And
although he is cheated by another, still he thinks well of all, for he
thinks there is good faith in all.

<span id="iv.i.iv.x-p9"></span>69. Induced, therefore, by such
considerations to believe them, he made an agreement, he gave them
peace, and formed a union with them. But when he came to their country
and the deceit was found out,—for though they lived quite close they
pretended to be strangers,—the people of our fathers began to be angry
at having been deceived. Joshua, however, thought the peace they had
made could not be broken (for it had been confirmed by an oath), for
fear that, in punishing the treachery of others, he should be breaking
his own pledge. He made them pay the penalty, however, by forcing them
to undertake the lowest kind of work. The judgment was mild indeed, but
it was a lasting one, for in their duties there abides the punishment of
their ancient cunning, <span id="page_79">p. 79</span> <span
id="iv.i.iv.x-Page_79"></span>handed down to this day <span
id="fr_668"></span>[669](#fn_668.md) in their hereditary service.
