#### <span id="iv.vi.ii.xvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVII.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xvii-p1"></span>That gentleness must be added to
severity, as is shown in the case of St. Paul at Corinth. The man had
been baptized, though the Novatians argue against it. And by the word
“destruction” is not meant annihilation but severe chastening.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xvii-p2"></span>92. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.xvii-p2.1"></span>Why</span> do we postpone the time of
pardon for those who have mortified themselves, who during life have
done themselves to death? “Sufficient,” says St. Paul, “to such a one is
this punishment which is inflicted by the many; so that contrariwise, ye
should rather forgive him and comfort him, lest by any means he should
be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.” <span
id="fr_3042"></span>[3043](#fn_3042.md) If the punishment which is
inflicted by the many is sufficient for condemnation, the intercession
which is made by many is also sufficient for the remission of sin. The
Master of morals, Who both knows our weakness and is the interpreter of
the will of God, wills that comfort should be given, lest sorrow through
the weariness of long delay should swallow up the penitent.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xvii-p4"></span>93. The Apostle then forgave him, and
not only forgave him, but desired that love to him should again grow
strong. He who is loved receives not harshness but mercy. And not only
did he himself forgive him only, but willed that all should forgive him,
and says that he forgave for the sake of others, lest many should be
longer saddened on account of one. “To whom,” says he, “ye have forgiven
anything, I forgive also, for I also have forgiven for your sakes in the
person of Christ, for we are not ignorant of his devices.” <span
id="fr_3043"></span>[3044](#fn_3043.md) Rightly can he be on his guard
against the serpent who is not ignorant of his devices, of which there
are so many to our detriment. He is always desirous to do harm, always
desirous to circumvent us, that he may cause death; but we ought to take
heed lest our remedy become an occasion of triumph for him; for we are
circumvented by him, if any one perish through overmuch sorrow, who
might be set free by pitifulness.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xvii-p6"></span>94. And that we may know that this
person was baptized, he added: “I wrote to you in my epistle to have no
company with fornicators, not altogether with fornicators of this
world.” <span id="fr_3044"></span>[3045](#fn_3044.md) And farther on he
adds: “But now I write unto you not to keep company if any man that is
named a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolator.” <span
id="fr_3045"></span>[3046](#fn_3045.md) Those whom he has joined together
under one penalty, he willed to attain together to forgiveness. “If any
be such,” he says, “with him not to eat.” <span
id="fr_3046"></span>[3047](#fn_3046.md) How severe he is with the
obstinate, how indulgent to those who seek. Against those rises up in
arms the injury done to Christ, whilst the calling upon Christ aids
these.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xvii-p10"></span>95. But lest any one be perplexed
because it is written: “I have delivered such an one unto Satan for the
destruction of the flesh,” <span id="fr_3047"></span>[3048](#fn_3047.md)
and should say: How can he attain forgiveness whose whole flesh has
perished, seeing that it is evident that man was redeemed both in body
and soul, and is saved in both and that neither the soul without the
body, nor yet the body without the soul, since both are united by their
fellowship in the deeds that have been done, can be without fellowship
either in punishment or in reward? Let this suffice for an answer to
him: That “destruction” does not mean the complete annihilation of the
flesh, but its chastening. For as he who is dead to sin lives to God, so
the allurements of the flesh perish, and the flesh dies to its lusts, in
order that it may live again to purity and to other good works.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xvii-p12"></span>96. And what more suitable example
can we take than one from our common mother? For the earth itself, from
which we are all taken, when it is not worked and cultivated, seems to
be desert; and the field dies to the vines or olive-trees with which it
was planted, and yet it does not lose its own nutritive power, which is,
as it were, its life. And then later, when cultivation begins once more,
and the seed is sown for which the land seems suitable, it breaks forth
again more fruitful than before with its products. It is not, then,
anything so strange if our flesh is said to die, and yet is understood
to be subdued rather than annihilated.
