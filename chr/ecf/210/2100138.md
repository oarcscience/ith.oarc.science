#### <span id="iv.ii.iii.i-p0.1"></span>Introduction.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.i-p1"></span>The Three Persons of the Godhead were
not unknown to the judges of old nor to Moses, for the equality of the
Son with the Father, as well as of the Three Persons amongst Themselves,
is laid down both elsewhere and by him. Samson also enjoyed the
assistance of the Holy Spirit, his history is touched upon and shown to
be in some points typical of the Church and her mysteries. When the Holy
Spirit left Samson he fell into various calamities, and St. Ambrose
explains the spiritual significance of his shorn locks.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.i-p2"></span>1. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.ii.iii.i-p2.1"></span>Even</span> in reading the first book of
the ancient history it is made clear both that the sevenfold grace of
the Spirit shone forth in the judges themselves of the Jews, and that
the mysteries of the heavenly sacraments were made known by the Spirit,
of Whose eternity Moses was not ignorant. Then, too, at the very
beginning of the world, and indeed before its beginning, he conjoined
Him with God, Whom he knew to be eternal before the beginning of the
world. For if any one takes good heed he will recognize in the beginning
both the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. For of the Father it is
written: “In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.” <span
id="fr_1005"></span>[1006](#fn_1005.md) Of the Spirit it is said: “The
Spirit was borne upon the waters.” <span
id="fr_1006"></span>[1007](#fn_1006.md) And well in the beginning of
creation is there set forth the figure of baptism whereby the creature
had to be purified. And of the Son we read that He it is Who divided
light from darkness, for there is one God the Father Who speaks, and one
God the Son Who acts.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.i-p5"></span>2. But, again, that you may not think
that there was assumption in the bidding of Him Who spoke, or
inferiority on the part of Him Who carried out the bidding, the Father
acknowledges the Son as equal to Himself in the execution of the work,
saying: “Let Us make man after Our image and likeness.” <span
id="fr_1007"></span>[1008](#fn_1007.md) For the common image and the
working and the likeness can signify nothing but the oneness of the same
Majesty.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.i-p7"></span>3. But that we may more fully recognize
the equality of the Father and the Son, as the Father spoke, the Son
made, so, too, the Father works and the Son speaks. The Father works, as
it is written: “My Father worketh hitherto.” <span
id="fr_1008"></span>[1009](#fn_1008.md) You find it said to the Son: “Say
the word and he shall be healed.” <span
id="fr_1009"></span>[1010](#fn_1009.md) And the Son says to the Father: “I
will that where I am, they too shall be with Me.” <span
id="fr_1010"></span>[1011](#fn_1010.md) The Father did what the Son said.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.i-p11"></span>4. But neither was Abraham ignorant of
the Holy Spirit; he saw Three and worshipped One, for there is one God,
one Lord, and one Spirit. And so there is a oneness of honour, because
there is a oneness of power.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.i-p12"></span>5. And why should I speak of all one
by one? Samson, born by the divine promise, had the Spirit accompanying
him, for we read: “The Lord blessed him, and the Spirit of the Lord
began to be with him in the camp.” <span
id="fr_1011"></span>[1012](#fn_1011.md) And so foreshadowing the future
mystery, he demanded a wife of the aliens, which, as it is written, his
father and mother knew not of, because it was from the Lord. And rightly
was he esteemed stronger than others, because the Spirit of the Lord
guided him, under Whose guidance he alone put to flight the people of
the aliens, and at another time inaccessible to the bite of the lion,
he, unconquerable in his strength, tore him asunder with his hands.
Would that he had been as careful to preserve grace, as strong to
overcome the beast!

<span id="iv.ii.iii.i-p14"></span><span id="page_116">p. 116</span>
<span id="iv.ii.iii.i-Page_116"></span>6. And perhaps this was not only
a prodigy of valour, but also a mystery of wisdom, an utterance of
prophecy. For it does not seem to have been without a purpose that, as
he was going to his marriage, a roaring lion met him, which he tore
asunder with his hands, in whose body, when about to enjoy the
wished-for wedlock, he found a swarm of bees, and took honey from its
mouth, which he gave to his father and mother to eat. The people of the
Gentiles which believed had honey, the people which was before savage is
now the people of Christ.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.i-p15"></span>7. Nor is the riddle without mystery,
which he set forth to his companions: “Out of the eater came forth meat,
and out of the strong came forth sweetness.” <span
id="fr_1012"></span>[1013](#fn_1012.md) And there was a mystery up to the
point of the three days in which its answer was sought in vain, which
could not be made known except by the faith of the Church, on the
seventh day, the time of the Law being completed, after the Passion of
the Lord. For thus you find that the apostles did not understand,
“because Jesus was not yet glorified.” <span
id="fr_1013"></span>[1014](#fn_1013.md)

<span id="iv.ii.iii.i-p18"></span>8. “What,” answer they, “is sweeter
than honey, and what is stronger than a lion?” To which he replied: “If
ye had not farmed with my heifer, you would not have found out my
riddle.” <span id="fr_1014"></span>[1015](#fn_1014.md) O divine mystery! O
manifest sacrament! we have escaped from the slayer, we have overcome
the strong one. The food of life is now there, where before was the
hunger of a miserable death. Dangers are changed into safety, bitterness
into sweetness. Grace came forth from the offence, power from weakness,
and life from death.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.i-p20"></span>9. There are, however, who think on
the other hand that the wedlock could not have been established unless
the lion of the tribe of Judah had been slain; and so in His body, that
is, the Church, bees were found who store up the honey of wisdom,
because after the Passion of the Lord the apostles believed more fully.
This lion, then, Samson as a Jew slew, but in it he found honey, as in
the figure of the heritage which was to be redeemed, that the remnant
might be saved according to the election of grace. <span
id="fr_1015"></span>[1016](#fn_1015.md)

<span id="iv.ii.iii.i-p22"></span>10. “And the Spirit of the Lord,” it
is said, “came upon him, and he went down to Ascalon, and smote thirty
men of them.” <span id="fr_1016"></span>[1017](#fn_1016.md) For he could
not fail to carry off the victory who saw the mysteries. And so in the
garments they receive the reward of wisdom, the badge of intercourse,
who resolve and answer the riddle.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.i-p24"></span>11. Here, again, other mysteries come
up, in that his wife is taken away, and for this foxes set fire to the
sheaves of the aliens. For their own cunning often deceives those who
contend against divine mysteries. Wherefore it is said again in the Song
of Songs: “Take us the little foxes which destroy the vineyards, that
our vineyards may flourish.” <span id="fr_1017"></span>[1018](#fn_1017.md)
He said well “little,” because the larger could not destroy the
vineyards, though to the strong even the devil is weak.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.i-p26"></span>12. So, then, he (to sum up the story
briefly, for the consideration of the whole passage is reserved for its
own season) was unconquered so long as he kept the grace of the Spirit,
as was the people of God chosen by the Lord, that Nazarite under the
Law. Samson, then, was unconquered, and so invincible as to be able to
smite a thousand men with the jawbone of an ass; <span
id="fr_1018"></span>[1019](#fn_1018.md) so full of heavenly grace that when
thirsty he found even water in the jawbone of an ass, whether you
consider this as a miracle, or turn it to a mystery, because in the
humility of the people of the Gentiles there would be both rest and
triumph according to that which is written: “He that smiteth thee on the
cheek, turn to him also the other.” <span
id="fr_1019"></span>[1020](#fn_1019.md) For by this endurance of injuries,
which the sacrament of baptism teaches, we triumph over the stings of
anger, that having passed through death we may attain to the rest of the
resurrection.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.i-p29"></span>13. Is that, then, Samson who broke
ropes twisted with thongs, and new cords like weak threads? Is that
Samson who did not feel the bonds of his hair fastened to the beam, so
long as he had the grace of the Spirit? He, I say, after the Spirit of
God departed from him, was greatly changed from that Samson Who returned
clothed in the spoils of the aliens, but fallen from his greatness on
the knees of a woman, caressed and deceived, is shorn of his hair. <span
id="fr_1020"></span>[1021](#fn_1020.md)

<span id="iv.ii.iii.i-p31"></span>14. Was, then, the hair of his head of
such importance that, so long as it remained, his strength should endure
unconquered, but when his head was shorn the man should suddenly lose
all his strength? It is not so, nor may we think that the hair of his
head has such power. There is the hair of religion and faith; the hair
of the Nazarite <span id="page_117">p. 117</span> <span
id="iv.ii.iii.i-Page_117"></span>perfect in the Law, consecrated in
sparingness and abstinence, with which she (a type of the Church), who
poured ointment on the feet of the Lord, wiped the feet of the heavenly
Word, for then she knew Christ also after the flesh. That hair it is of
which it is said: “Thy hair is as flocks of goats,” <span
id="fr_1021"></span>[1022](#fn_1021.md) growing on that head of which it is
said: “The head of the man is Christ,” <span
id="fr_1022"></span>[1023](#fn_1022.md) and in another place: “His head is
as fine gold, and his locks like black pine-trees.” <span
id="fr_1023"></span>[1024](#fn_1023.md)

<span id="iv.ii.iii.i-p35"></span>15. And so, also, in the Gospel our
Lord, pointing out that some hairs are seen and known, says: “But even
the hairs of your head are all numbered,” <span
id="fr_1024"></span>[1025](#fn_1024.md) implying, indeed, acts of spiritual
virtues, for God does not take care for our hair. Though, indeed, it is
not absurd to believe that literally, seeing that according to His
divine Majesty nothing can be hidden from Him.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.i-p37"></span>16. But what does it profit me, if God
Himself knows all my hairs? That rather abounds and profits me, if the
watchful witness of good works reward me with the gift of eternal life.
And, in fine, Samson himself, declaring that these hairs are not
mystical, says: “If I be shorn my strength will depart from me.” <span
id="fr_1025"></span>[1026](#fn_1025.md) So much concerning the mystery, let
us now consider the order of the passage.
