<span id="iv.iv.iii.vii"></span>

#### <span id="iv.iv.iii.vii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.vii-p1"></span>By way of leading up to his proof
that Christ is not different from the Father, St. Ambrose cites the more
famous leaders of the Arian party, and explains how little their witness
agrees, and shows what defence the Scriptures provide against them.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.vii-p2"></span>43. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.iii.vii-p2.1"></span>The</span> Arians, then, say that Christ
is unlike the Father; we deny it. Nay, indeed, we shrink in dread from
the word. Nevertheless I would not that your sacred Majesty should trust
to argument and our disputation. Let us enquire of the Scriptures, of
apostles, of prophets, of Christ. In a word, let us enquire of the
Father, Whose honour these men say they uphold, if the Son be judged
inferior to Him. But insult to the Son brings no honour to the good
Father. It cannot please the good Father, if the Son be judged inferior,
rather than equal, to His Father.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.vii-p3"></span>44. I pray your sacred Majesty to
suffer me, if for a little while I address myself particularly to these
men. But whom shall I choose out to cite? Eunomius? <span
id="fr_1750"></span>[1751](#fn_1750) or Arius and Aëtius, <span
id="fr_1751"></span>[1752](#fn_1751) his instructors? For there are many
names, but one unbelief, constant in wickedness, but in conversation
divided against itself; without difference in respect of deceit, but in
common enterprise breeding dissent. But wherefore they will not agree
together I understand not.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.vii-p6"></span>45. The Arians reject the person of
Eunomius, but they maintain his unbelief and walk in the ways of his
iniquity. They say that he has too generously published the writings of
Arius. Truly, a plentiful lavishing of error! They praise him who gave
the command, and deny him who executed it! Wherefore they have now
fallen apart into several sects. Some follow after Eunomius or Aëtius,
others after Palladius or Demophilus and Auxentius, or the inheritors of
this form of unbelief. <span id="fr_1752"></span>[1753](#fn_1752)
Others, again, follow different teachers. Is Christ, then,
divided? <span id="fr_1753"></span>[1754](#fn_1753) Nay; but those who
divide Him from the Father do with their own hands cut themselves
asunder.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.vii-p9"></span><span id="page_208">p. 208</span>
<span id="iv.iv.iii.vii-Page_208"></span>46. Seeing, therefore, that men
who agree not amongst themselves have all alike conspired against the
Church of God, I shall call those whom I have to answer by the common
name of heretics. For heresy, like some hydra of fable, hath waxed great
from its wounds, and, being ofttimes lopped short, hath grown afresh,
being appointed to find meet destruction in flames of fire. <span
id="fr_1754"></span>[1755](#fn_1754) Or, like some dread and monstrous
Scylla, divided into many shapes of unbelief, she displays, as a mask to
her guile, the pretence of being a Christian sect, but those wretched
men whom she finds tossed to and fro in the waves of her unhallowed
strait, amid the wreckage of their faith, she, girt with beastly
monsters, rends with the cruel fang of her blasphemous doctrine. <span
id="fr_1755"></span>[1756](#fn_1755)

<span id="iv.iv.iii.vii-p12"></span>47. This monster’s cavern, your
sacred Majesty, thick laid, as seafaring men do say it is, with hidden
lairs, and all the neighbourhood thereof, where the rocks of unbelief
echo to the howling of her black dogs, we must pass by with ears in a
manner stopped. For it is written: “Hedge thine ears about with
thorns;” <span id="fr_1756"></span>[1757](#fn_1756) and again: “Beware
of dogs, beware of evil workers;” <span
id="fr_1757"></span>[1758](#fn_1757) and yet again: “A man that is an
heretic, avoid after the first reproof, knowing that such an one is
fallen, and is in sin, being condemned of his own judgment.” <span
id="fr_1758"></span>[1759](#fn_1758) So then, like prudent pilots, let
us set the sails of our faith for the course wherein we may pass by most
safely, and again follow the coasts of the Scriptures. <span
id="fr_1759"></span>[1760](#fn_1759)

<span id="iv.iv.iii.vii-p4"></span> Eunomius, at one time Bishop of
Cyzicus, came into prominence about 355 <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.iii.vii-p4.1"></span>a.d.</span> Like Arius, he taught that
the Son was a creature, though the first and most perfect of God’s
creatures; His office being to guide other creatures to knowledge of the
source of their existence. Religion then in his view consisted in a
right and complete intellectual apprehension of a metaphysical
principle, and no more. The generation of the Son he regarded as an
event in time, not supra-temporal. The point where Eunomius went beyond
Arius was the assertion of the comprehensibility for the human mind of
the Divine Essence. Those, he said, who declared God to be in His
Essence incomprehensible, who taught that He could only know in part and
by token, preached an unknown God, and denied all possible knowledge of
God, and therefore, since without knowledge of God there could be no
Christianity, did not even deserve the name of Christians.

id="iv.iv.iii.vii-p4.2"></span>

<span id="iv.iv.iii.vii-p5"></span> Aëtius was Eunomius’ teacher. He
became Bishop of Antioch, the see of which was secured for him by the
Arian Eudoxius, who obtained Cyzicus for Eunomius. Aëtius and Eunomius
were, however, deposed about <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.iii.vii-p5.1"></span>a.d.</span> 360.

<span id="fn_1752"></span>[207:1753](2100189.htm#fr_1752) <span
id="iv.iv.iii.vii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iv.iii.vii-p7"></span> Demophilus was Bishop of
Constantinople under Valens (d. 378 <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.iii.vii-p7.1"></span>a.d.</span>), but on the accession of
Theodosius the Great he was compelled to resign the see, which was given
to Gregory of Nazianzus.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.vii-p10"></span> Hercules found it impossible to
slay the Hydra (a monster water snake) of the Lernean marshes by merely
striking off its head, inasmuch as whenever one was cut off, two
immediately grew in its place. He was compelled to sear the wound with
fire. One of the heads was immortal, and Hercules could only dispose of
it by crushing it under a huge rock.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.vii-p11"></span> For Scylla and Charybdis, see
Homer, *Odyss.* XI.; Virgil, *Æn.* III. 424 f. The strait, bestrewed
with wreckage of the faith ([1 Tim. i.
19](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#019)<span
id="iv.iv.iii.vii-p11.1"></span>) corresponds to the strait between the
rock of Scylla and the whirlpool Charybdis. In order to avoid the
latter, mariners were compelled to pass close under the former,
whereupon the monster darted out and seized them, dragging them out of a
ship as an angler whips a fish out of water (*Odyss.* XI. 251–255). The
language of this passage shows plainly that St. Ambrose, in writing it,
drew freely upon Virgil.
