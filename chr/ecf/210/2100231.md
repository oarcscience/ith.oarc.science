#### <span id="iv.iv.v.ix-p0.1"></span>Chapter IX.

<span id="iv.iv.v.ix-p1"></span>The preceding quotation from Solomon’s
Proverbs receives further explanation.

<span id="iv.iv.v.ix-p2"></span>59. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.v.ix-p2.1"></span>Perchance</span> you will ask how I came to
cite, as referring to the Incarnation of Christ, the place, “The Lord
created Me,” seeing that the creation of the universe took place before
the Incarnation of Christ? But consider that the use of holy Scripture
is to speak of things to come as though already past, and to make
intimation of the union of two natures, Godhead and Manhood, in Christ,
lest any should deny either His Godhead or His Manhood.

<span id="iv.iv.v.ix-p3"></span>60. In Isaiah, for example, you may
read: “A Child is born unto us, and a Son is given unto us;” so here
also \[in the Proverbs\] the prophet sets forth first the creation of
the flesh, and joined thereto the declaration of the Godhead, that you
might know that Christ is not two, but One, being both begotten of the
Father before the worlds, and in the last times <span
id="fr_2220"></span>[2221](#fn_2220) created of the Virgin. And thus the
meaning is: I, Who am begotten before the worlds, am He Who was created
of mortal woman, created for a set purpose.

<span id="iv.iv.v.ix-p5"></span>61. Again, immediately before the
declaration, “The Lord created Me,” He says, “I will tell of the things
which are from eternity,” and before saying, “He begat,” He premised,
“In the beginning, before He made the earth, before all hills.” In its
extent, the preposition “before” reaches back into the past without end
or limit, and so “Before Abraham was, I am,” <span
id="fr_2221"></span>[2222](#fn_2221) clearly need not mean “after Adam,”
just as “before the Morning Star” <span
id="fr_2222"></span>[2223](#fn_2222) need not mean “after the angels.”
But when He said “before,” He intended, not that He was included in any
one’s existence, but that all things are included in His, for thus it is
the custom of Holy Writ to show the eternity of God. Finally, in another
passage you may read: “Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever
the earth and the world were made, Thou art from everlasting to
everlasting.” <span id="fr_2223"></span>[2224](#fn_2223)

<span id="iv.iv.v.ix-p9"></span>62. Before all created things, then, is
the Son begotten; within all and for the good of all is He made;
begotten of the Father, above the Law, <span
id="fr_2224"></span>[2225](#fn_2224) brought forth of Mary, under the
Law. <span id="fr_2225"></span>[2226](#fn_2225)

[Next: Chapter X. Observations on the words of John the Baptist (John i.
30), which may be referred to divine fore-ordinance, but at any rate, as
explained by the foregoing considerations, must be understood of the
Incarnation. The precedence of Christ is mystically expounded, with
reference to the history of Ruth.](2100232)
