### <span id="iv.viii.xiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIII.

<span id="iv.viii.xiv-p1"></span>St. Ambrose, treating of the words in
the Gospel concerning eunuchs, condemns those who make themselves such.
Those only deserve praise who have through continence gained the victory
over themselves, but no one is to be compelled to live this life, as
neither Christ nor the Apostle laid down such a law, so that the
marriage vow is not to be blamed, though that of chastity is better.

<span id="iv.viii.xiv-p2"></span>75. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.viii.xiv-p2.1"></span>So</span>, then, a commandment to this
effect is not given, but a counsel is. Chastity is commanded, entire
continence counselled. “But all men cannot receive this saying, but they
to whom it is given. For there are eunuchs which were so born from their
mothers womb,” <span id="fr_3386"></span>[3387](#fn_3386.md) in whom exists
a natural necessity not the virtue of chastity. “And there are eunuchs
who have made themselves eunuchs,” of their own will, that is, not of
necessity. “And there are eunuchs which were made eunuchs of
men.…” <span id="fr_3387"></span>[3388](#fn_3387.md) And, therefore, great
is the grace of continence in them, because it is the will, not
incapacity, which makes a man continent. For it is seemly to preserve
the gift of divine working whole. And let them not think it too little
not to be impeded by the inclination of the body, for if the reward for
going through that conflict is taken from their reach, the matter of sin
is also removed, and though they cannot receive the crown, no more can
they be overcome. They have other kinds of virtues by which they ought
to commend themselves if their faith be firm, their mercifulness
abundant, avarice far from them, grace abundant. But in them there is no
fault, for they are ignorant of the act of sin.

<span id="iv.viii.xiv-p5"></span>76. The case is not the same of those
who mutilate themselves, and I touch upon this point advisedly, for
there are some who look upon it as a holy deed to check by the evil
violence of this sort. And though I am not willing to express my own
opinion concerning them, though decisions of our forefathers are in
existence; but then consider whether this tends not rather to a
declaration of weakness than to a reputation for strength. On this
principle no one should fight lest he be overcome, nor make use of his
feet, fearing the danger of stumbling, nor let his eyes do their office
because he fears a fall through lust. But what does it profit to cut the
flesh, when there may be guilt even in a look? “For whosoever looketh on
a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery already with her in
his heart.” <span id="fr_3388"></span>[3389](#fn_3388.md) And likewise she
who looks on a man to lust after him commits adultery. It becomes us,
then, to be chaste, not weak, to have our eyes modest, not feeble.

<span id="iv.viii.xiv-p7"></span>77. No one, then, ought, as many
suppose, to mutilate himself, but rather gain the victory; for the
Church gathers in those who conquer, not those who are defeated. And why
should I use arguments when the words of the Apostle’s command are at
hand? For you find it thus written: “I would that they were mutilated
who desire that you should be circumcised.” <span
id="fr_3389"></span>[3390](#fn_3389.md) For why should the means of gaining
a crown and of the practice of virtue be lost to a man who is born to
honour, equipped for victory? how can he through courage of soul
mutilate himself? “There be eunuchs which have made themselves eunuchs
for the kingdom of heaven’s sake.” <span
id="fr_3390"></span>[3391](#fn_3390.md)

<span id="iv.viii.xiv-p10"></span>78. This, however, is not a
commandment given to all, but a wish set before all. For he who commands
must always keep to the exact scope of the commandments, and he who
distributes tasks must observe equity in looking into them, for: “A
false balance is abomination to the Lord.” <span
id="fr_3391"></span>[3392](#fn_3391.md) There is, then, <span
id="page_405">p. 405</span> <span id="iv.viii.xiv-Page_405"></span>an
excess and a defect in weight, but the Church accepts neither, for:
“Excessive and defective weights and divers measures, both of them are
alike abominable in the sight of the Lord.” <span
id="fr_3392"></span>[3393](#fn_3392.md) There are tasks which wisdom
apportions, and apportions according to the estimate of the virtue and
strength of each. “He that is able to receive it let him receive
it.” <span id="fr_3393"></span>[3394](#fn_3393.md)

<span id="iv.viii.xiv-p14"></span>79. For the Creator of all knows that
the dispositions of each are different, and therefore incited virtue by
rewards, instead of binding weakness by chains. And he, the teacher of
the Gentiles, the good guide of our conduct, and instructor of our
inmost affections, who had learnt in himself that the law of the flesh
resists the law of the mind, but yields to the grace of Christ, he
knows, I say, that various movements of the mind are opposed to each
other; and, therefore, so expresses his exhortations to chastity, as not
to do away with the grace of marriage, nor has he so exalted marriage as
to check the desire of chastity. But beginning with the recommendation
of chastity, he goes on to remedies against incontinence, and having set
before the stronger the prize of their high calling, he suffers no one
to faint by the way; approving those who take the lead so as not to make
little of those who follow. For he, himself, had learnt that the Lord
Jesus gave to some barley bread <span
id="fr_3394"></span>[3395](#fn_3394.md) lest they should faint by the way,
and administered His Body to others, <span
id="fr_3395"></span>[3396](#fn_3395.md) that they might strive for the
kingdom.

<span id="iv.viii.xiv-p17"></span>80. For the Lord Himself did not
impose this commandment, but invited the will, and the Apostle did not
lay down a rule, but gave a counsel. <span
id="fr_3396"></span>[3397](#fn_3396.md) But this not a man’s counsel as to
things within the compass of man’s strength, for he acknowledges that
the gift of divine mercy was bestowed upon him, that he might know how
faithfully to set first the former, and to arrange the latter. And,
therefore, he says: “I think,” not, I order, but, “I think that this is
good because of the present distress.” <span
id="fr_3397"></span>[3398](#fn_3397.md)

<span id="iv.viii.xiv-p20"></span>81. The marriage bond is not then to
be shunned as though it were sinful, but rather declined as being a
galling burden. For the law binds the wife to bear children in labour
and in sorrow, and is in subjection to her husband, for that he is lord
over her. So, then, the married woman, but not the widow, is subject to
labour and pain in bringing forth children, and she only that is
married, not she that is a virgin, is under the power of her husband.
The virgin is free from all these things, who has vowed her affection to
the Word of God, who awaits the Spouse of blessing with her lamp burning
with the light of a good will. And so she is moved by counsels, not
bound by chains.

[Next: Chapter XIV. Though a widow may have received no commandment, yet
she has received so many counsels that she ought not to think little of
them. St. Ambrose would be sorry to lay any snare for her, seeing that
the field of the Church grows richer as a result of wedlock, but it is
absolutely impossible to deny that widowhood, which St. Paul praises, is
profitable. Consequently, he speaks severely about those who have
proscribed widowhood by law.](2100363.md)
