#### <span id="iv.i.iv.xxi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXI.

<span id="iv.i.iv.xxi-p1"></span>Esther in danger of her life followed
the grace of virtue; nay, even a heathen king did so, when death was
threatened to a man most friendly to him. For friendship must ever be
combined with virtue, as the examples of Jonathan and Ahimelech show.

<span id="iv.i.iv.xxi-p2"></span>123. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.iv.xxi-p2.1"></span>Why</span> did Queen Esther <span
id="fr_748"></span>[749](#fn_748.md) expose herself to death and not fear
the wrath of a fierce king? Was it not to save her people from death, an
act both seemly and virtuous? The king of Persia himself also, though
fierce and proud, yet thought it seemly to show honour to the man who
had given information about a plot which had been laid against
himself, <span id="fr_749"></span>[750](#fn_749.md) to save a free people
from slavery, to snatch them from death, and not to spare him who had
pressed on such unseemly plans. So finally he handed over to the
gallows <span id="fr_750"></span>[751](#fn_750.md) the man that stood
second to himself, and whom he counted chief among all his friends,
because he considered that he had dishonoured him by his false counsels.

<span id="iv.i.iv.xxi-p6"></span>124. For that commendable friendship
which maintains virtue is to be preferred most certainly to wealth, or
honours, or power. It is not wont to be preferred to virtue indeed, but
to follow after it. <span id="fr_751"></span>[752](#fn_751.md) So it was
with Jonathan, <span id="fr_752"></span>[753](#fn_752.md) who for his
affection’s sake avoided not his father’s displeasure nor the danger to
his own safety. So, too, it was with Ahimelech, who, to preserve the
duties of hospitality, thought he must endure death rather than betray
his friend when fleeing. <span id="fr_753"></span>[754](#fn_753.md)

[Next: Chapter XXII. Virtue must never be given up for the sake of a
friend. If, however, one has to bear witness against a friend, it must
be done with caution. Between friends what candour is needed in opening
the heart, what magnanimity in suffering, what freedom in finding fault!
Friendship is the guardian of virtues, which are not to be found but in
men of like character. It must be mild in rebuking and averse to seeking
its own advantage; whence it happens that true friends are scarce among
the rich. What is the dignity of friendship? The treachery of a friend,
as it is worse, so it is also more hateful than another's, as is
recognized from the example of Judas and of Job's friends.](2100116.md)
