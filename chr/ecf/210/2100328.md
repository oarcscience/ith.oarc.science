#### <span id="iv.vii.ii.viii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VIII.

<span id="iv.vii.ii.viii-p1"></span>Taking the passage concerning the
honeycomb in the Song of Songs, he expounds it, comparing the sacred
virgins to bees.

<span id="iv.vii.ii.viii-p2"></span>40. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vii.ii.viii-p2.1"></span>Let</span>, then, your work be as it
were a honeycomb, for virginity is fit to be compared to bees, so
laborious is it, so modest, so continent. The bee feeds on dew, it knows
no marriage couch, it makes honey. The virgin’s dew is the divine word,
for the words of God descend like the dew. The virgin’s modesty is
unstained nature. The virgin’s produce is the fruit of the lips, without
bitterness, abounding in sweetness. They work in common, and their fruit
is in common.

<span id="iv.vii.ii.viii-p3"></span>41. How I wish you, my daughter, to
be an imitator of these bees, whose food is flowers, whose offspring is
collected and brought together by the mouth. Do imitate her, my
daughter. Let no veil of deceit be spread over your words; let them have
no covering of guile, that they may be pure, and full of gravity.

<span id="iv.vii.ii.viii-p4"></span>42. And let an eternal succession of
merits be brought forth by your mouth. Gather not for yourself alone
(for how do you know when your soul shall be required of you?), lest
leaving your granaries heaped full with corn, which will be a help
neither to your life nor to your merits, you be hurried thither where
you cannot take your treasure with you. Be rich then, but towards the
poor, <span id="page_370">p. 370</span> <span
id="iv.vii.ii.viii-Page_370"></span>that as they share in your nature
they may also share your goods.

<span id="iv.vii.ii.viii-p5"></span>43. And I also point out to you what
flower is to be culled, that one it is Who said: “I am the Flower of the
field, and the Lily of the valleys, as a lily among thorns,” <span
id="fr_3200"></span>[3201](#fn_3200) which is a plain declaration that
virtues are surrounded by the thorns of spiritual wickedness, so that no
one can gather the fruit who does not approach with caution.

[Next: Chapter IX. Other passages from the Song of Songs are considered
with relation to the present subject, and St. Ambrose exhorting the
virgin to seek for Christ, points out where He may be found. A
description of His perfections follows, and a comparison is made between
virgins and the angels.](2100329)
