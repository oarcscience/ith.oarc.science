<span id="iv.i.ii.iii"></span>

#### <span id="iv.i.ii.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.

<span id="iv.i.ii.iii-p1"></span>Silence should not remain unbroken, nor
should it arise from idleness. How heart and mouth must be guarded
against inordinate affections.

<span id="iv.i.ii.iii-p2"></span>9. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.ii.iii-p2.1"></span>What</span> then? Ought we to be dumb?
Certainly not. For: “there is a time to keep silence and a time to
speak.” <span id="fr_42"></span>[43](#fn_42) If, then, we are to give
account for an idle word, let us take care that we do not have to give
it also for an idle silence. For there is also an active silence, such
as Susanna’s was, who did more by keeping silence than if she had
spoken. For in keeping silence before men she spoke to God, and found no
greater proof of her chastity than silence. Her conscience spoke where
no word was heard, and she sought no judgment for herself at the hands
of men, for she had the witness of the Lord. She therefore desired to be
acquitted by Him, Who she knew could not be deceived in any way. <span
id="fr_43"></span>[44](#fn_43) Yea, the Lord Himself in the Gospel
worked out in silence the salvation of men. <span
id="fr_44"></span>[45](#fn_44) David rightly therefore enjoined on
himself not constant silence, but watchfulness.

<span id="iv.i.ii.iii-p6"></span>10. Let us then guard our hearts, let
us guard our mouths. Both have been written about. In this place we are
bidden to take heed to our mouth; in another place thou art told: “Keep
thy heart with all diligence.” <span id="fr_45"></span>[46](#fn_45) If
David took heed, wilt thou not <span id="page_3">p. 3</span> <span
id="iv.i.ii.iii-Page_3"></span>take heed? If Isaiah had unclean lips—who
said: “Woe is me, for I am undone, for I am a man, and have unclean
lips” <span id="fr_46"></span>[47](#fn_46) —if a prophet of the Lord had
unclean lips, how shall we have them clean?

<span id="iv.i.ii.iii-p9"></span>11. But for whom was it written, unless
it was for each one of us: “Hedge thy possession about with thorns, and
bind up thy silver and gold, and make a door and a bar for thy mouth,
and a yoke and a balance for thy words”? <span
id="fr_47"></span>[48](#fn_47) Thy possession is thy mind, thy gold thy
heart, thy silver thy speech: “The words of the Lord are pure words, as
silver tried in the fire.” <span id="fr_48"></span>[49](#fn_48) A good
mind is also a good possession. And, further, a pure inner life is a
valuable possession. Hedge in, then, this possession of thine, enclose
it with thought, guard it with thorns, that is, with pious care, lest
the fierce passions of the flesh should rush upon it and lead it
captive, lest strong emotions should assault it, and, overstepping their
bounds, carry off its vintage. Guard thy inner self. Do not neglect or
contemn it as though it were worthless, for it is a valuable possession;
truly valuable indeed, for its fruit is not perishable and only for a
time, but is lasting and of use for eternal salvation. Cultivate,
therefore, thy possession, and let it be thy tilling ground.

<span id="iv.i.ii.iii-p12"></span>12. Bind up thy words that they run
not riot, and grow wanton, and gather up sins for themselves in too much
talking. Let them be rather confined, and held back within their own
banks. An overflowing river quickly gathers mud. Bind up also thy
meaning; let it not be left slack and unchecked, lest it be said of
thee: “There is no healing balsam, nor oil, nor bandage to apply.” <span
id="fr_49"></span>[50](#fn_49) Sobriety of mind has its reins, whereby
it is directed and guided.

<span id="iv.i.ii.iii-p14"></span>13. Let there be a door to thy mouth,
that it may be shut when need arises, and let it be carefully barred,
that none may rouse thy voice to anger, and thou pay back abuse with
abuse. Thou hast heard it read to-day: “Be ye angry and sin not.” <span
id="fr_50"></span>[51](#fn_50) Therefore although we are angry (this
arising from the motions of our nature, not of our will), let us not
utter with our mouth one evil word, lest we fall into sin; but let there
be a yoke and a balance to thy words, that is, humility and moderation,
that thy tongue may be subject to thy mind. Let it be held in check with
a tight rein; let it have its own means of restraint, whereby it can be
recalled to moderation; let it utter words tried by the scales of
justice, that there may be seriousness in our meaning, weight in our
speech, and due measure in our words.
