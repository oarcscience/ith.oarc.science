#### <span id="iv.i.iv.xii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XII.

<span id="iv.i.iv.xii-p1"></span>We may make no promise that is wrong,
and if we have made an unjust oath, we may not keep it. It is shown that
Herod sinned in this respect. The vow taken by Jephtha is condemned, and
so are all others which God does not desire to have paid to Him. Lastly,
the daughter of Jephtha is compared with the two Pythagoreans and is
placed before them.

<span id="iv.i.iv.xii-p2"></span>76. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.iv.xii-p2.1"></span>A man’s</span> disposition ought to be
undefiled and sound, so that he may utter words without dissimulation
and possess his vessel in sanctification; <span
id="fr_676"></span>[677](#fn_676) that he may not delude his brother
with false words nor promise aught dishonourable. If he has made such a
promise it is far better for him not to fulfil it, rather than to fulfil
what is shameful. <span id="fr_677"></span>[678](#fn_677)

<span id="iv.i.iv.xii-p5"></span>77. Often people bind themselves by a
solemn oath, and, though they come to know that they ought not to have
made the promise, fulfil it in consideration of their oath. This is what
Herod did, as we mentioned before. <span
id="fr_678"></span>[679](#fn_678) For he made a shameful promise of
reward to a dancer—and cruelly performed it. It was shameful, for a
kingdom was promised for a dance; and it was cruel, for the death of a
prophet is sacrificed for the sake of an oath. How much better perjury
would have been than the keeping of such an oath, if indeed that could
be called perjury which a drunkard had sworn to in his wine-cups, or an
effeminate profligate had promised whilst the dance was going on. The
prophet’s head was brought in on a dish, <span
id="fr_679"></span>[680](#fn_679) and this was considered an act of good
faith when it really was an act of madness!

<span id="iv.i.iv.xii-p8"></span>78. Never shall I be led to believe
that the leader Jephtha made his vow otherwise than without
thought, <span id="fr_680"></span>[681](#fn_680) when he promised to
offer to God whatever should meet him at the threshold of his house on
his return. For he repented of his vow, as afterwards his daughter came
to meet him. He rent his clothes and said: “Alas, my daughter, thou hast
entangled me, thou art become a source of trouble unto me.” <span
id="fr_681"></span>[682](#fn_681) And though with pious fear and
reverence he took upon himself the bitter fulfilment of his cruel task,
yet he ordered and left to be observed an annual period of grief and
mourning for future times. It was a hard vow, but far more bitter was
its fulfilment, whilst he who carried it out had the greatest cause to
mourn. Thus it became a rule and a law in Israel from year to year, as
it says: “that the daughters of Israel went to lament the daughter of
Jephtha the Gileadite four days in a year.” <span
id="fr_682"></span>[683](#fn_682) I cannot blame the man for holding it
necessary to fulfil his vow, but yet it was a wretched necessity which
could only be solved by the death of his child.

<span id="iv.i.iv.xii-p12"></span>79. It is better to make no vow than
to vow what God does not wish to be paid to Him to Whom the promise was
made. In the case of Isaac we have an example, for the Lord appointed a
ram to be offered up instead of him. <span
id="fr_683"></span>[684](#fn_683) Therefore it is not always every
promise that is to be fulfilled. Nay, the Lord Himself often alters His
determination, as the Scriptures point out. For in the book called
Numbers He had declared that He would punish the people with death and
destroy them, <span id="fr_684"></span>[685](#fn_684) but afterwards,
when besought by Moses, He was reconciled again to them. And again, He
said to Moses and Aaron: “Separate yourselves from among this
congregation that I may consume them in a moment.” <span
id="fr_685"></span>[686](#fn_685) And when they separated from the
assembly the earth suddenly clave asunder and opened her mouth and
swallowed up Dathan and Abiram.

<span id="iv.i.iv.xii-p16"></span>80. That example of Jephtha’s daughter
is far more glorious and ancient than that of the two
Pythagoreans, <span id="fr_686"></span>[687](#fn_686) which is accounted
so notable among the philosophers. One of these, when condemned to death
by the tyrant Dionysius, and when the day of his death was fixed, asked
for leave to be granted him to go home, so as to provide for his family.
But for fear that he might break his faith and not return, he offered a
surety for his own death, on condition that if he himself were absent on
the appointed day, his surety would be ready to die in his stead. The
other did not refuse the conditions of suretyship which were proposed
and awaited the day of death with a calm mind. So the one did not
withdraw himself and the other returned on the day appointed. This all
seemed so wonderful that the tyrant sought their friendship whose
destruction he had been anxious for.

<span id="iv.i.iv.xii-p18"></span>81. What, then, in the case of
esteemed and learned men is full of marvel, that in the case of a virgin
is found to be far more splendid, far more glorious, as she says to her
sorrowing father: “Do to me according to that which hath proceeded out
of thy mouth.” <span id="fr_687"></span>[688](#fn_687) But she asked for
a delay of two months in order that she might go about <span
id="page_81">p. 81</span> <span id="iv.i.iv.xii-Page_81"></span>with her
companions upon the mountains to bewail fitly and dutifully her
virginity now given up to death. The weeping of her companions did not
move her, their grief prevailed not upon her, nor did their lamentations
hold her back. She allowed not the day to pass, nor did the hour escape
her notice. She returned to her father as though returning according to
her own desire, and of her own will urged him on when he was hesitating,
and acted thus of her own free choice, so that what was at first an
awful chance became a pious sacrifice.
