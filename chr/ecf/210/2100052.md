#### <span id="iv.i.ii.xl-p0.1"></span>Chapter XL.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xl-p1"></span>Courage in war was not wanting in our
forefathers, as is shown by the example of the men of old, especially by
the glorious deed of Eleazar.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xl-p2"></span>205. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.ii.xl-p2.1"></span>But</span> perhaps renown in war keeps some
so bound to itself <span id="fr_296"></span>[297](#fn_296.md) as to make
them think that fortitude is to be found in battle alone, and that
therefore I had gone aside to speak of these things, because that was
wanting in us. But how brave was Joshua the son of Nun, who in one
battle laid low five kings together with their people! <span
id="fr_297"></span>[298](#fn_297.md) Again, when he fought against the
Gibeonites and feared that night might stop him from gaining the
victory, he called out with deep faith and high spirit: <span
id="fr_298"></span>[299](#fn_298.md) “Let the sun stand still;” and it
stood still until the victory was complete. Gideon with three hundred
men gained a triumph over a great nation and a cruel foe. <span
id="fr_299"></span>[300](#fn_299.md) Jonathan when a young man showed great
courage in battle, <span id="fr_300"></span>[301](#fn_300.md) and what
shall I say about the Maccabees?

<span id="iv.i.ii.xl-p8"></span>206. First, I will speak of the people
of our fathers. They were ready to fight for the temple of God and for
their rights, and when attacked on the Sabbath day by the craft of the
enemy, willingly allowed wounds to be inflicted on their unprotected
bodies, rather than to join in the fight, so that they might not defile
the Sabbath. <span id="fr_301"></span>[302](#fn_301.md) They all gladly
gave themselves up to death. But the Maccabees thinking that then all
the nation would perish, on the Sabbath also, when they were challenged
to fight, took vengeance for the death of their innocent brethren. And
afterwards when he had been roused by this to fresh exertions, King
Antiochus, having begun the war afresh under the leadership of his
generals Lysias, Nicanor, and Georgias, was so utterly crushed, together
with his Eastern and Assyrian forces, that he left 48,000 lying on the
battle-field, slain by an army of but 3,000 men.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xl-p10"></span><span id="page_34">p. 34</span> <span
id="iv.i.ii.xl-Page_34"></span>207. Mark the courage of the leader,
Judas Maccabæus, as exemplified in the character of one of his soldiers.
Eleazar, <span id="fr_302"></span>[303](#fn_302.md) meeting with an
elephant higher than all the rest, and with all the royal trappings upon
it, and thinking that the king was on it, ran hastily and threw himself
into the midst of the legion; and, casting away his shield, with both
hands he slew those opposed to him until he reached the beast. <span
id="fr_303"></span>[304](#fn_303.md) Then he got beneath it, thrust in his
sword and slew it. But the beast in falling crushed Eleazar and so
killed him. What courage of mind was his then, first, in that he feared
not death, next because, when surrounded by enemies, he was carried by
it into the thickest of his foes and penetrated the very centre! Then,
despising death, and casting away his shield, he ran beneath the huge
beast, wounded it with both his hands, and let it fall upon him. He ran
beneath it so as to give a more deadly blow. Enclosed by its fall,
rather than crushed, he was buried in his own triumph.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xl-p13"></span>208. Nor was he deceived in his
intention though he was deceived by the royal ornaments. For the enemy,
startled at such an exhibition of valour, dared not rush upon this
single unarmed man, held fast though he was. They were so terrified
after the mischance of the slaughter of the beast, that they considered
themselves altogether unequal to the valour of one. Nay, King Antiochus,
son of Lysias, terrified at the fortitude of one, asked for peace. He
had come to the war with 120,000 armed men and with 32 elephants, which
glittered and gleamed with the sheen of arms like a line of burning
lamps, as the sun rose upon them, marching along one by one, like very
mountains for size. <span id="fr_304"></span>[305](#fn_304.md) Thus Eleazar
left peace as the heir of his courage. These are the signs of triumphs.

mind, the constancy of the martyrs in their endurance of tortures, which
is no small part of fortitude, is next brought before us.](2100053.md)
