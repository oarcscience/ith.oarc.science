<span id="iv.iv.vii.ii"></span>

#### <span id="iv.iv.vii.ii-p0.1"></span>Chapter I.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.ii-p1"></span>How impious the Arians are, in
attacking that on which human happiness depends. John ever unites the
Son with the Father, especially where he says: “That they may know Thee,
the only true God, etc.” In that place, then, we must understand the
words “true God” also of the Son; for it cannot be denied that He is
God, and it cannot be said He is a false god, and least of all that He
is God by appellation only. This last point being proved from the
Apostle’s words, we rightly confess that Christ is true God.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.ii-p2"></span>16. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.vii.ii-p2.1"></span>Wherefore</span> let the Arians observe,
how impious they are in calling in question our hope and the object of
our desires. And since they are wont to cry out on this point above all
others, saying that Christ is distinct from the only and true God, let
us confute their impious ideas so far as lies in our power.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.ii-p3"></span>17. For on this point they ought
rather to understand, that this is the benefit, this the reward of
perfect virtue, namely, this divine and incomparable gift, that we may
know Christ together with the Father, and not separate the Son from the
Father; as also the Scriptures do not separate them. For the following
tells rather for the unity than for the diversity of the Divine Majesty,
namely, that the knowledge of the Father and of the Son gives us the
same recompense, and one and the same honour; which reward no man will
have but he that has known both the Father and the Son. For as the
knowledge of the Father procures eternal life, so also does the
knowledge of the Son.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.ii-p4"></span>18. Therefore as the Evangelist
forthwith at the outset joined the Word with God the Father in his
devout confession of faith, saying: “And the Word was with God;” <span
id="fr_2532"></span>[2533](#fn_2532) and here too, in writing the words
of the Lord: “That they may know Thee, the only true God, and Jesus
Christ Whom Thou hast sent,” <span id="fr_2533"></span>[2534](#fn_2533)
he has undoubtedly, by thus connecting Them, bound together the Father
and the Son, so that no one may separate Christ as true God from the
majesty of the Father, for union does not dissever.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.ii-p7"></span>19. Therefore in saying, “That they
may know Thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ Whom Thou hast sent,”
he put an end to the Sabellians, and has also put the Jews out of
court,—those at any rate who heard him speak; so that the former might
not suppose the Same to be the Father as the Son, which they might have
done if he had not added also Christ, and that the latter might not
sever the Son from the Father.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.ii-p8"></span>20. But, I ask, why do they not think
we ought to gather and understand this from what has been already said;
that as he has declared the Father to be only, true God, so we may
understand Jesus Christ also to be only, true God? For it could not be
expressed in any other way, for fear he might seem to be speaking of two
Gods. For neither do we speak of two Gods; and yet we confess the Son to
be of the same Godhead with the Father.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.ii-p9"></span>21. May we ask, therefore, on what
grounds they think a distinction is made in the Godhead, and whether
they deny Christ to be God? But they cannot deny it. Do they deny Him to
be true God? But if they <span id="page_287">p. 287</span> <span
id="iv.iv.vii.ii-Page_287"></span>deny Him to be true God, let them say
whether they declare Him to be a false God, or God by appellation only.
For according to the Scriptures the word “God” is used either of the
true God, or by appellation only, or of a false god. True God as the
Father; God by appellation as the saints; a false god like the demons
and idols. Let them say then how they will acknowledge and describe the
Son of God. Do they suppose the name of God to have been falsely
assumed; or was there in truth merely an indwelling of God within Him,
as it were by appellation only?

<span id="iv.iv.vii.ii-p10"></span>22. I do not think they can say the
name was falsely assumed, and so involve themselves in the open
wickedness of blasphemy; lest they should betray themselves on the one
hand to the demons and idols, and on the other to Christ, by insinuating
that the name of God was falsely given to Him. But if they think He is
called God because He had an indwelling of the Godhead within Him,—as
many holy men were (for the Scripture calls them Gods to whom the word
of God came), <span id="fr_2534"></span>[2535](#fn_2534) —they do not
place Him before other men, but think He is to be compared with them; so
that they consider Him to be the same as He has granted other men to be,
even as He says to Moses: “I have made thee a god unto Pharaoh.” <span
id="fr_2535"></span>[2536](#fn_2535) Wherefore it is also said in the
Psalms: “I have said, ye are gods.” <span
id="fr_2536"></span>[2537](#fn_2536)

<span id="iv.iv.vii.ii-p14"></span>23. This idea of these blasphemers
Paul puts aside; for he said: “For though there be that are called gods,
whether in heaven or in earth.” <span
id="fr_2537"></span>[2538](#fn_2537) He said not: “There be gods,” but
“There be that are called gods.” But “Christ,” as it is written, “is the
same yesterday and to-day.” <span id="fr_2538"></span>[2539](#fn_2538)
“He is,” it says; that is, not only in name but also in truth.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.ii-p17"></span>24. And well is it written: “He is
the same yesterday and to-day,” so that the impiety of Arius might find
no room to pile up its profanity. For he, in reading in the second psalm
of the Father saying to the Son, “Thou art My Son, this day have I
begotten Thee,” <span id="fr_2539"></span>[2540](#fn_2539) noted the
word “to-day,” not “yesterday,” referring this which was spoken of the
assumption of our flesh to the eternity of the divine generation; of
which Paul also says in the Acts of the Apostles: “And we declare unto
you the promise which was made to our fathers: for God has fulfilled the
same to our children, in that He hath raised up the Lord Jesus Christ
again, as it is written in the second psalm: Thou art My Son, this day
have I begotten Thee.” <span id="fr_2540"></span>[2541](#fn_2540) Thus
the Apostle, filled with the Holy Ghost, in order that he might destroy
that fierce madness of his, said: “The same, yesterday, to-day, and for
ever.” “Yesterday” on account of His eternity; “to-day” on account of
His taking to Himself a human body.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.ii-p20"></span>25. Christ therefore is, and always
is; for He, Who is, always is. And Christ always is, of Whom Moses says:
“He that is hath sent me.” <span id="fr_2541"></span>[2542](#fn_2541)
Gabriel indeed was, Raphael was, the angels were; but they who sometime
have not been are by no means with equal reason said always to be. But
Christ, as we read, “was not it is, and, it is not, but, it is was in
Him.” <span id="fr_2542"></span>[2543](#fn_2542) Wherefore it is the
property of God alone to be, Who ever is.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.ii-p23"></span>26. Therefore if they dare not say He
is God by appellation, and it is a mark of deep impiety to say He is a
false god, it remains that He is true God, not unlike to the true
Father, but equal to Him. And as He sanctifies and justifies whom He
will, <span id="fr_2543"></span>[2544](#fn_2543) not by assuming that
power from without Himself, but having within Himself the power of
sanctification, how is He not true God? For the Apostle called Him
indeed true God, Who according to His nature was God, as it is written:
“Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them, who by
nature were not gods;” <span id="fr_2544"></span>[2545](#fn_2544) that
is, who could not be true gods, for this title by no means belonged to
them by nature.

[Next: Chapter II. Since it has been proved that the Son is true God,
and in that is not inferior to the Father, it is shown that by the word
solus (alone) when used of the Father in the Scriptures, the Son is not
excluded; nay, that this expression befits Him above all, and Him alone.
The Trinity is alone, not amongst all, but above all. The Son alone does
what the Father does, and alone has immortality. But we must not for
this reason separate Him from the Father in our controversies. We may,
however, understand that passage of the Incarnation. Lastly the Father
is shut out from a share in the redemption of men by those who would
have the Son to be separated from Him.](2100256)
