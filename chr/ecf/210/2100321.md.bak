<span id="iv.vii.ii.i"></span>

#### <span id="iv.vii.ii.i-p0.1"></span>Chapter I.

<span id="iv.vii.ii.i-p1"></span>St. Ambrose, reflecting upon the
account he will have to give of his talents, determines to write, and
consoles himself with certain examples of God’s mercy. Then recognizing
his own deficiencies desires that he may be dealt with like the fig-tree
in the Gospel, and expresses a hope that words will not fail him in his
endeavour to preach Christ.

<span id="iv.vii.ii.i-p2"></span>1. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vii.ii.i-p2.1"></span>If</span>, according to the decree of
heavenly truth, we have to give account of every idle word which we have
spoken, <span id="fr_3160"></span>[3161](#fn_3160.md) and if every servant
will incur no small blame when his lord returns, who, either like a
timid money-lender or covetous owner, has hidden in the earth the
talents of spiritual grace which were entrusted to him in order that
they might be multiplied by increasing interest, I, who, although
possessed of but moderate ability, yet have a great necessity laid on me
of making increase of the sayings of God entrusted to me, must rightly
fear lest an account of the profit of my words be demanded of me,
especially seeing that the Lord exacts of us effort, not profit.
Wherefore I determined to write something, since, too, my words are
listened to with greater risk to modesty than when they are written, for
a book has no feeling of modesty.

<span id="iv.vii.ii.i-p4"></span>2. And so distrusting indeed my own
ability, but encouraged by the instances of divine mercy, I venture to
compose an address, for when God willed even the ass spoke. <span
id="fr_3161"></span>[3162](#fn_3161.md) And I will open my mouth long dumb,
that the angel may assist me also, engaged in the burdens of this world,
for He can do away with the hindrances of unskilfulness, Who in the ass
did away those of nature. In the ark of the Old Testament the priest’s
rod budded; <span id="fr_3162"></span>[3163](#fn_3162.md) with God it is
easy that in Holy Church a flower should spring from our knots also. And
why should we despair that God should speak in men, Who spoke in the
thorn bush? <span id="fr_3163"></span>[3164](#fn_3163.md) God did not
despise the bush, and would He might give light also to my thorns.
Perhaps some may wonder that there is some light even in our thorns;
some our thorns will not burn; there will be some whose shoes shall be
put off their feet at the sound of my voice, that the steps of the mind
may be freed from bodily hindrances.

<span id="iv.vii.ii.i-p8"></span>3. But these things are gained by holy
men. Would that Jesus would cast a glance upon me still lying under that
barren fig-tree, <span id="fr_3164"></span>[3165](#fn_3164.md) and that my
fig-tree might also after three years bear fruit. <span
id="fr_3165"></span>[3166](#fn_3165.md) But whence should sinners have so
great hope? Would that at least that Gospel dresser of the vineyard,
perhaps already bidden to cut down my fig-tree, would let it alone this
year also, until he dig about it and dung it, that he may perchance lift
the helpless out of the dust, and lift the poor out of the mire. <span
id="fr_3166"></span>[3167](#fn_3166.md) Blessed are they who bind their
horses under the vine and olive, <span
id="fr_3167"></span>[3168](#fn_3167.md) consecrating the course of their
labours to light and joy: the fig-tree, that is, the tempting attraction
of the pleasures of the world, still overshadows me, low in height,
brittle for working, soft for use, and barren of fruit.

<span id="iv.vii.ii.i-p13"></span>4. And perhaps some one may wonder why
I, who cannot speak, venture to write. And yet if we consider what we
read in the writings of the Gospel, and the deeds of the priests, and
the holy prophet Zacharias is <span id="page_364">p. 364</span> <span
id="iv.vii.ii.i-Page_364"></span>taken as an instance, he will find that
there is something which the voice cannot explain, but the pen can
write. And if the name John restored speech to his father, <span
id="fr_3168"></span>[3169](#fn_3168.md) I, too, ought not to despair that
although dumb I may yet receive speech, if I speak of Christ, of Whom,
according to the prophet’s word: “Who shall declare the
generation?” <span id="fr_3169"></span>[3170](#fn_3169.md) And so as a
servant I will announce the family of the Lord, for the Lord has
consecrated to Himself a family even in this body of humanity replete
with frailty.

[Next: Chapter II. This treatise has a favourable beginning, since it is
the birthday of the holy Virgin Agnes, of whose name, modesty, and
martyrdom St. Ambrose speaks in commendation, but more especially of her
age, seeing that she, being but twelve years old, was superior to
terrors, promises, tortures, and death itself, with a courage wholly
worthy of a man.](2100322.md)
