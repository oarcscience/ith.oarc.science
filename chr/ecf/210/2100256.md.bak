#### <span id="iv.iv.vii.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter II.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.iii-p1"></span>*Since it has been proved that the
Son is true God, and in that is not inferior to the Father, it is shown
that by the word* solus *(alone) when used of the Father in the
Scriptures, the Son is not excluded; nay, that this expression befits
Him above all, and Him alone. The Trinity is alone, not amongst all, but
above all. The Son alone does what the Father does, and alone has
immortality. But we must not for this reason separate Him from the
Father in our controversies. We may, however, understand that passage of
the Incarnation. Lastly the Father is shut out from a share in the
redemption of men by those who would have the Son to be separated from
Him.*

<span id="iv.iv.vii.iii-p2"></span>27. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.vii.iii-p2.1"></span>We</span> have fully demonstrated by
passages of Scripture, in the earlier books, that Christ is true, yea,
very true God. Therefore if Christ, as it has been taught, is true God,
let us enquire why they desire to separate the Son from the Father, when
they read that the Father is the only true God.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.iii-p3"></span><span id="page_288">p. 288</span>
<span id="iv.iv.vii.iii-Page_288"></span>28. If they say that the Father
alone is true God, they cannot deny that God the Son alone is the Truth;
for Christ is the Truth. Is the Truth then something inferior to Him
that is true, seeing that according to the use of terms a man is called
true from the word “truth,” as also wise from wisdom, just from justice?
We do not deem it so between the Father and the Son. For there is
nothing wanting to the Father, because the Father is full of truth; and
the Son, because He is the Truth, is equal to Him that is true.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.iii-p4"></span>29. But that they may know, when they
see the word “alone,” that the Son is in no wise to be separated from
the Father, let them remember it was said by God in the Prophets: “I
stretched forth the heavens alone.” <span
id="fr_2545"></span>[2546](#fn_2545.md) The Father certainly did not
stretch them forth without the Son. For the Son Himself, Who is the
Wisdom of God, says: “When He prepared the heavens I was present with
Him.” <span id="fr_2546"></span>[2547](#fn_2546.md) And Paul declares that
it was said of the Son: “Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the
foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the work of Thy
hands.” <span id="fr_2547"></span>[2548](#fn_2547.md) Whether therefore the
Son made the heavens, as also the Apostle would have it understood,
whilst He Himself certainly did not alone spread out the heavens without
the Father; or as it stands in the Book of Proverbs: “The Lord in wisdom
hath founded the earth, in understanding hath He prepared the
heavens;” <span id="fr_2548"></span>[2549](#fn_2548.md) it is proved that
neither the Father made the heavens alone without the Son, nor yet the
Son without the Father. And yet He who spread out the heavens is said to
be alone.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.iii-p9"></span>30. To show indeed how plainly we
must understand the expression “alone” of the Son (although we may never
believe that He did anything without the knowledge of the Father), we
have here also another passage, where it is written: “Which alone
spreadeth out the heavens, and walketh as it were on a pavement over the
sea.” <span id="fr_2549"></span>[2550](#fn_2549.md) For the Gospel of the
Lord has taught us that it was not the Father but the Son that walked
upon the sea, when Peter asked Him, saying, “Lord, bid me come unto
Thee.” <span id="fr_2550"></span>[2551](#fn_2550.md) But even prophecy
itself gives proof of this. For holy Job prophesied of the coming of the
Lord; of Whom he said in truth that He would vanquish the great
Leviathan, <span id="fr_2551"></span>[2552](#fn_2551.md) and it was done.
For that dread Leviathan that is, the devil, He smote, and struck down,
and laid low in the last times by the adorable Passion of His own
Body. <span id="fr_2552"></span>[2553](#fn_2552.md)

<span id="iv.iv.vii.iii-p14"></span>31. The Son therefore is only and
true God for this also is assigned to the Son as His sole right. For of
no created being can it be accurately said that he is alone. How can he
to whom fellowship in creation belongs be separated from the rest, as
though he were alone? Thus man is seen to be a rational being amongst
all earthly creatures, yet he is not the only rational being; for we
know that the heavenly works of God also are rational, we confess that
angels and archangels are rational beings. If then the angels are
rational, man cannot be said to be the only rational being.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.iii-p15"></span>32. But they say that the sun can be
said to be alone, because there is no second sun. But the sun himself
has many things in common with the stars, for he travels across the
heavens, he is of that ethereal and heavenly substance, he is a
creature, and is reckoned amongst all the works of God. He serves God in
union with all, blesses Him with all, praises Him with all. <span
id="fr_2553"></span>[2554](#fn_2553.md) Therefore he cannot accurately be
said to be alone, for he is not set apart from the rest.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.iii-p17"></span>33. Wherefore since no created being
can be compared with the Godhead of the Father, the Son, and the Holy
Ghost, Which is alone, not amongst all, but over all (our declaration
concerning the Spirit being meanwhile held back); as the Father is said
to be the only true God, because He has nothing in common with others;
so also is the Son alone the Image of the true God, He alone is the Hand
of the Father, He alone is the Virtue and Wisdom of God.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.iii-p18"></span>34. Thus the Son alone does what the
Father does; for it is written: “Whatsoever things I do, He doth.” <span
id="fr_2554"></span>[2555](#fn_2554.md) And since the work of the Father
and of the Son is one, it is well said of the Father and the Son, that
God worked alone; wherefore also when we speak of the Creator, we own
both the Father and the Son. For assuredly when Paul said, “Who served
the creature more than the Creator,” <span
id="fr_2555"></span>[2556](#fn_2555.md) he neither denied the Father to be
the Creator, from Whom are all these things, nor yet the Son, through
Whom are all things. <span id="fr_2556"></span>[2557](#fn_2556.md)

<span id="iv.iv.vii.iii-p22"></span>35. And it does not seem out of
agreement with this that it is written: “Who alone hath
immortality.” <span id="fr_2557"></span>[2558](#fn_2557.md) For how could
He not have immortality Who has life in Himself? He has it in His
nature; He has it in His essential Being; and He has it not as a
temporal <span id="page_289">p. 289</span> <span
id="iv.iv.vii.iii-Page_289"></span>grace, but owing to His eternal
Godhead. He has it not by way of a gift as a servant, but by peculiar
right of His Generation, as the co-eternal Son. He has it, too, as has
the Father. “For as the Father hath life in Himself, so also hath He
given to the Son to have life in Himself.” <span
id="fr_2558"></span>[2559](#fn_2558.md) As He has it, it says, so He has
given it. Thou hast learnt already how He gave it, <span
id="fr_2559"></span>[2560](#fn_2559.md) that thou mayest not think it to be
a free gift of grace, when it is a secret of His generation. Since,
then, there is no divergence of life between the Father and the Son, how
can it be supposed that the Father alone has immortality, whilst the Son
has it not?

<span id="iv.iv.vii.iii-p26"></span>36. Wherefore let them understand
that in this passage the Son is not to be separated from the Father, Who
is the only true God. For they cannot prove that the Son is not the only
and true God, especially as here also it may be gathered, as I have
said, that Christ too is true and only God; or the passage may at least
be understood partly in reference to the Godhead of the Father and the
Son, and partly to the Incarnation of Christ: for knowledge is not
perfect unless it confesses Jesus Christ from eternity to be
only-begotten God, true Son of God, and, according to the flesh,
begotten of a Virgin. Which also this very Evangelist has taught us
elsewhere, saying: “Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is
come in the flesh, is of God.” <span
id="fr_2560"></span>[2561](#fn_2560.md)

<span id="iv.iv.vii.iii-p28"></span>37. Lastly, the whole of our passage
teaches us that it is not improper in this verse to understand a
reference to the sacrament of the Incarnation. For thus it is written:
“Father, the hour is come, glorify Thy Son.” <span
id="fr_2561"></span>[2562](#fn_2561.md) When, therefore, He states that the
hour is come, and prays to be glorified, how can one suppose Him to have
spoken but only in accordance with the assumption of our flesh? For the
Godhead has no fixed moments of time, nor does eternal light stand in
need of glorification. Therefore in the only true God, Who is the
Father, we also understand the only true Son of God to be in accordance
with the unity of the Godhead. And in the name of Jesus Christ, which He
received when born of the Virgin, we acknowledge the sacrament of the
Incarnation.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.iii-p30"></span>38. But if they wish to separate the
Son, when they read that the Father is the only true God, I suppose that
when they read of the Incarnation of the Son: “This is the stone which
was set at naught of you builders, which is become the head of the
corner;” and further: “There is none other name under heaven given among
men, whereby we must be saved;” <span
id="fr_2562"></span>[2563](#fn_2562.md) then they imagine the Father is to
be cut off from the benefit of imparting salvation to us. But there is
neither salvation without the Father, nor eternal life without the Son.

[Next: Chapter III. To the objection of the Arians, that two Gods are
introduced by a unity of substance, the answer is that a plurality of
Gods is more likely to be inferred from diversity of substance. Further,
their charge recoils upon themselves. Manifold diversity is the reason
why two men cannot be said to be one man, though all men are called
individually man, where a unity of nature is referred to. There is one
nature alone in them, but there is wholly a unity in the Divine Persons.
Therefore the Son is not to be severed from the Father, especially as
they dare not deny that worship is due to Him.](2100257.md)
