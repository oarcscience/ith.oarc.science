#### <span id="iv.vi.ii.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.iv-p1"></span>St. Ambrose proceeds with the proof of
the divine mercy, and shows by the testimony of the Gospels that it
prevails over severity, and he adduces the instance of athletes to show
that of those who have denied Christ before men, all are not to be
esteemed alike.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.iv-p2"></span>15. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.iv-p2.1"></span>Although</span> what has been said
sufficiently shows how inclined the Lord Jesus is to mercy, let Him
further instruct us with His own words, when He would arm us against the
assaults of persecution. “Fear <span id="page_332">p. 332</span> <span
id="iv.vi.ii.iv-Page_332"></span>not,” He says, “those who kill the
body, but cannot kill the soul, but rather fear Him Who can cast both
body and soul into hell.” <span id="fr_2932"></span>[2933](#fn_2932.md) And
farther on: “Every one, therefore, who shall confess Me before men, him
will I also confess before My Father, Who is in heaven, but he who shall
deny Me before men, him will I also deny before My Father, Who is in
heaven.” <span id="fr_2933"></span>[2934](#fn_2933.md)

<span id="iv.vi.ii.iv-p5"></span>16. Where He says that He will confess,
He will confess “every one.” <span id="fr_2934"></span>[2935](#fn_2934.md)
Where He speaks of denying, He does not speak of denying “every one.”
For, whereas in the former clause He says, “Every one who shall confess
Me, him will I confess,” we should expect that in the following clause
He would also say, “Every one who shall deny Me.” But in order that He
might not appear to deny every one, He concludes: “But he who shall deny
Me before men, him will I also deny.” He promises favour to every one,
but He does not threaten the penalty to every one. He makes more of that
which is merciful. He makes less of what is penal.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.iv-p7"></span>17. And this is written not only in
that book of the Gospel of the Lord Jesus, which is written according to
Matthew, but it is also to be read in that which we have according to
Luke, <span id="fr_2935"></span>[2936](#fn_2935.md) that we might know that
neither had thus related the saying by chance.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.iv-p9"></span>18. We have said that it is thus
written. Let us now consider the meaning. “Every one,” He says, “who
shall confess Me,” that is to say, of whatever age, of whatever
condition he may be, who shall confess Me, he shall have Me as the
Rewarder of his confession. Whereas the expression is, “every one,” no
one who shall confess is excluded from the reward. But it is not said in
like manner, “Every one who shall deny shall be denied,” for it is
possible that a man overcome by torture may deny God in word, and yet
worship Him in his heart.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.iv-p10"></span>19. Is the case the same with him who
denies voluntarily, and with him whom torture, not his own will, has led
to denial? How unfit were it, since with men credit is given for
endurance in a struggle, that one should assert that it had no value
with God! For often in this world’s athletic contests the public crown
together with the victors even the vanquished whose conduct has been
approved, especially if perchance they have seen that they lost the
victory by some trick or fraud. And shall Christ suffer His athletes,
whom He has seen to yield for a moment to severe torments, to remain
without forgiveness?

<span id="iv.vi.ii.iv-p11"></span>20. Shall not He take account of their
toil, Who will not cast off for ever even those whom He casts off? For
David says: “God will not cast off for ever,” <span
id="fr_2936"></span>[2937](#fn_2936.md) and in opposition to this shall we
listen to heresy asserting, “He does cast off for ever”? David says:
“God will not for ever cut off His mercy from generation to generation,
nor will He forget to be merciful.” <span
id="fr_2937"></span>[2938](#fn_2937.md) This is the prophet’s declaration,
and there are those who would maintain a forgetfulness of mercy on God’s
part.

[Next: Chapter V. The objection from the unchangeableness of God is
answered from several passages of Scripture, wherein God promises
forgiveness to sinners on their repentance. St. Ambrose also shows that
mercy will be more readily accorded to such as have sinned, as it were,
against their will, which he illustrates by the case of prisoners taken
in war, and by language put into the mouth of the devil.](2100292.md)
