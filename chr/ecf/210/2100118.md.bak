### <span id="iv.ii.i-p0.1"></span>Introduction to the Three Books of St. Ambrose on the Holy Spirit.

<span id="iv.ii.i-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.ii.i-p1.1"></span>The</span> three books on the Holy Spirit are,
as St. Ambrose says himself, a sequel to those on the Faith, and the two
treatises together have been sometimes quoted as if one, with the title,
*De Trinitate*. But we see from Gratian’s letter to St. Ambrose, and
from the reply, that each treatise is separate, and the *De Spiritu
Sancto* was written some years later, <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.ii.i-p1.2"></span>a.d.</span> 381.

<span id="iv.ii.i-p2"></span>In the first book St. Ambrose commences by
allegorizing the history of Gideon and the fleece, seeing in the drying
of the fleece and the moistening of the threshing-floor a type of the
Holy Spirit leaving the Jews and being poured out on the Gentiles.
Passing to his more immediate subject, he proves that the Holy Spirit is
above the whole Creation and is truly God, alleging as a special
argument that the sin against the Holy Spirit can never be forgiven,
here or hereafter. He shows how the Holy Spirit is in Scripture called
the Spirit of God; that He spake by the prophets and apostles; that He
sanctifies men, and is typified by the mystical ointment spoken of in
Scripture. Next, St. Ambrose treats of His oneness with the other two
Persons of the Holy Trinity, and shows that His mission in no way
detracts from this oneness, but that there is in all the Divine Persons
a perfect unity of peace, love, and other virtues.

<span id="iv.ii.i-p3"></span>The second book commences with a treatment
of the history of Samson in the same way as that of Gideon in Book I.
Samson always succeeded so long as the Holy Spirit was with him, but
fell into misfortune so soon as he was forsaken. It is shown that the
power of the Holy Spirit is the same as that of the Father and the Son,
and that there is an agreement in design and working, and in vivifying
man. He is Creator and therefore to be worshipped, and He worked with
the Father and the Son in founding the Church, and in conclusion is
proved the unity of operation in the Three Persons.

<span id="iv.ii.i-p4"></span>The third book continues the same argument,
showing that the mission of prophets and apostles, and even of the Son
Himself, is to be referred to the Spirit, yet without any subjection on
the part of the Son, seeing that the Spirit also receives His mission
from the Father and the Son. The Godhead of the Holy Spirit is next
taken up and proved, when occasion is taken also to show that there are
not three Gods or three Lords, for the Three Divine Persons are one in
holiness and nature; and the work is concluded with a summary of some of
the principal arguments.

<span id="iv.ii.i-p5"></span>There can be but little doubt that this is
the work, and St. Ambrose the author, bitterly attacked by St. Jerome;
the whole passage may be read in the *Apology* of Rufinus, p. 470, in
vol. iii. of this series. St. Ambrose is compared to a daw decked in
another bird’s plumage, and charged with writing “bad things in Latin
taken from good things in Greek,” and St. Jerome even took the trouble
to translate a work of St. Didymus on the Holy Spirit (from the preface
to which the above extracts are taken), in order that those who did not
know Greek might, St. Jerome hoped, recognize the plagiarisms.

<span id="iv.ii.i-p6"></span>Rufinus vigorously defends St. Ambrose,
and, pointing out many inconsistencies in his opponent, says: “The
saintly Ambrose wrote his book on the Holy Spirit not in words only but
with his own blood, for he offered his life-blood to his persecutors,
and shed it within himself, though God preserved his life for future
labours.” <span id="fr_780"></span>[781](#fn_780.md)

<span id="iv.ii.i-p8"></span><span id="page_92">p. 92</span> <span
id="iv.ii.i-Page_92"></span>The truth is that St. Ambrose being a good
Greek scholar, and having undertaken to write on the Holy Spirit,
studied what others had written before him, and made use of what had
been urged by SS. Basil, Didymus, and others. The opinion of the great
St. Augustine concerning this treatise may be set against that of St.
Jerome. “St. Ambrose when treating of the deep subject of the Holy
Spirit, and showing that He is equal with the Father and the Son, yet
makes use of a simple style of discourse; inasmuch as his subject
required no the embellishments of language, but proofs to move the minds
of his readers.” <span id="fr_781"></span>[782](#fn_781.md)
