<span id="iv.ii.iii.vi"></span>

#### <span id="iv.ii.iii.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.vi-p1"></span>The Holy Spirit, as well as the Father
and the Son, is pointed out in holy Scripture as Creator, and the same
truth was shadowed forth even by heathen writers, but it was shown most
plainly in the Mystery of the Incarnation, after touching upon which,
the writer maintains his argument from the fact that worship which is
due to the Creator alone is paid to the Holy Spirit.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.vi-p2"></span>32. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.ii.iii.vi-p2.1"></span>But</span> who can doubt that the Holy
Spirit gives life to all things; since both He, as the Father and the
Son, is the Creator of all things; and the Almighty Father is understood
to have done nothing without the Holy Spirit; and since also in the
beginning of the creation the Spirit moved upon the water.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.vi-p3"></span>33. So when the Spirit was moving upon
the water, the creation was without grace; <span id="page_119">p.
119</span> <span id="iv.ii.iii.vi-Page_119"></span>but after this world
being created underwent the operation of the Spirit, it gained all the
beauty of that grace, wherewith the world is illuminated. And that the
grace of the universe cannot abide without the Holy Spirit the prophet
declared when he said: “Thou wilt take away Thy Spirit, and they will
fail and be turned again into their dust. Send forth Thy Spirit, and
they shall be made, and Thou wilt renew all the face of the
earth.” <span id="fr_1045"></span>[1046](#fn_1045.md) Not only, then, did
he teach that no creature can stand without the Holy Spirit, but also
that the Spirit is the Creator of the whole creation.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.vi-p5"></span>34. And who can deny that the creation
of the earth is the work of the Holy Spirit, Whose work it is that it is
renewed? For if they desire to deny that it was created by the Spirit,
since they cannot deny that it must be renewed by the Spirit, they who
desire to sever the Persons must maintain that the operation of the Holy
Spirit is superior to that of the Father and the Son, which is far from
the truth; for there is no doubt that the restored earth is better than
it was created. Or if at first, without the operation of the Holy
Spirit, the Father and the Son made the earth, but the operation of the
Holy Spirit was joined on afterwards, it will seem that that which was
made required His aid, which was then added. But far be it from any one
to think this, namely, that the divine work should be believed to have a
change in the Creator, an error brought in by Manicheus. <span
id="fr_1046"></span>[1047](#fn_1046.md)

<span id="iv.ii.iii.vi-p7"></span>35. But do we suppose that the
substance of the earth exists without the operation of the Holy Spirit,
without Whose work not even the expanse of the sky endures? For it is
written: “By the Word of the Lord were the heavens established, and all
the strength of them by the Spirit of His Mouth.” <span
id="fr_1047"></span>[1048](#fn_1047.md) Observe what he says, that all the
strength of the heavens is to be referred to the Spirit. For how should
He Who was moving <span id="fr_1048"></span>[1049](#fn_1048.md) before the
earth was made, be resting when it was being made?

<span id="iv.ii.iii.vi-p10"></span>36. Gentile writers, following ours
as it were through shadows, because they could not imbibe the truth of
the Spirit, have pointed out in their verses that the Spirit within
nourishes heaven and earth, and the glittering orbs of moon and
stars. <span id="fr_1049"></span>[1050](#fn_1049.md) So they deny not that
the strength of creatures exists through the Spirit, are we who read
this to deny it? But you think that they refer to a Spirit produced of
the air. If they declared a Spirit of the air to be the Author of all
things, do we doubt that the Spirit of God is the Creator of all things?

<span id="iv.ii.iii.vi-p12"></span>37. But why do I delay with matters
not to the purpose? Let them accept a plain proof that there can be
nothing which the Holy Spirit can be said not to have made; and that it
cannot be doubted that all subsists through His operation, whether
Angels, Archangels, Thrones, or Dominions; since the Lord Himself, Whom
the Angels serve, was begotten by the Holy Spirit coming upon the
Virgin, as, according to Matthew, the Angel said to Joseph: “Joseph,
thou son of David, fear not to take Mary thy wife, for that which shall
be born of her is of the Holy Spirit.” <span
id="fr_1050"></span>[1051](#fn_1050.md) And according to Luke, he said to
Mary: “The Holy Spirit shall come upon thee.” <span
id="fr_1051"></span>[1052](#fn_1051.md)

<span id="iv.ii.iii.vi-p15"></span>38. The birth from the Virgin was,
then, the work of the Spirit. The fruit of the womb is the work of the
Spirit, according to that which is written: “Blessed art thou among
women, and blessed is the Fruit of thy womb.” <span
id="fr_1052"></span>[1053](#fn_1052.md) The flower from the root is the
work of the Spirit, that flower, I say, of which it was well prophesied:
“A rod shall go forth from the root of Jesse, and a flower shall rise
from his root.” <span id="fr_1053"></span>[1054](#fn_1053.md) The root of
Jesse the patriarch is the family of the Jews, Mary is the rod, Christ
the flower of Mary, Who, about to spread the good odour of faith
throughout the whole world, budded forth from a virgin womb, as He
Himself said: “I am the flower of the plain, a lily of the
valley.” <span id="fr_1054"></span>[1055](#fn_1054.md)

<span id="iv.ii.iii.vi-p19"></span>39. The flower, when cut, keeps its
odour, and when bruised increases it, nor if torn off does it lose it;
so, too, the Lord Jesus, on the gibbet of the cross, neither failed when
bruised, nor fainted when torn; and when He was cut by that piercing of
the spear, being made more beautiful by the colour of the outpoured
Blood, He, as it were, grew comely again, not able in Himself to die,
and breathing forth upon the dead the gift of eternal life. On this
flower, then, of the royal rod the Holy Spirit rested.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.vi-p20"></span>40. A good rod, as some think, is the
Flesh of the Lord, which, raising itself from its earthly root to
heaven, bore around the whole world the sweet-smelling fruits of
religion, the mysteries of the divine generation, pouring grace on the
altars of heaven.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.vi-p21"></span><span id="page_120">p. 120</span>
<span id="iv.ii.iii.vi-Page_120"></span>41. So, then, we cannot doubt
that the Spirit is Creator, Whom we know as the Author of the Lord’s
Incarnation. For who can doubt when you find in the commencement of the
Gospel that the generation of Jesus Christ was on this wise: “When Mary
was espoused to Joseph, before they came together she was found with
child of \[*ex*\] the Holy Spirit.” <span
id="fr_1055"></span>[1056](#fn_1055.md)

<span id="iv.ii.iii.vi-p23"></span>42. For although most authorities
read “de Spiritu,” yet the Greek from which the Latins translated have
“<span class="Greek"><span id="iv.ii.iii.vi-p23.1"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.ii.iii.vi-p23.2"></span>χ πνεύματος
ἁγίου</span>,” that is, “*ex Spiritu Sancto*.” For that which is “of”
\[*ex*\] any one is either of his substance or of his power. Of his
substance, as the Son, Who says: “I came forth of the Mouth of the Most
High;” <span id="fr_1056"></span>[1057](#fn_1056.md) as the Spirit, “Who
proceedeth from the Father;” <span id="fr_1057"></span>[1058](#fn_1057.md)
of Whom the Son says: “He shall glorify Me, for He shall receive of
Mine.” <span id="fr_1058"></span>[1059](#fn_1058.md) But of the power, as
in the passage: “One God the Father, of Whom are all things.” <span
id="fr_1059"></span>[1060](#fn_1059.md)

<span id="iv.ii.iii.vi-p28"></span>43. How, then, was Mary with child of
the Holy Spirit? If as of her substance, was the Spirit, then, changed
into flesh and bones? Certainly not. But if the Virgin conceived as of
His operation and power, who can deny that the Holy Spirit is Creator?

<span id="iv.ii.iii.vi-p29"></span>44. How is it, too, that Job plainly
set forth the Spirit as his Creator, saying: “The Spirit of God hath
made me”? <span id="fr_1060"></span>[1061](#fn_1060.md) In one short verse
he showed Him to be both Divine and Creator. If, then, the Spirit is
Creator, He is certainly not a creature, for the Apostle has separated
the Creator and the creature, saying: “They served the creature rather
than the Creator.” <span id="fr_1061"></span>[1062](#fn_1061.md)

<span id="iv.ii.iii.vi-p32"></span>45. He teaches that the Creator is to
be served by condemning those who serve the creature, whereas we owe our
service to the Creator. And since he knew the Spirit to be the Creator,
he teaches that we ought to serve Him, saying: “Beware of the dogs,
beware of the evil workers, beware of the concision, for we are the
circumcision who serve the Spirit of God.” <span
id="fr_1062"></span>[1063](#fn_1062.md)

<span id="iv.ii.iii.vi-p34"></span>46. But if any one disputes because
of the variations of the Latin codices, some of which heretics have
falsified, let him look at the Greek codices, and observe that it is
there written: “<span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.ii.iii.vi-p34.1"></span>οἱ πνεύματι Θεοῦ λατρεύοντες</span>,”
which is, being translated, “who serve the Spirit of God.”

<span id="iv.ii.iii.vi-p35"></span>47. So, then, when the same Apostle
says that we ought to serve the Spirit, who asserts that we must not
serve the creature, but the Creator; without doubt he plainly shows that
the Holy Spirit is Creator, and is to be venerated with the honour due
to the eternal Godhead; for it is written: “Thou shalt worship the Lord
thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve.” <span

id="iv.ii.iii.vi-p27.1"></span>. The argument from the exact force of
prepositions is often urged by the Fathers, as by St. Athanasius and St.
Basil among the Greeks. The Latins also use it, as St. Ambrose here, but
occasionally the same Greek prepositions are variously rendered, which
destroys the force of the argument. With regard to the two prepositions
*ex* and *de* St. Augustine gives a very good explanation, *De Natura
Bon,* c. 27: “*Ex ipso* \[of Him\] does not always mean the same as *de
ipso* \[from Him\]. That which is from Him can be said to be of Him, but
not everything which is of Him is rightly said to be from Him. Of Him
are the heavens and the earth, for He made them, but not from Him,
because not of His substance.” But neither the Vulgate nor even St.
Ambrose himself is quite consistent in this matter.

[Next: Chapter VI. To those who object that according to the words of
Amos the Spirit is created, the answer is made that the word is there
understood of the wind, which is often created, which cannot be said of
the Holy Spirit, since He is eternal, and cannot be dissolved in death,
or by an heretical absorption into the Father. But if they
pertinaciously contend that this passage was written of the Holy Spirit,
St. Ambrose points out that recourse must be had to a spiritual
Interpretation, for Christ by His coming established the thunder, that
is, the force of the divine utterances, and by Spirit is signified the
human soul as also the flesh assumed by Christ. And since this was
created by each Person of the Trinity, it is thence argued that the
Spirit, Who has before been affirmed to be the Creator of all things,
was the Author of the Incarnation of the Lord.](2100144.md)
