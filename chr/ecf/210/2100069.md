<span id="iv.i.iii.vi"></span>

#### <span id="iv.i.iii.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.

<span id="iv.i.iii.vi-p1"></span>On what is useful: not that which is
advantageous, but that which is just and virtuous. It is to be found in
losses, and is divided into what is useful for the body, and what is
useful unto godliness.

<span id="iv.i.iii.vi-p2"></span>22. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.iii.vi-p2.1"></span>In</span> the first book we made our
division in such a way as to set in the first place what is virtuous and
what is seemly; for all duties are derived from these. In the second
place we set what is useful. But as at the start we said that there was
a difference between what is virtuous and what is seemly—which one can
comprehend more easily than one can explain—so also when we are thinking
of what is useful, we have to give considerable thought to what is the
more useful. <span id="fr_412"></span>[413](#fn_412)

<span id="iv.i.iii.vi-p4"></span>23. But we do not reckon usefulness by
the value of any gain in money, but in acquiring godliness, as the
Apostle says: “But godliness is profitable unto all things, having
promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.” <span
id="fr_413"></span>[414](#fn_413) Thus in the holy Scriptures, if we
look carefully we shall often find that what is virtuous is called
useful: “All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not
profitable” \[useful\]. <span id="fr_414"></span>[415](#fn_414) Before
that he was speaking of vices, and so means: It is lawful to sin, but it
is not seemly. Sins rest in one’s own power, but they are not virtuous.
To live wantonly is easy, but it is not right. For food serves not God
but the belly.

<span id="iv.i.iii.vi-p7"></span>24. Therefore, because what is useful
is also just, it is just to serve Christ, Who redeemed us. They too are
just who for His Name’s sake have given themselves up to death, they are
unjust who have avoided it. Of them it says: What profit is there in my
blood? <span id="fr_415"></span>[416](#fn_415) that is: what advance has
my justice made? Wherefore they also say: “Let us bind the just, for he
is useless to us,” <span id="fr_416"></span>[417](#fn_416) that is: he
is unjust, for he complains of us, condemns and rebukes us. This could
also be referred to the greed of impious men, which closely resembles
treachery; as we read in the case of the traitor Judas, who in his
longing for gain and his desire for money put his head into the noose of
treachery and fell.

<span id="iv.i.iii.vi-p10"></span>25. We have then to speak of that
usefulness which is full of what is virtuous, as the Apostle himself has
laid it down in so many words, saying: “And this I speak for your own
profit, not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is
comely.” <span id="fr_417"></span>[418](#fn_417) It is plain, then, that
what is virtuous is useful, and what is useful is virtuous; also that
what is useful is just, and what is just is useful. I can say this, for
I am speaking, not to merchants who are covetous from a desire to make
gain, but to my children. And I am speaking of the duties which I wish
to impress upon and impart to you, whom I have chosen for the service of
the Lord; so that those things which have been already implanted and
fixed in your minds and characters by habit and training may now be
further unfolded to you by explanation and instruction.

<span id="iv.i.iii.vi-p12"></span>26. Therefore as I am about to speak
of what is useful, I will take up those words of <span id="page_48">p.
48</span> <span id="iv.i.iii.vi-Page_48"></span>the Prophet: “Incline my
heart unto Thy testimonies and not to covetousness,” <span
id="fr_418"></span>[419](#fn_418) that the sound of the word “useful”
may not rouse in us the desire for money. Some indeed put it thus:
“Incline my heart unto Thy testimonies and not to what is useful,” that
is, that kind of usefulness which is always on the watch for making
gains in business, and has been bent and diverted by the habits of men
to the pursuit of money. For as a rule most people call that only useful
which is profitable, but we are speaking of that kind of usefulness
which is sought in earthly loss “that we may gain Christ,” <span
id="fr_419"></span>[420](#fn_419) whose gain is “godliness with
contentment.” <span id="fr_420"></span>[421](#fn_420) Great, too, is the
gain whereby we attain to godliness, which is rich with God, not indeed
in fleeting wealth, but in eternal gifts, and in which rests no
uncertain trial but grace constant and unending.

<span id="iv.i.iii.vi-p16"></span>27. There is therefore a usefulness
connected with the body, and also one that has to do with godliness,
according to the Apostle’s division: “Bodily exercise profiteth a
little, but godliness is profitable unto all things.” <span
id="fr_421"></span>[422](#fn_421) And what is so virtuous as integrity?
what so seemly as to preserve the body unspotted and undefiled, and its
purity unsullied? What, again, is so seemly as that a widow should keep
her plighted troth to her dead husband? What more useful than this
whereby the heavenly kingdom is attained? For “there are some who have
made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven’s sake.” <span
id="fr_422"></span>[423](#fn_422)

[Next: Chapter VII. What is useful is the same as what is virtuous;
nothing is more useful than love, which is gained by gentleness,
courtesy, kindness, justice, and the other virtues, as we are given to
understand from the histories of Moses and David. Lastly, confidence
springs from love, and again love from confidence.](2100070)
