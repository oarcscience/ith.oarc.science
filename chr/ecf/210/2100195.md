#### <span id="iv.iv.iii.xiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XII.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xiii-p1"></span>Further objections to the Godhead of
the Son are met by the same answer—to wit, that they may equally be
urged against the Father also. The Father, then, being in no way
confined by time, place, or anything else created, no such limitation is
to be imposed upon the Son, Whose marvellous generation is not only of
the Father, but of the Virgin also, and therefore, since in His
generation of the Father no distinction of sex, or the like, was
involved, neither was it in His generation of the Virgin.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xiii-p2"></span>74. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.iii.xiii-p2.1"></span>The</span> next objection is this: “If
the Son has not those properties which all sons have, He is no Son.” May
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit pardon me, for I would propound the
question in all devoutness. Surely the Father is, and abides for ever:
created things, too, are as God hath ordained them. Is there any one,
then, amongst these creatures which is not subject to the limitations of
place, time, or the fact of having been created, or to some originating
cause or creator. <span id="fr_1811"></span>[1812](#fn_1811.md) Surely,
none. What, then? Is there any one of them whereof the Father stands in
need? So to say were blasphemy. Cease, then, to apply to the Godhead
what is proper only to created existences, or, if you insist upon
forcing the comparison, bethink you whither your wickedness leads. God
forbid that we should even behold the end thereof.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xiii-p4"></span><span id="page_214">p. 214</span>
<span id="iv.iv.iii.xiii-Page_214"></span>75. We maintain the answer
given by piety. God is Almighty, and therefore God the Father needs none
of those things, for in Him there is no changing, nor any place for such
help as we need, we whose weakness is supported by means of things of
this kind. But He Who is Almighty, plainly He is uncreate, and not
confined to any place, and surpasses time. Before God was not
anything—nay, even to speak about anything being before God is a grave
sin. If, then, you grant that in the nature of God the Father there is
nought that implies a being sustained, because He is God, it follows
that nothing of this sort can be supposed to exist in the Son of God,
nothing that connotes a beginning, or growth, forasmuch as He is “very
God of very God.” <span id="fr_1812"></span>[1813](#fn_1812.md)

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xiii-p6"></span>76. Seeing, then, that we find not
the customary order prevailing, be content, Arian, to believe in a
miraculous generation of the Son. Be content, I say, and if you believe
me not, at least have respect unto the voice of God saying, “To whom
have ye esteemed Me to be like?” <span
id="fr_1813"></span>[1814](#fn_1813.md) and again: “God is not like a man
that He should repent.” <span id="fr_1814"></span>[1815](#fn_1814.md) If,
indeed, God works mysteriously, seeing that He doth not work any work,
or fashion anything, or bring it to completion, by labor of hands, or in
any course of days, “for He spake, and they were made; He gave the word
and they were created,” <span id="fr_1815"></span>[1816](#fn_1815.md) why
should we not believe that He Whom we acknowledge as a Creator,
mysteriously working, discerning it in His works, also begat His Son in
a mysterious manner? Surely it is fitting that He should be regarded as
having begotten the Son in a special and mysterious way. Let Him Who
hath the grace of majesty unrivalled likewise have the glory of
mysterious generation.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xiii-p10"></span>77. Not only Christ’s generation of
the Father, but His birth also of the Virgin, demands our wonder. You
say that the former is like unto the manner wherein we men are
conceived. I will show—nay more, I will compel you yourself to confess,
that the latter also hath no likeness to the manner of our birth. Tell
me how it was that He was born of Mary, with what law did His conception
in a Virgin’s womb agree, how there could be any birth without the seed
of a man, how a maiden could become great with child, how she became a
mother before experience of such intercourse as is between wives and
husbands. There was no \[visible\] cause,—and yet a son was begotten.
How, then, came about this birth, under a new law?

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xiii-p11"></span>78. If, then, the common order of
human generation was not found in the case of the Virgin Mary, how can
you demand that God the Father should beget in such wise as you were
begotten in? Surely the common order is determined by difference of sex;
for this is implanted in the nature of our flesh, but where flesh is
not, how can you expect to find the infirmity of flesh? No man calls in
question one who is better than he is: to believe is enjoined upon you,
without permission to question. For it is written, “Abraham believed
God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.” <span
id="fr_1816"></span>[1817](#fn_1816.md) Language is vain to set forth, not
only the generation of the Son, but even the works of God, for it is
written: “All His works are executed in faithfulness;” <span
id="fr_1817"></span>[1818](#fn_1817.md) His works, then, are done in
faithfulness, but not His generation? Ay, we call in question that which
we see not, we who are bidden to believe rather than enquire of that we
see.

[Next: Chapter XIII. Discussion of the Divine Generation is continued.
St. Ambrose illustrates its method by the same example as that employed
by the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews. The duty of believing what
is revealed is shown by the example of Nebuchadnezzar and St. Peter. By
the vision granted to St. Peter was shown the Son's Eternity and
Godhead--the Apostle, then, must be believed in preference to the
teachers of philosophy, whose authority was everywhere falling into
discredit. The Arians, on the other hand, are shown to be like unto the
heathen.](2100196.md)
