<span id="iv.iv.iv.vii"></span>

#### <span id="iv.iv.iv.vii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.vii-p1"></span>The passages of Scripture above cited
are taken as an occasion for a digression, wherein our Lord’s freedom of
action is proved from the ascription to the Spirit of such freedom, and
from places where it is attributed to the Son.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.vii-p2"></span>47. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.iv.vii-p2.1"></span>Let</span> us now, for the present,
explain more fully why our Lord said, “If it be possible,” and so call a
truce, as it were, while we show that He possessed freedom of will. Ye
deny—so far are ye gone in the way of iniquity—that the Son of God had a
free will. Moreover, it is your wont to detract from the Holy Spirit,
though you cannot deny that it is written: “The Spirit doth breathe,
where He will.” <span id="fr_1961"></span>[1962](#fn_1961.md) “Where He
will,” saith the Scripture, not “where He is ordered.” If, then, the
Spirit doth breathe where He will, cannot the Son do what He will? Why,
it is the very same Son of God Who in His Gospel saith that the Spirit
has power to breathe where He will. Doth the Son, therefore, confess the
Spirit to be greater, in that He has power to do what is not permitted
to Himself?

<span id="iv.iv.iv.vii-p4"></span>48. The Apostle also saith that “all
is the work of one and the same Spirit, distributing to each according
to His will.” <span id="fr_1962"></span>[1963](#fn_1962.md) “According to
His will,” mark you—that is, according to the judgment of a free will,
not in obedience to compulsion. Furthermore, the gifts distributed by
the Spirit are no mean gifts, but such works as God is wont to do,—the
gift of healing and of working deeds of power. While the Spirit, then,
distributes as He will, the Son of God cannot set free whom He will. But
hear Him speak when He does even as He will: “I have willed to do Thy
will, O my God;” <span id="fr_1963"></span>[1964](#fn_1963.md) and again:
“I will offer Thee a freewill offering.” <span
id="fr_1964"></span>[1965](#fn_1964.md)

<span id="iv.iv.iv.vii-p8"></span>49. The holy Apostle later knew that
Jesus had it in His power to do as He would, and therefore, seeing Him
walk upon the sea, said: “Lord, if it be Thou, bid me come to Thee over
the waters.” <span id="fr_1965"></span>[1966](#fn_1965.md) Peter believed
that if Christ commanded, the natural conditions could be changed, so
that water might support human footsteps, and things discrepant be
reduced to harmony and agreement. Peter asks of Christ to command, not
to request: Christ requested not, but commanded, and it was done—and
Arius denies it!

<span id="iv.iv.iv.vii-p10"></span>50. What indeed is there that the
Father will have, but the Son will not, or that the Son will have, but
the Father will not? “The Father quickeneth whom He will,” and the Son
quickeneth whom He will, even as it is written. <span
id="fr_1966"></span>[1967](#fn_1966.md) Tell me now whom the Son hath
quickened, and the Father would not quicken. Since, however, the Son
quickeneth whom He will, and the action \[of Father and Son\] is one,
you see that not only doeth the Son the Father’s will, but the Father
also doeth the Son’s. For what is quickening but quickening through the
passion of Christ? But the passion of Christ is the Father’s will. Whom,
therefore, the Son quickeneth, He quickeneth by the will of the Father;
therefore their will is one.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.vii-p12"></span>51. Again, what was the will of the
Father, but that Jesus should come into the world <span id="page_230">p.
230</span> <span id="iv.iv.iv.vii-Page_230"></span>and cleanse us from
our sins? Hear the words of the leper: “If Thou wilt, Thou canst make me
clean.” <span id="fr_1967"></span>[1968](#fn_1967.md) Christ answered, “I
will,” and straightway health, the effect, followed. See you not that
the Son is master of His own will, and Christ’s will is the same as the
Father’s. Indeed, seeing that He hath said, “All things that the Father
hath are Mine,” <span id="fr_1968"></span>[1969](#fn_1968.md) nothing of a
certainty being excepted, the Son hath the same will that the Father
hath.

The same word in Greek at least, serves to denote “wind” and
“spirit”—the invisible and yet sensible and real air, wind, or breath
being taken as the best emblem of the spirit, which is known and its
presence realized only by its effects. *Spiritus,* “spirit,” primarily
means “breath.”

[Next: Chapter VII. The resolution of the difficulty set forth for
consideration is again taken in hand. Christ truly and really took upon
Him a human will and affections, the source of whatsoever was not in
agreement with His Godhead, and which must be therefore referred to the
fact that He was at the same time both God and man.](2100212.md)
