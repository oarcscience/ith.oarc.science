<span id="iv.iv.v.xii"></span>

#### <span id="iv.iv.v.xii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XII.

<span id="iv.iv.v.xii-p1"></span>The kingdom of the Father and of the
Son is one and undivided, so likewise is the Godhead of each.

<span id="iv.iv.v.xii-p2"></span>92. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.v.xii-p2.1"></span>I would</span> now ask how they suppose the
kingdom of the Father and the Son to be divided, when the Lord hath
said, as we showed above: “Every kingdom divided against itself shall be
speedily overthrown.” <span id="fr_2265"></span>[2266](#fn_2265.md)

<span id="iv.iv.v.xii-p4"></span><span id="page_256">p. 256</span> <span
id="iv.iv.v.xii-Page_256"></span>93. Indeed, it was to debar the impious
teaching of Arian enmity that Saint Peter himself asserted the dominion
of the Father and the Son to be one, saying: “Wherefore, my brethren,
labour to make your calling and election sure, for so doing you shall
not go astray, for thus your entrance into the eternal realm of God and
our Lord and Saviour <span id="fr_2266"></span>[2267](#fn_2266.md) Jesus
Christ shall be granted with the greater abundance of grace.” <span
id="fr_2267"></span>[2268](#fn_2267.md)

<span id="iv.iv.v.xii-p7"></span>94. Now, if it be thought that Christ’s
dominion alone is spoken of, and the place be therefore understood in
such sense that the Father and the Son are regarded as divided in
authority—yet it will be still acknowledged that it is the dominion of
the Son, and that an eternal one, and thus not only will two kingdoms,
separate, and so liable to fail, be brought in, but, furthermore,
inasmuch as no kingdom is to be compared with God’s kingdom, which they
cannot, however greatly they may desire to, deny to be the kingdom of
the Son, they must either turn back upon their opinion, and acknowledge
the kingdom of the Father and the Son to be one and the same; or they
must ascribe to the Father the government of a lesser kingdom—which is
blasphemy; or they must acknowledge Him, Whom they wickedly declare to
be inferior in respect of Godhead, to possess an equal kingdom, which is
inconsistent.

<span id="iv.iv.v.xii-p8"></span>95. But this \[their teaching\] squares
not, agrees not, holds not \[with its premisses\]. Let them confess,
then, that the kingdom is one, even as we confess and prove, not indeed
on our own evidence, but upon testimony vouchsafed from heaven.

<span id="iv.iv.v.xii-p9"></span>96. To begin with, learn, from further
testimonies \[of Scripture\], how that the kingdom of heaven is also the
kingdom of the Son: “Verily, verily, I say unto you, that there are some
amongst those which stand here with us, who shall not taste death, until
they see the Son of Man coming into His kingdom.” <span
id="fr_2268"></span>[2269](#fn_2268.md) There is therefore no room for
doubt that the kingdom appertaineth to the Son of God.

<span id="iv.iv.v.xii-p11"></span>97. Now learn that the kingdom of the
Son is the very same as the kingdom of the Father: “Verily, I say unto
you that there be some of those which stand around us, who shall not
taste death until they see the kingdom of God coming in power.” <span
id="fr_2269"></span>[2270](#fn_2269.md) So far, indeed, is it one kingdom,
that the reward is one, the inheritor is one and the same, and so also
the merit, and He Who promises \[the reward\].

<span id="iv.iv.v.xii-p13"></span>98. How can it but be one kingdom,
above all when the Son Himself hath said of Himself: “Then shall the
righteous shine like the sun in the kingdom of My Father”? <span
id="fr_2270"></span>[2271](#fn_2270.md) For that which is the Father’s, by
fitness to His majesty, is also the Son’s, by unity in the same
glory. <span id="fr_2271"></span>[2272](#fn_2271.md) The Scripture,
therefore, hath declared the kingdom to be the kingdom both of the
Father and of the Son.

<span id="iv.iv.v.xii-p16"></span>99. Now learn that where the kingdom
of God is named, there is no putting aside of the authority either of
the Father or of the Son, because both the kingdom of the Father and the
kingdom of the Son is included under the single name of God, saying:
“When ye shall see Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in
the kingdom of God.” <span id="fr_2272"></span>[2273](#fn_2272.md) Do we
deny that the prophets are in the kingdom of the Son, when even to a
dying robber who said, “Remember me, when Thou comest into Thy kingdom,”
the Lord made answer: “Verily, I say unto thee, to-day shalt thou be
with Me in paradise.” <span id="fr_2273"></span>[2274](#fn_2273.md) What,
indeed, do we understand by being in the kingdom of God, if not the
having escaped eternal death? But they who have escaped eternal death
see the Son of Man coming into His kingdom.

<span id="iv.iv.v.xii-p19"></span>100. How, then, can He not have in His
power that which He gives, saying: “To thee will I give the keys of the
kingdom of heaven”? <span id="fr_2274"></span>[2275](#fn_2274.md) See the
gulf between \[the one and the other\]. The servant opens, the Lord
bestows; the One through Himself, the other through Christ; the minister
receives the keys, the Lord appoints powers: the one is the right of a
giver, the other the duty of a steward.

<span id="iv.iv.v.xii-p21"></span>101. See now yet another proof that
the kingdom, the government, of the Father and the Son is one. It is
written in the Epistle to Timothy: “Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ,
according to the government of God, our Saviour, and Christ Jesus, our
Hope.” <span id="fr_2275"></span>[2276](#fn_2275.md) One, therefore, the
kingdom of the Father and the Son is plainly declared to be, even as
Paul the Apostle also asserted, saying: “For know this, that no
shameless person, none that is impure, or covetous (which meaneth
idolatry), hath inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.” <span
id="fr_2276"></span>[2277](#fn_2276.md) It is, therefore, one kingdom, one
Godhead.

<span id="iv.iv.v.xii-p24"></span><span id="page_257">p. 257</span>
<span id="iv.iv.v.xii-Page_257"></span>102. Oneness in Godhead the Law
hath proved, which speaks of one God, <span
id="fr_2277"></span>[2278](#fn_2277.md) as also the Apostle, by saying of
Christ; “In Whom dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.” <span
id="fr_2278"></span>[2279](#fn_2278.md) For if, as the Apostle saith, all
the fulness of the Godhead, bodily, is in Christ, then must the Father
and the Son be confessed to be of one Godhead; or if it is desired to
sunder the Godhead of the Son from the Godhead of the Father, whilst the
Son possesses all the fulness of the Godhead bodily, what is supposed to
be further reserved, seeing that nothing remains over and above the
fulness of perfection? Therefore the Godhead is one.
