#### <span id="iv.iv.v.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.

<span id="iv.iv.v.vi-p1"></span>In order to dispose of an objection
grounded on a text in St. John, St. Ambrose first shows that the Arian
interpretation lends countenance to the Manichæans; then, after setting
forth the different ways of dividing the words in this same passage, he
shows plainly that it cannot, without dishonour to the Father, be
understood with such reference to the Godhead as the Arians give it, and
expounds the true meaning thereon.

<span id="iv.iv.v.vi-p2"></span>41. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.v.vi-p2.1"></span>We</span> have no reason, therefore, to fear
the argument which the Arians, in their reckless manner of expounding,
use to construct, showing that the Word of God was “made,” for, say
they, it is written: “That which has been made in Him is life.” <span
id="fr_2182"></span>[2183](#fn_2182.md)

<span id="iv.iv.v.vi-p4"></span>42. First of all, let them understand
that if they make the words “That which has been made” to refer to the
Godhead, they entangle themselves in the difficulties raised by the
Manichæans, for these people argue: “If that which has been made in Him
is life, then there is something which has not been made in Him, and is
death,” so that they may impiously bring in two principles. But this
teaching the Church condemns.

<span id="iv.iv.v.vi-p5"></span>43. Again, how can the Arians prove that
the Evangelist actually said this? The most part of those who are
learned in the Faith read the passage as follows: “All things were made
by Him, and without Him was not anything made that has been made.”
Others read thus: “All things were made by Him, and without Him was
nothing made.” Then they proceed: “What has been made,” and to this they
join the words “in Him;” that is to say, “But whatsover is has been made
in Him.” But what mean the words “in Him”? The Apostle tells us, when he
says: “In Him we have our being, and live, and move.” <span
id="fr_2183"></span>[2184](#fn_2183.md)

<span id="iv.iv.v.vi-p7"></span>44. Howbeit, let them read the passage
as they will, they cannot diminish the majesty of God the Word, in
referring to His Person, <span id="fr_2184"></span>[2185](#fn_2184.md) as
subject, the words “That which was made,” <span
id="fr_2185"></span>[2186](#fn_2185.md) without also doing dishonour to God
the Father, of Whom it is written: “But he who doeth the truth cometh to
the light, that his works may be made manifest that they are wrought in
<span id="page_249">p. 249</span> <span
id="iv.iv.v.vi-Page_249"></span>God.” <span
id="fr_2186"></span>[2187](#fn_2186.md) See then—here we read of man’s
works being wrought in God, and yet for all that we cannot understand
the Godhead as the subject of them. We must either recognize the works
as wrought through Him, as the Apostle’s affirmation showeth that “all
things are through Him, and were created in Him, and He is before all,
and all things *exist together* in Him,” <span
id="fr_2187"></span>[2188](#fn_2187.md) or, as the witness of the text here
cited teaches us, we ought to regard the virtues whereby the fruit of
life eternal is gained, as wrought in God—chastity, piety, devoutness,
faith, and others of this kind, whereby the will of God is
expressed. <span id="fr_2188"></span>[2189](#fn_2188.md)

<span id="iv.iv.v.vi-p13"></span>45. Just as the works, then, are the
expression of the will and power of God the Father, so are they of
Christ’s, even as we read: “Created in Christ in good works;” <span
id="fr_2189"></span>[2190](#fn_2189.md) and in the psalm: “Peace be made in
Thy power;” <span id="fr_2190"></span>[2191](#fn_2190.md) and again: “In
wisdom hast Thou made them all.” <span
id="fr_2191"></span>[2192](#fn_2191.md) “In wisdom hast Thou made,” mark
you—not “Thou hast made wisdom;” for since all things have been made in
wisdom, and Christ is the Wisdom of God, then this Wisdom is plainly not
an accident, but a substance, and an everlasting one, but if the Wisdom
hath been made, then is it made in a worse condition than all things,
forasmuch as it could not, by itself, be made Wisdom. If, then, being
made is oftentimes referred to something accidental, not to the essence
of a thing, so may creation also be referred to some end had in
view. <span id="fr_2192"></span>[2193](#fn_2192.md)

appointed for a certain purpose, as when men were “created” consuls,
which did not mean that before the convening of the centuries they were
absolutely non-existent.

[Next: Chapter VII. Solomon's words, “The Lord created Me,” etc., mean
that Christ's Incarnation was done for the redemption of the Father's
creation, as is shown by the Son's own words. That He is the “beginning”
may be understood from the visible proofs of His virtuousness, and it is
shown how the Lord opened the ways of all virtues, and was their true
beginning.](2100229.md)
