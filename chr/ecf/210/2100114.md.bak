#### <span id="iv.i.iv.xx-p0.1"></span>Chapter XX.

<span id="iv.i.iv.xx-p1"></span>After the terrible siege of Samaria was
ended in accordance with Elisha’s prophecy, he relates what regard the
four lepers showed for what was virtuous.

<span id="iv.i.iv.xx-p2"></span>117. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.iv.xx-p2.1"></span>Why</span> need we wonder that the people of
the Lord had regard for what was seemly and virtuous when even the
lepers—as we read in the books of the Kings—showed concern for what is
virtuous?

<span id="iv.i.iv.xx-p3"></span>118. There was a great famine in
Samaria, <span id="fr_740"></span>[741](#fn_740.md) for the army of the
Syrians was besieging it. The king in his anxiety was making the round
of the guards on the walls when a woman addressed him, saying: This
woman persuaded me to give up my son—and I gave him up, and we boiled
him and did eat him. And she promised that she would afterwards bring
her son and that we should eat his flesh together, but now she hath
hidden her son and will not bring him. The king was troubled because
these women seemed to have fed not merely on human bodies, but on the
bodies of their own children; and being moved by an example of such
awful misery, threatened the prophet Elisha with death. For he believed
it was in his power to break up the siege and to avert the famine; or
else he was angry because the prophet had not allowed the king to smite
the Syrians whom he had struck with blindness. <span
id="fr_741"></span>[742](#fn_741.md)

<span id="iv.i.iv.xx-p6"></span>119. Elisha sat <span
id="fr_742"></span>[743](#fn_742.md) with the elders at Bethel, and before
the king’s messenger came to him he said to the elders: “See ye how the
son of that murderess hath sent to take away mine head?” Then the
messenger <span id="page_87">p. 87</span> <span
id="iv.i.iv.xx-Page_87"></span>entered and brought the king’s command
threatening instant danger to his life. Him the prophet answered: <span
id="fr_743"></span>[744](#fn_743.md) “To-morrow about this time shall a
measure of fine flour be sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley
for a shekel in the gate of Samaria.” Then when the messenger sent by
the king would not believe it, saying: “If the Lord would rain abundance
of corn from heaven, not even so would that come about,” Elisha said to
him: “Because thou hast not believed, thou shalt see it with thine eyes,
but shall not eat of it.”

<span id="iv.i.iv.xx-p9"></span>120. And suddenly <span
id="fr_744"></span>[745](#fn_744.md) in the camp of Syria was there heard,
as it were, a sound of chariots and a loud noise of horses and the noise
of a great host, and the tumult of some vast battle. And the Syrians
thought that the king of Israel had called to his help in the battle the
king of Egypt and the king of the Amorites, and they fled at dawn
leaving their tents, for they feared that they might be crushed by the
sudden arrival of fresh foes, and would not be able to withstand the
united forces of the kings. This was unknown in Samaria, for they dared
not go out of the town, being overcome with fear and also being weak
through hunger.

<span id="iv.i.iv.xx-p11"></span>121. But there were four lepers <span
id="fr_745"></span>[746](#fn_745.md) at the gate of the city to whom life
was a misery, and to die would be gain. And they said one to another:
“Behold we sit here and die. If we enter into the city, we shall die
with hunger; if we remain here, there are no means of living at hand for
us. Let us go to the Syrian camp, either they will quickly kill us or
grant us the means of safety.” So they went and entered into the camp,
and behold, all was forsaken by the enemy. Entering <span
id="fr_746"></span>[747](#fn_746.md) the tents, first of all on finding
food they satisfied their hunger, then they laid hold of as much gold
and silver as they could. But whilst they were intent on the booty
alone, they arranged to announce to the king that the Syrians had fled,
for they thought this more virtuous than to withhold the information and
keep for themselves the plunder gained by deceit.

<span id="iv.i.iv.xx-p14"></span>122. At this information the
people <span id="fr_747"></span>[748](#fn_747.md) went forth and plundered
the Syrian camp. The supplies of the enemy produced an abundance, and
brought about cheapness of corn according to the prophet’s word: “A
measure of fine flour for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a
shekel.” In this rejoicing of the people, that officer on whose hand the
king leaned died, being crushed and trodden under foot by the people as
the crowds kept hurrying to go out or returned with great rejoicing.

[Next: Chapter XXI. Esther in danger of her life followed the grace of
virtue; nay, even a heathen king did so, when death was threatened to a
man most friendly to him. For friendship must ever be combined with
virtue, as the examples of Jonathan and Ahimelech show.](2100115.md)
