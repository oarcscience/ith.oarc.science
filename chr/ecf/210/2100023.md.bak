#### <span id="iv.i.ii.xi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XI.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xi-p1"></span>It is proved by the witness of Scripture
that all duty is either “ordinary” or “perfect.” To which is added a
word in praise of mercy, and an exhortation to practise it.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xi-p2"></span>36. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.ii.xi-p2.1"></span>Every</span> duty is either “ordinary” or
“perfect,” <span id="fr_70"></span>[71](#fn_70.md) a fact which we can also
confirm by the authority of the Scriptures. For we read in the Gospel
that the Lord said: “If thou wilt enter into life, keep the
commandments. He saith: Which? Jesus said to him: Thou shalt do no
murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt
not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother, Thou shalt
love thy neighbour as thyself.” <span id="fr_71"></span>[72](#fn_71.md)
These are ordinary duties, to which something is wanting.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xi-p5"></span>37. Upon this the young man says to Him:
“All these things have I kept from my youth up, what lack I yet? Jesus
said unto him: If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell all thy goods and
give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come and
follow Me.” <span id="fr_72"></span>[73](#fn_72.md) And earlier the same is
written, where the Lord says that we must love our enemies, and pray for
those that falsely accuse and persecute us, and bless those that curse
us. <span id="fr_73"></span>[74](#fn_73.md) This we are bound to do, if we
would be perfect as our Father Who is in heaven; Who bids the sun to
shed his rays over the evil and the good, and makes the lands of the
whole universe fertile with rain and dew without any distinction. <span
id="fr_74"></span>[75](#fn_74.md) This, then, is a perfect duty (the Greeks
call it <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.i.ii.xi-p8.2"></span>κατόρθωμα</span>), whereby all things are
put right which could have any failings in them.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xi-p9"></span>38. Mercy, also, is a good thing, for it
makes men perfect, in that it imitates the perfect Father. Nothing
graces the Christian soul so much as mercy; mercy as shown chiefly
towards the poor, that thou mayest treat them as sharers in common with
thee in the produce of nature, which brings forth the fruits of the
earth for use to all. Thus thou mayest freely give to a poor man what
thou hast, and in this way help him who is thy brother and companion.
Thou bestowest silver; he receives life. Thou givest money; he considers
it his fortune. Thy coin makes up all his property.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xi-p10"></span>39. Further, he bestows more on thee
than thou on him, since he is thy debtor in regard to thy salvation. If
thou clothe the naked, thou clothest thyself with righteousness; if thou
bring the stranger under thy roof, if thou support the needy, he
procures for thee the friendship of the saints and eternal habitations.
That is no small recompense. Thou sowest earthly things and receivest
heavenly. Dost thou wonder at the judgment of God in the case of holy
Job? Wonder rather at his virtue, in that he could say: “I was an eye to
the blind, and a foot to the lame. I was a father to the poor. Their
shoulders were made warm with the skins of my lambs. The stranger dwelt
not at my gates, but my door was open to every one that came.” <span
id="fr_75"></span>[76](#fn_75.md) Clearly blessed is he from whose house a
poor man has never gone with empty hand. Nor again is any one more
blessed than he who is sensible of the needs of the poor, and the
hardships of the weak and helpless. In the day of judgment he will
receive salvation from the Lord, Whom he will have as his debtor for the
mercy he has shown.

exercise of mercy, he shows that God cares for human actions; and proves
on the evidence of Job that all wicked men are unhappy in the very
abundance of their wealth.](2100024.md)
