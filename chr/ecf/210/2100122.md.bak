<span id="iv.ii.ii.iii"></span>

#### <span id="iv.ii.ii.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter II.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.iii-p1"></span>The words, “All things were made by
Him,” are not a proof that the Holy Spirit is included amongst all
things, since He was not made. For otherwise it could be proved by other
passages that the Son, and even the Father Himself, must be numbered
amongst all things, which would be similar irreverence.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.iii-p2"></span>27. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.ii.ii.iii-p2.1"></span>This</span> seems, gracious Emperor, to be
a full account of our right feeling, but to the impious it does not seem
so. Observe what they are striving after. For the heretics are wont to
say that the Holy Spirit is to be reckoned amongst all things, because
it is written of God the Son: “All things were made by Him.” <span
id="fr_822"></span>[823](#fn_822.md)

<span id="iv.ii.ii.iii-p4"></span>28. How utterly confused is a course
of argument which does not hold to the truth, and is involved in an
inverted order of statements. For this argument would be of value for
the statement that the Holy Spirit is amongst all things, if they proved
that He was made. For Scripture says that all things which were made
were made by the Son; but since we are not taught that the Holy Spirit
was made, He certainly cannot be proved to be amongst all things Who was
neither made as all things are, nor created. To me this testimony is of
use for establishing each point; firstly, that He is proved to be above
all things, because He was not made; and secondly, that because He is
above all things, He is seen not to have been made, and is not to be
numbered amongst those things which were made.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.iii-p5"></span>29. But if any one, because the
Evangelist stated that all things were made by the Word, making no
exception of the Holy Spirit (although the Spirit of God speaking in
John said: “All things were made by Him,” and said not we were all
things which were made; whilst the Lord Himself distinctly showed that
the Spirit of God spoke in the Evangelists, saying, “For it will not be
you that speak, but the Spirit of your Father that speaketh in
you”), <span id="fr_823"></span>[824](#fn_823.md) yet if any one, as I
said, does not except the Holy Spirit in this place, but numbers Him
amongst all, he consequently does not except the Son of God in that
passage where the Apostle says: “Yet to us there is one God the Father,
of Whom are all things, and we by Him.” <span
id="fr_824"></span>[825](#fn_824.md) But that he may know that the Son is
not amongst all things, let him read what follows, for when he says:
“And one Lord Jesus Christ, by Whom are all things,” <span
id="fr_825"></span>[826](#fn_825.md) he certainly excepts the Son of God
from all, who also excepted the Father.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.iii-p9"></span>30. But it is equal irreverence to
detract from the dignity of the Father, or the Son, or the Holy Spirit.
For he believes not in the Father who does not believe in the Son, nor
does he believe in the Son of God who does not believe in the Spirit,
nor can faith stand without the rule of truth. For he who has begun to
deny the oneness of power in the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit
certainly cannot prove his divided faith in points where there is no
division. So, then, since complete piety is to believe rightly, so
complete impiety is to believe wrongly.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.iii-p10"></span>31. Therefore they who think that the
Holy Spirit ought to be numbered amongst all things, because they read
that all things were made by the Son, must needs also think that the Son
is to be numbered amongst all things, because they read: “All things are
of God.” <span id="fr_826"></span>[827](#fn_826.md) But, consequently, they
also do not separate the Father from all things, who do not separate the
Son from all creatures, since, as all things are of the Father, so, too,
all things are by the Son. And the Apostle, because of his foresight in
the Spirit, used this very expression, lest he should seem to the
impious who had heard that the Son had said, “That which My Father hath
given Me is greater than all,” <span id="fr_827"></span>[828](#fn_827.md)
to have included the Son amongst all.

[Next: Chapter III. The statement of the Apostle, that all things are of
the Father by the Son, does not separate the Spirit from Their company,
since what is referred to one Person is also attributed to each. So
those baptized in the Name of Christ are held to be baptized in the Name
of the Father and of the Holy Spirit, if, that is, there is belief in
the Three Persons, otherwise the baptism will be null. This also applies
to baptism in the Name of the Holy Spirit. If because of one passage the
Holy Spirit is separated from the Father and the Son, it will
necessarily follow from other passages that the Father will be
subordinated to the Son. The Son is worshipped by angels, not by the
Spirit, for the latter is His witness, not His servant. Where the Son is
spoken of as being before all, it is to be understood of creatures. The
great dignity of the Holy Spirit is proved by the absence of forgiveness
for the sin against Him. How it is that such sin cannot be forgiven, and
how the Spirit is one.](2100123.md)
