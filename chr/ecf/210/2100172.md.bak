#### <span id="iv.ii.iv.xx-p0.1"></span>Chapter XX.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.xx-p1"></span>The river flowing from the Throne of
God is a figure of the Holy Spirit, but by the waters spoken of by David
the powers of heaven are intended. The kingdom of God is the work of the
Spirit; and it is no matter for wonder if He reigns in this together
with the Son, since St. Paul promises that we too shall reign with the
Son.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.xx-p2"></span>153. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.ii.iv.xx-p2.1"></span>And</span> this, again, is not a trivial
matter that we read that a river goes forth from the throne of God. For
you read the words of the Evangelist John to this purport: “And He
showed me a river of living water, bright as crystal, proceeding out of
the throne of God and of the Lamb. In the midst of the street thereof,
and on either side, was the tree of life, bearing twelve kinds of
fruits, yielding its fruit every month, and the leaves of the tree were
for the healing of all nations.” <span
id="fr_1431"></span>[1432](#fn_1431.md)

<span id="iv.ii.iv.xx-p4"></span>154. This is certainly the River
proceeding from the throne of God, that is, the Holy Spirit, Whom he
drinks who believes in Christ, as He Himself says: “If any man thirst,
let him come to Me and drink. He that believeth on Me, as saith the
Scripture, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. But this
spoke He of the Spirit.” <span id="fr_1432"></span>[1433](#fn_1432.md)
Therefore the river is the Spirit.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.xx-p6"></span>155. This, then, is in the throne of
God, for the water washes not the throne of God. Then, whatever you may
understand by that water, David said not that it was above the throne of
God, but above the heavens, <span id="page_157">p. 157</span> <span
id="iv.ii.iv.xx-Page_157"></span>for it is written: “Let the waters
which are above the heavens praise the Name of the Lord.” <span
id="fr_1433"></span>[1434](#fn_1433.md) Let *them* praise, he says, not let
*it* praise. For if he had intended us to understand the element of
water, he would certainly have said, Let it praise, but by using the
plural he intended the Powers to be understood.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.xx-p8"></span>156. And what wonder is it if the Holy
Spirit is in the throne of God, since the kingdom of God itself is the
work of the Holy Spirit, as it is written: “For the kingdom of God is
not meat and drink, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy
Spirit.” <span id="fr_1434"></span>[1435](#fn_1434.md) And when the Saviour
Himself says, “Every kingdom divided against itself shall be
destroyed,” <span id="fr_1435"></span>[1436](#fn_1435.md) by adding
afterwards, “But if I, by the Spirit of God, cast out devils, without
doubt the kingdom of God is come upon you,” <span
id="fr_1436"></span>[1437](#fn_1436.md) He shows that the kingdom of God is
held undivided by Himself and by the Spirit.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.xx-p12"></span>157. But what is more foolish than for
any one to deny that the Holy Spirit reigns together with Christ when
the Apostle says that even we shall reign together with Christ in the
kingdom of Christ: “If we are dead with Him, we shall also live with
Him; if we endure, we shall also reign with Him.” <span
id="fr_1437"></span>[1438](#fn_1437.md) But we by adoption, He by power; we
by grace, He by nature.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.xx-p14"></span>158. The Holy Spirit, therefore,
shares in the kingdom with the Father and the Son, and He is of one
nature with Them, of one Lordship, and also of one power.

[Next: Chapter XXI. Isaiah was sent by the Spirit, and accordingly the
same Spirit was seen by him. What is meant by the revolving wheels, and
the divers wings, and how since the Spirit is proclaimed Lord of Sabaoth
by the Seraphim, certainly none but impious men can deny Him this
title.](2100173.md)
