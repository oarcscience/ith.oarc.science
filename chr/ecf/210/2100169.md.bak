#### <span id="iv.ii.iv.xvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVII.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.xvii-p1"></span>St. Ambrose shows by instances that
the places in which those words were spoken help to the understanding of
the words of the Lord; he shows that Christ uttered the passage quoted
from St. John in Solomon’s porch, by which is signified the mind of a
wise man, for he says that Christ would not have uttered this saying in
the heart of a foolish or contentious man. He goes on to say that Christ
is stoned by those who believe not these words, and as the keys of
heaven were given to Peter for his confession of them, so Iscariot,
because he believed not the same, perished evilly. He takes this
opportunity to inveigh against the Jews who bought the Son of God and
sold Joseph. He explains the price paid for each mystically; and having
in the same manner expounded the murmuring of the traitor concerning
Magdalene’s ointment, he adds that Christ is bought in one way by
heretics in another way by Catholics, and that those in vain take to
themselves the name of Christians who sever the Spirit from the Father.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.xvii-p2"></span>118. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.ii.iv.xvii-p2.1"></span>It</span> is worth while to notice in
what place the Lord held this discussion, for His utterances are often
\[better\] estimated by the kind of places in which He conversed. When
about to fast, He is led (as we read) into the wilderness to render vain
the devil’s temptations. For although it deserves praise to have lived
temperately in the midst of abundance, yet the enticements of temptation
are more frequent amongst riches and pleasures. Then the tempter, in
order to try Him, promises Him abundance, and the Lord in order to
overcome cherishes hunger. Now I do not deny that temperance can exist
in the midst of riches; but although he who navigates the sea often
escapes, yet he is more exposed to peril than he who will not go to sea.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.xvii-p3"></span>119. Let us consider some other
points. When about to promise the kingdom of heaven, Jesus went up into
a mountain. At another time He leads His disciples through the
corn-fields, when about to sow in their minds the crop of heavenly
precepts, so that a plentiful harvest of souls should ripen. When about
to consummate the work of the flesh which He had taken, having now seen
perfection in His disciples, whom He had established upon the root of
His words, He enters a garden, that He might plant the young
olive-trees <span id="fr_1381"></span>[1382](#fn_1381.md) in the house of
the Lord, and that He might water the just flourishing like a
palm-tree, <span id="fr_1382"></span>[1383](#fn_1382.md) and the fruitful
vine with the stream of His Blood.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.xvii-p6"></span>120. In this passage too He was
walking, as we read, in Solomon’s porch on the day of the dedication,
that is, Christ was walking in the breast of the wise and prudent, to
dedicate his good affection to Himself. What that porch was the prophet
teaches, saying: “I will walk in the midst of Thy house in the innocency
of my heart.” <span id="fr_1383"></span>[1384](#fn_1383.md) So, then, we
have in our own selves the house of God, we have the halls, we have also
the porches, and we have the courts, for it is written: “Let thy waters
flow abroad in thy courts.” <span id="fr_1384"></span>[1385](#fn_1384.md)
Open, then, this porch of thy heart to the Word of God, Who says to
thee: “Open thy mouth wide and I will fill it.” <span
id="fr_1385"></span>[1386](#fn_1385.md)

<span id="iv.ii.iv.xvii-p10"></span>121. Let us, therefore, hear what
the Word of God, walking in the heart of the wise and peaceful, says: “I
and My Father are One.” <span id="fr_1386"></span>[1387](#fn_1386.md) He
will not say this in the breast of the unquiet and foolish, for “the
natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are
foolishness unto him.” <span id="fr_1387"></span>[1388](#fn_1387.md) The
narrow breasts of sinners do not take in the greatness of the faith.
Lastly, the Jews hearing, “I and the Father are One, took up stones to
stone Him.” <span id="fr_1388"></span>[1389](#fn_1388.md)

<span id="iv.ii.iv.xvii-p14"></span>122. He who cannot listen to this is
a Jew; he who cannot listen to this stones Christ with the stones of his
treachery, rougher than any rock, and if you believe me, he wounds
Christ. For although He cannot now feel a wound: “For now henceforth we
know not Christ after the flesh,” <span
id="fr_1389"></span>[1390](#fn_1389.md) yet He Who rejoices in the love of
the Church is stoned by the impiety of the Arians.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.xvii-p16"></span>123. “The law of Thy mouth, O Lord,
is good unto me, I keep Thy commandments.” <span
id="fr_1390"></span>[1391](#fn_1390.md) Thou hast Thyself said that Thou
art one with the Father. Because Peter believed this, he received the
keys of the kingdom of heaven, and without anxiety for himself forgave
sins. Judas, because he believed not this, strangled himself with the
cord of his own wickedness. O the hard stones of unbelieving words! O
the unseemly cord of the betrayer, and the still more hideous
purchase-money of the Jews! O hateful money wherewith either the just is
bought for death, or sold! Joseph was sold, Jesus Christ was bought,
<span id="page_153">p. 153</span> <span
id="iv.ii.iv.xvii-Page_153"></span>the one to slavery, the Other to
death. O detestable inheritance, O deadly sale, which either sells a
brother to suffering or sets a price on the Lord to destroy Him, the
Purchaser of the salvation of all.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.xvii-p18"></span>124. The Jews did violence to two
things which are chief of all, faith and duty, and in each to Christ the
Author of faith and duty. For both in the patriarch Joseph was there a
type of Christ, and Christ Himself came in the truth of His Body, “Who
counted it not robbery that He should be equal with God, but took on Him
the form of a servant,” <span id="fr_1391"></span>[1392](#fn_1391.md)
because of our fall, that is to say, taking slavery upon Himself and not
shrinking from suffering.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.xvii-p20"></span>125. In one place the sale is for
twenty pieces, in the other for thirty. For how could His true price be
apprehended, Whose value cannot be limited? There is error in the price
because there is error in the inquiry. The sale is for twenty pieces in
the Old Testament, for thirty in the New; for the Truth is of more value
than the type, Grace is more generous than training, the Presence is
better than the Law, for the Law promised the Coming, the Coming
fulfilled the Law.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.xvii-p21"></span>126. The Ishmaelites made their
purchase for twenty pieces, the Jews for thirty. And this is no trivial
figure. The faithless are more lavish for iniquity than the faithful for
salvation. It is, however, fitting to consider the quality of each
agreement. Twenty pieces are the price of him sold to slavery, thirty
pieces of Him delivered to the Cross. For although the Mysteries of the
Incarnation and of the Passion must be in like manner matters of
amazement, yet the fulfilment of faith is in the Mystery of the Passion.
I do not indeed value less the birth from the holy Virgin, but I receive
even more gratefully the Mystery of the sacred Body. What is more full
of mercy than that He should forgive me the wrongs done to Himself? But
it is even fuller measure that He gave us so great a gift, that He Who
was not to die because He was God, should die by our death, that we
might live by His Spirit.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.xvii-p22"></span>127. Lastly, it was not without
meaning that Judas Iscariot valued that ointment at three hundred pence,
which seems certainly by the statement of the price itself to set forth
the Lord’s cross. Whence, too, the Lord says: “For she, pouring this
ointment on My body, did it for My burial.” <span
id="fr_1392"></span>[1393](#fn_1392.md) Why, then, did Judas value this at
so high a rate? Because remission of sins is of more value to sinners,
and forgiveness seems to be more precious. Lastly, you find it written:
“To whom much is forgiven the same loveth more.” <span
id="fr_1393"></span>[1394](#fn_1393.md) Therefore sinners themselves also
confess the grace of the Lord’s Passion which they have lost, and they
bear witness to Christ who persecuted Him.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.xvii-p25"></span>128. Or because, “into a malicious
soul wisdom does not enter,” <span id="fr_1394"></span>[1395](#fn_1394.md)
the evil disposition of the traitor uttered this, and he valued the
suffering of the Lord’s body at a dearer rate, that by the immensity of
the price he might draw all away from the faith. And therefore the Lord
offered Himself without price, that the necessity of poverty might hold
no one back from Christ. The patriarchs sold Him for a small price that
all might buy. Isaiah said: “Ye that have no money go buy and drink; eat
ye without money,” <span id="fr_1395"></span>[1396](#fn_1395.md) that he
might gain him who had no money. O traitor Judas, thou valuest the
ointment of His Passion at three hundred pence, and sellest His Passion
for thirty pence. <span id="fr_1396"></span>[1397](#fn_1396.md) Profuse in
valuing, mean in selling.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.xvii-p29"></span>129. So, then, all do not buy Christ
at the same price; Photinus, who buys Him for death, buys Him at one
price; the Arian, who buys Him to wrong Him, at another price; the
Catholic, who buys Him to glorify Him, at another. But he buys Him
without money according to that which is written: “He that hath no money
let him buy without price.” <span id="fr_1397"></span>[1398](#fn_1397.md)

<span id="iv.ii.iv.xvii-p31"></span>130. “Not all,” says Christ, “that
say unto Me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven!” <span
id="fr_1398"></span>[1399](#fn_1398.md) Although many call themselves
Christians, and make use of the name, yet not all shall receive the
reward. Both Cain offered sacrifice, and Judas received the kiss, but it
was said to him, “Judas, betrayest thou the Son of Man with a
kiss?” <span id="fr_1399"></span>[1400](#fn_1399.md) that is, thou fillest
up thy wickedness with the pledge of affection, and sowest hatred with
the implement of peace, and inflictest death with the outward token of
love.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.xvii-p34"></span>131. Let not, then, the Arians
flatter themselves with the employment of the name, because they call
themselves Christians. The Lord will answer them: You set forward My
Name, and deny My Substance, but I do not recognize My Name where My
eternal Godhead is not. That is not My Name which is divided from the
Father, and <span id="page_154">p. 154</span> <span
id="iv.ii.iv.xvii-Page_154"></span>separated from the Spirit; I do not
recognize My Name where I do not recognize My doctrine; I do not
recognize My Name where I do not recognize My Spirit. For he knows not
that he is comparing the Spirit of the Father to those servants whom He
created. Concerning which point we have already spoken at length. <span

<span id="iv.ii.iv.xvii-p28"></span> St. Ambrose is not quite accurate
here in his proportions, though the point is in itself immaterial. The
*denarius,* or “penny,” was worth about ninepence, and was the day wage
of a labourer; the shekel or “piece of silver,” was worth more, being of
the value of four *denarii.* Thirty shekels was the price of a slave.

[Next: Chapter XVIII. As he purposes to establish the Godhead of the
Holy Spirit by the points already discussed, St. Ambrose touches again
on some of them; for instance, that He does not commit but forgives sin;
that He is not a creature but the Creator; and lastly, that He does not
offer but receives worship.](2100170.md)
