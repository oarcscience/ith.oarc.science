#### <span id="iv.i.iv.xxii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXII.

<span id="iv.i.iv.xxii-p1"></span>Virtue must never be given up for the
sake of a friend. If, however, one has to bear witness against a friend,
it must be done with caution. Between friends what candour is needed in
opening the heart, what magnanimity in suffering, what freedom in
finding fault! Friendship is the guardian of virtues, which are not to
be found but in men of like character. It must be mild in rebuking and
averse to seeking its own advantage; whence it happens that true friends
are scarce among the rich. What is the dignity of friendship? The
treachery of a friend, as it is worse, so it is also more hateful than
another’s, as is recognized from the example of Judas and of Job’s
friends.

<span id="iv.i.iv.xxii-p2"></span>125. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.iv.xxii-p2.1"></span>Nothing</span>, then, must be set before
<span id="page_88">p. 88</span> <span
id="iv.i.iv.xxii-Page_88"></span>virtue; and that it may never be set
aside by the desire for friendship, Scripture also gives us a warning on
the subject of friendship. There are, indeed various questions raised
among philosophers; <span id="fr_754"></span>[755](#fn_754.md) for instance
whether a man ought for the sake of a friend to plot against his country
or not, so as to serve his friend? Whether it is right to break one’s
faith, and so aid and maintain a friend’s advantage?

<span id="iv.i.iv.xxii-p4"></span>126. And Scripture also says: “A maul,
and a sword, and a sharp arrow, so is a man that beareth false witness
against his friend.” <span id="fr_755"></span>[756](#fn_755.md) But note
what it adds. It blames not witness given against a friend, but false
witness. For what if the cause of God or of one’s country compels one to
give witness? Ought friendship to take a higher place than our religion,
or our love for our fellow-citizens? In these matters, however, true
witness is required so that a friend may not be assailed by the
treachery of a friend, by whose good faith he ought to be acquitted. A
man, then, ought never to please a friend who desires evil, or to plot
against one who is innocent.

<span id="iv.i.iv.xxii-p6"></span>127. Certainly, if it is necessary to
give witness, then, when one knows of any fault in a friend, one ought
to rebuke him secretly—if he does not listen, one must do it openly. For
rebukes are good, <span id="fr_756"></span>[757](#fn_756.md) and often
better than a silent friendship. Even if a friend thinks himself hurt,
still rebuke him; and if the bitterness of the correction wounds his
mind, still rebuke him and fear not. “The wounds of a friend are better
than the kisses of flatterers.” <span id="fr_757"></span>[758](#fn_757.md)
Rebuke, then, thy erring friend; forsake not an innocent one. For
friendship ought to be steadfast <span id="fr_758"></span>[759](#fn_758.md)
and to rest firm in true affection. We ought not to change our friends
in childish fashion at some idle fancy.

<span id="iv.i.iv.xxii-p10"></span>128. Open thy breast to a friend that
he may be faithful to thee, and that thou mayest receive from him the
delight of thy life. “For a faithful friend is the medicine of life and
the grace of immortality.” <span id="fr_759"></span>[760](#fn_759.md) Give
way to a friend as to an equal, and be not ashamed to be beforehand with
thy friend in doing kindly duties. For friendship knows nothing of
pride. So the wise man says: “Do not blush to greet a friend.” <span
id="fr_760"></span>[761](#fn_760.md) Do not desert a friend in time of
need, nor forsake him nor fail him, for friendship is the support of
life. Let us then bear our burdens as the Apostle has taught: <span
id="fr_761"></span>[762](#fn_761.md) for he spoke to those whom the charity
of the same one body had embraced together. If friends in prosperity
help friends, why do they not also in times of adversity offer their
support? Let us aid by giving counsel, let us offer our best endeavours,
let us sympathize with them with all our heart.

<span id="iv.i.iv.xxii-p14"></span>129. If necessary, let us endure for
a friend even hardship. Often enmity has to be borne for the sake of a
friend’s innocence; oftentimes revilings, if one defends and answers for
a friend who is found fault with and accused. Do not be afraid of such
displeasure, for the voice of the just says: “Though evil come upon me,
I will endure it for a friend’s sake.” <span
id="fr_762"></span>[763](#fn_762.md) In adversity, too, a friend is proved,
for in prosperity all seem to be friends. But as in adversity patience
and endurance are needed, so in prosperity strong influence is wanted to
check and confute the arrogance of a friend who becomes overbearing.

<span id="iv.i.iv.xxii-p16"></span>130. How nobly Job when he was in
adversity said: “Pity me, my friends, pity me.” <span
id="fr_763"></span>[764](#fn_763.md) That is not a cry as it were of
misery, but rather one of blame. For when he was unjustly reproached by
his friends, he answered: “Pity me, my friends,” that is, ye ought to
show pity, but instead ye assail and overwhelm a man with whose
sufferings ye ought to show sympathy for friendship’s sake.

<span id="iv.i.iv.xxii-p18"></span>131. Preserve, then, my sons, that
friendship ye have begun with your brethren, for nothing in the world is
more beautiful than that. It is indeed a comfort in this life to have
one to whom thou canst open thy heart, <span
id="fr_764"></span>[765](#fn_764.md) with whom thou canst share
confidences, and to whom thou canst entrust the secrets of thy heart. It
is a comfort to have a trusty man by thy side, who will rejoice with
thee in prosperity, sympathize in troubles, encourage in persecution.
What good friends those Hebrew children were whom the flames of the
fiery furnace did not separate from their love of each other! <span
id="fr_765"></span>[766](#fn_765.md) Of them we have already spoken. Holy
David says well: “Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant,
inseparable in their life, in death they were not divided.” <span
id="fr_766"></span>[767](#fn_766.md)

<span id="iv.i.iv.xxii-p22"></span>132. This is the fruit of friendship;
and so faith <span id="fr_767"></span>[768](#fn_767.md) may not be put
aside for the sake of friendship. He cannot be a friend to a man who has
been unfaithful to God. Friendship is the guardian of pity and the
teacher of equality, so as to make the superior equal to the inferior,
and the inferior <span id="page_89">p. 89</span> <span
id="iv.i.iv.xxii-Page_89"></span>to the superior. <span
id="fr_768"></span>[769](#fn_768.md) For there can be no friendship between
diverse characters, <span id="fr_769"></span>[770](#fn_769.md) and so the
good-will of either ought to be mutually suited to the other. Let not
authority be wanting to the inferior if the matter demands it, nor
humility to the superior. Let him listen to the other as though he were
of like position—an equal, and let the other warn and reprove like a
friend, not from a desire to show off, but with a deep feeling of love.

<span id="iv.i.iv.xxii-p26"></span>134. Let not thy warning be harsh,
nor thy rebuke bitter, <span id="fr_770"></span>[771](#fn_770.md) for as
friendship ought to avoid flattery, so, too, ought it to be free from
arrogance. For what is a friend but a partner in love, <span
id="fr_771"></span>[772](#fn_771.md) to whom thou unitest and attachest thy
soul, and with whom thou blendest so as to desire from being two to
become one; to whom thou entrustest thyself as to a second self, from
whom thou fearest nothing, and from whom thou demandest nothing
dishonourable for the sake of thine own advantage. Friendship is not
meant as a source of revenue, <span id="fr_772"></span>[773](#fn_772.md)
but is full of seemliness, full of grace. Friendship is a virtue, not a
way of making money. It is produced, not by money, but by esteem; not by
the offer of rewards, but by a mutual rivalry in doing kindnesses.

<span id="iv.i.iv.xxii-p30"></span>134. Lastly, the friendships of the
poor are generally better than those of the rich, <span
id="fr_773"></span>[774](#fn_773.md) and often the rich are without
friends, whilst the poor have many. For true friendship cannot exist
where there is lying flattery. Many try fawningly to please the rich,
but no one cares to make pretence to a poor man. Whatsoever is stated to
a poor man is true, his friendship is free from envy.

<span id="iv.i.iv.xxii-p32"></span>135. What is more precious than
friendship which is shared alike by angels and by men? Wherefore the
Lord Jesus says: “Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of
unrighteousness, that they may receive you into eternal
habitations.” <span id="fr_774"></span>[775](#fn_774.md) God Himself makes
us friends instead of servants, as He Himself says: “Ye are My friends
if ye do whatsoever I command you.” <span
id="fr_775"></span>[776](#fn_775.md) He gave us a pattern of friendship to
follow. We are to fulfil the wish of a friend, to unfold to him our
secrets which we hold in our own hearts, and are not to disregard his
confidences. Let us show him our heart and he will open his to us.
Therefore He says: “I have called you friends, for I have made known
unto you all things whatsoever I have heard of My Father.” <span
id="fr_776"></span>[777](#fn_776.md) A friend, then, if he is a true one,
hides nothing; he pours forth his soul as the Lord Jesus poured forth
the mysteries of His Father.

<span id="iv.i.iv.xxii-p36"></span>136. So he who does the will of God
is His friend and is honoured with this name. He who is of one mind with
Him, he too is His friend. For there is unity of mind in friends, and no
one is more hateful than the man that injures friendship. Hence in the
traitor the Lord found this the worst point on which to condemn his
treachery, namely, that he gave no sign of gratitude and had mingled the
poison of malice at the table of friendship. So He says: “It was thou, a
man of like mind, My guide and Mine acquaintance, who ever didst take
pleasant meals with Me.” <span id="fr_777"></span>[778](#fn_777.md) That
is: it could not be endured, for thou didst fall upon Him Who granted
grace to thee. “For if My enemy had reproached Me I could have borne
it, <span id="fr_778"></span>[779](#fn_778.md) and I would have hid Myself
from him who hated Me.” An enemy can be avoided; a friend cannot, if he
desires to lay a plot. Let us guard against him to whom we do not
entrust our plans; we cannot guard against him to whom we have already
entrusted them. And so to show up all the hatefulness of the sin He did
not say: Thou, My servant, My apostle; but thou, a man of like mind with
Me; that is: thou art not My but thy own betrayer, for thou didst betray
a man of like mind with thyself.

<span id="iv.i.iv.xxii-p39"></span>137. The Lord Himself, when He was
displeased with the three princes who had not deferred to holy Job,
wished to pardon them through their friend, so that the prayer of
friendship might win remission of sins. Therefore Job asked and God
pardoned. Friendship helped them whom arrogance had harmed. <span
id="fr_779"></span>[780](#fn_779.md)

<span id="iv.i.iv.xxii-p41"></span>138. These things I have left with
you, my children, that you may guard them in your minds—you yourselves
will prove whether they will be of any advantage. Meanwhile they offer
you a large number of examples, for almost all the examples drawn from
our forefathers, and also many a word of theirs, are included within
these three books; so that, although the language may not be graceful,
yet a succession of old-time examples set down in such small compass may
offer much instruction.
