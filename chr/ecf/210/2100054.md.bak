#### <span id="iv.i.ii.xlii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XLII.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xlii-p1"></span>The powers that be are not needlessly
to be irritated. One must not lend one’s ears to flattery.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xlii-p2"></span>217. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.ii.xlii-p2.1"></span>I think</span> we must take care, lest in
being led on by too great a desire for glory, we should abuse the powers
that be, and arouse the minds of the heathen, who are opposed to us, to
desire persecution, and excite them to anger. How many do some cause to
perish, that they themselves may continue to the end, and overcome their
tortures!

<span id="iv.i.ii.xlii-p3"></span>218. We must also look to it that we
do not open our ears to flatterers. To allow oneself to be smoothed down
by flattery seems to be a sign not only of want of fortitude, but a sign
of actual cowardice.
