<span id="iv.vii.ii.vi"></span>

#### <span id="iv.vii.ii.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.

<span id="iv.vii.ii.vi-p1"></span>St. Ambrose explains that he is not
speaking against marriage, and proceeds to compare the advantages and
disadvantages of the single and married state.

<span id="iv.vii.ii.vi-p2"></span>24. I <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vii.ii.vi-p2.1"></span>am</span> not indeed discouraging
marriage, but am enlarging upon the benefits of virginity. “He who is
weak,” says the Apostle, “eateth herbs.” <span
id="fr_3183"></span>[3184](#fn_3183.md) I consider one thing necessary, I
admire another. “Art thou bound to a wife? Seek not to be loosed. Art
thou free from a wife? Seek not a wife.” <span
id="fr_3184"></span>[3185](#fn_3184.md) This is the command to those who
are. But what does he say concerning virgins? “He who giveth his virgin
in marriage doeth well, and he who giveth her not doeth better.” <span
id="fr_3185"></span>[3186](#fn_3185.md) The one sins not if she marries,
the other, if she marries not, it is for eternity. In the former is the
remedy for weakness, in the latter the glory of chastity. The former is
not reproved, the latter is praised.

<span id="iv.vii.ii.vi-p6"></span>25. Let us compare, if it pleases you,
the advantages of married women with that which awaits virgins. Though
the noble woman boasts of her abundant offspring, yet the more she bears
the more she endures. Let her count up the comforts of her children, but
let her likewise count up the troubles. She marries and weeps. How many
vows does she make with tears. She conceives, and her fruitfulness
brings her trouble before offspring. She brings forth and is ill. How
sweet a pledge which begins with danger and ends in danger, which will
cause pain before pleasure! It is purchased by perils, and is not
possessed at her own will.

<span id="iv.vii.ii.vi-p7"></span>26. Why speak of the troubles of
nursing, training, and marrying? These are the miseries of those who are
fortunate. A mother has heirs, but it increases her sorrows. For we must
not speak of adversity, lest the minds of the holiest parents tremble.
Consider, my sister, how hard it must be to bear what one must not speak
of. And this is in this present age. But the days shall come when they
shall say: “Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never
bare.” <span id="fr_3186"></span>[3187](#fn_3186.md) For the daughters of
this age are conceived, and conceive; but the daughter of the kingdom
refrains from wedded pleasure, and the pleasure of the flesh, that she
may be holy in body and in spirit.

<span id="iv.vii.ii.vi-p9"></span>27. Why should I further speak of the
painful ministrations and services due to their husbands from wives, to
whom before slaves God gave the command to serve? <span
id="fr_3187"></span>[3188](#fn_3187.md) And I mention these things that
they may comply more willingly, whose reward, if approved, is love; if
not approved, punishment for the fault.

<span id="iv.vii.ii.vi-p11"></span>28. And in this position spring up
those incentives to vice, in that they paint their faces with various
colours, fearing not to please their husbands; and from staining their
faces, come to think of staining their chastity. What madness is here,
to change the fashion of nature and seek a painting, and while fearing a
husband’s judgment to give up their own. For she is the first to speak
against herself who wishes to change that which is natural to her. So,
while studying to please others, she displeases herself. What truer
witness to thy unsightliness do we require, O woman, than thyself who
art afraid to be seen? If thou art beautiful, why hidest thou thyself?
If unsightly, why dost thou falsely pretend to beauty, so as to have
neither the satisfaction of thy own conscience, nor of the error of
another? For he loves another, thou desirest to please another. And art
thou angry if he love another, who is taught to do so in thy own person?
Thou art an evil teacher of thy own injury.

<span id="iv.vii.ii.vi-p12"></span>29. And next, what expense is
necessary that even a beautiful wife may not fail to please? Costly
necklaces on the one hand <span id="page_368">p. 368</span> <span
id="iv.vii.ii.vi-Page_368"></span>hang on her neck, on the other a robe
woven with gold is dragged along the ground. Is this display purchased,
or is it a real possession? And what varied enticements of perfumes are
made use of! The ears are weighed down with gems, a different colour
from nature is dropped into the eyes. What is there left which is her
own, when so much is changed? The married woman loves her own
perceptions, and does she think that this is to live?

<span id="iv.vii.ii.vi-p13"></span>30. But you, O happy virgins, who
know not such torments, rather than ornaments, whose holy modesty,
beaming in your bashful cheeks, and sweet chastity are a beauty, ye do
not, intent upon the eyes of men, consider as merits what is gained by
the errors of others. You, too, have indeed your own beauty, furnished
by the comeliness of virtue, not of the body, to which age puts not an
end, which death cannot take away, nor any sickness injure. Let God
alone be sought as the judge of loveliness, Who loves even in less
beautiful bodies the more beautiful souls. You know nothing of the
burden and pain of childbearing, but more are the offspring of a pious
soul, which esteems all as its children, which is rich in successors,
barren of all bereavements, which knows no deaths, but has many heirs.

<span id="iv.vii.ii.vi-p14"></span>31. So the holy Church, ignorant of
wedlock, but fertile in bearing, is in chastity a virgin, yet a mother
in offspring. She, a virgin, bears us her children, not by a human
father, but by the Spirit. She bears us not with pain, but with the
rejoicings of the angels. She, a virgin, feeds us, not with the milk of
the body, but with that of the Apostle, wherewith he fed the tender age
of the people who were still children. <span
id="fr_3188"></span>[3189](#fn_3188.md) For what bride has more children
than holy Church, who is a virgin in her sacraments and a mother to her
people, whose fertility even holy Scripture attests, saying, “For many
more are the children of the desolate than of her that hath an
husband”? <span id="fr_3189"></span>[3190](#fn_3189.md) She has not an
husband, but she has a Bridegroom, inasmuch as she, whether as the
Church amongst nations, or as the soul in individuals, without any loss
of modesty, she weds the Word of God as her eternal Spouse, free from
all injury, full of reason.

[Next: Chapter VII. St. Ambrose exhorts parents to train their children
to virginity, and sets before them the troubles arising from their
desire to have grandchildren. He says however that he does not forbid
marriage, but rather defends it against heretics who oppose it. Still
setting virginity before marriage, he speaks of the beauty of their
spouse, and of the gifts wherewith He adorns them, and applies to these
points certain verses of the Song of Songs.](2100327.md)
