#### <span id="iv.i.iii.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.

<span id="iv.i.iii.iv-p1"></span>The same argument, namely, that
blessedness is not lessened or added to by external matters, is
illustrated by the example of men of old.

<span id="iv.i.iii.iv-p2"></span>10. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.iii.iv-p2.1"></span>There</span> is, then, a blessedness even
in pains and griefs. All which virtue with its sweetness checks and
restrains, abounding as it does in natural resources for either soothing
conscience or increasing grace. For Moses was blessed in no small degree
when, surrounded by the Egyptians and shut in by the sea, he found by
his merits a way for himself and the people to go through the
waters. <span id="fr_391"></span>[392](#fn_391.md) When was he ever braver
than at the moment when, surrounded by the greatest dangers, he gave not
up the hope of safety, but besought a triumph?

<span id="iv.i.iii.iv-p4"></span>11. What of Aaron? When did he ever
think himself more blessed than when he stood between the living and the
dead, and by his presence stayed death from passing from the bodies of
the dead to the lines of the living? <span
id="fr_392"></span>[393](#fn_392.md) What shall I say of the youth Daniel,
who was so wise that, when in the midst of the lions enraged with
hunger, he was by no means overcome with terror at the fierceness of the
beasts. So free from fear was he, that he could eat, and was not afraid
he might by his example excite the animals to feed on him. <span
id="fr_393"></span>[394](#fn_393.md)

<span id="iv.i.iii.iv-p7"></span>12. There is, then, in pain a virtue
that can display the sweetness of a good conscience, and therefore it
serves as a proof that pain does not lessen the pleasure of virtue. As,
then, there is no loss of blessedness to virtue through pain, so also
the pleasures of the body and the enjoyment that benefits give add
nothing to it. On this the Apostle says well: “What things to me were
gain, those I counted loss for Christ,” and he added: “Wherefore I count
all things but loss, and do count them but dung, that I may win
Christ.” <span id="fr_394"></span>[395](#fn_394.md)

<span id="iv.i.iii.iv-p9"></span><span id="page_46">p. 46</span> <span
id="iv.i.iii.iv-Page_46"></span>13. Moses, too, thought the treasures of
Egypt to be his loss, and thus showed forth in his life the reproach of
the Cross of the Lord. He was not rich when he had abundance of money,
nor was he afterwards poor when he was in want of food, unless,
perchance, there is any one who thinks he was less happy when daily food
was wanting to him and his people in the wilderness. But yet manna, that
is, angels’ food, which surely none will dare deny to be a mark of the
greatest good and of blessedness, was given him from heaven; also the
daily shower of meat was sufficient to feed the whole multitude. <span
id="fr_395"></span>[396](#fn_395.md)

<span id="iv.i.iii.iv-p11"></span>14. Bread for food also failed Elijah,
that holy man, had he sought for it; but it seemed not to fail him
because he sought it not. Thus by the daily service of the ravens bread
was brought to him in the morning, meat in the evening. <span
id="fr_396"></span>[397](#fn_396.md) Was he any the less blessed because he
was poor to himself? Certainly not. Nay, he was the more blessed, for he
was rich toward God. It is better to be rich for others than for
oneself. He was so, for in the time of famine he asked a widow for food,
intending to repay it, so that the barrel of meal failed not for three
years and six months, and the oil jar sufficed and served the needy
widow for her daily use all that time also. <span
id="fr_397"></span>[398](#fn_397.md) Rightly did Peter wish to be there
where he saw them. Rightly did they appear in the mount with Christ in
glory, <span id="fr_398"></span>[399](#fn_398.md) for He Himself became
poor when He was rich.

<span id="iv.i.iii.iv-p15"></span>15. Riches, then, give no assistance
to living a blessed life, a fact that the Lord clearly shows in the
Gospel, saying: “Blessed are ye poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.
Blessed are they that hunger and thirst now, for they shall be filled.
Blessed are ye that weep now, for ye shall laugh.” <span
id="fr_399"></span>[400](#fn_399.md) Thus it is stated as plainly as
possible that poverty, hunger, and pain, which are considered to be
evils, not only are not hindrances to a blessed life, but are actually
so many helps toward it.

[Next: Chapter V. Those things which are generally looked on as good are
mostly hindrances to a blessed life, and those which are looked on as
evil are the materials out of which virtues grow. What belongs to
blessedness is shown by other examples.](2100068.md)
