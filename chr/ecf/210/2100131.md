<span id="iv.ii.ii.xii"></span>

#### <span id="iv.ii.ii.xii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XI.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xii-p1"></span>The Spirit is sent to all, and passes
not from place to place, for He is not limited either by time or space.
He goes forth from the Son, as the Son from the Father, in Whom He ever
abides: and also comes to us when we receive. He comes also after the
same manner as the Father Himself, from Whom He can by no means be
separated.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xii-p2"></span>116. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.ii.ii.xii-p2.1"></span>The</span> Spirit, also, is indeed said to
be sent, but the Seraph to one, the Spirit to all. The Seraph is sent to
minister, the Spirit works a mystery. The Seraph performs what is
commanded, the Spirit divides as He wills. The Seraph passes from place
to place, for he does not fill all things, but is himself filled by the
Spirit. The Seraph comes down with a certain mode of passage according
to his nature, but we cannot think this of the Spirit, of Whom the Son
of God says: “When the Paraclete shall come, even the Spirit of Truth,
Whom I send unto you, Who proceedeth from the Father.” <span
id="fr_929"></span>[930](#fn_929)

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xii-p4"></span>117. For if the Spirit proceeds from a
place and passes to a place, both the Father Himself will be found in a
place, and the <span id="page_109">p. 109</span> <span
id="iv.ii.ii.xii-Page_109"></span>Son likewise. If He goes forth from a
place, Whom the Father or the Son sends, certainly the Spirit passing
from a place, and making progress, seems to leave, according to those
impious interpretations, both the Father and the Son like some material
body.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xii-p5"></span>118. I am saying this with reference
to those who say that the Spirit comes down by movement. But neither the
Father, Who is above all not only of corporeal nature, but also of the
invisible creation, is circumscribed in any place; nor is the Son, Who,
as the Worker of all creation, is above every creature, enclosed by the
places or times of His own works; nor is the Spirit of Truth as being
the Spirit of God, circumscribed by any corporeal limits, Who since He
is incorporeal is far above the whole rational creation through the
ineffable fulness of His Godhead, having over all things the power of
breathing where He wills, and of inspiring as He wills. <span
id="fr_930"></span>[931](#fn_930)

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xii-p7"></span>119. The Spirit is not, then, sent as
it were from a place, nor does He proceed as from a place, when He
proceeds from the Son, as the Son Himself, when He says, “I came forth
from the Father, and am come into the world,” <span
id="fr_931"></span>[932](#fn_931) destroys all fancies, which can be
reckoned as from place to place. In like manner, also, when we read that
God is within or without, we certainly do not either enclose God within
anybody or separate Him from anybody, but weighing these things in a
deep and ineffable estimation, we comprehend the hiddenness of the
divine nature.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xii-p9"></span>120. Lastly, Wisdom so says that she
came forth from the mouth of the Most High, <span
id="fr_932"></span>[933](#fn_932) as not to be external to the Father,
but with the Father; for “the Word was with God;” <span
id="fr_933"></span>[934](#fn_933) and not only with God but also in God;
for He says: “I am in the Father and the Father is in Me.” <span
id="fr_934"></span>[935](#fn_934) But neither when He goes forth from
the Father does He retire from a place, nor is He separated as a body
from a body; nor when He is in the Father is He as if a body enclosed as
it were in a body. The Holy Spirit also, when He proceeds from the
Father and the Son, is not separated from the Father nor separated from
the Son. For how could He be separated from the Father Who is the Spirit
of His mouth? Which is certainly both a proof of His eternity, and
expresses the Unity of this Godhead.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xii-p13"></span>121. He exists then, and abides
always, Who is the Spirit of His mouth, but He seems to come down when
we receive Him, that He may dwell in us, that we may not be alien from
His grace. To us He seems to come down, not that He does come down, but
that our mind ascends to Him. Of which we would speak more fully did we
not remember that in the former treatise <span
id="fr_935"></span>[936](#fn_935) there was set forth that the Father
said: “Let us go down and confound their language,” <span
id="fr_936"></span>[937](#fn_936) and that the Son said: “He that loveth
Me will keep My saying, and My Father will love him, and We will come to
Him and make Our abode with Him.” <span
id="fr_937"></span>[938](#fn_937)

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xii-p17"></span>122. The Spirit, then, so comes as
does the Father, for where the Father is there is also the Son, and
where the Son is there is the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit, therefore,
is not to be supposed to come separately. But He comes not from place to
place, but from the disposition of the order to the safety of
redemption, from the grace of giving life to that of sanctification, to
translate us from earth to heaven, from wretchedness to glory, from
slavery to a kingdom.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xii-p18"></span>123. The Spirit comes, then, as the
Father comes. For the Son said, “I and the Father will come, and will
make Our abode with Him.” <span id="fr_938"></span>[939](#fn_938) Does
the Father come in a bodily fashion? Thus, then, comes the Spirit in
Whom, when He comes, is the full presence of the Father and the Son.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xii-p20"></span>124. But who can separate the Spirit
from the Father and the Son, since we cannot even name the Father and
the Son without the Spirit? “For no one saith Lord Jesus, except in the
Holy Spirit?” <span id="fr_939"></span>[940](#fn_939) If, then, we
cannot call Jesus Lord except in the Holy Spirit, we certainly cannot
proclaim Him without the Spirit. But if the Angels also proclaim Jesus
to be Lord, Whom no one can proclaim except in the Spirit, then in them
also the office of the Holy Spirit operates.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xii-p22"></span>125. We have proved, then, that the
presence and the grace of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are
one, which is so heavenly and divine that the Son gives thanks therefore
to the Father, saying, “I give thanks to Thee, O Father, Lord of heaven
and earth, because Thou hast hidden these things from the wise and
prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.” <span

chiefly in the redemption of man. Their communion with man is also
one.](2100132)
