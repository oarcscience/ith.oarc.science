<span id="iv.i.iv.xvii"></span>

#### <span id="iv.i.iv.xvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVII.

<span id="iv.i.iv.xvii-p1"></span>With what virtuous feelings the
fathers of old hid the sacred fires when on the point of going into
captivity.

<span id="iv.i.iv.xvii-p2"></span>98. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.iv.xvii-p2.1"></span>Let</span> us consider, again, that deed
done at the time of the captivity, which has attained the highest degree
of virtue and glory. Virtue is checked by no adversities, for it rises
up among them, and prevails here rather than in prosperity. ’Mid chains
or arms, ’mid flames or slavery (which is harder for freemen to bear
than any punishment), ’midst the pains of the dying, the destruction of
their country, the fears of the living, or the blood of the
slain,—amidst all this our forefathers failed not in their care and
thought for what is virtuous. Amidst the ashes and dust of their fallen
country it glowed and shone forth brightly in pious efforts.

<span id="iv.i.iv.xvii-p3"></span>99. For when our fathers were carried
away into Persia, <span id="fr_710"></span>[711](#fn_710.md) certain
priests, who then were in the service of Almighty God, secretly buried
in the valley the fire taken from the altar of the Lord. There was there
an open pit, with no water in it, and not accessible for the wants of
the people, in a spot unknown and free from intruders. There they sealed
the hidden fire with the sacred mark and in secret. They were not
anxious to bury gold or to hide up silver to preserve it for their
children, but in their own great peril, thinking of all that was
virtuous, they thought the sacred fire ought to be preserved so that
impure men might not defile it, nor the blood of the slain extinguish
it, nor the heaps of miserable ruins cover it.

<span id="iv.i.iv.xvii-p5"></span>100. So they went to Persia, free only
in their religion; for that alone could not be torn from them by their
captivity. After a length of time, <span
id="fr_711"></span>[712](#fn_711.md) indeed, according to God’s good
pleasure, He put it into the Persian king’s heart to order the temple in
Judea to be restored, and the regular customs to be again rebuilt at
Jerusalem. To carry out this work of his the Persian king appointed
<span id="page_84">p. 84</span> <span
id="iv.i.iv.xvii-Page_84"></span>the priest Nehemiah. He took with him
the grandchildren of those priests who on leaving their native soil had
hidden the sacred fire to save it from perishing. But on arriving, as we
are told in the history of the fathers, they found not fire but water.
And when fire was wanting to burn upon the altars, the priest Nehemiah
bade them draw the water, to bring it to him, and to sprinkle it upon
the wood. Then, O wondrous sight! though the sky had been overcast with
clouds, suddenly the sun shone forth, a great fire flamed forth, so that
all, wonder-stricken at such a clear sign of the favour of the Lord,
were filled with joy. Nehemiah prayed; the priests sang a hymn of praise
to God, when the sacrifice was completed. Nehemiah again bade the
remainder of the water to be poured upon the larger stones. And when
this was done a flame burst forth whilst the light shining from off the
altar shone more brightly yet.

<span id="iv.i.iv.xvii-p7"></span>101. When this sign became known, the
king of Persia ordered a temple to be built on that spot where the fire
had been hidden and the water afterwards found, to which many gifts were
made. They who were with holy Nehemiah called it Naphthar, <span
id="fr_712"></span>[713](#fn_712.md) —which means cleansing—by many it is
called Nephi. It is to be found also in the history of the prophet
Jeremiah, <span id="fr_713"></span>[714](#fn_713.md) that he bade those who
should come after him to take of the fire. That is the fire which fell
on Moses’ sacrifice and consumed it, as it is written: “There came a
fire out from the Lord and consumed upon the altar all the whole
burnt-offering.” <span id="fr_714"></span>[715](#fn_714.md) The sacrifice
must be hallowed with this fire only. Therefore, also, fire went out
from the Lord upon the sons of Aaron who wished to offer strange fire,
and consumed them, so that their dead bodies were cast forth without the
camp. <span id="fr_715"></span>[716](#fn_715.md)

<span id="iv.i.iv.xvii-p12"></span>101. Jeremiah coming to a spot found
there a house like a cave, and brought into it the tabernacle, the ark,
and the altar of incense, and closed up the entrance. And when those who
had come with him examined it rather closely to mark the spot, they
could not discover nor find it. When Jeremiah understood what they
wanted he said: “The spot will remain unknown until God shall gather His
people together and be gracious to them. Then God shall reveal these
things and the majesty of the Lord shall appear.” <span

[Next: Chapter XVIII. In the narration of that event already mentioned,
and especially of the sacrifice offered by Nehemiah, is typified the
Holy Spirit and Christian baptism. The sacrifice of Moses and Elijah and
the history of Noah are also referred to the same.](2100112.md)
