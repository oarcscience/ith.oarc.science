<span id="iv.iv.iv.xvii"></span>

#### <span id="iv.iv.iv.xvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVI.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xvii-p1"></span>*St. Ambrose assures Gratian of
victory, declaring that it has been foretold in the prophecies of
Ezekiel. This hope is further stayed upon the emperor’s piety, the
former disasters being the punishment of Eastern heresy.* <span
id="fr_2088"></span>[2089](#fn_2088.md) *The book closes with a prayer to
God, that He will now show His mercy, and save the army, the land, and
the sovereign of the faithful.*

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xvii-p3"></span>136. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.iv.xvii-p3.1"></span>I must</span> no further detain your
Majesty, in this season of preparation for war, and the achievement of
victory over the Barbarians. Go forth, sheltered, indeed, under the
shield of faith, and girt with the sword of the Spirit; go forth to the
victory, promised of old time, and foretold in oracles given by God.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xvii-p4"></span>137. For Ezekiel, in those far-off
days, already prophesied the minishing of our people, and the Gothic
wars, saying: “Prophesy, therefore, Son of Man, and say: O Gog, thus
saith the Lord—Shalt thou not, in that day when My people Israel shall
be established to dwell in peace, rise up and come forth from thy place,
from the far north, and many nations with thee, all riders upon horses,
a great and mighty gathering, and the valour of many hosts? Yea, go up
against my people Israel, as clouds to cover the land, in the last
days.” <span id="fr_2089"></span>[2090](#fn_2089.md)

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xvii-p6"></span>138. That Gog is the Goth, whose
coming forth we have already seen, and over whom victory in days to come
is promised, according to the word of the Lord: “And they shall spoil
them, who had been their despoilers, and plunder them, who had carried
off their goods for a prey, saith the Lord. And it shall be in that day,
that I will give to Gog”—that is, to the Goths—“a place that is famous,
for Israel an high-heaped tomb of many men, of men who have made their
way to the sea, and it shall reach round about, and close the mouth of
the valley, and there \[the house of Israel shall\] overthrow Gog and
all his multitude, and it shall be called the valley of the multitude of
Gog: and the house of Israel shall overwhelm them, that the land may be
cleansed.” <span id="fr_2090"></span>[2091](#fn_2090.md)

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xvii-p8"></span>139. Nor, furthermore, may we doubt,
your sacred Majesty, that we, who have undertaken the contest with alien
unbelief, shall enjoy the aid of the Catholic Faith that is strong in
you. Plainly indeed the reason of God’s wrath has been already made
manifest, so that belief in the Roman Empire was first overthrown, where
faith in God gave way. <span id="fr_2091"></span>[2092](#fn_2091.md)

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xvii-p10"></span>140. No desire have I to recount the
deaths, tortures, and banishments of confessors, the offices of the
faithful made into presents for traitors. <span
id="fr_2092"></span>[2093](#fn_2092.md) Have we not heard, from all along
the border,—from Thrace, and through Dacia by the river, Mœsia, and all
Valeria of the Pannonians,—a mingled tumult of blasphemers preaching and
barbarians invading? What profit could neighbours so bloodthirsty bring
us, or how could the Roman State be safe with such defenders? <span
id="fr_2093"></span>[2094](#fn_2093.md)

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xvii-p13"></span><span id="page_242">p. 242</span>
<span id="iv.iv.iv.xvii-Page_242"></span>141. Enough, yea, more than
enough, Almighty God, have we now atoned for the deaths of confessors,
the banishment of priests, and the guilt of wickedness so overweening,
by our own blood, our own banishment—sufficiently plain is it that they,
who have broken faith, cannot be safe. Turn again, O Lord, and set up
the banners of Thy faith.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xvii-p14"></span>142. No military eagles, no flight
of birds, <span id="fr_2094"></span>[2095](#fn_2094.md) here lead the van
of our army, but Thy Name, Lord Jesus, and Thy worship. This is no land
of unbelievers, but the land whose custom it is to send forth
confessors—Italy; Italy, ofttimes tempted, but never drawn away; Italy,
which your Majesty hath long defended, and now again rescued from the
barbarian. No wavering mind in our emperor, but faith firm fixed.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xvii-p16"></span>143. Show forth now a plain sign of
Thy Majesty, that he who believes Thee to be the true Lord of Hosts, and
Captain of the armies of heaven; he who believes that Thou art the true
Power and Wisdom of God, no being of time nor of creation, but even as
it is written, the eternal Power and Divinity of God, <span
id="fr_2095"></span>[2096](#fn_2095.md) may, upheld by the aid of thy Might
Supreme, win the prize of victory for his Faith.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xvii-p2"></span> The disasters here alluded to are
the rout of the Roman army, in 378 <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.iv.xvii-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span>, at Hadrianople, and the
miserable death of the Emperor Valens, who took refuge in a hut, which
was surrounded and fired by the Goths, the emperor perishing in the
flames. This reverse was regarded by the orthodox as a judgment upon the
Arianism of Valens and others in high places.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xvii-p9"></span> The success of the Goths at
Hadrianople encouraged the northern barbarians to fresh invasions of the
empire, within which they from now began to form permanent lodgments,
and it correspondingly discouraged the subjects of the empire, and
sapped the old belief—a legacy from paganism—in the fortune of Rome.

<span id="fn_2092"></span>[241:2093](2100221.htm#fr_2092.md) <span
id="iv.iv.iv.xvii-p10.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xvii-p11"></span> Orthodox bishops and priests were
expelled from their sees and offices to make room for “betrayers of the
faith,” *i.e.* men who had apostatized to Arianism. The mingled tumult
of blasphemy and foreign onslaughts is a description of the condition of
the eastern provinces of the empire, where Arianism was rampant, and all
was overrun by the Goths. The latter was regarded by some as the result
of the former. Thus St. Jerome: “Our sins are the strength of the
barbarians, our vices bring defeat upon the arms of Rome.”—H. The
provinces here mentioned lay along the right bank of the Danube, and
took in what is now Lower Hungary, Servia, and Bulgaria. The result of
the disaster of Hadrianople was to put all these countries in the power
of the Goths.

<span id="fn_2093"></span>[241:2094](2100221.htm#fr_2093.md) <span
id="iv.iv.iv.xvii-p11.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xvii-p12"></span> The Goths had been driven in upon
the Roman frontiers by the inroads of the Huns, who expelled them from
their former habitations in S. & S. W. Russia. A treaty had been made
between them and the Emperor Valens, who agreed to take them under his
protection, but the bad faith with which the Goths soon found themselves
treated led to hostilities, and so to the great overthrow at Hadrianople
in 378.

<span id="fn_2094"></span>[242:2095](2100221.htm#fr_2094.md) <span
id="iv.iv.iv.xvii-p14.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xvii-p15"></span> No auguries—which were taken by
observing the flight of birds, as *omens* were by noting their voices.
These observances of course disappeared from the Roman army as soon as
the empire became Christian. In saying that the Name of the Saviour
leads the troops to war, St. Ambrose probably alludes to the Labarum or
banner emblazoned with the monogram <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iv.iv.xvii-p15.1"></span>Χρ,</span> which is composed of the two
first letters of the Name <span class="Greek"><span
