#### <span id="iv.ii.ii.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.v-p1"></span>The Holy Spirit is one and the same Who
spake in the prophets and apostles, Who is the Spirit of God and of
Christ; Whom, further, Scripture designates the Paraclete, and the
Spirit of life and truth.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.v-p2"></span>55. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.ii.ii.v-p2.1"></span>But</span> no one will doubt that the Spirit
is one, although very many have doubted whether God be one. For many
heretics have said that the God of the Old Testament is one, and the God
of the New Testament is another. But as the Father is one Who both spake
of old, as we read, to the fathers by the prophets, and to us in the
last days by His Son; <span id="fr_849"></span>[850](#fn_849.md) “and as
the Son is one, Who according to the tenour of the Old Testament was
offended by Adam, <span id="fr_850"></span>[851](#fn_850.md) seen by
Abraham, <span id="fr_851"></span>[852](#fn_851.md) worshipped by
Jacob; <span id="fr_852"></span>[853](#fn_852.md) so, too, the Holy Spirit
is one, who energized in the prophets, <span
id="fr_853"></span>[854](#fn_853.md) was breathed upon the apostles, <span
id="fr_854"></span>[855](#fn_854.md) and was joined to the Father and the
Son in the sacrament of baptism. <span id="fr_855"></span>[856](#fn_855.md)
For David says of Him: “And take not Thy Holy Spirit from me.” <span
id="fr_856"></span>[857](#fn_856.md) And in another place he said of Him:
“Whither shall I go from Thy Spirit?” <span
id="fr_857"></span>[858](#fn_857.md)

<span id="iv.ii.ii.v-p12"></span><span id="page_101">p. 101</span> <span
id="iv.ii.ii.v-Page_101"></span>56. That you may know that the Spirit of
God is the same as the Holy Spirit, as we read also in the Apostle: “No
one speaking in the Spirit of God says Anathema to Jesus and no one can
say, Lord Jesus, but in the Holy Spirit,” <span
id="fr_858"></span>[859](#fn_858.md) the Apostle calls Him the Spirit of
God. He called Him also the Spirit of Christ, as you read: “But ye are
not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God
dwelleth in you.” <span id="fr_859"></span>[860](#fn_859.md) And farther
on: “But if the Spirit of Him Who raised Jesus from the dead dwelleth in
you.” <span id="fr_860"></span>[861](#fn_860.md) The same is, then, the
Spirit of God, Who is the Spirit of Christ.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.v-p16"></span>57. The same is also the Spirit of
Life, as the Apostle says: “For the law of the Spirit of Life in Christ
Jesus hath delivered me from the law of sin and death.” <span
id="fr_861"></span>[862](#fn_861.md)

<span id="iv.ii.ii.v-p18"></span>58. Him, then, Whom the Apostle called
the Spirit of Life, the Lord in the Gospel named the Paraclete, and the
Spirit of Truth, as you find: “And I will ask the Father, and He will
give you another Comforter \[Paraclete\], that He may be with you for
ever, even the Spirit of Truth, Whom this world cannot receive; because
it seeth Him not, neither knoweth Him.” <span
id="fr_862"></span>[863](#fn_862.md) You have, then, the Paraclete Spirit,
called also the Spirit of Truth, and the invisible Spirit. How, then, do
some think that the Son is visible in His Divine Nature, when the world
cannot see even the Spirit?

<span id="iv.ii.ii.v-p20"></span>59. Receive now the saying of the Lord,
that the same is the Holy Spirit Who is the Spirit of Truth, for you
read in the end of this book: “Receive the Holy Spirit.” <span
id="fr_863"></span>[864](#fn_863.md) And Peter teaches that the same is the
Holy Spirit Who is the Spirit of the Lord, when he says: “Ananias, why
has it seemed good to thee to tempt and to lie to the Holy
Spirit?” <span id="fr_864"></span>[865](#fn_864.md) And immediately after
he says again to the wife of Ananias: “Why has it seemed good to you to
tempt the Spirit of the Lord?” <span id="fr_865"></span>[866](#fn_865.md)
When he says “to you,” he shows that he is speaking of the same Spirit
of Whom he had spoken to Ananias. He Himself is, then, the Spirit of the
Lord Who is the Holy Spirit.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.v-p24"></span>60. And the Lord Himself made clear
that the same Who is the Spirit of the Father is the Holy Spirit, when
according to Matthew He said that we ought not to take thought in
persecution what we should say: “For it is not ye that speak, but the
Spirit of your Father that speaketh in you.” <span
id="fr_866"></span>[867](#fn_866.md) Again He says according to St. Luke:
“Be not anxious how ye shall answer or speak, for the Holy Spirit of God
shall teach you in that hour what ye ought to say.” <span
id="fr_867"></span>[868](#fn_867.md) So, although many are called spirits,
as it is said: “Who maketh His Angels spirits,” yet the Spirit of God is
but one.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.v-p27"></span>61. Both apostles and prophets received
that one Spirit, as the vessel of election, the Doctor of the Gentiles,
says: “For we have all drunk of one Spirit;” <span
id="fr_868"></span>[869](#fn_868.md) Him, as it were, Who cannot be
divided, but is poured into souls, and flows into the senses, that He
may quench the burning of this world’s thirst.

[Next: Chapter V. The Holy Spirit, since He sanctifies creatures, is
neither a creature nor subject to change. He is always good, since He is
given by the Father and the Son; neither is He to be numbered amongst
such things as are said to fail. He must be acknowledged as the source
of goodness. The Spirit of God's mouth, the amender of evils, and
Himself good. Lastly, as He is said in Scripture to be good, and is
joined to the Father and the Son in baptism, He cannot possibly be
denied to be good. He is not, however, said to progress, but to be made
perfect in goodness, which distinguishes Him from all
creatures.](2100125.md)
