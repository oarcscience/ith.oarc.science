<span id="iv.vi.ii.i"></span>

#### <span id="iv.vi.ii.i-p0.1"></span>Chapter I.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.i-p1"></span>St. Ambrose writes in praise of
gentleness, pointing out how needful that grace is for the rulers of the
Church, and commended to them by the meekness of Christ. As the
Novatians have fallen away from this, they cannot be considered
disciples of Christ. Their pride and harshness are inveighed against.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.i-p2"></span>1. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.i-p2.1"></span>If</span> the highest end of virtue is that
which aims at the advancement of most, gentleness is the most lovely of
all, which does not hurt even those whom it condemns, and usually
renders those whom it condemns worthy of absolution. Moreover, it is the
only virtue which has led to the increase of the Church which the Lord
sought at the price of His own Blood, imitating the lovingkindness of
heaven, and aiming at the redemption of all, seeks this end with a
gentleness which the ears of men can endure, in presence of which their
hearts do not sink, nor their spirits quail.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.i-p3"></span>2. For he who endeavours to amend the
faults of human weakness ought to bear this very weakness on his own
shoulders, let it weigh upon himself, not cast it off. For we read that
the Shepherd in the Gospel <span id="fr_2909"></span>[2910](#fn_2909)
carried the weary sheep, and did not cast it off. And Solomon says: “Be
not overmuch righteous;” <span id="fr_2910"></span>[2911](#fn_2910) for
restraint should temper righteousness. For how shall he offer himself to
you for healing whom you despise, who thinks that he will be an object
of contempt, not of compassion, to his physician?

<span id="iv.vi.ii.i-p6"></span>3. Therefore had the Lord Jesus
compassion upon us in order to call us to Himself, not frighten us away.
He came in meekness, He came in humility, and so He said: “Come unto Me,
all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will refresh you.” <span
id="fr_2911"></span>[2912](#fn_2911) So, then, the Lord Jesus refreshes,
and does not shut out nor cast off, and fitly chose such disciples as
should be interpreters of the Lord’s will, as should gather together and
not drive away the people of God. Whence it is clear that they are not
to be counted amongst the disciples of Christ, who think that harsh and
proud opinions should be followed rather than such as are gentle and
meek; persons who, while they themselves seek God’s mercy, deny it to
others, such as are the teachers of the Novatians, who call themselves
pure. <span id="fr_2912"></span>[2913](#fn_2912)

<span id="iv.vi.ii.i-p9"></span>4. What can show more pride than this,
since the Scripture says: “No one is free from sin, not even an infant
of a day old;” <span id="fr_2913"></span>[2914](#fn_2913) and David
cries out: “Cleanse me from my sin.” <span
id="fr_2914"></span>[2915](#fn_2914) Are they more holy than David, of
whose family Christ vouchsafed to be born in the mystery of the
Incarnation, whose descendant is that heavenly Hall which received the
world’s Redeemer in her virgin womb? For what is more harsh than to
inflict a penance which they do not relax, and by refusing pardon to
take away the incentive to penance and repentance? <span
id="fr_2915"></span>[2916](#fn_2915) Now no one can repent to good
purpose unless he hopes for mercy.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.i-p12"></span> It is necessary to vary the
translation of the word *pœnitentia* in this place, as it bears the
meaning both of “penance,” the temporal punishment inflicted on the
sinner, and also of “repentance.”

[Next: Chapter II. The assertion of the Novatians that they refuse
communion only to the lapsed agrees neither with the teaching of holy
Scripture nor with their own. And whereas they allege as a pretext their
reverence for the divine power, they really are contemning it, inasmuch
as it is a sign of low estimation not to use the whole of a power
entrusted to one. But the Church rightly claims the power of binding and
loosing, which heretics have not, inasmuch as she has received it from
the Holy Spirit, against Whom they act presumptuously.](2100289)
