#### <span id="iv.i.iii.xiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIV.

<span id="iv.i.iii.xiv-p1"></span>Prudence is combined with all the
virtues, especially with contempt of riches.

<span id="iv.i.iii.xiv-p2"></span>66. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.iii.xiv-p2.1"></span>Prudence</span>, therefore, works through
all things, she has fellowship with all that is good. For how <span
id="fr_476"></span>[477](#fn_476.md) can she give good advice unless she
have justice too, so that she may clothe herself in consistency, not
fear death, be held back by no alarm, no fear, nor think it right to be
turned aside from the truth by any flattery, nor shun exile, knowing
that the world is the fatherland of the wise man. She fears not want,
for she knows that nothing is wanting to the wise man, since the whole
world of riches is his. What is greater than the man that knows not how
to be excited at the thought of money, and has a contempt for riches,
and looks down as from some lofty vantage-ground on the desires of men?
Men think that one who acts thus is more than man: “Who is this,” it
says, “and we will praise him. For wonderful things hath he done in his
life.” <span id="fr_477"></span>[478](#fn_477.md) Surely he ought to be
admired who despises riches, seeing that most place them even before
their own safety.

<span id="iv.i.iii.xiv-p5"></span>67. The rule of economy and the
authority of self-restraint befits all, and most of all him who stands
highest in honour; so that no love for his treasures may seize upon such
a man, and that he who rules over free men may never become a slave to
money. It is more seemly that in soul he should be superior to
treasures, and in willing service be subject to his friends. For
humility in<span id="page_54">p. 54</span> <span
id="iv.i.iii.xiv-Page_54"></span>creases the regard in which one is
held. It is praiseworthy and right for the chief of men to have no
desire for filthy lucre in common with Syrian traders and Gilead
merchants, nor to place all their hope of good in money, or to count up
their daily gains and to calculate their savings like a hireling.
