#### <span id="iv.iv.iv.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.iv-p1"></span>Forasmuch as God is One, the Son of God
is God, good and true.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.iv-p2"></span>33. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.iv.iv-p2.1"></span>Yet</span> what think ye, who deny the
goodness and true Godhead of the Son of God, though it is written that
there is no God but One? <span id="fr_1939"></span>[1940](#fn_1939) For
although there be gods so-called, would you reckon Christ amongst them
which are called gods, but are not, seeing that eternity is of His
Essence, and that beside Him there is none other that is good and true
God, forasmuch as God is in Him; <span
id="fr_1940"></span>[1941](#fn_1940) whilst it follows from the very
nature of the Father, that after Him there is no other true God, because
God is One, neither confounding \[the Persons of\] the Father and Son,
as the Sabellians do, nor, like the Arians, severing the Father and the
Son. For the Father and the Son, as Father and Son, are distinct
persons, but they admit no division of their Godhead.
