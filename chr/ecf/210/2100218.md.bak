#### <span id="iv.iv.iv.xiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIII.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xiv-p1"></span>The wicked and dishonourable opinions
held by Arians, Sabellians, and Manichæans as concerning their Judge are
shortly refuted. Christ’s remonstrances regarding the rest of His
adversaries being set forth, St. Ambrose expresses a hope of milder
judgment for himself.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xiv-p2"></span>108. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.iv.xiv-p2.1"></span>Let</span> us proceed, then, with your
accusations, and see how you gain the favour of your Judge. Speak now,
speak, I say, and tell Him: “I consider Thee, O Christ, to be unlike Thy
Father;” and He will answer: “Mark, if thou canst, mark, I say, and tell
Me wherein thou holdest Me to differ.”

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xiv-p3"></span>109. Say again: “I judge Thee to be a
created being;” and Christ will reply: “If the witness of two men is
true, oughtest thou not to have believed both Me and My Father, Who hath
called Me His Son?”

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xiv-p4"></span>110. Then you will say: “I deny Thy
\[perfect\] goodness;” and He will answer: “Be it unto thee according to
thy faith; so will I not be good to thee.”

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xiv-p5"></span>111. “That Thou art Almighty, I hold
not;” and He will answer, in turn: “Then can I not forgive thee thy
sins.”

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xiv-p6"></span>112. “Thou art a subject being.”
Whereto He will reply: “Why, then, dost thou seek freedom and pardon of
Him Whom thou thinkest to be subject as a slave?”

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xiv-p7"></span>113. I see your accusation halt here.
I press you not, forasmuch as I myself know my own sins. I grudge you
not pardon, for I myself would obtain indulgence, but I would know the
object of your prayers. Look, then, whilst I recite before the Judge
your desires. I betray not your sins, but look to behold your prayers
and wishes set forth in their order.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xiv-p8"></span>114. Speak, therefore, those desires,
which all alike would have granted to them. “Lord, make me in the image
of God.” Whereto He will answer: “In what image? The image which thou
hast denied?”

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xiv-p9"></span>115. “Make me incorruptible.” Surely
His reply will be: “How can I make thee incorruptible, I, Whom thou
callest a created being, and so wouldst make out to be corruptible? The
dead shall rise purified from corruption—dost thou call Him corruptible
Whom thou seest to be God?”

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xiv-p10"></span>116. “Be good to me.” “Why dost thou
ask what thou hast denied \[to Me\]? I would have had thee to be good,
and I said ‘Be ye holy, for I Myself am holy,’ <span
id="fr_2057"></span>[2058](#fn_2057.md) <span id="page_239">p. 239</span>
<span id="iv.iv.iv.xiv-Page_239"></span>and thou settest thyself to deny
that I am good? Dost *thou* then look for forgiveness of sins? Nay, none
can forgive sins, but God alone. <span
id="fr_2058"></span>[2059](#fn_2058.md) Seeing, then, that to thee I am not
the true and only God, I cannot by any means forgive thee thy sins.”

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xiv-p13"></span>117. Thus let the followers of Arius
and Photinus speak. “I deny Thy Godhead.” To whom the Lord will make
answer: “‘The fool hath said in his heart: There is no God’ <span
id="fr_2059"></span>[2060](#fn_2059.md) Of whom, think you, is this
said?—of Jew or Gentile, or of the devil. Whosoever he be of whom it is
said, O disciple of Photinus, he is more to be borne with, who held his
peace; <span id="fr_2060"></span>[2061](#fn_2060.md) thou, nevertheless,
hast dared to lift up thy voice to utter it, that thou mightest be
proved more foolish than the fool. Thou deniest My Godhead, whereas I
said, ‘Ye are gods, and ye are all the children of the Most
Highest?’ <span id="fr_2061"></span>[2062](#fn_2061.md) And thou deniest
Him to be God, Whose godlike works thou seest around thee.”

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xiv-p17"></span>118. Let the Sabellian speak in his
turn. “I consider Thee, by Thyself, to be at once Father and Son and
Holy Spirit.” To whom the Lord: “Thou hearest neither the Father nor the
Son. Is there any doubt on this matter? The Scripture itself teaches
thee that it is the Father Who giveth over the judgment, and the Son Who
judges. <span id="fr_2062"></span>[2063](#fn_2062.md) Thou hast not given
ear to My words: ‘I am not alone, but I and the Father, Who sent
Me.’” <span id="fr_2063"></span>[2064](#fn_2063.md)

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xiv-p20"></span>119. Now let the Manichæan have his
word. “I hold that the devil is the creator of our flesh.” The Lord will
answer him: “What, then, doest thou in the heavenly places? Depart, go
thy way to thy creator. ‘My will is that they be with Me, whom my Father
hath given Me.’ <span id="fr_2064"></span>[2065](#fn_2064.md) Thou,
Manichæan, holdest thyself for a creature of the devil; hasten, then, to
his abode, the place of fire and brimstone, where the fire thereof is
not quenched, lest ever the punishment have an end.”

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xiv-p22"></span>120. I set aside other heretical—not
persons, but portents. What manner of judgment awaits them, what shall
be the form of their sentence? To all these He will, indeed, reply,
rather in sorrow than in anger: “O My people, what have I done unto
thee, wherein have I vexed thee? Did I not bring thee up out of Egypt,
and lead thee out of the house of bondage into liberty?” <span
id="fr_2065"></span>[2066](#fn_2065.md)

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xiv-p24"></span>121. But it is not enough to have
brought us out of Egypt into freedom, and to have saved us from the
house of bondage: a greater boon than this, Thou hast given Thyself for
us. Thou wilt say then: “Have I not borne all your sufferings? <span
id="fr_2066"></span>[2067](#fn_2066.md) Have I not given My Body for you?
Have I not sought death, which had no part in My Godhead, but was
necessary for your redemption? Are *these* the thanks I am to receive?
Is it this that My Blood hath gained, even as I spake in times past by
the mouth of the prophet: ‘What profit is there in My Blood, for that I
have gone down to corruption?’ <span
id="fr_2067"></span>[2068](#fn_2067.md) Is this the profit, that you should
wickedly deny Me—you, for whom I endured those things?”

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xiv-p27"></span>122. As for me, Lord Jesu, though I
am conscious within myself of great sin, yet will I say: “I have not
denied Thee; Thou mayest pardon the infirmity of my flesh. My
transgression I confess; my sin I deny not. <span
id="fr_2068"></span>[2069](#fn_2068.md) If Thou wilt Thou canst make me
clean. <span id="fr_2069"></span>[2070](#fn_2069.md) For this saying, the
leper obtained his request. Enter not, I pray, into judgment with Thy
servant. <span id="fr_2070"></span>[2071](#fn_2070.md) I ask, not that Thou
mayest judge, but that Thou mayest forgive.”

id="iv.iv.iv.xiv-p14.1"></span>. These words mean, not so much that a
man says “There is no God” because he is a fool, because he is wanting
in intelligence, but rather that when a man has left off to behave
himself wisely and to do good—*i.e.* does foolishly, that is to say,
*wickedly*—it is because he has said in his heart, “There is no God.”
