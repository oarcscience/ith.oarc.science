#### <span id="iv.iv.iii.xvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVI.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xvii-p1"></span>The Arians blaspheme Christ, if by
the words “created” and “begotten” they mean and understand one and the
same thing. If, however, they regard the words as distinct in meaning,
they must not speak of Him, of Whom they have read that He was begotten,
as if He were a created being. This rule is upheld by the witness of St.
Paul, who, professing himself a servant of Christ, forbade worship of a
created being. God being a substance pure and uncompounded, there is no
created nature in Him; furthermore, the Son is not to be degraded to the
level of things created, seeing that in Him the Father is well pleased.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xvii-p2"></span>100. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.iii.xvii-p2.1"></span>Now</span> will I enquire particularly
of the Arians, whether they think that begotten and created are one and
the same. If they call them the same, then is there no difference
betwixt generation and creation. It follows, then, that forasmuch as we
also are created, there is between us and Christ and the elements no
difference. Thus much, however, great as their madness is, they will not
venture to say.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xvii-p3"></span>101. Furthermore—to concede that
which is no truth, to their folly—I ask them, if there is, as they
think, no difference in the words, why do they not call upon Him Whom
they worship by the better title? Why do they not avail themselves of
the Father’s word? <span id="fr_1849"></span>[1850](#fn_1849.md) Why do
they reject the title of honour, and use a dishonouring name?

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xvii-p5"></span>102. If, however, there is—as I
think there is—a distinction between “created” and “begotten,” then,
when we have read that He is begotten, we shall surely not understand
the same by the terms “begotten” and “created.” Let them therefore
confess Him to be begotten of the Father, born of the Virgin, or let
them say how the Son of God can be both begotten and created. A single
nature, above all, the Divine Being, rejects strife (within itself).

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xvii-p6"></span>103. But in any case let our private
judgment pass: let us enquire of Paul, who, filled with the Spirit of
God, and so foreseeing these questionings, hath given sentence against
pagans in general and Arians in particular, saying that they were by
God’s judgment condemned, who served the creature rather than the
Creator. Thus, in fact, you may read: “God gave them over to the lusts
of their own heart, that they might one with another dishonour their
bodies, they who changed God’s truth into a lie, and worshipped and
served the thing created rather than the Creator, Who is God, blessed
for ever.” <span id="fr_1850"></span>[1851](#fn_1850.md)

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xvii-p8"></span>104. Thus Paul forbids me to worship
a creature, and admonishes me of my duty to serve Christ. It follows,
then, that Christ is not a created being. The Apostle calls himself
“Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ,” <span
id="fr_1851"></span>[1852](#fn_1851.md) and this good servant, who
acknowledges his Lord, will likewise have us not worship that which is
created. How, then, could he have been himself a servant of Christ, if
he thought that Christ was a created person? Let these heretics, then,
cease either to worship Him Whom they call a created being, or to call
Him a creature, Whom they feign to worship, lest under colour of being
worshippers they fall into worse impiety. For a domestic is worse than a
foreign foe, and that these men should use the Name of Christ to
Christ’s dishonour increaseth their guilt.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xvii-p10"></span>105. What better expounder of the
Scriptures do we indeed look for than that teacher of the Gentiles, that
chosen vessel—chosen from the number of the persecutors? He who had been
the persecutor of Christ confesses Him. He had read Solomon more, in any
case, than Arius hath, and he was well learned in the Law, and so,
because he had read, he said not that Christ was created, but that He
was begotten. For he had read, “He spake, and they were made: He
commanded, and they were created.” <span
id="fr_1852"></span>[1853](#fn_1852.md) Was Christ, I ask, made at a word?
Was He created at a command?

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xvii-p12"></span>106. Moreover, *how* can there be
any created nature in God? In truth, God is of an uncompounded nature;
nothing can be added to Him, and that alone which is Divine hath He in
His nature; filling all things, <span
id="fr_1853"></span>[1854](#fn_1853.md) yet nowhere Himself confounded with
aught; penetrating all things, yet Himself nowhere to be penetrated;
present in all His fulness at one and the same moment, in heaven, in
earth, in the deepest depth of the sea, <span
id="fr_1854"></span>[1855](#fn_1854.md) to sight invisible, by speech not
to be declared, by feeling not to be measured; to be followed by faith,
to be adored with devotion; so that whatsoever title excels in depth of
spiritual import, in setting forth glory and honour, in exalting power,
this you may know to belong of right to God.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xvii-p15"></span>107. Since, then, the Father is
well pleased in the Son; believe that the Son is worthy of the Father,
that He came out from God, as He Himself bears witness, saying: “I went
out from God, and am come;” <span id="fr_1855"></span>[1856](#fn_1855.md)
and again: “I went out from God.” <span
id="fr_1856"></span>[1857](#fn_1856.md) He Who proceeded and came forth
<span id="page_219">p. 219</span> <span
id="iv.iv.iii.xvii-Page_219"></span>from God can have no attributes but
such as are proper to God.

[Next: Chapter XVII. That Christ is very God is proved from the fact
that He is God's own Son, also from His having been begotten and having
come forth from God, and further, from the unity of will and operation
subsisting in Father and Son. The witness of the apostles and of the
centurion--which St. Ambrose sets over against the Arian teaching--is
adduced, together with that of Isaiah and St. John.](2100200.md)
