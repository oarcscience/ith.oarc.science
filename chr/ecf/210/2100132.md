#### <span id="iv.ii.ii.xiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XII.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xiii-p1"></span>The peace and grace of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit are one, so also is Their charity one,
which showed itself chiefly in the redemption of man. Their communion
with man is also one.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xiii-p2"></span>126. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.ii.ii.xiii-p2.1"></span>Therefore</span> since the calling is
one, the grace is also one. Lastly, it is written: “Grace unto you and
peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.” <span
id="fr_941"></span>[942](#fn_941) You see, then, that we are told that
the grace of the Father and the Son is one, and the peace of the Father
and the Son is one, but this grace and peace is the fruit of the Spirit,
as the Apostle taught us himself, saying: “But the fruit of the Spirit
is love, joy, peace, patience.” <span id="fr_942"></span>[943](#fn_942)
And peace is good and necessary that no one be troubled with doubtful
disputations, nor be shaken by the storm of bodily passions, but that
his affections may remain quietly disposed as to the worship of God,
with simplicity of faith and tranquillity of mind.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xiii-p5"></span>127. As to peace we have proved the
point; but as to grace the prophet Zechariah says, that God promised to
pour upon Jerusalem the spirit of grace and mercy, <span
id="fr_943"></span>[944](#fn_943) and the Apostle Peter says: “Repent
and be baptized every one of you in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ
for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the grace of the Holy
Spirit.” <span id="fr_944"></span>[945](#fn_944) So grace comes also of
the Holy Spirit as of the Father and the Son. For how can there be grace
without the Spirit, since all divine grace is in the Spirit?

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xiii-p8"></span>128. Nor do we read only of the peace
and grace of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, but also,
faithful Emperor, of the love and communion. For of love it has been
said: “The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God.” <span
id="fr_945"></span>[946](#fn_945) We have heard of the love of the
Father. The same love which is the Father’s is also the Son’s. For He
Himself said: “He that loveth Me shall be loved of My Father, and I will
love him.” <span id="fr_946"></span>[947](#fn_946) And what is the love
of the Son, but that He offered Himself for us, and redeemed us with His
own blood. <span id="fr_947"></span>[948](#fn_947) But the same love is
in the Father, for it is written: “God so loved the world, that He gave
His Only-begotten Son.” <span id="fr_948"></span>[949](#fn_948)

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xiii-p13"></span>129. So, then, the Father gave the
Son, and the Son gave Himself. Love is preserved and due affection is
not wronged, for affection is not wronged where there is no distress in
the giving up. He gave one Who was willing, He gave One Who offered
Himself, the Father did not give the Son to punishment but to grace. If
you enquire into the merit of the deed, enquire into the description of
the affection. The vessel of election shows plainly the unity of this
divine love, because both the Father gave the Son and the Son gave
Himself. The Father gave, Who “spared not His own Son, but gave Him up
for us all.” <span id="fr_949"></span>[950](#fn_949) And of the Son he
also says: “Who gave Himself for me.” <span
id="fr_950"></span>[951](#fn_950) “Gave Himself,” he says. If it be of
grace, what do I find fault with. If it be that He suffered wrong, I owe
the more.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xiii-p16"></span>130. But learn that in like manner
as the Father gave the Son, and the Son gave Himself, so, too, the Holy
Spirit gave Him. For it is written: “Then was Jesus led by the Spirit
into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.” <span
id="fr_951"></span>[952](#fn_951) So, too, the loving Spirit gave the
Son of God. For as the love of the Father and the Son is one, so, too,
we have shown that this love of God is shed abroad by the Holy Spirit,
and is the fruit of the Holy Spirit, because “the fruit of the Spirit is
love, joy, peace, patience.” <span id="fr_952"></span>[953](#fn_952)

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xiii-p19"></span>131. And that there is communion
between the Father and the Son is plain, for it is written: “And our
communion is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ.” <span
id="fr_953"></span>[954](#fn_953) And in another place: “The communion
of the Holy Spirit be with you all.” <span
id="fr_954"></span>[955](#fn_954) If, then, the peace of the Father, the
Son, and the Holy Spirit is one, the grace one, the love one, and the
communion one, the working is certainly one, and where the working is
one, certainly the power cannot be divided nor the substance separated.
For, if so, how could the grace of the same working agree?
