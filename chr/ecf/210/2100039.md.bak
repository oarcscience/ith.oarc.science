#### <span id="iv.i.ii.xxvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXVII.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxvii-p1"></span>The first source of duty is prudence,
from whence spring three other virtues; and they cannot be separated or
torn asunder, since they are mutually connected one with the other.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxvii-p2"></span>126. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.ii.xxvii-p2.1"></span>The</span> first source of duty, then, is
prudence. <span id="fr_184"></span>[185](#fn_184.md) For what is more of a
duty than to give to the Creator all one’s devotion and reverence? This
source, however, is drawn off into other virtues. For justice cannot
exist without prudence, since it demands no small amount of prudence to
see whether a thing is just or unjust. A mistake on either side is very
serious. “For he that says a just man is unjust, or an unjust man is
just, is accursed with God. Wherefore does justice <span
id="fr_185"></span>[186](#fn_185.md) abound unto the wicked?” <span
id="fr_186"></span>[187](#fn_186.md) says Solomon. Nor, on the other hand,
can prudence exist without justice, for piety towards God is the
beginning of understanding. On which we notice that this is a borrowed
rather than an original idea among the worldly wise, for piety is the
foundation of all virtues.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxvii-p6"></span>127. But the piety of justice <span
id="fr_187"></span>[188](#fn_187.md) is first directed towards God;
secondly, towards one’s country; next, towards parents; <span
id="fr_188"></span>[189](#fn_188.md) lastly, towards all. This, too, is in
accordance with the guidance of nature. From the beginning of life, when
understanding first begins to be infused into us, we love life as the
gift of God, we love our country and our parents; lastly, our
companions, with whom we like to associate. Hence arises true love,
which prefers others to self, and seeks not its own, wherein lies the
pre-eminence of justice.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxvii-p9"></span>128. It is ingrained in all living
creatures, <span id="fr_189"></span>[190](#fn_189.md) first of all, to
preserve their own safety, to guard against what is harmful, to strive
for what is advantageous. They seek food and converts, whereby they may
protect themselves from dangers, storms, and sun,—all which is a mark of
prudence. Next we find that all the different creatures are by nature
wont to herd together, at first with fellows of their own class and
sort, then also with others. So we see oxen delighted to be in herds,
horses in droves, and especially like with like, stags, also, in company
with stags and often with men. And what should I say on their desire to
have young, and on their offspring, or even on their passions, wherein
the likeness of justice is conspicuous?

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxvii-p11"></span>129. It is clear, then, that these
and the remaining virtues are related to one another. For courage, which
in war preserves one’s country from the barbarians, or at home defends
the weak, or comrades from robbers, is full of justice; and to know on
what plan to defend and to give help, how to make use of opportunities
of time and place, is the part of prudence and moderation, and
temperance itself cannot observe due measure without prudence. To know a
fit opportunity, and to make return according to what is right, belongs
to justice. In all these, too, large-heartedness is necessary, and
fortitude of mind, and often of body, so that we may carry out what we
wish.

parts of the former, revenge and private possession, are not recognized
by Christians. What the Stoics say about common property and mutual help
has been borrowed from the sacred writings. The greatness of the glory
of justice, and what hinders access to it.](2100040.md)
