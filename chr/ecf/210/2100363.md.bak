### <span id="iv.viii.xv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIV.

<span id="iv.viii.xv-p1"></span>Though a widow may have received no
commandment, yet she has received so many counsels that she ought not to
think little of them. St. Ambrose would be sorry to lay any snare for
her, seeing that the field of the Church grows richer as a result of
wedlock, but it is absolutely impossible to deny that widowhood, which
St. Paul praises, is profitable. Consequently, he speaks severely about
those who have proscribed widowhood by law.

<span id="iv.viii.xv-p2"></span>82. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.viii.xv-p2.1"></span>But</span> neither has the widow received
any command, but a counsel; a counsel, however, not given once only but
often repeated. For, first, it is said: “It is good for a man not to
touch a woman.” <span id="fr_3398"></span>[3399](#fn_3398.md) And again: “I
would that all men were even as I myself;” <span
id="fr_3399"></span>[3400](#fn_3399.md) and once more: “It is good for them
if they remain even as I;” <span id="fr_3400"></span>[3401](#fn_3400.md)
and a fourth time: “It is good for the present distress.” <span
id="fr_3401"></span>[3402](#fn_3401.md) And that it is well pleasing to the
Lord, and honourable, and, lastly, that perseverance in widowhood is
happier, he lays down not only as his own judgment, but also as an
aspiration of the Holy Spirit. Who, then, can reject the kindness of
such a counsellor? Who gives the reins to the will, and advises in the
case of others that which he has found advantageous by his own
experience, he who is not easy to catch up, and is not hurt at being
equalled. Who, then, would shrink from becoming holy in body and spirit,
since the reward is far above the toil, grace beyond need, and the wages
above the work?

<span id="iv.viii.xv-p7"></span>83. And this, I say, not in order to lay
a snare for others, but that as a good husbandman of the land entrusted
to me, I may see this field of the Church to be fruitful, at one time
blossoming with the flowers of purity, at another time strong in the
gravity of widowhood, and yet again abounding with the fruits of
wedlock. For though they be diverse, yet they are the fruits of one
field; there are not so many lilies in the gardens as ears of corn in
the fields, and many more fields are prepared for receiving seed than
lie fallow after the crops are gathered in.

<span id="iv.viii.xv-p8"></span>84. Widowhood is, then, good, which is
so often praised by the judgment of the apostles, for it is a teacher of
the faith <span id="page_406">p. 406</span> <span
id="iv.viii.xv-Page_406"></span>and a teacher of chastity. Whereas they
who honour the adulteries and the shame of their gods appointed
penalties for celibacy and widowhood; <span
id="fr_3402"></span>[3403](#fn_3402.md) that zealous in pursuit of crimes
they might punish the study of virtues; under the pretext, indeed, of
seeking increase of the population, but in reality that they might put
an end to the purpose of chastity. For the soldier, when his time is
ended, lays aside his arms, and leaving the rank which he held, is
dismissed as a veteran to his own land, that he may obtain rest after
the toils of a laborious life, and cause others to be more ready to
undergo labour in the hope of future repose. The labourer, too, as he
grows too old, entrusts the guiding of the plough to others, and worn
out by the toil of his youth, enjoys in his old age that which his
foresight has cared for, still ready to prune the vine rather than to
press the grapes, so as to check the luxuriance of early life, and to
cut off with his pruning knife the wantonness of youth, teaching, as it
were, that blessed fruitfulness is to be aimed at even in the vine.

<span id="iv.viii.xv-p10"></span>85. In like manner the widow, as a
veteran, having served her time, though she lays aside the arms of
married life, yet orders the peace of the whole house: though now freed
from carrying burdens, she is yet watchful for the younger who are to be
married; and with the thoughtfulness of old age she arranges where more
pains would be profitable, where produce would be more abundant, which
is fitted for the marriage bond. And so, if the field is entrusted to
the elder rather than to the younger, why should you think that it is
more advantageous to be a married woman than a widow? But, if the
persecutors of the faith have also been the persecutors of widowhood,
most certainly by those who hold the faith, widowhood is not to be
shunned as a penalty, but to be esteemed as a reward.

<span id="iv.viii.xv-p9"></span> The reference would seem to be to the
“*Lex Julia et Papia Poppæa,*” but the object of this law was not, as
St. Ambrose seems to imply, to check celibacy, but to meet the growing
licentiousness of the age, which avoided the obligations of married life
while indulging in every kind of impure abominations.

[Next: Chapter XV. St. Ambrose meets the objection of those who make the
desire of having children an excuse for second marriage, and especially
in the case of those who have children of their former marriage; and
points out the consequent troubles of disagreements amongst the
children, and even between the married persons, and gives a warning
against a wrong use of Scripture instances in this matter.](2100364.md)
