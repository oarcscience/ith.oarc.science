#### <span id="iv.ii.ii.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.iv-p1"></span>The statement of the Apostle, that all
things are of the Father by the Son, does not separate the Spirit from
Their company, since what is referred to one Person is also attributed
to each. So those baptized in the Name of Christ are held to be baptized
in the Name of the Father and of the Holy Spirit, if, that is, there is
belief in the Three Persons, otherwise the baptism will be null. This
also applies to baptism in the Name of the Holy Spirit. If because of
one passage the Holy Spirit is separated from the Father and the Son, it
will necessarily follow from other passages that the Father will be
subordinated to the Son. The Son is worshipped by angels, not by the
Spirit, for the latter is His witness, not His servant. Where the Son is
spoken of as being before all, it is to be understood of creatures. The
great dignity of the Holy Spirit is proved by the absence of forgiveness
for the sin against Him. How it is that such sin cannot be forgiven, and
how the Spirit is one.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.iv-p2"></span>32. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.ii.ii.iv-p2.1"></span>But</span> perhaps some one may say that
there was a reason why the writer said that all things were of the
Father, and all things through the Son, <span
id="fr_828"></span>[829](#fn_828.md) but made no mention of the Holy
Spirit, and would obtain the foundation of an argument from this. But if
he persists in his perverse interpretation, in how many passages will he
find the power of the Holy Spirit asserted, in which Scripture has
stated nothing concerning either the Father or the Son, but has left it
to be understood?

<span id="iv.ii.ii.iv-p4"></span>40. Where, then, the grace of the
Spirit is asserted, is that of God the Father or of the Only-begotten
Son denied? By no means; for as the Father is in the Son, and the Son in
the Father, so, too, “the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by
the Holy Spirit, Who hath been given us.” <span
id="fr_829"></span>[830](#fn_829.md) And as he who is blessed in Christ is
blessed in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
Spirit, because the Name is one and the Power one; so, too, when any
divine operation, whether of the Father, or of the Son, or of the Holy
Spirit, is treated of, it is not referred only to the Holy Spirit, but
also to the Father and the Son, and not only to the Father, but also to
the Son and the Spirit.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.iv-p6"></span>41. Then, too, the Ethiopian eunuch of
Queen Candace, when baptized in Christ, obtained the fulness of the
sacrament. And they who said that they knew not of any Holy Spirit,
although they said that they had been baptized with John’s baptism, were
baptized afterwards, because John baptized for the remission of sins in
the Name of the coming Jesus, not in his own. And so they knew not the
Spirit, because in the form in which John baptized they had not received
baptism in the Name of Christ. For John, though he did not baptize in
the Spirit, nevertheless preached Christ and the Spirit. And then, when
he was questioned whether he were perchance himself the Christ, he
answered: “I baptize you with water, but a stronger than I shall come,
Whose shoes I am not worthy to bear, He shall baptize you with the Holy
Spirit and with fire.” <span id="fr_830"></span>[831](#fn_830.md) They
therefore, because they had been baptized neither in the Name of Christ
nor with faith in the Holy Spirit, could not receive the sacrament of
baptism.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.iv-p8"></span>42. So they were baptized in the Name
of Jesus Christ, <span id="fr_831"></span>[832](#fn_831.md) and baptism was
not repeated in their case, but administered differently, for there is
but one baptism. But where there is not the complete sacrament of
baptism, there is not considered to be a commencement nor any kind of
baptism. But baptism is complete if one confess the Father, the Son, and
the Holy Spirit. If you deny One you overthrow the whole. And just as if
you mention in words One only, either the Father, or the Son, or the
Holy Spirit, and in your belief do not deny either the Father, the Son,
or the Holy Spirit, the mystery of the faith is complete, so, too,
although you name the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, and lessen the power
of either the Father, the Son, or the Holy Spirit, the whole mystery is
made empty. And, lastly, they who had said: “We have not heard if there
be any Holy Spirit, were baptized afterwards in the Name of the Lord
Jesus Christ.” <span id="fr_832"></span>[833](#fn_832.md) And this was an
additional abundance of grace, for now through Paul’s preaching they
knew the Holy Spirit.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.iv-p11"></span>43. Nor ought it to seem opposed to
this, that although subsequently mention is not made of the Spirit, He
is yet believed in, and what had not been mentioned in words is
expressed in belief. For when it is said, “In the Name of our Lord Jesus
Christ,” the mystery is complete through the oneness of the Name, and
the Spirit is not separated <span id="page_99">p. 99</span> <span
id="iv.ii.ii.iv-Page_99"></span>from the baptism of Christ, since John
baptized unto repentance, Christ in the Spirit.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.iv-p12"></span>44. Let us now consider whether as we
read that the sacrament of baptism in the Name of Christ was complete,
so, too, when the Holy Spirit alone is named, anything is wanting to the
completeness of the mystery. Let us follow out the argument that he who
has named One has signified the Trinity. If you name Christ, you imply
both God the Father by Whom the Son was anointed, and the Son Himself
Who was anointed, and the Holy Spirit with Whom He was anointed. For it
is written: “This Jesus of Nazareth, Whom God anointed with the Holy
Spirit.” <span id="fr_833"></span>[834](#fn_833.md) And if you name the
Father, you denote equally His Son and the Spirit of His mouth, if, that
is, you apprehend it in your heart. And if you speak of the Spirit, you
name also God the Father, from Whom the Spirit proceeds, and the Son,
inasmuch as He is also the Spirit of the Son.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.iv-p14"></span>45. Wherefore that authority may also
be joined to reason Scripture indicates that we can also be rightly
baptized in the Spirit, when the Lord says: “But ye shall be baptized in
the Holy Spirit.” <span id="fr_834"></span>[835](#fn_834.md) And in another
place the Apostle says: “For we were all baptized in the body itself
into one Spirit.” <span id="fr_835"></span>[836](#fn_835.md) The work is
one, for the mystery is one; the baptism one, for there was one death on
behalf of the world; there is, then, a oneness of working, a oneness of
setting forth, which cannot be separated.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.iv-p17"></span>46. But if in this place the Spirit be
separated from the operation of the Father and the Son, because it is
said, All things are of God, and all things are through the Son, <span
id="fr_836"></span>[837](#fn_836.md) then, too, when the Apostle says of
Christ, “Who is over all, God blessed for ever,” <span
id="fr_837"></span>[838](#fn_837.md) He set Christ not only above all
creatures, but (which it is impious to say) above the Father also. But
God forbid, for the Father is not amongst all things, is not amongst a
kind of crowd of His own creatures. The whole creation is below, over
all is the Godhead of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. The
former serves, the latter rules; the former is subject, the latter
reigns; the former is the work, the latter the author of the work; the
former, without exception, worships, the latter is worshipped by all
without exception.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.iv-p20"></span>47. Lastly, of the Son it is written:
“And let all the angels of God worship Him.” <span
id="fr_838"></span>[839](#fn_838.md) You do not find, Let the Holy Spirit
worship. And farther on: “To which of the angels said He at any time,
Sit thou on My right hand till I make thine enemies the footstool of thy
feet? Are they not all,” says he, “ministering spirits who are sent to
minister?” <span id="fr_839"></span>[840](#fn_839.md) When he says *All,*
does he include the Holy Spirit? Certainly not, because Angels and the
other Powers are destined to serve in ministering and obedience to the
Son of God.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.iv-p23"></span>48. But in truth the Holy Spirit is
not a minister but a witness of the Son, as the Son Himself said of Him:
“He shall bear witness of Me.” <span id="fr_840"></span>[841](#fn_840.md)
The Spirit, then, is a witness of the Son. He who is a witness knows all
things, as God the Father is a witness. For so you read in later
passages, for our salvation was confirmed to us by God bearing witness
by signs and wonders and by manifold powers and by distributions of the
Holy Spirit. <span id="fr_841"></span>[842](#fn_841.md) He who divides as
he will is certainly above all, not amongst all, for to divide is the
gift of the worker, not an innate part of the work itself.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.iv-p26"></span>49. If the Son is above all, through
Whom our salvation received its commencement, so that it might be
preached, certainly God the Father also, Who testifies and gives
confirmation concerning our salvation by signs and wonders, is excepted
from all. In like manner the Spirit, Who bears witness to our salvation
by His diversities of gifts, is not to be numbered with the crowd of
creatures, but to be reckoned with the Father and the Son; Who, when He
divides, is not Himself divided by cutting off Himself, for being
indivisible He loses nothing when He gives to all, as also the Son, when
the Father receives the kingdom, <span id="fr_842"></span>[843](#fn_842.md)
loses nothing, nor does the Father, when He gives that which is His to
the Son, suffer loss. We know, then, by the testimony of the Son that
there is no loss in the division of spiritual grace; for He Who breathes
where He wills <span id="fr_843"></span>[844](#fn_843.md) is everywhere
free from loss. Concerning which power we shall speak more fully farther
on.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.iv-p29"></span>50. In the meanwhile, since our
intention is to prove in due order that the Spirit is not to be reckoned
amongst all things, let us take the Apostle, whose words they call in
question, as an authority for this position. For what “all things” would
be, whether visible or invisible, he himself declared when he said: “For
in Him were all things created in the heavens and in earth.” <span
id="fr_844"></span>[845](#fn_844.md) You see that “all things” is spoken of
things in the heavens, and of things in earth, for in <span
id="page_100">p. 100</span> <span id="iv.ii.ii.iv-Page_100"></span>the
heavens are also invisible things which were made.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.iv-p31"></span>51. But that no one should be ignorant
of this he added those of whom he was speaking: “Whether thrones or
dominions or principalities or powers, all things were created by Him
and in Him, and He is before all, and in Him all things consist.” <span
id="fr_845"></span>[846](#fn_845.md) Does he, then, include the Holy Spirit
here amongst creatures? Or when he says that the Son of God is before
all things, is he to be supposed to have said that He is before the
Father? Certainly not; for as here he says that all things were created
by the Son, and that all things in the heavens consist in Him, so, too,
it cannot be doubted that all things in the heavens have their strength
in the Holy Spirit, since we read: “By the word of the Lord were the
heavens established and all the strength of them by the Spirit of His
mouth.” <span id="fr_846"></span>[847](#fn_846.md) He, then, is above all,
from Whom is all the strength of things in heaven and things on earth.
He, then, Who is above all things certainly does not serve; He Who
serves not is free; He Who is free has the prerogative of lordship.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.iv-p34"></span>52. If I were to say this at first it
would be denied. But in the same manner as they deny the less that the
greater may not be believed, so let us set forth lesser matters first
that either they may show their perfidy in lesser matters, or, if they
grant the lesser matters, we may infer greater from the lesser.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.iv-p35"></span>53. I think, most merciful Emperor,
that they are most fully confuted who dare to reckon the Holy Spirit
amongst all things. But that they may know that they are pressed not
only by the testimony of the apostles, but also by that of our Lord; how
can they dare to reckon the Holy Spirit amongst all things, since the
Lord Himself said: “He who shall blaspheme against the Son of Man, it
shall be forgiven him; but he who shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost
shall never be forgiven, either here or hereafter.” <span
id="fr_847"></span>[848](#fn_847.md) How, then, can any one dare to reckon
the Holy Spirit amongst creatures? Or who will so blind himself as to
think that if he have injured any creature he cannot be forgiven in any
wise? For if the Jews because they worshipped the host of heaven were
deprived of divine protection, whilst he who worships and confesses the
Holy Spirit is accepted of God, but he who confesses Him not is
convicted of sacrilege without forgiveness: certainly it follows from
this that the Holy Spirit cannot be reckoned amongst all things, but
that He is above all things, an offence against Whom is avenged by
eternal punishment.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.iv-p37"></span>54. But observe carefully why the Lord
said: “He who shall blaspheme against the Son of Man it shall be
forgiven him, but he who shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost shall
never be forgiven, either here or hereafter.” <span
id="fr_848"></span>[849](#fn_848.md) Is an offence against the Son
different from one against the Holy Spirit? For as their dignity is one,
and common to both, so too is the offence. But if any one, led astray by
the visible human body, should think somewhat more remissly than is
fitting concerning the Body of Christ (for it ought not to appear of
little worth to us, seeing it is the palace of chastity, and the fruit
of the Virgin), he incurs guilt, but he is not shut out from pardon,
which he may attain to by faith. But if any one should deny the dignity,
majesty, and eternal power of the Holy Spirit, and should think that
devils are cast out not in the Spirit of God, but in Beelzebub, there
can be no attaining of pardon there where is the fulness of sacrilege;
for he who has denied the Spirit has denied also the Father and the Son,
since the same is the Spirit of God Who is the Spirit of Christ.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.iv-p9"></span> This passage has given rise to the
question whether St. Ambrose taught, as some others certainly did
(probably on his authority), that baptism in the Name of Christ alone,
without mention of the other Persons, is valid. But it is difficult to
believe that St. Ambrose meant more than to refer to the passage in the
Acts as implying Christian baptism. He says just below that baptism is
not complete unless one confess the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, which
would seem to imply the full formula, and he would hardly dissent from
St. Basil, who distinctly asserts \[*De Sp. Sanct.* XII.\] that baptism
without mention of the Three Persons is invalid; and St. Augustine \[*De
Bapt.* lib. vi. c. xxv. 47\] says that it is more easy to find heretics
who reject baptism altogether, than such as omit the right form. Compare
also St. Ambrose on St. [Luke vi.
