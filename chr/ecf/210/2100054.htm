<p class="c32"><a name="iv.i.ii.xlii-p1"></A>The powers that be are not needlessly to be irritated. One must not lend one&#146;s ears to flattery.</p>  
<p class="c22"><a name="iv.i.ii.xlii-p2"></A>217. <span class="sc"><a name="iv.i.ii.xlii-p2.1"></A>I think</span> we must take care, lest in being led on by too great a desire for glory, we should abuse the powers that be, and arouse the minds of the heathen, who are opposed to us, to desire persecution, and excite them to anger. How many do some cause to perish, that they themselves may continue to the end, and overcome their tortures!</p>  
<p class="c23"><a name="iv.i.ii.xlii-p3"></A>218. We must also look to it that we do not open our ears to flatterers. To allow oneself to be smoothed down by flattery seems to be a sign not only of want of fortitude, but a sign of actual cowardice.</p>
