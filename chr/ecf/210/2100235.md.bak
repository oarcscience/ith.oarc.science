#### <span id="iv.iv.v.xiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIII.

<span id="iv.iv.v.xiii-p1"></span>The majesty of the Son is His own, and
equal to that of the Father, and the angels are not partakers, but
beholders thereof.

<span id="iv.iv.v.xiii-p2"></span>103. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.v.xiii-p2.1"></span>Now</span>, we having already laid down
that the Father and the Son are of one image and likeness, <span
id="fr_2279"></span>[2280](#fn_2279.md) it remains for us to show that They
are also of one majesty. And we need not go far afield for proof,
inasmuch as the Son Himself has said of Himself: “When the Son of Man
shall come in His majesty, and all the angels with Him, then shall He
sit upon the throne of His majesty.” <span
id="fr_2280"></span>[2281](#fn_2280.md) Behold, then, the majesty of the
Son declared! What lacketh He yet, Whose uncreated majesty cannot be
denied? <span id="fr_2281"></span>[2282](#fn_2281.md) Majesty, then,
belongeth to the Son.

<span id="iv.iv.v.xiii-p6"></span>104. Let our adversaries now hold it
proved beyond doubt that the majesty of the Father and of the Son is
one, forasmuch as the Lord Himself hath said: “For he who shall be
ashamed of Me and of My words, of Him shall the Son of Man be ashamed,
when He cometh in His majesty and His Father’s, and the majesty of the
holy angels.” <span id="fr_2282"></span>[2283](#fn_2282.md) What is the
force of the words “and the majesty of the holy angels,” but that the
servants derive honour from the worship of their Lord?

<span id="iv.iv.v.xiii-p8"></span>105. The Son, therefore, ascribed His
majesty to His Father as well as to Himself, not, indeed, in such sort
that the angels should share in that majesty on equal terms with the
Father and the Son, but that they should behold the surpassing glory of
God; for truly not even angels possess a majesty of their own, after the
manner in which Scripture speaks of the Son: “When He shall sit upon the
throne of His majesty,” but they stand in the presence, that they may
see the glory of the Father and the Son, in such degrees of vision as
they are either worthy of or able to bear.

<span id="iv.iv.v.xiii-p9"></span>106. Furthermore, the God-given words
themselves declare their own meaning, that you may understand that glory
of the Father and the Son not to be held in common with them by angels,
for thus they run: “But when the Son of Man shall come in His majesty,
and all the angels with Him.” Again, to show that His Father’s majesty
and glory and His own majesty and glory are one and the same, our Lord
Himself saith in another book: “And the Son of Man shall confound him,
when He shall come in the glory of His Father, with the holy
angels.” <span id="fr_2283"></span>[2284](#fn_2283.md) The angels come in
obedience, He comes in glory: they are His retainers, He sits upon His
throne: they stand, He is seated—to borrow terms of the daily dealings
of human life, He is the Judge: they are the officers of the court. Note
that He did not place first His Father’s divine majesty, and then, in
the second place, His own and the angels’, lest He should seem to have
made out a sort of descending order, from the highest to lower natures.
He placed His own majesty first, and then spoke of His Father’s, and the
majesty of the angels (because the Father could not appear lower than
they), in order that He might not, by placing mention of Himself between
that of His Father and that of the angels, seem to have made out some
ascending scale, leading from angels to the Father through increase of
His own dignity; nor, again, be believed to have, contrariwise, shown a
descent from the Father to angels, entailing diminution of that dignity.
Now we who confess one Godhead of the Father and the Son suppose no such
order of distinction as the Arians do. <span
