## <span id="iii.v-p0.1"></span>V. Life of St. Ambrose.

<span id="iii.v-p1"></span>St. Ambrose, Bishop of Milan, one of the four
Latin doctors of the Church, was descended from a Roman family of some
distinction, some time Christian, and counting martyrs as well as state
officials amongst its members.

<span id="iii.v-p2"></span>His father, likewise named Ambrosius, was
prefect of the Gauls, an office the jurisdiction of which extended over
Spain, Britain, Cis- and Trans-Alpine Gaul. His chief official residence
was Trèves, where probably St. Ambrose was born, as seems most likely,
<span class="sc"><span id="iii.v-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> 340. <span
id="fr_16"></span>[17](#fn_16.md)

<span id="iii.v-p4"></span>After his father’s death, his mother and his
elder brother, Satyrus, went with St. Ambrose to Rome, not earlier than
353, where his elder sister, Marcellina, received the veil at Christmas
from Pope Liberius, the exact year being uncertain.

<span id="iii.v-p5"></span>Here the future bishop devoted himself to
legal studies, in which he met with great success. His skill in law and
general reputation soon led to his advancement, and about <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v-p5.1"></span>a.d.</span> 370 he was appointed
by the Prætorian Prefect Probus governor of Liguria and Æmilia, with the
rank of consular. <span id="fr_17"></span>[18](#fn_17.md) On this occasion
Probus is said to have closed an address to St. Ambrose with the words,
“Go and act, not as a judge, but as a bishop.” This advice was so well
followed by Ambrose, that owing to his equity and kindness the people
came to look up to him rather as a father than as a judge. <span
id="fr_18"></span>[19](#fn_18.md)

<span id="iii.v-p8"></span>After some few years Auxentius, <span
id="fr_19"></span>[20](#fn_19.md) the intended Arian Bishop of Milan, died,
<span class="sc"><span id="iii.v-p9.2"></span>a.d.</span> 374, and it is
said that during the discussion as to the appointment of his successor a
child cried out in the assembly, “Ambrose Bishop,” and, although he was
but a catechumen and so canonically unqualified, the multitude
immediately elected him by acclamation.

<span id="iii.v-p10"></span>St. Ambrose did all in his power, even, if
we accept the statements if his biographer Paulinus, probably a clerk of
Milan, resorting to some questionable expedients, to escape from the
dignity laid upon him, but when his election was ratified by the Emperor
Valentinian, he recognized his appointment as being the will of God, and
insisted on being baptized by a Catholic priest. Eight days later,
December 7, <span class="sc"><span id="iii.v-p10.1"></span>a.d.</span>
374, he was consecrated Bishop.

<span id="iii.v-p11"></span>The first care of the new bishop was at once
to divest himself of his worldly property, giving his silver and gold to
the poor and the Church, and committing the management of his estates,
except a life interest for his sister, to his brother Satyrus, who gave
up his own office to come to his assistance, and enable him to devote
himself wholly to theological study and his other episcopal duties.

<span id="iii.v-p12"></span>His chief studies were holy Scripture and
ecclesiastical writers, especially St. Basil the Great and Didymus of
Alexandria, from whom no less a man than St. Jerome accused him of
plagiarizing. His natural abilities and thorough knowledge of Greek
stood him in good stead, when, as he says himself, <span
id="fr_20"></span>[21](#fn_20.md) he had to learn and to teach at the same
time.

<span id="iii.v-p14"></span>The life of St. Ambrose was a pattern of the
discharge of episcopal duties. He spent much time daily in study and
devotion, besides the more public duties of his office. <span
id="fr_21"></span>[22](#fn_21.md) He <span id="page_xvi">p. xvi</span>
<span id="iii.v-Page_xvi"></span>preached every Sunday and at certain
seasons daily. His labours in preparing catechumens for baptism were
blessed with great success, amongst those taught by him being St.
Augustine.

<span id="iii.v-p16"></span>But the zeal and courage of the new Bishop
were soon tried. The Empress mother Justina was still an Arian, but had
little influence during the life of the Emperor Gratian, who was much
attached to St. Ambrose. After his murder, however, <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v-p16.1"></span>a.d.</span> 383, his brother
Valentinian II., a boy of only twelve years of age, ascended the throne
and was naturally much under his mother’s influence. Justina led him to
support a demand of the Arians for the use of the Portian basilica,
situated outside the walls of Milan. This being refused, a second
application was made for the large and newer basilica within the city.
Ambrose replied, “The Emperor has his palaces, let him leave the
churches to the Bishop.” Soldiers were sent to secure the delivery of
the basilica, but St. Ambrose with the faithful occupied the building
and remained within, singing psalms and hymns till the soldiers retired.

<span id="iii.v-p17"></span>St. Ambrose was no less successful in his
zeal against the expiring heathenism of Italy than against Arianism. One
of the many remnants till recent times of heathen worship had been the
Altar of Victory in the Senate-house at Rome, which was removed under
Gratian; the prefect of Rome, Symmachus, himself a heathen but a friend
of St. Ambrose, appealed to Valentinan II. that it might be restored,
and Ambrose successfully opposed this appeal in two Epistles (17, 18)
addressed to the young Emperor. Yet again, when Theodosius assumed the
imperial power \[<span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v-p17.1"></span>a.d.</span> 387\], a renewed attempt was made
and once more frustrated. Later on, Eugenius the usurper judged it
politic to take the heathen’s side, <span id="fr_22"></span>[23](#fn_22.md)
the Altar of Victory was once more set up, and the temples stood open as
in the days of old. But this triumph lasted only for a brief period.
When Theodosius defeated the usurper at Aquileia, in the spring of 394,
he also defeated paganism, which sank to rise no more as a public
religion, though it long lingered in private amidst indifference,
toleration, and at times persecution.

<span id="iii.v-p19"></span>The influence exercised by Ambrose upon the
rulers of his day is sufficiently manifested by these facts, but he had
the courage to use not only influence, but, when needed, rebuke and
Church discipline.

<span id="iii.v-p20"></span>Only a few months after his elevation to the
see of Milan, he remonstrated with Valentinian I. concerning the
severity of his rule and other abuses, and required amendment. The
Emperor’s reply did him honour: “Well, if I have offended, prescribe for
me the remedies which the law of God requires.” Again, on another
occasion, in 390, Theodosius had put down a seditious movement in
Thessalonica with great severity, causing some 7,000 persons to be
slain. St. Ambrose at once, disregarding the possible consequences to
himself, wrote him a letter (Ep. 51<span id="iii.v-p20.1"></span>) on
the subject, exhorting him to repentance, and pointing out that he could
not permit him to be present at the celebration of the Mysteries, till
he had openly testified his sorrow. At another time when the same
Emperor had ventured into the sanctuary or chancel of the church, which
was the right of the clergy alone, St. Ambrose rebuked him and caused
him to retire.

<span id="iii.v-p21"></span>These acts of ecclesiastical discipline were
also accompanied by others in which the great Bishop was able in
temporal matters to assist the imperial family.

<span id="iii.v-p22"></span>Twice on behalf of the young Emperor
Valentinian II. he undertook a mission to Trèves, to see the usurper
Maximus, and when Valentinian died, St. Ambrose delivered a striking
oration at his funeral, recording his many virtues. Theodosius did not
survive his victory over Eugenius for many months. In January of the
following year \[<span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v-p22.1"></span>a.d.</span> 395\], he died at Milan, and the
funeral oration which St. Ambrose pronounced over him is also extant.

<span id="iii.v-p23"></span>Yet whilst thus devoting much time to
weighty affairs of State, the Bishop never neglected the duties of his
office. He preached every Sunday, at great festivals, once or more
often, every day. He celebrated the Holy Mysteries daily. His life was
marked by perfect purity, sympathy, energy, and devotion. He was always
ready to help those requiring assistance, and so when Augustine came to
Milan to teach rhetoric, <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v-p23.1"></span>a.d.</span> 384, he was kindly received and
fascinated. Probably he owed his conversion even more to the life and
character than to the teaching of St. Ambrose.

<span id="iii.v-p24"></span>One subject St. Ambrose never tired of
recommending was Virginity; and such was the power of his exhortations
that mothers used to forbid their daughters to attend his sermons and
addresses.

<span id="iii.v-p25"></span>The indefatigable zeal of the great Bishop
further exhibited itself in the number of his <span id="page_xvii">p.
xvii</span> <span id="iii.v-Page_xvii"></span>writings. Many of them
consist of addresses subsequently worked up into treatises, and are on
all subjects, dogmatic, controversial, exegetical, and ascetic. There
remain also a large number of valuable letters, and some hymns, probably
from four to twelve of those ascribed to him being genuine, and in use
to the present day.

<span id="iii.v-p26"></span>But besides his writings and his resistance
to the attacks of Arianism, heathenism, or the secular power, St.
Ambrose devoted himself to actively defending the cause of the Church
and of orthodoxy wherever he had the opportunity. Although the death of
Satyrus, <span class="sc"><span id="iii.v-p26.1"></span>a.d.</span> 379,
must have greatly added to the troubles of St. Ambrose, he was as
watchful as ever against all possibilities of heretical aggression. To
his care and opposition to the party of the Empress Justina it was owing
that the city of Sirmium was preserved in <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v-p26.2"></span>a.d.</span> 381 from receiving an Arian bishop.
And in the same year, when the Arians, hoping for large support from the
East, had almost persuaded the Emperor to summon a general council at
Aquileia, St. Ambrose prevailed upon him to summon only the neighbouring
bishops, and what might have been a serious evil was avoided.

<span id="iii.v-p27"></span>In such ways the holy man, embracing in his
far-seeing care the interests of religion far and wide, spent his days
in unceasing labour till his health failed in the year 397, when, as is
related by Paulinus, Count Stilicho, saying that the loss of such a man
threatened destruction to Italy, persuaded the nobles of the city to
request St. Ambrose that he would pray for longer life. But the Saint
replied: “I have not so lived amongst you as to be ashamed of living,
and I do not fear to die, for we have a good Lord.” As some of the
bystanders were discussing in whispers who would be St. Ambrose’s
successor, and mentioned Simplicianus, he overheard them, and said, “An
old man, but good.” For the last few hours of his life Ambrose lay with
his arms extended in the form of a cross, praying. Honoratus, Bishop of
Vercellæ, lying in another room, heard himself called thrice, and coming
down, offered him the Body of the Lord, after receiving which St.
Ambrose breathed his last, on Good Friday night, April 4–5, <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v-p27.1"></span>a.d.</span> 397, and was laid
to rest on Easter morning in the Ambrosian basilica at Milan, where he
still is reverenced, and in which the Ambrosian liturgy and rites,
differing considerably from the Roman use of the rest of the churches of
Italy, continue to this day, though doubtless with many modifications
subsequent to the time of St. Ambrose.

<span id="iii.v-p3"></span> The exact date depends upon whether the
passage “*barbaracis motibus et bellorum procellis,*” etc., Ep.
lix.<span id="iii.v-p3.1"></span>, 12–3, refers to the war against
Maximus, <span class="sc"><span id="iii.v-p3.2"></span>a.d.</span> 387,
or to that against Eugenius, <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v-p3.3"></span>a.d.</span> 393–4; so that the birth year of St.
Ambrose might be 333 or 340. The latter date is, however, most generally
accepted.

Bishop Dionysius was banished with many others, Auxentius was intruded
in his stead, and, as St. Athanasius remarked, a Latin Church received
as its pastor one who was ignorant of the Latin tongue, St. Hilary and
others endeavoured to remove him, but in vain, and in 369 Auxentius was
excommunicated in a synod at Rome, but succeeded in maintaining his
post.
