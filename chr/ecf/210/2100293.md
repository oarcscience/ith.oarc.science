#### <span id="iv.vi.ii.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.vi-p1"></span>The Novatians, by excluding such from
the banquet of Christ, imitate not indeed the good Samaritan, but the
proud lawyer, the priest, and the Levite who are blamed in the Gospel,
and are indeed worse than these.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.vi-p2"></span>27. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.vi-p2.1"></span>Do</span> you then, O Novatians, shut out
<span id="page_334">p. 334</span> <span
id="iv.vi.ii.vi-Page_334"></span>these? For what is it when you refuse
the hope of forgiveness but to shut out? But the Samaritan did not pass
by the man who had been left half dead by the robbers; he dressed his
wounds with oil and wine, first pouring in oil in order to comfort them;
he set the wounded man on his own beast, on which he bore all his sins;
nor did the Shepherd despise His wandering sheep.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.vi-p3"></span>28. But you say: “Touch me not.” You
who wish to justify yourselves say, “He is not our neighbour,” being
more proud than that lawyer who wished to tempt Christ, for he said “Who
is my neighbour?” He asked, you deny, going on like that priest, like
that Levite passing by him whom you ought to have taken and tended, and
not receiving them into the inn for whom Christ paid the two pence,
whose neighbour Christ bids you to become that you might show mercy to
him. For he is our neighbour whom not only a similar condition has
joined, but whom mercy has bound to us. You make yourself strange to him
through pride, in vain puffing up yourself in your carnal mind, and not
holding the Head. <span id="fr_2946"></span>[2947](#fn_2946) For if you
held the Head you would consider that you must not forsake him for whom
Christ died. If you held the Head you would consider that the whole
body, by joining together rather than by separating, grows unto the
increase of God <span id="fr_2947"></span>[2948](#fn_2947) by the bond
of charity and the rescue of a sinner.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.vi-p6"></span>29. When, then, you take away all the
fruits of repentance, what do you say but this: Let no one who is
wounded enter our inn, let no one be healed in our Church? With us the
sick are not cared for, we are whole, we have no need of a physician,
for He Himself says: “They that are whole need not a physician, but they
that are sick.”

Novatians, and shows that they have no part with Christ, Who wishes all
men to be saved.](2100294)
