#### <span id="iv.i.ii.xxxiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXIII.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxxiii-p1"></span>Good-will exists especially in the
Church, and nourishes kindred virtues.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxxiii-p2"></span>170. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.ii.xxxiii-p2.1"></span>Good-will</span> expands in the body of
the Church, <span id="fr_252"></span>[253](#fn_252) by fellowship in
faith, by the bond of baptism, by kinship through grace received, by
communion in the mysteries. For all these bonds claim for themselves the
name of intimacy, the reverence of children, the authority and religious
care of parents, the relationship of brothers. Therefore the bonds of
grace clearly point to an increase of good-will.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxxiii-p4"></span>171. The desire to attain to like
virtues also stands one in good stead; <span
id="fr_253"></span>[254](#fn_253) just as again good-will brings about a
likeness in character. For Jonathan the king’s son imitated the
gentleness of holy David, because he loved him. Wherefore those words:
“With the holy thou shalt be holy,” <span
id="fr_254"></span>[255](#fn_254) seem not only to be concerned with our
ordinary intercourse, but also to have some connection with good-will.
The sons of Noah indeed dwelt together, and yet their characters were
not at all alike. Esau and Jacob also dwelt together in their father’s
house, but were very unlike. There was, however, no good-will between
them to make the one prefer the other to himself, but rather a rivalry
as to which should first get the blessing. Since one was so hard, and
the other gentle, good-will could not exist as between such different
characters and conflicting desires. Add to this the fact that holy Jacob
could not prefer the unworthy in son of his father’s house to virtue.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxxiii-p7"></span>172. But nothing is so
harmonious <span id="fr_255"></span>[256](#fn_255) as justice and
impartiality. For this, as the comrade and ally of good-will, makes us
love those whom we think to be like ourselves. Again, good-will contains
also in itself fortitude. For when friendship springs from the fount of
good-will it does not hesitate to endure the great dangers of life for a
friend. “If evils come to me through him,” it says, “I will bear
them.” <span id="fr_256"></span>[257](#fn_256)
