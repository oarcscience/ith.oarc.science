id="iv.ii.ii.xvi-Page_113"></span>

#### <span id="iv.ii.ii.xvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XV.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xvi-p1"></span>The Holy Spirit is Life equally with
the Father and the Son, in truth whether the Father be mentioned, with
Whom is the Fount of Life, or the Son, that Fount can be none other than
the Holy Spirit.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xvi-p2"></span>171. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.ii.ii.xvi-p2.1"></span>We</span> have said that the Father is
Light, the Son is Light, and the Holy Spirit is Light; let us also learn
that the Father is Life, the Son Life, and the Holy Spirit Life. For
John said: “That which was from the beginning, that which we have heard,
and which we have seen, and have beheld with our eyes, and our hands
have handled concerning the Word of Life; and the Life appeared, and we
saw and testify, and declare to you of that Life which was with the
Father.” <span id="fr_982"></span>[983](#fn_982.md) He said both Word of
Life and Life that he might signify both the Father and the Son to be
Life. For what is the Word of Life but the Word of God? And by this
phrase both God and the Word of God are shown to be Life. And as it is
said the Word of Life, so, too, the Spirit of Life. Therefore, as the
Word of Life is Life, so, too, the Spirit of Life is Life.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xvi-p4"></span>172. Learn now that as the Father is
the Fount of Life, so, too, many have stated that the Son is signified
as the Fount of Life; <span id="fr_983"></span>[984](#fn_983.md) so that,
he says, with Thee, Almighty God, Thy Son is the Fount of Life. That is
the Fount of the Holy Spirit, <span id="fr_984"></span>[985](#fn_984.md)
for the Spirit is Life, as the Lord says: “The words which I speak unto
you are Spirit and Life,” <span id="fr_985"></span>[986](#fn_985.md) for
where the Spirit is, there also is Life; and where Life is, is also the
Holy Spirit.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xvi-p8"></span>173. Many, however, consider that in
this passage the Father only is signified by the Fount. Let them,
however, notice what the Scripture relates: “With Thee is the Well of
Life.” That is, the Son is with the Father; since the Word was with God,
Who was in the beginning, and was with God.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xvi-p9"></span>174. But whether in this place one
understands the Fount to be the Father or the Son, we certainly do not
understand a fount of that water which is created, but the Fount of that
divine grace, that is, of the Holy Spirit, for He is the living water.
Wherefore the Lord said: “If thou knowest the gift of God, and Who He is
that saith to thee, Give me to drink, thou wouldst have asked Him, and
He would have given thee living water.” <span
id="fr_986"></span>[987](#fn_986.md)

<span id="iv.ii.ii.xvi-p11"></span>175. This was the water for which the
soul of David thirsted. The hart desires the fountain of these
waters, <span id="fr_987"></span>[988](#fn_987.md) not thirsting for the
poison of serpents. For the water of the grace of the Spirit is living,
that it may purify the inner parts of the mind, and wash away every sin
of the soul, and purify the transgression of hidden faults.

plainly to set forth the procession of the Holy Spirit from the Son,
though he admits that some consider the Father to be the Fount of Life,
but he argues even in this case the Son was with Him.

[Next: Chapter XVI. The Holy Spirit is that large river by which the
mystical Jerusalem is watered. It is equal to its Fount, that is, the
Father and the Son, as is signified in holy Scripture. St. Ambrose
himself thirsts for that water, and warns us that in order to preserve
it within us, we must avoid the devil, lust, and heresy, since our
vessels are frail, and that broken cisterns must be forsaken, that after
the example of the Samaritan woman and of the patriarchs we may find the
water of the Lord.](2100136.md)
