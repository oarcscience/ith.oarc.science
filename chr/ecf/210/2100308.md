#### <span id="iv.vi.iii.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.iii-p1"></span>Explanation of the parable of the
Prodigal Son, in which St. Ambrose applies it to refute the teaching of
the Novatians, proving that reconciliation ought not to be refused to
the greatest offender upon suitable proof of repentance.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.iii-p2"></span>13. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.iii.iii-p2.1"></span>And</span> the Apostle does not
contradict <span id="page_347">p. 347</span> <span
id="iv.vi.iii.iii-Page_347"></span>the plain teaching of Christ, Who set
forth, as a comparison of a repentant sinner, one going to a foreign
country after receiving all his substance from his father, wasted it in
riotous living, and later, when feeding upon husks, longed for his
father’s bread and then gained the robe, the ring, the shoes, and the
slaying of the calf, <span id="fr_3068"></span>[3069](#fn_3068.md) which is
a likeness of the Passion of the Lord, whereby we receive forgiveness.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.iii-p4"></span>14. Well is it said that he went into
a foreign country who is cut off from the sacred altar, for this is to
be separated from that Jerusalem which is in heaven, from the
citizenship and home of the saints. For which reason the Apostle says:
“Therefore now ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but
fellow-citizens with the saints and of the household of God.” <span
id="fr_3069"></span>[3070](#fn_3069.md)

<span id="iv.vi.iii.iii-p6"></span>15. “And,” it is said, “wasted his
substance.” Rightly, for he whose faith halts in bringing forth good
works does consume it. For, “faith is the substance of things hoped for,
the evidence of things not seen.” <span
id="fr_3070"></span>[3071](#fn_3070.md) And faith is a good substance, the
inheritance of our hope.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.iii-p8"></span>16. And no wonder if he was perishing
for hunger, who lacked the divine nourishment, impelled by the want of
which he says: “I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him:
Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee.” Do you not see
it plainly declared to us, that we are urged to prayer for the sake of
gaining the sacrament? and do you wish to take away that for the sake of
which penance is undertaken? Deprive the pilot of the hope of reaching
port, and he will wander uncertainly here and there on the waves. Take
away the crown from the athlete, and he will fail and lie on the course.
Take from the fisher the power of catching his booty, and he will cease
to cast the nets. How, then, can he, who suffers hunger in his soul,
pray more earnestly to God, if he has no hope of the heavenly food?

<span id="iv.vi.iii.iii-p9"></span>17. “I have sinned,” he says,
“against heaven, and before thee.” He confesses what is clearly a sin
unto death, that you may not think that any one doing penance <span
id="fr_3071"></span>[3072](#fn_3071.md) is rightly shut out from pardon.
For he who has sinned against heaven has sinned either against the
kingdom of heaven, or against his own soul, which is a sin unto death,
and against God, to Whom alone is said: “Against Thee only have I
sinned, and done evil before Thee.” <span
id="fr_3072"></span>[3073](#fn_3072.md)

<span id="iv.vi.iii.iii-p12"></span>18. So quickly does he gain
forgiveness, that, as he is coming, and is still a great way off, his
father meets him, gives him a kiss, which is the sign of sacred peace;
orders the robe to be brought forth, which is the marriage garment,
which if any one have not, he is shut out from the marriage feast;
places the ring on his hand, which is the pledge of faith and the seal
of the Holy Spirit; orders the shoes to be brought out, <span
id="fr_3073"></span>[3074](#fn_3073.md) for he who is about to celebrate
the Lord’s Passover, about to feast on the Lamb, ought to have his feet
protected against all attacks of spiritual wild beasts and the bite of
the serpent; bids the calf to be slain, for “Christ our Passover hath
been sacrificed.” <span id="fr_3074"></span>[3075](#fn_3074.md) For as
often as we receive the Blood of the Lord, we proclaim the death of the
Lord. <span id="fr_3075"></span>[3076](#fn_3075.md) As, then, He was once
slain for all, so whensoever forgiveness of sins is granted, we receive
the Sacrament of His Body, that through His Blood there may be remission
of sins.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.iii-p16"></span>19. Therefore most evidently are we
bidden by the teaching of the Lord to confer again the grace of the
heavenly sacrament on those guilty even of the greatest sins, if they
with open confession bear the penance due to their sin.

[Next: Chapter IV. St. Ambrose turns against the Novatians themselves
another objection concerning blasphemy against the Holy Spirit, showing
that it consists in an erroneous belief, proving this by St. Peter's
words against Simon Magus, and other passages, exhorting the Novatians
to return to the Church, affirming that such is our Lord's mercy that
even Judas would have found forgiveness had he repented.](2100309.md)
