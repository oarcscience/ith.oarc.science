#### <span id="iv.iv.iii.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.iv-p1"></span>By evidence gathered from Scripture
the unity of Father and Son is proved, and firstly, a passage, taken
from the Book of Isaiah, is compared with others and expounded in such
sort as to show that in the Son there is no diversity from the Father’s
nature, save only as regards the flesh; whence it follows that the
Godhead of both Persons is One. This conclusion is confirmed by the
authority of Baruch.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.iv-p2"></span>20. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.iii.iv-p2.1"></span>Now</span> the oracles <span
id="fr_1704"></span>[1705](#fn_1704.md) of the prophets bear witness what
close unity holy Scripture declares to subsist between the Father and
the Son as regards their Godhead. For thus saith the Lord of
Sabaoth: <span id="fr_1705"></span>[1706](#fn_1705.md) “Egypt hath
laboured, and the commerce of the Ethiopians and Sabeans: mighty men
shall come over to thee, and shall be thy servants, and in thy train
shall they follow, bound in fetters, and they shall fall down before
thee, and to thee shall they make supplication: for God is in thee, and
there is no God beside thee. For thou art God, and we knew it not, O God
of Israel.” <span id="fr_1706"></span>[1707](#fn_1706.md)

<span id="iv.iv.iii.iv-p6"></span>21. Hear the voice of the prophet: “In
Thee,” he saith, “is God, and there is no God beside Thee.” How agreeth
this with the Arians’ teaching? They must deny either the Father’s or
the Son’s Divinity, unless they believe, once for all, unity of the same
Divinity.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.iv-p7"></span>22. “In Thee,” saith he, “is
God”—forasmuch as the Father is in the Son. For it is written, “The
Father, Who abideth in Me, Himself speaketh,” and “The works that I do,
He Himself also doeth.” <span id="fr_1707"></span>[1708](#fn_1707.md) And
yet again we read that the Son is in the Father, saying, “I am in the
Father, and the Father in Me.” <span
id="fr_1708"></span>[1709](#fn_1708.md) Let the Arians, if they can, make
away with this kinship <span id="fr_1709"></span>[1710](#fn_1709.md) in
nature and unity in work.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.iv-p11"></span>23. There is, therefore, God in God,
but not two Gods; for it is written that there is one God, <span
id="fr_1710"></span>[1711](#fn_1710.md) and there is Lord in Lord, <span
id="fr_1711"></span>[1712](#fn_1711.md) but not two Lords, forasmuch as it
is likewise written: “Serve not two lords.” <span
id="fr_1712"></span>[1713](#fn_1712.md) And the Law saith: “Hear, O Israel!
The Lord thy God is one God;” <span id="fr_1713"></span>[1714](#fn_1713.md)
moreover, in the same Testament it is written: “The Lord rained from the
Lord.” <span id="fr_1714"></span>[1715](#fn_1714.md) The Lord, it is said,
sent rain “from the Lord.” So also you may read in Genesis: “And God
said,—and God made,” <span id="fr_1715"></span>[1716](#fn_1715.md) and,
lower down, “And God made man in the image of God;” <span
id="fr_1716"></span>[1717](#fn_1716.md) yet it was not two gods, but one
God, that made \[man\]. In the one place, then, as in the other, the
unity of operation and of name is maintained. For surely, when we read
“God of God,” <span id="fr_1717"></span>[1718](#fn_1717.md) we do not speak
of two Gods.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.iv-p20"></span>24. Again, you may read in the
forty-fourth psalm <span id="fr_1718"></span>[1719](#fn_1718.md) how the
prophet not only calls the Father “God” but also proclaims the Son as
God, saying: “Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever.” <span
id="fr_1719"></span>[1720](#fn_1719.md) And further on: “God, even thy God,
hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.” <span
id="fr_1720"></span>[1721](#fn_1720.md) This God Who anoints, and God <span
id="page_205">p. 205</span> <span id="iv.iv.iii.iv-Page_205"></span>Who
in the flesh is anointed, is the Son of God. For what fellows in His
anointing hath Christ, except such as are in the flesh? You see, then,
that God is by God anointed, but being anointed in taking upon Him the
nature of mankind, He is proclaimed the Son of God; yet is the principle
of the Law not broken.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.iv-p24"></span>25. So again, when you read, “The
Lord rained from the Lord,” acknowledge the unity of Godhead, for unity
in operation doth not allow of more than one individual God, even as the
Lord Himself has shown, saying: “Believe Me, that I am in the Father,
and the Father in Me: or believe Me for the very works’ sake.” <span
id="fr_1721"></span>[1722](#fn_1721.md) Here, too, we see that unity of
Godhead is signified by unity in operation.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.iv-p26"></span>26. The Apostle, careful to prove
that there is one Godhead of both Father and Son, and one Lordship, lest
we should run into any error, whether of heathen or of Jewish
ungodliness, showed us the rule we ought to follow, saying: “One God,
the Father, from Whom are all things, and we in Him, and one Lord, Jesus
Christ, by Whom are all things, and we by Him.” <span
id="fr_1722"></span>[1723](#fn_1722.md) For just as, in calling Jesus
Christ “Lord,” he did not deny that the Father was Lord, even so, in
saying, “One God, the Father,” he did not deny true Godhead to the Son,
and thus he taught, not that there was more than one God, but that the
source of power was one, forasmuch as Godhead consists in Lordship, and
Lordship in Godhead, as it is written: “Be ye sure that the Lord, He is
God. It is He that hath made us, and not we ourselves.” <span
id="fr_1723"></span>[1724](#fn_1723.md)

<span id="iv.iv.iii.iv-p29"></span>27. “In thee,” therefore, “is God,”
by unity of nature, and “there is no God beside Thee,” by reason of
personal possession of the Substance, without any reserve or
difference. <span id="fr_1724"></span>[1725](#fn_1724.md)

<span id="iv.iv.iii.iv-p31"></span>28. Again, Scripture speaks, in the
Book of Jeremiah, of One God, and yet acknowledges both Father and Son.
Thus we read: “He is our God, and in comparison with Him none other
shall be accounted of. He hath discovered all the way of teaching, and
given it to Jacob, His servant, and to Israel, His beloved. After these
things He appeared upon earth, and conversed with men.”

<span id="iv.iv.iii.iv-p32"></span>29. The prophet speaks of the Son,
for it was the Son Himself Who conversed with men, and this is what he
says: “He is our God, and in comparison with Him none other shall be
accounted of.” Why do we call Him in question, of Whom so great a
prophet saith that no other can be compared with Him? What comparison of
another *can* be made, when the Godhead is One? This was the confession
of a people set in the midst of dangers; reverencing religion, and
therefore unskilled in strife of argument.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.iv-p33"></span>30. Come, Holy Spirit, and help Thy
prophets, in whom Thou art wont to dwell, in whom we believe. Shall we
believe the wise of this world, if we believe not the prophets? But
where is the wise man, where is the scribe? When our peasant planted
figs, he found that whereof the philosopher knew nothing, for God hath
chosen the foolish things of this world to confound the strong. <span
id="fr_1725"></span>[1726](#fn_1725.md) Are we to believe the Jews? for God
was once known in Jewry. Nay, but they deny that very thing, which is
the foundation of our belief, seeing that they know not the Father, who
have denied the Son. <span id="fr_1726"></span>[1727](#fn_1726.md)

[Next: Chapter IV. The Unity of God is necessarily implied in the order
of Nature, in the Faith, and in Baptism. The gifts of the Magi declare
(1) the Unity of the Godhead; (2) Christ's Godhead and Manhood. The
truth of the doctrine of the Trinity in Unity is shown in the Angel
walking in the midst of the furnace with Shadrach, Meshach, and
Abednego.](2100187.md)
