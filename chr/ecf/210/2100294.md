<span id="iv.vi.ii.vii"></span>

#### <span id="iv.vi.ii.vii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VII.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.vii-p1"></span>St. Ambrose, addressing Christ,
complains of the Novatians, and shows that they have no part with
Christ, Who wishes all men to be saved.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.vii-p2"></span>30. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.vii-p2.1"></span>So</span>, then, Lord Jesus, come wholly
to Thy Church, since Novatian makes excuse. Novatian says, “I have
bought a yoke of oxen,” and he puts not on the light yoke of Christ, but
lays upon his shoulders a heavy burden which he is not able to bear.
Novatian held back Thy servants by whom he was invited, treated them
contemptuously and slew them, polluting them with the stain of a
reiterated baptism. Send forth, therefore, into the highways, and gather
together good and bad, <span id="fr_2948"></span>[2949](#fn_2948.md) bring
the weak, the blind, and the lame into Thy Church. Command that Thy
house be filled, bring in all unto Thy supper, for Thou wilt make him
whom Thou shalt call worthy, if he follow Thee. He indeed is rejected
who has not the wedding garment, that is, the vestment of charity, the
veil of grace. Send forth I pray Thee to all.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.vii-p4"></span>31. Thy Church does not excuse herself
from Thy supper, Novatian makes excuse. Thy family says not, “I am
whole, I need not the physician,” but it says: “Heal me, O Lord, and I
shall be healed; save me, and I shall be saved.” <span
id="fr_2949"></span>[2950](#fn_2949.md) The likeness of Thy Church is that
woman who went behind and touched the hem of Thy garment, saying within
herself: “If I do but touch His garment I shall be whole.” <span
id="fr_2950"></span>[2951](#fn_2950.md) So the Church confesses her wounds,
but desires to be healed.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.vii-p7"></span>32. And Thou indeed, O Lord, desirest
that all should be healed, but all do not wish to be healed. Novatian
wishes not, who thinks that he is whole. Thou, O Lord, sayest that Thou
art sick, and feelest our infirmity in the least of us, saying: “I was
sick and ye visited Me.” <span id="fr_2951"></span>[2952](#fn_2951.md)
Novatian does not visit that least one in whom Thou desirest to be
visited. Thou saidst to Peter when he excused himself from having his
feet washed by Thee: “If I wash not thy feet, thou wilt have no part
with Me.” <span id="fr_2952"></span>[2953](#fn_2952.md) What fellowship,
then, can they have with Thee, who receive not the keys of the kingdom
of heaven, saying that they ought not to remit sins?

<span id="iv.vi.ii.vii-p10"></span>33. And this confession is indeed
rightly made by them, for they have not the succession of Peter, who
hold not the chair of Peter, which they rend by wicked schism; and this,
too, they do, wickedly denying that sins can be forgiven even in the
Church, whereas it was said to Peter: “I will give unto thee the keys of
the kingdom of heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be
bound also in heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be
loosed also in heaven.” <span id="fr_2953"></span>[2954](#fn_2953.md) And
the vessel of divine election himself said: “If ye have forgiven
anything to any one, I forgive also, for what I have forgiven I have
done it for your sakes in the person of Christ.” <span
id="fr_2954"></span>[2955](#fn_2954.md) Why, then, do they read Paul’s
writings, if they think that he has erred so wickedly as to claim for
himself the right of his Lord? But he claimed what he had re<span
id="page_335">p. 335</span> <span
id="iv.vi.ii.vii-Page_335"></span>ceived, he did not usurp that which
was not due to him.

[Next: Chapter VIII. It was the Lord's will to confer great gifts on His
disciples. Further, the Novatians confute themselves by the practices of
laying on of hands and of baptism, since it is by the same power that
sins are remitted in penance and in baptism. Their conduct is then
contrasted with that of our Lord.](2100295.md)
