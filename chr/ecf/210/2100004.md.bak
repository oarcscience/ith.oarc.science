## <span id="iii.ii-p0.1"></span>II. Notes on Secular and Church History During the Latter Part of the Fourth Century.

<span id="iii.ii-p1"></span>After the Council of Nicæa, <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.ii-p1.1"></span>a.d.</span> 325, the faith of
the Catholic Church was established, but a considerable time was to
elapse, and the tide of heterodoxy was to ebb and flow many times before
peace should finally ensue. The “conversion” of the Emperor Constantine,
though not followed, till he was dying, by baptism, led not merely to
the toleration but to the protection and, as it were, the
“establishment” of the Christian religion. This very naturally was
followed by a large influx of worldliness into the Church, and bishops
began to be time-servers and courtiers. St. Ambrose, however, was not of
this number, but whether in defence of the Catholic faith, of the
property of the Church, or, as in his legations to Maximus, for the
protection of those in peril or anxiety who sought his aid, he braved
every danger, even that of death itself.

<span id="iii.ii-p2"></span>During the greater part of the life of St.
Ambrose many of those in power, amongst others the empress mother
Justina, were Arians. Julian, though too early to affect the actions of
the bishop, apostatized to paganism, which also numbered many supporters
of high station. On the other hand, the influence of St. Ambrose,
exercised even with severe strictness, was all-powerful with Theodosius,
known as the emperor who subdued the Arian heresy and abolished the
worship of idols in the Roman Empire.

<span id="iii.ii-p3"></span>The various historical events during the
lifetime of St. Ambrose will be found entered under the different years
in the subjoined table; it remains only here to give some account of his
burial-place.

<span id="iii.ii-p4"></span>St. Ambrose having discovered the bodies of
SS. Cosmas and Damian, <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.ii-p4.1"></span>a.d.</span> 389, placed them under the right
side of the altar in his basilica, and desired that he should be himself
buried near them to the left, which was done <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.ii-p4.2"></span>a.d.</span> 397. In the year 835 the Archbishop
of Milan, Angilbert II., caused a large porphyry sarcophagus to be made
in which he laid the body of St. Ambrose between the other two under the
altar. In 1864 some excavations and repairs revealed *in situ* a
magnificent sarcophagus nearly four and a half feet in length, three in
width, and nearly two in height, without the covering, placed
lengthwise. Further excavations brought to view two other tombs, one to
the right and one to the left, lined with marble and placed east and
west, not as the sarcophagus, north and south. In the one to the left
were a few pieces of money, one of Flavius Victor, one of Theodosius,
with some fragments of cloth of gold and other things. These were
evidently the original resting-places of St. Ambrose and of SS. Cosmas
and Damian, and the sarcophagus that constructed under Lothair, <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.ii-p4.3"></span>a.d.</span> 835, by Angilbert.
