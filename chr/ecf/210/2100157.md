#### <span id="iv.ii.iv.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.v-p1"></span>The writer sums up the argument he had
commenced, and confirms the statement that unity is signified by the
terms finger and right hand, from the fact that the works of God are the
same as are the works of hands; and that those of hands are the same as
those of fingers; and lastly, that the term hand applies equally to the
Son and the Spirit, and that of finger applies to the Spirit and the
Son.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.v-p2"></span>29. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.ii.iv.v-p2.1"></span>But</span> what wonder is it if He Who
Himself needs no sanctification, but abounds therewith, sanctifies each
man; since, as I said, we have been taught that His Majesty is so great,
that the Holy Spirit seems to be as inseparable from God the Father as
the finger is from the body?

<span id="iv.ii.iv.v-p3"></span>30. But if any one thinks that this
should be referred not to the oneness of power, but to its lessening, he
indeed will fall into such madness as to appear to fashion the Father,
Son, and Holy Spirit as it were into one bodily form, and to picture to
himself certain distinctions of its members.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.v-p4"></span>31. But let them learn, as I have often
said, that not inequality but unity of power is signified by this
testimony; inasmuch as things which are the works of God are also the
works of hands, and we read that the same are the works of fingers. For
it is written: “The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament
showeth the work of His hands;” <span
id="fr_1266"></span>[1267](#fn_1266) and elsewhere: “In the beginning
Thou didst found the earth, O Lord; and the heavens are the works of Thy
hands.” <span id="fr_1267"></span>[1268](#fn_1267) So, then, the works
of the hands are the same as the works of God. There is not therefore
any distinction of the work according to the kind of bodily members, but
a oneness of power.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.v-p7"></span>32. But those which are the works of the
hands are also the works of the fingers, for it is equally written: “For
I will behold Thy heavens, the works of Thy fingers, the moon, and the
stars, which Thou hast established.” <span
id="fr_1268"></span>[1269](#fn_1268) What less are the fingers here said
to have made than the hands, since they made the same as the hands, as
it is written: “For Thou, Lord, hast made me glad through Thy work, and
in the works of Thy hands will I rejoice.” <span
id="fr_1269"></span>[1270](#fn_1269)

<span id="iv.ii.iv.v-p10"></span>33. And yet since we read that the Son
is the hand (for it is written: “Hath not My Hand made all these
things?” <span id="fr_1270"></span>[1271](#fn_1270) and elsewhere: “I
will place thee in the cleft of the rock, and I will cover thee with
Mine hand, I have placed My hand under the covering of the rock,” <span
id="fr_1271"></span>[1272](#fn_1271) which refers to the mystery of
<span id="page_140">p. 140</span> <span
id="iv.ii.iv.v-Page_140"></span>the Incarnation, because the eternal
Power of God took on Itself the covering of a body), it is certainly
clear that Scripture used the term hand both of the Son and of the Holy
Spirit.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.v-p13"></span>34. And again, since we read that the
Spirit is the finger of God, we think that fingers \[in the plural\] are
spoken of to signify the Son and Spirit. Lastly, that he may state that
he received the sanctification both of the Son and of the Spirit, a
certain saint says: “Thy hands have made me and fashioned me.” <span

[Next: Chapter VI. The Spirit rebukes just as do the Father and the Son;
and indeed judges could not judge without Him, as is shown by the
judgments of Solomon and Daniel, which are explained in a few words, by
the way; and no other than the Holy Spirit inspired Daniel.](2100158)
