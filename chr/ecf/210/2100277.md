### <span id="iv.v.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter II.

<span id="iv.v.iii-p1"></span>What those who were to be initiated
promised on entering the Church, of the witnesses to these promises, and
wherefore they then turned themselves to the East.

<span id="iv.v.iii-p2"></span>5. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.iii-p2.1"></span>After</span> this the Holy of holies <span
id="fr_2831"></span>[2832](#fn_2831) was opened to you, you entered the
sanctuary of regeneration; recall what you were asked, and remember what
you answered. You renounced the devil and his works, the world with its
luxury and pleasures. That utterance of yours is preserved not in the
tombs of the dead, but in the book of the living.

<span id="iv.v.iii-p4"></span>6. You saw there the deacon, you saw the
priest, you saw the chief priest \[i.e. the bishop\]. Consider not the
bodily forms, but the grace of the Mysteries. You spoke in the presence
of the angels, as it is written: “For the priest’s lips keep knowledge,
and they seek the law at his mouth, for he is the angel of the Lord
Almighty.” <span id="fr_2832"></span>[2833](#fn_2832) <span
id="page_318">p. 318</span> <span id="iv.v.iii-Page_318"></span>There is
no place for deception nor for denial. He is an angel who proclaims the
kingdom of Christ and eternal life. He is to be esteemed by you not
according to his appearance, but according to his office. Consider what
he delivered, reflect upon the rule of life he gave you, recognize his
position.

<span id="iv.v.iii-p6"></span>7. You entered, then, that you might
discern your adversary, whom you were to renounce as it were to his
face, then you turned to the east; for he who renounces the devil turns
to Christ, and beholds Him face to face.

divine presence and working in the water and the sacred ministers, and
then brings forward many Old Testament figures of baptism.](2100278)
