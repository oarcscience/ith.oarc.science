#### <span id="iv.i.iii.xxiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXIII.

<span id="iv.i.iii.xxiii-p1"></span>The good faith of those who are
easily bought over with money or flattery is a frail thing to trust to.

<span id="iv.i.iii.xxiii-p2"></span>117. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.iii.xxiii-p2.1"></span>Who</span> would suppose that those who
are bought over to obedience by money, <span
id="fr_548"></span>[549](#fn_548.md) or those who are allured by adulation,
would ever be faithful to them? For the former are ever ready to sell
themselves, whilst the latter cannot put up with a hard rule. They are
easily won with a little adulation, but if one reproves them by a word,
they murmur against it, they give one up, they go away with hostile
feelings, they forsake one in anger. They prefer to rule rather than to
obey. They think that those whom they ought to have placed over them
ought to be subject to themselves, as though indebted to them by their
kindness.

<span id="iv.i.iii.xxiii-p4"></span>118. What man is there that thinks
those will be faithful to himself, whom he believes he will have to bind
to himself by money or flattery? For he who takes thy money supposes
that he is cheaply held, and looked down upon, unless the money is paid
again and again. So he frequently expects his price; whilst the other,
who is met with prayer and flattery, is always wanting to be asked.

[Next: Chapter XXIV. We must strive for preferment only by right means.
An office undertaken must be carried out wisely and with moderation. The
inferior clergy should not detract from the bishop's reputation by
feigned virtues; nor again, should the bishop be jealous of a cleric,
but he should be just in all things and especially in giving
judgment.](2100087.md)
