<span id="iv.i.ii.ii"></span>

#### <span id="iv.i.ii.ii-p0.1"></span>Chapter II.

<span id="iv.i.ii.ii-p1"></span>Manifold dangers are incurred by
speaking; the remedy for which Scripture shows to consist in silence.

<span id="iv.i.ii.ii-p2"></span>5. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.ii.ii-p2.1"></span>Now</span> what ought we to learn before
everything else, but to be silent, that we may be able to speak? lest my
voice should condemn me, before that of another acquit <span
id="page_2">p. 2</span> <span id="iv.i.ii.ii-Page_2"></span>me; for it
is written: “By thy words thou shalt be condemned.” <span
id="fr_34"></span>[35](#fn_34.md) What need is there, then, that thou
shouldest hasten to undergo the danger of condemnation by speaking, when
thou canst be more safe by keeping silent? How many have I seen to fall
into sin by speaking, but scarcely one by keeping silent; and so it is
more difficult to know how to keep silent than how to speak. I know that
most persons speak because they do not know how to keep silent. It is
seldom that any one is silent even when speaking profits him nothing. He
is wise, then, who knows how to keep silent. Lastly, the Wisdom of God
said: “The Lord hath given to me the tongue of learning, that I should
know when it is good to speak.” <span id="fr_35"></span>[36](#fn_35.md)
Justly, then, is he wise who has received of the Lord to know when he
ought to speak. Wherefore the Scripture says well: “A wise man will keep
silence until there is opportunity.” <span
id="fr_36"></span>[37](#fn_36.md)

<span id="iv.i.ii.ii-p6"></span>6. Therefore the saints of the Lord
loved to keep silence, because they knew that a man’s voice is often the
utterance of sin, and a man’s speech is the beginning of human error.
Lastly, the Saint of the Lord said: “I said, I will take heed to my
ways, that I offend not in my tongue.” <span
id="fr_37"></span>[38](#fn_37.md) For he knew and had read that it was a
mark of the divine protection for a man to be hid from the scourge of
his own tongue, <span id="fr_38"></span>[39](#fn_38.md) and the witness of
his own conscience. We are chastised by the silent reproaches of our
thoughts, and by the judgment of conscience. We are chastised also by
the lash of our own voice, when we say things whereby our soul is
mortally injured, and our mind is sorely wounded. But who is there that
has his heart clean from the impurities of sin, and does not offend in
his tongue? And so, as he saw there was no one who could keep his mouth
free from evil speaking, he laid upon himself the law of innocency by a
rule of silence, with a view to avoiding by silence that fault which he
could with difficulty escape in speaking.

<span id="iv.i.ii.ii-p9"></span>7. Let us hearken, then, to the master
of precaution: “I said, I will take heed to my ways;” that is, “I said
to myself: in the silent biddings of my thoughts, I have enjoined upon
myself, that I should take heed to my ways.” Some ways there are which
we ought to follow; others as to which we ought to take heed. We must
follow the ways of the Lord, and take heed to our own ways, lest they
lead us into sin. One can take heed if one is not hasty in speaking. The
law says: “Hear, O Israel, the Lord thy God.” <span
id="fr_39"></span>[40](#fn_39.md) It said not: “Speak,” but “Hear.” Eve
fell because she said to the man what she had not heard from the Lord
her God. The first word from God says to thee: Hear! If thou hearest,
take heed to thy ways; and if thou hast fallen, quickly amend thy way.
For: “Wherein does a young man amend his way; except in taking heed to
the word of the Lord?” <span id="fr_40"></span>[41](#fn_40.md) Be silent
therefore first of all, and hearken, that thou fail not in thy tongue.

<span id="iv.i.ii.ii-p12"></span>8. It is a great evil that a man should
be condemned by his own mouth. Truly, if each one shall give account for
an idle word, <span id="fr_41"></span>[42](#fn_41.md) how much more for
words of impurity and shame? For words uttered hastily are far worse
than idle words. If, therefore, an account is demanded for an idle word,
how much more will punishment be exacted for impious language?
