#### <span id="iv.ii.iii.vii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.vii-p1"></span>To those who object that according to
the words of Amos the Spirit is created, the answer is made that the
word is there understood of the wind, which is often created, which
cannot be said of the Holy Spirit, since He is eternal, and cannot be
dissolved in death, or by an heretical absorption into the Father. But
if they pertinaciously contend that this passage was written of the Holy
Spirit, St. Ambrose points out that recourse must be had to a spiritual
Interpretation, for Christ by His coming established the thunder, that
is, the force of the divine utterances, and by Spirit is signified the
human soul as also the flesh assumed by Christ. And since this was
created by each Person of the Trinity, it is thence argued that the
Spirit, Who has before been affirmed to be the Creator of all things,
was the Author of the Incarnation of the Lord.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.vii-p2"></span>48. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.ii.iii.vii-p2.1"></span>Nor</span> does it escape my notice that
heretics have been wont to object that the Holy Spirit appears to be a
creature, because many of them use as an argument for establishing their
impiety that passage of Amos, where he spoke of the blowing of the wind,
as the words of the prophet made clear. For you read thus: “Behold, I am
He that establish the thunders, and create the wind \[spirit\], <span
id="fr_1064"></span>[1065](#fn_1064.md) and declare unto man his Christ,
that make light and mist, and ascend upon high places, the Lord God
Almighty is His Name.” <span id="fr_1065"></span>[1066](#fn_1065.md)

<span id="iv.ii.iii.vii-p5"></span>49. If they make an argument of this,
that he said “spirit” was created, Esdras taught us that spirit is
created, saying in the fourth book: “And upon the second day Thou madest
the spirit of the firmament,” <span id="fr_1066"></span>[1067](#fn_1066.md)
yet, that we may keep to our point, is it not evident that in what Amos
said the order of the passage shows that the prophet was speaking of the
creation of this world?

<span id="iv.ii.iii.vii-p7"></span>50. He begins as follows: “I am the
Lord that establish the thunders and create the wind \[spirit\].” The
order of the words <span id="page_121">p. 121</span> <span
id="iv.ii.iii.vii-Page_121"></span>itself teaches us; for if he had
wished to speak of the Holy Spirit, he would certainly not have put the
thunders in the first place. For thunder is not more ancient than the
Holy Spirit; though they be ungodly, they still dare not say that. And
then when we see what follows concerning light and mist, is it not plain
that what is said is to be understood of the creation of this world? For
we know by every-day experience, that when we have storms on this earth,
thunders come first, blasts of wind follow on, the sky grows black with
mists, and light shines again out of the darkness. For the blasts of
wind are also called “spirits,” as it is written: “Fire and brimstone
and the spirit of storm.” <span id="fr_1067"></span>[1068](#fn_1067.md)

<span id="iv.ii.iii.vii-p9"></span>51. And that you might know that he
called this “spirit,” he says: “establishing thunders and creating the
wind \[spirit\].” For these are often created, when they take place. But
the Holy Spirit is eternal, and if any one dares to call Him a creature,
still he cannot say that He is daily created like the blast of the wind.
Then, again, Wisdom herself, speaking after the mystery of the assumed
Body, says: “The Lord created Me.” <span
id="fr_1068"></span>[1069](#fn_1068.md) Although prophesying of things to
come, yet, because the coming of the Lord was predestined, it is not
said “creates” but “created Me;” that men might believe that the Body of
Jesus was begotten of the Virgin Mary, not often, but once only.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.vii-p11"></span>52. And so, as to that which the
prophet declared as it were of the daily working of God in the thunder
and the creation of the wind, it would be impious to understand any such
thing of the Holy Spirit, Whom the ungodly themselves cannot deny to
exist from before the world. Whence with pious asseveration we testify
that He always exists, and abides ever. For neither can He Who before
the world was moving upon the waters begin to be visible after the
world’s creation; or else it would be allowable to suppose that there
are many Holy Spirits, Who come into being by as it were a daily
production. Far be it from any one to pollute himself with such impiety
as to say that the Holy Spirit is frequently or ever created. For I do
not understand why He should be frequently created; unless perchance
they believe that He dies frequently and so is frequently created. But
how can the Spirit of life die? If, then, He cannot die, there is no
reason why He should be often created.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.vii-p12"></span>53. But they who think otherwise
fall into this sacrilege, that they do not distinguish the Holy Spirit;
who think that the Word Which was sent forth returns to the Father, and
the Spirit Which was sent forth is reabsorbed into God, so that there
should be a reabsorption <span id="fr_1069"></span>[1070](#fn_1069.md) and
a kind of alternation of one changing himself into various forms;
whereas the distinction between the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit always
abiding and unchangeable, preserves the Unity of its power.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.vii-p14"></span>54. But if any one thinks that the
word of the prophet is to be explained with reference to the Holy
Spirit, because it is said, “declaring unto men His Christ,” <span
id="fr_1070"></span>[1071](#fn_1070.md) he will explain it more easily of
the Lord’s Incarnation. For if it troubles you that he said Spirit, and
therefore you think that this cannot well be explained of the mystery of
the taking of human nature, read on in the Scriptures and you will find
that all agrees most excellently with Christ, of Whom it is thoroughly
fitting to think that He established the thunders by His coming, that
is, the force and sound of the heavenly Scriptures, by the thunder, as
it were, of which our minds are struck with astonishment, so that we
learn to be afraid, and pay respect to the heavenly oracles.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.vii-p16"></span>55. Lastly, in the Gospel the
brothers of the Lord were called Sons of Thunder; and when the voice was
uttered of the Father, saying, “I have both glorified it and will
glorify it again,” <span id="fr_1071"></span>[1072](#fn_1071.md) the Jews
said that it thundered on Him. For although they could not receive the
grace of the truth, yet they confessed unwillingly, and in their
ignorance were speaking mysteries, so that there resulted a great
testimony of the Father to the Son. And in the Book of Job, too, the
Scripture says: “And who knows when He will make the power of His
thunder?” <span id="fr_1072"></span>[1073](#fn_1072.md) Certainly if these
words pertained to the thunders of the heavens, he would have said that
their force was already made, not about to be made.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.vii-p19"></span>56. Therefore he referred the
thunders to the words of the Lord, the sound of which went out into all
the earth, and we understand the word “spirit” in this place of the
soul, which He took endowed with reason and perfect; <span
id="fr_1073"></span>[1074](#fn_1073.md) for Scripture often designates
<span id="page_122">p. 122</span> <span
id="iv.ii.iii.vii-Page_122"></span>the soul of man by the word spirit,
as you read: “Who creates the spirit of man within him.” <span
id="fr_1074"></span>[1075](#fn_1074.md) So, too, the Lord signified His
Soul by the word Spirit, when He said: “Into Thy hands I commend My
Spirit.” <span id="fr_1075"></span>[1076](#fn_1075.md)

<span id="iv.ii.iii.vii-p23"></span>57. And that you might know that he
spoke of the coming down of Jesus, he added that He declared His Christ
to men, for in His baptism He declared Him, saying: “Thou art My beloved
Son, in Whom I am well pleased.” <span
id="fr_1076"></span>[1077](#fn_1076.md) He declared Him on the mount,
saying: “This is My beloved Son, hear ye Him.” <span
id="fr_1077"></span>[1078](#fn_1077.md) He declared Him in His Passion,
when the sun hid itself, and sea and earth trembled. He declared Him in
the Centurion, who said: “Truly this was the Son of God.” <span
id="fr_1078"></span>[1079](#fn_1078.md)

<span id="iv.ii.iii.vii-p27"></span>58. We ought, then, to take this
whole passage either to be simply to be understood of that state in
which we here live and breathe, or of the mystery of the Lord’s Body;
for if here it had been stated that the Holy Spirit was created,
undoubtedly Scripture would elsewhere have declared the same, as we
often read of the Son of God, Who according to the flesh was both made
and created.

<span id="iv.ii.iii.vii-p28"></span>59. But it is fitting that we should
consider His Majesty in the very fact of His taking flesh for us, that
we may see His divine power in the very taking of the Body. For as we
read that the Father created the mystery of the Lord’s Incarnation, the
Spirit too created it; and so too we read that Christ Himself created
His own Body. For the Father created it, as it is written: “The Lord
created Me,” <span id="fr_1079"></span>[1080](#fn_1079.md) and in another
place, “God sent His Son, made of a woman, made under the law.” <span
id="fr_1080"></span>[1081](#fn_1080.md) And the Spirit created the whole
mystery, according to that which we read, for “Mary was found with child
of the Holy Spirit.” <span id="fr_1081"></span>[1082](#fn_1081.md)

<span id="iv.ii.iii.vii-p32"></span>60. You find, then, that the Father
created and the Spirit created; learn, too, that the Son of God also
created, when Solomon says: “Wisdom hath made herself a house.” <span
id="fr_1082"></span>[1083](#fn_1082.md) How, then, can the Holy Spirit Who
created the mystery of the Lord’s Incarnation, which is above all
created things, be Himself a creature?

<span id="iv.ii.iii.vii-p34"></span>61. As we have shown above <span
id="fr_1083"></span>[1084](#fn_1083.md) generally that the Holy Spirit is
our Creator according to the flesh in the outer man, let us now show
that He is our Creator also according to the mystery of grace. And as
the Father creates, so too does the Son create, and so too the Holy
Spirit creates, as we read in the words of Paul: “For it is the gift of
God, not of works, lest any one should boast. For we are His workmanship
created in Christ Jesus in good works.” <span
id="fr_1084"></span>[1085](#fn_1084.md)
