### <span id="v.x-p0.1"></span>Letter XLI.

<span id="v.x-p1"></span>St. Ambrose in this letter to his sister
continues the account of the matters contained in his letter to
Theodosius, and of a sermon which he subsequently delivered before the
Emperor, with the result that the Emperor, when St. Ambrose refused to
offer the Sacrifice before receiving a promise that the objectionable
order should be revoked, yielded.

<span id="v.x-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span id="v.x-p2.1"></span>The
Brother to His Sister.</span>

<span id="v.x-p3"></span>1. You were good enough to write me word that
your holiness was still anxious, because I had written that I was so, so
that I am surprised that you did not receive my letter in which I wrote
word that satisfaction had been granted me. For when it was reported
that a synagogue of the Jews and a conventicle of the Valentinians had
been burnt by Christians at the instigation of the bishop, an order was
made while I was at Aquileia, that the synagogue should be rebuilt, and
the monks punished who had burnt the Valentinian building. Then since I
gained little by frequent endeavours, I wrote and sent a letter to the
Emperor, and when he went to church I delivered this discourse.

<span id="v.x-p4"></span>2. In the book of the prophet it is written:
“Take to thyself the rod of an almond tree.” <span
id="fr_3570"></span>[3571](#fn_3570.md) We ought to consider why the Lord
said this to the prophet, for it was not written without a purpose,
since in the Pentateuch too we read that the almond rod of Aaron the
priest, after being long laid up, blossomed. <span id="page_446">p.
446</span> <span id="v.x-Page_446"></span>For the Lord seems to signify
by the rod that the prophetic or priestly authority ought to be
straightforward, and to advise not so much what is pleasant as what is
expedient.

<span id="v.x-p6"></span>3. And so the prophet is bidden to take an
almond rod, because the fruit of this tree is bitter in its rind, hard
in its shell, and inside it is pleasant, that after its likeness the
prophet should set forth things bitter and hard, and should not fear to
proclaim harsh things. Likewise also the priest; for his teaching,
though for a time it may seem bitter to some, and like Aaron’s rod be
long laid up in the ears of dissemblers, yet after a time, when it is
thought to have dried up, it blossoms.

<span id="v.x-p7"></span>4. Wherefore also the Apostle says: “What will
ye, shall I come to you with a rod, or in love and in the spirit of
gentleness?” <span id="fr_3571"></span>[3572](#fn_3571.md) First he made
mention of the rod, and like the almond rod struck those who were
wandering, that he might afterwards comfort them in the spirit of
meekness. And so meekness restored him whom the rod had deprived of the
heavenly sacraments. And to his disciple he gave similar injunctions,
saying: “Reprove, beseech, rebuke.” <span
id="fr_3572"></span>[3573](#fn_3572.md) Two of these are hard, one is
gentle, but they are hard only that they may soften; for as to suffering
from excess of gall, bitter food or drink seems sweet, and on the other
hand sweet food is bitter, so where the mind is wounded it grows worse
under the influence of pleasurable flattery, and again is made sound by
the bitterness of correction.

<span id="v.x-p10"></span>5. Let thus much be gathered from the passage
of the prophet, and let us now consider what the lesson from the Gospel
contains: “One of the Pharisees invited the Lord Jesus to eat with him,
and He entered into the Pharisee’s house and sat down. And behold a
woman, who was a sinner in the city, when she knew that Jesus sat at
meat in the Pharisee’s house, brought an alabaster box of ointment, and
standing behind at His feet, began to wash His feet with her tears.” And
then he read as far as this place: “Thy faith hath saved thee, go in
peace.” <span id="fr_3573"></span>[3574](#fn_3573.md) How simple, I went on
to say, is this Gospel lesson in words, how deep in its counsels! And so
because the words are those of the “Great Counsellor,” <span
id="fr_3574"></span>[3575](#fn_3574.md) let us consider their depth.

<span id="v.x-p13"></span>6. Our Lord Jesus Christ judged that men could
more readily be bound and led on to do the things that are right by
kindness than by fear, and that love avails more than dread for
correction. And so, when He came, being born of a Virgin, He sent forth
His grace, that sin might be forgiven in baptism in order to make us
more grateful to Himself. Then if we repay Him by services befitting men
who are grateful, He has declared in this woman that there will be a
reward for this grace itself to all men. For if He had forgiven only our
original debt, He would have seemed more cautious than merciful, and
more careful for our correction than magnificent in His rewards. It is
only the cunning of a narrow mind that tries to entice, but it is
fitting for God that those whom He has invited by grace He should lead
on by increase of that grace. And so He first bestows on us a gift by
baptism, and afterwards gives more abundantly to those who serve Him
faithfully. So, then, the benefits of Christ are both incentives and
rewards of virtue.

<span id="v.x-p14"></span>7. And let no one be startled at the word
“creditor.” <span id="fr_3575"></span>[3576](#fn_3575.md) We were before
under a hard creditor, who was not to be satisfied and paid to the full
but by the death of the debtor. The Lord Jesus came, He saw us bound by
a heavy debt. No one could pay his debt with the patrimony of his
innocence. I could have nothing of my own wherewith to free myself. He
gave to me a new kind of acquittance, changing my creditor because I had
nothing wherewith to pay my debt. But it was sin, not nature, which had
made us debtors, for we had contracted heavy debts by our sins, that we
who had been free should be bound, for he is a debtor who received any
of his creditor’s money. Now sin is of the devil; that wicked one has,
as it were, these riches in his possession. For as the riches of Christ
are virtues, so crimes are the wealth of the devil. He had reduced the
human race to perpetual captivity by the heavy debt of inherited
liability, which our debt-laden ancestor had transmitted to his
posterity by inheritance. The Lord Jesus came, He offered His death for
the death of all, He poured out His Blood for the blood of all.

<span id="v.x-p16"></span>8. So, then, we have changed our creditor, not
escaped wholly, or rather we have escaped, for the debt remains but the
interest is cancelled, for the Lord Jesus said, “To those who are in
bonds, Come out, and to those who are in prison, Go forth;” <span
id="fr_3576"></span>[3577](#fn_3576.md) so your sins are forgiven. All,
then, are forgiven, nor is there any one whom He has not loosed. For
thus it is written, that He has <span id="page_447">p. 447</span> <span
id="v.x-Page_447"></span>forgiven “all transgressions, doing away the
handwriting of the ordinance that was against us.” <span
id="fr_3577"></span>[3578](#fn_3577.md) Why, then, do we hold the bonds of
others, and desire to exact the debts of others, while we enjoy our own
remission? He who forgave all, required of all that what every one
remembers to have been forgiven to himself, he also should forgive
others.

<span id="v.x-p19"></span>9. Take care that you do not begin to be in a
worse case as creditor than as debtor, like the man in the Gospel, <span
id="fr_3578"></span>[3579](#fn_3578.md) to whom his lord forgave all his
debt, and who afterwards began to exact from his fellow-servant that
which he himself had not paid, for which reason his master being angry,
exacted from him, with the bitterest reproaches, that which he had
before forgiven him. Let us, therefore, take heed lest this happen to
us, that by not forgiving that which is due to ourselves, we should
incur the payment of what has been forgiven us, for thus is it written
in the words of the Lord Jesus: “So shall My Father, Which is in heaven,
do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his
brother.” <span id="fr_3579"></span>[3580](#fn_3579.md) Let us, then,
forgive few things to whom many have been forgiven, and understand that
the more we forgive the more acceptable shall we be to God, for we are
the more well pleasing to God, the more we have been forgiven.

<span id="v.x-p22"></span>10. And, finally, the Pharisee, when the Lord
asked him, “which of them loved him most,” <span
id="fr_3580"></span>[3581](#fn_3580.md) answered, “I suppose that he to
whom he forgave most.” And the Lord replied, “Thou hast judged
rightly.” <span id="fr_3581"></span>[3582](#fn_3581.md) The judgment of the
Pharisee is praised, but his affection is blamed. He judges well
concerning others, but does not himself believe that which he thinks
well of in the case of others. You hear a Jew praising the discipline of
the Church, extolling its true grace, honouring the priests of the
Church; if you exhort him to believe he refuses, and so follows not
himself that which he praises in us. His praise, then, is not full,
because Christ said to him: “Thou hast rightly judged,” for Cain also
offered rightly, but did not divide rightly, and therefore God said to
him: “If thou offerest rightly, but dividest not rightly, thou hast
sinned, be still.” <span id="fr_3582"></span>[3583](#fn_3582.md) So, then,
this man offered rightly, for he judges that Christ ought to be more
loved by Christians, because He has forgiven us many sins; but he
divided not rightly, because he thought that He could be ignorant of the
sins of men Who forgave the sins of men.

<span id="v.x-p26"></span>11. And, therefore, He said to Simon: “Thou
seest this woman. I entered into thine house, and thou gavest Me no
water for My feet, but she hath washed My feet with her tears.” <span
id="fr_3583"></span>[3584](#fn_3583.md) We are all the one body of Christ,
the head of which is God, and we are the members; some perchance eyes,
as the prophets; others teeth, as the apostles, who have passed the food
of the Gospel preached into our breasts, and rightly is it written: “His
eyes shall be bright with wine, and his teeth whiter than milk.” <span
id="fr_3584"></span>[3585](#fn_3584.md) And His hands are they who are seen
to carry out good works, His belly are they who distribute the strength
of nourishment on the poor. So, too, some are His feet, and would that I
might be worthy to be His heel! He, then, pours water upon the feet of
Christ, who forgives the very lowest their offences, and while
delivering those of low estate, yet is washing the feet of Christ.

<span id="v.x-p29"></span>12. And he pours water upon the feet of
Christ, who purifies his conscience from the defilement of sin, for
Christ walks in the breast of each. Take heed, then, not to have your
conscience polluted, and so to begin to defile the feet of Christ. Take
heed lest He encounter a thorn of wickedness in you, whereby as He walks
in you His heel may be wounded. For this was why the Pharisee gave no
water for the feet of Christ, that he had not a soul pure from the filth
of unbelief. For how could he cleanse his conscience who had not
received the water of Christ? But the Church both has this water and has
tears. For faith which mourns over former sins is wont to guard against
fresh ones. Therefore, Simon the Pharisee, who had no water, had also,
of course, no tears. For how should he have tears who had no penitence?
For since he believed not in Christ he had no tears. For if he had had
them he would have washed his eyes, that he might see Christ, Whom,
though he sat at meat with Him, he saw not. For had he seen Him, he
would not have doubted of His power.

<span id="v.x-p30"></span>13. The Pharisee had no hair, inasmuch as he
could not recognize the Nazarite; the Church had hair, and she sought
the Nazarite. Hairs are counted as amongst the superfluities of the
body, but if they be anointed, they give forth a good odour, and are an
ornament to the head; if they be not anointed with oil, are a burden.
So, too, riches are a burden if you know not how to use them, and
sprinkle them not with the odour of Christ. But if you nourish the poor,
<span id="page_448">p. 448</span> <span id="v.x-Page_448"></span>if you
wash their wounds and wipe away their filth, you have indeed wiped the
feet of Christ.

<span id="v.x-p31"></span>14. “Thou gavest Me no kiss, but she from the
time she came in hath not ceased to kiss My feet.” <span
id="fr_3585"></span>[3586](#fn_3585.md) A kiss is the sign of love. Whence,
then, can a Jew have a kiss, seeing he has not known peace, nor received
peace from Christ when He said: “My peace I give you, My peace I leave
you.” <span id="fr_3586"></span>[3587](#fn_3586.md) The Synagogue has not a
kiss, but the Church has, who waited for Him, who loved Him, who said:
“Let Him kiss me with the kisses of His mouth.” <span
id="fr_3587"></span>[3588](#fn_3587.md) For by His kisses she wished
gradually to quench the burning of that long desire, which had grown
with looking for the coming of the Lord, and to satisfy her thirst by
this gift. And so the holy prophet says: “Thou shalt open my mouth, and
it shall declare Thy praise.” <span id="fr_3588"></span>[3589](#fn_3588.md)
He, then, who praises the Lord Jesus kisses Him, he who praises Him
undoubtedly believes. Finally, David himself says: “I believed,
therefore have I spoken;” <span id="fr_3589"></span>[3590](#fn_3589.md) and
before: “Let my mouth be filled with Thy praise, and let me sing of Thy
glory.” <span id="fr_3590"></span>[3591](#fn_3590.md)

<span id="v.x-p38"></span>15. And the same Scripture teaches you
concerning the infusion of special grace, that he kisses Christ who
receives the Spirit, where the holy prophet says: “I opened my mouth and
drew in the Spirit.” <span id="fr_3591"></span>[3592](#fn_3591.md) He,
then, kisses Christ who confesses Him: “For with the heart man believeth
unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto
salvation.” <span id="fr_3592"></span>[3593](#fn_3592.md) He, again, kisses
the feet of Christ who, when reading the Gospel, recognizes the acts of
the Lord Jesus, and admires them with pious affection, and so piously he
kisses, as it were, the footprints of the Lord Jesus as He walks. We
kiss Christ, then, with the kiss of communion: “Let him that readeth
understand.” <span id="fr_3593"></span>[3594](#fn_3593.md)

<span id="v.x-p42"></span>16. Whence should the Jew have this kiss? For
he who believed in His coming, believed not in His Passion. For how can
he believe that He has suffered Whom he believes not to have come? The
Pharisee, then, had no kiss except perchance that of the traitor Judas.
But neither had Judas the kiss; and so when he wished to show to the
Jews that kiss which he had promised as the sign of betrayal, the Lord
said to him: “Judas, betrayest thou the Son of Man with a kiss?” <span
id="fr_3594"></span>[3595](#fn_3594.md) that is, you, who have not the love
marked by the kiss, offer a kiss. You offer a kiss who know not the
mystery of the kiss. It is not the kiss of the lips which is sought for,
but that of the heart and soul.

<span id="v.x-p44"></span>17. But you say, he kissed the Lord. Yes, he
kissed Him indeed with his lips. The Jewish people has this kiss, and
therefore it is said: “This people honoureth Me with their lips, but
their heart is far from Me.” <span id="fr_3595"></span>[3596](#fn_3595.md)
So, then, he who has not faith and charity has not the kiss, for by a
kiss the strength of love is impressed. When love is not, faith is not,
and affection is not, what sweetness can there be in kisses?

<span id="v.x-p46"></span>18. But the Church ceases not to kiss the feet
of Christ, and therefore in the Song of Songs she desires not one but
many kisses, <span id="fr_3596"></span>[3597](#fn_3596.md) and like Holy
Mary she is intent upon all His sayings, and receives all His words when
the Gospel or the Prophets are read, and “keeps all His sayings in her
heart.” <span id="fr_3597"></span>[3598](#fn_3597.md) So, then, the Church
alone has kisses as a bride, for a kiss is as it were a pledge of
espousals and the prerogative of wedlock. Whence should the Jew have
kisses, who believes not in the Bridegroom? Whence should the Jew have
kisses, who knows not that the Bridegroom is come?

<span id="v.x-p49"></span>19. And not only has he no kisses, but neither
has he oil wherewith to anoint the feet of Christ, for if he had oil he
would certainly, before now, soften his own neck.

<span id="v.x-p50"></span>Moses says: “This people is
stiff-necked,” <span id="fr_3598"></span>[3599](#fn_3598.md) and the Lord
says that the priest and the Levite passed by, and neither of them
poured oil or wine into the wounds of him who had been wounded by
robbers; <span id="fr_3599"></span>[3600](#fn_3599.md) for they had nothing
to pour in, since if they had had oil they would have poured it into
their own wounds. But Isaiah declares: “They cannot apply ointment nor
oil nor bandage.” <span id="fr_3600"></span>[3601](#fn_3600.md)

<span id="v.x-p54"></span>20. But the Church has oil wherewith she
dresses the wounds of her children, lest the hardness of the wound
spread deeply; she has oil which she has received secretly. With this
oil Asher washed his feet as it is written: “A blessed son is Asher, and
he shall be acceptable to his brothers, and shall dip his feet in
oil.” <span id="fr_3601"></span>[3602](#fn_3601.md) With this oil, then,
the Church anoints the necks of her children, that they may take up the
yoke of Christ; with this oil she anointed the Martyrs, that she might
cleanse them from the dust of this world; with this oil she anointed the
Confessors, that they might not yield to their labours, nor sink down
through weariness; <span id="page_449">p. 449</span> <span
id="v.x-Page_449"></span>that they might not be overcome by the heat of
this world; and she anointed them in order to refresh them with the
spiritual oil.

<span id="v.x-p56"></span>21. The Synagogue has not this oil, inasmuch
as she has not the olive, and understood not that dove which brought
back the olive branch after the deluge. <span
id="fr_3602"></span>[3603](#fn_3602.md) For that Dove descended afterwards
when Christ was baptized, and abode upon Him, as John testified in the
Gospel, saying: “I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove,
and He abode upon Him.” <span id="fr_3603"></span>[3604](#fn_3603.md) But
how could he see the Dove, who saw not Him, upon Whom the Spirit
descended like a dove?

<span id="v.x-p59"></span>22. The Church, then, both washes the feet of
Christ and wipes them with her hair, and anoints them with oil, and
pours ointment upon them, because not only does she care for the wounded
and cherish the weary, but also sprinkles them with the sweet odour of
grace; and pours forth the same grace not only on the rich and powerful,
but also on men of lowly estate. She weighs all with equal balance,
gathers all in the same bosom, and cherishes them in the same lap.

<span id="v.x-p60"></span>23. Christ died once, and was buried once, and
nevertheless He wills that ointment should daily be poured on His feet.
What, then, are those feet of Christ on which we pour ointment? The feet
of Christ are they of whom He Himself says: “What ye have done to one of
the least of these ye have done to Me.” <span
id="fr_3604"></span>[3605](#fn_3604.md) These feet that woman in the Gospel
refreshes, these feet she bedews with her tears; when sin is forgiven to
the lowliest, guilt is washed away, and pardon granted. These feet he
kisses, who loves even the lowest of the holy people. These feet he
anoints with ointment, who imparts the kindness of his gentleness even
to the weaker. In these the martyrs, in these the apostles, in these the
Lord Jesus Himself declares that He is honoured.

<span id="v.x-p62"></span>24. You see how ready to teach the Lord is,
that He may by His own example provoke you to piety, for He is ready to
teach when He rebukes. So when accusing the Jews, He says: “O My people,
what have I done to thee, or wherein have I troubled thee, or wherein
have I wearied thee? Answer Me. Is it because I brought thee out of the
land of Egypt, and delivered thee from the house of bondage?” adding:
“And I sent before thy face Moses and Aaron and Miriam.” <span
id="fr_3605"></span>[3606](#fn_3605.md) Remember what Balaam conceived
against thee, <span id="fr_3606"></span>[3607](#fn_3606.md) seeking the aid
of magic art, but I suffered him not to hurt thee. Thou wast indeed
weighed down an exile in foreign lands, thou wast oppressed with heavy
burdens. I sent before thy face Moses and Aaron and Miriam, and he who
spoiled the exile was first spoiled himself. Thou who hadst lost what
was thine, didst obtain that which was another’s, being freed from the
enemies who were hedging thee in, and safe in the midst of the waters
thou sawest the destruction of thine enemies, when the same waves which
surrounded and carried thee on thy way, pouring back, drowned the
enemy. <span id="fr_3607"></span>[3608](#fn_3607.md) Did I not, when food
was lacking to thee passing through the desert, supply a rain of food,
and nourishment around thee, whithersoever thou wentest? Did I not,
after subduing all thine enemies, bring thee into the region of
Eshcol? <span id="fr_3608"></span>[3609](#fn_3608.md) Did I not deliver up
thee Sihon, King of the Amorites <span
id="fr_3609"></span>[3610](#fn_3609.md) (that is, the proud one, the leader
of them that provoked thee)? Did I not deliver up to thee alive the King
of Ai, <span id="fr_3610"></span>[3611](#fn_3610.md) whom after the ancient
curse thou didst condemn to be fastened to the wood and raised upon the
cross? Why should I speak of the troops of the five kings which were
slain <span id="fr_3611"></span>[3612](#fn_3611.md) in endeavouring to deny
thee the land given to thee? And now what is required of thee in return
for all this, but to do judgment and justice, to love mercy, and to be
ready to walk with the Lord thy God? <span
id="fr_3612"></span>[3613](#fn_3612.md)

<span id="v.x-p71"></span>25. And what was His expostulation by Nathan
the prophet to King David himself, that pious and gentle man? I, He
said, chose thee the youngest of thy brethren, I filled thee with the
spirit of meekness, I anointed thee king by the hand of Samuel, <span
id="fr_3613"></span>[3614](#fn_3613.md) in whom I and My Name dwelt. Having
removed that former king, whom an evil spirit stirred up to persecute
the priests of the Lord, I made thee triumph after exile. I set upon thy
throne of thy seed one not more an heir than a colleague. I made even
strangers subject to thee, that they who attacked might serve thee, and
wilt thou deliver My servants into the power of My enemies, and wilt
thou take away that which was My servant’s, whereby both thyself wilt be
branded with sin, and My adversaries will have whereof to rejoice.

<span id="v.x-p73"></span>26. Wherefore, O Emperor, that I may now
address my words not only about you, but to you, since you observe how
severely the Lord is wont to censure, see that the more glorious you are
become, the more utterly you submit to your Maker. For it is written:
“When the Lord thy God shall <span id="page_450">p. 450</span> <span
id="v.x-Page_450"></span>have brought thee into a strange land, and thou
shalt eat the fruits of others, say not, My power and my righteousness
hath given me this, for the Lord thy God hath given it to thee;” <span
id="fr_3614"></span>[3615](#fn_3614.md) for Christ in His mercy hath
conferred it on thee, and therefore, in love for His body, that is, the
Church, give water for His feet, kiss His feet, so that you may not only
pardon those who have been taken in sin, but also by your peaceableness
restore them to concord, and give them rest. Pour ointment upon His feet
that the whole house in which Christ sits may be filled with thy
ointment, and all that sit with Him may rejoice in thy fragrance, that
is, honour the lowest, so that the angels may rejoice in their
forgiveness, as over one sinner that repenteth, <span
id="fr_3615"></span>[3616](#fn_3615.md) the apostles may be glad, the
prophets be filled with delight. For the eyes cannot say to the hand:
“We have no need of thee, nor the head to the feet, Ye are not necessary
to me.” <span id="fr_3616"></span>[3617](#fn_3616.md) So, since all are
necessary, guard the whole body of the Lord Jesus, that He also by His
heavenly condescension may preserve your kingdom.

<span id="v.x-p77"></span>27. When I came down from the pulpit, he said
to me: “You spoke about me.” I replied: “I dealt with matters intended
for your benefit.” Then he said: “I had indeed decided too harshly about
the repairing of the synagogue by the bishop, but that has been
rectified. The monks commit many crimes.” Then Timasius the general
began to be over-vehement against the monks, and I answered him: “With
the Emperor I deal as is fitting, because I know that he has the fear of
God, but with you, who speak so roughly, one must deal otherwise.”

<span id="v.x-p78"></span>28. Then, after standing for some time, I said
to the Emperor: “Let me offer for you without anxiety, set my mind at
ease.” As he continued sitting and nodded, but did not give an open
promise, and I remained standing, he said that he would amend the edict.
I went on at once to say that he must end the whole investigation, lest
the Count should use the opportunity of the investigation to do any
injury to the Christians. He promised that it should be so. I said to
him, “I act on your promise,” and repeated, “I act on your promise.”
“Act,” he said, “on my promise.” And so I went to the altar, whither I
should not have gone unless he had given me a distinct promise. And
indeed so great was the grace attending the offering, that I felt myself
that that favour granted by the Emperor was very acceptable to our God,
and that the divine presence was not wanting. And so everything was done
as I wished.
