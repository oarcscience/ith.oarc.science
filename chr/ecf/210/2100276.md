## <span id="iv.v.ii-p0.1"></span>The Book Concerning the Mysteries. <span id="fr_2828"></span>[2829](#fn_2828)

### <span id="iv.v.ii-p1.2"></span>Chapter I.

<span id="iv.v.ii-p2"></span>St. Ambrose states that after the
explanations he has already given of holy living, he will now explain
the Mysteries. Then after giving his reasons for not having done so
before, he explains the mystery of the opening of the ears, and shows
how this was of old done by Christ Himself.

<span id="iv.v.ii-p3"></span>1. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.ii-p3.1"></span>We</span> have spoken daily upon subjects
connected with morals, when the deeds of the Patriarchs or the precepts
of the Proverbs were being read, in order that being taught and
instructed by these you might grow accustomed to enter the ways of the
ancients and to walk in their paths, and obey the divine commands; in
order that being renewed by baptism you might hold to that manner of
life which beseems those who are washed.

<span id="iv.v.ii-p4"></span>2. The season now warns us to speak of the
Mysteries, and to set forth the purport of the sacraments, which if we
had thought it well to teach before baptism to those who were not yet
initiated, we should be considered rather to have betrayed than to have
portrayed the Mysteries. And then, too, another reason is that the light
itself of the Mysteries will shed itself with more effect upon those who
are expecting they know not what, than if any discourse had come
beforehand.

<span id="iv.v.ii-p5"></span>3. Open, then, your ears, inhale the good
savour of eternal life which has been breathed upon you by the grace of
the sacraments; which was signified to you by us, when, celebrating the
mystery of the opening, <span id="fr_2829"></span>[2830](#fn_2829) we
said, “Epphatha, which is, Be opened,” <span
id="fr_2830"></span>[2831](#fn_2830) that whosoever was coming in quest
of peace might know what he was asked, and be bound to remember what he
answered.

<span id="iv.v.ii-p8"></span>4. Christ made use of this mystery in the
Gospel, as we read, when He healed him who was deaf and dumb. But He
touched the mouth, because he who was healed was dumb and was a man, as
regards one point that he might open his mouth with the sound of the
voice given to him; as regards the other point because that touch was
seemly towards a man, but would have been unseemly towards a woman.

<span id="iv.v.ii-p1"></span> It must be borne in mind that the name
Mysteries was that by which the sacraments were commonly known in the
Early Church, as it is at the present day in the Greek Church the
equivalent of our word sacraments. Of course the word has also its usual
wider signification.

id="iv.v.ii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iv.v.ii-p6"></span> This “opening” was a symbolical act, as is
explained in the next section. The celebrant moistened his finger with
spittle, wherewith he then touched the ear of the catechumen, saying,
“Epphatha.”
