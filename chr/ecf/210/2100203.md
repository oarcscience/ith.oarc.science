#### <span id="iv.iv.iii.xxi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XX.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xxi-p1"></span>St. Ambrose declares his desire that
some angel would fly to him to purify him, as once the Seraph did to
Isaiah—nay more, that Christ Himself would come to him, to the Emperor,
and to his readers, and finally prays that Gratian and the rest of the
faithful may be exalted by the power and spell of the Lord’s Cup, which
he describes in mystic language.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xxi-p2"></span>132. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.iii.xxi-p2.1"></span>Howbeit</span>, now must I needs confess
the Prophet Isaiah’s confession, which he makes before declaring the
word of the Lord: “Woe is me, my heart is smitten, for I, a man of
unclean lips, and living in the midst of a people of unclean lips, have
seen the Lord of Sabaoth.” <span id="fr_1881"></span>[1882](#fn_1881)
Now if Isaiah said “Woe is me,” who looked upon the Lord of Sabaoth,
what shall I say of myself, who, being “a man of unclean lips,” am
constrained to treat of the divine generation? How shall I break forth
into speech of things whereof I am afraid, when David prays that a watch
may be set over his mouth in the matter of things whereof he has
knowledge? <span id="fr_1882"></span>[1883](#fn_1882) O that to me also
one of the Seraphim would bring the burning coal from the celestial
altar, taking it in the tongs of the two testaments, and with the fire
thereof purge my unclean lips!

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xxi-p5"></span>133. But forasmuch as then the Seraph
came down in a vision to the Prophet, whilst Thou, O Lord, in revelation
of the mystery hast come to us in the flesh, <span
id="fr_1883"></span>[1884](#fn_1883) do Thou, not by any deputy, nor by
any messenger, but Thou Thyself cleanse my conscience from my secret
sins, that I too, erstwhile unclean, but now by Thy mercy made clean
through faith, may sing in the words of David: “I will make music to
Thee upon a harp, O God of Israel, my lips shall rejoice, in all my song
to Thee, and so, too, shall my soul, whom Thou hast redeemed.” <span
id="fr_1884"></span>[1885](#fn_1884)

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xxi-p8"></span>134. And so, O Lord, leaving them
that slander and hate Thee, come unto us, sanctify the ears of our
sovereign ruler, Gratian, and all besides into whose hands this little
book shall come—and purge my ears, that no stains of the infidelity they
have heard remain anywhere. Cleanse thoroughly, then, our ears, not with
water of well, river, or rippling and purling brook, but with words
cleansing like water, clearer than any water, and purer than any
snow—even the words Thou hast spoken—“Though your sins be as scarlet, I
will make them white as snow.” <span
id="fr_1885"></span>[1886](#fn_1885)

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xxi-p10"></span>135. Moreover, there is a Cup,
wherewith Thou dost use to purify the hidden chambers of the soul, a Cup
not of the old order, <span id="fr_1886"></span>[1887](#fn_1886) nor
filled from a common Vine,—a new Cup, brought down from heaven to
earth, <span id="fr_1887"></span>[1888](#fn_1887) filled with wine
pressed from the wondrous cluster, which hung in fleshly form upon the
tree of the Cross, even as the grape hangs upon the Vine. From this
Cluster, then, is the Wine that maketh glad the heart of man, <span
id="fr_1888"></span>[1889](#fn_1888) uplifts the sorrowful, is fragrant
with, pours into us, the ecstasy of faith, true devotion, and purity.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xxi-p14"></span>136. With this Wine, therefore, O
Lord my God, cleanse the spiritual ears of our sovereign Emperor, to the
end that, just as men, being uplifted with common wine, love rest and
quietness, cast out the fear of death, have no feeling of
injuries, <span id="fr_1889"></span>[1890](#fn_1889) seek not that which
belongs to others, and forget <span id="page_223">p. 223</span> <span
id="iv.iv.iii.xxi-Page_223"></span>their own; and so he, too,
intoxicated with thy wine, may love peace, and, confident in the
exultation of faith, may never know the death of unbelief, and may
display loving patience, have no part in other men’s profanities, <span
id="fr_1890"></span>[1891](#fn_1890) and hold the faith of more account
even than kindred and children, as it is written: “Leave all that thou
hast, and come, follow Me.” <span id="fr_1891"></span>[1892](#fn_1891)

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xxi-p18"></span>137. With this Wine, also, Lord
Jesus, purify our senses, that we may adore Thee, and worship Thee, the
Creator of things visible and invisible. Truly, Thou canst not fail of
being Thyself invisible and good, Who hast given invisibility and
goodness to the works of Thy Hands. <span
