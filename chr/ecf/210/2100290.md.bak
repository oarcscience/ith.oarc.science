#### <span id="iv.vi.ii.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.iii-p1"></span>To the argument of the Novatians, that
they only deny forgiveness in the case of greater sins, St. Ambrose
replies, that this is also an offence against God, Who gave the power to
forgive all sins, but that of course a more severe penance must follow
in case of graver sins. He points out likewise that this distinction as
to the gravity of sins assigns, as it were, severity to God, Whose mercy
in the Incarnation is overlooked by the Novatians.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.iii-p2"></span>10. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.iii-p2.1"></span>But</span> they say that, with the
exception of graver sins, they grant forgiveness to those of less
weight. This is not the teach<span id="page_331">p. 331</span> <span
id="iv.vi.ii.iii-Page_331"></span>ing of your father, Novatian, who
thought that no one should be admitted to penance, considering that what
he was unable to loose he would not bind, <span
id="fr_2921"></span>[2922](#fn_2921.md) lest by binding he should inspire
the hope that he would loose. So that your father is condemned by your
own sentence, you who make a distinction between sins, some of which you
consider that you can loose, and others which you consider to be without
remedy. But God does not make a distinction, Who has promised His mercy
to all, and granted to His priests the power of loosing without any
exception. But he who has heaped up sin must also increase his
penitence. For greater sins are washed away by greater weeping. So
neither is Novatian justified, who excluded all from pardon; nor are
you, who imitate and, at the same time, condemn him, for you diminish
zeal for penance where it ought to be increased, since the mercy of
Christ has taught us that graver sins must be made good by greater
efforts.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.iii-p4"></span>11. And what perversity it is to claim
for yourselves what can be forgiven, and, as you say, to reserve to God
what cannot be forgiven. This would be to reserve to oneself the cases
for mercy, to God those for severity. And what as to that saying: “Let
God be true but every man a liar, as it is written, That Thou mightest
be justified in Thy words, and overcome when Thou art judged”? <span
id="fr_2922"></span>[2923](#fn_2922.md) In order, then, that we may
recognize that the God of mercy is rather prone to indulgence than to
severity, it is said: “I desire mercy rather than sacrifice.” <span
id="fr_2923"></span>[2924](#fn_2923.md) How, then, can your sacrifice, who
refuse mercy, be acceptable to God, since He says that He wills not the
death of a sinner, but his correction? <span
id="fr_2924"></span>[2925](#fn_2924.md)

<span id="iv.vi.ii.iii-p8"></span>12. Interpreting which truth, the
Apostle says: “For God, sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful
flesh, and for sin condemned sin in the flesh, that the righteousness of
the Law might be fulfilled in us.” <span
id="fr_2925"></span>[2926](#fn_2925.md) He does not say “in the likeness of
flesh,” for Christ took on Himself the reality not the likeness of
flesh; nor does He say in the likeness of sin, for He did no sin, but
was made sin for us. Yet He came “in the likeness of sinful flesh;” that
is, He took on Him the likeness of sinful flesh, the *likeness,* because
it is written: “He is man, and who shall know Him?” <span
id="fr_2926"></span>[2927](#fn_2926.md) He was man in the flesh, according
to His human nature, that He might be recognized, but in power was above
man, that He might not be recognized, so He has our flesh, but has not
the failings of this flesh.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.iii-p11"></span>13. For He was not begotten, as is
every man, by intercourse between male and female, but born of the Holy
Spirit and of the Virgin; He received a stainless body, which not only
no sins polluted, but which neither the generation nor the conception
had been stained by any admixture of defilement. For we men are all born
under sin, and our very origin is in evil, as we read in the words of
David: “For lo, I was conceived in wickedness, and in sin did my mother
bring me forth.” <span id="fr_2927"></span>[2928](#fn_2927.md) Therefore
the flesh of Paul was a body of death, as he himself says: “Who shall
deliver me from the body of this death?” <span
id="fr_2928"></span>[2929](#fn_2928.md) But the flesh of Christ condemned
sin, which He felt not at His birth, and crucified by His death, so that
in our flesh there might be justification through grace, in which before
there had been pollution by guilt.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.iii-p14"></span>14. What, then, shall we say to this,
except that which the Apostle said: “If God is for us, who is against
us? He who spared not His own Son, but gave Him up for us all, how has
He not with Him also given us all things? Who shall lay a charge against
the elect? It is God Who justifieth, who is he that shall condemn? It is
Christ Who died, yea, Who also rose again, Who is at the right hand of
God, Who also maketh intercession for us.” <span
id="fr_2929"></span>[2930](#fn_2929.md) Novatian then brings charges
against those for whom Christ intercedes. Those whom Christ has redeemed
unto salvation Novatian condemns to death. Those to whom Christ says:
“Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me, for I am gentle,” <span
id="fr_2930"></span>[2931](#fn_2930.md) Novatian says, I am not gentle. On
those to whom Christ says: “Ye shall find rest for your souls, for My
yoke is pleasant and My burden is light,” <span
id="fr_2931"></span>[2932](#fn_2931.md) Novatian lays a heavy burden and a
hard yoke.

[Next: Chapter IV. St. Ambrose proceeds with the proof of the divine
mercy, and shows by the testimony of the Gospels that it prevails over
severity, and he adduces the instance of athletes to show that of those
who have denied Christ before men, all are not to be esteemed
alike.](2100291.md)
