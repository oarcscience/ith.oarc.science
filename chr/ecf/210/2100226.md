#### <span id="iv.iv.v.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.

<span id="iv.iv.v.iv-p1"></span>*We are told that Christ was only “made”
so far as regards the flesh. For the redemption of mankind He needed no
means of aid, even as He needed none in order to His Resurrection,
whereas others, in order to raise the dead, had need of recourse to
prayer. Even when Christ prayed, the prayer was offered by Him in His
capacity as human; whilst He must be accounted divine from the fact that
He* commanded *(that such and such things should be done). On this point
the devil’s testimony is truer than the Arians’ arguments. The
discussion concludes with an explanation of the reason why the title of
“mighty” is given to the Son of Man.*

<span id="iv.iv.v.iv-p2"></span>26. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.v.iv-p2.1"></span>It</span> is now sufficiently made plain
that the Father is not God in solitude, without the Son, and that the
Son cannot be thought of as God alone, without the Father, for it is in
respect of His flesh <span id="fr_2149"></span>[2150](#fn_2149.md) that we
read that the Son of God was “made,” not in respect of His generation
from God the Father.

<span id="iv.iv.v.iv-p4"></span>27. Indeed, in what sense He was “made”
He has declared by the mouth of the holy patriarch, saying: “For My soul
is filled with sorrow to overflowing, and My life hath drawn near unto
hell. I have been counted with them that go down into the pit; I have
been made as a man free, without help, amongst the dead.” <span
id="fr_2150"></span>[2151](#fn_2150.md) Here, then, we read: “I have been
made as a man,” not “I have been made as God;” and again: “My soul
overfloweth with sorrows.” “My soul,” mark you, not “My Godhead.” He was
“made” in so far as that was concerned wherein He was due to hell, <span
id="fr_2151"></span>[2152](#fn_2151.md) wherein He was reckoned with
others, for the Godhead admits of no likeness which may be ground for
classing it with others. Yet mark how the majesty of Godhead shows
itself in Christ, even in that flesh which was appointed to death.
Although He was “made” as a man, and “made” as flesh, yet He was made
free amongst the dead, “free, without help.”

<span id="iv.iv.v.iv-p7"></span>28. But how can the Son say here that He
was without help, when it has already been said: “I have laid help upon
One that is mighty”? <span id="fr_2152"></span>[2153](#fn_2152.md)
Distinguish here also the two natures present. The flesh hath need of
help, the Godhead hath no need. He is free, then, because the chains of
death had no hold upon Him. He was not made prisoner by the powers of
darkness, it is He Who exerted power amongst them. <span
id="fr_2153"></span>[2154](#fn_2153.md) He is “without help,” because He
Himself, the Lord, hath by no office of messenger or ambassador, but by
His own might, saved His people. How could He, Who raised others to
life, require any help in order to raise His own body?

<span id="iv.iv.v.iv-p10"></span>29. And though men also have raised the
dead, still they did this not of their own power, but in the Name of
Christ. To ask is one thing, to command is another; to obtain is
different from bestowing.

<span id="iv.iv.v.iv-p11"></span>30. Elijah, then, raised the dead, but
he prayed—he did not command. <span id="fr_2154"></span>[2155](#fn_2154.md)
Elisha raised one to life after laying himself upon the dead body, in
accordance with its posture; <span id="fr_2155"></span>[2156](#fn_2155.md)
and, again, the very contact of Elisha’s corpse gave life to the dead,
that the prophet might foreshow the coming of Him, Who, being sent in
the likeness of sinful flesh, <span id="fr_2156"></span>[2157](#fn_2156.md)
should, even after His burial, raise the dead to life.

<span id="iv.iv.v.iv-p15"></span><span id="page_247">p. 247</span> <span
id="iv.iv.v.iv-Page_247"></span>31. Peter, again, when he healed Aeneas,
said: “In the Name of Jesus of Nazareth, rise and walk.” <span
id="fr_2157"></span>[2158](#fn_2157.md) Not in his own name, but in the
Name of Christ. But “rise” is a command; on the other hand, it is an
instance of confidence in one’s right, <span
id="fr_2158"></span>[2159](#fn_2158.md) not an arrogant claim to power, and
the authority of the command stood in the effective influence of the
Name, not in its own might. What answer, then, make the Arians? Peter
commands in the Name of Christ,—this on the one hand: on the other, they
will have it that the Son of God did not command, but requested.

<span id="iv.iv.v.iv-p18"></span>32. We read, they objected, of His
uttering a prayer. <span id="fr_2159"></span>[2160](#fn_2159.md) But take
note of the difference. He prays as Son of *Man*, He commands as Son of
*God*. Will you not ascribe unto the Son of God what even the devil has
ascribed? Will you accuse yourselves of greater wickedness than Satan’s?
The devil saith: “If Thou be the Son of God, command this stone that it
become bread.” <span id="fr_2160"></span>[2161](#fn_2160.md) Satan saith
“command,” you say “entreat.” The devil believes that, at the word of
God’s Son, the nature of an elementary substance may be exchanged for
that of a composite one; you think that, unless the Son of God prefers a
request, even His Will cannot be done. Again, the devil thinks that the
Son of God is to be esteemed from His power, <span
id="fr_2161"></span>[2162](#fn_2161.md) you that He is to be esteemed from
His infirmity. The devil’s temptations are more tolerable than the
Arians’ disputings.

<span id="iv.iv.v.iv-p22"></span>33. Let us not, then, be troubled if we
find the Son of Man entitled “mighty” in one place, and yet in another,
that the Lord of glory was crucified. <span
id="fr_2162"></span>[2163](#fn_2162.md) What might is greater than
sovereignty over the powers of heaven? But this was in the hands of Him
Who ruled over thrones, principalities, angels; for, although He was
amongst the wild beasts, as it is written, yet angels ministered to Him,
that you may perceive the difference between what is proper to the
Incarnation, and what is proper to Sovereignty. So far as His flesh is
concerned, then, He endures the assault of wild beasts; in regard of His
Godhead, <span id="fr_2163"></span>[2164](#fn_2163.md) He is adored by
angels.

<span id="iv.iv.v.iv-p25"></span>34. We have learnt, then, that He was
made man, and that His being made must be referred to His manhood.
Furthermore, in another passage of Scripture, you may read: “Who was
made for Him of the seed of David,” <span
id="fr_2164"></span>[2165](#fn_2164.md) that is to say, in respect of the
flesh He was “made” of the seed of David, but He was God begotten of God
before the worlds.

[Next: Chapter V. Passages brought forward from Scripture to show that
“made” does not always mean the same as “created;” whence it is
concluded that the letter of Holy Writ should not be made the ground of
captious arguments, after the manner of the Jews, who, however, are
shown to be not so bad as the heretics, and thus the principle already
set forth is confirmed anew.](2100227.md)
