### <span id="iv.v.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.

<span id="iv.v.iv-p1"></span>St. Ambrose points out that we must
consider the divine presence and working in the water and the sacred
ministers, and then brings forward many Old Testament figures of
baptism.

<span id="iv.v.iv-p2"></span>8. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.iv-p2.1"></span>What</span> did you see? Water, certainly, but
not water alone; you saw the deacons ministering there, and the bishop
asking questions and hallowing. First of all, the Apostle taught you
that those things are not to be considered “which we see, but the things
which are not seen, for the things which are seen are temporal, but the
things which are not seen are eternal.” <span
id="fr_2833"></span>[2834](#fn_2833) For you read elsewhere: “That the
invisible things of God, since the creation of the world, are understood
through those things which have been made; His eternal power also and
Godhead are estimated by His works.” <span
id="fr_2834"></span>[2835](#fn_2834) Wherefore also the Lord Himself
says: “If ye believe not Me, believe at least the works.” <span
id="fr_2835"></span>[2836](#fn_2835) Believe, then, that the presence of
the Godhead is there. Do you believe the working, and not believe the
presence? Whence should the working proceed unless the presence went
before?

<span id="iv.v.iv-p6"></span>9. Consider, however, how ancient is the
mystery prefigured even in the origin of the world itself. In the very
beginning, when God made the heaven and the earth, “the Spirit,” it is
said, “moved upon the waters.” <span
id="fr_2836"></span>[2837](#fn_2836) He Who was moving upon the waters,
was He not working upon the waters? But why should I say, “working”? As
regards His presence He was moving. Was He not working Who was moving?
Recognize that He was working in that making of the world, when the
prophet says: “By the word of the Lord were the heavens made, and all
their strength by the spirit of His mouth.” <span
id="fr_2837"></span>[2838](#fn_2837) Each statement rests upon the
testimony of the prophet, both that He was moving and that He was
working. Moses says that He was moving, David testifies that he was
working.

<span id="iv.v.iv-p9"></span>10. Take another testimony. All flesh was
corrupt by its iniquities. “My Spirit,” says God, “shall not remain
among men, because they are flesh.” <span
id="fr_2838"></span>[2839](#fn_2838) Whereby God shows that the grace of
the Spirit is turned away by carnal impurity and the pollution of grave
sin. Upon which, God, willing to restore what was lacking, sent the
flood and bade just Noah go up into the ark. And he, after having, as
the flood was passing off, sent forth first a raven which did not
return, sent forth a dove which is said to have returned with an olive
twig. <span id="fr_2839"></span>[2840](#fn_2839) You see the water, you
see the wood \[of the ark\], you see the dove, and do you hesitate as to
the mystery?

<span id="iv.v.iv-p12"></span>11. The water, then, is that in which the
flesh is dipped, that all carnal sin may be washed away. All wickedness
is there buried. The wood is that on which the Lord Jesus was fastened
when He suffered for us. The dove is that in the form of which the Holy
Spirit descended, as you have read in the New Testament, Who inspires in
you peace of soul and tranquillity of mind. The raven is the figure of
sin, which goes forth and does not return, if, in you, too, inwardly and
outwardly righteousness be preserved.

<span id="iv.v.iv-p13"></span>12. There is also a third testimony, as
the Apostle teaches us: “For all our fathers were under the cloud, and
all passed through the sea, and were all baptized to Moses in the cloud
and in the sea.” <span id="fr_2840"></span>[2841](#fn_2840) And further,
Moses himself says in his song: “Thou sentest Thy Spirit, and the sea
covered them.” <span id="fr_2841"></span>[2842](#fn_2841) You observe
that even then holy baptism was prefigured in that passage of the
Hebrews, wherein the Egyptian perished, the Hebrew escaped. For what
else are we daily taught in this sacrament but that guilt is swallowed
up and error done away, but that virtue and innocence remain unharmed?

<span id="iv.v.iv-p16"></span>13. You hear that our fathers were under
the cloud, and that a kindly cloud, which cooled the heat of carnal
passions. That kindly cloud overshadows those whom the Holy Spirit
visits. At last it came upon the Virgin Mary, and the Power of the
Highest overshadowed her, <span id="fr_2842"></span>[2843](#fn_2842)
when she conceived Redemption for the race of men. And that <span
id="page_319">p. 319</span> <span id="iv.v.iv-Page_319"></span>miracle
was wrought in a figure through Moses. If, then, the Spirit was in the
figure, is He not present in the reality, since Scripture says to us:
“For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus
Christ.” <span id="fr_2843"></span>[2844](#fn_2843)

<span id="iv.v.iv-p19"></span>14. Marah was a fountain of most bitter
water: Moses cast wood into it and it became sweet. <span
id="fr_2844"></span>[2845](#fn_2844) For water without the preaching of
the Cross of the Lord is of no avail for future salvation, but, after it
has been consecrated by the mystery of the saving cross, it is made
suitable for the use of the spiritual laver and of the cup of salvation.
As, then, Moses, that is, the prophet, cast wood into that fountain, so,
too, the priest utters over this font the proclamation of the Lord’s
cross, and the water is made sweet for the purpose of grace.

<span id="iv.v.iv-p21"></span>15. You must not trust, then, wholly to
your bodily eyes; that which is not seen is more really seen, for the
object of sight is temporal, but that other eternal, which is not
apprehended by the eye, but is discerned by the mind and spirit.

<span id="iv.v.iv-p22"></span>16. Lastly, let the lessons lately gone
through from the Kings teach you. Naaman was a Syrian, and suffered from
leprosy, nor could he be cleansed by any. Then a maiden from among the
captives said that there was a prophet in Israel, who could cleanse him
from the defilement of the leprosy. And it is said that, having taken
silver and gold, he went to the king of Israel. And he, when he heard
the cause of his coming, rent his clothes, saying, that occasion was
rather being sought against him, since things were asked of him which
pertained not to the power of kings. Elisha, however, sent word to the
king, that he should send the Syrian to him, that he might know there
was a God in Israel. And when he had come, he bade him dip himself seven
times in the river Jordan.

<span id="iv.v.iv-p23"></span>17. Then he began to reason with himself
that he had better waters in his own country, in which he had often
bathed and never been cleansed of his leprosy; and so remembering this,
he did not obey the command of the prophet, yet on the advice and
persuasion of his servants he yielded and dipped himself. And being
forthwith cleansed, he understood that it is not of the waters but of
grace that a man is cleansed. <span id="fr_2845"></span>[2846](#fn_2845)

<span id="iv.v.iv-p25"></span>18. Understand now who is that young maid
among the captives. She is the congregation gathered out of the
Gentiles, that is, the Church of God held down of old by the captivity
of sin, when as yet it possessed not the liberty of grace, by whose
counsel that foolish people of the Gentiles heard the word of prophecy
as to which it had before been in doubt. Afterwards, however, when they
believed that it ought to be obeyed, they were washed from every
defilement of sin. And he indeed doubted before he was healed; you are
already healed, and therefore ought not to doubt.

[Next: Chapter IV. That water does not cleanse without the Spirit is
shown by the witness of John and by the very form of the administration
of the sacrament. And this is also declared to be signified by the pool
in the Gospel and the man who was there healed. In the same passage,
too, is shown that the Holy Spirit truly descended on Christ at His
baptism, and the meaning of this mystery is explained.](2100279)
