#### <span id="iv.iv.iv.xii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XI.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xii-p1"></span>The purpose and healing effects of the
Incarnation. The profitableness of faith, whereby we know that Christ
bore all infirmities for our sakes,—Christ, Whose Godhead revealed
Itself in His Passion; whence we understand that the mission of the Son
of God entailed no subservience, which belief we need not fear lest it
displease the Father, Who declares Himself to be well pleased in His
Son.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xii-p2"></span>89. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.iv.xii-p2.1"></span>Let</span> us likewise deal kindly, let us
persuade our adversaries of that which is to their profit, “let us
worship and lament before the Lord our Maker.” <span
id="fr_2032"></span>[2033](#fn_2032.md) For we would not overthrow, but
rather heal; we lay no ambush for them, but warn them as in duty bound.
Kindliness often bends those whom neither force nor argument will avail
to overcome. Again, our Lord cured with oil and wine the man who, going
down from Jerusalem to Jericho, fell among thieves; having forborne to
treat him with the harsh remedies of the Law or the sternness of
Prophecy.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xii-p4"></span>90. To Him, therefore, let all come
who would be made whole. Let them receive the medicine which He hath
brought down from His Father and made in heaven, preparing it of the
juices of those celestial fruits that wither not. This is of no earthly
growth, for nature nowhere possesseth this compound. Of wondrous purpose
took He our flesh, to the end that He might show that the law of the
flesh had been subjected to the law of the mind. He was incarnate, that
He, the Teacher of men, might overcome as man.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xii-p5"></span>91. Of what profit would it have been
to me, had He, as God, bared the arm of His power, and only displayed
His Godhead inviolate? Why should He take human nature upon Him, but to
suffer Himself to be tempted under the conditions of my nature and my
weakness? It was right that He should be tempted, that He should suffer
with me, to the end that I might know how to conquer when tempted, how
<span id="page_236">p. 236</span> <span
id="iv.iv.iv.xii-Page_236"></span>to escape when hard pressed. He
overcame by force of continence, of contempt of riches, of faith; He
trampled upon ambition, fled from intemperance, bade wantonness be far
from Him.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xii-p6"></span>92. This medicine Peter beheld, and
left His nets, that is to say, the instruments and security of gain,
renouncing the lust of the flesh as a leaky ship, that receives the
bilge, as it were, of multitudinous passions. Truly a mighty remedy,
that not only removed the scar of an old wound, but even cut the root
and source of passion. O Faith, richer than all treasure-houses; O
excellent remedy, healing our wounds and sins!

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xii-p7"></span>93. Let us bethink ourselves of the
profitableness of right belief. It is profitable to me to know that for
my sake Christ bore my infirmities, submitted to the affections of my
body, that for me, that is to say, for every man, He was made sin, and a
curse, <span id="fr_2033"></span>[2034](#fn_2033.md) that for me and in me
was He humbled and made subject, that for me He is the Lamb, the Vine,
the Rock, <span id="fr_2034"></span>[2035](#fn_2034.md) the Servant, the
Son of an handmaid, <span id="fr_2035"></span>[2036](#fn_2035.md) knowing
not the day of judgment, for my sake ignorant of the day and the
hour. <span id="fr_2036"></span>[2037](#fn_2036.md)

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xii-p12"></span>94. For how could He, Who hath made
days and times, be ignorant of the day? How could He not know the day,
Who hath declared both the season of Judgment to come, and the
cause? <span id="fr_2037"></span>[2038](#fn_2037.md) A curse, then, He was
made not in respect of His Godhead, but of His flesh; for it is written:
“Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree.” <span
id="fr_2038"></span>[2039](#fn_2038.md) In and after the flesh, therefore,
He hung, and for this cause He, Who bore our curses, became a
curse. <span id="fr_2039"></span>[2040](#fn_2039.md) He wept that thou,
man, mightest not weep long. He endured insult, that thou mightest not
grieve over the wrong done to thee. <span
id="fr_2040"></span>[2041](#fn_2040.md)

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xii-p17"></span>95. A glorious remedy—to have
consolation of Christ! For He bore these things with surpassing patience
for our sakes—and we forsooth cannot bear them with common patience for
the glory of His Name! Who may not learn to forgive, when assailed,
seeing that Christ, even on the Cross, prayed,—yea, for them that
persecuted Him? See you not that those weaknesses, as you please to call
them, of Christ’s are your *strength?* <span
id="fr_2041"></span>[2042](#fn_2041.md) Why question Him in the matter of
remedies for us? His tears wash us, His weeping cleanses us,—and there
is strength in *this* doubt, at least, that if you begin to doubt, you
will despair. The greater the insult, the greater is the gratitude due.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xii-p19"></span>96. Even in the very hour of mockery
and insult, acknowledge His Godhead. He hung upon the Cross, and all the
elements did Him homage. <span id="fr_2042"></span>[2043](#fn_2042.md) The
sun withdrew his rays, the daylight vanished, darkness came down and
covered the land, the earth trembled; yet He Who hung there trembled
not. What was it that these signs betokened, but reverence for the
Creator? That He hangs upon the Cross—this, thou Arian, thou regardest;
that He gives the kingdom of God—this, thou regardest not. That He
tasted of death, thou readest, but that He also invited the robber into
paradise, <span id="fr_2043"></span>[2044](#fn_2043.md) to this thou givest
no heed. Thou dost gaze at the women weeping by the tomb, but not upon
the angels keeping watch by it. <span
id="fr_2044"></span>[2045](#fn_2044.md) What He *said,* thou readest: what
He *did,* thou dost not read. Thou sayest that the Lord said to the
Canaanitish woman: “I am not sent, but to the lost sheep of the house of
Israel,” <span id="fr_2045"></span>[2046](#fn_2045.md) thou dost not say
that He did what He was besought by her to do.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xii-p24"></span>97. Thou shouldst hereby understand
that His being “sent” means not that He was compelled, at the command of
another, but that He acted, of free will, according to His own judgment,
otherwise thou dost accuse Him of despising His Father. For if,
according to thine expounding, Christ had come into Jewry, as one
executing the Father’s commands, to relieve the inhabitants of Jewry,
and none besides, and yet before that was accomplished, set free the
Canaanitish woman’s daughter from her complaint, surely He was not only
the executor of another’s instruction, but was free to exercise His own
judgment. But where there is freedom to act as one will, there can be no
transgressing the terms of one’s mission.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xii-p25"></span>98. Fear not that the Son’s act
displeased the Father, seeing that the Son Himself <span
id="page_237">p. 237</span> <span
id="iv.iv.iv.xii-Page_237"></span>saith: “Whatsoever things are His good
pleasure, I do always,” and “The works that I do, He Himself
doeth.” <span id="fr_2046"></span>[2047](#fn_2046.md) How, then, could the
Father be displeased with that which He Himself did through the Son? For
it is One God, Who, as it is written, “hath justified circumcision in
consequence of faith, and uncircumcision through faith.” <span
id="fr_2047"></span>[2048](#fn_2047.md)

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xii-p28"></span>99. Read all the Scriptures, mark all
diligently, you will then find that Christ so manifested Himself that
God might be discerned in man. Misunderstand not maliciously the Son’s
exultation in the Father, when you hear the Father declaring His
pleasure in the Son.

id="iv.iv.iv.xii-p11.1"></span>. On this place Hurter observes: “We must
certainly believe that Christ, as man, knew, through His human
understanding, the day and the hour of judgment—though not by virtue of
the natural power of that human understanding. Accordingly, unless we
are without sufficient reason to charge the holy Doctor with erroneous
views, these words must be explained as meaning that Christ behaved
Himself as though He knew not the day of judgment, and as though He were
a servant, though in reality He was not a servant but the Son of God.
And truly Christ did ‘for my sake’—*i.e.* in order to set me an
example—conceal many titles and powers which He really possessed: thus,
for thirty years He did no miracle.” Cf. Bk. V. § 53. “He feigns
ignorance, that He may make the ignorant wise.”

[Next: Chapter XII. Do the Catholics or the Arians take the better
course to assure themselves of the favour of Christ as their Judge? An
objection grounded on Ps. cx. 1 is disposed of, it being shown that when
the Son is invited by the Father to sit at His right hand, no subjection
is intended to be signified--nor yet any preferment, in that the Son
sits at the Father's right hand. The truth of the Trinity of Persons in
God, and of the Unity of their Nature, is shown to be proved by the
angelic Trisagion.](2100217.md)
