<span id="iv.ii.iv.viii"></span>

#### <span id="iv.ii.iv.viii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VIII.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.viii-p1"></span>The aforesaid unity is proved hereby,
that as the Father is said to be grieved and tempted, so too the Son.
The Son was also tempted in the wilderness, where a figure of the cross
was set up in the brazen serpent: but the Apostle says that the Spirit
also was there tempted. St. Ambrose infers from this that the Israelites
were guided into the promised land by the same Spirit, and that His will
and power are one with those of the Father and the Son.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.viii-p2"></span>48. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.ii.iv.viii-p2.1"></span>And</span> we may behold this unity also
in other passages of the Scriptures. For whereas Ezekiel says to the
people of the Jews: “And thou hast grieved Me in all these things, saith
the Lord;” <span id="fr_1289"></span>[1290](#fn_1289) Paul says to the
new people in his Epistle: “Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, in Whom
ye were sealed.” <span id="fr_1290"></span>[1291](#fn_1290) Again,
whereas Isaiah says of the Jews themselves: “But they believed not, but
grieved the Holy Spirit;” <span id="fr_1291"></span>[1292](#fn_1291)
David says of God: “They grieved the Most High in the desert, and
tempted God in their hearts.” <span id="fr_1292"></span>[1293](#fn_1292)

<span id="iv.ii.iv.viii-p7"></span>49. Understand also that whereas
Scripture in other places says that the Spirit was tempted, and that God
was tempted, it says also that Christ was tempted; for you have the
Apostle saying to the Corinthians: “Neither let us tempt Christ, as some
of them tempted, and perished by serpents.” <span
id="fr_1293"></span>[1294](#fn_1293) <span id="page_142">p. 142</span>
<span id="iv.ii.iv.viii-Page_142"></span>Just was the punishment that
the adversaries should feel the venom, who had not venerated the Maker.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.viii-p9"></span>50. And well did the Lord ordain that
by the lifting up of the brazen serpent the wounds of those who were
bitten should be healed; for the brazen serpent is a type of the Cross;
for although in His flesh Christ was lifted up, yet in Him was the
Apostle crucified to the world and the world to him; for he says: “The
world hath been crucified unto me, and I unto the world.” <span
id="fr_1294"></span>[1295](#fn_1294) “So the world was crucified in its
allurements, and therefore not a real but a brazen serpent was hanged;
because the Lord took on Him the likeness of a sinner, in the truth,
indeed, of His Body, but without the truth of sin, that imitating a
serpent through the deceitful appearance of human weakness, having laid
aside the slough of the flesh, He might destroy the cunning of the true
serpent. And therefore in the Cross of the Lord, which came to man’s
help in avenging temptation, I, who accept the medicine of the Trinity,
recognize in the wicked the offence against the Trinity.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.viii-p11"></span>51. Therefore when you find in the
book of Moses, that the Lord being tempted sent serpents on the people
of the Jews, it is necessary that you either confess the Unity of the
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit in the Divine Majesty, or certainly when
the writing of the Apostle says that the Spirit was tempted, it
undoubtedly pointed out the Spirit by the name of Lord. But the Apostle
writing to the Hebrews says that the Spirit was tempted, for you find
this: “Wherefore the Holy Ghost saith this: Today if ye shall hear His
voice, harden not your hearts, like as in the provocation in the day of
temptation in the wilderness, where your fathers tempted Me, proved Me,
and saw My works. Forty years was I near to this generation and said:
They do alway err in their heart; but they did not know My ways, as I
sware in My wrath, If they shall enter into My rest.” <span
id="fr_1295"></span>[1296](#fn_1295)

<span id="iv.ii.iv.viii-p13"></span>52. Therefore, according to the
Apostle, the Spirit was tempted. If He was tempted, He also certainly
was guiding the people of the Jews into the land of promise, as it is
written: “For He led them through the deep, as a horse through the
wilderness, and they laboured not, and like the cattle through the
plain. The Spirit came down from the Lord and guided them.” <span
id="fr_1296"></span>[1297](#fn_1296) And He certainly ministered to them
the calm rain of heavenly food, He with fertile shower made fruitful
that daily harvest which earth had not brought forth, and husbandman had
not sown.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.viii-p15"></span>53. Now let us look at these points
one by one. God had promised rest to the Jews; the Spirit calls that
rest His. God the Father relates that He was tempted by the unbelieving,
and the Spirit says that He was tempted by the same, for the temptation
is one wherewith the one Godhead of the Trinity was tempted by the
unbelieving. God condemns the people of the Jews, so that they cannot
attain to the land flowing with milk and honey, that is, to the rest of
the resurrection; and the Spirit condemns them by the same decree: “If
they shall enter into My rest.” It is, then, the decree of one Will, the
excellency of one Power.

[Next: Chapter IX. That the Holy Spirit is provoked is proved by the
words of St. Peter, in which it is shown that the Spirit of God is one
and the same as the Spirit of the Lord, both by other passages and by
reference to the sentence of the same Apostle on Ananias and Sapphira,
whence it is argued that the union of the Holy Spirit with the Father
and the Son, as well as His own Godhead, is proved.](2100161)
