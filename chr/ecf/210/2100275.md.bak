### <span id="iv.v.i-p0.1"></span>Introduction.

<span id="iv.v.i-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.i-p1.1"></span>The</span> writer explains in the commencement
of this treatise that his object was to set forth, for the benefit of
those about to be baptized, the rites and meaning of that Sacrament, as
well as of Confirmation and the Holy Eucharist. For all these matters
were treated with the greatest reserve in the Early Church, for fear of
profanation by the heathen, and it was the custom, as in the case of the
well-known Catechetical Lectures of St. Cyril of Jerusalem, to explain
them to the catechumens during the latter part of Lent.

<span id="iv.v.i-p2"></span>Treatises of this kind possess therefore a
special interest, as in them we find clearly stated the full teaching of
the Church at the time when those addresses which have come down to our
times were drawn up.

<span id="iv.v.i-p3"></span>St. Ambrose goes through and explains the
greater part, first of the rites usual at the time of solemn baptism,
pointing out the deep truths and mysteries underlying these outward
things. He then treats Confirmation, referring to the seven gifts of the
Holy Spirit; and lastly, speaks of the Holy Eucharist, especially
setting forth the doctrine of the Real Presence.

<span id="iv.v.i-p4"></span>Some writers in and since the sixteenth
century have endeavoured to prove that this treatise has been falsely
attributed to St. Ambrose, but there can be no real doubt on the matter,
as is conclusively shown by the Benedictine Editors, and now universally
admitted. The treatise was composed for use during Lent, but in what
year cannot be fixed, possibly, from reference made to the treatise De
*Patriarchis,* about <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.i-p4.1"></span>a.d.</span> 387.

[Next: Chapter I. St. Ambrose states that after the explanations he has
already given of holy living, he will now explain the Mysteries. Then
after giving his reasons for not having done so before, he explains the
mystery of the opening of the ears, and shows how this was of old done
by Christ Himself.](2100276.md)
