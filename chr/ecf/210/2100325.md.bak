#### <span id="iv.vii.ii.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.

<span id="iv.vii.ii.v-p1"></span>Heaven is the home of virginity, and
the Son of God its Author, Who though He was a Virgin before the Virgin,
yet being of the Virgin took the Virgin Church as His bride. Of her we
have all been born. Some of her gifts are enumerated. Her daughters have
a special excellence in that virginity is not a matter of precept, and
that it is a most powerful help in the pursuit of piety.

<span id="iv.vii.ii.v-p2"></span>20. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vii.ii.v-p2.1"></span>It</span> is the custom in encomiums to
speak of country and parentage of the subject, that the greatness of the
offspring may be enhanced by mention of the father. Now I, who have not
undertaken to praise but to set forth virginity, yet think it to the
purpose to make known its country and its parent. First, let us settle
where is its country. Now, if one’s country be there where is the home
of one’s birth, without doubt heaven is the native country of chastity.
And so she is a stranger here, but a denizen there.

<span id="iv.vii.ii.v-p3"></span>21. And what is virginal chastity but
purity free from stain? And whom can we judge to be its author but the
immaculate Son of God, Whose flesh saw no corruption, Whose Godhead
experienced no infection? Consider, then, how great are the merits of
virginity. Christ was before the Virgin, Christ was of the Virgin.
Begotten indeed of the Father before the ages, but born of the Virgin
for the ages. The former was of His own nature, the latter is for our
benefit. The former always was, the latter He willed.

<span id="iv.vii.ii.v-p4"></span>22. Consider, too, another merit of
virginity. Christ is the spouse of the Virgin, and if one may so say of
virginal chastity, for virginity is of Christ, not Christ of virginity.
He is, then, the Virgin Who was espoused, the Virgin Who bare us, Who
fed us with her own milk, of whom we read: “How great things hath the
virgin of Jerusalem done! The teats shall not fail from the rock, nor
snow from Lebanon, nor the water which is borne by the strong
wind.” <span id="fr_3179"></span>[3180](#fn_3179.md) Who is this virgin
that is watered with the streams of the Trinity, from whose rock waters
flow, whose teats fail not, and whose honey is poured forth? Now,
according to the Apostle, the rock is Christ. <span
id="fr_3180"></span>[3181](#fn_3180.md) Therefore, <span id="page_367">p.
367</span> <span id="iv.vii.ii.v-Page_367"></span>from Christ the teats
fail not, nor brightness from God, nor the river from the Spirit. This
is the Trinity which waters their Church, the Father, Christ, and the
Spirit.

<span id="iv.vii.ii.v-p7"></span>23. But let us now come down from the
mother to the daughters. “Concerning virgins,” says the Apostle, “I have
no commandment of the Lord.” <span id="fr_3181"></span>[3182](#fn_3181.md)
If the teacher of the Gentiles had none, who could have one? And in
truth he had no commandment, but he had an example. For virginity cannot
be commanded, but must be wished for, for things which are above us are
matters for prayer rather than under mastery. “But I would have you,” he
says, “be without carefulness. For he who is without a wife is careful
for the things which are the Lord’s, how he may please God.…And the
virgin taketh thought for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy
in body and in spirit. For she that is married taketh thought for the
things of the world, how she may please her husband.” <span
id="fr_3182"></span>[3183](#fn_3182.md)
