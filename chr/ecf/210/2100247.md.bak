#### <span id="iv.iv.vi.vii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VII.

<span id="iv.iv.vi.vii-p1"></span>The doctrine had in view for
enforcement is corroborated by the truth that the Son is the Word of the
Father—the Word, not in the sense in which we understand the term, but a
living and active Word. This being so, we cannot deny Him to be of the
same Will, Power, and Substance with the Father.

<span id="iv.iv.vi.vii-p2"></span>73. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.vi.vii-p2.1"></span>To</span> return, however, to what we had
in hand before, and finish the task set before us. The Son, as the Word,
carries out His Father’s Will. Now, a word, as we understand and use it,
is an *utterance.* There are syllables and sounds, which, however, are
not at variance with the thought of our mind, and what we apprehend and
are affected by inwardly we give token of by the testimony of the spoken
word, which, as it were, works \[for us\]. But the words we speak have
no direct efficacy in themselves, it is the Word of God alone, which is
neither an utterance, nor an “inward concept,” as they call it, but
works efficaciously, is living, and has healing power.

<span id="iv.iv.vi.vii-p3"></span>74. Wouldst thou know what is the
nature of the Word—hear the Scriptures. “For the Word of God is living
and mighty, yea, working effectually, sharp and keener than any the
sharpest sword, piercing even to the sundering of soul and spirit, of
limbs and marrow.” <span id="fr_2398"></span>[2399](#fn_2398.md)

<span id="iv.iv.vi.vii-p5"></span>75. Hearest thou, then, the Word of
God, and wilt separate Him from the Father’s Will and Power? Thou
hearest Him called the living Word, the healing Word—seek not then to
compare Him with the word of our mouth; for if the word we utter, though
it have not eyes to see, nor ears to hear, yet speaks, and still the
knowledge of what it speaks is wrought by virtue of hidden mysteries of
man’s nature, how can he escape the charge of blasphemy, who requires
that some sort of bodily vision and hearing shall go along with the
Godhead in the Word of God, and thinks that the Son can do nothing of
Himself, save what He shall have seen the Father doing, though (as we
have said) there is in the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit the same Will,
both to do and not to do, and the same Power, by reason of unity in the
same substance.

<span id="iv.iv.vi.vii-p6"></span>76. But if, though men are, as a rule,
different in respect of their thoughts and feelings, they yet agree as
to the meaning of a single proposition, what ought we to think as
concerning the Father and the Son of God, seeing that in the Substance
of the Godhead there is that is imitated by human love?

<span id="iv.iv.vi.vii-p7"></span>77. Let us, however, suppose—as our
adversaries would have it—that the Son does, as it were, copy the
pattern of that which He has seen His Father doing. But <span
id="page_272">p. 272</span> <span id="iv.iv.vi.vii-Page_272"></span>even
this, we must confess, means that He is of the same substance, for none
can completely imitate the working of another, unless he be one with him
in the same nature.

[Next: Chapter VIII. The heretical objection, that the Son cannot be
equal to the Father, because He cannot beget a Son, is turned back upon
the authors of it. From the case of human nature it is shown that
whether a person begets offspring or not, has nothing to do with his
power. Most of all must this be true since, otherwise, the Father
Himself would have to be pronounced wanting in power. Whence it follows
that we have no right to judge of divine things by human, and must take
our stand upon the authority of Holy Writ, otherwise we must deny all
power either to the Father or to the Son.](2100248.md)
