<span id="iv.i.iv.xi"></span>

#### <span id="iv.i.iv.xi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XI.

<span id="iv.i.iv.xi-p1"></span>Having adduced examples of certain
frauds found in a few passages of the rhetoricians, he shows that these
and all others are more fully and plainly condemned in Scripture.

<span id="iv.i.iv.xi-p2"></span>70. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.iv.xi-p2.1"></span>I shall</span> say nothing of the snapping
of fingers, or the naked dancing of the heir, at entering on an
inheritance. <span id="fr_669"></span>[670](#fn_669.md) These are
well-known things. Nor will I speak of the mass of fishes gathered up at
a pretended fishing expedition to excite the buyer’s desires. For why
did he show himself so eager for luxuries and delicacies as to allow a
fraud of this character?

<span id="iv.i.iv.xi-p4"></span>71. What need is there for me to speak
of that well-known story of the pleasant and quiet retreat at Syracuse
and of the cunning of a Sicilian? <span
id="fr_670"></span>[671](#fn_670.md) For he having found a stranger, and
knowing that he was anxious to buy an estate, asked him to his grounds
for a meal. He accepted, and on the following day he came. There the
sight of a great number of fishermen met his eyes, and a banquet laid
out in the most splendid profusion. In the sight of the guests, fishers
were placed in the garden-grounds, where no net had ever been laid
before. Each one in turn presented to the guests what he had taken, the
fish were placed upon the table, and caught the glance of those who sat
there. The stranger wondered at the large quantity of fish and the
number of boats there were. The answer given was, that this was the
great water supply, and that great numbers of fish came there because of
the sweetness of the water. To be brief, he drew on the stranger to be
urgent in getting the grounds, he willingly allows himself to be induced
to sell them, and seemingly with a heavy heart he receives the money.

<span id="iv.i.iv.xi-p6"></span>72. On the next day the purchaser comes
to the grounds with his friends, but finds no boat there. On asking
whether perhaps the fishermen were observing a festival on that day, he
is told that, with the exception of yesterday, they were never wont to
fish there; but what power had he to proceed against such a fraud, who
had so shamefully grasped at such luxuries? For he who convicts another
of a fault ought himself to be free from it. I will not therefore
include such trifles as these under the power of ecclesiastical censure,
for that altogether condemns every desire for dishonourable gain, and
briefly, with few words, forbids every sharp and cunning action.

<span id="iv.i.iv.xi-p7"></span>73. And what shall I say of him who
claims to be the heir or legatee, on the proof of a will <span
id="fr_671"></span>[672](#fn_671.md) which, though falsified by others, yet
was known to be so by him, and who tries to make a gain through
another’s crime, though even the laws of the state convict him who
knowingly makes use of a false will, as guilty of a wrong action. But
the law of justice is plain, namely, that a good man ought not to go
aside from the truth, nor to inflict an unjust loss on any one, nor to
act at all deceitfully or to take part in any fraud.

<span id="iv.i.iv.xi-p9"></span>74. What is clearer, however, on this
point than the case of Ananias? He acted falsely as regards the price he
got for his land, for he sold it and laid at the apostles’ feet part of
the price, pretending it was the whole amount. <span
id="fr_672"></span>[673](#fn_672.md) For this he perished as guilty of
fraud. He might have offered nothing and have acted so without
committing a fraud. But as deceit entered into his action, he gained no
favour for his liberality, but paid the penalty for his artifice.

<span id="iv.i.iv.xi-p11"></span>75. The Lord also in the Gospel
rejected those coming to Him with guile, saying: “The foxes have
holes,” <span id="fr_673"></span>[674](#fn_673.md) for He bids us live in
simplicity and innocency of heart. David also says: “Thou hast used
deceit as a sharp razor,” <span id="fr_674"></span>[675](#fn_674.md)
pointing out by this the treacherous man, just as an implement of this
kind is used to help adorn a man, yet often wounds him. If any one makes
a show of favour and yet plans deceit after the example of the traitor,
so as to give up to death him whom he ought to guard, let him be looked
on in the light of that instrument which is wont to wound owing to the
vice of a drunken mind and a trembling hand. Thus that man drunk with
the wine of wickedness brought death on the high priest Ahimelech, <span
id="fr_675"></span>[676](#fn_675.md) through a terrible act of treachery,
because he had received the prophet with hospitality when the king,
roused by the stings of envy, was following him.

[Next: Chapter XII. We may make no promise that is wrong, and if we have
made an unjust oath, we may not keep it. It is shown that Herod sinned
in this respect. The vow taken by Jephtha is condemned, and so are all
others which God does not desire to have paid to Him. Lastly, the
daughter of Jephtha is compared with the two Pythagoreans and is placed
before them.](2100106.md)
