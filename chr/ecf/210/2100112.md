<span id="iv.i.iv.xviii"></span>

#### <span id="iv.i.iv.xviii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.

<span id="iv.i.iv.xviii-p1"></span>In the narration of that event
already mentioned, and especially of the sacrifice offered by Nehemiah,
is typified the Holy Spirit and Christian baptism. The sacrifice of
Moses and Elijah and the history of Noah are also referred to the same.

<span id="iv.i.iv.xviii-p2"></span>102. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.iv.xviii-p2.1"></span>We</span> form the congregation of the
Lord. We recognize the propitiation of our Lord God, which our
Propitiator wrought in His passion. I think, too, we cannot leave out of
sight that fire when we read that the Lord Jesus baptizes with the Holy
Spirit and with fire, <span id="fr_717"></span>[718](#fn_717) as John
said in his Gospel. Rightly was the sacrifice consumed, for it was for
sin. But that fire was a type of the Holy Spirit Who was to come down
after the Lord’s ascension, and forgive the sins of all, and Who like
fire inflames the mind and faithful heart. Wherefore Jeremiah, after
receiving the Spirit, says: “It became in my heart as a burning fire
flaming in my bones, and I am vile and cannot bear it.” <span
id="fr_718"></span>[719](#fn_718) In the Acts of the Apostles, also,
when the Holy Spirit descended upon the apostles and those others who
were waiting for the Promise of the Father, we read that tongues as of
fire were distributed among them. <span
id="fr_719"></span>[720](#fn_719) The soul of each one was so uplifted
by His influence that they were supposed to be full of new wine, <span
id="fr_720"></span>[721](#fn_720) who instead had received the gift of a
diversity of tongues.

<span id="iv.i.iv.xviii-p7"></span>103. What else can this mean—namely,
that fire became water and water called forth fire—but that spiritual
grace burns out our sins through fire, and through water cleanses them?
For sin is washed away and it is burnt away. Wherefore the Apostle says:
“The fire shall try every man’s work of what sort it is.” <span
id="fr_721"></span>[722](#fn_721) And further on: “If any man’s work
shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved;
yet so as by fire.” <span id="fr_722"></span>[723](#fn_722)

<span id="iv.i.iv.xviii-p10"></span>104. This, then, we have stated, so
as to prove that sins are burnt out by means of fire. We know now that
this is in truth the sacred fire which then, as a type of the future
remission of sins, came down upon the sacrifice.

<span id="iv.i.iv.xviii-p11"></span>105. This fire is hidden in the time
of captivity, during which sin reigns, but in the time of liberty it is
brought forth. And though it is changed into the appearance of water,
yet it preserves its nature as fire so as to consume the sacrifice. Do
not wonder when thou readest that God the Father <span id="page_85">p.
85</span> <span id="iv.i.iv.xviii-Page_85"></span>said: “I am a
consuming fire.” <span id="fr_723"></span>[724](#fn_723) And again:
“They have forsaken Me, the fountain of living water.” <span
id="fr_724"></span>[725](#fn_724) The Lord Jesus, too, like a fire
inflamed the hearts of those who heard Him, and like a fount of waters
cooled them. For He Himself said in His Gospel that He came to send fire
on the earth <span id="fr_725"></span>[726](#fn_725) and to supply a
draught of living waters to those who thirst. <span
id="fr_726"></span>[727](#fn_726)

<span id="iv.i.iv.xviii-p16"></span>106. In the time of Elijah, also,
fire came down when he challenged the prophets of the heathen to light
up the altar without fire. When they could not do so, he poured water
thrice over his victim, so that the water ran round about the altar;
then he cried out and the fire fell from the Lord from heaven and
consumed the burnt-offering. <span id="fr_727"></span>[728](#fn_727)

<span id="iv.i.iv.xviii-p18"></span>107. Thou art that victim.
Contemplate in silence each single point. The breath of the Holy Spirit
descends on thee, He seems to burn thee when He consumes thy sins. The
sacrifice which was consumed in the time of Moses was a sacrifice for
sin, wherefore Moses said, as is written in the book of the Maccabees:
“Because the sacrifice for sin was not to be eaten, it was
consumed.” <span id="fr_728"></span>[729](#fn_728) Does it not seem to
be consumed for thee when in the sacrament of baptism the whole outer
man perishes? “Our old man is crucified,” <span
id="fr_729"></span>[730](#fn_729) the Apostle exclaims. Herein, as the
example of the fathers teaches us, the Egyptian is swallowed up—the
Hebrew arises renewed by the Holy Spirit, as he also crossed the Red Sea
dryshod—where our fathers were baptized in the cloud and in the
sea. <span id="fr_730"></span>[731](#fn_730)

<span id="iv.i.iv.xviii-p22"></span>108. In the flood, too, in Noah’s
time all flesh died, though just Noah was preserved together with his
family. <span id="fr_731"></span>[732](#fn_731) Is not a man consumed
when all that is mortal is cut off from life? The outer man is
destroyed, but the inner is renewed. Not in baptism alone but also in
repentance does this destruction of the flesh tend to the growth of the
spirit, as we are taught on the Apostle’s authority, when holy Paul
says: “I have judged as though I were present him that hath so done this
deed, to deliver him unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that
the spirit may be saved in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.” <span
id="fr_732"></span>[733](#fn_732)

<span id="iv.i.iv.xviii-p25"></span>109. We seem to have made a somewhat
lengthy digression for the sake of regarding this wonderful mystery, in
desiring to unfold more fully this sacrament which has been revealed to
us, and which, indeed, is as full of virtue as it is full of religious
awe.

[Next: Chapter XIX. The crime committed by the inhabitants of Gibeah
against the wife of a certain Levite is related, and from the vengeance
taken it is inferred how the idea of virtue must have filled the heart
of those people of old.](2100113)
