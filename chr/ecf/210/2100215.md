#### <span id="iv.iv.iv.xi-p0.1"></span>Chapter X.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xi-p1"></span>The objection taken on the ground of
the Son’s obedience is disproved, and the unity of power, Godhead, and
operation in the Trinity set forth, Christ’s obedience to His mother, to
whom He certainly cannot be called inferior, is noticed.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xi-p2"></span>84. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.iv.xi-p2.1"></span>In</span> like manner our adversaries
commonly make a difficulty of the Son’s obedience, forasmuch as it is
written: “And <span id="page_235">p. 235</span> <span
id="iv.iv.iv.xi-Page_235"></span>being found in appearance as a man, He
humbled Himself, and became obedient even unto death.” <span
id="fr_2026"></span>[2027](#fn_2026) The writer has not only told us
that the Son was obedient even unto death, but also first shown that He
was man, in order that we might understand that obedience unto death was
the part not of His Godhead but of His Incarnation, whereby He took upon
Himself both the functions and the names belonging to our nature.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xi-p4"></span>85. Thus we have learnt that the power
of the Trinity is one, as we are taught both in and after the Passion
itself: for the Son suffers through His body, which is the earnest of
it; the Holy Spirit is poured upon the apostles: into the Father’s hands
the spirit is commended; furthermore, God is with a mighty voice
proclaimed the Father. We have learnt that there is one form, one
likeness, one sanctification, of the Father and of the Son, one
activity, one glory, finally, one Godhead.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xi-p5"></span>86. There is, therefore, but one only
God, for it is written: “Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him
only shalt thou serve.” <span id="fr_2027"></span>[2028](#fn_2027) One
God, not in the sense that the Father and the Son are the same Person,
as the ungodly Sabellius affirms—but forasmuch as there is one Godhead
of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost. But where there is
one Godhead, there is one will, one purpose.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xi-p7"></span>87. Again, that thou mayest know that
the Father is, and the Son is, and that the work of the Father and of
the Son is one, follow the saying of the Apostle: “Now may God Himself,
and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ direct our way unto
you.” <span id="fr_2028"></span>[2029](#fn_2028) Both Father and Son are
named, but there is unity of direction, <span
id="fr_2029"></span>[2030](#fn_2029) because unity of power. So also in
another place we read: “Now may our Lord Himself, Jesus Christ, and God
and our Father, Who hath loved us, and given us eternal consolation, and
good hope in grace, console and strengthen your hearts.” <span
id="fr_2030"></span>[2031](#fn_2030) How perfect a unity it is that the
Apostle presents to us, insomuch that the fount of consolation is not
many, but one. Let doubt be dumb, then, or, if it will not be overcome
by reason, let the thought of our Lord’s gracious kindliness bend it.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.xi-p11"></span>88. Let us call to mind how kindly our
Lord hath dealt with us, in that He taught us not only faith but manners
also. For, having taken His place in the form of man, He was subject to
Joseph and Mary. <span id="fr_2031"></span>[2032](#fn_2031) Was He less
than all mankind, then, because He was subject? The part of dutifulness
is one, that of sovereignty is another, but dutifulness doth not exclude
sovereignty. Wherein, then, was He subject to the Father’s law? In His
body, surely, wherein He was subject to His mother.

The profitableness of faith, whereby we know that Christ bore all
infirmities for our sakes,--Christ, Whose Godhead revealed Itself in His
Passion; whence we understand that the mission of the Son of God
entailed no subservience, which belief we need not fear lest it

Son.](2100216)
