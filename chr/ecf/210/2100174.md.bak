<span id="iv.ii.iv.xxii"></span>

#### <span id="iv.ii.iv.xxii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXII.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.xxii-p1"></span>In proof of the Unity in Trinity the
passage of Isaiah which has been cited is considered, and it is shown
that there is no difference as to its sense amongst those who expound it
of the Father, or of the Son, or of the Spirit. If He Who was crucified
was Lord of glory, so, too, is the Holy Spirit equal in all things to
the Father and the Son, and the Arians will never be able to diminish
His glory.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.xxii-p2"></span>165. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.ii.iv.xxii-p2.1"></span>It</span> is now possible to recognize
the oneness of the majesty and rule in the Father, the Son, and the Holy
Spirit. For many say that it was God the Father Who was seen at that
time by Isaiah. Paul says it was the Spirit, and Luke supports him. John
the Evangelist refers it to the Son. For thus has he written of the Son:
“These things spake Jesus, and departed and hid Himself from them. But
though He had done so great signs before them, they did not believe on
Him, that the word of Isaiah might be fulfilled which he spake, Lord,
who hath believed our report, and to whom hath the Arm of the Lord been
revealed? <span id="fr_1442"></span>[1443](#fn_1442.md) Therefore, they
could not believe, because Isaiah said again, He hath blinded their eyes
and hardened their heart, that they might not see with their eyes and
understand with their heart and be converted, and I should heal
them. <span id="fr_1443"></span>[1444](#fn_1443.md) These things said
Isaiah when he saw His glory, and spake of Him.” <span
id="fr_1444"></span>[1445](#fn_1444.md)

<span id="iv.ii.iv.xxii-p6"></span>166. John says that Isaiah spoke
these words, and revealed most clearly that the glory of the Son
appeared to him. Paul, however, relates that the Spirit said these
things. Whence, then, is this difference?

<span id="iv.ii.iv.xxii-p7"></span>167. There is, indeed, a difference
of words, not of meaning. For though they said different things, neither
was in error, for both the Father is seen in the Son, Who said, “He that
seeth Me seeth the Father also,” <span
id="fr_1445"></span>[1446](#fn_1445.md) and the Son is seen in the Spirit;
for as “no man says Lord Jesus, except in the Holy Spirit,” <span
id="fr_1446"></span>[1447](#fn_1446.md) so Christ is seen not by the eye of
flesh, but by the grace of the Spirit. Whence, too, the Scripture says:
“Rise, thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall
shine upon thee.” <span id="fr_1447"></span>[1448](#fn_1447.md) And Paul,
when he had lost his eyesight, how did he see Christ except in the
Spirit? <span id="fr_1448"></span>[1449](#fn_1448.md) Wherefore the Lord
says: “For to this end I have appeared unto thee, to appoint thee a
minister and a witness of the things wherein thou hast seen Me, and of
the things wherein thou shalt see Me.” <span
id="fr_1449"></span>[1450](#fn_1449.md) For the prophets also received the
Spirit and saw Christ.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.xxii-p13"></span>168. One, then, is the vision, one
the right to command, one the glory. Do we deny that the Holy Spirit is
also the Lord of glory when the Lord of glory was crucified who was born
from the Holy Spirit of the Virgin Mary? For Christ is not one of two,
but is one, and was born as Son of God of the Father before the world;
and in the world born as man by taking flesh.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.xxii-p14"></span>169. And why should I say that, as
the Father and the Son, so, too, the Spirit is free from stain and
Almighty, for Solomon called Him in Greek <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.ii.iv.xxii-p14.1"></span>παντοδύναμον, πᾶνέπίσχοπον</span> ,
because He is Almighty and beholds all things, <span
id="fr_1450"></span>[1451](#fn_1450.md) as we showed above to be, <span
id="fr_1451"></span>[1452](#fn_1451.md) is read in the Book of Wisdom.
Therefore the Spirit enjoys honour and glory.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.xxii-p17"></span>170. Consider now lest perchance
something may not beseem Him, or if this displease thee, O Arian, drag
Him down from His fellowship with the Father and the Son. But if thou
choose to drag Him down thou wilt see the heavens reversed above thee,
for all their strength is from the Spirit. <span
id="fr_1452"></span>[1453](#fn_1452.md) If thou choose to drag Him down,
thou must first lay hands on God, for the Spirit is God. But how wilt
thou drag Him down, Who searcheth the deep things of God?
