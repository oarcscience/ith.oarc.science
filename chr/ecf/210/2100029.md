#### <span id="iv.i.ii.xvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVII.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xvii-p1"></span>The duties of youth, and examples
suitable to that age, are next put forth.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xvii-p2"></span>65. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.ii.xvii-p2.1"></span>Since</span> it has been made sufficiently
plain that there will be punishment for wickedness and reward for
virtue, let us proceed to speak of the duties which have to be borne in
mind from our youth up, <span id="fr_107"></span>[108](#fn_107.md) that
they may grow with our years. <span id="fr_108"></span>[109](#fn_108.md) A
good youth ought to have a fear of God, to be subject to his parents, to
give honour to his elders, to preserve his purity; he ought not to
despise humility, but should love forbearance and modesty. All these are
an ornament to youthful years. For as seriousness is the true grace of
an old man, and ardour of a young man, so also is modesty, as though by
some gift of nature, well set off in a youth.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xvii-p5"></span>66. Isaac feared the Lord, as was
indeed but natural in the son of Abraham; being subject also to his
father to such an extent that he would not avoid death in opposition to
his father’s will. <span id="fr_109"></span>[110](#fn_109.md) Joseph also,
though he dreamed that sun and moon and stars made obeisance to him, yet
was subject to his father’s will with ready obedience. <span
id="fr_110"></span>[111](#fn_110.md) So chaste was he, he would not hear
even a word unless it were pure; humble was he even to doing the work of
a slave, modest, even to taking flight, enduring, even to bearing
imprisonment, so forgiving of wrong as even to repay it with good. Whose
modesty was such, that, when seized by a woman, he preferred to leave
his garment in her hands in flight, rather than to lay aside his
modesty. <span id="fr_111"></span>[112](#fn_111.md) Moses, <span
id="fr_112"></span>[113](#fn_112.md) also, and Jeremiah, <span
id="fr_113"></span>[114](#fn_113.md) chosen by the Lord to declare the
words of God to the people, were for avoiding, through modesty, that
which through grace they could do.

[Next: Chapter XVIII. On the different functions of modesty. How it
should qualify both speech and silence, accompany chastity, commend our
prayers to God, govern our bodily motions; on which last point reference
is made to two clerics in language by no means unsuited to its object.
Further he proceeds to say that one's gait should be in accordance with
that same virtue, and how careful one must be that nothing immodest come
forth from one's mouth, or be noticed in one's body. All these points
are illustrated with very appropriate examples.](2100030.md)
