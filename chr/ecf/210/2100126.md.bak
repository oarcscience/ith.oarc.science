#### <span id="iv.ii.ii.vii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.vii-p1"></span>Although we are baptized with water
and the Spirit, the latter is much superior to the former, and is not
therefore to be separated from the Father and the Son.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.vii-p2"></span>76. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.ii.ii.vii-p2.1"></span>There</span> are, however, many who,
because we are baptized with water and the Spirit, think that there is
no difference in the offices of water and the Spirit, and therefore
think that they do not differ in nature. Nor do they observe that we are
buried in the element of water that we may rise again renewed by the
Spirit. For in the water is the representation of death, in the Spirit
is the pledge of life, that the body of sin may die through the water,
which encloses the body as it were in a kind of tomb, that we, by the
power of the Spirit, may be renewed from the death of sin, being born
again in God.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.vii-p3"></span>77. And so these three witnesses are
one, as John said: “The water, the blood, and the Spirit.” <span
id="fr_886"></span>[887](#fn_886.md) One in the mystery, not in nature. The
water, then, is a witness of burial, the blood is a witness of death,
the Spirit is a witness of life. If, then, there be any grace in the
water, it is not from the nature of water, but from the presence of the
Holy Spirit.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.vii-p5"></span>78. Do we live in the water or in the
Spirit? Are we sealed in the water or in the Spirit. For in Him we live
and He Himself is the earnest of our inheritance, as the Apostle says,
writing to the Ephesians: “In Whom believing ye were sealed with the
Holy Spirit of promise, Who is an earnest of our inheritance.” <span
id="fr_887"></span>[888](#fn_887.md) So we were sealed by the Holy Spirit,
not by nature, but by God, for it is written: “He Who anointed us is
God, Who also sealed us, and gave the earnest of the Spirit in our
hearts.”

<span id="iv.ii.ii.vii-p7"></span>79. We were then sealed with the
Spirit by God. For as we die in Christ, in order to be born again, so,
too, we are sealed with the Spirit, that we may possess His brightness
and image and grace, which is undoubtedly our spiritual seal. For
although we were visibly sealed in our bodies, we are in truth sealed in
our hearts, that the Holy Spirit may portray in us the likeness of the
heavenly image.

<span id="iv.ii.ii.vii-p8"></span>80. Who, then, can dare to say that
the Holy Spirit is separated from the Father and the Son, since through
Him we attain to the image and likeness of God, and through Him, as the
Apostle Peter says, are partakers of the divine nature? In which there
is certainly not the inheritance of carnal succession, but the spiritual
connection of the grace of adoption. And in order that we may know that
this seal is rather on our hearts than on our bodies, the prophet says:
“The light of Thy countenance has been impressed upon us, O Lord, Thou
hast put gladness in my heart.” <span id="fr_888"></span>[889](#fn_888.md)

[Next: Chapter VII. The Holy Spirit is not a creature, seeing that He is
infinite, and was shed upon the apostles dispersed through all
countries, and moreover sanctifies the Angels also, to whom He makes us
equal. Mary was full of the same likewise, so too, Christ the Lord, and
so far all things high and low. And all benediction has its origin from
His operation, as was signified in the moving of the water at
Bethesda.](2100127.md)
