## <span id="v.i-p0.1"></span>Selections from the Letters of St. Ambrose.

### <span id="v.i-p0.3"></span>Memorial of Symmachus, the Prefect of the City.

<span id="v.i-p1"></span>Symmachus in the name of the heathen members of
the Senate asks that the Altar of Victory, which had been removed by
Gratian, should be restored in the Senate House, and that oaths should
be taken there as of old. He argues that the example of former Emperors
should be followed as to the things which they retained, not which they
abolished. Rome expects this of them, and no injury can accrue to the
treasury in consequence, whereas it is unjust to confiscate legacies to
the Vestal Virgins and ancient rites.

<span id="v.i-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="v.i-p2.1"></span>There</span> was a determined move on the part of
Symmachus, Prefect of the city, and other heathen to regain the
observances of their religion. He was perhaps the leading man of the day
at Rome, equally renowned as a statesman, a scholar, and an orator. In
<span class="sc"><span id="v.i-p2.2"></span>a.d.</span> 382 he headed a
deputation of the Senate to the Emperor Gratian to request the
replacement of the Altar of Victory in the Senate House, and the
restoration of their endowments to the Vestal Virgins and the colleges
of priests. There was a counterpetition on the part of the Christian
senators forwarded through Pope Damasus, and Gratian refused to receive
the deputation. In 384 the attempt was repeated, and these letters or
memorials have to do with this application to Valentinian II., the
brother of Gratian, who was now Emperor of the West; this attempt was
also foiled.

<span id="v.i-p3"></span>It would seem that he took part in missions for
the same purpose to Theodosius after the defeat of Maximus, and to
Valentinian II. in <span class="sc"><span
id="v.i-p3.1"></span>a.d.</span> 392, and again unsuccessfully. In the
next year, Eugenius, who had been made Emperor by Flavian and
Arbogastes, restored the Altar of Victory, which however was finally
removed by Theodosius after the defeat of Eugenius and Arbogastes.
Probably Symmachus made a final attempt in 403 or 404, but fruitlessly.
\[See *Dict. Christ. Biog.* s.v. Symmachus.\]

<span id="v.i-p4"></span>The statue and Altar of Victory in question had
been first removed by Constantius, son of Constantine, when at Rome,
<span class="sc"><span id="v.i-p4.1"></span>a.d.</span> 356, but were
restored by Julian with other heathen symbols and rites. Valentinian I.
tolerated them, but possibly (at any rate for some time), as St. Ambrose
says, did so in ignorance \[Ep. XVII. 16\]. They were once more removed
by Gratian, and then the action of Symmachus comes in. It may be
mentioned that though a heathen he was on intimate terms with Damasus,
St. Ambrose, and many leading Christians.

<span id="v.i-p5"></span>The three Epistles or rather “Memorials” which
follow refer to this part of the death-struggle of paganism.
