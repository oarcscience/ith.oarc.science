#### <span id="iv.ii.iv.x-p0.1"></span>Chapter X.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.x-p1"></span>The Divinity of the Holy Spirit is
supported by a passage of St. John. This passage was, indeed, erased by
heretics, but it is a vain attempt, since their faithlessness could
thereby more easily be convicted. The order of the context is considered
in order that this passage may be shown to refer to the Spirit. He is
born of the Spirit who is born again of the same Spirit, of Whom Christ
Himself is believed to have been born and born again. Again, the Godhead
of the Spirit is inferred from two testimonies of St. John; and lastly,
it is explained how the Spirit, the water, and the blood are called
witnesses.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.x-p2"></span>59. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.ii.iv.x-p2.1"></span>Nor</span> does the Scripture in this place
alone bear witness to the <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.ii.iv.x-p2.2"></span>θεότης</span>, that is, the Godhead of the
Holy Spirit; but also the Lord Himself said in the Gospel: “The Spirit
is God.” <span id="fr_1304"></span>[1305](#fn_1304.md) Which passage you,
Arians, so expressly testify to be said concerning the Spirit, that you
remove it from your copies, <span id="fr_1305"></span>[1306](#fn_1305.md)
and would that it were from yours and not also from those of the Church!
For at the time when Auxentius <span
id="fr_1306"></span>[1307](#fn_1306.md) had seized the Church of Milan with
the arms and forces of impious unbelief, the Church of Sirmium <span
id="fr_1307"></span>[1308](#fn_1307.md) was attacked by Valens and
Ursatius, when their priests \[i.e. bishops\] failed in faith; this
falsehood and sacrilege of yours was found in the ecclesiastical books.
And it may chance that you did the same in the past.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.x-p7"></span>60. And you have indeed been able to
blot out the letters, but could not remove the faith. That erasure
betrayed you more, that erasure condemned you more; and you were not
able to obliterate the truth, but that erasure blotted out your names
from the book of life. Why was the passage removed, “For God is a
Spirit,” if it did not pertain to the Spirit? For if you will have it
that the expression is used of God the Father, you, who think it should
be erased, deny, in consequence, God the Father. Choose which you will,
in each the snare of your own impiety will bind you if you confess
yourselves to be heathen by denying either the Father or the Spirit to
be God. Therefore your confession wherein you have blotted out the Word
of God remains, while you fear the original.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.x-p8"></span>61. You have blotted it out, indeed, in
your breasts and minds, but the Word of <span id="page_144">p.
144</span> <span id="iv.ii.iv.x-Page_144"></span>God is not blotted out,
the Holy Spirit is not blotted out, but turns away from impious minds;
not grace but iniquity is blotted out; for it is written: “I am He, I am
He that blot out thine iniquities.” <span
id="fr_1308"></span>[1309](#fn_1308.md) Lastly, Moses, making request for
the people, says: “Blot me out of Thy book, if Thou sparest not this
people.” <span id="fr_1309"></span>[1310](#fn_1309.md) And yet he was not
blotted out, because he had no iniquity, but grace flowed forth.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.x-p11"></span>62. You are, then, convicted by your
own confession that you cannot say it was done with wisdom but with
cunning. For by cunning you know that you are convicted by the evidence
of that passage, and that your arguments cannot apply against that
testimony. For whence else could the meaning of that place be derived,
since the whole tenour of the passage is concerning the Spirit?

<span id="iv.ii.iv.x-p12"></span>63. Nicodemus enquires about
regeneration, and the Lord replies: “Verily, verily, I say unto thee,
except a man be born again by water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into
the kingdom of God.” <span id="fr_1310"></span>[1311](#fn_1310.md) And that
He might show that there is one birth according to the flesh, and
another according to the Spirit, He added: “That which is born of the
flesh is flesh, because it is born of the flesh; and that which is born
of the Spirit is Spirit, because the Spirit is God.” <span
id="fr_1311"></span>[1312](#fn_1311.md) Follow out the whole course of the
passage, and you will find that God has shut out your impiety by the
fulness of His statement: “Marvel not,” says He, “that I said, Ye must
be born again. The Spirit breatheth where He listeth, and thou hearest
His voice, but knowest not whence He cometh or whither He goeth, so is
every one who is born of the Spirit.” <span
id="fr_1312"></span>[1313](#fn_1312.md)

<span id="iv.ii.iv.x-p16"></span>64. Who is he who is born of the
Spirit, and is made Spirit, but he who is renewed in the Spirit of his
mind? <span id="fr_1313"></span>[1314](#fn_1313.md) This certainly is he
who is regenerated by water and the Holy Spirit, since we receive the
hope of eternal life through the laver of regeneration and renewing of
the Holy Spirit. <span id="fr_1314"></span>[1315](#fn_1314.md) And
elsewhere the Apostle Peter says: “Ye shall be baptized with the Holy
Spirit.” <span id="fr_1315"></span>[1316](#fn_1315.md) For who is he that
is baptized with the Holy Spirit but he who is born again through water
and the Holy Spirit? Therefore the Lord said of the Holy Spirit, Verily,
verily, I say unto thee, except a man be born again by water and the
Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. And therefore He
declared that we are born of Him in the latter case, through Whom He
said that we were born in the former. This is the sentence of the Lord;
I rest on what is written, not on argument.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.x-p20"></span>65. I ask, however, why, if there be no
doubt that we are born again by the Holy Spirit, there should be any
doubt that we are born of the Holy Spirit, since the Lord Jesus Himself
was both born and born again of the Holy Spirit. And if you confess that
He was born of the Holy Spirit, because you are not able to deny it, but
deny that He was born again, it is great folly to confess what is
peculiar to God, and deny what is common to men. And therefore that is
well said to you which was said to the Jews: “If I told you earthly
things and ye believe not, how shall ye believe if I tell you heavenly
things?” <span id="fr_1316"></span>[1317](#fn_1316.md)

<span id="iv.ii.iv.x-p22"></span>66. And yet we find each passage so
written in Greek, that He said not, *through* the Spirit, but *of* the
Spirit. For it stands thus: <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.ii.iv.x-p22.1"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.ii.iv.x-p22.2"></span>μήν, ἀμήν, λέγω σοι, ἐὰν μή τις γεννηθῇ ἐξ
ὓδατος και Πνεύματος</span>, that is, *of water and the Spirit.*
Therefore, since one ought not to doubt that “that which is born of the
Spirit” is written of the Holy Spirit; there is no doubt but that the
Holy Spirit also is God, according to that which is written, “the Spirit
is God.”

<span id="iv.ii.iv.x-p23"></span>67. But the same Evangelist, that he
might make it plain that he wrote this concerning the Holy Spirit, says
elsewhere: “Jesus Christ came by water and blood, not in the water only,
but by water and blood. And the Spirit beareth witness, because the
Spirit is truth; for there are three witnesses, the Spirit, the water,
and the blood; and these three are one.” <span
id="fr_1317"></span>[1318](#fn_1317.md)

<span id="iv.ii.iv.x-p25"></span>68. Hear how they are witnesses: The
Spirit renews the mind, the water is serviceable for the laver, and the
blood refers to the price. For the Spirit made us children by adoption,
the water of the sacred Font washed us, the blood of the Lord redeemed
us. So we obtain one invisible and one visible testimony in a spiritual
sacrament, for “the Spirit Himself beareth witness to our spirit.” <span
id="fr_1318"></span>[1319](#fn_1318.md) Though the fulness of the sacrament
be in each, yet there is a distinction of office; so where there is
distinction of office, there certainly is not equality of witness.

illustration of the groundlessness of such accusations of wilful
corruption of Scripture. The words in question have no Greek authority
at all, and are obviously a comment.” Westcott on S. [John v.

priest <span class="sc"><span id="iv.ii.iv.x-p5.1"></span>a.d.</span>
343 by Gregory, the violent opponent of St. Athanasius. After the synod
of Milan <span class="sc"><span id="iv.ii.iv.x-p5.2"></span>a.d.</span>
355, when the bishop of that see, Dionysius, having refused to renounce
Athanasius and the Nicene faith, was banished, Auxentius was forcibly
intruded as bishop, and, in spite of the efforts of St. Hilary of
Poitiers and other Catholics, maintained his position till his death in
374.

<span id="iv.ii.iv.x-p6"></span> The reference must be to the synods of
Sirmium. In one held <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.ii.iv.x-p6.1"></span>a.d.</span> 351, against Photinus, there was
a great attempt to make the semi-Arians appear orthodox, and St. Hilary
accepted, while St. Athanasius rejected, their formula. Another synod
was held <span class="sc"><span id="iv.ii.iv.x-p6.2"></span>a.d.</span>
357, when the aged Hosius was tormented into accepting a formula, called
by St. Hilary the “Sirmian blasphemy.” Another, no less injurious to the
faith, was held in 358, by the desire of Constantius. During this
time—but forgeries and the loss of some patristic writings make the
history of the whole period somewhat uncertain—dates the weakness of
Liberius, so that St. Ambrose may well speak of *nutantibus
sacerdotibus.* See Hefele, *Conc. Geschichte*, I. on the Sirmian synods;
Athanasius, Vol. IV. in this series, p. 464 ff.; *Dict. Chr. Biog.* III.

[Next: Chapter XI. The objection has been made, that the words of St.
John, “The Spirit is God,” are to be referred to God the Father; since
Christ afterwards declares that God is to be worshipped in Spirit and in
truth. The answer is, first, that by the word Spirit is sometimes meant
spiritual grace; next, it is shown that, if they insist that the Person
of the Holy Spirit is signified by the words “in Spirit,” and therefore
deny that adoration is due to Him, the argument tells equally against
the Son; and since numberless passages prove that He is to be
worshipped, we understand from this that the same rule is to be laid
down as regards the Spirit. Why are we commanded to fall down before His
footstool? Because by this is signified the Lord's Body, and as the
Spirit was the Maker of this, it follows that He is to be worshipped,
and yet it does not accordingly follow that Mary is to be worshipped.
Therefore the worship of the Spirit is not done away with, but His union
with the Father is ex](2100163.md)
