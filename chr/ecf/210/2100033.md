#### <span id="iv.i.ii.xxi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXI.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxi-p1"></span>We must guard against anger, before it
arises; if it has already arisen we must check and calm it, and if we
cannot do this either, at least we should keep our tongue from abuse, so
that our passions may be like boys’ quarrels. He relates what Archites
said, and shows that David led the way in this matter, both in his
actions and in his writings.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxi-p2"></span>90. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.ii.xxi-p2.1"></span>Let</span> anger be guarded against. <span
id="fr_134"></span>[135](#fn_134) If it cannot, however, be averted, let
it be kept within bounds. For indignation is a terrible incentive to
sin. It disorders the mind to such an extent as to leave no room for
reason. The first thing, therefore, to aim at, if possible, is to make
tranquillity of character our natural disposition by constant practice,
by desire for better things, by fixed determination. But since passion
is to a large extent implanted in our nature and character, so that it
cannot be uprooted and avoided, it must be checked by reason, if, that
is, it can be foreseen. And if the mind has already been filled with
indignation before it could be foreseen or provided against in any way,
we must consider how to conquer the passion of the mind, how to restrain
our anger, that it may no more be so filled. Resist wrath, if possible;
if not, give way, for it is written: “Give place to wrath.” <span
id="fr_135"></span>[136](#fn_135)

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxi-p5"></span>91. Jacob dutifully gave way to his
brother when angry, and to Rebecca; that is to say, taught by counsels
of patience, he preferred to go away and live in foreign lands, rather
than to arouse his brother’s anger; and then to return only when he
thought his brother was appeased. <span
id="fr_136"></span>[137](#fn_136) Thus it was that he found such great
grace with God. With what offers of willing service, with what gifts,
did he reconcile his brother to himself again, so that he should not
remember the blessing which had been taken away from him, but should
only remember the reparation now offered? <span
id="fr_137"></span>[138](#fn_137)

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxi-p8"></span>92. If, then, anger has got the start,
and has already taken possession of thy mind, and mounted into thy
heart, forsake not thy ground. Thy ground is patience, it is wisdom, it
is reason, it is the allaying of indignation. And if the stubbornness of
thy opponent rouses thee, and his perverseness drives thee to
indignation: if thou canst not calm thy mind, check at least thy tongue.
For so it is written: “Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips that they
speak no guile. Seek peace and pursue it.” <span
id="fr_138"></span>[139](#fn_138) See the peace of holy Jacob, how great
it was! First, then, calm thy mind. If thou canst not do this, put a
restraint upon thy tongue. Lastly, omit not to seek for reconciliation.
These ideas the speakers of the world have borrowed from us, and have
set down in their writings. But he who said it first has the credit of
understanding its meaning.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxi-p10"></span>93. Let us then avoid or at any rate
check anger, so that we may not lose our share of praise, nor yet add to
our list of sins. It is no light thing to calm one’s anger. It is no
less difficult a thing than it is not to be roused at all. The one is an
act of our own will, the other is an effect of nature. So quarrels among
boys are harmless, and have more of a pleasant than a bitter character
about them. And if boys quickly come to quarrel one with the other, they
are easily calmed down again, and quickly come together with even
greater friendliness. They do not know how to act deceitfully and
artfully. Do not condemn these children, of whom the Lord says: “Except
ye be converted and become as this child, ye shall not enter into the
kingdom of heaven.” <span id="fr_139"></span>[140](#fn_139) So also the
Lord Himself, Who is the Power of God, as a Boy, when He was reviled,
reviled not again, <span id="page_17">p. 17</span> <span
id="iv.i.ii.xxi-Page_17"></span>when He was struck, struck not
back. <span id="fr_140"></span>[141](#fn_140) Set then thy mind on
this—like a child never to keep an injury in mind, never to show malice,
but that all things may be done blamelessly by thee. Regard not the
return made thee by others. Hold thy ground. Guard the simplicity and
purity of thy heart. Answer not an angry man according to his anger, nor
a foolish man according to his folly. One fault quickly calls forth
another. If stones are rubbed together, does not fire break forth?

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxi-p13"></span>94. The heathen—(they are wont to
exaggerate everything in speaking)—make much of the saying of the
philosopher Archites <span id="fr_141"></span>[142](#fn_141) of
Tarentum, which he spoke to his bailiff: “O you wretched man, how I
would punish you, if I were not angry.” But David already before this
had in his indignation held back his armed hand. How much greater a
thing it is not to revile again, than not to avenge oneself! The
warriors, too, prepared to take vengeance against Nabal, Abigail
restrained by her prayers. <span id="fr_142"></span>[143](#fn_142) From
whence we perceive that we ought not only to yield to timely entreaties,
but also to be pleased with them. So much was David pleased that he
blessed her who intervened, because he was restrained from his desire
for revenge.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxi-p16"></span>95. Already before this he had said of
his enemies: “For they cast iniquity upon me, and in their wrath they
were grievous to me.” <span id="fr_143"></span>[144](#fn_143) Let us
hear what he said when overwhelmed in wrath: “Who will give me wings
like a dove, and I will flee away and be at rest.” <span
id="fr_144"></span>[145](#fn_144) They kept provoking him to anger, but
he sought quietness.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxi-p19"></span>96. He had also said: “Be ye angry and
sin not.” <span id="fr_145"></span>[146](#fn_145) The moral teacher who
knew that the natural disposition should rather be guided by a
reasonable course of teaching, than be eradicated, teaches morals, and
says: “Be angry where there is a fault against which ye ought to be
angry.” For it is impossible not to be roused up by the baseness of many
things; <span id="fr_146"></span>[147](#fn_146) otherwise we might be
accounted, not virtuous, but apathetic and neglectful. Be angry
therefore, so that ye keep free from fault, or, in other words: If ye
are angry, do not sin, but overcome wrath with reason. Or one might put
it thus: If ye are angry, be angry with yourselves, because ye are
roused, and ye will not sin. For he who is angry with himself, because
he has been so easily roused, ceases to be angry with another. But he
who wishes to prove his anger is righteous only gets the more inflamed,
and quickly falls into sin. “Better is he,” as Solomon says, “that
restraineth his anger, than he that taketh a city,” <span
id="fr_147"></span>[148](#fn_147) for anger leads astray even brave men.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xxi-p23"></span>97. We ought therefore to take care
that we do not get into a flurry, before reason prepares our minds. For
oftentimes anger or distress or fear of death almost deprives the soul
of life, and beats it down by a sudden blow. It is therefore a good
thing to anticipate this by reflection, and to exercise the mind by
considering the matter. So the mind will not be roused by any sudden
disturbance, but will grow calm, being held in by the yoke and reins of
reason.
