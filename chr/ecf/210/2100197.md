#### <span id="iv.iv.iii.xv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIV.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xv-p1"></span>That the Son of God is not a created
being is proved by the following arguments: (1) That He commanded not
that the Gospel should be preached to Himself; (2) that a created being
is given over unto vanity; (3) that the Son has created all things; (4)
that we read of Him as begotten; and (5) that the difference of
generation and adoption has always been understood in those places where
both natures—the divine and the human—are declared to co-exist in Him.
All of which testimony is confirmed by the Apostle’s interpretation.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xv-p2"></span>86. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.iii.xv-p2.1"></span>It</span> is now made plain, as I believe,
your sacred Majesty, that the Lord Jesus is neither unlike the Father,
nor one that began to exist in course of time. We have yet to confute
another blasphemy, and to show that the Son of God is not a created
being. Herein is the quickening <span
id="fr_1827"></span>[1828](#fn_1827) word that we read as our help, for
we have heard the <span id="page_216">p. 216</span> <span
id="iv.iv.iii.xv-Page_216"></span>passage read where the Lord saith: “Go
ye into all the world, and preach the Gospel to all creation.” <span
id="fr_1828"></span>[1829](#fn_1828) He Who saith “all creation” excepts
nothing. How, then, do they stand who call Christ a “creature”? If He
were a creature, could He have commanded that the Gospel should be
preached to Himself? It is not, therefore, a creature, but the Creator,
Who commits to His disciples the work of teaching created beings.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xv-p5"></span>87. Christ, then, is no created being;
for “created beings are,” as the Apostle hath said, “given over to
vanity.” <span id="fr_1829"></span>[1830](#fn_1829) Is Christ given over
unto vanity? Again, “creation”—according to the same Apostle—“groans and
travails together even until now.” What, then? Doth Christ take any part
in this groaning and travailing—He Who hath set us miserable mourners
free from death? “Creation,” saith the Apostle, “shall be set free from
the slavery of corruption.” <span id="fr_1830"></span>[1831](#fn_1830)
We see, then, that between creation and its Lord there is a vast
difference, for creation is enslaved, but “the Lord is the Spirit, and
where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.” <span
id="fr_1831"></span>[1832](#fn_1831)

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xv-p9"></span>88. Who was it that led first into
this error, of declaring Him Who created and made all things to be a
creature? Did the Lord, I would ask, create Himself? We read that “all
things were made by Him, and without Him was nothing made.” <span
id="fr_1832"></span>[1833](#fn_1832) This being so, did He make Himself?
We read—and who shall deny?—that in wisdom hath God made all
things. <span id="fr_1833"></span>[1834](#fn_1833) If so, how can we
suppose that wisdom was made in itself?

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xv-p12"></span>89. We read that the Son is begotten,
inasmuch as the Father saith: “I brought thee forth from the womb before
the morning star.” <span id="fr_1834"></span>[1835](#fn_1834) We read of
the “first-born” Son, <span id="fr_1835"></span>[1836](#fn_1835) of the
“only-begotten” <span id="fr_1836"></span>[1837](#fn_1836) —first-born,
because there is none before Him; only-begotten, because there is none
after Him. Again, we read: “Who shall declare His generation?” <span
id="fr_1837"></span>[1838](#fn_1837) “Generation,” mark you, not
“creation.” What argument can be brought to meet testimonies so great
and mighty as these?

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xv-p17"></span>90. Moreover, God’s Son discovers the
difference between generation and grace when He says: “I go up to My
Father and your Father, to My God and your God.” <span
id="fr_1838"></span>[1839](#fn_1838) He did not say, “I go up to our
Father,” but “I go up to My Father and your Father.” This distinction is
the sign of a difference, inasmuch as He Who is Christ’s Father is our
Creator.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xv-p19"></span>91. Furthermore He said, “to My God
and your God,” because although He and the Father are One, and the
Father is His Father by possession of the same nature, whilst God began
to be our Father through the office of the Son, not by virtue of nature,
but of grace—still He seems to point us here to the existence in Christ
of both natures, Godhead and Manhood,—Godhead of His Father, Manhood of
His Mother, the former being before all things, the latter derived from
the Virgin. For the first, speaking as the Son, He called God His
Father, and afterward, speaking as man, named Him as God.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xv-p20"></span>92. Everywhere, indeed, we have
witness in the Scriptures to show that Christ, in naming God as His God,
does so as man. “My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?” <span
id="fr_1839"></span>[1840](#fn_1839) And again: “From My mother’s womb
Thou art My God.” <span id="fr_1840"></span>[1841](#fn_1840) In the
former place He suffers as a man; in the latter it is a man who is
brought forth from his mother’s womb. And so when He says, “From My
mother’s womb Thou art My God,” He means that He Who was always His
Father is His God from the moment when He was brought forth from His
Mother’s womb.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xv-p23"></span>93. Seeing, then, that we read in the
Gospel, in the Apostle, in the Prophets, of Christ as begotten, how dare
the Arians to say that He was created or made? But, indeed, they ought
to have bethought them, where they have read of Him as created, where as
made. For it has been plainly shown that the Son of God is begotten of
God, born of God—let them, then, consider with care where they have read
that He was made, seeing that He was not made God, but born as God, the
Son of God; afterward, however, He was, according to the flesh, made man
of Mary.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xv-p24"></span>94. “But when the fulness of time was
come, God sent His Son, *made* of a woman, made under the Law.” <span
id="fr_1841"></span>[1842](#fn_1841) “*His* Son,” observe, not as one of
many, not as His in common with another, but His own, and in saying “His
Son,” the Apostle showed that it is of the Son’s nature that His
generation is eternal. Him the Apostle has affirmed to have been
afterwards “made” of a woman, in order that the making might be
understood not of the Godhead, but of the putting <span id="page_217">p.
217</span> <span id="iv.iv.iii.xv-Page_217"></span>on of a body—“made of
a woman,” then, by taking on of flesh; “made under the Law” through
observance of the Law. Howbeit, the former, the spiritual generation is
before the Law was, the latter is after the Law.

id="iv.iv.iii.xv-p26.1"></span>, cited in § 94.—St. Ambrose has *factum*
where St. Paul originally wrote <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iv.iii.xv-p26.2"></span>γενόμενον</span>, rendered “born” in the
A.V. St. Paul designedly, perhaps, wrote <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iv.iii.xv-p26.3"></span>γενόμενον</span>, not <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.iv.iii.xv-p26.4"></span>γεννηθέντα</span>,
the more usual word for “born.” For <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iv.iii.xv-p26.5"></span>γίγνεσθαι</span> is used to denote other
modes of beginning to exist, besides that in which animals are brought
into life; it is used of inanimate, as well as animate existence—*e.g.,*
[Mark iv. 37](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#037)<span
id="iv.iv.iii.xv-p26.6"></span>: “There ariseth (<span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.iv.iii.xv-p26.7"></span>γίνεται</span>) a
great storm of wind;” and thus we get the impersonal <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.iv.iii.xv-p26.8"></span>εγένετο</span>, “it
came to pass,” simply signifying an order of events. The import, then,
of the words *factum ex muliere,* <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iv.iii.xv-p26.9"></span>γενόμενον ἐκ γνναικός</span>, is that
Christ, in being born in human form, “in the likeness of men,” subjected
Himself to the limits of human existence, “came into being,” that is, in
the sensual world. This was his self-emptying ([Phil. ii.
7](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#007)<span
id="iv.iv.iii.xv-p26.10"></span>). Jesus, the man, the human person was
made—“made man” (Nicene Creed)—was made “man of the substance of His
mother” (Athanas. Creed); but by this “making,” St. Ambrose points out,
we must understand no more than the taking on of fleshly form. The Son,
on the other hand, Who is God, never began to exist, as He will never
cease; and even if He had not existed from eternity, He must have been
pre-existent, in order to assume a fleshly form so that, in any case,
birth of the Virgin does not affect His pre-existence as Son of God,
whilst to say that He was ever “made” is to confound that birth with the
Son’s generation of the Father, eternity with time, the divine with the
human order, the self-existent with the created.
