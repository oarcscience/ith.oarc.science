<span id="iv.iv.vii.iv"></span>

#### <span id="iv.iv.vii.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.iv-p1"></span>To the objection of the Arians, that
two Gods are introduced by a unity of substance, the answer is that a
plurality of Gods is more likely to be inferred from diversity of
substance. Further, their charge recoils upon themselves. Manifold
diversity is the reason why two men cannot be said to be one man, though
all men are called individually man, where a unity of nature is referred
to. There is one nature alone in them, but there is wholly a unity in
the Divine Persons. Therefore the Son is not to be severed from the
Father, especially as they dare not deny that worship is due to Him.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.iv-p2"></span>39. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.vii.iv-p2.1"></span>But</span> the Arians maintain the
following: If you say that, as the Father is the only true God, so also
is the Son, and confess that the Father and the Son are both of one
substance, you introduce not one God, but two. For they who are of one
substance seem not to be one God but two Gods. Just as two men or two
sheep or more are spoken of, but a man and a sheep are not spoken of as
two men or two sheep, but as one man and one sheep.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.iv-p3"></span>40. This is what the Arians say; and
by this cunning argument they attempt to catch the more simple-minded.
However if we read the divine Scriptures we shall find that plurality
occurs rather amongst those things which are of a diverse and different
substance, that is, <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iv.vii.iv-p3.1"></span>ἑτερούσια</span>. We have this set forth
in the books of Solomon, in that passage in which he said: “There are
three things impossible to understand, yea, a fourth which I know not,
the track of an eagle in the air, the way of a serpent upon a rock, the
path of a ship in the sea, and the way of a man in his youth.” <span
id="fr_2563"></span>[2564](#fn_2563.md) An eagle and a ship and a serpent
are not of one family and nature, but of a distinguishable and different
substance, and yet they are three. On the testimony of Scripture,
therefore, they learn that their arguments are against themselves.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.iv-p5"></span>41. Therefore, in saying that the
substance of the Father and of the Son is diverse and their Godhead
distinguishable, they themselves assert there are two Gods. <span
id="page_290">p. 290</span> <span id="iv.iv.vii.iv-Page_290"></span>But
we, when we confess the Father and the Son, in declaring them still to
be of one Godhead, say that there are not two Gods, but one God. And
this we establish by the word of the Lord. For where there are several,
there is a difference either of nature or of will and work. Lastly, that
they may be refuted on their own witness, two men are mentioned: But
though they are of one nature by right of birth, yet in time and thought
and work and place, they are apart; and so one man cannot be spoken of
under the signification and number of two; for there is no unity where
there is diversity. But God is said to be one, and the glory and
completeness of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit is thus
expressed.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.iv-p6"></span>42. Such, indeed, is the truth of
unity that, when the nature alone of human birth or of human flesh is
indicated, one man is the term used for the many, as it is written: “The
Lord is my helper, I will not fear what man can do unto me;” <span
id="fr_2564"></span>[2565](#fn_2564.md) that is, not the one person of a
man, but the one flesh, the one frailty of human birth. It added also:
“It is better to trust in the Lord than to trust in man.” <span
id="fr_2565"></span>[2566](#fn_2565.md) Here, too, it did not denote one
particular man, but a universal condition. Then, immediately after it
added, speaking of many: “It is better to put confidence in the Lord
than to put confidence in princes.” <span
id="fr_2566"></span>[2567](#fn_2566.md) Where man is spoken of, as we have
already said, there the common unity of the nature, which exists between
all is indicated; but where the princes are mentioned, there is a
certain distinction between their different powers.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.iv-p10"></span>43. Amongst men, or in men, there
exists a unity in some one thing, either in love, or desire, or flesh,
or devotion, or faith. But a universal unity, that embraces within
itself all things agreeably to the divine glory, is the property of the
Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit alone.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.iv-p11"></span>44. Wherefore the Lord also, in
pointing out the diversity that exists among men, who have nothing in
common that can tend towards the unity of an indivisible substance,
says: “In your law it is written that the testimony of two men is
true.” <span id="fr_2567"></span>[2568](#fn_2567.md) But though He had
said, “The testimony of two men is true,” when He came to the testimony
of Himself and His Father, He said not: “Our testimony is true, for it
is the testimony of two Gods;” but: “I am One that bear witness of
Myself, and the Father that sent Me beareth witness of Me.” <span
id="fr_2568"></span>[2569](#fn_2568.md) Earlier He also says: “If I judge,
My judgment is true; for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent
Me.” <span id="fr_2569"></span>[2570](#fn_2569.md) Thus, both in one place
and the other, He indicated both the Father and the Son, but neither
implied the plurality, nor severed the unity of their divine Substance.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.iv-p15"></span>45. It is plain, then, that
whatsoever is of one substance cannot be severed, even though it be not
single, but one. By singleness I mean that which the Greeks call <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.iv.vii.iv-p15.1"></span>μονοτής</span>.
Singleness has to do with a person; unity with a nature. That those
things which are of a different substance are wont to be called, not one
alone, but many, though already proved on the testimony of the prophet,
the Apostle himself has stated in so many words, saying: “For though
there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth.” <span
id="fr_2570"></span>[2571](#fn_2570.md) Dost thou see, then, that those who
are of different substances, and not of the verity of one nature, are
called “gods”? But the Father and the Son, being of one substance, are
not two Gods, but “One God, the Father, of Whom are all things, and one
Lord Jesus Christ, through Whom are all things.” <span
id="fr_2571"></span>[2572](#fn_2571.md) “One God,” he says, “and one Lord
Jesus;” and above: “One God, not two Gods;” and then: “One Lord, not two
Lords.” <span id="fr_2572"></span>[2573](#fn_2572.md)

<span id="iv.iv.vii.iv-p19"></span>46. Plurality, therefore, is
excluded, but the unity is not destroyed. But as, on the one hand, when
we read of the Lord Jesus, we do not dissociate the Father, as I have
already said, from the prerogative of ruling, because He has that in
common with the Son; so, on the other hand, when we read of the only
true God, the Father, we cannot sever the Son from the prerogative of
the only true God, for He has that in common with the Father.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.iv-p20"></span>47. Let them say what they feel or
what they think, when we read: “Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and
Him only shalt thou serve.” <span id="fr_2573"></span>[2574](#fn_2573.md)
Do they think Christ should not be worshipped, and that He ought not to
be served? But if that woman of Canaan who worshipped Him, <span
id="fr_2574"></span>[2575](#fn_2574.md) merited to gain what she asked for,
and the Apostle Paul, who confessed himself to be the servant of Christ
in the very outset of his letters, merited to be an Apostle “not of men,
neither by man, but by Jesus Christ;” <span
id="fr_2575"></span>[2576](#fn_2575.md) let them say what they think should
follow. Would they prefer to join with Arius in a league of treachery,
and so show, by denying Christ to be the only true God, that <span
id="page_291">p. 291</span> <span id="iv.iv.vii.iv-Page_291"></span>they
consider He should neither be worshipped nor served? Or would they
sooner go in company with Paul, who in serving and worshipping Christ
did not disown in word and heart the only true God, Whom he acknowledged
with dutiful service?

[Next: Chapter IV. It is objected by heretics that Christ offered
worship to His Father. But instead it is shown that this must be
referred to His humanity, as is clear from an examination of the
passage. However, it also offers fresh witness to His Godhead, as we
often see it happening in other actions that Christ did.](2100258.md)
