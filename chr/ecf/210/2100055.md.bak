#### <span id="iv.i.ii.xliii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XLIII.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xliii-p1"></span>On temperance and its chief parts,
especially tranquillity of mind and moderation, care for what is
virtuous, and reflection on what is seemly.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xliii-p2"></span>219. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.i.ii.xliii-p2.1"></span>As</span> we have spoken of three of the
virtues, there remains but the fourth for us to speak of. <span
id="fr_312"></span>[313](#fn_312.md) This is called temperance and <span
id="page_36">p. 36</span> <span
id="iv.i.ii.xliii-Page_36"></span>moderation; wherein, before all else,
tranquillity of mind, the attainment of gentleness, the grace of
moderation, regard for what is virtuous, and reflection on what is
seemly are sought and looked for.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xliii-p4"></span>220. We must keep to a certain order
in life, so that a foundation may be laid with our first feelings of
modesty, for that is the friend and ally of calmness of mind. Avoiding
over-confidence, averse to all excess, it loves sobriety, guards what is
honourable, and seeks only what is seemly.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xliii-p5"></span>221. Let choice of intercourse come
next. Let us link ourselves with older men of approved goodness. For as
the companionship of people of our own age is the pleasanter, so that of
our elders is the safer. By their guidance and the conduct of their
lives they give colour to the character of younger men, and tinge them
as it were with the deep purple of probity. For if they who are ignorant
of a locality are very glad to take a journey in the company of skilled
guides, how much more ought young men to enter on the path of life,
which is new to them, in the company of old men; so that they may not go
wrong, and turn aside from the true path of virtue. For nothing is
better than to have the same men both to direct us in life, and also to
be witnesses of how we live.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xliii-p6"></span>222. One must also in every action
consider what is suitable for different persons, times, and ages, and
what will also be in accordance with the abilities of individuals. For
often what befits one does not befit another; one thing suits a youth,
another an old man; one thing does in danger, another in good fortune.

<span id="iv.i.ii.xliii-p7"></span>223. David danced before the ark of
the Lord. <span id="fr_313"></span>[314](#fn_313.md) Samuel did not dance;
yet David was not blamed, while the other was praised. David changed his
countenance before the king, whose name was Achish. <span
id="fr_314"></span>[315](#fn_314.md) If he had done this without any fear
of being recognized, he would certainly not have escaped the charge of
levity. Saul also, surrounded by the company of prophets, himself
prophesied. Yet of him alone, as though he were unworthy, was it said:
“Is Saul also among the prophets?” <span
