<span id="iv.v.viii"></span>

### <span id="iv.v.viii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VII.

<span id="iv.v.viii-p1"></span>The washing away of sins is indicated by
the white robes of the catechumens, whence the Church speaks of herself
as black and comely. Angels marvel at her brightness as at that of the
flesh of the Lord. Moreover, Christ Himself commended His beauty to His
Spouse under many figures. The mutual affection of the one for the other
is described.

<span id="iv.v.viii-p2"></span>34. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.viii-p2.1"></span>After</span> this white robes were given to
you as a sign that you were putting off the covering of sins, and
putting on the chaste veil of innocence, of which the prophet said:
“Thou shalt sprinkle me with hyssop and I shall be cleansed, Thou shalt
wash me and I shall be made whiter than snow.” <span
id="fr_2868"></span>[2869](#fn_2868.md) For he who is baptized is seen to
be purified both according to the Law and according to the Gospel:
according to the Law, because Moses sprinkled the blood of the lamb with
a bunch of hyssop; <span id="fr_2869"></span>[2870](#fn_2869.md) according
to the Gospel, because Christ’s garments were white as snow, when in the
Gospel He showed forth the glory of His Resurrection. He, then, whose
guilt is remitted is made whiter than snow. So that God said by Isaiah:
“Though your sins be as scarlet, I will make them white as snow.” <span
id="fr_2870"></span>[2871](#fn_2870.md)

<span id="iv.v.viii-p6"></span>35. The Church, having put on these
garments through the laver of regeneration, says in the Song of Songs:
“I am black <span id="page_322">p. 322</span> <span
id="iv.v.viii-Page_322"></span>and comely, O daughters of
Jerusalem.” <span id="fr_2871"></span>[2872](#fn_2871.md) Black through the
frailty of her human condition, comely through the sacrament of faith.
And the daughters of Jerusalem beholding these garments say in
amazement: “Who is this that cometh up made white?” <span
id="fr_2872"></span>[2873](#fn_2872.md) She was black, how is she now
suddenly made white?

<span id="iv.v.viii-p9"></span>36. The angels, too, were in doubt when
Christ arose; the powers of heaven were in doubt when they saw that
flesh was ascending into heaven. Then they said: “Who is this King of
glory?” And whilst some said “Lift up your gates, O princes, and be ye
lift up, ye everlasting doors, and the King of glory shall come
in.” <span id="fr_2873"></span>[2874](#fn_2873.md) In Isaiah, too, we find
that the powers of heaven doubted and said: “Who is this that cometh up
from Edom, the redness of His garments is from Bosor, He who is glorious
in white apparel?” <span id="fr_2874"></span>[2875](#fn_2874.md)

<span id="iv.v.viii-p12"></span>37. But Christ, beholding His Church,
for whom He Himself, as you find in the book of the prophet Zechariah,
had put on filthy garments, now clothed in white raiment, seeing, that
is, a soul pure and washed in the laver of regeneration, says: “Behold,
thou art fair, My love, behold thou art fair, thy eyes are like a
dove’s,” <span id="fr_2875"></span>[2876](#fn_2875.md) in the likeness of
which the Holy Spirit descended from heaven. The eyes are beautiful like
those of a dove, because in the likeness of a dove the Holy Spirit
descended from heaven.

<span id="iv.v.viii-p14"></span>38. And farther on: “Thy teeth are like
a flock of sheep that are shorn, which are come up from the pool, which
all bear twins, and none is barren among them, thy lips are as a cord of
scarlet.” <span id="fr_2876"></span>[2877](#fn_2876.md) This is no slight
praise. First by the pleasing comparison to those that are shorn; for we
know that goats both feed in high places without risk, and securely find
their food in rugged places, and then when shorn are freed from what is
superfluous. The Church is likened to a flock of these, having in itself
the many virtues of those souls which through the laver lay aside the
superfluity of sins, and offer to Christ the mystic faith and the grace
of good living, which speak of the cross of the Lord Jesus.

<span id="iv.v.viii-p16"></span>39. The Church is beautiful in them. So
that God the Word says to her: “Thou art all fair, My love, and there is
no blemish in thee,” for guilt has been washed away. “Come hither from
Lebanon, My spouse, come hither from Lebanon, from the beginning of
faith wilt thou pass through and pass on,” <span
id="fr_2877"></span>[2878](#fn_2877.md) because, renouncing the world, she
passed through things temporal and passed on to Christ. And again, God
the Word says to her: “How beautiful and sweet art thou made, O love, in
thy delights! Thy stature is become like that of a palm-tree, and thy
breasts like bunches of grapes.” <span
id="fr_2878"></span>[2879](#fn_2878.md)

<span id="iv.v.viii-p19"></span>40. And the Church answers Him, “Who
will give Thee to me, my Brother, that didst suck the breasts of my
mother? If I find Thee without, I will kiss Thee, and indeed they will
not despise me. I will take Thee, and bring Thee into the house of my
mother; and into the secret chamber of her that conceived me. Thou shalt
teach me.” <span id="fr_2879"></span>[2880](#fn_2879.md) You see how,
delighted with the gifts of grace, she longs to attain to the innermost
mysteries, and to consecrate all her affections to Christ. She still
seeks, she still stirs up His love, and asks of the daughters of
Jerusalem to stir it up for her, and desires that by their beauty, which
is that of faithful souls, her spouse may be incited to ever richer love
for her.

<span id="iv.v.viii-p21"></span>41. So that the Lord Jesus Himself,
invited by such eager love and by the beauty of comeliness and grace,
since now no offences pollute the baptized, says to the Church: “Place
Me as a seal upon thy heart, as a signet upon thine arm;” <span
id="fr_2880"></span>[2881](#fn_2880.md) that is, thou art comely, My
beloved, thou art all fair, nothing is wanting to thee. Place Me as a
seal upon thine heart, that thy faith may shine forth in the fulness of
the sacrament. Let thy works also shine and set forth the image of God
in the Whose image thou wast made. Let no persecution lessen thy love,
which many waters cannot quench, nor many rivers drown.

<span id="iv.v.viii-p23"></span>42. And then remember that you received
the seal of the Spirit; the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the
spirit of counsel and strength, the spirit of knowledge and godliness,
and the spirit of holy fear, <span id="fr_2881"></span>[2882](#fn_2881.md)
and preserved what you received. God the Father sealed you, Christ the
Lord strengthened you, and gave the earnest of the Spirit in your
heart, <span id="fr_2882"></span>[2883](#fn_2882.md) as you have learned in
the lesson from the Apostle. <span id="fr_2883"></span>[2884](#fn_2883.md)

confirmation, and to the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit received
therein. In the Early Church as in the Eastern Church to the present
day, confirmation was administered immediately after baptism.

[Next: Chapter VIII. Of the mystical feast of the altar of the Lord.
Lest any should think lightly of it, St. Ambrose shows that it is of
higher antiquity than the sacred rites of the Jews, since it was
foreshadowed in the sacrifice of Melchisedech, and far better than the
manna, as being the Body of Christ.](2100283.md)
