### <span id="iv.v.x-p0.1"></span>Chapter IX.

<span id="iv.v.x-p1"></span>In order that no one through observing the
outward part should waver in faith, many instances are brought forward
wherein the outward nature has been changed, and so it is proved that
bread is made the true body of Christ. The treatise then is brought to a
termination with certain remarks as to the effects of the sacrament, the
disposition of the recipients, and such like.

<span id="iv.v.x-p2"></span>50. P<span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.x-p2.1"></span>erhaps</span> you will say, “I see something
else, how is it that you assert that I receive the Body of Christ?” And
this is the point which remains for us to prove. And what evidence shall
we make use of? Let us prove that this is not what nature made, but what
the blessing consecrated, and the power of blessing is greater than that
of nature, because by blessing nature itself is changed.

<span id="iv.v.x-p3"></span>51. Moses was holding a rod, he cast it down
and it became a serpent. <span id="fr_2890"></span>[2891](#fn_2890.md)
Again, he took hold of the tail of the serpent and it returned to the
nature of a rod. You see that by virtue of the prophetic office there
were two changes, of the nature both of the serpent and of the rod. The
streams of Egypt were running with a pure flow of water; of a sudden
from the veins of the sources blood began to burst forth, and none could
drink of the river. Again, at the prophet’s prayer the blood ceased, and
the nature of water returned. <span id="fr_2891"></span>[2892](#fn_2891.md)
The people of the Hebrews were shut in on every side, hemmed in on the
one hand by the Egyptians, on the other by the sea; Moses lifted up his
rod, the water divided and hardened like walls, and a way for the feet
appeared between the waves. <span id="fr_2892"></span>[2893](#fn_2892.md)
Jordan being turned back, returned, contrary to nature, to the source of
its stream. <span id="fr_2893"></span>[2894](#fn_2893.md) Is it not clear
that the nature of the waves of the sea and of the river stream was
changed? The people of the fathers thirsted, Moses touched the rock, and
water flowed out of the rock. <span id="fr_2894"></span>[2895](#fn_2894.md)
Did not grace work a result contrary to nature, so that the rock poured
forth water, which by nature it did not contain? Marah was a most bitter
stream, so that the thirsting people could not drink. Moses cast wood
into the water, and the water lost its bitterness, which grace of a
sudden tempered. <span id="fr_2895"></span>[2896](#fn_2895.md) In the time
of Elisha the prophet one of the sons of the prophets lost the head from
his axe, which sank. He who had lost the iron asked Elisha, who cast in
a piece of wood and the iron swam. This, too, we clearly recognize as
having happened contrary to nature, for iron is of heavier nature than
water.

<span id="iv.v.x-p10"></span>52. We observe, then, that grace has more
power than nature, and yet so far we have only spoken of the grace of a
prophet’s blessing. But if the blessing of man had such power as to
change nature, what are we to say of that divine consecration where the
very words of the Lord and Saviour operate? For that sacrament which you
receive is made what it is by the word of Christ. But if the word of
Elijah had such power as to bring down fire from heaven, shall not the
word of Christ have power to change the nature of the elements? You read
concerning the making of the whole world: “He spake and they were made,
He commanded and they were created.” <span
id="fr_2896"></span>[2897](#fn_2896.md) Shall not the word of Christ, which
was able to make out of nothing that which was not, be able to change
things which already are into what they were not? For it is not less to
give a new nature to things than to change them.

<span id="iv.v.x-p12"></span>53. But why make use of arguments? Let us
use the examples He gives, and by the example of the Incarnation prove
the truth of the mystery. Did the course of nature proceed as usual when
the Lord Jesus was born of Mary? If we look to the usual course, a woman
ordinarily conceives after connection with a man. And this body which we
make is that which was born of the Virgin. Why do you seek the order of
nature in the Body of Christ, seeing that the Lord Jesus Himself was
born of a Virgin, not according to nature? It is the true Flesh of
Christ which crucified and buried, this is then truly the Sacrament of
His Body.

<span id="iv.v.x-p13"></span>54. The Lord Jesus Himself proclaims: “This
is My Body.” <span id="fr_2897"></span>[2898](#fn_2897.md) Before the
blessing of the heavenly words another nature is spoken of, after the
consecration the Body is signified. He Himself speaks of His Blood.
Before the consecration it has another name, <span id="page_325">p.
325</span> <span id="iv.v.x-Page_325"></span>after it is called Blood.
And you say, Amen, that is, It is true. Let the heart within confess
what the mouth utters, let the soul feel what the voice speaks.

<span id="iv.v.x-p15"></span>55. Christ, then, feeds His Church with
these sacraments, by means of which the substance of the soul is
strengthened, and seeing the continual progress of her grace, He rightly
says to her: “How comely are thy breasts, my sister, my spouse, how
comely they are made by wine, and the smell of thy garments is above all
spices. A dropping honeycomb are thy lips, my spouse, honey and milk are
under thy tongue, and the smell of thy garments is as the smell of
Lebanon. A garden enclosed is my sister, my spouse, a garden enclosed, a
fountain sealed.” <span id="fr_2898"></span>[2899](#fn_2898.md) By which He
signifies that the mystery ought to remain sealed up with you, that it
be not violated by the deeds of an evil life, and pollution of chastity,
that it be not made known to thou, for whom it is not fitting, nor by
garrulous talkativeness it be spread abroad amongst unbelievers. Your
guardianship of the faith ought therefore to be good, that integrity of
life and silence may endure unblemished.

<span id="iv.v.x-p17"></span>56. For which reason, too, the Church,
guarding the depth of the heavenly mysteries, repels the furious storms
of wind, and calls to her the sweetness of the grace of spring, and
knowing that her garden cannot displease Christ, invites the Bridegroom,
saying: “Arise, O north wind, and come, thou south; blow upon my garden,
and let my ointments flow down. Let my Brother come down to His garden,
and eat the fruit of His trees.” <span
id="fr_2899"></span>[2900](#fn_2899.md) For it has good trees and fruitful,
which have dipped their roots in the water of the sacred spring, and
with fresh growth have shot forth into good fruits, so as now not to be
cut with the axe of the prophet, but to abound with the fruitfulness of
the Gospel.

<span id="iv.v.x-p19"></span>57. Lastly, the Lord also, delighted with
their fertility, answers: “I have entered into My garden, My sister, My
spouse; I have gathered My myrrh with My spices, I have eaten My meat
with My honey, I have drunk My drink with My milk.” <span
id="fr_2900"></span>[2901](#fn_2900.md) Understand, you faithful, why He
spoke of meat and drink. And there is no doubt that He Himself eats and
drinks in us, as you have read that He says that in our persons He is in
prison. <span id="fr_2901"></span>[2902](#fn_2901.md)

<span id="iv.v.x-p22"></span>58. Wherefore, too, the Church, beholding
so great grace, exhorts her sons and her friends to come together to the
sacraments, saying: “Eat, my friends, and drink and be inebriated, my
brother.” <span id="fr_2902"></span>[2903](#fn_2902.md) What we eat and
what we drink the Holy Spirit has elsewhere made plain by the prophet,
saying, “Taste and see that the Lord is good, blessed is the man that
hopeth in Him.” <span id="fr_2903"></span>[2904](#fn_2903.md) In that
sacrament is Christ, because it is the Body of Christ, it is therefore
not bodily food but spiritual. Whence the Apostle says of its type: “Our
fathers ate spiritual food and drank spiritual drink,” <span
id="fr_2904"></span>[2905](#fn_2904.md) for the Body of God is a spiritual
body; the Body of Christ is the Body of the Divine Spirit, for the
Spirit is Christ, as we read: “The Spirit before our face is Christ the
Lord.” <span id="fr_2905"></span>[2906](#fn_2905.md) And in the Epistle of
Peter we read: “Christ died for us.” <span
id="fr_2906"></span>[2907](#fn_2906.md) Lastly, that food strengthens our
heart, and that drink “maketh glad the heart of man,” <span
id="fr_2907"></span>[2908](#fn_2907.md) as the prophet has recorded.

<span id="iv.v.x-p29"></span>59. So, then, having obtained everything,
let us know that we are born again, but let us not say, How are we born
again? Have we entered a second time into our mother’s womb and been
born again? I do not recognize here the course of nature. But here there
is no order of nature, where is the excellence of grace. And again, it
is not always the course of nature which brings about conception, for we
confess that Christ the Lord was conceived of a Virgin, and reject the
order of nature. For Mary conceived not of man, but was with child of
the Holy Spirit, as Matthew says: “She was found with child of the Holy
Spirit.” <span id="fr_2908"></span>[2909](#fn_2908.md) If, then, the Holy
Spirit coming down upon the Virgin wrought the conception, and effected
the work of generation, surely we must not doubt but that, coming down
upon the Font, or upon those who receive Baptism, He effects the reality
of the new birth.
