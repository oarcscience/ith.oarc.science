<span id="iv.vii.iv.v"></span>

#### <span id="iv.vii.iv.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.

<span id="iv.vii.iv.v-p1"></span>St. Ambrose, speaking of tears,
explains David’s saying, “Every night wash l my couch with my tears,”
and goes on to speak of Christ bearing our griefs and infirmities.
Everything should be referred to His honour, and we ought to rejoice
with spiritual joy, but not after a worldly fashion.

<span id="iv.vii.iv.v-p2"></span>21. <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vii.iv.v-p2.1"></span>And</span> who can now fail to understand
that the holy prophet said for our instruction: “Every night will I wash
my couch and water my bed with my tears”? <span
id="fr_3283"></span>[3284](#fn_3283.md) For if you take it literally for
his bed, he shows that such abundance of tears should be shed as to wash
the bed and water it with tears, the couch of him who is praying, for
weeping has to do with the present, rewards with the future, since it is
said: “Blessed are ye that weep, for ye shall laugh;” <span
id="fr_3284"></span>[3285](#fn_3284.md) or if we take the word of the
prophet as applied to our bodies, we must wash away the offences of the
body with tears of penitence. For Solomon made himself a bed of wood
from Lebanon, its pillars were of silver, its bottom of gold, its back
strewn with gems. <span id="fr_3285"></span>[3286](#fn_3285.md) What is
that bed but the fashion of our body? For by gems is set forth the
splendour of the brightness of the air, fire is set forth by the gold,
water by silver, and earth by wood, of which four elements the human
body consists, in which our soul rests, if it do not exist deprived of
rest by the roughness of hills or the damp ground, but raised on high,
above vices, supported by the wood. For which reason David also says:
“The Lord will send him help upon his bed of pain.” <span
id="fr_3286"></span>[3287](#fn_3286.md) For how can that be a bed of pain
which cannot feel pain, and which has no feeling? But the body of pain
is like the body of that death, of which it is said: “O wretched man
that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death?” <span
id="fr_3287"></span>[3288](#fn_3287.md)

<span id="iv.vii.iv.v-p8"></span>22. And since I have inserted a clause
in which mention is made of the Lord’s Body, lest any one should be
troubled at reading that the Lord took a body of pain, let him remember
that the Lord grieved and wept <span id="page_385">p. 385</span> <span
id="iv.vii.iv.v-Page_385"></span>over the death of Lazarus, <span
id="fr_3288"></span>[3289](#fn_3288.md) and was wounded in His passion, and
that from the wound there went forth blood and water, <span
id="fr_3289"></span>[3290](#fn_3289.md) and that He gave up His Spirit.
Water for washing, Blood for drink, the Spirit for His rising again. For
Christ alone is to us hope, faith, and love—hope in His resurrection,
faith in the laver, and love in the sacrament.

<span id="iv.vii.iv.v-p11"></span>23. And as He took a body of pain, so
too He turned His bed in His weakness, <span
id="fr_3290"></span>[3291](#fn_3290.md) for He converted it to the benefit
of human flesh. For by His Passion weakness was ended, and death by His
resurrection. And yet you ought to mourn for the world but to rejoice in
the Lord, to be sad for penitence but joyful for grace, though, too, the
teacher of the Gentiles by a wholesome precept has bidden to weep with
them that weep, and to rejoice with them that do rejoice. <span
id="fr_3291"></span>[3292](#fn_3291.md)

<span id="iv.vii.iv.v-p14"></span>24. But let him who desires to solve
the whole difficulty of this question have recourse to the same Apostle.
“Whatsoever ye do,” says he, “in word or deed, do all in the Name of our
Lord Jesus Christ, giving thanks to God the Father by Him.” <span
id="fr_3292"></span>[3293](#fn_3292.md) Let us then refer all our words and
deeds to Christ, Who brought life out of death, and created light out of
darkness. For as a sick body is at one time cherished by warmth, at
another soothed by cool applications, and the variation of remedies, if
carried out according to the direction of the physician, is healthful,
but if done in opposition to his orders increases the sickness; so
whatever is paid to Christ is a remedy, whatever is done by our own will
is harmful.

<span id="iv.vii.iv.v-p16"></span>25. There ought then to be the joy of
the mind, conscious of right, not excited by unrestrained feasts, or
nuptial concerts, for in such modesty is not safe, and temptation may be
suspected where excessive dancing accompanies festivities. I desire that
the virgins of God should be far from this. For as a certain teacher of
this world has said: “No one dances when sober unless he is mad.” <span
id="fr_3293"></span>[3294](#fn_3293.md) Now if, according to the wisdom of
this world, either drunkenness or madness is the cause of dancing, what
a warning is given to us amongst the instances mentioned in the Divine
Scriptures, where John, the forerunner of Christ, being beheaded at the
wish of a dancer, is an instance that the allurements of dancing did
more harm than the madness of sacrilegious anger.
