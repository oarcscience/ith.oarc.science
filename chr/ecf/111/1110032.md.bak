<span id="vi.xxvii-p1"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vi.xxvii-p1.1"></span>Homily XXVII.</span>

<span id="vi.xxvii-p2"></span>[Acts
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#018.md),
[19](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#019.md)<span id="vi.xxvii-p2.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xxvii-p3"></span>“Now as soon as it was day, there was no
small stir among the soldiers, what was become of Peter. And when Herod
had sought for him, and found him not, he examined the keepers, and
commanded that they should be put to death. And he went down from Judea
to Cæsarea, and there abode.”

<span id="vi.xxvii-p4"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="vi.xxvii-p4.1"></span>Some</span> persons, it is likely, are at a
loss how to explain it, that God should quietly look on while (His)
champions <span id="fr_638"></span>[639](#fn_638.md) are put to death, and
now again the soldiers on account of Peter: and yet it was possible for
Him after (delivering) Peter to rescue them also. But it was not yet the
time of judgment, so as to render to each according to his deserts. And
besides, it was not Peter that put them into his hands. For the thing
that most annoyed him was the being mocked; just as in the case of his
grandfather when he was deceived by the wise men, that was what made him
(feel) cut to the heart—the being (eluded and) made ridiculous. <span
id="fr_639"></span>[640](#fn_639.md) “And having put them to the question,”
it says, “he ordered them to be led away to execution.” ([Matt. ii.
16](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#016)<span id="vi.xxvii-p6.7"></span>..md)
And yet he had heard from them—for he had put them to the question—both
that the chains had been left, and that he had taken his sandals, and
that until that night he was with them. “Having put them to the
question:” but what did they conceal? <span
id="fr_640"></span>[641](#fn_640.md) Why then did they not themselves also
flee? “He ordered them to be led away to execution:” and yet he ought to
have marvelled, ought to have been astonished at this. The consequence
is, by the death of these men (the thing), is made manifest to all: both
his wickedness is exposed to view, and (it is made clear that) the
wonder (is) of God. “And he went down from Judea to Cæsarea, and there
abode: and Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon: but
they came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus the king’s
chamberlain their friend, desired peace; because their country was
nourished by the king’s country. And upon a set day Herod, arrayed in
royal apparel, sat upon his throne, and made an oration unto them. And
the people gave a shout, saying, ‘It is the voice of a god, and not of a
man,’ And immediately the angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave
not God the glory: and he was eaten of worms, and gave up the ghost.”
([Acts 12.20-23](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#020.md)<span
id="vi.xxvii-p7.1"></span>.) \* \* But see how (the writer) here does
not hide these things. <span id="fr_641"></span>[642](#fn_641.md) Why does
he mention this history? Say, what has it to do with the Gospel, that
Herod is incensed with the Tyrians and Sidonians? It is not a small
matter, even this, how immediately justice seized him; although not
because of Peter, but because of his arrogant speaking. And yet, it may
be said, if those shouted, what is that to him? Because he accepted the
acclamation, because he accounted himself to be worthy of the adoration.
Through him those most receive a lesson, who so thoughtlessly flattered
him (al. <span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxvii-p8.6"></span>οἱ
κολακεύοντες</span>). Observe again, while both parties deserve
punishment, this man is punished. For this is not the time of judgment,
but He punishes him that had most to answer for, leaving the others to
profit by this man’s fate. <span id="fr_642"></span>[643](#fn_642.md) “And
the word of God,” it says, “grew,” i.e. in consequence of this, “and
multiplied.” ([Acts 12.24](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#024.md)<span
id="vi.xxvii-p9.1"></span>.) Do you mark God’s providential management?
“But Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled
their ministry, and took with them John, whose surname was Mark.” ([Acts
12.25](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#025.md)<span
id="vi.xxvii-p9.2"></span>.) “Now there were in the Church that was at
Antioch, certain prophets and teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was
called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaën, which had been brought
up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.” <span
id="fr_643"></span>[644](#fn_643.md) ([Acts
13.1](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#001.md)<span
id="vi.xxvii-p10.4"></span>.) He still mentions Barnabas first: for Paul
was not yet famous, he had not yet wrought any sign. “As they ministered
to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said, Separate Me Barnabas and
Saul for the work whereunto I have called them. And when they had fasted
and prayed, and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.” ([Acts
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#002.md),
[3](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#003)<span id="vi.xxvii-p10.5"></span>..md)
What means, “Ministering?” Preaching. “Separate for Me,” it says,
“Barnabas and Saul.” What means, “Separate for Me?” For the work, for
the Apostleship. See again by what persons he is ordained (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxvii-p10.6"></span>γυμνοτέρα</span>. Cat.
<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxvii-p10.7"></span>σεμνοτέρα</span>,
“more awful.”) By Lucius the Cyrenean and Manaën, or rather, by the
Spirit. The less the persons, the more palpable the grace. He is
ordained henceforth to Apostleship, so as to preach with authority. How
then does he himself say, “Not from men, nor by man?” <span
id="fr_644"></span>[645](#fn_644.md) (<span
id="vi.xxvii-p11.4"></span>[Gal. i.
1](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#001)<span id="vi.xxvii-p11.5"></span>..md)
Because it was not man that called or brought him over: this is why he
says, “Not from men. Neither by man,” that is, that he was not sent by
this (man), but by the Spirit. Wherefore also (the writer) thus
proceeds: “So they, being sent forth by the Holy Ghost, departed unto
Seleucia; and from thence they sailed to Cyprus.” ([Acts
13.4](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#004.md)<span
id="vi.xxvii-p11.6"></span>.) But let us look over again what has been
said.

<span id="vi.xxvii-p12"></span>(Recapitulation.) “And when it was day,”
etc. ([Acts 12.18](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#018.md)<span
id="vi.xxvii-p12.1"></span>.) For <span
id="fr_645"></span>[646](#fn_645.md) if the Angel had brought out the
soldiers also, along with Peter, it would have been thought a case of
flight. Then why, you may ask, was it not otherwise managed? Why, where
is the harm? Now, if we see that they who have suffered unjustly, take
no harm, we shall not raise these questions. For why do you not say the
same of James? Why did not (God) rescue him? “There was no small stir
among the soldiers.” So (clearly) had they perceived nothing (of what
had happened). Lo, I take up the plea in their defence. The chains were
there, and the keepers within, and the prison shut, nowhere a wall
broken through, all told the same tale: the man had been carried
off: <span id="fr_646"></span>[647](#fn_646.md) why dost thou condemn them?
Had they wished to let him off, they would have done it before, or would
have gone out with him. “But he gave them money?” ([Acts
3.6](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#006)<span id="vi.xxvii-p14.3"></span>..md)
And how should he, who had not to give even to a poor man, have the
means to give to these? And then neither had the chains been broken, nor
were they loosed. He ought to have seen, that the thing was of God, and
no work of man. “And he went down from Judea to Cæsarea, and there
abode. And Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon,”
etc. ([Acts 12.19](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#019.md)<span
id="vi.xxvii-p14.4"></span>.) He is now going to mention (a matter of)
history: this is the reason why he adds the names, that it may be shown
how he keeps to the truth in all things. “And,” it says, “having made
Blastus the king’s chamberlain their friend, they desired peace; because
their country was nourished by the king’s country.” ([Acts
12:20](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#020.md),
[21](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#021)<span id="vi.xxvii-p14.5"></span>..md)
For probably there was a famine. “And on a set day,” etc. (Joseph.
*Ant.* xix.) Josephus also says this, that he fell into a lingering
disease. Now the generality were not aware of this, <span
id="fr_647"></span>[648](#fn_647.md) but the Apostle sets it down: yet at
the same time their ignorance was an advantage, in regard that they
imputed what befell (Agrippa) to his putting James and the soldiers to
death. Observe, when he slew the Apostle, he did nothing of this sort
but when (he slew) these; in fact he knew not what to say about
it: <span id="fr_648"></span>[649](#fn_648.md) as being at a loss, then,
and feeling ashamed, “he went down from Judea to Cæsarea.” I suppose it
was also to bring those (men of Tyre and Sidon) to apologize, that he
withdrew (from Jerusalem): for with those he was incensed, while paying
such court to these. See how vainglorious the man is: meaning to confer
the boon upon them, he makes an harangue. But Josephus says, that he was
also arrayed in a splendid robe made of silver. Observe both what
flatterers those were, and what a high spirit was shown by the Apostles:
the man whom the whole nation so courted, the same they held in
contempt. ([Acts 12.24](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#024.md)<span
id="vi.xxvii-p16.15"></span>.) But observe again a great refreshing
granted to them, and the numberless benefits accruing from the vengeance
inflicted upon him. But if this man, because it was said to him, “It is
the voice of God and not of a man ([Acts
12.22](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#022.md)<span
id="vi.xxvii-p16.16"></span>) although he said nothing himself, suffered
such things: much more should Christ, had He not Himself been God (have
suffered) for saying always as He did, “These words of mine are not
Mine” (<span id="vi.xxvii-p16.17"></span>[John xiv.
10](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#010.md)<span id="vi.xxvii-p16.18"></span>;
xviii. 36) and, “Angels minister to Me,” and such like. But that man
ended His life by a shameful and miserable death, and thenceforth no
more is seen of him. And observe him also, easily talked over even by
Blastus, like a poor creature, soon incensed and again pacified, and on
all occasions a slave of the populace, with nothing free and independent
about him. But mark also the authority of the Holy Ghost: “As they
ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said, Separate Me
Barnabas and Saul.” ([Acts 13.2](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#002.md)<span
id="vi.xxvii-p16.19"></span>.) What being would have dared, if not of
the same authority, to say this? “Separate,” etc. But this is done, that
they may not keep together among themselves. The Spirit saw that they
had greater power, and were able to be sufficient for many. And how did
He speak to them? Probably by prophets: therefore the writer premises,
that there were prophets also. And they were fasting and ministering:
that thou mayest learn that there was need of great sobriety. In Antioch
he is ordained, where he preaches. Why did He not say, Separate for the
Lord, but, “For me?” It shows that He is of one authority and power.
“And when they had fasted,” etc. Seest thou what a great thing fasting
is? “So they being sent forth by the Holy Ghost:” it shows that the
Spirit did all.

<span id="vi.xxvii-p17"></span>A great, yes a great good is fasting: it
is circumscribed by no limits. When need was to ordain, then they fast:
and to them while fasting, the Spirit spake. Thus much only do I enjoin:
(I say) not fast, but abstain from luxury. Let us seek meats to nourish,
not things to ruin us; seek meats for food, not occasions of diseases,
of diseases both of soul and body: seek food which hath comfort, not
luxury which is full of discomfort: the one is luxury, the other
mischief; the one is pleasure, the other pain; the one is agreeable to
nature, the other contrary to nature. For say, if one should give thee
hemlock juice to drink, would it not be against nature? if one should
give thee logs and stones, wouldest thou not reject them? Of course, for
they are against nature. Well, and so is luxury. For just as in a city,
under an invasion of enemies when there has been siege and tumult, great
is the uproar, so is it in the soul, under invasion of wine and luxury.
“Who hath woe? who hath tumults? who hath discomforts and babblings? Are
they not they that tarry long at the wine? Whose are bloodshot eyes?”
(<span id="vi.xxvii-p17.1"></span>[Prov.
23:29](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#029.md),
[30](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#030)<span id="vi.xxvii-p17.2"></span>..md)
But yet, say what we will, we shall not bring off those who give
themselves up to luxury, unless <span id="fr_649"></span>[650](#fn_649.md)
we bring into conflict therewith a different affection. And first, let
us address ourselves to the women. Nothing uglier than a woman given to
luxury, nothing uglier than a woman given to drink. The bloom of her
complexion is faded: the calm and mild expression of the eyes is
rendered turbid, as when a cloud intercepts the rays of the sunshine. It
is a vulgar, (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxvii-p18.7"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxvii-p18.8"></span>νελεύθερον</span>) slave-like, thoroughly
low-lived habit. How disgusting is a woman when from her breath you
catch sour whiffs of fetid wine: a woman belching, giving out a fume
(<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxvii-p18.9"></span>χυμὸν</span>) of
decomposing meats; herself weighed down, unable to keep upright; her
face flushed with an unnatural red; yawning incessantly, and everything
swimming in a mist before her eyes! But not such, she that abstains from
luxurious living: no (this abstinence makes her look) a more beautiful,
well-bred (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxvii-p18.10"></span>σωφρονεστέρα</span>) woman. For even to the
body, the composure of the soul imparts a beauty of its own. Do not
imagine that the impression of beauty results only from the bodily
features. Give me a handsome girl, but turbulent (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxvii-p18.11"></span>τεταραγμένην</span>),
loquacious, railing, given to drink, extravagant, (and tell me) if she
is not worse-looking than any ugly woman? But if she were bashful, if
she would hold her peace, if she learnt to blush, if to speak modestly
(<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxvii-p18.12"></span>συμμέτρως</span>), if to find time for
fastings; her beauty would be twice as great, her freshness would be
heightened, her look more engaging, fraught with modesty and good
breeding (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxvii-p18.13"></span>σωφροσύνης καὶ κοσμιότητος</span>). Now
then, shall we speak of men? What can be uglier than a man in drink? He
is an object of ridicule to his servants, of ridicule to his enemies, of
pity to his friends; deserving condemnation without end: a wild beast
rather than a human being; for to devour much food is proper to panther,
and lion, and bear. No wonder (that they do so), for those creatures
have not a reasonable soul. And yet even they, if they be gorged with
food more than they need, and beyond the measure appointed them by
nature, get their whole body ruined by it: how much more we? Therefore
hath God contracted our stomach into a small compass; therefore hath He
marked out a small measure of sustenance, that He may instruct us to
attend to the soul.

<span id="vi.xxvii-p19"></span>Let us consider our very make, and we
shall see there is in us but one little part that has this operation—for
our mouth and tongue are meant for singing hymns, our throat for
voice—therefore the very necessity of nature has tied us down, that we
may not, even involuntarily, get into much trouble (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxvii-p19.1"></span>πραγματείαν</span>) (in
this way). Since, if indeed luxurious living had not its pains, nor
sickness and infirmities, it might be tolerated: but as the case is, He
hath stinted thee by restrictions of nature, that even if thou wish to
exceed, thou mayest not be able to do so. Is not pleasure thine object,
beloved? This thou shalt find from moderation. Is not health? This too
thou shalt so gain. Is not easiness of mind? This too. Is not freedom?
is not vigor and good habit of body, is not sobriety and alertness of
mind? (All these thou shalt find); so entirely are all good things
there, while in the other are the contraries to these, discomfort,
distemper, disease, embarrassment—waste of substance (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxvii-p19.2"></span>ἀ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxvii-p19.3"></span>νελευθερία</span>). Then
how comes it, you will ask, that we all run eagerly after this? It comes
of disease. For say, what is it that makes the sick man hanker after the
thing that does him harm? Is not this very hankering a part of his
disease? Why is it that the lame man does not walk upright? This very
thing, does it come of his being lazy, and not choosing to go to the
physician? For there are some things, in which the pleasure they bring
with them is temporary, but lasting the punishment: others just the
contrary, in which the endurance is for a time, the pleasure perpetual.
He, therefore, that has so little solidity and strength of purpose as
not to slight present sweets for future, is soon overcome. Say, how came
Esau to be overcome? how came he to prefer the present pleasure to the
future honor? Through want of solidity and firmness of character. ([Gen.
xxv. 33](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#033.md)<span
id="vi.xxvii-p19.4"></span>.) And this fault itself, say you, whence
comes it? Of our ownselves: and it is plain from this consideration.
When we have the mind, we do rouse ourselves, and become capable of
endurance. Certain it is, if at any time necessity comes upon us, nay,
often only from a spirit of emulation, we get to see clearly what is
useful for us. When therefore thou art about to indulge in luxury,
consider how brief the pleasure, consider the loss—for loss it is indeed
to spend so much money to one’s own hurt—the diseases, the infirmities:
and despise luxury. How many shall I enumerate who have suffered evils
from indulgence? Noah was drunken, and was exposed in his nakedness, and
see what evils came of this. ([Gen. ix.
20](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#020)<span id="vi.xxvii-p19.5"></span>..md)
Esau through greediness abandoned his birthright, and was set upon
fratricide. The people of Israel “sat down to eat and to drink, and rose
up to play.” ([Ex. xxxii. 6](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#006.md)<span
id="vi.xxvii-p19.6"></span>.) Therefore saith the Scripture, “When thou
hast eaten and drunken, remember the Lord thy God.” ([Deut. vi.
12](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#012)<span id="vi.xxvii-p19.7"></span>..md)
For they fell over a precipice, in failing into luxury. “The widow,” he
saith, “that liveth in pleasure, is dead while she liveth” (<span
id="vi.xxvii-p19.8"></span>[1 Tim. v.
6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#006)<span id="vi.xxvii-p19.9"></span>.md):
and again, “The beloved waxed sleek, grew thick, and kicked” (<span
id="vi.xxvii-p19.10"></span>[Deut. xxxii.
15](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#015)<span id="vi.xxvii-p19.11"></span>.md):
and again the Apostle, “Make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the
lusts thereof.” (<span id="vi.xxvii-p19.12"></span>[Rom. xiii.
14](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#014)<span id="vi.xxvii-p19.13"></span>..md)
I am not enacting as a law that there shall be fasting, for indeed there
is no one who would listen; but I am doing away with daintiness, I am
cutting off luxury for the sake of your own profit: for like a winter
torrent, luxury overthrows all: there is nothing to stop its course: it
casts out from a kingdom: what is the gain of it (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxvii-p19.14"></span>τί τὸ πλέον</span>)?
Would you enjoy a (real) luxury? Give to the poor; invite Christ, so
that even after the table is removed, you may still have this luxury to
enjoy. For now, indeed, you have it not, and no wonder: but then you
will have it. Would you taste a (real) luxury? Nourish your soul, give
to her of that food to which she is used: do not kill her by
starvation.—It is the time for war, the time for contest: and do you sit
enjoying yourself? Do you not see even those who wield sceptres, how
they live frugally while abroad on their campaigns? “We wrestle not
against flesh and blood” ([Eph. vi.
12](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#012)<span id="vi.xxvii-p19.15"></span>.md);
and are you fattening yourself when about to wrestle? The adversary
stands grinding his teeth, and are you giving a loose to jollity, and
devoting yourself to the table? I know that I speak these things in
vain, yet not (in vain) for all. “He that hath ears to hear, let him
hear.” (<span id="vi.xxvii-p19.16"></span>[Luke viii.
8](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#008)<span id="vi.xxvii-p19.17"></span>..md)
Christ is pining through hunger, and are you frittering yourself away
(<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxvii-p19.18"></span>διασπᾅς</span>)
with gluttony? Two inconsistencies (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxvii-p19.19"></span>Δύο ἀμετρίαι</span>). For what evil does not
luxury cause? It is contrary to itself: so that I know not how it gets
its name: but just as that is called glory, which is (really) infamy,
and that riches, which in truth is poverty, so the name of luxury is
given to that which in reality is nauseousness. Do we intend ourselves
for the shambles, that we so fatten ourselves? Why cater for the worm
that it may have a sumptuous larder? Why make more of their humors
(ἰ<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxvii-p19.20"></span>χὥρας</span>)?
Why store up in yourself sources of sweat and rank smelling? Why make
yourself useless for everything? Do you wish your eye to be strong? Get
your body well strung? For in musical strings, that which is coarse and
not refined, is not fit to produce musical tones, but that which has
been well scraped, stretches well, and vibrates with full harmony. Why
do you bury the soul alive? why make the wall about it thicker? Why
increase the reek and the cloud, with fumes like a mist steaming up from
all sides? If none other, let the wrestlers teach you, that the more
spare the body, the stronger it is: and (then) also the soul is more
vigorous. In fact, it is like charioteer and horse. But there you see,
just as in the case of men giving themselves to luxury, and making
themselves plump, so the plump horses are unwieldy, and give the driver
much ado. One may think one’s self (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxvii-p19.21"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxvii-p19.22"></span>γαπητὸν</span>) well off, even with a horse
obedient to the rein and well-limbed, to be able to carry off the prize:
but when the driver is forced to drag the horse along, and when the
horse falls, though he goad him ever so much, he cannot make him get up,
be he ever so skilful himself, he will be deprived of the victory. Then
let us not endure to see our soul wronged because of the body, but let
us make the soul herself more clear-sighted, let us make her wing light,
her bonds looser: let us feed her with discourse, with frugality,
(feeding) the body only so much that it may be healthy, that it may be
vigorous, that it may rejoice and not be in pain: that having in this
sort well ordered our concerns, we may be enabled to lay hold upon the
highest virtue, and to attain unto the eternal good things by the grace
and loving-kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, with Whom, to the Father
and Holy Ghost together, be glory, dominion, honor, now and ever, world
without end. Amen.

<span id="vi.xxvii-p7"></span> i.e. what was to be drawn from them by
the torture? Had they let him out, they would have contrived
appearances, or would themselves have fled. But the reporter’s notes of
what St. Chrys. said, seem to be very defective, and the arrangement
much confused.

the recapitulation (see note 3, p. 175) he says, that the death of Herod
was regarded as a judgment for his having slain James and the soldiers.
Here, it seems, he must have said something to that effect; then, “but
observe how St. Luke does not conceal the true state of the case, viz.
that he was punished not for this, but for the sin which he proceeds to
mention.” We have transposed the text [Acts
12.20-23](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#020.md)<span
id="vi.xxvii-p8.3"></span>. <span class="c14"><span

<span id="vi.xxvii-p9"></span> Josephus’ narrative of the death of Herod
(*Ant.* xix. 8, 2) is of peculiar interest here on account of its
substantial agreement with that of Luke. The following points of
agreement may be noted: (1) The place was Cæsarea. (2) He was attacked
by disease in a public assembly when, arrayed in gorgeous apparel, he
received the impious flatteries of the people. (3) His disease and death
were a penalty for accepting the flattery of those who accorded to him
divine honors. Thus the main outlines are the same. Josephus introduces
some historical notices, such as that the occasion was a celebration in
honor of the Emperor Claudius, which are wanting in Luke. He also
relates that after receiving the people’s flattery, Herod observed an
owl perched on a rope above him, which he interpreted at once as an omen
of the fate which soon befell him. The supernatural element—“an angel
smote him”—is wanting in Josephus. The Jewish historian is less specific
in describing the disease which he speaks of as violent pains in the
bowels and adds that after the attack, Herod lingered five days and died
in the fifty-fourth year of his age and the seventh of his reign.—G.B.S.

<span id="vi.xxvii-p10"></span> At this point ([Acts
13](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#000)<span id="vi.xxvii-p10.1"></span>..md)
begins the second part of the Book of Acts which has chiefly to do with
the missionary labors of Paul. It is a reasonable supposition that the
previous chapters rest upon different documents from those which follow.
From [Acts 16](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#000.md)<span
id="vi.xxvii-p10.2"></span>. onward occur the so-called “we” passages
(e.g. [Acts 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#010.md), [Acts
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#006.md), [Acts
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#001.md), [Acts
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#001)<span id="vi.xxvii-p10.3"></span>.md)
in which the writer, identifying himself with his narratives, indicates
that he writes from personal knowledge and experience. The appointment
of Barnabas and Saul at Antioch for missionary service, marked an epoch
in the history of the early church and practically settled the questions
relating to the admission of the Gentiles to the Christian
community.—G.B.S.

Cat. “Not from men nor by men? Because not man called nor brought him
over: that is, neither by men; therefore he says, that he was not sent
(B., I was not sent) by this,” etc. The mod. text “Not from men neither
by men. The one, not from men, he uses to show that not man, etc.: and
the other, neither by men, that he was not sent by this (man), but by
the Spirit. Wherefore,” etc.

<span id="vi.xxvii-p13"></span> Here he further answers the question
raised in the opening of the discourse. The mod. text transposes it to
that place, beginning the recapitulation with, “‘And when it was day
there was no small stir among the soldiers because of Peter, and having
put the keepers to the question, he ordered them to be led away to
execution.’ So senseless was he, <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxvii-p13.1"></span>οὕτως οὐκ ᾔσθετο</span>, that he even sets
about punishing them unjustly.” The latter clause is added by the
innovator. For <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxvii-p13.2"></span>ᾔ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxvii-p13.3"></span>σθετο</span>Cat. has preserved the true

does in the last clause of the text cited, we set against this lust a
different affection, viz. vanity, especially female vanity, regard to
personal appearance. Hence that last clause might be better transposed
to the end of this sentence.
