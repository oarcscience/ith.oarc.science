<span id="vi.x-p1"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vi.x-p1.1"></span>Homily X.</span>

<span id="vi.x-p2"></span>[Acts IV.
1](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#001.md)<span id="vi.x-p2.1"></span>

<span id="vi.x-p3"></span>“And as they spake unto the people, there came
unto them the priests, and the captain of the temple.”

<span id="vi.x-p4"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="vi.x-p4.1"></span>Ere</span> yet they had time to take breath after
their first trials, straightway they enter into others. And observe how
the events are disposed. First, they were all mocked together; this was
no small trial: secondly, they enter into dangers. And these two things
do not take place in immediate succession; but when first the Apostles
have won admiration by their two discourses, and after that have
performed a notable miracle, thereupon it is that, after they are waxen
bold, through God’s disposal, they enter the lists. But I wish you to
consider, how those same persons, who in the case of Christ must need
look out for one to deliver Him up to them, now with their own hands
arrest the Apostles, having become more audacious and more impudent
since the Crucifixion. In truth, sin, while it is yet struggling to the
birth, is attended with some sense of shame; but when once fully born,
it makes those more shameless who practise it. “And the captain of the
temple,” it is said. The object again was to attach a public criminality
to what was doing, and not to prosecute it as the act of private
individuals: such in fact was constantly their plan of proceeding.

<span id="vi.x-p5"></span>“Being grieved that they taught the people.”
([Acts 4.2](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#002.md)<span
id="vi.x-p5.1"></span>.) Not merely because they taught, but because
they declared, not alone that Christ Himself was risen from the dead,
but moreover, that we through Him do rise again. “Because they taught
the people, and preached through Jesus the resurrection of the dead.” So
mighty was His Resurrection, that to others also He is the cause of a
resurrection. <span id="fr_245"></span>[246](#fn_245.md) “And they laid
hands on them, and put them in hold unto the next day; for it was now
eventide. ([Acts 4.3](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#003.md)<span
id="vi.x-p6.2"></span>.) What impudence! They <span
id="fr_246"></span>[247](#fn_246.md) feared not the multitude; for this
also the captain of the temple was with them: they had their hands still
reeking with the blood of the former victim. “For it was now eventide,”
it is said. It was with the wish to abate their spirit that those men
did this, and guarded them; but the delay only served to make the
Apostles more intrepid. And consider who these are who are arrested.
They are the chiefs of the Apostles, who are now become a pattern to the
rest, that they should no longer crave each other’s support, nor want to
be together. “Howbeit, many having heard the word, believed; and the
number of the men was about five thousand.” ([Acts
4.4](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#004)<span id="vi.x-p7.5"></span>..md) How
was this? Did they see them in honor? Did they not behold them put in
bonds? How then did they believe? Do you see the evident efficacy? And
yet even those that believed already might well have become weaker. But
no, it is no longer so: for Peter’s sermon had laid the seed deep into
them, and had taken a hold upon their understandings. Therefore were
\[their enemies\] incensed, that they did not fear them, that they made
no account of their present troubles. For, say they, if He that was
crucified effects such great things, and makes the lame to walk, we fear
not these men either. <span id="fr_247"></span>[248](#fn_247.md) This again
is of God’s ordering. For those who now believe were more numerous than
the former. Therefore it was that in their presence they bound the
Apostles, to make them also more fearful. But the reverse took place.
And they examine them not before the people, but privately, that the
hearers may not profit by their boldness.

<span id="vi.x-p9"></span>“And it came to pass on the morrow, that their
rulers, and elders, and scribes, and Annas the High Priest, and
Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of
the High Priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem.” ([Acts
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#005.md),
[6](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#006)<span id="vi.x-p9.1"></span>..md) For
now along with the other evils (of the times <span
id="fr_248"></span>[249](#fn_248) .md), the Law was no longer observed. And
again they set off the business with the form of a tribunal, to
constitute them guilty by their iniquitous sentence. “And when they had
set them in the midst, they asked, By what power, or by what name, have
ye done this?” ([Acts 4.7](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#007.md)<span
id="vi.x-p10.1"></span>.) And yet they knew it well; for it was because
they were “grieved that they preached through Jesus the resurrection”
that they arrested them. Then for what purpose do they question them?
They expected the numbers present would make them recant, and thought by
this means to have put all right again. Observe then what they say: “And
by what name have ye done this? Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost,
said unto them.” ([Acts 4.8](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#008.md)<span
id="vi.x-p10.2"></span>.) And now, I pray you, call to mind Christ’s
saying; “When they deliver you up unto the synagogues, take ye no
thought how or what thing ye shall speak; for it is the Spirit of your
Father which speaketh in you. (<span id="vi.x-p10.3"></span>[Luke
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#011.md),
[14](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#014)<span id="vi.x-p10.4"></span>..md) So
that it was a mighty Power they enjoyed. What then says Peter? “Ye
rulers of the people, and elders of Israel.” Mark the Christian wisdom
of the man; how full of confidence it is: he utters not a word of
insult, but says with respect, “Ye rulers of the people, and elders of
Israel, if we be this day called to account of the good deed done to the
impotent man.” He takes them in hand right valiantly; by the opening of
his speech he exposes <span id="fr_249"></span>[250](#fn_249.md) them, and
reminds them of the former things: that it is for a work of beneficence
they are calling them to account. As if he had said, “In all fairness we
ought to have been crowned for this deed, and proclaimed benefactors;
but since “we are even put upon our trial for a good deed done to an
impotent man,” not a rich man, not powerful, not noble—and yet who would
feel envy in a case like this?” It is a most forcible (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.x-p11.11"></span>ἀ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.x-p11.12"></span>παγγελια</span>, al. <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.x-p11.13"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.x-p11.14"></span>παγγελία</span>) way of
putting the case; and he shows that they are piercing their own
selves:—“By what means this man is made whole: be it known unto you all,
and to all the people Israel; that by the Name of Jesus Christ of
Nazareth:”—this is what would vex them most. For this was that which
Christ had told the disciples, “What ye hear in the ear that preach ye
upon the housetops.—That in the name of Jesus Christ,” he says, “of
Nazareth, Whom ye crucified, Whom God raised from the dead, even by Him
doth this man stand here before you whole.” ([Acts
4.10](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#010)<span id="vi.x-p11.15"></span>.md).
([Matt. x. 27](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#027.md)<span
id="vi.x-p11.16"></span>.) Think not, he says that we conceal the
country, or the nature of the death. “Whom ye crucified, Whom God raised
from the dead, even by Him doth this man stand before you whole.” Again
the death, again the resurrection. “This is the stone,” he says, “which
was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the
corner.” ([Acts 4.11](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#011.md)<span
id="vi.x-p11.17"></span>.) He reminds them also of a saying which was
enough to frighten them. For it had been said, “Whosoever shall fall on
this stone shall be broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will
grind him to powder. ([Matt. xxi.
44](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#044.md)<span
id="vi.x-p11.18"></span>.)—Neither is there salvation in any other,
([Acts 4.12](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#012.md)<span
id="vi.x-p11.19"></span>.) Peter says. What wounds, think you, must
these words inflict on them! “For there is none other name,” he
continues, “under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.”
Here he utters also lofty words. For when <span
id="fr_250"></span>[251](#fn_250.md) the object is, not to carry some point
successfully, but only to show boldness he does not spare; for he was
not afraid of striking too deep. Nor does he say simply, “By another;”
but, “Neither is there salvation in any other:” that is, He is able to
save us. In this way he subdued their threatening.

<span id="vi.x-p13"></span>“Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and
John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they
marvelled and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with
Jesus.” ([Acts 4.13](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#013.md)<span
id="vi.x-p13.1"></span>.) The two unlearned men beat down with their
rhetoric them and the chief priests. For it was not they that spake, but
the grace of the Spirit. “And beholding the man which was healed
standing with them, they could say nothing against it.” ([Acts
4.14](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#014)<span id="vi.x-p13.2"></span>..md)
Great was the boldness of the man; that even in the judgment-hall he has
not left them. For had they said that the fact was not so, there was he
to refute them. “But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the
council, they conferred among themselves, saying, What are we to do to
these men?” ([Acts 4.15](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#015.md)<span
id="vi.x-p13.3"></span>.) See the difficulty they are in, and how the
fear of men again does everything. As in the case of Christ, they were
not able (as the saying is) to undo what is done, <span
id="fr_251"></span>[252](#fn_251.md) nor to cast it into the shade, but for
all their hindering, the Faith did but gain ground the more; so was it
now. “What shall we do?” O the folly! to suppose that those who had
tasted of the conflict, would now take fright at it: to expect, impotent
as their efforts had proved in the beginning, to effect something new,
after such a specimen of oratory as had been exhibited! The more they
wished to hinder, the more the business grew upon their hands. But what
say they? “For that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them is
manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it. But
that it spread no further among the people, let us straightly threaten
them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name. And they called
them, and commanded them not to speak at all, nor teach, in the name of
Jesus.” ([Acts 4.16-18](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#016.md)<span
id="vi.x-p14.9"></span>.) See what effrontery is shown by these, and
what greatness of mind by the Apostles. “But Peter and John answered and
said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto
you more than unto God, judge ye. For we cannot but speak the things
which we have seen and heard. So when they had further threatened them,
they let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of
the people.” ([Acts 4.19-21](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#019.md)<span
id="vi.x-p14.10"></span>.) The miracles shut their mouths: they would
not so much as let them finish their speech, but cut them short in the
middle, most insolently. “For all men glorified God for that which was
done. For the man was above forty years old, on whom this miracle of
healing was showed.” ([Acts 4.22](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#022.md)<span
id="vi.x-p14.11"></span>.) But let us look over what has been said from
the beginning.

<span id="vi.x-p15"></span>“And as they spake unto the people, etc.
Being grieved that they taught the people, and preached through Jesus
the resurrection of the dead.” (Recapitulation, [Acts
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#001.md),
[2](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#002)<span id="vi.x-p15.1"></span>..md)
So <span id="fr_252"></span>[253](#fn_252.md) then at first they did all
for the sake of man’s opinion (or glory): but now another motive was
added: that they should not be thought guilty of murder, as they said
subsequently, “Do ye wish to bring this man’s blood on us?” ([Acts
5.28](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#028)<span id="vi.x-p16.2"></span>..md) O
the folly! Persuaded that He was risen, and having received this proof
of it, <span id="fr_253"></span>[254](#fn_253.md) they expected that He
Whom death could not hold, could be cast into the shade by their
machinations! What can match the folly of this! <span
id="fr_254"></span>[255](#fn_254.md) Such is the nature of wickedness: it
has no eyes for anything, but on all occasions it is thrown into
perturbation. Finding themselves overborne, they felt like persons who
have been outwitted: as is the case with people who have been
forestalled and made a sport of in some matter. And yet <span
id="fr_255"></span>[256](#fn_255.md) they everywhere affirmed that it was
God that raised Him: but <span id="fr_256"></span>[257](#fn_256.md) it was
“in the Name of Jesus” that they spake; showing that Jesus was risen.
“Through Jesus, the resurrection of the dead”: for they themselves also
held a resurrection: a cold and puerile doctrine, indeed, but still they
held it. Why this alone, was it not sufficient to induce them to do
nothing to them—I mean, that the disciples with such boldness bore
themselves in the way they did? Say, wherefore, O Jew, dost thou
disbelieve? Thou oughtest to have attended to the sign done, and to the
words, not to the evil disposition of the many. “By their teaching the
people.” <span id="fr_257"></span>[258](#fn_257.md) For already they were
in ill repute with them by reason of what they had done to Christ; so
that they were rather increasing their own obloquy. “And they laid hands
on them, and put them in hold until the morrow; for it was now
eventide.” ([Acts 4.3](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#003.md)<span
id="vi.x-p21.6"></span>.) In the case of Christ, however, they did not
so; but having taken Him at midnight, they immediately led him away, and
made no delay, being exceedingly in fear of the multitude: whereas in
the case of the Apostles here, they were bold. And they no more take
them to Pilate, being ashamed and blushing at the thought of the former
affair, lest they should also be taken to task for that.

<span id="vi.x-p22"></span>“And it came to pass on the morrow, that
their rulers, and elders, and scribes were gathered together at
Jerusalem.” ([Acts 4.5](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#005.md)<span
id="vi.x-p22.1"></span>.) Again in Jerusalem: and there it is that men’s
blood is poured out; no reverence for their city either; “And Annas, and
Caiaphas,” etc. ([Acts 4.6](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#006.md)<span
id="vi.x-p22.2"></span>.) “And Annas,” it says, “and Caiaphas.” His
maid-servant it was that questioned Peter, and he could not bear it: in
his house it was that Peter denied, when Another was in bonds there: but
now, when he has come into the midst of them all, see how he speaks! “By
what name have ye done this?” Why dost thou not speak it, what it is,
but keepest that out of sight? “By what name have ye done this?” ([Acts
4.7](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#007)<span id="vi.x-p22.3"></span>..md) And
yet he affirmed, It was not we that did it. “Ye rulers of the people,”
etc. ([Acts 4.8](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#008.md)<span
id="vi.x-p22.4"></span>.) Observe his wisdom: he does not say outright,
“In the Name of Jesus we did it,” but how? “In His Name this man”—He
does not say, “was made whole by us;” but—“doth stand here before you
whole.” And again, “If we be examined concerning the good deed done to
the impotent man.” ([Acts 4.9](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#009.md)<span
id="vi.x-p22.5"></span>.) He hits them hard, that they are always making
a crime of such acts, finding fault with works of beneficence done to
men: and he reminds them of their former doings, that *they* run to do
murder, and not only so, but make a crime of doing good deeds. Do you
observe too (in point of rhetoric) with what dignity they express
themselves? <span id="fr_258"></span>[259](#fn_258.md) Even in the use of
words they were becoming expert by practice, and henceforth they were
not to be beaten down. <span id="fr_259"></span>[260](#fn_259.md) “Be it
known unto you all,” etc. ([Acts
4.10](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#010)<span id="vi.x-p24.6"></span>..md)
Whereby he shows them that they rather do, in spite of themselves,
preach Christ; themselves extol the doctrine, by their examining and
questioning. O exceeding boldness—“Whom ye crucified! Whom God raised
up”—this is bolder still! Think not that we hide what there is to be
ashamed of. He says this all but tauntingly: and not merely says it, but
dwells upon the matter. “This,” says he, “is the Stone which was set at
naught by you builders;” and then he goes on to teach them, saying in
addition, “Which is made the head of the corner” ([Acts
4.11](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#011)<span id="vi.x-p24.7"></span>..md);
that is to say, that the Stone is indeed approved! Great was the
boldness they now had, in consequence of the miracle. And when there was
need to teach, observe how they speak and allege many prophecies; but
when the point was to use boldness of speech, then they only speak
peremptorily. Thus “Neither,” says he, “is there any other name under
heaven given among men whereby we must be saved.” ([Acts
4.12](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#012)<span id="vi.x-p24.8"></span>..md) It
is manifest to all, he says, because not to us alone was that Name
given; he cites even themselves as witnesses. For, since they asked, “In
what name did ye it?” “In Christ’s,” says he: “there is none other name.
How is it that ye ask? On all hands this is palpable. “For there exists
not another name under heaven, whereby we must be saved.” This is the
language of a soul which has renounced (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.x-p24.9"></span>κατεγνωκυίας</span>) this present life. His
exceeding out-spokenness proves here, that when he speaks in lowly terms
of Christ, he does it not of fear, but of wise forbearance (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.x-p24.10"></span>συγκαταβαίνων</span>): but
now that it was the fitting time, he speaks not in lowly terms: by this
very thing intending to strike dismay into them. Behold another miracle
not less than the former. “And beholding the boldness of Peter and
John,” etc. “And they took knowledge of them that they had been with
Jesus.” ([Acts 4.13](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#013.md)<span
id="vi.x-p24.11"></span>.) Not without a meaning has the Evangelist set
down this passage; but in saying, “they recognized them that they had
been with Jesus,” he means, in His Passion: for only these were \[with
Him\] at that time, and then indeed they had seen them humble, dejected:
and this it was that most surprised them: the greatness of the change.
For in fact Annas and Caiaphas with their company were there, and these
then also had stood by Him, and their boldness now amazed them. “And
beholding the boldness.” For <span id="fr_260"></span>[261](#fn_260.md) not
only their words; their very bearing showed it; that they should stand
there so intrepidly to be tried in a cause like this, and with uttermost
peril impending over them! Not only by their words, but by their gesture
also, and their look and voice, and, in short, by everything about them,
they manifested the boldness with which they confronted the people. From
the things they uttered, they marvelled, perhaps: “that they were
unlearned and common men:” for one may be unlearned, yet not a common or
private man, and a common man, yet not unlearned. “Having perceived,” it
says. Whence? From <span id="fr_261"></span>[262](#fn_261.md) what they
said? Peter does not draw out long speeches, but then by his very manner
and method (<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.x-p26.11"></span>τἥς
ἀπαγγελίας καὶ τἥς συνθήκης</span>) he declares his confidence. “And
they recognized them that they had been with Jesus.” Which circumstance
made them believe that it was from Him they had learned these things,
and that they did all in the character of His disciples. <span
id="fr_262"></span>[263](#fn_262.md) But not less than the voice of these,
the miracle uttered a voice of its own: and that sign itself stopped
their mouths. \[“And beholding the man,” etc.\] So that they would have
been peremptory (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.x-p27.1"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.x-p27.2"></span>πέσκηψαν</span>) with them, if the man had not
been with them. “We cannot deny it.” So that they would have denied it,
if the thing had not been so: if the testimony had not been that of the
people in general. “But that it spread no further among the people.”
([Acts 4.17](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#017.md)<span
id="vi.x-p27.3"></span>.) And yet it was palpable to all men! But such
is the nature of wickedness: everywhere it is shamed. “Let us straitly
threaten them.” What sayest thou? Threaten? And expect ye to stop the
preaching? And <span id="fr_263"></span>[264](#fn_263.md) yet all
beginnings are hard and trying. Ye slew the Master, and did not stop it:
and now, if ye threaten, do ye expect to turn us back? The imprisonment
did not prevail with us to speak submissively, and shall ye prevail?
“And they called them, and commanded them,” etc. ([Acts
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#018.md),
[19](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#019)<span id="vi.x-p28.3"></span>..md)
It <span id="fr_264"></span>[265](#fn_264.md) had been much better for them
to let them go. “And Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether
it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God,
judge ye.” When the terror was abated (for that command was tantamount
to their being dismissed), then also the Apostles speak more mildly: so
far were they from mere bravery: “Whether <span
id="fr_265"></span>[266](#fn_265.md) it be right,” says he: and “We cannot
\[but speak\]. Whether it be right in the sight of God to obey you
rather than God.” ([Acts 4.20](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#020.md)<span
id="vi.x-p30.3"></span>.) Here \[by “God”\] they mean Christ, for he it
was that commanded them. And once more they confirm the fact of His
Resurrection. “For we cannot but speak the things we have seen and
heard:” so that we are witnesses who have a right to be believed. “So
when they had further threatened them.” ([Acts
4.21](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#021)<span id="vi.x-p30.4"></span>..md)
Again they threatened in vain. “They let them go, finding nothing how
they might punish them, because of the people: for all men glorified God
for that which was done.” So then the people glorified God, but these
endeavored to destroy them: such fighters against God were they! Whereby
they made them more conspicuous and illustrious. “For My strength,” it
is said, “is made perfect in weakness.” (<span id="vi.x-p30.5"></span>[2
Cor. xii. 9](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#009.md)<span
id="vi.x-p30.6"></span>.)

<span id="vi.x-p31"></span>Already these as martyrs have borne
testimony: set in the battle against all, they said, “We cannot but
speak the things we have seen and heard.” If the things we speak be
false, reprehend them; if true, why hinderest thou? Such is philosophy!
Those, in perplexity, these in gladness: those covered with exceeding
shame, these doing all with boldness: those in fear, these in
confidence. For who, I would ask, were the frightened? those who said,
“That it spread no further among people,” or these who said, “we cannot
but speak the things we have seen and heard?” And these had a delight, a
freedom of speech, a joy surpassing all; those a despondency, a shame, a
fear; for they feared the people. But these were not afraid of those; on
the contrary, while these spake what they would, those did not what they
would. Which were in chains and dangers? was it not these last?

<span id="vi.x-p32"></span>Let us then hold fast to virtue; let not
these words end only in delight, and in a certain elevation of the
spirits. This is not the theatre, for singers (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.x-p32.1"></span>κιθαρώδων</span>), and tragedians, and musicians
(<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.x-p32.2"></span>κιθαριστὥν</span>),
where the fruit consists only in the enjoyment and where the enjoyment
itself passes with the passing day. Nay, would that it were enjoyment
alone, and not mischief also with the enjoyment! But so it is: each man
carries home with him much of what he has witnessed there, sticking to
him like the infection of a plague: and one indeed, of the younger sort,
having culled such snatches of song here and there of those satanic
plays, <span id="fr_266"></span>[267](#fn_266.md) as he could fix in his
memory, goes singing them about the house: while another, a senior, and
forsooth too staid for such levity, does not this indeed, but what is
there spoken, both the preachments and the very words, he remembers it
all; and another again, some filthy and absurd ditty. From this place
you depart, taking nothing with you.—We have laid down a law—nay, not
we: God forbid! for it is said, “Call no man your master upon the earth”
([Matt. xxiii. 8](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#008.md)<span
id="vi.x-p33.8"></span>); Christ has laid down a law that none should
swear. Now, say, what has been done with regard to this law? For I will
not cease speaking of it; “lest,” as the Apostle saith, “if I come
again, I must not spare.” ([2 Cor. xiii.
2](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#002)<span id="vi.x-p33.9"></span>..md) I ask
then, have you laid the matter to heart? have you thought of it
seriously? have you been in earnest about it, or must we again take up
the same subject? Nay, rather, whether you have or not, we will resume
it, that you may think seriously about it, or, if you have laid it to
heart, may again do this the more surely, and exhort others also. With
what then, I pray you, with what shall we begin? Shall it be with the
Old Testament? For indeed this also is to our shame, that the precepts
of the Law, which we ought to surpass, we do not even thus observe! For
we ought not to be hearing such matters as these: these are precepts
adapted to the poor Jewish level (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.x-p33.10"></span>τἥς ᾽Ιουδαἳκἥς εὐτελείας</span>): *we* ought to
be hearing those counsels of perfection; “Cast away thy property, stand
courageously, and give up thy life in behalf of the Gospel, scorn all
the goods of earth, have nothing in common with this present life; if
any wrong thee, do him good; if any defraud thee, bless him; if any
revile thee, show him honor; be above everything.” (S. Ambros. *de Off.*
i. 2.) These and such as these are what we ought to be hearing. But here
are we discoursing about swearing; and our case is just the same as if,
when a person ought to be a philosopher, one should take him away from
the great masters, and set him to spell syllables letter by letter! Just
think now what a disgrace it would be for a man having a flowing beard,
and with staff in hand, and cope on shoulders, <span
id="fr_267"></span>[268](#fn_267.md) to go to school with children, and be
set the same tasks with them: would it not be above measure ridiculous?
And yet the ridicule which belongs to us is even greater. For not as the
difference between philosophy and the spelling-lesson, so is that
between the Jewish polity and ours: no indeed, but as the difference
between angels and men. Say now, if one could fetch down an angel from
heaven, and should bid him stand here and listen to our preaching, as
one whose duty it is to conform himself thereto, would it not be
shameful and preposterous? But if to be yet, like children, under
teaching about these things be ridiculous; what must it be, not even to
attend to these things: how great the condemnation, how great the shame!
To be Christians still, and to have to learn that it is not right to
swear! However, let us put up with that, lest we incur even worse
ridicule.

<span id="vi.x-p35"></span>Well, then, let us speak to you to-day from
the Old Testament. What does it tell us? “Accustom not thy mouth to
swearing; neither use thyself to the naming of the Holy One.” And why?
“For as a servant that is continually beaten shall not be without a blue
mark, so he that sweareth.” ([Ecclesiasticus
23.10](../../../bib/apo/sir023.htm#010)<span id="vi.x-p35.1"></span>..md)
See the discernment of this wise man. He did not say, “Accustom not to
swearing” thy mind, but “thy mouth”; because being altogether an affair
of the mouth, thus it is easily remedied. For at last it becomes a habit
without intention; as for instance, there are many who entering the
public baths, as soon as they have passed the threshold, cross (Hom. in
[1 Cor. xi. 7](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#007.md)<span
id="vi.x-p35.2"></span>) themselves (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.x-p35.3"></span>σφραγίζονται</span>). <span
id="fr_268"></span>[269](#fn_268.md) This the hand has got to do, without
any one’s bidding, by force of habit. Again, at the lighting of a
candle, often when the mind is intent on something else, the hand makes
the sign. In the same way also the mouth, without concurrence of the
mind, articulates the word, from mere habit, and the whole affair is in
the tongue. “Neither use thyself,” he says, “to the naming of the Holy
One. For as a servant that is continually beaten shall not be without a
blue mark, so he that sweareth.” He speaks not here of false oaths, but
he cuts down all oaths, and to them also assigns their punishment. Why
then, swearing is a sin. For such in truth is the soul; full of all
these ulcers, all these scars. But you do not see them? Yes, this is the
mischief of it; and yet you might see if you wished; for God has given
you eyes. With eyes of this kind did the Prophet see, when he said, “My
wounds stink, and are corrupt, because of my foolishness.” (<span
id="vi.x-p36.1"></span>[Ps. xxxviii.
5](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#005)<span id="vi.x-p36.2"></span>..md) We
have despised God, we have hated that good Name, we have trodden Christ
under foot, we have lost all reverence, none names the Name of God with
honor. Yet if you love any one, even at his name you start to your feet;
but God you thus continually invoke, and make nothing of it. Call upon
Him for the benefit of your enemy; call upon Him for the salvation of
your own soul; then he will be present, then you will delight Him;
whereas now you provoke Him to anger. Call upon Him as Stephen did;
“Lord,” he said, “lay not this sin to their charge.” ([Acts
7.59](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#059)<span id="vi.x-p36.3"></span>..md)
Call upon Him as did the wife of Elkanah, with tears and sobs, and
prayers. ([1 Sam. i. 10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#010.md)<span
id="vi.x-p36.4"></span>.) I prevent you not, rather I earnestly exhort
you to it. Call upon him as Moses called upon Him, yea, cried,
interceding for those <span id="fr_269"></span>[270](#fn_269.md) who had
driven him into banishment. For you to make mention at random of any
person of consideration, is taken as an insult: and do you bandy God
about in your talk, in season, out of season? I do not want to hinder
you from keeping God always in your mind: nay, this I even desire and
pray for, only that you should do this, so as to honor Him. Great good
would this have done us, if we had called upon God only when we ought,
and for what we ought. And why, I would ask, were such miracles wrought
in the Apostles’ times, and not in ours? And yet it is the same God, the
same Name. But no, the case is not the same. For then they called upon
Him only for those objects which I have mentioned; whereas we call upon
Him not for these, but quite other purposes.—If a man refuse to believe
you, and that is why you swear, say to him, “Believe me:” however, if
you will needs make oath, swear by yourself. I say this, not to set up a
law against Christ’s law; God forbid; for it is said. “Let your yea be
yea, and your nay, nay ([Matt. v.
37](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#037)<span id="vi.x-p37.14"></span>.md): but
by way of coming down to your present level, that I may more easily lead
you to the practice of this commandment, and divert you from this
tyrannical habit. How many who have done well in other respects, have
been undone by these practices! Shall I tell you why it was permitted
the ancients to take oaths? (for to take false oaths, was not permitted
to them either.) Because they swore by idols. But are you not ashamed to
rest in laws, by which they in their infirmity were led on to something
better? It is true, when I take a Gentile in hand, I do not immediately
lay this injunction upon him, but in the first place I exhort him to
know Christ; but if the believer, who has both learnt Him and heard Him,
must needs crave the same forbearance with the Gentile, what is the use,
what the gain (of his Christianity?)—But the habit is strong, and you
cannot detach yourself from it? Well then, since the tyranny of habit is
so great, transfer it into another channel. And how is this to be done?
you will ask. What I have said often, I say also now; let there be many
monitors (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.x-p37.15"></span>λογισταὶ</span>), let there be many examiners
and censors (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.x-p37.16"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.x-p37.17"></span>ξετασταὶ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.x-p37.18"></span>,</span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.x-p37.19"></span>δοκιμασταί</span>). Say, if you chance to put on
your <span id="fr_270"></span>[271](#fn_270.md) mantle inside out, you
allow your servant to correct your mistake, and are ashamed to learn of
him, although there is much to be ashamed of in this; and here when you
are getting hurt to your soul, are you ashamed to be taught better by
another? You suffer your menial to put your dress in order, and to
fasten your shoes, and will you not endure him that would put your soul
in order? Let even your menial, your child, your wife, your friend, your
kinsman, your neighbor, be your teachers on this point. For as when a
wild beast is hunted down from all sides, it is impossible for it to
escape; so he that has so many to watch him, so many to reprove him, who
is liable to be struck at from all sides, cannot help being on his
guard. The first day he will find it hard to put up with, and the
second, and the third; but after that it will come easier, and, the
fourth passed, there will not even be anything to do. Make the
experiment, if you doubt me; take it into consideration, I beseech you.
It is not a trifling matter to be wrong in, nor yet to come right in; on
both sides it is great for evil and for good. May the good be effected,
through the grace and loving-mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ, to Whom
with the Father and the Holy Ghost be glory, power, and honor, now and
ever, world without end. Amen.

<span id="vi.x-p6"></span> It is more likely that <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.x-p6.1"></span>καταγγέλειν ἐν τῶ ᾽Ιησοῦ τὴν
ἀνάστασιν κ. τ. λ</span>. means “to declare in (the case of) Jesus the
resurrection,” i.e. that the reference is specifically to the
resurrection of Jesus instead of (as Chrys.) to the resurrection
generally.—G.B.S.

<span id="vi.x-p7"></span> So A. C. N. Cat. but B. omits <span

their hands still reeking with the blood of their former victim and they
were not chilled (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.x-p7.2"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.x-p7.3"></span>νάρκων</span>), but again laid them upon others,
to fill them with fresh blood. Or perhaps also they feared them as
having now become a multitude, and for this reason the captain,” etc.
But the statement, <span class="Greek"><span id="vi.x-p7.4"></span>οὐκ
ἔδεισαν τὸ πλῆθος</span> is explained in the Recapitulation: they led
Christ to trial immediately, for fear of the multitude; but not so here.

<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.x-p8.4"></span>ἔ</span><span

obscure, especially the emphatic <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.x-p8.6"></span>οὐδὲ τούτους</span>: but perhaps it may be
explained: “He was crucified; they did their worst to Him, to how little
purpose! therefore neither need we fear these men, what they can do to
us.” But the report is otherwise so defective and confused, that perhaps
what Chrys. actually said here was meant of the priests: “We were able
to crucify the Master, therefore we do not fear these common men, His
followers, though, as they say, it is He that does these works, that
made the lame man walk.”

the nature of a challenge ([Acts

it known to *you all,*” etc., and the assertion that it was in the name
which they despised—the “Nazarene”—that the miracle had been wrought and
all this is pointed by the contrast: “Ye crucified” but “God raised” and
the charge of opposition to the divine plan in that they had rejected
the stone which God had made the head of the corner.—G.B.S.

the next sentence is, <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.x-p26.4"></span>ὥ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.x-p26.5"></span>στε ἐπέσκηψαν ἂν αὐτοῖς</span>, *Extrema
auctoritate mandassent iis,* Erasm. *Acrius in eos egissent,* Ben. Here
and in what follows we have endeavored to restore the proper order. In
the <span class="c14"><span id="vi.x-p26.6"></span>mss.</span> in
consequence, as it seems, of a confusion between the two clauses, <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.x-p26.7"></span>οὐ δυνάμεθα
ἀρνήσασθαι</span>, and <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.x-p26.8"></span>οὐ δυνάμεθα γὰρ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.x-p26.9"></span>…</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.x-p26.10"></span>μὴ λαλεῖν</span>, the order of the comments is
deranged: viz. “So that they would—been with them.” “And they
recognized—stopped their mouths:” “‘Whether it be right—judge ye.’ When
the terror—mere bravery. ‘Whether it be right,’ he says, and, ‘We cannot
deny it.’ So that they would—better to let them go. ‘Whether it be
right—more than unto God.’ Here by God—His Resurrection.”

id="vi.x-p26.12"></span>

<span id="vi.x-p27"></span> The author seems to give two different
interpretations of the statement: “They recognized them that they had
been with Jesus.” (1) They perceived that these were the men whom they
had before seen in company with Jesus. (2) They saw that their words and
acts betokened association with Jesus. It is evident that the former
only is meant in this place.—G.B.S.

<span id="vi.x-p28"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.x-p28.1"></span>Καίτοι πανταχοῦ αἱ ἀρχαὶ δειναὶ καὶ
δύσκολοι</span>. “If at the beginning you failed, how can you expect to
succeed now? for the beginning being always the hardest part of any
difficult undertaking, if you could not stop it then, much less
afterwards.” The modern text unnecessarily alters it to <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.x-p28.2"></span>οὕπω π. αἱ ἀ. χαλεπαί τε καὶ
δυσκ</span>.

<span id="fn_264"></span>[i:265](1110015.htm#fr_264.md) <span

<span id="vi.x-p29"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.x-p29.1"></span>Πολλῷ μᾶλλον αὐτοῖς βέλτιον ἦν αὐτοὺς
ἀφεῖναι</span>. N. has a colon at <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.x-p29.2"></span>αὐτοῖς</span>, which perhaps is better; then the
first clause may be the comment on <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.x-p29.3"></span>τὸ καθόλου μὴ φθέγγεσθαι</span>: “not to speak at
all: much more to them. It had been better to dismiss them (at once).”
For this sentence E. alone has, <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.x-p29.4"></span>Πάνυ γε, τοὺς οὐδὲν ὑμᾶς ἡγουμένους καὶ
ἀπειλοῦντας</span>: “Aye, men who make nothing of you for all your
threatening:” which is adopted by Edd.

<span id="fn_265"></span>[i:266](1110015.htm#fr_265.md) <span
id="vi.x-p29.5"></span>

<span id="vi.x-p30"></span> E. and Edd. “That a notable miracle is done,
we cannot deny:” and below “Here they say, of God, for, ‘of Christ.’ Do
you see how that is fulfilled which He said unto them, ‘Behold I send
you as sheep in the midst of wolves; fear them not.’ Then once more they
confirm,” etc. For <span class="Greek"><span id="vi.x-p30.1"></span>τοῦ
Θεοῦ</span>, A. B. have <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.x-p30.2"></span>τοῦ Χριστοῦ</span>.

<span id="fn_266"></span>[i:267](1110015.htm#fr_266.md) <span

<span id="vi.x-p33"></span> The various readings are <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.x-p33.1"></span>ᾀ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.x-p33.2"></span>σμάτων</span> for <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.x-p33.3"></span>δραμάτων</span>, and <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.x-p33.4"></span>μέρη</span> for <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.x-p33.5"></span>μέλη</span>. Below, <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.x-p33.6"></span>τῶν δὲ ἐκεῖσε λεγομένων καὶ
κηρυγμάτων καὶ ῥημάτων μέμνηται πάντων</span>. The mod, omits <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.x-p33.7"></span>καὶ κηρ</span>. The meaning
is, “He cannot carry away in his memory the preaching which he hears in
Church: but the preachments (proclamations) which he hears in the
theatre he remember, every word.”

<span id="fn_267"></span>[i:268](1110015.htm#fr_267.md) <span
id="vi.x-p33.11"></span>

<span id="vi.x-p34"></span> A description of the attire of a
philosopher. Lucian mentions the long beard and the staff, but as the
vestment, the <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.x-p34.1"></span>τριβώνιον</span> or *tritum pallium.* The <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.x-p34.2"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.x-p34.3"></span>ξωμὶς</span> elsewhere
denotes (in opposition to <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.x-p34.4"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.x-p34.5"></span>πωμὶς</span>) a tunic without sleeves, forming
part of the dress of old men, and slaves, and also used in comedy. Here
it seems to mean a cope, perhaps (Doun. ap. Savil.), the original of the
academic hood, *caputium.*

<span id="fn_268"></span>[i:269](1110015.htm#fr_268.md) <span
id="vi.x-p35.4"></span>

<span id="vi.x-p36"></span> *Tertull. de Corona militum. “Ad omnem
progressum atque promotum, ad omnen aditum et exitum, ad calceatum, ad
lavacra, ad mensas, ad lumina, ad cubilia, ad sedilia, quæcunque nos
conversatio exercet, frontem crucis signaculo terimus.”*

<span id="fn_269"></span>[i:270](1110015.htm#fr_269.md) <span
id="vi.x-p36.5"></span>

<span id="vi.x-p37"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.x-p37.1"></span>ὑ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.x-p37.2"></span>πὲρ τῶν φυγαδευσάντων αὐτόν</span>. When the
“intercession” of Moses is spoken of, it is natural to suppose that the
reference is to <span id="vi.x-p37.3"></span>[Exod. xxxii.
11](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#011.md)<span id="vi.x-p37.4"></span> ff.
But Sav. and Ben. refer this to [Num. xii.
13](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#013.md)<span id="vi.x-p37.5"></span>,
perhaps because of <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.x-p37.6"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.x-p37.7"></span>βόα</span> (LXX. <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.x-p37.8"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.x-p37.9"></span>βόησε</span>). But the addition, “for those who
had driven him into banishment,” does not suit the latter and less
memorable occasion: for Miriam and Aaron did but “speak against Moses,”
not attempt to banish or expel him. More fully expressed, the meaning
may be, “For a people who began by making him a fugitive, <span
id="vi.x-p37.10"></span>[Ex. ii.
15](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#015.md)<span id="vi.x-p37.11"></span>,
[Acts vii. 29](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#029.md)<span
id="vi.x-p37.12"></span>, and now had put the finishing stroke to their
ingratitude.” Comp. [Exod. 17:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#004.md), [Num.
14:10](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#010.md),
[13](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#013.md)<span id="vi.x-p37.13"></span>,
etc.

<span id="fn_270"></span>[i:271](1110015.htm#fr_270.md) <span
id="vi.x-p37.20"></span>

<span id="vi.x-p38"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.x-p38.1"></span>ἂ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.x-p38.2"></span>ν μὲν τὸν βίρρον ἐναλλὰξ περιβάλῃ</span>. A. N.
<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.x-p38.3"></span>βίρον</span>. B. C.
<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.x-p38.4"></span>βίον</span> (the word
<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.x-p38.5"></span>βίρρος</span>,
*birrhus* having perhaps become obsolete). Mod. <span
