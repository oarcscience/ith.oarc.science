<span id="vi.xi-p1"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vi.xi-p1.1"></span>Homily XI.</span>

<span id="vi.xi-p2"></span>[Acts IV.
23](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#023.md)<span id="vi.xi-p2.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xi-p3"></span>“And being let go, they went to their own
company, and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said
unto them.”

<span id="vi.xi-p4"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="vi.xi-p4.1"></span>Not</span> for their own glory did they tell the
tale—how should such be their motive?—but what they displayed was the
proofs therein exhibited of the grace of Christ. All that their
adversaries had said, this they told; their own part, it is likely, they
omitted: this made the hearers all the more courageous. What then? These
again flee to the true Succor, to the Alliance invincible, and again,
“with one accord. And when they heard that,” it is said, “with one
accord they lifted up their voice to God, and said:” ([Acts
4.24](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#024)<span id="vi.xi-p4.2"></span>.md) and
with great earnestness, for it is no prayer made at random. Observe with
what exquisite propriety their prayers are framed: thus, when they
besought to be shown who was meet for the Apostleship, they said, “Thou,
Lord, which knowest the heart of all men, show:” ([Acts
1.24](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#024)<span id="vi.xi-p4.3"></span>.md) for
it was a subject for Prescience there: but here, where the thing needed
was that the mouths of their adversaries should be stopped, they speak
of lordship; wherefore they begin thus: Lord, “(<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xi-p4.4"></span>Δέσποτα</span>) the God that
madest heaven and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is:
Who, <span id="fr_271"></span>[272](#fn_271.md) by the Holy Ghost through
the mouth of Thy servant, David our father, didst say, Why did the
heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things? The kings of the earth
stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord, and
against His Christ.” ([Acts
4.24-26](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#024.md)<span
id="vi.xi-p5.11"></span>.) It is to sue God, as one may say upon His own
covenants, that they thus produce this prophecy: and at the same time to
comfort themselves with the thought, that in vain are all the
imaginations of their foes. This then is what they say: Bring those
words into accomplishment, and show that they “imagine vain things.—For
of a truth,” they proceed, “there were gathered together in this city,
against Thy holy Child Jesus, (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xi-p5.12"></span>Παἵδα</span>) Whom Thou hast anointed, both
Herod, and Pontius Pilate, together with the Gentiles and the people of
Israel, for to do whatsoever Thy hand and Thy counsel determined before
to be done. And now, Lord, behold their threatenings.” ([Acts
4.27-29](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#027.md)<span
id="vi.xi-p5.13"></span>.) Observe their largeness of mind (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xi-p5.14"></span>φιλοσοφίαν</span>). These
are not words of imprecation. In saying, “their threatenings, they do
not mean this or that thing specifically threatened, but only in
general, the fact of their threatening, perhaps, as being formidable. In
fact, the writer is concise in his narrative. And observe, they do not
say, “Crush them, cast them down;” but what? “And grant unto Thy
servants, that with all boldness they may speak Thy word.” Let us also
learn thus to pray. And yet how full of wrath one would be, when fallen
among men intent upon killing him, and making threats to that effect?
how full of animosity? But not so these saints. “By stretching forth
Thine hand to heal, and that signs and wonders may be done by the Name
of Thy holy Child Jesus.” ([Acts
4.30](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#030)<span id="vi.xi-p5.15"></span>..md)
If in that Name the mighty deeds are wrought, great will be the
boldness.

<span id="vi.xi-p6"></span>“And when they had prayed, the place was
shaken where they were assembled together.” ([Acts
4.31](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#031)<span id="vi.xi-p6.1"></span>..md)
This was the proof that they were heard, and of His visitation. “And
they were all filled with the Holy Ghost.” What means, “They were
filled?” It means, They were inflamed; and the Gift burned up within
them. “And they spake the word of God with boldness. And the multitude
of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul.” ([Acts
4.32](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#032)<span id="vi.xi-p6.2"></span>..md) Do
you see that together with the grace of God they also contributed their
part? For everywhere it ought to be well observed, that together with
the grace of God they do their part likewise. Just as Peter said above,
“Silver and gold have I none”; and again, that “they were all <span
id="fr_272"></span>[273](#fn_272.md) together.” ([Acts
3.6](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#006)<span id="vi.xi-p7.8"></span>..md) But
in this place, having mentioned that they were heard, the sacred writer
proceeds to speak also of them, what virtue they showed. Moreover, he is
just about to enter upon the narrative of Sapphira and Ananias, and with
a view to show the detestable conduct of that pair, he first discourses
of the noble behavior of the rest. Now say, did their love beget their
poverty, or the poverty the love? In my opinion, the love begat the
poverty, and then the poverty drew tight the cords of love. For observe
what he says: “They were all of one heart and of one soul.”
Behold, <span id="fr_273"></span>[274](#fn_273.md) heart and soul are what
make the “together.” “Neither said any of them that aught of the things
which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common. And with
great power the Apostles rendered their testimony (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xi-p8.3"></span>ἀ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xi-p8.4"></span>πεδίδουν</span>) of the
resurrection.” ([Acts 4.33](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#033.md)<span
id="vi.xi-p8.5"></span>.) The phrase betokens them to be as persons put
in trust with a deposit: he speaks of it as a debt or obligation: that
is, their testimony they with boldness did render, or pay off, to all.
“And great grace was upon them all. Neither was there any among them
that lacked.” ([Acts 4.34](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#034.md)<span
id="vi.xi-p8.6"></span>.) Their feeling was just as if they were under
the paternal roof, all for awhile <span
id="fr_274"></span>[275](#fn_274.md) sharing alike. It is not to be said,
that though indeed they maintained the rest, yet they did it with the
feeling that the means whereof they maintained them were still their
own. No, the admirable circumstance is this, that they first alienated
their property, and so maintained the rest, on purpose that the
maintenance might not come as of their own private means, but as of the
common property. “For as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold
them, and brought the price of the things that were sold, and laid them
down at the Apostles’ feet; and distribution was made unto every man
according as he had need.” ([Acts
4.35](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#035)<span id="vi.xi-p9.7"></span>..md) A
great mark of honor this, that “they laid them at the Apostles’ feet.
And Joses, who by the Apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (‘which is, being
interpreted, The son of consolation.’)” ([Acts
4.36](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#036)<span id="vi.xi-p9.8"></span>..md) I
do not think that this is the same with the companion of Matthias; for
that person was also called Justus and \[Barsabas, but this, Joses and\]
“Barnabas” \[“son of consolation“\]. I suppose he also received the name
from his virtue, as being qualified and suited for this duty. “A Levite,
and of the country of Cyprus by birth.” Observe on all occasions how the
writer indicates the breaking up of the Law. But how was he also a
“Cyprian by birth?” Because they then even removed to other countries,
and still were called Levites. “Having land, sold it, and brought the
price, and laid it at the Apostles’ feet. <span
id="fr_275"></span>[276](#fn_275.md) ”

<span id="vi.xi-p11"></span>Let us now look over again what has been
said. \[“And being let go, they went to their own company, and reported
all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them.”\]
(Recapitulation, [Acts 4.23](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#023.md)<span
id="vi.xi-p11.1"></span>.) See the unostentatious conduct of the
Apostles, and their largeness of mind. They did not go about boasting,
and say, “How we served (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xi-p11.2"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xi-p11.3"></span>πεχρησάμεθα</span>) the priests!” nor were they
ambitious of honor: but, we read, “they came unto their own company.
Observe how they do not cast themselves upon temptations, but when the
temptations present themselves, with courage endure them. Had it been
some other of the disciples, perhaps, emboldened by the countenance of
the multitude, he might have insulted, might have vented ever so many
harsh expressions. But not so these true philosophers; they do all with
mildness and with gentleness. “And when they heard that, we read, with
one accord they lifted up their voice to God.” ([Acts
4.24](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#024)<span id="vi.xi-p11.4"></span>..md)
That shout proceeded from delight and great emotion. Such indeed are the
prayers which do their work, prayers replete with true philosophy,
prayers offered up for such objects, by such persons, on such occasions,
in such a manner; whereas all others are abominable and profane. “Lord,
Thou the God that madest heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them
is.” Observe how they say nothing idle, no old wives’ talk and fables,
but speak of His power. Just as Christ Himself said to the Jews, “If I
by the Spirit of God do cast out devils:” behold the Father also speaks
by the Spirit. For what saith it? “Lord, the God Who, <span
id="fr_276"></span>[277](#fn_276.md) by the Holy Ghost, through the mouth
of our father Thy servant David didst say, Why did the nations rage?”
([Acts 4.25](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#025.md)<span
id="vi.xi-p12.16"></span>.) Scripture is wont thus to speak of one as of
many. “For of a truth, Lord, against Thy Holy Child Jesus, Whom Thou
didst anoint, <span id="fr_277"></span>[278](#fn_277.md) both Herod and
Pontius Pilate,” etc. ([Acts 4.27](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#027.md)<span
id="vi.xi-p13.9"></span>.) Observe how, even in prayer, they
circumstantially describe the Passion, and refer all to God.—That is,
Not they had power to do this: but Thou didst it all, Thou <span
id="fr_278"></span>[279](#fn_278.md) that didst permit, that dost call to
account, and yet didst bring to accomplishment, Thou the All-skilful and
Wise, that didst serve Thee of Thine enemies for Thine own pleasure.
([Acts 4.28](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#028.md)<span
id="vi.xi-p14.6"></span>.) “For to do whatever Thy hand,” etc. Here they
discourse of His exceeding Skill and Wisdom and Power. So then, as
enemies they came together, and with murderous purpose, and as opposing
themselves, but they did what things Thou wouldest: “For to do,” as it
is said, “whatsoever Thy hand and Thy purpose determined before to be
done.” What means, “Thy hand?” Here he seems to me to denote <span
id="fr_279"></span>[280](#fn_279.md) one and the same thing by power and
purpose, meaning that for Thee it is enough but to will: for it is not
by power that one determines. “Whatsoever Thy hand,” etc. i.e.
Whatsoever Thou didst ordain: either this is the meaning, or, that by
His hand He did effect. “And now, Lord, regard their threatenings.”
([Acts 4.29](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#029.md)<span
id="vi.xi-p15.7"></span>.) As at that time, it is said, they “imagined
vain things,” so “now,” grant that their imaginations may be in vain:
i.e. let not their threatenings come into accomplishment. And this they
said not because they would themselves deprecate any hardship, but for
the preaching’s sake. For they do not say, “and deliver us out of
dangers;” but what? “And grant unto Thy servants, that with all boldness
they may speak Thy word.” Thou Who didst bring to pass the former
designs, bring these also to accomplishment. Observe, <span
id="fr_280"></span>[281](#fn_280.md) how they affirm God to be the Author
of their confidence; and how they ask all for God’s sake, nothing for
their own glory or ambition. They promise for their own part, that they
will not be dismayed; but they pray that signs may be wrought “by
stretching forth Thy hand to heal, and that signs and wonders may be
done:” ([Acts 4.30](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#030.md)<span
id="vi.xi-p16.9"></span>) for without these, however great the zeal they
showed, they would be striving to no purpose. God assented to their
prayer, and manifested this, by shaking the place. For “when they had
prayed,” it is said, “the place was shaken.” ([Acts
4.31](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#031)<span id="vi.xi-p16.10"></span>..md)
And wherefore this was done, hear from the prophet, when he says, “He
looketh on the earth, and maketh it to tremble. (<span
id="vi.xi-p16.11"></span>[Ps. civ.
32](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#032)<span id="vi.xi-p16.12"></span>..md)
For by this He made it manifest that He is present to their prayers. And
again, another prophet saith, “The earth was shaken, and did tremble at
the presence of the Lord.” (<span id="vi.xi-p16.13"></span>[Ps. xviii.
7](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#007.md)<span id="vi.xi-p16.14"></span>;
lxviii, 8.) And God did this, both to make it more awful, and to lead
them on to a courageous trust. “And they were all filled with the Holy
Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness.” They <span
id="fr_281"></span>[282](#fn_281.md) gained increased boldness. As it was
the beginning (of their work), and they had besought a sensible sign for
their persuasion (<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xi-p17.3"></span>πρὸς
τὸ πεισθἥναι αὐτους</span>)—but after this we nowhere find the like
happening—therefore great was the encouragement they received. In fact,
they had no means of proving that He was risen, save by miraculous
signs. So that it was not only their own assurance (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xi-p17.4"></span>ἀ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xi-p17.5"></span>σφαλείαν</span>) that they
sought: but that they might not be put to shame, but that they might
speak with boldness. “The place was shaken,” and that made them all the
more unshaken. For this is sometimes a token of wrath, sometimes of
favor and providence, but on the present occasion, of wrath. For <span
id="fr_282"></span>[283](#fn_282.md) in those times it took place in an
unusual manner. Thus, at the Crucifixion, the earth was shaken: and the
Lord Himself says, “Then there shall be famines, and pestilences, and
earthquakes in divers places.” ([Matt. xxiv.
7](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#007)<span id="vi.xi-p18.5"></span>..md) But
then the wrath of which it was a sign was against the adversaries: as
for the disciples, it filled them with the Spirit. Observe, even the
Apostles, after the prayer, are “filled with the Holy Ghost.” “And <span
id="fr_283"></span>[284](#fn_283.md) the multitudes of them that believed,”
etc. ([Acts 4.32](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#032.md)<span
id="vi.xi-p19.4"></span>.) Great, you perceive, is the virtue of this
thing, seeing their was need of this (grace) even in that Company. For
this is the foundation of all that is good, this of which he now for the
second time makes mention, exhorting all men to the contempt of riches:
“Neither <span id="fr_284"></span>[285](#fn_284.md) said any of them that
aught of the things he possessed was his own,” “but they had all things
common.” For that this was in consequence not merely of the miraculous
signs, but of their own purpose, is manifest by the case of Sapphira and
Ananias. “And with great power gave the Apostles witness,” etc. ([Acts
4.33](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#033)<span id="vi.xi-p20.5"></span>..md)
Not in word, but with power the Apostles exhibited their testimony of
the Resurrection: just as Paul saith, “And my preaching was not with
persuasive words of human wisdom, but with manifestation of the Spirit
and of power.” And it is not merely, With power, but, “With great
power.” ([1 Cor. ii. 4](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#004.md)<span
id="vi.xi-p20.6"></span>.) “And great grace,” it says, “was upon them
all; for neither was there any among them that lacked.” ([Acts
4.34](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#034)<span id="vi.xi-p20.7"></span>..md)
This is why the grace (was upon them all,) for that “there was none that
lacked:” that is, from the exceeding ardor of the givers, none was in
want. For they did not give in part, and in part reserve: nor yet in
giving all, give it as their own. And they lived moreover in great
abundance: they removed all inequality from among them, and made a
goodly order. “For as many as were possessors,” etc. And with great
respect they did this: for they did not presume to give into their
hands, nor did they ostentatiously present, but brought to the Apostles’
feet. To them they left it to be the dispensers, made them the owners,
that thenceforth all should be defrayed as from common, not from
private, property. <span id="fr_285"></span>[286](#fn_285.md) This was also
a help to them against vain-glory. If this were done now, we should live
more pleasant lives, both rich and poor, nor would it be more pleasant
to the poor than to the rich themselves. And if you please, let us now
for awhile depict it in words, and derive at least this pleasure from
it, since you have no mind for it in your actions. For at any rate this
is evident, even from the facts which took place then, that by selling
their possessions they did not come to be in need, but made them rich
that were in need. However, let us now depict this state of things in
words, and let all sell their possessions, and bring them into the
common stock—in words, I mean: let none be excited, rich or poor. How
much gold think you would be collected? For my part, I conjecture—for of
course it is not possible to speak exactly—that supposing all here, men
and women, to empty out their whole property, lands, possessions,
houses,—for I will not speak of slaves, since at that time there was no
such thing, but doubtless such as were slaves they sat at
liberty,—perhaps ten hundred thousand pounds weight of gold would be the
amount collected: nay, twice or thrice as much. For consider; at what
number of “*juga*” <span id="fr_286"></span>[287](#fn_286) (yokes.md) is
our city rated? How many (of the population) shall we say are
Christians? shall we say an hundred thousand, and the rest Greeks and
Jews? Then what thousands (of pounds) of gold would be collected! And
what is the number of poor? I do not think more than fifty thousand.
Then to feed that number daily, what abundance there would be! And yet
if the food were received in common, all taking their meals together, it
would require no such great outlay after all. But, you will ask, what
should we do after the money was spent? And do you think it ever could
be spent? Would not the grace of God be ten thousand fold greater? Would
not the grace of God be indeed richly poured out? Nay, should we not
make it a heaven upon earth? If, where the numbers were three thousand
and five thousand, the doing of this thing had such splendid success,
and none of them complained of poverty, how much more glorious would
this be in so vast a multitude? And even of those that are without, who
would not contribute?—But, to show that it is the living separately that
is expensive and causes poverty, let there be a house in which are ten
children: and the wife and the man, let the one work at her wool, the
other bring his earnings from his outdoor occupation: now tell me, in
which way would these spend most? by taking their meals together and
occupying one house, or by living separately? Of course, by living
separately. For if the ten children must live apart, they would need ten
several rooms, ten tables, ten attendants, and the income otherwise in
proportion. Is it not for this very reason, that where there is a great
number of servants, they have all one table, that the expense may not be
so great? For so it is, division always makes diminution, concord and
agreement make increase. The dwellers in the monasteries live just as
the faithful did then: now did ever any of these die of hunger? was ever
any of them not provided for with plenty of everything? Now, it seems,
people are more afraid of this than of falling into a boundless and
bottomless deep. But if we had made actual trial of this, <span
id="fr_287"></span>[288](#fn_287.md) then indeed we should boldly venture
upon this plan (<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xi-p23.2"></span>τοὕ
πράγματος</span>). What grace too, think you, would there not be! For if
at that time, when there was no believer but only the three thousand and
the five thousand: when all, throughout the world, were enemies, when
they could nowhere look for comfort, they yet boldly entered upon this
plan with such success; how much more would this be the case now, when
by the grace of God there are believers everywhere throughout the world?
What Gentile would be left? For my part, I think there would not be one:
we should so attract all, and draw them to us? But yet if we do but
make <span id="fr_288"></span>[289](#fn_288.md) fair progress, I trust in
God that even this shall be realized. Only do as I say, and let us
successfully achieve things in their regular order; if God grant life, I
trust that we shall soon bring you over to this way of life.

<span id="vi.xi-p25"></span>In the first place, as regards that law
about swearing: accomplish that; establish it firmly: and let him that
has kept it make known him that has not, and call him to account withal
and rebuke him sternly. For the (*supra,* Hom. viii.) appointed time
(<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xi-p25.1"></span>ἡ</span> <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xi-p25.2"></span>προθεσμία</span>), is at
hand and I am holding inquisition in the matter, and him that is found
guilty I will banish and exclude. But God forbid that any such should be
found among us; rather may it appear, that all have strictly kept this
spiritual watchword. And as in war it is by the watchword that friends
and strangers are shown, so let it be now; for indeed now also we are
engaged in a war; that we may know our brethren that are properly such.
For what a good thing it is that we should have this to be our
cognizance both here and in a foreign land! What a weapon this, against
the very head of the devil! A mouth that cannot swear will soon both
engage God in prayers, and smite the devil a deadly blow. A mouth that
cannot swear will also be incapable of using insulting language. Cast
out this fire from your tongue, as you would from a house: this fire,
drag it out. Give your tongue a little rest: make the sore less
virulent. Yea, I beseech you, do this, that I may go on to set you
another lesson: for as long as this is not rightly done, I dare not pass
on to any other. Let this lesson be got perfectly, and you shall have a
consciousness of the achievement, and then I will introduce you to other
laws, or rather not I, but Christ. Implant in your soul this good thing,
and by little and little ye shall be a paradise of God, far better than
that paradise of old. No serpent among you, no deadly tree, nor any such
thing. Fix this habit deep. If this be done, not ye only that are
present shall be benefitted, but all that are in all the world; and not
they alone, but those that are to succeed hereafter. For a good habit
having once entered, and being kept by all, will be handed on to long
ages, and no circumstances shall be able to erase it. If he that
gathered sticks on the sabbath was stoned,—the man that is doing a far
more heinous work than that gathering, the man that is amassing a load
of sins, for such is the multitude of oaths, what shall he undergo? what
shall he not have to endure? You will receive great assistance from God,
if this be well achieved by you. If I were to say, Be not abusive,
immediately you will plead to me your indignation; should I say, Be not
envious, you will urge some other excuse. But in this case you have
nothing of the kind to say. On which account I began with the easy
precepts, which indeed is also the uniform practice in all arts. And
thus one comes to the higher duties, by learning first those which are
easier far. How easy it is you will see, when by the grace of God having
succeeded in this, you shall receive another precept.

<span id="vi.xi-p26"></span>Put it in my power to speak out boldly, in
the presence both of Gentiles and of Jews, and, above all, of God. Yea,
I entreat you by the love, by the pangs wherewith I have travailed for
your birth, “my little children.” I will not add what follows, “of whom
I travail in birth again;” nor will I say, “until Christ be formed in
you.” (<span id="vi.xi-p26.1"></span>[Gal. iv.
19](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#019)<span id="vi.xi-p26.2"></span>.md). For
I am persuaded, that Christ has been formed in you. Other language I
will use towards you; “My brethren, dearly beloved and longed for, my
joy and my crown.” ([Phil. iv. 1](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#001.md)<span
id="vi.xi-p26.3"></span>.) Believe me that I shall use no other
language. If at this moment there were placed upon my head ten thousand
richly-jewelled royal crowns, they could not give me the joy which I
feel at your growth in holiness; or rather, I do not think the monarch
himself has such a joy, as that wherewith I joy over you. Let him have
come home, victorious over all the nations at war with him, let him have
won many other crowns besides the crown of his right; and receive other
diadems as tokens of his victory: I do not think he would joy over his
trophies, as I joy over your soul’s progress. For I exult, as if I had a
thousand crowns on my head; and well may I rejoice. For if by the grace
of God you achieve this good habit, you will have gained a thousand
battles far more difficult than his; by wrestling and fighting with
malicious demons, and fiendish spirits, with the tongue, not with sword,
but by the will. For consider how much is gained, if so be that you do
succeed! You have eradicated, first, a heinous habit; secondly, an evil
conceit, the source of all evil, namely, the opinion that the thing is
indifferent and can do no hurt; thirdly, wrath; fourthly, covetousness;
for all these are the offspring of swearing. Nay, hence you will acquire
a sure footing in the way to all other virtues. For as when children
learn their letters, they learn not them alone, but by means of them are
gradually taught to read; so shall it be with you. That evil conceit
will no longer deceive you, you will not say, This is indifferent; you
will no longer speak by mere habit, but will manfully stand against all,
so that having perfected in all parts that virtue which is after God,
you may reap eternal blessings, through the grace and loving-kindness of
His Only-Begotten Son, to Whom with the Father and the Holy Ghost be
glory, power and honor, now and ever, world without end. Amen.

“will” here make one notion, “Thy will which is also power,” for to Thee
to will is to prevail: not two notions, for we do not say that power
determines, but only the will.—The Edd. however, adopt from E. <span

<span id="fn_285"></span>[i:286](1110016.htm#fr_285.md) <span
id="vi.xi-p20.8"></span>

<span id="vi.xi-p21"></span> The strong expressions of Chrys. concerning
the community of goods at Jerusalem are quite different from the guarded
and limiting statements of most modern commentators who seem bent upon
showing that it was only a case of remarkable liberality, e.g. Hackett
*in loco:* “Common in the use of their property, not necessarily in
their possession of it.” Our author’s statements agree better with the
New Test. notices on the subject. The main facts are these. (1) There
was a real and general community of property. The statements in Acts on
this point are clear and strong: <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xi-p21.1"></span>καὶ εἶχον ἅπαντα κοινά</span> ([Acts
2.44](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#044)<span id="vi.xi-p21.2"></span>.md);
They were selling and distributing their real and personal
property—<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xi-p21.3"></span>τὰ κτήματα
καὶ τὰς ὑπάρξεις</span> (ii. 45). Nor did any one say that anything of
his possessions was his own, <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xi-p21.4"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xi-p21.5"></span>λλ ἦν αὐτοῖς ἅπαντα κοινά</span>, ([Acts
4.32](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#032)<span id="vi.xi-p21.6"></span>.md);
“As many as (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xi-p21.7"></span>ὅ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xi-p21.8"></span>σοι</span>) were possessors of lands or houses,”
sold them, brought the money and distribution was made to the needs of
each ([Acts 4:34](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#034.md),
[35](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#035)<span id="vi.xi-p21.9"></span>.md).
This is more than distinguished liberality or mere prevailing
willingness to give. (2) This peculiar phenomenon was connected with the
habit of living together as a group or family, on the part of the
Jerusalem Christians ([Acts 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#013.md),
[Acts 2:42](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#042.md)<span
id="vi.xi-p21.10"></span>). It was an evidence that they were peculiarly
one in heart and soul, that no member of this closely-knit community was
allowed to suffer while others could supply him ([Acts
4.32-34](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#032.md)<span
id="vi.xi-p21.11"></span>). (3) The arrangement was purely voluntary.
There was no law or demand in the case. Ananias and Sapphira ([Acts
5.1-11](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#001)<span id="vi.xi-p21.12"></span>.md)
were not punished for contributing to the common treasury only a part of
the price of the land but as [Acts
5.4](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#004.md)<span id="vi.xi-p21.13"></span>
clearly shows, for falsely presenting it *as the whole.* Yet the fact
that they wished to have it thought that they had brought all seems to
show that to bring all was customary and expected. (4) This community of
goods was both local and temporary. It seems to have been confined to
Jerusalem. There is no allusion to it in the Epistles. It sprang out of
the ardor of brotherly love in the early years of the Christian
community at Jerusalem and in view of the special needs of many of its
members. The special poverty of the church at Jerusalem which made
contributions from other churches necessary, may have resulted in part,
as Meyer suggests, from the working of this plan. (5) The custom can
hardly be explained apart from the expectation of the nearness of the
*Parousia.* In the Thessalonian church all labor for self-support was
upon the point of ceasing for the same reason. [1 Thess.

id="vi.xi-p22.11"></span>συντελεῖ</span>. The meaning is, At what number
of *juga* is our city assessed to the imperial tributes? Justinian
*Novell.* xvii. c. 8. prescribes that the imperial <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xi-p22.12"></span>πράκτορες</span>,
*exactores,* shall be compelled to insert in their returns (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xi-p22.13"></span>ἀ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xi-p22.14"></span>ποχαί</span>) the exact
quantity “of *zygocephala* or *juga* or *jugalia* or whatever else be
the term used in different localities:” <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xi-p22.15"></span>τὸ πόσον τῶν ζυγοκεφάλων ἢ ἰο ύγων ἢ ἰουγαλίων,
ἢ ὅπως δήποτε ἂν αὐτὰ κατὰ χῶραν καλοῖεν</span>. See Du Fresne *Gloss.*
s. vv. It seems that each holding of land was rated or assessed at so
many *juga* or yokes of oxen; moreover the term *jugum* is equivalent to
a measure of land, as Varro remarks that land is measured in some places
by *juga,* in others by *jugera.*
