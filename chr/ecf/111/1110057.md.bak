<span id="vi.lii-p1"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vi.lii-p1.1"></span>Homily LII.</span>

<span id="vi.lii-p2"></span>[Acts XXV.
23](../../../bib/kjv/act025.htm#023.md)<span id="vi.lii-p2.1"></span>

<span id="vi.lii-p3"></span>"And on the morrow, when Agrippa was come,
and Bernice with great pomp, and was entered into the place of hearing,
with the chief captains, and principal men of the city, at Festus’
commandment Paul was brought forth.”

<span id="vi.lii-p4"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="vi.lii-p4.1"></span>See</span> what an audience is gathered together
for Paul. Having collected all his guards, the governor is come, and the
king, and the tribunes, “with the principal men,” it says, “of the
city.” Then Paul being brought forth, see how he is proclaimed as
conqueror. Festus himself acquits him from the charges, for what says
Festus? “And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men which are here
present with us, ye see this man, about whom all the multitude of the
Jews have dealt with me, both at Jerusalem, and also here, crying that
he ought not to live any longer. But when I found that he had committed
nothing worthy of death, and that he himself hath appealed to Augustus,
I have determined to send him. Of whom I have no certain thing to write
unto my lord. Wherefore I have brought him forth before you, and
especially before thee, O king Agrippa, that, after examination had, I
might have somewhat to write. For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send
a prisoner, and not withal to signify the crimes laid against him.”
([Acts 25.24-27](../../../bib/kjv/act025.htm#024.md)<span
id="vi.lii-p4.2"></span>.) Mark how he accuses them, while he acquits
him. O what an abundance of justifications! After all these repeated
examinations, the governor finds not how he may condemn him. They said
he was worthy of death. On this account he said also: “When I found,”
says he “that he had committed nothing worthy of death.—Of whom I have
no certain thing to write to my lord.” This too is a proof of Paul’s
spotlessness, that the judge found nothing to say concerning him.
“Therefore I have brought him forth,” he says, “before you. For it
seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not withal to signify
the crime laid against him.” Such were the great straits into which the
Jews brought themselves and their rulers! What then? “Agrippa said to
Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for thyself.” ([Acts
26.1](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#001)<span id="vi.lii-p4.3"></span>..md)
From his great desire to hear, the king permits him to speak. But Paul
speaks out forthwith with boldness, not flattering, but for this reason
saying that he is happy, namely, because (Agrippa) knew all. “Then Paul
stretched forth the hand, and answered for himself. I think myself
happy, king Agrippa, because I shall answer for myself this day before
thee touching all the things whereof I am accused of the Jews.
Especially because I know thee to be expert in all questions which are
among the Jews: wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently.” ([Acts
26:2](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#002.md),
[3](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#003)<span id="vi.lii-p4.4"></span>..md) And
yet, had he been conscious of guilt, he should have feared at being
tried in the presence of one who knew all the facts: but this is a mark
of a clear conscience, not to shrink from a judge who has an accurate
knowledge of the circumstances, but even to rejoice, and to call himself
happy. “I beseech thee,” he says, “to hear me patiently.” Since he is
about to lengthen out his speech, and to say something about himself, on
this account, he premises an entreaty, and (then) says: “My manner of
life from my youth, which was at the first among mine own nation at
Jerusalem, know all the Jews: which knew me from the beginning, if they
would testify, that after the most straitest sect of our religion I
lived a Pharisee.” ([Acts 26:4](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#004.md),
[5](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#005)<span id="vi.lii-p4.5"></span>..md)
Then how should I have become a seditious person, who when young was
(thus) testified of by all? Then too from his sect: “after the most
straitest sect” says he, “of our religion I lived.” “What then, if
though the sect indeed be worthy of admiration, thou art evil?” Touching
this also I call all to witness—touching my life and conversation. “And
now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God unto
our fathers: unto which promise our twelve tribes, instantly serving God
day and night, hope to come. For which hope’s sake, king Agrippa, I am
accused of the Jews. Why should it be thought a thing incredible with
you, that God should raise the dead?” ([Acts
26.6-8](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#006)<span id="vi.lii-p4.6"></span>..md)
Two arguments he lays down for the Resurrection: one, the argument from
the prophets: and he does not bring forward any prophet (in particular,)
but the doctrine itself as held by the Jews: the other and stronger one,
the argument from the facts—(especially from this,) that Christ Himself
held discourse with him. And he lays the ground for this by (other)
arguments, relating accurately his former madness. Then too, with high
commendation of the Jews, he says, “Night and day,” says he, “serving
(God) look to attain unto.” So that even if I had not been of
unblemished life, it is not for this (doctrine) that I ought to be
brought to trial:—“for which hope, king Agrippa, I am accused of the
Jews.” And then another argument “Why should it be thought a thing
incredible with you, that God should raise the dead?” Since, if such an
opinion had not existed, if they had not been brought up in these
dogmas, but they were now for the first time brought in, perhaps <span
id="fr_1137"></span>[1138](#fn_1137.md) some one might not have received
the saying. Then he tells, how he persecuted: this also helps the proof:
and he brings forward the chief priests as witnesses, and the “strange
cities,” and that he heard Him saying to him, “It is hard for thee to
kick against the pricks,” and shows the mercifulness of God, that,
though being persecuted He appeared (to men), and did that benefit not
to me only, but also sent me as teacher to others: and shows also the
prophecy, now come to pass, which he then heard, “Delivering thee from
the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom I send thee.” Showing all
this, he says: “I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many
things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth. Which thing I also did
in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having
received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to
death, I gave my voice against them. And I punished them oft in every
synagogue, and compelled them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad
against them, I persecuted them even unto strange cities. Whereupon as I
went to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests,
at midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the
brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them which journeyed
with me. And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice
speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why
persecutest thou Me? it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks. And
I said, Who art Thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom thou
persecutest; but rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto
thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of
these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I
will appear unto thee: delivering thee from the people, and from the
Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee, to open their eyes, and to turn
them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that
they may receive forgiveness of sins ([Acts
26.9-18](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#009.md)<span
id="vi.lii-p5.3"></span>):—observe <span
id="fr_1138"></span>[1139](#fn_1138.md) how mildly he discourses—God, he
says, said (this) to me, “that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and
inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in Me.” By
these things, says he, I was persuaded, by this vision He drew me to
Himself, and so persuaded me, that I made no delay. “Whereupon, O king
Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision: but showed
first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the
coasts of Judea, and then to the Gentiles, that they should repent and
turn to God, and do works meet for repentance.” ([Acts
26:19](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#019.md),
[20](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#020)<span id="vi.lii-p6.5"></span>..md) I
therefore, who instructed others also concerning the most excellent way
of living, how should I myself have become the author of sedition and
contention? “For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went
about to kill me. Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto
this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things
than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come.” ([Acts
26:21](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#021.md),
[22](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#022)<span id="vi.lii-p6.6"></span>..md)
See how free from flattery his speech is, and how he ascribes the whole
to God. Then his boldness—but neither do I now desist: and the sure
grounds—for it is from the prophets that I urge the question, “Whether
the Christ was to suffer:” then <span
id="fr_1139"></span>[1140](#fn_1139.md) the Resurrection and the promise,
“Whether He, as the first to rise from the dead, should show light unto
the people and to the Gentiles.” ([Acts
26.23](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#023)<span id="vi.lii-p7.3"></span>..md)
Festus saw the boldness, and what says he? For Paul was all along
addressing himself to the king—he was in a manner annoyed, <span
id="fr_1140"></span>[1141](#fn_1140.md) and says to him, “Thou art beside
thyself, Paul:” for, “while he thus discoursed, Festus said with a loud
voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself: much learning doth make thee mad.”
([Acts 26.24](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#024.md)<span
id="vi.lii-p8.4"></span>.) What then says Paul? With gentleness, “I am
not mad,” says he, “most noble Festus; but speak forth the words of
truth and soberness.” ([Acts
26.25](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#025)<span id="vi.lii-p8.5"></span>..md)
Then too he gives him to understand why, turning from him, he addressed
his speech to the king: “For the king knoweth of these things, before
whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things
are hidden from him: for this thing was not done in a corner.” ([Acts
26.26](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#026)<span id="vi.lii-p8.6"></span>..md)
He shows, that (the king) knows all perfectly; at the same time, all but
saying to the Jews, And ye indeed ought to have known these things—for
this is the meaning of that which he adds, “For this thing was not done
in a corner. And Agrippa, said to Paul, <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.lii-p8.7"></span>᾽</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.lii-p8.8"></span>Εν ὀλίγῳ</span> thou persuadest me to be a
Christian.” What is <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.lii-p8.9"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.lii-p8.10"></span>ν ὀλίγῳ</span>? <span
id="fr_1141"></span>[1142](#fn_1141.md) “Within a little, <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.lii-p9.23"></span>παρὰ μικρόν</span>. “And
Paul said, I could pray to God,” <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.lii-p9.24"></span>καὶ ἐν ὀλίγῳ καὶ ἐν πολλᾥ</span>, (that is) “I
could pray to God,” for my part, not “in little” (but “in much”): he
does not simply pray, he prays (not briefly, but) with largeness—“that
not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were such as I
am.” <span id="fr_1142"></span>[1143](#fn_1142.md) Then he adds, “except
these bonds;” and yet it was matter of glory; true, but looking to their
notion of it, therefore says he, “except these bonds.” ([Acts
26.27-29](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#027.md)<span
id="vi.lii-p10.25"></span>.)

<span id="vi.lii-p11"></span>(Recapitulation.) “And on the morrow,” etc.
([Acts 25.23](../../../bib/kjv/act025.htm#023.md)<span
id="vi.lii-p11.1"></span>.) The Jews desisted ever since Paul exercised
his right of appeal. <span id="fr_1143"></span>[1144](#fn_1143.md) Then
also for him the theatre becomes a splendid one: “with great pomp” they
were present. “And Festus said,” etc. “The whole multitude of the
Jews—“not some of them only, and others not so—“both at Jerusalem, and
also here,” they said “that he ought not to live any longer.” ([Acts
25.24](../../../bib/kjv/act025.htm#024.md)<span
id="vi.lii-p12.22"></span>.) “And I having found,” etc. It shows that he
did right in appealing to Cæsar. For if <span
id="fr_1144"></span>[1145](#fn_1144.md) though they had no great matter to
allege against him, yet those (at Jerusalem) were mad against him, with
good reason may he go to Cæsar. “That after examination had by you,” he
says, “I may get somewhat to write.” Observe how the matter is
repeatedly put to the test. The Jews therefore may thank themselves for
this vindication <span id="fr_1145"></span>[1146](#fn_1145) (of Paul.md),
which would come to the ears of those also who were at Rome. See how
they become the unwilling heralds both of their own wickedness and of
Paul’s virtue, even to the emperor himself: so that Paul was carried
away (to Rome) with more renown than if he had gone thither without
bonds: for not as an impostor and a deceiver, after so many judges had
acquitted him, was he now carried thither. Quit therefore of all
charges, <span id="fr_1146"></span>[1147](#fn_1146.md) among those with
whom he was bred and born, and not only so, (but) thus free from all
suspicion, he makes his appearance at Rome. “Then Paul,” etc. ([Acts
26.1-3](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#001.md)<span
id="vi.lii-p15.7"></span>.) And he said not, Why is this? once for all I
have appealed to Cæsar: I have been tried many times: when will there be
an end of this? but what did he? Again he is ready to render an account,
and that, before the man who was the best informed on the subject; and
with much boldness, seeing they were not his judges to condemn him: but
still, though they were not his judges, since that declaration was in
force, “Unto Cæsar shalt thou go, he renders an account and gives full
answers, “touching all the things,” and not merely on one and another
here and there. They accuse me of sedition, accuse me of heresy, accuse
me that I have profaned the temple: “touching all these things I answer
for myself:” now that these are not things in accordance with my ways,
my accusers themselves are witnesses: “my manner of life from my youth,”
etc. ([Acts 26.4](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#004.md)<span
id="vi.lii-p15.8"></span>.) which is what he says on a former occasion
“Being a zealot.” ([Acts 22.3](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#003.md)<span
id="vi.lii-p15.9"></span>.) And when the whole people was present, then
he challenges their testimony: not <span
id="fr_1147"></span>[1148](#fn_1147.md) before the tribunal, but before
Lysias, and again here, when more were present: whereas in that hearing
there needed not much vindication of himself, since Lysias’ letter
exculpated him. “Know all the Jews,” he says, “which knew me from the
beginning.” And he does not say what kind of life his was, but leaves it
to their own conscience, and lays the whole stress on his *sect*, as he
would not have chosen that sect, if he had been a man of evil
disposition and bad character (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.lii-p16.6"></span>πονηρὸς καὶ μοχθηρός</span>). “But, for this
hope” (<span class="c14"><span id="vi.lii-p16.7"></span>mss</span>. and
Edd. <span class="Greek"><span id="vi.lii-p16.8"></span>αἱρέσεως</span>)
he says, “I stand and am judged.” ([Acts
26:6](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#006.md),
[7](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#007)<span id="vi.lii-p16.9"></span>..md)
This hope is honored among themselves also, because of this they pray,
because of this they worship, that unto this they may attain: this same
do I show forth. Why then, it is acting like madmen, to be doing all
things for the sake of attaining to this, and yet to persecute him who
believes in the same. “I indeed thought with myself,” that is, I
determined, “to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of
Nazareth.” ([Acts 26.9](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#009.md)<span
id="vi.lii-p16.10"></span>.) I was not one of Christ’s disciples: among
those who fought against Him, was I. Whence also he is a witness who has
a right to be believed, because he, a man who was doing numberless
things, makes war on the believers, persuading them to blaspheme,
stirring up all against them, cities, rulers, and by himself doing all
this of his own accord, was thus suddenly changed. Then again the
witnesses, those who were with him: next he shows what just cause he had
to be persuaded, both from the light, and from the prophets, and from
the results, and from the things which have now taken place. See
accordingly, how both from the prophets, and from these particulars, he
confirms the proof to them. For that he may not seem to be broaching
some novelty, although he had great things to say, yet he again takes
refuge with the prophets, and puts this as a question for
discussion. <span id="fr_1148"></span>[1149](#fn_1148.md) Now this had a
stronger claim upon belief, as having actually come to pass: but since
he alone saw (Christ), he again fetches proof of it from the prophets.
And see how he does not discourse alike in the court of justice, and in
the assembly (of his own people); there indeed he says, “ye slew Him:”
but here no such thing, that he might not kindle their anger more: but
he shows the same thing, by saying, “Whether the Christ was to suffer.”
He so frees them from accusations: for the prophets, he says, say this.
Therefore receive ye also the rest. Since he has mentioned the vision,
he then without fear goes on to speak also of the good wrought by it.
“To turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto
God. For to this end have I appeared unto thee” ([Acts
26.16-18](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#016.md)<span
id="vi.lii-p17.3"></span>), not to punish, but to make thee an Apostle.
He shows the evils which possess unbelievers, “Satan, darkness;” the
good things belonging to believers, light, God, “the inheritance of the
saints. Whereupon, O king Agrippa,” etc. ([Acts
26:19](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#019.md),
[20](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#020)<span id="vi.lii-p17.4"></span>..md)
He not only exhorts them to repent, but also to show forth a life worthy
of admiration. And see how everywhere the Gentiles are admitted into
connection with the people (Israel): for those who were present were of
the Gentiles. “Testifying,” he says, “both to great and small,” ([Acts
26.22](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#022)<span id="vi.lii-p17.5"></span>.md)
that is, both to distinguished and undistinguished. This is also for the
soldiers. Observe: having left the post of defendant, he took up that of
teacher—and therefore also it is that Festus says to him, “Thou art
beside thyself”—but then, that he may not seem to be himself the
teacher, he brings in the prophets, and Moses: “Whether the Christ was
to suffer, whether He as the first to rise from the dead should show
light both to the people, and to the Gentiles.” ([Acts
26.23](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#023)<span id="vi.lii-p17.6"></span>..md)
“And Festus said with a loud voice”—in such anger and displeasure (did
he speak)—“Paul, thou art beside thyself.” What then said Paul? “I am
not mad,” etc. “For this thing,” he says, “was not done in a corner.”
([Acts 26:25](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#025.md),
[26](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#026)<span id="vi.lii-p17.7"></span>..md)
Here he speaks of the Cross, of the Resurrection: that the doctrine was
come to every part of the world. “King Agrippa,” he says, “believest
thou”—he does not say, the Resurrection, but—“the prophets?” ([Acts
26.27](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#027)<span id="vi.lii-p17.8"></span>..md)
Then he forestalls him, and says: “I know that thou believest.” <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.lii-p17.9"></span>᾽</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.lii-p17.10"></span>Εν ὀλίγῳ</span> (i.e.
within a little,) “almost thou persuadeth the to be a Christian.” ([Acts
26.28](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#028.md)<span
id="vi.lii-p17.11"></span>.) Paul did not understand what the phrase
<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.lii-p17.12"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.lii-p17.13"></span>ν ὀλίγῳ</span> meant: he
thought it meant <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.lii-p17.14"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.lii-p17.15"></span>ξ ὀλιγου</span> (i.e. with little cost or
trouble), wherefore also he answers (as) to this: so unlearned was
he. <span id="fr_1149"></span>[1150](#fn_1149.md) And he said not, I do not
wish (that), but, “I pray that not only thou, but also all that hear.”
Mark how free from flattery his speech is.—“I pray that this day they
may be all such as I am, except these bonds.” ([Acts
26.29](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#029.md)<span
id="vi.lii-p18.12"></span>.) He, the man that glories in his bonds, that
puts them forth as a golden chain, deprecates them for these men: for
they were as yet too weak in their minds, and it was rather in
condescension that he so spake. For what could be better than those
bonds which always in his Epistles he prefers (to all things else),
saying, “Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ:” (<span
id="vi.lii-p18.13"></span>[Eph. iii.
1](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#001)<span id="vi.lii-p18.14"></span>.md) and
again, “On this account I am bound with this chain” (<span
id="vi.lii-p18.15"></span>[Acts xxviii.
20](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#020)<span id="vi.lii-p18.16"></span>.md),
“but the word of God is not bound;” and, “Even unto bonds, as an
evil-doer.” ([2 Tim. ii. 9](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#009.md)<span
id="vi.lii-p18.17"></span>.) The punishment was twofold. For if indeed
he had been so bound, as with a view to his good, the thing would have
carried with it some consolation: but now (he is bound) both “as an
evil-doer,” and as with a view to very ill consequences; yet for none of
these things cared he. <span id="fr_1150"></span>[1151](#fn_1150.md)

<span id="vi.lii-p20"></span>Such is a soul winged with heavenly love.
For if those who cherish the foul (earthly passion which men call) love,
think nothing either glorious of precious, but those things alone which
tend to gratify their lust, they think both glorious and honorable, and
their mistress is everything to them; much more do those, who have been
taken captive by this heavenly love, think nothing of the cost (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.lii-p20.1"></span>τὰ ἐπιτίμια</span>). But if
we do not understand what I am saying, it is no marvel, while we are
unskilled in this Divine Wisdom. For if any one be caught with the fire
of Christ’s love, he becomes such as a man would become who dwelt alone
upon the earth, so utterly careless is he for glory or disgrace: but
just as if he dwelt alone, he would care for nothing, no more does he in
this case. As for trials, he so despises them, both scourges and
imprisonments, as though the body in which he suffers these things were
another’s and not his own, or as though he had got a body made of
adamant: while as for the sweet things of this life, he so laughs them
to scorn, is so insensible to them, as we are insensible of dead bodies,
being ourselves dead. He is as far from being taken captive by any
passion, as the gold refined in the fire and purified is free from
alloy. For even as flies would not dart into the midst of a flame, but
fly from it, so the passions dare not even to come near this man. Would
that I could bring forward examples of all this from among ourselves:
but since we are at a loss for such, we must needs betake ourselves to
this same Paul. Observe him then, how he felt towards the whole world.
“The world is crucified unto me,” he says, “and I unto the world” ([Gal.
vi. 14](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#014.md)<span
id="vi.lii-p20.2"></span>): I am dead to the world, and the world is
dead to me. And again: “It is no longer I that live, but Christ liveth
in me.” <span id="fr_1151"></span>[1152](#fn_1151.md) (ib. [Gal. ii.
20](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#020)<span id="vi.lii-p21.1"></span>..md)
And, to show you that he was as it were in solitude, and so looked upon
the things present, hear himself saying, “While we look not at the
things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen.” (<span
id="vi.lii-p21.2"></span>[2 Cor. iv.
18](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#018)<span id="vi.lii-p21.3"></span>..md)
What sayest thou? Answer me. And yet what thou sayest is the contrary;
thou seest the things invisible, and the visible thou seest not. Such
eyes as thou hadst gotten, such are the eyes which are given by Christ:
for as these bodily eyes see indeed the things that are seen, but things
unseen they see not: so those (heavenly eyes) do the contrary: none that
beholds the invisible things, beholds the visible: no one beholding the
things seen, beholds the invisible. Or is not this the case with us
also? For when having turned our mind inwards we think of any of the
unseen things, our views become raised above the things on earth. <span
id="fr_1152"></span>[1153](#fn_1152.md) Let us despise glory: let us be
willing to be laughed at rather than to be praised. For he indeed who is
laughed at is nothing hurt: but he who is praised is much hurt. Let us
not think much of those things which terrify men, but as we do in the
case of children, this let us do here: namely, if we see any one
terrifying children, we do not hold that man in admiration: since in
fact whoever does frighten, only frightens children; for were it a man,
he could not frighten him. Just as those who frighten (children in
sport), do this either by drawing up their eyelids, or by otherwise
distorting their face, but with the eye looking naturally and mild they
would not be able to do this: so these others do this, by distorting
their mental vision (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.lii-p22.3"></span>τὸ διορατικὸν τἥς διανοίας</span>). So that of
a mild man and beautiful in soul nobody would be afraid; on the
contrary, we all respect him, honor and venerate him. See ye not, how
the man who causes terror is also an object of hatred and abhorrence to
us all? For of those things which are only able to terrify what do we
not turn away from? Is it not so with wild beasts, with sounds, with
sights, with places, with the air, such as darkness? Let us not
therefore think it a great thing, if men fear us. For, in the first
place, no man indeed is frightened at us: and, secondly, it is no great
thing (if they were). Virtue is a great good: and see how great. However
wretched we may deem the things by means of which it consists, yet we
admire virtue itself, and count them blessed (that have it). For who
would not count the patient sufferer blessed, although poverty and such
like things seem to be wretched? When therefore it shines forth through
those things which seem to be wretched, see how surpassingly great this
is! Thinkest thou much, O man, because thou art in power? And what sort
of power? say, was it conferred by appointment? (If so,) of men thou
hast received power: appoint thyself to it from within. For the ruler is
not he who is so called, but he who is really so. For as a king could
not make a physician or an orator, so neither can he make a ruler: since
it is not the (imperial) letters nor the name that makes a ruler. For,
if you will, let any man build a medicine-shop, let him also have
pupils, let him have instruments too and drugs, and let him visit those
who are sick: are these things sufficient to make a physician? By no
means: but there is need of art, and without that, not only do these
things profit nothing, but they even hurt: since it were better that he
who is not a physician should not even possess medicines. He that
possesses them not, neither saves nor destroys: but he that possesses
them, destroys, if he knows not how to use them: since the healing power
is not only in the nature of the medicines, but also in the art of the
person applying them: where this is not, all is marred. Such also is the
ruler: he has for instruments, his voice, anger, executioners,
banishments, honors, gifts, and praises; he has also for medicines, the
law; has also for his patients, men; for a place to practise in, the
court of justice; for pupils, he has the soldiers: if then he know not
the science of healing, all these profit him nothing. The judge is a
physician of souls, not of bodies: but if this art of healing the bodies
needs so much care, much more that of healing the soul, since the soul
is of more importance than the body. Then not the mere having the name
of ruler is to be a ruler: since others also are called by great names:
as Paul, Peter, James, and John: but the names do not make them that
which they are called, as neither does my name make me (to be that which
John was); I bear indeed the same name with that blessed man, but I am
not the same thing (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.lii-p22.4"></span>ὁ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.lii-p22.5"></span>μώνυμος</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.lii-p22.6"></span>,</span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.lii-p22.7"></span>οὐ μὴν συνώνυμος</span>), I am not John, but am
called so. In the same way they are not rulers, but are called so. But
those others are rulers even without these adjuncts, just as also a
physician, though he may not actually practise his science, yet if he
have it in his soul, he is a physician. Those are rulers, who bear rule
over themselves. For there are these four things, <span
id="fr_1153"></span>[1154](#fn_1153.md) soul, family; city, world: and the
things form a regular progression (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.lii-p23.7"></span>ὁ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.lii-p23.8"></span>δᾥ προβαίνει</span>). He therefore that is to
superintend a family, and order it well, must first bring his own soul
into order; for it is his family: but if he cannot order his own family,
where there is but one soul, where he himself is master, where he is
always along with himself, how shall he order others? He that is able to
regulate his own soul, and makes the one part to rule, the other to be
subject, this man will be able to regulate a family also: but he that
can do this by a family, can do it by a city also: and if by a city,
then also by the world. But if he cannot do this for his own soul, how
then shall he be able to do it for the world? These things have been
spoken by me, that we may not be excited about offices of rule; that we
may know what ruling is: for this (which is so called) is not ruling,
but a there object of derision, mere slavery, and many other names one
might call it by. Tell me, what is proper to a ruler? is it not to help
one’s subjects, and to do them good? What then, if this be not the case?
how shall he help others, who has not helped himself? he who has
numberless tyrannies of the passions in his own soul, how shall he root
out those of others? Again, with respect to “luxury” or delightful
living: the true luxury or delight is not this (which is so called), but
quite another thing. For as we have shown that the ruler is not he who
is so called, but another (who has something more than the name), so the
person who lives indeed in delight is another sort of person (than he
whom we so describe). For “luxury” or delightful living seems indeed to
be, the enjoying pleasure and the gratifying the belly: yet it is not
this thing, but the contrary: it is, to have a soul worthy of
admiration, and to be in a state of pleasure. For let there be a man
eating, drinking, and wantoning; then let him suffer cares and loss of
spirits: can this man be said to be in a state of delight? Therefore, it
is not eating and drinking, it is the being in pleasure, that makes true
luxury or delightful living. Let there be a man who gets only dry bread,
and let him be filled with gladness: is not this pleasure? Well then, it
is the true luxury. Let us see then, to whom this befalls—whether to the
rich, or to those who are not rich? Neither to the one part altogether,
nor to the other, but to those who so order their own souls, that they
may not have many grounds for sorrows. And where is such a life as this
to be found? for I see you all eager and wishing to hear what this life
is which has no sorrows. Well then, let this be acknowledged first by
you, that this is pleasure, this the true luxury, to have no sorrow to
cause annoyance; and ask not of me meats, and wine, and sauces, and
silken robes, and a sumptuous table. But if I shall show that apart from
all these such a life as that is present (within our reach), then
welcome thou this pleasure, and this life: for the most part of painful
things happen to us from our not calculating things as we ought. Who
then will have the most sorrows—he that cares for none of these things,
or he that cares for them? He that fears changes, or he that does not
fear? He that is in dread of jealousy, of envy, of false accusations, of
plottings, of destruction, or he that stands aloof from these fears? He
that wants many things, or he that wants nothing? He that is a slave to
masters without number, or he that is a slave to none? He that has need
of many things, or he that is free? He that has one lord to fear, or he
that fears despots innumerable? Well then, greater is the pleasure here.
This then let us pursue, and not be excited about the things present:
but let us laugh to scorn all the pomp of life, and everywhere practise
moderation, that we may be enabled so to pass through this life, that it
may be without pain, and to attain unto the good things promised,
through the grace and mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ, with Whom to the
Father and the Holy Ghost together be glory, might, honor, now and ever,
world without end. Amen.

id="vi.lii-p9.25"></span>

<span id="vi.lii-p10"></span> The correct interpretation of [Acts
26:28](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#028.md),
[29](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#029.md)<span id="vi.lii-p10.1"></span>
depends upon the ff. points: (1) Whether the remark of Agrippa is
sincere or ironical. (2) Whether the true text in [Acts
26.29](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#029.md)<span id="vi.lii-p10.2"></span>
is <span class="Greek"><span id="vi.lii-p10.3"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.lii-p10.4"></span>ν πολλῷ</span> or <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.lii-p10.5"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.lii-p10.6"></span>ν μεράλῳ</span>. (3) What
noun, if any, is to be supplied with the adjectives <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.lii-p10.7"></span>ὀ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.lii-p10.8"></span>λίγῳ</span> and <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.lii-p10.9"></span>μεγάλῳ</span> (or <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.lii-p10.10"></span>πολλῷ</span>). Regarding
the first question, the considerations in favor of the view that
Agrippa’s remark is *ironical* are (*a*) the frivolous character of the
man, (*b*) the current use of *Christian* among Jews and Romans as a
term of reproach and contempt. Touching the second point, we find that
<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.lii-p10.11"></span>μεγάλῳ</span> is
favored by <span class="Hebrew"><span id="vi.lii-p10.12"></span>א</span>
A. B. Syr. Copt. Aram. Vulg., as against G. H. for <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.lii-p10.13"></span>πολλῷ</span>. The former
reading is adopted by Tischendorf, Lachmann, Meyer, Westcott and Hort,
and most modern critics, and the evidence in its favor may be considered
decisive. Whether any noun is to be supplied to <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.lii-p10.14"></span>ὀ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.lii-p10.15"></span>λίγῳ</span> and <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.lii-p10.16"></span>μεγάλῳ</span> (as most) or
not (as Meyer) is not important. In any case the sense must be
completed. What do “in little” and “in great” mean? The sense may be
completed by supplying (*a*) the idea of time—“in a little time,” i.e.
almost. In this case, <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.lii-p10.17"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.lii-p10.18"></span>ν μεγάλῳ</span> would have to be rendered
“wholly” or “altogether,” a meaning which <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.lii-p10.19"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.lii-p10.20"></span>ν μεγάλῳ</span> cannot well convey. Another
rendering which might be derived from supplying the idea of
time—differing but slightly from the foregoing—would be: “in a little
time thou art persuading me!” i.e. dost thou think *so soon* to persuade
me? and Paul replies: “Whether in a little time or in a long
time—whether soon or late—I could wish,” etc. The first interpretation
lays emphasis upon the state of Agrippa’s mind—persuaded
*almost*—persuaded *altogether;* the second upon the element of time
required to accomplish the persuasion (ironically spoken of). (*b*) The
idea of labor, trouble or argument may be supplied thus: “Easily—with
few words—or with little trouble—thou persuaded me!” and Paul’s answer
is: Whether with little (labor) or with much, I would to God that,” etc.
This view we prefer, because, (*a*) it harmonizes best with the natural
meaning of <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.lii-p10.21"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.lii-p10.22"></span>ν μεγάλῳ</span> which (if the true reading)
requires taking both phrases in a quantitative sense. (*b*) It is
favored by the evidently *ironical* character of Agrippa’s remark. There
is no ground for the opinion of Chrys. (followed by Calvin) that <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.lii-p10.23"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.lii-p10.24"></span>ν ὀλίγῳ</span> is used in
different senses in the language of Agrippa and Paul, much less for the
idea that Paul did not understand what ἐν ὀλίγῳ meant!—G.B.S.

id="vi.lii-p17.1"></span>καὶ τοῦτο μέσον τίθησι</span>. The innovator
not understanding the phrase, and its reference to <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.lii-p17.2"></span>Εἰ παθητὸς ὁ Χριστὸς</span>
etc., substitutes, “And puts their (words) in the midst.”—The meaning
is: “He had greater things to say than what the prophets had said:” he
could say, “The Christ whom ye slew is risen, for I have seen Him: but
instead of this, he put it as a subject for discussion, Did the prophets
teach that the Christ was to suffer and to rise again?”

<span id="vi.lii-p18"></span> See above, p. 310, note 1, and \*. Yet
some modern commentators assert that <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.lii-p18.1"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.lii-p18.2"></span>ν ὀλίγῳ</span> cannot mean, as Chrys. says,
<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.lii-p18.3"></span>παρὰ μικρόν</span>:
that this sense requires <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.lii-p18.4"></span>ὀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.lii-p18.5"></span>λίγου</span>, or <span class="Greek"><span

id="vi.lii-p18.7"></span>λίγου δεῖν</span>, or <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.lii-p18.8"></span>παῤ ὀλίγον</span>: so that, in their view,
Chrysostom’s remark <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.lii-p18.9"></span>οὕτως ἰδιώτης ἦν</span> would be quite out of
place.—In the next sentence <span class="Greek"><span

Ben. renders it without the negative *Et non dixit, Vellem.*

suffer trouble as an evil-doer even unto bonds.” To others, this might
seem a twofold aggravation: both that he was treated as a malefactor,
and that his destruction was intended. For if indeed he was put in bonds

class="Greek"><span id="vi.lii-p19.5"></span>ἐπ᾽ ἀγάθῳ</span>, the thing
bore its comfort with it, and such was the case to him, but not in their
intention; which was, that he should be in chains <span

<span id="vi.lii-p21"></span> Mod. text adds, “To say this, belongs to
Paul only: ours it is, who are so far removed from him as the heaven is
from the earth, to hide our faces, so that we dare not even to open our
