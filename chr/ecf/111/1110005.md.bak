<span id="vi-p6"></span> These Sermons were preached at Constantinople,
in the second or third year of St. Chrysostom’s archiepiscopate: see
Hom. xliv. “Lo, by the grace of God, we also have been by the space of
three years, not indeed night and day exhorting you, but often every
third, or at least every seventh, day doing this.” It appears from Hom.
i. that the course began during the weeks of Easter: at which season the
Book of Acts was by long established practice read in other Churches (as
at Antioch and in Africa), if not at Constantinople. See St. Chrys.
*Hom. Cur in Pentecoste Acta legantur*, and St. August. *Tr. in Joann*.
vi. 18.
