<span id="vi.xxi-p2"></span>[Acts
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#026.md),
[27](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#027.md)<span id="vi.xxi-p2.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xxi-p3"></span>“And when Saul was come to Jerusalem, he
assayed to join himself to the disciples: but they were all afraid of
him, and believed not that he was a disciple. But Barnabas took him, and
brought him to the Apostles, and declared unto them how he had seen the
Lord in the way.”

<span id="vi.xxi-p4"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="vi.xxi-p4.1"></span>One</span> may well be much at a loss here to
understand how it is that, whereas in the Epistle to the Galatians Paul
says, “I went not to Jerusalem,” but “into Arabia” and “to Damascus,”
and, “After three years I went up to Jerusalem,” and “to see Peter”
([Gal. i. 17](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#017.md)<span
id="vi.xxi-p4.2"></span>), (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxi-p4.3"></span>ἱ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxi-p4.4"></span>στορἥσαι</span> Cat.) here the writer says the
contrary. (There, Paul says,) “And none of the Apostles saw I; but here,
it is said (Barnabas), brought him to the Apostles.”—Well, then, either
(Paul) means, “I went not up with intent to refer or attach myself to
them (<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxi-p4.5"></span>ἀ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxi-p4.6"></span>ναθέσθαι</span>)—for what
saith he? “I referred not myself, neither went I to Jerusalem to those
who were Apostles before me:” <span id="fr_490"></span>[491](#fn_490.md) or
else, that the laying await for him in Damascus was after his return
from Arabia; <span id="fr_491"></span>[492](#fn_491.md) or else, again,
that the visit to Jerusalem was after he came from Arabia. Certainly of
his own accord he went not to the Apostles, but “assayed to join himself
unto the disciples”—as being <span id="fr_492"></span>[493](#fn_492.md) a
teacher, not a disciple—“I went not,” he says, “for this purpose, that I
should go to those who were Apostles before me: certainly, I learnt
nothing from them.” Or, <span id="fr_493"></span>[494](#fn_493.md) he does
not speak of this visit, but passes it by, so that the order is, “I went
into Arabia, then I came to Damascus, then to Jerusalem, then to Syria:”
or else, again, that he went up to Jerusalem, then was sent to Damascus,
then to Arabia, then again to Damascus, then to Cæsarea. Also, the visit
“after fourteen years,” probably, was when he brought up the \[alms to
the\] brethren together with Barnabas: ([Gal. ii.
1](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#001)<span id="vi.xxi-p8.14"></span>.md) or
else he means a different occasion. ([Acts xi.
30](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#030.md)<span
id="vi.xxi-p8.15"></span>.) <span id="fr_494"></span>[495](#fn_494.md) For
the Historian for conciseness, often omits incidents, and condenses the
times. Observe how unambitious the writer is, and how he does not even
relate (related in [Acts 22.17-21](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#017.md)<span
id="vi.xxi-p9.5"></span>) that vision, but passes it by. “He assayed,”
it says, “to join himself to the disciples. And they were afraid of
him.” By this again is shown the ardor of Paul’s character: not (only)
from the mouth of Ananias, and of those who wondered at him there, but
also of those in Jerusalem: “they believed not that he was a disciple:”
for truly that was beyond all human expectation. <span
id="fr_495"></span>[496](#fn_495.md) He <span
id="fr_496"></span>[497](#fn_496.md) was no longer a wild beast, but a man
mild and gentle! And observe how he does not go to the Apostles, such is
his forbearance, but to the disciples, as being a disciple. He was not
thought worthy of credit. “But Barnabas”—“Son of Consolation” is his
appellation, whence also he makes himself easy of access to the man: for
“he was a kind man” ([Acts 11.24](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#024.md)<span
id="vi.xxi-p11.28"></span>), exceedingly, and this is proved both by the
present instance, and in the affair of John (Mark)—“having taken him,
brought him to the Apostles, and related to them how he had seen the
Lord in the way.” <span id="fr_497"></span>[498](#fn_497.md) ([Acts
15.39](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#039)<span id="vi.xxi-p12.8"></span>..md)
It is likely that at Damascus also he had heard all about him: whence
*he* was not afraid but the others were, for he was a man whose glance
inspired fear. “How,” it says, “he had seen the Lord in the way, and
that He had spoken unto him, and how in Damascus he had spoken boldly in
the name of the Lord. And he was with them coming in and going out at
Jerusalem, and speaking boldly in the name of Jesus” ([Acts
9.28](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#028)<span id="vi.xxi-p12.9"></span>.md):
these things were demonstrative of the former, and by his acts he made
good what was spoken of him. “And he spake, and disputed with the
Hellenists.” ([Acts 9.29](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#029.md)<span
id="vi.xxi-p12.10"></span>.) So then the disciples were afraid of him,
and the Apostles did not trust him; by this therefore he relieves them
of their fear. “With the Hellenists:” he means those who used the Greek
tongue: and this he did, very wisely; for those others, those profound
Hebrews had no mind even to see him. “But they,” it says, “went about to
slay him:” a token, this, of his energy, and triumphant victory, and of
their exceeding annoyance at what had happened. Thereupon, fearing lest
the issue should be the same as in the case of Stephen, they sent him to
Cæsarea. For it says, “When the brethren were aware of this, they
brought him down to Cæsarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus” ([Acts
9.30](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#030)<span id="vi.xxi-p12.11"></span>.md),
at the same time to preach, and likely to be more in safety, as being in
his own country. But observe, I pray you, how far it is from being the
case that everything is done by (miraculous) grace; how, on the
contrary, God does in many things leave them to manage for themselves by
their own wisdom and in a human way; so <span
id="fr_498"></span>[499](#fn_498.md) to cut off the excuse of idle people:
for if it was so in the case of Paul, much more in theirs. <span
id="fr_499"></span>[500](#fn_499.md) “Then, it says, “the Church throughout
all Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace (they), being edified, and
walking in the fear of the Lord, and abounded in the comfort of the Holy
Ghost.” <span id="fr_500"></span>[501](#fn_500.md) ([Acts
9.31](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#031)<span id="vi.xxi-p15.7"></span>..md)
He is about to relate that Peter goes down (from Jerusalem), therefore
that you may not impute this to fear, he first says this. For while
there was persecution, he was in Jerusalem, but when the affairs of the
Church are everywhere in security, then it is that he leaves Jerusalem.
See how fervent and energetic he is! For he did not think, because there
was peace, therefore there was no need of his presence. Paul <span
id="fr_501"></span>[502](#fn_501.md) departed, and there was peace: there
is no war nor disturbance. Them, they respected most, as having often
stood by them, and as being held in admiration by the multitude: but
him, they despised, and were more savage against him. See, how great a
war, and immediately, peace! See what that war effected. It dispersed
the peace-makers. In Samaria, Simon was put to shame: in Judea, the
affair of Sapphira took place. Not that, because there was peace,
therefore matters became relaxed, but such was the peace as also to need
exhortation. “And it came to pass, as Peter passed throughout all
quarters, he came down also to the saints which dwelt at Lydda.” ([Acts
9.32](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#032)<span id="vi.xxi-p16.4"></span>..md)
Like the commander of an army, he went about, inspecting the ranks, what
part was compact, what in good order, what needed his presence. See how
on all occasions he goes about, foremost. When an Apostle was to be
chosen, he was the foremost: when the Jews were to be told, that these
were “not drunken,” when the lame man was to be healed, when harangues
to be made, he is before the rest: when the rulers were to be spoken to,
he was the man; when Ananias, he ([Acts
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#015.md), [Acts
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#015.md), [Acts
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#004.md), [Acts
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#008.md), [Acts
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#003)<span id="vi.xxi-p16.5"></span>..md):
when healings were wrought by the shadow, still it was he. And look:
where there was danger, he was the man, and where good <span
id="fr_502"></span>[503](#fn_502) management (was needed.md); but where all
is calm, there they act all in common, and he demands no greater honor
(than the others). When need was to work miracles, he starts forward,
and here again he is the man to labor and toil. “And there he found a
certain man named Æneas, which had kept his bed eight years, and was
sick of the palsy. And Peter said unto him, Æneas, Jesus Christ maketh
thee whole: arise, and make thy bed. And he arose immediately.” ([Acts
9:33](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#033.md),
[34](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#034)<span id="vi.xxi-p17.6"></span>..md)
And why did he not wait for the man’s faith, and ask if he wished to be
healed? In the first place, the miracle served for exhortation to many:
hear then how great the gain. “And all that dwelt at Lydda and Saron saw
him, and turned to the Lord.” ([Acts
9.35](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#035)<span id="vi.xxi-p17.7"></span>..md)
For the man was notable. “Arise, and make thy bed:” he does well to give
a proof of the miracle: for they not only released men of their
diseases, but in giving the health they gave the strength also.
Moreover, at that time they had given no proofs of their power, so that
the man could not reasonably have been required to show his faith, as
neither in the case of the lame man did they demand it. ([Acts
3.6](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#006)<span id="vi.xxi-p17.8"></span>..md)
As therefore Christ in the beginning of His miracles did not demand
faith, so neither did these. For in Jerusalem indeed, as was but
reasonable, the faith of the parties was first shown; “they brought out
their sick into the streets, but as Peter passed by, his shadow at least
might fall upon some of them” ([Acts
5.15](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#015)<span id="vi.xxi-p17.9"></span>.md);
for many miracles had been wrought there; but here this is the first
that occurs. For of the miracles, some were wrought for the purpose of
drawing others (to faith); some for the comfort of them that believed.
“Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by
interpretation is called Dorcas: this woman was full of good works and
alms-deeds which she did. And it came to pass in those days, that she
was sick, and died: whom when they had washed, they laid her in an upper
chamber. And forasmuch as Lydda was nigh to Joppa, and the disciples had
heard that Peter was there, they sent unto him two men, desiring him
that he would not delay to come to them.” ([Acts
9.36-38](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#036.md)<span
id="vi.xxi-p17.10"></span>). Why did they wait till she was dead? Why
was not Peter solicited (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxi-p17.11"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxi-p17.12"></span>σκύλη</span>) before this? So right-minded
(<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxi-p17.13"></span>φιλοσοφοὕντες</span>) were they, they did not
think it proper to trouble (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxi-p17.14"></span>σκύλλειν</span>) the Disciples about such
matters, and to take them away from the preaching: as indeed this is why
it mentions that the place was near, seeing <span
id="fr_503"></span>[504](#fn_503.md) they asked this as a thing beside his
mark, and not now in the regular course. “Not to delay to come unto
them:” for she was a disciple. And Peter arose, and went with them. And
when he was come, they led him into the upper chamber.” ([Acts
9.39](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#039)<span id="vi.xxi-p18.16"></span>..md)
They do not beseech, but leave it to him to give her life (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxi-p18.17"></span>σωτηρίαν</span>.)
See <span id="fr_504"></span>[505](#fn_504.md) what a cheering inducement
to alms is here! “And all the widows,” it says, “stood round him
weeping, and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas had made while
she was with them.” Peter went into the apartment, as one who took it
calmly, but see what an accession came of it! It is not without a
meaning that the Writer has informed us of the woman’s name, but to show
that the name she bore (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxi-p19.5"></span>φερώνυμος ἦν</span>) matched her character; as
active and wakeful was she as an antelope. For in many instances there
is a Providence in the giving of names, as we have often told you. “She
was full,” it says, “of good works:” not only of alms, but “of good
works,” first, and then of this good work in particular. “Which,” it
says, “Dorcas made while she was with them.” Great humility! Not as we
do; but they were all together in common, and in company with them she
made these things and worked. “But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled
down, and prayed; and turning him to the body said, Tabitha, arise. And
she opened her eyes: and when she saw Peter, she sat up.” ([Acts
9.40](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#040)<span id="vi.xxi-p19.6"></span>..md)
Why does he put them all out? That he may not be confused nor disturbed
by their weeping. “And having knelt down, he prayed.” Observe the
intentness of his prayer. “And <span id="fr_505"></span>[506](#fn_505.md)
he gave her his hand.” ([Acts
9.41](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#041)<span id="vi.xxi-p20.10"></span>..md)
So did Christ to the daughter of Jairus: “And (says the Evangelist)
having taken her by the hand.” Mark severally, first the life, then the
strength brought into her, the one by the word, the other by his
hand—“And he gave her his hand, and lifted her up, and when he had
called the saints and widows, presented her alive:” to some for comfort,
because they received back their sister, and because they saw the
miracle, and for kindly support (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxi-p20.11"></span>προστασίαν</span>) to others. “And it was
known throughout all Joppa; and many believed in the Lord. And it came
to pass, that he tarried many days in Joppa with one Simon a tanner.”
([Acts 9.42-43](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#042.md)<span
id="vi.xxi-p20.12"></span>.) Mark the unassuming conduct, mark the
moderation of Peter, how he does not make his abode with this lady, or
some other person of distinction, but with a tanner: by all his acts
leading men to humility, neither suffering the mean to be ashamed, nor
the great to be elated! “Many days;” <span
id="fr_506"></span>[507](#fn_506.md) for they needed his instruction, who
had believed through the miracles.—Let us look then again at what has
been said.

<span id="vi.xxi-p22"></span>“Assayed,” it says, “to join himself to the
disciples.” (Recapitulation, [Acts
9.26](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#026)<span id="vi.xxi-p22.1"></span>..md)
He did not come up to them unabashed, but with a subdued manner.
“Disciples” <span id="fr_507"></span>[508](#fn_507.md) they were all called
at that time by reason of their great virtue, for there was the likeness
of the disciples plainly to be seen. “But they were all afraid of him.”
See how they feared the dangers, how the alarm was yet at its height in
them. “But Barnabas,” etc. ([Acts
9.27](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#027.md)<span
id="vi.xxi-p23.1"></span>.)—it seems to me that Barnabas was of old a
friend of his—“and related,” etc.: observe how Paul says nothing of all
this himself: nor would he have brought it forward to the others, had he
not been compelled to do so. “And he was with them, coming in and going
out at Jerusalem, and speaking boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus.”
([Acts 9:28](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#028.md),
[29](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#029)<span id="vi.xxi-p23.2"></span>..md)
This gave them all confidence. “But they went about to slay him: which
when the brethren knew” etc. ([Acts
9.30](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#030)<span id="vi.xxi-p23.3"></span>..md)
Do you observe how both there (at Damascus), and here, the rest take
care for him, and provide for him the means of departure, and that we
nowhere find him thus far receiving (direct supernatural) aid from God?
So the energy of his character is betokened. “To Cæsarea, and sent him
forth to Tarsus:” so that, I suppose, he did not continue his journey by
land, but sailed the rest of it. And this (departure) is Providentially
ordered, that he might preach there also: and so likewise were the plots
against him ordered by God’s Providence, and his coming to Jerusalem,
that the story about him might no longer be disbelieved. For there he
was “speaking boldly,” it says, “in the name of the Lord Jesus; and he
spake and disputed against the Hellenists;” and again, “he was with them
coming in and going out.—So <span id="fr_508"></span>[509](#fn_508.md) the
Church throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace”—i.e. it
increased: and peace with itself, that peace which is peace indeed: for
the war from without would have done them no harm —“they being edified,
and walking in the fear of the Lord, and abounded in the consolation of
the Holy Ghost.” And the spirit consoled them both by the miracles and
by the works, and independently of these in the person of each
individual. “And it came to pass, etc. And Peter said unto him, Eneas,”
etc. ([Acts 9.32-34](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#032.md)<span
id="vi.xxi-p24.5"></span>.) <span id="fr_509"></span>[510](#fn_509.md) But
before discourse, before exhortations, he says to the lame man himself,
“Jesus Christ maketh thee whole.” This word he believed in any wise, and
was made whole. Observe how unassuming he is: for he said not, “In the
Name,” but <span id="fr_510"></span>[511](#fn_510.md) rather as a sign he
narrates the miracle itself, and speaks as its Evangelist. “And having
seen him,” it says, “all that dwelt in Lydda, and Saron, turned unto the
Lord.—Now there was at Joppa,” etc. ([Acts
9:35](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#035.md),
[36](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#036)<span id="vi.xxi-p26.5"></span>..md)
Observe everywhere the signs taking place. But let us so believe them,
as if we were now beholding them. It is not simply said, that Tabitha
died, but that she died, having been in a state of weakness. And (yet)
they did not call Peter until she died; then “they sent and told him not
to delay to come unto them.” Observe, they send and call him by others.
And he comes: he did not think it a piece of disrespect, to be summoned
by two men: for, it says, “they sent two men unto him.”—Affliction, my
beloved, is a great thing, and rivets our souls together. Not a word of
wailing there, nor of mourning. See <span
id="fr_511"></span>[512](#fn_511.md) how thoroughly matters are cleansed!
“Having washed her,” it says, “they laid her in an upper chamber:” that
is, they did all (that was right) for the dead body. Then Peter having
come, “knelt down, and prayed; and turning him to the body, said,
Tabitha, arise.” ([Acts 9.40](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#040.md)<span
id="vi.xxi-p27.3"></span>.) They did not perform all their miracles with
the same ease. But this was profitable for them: for truly God took
thought not only for the salvation of others, but for their own. He that
healed so many by his very shadow, how is it that he now has to do so
much first? There are cases also in which the faith of the applicants
coöperated. This is the first dead person that he raises. Observe how
he, as it were, awakes her out of sleep: first she opened her eyes: then
upon seeing (Peter) she sat up: then from his hand she received
strength. “And it was known throughout all Joppa, and many believed in
the Lord.” ([Acts 9.42](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#042.md)<span
id="vi.xxi-p27.4"></span>.) Mark the gain, mark the fruit, that it was
not for display. Indeed, this is why he puts them all out, imitating his
Master in this also.

<span id="vi.xxi-p28"></span> <span id="fr_512"></span>[513](#fn_512.md)
For where tears are—or rather, where miracles are, there tears ought not
to be; not where such a mystery is celebrating. Hear, I beseech you:
although somewhat of the like kind does not take place now, yet in the
case of our dead likewise, a great mystery is celebrating. Say, <span
id="fr_513"></span>[514](#fn_513.md) if as we sit together, the Emperor
were to send and invite some one of us to the palace, would it be right,
I ask, to weep and mourn? Angels are present, commissioned from heaven
and come from thence, sent from the King Himself to call their fellow
servant, and say, dost thou weep? Knowest thou not what a mystery it is
that is taking place, how awful, how dread, and worthy indeed of hymns
and lauds? Wouldest thou learn, that thou mayest know, that this is no
time for tears? For it is a very great mystery of the Wisdom of God. As
if leaving her dwelling, the soul goes forth, speeding on her way to her
own Lord, and dost thou mourn? Why then, thou shouldst do this on the
birth of a child: for this in fact is also a birth, and a better than
that. For here she goes forth to a very different light, is loosed as
from a prison-house, comes off as from a contest. “Yes,” say you, “it is
all very well to say this, <span id="fr_514"></span>[515](#fn_514.md) in
the case of those of whose salvation we are assured.” Then, what ails
thee, O man, that even in the case of such, thou dost not take it in
this way? Say, what canst thou have to condemn in the little child? Why
dost thou mourn for it? What in the newly baptized? for he too is
brought into the same condition: why dost thou mourn for him? For as the
sun arises clear and bright, so the soul, leaving the body with a pure
conscience, shines joyously. Not such the spectacle of Emperor as he
comes in state to take possession of the city (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxi-p31.12"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxi-p31.13"></span>πιβαίνοντα πόλεως</span>), not such the hush
of awe, as when the soul having quitted the body is departing in company
with Angels. Think what the soul must then be! in what amazement, what
wonder, what delight! Why mournest thou? Answer me.—But it is only in
the case of sinners thou doest this? Would that it were so, and I would
not forbid your mournings, would that this were the object! This
lamentation were Apostolic, this were after the pattern of the Lord; for
even Jesus wept over Jerusalem. I would that your mournings were
discriminated by this rule. But when thou speakest the words of
one <span id="fr_515"></span>[516](#fn_515.md) that would call back (the
dead), and speakest of thy long intimacy and his beneficence, it is but
for this thou mournest (not because he was a sinner), thou dost but
pretend to say it. Mourn, bewail the sinner, and I too will give a loose
to tears; I, more than thou, the greater the punishment to which he is
liable as such: I too will lament, with such an object. But not thou
alone must lament him that is such; the whole city must do the same, and
all that meet you on the way, as men bewail them that are led to be put
to death. For this is a death indeed, an evil death, the death of
sinners. But (with you) all is clean reversed. Such lamentation marks a
lofty mind, and conveys much instruction; the other marks a littleness
of soul. If we all lamented with this sort of lamentation, we should
amend the persons themselves while yet living. For as, if it rested with
thee to apply medicines which would prevent that bodily death, thou
wouldest use them, just so now, if *this* death were the death thou
lamentest, thou wouldest prevent its taking place, both in thyself and
in him. Whereas now our behavior is a perfect riddle; that having it in
our power to hinder its coming, we let it take place, and mourn over it
when it has come. Worthy indeed of lamentations are they (when we
consider), what time as they shall stand before the judgment seat of
Christ, what words they shall then hear, what they shall suffer! To no
purpose have these men lived: nay, not to no purpose, but to evil
purpose! Of them too it may be fitly said, “It were good for them had
they never been born.” (<span id="vi.xxi-p32.6"></span>[Mark xiv.
21](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#021)<span id="vi.xxi-p32.7"></span>..md)
For what profit is it, I ask, to have spent so much time to the hurt of
his own person? Had it been spent only to no purpose, were not that, I
ask you, punishment enough! If one who has been an hired servant twenty
years were to find that he has had all his labor in vain, would he not
weep and lament, and think himself the most miserable of men? Why, here
is a man who has lost all the labor of a whole life: not one day has he
lived for himself, but to luxury, to debauchery, to covetousness, to
sin, to the devil. Then, say, shall we not bewail this man? shall we not
try to snatch him from his perils? For it is, yes, it is possible, if we
will, to mitigate his punishment, if we make continual prayers for him,
if for him we give alms. However unworthy he may be, God will yield to
our importunity. For if <span id="fr_516"></span>[517](#fn_516.md) Paul
showed mercy on one (who had no claims on his mercy), and for the sake
of others spared one (whom he would not have spared), much more is it
right for us to do this. By means of his substance, by means of thine
own, by what means thou wilt, aid him: pour in oil, nay rather, water.
Has he no alms-deeds of his own to exhibit? Let him have at least those
of his kindred. Has he none done by himself? At least let him have those
which are done for him, that his wife may with confidence beg him off in
that day, having paid down the ransom for him. The more sins he has to
answer for, the greater need has he of alms, not only for this reason,
but because the alms has not the same virtue now, but far less: for it
is not all one to have done it himself, and to have another do it for
him; therefore, the virtue being less, let us by quantity make it the
greatest. Let us not busy ourselves about monuments, not about
memorials. This is the greatest memorial: set widows to stand around
him. Tell them his name: bid them all make for him their prayers, their
supplications: this will overcome God: though it have not been done by
the man himself, yet because of him another is the author of the
almsgiving. Even this pertains to the mercy of God: “widows standing
around and weeping” know how to rescue, not indeed from the present
death, but from that which is to come. Many have profited even by the
alms done by others on their behalf: for even if they have not got
perfect (deliverance), at least they have found some comfort thence. If
it be not so, how are children saved? And yet there, the children
themselves contribute nothing, but their parents do all: and often have
women had their children given them, though the children themselves
contributed nothing. Many are the ways God gives us to be saved, only
let us not be negligent.

<span id="vi.xxi-p34"></span>How then if one be poor? say you. Again I
say, the greatness of the alms is not estimated by the quantity given,
but by the purpose. Only give not less than thine ability, and thou hast
paid all. How then, say you, if he be desolate and a stranger, and have
none to care for him? And why is it that he has none, I ask you? In this
very thing thou sufferest thy desert, that thou hast none to be thus thy
friend, thus virtuous. This is so ordered on purpose that, though we be
not ourselves virtuous, we may study to have virtuous companions and
friends—both wife, and son, and friend—as reaping some good even through
them, a slight gain indeed, but yet a gain. If thou make it thy chief
object not to marry a rich wife, <span id="fr_517"></span>[518](#fn_517.md)
but to have a devout wife, and a religious daughter, thou shalt gain
this consolation; if thou study to have thy son not rich but devout,
thou shalt also gain this consolation. If thou make these thine objects
then wilt thyself be such as they. This also is part of virtue, to
choose such friends, and such a wife and children. Not in vain are the
oblations made for the departed, not in vain the prayers, not in vain
the almsdeeds: all those things hath the Spirit ordered, <span
id="fr_518"></span>[519](#fn_518.md) wishing us to be benefited one by the
other. See: he is benefited, thou art benefited: because of him, thou
hast despised wealth, being set on to do some generous act: both thou
art the means of salvation to him, and he to thee the occasion of thine
almsgiving. Doubt not that he shall get some good thereby. It is not for
nothing that the Deacon cries, “For them that are fallen asleep in
Christ, and for them that make the memorials for them.” It is not the
Deacon that utters this voice, but the Holy Ghost: I speak of the Gift.
What sayest thou? There is the Sacrifice in hand, and all things laid
out duly ordered: Angels are there present, Archangels, the Son of God
is there: all stand with such awe, and in the general silence those
stand by, crying aloud: and thinkest thou that what is done, is done in
vain? Then is not the rest also all in vain, both the oblations made for
the Church, and those for the priests, and for the whole body? God
forbid! but all is done with faith. What thinkest thou of the oblation
made for the martyrs, of the calling made in that hour, martyrs though
they be, yet even “for martyrs?” <span id="fr_519"></span>[520](#fn_519.md)
It is a great honor to be named in the presence of the Lord, when that
memorial is celebrating, the dread Sacrifice, the unutterable mysteries.
For just as, so long as the Emperor is seated, is the time for the
petitioner to effect what he wishes to effect, but when he is risen, say
what he will, it is all in vain, so at that time, while the celebration
of the mysteries is going on, it is for all men the greatest honor to be
held worthy of mention. For look: then is declared the dread mystery,
that God gave Himself for the world: along with that mystery he
seasonably puts Him in mind of them that have sinned. For as when the
celebration of Emperors’ victories is in progress, then, as many as had
their part in the victory receive their meed of praise, while at the
same time as many as are in bonds are set at liberty in honor of the
occasion; but when the occasion is past, he that did not obtain this
favor then, no longer gets any: so is it here likewise: this is the time
of celebration of a victory. For, saith it, “so often as ye eat this
bread, ye do show forth the Lord’s death.” Then let us not approach
indifferently, nor imagine that these things are done in any ordinary
sort. But it is in another sense <span id="fr_520"></span>[521](#fn_520.md)
that we make mention of martyrs, and this, for assurance that the Lord
is not dead: and this, for a sign that death has received its death’s
blow, that death itself is dead. Knowing these things, let us devise
what consolations we can for the departed, instead of tears, instead of
laments, instead of tombs, our alms, our prayers, our oblations, that
both they and we may attain unto the promised blessings, by the grace
and loving-kindness of His only-begotten Son our Lord Jesus Christ, with
Whom to the Father and the Holy Ghost together be glory, dominion,
honor, now and ever, world without end. Amen.

<span id="vi.xxi-p5"></span> St. Chrysostom’s exposition cannot be
correctly reported here. Perhaps what he did say, was in substance as
follows: “but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus:
whence we learn, that the plot against him at Damascus was after his
return from Arabia, and then the visit (to Jerusalem), after the escape
from Damascus. Certainly of his own accord he went not to the Apostles,”
etc.—(So far, the first hypothesis, viz. that the visit, [Acts
ix.](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#000.md)<span id="vi.xxi-p5.1"></span> and
the visit in Gal. are one and the same. Then) “or else, Paul does not
mean *this* visit (viz. after the flight from Damascus), but passes it
by, so that the order (in his narration) is as follows: I went to
Arabia, then to Damascus, then viz., at some time during the residence
in Damascus, to Jerusalem (to see Peter), then to Syria, i.e. back to
Damascus: whereas, had he related matters fully, it should have been,
that he went into Arabia, thence to Damascus, then to Jerusalem to see
Peter, thence to Damascus again, then again to Jerusalem after the
escape from D., thence to Cæsarea.”

17-21](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#017.md)<span id="vi.xxi-p8.7"></span>,
is referred to; the subject therefore of <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxi-p8.8"></span>λέγει, ἀφίησιν</span> is Paul, and <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxi-p8.9"></span>ταύτην</span> means the
visit in [Acts ix.](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#000.md)<span
id="vi.xxi-p8.10"></span> The next sentence, for <span

class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxi-p8.12"></span>εἰ μὴ τοῦτο πάλιν κ. τ.

reporter, or redactor, seems to have intended a recital of St. Paul’s
movements before as well as after his conversion; viz. (from Tarsus) he
went up to Jerusalem, then was sent (by the high-priest) to Damascus:
then (after his conversion) went into Arabia (the mod. substitutes,
Syria): then returned to Damascus: then (omitting all the rest) to
Cæsarea.—In the *Comment. on Gal.* i. t. x. 675, D. Chrys. expounds
thus: “Whereas he says, ‘I went not up,’ this also may be said, that he
went not up at the outset of his preaching, and, when he did, it was not
for the purpose of learning.”

<span id="fn_494"></span>[i:495](1110026.htm#fr_494.md) <span

<span id="vi.xxi-p9"></span> Chrys. here confuses the visits of Paul to
Jerusalem. That mentioned in <span id="vi.xxi-p9.1"></span>[Acts xi.
30](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#030.md)<span id="vi.xxi-p9.2"></span>, was
the second visit, when he went to carry the gift of alms to the poor.
The visit mentioned in [Gal. ii.
1](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#001.md)<span id="vi.xxi-p9.3"></span>,
synchronizes with [Acts xv. 1](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#001.md)<span
id="vi.xxi-p9.4"></span>, sq., when Paul went to attend the Apostolic
council.—G.B.S.

<span id="fn_495"></span>[i:496](1110026.htm#fr_495.md) <span
id="vi.xxi-p9.6"></span>

<span id="vi.xxi-p10"></span> The incredulity of the Christians at
Jerusalem concerning the genuineness of Saul’s conversion is difficult
to understand, especially since they must have heard of the miraculous
manner of it. It can, however, more readily be conceived of if, as we
suppose, the three years absence from the city had intervened, and
during this period, Saul had been unheard of. The impression might have
gone abroad that he had fallen back into his old Jewish life. Certainly
the persecution which the Christians at Jerusalem had suffered at his
hands would incline them to be incredulous concerning his conversion,
unless there were positive proof of it. When it is said ([Acts
9.27](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#027)<span id="vi.xxi-p10.1"></span>.md)
that Barnabas brought Paul “to the apostles” in Jerusalem, we must hold
this statement subject to the modification made in Paul’s own statement
([Gal. i. 18](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#018.md)<span
id="vi.xxi-p10.2"></span>) that during this visit he saw, of the
apostles, only Peter and James, the Lord’s brother. These may have been
the only apostles then in the city, for Paul’s stay was but for fifteen
days. The purpose of this visit was to see Peter (<span
id="vi.xxi-p10.3"></span>[Gal. i.
18](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#018.md)<span
id="vi.xxi-p10.4"></span>).—G.B.S.

<span id="fn_496"></span>[i:497](1110026.htm#fr_496.md) <span

<span id="vi.xxi-p11"></span> A. B. C. <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxi-p11.1"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxi-p11.2"></span>κεῖνο</span>. <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxi-p11.3"></span>Βαρνάβας δὲ ἄνθρωπος ἐπιεικὴς καὶ ἥμερος ἥν·
καὶ ὅρα κ. τ. λ</span>. Cat. <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxi-p11.4"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxi-p11.5"></span>κεῖ. Βαρνάβας ἄνθρωπος ἐπιεικὴς ἦν· καὶ
ὅρα</span>. The epithet <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxi-p11.6"></span>ἥ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxi-p11.7"></span>μερος</span>, “tamed,” was felt to be
unsuitable to Barnabas, hence Cat. omits it, Œc. substitutes (from
below) <span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxi-p11.8"></span>καὶ χρηστὸς
σφόδρα</span>. The mod. t. transposes the clause to the comment on [Acts
9.27](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#027.md)<span id="vi.xxi-p11.9"></span>.
The fact seems to be, that <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxi-p11.10"></span>Βαρνάβας δὲ</span> is out of its place, and
that <span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxi-p11.11"></span>ἄ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxi-p11.12"></span>νθρ. ἐπ. καὶ ἡμ</span>. is
a description of Saul’s present bearing contrasted with his former
character: and that the sentence should begin with <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxi-p11.13"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxi-p11.14"></span>κεῖνο</span>, somewhat in
this way: <span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxi-p11.15"></span>οὐ γὰρ ἦν
ὄντως προσδοκίας ἀνθρωπίνης. ᾽Εκεῖνο</span> e.g. <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxi-p11.16"></span>τὸ θήριον</span>, that
raging wild-beast, now was a man, mild and gentle.—Below, all the <span
class="c14"><span id="vi.xxi-p11.17"></span>mss.</span> have <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxi-p11.18"></span>ἅ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxi-p11.19"></span>τε μαθητὴν ὄντα</span>,
which is not easily reconciled with the former passage (note c). There
it is represented, that he assayed to join himself to the disciples as
being a teacher, and not a disciple; here, that he did this as being a
disciple, and <span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxi-p11.20"></span>διὰ τὸ
μετριάζειν</span>. Œc, combines this with the former statement: “he went
not to the Apostles, but assayed,” etc., <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxi-p11.21"></span>μετριάζων, ἅτε διδ. ὢν, καὶ οὐ μαθ</span>.,
where Henten. renders *modeste de se sentiens “quum tamen” præceptor
esset et non discipulus:* rather, forbearing to put himself forward as
he might have done, seeing he was himself a teacher, etc. The Catena has
the <span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxi-p11.22"></span>διὰ τὸ
μετριάζειν</span> after <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxi-p11.23"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxi-p11.24"></span>πιόντα</span>, and again after <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxi-p11.25"></span>ὄ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxi-p11.26"></span>ντα</span>. Hence the true
reading may be, <span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxi-p11.27"></span>καὶ
ὅρα αὐτὸν οὐ πρὸς τ. ἀπ. ἀπιόντα, ἀλλὰ πρὸς τοὺς μαθητάς· οὐχ ἃτε
μαθητὴν ὄντα, ἀλλὰ διὰ τὸ μετριάζειν</span>.

<span id="fn_497"></span>[i:498](1110026.htm#fr_497.md) <span
id="vi.xxi-p11.29"></span>

<span id="vi.xxi-p12"></span> A. B. C. (and Cat.) give the text, “But
Barnabas—in the way,” continuously, and then the comments all strung
together. Also the clause “it is likely—about him” is placed last, after
<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxi-p12.1"></span>γοργὸς ἦν ὁ
ἀνήρ</span>. This expression (Cat. adds <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxi-p12.2"></span>γὰρ</span>) may denote either the quick, keen
glance of Paul’s eye, or the terror with which he was regarded—“to them
the man had a terrible look with him.”—The modern text: “‘But
Barnabas—in the way.’ This Barnabas was a mild and gentle sort of man.
‘Son of Consolation’ is the meaning of his name: whence also he became a
friend to Paul. And that he was exceedingly kind and accessible, is
proved both from the matter in hand, and from the affair of John. Whence
*he* is not afraid, but relates ‘how he had seen,’ etc.—‘in the name of
the Lord Jesus.’ For it is likely, etc. Wherefore also <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxi-p12.3"></span>ταῦτα ἐκείνων
κατασκευαστικὰ ποιῶν, διὰ τῶν ἔργων ἐβεβαίωσε τὰ λεχθέντα</span>.” In
the original text it is simply <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxi-p12.4"></span>Ταῦτα ἐκείνων κατασκευαστικά, καί διὰ τῶν ἔργων
ἐβεβαίωσε τὰ λεχθέντα</span>, which being put before [Acts
9.28](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#028.md)<span id="vi.xxi-p12.5"></span>,
would mean, that the conduct of Paul “in Damascus,” the <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxi-p12.6"></span>πῶς ἐπαρρησ</span>.,
evidenced the truth of what he said, about the Lord’s appearing to him
in the way. Hence in the mod. text: “wherefore Barnabas making the
latter prove the former, confirmed by (Paul’s) deeds the things told of
him.” (But Ben., *Ideo hæc ad illa præparant, dum ille operibus dicta
confirmat. Erasm., Ideo et hæc præparatoria facit operibus confirmans ea
quæ dicta erant.*) We have transposed the clause, as comment on [Acts
9.28](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#028.md)<span id="vi.xxi-p12.7"></span>.

<span id="fn_498"></span>[i:499](1110026.htm#fr_498.md) <span
id="vi.xxi-p12.12"></span>

<span id="vi.xxi-p13"></span> This and the next clause are transposed in
the <span class="c14"><span id="vi.xxi-p13.1"></span>mss.</span> so that
<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxi-p13.2"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxi-p13.3"></span>π᾽ αὐτῶν</span> would mean
“in the case of the brethren.”

<span id="fn_499"></span>[i:500](1110026.htm#fr_499.md) <span
id="vi.xxi-p13.4"></span>

<span id="vi.xxi-p14"></span> The reason given in [Acts
9.30](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#030.md)<span id="vi.xxi-p14.1"></span>
for Paul’s leaving Jerusalem is, that he was in danger of being slain by
his opponents; that assigned by himself in [Acts
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#017.md),
[18](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#018.md)<span id="vi.xxi-p14.2"></span> is
a revelation of the Lord given to him when in a trance in the temple,
warning him that Jerusalem would not receive his message, and charging
him to go unto the Gentiles. The two explanations have a common element
in the opposition of the Jews and Hellenists at Jerusalem to Paul and
their rejection of his message. “Paul, notwithstanding the opposition
and machinations of the Jews, may have felt desirous to remain: he had a
warm heart toward his brethren according to the flesh; he was eager for
their conversion; and it required a revelation from Christ himself to
cause him to comply with the importunity of his friends and to depart.
Luke mentions the external reason; Paul the internal motive.”
(Gloag.)—G.B.S.

<span id="fn_500"></span>[i:501](1110026.htm#fr_500.md) <span
id="vi.xxi-p14.3"></span>

<span id="vi.xxi-p15"></span> A. B. C. of N.T. and vulg. Hieron. have
the singular throughout; and so Cat. in 1. Edd. from E. the plural
throughout: our other <span class="c14"><span
id="vi.xxi-p15.1"></span>mss.</span>; <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxi-p15.2"></span>οἰκοδομούενοι</span> and <span

<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxi-p15.4"></span>περισσευόμενοι</span>), “they being edified”
etc., in apposition with <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxi-p15.5"></span>᾽</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxi-p15.6"></span>Εκκλησία</span>.

<span id="fn_501"></span>[i:502](1110026.htm#fr_501.md) <span
id="vi.xxi-p15.8"></span>

<span id="vi.xxi-p16"></span> i.e. ‘If Paul had remained there would not
have been peace and quiet.’ It is doubtful, as the text stands, whether
the subject to <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxi-p16.1"></span>ᾐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxi-p16.2"></span>δοῦντο</span> is, the Jewish believers, or, the
adversaries: and <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxi-p16.3"></span>κατεφρόνουν, ἠγρίαινον</span> seem inconsistent
as predicated of the same persons. Perhaps what Chrys. said is not fully
reported, and the text may be completed thus: (comp. p. 304,) “there is
no war from without, nor disturbance within. For the Jewish believers
respected the Apostles, as having often stood by them, and the
unbelievers durst not attack them as being had in admiration by the
people: but as for Paul, the one party—viz. the zealous Jewish
believers, ‘the profound Hebrews,’ despised him, while the others—viz.
the unbelievers were more savage against him.” Edd. (from E. alone).
“And why, you may ask, does he this, and ‘passes through’ when there is
peace, and after Paul’s departure, i.e. why does Peter delay his journey
until Paul is gone, and all is quiet? Because them they most respected,
as having,” etc.

<span id="fn_502"></span>[i:503](1110026.htm#fr_502.md) <span
id="vi.xxi-p16.6"></span>

<span id="vi.xxi-p17"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxi-p17.1"></span>Καὶ ἔνθα οἰκονομία· ἔνθα δὲ, κ. τ. λ</span>. It
does not appear what <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxi-p17.2"></span>οἰκονομία</span> can be intended, unless it be
the order taken for the appointment of the deacons, but this was the act
of all the Apostles, [Acts 6.2](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#002.md)<span
id="vi.xxi-p17.3"></span>. Hence perhaps the reading should be: <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxi-p17.4"></span>ἔ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxi-p17.5"></span>νθα δὲ οἰκονομία, καὶ

<span id="vi.xxi-p24"></span> Here the modern text has: “And the
Churches had peace, being edified, and walking in the fear of the Lord:”
i.e. they increased, and (had peace), peace as it is in itself, the true
peace, <span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxi-p24.1"></span>εἰρήνην αὐτὴν

not wait for Eneas to ask, or to show his faith,” as above, p. 301.—Edd.
from E. “‘And it came to pass—maketh thee whole.’ It is not the word of
one making a display, but of confidence that the thing shall be. And it
does very much seem to me, that the sick man believed this word, and was
made whole. That Peter is unassuming, is clear from what follows. For he
said not, In the Name of Jesus, but rather as a miracle he narrates it.
‘And they that dwelt at Lydda saw, and turned unto the Lord.’ It was not
for nothing that I said, that the miracles were wrought in order to
persuade and comfort. ‘But in Joppa—and died.’ Do you mark the miracles
everywhere taking place? It is not merely said, etc. Wherefore also they
do not call Peter until she was dead. ‘And having heard, (that Peter was
there) the disciples sent,’” etc.

(omitted in E. D. F. Edd.): i.e. how the Gospel has purged away all
excess of mourning, and all noisy demonstrations of grief. St. Chrys.
frequently inveighs against the heathenish customs of mourning for the
dead, which were still practised—such as the hiring of heathen
mourning-women: *Hom. in Matt.* xxxi. p. 207. A. “I confess to you, I am
ashamed when I see the troops of women tearing their hair, gashing their
flesh, as they move through the market—and this under the very eyes of
the heathen.” *Conc. in Laz.* v. t. i. p. 765 D. where the Christian
mode of interment is described; viz. the procession of clergy with
psalms and hymns of praise, lighted tapers, etc. comp. *Hom.* iv. *in

was going to say, “Where tears are, it is no fit time for miracles,” but
corrects himself, for put in that way the proposition was not true. The
innovator weakly substitutes, “For where tears are, such a mystery ought
not to be performed: or rather, where miracles are, there tears ought
not to be.”

palace and crowned, thou shouldest bewail and lament, I should not call
thee the friend of him that is crowned, but very much his hater and
enemy. ‘But now, say you, I do not bewail him, but myself.’ But neither
is this the part of a friend, that for thine own sake thou wouldest have
him still in the contest, etc. ‘But I know not where he is gone.’ How
knowest thou not, answer me? For whether he lived rightly or otherwise,
it is plain where he will go. ‘Why, this is the very reason why I do
bewail—because he departed a sinner.’ This is mere pretence. If this
were the reason of thy lamenting him that is gone, thou oughtest while
he was alive to have amended him, and formed his manners,” etc.

also; for if I forgave anything, to whom I forgave it, ‘for your sakes’
forgave I it in the person of Christ.”—St. Chrysostom constantly
teaches, as here, that the souls of the departed are aided by the
prayers, alms, and Eucharistic oblations of the living, *Hom.* xli. *in*
1 *Cor.* u. s. “Even if he did depart a sinner,…we ought to succor him,

by prayers and supplications, and alms and oblations. For not idly have
these things been devised, nor to no purpose do we make mention of the
departed in the Divine Mysteries, and for them draw near, beseeching the
Lamb Which lieth there, Which taketh away the sins of the world, but in
order that some consolation may thence come to them. Nor in vain does he
that stands beside the altar, while the dread Mysteries are celebrating,
cry out, ‘For all that sleep in Christ, and for them that make the
memorials for them.’” See also *Hom.* iii. *ad Phil.* p. 217, 218. Comp.
