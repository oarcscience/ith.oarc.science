<span id="vii.xvii-p1"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vii.xvii-p1.1"></span>Homily XV.</span>

<span id="vii.xvii-p2"></span>[Rom. VIII.
28](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#028.md)<span id="vii.xvii-p2.1"></span>

<span id="vii.xvii-p3"></span>“And we know that all things work together
for good to them that love God.”

<span id="vii.xvii-p4"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="vii.xvii-p4.1"></span>Here</span> he seems to me to have mooted this
whole topic with a view to those who were in danger; or, rather, not
this only, but also what was said a little before this. For the words,
“the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with
the glory which shall be revealed in us;” and those, that “the whole
creation groaneth;” and the saying, that “we are saved by hope;” and the
phrase, “we with patience wait for;” and that, “we know not what we
should pray for as we ought;” are all of them said to these. For he
instructs them not to choose just what they may think, themselves, to be
useful, but what the Spirit may suggest; for many things that seem to
one’s self profitable, do sometimes even cause much harm. Quiet, for
instance, and freedom from dangers, and living out of fear, seemed to be
advantageous for them. And what wonder if they did to them, since to the
blessed Paul himself this seemed to be so? still he came afterwards to
know that the opposite to all these are the things advantageous, and
when he came to know it, he was content. So he that besought the Lord
thrice to be freed from hazards, <span
id="fr_1446"></span>[1447](#fn_1446.md) when once he heard Him say, “My
grace is sufficient for thee, for My Power is perfected in weakness”
(<span id="vii.xvii-p5.2"></span>[2 Cor.
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#008.md),
[9](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#009)<span id="vii.xvii-p5.3"></span>.md),
was afterwards delighted at being persecuted, and insulted, and having
irreparable ills done him. For, “I glory,” he says, “in persecutions, in
insults” (Eng. V. reproaches), “in necessities.” (<span
id="vii.xvii-p5.4"></span>[2 Cor. xii.
10](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#010)<span id="vii.xvii-p5.5"></span>..md)
And this was his reason for saying, “For we know not what we should pray
for as we ought.” And he exhorted all men to give up these matters to
the Spirit. For the Holy Spirit is very mindful of us, and this is the
will of God. Having then cheered them by all methods, he proceeds to
what we have heard to-day, putting forward a reason strong enough to
reclaim them. For he says, “we know that all things work together for
good to them that love God.” Now when he speaks of “all things,” he
mentions even the things that seem painful. For should even tribulation,
or poverty, or imprisonment, or famines, or deaths, or anything else
whatsoever come upon us, God is able to change all these things into the
opposite. For this is quite an instance of His unspeakable power, His
making things seemingly painful to be lightsome to us, and turning them
into that which is helpful to us. And so he does not say, that “them
that love God,” no grievance approacheth, but, that it “works together
for good,” that is to say, that He useth the grievous things themselves
to make the persons so plotted against approved. And this is a much
greater thing than hindering the approach of such grievances, or
stopping them when they have come. And this is what He did even with the
furnace at Babylon. For He did not either prevent their falling into it,
or extinguish the flame after those saints were cast into it, but let it
burn on, and made them by this very flame greater objects of wonder, and
with the Apostles too He wrought other like wonders continually. (St.
<span id="vii.xvii-p5.6"></span>[Mark xvi.
18](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#018)<span id="vii.xvii-p5.7"></span>..md)
For if men who have learnt to be philosophic can use the things of
nature to the opposite of their intention, and appear even when living
in poverty in easier circumstances than the rich, and shine <span
id="fr_1447"></span>[1448](#fn_1447.md) through disgrace: much more will
God work for those that love Him both these and also greater things by
far. For one needs only one thing, a genuine love of Him, and all things
follow that. As then things seemingly harmful do good to these, so do
even things profitable harm those who love Him not. For instance, the
exhibition of miracles and wisdom in His teaching only injured the Jews,
as did the rightness of doctrine; and for the former they called Him a
possessed person ([John viii. 48](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#048.md)<span
id="vii.xvii-p6.2"></span>), for the other one that would be equal to
God ([John 5.18](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#018.md)<span
id="vii.xvii-p6.3"></span>): and because of the miracles ([John
11:47](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#047.md),
[53](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#053)<span id="vii.xvii-p6.4"></span>.md),
they even went about to kill Him. But the thief when crucified, when
nailed to the Cross, and reviled, and suffering ills unnumbered, not
only was not hurt, but even gained the greatest good therefrom. See how
for those who love God all things work together for good. After
mentioning then this great blessing, one which far exceeds man’s nature,
since to many this seemed even past belief, he draws a proof of it from
past blessings, in these words, “to them who are called according to
His <span id="fr_1448"></span>[1449](#fn_1448.md) purpose.” Now consider,
he means, from the calling, for instance, what I have just said. Why
then did He not from the first call all? or why not Paul himself as soon
as the rest? Does it not seem that the deferring was harmful? But it was
still by the event shown to be for the best. The purpose he here
mentions, however, that he might not ascribe everything to the calling;
since in this way both Greeks and Jews would be sure to cavil. For if
the calling alone were sufficient, how came it that all were not saved?
Hence he says, that it is not the calling alone, but the purpose of
those called too, that works the salvation. For the calling was not
forced upon them, nor compulsory. All then were called, but all did not
obey the call.

<span id="vii.xvii-p8"></span>[Rom.
8.29](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#029.md)<span id="vii.xvii-p8.1"></span>.
“For whom He did foreknow, He also did predestinate to be conformed to
the Image of His Son.”

<span id="vii.xvii-p9"></span>See what superb honor! for what the
Only-begotten was by Nature, this they also have become by grace. And
still he was not satisfied with this calling of them conformed thereto,
but even adds another point, “that He might be the first-born.” And even
here he does not come to a pause, but again after this he proceeds to
mention another point, “Among many brethren.” So wishing to use all
means of setting the relationship <span
id="fr_1449"></span>[1450](#fn_1449.md) in a clear light. Now all these
things you are to take as said of the Incarnation. <span
id="fr_1450"></span>[1451](#fn_1450.md) For according to the Godhead He is
Only-begotten. See, what great things He hath given unto us! Doubt not
then about the future. For he showeth even upon other grounds His
concern for us by saying, that things were fore-ordered <span
id="fr_1451"></span>[1452](#fn_1451.md) in this way from the beginning. For
men have to derive from things their conceptions about them, but to God
these things have been long determined upon, <span
id="fr_1452"></span>[1453](#fn_1452.md) and from of old He bare good-will
toward us (<span class="Greek"><span id="vii.xvii-p13.1"></span>πρὸς
ἡμἅς διέκειτο</span>), he says.

<span id="vii.xvii-p14"></span>[Rom.
8.30](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#030.md)<span id="vii.xvii-p14.1"></span>.
“Moreover whom He did predestinate, them He also called; and whom He
called, them He also justified.”

<span id="vii.xvii-p15"></span>Now He justified them by the regeneration
of the laver. “And whom He justified, them He also glorified” by the
gift, by the adoption.

<span id="vii.xvii-p16"></span>[Rom.
8.31](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#031.md)<span id="vii.xvii-p16.1"></span>.
“What shall we then say to these things?”

<span id="vii.xvii-p17"></span>As if he should say, Let me then hear no
more about the dangers and the malicious devices from every quarter. For
even if some disbelieve the things to come, still they have not a word
to say against the good things that have already taken place; as, for
instance, the friendship of God towards thee from the first, the
justifying, the glory. And yet these things He gave thee by means
seemingly distressing. And those things which you thought to be
disgracing, the Cross, scourges, bonds, these are what have set the
whole world aright. As then by what Himself suffered, though of aspect
forbidding in man’s eye, even by these He effected the liberty and
salvation of the whole race; so also is He wont to do in regard to those
things which thou endurest, turning thy sufferings unto glory and renown
for thee. “If God be for us, who can be against us?”

<span id="vii.xvii-p18"></span>Why, it may be said, who is there that is
not against us? Why the world is against us, both kings and peoples,
both relations and countrymen. Yet these that be against us, so far are
they from thwarting us at all, that even without their will they become
to us the causes of crowns, and procurers of countless blessings, in
that God’s wisdom turneth their plots unto our salvation and glory. See
how really no one is against us! For it was this which gave new lustre
to Job, the fact that the devil was in arms against him. For the devil
moved at once friends against him, his wife against him, and wounds, and
servants, and a thousand other machinations. And it turned out that none
of them was against him on the whole. And yet this was no great thing to
him, though it was great in itself, but what is a far greater thing is,
that it turned out that they were all for him. For since God was for
him, even things seemingly against him all became for him. And this
happened with the Apostles also, inasmuch as both the Jews, and they of
the Gentiles, and false brethren, and rulers, and peoples, and famines,
and poverty, and ten thousand things were against them; and yet nothing
was against them. For the things which made them the most bright and
conspicuous, and great in the sight both of God and of men, were these.
Just reflect then what a word Paul hath uttered about the faithful, and
those who are truly (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xvii-p18.1"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xvii-p18.2"></span>κριβὥς</span>) crucified, such as not even
the Emperor with his diadem can achieve. For against him there are
abundance of barbarians that arm themselves, and of enemies that invade,
and of bodyguards that plot, and of subjects many that oftentimes are
ever and anon rebelling, and thousands of other things. But against the
faithful who taketh good heed unto God’s laws, neither man, nor devil,
nor aught besides, can stand! For if you take away his money, you have
become the procurer of a reward to him. If you speak ill of him, by the
evil report he gains fresh lustre in God’s sight. If you cast him into
starvation, the more will his glory and his reward be. If (what seems
the most severe stroke of all) you give him over to death, you are
twining a crown of martyrdom about him. <span
id="fr_1453"></span>[1454](#fn_1453.md) What then is equivalent to this way
of life, being that against which nothing can be done, but even they
that seem to devise mischief are no less of service to him than
benefactors? This is why he says, “If God be for us, who can be against
us?” Next, not being satisfied with what he had already said, the
greatest sign of His love for us, and that which he always is dwelling
over, that he sets down here also; I mean, the slaying of His Son. For
He did not only justify us, he means, and glorify us, and make us
conformed to that Image, but not even His Son did He spare for thee. And
therefore he proceeds to say,

<span id="vii.xvii-p20"></span>[Rom.
8.32](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#032.md)<span id="vii.xvii-p20.1"></span>.
“He that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how
shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?”

<span id="vii.xvii-p21"></span>And here the words he uses are
high-wrought (<span class="Greek"><span id="vii.xvii-p21.1"></span>μεθ᾽
ὑτερβολἥς</span>) and exceedingly warm, to show his love. How then is He
to neglect us, in whose behalf “He spared not His own Son, but delivered
Him up for us all?” For reflect what goodness it is not to spare even
His own Son, but to give Him up, and to give Him up for all, and those
worthless, and unfeeling, and enemies, and blasphemers. “How then shall
He not with Him also freely give us all things? What he means then is
much as follows; If He gave His own Son, and not merely gave Him, but
gave Him to death, why doubt any more about the rest, since thou hast
the Master? why be dubious about the chattels, when thou hast the Lord?
For He that gave the greater thing to His enemies, how shall He do else
than give the lesser things to His friends?

<span id="vii.xvii-p22"></span>[Rom.
8.33](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#033.md)<span id="vii.xvii-p22.1"></span>.
“Who shall lay anything to the charge of God’s elect?”

<span id="vii.xvii-p23"></span>Here he is against those who say, that
faith is no profit, and will not believe the complete change. (i.e. in
baptism see p. 349.) And see how swiftly he stops their mouths, by the
worthiness of Him that elected. He does not say, “Who shall lay anything
to the charge of God’s” servants? or of God’s faithful ones? but “of
God’s elect?” And election is a sign of virtue. For if when a
horse-breaker has selected colts fit for the race, no one can find fault
with them, but he would get laughed at who should find fault; much more
when God selecteth souls are they that “lay any charge against” them
deserving of laughter.

<span id="vii.xvii-p24"></span>“It is God that justifieth.”

<span id="vii.xvii-p25"></span>[Rom.
8.34](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#034.md)<span id="vii.xvii-p25.1"></span>.
“Who is He that condemneth?

<span id="vii.xvii-p26"></span>He does not say, it is God that forgave
our sins, but what is much greater, “It is God that justifieth.” For
when the Judge’s sentence declares us just, and a Judge such as that
too, what signifieth the accuser? Hence neither is it right to fear
temptations, for God is for us, and hath shown it by what He hath done;
nor again Jewish triflings, for He has both elected and justified us,
and the wondrous thing is that it was also by the death of His Son that
He did so. Who then is to condemn us, since God crowns us, and Christ
was put to death for us, and not only was put to death, but also after
this intercedeth for us? <span id="fr_1454"></span>[1455](#fn_1454.md)

<span id="vii.xvii-p28"></span>For, “It is Christ,” he says, “that died,
yea rather, that is risen from the dead, Who is at the right hand of
God, Who also maketh intercession for us.”

<span id="vii.xvii-p29"></span>For though seen now in His own dignity,
He hath not left caring for us, but even “maketh intercession for us,”
and still keepeth up the same love. For He was not contented with being
put to death alone. And this is a sign for the most part of very great
love, to be doing not only what falls to His lot, but also to address
Another on this behalf. For this is all he meant to signify by the
interceding, using a way of speaking better suited to man, and more
condescending, that he might point out love. Since unless we take the
words, “He spared not,” also with the same understanding, many
inconsistencies will come of it. And that you may see that such is the
point he is aiming at, after first saying, that He “is at the Right
Hand,” he next proceeds to say, that He “maketh intercession for us,”
when he had shown an equality of honor and rank, so that hence it may
appear that the Intercession is not a sign of inferiority, <span
id="fr_1455"></span>[1456](#fn_1455.md) but of love only. For being Life
itself (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xvii-p30.1"></span>αὐτοζωή</span>) ([Ps. xxxvi.
9](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#009)<span id="vii.xvii-p30.2"></span>..md),
and a Well of good things of every kind, and with the same power as the
Father, both to raise up the dead and to quicken them, and do all
besides that He doth, how could He need to be a suppliant in order to
help us? (<span id="vii.xvii-p30.3"></span>[John
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#019.md),
[21](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#021.md),
[36](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#036)<span id="vii.xvii-p30.4"></span>..md)
He that of His own power set free those who were given over and
condemned, even from that condemnation; and made them righteous, and
sons, and led them to the very highest honors, and brought to pass
things which had never been hoped for: how should He, after having
achieved all this, and having shown our nature on the King’s throne,
require to be a suppliant to do the easier things? (<span
id="vii.xvii-p30.5"></span>[Acts vii.
55](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#055.md)<span id="vii.xvii-p30.6"></span>;
[Heb. x. 12](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#012.md)<span
id="vii.xvii-p30.7"></span>; [Rev. vii.
17](../../../bib/kjv/rev007.htm#017)<span id="vii.xvii-p30.8"></span>..md)
You see how it is shown by every argument, that there is no other reason
for his having mentioned intercession, save to show the warmth and
vigorousness of His love for us; for the Father also is represented to
us as beseeching men to be reconciled to Him. “For we are ambassadors of
Christ, as though God did beseech you by us.” ([2 Cor. v.
20](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#020)<span id="vii.xvii-p30.9"></span>..md)
Still, though God beseecheth, and men are “ambassadors in Christ’s
stead” to men, we do not understand on that account anything done
unworthy of that dignity; but one thing only do we gather from all that
is told us, namely, the intenseness of the love. This then let us do
here also. If then the Spirit even “maketh intercession for us with
groanings that cannot be uttered,” and Christ died and intercedeth for
us, and the Father “spared not His own Son” for thee, and elected thee,
and justified thee, why be afraid any more? Or why tremble when enjoying
such great love, and having such great interest taken in thee? In this
way then, after showing His great providence over us from the first, he
afterwards brings out what comes next in a bold style, and does not say,
ye ought also to love Him, but, as if grown enthusiastic at this
unspeakable Providence over us, he says,

<span id="vii.xvii-p31"></span>[Rom.
8.35](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#035.md)<span id="vii.xvii-p31.1"></span>.
“Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?”

<span id="vii.xvii-p32"></span>And he does not say of God, so
indifferent is it to him whether he mentions the Name of Christ or of
God. “Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or
nakedness, or peril, or sword?” Observe the blessed Paul’s judgment. For
he does not mention the things that we are daily getting taken by, love
of money and desire of glory and the thraldom of anger, but things that
are far more enthralling than these, and of power to put a force <span
id="fr_1456"></span>[1457](#fn_1456.md) upon nature itself, and to wrench
open the sternness of the resolution many times even against our will,
are what he puts down here, tribulations and distresses. For even if the
things mentioned are easy to tell up, still each single word has in it
thousands of lines of temptation. For when he says, tribulation, he
mentions prisons and bonds, and calumnies, and banishments, and all the
other hardships, so in one word running through an ocean of dangers
without stint, and exhibiting to us, in fact by a single word, all the
evils that men meet with. Yet still he dares them all! Wherefore he
brings them forward in the shape of questions, as if it was
incontrovertible that nothing could move a person so beloved, and who
had enjoyed so much providence over him. Then that this might not seem
as if he had forgotten himself, he brings in the Prophet also, who
declared this before, a long while ago and saith,

<span id="vii.xvii-p34"></span>[Rom.
8.36](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#036.md)<span id="vii.xvii-p34.1"></span>.
“For Thy sake we are killed all the day long, we are accounted as sheep
for the slaughter.” ([Ps. xliv.
22](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#022)<span id="vii.xvii-p34.2"></span>..md)

<span id="vii.xvii-p35"></span>That is, we are exposed to all to be evil
entreated of them. But yet against so many and so great dangers and
these recent horrors, the object of our conflicts is given as a
sufficient consolation, or rather not sufficient only, but even much
more. For it is not for men, nor for any other of the things of this
life that we suffer, but for the King (he says) of the universe. But
this is not the only crown, for he encircles them with another besides,
and that varied and manifold. Since then, as they were men they could
not have deaths without number to undergo, he shows that in this way the
prize is none the less. For even if by nature it were fated to die once,
by choice God hath granted us to suffer this every day, if we be so
minded. Whence it is plain that we shall depart with as many crowns as
we have lived days, or rather with many more. For it is possible in a
day to die not once alone or twice, but many times. For he who is always
ready unto this, keeps continually receiving a full reward. This then is
what the Psalmist (Π<span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xvii-p35.1"></span>ροφήτης</span>) hints at, when he says, “all
the day.” And for this reason the Apostle also brought him before them
to rouse them up the more. For if, he means, those in the old
dispensation, who had the land as their reward, and the other things
which come to a close along with this life, did so look down upon the
present life and the temptations and dangers of it, what pardon should
we find if we deal so languidly after the promise of Heaven, and the
Kingdom above, and its unutterable blessings, so as not to come even up
to the same measure as they? And this he does not say indeed, but leaves
it to his hearers’ consciences, and is satisfied with the quotation
alone. He shows too that their bodies become a sacrifice, and that we
must not be disturbed or troubled at God having so ordered it. And he
exhorts them in other ways besides. For to prevent any from saying that
he is merely philosophizing here before having any experience of
realities, he adds, “we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter,”
meaning the daily deaths of the Apostles. You see his courage and his
goodness. For as they, he means, when slaughtered make no resistance, so
neither do we. But since the feebleness of the mind of man, even after
so great things, was afraid of the multitude of temptations, see how he
again rouses the hearer, and gives him a lofty and exulting spirit, by
saying,

<span id="vii.xvii-p36"></span>[Rom.
8.37](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#037.md)<span id="vii.xvii-p36.1"></span>.
“Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him that
loved us.”

<span id="vii.xvii-p37"></span>For what is indeed wonderful is this, not
that we are conquerors only, but that we are so by the very things meant
as plots against us. And we are not merely conquerors, but we are “more
than conquerors,” that is, are so with ease, without toil and labor. For
without undergoing the real things, by only setting our mind aright, we
raise our trophies against our enemies. And with good reason. For it is
God that striveth together with us. Do not then be doubtful, if though
beaten we get the better of our beaters, if driven out we overcome our
persecutors, if dying we put the living to fight. For when you take the
power and also the love of God into account, there is nothing to prevent
these wondrous and strange things from coming to pass, and that victory
the most advantageous should shine upon us. For they did not merely
conquer, but in a wondrous way, and so that one might learn that those
who plotted against them had a war not against men, but against that
invincible Might. See the Jews then with these among them, and at a loss
quite, and saying, “What are we to do to these men?” ([Acts iv.
16](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#016)<span id="vii.xvii-p37.1"></span>..md)
For it is marvellous indeed, that though they had hold of them and had
got them liable to their courts, and imprisoned them and beat them, they
were yet at a loss and in perplexity, as they got overcome by the very
things whereby they expected to conquer. And neither kings nor people,
nor ranks of demons, nor the devil himself, had power to get the better
of them, but were all overcome at a very great disadvantage, finding
that all they planned against them became for them. And therefore he
says, “we are more than conquerors.” For this was a new rule of victory
for men to prevail by their adversaries, and in no instance to be
overcome, but to go forth to these struggles as if they themselves had
the issue in their own hands.

<span id="vii.xvii-p38"></span>[Rom.
8:38](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#038.md),
[39](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#039.md)<span id="vii.xvii-p38.1"></span>.
“For I am persuaded, that neither death nor life, nor angels, nor
principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor
height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us
from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.”

<span id="vii.xvii-p39"></span>These are great things here mentioned.
But the reason we do not enter into them is, because we have not so
great love. Yet still though they are great, as he wished to show that
they were nothing beside the love wherewith he was loved of God; after
it he then places his own, lest he should seem to be saying great things
about himself. And what he says is somewhat of this kind. Why speak, he
means, of things present, and evils inherited in this life? For even if
a person were to tell me of things to come, and of powers; of things,
such as death and life; of powers, such as angels and archangels, and
all the superior orders of beings; even these would be little to me
compared with the love of Christ. For even if a person were to threaten
me with that future death to which there is no death, to separate me
from Christ, nor if he promised the life without end, would I agree to
it. Why mention kings here below and consuls? and this one or that? for
if you tell me of angels, or all the powers above, or all existing
things, or all that are to come, they are all small to me, both those in
the earth, and those in heaven, and those under the earth, and those
above heaven, compared to this charm. Then as though these were not
enough to set before them the strong desire which he had, he gives a
being to others again of like magnitude, and says, “nor any other
creation.” And what he means is nearly this, even if there were any
other creation as great as the visible, and as great as the
intelligible, <span id="fr_1457"></span>[1458](#fn_1457.md) none of them
could part me from that love. This he says not as if the Angels
attempted it, or the other Powers, far from it, but as wishing to show
quite to the utmost the charm he had toward Christ. For Christ he loved
not for the things of Christ, but for His sake the things that were His,
and to Him alone he looked, and one thing he feared, and that was
falling from his love for Him. For this thing was in itself more
dreadful than hell, as to abide in it was more desirable than the
Kingdom.

<span id="vii.xvii-p41"></span>What then should we now deserve, when he
is found not to esteem even the things in Heaven as compared with the
desire for Christ, and we set more store by things of mire and clay than
by Christ? And he out of desire of Him would take up with falling into
hell, and being banished from the Kingdom, if the choice between the two
were put to him: but we are not even above the present life. Are we
worthy then to touch his very shoes, when we have come to be so far
short of his largeness of mind? For he for Christ’s sake does not think
anything even of a kingdom; but we think slightingly of Himself, but
things of His we make great account of. And would it were of things of
His. But now it is not even this; but with a Kingdom held out to us, we
let that alone, and keep pursuing shadows and dreams all our days. And
yet God in His love toward man and exceeding gentleness, hath done the
same as if an affectionate father should, on his son’s becoming
disinclined to a continual stay with him, manage to bring this about in
another way. For since we have not the right feeling of desire after
Him, He keeps putting divers other things before us, so as to hold us to
Himself. Yet not even for this do we abide with Him, but we keep
springing off to childish playthings. Not so Paul, but like a noble
spirited child, who is open and attached to his father, he seeks only
after the Father’s presence, and other things he sets not so much store
by; or rather, it is much more than a child. For he does not value the
Father and things that are His at the same rate, but when he looks to
the Father, he counts them nothing, but would choose rather to be
chastised and beaten, so he was with Him, than to be apart from Him and
indulge his ease. Let us then shudder, all of us that do not even feel
above money for the sake of Christ, or rather such of us as do not feel
above it for our own sakes. For it was Paul alone who suffered in good
earnest all things for Christ’s sake, not for the sake of the kingdom,
or his own honor, but owing to his affection to Him. But as for us,
neither Christ nor the things of Christ draw us from the things of this
life; but as serpents, or snakes, or swine, or even as all of them at
once, so do we keep dragging on in the mire. For wherein are we better
than those brutes, when with so many and such great examples before us
we still keep bowing down, and have not the heart to look up to Heaven
for ever so little a time? Yet did God give up even His Son. But thou
wilt not so much as share thy bread with Him, Who was given up for thee,
Who was slain for thee. The Father for thy sake spared not Him, and this
too when He was indeed His Son, but thou doest not look upon Him even
when pining with starvation, and this too when thou shouldest but spend
of His own, and spend it too for thy own good! What can be worse than
such a breach of law as this? He was given up for thee, He was slain for
thee, He goeth about in hunger for thee, it is of His own thou shouldest
give, that thou mayest thyself get the gain, and still thou dost not
give! What sort of stone is there than which these are not more
senseless, who in despite of such great inducements, continue in this
diabolical cruel-heartedness? For He was not satisfied even with death
and the Cross only, but He took up with becoming poor also, and a
stranger, and a beggar, and naked, and being thrown into prison, and
undergoing sickness, that so at least He might call thee off. If thou
wilt not requite Me, He says, as having suffered for thee, show mercy on
Me for My poverty. And if thou are not minded to pity Me for My poverty,
do for My disease be moved, for My imprisonment be softened. And if even
these things make thee not charitable, for the easiness of the request
comply with Me. For it is no costly gift I ask, but bread and lodging,
and words of comfort; but if even after this thou still continuest
unsubdued, still for the Kingdom’s sake be improved for the rewards
which I have promised. Hast thou then no regard even for these? yet
still for very nature’s sake be softened at seeing Me naked, and
remember that nakedness wherewith I was naked on the Cross for thee; or,
if not this, yet that wherewith I am now naked through the poor. I was
then bound for thee, nay, still am so for thee, that whether moved by
the former ground or the latter, thou mightest be minded to show some
pity. I fasted for thee, again I am hungry for thee. I was athirst when
hanging on the Cross, I am athirst also through the poor, that by the
former as also by the latter I may draw thee to Myself, and make thee
charitable to thine own salvation. Hence also of thee that owest Me the
requital of benefits without number, I make not demand as of one that
oweth, but crown thee as one that favoreth Me, and a kingdom do I give
thee for these small things. For I do not say so much as put an end to
My poverty, or give Me riches, and yet I did become poor for thee; yet
still I ask for bread and clothing, and a small solace for My hunger.
And if I be thrown into prison, I do not insist upon thy loosing My
bonds and setting Me free, but one thing only do I seek after, that thou
wouldest visit Me, Who was (or am) bound for thee, and I shall have
received favor enough, and for this only will I give thee Heaven. And
yet I delivered thee from most galling bonds, but for Me it is quite
enough, if thou wilt but visit Me when in prison. For I am able indeed
to crown thee even without all this; yet I would fain be a debtor to
thee, that the crown may give thee some feeling of confidence. This is
why, though I am able to support Myself, I come about begging, and stand
beside thy door, and stretch out Mine hand, since My wish is to be
supported by thee. For I love thee exceedingly, and so desire to eat at
thy table, which is the way with those that love a person. And I glory
(<span id="vii.xvii-p41.1"></span>[John xv.
8](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#008)<span id="vii.xvii-p41.2"></span>.md) in
this. And when the whole world are spectators, then am I to herald thee
forth, and in the hearing of all men to display thee as My supporter.
Yet we, when we are supported by any one, feel ashamed, and cover our
faces; but He, as loving us exceedingly, even if we hold our peace, will
then tell out what we did with much praise, and is not ashamed to say,
that when Himself was naked we clothed Him, and fed Him when hungry. Let
us then lay all these things to heart, and not be contented with passing
mere praises upon them, but let us even accomplish what I have been
speaking of. For what is the good of these applauses and clamors? I
demand one thing only of you, and that is the display of them in real
action, the obedience of deeds. This is my praise, this your gain, this
gives me more lustre than a diadem. When you have left the Church then,
this is the crown that you should make for me and for you, through the
hand of the poor; that both in the present life we may be nourished with
a goodly hope, and after we have departed to the life to come, we may
attain to those good things without number, to which may all of us
attain by the grace and love toward man, etc.

<span id="vii.xvii-p19"></span> Chrys. apprehends well the practical
purpose for which the apostle introduced [Rom.
8.28-30](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#028.md)<span
id="vii.xvii-p19.1"></span>. Notwithstanding all the imperfections of
the Christian’s spiritual life ([Rom.
8:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#026.md),
[27](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#027)<span id="vii.xvii-p19.2"></span>.md)
and the trials which have been so fully described ([Rom.
8.1-24](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#001.md)<span
id="vii.xvii-p19.3"></span>) we have the assurance that all these things
are working in accordance with God’s gracious plan for his ultimate
good. In passing over from the idea of believers as those who love God
to its counterpart that they are those called according to His purpose
(not to be taken of the *believer’s* purpose, as Chrys.) the apostle
develops from this idea of *purpose* a series of conceptions designed to
emphasize the believer’s security. “You who love God can be sure of the
outcome of all suffering in good for you are included in God’s purpose
which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord.” (<span
id="vii.xvii-p19.4"></span>[Eph. iii.
11](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#011)<span id="vii.xvii-p19.5"></span>..md)
You have all the strength and solidity of God’s eternal plan on your
side. When the divine purpose of redemption was before the mind of God
in eternity, you were the prospective participants in it, as truly as
you now are the real participants. What you are God from eternity
intended you to be. The stability of his immutable counsel is pledged to
you.”—G.B.S.

which is so condensed in form, may be paraphrased thus: “Who shall lay
anything to the charge of God’s elect? No one shall. Why? Because their
justifier is God himself. No one may accuse whom He acquits. Who, then,
can appear against them and condemn them? No one can, for it is no less
a person than Christ who died and rose on their behalf.”—G.B.S.
