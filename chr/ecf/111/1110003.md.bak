<span id="iv-p2"></span>————————————

<span id="iv-p3"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv-p3.1"></span>The</span> present volume of St. Chrysostom on the
Acts of the Apostles has been delayed for some time by the difficulty of
fixing the Text. Some farther account of the grounds on which this has
been done will be given in the Preface to Part II. (vid. *infra.*) It
may suffice for the present to say, that these Homilies appear to have
been less carefully reported than usual, and published without a
revision by the Author. The printed text was formed for the most part
(Erasmus’s Latin Version entirely) from a manuscript, said to be of the
tenth century, in which these Homilies are given in a very different
form, evidently the work of a later hand, and intended to make them read
more smoothly. The earlier text, shown to be such by internal evidence,
and alone followed in the Catena and all other ancient extracts and
compilations, is preserved in other <span class="c14"><span
id="iv-p3.2"></span>mss.</span> and appears to have been in general
disregarded by former editors, from its difficulty. The Translation was
originally made from Savile’s Text, by the Rev. J. <span
class="c14"><span id="iv-p3.3"></span>Walker</span>, M.A. of Brasenose
College, and the Rev. J. <span class="c14"><span
id="iv-p3.4"></span>Sheppard</span>, M.A. of Oriel College, Oxford. The
Editors are much indebted to the Rev. H. <span class="c14"><span
id="iv-p3.5"></span>Browne</span>, M.A. of Corpus Christi College,
Cambridge, who has restored the Text and corrected the Translation
accordingly, the difference being frequently so great as to require a
passage to be translated anew. He has likewise undertaken to prepare the
Greek Text for publication, and to supply the prefatory matter. Many
passages will still be found imperfect and unsatisfactory, but it has
been thought better to leave them evidently so, than to resort to
uncertain conjectures. A few conjectural emendations, however, have been
admitted into the Text, and many more suggested.
