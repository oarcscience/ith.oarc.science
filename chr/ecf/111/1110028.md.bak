<span id="vi.xxiii-p1"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vi.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Homily XXIII.</span>

<span id="vi.xxiii-p2"></span>[Acts
10:23](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#023.md),
[24](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#024.md)<span id="vi.xxiii-p2.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xxiii-p3"></span>“Then called he them in, and lodged them.
And on the morrow Peter went away with them, and certain brethren from
Joppa accompanied him. And the morrow after they entered into Cæsarea.
And Cornelius waited for them, and had called together his kinsmen and
near friends.”

<span id="vi.xxiii-p4"></span>“<span class="c14"><span
id="vi.xxiii-p4.1"></span>He</span>” called them in, and lodged them.”
Good, that first he gives the men friendly treatment, after the fatigue
of their journey, and makes them at home with him; “and on the morrow,”
sets out with them.” And certain accompany him: this too as Providence
ordered it, that they should be witnesses afterwards when Peter would
need to justify himself. “And Cornelius was waiting for them, and had
called together his kinsmen and near friends.” This is the part of a
friend, this the part of a devout man, that where such blessings are
concerned, he takes care that his near friends shall be made partakers
of all. Of course (his “near” friends), those in whom he had ever full
confidence; fearing, with such an interest at stake, to entrust the
matter to others. In my opinion, it was by Cornelius himself that both
friends and kinsmen had been brought to a better mind. “And as Peter was
coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped
him.” ([Acts 10.25](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#025.md)<span
id="vi.xxiii-p4.2"></span>.) This, both to teach the others, and by way
of giving thanks to God, and showing his own humility: thereby making it
plain, that though he had been commanded, yet in himself he had great
piety. What then did Peter? “But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up; I
myself also am a man.” ([Acts
10.26](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#026.md)<span
id="vi.xxiii-p4.3"></span>.) Do you mark how, before all else (the
Apostles) teach them this lesson, not to think great things of them?
“And as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that were come
together. And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful
thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto one of
another nation; but God hath showed me that I should not call any man
common or unclean.” ([Acts 10:27](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#027.md),
[28](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#028)<span id="vi.xxiii-p4.4"></span>..md)
Observe, he straightway speaks of the mercy of God, and points out to
them that it is a great grace that God has shown them. Observe also how
while he utters great things, at the same time he speaks modestly. For
he does not say, We, being men who do not deign to keep company with any
(such), have come to you: but what says he? “Ye know”—God commanded
this <span id="fr_553"></span>[554](#fn_553.md) —“that it is against law to
keep company with, or come unto, one of another nation.” Then he goes on
to say, “And to me God has shown”—this he says, that none may account
the thanks due to him—“that I should call no man”—that it may not look
like obsequiousness to him, “no human being,” says he—“common or
unclean.” <span id="fr_554"></span>[555](#fn_554.md) ([Acts
10.29](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#029.md)<span
id="vi.xxiii-p6.4"></span>.) “Wherefore also”—that they may not think
the affair a breach of the law on his part, nor (Cornelius) suppose that
because he was in a station of command therfore he had complied, but
that they may ascribe all to God,—“wherefore also I came without
gainsaying as soon as I was sent for:” (though) not only to keep
company, but even to come unto (him) was not permitted. “I ask
therefore, for what intent ye have sent for me.” Already Peter had heard
the whole matter from the soldiers also, but he wishes them first to
confess, and to make them amenable to the Faith. What then does
Cornelius? He does not say, Why, did not the soldiers tell thee? but
observe again, how humbly he speaks. For he says, “From the fourth day I
was fasting until this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house,
and, behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing, and said,
Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are come up for a
memorial before God. And at the ninth hour,” he says, “I was praying.”
([Acts 10:30](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#030.md),
[31](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#031)<span id="vi.xxiii-p6.5"></span>..md)
It seems to me, that this man had also fixed for himself set times of a
life under stricter rule, and on certain days. <span
id="fr_555"></span>[556](#fn_555.md) For this is why he he says, “From the
fourth day.” <span id="fr_556"></span>[557](#fn_556.md) See how great a
thing prayer is! When he advanced in piety, then the Angel appears to
him. “From the fourth day:” i.e. of the week; not “four days ago.” For,
“on the morrow Peter went away with them, and on the morrow after they
entered into Cæsarea:” this is one day: and the day on which the persons
sent came (to Joppa) one day: and on the third (the Angel) appeared: so
that there are two days after that on which (Cornelius) had been
praying. “And, behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing:” he
does not say, an Angel, so unassuming is he: “and said, Cornelius, thy
prayer is heard, and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of
God. Send therefore to Joppa, and call hither Simon, whose surname is
Peter: he is lodged in the house of one Simon a tanner by the seaside:
who, when he cometh, shall speak unto thee. Immediately therefore I sent
to thee; and thou hast well done that thou art come. Now therefore are
we all here present before God, to hear all things that are commanded
thee of God.” ([Acts 10.31-33](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#031.md)<span
id="vi.xxiii-p8.4"></span>.) *(b)* See <span
id="fr_557"></span>[558](#fn_557.md) what faith, what piety! He knew that
it was no word of man that Peter spake, when he said, “God hath shown
me.” Then says the man, “We are present to hear all things that are
commanded thee of the Lord. *(a)* Therefore it was that Peter asked,
“For what intent have ye sent for me?” on purpose that he might so speak
these very words. *(d)* “Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a
truth I perceive that God is no respector of persons: but in every
nation he that feareth Him, and worketh righteousness, is acceptable to
him.” ([Acts 10:34](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#034.md),
[35](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#035)<span id="vi.xxiii-p9.5"></span>..md)
That is, be he uncircumcised or circumcised. *(c)* This also Paul
declaring, saith, “For there is no respect of persons with God.” <span
id="fr_558"></span>[559](#fn_558.md) ([Rom. ii.
11](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#011)<span id="vi.xxiii-p10.10"></span>..md)
*(e)* What then? (it may be asked) is the man yonder in Persia
acceptable to Him? If he be worthy, in this regard he is acceptable,
that it should be granted him to be brought unto faith (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxiii-p10.11"></span>τᾥ καταξιωθἥναι τῆς
πίστεως</span>). The Eunuch from Ethiopia He overlooked not. “What shall
one say then of the religious men who have been overlooked?” It is not
the case, that any (such) ever was overlooked. But what he says is to
this effect, that God rejects no man. <span
id="fr_559"></span>[560](#fn_559.md) “In every nation, he that feareth God
and worketh righteousness:” (by righteousness) he means, all virtue.
Mark, how he subdues all elation of mind in him. That (the Jews) may not
seem to be in the condition of persons cast off (he adds), “The word
which He sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus
Christ: He is Lord of all ([Acts
10.36](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#036.md)<span
id="vi.xxiii-p11.3"></span>): this he says also for the sake of those
present (of the Jews), that He may persuade them also: this is why he
forces Cornelius to speak. “He,” saith he, “is Lord of all.” But observe
at the very outset, “The word,” says he, “which He sent unto the
children of Israel;” he gives them the preëminence. Then he adduces
(these Gentiles) themselves as witnesses: “ye know,” says he, “the
matter which came to pass throughout all Judea, beginning at
Galilee”—then he confirms it from this also—“after the baptism which
John preached” ([Acts 10.37](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#037.md)<span
id="vi.xxiii-p11.4"></span>)—“even Jesus of Nazareth, how God anointed
Him with the Holy Ghost and with power.” ([Acts
10.38](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#038.md)<span
id="vi.xxiii-p11.5"></span>.) He does not mean, Ye know Jesus, for they
did not know Him, but he speaks of the things done by Him: <span
id="fr_560"></span>[561](#fn_560.md) “Who went about doing good, and
healing all that were oppressed of the devil: by this <span
id="fr_561"></span>[562](#fn_561.md) he shows that many cases of lost
senses or paralyzed limbs are the devil’s work, and a wrench given to
the body by him: as also Christ said. “For God was with Him.” Again,
lowly terms. “And we are witnesses of all things which He did, both in
the country of the Jews, and in Jerusalem” ([Acts
10.39](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#039.md)<span
id="vi.xxiii-p13.16"></span>): both “we,” saith he, and ye. Then the
Passion, and the reason why they do not believe: “Whom also they slew,
and hanged on a tree. Him God raised up the third day, and showed Him
openly; not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before of God,
even to us, who did eat and drink with Him after He rose from the dead.”
([Acts 10:40](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#040.md),
[41](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#041.md)<span
id="vi.xxiii-p13.17"></span>.) This is a proof of the Resurrection. “And
he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it is He
which was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and dead.” ([Acts
10.42](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#042.md)<span
id="vi.xxiii-p13.18"></span>.) This is great. Then he adduces the
testimony from the Prophets: “To Him give all the prophets witness, that
through His name, whosoever believeth in Him shall receive remission of
sins.” ([Acts 10.43](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#043.md)<span
id="vi.xxiii-p13.19"></span>.) This is a proof of that which was about
to be: this is the reason why he here cites the Prophets.

<span id="vi.xxiii-p14"></span>But let us look over again what relates
to Cornelius. (Recapitulation.) He sent, it says, to Joppa to fetch
Peter. “He was waiting for him,” etc; see how fully he believed that
Peter would certainly come: (*b*) “and <span
id="fr_562"></span>[563](#fn_562.md) fell down at his feet, and worshipped
him.” ([Acts 10:24](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#024.md),
[25](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#025)<span id="vi.xxiii-p15.2"></span>..md)
(*a*) Mark how on every side it is shown how worthy he is! (So) the
Eunuch there desired Philip to come up and sit in the chariot ([Acts
8.31](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#031.md)<span
id="vi.xxiii-p15.3"></span>), although not knowing who he was, upon no
other introduction (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxiii-p15.4"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxiii-p15.5"></span>παγγελίας</span>) than that given by the
Prophet. But here Cornelius fell at his feet. (*c*) “Stand up, I myself
also am a man.” ([Acts 10.26](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#026.md)<span
id="vi.xxiii-p15.6"></span>.) Observe how free from adulation his speech
is on all occasions, and how full of humility. “And conversing with him,
he came in.” (*a*) ([Acts 10.27](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#027.md)<span
id="vi.xxiii-p15.7"></span>.) Conversing about what? I suppose saying
these words: “I myself also am a man.” (*e*) Do you mark (Peter’s)
unassuming temper? He himself also shows that his coming is God’s doing:
“Ye know that it is unlawful for a man that is a Jew,” etc. ([Acts
10.28](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#028.md)<span
id="vi.xxiii-p15.8"></span>.) And why did he not speak of the linen
sheet? Observe Peter’s freedom from all vainglory: but, that he is sent
of God, this indeed he mentions; of the manner in which he was sent, he
speaks not at present; when the need has arisen, seeing he had said, “Ye
know that it is unlawful for a man that is a Jew to keep company with,
or to come unto, one of another nation,” he simply adds, “but to me God
hath shown,” etc. There is nothing of vainglory here. “All ye,” he says,
“know.” He makes their knowledge stand surety for him. But Cornelius
says, “We are present before God to hear all things that are commanded
thee of the Lord” ([Acts 10.33](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#033.md)<span
id="vi.xxiii-p15.9"></span>): not, Before man, but, “Before God.” This
is the way one ought to attend to God’s servants. Do you see his
awakened mind? do you see how worthy he was of all these things? “And
Peter,” it says, “opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that
God is no respecter of persons.” ([Acts
10.34](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#034.md)<span
id="vi.xxiii-p15.10"></span>.) This he said also by way of justifying
himself with the Jews then present. For, being at the point to commit
the Word to these (Gentiles), he first puts this by way of apology. What
then? Was He “a respecter of persons” beforetime? God forbid! For
beforetime likewise it was just the same: “Every one,” as he saith,
“that feareth Him, and worketh righteousness, would be acceptable to
Him.” As when Paul saith, “For when the Gentiles which have not the Law,
do by nature the things of the Law.” (<span
id="vi.xxiii-p15.11"></span>[Rom. ii.
14](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#014)<span id="vi.xxiii-p15.12"></span>..md)
“That feareth God and worketh righteousness:” he assumes <span
id="fr_563"></span>[564](#fn_563.md) both doctrine and manner of life: is
“accepted with Him;” for, if He did not overlook the Magi, nor the
Ethiopian, nor the thief, nor the harlot, much more them that work
righteousness, and are willing, shall He in anywise not overlook. “What
say you then to this, that there are likely persons (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxiii-p16.4"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxiii-p16.5"></span>πιεικεἵς</span>), men of
mild disposition, and yet they will not believe?” (Above, p. 149, note
2.) Lo, you have yourself named the cause: they will not. But besides
the likely person he here speaks of is not this sort of man, but the man
“that worketh righteousness:” that is, the man who in all points is
virtuous and irreproachable, when he has the fear of God as he ought to
have it. But whether a person be such, God only knows. See how this man
was acceptable: see how, as soon as he heard, he was persuaded. “Yes,
and now too,” say you, “every one would be persuaded, be who he may.”
But the signs that are now, are much greater than those, and more
wonderful.—Then Peter commences his teaching, and reserves for the Jews
the privilege of their birth. “The <span
id="fr_564"></span>[565](#fn_564.md) word,” he says, “which He sent unto
the children of Israel, preaching peace ([Acts
10.36](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#036.md)<span
id="vi.xxiii-p17.3"></span>), not bringing judgment. He is sent to the
Jews also: yet for all this He did not spare them. “Preaching peace
through Jesus Christ. He is Lord of all.” First he discourses of His
being Lord and in exceeding elevated terms, seeing he had to deal with a
soul more than commonly elevated, and that took all in with ardor. Then
he proves how He was Lord of all, from the things which He achieved
“throughout all Judea. For ye know,” saith he, “the matter which came to
pass throughout all Judea:” and, what is the wonderful part of it,
“beginning at Galilee: after the baptism which John preached.” ([Acts
10.37](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#037.md)<span
id="vi.xxiii-p17.4"></span>.) First he speaks of His success, and then
again he says concerning Him, “Jesus of Nazareth.” Why, what a
stumbling-block, this birthplace! “How <span
id="fr_565"></span>[566](#fn_565.md) God anointed Him with the Holy Ghost
and with power.” ([Acts 10.38](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#038.md)<span
id="vi.xxiii-p18.2"></span>.) Then again the proof—how does that
appear?—from the good that He did. “Who went about doing good, and
healing all that were oppressed of the devil:” and the greatness of the
power shown when He overcomes the devil; and the cause, “Because God was
with Him.” Therefore also the Jews spake thus: “We know that Thou art a
teacher come from God: for none can do these miracles except God be with
him.” ([John iii. 2](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#002.md)<span
id="vi.xxiii-p18.3"></span>.) Then, when he has shown that He was sent
from God, he next speaks of this, that He was slain: that thou mayest
not imagine <span id="fr_566"></span>[567](#fn_566.md) aught absurd. Seest
thou how far they are from hiding the Cross out of view, nay, that
together with the other circumstances they put also the manner? “Whom
also,” it says, “they slew by hanging on a tree. And gave Him,” it is
added, “to be made manifest not to all the people, but to witnesses
before ordained of God, even unto us:” and yet it was (Christ) Himself
that elected them; but this also he refers to God. “To the
before-ordained,” he says, “even to us, who did eat and drink with Him
after that He was risen from the dead.” ([Acts
10:39](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#039.md),
[41](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#041)<span id="vi.xxiii-p19.2"></span>..md)
See whence he fetches his assurance of the resurrection. What is the
reason that being risen he did no sign, but only ate and drank? Because
the Resurrection itself was a great sign, and of this nothing was so
much <span id="fr_567"></span>[568](#fn_567.md) a sign as the eating and
drinking. “To testify,” saith he—in a manner calculated to alarm—that
they may not have it in their power to fall back upon the excuse of
ignorance: and he does not say, “that He is the Son of God,” but, what
would most alarm them, “that it is He which is ordained of God, to be
the Judge of quick and dead.” ([Acts
10.42](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#042.md)<span
id="vi.xxiii-p20.4"></span>.) “To him give all the Prophets witness,”
etc. ([Acts 10.43](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#043.md)<span
id="vi.xxiii-p20.5"></span>.) When by the terror he has agitated them,
then he brings in the pardon, not spoken from himself but from the
Prophets. And what is terrifying is from him, what is mild from the
Prophets.

<span id="vi.xxiii-p21"></span>All ye that have received this
forgiveness, all ye to whom it has been vouchsafed to attain unto faith,
learn, I beseech you, the greatness of the Gift, and study not to be
insolent to your Benefactor. For we obtained forgiveness, not that we
should become worse, but to make us far better and more excellent. Let
none say that God is the cause of our evil doings, in that He did not
punish, nor take vengeance. If (as it is said) a ruler having taken a
murderer, lets him go, say, is he (not) <span
id="fr_568"></span>[569](#fn_568.md) judged to be the cause of the murders
afterwards committed? See then, how we expose God to the tongues of the
wicked. For what do they not say, what leave unuttered? “(God) Himself,”
say they, “allowed them; for he ought to have punished them as they
deserved, not to honor them, nor crown them, nor admit them to the
foremost privileges, but to punish and take vengeance upon them: but he
that, instead of this, honors them, has made them to be such as they
are.” Do not, I beseech and implore you, do not let any man utter such
speech as far as we are concerned. Better to be buried ten thousand
times over, than that God through us should be so spoken of! The Jews,
we read, said to (Christ) Himself, “Thou that destroyest the Temple, and
in three days buildest it up, come down from the Cross” ([Matt. xxvii.
40](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#040)<span id="vi.xxiii-p22.3"></span>.md):
and again, “If Thou be the Son of God:” but the reproaches here are more
grievous than those, that <span id="fr_569"></span>[570](#fn_569.md)
through us He should be called a teacher of wickedness! Let us cause the
very opposite to be said, by having our conversation worthy of Him that
calleth us, and (worthily) approaching to the baptism of adoption. For
great indeed is the might of baptism (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxiii-p23.4"></span>φωτίσματου</span>): it makes them quite other
men than they were, that partake of the gift; it does not let the men be
men (and nothing more). Make thou the Gentile (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxiii-p23.5"></span>τὸν ῞Ελληνα</span>), to believe that great is
the might of the Spirit, that it has new-moulded, that it has fashioned
thee anew. Why waitest thou for the last gasp, like a runaway slave,
like a malefactor, as though it were not thy duty to live unto God? Why
dost thou stand affected to Him, as if thou hadst in Him a ruthless,
cruel Master? What can be more heartless (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxiii-p23.6"></span>ψυχρότερον</span>), what more miserable, than
those who make that the time to receive baptism? God made thee a friend,
and vouchsafed thee all His good things, that thou mayest act the part
of a friend. Suppose you had done some man the greatest of wrongs, had
insulted him, and brought upon him disgraces without end, suppose you
had fallen into the hands of the person wronged, and he, in return for
all this, had honored you, made you partaker of all that he had, and in
the assembly of his friends, of those in whose presence he was insulted,
had crowned you, and declared that he would hold you as his own begotten
son, and then straightway had died: say, would you not have bewailed
him? would you not have deemed his death a calamity? would you not have
said, Would that he were alive, that I might have it in my power to make
the fit return, that I might requite him, that I might show myself not
base to my benefactor? So then, where it is but man, this is how you
would act; and where it is God, are you eager to be gone, that you may
not requite your benefactor for so great gifts? Nay rather, choose the
time for coming to Him so that you shall have it in your power to
requite Him like for like. True, <span id="fr_570"></span>[571](#fn_570.md)
say you, but I cannot keep (the gift). Has God commanded
impossibilities? Hence it is that all is clean reversed, hence that, all
the world over, every thing is marred—because nobody makes it his mark
to live after God. Thus those who are yet Catechumens, because they make
this their object, (how they may defer baptism to the last,) give
themselves no concern about leading an upright life: and those who have
been baptized (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxiii-p24.8"></span>φωτισθεντες</span>), whether it be because
they received it as children, or whether it be that having received it
in sickness, and afterwards recovered (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxiii-p24.9"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxiii-p24.10"></span>νενεγκόντες</span>), they had no hearty
desire to live on (to the glory of God), so it is, that neither do these
make an earnest business of it: nay, even such as received it in health,
have little enough to show of any good impression, and warmly affected
for the time, these also presently let the fire go out. Why do you flee?
why do you tremble? what is it you are afraid of? You do not mean to say
that you are not permitted to follow your business? I do not part you
from your wife! No, it is from fornication that I bar you. I do not
debar you from the enjoyment of your wealth? No, but from covetousness
and rapacity. I do not oblige you to empty out all your coffers? No, but
to give some small matter according to your means to them that lack,
your superfluities to their need, and not even this unrewarded. We do
not urge you to fast? We do but forbid you to besot yourselves with
drunkenness and gormandizing. The things we would retrench are but the
very things which bring you disgrace; things which even here, on this
side of hell-fire, you yourselves confess to be things to be shunned and
hated. We do not forbid you to be glad and to rejoice? Nay, only rejoice
not with a disgraceful and unbecoming merriment. What is it you dread,
why are you afraid, why do you tremble? Where marriage is, where
enjoyment of wealth, where food in moderation, what matter of sin is
there in these things? And yet, they that are without enjoin the
opposites to these, and are obeyed. For they demand not according to thy
means, but they say, Thou must give thus much: and if thou allege
poverty, they will <span id="fr_571"></span>[572](#fn_571.md) make no
account of that. Not so Christ: Give, saith He, of what thou hast, and I
inscribe thee in the first rank. Again those say, If thou wilt
distinguish thyself, forsake father, mother, kindred, friends, and keep
close attendance on the Palace, laboring, toiling, slaving, distracted,
suffering miseries without number. Not so Christ; but keep thou, saith
He, at home with thy wife, with thy children, and as for thy daily
occupations reform and regulate them on the plan of leading a peaceable
life, free from cares and from perils. True, say you, but the other
promises wealth. Aye, but Christ a kingdom, and more, He promises wealth
also with it. For, “Seek ye,” saith He, “the kingdom of Heaven, and all
these things shall be added unto you” ([Matt. vi.
33](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#033)<span id="vi.xxiii-p25.6"></span>.md):
throwing in, <span id="fr_572"></span>[573](#fn_572.md) by way of
additional boon, what the other holds out as the main thing: and the
Psalmist says, he has “never seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed
begging their bread.” (<span id="vi.xxiii-p26.3"></span>[Ps. xxxvii.
25](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#025)<span id="vi.xxiii-p26.4"></span>..md)
Let us set about practising virtue, let us make a beginning; let us only
lay hold on it, and you shall see what the good will be. For surely in
these (worldly) objects you do not succeed so without labor, that you
should be so faint-hearted for these (higher) objects—that <span
id="fr_573"></span>[574](#fn_573.md) you should say, Those are to be had
without labor, these only with toil. Nay,—what need to tell you what is
the true state of the case?—those are had only with greater labor. Let
us not recoil from the Divine Mysteries, I beseech you. Look not at
this, that one who was baptized before thee, has turned out ill, and has
fallen from his hope: since among soldiers also we see some not doing
their duty by the service, while we see others distinguishing
themselves, and we do not look only at the idle ones, but we emulate
these, the men who are successful. But besides, consider how many, after
their baptism, have of men become angels!

<span id="vi.xxiii-p28"></span>Fear the uncertainty of the future. “As a
thief in the night,” so death comes: and not merely as a thief, but
while we sleep it sets upon us, and carries us off while we are idling.
To this end has God made the future uncertain, that we may spend our
time in the practice of virtue, because of the uncertainty of
expectation. But He is merciful, say you. How long shall we hear this
senseless, ridiculous talk? *I* affirm not only that God is merciful,
but that nothing can be more merciful than He, and that He orders all
things concerning us for our good. How many all their life do you see
afflicted with the worst form of leprosy! (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxiii-p28.1"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxiii-p28.2"></span>ν ἐλέφαντι διάγοντας</span>,
“Elephantiasis,”) how many blind from their earliest youth even to old
age! others who have lost their eyesight, others in poverty, others in
bonds, others again in the mines, others entombed (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxiii-p28.3"></span>καταχωσθέντας</span>)
together, others (slaughtered) in wars! These things say you, do not
look like mercy. Say, could He not have prevented these things had He
wished, yet He permits them? True, say you. Say, those who are blind
from their infancy, why are they so? I will not tell you, until you
promise me to receive baptism, and, being baptized, to live aright. It
is not right to give you the solution of these questions. The preaching
is not meant just for amusement. For even if I solve this, on the back
of this follows another question: of such questions there is a
bottomless deep. Therefore <span id="fr_574"></span>[575](#fn_574.md) do
not get into a habit of looking to have them solved for you: else we
shall never stop questioning. For look, if I solve this, I do but lead
the way to question upon question, numberless as the snowflakes. So that
this is what we learn, rather to raise questions, not to solve the
questions that are raised. For even if we do solve them, we have not
solved them altogether, but (only) as far as man’s reasoning goes. The
proper solution of such questions is faith: the knowing that God does
all things justly and mercifully and for the best: that to comprehend
the reason of them is impossible. This is the one solution, and another
better than this exists not. For say, what is the use of having a
question solved? This, that one needs no longer to make a question of
the thing which is solved. And if thou get thyself to believe this, that
all things are ordered by the Providence of God, Who, for reasons known
to Himself, permits some things and actively works others, thou art rid
of the need of questioning, and hast gotten the gain of the solution.
But let us come back to our subject. Do you not see such numbers of men
suffering chastisements? God (say you) permits these things to be. Make
the right use of the health of the body, in order to the health of the
soul. But you will say, What is the use to me of labors and toil, when
it is in my power to get quit of all (my sins) without labor? In the
first place, this is not certain. It may happen, that a person not only
does not get quit of his sins without labor, but that he departs hence
with all his sins upon him. However, even if this were certain, still
your argument is not to be tolerated. He has drawn thee to the contests:
the golden arms lie there. When you ought to take them, and to handle
them, you wish to be ingloriously saved, and to do no good work! Say, if
war broke out, and the Emperor were here, and you saw some charging into
the midst of the phalanxes of the enemy, hewing them down, dealing
wounds by thousands, others thrusting (with the sword’s point), others
hounding (now here, now there), others dashing on horseback, and these
praised by the Emperor, admired, applauded, crowned: others on the
contrary thinking themselves well off if they take no harm, and keeping
in the hindmost ranks, and sitting idly there; then after the close of
the war, the former sort summoned, honored with the greatest gifts,
their names proclaimed by the heralds: while of the latter, not even the
name becomes known, and their reward of the good obtained is only that
they are safe: which sort would you wish to belong to? Why, if you were
made of stone, if you were more stupid even than senseless and lifeless
things, would you not ten thousand times rather belong to the former?
Yea, I beseech and implore you. For if need were to fall fighting, ought
you not eagerly to choose this? See you not how it is with them that
have fallen in the wars, how illustrious they are, how glorious? And yet
they die a death, after which there is no getting honor from the
emperor. But in that other war, there is nothing of the kind, but thou
shalt in any wise be presented with thy scars. Which scars, even without
persecutions, may it be granted all us to have to exhibit, through Jesus
Christ our Lord, with Whom to the Father and the Holy Ghost together be
glory, dominion, honor, now and ever, and world without end. Amen.

id="vi.xxiii-p5.18"></span>

<span id="vi.xxiii-p6"></span> By saying “it is not lawful,” Peter does
not refer to any specific command in the Mosaic law forbidding
intercourse with Gentiles. The separateness of the Jewish people from
the heathen world had, indeed, its basis in the Levitical system,
especially in the regulations concerning ceremonial cleanness. Still the
Jews had constant commercial relations with other nations. Peter here
refers, no doubt, to the customary and traditional exclusiveness of his
nation which had become a social as well as a religious trait, and which
had been extended far beyond the purport of the Mosaic requirements,
which had for their end the preservation of the truth and purity of the
religion of the nation. This exclusive and jealous spirit is frequently
reflected in the N.T. and contemporaneous literature. The Jewish
Christians accuse Peter ([Acts xi.
3](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#003)<span id="vi.xxiii-p6.1"></span>.md) of
eating with the uncircumcised. On another occasion, the prejudices of
his kinsmen and friends intimidated him and constrained him to break off
his custom of associating with the Gentile Christians at meals (<span
id="vi.xxiii-p6.2"></span>[Gal. ii.
11](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#011.md)<span id="vi.xxiii-p6.3"></span>
sq.). “Moses,” says Josephus, “does not allow those who come to us
without living according to our laws to be admitted into communion with
us” (*Contra Apion.* ii. 29). Tacitus accuses the Jews of harboring “the
bitterest animosity against all other nations” (*Hist.* v. 5) and
Juvenal says that they will not point out the way except to those of
their own religion, and that they will “conduct those only to the
fountain inquired after who are circumcised” (*Sat.* xiv. 103). How
great was the lesson then, which Peter had been taught in the vision! It
is not strange that it was only gradually learned and practised.—G.B.S.

<span id="fn_555"></span>[i:556](1110028.htm#fr_555.md) <span
id="vi.xxiii-p6.6"></span>

<span id="vi.xxiii-p7"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxiii-p7.1"></span>Καὶ ἐν τισὶν ἡμέραις·</span> so all the <span
class="c14"><span id="vi.xxiii-p7.2"></span>mss.</span> with Cat. (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxiii-p7.3"></span>ἔ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxiii-p7.4"></span>ν τισιν ἡμ</span>.) and
Œcum. If the text be not corrupt, Chrys. must be understood to interpret
<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxiii-p7.5"></span>ἀ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxiii-p7.6"></span>πὸ τετάρτης ἡμ</span>. of
the “fourth day of the week:” i.e. Cornelius had anticipated, among
other pious observances, this practice also, viz. of the Wednesday fast.
Otherwise, there is no intelligible connection for the following words,
<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxiii-p7.7"></span>Διὰ γὰρ τοῦτο εἶπεν,
᾽Απὸ τετάρτης ἡμέρας</span>. This, he says, was an advance in piety: and
then it was that the Angel appeared to him. Then he proceeds to argue,
that it is not “four days ago,” for the time does not amount to that
number of days: the day on which Peter arrived was not the fourth, but
between that and the day on which Cornelius prayed, there are but two
entire days. It seems that this must be St. Chrysostom’s meaning, though
it is obscured by mistakes of the scribes. B. C. <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxiii-p7.8"></span>αὕτη μία ἡμέρα· καὶ ἥν
ἦλθον μία· καὶ τῇ τρίτῃ ἐφάνη· ὡς εἶναι δευτέραν μεθ᾽ ἣν
προσηύξατο</span>. (A. omits the passage.) E. D. F. Edd. <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxiii-p7.9"></span>αὕτη μία ἡμέρα· καὶ ἣν
ἀπῆλθον οἱ πεμφθέντες, μία· καὶ ἣν ἦλθον, μία· καὶ τῂ τετάρτῃ ἐφάνη· ὡς
εἶναι δευτέραν μεθ᾽ ἣν προσηύξατο</span>. Cat. and Œc. agree with E. D.
F. in supplying the clause omitted in B. C , to which however they add
<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxiii-p7.10"></span>παρὰ
Κορνηλίου</span>: they have also <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxiii-p7.11"></span>τετάρτῃ ἐφάνη</span>, but for the last clause
they read, <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxiii-p7.12"></span>ὡ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxiii-p7.13"></span>σεὶ τρίτην ὥραν μεθ᾽ ἣν προσηύξατο</span>.
But the sense intended by Chrys. should be: “This, the day (on which
they left Joppa), is one day (before the day on which Cornelius is
speaking): and the day on which the messengers from Cornelius came, one
day; (therefore the second day before that on which Cornelius is
speaking:) and on the third day (previous) the Angel appeared: so that,
exclusively of the day on which Cornelius is speaking, and that on which
Cornelius prayed, there are two days.” This sense will be satisfied by
reading, <span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxiii-p7.14"></span>αὕτη μία
ἡμέρα· καὶ ἣν ἦλθον οἱ πεμφθέντες παρὰ Κορνηλίου, μία· καὶ τῇ τρίτῃ
ἐφάνη· & 244·στε εἶναι δυὸ ἡμέρας μεθ᾽ ἣν προσηύξατο</span>. The
scribes, mistaking both the drift and the method of the calculation,
supposed <span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxiii-p7.15"></span>αὕτη
ἡμ</span>. to mean “the day of Peter’s arrival:” but the day before that
was the day on which they came away (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxiii-p7.16"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxiii-p7.17"></span>πῆλθον</span>) from Joppa, and on the
previous day the messengers arrived (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxiii-p7.18"></span>ἦ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxiii-p7.19"></span>λθον</span>), and on the day before that,
which is therefore the fourth, the Angel appeared: hence they insert the
words <span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxiii-p7.20"></span>καὶ ἣν
ἀπῆ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxiii-p7.21"></span>lqon…</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxiii-p7.22"></span>μία</span>, in order to make out the
calculation, i.e. to verify the day of the Vision as the fourth day
before that on which Cornelius is speaking. So Cat. Œc. and. E.D.F. But
B. C. retain the original reading, and only mistake the abbreviated form
<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxiii-p7.23"></span>ὥ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxiii-p7.24"></span>στε εἶναι β'ἡμ</span>.,
i.e. δυὸ ἡμέρας, as if it meant “the second day,” <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxiii-p7.25"></span>δευτέραν ἡμέραν</span>:
which reading, though unintelligible, was retained by the later Editors.
But what Chrys. means to say, is, that, not reckoning the day of the
vision and the day of the meeting, there are two whole days: therefore
the day of the vision was not “the fourth day hence;” consequently, that
it means “the fourth day of the week.” This hasty and ill considered
interpretation of the expression <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxiii-p7.26"></span>απὸ τετάρτης ἡμέρας</span>, was suggested by
the circumstance that the rule was to fast on the *dies stationum,*
<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxiii-p7.27"></span>τετρὰς</span> and
<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxiii-p7.28"></span>προσάββατον</span>,
to “the ninth hour:” so that the practical scope of the interpretation
may be of this kind: “See how this man, Gentile as he was, had
forestalled our rule of discipline: he fasted on the fourth day of the
week, and to the ninth hour of the day: and see how God was pleased to
approve of his piety, by sending the Angel to him on that day, and at
that hour. But you who know the rule, and why it is prescribed, do not
obey it,” etc.—On the *Dies Stationum,* see Tertull. *de Jejun.* 1.
where in defence of the Montanists, who extended the fast beyond the
ninth hour, (or 3 p.m.) he says: *Arguunt nos quod stationes plerumque
in vesperam producamus: ib.* 10. *Æque stationes nostras ut indignas,
quasdam vero et in serum constitutas, novitatis nomine incusant, hoc
quoque munus et ex arbitrio obeundum esse dicentes, et non ultra nonam
detinendum, suo scilicet more:* i.e. the Catholics maintained, that the
fast on these days ought not to be compulsory, nor to be prolonged
beyond the ninth hour. Epiphan. *Expos. Fid.* §. 22. <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxiii-p7.29"></span>δἰ ὅλου μὲν τοῦ ἔτους ἡ
νηστεία φυλάττεται ἐν τῇ αὐτῇ ἁγί& 139· καθολικῇ ἐκκλησί& 139·, φημὶ δὲ

<span id="vi.xxiii-p8"></span> It is wholly improbable that <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxiii-p8.1"></span>ἀ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxiii-p8.2"></span>πὸ τετράτης ἡμέρας</span>
refers to the fourth day of the week, as Chrys. supposes. The meaning is
that, four days ago (reckoning from the time when he was speaking) he
was praying (“observing the ninth hour of prayer”) until the time of day
at which he was now saying these words to Peter. There is still less
ground for Chrysostom’s interpretation if with Lechler, Tischendorf, and
Westcott and Hort <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxiii-p8.3"></span>νηστεὑων</span> be omitted from the
text.—G.B.S.

<span id="vi.xxiii-p9"></span> The letters *a, b, c, d,* mark the order
of these portions in B. C. At the end of (*a*) the clause, “We are
present,” etc. is repeated. In A the order is, *a, d,* the rest being
omitted: in the modern text, *a, d, c, b:* and the text, “Now therefore
are we all present,” etc. between (*c*) and (*b*).—With the
interpretation of <span class="Greek"><span

the Catena on x. 4, <span class="Greek"><span

class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxiii-p9.3"></span>δεκτὸς αὐτῷ ἐστι·

cited as an instance: persecutor as he was, “yet, because he led a
blameless life, and did not these things of human passion, he was both
accepted and far outwent all. But if some one should say, ‘How is it
that such an one, the Greek, kind as he is and good and humane,
continues in error?’ I answer, that he has a fault of a different kind,
vainglory or sluggishness of mind, or not being in earnest about his
salvation, but thinking that all the circumstances of his life are mere
chance-medley and haphazard. But by ‘him that worketh righteousness,’
Peter means, him that is blameless in all things (comp. *infra* p.
151.)……‘How is it then,’ you will say, ‘that impure persons have been
accounted worthy to have the Gospel preached to them (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxiii-p9.4"></span>κατηξιώθησαν τοῦ
κηρύγματος</span>)?’ Because they were willing and desirous. For some,
even which are in error, He draws, when they become cleansed from their
vices; and others coming of their own accord, He repulses not: many also
have inherited their piety from their ancestors.”

id="vi.xxiii-p11.1"></span>): “Peter is here speaking of the
admissibility of the Gentiles into the Church of Christ; and he here
asserts that there is no natural obstacle in the way of any one who
fears God and works righteousness; that there is now no barrier such as
circumcision, no external hindrance, but that all are equally acceptable
to God. As Meyer well puts it, <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxiii-p11.2"></span>δεκτὸς αὐτῷ ἐστίν</span> indicates the
capability in relation to God to become a Christian, but not the
capability to be saved without Christ; or, as Bengel observes, *non
indifferentissimus religionum, sed indifferenta nationum hic
asseritur.*” (Gloag, *Com. in loco*).—G.B.S.

<span id="fn_560"></span>[i:561](1110028.htm#fr_560.md) <span
id="vi.xxiii-p11.6"></span>

<span id="vi.xxiii-p12"></span> There is no sufficient reason for the
statement of Chrys. that those to whom Peter spoke did not know Jesus.
It is meant that they were acquainted with the chief facts of his life.
Grammatically <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxiii-p12.1"></span>Ιησοῦν</span> ([Acts
10.38](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#038.md)<span

Jesus’ teaching and miracles, during his lifetime on earth. Moreover,
the apostles had taught in the neighboring cities and wrought miracles,

in Cæsarea itself (<span id="vi.xxiii-p12.6"></span>[Acts viii.

id="vi.xxiii-p13.3"></span>διαστροφὰς</span>) <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxiii-p13.4"></span>σώματος</span> (Cat., <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxiii-p13.5"></span>σωμάτων</span>) <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxiii-p13.6"></span>ὑ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxiii-p13.7"></span>π᾽ ἐκείνου
γενομένας</span>. The term <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxiii-p13.8"></span>πήρωσις</span> here includes loss of sight,
speech, hearing, palsied or withered limbs. “He shows that these are
diabolical, and that they are a violent wrenching, or distortion, of the
body from its proper condition, caused by him.” The sense requires
either <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxiii-p13.9"></span>διαστροφὰς</span> or <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxiii-p13.10"></span>γενομένην</span>. The
next sentence, <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxiii-p13.11"></span>ὥ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxiii-p13.12"></span>σπερ καὶ ὁ Χριστὸς ἔλεγεν</span>, omitted by
Edd., though, except E., all the <span class="c14"><span
id="vi.xxiii-p13.13"></span>mss.</span> and Cat. have it, may refer to
such expressions as that in <span id="vi.xxiii-p13.14"></span>[Luke
xiii. 16](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#016.md)<span
id="vi.xxiii-p13.15"></span>. Or, it may be in its proper place after
the following clause, “For God was with Him:” again, a lowly expression:
just as Christ spake: “for My Father is with Me.”

<span id="fn_562"></span>[i:563](1110028.htm#fr_562.md) <span
id="vi.xxiii-p14.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xxiii-p15"></span> The letters denote the order of the
parts in the <span class="c14"><span
id="vi.xxiii-p15.1"></span>mss.</span> and Edd.

<span id="fn_563"></span>[i:564](1110028.htm#fr_563.md) <span
id="vi.xxiii-p15.13"></span>

<span id="vi.xxiii-p16"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxiii-p16.1"></span>καὶ δόγμα τίθησι</span> (E. Edd. <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxiii-p16.2"></span>εἰσάγει</span>) <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxiii-p16.3"></span>καὶ πολίτειαν</span>. i.
e. “it is assumed, or the case is put, that the person has the right
doctrine, of the One True God (that feareth God), and that he is of a
right conversation (that worketh righteousness.)”

<span id="fn_564"></span>[i:565](1110028.htm#fr_564.md) <span
id="vi.xxiii-p16.6"></span>

<span id="vi.xxiii-p17"></span> In the <span class="c14"><span
id="vi.xxiii-p17.1"></span>mss.</span> and Edd. the order is confused.
In the old text: “The word—Lord of all. First he discourses—with ardor.
Yet for all this He did not spare them. Then he proves how He is Lord of
all. Which He sent, preaching good tidings, not bringing judgment.
\[3.\] He is sent from God to the Jews. Then He shows this withal from
the things which He achieved,” etc. So, with verbal alterations, the
modern text, except that it omits the clause, <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxiii-p17.2"></span>οὐ μὴν οὐδὲ οὕτως ἐφείσατο</span>.

<span id="fn_565"></span>[i:566](1110028.htm#fr_565.md) <span
id="vi.xxiii-p17.5"></span>

<span id="vi.xxiii-p18"></span> Here also the order in the <span
class="c14"><span id="vi.xxiii-p18.1"></span>mss.</span> is confused.
“Again proof. How God—with power. Whence does this appear? who went
about—of the devil. Then from the good that He did, and the greatness,”
etc. The modern text has the same order, and the alterations do not
affect the sense.

<span id="fn_566"></span>[i:567](1110028.htm#fr_566.md) <span
id="vi.xxiii-p18.4"></span>

<span id="vi.xxiii-p19"></span> Perhaps it should be <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxiii-p19.1"></span>φαντασθῇ</span>, “that he
(Cornelius) may not imagine,” etc., therefore he mentions first the
Divine Mission, then the Crucifixion.

<span id="fn_567"></span>[i:568](1110028.htm#fr_567.md) <span
id="vi.xxiii-p19.3"></span>

<span id="vi.xxiii-p20"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxiii-p20.1"></span>ταύτης δὲ οὐδὲν οὕτω σημεῖον μεῖζον ἦν, ὡς τὸ
φαγεῖν καὶ πιεῖν</span>. Cat. rightly omits <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxiii-p20.2"></span>μεῖζον ἦν</span>. E. Edd. <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxiii-p20.3"></span>οὕτως εἰς ἀπόδειξιν
μεῖζον, ὡς</span>.

<span id="fn_568"></span>[i:569](1110028.htm#fr_568.md) <span
id="vi.xxiii-p21.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xxiii-p22"></span> The original reporter seems to have
misunderstood what was said. If <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxiii-p22.1"></span>εἰπέ μοι</span> be retained, we must read
<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxiii-p22.2"></span>οὐχὶ αὐτὸς</span>.
The sense is, “Take heed lest any lay the blame of your evil doings upon
God. For you know what would be said of a magistrate who should let a
murderer go unpunished; that he would be held responsible for all the
murders that may be afterwards done by that man, or in consequence of
his impunity. Dread lest through your misconduct God be thus
blasphemed.” But—as if Chrysostom’s meaning had been, Since God’s
purpose in forgiving us our sins was, that we should lead more virtuous
and holy lives, therefore let none presume to say that God, by forgiving
us, is the cause of the evil doings of which we are afterwards
guilty”—the modern text (E. D. F. Edd.) goes on thus: “For say, if a
magistrate, etc. is he judged to be the cause of the murders thereafter
committed? By no means. And how is it that we ourselves, while, by the
things we dare to do, we expose God to be insulted by godless tongues,
do not fear and shudder? For what,” etc.

<span id="fn_569"></span>[i:570](1110028.htm#fr_569.md) <span
id="vi.xxiii-p22.4"></span>

<span id="vi.xxiii-p23"></span> E. D. F. Edd. “Therefore, that it may
not be possible for Him through us to be called, etc., and lest by the
very fact of His being thus blasphemed; we ourselves become liable to
the punishment thereof (‘For through you,’ it is written, ‘My Name is
blasphemed among the Gentiles,’) let us cause the very opposite to be
said, by having our conversation worthy of Him that calleth us, and
(worthily) approaching to the baptism of adoption. For great indeed,”
etc. In C. it is: “teacher of wickedness. Let us cause the very opposite
to be said. For great indeed.” etc. B. “teacher of wickedness. For great
indeed,” etc. But the genuineness of the latter clauses, <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxiii-p23.1"></span>ἀ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxiii-p23.2"></span>ξίως τοῦ καλοῦντος
πολιτευόμενοι καὶ τῷ τῆς υἱοθεσίας προσιόντες βαπτίσματι</span>, which
are also needed by the following context, is attested by A. which
retains them; for this <span class="c14"><span
id="vi.xxiii-p23.3"></span>ms</span>. abridges much, but never borrows
from the modern text.

<span id="fn_570"></span>[i:571](1110028.htm#fr_570.md) <span
id="vi.xxiii-p23.7"></span>

<span id="vi.xxiii-p24"></span> Here all the <span class="c14"><span
id="vi.xxiii-p24.1"></span>mss.</span> have <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxiii-p24.2"></span>Τί φεύγεις</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxiii-p24.3"></span>;</span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxiii-p24.4"></span>τί τρέμεις</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxiii-p24.5"></span>;</span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxiii-p24.6"></span>τί δέδοικας</span>; (Edd. omit the two latter
clauses,) which, being out of place here, and required below, we have
transposed to the beginning of the set of questions <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxiii-p24.7"></span>Μὴ γὰρ οὐκ ἔνι κ. τ.
λ</span>.—Below, he laments that the Catechumens, while delaying their
baptism, if possible, to their dying hour, think themselves no way
concerned to lead a virtuous life: of the baptism he distinguishes three
classes: 1. those who received the sacrament in infancy; 2. those who
were baptized in sickness and fear of death, but afterwards recovered:
both which sorts, he says, are alike careless (the former because
baptized in unconscious infancy), the latter because they did not think
to survive, and had no hearty desire to live to the glory of God; 3.
those baptized in mature age, and in health; and these also, if at the
time their affections were kindled, soon let the flame go out.

<span id="fn_571"></span>[i:572](1110028.htm#fr_571.md) <span
id="vi.xxiii-p24.11"></span>

<span id="vi.xxiii-p25"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxiii-p25.1"></span>οὐδὲν προσποιήσονται</span>, meaning perhaps,
“they will pretend to make no account of that: they will say that that
makes no difference.” Edd. from E. only, <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxiii-p25.2"></span>οὐδὲ οὕτως ἀφίστανται</span>, “they do not
desist for all that.”—Below: <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxiii-p25.3"></span>καὶ αὐτὰ ταῦτα διάπλαττεκαὶ ῥ&
192·θμιζε</span>: i.e. Christ does not require you to abandon your
calling in life, but these same occupations and duties of your station
He bids you to mould and bring into entire conformity with His
commandments:—<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxiii-p25.4"></span>τὸν
ἀπράγμονα βίον ζῇν καὶ ἀκίνδυνον</span>: something is wanting, the sense
being, “making it your object (not to obtain distinction, wealth, etc.
but) to lead a quiet life in godliness and honesty.” Savile reads <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxiii-p25.5"></span>ζῆθι</span>.

<span id="fn_572"></span>[i:573](1110028.htm#fr_572.md) <span
id="vi.xxiii-p25.7"></span>

<span id="vi.xxiii-p26"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxiii-p26.1"></span>Καὶ ἐπὶ προσθήκης μέσει, ἃ προηγουμένως
ἐκεῖνος· καὶ οὐκ εἶδεν, φησί, δίκαιον κ. τ. λ</span>. The modern text
(E. D. F. Edd.) inverts the meaning: <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxiii-p26.2"></span>Καὶ ἐκεῖνος μὲν οὐδὲ ἐν προσθήκης μέρει,
οὗτος δὲ καὶ προηγουμένως</span>. “And the former does not even by way
of additional boon (hold out this), the latter (Christ) as the main
thing.” Adding, “I have been young, saith (the Psalmist), for indeed I
am become old: and I never saw,” etc.

<span id="fn_573"></span>[i:574](1110028.htm#fr_573.md) <span
id="vi.xxiii-p26.5"></span>

<span id="vi.xxiii-p27"></span> E. D. F. Edd. “‘Yes,’ say you, ‘those
(are to be had) without labor, these with labor.’ Away with (such talk):
it is not, no it is not so, but if one must say the truth, those
(objects) are more yoked with toils, and are achieved with greater toil:
but these, if we choose, easily.”

<span id="fn_574"></span>[i:575](1110028.htm#fr_574.md) <span
id="vi.xxiii-p28.4"></span>

<span id="vi.xxiii-p29"></span> <span class="Greek"><span

id="vi.xxiii-p29.2"></span>Ωστε μὴ πρὸς τοῦτο ἐθίζετε ἑαυτοὺς, πρὸς τὸ
λύσιν ζητεῖν</span>. A. B. C. Sav. But the modern text has <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxiii-p29.3"></span>μόνον</span> for <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxiii-p29.4"></span>πρὸς τοῦτο</span>, and

solution (of the questions), but also not to raise the
questions.”—Below: <span class="Greek"><span
