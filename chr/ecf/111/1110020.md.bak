<span id="vi.xv-p1"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vi.xv-p1.1"></span>Homily XV.</span>

<span id="vi.xv-p2"></span>[Acts VI.
8](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#008.md)<span id="vi.xv-p2.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xv-p3"></span>“And Stephen, full of faith and power, did
great wonders and miracles among the people.”

<span id="vi.xv-p4"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="vi.xv-p4.1"></span>See</span> how even among the seven one was
preëminent, and won the first prize. For though the ordination was
common to him and them, yet he drew upon himself greater grace. And
observe, how he wrought no (signs and wonders) before this time, but
only when he became publicly known; to show that grace alone is not
sufficient, but there must be ordination also; so that there was a
further access of the Spirit. For if they were full of the Spirit, it
was of that which is from the Laver of Baptism. “Then there arose
certain of them of the synagogue.” ([Acts
6.9](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#009)<span id="vi.xv-p4.2"></span>..md)
Again he uses the phrase of “rising up” (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xv-p4.3"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xv-p4.4"></span>νάστασιν</span>, Hom. xiii. p. 81), to denote
their exasperation and wrath. Here we have a great multitude. And
observe the difference in the form of accusation: for since Gamaliel had
stopped them from finding fault on the former plea, they bring in
another charge. “And there rose up, it says, certain of them of the
synagogue of those who are called (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xv-p4.5"></span>τὥν λεγομένων</span>. Edd. <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xv-p4.6"></span>τἥς λεγομένης</span>)
Libertines, and of the Cyrenians and Alexandrians, and of them of
Cilicia and Asia, disputing with Stephen. And they were not able to
resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake. Then they suborned
men, which said, We have heard him speak blasphemous words against
Moses, and against God.” ([Acts
6.9-12](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#009)<span id="vi.xv-p4.7"></span>..md)
That they may establish the charge, the phrase is, “he speaks against
God, and against Moses.” And with this object too they disputed, that
they might force him to say somewhat. But he now discoursed more openly,
and perhaps spoke of the cessation of the Divine Law: or, spoke it not,
but hinted as much: since had he spoken plainly, there had been no need
of suborned men, nor yet of false witnesses. <span
id="fr_342"></span>[343](#fn_342.md) The synagogues were diverse: \[to wit,
“Of the Libertines”\]: “of the Cyrenians, i.e. those in the parts beyond
Alexandria \[“of the Alexandrians,” etc.\]. There also they seem to have
had synagogues according to their different nations; for many stayed
behind there, that they might not be obliged to be continually
travelling. The Libertines perhaps were freedmen of the Romans. As there
were many foreigners dwelling there, so they had their synagogues, where
the Law was to be read. “Disputing with Stephen.” Observe him, not
taking upon him to teach, but forced to do so. The miracles once more
brought him into ill-will; but when he overcame in argument, it was
false-witness! For they did not wish to kill intolerable to them. “They
could not resist, etc.: then they suborned men.” Everywhere out of hand,
but by means of a sentence, that they might hurt their reputation also:
and leaving those (the Apostles), they attack these (the disciples),
thinking in this way to terrify those also. They say not, “he speaketh,”
but, “he ceaseth not to speak. And they stirred up the people, and the
elders, and the scribes, and came upon him, and caught him, and brought
him to the council, and set up false witnesses, which said, This man
ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the
law.” ([Acts 6:12](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#012.md),
[13](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#013)<span id="vi.xv-p5.3"></span>..md)
“Ceaseth not,” say they, as if he made this his business. “For we have
heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and
shall change the customs which Moses delivered us.” ([Acts
6.14](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#014)<span id="vi.xv-p5.4"></span>..md)
“Jesus,” they say, “the Nazarene,” as a term of reproach, “shall destroy
this place, and shall change the customs.” This is also what they said
about Christ. “Thou that destroyest this Temple.” ([Matt. xxvii.
40](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#040)<span id="vi.xv-p5.5"></span>..md) For
great was their veneration for the Temple (as indeed they had chosen to
leave their own country (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xv-p5.6"></span>μετοικεἴν</span>) in order to be near it) and for
the name of Moses. The charge is twofold. If <span
id="fr_343"></span>[344](#fn_343.md) He “shall change the customs,” He will
also introduce others instead: observe how the charge is a bitter one,
and fraught with perils. “And all that sat in the council, looking
steadfastly on him, saw his face as it had been the face of an angel.”
([Acts 6.15](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#015.md)<span
id="vi.xv-p6.1"></span>.) So possible is it even for one in a lower
degree to shine. For what, I ask, had this man less than the Apostles?
He lacked not miracles, and great was the boldness he exhibited. <span
id="fr_344"></span>[345](#fn_344.md) —“They saw His face,” it is said, “as
it had been the face of an angel.” (<span id="vi.xv-p7.10"></span>[Ex.
xxxiv. 30](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#030.md)<span
id="vi.xv-p7.11"></span>.) For this was his grace, this was the glory of
Moses. God made him thus gracious (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xv-p7.12"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xv-p7.13"></span>πίχαριν</span>) of visage, now that he was about
to say somewhat, thus at once by his very look to awe them. For there
are, yes, there are faces full-fraught with spiritual grace, lovely to
them that love, awful to haters and enemies. It mentions also the
reason, why they suffered his oration.—“Then,” it proceeds, “said the
high-priest, Are these things so?” ([Acts
7.1](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#001)<span id="vi.xv-p7.14"></span>..md)
Observe, the question is put with mildness, that he may effect some
great mischief. For this reason Stephen too begins his speech in a tone
of gentleness, and says, “Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken; The God
of glory appeared unto our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia,
before he dwelt in Charran.” ([Acts
7.2](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#002)<span id="vi.xv-p7.15"></span>..md)
Immediately at the outset he overthrows their conceit, and makes it
appear by what he says, that the temple is nothing, that the customs are
nothing either, without their suspecting his drift: also that they shall
not overcome the preaching; and that from powerless (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xv-p7.16"></span>ἀ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xv-p7.17"></span>μηχάνων</span>) things God
evermore contrives Him powerful (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xv-p7.18"></span>εὐμήχανα</span>) instruments. Mark then how
these threads make the texture of the whole speech: and moreover that
having evermore enjoyed exceeding goodness, they still requited their
Benefactor with the opposite conduct, and that they are now attempting
impossibilities. “The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham,
when he was in Mesopotamia, before he came into Charran.” Both the
temple was not, and sacrifice was not, and yet a vision of God was
vouchsafed to Abraham, and yet had he Persians <span
id="fr_345"></span>[346](#fn_345.md) for his ancestors, and was in a
strange land. And he does well at the beginning of his speech to call
Him, “the God of glory:” seeing that He hath made them that are without
honor to be glorious. “Because” (says he) “it was He that made them
glorious, He will make us also.” Observe how he leads them away from
things of the body, from the place, in the first instance, as the place
was in question. “The God of glory,” says he: implying again, that He
needs not the glory which comes from us, which comes by the Temple: for
Himself is the Fountain thereof. Think not, he would say, in this way to
glorify Him. “And from thy kindred.” How <span
id="fr_346"></span>[347](#fn_346.md) then saith the Scripture, that
Abraham’s father was willing to go out? Hence we learn, that it was in
consequence of Abraham’s vision, that his father was moved to join in
the migration. ([Gen. xi. 31](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#031.md)<span
id="vi.xv-p9.1"></span>.) “And said unto him, Get thee out of thy
country, and from thy kindred, and come into a land which I shall show
thee.” ([Acts 7.3](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#003.md)<span
id="vi.xv-p9.2"></span>.) It shows how far these men are from being
children of Abraham, how obedient he was. “And <span
id="fr_347"></span>[348](#fn_347.md) from thy kindred.” Uncomfortable
(<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xv-p10.1"></span>φορτικὰ</span>)
reflections, both, that he endured the labors, while ye reap the fruits,
and that all your ancestors were in evil case. “Then came he out of the
land of the Chaldæans, and dwelt in Charran: and from thence, when his
father was dead, He removed him into this land, wherein ye now dwell.
And He gave him none inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his
foot on.” ([Acts 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#004.md),
[5](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#005)<span id="vi.xv-p10.2"></span>..md) See
how he raises their thoughts away from (their possession of) the
land. <span id="fr_348"></span>[349](#fn_348.md) For if He said (that, He
will give: clearly \[all came from him\], and nothing from themselves.
For he came, having left both kindred and country. Wherefore then did He
not give it to him? Truly it was a figure of another land. “And He
promised to give it to him.” Do you perceive, that he does not merely
resume the thread of his discourse? “He gave him not,” says he; “and He
promised; and to his seed after him, when as yet he had no child.”
Again, what God can do: that out of impossibilities, He doeth all. For
here is a man in Persia, so far away, and this man God saith He will
make lord of Palestine. But let us look back to what was said before.

<span id="vi.xv-p12"></span>Whence, I pray you, did that grace bloom
upon the countenance of Stephen? (Recapitulation.) The writer gives him
this report above, that he was “full of faith.” ([Acts
6.8](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#008)<span id="vi.xv-p12.1"></span>.md).
For it is possible to have a grace that does not consist in works of
healing: “For to one is given the grace of the Spirit (<span
id="vi.xv-p12.2"></span>[1 Cor. 12:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#008.md),
[9](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#009)<span id="vi.xv-p12.3"></span>.md) in
such and such wise (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xv-p12.4"></span>τοιὣσδε</span>). But here, it seems to me, it
says that he was also gracious to look at: “They saw his face as it had
been the face of an angel.” “Full of faith and of power”: ([Acts
6.15](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#015)<span id="vi.xv-p12.5"></span>.md)
which is also the character given of Barnabas “he was a good man, full
of faith and of the Holy Ghost.” ([Acts
11.24](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#024)<span id="vi.xv-p12.6"></span>..md)
Whence we learn that the sincere and innocent are, above all others,
the <span id="fr_349"></span>[350](#fn_349.md) men to be saved, and that
these same are also more gracious. “Then they suborned men, which said,
We have heard him speak blasphemous words.” ([Acts
6.11](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#011)<span id="vi.xv-p13.8"></span>..md)
In the case of the Apostles they were annoyed that they preached the
Resurrection, and that much people flowed unto them: but in this case,
that they were getting their diseases healed. ([Acts
4.2](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#002)<span id="vi.xv-p13.9"></span>..md)
The things for which they ought to give thanks, they made matter of
blame: O the madness! The men who overcame them by works, they expected
to overcome by words! It is just what they did in the case of Christ,
and always they forced them to words. For they were ashamed to seize
them without more ado, having nothing to charge them with. And observe,
not the persons themselves who bring them to judgment bear witness
against them; for they would have been refuted: but they simply hire
others, that it may not seem to be an act of mere violence. It is all of
a piece with their proceeding in the case of Christ. And observe the
power of the preaching, that, though they are not only scourged but
stoned, it still prevails: not <span id="fr_350"></span>[351](#fn_350.md)
only, private individuals as they are, dragged to the bar, but assailed
from all quarters: and, their enemies themselves being witnesses, not
only were these worsted, but “they were not able” even “to resist”
([Acts 6.10](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#010.md)<span
id="vi.xv-p14.14"></span>), though they were exceeding shameless: so
mightily did it overthrow them, for all that they could do with their
preposterous figments (as the saying that He had a devil—He that cast
out devils!). For the battle was not man’s, but God’s against men. And
there were many combined together; not only they in Jerusalem, but
others as well. ([Acts 6.9](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#009.md)<span
id="vi.xv-p14.15"></span>.) For “we have heard him,” say they, “speaking
blasphemous words against Moses and against God.” ([Acts
6.11](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#011)<span id="vi.xv-p14.16"></span>..md)
O ye shameless ones! Ye work blasphemous deeds, and think nothing of it.
This is why Moses is added—because the things of God were no great
concern to them: and it is ever and always Moses that they make mention
of: “This Moses, which brought us out.” ([Acts
7.30](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#030)<span id="vi.xv-p14.17"></span>..md)
“And they stirred up the people.” ([Acts
6.12](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#012)<span id="vi.xv-p14.18"></span>..md)
Fickleness <span id="fr_351"></span>[352](#fn_351.md) of the multitude! And
yet how could a man who was a blasphemer have so succeeded? How could a
blasphemer work such miracles among the people? But the undisciplined
multitude made them strong who had the worst of it (in argument).—This
was what most annoyed them. “We have heard him,” they say, “speaking
blasphemous words against Moses and against God” ([Acts
6.13](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#013)<span id="vi.xv-p15.9"></span>.md):
and again, “This man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this
holy place and the law,” and with an addition, “the customs” “which
Moses delivered to us” ([Acts
6.14](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#014)<span id="vi.xv-p15.10"></span>.md);
Moses, not God. Upon the supposition of a design to overturn their
manner of life (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xv-p15.11"></span>πολιτείας</span>), they accused him of impiety
also. But to show that it was not in the nature of such a man to speak
such things, and harshly \[“Then all,” it says, “which were in the
council, looking steadfastly upon him, saw his face, as it had been the
face of an angel”\] ([Acts 6.15](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#015.md)<span
id="vi.xv-p15.12"></span>): so mild was he even in countenance. For, in
cases where persons were not falsely accused, Scripture mentions nothing
of this kind: but as in this case it was all false accusation, with
reason does God rectify it by the very look of the man. For the Apostles
indeed were not falsely accused, but were forbidden: but this man is
falsely accused: and therefore before all else his countenance pleads
for him. This abashed even the priest. “And he said,” etc. ([Acts
7.1](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#001)<span id="vi.xv-p15.13"></span>..md)
He shows here, that the promise was made before the Place, before
Circumcision, before Sacrifice, before the Temple, and that it was not
of their merit that these received either Circumcision or Law, but that
the land was the reward of obedience alone. Moreover, that neither on
the giving of circumcision does the promise receive its fulfillment.
Also, that these were figures, and (so was) both the leaving his country
at God’s command—not <span id="fr_352"></span>[353](#fn_352.md) against the
law (for home and country is where God shall lead): “Then came he out,”
it says, “of the land of the Chaldeans” ([Acts
7.4](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#004.md)<span
id="vi.xv-p16.6"></span>):—and that if one look closely into the matter,
the Jews are of Persian origin: and that, without miracles, one must do
as God bids, whatever hardships be the consequence; since the Patriarch
left both the grave of his father and all that he had, in obedience to
God’s command. But if Abraham’s father was not allowed to take part with
him in the privilege of migrating to Palestine, because he was unworthy:
much more shall the children (be excluded at last), for all that they
may have gone a good distance on the way. “And He promised,” it says,
“to give it to him, and to his seed after him.” ([Acts
7.5](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#005)<span id="vi.xv-p16.7"></span>..md)
Herein is shown the greatness both of God’s goodness and of Abraham’s
faith. For the expression, “when as yet he had no child,” does show his
obedience and faith. “Promised to give it to him and to his seed.” And
yet the events showed the contrary: namely, after he came, he had not
“so much as to set his foot on,” had not a child; which very things were
contrary to his faith.

<span id="vi.xv-p17"></span>These things having seen, let us likewise,
whatever God shall promise, receive the same, however contrary may be
the events. And yet in our case, they are not contrary, but very
suitable. For where the promises are, there, when the contraries turn
out, they are really contrary; but in our case it is just the reverse:
for He has told us that we should have tribulation here, but our rest
there. Why do we confound the times? Why do we turn things upside down?
Say, art thou afflicted, and livest in poverty, and in dejection? Be not
troubled: for it were worth being troubled at, wert thou destined to be
afflicted in that world: as for this present affliction, it is the cause
of rest. “This sickness,” saith He, “is not unto death.” ([John xi.
4](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#004)<span id="vi.xv-p17.1"></span>..md) That
affliction is punishment: this, schooling and correction. It is a
contest, this life present: if so, to fight is our business now: it is
war and battle. In war one does not seek to have rest, in war one does
not seek to have dainty living, one is not anxious about riches, one’s
care is not about a wife then: one thing only he looks at, how he may
overcome his foes. Be this our care likewise: if we overcome, and return
with the victory, God will give us all things. Be this alone our study,
how we may overcome the devil: though after all it is not our own study
that does it, but God’s grace does the whole business. Be it our one
study, how we may attract His grace, how we may draw to ourselves that
assistance. “If God be for us, who can be against us?” (<span
id="vi.xv-p17.2"></span>[Rom. viii.
31](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#031)<span id="vi.xv-p17.3"></span>..md) Let
us make one thing our study; that He be not our enemy, that He turn not
away from us.

<span id="vi.xv-p18"></span>Not the being afflicted is an evil; the evil
is, to sin. This is the sore affliction, however we may pass our days in
luxury:—not to speak of the life to come, it is so even in this life
present. Think how our conscience is stung with remorse, and whether
this is not worse than any kind of torture! I should like to put the
question searchingly to those who live in evil ways (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xv-p18.1"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xv-p18.2"></span>ν κακοἵς</span>), whether
they never come to reflect upon their own sins, whether they do not
tremble, and are in fear and anguish, whether they do not think those
blessed who live in abstinence, them of the mountains, them of the
strict rule? (<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xv-p18.3"></span>τοὺς ἐν
πολλῇ φιλοσοφί& 139·</span>.) Dost thou wish to find rest in the life to
come? Suffer affliction in this life for Christ’s sake: there is nothing
equal to this rest. The Apostles rejoiced when scourged. Paul gives this
exhortation, saying, “Rejoice in the Lord.” (<span
id="vi.xv-p18.4"></span>[Philip. iv.
4](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#004)<span id="vi.xv-p18.5"></span>..md) And
how can there be rejoicing, where there are bonds, where there are
tortures; where there are courts of justice? There, most of all, is
rejoicing. But <span id="fr_353"></span>[354](#fn_353.md) say, how can
there be rejoicing, where these are not? For he who is conscious of no
evil, will have a sort of exceeding delight, insomuch that in what
degree you speak of tribulation, in the same you tell of his delight.
The soldier who has received numberless wounds and is come home again,
will he not return with exceeding delight, with his wounds <span
id="fr_354"></span>[355](#fn_354.md) as his title for speaking up boldly,
and as evidence of his glory and renown? And thou, if thou be able to
exclaim as Paul does, “I bear the marks of Jesus” ([Gal. vi.
17](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#017)<span id="vi.xv-p20.2"></span>.md),
wilt be able to become great and glorious and renowned. “But there is no
persecution.” Make thy stand against glory: and should any one speak
anything against thee, fear not to be evil-spoken of for Christ’s sake:
make thy stand against the tyranny of pride, against the fighting of
anger, against the torment of concupiscence. These also are
“marks,” <span id="fr_355"></span>[356](#fn_355.md) these also are
torments. For, I ask, what is the worst in tortures? Is it not, that the
soul is pained, and is on fire? For in the other case, the body too has
its share: but in this, the whole belongs to the soul. On the soul alone
comes all the smart, when one is angry, when one is envious, whatever
else of this kind one does, or rather suffers. For, in fact, it is not
action, but passion, not a doing, but a suffering—to be angered, to feel
envy: therefore indeed they are called passions (or sufferings) (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xv-p21.2"></span>πάθη</span>,
*perturbationes*) of the soul, yea wounds, and bruises. For it is indeed
a suffering, and worse than suffering. Bethink you, ye that are angry,
that ye do such things in “passion,” in a state of suffering. Therefore
he who is not angry suffers not. Do you mark that not he who is abused
is the sufferer, but he that abuses, as I said above? For that he is a
sufferer, is plain in the first place from the very fact, that such a
thing is called by this name of passion: and it is also plain from the
(effects on the) body: for these are the affections (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xv-p21.3"></span>πάθη</span>) for
“sufferings,” as we call them\] engendered by anger, viz. dimness of
vision, insanity, and numberless others. “But he insulted my boy,” say
you; “but \[he called him\] clown.” <span
id="fr_356"></span>[357](#fn_356.md) Deem it not weakness thy not doing the
same thing thyself. For, I ask you, was it well done? You will not say
that: then leave that undone which being done were not well done. I know
what passions are engendered in such cases. “But,” say you, “how if he
despise me, how if he say it again?” Show him that he is in the wrong:
rebuke him, entreat him: by meekness anger is put down: go and
expostulate with him. For though in cases of wrong done to ourselves it
is right not to do even this, yet it is quite necessary to do it in
behalf of others. Do not look on it as an insult to yourself that your
boy has been insulted: annoyed you may be for his sake, yet not as if
you were insulted: for it does not follow because your boy has been
ill-treated, that you are disgraced, but he is disgraced that did the
ill. Quench (thine anger) that sharp sword: let it lie in its scabbard.
If we have it unsheathed, we shall be apt to use it even when the time
is not proper, being drawn on by it: but if it be hidden, though a
necessity should arise, yet, while we seek it in order <span
id="fr_357"></span>[358](#fn_357.md) to draw it, the anger will be
quenched. Christ would not have us be angry on his account: (hear what
He saith to Peter: “Put up again thy sword into the sheath:”) ([Matt.
xxvi. 52](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#052.md)<span
id="vi.xv-p23.9"></span>) and art thou angry on account of a boy? Teach
thy boy also to be philosophical: tell him thy own sufferings: imitate
(herein) thy Teacher. ([Matt. xxvi.
52](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#052)<span id="vi.xv-p23.10"></span>..md)
When they too (His disciples) were about to be treated with dishonor, He
said not, “I will avenge you:” but, “to Me also,” saith He, “they have
done the same: bear it nobly, for ye are not better than I.” These words
too do thou speak to thy son and thy boy: “Thou art not better than thy
master.” But these words of philosophy are counted as the talk of a
widow woman. Alas! that it is not in the power of words to bring it home
to people in the way that it is possible to be taught it by actual
experience! And that you may learn this; stand between two combatants,
take part with the wronged, not with the wrong-doers \[that you may
learn\] <span id="fr_358"></span>[359](#fn_358.md) whether you shall not
see the victory on your side, whether you shall not get splendid
crowns.—See, how God is insulted, and how He answers; how gently,
“Where,” saith He, “is Abel thy brother?” and what saith the other: “Am
I my brother’s keeper?” ([Gen. vi.
9](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#009)<span id="vi.xv-p24.5"></span>..md) What
could be more contumacious than this? Would any one have heard it
(patiently) even from a son? and if from a brother, would he not have
thought such conduct an insult? What then? See how again God gently
answers, “The voice of thy brother’s blood,” saith He “crieth unto Me.”
“But God,” it will be said, “is superior to wrath.” Yes, but for this
reason the Son of God came down, that He might make thee a God as far as
human power can go. “But I cannot,” says one, “seeing I am man.” Well
then, let us give you men for instances. And do not suppose I speak of
Paul or of Peter: no, but of some of inferior sort, yea, very much lower
down. Eli’s menial insulted Hannah, saying, “Put away thy wine from
thee.” ([1 Sam. i. 14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#014.md)<span
id="vi.xv-p24.6"></span>.) What could be more insulting than this? What
then said she? “I am a woman of a hard lot.” <span
id="fr_359"></span>[360](#fn_359.md) Indeed, there is nothing equal to
affliction: she is the mother of true philosophy. But this same woman,
though she has her rival, insulted her not: but what does she? She takes
refuge with God, and in her prayer does not even make mention of her,
nor say, “Avenge me, for such an one reproaches me:” so magnanimous was
that woman (let us men be ashamed):—and yet ye know, that there is
nothing like jealousy. The publican, when insulted by the Pharisee,
insulted not in return, though, had he wished it, he might have done so:
but he bore it like a philosopher, saying, “Be merciful to me a sinner.”
(<span id="vi.xv-p25.5"></span>[Luke xviii.
13](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#013)<span id="vi.xv-p25.6"></span>..md)
Mephibosheth, <span id="fr_360"></span>[361](#fn_360.md) having been
accused and calumniated by his servant, neither said, nor did, any evil
to him, not even in the presence of the king himself. (<span
id="vi.xv-p26.6"></span>[2 Sam. xix.
26](../../../bib/kjv/sa2019.htm#026)<span id="vi.xv-p26.7"></span>..md)
Shall I tell you even of a harlot, what philosophic magnanimity she
showed? Hear Christ saying, as she was wiping His feet with her hair,
“The publicans and harlots go into the kingdom before you.” ([Matt. xxi.
31](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#031)<span id="vi.xv-p26.8"></span>..md) Do
you see her standing, and taking courage, and washing away her own sins?
Observe, how she was not angry even with the Pharisee, when reproached
by him: “for had He known,” says he, “that this woman is a sinner, He
would not have suffered her (<span id="vi.xv-p26.9"></span>[Luke vii.
39](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#039)<span id="vi.xv-p26.10"></span>.md):
and how she said not to him, “What then? Say, art thou pure from sins?”
but felt more, wept more, and let fall hotter tears. But if women and
publicans and harlots play the philosopher, and that before grace (i.e.
of Baptism), what pardon can they deserve, who, after so great grace,
fight, and worry, and kick one another, worse than beasts? Nothing is
more base than passion, nothing more disgraceful, nothing more
frightful, nothing more odious, nothing more hurtful. These things I
say, not only in order that towards men we may be gentle, but also if a
wife be a talker, that thou mayest bear it: let thy wife be to thee a
school for training and exercise (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xv-p26.11"></span>παλαίστρα καὶ γυμνάσιον</span>). For how can it
but be absurd, to submit to exercises which yield no profit, where we
afflict the body, but not to practise exercises at home, which, even
before the contest, present to us a crown? Does thy wife abuse thee? Do
not thou become a woman: to be abusive is womanly: it is a disease of
the soul, an inferiority. Think not that it is unworthy of thee, when
thy wife abuses thee. Unworthy it is, when thou art abusive, but she
bears patiently (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xv-p26.12"></span>φιλοσοφῇ</span>): then dost thou act unseemly,
then art thou disgraced: but if, having been abused, thou bear it, great
is the proof of thy strength. I do not say this, to induce wives to be
abusive: God forbid: but only in case it should so happen at the
instance of Satan. It is the part of men that are strong, to bear the
weak. And if thy servant contradict thee, bear it philosophically: not
what he deserves to have said to him, do thou say or do, but that which
it behooves thee both to do and to say. Never insult a girl by uttering
some foul word against her: never call thy servant, scoundrel (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xv-p26.13"></span>μιαρὸν</span>): not he is
disgraced, but thou. It is not possible to be master of one’s self,
being in a passion. Like a sea rolling mountains high, it is all
hurly-burly: or even as a pure fountain, when mire is cast into it,
becomes muddied, and all is in turmoil. You may beat him, you may rend
his coat to rags, but it is you that sustain the greater damage: for to
him the blow is on the body and the garment, but to you on the soul. It
is your own soul that you have cut open; it is there that you have
inflicted a wound: you have flung your own charioteer from his horses,
you have got him dragging along the ground upon his back. And it is all
one, as if one driver being in a passion with another, should choose to
be thus dragged along. You may rebuke, you may chide, you may do
whatever if be, only let it be without wrath and passion. For if he who
rebukes is physician to him who offends, how can he heal another, when
he has first hurt himself, when he does not heal himself? Say, if a
physician should go to heal another person, does he first wound his own
hand, first blind his own eyes, and so set about healing that other? God
forbid. So also, however thou rebuke, however thou chide, let thine eyes
see clearly. Do not make thy mind muddy, else how shall the cure be
wrought? It is not possible to be in the same tranquillity, being in a
passion, and being free from passion. Why dost thou first overturn thy
master from his seat, and then discourse with him as he lies sprawling
on the ground? Seest thou not the judges, how, when about to hold the
assize, they seat themselves upon the bench, in their becoming attire?
Thus do thou likewise dress thy soul with the judicial robe (which is
gentleness). “But he will not be afraid of me,” say you. He will be the
more afraid. In the other case, though you speak justly, your servant
will impute it to passion: but if you do it with gentleness, he will
condemn himself: and, what is of the first importance, God will accept
thee, and thus thou wilt be able to attain unto the eternal blessings,
through the grace and loving-kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, with
Whom to the Father together with the Holy Spirit be glory, dominion, and
honor, now and ever, and world without end. Amen.

<span id="vi.xv-p5"></span> The accusations against Stephen were
probably true in part and false in part. He had doubtless spoken against
Jewish legalism and narrowness and had perhaps shown the bearing of O.T.
prophecy and of Jesus’ doctrine of fulfilment upon the fate of the
Jewish system. The charge that he had spoken “against Moses” had, then,
a certain verbal truth which made its moral falseness all the more
subtle. The perversion of his words was due in part to their utter
incapacity to apprehend Christianity as the fulfilment of their own
religion which necessarily involved the passing away of the latter, and
partly from their bitter jealousy and hatred of the Christian “sect” and
the determination to find some excuse to bring against it all the legal
and social forces of the whole Jewish people. In his preaching Stephen
had doubtless sought to set forth the distinctive character of
Christianity as a religion historically founded in Judaism, but not to
be limited and bound by its forms. He but developed germs of truth found
in the teaching of Jesus concerning the Sabbath, ceremonial
purifications, etc. He was the forerunner of Paul, who brought upon
himself the same accusations (<span id="vi.xv-p5.1"></span>[Acts xviii.

<span id="vi.xv-p9"></span> Edd. from E. “And how, it may be asked, doth
the Scripture say this concerning Abraham’s father? Because it does not
trouble itself about matters that are not very essential. What was
useful for us to learn, this only it has taught us, that in consequence
of his son’s vision, he went out with him: the rest it leaves untold, by
reason that he died soon after settling in Charran. ‘Get thee out of thy

class="Greek"><span id="vi.xv-p11.6"></span>δηλῶν ὅτι πάντα</span>. The
meaning seems to be: “They boasted of their possession of the land, as
the token of God’s favor to themselves. See how Stephen will not allow
them to rest in this conceit. Abraham was ‘the friend of God,’ yet to
him ‘He gave none inheritance,’ etc. True ‘He promised to give it’: but
if God said (that) He will give it (spoke of giving it at some future
time); this very circumstance shows that the Jews had it from Abraham,
in consequence of God’s favor to him; not as deserved by themselves.”
