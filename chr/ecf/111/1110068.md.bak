<span id="vii.vii-p1"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vii.vii-p1.1"></span>Homily V.</span>

<span id="vii.vii-p2"></span>[Rom. I.
28](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#028.md)<span id="vii.vii-p2.1"></span>

<span id="vii.vii-p3"></span>“Even as they did not like to retain God in
their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those
things which are not convenient.”

<span id="vii.vii-p4"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="vii.vii-p4.1"></span>Lest</span> he should seem to be hinting at
them by delaying in his discourse so long over the unnatural sin, he
next passes on to other kinds of sins also, and for this cause he
carries on the whole of his discourse as of other persons. And as he
always does when discoursing with believers about sins, and wishing to
show that they are to be avoided, he brings the Gentiles in, and says,
“Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the other Gentiles which know
not God.” (<span id="vii.vii-p4.2"></span>[1 Thess. iv.
5](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#005)<span id="vii.vii-p4.3"></span>..md) And
again: “sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.” ([1 Thess.
4.13](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#013)<span id="vii.vii-p4.4"></span>..md)
And so here too he shows that it was to them the sins belonged, and
deprives them of all excuse. For he says, that their daring deeds came
not of ignorance, but of practice. And this is why he did not say, “and
as they knew not God;” but “as they did not like to retain God in their
knowledge;” as much as to say, that the sin was one of a perverted
determination of obstinacy, more than of a sudden ravishment, and shows
that it was not the flesh (as some heretics say) but the mind, <span
id="fr_1229"></span>[1230](#fn_1229.md) to the wicked lust whereof the sins
belonged, and that it was thence the fount of the evils flowed. <span
id="fr_1230"></span>[1231](#fn_1230.md) For since the mind is become
undistinguishing, <span id="fr_1231"></span>[1232](#fn_1231.md) all else is
then dragged out of course and overturned, when he is corrupted that
held the reins! (Plat. *Phaedr.* 246 A. B.)

<span id="vii.vii-p8"></span>[Rom.
1.29](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#029.md)<span id="vii.vii-p8.1"></span>.
“Being filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, covetousness,
maliciousness.”

<span id="vii.vii-p9"></span>See how everything here is intensitive. For
he says, “being filled,” and “with all,” and having named maliciousness
in general, he also further pursues the particulars, and these too in
excess, saying, “Full of envy, murder,” for the latter of these comes
from the former, as was shown in Abel’s case and Joseph’s, and then
after saying, “debate, deceit, malignity;”

<span id="vii.vii-p10"></span>[Rom.
1.30](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#030.md)<span id="vii.vii-p10.1"></span>.
“Whisperers, backbiters, haters of God, despiteful,” and classing things
which to many seem indifferent among his charges, he further strengthens
his accusation, going up to the stronghold of their wickednesses, and
styles them “boasters.” For even worse than sinning is it, even though
sinning to be haughty-minded. Wherefore also he charges the Corinthians
with it, saying, “Ye are puffed up.” (<span id="vii.vii-p10.2"></span>[1
Cor. v. 2](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#002.md)<span
id="vii.vii-p10.3"></span>.) For if in a good action he that puffs
himself up loseth all, if any one do so among his sins, what vengeance
is there of which he is not worthy, since such an one cannot repent any
more? Next, he says, “inventors of evil things;” showing that they were
not content with those already existing, but even invented others. And
this again is like men that are full purposed and in earnest, not those
that are hurried away and forced out of their course; and after
mentioning the several kinds of maliciousness, and showing that here too
they stood against nature itself (for he says, “disobedient to
parents”), he then goes on to the root of the great pestilence, calling
them,

<span id="vii.vii-p11"></span>[Rom.
1.31](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#031.md)<span id="vii.vii-p11.1"></span>.
“Without natural affection, implacable.”

<span id="vii.vii-p12"></span>For this Christ Himself also pronounces to
be the cause of wickedness, saying, “When iniquity shall abound, the
love of many shall wax cold.” ([Matt. xxiv.
12](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#012)<span id="vii.vii-p12.1"></span>.md).
This too St. Paul here says, calling them “covenant-breakers, without
natural affection, implacable, unmerciful,” and showing that they were
traitors even to the gift of nature. For we have a sort of family
feeling even by nature towards one another, which even beasts have got
towards each other. “For every beast,” it says, “loveth his like, and
every man his neighbor.” ([Ecclesiasticus
13.15](../../../bib/apo/sir013.htm#015.md)<span
id="vii.vii-p12.2"></span>.) But these became more ferocious even than
they. The disorder then which resulted to the world by evil doctrines,
he proves to us by these witnesses, and clearly shows that the malady in
either case came of the negligence of them that were disordered. He
shows besides, what he did in the case of the doctrines, that they were
here also deprived of all excuse; and so he says,

<span id="vii.vii-p13"></span>[Rom.
1.32](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#032.md)<span id="vii.vii-p13.1"></span>.
“Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are
worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do
them.”

<span id="vii.vii-p14"></span>Having assumed here two objections, he in
the first place removes them. For what reason have you to say, he means,
that you know not the things which ought to be done? At best, even if
you did not know, you are to blame in having left God who instructs you.
But as it is by many arguments we have shown that you do know, and
transgress willingly. But are you drawn by passion? Why then do you both
coöperate therewith and praise it? For they “not only do such things,”
he says, “but have pleasure in them that do them.” Having then put the
more grievous and the unpardonable sin first, that he might have done
with it (Or “convict you of it,” <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.vii-p14.1"></span>ἵ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.vii-p14.2"></span>να ἑλῃ</span>); (for he that praiseth the sin
is far worse than even he that trespasseth;) having then put this the
first, he by this method grapples more powerfully with him in the
sequel, speaking on this wise,

<span id="vii.vii-p15"></span>[Rom.
2.1](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#001.md)<span id="vii.vii-p15.1"></span>.
“Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man; whosoever thou art that judgest;
for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself.”

<span id="vii.vii-p16"></span>These things he says, with an aim at the
rulers, inasmuch as that city then had the rule of the world put into
its hands. <span id="fr_1232"></span>[1233](#fn_1232.md) He anticipated
them therefore by saying, Thou art depriving thyself of defence, whoever
thou mayest be; for when thou condemnest an adulterer, and thyself
committest adultery, although no man condemneth thee, in thy judgment
upon the guilty person thou hast also passed sentence against thyself.

<span id="vii.vii-p18"></span>[Rom.
2.2](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#002.md)<span id="vii.vii-p18.1"></span>.
“For we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against
them who commit such things.”

<span id="vii.vii-p19"></span>For lest any should say, until now I have
escaped, to make him afraid, he says, that it is not so with God as it
is here. For here (Plato in *Theæt. et Phædon.*) one is punished, and
another escapes while doing the same thing. But hereafter it is not so.
That he that judgeth then knoweth the right, he has said: but whence he
knoweth it, he hath not added; for it was superfluous. For in the case
of ungodliness, he shows both that the ungodly was so even with a
knowledge of God, and also whence he got that knowledge, namely, from
the Creation. For inasmuch as it was not plain to all, he gave the cause
also; but here he passes it over as a thing admitted. But when he says,
“whosoever thou art that judgest,” he is not addressing himself to the
rulers only, but to private individuals and subjects also. For all men,
even if they have no chair of state, nor executioners, nor stocks at
command, yet even they judge those that offend, in conversations and
public meetings (Gr. <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.vii-p19.1"></span>κοινοἵς συλλόγοις</span>) and by the vote of
their conscience. And no one would venture to say, that the adulterer
does not deserve punishment. But it is others, he says, they condemn,
and not themselves. And for this cause he stands forth vehemently
against them, and says,

<span id="vii.vii-p20"></span>[Rom.
2.3](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#003.md)<span id="vii.vii-p20.1"></span>.
“And thinkest thou this” (4 <span class="c14"><span
id="vii.vii-p20.2"></span>mss.</span> om. this), “O man, that judgest
those which do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape
the judgment of God?”

<span id="vii.vii-p21"></span>For since he had shown the sin of the
world to be great, from its doctrines, from its doings, and that they
did yet sin though wise, and though they had the creation to lead them
by the hand, and not by leaving God only, but also by choosing the
images of creeping things, and by their dishonoring virtue, and
deserting, in spite of nature’s drawings back, to the service of vice
even contrary to nature: he goes on next to show, that they who do such
things are punished too. He did indeed at once point out a punishment by
mentioning their very practice. For “they received,” he says, “in
themselves that recompense of their error which was meet.” But as they
do not perceive that, he mentions another also, which they stood most in
fear of. And indeed already he chiefly pointed at this. For when he
says, “That the judgment of God is according to truth,” he is speaking
of no other than this. But he establishes the same again upon other
further grounds, saying thus, “And thinkest thou this, O man, that
judgest them which do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt
escape the judgment of God?” Thou hast not been acquitted of thine own
judgment, and wilt thou escape through God’s? Who indeed would say this?
And yet thou hast judged thyself (3 <span class="c14"><span
id="vii.vii-p21.1"></span>mss.</span> “and not been acquitted”). But
since the rigorousness of the judgment-court was such, and thou wert not
able to spare even thyself, how should not God, that cannot do amiss,
and who is in the highest sense just, be much surer to do the same? But
hast thou condemned thyself, and is God to approve of thee and praise
thee? And how can this be reasonable? And all the while thou art
deserving of a greater punishment, than he who is of thee condemned. For
sinning merely, is not the same thing with falling again into the same
sins you have chastised another for committing. See, how he has
strengthened the charge! For if you, he means, punish a person who has
committed less sins, though by it you will put yourself to shame, how
shall not God cast you in your suit, and condemn you more severely, who
have committed greater transgressions, and this too when He will never
make Himself ashamed, and you are already condemned by your own
reckoning. But if thou say, I know that I deserve punishment; yet
through His long-suffering thinkest slightingly of it, and art confident
because thou dost not suffer punishment forthwith; this surely is a
reason why thou oughtest to be afraid and tremble. For the fact that
thou hast not yet suffered punishment, will not result in thy not
suffering any punishment, but in thy suffering a more severe one if thou
abidest unamended. <span id="fr_1233"></span>[1234](#fn_1233.md) And so he
goes on to say:

<span id="vii.vii-p23"></span>[Rom.
2.4](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#004.md)<span id="vii.vii-p23.1"></span>.
“Or despiseth thou the riches of His goodness and forbearance and
long-sufferring; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to
repentance?”

<span id="vii.vii-p24"></span>For after praising God’s long-suffering,
showing the gain thereof to be very great to them that heeded it (and
this was the drawing sinners to repentance); he adds to the terror. For
as to them, who avail themselves of it aright, it is a ground of safety;
so to them that slight it, it is conducive to a greater vengeance. For
whenever you utter this common notion, that God doth not exact justice,
because He is good and long-suffering, he says, You do but mention what
will make the vengeance intenser. For God showeth His goodness that you
may get free from your sins, not that you may add to them. If then thou
make not this use thereof, the judgment will be more fearful. Wherefore
it is a chief ground for abstaining from sin, that God is
long-suffering, and not for making the benefit a plea for obstinacy. For
if He be long-suffering, He most certainly punisheth. Whence does this
appear? from what is next said. For if the wickedness be great and the
wicked have not been requited, it is absolutely necessary that they
should be requited. For if men do not overlook these things, how should
God make an oversight? And so from this point he introduces the subject
of the judgment. For the fact of showing many who, if they repent not,
are liable, yet still are not punished here, introduces with it
necessarily the judgment, and that with increase. Wherefore he says,

<span id="vii.vii-p25"></span>[Rom.
2.5](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#005.md)<span id="vii.vii-p25.1"></span>.
“But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself
wrath.”

<span id="vii.vii-p26"></span>For when a man is neither to be softened
by goodness nor to be turned back by fear, what can be harder than such
an one? For after that he had showed the goodness of God towards men, he
then shows His vengeance that it is unbearable for him who <span
id="fr_1234"></span>[1235](#fn_1234.md) does not even so return to
repentance. And observe with what propriety he uses the words! “Thou
treasurest up unto thyself wrath,” he says, so making it plain what is
certainly laid up, and showing that it is not He that judgeth, but he
that is condemned, who is the author of this. For he says, “thou
treasurest up for thyself,” not God for thee. For He did all, whatsoever
things were fitting, and created thee with a power to discern between
good and what was not so, and showed long-suffering over thee, and
called thee to repentance, and threatened a fearful day, so by every
means drawing thee to repentance. But if thou shouldst continue
unyielding, “thou treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of
wrath and revelation and (so all <span class="c14"><span
id="vii.vii-p27.2"></span>mss.</span> but two) the righteous judgment of
God.” For lest on hearing of wrath thou shouldest think of any passion,
he adds, “the righteous judgment of God.” And he said “revelation” with
good reason, for then is this revealed when each man receives his
desert. For here many men often annoy and practise harm to one without
justice. But hereafter it is not so.

<span id="vii.vii-p28"></span>[Rom.
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#006.md),
[7](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#007.md)<span id="vii.vii-p28.1"></span>.
“Who will render to every man according to his deeds, to them who by
patient continuance in well doing,” etc.

<span id="vii.vii-p29"></span>Since he had become awestriking and harsh
by discoursing of the judgment and of the punishment that shall be, he
does not forthwith, as one might expect, enter upon the vengeance, but
turns his discourse to what was sweeter, to the recompense of good
actions, saying as follows,

<span id="vii.vii-p30"></span>[Rom.
2.7](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#007.md)<span id="vii.vii-p30.1"></span>.
“To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and
honor and immortality, eternal life.”

<span id="vii.vii-p31"></span>Here also he awakens those who had drawn
back during the trials, and shows that it is not right to trust in faith
only. For it is deeds also into which that tribunal will enquire. But
observe, how when he is discoursing about the things to come, he is
unable to tell clearly the blessings, but speaketh of glory and honor.
For in that they transcend all that man hath, he hath no image of them
taken from this to show, but by those things which have a semblance of
brightness among us, even by them he sets them before us as far as may
be, by glory, by honor, by life. For these be what men earnestly strive
after, yet are those things not these, but much better than these,
inasmuch as they are incorruptible and immortal. See how he has opened
to us the doors toward the resurrection of the body by speaking of
incorruptibility. For incorruptibility belongs to the corruptible body.
Then, since this sufficed not, he added glory and honor. For all of us
are to rise incorruptible, but not all to glory, but some to punishment,
and some to life.

<span id="vii.vii-p32"></span>[Rom.
2.8](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#008.md)<span id="vii.vii-p32.1"></span>.
“But unto them that are contentious,” <span
id="fr_1235"></span>[1236](#fn_1235.md) he says. Again, he deprives of
excuse those that live in wickedness, and shows that it is from a kind
of disputatiousness and carelessness that they fall into
unrighteousness.

<span id="vii.vii-p34"></span>“And do not obey the truth, but obey
unrighteousness.” See, here is another accusation again. For what
defence can he set up, who flees from the light and chooses the dark?
And he does not say, who are “compelled by,” “lorded over by,” but who
“obey unrighteousness,” that one may learn that the fall is one of free
choice, the crime not of necessity.

<span id="vii.vii-p35"></span>[Rom.
2.9](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#009.md)<span id="vii.vii-p35.1"></span>.
“Indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man
that doeth evil.”

<span id="vii.vii-p36"></span>That is, if a man be rich, if a consul, if
a very sovereign (so Field: several <span class="c14"><span
id="vii.vii-p36.1"></span>mss.</span> and Edd. “the emperor himself”),
by none of them is the account of the judgment out-faced. Since in this
dignities have no place. Having then shown the exceeding greatness of
the disease, and having added the cause, that it was from the
carelessness of the disordered, and finally, that destruction awaits
them and that amendment is easy, in the punishment also he again gives
the Jew the heavier lot. For he that had enjoyed a larger share of
instruction would also deserve to undergo a larger share of vengeance if
doing lawlessly. And so the wiser or mightier men we are, the more are
we punished if we sin. For if thou art rich, thou wilt have more money
demanded of thee than of the poor; and if wiser than others, a stricter
obedience; and if thou hast been invested with authority, more shining
acts of goodness; and so in the case of all the other things, thou wilt
have to bring in measures proportioned to your power.

<span id="vii.vii-p37"></span>[Rom.
2.10](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#010.md)<span id="vii.vii-p37.1"></span>.
“But glory, honor, and peace to every man that worketh good, to the Jew
first, and also to the Gentile.”

<span id="vii.vii-p38"></span>What Jew does he here mean? or about what
Gentiles is he discoursing? It is of those before Christ’s coming. For
his discourse had not hitherto come to the times of grace, but he was
still dwelling upon the earlier times, so breaking down first from afar
off and clearing away the separation between the Greek and the Jew, that
when he should do this in the matter of grace, he might no more seem to
be devising some new and degrading view. For if in the earlier times
when this Grace had not shone forth in such greatness, when the estate
of the Jews was solemn and renowned and glorious before all men, there
was no difference, what could they say for themselves (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.vii-p38.1"></span>τίνα ἂν ἔχοιεν λόγον
εἰπεἵν</span>;) now after so great a display of grace? And this is why
he establishes it with so great earnestness. For when the hearer has
been informed that this held in the earlier times, much more will he
receive it after the faith. But by Greeks he here means not them that
worshipped idols, but them that adored God, that obeyed the law of
nature, that strictly kept all things, save the Jewish observances,
which contribute to piety, such as were Melchizedek and his (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.vii-p38.2"></span>οἱ περὶ</span>), such as
was Job, such as were the Ninevites, such as was Cornelius. Here then he
is first breaking through the partition between the circumcision and the
uncircumcision: and at a distance dissipates this distinction
beforehand, so as to do it without being suspected, and to strike into
it as compelled by another occasion, which is ever a characteristic of
his Apostolic wisdom. For if he had showed it in the times of grace,
what he said would have had a very suspicious look. But on describing
the vice which possessed the world, and where end the ways of
wickedness, to pass from that consecutively into the treatment of these
points renders his teaching unsuspected. And that he means this, and for
this purpose so put this together, is plain from hence: for if he were
not intent upon effecting this, it were enough for him to have said,
“According to thy hardness and impenitent heart thou treasurest up unto
thyself wrath against the day of wrath;” and then to have dropped this
subject, since it would have been complete. But in that what he had in
view was not to speak of the judgment to come only, but to show also
that the Jew had no advantage of such a Greek, and so was not to be
haughty-spirited, he advances farther, and speaks <span
id="fr_1236"></span>[1237](#fn_1236.md) of them in order. But consider! He
had put the hearer in fear, had advanced <span
id="fr_1237"></span>[1238](#fn_1237.md) against him the fearful day, had
told him what an evil it is to be living in wickedness, had showed him
that no man sinneth of ignorance, nor with impunity, but that even
though he suffer no punishment now, yet he certainly will suffer it:
then he wishes to make good next that the teaching of the Law was not a
thing of great importance. For it is upon works that both punishment and
reward depend, not upon circumcision and uncircumcision. Since then he
had said, that the Gentile shall by no means go unpunished and had taken
this for granted, and upon it had made good that he shall also be
rewarded, he next showed the Law and circumcision to be superfluous. For
it is the Jews that he is here chiefly opposing. For inasmuch as they
were somewhat captiously disposed, first, of their haughtiness, not
deigning to be reckoned along with the Gentiles, and secondly thinking
it ridiculous if the faith is to do away all sins; for this cause he
accused the Gentiles first, in whose behalf he is speaking, that without
suspicion and with boldness of speech, he may attack the Jews. And then
having come to the enquiry concerning the punishment, he shows that the
Jew is so far from being at all profited by the Law, that he is even
weighed down by it. And this was his drift some way back. For if the
Gentile be on this score inexcusable, because, when the creation led him
on and his own reasonings, he yet did not amend, much more were the Jew
so, who besides these had the teaching of the Law also. Having then
persuaded him to a ready admission of these reasonings, in the case of
other men’s sins, he now compels him even against his will to do so in
the case of his own. And in order that what he says may be more readily
allowed, he leads him forward with the better things also in view,
speaking on this wise: “But glory and honor and peace to every man that
worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile.” For here
whatever good things a man hath, he hath with fightings, even if he be
rich, if a prince, if a king. Even if he be not at variance with others,
yet is he often so with himself, and has abundant war in his own
thoughts. But there it is no such thing, but all is still and void of
trouble, and in possession of true peace. Having then made good from
what was said above, that they too which have not the Law are to enjoy
the same blessings, he adds his reason in the following words:

<span id="vii.vii-p41"></span>[Rom.
2.11](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#011.md)<span id="vii.vii-p41.1"></span>.
“For there is no respect of persons with God.”

<span id="vii.vii-p42"></span>For when he says that as well the Jew as
the Gentile is punished if he sin, he needs no reasonings: but when he
wants to prove that the Gentile is honored also, he then needs a
foundation for it also; as it seemed wonderful and extravagant if he who
had heard neither Law nor Prophets, were to be honored upon his working
good. And this is why (as I also said before) he exercises their hearing
in the times before grace, that he might afterwards more treatably bring
in, along with the faith, the acquiescence in these things also. For
here he is not at all suspected, as seeming not to be making his own
point good. Having then said, “Glory and honor and peace to every man
that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile,” he adds,
“For there is no respect of persons with God.” Wonderful! What more than
victory has he gained! For he shows, by reducing it to an absurdity,
that it was not meet with God that it should be otherwise. For it would
then be a case of respecting of persons. But of such character God is
not. And he does not say, “for if this were not so, God would be a
respecter of persons,” but with more of dignity, “For there is no
respect of persons with God.” That it is not quality of persons, but
difference of actions. Which He maketh inquisition for. By so saying he
shows that it was not in actions but in persons only that the Jew
differed from the Gentile. The consequence of this would be thus
expressed; For it is not because one is a Jew and the other a Gentile,
that one is honored and the other disgraced, but it is from the works
that either treatment comes. But he does not say so, since it would have
roused the anger of the Jew, but he sets down something more, so
bringing their haughty spirit yet lower, and quelling it for the
admission of the other. But what is this? The next position.

<span id="vii.vii-p43"></span>[Rom.
2.12](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#012.md)<span id="vii.vii-p43.1"></span>.
“For as many,” he says, “as have sinned without law shall also perish
without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by
the law.”

<span id="vii.vii-p44"></span>For here, as I said before, he shows not
only the equality of the Jew and the Gentile, but that the Jew was even
much burdened by the gift of the Law. For the Gentile is judged without
law. But this “without law” (Gr. lawlessly) here expresses not the worse
plight but the easier, that is, he has not the Law to accuse him. For
“without law” (that is, without the condemnation arising from it), is he
condemned solely from the reasonings of nature, but the Jew, “in the
Law,” that is, with nature and the Law too to accuse him. For the
greater the attention he enjoyed, the greater the punishment he will
suffer. See how much greater is the necessity which he lays upon the
Jews of a speedy recourse to grace! For in that they said, they needed
not grace, being justified by the Law, he shows that they need it more
than the Gentiles, considering they are liable to be punished more. Then
he adds another reason again, and so farther contends for what has been
said. <span id="fr_1238"></span>[1239](#fn_1238.md)

<span id="vii.vii-p46"></span>[Rom.
2.13](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#013.md)<span id="vii.vii-p46.1"></span>.
“For not the hearers of the law are just before God.”

<span id="vii.vii-p47"></span>Well doth he add “before God;” for haply
before men they may be able to appear dignified and to vaunt great
things, but before God it is quite otherwise—the doers of the Law alone
are justified. You see with what advantage he combats, by turning what
they said to an opposite bearing. For if it is by the Law you claim to
be saved, in this respect, saith he, the Gentile will stand before
you, <span id="fr_1239"></span>[1240](#fn_1239.md) when seen to be a doer
of what is written in the Law. And how is it possible (one may say) for
one who hath not heard to be a doer? Not this only, he says, is
possible, but what is much more even than this. For not only is it
possible without hearing to be a doer, but even with hearing not to be
so. Which last thing he makes plainer, and that with a greater advantage
over them, when he says, “Thou that teachest another, teachest thou not
thyself?” (<span id="vii.vii-p48.3"></span>[Rom. ii.
21](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#021)<span id="vii.vii-p48.4"></span>..md)
But here he is still making the former point good.

<span id="vii.vii-p49"></span>[Rom.
2.14](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#014.md)<span id="vii.vii-p49.1"></span>.
“For when the Gentiles,” he says, “which have not the law, do by nature
the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law
unto themselves.”

<span id="vii.vii-p50"></span>I am not, he means, rejecting the Law, but
even on this score I justify the Gentiles. You see how when undermining
the conceit of Judaism, he giveth no handle against himself as
villifying the Law, but on the contrary by extolling it and showing its
greatness he so makes good his whole position. But whenever he saith “by
nature,” he means by the reasonings of nature. And he shows that others
are better than they, and, what is more better for this, that they have
not received the Law, and have not that wherein the Jews seem to have an
advantage over them. For on this ground he means they are to be admired,
because they required not a law, and yet exhibited all the doings of the
Law, having the works, not the letters, graven upon their minds. For
this is what he says,

<span id="vii.vii-p51"></span>[Rom.
2.15](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#015.md)<span id="vii.vii-p51.1"></span>.
“Which show the work of the Law written in their hearts, their
conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the meanwhile
accusing or else excusing one another.”

<span id="vii.vii-p52"></span>[Rom.
2.16](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#016.md)<span id="vii.vii-p52.1"></span>.
“In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ,
according to my Gospel.”

<span id="vii.vii-p53"></span>See how he again puts that day before
them, and brings it close to them, battering down their conceit, and
showing, that those were to be the rather honored who without the Law
strove earnestly to fulfil the things of the Law. But what is most to be
marvelled at in the discretion of the Apostle, it is worth while to
mention now. For having shown, from the grounds given, that the Gentile
is greater than the Jew; in the inference, and the conclusion of his
reasoning, he does not state it, in order not to exasperate the Jew. But
to make what I have said clearer, I will give the very words of the
Apostle. For after saying, that it is not the hearers of the Law, but
the doers of the Law, that shall be justified, it followed to say, “For
when the Gentiles, which have not the Law, do by nature the things
contained in the Law,” they are much better than those who are
instructed by the Law. But this he does not say, but he stays at the
encomium of the Gentiles, and does not yet awhile carry on his discourse
by way of comparison, that so at least the Jew may receive what is said.
And so he does not word it as I was doing, but how? “For when the
Gentiles, which have not the Law, do by nature the things contained in
the Law, these, not having the Law, are a law unto themselves; which
show the work of the Law, written in their hearts, their conscience also
bearing witness.” For the conscience and reason doth suffice in the
Law’s stead. By this he showed, first, that God made man
independent, <span id="fr_1240"></span>[1241](#fn_1240.md) so as to be able
to choose virtue and to avoid vice. And be not surprised that he proves
this point, not once or twice, but several times. For this topic was
very needful for him to prove owing to those who say, Why ever is it,
that Christ came but now? And where in times before was the (most <span
class="c14"><span id="vii.vii-p54.3"></span>mss.</span> this mighty)
scheme of Providence? Now it is these that he is at present beating off
by the way, when he shows that even in former times, and before the Law
was given, the human race (Gr. nature) fully enjoyed the care of
Providence. For “that which may be known of God was manifest in them,”
and they knew what was good, and what bad; by means whereof they judged
others, which he reproaches them with, when he says, “wherein thou
judgest another, thou condemnest thyself.” But in the case of the Jews,
besides what has been mentioned, there was the Law, and not reason or
conscience only. And why does he put the words “accusing or else
excusing?”—for, if they have a Law written, and show the work of it in
them, how comes reason to be able to accuse them still? But he is not
any longer speaking of those only who do well, but also of mankind (Gr.
the nature) universally. For then our reasonings stand up, some accusing
and some excusing. And at that tribunal a man needeth no other accuser.
Then to add to their fear, he does not say the sins of men, but the
secrets of men. For since he said, “Thinkest thou, that judgest them
that do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the
judgment of God;” that thou mayest not expect such a sentence as thou
passest thyself, but mayest know, that that of God is far more exact
than thine own, he brings in, “the secrets of men,” and adds, “through
Jesus Christ according to my Gospel.” For men sit in judgment upon overt
acts alone. And above too he spake of the Father alone, but as soon as
he had crushed them with fear, he brought in the mention of Christ also.
But he does not do barely this, but even here, after having made mention
of the Father, he so introduceth Him. And by the same things he raises
the dignity of his preaching. For this preaching, he means, openly
speaks out what nature taught by anticipation. Do you see with what
wisdom he has bound them both to the Gospel and to Christ, and
demonstrated that our affairs come not here to a stand, but travel
further. And this he made good before also, when he said, “thou
treasurest up to thyself wrath against the day of wrath:” and here
again, “God shall judge the secrets of men.”

<span id="vii.vii-p55"></span>Now let each man enter into his own
conscience, and reckoning up his transgressions, let him call himself to
a strict account, that we be not then condemned with the world. ([1 Cor.
xi. 32](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#032.md)<span
id="vii.vii-p55.1"></span>.) For fearful is that court, awful the
tribunal, full of trembling the accounts, a river of fire rolls along
(<span class="Greek"><span id="vii.vii-p55.2"></span>ἕ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.vii-p55.3"></span>λκεται</span>). “A brother
doth not redeem: shall man redeem?” ([Ps.
49:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#007.md),
[8](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#008.md)<span id="vii.vii-p55.4"></span>[Ps.
xlix. 8](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#008.md)<span
id="vii.vii-p55.5"></span>. LXX.) Call then to mind what is said in the
Gospel, the Angels running to and fro, of the bridechamber being shut,
of the lamps going out, of the powers which drag to the furnaces. And
consider this, that if a secret deed of any one of us were brought forth
into the midst, to-day, before the Church only, what could he do but
pray to perish, and to have the earth to gape for him, rather than have
so many witnesses of his wickedness? How then shall we feel, when,
before the whole world, all things are brought into the midst, in a
theatre so bright and open, with both those known and those unknown to
us seeing into everything? But alas! wherewith am I forced to affright
you! with men’s estimation! when I ought to use the fear of God, and His
condemnation. For what, pray, is to become of us then when bound, and
gnashing our teeth, we are led away to the outer darkness? Or, rather,
what shall we do (and this is the most fearful thought of all) when we
offend (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.vii-p55.6"></span>προσκρούσωμεν</span>) God? For if any one have
sense and reason, he has already endured a hell when he is out of sight
of God. But since this doth not pain, fire is therefore threatened. For
we ought to smart not when we are punished, but when we sin. Thus listen
to Paul wailing and lamenting over sins, for which he was not to be
punished. For “I am not meet,” he says, “to be called an Apostle,
because I persecuted the Church.” ([1 Cor. xv.
9](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#009)<span id="vii.vii-p55.7"></span>..md)
Hear also David, when he is set free from the punishment, yet, as
thinking that he had offended God, calling vengeance down upon himself,
and saying, “Let thy hand be upon me and upon my father’s house.” (<span
id="vii.vii-p55.8"></span>[2 Sam. xxiv.
17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#017)<span id="vii.vii-p55.9"></span>..md)
For to have offended God is more distressing than to be punished. But
now we are so wretchedly disposed, that, were there no fear of hell, we
should not even choose readily to do any good thing. Wherefore were it
for nothing else, yet for this at least, we should deserve hell, because
we fear hell more than Christ (several <span class="c14"><span
id="vii.vii-p55.10"></span>mss</span>. God). But not so the blessed
Paul, but contrariwise. But since we feel otherwise, for this reason are
we condemned to hell: since, did we but love Christ as we should love
Him, we should have known that to offend Him we love were more painful
than hell. But since we love Him not, we know not the greatness of His
punishment. And this is what I bewail and grieve over the most! And yet
what has God not done, to be beloved of us? What hath He not devised?
What hath He omitted? We insulted Him, when He had not wronged us in
aught, but had even benefited us with blessings countless and
unspeakable. We have turned aside from Him when calling and drawing us
to Him by all ways, yet hath He not even upon this punished us, but hath
run Himself unto us, and held us back, when fleeing, and we have shaken
Him off and leaped away to the Devil. And not even on this hath He stood
aloof, but hath sent numberless messengers to call us to Him again,
Prophets, Angels, <span id="fr_1241"></span>[1242](#fn_1241.md) Patriarchs:
and we have not only not received the embassy, but have even insulted
those that came. But not even for this did He spew us out of His mouth,
but like those slighted lovers that be very earnest, He went round
beseeching all, the heaven, the earth, Jeremiah, Micah, and that not
that He might weigh us down, but that He might speak in behalf of His
own ways ([Isa. 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#002.md), [Jer.
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#012.md), [Jer.
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#012.md), [Mic.
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#001.md)<span
id="vii.vii-p56.1"></span>[Is. i.
2](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#002.md)<span id="vii.vii-p56.2"></span>;
[Jer. ii. 12](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#012.md)<span
id="vii.vii-p56.3"></span>; iii. 12; etc.; [Mic. vi.
1](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#001)<span id="vii.vii-p56.4"></span>.md):
and along with the prophets He went also Himself to those that turned
aside from Him, being ready to submit to examination, and deigning to
condescend to a conference, and drawing them that were deaf to every
appeal into a disputation with Himself. For He saith, “O my people, what
have I done unto thee, and wherein have I wearied thee? Answer me.”
(<span id="vii.vii-p56.5"></span>[Mic. vi.
3](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#003)<span id="vii.vii-p56.6"></span>..md)
After all this we killed the Prophets, we stoned them, we did them other
cruel wrongs without number. What then? In their place He sent no longer
Prophets, no longer Angels, no longer Patriarchs, but the Son Himself.
He too was killed when He had come, and yet not even then did He quench
His love, but kindled it even more, and keepeth on beseeching us, after
even His own Son was killed, and entreating us, and doing all things to
turn us unto Himself. And Paul crieth aloud, saying, “Now then we are
ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: be ye
reconciled to God.” (<span id="vii.vii-p56.7"></span>[2 Cor. v.
20](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#020)<span id="vii.vii-p56.8"></span>..md)
None of these things however reconciled us. Yet not even then did He
leave us, but keeps on both threatening hell, and promising a kingdom,
that even so He may draw us unto Himself. But we be still in an
insensible mood. What can be worse than this brutishness? For had a man
done these things, should we not many times over have let ourselves
become slaves to him? But God when doing so we turn us away from! O what
listlessness! O what unfeelingness! We that live continually in sins and
wickednesses, if we happen to do any little good, like unfeeling
domestics, with what a niggardly spirit do we exact it, and how
particular are we about the recompense made, if what we have done has
any recompense to come of it. And yet the recompense is the greater if
you do it without any hope of reward. Why saying all this, and making
exact reckoning, is language fitter for an hireling than a domestic of
willing mind. For we ought to do everything for Christ’s sake, not for
the reward, but for Him. For this also was why He threatened hell and
promised the kingdom, that He might be loved of us. Let us then so love
Him as we ought to love Him. For this is the great reward, this is
royalty and pleasure, this is enjoyment, and glory, and honor, this is
light, this is the great happiness, <span
id="fr_1242"></span>[1243](#fn_1242) which language (or reasoning.md)
cannot set before us, nor mind conceive. Yet indeed I do not know how I
was led so far in this way of speaking, and came to be exhorting men who
do not even think slightly of power and glory here for Christ’s sake, to
think slightly of the kingdom. Yet still those great and noble men even
attained to this measure of love. Hear, for instance, how Peter burns
with love towards Him, setting Him before soul, and life, and all
things. And when he had denied Him, it was not the punishment he was
grieved for, but that he had denied Him Whom he longed for, which was
more bitter to him than any punishment. And all this did he show before
the grace of the Spirit was given. <span
id="fr_1243"></span>[1244](#fn_1243.md) And he perseveringly pressed the
question, “Whither goest thou?” (<span id="vii.vii-p58.2"></span>[John
xiii. 36](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#036.md)<span
id="vii.vii-p58.3"></span>) and before this; “To whom shall we go?”
([John 6.67](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#067.md)<span
id="vii.vii-p58.4"></span>); and again; “I will follow Thee
whithersoever Thou goest.” ([Luke xxii.
33](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#033)<span id="vii.vii-p58.5"></span>?.md)
Thus He was all things to them, and neither heaven nor the kingdom of
heaven did they count of, in comparison of Him they longed for. For Thou
art all these things unto me, he means. And why doest thou marvel that
Peter was so minded? Hear now what the Prophet says: “What have I in
heaven, and what is there upon earth, that I should desire in comparison
of Thee?” (<span id="vii.vii-p58.6"></span>[Ps. lxxiii.
25](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#025)<span id="vii.vii-p58.7"></span>..md)
Now what he means is nearly this. Neither of things above nor of things
below desire I any, save Thee only. This is passion; <span
id="fr_1244"></span>[1245](#fn_1244.md) this is love. Can we so love, it
will not be things present only, but even things to come, which we shall
reckon as nothing compared with that love-charm, and even here shall we
enjoy the Kingdom, delighting ourselves in the love of Him. And how is
this to be? one may say. Let us reflect how oft we insult Him after
numberless goodnesses, yet He standeth and calleth us to Him, and how
often we run by Him, but He still doth not overlook us, but runneth to
us, and draweth us to Him, and catcheth us in unto Himself. For if we
consider these things, and such as these, we shall be enabled to kindle
this longing. For if it were a common man that so loved, but a king who
was thus beloved, would he not feel a respect for the greatness of the
love? Most assuredly he would. But when the case is reversed, and His
Beauty (S. “that beauty”) is unspeakable, and the glory and the riches
too of Him that loveth us, and our vileness so great, surely we deserve
the utmost punishment, vile as we are and outcasts, who are treated with
so exceeding great love by One so great and wonderful, and yet wax
wanton against His love? He needeth not anything of ours, and yet He
doth not even now cease loving us. We need much what is His, and for all
that we cleave not unto His love, but money we value above Him, and
man’s friendship, and ease of body, and power, and fame, before Him who
valueth nothing more than us. For He had One Son, Very (Lit.
“true-born”) and Only-Begotten, and He spared not even Him for us. But
we value many things above Him. Were there not then good reason for a
hell and torment, even were it twofold or threefold or manifold what it
is? For what can we have to say for ourselves, if even Satan’s
injunctions we value more than the Laws of Christ, and are reckless of
our own salvation that we may choose the works of wickedness, before Him
who suffered all things for us? And what pardon do these things deserve?
what excuse have they? Not one even. (5 <span class="c14"><span
id="vii.vii-p59.1"></span>mss.</span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.vii-p59.2"></span>οὐδὲ μιἵς</span>.) Let us stop then after this
in our headlong course, and let us grow again sober; and reckoning up
all these things, let us send up glory unto Him by our works (for words
alone suffice not thereto), that we may also enjoy the glory that cometh
of Him, which may we all attain unto by the grace and love toward man of
our Lord Jesus Christ, through Whom, and with Whom, to the Father be
glory, with the Holy Spirit, for ever and ever. Amen.

id="vii.vii-p5.5"></span>

<span id="vii.vii-p6"></span> Chrys. is correct in denying that Paul
refers sin to the flesh (in the sense of the *body*), as its cause and
seat. With the apostle <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.vii-p6.1"></span>σάρξ</span> is not the same as <span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.vii-p6.2"></span>σῶμα</span> in its relation
to sin. <span class="Greek"><span id="vii.vii-p6.3"></span>Σάρξ</span>
comprehends the whole unregenerate man and not merely his body or the
impulses and passions connected with his physical life. It is true that
Paul regards the body as the sphere in which sin makes many of its worst
manifestations. It may be due to this that he chose the word <span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.vii-p6.4"></span>σάρξ</span> to denote
unrenewed human nature. With Paul the cause and seat of sin are in the
will. He nowhere identifies evil with the body and therefore lays no
basis for asceticism or for the contempt or ill-treatment of the body.
Of the “works of the flesh” which he enumerates in <span
id="vii.vii-p6.5"></span>[Gal. v.
19-21](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#019.md)<span id="vii.vii-p6.6"></span>
more than half are sins having no special relation to the body and not
manifesting themselves through physical appetites or passions, as, e.g.
“idolatry, enmities, jealousies, divisions, heresies.”—G.B.S.

<span id="fn_1231"></span>[i:1232](1110068.htm#fr_1231.md) <span

in the text, here seems to be used with a consciousness of its
etymology, as St. Paul plays on the word in <span class="Greek"><span

<span id="fn_1232"></span>[i:1233](1110068.htm#fr_1232.md) <span

<span id="vii.vii-p17"></span> The author seems here to overlook the
fact that Paul at the beginning of ch. ii. turns to the Jews. Chrys.
speaks as if he were now addressing specifically “rulers.” But as the
argument goes on, the language shows more and more clearly that he is
here thinking of the Jewish world (see [Rom.
2.12-17](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#012.md)<span
id="vii.vii-p17.1"></span>). The “therefore” grounds the fact of
universal condemnation upon the description of sin as universal,
contained in [Rom. 1.18-32](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#018.md)<span
id="vii.vii-p17.2"></span>. The only peculiarity is that the statement
that this picture of Gentile depravity is a picture of universal
application, is made afterwards, “For wherein,” etc. The argument
proceeds as if after [Rom. 1.32](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#032.md)<span
id="vii.vii-p17.3"></span> the apostle had been interrupted with the
objection, “But your description does not apply to us.” The apostle
answers: “It does, for you do the same things.” The “therefore” is
proleptic so far as it assumes as shown what he now asserts: <span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.vii-p17.4"></span>τὰ γὰρ ἀυτὰ πράσσεις ὁ
κρίνων</span>. The conclusion is thus stated before the major
premiss.—G.B.S.

“For it is not that thou shouldst not suffer any punishment, but that
thou mayest suffer a worse if thou abide unamended, that He delayeth—and
may that never befall thee.”

<span id="vii.vii-p27"></span> Or, “he” (St. Paul, according to Field)
“is terribly severe upon him who:” for most <span class="c14"><span

assigns the ground of [Rom. 2.11](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#011.md)<span
id="vii.vii-p45.2"></span>. “Sin brings penalty and death whether
committed under the Mosaic law or under the ethical law of conscience.”
The first member of the sentence ([Rom.
2.12](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#012)<span id="vii.vii-p45.3"></span>.md)
applies to the Gentiles. They have sinned without the standard and
guidance of positive law; they are, therefore, not brought to the test
of that law’s demands, but to the tests of natural, moral law (which the
apostle will directly describe), and by that test their sins meet their
penalty. Death, as sin’s penalty, is coextensive with *sin,* not with
the Mosaic law. Sin existed before the Mosaic law and apart from it; it
is imputed to the Gentiles—not, indeed in the same way and degree ([Rom.
v. 13](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#013.md)<span
id="vii.vii-p45.4"></span>)—because they have a law of conscience. Each
class is judged by the standard which has been given to them. All the
terms relating to *law* here signify the Mosaic law, which was to Paul
the specific statutory expression of the divine will and the embodiment
of moral principles and duties.—G.B.S.

<span id="vii.vii-p54"></span> αὐτάρκης, writing before the Pelagian
controversy, he does not notice the distinction between a sufficiency of
knowledge, etc., and a supply of grace which must be presupposed. See
Aug. *ad Dardanum*, *Ep*. 188, al. 143, c. 11, 12. See also De C. D. x.
c. 29 and 32. Conc. Araus. <span class="c14"><span

declares grace needed even before the fall, much more after. See Bp.
Bull on the state of man before the fall, Works, II. also Vinc. Lir. c.
24. The question is here whether men had means to attain salvation. It
is taken for granted they had power given them to choose the right, but
whether in the way of nature or of grace it is not defined. The grace
given to Christians was always regarded as so distinct from and superior
to everything granted to Jews or Heathens, that it was difficult to
speak of the manner in which they received Divine assistance. But the
gift spoken of by Justin Martyr, [Ap. i.
13](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#013.md)<span id="vii.vii-p54.2"></span>, is
clearly supernatural. See also, St. Basil, *Const. Mon*. 16, t. 2, p.
559, B. and Macarius, Hom. 56.
