<span id="vi.xl-p1"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vi.xl-p1.1"></span>Homily XL.</span>

<span id="vi.xl-p2"></span>[Acts XVIII.
18](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#018)<span id="vi.xl-p2.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xl-p3"></span>“And Paul after this tarried there yet a good
while, and then took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into
Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in
Cenchrea: for he had a vow.”

<span id="vi.xl-p4"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="vi.xl-p4.1"></span>See</span> how the Law was breaking up; see how
they were bound by conscience. This, namely, was a Jewish custom, to
shear their heads agreeably with a vow. But then there ought to be also
a sacrifice ([Acts 21.26](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#026)<span
id="vi.xl-p4.2"></span>), which was not the case here. <span
id="fr_924"></span>[925](#fn_924) —“Having yet tarried:” after the
beating of Sosthenes. <span id="fr_925"></span>[926](#fn_925) For it was
necessary that he should yet tarry, and comfort them concerning these
things. “He sailed for Syria.” Why does he desire again to come to
Syria? It was there that “the disciples were ordered to be called
Christians” ([Acts 11.26](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#026)<span
id="vi.xl-p6.8"></span>): there, that he had been “commended to the
grace of God” ([Acts 14.26](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#026)<span
id="vi.xl-p6.9"></span>): there, that he had effected such things
concerning the doctrine. “And with him Priscilla”—lo, a woman also <span
id="fr_926"></span>[927](#fn_926) —“and Aquila.” But these he left at
Ephesus. With good reason, namely, that they should teach. For having
been with him so long time, they were learning many things: and yet he
did not at present withdraw them from their custom as Jews. “And he came
to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself entered into the
synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews. When they desired him to tarry
longer time with them, he consented not; but bade them farewell, saying,
I must by all means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem.”
Therefore <span id="fr_927"></span>[928](#fn_927) it was that he was
hindered from coming into Asia, being impelled to what was of pressing
moment. Thus observe him here, entreated (by them) to stay, but because
he could not comply, being in haste to depart, “he bade them farewell.”
However, he did not leave them without more ado, but with promise (to
return): “But I will return again unto you, if God will. And he sailed
from Ephesus.” ([Acts 18.19-21](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#019)<span
id="vi.xl-p8.10"></span>.) “And when he had landed at Cæsarea, and gone
up, and saluted the Church, he went down to Antioch. And after he had
spent some time there, he departed, and went over all the country of
Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples.” ([Acts
18.22-23](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#022)<span
id="vi.xl-p8.11"></span>.) He came again to those places which he had
previously visited. “And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at
Alexandria, an eloquent man, and mighty in the Scriptures, came to
Ephesus.” ([Acts 18.24](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#024)<span
id="vi.xl-p8.12"></span>.) Lo, even learned men are now urgent, and the
disciples henceforth go abroad. Do you mark the spread of the preaching?
“This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in
the Spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord,
knowing only the baptism of John. And he began to speak boldly in the
synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto
them, and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly.” ([Acts
18.25-26](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#025)<span
id="vi.xl-p8.13"></span>.) If this man <span
id="fr_928"></span>[929](#fn_928) knew only the baptism of John, how is
it that he was “fervent in the Spirit,” for the Spirit was not given in
that way? And if those after him needed the baptism of Christ,
much <span id="fr_929"></span>[930](#fn_929) more would he need it. Then
what is to be said? For it is not without a meaning that the writer has
strung the two incidents together. It seems to me that this was one of
the hundred and twenty who were baptized with the Apostles: or, if not
so, then the same that took place in the case of Cornelius, took place
also in the case of this man. But neither does he receive baptism. That
expression, then, “they expounded more perfectly,” seems <span
id="fr_930"></span>[931](#fn_930) to me to be this, that he behooved
also to be baptized. Because the other twelve knew nothing accurate, not
even what related to Jesus. And it is likely <span
id="fr_931"></span>[932](#fn_931) that he did in fact receive baptism.
But if these (disciples) of John, <span
id="fr_932"></span>[933](#fn_932) after that baptism again received
baptism, was this needful for the disciples also? And wherefore the need
of water? These are very different from him, men who did not even know
whether there were a Holy Ghost. <span id="fr_933"></span>[934](#fn_933)
“He was fervent,” then, “in the Spirit, knowing only the baptism of
John:” but these “expounded to him more perfectly. And when he was
disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the
disciples to receive him; who, when he was come, helped them much which
had believed through grace.” ([Acts
18.27](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#027)<span id="vi.xl-p14.2"></span>.)
He wished then also to depart into Achaia, and these <span
id="fr_934"></span>[935](#fn_934) also encouraged (him to do so), having
also given him letters. “Who when he was come, helped them much which
had believed through grace: for he mightily convinced the Jews, and that
publicly, showing by the Scriptures that Jesus was Christ.” ([Acts
18.28](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#028)<span id="vi.xl-p15.7"></span>.)
“And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul, having
passed through the upper coasts”—meaning what we have read as to Cæsarea
and the other places—“came to Ephesus, and having found certain
disciples ([Acts 19.1](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#001)<span
id="vi.xl-p15.8"></span>), “he said to them, Have ye received the Holy
Ghost since ye believed? And they said unto him, We have not so much as
heard whether there be any Holy Ghost. And he said unto them, Unto what
then were ye baptized? And they said, Unto John’s baptism. Then said
Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto
the people, that they should believe on Him who should come after him,
that is, on Christ Jesus.” ([Acts
19.2-4](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#002)<span id="vi.xl-p15.9"></span>.)
For that they did not even believe in Christ is plain from his saying,
“that they should believe on Him that was to come after him.” And he did
not say, The baptism of John is nothing, but, It is incomplete. Nor does
he add this (in so many words), but he taught them, and many received
the Holy Ghost. “When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of
the Lord Jesus. And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy
Ghost came on them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied. And all
the men were about twelve” ([Acts
19.5-7](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#005)<span
id="vi.xl-p15.10"></span>): so that it was likely they had the Spirit,
but it did not appear. <span id="fr_935"></span>[936](#fn_935) “And all
the men were about twelve.”

<span id="vi.xl-p17"></span>(Recapitulation.) “And they came to Ephesus,
and there he left them” ([Acts
18.19](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#019)<span id="vi.xl-p17.1"></span>):
for he did not wish to take them about with him, but left them at
Ephesus. But they subsequently dwelt at Corinth, and he bears high
testimony to them, and writing to the Romans, salutes them. ([Rom. xvi.
3](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#003)<span id="vi.xl-p17.2"></span>.)
Whence it seems to me that they afterwards went back to Rome, in the
time of Nero, <span id="fr_936"></span>[937](#fn_936) as having an
attachment for those parts whence they had been expelled in the time of
Claudius. “But <span id="fr_937"></span>[938](#fn_937) he himself went
into the synagogue.” It seems to me that the faithful still assembled
there, for they did not immediately withdraw them. “And when they
besought him to stay, he consented not” ([Acts
18.20-21](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#020)<span
id="vi.xl-p19.2"></span>), for he was hastening to Cæsarea. “And having
arrived at Cæsarea,” etc., “passing through the region of Galatia and
Phrygia, confirming all the disciples.” ([Acts
18:22](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#022),
[23](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#023)<span id="vi.xl-p19.3"></span>.)
Through these regions also he merely *passes* again, just enough to
establish them by his presence. “And a certain Jew, Apollos by name,”
etc. ([Acts 18.24](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#024)<span
id="vi.xl-p19.4"></span>.) For he was an awakened man, travelling in
foreign parts for this very purpose. Writing of him the Apostle said,
“Now concerning Apollos our brother.” <span
id="fr_938"></span>[939](#fn_938) (<span id="vi.xl-p20.6"></span>[1 Cor.
xvi. 12](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#012)<span
id="vi.xl-p20.7"></span>.) (*<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xl-p20.8"></span>β</span>*<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xl-p20.9"></span>)</span> “Whom when Aquila and Priscilla had
heard,” etc. ([Acts 18.26](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#026)<span
id="vi.xl-p20.10"></span>.) It was not for nothing that he left them at
Ephesus, but for Apollos’ sake, the Spirit so ordered it, that he might
come with greater force to the attack (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xl-p20.11"></span>ἑ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xl-p20.12"></span>πιβἥναι</span>) upon Corinth. What may be the
reason that to him they did nothing, but Paul they assault? They knew
that he was the leader, and great was the name of the man. “And when he
was disposed to pass into Achaia” ([Acts
18.27](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#027)<span id="vi.xl-p20.13"></span>)
i.e. in faith, he did all by faith; “the brethren wrote,” etc. nowhere
envy, nowhere an evil eye. Aquila teaches, or rather this man lets
himself be taught. He was minded to depart, and they send letters. (*a*)
“For he mightily convinced the Jews, and that publicly,” etc. ([Acts
18.28](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#028)<span id="vi.xl-p20.14"></span>.)
Now by this, that he “publicly” convinced them, his boldness was shown:
by the clearness of his arguing, his power was declared: by his
convicting them out of the Scriptures, his skill (of learning). For
neither boldness by itself contributes aught, where there is not power,
nor power where there is not boldness. “He mightily convinced,” it says.
(*<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xl-p20.15"></span>β</span>*) “And it
came to pass,” etc. ([Acts 19.1](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#001)<span
id="vi.xl-p20.16"></span>.) But whence had those, being in Ephesus, the
baptism of John? Probably they had been on a visit at Jerusalem at the
time (of John’s preaching), and did not even know Jesus. And he does not
say to them, Do ye believe in Jesus? but what? “Have ye received the
Holy Ghost?” ([Acts 19.2](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#002)<span
id="vi.xl-p20.17"></span>.) He knew that they had not, but wishes
themselves to say it, that having learnt what they lack, they may ask.
“John verily baptized,” etc. ([Acts
19.4](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#004)<span id="vi.xl-p20.18"></span>.)
From the baptism itself he (John) prophesies: <span
id="fr_939"></span>[940](#fn_939) and he leads them (to see) that this
is the meaning of John’s baptism. (*a*) “That they should believe on Him
that was to come:” on what kind (of Person)? “I indeed baptize you with
water, but He that cometh after me, shall baptize you with the Holy
Ghost.” ([Matt. iii. 11](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#011)<span
id="vi.xl-p21.1"></span>.) “And when Paul,” it says, “had laid his hands
upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spake with tongues, and
prophesied.” ([Acts 19.6](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#006)<span
id="vi.xl-p21.2"></span>.) (*<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xl-p21.3"></span>β</span>*) The gift is twofold: tongues and
prophesyings. Hence is shown an important doctrine, that <span
id="fr_940"></span>[941](#fn_940) the baptism of John is incomplete. And
he does not say, “Baptism” of forgiveness, but, “of repentance.”
What <span id="fr_941"></span>[942](#fn_941) (is it) then? These had not
the Spirit: they were not so fervent, not even instructed. And why did
(Apollos) not receive baptism? <span id="fr_942"></span>[943](#fn_942)
(The case) seems to me to be this: Great was the boldness of the man.
“He taught diligently the things concerning Jesus,” but he needed more
diligent teaching. Thus, though not knowing all, by his zeal he
attracted the Holy Ghost, in the same manner as Cornelius and his
company.

<span id="vi.xl-p25"></span>Perhaps it is the wish of many, Oh that we
had the baptism of John now! But (if we had), many would still be
careless of a life of virtue, and it might be thought that each for
this, and not for the kingdom of heaven’s sake, aimed at virtue. There
would be many false prophets: for then “they which are approved” would
not be very “manifest.” (<span id="vi.xl-p25.1"></span>[1 Cor. xi.
19](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#019)<span id="vi.xl-p25.2"></span>.) As,
“blessed are they that have not seen and yet have believed” ([John
20.29](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#029)<span
id="vi.xl-p25.3"></span>[John 20:0](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#000),
John 29:0<span id="vi.xl-p25.4"></span>), so they that (believe) without
signs. “Except,” saith (Christ), “ye see signs, ye will not believe.”
([John 4.48](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#048)<span
id="vi.xl-p25.5"></span>.) For we lose nothing (by lack of miracles), if
we will but take heed to ourselves. We have the sum and substance of the
good things: through baptism we received remission of sins,
sanctification, participation of the Spirit, adoption, eternal life.
What would ye more? Signs? But they come to an end (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xl-p25.6"></span>ἀ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xl-p25.7"></span>λλὰ καταργεἵται</span>).
Thou hast “faith, hope, charity,” the abiding things: these seek thou,
these are greater than signs. Nothing is equal to charity. For “greater
than all,” saith he, “is charity.” (cf. <span id="vi.xl-p25.8"></span>[1
Cor. xiii. 5](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#005)<span
id="vi.xl-p25.9"></span>.) But now, love is in jeopardy, for only its
name is left behind, while the reality is nowhere (seen), but we are
divided each from the other. What then shall one do to reunite
(ourselves)? For to find fault is easy, but how may one make friendship,
this is the point to be studied; how we may bring together the scattered
members. For be it so, that we have one Church, or one doctrine—yet this
is not the (main) consideration: no, the evil is, that <span
id="fr_943"></span>[944](#fn_943) in these we have not
fellowship—“living peaceably,” as the Apostle says, “with all men”
([Rom. xii. 18](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#018)<span
id="vi.xl-p26.3"></span>), on the contrary, we are at variance one with
another. For be it that we are not having fights every day, yet look not
thou to this, but (to this), that neither have we charity, genuine and
unswerving. There is need of bandages and oil. Let us bear it in mind,
that charity is the cognizance of the disciples of Christ: that without
this, all else avails nothing: that it is an easy task if we will. Yes,
say you, we know all this, but how (to go to work) that it may be
achieved? What (to do), that it may be effected? in what way, that we
may love one another? First, let us put away the things which are
subversive of charity, and then we shall establish this. Let none be
resentful, none be envious, none rejoicing in (others’) misfortunes:
these are the things that hinder love; well then, the things that make
it are of the other sort. For it is not enough to put away the things
that hinder; the things that establish must also be forthcoming. Now
Sirach tells us the things that are subversive (of friendship), and does
not go on to speak of the things which make union. “Reproaching,” he
says, “and revealing of a secret, and a treacherous wound.” (cf.
[Ecclesiasticus 22.27](../../../bib/apo/sir022.htm#027)<span
id="vi.xl-p26.4"></span>.) But in speaking of the men of those times,
these things might well be named, seeing they were carnal: but in our
case, God forbid they should be (even) named. Not <span
id="fr_944"></span>[945](#fn_944) from these things do we bring our
inducements for you, but from the others. For us, there is nothing good
without friendship. Let there be good things without number, but what is
the benefit—be it wealth, be it luxury—without friendship? No possession
equal to this, even in matters of this life, just as there is nothing
worse than men hating (us). “Charity hides a multitude of sins” ([1 Pet.
iv. 8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#008)<span id="vi.xl-p27.3"></span>):
but enmity, even where sins are not, suspects them to be. It is not
enough not to be an enemy; no, one must also love. Bethink thee, that
Christ has bidden, and this is enough. Even affliction makes
friendships, and draws (men) together. “What then,” say you, “now, when
there is no affliction? say, how (are we to act) to become friends?”
Have ye not other friends, I ask? In what way are ye their friends, how
do ye continue such? For a beginning, let none have any enemy: this (in
itself) is not a small matter: let none envy; it is not possible to
accuse the man who envies not. (*b*) How then shall we be warmly
affected? What makes love of persons? Beauty of person. Then let us also
make our souls beautiful, and we shall be amiable one to another: for it
is necessary, of course, not only to love, but also to be loved. Let us
first achieve this point, that we may be loved, and the other will be
easy. How to act that we may be loved? Let us become beautiful, and let
us do this, that we may always have lovers. Let none make it his study
to get money, to get slaves, to get houses, (so much) as to be loved, as
to have a good name. Better is a name than much wealth. For the one
remains, the other perishes: and the one it is possible to acquire, the
other impossible. For he that has got an evil character, will with
difficulty lay it aside: but by means of his (good) name the poor man
may quickly be rich. Let there be a man having ten thousand talents, and
another a hundred friends; the latter is more rich in resources than the
former. Then let us not merely do this, but let us work it as a kind of
trade. “And how can we?” say you. “A sweet mouth multiplieth its
friends, and a gracious tongue.” Let us get a well-spoken mouth, and
pure manners. It is not possible for a man to be such, and not to be
known.

<span id="vi.xl-p28"></span>(*a*) We have one world that we all inhabit,
with the same fruits we all are fed. But these are small matters: by the
same Sacraments we partake of the same spiritual food. These surely are
justifications of loving! (*c*) Mark <span
id="fr_945"></span>[946](#fn_945) how many (inducements and pleas) for
friendship they that are without have excogitated; community of art or
trade, neighborhood, relationships: but mightier than all these are the
impulses and ties which are among us: this Table is calculated more
(than all else) to shame us into friendliness. But many of us who come
thereto do not even know one another. The reason, it may be said, is
that there are so many of them. By no means; it is only our own sluggish
indifference. (Once) there were three thousand ([Acts
2.41](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#041)<span
id="vi.xl-p29.15"></span>)—there were five thousand ([Acts
4.4](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#004)<span
id="vi.xl-p29.16"></span>)—and yet they had all one soul: but now each
knows not his brother, and is not ashamed to lay the blame on the
number, because it is so great! Yet he that has many friends is
invincible against all men: stronger he than any tyrant. Not such the
safety the tyrant has with his body-guards, as this man has with his
friends. Moreover, this man is more glorious than he: for the tyrant is
guarded by his own slaves, but this man by his peers: the tyrant, by men
unwilling and afraid of him; this man by willing men and without fear.
And here too is a wonderful thing to be seen—many in one, and one in
many. (*a*) Just as in an harp, the sounds are diverse, not the harmony,
and they all together give out one harmony and symphony, (*c*) I could
wish to bring you into such a city, were it possible, wherein (all)
should be one soul: then shouldest thou see surpassing all harmony of
harp and flute, the more harmonious symphony. (*b*) But the musician is
the Might of Love: it is this that strikes out the sweet melody, (*d*)
singing, <span id="fr_946"></span>[947](#fn_946) (withal) a strain in
which no note is out of tune. This strain rejoices both Angels, and God
the Lord of Angels; this strain rouses (to hear it) the whole audience
that is in heaven; this even lulls (evil) passions—it does not even
suffer them to be raised, but deep is the stillness. For as in a
theatre, when the band of musicians plays, all listen with a hush, and
there is no noise there; so among friends, while Love strikes the
chords, all the passions are still and laid to sleep, like wild beasts
charmed and unnerved: just as, where hate is, there is all the contrary
to this. But let us say nothing just now about enmity; let us speak of
friendship. Though thou let fall some casual hasty word, there is none
to catch thee up, but all forgive thee; though thou do (some hasty
thing), none puts upon it the worse construction, but all allowance is
made: every one prompt to stretch out the hand to him that is falling,
every one wishing him to stand. A wall it is indeed impregnable, this
friendship; a wall, which not the devil himself, much less men, can
overpower. It is not possible for that man to fall into danger who has
gotten many friends. (Where love is) no room is there to get matter of
anger, but <span id="fr_947"></span>[948](#fn_947) only for pleasantness
of feeling: no room is there to get matter of envying; none, to get
occasion of resentment. Mark him, how in all things both spiritual and
temporal, he accomplishes all with ease. What then, I pray you, can be
equal to this man? Like a city walled on every side is this man, the
other as a city unwalled.—Great wisdom, to be able to be a creator of
friendship! Take away friendship, and thou hast taken away all, thou
hast confounded all. But if the likeness of friendship have so great
power, what must the reality itself be? Then let us, I beseech you, make
to ourselves friends, and let each make this his art. But, lo! you will
say, I do study this, but the other does not. All the greater the reward
to thee. True, say you, but the matter is more difficult. How, I ask?
Lo! I testify and declare to you, that if but ten of you would knit
yourselves together, and make this your work, as the Apostles made the
preaching theirs, and the Prophets theirs the teaching, so we the making
of friends, great would be the reward. Let us make for ourselves royal
portraits. For if this be the common badge of disciples, we do a greater
work than if we should put ourselves into the power to raise the dead.
The diadem and the purple mark the Emperor, and where these are not,
though his apparel be all gold, the Emperor is not yet manifest. So now
thou art making known thy lineage. Make men friends to thyself, and
(friends) to others. There is none who being loved will wish to hate
thee. Let us learn the colors, with what ingredients they are mixed,
with what (tints) this portrait is composed. Let us be affable: let us
not wait for our neighbors to move. Say not, if I see any person hanging
back (for me to make the first advances), I become worse than he: but
rather when thou seest this, forestall him, and extinguish his bad
feeling. Seest thou one diseased, and addest to his malady? This, most
of all, let us make sure of—“in honor to prefer one another, to account
others better than one’s self” (<span id="vi.xl-p31.6"></span>[Rom. xii.
10](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#010)<span id="vi.xl-p31.7"></span>),
deem not this to be a lessening of thyself. If thou prefer (another) in
honor, thou hast honored thyself more, attracting <span
id="fr_948"></span>[949](#fn_948) to thyself a still higher extinction.
On all occasions let us yield the precedence to others. Let us bear
nothing in mind of the evil done to us, but if any good has been done
(let us remember only that). Nothing so makes a man a friend, as a
gracious tongue, a mouth speaking good things, a soul free from
self-elation, a contempt of vain-glory, a despising of honor. If we
secure these things, we shall be able to become invincible to the snares
of the Devil, and having with strictness accomplished the pursuit of
virtue, to attain unto the good things promised to them that love Him,
through the grace and mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ, with Whom to the
Father and the Holy Ghost together be glory, dominion, honor, now and
ever, world without end. Amen.

id="vi.xl-p4.3"></span>

<span id="vi.xl-p5"></span> Two points are much disputed in reference to
the vow mentioned in [Acts 18.18](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#018)<span
id="vi.xl-p5.1"></span>: (1) What kind of a vow it was, whether the
Nazarite vow or some other. (2) Whether it had been taken and whether
the shaving of the head was done by Paul or by Aquila. The majority of
interpreters maintain that this shaving of the head represented the
termination of a Nazarite vow which had been taken by Paul. The view
encounters two great difficulties: (1) How can we suppose that the
champion of liberty from Jewish ceremonies and observances should
himself be given to their observance? (2) Luke here places the name of
the wife Priscilla first and then Aquila, and <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xl-p5.2"></span>κειράμενος</span> stands next to this name. It is
most naturally construed with the name to which it stands nearest,
especially when this unexpected arrangement of the names of the husband
and wife is taken into account. It is true that the same arrangement is
found in the salutation of Paul (<span id="vi.xl-p5.3"></span>[Rom. xvi.
3](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#003)<span id="vi.xl-p5.4"></span>; [1
Tim. iv. 19](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#019)<span
id="vi.xl-p5.5"></span>), but this may be due to the predominant
Christian activity of the wife; so also in [Acts
18.26](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#026)<span id="vi.xl-p5.6"></span>,
which may have been conformed to this passage. The former consideration
is the one of chief importance. On the other side it must be
acknowledged that there would be less motive for mentioning a vow of
Aquila than of Paul. The vow taken was probably akin to that of the
Nazarites. It is referred to Paul by the older interpreters by Bengel,
Olshausen, Zeller, De Wette, Lange, Hackett, Gloag, Lechler, Bleek,
Ewald; to Aquila, by the Vulgate, Grotius, Kuinoel, Wieseler, Meyer,
Conybeare and Howson.—G.B.S.

and explained by the following words.

<span id="vi.xl-p7"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xl-p7.1"></span>᾽</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xl-p7.2"></span>Ιδοὺ καὶ γυνή</span>: transposed from after the
sentence, “For having been—custom as Jews.” Mod. text adds, <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xl-p7.3"></span>τὸ ἴσον ἀνδράσι ποιοῦσα καὶ
διδάσκουσα</span>. But perhaps the comment was, “and mentioned before
her husband.” See *Serm. in illud Salutate Prise. et Aquil.* tom. iii.
p. 176. B. where he comments on this position of the names, and adds
that “she having taken Apollos, an eloquent man, etc. taught him the way
of God and made him a perfect teacher.”

<span id="fn_927"></span>[i:928](1110045.htm#fr_927) <span
id="vi.xl-p7.4"></span>

<span id="vi.xl-p8"></span> Something is wanting here, for in <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xl-p8.1"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xl-p8.2"></span>κωλύετο εἰς τὴν ᾽Ασίαν
ἐλθεῖν</span> there seems to be a reference to [Acts
16.6](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#006)<span id="vi.xl-p8.3"></span>.
<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xl-p8.4"></span>κωλυθέντες λαλῆσαι τὸν
λόγον ἐν τῇ ᾽Ασί& 139·</span>, and again in <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xl-p8.5"></span>οὐ μὴν αὐτοὺς ἁπλῶς εἴασεν</span> to [Acts
16.7](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#007)<span id="vi.xl-p8.6"></span>.
<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xl-p8.7"></span>οὐκ εἴασεν αὐτοὺς τὸ
πνεῦμα</span>. He may have spoken to this effect: This was his first
visit to Ephesus, for he was forbidden before to come into Asia.…Not
however that the Spirit <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xl-p8.8"></span>ἁ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xl-p8.9"></span>πλῶς οὐκ εἴασεν</span>, but he says, with
promise, I will come to you, etc. The prohibition was not absolute, but
he was not permitted on the former occasion to preach in Asia
(Procons.), because he was impelled to more urgent duties (in Macedonia
and Greece); accordingly here also he has other immediate objects in
view, and therefore cannot stay. So in Hom. xli. on xix. 10, 11. “For
this reason also (the Lord) suffered him not to come into Asia, waiting
(or reserving Himself) for this conjuncture.”

<span id="fn_928"></span>[i:929](1110045.htm#fr_928) <span
id="vi.xl-p8.14"></span>

<span id="vi.xl-p9"></span> What St. Chrysostom said has been
misconceived by the reporter or the copyists. He meant to remark two
things concerning Apollos: 1. That having only the baptism of John he
nevertheless had the Spirit, nay, was “fervent in the Spirit.” How so?
He had it, as Cornelius had it; the baptism of the Spirit without the
baptism of water. (See Recapitulation *fin.*) 2. That there is no
mention of his receiving baptism, as the twelve did in the following
narrative. St. Luke, he says, evidently had a meaning in this
juxtaposition of the two incidents. Apollos had the baptism of the
Spirit “therefore did not need the water.” (Hence whether he received it
or not, the writer does not think need to mention it.) Those twelve had
no accurate knowledge even of the facts relating to Jesus: nor so much
as know whether there were a Holy Ghost.—The scribes did not comprehend
this view of the case. Hence A. C. omit <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xl-p9.1"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xl-p9.2"></span>λλ᾽ οὐ βαπτίζεται</span>, retained by B. mod.
text and Cat. Œc. (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xl-p9.3"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xl-p9.4"></span>λλ᾽ οὐδὲ β</span>.)—They take <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xl-p9.5"></span>οἱ μετὰ τοῦτον</span> (i.e.
the twelve of the following incident) to mean the Apostles, and
therefore make it <span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xl-p9.6"></span>πολλῷ
μᾶλλον καὶ οὗτος ἐδεήθη ἂν</span>, “if Christ’s own disciples after
John’s baptism needed the baptism of Christ, *a fortiori* this man would
need it.”—They find the baptism in the <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xl-p9.7"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xl-p9.8"></span>κριβ. αὐτῷ ἐξέθεντο</span>, “this was one of the
points they taught him—that he must be baptized.”—St. Chrys. probably
spoke of the case of the hundred and twenty who were baptized with the
Spirit on the Day of Pentecost: i.e. “Those having” the greater, the
baptism of the Spirit, did not need the less, the baptism of water. The
scribes absurdly make him suggest that Apollos may have been one of the
hundred and twenty.

<span id="fn_929"></span>[i:930](1110045.htm#fr_929) <span
id="vi.xl-p9.9"></span>

<span id="vi.xl-p10"></span> Perhaps it should be, <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xl-p10.1"></span>καὶ εἰ οἱ μετὰ
τοῦτον</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xl-p10.2"></span>…</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xl-p10.3"></span>τοῦ Χ., πῶς οὐχ οὗτος ἐδεήθη ἄν</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xl-p10.4"></span>;</span> <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xl-p10.5"></span>᾽Αλλ᾽ οὐδὲ βαπτίζεται. Τί
οὖν ἐστιν εἰπεῖν</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xl-p10.6"></span>;</span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xl-p10.7"></span>οὐδὲ γὰρ ἁπλῶς ἐφεξῆς ἔθηκεν ἀμφότερα</span>.
(By <span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xl-p10.8"></span>ἀ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xl-p10.9"></span>μφ</span>. perhaps the
scribes understood the “knowing only the baptism of John,” and, the
being “fervent in Spirit”) <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xl-p10.10"></span>᾽</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xl-p10.11"></span>Εμοὶ δοκεῖ ὅπερ ἐπὶ τῶν ἑκατὸν εἴκοσι τῶν μετὰ
τῶν ᾽Απ. βαπτισθέντων, ὅπερ ἐπὶ τοῦ Κορνηλίου γέγονε, γεγένηται καὶ ἐπὶ
τούτου</span>.

<span id="fn_930"></span>[i:931](1110045.htm#fr_930) <span
id="vi.xl-p10.12"></span>

<span id="vi.xl-p11"></span> Here Œcumenius perceived that Chrys. was
misrepresented. Accordingly, he reads, <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xl-p11.1"></span>Τούτου οὖν ἀκριβῶς ἐξετασθέντος</span> (Cat.
<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xl-p11.2"></span>τὸ οὖν ἀκριβῶς
ἐξετασθὲν τὸ</span>, a confusion of the two readings), <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xl-p11.3"></span>δοκεῖ τοῦτο μὴ εἶναι
ὅτι</span>…“This point being closely examined, it does not seem to mean
this, that he also needed to be baptized.” But the scribes took it as
above, and the innovator (with whom A. partly agrees) enlarges it thus:
“But he is not baptized, but when “they expounded to him more
perfectly.” But this seems to me to be true, that he did also need to be
baptized: since the other twelve,” etc. On this the Paris Editor,
supposing the twelve Apostles to be meant, strangely remarks, *Itane?
duodecim quæ Jesum spectabant nihil noverunt Imo* <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xl-p11.4"></span>οἱ κρ'</span>, i.e. <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xl-p11.5"></span>οἱ ἑκατὸν εἴκοσι</span>. As
if it were likely that those hundred and twenty could be so ignorant.

<span id="fn_931"></span>[i:932](1110045.htm#fr_931) <span
id="vi.xl-p11.6"></span>

<span id="vi.xl-p12"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xl-p12.1"></span>Εἰκὸς δε αὐτὸν καὶ βαπτισθῆναι</span>. If Chrys.
said this (see note 7, p. 247), the meaning may be: “It is likely
however that he did receive baptism,” viz. though the writer does not
mention it. For this is the point—the writer mentions it in the case of
those twelve, for it was the means by which they, ignorant hitherto of
the existence of a Holy Ghost, received the Spirit; not so in the case
of Apollos, for as he had already the baptism of the Spirit, the water
was quite a subordinate consideration. See above, Hom, xxiv. p. 157, on
the case of Cornelius.

<span id="fn_932"></span>[i:933](1110045.htm#fr_932) <span
id="vi.xl-p12.2"></span>

<span id="vi.xl-p13"></span> Still overlooking the reference to the
following narrative, B. C. read <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xl-p13.1"></span>Εἰ δὲ αὐτοὶ οἱ ᾽Ιωάννου</span>—, “But if even
John’s disciples,” etc.: mod. text and A., <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xl-p13.2"></span>Πλὴν εἰ καὶ αὐτοί</span>—, reading the next
clause affirmatively, Cat. and Œc., <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xl-p13.3"></span>εἰ δὲ οὗτοι οἱ ᾽Ιωάννου</span>—, which we adopt.
The scribes have further darkened the sense by inserting here [Acts
18:27](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#027), [Acts
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#001)<span id="vi.xl-p13.4"></span>.

<span id="fn_933"></span>[i:934](1110045.htm#fr_933) <span
id="vi.xl-p13.5"></span>

<span id="vi.xl-p14"></span> The utter confusion of the text makes it
uncertain what Chrys. said concerning Apollos. The probability is that
he still stood upon the plane of John’s baptism and teaching, a zealous
and able man, but not yet instructed in the Christian doctrine of the
Spirit, nor understanding the significance of Christian baptism. It is
probable that after receiving instruction he was re-baptized with the
twelve at Ephesus ([Acts 19.5-7](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#005)<span
id="vi.xl-p14.1"></span>).—G.B.S.

<span id="fn_934"></span>[i:935](1110045.htm#fr_934) <span
id="vi.xl-p14.3"></span>

<span id="vi.xl-p15"></span> <span class="Greek"><span

class="Greek"><span id="vi.xl-p15.4"></span>καὶ οὗτος</span> (A. <span

<span id="vi.xl-p16"></span> Viz. the Spirit came upon them in baptism,
but it did not appear until Paul had laid his hands upon them: then they
spake with tongues, etc.

of the sentence where the <span class="c14"><span

<span id="fn_937"></span>[i:938](1110045.htm#fr_937) <span
id="vi.xl-p18.4"></span>

<span id="vi.xl-p19"></span> Instead of this, Edd. have [Acts

<span id="fn_938"></span>[i:939](1110045.htm#fr_938) <span
id="vi.xl-p19.5"></span>

<span id="vi.xl-p20"></span> From this point to the end of the
Exposition, all is confused, viz. in the old text the order is as here
marked by the letters α, <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xl-p20.1"></span>α</span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xl-p20.2"></span>β</span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xl-p20.3"></span>β</span>. . i.e. it gives two expositions,
severally imperfect, but completing each other. In mod. text the parts
are rearranged, but so that the first of the portions marked <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xl-p20.4"></span>β</span> is placed after the
second of those marked <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xl-p20.5"></span>α</span>. It also assigns some of the comments
to wrong texts, and in many places alters the sense.

<span id="fn_939"></span>[i:940](1110045.htm#fr_939) <span
id="vi.xl-p20.19"></span>

<span id="vi.xl-p21"></span> Mod. text “From the baptism itself (i.e.
immediately after it) they prophesy: but this the baptism of John had
not; wherefore it was imperfect. But that they may be made worthy of
such gifts, he more prepared them first.”

<span id="fn_940"></span>[i:941](1110045.htm#fr_940) <span
id="vi.xl-p21.4"></span>

<span id="vi.xl-p22"></span> Mod. text “that they who receive baptism
are (therein) thoroughly cleansed from their sins: for were it not so,
these would not have received the gifts immediately.”

<span id="fn_941"></span>[i:942](1110045.htm#fr_941) <span

<span id="vi.xl-p23"></span> Mod. text “And how is it that they who have
received the Spirit taught not, but Apollos did, who had not yet
received the Spirit?” An entire perversion of Chrysostom’s meaning.

<span id="fn_942"></span>[i:943](1110045.htm#fr_942) <span

<span id="vi.xl-p26"></span> Mod. text besides other alterations: “that

(<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xl-p26.1"></span>ἐ</span><span

id="vi.xl-p27.2"></span>Οὐκ ἀπὸ τ. ὑ. ἀπάγομεν</span>, i.e. “as these
are things not even to be supposed to exist among Christians, we do not
make it our business to lead you away from these;”—and for the other
clause, “But would lead you on to those other things” which Sirach has
not mentioned.

perforce impel us to become and bind us to continue friends,” viz.
independently of our own choice: which is good in point of sense; but
the original reading of the passage implies this meaning: “Even the men
of the world acknowledge the necessity of friendship, and look out
pleas, inducements, and justifications for friendship: <span

with the near and constraining motives which bring and keep us
Christians together. For συντεκνίαν which appears in all our <span

id="vi.xl-p29.17"></span>

<span id="vi.xl-p30"></span> In the old text both sense and syntax are
confused by the transpositions of the parts marked (*c*) and
(*b*)—occasioned perhaps by the *homœteleuton,* viz., <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xl-p30.1"></span>συμφωνίαν</span> at the end
of (*a*) and (*c*): hence (*d*) <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xl-p30.2"></span>οὐδὲν ἀπηχὲς ᾄδουσα μέλος</span> has nothing to
agree with, unless it were the <span class="Greek"><span

<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xl-p30.4"></span>ᾄ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xl-p30.5"></span>δουσα</span>. Mod. text
reforms the whole passage thus: “Just as in an harp, the sounds are
diverse, but one the harmony, and one the musician who touches the harp:
so here, the harp is Charity itself, and the ringing sounds are the
loving words brought forth by Charity, all of them giving out one and
the same harmony and symphony: but the musician is the might of Charity:
this strikes out the sweet strain. I could wish to lead you into such a
city, were it possible, wherein were one soul, and thou shouldest see
how than all harp and flute more harmonious is the symphony there,
singing no dissonant strain,”—Instead of <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xl-p30.6"></span>οὐδὲν ἀπηχὲς ᾄδουσα μέλος</span> <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xl-p30.7"></span>Τοῦτο</span>…, we place the
full stop after <span class="Greek"><span

<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xl-p30.10"></span>Μέλος τοῦτο καὶ

<span id="vi.xl-p31"></span> The omission in B. C. of this clause and
