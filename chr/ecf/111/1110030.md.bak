<span id="vi.xxv-p1"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vi.xxv-p1.1"></span>Homily XXV.</span>

<span id="vi.xxv-p2"></span>[Acts XI.
19](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#019.md)<span id="vi.xxv-p2.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xxv-p3"></span>“Now they which were scattered abroad upon
the persecution that rose about Stephen travelled as far as Phenice, and
Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching the word to none but unto the Jews only.”

<span id="vi.xxv-p4"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="vi.xxv-p4.1"></span>The</span> persecution turned out to be no
slight benefit as “to them that love God all things work together for
good.” (<span id="vi.xxv-p4.2"></span>[Rom. viii.
28](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#028)<span id="vi.xxv-p4.3"></span>..md) If
they had made it their express study how best to establish the Church,
they would have done no other thing than this—they dispersed the
teachers. <span id="fr_594"></span>[595](#fn_594.md) Mark in what quarters
the preaching was extended. “They travelled,” it says, “as far as
Phenice and Cyprus and Antioch; to none however did they preach the word
but to Jews only.” Dost thou mark with what wise purposes of Providence
so much was done in the case of Cornelius? This serves both to justify
Christ, and to impeach the Jews. When Stephen was slain, when Paul was
twice in danger, when the Apostles were scourged, then the Gentiles
received the word, then the Samaritans. Which Paul also declares: “To
you it was necessary that the Word of God should first be spoken; but
since ye thrust it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy, lo, we turn
unto the Gentiles.” ([Acts 13.46](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#046.md)<span
id="vi.xxv-p5.3"></span>.) Accordingly they went about, preaching to
Gentiles also. “But some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who,
when they were come to Antioch, spake unto the Greeks, preaching the
Lord Jesus:” ([Acts 11.20](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#020.md)<span
id="vi.xxv-p5.4"></span>.) for it is likely both that they could now
speak Greek, and that there were such men in Antioch. <span
id="fr_595"></span>[596](#fn_595.md) “And the hand of the Lord,” it says,
“was with them,” that is, they wrought miracles; “and a great number
believed, and turned unto the Lord.” ([Acts
11.21](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#021)<span id="vi.xxv-p6.6"></span>..md)
Do you mark why now also there was heed of miracles (namely) that they
might believe? “Then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the
church which was in Jerusalem: and they sent forth Barnabas, that he
should go as far as Antioch.” ([Acts
11.22](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#022)<span id="vi.xxv-p6.7"></span>..md)
What may be the reason that, when such a city received the word, they
did not come themselves? Because of the Jews. But they send Barnabas.
However, it is no small part of the providential management even so that
Paul comes to be there. It is both natural, and it is wisely ordered,
that they are averse to him, and (so) that Voice of the Gospel, that
Trumpet of heaven, is not shut up in Jerusalem. Do you mark how on all
occasions, Christ turns their ill dispositions to needful account and
for the benefit of the Church? Of their hatred to the man, He availed
Himself for the building up of the Church. But observe this holy
man—Barnabas, I mean—how he looked not to his own interests, but hasted
to Tarsus. “Who, when he came, and had seen the grace of God, was glad,
and exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart, they would cleave
unto the Lord. For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost, and of
faith: and much people was added unto the Lord.” ([Acts
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#023.md),
[24](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#024)<span id="vi.xxv-p6.8"></span>..md) He
was a very kind man, and single-hearted, and considerate (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxv-p6.9"></span>συγγνωμονικός</span>). “Then
departed Barnabas to Tarsus, for to seek Saul.” ([Acts
11.25](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#025)<span id="vi.xxv-p6.10"></span>..md)
He came to the athletic wrestler, the general (fit to lead armies), the
champion of single combat, the lion—I am at a loss for words, say what I
will—the hunting-dog, killer of lions, bull of strength, lamp of
brightness, mouth sufficing for a world. “And when he had found him, he
brought him to Antioch.” ([Acts
11.26](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#026)<span id="vi.xxv-p6.11"></span>..md)
Verily this is the reason why it was there they were appointed to be
called Christians, because Paul there spent so long time! “And it came
to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the Church,
and taught much people. And the disciples were first called Christians
at Antioch.” <span id="fr_596"></span>[597](#fn_596.md) No small matter of
praise to that city! This is enough to make it a match for all, that for
so long a time it had the benefit of that mouth, it first, and before
all others: wherefore also it was there in the first place that men were
accounted worthy of that name. Do you observe the benefit resulting (to
that city) from Paul, to what a height that name, like a standard (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxv-p7.6"></span>σημεἵον</span>), exalted it?
Where three thousand, where five thousand, believed, where so great a
multitude, nothing of the sort took place, but they were called
“they <span id="fr_597"></span>[598](#fn_597.md) of the way:” here they
were called Christians. “And in these days came prophets from Jerusalem
unto Antioch.” ([Acts 11.27](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#027.md)<span
id="vi.xxv-p8.7"></span>.) It was need that the fruit of alms should
also be planted there. And see how of necessity (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxv-p8.8"></span>ἀ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxv-p8.9"></span>ναγκαίως</span>) (it comes
about that) none of the men of note becomes their teacher. They got for
their teachers, men of Cyprus, and Cyrene, and Paul—though he indeed
surpassed (the Apostles) themselves—since Paul also had for teachers
Ananias and Barnabas. But <span id="fr_598"></span>[599](#fn_598.md) here
of necessity (this was the case). “And there stood up one of them named
Agabus, and signified by the spirit that there would be great dearth
throughout the world, which also came to pass in the days of Claudius
Cæsar.” ([Acts 11.28](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#028.md)<span
id="vi.xxv-p9.12"></span>.) “By the Spirit,” it says: for, that they may
not imagine that this was the reason why the famine came, (namely)
because Christianity was come in, because the demons were departed, the
Holy Ghost foretells it: this, however, was nothing wonderful, for in
fact Christ predicted it. Not this was the reason, else this must have
been the case from the beginning: but it was because of the evils done
to the Apostles—and God had borne long with them; but, when they pressed
upon them, a great famine ensues, betokening to the Jews the coming
woes. “If it was because of them, in any wise it ought to have stopped
(there), when it did exist. What harm had the Gentiles done, that they
should have their share in the evils? They ought rather to have been
marked as approved (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxv-p9.13"></span>εὐδοκιμἥσαι</span>), because they were doing
their part, were slaying, punishing, taking vengeance, persecuting on
every side. And mark also at what time the famine comes: precisely when
the Gentiles were thenceforth added to the Church. But if, as you say,
it was because of the evils (done by the Jews), these ought to have been
exempted.” How so? Christ, forestalling this objection, said, “Ye shall
have tribulation.” ([John xvi. 33](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#033.md)<span
id="vi.xxv-p9.14"></span>.) (It is) just as if you should say, They
ought not to have been scourged either. “Then the disciples, every man
according to his ability, determined to send relief unto the brethren
which dwelt in Judea.” ([Acts
11.29](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#029)<span id="vi.xxv-p9.15"></span>..md)
Mark how the famine becomes to them the means of salvation, an occasion
of alms-giving, a harbinger of many blessing. And (so it might have
been) to you, one may say, if you were so minded, but ye would not. But
it is predicted, that they might be prepared beforehand for almsgiving.
“Unto the brethren which dwelt in Judæa;” for they were enduring great
hardships, but before this, they were not suffering from famine. “Which
also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and
Saul.” ([Acts 11.30](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#030.md)<span
id="vi.xxv-p9.16"></span>.) Do you mark them, that no sooner do they
believe than they bring forth fruit, not only for their own but for
those afar off? And Barnabas is sent and Saul, to minister (the same.)
Of this occasion (᾽<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxv-p9.17"></span>Ενταὕθα</span>) he says (to the Galatians),
“And James, Cephas, and John gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of
fellowship, only” (they would) “that we should remember the poor.”
(<span id="vi.xxv-p9.18"></span>[Gal. ii.
9](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#009)<span id="vi.xxv-p9.19"></span>..md)
James was yet living. <span id="fr_599"></span>[600](#fn_599.md)

<span id="vi.xxv-p11"></span>“Now they which were scattered abroad upon
the persecution,” etc. (Recapitulation.) Do you mark how even in the
tribulation instead of falling to lamentations and tears, as we do, they
give themselves up to a great and good work? “Travelled as far as
Phenice, and Cyprus, and Antioch,” and there with more security preached
the word. “And some of them, which were men of Cyprus and Cyrene,” etc.
([Acts 11.20](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#020.md)<span
id="vi.xxv-p11.1"></span>.) And they did not say, “(What), we, Cyrenians
and Cyprians, to attack this splendid and great city!” but trusting in
the grace of God, they applied themselves to the work of teaching, nor
did these (Gentiles) themselves think scorn to learn anything of them.
Mark how by small means all is brought about: mark the preaching how it
spreads: mark those in Jerusalem, having like care for all, holding the
whole world as one house. “They heard that Samaria had received the
word, and” ([Acts 8.14](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#014.md)<span
id="vi.xxv-p11.2"></span>) to Samaria they send the Apostles: they heard
what had befallen at Antioch, and to Antioch they send Barnabas: they
also send again, and (these) prophets. For the distance was great, and
it was not meet the Apostles at present should separate from thence,
that they might not be thought to be fugitives, and to have fled from
their own people. But then, almost precisely, is the time of their
parting from Jerusalem, when the state (of the Jews) was shown to be
past remedy, when the war was close at hand, and they must needs perish:
when the sentence was made absolute. For, until Paul went to Rome, the
Apostles were there (at Jerusalem). But they depart, not because afraid
of the war—how should it be so?—seeing those they went to, were those
that should bring the war: and moreover the war breaks out only after
the Apostles were dead. For of them (the Apostles) says, “The wrath is
come upon them unto the end.” (<span id="vi.xxv-p11.3"></span>[1 Thess.
ii. 16](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#016.md)<span
id="vi.xxv-p11.4"></span>.) The more insignificant the persons, the more
illustrious the grace, working great results by small means.—“And <span
id="fr_600"></span>[601](#fn_600.md) he exhorted them to cleave unto the
Lord, for he was a good man.” ([Acts
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#023.md),
[24](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#024)<span id="vi.xxv-p12.3"></span>..md)
By “good man,” I take it, he means one that is kind, (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxv-p12.4"></span>χρηστὸν</span>) sincere,
exceedingly desirous of the salvation of his neighbors—“for he was a
good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith. To <span
id="fr_601"></span>[602](#fn_601.md) cleave unto the Lord with purpose of
heart” (this is said): with encomium and praise. “And much people was
added unto the Lord:” for like rich land this city received the word,
and brought forth much fruit. “Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus,” etc.
([Acts 11.25](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#025.md)<span
id="vi.xxv-p13.3"></span>.) But why did he take him off from Tarsus and
bring him here? Not without good reason; for here were both good hopes,
and a greater city, and a great body of people. See how grace works all,
not <span id="fr_602"></span>[603](#fn_602.md) Paul: by small means the
affair was taking its commencement. When it is become difficult the
Apostles take it up. Why did they not before this seen Barnabas? Because
they had enough to do (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxv-p14.4"></span>ἠ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxv-p14.5"></span>σχόληντο</span>) with Jerusalem. Again they
justified themselves <span id="fr_603"></span>[604](#fn_603.md) to the
Jews, that the Gentiles were receiving (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxv-p15.2"></span>προσελάμβανε</span>) the word, even without
enjoying so great attention. There is about to be a questioning:
therefore the affair of Cornelius forestalled it. Then indeed they say,
“That we to the Gentiles, and they to the Circumcision.” ([Gal. ii.
9](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#009)<span id="vi.xxv-p15.3"></span>..md)
Observe, henceforth the very stress of the famine introduces the
fellowship on the part of the Gentiles, namely, from the alms. For they
receive the offerings sent from them.

<span id="vi.xxv-p16"></span>“Now <span
id="fr_604"></span>[605](#fn_604.md) they which were scattered abroad,”
etc. ([Acts 11.19](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#019.md)<span
id="vi.xxv-p17.1"></span>) and not as we who pass our time in
lamentations and tears, in our calamities; but with more fearlessness
they passed their time, as having got to a distance from those hindering
them, and as being among men not afraid of the Jews: which also helped.
And they came to Cyprus, where they had the sea between them, and
greater freedom from anxiety: so <span id="fr_605"></span>[606](#fn_605.md)
they made no account of the fear of men, but (still) they gave the
precedence to the regard of the Law: “they spake to Jews only. But there
were in Antioch certain men of Cyprus and Cyrene:” these, of all others,
least cared for the Jews: “who spake unto the Greeks, preaching the Lord
Jesus.” ([Acts 11.20](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#020.md)<span
id="vi.xxv-p18.9"></span>.) Probably it was because of their not knowing
Hebrew, that they called them Greeks. And “when” Barnabas, it says,
“came and had seen the grace of God,”—not the diligence of men—“he
exhorted them to cleave unto the Lord” ([Acts
11.23](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#023.md)<span
id="vi.xxv-p18.10"></span>): and by this he converted more. “And much
people was added unto the Lord.” Why do they not write to Paul, but send
Barnabas? They did not yet know the virtue of the man: but it is
providentially ordered that Barnabas should come. As there was a
multitude, and none to hinder, well might the faith grow, and above all
because they had no trials to undergo. Paul also preaches, and is no
longer compelled to flee. And it is well ordered, that not they speak of
the famine, but the prophets. The men of Antioch also did not take it
amiss that they sent not the Apostles, but were content with their
teachers: so fervent were they all for the word. They did not wait for
the famine to come, but before this they sent: “according as each had
the ability.” And observe, among the Apostles, others are put in charge
with this trust, but here Paul and Barnabas. For this was no small order
(<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxv-p18.11"></span>οἰκονομία</span>)
of Providence. Besides, it was the beginning, and it was not fit they
should be offended.

<span id="vi.xxv-p19"></span>“As each had the ability, they sent.” But
now, none does this, although there is a famine more grievous than that.
For the cases are not alike, for (all) to bear the calamity in common,
and, while all (the rest) abound, for the poorer to be famishing. And
the expression shows that the givers also were poor, for, it says, “as
each of them had the means.” A twofold famine, even as the abundance is
twofold: a severe famine, a famine not of hearing the word of the Lord,
but of being nourished by alms. <span id="fr_606"></span>[607](#fn_606.md)
Then, both the poor in Judea enjoyed the benefit, and so did those in
Antioch who gave their money; yea, these more than those: but now, both
we and the poor are famishing: they being in lack of necessary
sustenance, and we in luxurious living, <span
id="fr_607"></span>[608](#fn_607.md) lacking the mercy of God. But this is
a food, than which nothing can be more necessary. This is not a food,
from which one has to undergo the evils of repletion: not a food, of
which the most part ends in the draught. (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxv-p21.14"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxv-p21.15"></span>φεδρὥνα</span>.) Nothing more beauteous,
nothing more healthful, than a soul nurtured by this food: it is set
high above all disease, all pestilence, all indigestion and distemper:
none shall be able to overcome it, (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxv-p21.16"></span>ἑ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxv-p21.17"></span>λεἵν</span>) but just as, if one’s body were
made of adamant, no iron, nor anything else, would have power to hurt
it, even so when the soul is firmly compact by almsgiving, nothing at
all shall be able to overcome it. For say, what shall spoil this? Shall
poverty? It cannot be, for it is laid up in the royal treasuries. But
shall robber and housebreaker? Nay, those are walls which none shall be
able to break through. But shall the worm? Nay, this treasure is set far
above the reach of this mischief also. But shall envy and the evil eye?
Nay, neither by these can it be overcome. But shall false accusations
and plottings of evil? No, neither shall this be, for safe as in an
asylum is this treasure. But it were a shame should I make it appear as
if the advantages which belong to almsgiving were only these (the
absence of these evils), and not (the presence of) their opposites. For
in truth it is not merely that it is secure from ill-will; it also gets
abundant blessing from those whom it benefits. For as the cruel and
unmerciful not only have for enemies those whom they have injured, but
those also who are not themselves hurt, partake the grief and join in
the accusation: so those that have done great good have not only those
who are benefited, but those also who are not themselves affected, to
speak their praises. Again (that), it is secure from the attacks of the
evil-disposed, and robbers, and housebreakers—what, is this all the
good, or is it this—that besides the not suffering diminution, it grows
also and increases into multitude? What more shameful than
Nebuchadnezzar, what more foul, what more iniquitous? The man was
impious; after tokens and signs without number he refused to come to his
senses (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxv-p21.18"></span>ανενεγκεἵν</span>), but cast the servants of
God into a furnace: and (yet) after these doings, he worshipped. What
then said the Prophet? “Wherefore,” saith he, “O king let my counsel be
acceptable unto thee, ransom (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxv-p21.19"></span>λύτρωσαι</span>) thy sins by alms, and thine
iniquities by mercies to the poor: peradventure there shall be pardon
for thy transgressions.” (<span id="vi.xxv-p21.20"></span>[Dan. iii.
27](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#027)<span id="vi.xxv-p21.21"></span>..md)
In so speaking, he said it not doubting, nay, with entire confidence,
but wishing to put him in greater fear, and to make a stronger necessity
of doing these things. For if he had spoken it as a thing
unquestionable, the king would have been more supine: just as it is with
us, we then most urge some person (whom we wish to persuade), when <span
id="fr_608"></span>[609](#fn_608.md) they say to us, “Exhort such an one,”
and do not add, “he will be sure to hear,” but only, “peradventure he
will hear:” for by leaving it doubtful, the fear is made greater, and
urges him the more. This is the reason why the Prophet did not make the
thing certain to him. What sayest thou? For so great impieties shall
there be pardon? Yes. There is no sin, which alms cannot cleanse, none,
which alms cannot quench: all sin is beneath this: it is a medicine
adapted for every wound. What worse than a publican? The very matter
(<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxv-p22.12"></span>ὑ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxv-p22.13"></span>πόθεσις</span>) (of his
occupation) is altogether one of injustice: and yet Zaccheus washed away
all these (sins). Mark how even Christ shows this, by the care taken to
have a purse, and to bear the contributions put into it. And Paul also
says, “Only that we remember the poor” (<span
id="vi.xxv-p22.14"></span>[Gal. ii.
10](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#010)<span id="vi.xxv-p22.15"></span>.md):
and everywhere the Scripture has much discourse concerning this matter.
“The ransom,” it saith, “of a man’s soul is his own wealth” ([Prov.
13.8](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#008.md)<span
id="vi.xxv-p22.16"></span>[Prov. 13:0](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#000.md),
[Prov. 8:0](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#000.md)<span
id="vi.xxv-p22.17"></span>): and with reason: for, saith (Christ), “if
thou wouldest be perfect, sell what thou hast, and give to the poor, and
come, follow Me.” ([Matt. xix. 21](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#021.md)<span
id="vi.xxv-p22.18"></span>.) This may well be part of perfection. But
alms may be done not only by money, but by acts. For example: one may
kindly stand (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxv-p22.19"></span>προστἥναι</span>) by a person (to succor and
defend him), one may reach to him a helping hand: the service rendered
(<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxv-p22.20"></span>προστασία</span>)
by acts has often done more good even than money. Let us set to work all
the different kinds of almsgiving. Can you do alms by money? Be not
slack. Can you by good offices? Say not, Because I have no money, this
is nothing. This is a very great point: look upon it as if you had given
gold. Can you do it by kind attentions (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxv-p22.21"></span>θεραπείας</span>)? Do this also. For instance,
if you be a physician, (give) your skill: for this also is a great
matter. Can you by counsel? This (service) is much greater than all:
this (alms) is better than all, or it is also more, by how much the gain
it has is greater. For in so doing you put away not starvation, but a
grievous death. ([Acts 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#006.md), [Acts
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#004)<span id="vi.xxv-p22.22"></span>..md)
With such alms the Apostles above measure abounded: therefore it was
that the distribution of money they put into the hands of those after
them, themselves exhibiting the (mercy) shown by words. Or is it, think
you, a small alms, to a lost, castaway soul, a soul in uttermost
jeopardy, possessed by a burning fever (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxv-p22.23"></span>πυρώσεως</span>), to be able to rid it of its
disease? For example, do you see one possessed by love of money? Pity
the man. Is he in danger of suffocation? Quench his fire. “What if he
will not be persuaded?” Do your part, and be not remiss. Have you seen
him in bonds?—for wealth is indeed bonds. ([Matt. xxv.
35](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#035.md)<span id="vi.xxv-p22.24"></span>
ff.) Go to him, visit him, console him, try to release him of his bonds.
If he refuse, he shall bear the blame himself. Have you seen him naked,
and a stranger?—for he is indeed naked, and a stranger to heaven. Bring
him to your own inn, clothe him with the garment of virtue, give him the
city which is in heaven. “What if I myself be naked?” say you. Clothe
also yourself first: if you know that you are naked, assuredly you know
that you need to be clothed; if you know what sort of nakedness this
is. <span id="fr_609"></span>[610](#fn_609.md) What numbers of women now
wear silken apparel but are indeed naked of the garments of virtue! Let
their husbands clothe these women. “But they will not admit those
garments; they choose to have these.” Then do this also first: induce
them to have a longing for those garments: show them that they are
naked: speak to them of judgment to come: answer me, <span
id="fr_610"></span>[611](#fn_610.md) what is the clothing we shall need
there? But if ye will bear with me, I also will show you this nakedness.
He that is naked, when it is cold, shrinks and shudders, and stands
there cowering, and with his arms folded: but in summer heat, not so. If
then I shall prove to you that your rich men, and rich women, the more
they put on, the more naked they are, do not take it amiss. How then, I
ask you, when we raise the subject of hell-fire, and of the torments
there? Do not these shrink and shudder more than those naked ones? Do
they not bitterly groan and condemn themselves? What? when they come to
this or that man, and say to him, Pray for me, do they not speak the
same words as those (naked wretches)?

<span id="vi.xxv-p25"></span>Now indeed, after all that we can say, the
nakedness is not yet apparent: but it will be plain enough there. How,
and in what way? When these silken garments and precious stones shall
have perished, and it shall be only by the garments of virtue and of
vice that all men are shown, when the poor shall be clad with exceeding
glory, but the rich, naked and in disgraceful sort, shall be haled away
to their punishments. What more naked (Edd. “more dainty”) than that
rich man who arrayed himself in purple? What poorer than Lazarus? Then
which of them uttered the words of beggars? which of them was in
abundance? Say, if one should deck his house with abundance of tapestry
hangings, and himself sit naked within, what were the benefit? So it is
in the case of these women. Truly, the house of the soul, the body I
mean, they hang round with plenty of garments: but the mistress of the
house sits naked within. Lend me the eyes of the soul, and I will show
you the soul’s nakedness. For what is the garment of the soul? Virtue,
of course. And what its nakedness? Vice. For just as, if one were to
strip any decent person, that person would be ashamed, and would shrink
and cower out of sight; just so the soul, if we wish to see it, the soul
which has not these garments, blushes for shame. How many women, think
you, at this moment feel ashamed, and would fain sink to the very depth,
as if seeking some sort of curtain, or screen, that they may not hear
these words? But those who have no evil conscience, are exhilarated,
rejoice, find delight, and gayly deck themselves (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxv-p25.1"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxv-p25.2"></span>γκαλλωπίζονται</span>) with
the things said. Hear concerning that blessed Thekla, <span
id="fr_611"></span>[612](#fn_611.md) how, that she might see Paul, she gave
even her gold: and thou wilt not give even a farthing that thou mayest
see Christ: thou admirest what she did, but dost not emulate her.
Hearest thou not that “Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain
mercy?” ([Matt. v. 7](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#007.md)<span
id="vi.xxv-p26.3"></span>.) What is the gain of your costly garments?
how long shall we continue agape for this attire? Let us put on the
glory of Christ: let us array ourselves with that beauty, that both here
we may be praised, and there attain unto the eternal good things, by the
grace and mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ, with Whom, to the Father and
the Holy Ghost together, be glory, dominion, honor, now and ever, world
without end. Amen.

where the preaching of Philip in Samaria is referred to the persecution
at Jerusalem as its occasion. The dispersion of the disciples now
becomes the means of a great extension of the Gospel and the founding of
the first Gentile Church (at Antioch in Syria). This is the third great
movement in the spread of early Christianity. The order is: (1) The
preaching of Philip in Samaria, (2) The conversion of Cornelius and his
company—the first Gentile additions to the church, (3) This mission
which resulted in the founding of the church at Antioch. But at this
time Divine Providence was preparing an agent who was destined soon to
enter upon his great life work as the Christian missionary to the
Gentile world, to prove the chief means of spreading the gospel
throughout the Roman world—this was the former persecutor Saul, now
transformed into the great apostle to the Gentiles. The conversion of
Cornelius must have occurred about eight years after the ascension of
Jesus. During this time the church had continued Jewish. But in this
very period the conditions were preparing for the extension of
Christianity to the Gentile world. Stephen had caught glimpses of the
largeness of God’s truth and purposes. Peter had learned that God is no
respecter of persons. The mother church at Jerusalem now finds that
God’s grace has outrun all their former conception of its scope;
consecrated and able men like Barnabas and Paul are rising up to labor
in the line of the more comprehensive conception of Christianity’s
method and purpose which is now dawning upon the consciousness of the
church.—G.B.S.

<span id="vi.xxv-p6"></span> While the textual evidence for the reading
<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxv-p6.1"></span>῾Ελληνιστάς</span>
([Acts 11.20](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#020.md)<span
id="vi.xxv-p6.2"></span>.) predominates over that for the reading <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxv-p6.3"></span>῞</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxv-p6.4"></span>Ελληνας</span> (A. C.), yet
the latter is the reading adopted by Meyer, Tischendorf, and most
critics (not so, W. and H.) on grounds of internal evidence, such as:
(1) That they should preach to Hellenists—men of Jewish nationality
residing out of Judea—would be nothing noteworthy, since they had long
been received into the Christian community. (2) The contrast between
[Acts 11:19](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#019.md),
[20](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#020.md)<span id="vi.xxv-p6.5"></span>
would be greatly weakened, if not lost, on the supposition that
Hellenistic Jews were meant. If this view is correct, they now preached
to the Greeks, the uncircumcised heathen, and the Antioch Church was
founded and its reception into Christian fellowship approved by the
mother church at Jerusalem. Antioch now became an important centre of
Christian work, second only to Jerusalem. Here Paul labored a year, and
from Antioch he went forth to his three great missionary
journeys.—G.B.S.

<span id="vi.xxv-p7"></span> The name Christians was probably given by
the Gentiles. The word appears but twice, besides here, in the N.T.
(<span id="vi.xxv-p7.1"></span>[Acts xxvi.
8](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#008.md)<span id="vi.xxv-p7.2"></span>; [1
Pet. iv. 16](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#016.md)<span
id="vi.xxv-p7.3"></span>), and in both cases it is implied that the name
was a name applied to the disciples of Jesus by others. The Jews could
hardly have originated the name since Christ was to them but the Greek
equivalent for their sacred name Messiah, and from that word they would
not have formed a name for the hated sect. The Jews called them rather
Nazarenes (<span id="vi.xxv-p7.4"></span>[Acts xxiv.
5](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#005)<span id="vi.xxv-p7.5"></span>.md). The
Romans seem to have misunderstood the origin of the name, as Tacitus
says: *Auctor nominis ejus (Christiani) Christus,* as if *Christus* was
an appellative instead of a title.—G.B.S.

the <span class="c14"><span id="vi.xxv-p9.4"></span>mss.</span> part of
the text v. 28. being transposed, it reads “But here of necessity he
says there will be a great dearth,” etc.—Below, <span

the old text in <span class="c14"><span
id="vi.xxv-p9.8"></span>mss.</span> and Cat. The meaning is obscure, but
on the whole it seems most probable that all this is an interlocution of
an objector. “If as you say, it was because of the Jews, assuredly it
ought, even when it was there, to have ceased (and not gone on to the
rest of the world). What harm had the Gentiles done, that they should
share in the punishment? Why, they ought rather to have been
distinguished by special marks of the Divine favor, because they were
doing their part (in executing God’s judgments upon the Jews), were
slaying, punishing. etc. Observe, too, the time when this visitation
first came—precisely when the Gentiles were added to the Church. Whereas
if, as you say, it was because of the evils the Jews inflicted upon the
believers, these (the believers, Jews and Gentiles) ought to have been
exempted,” etc. The modern text has: “But even if (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxv-p9.9"></span>ἀ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxv-p9.10"></span>λλ᾽ εἰ καὶ</span>) it were
because of them, yet because of the rest (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxv-p9.11"></span>διὰ τοὺς ἄλλους</span>) it ought, even when it
was, to have ceased. For what harm had the Gentiles done, that even
they, having done no harm, should have their share of the evils? But if
not because of the Jews verily they ought rather to have been even
marked objects of favor,” etc. Perhaps this was intended to mean:
“Suppose it was inflicted by the demons, the Gods of the heathen,
because of the Christians, why were the Gentiles included? And as for
the Jews, if it was not, as I say, sent by God because of their
wickedness, but as the heathen say, was a token of the anger of their
Gods because of the new religion, why assuredly the Jews ought to have
been marked objects of favor because they were doing all they could to
exterminate the faith.” But if so, it does not appear how the next
sentence, was understood, “And observe at what time,” etc.

id="vi.xxv-p10.2"></span>Ε</span><span class="Greek"><span

<span class="c14"><span id="vi.xxv-p10.4"></span>mss.</span>—Ben. finds
it strange that this clause is added in some <span class="c14"><span
id="vi.xxv-p10.5"></span>mss.</span> “For what is it to the matter in
hand, that James was yet living? And which James? For James the brother
of John is mentioned presently afterwards, as slain with the sword: and
James the brother of the Lord, Bishop of Jerusalem, is repeatedly
mentioned as living, in the subsequent history. Then for what purpose
should it be noticed here that he was alive? And yet why the copyists
should add this clause, is not easy to see.” The copyists are not in
fault. St. Chrys. (not fully reported) is identifying this visit to
Jerusalem with the visit mentioned in [Gal.
ii](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#000.md)<span id="vi.xxv-p10.6"></span>. The
mention there made ([Gal. 2.9](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#009.md)<span
id="vi.xxv-p10.7"></span>) of James, whom at the moment he takes to be
James the brother of John (especially as he is named with Cephas and
John), leads him to remark, “James was yet alive:” i.e. when Paul and
Barnabas went up with the alms, and when this conference ensued. ([Acts
xi](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#000)<span id="vi.xxv-p10.8"></span>..md) A
similar inadvertency with respect to St. Philip has been noted above, p.
115, note 1—E. substitutes <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxv-p10.9"></span>τοσοῦτον ὠφέλει ὁ λιμός</span>. and connects
the following sentence with this by reading <span class="Greek"><span

the <span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxv-p10.14"></span>θλῖψις</span>
here spoken of was the famine: which however had not yet begun. Hence
Ben. *Et vide illos ex fame,* etc. In like manner the innovator has
mistaken the connection below. See note 1, p. 165. In fact, the
Recapitulation begins here.

<span id="fn_600"></span>[i:601](1110030.htm#fr_600.md) <span

<span id="vi.xxv-p12"></span> Here Edd. from E. insert the formula of

<span id="vi.xxv-p13"></span> Edd, from E.: “Wherefore also with purpose
of heart he exhorted all: that is, with encomium and praise:” as if
<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxv-p13.1"></span>τῆ προθέσει τῆς
καρδίας</span> belonged to <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxv-p13.2"></span>παρεκάλει</span>, in the sense, “with heartfelt
earnestness he exhorted.”

<span id="fn_602"></span>[i:603](1110030.htm#fr_602.md) <span

E., “not Paul: and how by the small means, the affair took its
beginning, but when it became conspicuous, then they sent Barnabas. And
why did they not send him before this? They took much forethought for
their own people, and did not wish the Jews to accuse them because they
received the Gentiles: and yet because of their inevitably mixing with
them, since there was some questioning about to arise, the matters
relating to Cornelius forestalled (this). Then indeed they say,” etc.

<span id="fn_603"></span>[i:604](1110030.htm#fr_603.md) <span
id="vi.xxv-p14.6"></span>

<span id="vi.xxv-p15"></span> The meaning seems to be, that they let the
preaching to the Gentiles take its course at first; and were enabled to
say to the Jews, “See, the Gentiles receive the word without
encouragement from us: <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxv-p15.1"></span>καὶ οὐ τοσαύτης ἀπολαύοντα ἐπιμελείας</span>.”

<span id="fn_604"></span>[i:605](1110030.htm#fr_604.md) <span
id="vi.xxv-p16.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xxv-p17"></span> The matter contained in this second
recapitulation looks as if it were derived from a different, and in part
fuller, report. The innovator as above (note 1, p. 164) connects it with
the preceding: “they receive the offerings sent from them; who also, not
as we,” etc.

<span id="fn_605"></span>[i:606](1110030.htm#fr_605.md) <span

<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxv-p18.3"></span>προσετίμουν</span>.
The passage is corrupt, but the sense is sufficiently plain, and is thus
expressed by E. Edd. “Which thing itself helped not a little. But they
came also to Cyprus, where was great fearlessness (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxv-p18.4"></span>ἀ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxv-p18.5"></span>δεὲς</span>), and greater
freedom from anxiety. ‘But to none,’ it says, ‘did they speak the word
save to Jews only.’ Not because of the fear of men, of which they made
no account, did they this thing:” but keeping the law, and still bearing
them, <span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxv-p18.6"></span>καὶ αὐτοὺς ἔτι
διαβαστάζοντες</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxv-p18.7"></span>.”</span>—Below, v. 23, Edd. from E, “Perhaps
by praising the multitude and receiving them, by this he converted more:
