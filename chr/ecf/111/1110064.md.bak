<span id="vii.iii-p1"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vii.iii-p1.1"></span>Homily I.</span>

<span id="vii.iii-p2"></span>[Rom.
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#001.md),
[2](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#002.md)<span id="vii.iii-p2.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iii-p3"></span>“Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to
be an Apostle, separated unto the Gospel of God, (which He promised
afore by His prophets in the Holy Scriptures.)”

<span id="vii.iii-p4"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="vii.iii-p4.1"></span>Moses</span> having written five books, has
nowhere put his own name to them, neither have they who after him put
together the history of events after him, no nor yet has Matthew, nor
John, nor Mark, nor Luke; but the blessed Paul everywhere in his
Epistles sets <span id="fr_1188"></span>[1189](#fn_1188.md) his own name.
Now why was this? Because they were writing to people, who were present,
and it had been superfluous to show themselves when they were present.
But this man sent his writings from afar and in the form of a letter,
for which cause also the addition of the name was necessary. But if in
the Epistle to the Hebrews he does not do the same, this too is after
his own wise judgment. <span id="fr_1189"></span>[1190](#fn_1189.md) For
since they felt prejudiced against him, lest on hearing the name at the
outstart, they should stop up all admission to his discourse, he subtly
won their attention by concealing the name. But if some Prophets and
Solomon have put their names, this I leave as a subject for you to look
further into hereafter, why some of them wished to put it so, and some
not. For you are not to learn everything from me, but to take pains
yourselves also and enquire further, lest ye become more dull-witted.

<span id="vii.iii-p7"></span>“Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ.” Why did
God change his name, and call him Paul who was Saul? It was, that he
might not even in this respect come short of the Apostles, but that that
preëminence which the chief of the Disciples had, he might also acquire
([Mark iii. 16](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#016.md)<span
id="vii.iii-p7.1"></span>); and have whereon to ground a closer union
with them. And he calls himself, the servant of Christ, yet not merely
this; <span id="fr_1190"></span>[1191](#fn_1190.md) for there be many sorts
of servitude. One owing to the Creation, according to which it says,
“for all are Thy servants” (<span id="vii.iii-p8.1"></span>[Ps. cxix.
91](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#091)<span id="vii.iii-p8.2"></span>.md);
and according to which it says, “Nebuchadnezzar, My servant” (<span
id="vii.iii-p8.3"></span>[Jer. xxv.
9](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#009)<span id="vii.iii-p8.4"></span>.md), for
the work is the servant of Him which made it. Another kind is that from
the faith, of which it saith, “But God be thanked that ye were the
servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from a pure heart that form of
doctrine which was delivered unto you: being then made free from sin, ye
became the servants of righteousness.” (<span
id="vii.iii-p8.5"></span>[Rom. 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#017.md),
[18](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#018)<span id="vii.iii-p8.6"></span>..md)
Another is that from civil subjection (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.iii-p8.7"></span>πολιτείας</span>), after which it saith, “Moses
my servant is dead” (<span id="vii.iii-p8.8"></span>[Jos. i.
2](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#002)<span id="vii.iii-p8.9"></span>.md); and
indeed all the Jews were servants, but Moses in a special way as shining
most brightly in the community. Since then, in all the forms of the
marvellous servitude, Paul was a servant, this he puts in the room of
the greatest title of dignity, saying, “a servant of Jesus Christ.” And
the Names appertaining to the dispensation <span
id="fr_1191"></span>[1192](#fn_1191.md) he sets forth, going on upwards
from the lowest. For with the Name Jesus, did the Angel come from Heaven
when He was conceived of the Virgin, and Christ He is called from being
anointed, which also itself belonged to the flesh. And with what oil, it
may be asked, was He anointed? It was not with oil that He was anointed,
but with the Spirit. And Scripture has instances of calling such
“Christs”: inasmuch as the Spirit is the chief point in the unction, and
that for which the oil is used. And where does it call those “Christs”
who are not anointed with oil? “Touch not,” it says, “Mine anointed, and
do My prophets no harm” (<span id="vii.iii-p9.2"></span>[Ps. cv.
15](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#015)<span id="vii.iii-p9.3"></span>.md),
but at that time the institution of anointing with oil did not yet even
exist.

<span id="vii.iii-p10"></span>“Called an Apostle.” He styles himself
“called” in all his Epistles, so showing his own candor (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.iii-p10.1"></span>εὐγνωμοσύνην</span>), and
that it was not of his own seeking that he found, but that when called
he came near and obeyed. And the faithful, he styles, “called to be
saints,” <span id="fr_1192"></span>[1193](#fn_1192.md) but while they had
been called so far as to be believers, he had besides a different thing
committed to his hands, namely, the Apostleship, a thing full of
countless blessings, and at once greater than and comprehensive of, all
the gifts.

<span id="vii.iii-p12"></span>And what more need one say of it, than
that whatsoever Christ was doing when present, this he committed to
their hands when He departed. Which also Paul cries aloud, speaking
thereof and magnifying the dignity of the Apostles’ office; “We are
ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech by us;” i.e. in
Christ’s stead. “Separated to the Gospel of God.” ([2 Cor. v.
20](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#020)<span id="vii.iii-p12.1"></span>..md)
For as in a house, each one is set apart for divers works; thus also in
the Church, there be divers distributions of ministrations. And herein
he seems to me to hint, that he was not appointed by lot only, but that
of old and from the first he was ordained to this office; which also
Jeremy saith, that God spake concerning himself, “Before thou camest
forth out of the womb, I sanctified thee, I ordained thee a prophet unto
the nations.” (<span id="vii.iii-p12.2"></span>[Jer. i.
5](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#005)<span id="vii.iii-p12.3"></span>..md)
For in that he was writing to a vainglorious city, and one every way
puffed up, he therefore uses every mode of showing that his election was
of God. For he Himself called him, and Himself separated him. And he
does this, that he may make the Epistle deserve credit, and meet an easy
reception. “To the Gospel of God.” Not Matthew then alone is an
Evangelist, nor Mark, as neither was this man alone an Apostle, but they
also; even if he be said prëeminently to be this, and they that. And he
calleth it the Gospel, not for those good things only which have been
brought to pass, but also for those which are to come. And how comes he
to say, that the Gospel “of God” is preached by himself? for he says,
“separated to the Gospel of God”—for the Father was manifest, even
before the Gospels. Yet even if He were manifest, it was to the Jews
only, and not even to all of these as were fitting. For neither did they
know Him to be a Father, and many things did they conceive unworthily of
Him. Wherefore also Christ saith, “The true worshippers” shall come, and
that “the Father seeketh such to worship Him.” (<span
id="vii.iii-p12.4"></span>[John iv.
23](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#023)<span id="vii.iii-p12.5"></span>..md)
But it was afterwards that He Himself with the Son was unveiled to the
whole world, which Christ also spake of beforehand, and said, “that they
might know Thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ Whom Thou has sent.”
([John xvii. 3](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#003.md)<span
id="vii.iii-p12.6"></span>.) But he calls it the “Gospel” of God, to
cheer the hearer at the outstart. For he came not with tidings to make
the countenance sad, as did the prophets with their accusations, and
charges, and reproofs, but with glad tidings, even the “Gospel of God;”
countless treasures of abiding and unchangeable blessings.

<span id="vii.iii-p13"></span>[Rom.
1.2](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#002.md)<span id="vii.iii-p13.1"></span>.
“Which He promised afore by His Prophets in the Holy Scriptures.”

<span id="vii.iii-p14"></span>For the Lord, saith he, “shall give the
word to them that proclaim glad tidings with great power” (<span
id="vii.iii-p14.1"></span>[Ps. lxviii.
12](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#012.md)<span id="vii.iii-p14.2"></span>,
Sept.); and again, “How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the
Gospel of peace.” (<span id="vii.iii-p14.3"></span>[Is. lii.
7](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#007.md)<span id="vii.iii-p14.4"></span>;
[Rom. x. 15](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#015.md)<span
id="vii.iii-p14.5"></span>.) See here both the name of the Gospel
expressly and the temper of it, laid down in the Old Testament. For, we
do not proclaim it by words only, he means, but also by acts done; since
neither was it human, but both divine and unspeakable, and transcending
all nature. Now since they have laid against it the charge of novelty
also, He shows it to be older than the Greeks, and described aforetime
in the Prophets. And if He gave it not from the beginning because of
those that were unwilling to receive it, still, they that were willing
did hear it. “Your father Abraham,” He says, “rejoiced to see My day,
and he saw it, and was glad.” ([John viii.
56](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#056)<span id="vii.iii-p14.6"></span>..md)
How then comes He to say, “Many prophets desired to see the things which
ye see, and have not seen them?” ([Matt. xiii.
17](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#017)<span id="vii.iii-p14.7"></span>..md)
He means not so, as ye see and hear, the Flesh itself, and the very
miracles before your eyes. But let me beg you to look and see what a
very long time ago these things were foretold. For when God is about to
do openly some great things, He announces them of a long time before, to
practise men’s hearing for the reception of them when they come.

<span id="vii.iii-p15"></span>“In the Holy Scriptures.” Because the
Prophets not only spake, but also writ what they spake; nor did they
write only, but also shadowed them forth by actions, as Abraham when he
led up Isaac, and Moses when he lifted up the Serpent, and when he
spread out his hands <span id="fr_1193"></span>[1194](#fn_1193.md) against
Amalek, and when he offered the Paschal Lamb.

<span id="vii.iii-p17"></span>[Rom.
1.3](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#003.md)<span id="vii.iii-p17.1"></span>.
“Concerning His Son which was made of the seed of David, according to
the flesh.”

<span id="vii.iii-p18"></span>What dost, thou, O Paul, that after
lifting up our souls so, and elevating them, and causing great and
unutterable things to pass in show before them, and speaking of the
Gospel, and that too the Gospel of God, and bringing in the chorus of
the Prophets, and showing the whole of them heralding forth many years
before those things which were to come: why dost thou again bring us
down to David? Art thou conversing, oh tell me, of some man, and giving
him Jesse’s son for a father? And wherein are these things worthy of
what thou hast just spoken of? Yea, they are fully worthy. For our
discourse is not, saith he, of any bare man. Such was my reason for
adding, “according to the flesh;” as hinting that there is also a
Generation of the Same after the Spirit. And why did he begin from that
and not from this the higher? It is because that was what Matthew, and
Luke, and Mark, began from. For he who would lead men by the hand to
Heaven, must needs lead them upwards from below. So too was the actual
dispensation ordered. First, that is, they saw Him a man upon earth, and
then they understood Him to be God. In the same direction then, as He
Himself had framed His teaching, did His disciple also shape out the way
which leadeth thither. Therefore the generation according to the flesh
is in his language placed first in order, not because it was first, but
because he was for leading the hearer from this up to that.

<span id="vii.iii-p19"></span>[Rom.
1.4](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#004.md)<span id="vii.iii-p19.1"></span>.
“And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the Spirit
of Holiness, by the resurrection from the dead, even Jesus Christ.”

<span id="vii.iii-p20"></span>What is said has been made obscure by the
close-folding of the words, and so it is necessary to divide it. What
then is it, which he says? We preach, says he, Him Who was made of
David. But this is plain. Whence then is it plain, that this incarnate
“Person” was also the Son of God? First, it is so from the prophets;
wherefore he says, “Which He had promised afore by the Prophets in the
Holy Scriptures.” ([Rom. 1.2](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#002.md)<span
id="vii.iii-p20.1"></span>.) And this way of demonstration is no weak
one. And next also from the very way of His Generation: which also he
sets forth by saying, “of the seed of David according to the flesh:” for
He broke the rule of nature. Thirdly, from the miracles which He did,
yielding a demonstration of much power, for “in power” means this.
Fourthly, from the Spirit which He gave to them that believe upon Him,
and through which He made them all holy, wherefore he saith, “according
to the Spirit of holiness.” For it was of God only to grant such gifts.
Fifthly, from the Resurrection; for He first and He alone raised
Himself: and this Himself too said to be above all a miracle sufficient
to stop the mouths even of them that behaved shamelessly. For, “Destroy
this Temple,” He says, “and in three days I will raise it up” ([John
2.19](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#019.md)<span
id="vii.iii-p20.2"></span>.); and, “When ye have lifted” Me “up from the
earth, then shall ye know that I am He” ([John
8.28](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#028)<span id="vii.iii-p20.3"></span>.md);
and again, This “generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no
sign be given unto it, but the sign of Jonas.” ([Matt. xii.
39](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#039)<span id="vii.iii-p20.4"></span>..md)
What then is the being “declared?” being shown, being manifested, being
judged, being confessed, by the feeling and suffrage of all; by
Prophets, by the marvelous Birth after the Flesh, by the power which was
in the miracles, by the Spirit, through which He gave sanctification, by
the Resurrection, whereby He put an end to the tyranny of death.

<span id="vii.iii-p21"></span>[Rom.
1.5](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#005.md)<span id="vii.iii-p21.1"></span>.
“By Whom we have received grace and Apostleship for obedience to the
faith.”

<span id="vii.iii-p22"></span>See the candor of the servant. He wishes
nothing to be his own, but all his Master’s. And indeed it was the
Spirit that gave this. Wherefore He saith, “I have many things to say
unto you, but ye cannot bear them now. Howbeit when He, the Spirit of
Truth, is come, He will guide you into all truth” (<span
id="vii.iii-p22.1"></span>[John xvi.
12](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#012)<span id="vii.iii-p22.2"></span>.md):
and again, “Separate Me Paul and Barnabas.” ([Acts xiii.
2](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#002)<span id="vii.iii-p22.3"></span>..md)
And in the Epistle to the Corinthians, he says, that “to one is given by
the Spirit the word of wisdom, to another the word of knowledge” (<span
id="vii.iii-p22.4"></span>[1 Cor.
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#008.md),
[11](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#011)<span id="vii.iii-p22.5"></span>.md);
and that It divideth all as It willeth. And in addressing the Milesians,
he says, “Over which the Holy Ghost hath made you shepherds and
overseers.” ([Acts xx. 28](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#028.md)<span
id="vii.iii-p22.6"></span>.) You see, he calls the things of the Spirit,
the Son’s, and the things of the Son, the Spirit’s. “Grace and
Apostleship;” that is, it is not we that have achieved for ourselves,
that we should become Apostles. For it was not by having toiled much and
labored that we had this dignity allotted to us, but we received grace,
and the successful result is a part of the heavenly gift. “For obedience
to the faith.” So it was not the Apostles that achieved it, but grace
that paved the way before them. For it was their part to go about and
preach, but to persuade was of God, Who wrought in them. As also Luke
saith, that “He opened their heart” ([Acts xvi.
14](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#014)<span id="vii.iii-p22.7"></span>.md);
and again, To whom it was given to hear the word of God. <span
id="fr_1194"></span>[1195](#fn_1194.md) “To obedience;” he says not, to
questioning and parade (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.iii-p23.4"></span>κατασκευὴν</span>) of argument but “to
obedience.” For we were not sent, he means, to argue, but to give those
things which we had trusted to our hands. For when the Master declareth
aught, they that hear should not be nice and curious handlers of what is
told them, but receivers only; for this is why the Apostles were sent,
to speak what they had heard, not to add aught from their own stock, and
that we for our part should believe—that we should believe
what?—“concerning His Name.” Not that we should be curious about the
essence, but that we should believe on the Name; for this it was which
also wrought the miracles. For it says, “in the Name of Jesus Christ
rise up and walk.” ([Acts iii. 6](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#006.md)<span
id="vii.iii-p23.5"></span>.) And this too requireth faith, neither can
one grasp aught of these things by reasoning (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.iii-p23.6"></span>λογισμᾥ καταλαβεἵν</span>). “Among all
nations, among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ.” What? did
Paul preach then to all the nations? Now that he ran through the whole
space from Jerusalem to Illyricum, and from thence again went forth to
the very ends of the earth, is plain from what he writes to the Romans;
but even if he did not come to all, yet still what he says is not false,
for he speaks not of himself alone, but of the twelve Apostles, and all
who declared the word after them. And in another sense, one should not
see any fault to find with the phrase, if about himself, when one
considers his ready mind, and how that after death he ceaseth not to
preach in all parts of the world. And consider how he extols the gift,
and shows that it is great and much more lofty than the former, since
the old things were with one nation, but this gift drew sea and land to
itself. And attend to this too, how free the mind of Paul is from all
flattery; for when conversing with the Romans, who were seated as it
were upon a sort of summit of the whole world, he attaches no more to
them than to the other nations, nor does he on the score of their being
then in power and ruling, say, that they have in spiritual things also
any advantage. But as (he means) we preach to all the nations, so do we
to you, numbering them with Scythians and Thracians: for if he did not
wish to show this, it were superfluous to say “Among whom are ye
also.” <span id="fr_1195"></span>[1196](#fn_1195.md) And this he does to
take down their high spirit (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.iii-p24.4"></span>κενὥν τὸ φύσημα</span>) and to prostrate the
swelling vanity of their minds, and to teach them to honor others alike
to themselves: and so he proceeds to speak upon this very point.

<span id="vii.iii-p25"></span>[Rom.
1.6](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#006.md)<span id="vii.iii-p25.1"></span>.
“Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ.”

<span id="vii.iii-p26"></span>That is, along with whom ye also are: and
he does not say, that he called the others with you, but you with the
others. For if in Christ Jesus there is neither bond nor free, much less
is there king and private man. For even ye were called and did not come
over of yourselves.

<span id="vii.iii-p27"></span>[Rom.
1.7](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#007.md)<span id="vii.iii-p27.1"></span>.
“To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints: grace to
you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.”

<span id="vii.iii-p28"></span>See how continually he puts the word
“called,” saying, “called to be an Apostle; among whom ye also are
called; to all that be in Rome, called:” and this he does not out of
superfluity of words, but out of a wish to remind them of the benefit.
For since among them which believed, it was likely that there would be
some of the consuls (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.iii-p28.1"></span>ὑ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.iii-p28.2"></span>πάτων</span>; Ben. *consulares*) and rulers as
well as poor and common men, casting aside the inequality of ranks, he
writes to them all under one appellation. But if in things which are
more needful and which are spiritual, all things are set forth as common
both to slaves and to free, for instance, the love from God, the
calling, the Gospel, the adoption, the grace, the peace, the
sanctification, all things else, how could it be other than the
uttermost folly, whom God had joined together, and made to be of equal
honor in the greater things, those to divide on account of things on
earth? on this ground, I presume, from the very outstart, this blessed
Apostle, after casting out this mischievous disease, conducts them to
the mother of blessings, humble-mindedness. This made servants better,
since they learnt that they should take no harm from their servitude,
while they had the true freedom; this would incline masters to be
gentle, as being instructed that they have no advantage in being free,
unless the goods of faith have the first place given them. And that you
may learn that he was not doing this to work confusion, by dashing all
things, but still knew the best distinction, he wrote not simply to all
that were in Rome, but with a definition added, “beloved of God.” For
this is the best discrimination, and shows whence the sanctification
was. Whence then was the sanctification? from Love. For after saying,
“beloved,” then he proceeds, “called to be saints,” showing that it is
from this that the fount of all blessings is. But saints he calls all
the faithful. “Grace unto you and peace.”

<span id="vii.iii-p29"></span>Oh address, that bringeth countless
blessings to us! This also Christ bade the Apostles to use as their
first word when entering into houses. ([Luke x.
5](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#005)<span id="vii.iii-p29.1"></span>..md)
Wherefore it is from this that Paul also in all places takes his
beginning, from grace and peace; for it was no small war which Christ
put an end to, but indeed one varying and of every kind and of a long
season (<span class="Greek"><span id="vii.iii-p29.2"></span>τοικίλον καὶ
ταντοδαπὸν</span>); and this not from our labors, but through His grace.
Since then love presented us with grace, and grace with peace, having
set them down in the due order of an address, he prays over them that
they may abide perpetual and unmoved, so that no other war may again be
blown into flame, and beseeches Him that gave, to keep these things
firmly settled, saying as follows, “Grace be unto you and peace from God
our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.” See in this passage, the “from”
is common to the Son and the Father, and this is equivalent to “of
whom.” <span id="fr_1196"></span>[1197](#fn_1196.md) For he did not say,
Grace be unto you and peace from God the Father, “through” our Lord
Jesus Christ; but, “from God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.”
Strange! how mighty is the love of God! we which were enemies and
disgraced, have all at once become saints and sons. For when he calls
Him Father, he shows them to be sons; and when he says sons, he has
unveiled the whole treasure of blessings.

<span id="vii.iii-p31"></span>Let us then keep showing a conversation
worthy of the gift, and hold on in peace and holiness. For other
dignities are but for a time, and are brought to an end along with this
life present, and may be bought with money (whence one might say they
are not dignities at all but names of dignities only, having their
strength in the investiture of fine array and the servility of
attendants), but this as having been given of God, the gift of
sanctification and adoption, is not broken through even by death, but
even here maketh men conspicuous, and also departs with us upon our
journey to the life to come. For he that holdeth on in the adoption, and
keeps an exact watch upon his holiness, is much brighter and more happy
even than he that is arrayed with the diadem itself, and has the purple;
and has the delight of abundant peace in the present life and is
nurtured up with goodly hopes, and hath no ground for worry and
disturbance, but enjoys constant pleasure; for as for good spirits and
joy, it is not greatness of power, not abundance of wealth, not pomp of
authority, not strength of body, not sumptuousness of the table, not the
adorning of dresses, nor any other of the things in man’s reach that
ordinarily produces them, but spiritual success, and a good conscience
alone. And he that hath this cleansed, even though he be clad in rags
and struggling with famine, is of better spirits than they that live so
softly. So too he that is conscious of wicked deeds, even though he may
gather to himself all men’s goods, is the most wretched of all men. For
this cause Paul, living in continual hunger and nakedness, and being
scourged every day was joyful, and went more softly than they that were
then emperors. But Ahab though a king, and indulging in a sumptuous
luxury, when he had done that one sin, groaned and was out of spirits,
and his countenance was fallen both before the sin and after the sin. If
then we wish to enjoy pleasure, above all things else let us shun
wickedness, and follow after virtue; since it is not in the nature of
things for one to have a share thereof on any other terms, even if we
were mounted upon the king’s throne itself. Wherefore also Paul saith,
“But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace.” ([Gal. v.

This fruit then let us keep growing by us, that we may be in the
fruition of joy here, and may obtain the kingdom to come, by the grace
and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, through Whom and with
Whom, be glory to the Father, and to the Holy Spirit, now and always,
even unto all ages. Amen.

<span id="vii.iii-p6"></span> This expression is significant as showing
the confidence of Chrys. in the Pauline authorship of the Epistle to the
Hebrews. It need hardly be said that the reason for the omission of the
Apostle’s name is purely fanciful and that the non-Pauline character of
the Epistle is almost demonstrable.—G.B.S.

<span id="fn_1190"></span>[i:1191](1110064.htm#fr_1190.md) <span

<span id="vii.iii-p8"></span> Or, “not in one way only.”

glory in the Incarnation.

<span id="fn_1192"></span>[i:1193](1110064.htm#fr_1192.md) <span
id="vii.iii-p10.2"></span>

<span id="vii.iii-p11"></span> It is noticeable that in the New
Testament the apostles call the body of believers “saints,” but never
apply this term to themselves or to one another. In later times the body
of believers returned the compliment and fixed the term as a title upon
the Apostles, New Testament writers, Church Fathers, and a large number
of Christians more or less distinguished for learning or piety. Most
Christians find the title more appropriate to the two first classes than
to the two last.—G.B.S.

<span id="vii.iii-p16"></span> Which the Fathers teach to be a type of
Christ upon the Cross. See on *Tert. Apol.* c. 30, p. 70. Oxf. Tr.

id="vii.iii-p22.8"></span>

<span id="vii.iii-p23"></span> Supposed to be a vague recollection of
St. [Luke 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#010.md), [Acts
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#010.md)<span
id="vii.iii-p23.1"></span>[Luke viii.
10](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#010.md)<span id="vii.iii-p23.2"></span>, or
of [Acts xix. 10](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#010.md)<span
id="vii.iii-p23.3"></span>.

<span id="fn_1195"></span>[i:1196](1110064.htm#fr_1195.md) <span
id="vii.iii-p23.7"></span>

<span id="vii.iii-p24"></span> The expression has also another important
bearing upon a question much debated by modern scholars, viz.: was the
Roman Church predominantly Jewish or Gentile? The Pauline usage is
strongly in favor of understanding by the words <span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.iii-p24.1"></span>τὰ& 158· θνη</span>
Gentiles as opposed to Jews. If this is correct the expression together
with <span class="Greek"><span id="vii.iii-p24.2"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.iii-p24.3"></span>ν οἷς ἐστὲ</span> would
seem decisive as showing the predominantly Gentile character of the
Roman Christian community.—G.B.S.

<span id="fn_1196"></span>[i:1197](1110064.htm#fr_1196.md) <span
id="vii.iii-p29.3"></span>

<span id="vii.iii-p30"></span> See St. Basil *de Spiritu Sancto,* c. 2,
4. and 5. St. Chrysostom is arguing against the Arian abuse of <span
id="vii.iii-p30.1"></span>[1 Cor. viii.
6](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#006.md)<span id="vii.iii-p30.2"></span>, as
he does on the passage itself.
