<span id="vii.xiv-p1"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vii.xiv-p1.1"></span>Homily XII.</span>

<span id="vii.xiv-p2"></span>[Rom. VI.
19](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#019.md)<span id="vii.xiv-p2.1"></span>

<span id="vii.xiv-p3"></span>“I speak after the manner of men because of
the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members (so 4
<span class="c14"><span id="vii.xiv-p3.1"></span>mss.</span> Sav. the
members of your flesh) servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto
iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto
holiness.”

<span id="vii.xiv-p4"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="vii.xiv-p4.1"></span>Since</span> he had required great strictness
of life, charging us to be dead to the world, and to have died unto
wickedness, and to abide with no notion towards the workings of sin, and
seemed to be saying something great and burdensome, and too much for
human nature; through a desire to show that he is not making any
exorbitant demand, nor even as much as might be expected of one who
enjoyed so great a gift, but one quite moderate and light, he proves it
from contraries, and says, “I speak after the manner of men,” as much as
to say, Going by human reasonings; by such as one usually meets with.
For he signifies either this, or the moderateness of it, by the term
applied, “after the manner of men.” For elsewhere he uses the same word.
“There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man” (<span
id="vii.xiv-p4.2"></span>[1 Cor. x.
13](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#013)<span id="vii.xiv-p4.3"></span>.md),
that is, moderate and small. “For as ye have yielded your members
servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield
your members servants to righteousness unto holiness.” And truly the
masters are very different ones, but still it is an equal amount of
servitude that I ask. For men ought to give a much larger one, and so
much the larger as this is a greater and better mastership than the
other. Nevertheless I make no greater demand “because of the infirmity,”
and that, he does not say of your free will or readiness of spirit, but
“of your flesh,” so making what he says the less severe. And yet on one
side there is uncleanness, on the other holiness: on the one iniquity,
and on the other righteousness. And who is so wretched, he says, and in
such straits as not to spend as much earnestness upon the service of
Christ, as upon that of sin and the devil? Hear then what follows, and
you will see clearly that we do not even spend this little. For when
(stated in this naked way) it does not seem credible or easy to admit,
and nobody would endure to hear that he does not serve Christ so much as
he did serve the devil, he proves it by what follows, and renders it
credible by bringing that slavery before us, and saying how they did
serve him. <span id="fr_1370"></span>[1371](#fn_1370.md)

<span id="vii.xiv-p6"></span>[Rom.
6.20](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#020.md)<span id="vii.xiv-p6.1"></span>.
“For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness.”

<span id="vii.xiv-p7"></span>Now what he says is somewhat of this kind,
When ye lived in wickedness, and impiety, and the worst of evils, the
state of compliance ye lived in was such that ye did absolutely no good
thing at all. For this is, “ye were free from righteousness.” That is ye
were not subject to it, but estranged from it wholly. For ye did not
even so much as divide the manner of servitude between righteousness and
sin, but gave yourselves wholly up to wickedness. Now, therefore, since
ye have come over to righteousness, give yourselves wholly up to virtue,
doing nothing at all of vice, that the measure you give may be at least
equal. And yet it is not the mastership only that is so different, but
in the servitude itself there is a vast difference. And this too he
unfolds with great perspicuity, and shows what conditions they served
upon then, and what now. And as yet he says nothing of the harm accruing
from the thing, but hitherto speaks of the shame.

<span id="vii.xiv-p8"></span>[Rom.
6.21](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#021.md)<span id="vii.xiv-p8.1"></span>.
“What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed?”

<span id="vii.xiv-p9"></span>So great was the slavery, that even the
recollection of it now makes you ashamed; but if the recollection makes
one ashamed, the reality would much more. And so you gained now in two
ways, in having been freed from the shame; and also in having come to
know the condition you were in; just as then ye were injured in two
ways, in doing things deserving shame, and in not even knowing to be
ashamed. And this is worse than the former. Yet still ye kept in a state
of servitude. Having then proved most abundantly the harm of what took
place then from the shame of it, he comes to the thing in question. Now
what is this thing? “For the end of those things is death.” Since then
shame seems to be no such serious evil, he comes to what is very
fearful, I mean death; though in good truth what he had before mentioned
were enough. For consider how exceeding great the mischief must be,
inasmuch as, even when freed from the vengeance due to it, they could
not get free of the shame. What wages then, he says, do you expect from
the reality, when from the bare recollection, and that too when you are
freed from the vengeance, you hide your face and blush, though under
such grace as you are! But God’s side is far otherwise.

<span id="vii.xiv-p10"></span>[Rom.
6.22](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#022.md)<span id="vii.xiv-p10.1"></span>.
“For now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have
your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.”

<span id="vii.xiv-p11"></span>Of the former, the fruit was shame, even
after the being set free. Of these the fruit is holiness, and where
holiness is, there is all confidence. But of those things the end is
death, and of these everlasting life. Do you see how he points out some
things as already given, and some as existing in hope, and from what are
given he draws proof of the others also, that is from the holiness of
the life. For to prevent your saying (i.e. as an objection) everything
lies in hope, he points out that you have already reaped fruits, first
the being freed from wickedness, and such evils as the very recollection
of puts one to shame; second, the being made a servant unto
righteousness; a third, the enjoying of holiness; a fourth, the
obtaining of life, and life too not for a season, but everlasting. Yet
with all these, he says, do but serve as ye served it. For though the
master is far preferable, and the service also has many advantages, and
the rewards too for which ye are serving, still I make no further
demand. Next, since he had mentioned arms and a king, he keeps on with
the metaphor in these words:

<span id="vii.xiv-p12"></span>[Rom.
6.23](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#023.md)<span id="vii.xiv-p12.1"></span>.
“For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life,
through Jesus Christ our Lord.”

<span id="vii.xiv-p13"></span>After speaking of the wages of sin, in the
case of the blessings, he has not kept to the same order (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.xiv-p13.1"></span>τάξιν</span>, rank or
relation): for he does not say, the wages of good deeds, “but the gift
of God;” to show, that it was not of themselves that they were freed,
nor was it a due they received, neither yet a return, nor a recompense
of labors, but by grace all these things came about. <span
id="fr_1371"></span>[1372](#fn_1371.md) And so there was a superiority for
this cause also, in that He did not free them only, or change their
condition for a better, but that He did it without any labor or trouble
upon their part: and that He not only freed them, but also gave them
much more than before, and that through His Son. And the whole of this
he has interposed as having discussed the subject of grace, and being on
the point of overthrowing the Law next. That these things then might not
both make them rather listless, he inserted the part about strictness of
life, using every opportunity of rousing the hearer to the practice of
virtue. For when he calls death the wages of sin, he alarms them again,
and secures them against dangers to come. For the words he uses to
remind them of their former estate, he also employs so as to make them
thankful, and more secure against any inroads of temptations. Here then
he brings the hortatory part to a stop, and proceeds with the doctrines
again, speaking on this wise.

<span id="vii.xiv-p15"></span>[Rom.
7.1](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#001.md)<span id="vii.xiv-p15.1"></span>.
“Know ye not, brethren, for I speak to them that know the Law.”

<span id="vii.xiv-p16"></span>Since then he had said, we are “dead to
sin,” he here shows that not sin only, but also the Law, hath no
dominion over them. But if the Law hath none, much less hath sin: and to
render his language palatable, he uses a human example to make this
plain by. And he seems to be stating one point, but he sets down at once
two arguments for his proposition. One, that when a husband is dead, the
woman is no longer subject to her husband, and there is nothing to
prevent her becoming the wife of another man: and the other, that in the
present case it is not the husband only that is dead but the wife also.
So that one may enjoy liberty in two ways. Now if when the husband is
dead, she is freed from his power, when the woman is shown to be dead
also, she is much more at liberty. For if the one event frees her from
his power, much more does the concurrence of both. As he is about to
proceed then to a proof of these points, he starts with an encomium of
the hearers, in these words, “Know ye not, brethren, for I speak to them
that know the Law,” that is, I am saying a thing that is quite agreed
upon, and clear, and to men too that know all these things accurately,

<span id="vii.xiv-p17"></span>“How that the Law hath dominion over a man
as long as he liveth?”

<span id="vii.xiv-p18"></span>He does not say, husband or wife, but
“man,” which name is common to either creature; “For he that is dead,”
he says, “is freed (Gr. justified) from sin.” The Law then is given for
the living, but to the dead it ceaseth to be ordained (or to give
commands). Do you observe how he sets forth a twofold freedom? Next,
after hinting this at the commencement, he carries on what he has to say
by way of proof, in the woman’s case, in the following way.

<span id="vii.xiv-p19"></span>[Rom.
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#002.md),
[3](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#003.md)<span id="vii.xiv-p19.1"></span>.
“For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the Law to her husband,
so long as he liveth: but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the
Law of her husband. So then, if while her husband liveth, she be married
to another man, she is called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead,
she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be
married to another man.”

<span id="vii.xiv-p20"></span>He keeps continually upon this point, and
that with great exactness, since he feels quite sure of the proof
grounded on it: and in the husband’s place he puts the Law, but in the
woman’s, all believers. Then he adds the conclusion in such way, that it
does not tally with the premiss; for what the context would require
would be, “and so, my brethren, the Law doth not rule over you, for it
is dead.” <span id="fr_1372"></span>[1373](#fn_1372.md) But he does not say
so, but only in the premiss hinted it, and in the inference, afterwards,
to prevent what he says being distasteful, he brings the woman in as
dead by saying,

<span id="vii.xiv-p22"></span>“Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are
become dead to the Law.”

<span id="vii.xiv-p23"></span>As then the one or the other event gives
rise to the same freedom, what is there to prevent his showing favor to
the Law without any harm being done to the cause? “For the woman which
hath an husband is bound by the Law to her husband as long as he
liveth.” What is become now (3 <span class="c14"><span
id="vii.xiv-p23.1"></span>mss.</span> then) of those that speak evil of
the Law? <span id="fr_1373"></span>[1374](#fn_1373.md) Let them hear, how
even when forced upon it, he does not bereave it of its dignity, but
speaks great things of its power; if while it is alive the Jew is bound,
and they are to be called adulterers who transgress it, and leave it
whiles it is alive. But if they let go of it after it has died, this is
not to be wondered at. For in human affairs no one is found fault with
for doing this: “but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law
of her husband.” You see how in the example he points out the Law as
dead, but in the inference he does not do so. So then if it be while her
husband liveth, the woman is called an adulteress. See how he dwells
upon the accusations of those who transgress the Law, while it is yet
living. But since he had put an end to it, he afterwards favors it with
perfect security, without doing any harm hereby to the faith. “For if
while her husband liveth, she be married to another man, she is called
an adulteress.” Thus it would have been natural to say next, ye also, my
brethren, now the Law is dead, will not be judged guilty of adultery, if
ye become married to another husband. Yet he does not use these words,
but what? “Ye are become dead to the Law;” if ye have been made dead, ye
are no longer under the Law. For if, when the husband is dead, the woman
is no longer liable to it, much more when herself is dead also she is
freed from the former. Do you note the wisdom of Paul, how he points out
that the Law itself designs that we should be divorced from it, and
married to another? For there is nothing, he means, against your living
with another husband, now the former is dead; for how should there be,
since when the husband was alive it allowed this to her who had a
writing of divorcement? <span id="fr_1374"></span>[1375](#fn_1374.md) But
this he does not set down, as it was rather a charge against the woman;
for although this had been granted, still it was not cleared of blame.
([Matt. 19:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#007.md),
[8](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#008)<span id="vii.xiv-p25.6"></span>..md)
For in cases where he has gained the victory by requisite and accredited
proofs, he does not go into questions beyond the purpose; not being
captious. The marvel then is this, that it is the Law itself that
acquits us who are divorced from it of any charge, and so the mind of it
was that we should become Christ’s. For it is dead itself, and we are
dead; and the grounds of its power over us are removed in a twofold way.
But he is not content with this alone, but also adds the reason of it.
For he has not set down death without special purpose, but brings the
cross in again, which had wrought these things, and in this way too he
puts us under an engagement. For ye have not been freed merely, he
means, but it was through the Lord’s death. For he says,

<span id="vii.xiv-p26"></span>“Ye are become dead to the Law by the Body
of Christ.”

<span id="vii.xiv-p27"></span>Now it is not on this only he grounds his
exhortation, but also on the superiority of this second husband. And so
he proceeds: “that ye should be married to another, even to Him Who is
raised from the dead.”

<span id="vii.xiv-p28"></span>Then to prevent their saying, If we do not
choose to live with another husband, what then? For the Law does not
indeed make an adulteress of the widow who lives in a second marriage,
but for all that it does not force her to live in it. Now that they may
not say this, he shows that from benefits already conferred, it is
binding on us to choose it: and this he lays down more clearly in other
passages, where he says, “Ye are not your own;” and, “Ye are bought with
a price;” and, “Be not ye the servants of men” (<span
id="vii.xiv-p28.1"></span>[1 Cor.
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#019.md),
[20](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#020.md)<span id="vii.xiv-p28.2"></span>;
vii. 23); and again, “One died for all, that they which live should not
henceforth live unto themselves, but unto Him which died for them.”
(<span id="vii.xiv-p28.3"></span>[2 Cor. v.
15](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#015)<span id="vii.xiv-p28.4"></span>..md)
This is then what he here alludes to in the words, “By the Body.” And
next he exhorts to better hopes, saying, “That we should bring forth
fruit unto God.” For then, he means, ye brought forth fruit unto death,
but now unto God.

<span id="vii.xiv-p29"></span>[Rom.
7.5](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#005.md)<span id="vii.xiv-p29.1"></span>.
“For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the
Law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.”

<span id="vii.xiv-p30"></span>You see then the gain to be got from the
former husband! And he does not say when we were in the Law, so in every
passage shrinking from giving a handle to heretics; <span
id="fr_1375"></span>[1376](#fn_1375.md) but “when we were in the flesh,”
that is, in evil deeds, in a carnal life. What he says then is, not that
they were in the flesh before, but now they went about without any
bodies; <span id="fr_1376"></span>[1377](#fn_1376.md) but by saying what he
does, he neither says that the Law is the cause of sins, nor yet frees
it from odium. For it held the rank of a bitter accuser, by making their
sins bare: since that, which enjoins more to him who is not minded to
obey at all, makes the offence greater. And this is why he does not say,
the “motions of sins” which were produced by the Law, but which “were
through the Law” (<span id="vii.xiv-p32.1"></span>[Rom. ii.
27](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#027)<span id="vii.xiv-p32.2"></span>.md),
without adding any “produced,” but simply “through the Law,” that is to
say, which through the Law were made apparent, were made known. Next
that he might not accuse the flesh either; he does not say which the
members wrought, but “which did work (or were wrought) in our members,”
to show that the origin of the mischief was elsewhere, from the thoughts
which wrought in us, not from the members which had them working in
them. For the soul ranks as a performer, and the fabric of the flesh as
a lyre, sounding as the performer obliges it. So the discordant tune is
to be ascribed not to the latter, but to the former sooner than to the
latter.

<span id="vii.xiv-p33"></span>[Rom.
7.6](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#006.md)<span id="vii.xiv-p33.1"></span>.
“But now,” he says, “we are delivered from the Law.” (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.xiv-p33.2"></span>κατηργήθημεν</span>, “made
of no effect.”)

<span id="vii.xiv-p34"></span>See how he again in this place spares the
flesh and the Law. For he does not say that the Law was made of no
effect, or that the flesh was made of no effect, but that we were made
of no effect (i.e., were delivered). And how were we delivered? Why by
the old man, who was held down by sin, being dead and buried. For this
is what he sets forth in the words, “being dead to that, wherein we were
held.” As if he had said, the chain by which we were held down was
deadened and broken through, so that that which held down, namely sin,
held down no more. But do not fall back or grow listless. For you have
been freed with a view to being servants again, though not in the same
way, but “in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.”
Now what does he mean here? for it is necessary to disclose it here,
that when we come upon the passage, we may not be perplexed with it.
When then Adam sinned (he means), and his body became liable to death
and sufferings, it received also many physical losses, and the
horse <span id="fr_1377"></span>[1378](#fn_1377.md) became less active and
less obedient. But Christ, when He came, made it more nimble for us
through baptism, rousing it with the wing of the Spirit. And for this
reason the marks for the race, which they of old time had to run, are
not the same as ours. <span id="fr_1378"></span>[1379](#fn_1378.md) Since
then the race was not so easy as it is now. For this reason, He desires
them to be clear not from murder only, as He did them of old time, but
from anger also; nor is it adultery only that He bids them keep clear
of, but even the unchaste look; and to be exempt not from false swearing
only, but even from true. ([Matt.
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#021.md),
[27](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#027.md),
[33](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#033)<span id="vii.xiv-p36.1"></span>..md)
And with their friends He orders them to love their enemies also. And in
all other duties, He gives us a longer ground to run over, and if we do
but obey, threatens us with hell, so showing that the things in question
are not matters of free-will offering for the combatants, as celibacy
and poverty are, but are binding upon us absolutely to fulfil. For they
belong to necessary and urgent requisites, and the man who does not do
them is to be punished to the utmost. This is why He said, “Except your
righteousness exceed the righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees, ye
shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.” ([Matt. v.
20](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#020)<span id="vii.xiv-p36.2"></span>..md)
But he that does not see the kingdom, shall certainly fall into hell.
For this cause Paul too says, “Sin shall not have dominion over you,
because ye are not under the Law, but under grace.” And here again,
“that ye should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of
the letter.” For it is not the letter that condemneth, that is the old
Law, but the Spirit that helpeth. And for this reason among the
ancients, if any were found practising virginity, it was quite
astonishing. But now the thing is scattered over every part of the
world. And death in those times some few men did with difficulty
despise, but now in villages and cities there are hosts of martyrs
without number, consisting not of men only, but even of women. <span
id="fr_1379"></span>[1380](#fn_1379.md) And next having done with this, he
again meets an objection which is rising, and as he meets it, gives
confirmation to his own object. And so he does not introduce the
solution of it as main argument, but by way of opposing this; that by
the exigency of meeting it, he may get a plea for saying what he wishes,
and make his accusation not so unpalatable. Having then said, “in the
newness of the Spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter,” he
proceeds.

<span id="vii.xiv-p38"></span>[Rom.
7.7](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#007.md)<span id="vii.xiv-p38.1"></span>.
“What then? is the Law sin? God forbid.”

<span id="vii.xiv-p39"></span>Even before this he had been saying, that
“the motions of sins, which were by the Law did work in our members”
([Rom. 7.5](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#005.md)<span
id="vii.xiv-p39.1"></span>): and, “sin shall have no dominion over you,
for ye are not under the Law.” ([Rom.
6.14](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#014)<span id="vii.xiv-p39.2"></span>..md)
And that “where no law is, there is no transgression.” ([Rom.
4.15](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#015)<span id="vii.xiv-p39.3"></span>..md)
And, “but the Law came in, that the offence might abound” ([Rom.
5.20](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#020)<span id="vii.xiv-p39.4"></span>.md);
and, “the Law worketh wrath.” ([Rom.
4.15](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#015)<span id="vii.xiv-p39.5"></span>..md)
Now as all these things seem to bring the Law into disrepute, in order
to correct the suspicion arising from them, he supposes also an
objection, and says, “What then, is the Law sin? God forbid.” Before the
proof he uses this adjuration to conciliate the hearer, and by way of
soothing any who was troubled at it. For so, when he had heard this, and
felt assured of the speaker’s disposition, he would join with him in
investigating the seeming perplexity, and feel no suspicions of him.
Wherefore he has put the objection, associating the other with him.
Hence, he does not say, What am I to say? but “What shall we say then?”
As though a deliberation and a judgment were before them, and a general
meeting called together, and the objection came forward not of himself,
but in the course of discussion, and from real circumstances of the
case. For that the letter killeth, he means, no one will deny, or that
the Spirit giveth life ([2 Cor. iii.
6](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#006)<span id="vii.xiv-p39.6"></span>.md);
this is plain too, and nobody will dispute it. If then these are
confessedly truths, what are we to say about the Law? that “it is sin?
God forbid.” Explain the difficulty then. Do you see how he supposes the
opponent to be present, and having assumed the dignity of the teacher,
he comes to the explaining of it. Now what is this? Sin, he says, the
Law is not. “Nay, I had not known sin, but by the Law.” Notice the reach
of his wisdom! What the Law is not, he has set down by way of objection,
so that by removing this, and thereby doing the Jew a pleasure, he may
persuade him to accept the less alternative. And what is this? Why that
“I had not known sin, but by the Law. For I had not known lust, except
the Law had said, Thou shalt not covet.”

<span id="vii.xiv-p40"></span>Do you observe, how by degrees he shows it
to be not an accuser of sin only, but in a measure its producer? Yet not
from any fault of its own, but from that of the froward Jews, he proves
it was, that this happened. For he has taken good heed to stop the
mouths of the Manichees, that accuse the Law; and so after saying, “Nay,
I had not known sin, but by the Law;” and, “I had not known lust, except
the Law had said, Thou shalt not covet;” he adds,

<span id="vii.xiv-p41"></span>[Rom.
7.8](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#008.md)<span id="vii.xiv-p41.1"></span>.
“But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner
of concupiscence.”

<span id="vii.xiv-p42"></span>Do you see how he has cleared it of all
blame? For “sin,” he says, “taking occasion by the commandment,” it was,
and not the Law, that increased the concupiscence, and the reverse of
the Law’s intent was brought about. This came of weakness, and not of
any badness. For when we desire a thing, and then are hindered of it,
the flame of the desire is but increased. Now this came not of the Law;
for it hindered us (3 <span class="c14"><span
id="vii.xiv-p42.1"></span>mss.</span> endeavored) of itself to keep us
off from it; but sin, that is, thy own listlessness and bad disposition,
used what was good for the reverse. But this is no fault in the
physician, but in the patient who applies the medicine wrongly. For the
reason of the Law being given was, not to inflame concupiscence, but to
extinguish it, though the reverse came of it. Yet the blame attaches not
to it, but to us. Since if a person had a fever, and wanted to take cold
drink when it was not good for him, and one were not to let him take his
fill of it, and so increase his lust after this ruinous pleasure, one
could not deservedly be found fault with. For the physician’s business
is simply prohibiting it, but the restraining himself is the patient’s.
And what if sin did take occasion from it? Surely there are many bad men
who by good precepts grow in their own wickedness. For this was the way
in which the devil ruined Judas, by plunging him into avarice, and
making him steal what belonged to the poor. However it was not the being
entrusted with the bag that brought this to pass, but the wickedness of
his own spirit. And Eve, by bringing Adam to eat from the tree, threw
him out of Paradise. But neither in that case was the tree the cause,
even if it was through it that the <span
id="fr_1380"></span>[1381](#fn_1380.md) occasion took place. But if he
treats the discussion about the Law with somewhat of vehemence, do not
feel surprise. For Paul is making a stand against the present exigency,
and suffers not his language to give a handle even to those that
suspected otherwise, but takes great pains to make the present statement
correct. Do not then sift what he is now going on to say (4 <span
class="c14"><span id="vii.xiv-p43.1"></span>mss.</span> “here saying”)
by itself, but put beside it the purpose by which he is led on to speak
of these things, and reckon for the madness of the Jews, and their
vigorous spirit of contention, which as he desires earnestly to do away
with, he seems to bear violently (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xiv-p43.2"></span>πολὺς πνεἵν</span>) against the Law, not to
find fault with it, but to unnerve their vigor. For if it is any
reproach to the Law that sin taketh occasion by it, this will be found
to be the case in the New Testament also. For in the New Testament there
are thousands of laws, and about many more (“far more,” Field) important
matters. And one may see the same come to pass there also, not with
regard to covetousness (lust, as [Rom.
7.7](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#007)<span id="vii.xiv-p43.3"></span>.md)
only, but to all wickedness generally. For He says, “if I had not come
and spoken unto them, they had not had sin,” (<span
id="vii.xiv-p43.4"></span>[John xv.
22](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#022)<span id="vii.xiv-p43.5"></span>..md)
Here then sin finds a footing in this fact, and so the greater
punishment. And again when Paul discourseth about grace, he says, “Of
how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be counted worthy, who
hath trodden under foot the Son of God.” ([Heb. x.
29](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#029)<span id="vii.xiv-p43.6"></span>..md)
Has not then the worse punishment its origin from hence, from the
greater benefit? And the reason why he says the Greeks were without
excuse was, because being honored with the gift of reason, and having
gotten a knowledge of the beauty of the creation, and having been placed
in a fair way for being led by it to the Creator, they did not so use
the wisdom of God, as it was their duty. Seest thou that to the wicked
in all cases occasions of greater punishment result from good things?
But we shall not in this accuse the benefits of God, but rather upon
this even admire them the more: but we shall throw the blame on the
spirit of those who abuse the blessings to contrary purpose. Let this
then be our line with regard to the Law also. But this is easy and
feasible—the other is what is a difficulty. How is it that he says “I
had not known lust except the Law had said, Thou shalt not covet?” Now
if man had not known lust, before he received the Law, what was the
reason for the flood, or the burning of Sodom? What does he mean then?
He means vehement lust: and this is why he did not say, lust, but “all
manner of concupiscence,” intimating, in that, its vehemency. And what,
it will be said, is the good of the Law, if it adds to the disorder?
None; but much mischief even. Yet the charge is not against the Law, but
the listlessness of those who received it. For sin wrought it, though by
the Law. But this was not the purpose of the Law, nay, the very
opposite, Sin then became stronger, he says, and violent. But this again
is no charge against the Law but against their obstinacy. “For without
the Law sin is dead.” That is, was not so ascertainable. For even those
before the Law knew that they had sinned, but they came to a more exact
knowledge of it after the giving of the Law. And for this reason they
were liable to a greater accusation: since it was not the same thing to
have nature to accuse them, and besides nature the Law, which told them
distinctly every charge.

<span id="vii.xiv-p44"></span>[Rom.
7.9](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#009.md)<span id="vii.xiv-p44.1"></span>.
“For I was alive without the Law once.”

<span id="vii.xiv-p45"></span>When, pray, was that? Before Moses. See
how he sets himself to show that it, both by the things it did, and the
things it did not do, weighed down human nature. For when “I was alive
without the Law,” he means, I was not so much condemned.

<span id="vii.xiv-p46"></span>“But when the commandment came, sin
revived, and I died.”

<span id="vii.xiv-p47"></span>This seems indeed to be an accusing of
theLaw. But if any one will look closely at it, it will be seen to be
even an encomium of it. For it did not give existence to sin that before
was not, but only pointed out what had escaped notice. And this is even
a praise of the Law, if at least before it they had been sinning without
perceiving it. But when this came, if they gained nothing besides from
it, at all events this they were distinctly made acquainted with, the
fact that they had been sinning. And this is no small point, with a view
to getting free from wickedness. Now if they did not get free, this has
nothing to do with the Law; which framed everything with a view to this
end, but the accusation lies wholly against their spirit, which was
perverse beyond all supposition. <span
id="fr_1381"></span>[1382](#fn_1381.md) For what took place was not the
natural thing,—their being injured by things profitable. And this is why
he says “And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be
unto death.” He does not say, “it was made,” or “it brought forth”
death, but “was found,” so explaining the novel and unusual kind of
discrepancy, and making the whole fall upon their own pate. For if, he
says, you would know the aim of it, it led to life, and was given with
this view. But if death was the issue of this, the fault is with them
that received the commandment, and not of this, which was leading them
to life. And this is a point on which he has thrown fresh light by what
follows.

<span id="vii.xiv-p49"></span>[Rom.
7.11](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#011.md)<span id="vii.xiv-p49.1"></span>.
“For sin taking occasion by the commandment deceived me, and by it slew
me.”

<span id="vii.xiv-p50"></span>You observe how he everywhere keeps to
sin, and entirely clears the Law of accusation. And so he proceeds as
follows.

<span id="vii.xiv-p51"></span>[Rom.
7.12](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#012.md)<span id="vii.xiv-p51.1"></span>.
“Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and
good.”

<span id="vii.xiv-p52"></span>But, if ye be so minded, we will bring
before you the language of those who wrest these declarations. For this
will make our own statements clearer. For there are some that say, that
he is not here saying what he does of the Law of Moses, but some take it
of the law of nature; some, of the commandment given in Paradise. Yet
surely Paul’s object everywhere is to annul this Law, but he has not any
question with those. And with much reason; for it was through a fear and
a horror of this that the Jews obstinately opposed grace. But it does
not appear that he has ever called the commandment in Paradise “Law” at
all; no, nor yet any other writer. Now to make this plainer from what he
has really said, let us follow out his words, retracing the argument a
little. Having then spoken to them about strictness of conversation, he
goes on to say, “Know ye not, brethren, how that the Law hath dominion
over a man as long as he liveth? Wherefore ye are become dead to the
Law.” Therefore if these things are said about the natural law, we are
found to be without the natural law. And if this be true, we are more
senseless than the creatures which are without reason. Yet this is not
so, certainly. For with regard to the law in Paradise, there is no need
to be contentious, lest we should be taking up a superfluous trouble, by
entering the lists against things men have made up their minds upon. In
what sense then does he say, “I should not have known sin but by the
Law?” He is speaking, not of absolute want of knowledge, but of the more
accurate knowledge. For if this were said of the law of nature, how
would what follows suit? “For I was alive,” he says, “without the Law
once.” Now neither Adam, nor any body else, can be shown ever to have
lived without the law of nature. For as soon as God formed him, He put
into him that law of nature, making it to dwell by him as a security to
the whole kind (Gr. Nature, see p. 365). And besides this, it does not
appear that he has anywhere called the law of nature a commandment. But
this he calls as well a commandment, and that “just and holy,” as a
“spiritual law.” But the law of nature was not given to us by the <span
id="fr_1382"></span>[1383](#fn_1382.md) Spirit. For barbarians, as well as
Greeks and other men, have this law. Hence it is plain, that it is the
Mosaic Law that he is speaking of above, as well as afterwards, and in
all the passages. For this cause also he calls it holy, saying,
“Wherefore the Law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and
good.” For even though the Jews have been unclean since the Law, and
unjust and covetous, this does not destroy the virtue of the Law, even
as their unbelief doth not make the faith of God of none effect. So from
all these things it is plain, that it is of the Law of Moses that he
here speaks.

<span id="vii.xiv-p54"></span>[Rom.
7.13](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#013.md)<span id="vii.xiv-p54.1"></span>.
“Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin
that it might appear sin.” (4 <span class="c14"><span
id="vii.xiv-p54.2"></span>mss.</span> om. <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xiv-p54.3"></span>ἡ</span>.)

<span id="vii.xiv-p55"></span>That is, that it might be shown what great
evil sin is, namely, a listless will, an inclinableness to the worse
side, the actual doing (3 <span class="c14"><span
id="vii.xiv-p55.1"></span>mss.</span> om. this clause), and the
perverted judgment. For this is the cause of all the evils; but he
amplifies it by pointing out the exceeding grace of Christ, and teaching
them what an evil He freed the human race from, which, by the medicines
used to cure it, had become worse, and was increased by the preventives.
Wherefore he goes on to say: “That sin, by the commandment, might become
exceeding sinful.” Do you see how these things are woven together
everywhere? By the very means he uses to accuse sin, he again shows the
excellency of the Law. Neither is it a small point which he has gained
by showing what an evil sin is, and unfolding the whole of its poison,
and bringing it to view. For this is what he shows, by saying, “that sin
by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.” That is, that it may
be made clear what an evil sin is, what a ruinous thing. And this is
what was shown by the commandment. Hereby he also shows the preëminence
of grace above the Law, the preëminence above, not the conflict with,
the Law. For do not look to this fact, that those who received it were
the worse for it; but consider the other, that the Law had not only no
design of drawing wickedness out to greater lengths, but even seriously
aimed at hewing down what already existed. But if it had no strength,
give to it indeed a crown for its intention, but adore more highly the
power of Christ, which abolished, cut away: and plucked up the very
roots an evil so manifold and so hard to be overthrown. But when you
hear me speak of sin, do not think of it as a substantial <span
id="fr_1383"></span>[1384](#fn_1383.md) power, but evil doing, as it comes
upon men and goes from them continually, and which, before it takes
place, has no being, and when it has taken place, vanishes again. This
then was why the Law was given. Now no law is ever given to put an end
to things natural, but in order to correct a way of acting purposely
wicked. And this the lawgivers that are without too are aware of, and
all mankind in general. For it is the evils from viciousness alone that
they are for setting right, and they do not undertake to extirpate those
allotted us along with our nature; since this they cannot do. For things
natural remain unalterable (Arist. *Eth.* b. 2, c. 1), as we have told
you frequently in other discourses also.

<span id="vii.xiv-p57"></span>And so let us leave these contests, and
again practise ourselves in exhortation. Or rather, this last part
belongs to those contests. For if we cast out wickedness, we should
bring virtue in also: and by these means we shall clearly teach that
wickedness is no natural evil, and shall be able easily to stop the
mouths of them that enquire for the origin of evil, not by means of
words only, but of actions also, since we share the same nature with
them, but are freed from their wickedness. For let us not be looking at
the laboriousness of virtue, but at the possibility of succeeding in it.
But if we be in earnest, it will be at once light and palatable to us.
But if you tell me of the pleasure of vice, tell out its end too. For it
issueth in death, even as virtue leadeth us to life. Or if you think fit
let us rather scrutinize them both even before their end; for we shall
see that vice has a great deal of pain attached to it, and virtue great
pleasure. For what pray is so painful as a bad conscience? or what more
pleasing than a good hope? For there is nothing, assuredly there is
nothing, which is used to cut us so deep, and press so hard on us, as
the expectation of evil: nothing that so keeps us up, and all but gives
us wings, as a good conscience. And this we may get a knowledge of even
by what takes place before our eyes. For they that dwell in a prison,
and are in expectation of sentence against them, let them have the
enjoyment of luxury repeated beyond count, live a more afflicting life
than those that go a begging by the by-roads, yet with nothing upon
their consciences to trouble them. For the expectation of a dreadful end
will not let them perceive those pleasures which they have in their
hands. And why do I speak of prisoners? Why, as for those that are
living out of prison, and have a good fortune, yet have a bad conscience
about them, handicraftsmen that work for their bread, and spend the
whole day amid their labor, are in a far better plight than they. And
for this reason too we say, How miserable the gladiators are (though
seeing them as we do in taverns, drunken, luxurious, gormandizing), and
call them the most miserable of men, because the calamity of the end
which they must expect is too great to admit of comparison with that
pleasure. Now if to them a life of this sort seems to be pleasing,
remember what I am continually telling you, that it is no such marvel
that a man who lives in vice should not flee from the misery and pain of
vice. For see how a thing so detestable as that, yet seems to be
delectable to those who practice it. Yet we do not on this account say,
how happy they are, for this is just the very reason why we think them
pitiable, because they have no notion of the evils they are amongst. And
what would you say of adulterers, who for a little pleasure undergo at
once a disgraceful slavery, and a loss of money, and a perpetual fear
(Hor. Sat. II. vii. 58–67), and in fact the very life of a Cain, or
rather one that is even much worse than his; filled with fears for the
present, and trembling for the future, and suspecting alike friend and
foe, and those that know about it, and those that know nothing? Neither
when they go to sleep are they quit of this struggle, their bad
conscience shaping out for them dreams that abound with sundry terrors,
and in this way horrifying them. Far otherwise is the chaste man, seeing
he passes the present life unshackled and at full liberty. Weigh then
against the little pleasure, the sundry fluctuations of these terrors,
and with the short labor of continency, the calm of an entire life; and
you will find the latter hath more of pleasantness than the former. But
as for the man that is set upon plundering and laying hands upon other
men’s goods, tell me if he has not to undergo countless pains in the way
of running about, fawning upon slaves, freemen, doorkeepers; alarming
and threatening, acting shamelessly, watching, trembling, in agony,
suspecting everything. Far otherwise is the man that holds riches in
contempt, for he too enjoys pleasure in abundance, and lives with no
fear, and in perfect security. And if any one were to go through the
other instances of vice, he would find much trouble, and many rocks. But
what is of greater importance is, that in the case of virtue the
difficulties come first, and the pleasant part afterwards, so the
trouble is even thus alleviated. But in the case of vice, the reverse.
After the pleasure, the pains and the punishments, so that by these
besides the pleasure is done away. For as he who waits for the crown,
perceives nothing of present annoyance, so he that has to expect the
punishments after the pleasures has no power of gathering in a gladness
that is unalloyed, since the fear puts everything in confusion. Or
rather if any one were to scrutinize the thing with care, even before
the punishment which follows upon these things, he would find that even
at the very moment when vice is boldly entered upon, a great deal of
pain is felt. And, if you think fit, let us just examine this in the
case of those who plunder other men’s goods. Or those who in any way get
together money, and setting aside the fears, and dangers, and trembling,
and agony, and care, and all these things, let us suppose the case of a
man, who has got rich without any annoyance, and feels sure about
maintaining his present fortune (which he has no means of doing, still
for all that let it be assumed for argument’s sake). What sort of
pleasure then is he to gather in from having so much about him? On the
contrary, it is just this very thing that will not let him be
glad-hearted. For as long as ever he desires other things besides, he is
still upon the rack. Because desire gives pleasure at the time it has
come to a stand. If thirsty, for instance, we feel refreshed, when we
have drunk as much as we wish; but so long as we keep thirsty, even if
we were to have exhausted all the fountains in the world, our torment
were but growing greater; even if we were to drink up ten thousand
rivers, our state of punishment were more distressing. And thou also, if
thou wert to receive the goods of the whole world, and still to covet,
wouldest make thy punishment the greater, the more things thou hadst
tasted of. Fancy not then, that from having gathered a great sum
together thou shalt have aught of pleasure, but rather by declining to
be rich. But if thou covetest to be rich thou wilt be always under the
scourge. For this is a kind of love that does not reach its aim; and the
longer journey thou hast gone, the further off thou keepest from the
end.

<span id="vii.xiv-p58"></span>Is not this a paradox then, a derangement,
a madness in the extreme? Let us then forsake this first of evils, or
rather let us not even touch this covetousness at all. Yet, if we have
touched it, let us spring away from its first motions (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.xiv-p58.1"></span>προοιμίων</span>). For
this is the advice the writer of the Proverbs gives us, when he speaks
about the harlot: “Spring away,” he says, “tarry not, neither go thou
near to the door of her house” (<span id="vii.xiv-p58.2"></span>[Prov.
v. 8](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#008)<span id="vii.xiv-p58.3"></span>.md):
this same thing I would say to you about the love of money. For if by
entering gradually you fall into this ocean of madness, you will not be
able to get up out of it with ease, and as if you were in
whirlpools, <span id="fr_1384"></span>[1385](#fn_1384.md) struggle as often
as ever you may, it will not be easy for you to get clear; so after
falling into this far worse abyss of covetousness, you will destroy your
own self, with all that belongs to you. ([Acts viii.
20](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#020)<span id="vii.xiv-p59.6"></span>..md)
And so my advice is that we be on our watch against the beginning, and
avoid little evils, for the great ones are gendered by these. For he who
gets into a way of saying at every sin, This matters nothing! will by
little and little ruin himself entirely. At all events it is this which
has introduced vice; which has opened the doors to the robber (5 <span
class="c14"><span id="vii.xiv-p59.7"></span>mss.</span> devil), which
has thrown down the walls of cities, this saying at each sin, “This
matters nothing!” Thus in the case of the body too, the greatest of
diseases grow up, when trifling ones are made light of. If Esau had not
first been a traitor to his birthright, he would not have become
unworthy of the blessings. If he had not rendered himself unworthy of
the blessings, he would not have had the desire of going on to
fratricide. If Cain had not fallen in love with the first place, but had
left that to God, he would not have had the second place. Again, when he
had the second place, if he had listened to the advice, he would not
have travailed with the murder. Again, if after doing the murder he had
come to repentance, when God called him, and had not answered in an
irreverent way, he would not have had to suffer the subsequent evils.
But if those before the Law did owing to this listlessness come to the
very bottom of misery, only consider what is to become of us, who are
called to a greater contest, unless we take strict heed unto ourselves,
and make speed to quench the sparks of evil deeds before the whole pile
is kindled. Take an instance of my meaning. Are you in the habit of
false swearing? do not stop at this only, but away with all swearing,
and you will have no further need of trouble. For it is far harder for a
man that swears to keep from false swearing, than to abstain from
swearing altogether. <span id="fr_1385"></span>[1386](#fn_1385.md) Are you
an insulting and abusive person? a striker too? Lay down as a law for
yourself not to be angry or brawl in the least, and with the root the
fruit also will be gotten rid of. Are you lustful and dissipated? Make
it your rule again not even to look at a woman ([Job xxxi.
1](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#001)<span id="vii.xiv-p60.7"></span>.md), or
to go up into the theatre, or to trouble yourself with the beauty of
other people whom you see about. For it is far easier not even to look
at a woman of good figure, than after looking and taking in the lust, to
thrust out the perturbation that comes thereof, the struggle being
easier in the preliminaries (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xiv-p60.8"></span>προοιμίοις</span>). Or rather we have no need
of a struggle at all if we do not throw the gates open to the enemy, or
take in the seeds of mischief (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xiv-p60.9"></span>κακίας</span>). And this is why Christ
chastised the man who looks unchastely upon a woman ([Matt. v.
28](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#028)<span id="vii.xiv-p60.10"></span>.md),
that He might free us from greater labor, before the adversary became
strong, bidding us cast him out of the house while he may be cast out
even with ease. For what need to have superfluous trouble, and to get
entangled with the enemies, when without entanglement we may erect the
trophy, and before the wrestling seize upon the prize? For it is not so
great a trouble not to look upon beautiful women, as it is while looking
to restrain one’s self. Or rather the first would be no trouble at all,
but immense toil and labor comes on after looking. Since then this
trouble is less (most <span class="c14"><span
id="vii.xiv-p60.11"></span>mss.</span> add, “to the incontinent”), or
rather there is no labor at all, nor trouble, but the greater gain, why
do we take pains to plunge into an ocean of countless evils? And
farther, he who does not look upon a woman, will overcome such lust not
only with greater ease, but with a higher purity, as he on the other
hand who does look, getteth free with more trouble, and not without a
kind of stain, <span id="fr_1386"></span>[1387](#fn_1386.md) that is, if he
does get free at all. For he that does not take a view of the beautiful
figure, is pure also from the lust that might result. But he who lusteth
to look, after first laying his reason low, and polluting it in
countless ways, has then to cast out the stain that came of the lust,
that is, if he do cast it out. This then is why Christ, to prevent our
suffering in this way, did not prohibit murder only, but wrath; not
adultery only, but an unchaste look even: not perjury only, but all
swearing whatsoever. Nor does he make the measure of virtue stop here,
but after having given these laws, He proceeds to a still greater
degree. For after keeping us far away from murder, and bidding us to be
clear of wrath, He bids us be ready even to suffer ill, and not to be
prepared to suffer no more than what he who attacks us pleases, but even
to go further, and to get the better of his utmost madness by the
overflowingness of our own Christian spirit (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xiv-p61.1"></span>τἥς οἱκείας φιγοσοφίας</span>). For what He
says is not, “If a man smite thee on thy right cheek, bear it nobly and
hold thy peace;” but He adds to this the yielding to him the other too.
For He says, “Turn to him the other also.” ([Matt. v.
39](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#039)<span id="vii.xiv-p61.2"></span>..md)
This then is the brilliant victory, to yield him even more than what he
wishes, and to go beyond the bounds of his evil desire by the
profuseness of one’s own patient endurance. For in this way you will put
a stop to his madness, and also receive from the second act again the
reward of the first, besides putting a stop to wrath against him. See
you, how in all cases it is we that have it in our power not to suffer
ill, and not they that inflict it? Or rather it is not the not suffering
ill alone, but even the having benefits (Sav. conj. <span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.xiv-p61.3"></span>παθεἵν εὖ</span>, so 2
<span class="c14"><span id="vii.xiv-p61.4"></span>mss.</span>) done us
that we have in our own power. And this is the truest wonder, that we
are so far from being injured, if we be right-minded, that we are even
benefited, and that too by the very things that we suffer unjustly at
the hands of others. Reflect then; has such an one done you an affront?
You have the power of making this affront redound to your honor. For if
you do an affront in return, you only increase the disgrace. But if you
bless him that did you the affront, you will see that all men give you
victory, and proclaim your praise. Do you see how by the things wherein
we are wronged, we get good done unto us if we be so minded? This one
may see happening in the case of money matters, of blows, and the same
in everything else. For if we requite them with the opposite, we are but
twining a double crown about us, one for the ills we have suffered, as
well as one for the good we are doing. Whenever then a person comes and
tells you that “such an one has done you an affront, and keeps
continually speaking ill of you to everybody,” praise the man to those
who tell you of him. For thus even if you wish to avenge yourself, you
will have the power of inflicting punishment. For those who hear you, be
they ever so foolish, will praise you, and hate him as fiercer than any
brute beast, because he, without being at all wronged, caused you pain,
but you, even when suffering wrong, requited him with the opposite. And
so you will have it in your power to prove that all that he said was to
no purpose. For he who feels the tooth of slander, gives by his vexation
a proof that he is conscious of the truth of what is said. But he who
smiles at it, by this very thing acquits himself of all suspicion with
those who are present. Consider then how many good things you cull
together from the affair. First, you rid yourself of all vexation and
trouble. Secondly (rather this should come first), even if you have
sins, you put them off, <span id="fr_1387"></span>[1388](#fn_1387.md) as
the Publican did by bearing the Pharisee’s accusation meekly. Besides,
you will by this practice make your soul heroic (Gr. philosophic), and
will enjoy endless praises from all men, and will divest yourself of any
suspicion arising from what is said. But even if you are desirous of
taking revenge upon the man, this too will follow in full measure, both
by God’s punishing him for what he has said, and before that punishment
by thy heroic conduct standing to him in the place of a mortal
blow. <span id="fr_1388"></span>[1389](#fn_1388.md) For there is nothing
that cuts those who affront us so much to the heart, as for us who are
affronted to smile at the affront. As then from behaving with Christian
heroism so many honors will accrue to us, so from being little-minded
just the opposite will befall us in everything. For we disgrace
ourselves, and also seem to those present to be guilty of the things
mentioned, and fill our soul with perturbation, and give our enemy
pleasure, and provoke God, and add to our former sins. Taking then all
this into consideration, let us flee from the abyss of a little mind
(<span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xiv-p63.2"></span>μικροψυχίας</span>), and take refuge in the
port of patient endurance (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xiv-p63.3"></span>μακροθυμίας</span>), that here we may at once
“find rest unto our souls” ([Matt. xi.
29](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#029)<span id="vii.xiv-p63.4"></span>.md),
as Christ also set forth, and may attain to the good things to come, by
the grace and love toward man, etc.

<span id="vii.xiv-p5"></span> The ground for Paul’s speaking “after the
manner of men because of the infirmity of their flesh” can hardly be, as
Chrys. suggests, because he would only demand for the service of the
gospel an earnestness equal to that which they had formerly displayed in
sin. The reference to the infirmity of their flesh gives the reason for
his manner of speech in illustrating the character of the Christian
life, rather than a ground for the moderatehess of his demand. His
meaning might be thus expressed: “I am carrying the figure of bondage to
its utmost length in applying it to righteousness because I wish to make
it clear to you that we are not in a lawless condition, but are still
*under authority;* hence I use the strongest language and press it
almost beyond its proper limits in calling our relation to God and
righteousness a *servitude.*”—G.B.S.

<span id="vii.xiv-p14"></span> [Rom.
6.23](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#023.md)<span id="vii.xiv-p14.1"></span>
is a confirmation of what he had said in [Rom.
6:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#021.md),
[22](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#022.md)<span id="vii.xiv-p14.2"></span>
about death and life. They are the results of the two courses spoken of.
The servant of sin receives death as his wages. It follows on the
principle of desert. Not so, however, on the other side. Respecting
eternal life there can be no thought of wages or deserts. There all is
grace. And thus Paul closes this refutation of objections by
triumphantly maintaining the praise of God’s grace in Christ, as he had
closed the argument constructed upon the parallel between Adam and
Christ ([Rom. 6.21](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#021.md)<span
id="vii.xiv-p14.3"></span>).—G.B.S.

<span id="fn_1372"></span>[i:1373](1110075.htm#fr_1372.md) <span
id="vii.xiv-p20.1"></span>

<span id="vii.xiv-p21"></span> Chrys. rightly apprehends the incongruous
logical form of the argument in [Rom.
7.1-6](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#001.md)<span id="vii.xiv-p21.1"></span>.
The Apostle starts out with a general principle: “The law rules a man as
long as he lives.” It is a question of the *man’s* living or dying not
of the *law’s.* Now ([Rom. 7.2](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#002.md)<span
id="vii.xiv-p21.2"></span>.) he introduces in confirmation of this a
specific example. He takes the case of a woman who is “under the law of
her husband.” Here the "law of the husband must correspond to <span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.xiv-p21.3"></span>ὁ</span> <span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.xiv-p21.4"></span>νόμος</span> of the
general principle; the <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xiv-p21.5"></span>γυνή</span> to <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xiv-p21.6"></span>ὁ</span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xiv-p21.7"></span>ἀνθρώπος</span> ([Rom.
7.1](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#001)<span id="vii.xiv-p21.8"></span>.md).
That is, the “husband” of the illustration corresponds to the “law” of
the general principle and the “woman” of the illustration to the “man”
of the principle. But in [Rom.
7.1](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#001.md)<span id="vii.xiv-p21.9"></span>,
it is a question of the man’s (not of the law’s) living or dying, while
in the illustration this order is reversed. Here it is a question of the
husband’s living or dying (who corresponds to the “law”) and not of the
wife’s, (who corresponds to the “man” of [Rom.
7.1](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#001)<span id="vii.xiv-p21.10"></span>.md).
How can this incongruity be explained? We answer that if Paul will use
the illustration from the dissolution of the marriage relation at all,
he can use it only as he has done. In order to make the illustration
harmonize *in form* with the principle ([Rom.
7.1](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#001)<span id="vii.xiv-p21.11"></span>.md)
and with the application ([Rom.
7.4](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#004)<span id="vii.xiv-p21.12"></span>..md)
it would be necessary to suppose the wife as dying and then marrying
again after death—which is impossible;—so that in order in any way to
carry out the idea of the wife’s marrying another (as illustrating the
Christian’s becoming free, as it were, from one husband—the law—and
joining himself to another—Christ), he must suppose the husband as dying
and not the wife. Nor can the thought which the apostle wishes to bring
out (the freedom to espouse another master) be brought out by adhering
to the form of [Rom. 7.1](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#001.md)<span
id="vii.xiv-p21.13"></span>. There it is the man who dies and so gets
free from the law, but with this figure it is impossible to take the
next step (which is necessary to the argument) and say: He being dead to
his former master, is free to take up allegiance to another. In order to
carry out the idea the thought of [Rom.
7.1](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#001.md)<span id="vii.xiv-p21.14"></span>
must change form and represent as dying, not the person under authority,
but the person exercising it. The essential point of the argument is,
that the relation of the Christian to the Mosaic law is as fully
terminated as the marriage bond is by the death of one of the parties.
There is in each case a termination *by death,* this term being used of
the relation of the Christian to the law as a strong figure. (Cf. <span
id="vii.xiv-p21.15"></span>[Rom. vi.
6](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#006.md)<span id="vii.xiv-p21.16"></span>,
where the “death” is predicated of the man, and <span
id="vii.xiv-p21.17"></span>[Gal. vi.
14](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#014.md)<span id="vii.xiv-p21.18"></span>
where it is applied to both terms in the relation of the Christian to
the world: “By whom the *world* is crucified unto me and *I* unto the
world.”) The key to the whole passage is the idea of *death*
figuratively applied to the termination of the Christian’s relation to
the law, and its central thought is, that having died to the law, we
must live unto Christ.—G.B.S.
