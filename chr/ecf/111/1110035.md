<span id="vi.xxx-p1"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vi.xxx-p1.1"></span>Homily XXX.</span>

<span id="vi.xxx-p2"></span>[Acts XIII.
42](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#042.md)<span id="vi.xxx-p2.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xxx-p3"></span>“And as they were going out (text rec. ‘from
the syn. of the Jews,’) they besought (the Gentiles) that these words
might be spoken unto them on the following sabbath.”

<span id="vi.xxx-p4"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="vi.xxx-p4.1"></span>Do</span> you mark Paul’s wisdom? He not only
gained admiration at the time, but put into them a longing desire for a
second hearing, while in what he said he dropped some seeds (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxx-p4.2"></span>εἰπών τινα σπέρματα</span>)
as it were, and forbore to solve (the questions raised), or to follow
out the subject to its conclusion, his plan being to interest them and
engage their good-will to himself, <span
id="fr_679"></span>[680](#fn_679) and not make (people.md) listless and
indifferent by casting all at once into the minds of those (who first
heard him). He told them the fact, that “through this Man is remission
of sins announced unto you,” but the how, he did not declare. “And when
the congregation was broken up, many of the Jews and worshipping
proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas”—after this point he puts Paul
first <span id="fr_680"></span>[681](#fn_680.md) —“who, speaking unto them,
persuaded them to continue in the grace of God.” ([Acts
13.43](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#043)<span id="vi.xxx-p6.3"></span>..md)
Do you observe the eagerness, how great it is? They “followed” them, it
says. Why did they not baptize them immediately? It was not the proper
time: there was need to persuade them in order to their steadfast
abiding therein. “And the next sabbath day came almost the whole city
together to hear the word of God.” ([Acts
13.44](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#044)<span id="vi.xxx-p6.4"></span>..md)
“But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with envy, and
contradicted the things spoken by Paul, contradicting and blaspheming.”
([Acts 13.45](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#045.md)<span
id="vi.xxx-p6.5"></span>.) See malice wounded in wounding others: this
made the Apostles more conspicuous—the contradiction which those
offered. In the first instance then they of their own accord besought
them to speak (and now they opposed them): “contradicting,” it says,
“and blaspheming.” O recklessness! “Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold,
and said, It was necessary that the word of God should first have been
spoken to you: but seeing ye put it from you, and judge yourselves
unworthy of everlasting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles.” ([Acts
13.46](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#046)<span id="vi.xxx-p6.6"></span>..md)
Do you mark how by their contentious behavior they the more extended the
preaching, and (how the Apostles here) gave themselves the more to the
Gentiles, having (by this very thing) pleaded their justification, and
made themselves clear of all blame with their own people (at Jerusalem)?
(*c*) See <span id="fr_681"></span>[682](#fn_681.md) how by their “envy”
they bring about great things, other (than they looked for): they
brought it about that the Apostles spake out boldly, and came to the
Gentiles! For this is why he says, “And speaking out boldly, Paul and
Barnabas said.” They were to go out to the Gentiles: but observe the
boldness coming with measure: <span id="fr_682"></span>[683](#fn_682.md)
for if Peter pleaded in his justification, much more these needed a
plea, none having called them there. ([Acts
11.4](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#004)<span id="vi.xxx-p8.11"></span>..md)
But by saying “To you first,” he showed that to those also it was their
duty (to preach), and in saying “Necessary,” he showed that it was
necessary to be preached to them also. “But since ye turn away from
it”—he does not say, “Woe unto you,” and “Ye are punished,” but “We turn
unto the Gentiles.” With great gentleness is the boldness fraught! (*a*)
Also he does not say, “Ye are unworthy,” but “Have judged yourselves
unworthy. Lo, we turn unto the Gentiles. For so hath the Lord commanded
us, saying, I have sent thee to be a light of the Gentiles, that thou
shouldest be for salvation unto the ends of the earth.” ([Acts
13.47](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#047)<span id="vi.xxx-p8.12"></span>..md)
For that the Gentiles might not be hurt at hearing this, as <span
id="fr_683"></span>[684](#fn_683.md) if the case were so that, had the Jews
been in earnest, they themselves would not have obtained the blessings,
therefore he brings in the prophecy, saying, “A light of the Gentiles,”
and, “for salvation unto the ends of the earth. And hearing” (this) “the
Gentiles” ([Acts 13.48](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#048.md)<span
id="vi.xxx-p9.5"></span>)—this, while it was more cheering to them,
seeing the case was this, that whereas those were of right to hear
first, they themselves enjoy the blessing, was at the same time more
stinging to those—“and the Gentiles,” it says, “hearing” (this) “were
glad, and glorified the word of the Lord: and believed, as many as were
ordained unto eternal life”: i.e., set apart for God. <span
id="fr_684"></span>[685](#fn_684.md) Observe how he shows the speediness of
the benefit: “And the word of the Lord was borne through all the
region,” ([Acts 13.49](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#049.md)<span
id="vi.xxx-p10.1"></span>) <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxx-p10.2"></span>διεφέρετο</span>, <span
id="fr_685"></span>[686](#fn_685.md) instead of <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxx-p11.4"></span>διεκομίζετο</span>, “was carried or conveyed
through (it).” (*d*) “But the Jews stirred up the devout and honorable
women, and the chief men of the city, and raised persecution against
Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them out of their coasts.” ([Acts
13.50](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#050)<span id="vi.xxx-p11.5"></span>..md)
“The devout women,” (*b*) <span id="fr_686"></span>[687](#fn_686.md)
instead of the proselyte-women. They did not stop at “envy,” but added
deeds also. *(e)* Do you see what they effected by their opposing the
preaching? to what dishonor they brought these (“honorable women”)? “But
they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came unto
Iconium.” ([Acts 13.51](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#051.md)<span
id="vi.xxx-p12.19"></span>.) Here now they used that terrible sign which
Christ enjoined, “If any receive you not, shake off the dust from your
feet” (<span id="vi.xxx-p12.20"></span>[Matt. x.
14](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#014.md)<span id="vi.xxx-p12.21"></span>;
[Mark vi. 11](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#011.md)<span
id="vi.xxx-p12.22"></span>); but these did it upon no light ground, but
because they were driven away by them. This was no hurt to the
disciples; on the contrary, they the more continued in the word: “And
the disciples were filled with joy, and with the Holy Ghost” ([Acts
13.52](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#052)<span id="vi.xxx-p12.23"></span>.md)
for the suffering of the teacher does not check his boldness, but makes
the disciple more courageous.

<span id="vi.xxx-p13"></span>“And it came to pass in Iconium, that they
went both together into the synagogue of the Jews.” ([Acts
14.1](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#001)<span id="vi.xxx-p13.1"></span>..md)
Again they entered into the synagogues. See how far they were from
becoming more timid! Having said, “We turn unto the Gentiles,”
nevertheless <span id="fr_687"></span>[688](#fn_687.md) (by going into the
synagogues) they superabundantly fortify their own justification (with
their Jewish brethren). “So that,” it says, “a great multitude both of
Jews and Greeks believed.” For it is likely they discoursed as to Greeks
also. “But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles, and made their
minds evil affected against the brethren.” ([Acts
14.2](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#002)<span id="vi.xxx-p14.5"></span>..md)
Together (with themselves) now they took to stirring up the Gentiles
too, as not being themselves sufficient. Then why did the Apostles not
go forth thence? Why, they were not driven away, only attacked. “Long
time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the Lord, which gave
testimony unto the word of His grace, and granted signs and wonders to
be done by their hands.” ([Acts
14.3](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#003)<span id="vi.xxx-p14.6"></span>..md)
This caused their boldness; or rather, of their boldness indeed their
own hearty good-will was the cause—therefore it is that for a long while
they work no signs—while the conversion of the hearers was (the effect)
of the signs, <span id="fr_688"></span>[689](#fn_688.md) though their
boldness also contributed somewhat. “But the multitude of the city was
divided: and part held with the Jews, and part with the Apostles.”
([Acts 14.4](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#004.md)<span
id="vi.xxx-p15.8"></span>.) No small matter this dividing. And this was
what the Lord said, “I am not come to bring peace, but a sword.” ([Matt.
x. 34](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#034)<span id="vi.xxx-p15.9"></span>..md)
“And when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles, and also of
the Jews with their rulers, to use them despitefully, and to stone them,
they were ware of it, and fled unto Lystra and Derbe, cities of
Lycaonia, and unto the region that lieth round about: and there they
preached the Gospel.” ([Acts
14.5-7](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#005.md)<span
id="vi.xxx-p15.10"></span>.) Again, as if they purposely wished to
extend the preaching after it was increased, they once more sent them
out. See on all occasions the persecutions working great good, and
defeating the persecutors, and making the persecuted illustrious. For
having come to Lystra, he works a great miracle, by raising the lame
man. <span id="fr_689"></span>[690](#fn_689.md) “And there sat a certain
man at Lystra, impotent in his feet, being a cripple from his mother’s
womb, who never had walked: the same heard Paul speak: who steadfastly
beholding him, and perceiving that he had faith to be healed, said with
a loud voice”—why with a loud voice? that the multitude should
believe—“Stand upright on thy feet.” ([Acts
14:8](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#008.md),
[9](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#009)<span id="vi.xxx-p16.11"></span>..md)
But observe, he gave heed, it says, to the things spoken by Paul. <span
id="fr_690"></span>[691](#fn_690.md) Do you mark the elevation of the man’s
mind (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxx-p17.3"></span>φιλοσοφίαν</span>)? He was nothing defeated
(<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxx-p17.4"></span>παρεβλάβη</span>) by
his lameness for earnestness of hearing. “Who fixing his eyes upon him,
and perceiving,” it says, “that he had faith to be made whole.” He was
already predisposed in purpose of mind. <span
id="fr_691"></span>[692](#fn_691.md) And yet in the case of the others, it
was the reverse: for first receiving healing in their bodies, they were
then taken in hand for cure of their souls, but this man not so. It
seems to me, that Paul saw into his soul. “And he leaped,” it says, “and
walked.” ([Acts 14.10](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#010.md)<span
id="vi.xxx-p18.4"></span>.) It was a proof of his perfect cure, the
leaping. “And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up
their voices, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come down
to us in the likeness of men. And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and
Paul, Mercurius, because he was the chief speaker. Then the priest of
Jupiter, which was before their city, brought oxen and garlands unto the
gates, and would have done sacrifice with the people.” ([Acts
14.11-13](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#011.md)<span
id="vi.xxx-p18.5"></span>.) But this purpose was not yet manifest, for
they spake in their own tongue, saying, “The gods in the likeness of men
are come down to us:” therefore the Apostle said nothing to them as yet.
But when they saw the garlands, then they went out, and rent their
garments, “Which when the Apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of, they
rent their clothes, and ran in among the people, crying out, and saying,
Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are men of like passions with
you.” ([Acts 14:14](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#014.md),
[15](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#015)<span id="vi.xxx-p18.6"></span>..md)
See how on all occasions they are clean from the lust of glory, not only
not coveting, but even repudiating it when offered: just as Peter also
said, “Why gaze ye on us, as though by our own power or holiness we had
made him to walk” ([Acts 3.12](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#012.md)<span
id="vi.xxx-p18.7"></span>)? so these also say the same. And Joseph also
said of the dreams, “Is not their interpretation of God?” (Gen. lx.
8<span id="vi.xxx-p18.8"></span>.) And Daniel in like manner, “And to me
also, not through the wisdom that is in me was it revealed.” ([Dan. ii.
30](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#030)<span id="vi.xxx-p18.9"></span>..md)
And Paul everywhere says this, as when he says, “And for these things
who is sufficient? Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think
(aught) as of ourselves, but our sufficiency is of God.” (<span
id="vi.xxx-p18.10"></span>[2 Cor. ii.
16](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#016.md)<span id="vi.xxx-p18.11"></span>;
iii. 5.) But let us look over again what has been said.

<span id="vi.xxx-p19"></span>(Recapitulation.) “And when they were gone
out,” etc. ([Acts 13.42](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#042.md)<span
id="vi.xxx-p19.1"></span>). Not merely were the multitudes drawn to
them, but how? they besought to have the same words spoken to them
again, and by their actions they showed their earnestness. “Now when the
congregation,” etc. ([Acts 13.43](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#043.md)<span
id="vi.xxx-p19.2"></span>.) See the Apostles on all occasions exhorting,
not merely accepting men, nor courting them, but, “speaking unto them,”
it says, “they persuaded them to continue in the grace of God. But when
the Jews,” etc. ([Acts 13.45](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#045.md)<span
id="vi.xxx-p19.3"></span>.) Why did they not contradict before this? Do
you observe who on all occasions they were moved by passion? And they
not only contradicted, but blasphemed also. For indeed malice stops at
nothing. But see what boldness of speech! “It was necessary,” he says,
“that the word should have been spoken first to you, but since ye put it
from you,”—([Acts 13.46](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#046.md)<span
id="vi.xxx-p19.4"></span>) it <span id="fr_692"></span>[693](#fn_692.md) is
not put as affronting (though) it is in fact what they did in the case
of the prophets: “Talk not to us,” said they, “with talk”—(<span
id="vi.xxx-p20.8"></span>[Is. xxx.
10](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#010)<span id="vi.xxx-p20.9"></span>.md):
“but since ye put it from you”—it, he saith, not us: for the affront on
your part is not to us. For that none may take it as an expression of
their piety (that he says,) “Ye judge not yourselves worthy,” therefore
he first says, “Ye put it from you,” and then, “We turn unto the
Gentiles.” The expression is full of gentleness. He does not say, We
abandon you, but so that it is possible—he would say—that we may also
turn hither again: and this too is not the consequence of the affront
from you, “for so hath (the Lord) commanded us.”—([Acts
13.47](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#047.md)<span
id="vi.xxx-p20.10"></span>.) “Then why have ye not done this?” <span
id="fr_693"></span>[694](#fn_693.md) It was indeed needful that the
Gentiles should hear, and this not before you: it is your own doing, the
“before you.” “For so hath the Lord commanded us: I have set thee for a
light of the Gentiles, that thou shouldest be for salvation,” i.e. for
knowledge which is unto salvation, and not merely of the Gentiles, but
of all men, “unto the ends of the earth—As many as were ordained unto
eternal life” ([Acts 13.48](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#048.md)<span
id="vi.xxx-p21.9"></span>.): this is also a proof, that their having
received these Gentiles was agreeable with the mind of God. But
“ordained,” not in regard of necessity: “whom He foreknew,” saith the
Apostle, “He did predestinate.” (<span id="vi.xxx-p21.10"></span>[Rom.
viii. 29](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#029.md)<span
id="vi.xxx-p21.11"></span>.) “And the word of the Lord,” etc. ([Acts
13.49](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#049.md)<span
id="vi.xxx-p21.12"></span>.) No longer in the city (only) were (their
doctrines) disseminated, but also in the (whole) region. For when they
of the Gentiles had heard it, they also after a little while came over.
“But the Jews stirred up the devout women, and raised
persecution”—observe even of what is done by the women, they are the
authors—“and cast them,” it says, “out of their coasts” ([Acts
13.50](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#050.md)<span
id="vi.xxx-p21.13"></span>), not from the city merely. Then, what is
more terrible, “they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and
came unto Iconium. But the disciples, it says, were filled with joy, and
with the Holy Ghost.” ([Acts 13:51](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#051.md),
[52](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#052)<span id="vi.xxx-p21.14"></span>..md)
The teachers were suffering persecution, and the disciples rejoiced.

<span id="vi.xxx-p22"></span>“And so spake, that a great multitude,”
etc. ([Acts 14.1](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#001.md)<span
id="vi.xxx-p22.1"></span>.) Do you mark the nature of the Gospel, the
great virtue it has? “Made their minds evil-affected,” it says, “against
the brethren:” ([Acts 14.2](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#002.md)<span
id="vi.xxx-p22.2"></span>.) i.e. slandered the Apostles, raised
numberless accusations against them: (these people, being simple, <span
id="fr_694"></span>[695](#fn_694.md) they “made evil-affected,” disposed
them to act a malignant part. And see how on all occasions he refers all
to God. “Long time,” he says, “abode they speaking boldly in the Lord,
which gave testimony unto the word of His grace.” ([Acts
14.3](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#003)<span id="vi.xxx-p23.6"></span>..md)
Think not this (expression, “Gave testimony,”) hath aught
derogatory <span id="fr_695"></span>[696](#fn_695.md) (to the Lord’s Divine
Majesty): “Who witnessed,” it is said, “before Pontius Pilate.” (<span
id="vi.xxx-p24.7"></span>[1 Tim. vi.
13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#013)<span id="vi.xxx-p24.8"></span>..md)
Then the boldness—“and granted signs and wonders to be done by their
hands.” Here he speaks it as concerning their own nation. “And the
multitude of the city,” etc. ([Acts
14:4](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#004.md),
[5](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#005)<span id="vi.xxx-p24.9"></span>..md)
Accordingly they did not wait for it, but saw the intention of attacking
them, <span id="fr_696"></span>[697](#fn_696.md) and fled, on no occasion
kindling their wrath, <span id="fr_697"></span>[698](#fn_697.md) “to the
cities of Lycaonia, Lystra, and Derbe, and the adjacent region.” ([Acts
14.6](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#006)<span id="vi.xxx-p26.7"></span>..md)
They went away into the country, not into the cities only.—Observe both
the simplicity of the Gentiles, and the malignity of the Jews. By their
actions they showed that they were worthy to hear: they so honored them
from the miracles only. The one sort honored them as gods, the other
persecuted them as pestilent fellows: and (those) not only did not take
offence at the preaching, but what say they? “The gods, in the likeness
of men, are come down to us;” but the Jews were offended. “And they
called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercurius.” ([Acts
14:11](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#011.md),
[12](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#012)<span id="vi.xxx-p26.8"></span>..md) I
suppose Barnabas was a man of dignified appearance also. Here was a new
sort of trial, from immoderate zeal, and no small one: but hence also is
shown the virtue of the Apostles, (and) how on all occasions they
ascribe all to God.

<span id="vi.xxx-p27"></span>Let us imitate them: let us think nothing
our own, seeing even faith itself is not our own, but more God’s (than
ours). <span id="fr_698"></span>[699](#fn_698.md) “For by grace are ye
saved through faith; and this,” saith he, “not of ourselves; it is the
gift of God.” ([Eph. ii. 8](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#008.md)<span
id="vi.xxx-p28.6"></span>.) Then let us not think great things of
ourselves, nor be puffed up, being as we are, men, dust and ashes, smoke
and shadow. For say, Why dost thou think great things of thyself? Hast
thou given alms, and lavished thy substance? And what of that? Think,
what if God had chosen not to make thee rich? think of them that are
impoverished, or rather, think how many have given (not their substance
only, but) their bodies moreover, and after their numberless sacrifices,
have <span id="fr_699"></span>[700](#fn_699.md) felt still that they were
miserable creatures! Thou gavest for thyself, Christ (not for Himself,
but) for thee: thou didst but pay a debt, Christ owed thee not.—See the
uncertainty of the future, and “be not high-minded, but fear” ([Rom. xi.
20](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#020)<span id="vi.xxx-p29.5"></span>.md); do
not lessen thy virtue by boastfulness. Wouldest thou do something truly
great? Never let a surmise of thy attainments as great enter thy mind.
But thou art a virgin? So were those in (the Gospel) virgins, but they
got no benefit from their virginity, because of their cruelty and
inhumanity. <span id="fr_700"></span>[701](#fn_700.md) ([Matt. xxv.
12](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#012)<span id="vi.xxx-p30.4"></span>..md)
Nothing like humility: this is mother, and root, and nurse,and
foundation, and bond of all good things: without this we are abominable,
and execrable, and polluted. For say—let there be some man raising the
dead, and healing the lame, and cleansing the lepers, but with <span
id="fr_701"></span>[702](#fn_701.md) proud self-complacency: than this
there can be nothing more execrable, nothing more impious, nothing more
detestable. Account nothing to be of thyself. Hast thou utterance and
grace of teaching? Do not for this account thyself to have aught more
than other men. For this cause especially thou oughtest to be humbled,
because thou hast been vouchsafed more abundant gifts. For he to whom
more was forgiven, will love more ([Luke vii.
47](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#047)<span id="vi.xxx-p31.3"></span>.md): if
so, <span id="fr_702"></span>[703](#fn_702.md) then oughtest thou to be
humbled also, for that God having passed by others, took notice of thee.
Fear thou because of this: for often this is a cause of destruction to
thee, if thou be not watchful. Why thinkest thou great things of
thyself? Because thou teachest by words? But this is easy, to
philosophize in words: teach me by thy life: that is the best teaching.
Sayest thou that it is right to be moderate, and dost thou make a long
speech about this thing, and play the orator, pouring forth thy
eloquence without a check? But “better than thou is he” shall one say to
thee, “who teaches me this by his deeds”—for not so much are those
lessons wont to be fixed in the mind which consist in words, as those
which teach by things: since if thou hast not the deed, thou not only
hast not profited him by thy words, but hast even hurt him the
more—“better thou wert silent.” Wherefore? “Because the thing thou
proposest to me is impossible: for I consider, that if thou who hast so
much to say about it, succeedest not in this, much more am I excusable.”
For this cause the Prophet says, “But unto the sinner said God. Why
declarest thou My statutes?” (<span id="vi.xxx-p32.2"></span>[Ps. lx.
16](../../../bib/kjv/psa060.htm#016)<span id="vi.xxx-p32.3"></span>..md)
For this is a worse mischief, when one who teaches well in words,
impugns the teaching by his deeds. This has been the cause of many evils
in the Churches. Wherefore pardon me, I beseech you, that my discourse
dwells long on this evil affection (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxx-p32.4"></span>πάθει</span>). Many take a deal of pains to be
able to stand up in public, and make a long speech: and if they get
applause from the multitude, it is to them as if they gained the very
kingdom (of heaven): but if silence follows the close of their speech,
it is worse than hell itself, the dejection that falls upon their
spirits from the silence! This has turned the Churches upside down,
because both *you* desire not to hear a discourse calculated to lead you
to compunction, but one that may delight you from the sound and
composition of the words, as though you were listening to singers and
minstrels (<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxx-p32.5"></span>κιθαρῳδὥν
καὶ κιθαριστὣν</span>, *supra* p. 68): and *we* too act a preposterous
and pitiable part in being led by your lusts, when we ought to root them
out. And <span id="fr_703"></span>[704](#fn_703.md) so it is just as if the
father of a poor cold-blooded child (already, more delicate than it
ought to be), should, although it is so feeble, give it cake and cold
(drink) and whatever only pleases the child, and take no account of what
might do it good; and then, being reproved by the physicians, should
excuse himself by saying, “What can I do? I cannot bear to see the child
crying.” Thou poor, wretched creature, thou betrayer! for I cannot call
such a one a father: how much better were it for thee, by paining him
for a short time, to restore him to health forever, than to make this
short-lived pleasure the foundation of a lasting sorrow? Just such is
our case, when we idly busy ourselves about beautiful expressions, and
the composition and harmony of our sentences, in order that we may
please, not profit: (when) we make it our aim to be admired, not to
instruct; to delight, not prick to the heart; to be applauded and depart
with praise, not to correct men’s manners! Believe me, I speak not other
than I feel—when as I discourse I hear myself applauded, at the moment
indeed I feel it as a man (for why should I not own the truth?): I am
delighted, and give way to the pleasurable feeling: but when I get home,
and bethink me that those who applauded received no benefit from my
discourse, but that whatever benefit they ought to have got, they lost
it while applauding and praising, I am in pain, and groan, and weep, and
feel as if I had spoken all in vain. I say to myself: “What profit comes
to me from my labors, while the hearers do not choose to benefit by what
they hear from us?” Nay, often have I thought to make a rule which
should prevent all applauding, and persuade you to listen with silence
and becoming orderliness. But bear with me, I beseech you, and be
persuaded by me, and, if it seem good to you, let us even now establish
this rule, that no hearer be permitted to applaud in the midst of any
person’s discourse, but if he will needs admire, let him admire in
silence: there is none to prevent him: and let all his study and eager
desire be set upon the receiving the things spoken.—What means that
noise again? <span id="fr_704"></span>[705](#fn_704.md) I am laying down a
rule against this very thing, and you have not the forbearance even to
hear me!—Many will be the good effects of this regulation: it will be a
discipline of philosophy. Even the heathen philosophers—we hear of their
discoursing, and nowhere do we find that noisy applause accompanied
their words: we hear of the Apostles, making public speeches, and yet
nowhere do the accounts add, that in the midst of their speeches the
hearers interrupted the speakers with loud expressions of approbation. A
great gain will this be to us. But let us establish this rule: in quiet
let us all hear, and speak the whole (of what we have to say). For if
indeed it were the case that we departed retaining what we had heard,
what I insist upon is, that even so the praise is not beneficial <span
id="fr_705"></span>[706](#fn_705.md) —but not to go too much into
particulars (on this point); let none tax me with rudeness —but since
nothing is gained by it, nay, it is even mischievous, let us loose the
hindrance, let us put a stop to the boundings, let us retrench the
gambollings of the soul. Christ spoke publicly on the Mount: yet no one
said aught, until He had finished His discourse. I do not rob those who
wish to be applauded: on the contrary, I make them to be more admired.
It is far better that one’s hearer, having listened in silence, should
by his memory throughout all time applaud, both at home and abroad, than
that having lost all he should return home empty, not possessed of that
which was the subject of his applauses. For how shall the hearer be
otherwise than ridiculous? Nay, he will be deemed a flatterer, and his
praises no better than irony, when he declares that the teacher spoke
beautifully, but what he said, this he cannot tell. This has all the
appearance of adulation. For when indeed one has been hearing minstrels
and players, it is no wonder if such be the case with him, seeing he
knows not how to utter the strain in the same manner: but where the
matter is not an exhibition of song or of voice, but the drift and
purport of thoughts and wise reflection (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxx-p35.6"></span>φιλοσοφίας</span>), and it is easy for every
one to tell and report what was said, how can he but deserve the
accusation, who cannot tell what the matter was for which he praised the
speaker? Nothing so becomes a Church as silence and good order. Noise
belongs to theatres, and baths, and public processions, and
market-places: but where doctrines, and such doctrines, are the subject
of teaching, there should be stillness, and quiet, and calm reflection,
and a haven of much repose (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxx-p35.7"></span>φιλοσοφία καὶ πολὺς ὁ λιμήν</span>). These
things I beseech and entreat: for I go about in quest of ways <span
id="fr_706"></span>[707](#fn_706.md) by which I shall be enabled to profit
your souls. And no small way I take this to be: it will profit not you
only, but us also. So shall we not be carried away with pride (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxx-p36.5"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxx-p36.6"></span>κτραχηλίζεσθαί</span>), not
be tempted to love praises and honor, not be led to speak those things
which delight, but those which profit: so shall we lay the whole stress
of our time and diligence not upon arts of composition and beauties of
expression, but upon the matter and meaning of the thoughts. Go into a
painter’s study, and you will observe how silent all is there. Then so
ought it to be here: for here too we are employed in painting portraits,
royal portraits (every one of them), none of any private man, by
means <span id="fr_707"></span>[708](#fn_707.md) of the colors of
virtue—How now? Applauding again? This is a reform not easy, but (only)
by reason of long habit, to be effected.—The pencil moreover is the
tongue, and the Artist the Holy Spirit. Say, during the celebration of
the Mysteries, is there any noise? any disturbance? when we are
baptizing (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxx-p37.5"></span>βαπτιζώμεθα</span>), when we are doing all the
other acts? Is not all Nature decked (as it were) with stillness and
silence? <span id="fr_708"></span>[709](#fn_708.md) Over all the face of
heaven is scattered this charm (of repose).—On this account are we evil
spoken of even among the Gentiles, as though we did all for display and
ostentation. But if this be prevented, the love of the chief seats also
will be extinguished. It is sufficient, if any one be enamoured of
praise, that he should obtain it after having been heard, when all is
gathered in. <span id="fr_709"></span>[710](#fn_709.md) Yea, I beseech you,
let us establish this rule, that doing all things according to God’s
will, we may be found worthy of the mercy which is from Him, through the
grace and compassion of His only begotten Son our Lord Jesus Christ,
with Whom to the Father together with the Holy Spirit be glory,
dominion, honor, now and ever, world without end. Amen.

<span id="vi.xxx-p10"></span> The expression: “As many as were ordained
to eternal life believed,” has been both minimized and exaggerated.
Chrys. points the way to its correct interpretation in saying: “set
apart for God” and adding later: “not in regard of necessity.” The
writer is by no means seeking to define a doctrine of the divine plan in
its bearing upon human self-determination, but pointing out a historical
sequence. Those who became believers were as truly so in God’s plan as
they are so in fact. The passage says nothing of the relation of God’s
ordainment to the believer’s choice. It is an example of the Pauline
type of thought which grounds salvation upon the eternal purpose of God.
Whoever are saved in fact, were saved in God’s purpose. If as matter of
fact they are saved on condition of faith and not through the
enforcement of a *decretum absolutum,* then it is certain that their
salvation as foreseen in God’s purpose does not exclude their
self-determination and personal acceptance.—G.B.S.

<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxx-p12.16"></span>διωκόμενοι</span> is

bear this meaning, and perhaps was substituted for some other word by
the copyist, who took it to mean, “They leave the Jews no excuse.”—The
connection is, It was not because they were less bold than when they
said, “We turn unto the Gentiles,” that they still went to the Jews
first: but *ex abundanti* they enabled themselves to say to their

affront is not to us. And he says it to show that in what he is going to
say, “Ye judge yourselves not worthy of eternal life,” he does not mean

id="vi.xxx-p24.3"></span>τε γὰρ ἔλεγον</span>, “Which witnessed,” saith
it, “before Pontius P., then the (His?) boldness was shown, but here he
speaks concerning the people:” what he meant is not easy to see, nor
does it much matter. Below, <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxx-p24.4"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxx-p24.5"></span>νταῦθα περὶ τοῦ λαοῦ φησιν</span>, i.e. the
<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxx-p24.6"></span>παρρησία</span> is in
reference to their own nation (Israel): they spake boldly to the
Gentiles, fearless of the reproaches of the Jews.

<span id="fn_696"></span>[i:697](1110035.htm#fr_696.md) <span
id="vi.xxx-p24.10"></span>

<span id="vi.xxx-p25"></span> It seems clear from the fact that the
apostles are said to have been aware ([Acts
14.6](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#006)<span id="vi.xxx-p25.1"></span>.md)
of what the Jews had done against them, that the word <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxx-p25.2"></span>ὁ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxx-p25.3"></span>ρμή</span> ([Acts
14.6](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#006)<span id="vi.xxx-p25.4"></span>.md)
can hardly mean an “assault” (A.V.) or even “onset” (R.V.) in the sense
of any open violence. There would be no propriety in Luke adding that
they became aware of an attack upon them. <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxx-p25.5"></span>῾</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxx-p25.6"></span>Ορμή</span> must have here the sense of
*appetitus animi*—a strong movement of mind, an intention to attack
them—“Trieb” “Drang.” (Meyer.) The word occurs in but one other passage
(<span id="vi.xxx-p25.7"></span>[Jas. iii.
4](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#004)<span id="vi.xxx-p25.8"></span>.md)
where the <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxx-p25.9"></span>ὁ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxx-p25.10"></span>ρμή</span> of the pilot is spoken of as
directing the ship, evidently, meaning the “purpose” or “intention.” (So
Trench, Gloag, Meyer, Lechler, Alford.)—G.B.S.

<span id="fn_697"></span>[i:698](1110035.htm#fr_697.md) <span
id="vi.xxx-p25.11"></span>

<span id="vi.xxx-p26"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxx-p26.1"></span>οὐδαμοῦ τὸν θυμὸν αὐτῶν ἐκκαίοντες</span>
(restored to its fitting-place after <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxx-p26.2"></span>κατέφυγον</span>), i.e. as on all occasions we
find them forbearing to kindle the wrath of their enemies, so here,
seeing the intended assault, they fled. Mod. text <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxx-p26.3"></span>ἔ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxx-p26.4"></span>νθα οὐδαμοῦ</span> and
<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxx-p26.5"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxx-p26.6"></span>κκαίειν ἦν</span>, “fled to
Derbe,” etc. where (the enemies) had nowhere power to let their wrath
blaze against them: so that they went away into the country-parts, etc.

<span id="fn_698"></span>[i:699](1110035.htm#fr_698.md) <span
id="vi.xxx-p27.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xxx-p28"></span> So the order must be restored instead of,
<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxx-p28.1"></span>καὶ τοῦτό φησι διὰ
πίστεως οὐκ ἐξ ἡμῶν· ἀλλὰ τὸ πλέον τοῦ Θεοῦ· Θεοῦ γὰρ φησι τὸ
δῶρον</span>. The mod. text, “And that it is not ours, but the more
(part) God’s:” hear Paul saying, “And this not of ourselves, it is the
gift of God:” omitting <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxx-p28.2"></span>διὰ πίστεως</span>, which is essential to the
sense.—Perhaps we may read, <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxx-p28.3"></span>καὶ τοῦτο, φησί, τὸ</span> <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxx-p28.4"></span>“</span><span

id="vi.xxx-p29.1"></span>ἑ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxx-p29.2"></span>αυτοὺς ἐταλάνισαν</span>, “not as thou, <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxx-p29.3"></span>ἑ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxx-p29.4"></span>αυτοὺς ἐμακάρισαν</span>.”

<span id="fn_700"></span>[i:701](1110035.htm#fr_700.md) <span
id="vi.xxx-p29.6"></span>

<span id="vi.xxx-p30"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxx-p30.1"></span>διὰ τὴν ὠμότητα καὶ τὴν ἀπανθρωπίαν</span>. A
strong expression, but so in the *Homily on the Parable of the Virgins,*
Matt. p. 751, Am. Ed. p. 470, he interprets that the oil is charity
(alms-giving), and that even virgins, lacking this, “are cast out with
the harlots:” <span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxx-p30.2"></span>καὶ τὸν
ἀπάνθρωπον καὶ τὸν ἀνελεήμονα ἵστησι μετ᾽ αὐτῶν</span> (sc. <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxx-p30.3"></span>τῶν πόρνων</span>).

<span id="fn_701"></span>[i:702](1110035.htm#fr_701.md) <span
id="vi.xxx-p30.5"></span>

<span id="vi.xxx-p31"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxx-p31.1"></span>μετὰ ἀπονοίας</span>, so Hom. xxxi. p. 196,
<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxx-p31.2"></span>οὐκ
ἀπενοήθησαν</span>, “they did not bear themselves proudly.”

<span id="fn_702"></span>[i:703](1110035.htm#fr_702.md) <span
id="vi.xxx-p31.4"></span>

<span id="vi.xxx-p32"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxx-p32.1"></span>οὐκοῦν καὶ ταπεινοῦσθαι χρή</span>. “if he to
whom most is forgiven, loveth most, so ought he to whom more is given,
to humble himself more.”

<span id="fn_703"></span>[i:704](1110035.htm#fr_703.md) <span
id="vi.xxx-p32.6"></span>

<span id="vi.xxx-p33"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxx-p33.1"></span>καὶ ταὐτὸν γίνεται, οἷον ἂν εἰ τις πατὴρ
ψυχροῦ</span> (mod. text om.) <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxx-p33.2"></span>καὶ πέρα τοῦ δέοντος μαλθακοῦ παιδίου κ. τ. λ.
πλακοῦντα ἐπιδῷ καὶ ψυχρὸν καὶ ὅσα τέρπει μόνον κ. τ. λ</span>. Erasmus
translates loosely, *videns puerum, quem supra modum tenere amat,
ægrotum, illi frigida et quæcumque oblectant, porrigat.* Ben., *si pater
nimis molli puero, etsi infirmanti, frigidam placentam et quæ solum
oblectant porrigat.* If the text be not corrupt, <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxx-p33.3"></span>πέρα τοῦ δ. μαλθ</span>.
may mean, “brought up more tenderly than need be although ill,” and
<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxx-p33.4"></span>ψυχροῦ</span>,
“silly.” But the <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxx-p33.5"></span>ψυχρὸν</span> following may rather imply the
physical sense as above expressed: the child is a poor creature, with no
warmth or life in it, yet the father instead of warm and nourishing
food, gives it cake and cold drink, etc.

<span id="fn_704"></span>[i:705](1110035.htm#fr_704.md) <span
id="vi.xxx-p33.6"></span>

<span id="vi.xxx-p34"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxx-p34.1"></span>Διὰ τί ἐκροτήσατε</span>; even now while he was
protesting against this evil custom, derived from the theatres, some of
the hearers could not refrain from expressing their approbation by
applause.—Comp. *de Sacerdot.* lib. v. init. *Hom.* xv. *in Rom.* fin,
*Hom,* vii. *in Laz.* §I. xvii. *in Matt.* §7.

<span id="fn_705"></span>[i:706](1110035.htm#fr_705.md) <span
id="vi.xxx-p34.2"></span>

<span id="vi.xxx-p35"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxx-p35.1"></span>μάλιστα μὲν οὐδὲ οὕτω χρήσιμος ὁ
ἔπαινος</span>. i.e. as appears from the context, “to the preacher:” it
does him no good, it is even a harm, both by hindering him (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxx-p35.2"></span>κώλυμα</span>) and by
elating his mind (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxx-p35.3"></span>σκιρτήματα καὶ πηδήματα τῆς ψυχῆς</span>). In
the intermediate clause, <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxx-p35.4"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxx-p35.5"></span>λλ᾽ οὐκ ἂν ἠκριβολογησάμην, μὴ μέ τις ἀγροικίας
γραφέτω</span>, the meaning implied seems to be—“as it would be easy to
show, were it not ungracious to point out to you how little your praise
is worth.”

<span id="fn_706"></span>[i:707](1110035.htm#fr_706.md) <span
id="vi.xxx-p35.8"></span>

<span id="vi.xxx-p36"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxx-p36.1"></span>Περίειμι γὰρ τούτους ζητῶν</span>. Read <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxx-p36.2"></span>τρόπους</span>. Mod. text
adds <span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxx-p36.3"></span>πάντας
εἰδένα</span> to the former sentence, and here ΙΙ. <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxx-p36.4"></span>γὰρ καὶ αὐτὸς τρόπους

<span id="fn_707"></span>[i:708](1110035.htm#fr_707.md) <span

<span id="vi.xxx-p37"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxx-p37.1"></span>διὰ τῶν χρωμάτων τῆς ἀρετἡς</span>. Erasm. and
Ben. ungrammatically, *propter (ob) coloris virtutem;* as meaning that
such is the virtue or value of the colors, that they are fit to be
employed only on imperial portraits. But the connection is plainly this:
“the colors are the hues of virtue, the pencil is the tongue, the Artist
the Holy Spirit.” In the next sentence the old text has: <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxx-p37.2"></span>οὐκ εὔκολον τοῦτο ἀλλὰ τὸ
μὴ πολλῇ συνηθεία κατορθωθῆναι</span>, which is corrupt, unless indeed
it may be construed, “but (it is) the not being, by reason of long
habit, successfully achieved: i.e. it only shows that I have not, such
is the force of long habit, succeeded in carrying my point.” The mod.
text <span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxx-p37.3"></span>Οὐκ εὐκ. τὸ

id="vi.xxx-p37.4"></span>καὶ τοῦτο οὐ φύσει ἀλλὰ τῷ συνηθεί& 139· πολλῇ
μήπω κατορθοῦν αὐτὸ μεμαθηκέναι</span>. “It seems to be no easy matter,
this: and this, not naturally, but by reason that from long habit you
have not yet learnt to effect this reformation.”

<span id="fn_708"></span>[i:709](1110035.htm#fr_708.md) <span
id="vi.xxx-p37.6"></span>

<span id="vi.xxx-p38"></span> <span class="Greek"><span

understand by <span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxx-p38.7"></span>τὰ
