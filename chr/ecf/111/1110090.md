id="vii.xxix-p1.1"></span>Homily XXVII.</span>

<span id="vii.xxix-p2"></span>[Rom. XIV.
25-27](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#025.md)<span id="vii.xxix-p2.1"></span>

<span id="vii.xxix-p3"></span>*“Now to Him that is of power to stablish
you according to my Gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ according
to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world
began, but now is made manifest, and (<span class="c14"><span
id="vii.xxix-p3.1"></span>mss.</span>* *<span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xxix-p3.2"></span>τε</span>which Sav. omits) by the Scriptures
of the Prophets, according to the commandment of the everlasting God,
made known to all nations for the obedience of faith: to God only wise,
to Him be glory through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.”* <span
id="fr_1620"></span>[1621](#fn_1620.md)

<span id="vii.xxix-p5"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="vii.xxix-p5.1"></span>It</span> is always a custom with Paul to
conclude his exhortation with prayers and doxologies. For he knows that
the thing is one of no slight importance. And it is out of
affectionateness and caution that he is in the habit of doing this. For
it is the character of a teacher devoted to his children, and to God,
not to instruct them in words only, but by prayer too to bring upon his
teaching the assistance which is from God. And this he does here also.
But the connection is as follows: “To Him that is of power to stablish
you, be glory for ever. Amen.” For he again clings to those weak
brethren, and to them he directs his discourse. For when he was
rebuking, he made all share his rebuke; but now, when he is praying, it
is for these that he wears the attitude of a suppliant. And after
saying, “to stablish,” he proceeds to give the mode of it, “according to
my Gospel;” and this was what one would do to show that as yet they were
not firmly fixed, but stood, though with wavering. Then to give a
trustworthiness to what he says, he proceeds, “and the preaching of
Jesus Christ;” that is, which He Himself preached. But if He preached
it, the doctrines are not ours, but the laws are of Him. And afterwards,
in discussing the nature of the preaching, He shows that this gift is
one of much benefit, and of much honor; and this he first proves from
the person of the declarer thereof, and then likewise from the things
declared. For it was glad tidings. Besides, from His not having made
aught of them known to any before us. And this he intimates in the
words, “according to the revelation of the mystery.” And this is a sign
of the greatest friendliness, to make us share in the mysteries, and no
one before us. “Which was kept secret since the world began, but now is
made manifest.” For it had been determined long ago, but was only
manifested now. How was it made manifest? “By the Scriptures of the
Prophets.” Here again he is releasing the weak person from fear. For
what dost thou fear? is it lest <span
id="fr_1621"></span>[1622](#fn_1621.md) thou depart from the Law? This the
Law wishes, this it foretold from of old. But if thou pryest into the
cause of its being made manifest now, thou art doing a thing not safe to
do, in being curious about the mysteries of God, and calling Him to
account. For we ought not with things of this nature to act as
busybodies, but to be well pleased and content with them. Wherefore that
he might himself put a check upon a spirit of this sort, he adds,
“according to the commandment of the everlasting God, for the obedience
of faith.” For faith requires obedience, and not curiosity. And when God
commands, one ought to be obedient, not curious. Then he uses another
argument to encourage them, saying “made known to all nations.” That is,
it is not thou alone but the whole world that is of this Creed, as
having had not man, but God for a Teacher. Wherefore also he adds,
“through Jesus Christ.” But it was not only made known, but also
confirmed. Now both are His work. And on this ground too the way it is
to be read is, <span id="fr_1622"></span>[1623](#fn_1622.md) “Now to Him
that is of power to stablish you through Jesus Christ;” and, as I was
saying, he ascribes them both to Him; or rather, not both of these only,
but the glory belonging (or ascribed, Gr. <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xxix-p7.2"></span>τὴν εἰς</span>) to the Father also. And this
too is why he said, “to Whom be glory forever, Amen.” And he uses a
doxology again through awe at the incomprehensibleness of these
mysteries. For even now they have appeared, there is no such thing as
comprehending them by reasonings, but it is by faith we must come to a
knowledge of them, for in no other way can we. He well says, “To the
only wise God.” For if you will only reflect how He brought the nations
in, and blended them with those who in olden time had wrought well, how
He saved those who were desperate, how He brought men not worthy of the
earth up to heaven, and brought those who had fallen from the present
life into that undying and unalterable life, and made those who were
trampled down by devils to vie with Angels, and opened Paradise, and put
a stop to all the old evils, and this too in a short time and by an easy
and compendious way, then wilt thou learn His wisdom;—when thou seest
that which neither Angels nor Archangels knew, they of the Gentiles
learnt on a sudden through Jesus. (2 <span class="c14"><span
id="vii.xxix-p7.3"></span>mss.</span> add “then wilt thou know His
power.”) Right then is it to admire His wisdom, and to give Him glory!
But thou keepest dwelling over little things, still sitting under the
shadow. And this is not much like one that giveth glory. For he who has
no confidence in Him, and no trust in the faith, does not bear testimony
to the grandeur of His doings. But he himself offers glory up in their
behalf, in order to bring them also to the same zeal. But when you hear
him say, “to the only wise God,” think not that this is said in
disparagement of the Son. For if all these things whereby His wisdom is
made apparent were done (or made, see [John i.
3](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#003)<span id="vii.xxix-p7.4"></span>.md) by
Christ, and without Him no single one, it is quite plain that he is
equal in wisdom also. What then is the reason of his saying “only?” To
set Him in contrast with every created being. After giving the
doxology <span id="fr_1623"></span>[1624](#fn_1623.md) then, he again goes
from prayer to exhortation, directing his discourse against the
stronger, and saying as follows:

<span id="vii.xxix-p9"></span>[Rom.
15.1](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#001.md)<span id="vii.xxix-p9.1"></span>.
“We then that are strong, ought”—it is “we ought,” not “we are so kind
as to.” What is it we ought to do?—“to bear the infirmities of the
weak.”

<span id="vii.xxix-p10"></span>See how he has roused their attention by
his praises, not only by calling them powerful, but also by putting them
alongside of himself. And not by this only, but by the advantage of the
thing he again allures them, and by its not being burdensome. For thou,
he says, art powerful, and art no whit the worse for condescending. But
to him the hazard is of the last consequence, if he is not borne with.
And he does not say the infirm, but the “infirmities of the weak,” so
drawing him and bending him to mercy. As in another place too he says,
“Ye that are spiritual restore such an one.” ([Gal. vi.
1](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#001)<span id="vii.xxix-p10.1"></span>..md)
Art thou become powerful? Render a return to God for making thee so. But
render it thou wilt if thou settest the weakness of the sickly right.
For we too were weak, but by grace we have become powerful. And this we
are to do not in this case only, but also in the case of those who are
weak in other respects. As, for instance, if any be passionate, or
insolent, or has any such like failing bear with him. And how is this to
be? Listen to what comes next. For after saying “we ought to bear,” he
adds, “and not to please ourselves.” <span
id="fr_1624"></span>[1625](#fn_1624.md)

<span id="vii.xxix-p12"></span>[Rom.
15.2](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#002.md)<span id="vii.xxix-p12.1"></span>.
“Let every one of us please his neighbor for his good to edification.”

<span id="vii.xxix-p13"></span>But what he says is this. Art thou
powerful? Let the weak have trial of thy power. Let him come to know thy
strength; please him. And he does not barely say please, but for his
good, and not barely for his good, lest the advanced person should say,
See I am drawing him to his good! but he adds, “to edification.” And so
if thou be rich or be in power, please not thyself, but the poor and the
needy, because in this way thou wilt at once have true glory to enjoy,
and be doing much service. For glory from things of the world soon flies
away, but that from things of the Spirit is abiding, if thou do it to
edification. Wherefore of all men he requires this. For it is not this
and that person that is to do it, but “each of you.” Then since it was a
great thing he had commanded them, and had bidden them even relax their
own perfectness in order to set right the other’s weakness; he again
introduces Christ, in the following words:

<span id="vii.xxix-p14"></span>[Rom.
15.3](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#003.md)<span id="vii.xxix-p14.1"></span>.
“For even Christ pleased not Himself.”

<span id="vii.xxix-p15"></span>And this he always does. For when he was
upon the subject of alms, he brought Him forward and said, “Ye know the
grace of the Lord, that though He was rich, yet for our sakes he became
poor.” (<span id="vii.xxix-p15.1"></span>[2 Cor. viii.
9](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#009)<span id="vii.xxix-p15.2"></span>..md)
And when he was exhorting to charity, it was from Him that he exhorted
in the words “As Christ also loved us.” (<span
id="vii.xxix-p15.3"></span>[Eph. v.
25](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#025)<span id="vii.xxix-p15.4"></span>..md)
And when he was giving advice about bearing shame and dangers, he took
refuge in Him and said, “Who for the joy that was set before Him endured
the Cross, despising the shame.” ([Heb. xii.
2](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#002)<span id="vii.xxix-p15.5"></span>.md).
So in this passage too he shows how He also did this, and how the
prophet proclaimed it from of old. Wherefore also he proceeds:

<span id="vii.xxix-p16"></span>“The reproaches of them that reproached
Thee fell upon Me.” ([Ps. lxix. 9](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#009.md)<span
id="vii.xxix-p16.1"></span>.) But what is the import of, “He pleased not
Himself?” He had power not to have been reproached, power not to have
suffered what He did suffer, had He been minded to look to His own
things. But yet He was not so minded. But through looking to our good He
neglected His own. And why did he not say, “He emptied Himself?” ([Phil.
ii. 7](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#007.md)<span
id="vii.xxix-p16.2"></span>.) It is because this was not the only thing
he wished to point out, that He became man, but that He was also
ill-treated, and obtained a bad reputation with many, being looked upon
as weak. For it says, “If Thou be the Son of God, come down from the
Cross.” ([Matt. xxvii. 40](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#040.md)<span
id="vii.xxix-p16.3"></span>). And, “He saved others, Himself He cannot
save.” ([Matt. 27.42](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#042.md)<span
id="vii.xxix-p16.4"></span>). Hence he mentions a circumstance which was
available for his present subject, and proves much more than he
undertook to do; for he shows that it was not Christ alone that was
reproached, but the Father also. “For the reproaches of them that
reproached Thee fell,” he says, “upon Me.” But what he says is nearly
this, What has happened is no new or strange thing. For they in the Old
Testament who came to have a habit of reproaching Him, they also raved
against His Son. But these things were written that we should not
imitate them. And then he supplies (Gr. anoints) them for a patient
endurance of temptations.

<span id="vii.xxix-p17"></span>[Rom.
15.4](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#004.md)<span id="vii.xxix-p17.1"></span>.
“For whatsoever things were written aforetime,” he says, “were written
for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the
Scriptures, might have hope.”

<span id="vii.xxix-p18"></span>That is, that we might not fall away,
(for there are sundry conflicts within and without), that being nerved
and comforted by the Scriptures, we might exhibit patience, that by
living in patience we might abide in hope. For these things are
productive of each other, patience of hope, and hope of patience. And
both of them are brought about by the Scriptures. Then he again brings
his discourse into the form of prayer, and says,

<span id="vii.xxix-p19"></span>[Rom.
15.5](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#005.md)<span id="vii.xxix-p19.1"></span>.
“Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be like-minded one
towards another, according to Christ Jesus.”

<span id="vii.xxix-p20"></span>For since he had given his own advice,
and had also urged the example of Christ, he added the testimony of the
Scriptures also, to show that with the Scripture Himself giveth patience
also. And this is why he said, “Now the God of patience and consolation
grant you to be like-minded one towards another, according to Christ
Jesus.” For this is what love would do, be minded toward another even as
toward himself. Then to show again that it is not mere love that he
requires, he adds, “according to Christ Jesus.” And this he does, in all
places, because there is also another sort of love. And what is the
advantage of their agreeing?

<span id="vii.xxix-p21"></span>[Rom.
15.6](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#006.md)<span id="vii.xxix-p21.1"></span>.
“That ye may with one mind,” he says, “and one mouth, glorify God, even
the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.”

<span id="vii.xxix-p22"></span>He does not say merely with one mouth,
but bids us do it with one will also. See how he has united the whole
body into one, and how he concludes his address again with a doxology,
whereby he gives the utmost inducement to unanimity and concord. Then
again from this point he keeps to the same exhortation as before, and
says,

<span id="vii.xxix-p23"></span>[Rom.
15.7](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#007.md)<span id="vii.xxix-p23.1"></span>.
“Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ also received us, to the
glory of God.”

<span id="vii.xxix-p24"></span>The example again is as before, and the
gain unspeakable. For this is a thing that doth God especial glory, the
being closely united. And so if even against thy will (Field “being
grieved for His sake,” after Savile, but against <span class="c14"><span
id="vii.xxix-p24.1"></span>mss.</span>) and for His sake, thou be at
variance with thy brother, consider that by putting an end to thine
anger thou art glorifying thy Master, and if not on thy brother’s
account, for this at all events be reconciled to him: or rather for this
first. For Christ also insists upon this upon all possible
grounds, <span id="fr_1625"></span>[1626](#fn_1625.md) and when addressing
His Father he said, “By this shall all men know that Thou hast sent Me,
if they be one.” (<span id="vii.xxix-p25.3"></span>[John xvii.
21](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#021)<span id="vii.xxix-p25.4"></span>..md)

<span id="vii.xxix-p26"></span>Let us obey then, and knit ourselves to
one another. For in this place it is not any longer the weak, but all
that he is rousing. And were a man minded to break with thee, do not
thou break also. Nor give utterance to that cold saying, “Him I love
that loveth me; if my right eye does not love me, I tear it out.” For
these are satanical sayings, and fit for publicans, and the little
spirit of the Gentiles. But thou that art called to a greater
citizenship, and are enrolled in the books of Heaven, art liable to
greater laws. Do not speak in this way, but when he is not minded to
love thee, then display the more love, that thou mayest draw him to
thee. For he is a member; and when by any force a member is sundered
from the body, we do everything to unite it again, and then pay more
attention to it. For the reward is the greater then, when one draws to
one a person not minded to love. For if He bids us invite to supper
those that cannot make us any recompense, that what goes for recompense
may be the greater, much more ought we to do this in regard to
friendship. Now he that is loved and loveth, does pay thee a recompense.
But he that is loved and loveth not, hath made God a debtor to thee in
his own room. And besides, when he loves thee he needs not much pains;
but when he loves thee not, then he stands in need of thy assistance.
Make not then the cause for painstaking a cause for listlessness; and
say not, because he is sick, that is the reason I take no care of him
(for a sickness indeed the dulling of love is), but do thou warm again
that which hath become chilled. But suppose he will not be warmed, “what
then?” is the reply. Continue to do thy own part. “What if he grow more
perverse?” He is but procuring to thee so much greater return, and shows
thee so much the greater imitator of Christ. For if the loving one
another was to be the characteristic of disciples (“For hereby,” He
says, “shall all men know that ye are My disciples, if ye love one
another”), ([John 13.35](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#035.md)<span
id="vii.xxix-p26.1"></span>) consider how great an one loving one that
hates us must be. For thy Master loved those that hated Him, and called
them to Him; and the weaker they were, the greater the care He showed
them; and He cried and said, “They that are whole need not a physician,
but they that are sick.” ([Matt. ix.
12](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#012)<span id="vii.xxix-p26.2"></span>..md)
And He deemed publicans and sinners worthy of the same table with Him.
And as great as was the dishonor wherewith the Jewish people treated
Him, so great was the honor and concern He showed for them, yea, and
much greater. Him do thou also emulate: for this good work is no light
one, but one without which not even he that is a martyr can please God
much, as Paul says. <span id="fr_1626"></span>[1627](#fn_1626.md) Say not
then, I get hated, and that is why I do not love. For this is why thou
oughtest to love most. And besides, it is not in the nature of things
for a man who loves to be soon hated, but brute as a person may be, he
loves them that love him. For this He says the heathens and the
publicans do. ([Matt. v. 46](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#046.md)<span
id="vii.xxix-p27.1"></span>.) But if every one loves those that love
him, who is there that would not love those who love while they are
hated? Display then this conduct, and cease not to use this word, “Hate
me as much as you may, I will not leave off loving thee,” and then thou
wilt humble his quarrelsomeness, and cast out all coldness. <span
id="fr_1627"></span>[1628](#fn_1627.md) For this disorder comes either from
excessive heat (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xxix-p28.4"></span>φλεγμονἥς</span>, inflammation), or from
coldness; but both of these is the might of love wont to correct by its
warmth. Did you never see those who indulge a base love beaten, spit
upon, called names, ill-treated in a thousand ways by those
fornicatresses? What then? Do the insults break off this love? In no
wise: they even kindle it the more. And yet they who do these things,
besides being harlots, are of a disreputable and low grade. But they who
submit to it, have often illustrious ancestors to count up, and much
other nobility to boast of. Yet still none of these things break the
tie, nor keep them aloof from her whom they love. And are we not ashamed
then to find what great power the love of the devil (v. p. 520) and the
demons hath, and not to be able to display as much in the love according
to God? Dost thou not perceive that this is a very great weapon against
the devil? Do you not see, that that wicked demon stands by, dragging to
himself the man thou hatest, and desiring to snatch away the member? And
dost thou run by, and give up the prize of the conflict? For thy
brother, lying between you, is the prize. And if thou get the better,
thou receivest a crown; but if thou art listless, thou goest away
without a crown. Cease then to give utterance to that satanical saying,
“if my eye hates me, I cannot see it.” <span
id="fr_1628"></span>[1629](#fn_1628.md) For nothing is more shameful than
this saying, and yet the generality lay it down for a sign of a noble
spirit. But nothing is more ignoble than all this, nothing more
senseless, nothing more foolish. <span
id="fr_1629"></span>[1630](#fn_1629.md) Therefore I am indeed quite grieved
that the doings of vice are held to be those of virtue, that looking
down on men, and despising them, should seem to be honorable and
dignified. And this is the devil’s greatest snare, to invest iniquity
with a good repute, whereby it becomes hard to blot out. For I have
often heard men taking credit to themselves at their not going near
those who are averse to them. And yet thy Master found a glory in this.
How often do not men despise (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xxix-p30.2"></span>διέπτυσαν</span>) Him? how often show
aversion to Him? Yet He ceaseth not to run unto them. Say not then that
“I cannot bear to come near those that hate me,” but say, that “I cannot
bear to despise (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xxix-p30.3"></span>διαπτύσαι</span>) those that despise me.”
This is the language of Christ’s disciple, as the other is of the
devil’s. This makes men honorable and glorious, as the other doth
shameful and ridiculous. It is on this ground we feel admiration for
Moses, because even when God said, “Let Me alone, that I may destroy
them in Mine anger,” (<span id="vii.xxix-p30.4"></span>[Exod. xxxii.
10](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#010)<span id="vii.xxix-p30.5"></span>.md)
he could not bear to despise those who had so often shown aversion to
him, but said, “If thou wilt forgive them their trespass, forgive it;
else blot out me also.” ([Exod.
32.32](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#032.md)<span
id="vii.xxix-p30.6"></span>.) This was owing to his being a friend of
God, and a copyer of Him. And let us not pride ourselves in things for
which we ought to hide our faces. Nor let us use the language of these
lewd fellows, that are the scum of men, I know how to scorn (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.xxix-p30.7"></span>καταπτύσαι</span>, spit
at) thousands. But even if another use it, let us laugh him down, and
stop his mouth for taking a delight in what he ought to feel ashamed of.
What say you, pray, do you scorn a man that believes, whom when
unbelieving Christ scorned not? Why do I say scorned not? Why He had
such love towards him, when he was vile and unsightly, as even to die
for him. He then so loved, and that such a person, and do you now, when
he has been made fair and admirable, scorn him; now he is made a member
of Christ, and hath been made thy Master’s body? Dost thou not consider
what thou art uttering, nor perceive what thou art venturing to do? He
hath Christ as a Head, and a Table, and a Garment, and Life, and Light,
and a Bridegroom, and He is everything to him, and dost thou dare to
say, “this fellow I despise?” and not this only, but thousands of others
along with him? Stay thee, O man, and cease from thy madness; get to
know thy brother. Learn that these be words of unreasonableness, and
frenzy, and say on the contrary, though he despise me ten thousand
times, yet will I never stand aloof from him. In this way thou wilt both
gain thy brother, and wilt live to the glory of God, and wilt share the
good things to come. To which God grant that we may all attain, by the
grace and love toward man, etc.

<span id="vii.xxix-p8"></span> The grammatical form of the doxology
presents a noticeable anacoluthon. The dative <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xxix-p8.1"></span>τῷ δυναμένῳ</span> is resumed in <span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.xxix-p8.2"></span>μόνῳ σοφῷ θεῷ</span> and
again in the relative <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xxix-p8.3"></span>ᾧ</span> *as if* the proposition begun with
the dative had been competed. Thus the previous datives are left without
grammatical government. <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xxix-p8.4"></span>ᾧ</span>, if read (many texts omit it) is to
be understood as referring to <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xxix-p8.5"></span>θεῷ</span>.—G.B.S.

down in regard to the treatment which should be accorded to the weak in
[Rom. 14](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#000.md)<span
id="vii.xxix-p11.2"></span>. The crowning consideration is that Christ
pleased not himself, but bore the burdens of the weak. This is presented
as the type of all Christian duty. In [Rom.
15.6](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#006.md)<span id="vii.xxix-p11.3"></span>
the construction usually preferred is (as in R.V.) “the God and Father
of our Lord Jesus Christ” (cf. [Eph.

Cor. p. 446 O.T. in some places he seems to speak exclusively of love to

carrying out of love toward God, see p. 515.

this construction as [Matt. xiii.
14](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#014)<span id="vii.xxix-p29.5"></span>.md),
and agrees with p. 537.
