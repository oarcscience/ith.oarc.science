<span id="vi.xxxi-p1"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vi.xxxi-p1.1"></span>Homily XXXI.</span>

<span id="vi.xxxi-p2"></span>[Acts
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#014.md),
[15](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#015.md)<span id="vi.xxxi-p2.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xxxi-p3"></span>“Which when the Apostles, Barnabas and
Paul, heard of, they rent their clothes, and ran in among the people,
crying out and saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are men of
like passions with you, and preach unto you that ye should turn from
these vanities unto the living God, which made heaven, and earth, and
the sea, and all things that are therein.”

<span id="vi.xxxi-p4"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="vi.xxxi-p4.1"></span>Mark</span> the vehemence with which all this
is done by the Apostles: “rent their clothes, ran in, cried out,” all
from strong affection of the soul, revolted <span
id="fr_710"></span>[711](#fn_710.md) by the things that were done. For it
was a grief, indeed a grief inconsolable, that they should needs be
thought gods, and introduce idolatry, the very thing which they came to
destroy! This also was a contrivance of the devil—but he did not
prevail. <span id="fr_711"></span>[712](#fn_711.md) But what say they? “We
also are men of like passions with you.” At the very outset they
overthrew the evil. They said not simply, “Men,” but “As ye.” Then, that
they may not seem to honor the gods, hear what they add: “Preaching unto
you, that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living God, Who
made heaven, the sea, and all things that are therein.” Observe how they
nowhere mention things invisible. <span
id="fr_712"></span>[713](#fn_712) (*b*.md) For <span
id="fr_713"></span>[714](#fn_713.md) they had learnt that one should study
not so much to say somewhat worthy of God, as to say what is profitable
for the hearers. (*a*) What then? if He be Maker of all things, why does
He not also attend to these things by His Providence?—“Who in times past
suffered all nations to walk in their own ways” ([Acts
14.16](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#016.md)<span
id="vi.xxxi-p8.1"></span>)—but wherefore He suffered them, this he does
not say, for at present he keeps to the matter of immediate importance,
nowhere bringing in the name of Christ. Observe, he does not wish to
swell the accusation against them, but <span
id="fr_714"></span>[715](#fn_714.md) rather that they themselves should
refer all to God. “Nevertheless, He left not Himself without witness, in
that He did good, giving you rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons,
filling your hearts with food and gladness.” ([Acts
14.17](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#017.md)<span
id="vi.xxxi-p9.18"></span>.) (*c*) See how covertly he puts the
accusation “in that He did good,” etc. And yet if God did this, He could
not have “let them alone;” on the contrary, they ought to be punished,
for that, enjoying so great benefits, they had not acknowledged Him, not
even as their feeder. <span id="fr_715"></span>[716](#fn_715.md) “From
heaven,” he says, “giving you rain.” Thus also David said, “From the
fruit of their corn and wine and oil were they made to abound” ([Ps. iv.
7](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#007)<span id="vi.xxxi-p10.7"></span>.md),
and in many places speaking of Creation, he brings forward these
benefits: and Jeremiah mentions first Creation, then Providence (shown)
by the rains, so that the Apostle here discourses as taught from those
Scriptures. “Filling,” he says, “with food and gladness.” (<span
id="vi.xxxi-p10.8"></span>[Jer. v.
24](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#024)<span id="vi.xxxi-p10.9"></span>..md)
With large liberality (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxi-p10.10"></span>φιλοτιμίας</span>) the food is given, not
merely for a frugal sufficiency, nor stinted by the need. “And saying
these things, they scarcely stopped the multitudes” ([Acts
14.18](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#018.md)<span
id="vi.xxxi-p10.11"></span>)—indeed by this very thing they gained most
admiration—“from sacrificing to them.” Do you observe that this was the
point with them to put an end to that madness? “But there came,” it
says, “certain Jews from Antioch and Iconium” ([Acts
14.19](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#019.md)<span
id="vi.xxxi-p10.12"></span>).—Indeed children of the devil, that not in
their own cities only, but also beyond them, they did these things, and
as much made it their study to make an end of the preaching, as the
Apostles were in earnest to establish it!—“and having persuaded the
multitude and stoned Paul, they dragged him out of the city.” (*e*) So
then, the Gentiles regarded them as gods, but these “dragged” him, “out
of the city, supposing he had been dead. Having persuaded the
multitude”—for it is not likely that all thus reverenced them. In the
very city in which they received this reverence, in the same were they
thus terribly ill treated. And this also profited the beholders. “Lest
any man,” he says, “should think of me above that which he seeth me to
be, or that he heareth aught from me.” ([Acts
14:20](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#020.md), [2 Cor.
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#006.md)<span
id="vi.xxxi-p10.13"></span>.)—“Howbeit as the disciples stood round
about him, he rose up and came into the city.” (*d*) Here is fulfilled
that saying, “My grace is sufficient for thee, for My strength is made
perfect in weakness.” (<span id="vi.xxxi-p10.14"></span>[2 Cor. xii.
9](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#009)<span id="vi.xxxi-p10.15"></span>..md)
Greater this than the raising of the lame man! *(f)* “Came into the
city.” Do you mark the zeal, do you mark how fervent he <span
id="fr_716"></span>[717](#fn_716.md) is, how set on fire! He came into the
city itself again: for proof that if on any occasion he did retire, it
was because he had sown the word, and because it was not right to
inflame their wrath. (*h*) Then they went over all the cities in which
they had been in danger. “And on the morrow,” it says, “he went forth
with Barnabas to Derbe. And when they had preached the Gospel to that
city, and had taught many, they returned again to Lystra, and to
Iconium, and Antioch, confirming the souls of the disciples, and
exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much
tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.” ([Acts
14:21](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#021.md),
[22](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#022)<span id="vi.xxxi-p11.4"></span>..md)
This they said, this they showed. But it is purposely so done, not only
by <span id="fr_717"></span>[718](#fn_717.md) the Apostles, but by the
disciples also, that they may learn from the very outset both the might
of the preaching, and that they must themselves also suffer such things,
that they may stand nobly, not idly gaping for the miracles, but much
more (ready) for the trials. Therefore also the Apostle himself said,
“Having the same conflict which ye saw in me and heard.” (<span
id="vi.xxxi-p12.6"></span>[Phil. i.
30](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#030)<span id="vi.xxxi-p12.7"></span>..md)
Persecutions succeeded to persecutions: wars, fightings, stonings. (*g*)
These things, not less than the miracles, both made them more
illustrious, and prepared for them a greater rejoicing. The Scripture
nowhere says that they returned rejoicing because they had done
miracles, but (it does say that they rejoiced), that “they were counted
worthy for that Name to suffer shame.” ([Acts
5.41](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#041)<span id="vi.xxxi-p12.8"></span>..md)
And this they were taught of Christ, saying, “Rejoice not that the
devils obey you.” (<span id="vi.xxxi-p12.9"></span>[Luke x.
20](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#020)<span id="vi.xxxi-p12.10"></span>..md)
For the joy indeed and without alloy is this, to suffer aught for
Christ’s sake. *(i)* “And that through much tribulation:” what sort of
cheering (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxi-p12.11"></span>προτροπή</span>) is this? how did they
persuade them, by telling them at the outset of tribulations? Then also
another consolation. <span id="fr_718"></span>[719](#fn_718.md) “And when
they had appointed for them elders in every Church, <span
id="fr_719"></span>[720](#fn_719.md) and had prayed with fasting, they
commended them to the Lord, on whom they believed.” ([Acts
14.23](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#023.md)<span
id="vi.xxxi-p14.6"></span>.) Do you mark Paul’s ardor?—Then other
consolation: “Commended them,” it says, “to the Lord. And after they had
passed throughout Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia. And when they had
preached the word in Perga, they went down into Attalia ([Acts
14:24](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#024.md),
[25](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#025)<span id="vi.xxxi-p14.7"></span>.md):
(*l*) and thence sailed to Antioch, from whence they had been
recommended to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled.”
([Acts 14.26](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#026.md)<span
id="vi.xxxi-p14.8"></span>.) Why do they come back to Antioch? To report
what had taken place yonder. And besides, there is a great purpose of
Providence concerned: for it was needful that they should thenceforth
preach with boldness to the Gentiles. They come therefore, reporting
these things, that they may be able to know them: and it is
providentially ordered, that just then came those who forbade to keep
company with the Gentiles in order that from Jerusalem they might obtain
great encouragement, and so go their ways with boldness. And besides, it
shows that in their temper there was nothing of self-will: for they
come, at the same time showing their boldness, in that without the
authority of those (at Jerusalem) they had preached to the Gentiles, and
their obedience, in that they refer the matter to them: for they were
not made arrogant, as (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxi-p14.9"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxi-p14.10"></span>πενοήθησαν</span>) having achieved so great
successes. “Whence,” it says, “they had been recommended to the grace of
God for the work which they had fulfilled.” And yet moreover the Spirit
had said, “Separate Me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have
called them.” ([Acts 13.2](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#002.md)<span
id="vi.xxxi-p14.11"></span>.) “And when they were come, and had gathered
the Church together, they rehearsed all that God had done with them, and
how He had opened the door of faith unto the Gentiles. And there they
abode long time with the disciples.” ([Acts
14:27](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#027.md),
[28](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#028)<span id="vi.xxxi-p14.12"></span>..md)
For the city being great had need of teachers.—But let us look over
again what has been said.

<span id="vi.xxxi-p15"></span>(Recapitulation.) “Which when the
Apostles,” etc. ([Acts 14.14](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#014.md)<span
id="vi.xxxi-p15.1"></span>). First by the sight they checked them, by
rending their garments. This did Joshua the son of Nun upon the occasion
of the defeat of the people. Then think not that this action was
unworthy of them: for such was the eagerness, they would not otherwise
have restrained it would not otherwise have quenched the conflagration
(<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxi-p15.2"></span>πύραν</span>).
Therefore when need is to do something that is fit to be done, let us
not decline it. For if even after all this they hardly persuaded them,
if they had not acted thus, what might have been the consequence? For if
they had not done thus, they would have been thought to make a show of
humility (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxi-p15.3"></span>ταπεινοθρονεἵν</span>), and to be all the more
desirous of the honor. And observe their language, how in rebuking it is
moderated, alike full of wonder and of rebuke. This above all it was
that hindered them, the saying, “Preaching unto you to turn from these
vanities unto God.” ([Acts 14.15](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#015.md)<span
id="vi.xxxi-p15.4"></span>.) We are men indeed, they say, but greater
than these: for these are dead things. Mark how they not only subvert
(the false), but teach (the true), saying nothing about things
invisible—“Who made,” say they, “heaven and earth, and the sea, and all
things that are therein. Who in times past,” etc. ([Acts
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#016.md),
[17](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#017)<span id="vi.xxxi-p15.5"></span>..md)
He names as witnesses even the years (in their courses). <span
id="fr_720"></span>[721](#fn_720.md) “And there came thither certain Jews,”
etc. ([Acts 14.19](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#019.md)<span
id="vi.xxxi-p16.8"></span>.) O that Jewish madness! Among a people that
had so honored the Apostles, they had the hardihood to come, and to
stone Paul. “And they dragged him out of the city,” being afraid of
those (others),—“Supposing he had been dead.” (*k*) “Howbeit,” etc. “and
came into the city.” ([Acts 14.20](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#020.md)<span
id="vi.xxxi-p16.9"></span>.) For that the spirits of the disciples might
not be downcast because they who were accounted gods suffered such
treatment, they came in unto them and discoursed. “Then on the morrow,”
etc. And observe, first he goes forth to Derbe, and then comes back to
Lystra and Iconium and Antioch, ([Acts
14.21](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#021.md)<span
id="vi.xxxi-p16.10"></span>) giving way to them while their passions are
roused, but when they have ceased, then attacking them again. Do you
mark, that it was not by (supernatural) grace that they managed all that
they did, but by their own diligence? “Confirming,” it says “the souls
of the disciples:” <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxi-p16.11"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxi-p16.12"></span>πιστηρίζοντες</span>, “further establishing;”
so that they were established, but they added more thereto. “And that we
must,” etc. ([Acts 14.22](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#022.md)<span
id="vi.xxxi-p16.13"></span>): they foretold (this), that they might not
be offended. “And when they had appointed for them,” etc. Again the
ordinations accompanied with fastings: and again fasting, that purifying
of our souls. (*m*) “And having prayed,” it says, “with fastings, they
commended them unto the Lord” ([Acts
14.23](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#023.md)<span
id="vi.xxxi-p16.14"></span>): they taught them to fast also in their
trials. (*o*) Why did they not make elders in Cyprus nor in Samaria?
Because the latter was near to Jerusalem, the former to Antioch, and the
word was strong there; whereas in those parts they needed much
consolation, especially they of the Gentiles, who behooved to have much
instruction. “And when they were come,” etc. ([Acts
14.27](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#027.md)<span
id="vi.xxxi-p16.15"></span>.) They came, teaching them that with good
reason had they been ordained by the Spirit. (*n*) They said not what
they themselves, but “what God had done with them.” It seems to me, that
they mean their trials. It was not for nothing that they come here, nor
to rest, but providentially guided by the Spirit, to the end that the
preaching to the Gentiles might be firmly established. (*p*) And mark
Paul’s ardor. He does not ask whether it be right to speak to Gentiles,
but he straightway speaks: therefore it is that he says, “I did not
refer myself to flesh and blood.” (<span
id="vi.xxxi-p16.16"></span>[Gal. i.
16](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#016)<span id="vi.xxxi-p16.17"></span>..md)

<span id="vi.xxxi-p17"></span>For it is indeed <span
id="fr_721"></span>[722](#fn_721.md) a great thing, a great, a generous
soul (like this)! How many have since believed, and none of them all has
shone like him! What we want is earnestness, exceeding ardor, a soul
ready to encounter death. Else is it not possible to attain unto the
Kingdom, not being crucified. Let us not deceive ourselves. For if in
war it is impossible to come off safe while living daintily, and
trafficking, and huckstering and idling, much more in this war. Or think
ye not that it is a war worse than all others? (*Infra,* p. 204, note
1.) “For we wrestle not,” he says, “against flesh and blood.” ([Eph. vi.
12](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#012)<span id="vi.xxxi-p18.4"></span>..md)
Since even while taking our meals and walking, and bathing, the enemy is
present with us, and knows no time of truce, except that of sleep only:
nay, often even then he carries on the war, injecting into us unclean
thoughts, and making us lewd by means of dreams. We watch not, we do not
rouse ourselves up, do not look to the multitude of the forces opposed
to us, do not reflect, that this very thing constitutes the greatest
misfortune—that though surrounded by so great wars, we live daintily as
in time of peace. Believe me, worse than Paul suffered may have to be
suffered now. Those enemies wounded him with stones: there is a wounding
with words, even worse than stones. What then must we do? The same that
he did: he did not hate those who cast stones at him, but after they had
dragged him out, he entered again into their city, to be a benefactor to
those who had done him such wrongs. If thou also endurest him who
harshly insults thee, and has done thee wrongs, then hast thou too been
stoned. Say not, “I have done him no injury.” For what injury had Paul
done, that he should be stoned? He was announcing a Kingdom, he was
bringing men away from error, and bringing them to God: benefits these,
worthy of crowns, worthy of proclamation by voice of herald, worthy of a
thousand good things—not of stones. And yet (far from resenting) he
did <span id="fr_722"></span>[723](#fn_722.md) just the contrary. For this
is the splendid victory. “And they dragged him,” ([Acts
14.19](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#019)<span id="vi.xxxi-p19.7"></span>.md)
it says. These too they often drag: but be not thou angry; on the
contrary, preach thou the word with gentleness. Hath one insulted thee?
Hold thy peace, and bless if thou canst, and thou also hast preached the
word, hast given a lesson of gentleness, a lesson of meekness. I know
that many do not so smart under wounds, as they do under the blow which
is inflicted by words: as indeed the one wound the body receives the
other the soul. But let us not smart, or rather feeling the smart let us
endure. Do you not see the pugilists, how, with their heads sorely
battered, they bite their teeth into their lips, and so bear their
smarts kindly? No need to grind the teeth, no need to bite (the lips).
Remember thy Master, and by the remembrance thou hast at once applied
the remedy. Remember Paul: reflect that thou, the beaten hast conquered,
and he the beater, is defeated; and by this hast thou cured the whole.
It <span id="fr_723"></span>[724](#fn_723.md) is the turning of the scale a
moment and thou hast achieved the whole: be not hurried away, do not
even move, thou hast extinguished the whole (fire). Great <span
id="fr_724"></span>[725](#fn_724.md) eloquence of persuasion there is in
suffering aught for Christ: thou preachest not the word of faith, but
thou preachest the word of patience (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxi-p21.7"></span>φιλοσοφίας</span>). But, you will say, the
more he sees my gentleness, the more he sets upon me. Is it for this
then that thou art pained, that he increases thy rewards the more?
“But <span id="fr_725"></span>[726](#fn_725.md) this is the way,” you say,
“to make him unbearable.” This is mere pretext of thine own littleness
of mind: on the contrary, the other is the way to make him unbearable,
namely, that thou avenge thyself. If God had known, that through
forbearance of revenge, the unjust became unbearable, He would not have
done <span id="fr_726"></span>[727](#fn_726.md) this Himself: on the
contrary, He would have said, Avenge thyself: but He knew, that other
than this is the more likely way to do good. Make not thou a law
contrary to God: do as He bids thee. Thou art not kinder than He that
made us. He hath said, “Bear to be wronged:” thou sayest, “I requite
wrong for wrong, that he may not become unbearable.” Hast thou then more
care for him than God has? Such talk is mere passion and ill temper,
arrogance and setting up laws against God’s laws. For even if the man
were hurt (by our forbearance), would it not be our duty to obey? When
God orders anything, let us not make a contrary law. “A submissive
answer,” we read, turneth away wrath” (<span
id="vi.xxxi-p23.5"></span>[Prov. xvi.
1](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#001)<span id="vi.xxxi-p23.6"></span>.md):
not an answer of opposition. If it profits thee, it profits him also:
but if it hurts thee who art to set him right, how much more will it
hurt him? “Physician, heal thyself.” Hath one spoken ill of thee?
Commend him thou. Hath he reviled thee? Praise him thou. Hath he plotted
against thee? Do him a kindness. Requite him with the contrary things,
if at least thou at all carest for his salvation and wish not thou to
revenge thine own suffering. And yet, you will say, though he has often
met with long-suffering from me he has become worse. This is not thine
affair, but his. Wilt thou learn what wrongs God suffered? They threw
down His altars, and slew His prophets (<span
id="vi.xxxi-p23.7"></span>[1 Kings xix.
10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#010)<span id="vi.xxxi-p23.8"></span>.md),
yet He endured it all. Could He not have launched a thunderbolt from
above? Nay, when He had sent His prophets, and they killed them, then He
sent His Son ([Matt. xxi. 37](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#037.md)<span
id="vi.xxxi-p23.9"></span>), when they wrought greater impieties, then
He sent them greater benefits. And thou too, if thou seest one
exasperated, then yield the more: since this madness has greater need of
soothing (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxi-p23.10"></span>παραμθίας</span>). The more grievous his
abuse of thee, the more meekness does he need from thee: and even as a
gale <span id="fr_727"></span>[728](#fn_727.md) when it blows strong, then
it requires yielding to, so also he who is in a passion. When the wild
beast is most savage, then we all flee: so also should we flee from him
that is angry. Think not that this is an honor to him: for is it an
honor we show to the wild beast, and to madmen, when we turn aside out
of their way? By no means it is a dishonor and a scorn: or rather not
dishonor and scorn, but compassion and humanity. Seest thou not how the
sailors, when the wind blows violently, take down their sails, that the
vessel may not sink? how, when the horses have run away with the driver,
he only leads them into the (open) plain, and does not pull against them
that he may not voluntarily exhaust his strength? This do thou also.
Wrath is afire, it is a quick flame needing fuel: do not supply food to
the fire, and thou hast soon extinguished the evil. Anger has no power
of itself; there must be another to feed it. For thee there is no
excuse. He is possessed with madness, and knows not what he does; but
when thou, seeing what he is, fallest into the same evils, and art not
brought to thy right senses by the sight, what excuse can there be for
thee? If coming to a feast thou see at the very outset of the feast some
one drunken and acting unseemly, would not he, who after seeing him
makes himself drunk, be much more inexcusable? Just so it is here. Do we
think it any excuse to say, I was not the first to begin? This is
against us, that even the sight of the other in that condition did not
bring us to our right senses. It is just as if one should say, “I did
not murder him first.” For this very thing makes thee deserving of
punishment, that even upon the warning of such a spectacle thou didst
not restrain thyself. If thou shouldest see the drunken man in the act
of vomiting, retching, bursting, his eyes strained, filling the table
with his filthiness, everybody hurrying out of his way, and then
shouldest fall into the same state thyself, wouldest thou not be more
hateful? Like him is he that is in a passion: more than he who vomits,
he has his veins distended, his eyes inflamed, his bowels racked; he
vomits forth words far more filthy than that food; all crude what he
utters, nothing duly digested, for his passion will not let it be. But
as in that case excess of fumes (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxi-p24.11"></span>χυμων</span>), making an uproar in the
stomach, often rejects all its contents; so here, excess of heat, making
a tumult in the soul suffers him not to conceal what it were right to
leave unsaid, but things fit and unfit to be spoken, he says all alike,
not putting the hearers but himself to shame. As then we get out of the
way of those that vomit, so let us from those who are angry. Let us cast
dust upon their vomit: By doing what? <span
id="fr_728"></span>[729](#fn_728.md) By holding our peace: let us call the
dogs to eat up the vomit. I know that ye are disgusted at hearing this:
but I wish you to feel this same disgust when ye see these things take
place, and not to be pleased at the thing. The abusive man is filthier
than the dog that returneth to its own vomit. For if indeed having
vomited once he were done with it, he would not be like that dog: but if
he vomits the same things again, it is plain that he does so from having
eaten the same again. What then is more abominable than such an one?
What filthier than that mouth which chews such food? And yet this is a
work of nature, but the other not or rather both the one and the other
are contrary to nature. How? Since it is not according to nature to be
causelessly abusive, but against nature: he speaks nothing then like a
man, but part as beast, part as madman. As then the disease of the body
is contrary to nature, so also is this. And to show that it is contrary
to nature, if he shall continue in it, he will perish by little and
little: but if he continue in that which is natural, he will not perish.
I had rather sit at table with a man who eats dirt, than with one who
speaks such words. See ye not the swine devouring dung? So also do
these. For what is more stinking than the words which abusive men utter?
It is their study to speak nothing wholesome, nothing pure, but whatever
is base, whatever is unseemly, that they study both to do and say: and
what is worse, they think to disgrace others, while they in fact are
disgracing themselves. For that it is themselves they disgrace is plain.
For, leaving out of the question those who speak lies (in their
railings), say it be some notorious harlot, or even from the stage some
other (abandoned creature), and let that person be having a fight with
some other person: then let the latter cast this up to the former (what
she or he is), and the former retort upon the latter the same reproach:
which of them is most damaged by the words? For <span
id="fr_729"></span>[730](#fn_729.md) the former is but called what in fact
he or she is, which is not the case with the other: so that the first
gets nothing more in the way of shame (than there was before), while to
the other there accrues a great accession of disgrace. But again, let
there be some hidden actions (mod. text <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxi-p26.7"></span>εἰργασμένα</span> “which have been done”), and
let only the person abusing know of them: then, holding his peace until
now, let him openly parade (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxi-p26.8"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxi-p26.9"></span>κπομπευέτω</span>) the reproach: even so, he
himself is more disgraced than the other. How? by making himself the
herald of the wickedness, so <span id="fr_730"></span>[731](#fn_730.md)
getting for himself either the imputation of not being privy to any such
thing, or the character of one not fit to be trusted. And you shall see
all men forthwith accuse him: “If indeed he had been privy to a murder
being done, he ought to have revealed it all:” and so they regard him
with aversion as not human even, they hate him, they say he is a wild
beast, fierce and cruel: while the other they pardon much rather than
him. For we do not so much hate those that have wounds, as those that
compel one to uncover and show them. Thus that man has not only
disgraced the other, but himself as well and his hearers, and the common
nature of men: he has wounded the hearer, done no good. For this reason
Paul says: “If there be any word that is good for edifying, that it may
minister grace unto the hearers.” ([Eph. iv.
29](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#029)<span id="vi.xxxi-p27.14"></span>..md)
Let us get a tongue speaking only good things, that we may be lovely and
amiable. But indeed, everything is come to that pitch of wickedness,
that many boast of the very things, for which they should hide their
faces. For the threats of the many are of this kind: “thou canst not
bear my tongue,” say they. Words, these, worthy only of a woman, of an
abandoned drunken old hag, one of those that are dragged (to
punishment) <span id="fr_731"></span>[732](#fn_731.md) in the forum, a
procuress. Nothing more shameful than these words, nothing more unmanly,
more womanlike, than to have your strength in the tongue, and to think
great things of yourself because you can rail, just like the fellows in
processions, like the buffoons, parasites, and flatterers. Swine they
are rather than men, who pride themselves upon this. Whereas you should
(sooner) have buried yourself, and if another gave you this character,
should recoil from the charge as odious and unmanly, instead of that you
have made yourself the herald of (your own) disgrace (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxi-p28.2"></span>ὓ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxi-p28.3"></span>βρεων</span>). But you
will not be able to hurt him you speak ill of. Wherefore I beseech you,
considering how the wickedness is come to such a height, that many boast
of it, let us return to our senses, let us recover those who are thus
mad, let us take away these councils <span
id="fr_732"></span>[733](#fn_732.md) out of the city, let us make our
tongue gracious, let us rid it of all evil speaking, that being clean
from sins, we may be able to draw down upon us the good-will from above,
and to have mercy vouchsafed unto us from God, through the grace and
compassion of His only-begotten Son, with Whom to the Father, together
with the Holy Spirit, be glory, might, honor, now and ever, world
without end. Amen.

“the nations of the world, or their doings:” but the sense perhaps would

corruption of <span class="Greek"><span

not One also direct all by His Providence:” i.e. if One Creator, why not
One Providence? Why imagine a number of inferior Providences?—Mod. text

the sequence of the parts in the old text: in the mod. text a partial
restoration of the order has been attempted. The “method” of the

1; (*a, b*): then four portions taken alternately in the order 1, 3, 2,
4. (*c* to *f*): then again two portions in the order 2, 1, (*g, h*):

<span id="fn_715"></span>[i:716](1110036.htm#fr_715.md) <span
id="vi.xxxi-p9.19"></span>

<span id="vi.xxxi-p10"></span> There was doubtless something polemic in
the words of [Acts 14:16](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#016.md),
[17](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#017.md)<span id="vi.xxxi-p10.1"></span>
inasmuch as the apostle ascribes to the “living God” alone the blessings
which the heathen were wont to attribute to their divinities. The
language has also a conciliatory element. Their guilt is mitigated, no
doubt, by their limited light, but by no means removed, because God had
given them evidences of his goodness and power in the return of seasons
and harvests. The thought is closely akin to that in the address at
Athens ([Acts 17.23-31](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#023.md)<span
id="vi.xxxi-p10.2"></span>) where God is said to have overlooked the
times of the ignorance of the heathen, and to that of <span
id="vi.xxxi-p10.3"></span>[Rom. i.
18-32](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#018.md)<span id="vi.xxxi-p10.4"></span>;
[Rom. 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#014.md),
[15](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#015.md)<span id="vi.xxxi-p10.5"></span>,
where emphasis is laid upon the revelation of God to the heathen world
which renders their sinful lives without excuse. The three passages
combined yield the following ideas: (1) God has revealed Himself to the
heathen in nature and conscience. (2) This revelation is sufficient to
found responsibility. (3) As obedience to this inner law would merit
God’s approval ([Rom. ii. 14](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#014.md)<span
id="vi.xxxi-p10.6"></span>), so disobedience to it would merit his
displeasure. (4) As matter of fact the Gentiles have not followed the
light which they had and thus they have wickedly brought upon themselves
the wrath of God and the penalties of his moral law.—G.B.S.

<span id="vi.xxxi-p14"></span> The appointment of elders in every church
(which the apostles visited on this journey) is made by Paul and
Barnabas. Meyer supposes that the apostles only superintended the
popular choice by the church itself. The word employed (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxi-p14.1"></span>χειροτονέω</span>),
meaning to stretch forth the hand, as in voting would seem especially
appropriate to the idea of a popular election, but the participle here
employed (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxi-p14.2"></span>χειροτονήσαντες</span>) has not *the church*
but Paul and Barnabas for its subject. It seems necessary, therefore, to
take it in the general and derived sense—to elect—to choose. There were
several elders for each church as there had been several for each
synagogue, the model for the constitution of the early churches. They
were also called bishops (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxi-p14.3"></span>επίσκοποι</span>). These with the deacons were
the only church officers. (<span id="vi.xxxi-p14.4"></span>[Phil. i.
1](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#001)<span id="vi.xxxi-p14.5"></span>..md)
Their duty was to be leaders, teachers, and rulers in the churches. They
were at once pastors, teachers and rulers. Their functions were
coördinate. No one of them was above the others in any particular
church. Each church had several co-pastors, teachers or bishops.—G.B.S.

class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxi-p24.9"></span>νεμος</span> as an
interlinear correction arose the absurd reading <span

<span id="vi.xxxi-p25"></span> In the mod. text <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxi-p25.1"></span>τὶ ποιοῦντες</span>; is
placed before <span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxi-p25.2"></span>Κονιν
επιβ</span> and <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxi-p25.3"></span>σιγῶντες</span> is connected with <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxi-p25.4"></span>τοὺς κύνας καλῶμεν</span>:
“by holding our peace let us call the dogs,” etc.

<span id="vi.xxxi-p26"></span> In the original the sense is perplexed by
the negligent use of the demonstr. <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxi-p26.1"></span>οὗτος</span> and <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxi-p26.2"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxi-p26.3"></span>κεῖνος</span>, *supra* p. 42. The meaning is:
“B. (the second person mentioned) says to A. (suppose a <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxi-p26.4"></span>πόρνη περιφανής</span>),
“You are so and so,” such being the fact: she retorts with a like
reproach, which is not true: whether is most damaged (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxi-p26.5"></span>ὕ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxi-p26.6"></span>βρισται</span>)? Not she,
for being what the other calls her she is just where she was before. The
disgrace is to him; and that, not from her words, for they do not fit:
but from his own indecent railing: so that he thinking to disgrace her
has more disgraced himself. He is more disgraced by calling the other
the thing that she is, than by being called by her the thing that he is
not.”

id="vi.xxxi-p27.1"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span

rightly for <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxi-p27.7"></span>ἄ</span><span class="Greek"><span

<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxi-p27.10"></span>ά</span><span

id="vi.xxxi-p27.13"></span>πιστος</span>:” which latter in the way in
which it is put *supra* Hom. xiv. p. 193: “as regards himself, he has
shown all men that he is not to be trusted, as not knowing how to screen
his neighbor’s faults.”

<span id="vi.xxxi-p28"></span> <span class="Greek"><span

*eorum qui forum frequentant:* but, “one of those old hags, bawds, and
the like, whom for their crimes you may see dragged by the officers to
punishment, and screaming out their foul-mouthed railings.”
