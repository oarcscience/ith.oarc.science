<span id="vii.xvi-p1"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vii.xvi-p1.1"></span>Homily XIV.</span>

<span id="vii.xvi-p2"></span>[Rom.
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#012.md),
[13](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#013.md)<span id="vii.xvi-p2.1"></span>

<span id="vii.xvi-p3"></span>“Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not
to the flesh, to live after the flesh. For if ye live after the flesh,
ye shall die; but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the
body, ye shall live.”

<span id="vii.xvi-p4"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="vii.xvi-p4.1"></span>After</span> showing how great the reward of a
spiritual life is, and that it maketh Christ to dwell in us, and that it
quickeneth our mortal bodies, and wingeth them to heaven, and rendereth
the way of virtue easier, he next fitly introduces an exhortation to
this purpose. “Therefore” we ought “not to live after the flesh.” But
this is not what he says, for he words it in a much more striking and
powerful way, thus, “we are debtors to the Spirit.” For saying, “we are
debtors not to the flesh,” indicates this. And this is a point he is
everywhere giving proof of, that what God hath done for us is not matter
of debt, but of mere grace. But after this, what we do is no longer
matter of free-will offering, but of debt. For when he saith, “Ye are
bought with a price, be not ye the servants of men” (<span
id="vii.xvi-p4.2"></span>[1 Cor. vii.
23](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#023)<span id="vii.xvi-p4.3"></span>.md);
and when he writes, “Ye are not your own” ([1 Cor.
6.19](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#019)<span id="vii.xvi-p4.4"></span>.md);
and again in another passage he calls these selfsame things to their
mind, in these words, “If (most <span class="c14"><span
id="vii.xvi-p4.5"></span>mss.</span> om. “if”) One died for all, then
all died <span id="fr_1414"></span>[1415](#fn_1414.md) that they should not
henceforth live unto themselves.” ([2 Cor. v.
15](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#015)<span id="vii.xvi-p5.1"></span>..md)
And it is to establish this that he says here also, “We are debtors;”
then since he said we are “not” debtors “to the flesh,” lest you should
again take him to be speaking against the nature of the flesh, he does
not leave speaking, but proceeds, “to live after the flesh.” For there
are many things which we do owe it, as giving it food, warmth, and rest,
medicine when out of health, clothing, and a thousand other attentions.
To prevent your supposing then that it is this ministration he is for
abrogating when he says, “We are not debtors to the flesh,” he explains
it by saying, “to live after the flesh.” For the care that I am for
abrogating is, he means, that which leadeth to sin, as I should be for
its having what is healing to it. And this he shows further on. For when
he says, “Make not provision for the flesh,” he does not pause at this,
but adds, “to fulfil the lusts thereof.” (<span
id="vii.xvi-p5.2"></span>[Rom. xiii.
14](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#014)<span id="vii.xvi-p5.3"></span>..md)
And this instruction he gives us here also, meaning, Let it have
attention shown it indeed, for we do owe it this, yet let us not live
according to the flesh, that is, let us not make it the mistress of our
life. For it must be the follower, not the leader, and it is not it that
must regulate our life, but the laws of the Spirit must it receive.
Having then defined this point, and having proved that we are debtors to
the Spirit, to show next for what benefits it is that we are debtors, he
does not speak of those past (a thing which serves as a most striking
proof of his judgment), but those which were to come; although even the
former were enough for the purpose. Yet still he does not set them down
in the present case, or mention even those unspeakable blessings, but
the things to come. For a benefit once for all conferred does not, for
the most part, draw men on so much as one which is expected, and is to
come. After adding this then, he first uses the pains and ills that come
of living after the flesh, to put them in fear, in the following words;
“For if ye live after the flesh ye shall die,” so intimating to us that
deathless death, punishment, and vengeance in hell. Or rather if one
were to look accurately into this, such an one is, even in this present
life, dead. And this we have made clear to you in the last discourse.
“But if ye through the Spirit, do mortify the deeds of the body, ye
shall live.” You see that it is not the essence of the body whereof we
are discoursing, but the deeds of the flesh. For he does not say, “if ye
through the Spirit do mortify” the essence “of the body,” but “the deeds
of” it, and these not all deeds, but such as are evil. And this is plain
in what follows: for if ye do this, “ye shall live,” he says. And how is
it in the nature of things for this to be, if it was all deeds that his
language applied to? for seeing and hearing and speaking and walking are
deeds of the body; and if we mortify these, we shall be so far from
living, that we shall have to suffer the punishment of a manslayer. What
sort of deeds then does he mean us to mortify? Those which tend toward
wickedness, those which go after vice, which there is no other way of
mortifying save through the Spirit. For by killing yourself you may put
an end to the others. <span id="fr_1415"></span>[1416](#fn_1415.md) And
this you have no right to do. But to these (you can put an end) by the
Spirit only. For if This be present, all the billows are laid low, and
the passions cower under It, and nothing can exalt itself against
us. <span id="fr_1416"></span>[1417](#fn_1416.md) So you see how it is on
things to come, as I said before, that he grounds his exhortations to
us, and shows that we are debtors not owing to what has been already
done only. For the advantage of the Spirit is not this only, that He
hath set us free from our former sins, but that He rendereth us
impregnable against future ones, and counts us worthy of the immortal
life. Then, to state another reward also, he proceeds:

<span id="vii.xvi-p8"></span>[Rom.
8.14](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#014.md)<span id="vii.xvi-p8.1"></span>.
“For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.”

<span id="vii.xvi-p9"></span>Now this is again a much greater honor than
the first. And this is why he does not say merely, As many as live <span
id="fr_1417"></span>[1418](#fn_1417.md) by the Spirit of God, but, “as many
as are led by the Spirit of God,” to show that he would have Him use
such power over our life as a pilot doth over a ship, or a charioteer
over a pair of horses. And it is not the body only, but the soul itself
too, that he is for setting under reins of this sort. For he would not
have even that independent, but place its authority <span
id="fr_1418"></span>[1419](#fn_1418.md) also under the power of the Spirit.
For lest through a confidence in the Gift of the Font they should turn
negligent of their conversation after it, he would say, that even
supposing you receive baptism, yet if you are not minded to be “led by
the Spirit” afterwards, you lose the dignity bestowed upon you, and the
pre-eminence of your adoption. This is why he does not say, As many as
have received the Spirit, but, “as many as are led by the Spirit,” that
is, as many as live up to this all their life long, “they are the sons
of God.” Then since this dignity was given to the Jews also, for it
says, “I said ye are Gods, and all of you children of the Most High”
(<span id="vii.xvi-p11.3"></span>[Ps. lxxxii.
6](../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#006)<span id="vii.xvi-p11.4"></span>.md);
and again, “I have nourished and brought up children” (<span
id="vii.xvi-p11.5"></span>[Is. i.
2](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#002)<span id="vii.xvi-p11.6"></span>.md);
and so, “Israel is My first-born” ([Ex. iv.
22](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#022)<span id="vii.xvi-p11.7"></span>.md);
and Paul too says, “Whose is the adoption” ([Rom. ix.
4](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#004)<span id="vii.xvi-p11.8"></span>.md)—he
next asserts the great difference between the latter and the former
honor. For though the names are the same, he means, still, the things
are not the same. And of these points he gives a clear demonstration, by
introducing a comparison drawn both from the persons so advanced (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.xvi-p11.9"></span>κατορθούντων</span>) and
from what was given them, and from what was to come. And first he shows
what they of old had given them. What then was this? “A spirit of
bondage:” and so he thus proceeds,

<span id="vii.xvi-p12"></span>[Rom.
8.15](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#015.md)<span id="vii.xvi-p12.1"></span>.
“For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear.”

<span id="vii.xvi-p13"></span>Then not staying to mention that which
stands in contradistinction to bondage, that is, the spirit of freedom,
he has named what is far greater, that of adoption, through which he at
the same time brings in the other, saying, “But ye have received the
Spirit of adoption.”

<span id="vii.xvi-p14"></span>But this is plain. But what the spirit of
bondage may be, is not so plain, and there is need of making it clearer.
Now what he says is so far from being clear, that it is in fact very
perplexing. For the people of the Jews did not receive the Spirit. What
then is his meaning here? It is the letter he giveth this name to, for
spiritual it was, and so he called the Law spiritual also, and the water
from the Rock, and the Manna. “For they did eat,” he says, “of the same
spiritual meat, and all drank of the same spiritual drink.” (<span
id="vii.xvi-p14.1"></span>[1 Cor.
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#003.md),
[4](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#004)<span id="vii.xvi-p14.2"></span>..md)
And to the Rock he gives this name, when he says, “For they drank of
that spiritual Rock which followed them.” Now it is because all the
rites then wrought were above nature that he calls them spiritual, and
not because those who then partook of them received the Spirit. And in
what sense were those letters, letters of bondage? Set before yourself
the whole dispensation, and then you will have a clear view of this
also. For recompenses were with them close at hand, and the reward
followed forthwith, being at once proportionate, and like a kind of
daily ration given to domestic servants, and terrors in abundance came
to their height before their eyes, and their purifications concerned
their bodies, and their continency extended but to their actions. But
with us it is not so, since the imagination even and the conscience
getteth purged out. For He does not say, “Thou shalt do no murder,”
only, but even thou shalt not be angry: so too, it is not, “Thou shalt
not commit adultery,” but thou shalt not look unchastely. So that it is
not to be from fear of present punishment, but out of desire towards
Himself, that both our being habitually virtuous, and all our single
good deeds are to come. Neither doth he promise a land flowing with milk
and honey, but maketh us joint-heir with the Only-Begotten, so making us
by every means stand aloof from things present, and promising to give
such things especially as are worth the acceptance of men made sons of
God, nothing, that is, of a sensible kind or corporeal, but spiritual
all of them. And so they, even if they had the name of sons, were but as
slaves; but we as having been made free, have received the adoption, and
are waiting for Heaven. And with them He discoursed through the
intervention of others, with us by Himself. And all that they did was
through the impulse of fear, but the spiritual act through a coveting
and a vehement desire. And this they show by the fact of their <span
id="fr_1419"></span>[1420](#fn_1419.md) overstepping the commandments.
They, as hirelings and obstinate persons, so never left murmuring: but
these do all for the pleasing of the Father. So too they blasphemed when
they had benefits done them: but we are thankful at being jeoparded. And
if there be need of punishing both of us upon our sinning, even in this
case the difference is great. For it is not on being stoned and branded
and maimed by the priests, as they were, that we are brought round. But
it is enough for us to be cast out from our Father’s table, and to be
out of sight for certain days. And with the Jews the honor of adoption
was one of name only, but here the reality followed also, the cleansing
of Baptism, the giving of the Spirit, the furnishing of the other
blessings. And there are several other points besides, which go to show
our high birth and their low condition. After intimating all these then
by speaking of the Spirit, and fear, and the adoption, he gives a fresh
proof again of having the Spirit of adoption. Now what is this? That “we
cry, Abba, Father.” And how great this is, the initiated know (St. Cyr.
Jer. Cat. 23, §11, p. 276, O.T.), being with good reason bidden to use
this word first in the Prayer of the initiated. What then, it may be
said, did not they also call God Father? Dost thou not hear Moses, when
he says, “Thou desertedst the God that begot thee?” (<span
id="vii.xvi-p15.5"></span>[Deut. xxxii.
15](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#015.md)<span id="vii.xvi-p15.6"></span>.
LXX.) Dost thou not hear Malachi reproaching them, and saying, that “one
God formed you,” and there is “one Father of you all?” (<span
id="vii.xvi-p15.7"></span>[Mal. ii.
10](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#010.md)<span id="vii.xvi-p15.8"></span>.
LXX.) Still, if these words and others besides are used, we do not find
them anywhere calling God by the name, or praying in this language. But
we all, priests and laymen, rulers and ruled, are ordered to pray
herein. And this is the first language we give utterance to, after those
marvellous throes, and that strange and unusual mode of labor. If in any
other instances they so called Him, that was only of their own mind. But
those in the state of grace do it through being moved by the in-working
of the Spirit. For as there is a Spirit of Wisdom, after which they that
were unwise became wise, and this discloses itself in their teaching:
and a Spirit of Power there is, whereby the feeble raised up the dead,
and drove out devils; a Spirit also of the gift of healing, and a Spirit
of prophecy, and a Spirit of tongues, so also a Spirit of adoption. And
as we know the Spirit of prophecy, in that he who hath it foretelleth
things to come, not speaking of his own mind, but moved by the Grace; so
too is the Spirit of adoption, whereby he that is gifted with it calleth
God, Father, as moved by the Spirit. Wishing to express this as a most
true descent, he used also the Hebrew <span
id="fr_1420"></span>[1421](#fn_1420.md) tongue, for he does not say only,
“Father,” but “Abba, Father,” which name is a special sign of true-born
children to their fathers. After mentioning then the diversity resulting
from their conversation, that resulting from the grace which had been
given, and that from their freedom, he brings forward another
demonstration of the superiority which goes with this adoption. Now of
what kind is this?

<span id="vii.xvi-p17"></span>[Rom.
8.16](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#016.md)<span id="vii.xvi-p17.1"></span>.
“The Spirit Itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the
children of God.”

<span id="vii.xvi-p18"></span>For it is not from the language merely, he
says, that I make my assertion, but from the cause out of which the
language has its birth; since it is from the Spirit suggesting it that
we so speak. And this in another passage he has put into plainer words,
thus: “God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into our hearts,
crying, Abba Father.” ([Gal. iv.
6](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#006)<span id="vii.xvi-p18.1"></span>..md)
And what is that, “Spirit beareth witness with spirit?” The Comforter,
he means, with that Gift, which is given unto us. For it is not of the
Gift alone that it is the voice, but of the Comforter also who gave the
Gift, He Himself having taught us through the Gift so to speak. But when
the “Spirit beareth witness” what farther place for doubtfulness? For if
it were a man, or angel, or archangel, or any other such power that
promised this, then there might be reason in some doubting. But when it
is the Highest Essence that bestoweth this Gift, and “beareth witness”
by the very words He bade us use in prayer, who would doubt any more of
our dignity? For not even when the Emperor elects any one, and proclaims
in all men’s hearing the honor done him, does anybody venture to
gainsay.

<span id="vii.xvi-p19"></span>[Rom.
8.17](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#017.md)<span id="vii.xvi-p19.1"></span>.
“And if children, then heirs.”

<span id="vii.xvi-p20"></span>Observe how he enhances the Gift by little
and little. For since it is a possible case to be children, and yet not
become heirs (for it is not by any means all children that are heirs),
he adds this besides—that we are heirs. But the Jews, besides their not
having the same adoption as we, were also cast out from the inheritance.
For “He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and will let out the
vineyard to other husbandmen” ([Matt. xxi.
41](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#041)<span id="vii.xvi-p20.1"></span>.md):
and before this, He said that “many shall come from the East and from
the West, and shall sit down with Abraham, but the children of the
Kingdom shall be cast out.” ([Matt.
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#011.md),
[12](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#012)<span id="vii.xvi-p20.2"></span>..md)
But even here he does not pause, but sets down something even greater
than this. What may this be then? That we are heirs of God; and so he
adds, “heirs of God.” And what is more still, that we are not simply
heirs, but also “joints heirs with Christ.” Observe how ambitious he is
of bringing us near to the Master. For since it is not all children that
are heirs, he shows that we are both children and heirs; next, as it is
not all heirs that are heirs to any great amount, he shows that we have
this point with us too, as we are heirs of God. Again, since it were
possible to be God’s heir, but in no sense “joint heir with” the
Only-Begotten, he shows that we have this also. And consider his wisdom.
For after throwing the distasteful part into a short compass, when he
was saying what was to become of such as “live after the flesh,” for
instance, that they “shall die,” when he comes to the more soothing
part, he leadeth forth his discourse into a large room, and so expands
it on the recompense of rewards, and in pointing out that the gifts too
are manifold and great. For if even the being a child were a grace
unspeakable, just think how great a thing it is to be heir! But if this
be great, much more is it to be “joint heir.” Then to show that the Gift
is not of grace only, and to give at the same time a credibility to what
he says, he proceeds, “If so be that we suffer with Him, that we may be
also glorified together.” If, he would say, we be sharers with Him in
what is painful, much more shall it be so in what is good. For He who
bestowed such blessings upon those who had wrought no good, how, when He
seeth them laboring and suffering so much, shall he do else than give
them greater requital? Having then shown that the thing was a matter of
return, to make men give credit to what was said, and prevent any from
doubting, he shows further that it has the virtue of a gift. The one he
showed, that what was said might gain credit even with those that
doubted, and that the receivers of it might not feel ashamed as being
evermore receiving salvation for nought; and the other, that you might
see that God outdoeth the toils by His recompenses. And the one he has
shown in the words, “If so be that we suffer with Him, that we may be
also glorified together.” But the other in proceeding to add;

<span id="vii.xvi-p21"></span>[Rom.
8.18](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#018.md)<span id="vii.xvi-p21.1"></span>.
“The sufferings of the present time are not worthy to be compared with
the glory which shall be revealed in (Gr. <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xvi-p21.2"></span>εἰς</span>) us.”

<span id="vii.xvi-p22"></span>In what went before, he requires of the
spiritual man the correcting of his habits (Mar. and 6 <span
class="c14"><span id="vii.xvi-p22.1"></span>mss.</span> passions), where
he says, “Ye are not debtors to live after the flesh,” that such an one,
for instance, should be above lust, anger, money, vainglory, grudging.
But here having reminded them of the whole gift, both as given and as to
come, and raised him up aloft with hopes, and placed him near to Christ,
and showed him to be a joint-heir of the Only-Begotten; he now leads him
forth with confidence even to dangers. For to get the better of the evil
affections in us, is not the same thing with bearing up under those
trials, scourges, famine, plunderings, bonds, chains, executions. For
these last required much more of a noble and vigorous spirit. And
observe how he at once allays and rouses the spirit of the combatants.
For after he had shown that the rewards were greater than the labors, he
both exhorts to greater efforts, and yet will not let them be elated, as
being still outdone by the crowns given in requital. And in another
passage he says, “For our light affliction, which is but for a moment,
worketh a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory” (<span
id="vii.xvi-p22.2"></span>[2 Cor. iv.
17](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#017)<span id="vii.xvi-p22.3"></span>.md):
it being the deeper sort of persons he was then speaking to. Here,
however, he does not allow that the afflictions were light; but still he
mingles comfort with them by the compensation which good things to come
afford, in the words, “For I reckon that the sufferings of this present
time are not worthy to be compared,” and he does not say, with the rest
(<span class="Greek"><span id="vii.xvi-p22.4"></span>ἄ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.xvi-p22.5"></span>νεσιν</span>) that is to
come, but what is much greater, “with the glory which is to come.” For
it does not follow, that where rest is there is glory; but that where
glory is there is rest, does follow: then as he had said that it is to
come, he shows that it already is. For he does not say, that which is to
be, but “which shall be revealed in us,” as if already existing but
unrevealed. As also in another place he said in clearer words, “Our life
is hid with Christ in God.” <span id="fr_1421"></span>[1422](#fn_1421.md)
Be then of a good heart about it. For already hath it been prepared, and
awaiteth thy labors. But if it vexes you that it is yet to come, rather
let this very thing rejoice you. For it is owing to its being great and
unutterable, and transcending our present condition, that it is stored
up there. And so he has not put barely “the sufferings of this present
time,” but he speaks so as to show that it is not in quality only, but
in quantity also, that the other life has the advantage. For these
sufferings, whatever they are, are attached to our present life; but the
blessings to come reach themselves out over ages without end. And since
he had no way of giving a particular description of these, or of putting
them before us in language, he gives them a name from what seems to be
specially an object of desire with us, “glory.” For the summit of
blessings and the sum of them, this seems to be. And to urge the hearer
on in another way also, he gives a loftiness to his discourse by the
mention of the creation, gaining two points by what he is next saying,
the contempt of things present, and the desire of things to come, and a
third beside these, or rather the first, is the showing how the human
race is cared for on God’s part and in what honor He holds our nature.
And besides this, all the doctrines of the philosophers, which they had
framed for themselves about this world, as a sort of cobweb or child’s
mound, <span id="fr_1422"></span>[1423](#fn_1422.md) he throws down with
this one doctrine. But that these things may stand in a clearer light,
let us hear the Apostle’s own language.

<span id="vii.xvi-p25"></span>[Rom.
8:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#019.md),
[20](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#020.md)<span id="vii.xvi-p25.1"></span>.
“For the earnest expectation of the creation waiteth,” he says, “for the
revelation of the sons of God. For the creation was made subject to
vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same
in hope.”

<span id="vii.xvi-p26"></span>And the meaning is something of this kind.
The creation itself is in the midst of its pangs, waiting for and
expecting these good things whereof we have just now spoken. For
“earnest expectation” (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xvi-p26.1"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xvi-p26.2"></span>ποκαραδοκία</span>, looking out) implies
expecting intensely. And so his discourse becomes more emphatic, and he
personifies this whole world as the prophets also do, when they
introduce the floods clapping their hands, and little hills leaping, and
mountains skipping, not that we are to fancy them alive, or ascribe any
reasoning power to them, but that we may learn the greatness of the
blessings, so great as to reach even to things without sense also. <span
id="fr_1423"></span>[1424](#fn_1423.md) The very same thing they do many
times also in the case of afflicting things, since they bring in the
vine lamenting, and the wine too, and the mountains, and the
boardings <span id="fr_1424"></span>[1425](#fn_1424.md) of the Temple
howling, and in this case too it is that we may understand the extremity
of the evils. It is then in imitation of these that the Apostle makes a
living person of the creature here, and says that it groaneth and
travaileth: not that he heard any groan conveyed from the earth and
heaven to him, but that he might show the exceeding greatness of the
good things to come; and the desire of freedom from the ills which now
pervaded them. “For the creature was made subject to vanity, not
willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same.” What is
the meaning of, “the creation was made subject to vanity?” Why that it
became corruptible. For what cause, and on what account? On account of
thee, O man. For since thou hast taken a body mortal and liable to
suffering, the earth too hath received a curse, and brought forth thorns
and thistles. But that the heaven, when it is waxen old along with the
earth, is to change afterwards to a better portion (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.xvi-p28.5"></span>λἥξιν</span> v. p. 384)
hear from the Prophet in his words; “Thou, O Lord, from the beginning
hast founded the earth, and the heavens are the work of Thy hands. They
shall perish, but thou shalt endure; and they all shall wax old as doth
a garment, and as a cloak shalt Thou fold them up, and they shall be
changed.” (<span id="vii.xvi-p28.6"></span>[Ps.
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#025.md),
[26](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#026)<span id="vii.xvi-p28.7"></span>..md)
Isaiah too declares the same, when he says, “Look to the heaven above,
and upon the earth beneath, for the heavens are as a firmament of
smoke, <span id="fr_1425"></span>[1426](#fn_1425.md) and the earth shall
wax old like a garment, and they that dwell therein shall perish in like
manner.” (<span id="vii.xvi-p29.6"></span>[Is. li.
6](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#006)<span id="vii.xvi-p29.7"></span>..md).
Now you see in what sense the creation is “in bondage to vanity,” and
how it is to be freed from the ruined state. For the one says, “Thou
shalt fold them up as a garment, and they shall be changed;” and Isaiah
says, “and they that dwell therein shall perish in like manner,” not of
course meaning an utter perishing. For neither do they that dwell
therein, mankind, that is, undergo such an one, but a temporary one, and
through it they are changed into an incorruptible (<span
id="vii.xvi-p29.8"></span>[1 Cor. xv.
53](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#053)<span id="vii.xvi-p29.9"></span>.md)
state, and so therefore will the creature be. And all this he showed by
the way, by his saying “in like manner” (<span
id="vii.xvi-p29.10"></span>[2 Pet. iii.
13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#013)<span id="vii.xvi-p29.11"></span>.md),
which Paul also says farther on. At present, however, he speaks about
the bondage itself, and shows for what reason it became such, and gives
ourselves as the cause of it. What then? Was it harshly treated on
another’s account? By no means, for it was on my account that it was
made. What wrong then is done it, which was made for my sake, when it
suffereth these things for my correction? Or, indeed, one has no need to
moot the question of right and wrong at all in the case of things void
of soul and feeling. But Paul, since he had made it a living person,
makes use of none of these topics I have mentioned, but another kind of
language, as desiring to comfort the hearer with the utmost advantage.
And of what kind is this? What have you to say? he means. It was evil
intreated for thy sake, and became corruptible; yet it has had no wrong
done it. For incorruptible will it be for thy sake again. This then is
the meaning of “in hope.” But when he says, it was “not willingly” that
it was made subject, it is not to show that it is possessed of judgment
that he says so, but that you may learn that the whole is brought about
by Christ’s care, and this is no achievement of its own. And now say in
what hope?

<span id="vii.xvi-p30"></span>[Rom.
8.21](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#021.md)<span id="vii.xvi-p30.1"></span>.
“That the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of
corruption.”

<span id="vii.xvi-p31"></span>Now what is this creation? Not thyself
alone, but that also which is thy inferior, and partaketh not of reason
or sense, this too shall be a sharer in thy blessings. For “it shall be
freed,” he says, “from the bondage of corruption,” that is, it shall no
longer be corruptible, but shall go along with the beauty given to thy
body; just as when this became corruptible, that became corruptible
also; so now it is made incorruptible, that also shall follow it too.
And to show this he proceeds. (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xvi-p31.1"></span>εἰς</span>) “Into the glorious liberty of the
children of God.” That is, because of <span
id="fr_1426"></span>[1427](#fn_1426.md) their liberty. For as a nurse who
is bringing up a king’s child, when he has come to his father’s power,
does herself enjoy the good things along with him, thus also is the
creation, he means. You see how in all respects man takes the lead, and
that it is for his sake that all things are made. See how he solaces the
struggler, and shows the unspeakable love of God toward man. For why, he
would say, dost thou fret at thy temptations? thou art suffering for
thyself, the creation for thee. Nor does he solace only, but also shows
what he says to be trustworthy. For if the creation which was made
entirely for thee is “in hope,” much more oughtest thou to be, through
whom the creation is to come to the enjoyment of those good things. Thus
men (3 <span class="c14"><span id="vii.xvi-p32.2"></span>mss.</span>
fathers) also when a son is to appear at his coming to a dignity, clothe
even the servants with a brighter garment, to the glory of the son; so
will God also clothe the creature with incorruption for the glorious
liberty of the children.

<span id="vii.xvi-p33"></span>[Rom.
8.22](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#022.md)<span id="vii.xvi-p33.1"></span>.
“For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain
together until now.”

<span id="vii.xvi-p34"></span>Observe, how he shames the hearer, saying
almost, Be not thou worse than the creation, neither find a pleasure in
resting in things present. Not only ought we not to cling to them, but
even to groan over the delay of our departure hence. For if the creation
doth this, much more oughtest thou to do so, honored with reason as thou
art. But as this was not yet enough to force their attention, he
proceeds.

<span id="vii.xvi-p35"></span>[Rom.
8.23](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#023.md)<span id="vii.xvi-p35.1"></span>.
“And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the first-fruits of
the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves.”

<span id="vii.xvi-p36"></span>That is, having had a taste of the things
to come. For even if any should be quite stone hard, he means what has
been given already is enough to raise him up, and draw him off from
things present, and to wing him after things to come in two ways, both
by the greatness of the things that are given, and by the fact that,
great and numerous as they are, they are but first-fruits. For if the
first-fruits be so great that we are thereby freed even from our sins,
and attain to righteousness and sanctification, and that those of that
time both drave out devils, and raised the dead by their shadow ([Acts
v. 15](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#015.md)<span
id="vii.xvi-p36.1"></span>), or garments ([Acts
19.12](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#012.md)<span
id="vii.xvi-p36.2"></span>), consider how great the whole must be. And
if the creation, devoid as it is of mind and reason, and though in
ignorance of these things, yet groaneth, much more should we. Next, that
he may give the heretics no handle, or seem to be disparaging our
present world, we groan, he says, not as finding fault with the present
system, but through a desire of those greater things. And this he shows
in the words, “Waiting for the adoption.” What dost thou say, let me
hear? Thou didst insist on it at every turn, and didst cry aloud, that
we were already made sons, and now dost thou place this good thing among
hopes, writing that we must needs wait for it? Now it is to set this
right by the sequel that he says, “to wit, the redemption <span
id="fr_1427"></span>[1428](#fn_1427.md) of our body.” That is, the perfect
glory. Our lot indeed is at present uncertainty to our last breath,
since many of us that were sons have become dogs and prisoners. But if
we decease with a good hope, then is the gift unmovable, and clearer,
and greater, having no longer any change to fear from death and sin.
Then therefore will the grace be secure, when our body shall be freed
from death and its countless ailments (or passions). For this is full
redemption (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xvi-p37.4"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xvi-p37.5"></span>πολύτρωσις</span>), not a redemption <span
id="fr_1428"></span>[1429](#fn_1428.md) only, but such, that we shall never
again return to our former captivity. For that thou mayest not be
perplexed at hearing so much of glory without getting any distinct
knowledge of it, he partially exposes to thy view the things to come,
setting before thee the change of thy body (Gr. changing thy body), and
along with it the change of the whole creation. And this he has put in a
clearer light in another passage, where he says, “Who shall change our
vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto His glorious Body.”
([Phil. iii. 21](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#021.md)<span
id="vii.xvi-p38.2"></span>.) And in another place again he writes and
says, “But when this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be
brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in
victory.” ([1 Cor. xv. 54](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#054.md)<span
id="vii.xvi-p38.3"></span>.) But to show, that with the corruption of
the body the constitution of the things of this life will also come to
an end, he wrote again elsewhere, “For the fashion of this world passeth
away.” (<span id="vii.xvi-p38.4"></span>[1 Cor. vii.
31](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#031)<span id="vii.xvi-p38.5"></span>..md)

<span id="vii.xvi-p39"></span>[Rom.
8.24](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#024.md)<span id="vii.xvi-p39.1"></span>.
“For we are saved by hope,” he says.

<span id="vii.xvi-p40"></span>Now since he had dwelt upon the promise of
the things to come, and this seemed to pain the weaker hearer, if the
blessings are all matter of hope; after proving before that they are
surer than things present and visible, and discoursing at large on the
gifts already given, and showing that we have received the first fruits
of those good things, lest we should seek our all in this world, and be
traitors to the nobility that faith gives us, he says, “For we are (Gr.
were) saved by hope.” And this is about what he means. We are not to
seek our all in this life, but to have hope also. For this is the only
gift that we brought in to God, believing Him in what He promised shall
come, and it was by this way alone we were saved. If then we lose this
hope, we have lost all that was of our own contributing. For I put you
this question, he would say, Wert thou not liable for countless sins?
wert thou not in despair? wert thou not under sentence? were not all out
of heart about thy salvation? What then saved thee? It was thy
hoping <span id="fr_1429"></span>[1430](#fn_1429.md) in God alone, and
trusting to Him about His promises and gifts, and nothing besides hadst
thou to bring in. If it was this then that saved thee, hold it fast now
also. For that which afforded thee so great blessings, to a certainty
will not deceive thee in regard to things to come. For in that it found
thee dead, and ruined, and a prisoner, and an enemy, and yet made thee a
friend, and a son, and a freeman, and righteous, and a joint-heir, and
yielded such great things as no one ever expected even, how, after such
munificence and attachment, will it betray <span
id="fr_1430"></span>[1431](#fn_1430.md) thee in what is to follow? Say not
to me, hopes again! expectations again! faith again! For it is in this
way thou wert saved from the beginning, and this dowry was the only one
that thou didst bring in to the Bridegroom. Hold it then fast and keep
it: for if thou demandest to have everything in this world, thou hast
lost that well-doing of thine, through which thou didst become bright,
and this is why he proceeds to say, “But hope that is seen is not hope;
for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?”

<span id="vii.xvi-p43"></span>[Rom.
8.25](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#025.md)<span
id="vii.xvi-p43.1"></span>.—“But if we hope for that we see not, then do
we with patience wait for it.”

<span id="vii.xvi-p44"></span>That is, if thou art to be looking for
everything in this world, what need is there for hope? What is hope
then? It is feeling confidence in things to come. What great demand then
doth God make upon thee, since He Himself giveth thee blessings quite
entire from His own stores? One thing only, hope, He asks of thee, that
thou too mayest have somewhat of thine own to contribute toward thy
salvation. And this he intimates in what he proceeds with: “For if we
hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.” As then
God crowneth him that undergoes labors, and hardnesses, and countless
toils, so doth He him that hopeth. For the name of patience belongs to
hard work and much endurance. Yet even this He hath granted to the man
that hopeth, that He might solace the wearied soul. And then to show
that for this light task we enjoy abundant aid, he proceeds:

<span id="vii.xvi-p45"></span>[Rom.
8.26](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#026.md)<span id="vii.xvi-p45.1"></span>.
“Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities.” <span
id="fr_1431"></span>[1432](#fn_1431.md)

<span id="vii.xvi-p47"></span>For the one point is thy own, that of
patience, but the other comes of the Spirit’s furnishings, Who also
cherisheth (Gr. anointeth) thee unto this hope, and through it again
lighteneth thy labors. Then that thou mightest know that it is not in
thy labors only and dangers that this grace standeth by thee, but even
in things the most easy seemingly, <span
id="fr_1432"></span>[1433](#fn_1432.md) it worketh with thee, and on all
occasions bears its part in the alliance, he proceeds to say,

<span id="vii.xvi-p49"></span>“For we know not what we should pray for
as we ought.”

<span id="vii.xvi-p50"></span>And this he said to show the Spirit’s
great concern about us, and also to instruct them not to think for
certainty that those things are desirable which to man’s reasonings
appear so. For since it was likely that they, when they were scourged,
and driven out, and suffering grievances without number, should be
seeking a respite, and ask this favor of God, and think it was
advantageous to them, by no means (he says) suppose that what seem
blessings to you really are so. For we need the Spirit’s aid even to do
this. So feeble is man, and such a nothing by himself. For this is why
he says, “For we know not what we should pray for as we ought.” In order
that the learner might not feel any shame at his ignorance, he does not
say, ye know not, but, “we know not.” And that he did not say this
merely to seem moderate, he plainly shows from other passages. For he
desired in his prayers unceasingly to see Rome. Yet the time when he
obtained it was not at once when he desired it. And for “the thorn” that
was given him “in the flesh” (<span id="vii.xvi-p50.1"></span>[2 Cor.
xii. 8](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#008.md)<span
id="vii.xvi-p50.2"></span>), that is the dangers, he often besought God,
and was entirely unsuccessful. <span
id="fr_1433"></span>[1434](#fn_1433.md) And so was Moses, who in the Old
Testament prays to see Palestine (<span id="vii.xvi-p51.1"></span>[Deut.
iii. 26](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#026.md)<span
id="vii.xvi-p51.2"></span>), and Jeremiah when he made supplication for
the Jews (<span id="vii.xvi-p51.3"></span>[Jer. xv.
1](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#001)<span id="vii.xvi-p51.4"></span>.md),
and Abraham when he interceded for the people of Sodom. “But the Spirit
Itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be
uttered.” This statement is not clear, owing to the cessation of many of
the wonders which then used to take place. Wherefore I must needs inform
you of the state of things at that time, and in this way the rest of the
subject will be cleared. What therefore was the state of things then?
God did in those days give to all that were baptized certain excellent
gifts, and the name that these had was spirits. For “the spirits of the
Prophets,” it says, “are subject to the prophets.” (<span
id="vii.xvi-p51.5"></span>[1 Cor. xiv.
32](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#032)<span id="vii.xvi-p51.6"></span>..md)
And one had the gift of prophecy and foretold things to come; and
another of wisdom, and taught the many; and another of healings, and
cured the sick; and another of miracles, and raised the dead; another of
tongues, and spoke different languages. And with all these there was
also a gift of prayer, which also was called a spirit, and he that had
this prayed for all the people. For since we are ignorant of much that
is profitable for us and ask things that are not profitable, the gift of
prayer came into some particular person of that day, and what was
profitable for all the whole Church alike, he was the appointed person
to ask for in behalf of all, and the instructor of the rest. Spirit then
is the name that he gives here to the grace of this character, and the
soul that receiveth the grace, and intercedeth to God, and groaneth. For
he that was counted worthy of such grace as this, standing with much
compunction, and with many mental groanings falling before God, asked
the things that were profitable for all. And of this the Deacon of the
present day is a symbol when he offers up the prayers for the people.
This then is what Paul means when he says, <span
id="fr_1434"></span>[1435](#fn_1434.md) “the Spirit itself maketh
intercession for us with groanings that cannot be uttered.”

<span id="vii.xvi-p53"></span>[Rom.
8.27](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#027.md)<span id="vii.xvi-p53.1"></span>.
“But He that searcheth the hearts.”

<span id="vii.xvi-p54"></span>You see that it is not about the Comforter
that he is speaking, but about the spiritual heart. Since if this were
not so, he ought to have said, “He that searcheth” the Spirit. But that
thou mayest learn that the language is meant of a spiritual man, who has
the gift of prayer, he proceeds, “And he that searcheth the hearts
knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit,” that is, of the spiritual man.

<span id="vii.xvi-p55"></span>“Because he maketh intercession for the
saints according to the will of God.”

<span id="vii.xvi-p56"></span>Not (he means) that he informs God as if
ignorant, but this is done that we may learn to pray for proper things,
and to ask of God what is pleasing to Him. For this is what the
“according to God” is. And so this was with a view to solace those that
came to Him, and to yield them excellent instruction. For He that
furnished the gifts, and gave besides blessings without number, was the
Comforter. Hence it says, “all these things worketh one and the
self-same Spirit.” (<span id="vii.xvi-p56.1"></span>[1 Cor. xii.
11](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#011)<span id="vii.xvi-p56.2"></span>..md)
And it is for our instruction that this takes place, and to show the
love of the Spirit, it condescendeth even to this. And it is from this
that the person praying getteth heard, because the prayer is made
“according to the will of God.”

<span id="vii.xvi-p57"></span>You see from how many points he instructs
them in the love that was shown them and the honor that was done them.
And what is there that God hath not done for us? The world He hath made
corruptible for us, and again for us incorruptible. He suffered His
Prophets to be ill-treated for our sake, sent them into captivity for
us, let them fall into the furnace, and undergo ills without number.
Nay, He made them prophets for us, and the Apostles also He made for us.
He gave up for us His Only-Begotten, He punisheth the devil for us, He
hath seated us on the Right Hand, He was reproached for us. “For the
reproaches of them that reproached thee,” it says, “fell upon me.” ([Ps.
lxix. 9](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#009.md)<span
id="vii.xvi-p57.1"></span>.) Yet still, when we are drawing back after
so great favor, He leaveth us not, but again entreats, and on our
account inciteth others to entreat for us, that He may show us favor.
And so it was with Moses. For to him He says, “Let Me alone, that I may
blot them out” (<span id="vii.xvi-p57.2"></span>[Ex. xxxii.
10](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#010)<span id="vii.xvi-p57.3"></span>.md),
that He might drive him upon supplicating on their behalf. And now He
doth the same thing. Hence He gave the gift of prayer. But this He doth,
not as Himself standing in need of entreaty, but that we might <span
id="fr_1435"></span>[1436](#fn_1435.md) not, from being saved without
effort (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xvi-p58.3"></span>ἁ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xvi-p58.4"></span>πλὥς</span>), grow indifferent. For this cause
it is on account of David, and of this person and that, He often says,
that He is reconciled with them, to establish again this very thing,
that the reconciliation may be with all due formality. <span
id="fr_1436"></span>[1437](#fn_1436.md) Still He would have looked more
loving toward man, if it had not been through this and the other
prophet, but of Himself, that He told them that He ceased to be wroth.
But the reason of His not holding to that point was, that this ground of
reconciliation might not become an occasion for listlessness. Wherefore
to Jeremiah also He said, “Pray not for this people, for I will not hear
thee” ([Jer. xi. 14](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#014.md)<span
id="vii.xvi-p59.2"></span>), not as wishing to stop his praying (for He
earnestly longeth for our salvation), but to terrify them: and this the
prophet also seeing did not cease praying. And that you may see that it
was not through a wish to turn him from it, but to shame <span
id="fr_1437"></span>[1438](#fn_1437.md) them that He said this, hear what
it says. “Seest thou not what these are doing?” (<span
id="vii.xvi-p60.3"></span>[Ez. viii.
6](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#006.md)<span id="vii.xvi-p60.4"></span>, not
verbally from LXX.) And when He says to the city “Though thou wash thee
with nitre, and take thee much soap (Gr. herb), yet thou art stained
before Me” ([Jer. ii. 22](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#022.md)<span
id="vii.xvi-p60.5"></span>), it is not that He may cast them into
despair that He so speaks, but that He may rouse them to repentance. For
as in the case of the Ninevites, by giving the sentence without
limitation, and holding out no good hope, He scared them the more, and
led them to repentance, so He doth here also, both to rouse them, and to
render the prophet more venerated, that in this way at least they may
hear him. Then, since they kept on in a state of incurable madness, and
were not to be sobered even by the rest being carried away, he first
exhorts them to remain there. But when they kept not up to this, but
deserted to Egypt, this indeed He allowed them, but requires of them not
to desert to irreligion as well as to Egypt. ([Jer. xliv.
8](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#008)<span id="vii.xvi-p60.6"></span>..md)
But when they did not comply in this either, He sendeth the prophet
along with them, so that they might not after all suffer total wreck.
([Jer. 44.28](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#028.md)<span
id="vii.xvi-p60.7"></span>.) For since they did not follow Him when He
called, He next followeth them to discipline them, and hinder their
being hurried further into vice, and as a father full of affection does
a child who takes all treatment in the same peevish way, conducting him
about everywhere with himself, and following him about. This was the
reason why He sent not Jeremiah only into Egypt, but also Ezekiel into
Babylon, and they did not refuse to go. For when they found their Master
love the people exceedingly, they continued themselves to do so
likewise. Much as if a right-minded servant were to take compassion upon
an intractable son when he saw his father grieving and lamenting about
him. And what was there that they did not suffer for them? They were
sawn asunder, they were driven out, they were reproached, they were
stoned, they underwent numberless grievances. And after all this they
would run back to them. Samuel, for instance, ceased not to mourn for
Saul, miserably insulted as he was by him, and injured irreparably. ([1
Sam. xv. 35](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#035.md)<span
id="vii.xvi-p60.8"></span>.) Still he held none of these things in
remembrance. And for the people of the Jews, Jeremiah has composed
Lamentations in writing. And when the general of the Persians had given
him liberty to dwell securely, and with perfect freedom, wherever he
pleased, he preferred above dwelling at home the affliction of the
people, and their hard durance in a strange land. (<span
id="vii.xvi-p60.9"></span>[Jer. xi.
5](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#005)<span id="vii.xvi-p60.10"></span>..md)
So Moses left the palace and the sort of living herein, and hasted to be
among their calamities. And Daniel abode for twenty days following
without food, pinching himself with the most severe fast, that he might
reconcile God to them. ([Dan. x.
2](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#002)<span id="vii.xvi-p60.11"></span>..md)
And the three Children too, when in the furnace, and so fierce a fire,
put up a supplication for them. For it was not on their account that
they were grieved, as they were saved; but since they considered that
then was the time for the greatest boldness of speech, they consequently
prayed in their behalf; hence too they said, “In a contrite heart and an
humble spirit let us be accepted.” (<span
id="vii.xvi-p60.12"></span>Song. ver. 16.) For them Joshua also rent his
garments. ([Josh. vii. 6](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#006.md)<span
id="vii.xvi-p60.13"></span>.) For them Ezekiel too wailed and lamented
when he saw them cut down. (<span id="vii.xvi-p60.14"></span>[Ez. ix.
8](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#008)<span id="vii.xvi-p60.15"></span>..md)
And Jeremy <span id="fr_1438"></span>[1439](#fn_1438.md) said, “Let me
alone, I will weep bitterly.” ([Is. xxii.
4](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#004)<span id="vii.xvi-p61.2"></span>..md)
And before this, when he did not venture openly to pray for a remittance
of their sad estate, he sought for some limited period, when he says,
“How long, O, Lord?” ([Isa. 6.11](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#011.md)<span
id="vii.xvi-p61.3"></span>.) For full of affectionateness is the whole
race of the saints. Wherefore also St. Paul saith, “Put on therefore, as
the elect saints of God, bowels of mercy, kindness, humbleness of mind.”
(<span id="vii.xvi-p61.4"></span>[Col. iii.
12](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#012)<span id="vii.xvi-p61.5"></span>..md)
You see the strict propriety of the word, and how he would have us
continually merciful. For he does not say, “show mercy” only, but put it
on, that like as our garment is always with us, so may mercy be. And he
does not say merely mercy, but “bowels of mercy,” that we may imitate
the natural affection of relations.

<span id="vii.xvi-p62"></span>But we do just the contrary, and if any
one comes to ask a single penny of us, we insult them, abuse them, call
them impostors. Dost thou not shudder, man, and blush to call him an
impostor for bread? Why even supposing such an one is practising
imposture, he deserves to be pitied for it, because he is so pressed
with famine as to put on such a character. This then is a reproach to
our cruelty. For since we had not the heart to bestow with readiness,
they are compelled to practise a great many arts, so as to put a cheat
off upon our inhumanity, and to soften down our harshness. Now if it was
gold and silver that he asked of thee, then there would be some reason
in thy suspicions. But if it is necessary food that he comes to thee
for, why be showing thyself wise so unseasonably, and take so over exact
an account of him, accusing him of idleness and sloth? For if we must
talk in this way, it is not others but ourselves that we ought to
address. When therefore thou art going to God to ask forgiveness for thy
sins, then call these words to mind, and thou wilt know thou deservest
to have these things said to thee by God, much more than the poor man by
thee. And yet God hath never said such words to thee as “Stand off,
since thou art an impostor, always coming to church and hearing My laws,
but when abroad, setting gold, and pleasure (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xvi-p62.1"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xvi-p62.2"></span>πιθυμίαν</span>), and friendship, and in fact
anything above My commandments. And now thou makest thyself humble, but
when thy prayers are over thou art bold, and cruel, and inhuman. Get
thee hence, therefore, and never come to Me any more.” Yet this, and
more than this, we deserve to have said to us; but still He never did
reproach us in any such way, but is long-suffering and fulfils
everything on His own part, and gives us more than we ask for. Calling
this to mind then, let us relieve the poverty of those that beg of us,
and if they do impose upon us, let us not be over exact about it. For
such a salvation is it that we ourselves require, one with pardon, with
kindness (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xvi-p62.3"></span>φιλανθρωπίας</span>), with much mercy along
with it. For it is not possible, it certainly is not, if our estate were
searched into strictly, that we should ever be saved, but we must needs
be punished and brought to ruin altogether. Let us not then be bitter
judges of others lest we also get a strict account demanded of us. For
we have sins that are too great to plead any excuse. And therefore let
us show more mercy towards those who have committed inexcusable sins,
that we also may lay up for ourselves the like mercy beforehand. And yet
be as large-hearted as we may, we shall never be able to contribute such
love toward man as we stand in need of at the hand of a God that loveth
man. How then is it other than monstrous, when we are in need of so many
things ourselves, to be over exact with our fellow servants, and do all
we can against ourselves? For thou dost not in this way so much prove
him unworthy of thy liberality, as thyself of God’s love toward man. For
he that deals over exactly with his fellow servant, will be the more
sure to find the like treatment at God’s hand. Let us not speak against
ourselves, but even if they come out of idleness or wilfulness, <span
id="fr_1439"></span>[1440](#fn_1439.md) let us bestow. For we also do many
sins through wilfulness, or rather we do them all through wilfulness,
and yet God doth not presently call us to punishment, but gives us a set
time for penance, nurturing us day by day, disciplining us, teaching us,
supplying us with all other things, that we too may emulate this mercy
of His. Let us then quell this cruelty, let us cast out this brutal
spirit, as benefiting thereby ourselves rather than others. For to these
we give money, and bread, and clothing, but for ourselves we are laying
up beforehand very great glory, and such as there is no putting into
words. For we receive again our bodies incorruptible, and are <span
id="fr_1440"></span>[1441](#fn_1440.md) glorified together and reign
together with Christ. And how great this is we shall see from hence—or
rather there is no means of making us see it clearly now. But to start
from our present blessings, and to get from them at least some kind of
scanty notice of it, I will endeavor so far as I may be able to put
before you what I have been speaking of. Tell me then, if when you were
grown old, and were living in poverty, and any one were to promise
suddenly to make you young, and to bring you to the very prime of life,
and to render you very strong, and preëminently beautiful, and were to
give you the kingdom of the whole earth for a thousand years, a kingdom
in the state of the deepest peace, what is there that you would not
choose to do, and to suffer to gain this promise? (4 <span
class="c14"><span id="vii.xvi-p64.2"></span>mss.</span> and Sav. Mar.
object.) See then, Christ promises not this, but much more than this.
For the distance between old age and youth is not to be compared with
the difference of corruption and incorruption, nor that of a kingdom and
poverty to that of the present glory and the future, but the difference
is that of dreams and a reality. Or rather I have yet said nothing to
the purpose, since there is no language capable of setting before you
the greatness of the difference between things to come and things
present. And as for time, there is no place for the idea of difference.
For what mode is there for a man to compare with our present state a
life that hath no limit? And as for the peace it is as far removed from
any present peace, as peace is different from war; and for the
incorruption, it is as much better as a clear pearl is than a clod of
clay. Or rather, say as great a thing as one may, nothing can put it
before you. For were I even to compare the beauty of our bodies then to
the light of the sunbeam, or the brightest lightning, I shall not yet be
saying aught that is worthy of that brilliancy. Now for such things as
these what money so much that it were not worth the while to give up?
what bodies, or rather what souls <span
id="fr_1441"></span>[1442](#fn_1441.md) is it not worth one’s while to give
up? At present if any one were to lead thee into the palace, and in
presence of all were to give thee an opportunity of conversing with the
king, and make thee sit at his table, and join in his fare, thou
wouldest call thyself the happiest of men. But when you are to go up to
Heaven, and stand by the King of the universe Himself, and to vie with
angels in brightness, and to enjoy even that unutterable glory, do you
hesitate whether you ought to give up money? whereas if you had to put
off life itself, you ought to leap and exult, and mount on wings of
pleasure. But you, that you may get an office (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xvi-p65.1"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xvi-p65.2"></span>ρχὴν</span>), as a place to pillage from (for
call a thing of this sort gain, I cannot), put all you have to hazard,
and after borrowing of others, will, if need be, pawn your wife and
children too without hesitation.

<span id="vii.xvi-p66"></span>But when the kingdom of Heaven is set
before you, that office (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xvi-p66.1"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xvi-p66.2"></span>ρχἥς</span>) which hath none to supersede you
in it, and God bids you take not a part of a corner of the earth, but
the whole of Heaven entirely, are you hesitating, and reluctant, and
gaping after money, and forgetful that if the parts of that Heaven which
we see are so fair and delightful, how greatly so must the upper Heaven
be, and the Heaven <span id="fr_1442"></span>[1443](#fn_1442.md) of Heaven?
But since we have as yet no means of seeing this with our bodily eyes,
ascend in thy thought, and standing above this Heaven, look up unto that
Heaven beyond this, into that height without a bound, into that Light
surcharged with awe, into the crowds of the Angels, into the endless
ranks of Archangels, into the rest of the incorporeal Powers. And then
lay hold again of the image (cf. Plat. *Rep*. vii. p. 516) thereof we
have, after coming down from above, and make a sketch of the estate of a
king with us, as his men in gold armor, and his pairs of white mules
proudly decked with gold, and his chariots set with jewels <span
id="fr_1443"></span>[1444](#fn_1443.md) and his snow-like cushions (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.xvi-p68.3"></span>στρωμνὴν</span> Poll. x.
41), and the spangles that flutter about the chariot, and the dragons
shaped out in the silken hangings, and the shields with their gold
bosses, and the straps that reach up from these to the rim of them
through so many gems, and the horses with the gilded trappings and the
gold bits. But when we see the king we immediately lose sight of all
these. For he alone turns our eyes to him, and to the purple robe, and
the diadem, and the throne, and the clasp, and the shoes, all that
splendor of his appearance. After gathering all these things together
then with accuracy, then again remove your thoughts from these things to
things above, and to that awful day in which Christ is coming. For then
you will not see any pairs of mules, nor golden chariots, nor dragons
and shields, but things that are big with a mighty awe, and strike such
amazement that the very incorporeal Powers are astonished. For the
“powers of the Heavens,” He says, “shall be shaken.” ([Matt. xxiv.
29](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#029)<span id="vii.xvi-p68.4"></span>..md)
Then is the whole Heaven thrown open, and the gates of those concaves
unfold themselves, and the Only-begotten Son of God cometh down, not
with twenty, not with a hundred men for His body-guard, but with
thousands, ten thousands of Angels and Archangels, Cherubim and
Seraphim, and other Powers, and with fear and trembling shall everything
be filled, whiles the earth is bursting itself up, and the men that ever
were born, from Adam’s birth up to that day, are rising from the earth,
and all are caught up; (<span id="vii.xvi-p68.5"></span>[1 Thess. iv.
17](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#017)<span id="vii.xvi-p68.6"></span>.md)
when Himself appears with such great glory as that the sun, and the
moon, and all light whatever, is cast into the shade, being outshone by
that radiance. What language is to set before us that blessedness,
brightness, glory? Alas! my soul. For weeping comes upon me and great
groaning, as I reflect what good things we have fallen from, what
blessedness we are estranged from. For estranged we are (I am now
speaking of my own case still), unless we do some great and astonishing
work; speak not then of hell to me now, for more grievous than any hell
is the fall from this glory, and worse than punishments unnumbered the
estrangement from that lot. But still we are gaping after this present
world, and we take not thought of the devil’s cunning, who by little
things bereaves us of those great ones, and gives us clay that he may
snatch from us gold, or rather that he may snatch Heaven from us, and
showeth us a shadow that he may dispossess us of the reality, and puts
phantoms before us in dreams (for such is the wealth of this world),
that at daybreak <span id="fr_1444"></span>[1445](#fn_1444.md) he may prove
us the poorest of men. Laying these things to heart, late though it be,
let us fly from this craft, and pass to the side of things to come. For
we cannot say that we were ignorant how exposed to accidents the present
life is, since things every day din in our ears more loudly than a
trumpet, the worthlessness, the ridiculousness, the shamefulness, the
dangers, the pitfalls, of the present scene. What defence then shall we
have to set up for pursuing things so subject to hazards, and laden with
shame, with so much eagerness, and leaving things unfailing, which will
make us glorious and bright, and giving our whole selves up to the
thraldom of money? For the slavery to these things is worse than any
bondage. And this they know who have been counted worthy to obtain their
freedom from it. That ye then may also feel this goodly liberty, burst
the bonds asunder, spring out of the snare. And let there be no gold
lying by in your houses, but that which is more precious than millions
of money, alms and love to man, for your treasure. For this gives us
boldness toward God, but the other covers us with deep shame, and causes
the devil to bear hard (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xvi-p69.3"></span>σφοδρὸν πνεἵν</span>) upon us. Why then arm
thy enemy, and make him stronger? Arm thy right hand against him, and
transfer all the splendor of thy house into thy soul, and stow away all
thy fortune in thy mind, and instead of a chest and a house, let heaven
keep thy gold. And let us put all our property about our own selves; for
we are much better than the walls, and more dignified than the pavement.
Why then do we, to the neglect of our own selves, waste all our
attention upon those things, which when we are gone we can no longer
reach, and often even while we stay here we cannot keep hold of, when we
might have such riches as to be found not in this life only, but also in
that, in the easiest circumstances? For he who carries about his farms
and house and gold upon his soul, wherever he appears, appears with all
this wealth. And how is this possible to be effected? one may ask. It is
possible, and that with the utmost ease. For if you transfer them to
Heaven by the poor man’s hand, you will transfer them entire into your
own soul. And if death should afterwards come upon thee, no one will
take them from thee, but thou wilt depart to be rich in the next world
too. This was the kind of treasure Tabitha had. Hence it was not her
house that proclaimed her wealth, nor the walls, nor the stones, nor the
pillars, but the bodies of widows furnished with dress, and their tears
that were shed, and death that played the runaway, and life that came
back again. Let us also make unto ourselves such-like treasures, let us
build up for ourselves such-like houses. In this way we shall have God
for our Fellow-worker, and we ourselves shall be workers together with
Him. For Himself brought the poor from not being into being, and you
will prevent them, after they have been brought into life and being,
from perishing with hunger and other distress, by tending them and
setting them upright, staying up the Temple of God in every quarter.
What can be equal to this in respect both of utility and of glory? Or if
as yet you have not gained any clear notion of the great adornment He
bestowed upon thee when He bade thee relieve poverty, consider this
point with thyself. If He had given thee so great power, that thou wert
able to set up again even the Heaven if it were falling, wouldest thou
not think the thing an honor far too great for thee? See now He hath
held thee worthy of a greater honor. For that which in His esteem is
more precious than the Heavens, <span
id="fr_1445"></span>[1446](#fn_1445.md) He hath trusted thee to repair. For
of all things visible there is nothing in God’s esteem equal to man. For
Heaven and earth and sea did He make for him, and finds more pleasure in
dwelling with him than in the Heaven. And yet we, though with a
knowledge of this, bestow no attention nor forethought upon the temples
of God; but leaving them in a neglected state, we provide houses
splendid and large for ourselves. This is why we are devoid of all good
things, and greater beggars than the poorest poor, because we pride
ourselves in these houses which we cannot take away with us when we go
hence, and leave those alone which we might move away along with our own
selves. For the bodies of the poor after dissolution must needs rise
again; and God, Who hath given this charge, will bring them forth, and
praise those who have taken care of them, and treat such with regard
(<span class="Greek"><span id="vii.xvi-p70.2"></span>θαυμάσεται</span>),
because when they were on the point of falling to ruin at one time by
starvation, at another by nakedness and cold, these repaired them by all
means in their power. But still, even with all these praises set before
us, we loiter yet, and decline undertaking this honorable charge. And
Christ indeed hath not where to lodge, but goeth about a stranger, and
naked, and hungry, and you set up houses out of town, and baths, and
terraces, and chambers without number, in thoughtless vanity; and to
Christ you give not even a share of a little hut, while for daws and
vultures you deck out upper chambers. What can be worse than such
insanity as this? What more grievous than such madness? for madness it
is in the last stage of it, or rather one has no name to suit it, use
whatever one may. Yet still if we be so minded, it is possible to beat
off the disorder, tenacious as it is; and not possible only, but even
easy; and not easy merely, but even easier is it to get rid of this pest
than of the sufferings of the body, since the Physician is so much
greater. Let us then draw Him to ourselves, and invite Him to aid us in
the attempt, and let us contribute our share, good-will, I mean, and
energy. For He will not require anything further, but if He can meet
with this only, He will confer all that is His part. Let us then
contribute our share, that in this world we may enjoy a genuine health,
and may attain to the good things to come, by the grace and love towards
man, etc.

<span id="vii.xvi-p27"></span> Chrysostom’s interpretation of <span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.xvi-p27.1"></span>ἡ</span> <span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.xvi-p27.2"></span>κτίσις</span> is
undoubtedly correct in principle, although he probably gives to it too
general an idea in calling it “this whole world”—reaching “even to
things without sense also.” It is more likely that the apostle has in
mind distinctively the *irrational creation.* (So Meyer, Godet, Thayer,
Dwight). Nature is subject to “vanity”—i.e. the law of decay and death,
and is poetically spoken of as awaiting the revelation of the sons of
God in the hope of sharing in it. The apostle explains that the <span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.xvi-p27.3"></span>κτίσις</span> was placed
in this condition not of its own accord but on account of the will of
God, who, however, subjected it to the forces of decay and death on the
ground of hope. Hope was the attendant condition of this subjection
which took place in consequence of the fall. Hence this condition is not
final and the creation desires and groans to be delivered and to share
in the “manifestation of the sons of God”—the revelation of them in
their true character in the presence of the universe at the coming of
Christ.—G.B.S.

<span id="vii.xvi-p32"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xvi-p32.1"></span>διὰ τὴν</span>. St. Chrysostom does not mean
to say that one preposition is used for another, as his illustration
shows. For the liberty of the sons of God is both the thing of which the
creation partakes, and the cause of its partaking; so that the one is
put in a sense which implies the other too.

sometimes the manner, and sometimes the completeness of redemption
predominates; see [Rom. iii. 24](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#024.md)<span

<span id="vii.xvi-p38"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xvi-p38.1"></span>λύτρωσις</span>, showing that the completeness
is implied in the preposition, which should be observed in the doctrinal
use of the term.

id="vii.xvi-p40.1"></span>

<span id="vii.xvi-p41"></span> This blending of faith and hope
illustrates the connection of faith and love, the Object of love being
now known by faith, and appropriated by hope. The personification which
follows is a powerful way of representing that in us which apprehends
God as itself His gift.

<span id="fn_1430"></span>[i:1431](1110077.htm#fr_1430.md) <span
id="vii.xvi-p41.1"></span>

<span id="vii.xvi-p42"></span> So the <span class="c14"><span
id="vii.xvi-p42.1"></span>mss.</span> and Catena: the old reading was
<span class="Greek"><span id="vii.xvi-p42.2"></span>οὐ

<span id="vii.xvi-p46"></span> *Magna est vis Græci verbi* <span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.xvi-p46.1"></span>συναντιλαμβανέσθαι</span>,
said Calvin. The word means: “takes hold together with us, as if on the
other side or as if instead of us” (Godet). The notion of lifting the
other end of a burden, or perhaps, of taking hold of it in our place,
seems to lie at the basis of this expressive word. Cf. [Luke x.

<span id="vii.xvi-p48"></span> These words show that St. Chrysostom does
not mean that we do any good unaided, however much he insists on the
freedom of our will.

<span id="fn_1433"></span>[i:1434](1110077.htm#fr_1433.md) <span
id="vii.xvi-p50.3"></span>

<span id="vii.xvi-p51"></span> See Bishop Bull, *Serm. V.* who discusses
what this was.

<span id="fn_1434"></span>[i:1435](1110077.htm#fr_1434.md) <span
id="vii.xvi-p51.7"></span>

<span id="vii.xvi-p52"></span> St. Ambrose, *Epist.* 36, gives the same
interpretation.

<span id="fn_1435"></span>[i:1436](1110077.htm#fr_1435.md) <span
id="vii.xvi-p57.4"></span>

<span id="vii.xvi-p58"></span> The peculiar position of the negative
resembles that in Eur. *Hec.* 1131 (al. 1149), <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xvi-p58.1"></span>ἵ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xvi-p58.2"></span>ν ἄλλος μή τις εἰδείη τάδε</span>.

<span id="fn_1436"></span>[i:1437](1110077.htm#fr_1436.md) <span
id="vii.xvi-p58.5"></span>

<span id="vii.xvi-p59"></span> 6 <span class="c14"><span
id="vii.xvi-p59.1"></span>mss.</span> with glorying, i.e. with something
good done on man’s part.

<span id="fn_1437"></span>[i:1438](1110077.htm#fr_1437.md) <span

id="vii.xvi-p60.1"></span>ἔ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xvi-p60.2"></span>ντρεψαι</span>perhaps “to urge him to
compassion;” (there is no pronoun with this verb).

<span id="fn_1438"></span>[i:1439](1110077.htm#fr_1438.md) <span
id="vii.xvi-p60.16"></span>

<span id="vii.xvi-p61"></span> So all <span class="c14"><span
id="vii.xvi-p61.1"></span>mss.</span> but one, and that is obviously an
emendation: both the passages cited are from Isaiah.

<span id="fn_1439"></span>[i:1440](1110077.htm#fr_1439.md) <span

<span id="vii.xvi-p63"></span> All <span class="c14"><span

id="vii.xvi-p63.2"></span>κἂν δἰ ἄργιαν κἂν διὰ ῥ& 139·θυμίαν</span>,
which order agrees with the stronger sense here given to <span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.xvi-p63.3"></span>ῥ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.xvi-p63.4"></span>ᾳ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.xvi-p63.5"></span>θυμία</span>:
“listlessness” is generally too little expressive of that readiness to
yield to temptations which this word implies. But 1 <span
class="c14"><span id="vii.xvi-p63.6"></span>ms</span>. reads “rather all
through vice,” <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xvi-p63.7"></span>κακίαν</span>, which tends to give the other
word a lighter sense.

the spirit seems to be considered apart from the soul.
