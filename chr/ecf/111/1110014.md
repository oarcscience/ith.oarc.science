<span id="vi.ix"></span> <span id="vi.ix-p0.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ix-p1"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vi.ix-p1.1"></span>Homily IX.</span>

<span id="vi.ix-p2"></span>[Acts III.
12](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#012.md)<span id="vi.ix-p2.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ix-p3"></span>“And when Peter saw it, he answered unto the
people, Ye men of Israel, why marvel ye at this, or why look ye so
earnestly on us, as though by our own power or holiness we have made
this man to walk?”

<span id="vi.ix-p4"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="vi.ix-p4.1"></span>There</span> is greater freedom of speech in this
harangue, than in the former. Not that he was afraid on the former
occasion, but the persons whom he addressed there, being jesters and
scoffers, would not have borne it. Hence in the beginning of that
address he also bespeaks their attention by his preamble; “Be this known
unto you, and hearken to my words.” ([Acts
2.14](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#014)<span id="vi.ix-p4.2"></span>..md)
But here there is no need of this management. (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ix-p4.3"></span>κατασκευἥς</span>.) For his hearers were not in a
state of indifference. The miracle had aroused them all; they were even
full of fear and amazement. Wherefore also there was no need of
beginning at that point, but rather with a different topic; by which, in
fact, he powerfully conciliated them, namely, by rejecting the glory
which was to be had from them. For nothing is so advantageous, and so
likely to pacify the hearers, as to say nothing about one’s self of an
honorable nature, but, on the contrary, to obviate all surmise of
wishing to do so. And, in truth, much more did they increase their glory
by despising glory, and showing that what had just taken place was no
human act, but a Divine work; and that it was their part to join with
the beholders in admiration, rather than to receive it from them. Do you
see how clear of all ambition he is, and how he repels the honor paid to
him? In the same manner also did the ancient fathers; for instance,
Daniel said, “Not for any wisdom that is in me.” ([Dan. ii.
30](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#030)<span id="vi.ix-p4.4"></span>..md) And
again Joseph, “Do not interpretations belong to God?” (<span
id="vi.ix-p4.5"></span>[Gen. xi.
8](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#008)<span id="vi.ix-p4.6"></span>..md) And
David, “When the lion and the bear came, in the name of the Lord I rent
them with my hands.” (<span id="vi.ix-p4.7"></span>[1 Sam. xvii.
34](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#034)<span id="vi.ix-p4.8"></span>..md) And
so likewise here the Apostles, “Why look ye so earnestly on us, as
though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk?”
([Acts 3.13](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#013.md)<span
id="vi.ix-p4.9"></span>.) Nay, not even this; <span
id="fr_209"></span>[210](#fn_209.md) for not by our own merit did we draw
down the Divine influence. “The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of
Jacob, the God of our fathers.” See how assiduously he thrusts himself
(<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.ix-p5.5"></span>εἰσωθει</span>) upon
the fathers of old, lest he should appear to be introducing a new
doctrine. In the former address he appealed to the patriarch David, here
he appeals to Abraham and the rest. “Hath glorified His Servant <span
id="fr_210"></span>[211](#fn_210.md) Jesus.” Again a lowly expression, like
as in the opening address.

<span id="vi.ix-p7"></span>But at this point he proceeds to enlarge upon
the outrage, and exalts the heinousness of the deed, no longer, as
before, throwing a veil over it. This he does, wishing to work upon them
more powerfully. For the more he proved them accountable, the better his
purpose were effected. “Hath glorified,” he says, “His Servant Jesus,
Whom ye delivered up, and denied Him in the presence of Pilate, when he
was determined to let him go.” The charge is twofold: Pilate was
desirous to let Him go; you would not, when he was willing. “But ye
denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer to be granted
unto you; and killed the Prince (or Author) of Life: Whom God hath
raised from the dead; whereof we are witnesses.” ([Acts
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#014.md),
[15](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#015)<span id="vi.ix-p7.1"></span>..md) Ye
desired a robber instead of Him. He shows the great aggravation of the
act. As he has them under his hand, he now strikes hard. “The Prince of
Life,” he says. In these words he establishes the doctrine of the
Resurrection. “Whom God hath raised from the dead.” ([Acts
2.26](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#026)<span id="vi.ix-p7.2"></span>..md)
“Whence doth this appear?” He no longer refers to the Prophets, but to
himself, inasmuch as now he has a right to be believed. Before, when he
affirmed that He was risen, he adduced the testimony of David; now,
having said it, he alleges the College of Apostles. “Whereof we are
witnesses,” he says.

<span id="vi.ix-p8"></span>“And His name, through faith in His name,
hath made this man strong, whom ye see and know: yea, the faith which is
by Him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you
all.” Seeking to declare the matter (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ix-p8.1"></span>ζητὥν τὸ πρἅγμα εὶπεἵν</span>), he straightway
brings forward the sign: “In the presence,” he says, “of you all.” As he
had borne hard upon them, and had shown that He Whom they crucified had
risen, again he relaxes, by giving them the power of repentance; “And
now, brethren, I wot that through ignorance ye did it, as did also your
rulers.” ([Acts 3.17](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#017.md)<span
id="vi.ix-p8.2"></span>.) This is one ground of excuse. The second <span
id="fr_211"></span>[212](#fn_211.md) is of a different kind. As Joseph
speaks to his brethren, “God did send me before you ([Gen. xlv.
5](../../../bib/kjv/gen045.htm#005)<span id="vi.ix-p9.4"></span>.md); what
in the former speech he had briefly said, in the words, “Him, being
delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have
taken,”—this he here enlarges upon: “But what God before had showed by
the mouth of all His Prophets, that His Christ should suffer, He hath so
fulfilled.” ([Acts 3.18](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#018.md)<span
id="vi.ix-p9.5"></span>.) At the same time showing, that it was not of
their doing, if this be proved, that it took place after God’s counsel.
He alludes to those words with which they had reviled Him on the Cross,
namely “Let Him deliver Him, if He will have Him; for He said, I am the
Son of God. If <span id="fr_212"></span>[213](#fn_212.md) He trust in God,
let Him now come down from the cross.” ([Matt.
27:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#042.md),
[43](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#043)<span id="vi.ix-p10.4"></span>..md) O
foolish men, were these idle words? It must needs so come to pass, and
the prophets bear witness thereunto. Therefore if He descended not, it
was for no weakness of His own that He did not come down, but for very
power. And Peter puts this by way of apology for the Jews, hoping that
they may also close with what he says. “He hath so fulfilled,” he says.
Do you see now how he refers everything to that source? “Repent ye
therefore,” he says, “and be converted.” He does not add, “from your
sins;” but, “that your sins, may be blotted out,” means the same thing.
And then he adds the gain: “So shall the times of refreshing come from
the presence of the Lord.” ([Acts
3.19](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#019)<span id="vi.ix-p10.5"></span>..md)
This betokens them in a sad state, brought low by many wars. <span
id="fr_213"></span>[214](#fn_213.md) For it is to the case of one on fire,
and craving comfort, that the expression applies. And see now how he
advances. In his first sermon, he but slightly hinted at the
resurrection, and Christ’s sitting in heaven; but here he also speaks of
His visible advent. “And He shall send Jesus the Christ ordained <span
id="fr_214"></span>[215](#fn_214) (for you.md), “Whom the heaven must
(*i.e.* must of necessity) receive, until the times of the restitution
of all things.” The reason why He does not now come is clear. “Which God
hath spoken,” he continues, “by the mouth <span
id="fr_215"></span>[216](#fn_215.md) of His holy prophets since the world
began. For Moses truly said unto the fathers, A Prophet shall the Lord
your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye
hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you.” Before, he had
spoken of David, here he speaks of Moses. “Of all things,” he says,
“which He hath spoken.” But he does not say, “which Christ,” but, “which
God hath spoken <span id="fr_216"></span>[217](#fn_216.md) by the mouth of
all His holy prophets since the world began.” ([Acts
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#020.md),
[21](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#021)<span id="vi.ix-p14.1"></span>..md)
Then he betakes him to the ground of credibility, saying, “A Prophet
shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto
me; Him shall ye hear in all things.” And then the greatness of the
punishment: “And it shall come to pass, that every soul which will not
hear that Prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people. Yea, and
all the prophets, from Samuel and those that follow, after, as many as
have spoken have likewise foretold of these days.” ([Acts
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#023.md),
[24](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#024)<span id="vi.ix-p14.2"></span>..md) He
has done well to set the distinction here. For whenever he says anything
great, he appeals to them of old. And he found a text which contained
both truths; just as in the other discourse he said, “Until He put His
foes under His feet.” ([Acts 2.35](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#035.md)<span
id="vi.ix-p14.3"></span>.) The remarkable circumstance is, that the two
things stand together; that is, subjection and disobedience, and the
punishment. “Like unto me,” he says. Then why are ye alarmed? “Ye are
the children of the prophets” ([Acts
3.25](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#025)<span id="vi.ix-p14.4"></span>.md):
so that to you they spake, and for your sakes have all these things come
to pass. For as they deemed that through their outrage they had become
alienated (and indeed there is no parity of reason, that He Who now is
crucified, should now cherish them as His own), he proves to them that
both the one and the other are in accordance with prophecy. “Ye are the
children,” he says, “of the Prophets, and of the covenant which God made
with our fathers, saying unto Abraham, ‘And in thy seed shall all the
kindreds of the earth be blessed.’ Unto you first,” he continues, “God
having raised up His Son (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ix-p14.5"></span>τόν Παἵδα</span>) sent Him.” “To others indeed
also, but to you first who crucified Him.” “To bless you,” he adds, “in
turning away every one of you from his iniquities.” ([Acts
3.26](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#026)<span id="vi.ix-p14.6"></span>..md)

<span id="vi.ix-p15"></span>Now let us consider again more minutely what
has been read out. (Recapitulation.) In the first place, he establishes
the point that the miracle was performed by them <span
id="fr_217"></span>[218](#fn_217.md) ; saying, “Why marvel ye?” And he will
not let the assertion be disbelieved: and to give it more weight, he
anticipates their judgment. “Why look ye,” he says, “so earnestly on us,
as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk?”
([Acts 3.12](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#012.md)<span
id="vi.ix-p16.5"></span>.) If this troubles and confounds you, learn Who
was the Doer, and be not amazed. And observe how on all occasions when
he refers to God, and says that all things are from Him, then he
fearlessly chides them: as above where he said, “A man approved of God
among you.” ([Acts. 2.22](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#022.md)<span
id="vi.ix-p16.6"></span>.) And on all occasions he reminds them of the
outrage they had committed, in order that the fact of the Resurrection
may be established. But here he also subjoins something else; for he no
more says, “of Nazareth,” but what? “The God of our fathers hath
glorified His Servant Jesus.” ([Acts
3.13](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#013)<span id="vi.ix-p16.7"></span>..md)
Observe also the modesty. He reproached them not, neither did he say at
once, “Believe then now: behold, a man that has been forty years lame,
has been raised up through the name of Jesus Christ.” This he did not
say, for it would have excited opposition. On the contrary, he begins by
commending them for admiring the deed, and again calls them after their
ancestor: “Ye men of Israel.” Moreover, he does not say, It was Jesus
that healed him: but, “The God of our fathers hath glorified,” etc. But
then, lest they should say, How can this stand to reason—that God should
glorify the transgressor? therefore he reminds them of the judgment
before Pilate, showing that, would they but consider, He was no
transgressor; else Pilate had not wished to release Him. And he does not
say, “when Pilate was desirous,” but, “was determined to let Him go.”
“But ye denied the Holy One,” etc. ([Acts
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#013.md),
[14](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#014)<span id="vi.ix-p16.8"></span>..md)
Him who had killed others, ye asked to be released; Him Who quickeneth
them that are killed, ye did not wish to have! And that they might not
ask again, How should it be that God now glorifies Him, when before He
gave no assistance? he brings forward the prophets, testifying that so
it behooved to be. “But those things which God before had showed,” etc.,
(*infra* [Acts 3.18](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#018.md)<span
id="vi.ix-p16.9"></span>.) Then, lest they should suppose that God’s
dispensation was their own apology, first he reproves them. Moreover,
that the denying Him “to Pilate’s face,” was no ordinary thing; seeing
that he wished to release Him. And that ye cannot deny this, the man who
was asked in preference to Him is witness against you. This also is part
of a deep dispensation. Here it shows their shamelessness and
effrontery; that a Gentile, one who saw Him for the first time, should
have discharged Him, though he had heard nothing striking; while they
who had been brought up among His miracles, have done the very opposite!
For, as he has said, “When he (Pilate) had determined to let Him go,”
that it may not be imagined that he did this of favor, we read, “And he
said, It is a custom with you to release one prisoner: will ye therefore
that I release unto you this man? ([Matt. xxvii.
15](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#015)<span id="vi.ix-p16.10"></span>..md)
“But ye denied the Holy One and the Just.” ([Mark xv.
6](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#006)<span id="vi.ix-p16.11"></span>..md) He
does not say, “Ye delivered up;” but everywhere, “Ye denied.” For, said
they, “We have no king but Cæsar.” ([John xix.
15](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#015)<span id="vi.ix-p16.12"></span>..md)
And he does not say only, Ye did not beg off the innocent, and, “Ye
denied” Him but, “Ye slew” Him. While they were hardened, he refrained
from such language; but when their minds are most moved, then he strikes
home, now that they are in a condition to feel it. For just as when men
are drunk we say nothing to them, but when they are sober, and are
recovered from their intoxication then we chide them; thus did Peter:
when they were able to understand his words, then he also sharpened his
tongue, alleging against them many charges; that, Whom God had
glorified, they had delivered up; Whom Pilate would have acquitted they
denied to his face; that they preferred the robber before Him.

<span id="vi.ix-p17"></span>Observe again how he speaks covertly
concerning Christ’s power, showing that He raised Himself: just as in
his first discourse he had said, “Because it was not possible that He
should be holden of it” ([Acts
2.24](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#024)<span id="vi.ix-p17.1"></span>.md),
so here he says, “And killed the Prince of Life.” ([Acts
3.15](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#015)<span id="vi.ix-p17.2"></span>..md)
It follows that the Life He had was not from another. The prince (or
author) of evil would be he that first brought forth evil; the prince or
author of murder, he who first originated murder; so also the Prince (or
Author) of Life must be He Who has Life from Himself. <span
id="fr_218"></span>[219](#fn_218.md) “Whom God raised up,” he continues:
and now that he has uttered this, he adds, “And his name, upon faith in
his name, hath made this man strong, whom ye see and know; yea, the
faith which is by Him hath given Him this perfect soundness. \[The faith
which is by Him <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ix-p18.2"></span>ἡ</span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ix-p18.3"></span>δι᾽ αὐτοὕ πίστις</span>.\] And <span
id="fr_219"></span>[220](#fn_219.md) yet it was <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ix-p19.10"></span>ἡ</span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ix-p19.11"></span>εἰς αὐτὸν πιστις</span>, “the faith which is in
Him” (as its object) that did all. For the Apostles did not say, “By the
name,” but, “In the name,” and it was in Him (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ix-p19.12"></span>εἰς αὐτὸν</span>) that the man believed. But
they did not yet make bold to use the expression, “The faith which is in
Him.” For, that the phrase “By Him” should not be too low, observe that
after saying, “Upon the faith of His name,” he adds, “His name hath made
him strong,” and then it is that he says, “Yea, the faith which is by
Him hath given him this perfect soundness.” Observe how he implies, that
in the <span class="Greek"><span id="vi.ix-p19.13"></span>καὶ
ἐκεἵνο</span> former expression also “Whom God raised up,” he did but
condescend to their low attainments. For that Person needed not
Another’s help for His rising again, Whose Name raised up a lame man,
being all one as dead. Mark how on all occasions he adduces their own
testimony. Thus above, he said, “As ye yourselves also know;” and, “In
the midst of you:” and here again, “Whom ye see and know: in the
presence of you all.” ([Acts 2.22](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#022.md)<span
id="vi.ix-p19.14"></span>.) And yet that it was, “In His name,” they
knew not: but they did know that the man was lame, that he stands there
whole. <span id="fr_220"></span>[221](#fn_220.md) They that had wrought the
deed themselves confessed, that it was not by their own power, but by
that of Christ. And had this assertion been unfounded, had they not been
truly persuaded themselves that Christ had risen again, they would not
have sought to establish the honor of a dead man instead of their own,
especially while the eyes of the multitude were upon them. Then, when
their minds were alarmed, immediately he encourages them, by the
appellation of Brethren, “And now, brethren, I wot, etc.” For in the
former discourse he foretold <span id="fr_221"></span>[222](#fn_221.md)
nothing, but only says concerning Christ, “Therefore let all the house
of Israel know assuredly:” here he adds an admonition. There he waited
till the people spoke: here, he knew how much they had already effected,
and that the present assembly was better disposed toward them. “That
through ignorance ye did it.” And yet the circumstances mentioned above
were not to be put to the score of ignorance. To choose the robber, to
reject Him Who had been adjudged to be acquitted, to desire even to
destroy Him—how should this be referred to ignorance? Nevertheless, he
gives them liberty to deny it, and to change their mind about what had
happened. “Now this indeed, that you put to death the innocent, ye knew:
but that you were killing “the Prince of Life,” this, belike, ye did not
know.” And he exculpated not them alone, but also the chief contrivers
of the evil, “ye and your rulers:” for doubtless it would have roused
their opposition, had he gone off into accusation. For the evil-doer,
when you accuse him of some wickedness that he has done, in his endeavor
to exonerate himself, grows more vehement. And he no longer says, “Ye
crucified,” “Ye killed,” but, “Ye did it;” leading them to seek for
pardon. If those rulers did it through ignorance, much more did these
present. <span id="fr_222"></span>[223](#fn_222.md) “But these things which
God before had showed,” etc. ([Acts
3.18](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#018)<span id="vi.ix-p22.4"></span>..md)
But it is remarkable, that both in the first and in the second
discourse, speaking to the same effect, that is, in the former, “By the
determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God;” and in this, “God before
had showed that Christ should suffer;” in neither does he adduce any
particular text in proof. The fact is, that each one of such passages is
accompanied with many accusations, and with mention of the punishment in
store for them \[as\]; “I will deliver up,” says one, “the wicked in
requital for His grave, and the rich in return for His death.” (<span
id="vi.ix-p22.5"></span>[Is. liii.
9](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#009)<span id="vi.ix-p22.6"></span>..md) And
again, \* \* \* “Those things,” he says, “which God before had showed by
the mouth of all His prophets, that Christ should suffer, He hath so
fulfilled.” It shows the greatness of that “counsel,” <span
id="fr_223"></span>[224](#fn_223.md) in that *all* spoke of it, and not one
only. It does not follow, because the event was through ignorance, that
it took place irrespectively of God’s ordinance. See how great is the
Wisdom of God, when it uses the wickedness of others to bring about that
which must be. “He hath fulfilled,” he says: that they may not imagine
that anything at all is wanting; for whatsoever Christ must needs
suffer, has been fulfilled. But do not think, that, because the Prophets
said this, and because ye did it through ignorance, this sufficeth to
your exculpation. However, he does not express himself thus, but in
milder terms says, “Repent ye therefore.” ([Acts
3.19](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#019)<span id="vi.ix-p23.3"></span>..md)
“Why? For <span id="fr_224"></span>[225](#fn_224.md) either it was through
ignorance, or by the dispensation of God.” “That your sins may be
blotted out.” I do not mean the crimes committed at the Crucifixion;
perhaps they were through ignorance; but so that your other sins may be
blotted out: this <span id="fr_225"></span>[226](#fn_225.md) only. “So
shall the times of refreshing come unto you.” Here he speaks of the
Resurrection, obscurely. <span id="fr_226"></span>[227](#fn_226.md) For
those are indeed times of refreshing, which Paul also looked for, when
he said, “We that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burthened.” ([2
Cor. v. 4](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#004.md)<span
id="vi.ix-p26.2"></span>.) Then to prove that Christ is the cause of the
days of refreshing, he says, “And He shall send Jesus Christ, which
before was for you ordained.” ([Acts
3.20](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#020)<span id="vi.ix-p26.3"></span>..md)
He said not, “That your sin may be blotted out,” but, “your sins;” for
he hints at that sin also. “He shall send.” And whence? <span
id="fr_227"></span>[228](#fn_227.md) “Whom the heaven must receive.” ([Acts
3.21](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#021)<span id="vi.ix-p27.9"></span>..md)
Still \[“must”\] “receive?” And why not simply, Whom the heaven hath
received? This, as if discoursing of old times: so, he says, it is
divinely ordered, so it is settled: not a word yet of His eternal
subsistence.—“For Moses indeed said unto the fathers, A Prophet shall
the Lord raise up for you:” “Him shall ye hear in all things that He
shall speak unto you:” and having said, “All things which God hath
spoken by the mouth of all His holy Prophets,” ([Acts
3.22](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#022)<span id="vi.ix-p27.10"></span>.md)
now indeed he brings in Christ Himself. For, if He predicted many things
and it is necessary to hear Him, one would not be wrong in saying that
the Prophets have spoken these things. But, besides, he wishes to show
that the Prophets did predict the same things. And, if any one will look
closely into the matter, he will find these things spoken in the Old
Testament, obscurely indeed, but nevertheless spoken. “Who was purposely
designed,” says he: in Whom <span id="fr_228"></span>[229](#fn_228.md)
there is nothing novel. Here he also alarms them, by the thought that
much remains to be fulfilled. But if so, how says he, “Hath fulfilled?”
([Acts 3.18](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#018.md)<span
id="vi.ix-p28.20"></span>.) The things which it was necessary “that
Christ should suffer,” are fulfilled: the things which must come to
pass, not yet. “A prophet shall the Lord God raise up for you from among
your brethren, like unto me.” This would most conciliate them. Do you
observe the sprinkling of low matters and high, side by side,—that He
Who was to go up into the heavens should be like unto Moses? And yet it
was a great thing too. For in fact He was not simply like unto
Moses, <span id="fr_229"></span>[230](#fn_229.md) if so be that “every soul
which will not hear shall be destroyed.” And one might mention
numberless other things which show that He was not like unto Moses; so
that it is a mighty text that he has handled. “God shall raise Him up
unto you,” says Moses, “from among your brethren,” etc.: consequently
Moses himself threatens those that should not hear. “Yea, and all the
prophets,” etc.: all this <span id="fr_230"></span>[231](#fn_230.md) is
calculated to attract “Yea, and all the prophets,” says the Apostle,
“from Samuel.” He refrains from enumerating them singly, not to make his
discourse too long; but having alleged that decisive testimony of Moses,
he passes by the rest. “Ye,” he says, “are the children of the Prophets,
and of the covenant which God made.” ([Acts
3.25](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#025)<span id="vi.ix-p30.4"></span>.md)
“Children of the covenant;” that is, heirs. For lest they should think
that they received this offer from the favor of Peter, he shows, that of
old it was due to them, in order that they may the rather believe that
such also is the will of God. “Unto you first,” he continues, “God
having raised up His Son Jesus, sent Him.” ([Acts
3.26](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#026)<span id="vi.ix-p30.5"></span>..md)
He does not say simply, “Unto you He sent His Son,” but also, after the
resurrection, and when He had been crucified. For that they may not
suppose that he himself granted them this favor, and not the Father, he
says, “To bless you.” For if He is your Brother, and blesses you, the
affair is a promise. “Unto you first.” That is, so far are you from
having no share in these blessings, that He would have you become
moreover promoters and authors of them to others. For <span
id="fr_231"></span>[232](#fn_231.md) you are not to feel like castaways.
“Having raised up”: again, the Resurrection. “In turning away,” he says,
“every one of you from his iniquities.” In this way He blesses you: not
in a general way. And what kind of blessing is this? A great one. For of
course not the turning a man away from his iniquities is itself
sufficient to remit them also. And if it is not sufficient to remit, how
should it be to confer a blessing? For it is not to be supposed that the
transgressor becomes forthwith also blessed; he is simply released from
his sins. But this, <span id="fr_232"></span>[233](#fn_232.md) “Like unto
me,” would no wise apply. “Hear ye Him,” he says; and not this alone,
but he adds, “And it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not
hear that Prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people.” When he
has shown them that they had sinned, and has imparted forgiveness to
them, and promised good things, then indeed, then he says, “Moses also
says the same thing.” What sort of connection is this: “Until the times
of the restitution;” and then to introduce Moses, saying, that <span
id="fr_233"></span>[234](#fn_233.md) all that Christ said shall come to
pass? Then also, on the other hand, he says, as matter of encomium (so
that for this reason also ye ought to obey): “Ye are the children of the
prophets and of the covenant:” i.e. heirs. Then why do you stand
affected towards that which is your own, as if it were another’s? True,
you have done deeds worthy of condemnation; still you may yet obtain
pardon. Having said this, with reason he is now able to say, “Unto you
God sent his Son Jesus to bless you.” He says not, To save you, but what
is greater; that the crucified Jesus blessed His crucifiers.

<span id="vi.ix-p34"></span>Let us then also imitate Him. Let us cast
out that spirit of murder and enmity. It is not enough not to retaliate
(for even in the Old Dispensation this was exemplified); but let us do
all as we would for bosom-friends, as we would for ourselves so for
those who have injured us. We are followers of Him, we are His
disciples, who after being crucified, sets everything in action in
behalf of his murderers, and sends out His Apostles to this end. And yet
we have often suffered justly; but those acted not only unjustly, but
impiously; for He was their Benefactor, He had done no evil, and they
crucified Him. And for what reason? For the sake of their reputation.
But He Himself made them objects of reverence. “The scribes and the
pharisees sit in Moses’ seat; all therefore whatsoever they bid you
observe, that do ye, but after their works do ye not.” ([Matt. xxiii.
2](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#002)<span id="vi.ix-p34.1"></span>..md) And
again in another place, “Go thy way, show thyself to the priest.”
([Matt. 8.4](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#004.md)<span
id="vi.ix-p34.2"></span>.) Besides, when He might have destroyed them,
He saves them. Let us then imitate Him, and let no one be an enemy, no
one a foe, except to the devil.

<span id="vi.ix-p35"></span>Not a little does the habit of not swearing
contribute to this end: I mean to the not giving way to wrath: <span
id="fr_234"></span>[235](#fn_234.md) and by not giving way to wrath, we
shall not have an enemy either. Lop off the oaths of a man, and you have
clipt the wings of his anger, you have smothered all his passion.
Swearing, it is said, is as the wind to wrath. Lower the sails; no need
of sails, when there is no wind. If then we do not clamor, and do not
swear, we have cut the sinews of passion. And if you doubt this, just
put it to experiment. Impose it as a law upon the passionate man that he
shall never swear, and you will have no necessity of preaching
moderation to him. So the whole business is finished. For <span
id="fr_235"></span>[236](#fn_235.md) even though you do not forswear
yourselves \[yet\], by swearing at all, do you not know in what absurd
consequences you involve yourselves—binding yourselves to an absolute
necessity and as with a cord, and putting yourselves to all manner of
shifts, as men studying how to rescue their soul from an evil which
there is no escaping, or, failing of that, obliged \[by that
self-imposed necessity\] to spend your life thenceforth in vexation, in
quarrels, and to curse your wrath? But all is in vain, and to no
purpose. Threaten, be peremptory (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ix-p37.10"></span>διόρισαι</span>), do all, whatever it be,
without swearing; \[so\]: it is in your power to reverse (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.ix-p37.11"></span>ἀ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.ix-p37.12"></span>ναλὕσαι</span>) both what
you have said and what you have done if you have the mind. Thus on the
present day I must needs speak more gently to you. For since ye have
heard me, and the greater part of the reformation is achieved by you,
now then let us see for what purpose the taking of oaths was introduced,
and why allowed to be. In relating to you their first origin, and when
they were conceived, and how, and by whom we shall give you this account
in requital for your obedience. For it is fit that he who has made his
practice right, should be taught the philosophy of the matter, but he
who is not yet doing the right, is not worthy to be told the history.

<span id="vi.ix-p38"></span>They made many covenants in Abraham’s time,
and slew victims, and offered sacrifices, and as yet oaths were not.
Whence then did they come in? When evil increased, when all was
confusion, upside down, when men had turned aside to idolatry: then it
was, then, when men appeared no longer worthy to be believed, that they
called God as witness, as if thereby giving an adequate surety for what
they said. Such in fact is the Oath: it is a security where men’s
principles cannot be trusted. <span id="fr_236"></span>[237](#fn_236.md) So
that in the indictment of the swearer the first charge is this,—that he
is not to be trusted without a surety, and a great surety too: for such
is the exceeding faithlessness, that they ask not man as surety, but
will needs have God! Secondly, the same charge lies against him who
receives the oath: that, in a question of compact, he must drag in God
for warranty, and refuse to be satisfied unless he get Him. O the
excessive stupidity, the insolence of such conduct! Thou, a worm, earth
and dust, and ashes, and vapor, to drag in thy Lord as the surety, and
to compel the other to drag Him in likewise! Tell me, if your servants
were disputing with each other, and exchanging <span
id="fr_237"></span>[238](#fn_237.md) assurances with each other, and the
fellow-servant should declare that for his part he would not be
satisfied till he had their common master given him for surety, would he
not have stripes given him without number, and be made to know that the
master is for other purposes, and not to be put to any such use as this?
Why do I speak of a fellow-servant? <span
id="fr_238"></span>[239](#fn_238.md) For should he choose any respectable
person, would not that person consider it an affront? But I do not wish
to do this, say you. <span id="fr_239"></span>[240](#fn_239.md) Well: then
do not compel the other to do so either: since where men only are in
question, this is done—if your party says, “I give such an one as my
surety,” you do not allow him. “What then,” say you, “am I to lose what
I have given?” I am not speaking of this; but that you allow him to
insult God. For which reason greater shall be the inevitable punishment
to him who forces the oath upon another, than to him who takes it: the
same holds with regard to him who gives an oath when no one asks him.
And what makes it worse, is, that every one is ready to swear, for one
farthing, for some petty item, for his own injustice. All this may be
said, when there is no perjury; but if perjury follow in the train, both
he that imposes and he that takes the oath have turned everything upside
down. “But there are some things,” you will say, “which are unknown.”
Well take these into account, and do nothing negligently; but, if you do
act negligently, take the loss to yourself as your punishment. It is
better to be the loser thus, than in a very different way. For tell
me—you force a man to take an oath, with what expectation? That he will
forswear himself? But this is utter insanity; and the judgment will fall
upon your own head; better you should lose your money, than he be lost.
Why act thus to your own detriment, and to the insulting of God? This is
the spirit of a wild beast, and of an impious man. But you do this in
the expectation that he will not forswear himself? Then trust him
without the oath. “Nay, there are many,” you reply, “who in the absence
of an oath would presume to defraud; but, once the oath taken, would
refrain.” You deceive yourself, man. A man having once learnt to steal,
and to wrong his neighbor, will presume full oft to trample upon his
oath; if on the contrary he shrinks from swearing, he will much more
shrink from injustice. “But he is influenced against his will.” Well
then, he deserves pardon.

<span id="vi.ix-p43"></span>But why am I speaking of this kind of oaths,
while I pass over those in the market-place? For as regards these last,
you can urge none of these pleas. For ten farthings you there have
swearing and forswearing. In fact, because the thunderbolt does not
actually fall from heaven, because all things are not overthrown, you
stand holding God in your bonds: to get a few vegetables, a pair of
shoes, for a little matter of money, calling Him to witness. What is the
meaning of this? Do not let us imagine, that because we are not
punished, therefore we do not sin; this comes of God’s mercy; not of our
merit. Let your oath be an imprecation upon your own child, upon your
own self: say, “Else let the hangman lash my ribs.” But you dare not. Is
God less valuable than thy ribs? is He less precious than thy pate? Say
“Else let me be struck blind.” But no. Christ so spares us, that He will
not let us swear even by our own head; and yet we so little spare the
honor of God, that on all occasions we must drag Him in! Ye know not
what God is, and with what sort of lips he behooves to be invoked. Why,
when we speak of any man of eminent worth, we say, “First wash your
mouth, and then make mention of him:” and yet, that precious Name which
is above every name, the Name which is marvellous in all the earth, the
Name which devils hear and tremble, we haul about as we list! Oh! the
force of habit! thereby has that Name become cheap. No doubt, if you
impose on any one the necessity of coming into the sacred edifice to
take his oath there, you feel that you have made the oath an awful one.
And yet how is it that it seems awful in this way, but because we have
been in the habit of using that at random, but not this? For ought not a
shudder of awe to be felt when God is but named? But now, whereas among
the Jews His Name was held to be so reverend, that it was written upon
plates, and none was allowed to wear the characters except the
high-priest alone: we bandy about His Name like any ordinary word. If
simply to name God was not allowed to all; to call Him to witness, what
audacity is it! nay, what madness! For if need were (rather than this)
to fling away all that you have, ought you not readily to part with all?
Behold, I solemnly declare and testify; reform these oaths of the forum,
these superfluous oaths, <span id="fr_240"></span>[241](#fn_240.md) and
bring to me all those who wish to take them. Behold, in the presence of
this assembly, I charge those who are set apart for the tending of the
Houses of Prayer, I exhort and issue this order to them, that no person
be allowed to take such oaths at his own discretion: or rather, that
none be allowed to swear in any other way, but that the person be
brought to me, whosoever he be, since even for these matters less will
not serve but they must needs come before us, just as if one had to do
with little children. May there be no occasion! It is a shame in some
things still to need to be taught. Do you dare to touch the Holy Table,
being a person unbaptized? No, but what is still worse, you the baptized
dare to lay your hand upon the Holy Table, which not even all ordained
persons are allowed to touch, and so to take your oath. Now you would
not go and lay your hand upon the head of your child, <span
id="fr_241"></span>[242](#fn_241.md) and yet do you touch the Table, and
not shudder, not feel afraid? Bring these men to me; I will judge, and
send them away rejoicing, both the one and the other. <span
id="fr_242"></span>[243](#fn_242.md) Do what you choose; I lay it down as a
law that there be no swearing at all. What hope of salvation, while we
thus make all to have been done in vain? Is this the end of your bills,
and your bonds, that you should sacrifice your own soul? What gain do
you get so great as the loss? Has he forsworn himself? You have undone
both him and yourself. But has he not? even so still you have undone
(both), by forcing him to transgress the commandment. <span
id="fr_243"></span>[244](#fn_243.md) Let us cast out this disease from the
soul: at any rate let us drive it out of the forum, out of our shops,
out of our other work-places; our profits will but be the greater. Do
not imagine that the success of your worldly plans is to be ensured by
transgressions of the Divine laws. “But he refuses to trust me,” say
you; and in fact I have sometimes heard this said by some: “Unless I
swear oaths without number, the man will not trust me.” Yes, and for
this you may thank yourself, because you are so off-hand with your
oaths. For were it not so, but on the contrary were it clear to all men
that you do not swear, take my word for it, you would be more readily
believed upon your mere nod, than those are who swallow oaths by
thousands. For look now: which do you more readily believe? me who do
not swear, or those that do swear? “Yes,” say you, “but then you are
ruler and bishop.” Then suppose I prove to you that it is not only for
that reason? Answer me with truth, I beseech you; were I in the habit of
perpetually swearing, would my office stand me in that stead? Not a
whit. Do you see that it is not for this reason? And what do you gain at
all? Answer me that. Paul endured hunger; do you then also choose to
hunger rather than to transgress one of the commandments of God. Why are
you so unbelieving? Here are you, ready to do and suffer all things for
the sake of not swearing: and shall not He reward you? Shall He, Who
sustains day by day both takers and breakers of oaths, give you over to
hunger, when you have obeyed Him? Let all men see, that of those who
assemble in this Church not one is a swearer. By this also let us become
manifest, and not by our creed alone; let us have this mark also to
distinguish us both from the Gentiles and from all men. Let us receive
it as a seal from heaven, that we may everywhere be seen to be the
King’s own flock. By our mouth and tongue let us be known, in the first
place, just as the barbarians are by theirs: even as those who speak
Greek are distinguished from barbarians, so let us be known. Answer me:
the birds which are said to be parrots, how are they known to be
parrots? is it not by speaking like men? Let us then be known by
speaking like the Apostles; by speaking like the Angels. If any one bid
you swear tell him, “Christ has spoken, and I do not swear.” This is
enough to make a way for all virtue to come in. It is a gate to
religion, a high road leading to the philosophy of piety; <span
id="fr_244"></span>[245](#fn_244.md) a kind of training-school. These
things let us observe, that we may obtain also the future blessings,
through the grace and mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ, to Whom with the
Father and the Holy Ghost together be glory, power and honor, now and
ever, world without end. Amen.

<span id="vi.ix-p18"></span> Peter sharpens his accusation of them by
the following contrasts: (1) This healing at which you wonder is to the
glory of *Christ,* not of us. (2) *God* has glorified whom *you* have
betrayed and denied. (3) This you did though Pilate himself would have
released him. (4) You preferred to kill the *holy and just one* and let
a *murderer* go free. (5) You sought to put to *death* the Author of
*Life.* [Acts 3.12-15](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#012.md)<span

<span id="vi.ix-p19"></span> The meaning of the following passage is
plain enough, but the innovator has so altered it as to make it
unintelligible. Yet the Edd. adopt his reading (E. D. F.) without notice
of the other and genuine reading. “And yet if it was <span

<span id="vi.ix-p22"></span> There is one extenuating circumstance: they
did it in ignorance (Cf. [Luke 23:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#034.md),
[1 Cor. 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#008.md), [Acts

This fact forms the transition-point to the presentation of a different
side of the death of Jesus. It was their crime, but it was also God’s
plan. They did it from motives of blindness and hate, but God designed
it for their salvation. So that Peter, in effect, says: There is hope
for you although you have slain the Lord, for his sacrificial death is
the ground of salvation. To this view of the death of Christ he now
appeals as basis of hope and a motive to repentance (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.ix-p22.2"></span>οὖν</span> [Acts
3.19](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#019.md)<span

therefore.” Why repent? for either it was through ignorance, or it was
predestinated. (Nevertheless, you must repent, to the blotting out of
your sins, etc.)

viewed as imminent, all the expressions: “times of refreshing,” “times
of restitution” and “these days” ([Acts

Erasm. *adhuc accipere.* It means, Is this still to take place, that he
should say <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ix-p27.3"></span>ὃ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ix-p27.4"></span>ν δεῖ δέξασθαι</span>, as if the event were yet
future? And the answer is, “He speaks in reference to former times, i.e.
from that point of view. (So Œcumen. in loc. <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ix-p27.5"></span>τὸ δεῖ ἀντὶ τοῦ ἔδει</span>.) And then as to the
necessity; this <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ix-p27.6"></span>δεῖ</span> is not meant in respect of Christ’s
Divine Nature (for of that he forbears to speak), but the meaning is, So
it is ordered,” etc. The report, however, is very defective, especially
in what follows. He is commenting upon the words, “Until the time of
restitution (or making good) of all that God spake,” etc. <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.ix-p27.7"></span>πάντων ὧν ἐλάλησεν ὁ
Θεὸς</span>, which expression he compares with what is said of the
Prophet like unto Moses, <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ix-p27.8"></span>πάντων ὅσα ἂν λαλησῃ</span>. Christ is that
Prophet: and what He spake, the Prophets, obscurely indeed, spake
before. He adds, that Peter’s mention of the yet future fulfilment of
all that the Prophets have spoken is calculated also to alarm the
hearers. See the further comment on these verses at the end of the
recapitulation.

had before said, that in the very description of “the Prophet like unto

“Every soul which will not hear,” etc. would not apply to Moses. Having

the whole account of the matter: to be raised up (from the dead) and
sent to bless, and this by turning every one from his iniquities, is not
to be simply such as Moses. The modern text adds, “Unless it be taken in
regard of the manner of legislation:” i.e. Christ is like unto Moses

to swear, and not to be angry, is a great help to this.” Which increases
the “intricacy” of which Ben. complains in the following passage, where
oaths are first said to be the wings of wrath, and then are compared to
the wind filling the sails. Here instead of, <span class="Greek"><span

incongruous: oaths, the wings of wrath: oaths the wind, and wrath
(apparently) the sails: but the alterations do not mend the sense.

passionate man, never to swear.…The whole affair is finished, and you
will neither perjure yourselves, nor swear at all.” He seems to be
speaking of oaths and imprecations, by which a man in the heat of
passion binds himself to do or suffer some dreadful thing. “Suppose you
do not perjure yourself, yet think of the misery you entail upon
yourself: you must either study all sorts of expedients to deliver your
soul, or, since that cannot be without perjury, you must spend your life

class="Greek"><span id="vi.ix-p42.3"></span>σὺ οὐκ ἀνέχῃ</span> you
would not allow him.” That this is the meaning, is shown by what
follows: <span class="Greek"><span id="vi.ix-p42.4"></span>ὅ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.ix-p42.5"></span>τι τὸν Θεὸν ὑβρίσαι
ἀνέχῃ</span>: “he insults God, and you suffer him to do it.”

<span id="vi.ix-p44"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ix-p44.1"></span>Τοὺς περιττοὺς, καὶ πάντας ἐμοὶ ἀγάγετε</span>.
E. and Edd. for <span class="Greek"><span id="vi.ix-p44.2"></span>τοὺς
περιττοὺς καὶ</span> have <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ix-p44.3"></span>τοὺς δὲ μὴ πειθομένους</span>. The following
passage relates to a practice of swearing by touching, the Sacred Volume
on the Holy Table. Against this custom he inveighs in one of his Sermons
*ad Pop. Antioch.* xv. §. 5. (t. ii. 158. E.) “What art thou doing, O
man? On the Holy Table, and where Christ lies sacrificed, there
sacrificest thou thy brother?…. sacrificest him in the midst of the
Church, and that, with the death to come, the death which dieth not? Was
the Church made for this, that we should come there to take oaths? No,
but that we should pray there. Does the Table stand there, that we
should make men swear thereby? No, it stands there that we may lose
sins, not that we may bind them. But do thou, if nothing else, at least
reverence the very Volume which thou holdest forth to the other to swear
by: the very Gospel which thou, taking in thine hands, biddest the other
make oath thereby,—open it, read what Christ there saith concerning
oaths, and shudder, and desist.”—Here, he forbids the sacristans to
admit persons for any such purpose. “Let such be brought to me, since I
must needs be the person to be troubled with these things, as if you
were little children, needing to be taught such a simple matter as
this.”

id="vi.ix-p44.4"></span>

<span id="vi.ix-p45"></span> i.e. to take an oath by the head of your
child. So in the *Tract. de Virgin.* t. i. 309 D. it is remarked, that
“men of rude and dull minds, who do not scruple to swear by God in great
matters and small, and break their oath without remorse, would not for a
moment think of swearing by the head of their children: although the
perjury is more heinous, and the penalty more dreadful, in the former
than in the latter case, yet they feel this oath more binding than
that.”

<span id="fn_242"></span>[i:243](1110014.htm#fr_242.md) <span
id="vi.ix-p45.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ix-p46"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ix-p46.1"></span>καὶ χαίροντας ἑκατέρους ἀποπέμψω</span>. i. e.
“both of them glad (to be rid of the quarrel):” unless it is a threat,
in the form of an ironical antiphrasis. In a law-suit one party comes
off rejoicing (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ix-p46.2"></span>χαίρων</span>): here let both exult—if they can.

<span id="fn_243"></span>[i:244](1110014.htm#fr_243.md) <span

<span id="vi.ix-p47"></span> [Matt. v.
34](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#034.md)<span id="vi.ix-p47.1"></span>.
“Swear not at all:” which St. Chrysostom (as the surest remedy) would
enforce literally, and without any exception.
