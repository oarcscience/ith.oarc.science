<span id="vi.xxxvii-p1"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vi.xxxvii-p1.1"></span>Homily XXXVII.</span>

<span id="vi.xxxvii-p2"></span>[Acts
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#001),
[2](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#002),
[3](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#003)<span id="vi.xxxvii-p2.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xxxvii-p3"></span>“Now when they had passed through
Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a
synagogue of the Jews: and Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them,
and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the Scriptures, opening
and alleging that Christ must needs have suffered, and risen again from
the dead; and that this Jesus, whom I preach unto you, is Christ.”

<span id="vi.xxxvii-p4"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="vi.xxxvii-p4.1"></span>Again</span> they haste past the small
cities, and press on to the greater ones, since from those the word was
to flow as from a fountain into the neighboring cities. “And Paul, as
his manner was, went into the synagogue of the Jews.” Although he had
said, “We turn to the Gentiles” ([Acts
13.46](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#046)<span
id="vi.xxxvii-p4.2"></span>), he did not leave these alone: such was the
longing affection he had towards them. For hear him saying, “Brethren,
my heart’s desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be
saved” (<span id="vi.xxxvii-p4.3"></span>[Rom. x.
1](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#001)<span id="vi.xxxvii-p4.4"></span>):
and, “I wished myself accursed from Christ for my brethren.” ([Rom.
9.3](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#003)<span id="vi.xxxvii-p4.5"></span>.)
But he did this <span id="fr_850"></span>[851](#fn_850) because of God’s
promise and the glory: and this, that it might not be a cause of offence
to the Gentiles. “Opening,” it says, “from the Scriptures, he reasoned
with them for three sabbaths, putting before them that the Christ must
suffer.” Do thou mark how before all other things he preaches the
Passion: so little were they ashamed of it, knowing it to be the cause
of salvation. “And some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and
Silas; and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief
women not a few.” ([Acts 17.4](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#004)<span
id="vi.xxxvii-p5.10"></span>.) The writer mentions only the sum and
substance of the discoursing: he is not given to redundancy, and does
not on every occasion report the sermons. “But the Jews which believed
not (the best texts omit “which believed not”), moved with envy, took
unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a
company, and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of
Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people. And when they found
them not, they drew Jason and certain brethren unto the rulers of the
city, crying, These that have turned the world upside down are come
hither also; whom Jason hath received: and these all do contrary to the
decrees of Cæsar, saying that there is another king, one Jesus.” ([Acts
17.5-7](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#005)<span
id="vi.xxxvii-p5.11"></span>.) Oh! what an accusation! again they get up
a charge of treason against them, “saying, there is another king (one)
Jesus. And they troubled the people and the rulers of the city, when
they heard these things. And when they had taken security of Jason, and
of the other, they let them go.” ([Acts
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#008),
[9](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#009)<span id="vi.xxxvii-p5.12"></span>.)
A man worthy to be admired, that he put himself into danger, and sent
them away from it. “And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and
Silas by night unto Berea: who coming thither went into the synagogue of
the Jews. These were more noble,” it says, “than they of Thessalonica:
more noble,” i.e. more gentle (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxvii-p5.13"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxvii-p5.14"></span>πιεικέστεροι</span>) (in their behavior):
“in that they received the word with all readiness,” and this not
inconsiderately, but with a strictness wherein <span
id="fr_851"></span>[852](#fn_851) was no passion, “searching the
Scriptures whether these things were so.” ([Acts
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#010),
[11](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#011)<span id="vi.xxxvii-p6.5"></span>.)
“Therefore many of them believed; also of honorable women which were
Greeks, and of men, not a few. But when the Jews of Thessalonica had
knowledge that the word of God was preached of Paul at Berea, they came
thither also, and stirred up the people. And then immediately the
brethren sent away Paul to go as it were to the sea: but Silas and
Timotheus abode there still.” ([Acts
17.12-14](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#012)<span
id="vi.xxxvii-p6.6"></span>.) See how he at one time gives way, at
another presses on, and in many things takes his measures upon human
considerations. “And they that conducted Paul brought him unto Athens:
and receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timotheus for to come to him
with speed, they departed.” ([Acts
17.15](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#015)<span
id="vi.xxxvii-p6.7"></span>.) But let us look again at what has been
said.

<span id="vi.xxxvii-p7"></span>(Recapitulation.) “Three sabbath-days,”
it says, being the time when they had leisure from work, “he reasoned
with them, opening out of the Scriptures” ([Acts
17.2](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#002)<span
id="vi.xxxvii-p7.1"></span>): for so used Christ also to do: as on many
occasions we find Him reasoning from the Scriptures, and not on all
occasions (urging men) by miracles. Because to this <span
id="fr_852"></span>[853](#fn_852) indeed they stood in a posture of
hostility, calling them deceivers and jugglers; but he that persuades
men by reasons from the Scriptures, is not liable to this imputation.
And on many occasions we find (Paul) to have convinced men simply by
force of teaching: and in Antioch “the whole city was gathered together”
([Acts 13.44](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#044)<span
id="vi.xxxvii-p8.3"></span>): so <span id="fr_853"></span>[854](#fn_853)
great a thing is this also, for indeed this itself is no small miracle,
nay, it is even a very great one. And that they might not think that
they did it all by their own strength, but rather that God permitted
it, <span id="fr_854"></span>[855](#fn_854) two things resulted, namely,
“Some of them were persuaded,” etc. (*c*) “And of devout Greeks a great
multitude, and of the chief women not a few:” <span
id="fr_855"></span>[856](#fn_855) but those others did the contrary:
“the Jews moved with envy,” etc. ([Acts
17:4](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#004),
[5](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#005)<span id="vi.xxxvii-p11.1"></span>)
(*b*) and, from the fact that the being called was itself a matter of
God’s fore-ordering, (*a*) they neither thought great things of
themselves as if the triumph were their own, nor were terrified as being
responsible (for all). But how comes it that he said, “That we should go
unto the heathen, and they unto the circumcision” (<span
id="vi.xxxvii-p11.2"></span>[Gal. ii.
9](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#009)<span id="vi.xxxvii-p11.3"></span>),
and yet discoursed to the Jews? *(<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxvii-p11.4"></span>α</span>)* He did this as a thing over and
above. *(<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxvii-p11.5"></span>β</span>)* For <span
id="fr_856"></span>[857](#fn_856) he did other things also more than he
was obliged. For instance, Christ ordained that they should “live by the
Gospel” (<span id="vi.xxxvii-p12.3"></span>[1 Cor. ix.
14](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#014)<span id="vi.xxxvii-p12.4"></span>;
i. 17), but our Apostle did it not: Christ sent him not to baptize, yet
he did baptize. Mark how he was equal to all. Peter to the circumcision,
he to the Gentiles, to the greater part. *(<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxvii-p12.5"></span>α</span>)* Since if it was necessary for him
to discourse to Jews, how said he again: “For He that wrought
effectually in him toward the circumcision, the same was mighty also in
me toward the Gentiles” (<span id="vi.xxxvii-p12.6"></span>[Gal. ii.
8](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#008)<span id="vi.xxxvii-p12.7"></span>)?
In the same way as those Apostles also had intercourse with the
Gentiles, though they had been set apart for the circumcision, so
likewise did our Apostle. The more part of his work indeed was with the
Gentiles: still he did not neglect the Jews either, that they might not
seem to be severed from them. And how was it, you will ask, that he
entered in the first place into the synagogues, as if this were his
leading object? True; but he persuaded the Gentiles through the Jews,
and from the things which he discoursed of to the Jews. And he knew,
that this was most suitable for the Gentiles, and most conducive to
belief. Therefore he says: “Inasmuch as I am the “Apostle of the
Gentiles.” ([Rom. xi. 13](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#013)<span
id="vi.xxxvii-p12.8"></span>.) And his Epistles too all fight against
the Jews.—“That the Christ,” he says, “must needs have suffered.” ([Acts
17.3](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#003)<span
id="vi.xxxvii-p12.9"></span>.) If there was a necessity for His
suffering, there was assuredly a necessity for His rising again: for the
former <span id="fr_857"></span>[858](#fn_857) was far more wonderful
than the latter. For if He gave Him up to death Who had done no wrong,
much rather did He raise Him up again. “But the Jews which believed not
took unto them certain of the baser sort, and set all the city on an
uproar ([Acts 17.5](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#005)<span
id="vi.xxxvii-p13.6"></span>): so that the Gentiles were more in number.
The Jews thought not themselves enough to raise the disturbance: for
because they had no reasonable pretext, they ever effect such purposes
by means of uproar, and by taking to themselves base men. “And when they
found them not,” it says, “they haled Jason and certain brethren.”
([Acts 17.6](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#006)<span
id="vi.xxxvii-p13.7"></span>.) O the tyranny! dragged them without any
cause out of their houses. “These all,” say they, “do contrary to the
decrees of Cæsar” ([Acts 17.7](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#007)<span
id="vi.xxxvii-p13.8"></span>): for since they spoke nothing contrary to
what had been decreed, nor made any commotion in the city, they bring
them under a different charge: “saying that there is another king, one
Jesus. <span id="fr_858"></span>[859](#fn_858) And they troubled the
people,” etc. ([Acts 17.8](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#008)<span
id="vi.xxxvii-p14.1"></span>.) And what are ye afraid of, seeing He is
dead? *(<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxvii-p14.2"></span>β</span>)*
“And when they had taken security,” etc. ([Acts
17.9](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#009)<span
id="vi.xxxvii-p14.3"></span>.) See how by giving security Jason sent
Paul away: so that he gave his life (to the hazard) for him. <span
id="fr_859"></span>[860](#fn_859) *(<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxvii-p15.2"></span>α</span>)* “And brethren,” etc. ([Acts
17.10](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#010)<span
id="vi.xxxvii-p15.3"></span>.) See how the persecutions in every case
extend the preaching. “Now these,” it says, “were more noble than those
in Thessalonica” ([Acts 17.11](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#011)<span
id="vi.xxxvii-p15.4"></span>): i.e. they were not (men) practising base
things, but some <span id="fr_860"></span>[861](#fn_860) were convinced,
and the others (who were not), did nothing (of that sort). *(<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxvii-p16.1"></span>β</span>)* “Daily,” it
says, “searching the Scriptures whether these things were so:” not
merely upon a sudden impetus or (burst of) zeal. “More noble,” it says:
i. e. in point of virtue*(<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxvii-p16.2"></span>α</span>)*“Therefore many of them,” etc.
([Acts 17.12](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#012)<span
id="vi.xxxvii-p16.3"></span>.) And here again are Greeks. *(<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxvii-p16.4"></span>β</span>)* “But when the
Jews of Thessalonica,” etc. ([Acts
17.13](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#013)<span
id="vi.xxxvii-p16.5"></span>), because there were lewd persons there.
And yet that city was greater. But it is no wonder in the greater city
the people were worse: nay, of course to the greater city there go the
worse men, where the occasions of disturbances are many. And as in the
body, where the disease is more violent for having <span
id="fr_861"></span>[862](#fn_861) more matter and fuel, just so is it
here. *(<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxvii-p17.5"></span>α</span>)*
But look, I beg you, how their fleeing was providentially ordered, not
from cowardice: otherwise they would have ceased to preach, and would
not have exasperated them still more. But from this (flight) two things
resulted: both the rage of those (Jews) was quenched, and the preaching
spread. But in terms befitting their disorderly conduct, he says,
“Agitating the multitude.” *(<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxvii-p17.6"></span>β</span>)* Just what was done at
Iconium—that they may have the additional condemnation of destroying
others besides themselves. ([Acts
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#002),
[19](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#019)<span
id="vi.xxxvii-p17.7"></span>.) This is what Paul says of them:
“Forbidding to preach to the Gentiles, to fill up their sins alway, for
the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost.” (<span
id="vi.xxxvii-p17.8"></span>[1 Thess. ii.
16](../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#016)<span id="vi.xxxvii-p17.9"></span>.)
Why did he not stay? for if (at Lystra, [Acts
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#019),
[21](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#021)<span
id="vi.xxxvii-p17.10"></span>) there, where he was stoned, he
nevertheless stayed a long time, much more here. Why? (The Lord) did not
wish them to be always doing signs; for this is itself a sign, not less
than the working of signs—that being persecuted, they overcame without
signs. So that just as now He prevails without signs, so was it on many
occasions His will to prevail then. Consequently neither did the
Apostles run after signs: as in fact he says himself, “We preach Christ
crucified” (<span id="vi.xxxvii-p17.11"></span>[1 Cor. i.
23](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#023)<span
id="vi.xxxvii-p17.12"></span>)—to them that crave signs, to them that
crave wisdom, we give that which cannot even after signs persuade, and
yet we do persuade! So that this was a mighty sign. See then, how when
the preaching is extended, they are not in a hurry to run after
signs. <span id="fr_862"></span>[863](#fn_862) For it was right that
thenceforth the believers should be mighty signs to the rest. Howbeit,
by retreating and advancing they did these things. *(<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxvii-p18.4"></span>α</span>)* “And
immediately,” it says, “the brethren sent away Paul.” ([Acts
17.14](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#014)<span
id="vi.xxxvii-p18.5"></span>.) Here now they send Paul alone: for it was
for him they feared, lest he should suffer some harm, the head and front
of all being in fact none other than he. *(<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxvii-p18.6"></span>β</span>)* “They sent him away,” it says,
“as it were to the sea:” that it might not be easy for them to seize
him. For <span id="fr_863"></span>[864](#fn_863) at present they could
not have done much by themselves; and with him they accomplished and
achieved many things. For the present, it says, they wished to rescue
him. *(<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxvii-p19.3"></span>α</span>)*
So far is it from being the case, that (supernatural) Grace worked all
alike on all occasions: on the contrary, it left them to take their
measures upon human judgment, (only) stirring them up and rousing them
out of sleep, and making them to take pains. <span
id="fr_864"></span>[865](#fn_864) Thus, observe, it brought them safe
only as far as Philippi, but no more after that. “And receiving,” it
says, “a commandment unto Silas and Timotheus for to come to him with
all speed, they departed.” ([Acts
17.15](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#015)<span
id="vi.xxxvii-p20.4"></span>.) For though he was a Paul, nevertheless he
needed them. And with good reason are they urged by God to go into
Macedonia, for there lay Greece moreover bright (before them). ([Acts
16.9](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#009)<span
id="vi.xxxvii-p20.5"></span>.)

<span id="vi.xxxvii-p21"></span>See what zeal the rest of the disciples
showed with respect to their leaders: not as it is now with us, who are
separated and divided into great and small: some of us exalted, while
others are envious: for this is the reason why those are envious,
because we are puffed up, because we will not endure to be put upon a
par with them. The reason why there is harmony in the body, is because
there is no puffing up: and there is no puffing up, because the members
are of necessity made to stand in need of each other, and the head has
need of the feet. And God has made this to be the case with us, and, for
all that, we will not endure it: although even without this, there ought
to be love among us. Hear ye not how they that are without accuse us
when they say, “Needs make friendships?” The laity have need of us; and
we again exist for them. Since teacher or ruler would not exist, if
there were not persons to be taught, nor would he perform his part, for
it would not be possible. As the land has need of the husbandman, and
the husbandman of the land, so is it here. What reward is there for the
teacher to receive, when he has none to produce that he has taught? and
what for the taught, who have not had the benefit of the best teaching?
So that we need each other alike in turn, both the governed, them that
govern, <span id="fr_865"></span>[866](#fn_865) and leaders, them that
obey: for rulers are for the sake of many. Since no one is sufficient to
do anything by himself alone, whether need be to ordain (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxvii-p22.7"></span>χειροτονἥσαι</span>), or
to examine men’s counsels and opinions, but they become more honorable
by assembly and numbers. For instance, the poor need givers, the givers
again need receivers. “Considering one another” he says, “to provoke
unto love and to good works.” (<span id="vi.xxxvii-p22.8"></span>[Heb.
x. 24](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#024)<span
id="vi.xxxvii-p22.9"></span>.) On this account the assembly of the whole
Church has more power: and what each cannot do by himself singly, he is
able to do when joined with the rest. Therefore most necessary are the
prayers offered up, here, for the world, for the Church, from the one
end of the earth to the other, for peace, for those who are in
adversities. And Paul shows this when he says, “That for the gift
bestowed upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by
many on our behalf” ([2 Cor. i.
11](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#011)<span
id="vi.xxxvii-p22.10"></span>); that is, that He might confer the favor
on many. And often he asks for their prayers. See also what God says
with regard to the Ninevites: “And shall not I spare that city, wherein
dwell more than six score thousand persons?” ([Jonah iv.
11](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#011)<span
id="vi.xxxvii-p22.11"></span>.) For if, “where two or three,” He says,
“are gathered together in My Name” ([Matt. xviii.
20](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#020)<span
id="vi.xxxvii-p22.12"></span>), they prevail much, how much more, being
many? And yet thou mayest prevail, though thou be but one; yet not
equally so. For why art thou but one? Why dost thou not make many? Why
dost thou not become the maker of love? Why dost thou not create (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxvii-p22.13"></span>κατασκευάζεις</span>)
friendship? Thou lackest the chief excellence of virtue. For as men’s
being bad by agreement together more provokes God; so for men to be good
by unanimity delights Him more. “Thou shalt not follow a multitude,” He
says, “to do evil.” ([Ex. xxiii.
2](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#002)<span id="vi.xxxvii-p22.14"></span>.)
“They are all gone out of the way, they are together become
unprofitable” ([Rom. iii. 12](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#012)<span
id="vi.xxxvii-p22.15"></span>), and have become as it were men singing
in concert in their wickedness. Make for thyself friends in preference
to domestics, and all besides. If the peacemaker is a son of God, how
much more he who makes friends also? ([Matt. v.
9](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#009)<span id="vi.xxxvii-p22.16"></span>.)
If he who reconciles only is called a son of God, of what shall not he
be worthy, who makes friends of those who are reconciled? Let us engage
ourselves in this trade, let us make those who are enemies to each other
friends, and those who are not indeed enemies, but are not friends, them
let us bring together, and before all, our own selves. For as he who is
at enmity in his house, and has differences with his wife, carries no
authority when reconciling others, but will be told, “Physician, heal
thyself” ([Luke iv. 23](../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#023)<span
id="vi.xxxvii-p22.17"></span>), so will a man be told in this case. What
then is the enmity that is in us? That of the soul against the body,
that of vice against virtue. This enmity let us put an end to, this war
let us take away, and then being in peace we shall also address others
with much boldness of speech, our conscience not accusing us. Anger
fights against gentleness, love of money against contempt of it, envy
against goodness of heart. Let us make an end of this war, let us
overthrow these enemies, let us set up these trophies, let us establish
peace in our own city. We have within us a city and a civil polity, and
citizens and aliens many: but let us banish the aliens, that our own
people may not be ruined. Let no foreign nor spurious doctrine enter in,
no carnal desire. See we not that, if any enemy has been caught in a
city, he is judged as a spy? Then let us not only banish aliens, but let
us drive out enemies also. If we see one, let us deliver up to the
ruler, (that is), to conscience (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxvii-p22.18"></span>τᾥ νᾥ</span>), that imagination which is
indeed an alien, a barbarian, albeit tricked out with the garb of a
citizen. For there are within us many imaginations of this kind, which
are by nature indeed enemies, but are clad in sheep’s skins. Just as the
Persians, when they have put off the tiara, and the drawers, and the
barbarian shoes, and put on the other dress which is usual with us, and
have shorn themselves close, and converse in our own tongue, conceal war
under their outward garb: but once apply the tortures (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxvii-p22.19"></span>βασάνους</span> or
“tests”), and thou bringest to light what is hidden: so here, examine
(or “put to the test,”) by torture again and again such an imagination
as this, and thou wilt quickly see that its spirit is that of a
stranger. But to show you also by way of example the sort of spies which
the devil sends into us to spy out what is in us, come let us strip one
of them, and examine it strictly at the tribunal: and if you please, let
us bring forward some of those which were detected by Paul. “Which
things,” he says, “have indeed a show of wisdom in will-worship, and
humility, and neglecting of the body: not in any honor to the satisfying
of the flesh.” (<span id="vi.xxxvii-p22.20"></span>[Col. ii.
23](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#023)<span
id="vi.xxxvii-p22.21"></span>.) The devil wished to bring in Judaism:
now if he had introduced it in its own form, he would not have carried
his point. Accordingly, mark how he brought it about. “You must neglect
the body,” he says: “this is (the true) philosophy, not to admit of
meats, but to guard against them: this is humility.” And now again in
our own times, in the case of the heretics, he wished to bring us down
to the creature. See then how he dressed up his deceit. Had he said,
“Worship a creature,” he would have been detected: but what says he?
“God” (viz. the Son and the Holy Ghost), he says, “is a created being.”
But let us lay bare for the decision of the judges the meaning of the
Apostolic writings: there let us bring him: themselves will acknowledge
both the preaching and the language. Many make gains “that they may have
wherewith to give to the poor,” unjust gains: this too is a wicked
imagination. But let us undress it, let us convict it, that we may not
be taken by it, but that having escaped all the devices of the devil,
and holding to the sound doctrines with strictness, we may be able both
to pass in safety through this life present, and to obtain the good
things promised, through the grace and mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ,
with Whom to the Father, together with the Holy Ghost, be glory, might,
honor, now and ever, world without end. Amen.

<span id="fn_850"></span>[i:851](1110042.htm#fr_850) <span
id="vi.xxxvii-p4.6"></span>

<span id="vi.xxxvii-p5"></span> This seems meant to refer to the sequel
of the passage cited, <span id="vi.xxxvii-p5.1"></span>[Rom. ix.
4](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#004)<span id="vi.xxxvii-p5.2"></span>.
“who are Israelites, to whom pertaineth the adoption and *the glory*…and
*the promises:*” then <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxvii-p5.3"></span>τοῦτο ἐποίει</span> refers to <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxvii-p5.4"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxvii-p5.5"></span>βουλόμην</span>,
indicatively, “I wished:” but <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxvii-p5.6"></span>καὶ τοῦτο</span> (mod. text omits <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxvii-p5.7"></span>τοῦτο</span>), “And this
solicitude he showed for the sake of the Gentiles also, to whom the
unbelief of the Jews might be a stumbling-block:”—unless <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxvii-p5.8"></span>καὶ τοῦτο</span> refers
to [Acts 17.3](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#003)<span
id="vi.xxxvii-p5.9"></span>, the discourse of Christ’s death and
resurrection—that the Cross might not be an offence to the devout
Greeks.

<span id="fn_851"></span>[i:852](1110042.htm#fr_851) <span
id="vi.xxxvii-p5.15"></span>

<span id="vi.xxxvii-p6"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxvii-p6.1"></span>μετὰ ἀκριβείας ἔνθα πάθος οὐκ ἦν</span>. It
is not easy to see what else this can mean. Below in the Recapitulation
<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxvii-p6.2"></span>οὐ ῥ& 192·μῃ οὐδὲ
ζήλῳ</span>.—Mod. text “With exactness they explored the Scriptures—for
this is the meaning of <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxvii-p6.3"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxvii-p6.4"></span>νέκρινον</span>—wishing from them to derive
assurance rather concerning the Passion: for they had already believed.”
The last statement, like some other additions in the mod. text, seems to
be borrowed from the Catena (Ammonius) whence it is adopted also by
Œcumenius: but this was certainly not Chrysostom’s meaning.

<span id="fn_852"></span>[i:853](1110042.htm#fr_852) <span
id="vi.xxxvii-p7.2"></span>

<span id="vi.xxxvii-p8"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxvii-p8.1"></span>πρὸς τοῦτο</span>, i.e. the working of
miracles. Not only it did not win them: they set themselves against it,
taxing the doers of the miracles with imposture and magical art,
etc.—Mod. text “For because to Him (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxvii-p8.2"></span>τοῦτον</span>, Christ) they were opposed, and
slandered Him that He was a deceiver and juggler, therefore it is that
He also reasons from the Scriptures. For he that attempts to persuade by
miracles alone may well be suspected: but he that persuades from the
Scriptures,” etc.

<span id="fn_853"></span>[i:854](1110042.htm#fr_853) <span
id="vi.xxxvii-p8.4"></span>

<span id="vi.xxxvii-p9"></span> A. B. <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxvii-p9.1"></span>οὕτω μέγα τι καὶ τοῦτο ἐστι καὶ τὸ
πᾶν</span>. C. omits this: we place it after <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxvii-p9.2"></span>ἴ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxvii-p9.3"></span>σχυσαν</span>in the next sentence, where mod.
text has it. This thought is brought out more fully below, p. 230. The
persuading men by telling them that which even with miracles was hard to
believe—a Messiah crucified!—was itself a miracle.

<span id="fn_854"></span>[i:855](1110042.htm#fr_854) <span
id="vi.xxxvii-p9.4"></span>

<span id="vi.xxxvii-p10"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxvii-p10.1"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxvii-p10.2"></span>λλ᾽ ὁ Θεὸς συνεχώρησεν</span>, if not
corrupt, must mean “but that God permitted all: i.e. that all depended
on God’s permission, not on their strength,—<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxvii-p10.3"></span>δύο ἐγένετο</span>, i.e. some believed [Acts
17.4](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#004)<span
id="vi.xxxvii-p10.4"></span>., others opposed, [Acts
17.5](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#005)<span
id="vi.xxxvii-p10.5"></span>. The sense is confused in the <span
class="c14"><span id="vi.xxxvii-p10.6"></span>mss.</span> and Edd. by
the transposition of the sentences marked *c* and *a.* In *c,* [Acts
17.2](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#002)<span
id="vi.xxxvii-p10.7"></span>is substituted for [Acts
17.4](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#004)<span
id="vi.xxxvii-p10.8"></span>, which we restore. In *b,* we read <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxvii-p10.9"></span>τῷ τε</span> (A. B.
<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxvii-p10.10"></span>τό τε</span>)
<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxvii-p10.11"></span>οἰκονομίαν εἶναι
καὶ τὸ καλεῖσθαι</span> for <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxvii-p10.12"></span>καὶ τῷ καλ</span>. The meaning is, And so
by reason of the fact that <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxvii-p10.13"></span>τὸ καλεῖσθαι</span> is itself <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxvii-p10.14"></span>οἰκονομία</span>—that
is of God’s ordering, according to His own pleasure, who are called and
who not—the preachers are not left either to think too much of
themselves when they succeed, <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxvii-p10.15"></span>ὡ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxvii-p10.16"></span>ς</span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxvii-p10.17"></span>αὐτοὶ καθελόντες</span>, nor to be
terrified by failure <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxvii-p10.18"></span>ὡ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxvii-p10.19"></span>ς</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxvii-p10.20"></span>, ὑπεύθυνοι</span>, as if they were
responsible for men’s unbelief.—Mod. text, “And that they may not think
that they did it all by their own strength, God suffers them to be
driven away (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxvii-p10.21"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxvii-p10.22"></span>λαύνεσθαι</span>). For two things came of
this: they neither etc. nor etc. So (much) was even the being called a
matter of God’s ordering. ‘And of the devout Greeks,’” etc.

<span id="fn_855"></span>[i:856](1110042.htm#fr_855) <span
id="vi.xxxvii-p10.23"></span>

<span id="vi.xxxvii-p11"></span> The “devout Greeks” would include such
as were Jewish proselytes and such as were worshippers of the true God
and attended the synagogue services, without being connected with
Judaism. The “first women” were probably female proselytes to Judaism.
These heard the Apostle with interest, but the more ardent and fanatical
Jews, reinforced by the baser element—the loungers from the market
place, made a tumult of opposition.—G.B.S.

<span id="fn_856"></span>[i:857](1110042.htm#fr_856) <span
id="vi.xxxvii-p11.6"></span>

<span id="vi.xxxvii-p12"></span> Between the Exposition and the Moral,
the original editor or transcriber has thrown together a set of
disconnected notes. These are here inserted in what seems to be their
proper connection. In the <span class="c14"><span
id="vi.xxxvii-p12.1"></span>mss.</span> and Edd, the parts lie in the
order as shown by the letters <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxvii-p12.2"></span>α, β</span> prefixed.

<span id="fn_857"></span>[i:858](1110042.htm#fr_857) <span
id="vi.xxxvii-p12.10"></span>

<span id="vi.xxxvii-p13"></span> We adopt the reading of B. <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxvii-p13.1"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxvii-p13.2"></span>κεῖνο</span>, “the
suffering;” <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxvii-p13.3"></span>τούτου</span>, “the rising again.” The
others, <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxvii-p13.4"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxvii-p13.5"></span>κείνου, τοῦτο</span>: reversing Chrysostom’s
meaning.

<span id="fn_858"></span>[i:859](1110042.htm#fr_858) <span
id="vi.xxxvii-p13.9"></span>

<span id="vi.xxxvii-p14"></span> The accusation is artfully made. They
are accused of the *crimen majestatis*—treason against Cæsar. The Jews
knew well that to accuse them of disturbing their worship or opposing
their opinions would produce no effect. To arouse the Roman feeling
against them it was necessary to prevent their teaching concerning the
Kingship of Jesus so as to make it seem to the rulers of this free city
as a treasonable doctrine against the Roman state.—G.B.S.

<span id="fn_859"></span>[i:860](1110042.htm#fr_859) <span
id="vi.xxxvii-p14.4"></span>

<span id="vi.xxxvii-p15"></span> “When they had taken security”—<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxvii-p15.1"></span>λάβοντες τὸ
ἱκανὸν</span>, a legal term—*satisfactionem accipere,* it is doubtful
if, as Chrys. supposes, Jason became surety in person. The surety was
more probably a deposit of money and had for its object the guaranty
that the peace should be kept, and nothing done contrary the Emperor and
the state.—G.B.S.

<span id="fn_860"></span>[i:861](1110042.htm#fr_860) <span
id="vi.xxxvii-p15.5"></span>

<span id="vi.xxxvii-p16"></span> Mod. text mistaking the meaning, has:
“But they indeed were persuaded, but these do just the contrary, making
an uproar among them.”

<span id="fn_861"></span>[i:862](1110042.htm#fr_861) <span
id="vi.xxxvii-p16.6"></span>

<span id="vi.xxxvii-p17"></span> Edd. <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxvii-p17.1"></span>καθάπερ γὰρ ἐν σώματι, ὅταν ἡ νόσος
χαλεπωτέρα ᾖ, πλείονα ἔχει τὴν ὕλην καὶ τὴν τροφήν</span>. Neander, *der
heil. Chrysost.* t. i. p. 2. note, corrects the passage thus, <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxvii-p17.2"></span>καθάπερ γὰρ ἐν σώματι ἡ
νόσος χαλεπωτέρα, ὅταν πλ. ἔχοι τὴν ὕλην</span>. But A. C. preserve the
true reading <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxvii-p17.3"></span>ἔ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxvii-p17.4"></span>χουσα</span>.

<span id="fn_862"></span>[i:863](1110042.htm#fr_862) <span
id="vi.xxxvii-p17.13"></span>

<span id="vi.xxxvii-p18"></span> Of the Edd. Savile alone has adopted
the true reading <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxvii-p18.1"></span>πῶς οὐ ταχέως ἐπιτρέχουσι τοῖς
σημείοις</span>, preserved by B. The other <span class="c14"><span
id="vi.xxxvii-p18.2"></span>mss.</span> and Edd. omit <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxvii-p18.3"></span>οὐ</span>.

<span id="fn_863"></span>[i:864](1110042.htm#fr_863) <span
id="vi.xxxvii-p18.7"></span>

<span id="vi.xxxvii-p19"></span> Here again Savile (with B.) has the
true reading <span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxvii-p19.1"></span>οὔπω
γὰρ</span>, the rest <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxvii-p19.2"></span>οὕτω</span>.

<span id="fn_864"></span>[i:865](1110042.htm#fr_864) <span
id="vi.xxxvii-p19.4"></span>

<span id="vi.xxxvii-p20"></span> Here (because it seems unsuitable to
refer this to <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxvii-p20.1"></span>χάρις</span>, i.e. supernatural grace, or
special miraculous interposition,) B. substitutes, <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxvii-p20.2"></span>ἀ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxvii-p20.3"></span>λλ᾽ ἵνα πεῖραν λάβωσι,
διανιστῶσαν αὐτοὺς καὶ διυπνίζουσαν καὶ εἰς μέριμναν ἐμβάλλουσαν, ἐποίει
αὐτοὺς καὶ ἀνθρώπινα πάσχειν</span>, “but in order that they may get
experience, rousing and waking, and making them take pains, (the Lord)
made them to suffer (or be affected) after the manner of men.”—Below,
for “Philippi” the same has “Athens.”

<span id="fn_865"></span>[i:866](1110042.htm#fr_865) <span
id="vi.xxxvii-p21.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xxxvii-p22"></span> <span class="c11"><span

(mod. text <span class="Greek"><span
