<span id="vi.xix-p1"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vi.xix-p1.1"></span>Homily XIX.</span>

<span id="vi.xix-p2"></span>[Acts
8:26](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#026.md),
[27](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#027.md)<span id="vi.xix-p2.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xix-p3"></span>“And the Angel of the Lord spake unto
Philip, saying, arise and go toward the south unto the way that goeth
down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert. And he arose and went.”

<span id="vi.xix-p4"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="vi.xix-p4.1"></span>It</span> seems to me, this <span
id="fr_435"></span>[436](#fn_435) (Philip.md) was one of the seven; for
from Jerusalem he would not have gone southwards, but to the north; but
from Samaria it was “towards the south. The same is desert:” so that
there is no fear of an attack from the Jews. And he did not ask,
Wherefore? but “arose and went. And, behold,” it says, “a man of
Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under Candace, queen of the
Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to
Jerusalem for to worship, was returning, and sitting in his chariot read
Esaias the prophet.” ([Acts 8:27](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#027.md),
[28](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#028)<span id="vi.xix-p5.2"></span>..md)
High encomiums for the man, that he, residing in Ethiopia and beset with
so much business, and when there was no festival going on, and living in
that superstitious city, came “to Jerusalem for to worship.” Great also
is his studiousness, that even “sitting in his chariot he read. <span
id="fr_436"></span>[437](#fn_436.md) And,” it says, “the Spirit said unto
Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot. And Philip ran
thither to him, and heard him reading the prophet Esaias, and said,
Understandest thou what thou readest? And he said, How can I, except
some man should guide me?” ([Acts
8.29-31](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#029.md)<span
id="vi.xix-p6.6"></span>.) Observe again his piety; that though he did
not understand, he read, and then after reading, examines. “And he
desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him. The place of the
Scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the
slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened He not His
mouth: in His humiliation His judgment was taken away: and who shall
declare His generation? for His life is taken from the earth. And the
eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the
prophet this? of himself, or of some other man? Then Philip opened his
mouth, and began at the same Scripture, and preached unto him Jesus.”
([Acts 8.32-35](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#032.md)<span
id="vi.xix-p6.7"></span>.) Observe how it is Providentially ordered.
First he reads and does not understand; then he reads the very text in
which was the Passion and the Resurrection and the Gift. “And as they
went on their way, they came unto a certain water: and the eunuch said,
See, here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?” ([Acts
8.36](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#036)<span id="vi.xix-p6.8"></span>..md)
Mark the eager desire, mark <span id="fr_437"></span>[438](#fn_437.md) the
exact knowledge. “And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they
went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he
baptized him. And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of
the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he
went on his way rejoicing.” ([Acts
8:38](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#038.md),
[39](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#039)<span id="vi.xix-p7.6"></span>..md)
But why did the Spirit of the Lord bear him away? (Hereby) the
occurrence was shown to be more wonderful. Even then, the eunuch did not
know him. Consequently this was done, that Philip might afterwards be a
subject of wonder to him. <span id="fr_438"></span>[439](#fn_438.md) “For,”
it says, “he went on his way rejoicing. But Philip was found at Azotus:
and passing through he preached in all the cities, till he came to
Cæsarea.” ([Acts 8.40](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#040.md)<span
id="vi.xix-p8.5"></span>.) This (Philip, therefore) was one of the
seven; for there in fact he is afterwards found at Cæsarea. It was well
and expedient therefore that the Spirit caught Philip away; else the
eunuch would have desired to go with him, <span
id="fr_439"></span>[440](#fn_439.md) and Philip would have grieved him by
declining to comply with his request, the time being not yet come. (*a*)
But <span id="fr_440"></span>[441](#fn_440.md) at the same time here was an
encouraging assurance for them that they shall also prevail over the
heathen: for <span id="fr_441"></span>[442](#fn_441.md) indeed the high
character (<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xix-p11.7"></span>τὸ
ἀξιόπιστον</span>) of the (first) believers was enough to move them. If
however the eunuch had stayed there, what fault could have been found?
\[But he knew him not\]: for this is why it says, “he went on his way
rejoicing:” so that had he known him, he would not have been (so)
delighted.

<span id="vi.xix-p12"></span>“And the Angel of the Lord,” etc.
(Recapitulation, [Acts 8.26](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#026.md)<span
id="vi.xix-p12.1"></span>.) (*b*) See Angels assisting the preaching,
and not themselves preaching, but calling these (to the work). But the
wonderful nature of the occurrence is shown also by this: that what of
old was rare, and hardly done, here takes place with ease, <span
id="fr_442"></span>[443](#fn_442) and see with what frequency! (*c*.md) “An
eunuch,” it says, “a man of great authority, under Candace, queen of the
Ethiopians.” <span id="fr_443"></span>[444](#fn_443.md) ([Acts
8.27](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#027)<span id="vi.xix-p14.3"></span>..md)
For there women bore rule of old, and this was the law among them.
Philip did not yet know for whose sake he had come into the desert:
(*d*) but <span id="fr_444"></span>[445](#fn_444.md) what was there to
hinder his learning all (these particulars) accurately, while in the
chariot? “Was reading the prophet Esaias.” ([Acts
8.28](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#028)<span id="vi.xix-p15.8"></span>..md)
For the road was desert, and there was no display in the matter. Observe
also at what time: in the most violent heat (of the day). (*e*) “And the
Spirit said unto him.” ([Acts
8.29](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#029)<span id="vi.xix-p15.9"></span>..md)
Not now the Angel <span id="fr_445"></span>[446](#fn_445.md) but the Spirit
urges him. Why is this? “Then,” the vision took place, in grosser form,
through the Angel, for this is for them that are more of the body, but
the Spirit is for the more spiritual. And how did He speak to him? Of
course, suggested it to him. Why does not the Angel appear to the other,
and bring him to Philip? Because it is likely he would not have been
persuaded, but rather terrified. Observe the wisdom of Philip: he did
not accuse him, not say, “I know these things exactly:” did not pay
court to him, and say, “Blessed art thou that readest.” But mark his
speech, how far it is from harshness alike and from adulation; the
speech rather of a kind and friendly man. “Understandest thou what thou
readest?” ([Acts 8.30](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#030.md)<span
id="vi.xix-p16.14"></span>.) For it was needful that he should himself
ask, himself have a longing desire. He plainly intimates, that he knows
that the other knew nothing: and says, “Understandest thou what thou
readest?” at the same time he shows him that great was the treasure that
lay therein. It tells well also, that the eunuch looked not to the
outward appearance (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xix-p16.15"></span>σχἥμα</span>) (of the man), said not, “Who art
thou?” did not chide, not give himself airs, not say that he did know.
On the contrary, he confesses his ignorance: wherefore also he learns.
He shows his hurt to the physician: sees at a glance, that he both knows
the matter, and is willing to teach. Look <span
id="fr_446"></span>[447](#fn_446.md) how free he is from haughtiness; the
outward appearance announced nothing splendid. So desirous was he of
learning, and gave heed to his words; and that saying, “He that seeketh,
findeth,” ([Matt. vii. 8](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#008.md)<span
id="vi.xix-p17.14"></span>.) was fulfilled in him. “And,” it says, “he
besought Philip, that he would come up and sit with him.” ([Acts
8.31](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#031)<span id="vi.xix-p17.15"></span>..md)
Do you mark the eagerness, the longing desire? But should any say he
ought to have waited for Philip (to speak), (the answer is), he does not
know what is the matter: he could not in the least tell what the other
was going to say to him, but supposed merely that he was about to
receive some (lesson of) prophecy. And moreover, this was more
respectful, that he did not draw him into his chariot, but besought him.
“And Philip,” we have read, “ran to him, and heard him reading;” even
the fact of his running, showed <span id="fr_447"></span>[448](#fn_447.md)
that he wished to say (something). “And the place,” it says, “of the
Scripture which he read was this: As a sheep He was led to the
slaughter.” <span id="fr_448"></span>[449](#fn_448.md) ([Acts
8.32](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#032)<span id="vi.xix-p20.9"></span>..md)
And this circumstance, also, is a token of his elevated mind, (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xix-p20.10"></span>φιλοσοφίας</span>) that he
had in hand this prophet, who is more sublime than all others. Philip
does not relate matters to him just as it might happen, but quietly:
nay, does not say anything until he is questioned. Both in the former
instance he prayed him, and so he does now, saying, “I pray thee of whom
speaketh the prophet this?” That <span id="fr_449"></span>[450](#fn_449.md)
he should at all know either that the Prophets speak in different ways
about different persons, or that they speak of themselves in another
person—the question betokens a very thoughtful mind. <span
id="fr_450"></span>[451](#fn_450.md) Let us be put to shame, both poor and
rich, by this eunuch. Then, it says, “they came to a certain water, and
he said, Lo, here is water.” ([Acts
8.36](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#036)<span id="vi.xix-p22.2"></span>..md)
Again, of his own accord he requests, saying, “What doth hinder me to be
baptized?” And see again his modesty: he does not say, Baptize me,
neither does he hold his peace; but he utters somewhat midway betwixt
strong desire and reverent fear, saying, “What doth hinder me?” Do you
observe that he has the doctrines (of faith) perfect? For indeed the
Prophet had the whole, Incarnation, Passion, Resurrection, Ascension,
Judgment to come. And if he shows exceeding earnestness of desire, do
not marvel. Be ashamed, all ye as many as are unbaptized. “And,” it
says, “he commanded the chariot to stand still.” ([Acts
8.38](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#038)<span id="vi.xix-p22.3"></span>..md)
He spoke, and gave the order at the same moment, before hearing
(Philip’s answer). “And when they were come up out of the water, the
Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip;” ([Acts
8.39](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#039)<span id="vi.xix-p22.4"></span>.md)
in order that the occurrence might be shown to be of God; that he might
not consider it to be merely man. “And he went,” it says, “on his way
rejoicing.” (P. 121, note 2.) This hints, that he would have been
grieved had he known: for the greatness of his joy, having had the
Spirit also vouchsafed to him, he did not even see things present—“But
Philip was found at Azotus.” ([Acts
8.40](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#040)<span id="vi.xix-p22.5"></span>..md)
Great was the gain to Philip also:—that which he heard concerning the
Prophets, concerning Habakkuk, concerning Ezekiel, and the rest, he saw
done in his own person. (<span id="vi.xix-p22.6"></span>Bel. & Dr. v.
36; [Ez. iii. 12](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#012.md)<span
id="vi.xix-p22.7"></span>.) Thence it appears that he went a long
distance, seeing he “was found at Azotus.” (The Spirit) set him there,
where he was thenceforth to preach: “And passing through, he preached in
all the cities, until he came to Cæsarea.”

<span id="vi.xix-p23"></span>“And Saul, yet breathing out threatenings
and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went unto the high
priest, and desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that
if he found any of this way, whether they were men or women, he might
bring them bound unto Jerusalem.” ([Acts
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#001.md),
[2](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#002)<span id="vi.xix-p23.1"></span>..md) He
fitly mentions Paul’s zeal, and shows that in the very midst of his zeal
he is drawn. “Yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter,” and not yet
sated with the murder of Stephen, he was not yet glutted with the
persecution of the Church, and the dispersion. Lo, this was fulfilled
which was spoken by Christ, that “they which kill you shall think they
offer worship to God.” ([John xvi.
2](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#002)<span id="vi.xix-p23.2"></span>..md) He
then in this wise did it, not as the Jews: God forbid! For that he did
it through zeal, is manifest from his going abroad even to strange
cities: whereas they would not have cared even for those in Jerusalem;
they were for one thing only, to enjoy honor. But why went he to
Damascus? It was a great city, a royal city: he was afraid lest that
should be preoccupied. And observe his strong desire and ardor (and),
how strictly according to the Law he went to work: he goes not to the
governor, but “to the priest. That if he found any of this way:” for so
the believers were called, probably because of their taking the direct
way that leads to heaven. And why did he not receive authority to have
them punished there, but brings them to Jerusalem! He did these things
here with more authority. And mark on what a peril he casts himself.
He <span id="fr_451"></span>[452](#fn_451.md) was not afraid lest he should
take any harm, but (yet) he took others also with him, “that if,” it
says, “he found any of this way, whether they were men or women”—Oh, the
ruthlessness!—“he might bring them bound.” By this journey of his, he
wished to show them all (how he would act): so far were they from being
earnest in this matter. Observe him also casting (people) into prison
before this. The others therefore did not prevail: but this man did
prevail, by reason of his ardent mind. “And as he journeyed, he came
near Damascus: and suddenly there shined round about him a light from
heaven: and he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him,
Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou Me?” ([Acts
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#003.md),
[4](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#004)<span id="vi.xix-p24.7"></span>..md)
Why not in Jerusalem? why not in Damascus? That there might be no
opening for different persons to relate the occurrence in different
ways, but that he alone should be the authentic narrator (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xix-p24.8"></span>ἀ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xix-p24.9"></span>ξιόπιστος</span>), he
that <span id="fr_452"></span>[453](#fn_452.md) went for this purpose. In
fact, he says this \[both in his oration on the stairs\], and when
pleading before Agrippa. “Fell to the earth”: ([Acts
22:6](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#006.md), [Acts
26:12](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#012)<span id="vi.xix-p25.15"></span>.md)
for excess of light is wont to shock, because the eyes have their
measure: it is said also that excess of sound makes people deaf and
stunned (as in a fit) (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xix-p25.16"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xix-p25.17"></span>ποπλἥγας</span>). But <span
id="fr_453"></span>[454](#fn_453.md) him it only blinded, and extinguished
his passion by fear, so that he should hear what was spoken. “Saul,
Saul,” saith He, “why persecutest thou me?” And He tells him nothing:
does not say, Believe, nor anything whatever of the kind: but
expostulates with him, all but saying, What wrong, great or small, hast
thou suffered from Me, that thou doest these things? “And he said, Who
art Thou Lord?” ([Acts 9.5](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#005.md)<span
id="vi.xix-p26.3"></span>) thus in the first place confessing himself
His servant. “And the Lord said, I am Jesus, whom thou persecutest:”
think not thy warring is with men. <span
id="fr_454"></span>[455](#fn_454.md) And they which were with him heard the
voice of Paul, but saw no person to whom he answered—for (the Lord)
suffered them to be hearers of what was less important. Had they heard
the other Voice, they would not have believed; but perceiving Paul
answering (some person), they marvelled. “But arise, and go into the
city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do.” ([Acts
9.6](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#006)<span id="vi.xix-p27.7"></span>..md)
Observe, how He does not immediately add all, but first softens his
mind. In the same way He called the disciples also a second time. <span
id="fr_455"></span>[456](#fn_455.md) “It shall be told thee,” etc.: He
gives him good hopes, and (intimates) that he shall recover his sight
also. “And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a
voice, but seeing no man. And Saul arose from the earth; and when his
eyes were opened, he saw no man: but they led him by the hand, and
brought him into Damascus” ([Acts 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#007.md),
[8](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#008.md)<span
id="vi.xix-p28.9"></span>):—the spoils of the devil (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xix-p28.10"></span>τὰ σκεύη αὐτοὕ</span>),
“his goods” ([Matt. xiii. 29](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#029.md)<span
id="vi.xix-p28.11"></span>), as from some city, yea, some metropolis
which has been taken. And the wonder of it is, the enemies and foes
themselves brought him in, in the sight of all! “And for three days he
neither did eat nor drink, being blinded.” ([Acts
9.9](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#009)<span id="vi.xix-p28.12"></span>..md)
What could equal this? To compensate the discouragement in the matter of
Stephen, here is encouragement, in the bringing in of Paul: though that
sadness had its consolation in the fact of Stephen’s making such an end,
yet it also received this further consolation: moreover, the bringing in
of the villages of the Samaritans afforded very great comfort.—But why
did this take place not at the very first, but after these things? That
it might be shown that Christ was indeed risen. This furious assailant
of Christ, the man who would not believe in His death and resurrection,
the persecutor of His disciples, how should this man have become a
believer, had not the power of His resurrection been great indeed? Be it
so, that the other Apostles favored (His pretensions <span
id="fr_456"></span>[457](#fn_456) .md): what say you to this man? Why then
not immediately after His resurrection? That his hostility might be more
clearly shown as open war. The man who is so frantic as even to shed
blood and cast men into prisons, all at once believes! It was not enough
that he had never been in Christ’s company: the believers must be warred
upon by him with vehement hostility: he left to none the possibility of
going beyond him in fury: none of them all could be so violent. But when
he was blinded, <span id="fr_457"></span>[458](#fn_457.md) then he saw the
proofs of His sovereignty and loving kindness: then he answers, “Lord,
what wilt Thou have me to do?” that none may say that he played the
hypocrite, he that was even eager for blood, and went to the priests,
and flung himself upon such dangers, in persecuting and bringing to
punishment even them that were in foreign parts—under these
circumstances he now acknowledges His sovereignty. And why was he shone
upon by that light not within the city, but before it? The many would
not have believed, since even there (at Jerusalem when the people heard
the voice which came from above, they said that “it thundered” (<span
id="vi.xix-p30.23"></span>[John xii.
29](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#029.md)<span id="vi.xix-p30.24"></span>,
*supra,* note 2, p. 123); but this man was authority enough in reporting
what was his own affair. And bound he was brought in, though not with
bonds upon him: and they drew him, who had expected to draw the others.
“And he eat not, neither drank:” he condemned himself for the past, he
confessed, prayed, besought God. But should any say, This was the effect
of compulsion: (we answer) The same thing happened to Elymas: then how
came it that he was not changed? (ch. xiii. *de Laud. Pauli Hom.* iv.
§1, t. ii. p. 491.) What (evidence) could be more compulsory than the
earthquake at the Resurrection, the report of the soldiers, the other
miracles, the seeing Himself risen? But these things do not compel
(belief) they are calculated to teach (it) (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xix-p30.25"></span>οὐκ ἀναγκαστικὰ ἀλλὰ διδακτικά</span>). Why
did not the Jews believe when they were told of these things? That he
spoke truth was manifest: for he would not have been changed, had this
not happened; so that all were bound to believe. He was not inferior to
them that preached the Resurrection, and was more credible, by being all
at once converted. He had no intercourse with any of the believers; it
was at Damascus that he was converted, or rather before he came to
Damascus that this happened to him. I ask the Jew: Say, by what was Paul
converted? He saw so many signs, and was not converted: his teacher
(Gamaliel, *supra,* p. 87, note 1) was converted, and he remained
unconverted. Who convinced him—and not only convinced, but all at once
inspired him with such ardent zeal? Wherefore was it, that he wished
even to go into hell itself <span id="fr_458"></span>[459](#fn_458.md) for
Christ’s sake? The truth of the facts is manifest.

<span id="vi.xix-p32"></span>But, as I said, for the present let us take
shame to ourselves (when we think of) the eunuch, both in his baptism
and his reading. Do ye mark how he was in a station of great authority,
how he was in possession of wealth, and even on his journey allowed
himself no rest? What must he have been at home, in his leisure hours,
this man who rested not even on his travels? What must he have been at
night? Ye that are in stations of dignity, hear: imitate his freedom
from pride, <span id="fr_459"></span>[460](#fn_459.md) (*de Lazaro, Conc.*
iii. §3, t. i. p. 748. c) his piety. Though about to return home, he did
not say to himself: “I am going back to my country, there let me receive
baptism;” those cold words which most men use! No need had he of signs,
no need of miracles: from the Prophet merely, he believed. (*b*)
But <span id="fr_460"></span>[461](#fn_460) why is it (so ordered.md) that
he sees (Philip) not before he goes to Jerusalem, but after he has been
there? It was not meet that he should see the Apostles under
persecution. Because <span id="fr_461"></span>[462](#fn_461.md) he was yet
weak, the Prophet was not easy; (but yet the Prophet) catechized him.
For even now, if any of you would apply himself to the study of the
Prophets, he would need no miracles. And, if you please, let us take in
hand the prophecy itself. “He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and
like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened He not His mouth: in His
humiliation His judgment was taken away: and who shall declare His
generation? for His life is taken from the earth. <span
id="fr_462"></span>[463](#fn_462.md) ([Acts
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#022.md),
[23](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#023.md),
[32](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#032.md),
[33](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#033)<span id="vi.xix-p37.1"></span>..md)
It is likely he had heard that He was crucified, \[and now he learns\],
that “His life is taken away from the earth,” and the rest that “He did
no sin, nor deceit in His mouth:” that He prevailed to save others also:
\[and\] who He is, Whose generation is unutterable. It is likely he had
seen the riven rocks there (on the spot), and (had heard) how the veil
was rent, and how there was darkness, and so forth: and all these things
Philip mentioned, merely taking his text from the Prophet. It is a great
thing, this reading of the Scriptures! That was fulfilled which was
spoken by Moses, “Sitting, lying down, rising up, and walking, remember
the Lord thy God.” ([Deut. vi. 7](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#007.md)<span
id="vi.xix-p37.2"></span>.) For the roads, especially when they are
lonely, give us opportunity for reflection, there being none to disturb
us. Both this man is on the road and Paul on the road: howbeit the
latter no man draws, but Christ alone. This was too great a work for the
Apostles: and, greater still, in that, the Apostles being at Jerusalem,
and no person of authority at Damascus, he nevertheless returned thence
converted: yet those at Damascus knew that he did not come from
Jerusalem converted, for he brought letters, that he might put the
believers in bonds. Like a consummate Physician, when the fever was at
its height, Christ brought help to him: for it was needful that he
should be quelled in the midst of his frenzy. For then most of all would
he be brought down, and condemn himself as one guilty of dreadful
audacity. (*a*) For these things Paul deplores himself, saying, “Howbeit
for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might
show all His long suffering.” (<span id="vi.xix-p37.3"></span>[1 Tim. i.
13-16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#013)<span id="vi.xix-p37.4"></span>..md)
Verily one has reason to admire this eunuch. He did not see Christ, he
saw no miracle: he beheld Jerusalem standing yet entire (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xix-p37.5"></span>συνεστὥτα</span>): he
believed Philip. How came he to behave thus? His soul was earnest (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xix-p37.6"></span>μεμεριμνημένη</span>). Yet
the thief (on the cross) had seen miracles: the wise men had seen a
star; but this man, nothing of the kind. So great a thing is the careful
reading of the Scriptures! What of Paul then! did he not study the law?
But he, it seems to me, was specially reserved, for the purpose which I
have already mentioned by anticipation, because Christ would fain draw
to Himself the Jews by inducements from every quarter. For had they been
in their right mind, nothing was so likely to do them good as this; for
this, more than miracles and all else, was calculated to attract them:
as, <span id="fr_463"></span>[464](#fn_463.md) on the other hand, nothing
is so apt to prove a stumbling block to men of duller minds. See then
how, after the Apostle, we have God also doing miracles. They accused
the Apostles after these \[miracles of theirs\]; they cast them into
prison: see thereupon God doing the miracles. For instance, the bringing
them out of prison, was His miracle: the bringing Philip, His miracle:
the bringing Paul over, was His.—Observe in what way Paul is honored, in
what way the eunuch. There, Christ appears, probably because of his
hardness, and because Ananias <span id="fr_464"></span>[465](#fn_464.md)
would not (else) have been persuaded. Conversant with these wonders, let
us show ourselves worthy. But many in these times, even when they come
to church, do not know what is read; whereas the eunuch, even in public
(<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xix-p39.8"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xix-p39.9"></span>π᾽ ἀγορἅς</span>) and
riding in his chariot, applied himself to the reading of the Scriptures.
Not so you: none takes the Bible in hand: nay, everything rather than
the Bible.

<span id="vi.xix-p40"></span>Say, what are the Scriptures for? For as
much as in you lies, it is all undone. What is the Church for? Tie
up <span id="fr_465"></span>[466](#fn_465.md) the Bibles: perhaps the
judgment would not be such, not such the punishment: if one were to bury
them in dung, that he might not hear them, he would not so insult them
as you do now. For say, what is the insult there? That the man has
buried them. And what here? That we do not hear them. Say, when is a
person most insulted—when he is silent, and one makes no answer, or,
when he does speak (and is unheeded)? So that the insult is greater in
the present case, when He does speak and thou wilt not hear: greater the
contempt. “Speak not to us” ([Is. xxx.
10](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#010)<span id="vi.xix-p41.9"></span>.md), we
read, they said of old to the Prophets: but ye do worse, saying,
Speak: <span id="fr_466"></span>[467](#fn_466.md) we will not do. For there
they turned them away that they should not even speak, as feeling that
from the voice itself they got some sort of awe and obligation; whereas
you, in the excess of your contempt, do not even this. Believe me, if
you stopped our <span id="fr_467"></span>[468](#fn_467.md) mouths by
putting your hands over them, the insult would not be so great as it is
now. For say, whether shows greater contempt, he that hears, even when
hindering by this action, or, he that will not even hear? Say—if we
shall look at it as a case of an insult offered—suppose one person to
check the party insulting him, and to stop his mouth, as being hurt by
the insults, and another person to show no concern, but pretend not even
to hear them: whether will show most contempt? Would you not say the
latter? For the former shows that he feels himself hit: the latter all
but stops the mouth of God. Did ye shudder at what was said? Why, the
mouth by which God speaks, is the mouth of God. Just as our mouth is the
mouth of our soul, though the soul has no mouth, so the mouth of the
Prophets is the mouth of God. Hear, and shudder. There, common (to the
whole congregation) stands the deacon crying aloud, and saying, “Let us
attend to the reading.” It is the common voice of the whole Church, the
voice which he utters, and yet none does attend. After him begins the
Reader, “The Prophecy of Esaias,” and still none attends, although
Prophecy has nothing of man in it. Then after this, he says, “Thus saith
the Lord,” <span id="fr_468"></span>[469](#fn_468.md) and still none
attends. Then after this punishments and vengeances, and still even then
none attends. But what is the common excuse? “It is always the same
things over again.” This it is most of all, that ruins you. Suppose you
knew the things, even so you certainly ought not to turn away: since in
the theatres also, is it not always the same things acted over again,
and still you take no disgust? How dare you talk about “the same
things,” you who know not so much as the names of the Prophets? Are you
not ashamed to say, that this is why you do not listen, because it is
“the same things over again,” while you do not know the names of those
who are read, and this, though always hearing the same things? You have
yourself confessed that the same things are said. Were I to say this as
a reason for finding fault with you, you would need to have recourse to
quite a different excuse, instead of this which is the very thing you
find fault with.—Do not you exhort your son? Now if he should say,
“Always the same things!” would not you count it an insult? It would be
time enough to talk of “the same things,” when we both knew the things,
and exhibited them in our practice. Or rather, even then, the reading of
them would not be superfluous. What equal to Timothy? tell me that: and
yet to him says Paul, “Give attention to reading, to exhortation. (<span
id="vi.xix-p44.4"></span>[1 Tim. iv.
13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#013)<span id="vi.xix-p44.5"></span>..md)
For it is not possible, I say not possible, ever to exhaust the mind of
the Scriptures. It is a well which has no bottom. “I said,” saith the
Preacher, “I am become wise: <span id="fr_469"></span>[470](#fn_469.md) and
then it departed from me.”—(<span id="vi.xix-p45.3"></span>[Eccles. vii.
24](../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#024)<span id="vi.xix-p45.4"></span>..md)
Shall I show you that the things are not “the same?” How many persons,
do you suppose, have spoken upon the Gospels? And yet all have spoken in
a way which was new and fresh. For the more one dwells on them, the more
insight does he get, the more does he behold the pure light. Look, what
a number of things I am going to speak of:—say, what is narrative? what
is prophecy? what is parable? what is type? what is allegory? what is
symbol? what are Gospels? Answer me only to this one point, which is
plain: why are they called Gospels, “good tidings?” And yet ye have
often heard that good news ought to have nothing sad in it: yet this
“good news” has abundance of sadness in it. “Their fire,” it saith,
“shall never be quenched: their worm shall not die:” (<span
id="vi.xix-p45.5"></span>[Mark ix.
44](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#044)<span id="vi.xix-p45.6"></span>..md)
“Shall appoint his portion,” it saith, “with the hypocrites,” with them
that are “cut asunder: then shall He say, I know you not: Depart from
Me, ye that work iniquity.” ([Matt.
24:51](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#051.md), [Matt.
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#023)<span id="vi.xix-p45.7"></span>..md)
Surely, <span id="fr_470"></span>[471](#fn_470.md) we do not deceive
ourselves, when we imagine that we tell you in your own mother-tongue
(<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xix-p46.14"></span>῾</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xix-p46.15"></span>Ελληνιστί</span>) these
good tidings? You look downcast; you are stunned; you are struck all of
a heap, unable to hold up your heads. “Good news” should have nothing in
it of a duty to be done, but rather should counsel what is good: whereas
these “Gospels” have endless duties to be done. And again, to mention
other things, as for instance, Except a man hate father and mother, he
is not worthy of Me” ([Luke xiv.
26](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#026)<span id="vi.xix-p46.16"></span>.md):
and “I am not come to bring peace upon earth, but a sword” (<span
id="vi.xix-p46.17"></span>[Matt. x.
34](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#034.md)<span id="vi.xix-p46.18"></span>;
[Luke xii. 51](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#051.md)<span
id="vi.xix-p46.19"></span>): and “In the world ye shall have
tribulation—([John xvi. 33](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#033.md)<span
id="vi.xix-p46.20"></span>.) excellent <span
id="fr_471"></span>[472](#fn_471.md) good tidings these, are they not! For
good news is such as this—“You shall have this and that good thing:” as
in common life men say one to another, “What shall I have for my good
news? Your father is coming, or, your mother:” he does not say, “You
must do this or that.”—Again, tell me, how do the Gospels differ from
the Prophets? Why are not the Prophecies also called Gospels, good
tidings? For they tell the same things: for instance, “The lame shall
leap as an hart.” ([Is. xxxv. 6](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#006.md)<span
id="vi.xix-p47.6"></span>.) “The Lord shall give the word to them that
preach the Gospel” (<span id="vi.xix-p47.7"></span>[Ps. lxviii.
11](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#011)<span id="vi.xix-p47.8"></span>.md):
and, “A new heaven and a new earth.” ([Is. lxv.
17](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#017)<span id="vi.xix-p47.9"></span>..md)
Why are not those also called Gospels? But if, while you do not so much
as know what “Gospels” mean, you so despise the reading of the
Scriptures, what shall I say to you?—Let me speak of something else. Why
four Gospels? why not, ten? why not twenty? If “many have taken in hand
to set forth a narrative” ([Luke i.
1](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#001)<span id="vi.xix-p47.10"></span>.md),
why not one person? Why they that were disciples (i.e. Apostles)? why
they that were not disciples? But why any Scriptures at all? And yet, on
the contrary, the Old Testament says, “I will give you a New Testament.”
([Jer. xxxi. 31](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#031.md)<span
id="vi.xix-p47.11"></span>.) Where are they that say, “Always the same
things?” If ye knew these, that, though a man should live thousands of
years, they are not “the same things,” ye would not say this. Believe
me, I will not tell you the answers to any of these questions; not in
private, not in public: only, if any find them out, I will nod assent.
For this is the way we have made you good-for-nothing, by always telling
you the things ready to your hands, and not refusing when we ought.
Look, you have questions enough: consider them, tell me the reasons. Why
Gospels? Why not Prophecies? Why duties, to be done, in the Gospels? If
one is at a loss, let another seek the answer, and contribute each to
the others from what he has: but now we will hold our peace. For if what
has been spoken has done you no good, much less would it, should we add
more. We only pour water into a vessel full of holes. And the punishment
too is all the greater for you. Therefore, we will hold our peace. Which
that we may not have to do, it rests with yourselves. For if we shall
see your diligence, perhaps we will again speak, that both ye may be
more approved, and we may rejoice over you, in all things giving glory
to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ: to Him be glory and
dominion now and ever, and world without end. Amen.

<span id="vi.xix-p5"></span> So all the <span class="c14"><span
id="vi.xix-p5.1"></span>mss.</span> and the Catena: except E. which
having already made Chrys. affirm that Philip was one of the seven,
*supra,* p. 115, and note 1, gives a different turn to this passage. “It
seems to me, that he received this command while in Samaria: because
from Jerusalem one does not go southward, but to the north: but from
Samaria it is to the south.” An unnecessary comment; for it would hardly
occur to any reader of the Acts to suppose that Philip had returned to
Jerusalem.

a barbarian—both circumstances calculated to make him indisposed to
study—add to this, his dignified station and opulence: the very
circumstance of his being on a journey, and riding in a chariot: for to
a person travelling in this way, it is not easy to attend to reading,
but on the contrary very troublesome: yet his strong desire and
earnestness set aside all these hindrances,” etc. *Hom. in Gen.* xxxv.
§1. Throughout the exposition of the history of the eunuch there given
(t. iv. p. 350–352) he is called a barbarian: so in the tenth of the
“Eleven Homilies,” §5, t. xii. 393, 394, he is called a “barbarian,” and
“alien,” <span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xix-p6.1"></span>ἀ</span><span

<span id="vi.xix-p14"></span> It is probable that this eunuch was an
Ethiopian by birth and a Jewish proselyte. It was customary for such
foreign proselytes, as well as for Jewish non-residents, to go up to
Jerusalem to worship. Others suppose him to have been a Jew, resident in
Ethiopia; but he is designated as “an Ethiopian.” The fact that those in
his condition were not admitted to full standing in the congregation of
Israel (<span id="vi.xix-p14.1"></span>[Deut. xxiii.
1](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#001)<span id="vi.xix-p14.2"></span>.md) is
not a sufficient reason for the opinion of Meyer that this man must have
been an uncircumcised heathen—a “proselyte of the gate,” since he could
occupy the same relation as native Jews in his condition. Ethiopia lay
to the S. of Egypt and Candace was queen of Meroë, the northern portion
of the country. Eunuchs not only served as keepers of the harem but
sometimes, as here, as royal treasurers.—G.B.S.

which the Catena refers the mention of the <span class="Greek"><span

“Pray what hindered, say you, that he should learn all, even when in the

disdain Philip for the meanness of his appearance: comp. *Hom. in Gen.*
xxxv. §2. “For when the Apostle (*supra,* p. 115, note 1) had said,
“Knowest thou,” and came up to him in mean attire (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xix-p17.13"></span>μετὰ εὐτελοῦς

did not think himself insulted.…but he, the man in great authority, the
barbarian, the man riding in a chariot, besought him, the person of mean
appearance, who might for his dress have easily been despised, to come
up and sit with him,” etc.

<span id="vi.xix-p22"></span> The eunuch must have heard much said about
Jesus at Jerusalem for he had been crucified but five or six years
before. In this time of persecution and excitement, discussions would be
rife concerning the Christian interpretation of prophecy. The eunuch
seems to have heard two theories concerning the prophecies (e.g. [Is.
liii](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#000)<span id="vi.xix-p22.1"></span>..md)
relating to the “Servant of Jehovah,” one that the prophet was speaking
of the Messiah (whom the Christians asserted Jesus to be) and the other
that the prophet spoke concerning himself in these prophecies, an
opinion not wholly abandoned in modern times. The eunuch’s sudden
conversion presupposes prolonged consideration of the claims of Jesus to
be the Messiah and a keen interest in religious truth.—G.B.S.

both men and women,” etc. Just the opposite to C.’s meaning: viz. “It is
not to be supposed, because he took many with him, that he had any fears
for himself: he was above all such regards. The fact is, he wished to
show them all (both the Jews at Jerusalem, and the companions of his

barbarian as he was, and alien, and liable to be puffed up with his
great authority, demeaned himself towards a man, poor, beggarly,
unknown, whom until then he had never set eyes on.…If our rulers now,
believers though they be, and taught to be humble-minded, and with
nothing of the barbarian about them, meeting in the public place, I do
not say an unknown stranger, but one whom they know, would be in no
great hurry to give him a seat beside him (in their carriage), how came
this man to condescend so much to a perfect stranger—for I will not
cease to insist upon this—a stranger, I say, one whom he had never seen,
a mean-looking person, apt to be despised for his appearance, as to bid
him mount and sit beside him? Yet this he did, and to his tongue
committed his salvation, and endured to put himself in the position of a
learner: yea, beseeches, intreats, supplicates, saying, ‘I pray thee, of
whom saith the Prophet this?’ and receives with profound attention what
he says. And not only so, but having received, he was not remiss, did
not put off, did not say, ‘Let me get back to my own country, let me see
my friends, my family, my kinsfolk’—which is what many Christians say
now-a-days when called to baptism: ‘let me get to my country, let me see
my wife, let me see my children with my other kinsfolk: with them
present, and making holiday with me, so will I enjoy the benefit of
baptism, so partake of the Grace.’ But not these words spake he, the
barbarian: Jew as he was, and trained to make strict account of places,
especially with (the Law) ever sounding in his ears the duty of
observing the Place, insomuch that he had gone a long journey to
Jerusalem, on purpose that he might worship in the place which God
commanded: and behold, all at once casting away all that he had been
used to in this regard, and relinquishing this strict observance of
place, no sooner is the discourse finished, and he sees a fountain by
the roadside, than he says, ‘See, here is water, what doth hinder me to
be baptized?’”

adds, “nor was guile found in His mouth.” After <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xix-p35.12"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xix-p35.13"></span>σταυρώθη</span> something
is wanting, e.g. <span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xix-p35.14"></span>νῦν
δὲ ἔμαθεν</span> or <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xix-p35.15"></span>κατηχήθη</span>. In <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xix-p35.16"></span>καὶ τὰ ἄλλα</span> there seems to be a
reference to the sequel in “the prophecy itself,” viz. “and the rest
which may be read in Isaiah, as that He did no sin,” etc.—A., as usual,
omits the whole passage: E. refashions it thus; “Hence He learnt that He
was crucified, that His life is taken away from the earth, that He did
no sin, that He prevailed to save others also, that His generation is
not to be declared, that the rocks were rent, that the veil was torn,
that dead men were raised from the tombs: or rather, all these things
Philip told him.” etc. so Edd.

<span id="vi.xix-p36"></span> In the quotation the N.T. follows the LXX.
(<span id="vi.xix-p36.1"></span>[Isa.
53:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#007.md),
[8](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#008)<span id="vi.xix-p36.2"></span>.md),
which but imperfectly renders the original. The meaning is obscure in
Hebrew, but the best rendering is probably that of the R.V. which
renders [Isa. 53.8](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#008.md)<span
id="vi.xix-p36.3"></span> thus: “By oppression and judgment he was taken
away; and as for his generation, who *among them* considered that he was
cut off out of the land of the living?” for which the LXX. and N.T.
have: “In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: His generation
who shall declare, for his life is taken from the earth.” It is almost
useless to inquire what the LXX. translators could have meant by this
rendering. Concerning the meaning of the first clause, there are four
theories: (1) The judgment announced by His enemies was taken away,
i.e., annulled by God (Bengel, Lechler). (2) His judicial power was
taken away during his humiliation, i.e., he did not appear as men’s
judge (Humphrey). (3) His judgment (punishment) was taken away, i.e.,
ended—by death (Meyer, Robinson). (4) The judgment due him—the rights of
justice—was withheld by his enemies (Gloag, Hackett).

<span id="vi.xix-p37"></span>The latter part of the LXX. trans.: “who
shall declare,” etc., has been understood in the following ways: (1) Who
shall declare his divine Sonship?—the reference being to the “eternal
generation” of the Son (the Patristic view). (2) Who shall declare the
number of his spiritual seed, i.e., predict the extent of his kingdom?
(the Reformers). (3) Who shall declare the wickedness of his
contemporaries, for he was put to death (Meyer, De Wette, Lechler,
Alford, Gloag). This interp. assigns to the word “generation,” the same
meaning which the R.V. gives to it in the original passage and is the
preferable view. It should be admitted that this is a probable theory of
what the LXX. ought to have meant by the words which they used; that
they did consciously mean this is far less certain.—G.B.S.
