<span id="vi.xxxix"></span> <span id="vi.xxxix-p0.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xxxix-p1"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vi.xxxix-p1.1"></span>Homily XXXIX.</span>

<span id="vi.xxxix-p2"></span>[Acts
17:32](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#032.md), [Acts
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#001.md)<span id="vi.xxxix-p2.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xxxix-p3"></span>“And when they heard of the resurrection
of the dead, some mocked: and others said, We will hear thee again of
this matter. So Paul departed from among them. Howbeit certain men clave
unto him, and believed: among the which was Dionysius the Areopagite and
a woman named Damaris, and others with them. After these things Paul
departed from Athens, and came to Corinth.”

<span id="vi.xxxix-p4"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="vi.xxxix-p4.1"></span>What</span> can be the reason that, having
persuaded (some so far as to say) that they would hear him again, and
there being no dangers, Paul is so in haste to leave Athens? Probably he
knew that he should do them no great good; moreover he was led by the
Spirit to Corinth. <span id="fr_903"></span>[904](#fn_903) (*b*.md) For the
Athenians, although fond of hearing strange things, nevertheless did not
attend (to him); for this was not their study, but only to be always
having something to say; which was the cause that made them hold off
from him. But if this was their custom, how is it that they accuse him,
“he seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods?” ([Acts
17.18](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#018.md)<span
id="vi.xxxix-p5.15"></span>.) Yes, but these were matters they did not
at all know what to make of. Howbeit, he did convert both Dionysius the
Areopagite, and some others. For those who were careful of (right)
living, quickly received the word; but the others not so. It seemed to
Paul sufficient to have cast the seeds of the doctrines. (*a*) To
Corinth then, as I said, he was led by the Spirit, in which city he was
to abide. (*c*) “And having found a certain Jew named Aquila, of Pontus
by birth, lately come from Italy”—for the greater part of his life had
been passed there—“and Priscilla his wife, because that Claudius had
commanded all the Jews to depart from Rome.” ([Acts
18.2](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#002.md)<span
id="vi.xxxix-p5.16"></span>.) For though it was in the reign of Nero
that the war against the Jews was consummated, yet from the time of
Claudius and thenceforward it was fanning up, at a distance
indeed, <span id="fr_904"></span>[905](#fn_904.md) so that, were it but so,
they might come to their senses, and from Rome they were now driven as
common pests. This is why it is so ordered by Providence that Paul was
led thither as a prisoner, that he might not as a Jew be driven away,
but as acting under military custody might even be guarded there.
(Having found these,) “he came to them, and because he was of the same
craft, he abode with them and wrought: for by occupation they were
tent-makers.” ([Acts 18.3](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#003.md)<span
id="vi.xxxix-p6.1"></span>.) Lo, what a justification he found for
dwelling in the same house with them! For because here, of all places,
it was necessary that he should not receive, as he himself says, “That
wherein they glory, they may be found, even as we” ([2 Cor. xi.
12](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#012)<span id="vi.xxxix-p6.2"></span>.md),
it is providentially ordered that he there abides. “And he reasoned in
the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks. And
when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was straitened
in the word, <span id="fr_905"></span>[906](#fn_905.md) testifying to the
Jews that Jesus is the Christ.” ([Acts
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#004.md),
[5](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#005)<span id="vi.xxxix-p7.3"></span>..md)
“And when the Jews opposed and blasphemed,” i.e. they tried to bear him
down (<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxix-p7.4"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxix-p7.5"></span>πηρέαζον</span>), they set
upon him—What then does Paul? He separates from them, and in a very
awful manner: and though he does not now say, “It was need that the word
should be spoken unto you,” yet he darkly intimates it to them:—“and
when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook his raiment, and
said unto them, Your blood be upon your own heads; I am clean: from
henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles.” ([Acts
18.6](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#006)<span id="vi.xxxix-p7.6"></span>..md)
“And he departed thence, and entered into a certain man’s house, named
Justus, one that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the
synagogue.” See how having again said, “Henceforth—” for all that, he
does not neglect them; so that it was to rouse them that he said this,
and thereupon came to Justus, whose house was contiguous to the
synagogue, so that <span id="fr_906"></span>[907](#fn_906.md) even from
this they might have jealousy, from the very proximity. “And Crispus,
the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his
house.” This also was, of all things, enough to bring them over. “And
many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized. Then spake
the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and
hold not thy peace: for I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to
hurt thee: for I have much people in this city.” ([Acts
18.8-10](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#008.md)<span
id="vi.xxxix-p8.9"></span>.) See by how many reasons He persuades him,
and how He puts last the reason which of all others most prevailed with
him, “I have much people in this city.” Then how was it, you may ask,
that they set upon him? And <span id="fr_907"></span>[908](#fn_907.md) yet,
the writer tells us, they prevailed nothing, but brought him to the
proconsul. “And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the
word of God among them. And when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the
Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to
the judgment-seat.” ([Acts 18:11](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#011.md),
[12](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#012)<span id="vi.xxxix-p9.4"></span>..md)
Do you mark why those men were ever contriving to give a public turn to
the misdemeanors (they accused them of)? Thus see here: (*b*) “Saying,
This fellow seduceth men contrary to the law to worship God. And when
Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said: If indeed it were any
wrong-doing or wicked lewdness, O ye Jews, reason would that I should
bear with you. But if it be a question of words and names, and of your
law, look ye to it; for I will be no judge of such matters. And he drave
them from the judgment-seat.” ([Acts
18.13-16](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#013.md)<span
id="vi.xxxix-p9.5"></span>.) This Gallio seems to me to have been a
sensible man. (*a*) Thus observe, when these had said, “Against the law
he seduceth men to worship God,” he “cared for none of these things:”
and observe how he answers them: “If indeed it were” any matter
affecting the city, “any wrong-doing or wicked lewdness,” etc. (*c*)
“Then all the Jews <span id="fr_908"></span>[909](#fn_908.md) took
Sosthenes the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the
judgment-seat: and Gallio cared for none of these things” ([Acts
18.17](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#017.md)<span
id="vi.xxxix-p10.6"></span>): but their beating him he did not take as
an insult to himself. So petulant were the Jews. But let us look over
again what has been said.

<span id="vi.xxxix-p11"></span>(Recapitulation.) “And when they heard,”
([Acts 17.32](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#032.md)<span
id="vi.xxxix-p11.1"></span>) what great and lofty doctrines, they did
not even attend, but jeered at the Resurrection! “For the natural man,”
it saith, “receiveth not the things of the Spirit.” (<span
id="vi.xxxix-p11.2"></span>[1 Cor. ii.
14](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#014)<span id="vi.xxxix-p11.3"></span>..md)
“And so,” it says, “Paul went forth.” ([Acts
17.33](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#033.md)<span
id="vi.xxxix-p11.4"></span>.) How? Having persuaded some; derided by
others. “But certain men,” it says, “clave unto him, and believed, among
whom was also Dionysius the Areopagite and some others.” <span
id="fr_909"></span>[910](#fn_909.md) ([Acts
17.34](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#034.md)<span
id="vi.xxxix-p12.6"></span>.) “And after these things,” etc. “And having
found a certain Jew by name Aquila, of Pontus by birth, lately come from
Italy, because that Claudius had ordered all Jews to depart from Rome,
he came to them, and because he was of the same craft, he abode with
them, and wrought: for by their occupation they were tent-makers.”
([Acts 18.1-3](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#001.md)<span
id="vi.xxxix-p12.7"></span>.) Being of Pontus, this Aquila \* \* \*
. <span id="fr_910"></span>[911](#fn_910.md) Observe how, not in Jerusalem,
nor near it (the crisis), was hasting to come, but at a greater
distance. And with him he abides, and is not ashamed to abide, nay, for
this very reason he does abide, as having a suitable lodging-place, for
to him it was much more suitable than any king’s palace. And smile not
thou, beloved, to hear (of his occupation). For (it was good for him)
even as to the athlete the palæstra is more useful than delicate
carpets; so to the warrior the iron sword (is useful), not that of gold.
“And wrought,” though he preached. Let us be ashamed, who though we have
no preaching to occupy us, live in idleness. “And he disputed in the
synagogue every sabbath day, and persuaded both Jews and Greeks” ([Acts
18.4](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#004.md)<span
id="vi.xxxix-p13.3"></span>): but “when they opposed and blasphemed” he
withdrew, by this expecting to draw them more. For wherefore having left
that house did he come to live hard by the synagogue? was it not for
this? For it was not that he saw any danger here. But therefore it is
that Paul having testified to them—not teaches now, but
testifies—“having shaken his garments,” to terrify them not by word only
but by action, “said unto them, Your blood be upon your own heads”
([Acts 18.6](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#006.md)<span
id="vi.xxxix-p13.4"></span>): he speaks the more vehemently as having
already persuaded many. “I,” says he, “am clean.” Then we also are
accountable for the blood of those entrusted to us, if we neglect them.
“From this time forth I will go to the Gentiles.” So that also when he
says, “Henceforth let no man trouble me” (<span
id="vi.xxxix-p13.5"></span>[Gal. vi.
17](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#017)<span id="vi.xxxix-p13.6"></span>.md),
he says it to terrify. For not so much did the punishment terrify, as
this stung them. “And having removed thence he came into the house of
one named Justus, that worshipped God, whose house was contiguous to the
synagogue” ([Acts 18.7](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#007.md)<span
id="vi.xxxix-p13.7"></span>), and there abode, by this wishing to
persuade them that he was in earnest (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxix-p13.8"></span>πρὸς τὰ ἐθνη ἠπείγετο</span>) to go to the
Gentiles. Accordingly, mark immediately the ruler of the synagogue
converted, and many others, when he had done this. “Crispus the ruler of
the synagogue believed in the Lord, with his whole house: and many of
the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized.”—([Acts
18.8](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#008.md)<span
id="vi.xxxix-p13.9"></span>.) “With his whole house:” <span
id="fr_911"></span>[912](#fn_911.md) observe the converts in those times
doing this with their entire household. This Crispus he means where he
writes, “I baptized none save Crispus and Gaius.” ([1 Cor. i.
14](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#014)<span id="vi.xxxix-p14.4"></span>..md)
This (same) I take to be called Sosthenes—(evidently) a believer,
insomuch that he is beaten, and is always present with Paul. <span
id="fr_912"></span>[913](#fn_912.md) “And the Lord said in the night,” etc.
Now even the number (of the “much people”) persuaded him, but Christ’s
claiming them for His own (moved him) more. <span
id="fr_913"></span>[914](#fn_913.md) Yet He says also, “Fear not:” for the
danger was become greater now, both because more believed, and also the
ruler of the synagogue. This was enough to rouse him. Not that he was
reproved <span id="fr_914"></span>[915](#fn_914.md) as fearing; but that he
should not suffer aught; “I am with thee, and none shall set upon thee
to hurt thee.” ([Acts 18:9](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#009.md),
[10](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#010.md)<span
id="vi.xxxix-p17.14"></span>.) For He did not always permit them to
suffer evil, that they might not become too weak. For nothing so grieved
Paul, as men’s unbelief and setting themselves (against the Truth): this
was worse than the dangers. Therefore it is that (Christ) appears to him
now. “And he continued a year and six months,” etc. ([Acts
18.11](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#011.md)<span
id="vi.xxxix-p17.15"></span>.) After the year and six months, they set
upon him. “And when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia,” etc. ([Acts
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#012.md),
[13](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#013.md)<span
id="vi.xxxix-p17.16"></span>), because they had no longer the use of
their own laws. <span id="fr_915"></span>[916](#fn_915) (*c*.md) And
observe how prudent he is: for he does not say straightway, I care not,
but, “If,” says he, “it were a matter of wrong-doing or wicked lewdness,
O ye Jews, reason would that I should bear with you; but if it be a
question of doctrine and words and of your law, see ye to it, for I do
not choose to be a judge of such matters.” ([Acts
18:14](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#014.md),
[15](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#015)<span id="vi.xxxix-p18.1"></span>..md)
(*g*) He taught <span id="fr_916"></span>[917](#fn_916.md) them that not
such are the matters which crave a judicial sentence, but they do all
things out of order. And he does not say, It is not my duty, but, “I do
not choose,” that they may not trouble him again. Thus Pilate said in
the case of Christ, “Take ye Him, and judge him according to your law.”
(<span id="vi.xxxix-p19.10"></span>[John xviii.
31](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#031)<span id="vi.xxxix-p19.11"></span>..md)
But they were just like men drunken and mad. (*d*) “And he drave them
from the judgment-seat” ([Acts
18.16](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#016.md)<span
id="vi.xxxix-p19.12"></span>)—he effectually closed the tribunal against
them. “Then all” (the Jews) “having seized Sosthenes the ruler of the
synagogue, beat him before the judgment-seat. And Gallio cared for none
of these things.” ([Acts 18.17](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#017.md)<span
id="vi.xxxix-p19.13"></span>). (*a*) This thing, of all others, set them
on (to this violence)—their persuasion that the governor would not even
let himself down (to notice it). (*e*) It was a splendid victory. O the
shame they were put to! (*b*) For it is one thing to have come off
victorious from a controversy, and another for those to learn that he
cared nothing for the affair. (*f*) “And Gallio cared for none of these
things:” and yet the whole was meant as an insult to him! But, forsooth,
as if they had received authority (they did this). Why did he
(Sosthenes), though he also had authority, not beat (them)? But they
were (otherwise) trained: so that the judge should learn which party was
more reasonable. This was no small benefit to those present—both the
reasonableness of these, and the audacity of those. (*h*) <span
id="fr_917"></span>[918](#fn_917.md) He was beaten, and said nothing.

<span id="vi.xxxix-p21"></span>This man let us also imitate: to them
that beat us, let us return blow for blow, by meekness, by silence, by
long-suffering. More grievous these wounds, greater this blow, and more
heavy. For to show that it is not the receiving a blow in the body that
is grievous, but the receiving it in the mind, we often smite people,
but since it is in the way of friendship, they are even pleased: but if
you smite any indifferent person in an insolent manner, you have pained
him exceedingly, because you have touched his heart. So let us smite
their heart. But that meekness inflicts a greater blow than fierceness,
come, let us prove, so far as that is possible, by words. For the sure
proof indeed is by acts and by experience: but if you will, let us also
make the enquiry by word, though indeed we have often made it already.
Now in insults, nothing pains us so much, as the opinion passed by the
spectators; for it is not the same thing to be insulted in public and in
private, but those same insults we endure even with ease, when we suffer
them in a solitary place, and with none by to witness them, or know of
them. So true is it that it is not the insult, as it is in itself, that
mortifies us, but the having to suffer it in the sight of all men: since
if one should do us honor in the sight of all men, and insult us in
private, we shall notwithstanding even feel obliged to him. The pain
then is not in the nature of the insult, but in the opinion of the
beholders; that one may not seem to be contemptible. What then, if this
opinion should be in our favor? Is not the man attempting to disgrace us
himself more disgraced, when men give their opinion in our favor? Say,
whom do the bystanders despise? Him who insults, or him who being
insulted keeps silence? Passion indeed suggests, that they despise him
who is insulted: but let us look into it now while we are free from that
excitement, in order that we may not be carried away when the time
comes. Say, whom do we all condemn? Plainly the man who insults: and if
he be an inferior, we shall say that he is even mad; if an equal, that
he is foolish; if a superior, still we shall not approve of it. For
which man, I ask, is worthy of approval, the man who is excited, who is
tossed with a tempest of passion, who is infuriated like a wild beast,
who demeans himself in this sort against our common nature, or he who
lives in a state of calm, in a haven of repose, and in virtuous
equanimity? Is not the one like an angel, the other not even like a man?
For the one cannot even bear his own evils, while the other bears even
those of others also: here, the man cannot even endure himself; there,
he endures another too: the one is in danger of shipwreck, the other
sails in safety, his ship wafted along the favoring gales: for he has
not suffered the squall of passion to catch his sails and overturn the
bark of his understanding: but the breath of a soft and sweet air
fanning upon it, the breath of forbearance, wafts it with much
tranquillity into the haven of wise equanimity. And like as when a ship
is in danger of foundèring, the sailors know not what they cast away,
whether what they lay hands upon be their own or other men’s property,
but they throw overboard all the contents without discrimination, alike
the precious and what is not such: but when the storm has ceased, then
reckoning up all that they have thrown out, they shed tears, and are not
sensible of the calm for the loss of what they have thrown overboard: so
here, when passion blows hard, and the storm is raised, people in
flinging out their words know not how to use order or fitness; but when
the passion has ceased, then recalling to mind what kind of words they
have given utterance to, they consider the loss and feel not the quiet,
when they remember the words by which they have disgraced themselves,
and sustained most grievous loss, not as to money, but as to character
for moderation and gentleness. Anger is a darkness. “The fool,” saith
Scripture, “hath said in his heart, There is no God.” ([Ps. xiii.
1](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#001)<span id="vi.xxxix-p21.1"></span>..md)
Perhaps also of the angry man it is suitable to say the same, that the
angry man hath said, There is no God. For, saith Scripture, “Through the
multitude of his anger he will not seek” (after God). <span
id="fr_918"></span>[919](#fn_918.md) ([Ps. x.
4](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#004)<span id="vi.xxxix-p22.2"></span>..md)
For let what pious thought will enter in, (passion) thrusts and drives
all out, flings all athwart. (*b*) When you are told, that he whom you
abused uttered not one bitter word, do you not for this feel more pain
than you have inflicted? (*a*) If you in your own mind do not feel more
pain than he whom you have abused, abuse still; (but) though there be
none to call you to account, the judgment of your conscience, having
taken you privately, shall give you a thousand lashes, (when you think)
how you poured out a flood of railings on one so meek, and humble, and
forbearing. We are forever saying these things, but we do not see them
exhibited in works. You, a human being, insult your fellow-man? You, a
servant, your fellow-servant? But why do I wonder at this, when many
even insult God? Let this be a consolation to you when suffering insult.
Are you insulted? God also is insulted. Are you reviled? God also was
reviled. Are you treated with scorn? Why, so was our Master also. In
these things He shares with us, but not so in the contrary things. For
He never insulted another unjustly: God forbid! He never reviled, never
did a wrong. So that we are those who share with Him, not ye. For to
endure when insulted is God’s part: to be merely abusive, is the part of
the devil. See the two sides. “Thou hast a devil” ([John
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#020.md), [John
18:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#022.md)<span
id="vi.xxxix-p22.3"></span>[John vii.
20](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#020.md)<span id="vi.xxxix-p22.4"></span>;
ib. xviii. 22), Christ was told: He received a blow on the face from the
servant of the high-priest. They who wrongfully insult, are in the same
class with these. For if Peter was even called “Satan” ([Matt. xvi.
23](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#023)<span id="vi.xxxix-p22.5"></span>.md)
for one word; much <span id="fr_919"></span>[920](#fn_919.md) more shall
these men, when they do the works of the Jews, be called, as those were
called, “children of the devil” (<span id="vi.xxxix-p23.5"></span>[John
viii. 44](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#044.md)<span
id="vi.xxxix-p23.6"></span>), because they wrought the works of the
devil. You insult; who are you, I ask (that you do so)? Nay, rather the
reason why you insult, is this, that you are nothing: no one that is
human insults. So that what is said in quarrels, “Who are you?” ought to
be put in the contrary way: “Insult: for you are nothing.” Instead of
that the phrase is, “Who are you, that you insult?” “A better man than
you,” is the answer. And yet it is just the contrary: but because we put
the question amiss, therefore they answer amiss: so that the fault is
ours. For as if we thought it was for great men to insult, therefore we
ask, “Who are you, that you insult?” And therefore they make this
answer.

<span id="vi.xxxix-p24"></span>But, on the contrary, we ought to say:
“Do you insult? insult still: for you are nobody:” whereas to those who
do not insult this should be said: “Who are you that you insult not?—you
have surpassed human nature.” This is nobility, this is generosity, to
speak nothing ungenerous, though a man may deserve to have it spoken to
him. Tell me now, how many are there who are not worthy to be put to
death? Nevertheless, the judge does not this in his own person, but
interrogates them; and not this either, in his own person. But if it is
not to be suffered, that the judge, sitting in judgment, should (in his
own person) speak with a criminal, but he does all by the intervention
of a third person, much more is it our duty not to insult our equals in
rank; for <span id="fr_920"></span>[921](#fn_920.md) all the advantage we
shall get of them will be, not so much to have disgraced them, as to be
made to learn that we have disgraced ourselves. Well then, in the case
of the wicked, this is why we must not insult (even them); in the case
of the good there is another reason also because they do not deserve it:
and for a third, <span id="fr_921"></span>[922](#fn_921.md) because it is
not right to be abusive. But as things are, see what comes of it; the
person abused is a man, and the person abusing is a man, and the
spectators men. What then? must the beasts come between them and settle
matters? for only this is left. For when both the wrong-doers and those
who delight in the wrong-doing are men, the part of reconciler is left
for the beasts: for just as when the masters quarrel in a house, there
is nothing left but for the servants to reconcile them,—even if this be
not the result, for the nature of the thing demands this,—just so is it
here.—Are you abusive? Well may you be so, for you are not even human.
Insolence seemed to be a high-born thing; it seemed to belong to the
great; whereas it belongs rather to slaves; but to give good words
belongs to free men. For as to do ill is the part of those, so to suffer
ill is the part of these.—Just as if some slave should steal the
master’s property, some old hag,—such a thing as that is the abusive
man. And like as some detestable thief and runaway, <span
id="fr_922"></span>[923](#fn_922.md) with studied purpose stealing in,
looks all around him, wishing to filch something: so does this man, even
as he, look narrowly at all on every side, studying how to throw out
some (reproach). Or perhaps we may set him forth by a different sort of
example. Just as if <span id="fr_923"></span>[924](#fn_923.md) one should
steal filthy vessels out of a house, and bring them out in the presence
of all men, the things purloined do not so disgrace the persons robbed,
as they disgrace the thief himself: just so this man, by bringing out
his words in the presence of all men, casts disgrace not on others but
on himself by the words, in giving vent to this language, and be-fouling
both his tongue and his mind. For it is all one, when we quarrel with
bad men, as if one for the sake of striking a man who is immersed in
putrefying filth should defile himself by plunging his hands into the
nastiness. Therefore, reflecting on these things, let us flee the
mischief thence accruing, and keep a clean tongue, that being clear from
all abusiveness, we may be enabled with strictness to pass through the
life present, and to attain unto the good things promised to those that
love Him, through the grace and mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ, with
Whom to the Father and the Holy Ghost together be glory, might, honor,
now and ever, world without end. Amen.

<span id="vi.xxxix-p5"></span> Here in <span class="c14"><span
id="vi.xxxix-p5.1"></span>mss.</span> and Edd. the order is confused by
the insertion of the text [Acts 17:34](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#034.md),
[Acts 18:1](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#001.md)<span
id="vi.xxxix-p5.2"></span>, and the transposition of the sentence marked
(*a*), in consequence of which the first sentence of (*c*) has been
misunderstood, as if it meant that St. Paul thought it enough merely to
sow the seeds at Athens (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxix-p5.3"></span>τέως</span> mod. text Cat. <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxix-p5.4"></span>τῶν λόγων</span>),
“because the greater part of his life was now passed.” So Cat. is
further betrayed into a misconception of the following words <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxix-p5.5"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxix-p5.6"></span>πὶ μὲν γὰρ Νέρωνος

id="vi.xxxix-p5.7"></span>ὁ</span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxix-p5.8"></span>Παῦλος</span>, as if it referred to St. Paul’s
martyrdom: and so Ben. mistakes the matter, *major’ enim pars vitæ
illius jam* (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxix-p5.9"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxix-p5.10"></span>νταῦθα</span>) *transacta erat. Nam sub

<span id="vi.xxxix-p9"></span> This would be better transposed thus:
<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxix-p9.1"></span>καὶ μὴν, φησὶν,
ἤγαγον αὐτὸν πρὸς τὸν ἀνθ., ἀλλ᾽ οὐδὲν σχυσαν</span>. Mod. text, “but
they *only* brought him,” etc. What follows is confused by the
transposition after <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxix-p9.2"></span>ὅ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxix-p9.3"></span>ρα γοῦν ἐνταῦθα</span> of the part (*a*)
beginning with the same words.

<span id="fn_908"></span>[i:909](1110044.htm#fr_908.md) <span
id="vi.xxxix-p9.6"></span>

<span id="vi.xxxix-p10"></span> The <span class="c14"><span

id="vi.xxxix-p10.2"></span>ἱ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxix-p10.3"></span>ο῞Ελληνες</span> as in some copies of the
Acts and Elz., but the best authorities Gr. and Lat. simply <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxix-p10.4"></span>πάντες</span>. We adopt
<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxix-p10.5"></span>οἱ ᾽Ιουδαῖοι</span>
from the Catena, and Chrys. evidently understood it of the Jews.

<span id="fn_909"></span>[i:910](1110044.htm#fr_909.md) <span
id="vi.xxxix-p11.5"></span>

<span id="vi.xxxix-p12"></span> Here A. B. C. insert the sentence <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxix-p12.1"></span>ὅ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxix-p12.2"></span>ρα τους πιστους κ. τ.
λ</span>. which mod. text rightly removes to the comment on v. 8, and
after it, <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxix-p12.3"></span>ὅ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxix-p12.4"></span>ρα πῶς ὁ νόμος καταλύεται λοιπόν</span>:
which unless it means, “See here the beginning of the judgment on the
Jews, the dissolution of their Law, and overthrow of their nation,” of
which Chrys. speaks in this sentence, is out of place here, and belongs
to the comment on v. 18, i.e. to the beginning of Hom. 40, which in fact
opens with these words. So mod. text understands them. “Mark how the Law
begins to be dissolved from henceforth. For this man, being a Jew,
having after these things shorn his head in Cenchrea, goes with Paul
into Syria. Being a man of Pontus, not in Jerusalem nor near it did he
haste to come, but at a greater distance.” The innovator’s meaning seems
to have been, that he shore his head in fulfilment of his vow, not in
Jerusalem, nor near Jerusalem, but at a greater distance, viz. in
Cenchrea.” But St. Chrys. is here commenting on Claudius’ edict (see
above, p. 240, on v. 2): “See here the beginning of the judgment on the
Jews: it was hasting to come, but it began not in Jerusalem, nor in
Palestine, but at a greater distance—at Rome, in this edict of the
Emperor: <span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxix-p12.5"></span>οὐκ ἐν
῾Ιεροσολύμοις, οὐδὲ πλησίον ἔσπευδεν ἐλθεῖν ἀλλὰ μακροτέρω</span>.”

<span id="fn_910"></span>[i:911](1110044.htm#fr_910.md) <span
id="vi.xxxix-p12.8"></span>

<span id="vi.xxxix-p13"></span> The sentence may be completed with: “had
spent the greater part of his life at Rome,” etc.; see above, p. 236,
but the copyist make <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxix-p13.1"></span>οὗτος</span> nom. to <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxix-p13.2"></span>οὐκ ἔσπευδεν
ἐλθεῖν</span>.

<span id="fn_911"></span>[i:912](1110044.htm#fr_911.md) <span
id="vi.xxxix-p13.10"></span>

<span id="vi.xxxix-p14"></span> To this clause, mod. text rightly refers
the comment, <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxix-p14.1"></span>ὅ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxix-p14.2"></span>ρα τοὺς πιστοὺς τότε μετὰ τῆς οἰκίας τοῦτο
ποιοῦντας ὁλοκλήρου</span>, which the original text has after <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxix-p14.3"></span>καὶ ἕτεροι τινές</span>
of xvii. 34.

<span id="fn_912"></span>[i:913](1110044.htm#fr_912.md) <span
id="vi.xxxix-p14.5"></span>

<span id="vi.xxxix-p15"></span> There is no sufficient ground for the
supposition of Chrys. that the Sosthenes here mentioned was a Christian
and the same who is saluted in [1 Cor. i.
1](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#001.md)<span id="vi.xxxix-p15.1"></span>. On
the contrary, he was the leader of the Jewish party who persecuted the
ruler of the synagogue, perhaps the successor of Crispus who had become
a Christian. The reading <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxix-p15.2"></span>οἱ ᾽Ιουδαῖοι</span> of some inferior <span
class="c14"><span id="vi.xxxix-p15.3"></span>mss.</span> in [Acts
18.17](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#017.md)<span id="vi.xxxix-p15.4"></span>
which is followed by Chrys. would easily give rise to this
misconception. The true text is most probably <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxix-p15.5"></span>πάντες</span>, meaning the officers of the
governor. The representatives of the Roman government, then, attacked
Sosthenes, the leader of the party which was persecuting Paul. Thus
their effort ended in failure. And so indifferent was Gallio that he in
no way interfered. Paul’s accusers were thus themselves beaten and the
whole effort at prosecution miserably failed.—G.B.S.

<span id="fn_913"></span>[i:914](1110044.htm#fr_913.md) <span
id="vi.xxxix-p15.6"></span>

<span id="vi.xxxix-p16"></span> <span class="Greek"><span

id="vi.xxxix-p16.2"></span>δὲ οἰκείωσις τοῦ</span>Χ. <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxix-p16.3"></span>πλέον</span>. *Sed
familiaritas Christi magis.* Ben. Chrys. said above, that the most
powerful consideration was this which is put last, “For I have much
people in this city.” The meaning here is, That there was “much people”
to be converted, was a cheering consideration: that Christ should say,
<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxix-p16.4"></span>λαός μοι πολύς
ἐστιν</span>, speaking of them as “His own,” was the strongest
inducement.

<span id="fn_914"></span>[i:915](1110044.htm#fr_914.md) <span
id="vi.xxxix-p16.5"></span>

<span id="vi.xxxix-p17"></span> B. C. <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxix-p17.1"></span>ὅ</span><span class="Greek"><span

id="vi.xxxix-p17.5"></span>ὅ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxix-p17.6"></span>τε ἐλέχθη ὥστε δὲ μὴ παθεῖν</span>, (which is
meant for emendation: “This was enough to rouse him when it was spoken:
but, that he should not suffer,” etc.) Mod. text, <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxix-p17.7"></span>ὅ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxix-p17.8"></span>τι ἠλ. φοβούμενος, ἢ οὐκ
ἠλ. μὲν, ἀλλ᾽ ὥστε μηδὲ τοῦτο παθεῖν</span>. We read <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxix-p17.9"></span>Οὐκ ὅτι ἠλέγχθη ὡς
φοβούμενος. & 244·στε δὲ μὴ παθεῖν, ᾽Εγώ εἰμι μετὰ σοῦ</span>. The
accidental omission of <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxix-p17.10"></span>οὐκ</span> may have been corrected in the
margin by the gloss <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxix-p17.11"></span>ἢ</span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxix-p17.12"></span>οὐκ ἠλ</span>. But the sense seems to be
otherwise confused by transpositions. “It is true, even the number, and
still more Christ’s <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxix-p17.13"></span>οἰκείωσις</span> of them, prevailed with
him. This was enough to rouse him. But Christ begins by saying, “Fear
not,” etc. And in fact the danger was increased, etc. Not that Paul was
reproved as being afraid, etc.

<span id="fn_915"></span>[i:916](1110044.htm#fr_915.md) <span
id="vi.xxxix-p17.17"></span>

<span id="vi.xxxix-p18"></span> From this point to the end of the
Exposition all is confused. To make something like connection, it has
been necessary to rearrange the parts, but the restoration is still
unsatisfactory.

id="vi.xxxix-p25.5"></span>δειχθῆναι</span>, Sav. <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxix-p25.6"></span>διαλεχθῆναι</span>. The
construction is <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxix-p25.7"></span>πλεονεκτεῖν τί τινός</span>. “We may think we
have got something, viz. the pleasure of having disgraced them; whereas
all that we get, in advance of them, is the being taught that we have
disgraced ourselves.”

<span id="fn_921"></span>[i:922](1110044.htm#fr_921.md) <span

<span id="vi.xxxix-p26"></span> <span class="Greek"><span

class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxix-p26.3"></span>τι ὑβριστὴν εἶναι οὐ
χρή</span>. This cannot be, “for a third reason,” or “in the third
place,” but seems rather to mean “the third party” spoken of in the
preceding sentence. Perhaps it may mean, As the judge does not himself
arraign nor even interrogate the criminal, but by a third person,
because the judge must not seem to be an <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxix-p26.4"></span>ὑ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxix-p26.5"></span>βριστὴς</span>, so there is need of a third
person, <span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxix-p26.6"></span>καὶ τρίτον
δεῖ εἰς μέσον ἐλθεῖν ὅτι</span>.…But the whole scope of the argument is
very obscure.

<span id="fn_922"></span>[i:923](1110044.htm#fr_922.md) <span
id="vi.xxxix-p26.7"></span>

<span id="vi.xxxix-p27"></span> Old text: <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxix-p27.1"></span>ὑ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxix-p27.2"></span>βριστὴς, κλέπτης κατάρατος καὶ δραπέτης· καὶ

ἐκεῖνος πάνταπερισκ. ἐκβάλλειν τι σπουδάζων</span>. But it can hardly be
supposed that Chrys. thus expressed himself. The purport seems to be
this: To be abusive is to behave like a slave, like a foul-mouthed hag.
(see p. 200.) And the abusive man, when he is eager to catch at
something in your life or manners, the exposure of which may disgrace
you, is like a thief who should slink into a house, and pry about for
something that he can lay hold of—nay, like one who should purposely
look about for the filthiest things he can bring out, and who in so
doing disgraces himself more than the owner.
