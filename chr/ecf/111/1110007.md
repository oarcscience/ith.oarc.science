<span id="vi.ii-p1"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vi.ii-p1.1"></span>Homily II.</span>

<span id="vi.ii-p2"></span>[Acts I.
6](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#006.md)<span id="vi.ii-p2.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii-p3"></span>“When they therefore were come together, they
asked of Him, saying, Lord, wilt Thou at this time restore again the
kingdom to Israel?”

<span id="vi.ii-p4"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="vi.ii-p4.1"></span>When</span> the disciples intend to ask anything,
they approach Him together, that by dint of numbers they may abash Him
into compliance. They well knew that in what He had said previously, “Of
that day knoweth no man” ([Matt. xxiv.
36](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#036)<span id="vi.ii-p4.2"></span>.md), He
had merely declined telling them: therefore they again drew near, and
put the question. They would not have put it had they been truly
satisfied with that answer. For having heard that they were about to
receive the Holy Ghost, they, as being now worthy of instruction,
desired to learn. Also they were quite ready for freedom: for they had
no mind to address themselves to danger; what they wished was to breathe
freely again; for they were no light matters that had happened to them,
but the utmost peril had impended over them. And without saying any
thing to Him of the Holy Ghost, they put this question: “Lord, wilt Thou
at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?” They did not ask, when? but
whether “at this time.” So eager were they for that day. Indeed, to me
it appears that they had not any clear notion of the nature of that
kingdom; for the Spirit had not yet instructed them. <span
id="fr_29"></span>[30](#fn_29.md) And they do not say, When shall these
things be? but they approach Him with greater honour, saying, “Wilt Thou
at this time restore again the kingdom,” as being now already fallen.
For there they were still affected towards sensible objects, seeing they
were not yet become better than those who were before them; here they
have henceforth high conceptions concerning Christ. Since then their
minds are elevated, He also speaks to them in a higher strain. For He no
longer tells them, “Of that day not even the Son of Man knoweth” ([Mark
xiii. 32](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#032.md)<span
id="vi.ii-p5.3"></span>); but He says, It is not for you to know the
times or the seasons which the Father hath put in His own power ([Acts
i. 7](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#007)<span id="vi.ii-p5.4"></span>..md) Ye
ask things greater than your capacity, He would say. And yet even now
they learned things that were much greater than this. And that you may
see that this is strictly the case, look how many things I shall
enumerate. What, I pray you, was greater than their having learned what
they did learn? Thus, they learned that there is a Son of God, and that
God has a Son equal with Himself in dignity (<span
id="vi.ii-p5.5"></span>[John v.
17-20](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#017)<span id="vi.ii-p5.6"></span>.md);
they learned that there will be a resurrection ([Matt. xvii.
9](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#009)<span id="vi.ii-p5.7"></span>.md); that
when He ascended He sat on the right hand of God (<span
id="vi.ii-p5.8"></span>[Luke xxii.
69](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#069)<span id="vi.ii-p5.9"></span>.md); and
what is still more stupendous, that Flesh is seated in heaven, and
adored by Angels, and that He will come again (<span
id="vi.ii-p5.10"></span>[Mark xvi.
19](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#019)<span id="vi.ii-p5.11"></span>.md);
they learned what is to take place in the judgment ([Matt. xvi.
27](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#027)<span id="vi.ii-p5.12"></span>.md);
learned that they shall then sit and judge the twelve tribes of Israel
([Luke xxi. 27](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#027.md)<span
id="vi.ii-p5.13"></span>); learned that the Jews would be cast out, and
in their stead the Gentiles should come in ([Matt. xix.
28](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#028)<span id="vi.ii-p5.14"></span>.md).
For, tell me, which is greater? to learn that a person will reign, or to
learn the time when? (<span id="vi.ii-p5.15"></span>[Luke xxi.
24](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#024)<span id="vi.ii-p5.16"></span>.md).
Paul learned “things which it is not lawful for a man to utter” (<span
id="vi.ii-p5.17"></span>[2 Cor. xii.
4](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#004)<span id="vi.ii-p5.18"></span>.md);
things that were before the world was made, he learned them all. Which
is the more difficult, the beginning or the end? Clearly to learn the
beginning. This, Moses learned, and the time when, and how long ago: and
he enumerates the years. And <span id="fr_30"></span>[31](#fn_30.md) the
wise Solomon saith, “I will make mention of things from the beginning of
the world.” And that the time is at hand, they do know: as Paul saith,
“The Lord is at hand, be careful for nothing.” (<span
id="vi.ii-p6.2"></span>[Phil. iv.
5](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#005)<span id="vi.ii-p6.3"></span>.md). These
things they knew not \[then\], and yet He mentions many signs ([Matt.
24](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#000)<span id="vi.ii-p6.4"></span>.md). But,
as He has just said, “Not many days hence,” wishing them to be vigilant,
and did not openly declare the precise moment, so is it here also.
However, it is not about the general Consummation that they now ask Him,
but, “Wilt Thou at this time,” say they, “restore the kingdom to
Israel?” And not even this did He reveal to them. They also asked this
\[about the end of the world\] before: and as on that occasion He
answered by leading them away from thinking that their deliverance was
near and, on the contrary, cast them into the midst of perils, so
likewise on this occasion but more mildly. For, that they may not
imagine themselves to be wronged, and these things to be mere pretences,
hear what He says: He immediately gives them that at which they
rejoiced: for He adds: “But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy
Ghost is come upon you; and ye shall be witnesses unto Me both in
Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part
of the earth.” (<span id="vi.ii-p6.5"></span>[Acts i.
8](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#008)<span id="vi.ii-p6.6"></span>..md) Then,
that they may make no more enquiries, straightway He was received up.
Thus, just as on the former occasion He had darkened their minds by awe,
and by saying, “I know not;” here also He does so by being taken up. For
great was their eagerness on the subject, and they would not have
desisted; and yet it was very necessary that they should not learn this.
For tell me, <span id="fr_31"></span>[32](#fn_31.md) which do the Gentiles
most disbelieve? that there will be a consummation of the world, or that
God is become man, and issued from the Virgin? <span
id="fr_32"></span>[33](#fn_32.md) But I am ashamed of dwelling on this
point, as if it were about some difficult matter. Then again, that the
disciples might not say, Why dost thou leave the matter in suspense? He
adds, “Which the Father hath put in His own power.” And yet He declared
the Father’s power and His to be one: as in the saying, “For as the
Father raiseth up the dead and quickeneth them, even so the Son
quickeneth whom He will.” (<span id="vi.ii-p8.1"></span>[John v.
21](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#021)<span id="vi.ii-p8.2"></span>..md) If
where need is to work, Thou actest with the same power as the Father;
where it behooves to know, dost Thou not know with the same power? Yet
certainly to raise up the dead is much greater than to learn the day. If
the greater be with power, much more the other.

<span id="vi.ii-p9"></span>But just as when we see a child crying, and
pertinaciously wishing to get something from us that is not expedient
for him, we hide the thing, and show him our empty hands, and say, “See,
we have it not:” the like has Christ here done with the Apostles. But as
the child, even when we show <span id="fr_33"></span>[34](#fn_33.md) him
\[our empty hands\], persists with his crying, conscious he has been
deceived, and then we leave him, and depart, saying, “Such an one calls
me:” and we give him something else instead, in order to divert him from
his desire, telling him it is a much finer thing than the other, and
then hasten away; in like manner Christ acted. <span
id="fr_34"></span>[35](#fn_34.md) The disciples asked to have something,
and He said He had it not. And on the first occasion he frightened them.
Then again they asked to have it now: He said He had it not; and He did
not frighten them now, but after having shown <span
id="fr_35"></span>[36](#fn_35.md) \[the empty hands\], He has done this,
and gives them a plausible reason: <span id="fr_36"></span>[37](#fn_36.md)
“Which the Father,” He says, “hath put in his own power.” What? Thou not
know the things of the Father! Thou knowest Him, and not what belongs to
Him! And yet Thou hast said, “None knoweth the Father but the Son”
([Luke x. 25](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#025.md)<span
id="vi.ii-p13.7"></span>); and, “The Spirit searcheth all things, yea,
the deep things of God” (<span id="vi.ii-p13.8"></span>[1 Cor. ii.
10](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#010)<span id="vi.ii-p13.9"></span>.md); and
Thou not know this! But they feared to ask Him again, lest they should
hear Him say, “Are ye also without understanding?” ([Matt. xv.
26](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#026)<span id="vi.ii-p13.10"></span>..md)
For they feared Him now much more than before. “But ye shall receive
power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you.” As in the former
instance He had not answered their question (for it is the part of a
teacher to teach not what the disciple chooses, but what is expedient
for him to learn), so in this, He tells them beforehand, for this
reason, what they ought to know, that they may not be troubled. In
truth, they were yet weak. But to inspire them with confidence, He
raised up their souls, and concealed what was grievous. Since he was
about to leave them very shortly, therefore in this discourse He says
nothing painful. But how? He extols as great the things which would be
painful: all but saying, “‘Fear not’: for ye shall receive power, after
that the Holy Ghost is come upon you; and ye shall be witnesses unto Me
both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in Samaria.” For since he had
said, “Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the
Samaritans enter ye not” ([Matt. x.
5](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#005)<span id="vi.ii-p13.11"></span>.md),
what there He left unsaid, He here adds, “And to the uttermost part of
the earth;” and having spoken this, which was more fearful than all the
rest, then that they may not again question Him, He held His peace. “And
having this said, while they beheld, He was taken up; and a cloud
received Him out of their sight” ([Acts
1.9](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#009)<span id="vi.ii-p13.12"></span>.md).
Seest thou that they did preach and fulfil the Gospel? For great was the
gift He had bestowed on them. In the very place, He says, where ye are
afraid, that is, in Jerusalem, there preach ye first, and afterwards
unto the uttermost part of the earth. Then for assurance of what He had
said, “While they beheld, He was taken up.” Not “while they beheld” did
He rise from the dead, but “while they beheld, He was taken up.”
Inasmuch, however, as the sight of their eyes even here was not
all-sufficient; for in the Resurrection they saw the end, but not the
beginning, and in the Ascension they saw the beginning, but not the end:
because in the former it had been superfluous to have seen the
beginning, the Lord Himself Who spake these things being present, and
the sepulchre showing clearly that He is not there; but in the latter,
they needed to be informed of the sequel by word of others: inasmuch
then as their eyes do not suffice to show them the height above, nor to
inform them whether He is actually gone up into heaven, or only
seemingly into heaven, see then what follows. That it was Jesus Himself
they knew from the fact that He had been conversing with them (for had
they seen only from a distance, they could not have recognized Him by
sight), <span id="fr_37"></span>[38](#fn_37.md) but that He is taken up
into Heaven the Angels themselves inform them. Observe how it is
ordered, that not all is done by the Spirit, but the eyes also do their
part. But why did “a cloud receive Him?” This too was a sure sign that
He went up to Heaven. Not fire, as in the case of Elijah, nor fiery
chariot, but “a cloud received Him;” which was a symbol of Heaven, as
the Prophet says; <span id="fr_38"></span>[39](#fn_38.md) “Who maketh the
clouds His chariot” ([Ps. civ. 3](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#003.md)<span
id="vi.ii-p15.4"></span>); it is of the Father Himself that this is
said. Therefore he says, “on a cloud;” in the symbol, he would say, of
the Divine power, for no other Power is seen to appear on a cloud. For
hear again what another Prophet says: “The Lord sitteth upon a light
cloud” (<span id="vi.ii-p15.5"></span>[Is. xix.
1](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#001)<span id="vi.ii-p15.6"></span>.md).
For <span id="fr_39"></span>[40](#fn_39.md) it was while they were
listening with great attention to what He was saying, and this in answer
to a very interesting question, and with their minds fully aroused and
quite awake, that this thing took place. Also on the mount \[Sinai\] the
cloud was because of Him: since Moses also entered into the darkness,
but the cloud there was not because of Moses. And He did not merely say,
“I go,” lest they should again grieve, but He said, “I send the Spirit”
(<span id="vi.ii-p16.3"></span>[John
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#005.md),
[7](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#007)<span id="vi.ii-p16.4"></span>.md); and
that He was going away into heaven they saw with their eyes. O what a
sight they were granted! “And while they looked stedfastly,” it is said,
“toward heaven, as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white
apparel; which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into
heaven? This same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven”—they
used the expression “This” demonstratively, saying, “this Jesus, which
is taken up from you into heaven, shall thus”—demonstratively, “in this
way”—“come in like manner as ye have seen Him going into heaven.” ([Acts
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#010.md),
[11](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#011)<span id="vi.ii-p16.5"></span>..md)
Again, the outward appearance is cheering \[“in white apparel”\]. They
were Angels, in the form of men. And they say, “Ye men of Galilee:” they
showed themselves to be trusted by the disciples, by saying, “Ye men of
Galilee.” For this was the meaning: else, what needed they to be told of
their country, who knew it well enough? By their appearance also they
attracted their regard, and shewed that they were from heaven. But
wherefore does not Christ Himself tell them these things, instead of the
Angels? He had beforehand told them all things; \[“What if ye shall see
the Son of Man\] going up where He was before?” ([John vi.
62](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#062)<span id="vi.ii-p16.6"></span>.md).

<span id="vi.ii-p17"></span>Moreover the Angels did not say, ‘whom you
have seen taken up,’ but, “going into heaven:” ascension is the word,
not assumption; the expression “taken up,” <span
id="fr_40"></span>[41](#fn_40.md) belongs to the flesh. For the same reason
they say, “He which is taken up from you shall thus come,” not, “shall
be sent,” but, “shall come. He that ascended, the same is he also that
descended” (<span id="vi.ii-p18.4"></span>[Eph. iv.
10](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#010)<span id="vi.ii-p18.5"></span>.md). So
again the expression, “a cloud received Him:” for He Himself mounted
upon the cloud. Of the expressions, some are adapted to the conceptions
of the disciples, some agreeable with the Divine Majesty. Now, as they
behold, their conceptions are elevated: He has given them no slight hint
of the nature of His second coming. For this, “Shall *thus* come,”
means, with the body; which thing they desired to hear; and, that he
shall come again to judgment “thus” upon a cloud. “And, behold, two men
stood by them.” Why is it said, “men?” Because they had fashioned
themselves completely as such, that the beholders might not be
overpowered. “Which also said:” their words moreover were calculated for
soothing: “Why stand ye gazing up into heaven?” They would not let them
any longer wait there for Him. Here again, these tell what is greater,
and leave the less unsaid. That “He will thus come,” they say, and that
“ye must look for Him from heaven.” For the rest, they called them off
from that spectacle to their saying, that they might not, because they
could not see Him, imagine that He was not ascended, but even while they
are conversing, would be present ere they were aware. For if they said
on a former occasion, “Whither goest Thou?” ([John xiii.
36](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#036)<span id="vi.ii-p18.6"></span>.md) much
more would they have said it now. <span id="fr_41"></span>[42](#fn_41.md)

<span id="vi.ii-p20"></span>“Wilt Thou at this time,” say they, “restore
the kingdom to Israel?” (Recapitulation). They so well knew his
mildness, that after His Passion also they ask Him, “Wilt thou restore?”
And yet He had before said to them, “Ye shall hear of wars and rumors of
wars, but the end is not yet,” nor shall Jerusalem be taken. But now
they ask Him about the kingdom, not about the end. And besides, He does
not speak at great length with them after the Resurrection. They address
then this question, as thinking that they themselves would be in high
honor, if this should come to pass. But He (for as touching this
restoration, that it was not to be, He did not openly declare; for what
needed they to learn this? hence they do not again ask, “What is the
sign of Thy coming, and of the end of the world?” for they are afraid to
say that: but, “Wilt Thou restore the kingdom to Israel?” for they
thought there was such a kingdom), but He, I say, both in parables had
shown that the time was not near, <span id="fr_42"></span>[43](#fn_42.md)
and here where they asked, and He answered thereto, “Ye shall receive
power,” says He, “when the Holy Ghost is come upon you. Is come upon
you,” not, “is sent,” \[to shew the Spirit’s coequal Majesty. How then
darest thou, O opponent of the Spirit, to call Him a creature <span
id="fr_43"></span>[44](#fn_43.md) ?\]. “And ye shall be witnesses to Me.”
He hinted at the Ascension. \[“And when he had spoken these
things. <span id="fr_44"></span>[45](#fn_44.md) \] Which they had heard
before, and He now reminds them of. \[“He was taken up.”\] Already it
has been shown, that He went up into heaven. \[“And a cloud, etc.”\]
“Clouds and darkness are under His feet,” (<span
id="vi.ii-p23.1"></span>[Ps. xviii.
9](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#009.md)<span id="vi.ii-p23.2"></span>;
xcvii. 2) saith the Scripture: for this is declared by the expression,
“And a cloud received Him:” the Lord of heaven, it means. For as a king
is shown by the royal chariot, so was the royal chariot sent for Him.
\[“Behold, two men, etc.\] That they may vent no sorrowful exclamations,
and that it might not be with them as it was with Elisha, (<span
id="vi.ii-p23.3"></span>[2 Kings ii.
12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#012)<span id="vi.ii-p23.4"></span>.md) who,
when his master was taken up, rent his mantle. And what say they? “This
Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall thus come.” And,
“Behold, two men stood by them.” ([Matt. xviii.
16](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#016)<span id="vi.ii-p23.5"></span>..md)
With good reason: for “in the mouth of two witnesses shall every word be
established” ([Deut. xvii. 6](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#006.md)<span
id="vi.ii-p23.6"></span>): and these utter the same things. And it is
said, that they were “in white apparel.” In the same manner as they had
already seen an Angel at the sepulchre, who had even told them their own
thoughts; so here also an Angel is the preacher of His Ascension;
although indeed the Prophets had frequently foretold it, as well as the
Resurrection. <span id="fr_45"></span>[46](#fn_45.md)

<span id="vi.ii-p25"></span>Everywhere it is Angels as at the Nativity,
“for that which is conceived in her,” saith one, “is by the Holy Ghost”
([Matt. i. 20](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#020.md)<span
id="vi.ii-p25.1"></span>): and again to Mary, “Fear not, Mary.” ([Luke
i. 30](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#030)<span id="vi.ii-p25.2"></span>..md)
And at the Resurrection: “He is not here; He is risen, and goeth before
you.” ([Luke 24.6](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#006.md)<span
id="vi.ii-p25.3"></span>.) “Come, and see!” ([Matt. xxviii.
6](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#006)<span id="vi.ii-p25.4"></span>..md) And
at the Second Coming. For that they may not be utterly in amaze,
therefore it is added, “Shall thus come.” ([Matt.
25.31](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#031)<span id="vi.ii-p25.5"></span>..md)
They recover their breath a little; if indeed He shall come again, if
also thus come, and not be unapproachable! And that expression also,
that it is “from them” He is taken up, is not idly added. <span
id="fr_46"></span>[47](#fn_46.md) And of the Resurrection indeed Christ
Himself bears witness (because of all things this is, next to the
Nativity, nay even above the Nativity, the most wonderful: His raising
Himself to life again): for, “Destroy,” He says, “this Temple, and in
three days I <span id="fr_47"></span>[48](#fn_47.md) will raise it up.”
(<span id="vi.ii-p27.4"></span>[John ii.
19](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#019)<span id="vi.ii-p27.5"></span>..md)
“Shall thus come,” say they. If any therefore desires to see Christ; if
any grieves that he has not seen Him: having this heard, let him show
forth an admirable life, and certainly he shall see Him, and shall not
be disappointed. For Christ will come with greater glory, though “thus,”
in this manner, with a body <span id="fr_48"></span>[49](#fn_48.md) ; and
much more wondrous will it be to see Him descending from heaven. But for
what He will come, they do not add.

<span id="vi.ii-p29"></span>\[“Shall thus come,” etc.\] This is a
confirmation of the Resurrection; for if he was taken up with a body,
much rather must He have risen again with a body. Where are those who
disbelieve the Resurrection? Who are they, I pray? Are they Gentiles, or
Christians? for I am ignorant. But no, I know well: they are Gentiles,
who also disbelieve the work of Creation. For the two denials go
together: the denial that God creates any thing from nothing, and the
denial that He raises up what has been buried. But then, being ashamed
to be thought such as “know not the power of God” ([Matt. xxii.
29](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#029)<span id="vi.ii-p29.1"></span>.md),
that we may not impute this to them, they allege: We do not say it with
this meaning, but because there is no need of the body. Truly it may be
seasonably said, “The fool will speak foolishness.” (<span
id="vi.ii-p29.2"></span>[Is. xxxii.
6](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#006)<span id="vi.ii-p29.3"></span>..md) Are
you not ashamed not to grant, that God can create from nothing? If he
creates from matter already existing, wherein does He differ from men?
But whence, you demand, are evils? Though you should not know whence,
ought you for that to introduce another evil in the knowledge of evils?
Hereupon two absurdities follow. For if you do not grant, that from
things which are not, God made the things which are, much more shall you
be ignorant whence are evils: and then, again, you introduce another
evil, the affirming that Evil (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ii-p29.4"></span>τὴν κακίαν</span>) is uncreated. Consider now
what a thing it is, when you wish to find the source of evils, to be
both ignorant of it, and to add another to it. Search after the origin
of evils, and do not blaspheme God. And how do I blaspheme? says he.
When you make out that evils have a power equal to God’s; a power
uncreated. For, observe what Paul says; “For the invisible things of Him
from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the
things that are made.” (<span id="vi.ii-p29.5"></span>[Rom. i.
20](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#020)<span id="vi.ii-p29.6"></span>..md) But
the devil would have both to be of matter, that there may be nothing
left from which we may come to the knowledge of God. For tell me,
whether is harder: to <span id="fr_49"></span>[50](#fn_49.md) take that
which is by nature evil (if indeed there be ought such; for I speak upon
your principles, since there is no such thing as evil by nature), and
make it either good, or even coefficent of good? or, to make of nothing?
Whether is easier (I speak of quality); to induce the non-existent
quality; or to take the existing quality, and change it into its
contrary? where there is no house, to make the house; or where it is
utterly destroyed, to make it identically exist again? Why, as this is
impossible, so is that: to make a thing into its opposite. Tell me,
whether is harder; to make a perfume, or to make filth have the effect
of perfume? Say, whether of these is easier (since we subject God to our
reasonings: nay, not we, but ye); to form eyes, or to make a blind man
to see continuing blind, and yet more sharp-sighted, than one who does
see? To make blindness into sight, and deafness into hearing? To me the
other seems easier. Say then do you grant God that which is harder, and
not grant the easier? But souls also they affirm to be of His substance.
Do you see what a number of impieties and absurdities are here! In the
first place, wishing to show that evils are from God, they bring in
another thing more impious than this, that they are equal with Him in
majesty, and God prior in existence to none of them, assigning this
great prerogative even to them! In the next place, they affirm evil to
be indestructible: for if that which is uncreated can be destroyed, ye
see the blasphemy! So that it comes to this, either <span
id="fr_50"></span>[51](#fn_50.md) that nothing is of God if not these; or
that these are God! Thirdly, what I have before spoken of, in this point
they defeat themselves, and prepare against themselves fresh
indignation. Fourthly, they affirm unordered matter to possess such
inherent (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ii-p31.9"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ii-p31.10"></span>πιτηδειότητα</span>) power. Fifthly, that evil
is the cause of the goodness of God, and that without this the Good had
not been good. Sixthly, they bar against us the ways of attaining unto
the knowledge of God. Seventhly, they bring God down into men, yea
plants and logs. For if our soul be of the substance of God, but the
process of its transmigration into new bodies brings it at last into
cucumbers, and melons, and onions, why then the substance of God will
pass into cucumbers! And if we say, that the Holy Ghost fashioned the
Temple \[of our Lord’s body\] in the Virgin, they laugh us to scorn: and
if, that He dwelt in that spiritual Temple, again they laugh; while they
themselves are not ashamed to bring down God’s substance into cucumbers,
and melons, and flies, and caterpillars, and asses, thus excogitating a
new fashion of idolatry: for let it not be as the Egyptians have it,
“The onion is God;” but let it be, “God in the onion”! Why dost thou
shrink from the notion of God’s entering into a body? <span
id="fr_51"></span>[52](#fn_51.md) ‘It is shocking,’ says he. Why then this
is much more shocking. But, <span id="fr_52"></span>[53](#fn_52.md)
forsooth, it is not shocking—how should it be?—this same thing which is
so, if it be into us! ‘But thy notion is indeed shocking.’ Do ye see the
filthiness of their impiety?—But why do they not wish the body to be
raised? And why do they say the body is evil? By what then, tell me,
dost thou know God? by what hast thou the knowledge of existing things?
The philosopher too: by means of what is he a philosopher, if the body
does nothing towards it? Deaden the senses, and then learn something of
the things one needs to know! What would be more foolish than a soul, if
from the first it had the senses deadened? If the deadening of but a
single part, I mean of the brain, becomes a marring of it altogether; if
all the rest should be deadened, what would it be good for? Show me a
soul without a body. Do you not hear physicians say, The presence of
disease sadly enfeebles the soul? How long will ye put off hanging
yourselves? Is the body material? tell me. “To be sure, it is.” Then you
ought to hate it. Why do you feed, why cherish it? You ought to get quit
of this prison. But besides: “God cannot overcome matter, unless he
(<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.ii-p33.22"></span>συμπλακἥ</span>)
implicate himself with it: for he cannot issue orders to it (O
feebleness!) until he close with it, and (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ii-p33.23"></span>σταθἥ</span>) take his stand (say you) through
the whole of it!” And a king indeed does all by commanding; but God, not
by commanding the evil! In short, if it were unparticipant of all good,
it could not subsist at all. For Evil cannot subsist, unless it lay hold
upon somewhat of the accidents of Virtue: so that if it had been
heretofore all unmixed with virtue, it would have perished long ago: for
such is the condition of evils. Let there be a profligate man, let him
put upon himself no restraint whatever, will he live ten days? Let there
be a robber, and devoid of all conscience in his dealings with every
one, let him be such even to his fellow-robbers, will he be able to
live? Let there be a thief, void of all shame, who knows not what
blushing is, but steals openly in public. It is not in the nature of
evils to subsist, unless they get some small share at least in good. So
that hereupon, according to these men, God gave them their subsistence.
Let there be a city of wicked men; will it stand? But let them be
wicked, not only with regard to the good, but towards each other. Why,
it is impossible such a city should stand. Truly, “professing themselves
to be wise, they became fools.” ([Rom. i.
22](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#022)<span id="vi.ii-p33.24"></span>..md) If
bodily substance be evil, then all things visible exist idly, and in
vain, both water and earth, and sun, and air; for air is also body,
though not solid. It is in point then to say, “The wicked have told me
foolish things.” ([Ps. cxix. 85](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#085.md)<span
id="vi.ii-p33.25"></span>.) But let not us endure them, let us block up
our ears against them. For there is, yea, there is, a resurrection of
bodies. This the sepulchre which is at Jerusalem declares, this the
pillar <span id="fr_53"></span>[54](#fn_53.md) to which He was bound, when
He was scourged. For, “We did eat and drink with Him,” it is said. Let
us then believe in the Resurrection, and do things worthy of it, that we
may attain to the good things which are to come, through Christ Jesus
our Lord, with Whom to the Father, and the Holy Ghost together, be
power, honor, now and for ever, world without end. Amen.

<span id="vi.ii-p5"></span> The emphatic position of <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.ii-p5.1"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.ii-p5.2"></span>ν τῷ χρόνῳ τούτῳ</span> as
well as the answer of Jesus shows that the disciples’ earnest hope and
expectation were that their Lord should, during their life-time,
personally organize a kingdom on the basis of the Jewish theocracy.
Chrys. is explicit in pointing out their incorrect conception of the
kingdom of Christ, but does not here explain the specifically Jewish
character of that conception. In the early disciples we behold the
constant struggle of the Christian spirit to break away from the forms
of Jewish nationalism.—G.B.S.

<span id="fn_30"></span>[i:31](1110007.htm#fr_30.md) <span
id="vi.ii-p5.19"></span>

<span id="vi.ii-p6"></span> Cod. C. omits this sentence here, and
inserts it below (p. 12), where it is evidently out of place. The
passage referred to seems to be [Ecclesiasticus
51.8](../../../bib/apo/sir051.htm#008.md)<span id="vi.ii-p6.1"></span>.

<span id="fn_31"></span>[i:32](1110007.htm#fr_31.md) <span
id="vi.ii-p6.7"></span>

<span id="vi.ii-p7"></span> The connection must be supplied: e.g. It was
not that this point of knowledge was too high for them; for, as has been
shown, they knew already, or were soon to know, things much higher than
this, and which their hearers would find much harder to believe. For
tell me, etc.

<span id="fn_32"></span>[i:33](1110007.htm#fr_32.md) <span
id="vi.ii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii-p8"></span> Here C. has the sentence: “Also the wise
Solomon saith, etc.” p. ii, note 1.

<span id="vi.ii-p10"></span> <span class="Greek"><span

has <span class="Greek"><span id="vi.ii-p10.2"></span>μή</span>.

<span id="fn_34"></span>[i:35](1110007.htm#fr_34.md) <span
id="vi.ii-p10.3"></span>

<span id="vi.ii-p11"></span> These illustrations, which seem to admit a
half deceptive element in our Lord’s conversations, are as little
justified by the passage in hand as by the character of Jesus. What
Jesus promises, viz.: the Holy Spirit, is not promised in order to
“divert” the disciples from their desire, but to assure to them a
greater blessing than they then knew how to anticipate. The disciples
wish a temporal kingdom with personal prerogatives; Jesus promises them
the Spirit of Truth and opens before them the life of spiritual growth
and usefulness. The illustration would have been more appropriate, had
Chrys. said: “The child persists in his crying, but Jesus quiets him by
giving him something far better than he had asked.”—G.B.S.

<span id="fn_35"></span>[i:36](1110007.htm#fr_35.md) <span

id="vi.ii-p12.8"></span>πεποίηκεν</span>, which gives no sense.

<span id="fn_36"></span>[i:37](1110007.htm#fr_36.md) <span
id="vi.ii-p12.9"></span>

<span id="vi.ii-p13"></span> Chrys. therefore explains these sayings of
our Lord (polemically against the Arians) as <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ii-p13.1"></span>οἰκονομία</span>: i.e. the thing said is not
objectively true, but the morality of all actions depends on the
subjective condition of the <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ii-p13.2"></span>προαίρεσις</span> or purpose (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.ii-p13.3"></span>παρὰ τὴν τῶν χρωμένων
προαίρεσιν γιγνεται φαῦλον ἢ καλὸν</span>, de Sacerdot. 1. 8.), so that
where this is right and good, a deception is lawful. This lax view of
the morality of Truth was very general in the Greek Church: not so in
the early Latin Church. See the two Treatises of St. Augustine, *De
Mendacio* (“Lib. of Fathers,” *Seventeen Short Treatises of St. Aug.*)
The stricter doctrine however is maintained by St. Basil, who in his
shorter Monastic Rule peremptorily condemns all <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.ii-p13.4"></span>οἰκονομία</span>, and pious
fraud (*officiosium mendacium*) of every description, on. the ground
that all falsehood is from Satan, <span id="vi.ii-p13.5"></span>[John v.
44](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#044.md)<span id="vi.ii-p13.6"></span>. and
that our Lord has made no distinction between one sort of lying and
another. Again, the monk Johannes of Lycopolis in Egypt: “All falsehood
is foreign from Christ and Christian men, be it in a small or in a great
matter: yea, though a good end be served by it, it is never to be
allowed, for the Saviour hath declared, that all lying is from the
Wicked One.” Pallad, *Hist. Lausiac in Bibl. Patr.* t. xiii. p. 965.

<span id="fn_37"></span>[i:38](1110007.htm#fr_37.md) <span
id="vi.ii-p13.13"></span>

<span id="vi.ii-p14"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ii-p14.1"></span>Πόρρωθεν γὰρ οὐκ ἐνῆν ἰδόντας γνῶναι</span>;
i.e. had they but seen the Ascension from a distance, and not been
conversing with the Lord at the moment of His Assumption. Cod. E.
transposes the clause to the end of the sentence; meaning that they
could not by mere sight have been cognizant of the fact of His ascension
*into heaven.*

<span id="fn_38"></span>[i:39](1110007.htm#fr_38.md) <span
id="vi.ii-p14.2"></span>

<span id="vi.ii-p15"></span> [Ps. civ.
3](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#003.md)<span id="vi.ii-p15.1"></span>. <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.ii-p15.2"></span>ὁ</span> <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.ii-p15.3"></span>τιθεὶς νέφει τὴν ἐπίβασιν
αὐτοῦ</span>: “Who maketh on a cloud His stepping,” or, “going.”

<span id="fn_39"></span>[i:40](1110007.htm#fr_39.md) <span
id="vi.ii-p15.7"></span>

<span id="vi.ii-p16"></span> At first sight it looks as if this sentence
were out of place here. But the connection may be thus explained: this
circumstance, of the cloud, is not idle, but very significant; and the
minds of the disciples were alive to its import, as betokening His
Godhead. True, might it not also be said of Moses on the mount Sinai,
that a cloud received him out of their sight? For “Moses entered into
the darkness,” <span id="vi.ii-p16.1"></span>[Exod. xx.
21](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#021.md)<span id="vi.ii-p16.2"></span>. But
the cloud there was because of Him, “where God was,” not because of
Moses.

<span id="fn_40"></span>[i:41](1110007.htm#fr_40.md) <span
id="vi.ii-p17.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii-p18"></span> i.e. the Angels had before used the phrase
of *assumption:* but this does not express the whole matter; therefore,
to show that it is the act of His own Divine power, they now say,
*going* and afterwards express it that He *will come*, not that He will
be sent. He ascended, as He descended, by His own Divine power. So again
it is said, “A cloud received Him:” but in this He was not passive; as
God He stepped upon the cloud: <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ii-p18.1"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ii-p18.2"></span>πέβη</span> alluding to the expression in the
Psalm above cited, <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ii-p18.3"></span>τιθεὶς τὴν ἐπίβασιν</span>.

<span id="fn_41"></span>[i:42](1110007.htm#fr_41.md) <span
id="vi.ii-p18.7"></span>

<span id="vi.ii-p19"></span> All the Editions and the Latin Versions
connect with this the following sentence: “Much more would they have
said now, Dost Thou at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?” But it
is evident, that at this point begins the recapitulation, or renewed
exposition. It is in fact a peculiarity of these Discourses, that Chrys.
having gone through the exposition of the text, often, as here, goes
over the same ground again, usually with some such formula as, “But let
us look through what has been said from the beginning.”

<span id="fn_42"></span>[i:43](1110007.htm#fr_42.md) <span
id="vi.ii-p20.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii-p21"></span> The reference here must be to such parables
as: “The Sower,” “The Leaven,” “The Grain of Mustard Seed.” ([Matt.
xiii. 1-43](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#001.md)<span
id="vi.ii-p21.1"></span>), and the parable of the Growing Seed (<span
id="vi.ii-p21.2"></span>[Mark iv.
26-29](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#026)<span id="vi.ii-p21.3"></span>.md),
all of which seem to represent the progress of his truth as a long and
slow development. To these might be added such expressions as <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.ii-p21.4"></span>ἕ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.ii-p21.5"></span>ως τῆς συντελείας τοῦ αἰ&
242·νος</span> ([Matt. xxviii. 20](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#020.md)<span

<span id="vi.ii-p22"></span> This sentence is from the later recension.

<span id="fn_44"></span>[i:45](1110007.htm#fr_44.md) <span
id="vi.ii-p22.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii-p23"></span> The text of these Homilies is often greatly
confused by the omission, especially in the recapitulations, of the
words on which Chrys. is commenting.

<span id="fn_45"></span>[i:46](1110007.htm#fr_45.md) <span
id="vi.ii-p23.7"></span>

<span id="vi.ii-p24"></span> Here Erasmus has followed another reading
(of E.), the very reverse in sense; “And if indeed the Prophets did not
foretell this, be not astonished, for it was superfluous to say any
thing individually about this, being necessarily involved in the idea of
the resurrection, (<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.ii-p24.1"></span>τῇ
ἀναστάσει συννοουμένης</span>).”

<span id="fn_46"></span>[i:47](1110007.htm#fr_46.md) <span
id="vi.ii-p25.6"></span>

<span id="vi.ii-p26"></span> In the later recension it is added: “but is
declaratory of His love towards them, and of their election, and that He
will not leave those whom He has chosen.”

<span id="fn_47"></span>[i:48](1110007.htm#fr_47.md) <span

<span id="vi.ii-p28"></span> The emphasis of the <span

class="Greek"><span id="vi.ii-p28.2"></span>ὃ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.ii-p28.3"></span>ν τρόπον</span> is better
preserved if we interpret them to mean *visibly,* or with the
accompaniment of a cloud, in reference to the <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ii-p28.4"></span>νεφέλη</span> (9), rather than merely (as
Chrys.) “with a body.” They had not raised the question as to his coming
with or without a body. What they wanted to know was whether he was
coming in such a way that they could recognize him.—G.B.S.

<span id="fn_49"></span>[i:50](1110007.htm#fr_49.md) <span
id="vi.ii-p29.7"></span>

<span id="vi.ii-p30"></span> The text in both classes of manuscripts,
and in the Edd., needs reformation. The argument is, If good and evil
be, as the Manichæans say, both self-subsistent, then evil must subsist
for ever. For if, as they affirm, God cannot create out of nothing,
neither can He change a thing into its opposite; nay, much less, for
this is harder than that. In E. (the text of the Edd.) the reading is,
<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.ii-p30.1"></span>το φυσει κακον καλον
καλον ποι῾σαι (ει γε τι εστι καθὗ υμα¨ γαρ λεγω: φυσει γαρ ουδεν εσπι
ποι῾σαι κακον καλου συνεργον) ῾ το εξ ουκ οντων</span>: which as usual
in this <span class="c14"><span id="vi.ii-p30.2"></span>ms</span>. is an
attempt to explain the meaning, but is not what the context requires. in
C. A. (the original text) <span class="Greek"><span

Deum, quod, si nobis contingat, revera turpe futurum sit? Ben.
Quandoquidem si in nobis fiat, vere turpe est*. i.e. For, that same
which, if it take place in us, is indeed shocking \[how should it not be
so in God?\]. The exclamation, <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ii-p33.15"></span>Εἴδετε συρφετὸν ἀσεβείας!</span> seems to imply
either that <span class="Greek"><span

id="vi.ii-p33.17"></span>ντως αἰσχρόν</span> is part of the Manichæan’s
reply, or that something is omitted. Perhaps the reporter wrote, <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.ii-p33.18"></span>τὸ δὲ σ. ὅντως
αἰσχρόν</span>, meaning <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ii-p33.19"></span>σῶμα</span>: “But the body, etc.” <span

class="Greek"><span id="vi.ii-p33.21"></span>Αν εἰς ἡμᾶς γένηται</span>
can hardly be, as taken by Erasm., *quod si nobis contingat,* i.e. that
our substance should migrate into plants, etc. but rather, if it be into
us that this (embodying of the Divine Substance) takes place. For
illustration of the Manichæan tenets here alluded to, comp. Euod. *de
Fid. adv. Manich.* §35. (*Opp.* St. Augustin., Append. t. viii. Ben.)
*Non Deus Manichæi luctum pateretur de partis suæ abscissione vel
amissione; quam partem dicunt quum in fructibus vel in herbis fuerit, id
est, in melone, vel beta, vel talibus rebus, et principium suum et
medietatem et finem nosse, cum autem ad carnem venerit omnem
intelligentiam amittere; ut propterea magister hominibus missus sit,
quia stulta in illis facta est pars Dei,* etc “Then the God of the
Manichæan would not suffer grief in consequence of the cutting off or
loss of part of his substance; which part, they say, if it be in fruits
or in herbs, as in the melon or beet or such-like, knows its beginning
and middle and end; but when it comes to flesh, loses all intelligence:
so that the reason why the Teacher was sent to men was, because in them
the particle of God was stultified, etc.” And *Commonitor, de recip.
Manich.* Art. 3. (ibid.) *ut credatur pars Dei polluta teneri in
cucumeribus et melonibus et radiculis et porris et quibusque vilissimis
herbulis,* etc.
