<span id="vii.xxxi"></span> <span id="vii.xxxi-p0.1"></span>

<span id="vii.xxxi-p1"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vii.xxxi-p1.1"></span>Homily XXIX.</span>

<span id="vii.xxxi-p2"></span>[Rom. XV.
14](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#014.md)<span id="vii.xxxi-p2.1"></span>

<span id="vii.xxxi-p3"></span>“And I myself also am persuaded of you, my
brethren, that ye also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge,
able also to admonish one another.” (So most: S. Chrys. “others.”)

<span id="vii.xxxi-p4"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="vii.xxxi-p4.1"></span>He</span> had said, “Inasmuch as I am the
Apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office.” ([Rom. xi.
13](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#013)<span id="vii.xxxi-p4.2"></span>..md)
He had said, “Take heed lest He also spare not thee.” ([Rom.
11.21](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#021.md)<span
id="vii.xxxi-p4.3"></span>.) He had said, “Be not wise in your own
conceits” ([Rom. 12.16](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#016.md)<span
id="vii.xxxi-p4.4"></span>); and again, “Why dost thou judge thy
brother?” ([Rom. 14.10](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#010.md)<span
id="vii.xxxi-p4.5"></span>) And, “Who art thou that judgest another
man’s servant?” ([Rom. 14.4](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#004.md)<span
id="vii.xxxi-p4.6"></span>.) And several other like things besides.
Since then he had often made his language somewhat harsh, he now speaks
kindly (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xxxi-p4.7"></span>θεραπεύει</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xxxi-p4.8"></span>)</span>. And what he said in the beginning,
that he doth in the end also. At the beginning he said, “I thank my God
for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.”
([Rom. 1.8](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#008.md)<span
id="vii.xxxi-p4.9"></span>.) But here he says, “I am persuaded that ye
also are full of goodness, being able also to admonish others;” and this
is more than the former. And he does not say, I have heard, but, “I am
persuaded,” and have no need to hear, from others. And, “I myself,” that
is, I that rebuke, that accuse you. That “ye are full of goodness,” this
applies to the exhortation lately given. As if he said, It was not as if
you were cruel, or haters of your brethren, that I gave you that
exhortation, to receive, and not to neglect, and not to destroy “the
work of God.” For I am aware that “ye are full of goodness.” But he
seems to me here to be calling their virtue perfect. And he does not say
ye have, but “ye are full of.” And the sequel is with the same
intensitives: “filled with all knowledge.” For suppose they had been
affectionate, but yet did not know how to treat those they loved
properly. This was why he added, “all knowledge. Able to admonish
others,” not to learn only, but also to teach.

<span id="vii.xxxi-p5"></span>[Rom.
15.15](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#015.md)<span id="vii.xxxi-p5.1"></span>.
“Nevertheless, I have written the more boldly unto you in some sort.”

<span id="vii.xxxi-p6"></span>Observe the lowly-mindedness of Paul,
observe his wisdom, how he gave a deep cut in the former part, and then
when he had succeeded in what he wished, how he uses much kindliness
next. For even without what he has said, this very confession of his
having been bold were enough to unstring their vehemency. And this he
does in writing to the Hebrews also, speaking as follows, “But, beloved,
I am persuaded better things of you, and things which belong unto
salvation, though we thus speak.” (<span id="vii.xxxi-p6.1"></span>[Heb.
vi. 9](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#009.md)<span
id="vii.xxxi-p6.2"></span>.) And to the Corinthians again, “Now I praise
you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep the
ordinances, as I delivered them to you.” ([1 Cor. xi.
2](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#002)<span id="vii.xxxi-p6.3"></span>..md)
And in writing to the Galatians he says, “I have confidence in you, that
ye will be none otherwise minded.” ([Gal. v.
10](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#010)<span id="vii.xxxi-p6.4"></span>..md)
And in all parts of his Epistles one may find this to be frequently
observed. But here even in a greater degree. For they were in a higher
rank, and there was need to bring down their fastidious spirit, not by
astringents only, but by laxatives also. For he does this in different
ways. Wherefore he says in this place too, “I have written the more
boldly unto you,” and with this even he is not satisfied, but has added,
“in some sort,” that is, gently; and even here he does not pause, but
what does he say? “As putting you in mind.” <span
id="fr_1639"></span>[1640](#fn_1639.md) And he does not say as teaching,
nor simply putting in mind, (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xxxi-p7.8"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xxxi-p7.9"></span>ναμιμνήσκων</span>) but he uses a word (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.xxxi-p7.10"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.xxxi-p7.11"></span>παναμιμνήσκων</span>)
which means putting you in mind in a quiet way. Observe the end falling
in with the introduction. For as in that passage he said, “that your
faith is made known in all the world.” (<span
id="vii.xxxi-p7.12"></span>[Rom. i.
8](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#008)<span id="vii.xxxi-p7.13"></span>..md)
So in the end of the Epistle also, “For your obedience hath reached unto
all.” ([Rom. 16.19](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#019.md)<span
id="vii.xxxi-p7.14"></span>.) And as in the beginning he wrote, “For I
long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the
end that ye may be established; that is, that I may be comforted
together with you” ([Rom. 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#011.md),
[12](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#012)<span id="vii.xxxi-p7.15"></span>.md);
so here also he said, “As putting you in mind.” And having come down
from the seat of the master, both there and here, he speaks to them as
brethren and friends of equal rank. And this is quite a Teacher’s duty,
to give his address that variety which is profitable to the hearers. See
then how after saying, “I have written the more boldly,” and, “in some
sort,” and, “as putting you in mind,” he was not satisfied even with
these, but making his language still more lowly, he proceeds:

<span id="vii.xxxi-p8"></span>“Because of the grace that is given me of
God.” As he said at the beginning, “I am a debtor.” (<span
id="vii.xxxi-p8.1"></span>[Rom. i.
14](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#014)<span id="vii.xxxi-p8.2"></span>..md)
As if he had said, I have not snatched at the honor for myself, neither
was I first to leap forward to it, but God commanded this, and this too
according unto grace, not as if He had separated me for this office
because I deserved it. Do not ye then be exasperated, since it is not I
that raise myself up, but it is God that enjoins it. And as he there
says, “whom I serve in the Gospel of His Son” ([Rom.
1.9](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#009)<span id="vii.xxxi-p8.3"></span>.md),
so also here, after saying, “because of the grace given unto me by God,”
he adds,

<span id="vii.xxxi-p9"></span>[Rom.
15.16](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#016.md)<span id="vii.xxxi-p9.1"></span>.
“That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles,
ministering (ἱερουργοὕντα) the Gospel of God.”

<span id="vii.xxxi-p10"></span>For after his abundant proof of his
statements, he draws his discourse to a more lofty tone, not speaking of
mere service, as in the beginning, but of service and priestly
ministering (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xxxi-p10.1"></span>λειτουργίαν καί ὶερουργίαν</span>). For to me
this is a priesthood, this preaching and declaring. This is the
sacrifice I bring. Now no one will find fault with a priest, for being
anxious to offer the sacrifice without blemish. And he says this at once
to elevate (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xxxi-p10.2"></span>πτερὥν</span>) their thoughts, and show them
that they are a sacrifice, and in apology for his own part in the
matter, because he was appointed to this office. For my knife, he says,
is the Gospel, the word of the preaching. And the cause is not that I
may be glorified, not that I may appear conspicuous, but that the
“offering up (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xxxi-p10.3"></span>προσφορὰ</span>) of the Gentiles may be
acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost.”

<span id="vii.xxxi-p11"></span>That is, that the souls of those that are
taught by me, may be accepted. For it was not so much to honor me, that
God led me to this pitch, as out of a concern for you. And how are they
to become acceptable? In the Holy Ghost. For there is need not only of
faith, but also of a spiritual way of life, that we may keep the Spirit
that was given once for all. For it is not wood and fire, nor altar and
knife, but the Spirit that is all in us. <span
id="fr_1640"></span>[1641](#fn_1640.md) For this cause, I take all means to
prevent that Fire from being extinguished, as I have been also enjoined
to do. Why then do you speak to those that need it not? This is just the
reason why I do not teach you, but put you in mind, he replies. As the
priest stands by stirring up the fire, so I do, rousing up your
ready-mindedness. And observe, he does not say, “that the offering up
of” you “may be” etc. but “of the Gentiles.” But when he says of the
Gentiles, he means the whole world, the land, and the whole sea, to take
down their haughtiness, that they might not disdain to have him for a
teacher, who was putting himself forth (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xxxi-p12.3"></span>τεινόμενον</span>) to the very end of the
world. As he said in the beginning, “as among the other Gentiles also, I
am a debtor to Greeks, and also to barbarians, to wise, and to foolish.”
(<span id="vii.xxxi-p12.4"></span>[Rom.
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#013.md),
[14](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#014.md)<span id="vii.xxxi-p12.5"></span>,
see p. 347.)

<span id="vii.xxxi-p13"></span>[Rom.
15.17](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#017.md)<span
id="vii.xxxi-p13.1"></span>. “I have therefore whereof I may glory,
through Jesus Christ, in those things which pertain to God.”

<span id="vii.xxxi-p14"></span>Inasmuch as he had humbled himself
exceedingly, he again raised his style, doing this also for their sakes,
lest he should seem to become readily an object of contempt. And while
he raises himself, he remembers his own proper temper, and says, “I have
therefore whereof to glory.” I glory, he means, not in myself, not in
our zeal, but in the “grace of God.”

<span id="vii.xxxi-p15"></span>[Rom.
15.18](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#018.md)<span
id="vii.xxxi-p15.1"></span>. “For I will not dare to speak of any of
those things which Christ hath not wrought by me, to make Gentiles
obedient by word and deed, through mighty signs and wonders, by the
power of the Spirit of God.” <span id="fr_1641"></span>[1642](#fn_1641.md)

<span id="vii.xxxi-p17"></span>And none, he means, can say that my words
are a mere boast. For of this priestly ministry of mine, the signs that
I have, and the proofs of the appointment too, are many. Not the long
garment (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xxxi-p17.1"></span>ποδήρης</span>) and the bells as they of old,
nor the mitre and the turban (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xxxi-p17.2"></span>κίδαρις</span>), but signs and wonders, far
more awful than these. Nor can it be said that I have been entrusted
indeed with the charge, but yet have not executed it. Or rather, it is
not I that have executed, but Christ. Wherefore also it is in Him that I
boast, not about common things, but about spiritual. And this is the
force of, “in things which pertain to God.” For that I have accomplished
the purpose for which I was sent, and that my words are not mere boast,
the miracles, and the obedience of the Gentiles show. “For I will not
dare to speak of any of those things which Christ hath not wrought by
me, to make the Gentiles obedient by word and deed, through signs and
wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God.” See how violently he tries
to show that the whole is God’s doing, and nothing his own. For whether
I speak anything, or do anything, or work miracles, He doth all of them,
the Holy Spirit all. And this he says to show the dignity of the Holy
Spirit also. See how these things are more wondrous and more awful than
those of old, the sacrifice, the offering, the symbols. For when he
says, “in word and deed, through mighty signs and wonders,” he means
this, the doctrine, the system (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xxxi-p17.3"></span>φιλοσοφίαν</span>) relating to the Kingdom,
the exhibition of actions and conversation, the dead that were raised,
the devils that were cast out, and the blind that were healed, and the
lame that leaped, and the other marvellous acts, all whereof the Holy
Spirit wrought in us. Then the proof of these things (since all this is
yet but an assertion) is the multitude of the disciples. Wherefore he
adds, “So that from Jerusalem, and round about unto Illyricum, I have
fully preached the Gospel of Christ.” Count up then cities, and places,
and nations, and peoples, not those under the Romans only, but those
also under barbarians. For I would not have you go the whole way through
Phœnicia, and Syria, and the Cilicians, and Cappadocians, but reckon up
also the parts behind, <span id="fr_1642"></span>[1643](#fn_1642.md) the
country of the Saracens, and Persians, and Armenians, and that of the
other savage nations. For this is why he said, “round about,” that you
might not only go through the direct high road, but that you should run
over the whole, even the southern part of Asia in your mind. And as he
ran over miracles thick as snow, in a single word, by saying, “through
mighty signs and wonders,” so he has comprehended again endless cities,
and nations, and peoples, and places, in this one word “round about.”
For he was far removed from all boasting. And this, he said on their
account, so that they should not be conceited about themselves. And at
the beginning he said, that “I might have some fruit amongst you also,
even as among other Gentiles.” But here he states the compulsion of his
priesthood. For as he had spoken in a sharper tone, he shows also by it
his power more clearly. This is why he there only says, “even as among
other Gentiles.” But here he insists on the topic fully, so that the
conceit may be pruned away on all grounds. And he does not merely say,
preached the Gospel, but “have fully preached the Gospel of
Christ.” <span id="fr_1643"></span>[1644](#fn_1643.md)

<span id="vii.xxxi-p20"></span>[Rom.
15.20](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#020.md)<span
id="vii.xxxi-p20.1"></span>. “Yea, so have I strived to preach the
Gospel, not where Christ was named.”

<span id="vii.xxxi-p21"></span>See here another preeminence; that he had
not only preached the Gospel to so many, and persuaded them, but he did
not even go to those who had become disciples. So far was he from
thrusting himself upon other men’s disciples, and from doing this for
glory’s sake, that he even made it a point to teach those who had not
heard. For neither does he say where they were not persuaded, but “where
Christ was not even named,” which is more. And what was the reason why
he had this ambition? “Lest I should build,” he says, “upon another
man’s foundation.”

<span id="vii.xxxi-p22"></span>This he says to show himself a stranger
to vanity, and to instruct them that it was not from any love of glory,
or of honor from them, that he came to write, but as fulfilling his
ministry, as perfecting his priestly duty, as loving their salvation.
But he calls the foundation of the Apostles “another man’s,” not in
regard to the quality of the person, or the nature of preaching, but in
regard to the question of reward. For it was not that the preaching was
that of another man, <span id="fr_1644"></span>[1645](#fn_1644.md) but so
far as it went to another man’s reward. For the reward of the labors of
others was, to this man, another man’s. Then he shows that a prophecy
was fulfilled also saying,

<span id="vii.xxxi-p24"></span>[Rom.
15.21](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#021.md)<span
id="vii.xxxi-p24.1"></span>. “As it is written, To whom He was not
spoken of, they shall see, and they that have not heard shall
understand.” (<span id="vii.xxxi-p24.2"></span>[Is. iii.
15](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#015.md)<span id="vii.xxxi-p24.3"></span>
\[LXX\].)

<span id="vii.xxxi-p25"></span>You see he runs to where the labor is
more, the toil greater.

<span id="vii.xxxi-p26"></span>[Rom.
15.22](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#022.md)<span
id="vii.xxxi-p26.1"></span>. “For which cause also I have been much
hindered from coming to you.”

<span id="vii.xxxi-p27"></span>Observe again, how he makes the end of
the like texture with the introduction. For while he was quite at the
beginning of the Epistle, he said, “Oftentimes I purpose to come unto
you, but was let hitherto.” ([Rom. i.
13](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#013)<span id="vii.xxxi-p27.1"></span>..md)
But here he gives the cause also by which he was let, and that not once,
but twice even, aye, and many times. For as he says there, “oftentimes I
purposed to come to you,” so here too, “I have been much (or often,
<span class="Greek"><span id="vii.xxxi-p27.2"></span>τὰ πολλὰ</span>)
hindered from coming to you.” Now it is a thing which proves a very
strong desire, that he attempted it so often.

<span id="vii.xxxi-p28"></span>[Rom.
15.23](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#023.md)<span
id="vii.xxxi-p28.1"></span>. “But now having no more place in these
parts.”

<span id="vii.xxxi-p29"></span>See how he shows that it was not from any
coveting of glory from them, that he both wrote and was also coming.
“And having a great desire to come to you these many years,”

<span id="vii.xxxi-p30"></span>[Rom.
15.24](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#024.md)<span
id="vii.xxxi-p30.1"></span>. “Whensoever I take my journey into Spain, I
trust to see you in my journey; and to be brought on my way thitherward
by you, if first I be somewhat filled with your company,”

<span id="vii.xxxi-p31"></span>For that he might not seem to be holding
them very cheap, by saying, Since I have not anything to do, therefore I
am coming to you, he again touches on the point of love by saying, “I
have a great desire, these many years, to come unto you.” For the reason
why I desire to come, is not because I am disengaged, but that I may
give birth to that desire wherewith I am travailing so long. Then that
this again should not puff them up, consider how he lowers them by
saying, “Whensoever I take my journey into Spain, I trust to see you in
my journey.” For this was why he stated this, that they should not be
high-minded. For what he wants is to show his love, and at the same time
to prevent them from being dainty. And so he places this close on the
other, and uses things confirmative of either alternately. For this
reason again that they might not say, Do you make us a by-object of your
journey? he adds, “and to be brought on my way thitherward by you: that
is, that you may be my witnesses that it is not through any slight of
you, but by force of necessity, that I run by you. But as this is still
distressing, he heals it over more carefully, by saying, “If I be first
somewhat filled with your company.” For by his saying, “in my journey,”
he shows that he did not covet their good opinion. But by saying “be
filled,” that he was eager for their love, and not only was eager for
it, but exceedingly so; and this is why he does not say “be filled,” but
be “somewhat” so. That is, no length of time can fill me or create in me
a satiety of your company. See how he shows his love, when even though
in haste he doth not rise up until he be filled. And this is a sign of
his great affectionateness, that he uses his words in so warm a way. For
he does not say even I will see, but “shall be filled,” imitating thus
the language of parents. And at the beginning he said, “that I might
have some fruit.” (<span id="vii.xxxi-p31.1"></span>[Rom. i.
13](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#013)<span id="vii.xxxi-p31.2"></span>..md)
But here that I may be “filled.” And both these are like a person who is
drawing others to him. For the one was a very great commendation of
them, if they were likely to yield him fruit from their obedience; and
the other, a genuine proof of his own friendship. And in writing to the
Corinthians he thus says, “That ye may bring me on my journey
whithersoever I go” ([1 Cor. xvi.
6](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#006)<span id="vii.xxxi-p31.3"></span>.md),
so in all ways exhibiting an unrivalled love to his disciples. And so at
the beginning of all his Epistles it is with this he starts, and at the
end in this he concludes again. For as an indulgent father doth an only
and true born son, so did he love all the faithful. Whence it was that
he said, “Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn
not?” (<span id="vii.xxxi-p31.4"></span>[2 Cor. xi.
29](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#029)<span id="vii.xxxi-p31.5"></span>..md)

<span id="vii.xxxi-p32"></span>For before everything else this is what
the teacher ought to have. Wherefore also to Peter Christ saith, “If
thou lovest Me, feed My sheep.” (<span id="vii.xxxi-p32.1"></span>[John
xxi. 16](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#016.md)<span
id="vii.xxxi-p32.2"></span>.) For he who loveth Christ loveth also His
flock. And Moses too did He then set over the people of the Jews, when
he had shown a kindly feeling towards them. And David in this way came
to be king, having been first seen to be affectionately-minded towards
them; so much indeed, though yet young, did he grieve for the people, as
to risk his life for them, when he killed that barbarian. But if he
said, “What shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine?” ([1
Sam. 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#005.md), [1 Sam.
17:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#026.md)<span
id="vii.xxxi-p32.3"></span>[1 Sam. xix.
5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#005.md)<span id="vii.xxxi-p32.4"></span>;
ib. xvii. 26) he said it not in order to demand a reward, but out of a
wish to have confidence placed in himself, and to have the battle with
him delivered to his charge. And therefore, when he came to the king
after the victory, he said nothing of these things. And Samuel too was
very affectionate; whence it was that he said, “But God forbid that I
should sin in ceasing to pray unto the Lord for you.” (<span
id="vii.xxxi-p32.5"></span>[1 Sam. xii.
23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#023)<span id="vii.xxxi-p32.6"></span>..md)
In like way Paul also, or rather not in like way, but even in a far
greater degree, burned towards all his subjects (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.xxxi-p32.7"></span>τὥν ἀρχομένων</span>).
Wherefore he made his disciples of such affection towards himself, that
he said, “If were possible, ye would have pulled out your eyes and given
them to me.” ([Gal. iv. 15](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#015.md)<span
id="vii.xxxi-p32.8"></span>.) On this ground too it is, that God charges
the teachers of the Jews above all things with this, saying, “Oh
shepherds of Israel, do shepherds feed themselves? do they not feed the
flock?” (<span id="vii.xxxi-p32.9"></span>[Ezek.
34:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#002.md),
[3](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#003)<span id="vii.xxxi-p32.10"></span>..md)
But they did the reverse. For he says, “Ye eat the milk, and clothe you
with the wool, and ye kill them that are fed, but ye feed not the
flock.” And Christ, in bringing out the rule for the fittest Pastor,
said, “The good shepherd layeth down his life for his sheep.” ([John x.
11](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#011)<span id="vii.xxxi-p32.11"></span>..md)
This David did also, both on sundry other occasions, and also when that
fearful wrath from above came down upon the whole people. For while all
were being slain he said, “I the shepherd <span
id="fr_1645"></span>[1646](#fn_1645.md) have sinned, I the shepherd have
done amiss, and these the flock what have they done?” (<span
id="vii.xxxi-p33.1"></span>[2 Sam. xxiv.
17](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#017)<span id="vii.xxxi-p33.2"></span>..md)
And so in the choice of those punishments also, he chose not famine, nor
flight before enemies, but the pestilence sent by God, whereby he hoped
to place all the others in safety, but that he should himself in
preference to all the rest be carried off. But since this was not so, he
bewails, and says, “On me be Thy Hand:” or if this be not enough, “on my
father’s house” also. “For I,” he says, “the shepherd have sinned.” As
though he had said, that if they also sinned, I was the person who
should suffer the vengeance, as I corrected them not. But since the sin
is mine also, it is I who deserve to suffer the vengeance. For wishing
to increase the crime he used the name of “Shepherd.” Thus then he
stayed the wrath, thus he got the sentence revoked! So great is the
power of confession. “For the righteous is his own accuser first.” <span
id="fr_1646"></span>[1647](#fn_1646.md) So great is the concern and
sympathy of a good Pastor. For his bowels were writhed at their falling,
as when one’s own children are killed. And on this ground he begged that
the wrath might come upon himself. And in the beginning of the slaughter
he would have done this, unless he had seen it advancing and expected
that it would come to himself. When therefore he saw that this did not
happen, but that the calamity was raging among them, he no longer
forebore, but was touched more than for Amnon his first-born. For then
he did not ask for death, but now he begs to fall in preference to the
others. Such ought a ruler to be and to grieve rather at the calamities
of others than his own. <span id="fr_1647"></span>[1648](#fn_1647.md) Some
such thing he suffered in his son’s case likewise, that you might see
that he did not love his son more than his subjects, and yet the youth
was unchaste, and an ill-user of his father (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xxxi-p35.1"></span>πατραλοίας</span>), and still he said, “Would
that I might have died for thee!” (<span id="vii.xxxi-p35.2"></span>[2
Sam. xviii. 33](../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#033.md)<span
id="vii.xxxi-p35.3"></span>.) What sayest thou, thou blessed one, thou
meekest of all men? Thy son was set upon killing thee, and compassed
thee about with ills unnumbered. And when he had been removed, and the
trophy was raised, dost thou then pray to be slain? Yea, he says, for it
is not for me that the army has been victorious, but I am warred against
more violently than before, and my bowels are now more torn than before.
These however were all thoughtful for those committed to their charge,
but the blessed Abraham concerned himself much even for those that were
not entrusted to him, and so much so as even to throw himself amongst
alarming dangers. For when he did what he did, not for his nephew only,
but for the people of Sodom also, he did not leave driving those
Persians before him until he had set them all free: and yet he might
have departed after he had taken him, yet he did not choose it. For he
had the like concern for all, and this he showed likewise by his
subsequent conduct. When then it was not a host of barbarians that was
on the point of laying siege to them, but the wrath of God that was
plucking their cities up from the foundations, and it was no longer the
time for arms, and battle, and array, but for supplication; so great was
the zeal he showed for them, as, if he himself had been on the point of
perishing. For this reason he comes once, twice, thrice, aye and many
times to God, and finds a refuge (i.e. an excuse) in his nature by
saying, “I am dust and ashes” (<span id="vii.xxxi-p35.4"></span>[Gen.
xviii. 27](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#027.md)<span
id="vii.xxxi-p35.5"></span>): and since he saw that they were traitors
to themselves, he begs that they may be saved for others. Wherefore also
God said, “I will hide not from Abraham My servant that thing which I am
about to do” ([Gen. 18.17](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#017.md)<span
id="vii.xxxi-p35.6"></span>), that we might learn how loving to man the
righteous is. And he would not have left off beseeching, unless God had
left off first (so he takes [Gen.
18.33](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#033.md)<span
id="vii.xxxi-p35.7"></span>). And he seems indeed to be praying for the
just, but is doing the whole for them. For the souls of the Saints are
very gentle and, loving unto man, both in regard to their own, and to
strangers. And even to the unreasoning creatures they extend their
gentleness. Wherefore also a certain wise man said, “The righteous
pitieth the souls of his cattle.” <span
id="fr_1648"></span>[1649](#fn_1648.md) But if he doth those of cattle, how
much more those of men. But since I have mentioned cattle, let us just
consider the shepherds of the sheep who are in the Cappadocian land, and
what they suffer in kind and degree in their guardianship of unreasoning
creatures. They often stay for three days together buried down under the
snows. And those in Libya are said to undergo no less hardships than
these, ranging about for whole months through that wilderness, dreary as
it is, and filled with the direst wild beasts (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xxxi-p36.3"></span>θηρία</span> may include serpents). Now if
for unreasonable things there be so much zeal, what defense are we to
set up, who are entrusted with reasonable souls, and yet slumber on in
this deep sleep? For is it right to be at rest, and in quiet, and not to
be running about everywhere, and giving one’s self up to endless deaths
in behalf of these sheep? Or know ye not the dignity of this flock? Was
it not for this that thy Master took endless pains, and afterwards
poured forth His blood? And dost thou seek for rest? Now what can be
worse than these Shepherds? Dost thou not perceive, that there stand
round about these sheep wolves much more fierce and savage than those of
this world? Dost thou not think with thyself, what a soul he ought to
have who is to take in hand this office? Now men that lead the populace,
if they have but common matters to deliberate on, add days to nights in
watching. And we that are struggling in heaven’s behalf sleep even in
the daytime. And who is now to deliver us from the punishment for these
things? For if the body were to be cut in pieces, if to undergo ten
thousand deaths, ought one not to run to it as to a feast? And let not
the shepherds only, but the sheep also hear this; that they may make the
shepherds the more active minded, that they may the more encourage their
good-will: I do not mean by anything else but by yielding all compliance
and obedience. Thus Paul also bade them, saying, “Obey them which have
the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls
as they that must give account.” ([Heb. xiii.
17](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#017)<span id="vii.xxxi-p36.4"></span>..md)
And when he says, “watch,” he means thousands of labors, cares and
dangers. For the good Shepherd, who is such as Christ wisheth for, is
contending, before countless witnesses. For He died once for him; but
this man ten thousand times for the flock, if, that is, he be such a
shepherd as he ought to be; for such an one can die every day. (See on
[Rom. viii. 36](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#036.md)<span
id="vii.xxxi-p36.5"></span>. p. 456.) And therefore do ye, as being
acquainted with what the labor is, coöperate with them, with prayers,
with zeal, with readiness, with affection, that both we may have to
boast of you, and you of us. For on this ground He entrusted this to the
chief <span id="fr_1649"></span>[1650](#fn_1649.md) of the Apostles, who
also loved Him more than the rest; after first asking him if He was
loved by him, that thou mayest learn that this before other things, is
held as a proof of love to Him. For this requireth a vigorous soul. This
I have said of the best shepherds; not of myself and those of our days,
but of any one that may be such as Paul was, such as Peter, such as
Moses. These then let us imitate, both the rulers of us and the ruled.
For the ruled may be in the place of a shepherd to his family, to his
friends, to his servants, to his wife, to his children: and if we so
order our affairs we shall attain to all manner of good things. Which
God grant that we may all attain unto, by the grace and love toward man,
etc.

understands it to mean, *in a sort—gently,* two other views deserve
notice (1) that which joins it to <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xxxi-p7.5"></span>τολμηρότερον</span>—*in part,* or *somewhat
more boldly* (Hodge) and (2) that which joins it to <span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.xxxi-p7.6"></span>ἔ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.xxxi-p7.7"></span>γραψα</span>—I have
written more boldly in parts of the epistle (De Wette, Meyer, Alford).
Both our Eng. vss. seem to understand it as Chrys. viz.: as a
conciliatory modification of “more boldly,” and connecting with it the
explanatory statement that the reason of his more bold writing was the
kindly one of putting them in remembrance.—G.B.S.

may yield three different meanings according to the word which receives
the main emphasis. If it is placed on *through me* the meaning is: I
shall not mention or lay claim to results wrought by others, but only to
those secured by *my own* labors. The desire of the apostle ([Rom.
15.20](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#020.md)<span
id="vii.xxxi-p16.2"></span>) not to build upon another man’s foundation
favors this view. (So Alford, Hodge). If the stress is placed on the
word *wrought* the sense is: I shall not dare to mention any of those
things which Christ did not *actually work,* i.e., I shall make no claim
to success not actually achieved (Meyer). The emphasis may be placed on
*Christ.* If so, it means: I will mention only what Christ (he and he
alone) wrought through me for the extension of his kingdom. Chrys.
understands the passage thus and, we think, rightly. (So Tholuck,
Olshausen, Boise).—G.B.S.
