<span id="vii.xxi-p2"></span>[Rom. XI.

<span id="vii.xxi-p3"></span>*“What then?* <span
id="fr_1505"></span>[1506](#fn_1505.md) *Israel hath not obtained that,
which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained it and the rest
were blinded.”*

<span id="vii.xxi-p5"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="vii.xxi-p5.1"></span>He</span> had said that God did not cast off
His people; and to show in what sense He had not cast them off, he takes
refuge in the Prophets again. <span id="fr_1506"></span>[1507](#fn_1506.md)
And having shown by them that the more part of the Jews were lost, that
he might not seem to be again bringing forward an accusation of his own,
and to make his discourse offensive, and to be attacking them as
enemies, he takes refuge in David and Isaiah, and says,

<span id="vii.xxi-p7"></span>[Rom.
11.8](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#008.md)<span id="vii.xxi-p7.1"></span>.
“According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of slumber.”
(<span id="vii.xxi-p7.2"></span>[Is. xxix.
10](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#010)<span id="vii.xxi-p7.3"></span>..md)

<span id="vii.xxi-p8"></span>Or rather we should go back to the
beginning of his argument. Having then mentioned the state of things in
Elijah’s time, and shown what grace is, he proceeds, “What then? Israel
hath not obtained that which he seeketh for.” Now this is as much what
an accuser would say, as what one who was putting a question. For the
Jew, he means, is inconsistent with himself when he seeketh for
righteousness, which he will not accept. Then to leave them with no
excuse, he shows, from those who have accepted it, their unfeeling
spirit, as he says, “But the election hath obtained it,” and they are
the condemnation of the others. And this is what Christ says, “But if I
by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your children cast them out?
Wherefore they shall be your judges.” ([Luke xi.
19](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#019)<span id="vii.xxi-p8.1"></span>..md)
For to prevent any one from accusing the nature of the thing, and not
their own temper, he points out those who had obtained it. Hence he uses
the word <span id="fr_1507"></span>[1508](#fn_1507.md) with great
propriety, to show at once the grace from above and the zeal of these.
For it is not to deny free-will that he speaks of their having
“obtained” (as by chance, Gr. <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xxi-p9.1"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xxi-p9.2"></span>πέτυχε</span>) it, but to show the greatness of
the good things, and that the greater part was of grace, though not the
whole. <span id="fr_1508"></span>[1509](#fn_1508.md) For we too are in the
habit of saying, “so and so chanced to get” (same word), “so and so met
with,” when the gain has been a great one. Because it is not by man’s
labors, but by God’s gift, that the greater part was brought about.

<span id="vii.xxi-p11"></span>“And the rest was blinded.”

<span id="vii.xxi-p12"></span>See how he has been bold enough to tell
with his own voice the casting off of the rest. For he had indeed spoken
of it already, but it was by bringing the prophets in as accusers. But
from this point he declares it in his own person. Still even here he is
not content with his own declaration, but brings Isaiah the prophet in
again. For after saying, “were blinded,” he proceeds; “according as it
is written, God hath given them the spirit of slumber.” Now whence came
this blinding? He had indeed mentioned the causes of it before, and
turned it all upon their own heads, to show that it was from their
unseasonable obstinacy that they had to bear this. And now he speaks of
it too. For when he says, “Eyes that they should not see, and ears that
they should not hear,” he is but finding fault with their contentious
spirit. For when they had “eyes to see” the miracles, and were possessed
of “ears to hear” that marvellous Teaching, they never used these as
were fitting. And the “He gave,” do not imagine to mean here an agency,
but a permission only. But “slumber” (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xxi-p12.1"></span>καταάνυξις</span> lit. piercing) is a name he
here gives to the habit of soul inclinable to the worse, when incurably
and unchangeably so. For in another passage David says, “that my glory
may sing unto Thee, and I may not be put to slumber” ([Ps. xxx.
12](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#012.md)<span id="vii.xxi-p12.2"></span>,
LXX.): that is, I may not alter, may not be changed. For as a man who is
hushed to slumber in a state of pious fear would not easily be made to
change his side; so too he that is slumbering in wickedness would not
change with facility. For to be hushed <span
id="fr_1509"></span>[1510](#fn_1509.md) to slumber here is nothing else but
to be fixed and riveted to a thing. In pointing then to the incurable
and unchangeable character of their spirit, he calls it “a spirit of
slumber.” Then to show that for this unbelief they will be most severely
punished, he brings the Prophet forward again, threatening the very
things which in the event came to pass.

<span id="vii.xxi-p14"></span>[Rom.
11.9](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#009.md)<span id="vii.xxi-p14.1"></span>.
“Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumbling-block.”
(<span id="vii.xxi-p14.2"></span>[Ps.
69:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#022.md),
[23](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#023)<span id="vii.xxi-p14.3"></span>..md)

<span id="vii.xxi-p15"></span>That is, let their comforts and all their
good things change and perish, and let them be open to attack from any
one. And to show that this is in punishment for sins that they suffer
this, he adds, “and a recompense unto them.”

<span id="vii.xxi-p16"></span>[Rom.
11.10](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#010.md)<span id="vii.xxi-p16.1"></span>.
“Let their eyes be darkened that they may not see, and bow Thou down
their back alway.”

<span id="vii.xxi-p17"></span>Do these things then still require any
interpreting? Are they not plain even to those ever so senseless? And
before our words, the very issue of facts has anticipated us in bearing
witness to what was said. For at what time have they ever been so open
to attacks? at what time such an easy prey? at what time hath He so
“bowed down their backs?” At what time have they been set under such
bondage? And what is more, there is not to be any unloosing from these
terrors. And this the prophet hath also hinted. For he does not say
only, “bow Thou down their back,” but, “forever bow Thou down.” But if
thou art disposed to dispute, O Jew, about the issue, from what hath
gone before learn also the present case. Thou didst go down to Egypt;
and two hundred years passed, and God freed thee speedily from that
bondage, and that though thou wert irreligious, and wentest a whoring
with the most baneful whoredom. Thou wast freed from Egypt, and thou
didst worship the calf, thou didst sacrifice thy sons to Baalpeor, thou
didst defile the temple, thou didst go after every sort of vice, thou
didst grow not to know nature itself. The mountains, the groves, the
hills, the springs, the rivers, the gardens didst thou fill with
accursed sacrifices, thou didst slay the prophets, didst overthrow the
altars, didst exhibit every excess of wickedness and irreligion. Still,
after giving thee up for seventy years to the Babylonians, He brought
thee back again to thy former freedom, and gave thee back the temple,
and thy country, and thy old form of polity <span
id="fr_1510"></span>[1511](#fn_1510.md) and there were prophets again, and
the gift of the Spirit. Or rather, even in the season of thy captivity
thou wast not deserted, but even there were Daniel, and Ezekiel, and in
Egypt Jeremiah, and in the desert Moses. After this thou didst revert to
thy former vice again, and wast a reveller (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xxi-p18.2"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xxi-p18.3"></span>ξεβακχεύθης</span> <span
id="vii.xxi-p18.4"></span>[2 Macc. xiv.
33](../../../bib/apo/ma2014.htm#033)<span id="vii.xxi-p18.5"></span>.md),
therein, and didst change thy manner of life (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xxi-p18.6"></span>πολιτείαν</span> to the Grecian in the time of
Antiochus the impious [Dan. viii.
14](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#014.md)<span id="vii.xxi-p18.7"></span>;
<span id="vii.xxi-p18.8"></span>[1 Macc. iv.
54](../../../bib/apo/ma1004.htm#054)<span id="vii.xxi-p18.9"></span>.md).
But even then for a three years and a little over only were ye given up
to Antiochus, and then by the Maccabees ye raised those bright trophies
again. But now there is nothing of the sort, for the reverse hath
happened throughout. And this is ground for the greatest surprise, as
the vices have ceased, and the punishment hath been increased, and is
without any hope of a change. For it is not seventy years only that have
passed away, nor a hundred, nor yet twice as many but three hundred, and
a good deal over, and there is no finding even a shadow of a hope of the
kind. And this though ye neither are idolaters, nor do the other
audacious acts ye did before. What then is the cause? The reality hath
succeeded to the type, and grace hath shut out the Law. And this the
prophet foretelling from of old said, “And ever bow Thou down their
back.” See the minuteness of prophecy, how it foretells their unbelief,
and also points out their disputatiousness, and shows the judgment which
should follow, and sets forth the endlessness of the punishment. For as
many of the duller sort, through unbelief in what was to come to pass,
wished to see things to come by the light of things present, from this
point of time God gave proof of His power on either part, by lifting
those of the Gentiles who believed, above the heaven, but bringing down
such of the Jews as believed not to the lowest estate of desolation, and
giving them up to evils not to be ended. Having then urged them severely
both about their not believing, and about what they had suffered and
were yet to suffer, he again allays what he had said by writing as
follows:

<span id="vii.xxi-p19"></span>[Rom.
11.11](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#011.md)<span id="vii.xxi-p19.1"></span>.
“I say then, Have they stumbled, that they should fall? God forbid.”

<span id="vii.xxi-p20"></span>When he has shown that they were liable to
evils without number, then he devises an allayment. And consider the
judgment of Paul. The accusation he had introduced from the prophets,
but the allayment he makes come from himself. For that they had sinned
greatly, he would say, none will gainsay. But let us see if the fall is
of such kind as to be incurable, and quite preclude their being set up
again. But of such kind it is not. <span
id="fr_1511"></span>[1512](#fn_1511.md) You see how he is attacking them
again, and under the expectation of some allayment he proves them guilty
of confessed sins. But let us see what even by way of allayment he does
devise for them. Now what is the allayment? “When the fulness of the
Gentiles,” he says, “shall have come in, then shall all Israel be
saved,” at the time of his second coming, and the end of the world. Yet
this he does not say at once. But since he had made a hard onset upon
them, and linked accusations to accusations, bringing prophets in after
prophets crying aloud against them, Isaiah, Elijah, David, Moses, Hosea,
not once or twice, but several times; lest in this way he should both by
driving these into despair, make a wall to bar their access to the
faith, and should further make such of the Gentiles as believed
unreasonably elated, and they also by being puffed up should take harm
in matter of their faith, he further solaces them by saying, “But rather
through their fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles.” But we must not
take what is here said literally, but get acquainted with the spirit and
object of the speaker, and what he aimed to compass. Which thing I ever
entreat of your love. For if with this in our minds we take up what is
here said, we shall not find a difficulty in any part of it. For his
present anxiety is to remove from those of the Gentiles the haughtiness
which might spring in them from what he had said. For in this way they
too were more likely to continue unshaken in the faith, when they had
learnt to be reasonable, as also those of the Jews were, when quit of
despair, more likely to come with readiness to grace. Having regard then
to this object of his, let us so listen to all that is said on this
passage. What does he say then? And whence does he show that their fall
was not irremediable, nor their rejection final? He argues from the
Gentiles, saying as follows:

<span id="vii.xxi-p22"></span>“Through their fall salvation is come unto
the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy.”

<span id="vii.xxi-p23"></span>This language is not his own only, but in
the Gospels too the parables mean this. For He who made a marriage feast
for His Son, when the guests would not come, called those in the
highways. ([Matt. xxii. 9](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#009.md)<span
id="vii.xxi-p23.1"></span>). And He who planted the Vineyard, when the
husbandmen slew the Heir, let out His Vineyard to others. ([Matt.
21.38](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#038.md)<span id="vii.xxi-p23.2"></span>,
etc.) And without any parable, He Himself said, “I am not sent but unto
the lost sheep of the House of Israel.” ([Matt.
15.24](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#024.md)<span
id="vii.xxi-p23.3"></span>.) And to the Syrophœnician woman, when she
persevered, He said somewhat further besides. “It is not meet,” He says,
“to take the children’s bread, and cast it to the dogs.” ([Matt.
15.26](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#026.md)<span
id="vii.xxi-p23.4"></span>.) And Paul to those of the Jews that raised a
sedition, “It was necessary that the word of God should first have been
spoken unto you: but seeing ye judge yourselves unworthy, lo, we turn
unto the Gentiles.” (<span id="vii.xxi-p23.5"></span>[Acts xiii.
46](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#046)<span id="vii.xxi-p23.6"></span>..md)
And throughout it is clear that the natural course of things was this,
that they should be the first to come in, and then those of the
Gentiles; but since they disbelieved, the order was reversed; and their
unbelief and fall caused these to be brought in first. Hence it is that
he says, “through their fall salvation is come to the Gentiles, for to
provoke them to jealousy.” But if he mentions what the course of things
issued in, as if the chief design of Providence, do not feel surprised.
For he wishes to solace their down-stricken souls, and his meaning is
about this. Jesus came to them; they did not receive Him, though He did
countless miracles, but crucified Him. Hence He drew the Gentiles to
Him, that the honor they had, by cutting them to the heart for their
insensibility might at least out of a moroseness against others persuade
them to come over. For they ought to have been first admitted, and then
we. And this was why he said, “For it is the power of God unto salvation
unto every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the
Gentile.” (<span id="vii.xxi-p23.7"></span>[Rom. i.
16](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#016)<span id="vii.xxi-p23.8"></span>..md)
But as they had started off, we the last became first. See then how
great honors he gathers for them even from this. One that he says, we
were then called, when they were not willing; a second that he says, the
reason of our being called was not that we only might be saved, but that
they also, growing jealous at our salvation, might become better. What
does he say then? that if it were not for the Jews’ sake, we should not
have been called and saved at all? We should not before them, but in the
regular order. Wherefore also when He was speaking to the disciples, He
did not say barely, “Go to the lost sheep of the House of Israel”
([Matt. x. 6](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#006.md)<span
id="vii.xxi-p23.9"></span>), but, “Go rather to the sheep,” to show that
to those parts also they must come after these. And Paul again saith
not, “It was necessary that the word of God should have been spoken unto
you,” but “should first have been spoken unto you” ([Acts xiii.
46](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#046)<span id="vii.xxi-p23.10"></span>.md),
to show that in the second place it must be to us also. And this was
both done and said, that they might not be able, shameless though they
were, to pretend that they were overlooked, and that was why they did
not believe. This then was why Christ, though he knew all things before,
yet came to them first.

<span id="vii.xxi-p24"></span>[Rom.
11.12](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#012.md)<span id="vii.xxi-p24.1"></span>.
“Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing
of them the riches of the Gentiles, how much more their fulness?”

<span id="vii.xxi-p25"></span>Here he is speaking to gratify them. For
even if these had fallen a thousand times, the Gentiles would not have
been saved unless they had shown faith. As the Jews likewise would not
have perished unless they had been unbelieving and disputatious. But as
I said, he is solacing them now they are laid low, giving them so much
the more ground to be confident of their salvation if they altered. For
if when they stumbled, he says, so many enjoyed salvation, and when they
were cast out so many were called, just consider what will be the case
when they return. But he does not put it thus, When they return. Now he
does not say “how much more their” return, or their altering, or their
well-doing, but “how much more their fulness,” that is, when they are
all about coming in. And this he said to show that then also grace and
God’s gift will do the larger part, or almost the whole.

<span id="vii.xxi-p26"></span>[Rom.
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#013.md),
[14](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#014.md)<span id="vii.xxi-p26.1"></span>.
“For I speak to you Gentiles; inasmuch as I am the Apostle of the
Gentiles, I magnify mine office; if by any means I may provoke to
emulation them which are my flesh, and might save some of them.”

<span id="vii.xxi-p27"></span>Again he endeavors much to get himself
clear of untoward suspicion. And he seems to be blaming the Gentiles,
and to be humbling their conceits, yet he gives a gentle provocation to
the Jew also. And indeed he goes round about seeking to veil and allay
this great ruin of theirs. But he finds no means of doing it, owing to
the nature of the facts. For from what he had said, they deserved but
the greater condemnation, when those who were far short of them had
taken the good things prepared for them. This is why then he passes from
the Jews to those of the Gentiles, and puts in between his discourse the
part about them, as wishing to show that he is saying all these things
in order to instruct them to be reasonable. For I praise you, he means,
for these two reasons; one, because I am necessitated to do so as being
your commissioned minister; the other, that through you I may save
others. And he does not say, my brethren, my kinsmen; but, “my flesh.”
And next, when pointing out their disputatious spirit, he does not say,
“if by any means I may” persuade, but, “provoke to jealousy and save;”
and here again not all, but, “some of them.” So hard were they! And even
amid his rebuke he shows again the Gentiles honored, for they are causes
of their salvation, and not in the same way. For they became purveyors
of blessings to them through unbelief, but these to the Jews by faith.
Hence the estate of the Gentiles seems to be at once equal and superior.
For what wilt thou say, O Jew? that if we had not been cast out, he
would not have been called so soon? This the man of the Gentiles may say
too, If I had not been saved, thou wouldest not have been moved to
jealousy. But if thou wouldest know wherein we have the advantage, I
save thee by believing, but it is by stumbling that thou hast afforded
us an access before thyself. Then perceiving again that he had touched
them to the quick, resuming his former argument, he says,

<span id="vii.xxi-p28"></span>[Rom.
11.15](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#015.md)<span id="vii.xxi-p28.1"></span>.
“For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what
shall the receiving of them be but life from the dead?”

<span id="vii.xxi-p29"></span>Yet this again condemns them, since, while
others gained by their sins, they did not profit by other men’s well
doings. But if he asserts that to be their doing which necessarily
happened, be not surprised: since (as I have said several times) it is
to humble these, and to exhort the other, that he throws his address
into this form. For as I said before, if the Jews had been cast away a
thousand times over, and the Gentiles had not shown faith, they would
never have been saved. But he stands by the feeble party, and gives
assistance to the distressed one. But see also even in his favors to
them, how he solaces them in words only. “For if the casting away of
them be the reconciling of the world,” (and what is this to the Jews?)
“what shall the receiving of them be but life from the dead?” Yet even
this was no boon to them, unless they had been received. But what he
means is to this effect. If in anger with them He gave other men so
great gifts, when He is reconciled to them what will He not give? But as
the resurrection of the dead was not by the receiving of them, so
neither now is our salvation through them. But they were cast out owing
to their own folly, but it is by faith that we are saved, and by grace
from above. But of all this nothing can be of service to them, unless
they show the requisite faith. Yet doing as he is wont, he goes on to
another encomium, which is not really one, but which only seems to be,
so imitating the wisest physicians, who give their patients as much
consolation as the nature of the sickness allows them. And what is it
that he says?

<span id="vii.xxi-p30"></span>[Rom.
11.16](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#016.md)<span id="vii.xxi-p30.1"></span>.
“For if the first-fruits be holy, the lump also is holy; and if the root
be holy, so are the branches;”

<span id="vii.xxi-p31"></span>So calling in this passage by the names of
the first-fruit and root Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, the prophets,
the patriarchs, all who were of note in the Old Testament; and the
branches, those from them who believed. Then since the fact met him that
many had disbelieved, observe how he undermines (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.xxi-p31.1"></span>ὑ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.xxi-p31.2"></span>ποτέμνεται</span>, see p.
345) it again, and says,

<span id="vii.xxi-p32"></span>[Rom.
11.17](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#017.md)<span id="vii.xxi-p32.1"></span>.
“And if some of the branches be broken off.”

<span id="vii.xxi-p33"></span>And yet above thou didst say that the more
part perished, and a few were saved only. How came it then that speaking
of those that perished, thou hast used a “some,” which is indicative of
fewness? It is not, he replies, in opposition to myself, but out of a
desire to court and recover those that are distressed. Observe how in
the whole of the passage one finds him working at this object, the wish
to solace them. And if you deny it, many contradictions will follow. But
let me beg you to notice his wisdom, how while he seems to be speaking
for them, and devising a solace for them, he aims a secret blow at them,
and shows that they are devoid of all excuse, even from the “root,” from
the “first-fruit.” For consider the badness of the branches, which, when
they have a sweet root, still do not imitate it; and the faultiness of
the lump, when it is not altered even by the first-fruit. “And if some
of the branches were broken off.” However, the greater part were broken
off. Yet, as I said, he wishes to comfort them. And this is why it is
not in his own person, but in theirs, that he brings in the words used,
and even in this gives a secret stroke at them, and shows them to have
fallen from being Abraham’s kinsmen. ([Matt. iii.
9](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#009)<span id="vii.xxi-p33.1"></span>..md)
For what he was desirous of saying was, that they had nothing in common
with them. (<span id="vii.xxi-p33.2"></span>[John viii.
39](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#039)<span id="vii.xxi-p33.3"></span>..md)
For if the root be holy, and these be not holy, then these are far away
from the root. Then under the appearance of solacing the Jews, he again
by his accusation smiteth them of the Gentiles. For after saying, “And
if some of the branches were broken off,” he proceeds.

<span id="vii.xxi-p34"></span>“And thou being a wild olive wert grafted
in.”

<span id="vii.xxi-p35"></span>For the less esteem the man of the
Gentiles is of, the more the Jew is vexed at seeing him enjoy his goods.
And to the other, the disgrace of the little esteem he was of, is
nothing to the honor of the change. And consider his skilfulness. He
does not say, “thou wert” planted “in,” but “thou wert grafted in,” by
this again cutting the Jew to the heart, as showing that the Gentile man
was standing in his own tree, and himself lying on the ground. Wherefore
he does not stop even here, nor after he had spoken of grafting in does
he leave off (and yet in this he declared the whole matter), but still
he dwells over the prosperous state of the Gentile, and enlarges upon
his fair fame in the words, “And with them partakest of the root and
fatness of the olive tree.” And he seems indeed to have viewed him in
the light of an addition. But he shows that he was no whit the worse on
that account, but in possession of everything, that the branch which had
come up out of the root had. Lest then on hearing the words, “and thou
wert grafted in,” thou shouldest suppose him to be lacking when compared
with the natural branch, see how he makes him equal to it by saying,
that “with them thou partakest of the root and fatness of the olive:”
that is, hast been put into the same noble rank, the same nature. Then
in rebuking him, and saying,

<span id="vii.xxi-p36"></span>[Rom.
11.18](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#018.md)<span id="vii.xxi-p36.1"></span>.
“Boast not against the branches.” He seems indeed to be comforting the
Jew, but points out his vileness and extreme dishonor. And this is why
he says not, “boast not,” but, “boast not against” do not boast against
them so as to sunder them. For it is into their place that ye have been
set, and their goods that ye enjoy. Do you observe how he seems to be
rebuking the one, while he is sharp upon the other?

<span id="vii.xxi-p37"></span>“But if thou boast,” he says, “thou
bearest not the root, but the root thee.”

<span id="vii.xxi-p38"></span>Now what is this to the branches that are
cut off? Nothing. For, as I said before, while seeming to devise a sort
of weak shadow of consolation, and in the very midst of his aiming at
the Gentile, he gives them a mortal blow; for by saying, “boast not
against them,” and, “if thou boast, thou bearest not the root,” he has
shown the Jew that the things done deserved boasting of, even if it was
not right to boast, thus at once rousing him and provoking him to faith,
and smiting at him, in the attitude of an advocate, and pointing out to
him the punishment he was undergoing, and that other men had possession
of what were their goods.

<span id="vii.xxi-p39"></span>[Rom.
11.19](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#019.md)<span id="vii.xxi-p39.1"></span>.
“Thou wilt say then,” he goes on, “The branches were broken off that I
might be grafted in.”

<span id="vii.xxi-p40"></span>Again he establishes, by way of objection,
the opposite to the former position, to show that what he said before,
he had not said as directly belonging to the subject, but to draw them
to him. For it was no longer by their fall that salvation came to the
Gentiles, nor was it their fall that was the riches of the world. Nor
was it by this that we were saved, because they had fallen, but the
reverse. And he shows that the providence in regard to the Gentiles was
a main object, even though he seems to put what he says into another
form. And the whole passage is a tissue of objections, in which he
clears himself of the suspicion of hatred, and makes his language such
as will be acceptable.

<span id="vii.xxi-p41"></span>[Rom.
11.20](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#020.md)<span id="vii.xxi-p41.1"></span>.
“Well,” he praises what they said, then he alarms them again by saying,
“Because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou art grafted in <span
id="fr_1512"></span>[1513](#fn_1512.md) by faith.”

<span id="vii.xxi-p43"></span>So here another encomium, and for the
other party an accusation. But he again lays their pride low by
proceeding to say, “be not high-minded, but fear.” For the thing is not
matter of nature, but of belief and unbelief. And he seems to be again
bridling the Gentile, but he is teaching the Jew that it is not right to
cling to a natural kinsmanship. Hence he goes on with, “Be not
high-minded,” and he does not say, but be humble, but, fear. For
haughtiness genders a contempt and listlessness. Then as he is going
into all the sorrows of their calamity, in order to make the statement
less offensive, he states it in the way of a rebuke given to the other
as follows:

<span id="vii.xxi-p44"></span>[Rom.
11.21](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#021.md)<span id="vii.xxi-p44.1"></span>.
“For if God spared not the natural branches,” and then he does not say,
neither will He spare thee, but “take heed, lest He also spare not
thee.” So paring (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xxi-p44.2"></span>ὑ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xxi-p44.3"></span>ποτεμνόμενος</span>) away the distasteful from
his statement, representing the believer as in the struggle, he at once
draws the others to him, and humbles these also.

<span id="vii.xxi-p45"></span>[Rom.
11.22](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#022.md)<span id="vii.xxi-p45.1"></span>.
“Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell,
severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in His goodness:
otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.”

<span id="vii.xxi-p46"></span>And he does not say, Behold thy well
doing, behold thy labors, but, “Behold the goodness of God” toward man,
to show that the whole comes of grace from above, and to make us
tremble. For this reason for boasting should make thee to fear: since
the Lord (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xxi-p46.1"></span>δεσπότης</span>) hath been good unto thee, do
thou therefore fear. For the blessings do not abide by thee unmovable if
thou turnest listless, as neither do the evils with them, if they alter;
“For thou also,” he says, “unless thou continue in the faith, wilt be
cut off.”

<span id="vii.xxi-p47"></span>[Rom.
11.23](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#023.md)<span id="vii.xxi-p47.1"></span>.
“And they also, if they abide not in unbelief, shall be grafted in.”

<span id="vii.xxi-p48"></span>For it was not God that cut them off, but
they have broken themselves off and fallen, and he did well to say
have <span id="fr_1513"></span>[1514](#fn_1513.md) broken themselves off.
For He hath never yet so (Sav. conj. <span class="c14"><span
id="vii.xxi-p49.3"></span>ms.</span> corr. <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xxi-p49.4"></span>οὗτος</span>) cast them off, though they have
sinned so much and so often. You see what a great thing a man’s free
choice is, how great the efficacy of the mind is. For none of these
things is immutable, neither thy good nor his evil. You see too how he
raises up even him in his despondency, and humbles the other in his
confidence; and do not thou be faint at hearing of severity, nor thou be
confident at hearing of goodness. The reason why He cut thee <span
id="fr_1514"></span>[1515](#fn_1514.md) off in severity was, that thou
mightest long to come back. The reason why He showed goodness to thee
was, that thou mightest continue in (he does not say the faith, but) His
goodness, that is, if thou do things worthy of God’s love toward man.
For there is need of something more than faith. You see how he suffers
neither these to lie low, nor those to be elated, but he also provokes
them to jealousy, by giving through them a power to the Jew to be set
again in this one’s place, as he also had first taken the other’s
ground. And the Gentile he put in fear by the Jews, and what had
happened to them, lest they should feel elated over it. But the Jew he
tries to encourage by what had been afforded to the Greek. For thou
also, he says, wilt be cut off if thou growest listless, (for the Jew
was cut off), and he will be grafted in if he be earnest, for thou also
wast grafted in. But it is very judicious in him to direct all he says
to the Gentile, as he is always in the habit of doing, correcting the
feeble by rebuking the stronger. This he does in the end of this Epistle
too, when he is speaking of the observance of meats. Then, he grounds
this on what had already happened, not upon what was to come only. And
this was more likely to persuade his hearer. And as he means to enter on
consecutiveness of reasonings, such as could not be spoken against, he
first uses a demonstration drawn from the power of God. For if they were
cut off, and cast aside, and others took precedence of them in what was
theirs, still even now despair not.

<span id="vii.xxi-p51"></span>“For God is able,” he says, “to graft them
in again,” since He doeth things beyond expectation. But if thou wishest
for things to be in order, and reasons to be consecutive, you have from
yourselves a demonstration which more than meets your wants.

<span id="vii.xxi-p52"></span>[Rom.
11.24](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#024.md)<span id="vii.xxi-p52.1"></span>.
“For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree, which is wild by nature,
and were grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree, how much
more shall these, which be the natural branches, be grafted <span
id="fr_1515"></span>[1516](#fn_1515.md) into their own olive tree.”

<span id="vii.xxi-p54"></span>If then faith was able to do what was
contrary to nature, much more will it that which is according to nature.
For if this person, who was cut off from those by nature his
fathers, <span id="fr_1516"></span>[1517](#fn_1516.md) came contrary to
nature unto Abraham, much more wilt thou be able to recover thine own.
For the Gentile’s evil lot is according to nature (he being by nature a
wild olive), and the good contrary to nature (it being contrary to
nature for him to be grafted into Abraham), but thy lot on the contrary
is the good by nature. For it is not upon another root, as the Gentile,
but on thine own that thou art to be fixed if thou art minded to come
back. What then dost thou deserve, when after the Gentile had been able
to do what was contrary to nature, thou art not able to do that which is
according to nature, but hast given up even this? Then as he had said
“contrary to nature,” and, “wert grafted in,” that you may not suppose
the Jew to have the advantage, he again corrects this by saying that he
also is grafted in. “How much more shall these,” says he, “which be the
natural branches be grafted into their own olive-tree?” And again, “God
is able to graft them in.” And before this he says, that if they “abide
not still in unbelief, they shall be also grafted in.” And when you hear
that he keeps speaking of “according to nature,” and “contrary to
nature,” do not suppose that he means the nature that is unchangeable,
but he tells us in these words of the probable and the consecutive, and
on the other hand of the improbable. For the good things and the bad are
not such as <span id="fr_1517"></span>[1518](#fn_1517.md) are by nature,
but by temper and determination alone. And consider also how inoffensive
he is. For after saying that thou also wilt be cut off, if thou dost not
abide in the faith, and these will be grafted in, if they “abide not
still in unbelief,” he leaves that of harsh aspect, and insists on that
of kindlier sound, and in it he ends, putting great hopes before the
Jews if they were minded not to abide so. Wherefore he goes on to say,

<span id="vii.xxi-p57"></span>[Rom.
11.25](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#025.md)<span id="vii.xxi-p57.1"></span>.
“For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery,
lest ye should be wise your own conceits.”

<span id="vii.xxi-p58"></span>Meaning by mystery here, that which is
unknown and unutterable, and hath much of wonder and much of what one
should not expect about it. As in another passage too he says, “Behold,
I tell you a mystery. We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be
changed.” ([1 Cor. xv. 51](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#051.md)<span
id="vii.xxi-p58.1"></span>.) What then is the mystery?

<span id="vii.xxi-p59"></span>“That blindness in part hath happened unto
Israel.” Here again he levels a blow at the Jew, while seeming to take
down the Gentile. But his meaning is nearly this, and he had said it
before, that the unbelief is not universal, but only “in part.” As when
he says, “But if any hath caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in
part” (<span id="vii.xxi-p59.1"></span>[2 Cor. ii.
5](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#005)<span id="vii.xxi-p59.2"></span>.md):
And, so here too he says what he had said above, “God hath not cast off
His people whom He foreknew” ([Rom. xi.
2](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#002)<span id="vii.xxi-p59.3"></span>.md):
and again, “What then? Have they stumbled that they should fall? God
forbid” ([Rom. 11.11](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#011.md)<span
id="vii.xxi-p59.4"></span>): This then he says here also; that it is not
the whole people that is pulled up, but many have already believed, and
more are likely to believe. Then as he had promised a great thing, he
adduces the prophet in evidence, speaking as follows. Now it is not for
the fact of a blindness having happened that he quotes the passage (for
every one could see that), but that they shall believe and be saved, he
brings Isaiah to witness, who crieth aloud and saith,

<span id="vii.xxi-p60"></span>[Rom.
11.26](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#026.md)<span id="vii.xxi-p60.1"></span>.
“There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away
ungodliness from Jacob.” ([Is. lix.
20](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#020)<span id="vii.xxi-p60.2"></span>..md)

<span id="vii.xxi-p61"></span>Then to give the mark that fixes its sense
to salvation, to prevent any one from drawing it aside and attaching it
to times gone by, he says,

<span id="vii.xxi-p62"></span>[Rom.
11.27](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#027.md)<span id="vii.xxi-p62.1"></span>.
“For this is my covenant unto them, <span
id="fr_1518"></span>[1519](#fn_1518.md) when I shall take away their sins.”

<span id="vii.xxi-p64"></span>Not when they are circumcised, not when
they sacrifice, not when they do the other deeds of the Law, but when
they attain to the forgiveness of sins. If then this hath been promised,
but has never yet happened in their case, nor have they ever enjoyed the
remission of sins by baptism, certainly it will come to pass. Hence he
proceeds,

<span id="vii.xxi-p65"></span>[Rom.
11.29](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#029.md)<span id="vii.xxi-p65.1"></span>.
“For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.”

<span id="vii.xxi-p66"></span>And even this is not all he says to solace
them, for he uses what had already come about. And what came in of
consequence, that he states as chiefly intended, putting it in these
words,

<span id="vii.xxi-p67"></span>[Rom.
11.28](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#028.md)<span id="vii.xxi-p67.1"></span>.
“As concerning the Gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but as
touching the election, they are beloved for the fathers’ sakes.”

<span id="vii.xxi-p68"></span>That the Gentile then might not be puffed
up, and say, “I am standing, do not tell me of what would have been, but
what has been,” he uses this consideration to bring him down, and says,
“As concerning the Gospel, they are enemies for your sakes.” For when
you were called they became more captious. Nevertheless God hath not
even now cut short the calling of you, but He waiteth for all the
Gentiles that are to believe to come in, and then they also shall come.
Then he does them another kind favor, by saying, “As touching election,
they are beloved for the fathers sakes.” And what is this? for wherein
they are enemies, punishment is theirs: but wherein they are beloved,
the virtue of their ancestors has no influence on them, if they do not
believe. Nevertheless, as I said, he ceaseth not to solace them with
words, that he may bring them over. Wherefore by way of fresh proof for
his former assertion, he says,

<span id="vii.xxi-p69"></span>[Rom.
11.30-32](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#030.md)<span
id="vii.xxi-p69.1"></span>. “For as ye in times past have not believed
God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief; even so have
these also now not believed, that through your mercy they may also
obtain mercy. For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that He might
have mercy upon all.”

<span id="vii.xxi-p70"></span>He shows here that those of the Gentiles
were called first. Then, as they would not come, the Jews were elected,
and the same result occurred again. For when the Jews would not believe,
again the Gentiles were brought over. And he does not stop here, nor
does he draw the whole to a conclusion at their rejection, but at their
having mercy shown them again. See how much he gives to those of the
Gentiles, as much as he did to the Jews before. For when ye, he would
say, “in times past did not obey,” being of the Gentiles, then the Jews
came in. Again, when these did not obey, ye have come. However, they
will not perish forever. “For God hath concluded them all in unbelief,”
that is, hath convinced them, hath shown them disobedient; not that they
may remain in disobedience, but that He may save the one by the
captiousness of the other, these by those and those by these. Now
consider; ye were disobedient, and they were saved. Again, they have
been disobedient, and ye have been saved. Yet ye have not been so saved
as to be put away again, as the Jews were, but so as to draw them over
through jealousy while ye abide.

<span id="vii.xxi-p71"></span>[Rom.
11.33](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#033.md)<span id="vii.xxi-p71.1"></span>.
“Oh, the depth of the riches, both of the wisdom and knowledge of God!
How unsearchable are His judgments!”

<span id="vii.xxi-p72"></span>Here after going back to former times, and
looking back to God’s original dispensation of things whereby the world
hath existed up to the present time, and having considered what special
provision He had made for all occurrences, he is stricken with awe, and
cries aloud, so making his hearers feel confident that certainly that
will come to pass which he saith. For he would not have cried aloud and
been awe-struck, unless this was quite sure to come to pass. That it is
a depth then, he knows: but how great, he knows not. For the language is
that of a person wondering, not of one that knew the whole. But admiring
and being awe-struck at the goodliness, so far forth as in him lay, he
heralds it forth by two intensitive words, riches and depth, and then is
awestruck at His having had both the will and the power to do all this,
and by opposites effecting opposites. “How unsearchable are His
judgments.” For they are not only impossible to be comprehended, but
even to be searched. “And His ways past finding out;” that is, His
dispensations for these also are not only impossible to be known, but
even to be sought into. For even I, he means, have not found out the
whole, but a little part, not all. For He alone knoweth His own clearly.
Wherefore he proceeds:

<span id="vii.xxi-p73"></span>[Rom.
11:34](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#034.md),
[35](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#035.md)<span id="vii.xxi-p73.1"></span>.
“For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been His
counsellor? Or who hath first given to Him, and it shall be recompensed
unto him again?”

<span id="vii.xxi-p74"></span>What he means is nearly this: that though
He is so wise, yet He has not His Wisdom from any other, but is Himself
the Fountain of good things. And though He hath done so great things,
and made us so great presents, yet it was not by borrowing from any
other that He gave them, but by making them spring forth from Himself;
nor as owing any a return for having received from him, but as always
being Himself the first to do the benefits; for this is a chief mark of
riches, to overflow abundantly, and yet need no aid. Wherefore he
proceeds to say, “For of Him, and through Him, and to Him, are all
things.” Himself devised, Himself created, Himself worketh together
(Vulg. <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xxi-p74.1"></span>συγκρατεἵ</span>, <span class="c14"><span
id="vii.xxi-p74.2"></span>mss.</span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xxi-p74.3"></span>συγκροτεἵ</span> ). For He is rich, and
needeth not to receive from another. And wise, and needeth no
counsellor. Why speak I of a counsellor? To know the things of Him is no
one able, save Himself alone, the Rich and Wise One. For it is proof of
much riches that He should make them of the Gentiles thus well supplied;
and of much wisdom that He should constitute the inferiors of the Jews
their teachers. Then as he was awe-struck he offers up thanksgiving also
in the word, “To Whom be glory forever. Amen.”

<span id="vii.xxi-p75"></span>For when he tells of any great and
unutterable thing of this kind, he ends in wonder with a doxology. And
this he does in regard to the Son also. For in that passage also he went
on to the very same thing that he does here. “Of whom is Christ
according to the flesh, Who is over all God blessed forever. Amen.
([Rom. ix. 5](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#005.md)<span
id="vii.xxi-p75.1"></span>.)

<span id="vii.xxi-p76"></span>Him then let us also imitate, and let us
glorify God in all things, by a heedful way of life, and let us not feel
confidence in the virtues of our ancestry, knowing the example that has
been made of the Jews. For this is not, certainly it is not, the
relationship of Christians, for theirs is the kinsmanship of the Spirit.
So the Scythian becometh Abraham’s son: and his son on the other hand
more of an alien to him than the Scythian. Let us not then feel
confidence in the well-doings of our fathers (most <span
class="c14"><span id="vii.xxi-p76.1"></span>mss.</span> “of others”),
but if you have a parent who is a marvel even, fancy not that this will
be enough to save you, or to get you honor and glory, unless you have
the relationship of character to him. So too if you have a bad one, do
not think that you will be condemned on this account, or be put to shame
if at least you order your own doings aright. For what can be less
honorable than the Gentiles? still in faith they soon became related to
the Saints. Or what more nearly connected than the Jews? Yet still by
unbelief they were made aliens. For that relationship is of nature and
necessity, after which we are all relations. For of Adam we all sprung,
and none can be more a relation than another, both as regards Adam and
as regards Noah, and as regards the earth, the common mother of all. But
the relationship worthy of honors, is that which does distinguish us
from the wicked. For it is not possible for all to be relations in this
way, but those of the same character only. Nor do we call them brothers
who come of the same labor with ourselves, but those who display the
same zeal. In this way Christ giveth men the name of children of God,
and so on the other hand children of the devil, and so too children of
disobedience, of hell, and of perdition likewise. So Timothy was Paul’s
son from goodness and was called “mine own son” <span
id="fr_1519"></span>[1520](#fn_1519.md) ([1 Tim. i.
2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#002)<span id="vii.xxi-p77.1"></span>.md):
but of his sister’s son we do not know even the name. And yet the one
was by nature related to him, and still that availed him not. But the
other being both by nature and country far removed from him (as being a
native of Lystra), still became most nearly related. Let us then also
become the sons of the Saints, or rather let us become even God’s sons.
For that it is possible to become sons of God, hear what he says, “Be ye
therefore perfect, as your father which is in Heaven.” ([Matt. v.
48](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#048)<span id="vii.xxi-p77.2"></span>..md)
This is why we call Him Father in prayer, and that not only to remind
ourselves of the grace, but also of virtue, that we may not do aught
unworthy of such a relationship. And how it may be said is it possible
to be a son of God? by being free from all passions, and showing
gentleness to them that affront and wrong us. For thy Father is so to
them that blaspheme Him. Wherefore, though He says various things at
various times, yet in no case does He say that ye may be like your
Father, but when He says, “Pray for them that despitefully use you, do
good to them that hate you” ([Matt.
5.44](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#044)<span id="vii.xxi-p77.3"></span>.md),
then He brings in this as the reward. For there is nothing that brings
us so near to God, and makes us so like Him, as this well-doing.
Therefore Paul also, when he says, “Be ye followers of God” (<span
id="vii.xxi-p77.4"></span>[Eph. v.
1](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#001)<span id="vii.xxi-p77.5"></span>.md),
means them to be so in this respect. For we have need of all good deeds,
chiefly however of love to man and gentleness, since we need so much of
His love to man ourselves. For we commit many transgressions every day.
Wherefore also we have need to show much mercy. But much and little is
not measured by the quantity of things given, but by the amount of the
givers’ means. Let not then the rich be high-minded, nor the poor
dejected as giving so little, for the latter often gives more than the
former. We must not then make ourselves miserable because we are poor,
since it makes alms-giving the easier for us. For he that has got much
together is seized with haughtiness, as well as a greater affection to
that (or “lust beyond that”) he has. But he that hath but a little is
quit of either of these domineering passions: hence he finds more
occasions for doing well. For this man will go cheerfully into a
prison-house, and will visit the sick, and will give a cup of cold
water. But the other will not take upon him any office of this sort, as
pampered up (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xxi-p77.6"></span>φλεγμαίνων</span>) by his riches. Be not then
out of heart at thy poverty. For thy poverty makes thy traffic for
heaven the easier to thee. And if thou have nothing, but have a
compassionating soul, even this will be laid up as a reward for thee.
Hence too Paul bade us “weep with them that weep” ([Rom. xii.
15](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#015)<span id="vii.xxi-p77.7"></span>.md),
and exhorted us to be to prisoners as though bound with them. ([Heb.
xiii. 3](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#003.md)<span
id="vii.xxi-p77.8"></span>.) For it is not to them that weep only that
it yieldeth some solace that there be many that compassionate them, but
to them who are in other afflicting circumstances. For there are cases
where conversation has as much power to recover him that is cast down as
money. For this then God exhorts us to give money to them that ask, not
merely with a view to relieve their poverty, but that He may teach us to
compassionate the misfortunes of our neighbors. For this also the
covetous man is odious, in that he not only disregards men in a beggared
state, but because he gets himself trained (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xxi-p77.9"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xxi-p77.10"></span>λείφεται</span>) for cruelty and great
inhumanity. And so he that, for their sakes, thinks little of money, is
even on this account an object of love, that he is merciful and kind to
man. And Christ, when He blesseth the merciful, blesseth and praiseth
not those only that give the alms of money, but those also who have the
will to do so. Let us then be so inclinable to mercy, and all other
blessings will follow, for he that hath a spirit of love and mercy, if
he have money, will give it away, or if he see any in distress, will
weep and bewail it; if he fall in with a person wronged, will stand up
for him; if he sees one spitefully entreated, will reach out his hand to
him. For as he has that treasure-house of blessings, a loving and
merciful soul, he will make it a fountain for all his brethren’s needs,
and will enjoy all the rewards that are laid up with God (Field with 4
<span class="c14"><span id="vii.xxi-p77.11"></span>mss.</span> <span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.xxi-p77.12"></span>τᾥ θεᾥ</span>). That we
then may attain to these, let us of all things frame our souls
accordingly. For so, while in this world, we shall do good deeds without
number, and shall enjoy the crowns to come. To which may we all attain
by the grace and love toward man, etc.

<span id="vii.xxi-p4"></span> Field punctuates so as to give the sense
“Why then hath not Israel attained to that which he seeketh after? Nay,
but the election hath obtained it;” which seems to be (at all events)
St. Chrysostom’s view of the passage.

id="vii.xxi-p5.2"></span>

<span id="vii.xxi-p6"></span> The course of thought here may be thus
exhibited: God in his gracious promise made simple faith the condition
of salvation, but Israel sought it in the line of works and has not
attained it. But the election obtained it because the avowed principle
of the election was grace, to which corresponds faith. In other words:
those who complied with the express principle of the election and who
sought salvation by faith, receiving it as a gift of divine grace, were
accepted. Those who thought to establish their own righteousness have
failed, and this failure corresponds to that judicial hardening with
which God through Moses and Isaiah threatens the disobedient Israelites
in the Old Testament.—G.B.S.

id="vii.xxi-p20.1"></span>

<span id="vii.xxi-p21"></span> The following paraphrase of the apostle’s
argument in [Rom. 11.16-24](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#016.md)<span
id="vii.xxi-p21.1"></span> by which he would show that the Jews’
rejection is but temporary may be serviceable in connection with the
exposition of Chrysostom: granting then that the Jews have sadly
stumbled, have they done so in order that (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xxi-p21.2"></span>ἵ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xxi-p21.3"></span>να</span>, according to a providential
intention) they may fall (completely away from God and be lost to all
hope)? No. There is a providential purpose in this sad lapse. God has
overruled it for the salvation of the Gentiles. When the Jews rejected
Christianity, then the gospel turned from them and went to the Gentiles,
so that the rejection of the Jews facilitated the conversion of the
heathen. And the acceptance of the Gentiles reacted again in favor of
the Jews because it provoked them to jealousy and so stimulated them to
accept the blessings which the Gentiles were receiving. Thus their fall
has a twofold beneficial effect, (*a*) on the Gentiles, (*b*) through
them on themselves. ([Rom.
11.11-12](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#011.md)<span
id="vii.xxi-p21.4"></span>) Now, if so much good can come out of their
fall, how much more out of their restoration! If their fault, by which
they come so far short of their ideal mission, could be such an
(indirect) blessing to the Gentiles, how much greater a blessing will
the repairing of that defect prove? ([Rom.
11.13-16](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#013.md)<span
id="vii.xxi-p21.5"></span>.) I say the return of the Jews will be a
great blessing to you, my Gentile Christian brethren, and I urge this
point with you. It is all to be to your advantage. In hoping and
laboring for the conversion of my own people, I am still laboring in the
line of my mission as apostle to the Gentiles. If I can save any of the
Jews and stimulate their jealousy so that they will be desirous of
availing themselves of the blessings of the gospel, I shall be doing the
greatest possible good to the Gentile world. Why? ([Rom.
11.15](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#015)<span id="vii.xxi-p21.6"></span>.md)
Because if their rejection is the “reconciliation of the world”—the
means of securing salvation to the Gentiles, their reception back again
shall be a veritable “resurrection from the dead,”—from it shall flow
streams of spiritual life, compared with which that indirect blessing
which sprang from their rejection is as nothing ([Rom.
11.16](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#016.md)<span
id="vii.xxi-p21.7"></span>). And such is the divine, final destination
of the Jewish people. They are still holy unto the Lord, a peculiar
possession, and cannot be finally and utterly cast away. ([Rom.
11.17-24](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#017.md)<span
id="vii.xxi-p21.8"></span>) Hence you Gentiles have no ground of
glorying over the Jews, either in the fact that some of them have been
cut off or that you have been grafted in. Israel is still the stock. At
most you are but branches and that wild-olive branches! If now you seize
upon what was said (in [Rom.
11.11-12](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#011.md)<span
id="vii.xxi-p21.9"></span>) and maintain that the Jews were rejected to
make place for you ([Rom. 11.19](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#019.md)<span
id="vii.xxi-p21.10"></span>), I reply that there is another to the
matter ([Rom. 11.20](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#020.md)<span
id="vii.xxi-p21.11"></span>). From the point of view of the divine
providence this is true, but from the point of view of the Jews’ own
action, unbelief explains their rejection. You have nothing to do with
God’s providential purposes in the case. What you have to do is to be
obedient and faithful. If you draw an assurance from the one view, I
shall draw a warning from the other and that too from the side with
which you have to do and for which you are responsible. “Be not
high-minded but fear.” God will deal with you on the same principles
upon which he has dealt with the Jews ([Rom.
11.21](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#021.md)<span
id="vii.xxi-p21.12"></span>). These dispensations reveal the two sides
of God’s nature—his severity toward disobedience and his goodness to all
who continue in relation to his goodness ([Rom.
11.22](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#022.md)<span
id="vii.xxi-p21.13"></span>). Those portions of the nation which have
been cut off shall be grafted in again unless they persist in unbelief
([Rom. 11.23](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#023.md)<span
id="vii.xxi-p21.14"></span>). And if the branches from a wild-olive tree
were grafted into the genuine olive tree, contrary to their nature, how
much more natural to suppose that the branches which originally belonged
to the true olive stock shall be returned and grafted again into that
stock to which they naturally belong ([Rom.
11.24](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#024.md)<span
id="vii.xxi-p21.15"></span>). There is no good ground for the opinion of
Chrys. ([Rom. 11.11](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#011.md)<span
id="vii.xxi-p21.16"></span>) that the salvation of Israel is to occur at
the second coming and the end of the world.—G.B.S.
