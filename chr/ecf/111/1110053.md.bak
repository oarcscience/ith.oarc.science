<span id="vi.xlviii-p1"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vi.xlviii-p1.1"></span>Homily XLVIII.</span>

<span id="vi.xlviii-p2"></span>[Acts XXII.
17-20](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#017.md)<span id="vi.xlviii-p2.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xlviii-p3"></span>“And it came to pass, that, when I was
come again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a
trance; and saw him saying unto me, Make haste, and get thee quickly out
of Jerusalem: for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me. And
I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue
them that believed on thee: and when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was
shed, I also was standing by, and consenting unto his death, and kept
the raiment of them that slew him.”

<span id="vi.xlviii-p4"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="vi.xlviii-p4.1"></span>See</span> how he thrusts himself (into
danger), I came, he says, after that vision, “to Jerusalem. I was in a
trance,” etc. Again, this is without witness: but observe, the witness
follows from the result. He said, “They will not receive thy testimony:”
they did not receive it. And yet from calculations of reason the surmise
should have been this, that they would assuredly receive him. For I was
the man that made war upon the Christians: so that they ought to have
received him. Here he establishes two things: both that they are without
excuse, since they persecuted him contrary to all likelihood or
calculation of reason; and, that Christ was God, as prophesying things
contrary to expectation, and as not looking to past things, but
fore-knowing the things to come. How then does He say, “He shall bear My
name before the Gentiles and kings and children of Israel?” (<span
id="vi.xlviii-p4.2"></span>[Acts ix.
15](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#015)<span id="vi.xlviii-p4.3"></span>..md)
Not, certainly persuade. Besides which, on other occasions we find the
Jews were persuaded, but here they were not. Where most of all they
ought to have been persuaded, as knowing his former zeal (in their
cause), here they were not persuaded. “And when the blood of Thy martyr
Stephen,” etc. See where again his discourse terminates, namely, in the
forcible main point (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xlviii-p4.4"></span>εἰς τὸ ἱσχυρὸν κεφάλαιον</span>): that it was
he that persecuted, and not only persecuted but killed, nay, had he ten
thousand hands (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xlviii-p4.5"></span>μυρίαις χερσὶν ἀναιρὥν</span>) would have
used them all to kill Stephen. He reminded them of the murderous spirit
heinously indulged (by him and them). Then of course above all they
would not endure him, since this convicted them; and truly the prophecy
was having its fulfilment: great the zeal, vehement the accusation, and
the Jews themselves witnesses of the truth of Christ! “And he said unto
me, Depart: for I will send thee far hence unto the Gentiles. And they
gave him audience unto this word, and then lifted up their voices, and
said, Away with such a fellow from the earth: for it is not fit that he
should live.” ([Acts 22:21](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#021.md),
[22](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#022)<span id="vi.xlviii-p4.6"></span>..md)
The Jews <span id="fr_1071"></span>[1072](#fn_1071.md) would not endure to
hear out all his harangue, <span id="fr_1072"></span>[1073](#fn_1072.md)
but excessively fired by their wrath, they shouted, it says, “Away with
him; for it is not fit that he should live. And as they cried out, and
cast off their clothes, and threw dust into the air, the tribune
commanded him to be brought into the castle, and bade that he should be
examined by scourging; that he might know wherefore they cried so
against him.” ([Acts 22:23](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#023.md),
[24](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#024)<span id="vi.xlviii-p6.1"></span>..md)
Whereas both the tribune ought to have examined whether these things
were so—yes, and the Jews themselves too—or, if they were not so, to
have ordered him to be scourged, he “bade examine him by scourging, that
he might know for what cause they so clamored against him.” And yet he
ought to have learnt from those clamorers, and to have asked whether
they laid hold upon aught of the things spoken: instead of that, without
more ado he indulges his arbitrary will and pleasure, and acts with a
view to gratify them: for he did not look to this, how he should do a
righteous thing, but only how he might stop their rage unrighteous as it
was. “And as they bound him with thongs, <span
id="fr_1073"></span>[1074](#fn_1073.md) Paul said unto the centurion that
stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman and
uncondemned?” ([Acts 22.25](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#025.md)<span
id="vi.xlviii-p7.4"></span>.) Paul lied not, God forbid: for he was a
Roman: <span id="fr_1074"></span>[1075](#fn_1074.md) if there was nothing
else, he would have been afraid (to pretend this), lest he should be
found out, and suffer a worse punishment. (See Sueton. Vit. Claud. §25.)
And observe he does not say it peremptorily (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xlviii-p8.1"></span>ἁ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xlviii-p8.2"></span>πλὥς</span>), but, “Is it lawful for you?”
The charges brought are two, both its being without examination, and his
being a Roman. They held this as a great privilege, at that time: for
they say that (it was only) from the time of Hadrian that all <span
id="fr_1075"></span>[1076](#fn_1075.md) were named Romans, but of old it
was not so. He would have been contemptible had he been scourged: but as
it is, he puts *them* into greater fear (than they him). Had they
scourged him, they would also have dismissed <span
id="fr_1076"></span>[1077](#fn_1076.md) the whole matter, or even have
killed him; but as it is, the result is not so. See how God permits many
(good results) to be brought about quite in a human way, both in the
case of the Apostles and of the rest (of mankind). Mark how they
suspected the thing to be a pretext, <span
id="fr_1077"></span>[1078](#fn_1077.md) and that in calling himself a
Roman, Paul lied: perhaps surmising this from his poverty. “When the
centurion heard that, he went and told the tribune, saying, Take heed
what thou doest: for this man is a Roman. Then the tribune came, and
said unto him, Tell me, art thou a Roman? He said, Yea. And the tribune
answered, With a great sum obtained I this freedom. And Paul said, But I
was free born. Then straightway they departed from him which should have
examined him: and the tribune also was afraid, after he knew that he was
a Roman, and because he had bound him.” ([Acts
22.26-29](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#026.md)<span
id="vi.xlviii-p11.4"></span>.)—“But I,” he says, “was free born.” So
then his father also was a Roman. What then comes of this? He bound him,
and brought him down to the Jews. <span
id="fr_1078"></span>[1079](#fn_1078.md) “On the morrow, because he would
have known the certainty whereof he was accused of the Jews, he loosed
him from his bands, and commanded the chief priests and all their
council to appear, and brought Paul down, and set him before them.”
([Acts 22.30](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#030.md)<span
id="vi.xlviii-p12.1"></span>.) He discourses not now to the multitude,
nor to the people. “And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men
and brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this
day.” ([Acts 23.1](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#001.md)<span
id="vi.xlviii-p12.2"></span>.) What he means is this: I am not conscious
to myself of having wronged you at all, or of having done anything
worthy of these bonds. What then said the high priest? <span
id="fr_1079"></span>[1080](#fn_1079.md) Right justly, and ruler-like, and
mildly: “And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to
smite him on the mouth. Then said Paul unto him, God shall smite thee,
thou whited wall: for sittest thou to judge me after the law, and
commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law? And they that stood by
said, Revilest thou God’s high priest? Then said Paul, I wist not,
brethren, that he was the high priest: for it is written, Thou shalt not
speak evil of the ruler of thy people.” <span
id="fr_1080"></span>[1081](#fn_1080.md) ([Acts
23.3-5](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#003.md)<span
id="vi.xlviii-p14.5"></span>.) Because “I knew not that he was high
priest.” Some say, Why then does he defend himself as if it was matter
of accusation, and adds, “Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy
people?” For if he were not the ruler, was it right for no better reason
than that to abuse (him or any) other? He says himself, “Being reviled,
we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it” (<span
id="vi.xlviii-p14.6"></span>[1 Cor. iv.
12](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#012)<span id="vi.xlviii-p14.7"></span>.md);
but here he does the contrary, and not only reviles, but curses. <span
id="fr_1081"></span>[1082](#fn_1081.md) They are the words of boldness,
rather than of anger; he did not choose to appear in a contemptible
light to the tribune. For suppose the tribune himself had spared to
scourge him, only as he was about to be delivered up to the Jews, his
being beaten by their servants would have more emboldened him: this is
why Paul does not attack the servant, but the person who gave the order.
But that saying, “Thou whited wall, and dost thou sit to judge me after
the law?” (is) instead of, Being (thyself) a culprit: as if he had said,
And (thyself) worthy of stripes without number. See accordingly how
greatly they were struck with his boldness; for whereas the point was to
have overthrown the whole matter, they rather commend him. <span
id="fr_1082"></span>[1083](#fn_1082) (*infra,* v. 9..md) “For it is
written,” etc. He wishes to show that he thus speaks, not from fear, nor
because (Ananias) did not deserve to be called this, but from obedience
to the law in this point also. And indeed I am fully persuaded that he
did not know that it was the high priest, <span
id="fr_1083"></span>[1084](#fn_1083.md) since he had returned now after a
long interval, and was not in the habit of constant intercourse with the
Jews; seeing him too in the midst among many others: for the high priest
was no longer easy to be seen at a glance, there being many of them and
diverse. <span id="fr_1084"></span>[1085](#fn_1084.md) So, it seems to me,
in this also he spoke with a view to his plea against them: by way of
showing that he does obey the law; therefore he (thus) exculpates
himself.

<span id="vi.xlviii-p19"></span>(Recapitulation.) (*b*) But let us
review what has been said. (*a*) “And when I was came again to
Jerusalem,” etc. ([Acts 22.17](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#017.md)<span
id="vi.xlviii-p19.1"></span>.) How was it, <span
id="fr_1085"></span>[1086](#fn_1085.md) that being a Jew, and there brought
up and taught, he did not stay there? Nor did he abide there, unless he
had a mind to furnish numberless occasions against him: everywhere just
like an exile, fleeing about from place to place. (*c*) “While I prayed
in the temple,” he says, “it came to pass that I was in a trance.” (To
show) that it was not simply a phantom of the imagination, therefore
“while he prayed” (the Lord) stood by him. And he shows that it was not
from fear of their dangers that he fled, but because they would “not
receive” his “testimony.” ([Acts
22.18](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#018.md)<span
id="vi.xlviii-p20.11"></span>.) But why said he “They know I
imprisoned?” ([Acts 22.19](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#019.md)<span
id="vi.xlviii-p20.12"></span>.) Not to gainsay Christ, but because he
wished to learn this which was so contrary to all reasonable
expectation. Christ, however, did not teach him (this), <span
id="fr_1086"></span>[1087](#fn_1086.md) but only bade him depart, and he
obeys: so obedient is he. “And they lifted up their voices,” it says,
“and said, Away with him: it is not fit that this fellow should live.”
([Acts 22.22](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#022.md)<span
id="vi.xlviii-p21.2"></span>.) Nay, ye are the persons not fit to live;
not he, who in everything obeys God. O villains and murderers! “And
shaking out their clothes,” it says, “they threw dust into the air”
([Acts 22.23](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#023.md)<span
id="vi.xlviii-p21.3"></span>), to make insurrection more fierce, because
they wished to frighten the governor. <span
id="fr_1087"></span>[1088](#fn_1087.md) And observe; they do not say what
the charge was, as in fact they had nothing to allege, but only think to
strike terror by their shouting. “The tribune commanded,” etc. and yet
he ought to have learnt from the accusers, “wherefore they cried so
against him. And as they bound him, etc. And the chief captain was
afraid, after he learnt that he was a Roman.” Why then it was no
falsehood. “On the morrow, because he would know the certainty wherefore
he was accused of the Jews, etc., he brought him down before the
council.” ([Acts 22.24-30](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#024.md)<span
id="vi.xlviii-p22.1"></span>.) This he should have done at the outset.
He brought him in, loosed. This above all the Jews would not know what
to make of. <span id="fr_1088"></span>[1089](#fn_1088.md) “And Paul,” it
says, “earnestly beholding them.” It shows his boldness, and how it awed
them (<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xlviii-p23.2"></span>τὸ
ἐντρεπτικόν</span>). “Then the high priest Ananias.” etc. ([Acts
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#001.md),
[2](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#002)<span id="vi.xlviii-p23.3"></span>..md)
Why, what has he said that was affronting? What is he beaten for? Why
what hardihood, what shamelessness! Therefore (Paul) set him down (with
a rebuke): “God shall smite thee thou whited wall.” ([Acts
23.3](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#003.md)<span
id="vi.xlviii-p23.4"></span>.) Accordingly (Ananias) himself is put to a
stand, and dares not say a word: only those about him could not bear
Paul’s boldness. They saw a man ready to die <span
id="fr_1089"></span>[1090](#fn_1089.md) \* \* \* for if this was the case,
(Paul) had but to hold his peace, and the tribune would have taken him,
and gone his way; he would have sacrificed him to them. He both shows
that he suffers willingly what he suffers, and thus excuses himself
before them, not that he wished to excuse himself to them—since as for
those, he even strongly condemns them—but for the sake of the
people. <span id="fr_1090"></span>[1091](#fn_1090.md) “Violating the law,
commandest thou me to be beaten?” Well may he say so: for to kill a man
who had done (them) no injury, and that an innocent person, was a
violating of the law. For neither was it abuse that was spoken by him,
unless one would call Christ’s words abusive, when He says, “Woe unto
you, Scribes and Pharisees, for ye are like unto whited walls.” ([Matt.
xxiii. 27](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#027.md)<span
id="vi.xlviii-p25.3"></span>.) True, you will say: but if he had said it
before he had been beaten, it would have betokened not anger, but
boldness. But I have mentioned the reason of this. <span
id="fr_1091"></span>[1092](#fn_1091) And (at this rate.md) we often find
Christ Himself “speaking abusively” to the Jews when abused by them; as
when He says, “Do not think that I will accuse you.” ([John v.
45](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#045)<span id="vi.xlviii-p26.3"></span>..md)
But this is not abuse, God forbid. See, with what gentleness he
addresses these men: “I wist not,” he says, “that he was God’s high
priest” ([Acts 23:4](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#004.md),
[5](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#005)<span id="vi.xlviii-p26.4"></span>.md):
and, (to show) that he was not dissembling (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xlviii-p26.5"></span>εἰρωνεύεται</span>) he adds, “Thou shalt not
speak evil of the ruler of thy people.” He even confesses him to be
still ruler. Let us also learn the gentleness also, <span
id="fr_1092"></span>[1093](#fn_1092.md) that in both the one and the other
we may be perfect. For one must look narrowly into them, to learn what
the one is and what the other: narrowly, because these virtues have
their corresponding vices hard by them: mere forwardness passing itself
off for boldness, mere cowardice for gentleness: <span
id="fr_1093"></span>[1094](#fn_1093.md) and need being to scan them, lest
any person possessing the vice should seem to have the virtue: which
would be just as if a person should fancy that he was cohabiting with
the mistress, and not know that it was the servant-maid. What then is
gentleness, and what mere cowardice? When others are wronged, and we do
not take their part, but hold our peace, this is cowardice: when we are
the persons ill-treated, and we bear it, this is gentleness. What is
boldness? Again the same, when others are the persons for whom we
contend. What forwardness? When it is in our own cause that we are
willing to fight. So that magnanimity and boldness go together, as also
(mere) forwardness and (mere) cowardice. For he that (does not) resent
on his own behalf, <span id="fr_1094"></span>[1095](#fn_1094.md) will
hardly but resent on behalf of others: and he that does not stand up for
his own cause, will hardly fail to stand up for others. For when our
habitual disposition is pure from passion, it admits virtue also. Just
as a body when free from fever admits strength, so the soul, unless it
be corrupted by the passions, admits strength. It betokens great
strength, this gentleness; it needs a generous and a gallant soul, and
one of exceeding loftiness, this gentleness. Or, think you, is it a
small thing to suffer ill, and not be exasperated? Indeed one would not
err if in speaking of the disposition to stand up for our neighbors, one
should call it the spirit of manly courage. For he that has had the
strength to be able to overcome so strong a passion (as this of
selfishness), will have the strength to dare the attack on another. For
instance, these are two passions, cowardice and anger: if thou have
overcome anger, it is very plain that thou overcomest cowardice also:
but thou gettest the mastery over anger, by being gentle: therefore (do
so) with cowardice also, and thou wilt be manly. Again, if thou hast not
got the better of anger, thou art become forward and pugnacious; but not
having got the better of this, neither canst thou get the better of
fear; consequently, thou wilt be a coward too: and the case is the same
as with the body; if it be weak, it is quickly overcome both by cold and
heat: for such is the ill temperament, but the good temperament is able
to stand all (changes). Again, greatness of soul is a virtue, and hard
by it stands prodigality: economy is a virtue, the being a good manager;
hard by it stands parsimony and meanness. Come, let us again collate and
compare the virtues (with their vices). Well, then, the prodigal person
is not to be called great-minded. How should he? The man who is overcome
by numberless passions, how should he be great of soul? For this is not
despising money; it is only the being ordered about by other passions:
for just as a man, if he were at the beck and bidding of robbers to obey
their orders, could not be free (so it is here). His large spending does
not come of his contempt of money, but simply from his not knowing how
to dispose of it properly: else, were it possible both to keep it and to
lay it out on his pleasure, this is what he would like. But he that
spends his money on fit objects, this is the man of high soul: for it is
truly a high soul, that which is not in slavery to passion, which
accounts money to be nothing. Again, economy is a good thing: for thus
that will be the best manager, who spends in a proper manner, and not at
random without management. But parsimony is not the same thing with
this. For the former <span id="fr_1095"></span>[1096](#fn_1095.md) indeed,
not even when an urgent necessity demands, touches the principal of his
money: but the latter will be brother to the former. Well, then, we will
put together the man of great soul, and the prudent economist, as also
the prodigal and the mean man: for both of these are thus affected from
littleness of soul, as those others are (from the opposite). Let us not
then call him high-souled, who simply spends, but him who spends aright:
nor let us call the economical manager mean and parsimonious, but him
who is unseasonably sparing of his money.

<span id="vi.xlviii-p31"></span>What a quantity of wealth that rich man
spent, “who was clothed in purple and fine linen?” (<span
id="vi.xlviii-p31.1"></span>[Luke xvi.
19](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#019)<span id="vi.xlviii-p31.2"></span>..md)
But he was not high-souled: for his soul was possessed by an unmerciful
disposition and by numberless lusts: how then should it be great?
Abraham had a great soul, spending as he did for the reception of his
guests, killing the calf, and, where need was, not only not sparing his
property, but not even his life. If then we see a person having his
sumptuous table, having his harlots and his parasites, let us not call
him a man of a great mind, but a man of an exceedingly little mind. For
see how many passions he is enslaved and subject to—gluttony, inordinate
pleasure, flattery: but him who is possessed by so many, and cannot even
escape one of them, how can any one call magnanimous? Nay, then most of
all let us call him little-minded, when he spends the most: for the more
he spends, the more does he show the tyranny of those passions: for had
they not excessively got the mastery over him, he would not have spent
to excess. Again, if we see a person, giving nothing to such people as
these, but feeding the poor, and succoring those in need, himself
keeping a mean table—him let us call an exceedingly high-souled man: for
it is truly a mark of a great soul, to despise one’s own comfort, but to
care for that of others. For tell me, if you should see a person
despising all tyrants, and holding their commands of no account, but
rescuing from their tyranny those who are oppressed and evil entreated;
would you not think this a great man? So let us account of the man in
this case also. The passions are the tyrant: if then we despise them, we
shall be great: but if we rescue others also from them, we shall be far
greater, as being sufficient not only for ourselves, but for others
also. But if any one, at a tyrant’s bidding, beat some other of his
subjects, is this greatness of soul? No, indeed: but the extreme of
slavery, in proportion as he is great. And now also there is set before
us (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xlviii-p31.3"></span>πρόκειται</span>) a soul that is a noble one
and a free: but this the prodigal has ordered to be beaten by his
passions: the man then that beats himself, shall we call high-souled? By
no means. Well then \* \*, but let us see what is greatness of soul, and
what prodigality; what is economy, and what meanness; what is
gentleness, and (what) dulness and cowardice; what boldness, and what
forwardness: that having distinguished these things from each other, we
may be enabled to pass (this life) well-pleasing to the Lord, and to
attain unto the good things promised, through the grace and mercy of our
Lord Jesus Christ, to Whom be the glory for ever and ever. Amen.

<span id="vi.xlviii-p5"></span> The sense is confused in old text by
misplacing the portions of sacred text. Mod. text “witnesses of the
truth of Christ speaking boldly. But the Jews,” etc. [Acts

<span id="fn_1072"></span>[i:1073](1110053.htm#fr_1072.md) <span
id="vi.xlviii-p5.3"></span>

<span id="vi.xlviii-p6"></span> The words, “I will send thee to the
*Gentiles,*” were those at which the Jews took offence. That a word
should come from heaven to Paul in the Temple, commanding him to leave
the chosen people and the Holy City and go to the uncircumcised heathen,
was a statement verging upon blasphemy. This admission they would regard
as proof of Paul’s apostasy from Moses. It implied that he regarded the
heathen as standing upon the same plane as themselves. The thought
roused all their native bigotry. Beyond “this word” they would not hear
him, nor did they think that one who should so estimate the privileges
and character of the Jews as compared with the Gentiles was fit to
live.—G.B.S.

<span id="fn_1073"></span>[i:1074](1110053.htm#fr_1073.md) <span

<span id="vi.xlviii-p7"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xlviii-p7.1"></span>Προέτειναν ἀυτὸν τοῖς ἱμᾶσιν</span> is
commonly rendered, as here, “When they stretched him out, or bound him
with thongs.” But this rendering seems to overlook the force of <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xlviii-p7.2"></span>πρό</span> in the verb
and the force of the article <span class="Greek"><span

seems to be, (Thayer’s Lex.): “When they had stretched him out for the
thongs, i.e. to receive the blows of the thongs, by tying him up to a
beam or pillar.” (So Meyer, DeWette, Lechler, Gloag).—G.B.S.

<span id="vi.xlviii-p8"></span> Mod. text entirely mistaking the sense,

have been afraid to be condemned for this, etc.

<span id="vi.xlviii-p9"></span> Meaning that all provincial subjects of
the Roman Empire came to be called Romans, only in the time of this
Emperor: therefore in St. Paul’s time it was a great thing to be able to
call one’s self a Roman. If it means, “All the citizens of Tarsus,” the
remark is not apposite. Certain it is that Tarsus, an *urbs libera* by
favor of M. Anthony, enjoyed neither *jus coloniarum* nor *jus
civitatis* until long afterwards, and the Apostle was not a Roman
because a citizen of Tarsus. This however is not the point of St.
Chrysostom’s remark. In the Catena and Œcumen. it will be seen, that in
later times the extended use of the name “Roman” as applied to all
subjects of the Roman Empire made a difficulty in the understanding of
this passage. Thus Ammonius takes it that St. Paul was a “Roman,”
because a native of Tarsus which was subject to the Romans (so Œc.): and
that the Jews themselves for the like reason were Romans; but these
scorned the appellation as a badge of servitude; Paul on the contrary
avouched it, setting an example of submission to the powers that
be.—After this sentence mod. text interpolates, “Or also he called
himself a Roman to escape punishment: for,” etc.

<span id="vi.xlviii-p17"></span> Other interpretations are given in the
Catena and Œcum. “Anonym.: The high priest being a hypocrite deserved to
be called a ‘whited wall.’ Whence also Paul says he did not even know
him as high priest, since it is the work of a high priest to save the
flock put under his charge: but this man made havoc upon it, etc.
Severus: Paul justly reproached him, but then, as if repenting, said: ‘I
knew not,’ etc. Not know that he was high priest? Then how saidst thou,
‘And sittest thou to judge me?’—But he pretends ignorance: an ignorance
which does no harm, but is an ‘economy’ (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xlviii-p17.1"></span>οἰκονομοῦσαν</span>): for reserve (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xlviii-p17.2"></span>μεταχειρισμὸς</span>)
may be more forcible than speaking out (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xlviii-p17.3"></span>παρρησία</span>): an unseasonable <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xlviii-p17.4"></span>παρρησία</span> often

<span id="fn_1084"></span>[i:1085](1110053.htm#fr_1084.md) <span
id="vi.xlviii-p17.6"></span>

<span id="vi.xlviii-p18"></span> Other methods of dealing with Paul’s
much debated statement: “I did not know that he was the high priest,”
besides the view given in the text (with which agree Beza, Wolff,
Lechler, *et al.*) are: (1) Paul did not perceive who it was that
addressed him and thus did not know that it was the high priest whom he
rebuked (Alford). (2) Paul did not acknowledge Ananias to be high
priest; he would not recognize so unjust a man as a real high priest
(Calvin, Meyer, Stier). (3) Ananias was not high priest at this time
(Lightfoot, Whiston, Lewin). (4) Paul did not recollect or consider that
it was the high priest whom he was addressing (Bengel, Olshausen,
Neander, Schaff, Hackett, Conybeare and Howson, Gloag). In this view
Paul apologizes for his rash words, spoken inadvertently and without
reflection, by adding: “for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of
the ruler of thy people.” Baur and Zeller suppose that the apostle never
said what he is reported as saying. The choice appears to lie between
views (2) and (4).—G.B.S.

<span id="fn_1085"></span>[i:1086](1110053.htm#fr_1085.md) <span
id="vi.xlviii-p19.2"></span>

<span id="vi.xlviii-p20"></span> Mod. text omits the whole of the
portion marked (*a*). The sense is: St. Paul is concerned to explain how
it was that having been bred and taught in Jerusalem, he did not remain
there. It was by command of Christ in a vision that he departed. In fact
he could not stay there unless, etc. Accordingly we find him everywhere
fleeing about from place to place, like one exiled from his own land.
The words which are corrupt, are: <span class="Greek"><span

<span id="vi.xlviii-p21"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xlviii-p21.1"></span>τὸ οὕτω παράδοξον</span>, viz. that the Jews
would not receive the testimony of one, who from his known history had,
of all men, the greatest claim to be heard by them: “‘Lord, they know,’
etc., therefore surely they will listen to me.” (So St. Chrysostom
constantly interprets these words: see *Cat. in loco.*) But Christ did
not gratify his wish for information on this point: He only bade him
depart.—The innovator, who has greatly disfigured this Homily by
numerous interpolations, has here: “did not teach him what he must do.”

<span id="vi.xlviii-p22"></span> Better: “they cast off their clothes”
as a signal of their anger and readiness to stone Paul. Others
understand it to mean: waving their garments as a signal of their assent
to the exclamations against Paul of those who were near.—G.B.S.

<span id="fn_1088"></span>[i:1089](1110053.htm#fr_1088.md) <span

id="vi.xlviii-p23.1"></span>τοῦτο μάλιστα ἠπόρησαν ἂν οἱ
᾽Ιουδαῖοι</span>: i.e. perhaps “they would be at a loss to know the
reason of his being brought before them loosed, not knowing what had
passed between him and the tribune.” Mod. text amplifies: “This he ought
to have done at the outset, and neither to have bound him, nor have
wished to scourge him, but to have left him, as having done nothing such
as that he should be put in bonds. ‘And he loosed him,’ it says, etc.
This above all the Jews knew not what to make of.”

κἂν ἐσίγησεν· καὶ λαβὼν αὐτὸν ἀπῆλθεν· κἂν ἐξέδωκεν αὐτὸν αὐτοῖς ὁ
χιλίαρχος</span>. The meaning (see above p. 289.) may be: “The wrong was
not to be put up with, for to hold his peace under such treatment would
have been to embolden the tribune to sacrifice him to his enemies, as a
person who might be insulted with impunity.” But the passage is corrupt:
perhaps it should be <span class="Greek"><span

“They did not see before them one who was willing to die, i.e. to let
them take away his life. For if this were the case, he had but to hold
his peace, and the tribune would,” etc. Mod. text “In such wise saw they
a man ready to die; and they would not endure it. ‘I knew not that he
was the high priest.’ Why then: the rebuke was of ignorance. For if this
were not the case, <span class="Greek"><span

<span id="vi.xlviii-p25"></span> Mod. text quite perverting the sense:
“Obeying the law, not from a wish to show (<span class="Greek"><span

to let the tribune despise him, p. 289. And so mod. text adds, <span

class="Greek"><span id="vi.xlviii-p28.4"></span>παρρησία</span> “courage
in speaking one’s mind,” is not merely “audacity,” or “hardihood,” or
“pugnacity,” or “the spirit of the bully,” though it may be applied to
all these. On the whole, “forwardness” seems to be most suitable for the
antithesis: the one character comes forward boldly and speaks up in the
cause of truth and justice; the other thrusts itself forward, in its own
cause, for resentment of wrongs done to one’s self. Below, in connection
