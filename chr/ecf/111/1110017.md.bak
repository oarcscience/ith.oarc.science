<span id="vi.xii"></span> <span id="vi.xii-p0.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xii-p1"></span>[Acts
4:36](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#036.md),
[37](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#037.md)<span id="vi.xii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xii-p2"></span>And Joses, who by the Apostles was surnamed
Barnabas (which is, being interpreted, The son of consolation), a
Levite, and of the country of Cyprus, having land, sold it, and brought
the money, and laid it at the Apostles’ feet.”

<span id="vi.xii-p3"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="vi.xii-p3.1"></span>The</span> writer is now about to relate the
affair of Ananias and Sapphira, and in order to show that the man’s sin
was of the worst description, he first mentions him who performed the
virtuous deed; that, there being so great a multitude all doing the
same, so great grace, so great miracles, he, taught by none of these,
but blinded by covetousness, brought destruction upon his own head.
“Having land,—meaning that this was all he possessed,—sold it, and
brought the money, and laid it at the Apostles’ feet. But a certain man
named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession, and kept back
part of the price, his wife also being privy to it, and brought a
certain part, and laid it at the Apostles’ feet.” ([Acts
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#001.md),
[2](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#002)<span id="vi.xii-p3.2"></span>..md) The
aggravating circumstance was, that the sin was concerted, and none other
saw what was done. How came it into the mind of this hapless wretch to
commit this crime? “But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thine
heart to lie to the Holy Ghost, and to keep back part of the price of
the land?” ([Acts 5.3](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#003.md)<span
id="vi.xii-p3.3"></span>.) Observe even in this, a great miracle
performed, greater far than the former. “Whiles it remained,” says he,
“was it not thine own? and after it was sold, was it not in thine own
power?” ([Acts 5.4](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#004.md)<span
id="vi.xii-p3.4"></span>.) That is, “Was there any obligation and force?
do we constrain you against your will?” “Why hast thou conceived this
thing in thine heart? thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God. And
Ananias hearing these words fell down, and gave up the ghost.” ([Acts
5.5](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#005)<span id="vi.xii-p3.5"></span>..md)
This miracle is greater than that of the lame man, in respect of the
death inflicted, and the knowing what was in the thought of the heart,
even what was done in secret. <span id="fr_289"></span>[290](#fn_289.md)
“And great fear came on all them that heard these things. And the young
men arose, and wound him up, and carried him out, and buried him. And it
was about the space of three hours after, when his wife, not knowing
what was done, came in. And Peter answered unto her, Tell me whether ye
sold the land for so much?” ([Acts
5.6-8](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#006)<span id="vi.xii-p4.1"></span>..md)
The woman he would fain save, for the man had been the author of the
sin: therefore he gives her time to clear herself, and opportunity for
repentance, saying, “Tell me whether ye sold the land for so much? And
she said, Yea, for so much. Then Peter said unto her, How is it that ye
have agreed together to tempt the Holy Ghost? Behold, the feet of them
which have buried thy husband are at the door, and shall carry thee out.
Then she fell down straightway at his feet, and yielded up the ghost;
and the young men came in, and found her dead, and, carrying her forth,
buried her by her husband. And great fear came upon all the Church, and
upon as many as heard these things.” ([Acts
5.9-11](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#009)<span id="vi.xii-p4.2"></span>..md)

<span id="vi.xii-p5"></span>After this fear had come upon them, he
wrought more miracles; both Peter and the rest; “And by the hands of the
Apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people; and they
were all with one accord in Solomon’s porch. And of the rest durst no
man join himself to them,” i.e. to the Apostles; “but the people
magnified them,” i.e. the Jewish people. If <span
id="fr_290"></span>[291](#fn_290.md) “no man durst join himself unto them,”
the Apostles, “there were,” however, “the more added unto the Lord,
believers, multitudes both of men and of women, insomuch that they
brought out into the streets their impotent folk, and laid them upon
couches and beds, that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by might
overshadow some of them.” ([Acts
5.12-15](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#012.md)<span
id="vi.xii-p6.9"></span>.) For Peter was the wonderful one, and he to
whom they more gave heed both because of his public harangue, the first
and the second and the third, and because of the miracle; for he it was
that wrought the miracle, the first, the second, the third: for the
present miracle was twofold: first, the convicting the thoughts of the
heart, and next the inflicting of death at his word of command. “That at
the least the shadow of Peter passing by,” etc. This had not occurred in
the history of Christ; but see here what He had told them actually
coming to pass, that “they which believe on Me, the works that I do
shall they do also; and greater works than these shall they do.” (<span
id="vi.xii-p6.10"></span>[John xiv.
12](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#012)<span id="vi.xii-p6.11"></span>..md)
“There came also a multitude out of the cities round about unto
Jerusalem, bringing sick folks, and them that were vexed with unclean
spirits; and they were healed every one.” ([Acts
5.16](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#016)<span id="vi.xii-p6.12"></span>..md)

<span id="vi.xii-p7"></span>And now I would have you observe the way in
which their whole life is interwoven. First there was despondency on
account of Christ taken from them, and then came joy because of the
Spirit descending upon them; again, dejection because of the scoffers,
and then joy in the result of their own apology. And here again we find
both dejection and gladness. In that they were become conspicuous, and
that God made revelations to them, there was gladness: in that they had
cut off some of their own company, there was sadness. Once more: again
there is gladness upon their success, and again sadness by reason of the
High Priest. And so it will be seen to be the case throughout. And the
same will be found to hold in the case of the ancient saints
likewise.—But let us look over again what has been said.

<span id="vi.xii-p8"></span>“They sold them,” it is written, “and
brought the prices, and laid them down at the Apostles’ feet.”
(Recapitulation. [Acts 4.34-37](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#034.md)<span
id="vi.xii-p8.1"></span>.) See, my beloved brethren, how instead of
leaving the Apostles to sell, they themselves sold, and presented the
prices to them. “But <span id="fr_291"></span>[292](#fn_291.md) a certain
man named Ananias,” etc. ([Acts
5.1](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#001)<span id="vi.xii-p9.1"></span>..md)
This history touches Bishops too, and very forcibly. And the wife of
Ananias was privy to the thing done: therefore he examines her. But
perhaps some one will say that he dealt very harshly with her. What do
you mean? What harshness? If for gathering sticks a man is to be stoned,
much rather ought he for sacrilege; for this money was become sacred. He
that has chosen to sell his goods and distribute them, and then
withdraws them, is guilty of sacrilege. But if he is sacrilegious, who
resumes from his own, much more he who takes from what is not his own.
And do not think that because the consequence is not now the same, the
crime will go unpunished. Do you see that this is the charge brought
against Ananias, that having made the money sacred, he afterwards
secreted it? Couldest thou not, said Peter, after selling thy land, use
the proceeds as thine own? Wast thou forbidden? Wherefore after thou
hadst promised it? See how at the very beginning, the devil made his
attack; in the very midst of such signs and wonders, how this man was
hardened! Something of the same kind had happened upon a time in the Old
Testament. The son of Charmi coveted the devoted thing: for observe
there also what vengeance ensues upon the sin. Sacrilege, beloved, is a
most grievous crime, insulting, and full of contempt. We neither obliged
thee to sell, the Apostle says, nor to give thy money when thou hadst
sold; of thine own free choice thou didst it; why hast thou then stolen
from the sacred treasury? “Why,” he says, “hath Satan filled thine
heart?” ([Acts 5.3](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#003.md)<span
id="vi.xii-p9.2"></span>.) Well, if Satan did the thing, why is the man
made guilty of it? For admitting the influence of the devil, and being
filled with it. You will say, they ought to have corrected him. But he
would not have received correction; for he that has seen such things as
he had seen, and is none the better, would certainly be none the better
for anything else that could be done; the matter was not one to be
simply passed over: like a gangrene, it must be cut out, that it might
not infect the rest of the body. As it is, both the man himself is
benefitted in regard that he is not left to advance further in
wickedness, and the rest, in that they are made more earnest; otherwise
the contrary would have ensued. In the next place, Peter proves him
guilty, and shows that the deed was not hidden from him, and then
pronounces the sentence. But wherefore, upon what purpose hast thou done
this? Didst thou wish to keep it? Thou oughtest to have kept it all
along, and never to have professed to give it. The sacrilege, beloved,
is a grievous one. For another, it may be, coveted what was not his own:
but it was at thy discretion to keep what was thine own. Why then didst
thou first make it sacred, and then take it? Out of excessive contempt
hast thou done this. The deed does not admit of pardon, it is past
pleading for.—Therefore let it be no stumbling-block to any, if at
present also there are sacrilegious persons. If there were such persons
then, much more now, when evils are many. But let us “rebuke them before
all, that others also may fear.” ([1 Tim. v.
20](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#020)<span id="vi.xii-p9.3"></span>..md)
Judas was sacrilegious, but it was no stumbling-block to the disciples.
Do you see how many evils spring from love of money? “And great fear, it
is said, came on all them that heard these things.” ([Acts
5.5](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#005)<span id="vi.xii-p9.4"></span>..md)
That man was punished, and others profited thereby. Not without cause.
And yet, signs had been wrought before: true, but there was not such a
sense of fear. So true is that saying, “The Lord is known by executing
judgments.” ([Ps. ix. 16](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#016.md)<span
id="vi.xii-p9.5"></span>.) The same thing had occurred in the case of
the Ark: Uzzah was punished and fear came upon the rest. (<span
id="vi.xii-p9.6"></span>[2 Sam. vi.
7](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#007)<span id="vi.xii-p9.7"></span>..md) But
in that instance the king through fear removed from him the Ark; but
here the disciples became more earnestly heedful. \[“And it was about
the space of three hours after, when his wife, not knowing what was
done, came in,” etc.\] ([Acts 5.7](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#007.md)<span
id="vi.xii-p9.8"></span>.) But observe how Peter, instead of sending for
her, waited till she entered; and how none of the others durst carry out
the intelligence. Such the teacher’s awfulness, such the disciples’
reverence, such the obedience! “An interval of three hours,”—and yet the
woman did not hear of it, and none of those present reported it,
although there was time enough for it to be noised abroad; but they were
afraid. This circumstance the Evangelist relates with wonder even, when
he says, “Not knowing what was done, came in.” “And Peter answered unto
her,” etc. ([Acts 5.8](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#008.md)<span
id="vi.xii-p9.9"></span>.) And yet she might have perceived even from
this that Peter knew the secret. For why, having questioned none other,
does he question you? Was it not clear that he asked because he knew?
But so great was her hardness, it would not let her attempt to evade the
guilt; and with great confidence she replied; for she thought she was
speaking only to a man. The aggravation of the sin was, that they
committed it as with one soul, just as upon a settled compact between
them. “How is it that ye have agreed together,” he said, “to tempt the
Spirit of the Lord? behold, the feet of them which have buried thy
husband are at the door.” ([Acts
5.9](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#009)<span id="vi.xii-p9.10"></span>..md)
First he makes her learn the sin, and then shows that she will justly
suffer the same punishment with her husband, since she has committed the
same wickedness: “And they shall carry thee out. And she fell down
straightway at his feet,” for she was standing near him, “and yielded up
the ghost.” ([Acts 5.10](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#010.md)<span
id="vi.xii-p9.11"></span>.) So entirely by their own act had they
invited upon themselves the vengeance! Who after that would not be
struck with awe? who would not fear the Apostle? who would not marvel?
who not be afraid? “And they were with one accord, all of them in
Solomon’s porch,” ([Acts 5.12](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#012.md)<span
id="vi.xii-p9.12"></span>) no longer in a house, but having occupied the
very Temple, they there passed their time! No longer they guarded
themselves against touching the unclean; nay, without scruple they
handled the dead. And observe how, while to their own people they are
severe, against the aliens they do not exercise their power. “But <span
id="fr_292"></span>[293](#fn_292.md) the people,” he says, “magnified
them.” ([Acts 5.13](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#013.md)<span
id="vi.xii-p10.4"></span>.) And as he had mentioned their being “in
Solomon’s porch,” that you may not wonder how the multitude allowed
this, he tells us that they did not dare even to approach them: for “no
man,” he says, “durst join himself unto them.” “But believers were the
more added unto the Lord, multitudes both of men and women: insomuch
that they brought forth the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds
and couches, that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by might
overshadow some of them.” ([Acts 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#014.md),
[15](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#015)<span id="vi.xii-p10.5"></span>..md)
Great faith, surpassing what had been shown in the case of Christ. How
comes this? Because Christ declared: “And greater works than these shall
he do, because I go unto My Father.” ([John xiv.
12](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#012)<span id="vi.xii-p10.6"></span>..md)
And these things the people do, while the Apostles remain there, and are
not moving about from place to place: also from other places they were
all bringing \[their sick\] on beds and couches: and from all quarters
accrued to them fresh tribute of wonder; from them that believed, from
them that were healed, from him that was punished; from their boldness
of speech towards those (their adversaries), from the virtuous behavior
of the believers: for certainly the effect produced was not owing to the
miracles only. For though the Apostles themselves modestly ascribe it
all to this cause, declaring that they did these things in the name of
Christ, yet at the same time the life and noble conduct of the men
helped to produce this effect. “And believers were more added unto the
Lord, multitudes both of men and women.” Observe, how he now no longer
tells the number of them that believe; at such a rate was the faith
making way even to an immense multitude, and so widely was the
Resurrection proclaimed. So then “the people magnified them:” but they
were now no longer lightly to be despised as once they were: for in a
little moment, at a single turn of the scale, such have been the effects
produced by the fisherman and by the publican! Earth was become a
heaven, for manner of life, for boldness of speech, for wonders, for all
besides; like Angels were they looked upon with wonder: all unconcerued
for ridicule, for threats, for perils: compassionate <span
id="fr_293"></span>[294](#fn_293.md) were they, and beneficent; some of
them they succoured with money, and some with words, and some with
healing of their bodies and of their souls; no kind of healing (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xii-p11.1"></span>πἅν εἶδος ἰατρείας</span>)
but they accomplished.

<span id="vi.xii-p12"></span>Peter all but pleads for himself, when at
the point to inflict the punishment, and at the same time gives a lesson
to the rest. For because the act would seem exceeding stern, therefore
it is that he does so much <span id="fr_294"></span>[295](#fn_294.md) in
the case. <span id="fr_295"></span>[296](#fn_295.md) In respect of the
woman also the process of judgment was terrible. But <span
id="fr_296"></span>[297](#fn_296.md) see how many evils grow out of the
sacrilege: covetousness, contempt of God, impiety; and upon these too he
pleaded for himself before the assembly, in that he did not immediately
proceed to punishment, but first exposed the sin. None groaned, none
lamented, all were terrified. For as their faith increased, the signs
also were multiplied, and great was the fear among their own company:
for the things which are from without do not so militate (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xii-p15.1"></span>πολεμεἵ</span>) against our
peace, as do the acts of our own people. If we be firmly joined
together, no <span id="fr_297"></span>[298](#fn_297.md) warfare will be
hard: but the mischief would be the being divided and broken up. Now
they went about in the public place: with boldness they attacked even
the market, and in the midst of enemies they prevailed, and that saying
was fulfilled, “Be Thou Ruler in the midst among Thine enemies.” (<span
id="vi.xii-p16.1"></span>[Ps. cx.
2](../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#002)<span id="vi.xii-p16.2"></span>..md)
This was a greater miracle, that they, arrested, cast into prison,
should do such acts as these!

<span id="vi.xii-p17"></span>If those for lying suffered such things,
what shall not the perjured suffer? Because she simply affirmed, “Yea,
for so much,” ye see what she suffered. Bethink you then; they that
swear and forswear themselves, of what should they be worthy? It <span
id="fr_298"></span>[299](#fn_298.md) comes in opportunely to-day even from
the Old Testament to show you the heinousness of perjury. “There was,”
it says, “a flying sickle, ten cubits in breadth.” ([Zech. v.
2](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#002)<span id="vi.xii-p18.16"></span>..md)
The “flying” betokens the swift advent of the vengeance which pursues
oaths; that it is many cubits in length and breadth, signifies the force
and magnitude of the woes; that it comes flying “from heaven,” is to
show that the vengeance comes from the judgment-seat on high: that it is
in the form of a sickle,” denotes the inevitableness of the doom: for
just as the sickle, where it comes and has hooked the neck, is not drawn
back with nothing but itself, but with the head reaped off, even so the
vengeance which comes upon the swearers is severe, and will not desist
until it have completed its work. But if we swear and escape, let us not
be confident; this is but to our woe. For what think ye? How many, since
Ananias and Sapphira, have dared the same with them? How is it then, say
you, that they have not met with the same fate? Not because it was
allowed in them, but because they are reserved for a greater punishment.
For those who often sin and are not punished, have greater reason to
fear and dread than if they were punished. For the vengeance is
increased for them by their present impunity and the long-suffering of
God. Then let us not look to this, that we are not punished; but let us
consider whether we have not sinned: if sinning we are not punished, we
have the more reason to tremble. Say, if you have a slave, and you only
threaten him, and do not beat him; when is he most in fear, when most
inclined to run away? Is is not when you only threaten him? And hence we
advise each other not to be continually using threats, thereby choosing
rather to agitate the mind by the terror, and lacerating it worse than
with blows. For in the one instance the punishment is momentary, but in
the other it is perpetual. If then no one feels the stroke of the
sickle, do not look to this, but rather let each consider whether he
commits such sins. Many like things are done now as were done before the
Flood, yet no flood has been sent: because there is a hell threatened,
and vengeance. Many sin as the people did in Sodom, yet no rain of fire
has been poured down; because a river of fire is prepared. Many go the
lengths of Pharaoh; yet they have not fared like Pharaoh, they have not
been drowned in a Red Sea: for the sea that awaits them, is the sea of
the bottomless pit, where the punishment is not accompanied with
insensibility, where there is no suffocation to end all, but in ever
lengthened torture, in burning, in strangling, they are consumed there.
Many have offended like the Israelites, but no serpents have devoured
them: there awaits them the worm that never dieth. Many have been like
Gehazi, yet they have not been struck with leprosy: for instead of
leprosy, it remains for them to be cut asunder, and numbered among the
hypocrites. Many have both sworn and forsworn; but if they have indeed
escaped, let us not be confident: the gnashing of teeth awaits them.
Yea, here too they will suffer many grievous woes, though, it may be,
not immediately, but after further transgressions, that the vengeance
may be the greater; for even we often set out at first with small sins,
and then through great offences lose all. Therefore when you see
anything happening to you, call to mind that particular sin of yours.
The sons of Jacob are an example of this. Remember Joseph’s brothers;
they had sold their brother, they had even attempted to slay him; nay,
they had slain him, as far as inclination went; they had deceived and
grieved the old man; they suffered nothing. After many years they are
brought into extreme peril, and now they are put in remembrance of this
their sin. Exceeding wisely is this circumstance brought in. Hear what
they say: “We are verily guilty concerning our brother.” ([Gen. xlii.
21](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#021)<span id="vi.xii-p18.17"></span>..md)
In this manner then do thou also, when anything happens, say, We are
verily guilty, because we have not obeyed Christ; because we have sworn;
my much swearing, and my false swearing, has fallen upon my own head.
Confess thou; since they also confessed, and were saved. For what though
the punishment follow not immediately? Since Ahab also did not
immediately after his sin in the matter of Naboth suffer that vengeance
which he yet at last suffered. (<span id="vi.xii-p18.18"></span>[1 Kings
xxi. 19](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#019.md)<span
id="vi.xii-p18.19"></span>.) And what is the reason of this? God sets
thee a time, in which to wash thyself clean; but if thou persist, at
last He will send down the vengeance. You have seen the fate of liars.
Consider what is the fate of false swearers, consider, and desist. It is
impossible a swearer should not forswear himself, whether he will or
not; and no perjurer can be saved. One false oath sufficeth to finish
all, to draw down upon us the whole measure of vengeance. Let us then
take heed to ourselves, that we may escape the punishment due to this
offence, and be deemed worthy of the loving kindness of God, through the
grace and mercies of His only-begotten Son, with Whom to the Father and
the Holy Ghost be glory, power, and honor, now and ever, and world
without end. Amen.

<span id="vi.xii-p4"></span> Chrys. evidently regards the death of
Ananias and Sapphira as a miracle wrought by Peter (so Meyer). All that
the narrative states is that Peter disclosed the sin of Ananias and
foretold the fate of his wife (Lechler). The middle position seems
preferable: Peter acted as the instrument of God, the agent of the
divine retribution. His will acted in conscious harmony with the divine
purpose of which it was the organ (so Gloag).—G.B.S.

<span id="vi.xii-p11"></span> Edd. from E. “But not only for this
reason, but because, being exceedingly humane and beneficent, they
succored some with money, some with healing of their bodies. Why hath
Satan filled thine heart? Peter,” etc.

<span id="vi.xii-p13"></span> E. Edd. “therefore both in the case of the
man himself, and in that of the wife, he makes the judgment terrible.”

id="vi.xii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xii-p14"></span> Our author touches upon the difficulty
which has so often been found in this narrative on account of the
apparent disproportion of the penalty to the offence. But it is to be
remembered that: (1) The narrative presents the sin as the most
heinous—lying to God—trying to deceive the Holy Spirit whose organs the
Apostles were. It was a deliberate conspiracy for this purpose. (2)
These persons were members of the church who professed to possess and
should have possessed the Holy Spirit. Instead they had been overcome by
a Satanic principle which here makes its manifestation in pride and
hypocrisy. The selfishness of the deed is the more grievous because of
the great piety and sacrifice of the act which was counterfeited. Pride
is the greater evil, the higher the virtue which it simulates. (3) Such
a retributive miracle, besides being just in itself, may have been
specially necessary in this early stage of the church’s life to warn
against deception and fraud and to emphasize the principles of honor in
the early church. “So terrible was this judgment in order to guard the
first operations of the Holy Spirit” (Neander).—G.B.S.

<span id="vi.xii-p15"></span> Edd. from E. “Now if, their sin being
inexcusable, he had not inflicted such punishment on them both, what
contempt of God would thence have arisen! And that this was the reason,
is evident from the fact, that he did not immediately,” etc.

<span id="fn_297"></span>[i:298](1110017.htm#fr_297.md) <span
id="vi.xii-p15.2"></span>

<span id="vi.xii-p16"></span> E. Edd. “There will be none to war upon
us: just as, if we be put asunder one from another, on the contrary all
will set upon us. Hence it was that they henceforth were of good
courage, and with boldness attacked,” etc.

<span id="fn_298"></span>[i:299](1110017.htm#fr_298.md) <span

<span id="vi.xii-p18"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xii-p18.1"></span>Εὔκαιρον καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς Παλαιᾶς δεῖξαι τὸ χαλεπὸν
τῆς ἐπιορκίας τήμερον</span>. Meaning perhaps that this had occurred in
one of the Scripture Lessons for the day. Below, <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xii-p18.2"></span>Καθάπερ γὰρ δρέπανον
ὅπουπερ ἂν ἐμπεσῃ οὐκ ἂν καθ᾽ ἑαυτὸ ἀνελκυσθείη μόνον, ἀλλὰ καὶ
ἀποτεμνομένης τῆς κεφαλῆς</span>. So A. B. N. Savil. and C., which last
however has <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xii-p18.3"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xii-p18.4"></span>πὸ</span> for <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xii-p18.5"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xii-p18.6"></span>ποτεμνομένης</span>. Hales ap. Sav. suggests,
that <span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xii-p18.7"></span>ἀ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xii-p18.8"></span>ποτεμν. τῆς κεφ</span>.
ought to be rejected: it is better however to supply <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xii-p18.9"></span>εἰς τράχηλον</span> before
<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xii-p18.10"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xii-p18.11"></span>μπέσῃ</span> as in the
translation. The meaning is explained in *Serm. ad. Pop. Antioch.* xv.
t. ii. 158. D. “A flying sword, one might manage to escape from, <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xii-p18.12"></span>δρεπάνην δὲ εἰς τὸν
τράχηλον ἐμπεσοῦσαν καὶ ἀντὶ σχοινίου γενομένην, οὐδεὶς ἂν
διαφύγοι</span>, but from a sickle darted round the neck and catching it
as a halter would, there can be no escape.” Hence it appears that the
innovator has quite mistaken the Author’s meaning. He reads, <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xii-p18.13"></span>Καθάπερ γὰρ δρέπανον εἰς
τράχηλον ἐμπεσὸν οὐκ ἂν καθ᾽ ἑαυτὸ ἀνελκυσθείη, μένει δὲ πῶς ἔτι καὶ
ἀποτεμνομένης τῆς κεφαλῆς</span>: i.e. “having cut off one head, it
still remains, that it may cut off more:” which is irrelevant to the
matter in hand, viz. how <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xii-p18.14"></span>τὸ δρέπανοειδὲς</span> denotes <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xii-p18.15"></span>τὸ ἄφυκτον τῆς
τιμωρίας</span>. Of the Edd. Savile alone retains the old and genuine
reading. Montf. strangely remarks, *“Savilianam lectionem esse
Morelliana quam sequimur obscuriorem.”*
