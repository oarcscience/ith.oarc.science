<span id="vi.l-p1"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vi.l-p1.1"></span>Homily L.</span>

<span id="vi.l-p2"></span>[Acts 23:31](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#031.md),
[32](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#032.md),
[33](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#033.md)<span id="vi.l-p2.1"></span>

<span id="vi.l-p3"></span>“Then the soldiers, as it was commanded them,
took Paul, and brought him by night to Antipatris. On the morrow they
left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the castle: who, when
they came to Cæsarea, and delivered the epistle to the governor,
presented Paul also before him.”

<span id="vi.l-p4"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="vi.l-p4.1"></span>Like</span> some king whom his body-guards escort,
so did these convey Paul; in such numbers too, and by night, for fear of
the wrath of the people. <span id="fr_1106"></span>[1107](#fn_1106.md) Now
then you will say that they have got him out of the city, they desist
from their violence? No indeed. But (the tribune) would not have sent
him off with such care for his safety, but that while he himself had
found nothing amiss in him, he knew the murderous disposition of his
adversaries. “And when the governor had read the letter, he asked of
what province he was. And when he understood that he was of Cilicia; I
will hear thee, said he, when thine accusers are also come.” Already
Lysias has spoken for his exculpation; (but the Jews seek to) gain the
hearer beforehand. “And he ordered him to be kept in custody in Herod’s
prætorium” ([Acts 23:34](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#034.md),
[35](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#035)<span id="vi.l-p5.7"></span>.md):
again Paul is put in bonds. “And after five days came down the high
priest Ananias with the elders.” See how for all this they do not
desist; hindered as they were by obstacles without number, nevertheless
they come, only to be put to shame here also. “And with an orator, one
Tertullus.” <span id="fr_1107"></span>[1108](#fn_1107.md) And what need was
there of “an orator? Which (persons) also informed the governor against
Paul.” ([Acts 24.1](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#001.md)<span
id="vi.l-p6.4"></span>.) See how this man also from the very outset
(*b*) with his praises seeks to gain the judge beforehand. “And when he
was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, Seeing that by
thee we enjoy great quietness, and that very worthy deeds are done unto
this nation by thy providence, we accept it always, and in all places,
most noble Felix, with all thankfulness.” ([Acts
24:2](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#002.md),
[3](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#003)<span id="vi.l-p6.5"></span>..md) Then
as having much to say, he passes by the rest: “Notwithstanding, that I
be not further tedious unto thee, I pray thee that thou wouldest hear us
of thy clemency a few words. For we have found this man a pestilent
fellow, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the
world.” (*a*) As a revolutionary and seditious person he wishes to
deliver him up. And yet, it might be answered, it is ye that have done
this. (*c*) And see how he would put up the judge to a desire of
punishing, seeing he had here an opportunity to coerce the man that
turned the world upside down! As if they had achieved a meritorious
action, they make much of it: “Having found this fellow,” etc., “a mover
of sedition,” say they, “among all the Jews throughout the world.” (Had
he been such), they would have proclaimed him as a benefactor and
saviour of the nation! <span id="fr_1108"></span>[1109](#fn_1108.md) “And a
ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes.” ([Acts
24:4](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#004.md),
[5](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#005)<span id="vi.l-p7.4"></span>..md) They
thought this likely to tell as a reproach—“of the Nazarenes:” and by
this also they seek to damage him—for Nazareth was a mean place. And,
“we have found him,” say they: see how maliciously they calumniate him:
(found him), as if he had been always giving them the slip, and with
difficulty they had succeeded in getting him: though he had been seven
days in the Temple! “Who also hath gone about to profane the temple;
whom we took, \[and would have judged according to our law.”\] ([Acts
24.6](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#006)<span id="vi.l-p7.5"></span>..md) See
how they insult even the Law; it was so like the Law, forsooth, to beat,
to kill, to lie in wait! And then the accusation against Lysias: though
he had no right, say they, to interfere, in the excess of his confidence
he snatched him from us: \[“But the tribune Lysias came upon us, and
with great violence took him away out of our hands, commanding his
accusers to come unto thee\]: <span id="fr_1109"></span>[1110](#fn_1109.md)
by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things,
where of we accuse him. And the Jews also assented, saying that these
things were so.” ([Acts 24.7-9](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#007.md)<span
id="vi.l-p8.3"></span>). What then says Paul? “Then Paul; after that the
governor had beckoned unto him to speak, answered, Forasmuch as I know
that thou hast been of many years a just judge unto this nation, I do
the more cheerfully answer for myself.” ([Acts
24.10](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#010)<span id="vi.l-p8.4"></span>..md)
This is not the language of flattery, his testifying to the judge’s
justice: <span id="fr_1110"></span>[1111](#fn_1110.md) no, the adulation
was rather in that speech of the orator, “By thee we enjoy great
quietness.” If so, then why are ye seditious? What Paul sought was
justice. “Knowing thee to be a just judge, I cheerfully,” says he,
“answer for myself.” Then also he enforces this by the length of time:
that (he had been judge) “of many years. Because that thou mayest
understand, that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to
Jerusalem for to worship.” ([Acts
24.11](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#011)<span id="vi.l-p9.4"></span>..md)
And what is this? <span id="fr_1111"></span>[1112](#fn_1111) (It means.md),
“that I could not immediately have raised a commotion.” Because the
accuser had nothing to show (as done) in Jerusalem, observe what he
said: “among all the Jews throughout the world.” Therefore it is that
Paul here forcibly attracts him—“to worship,” he says, “I came up,” so
far am I from raising sedition—and lays a stress upon this point of
justices being the strong point. “And they neither found me in the
Temple disputing with any man, neither raising up the people, neither in
the synagogues, nor in the city” ([Acts
24.12](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#012)<span id="vi.l-p10.8"></span>.md);
which in fact was the truth. And the accusers indeed use the term
“ringleader,” as if it were a case of fighting and insurrection; but see
how mildly Paul here answers. “But this I confess unto thee, that after
the way which they call heresy, <span
id="fr_1112"></span>[1113](#fn_1112.md) so worship I the God of my fathers,
believing all things which are written in the Law and the Prophets: and
have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall
be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.” ([Acts
24:14](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#014.md),
[15](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#015)<span id="vi.l-p11.5"></span>..md) The
accusers were separating him (as an alien), but he identifies himself
with the Law, as one of themselves. “And in this,” says he, “do I
exercise myself, to have always a conscience void of offence toward God
and toward men. Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation,
and offerings. In which they found me purified in the temple, not with
multitude, neither with tumult.” ([Acts
24:16](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#016.md),
[17](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#017.md),
[18](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#018)<span id="vi.l-p11.6"></span>..md) Why
then camest thou up? What brought thee hither? To worship, says he; to
do alms. This was not the act of a factious person. Then also he casts
out their person: <span id="fr_1113"></span>[1114](#fn_1113.md) “but,” says
he, (they that found me, were) “certain Jews from Asia, who ought to
have been here before thee, and object, if they had ought against me. Or
else let these same here say, if they have found any evil doing in me
while I stood before the council, except it be for this one voice, that
I cried, standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am
called in question by you this day.” ([Acts
24:19](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#019.md),
[20](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#020.md),
[21](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#021)<span id="vi.l-p12.8"></span>..md) For
this is justification in superabundance, not to flee from his accusers,
but to be ready to give account to all. <span
id="fr_1114"></span>[1115](#fn_1114.md) “Of the resurrection of the dead,”
says he, “am I this day called in question.” And not a word said he of
what he had to say, how they had conspired against him, had violently
kept him, had laid wait for him—for these matters are course spoken of
by the tribune <span id="fr_1115"></span>[1116](#fn_1115.md) —but by Paul,
though there was danger, not so: no, he is silent, and only defends
himself, though he had very much to say. (*b*) “In which” <span
id="fr_1116"></span>[1117](#fn_1116) (alms.md), says he, “they found me in
course of purifying in the Temple.” Then how did he profane it? For it
was not the part of the same man both to purify himself and worship and
come for this purpose, and then to profane it. This has with it a
surmise of the justice of his cause, that he does not fall into a long
discourse. And he gratifies the judge, I suppose, by that also (namely,
by), making his defence compendious: (*d*) seeing that Tertullus before
him did make a long harangue. (*f*) And this too is a proof of mildness,
that when one has much to say, in order not to be troublesome one says
but few words. (*c*) But let us look again at what has been said.

<span id="vi.l-p16"></span>(Recapitulation.) “Then the soldiers,” etc.
([Acts 23.31-33](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#031.md)<span
id="vi.l-p16.1"></span>.) (*a*) This also made Paul famous in Cæsarea,
his coming with so large a force.—“But,” says Tertullus, “that I be not
further tedious,” (*e*) showing that (Felix) does find him tedious
(<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.l-p16.2"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.l-p16.3"></span>γκόπτεται</span>): “I beseech
thee,” he does not say, Hear the matter, but, “hear us of thy clemency.”
([Acts 24.4](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#004.md)<span
id="vi.l-p16.4"></span>.) Probably it is to pay court, that he thus lays
out his speech. (*g*) “For having found this man, a pestilent fellow,
and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world” ([Acts
24.5](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#005)<span id="vi.l-p16.5"></span>.md):
how then, it might be said, if he did this elsewhere (and not here)? No,
says he; among us also he has profaned the Temple; “attempted,” says he,
“to profane it:” but the how, he leaves untold. “Whom also we took.”
etc. “But the tribune,” etc. And while he thus exaggerates what relates
to the tribune, <span id="fr_1117"></span>[1118](#fn_1117.md) see how he
extenuates the part of the accusers themselves. “We took him,” he says,
“and would have judged him according to our Law.” ([Acts
24.6](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#006)<span id="vi.l-p17.2"></span>..md) He
shows that it is a hardship to them that they have to come to foreign
tribunals, and that they would not have troubled him had not the tribune
compelled them, and that he, having no concern in the matter, had seized
the man by force: for in fact the wrongs done were against us, and with
us the tribunal ought to have been. For that this is the meaning, see
what follows: “with great violence” ([Acts
24.7](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#007)<span id="vi.l-p17.3"></span>.md), he
says. For this conduct is violence. “From whom thou mayest know.” He
neither dares to accuse him (the tribune)—for the man was indulgent
(forsooth)—nor does he wholly pass it by. Then again, lest he should
seem to be lying, he adduces Paul himself as his own accuser. “From
whom, by examining him, thou mayest take knowledge of all these things.”
([Acts 24.8](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#008.md)<span
id="vi.l-p17.4"></span>.) Next, as witnesses also of the things spoken,
the accusers, the same persons themselves both witnesses and accusers:
“And the Jews also assented,” etc. ([Acts
24.9](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#009)<span id="vi.l-p17.5"></span>..md)
But Paul, “Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a just
judge.” ([Acts 24.10](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#010.md)<span
id="vi.l-p17.6"></span>.) Why then, he is no stranger or alien or
revolutionary person, seeing he had known the judge for many years. And
he does well to add the epithet “just,” <span
id="fr_1118"></span>[1119](#fn_1118) that he (Felix.md) might not look to
the chief priest, nor to the people, nor the accuser. See, how he did
not let himself be carried away into abuse, although there was strong
provocation. “Believing,” he says, “that there will be a resurrection:”
now a man who believed a resurrection, would never have done such
things—“which” (resurrection) “they themselves also allow.” ([Acts
24.15](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#015)<span id="vi.l-p18.2"></span>..md)
He does not say it of them, that they believe “all things written in the
Prophets:” it was he that believed them all, not they: but how “all,” it
would require a long discourse to show. And he nowhere makes mention of
Christ. Here by saying, “Believing,” he does (virtually) introduce what
relates to Christ; for the present he dwells on the subject of the
resurrection, which doctrine was common to them also, and removed the
suspicion of any sedition. And for the cause of his going up, “I came,”
he says, “to bring alms to my nation and offerings.” ([Acts
24.17](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#017)<span id="vi.l-p18.3"></span>..md)
How then should I have troubled those, for the bringing offerings to
whom I had come so long a journey? “Neither with multitude, nor with
tumult.” ([Acts 24.18](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#018.md)<span
id="vi.l-p18.4"></span>.) Everywhere he does away the charge of
sedition. And he also does well to challenge his accusers who were from
Asia, “Who ought to accuse before thee,” etc., but he does well also not
to reject this either; <span id="fr_1119"></span>[1120](#fn_1119.md) “or
else,” says he, “let these same here say. Touching the resurrection of
the dead,” etc. ([Acts 24:19](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#019.md),
[20](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#020.md),
[21](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#021)<span id="vi.l-p19.5"></span>.md): for
in fact it was on this account they were sore troubled from the first,
because he preached the Resurrection. This being proved, the things
relating to Christ also were easily introduced, that He was risen. “What
evil doing,” he says, “they found in me. In the council” ([Acts
4.2](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#002)<span id="vi.l-p19.6"></span>.md) he
says: the examination not having taken place in private. That these
things which I say are true, those witness who bring this charge against
me. “Having,” he says, “a conscience void of offence both toward God,
and toward men.” ([Acts 24.16](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#016.md)<span
id="vi.l-p19.7"></span>.) This is the perfection of virtue, when even to
men we give no handle against us, and are careful to be void of offence
with God. “That I cried,” he says, “in the council.” He also shows their
violence. <span id="fr_1120"></span>[1121](#fn_1120.md) They have it not to
say, Thou didst these things under the pretext of alms: for (it was)
“not with multitude, nor with tumult:” especially as upon enquiry made
concerning this thing, nothing further was found. Do you observe his
moderation, though there were dangers? do you observe how he keeps his
tongue from evil-speaking, how he seeks only one thing, to free himself
from the charges against himself, not that he may criminate them, except
so far as he might be obliged to do so while defending himself? Just as
Christ also said: “I have not a devil, but I honor My Father: but ye do
dishonor Me.” (<span id="vi.l-p20.3"></span>[John viii.
49](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#049)<span id="vi.l-p20.4"></span>..md)

<span id="vi.l-p21"></span>Let us imitate him, since he also was an
imitator of Christ. If he, with enemies, who went even to the length of
murder and slaughter, said nothing offensive to them, what pardon shall
we deserve, who in reviling and abuse become infuriated, calling our
enemies villains, detestable wretches? what pardon shall we deserve, for
having enemies at all? Hear you not, that to honor (another) is to honor
one’s self? So it is: but we disgrace ourselves. You accuse (some one)
that he has abused you: then why do you bring yourself under the same
accusation? Why inflict a blow on yourself? Keep free from passion, keep
unwounded: do not, by wishing to smite another, bring the hurt upon
yourself. What, is the other tumult of our soul not enough for us, the
tumult that is stirred up, though there be none to stir it up—for
example, its outrageous lusts, its griefs and sorrows, and such like—but
we must needs heap up a pile of others also? And how, you will say, is
it possible, when one is insulted and abused, to bear this? And how is
it not possible, I ask? Is a wound got from words; or do words inflict
bruises on our bodies? Then where is the hurt to us? So that, if we
will, we can bear it. Let us lay down for ourselves a law not to grieve,
and we shall bear it: let us say to ourselves, “It is not from enmity;
it is from infirmity”—for it is indeed owing to an infirmity, since, for
proof that it comes not from enmity nor from malignity of disposition,
but from infirmity, the other also would fain have restrained (his
anger), although he had suffered numberless wrongs. If we only have this
thought in our minds, that it is from infirmity, we shall bear it, and
while we forgive the offending person, we shall try not to fall into it
ourselves. For I ask all you who are present: would ye have wished to be
able to exercise such a philosophic temper, as to bear with those who
insult you? <span id="fr_1121"></span>[1122](#fn_1121.md) I think so. Well,
then, he insulted unwillingly; he would rather not have done so, but he
did it, forced by his passion: refrain thyself. Do you not see (how it
is with) the demoniacs (in their fits)? Just then as it is with them, so
with him: it is not so much from enmity, as from infirmity (that he
behaves as he does): endure it. And as for us—it is not so much from the
insults as they are in themselves that we are moved, as from our own
selves: else how is it that when madmen offer us the same insults, we
bear it? Again, if those who insult us be our friends, in that case too
we bear it: or also our superiors, in that case also we bear it: how
then is it not absurd, that in the case of these three, friends, madmen,
and superiors, we bear it, but where they are of the same rank or our
inferiors, we do not bear it? I have oftentimes said: It is but an
impulse of the moment, something that hurries us away on the sudden: let
us endure it for a little, and we shall bear the whole thing. The
greater the insults, the more weak the offender. Do you know when it
behooves us to grieve? When we have insulted another, and he keeps
silence: for then he is strong, and we weak: but if the contrary be the
case, you must even rejoice: you are crowned, you are proclaimed
conqueror, without having even entered into the contest, without having
borne the annoyance of sun, and heat, and dust, without having grappled
with an antagonist and let him close with you; nothing but a mere wish
on your part, sitting or standing, and you have got a mighty crown: a
crown far greater than those (combatants earn): for to throw an enemy
standing to the encounter, is nothing like so great as to overcome the
darts of anger. You have conquered, without having even let him close
with you, you have thrown down the passion that was in you, have slain
the beast that was roused, have quelled the anger that was raging, like
some excellent herdsman. The fight was like to have been an intestine
one, the war a civil war. For, as those who sit down to besiege from
without (endeavor to), embroil (the besieged) in civil discords, and
then overcome them; so he that insults, unless he rouse the passion
within us, will not be able to overcome us: unless we kindle the flame
in ourselves, he has no power. Let the spark of anger be within us, so
as to be ready for lighting at the right moment, not against ourselves,
nor so as to involve us in numberless evils. See ye not how the fire in
houses is kept apart, and not thrown about at random everywhere, neither
among straw, nor among the linen, nor just where it may chance, that so
there may not be danger, if a wind blow on it, of its kindling a flame:
but whether a maid-servant have a lamp, or the cook light a fire, there
is many an injunction given, not to do this in the draught of the wind,
nor near a wooden panel, nor in the night-time: but when the night has
come on, we extinguish the fire, fearing lest perchance while we are
asleep and there is none to help, it set fire, and burn us all. Let this
also be done with regard to anger; let it not be scattered everywhere up
and down in our thoughts, but let it be in some deep recess of the mind,
that the wind arising from the words of him who is opposing us may not
easily reach to it, but that it receive the wind (which is to rouse it)
from ourselves, who know how to rouse it in due measure and with safety.
If it receive the wind from without, it knows no moderation; it will set
everything on fire: oftentimes when we are asleep this wind will come
upon it, and will burn up all. Let it therefore be with us (in safe
keeping) in such sort as only to kindle a light: for anger does kindle a
light when it is managed as it ought to be: and let us have torches
against those who wrong others, against the devil. Let not the spark lie
anywhere as it may chance, nor be thrown about; let us keep it safe
under ashes: in lowly thoughts let us keep it slumbering. We do not want
it at all times, but when there is need to subdue and to make tender, to
mollify obduracy, and convict the soul. What evils have angry and
wrathful passions wrought! And what makes it grievous indeed is, that
when we have parted asunder, we have no longer the power to come
together again, but we wait for others (to do this): each is ashamed,
and blushes to come back himself and reconcile the other. See, he is not
ashamed to part asunder and to be separated; no, he takes the lead as
author of the evil: but to come forward and patch that which is rent,
this he is ashamed to do: and the case is just the same, as if a man
should not shrink from cutting off a limb, but should be ashamed to join
it together again. What sayest thou, O man? Hast thou committed great
injuries, and thyself been the cause of the quarrel? Why, then, thou
wouldest justly be the first to go and be reconciled, as having thyself
furnished the cause. But he did the wrong, he is the cause of the
enmity? Why then, for this reason also thou must do it, that men may the
more admire thee, that in addition to the former, thou mayest get the
first prize in the latter also: as thou wast not the cause of the
enmity, so neither of its being extended further. Perhaps also the
other, as conscious within himself of numberless evils, is ashamed and
blushes. But he is haughty? On this account above all, do not thou
hesitate to run and meet him: for if the ailment in him be twofold, both
haughtiness and anger, in this thou hast mentioned the very reason why
thou oughtest to be the first to go to him, thou that art the one in
sound health, the one who is able to see: as for him, he is in darkness:
for such is anger and false pride. But do thou, who art free from these
and in sound health, go to him—thou the physician, go to the sick. Does
any of the physicians say, Because such an one is sick, I do not go to
him? No, this is the very reason above all why they do go, when they see
that he is not able to come to them. For of those who are able (to come)
they think less, as of persons not extremely ill, but not so of those
who lie at home sick. Or are not pride and anger, think you, worse than
any illness? is not the one like a sharp fever, the other like a body
swollen with inflammation? Think what a thing it is to have a fever and
inflammation: go to him, extinguish the fire, for by the grace of God
thou canst: go, assuage the heat as it were with water. “But,” you will
say, “how if he is only the more set up by my doing this very thing?”
This is nothing to thee: thou hast done thy part, let him take account
for himself: let not our conscience condemn us, that this thing happens
in consequence of any omission of what ought to have been done on our
part. “In so doing,” says the Scripture, “thou shalt heap coals of fire
on his head.” ([Rom. xii. 20](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#020.md)<span
id="vi.l-p22.26"></span>, cf. Hom. in l. xxii. §3.) And yet, for all
that this is the consequence, it bids us go and be reconciled and do
good offices—not that we may heap coals of fire, but that (our enemy)
knowing that future consequence, <span
id="fr_1122"></span>[1123](#fn_1122.md) may be assuaged by the present
kindness, that he may tremble, that he may fear our good offices rather
than our hostilities, and our friendships rather than our ill designs.
For one does not so hurt his hater by showing his resentment as an
enemy, as by doing him good and showing kindness. For by his resentment,
he has hurt both himself and perhaps the other also in some little
degree: but by doing good offices, he has heaped coals of fire on his
head. “Why then,” you will say, “for fear of thus heaping coals one
ought not to do this (*b*) but to carry on the enmity to greater
lengths.” By no means: it is not you that cause this, but he with his
brutish disposition. For if, when you are doing him good, and honoring
him, and offering to be reconciled, he persists in keeping up the
enmity, it is he has kindled the fire for himself, he has set his own
head on fire; you are guiltless. Do not want to be more merciful than
God (*b*), or rather, if you wish it, you will not be able, not even in
the least degree. How should you? “As far as the heaven is from the
earth,” Scripture says, “so far are My counsels from your counsels”
([Isa. xlv. 8](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#008.md)<span
id="vi.l-p23.11"></span>): and again, “If ye,” He says, “being evil,
know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more your
heavenly Father” ([Matt. vii. 11](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#011.md)<span
id="vi.l-p23.12"></span>)? But in fact this talk is mere pretext and
subterfuge. Let us not prevaricate with God’s commandments. “And how do
we prevaricate,” you will say? He has said, “In so doing, thou wilt heap
coals of fire on his head:” and you say, I do not like to do this. (*a*)
But are you willing to heap coals after another fashion, that is upon
your own head? For in fact this is what resentment does: (*c*) since you
shall suffer evils without number. (*e*) You say, “I am afraid for my
enemy, because he has done me great injuries:” in reality is it this you
say? But how came you to have an enemy? But how came you to hate your
enemy? You fear for him that has injured you, but do you not fear
yourself? Would that you had a care for yourself! Do not act (the
kindness) with such an aim as this: or rather do it, though it be but
with such an aim. But you do it not at all. I say not to you, “thou wilt
heap coals of fire:” no, I say another and a greater thing: only do it.
For Paul says this only by way of summoning thee (if only), in hope of
the vengeance, to put an end to the enmity. Because we are savage as
wild beasts in disposition, and would not otherwise endure to love our
enemy, unless we expected some revenge, he offers this as a cake, so to
say, to a wild beast. For to the Apostles (the Lord) says not this, but
what says He? “That ye may be like to your Father which is in heaven.”
([Matt. v. 45](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#045.md)<span
id="vi.l-p23.13"></span>.) And besides, it is not possible that the
benefactor and the benefited should remain in enmity. This is why Paul
has put it in this way. Why, affecting a high and generous principle in
thy words, why in thy deeds dost thou not even observe (common)
moderation? (It sounds) well; thou dost not feed him, for fear of
thereby heaping upon him coals of fire: well then, thou sparest him?
well then, thou lovest him, thou actest with this object in view? God
knows, whether thou hast this object in so speaking, and are not <span
id="fr_1123"></span>[1124](#fn_1123.md) palming this talk upon us as a mere
pretence and subterfuge. Thou hast a care for thine enemy, thou fearest
lest he be punished, then wouldest thou not have extinguished thine
anger? For he that loves to that degree that he overlooks his own
interest for the sake of the other’s advantage, that man has no enemy.
(Then indeed) thou mightest say this. How long shall we trifle in
matters that are not to be trifled with, and that admit of no excuse?
Wherefore I beseech you, let us cut off these pretexts; let us not
despise God’s laws: that we may be enabled with well-pleasing to the
Lord to pass this life present, and attain unto the good things
promised, through the grace and mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ, with
Whom to the Father and the Holy Ghost together be glory, might, honor,
now and ever, world without end. Amen.

but this is very unsatisfactory. To make sense, it must be read
interrogatively: “Well then, at any rate that now, they have got him out
of the city, they desist from further attempts? By no means; and in fact
the precautions taken for his safety show what was the tribune’s view of
the matter, both that Paul was innocent and that *they* were set on

<span id="vi.l-p6"></span> It has been necessary to rearrange the texts,
and also to transpose the parts mark *a, b.*—<span class="Greek"><span

<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.l-p6.2"></span>φησί</span> here is
hypothetical: “Tertullus wishes to arraign Paul as a seditious person.
And yet, Felix might say, it is ye Jews that have been the movers of
sedition: in these words ye describe yourselves.”—Mod. text “[Acts
24.2-4](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#002.md)<span id="vi.l-p6.3"></span>.
And yet ye have done this: then what need of an orator? See how this
man, also from the very outset wishes to deliver him up as a
revolutionary and seditious person, and with his praises preoccupies the
judge. Then as having much to say, he passes it by, and only says this,
But that I be not further tedious unto thee.”

<span id="fn_1108"></span>[i:1109](1110055.htm#fr_1108.md) <span

<span id="vi.l-p7"></span> So much was sedition to their taste, they

class="Greek"><span id="vi.l-p9.2"></span>ντα σε κριτὴν δίκαιον</span>
in [Acts 24.10](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#010.md)<span

<span id="vi.l-p10"></span> As Felix had been many years a judge, he was
conversant enough with the habits of the Jews to be aware that the
Pentecost which brought Paul to Jerusalem was but twelve days past: so
that there had not been time to raise a commotion. Mod. text, “And what
did this contribute to the proof? A great point: for he shows that Felix
himself knew that Paul had done nothing of all that he was accused of.
But if he had ever raised an insurrection, Felix would have known it,
being judge, and such an affair would not have scaped his
notice.”—Below, <span class="Greek"><span id="vi.l-p10.1"></span>διὰ
τοῦτο ἐνταῦθα αὐτὸν ἕλκει</span>, we suppose <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.l-p10.2"></span>αὐτὸν</span> to be Felix: Mod. text substitutes
<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.l-p10.3"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.l-p10.4"></span>ντεῦθεν ἀφέλκων</span>,
referring it to the accuser. The meaning is obscure, but it seems to be,
“draws the attention of his judge to this point,” viz., of his having
come up to worship, and therefore <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.l-p10.5"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.l-p10.6"></span>νδιατρίβει τούτῳ τῷ δικαί& 251·</span> lays the
stress upon this point, of Felix being a *just* judge. Perhaps, however,
the true reading here is <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.l-p10.7"></span>τῷ δεκαδύο</span>, “of its being not more than
twelve days.”

<span id="fn_1112"></span>[i:1113](1110055.htm#fr_1112.md) <span

<span id="vi.l-p11"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.l-p11.1"></span>῞</span><span class="Greek"><span

24.14](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#014.md)<span id="vi.l-p11.3"></span> has
the same meaning as in [Acts 24.5](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#005.md)<span
id="vi.l-p11.4"></span>. The meaning is therefore obscured by rendering
it (as A.V.) in the former verse by “sect” and in the latter by
“heresy.” It is *party* or *sect* in both cases, used as a term of
reproach. Paul’s accusers considered him a member of a sect which they
contemptuously called the Nazarenes. In his defence he takes up their
own word.—G.B.S.

<span id="fn_1113"></span>[i:1114](1110055.htm#fr_1113.md) <span
id="vi.l-p11.7"></span>

<span id="vi.l-p12"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.l-p12.1"></span>Εἰτα καὶ ἐκβάλλει αὐτῶν τὸ πρόσωπον</span>,
rejects their person, repudiates their pretension. They had said, “We
found him:” he answers, “There found me, in a condition as far as
possible from that of a mover of sedition—not they, ‘but certain of the
Jews from Asia.’ In the Recapitulation, he says, <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.l-p12.2"></span>καλῶς δὲ οὐδὲ τοῦτο
ἐκβάλλει</span> referring to [Acts
24.21](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#021.md)<span id="vi.l-p12.3"></span>.
Hence one might conjecture here, <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.l-p12.4"></span>εἶτα οὐκ ἐκβ</span>., to be placed after [Acts
24.20](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#020.md)<span id="vi.l-p12.5"></span>;

[6](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#006.md)<span id="vi.l-p13.1"></span> had
contained the three charges preferred by Tertullus, viz.: sedition,
sectarianism and profanation of the temple. Paul was charged with
creating disturbances among the Jews ([Acts
24.5](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#005)<span id="vi.l-p13.2"></span>.md). To
this he replies ([Acts 24:11](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#011.md),
[12](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#012)<span id="vi.l-p13.3"></span>.md),
that the charge is not sustained by facts; he worshipped in the temple,
but neither there, nor in the synagogues, nor in the city, did he create
a disturbance or gather a crowd. To the second charge that he is a
ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes ([Acts
24.5](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#005)<span id="vi.l-p13.4"></span>.md),
Paul replies by conceding that he worships the God of his fathers after
a way which they call a sect, but he denies that this fact involves
rejection or contempt of the law or the prophets ([Acts
24.14](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#014)<span id="vi.l-p13.5"></span>.md).
To the third charge that he had attempted to profane the Temple ([Acts
24.6](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#006)<span id="vi.l-p13.6"></span>.md), he
replies by alleging that he had, on the contrary, brought offerings to
the Temple service and that he had there peaceably taken part in the
religious rites of the Nazarites ([Acts
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#017.md),
[18](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#018)<span id="vi.l-p13.7"></span>.md). He
concludes by insisting that his whole offence consists in having stoutly
maintained the doctrine of the resurrection of the dead.—G.B.S.

Redactor has confused the matter, in consequence of his supposing that
at the mention of Tertullus (*d*) Chrys. must have gone into the
Recapitulation. Hence he places (*c*) the formula <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.l-p15.5"></span>ἀ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.l-p15.6"></span>λλ᾽ ἴδωμεν κ. τ. λ</span>.

places this next. The part (*b*) he keeps in its place, viz. before the
Recapitulation: there remained (*a*), and this he prefixes to *b,*

of v. 31.

does well to challenge the parties who found him viz. the Jews from

deprives them of the credit they took to themselves, for it was not that
they found him; and as to his behavior in the temple, he will not admit
their testimony, for they were not present: yet even these he challenges
to testify to that of which they were cognizant.—Mod. text “from Asia,
saying, Who ought to accuse me before thee, if they had aught against
