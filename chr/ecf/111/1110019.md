<span id="vi.xiv"></span> <span id="vi.xiv-p0.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xiv-p1"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vi.xiv-p1.1"></span>Homily XIV.</span>

<span id="vi.xiv-p2"></span>[Acts V.
34](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#034.md)<span id="vi.xiv-p2.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xiv-p3"></span>“Then stood there up one in the council, a
Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in reputation among
all the people, and commanded the men to be put forth a little space.”

<span id="vi.xiv-p4"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="vi.xiv-p4.1"></span>This</span> Gamaliel was Paul’s teacher. And one
may well wonder, how, being so right-minded in his judgment, and withal
learned in the law, he did not yet believe. But it cannot be that he
should have continued in unbelief to the end. <span
id="fr_317"></span>[318](#fn_317.md) Indeed it appears plainly from the
words he here speaks. He “commanded,” it says, “to put the men forth a
little space \[and said unto them.\]” Observe how judiciously he frames
his speech, and how he immediately at the very outset puts them in fear.
And that he may not be suspected of taking their part, he addresses them
as if he and they were of the same opinion, and does not use much
vehemence, but as speaking to men intoxicated through passion, he thus
expresses himself: “Ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what ye
intend to do as touching these men.” ([Acts
5.35](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#035)<span id="vi.xiv-p5.2"></span>..md)
Do not, he would say, go to work rashly and in a hurry. “For before
these days rose up Theudas, boasting himself to be somebody: to whom a
number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and
all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered, and brought to naught.”
([Acts 5.36](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#036.md)<span
id="vi.xiv-p5.3"></span>.) By examples he teaches them prudence; and, by
way of encouragement, mentions last the man who seduced the greatest
number. Now before he gives the examples, he says, “Take heed to
yourselves;” but when he has cited them, then he declares his opinion,
and says, “Refrain from these men.” For, says he, “there rose up Judas
of Galilee in the days of the taxing, and drew away much people after
him: he also perished; and all, even as many as obeyed him, were
dispersed. And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them
alone: for if this council or this work be of men, it will come to
naught. But if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow them.” (al. *it*)
([Acts 5.37-39](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#037.md)<span
id="vi.xiv-p5.4"></span>.) Then <span id="fr_318"></span>[319](#fn_318.md)
what is there, he would say, to hinder you to be overthrown? For, says
he (take heed), “lest haply ye be found even to fight against God.” He
would dissuade them both by the consideration that the thing is
impossible, and because it is not for their good. And he does not say by
whom these people were destroyed, but that there they “were scattered,”
and their confederacy fell away to nothing. For if, says he, it be of
man, what needs any ado on your part? but if it be of God, for all your
ado you will not be able to overcome it. The argument is unanswerable.
“And they were persuaded by him.” ([Acts
5.40](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#040)<span id="vi.xiv-p6.3"></span>..md)
How were they persuaded? So as not to slay them, but merely to scourge.
For, it says, “And when they had called the Apostles, and beaten them,
they commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus, and let
them go.” See after what great works they are scourged! And again their
teaching became more extended: for they taught at home and in the
temple, “And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing
that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for His name. And daily in
the temple, and in every house, they ceased not to teach and preach
Jesus Christ. ([Acts 5:41](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#041.md),
[42](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#042)<span id="vi.xiv-p6.4"></span>..md)
And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied,
there arose a murmuring of the Hellenists against the Hebrews, because
their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.” ([Acts
6.1](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#001)<span id="vi.xiv-p6.5"></span>..md)
Not absolutely in those immediate days; for it is the custom of
Scripture to speak of things next about to happen, as taking place in
immediate succession. But by “Hellenists” I suppose he means those who
spoke Greek \[“against the Hebrews”\]: for <span
id="fr_319"></span>[320](#fn_319.md) they did not use the Greek language.
Behold another trial! observe how from within and from without there are
warrings, from the very first! “Then,” it says, “the twelve called the
multitude of the disciples unto them, and said, It is not reason that we
should leave the word of God, and serve tables.” ([Acts
6.2](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#002)<span id="vi.xiv-p7.5"></span>..md)
Well said: for the needful must give precedence to the more needful. But
see, how straightway they both take thought for these (inferior
matters), and yet do not neglect the preaching. “Because their widows
were overlooked:” for those (the Hebrews) were treated as the persons of
greater consequence (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xiv-p7.6"></span>αἰδεσιμώτεροι</span>). “Wherefore, brethren,
look ye out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost
and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business. But we will give
ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word. And
the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man
full of faith and of the Holy Ghost” ([Acts
6.3-5](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#003)<span id="vi.xiv-p7.7"></span>..md)
so were the others also full of faith; <span
id="fr_320"></span>[321](#fn_320.md) not to have the same things happening
as in the case of Judas, as in the case of Ananias and Sapphira—“and
Philip, and Prochoras, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas
a proselyte of Antioch: whom they set before the Apostles: and when they
had prayed, they laid their hands on them. And the word of God
increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem
greatly; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.”
([Acts 6.5-7](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#005.md)<span
id="vi.xiv-p8.8"></span>.)

<span id="vi.xiv-p9"></span>But <span id="fr_321"></span>[322](#fn_321.md)
let us look over again what has been spoken. “Ye men of Israel take heed
to yourselves.”(Recapitulation, [Acts
5.35](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#035)<span id="vi.xiv-p10.1"></span>..md)
See here, I pray you, how mildly Gamaliel reasons, and how he says but a
few words to them, and does not recount ancient histories, although he
might have done so, but more recent instances, which are most powerful
to produce belief. With this view he throws out a hint himself, saying,
“For before these days” ([Acts
5.36](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#036)<span id="vi.xiv-p10.2"></span>.md):
meaning, not many days before. Now had he at once said, “Let these men
go,” both himself would have fallen into suspicion, and his speech would
not have been so effective: but after the examples, it acquired its own
proper force. And he mentions not one instance, but a second also:
“for,” saith the Scripture, “in the mouth of two witnesses” ([Matt.
xviii. 16](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#016.md)<span
id="vi.xiv-p10.3"></span>): and yet he had it in his power to mention
even three. “Refrain from these men.” ([Acts
5.38](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#038)<span id="vi.xiv-p10.4"></span>..md)
See how mild his manner is, and his speech not long, but concise, and
his mention even of those (impostors) how free from passion: “And all,
as many as obeyed him, were scattered.” And <span
id="fr_322"></span>[323](#fn_322.md) for all this he does not blaspheme
Christ. They heard him, all these unbelievers, heard him, these Jews.
\[“For if this council or this work be of men, it will come to
naught.”\] Well then, since it did not come to nought, it is not of men.
\[“But if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it.”\] ([Acts
5.39](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#039)<span id="vi.xiv-p11.4"></span>..md)
Once more he checks them by the impossibility and the inexpediency of
the thing, saying, “Lest haply ye be found even to fight against
God.” <span id="fr_323"></span>[324](#fn_323.md) And he does not say, If
Christ be God; but the work (itself) declares (this). He does not
pronounce upon it, either that, it is “of men,” or that it is “of God;”
but he leaves the proof to the future. “They were persuaded \[by him\].”
([Acts 5.40](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#040.md)<span
id="vi.xiv-p12.6"></span>.) Then why, it may be asked, do ye scourge
them? Such was the incontrovertible justness of his speech, they could
not look it in the face; nevertheless, they sated their own animosity;
and again they expected to terrify them in this way. By the fact also of
his saying these things not in the presence of the Apostles, he gained a
hearing more than he would otherwise have done; and then the suavity of
his discourse and the justness of what was said, helped to persuade
them. In fact, this man all but preached the Gospel. “ <span
id="fr_324"></span>[325](#fn_324.md) Ye were persuaded,” one may say, “that
ye had not strength to overthrow it. Wherefore did ye not believe?” Such
is the witness borne even by enemies. There it is four hundred, there,
four thousand: and here the first movers were twelve. Let not the number
which added itself affright you. ([Acts
2:41](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#041.md), [Acts
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#004)<span id="vi.xiv-p13.5"></span>..md)
He might also have mentioned another instance, that of the Egyptian, but
what he has spoken is fully sufficient. And he closes his speech with an
alarming topic: “Lest haply,” etc. And he does not pronounce upon it,
lest he should seem to be pleading their cause; but he reasons by way of
syllogism from the issue of the matter. And he does not venture to
pronounce that it is not of men, nor yet that it is of God; for had he
said that it was of God, they would have gainsaid him: but had he said
that it was of men, they would again have taken prompt measures.
Therefore he bids them wait for the end, saying, “Refrain.” But they
once more threaten knowing indeed that they avail nothing, but doing
after their manner. Such is the nature of wickedness: it attempts even
impossibilities.—“And after this man rose up Judas,” etc. These things
Josephus relates in detail. (*Ant.* xx. 8; ib. v. 2; xviii. 1. *B. J.*
ii. 8. 1.) But what a great thing it was that he ventured to affirm:
that it was of God, when in the sequel it received its proof from the
events! Great boldness of speech, great freedom from all respect of
persons! <span id="fr_325"></span>[326](#fn_325.md) And he does not say,
“But if ye do not overthrow it, it is of God;” but, “If it be of God, it
will not be overthrown.” “And to him they agreed.” ([Acts
5.40](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#040)<span id="vi.xiv-p14.2"></span>..md)
They reverenced the high character of the man. “And they departed from
the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to
suffer shame for the name of Christ.” ([Acts
5.41](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#041)<span id="vi.xiv-p14.3"></span>..md)
What miracles so wonderful as this? Nowhere is the like of this recorded
of the old saints: for Jeremiah indeed was scourged for the word of God,
and they threatened Elijah, and the rest: but in this case, even by this
very thing, and not only by their miracles, these showed forth the power
of God. He does not say, that they were not pained, but that though
pained they rejoiced. How does this appear? From their boldness
afterwards: they were so instant still, even after their beatings, in
preaching the word. “But in the temple,” it says, “and in every house,
they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ.” ([Acts
5.42](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#042)<span id="vi.xiv-p14.4"></span>..md)
“And in those days”—when these things were done, when there were
scourgings, when there were threatenings, when the disciples were
multiplying—also, it says, “there arose a murmuring.” ([Acts
6.1](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#001)<span id="vi.xiv-p14.5"></span>..md)
And this comes of the multitude: for it is impossible to have strict
order in a multitude. “There arose a murmuring,” etc. to,—“And <span
id="fr_326"></span>[327](#fn_326.md) a great company of the priests were
obedient to the faith.—There arose murmuring against the Hebrews”—for
that description of people seemed to be more honorable—“because their
widows were neglected in the daily ministration.” <span
id="fr_327"></span>[328](#fn_327.md) ([Acts
6.1-7](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#001)<span id="vi.xiv-p16.1"></span>..md)
So then there was a daily ministration for the widows. And observe how
he calls it a “ministration” (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xiv-p16.2"></span>διακονία</span>), and not directly alms:
extolling by this at once the doers, and those to whom it was done.
“Were neglected.” This did not arise from malice, but perhaps from the
carelessness of the multitude. And therefore he brought it forward
openly, for this was no small evil. Observe, how even in the beginning
the evils came not only from without, but also from within. For you must
not look to this only, that it was set to rights, but observe that it
was a great evil that it existed. <span
id="fr_328"></span>[329](#fn_328.md) “Then the twelve,” etc. ([Acts
6.2](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#002)<span id="vi.xiv-p17.1"></span>..md)
Do you observe <span id="fr_329"></span>[330](#fn_329.md) how outward
concerns succeed to inward? They do not act at their own discretion, but
plead for themselves to the congregation. So ought it to be done now.
“It is not reason,” says he, “that we should leave the word of God, and
serve tables.” First he puts to them the unreasonableness of the thing;
that it is not possible for both things to be done with the same
attention: just as when they were about to ordain Matthias, they first
show the necessity of the thing, that one was deficient, and there must
needs be twelve. And so here they showed the necessity; and they did it
not sooner, but waited till the murmuring arose; nor, on the other hand,
did they suffer this to spread far. And, lo! they leave the decision to
them: those who pleased all, those who of all were honestly reputed,
them they present: <span id="fr_330"></span>[331](#fn_330.md) not now
twelve, but “seven, full of the Spirit and of wisdom: well reported of”
for their conversation. ([Acts
6.3](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#003)<span id="vi.xiv-p19.1"></span>..md)
Now when Matthias was to be presented, it was said, “Therefore must one
of these men which have companied with us all the time” ([Acts
1.21](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#021)<span id="vi.xiv-p19.2"></span>.md):
but not so here: for the case was not alike. And they do not now put it
to the lot; they might indeed themselves have made the election, as
moved by the Spirit: but nevertheless, they desire the testimony of the
people. The fixing the number, and the ordaining them, and for this kind
of business, rested with them: but the choice of the men they make over
to the people, that they might not seem to act from favor: just as God
also leaves it to Moses to choose as elders those whom he knew. (<span
id="vi.xiv-p19.3"></span>[Num. xi.
16](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#016)<span id="vi.xiv-p19.4"></span>..md)
“And of wisdom.” For indeed there needs much wisdom in such
ministrations. For think not, because he hath not the word committed
unto him, that such an one has no need of wisdom: he does need it, and
much too. “But we,” saith he, “will give ourselves continually to
prayer, and to the ministry of the word.” ([Acts
6.4](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#004)<span id="vi.xiv-p19.5"></span>..md)
Again they plead for themselves, beginning and ending with this. “Will
give ourselves continually,” he saith. For so it behooved, not just to
do the mere acts, or in any chance way, but to be continually doing
them. “And the saying,” we are told, “pleased the whole multitude.”
([Acts 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#005.md),
[6](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#006)<span id="vi.xiv-p19.6"></span>..md)
This too was worthy of their wisdom. All approved of what was said so
sensible was it. “And they chose,” it says (again it is the people
(<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xiv-p19.7"></span>αὐτοί</span>) that
choose,) “Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and
Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas
a proselyte of Antioch: whom they set before the Apostles: and when they
had prayed, they laid their hands on them.” They separated them from the
multitude, and it is the people (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xiv-p19.8"></span>αὐτοί</span>) that draw them, not the Apostles
that lead them. Observe how he avoids all that is superfluous: he does
not tell in what way it was done, but that they were ordained (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xiv-p19.9"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xiv-p19.10"></span>χειροτονήθησαν</span>)
with prayer: for this is the meaning of <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xiv-p19.11"></span>χειροτονία</span>, (i.e. “putting forth the
hand,”) or ordination: the hand of the man is laid upon (the person,)
but the whole work is of God, and it is His hand which toucheth the head
of the one ordained, if he be duly ordained. “And the word of God,” it
says, “increased: and the number of the disciples multiplied.” ([Acts
6.7](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#007)<span id="vi.xiv-p19.12"></span>..md)
It is not for nothing that he says this: it shows how great is the
virtue of alms and good order. And as he is about in the sequel to
enlarge (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xiv-p19.13"></span>αὔξειν</span>) upon the affair of Stephen, he
puts first the causes which led to it. “And many,” he says, “of the
priests were obedient to the faith.” For <span
id="fr_331"></span>[332](#fn_331.md) since they perceived such to be the
mind of their ruler and teacher, they put the matter to the test of
facts.—It is also a subject for wonder, how it was that the multitude
was not divided in its choice of the men, and how it was that the
Apostles were not rejected by them. But what sort of rank these bore,
and what sort of office they received, this is what we need to learn.
Was it that of Deacons? And yet this is not the case in the Churches.
But <span id="fr_332"></span>[333](#fn_332.md) is it to the Presbyters that
the management belongs? And yet at present there was no Bishop, but the
Apostles only. Whence I think it clearly and manifestily follows, that
neither Deacons nor Presbyters is their designation: but it was for this
particular purpose that they were ordained. <span
id="fr_333"></span>[334](#fn_333.md) And this business was not simply
handed over to them without further ceremony, but the Apostles prayed
over them, that power might be given to them. But observe, I pray you,
if there were need of seven men for this, great in proportion must have
been the sums of money that flowed in, great in proportion also the
number of widows. So then the prayers were not made in an off-hand way,
but with much deliberate attention: and this office, <span
id="fr_334"></span>[335](#fn_334.md) as well as preaching, was thus brought
to good effect; for what they did, they effected mostly by the means of
these (their prayers.) Thus they were enabled to give their attention to
things spiritual; thus were these also free to undertake long journeys;
thus were these put in trust with the word. But the writer does not say
this, nor extol them, but that it was “not reason” that they should
leave the work given to them. Thus they had been taught by Moses’s
example not to undertake the management of everything by themselves.
([Num. xi. 14](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#014.md)<span
id="vi.xiv-p23.7"></span>.) “Only,” it is said, “that we should remember
the poor.” (<span id="vi.xiv-p23.8"></span>[Gal. ii.
10](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#010)<span id="vi.xiv-p23.9"></span>..md)
And <span id="fr_335"></span>[336](#fn_335.md) how did they bring these
forward? They fasted. “Look you out seven men,” etc. ([Acts
6.3](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#003)<span id="vi.xiv-p24.8"></span>..md)
It is not simply, spiritual men, but, “full of the Spirit and of
wisdom,” for it needed very great superiority of mind (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xiv-p24.9"></span>φιλοσοφίας</span>) to bear
the complainings of widows. For what profits it, that the dispenser of
alms steal not, if nevertheless he waste all, or be harsh and easily
provoked? “And they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy
Ghost.” ([Acts 6.5](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#005.md)<span
id="vi.xiv-p24.10"></span>.) And in this regard Philip also was
admirable: for it is of him that the writer says: “And we entered into
the house of Philip the Evangelist, which was one of the seven; and
abode with him.”—([Acts 21.8](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#008.md)<span
id="vi.xiv-p24.11"></span>.) Dost thou mark how matters are ordered
quite otherwise than after the matter of men? “And the number of
disciples was multiplied in Jerusalem.” ([Acts
6.7](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#007)<span id="vi.xiv-p24.12"></span>..md)
In Jerusalem the multitude increased. Wonderful, where Christ was slain,
there the preaching increased! And not only was it not the case that
some were offended then in the manner of Ananias, but the awe became
even greater: while these are scourged, those threatening, those
tempting the Spirit, those murmuring. But I would have thee remark under
what circumstances the multitude increased: after these trials, then it
was that the multitude increased, and not before. Mark also how great
the mercy of God. Of those chief-priests, of the very men who had
indignation and sore displeasure and so cried out and said, “He saved
others, Himself He cannot save;” of these same, “Many,” it says, “were
obedient unto the faith.” ([Matt. xxvii.
42](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#042)<span id="vi.xiv-p24.13"></span>..md)

<span id="vi.xiv-p25"></span>Him therefore let us also imitate. He
received them, and did not cast them out. So let us requite those our
enemies, who have wrought us even numberless ills. Whatever good thing
we may have, let us impart to them: let us not pass them by, in our acts
of beneficence. For if we ought, by suffering ill, to sate their rage,
much more, by doing them good: for this is a less thing than the other.
For it is not all alike, to do good to an enemy, and to be willing to
suffer greater wrongs than he wishes (to inflict): <span
id="fr_336"></span>[337](#fn_336.md) from the one we shall come on to the
other. This is the dignity of Christ’s disciples. Those crucified Him,
when He had come for the very purpose of doing them good; His disciples
they scourged; and after all this, He admits them to the same honor with
His disciples, making them equally partakers of His gifts. I beseech
you, let us be imitators of Christ: in this regard it is possible to
imitate Him: this makes a man like unto God: this is more than human.
Let us hold fast to Mercy: she is the schoolmistress and teacher of that
higher Wisdom. He that has learnt to show mercy to the distressed, will
learn also not to resent injuries; he that has learnt this, will be able
to do good even to his enemies. Let us learn to feel for the ills our
neighbors suffer, and we shall learn to endure the ills they inflict.
Let us ask the person himself who ill-treats us, whether he does not
condemn himself? would he not be glad to show a nobler spirit (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xiv-p26.10"></span>φιλοσοφεἵν</span>)? must
he not own that his behavior is nothing but passion, that it is
little-minded, pitiful? would he not like to be of those who are wronged
and are silent, and not of those who do wrong, and are beside themselves
with passion? can he go away not admiring the patient sufferer? Do not
imagine that this makes men despicable. Nothing makes men so despicable,
as insolent and injurious behavior: nothing makes men so respectable, as
endurance under insolence and injury. For the one is a ruffian, the
other a philosopher; the one is less than man, the other is equal to
angels. For though he be inferior to the wrong-doer, yet, for all that,
he has the power, if he had the mind, to be revenged. And besides, the
one is pitied by all, the other hated. What then? The former will be
much the better of the two: for everybody will treat the one as a
madman, the other as a man of sense. He <span
id="fr_337"></span>[338](#fn_337.md) cannot speak of him in evil sort: yea,
thou fearest, says one, lest perchance he be not such (as thou wouldest
represent). Best that thou speak not evil in thy thought even; next,
that thou speak it not to another. Pray not then to God against this
man: if thou hear him evil-spoken of, take his part: say, It was passion
that spoke such words, not the man; say, It was anger, not my friend:
his madness, not his heart. Thus let us account of each offence. Wait
not for the fire to be kindled, but check it before it comes to that: do
not exasperate the savage beast, rather do not suffer it to become
exasperated: for thou wilt no longer be able to check it, if once the
flame be kindled. For what has the man called thee? “Thou fool and
simpleton.” And which then is liable to the name? the called, or the
caller? For the one, be he ever so wise, gets the character of being a
fool: but the other, even if he be a simpleton, gets credit for being
wise, and of philosophic temper. Say, which is the simpleton? he who
alleges against another what is untrue, or he who even under such
treatment is unmoved? For if it be the mark of true philosophy to be
unmoved however moved; to fall into a passion when none moves to
anger—what folly is it! I say not yet, how sore a manner of punishment
is in store for those who utter such reproaches and revilings against
their neighbor. But how? has he called thee “a low fellow and low-born,
a sorry creature and of sorry extraction?” Again he has turned the taunt
against himself. For the other will appear worthy and respectable, but
he a sorry creature indeed: for to cast up such things, that is to say,
meanness of birth, as a disgrace, is little-minded indeed: while the
other will be thought a great and admirable character, because he thinks
nothing of such a taunt, and is no more affected by it than if he were
told <span id="fr_338"></span>[339](#fn_338.md) that he had about him any
other ordinary and quite indifferent circumstance. But does he call thee
“adulterer,” and such like? At this thou mayest even laugh: for, when
the conscience is not smitten, there can be no occasion for wrath. \* \*
For when one has considered what bad and disgraceful disclosures he
makes, still for all that, there is no need to grieve. He has but laid
bare now, what everybody must be apprised of by and bye: meanwhile, as
regards himself he has shown all men that he is not to be trusted, for
that he knows not how to screen his neighbor’s faults: he has disgraced
himself more than he has the other; has stopped up against himself every
harbor: has made terrible to himself the bar at which he must hereafter
be tried. For not the person (whose secrets are betrayed) will be the
object of everybody’s aversion, but he, who where he ought not to have
raised the veil, has stripped off the clothes. But speak thou nothing of
the secrets thou knowest: hold thou thy peace if thou wouldest bear off
the good fame. For not only wilt thou overthrow what has been spoken,
and hide it: but thou wilt also bring about another capital result: thou
wilt stop sentence being given against thyself. Does somebody speak evil
of thee? Say thou: “Had he known all, he would not have spoken only thus
much.”—So you admire what has been said, and are delighted with it? Aye,
but you must follow it. For when we tell you all <span
id="fr_339"></span>[340](#fn_339.md) these maxims of the heathen moralists,
it is not because Scripture does not contain hundreds of such sayings,
but because these are of more force to put you to the blush. As in fact
Scripture itself is wont to use this appeal to our sense of shame; for,
instance, when it says, “Do ye even as the heathen.” (<span
id="vi.xiv-p29.12"></span>[Jer. xxxv.
3](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#003)<span id="vi.xiv-p29.13"></span>..md)
And the prophet Jeremiah brought forward into public view the children
of Rechab, how they would not consent to violate the command of their
father.—Miriam and her company spake evil of Moses, and he immediately
begged them off from their punishment; nay, would not so much as let it
be known that his cause was avenged. ([Num.
12](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#000)<span id="vi.xiv-p29.14"></span>..md)
But not so we: on the contrary, this is what we most desire; to have all
men know that they have not passed unpunished. How long shall we breathe
of the earth?—One party cannot make a fight. Pluck the madmen from both
sides, you will exasperate them the more: but pluck from right or from
left, and you have quenched the passion. The striker, if he has to do
with one who will not put up with blows, is the more set on: but if with
one who yields, he is the sooner unnerved, and his blow is spent upon
himself. For no practised pugilist so unnerves the strength of his
antagonist, as does a man who being injuriously treated makes no return.
For the other only goes off ashamed, and condemned, first by his own
conscience, and secondly by all the lookers on. And there is a proverb
too, which says, that “to honor another, is to honor one’s self”:
therefore also to abuse another is to abuse one’s self. None, I repeat,
will be able to harm us, unless we harm ourselves; nor will any make me
poor, unless I make myself such. For come, let us look at it in this
way. Suppose that I have a beggarly soul, and let all lavish all their
substance upon me, what of that? So long as the soul is not changed, it
is all in vain. Suppose I have a noble soul, and let all men take from
me my substance: what of that? So long as you do not make the soul
beggarly, no harm is done. Suppose my life be impure, and let all men
say just the contrary of me: what of that? For though they say it, yet
they do not judge thus of me in their heart. Again, suppose my life be
pure, and let all say of me just the reverse: and what of that? For in
their own conscience they will condemn themselves: since they are not
persuaded of what they say. Just as we ought not to admit the praise, so
neither the criminations. And why say I these things? None will ever be
able to plot against us, nor lay us under any evil charge, if we choose
(that they shall not). For how now, I ask you? Let him drag me into a
court of justice, let him lay vexatious informations, let him, if you
will, have the very soul out of me: and what of that? for a little
while, undeservedly to suffer these things, what does it signify?
“Well, <span id="fr_340"></span>[341](#fn_340.md) but this,” say you, “is
of itself an evil.” Well, but of itself this is a good, to suffer
undeservedly. What? would you have the suffering to be deserved? Let me
mention again a piece of philosophy, from one of the sages. A certain
person, says the story, had been put to death. And one of the sage’s
disciples said to him, “Woe is me, that he should have suffered
unjustly!” The other turned upon him, “Why, how now?” said he, “would
you have had him justly suffer?” (Socrates ap. Diog. Laert. and Xen.
*Mem.* Socr.) John also, was not he unjustly put to death? Which then do
you rather pity: them that justly suffer death, or \[him? <span
id="fr_341"></span>[342](#fn_341.md) Do you not count them miserable,
while\] him you even admire? Then what is a man injured, when from death
itself he has got great gain, not merely no hurt? If indeed the man had
been immortal, and this made him mortal, no doubt it would be a hurt:
but if he be mortal, and in the course of nature must expect death a
little later, and his enemy has but expedited his death, and glory with
it, what is the harm? Let us but have our soul in good order, and there
will be no harm from without. But thou art not in a condition of glory?
And what of that? That which is true of wealth, the same holds for
glory: if I be magnanimous (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xiv-p31.6"></span>μεγαλοπρεπής</span>), I shall need none; if
vainglorious, the more I get, the more I shall want. In this way shall I
most become illustrious, and obtain greater glory; namely, if I despise
glory. Knowing these things, let us be thankful to Him Who hath freely
given us such a life, and let us ensue it unto His glory; for to Him
belongs the glory, forever. Amen.

<span id="vi.xiv-p5"></span> In the Clementine *Recogn.* i. 65, Gamaliel
is spoken of as having been early a Christian in secret. Lucian the
Presbyter <span class="c14"><span id="vi.xiv-p5.1"></span>a.d.</span>
415, writes an account of the discovery in consequence of a vision in
which Gamaliel himself appeared to him, of the reliques of St. Stephen,
together with those of Nicodemus and Gamaliel. See note on St. Augustin
*Comm. on St. John,* p. 1048. Photius, *Cod.* 171, p. 199 read in a work
of Eustratius how Gamaliel was baptized by St. Peter and St. John.
(According to the Jewish tradition, Wolf. *Bibl. Hebr.* ii. 882. he died
President of the Sanhedrim, eighteen years after the fall of Jerusalem.)

<span id="vi.xiv-p10"></span> Omitted in the old text: supplied by
E.—Below, E. omits, “for, saith the Scripture, in the mouth of two
witnesses:” and amplifies the rest, adding, “even a third,
superabundantly: both showing how well he himself speaks, and leading
them away from their sanguinary purpose.”

<span id="fn_322"></span>[i:323](1110019.htm#fr_322.md) <span

<span id="vi.xiv-p11"></span> Edd. from E. “Saying this, he speaks
nothing blasphemous against Christ, but what he most wishes, he effects.
‘If,’ says he, ‘it be of men, it will come to naught.’ Here he seems to
me to put it to them by way of syllogism, and to say: Consequently,
since it has not come to naught, it is not of man. ‘Lest haply ye be
found even to fight against God.’ This he said to check them,”
etc.—Below, <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xiv-p11.1"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xiv-p11.2"></span>λλὰ τὸ ἔργον τοῦτο δηλοῖ</span>, might be
rendered, “but he is declaring this work” (viz. “if this work be of
men,” etc.): the modern text, <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xiv-p11.3"></span>τὸ γάρ ἔργον τοῦτο ἐδήλου</span>.

<span id="fn_323"></span>[i:324](1110019.htm#fr_323.md) <span
id="vi.xiv-p11.5"></span>

<span id="vi.xiv-p12"></span> Meyer finds in the expression of Gamaliel
([Acts 5:38](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#038.md),
[39](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#039)<span id="vi.xiv-p12.1"></span>.md):
“if it *be* of men—<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xiv-p12.2"></span>ἔ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xiv-p12.3"></span>αν ἦ ἐξ ἀνθρώπων</span>” and “if it *is* of
God—<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xiv-p12.4"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xiv-p12.5"></span>ι δὲ ἐκ θεοῦ ἐστίν</span>”
an indication that he leaned to the latter opinion. While this
distinction is grammatically valid it can scarcely be justified as
intentional. Gamaliel, although tolerant toward Christianity, as the
Pharisaic party in general were at this time, was not a Christian in
secret, but an orthodox Jew. His advice was politic even from a Jewish
point of view. He saw, as the more bitter party did not, that this sort
of opposition would only serve to rouse all the energy and perseverance
of the Christian disciples and thus indirectly tend to the increase and
spread of their doctrines among the people.—G.B.S.

<span id="fn_324"></span>[i:325](1110019.htm#fr_324.md) <span
id="vi.xiv-p12.7"></span>

<span id="vi.xiv-p13"></span> E. F. D. and Edd. (except Savile) add,
<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xiv-p13.1"></span>μᾶλλον δὲ μονονουχὶ
τοιαῦτα δικαιολογούμενος τρὸς αὐτοὺς ἀποτείνεται</span>. “Or rather he
all but with just remonstrance thus expostulates with them: “Ye were
persuaded,” etc. Below, <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xiv-p13.2"></span>᾽</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xiv-p13.3"></span>Εκεῖ τετρακόσιοι, ἐκεῖ τετρακισχίλιοι· καὶ ὧδε
κ. τ. λ</span>. But the mention of the four thousand, here referred to
the second instance (Judas of Galilee), is in fact derived from the case
of the Egyptian, [Acts 21.38](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#038.md)<span
id="vi.xiv-p13.4"></span>, being the third instance which “he might have
cited.” Accordingly the modern text substitutes, “There four hundred
stood up, and after this a great multitude.”

<span id="fn_325"></span>[i:326](1110019.htm#fr_325.md) <span
id="vi.xiv-p13.6"></span>

<span id="vi.xiv-p14"></span> E. and Edd. omit the following sentence,
substituting the first two clauses of [Acts
5.40](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#040.md)<span id="vi.xiv-p14.1"></span>
and after “the character of the man,” add, “wherefore also they desist
from their purpose of killing the Apostles, and having only scourged
they dismiss them.”

<span id="fn_326"></span>[i:327](1110019.htm#fr_326.md) <span
id="vi.xiv-p14.6"></span>

<span id="vi.xiv-p15"></span> Standing here by itself, this last clause
of [Acts 6.7](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#007.md)<span
id="vi.xiv-p15.1"></span> is quite out of its place. It is best
explained as marking the conclusion of the text [Acts
6.1-7](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#001.md)<span id="vi.xiv-p15.2"></span>
here again read out. In the old text it is followed by the comment,
<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xiv-p15.3"></span>᾽</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xiv-p15.4"></span>Εκεῖνο γὰρ τὸ γένος ἐδόκει
τιμιώτερον εἶναι·</span> as if “this description of people” meant the
priests: and then, “And there arose,” it says, “a murmuring,” [Acts
6.1](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#001.md)<span id="vi.xiv-p15.5"></span>. We
have restored the comment to its proper place.—The innovator adds as
comment on [Acts 6.7](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#007.md)<span
id="vi.xiv-p15.6"></span>: <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xiv-p15.7"></span>Τοῦτο αἰνιττομένου ἐστὶ καὶ δεικνύντος ὅτι ἀφ᾽
ὧν ὁ κατὰ Χριστοῦ θάνατος ἐσκευάσθη, πολλοὶ ἀπὸ τούτων
πιστεύουσιν</span>. “This is by way of hint, to show that of those very
persons, by whose machinations the sentence of death against Christ was
procured, of those same many believe. “There arose,” it says, “a
murmuring,” etc. And so Edd.

<span id="fn_327"></span>[i:328](1110019.htm#fr_327.md) <span
id="vi.xiv-p15.8"></span>

<span id="vi.xiv-p16"></span> The murmuring arose from the “Hellenists”
who are not mentioned by Chrys. (probably because of a defect of the
text). These Hellenists are distinguished from the “Hebrews” and were
probably Greek-speaking Jews resident in Jerusalem who had become
Christians and who are here distinguished by their language from the
great mass of the Jewish Christians who spoke the vernacular.—G.B.S.

<span id="fn_328"></span>[i:329](1110019.htm#fr_328.md) <span
id="vi.xiv-p16.3"></span>

<span id="vi.xiv-p17"></span> The neglect here referred to was
doubtless, as Chrys. says, unintentional (vs. Meyer) and arose from the
increasing difficulties of administering the affairs of so large a
society as the Christian community at Jerusalem had now become, on the
plan of a common treasury. The narrative gives the impression that the
complaint was not unfounded. It is not unlikely that the natural
jealousy between the Greek and Palestinian Jews may have sharpened the
sense of neglect. This is the first record of dissension in the
Christian Church. We may note thus early the conditions which tended to
develop a Jewish and a Gentile party in the church; the germs of
dissenting sects of Ebionites and Gnostics which developed into so many
dangerous and harmful forms in the apostolic, and especially in the
post-apostolic age.—G.B.S.

<span id="fn_329"></span>[i:330](1110019.htm#fr_329.md) <span

id="vi.xiv-p18.1"></span>῾</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xiv-p18.2"></span>Θρᾷς τὰ ἔξω διαδεχόμενα τὰ ἔσω</span>; E. omits
this and so Edd. The antithesis here seems to be, not, as before, of
evils from without and from within the Church; but of the concerns of
the body and of the soul.

<span id="fn_330"></span>[i:331](1110019.htm#fr_330.md) <span
id="vi.xiv-p18.3"></span>

<span id="vi.xiv-p19"></span> E. D. F. Morel. Ben. omit this sentence,
and go on with, “Now when Matthias,” etc. Savile: “And a very good
decision this is. And they present seven, not now twelve, full,” etc.

<span id="fn_331"></span>[i:332](1110019.htm#fr_331.md) <span

τοιαῦτα ἀποφηνάμενον, ἀπὸ τῶν ἔργων λοῖπον τὴν πεῖραν ἐλάμβανον</span>.
Meaning, perhaps, that these priests, acting upon the counsel of
Gamaliel, put the question to the test of facts and experience, and
learned that it was of God.—In the next sentence, a covert censure seems
to be implied: q.d. “Would it be so now? Would there not be parties and
factions in the choosing of the men? Would not the Bishop’s overture be
rejected, were he to propose a plan for ridding himself of the like
distracting demands upon his time?”

<span id="fn_332"></span>[i:333](1110019.htm#fr_332.md) <span

id="vi.xiv-p21.1"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xiv-p21.2"></span>λλὰ τῶν πρεσβυτέρων ἐστὶν ἡ οἰκονομία</span>,
interrogatively (so in Conc. Quinisext. Can. xvi., see below), but in
the Edd. this is put affirmatively; Ben. *Sed presbyterorum erat
œconomia. Atqui nullus adhuc erat episcopus.* Erasm. *Sed presbyterorum
est hæc dispensatio, tametsi nullus adhuc esset episcopus.*” But to say
that the <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xiv-p21.3"></span>οἰκονομία</span>, i.e. stewardship and
management of Church funds (in Chrysostom’s time), was vested in the
presbyters, would be contrary to facts. Therefore we take it
interrogatively: the answer not expressed, being, “No: it belongs to the
Bishops.” Perhaps, however, the passage may be restored thus; <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xiv-p21.4"></span>᾽</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xiv-p21.5"></span>Αλλὰ τῶν
πρεσβυτέρων</span>; ᾽<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xiv-p21.6"></span>Αλλὰ τῶν ἐπισκόπων</span> (or <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xiv-p21.7"></span>Οὐδὲ τῶν πρεσβ</span>.)
<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xiv-p21.8"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xiv-p21.9"></span>στὶν ἡ οἰκ. Καίτοι κ. τ.
λ</span>. “Well, was it that of presbyters? Nay, this stewardship
belongs to Bishops. (Or, No, neither does it belong to presbyters.) And
yet,” etc.—The following sentence, “῞<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xiv-p21.10"></span>Οθεν οὔτε διακόνων οὔτε πρεσβυτέρων
οἶμαι</span> (Cat. om.) <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xiv-p21.11"></span>τὸ ὄνομα εἶναι δῆλον καὶ φανερόν</span>, as
the text stands, might seem to mean, “Whence I think that neither of
deacons nor of presbyters is the name clearly and manifestly expressed:”
i.e. “there is no express and clear mention in this narrative either of
deacons or of presbyters: and I account for this circumstance by the
fact, that there were no Bishops.” Ben. *Unde puto nec diaconorum nec
presbyterorum tunc fuisse nomen admissum nec manifestum.* But
transposing <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xiv-p21.12"></span>οἶμαι</span> and <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xiv-p21.13"></span>εἶναι</span>, or indeed even as the words
stand, we get the sense expressed in the translation, which is more
suitable. So Erasmus: *Unde neque diaconorum neque presbyterorum nomen
esse opinor quod clarum ac manifestum.* St. Chrys. says, “Their
appellation and office is neither deacons nor presbyters: they were
ordained upon a special emergency.”—It seems to have been commonly held
in earlier times, that <span id="vi.xiv-p21.14"></span>[Acts vi.
1-6](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#001.md)<span id="vi.xiv-p21.15"></span> is
the history of the first institution of the Diaconate. Thus the Council
of Nicocæsarea ordains (<span class="c14"><span
id="vi.xiv-p21.16"></span>a.d.</span> 314) that in each city, however
large, the number of deacons according to the Canon ought to be seven,
and for proof appeals to this history, <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xiv-p21.17"></span>πεισθήσῃ δὲ ἀπὸ τῆς βίβλου τῶν πράξεων</span>.
In the third century, Cornelius *Ep. ad Fab.* ap. Eus. *H. E.* vi. 43
states, that the clergy of Rome consisted of one Bishop, forty-six
presbyters, seven deacons, etc. (Accordingly St. Jerome, *Ep.* 146 *al.*
101 *ad Evang.* remarks: *Diaconos paucitas honorabiles facit.* Comp.
Sozomen. vii. 19.) But the rule which assigned to each Bishop seven
deacons, neither more nor less, was not always followed in large cities,
as appears even from the Canon above cited: how greatly that number was
exceeded in later times, may be seen in the *Novellæ* of Justinian, when
it is enacted (iii. c. 1.) that the number of deacons in the
metropolitan Church at Constantinople should be a hundred. The Council
or Councils commonly called the fifth and sixth General (Conc.
Quinisextum, or Trullanum,) held under the same Emperor, <span
class="c14"><span id="vi.xiv-p21.18"></span>a.d.</span> 692, sanctioned
this departure from the earlier rule, in the following Canon (xvi).
“Whereas the Book of Acts relates that seven deacons were appointed by
the Apostles, and the Council of Neocæsarea in its Canons determines
that “The number of deacons in each city,” etc. (as above): we, having
applied the sense of the Fathers to the Apostolic text, find that the
said history relates not to the deacons who minister in the mysteries,
but to the service of tables, etc.: the history in the Acts being as
follows, “And in those days,” etc. (<span
id="vi.xiv-p21.19"></span>[Acts vi.
1-6](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#001)<span id="vi.xiv-p21.20"></span>..md)
The doctor of the Church, John Chrysostom, expounding the same, thus
speaks: “It is a subject for wonder…….neither deacons nor presbyters is
their designation,” (as above.) Hereupon therefore do we also publish,
that the aforesaid seven deacons be not taken to mean those which
minister in the mysteries, as in the doctrine above rehearsed: but that
these are they which were charged with the service of the common need of
the people then gathered together; albeit herein these be unto us a
pattern of humane and diligent attendance on them that be in necessity.

id="vi.xiv-p21.21"></span>

<span id="vi.xiv-p22"></span> There is no sufficient ground to doubt
that this narrative describes the formation of the diaconate which we

Tim. iii. 8-12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#008.md)<span
id="vi.xiv-p22.3"></span>). Although the word <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xiv-p22.4"></span>διάκονος</span> does not here occur, we have
the corresponding verb <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xiv-p22.5"></span>διακονεῖν</span> and abstract noun <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xiv-p22.6"></span>διακονία</span> ([Acts
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#001.md),
[2](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#002)<span id="vi.xiv-p22.7"></span>.md).
The chief grounds of this opinion are: (1) the substantial identity of
the duties here described and those of the later diaconate; (2) the
almost universal testimony of patristic tradition to their identity: (3)
the continuance for centuries of the number seven in the diaconate of
churches (like that at Rome) where more than seven would naturally be
required, out of deference to the apostolic mode. See Lightfoot, *Com.
on Philippians,* pp. 187–9.—G.B.S.

ἠνύετο·</span>—<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xiv-p23.2"></span>τοῦτο</span>, the “serving of tables” itself:
<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xiv-p23.3"></span>οὕτως</span>, by this
arrangement. <span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xiv-p23.4"></span>Τὰ γὰρ
πλείω ταύταις ἤνυον·</span> the more time the Apostles had for prayer,
the better for the Church: so much depended on their prayers. Therefore
the plan was every way beneficial: <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xiv-p23.5"></span>οὕτω τὰ πνευματικὰ ἐπελέγοντο</span>, (Erasm.
*adnumerabantur,* Ben. *præferebantur,* but the meaning is, “they chose
to themselves,”) <span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xiv-p23.6"></span>οὕτω
καὶ ἀποδημίας ἐστέλλοντο, οὕτως ἐνεχειρίσθησαν οὗτοι τὸν λόγον</span>:
“by this arrangement, the Apostles were free to give their undivided
attention to spiritual matters; to leave Jerusalem, if need were, on
journeys to distant places: by this arrangement, in short, the Word was
their proper charge—not secular matters, such as Bishops are now
burdened with, in addition to their proper duties,” Comp. note 1, p. 90.
He adds: The writer, indeed, does not say all this, nor extol the
devotion with which the Apostles gave themselves up to their work, and
how beneficial the arrangement proved: but it is said, “It is not
reason,” etc. Moses had set the example in this regard: and in token of
their concern for the poor, observe the charge which they afterwards
gave to Paul and Barnabas, to “remember the poor.”

<span id="vi.xiv-p24"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xiv-p24.1"></span>Πῶς δὲ προῆγον τούτους</span>; <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xiv-p24.2"></span>᾽</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xiv-p24.3"></span>Ενήστευον</span>. Edd. from
E., “But how they also brought these forward, learn thou. They fasted,
they continued in prayer. This ought also to be done now.”—As there is
no mention of fasting in [Acts vi.
1-6](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#001.md)<span id="vi.xiv-p24.4"></span>
perhaps this refers to the history xiii. 2, 3 of the mission of Paul and
Barnabas, to which he has just alluded.—Below, <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xiv-p24.5"></span>καὶ ταύτῃ δὲ θαυμαστὸς ἦν ἁ Φ</span>. The
clause to which this refers is misplaced in the old text, viz. before
the sentence, “In Jerusalem,” etc. where E. and Edd. restore the proper
clause of [Acts 6.7](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#007.md)<span
id="vi.xiv-p24.6"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xiv-p24.7"></span>καὶ ἐπληθύνετο, κ. τ. λ</span>. The connection
is: “The Apostles desired seven men full of the Holy Ghost and of
wisdom:” and such was Stephen, “a man full of faith and of the Holy
Ghost:” such doubtless were the others likewise; (supra, p. 88)
certainly Philip was eminent in this regard, for \[besides the history
of his preaching at Samaria, ch. viii.\] he is afterwards conspicuous in
the history as Philip the Evangelist.

Erasm. “*Et majora voluisse pati, vel velle.*” Ben. *Et majora velle
pati.*” But the meaning is, “To be ready to suffer greater wrongs than
an enemy chooses to inflict:” alluding to [Matt. v.

class="Greek"><span id="vi.xiv-p26.6"></span>βούλεσθαι</span> we read
<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xiv-p26.7"></span>βούλεται</span>, the

id="vi.xiv-p26.8"></span>ἢ</span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xiv-p26.9"></span>βούλεσθαι</span>, “than that he should wish

sentences we seem to have a string of apothegms from heathen moralists:

to be corrupt, and the <span class="c14"><span

reading adopted by Edd. from E. F. D. is only meant for restoration:

usual in cases of difficulty, omits the passage as unintelligible.
Whether <span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xiv-p27.10"></span>φησὶν</span>
denotes a citation or an interlocution, and whether <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xiv-p27.11"></span>ἦ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xiv-p27.12"></span>ν</span> is the first or
the third person, must be left doubtful; but the words might be
rendered, “Lest perchance I, says he, (i.e. the person attacked), be not
such.” Below, <span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xiv-p27.13"></span>μὴ
ἐντύχῃς κατὰ τούτου τῷ Θεῷ</span> is strangely rendered by Erasm. *Ne in
hoc cum Deo pugnes:* “Lest herein thou fight against God.”

person has been guilty of some immorality, which the other publicly
exposes.

answer made to Apollodorus, “a simple-minded but affectionate disciple
of Socrates. This, said he, O Socrates, is what hurts me most, that I
see thee unjustly put to death. And he, stroking the head of his
disciple, replied: And wouldest thou, my friend, rather see me justly
than unjustly put to death?” Down. ap. Sav.
