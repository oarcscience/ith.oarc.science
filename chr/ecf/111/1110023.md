<span id="vi.xviii-p2"></span>[Acts VII.

<span id="vi.xviii-p3"></span>“When they heard these things, they were
cut to “the heart, and they gnashed on him with their teeth.”

<span id="vi.xviii-p4"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="vi.xviii-p4.1"></span>See, <span id="fr_401"></span>[402](#fn_401.md)
</span> once more, the wrong-doers in trouble. Just as the Jews are
perplexed, saying, “What are we to do with these men?” so these also are
“cut to the heart.” ([Acts 4.16](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#016.md)<span
id="vi.xviii-p5.8"></span>.) And yet it was he that had good right to be
incensed, who, having done no wrong, was treated like a criminal, and
was spitefully calumniated. But the calumniators had the worst of it in
the end. So true is that saying, which I am ever repeating, “Ill to do,
is ill to fare.” And yet he (in his charges against them) resorted to no
calumny, but proved (what he said). So sure are we, when we are
shamefully borne down in a matter wherein we have a clear conscience, to
be none the worse for it.—“If <span id="fr_402"></span>[403](#fn_402.md)
they desired,” say you, “to kill him, how was it that they did not take
occasion, out of what he said, that they might kill him?” They would
fain have a fair-seeming plea to put upon their outrage. “Well then, was
not the insulting them a fair plea?” It was not his doing, if they were
insulted: it was the Prophet’s accusation of them. And besides, they did
not wish it to look as if they killed him because of what he had said
against them—just as they acted in the case of Christ; no, but for
impiety: now <span id="fr_403"></span>[404](#fn_403.md) this word of his
was the expression of piety. Wherefore, as they attempted, besides
killing him, to hurt his reputation also, “they were cut to the heart.”
For they were afraid lest he should on the contrary become an object of
even greater reverence. Therefore, just what they did in Christ’s case,
the same they do here also. For as He said, “Ye shall see the Son of Man
sitting on the right hand of God” ([Matt. xxvi.
64](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#064)<span id="vi.xviii-p7.5"></span>.md),
and they, calling it blasphemy, “ran upon Him;” just so was it here.
There, they “rent their garments;” here, they “stopped their ears. But
he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up steadfastly into heaven, and
saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God, and
said, Behold I see the heavens opened, and the Son of Man standing on
the right hand of God. Then they cried out with a loud voice, and
stopped their ears, and ran upon him with one accord, and cast him out
of the city, and stoned him.” ([Acts
7.55-58](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#055.md)<span
id="vi.xviii-p7.6"></span>.) And yet, if he lied, they ought to have
thought him beside himself, and to have let him go.—But he wished to
bring them over, “and said, Behold,” etc., for, since he had spoken of
Christ’s death, and had said nothing of His resurrection, he would fain
add this doctrine also. “Standing at the right hand of God.” And in this
manner He appeared to him: <span id="fr_404"></span>[405](#fn_404.md) that,
were it but so, the Jews might receive Him: for since the (idea of His)
sitting (at the right hand of God) was offensive to them, for the
present he brings forward only what relates to His Resurrection. This is
the reason also why his face was glorified. For God, being merciful,
desired to make their machinations the means of recalling them unto
Himself. And see, how many signs are wrought! “And cast him out of the
city, and stoned him.” Here again, “without the city,” and even in
death, Confession and Preaching. ([Heb. xiii.
21](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#021)<span id="vi.xviii-p8.10"></span>..md)
“And the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man’s feet, whose
name was Saul. And they stoned Stephen, calling <span
id="fr_405"></span>[406](#fn_405.md) upon God, and saying, Lord Jesus,
receive my spirit.” ([Acts 7.59](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#059.md)<span
id="vi.xviii-p9.2"></span>.) This is meant to show them that he is not
perishing, and to teach them. “And he knelt down, and cried with a loud
voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge.” ([Acts
7.60](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#060)<span id="vi.xviii-p9.3"></span>..md)
To clear himself, and show that neither were his former words prompted
by passion, he says, “Lord” “lay not this sin to their charge”: wishing
also even in this way to win them over. For to show that he forgave
their wrath and rage in murdering him, and that his own soul was free
from all passion, was the way to make his saying to be favorably
received.

<span id="vi.xviii-p10"></span>“And Saul was consenting unto his death.”
Hereupon arises a persecution, and it becomes a great one. “And at that
time there was a great persecution against the Church which was at
Jerusalem. And they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of
Judea and Samaria, except the Apostles.” ([Acts
8.1](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#001)<span id="vi.xviii-p10.1"></span>..md)
Mark how once more God permits temptations to arise; mark, and well
observe, how the events are ordered by Divine Providence. They were
admired because of the signs: being scourged, they were none the worse
for it: (some) were ordained in the matter of the widows <span
id="fr_406"></span>[407](#fn_406.md) : the word increased: once more, God
permits a great hindrance to arise. And a persecution of no ordinary
kind \[“and they were all scattered,” etc.\]; for they feared their
enemies, now become more daring: and at the same time it is shown that
they were but men, these that were afraid, that fled. For, that thou
mayest not say after these things that <span
id="fr_407"></span>[408](#fn_407.md) by grace alone they effected (what
they did), they were also persecuted, and themselves became more
timorous, while their adversaries were more daring. “And were all
scattered abroad,” it says, “except the Apostles.” But this was divinely
ordered, so that they should no longer all sit there in Jerusalem. “And
devout men,” it says, “carried Stephen to his burial, and made great
lamentation over him.” ([Acts 8.2](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#002.md)<span
id="vi.xviii-p12.3"></span>.) If they were “devout,” why did they “make
great lamentation over him?” They were not yet perfect. The man was
gracious and amiable: this also shows that they were men—not their fear
alone, but their grief and lamentation. Who would not have wept to see
that mild, that lamb-like person stoned, and lying dead? <span
id="fr_408"></span>[409](#fn_408.md) Fit eulogy to be spoken over his grave
has the Evangelist recorded, in this one speech, “Lay not this sin to
their charge.”—“And made,” he says, “great lamentation over him.”—But
let us look over again what has been said.

<span id="vi.xviii-p14"></span>He <span
id="fr_409"></span>[410](#fn_409) mentions the cause of his (angelic.md)
appearance (Recapitulation, [Acts
7:54](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#054.md), [Acts
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#002.md)<span
id="vi.xviii-p15.4"></span>.); “But he, being full of the Holy Ghost,
looked up steadfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus
standing on the right hand of God.” And when he said, “I see the heavens
opened, they stopped their ears, and ran upon him with one accord.”
([Acts 7:56](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#056.md),
[57](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#057)<span id="vi.xviii-p15.5"></span>..md)
And yet in what respect are these things deserving of accusation? “Upon
him,” the man who has wrought such miracles, the man who has prevailed
over all in speech, the man who can hold such discourse! As if they had
got the very thing they wanted, they straightway give full scope to
their rage. “And the witnesses,” he says, “laid down their clothes at
the feet of a young man, whose name was Saul.” ([Acts
7.58](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#058.md)<span
id="vi.xviii-p15.6"></span>.) Observe how particularly he relates what
concerns Paul, to show thee that the Power which wrought in him was of
God. But after all these things, not only did he not believe, but also
aimed at Him with a thousand hands: for this is why it says, “And Saul
was consenting unto his death.”—And this blessed man does not simply
pray, but does it with earnestness: “having kneeled down.” Mark his
divine death! So long <span id="fr_410"></span>[411](#fn_410.md) only the
Lord permitted the soul to remain in him. “And having said this, he fell
asleep.” ([Acts 7.60](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#060.md)<span
id="vi.xviii-p16.4"></span>.)—“And they were all scattered abroad
throughout the region of Judea and Samaria. ([Acts
8.1](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#001)<span id="vi.xviii-p16.5"></span>..md)
And now without scruple they had intercourse with Samaria, whereas it
had been said to them, “Go not into the way of the Gentiles” “and into
any city of the Samaritans enter ye not.” ([Matt. x.
5](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#005)<span id="vi.xviii-p16.6"></span>..md)
“Except the Apostles,” it says: they, in this way also, wishing to win
the Jews,—but not to leave the city,—and to be the means of inspiring
others with boldness.

<span id="vi.xviii-p17"></span>“As for Saul, he made havoc of the
Church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed
them to prison.” ([Acts 8.3](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#003.md)<span
id="vi.xviii-p17.1"></span>.) Great was his frenzy: that he was alone,
that he even entered into houses: for indeed he was ready to give his
life for the Law. “Haling,” it says, “men and women:” mark both the
confidence, and the violence, and the frenzy. All that fell into his
hands, he put to all manner of ill-treatment: for in consequence of the
recent murder, he was become more daring. “Therefore they that were
scattered abroad went everywhere preaching the word. Then Philip went
down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ unto them. And the
people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake,
hearing and seeing the miracles which he did. For unclean spirits,
crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed with them:
and many taken with palsies, and that were lame, were healed. And there
was great joy in that city. But there was a certain man, called Simon,
which before time in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the
people of Samaria.” ([Acts 8.4-9](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#004.md)<span
id="vi.xviii-p17.2"></span>.) Observe <span
id="fr_411"></span>[412](#fn_411.md) another trial, this affair of Simon.
“Giving out,” it says, “that he was himself some great one. To whom they
all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the
great power of God. And to him they had regard, because that of long
time he had bewitched them with sorceries. But when they believed Philip
preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of
Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women. Then Simon himself
believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and
wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done. Now when the
Apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the
word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John: who, when they were
come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost.”
([Acts 8.10-15](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#010.md)<span
id="vi.xviii-p18.10"></span>.) And (yet) great signs had been done: how
then had they not received the Spirit? They had received the Spirit,
namely, of remission of sins: but the Spirit of miracles they had not
received. “For as yet He was fallen upon none of them: only they were
baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. Then laid they their hands on
them, and they received the Holy Ghost.” ([Acts
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#016.md),
[17](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#017.md)<span
id="vi.xviii-p18.11"></span>.) For, to show that this was the case, and
that it was the Spirit of miracles they had not received, observe how,
having seen the result, Simon came and asked for this. “And when Simon
saw that through laying on of the Apostles’ hands the Holy Ghost was
given, he offered them money, saying, Give me also this power, that on
whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost.” ([Acts
8:18](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#018.md),
[19](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#019.md)<span
id="vi.xviii-p18.12"></span>.)

<span id="vi.xviii-p19"></span>“The <span
id="fr_412"></span>[413](#fn_412.md) persecution,” say you, “gained
strength.” True, but at that very time to men possessed before (by a
hostile power) it brought deliverance. For it planted the miracles like
a stronghold, in the heart of the enemy’s country.—Not even the death of
Stephen quenched their rage, nay, increased it rather: it scattered wide
the teachers, so that the greater became the discipleship.—“And there
was joy.” And yet there had been “great lamentation:” true; but mark
again the good—“Of a long time” was the malady, but this man brought
them deliverance.—And how came he to baptize Simon also? Just as Christ
chose Judas.—And “beholding the signs” which he did, forasmuch as the
others did not receive the (power of working) signs, he durst not ask
for it.—How was it then that they did not strike him dead, as they did
Ananias and Sapphira? Because even in the old times, he that gathered
sticks (on the sabbath-day) was put to death as a warning to others
(<span id="vi.xviii-p20.17"></span>[Num. xv.
32](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#032)<span id="vi.xviii-p20.18"></span>.md)
and in no other instance did any suffer the same fate. So too on the
present occasion, “Peter said to him, Thy money perish, because thou
hast imagined that the gift of God is to be purchased with
money.”—([Acts 8.20](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#020.md)<span
id="vi.xviii-p20.19"></span>.) Why had not these received the Holy
Ghost, when baptized? Either because Philip kept this honor for the
Apostles; or, because he had not this gift (to impart); or, he was one
of the Seven: which is rather to be said. Whence, I take it, this Philip
was one of the Apostles. <span id="fr_413"></span>[414](#fn_413.md) But
observe; those went not forth: it was Providentially ordered that these
should go forth and those be lacking, because of the Holy Ghost: for
they had received power to work miracles, but not also to impart the
Spirit to others: this was the prerogative of the Apostles. And observe
(how they sent) the chief ones: not any others, but Peter \[and
John <span id="fr_414"></span>[415](#fn_414.md) \]. “And when Simon,” it
says, “saw that through laying on of the Apostles’ hands the Holy Ghost
was given.” He would not have said, “And having seen,” <span
id="fr_415"></span>[416](#fn_415.md) unless there had been some sensible
manifestation. <span id="fr_416"></span>[417](#fn_416.md) “Then laid they
their hands on them,” etc. Just as Paul also did, when they spake with
tongues. ([Acts 19.6](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#006.md)<span
id="vi.xviii-p24.5"></span>.) Observe the execrable conduct of Simon.
“He offered money,” with what object? And yet he did not see Peter doing
this for money. And it was not of ignorance that he acted thus; it was
because he would tempt them, because he wished to get matter of
accusation against them. And therefore also Peter says, “Thou hast no
part nor lot in this matter, for thine heart is not right before God
“because thou hast thought,” etc. ([Acts
8.21](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#021.md)<span
id="vi.xviii-p24.6"></span>.) Once more he brings to light what was in
the thoughts, because Simon thought to escape detection. “Repent
therefore of this thy wickedness and pray God, if perhaps the thought of
thine heart may be forgiven thee. For I perceive the bond of inquity.
Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the Lord for me, that none of
these things which ye have spoken come upon me.” ([Acts
8.22-24](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#022.md)<span
id="vi.xviii-p24.7"></span>.) Even this <span
id="fr_417"></span>[418](#fn_417.md) he did only formally, as words of
course, when he ought to have wept and mourned as a penitent. “If
perchance it may be forgiven thee.” Not as though it would not have been
pardoned, had he wept, but this is the manner of the Prophet also, to
denounce absolutely, (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xviii-p25.11"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xviii-p25.12"></span>παγορεύειν</span>) and not to say, “Howbeit,
if thou do this, thy sin shall be forgiven,” but that in any wise the
punishment shall take effect.

<span id="vi.xviii-p26"></span>(*a*) “Therefore they that were scattered
abroad, went everywhere, preaching the word.” But <span
id="fr_418"></span>[419](#fn_418.md) I would have thee admire how even in a
season of calamity they neglected not the preaching. “Hearing and seeing
the miracles which he did.” (Recapitulation, [Acts
8.4-6](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#004.md)<span
id="vi.xviii-p27.15"></span>.) Just as in the case of Moses by contrast
(with the magicians) the miracles were evident miracles, so here also.
There was magic, and so these signs were manifest. (*b*) “For unclean
spirits came out of many that were possessed with them” ([Acts
8.7](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#007.md)<span
id="vi.xviii-p27.16"></span>); for this was a manifest miracle:—not as
the magicians did: for the other (Simon), it is likely, bound (men with
spells);—“and many,” it says, “that were palsied and lame were healed.”
There was no deceit here: for it needed but that they should walk and
work. “And to him they all gave heed, saying, This (man) is the Power of
God.” ([Acts 8.10](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#010.md)<span
id="vi.xviii-p27.17"></span>.) And that was fulfilled which was spoken
by Christ, “There shall come false Christs and false Prophets in My
name.”—([Matt. xxiv. 24](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#024.md)<span
id="vi.xviii-p27.18"></span>.) “And to him they had regard, because that
of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries.” ([Acts
8.11](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#011.md)<span
id="vi.xviii-p27.19"></span>.) (*a*) And yet there ought to have been
not one demoniac there, seeing that of a long time he had been
bewitching them with sorceries: but if there were many demoniacs, many
palsied, these pretences were not truth. But Philip here by his word
also won them over, discoursing concerning the kingdom of Christ. ([Acts
8.12](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#012.md)<span
id="vi.xviii-p27.20"></span>.) “And Simon,” it says, “being baptized,
continued with Philip ([Acts 8.13](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#013.md)<span
id="vi.xviii-p27.21"></span>): not for faith’s sake, but in order that
he might become such (as he). (*b*) But why did they not correct him
instantly? They were content with his condemning himself. For this too
belonged to their work of teaching (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xviii-p27.22"></span>τἥς διδασκαλίας</span>). But <span
id="fr_419"></span>[420](#fn_419.md) when he had not power to resist, he
plays the hypocrite, just as did the magicians, who said, “This is the
finger of God.” And indeed that he might not be driven away again,
therefore he “continued with Philip,” and did not part from him. “And
when the Apostles which were at Jerusalem,” etc. ([Acts
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#013.md),
[14](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#014)<span id="vi.xviii-p28.4"></span>..md)
See how many things are brought about by God’s Providence through the
death of Stephen! (*a*) “But they,” it says, “having come down, prayed
for them that they might receive the Holy Ghost: for as yet He was
fallen upon none of them. Then laid they their hands upon them, and they
received the Holy Ghost.” ([Acts
8.15-17](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#015.md)<span
id="vi.xviii-p28.5"></span>.) Seest thou that it was not to be done in
any ordinary manner, but it needed great power to give the Holy Ghost?
For it is not all one, to obtain remission of sins, and to receive such
a power. (*b*) By degrees it is, that those receive the gift. It was a
twofold sign: both the giving to those, and the not giving to this
man. <span id="fr_420"></span>[421](#fn_420.md) Whereas then this man
ought, on the contrary, to have asked to receive the Holy Ghost, he,
because he cared not for this, asks power to give It to others. And yet
those received not this power to give: but this man wished to be more
illustrious than Philip, he being among the disciples! (*a*) “He offered
them money.” ([Acts 8:18](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#018.md),
[19](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#019)<span id="vi.xviii-p29.3"></span>..md)
What? had he seen the others doing this? had he seen Philip? Did he
imagine they did not know with what mind he came to them? (*b*) “Thy
money with thee to perdition” ([Acts
8.20](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#020.md)<span
id="vi.xviii-p29.4"></span>): since thou hast not used it as it ought to
be used. These are not words of imprecation, but of chastisement. “To
thee,” he says, be it (to thee): being such. As if one should say, Let
it perish along with thy purpose. Hast thou so mean conceptions of the
gift of God, that thou hast imagined it to be altogether a thing of man?
It is not this. (*a*) Wherefore also Peter well calls the affair a gift:
“Thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.”
Dost thou observe how on all occasions they are clean from money? “For
thine heart is not right in the sight of God.” ([Acts
8.21](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#021.md)<span
id="vi.xviii-p29.5"></span>.) Dost thou see how he does all of malice?
To be simple, however, was the thing needed. (*b*) For had it been done
with simplicity, <span id="fr_421"></span>[422](#fn_421.md) he would have
even welcomed his willing mind. Seest thou that to have mean conceptions
of great things is to sin doubly? Accordingly, two things he bids him:
“Repent and pray, if haply the thought of thine heart may be forgiven
thee.” ([Acts 8.22](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#022.md)<span
id="vi.xviii-p30.12"></span>.) Seest thou it was a wicked thought he had
entertained? Therefore he says, “If haply it may be forgiven thee:”
because he knew him to be incorrigible. (*a*) “For I perceive that thou
art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity.” ([Acts
8.23](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#023.md)<span
id="vi.xviii-p30.13"></span>.) Words of exceeding wrath! But otherwise
he did not punish him: that faith may not thereafter be of compulsion;
that the matter may not seem to be carried ruthlessly; that he may
introduce the subject of repentance: or also, because it suffices for
correction to have convicted him, to have told him what was in his
heart, to have brought him to confess himself overcome (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xviii-p30.14"></span>ὅ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xviii-p30.15"></span>τι ἐ& 128·λω</span>).
For that he says, “Pray ye for me,” is a confession that he has done
wrong. Observe him, <span id="fr_422"></span>[423](#fn_422.md) what a
miscreant he is; when he was convicted, then he believed: when again he
was convicted, then he became humble. <span
id="fr_423"></span>[424](#fn_423.md) “Seeing <span
id="fr_424"></span>[425](#fn_424.md) his miracles,” \[“he was amazed,” and
came over.\] He thought to be able to escape detection: he thought the
thing was an art: but when he had not power to defeat (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xviii-p33.24"></span>ἑ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xviii-p33.25"></span>λεἵν</span>) the
Apostles, \* \* \*. (*b*) Again, he fears the multitude, and is afraid
to deny it; and yet he might have said, “I did not know: I did it in
simplicity: but he was struck with dismay first by the former
circumstance, that he was overcome (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xviii-p33.26"></span>ὅ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xviii-p33.27"></span>τι ἐ& 128·λω</span>), by the miracles and
secondly by this, that his thoughts are made manifest. Therefore he now
takes himself a long wayoff, to Rome, thinking the Apostle would not
soon come there.

<span id="vi.xviii-p34"></span>“And they, when they had testified, and
preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem. ([Acts
8.25](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#025.md)<span
id="vi.xviii-p34.1"></span>.) “Testified,” probably because of him
(Simon), that they may not be deceived; that thenceforth they may be
safe. “Having preached,” it says, “the word of the Lord, they returned
to Jerusalem.” Why do they go thither again where was the tyranny of the
bad, where were those most bent upon killing them? Just as generals do
in wars, they occupy that part of the scene of war which is most
distressed. “And preached the Gospel in many villages of the
Samaritans.” Observe them again, how they do not (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xviii-p34.2"></span>προηγουμένως</span>) of
set purpose come to Samaria, but driven by stress of persecution, just
as it was in the case of Christ; and how when the Apostles go thither,
it is to men now believers, no longer Samaritans. “But when the
Apostles,” it says, “which were at Jerusalem heard this, they sent unto
them Peter and John. Sent” them, again, to rid them of magic. And <span
id="fr_425"></span>[426](#fn_425) besides, (the Lord.md) had given them a
pattern at the time when the Samaritans believed. “And in many
villages,” it says, “of the Samaritans, they preached the Gospel.”
(<span id="vi.xviii-p35.3"></span>[John iv.
39](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#039)<span id="vi.xviii-p35.4"></span>..md)
Observe how actively employed even their journeys were, how they do
nothing without a purpose. <span id="fr_426"></span>[427](#fn_426.md)

<span id="vi.xviii-p37"></span>Such travels should we also make. And why
do I speak of travels? Many possess villages and lands, and give
themselves no concern, nor make any account of this. That baths may be
provided, their revenues increased, courts and buildings erected, for
this they take plenty of pains: but for the husbandry of souls, not so.
When you see thorns—answer me—you cut them up, you burn, you utterly
destroy them, to rid your land of the hurt thence arising. And seest
thou the laborers themselves overrun with thorns, and dost not cut them
up, and art thou not afraid of the Owner Who shall call thee to account?
For ought not each individual believer to build a Church, to get a
Teacher, to cooperate (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xviii-p37.1"></span>συναί· ρεσθαι</span>) (with him), to make
this above all his object, that all may be Christians? Say, how is it
likely thy laborer should be a Christian, when he sees thee so
regardless of his salvation? Thou canst not work miracles, and so
convert (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xviii-p37.2"></span>πεῖσαι</span>) him. By the means which are in
thy power, convert him; by kindness, by good offices, by gentleness, by
courting (<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xviii-p37.3"></span>κολακεί&
139·</span>) him, by all other means. Market-places, indeed, and baths,
the most do provide; but no Churches: nay, sooner everything than this!
Wherefore I beseech and implore, as a favor I entreat, yea as a law I
lay it down, that there be no estate to be seen destitute of a
Church. <span id="fr_427"></span>[428](#fn_427.md) Tell not me, There is
one hard by; there is one in the neighboring properties; the expense is
great, the income not great. If thou have anything to expend upon the
poor, expend it there: better there than here. Maintain a Teacher,
maintain a Deacon, and a sacerdotal body complete. As by a bride,
whether a wife whom thou takest, or a daughter whom thou givest in
marriage, <span id="fr_428"></span>[429](#fn_428.md) so act by the Church:
give her a dowry. So shall thy estate be filled with blessing. For what
shall not be there of all that is good? Is it a small thing, tell me,
that thy wine-press should be blessed; <span
id="fr_429"></span>[430](#fn_429.md) a small thing, tell me, that of thy
fruits God is the first to taste, and that the first fruits are there
(with Him)? And then even for the peace of the laboring people this is
profitable. Then as one whom they must respect, there will be the
presbyter among them and this will contribute to the security of the
estate. There will be constant prayers there through thee <span
id="fr_430"></span>[431](#fn_430) (*infra,* note 1, p. 119.md) hymns and
Communions through thee; the Oblation on each Lord’s Day. For only
consider what a praise it will be, that, whereas others have built
splendid tombs, to have it said hereafter: “Such a one built this,” thou
hast reared Churches! Bethink thee that even until the coming of Christ
thou shalt have thy reward, who hast reared up the altars of God.

<span id="vi.xviii-p42"></span>Suppose an Emperor had ordered thee to
build an house that he might lodge there, wouldest thou not have done
everything to please him? And here now it is palace of Christ, the
Church, the Church which thou buildest. Look not at the cost, but
calculate the profit. Thy people yonder cultivate thy field: cultivate
thou their souls: they bring to thee thy fruits, raise thou them to
heaven. He that makes the beginning is the cause of all the rest: and
thou wilt be the cause that the people are brought under Christian
teaching (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xviii-p42.1"></span>κατηχουμένων</span>) both there, and in the
neighboring estates. Your baths do but make the peasants less hardy,
your taverns give them a taste for luxury, and yet you provide these for
credit’s sake. Your markets and fairs, (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xviii-p42.2"></span>πανηγύρεις</span>) on the other hand,
promote <span id="fr_431"></span>[432](#fn_431.md) covetousness. But think
now what a thing it would be to see a presbyter, the moving picture of
Abraham, gray-headed, girded up, digging and working with his own hands?
What more pleasant than such a field! Their virtue thrives. No
intemperance there, nay, it is driven away: no drunkenness and
wantonness, nay, it is cast out: no vanity, nay, it is extinguished. All
benevolent tempers shine out the brighter through the simplicity of
manners. How pleasant to go forth and enter into the House of God, and
to know that one built it himself: to fling himself on his back in his
litter, and <span id="fr_432"></span>[433](#fn_432.md) after the bodily
benefit of his pleasant airing, be present both at the evening and the
morning hymns, have the priest as a guest at his table, in associating
with him enjoy his benediction, see others also coming thither! This is
a wall for his field, this its security. This is the field of which it
is said, “The smell of a full field which the Lord hath blessed.” (<span
id="vi.xviii-p44.29"></span>[Gen. xxvii.
27](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#027)<span id="vi.xviii-p44.30"></span>..md)
If, even without this, the country is pleasant, because it is so quiet,
so free from distraction of business, what will it not be when this is
added to it? The country with a Church is like the Paradise of God. No
clamor there, no turmoil, no enemies at variance, no heresies: there you
shall see all friends, holding the same doctrines in common. The very
quiet shall lead thee to higher views, and receiving thee thus prepared
by philosophy, the presbyter shall give thee an excellent cure. For
here, whatever we may speak, the noise of the market drives it all out:
but there, what thou shalt hear, thou wilt keep fixed in thy mind. Thou
wilt be quite another man in the country through him: and moreover to
the people there he will be director, he will watch over them both by
his presence and by his influence in forming their manners. And what, I
ask, would be the cost? Make for a beginning a small house (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xviii-p44.31"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xviii-p44.32"></span>ν τάξει ναοὕ</span>) to
serve as temple. Thy successor will build a porch, his successor will
make other additions, and the whole shall be put to thy account. Thou
givest little, and receivest the reward for the whole. At any rate, make
a beginning: lay a foundation. Exhort one another, vie one with another
in this matter. But now, where there is straw and grain and such like to
be stored, you make no difficulty of building: but for a place where the
fruits of souls may be gathered in, we bestow not a thought; and the
people are forced to go miles and miles, and to make long journeys, that
they may get to Church! Think, how good it is, when with all quietness
the priest presents himself in the Church, that he may draw near unto
God, and say prayers for the village, day by day, and for its owner!
Say, is it a small matter, that even in the Holy Oblations evermore thy
name is included in the prayers, and that for the village day by day
prayers are made unto God?—How greatly this profits thee for all else!
It chances <span id="fr_433"></span>[434](#fn_433) that certain (great.md)
persons dwell in the neighborhood, and have overseers: now to thee,
being poor, one of them will not deign even to pay a visit: but the
presbyter, it is likely, he will invite, and make him sit at his table.
How much good results from this! The village will in the first place be
free from all evil suspicion. None will charge it with murder, with
theft: none will suspect anything of the kind.—They have also another
comfort, if sickness befall, if death.—Then again the friendships formed
there by people as they go side by side (to and from the Church) are not
struck up at random and promiscuously: and the meetings there are far
more pleasant than those which take place in marts and fairs. The people
themselves also will be more respectable, because of their presbyter.
How is it you hear that Jerusalem was had in honor in the old times
above all other cities? Why was this? Because of the then prevailing
religion. Therefore it is that where God is honored, there is nothing
evil: as, on the contrary, where He is not honored, there is nothing
good. It will be great security both with God and with men. Only, I
beseech you, that ye be not remiss: only may you put your hand to this
work. For if he who brings out “the precious from the vile,” shall be
“as the mouth of God” (<span id="vi.xviii-p46.5"></span>[Jer. xv.
19](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#019)<span id="vi.xviii-p46.6"></span>.md);
he who benefits and recovers so many souls, both that now are and that
shall be even until the coming of Christ, what favor shall not that
person reap from God! Raise thou a garrison against the devil: for that
is what the Church is. Thence as from headquarters let the hands go
forth to work: first let the people hold them up for prayers, and then
go their way to work. So shall there be vigor of body; so shall the
tillage be abundant; so shall all evil be kept aloof. It is not possible
to represent in words the pleasure thence arising, until it be realized.
Look not to this, that it brings in no revenue: if <span
id="fr_434"></span>[435](#fn_434.md) thou do it at all in this spirit, then
do it not at all; if thou account not the revenue thou gettest thence
greater than from the whole estate beside; if thou be not thus affected,
then let it alone; if thou do not account this work to stand thee more
in stead than any work beside. What can be greater than this revenue,
the gathering in of souls into the threshing-floor which is in heaven!
Alas, that ye know not how much it is, to gain souls! Hear what Christ
says to Peter, “Feed My sheep.” (<span id="vi.xviii-p47.4"></span>[John
xxi. 15-17](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#015.md)<span
id="vi.xviii-p47.5"></span>.) If, seeing the emperor’s sheep, or herd of
horses, by reason of having no fold or stable, exposed to depredation,
thou wert to take them in hand, and build a fold or stables, or also
provide a shepherd or herdsman to take charge of them, what would not
the emperor do for thee in return? Now, thou gatherest the flock of
Christ, and puttest a shepherd over them, and thinkest thou it is no
great gain thou art earning? But, if for offending even one, a man shall
incur so great a punishment, how can he that saves so many, ever be
punished? What sin will he have thenceforth? for, though he have it,
does not this blot it out? From the punishment threatened to him that
offends, learn the reward of him that saves. Were not the salvation of
even one soul a matter of great importance, to offend would not move God
to so great anger. Knowing these things, let us apply ourselves
forthwith to this spiritual work. And let each invite me, and we will
together help to the best of our ability. If there be three
joint-owners, let them do it by each bearing his part: if but one, he
will induce the others also that are near. Only be earnest to effect
this, I beseech you, that in every way being well-pleasing unto God, we
may attain unto the eternal blessings, by the grace and mercy of our
Lord Jesus Christ with Whom to the Father and the Holy Ghost together be
glory, dominion, and honor, now and ever world without end. Amen.

<span id="vi.xviii-p5"></span> In our <span class="c14"><span

is left unanswered, till some way further on. See note 2.—Montf. notes,
“Unus, <span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xviii-p5.6"></span>εἰστὸ μὴ

class="c14"><span id="vi.xviii-p5.7"></span>mss.</span> though the
Catena has it. Edd. from E, have; “How it was that they did not take
occasion from what he had said to kill him, but are still mad, and seek
an accusation, one may well wonder. So ever in trouble are the
wrong-doers. Just then as the chief priests, in their perplexity, said,”
etc. F. D. adopting part of this addition, “but are still mad, and seek
an accusation. See once more,” etc.

ἀνελεῖν· ἀλλ᾽ οὐ ποιοῦσι τοῦτο, αἰτίαν θέλοντες εὔλογον κ. τ.
λ</span>.—Œcumenius, however, begins his comment thus: <span

οὐκ ἀνεῖλον εὐθέως τότε</span><span class="Greek"><span

id="vi.xviii-p6.14"></span>Οτι πρόφασιν εὔλογον κ. τ. λ</span>. Hence we
restore the true reading, and the proper order. Namely, for <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xviii-p6.15"></span>Καὶ</span> we read <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xviii-p6.16"></span>Εἰ</span>, and transpose
to this place, as part of the interlocution, the question <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xviii-p6.17"></span>πῶς οὐκ ἔλαβον</span>—;
So, the <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xviii-p6.18"></span>φησίν</span> is explained, the question is
followed by its answer, and there is no abruptness.

<span id="vi.xviii-p7"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xviii-p7.1"></span>τοῦτο δὲ εὐσεβείας ἦν τὸ ῥ& 210·μα</span>.
i.e. all that Stephen had spoken in accusation of their wickedness,
especially [Acts 7.51-53](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#051.md)<span
id="vi.xviii-p7.2"></span>, was the language of piety, of a devout man
zealous for the honor of God: they could not say, “This is impious;” and
they were waiting to catch at something which might enable them to cry
out, “He blasphemeth:” and, disappointed of this, they were cut to the
heart.—Below Ben. retains (from E. alone) <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xviii-p7.3"></span>μὴ πάλιν καινόν τι περὶ αὐτὸν ἄλλο
γένηται</span>, though Savile had restored the genuine reading <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xviii-p7.4"></span>μὴ πάλιν αἰδεσιμώτερος
γένηται</span>. They had desired to injure his reputation for sanctity,
and now feared that his speech would have the opposite result.

<span id="vi.xviii-p8"></span> Edd. from E. <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xviii-p8.1"></span>οὕτω δὲ αὐτῷ λέγει φανῆναι, ὥς που διέξεισιν,
ἵνα κἂν οὕτω δέξωνται τὸν λόγον</span>. “And Stephen describes Christ as
appearing to Him in this manner, as one somewhere relates at large, in
order that,” etc.: meaning, that he might have said “sitting at the
right hand,” but forbears to do this, because it was offensive to the
Jews, and accordingly <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xviii-p8.2"></span>τέως περὶ τῆς ἀναστάσεως κινεῖ λόγον, καί

id="vi.xviii-p8.4"></span>ς</span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xviii-p8.5"></span>που διέξεισιν</span> seems to have been
intended by the innovator, not as part of the text, but as a gloss, “as
is somewhere shown at large.” But what Chrys. says is, that Christ was
pleased to appear in this attitude to Stephen for the sake of the Jews,
in order, etc.—Hom. vi. *in Ascens.* (Cat. in 1,) he says, “Why
standing, and not sitting? To show that He is in act to succor His
martyr. For thus it is said also of the Father, ‘Stand up, O God, and,
Now will I stand up, saith the Lord, I will set him in safety.’”—Below,
<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xviii-p8.6"></span>Διὰ τοῦτο κ. τ.
λ</span>. Comp. de Mundi Creat. Hom. ii. t. vi. 447. C. “Why did He
cause the face of Stephen to shine? Because he was to be stoned as a
blasphemer for saying ‘Behold,’ etc., therefore God, forestalling this,
crowned his face with angelic beauty, to show those thankless ones, that
if he were a blasphemer, he would not have been thus glorified.” But E.
(Edd.) <span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xviii-p8.7"></span>ἀ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xviii-p8.8"></span>πὸ τούτου στοχάζομαι

this time: Ben. hence) that his face was glorified.” In the next
sentence, Edd. from E. <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xviii-p8.9"></span>δἰ ὧν ἐπεβουλεύοντο ἐκεῖνοι, δἰ αὐτῶν ἐβούλετο
αὐτούς ἐκκαλέσασθαι, εἰ καὶ μηδὲν πλέον ἐγένετο. Καὶ ἐκβαλόντες κ. τ.

<span id="vi.xviii-p13"></span> Chrys. seems to assume that <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xviii-p13.1"></span>ἄ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xviii-p13.2"></span>νδρες εὐλαβεῖς</span>
refers to Christian men, a view that has been taken by some modern
expositors (as Ewald and DeWette). It is better to understand by the
term, pious Jews who were favorably disposed to Christianity (So Meyer,
Olshausen, Lechler, Lange, Gloag, Hackett). The usage of <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xviii-p13.3"></span>εύλαβής</span> in the
N.T. favors this view as it is applied to devout persons who were not
Christians (vid. [Acts 2:5](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#005.md), [Luke
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#025)<span id="vi.xviii-p13.4"></span>.md)
in every case, except in [Acts
22.12](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#012.md)<span
id="vi.xviii-p13.5"></span>when it refers to Ananias, a Christian, but
is used in describing him in a legal point of view: <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xviii-p13.6"></span>εὐλαβὴς κατὰ τὸν
νόμον</span>. Moreover, if Christians had been meant, they would not
probably have been designated by so vague a term, but, as uniformly,
would have been called *disciples* or *brethren.* The burial of Stephen
by devout Jews recalls the burial of Jesus by Joseph of Arimathæa and
Nicodemus ([John 19:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#038.md),

<span id="vi.xviii-p16"></span> Ben. after Morel. from E. without notice
of the true reading (A. B. C. N. Cat.), received by Savile, has: <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xviii-p16.1"></span>῞</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xviii-p16.2"></span>Οθεν θεῖος αὐτοῦ καὶ ὁ
θάνατος γέγονε. Μεχρὶ γὰρ τούτου συγκεχώρητο ταῖς ψυχαῖς ἐν τῷ ἅδῃ
εἶναι</span>. (The latter part is adopted also by D. F.) “Whence also
his death became divine. For until this time it had been granted to the
souls to be in Hades.” This comment is derived from St. Cyril. Al. from
whom the Catena cites: “Since we are justified by faith in Him.…He hath
wrought a new thing for us, <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xviii-p16.3"></span>τὸ μηκέτι μὲν εἰς ᾅδου τρέχειν τὰς τῶν
σωμάτων ἀπαλλαττομένας ψυχὰς καθὰ καὶ πρωὴν, πέμπεσθαι δὲ μᾶλλον εἰς
χεῖρας Θεοῦ ζῶντος</span>: that our souls, on their deliverance from our
bodies, no longer as aforetime haste into Hades, but are conveyed into
the hands of the Living God. And knowing this, Saint Stephen said, “Lord
Jesus receive my spirit.” Œcumen, repeats this, almost in the same
words.

<span id="vi.xviii-p20"></span> The modern text E. F. D. Edd. “But
although the persecution then most gained strength, nevertheless God
again delivered them, <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xviii-p20.1"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xviii-p20.2"></span>πιτείχισας αὐτοῖς τὰ σημεῖα</span>. Stephen’s
death, however, did not quench their rage, nay, increased it rather,
wherefore also the teachers, etc. But observe again how good things take
their turn with them, and how they are in joy. ‘For there was great
joy,’ it says, ‘in that city.’ And yet there had also been ‘great
lamentation.’ Thus is God ever wont to do, and to temper things grievous
with things joyful, that He may be more held in admiration. But of a
long time had this disease been upon Simon; wherefore not even thus is
he rid of it.” But in the genuine text, (A. B. C. N. Cat. ad. v. 15–17,
and 3, 4.) the subject to <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xviii-p20.3"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xviii-p20.4"></span>ξείλετο</span> and <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xviii-p20.5"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span

class="Greek"><span id="vi.xviii-p20.7"></span>Θεὸς</span>, but <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xviii-p20.8"></span>διωγμὸς</span>: and the
persons delivered are not the disciples, but the Samaritans, described
as <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xviii-p20.9"></span>προκατεχόμενοι</span>, viz. under the
influence of Simon’s sorceries. In the last sentence, the meaning is
entirely mistaken: for the <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xviii-p20.10"></span>νόσημα</span> is the infatuation of the
Samaritans, not the wickedness of Simon.—<span class="Greek"><span

id="vi.xviii-p20.12"></span>Επετείχισε γὰρ αὐτοῖς τὰ σημεῖα</span> can

id="vi.xviii-p20.20"></span>

<span id="vi.xviii-p21"></span> So A. B. C. N. Cat. Of the Edd., Savile
alone retains this clause, the rest follow the mod. text, which rejects
it. And indeed it can hardly be doubted, that St. Chrys. himself would
have expunged, or altered this statement, had he revised these Homilies:
for in the next Hom. he shows that the Philip of [Acts
8.26-40](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#026.md)<span
id="vi.xviii-p21.1"></span> was certainly not the Apostle, but probably
one of the seven deacons. The fact seems to be, that having had no
occasion until now to discuss this question, he had assumed (as others
had done before him) that the Philip of the Eunuch’s history was the
Apostle of that name: thus in *Hom. ad Gen.* xxxv. §2 (delivered but a
few years before), he takes this for granted. Here, however, he
perceives that the Philip who preached at Samaria could not be the
Apostle: but at present he is still under the impression, that the
person by whom the Eunuch was converted was St. Philip the Apostle, and
accordingly speaks as in the text, “This Philip, I take it, was one of
the Seven; he of the story of the Eunuch was one of the Apostles.” Of
course it was impossible on a review of the circumstances to rest in
this conclusion; and in the very beginning of the next Homily he tacitly
revokes the notion here advanced, and points out how the command,
“Arise, and go to the south,” must have been addressed to Philip in
Samaria (the deacon), and not Philip the Apostle in Jerusalem. (See the
note there.) The early writers frequently confound the Philip of this
chapter (the deacon and evangelist, <span
id="vi.xviii-p21.2"></span>[Acts xxi.
9](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#009.md)<span id="vi.xviii-p21.3"></span>,

to a correspondent who was not satisfied with his statement (Ep.
447<span id="vi.xviii-p21.5"></span>), that “Philip who baptized the
Eunuch and catechized Simon was not the Apostle, but one of the Seven,”
and requested proof from Scripture (<span class="Greek"><span

him observe, ch. viii. 1. that the Apostles remained at Jerusalem: that
Philip the Apostle would have been competent to impart the gift of the
Spirit: and further suggests, that Philip the deacon, fleeing from the
persecution, was on his way through Samaria to Cæsarea his native place,
(where we afterwards find him [Acts
21.9](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#009.md)<span
id="vi.xviii-p21.10"></span>), when these events befell, viz. the
preaching, etc., at Samaria, and the conversion of the Eunuch.—In the
next sentence, <span class="Greek"><span

id="vi.xviii-p21.12"></span>κεῖνοι</span> (i.e. the Apostles) <span

id="vi.xviii-p21.18"></span>καὶ ἐκείνους ἑτέρως</span>, “and those (the
Apostles) otherwise.”—The modern text, after “next to Stephen,” proceeds
thus: “Wherefore also, when baptizing, he did not impart the Spirit to
the baptized, for neither had he authority to do so, since the gift
belonged only to the Twelve. But observe; those went not forth; it was
Providentially ordered that these should go forth, <span

([Acts 8.16](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#016.md)<span

any of the Samaritans, that the ordinary influences of the Spirit which

miraculous endowments such as the gift of tongues, and of prophecy and
perhaps of miracles were meant.—G.B.S.

<span id="vi.xviii-p27"></span> What follows, to the end of the
Exposition, has by some accident fallen into strange confusion. In the
Translation we have endeavored to restore the proper order. In the first
place it should be observed, that the portion beginning <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xviii-p27.1"></span>Οἱ μὲν

class="Greek"><span id="vi.xviii-p27.3"></span>τε πρῶτον

interchanged with the portion of about 25 lines, beginning <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xviii-p27.4"></span>Δεὸν οὖν τοῦτον</span>,
and ending <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xviii-p27.5"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xviii-p27.6"></span>κεῖ τοῦ ἀποστόλου</span>, p 149, C. These
being restored to their proper order, which is evident from the contents
of the two portions, we have, to the end of the Recapitulation, two
portions, dividing at <span class="Greek"><span

id="vi.xviii-p27.13"></span>. These, it may be supposed, are two several
and successive expositions. But it will be seen on comparing them, that
each in itself is often abrupt and incomplete, and that their parts fit
into each other in a way which can hardly be accidental. It may also be
remarked, that the length of each is the same; each containing about 46
lines. We have marked the order of the <span class="c14"><span

Perhaps the passage may be restored somewhat thus: “Seeing his miracles,
he was amazed, and came over.” He thought to escape detection, he
thought the thing was an art: but when he had not power to resist, he
plays the hypocrite, as the magicians did, who said, “This is the finger

by laying on of hands etc.; again he thought it was an art, he thought

Apostles (as it was said above, “he wished to get matter of accusation

<span id="vi.xviii-p36"></span> The preaching of Philip in Samaria was
the first Gentile mission, for the Samaritans were a mixed people and
were regarded as heathen by the Jews. An interesting concatenation of
events took its rise in the bold preaching of Stephen. On the one side
there proceeded from this the increased opposition of the Jewish nation
and the sad calamity of the preacher’s own death, but on the other there
flowed from this opposition and the persecution which was consequent
upon it great benefit. The Christians were indeed scattered abroad by
ill-treatment, but with them went the gospel message, and the great work
of heathen missions dated directly back to the martyrdom of Stephen.
Christian history furnishes no more impressive illustration of the
saying of Tertullian: “The blood of martyrs is seed.”—G.B.S.

<span id="vi.xviii-p38"></span> In St. Chrysostom’s time, little had
been done for the conversion and instruction of the peasantry: hence in
the latter half of the fourth century *paganus* came to be as synonymous
with “heathen.” Even Christian proprietors neglected their duty in this
regard, while they improved their properties, and swelled their revenues
by great oppression of their tenants and laborers: see *Hom. in Matt.*
xliii., lxi. and at the same time connived at the practice of the old
idolatries, for the sake of the dues accruing to them from the temples
which still remained. Thus Zeno of Verona, *Serm.* xv. p. 120,
complains: *In prædiis vestris fumantia undique sola fana non nostis,
quæ, si vera dicenda sunt, dissimulanda subtiliter custoditis. Jus
templorum ne quis vobis eripiat, quotidie litigatis.* The Christianity
which was outwardly professed in the country parts was often for want of
Churches and Clergy little more than nominal: and the heathen orator
Libanius, in his *Oratio pro Templis,* addressed to the Emperor
Theodosius, perhaps did not greatly exaggerate in the following
part (viz. the destruction of the Temples and suppression of the
sacrifices) many are become Christians, you must not forget to
distinguish between show and reality. They are not a whit changed from
what they were before: they only say they are so. They resort indeed to
public acts of religion, and mingle themselves with the general body of
Christians. But when they have a show of praying, they invoke either
none or the Gods.”—Moreover, the country clergy were often themselves
ill-taught and needing instruction. Thus *Hom. in Col.* (t. xi. p. 392)
delivered at Constantinople, Chrys. says: “How much instruction is
needed by your brethren in the country, and by their teachers (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xviii-p38.1"></span>καὶ τοὺς ἐκείνων
διδασκάλους</span>)!” Which perhaps was the result of a law passed <span
class="c14"><span id="vi.xviii-p38.2"></span>a.d.</span> 398, *Cod.
Theodos.* xvi. tit. 2 l. 33 which enacted, that the clergy for the
Churches founded on states, or in villages, should be from no other
state or village, but that to which the Church pertained: and of these a
certain number, at the discretion of the bishop, according to the extent
of the village, etc.—On the other hand, Chrys. “on the Statues,” Or,
xix. t. ii. p. 189 dwells with much delight on the virtues and
patriarchal simplicity of the rural clergy in Syria, and the Christian
attainments of their people.

this peculiar usage is mentioned, that a handful of ears of corn in the

spoken over them, and so the whole field was considered as blessed.

pleasant and healthful for the body.” The meaning is: “without fatigue,

after this wholesome enjoyment for the body, gets good for his soul, in
attending at evening and morning prayer. Ben. *seipsumque projicere

there. His overseer informs him of your Church: he sends for your
presbyter, invites him to his table, gains from him such information
about your village, as he would never have acquired otherwise; for he
thinks it beneath him even to call upon you. In this way, however, he
learns that yours is a well-ordered village: and should any crime be
committed in that part of the country by unknown persons no suspicion
even will light upon your people; no troublesome inquisition will be
held, no fine or penalty levied on your estate.” The v. 1. <span
