<span id="vi.xxxiii-p1"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vi.xxxiii-p1.1"></span>Homily XXXIII.</span>

<span id="vi.xxxiii-p2"></span>[Acts
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#013.md),
[15](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#015.md)<span id="vi.xxxiii-p2.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xxxiii-p3"></span>“And after they had held their peace,
James answered, saying, Men and brethren, hearken unto me: Symeon hath
declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles, to take out of
them a people for his name. And to this agree the words of the
prophets.”

<span id="vi.xxxiii-p4"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="vi.xxxiii-p4.1"></span>This</span> (James) was bishop, as they say,
and therefore he speaks last, and herein is fulfilled that saying, “In
the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established.”
(<span id="vi.xxxiii-p4.2"></span>[Deut. xvii.
6](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#006.md)<span id="vi.xxxiii-p4.3"></span>;
[Matt. xviii. 16](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#016.md)<span
id="vi.xxxiii-p4.4"></span>.) But observe the discretion shown by him
also, in making his argument good from the prophets, both new and
old. <span id="fr_751"></span>[752](#fn_751.md) For he had no acts of his
own to declare, as Peter had and Paul. And indeed it is wisely ordered
that this (the active) part is assigned to those, as not intended to be
locally fixed in Jerusalem, whereas (James) here, who performs the part
of teacher, is no way responsible for what has been done, while however
he is not divided from them in opinion. <span
id="fr_752"></span>[753](#fn_752) (*b*.md) “Men and brethren,” he says,
“hearken unto me.” Great is the moderation of the man. His also is a
more complete oration, as indeed it puts the completion to the matter
under discussion. (*a*) “Symeon,” he says, “declared:” (namely,) in
Luke, in that he prophesied, “Which Thou hast prepared before the face
of all nations, a light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of Thy
people Israel.” <span id="fr_753"></span>[754](#fn_753) (*c*.md) “How God
at the first did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for
His Name.” (<span id="vi.xxxiii-p7.12"></span>[Luke ii.
25](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#025)<span id="vi.xxxiii-p7.13"></span>..md)
Then, since that (witness), though <span
id="fr_754"></span>[755](#fn_754.md) from the time indeed he was manifest,
yet had not authority by reason of his not being ancient, therefore he
produces ancient prophecy also, saying, “And to this agree the words of
the Prophets, as it is written: After this I wilt return, and will build
again the tabernacle of David which is fallen down; and I will build
again the ruins thereof, and I will set it up.” ([Acts
15.16](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#016.md)<span
id="vi.xxxiii-p8.6"></span>.) What? was Jerusalem raised up? Was it not
rather thrown down? What <span id="fr_755"></span>[756](#fn_755.md) sort of
raising up does he call that which took place after the return from
Babylon? “That the residue of men,” he says, “may seek the Lord, even
all the Gentiles upon whom My Name is called.” ([Acts
15.17](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#017.md)<span
id="vi.xxxiii-p9.2"></span>.) Then, what makes his word
authoritative—“Saith the Lord, which doeth all these things:” and, for
that this is no new thing, but all was planned from the beginning,
“Known unto God are all His works from everlasting.” <span
id="fr_756"></span>[757](#fn_756.md) ([Acts
15.18](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#018.md)<span
id="vi.xxxiii-p10.7"></span>.) And then again his authority (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxiii-p10.8"></span>καὶ τὸ ἀξίωμα
πάλιν</span>) (as Bishop): “Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble
not them, which from among the Gentiles are turned to God: but that we
write unto them, that they abstain from pollution of idols, and from
fornication, and from things strangled, and from blood. For Moses of old
time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the
synagogues every sabbath day.” ([Acts
15.19-21](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#019.md)<span
id="vi.xxxiii-p10.9"></span>.) Since <span
id="fr_757"></span>[758](#fn_757.md) then they had heard of the Law, with
good reason he enjoins these things from the Law, that he may not seem
to make it of no authority. And (yet) observe how he does not let them
be told these things from the Law, but from himself, saying, It is not
that I heard these things from the Law, but how? “We have judged.” Then
the decree is made in common. “Then pleased it the Apostles and elders,
together with the whole Church, to choose men of their own company”—do
you observe they do not merely enact these matters, and nothing
more?—“and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas: namely, Judas
surnamed Barsabas, and Silas, chief men among the brethren: and they
wrote letters by them after this manner.” ([Acts
15.22](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#022.md)<span
id="vi.xxxiii-p11.10"></span>.) And observe, the more to authenticate
the decree, they send men of their own, that there may be no room for
regarding Paul and his company with suspicion. “The Apostles and elders
and brethren send greeting unto the brethren which are of the Gentiles
in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia.” ([Acts
15.23](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#023.md)<span
id="vi.xxxiii-p11.11"></span>.) And mark <span
id="fr_758"></span>[759](#fn_758.md) with what forbearance of all harsh
vituperation of those (brethren) they indite their epistle. “Forasmuch
as we have heard, that certain which went out from us have troubled you
with words, subverting your souls, saying, Ye must be circumcised, and
keep the Law: to whom we gave no such commandment.” ([Acts
15.24](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#024.md)<span
id="vi.xxxiii-p12.6"></span>.) Sufficient was this charge against the
temerity of those men, and worthy of the Apostles’ moderation, that they
said nothing beyond this. Then to show that they do not act
despotically, that all are agreed in this, that with deliberation they
write this—“It seemed good to us, being assembled with one accord, to
send men of ours whom we have chosen” ([Acts
15.25](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#025.md)<span
id="vi.xxxiii-p12.7"></span>)—then, that it may not look like
disparagement of Paul and Barnabas, that those men are sent, observe the
encomium passed upon them—“together with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,
men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus
Christ. We have sent therefore Judas and Silas; who shall also tell you
the same things by mouth. For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to
us”—it is not man’s doing, it says—“to lay upon you no greater
burden”—again it calls the Law a burden: then apologizing even for these
injunctions—“save these necessary things” ([Acts
15.26-28](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#026.md)<span
id="vi.xxxiii-p12.8"></span>): "That ye abstain from meats offered to
idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication
from which if ye keep yourselves, ye shall do well. ([Acts
15.29](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#029.md)<span
id="vi.xxxiii-p12.9"></span>.) For these things the New Testament did
not enjoin: we nowhere find that Christ discoursed about these matters;
but these things they take from the Law. “From things strangled,” it
says, “and from blood.” Here it prohibits murder. (Comp. [Gen. ix.
5](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#005)<span id="vi.xxxiii-p12.10"></span>..md)
“So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch: and when they had
gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle: which when
they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation.” ([Acts
15:30](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#030.md),
[31](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#031.md)<span
id="vi.xxxiii-p12.11"></span>.) Then those (brethren) also exhorted
them: and having established them, for towards Paul they were
contentiously disposed, so departed from them in peace. “And Judas and
Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted the brethren with many
words, and confirmed them. And after they had tarried there a space,
they were let go in peace from the brethren unto the Apostles.” ([Acts
15:32](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#032.md),
[33](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#033.md)<span
id="vi.xxxiii-p12.12"></span>.) No more factions and fightings, but
thenceforth Paul taught. <span id="fr_759"></span>[760](#fn_759.md)

<span id="vi.xxxiii-p14"></span>(Recapitulation.) “Then all the
multitude kept silence,” etc. ([Acts
15.12](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#012.md)<span
id="vi.xxxiii-p14.1"></span>.) There was no arrogance in the Church.
After Peter Paul speaks, and none silences him: James waits patiently,
not starts up <span id="fr_760"></span>[761](#fn_760.md) (for the next
word). Great the orderliness (of the proceedings). No word speaks John
here, no word the other Apostles, but held their peace, for James was
invested with the chief rule, and think it no hardship. So clean was
their soul from love of glory. “And after that they had held their
peace, James answered,” etc. ([Acts
15.13](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#013.md)<span
id="vi.xxxiii-p15.7"></span>.) (*b*) Peter indeed spoke more strongly,
but James here more mildly: for thus it behooves one in high authority,
to leave what is unpleasant for others to say, while he himself appears
in the milder part. (*a*) But what means it, “How God first (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxiii-p15.8"></span>πρὥτον</span>) did
visit?” ([Acts 15.14](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#014.md)<span
id="vi.xxxiii-p15.9"></span>.) (It means) from the beginning (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxiii-p15.10"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxiii-p15.11"></span>ξ ἀρχἥς</span>). <span
id="fr_761"></span>[762](#fn_761) (*c*.md) Moreover he well says, “Symeon
expounded” (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxiii-p16.7"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxiii-p16.8"></span>ξηγήσατο</span>) (or, interpreted), implying
that he too spake the mind of others. “And to this agree,” etc. Observe
how he shows that this is a doctrine of old time. “To take out of the
Gentiles,” he says, “a people for His Name.” ([Acts
15.15](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#015.md)<span
id="vi.xxxiii-p16.9"></span>.) Not simply, Chose, but, “for His Name,”
that is for His glory. His Name is not shamed by the taking (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxiii-p16.10"></span>προλήψει</span>) the
Gentiles first, but it is even a greater glory.—Here some even great
thing is hinted at: that these are chosen before all. <span
id="fr_762"></span>[763](#fn_762.md) “After this I will return, and rebuild
the tabernacle of David which is fallen down.” ([Acts
15.16](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#016.md)<span
id="vi.xxxiii-p17.11"></span>.) But if one would look into the matter
closely, the kingdom of David does in fact now stand, his Offspring
reigning everywhere. For what is the good of the buildings and the city,
with none obeying there? And what is the harm arising from the
destruction of the city, when all are willing to give their very souls?
There is that come which is more illustrious than David: in all parts of
the world is he now sung. This has come to pass: if so, then must this
also come to pass, “And I will build again the ruins thereof, and I will
set it up:” to what end? “that the residue of men may seek the Lord, and
all the Gentiles, upon whom My Name is called.” ([Acts
15.17](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#017.md)<span
id="vi.xxxiii-p17.12"></span>.) If then it was to this end that the city
rose again (namely) because of Him (that was to come) of them, it shows
that of the building of the city the cause is, the calling of the
Gentiles. Who are “the residue?” those who are then left. <span
id="fr_763"></span>[764](#fn_763.md) “And all the Gentiles, upon whom My
Name is called:” but observe, how he keeps the due order, and brings
them in second. “Saith the Lord, which doeth these things.” Not “saith”
(only), but “doeth.” Why then, it was God’s work.—“But the question is
other than this (namely), what Peter spoke more plainly, whether they
must be circumcised. Then why dost thou harangue about these matters?”
For what the objectors asserted, was not that they must not be received
upon believing, but that it must be with the Law. And upon this Peter
well pleaded: but then, as this very thing above all others troubled the
hearers, therefore he sets this to rights again (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxiii-p18.2"></span>θεραπεύει</span>). And
observe, that which was needful to be enacted as a rule, that it is not
necessary to keep the Law, this Peter introduced: but the milder
part, <span id="fr_764"></span>[765](#fn_764.md) the truth which was
received of old, this James saith, and dwells upon that concerning which
nothing is <span id="fr_765"></span>[766](#fn_765.md) written, in order
that having soothed their minds by that which is acknowledged, he may
opportunely introduce this likewise. “Wherefore,” saith he, “my sentence
is, not to trouble them which from among the Gentiles do turn unto God”
([Acts 15.19](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#019.md)<span
id="vi.xxxiii-p20.5"></span>), that is, not to subvert: for, if God
called them, and these observances subvert, we fight against God.
And <span id="fr_766"></span>[767](#fn_766.md) again, “them which from the
Gentiles,” he saith, “do turn.” And he says well, with authority, the
“*my* sentence is. But that we write unto them that they abstain from
pollutions of idols, and from fornication”—(*b*) and yet they often
insisted upon these points in discoursing to them <span
id="fr_767"></span>[768](#fn_767.md) —but, that he may seem also to honor
the Law (he mentions), these also, speaking (however) not as from Moses
but from the Apostles, and to make the commandments many, he has divided
the one into two (saying), “and from things strangled, and from blood.”
([Acts 15.20](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#020.md)<span
id="vi.xxxiii-p22.11"></span>.) For these, although relating to the
body, were necessary to be observed, because (these things) caused great
evils, “For Moses hath of old times in every city,” etc. ([Acts
15.21](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#021.md)<span
id="vi.xxxiii-p22.12"></span>.) This above all quieted them. (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxiii-p22.13"></span>ἀ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxiii-p22.14"></span>νέπαυσεν</span>) (*a*)
For this cause I affirm that it is good (so “to write to them.”) Then
why do we not write the same injunctions to Jews also? Moses discourses
unto them. See what condescension (to their weakness)! Where it did no
harm, he set him up as teacher, and indulged them with a gratification
which hindered nothing, by permitting Jews to hear him in regard of
these matters, even while leading away from him them of the Gentiles.
See what wisdom! He seems to honor him, and to set him up as the
authority for his own people, and by this very thing he leads away the
Gentiles from him! <span id="fr_768"></span>[769](#fn_768.md) “Being read
in the synagogues every sabbath day.” Then why do they not learn (what
is to be learnt) out of him, for instance \* \*? <span
id="fr_769"></span>[770](#fn_769.md) Through the perversity of these men.
He shows that even these (the Jews) need observe no more (than these
necessary things). And if we do not write to them, it is not that they
are bound to observe anything more, but only that they have one to tell
them. And he does not say, Not to offend, nor to turn them back, <span
id="fr_770"></span>[771](#fn_770.md) which is what Paul said to the
Galatians, but, “not to trouble them:” he shows that the point (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxiii-p25.5"></span>κατόρθωμα</span>) if
carried is nothing but a mere troubling. Thus he made an end of the
whole matter; <span id="fr_771"></span>[772](#fn_771.md) and while he seems
to preserve the Law by adopting these rules from it, he unbinds it by
taking only these. (*c*) <span id="fr_772"></span>[773](#fn_772.md) There
was a design of Providence in the disputation also, that after the
disputation the doctrine might be more firm. “Then pleased it the
Apostles to send chosen men of their own company,” etc., no ordinary
persons, but the “leading men; having written” (letters) “by them after
this manner. To those in Antioch,” it says, “and Syria and Cilicia.”
([Acts 15:22](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#022.md),
[23](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#023)<span id="vi.xxxiii-p27.2"></span>.md)
where the disease had its birth. Observe how they say nothing harsher
(<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxiii-p27.3"></span>φορτικώτερον</span>) against those men, but
look to one thing only, namely, to undo (the mischief) which has been
done. For this would make even the movers of the faction there to
confess (that they were wrong). They do not say, The seducers, the
pestilent fellows, or suchlike: though where need is, Paul does this, as
when he says, “O full of all guile” ([Acts
13.10](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#010.md)<span
id="vi.xxxiii-p27.4"></span>): but here, the point being carried, there
was no need. And observe, they do not put it, That certain from us
ordered you to keep the Law, but, “Troubled you with words, subverting
your souls,”—nothing could be more proper (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxiii-p27.5"></span>κυριώτερον</span>) than that word: none (of
the other speakers) has so spoken of the things done by those men. “The
souls,” he says, already strongly established, these persons are <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxiii-p27.6"></span>ἀ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxiii-p27.7"></span>νασχευάζοντες</span> as
in speaking of a building, “taking them down again:” displacing them
(<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxiii-p27.8"></span>μετατιθέντες</span>) from the
foundation). <span id="fr_773"></span>[774](#fn_773.md) “To whom,” he says,
“we gave no such commandment. It seemed good therefore to us being
assembled with one accord, to send chosen men unto you together with our
beloved Barnabas and Paul, men that have hazarded their lives for the
Name of our Lord Jesus Christ.” ([Acts
15:25](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#025.md),
[26](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#026.md)<span
id="vi.xxxiii-p28.9"></span>.) If “beloved,” they will not despise them,
if they “have hazarded their lives,” they have themselves a right to be
believed. “We have sent,” it saith, “Judas and Silas, who shall also
tell you the same things by word of mouth.” ([Acts
15.27](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#027.md)<span
id="vi.xxxiii-p28.10"></span>.) For it was necessary that there should
be not merely the Epistle there by itself, lest they should say that
Paul and Barnabas had suppressed <span id="fr_774"></span>[775](#fn_774.md)
(the real purport), that they said one thing instead of another. The
encomium passed upon Paul stopped their mouths. For this is the reason
why neither Paul comes alone nor Barnabas (with him), but others also
from the Church; that he may not be suspected, seeing it was he that
advocated that doctrine: nor yet those from Jerusalem alone. It shows
that they have a right to be believed. “For it seemed good,” say they,
“to the Holy Ghost and to us” ([Acts
15.28](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#028.md)<span
id="vi.xxxiii-p29.8"></span>): not making themselves equal (to Him <span
id="fr_775"></span>[776](#fn_775) .md)—they are not so mad. But why does it
put this (so)? Why did they add, “And to us,” and yet it had sufficed to
say, “To the Holy Ghost?” The one, “To the Holy Ghost,” that they may
not deem it to be of man; the other, “To us,” that they may be taught
that they also themselves admit (the Gentiles), although themselves
being in circumcision. They have to speak to men who are still weak and
afraid of them: this is the reason why this also is added. And it shows
that it is not by way of condescension that they speak, neither because
they spared them, nor as considering them weak, but the contrary; for
great was the reverence of the teachers also. <span
id="fr_776"></span>[777](#fn_776.md) “To lay upon you no greater
burden”—they <span id="fr_777"></span>[778](#fn_777.md) are ever calling it
a burden—and again, “save these necessary things:” for that was a
superfluous burden. See here a brief Epistle, with nothing more in it
(than was needed), neither arts of persuasion (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxiii-p32.7"></span>κατασκευὰς</span>) nor reasonings, but
simply a command: for it was the Spirit’s legislating. “So when they
were dismissed they came to Antioch, and having gathered the multitude
together, they delivered to them the epistle.” ([Acts
15.30](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#030.md)<span
id="vi.xxxiii-p32.8"></span>.) After the epistle, then (Judas and Silas)
also themselves exhort them by word ([Acts
15.31](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#031.md)<span
id="vi.xxxiii-p32.9"></span>): for this also was needful, that (Paul and
Barnabas) might be quit of all suspicion. “Being prophets also
themselves,” it says, exhorted the brethren “with many words.” It shows
here the right that Paul and Barnabas have to be believed. For Paul also
might have done this, but it behooved to be done by these. <span
id="fr_778"></span>[779](#fn_778.md) “And after they had tarried there a
space, they were let go in peace. ([Acts
15.33](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#033.md)<span
id="vi.xxxiii-p33.1"></span>.)

<span id="vi.xxxiii-p34"></span>No <span
id="fr_779"></span>[780](#fn_779.md) more faction. On this occasion, I
suppose, it was that they received the right hand, as he says himself,
“They gave to me and Barnabas right hands of fellowship.” ([Gal. ii.
9](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#009)<span id="vi.xxxiii-p35.7"></span>..md)
There he says, “They added nothing to me.” <span
id="fr_780"></span>[781](#fn_780.md) ([Gal.
2.6](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#006.md)<span
id="vi.xxxiii-p36.2"></span>.) For they confirmed his view: they praised
and admired it.—It shows that even from human reasonings it is possible
to see this, not to say from the Holy Ghost only, that they sinned a sin
not easy to be corrected. For such things need not the Spirit.—It shows
that the rest are not necessary, but superfluous, seeing these things
are necessary. “From which if ye keep yourselves,” it saith, “ye shall
do well.” It shows that nothing is lacking to them, but this is
sufficient. For it might have been done also without letters, but that
there may be a law in writing (they send this Epistle): again, that they
may obey the law (the Apostles), also told those men (the same things),
and they did this, “and confirmed them, and having tarried a space were
let go in peace.”

<span id="vi.xxxiii-p37"></span>Let us not then be offended on account
of the heretics. For look, here at the very outset of the preaching, how
many offences there were: I speak not of those which arose from them
that were without; for these were nothing: but of the offences which
were within. For instance, first Ananias, then the “murmuring,” then
Simon the sorcerer; afterwards they that accused Peter on account of
Cornelius, next the famine, <span id="fr_781"></span>[782](#fn_781.md)
lastly this very thing, the chief of the evils. For indeed it is
impossible when any good thing has taken place, that some evil should
not also subsist along with it. Let us not then be disturbed, if certain
are offended, but let us thank God even for this, because it makes us
more approved. For not tribulations only, but even temptations also
render us more illustrious. A man is no such great lover of the truth,
only for holding to it when there is none to lead him astray from it: to
hold fast to the truth when many are drawing him away, this makes the
proved man. What then? Is this why offences come? I am not speaking as
if God were the author of them: God forbid! but I mean, that even out of
their wickedness He works good to us: it was never His wish that they
should arise: “Grant to them,” He saith, “that they may be one” (<span
id="vi.xxxiii-p38.1"></span>[John xvii.
21](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#021)<span id="vi.xxxiii-p38.2"></span>.md):
but since offences do come, they are no hurt, to these, but even a
benefit: just as the persecutors unwillingly benefit the Martyrs by
dragging them to martyrdom, and yet they are not driven to this by God;
just so is it here. Let us not look (only at this), that men are
offended: this very thing is itself a proof of the excellence of the
doctrine—that many stimulate and counterfeit it: for it would not be so,
if it were not good. And this I will now show, and make on all hands
plain to you. Of perfumes, the fragrant spices are they which people
adulterate and counterfeit; as, for instance, the amomum leaf. For
because these are rare and of necessary use, therefore there come to be
spurious imitations likewise. Nobody would care to counterfeit any
common article. The pure life gets many a false pretender to it: no man
would care to counterfeit the man of vicious life; no, but the man of
monastic life.—What then shall we say to the heathen? There comes a
heathen and says, “I wish to become a Christian, but I know not whom to
join: there is much fighting and faction among you, much confusion:
which doctrine am I to choose?” How shall we answer him? “Each of you”
(says he) “asserts, ‘*I* speak the truth.’” (*b*) No <span
id="fr_782"></span>[783](#fn_782.md) doubt: this is in our favor. For if we
told you to be persuaded by arguments, you might well be perplexed: but
if we bid you believe the Scriptures, and these are simple and true, the
decision is easy for you. If any agree with the Scriptures, he is the
Christian; if any fight against them, he is far from this rule. (*a*)
“But which am I to believe, knowing as I do nothing at all of the
Scriptures? The others also allege the same thing for themselves. What
then (*c*)if the other come, and say that the Scripture has this, and
you that it has something different, and ye interpret the Scriptures
diversely, dragging their sense (each his own way)?” And you then, I
ask, have you no understanding, no judgment? “And how should I be able
(to decide),” says he, “I who do not even know how to judge of your
doctrines? I wish to become a learner, and you are making me forthwith a
teacher.” If he say this, what, say you, are we to answer him? How shall
we persuade him? Let us ask whether all this be not mere pretence and
subterfuge. Let us ask whether he has decided (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxiii-p39.4"></span>κατέγνωκε</span>) against the heathen (that
they are wrong). The fact <span id="fr_783"></span>[784](#fn_783.md) he
will assuredly affirm, for of course, if he had not so decided, he would
not have come to (enquire about) our matters: let us ask the grounds on
which he has decided, for to be sure he has not settled the matter out
of hand. Clearly he will say, “Because (their gods) are creatures, and
are not the uncreated God.” Good. If then he find this in the other
parties (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxiii-p40.6"></span>αἰρέσεις</span>), but among us the contrary,
what argument need we? We all confess that Christ is God. But let us see
who fight (against this truth), and who not. Now we, affirming Him to be
God speak of Him things worthy of God, that He hath power, that He is
not a slave, that He is free, that He doeth of Himself: whereas the
other says the reverse. Again I ask: if you would learn (to be) a
physician, <span id="fr_784"></span>[785](#fn_784.md) \* \* \*? And yet
among them are many (different) doctrines. For if you accept without
more ado just what you are told, this is not acting like a man: but if
you have judgment and sense, you shall assuredly know what is good. We
affirm the Son to be God, we verify (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxiii-p41.6"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxiii-p41.7"></span>παληθεύομεν</span>) what we affirm: but they
affirm indeed, but (in fact) confess not.—But <span
id="fr_785"></span>[786](#fn_785) to mention (something.md) even plainer:
those have certain persons from whom they are called, openly showing the
name of the heresiarch himself, and each heresy in like manner: with us,
no man has given us a name, but the faith itself. However, this (talk of
yours) is mere pretence and subterfuge. For answer me: how is it that if
you would buy a cloak, though ignorant of the art of weaving, you do not
speak such words as these—“I do not know how to buy; they cheat me”—but
do all you can to learn, and so whatever else it be that you would buy:
but here you speak these words? For at this rate, you will accept
nothing at all. For let there be one that has no (religious) doctrine
whatever: if he should say what you say about the Christians—“There is
such a multitude of men, and they have different doctrines; this a
heathen, that a Jew, the other a Christian: no need to accept any
doctrine whatever, for they are at variance one with another; but I am a
learner, and do not wish to be a judge” <span
id="fr_786"></span>[787](#fn_786) —but if you have yielded (so far as.md)
to pronounce against (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxiii-p43.8"></span>καταγινώσκειν</span>) one doctrine, this
pretext no longer has place for you. For just as you were able to reject
the spurious, so here also, having come, you shall be able to prove what
is profitable. For he that has not pronounced against any doctrine at
all, may easily say this: but he that has pronounced against any, though
he have chosen none, by going on in the same way, will be able to see
what he ought to do. Then let us not make pretexts and excuses, and all
will be easy. For, to show you that all this is mere excuse, answer me
this: Do you know what you ought to do, and what to leave undone? Then
why do you not what you ought? Do that, and by right reason seek of God,
and He will assuredly reveal it to thee. “God,” it saith, “is no
respecter of persons, but in every nation he that feareth Him, and
worketh righteousness, is accepted with Him.” ([Acts
10:34](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#034.md),
[35](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#035.md)<span
id="vi.xxxiii-p43.9"></span>.) It cannot be that he who hears without
prejudice should not be persuaded. For just as, if there were a rule, by
which everything behooved to be put straight, it would not need much
consideration, but it would be easy to detect the person who measures
falsely (<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxiii-p43.10"></span>τὸν
παραμετροὕντα λαβἕιν</span>), so is it here. “Then how is it they do not
see it at a glance?” Many things are the cause of this: both
preconceived opinion, and human causes (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxiii-p43.11"></span>αἰτίαι</span>). The others, say you, say
the same thing about us. How? For are we separated from the Church? have
we our heresiarchs? Are we called after men—as one of them has
Marcion, <span id="fr_787"></span>[788](#fn_787.md) another Manichæus, a
third Arius, for the author and leader (of his sect)? Whereas if we
likewise do receive an appellation from any man, we do not take them
that have been the authors of some heresy, but men that presided over
us, and governed the Church. We have no “masters upon the earth”—God
forbid—we have “One Master that is in heaven.” ([Matt.
23:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#009.md),
[10](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#010.md)<span
id="vi.xxxiii-p44.1"></span>.) “And those also,” says he, “say the
same.” But there stands the name set over them, accusing them, and
stopping their mouths.—How <span id="fr_788"></span>[789](#fn_788.md) is
it, there have been many heathen, and none of them asked these
questions: and among the philosophers there were these (differences),
and yet none of those holding the right party (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxiii-p45.5"></span>αἵρεσιν</span>) was hindered (thereby)?—Why
did not (those believers) say, when (the others) raised these questions,
“Both these and those are Jews: which must we believe?” But they
believed as they ought. Then let us also obey the laws of God, and do
all things according to His good pleasure, <span
id="fr_789"></span>[790](#fn_789.md) that having virtuously passed this
life present, we may be enabled to attain unto the good things promised
to them that love Him, by the grace and mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ,
with Whom to the Father and the Holy Ghost together, be glory, dominion,
honor, now and ever, world without end. Amen.

“Confirming the word of the prophets:” so Ed. Par. Ben. 2, where the
other Edd. have <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxiii-p5.4"></span>παλ. προφ. βεβ. κ. τ. λ</span>., which is in
fact what the sense requires: “from the prophets, new (as Symeon) and
old.”

<span id="vi.xxxiii-p6"></span> This was James, the Lord’s brother
([Gal. i. 19](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#019.md)<span
id="vi.xxxiii-p6.1"></span>), who, according to the uniform tradition of
the early church, was the Bishop of Jerusalem. He evidently was the
chief pastor, as he presides at this conference, and when Judaizing
teachers afterwards went down to Antioch from Jerusalem they are spoken
of as coming “from James” (<span id="vi.xxxiii-p6.2"></span>[Gal. ii.
12](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#012)<span id="vi.xxxiii-p6.3"></span>.md).
From this it has been inferred that he was the leader of a Judaistic
party, but this view is inconsistent with his address here and also with
Paul’s testimony who says that the “pillar” apostles “imparted nothing”
to him, that is, did not correct or supplement his teaching. He was no
doubt of a conservative tendency respecting the questions in dispute and
may not have been always self-consistent, as Peter certainly was not,
but there can be no doubt of his substantial agreement with Paul. His
doctrine of justification by works as well as by faith in his epistle is
not against this view, since he uses both the words “faith” and “works”
in a different sense from Paul, meaning by the former “belief” and by
the latter the deeds which are the fruit of the Christian life, instead
of meritorious obedience to the Mosaic law.—G.B.S.

that it does not occur to Chrys. that Symeon is Simon Peter, though [2

to say: “Some say that this is he who is mentioned by Luke: others, that
he is some other person of the same name. ([Acts xiii.
1](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#001)<span id="vi.xxxiii-p7.11"></span>?.md)
But whether it be the one or the other is a point about which there is
no need to be particular; but only to receive as necessary the things

general is, He was manifestly (a prophet), but had not the same
authority as the old prophets. Probably the form of opposition was this:
<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxiii-p8.3"></span>ἐ</span><span

That after Babylon.” We point it, <span class="Greek"><span

“Was it raised up? was it not rather razed to the ground (by the
Romans)? True it was rebuilt after the return from Babylon, but what
sort of raising up does he call that?” For the answer to these
questions, not given here, see the Recapitulation (note 4, p. 207).

id="vi.xxxiii-p10.5"></span>στι τῷ θεῷ πάντα τὰ ἔργα αὐτοῦ</span>. This
reading yields the following translation: “the Gentiles upon whom my
name is called, saith the Lord, who maketh these things known from the
beginning of the world.” (So Tischendorf, Alford, Meyer, Westcott and
Hort, Gloag. R.V.). This reading encounters the difficulty that the
words <span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxiii-p10.6"></span>γνωστὰ ἀπ᾽
αἰ& 242·νος</span> are considered as a part of the quotation which, in
reality, they are not. It is probable that this fact may have led to
their expansion into an independent sentence.—G.B.S.

id="vi.xxxiii-p13.2"></span>.—In the mod. text the matter is a good deal
transposed, without any necessity, and the Recapitulation is made to
begin after the sentence ending, “love of glory.”—This seems to be the
proper place for the first of the sentences following the
Recapitulation, p. 210, note 3, viz. “No more faction. On this occasion
I suppose it was that they received the right hand, as he says himself,
‘They gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship.’ On this

id="vi.xxxiii-p17.4"></span>πρῶτον</span>, as if the meaning were, God
“looked upon the Gentiles first to take from them,” before the Jews,
etc.—After the text, the questions left unanswered above (see note 2, p.
206) might be advantageously introduced. “How could that restoration
(after Babylon) be called an <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxiii-p17.5"></span>ἔ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxiii-p17.6"></span>γερσις</span>, especially as the city was
eventually razed to the ground by the Romans? True: but the kingdom of
David is in fact more gloriously raised up, in the reign of David’s
offspring throughout the world. As for the buildings and city, what loss
is that? Nay, David himself is more glorious now than he was before,
sung as he is in all parts of the world. If then this which the Prophet
foretold is come to pass—this is put as St. James’s arguments—namely
that the city was raised from its ruins (and the subsequent overthrow,
when the end of that restoration was attained, does not invalidate the
fulfilment), then must the <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxiii-p17.7"></span>διά τι</span> of this restoration also come
to pass, namely, that the residue shall seek the Lord, and all the
Gentiles upon whom that Name is called. The city, was raised up for the
sake of Christ, to come of them, and to reign over all nations.
Consequently, the Prophet shows that the <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxiii-p17.8"></span>αἴτιον</span> (i.e. the <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxiii-p17.9"></span>διά τι</span>, or final
clause) of the building of the city is—the calling of the Gentiles,
<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxiii-p17.10"></span>τὸ τὰ ἔθνη

the sense or connection is obscure.—Perhaps however these two sentences
may be better transposed to follow the part (*b*), so that the
connection would be, “And again, observe he has been speaking concerning
the Gentile converts, not openly of the Jewish believers, and yet in
fact what he says is no less for them.”—Mod. text with partial
transposition, “And he well says, To them, etc. declaring both the
purpose of God from the beginning with respect to them, and their
obedience and readiness for the calling. What means it? I judge? Instead
of, With authority I say that this is so. ‘But that we write to them,’
he says, ‘to abstain from’ etc. For these, though bodily, etc. (as
below.) And that none may object, why then do we not enjoin the same
thing to the Jews? He adds, ‘For Moses,’ etc.: i.e. Moses discourses to
them continually: for this is the meaning of, ‘Being read every Sabbath
day.’ See what condescension!”

referred perhaps to Moses or the Law, as in the trajection this sentence
follows the last of (*a*). The clause seems to refer to “pollutions of
idols and fornication.” q. d. “Why mention these in the decree? The
Apostles, especially Paul, often discoursed to them on behalf of these
points of Christian duty, i.e. the abstaining from all approach to
idolatry, as in the matter of <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxiii-p22.5"></span>εἰδωλόθυτα</span>, and from fornication.”
The answer is: “He mentions them, for the purpose of seeming to maintain
the Law, (though at the same time he does not rest them on the authority
of the Law, but on that of the Apostles: still the Jewish believers
would be gratified by this apparent acknowledgment of the Law), and
(with the same view) to make a greater number of <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxiii-p22.6"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxiii-p22.7"></span>ντολαὶ</span>, for which
reason also he divides the one legal prohibition of blood into the two,
<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxiii-p22.8"></span>ἀ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxiii-p22.9"></span>πὸ τῶν πνικτῶν καὶ ἀπὸ
τοῦ αἵματος</span>. The latter, he says, though <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxiii-p22.10"></span>σωματικαὶ</span>, are
necessary to be observed because the non-observance of this law on which
the Jews laid so much stress led to great evils—especially made it
impossible for Jewish and Gentile believers to eat at the same table.
For in every city Moses is preached to Jews and proselytes. Therefore I
say it is good that we charge them by letter to abstain from these
things.” Then, giving a different turn to the reason, “for Moses of old
times,” etc. he adds. “this is for them which from the Gentiles,” etc.,
as for the Jewish believers, they have Moses to teach them. Thus again
seeming to uphold Moses, while in fact he shows, what they might learn
from Moses himself, that the Law is come to an end for the Jews also.

<span id="fn_768"></span>[i:769](1110038.htm#fr_768.md) <span
id="vi.xxxiii-p22.15"></span>

<span id="vi.xxxiii-p23"></span> The prohibitions imposed by the council
upon the Gentiles were chiefly concessions to Jewish prejudice and
opinion. Abstinence from meat which had been offered in idols’ temples
and from things strangled and from blood was forbidden in the Mosaic law
(<span id="vi.xxxiii-p23.1"></span>[Ex. xxxiv.
15](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#015.md)<span id="vi.xxxiii-p23.2"></span>;
[Lev. xvii. 10-14](../../../bib/kjv/lev017.htm#010.md)<span
id="vi.xxxiii-p23.3"></span>). Failure to abstain from these would
expose the Gentile converts needlessly to the suspicions of the Jewish
Christians. The prohibition of fornication must rest upon another
ground. It is a warning against the custom among Gentiles, which had
become so prevalent as to provoke little rebuke or comment. The ground
assigned for requiring these abstinences is that Moses is read every
Sabbath in the synagogues of the Jews and therefore these very points
are kept prominently before the people and therefore unless these
indulgences were abandoned, the synagogue preaching would constantly
stimulate in the Jews and Judeo-Christians a dislike of the Gentile
believers. There is less ground for the view of Chrys. that [Acts
15.21](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#021.md)<span
id="vi.xxxiii-p23.4"></span>. means that the Jewish Christians have no
need of instruction on these points because they hear the law read every
Sabbath, an explanation, however, which is adopted by such modern
scholars as Wordsworth and Neander.—G.B.S.

<span id="vi.xxxiii-p29"></span> <span class="Greek"><span

but the word is used in the Greek of Chrysostom’s time, in the sense
“conceal,” for which Schneider s. v. refers to Valesius on Harpocrat. p.
145. Gronov. in which sense we have rendered it above. Or perhaps, “had
wrested it” to make it speak in their favor. <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxiii-p29.2"></span>Τὸ ζητούμενον συναρπάζειν</span> is a
logical phrase, used of one who commits a *petitio principii.* St.
Chrys. however can hardly be correctly reported here: for the letter
itself would show, if it were believed to be genuine, that Paul and
Barnabas neither <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxiii-p29.3"></span>συνήρπασαν</span> nor <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxiii-p29.4"></span>ἄ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxiii-p29.5"></span>λλα ἀντ᾽ ἄλλων
εἰπαν</span>. He may rather be supposed to have said in substance as
follows: “Had Paul and Barnabas returned alone as the bearers of an oral
communication, it might be suspected that they gave their own account of
the matter: had they come alone, bearing the Epistle, its genuineness
might have been called in question: but by sending the Epistle by the
hands of men of their own and of high consideration, they left no room
for doubt as to the fact of their decision. On the other hand, to have
sent these men alone, would have looked like putting a slight upon
Barnabas and Paul: but by sending the messengers with them, they showed
<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxiii-p29.6"></span>ὅ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxiii-p29.7"></span>τι ἀξιόπιστοι

stopped the mouths of the gainsayers.”

<span id="fn_775"></span>[i:776](1110038.htm#fr_775.md) <span
id="vi.xxxiii-p29.9"></span>

<span id="vi.xxxiii-p30"></span> The innovator completely mistakes the
meaning of this clause: not having the text to guide him, he supposes it
to refer to Silas and Judas, and alters thus: “It shows how worthy of
credit they are: not making themselves equal, ‘it says: they are not so
mad. In fact, this is why it adds that expression, Which have hazarded
their lives, etc. And why does it say, “It seemed good to the Holy Ghost
and to us,” and yet it had sufficed.” etc.—Below, he has “‘To lay upon
you no greater burden.’ This they say, because they have to speak,” etc.
But all this belongs to <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxiii-p30.1"></span>ἔ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxiii-p30.2"></span>δοξεν ἡμῖν</span> q.d. “You need not fear
us, neither is it of condescension that we speak, or to spare you as
being weak—quite the contrary—it seems good to the Holy Ghost “and to
us.”

id="vi.xxxiii-p31.1"></span>πολλὴ γὰρ καὶ τῶν διδασκάλων αἰδὼς

shown by the teachers also towards them—as in St. Peter’s <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxiii-p31.2"></span>ὥ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xxxiii-p31.3"></span>σπερ κἀκεῖνοι</span>—and
therefore they did not treat them as “weak;” or, great was their
reverence towards their teachers, so that had they laid upon them a
greater burden, they would have borne it.

that was a superfluous burden” seems to be the proper place for these
sentences from below, see note 3, *infra.* “It shows that the rest are
not necessary but superfluous, seeing these things are necessary. “From
which if ye keep yourselves ye shall do well.” It shows that nothing is
lacking to them, but this is sufficient.”

<span id="vi.xxxiii-p35"></span> What follows consists of notes which
the redactor did not bring to their proper places. “No more
faction—admired it,” see note 1, p. 207. “It shows—the Spirit,” may
belong either to the comment on <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xxxiii-p35.1"></span>κρίνω ἐγὼ</span>, or to that on “It seemed
good to the Holy Ghost and to us.”—“It shows that the rest—sufficient,”
see note 1. These parts being removed, the remainder forms the
continuation of the sentence, “it behooved to be done by these,” note 2.
The concluding words <span class="Greek"><span

conflicting opinions and you would exercise your judgment upon them, not
accept all without examination. Do so here; and in the instance which

corrupt, or misplaced: for to say that “there have been many heathen,
and none of them has asked these questions” (about Christian doctrines),
would contradict all that precedes: and if it means, There were many
Greeks, and diverse schools of philosophy among them, and yet none was
deterred from the study of philosophy by those differences, this would
not be true. But if this be transposed to the following sentence, which
relates to the <span class="Greek"><span
