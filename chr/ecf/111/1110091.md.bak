<span id="vii.xxx"></span> <span id="vii.xxx-p0.1"></span>

<span id="vii.xxx-p1"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vii.xxx-p1.1"></span>Homily XXVIII.</span>

<span id="vii.xxx-p2"></span>[Rom. XV.
8](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#008.md)<span id="vii.xxx-p2.1"></span>

<span id="vii.xxx-p3"></span>“Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister
of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made
unto the fathers.”

<span id="vii.xxx-p4"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="vii.xxx-p4.1"></span>Again</span>, he is speaking of Christ’s
concern for us, still holding to the same topic, and showing what great
things He hath done for us, and how “He pleased not Himself.” ([Rom. xv.
3](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#003)<span id="vii.xxx-p4.2"></span>..md) And
besides this, there is another point which he makes good, that those of
the Gentiles are debtors to a larger amount unto God. And if to a larger
amount, then they ought to bear with the weak among the Jews. For since
he had spoken very sharply to such, lest this should make these elated,
he humbles their unreasonableness, by showing that it was by “promise
made to the fathers” that they had the good things given them, while
they of the Gentiles had them out of pity and love toward man only. And
this is the reason of his saying, “And that the Gentiles might glorify
God for his mercy.” But that what is said may be made plainer, it is
well to listen once more to the words themselves, that you may see what
Christ’s having been made “a Minister of the circumcision for the truth
of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers,” means. What then
is that which is stated? There had been a promise made to Abraham,
saying, “Unto thee will I give the earth, and to thy seed, and in thy
seed shall all the nations be blessed.” (<span
id="vii.xxx-p4.3"></span>[Gen. xii.
7](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#007.md)<span id="vii.xxx-p4.4"></span>;
xxii. 18.) But after this, they of the seed of Abraham all became
subject to punishment. For the Law wrought wrath unto them by being
transgressed, and thenceforward deprived them of that promise made unto
the fathers. Therefore the Son came and wrought with the Father, in
order that those promises might come true, and have their issue. For
having fulfilled the whole Law in which He also fulfilled the
circumcision, and having by it, and by the Cross, freed them from the
curse of the transgression, He suffered not this promise to fall to the
ground. When then he calls Him “a Minister of the circumcision,” he
means this, that by having come and fulfilled the Law, and been
circumcised, and born of the seed of Abraham, He undid the curse, stayed
the anger of God, made also those that were to receive the promises fit
for them, as being once for all freed from their alienation. To prevent
then these accused persons from saying, How then came Christ to be
circumcised and to keep the whole Law? he turns their argument to the
opposite conclusion. For it was not that the Law might continue, but
that He might put an end to it, and free thee from the curse thereof,
and set thee entirely at liberty from the dominion of that Law. For it
was because thou hadst transgressed the Law, that He fulfilled it, not
that thou mightest fulfil it, <span id="fr_1630"></span>[1631](#fn_1630.md)
but that He might confirm to thee the promises made unto the fathers,
which the Law had caused to be suspended, by showing thee to have
offended, <span id="fr_1631"></span>[1632](#fn_1631.md) and to be unworthy
of the inheritance. And so thou also art saved by grace, since thou wast
cast off. Do not thou then bicker, nor perversely cling to the Law at
this unsuitable time, since it would have cast thee also out of the
promise, unless Christ had suffered so many things for thee. And He did
suffer these, not because thou wast deserving of salvation, but that God
might be true. And then that this might not puff up him of the Gentiles,
he says.

<span id="vii.xxx-p7"></span>[Rom.
15.9](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#009.md)<span id="vii.xxx-p7.1"></span>.
“And that the Gentiles might glorify God for His mercy.”

<span id="vii.xxx-p8"></span>But what he means is this. Those of the
Jews would have had promises, even though they were unworthy. But thou
hadst not this even, but wast saved from love towards man alone, even
if, to put it at the lowest, they too would not have been the better for
the promises, unless Christ had come. But yet that he might amalgamate
(or temper, <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xxx-p8.1"></span>κεράσῃ</span>) them and not allow them to rise
up against the weak, he makes mention of the promises. But of these he
says that it was by mercy alone that they were saved. Hence they are the
most bound to glorify God. And a glory it is to God that they be blended
together, be united, praise with one mind, bear the weaker, neglect not
the member that is broken off. Then he adds testimonies, in which he
shows that the man of the Jews ought to blend himself with those of the
Gentiles; and so he says, “As it is written, For this cause I will
confess to Thee among the Gentiles, O Lord, and will sing unto Thy
Name.” <span id="fr_1632"></span>[1633](#fn_1632.md) ([Ps. xviii.
46](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#046)<span id="vii.xxx-p9.8"></span>..md)

<span id="vii.xxx-p10"></span>[Rom.
15.10-12](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#010.md)<span
id="vii.xxx-p10.1"></span>. “And, rejoice, ye Gentiles, with His people.
And, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles” (<span
id="vii.xxx-p10.2"></span>[Deut. xxxii.
43](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#043)<span id="vii.xxx-p10.3"></span>.md);
“and let all people laud Him.” ([Ps. cxvii.
1](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#001)<span id="vii.xxx-p10.4"></span>..md)
“And, There shall be a root of Jesse, and He that shall rise to reign
over the Gentiles, in Him shall the Gentiles trust.” (<span
id="vii.xxx-p10.5"></span>[Isa. 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001.md),
[10](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#010)<span id="vii.xxx-p10.6"></span>..md)

<span id="vii.xxx-p11"></span>Now all these quotations he has given to
show that we ought to be united, and to glorify God; and also, to humble
the Jew, that he may not lift himself up over these, since all the
prophets called these, as well as to persuade the man of the Gentiles to
be lowly, by showing him that he had a larger grace to answer for. Then
he concludes his argument with a prayer again.

<span id="vii.xxx-p12"></span>[Rom.
15.13](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#013.md)<span id="vii.xxx-p12.1"></span>.
“Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that
ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost.”

<span id="vii.xxx-p13"></span>That is, that ye may get clear of that
heartlessness (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xxx-p13.1"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.xxx-p13.2"></span>θυμίας</span>) towards one another, and may
never be cast down by temptations. And this will be by your abounding in
hope. Now this is the cause of all good things, and it comes from the
Holy Ghost. But it is not simply from the Spirit, but on condition of
our contributing our part also. This is why he says, “in believing.” For
this is the way for you to be filled with joy, if ye believe, if ye
hope. Yet he does not say if ye hope, but, “if ye abound in hope,” so as
not to find comfort in troubles only, but even to have joy through the
abundance of faith and hope. And in this way, ye will also draw the
Spirit to you. In this way, when He is come ye will continually keep to
all good things. For just as food maintaineth our life, and by this
ruleth the body, <span id="fr_1633"></span>[1634](#fn_1633.md) so if we
have good works, we shall have the Spirit; and if we have the Spirit, we
shall also have good works. As also, on the other hand, if we have no
works, the Spirit flieth away. But if we be deserted by the Spirit, we
shall also halt in our works. For when this hath gone, the unclean one
cometh: this is plain from Saul. For what if he doth not choke <span
id="fr_1634"></span>[1635](#fn_1634.md) us as he did him, still he
strangles us in some other way by wicked works. We have need then of the
harp of David, that we may charm our souls with the divine songs, both
these, and those from good actions. Since if we do the one only, and
while we listen to the charm, war with the charmer by our actions, as he
did of old (<span id="vii.xxx-p15.6"></span>[1 Sam. xix.
10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1019.htm#010)<span id="vii.xxx-p15.7"></span>.md);
the remedy will even turn to judgment to us, and the madness become the
more furious. For before we heard, the wicked demon was afraid lest we
should hear it and recover. But when after hearing it even, we continue
the same as we were, this is the very thing to rid him of his fear. Let
us sing then the Psalm of good deeds, that we may cast out the sin that
is worse than the demon. For a demon certainly will not deprive us of
heaven, but doth in some cases <span
id="fr_1635"></span>[1636](#fn_1635.md) even work with the sober-minded.
But sin will assuredly cast us out. For this is a demon we willingly
receive, a self-chosen madness. Wherefore also it hath none to pity it
or to pardon it. Let us then sing charms over a soul in this plight, as
well from the other Scriptures, as also from the blessed David. And let
the mouth sing, and the mind be instructed. Even this is no small thing.
For if we once teach the tongue to sing, the soul will be ashamed to be
devising the opposite of what this singeth. Nor is this the only good
thing that we shall gain, for we shall also come to know many things
which are our interest. For he discourseth to thee both of things
present, and things to come, and of things seen, and of the invisible
Creation. And if thou wouldest learn about the Heaven, whether it
abideth as it is or shall be changed, he gives thee a clear answer, and
will say, “The heavens shall wax old as doth a garment, and as a vesture
shalt thou fold them up, O God, and they shall be changed.” (<span
id="vii.xxx-p16.7"></span>[Ps. cii.
26](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#026)<span id="vii.xxx-p16.8"></span>..md)
And if thou wishest to hear of the form of them again, thou shalt hear,
“That spreadeth forth the Heaven like a curtain” (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.xxx-p16.9"></span>δέρριν</span>). And if
thou be minded to know further about the back of them, he will tell thee
again, “that covereth His upper chambers with waters.” ([Ps.
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#002.md),
[3](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#003)<span id="vii.xxx-p16.10"></span>..md)
And even here he does not pause, but will likewise discourse with thee
on the breadth and height, and show thee that these are of equal
measure. For, “As far as the east,” he says, “is from the west, so far
hath He set our iniquities from us. Like as the heaven’s height above
the earth, so is the Lord’s mercy upon them that fear Him.” ([Ps.
103:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#012.md),
[11](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#011)<span id="vii.xxx-p16.11"></span>..md)
But if thou wouldest busy thyself with the foundation of the earth, even
this he will not hide from thee, but thou shalt hear him singing and
saying, “He hath founded it upon the seas.” ([Psa.
24.2](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#002.md)<span
id="vii.xxx-p16.12"></span>.) And if of earthquakes thou art desirous to
know, whence they come, he will free thee from this difficulty also, by
saying, “That looketh upon the earth, and maketh it tremble.” ([Psa.
104.32](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#032.md)<span
id="vii.xxx-p16.13"></span>.) And if thou enquire the use of the night,
this too mayest thou learn, and know from him. For “therein all the
beasts of the forest do move.” ([Psa.
104.20](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#020.md)<span
id="vii.xxx-p16.14"></span>.) And in what way the mountains are for use,
he will tell thee, “The high mountains are for the stags.” And why there
are rocks, “The rocks are a refuge for the porcupines.” ([Psa.
104.18](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#018.md)<span
id="vii.xxx-p16.15"></span>.) Why are there trees yielding no fruit?
learn from him, for “there the sparrows build their nests.” ([Psa.
104.17](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#017.md)<span
id="vii.xxx-p16.16"></span>.) Why are there fountains in the
wildernesses? hear, “that by them the fowls of the heaven dwell, and the
wild beasts.” ([Psa. 104.12](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#012.md)<span
id="vii.xxx-p16.17"></span>.) Why is there wine? not that thou mayest
drink only (for water is of a nature to suffice for this), but that thou
mayest be gladdened also, “For wine maketh glad the heart of man.”
([Psa. 104.15](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#015.md)<span
id="vii.xxx-p16.18"></span>.) And by knowing this you will know how far
the use of wine is allowable. Whence are the fowls and the wild beasts
nourished? thou wilt hear from his words, “All these wait upon Thee, to
give them their meat in due season.” ([Psa.
104.27](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#027.md)<span
id="vii.xxx-p16.19"></span>.) If thou sayest, For what purpose are the
cattle? he will answer thee, that these also are for thee, “That causeth
the grass,” he says, “to grow for the cattle, and the green herb for the
service (or retinue)of men.” ([Psa.
104.14](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#014.md)<span
id="vii.xxx-p16.20"></span>.) What is the use of the moon? hear him
saying, “He made the moon for seasons.” ([Psa.
104.19](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#019.md)<span
id="vii.xxx-p16.21"></span>[Ps. civ.
19](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#019)<span id="vii.xxx-p16.22"></span>..md)
And that all things seen and those not seen are made, is a thing that he
has also clearly taught us by saying, “Himself spake, and they were
made, He commanded, and they were created.” ([Psa.
33.9](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#009.md)<span
id="vii.xxx-p16.23"></span>.) And that there is an end of death, this he
also teaches when he says, “God shall deliver my soul from the hand of
hell when He shall receive me.” ([Psa.
44.15](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#015.md)<span
id="vii.xxx-p16.24"></span>.) Whence was our body made? he also tells
us; “He remembereth that we are dust” ([Psa.
103.14](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#014.md)<span
id="vii.xxx-p16.25"></span>); and again, whither goeth it away? “It
shall return to its dust.” ([Psa.
104.29](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#029.md)<span
id="vii.xxx-p16.26"></span>.) Why was this universe made? For thee: “For
thou crownest him with glory and honor, and settest him over the works
of Thy hands.” ([Ps. 8:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#005.md),
[6](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#006)<span id="vii.xxx-p16.27"></span>..md)
Have we men any community with the Angels? This he also tells us, saying
as follows, “Thou hast made him a little lower than the Angels.” Of the
love of God, “Like as a father pitieth his own children, even so is the
Lord merciful to them that fear Him.” ([Psa.
103.13](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#013.md)<span
id="vii.xxx-p16.28"></span>.) And of the things that are to meet us
after our present life, and of that undisturbed condition, he teacheth,
“Return unto thy rest, O my soul.” ([Psa.
116.7](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#007.md)<span
id="vii.xxx-p16.29"></span>.) Why the Heaven is so great, this he will
also say. For it is because “the heavens declare the glory of God.”
([Psa. 19.1](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#001.md)<span
id="vii.xxx-p16.30"></span>.) Why day and night were made,—not that they
may shine and give us rest only, but also that they may instruct us.
“For there are no speeches nor words, the sounds of which (i.e. day and
night) are not heard.” ([Psa.
19.3](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#003.md)<span
id="vii.xxx-p16.31"></span>.) How the sea lies round about the earth,
this too thou wilt learn from hence. “The deep as a garment is the
envelopment thereof.” <span id="fr_1636"></span>[1637](#fn_1636.md) For so
the Hebrew has it.

<span id="vii.xxx-p18"></span>But having a sample in what I have
mentioned, ye will have a notion of all the rest besides, the things
about Christ, about the resurrection, about the life to come, about the
resting, about punishment, about moral matters, all that concerns
doctrines, and you will find the book filled with countless blessings.
And if you fall into temptations, you will gain much comfort from hence.
If you fall into sins even, you will find countless remedies stored up
here, or if into poverty or tribulation, you will see many havens. And
if thou be righteous thou wilt gain much security hence, and if a sinner
much relief. For if thou be just and art ill-treated, thou wilt hear him
say, “For Thy sake are we killed all the day long, we are counted as
sheep for the slaughter.” (<span id="vii.xxx-p18.1"></span>[Ps. xliv.
22](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#022)<span id="vii.xxx-p18.2"></span>..md)
“All these things have come upon us, and yet have we not forgotten
Thee.” ([Psa. 44.17](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#017.md)<span
id="vii.xxx-p18.3"></span>.) And if thy well-doings make thee high, thou
wilt hear him say, “Enter not into judgment with Thy servant, for in Thy
sight shall no man living be justified” ([Psa.
143.2](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#002.md)<span
id="vii.xxx-p18.4"></span>), and thou wilt be straightway made lowly.
And if thou be a sinner, and hast despaired of thyself, thou wilt hear
him continually singing, “To-day, if ye will hear His voice, harden not
your hearts, as in the provocation” ([Ps.
95:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#007.md),
[8](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#008)<span id="vii.xxx-p18.5"></span>.md),
and thou wilt be stayed up speedily. And if thou have a crown even on
thy head, and art high-minded, thou wilt learn that “a king is not saved
by a great host, neither shall a giant be saved by the greatness of his
might” ([Psa. 33.16](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#016.md)<span
id="vii.xxx-p18.6"></span>): and thou wilt find thyself able to be
reasonable. If thou be rich, and in reputation, again thou wilt hear him
singing, “Woe to them that trust in their own might, and boast
themselves in the multitude of their riches,” ([Psa.
49.6](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#006)<span id="vii.xxx-p18.7"></span>..md)
And, “As for man, his days are as grass” ([Psa.
103.15](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#015.md)<span
id="vii.xxx-p18.8"></span>), And “His glory shall not go down with him,
after him” ([Psa. 49.17](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#017.md)<span
id="vii.xxx-p18.9"></span>): and thou wilt not think any of the things
upon the earth are great. For when what is more splendid than all, even
glory and power, is so worthless, what else of things on earth is worth
accounting of? But art thou in despondency? Hear him saying, “Why art
thou so sorrowful, O my soul, and why dost thou so disturb me? Trust in
God, for I will confess unto Him.” ([Psa.
42.5](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#005.md)<span
id="vii.xxx-p18.10"></span>.) Or dost thou see men in honor who deserve
it not? <span id="fr_1637"></span>[1638](#fn_1637.md) “Fret not thyself at
them that do wickedly. For as the grass shall they be dried up, and as
the green herb shall they soon fall away.” ([Ps.
37:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#001.md),
[2](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#002)<span id="vii.xxx-p19.2"></span>.md)
Dost thou see both righteous and sinners punished? be told that the
cause is not the same. For “many” he says, “are the plagues of sinners.”
([Psa. 32.10](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#010.md)<span
id="vii.xxx-p19.3"></span>.) But in the case of the righteous, he does
not say plagues, <span id="fr_1638"></span>[1639](#fn_1638.md) but, “Many
are the troubles of the righteous, but the Lord delivereth them out of
them all.” ([Psa. 34.19](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#019.md)<span
id="vii.xxx-p20.2"></span>.) And again, “The death of the sinner is
evil.” ([Psa. 34.21](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#021.md)<span
id="vii.xxx-p20.3"></span>.) And, “Precious in the sight of the Lord is
the death of His saints.” ([Psa.
116.15](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#015.md)<span
id="vii.xxx-p20.4"></span>.) These things do thou say continually: by
these be instructed. For every single word of this has in it an
indiscoverable ocean of meaning. For we have been just running over them
only: but if you were minded to give these passages accurate
investigation, you will see the riches to be great. But at present it is
possible even by what I have given, to get cleared of the passions that
lie on you. For since he forbids our envying, or being grieved, or
despondent out of season, or thinking that riches are anything, or
tribulation, or poverty, or fancying life itself to be anything, he
frees thee from all passions. So for this let us give thanks to God, and
let us have our treasure always in hand, “that by patience and comfort
of the Scriptures we may have hope” (<span
id="vii.xxx-p20.5"></span>[Rom. xv.
4](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#004)<span id="vii.xxx-p20.6"></span>.md),
and enjoy the good things to come. Which God grant that we may all
attain, by the grace and love toward man of our Lord Jesus Christ. By
Whom and with Whom, etc.

<span id="vii.xxx-p9"></span> The quotations in the passage on which
this homily is based are all taken from the LXX. with a few trifling
verbal changes. They are designed to show that the prophetic conception
of the Messiah’s work contemplated salvation for the Gentiles, so that
Christ was not to be merely a “minister of the circumcision,” but that
he is to bring through the Jews salvation to the Gentiles so that they
shall “glorify God for his mercy” ([Rom.
15.9](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#009)<span id="vii.xxx-p9.1"></span>.md).
The passages in the O.T. relate primarily either to the Psalmist himself
