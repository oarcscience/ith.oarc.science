<span id="vi.xlvi-p1"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vi.xlvi-p1.1"></span>Homily XLVI.</span>

<span id="vi.xlvi-p2"></span>[Acts
21:18](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#018.md),
[19](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#019.md)<span id="vi.xlvi-p2.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xlvi-p3"></span>“And the day following Paul went in with us
unto James: and all the elders were present. And when he had saluted
them, he declared particularly what things God had wrought among the
Gentiles by his ministry.”

<span id="vi.xlvi-p4"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="vi.xlvi-p4.1"></span>This</span> was the Bishop of Jerusalem; and to
him (Paul) is sent on an earlier occasion. This (James) was brother of
the Lord; a great and admirable man. (To him, it says,) “Paul entered in
with us.” Mark the (Bishop’s) unassuming behavior: “and the elders”
(were present). Again Paul relates to them the things relating to the
Gentiles, not indulging in vainglory, God forbid, but wishing to show
forth the mercy of God, and to fill them with great joy. ([Acts
15](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#000)<span id="vi.xlvi-p4.2"></span>..md)
See accordingly: “when they heard it,” it says, “they glorified
God,”—not praised nor admired Paul: for in such wise had he narrated, as
referring all to Him—“and said unto him, Thou seest, brother, how many
thousands of Jews there are which believed.” Observe with what modest
deference they too speak: “they said to him:” not (James) as Bishop
discourses authoritatively, but they take Paul as partner with them in
their view; “Thou seest, brother:” as though immediately and at the
outset apologizing for themselves, and saying, “We did not wish this.
Seest thou the necessity of the thing? ‘how many thousands,’ say they,
‘of Jews there are which’ have come together.” And they say not, “how
many thousands we have made catechumens,” but, “there are. And these,”
say they, “are all zealous for the law.” ([Acts
21.20](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#020)<span id="vi.xlvi-p4.3"></span>..md)
Two reasons—the number of them, and their views. For neither had they
been few, would it have been right to despise them: nor, if they were
many and did not all cling to the law, would there have been need to
make much account of them. Then also a third cause is given: “And they
all,” it says, “have been informed of thee”—they say not,“have heard,”
but <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xlvi-p4.4"></span>κατηχήθησαν</span>, that is, so they have
believed, and have been taught, “that thou teachest apostasy from Moses
to all the Jews which are among the Gentiles, by telling them not to
circumcise their children, neither to walk after the customs.” ([Acts
21.21](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#021)<span id="vi.xlvi-p4.5"></span>..md)
“What is it therefore? the multitude must needs come together: for they
will hear that thou art come. Do therefore this that we say to thee”
([Acts 21:22](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#022.md),
[23](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#023)<span id="vi.xlvi-p4.6"></span>.md):
they say these things as advising, not as commanding. “We have four men
which have a vow on them; them take, and purify thyself with them, and
be at charges with them.” Make thy defence in act, not in word—“that
they may shave themselves,” it says, “and all may know that those
things, whereof they were informed concerning thee, are nothing; but
that thou thyself also walkest orderly, and keepest the law” ([Acts
21:23](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#023.md),
[24](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#024)<span id="vi.xlvi-p4.7"></span>.md):
they say not, “teachest,” but, of superabundance, “that thou thyself
also keepest the law.” For of course not this was the matter of chief
interest, whether he did not teach others, but, that he did himself
observe the law. “What then” (he might say), “if the Gentiles should
learn it? I shall injure them.” How so? say they, seeing that even we,
the teachers of the Jews, have sent unto them. “As touching the Gentiles
which believe, we have written and concluded that they observe no such
thing, save only that they keep themselves from things offered to idols,
and from blood, and from strangled, and from fornication.” ([Acts
21.25](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#025)<span id="vi.xlvi-p4.8"></span>..md)
Here with a kind of remonstrance (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xlvi-p4.9"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xlvi-p4.10"></span>ντρεπτικὥς</span>), As “we,” say they,
commanded them, although we are preachers to the Jews, so do thou,
although a preacher to the Gentiles, cooperate with us. Observe Paul: he
does not say, “Well, but I can bring forward Timothy, whom I
circumcised: well, but I can satisfy them by what I have to say (of
myself):” but he complied, and did all: for in fact thus was it
expedient (to do). <span id="fr_1047"></span>[1048](#fn_1047.md) For it was
one thing to take (effectual) measures for clearing himself, and another
to have done these things without the knowledge of any (of the parties).
It was a step open to no suspicion, the fact of his even bearing the
expenses. “Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself
with them entered into the temple, signifying the accomplishment of the
days of purification, until that an offering should be offered for every
one of them.” ([Acts 21.26](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#026.md)<span
id="vi.xlvi-p5.1"></span>.) “Signifying,” <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xlvi-p5.2"></span>διαγγέλλων</span>, i.e. <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xlvi-p5.3"></span>καταγγέλλων</span>,
publicly notifying: so that it was he who made himself conspicuous. “And
when the seven days were about to be completed, the Jews from Asia”—for
(his arrival) most keeps times with theirs <span
id="fr_1048"></span>[1049](#fn_1048.md) —“when they saw him in the temple,
stirred up all the people, and laid hands on him, crying out, Men of
Israel, help: This is the man, that teacheth all men everywhere against
the people, and the law, and this place: and further brought Greeks also
into the temple, and hath polluted this holy place.” ([Acts
21:27](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#027.md),
[28](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#028)<span id="vi.xlvi-p6.5"></span>..md)
Mark their habitual conduct, how turbulent we everywhere find it, how
men who with or without reason make a clamor in the midst. <span
id="fr_1049"></span>[1050](#fn_1049.md) “For they had seen before with him
in the city Trophimus an Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had
brought into the temple. And all the city was moved, and the people ran
together: and they took Paul, and drew him out of the temple and
forthwith the doors were shut.” ([Acts
21:29](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#029.md),
[30](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#030)<span id="vi.xlvi-p7.4"></span>..md)
“Men of Israel,” it says, “help: this is the man that (teaches) against
the people, and the law, and this place.”—the things which most trouble
them, the Temple and the Law. And Paul does not tax the Apostles with
being the cause of these things to him. “And they drew him,” it says,
“out of the Temple: and the doors were shut.” For they wished to kill
him; and therefore were dragging him out, to do this with greater
security. “And as they went about to kill him, tidings came unto the
tribune of the cohort, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar. Who
immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down unto them: and
when they saw the tribune and the soldiers, they left beating of Paul.
Then the tribune came near, and took him, and commanded him to be bound
with two chains; and demanded who he was, and what he had done. And some
cried one thing, some another, among the multitude.” ([Acts
21.31-34](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#031.md)<span
id="vi.xlvi-p7.5"></span>.) But the tribune having come down delivered
him, and “commanded him to be bound with two chains:” (hereby) appeasing
the anger of the people. “And when he could not know the certainty for
the tumult, he commanded him to be carried into the castle. And when he
came upon the stairs, so it was, that he was borne of the soldiers for
the violence of the people. For the multitude of the people followed
after, crying, Away with him!” ([Acts
21.34-36](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#034.md)<span
id="vi.xlvi-p7.6"></span>.) What means, “Away with him?” that is, what
they say with us according to the Roman custom, To the standards with
him! <span id="fr_1050"></span>[1051](#fn_1050.md) “And as Paul was to be
led into the castle, he said unto the tribune, May I speak unto thee?”
([Acts 21.37](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#037.md)<span
id="vi.xlvi-p8.10"></span>.) In the act of being borne along up the
stairs, he requests to say something to the tribune: and observe how
quietly he does it. “May I speak unto thee?” he says. “Who said, Canst
thou speak Greek? Art thou not then that Egyptian, which before these
days madest an uproar, and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand
men that were murderers?” ([Acts
21.38](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#038.md)<span
id="vi.xlvi-p8.11"></span>.) For (this Egyptian) was a revolutionary and
seditious person. With regard to this then Paul clears himself, and \*
\*  <span id="fr_1051"></span>[1052](#fn_1051.md)

<span id="vi.xlvi-p10"></span>(Recapitulation.) “Do therefore this that
we say unto thee,” etc. ([Acts 21:23](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#023.md),
[24](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#024)<span id="vi.xlvi-p10.1"></span>..md)
He shows that it was not necessary to do this upon principle (<span
class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xlvi-p10.2"></span>προηγουμένως</span>)—whence also they obtain
his compliance—but that it was economy and condescension. <span
id="fr_1052"></span>[1053](#fn_1052.md) “As touching the Gentiles,” etc.
([Acts 21.25](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#025.md)<span
id="vi.xlvi-p11.3"></span>.) Why, then, this was no hindrance to the
preaching, seeing they themselves legislated for them to this effect.
Why, then, <span id="fr_1053"></span>[1054](#fn_1053.md) in his taking
Peter to task he does not absolutely (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xlvi-p12.6"></span>ἁ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xlvi-p12.7"></span>πλὥς</span>) charge him with doing wrong: for
precisely what he does on this occasion himself, the same does Peter on
that occasion, (merely) holding his peace, and establishing his
doctrine. ([Gal. ii. 11](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#011.md)<span
id="vi.xlvi-p12.8"></span>.) And he says not, For why? it is not right
to teach those among the Gentiles. “It is not enough to have not (so)
preached there, but there was need also to do something more, that those
may be persuaded that thou observest the law. The affair is one of
condescension, be not alarmed.” They do not advise him (to this course)
sooner, until they have first spoken of the economy and the gain. “And
besides, the doing this in Jerusalem, is a thing to be borne. ‘Do thou
this thing therefore’ here, that it may be in thy power abroad to do the
other.” (*b*) “The next day,” it says, “he took them” ([Acts
21.26](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#026.md)<span
id="vi.xlvi-p12.9"></span>): he deferred it not; for when there is
economy in the case, this is the way of it. (*a*) “Jews from Asia having
seen him,” for it was natural that they were spending some days there,
“in the Temple.” ([Acts 21.27](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#027.md)<span
id="vi.xlvi-p12.10"></span>.) (*c*) Mark the economy (of Providence)
that appeared (in this). (p. 279, note 1) After the (believing) Jews had
been persuaded (concerning him), then it is that those (Jews of Asia)
set upon him in order that those (believing Jews) may not also set upon
him. Help, say they, “ye men of Israel!” as though it were some
(monster) difficult to be caught, and hard to be overcome, that has
fallen into their hands. “All men,” they say, “everywhere, he ceaseth
not to teach;” not here only. And then the accusation (is) more
aggravated by the present circumstances. “And yet more,” say they, “he
has polluted the temple, having brought into it men who are Greeks.”
([Acts 21.28](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#028.md)<span
id="vi.xlvi-p12.11"></span>.) And yet in Christ’s time there “came up
(Greeks) to worship” ([John xii.
20](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#020)<span id="vi.xlvi-p12.12"></span>.md):
true, but here it speaks of Greeks who had no mind to worship. “And they
seized Paul,” etc. ([Acts
21.30-35](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#030.md)<span
id="vi.xlvi-p12.13"></span>.) They no longer wanted laws nor courts of
justice: they also beat him. But he forbore to make his defence then; he
made it afterward: with reason; for they would not even have heard him
then. Pray, why did they cry, “Away with him?” ([Acts
21.36](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#036.md)<span
id="vi.xlvi-p12.14"></span>.) They feared he might escape them. Observe
how submissively Paul speaks to the tribune. “May I speak unto thee?
Then art not thou that Egyptian?” ([Acts
21:37](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#037.md),
[38](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#038)<span id="vi.xlvi-p12.15"></span>..md)
This Egyptian, namely, was a cheat and impostor, and the devil expected
to cast a cloud over (the Gospel) through him, and implicate both Christ
and His Apostles in the charges pertaining to those (imposters): but he
prevailed nothing, nay the truth became even more brilliant, being
nothing defeated by the machinations of the devil, nay rather shining
forth all the more. Since if there had not been impostors, and then
these (Christ and His Apostles) had prevailed, perhaps some one might
have laid hold upon this: but when those impostors did actually appear,
this is the wonder. “In order,” says (the Apostle), “that they which are
approved may be made manifest.” (<span id="vi.xlvi-p12.16"></span>[1
Cor. xi. 19](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#019.md)<span
id="vi.xlvi-p12.17"></span>.) And Gamaliel says, “Before these days
stood up Theudas.” <span id="fr_1054"></span>[1055](#fn_1054.md) Then let
us not grieve that heresies exist, seeing that false Christs wished to
attack even Christ both before this and after; with a view to throw Him
into the shade, but on every occasion we find the truth shining out
transparent. So it was with the Prophets: there were false prophets, and
by contrast with these they shone the more: just as disease enhances
health, and darkness light, and tempest calm. There is no room left for
the Greeks to say that (our teachers) were impostors and mountebanks:
for those (that were such) were exposed. It was the same in the case of
Moses: God suffered the magicians, on purpose that Moses might not be
suspected to be a magician: He let them teach all men to what length
magic can go in making a fantastic show: beyond this point they deceived
not, but themselves confessed their defeat. Impostors do *us* no harm,
rather do us good, if we will apply our mind to the matter. What then,
you will say, if we are partners with them in common estimation? The
estimation is not among us, but with those who have no judgment. Let not
us greatly care for the estimation of the many, nor mind it more than
needs. To God we live, not to men: in heaven we have our conversation,
not on earth: *there* lie the awards and the prizes of our labors,
thence we look for our praises, thence for our crowns. Thus far let us
trouble ourselves about men—that we do not give and afford them a handle
against us. But if, though we afford none, those choose to accuse us
thoughtlessly and without discrimination, let us laugh, not <span
id="fr_1055"></span>[1056](#fn_1055.md) weep. “Provide” thou “things honest
before the Lord and before men” (<span id="vi.xlvi-p14.2"></span>[2 Cor.
viii. 21](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#021.md)<span
id="vi.xlvi-p14.3"></span>): if, though thou provide things honest, that
man derides, give thyself no more concern (for that). Thou hast thy
patterns in the Scriptures. For, saith he, “do I now persuade men or
God?” (<span id="vi.xlvi-p14.4"></span>[Gal. i.
10](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#010)<span id="vi.xlvi-p14.5"></span>.md)
and again, “We persuade men, but we are made manifest unto God.” (<span
id="vi.xlvi-p14.6"></span>[2 Cor. v.
11](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#011)<span id="vi.xlvi-p14.7"></span>..md)
And Christ (spoke) thus of them that take offence: “Let them alone, they
be blind guides of the blind” ([Matt. xv.
14](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#014)<span id="vi.xlvi-p14.8"></span>.md);
and again, “Woe unto you, when all men speak well of you” (<span
id="vi.xlvi-p14.9"></span>[Luke vi.
26](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#026)<span id="vi.xlvi-p14.10"></span>.md):
and again, “Let your works shine, that men may see, and glorify your
Father which is in heaven.” ([Matt. v.
16](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#016)<span id="vi.xlvi-p14.11"></span>..md)
And, “Whoso shall offend one of these little ones, it were better for
him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were drowned in
the depths of the sea.” ([Matt. xviii.
6](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#006)<span id="vi.xlvi-p14.12"></span>..md)

<span id="vi.xlvi-p15"></span>These sayings are not contrary, nay, they
are exceedingly in accord. For when the offence is with us, then woe
unto us, but when not with us, not so. And again, Woe to (that man)
through whom “the name of God is blasphemed.” (<span
id="vi.xlvi-p15.1"></span>[Rom. ii.
24](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#024)<span id="vi.xlvi-p15.2"></span>..md)
How then if I do what is right in anything, but another blasphemes? That
is nothing to me, but only to him: for through him (God) was blasphemed.
“And how is it possible to do what is right in anything, and yet give a
handle to the rest?” Whence will ye that I bring examples—from present,
or from old times? Not to be easily scared (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xlvi-p15.3"></span>ψοφοδεεἵς</span>), shall we speak to the very
point now in hand? Paul judaized in Jerusalem, but in Antioch not so: he
judaized, and they were offended (p. 282, note 3), but those had no
right to be offended. He is said to have saluted both Nero’s cupbearer
and his concubine: <span id="fr_1056"></span>[1057](#fn_1056.md) what,
think ye, must they have said against him because of this? But they had
no right to do so. Since, if he drew them to him for <span
id="fr_1057"></span>[1058](#fn_1057.md) loose living or any wicked acts,
one might well be offended: but if in order to right living, what is
there to be offended at? Let me mention something that happened to one
of my acquaintance. The wrath of God once fell upon (a city), and he
being very young (was) in the order of deacon. The bishop was absent at
the time, and of the presbyters none took thought for the matter, but
indiscriminately they caused in one night immense numbers <span
id="fr_1058"></span>[1059](#fn_1058.md) of people to be baptized all at
once, and they did indiscriminately receive baptism, all of them
ignorant of everything: these he took apart by a hundred or two hundred
together, and discoursed to them, not upon any other subject, but only
on the sacraments, so that the unbaptized also were not allowed to be
present. Many thought he did this because he coveted rule. But he cared
not for that: neither however did he continue the thing for a (longer)
time, but immediately desisted. When then? Was he the cause of the
scandal? I think not. For if indeed he had done this without cause, they
might with reason have ascribed it to him: and so again, if he had
continued to do so. For when aught of what is pleasing to God is
hindered by another’s taking offence, it is right to take no notice: but
then is the time to mind it, when we are not forced because of him to
offend God. For, say, if, while we are discoursing and putting drunkards
to shame (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xlvi-p18.2"></span>σκωπτόντων</span>), any one take offence—am I
to give over speaking? Hear Christ say, “Will ye also go away?” (<span
id="vi.xlvi-p18.3"></span>[John vi.
67](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#067)<span id="vi.xlvi-p18.4"></span>..md)
So then, the right thing is, neither to take no notice, nor to take too
much, of the weakness of the many. Do we not see the physicians acting
thus: how, when it may be done, they humor the whims of their patients,
but when the gratification does harm, then they will not spare? Always
it is good to know the right mean. Many reviled, because a certain
beautiful virgin stayed, and they railed upon those who catechised
(her). What then? Was it their duty to desist for that? By no means. For
let us not look to this only, whether some be offended, but whether they
are justly offended, and <span id="fr_1059"></span>[1060](#fn_1059.md) so
that it is no hurt to ourselves (to give way). “If meat,” saith (Paul),
“offend my brother, I will eat no meat as long as the world lasts.”
(<span id="vi.xlvi-p19.5"></span>[1 Cor. viii.
13](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#013)<span id="vi.xlvi-p19.6"></span>..md)
With reason: for the not eating did (him) no harm. If however it offend
him, that I wish to renounce (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xlvi-p19.7"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xlvi-p19.8"></span>ποτάξασθαι</span>) (the world), it is not
right to mind him. And whom, you will ask, does this offend? Many, to my
knowledge. When therefore the hindrance is a thing indifferent, let (the
thing) be done <span id="fr_1060"></span>[1061](#fn_1060.md) . Else, if we
were to look only to this, many are the things we have to desist from:
just as, on the other hand, if we should despise (all objections), we
have to destroy many (brethren). As in fact Paul also took thought
beforehand concerning offence: “Lest,” he says, “in this liberality
which is administered by us:” for it was attended with no loss (to him)
to obviate an ill surmise. But when we fall into such a necessity as
that great evils should ensue through the other’s taking offence <span
id="fr_1061"></span>[1062](#fn_1061.md) let us pay no heed to that person.
He has to thank himself for it, and we are not now accountable, for it
was not possible to spare him without hurt (to ourselves). Some were
offended, because certain believers sat down to meat in (heathen)
temples. It was not right to sit down: for no harm came of this (their
not doing it). They were offended, because Peter ate with the Gentiles.
But he indeed spared them, but (Paul) <span
id="fr_1062"></span>[1063](#fn_1062.md) not so. On all occasions it
behooves us in following the laws of God to take great pains that we
give no matter of offence; that both ourselves may not have to answer
for it, and may have mercy vouchsafed us from God, by the grace and
loving-kindness of His only-begotten Son, with Whom to the Father and
Holy Ghost together be glory, dominion, honor, now and ever, world
without end. Amen.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1047"></span>[i:1048](1110051.htm#fr_1047.md) <span
id="vi.xlvi-p4.11"></span>

<span id="vi.xlvi-p5"></span> It has been much disputed whether the
charge: “Thou teachest apostacy from Moses,” etc., was true or not.
There certainly was truth in the charge. Paul maintained that the Mosaic
law, as such, was not binding upon Christians. But it was against those
who made it a yoke of bondage upon believers, that he waged a polemic.
Where there was no imposition of the law as necessary to salvation, Paul
in no way antagonized it, but rather trusted to the free working of the
principles of the gospel to gradually accomplish the abolition of its
rites and forms. The truth seems to be that Paul was tolerant of Judaism
where it did not impose burdens upon believers or threaten the
completeness and sufficiency of the gospel; he even accommodated himself
to Jewish requirements, as in shaving his head at Cenchrea and
circumcising Timothy. He never unnecessarily opposed the law of Moses,
but taught that it had been fulfilled in Christ. So far as he
accommodated himself to its ceremonies, it was only that he might remove
prejudice and so win the Jews to Christ.—G.B.S.

<span id="fn_1048"></span>[i:1049](1110051.htm#fr_1048.md) <span

<span id="vi.xlvi-p6"></span> Old text: <span class="Greek"><span

Jerusalem would naturally fall at the same time with that of the Jews
who, like himself, came from the same parts. Mod. text transfers the
comment to the first clause of the verse, “And as the days were about to
be fulfilled: <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xlvi-p6.3"></span>ὅ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xlvi-p6.4"></span>ρα πῶς μάλιστα δὴ αὐτοῖς ἐγχρονίζει</span>,” it
is not easy to see with what meaning.

among the living.” Hence Œcumen. combining this with the explanation in
the text, “It was the custom of the Jews, etc. But some say, That is,
what they say with us,” etc. And so mod. text, “It was a custom of the
Jews to say this against those whom they would condemn, as also in the
case of Christ they appear doing this, and saying, <span

<span id="vi.xlvi-p11"></span> This vow appears to have been the
Nazarite vow described in <span id="vi.xlvi-p11.1"></span>[Num. vi.

taken by the apostle as an accommodation to Jewish prejudices and to
allay the suspicions of the legal party in Jerusalem. This was done upon
the recommendation of James, the “Bishop” of the church, and his
associates. The significance of Paul’s paying the expenses, is, perhaps,
that the period during which the others vow had run was on this
condition reckoned to his account also. It is noticeable that the party
of James distinctly admits that adherence to the legal ceremonies is not
required of the Gentile Christians; it is equally important to notice
that Paul yielded to the advice to take this view, as a concession in a
matter of indifference, since he was living for the time as a Jew among
Jews, that he might give no needless offence and might win the more. It
was not a compromise, but an expedient concession to convictions and
prejudices which it was not wise or necessary to oppose or
increase.—G.B.S.

class="Greek"><span id="vi.xlvi-p12.1"></span>ἁ</span><span

Chrysostom’s view of St. Peter’s dissimulation at Antioch as an
“economy,” is most fully given in his exposition of the passage, *<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xlvi-p12.3"></span>Χομμεντ. ιν

<span id="vi.xlvi-p13"></span> Mod. text adds, “But as for the
*sicarii,* some say they were a kind of robbers, so called from the
swords they bore, which by the Romans are called *sicæ:* others, that
they were of the first sect among the Hebrews. For there are among them
three sects, generally considered (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xlvi-p13.1"></span>αἱρέσεις αἱ γενικαί</span>): Pharisees,
Sadducees, and Essenes who are also called <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xlvi-p13.2"></span>ὅ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xlvi-p13.3"></span>σιοι</span>, for that is the meaning of the
name ‘Essenes,’ on account of their reverend manner of life: but the
same (?) are also called *sicarii,* because of their being zealots.” For
a further illustration of the way in which the modern text was formed,
especially in respect of its use of the *Catena* (see p. 279, note 3),
compare the latter with Œcumenius on this passage. The Catena, namely,
cites from Origen: “Among the Jews are <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xlvi-p13.4"></span>τρεῖς αἱρέσεις γενικαί·</span> Pharisees,
Sadducees, Essenes: these (last) exercise a more reverend manner of
life, being lovers one of another and temperate: whence also they are
called Essenes, i.e. <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xlvi-p13.5"></span>ὅ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xlvi-p13.6"></span>σιοι</span>: but others called them (?)
*sicarii,* i.e. zealots.” (Œcumen. using the Catena, makes a continuous
exposition from Chrys., Origen, and Josephus. Mod. text from the same
materials, interpolates the text of Chrys. as above.

and not with concomitant hurt to ourselves should we give way.” As in

the “weak brothers” were offended <span class="Greek"><span

impediment urged by others against a person’s taking the monastic vows
be a thing indifferent, let him take them. Else, if we were to look to
this only—viz. that this or that man is offended—<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xlvi-p20.7"></span>πολλῶν ἔχομεν

forego or desist from: as on the other hand were we to make it a rule to
despise all considerations of offence, we should have to be the ruin of
many a brother.

persisting in our course is plain—viz. where the other is offended <span

give way would be <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xlvi-p21.2"></span>μετὰ τῆς ἡμετέρας βλαβῆς</span>—then, even
though great evils to him or others result from our not giving way, we
must take no notice of the offence, must allow it no weight.

offence to the Gentile brethren in his company.
