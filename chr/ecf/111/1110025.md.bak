<span id="vi.xx-p1"></span><span class="c9"><span

<span id="vi.xx-p2"></span>[Acts 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#010.md),
[12](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#012.md)<span id="vi.xx-p2.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xx-p3"></span>“And there was a certain disciple at
Damascus, named Ananias; and to him said the Lord in a vision, Ananias.
And he said, Behold, I am here, Lord. And the Lord said unto him, Arise,
and go into the street which is called Straight, and inquire in the
house of Judas for one called Saul, of Tarsus: for, behold, he prayeth,
and hath seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in, and putting his
hand on him, that he might receive his sight.”

<span id="vi.xx-p4"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="vi.xx-p4.1"></span>What</span> may be the reason that He neither
drew any one of high authority and importance, nor caused such to be
forthcoming for the purpose of instructing Paul? <span
id="fr_472"></span>[473](#fn_472.md) It was, because it was not meet that
he should be induced by men, but only by Christ Himself: as in fact this
man taught him nothing, but merely baptized him; for, as soon as
baptized (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xx-p5.5"></span>φωτισθείς</span>), he was to draw upon himself
the grace of the Spirit, by his zeal and exceeding earnestness. And that
Ananias was no very distinguished person, is plain. For, “the Lord,” it
says, “spake unto him in a vision, and Ananias answered and said, Lord,
I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he hath done to Thy
saints at Jerusalem.” ([Acts 9.13](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#013.md)<span
id="vi.xx-p5.6"></span>.) For if he spoke in objection to Him, much more
would he have done so, had He sent an Angel. And this is why, in the
former instance, neither is Philip told what the matter is; but he sees
the Angel, and then the Spirit bids him go near to the chariot. But
observe here how the Lord relieves him of his fear: “He is blind,” saith
He, “and prayeth, and art thou afraid?” In the same way Moses also is
afraid: so that the words betokened that he was afraid, and shrunk from
the task, not that he did not believe. He said,” have heard from many
concerning this man.” What sayest thou? God speaketh, and thou
hesitatest? They did not yet well know the power of Christ. “And here he
hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on Thy
name.” ([Acts 9.14](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#014.md)<span
id="vi.xx-p5.7"></span>.) How was that known? It is likely that they,
being in fear, made minute enquiries. He does not say this, as thinking
that Christ does not know the fact, but, “such being the case, how,”
says he, “can these things be?” As in fact those (in the Gospel) say,
“Who can be saved?”—( [Mark x. 26](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#026.md)<span
id="vi.xx-p5.8"></span>.) This is done, in order that Paul may believe
him that shall come to him: “he hath seen in a vision:” it hath showed
him beforehand: “he prayeth,” saith (the Lord): fear not. And observe,
He speaks not to him of the success achieved: teaching us not to speak
of our achievements. And, <span id="fr_473"></span>[474](#fn_473.md) though
He saw him afraid, for all this He said it not. “Thou shalt not be
disbelieved:” “he hath seen,” saith He, “in a vision a man (named)
Ananias:” for this is why it was “in a vision,” namely, because he was
blind. And not even the exceeding wonderfulness of the thing took
possession of the disciple’s mind, so greatly was he afraid. But
observe: Paul being blind, in this way He restored to sight. “But the
Lord said unto him, Go thy way: for he is a chosen vessel unto Me, to
bear My name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel:
for I will show him how great things he must suffer for My name’s sake.”
([Acts 9:15](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#015.md),
[16](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#016)<span id="vi.xx-p6.10"></span>..md)
“Not only,” saith He, “shall he be a believer, but even a teacher, and
great boldness shall he show: ‘before Gentiles and kings’—such shall be
the spread of the doctrine!—that just as He astonished (him) by the
former, so He may (startle him even more) by the latter. <span
id="fr_474"></span>[475](#fn_474.md) “And Ananias went, and entered into
the house, and laid his hands upon him, and said, Brother Saul”—he
straightway addresses him as a friend by that name—“Jesus, Who appeared
unto thee in the way in which thou camest”—and yet Christ had not told
him this, but he learnt it from the Spirit—“hath sent me unto thee, that
thou mayest receive thy sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost.”
([Acts 9.17](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#017.md)<span
id="vi.xx-p7.10"></span>.) As he said this, he laid his hands upon him.
“And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales.” ([Acts
9.18](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#018)<span id="vi.xx-p7.11"></span>..md)
Some say this was a sign of his blindness. Why did he not blind his eyes
(entirely)? This was more wonderful, that, with his eyes open, he did
not see: ([Acts 9.8](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#008.md)<span
id="vi.xx-p7.12"></span>) which was just his case in respect of the Law,
until <span id="fr_475"></span>[476](#fn_475.md) the Name of Jesus was put
on him. “And he received sight forthwith, and arose, and was baptized.
And having taken food, he recovered strength.” ([Acts
9.19](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#019)<span id="vi.xx-p8.6"></span>..md) He
was faint, therefore, both from his journey and from his fear; both from
hunger, and from dejection of mind. Wishing therefore to deepen his
dejection, He made the man blind until the coming of Ananias: and, that
he might not imagine the blindness to be (only) fancy, this is the
reason of the scales. He needed no other teaching: that which had
befallen was made teaching (to him). “And he was with the disciples
which were at Damascus certain days. And straightway in the synagogues
he preached Jesus, <span id="fr_476"></span>[477](#fn_476.md) that He is
the Son of God.” ([Acts 9.20](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#020.md)<span
id="vi.xx-p9.4"></span>.) See, straightway he was a teacher in the
synagogues. He was not ashamed of the change, was not afraid while the
very things in which he was glorious afore-time, the same he destroyed.
Even <span id="fr_477"></span>[478](#fn_477.md) from his first appearance
on the stage here was a man, death-dealing, ready for deeds of blood:
seest thou what a manifest sign (was here)? And with this very thing, he
put all in fear: for, said they, Hither also is he come for this very
thing. “But all that heard him were amazed, and said: Is not this he
that destroyed them which called on this name in Jerusalem, and came
hither for that intent, that he might bring them bound unto the chief
priests? But Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the
Jews which dwelt at Damascus, proving that this is very Christ.” ([Acts
9:21](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#021.md),
[22](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#022)<span id="vi.xx-p10.4"></span>..md) As
one learned in the Law, he stopped their mouths, and suffered them not
to speak. They thought they were rid of disputation in such matters, in
getting rid of Stephen, and they found another, more vehement than
Stephen. <span id="fr_478"></span>[479](#fn_478.md)

<span id="vi.xx-p12"></span>(Recapitulation.) But let us look at what
relates to Ananias. <span id="fr_479"></span>[480](#fn_479.md) The Lord
said not to him, Converse with him, and catechize him. For if, when He
said, “He prayeth, and hath seen a man laying his hands upon him,”
([Acts 9:11](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#011.md),
[12](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#012)<span id="vi.xx-p13.13"></span>..md)
He did not persuade him, much less had He said this. So that he shall
not disbelieve thee, “he hath seen in a vision.” Observe how in the
former instance neither is Philip told all immediately. Fear not, He
saith: “for this man is a chosen vessel for Me. ([Acts
9.15](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#015)<span id="vi.xx-p13.14"></span>..md)
He more than sufficiently released him of his fear, if the case be so
that this man shall be so zealous in our cause, as even to suffer many
things. And justly he is called “a vessel” (or, instrument)—for reason
shows that evil is not a physical quality: “a vessel of election” (or,
chosen instrument), He saith; for we choose that which is approved. And
let not any imagine, that (Ananias) speaks in unbelief of what was told
him, as imagining that Christ was deceived: far from it! but affrighted
and trembling, he did not even attend to what was said, at hearing the
name of Paul. Moreover, the Lord does not tell that He has blinded him:
at the mention of his name fear had prepossessed his soul: “see,” he
says, “to whom Thou art betraying me: ‘and hither for this very purpose
is he come, to bind all that call upon Thy Name.’ I fear, lest he take
me to Jerusalem: why dost Thou cast me into the mouth of the lion?” He
is terrified, even while he speaks these words; that from every quarter
we may learn the energetic character (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xx-p13.15"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xx-p13.16"></span>ρετήν</span>) of the man. For that these things
should be spoken by Jews, were nothing wonderful: but that these (the
believers) are so terrified, it is a most mighty proof of the power of
God. Both the fear is shown, and the obedience greater after the fear.
For there was indeed need of strength. Since He says, “a vessel of
election,” that thou mayest not imagine that God is to do all, He adds,
“to bear My Name before Gentiles and kings, and the children of Israel.
Ananias has heard what he most desired—that against the Jews also he
will take his stand: this above all gave him courage. “For I,” saith He,
“will show him how great things he must suffer for My Name’s sake.” At
the same time also this is said by way of putting Ananias to the blush:
If he, that was so frantic, shall suffer all things, and thou not
willing even to baptize him! “It is well,” saith he: “let him continue
blind” (this <span id="fr_480"></span>[481](#fn_480.md) is why he says
these words): “he is blind: why dost Thou at all bid me open his eyes,
that he may bind (men) again?” Fear not the future: for that opening of
his eyes he will use not against you, but for you (with reference to
that saying, “That he may receive his sight” ([Acts
9.12](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#012)<span id="vi.xx-p14.6"></span>.md),
these words are spoken): for not only will he do you no harm, but he
“will suffer many things.” And what is wonderful indeed is, <span
id="fr_481"></span>[482](#fn_481.md) that he shall first know “how great
things he shall suffer,” and then shall take the field against the
perils.—“Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus”—he saith not, “Who made thee
blind,” but, “Who appeared with thee in the way, hath sent me unto thee
that thou mayest receive thy sight” ([Acts
9.17](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#017)<span id="vi.xx-p15.7"></span>.md):
observe this man also, how he utters nothing boastful, but just as Peter
said in the case of the lame man, “Why look ye on us, as though by our
own power or holiness we had made him to walk,” ([Acts
3.12](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#012)<span id="vi.xx-p15.8"></span>.md) so
here also he saith, “Jesus, Who appeared unto thee.” *(b)* Or, <span
id="fr_482"></span>[483](#fn_482) (he saith it.md) that the other may
believe: and he saith not, He that was crucified, the Son of God, He
that doeth wonders: but what? “He that appeared unto thee:” (speaking)
from what the other knew: as Christ also added no more, neither said, I
am Jesus, the Crucified, the Risen: but what? “Whom thou persecutest.”
Ananias said not, “The persecuted,” that he may not seem as it were to
rave over him (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xx-p16.9"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xx-p16.10"></span>πενθουσί& 139·ν</span>), to deride him, “Who
appeared unto thee in the way:” and yet He did not (visibly) appear, but
was seen by the things done. And immediately he added, wishing to draw a
veil over the accusation: “That thou mayest receive thy sight.” I came
not to reprove the past, but to bestow the gift: “that thou mayest
receive thy sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost.” *(a)* With hands
laid on, he spake these words. “And immediately there fell from his
eyes,” etc. ([Acts 9.18](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#018.md)<span
id="vi.xx-p16.11"></span>): a double blindness is removed.—And why saith
it, “Having taken food, he was strengthened?” ([Acts
9.19](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#019)<span id="vi.xx-p16.12"></span>..md)
Because they that are in such case become relaxed: he had no heart to
partake of food before, until he obtained the mighty gifts. *(c)* It
seems to me, that both Paul and Cornelius, at the very instant when the
words were spoken, received the Spirit. And yet (in this case) the giver
was no great one. So true is it, that there was naught of man’s in the
things done, nor aught was done by man, but God was present, the Doer of
these things. And at the same time (the Lord) both teaches him to think
modestly of himself, in that He does not bring him to the Apostles who
were so admired, and shows that there is nothing of man here. He was not
filled, however, with the Spirit which works signs: that in this way
also his faith might be shown; for he wrought no miracles. “And
straightway,” it says, “in the synagogues he preached Jesus”—([Acts
9.20](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#020)<span id="vi.xx-p16.13"></span>.md)
not that He is risen—not this: no, nor that He liveth: but what?
immediately he strictly expounded the doctrine—“that this is the Son of
God. And all that heard him were amazed,” etc. ([Acts
9.21](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#021)<span id="vi.xx-p16.14"></span>..md)
They were reduced to utter incredulity. And yet they ought not to have
wondered only, but to worship and reverence. “Is not this he,” etc. He
had not merely been a persecutor, but “destroyed them which called on
this Name”—they did not say, “on Jesus;” for hatred, they could not bear
even to hear His name—and what is more marvellous still, “and came
hither for this purpose,” etc. “We cannot say, that he associated with
the Apostles before.” See by how many (witnesses) he is confessed to
have been of the number of the enemies! But Paul not only was not
confounded by these things, nor hid his face for shame, but “increased
the more in strength, and confounded the Jews” ([Acts
9.22](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#022)<span id="vi.xx-p16.15"></span>.md),
i.e. put them to silence, left them nothing to say for themselves,
“proving, that this is very Christ.” “Teaching,” it says: for this man
was a teacher.

<span id="vi.xx-p17"></span>“And after that many days were fulfilled,
the Jews took counsel to kill him.” <span
id="fr_483"></span>[484](#fn_483.md) ([Acts
9.23](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#023)<span id="vi.xx-p18.10"></span>..md)
The Jews again resort to that valid argument (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xx-p18.11"></span>ἰ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xx-p18.12"></span>σχυρὸν συλλογισμόν</span>) of theirs, not now
seeking false-accusers and false-witnesses; they cannot wait for these
now: but what do they? They set about it by themselves. For as they see
the affair on the increase, they do not even use the form of a trial.
“But their laying await was known of Saul. And they watched the gates
day and night to kill him.” ([Acts
9.24](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#024)<span id="vi.xx-p18.13"></span>..md)
For this was more intolerable to them than the miracles which had taken
place—than the five thousand, the three thousand, than everything, in
short. And observe him, how he is delivered, not by (miraculous) grace,
but by man’s wisdom—not as the apostles were—(<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xx-p18.14"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xx-p18.15"></span>κεἴνοι</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xx-p18.16"></span>,</span> [Acts
5.19](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#019)<span id="vi.xx-p18.17"></span>.md)
that thou mayest learn the energetic (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xx-p18.18"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xx-p18.19"></span>ρετὴν</span>) character of the man, how he
shines even without miracles. “Then the disciples took him by night,”
that the affair might not be suspected, “and let him down by the wall in
a basket.” <span id="fr_484"></span>[485](#fn_484.md) ([Acts
9.25](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#025)<span id="vi.xx-p19.7"></span>..md)
What then? having escaped such a danger, does he flee? By no means, but
goes where he kindled them to greater rage.

<span id="vi.xx-p20"></span>(Recapitulation, [Acts
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#020.md),
[21](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#021)<span id="vi.xx-p20.1"></span>..md)
“And straightway in the synagogues he preached Jesus”—for he was
accurate in the faith—“that this is the Son of God. But all that heard
him were amazed,” etc., for indeed it was incredible. “But Saul
increased,” etc. Therefore “after many days” this happens: viz. the Jews
“took counsel to kill him. And their laying await was known of Saul.”
([Acts 22-24](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#000.md)<span
id="vi.xx-p20.2"></span>.) What does this mean? It is likely that for
awhile he did not choose to depart thence, though many, perhaps,
besought him; but when he learnt it, then he permitted his disciples:
for he had disciples immediately.

<span id="vi.xx-p21"></span>“Then the disciples,” etc. ([Acts
9.25](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#025)<span id="vi.xx-p21.1"></span>..md)
Of this occurrence he says: “The ethnarch of Aretas the king kept the
city of the Damascenes with a garrison, desiring to apprehend me.”
(<span id="vi.xx-p21.2"></span>[2 Cor. xi.
32](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#032)<span id="vi.xx-p21.3"></span>..md) But
observe the Writer here, <span id="fr_485"></span>[486](#fn_485.md) that he
does not tell the story ambitiously, and so as to show what an important
person Paul was, saying, “For they stirred up the king,” and so forth:
but only, “Then the disciples took him by night, and let him down by the
wall—in a basket:” for they sent him out alone, and none with him. And
it was well they did this: the consequence being, that he showed himself
to the Apostles in Jerusalem. Now they sent him out, as bound to provide
for his safety by flight: but he did just the contrary—he leaped into
the midst of those who were mad against him. This it is to be on fire,
this to be fervent indeed! From that day forth he knew all the commands
which the Apostles had heard: “Except a man take up his cross, and
follow Me.” ([Matt. x. 38](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#038.md)<span
id="vi.xx-p22.12"></span>.) The very fact that he had been slower to
come than the rest made him more zealous: for “to whom much is forgiven”
(<span id="vi.xx-p22.13"></span>[Luke vii.
47](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#047)<span id="vi.xx-p22.14"></span>.md) the
same will love more, so that the later he came, the more he loved: \* \*
\* <span id="fr_486"></span>[487](#fn_486.md) and having done ten thousand
wrongs, he thought he could never do enough to cast the former deeds
into the shade. “Proving” ([Acts
9.22](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#022)<span id="vi.xx-p23.12"></span>.md),
it says: i.e. with mildness teaching. And observe, they did not say to
him, Thou art he that destroyed: why art thou changed? for they were
ashamed: but they said it to themselves. For he would have said to them,
This very thing ought to teach you, as in fact he does thus plead in his
speech before Agrippa. Let us imitate this, man: let us bear our souls
in our hands ready to confront all dangers.—(That he fled from Damascus)
this was no cowardice: <span id="fr_487"></span>[488](#fn_487.md) he
preserved himself for the preaching. Had he been a coward, he would not
have gone to Jerusalem, would not immediately have commenced teaching:
he would have abated somewhat of his vehemence: for he had been taught
by the fate of Stephen. He was no coward, but he was also prudent (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xx-p24.1"></span>οἰκονομικός</span>) (in
husbanding himself). Wherefore he thought it no great thing to die for
the Gospel’s sake, unless he should do this to great advantage: willing
not even to see Christ, Whom most of all he longed to see, while the
work of his stewardship among men was not yet complete. ([Phil.
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#023.md),
[24](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#024)<span id="vi.xx-p24.2"></span>.md).
Such ought to be the soul of a Christian. From <span
id="fr_488"></span>[489](#fn_488.md) his first appearance from the very
outset, the character of Paul declared itself: nay even before this,
even in the things which he did “not according to knowledge” ([Rom. x.
2](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#002)<span id="vi.xx-p25.1"></span>.md), it
was not by man’s reasoning that he was moved to act as he did. <span
id="fr_489"></span>[490](#fn_489.md) For if, so long afterwards, he was
content not to depart, much more at the beginning of his trading voyage,
when he had but just left the harbor! Many things Christ leaves to be
done by (ordinary) human wisdom, that we may learn that (his disciples)
were men, that it was not all everywhere to be done by grace: for
otherwise they would have been mere motionless logs: but in many things
they managed matters themselves.—This is not less than martyrdom,—to
shrink from no suffering for the sake of the salvation of the many.
Nothing so delights God. Again will I repeat what I have often said: and
I repeat it, because I do exceedingly desire it: as Christ also did the
same, when discoursing concerning forgiveness: “When ye pray, forgive if
ye have aught against any man:” (<span id="vi.xx-p26.5"></span>[Mark xi.
25](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#025)<span id="vi.xx-p26.6"></span>..md) and
again to Peter He said, “I say not unto thee, Forgive until seven times,
but until seventy-times seven.” ([Matt. xviii.
22](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#022)<span id="vi.xx-p26.7"></span>..md) And
Himself in fact forgives the transgressions against Him. So do we also,
because we know that this is the very goal of Christianity, continually
discourse thereof. Nothing is more frigid than a Christian, who cares
not for the salvation of others. Thou canst not here plead poverty: for
she that cast down the two mites, shall be thine accuser. (<span
id="vi.xx-p26.8"></span>[Luke xxi.
1](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#001)<span id="vi.xx-p26.9"></span>..md) And
Peter said, “Silver and gold have I none.” (<span
id="vi.xx-p26.10"></span>[Acts iii.
6](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#006)<span id="vi.xx-p26.11"></span>..md) And
Paul was so poor, that he was often hungered, and wanted necessary food.
Thou canst not plead lowness of birth: for they too were ignoble men,
and of ignoble parents. Thou canst not allege want of education: for
they too were “unlearned men.” (<span id="vi.xx-p26.12"></span>[Acts iv.
13](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#013)<span id="vi.xx-p26.13"></span>..md)
Even if thou be a slave therefore and a runaway slave, thou canst
perform thy part: for such was Onesimus: yet see to what Paul calls him,
and to how great honor he advances him: “that he may communicate with
me,” he says, “in my bonds.” (Philem. v. 13<span
id="vi.xx-p26.14"></span>.) Thou canst not plead infirmity: for such was
Timothy, having often infirmities; for, says the apostle, “Use a little
wine for thy stomach’s sake, and thine often infirmities.” ([1 Tim. v.
23](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#023)<span id="vi.xx-p26.15"></span>..md)
Every one can profit his neighbor, if he will fulfil his part. See ye
not the unfruitful trees, how strong they are, how fair, how large also,
and smooth, and of great height? But if we had a garden; we should much
rather have pomegranates, or fruitful olive trees: for the others are
for delight to the eye, not for profit, which in them is but small. Such
are those men who only consider their own interest: nay, not such even
since these persons are fit only for burning: whereas those trees are
useful both for building and for the safety of those within. Such too
were those Virgins, chaste indeed, and decent, and modest, but
profitable to none ([Matt. xxv. 1](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#001.md)<span
id="vi.xx-p26.16"></span>) wherefore they are burned. Such are they who
have not nourished Christ. For observe that none of those are charged
with particular sins of their own, with fornication, for instance, or
with perjury; in short, with no sin but the having been of no use to
another. Such was he who buried his talent, showing indeed a blameless
life, but not being useful to another. ([Matt.
25.25](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#025)<span id="vi.xx-p26.17"></span>..md)
How can such an one be a Christian? Say, if the leaven being mixed up
with the flour did not change the whole into its own nature, would such
a thing be leaven? Again, if a perfume shed no sweet odor on those who
approach it, could we call it a perfume? Say not, “It is impossible for
me to induce others (to become Christians)”—for if thou art a Christian,
it is impossible but that it should be so. For as the natural properties
of things cannot be gainsaid, so it is here: the thing is part of the
very nature of the Christian. Do not insult God. To say, that the sun
cannot shine, would be to insult Him: to say that a Christian cannot do
good, is to insult God, and call Him a liar. For it is easier for the
sun not to give heat, nor to shine, than for the Christian not to send
forth light: it is easier for the light to be darkness, than for this to
be so. Tell me not that it is impossible: the contrary is the
impossible. Do not insult God. If we once get our own affairs in a right
state, the other will certainly follow as a natural and necessary
consequence. It is not possible for the light of a Christian to be hid;
not possible for a lamp so conspicuous as that to be concealed. Let us
not be careless. For, as the profit from virtue reaches both to
ourselves, and to those who are benefited by it: so from vice there is a
two-fold loss, reaching both to ourselves, and to those who are injured
by it. Let there be (if you will) some private man, who has suffered
numberless ills from some one, and let no one take his part, yet let
that man still return good offices; what teaching so mighty as this?
What words, or what exhortations could equal it? What wrath were it not
enough to extinguish and soften? Knowing therefore these things, let us
hold fast to virtue, as knowing that it is not possible to be saved
otherwise, than by passing through this present life in doing these good
works, that we may also obtain the good things which are to come,
through the grace and mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ, with Whom to the
Father together with the Holy Spirit be glory, might, honor, now and
ever, world without end. Amen.

<span id="vi.xx-p11"></span> The narratives given by Paul himself of his
conversion in [Acts 22:0](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#000.md), [Acts
26:0](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#000.md)<span
id="vi.xx-p11.1"></span>[Acts
xxii.](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#000.md)<span id="vi.xx-p11.2"></span>
and Acts xxvi. as well as allusion to the subjects in his epistles,
present some harmonistic difficulties, which have, however, been greatly
exaggerated by a criticism which is unfavorable to the historical
character of the Acts. The constant factors in all the accounts are: the
light from heaven, the voice of Jesus and Saul’s answer, and the solemn
charge commissioning Saul to bear the name of Christ to the Gentiles. In
[Acts xxvi](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#000.md)<span
id="vi.xx-p11.3"></span>. the interview with Ananias is omitted; in
[Acts 22](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#000.md)<span
id="vi.xx-p11.4"></span>. it is narrated, but the occasion of Ananias’
going to Saul is not given; in [Acts
9](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#000.md)<span id="vi.xx-p11.5"></span>. the
Lord is represented as speaking to him and bidding him go, and it is
affirmed that at the same time Saul has a vision of his coming. In [Acts
22](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#000.md)<span id="vi.xx-p11.6"></span>. the
address of Ananias is considerably more extended than in [Acts
9](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#000.md)<span id="vi.xx-p11.7"></span>. Some
minor points of difference have been noted, as: in [Acts
9.7](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#007.md)<span id="vi.xx-p11.8"></span> it
is said that Saul’s companions heard the voice but saw no one, while in
[Acts 22.9](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#009.md)<span
id="vi.xx-p11.9"></span>, it is said that they saw the light but heard
not the voice of Him who spoke. The discrepancy is resolved by many by
translating <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xx-p11.10"></span>ἤ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xx-p11.11"></span>κουσαν</span>([Acts
22.9](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#009)<span id="vi.xx-p11.12"></span>.md)
“understood”—an admissable sense (so, Lechler, Hackett, Lange). It is
certainly an unwarranted criticism which rejects the common matter of
the various narratives upon the ground of such incidental variations in
the traditions in which a great and mysterious experience has been
preserved.—G.B.S.

<span id="fn_479"></span>[i:480](1110025.htm#fr_479.md) <span
id="vi.xx-p12.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xx-p13"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xx-p13.1"></span>Σκεῦος δὲ καλεῖται δικαίως· δεικνύντος τοῦ λόγου
ὅτι οὐκ ἔστι φυσικὴ ἡ κακία· σκεῦος, φησὶν, ἐκλογῆς· τὸ δόκιμον γὰρ
ἐκλεγόμεθα</span>. A. B. C. N. i.e. “Justly is he called a <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xx-p13.2"></span>σκεῦος</span>, for he is
well-fitted for the work of Christ by his energy and earnestness. These
need but to be turned to the right objects. It is contrary to right
reason to say, that evil is a physical quality or essence, and therefore
unchangeable. (See this argued *Hom.* lix. *in Matt.* p. 596.) A fit
implement, therefore, and of no common kind: a <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xx-p13.3"></span>σκεῦος ἐκλογῆς</span>, of all others to be
chosen, because of its approved suitableness for the purpose.” Thus St.
Chrysostom constantly interprets this expression. *Hom.* xviii. *in
Rom.* §6 t. ix. 638. “When the stars were created, the Angels admired:
but this man Christ Himself admired, saying, A chosen vessel is this man
to Me!” *Comm. in* c. 1. *Gal.* §9, t. x. 674 “Called me by His grace.
Yet God saith, that He called Him, because of his virtue, (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xx-p13.4"></span>διὰ τὴν ἀρετήν</span>,)
saying, A chosen vessel, etc.: i.e. fit to do service, and do a great
work…But Paul himself everywhere ascribes it all to grace.” *Hom.* iii.
*in* 1 *Tim.* §1, t. xi. 562. “God, foreknowing what he would be before
he began to preach, saith, A chosen vessel etc. For as they who in war
bear the royal standard, the *labarum* as we call it, have need of much
skill and bravery not to deliver it into the enemy’s hands, so they that
bear the name of Christ,” etc. And *de Compunct. ad Demetr. lib.* i. §9,
t. i. 138. “Since grace will have our part, (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xx-p13.5"></span>τὰ παρ᾽ ἡμῶν ζητεῖ</span>,) therefore some it
follows and abides with, from some it departs, and to the rest it never
even reaches. And to show that God first examined well the bent of the
will (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xx-p13.6"></span>προαίρεσις</span>,) and thereupon gave the grace
before this blessed man had done aught wonderful, hear what the Lord
saith of him: A chosen vessel,” etc.—The modern text: “And having said
<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xx-p13.7"></span>Σκεῦος</span>, so as
to show that the evil in him (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xx-p13.8"></span>ἡ</span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xx-p13.9"></span>κακία αὐτοῦ</span>) is not physical, He adds,
<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xx-p13.10"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xx-p13.11"></span>κλογῆς</span>, to declare
that he is also approved; for,” etc.—Œcumen. <span class="Greek"><span

<span id="vi.xx-p14"></span> <span class="Greek"><span

objection, ([Acts 9.13](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#013.md)<span
id="vi.xx-p14.2"></span>) in fact comes to this: this was the feeling
which prompted his words. The innovator substitutes, <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xx-p14.3"></span>διὰ τοῦτο νῦν ἥμερος,
ὅτι</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xx-p14.4"></span>…</span>“therefore is he now gentle, because he
is blind:” E. Edd.—The meaning is; “In saying, ‘I will show him how much
he shall suffer,’ etc. the Lord rebukes Ananias’ reluctance to baptize
him, and restore his sight: his answer, ‘Lord, I have heard,’ etc. was
in fact as good as saying, Let him remain blind, it is better so.” The
parenthetic, <span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xx-p14.5"></span>πρὸς τὸ,
῞Ινα ἀναβλέψῃ, ταῦτα εἴρηται</span>, looks like a marginal note of one
who did not perceive the connection.—E. makes it, “To that saying, ‘That
he may receive his sight,’ let this be added.”

<span id="vi.xx-p16"></span> In the <span class="c14"><span

*b, a, c,* occur in the order *a, b, c.* The clause <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xx-p16.2"></span>ἢ</span> <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xx-p16.3"></span>ὥστε πιστεῦσαι

so that he (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xx-p16.5"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span

<span id="fn_483"></span>[i:484](1110025.htm#fr_483.md) <span
id="vi.xx-p17.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xx-p18"></span> It is noticeable that in [Acts
22.17](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#017.md)<span id="vi.xx-p18.1"></span>,
Paul is reported as connecting his going to Jerusalem directly with the
narrative of his conversion, while in <span
id="vi.xx-p18.2"></span>[Gal. 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#016.md),
[17](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#017.md)<span id="vi.xx-p18.3"></span> he
states that it was not until three years after his conversion that he
went up to Jerusalem. The various notices can only be matched together
on the view that the coming to Jerusalem mentioned in [Acts
9.26](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#026.md)<span id="vi.xx-p18.4"></span> was
the same as that of [Gal. i. 18](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#018.md)<span
id="vi.xx-p18.5"></span>, and that this occurred about three years after
his conversion. The <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xx-p18.6"></span>ἡ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xx-p18.7"></span>μέραι ἱκαναί</span> of [Acts
9.23](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#023.md)<span id="vi.xx-p18.8"></span>
must therefore include the time spent in Arabia ([Gal. i.
17](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#017)<span id="vi.xx-p18.9"></span>.md).,
after which Paul must have returned to Damascus, before going up to
Jerusalem. In this way the narratives can be harmonized without
admitting a contradiction (as Baur, Zeller, De Wette); it is probable,
however, that Luke did not know of the visit to Arabia, but connected
Paul’s going to Jerusalem closely with his conversion.—G.B.S.

<span id="fn_484"></span>[i:485](1110025.htm#fr_484.md) <span
id="vi.xx-p18.20"></span>

<span id="vi.xx-p19"></span> The best textual authorities (A. B. C.
<span class="Hebrew"><span id="vi.xx-p19.1"></span>א</span>,) and
critics (Tisch. W. and H., Lechler, Meyer, Gloag) here read: “his
(Saul’s) disciples,” So R.V.…The reference is to the band of converts
whom he had been successful in winning at Damascus. In Paul’s own
narrative of his escape from Damascus (<span id="vi.xx-p19.2"></span>[2
Cor. xi. 33](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#033.md)<span
id="vi.xx-p19.3"></span>) he states more specifically that he was let
down “*through a window, through the wall.*” This may have been either
through the window of a house overhanging the wall, or through a window
in the face of some portion of the wall (Cf. <span
id="vi.xx-p19.4"></span>[Josh. ii.
15](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#015.md)<span id="vi.xx-p19.5"></span>; [1

but only (saying) that they stirred up the king.” But he does not say
it, and his not saying it is the very thing which Chrys. commends: <span

<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xx-p22.11"></span>φησὶν</span> here is
put hypothetically, “as if he had said,” or “when he might have said.”
