<span id="vi.xvii-p1"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vi.xvii-p1.1"></span>Homily XVII.</span>

<span id="vi.xvii-p2"></span>[Acts VII.
35](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#035.md)<span id="vi.xvii-p2.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xvii-p3"></span>“This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who
made thee a ruler and a judge over us? the same did God send to be a
ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the Angel which appeared to him in
the bush.”

<span id="vi.xvii-p4"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="vi.xvii-p4.1"></span>This</span> is very suitable to the matter in
hand. “This Moses,” he says. “This,” the man who had been in danger of
losing his life; the man who had been set at naught by them; “this” the
man whom they had declined: “this” same, God having raised up, sent unto
them. “Whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler?” just as they
themselves (the hearers) said, “We have no king, but Cæsar.” ([John xix.
15](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#015)<span id="vi.xvii-p4.2"></span>..md) He
here shows also, that what was then done, was done by Christ. “The same
did God send by the hand of the Angel,” who said unto him, “I am the God
of Abraham.” “This” same Moses, he says,—and observe how he points to
his renown—“this” same Moses, he says, “brought them out, after that he
had showed wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, and in the Red sea,
and in the wilderness forty years. This is that Moses, which said unto
the children of Israel, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto
you of your brethren, like unto me” ([Acts
7:36](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#036.md),
[37](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#037)<span id="vi.xvii-p4.3"></span>.md):
set at naught like me. Him, likewise, Herod wished to kill, and in Egypt
He found preservation just as it was with the former, even when He was a
babe, He was aimed at for destruction. “This is he, that was in the
Church in the wilderness with the Angel which spake to him in the mount
Sina, and with our fathers: who received the lively oracles to give unto
us.” ([Acts 7.38](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#038.md)<span
id="vi.xvii-p4.4"></span>.) Again no mention of temple, none of
sacrifice. “With the Angel,” it says, “he received the lively oracles to
give unto the fathers.” It shows, that he not only wrought miracles, but
also gave a law, as Christ did. Just as Christ first works miracles, and
then legislates: so did Moses. But they did not hear him, keeping their
disobedience, even after the miracles: “To whom,” he says, “our fathers
would not obey:” ([Acts 7.39](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#039.md)<span
id="vi.xvii-p4.5"></span>) after the wonders done in those forty years.
And not only so, but just the contrary: “but thrust him from them, and
in their hearts turned back again into Egypt. Saying unto Aaron, Make us
gods to go before us; for as for this Moses, which brought us out of the
land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him. And they made a calf in
those days, and offered sacrifice unto the idol, and rejoiced in the
works of their own hands. Then God turned, and gave them up to worship
the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the Prophets, O ye
house of Israel, have ye offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices by
the space of forty years in the wilderness? Yea, ye took up the
tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, figures which ye
made to worship them: and I will carry you away beyond Babylon.” ([Acts
7:40](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#040.md),
[43](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#043)<span id="vi.xvii-p4.6"></span>..md)
The expression, “gave them up,” means, He suffered. “Our fathers had the
tabernacle of witness in the wilderness, as he had appointed, speaking
unto Moses, that he should make it according to the fashion he had
seen.” ([Acts 7.44](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#044.md)<span
id="vi.xvii-p4.7"></span>.) Even when there was a Tabernacle, yet there
were no sacrifices. “Did ye offer unto Me slain beasts and sacrifices?”
([Amos v. 25](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#025.md)<span
id="vi.xvii-p4.8"></span>.) There was “the tabernacle of witness,” and
yet it profited them nothing, but they were consumed. But neither
before, nor afterwards, did the miracles profit them aught. “Which also,
our fathers that came after brought in.” Seest thou, how the holy place
is there wherever God may be? For to this end also he says, “in the
wilderness,” to compare place with place. Then the benefit (conferred
upon them): And our fathers that came after brought it in with Jesus
into the possession of the Gentiles, whom God drave out before the face
of our fathers, unto the days of David; who found favor before God, and
desired to find a tabernacle for the God of Jacob. ([Acts
7:45](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#045.md),
[46](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#046)<span id="vi.xvii-p4.9"></span>..md)
David “desired to find favor:” and he builded not, he, the wonderful,
the great; but the castaway, Solomon. “But Solomon,” it says, “built Him
an house. Howbeit the Most High dwelleth not in (places) made with
hands.” ([Acts 7.47-50](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#047.md)<span
id="vi.xvii-p4.10"></span>.) This was shown indeed already by what had
been before said: but it is shown also by the voice of a prophet; “What
house will ye build for Me? saith the Lord God. As saith the prophet,
Heaven is my throne, and earth is my footstool: what house will ye build
for me? saith the Lord: or what is the place of my rest? Hath not my
hand made all these things?” (<span id="vi.xvii-p4.11"></span>[Isa.
66:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#001.md),
[2](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#002)<span id="vi.xvii-p4.12"></span>..md)

<span id="vi.xvii-p5"></span>Marvel not, he says, if they on whom Christ
confers His benefits refuse His kingdom, seeing in the case of Moses it
was just the same. (Recapitulation). “He brought them out;” and rescued
them not in a general way, but also while they were in the wilderness.
“Wonders and signs,” etc. ([Acts
7.35-50](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#035.md)<span
id="vi.xvii-p5.1"></span>.) Do you mark that they themselves (Stephen’s
hearers) are concerned in those old miracles also? “This is that Moses:”
([Acts 7.37](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#037.md)<span
id="vi.xvii-p5.2"></span>) he, that conversed with God; he, that had
been saved out of situations so strange and wonderful; he, that wrought
so great works, and had so great power. \[“Which said unto the children
of Israel, A prophet,” etc.\] He shows, that the prophecy must by all
means be fulfilled, and that Moses is not opposed to Him. <span
id="fr_385"></span>[386](#fn_385.md) “This is he that was in the Church in
the wilderness, and, that said unto the children of Israel.” ([Acts
7.38](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#038)<span id="vi.xvii-p6.3"></span>..md)
Do you mark that thence comes the root, and that “salvation is from the
Jews?” ([John iv. 22](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#022.md)<span
id="vi.xvii-p6.4"></span>.) “With the Angel,” it says, “which spake unto
him.” (<span id="vi.xvii-p6.5"></span>[Rom. xi.
16](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#016)<span id="vi.xvii-p6.6"></span>..md)
Lo, again he affirms that it was He (Christ) that gave the Law, seeing
Moses was with “Him” in the Church in the wilderness. <span
id="fr_386"></span>[387](#fn_386.md) And here he puts them in mind of a
great marvel, of the things done in the Mount: “Who received living
oracles to give unto us.” On all occasions Moses is wonderful, and (so)
when need was to legislate. What means the expression, “Living oracles”
(<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xvii-p7.12"></span>λόγια</span>)?
Those, whereof the end was shown by words (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xvii-p7.13"></span>διὰ λόγων</span>): in other words, he means
the prophecies. <span id="fr_387"></span>[388](#fn_387.md) Then follows the
charge, in the first instance, against the patriarchs \[after\], the
“signs and wonders,” after the receiving of the “lively oracles: To
whom,” he says, “our fathers would not obey.” ([Acts
7.39](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#039)<span id="vi.xvii-p8.4"></span>..md)
But concerning those, Ezekiel says that they are not “living;” as when
he says, “And I gave you statutes that are not good.” (<span
id="vi.xvii-p8.5"></span>[Ezek. xx.
25](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#025)<span id="vi.xvii-p8.6"></span>..md) It
is with reference to those that he says, “Living. But thrust him from
them, and in their hearts turned back to Egypt”—the place where they
groaned, where they cried, whence they called upon God. “And said unto
Aaron, Make us gods which shall go before us.” ([Acts
7.40](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#040)<span id="vi.xvii-p8.7"></span>..md)
O the folly! “Make,” say they; “that they may go before us.” Whither?
“Into Egypt.” <span id="fr_388"></span>[389](#fn_388.md) See how hard they
were to tear away from the customs of Egypt! What sayest thou? What, not
wait for him that brought thee out, but flee the benefit, and deny the
Benefactor? And mark how insulting they are: “For as for this Moses,”
they say:—“which brought us out of the land of Egypt” nowhere the name
of God: instead of that, they ascribed all to Moses. Where <span
id="fr_389"></span>[390](#fn_389) they ought to give thanks (to God.md),
they bring Moses forward: where it was, to do as the Law bade them, they
no longer make account of Moses. “We know not what is become of him.”
And yet he told them that he was going up to receive the Law: and they
had not patience to wait forty days. “Make us gods”—they <span
id="fr_390"></span>[391](#fn_390.md) did not say, “a God.”—And yet one may
well wonder at this, that they do not even know.—“And they made a calf
in those days, and offered sacrifices unto the idol, and rejoiced in the
works of their own hands” ([Acts
7.41](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#041)<span id="vi.xvii-p11.1"></span>.md):
for which they ought to have hid their faces. What wonder that ye know
not Christ, seeing ye knew not Moses, and God Who was manifested by such
wonders? But they not only knew Him not: they also insulted in another
way, by their idol making. “Then God turned, and gave them up to worship
the host of heaven” ([Acts 7.42](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#042.md)<span
id="vi.xvii-p11.2"></span>.) Hence these same “customs” date their
origin, hence the sacrifices: they were themselves the first that made
sacrifices to their idols! For that is why it is marked, <span
id="fr_391"></span>[392](#fn_391.md) “They made a calf in Horeb, and
offered sacrifices to the idol:” seeing that, before this the name of
sacrifice is nowhere mentioned, but only lively ordinances, and “lively
oracles. And rejoiced”—that is the reason for the feasts. (<span
id="vi.xvii-p12.10"></span>[Exod.
32:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#005.md),
[6](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#006)<span id="vi.xvii-p12.11"></span>..md)
“As it is written in the Book of the Prophets”—and observe, he does not
cite the text without a purpose, but shows by it that there is no need
of sacrifices; saying: “Did ye offer slain beasts and sacrifice to
Me?”—He lays an emphasis on this word (to Me?). “Ye cannot say that it
was from sacrificing to Me, that ye proceeded to sacrifice to them:—“by
the space of forty years:” and this too, “in the wilderness,” where He
had most signally shown Himself their Protector. “Yea, ye took up the
tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan: images which ye
made to worship them.” <span id="fr_392"></span>[393](#fn_392.md) The cause
of sacrifices! “And I will carry you away beyond Babylon.” ([Acts
7.43](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#043)<span id="vi.xvii-p13.9"></span>..md)
Even the captivity, an impeachment of their wickedness! “But a
Tabernacle,” say you, “there was (the Tabernacle) ‘of Witness.’” ([Acts
7.44](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#044.md)<span
id="vi.xvii-p13.10"></span>.) (Yes,) this is why it was: that they
should have God for Witness: this was all. “According to the fashion,”
it says, “that was shown thee on the mount:” so <span
id="fr_393"></span>[394](#fn_393.md) that on the mount was the Original.
And this Tabernacle, moreover, “in the wilderness,” was carried about,
and not locally fixed. And he calls it, “Tabernacle of witness:” i.e.
(for witness) of the miracles, of the statutes. <span
id="fr_394"></span>[395](#fn_394.md) This is the reason why both it and
those (the fathers) had no Temple. “As He had appointed, that spake unto
Moses, that he should make it according to the fashion that he had
seen.” Again, it was none other than He (Christ) that gave the fashion
itself. “Until the days of David” ([Acts
7.45](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#045.md)<span
id="vi.xvii-p15.14"></span>): and there was no temple! And yet the
Gentiles also had been driven out: for that is why he mentions this:
“Whom God drave out,” he says, “before the face of our fathers. Whom He
drave out,” he says: and even then, no Temple! And so many wonders, and
no mention of a Temple! So that, although first there is a Tabernacle,
yet nowhere a Temple. “Until the days of David,” he says: even David,
and no Temple! “And he sought to find favor before God” ([Acts
7.46](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#046.md)<span
id="vi.xvii-p15.15"></span>): and built not:—so far was the Temple from
being a great matter! “But Solomon built Him an house.” ([Acts
7.47](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#047.md)<span
id="vi.xvii-p15.16"></span>.) They thought Solomon was great: but that
he was not better than his father, nay not even equal to him, is
manifest. “Howbeit the Most High dwelleth not in temples made with
hands; as saith the prophet, Heaven is My throne, and earth is My
footstool.” ([Acts 7:48](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#048.md),
[49](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#049)<span id="vi.xvii-p15.17"></span>..md)
Nay, not even these are worthy of God, forasmuch as they are made,
seeing they are creatures, the works of His hand. See how he leads them
on by little and little (showing) that not even these are to be
mentioned. And again the prophecy says openly, “What house will ye build
Me?” etc. ([Acts 7.50](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#050.md)<span
id="vi.xvii-p15.18"></span>.)

<span id="vi.xvii-p16"></span>What is the reason that at this point he
speaks in the tone of invective (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xvii-p16.1"></span>καταφορικὥς</span>)? Great was his boldness of
speech, when at the point to die: for in fact I think he knew that this
was the case. “Ye stiffnecked,” he says, “and uncircumcised in heart and
ears.” This also is from the prophets: nothing is of himself. “Ye do
always resist the Holy Ghost: as your fathers did, so do ye.” ([Acts
7.51](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#051)<span id="vi.xvii-p16.2"></span>..md)
When it was not His will that sacrifices should be, ye sacrifice: when
it is His will, then again ye do not sacrifice: when He would not give
you commandments, ye drew them to you: when ye got them, ye neglected
them. Again, when the Temple stood, ye worshipped idols: when it is His
will to be worshipped without a Temple, ye do the opposite. Observe, he
says not, “Ye resist God,” but, “the Spirit:” so far was he from knowing
any difference between Them. And, what is greater: “As your fathers
did,” he says, “so do ye.” Thus also did Christ (reproach them),
forasmuch as they were always boasting much of their fathers. “Which of
the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they have slain them
which showed before of the coming of the Just One:” he still says, “the
Just One,” wishing to check them: “of Whom ye have been now the
betrayers and murderers”—two charges he lays against them <span
id="fr_395"></span>[396](#fn_395.md) —“who have received the Law by the
disposition of Angels, and have not kept it.” ([Acts
7.52](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#052)<span id="vi.xvii-p17.1"></span>..md)
How, “By the disposition of Angels?” Some say (The Law), disposed by
Angels; or, put into his hand by the Angel Who appeared to him in the
bush; for was He man? No wonder that He <span
id="fr_396"></span>[397](#fn_396.md) who wrought those works, should also
have wrought these. <span id="fr_397"></span>[398](#fn_397.md) “Ye slew
them who preached of Him,” much more Himself. He shows them disobedient
both to God, and to Angels, and the Prophets, and the Spirit, and to
all: as also Scripture saith elsewhere: “Lord, they have slain Thy
Prophets, and thrown down Thine altars.” (<span
id="vi.xvii-p19.7"></span>[1 Kings xix.
10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#010)<span id="vi.xvii-p19.8"></span>..md)
They, then, stand up for the Law, and say, “He blasphemeth against
Moses:” he shows, therefore, that it is they who blaspheme, and that
(their blasphemy is not only against Moses, but) against God; shows that
“they” from the very beginning have been doing this: that “they” have
themselves destroyed their “customs,” that there is no need of these:
that while accusing him, and saying that he opposed Moses, they
themselves were opposing the Spirit: and not merely opposing, but with
murder added to it: and that they had their enmity all along from the
very beginning. Seest thou, that he shows them to be acting in
opposition both to Moses and to all others, and not keeping the Law? And
yet Moses had said, “A Prophet shall the Lord raise up unto you: and the
rest also told of this (Christ) that He would come: and the prophet
again said, “What house will ye build Me?” and again, “Did ye offer to
Me slain beasts and sacrifices” those “forty years?” (<span
id="vi.xvii-p19.9"></span>[Deut. xviii.
18](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#018)<span id="vi.xvii-p19.10"></span>..md)

<span id="vi.xvii-p20"></span>Such is the boldness of speech of a man
bearing the Cross. Let us then also imitate this: though it be not a
time of war, yet it is always the time for boldness of speech. For, “I
spake,” says one, “in Thy testimonies before kings, and was not
ashamed.” ([Ps. cxix. 46](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#046.md)<span
id="vi.xvii-p20.1"></span>.) If we chance to be among heathens, let us
thus stop their mouths. without wrath, without harshness. (Comp. Hom. in
[1 Cor. iv.](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#000.md)<span
id="vi.xvii-p20.2"></span> §6; xxxiii. §4, 5; Col. xi.<span
id="vi.xvii-p20.3"></span> §2.) For if we do it with wrath, it no longer
seems to be the boldness (of one who is confident of his cause,) but
passion: but if with gentleness, this is boldness indeed. For <span
id="fr_398"></span>[399](#fn_398.md) in one and the same thing success and
failure cannot possibly go together. The boldness is a success: the
anger is a failure. Therefore, if we are to have boldness, we must be
clean from wrath that none may impute our words to that. No matter how
just your words may be, when you speak with anger, you ruin all: no
matter how boldly you speak, how fairly reprove, or what not. See this
man, how free from passion as he discourses to them! For he did not
abuse them: he did but remind them of the words of the Prophets. For, to
show you that it was not anger, at the very moment he was suffering evil
at their hands, he prayed, saying, “Lay not to their charge this sin.”
So far was he from speaking these words in anger; no, he spake in grief
and sorrow for their sakes. As indeed this is why it speaks of his
appearance, that “they saw his face as it had been the face of an
angel,” on purpose that they might believe. Let us then be clean from
wrath. The Holy Spirit dwelleth not where wrath is: cursed is the
wrathful. It cannot be that aught wholesome should approach, where wrath
goes forth. For as in a storm at sea, great is the tumult, loud the
clamor, and then would be no time for lessons of wisdom (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xvii-p21.5"></span>φιλοσοφεἵν</span>): so
neither in wrath. If the soul is to be in a condition either to say, or
to be disciplined to, aught of philosophy, it must first be in the
haven. Seest thou not how, when we wish to converse on matters of
serious import, we look out for places free from noise, where all is
stillness, all calm, that we may not be put out and discomposed? But if
noise from without discomposes, much more disturbance from within.
Whether one pray, to no purpose does he pray “with wrath and
disputings:” ([1 Tim. ii. 8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#008.md)<span
id="vi.xvii-p21.6"></span>) whether he speak, he will only make himself
ridiculous: whether he hold his peace, so again it will be even then:
whether he eat, he is hurt even then: whether he drink, or whether he
drink not; whether he sit, or stand, or walk; whether he sleep: for even
in their dreams such fancies haunt them. For what is there in such men
that is not disagreeable? Eyes unsightly, mouth distorted, limbs
agitated and swollen, tongue foul and sparing no man, mind distraught,
gestures uncomely: much to disgust. Mark the eyes of demoniacs, and
those of drunkards and madmen; in what do they differ from each other?
Is not the whole madness? For what though it be but for the moment? The
madman too is possessed for the moment: but what is worse than this? And
they are not ashamed at that excuse; “I knew not (saith one) what I
said.” And how came it that thou didst not know this, thou the rational
man, thou that hast the gift of reason, on purpose that thou mayest not
act the part of the creatures without reason, just like a wild horse,
hurried away by rage and passion? In truth, the very excuse is criminal.
For thou oughtest to have known what thou saidst. “It was the passion,”
say you, “that spoke the words, not I.” How should it be that? For
passion has no power, except it get it from you. You might as well say,
“It was my hand that inflicted the wounds, not I.” What occasion, think
you, most needs wrath? would you not say, war and battle? But even then,
if anything is done with wrath, the whole is spoiled and undone. For of
all men, those who fight had best not be enraged: of all men, those had
best not be enraged, who want to hurt (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xvii-p21.7"></span>τοὺς ὑβρίζοντας</span>). And how is it
possible to fight then? you will ask. With reason, with self-command
(<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xvii-p21.8"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xvii-p21.9"></span>πιεικεί& 139·</span>):
since fighting is, to stand in opposition. Seest thou not that even
these (common) wars are regulated by definite law, and order, and times?
For wrath is nothing but an irrational impulse: and an irrational
creature cannot possibly perform aught rational. For instance, the man
here spoke such words, and did it without passion. And Elias said,” How
long will ye halt on both your knees?” (<span
id="vi.xvii-p21.10"></span>[1 Kings xviii.
21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#021)<span id="vi.xvii-p21.11"></span>.md)
and spake it not in passion. And Phinees slew, and did it without
passion. For passion suffers not a man to see, but, just as in a
night-battle, it leads him, with eyes blindfolded and ears stopped up,
where it will. Then let us rid ourselves of this demon, at its first
beginning let us quell it, let us put the sign of the Cross on our
breast, as it were a curb. Wrath is a shameless dog: but let it learn to
hear the law. If there be in a sheep-fold a dog so savage as not to obey
the command of the shepherd, nor to know his voice, all is lost and
ruined. He is kept along with the sheep: but if he makes a meal on the
sheep, he is useless, and is put to death. If he has learnt to obey
thee, feed thy dog: he is useful when it is against the wolves, against
robbers, and against the captain of the robbers that he barks, not
against the sheep, not against friends. If he does not obey he ruins
all: if he learns not to mind thee, he destroys all. The mildness in
thee let not wrath consume, but let it guard it, and feed it up. And it
will guard it, that it may feed in much security, if it destroy wicked
and evil thoughts, if it chase away the devil from every side. So is
gentleness preserved, when evil works are nowhere admitted: so we become
worthy of respect, when we learn not to be shameless. For nothing
renders a man so shameless, as an evil conscience. Why are harlots
without shame? Why are virgins shamefaced? Is it not from their sin that
the former, from their chastity that the latter, are such? For nothing
makes a person so shameless, as sin. “And yet on the contrary,” say you,
“it puts to shame.” Yes; him who condemns himself: but him that is past
blushing, it renders even more reckless: for desperation makes daring.
For “the wicked,” saith the Scripture, “when he is come into the depths
of evils, despiseth.” (<span id="vi.xvii-p21.12"></span>[Prov. xviii.
3](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#003)<span id="vi.xvii-p21.13"></span>..md)
But he that is shameless, will also be reckless, and he that is
reckless, will be daring.

<span id="vi.xvii-p22"></span>See in what way gentleness is destroyed,
when evil thoughts gnaw at it. This is why there is such a dog, barking
mightily: we have also sling and stone (ye know what I mean): we have
also spear and enclosure and cattle-fold: let us guard our thoughts
unhurt. If the dog be gentle (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xvii-p22.1"></span>σαίνῃ</span>) with the sheep, but savage
against those without, and keep vigilant watch, this is the excellence
of a dog: and, be he ever so famished, not to devour the sheep; be he
ever so full, not to spare the wolves. Such too is anger meant to be:
however provoked, not to forsake gentleness; however at quiet, to be on
the alert against evil thoughts: to acknowledge the friend, and not for
any beating forsake him, and for all his caressing, to fly at the
intruder. The devil uses caressing full oft: let <span
id="fr_399"></span>[400](#fn_399.md) the dog know at sight that he is an
intruder. So also let us caress (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xvii-p23.17"></span>σαίνωμεν</span>) Virtue, though she put us to
pain, and show our aversion to Vice, though she give us pleasure. Let us
not be worse than the dogs, which, even when whipped and throttled, do
not desert their master: but if <span id="fr_400"></span>[401](#fn_400.md)
the stranger also feed them, even so they do hurt. There are times when
anger is useful; but this is when it barks against strangers. What means
it, “Whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause?” ([Matt. v.
22](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#022)<span id="vi.xvii-p24.11"></span>..md)
It means, Stand not up in thine own quarrel, neither avenge thyself: if
thou see another suffering deadly wrong, stretch out thy hand to help
him. This is no longer passion, when thou art clear of all feeling for
thyself alone. David had gotten Saul into his power, and was not moved
by passion, did not thrust the spear into him, the enemy he had in his
power; but took his revenge upon the Devil. (<span
id="vi.xvii-p24.12"></span>[1 Sam. xxvi.
7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#007)<span id="vi.xvii-p24.13"></span>..md)
Moses, when he saw a stranger doing an injury, even slew him (<span
id="vi.xvii-p24.14"></span>[Exod. ii.
22](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#022)<span id="vi.xvii-p24.15"></span>.md):
but when one of his own people, he did not so: them that were brethren
he would have reconciled; the others not so. That “most meek” (<span
id="vi.xvii-p24.16"></span>[Num. xii.
3](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#003)<span id="vi.xvii-p24.17"></span>.md)
Moses, as Scripture witnesseth of him, see how he was roused! But not
so, we: on the contrary, where we ought to show meekness, no wild beast
so fierce as we: but where we ought to be roused, none so dull and
sluggish. (Hom. vi. *de laud. Pauli, ad fin.*) On no occasion do we use
our faculties to the purpose they were meant for: and therefore it is
that our life is spent to no purpose. For even in the case of
implements; if one use them, one instead of other, all is spoilt: if one
take his sword, and then, where he should use it and cut with it, uses
only his hand, he does no good: again, where he should use his hand, by
taking the sword in hand he spoils all. In like manner also the
physician, if where he ought to cut, he cuts not, and where he ought
not, he does cut, mars all. Wherefore, I beseech you, let us use the
thing (<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xvii-p24.18"></span>τᾥ
πράγματι</span>) at its proper time. The proper time for anger is never,
where we move in our own quarrel: but if it is our duty to correct
others, then is the time to use it, that we may by force deliver others.
(*Hom. in Matt*. xvi. §7.) So shall we both be like unto God, always
keeping a spirit free from wrath, and shall attain unto the good things
that are to come, through the grace and loving-kindness of our Lord
Jesus Christ, with whom, to the Father and the Holy Ghost together, be
glory, dominion, and honor, now and evermore, world without end. Amen.

<span id="vi.xvii-p7"></span> The meaning of [Acts
7.38](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#038.md)<span id="vi.xvii-p7.1"></span> is
that Moses became (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xvii-p7.2"></span>γενόμενος</span>) a mediator between God
(represented by the Angel) and the people. Cf. <span
id="vi.xvii-p7.3"></span>[Gal. iii.
19](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#019.md)<span id="vi.xvii-p7.4"></span>
where the law is said to have been “ordained through angels, by the hand
of a mediator” (Moses). No mention is made of angels as revealers of the
law in [Exodus xix](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#000.md)<span
id="vi.xvii-p7.5"></span>. the first mention of angels in connection
with the giving of the law being in a highly poetic passage in Moses’
benediction, <span id="vi.xvii-p7.6"></span>[Deut. xxxiii.
2](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#002.md)<span id="vi.xvii-p7.7"></span>.
(Even here the Heb. text is uncertain. Cf. the lxx. *in loco*). The
function of angels in the giving of the law has a prominent place in
later Jewish theology as opposed to the action of mere human ministers.
The New Testament notices on the subject reflect this later phase of
thought (Cf. <span id="vi.xvii-p7.8"></span>[Acts vii.
53](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#053.md)<span id="vi.xvii-p7.9"></span>;
[Heb. ii. 2](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#002.md)<span
id="vi.xvii-p7.10"></span>). See Lightfoot on [Gal. ii.

<span id="vi.xvii-p8"></span> By <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xvii-p8.1"></span>λόγια ζῶντα</span> are meant living oracles in
the sense of operative, effectual, as Jesus affirmed his words to be
“spirit and life” ([John vi. 63](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#063.md)<span
id="vi.xvii-p8.2"></span>). They contain vital truth. The law was indeed
“weak” ([Rom. viii. 3](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#003.md)<span
id="vi.xvii-p8.3"></span>) but it was so “through the flesh,” i.e. human
sinfulness. It was not inherently weak but was so relatively to the
great power of sin in man which needed to be overcome.—G.B.S.

<span id="fn_388"></span>[i:389](1110022.htm#fr_388.md) <span
id="vi.xvii-p8.8"></span>

<span id="vi.xvii-p9"></span> It is not probable that this passage
(<span id="vi.xvii-p9.1"></span>v. 39, 40) means that the people
proposed to return to Egypt (as Chrys.). In the O.T. the constant
representation is that the golden calf (or bull) was worshipped as the
image of the divinity who had *led them out of Egypt* (<span
id="vi.xvii-p9.2"></span>[Ex. xxxii.
4](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#004.md)<span id="vi.xvii-p9.3"></span>; [1
Kings xii. 28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#028.md)<span
id="vi.xvii-p9.4"></span>). It seems clearly implied in <span
id="vi.xvii-p9.5"></span>[Ezek. 20:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#007.md),
[8](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#008.md),
[24](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#024.md)<span id="vi.xvii-p9.6"></span>,
that the Israelites while in Egypt had been much addicted to the
idolatry of the country. The meaning here is that, being discouraged and
disappointed on account of Moses’ continued absence in the mount, they
were ready to transfer their allegiance from Jehovah to some of the
divinities to whose worship they had previously been accustomed. The
worship of cattle was especially common, as of Apis at Memphis and
Mnevis at Heliopolis.—G.B.S.

<span id="vi.xvii-p11"></span> This clause, omitted by A. B. C , is
preserved by N. and the Catena. The calf was one, yet they called it
Gods: on which St. Chrys. remarks elsewhere, that they added polytheism
to idolatry.—The next sentence may perhaps be completed thus: “that they
did not even know that there is One God.”—Edd. from E.F.D. “So frantic
are they, that they know not what they say.”

<span id="vi.xvii-p12"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xvii-p12.1"></span>διὰ γὰρ τοῦτο ἐπισημαίνεται</span>. The
meaning is: Stephen was accused of speaking against “the
customs,”—sacrifices, temple, feasts, etc. Therefore he significantly
points to that critical conjuncture from which these “customs” date
their introduction: namely, the Provocation at Horeb. Prior to that, he
tells of “living oracles,” life-giving precepts: after it, and as its
consequence, sacrifices, etc., those statutes which were not good, and
ordinances by which a man shall not live, as God says by Ezekiel. Not a
word of sacrifice till then: and the first mention is, of the sacrifices
offered to the calf. In like manner, “they rejoiced,” “the people ate
and drank, and rose up to play:” and in consequence of this, the feasts
were prescribed: <span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xvii-p12.2"></span>καὶ
εὐφραίνοντο, φησίν· διὰ τοῦτο καὶ ἑορταί</span>.—<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xvii-p12.3"></span>᾽</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xvii-p12.4"></span>Ε</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xvii-p12.5"></span>πισημαίνεται</span> might
be rendered, “he marks,” “puts a mark upon it” (so the innovator, who
substitutes, <span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xvii-p12.6"></span>τοῦτο
καὶ Δαυὶδ ἐπισημαινόμενος λέγει</span>): we take it passively, “there is
a mark set over it—it is emphatically denoted.” In the active, the verb
taken intransitively means “to betoken or announce itself,” “make its
first appearance.”—In the Treatise *adv. Judæos,* iv. §6. tom. i. 624.
C. St. Chrysostom gives this account of the legal sacrifices: “To what
purpose unto Me is the multitude of your sacrifices? etc. (<span
id="vi.xvii-p12.7"></span>[Isaiah
i.](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#000.md)<span id="vi.xvii-p12.8"></span>,
11, ff.) Do ye hear how it is most plainly declared, that God did not
from the first require these at your hands? Had He required them, He
would have obliged those famous saints who were before the Law to
observe this practice. ‘Then wherefore has He permitted it now?’ In
condescension to your infirmity. As a physician in his treatment of a
delirious patient, etc.: thus did God likewise. For seeing them so
frantic in their lust for sacrifices, that they were ready, unless they
got them, to desert to idols: nay not only ready, but that they had
already deserted, thereupon He permitted sacrifices. And that this is
the reason, is clear from the order of events. After the feast which
they made to the demons, then it was that He permitted sacrifices: all
but saying: ‘Ye are mad, and will needs sacrifice: well then, at any
rate sacrifice to Me.’”—(What follows may serve to illustrate the brief
remark a little further on, <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.xvii-p12.9"></span>Καὶ ἡ αἰχμαλωσία κατηγορία τῆς κακίας</span>.)
“But even this, He did not permit to continue to the end, but by a most
wise method, withdrew them from it…For He did not permit it to be done
in any place of the whole world, but in Jerusalem only. Anon, when for a
short time they had sacrificed, he destroyed the city. Had He openly
said, Desist, they, such was their insane passion for sacrificing, would
not readily have complied. But now perforce, the place being taken away,
He secretly withdrew them from their frenzy.” So here: “Even the
captivity impeaches the wickedness (which was the cause of the
permission of sacrifice.”)

<span id="fn_392"></span>[i:393](1110022.htm#fr_392.md) <span
id="vi.xvii-p12.12"></span>

<span id="vi.xvii-p13"></span> Our passage here follows the lxx. which
speaks of Moloch and Remphan. The terms in the original (vid. R.V.:
[Amos v. 25-27](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#025.md)<span
id="vi.xvii-p13.1"></span>) are “Siccuth” and “Chiun.” It is a disputed
point whether these are in the prophecy names of divinities or whether
they mean respectively “tabernacle” and “shrine” (or image). The
difficulty lies in the ambiguity of the Hebrew text. The name Moloch
being akin to the Hebrew word for king (<span class="Hebrew"><span
id="vi.xvii-p13.2"></span>מלך</span>), confusion might easily arise. The
N.T. text varies from the lxx. only in adding the word <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.xvii-p13.3"></span>προσκυνεῖν</span> ([Acts
7.43](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#043)<span id="vi.xvii-p13.4"></span>.md)
to lay emphasis upon the charge of idolatry, and in replacing Damascus
by Babylon ([Acts 7.43](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#043.md)<span
id="vi.xvii-p13.5"></span>), an interpretation from the standpoint of
subsequent history. The statement of our text that the Israelites fell
into the worship of these divinities *in the wilderness* rests upon
extra-Pentateuchal tradition, derived, perhaps, from such prohibitions
of Moloch-worship and similar idolatries as are found in [Lev.
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#021.md), [Deut.
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#010.md)<span
id="vi.xvii-p13.6"></span>[Lev. xviii.
21](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#021.md)<span id="vi.xvii-p13.7"></span>,
and [Deut. xviii. 10](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#010.md)<span
id="vi.xvii-p13.8"></span>. The charge in the prophecy of Amos is a
general one referring to the frequent lapses of the people into
image-worship down to his own time.—G.B.S.

of the etymology of <span class="Hebrew"><span

<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xvii-p24.9"></span>πῶς οὐ μᾶλλον
βλάψουσιν</span>; in the sense, “If however the stranger (not merely
caresses but) also (regularly) feeds them, how shall they not do more
hurt (than good)?” i.e. “If the devil be suffered to pamper our anger,
that which should have been our safeguard will prove a bane to
us.”—Perhaps this is the sense intended in the old reading; but if so,
<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.xvii-p24.10"></span>καὶ οὕτω</span> is
unsuitable.
