<span id="xv.iii.v-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xv.iii.v-p1.1"></span>Excursus on the Other Acts of the
Council.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.v-p2"></span>As only the Canons have any real connexion
with the Ecumenical Synods, they alone have properly a place in this
volume, and yet it may not be amiss to give a brief account of the other
acts of the council, so far as we know them.

<span id="xv.iii.v-p3"></span>(a)  *The Rule for Keeping Easter*.—The
Anglican Scholar, the Rev. William Cureton, of the British Museum, first
edited the then recently discovered Preface to the *Paschal Letters*
<span id="page_434">p. 434</span> <span id="xv.iii.v-Page_434"></span>of
St. Athanasius, together with the Letters themselves.  The <span
class="sc"><span id="xv.iii.v-p3.1"></span>ms.</span> which he then
published was in Syriac and was discovered in Egypt.  In the preface
just referred to, it is expressly stated that “a plan was agreed upon at
Sardica with regard to the feast of Easter.”  But this new plan, which
was only expected to hold good for fifty years, failed, and although in
<span class="sc"><span id="xv.iii.v-p3.2"></span>a.d.</span> 346 Easter
should have fallen on March 23d, yet the Council (so says St.
Athanasius) agreed to observe it on March 30th.  Another divergence fell
in <span class="sc"><span id="xv.iii.v-p3.3"></span>a.d.</span> 349. 
Easter, by the Alexandrian calculation, would have been April 23d.  But
by Roman count, the origin of which was attributed to St. Peter, Easter
was never to be later than April 21st, and for the sake of peace the
Alexandrians yielded to the Romans and kept Easter on March 26th; but in
350, 360, and 368 the Alexandrian and Roman methods again disagreed, and
even the fifty years which Sardica had thought to ensure uniformity were
marked by diverse usages.

<span id="xv.iii.v-p4"></span>(b)  *The Encyclical Letter*.—The Council
addressed a long Encyclical letter to all the bishops of the world; it
is found in St. Athanasius <span id="fr_402"></span>[403](#fn_402.md) in
Greek, in St. Hilary of Poictiers <span
id="fr_403"></span>[404](#fn_403.md) in Latin, and in Theodoret’s
*Ecclesiastical History*. <span id="fr_404"></span>[405](#fn_404.md)   In
this last there occurs at the end the so-called “Creed of Sardica,”
which is now considered by scholars to be undoubtedly spurious.

<span id="xv.iii.v-p8"></span>(c)  *A Letter to the Diocese of
Alexandria*.—St. Athanasius <span id="fr_405"></span>[406](#fn_405.md)
gives us the Greek text of a letter sent by the council to the diocese
of Alexandria to the bishops of Egypt and Libya.

<span id="xv.iii.v-p10"></span>(d)  *A Letter to Pope Julius*.—Among the
*Fragments* of St. Hilary <span id="fr_406"></span>[407](#fn_406.md) is
found a letter from the synod to Pope Julius.  Hefele says that the text
is “considerably injured.”  One clause of this letter above all others
has given occasion to much controversy.  The passage runs as follows: 
“It was best and fittest that the priests \[i.e., bishops\] from all the
provinces should make their reports to the head, that is, the chair of
St. Peter.”  Blondell declares the passage to be an interpolation,
resting his opinion upon the barbarous Latin of the expression *valde
congruentissimum*.  And even Remi Ceillier, while explaining this by the
supposition, which is wholly gratuitous, that the original was Greek,
yet is forced to confess that the sentence interrupts the flow of
thought and looks like an insertion.  Bower, <span
id="fr_407"></span>[408](#fn_407.md) in his *History of the Popes*, and
Fuchs <span id="fr_408"></span>[409](#fn_408.md) have urged still more
strongly the spurious character of the phrase, the latter using the
convenient “marginal comment” explanation.

<span id="xv.iii.v-p14"></span>Besides these there are three documents
which Scipio Maffei discovered in <span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iii.v-p14.1"></span>ms.</span> at Verona, which by some are
supposed to belong to the Council of Sardica.

<span id="xv.iii.v-p15"></span>(a)  A Letter to the Christians of
Mareotis.

<span id="xv.iii.v-p16"></span>(b)  A Letter of St. Athanasius to the
same Mareotic Churches.  This letter is signed not only by Athanasius,
but also by a great number of the bishops composing the synod.

<span id="xv.iii.v-p17"></span>(c)  A Letter from St. Athanasius to the
Church of Alexandria.

<span id="xv.iii.v-p18"></span>On the authority to be attributed to
these three documents I can do no better than quote the closing words of
Hefele, <span id="fr_409"></span>[410](#fn_409.md) whom I have followed in
this whole excursus.

<span id="xv.iii.v-p20"></span>“These extracts shew, I think, quite
sufficiently the spuriousness of these documents.  Is it possible that
the Eusebians would have said of themselves:  ‘We are enemies of
Christ?’  But apart from this, the whole contents of these three letters
are lame and feeble.  The constant repetition of the same words is
intolerable, and the whole style pointless and trivial.  To this it must
be added that the whole of Christian antiquity knew nothing of these
three documents, which only exist in the codex at Verona, so that we
cannot acknowledge them as genuine.”
