<span id="viii.iv.iii.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="viii.iv.iii.xii-p1.1"></span>Canon XII.</span>

<span id="viii.iv.iii.xii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iv.iii.xii-p2.1"></span>If</span> any one be baptized when he
is ill, forasmuch as his \[profession of\] faith was not voluntary, but
of necessity \[i.e. though fear of death\] he cannot be promoted to the
presbyterate, unless on account of his subsequent \[display of\] zeal
and faith, and because of a lack of men.

<span id="viii.iv.iii.xii-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iv.iii.xii-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XII.</span>

<span id="viii.iv.iii.xii-p5"></span>One baptized on account of sickness
is not to be made presbyter, unless in reward for a contest which he
afterwards sustains and on account of scarcity of men.

<span id="viii.iv.iii.xii-p6"></span>The word used in the Greek for
“baptized” is “illuminated” (<span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.iv.iii.xii-p6.1"></span>φωτισθῇ</span>), a very common
expression among the ancients.

<span id="viii.iv.iii.xii-p7"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iv.iii.xii-p7.1"></span>Aristenus.</span>

<span id="viii.iv.iii.xii-p8"></span>He that is baptised by reason of
illness, and, therefore come to his illumination not freely but of
necessity, shall not be admitted to the priesthood unless both these
conditions concur, that there are few suitable men to be found and that
he has endured a hard conflict after his baptism.

<span id="viii.iv.iii.xii-p9"></span><span id="page_85">p. 85</span>
<span id="viii.iv.iii.xii-Page_85"></span>With this interpretation agree
also Zonaras and Balsamon, the latter expressly saying, “If one of these
conditions is lacking, the canon must be observed.”  Not only has
Isidore therefore missed the meaning by changing the copulative into the
disjunctive conjunction (as Van Espen points out) but Beveridge has
fallen into the same error, not indeed in the canon itself, but in
translating the Ancient Epitome.

<span id="viii.iv.iii.xii-p10"></span>Zonaras explains that the reason
for this prohibition was the well-known fact that in those ages baptism
was put off so as the longer to be free from the restraints which
baptism was considered to impose.  From this interpretation only
Aubespine dissents, and Hefele points out how entirely without reason.

<span id="viii.iv.iii.xii-p11"></span>This canon is found in the *Corpus
Juris Canonici*, Gratian’s *Decretum*., Pars. I., Dist. lvii., c. i.
