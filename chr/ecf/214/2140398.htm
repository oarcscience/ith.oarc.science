<p class="c18"><a name="xiv.iii.xv-p2"></A><span class="sc"><a name="xiv.iii.xv-p2.1"></A>Let</span> the canon of our holy God-bearing Fathers be confirmed in this particular also; that a presbyter be not ordained before he is thirty years of age, even if he be a very worthy man, but let him be kept back.&#160; For our Lord Jesus Christ was baptized and began to teach when he was thirty.&#160; In like manner let no deacon be ordained before he is twenty-five, nor a deaconess before she is forty.</p>

<p class="c35"><a name="xiv.iii.xv-p5"></A>A presbyter thirty years of age, a deacon twenty-five, and a deaconess forty.</p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="xiv.iii.xv-p6"></A>Compare Canon XI. of Neoc&aelig;sarea.</p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="xiv.iii.xv-p7"></A>It may be interesting to note here that by the law of the Roman Communion the canonical ages are as follows:</p> 
<p class="c19"><a name="xiv.iii.xv-p8"></A>A subdeacon must have completed his twenty-first year, a deacon his twenty-second, a priest his twenty-fourth, and a bishop his thirtieth.&#160; None of the inferior clergy can hold a simple benefice before he has begun his fourteenth year.&#160; Ecclesiastical dignities, such as Cathedral canonries, cannot be conferred on any who have not finished the twenty-second year.&#160; A benefice to which is attached a cure of souls can be given only to one who is over twenty-four, and a diocese only to one who has completed his thirtieth year.&#160; (<i>Vide</i> Ferraris, <i>Bibliotheca Prompta</i>.)</p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="xiv.iii.xv-p9"></A>In the Anglican Communion the ages are, in England, for a bishop &#8220;fully thirty years of age,&#8221; for a priest twenty-four, and for a deacon twenty-three:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_360"></A><A HREF="#fn_360"><FONT SIZE="1">361</FONT></A>
&#160; and in the United States, for a bishop thirty years of age, for a priest twenty-four, and for a deacon twenty-one.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="xiv.iii.xv-p10"></A> A faculty is allowed for earlier ordination, but since 1804 only to be granted by the Archbishop of Canterbury.&#160; This limitation is, however, only of Parliamentary sanction (44 Geo. III., ch. 43).</p>
