id="vii.vi.xxix-p1.1"></span>Excursus on the Deaconess of the Early
Church.</span>

<span id="vii.vi.xxix-p2"></span>It has been supposed by many that the
deaconess of the Early Church had an Apostolic institution and that its
existence may be referred to by St. Paul in his Epistle to the Romans
([Rom. 16.1](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#001.md)<span
id="vii.vi.xxix-p2.1"></span>) where he speaks of Phœbe as being a <span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.vi.xxix-p2.2"></span>διάκονος</span> of the
Church of Cenchrea.  It moreover has been suggested that the “widows” of
[1 Tim. v. 9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#009.md)<span
id="vii.vi.xxix-p2.3"></span> may have been deaconesses, and this seems
not unlikely from the fact that the age for the admission of women to
this ministry was fixed by Tertullian at sixty years (*De Vel. Virg*.
Cap. ix.), and only changed to forty, two centuries later by the Council
of Chalcedon, and from the further fact that these “widows” spoken of by
St. Paul seem to have had a vow of chastity, for it is expressly said
that if they marry they have “damnation, because they have cast off
their first faith” ([1 Tim. v. 12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#012.md)<span
id="vii.vi.xxix-p2.4"></span>).

<span id="vii.vi.xxix-p3"></span>These women were called <span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.vi.xxix-p3.1"></span>διακόνισσαι,
πρεσβυτίδες</span> (which must be distinguished from the <span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.vi.xxix-p3.2"></span>πρεσβυτέραι</span> , a
poor class referred to in the *Apostolic Constitutions* (ii. 28) who are
to be only invited frequently to the love-feasts, while the <span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.vi.xxix-p3.3"></span>πρεσβυτίδες</span> had
a definite allotment of the offerings assigned to their support), <span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.vi.xxix-p3.4"></span>χῆραι</span>,
*diaconissæ*, *presbyteræ*, and *viduæ*.

<span id="vii.vi.xxix-p4"></span>The one great characteristic of the
deaconess was that she was vowed to perpetual chastity. <span
id="fr_102"></span>[103](#fn_102.md)   The *Apostolical Constitutions* (vi.
17) say that she must be a chaste virgin (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.vi.xxix-p5.1"></span>παρθένος ἁγνὴ</span>) or else a widow.  The
writer of the article “Deaconess” in the *Dictionary of Christian
Antiquities* says:  “It is evident that the ordination of deaconesses
included a vow of celibacy.”  We have already seen the language used by
St. Paul and of this the wording of the canon of Chalcedon is but an
echo (Canon xv).  “A woman shall not receive the laying on of hands as a
deaconess under forty years of age, and then only after searching
examination.  And if, after she has had hands laid on her, and has
continued for a time to minister, she shall despise the Grace of God and
give herself in marriage, she shall be anathematized and the man who is
united to her.”  The civil law went still further, and by Justinian’s
Sixth Novel (6) those who attempted to marry are subjected to forfeiture
of property and capital punishment.  In the collect in the ancient
office there is a special petition that the newly admitted deaconess may
have the gift of continence.

<span id="vii.vi.xxix-p6"></span>The principal work of the deaconess was
to assist the female candidates for holy baptism.  At that time the
sacrament of baptism was always administered by immersion (except to
those in extreme illness) and hence there was much that such an order of
women could be useful in.  Moreover they sometimes gave to the female
catechumens preliminary instruction, but their work was wholly limited
to women, and for a deaconess of the Early Church to teach a man or to
nurse him in sickness would have been an impossibility.  The duties of
the deaconess are set forth in many ancient writings, I cite here what
is commonly known as the XII Canon of the Fourth Council of Carthage,
which met in the year 398:

<span id="vii.vi.xxix-p7"></span>“Widows and dedicated women
(*sanctimoniales*) who are chosen to assist at the baptism of women,
should be so well instructed in their office as to be able to teach
aptly and properly unskilled and rustic women how to answer at the time
of their baptism to the questions put to them, and also how to live
godly after they have been baptized.”  This whole matter is treated
clearly by St. Epiphanius who, while indeed speaking of deaconesses as
an order (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.vi.xxix-p7.1"></span>τάγμα</span>), asserts that “they were only
women-elders, not priestesses in any sense, that their <span
id="page_42">p. 42</span> <span id="vii.vi.xxix-Page_42"></span>mission
was not to interfere in any way with Sacerdotal functions, but simply to
perform certain offices in the care of women” (*Hær*. lxxix., cap.
iij).  From all this it is evident that they are entirely in error who
suppose that “the laying on of hands” which the deaconesses received
corresponded to that by which persons were ordained to the diaconate,
presbyterate, and episcopate at that period of the church’s history.  It
was merely a solemn dedication and blessing and was not looked upon as
“an outward sign of an inward grace given.”  For further proof of this I
must refer to Morinus, who has treated the matter most admirably.  (*De
Ordinationibus*, Exercitatio X.)

<span id="vii.vi.xxix-p8"></span>The deaconesses existed but a short
while.  The council of Laodicea as early as <span class="sc"><span
id="vii.vi.xxix-p8.1"></span>a.d.</span> 343–381, forbade the
appointment of any who were called <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.vi.xxix-p8.2"></span>πρεσβύτιδες</span> (*Vide* Canon xi); and
the first council of Orange, <span class="sc"><span
id="vii.vi.xxix-p8.3"></span>a.d.</span> 441, in its twenty-sixth canon
forbids the appointment of deaconesses altogether, and the Second
council of the same city in canons xvij and xviij, decrees that
deaconesses who married were to be excommunicated unless they renounced
the men they were living with, and that, on account of the weakness of
the sex, none for the future were to be ordained.

<span id="vii.vi.xxix-p9"></span>Thomassinus, to whom I refer the reader
for a very full treatment of the whole subject, is of opinion that the
order was extinct in the West by the tenth or twelfth century, but that
it lingered on a little later at Constantinople but only in conventual
institutions.  (Thomassin, *Ancienne et Nouvelle Discipline de l’
Eglise*, I Partie, Livre III.)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_102"></span>[41:103](2140047.htm#fr_102.md) <span
id="vii.vi.xxix-p4.1"></span>

<span id="vii.vi.xxix-p5"></span> In 1836, the Lutheran Pastor Fliedner,
of a little town on the Rhine, opened a parish hospital the nurses of
which he called “Deaconesses.”  This “Deaconess House” at Kaiserswerth,
was the mother-house from which all the deaconess establishments of the
present day have taken their origin.  The Methodists have adopted the
system successfully.  Some efforts have been made to domesticate it, in
a somewhat modified form, also in the Anglican Churches but thus far
with but little success.  Of course these “Deaconesses” resemble the
Deaconesses of the Early Church only in name.  The reader who may be
interested in seeing an effort to connect the modern deaconess with the
deaconess of antiquity is referred to *The Ministry of Deaconesses* by
Deaconess Cecilia Robinson.  This book, it should be said, contains much
valuable and accurate information upon the subject, but accepts as
proven facts the suppositions of the late Bishop Lightfoot upon the
subject; who somewhat rashly asserted that “the female diaconate is as
definite an institution as the male diaconate.  Phœbe is as much a
deacon as Stephen or Philip is a deacon!”
