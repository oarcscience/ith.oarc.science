id="xiv.iii.lxxxix-p1.1"></span>Canon LXXXVIII.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.lxxxix-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.lxxxix-p2.1"></span>No</span> one may drive any beast into a
church except perchance a traveller, urged thereto by the greatest
necessity, in default of a shed or resting-place, may have turned aside
into said church.  For unless the beast had been taken inside, it would
have perished, and he, by the loss of his beast of burden, and thus
without means of continuing his journey, would be in peril of death. 
And we are taught that the Sabbath was made for man:  wherefore also the
safety and comfort of man are by all means to be placed first.  But
should anyone be detected without any necessity such as we have just
mentioned, leading his beast into a church, if he be a cleric let him be
deposed, and if a layman let him be cut off.

holy halls, unless the greatest necessity compels it.*
