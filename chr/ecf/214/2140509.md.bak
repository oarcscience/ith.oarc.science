id="xv.iii.iv.xv-p3.1"></span>Bishop</span> <span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iii.iv.xv-p3.2"></span>Januarius</span> said:  Let your holiness
also decree this, that no bishop be allowed to try to gain for himself a
minister in the church of a bishop of another city and ordain him to one
of his own parishes.

<span id="xv.iii.iv.xv-p4"></span>All said:  Such is our pleasure,
inasmuch as discord is apt to spring from contentions in this matter,
and therefore the sentence of us all forbids anyone to presume to do

<span id="xv.iii.iv.xv-p5"></span><span class="c4"><span

<span id="xv.iii.iv.xv-p7"></span>It is manifest that these two canons
\[xviii. of the Latin and xv. of the Greek\], contain the resolution of
the same case, and therefore it is that the Greeks keep only the former
which contains the decree of the synod, made on Hosius’s motion, the
suggestion having been made by Januarius the bishop:  which suggestion
makes the first of these canons.  \[I.e. Latin canon xviij.\]
