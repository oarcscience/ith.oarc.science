id="viii.iii.iii.xi-p1.1"></span>Canon XI.</span>

<span id="viii.iii.iii.xi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.xi-p2.1"></span>It</span> is decreed that virgins who
have been betrothed, and who have afterwards been carried off by others,
shall be restored to those to whom they had formerly been betrothed,
even though they may have suffered violence from the ravisher.

<span id="viii.iii.iii.xi-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.xi-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XI.</span>

<span id="viii.iii.iii.xi-p5"></span>If a young girl who is engaged be
stolen away by force by another man, let her be restored to the former.

<span id="viii.iii.iii.xi-p6"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.xi-p6.1"></span>Hefele.</span>

<span id="viii.iii.iii.xi-p7"></span>This canon treats only of betrothed
women (of the *sponsalia de futuro*) not of those who are married (of
the *sponsalia de præsenti*).  In the case of the latter there could be
no doubt as to the duty of restitution.  The man who was betrothed was,
moreover, at liberty to receive his affianced bride who had been carried
off or not.

<span id="viii.iii.iii.xi-p9"></span>Here Balsamon puts in a very proper
*cave*, viz.:  If he to whom she was espoused demand her to be his wife.

<span id="viii.iii.iii.xi-p10"></span>Compare St. Basil’s twenty-second
canon in his letter to Amphilochius, where it is so ruled.
