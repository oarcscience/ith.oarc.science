<span id="xiv.iii.xxxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xiv.iii.xxxiii-p1.1"></span>Canon XXXII.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.xxxiii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.xxxiii-p2.1"></span>Since</span> it has come to our
knowledge that in the region of Armenia they offer wine only on the Holy
Table, those who celebrate the unbloody sacrifice not mixing water with
it, adducing, as authority thereof, John Chrysostom, a doctor of the
Church, who says in his interpretation of the Gospel according to St.
Matthew:

<span id="xiv.iii.xxxiii-p3"></span>“And wherefore did he not drink
water after he was risen again, but wine?  To pluck up by the roots
another wicked heresy.  For since there are certain who use water in the
Mysteries to shew that both when he delivered the mysteries he had given
wine and that when he had risen and was setting before them a mere meal
without mys<span id="page_380">p. 380</span> <span
id="xiv.iii.xxxiii-Page_380"></span>teries, he used wine, ‘of the
fruit,’ saith he, ‘of the vine.’  But a vine produces wine, not
water.” <span id="fr_368"></span>[369](#fn_368.md)   And from this they
think the doctor overthrows the admixture of water in the holy
sacrifice.  Now, lest on the point from this time forward they be held
in ignorance, we open out the orthodox opinion of the Father.  For since
there was an ancient and wicked heresy of the Hydroparastatæ (i.e., of
those who offered water), who instead of wine used water in their
sacrifice, this divine, confuting the detestable teaching of such a
heresy, and showing that it is directly opposed to Apostolic tradition,
asserted that which has just been quoted.  For to his own church, where
the pastoral administration had been given him, he ordered that water
mixed with wine should be used at the unbloody sacrifice, so as to shew
forth the mingling of the blood and water which for the life of the
whole world and for the redemption of its sins, was poured forth from
the precious side of Christ our Redeemer; and moreover in every church
where spiritual light has shined this divinely given order is observed.

<span id="xiv.iii.xxxiii-p5"></span>For also James, the brother,
according to the flesh, of Christ our God, to whom the throne of the
church of Jerusalem first was entrusted, and Basil, the Archbishop of
the Church of Cæsarea, whose glory has spread through all the world,
when they delivered to us directions for the mystical sacrifice in
writing, declared that the holy chalice is consecrated in the Divine
Liturgy with water and wine.  And the holy Fathers who assembled at
Carthage provided in these express terms:  “That in the holy Mysteries
nothing besides the body and blood of the Lord be offered, as the Lord
himself laid down, that is bread and wine mixed with water.”  Therefore
if any bishop or presbyter shall not perform the holy action according
to what has been handed down by the Apostles, and shall not offer the
sacrifice with wine mixed with water, let him be deposed, as imperfectly
shewing forth the mystery and innovating on the things which have been
handed down.

<span id="xiv.iii.xxxiii-p6"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xiv.iii.xxxiii-p6.1"></span>Notes.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.xxxiii-p7"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.xxxiii-p7.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XXXII.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.xxxiii-p8"></span>Chrysostom, when overthrowing the
heresy of the Hydroparastatæ, says:  “When the Lord suffered and rose
again he used wine.”  The Armenians, laying hold on this, offer wine
alone, not understanding that Chrysostom himself, and Basil, and James
used wine mixed with water; and left the tradition that we should so
make the offering.  If, therefore, any one shall offer wine alone, or
water alone, and not the mixed \[chalice\] let him be deposed.

<span id="xiv.iii.xxxiii-p9"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.xxxiii-p9.1"></span>Van Espen.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.xxxiii-p10"></span>Justin Martyr in his Second
Apology, Ambrose, or whoever was the author of the books on the
Sacraments (Lib. v., cap. i.), Augustine and many others make mention of
this rite, and above all St. Cyprian, who wrote a long epistle on the
subject to Cecilius, and seeking the reason of the ceremony as a setting
forth of the union of the people, represented by the water, with Christ,
figured by the wine.

<span id="xiv.iii.xxxiii-p11"></span>Another signification of this rite
St. Augustine indicates in his sermon to Neophytes, saying:  “Take this
in bread, which hung upon the Cross:  Take this in the cup which poured
forth from the side,” that is to say blood and water.

<span id="xiv.iii.xxxiii-p12"></span>Cardinal Bona (*De Rebus
Liturgicis*, Lib. II., cap. ix., n. 3 and 4) refers to many ancient
rituals in which a similar prayer is used to that found in the Ambrosian
rite, which says as the water is poured in:  “Out of the side of Christ
there flowed forth blood and water together.  In the name of the Father,
etc.”  Bona further notes that “The Greeks twice mingle water with the
wine, once cold water, when in the prothesis they are preparing the Holy
Gifts, and the Priest pierces the bread with the holy spear, and says,
“One of the soldiers with a lance opened his side, and immediately there
flowed forth blood and water,” and the deacon pours in wine and water. 
From this it is evident that the Greeks agree with St. Augustine’s
explanation.

<span id="xiv.iii.xxxiii-p13"></span>For the second time the Greeks mix
“hot water after consecration and immediately before communion, the
deacon begging from the priest a blessing upon the warm water; and he
blesses it in these words:  ‘Blessed be the fervour of thy Saints, now
and ever and to the ages of ages.  Amen.’  Then the deacon pours the
water into the chalice, saying:  ‘The fervour of faith, full of the Holy
Spirit.’”  So Cardinal Bona as above.

<span id="xiv.iii.xxxiii-p14"></span>The third reason of this rite is
assumed by some from the fact that Christ is believed thus to have
instituted this sacrament at the <span id="page_381">p. 381</span> <span
id="xiv.iii.xxxiii-Page_381"></span>last supper; and this the synod
seems to intimate in the present canon when it says “as the Lord himself
delivered.”

<span id="xiv.iii.xxxiii-p15"></span>In this case the Greeks suppose
that this rite was also handed down by the Apostles, and this is evident
from their citing the Liturgy of St. James, which they believed to be a
genuine work of his.
