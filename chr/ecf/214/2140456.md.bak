<span id="xiv.iii.lxxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xiv.iii.lxxiii-p1.1"></span>Canon LXXII.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.lxxiii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.lxxiii-p2.1"></span>An</span> orthodox man is not permitted
to marry an heretical woman, nor an orthodox woman to be joined to an
heretical man.  But if anything of this kind appear to have been done by
any \[we require them\] to consider the marriage null, and that the
marriage be dissolved.  For it is not fitting to mingle together what
should not be mingled, nor is it right that the sheep be joined with the
wolf, nor the lot of sinners with the portion of Christ.  But if any one
shall transgress the things which we have decreed let him be cut off. 
But if any who up to this time are unbelievers and are not yet numbered
in the flock of the orthodox have contracted lawful marriage between
themselves, and if then, one choosing the right and coming to the light
of truth and the other remaining still detained by the bond of error and
not willing to behold with steady eye the divine rays, the unbelieving
woman is pleased to cohabit with the believing man, or the unbelieving
man with the believing woman, let them not be separated, according to
the divine Apostle, “for the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the
wife, and the unbelieving wife by her husband.”

<span id="xiv.iii.lxxiii-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.lxxiii-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon LXXII.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.lxxiii-p5"></span>A marriage contracted with heretics
is void.  But if they have made the contract before \[conversion\] let
them remain \[united\] if they so desire.

<span id="xiv.iii.lxxiii-p6"></span>Perhaps none of the canons of this
synod present greater and more insolvable difficulties than the
present.  It has been for long centuries the tradition of the Church
that the marriage of a baptized Christian with an unbaptized person is
null, but this canon seems to say that the same is the case if the one
party be a heretic even though baptized.  If this is what the canon
means it elevates heresy into an *impedimentum dirimens*.  Such is not
and never has been the law of the West, and such is not to-day the
practice of the Eastern church, which allows the marriage of its people
with Lutherans and with Roman Catholics and never questions the validity
of their marriages.  Van Espen thinks “the Greek commentators seem” to
think that the heretics referred to are unbaptized; I do not know
exactly why he thinks so.
