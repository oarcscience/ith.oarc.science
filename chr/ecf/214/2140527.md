id="xv.iv.iv.iv-p1.1"></span>Canon III.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.iv-p2"></span>Of Continence.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.iv-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.iv-p3.1"></span>Aurelius</span> the bishop said:  When at
the past council the matter on continency and chastity was considered,
those three grades, which by a sort of bond are joined to chastity by
their consecration, to wit bishops, presbyters, and deacons, so it
seemed that it was becoming that the sacred rulers and priests of God as
well as the Levites, or those who served at the divine sacraments,
should be continent altogether, by which they would be able with
singleness of heart to ask what they sought from the Lord:  so that what
the apostles taught and antiquity kept, that we might also keep.

id="xv.iv.iv.iv-p5.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon III.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.iv-p6"></span>Let a bishop, a presbyter, and a deacon
be chaste and continent.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.iv-p7"></span>This canon is taken from Canon ij., of
Carthage 387 or 390.
