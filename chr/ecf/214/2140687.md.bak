Council. <span id="fr_538"></span>[539](#fn_538.md) </span>

<span id="xvi.xiv.i-p3"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvi.xiv.i-p3.1"></span>Canon I.</span>

<span id="xvi.xiv.i-p4"></span>That the sacred Canons are in all things
to be observed.

<span id="xvi.xiv.i-p5"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xvi.xiv.i-p5.1"></span>The</span> pattern for those who have
received the sacerdotal dignity is found in the testimonies and
instructions laid down in the canonical constitutions, which we
receiving with a glad mind, sing unto the Lord God in the words of the
God-inspired David, saying:  “I have had as great delight in the way of
thy testimonies as in all manner of riches.”  “Thou hast commanded
righteousness as thy testimonies for ever.”  “Grant me understanding and
I shall live.”  Now if the word of prophesy bids us keep the testimonies
of God forever and to live by them, it is evident that they must abide
unshaken and without change.  Therefore Moses, the prophet of God,
speaketh after this manner:  “To them nothing is to be added, and from
them nothing is to be taken away.”  And the divine Apostle glorying in
them cries out, “which things the angels desire to look into,” and, “if
an angel preach to you anything besides that which ye have received, let
him be anathema.”  Seeing these things are so, being thus well-testified
unto us, we rejoice over them as he that hath found great spoil, and
press to our bosom with gladness the divine canons, holding fast all the
precepts of the same, complete and without change, whether they have
been set forth by the holy trumpets of the Spirit, the renowned
Apostles, or by the Six Ecumenical Councils, or by Councils locally
assembled for promulgating the decrees of the said Ecumenical Councils,
or by our holy Fathers.  For all these, being illumined by the same
Spirit, defined such things as were expedient.  Accordingly those whom
they placed under anathema, we likewise anathematize; those whom they
deposed, we also depose; those whom they excommunicated, we also
excommunicate; and those whom they delivered over to punishment, we
subject to the same penalty.  And now “let your conversation be without
covetousness,” crieth out Paul the divine Apostle, who was caught up
into the third heaven and heard unspeakable words.

<span id="xvi.xiv.i-p7"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xvi.xiv.i-p7.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon I.</span>

<span id="xvi.xiv.i-p8"></span>We gladly embrace the Divine Canons,
viz.:  those of the Holy Apostles, of the Six Ecumenical Synods, as also
of the local synods and of our Holy Fathers, as inspired by one and the
same Holy Spirit.  Whom they anathematize we also anathematize; whom
they depose, we depose; whom they cut off, we cut off; and whom they
subject to penalties, we also so subject.

<span id="xvi.xiv.i-p10"></span>(*Hist. of Dogma* \[Eng. Trans.\], Vol.
V., p. 327).

<span id="xvi.xiv.i-p11"></span>Just as at Trent, in addition to the
restoration of mediæval doctrine, a series of reforming decrees was
published, so this Synod promulgated twenty-two canons which can be
similarly described.  The attack on monachism and the constitution of
the Church had been of some use.  They are the best canons drawn up by
an Ecumenical Synod.  The bishops were enjoined to study, to live
simply, and be unselfish, and to attend to the cure of souls; the monks
to observe order, decorum, and also to be unselfish.  With the State and
the Emperor no compromise was made; on the contrary, the demands of
Maximus Confessor and John of Damascus are heard, though in muffled
tones, from the canons.

<span id="xvi.xiv.i-p12"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xvi.xiv.i-p12.1"></span>Van Espen.</span>

<span id="xvi.xiv.i-p13"></span>From the wording of this canon it is
clearly seen that by the Fathers of this Council the canons commonly
called “Apostolical” are attributed to the Apostles themselves as to
their true authors, conformably to the Trullan Synod <span
id="fr_539"></span>[540](#fn_539.md) and to the opinion then prevalent
among the Greeks.

<span id="xvi.xiv.i-p15"></span>For since the Fathers were well
persuaded that the discipline and doctrine contained in these canons
could be received and confirmed, they cared but little to enquire
anxiously who were their true authors, being content in this <span
id="page_556">p. 556</span> <span
id="xvi.xiv.i-Page_556"></span>question to follow and embrace the then
commonly received opinion, and to ascribe these canons to them, just as,
the other day, the Tridentine Synod (Sess. XXV., cap. j., De Reform)
calls these, without any explanation, the “Canons of the Apostles,”
because then as now they were commonly called by that name.

<span id="xvi.xiv.i-p16"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xvi.xiv.i-p16.1"></span>Beveridge.</span>

<span id="xvi.xiv.i-p17"></span>(*Annotat*., p. 166, at end of Vol.
II.).

<span id="xvi.xiv.i-p18"></span>Here are recognized and confirmed the
canons set forth by the Six Ecumenical Councils.  And although all agree
that the fifth and sixth Synods adopted no canons, unless that those of
the Council in Trullo be attributed to them, yet when Tarasius the
Patriarch of Constantinople claimed Canon 82 of the Trullan Canons as
having been set forth by the sixth synod (as is evident from the
annotations on that canon), all the canons of Trullo seem to be
confirmed as having issued from the Sixth Synod.  Or else, perchance, as
is supposed by Balsamon and Zonaras, as also by this present synod, the
Trullan was held to be Quinisext (<span class="Greek"><span
id="xvi.xiv.i-p18.1"></span>πενθέκτη</span>), and the canons decreed by
it to belong to both the fifth and the sixth council.  Otherwise I do
not see what meaning these words \[“of the Six Ecumenical Synods”\] can
have, for it will be remembered that the reference is to the
ecclesiastical canons of the Six Ecumenical Synods, and not to their
dogmatic decrees.
