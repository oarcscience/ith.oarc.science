the Council of Nice.</span>

<span id="vii.vii-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="vii.vii-p2.1"></span>Canon I. <span
id="fr_108"></span>[109](#fn_108.md) </span>

<span id="vii.vii-p4"></span>Insane persons and energumens should not be
ordained.

<span id="vii.vii-p5"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="vii.vii-p5.1"></span>Canon II.</span>

<span id="vii.vii-p6"></span>Bond servants are not to be ordained.

<span id="vii.vii-p7"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="vii.vii-p7.1"></span>Canon III.</span>

<span id="vii.vii-p8"></span>Neophytes in the faith are not to be
ordained to Holy Orders before they have a knowledge of Holy Scripture. 
And such, if convicted after their ordination of grave sin, are to be
deposed with those who ordained them.

<span id="vii.vii-p9"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="vii.vii-p9.1"></span>Canon IV.</span>

<span id="vii.vii-p10"></span>The cohabitation of women with bishops,
presbyters, and deacons prohibited on account of their celibacy.

<span id="vii.vii-p11"></span>We decree that bishops shall not live with
women; nor shall a presbyter who is a widower; neither shall they escort
them; nor be familiar with them, nor gaze upon them persistently.  And
the same decree is made with regard to every celibate priest, and the
same concerning such deacons as have no wives.  And this is to be the
case whether the woman be beautiful or ugly, whether a young girl or
beyond the age of puberty, whether great in birth, or an orphan taken
out of charity under pretext of bringing her up.  For the devil with
such arms slays religious, bishops, presbyters, and deacons, and incites
them to the fires of desire.  But if she be an old woman, and of
advanced age, or a sister, or mother, or aunt, or grandmother, it is
permitted to live with these because such persons are free from all
suspicion of scandal. <span id="fr_109"></span>[110](#fn_109.md)

id="vii.vii-p85.1"></span>Canon XXXIX.</span>

<span id="vii.vii-p86"></span>Of the care and power which a Patriarch
has over the bishops and archbishops of his patriarchate; and of the
primacy of the Bishop of Rome over all.

<span id="vii.vii-p87"></span>Let the patriarch consider what things are
done by the archbishops and bishops in their provinces; and if he shall
find anything done by them otherwise than it should be, let him change
it, and order it, as seemeth him fit:  for he is the father of all, and
they are his sons.  And although the archbishop be among the bishops as
an elder brother, who hath the care of his brethren, and to whom they
owe obedience because he is over them; yet the patriarch is to all those
who are under his power, just as he who holds the seat of Rome, is the
head and prince of all patriarchs; inasmuch as he is first, as was
Peter, to whom power is given over all Christian princes, and over all
their peoples, as he who is the Vicar of Christ our Lord over all
peoples and over the whole Christian Church, and whoever shall
contradict this, is excommunicated by the Synod. <span

<span id="vii.vii-p89"></span>\[I add Canon XXXVII. of Echellensis’s
*Nova Versio LXXXIV. Arabic. Canonum Conc. Nicæni*, that the reader may
compare it with the foregoing.\]

<span id="vii.vii-p90"></span>Let there be only four patriarchs in the
whole world as there are four writers of the Gospel, and four rivers,
etc.  And let there be a prince and chief over them, the lord of the see
of the Divine Peter at Rome, according as the Apostles commanded.  And
after him the lord of the great Alexandria, which is the see of Mark. 
And the third is the lord of Ephesus, which is the see of John the
Divine who speaks divine things.  And the fourth and last is my lord of
Antioch, which is another see of Peter.  And let all the bishops be
divided under the hands of these four patriarchs; and the bishops of the
little towns which are under the dominion of the great cities let them
be under the authority of these metropolitans.  But let every
metropolitan of these great cities appoint the bishops of his province,
but let none of the bishops appoint him, for he is greater than they. 
Therefore let every man know his own rank, and let him not usurp the
rank of another.  And whosoever shall contradict this law which we have
established the Fathers of the Synod subject him to anathema. <span

office of exequies.

<span id="vii.vii-p144"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="vii.vii-p144.1"></span>Canon LXVI.</span>

<span id="vii.vii-p145"></span>Of taking a second wife, after the former
one has been disowned for any cause, or even not put away, and of him
who falsely accuses his wife of adultery.  If any priest or deacon shall
put away his wife on account of her fornication, or for other cause, as
aforesaid, or cast her out of doors for external good, or that he may
change her for another more beautiful, or better, or richer, or does so
out of his lust which is displeasing to God; and after she has been put
away for any of these causes he shall contract matrimony with another,
or without having put her away shall take another, whether free or bond;
and shall have both equally, they living separately and he sleeping
every night with one or other of them, or else keeping both in the same
house and bed, let him be deposed.  If he were a layman let him be
deprived of communion.  But if anyone falsely defames his wife charging
her with adultery, so that he turns her out of doors, the matter must be
diligently examined; and if the accusation was false, he shall be
deposed if a cleric, but if a layman shall be prohibited from entering
the church and from the communion of the faithful; and shall be
compelled to live with her whom he has defamed, even though she be
deformed, and poor, and insane; and whoever shall not obey is
excommunicated by the Synod.

<span id="vii.vii-p146"></span>\[*Note*.—The reader will notice that by
this canon a husband is deposed or excommunicated, as the case may be,
if he marry another woman, after putting away his wife on account of her
adultery.  It is curious that in the parallel canon in the collection of
Echellensis, which is numbered LXXI., the reading is quite different,
although it is very awkward and inconsequent as given.  Moreover, it
should be remembered that in some codices and editions this canon is
lacking altogether, one on the right of the Pope to receive appeals
taking its place.  As this canon is of considerable length, I only quote
the interesting parts.\]

<span id="vii.vii-p147"></span>Whatever presbyter or deacon shall put
away his wife without the offence of fornica<span id="page_50">p.
50</span> <span id="vii.vii-Page_50"></span>tion, or for any other cause
of which we have spoken above, and shall cast her out of doors…such a
person shall be cast out of the clergy, if he were a clergyman; if a
layman he shall be forbidden the communion of the faithful.…But if that
woman \[untruly charged by her husband with adultery\], that is to say
his wife, spurns his society on account of the injury he has done her
and the charge he has brought against her, of which she is innocent, let
her freely be put away and let a bill of repudiation be written for her,
noting the false accusation which had been brought against her.  And
then if she should wish to marry some other faithful man, it is right
for her to do so, nor does the Church forbid it; and the same permission
extends as well to men as to women, since there is equal reason for it
for each.  But if he shall return to better fruit which is of the same
kind, and shall conciliate to himself the love and benevolence of his
consort, and shall be willing to return to his pristine friendship, his
fault shall be condoned to him after he has done suitable and sufficient
penance.  And whoever shall speak against this decree the fathers of the
synod excommunicate him.
