id="xv.vi.ii-p1.1"></span>Introductory Note.</span>

<span id="xv.vi.ii-p2"></span>It is commonly supposed by the
commentators that what follows is the “Canon of St. Cyprian” referred to
in the Second canon of the Synod in Trullo.  Johnson <span
id="fr_499"></span>[500](#fn_499) thinks that that canon comes down to
us as Canon XXXIX. of the Apostolic Canons.  Baronius <span
id="fr_500"></span>[501](#fn_500) agrees with Asseman <span
id="fr_501"></span>[502](#fn_501) in thinking that from hatred to Rome
the Greeks adopted the theory of the non-validity of heretical baptism. 
“But,” as Hefele <span id="fr_502"></span>[503](#fn_502) well remarks,
“in that case they would have contradicted themselves.”

<span id="xv.vi.ii-p7"></span>Zonaras remarks:  “This is the most
ancient of all the synods.  For that which was held at Antioch in Syria
concerning Paul of Samosata was more ancient than the others, being
holden in the time of the Roman Emperor Aurelius, but this one is still
earlier.  For the great Cyprian finished his martyr course in the time
of the Emperor Decius:  but there was a long interval between Aurelian
and Decius.  For many emperors reigned after the death of Decius, to
whom at last Aurelian succeeded on the throne.  Therefore this is by far
the most ancient of all synods.  In it moreover above eighty-four
bishops were gathered together, and considered the question as to what
was to be done about the baptism of those who came to the Church after
abandoning their heresies, and of schismatics who returned to the
Church.”
