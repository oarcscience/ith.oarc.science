<span id="xiv.iii.v-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.v-p2.1"></span>Let</span> none of those who are on the
priestly list possess any woman or maid servant, beyond those who are
enumerated in the canon as being persons free from suspicion, preserving
himself hereby from being implicated in any blame.  But if anyone
transgresses our decree let him be deposed.  And let eunuchs also
observe the same rule, that by foresight they may be free of censure. 
But those who transgress, let them be deposed, if indeed they are
clerics; but if laymen let them be excommunicated.
