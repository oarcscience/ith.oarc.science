<span id="viii.vii.ii-Page_124"></span><span class="c4"><span

<span id="viii.vii.ii-p2"></span>The Laodicea at which the Synod met is
Laodicea in Phrygia Pacatiana, also called Laodicea ad Lycum, and to be
carefully distinguished from the Laodicea in Syria.  This much is
certain, but as to the exact date of the Synod there is much
discussion.  Peter de Marca fixed it at the year 365, but Pagi in his
*Critica* on Baronius’s *Annals* <span id="fr_171"></span>[172](#fn_171.md)
seems to have overthrown the arguments upon which de Marca rested, and
agrees with Gothofred in placing it *circa* 363.  At first sight it
would seem that the Seventh Canon gave a clue which would settle the
date, inasmuch as the Photinians are mentioned, and Bishop Photinus
began to be prominent in the middle of the fourth century and was
anathematized by the Eusebians in a synod at Antioch in 344, and by the
orthodox at Milan in 345; and finally, after several other
condemnations, he died in banishment in 366.  But it is not quite
certain whether the word “Photinians” is not an interpolation. 
Something with regard to the date may perhaps be drawn from the word
<span class="Greek"><span id="viii.vii.ii-p3.2"></span>Πακατιανῆς</span>
as descriptive of Phrygia, for it is probable that this division was not
yet made at the time of the Sardican Council in 343.  Hefele concludes
that “Under such circumstances, it is best, with Remi Ceillier,
Tillemont, and others, to place the meeting of the synod of Laodicea
generally somewhere between the years 343 and 381, i.e., between the
Sardican and the Second Ecumenical Council—and to give up the attempt to
discover a more exact date.” <span id="fr_172"></span>[173](#fn_172.md)

<span id="viii.vii.ii-p5"></span>But since the traditional position of
the canons of this Council is after those of Antioch and immediately
before those of First Constantinople, I have followed this order.  Such
is their position in “very many old collections of the Councils which
have had their origin since the sixth or even in the fifth century,”
says Hefele.  It is true that Matthew Blastares places these canons
after those of Sardica, but the Quinisext Synod in its Second Canon and
Pope Leo IV., according to the *Corpus Juris Canonici*, <span
id="fr_173"></span>[174](#fn_173.md) give them the position which they hold
in this volume.

Baronius’s view that this synod was held before that of Nice because the
book of Judith is not mentioned among the books of the O.T., and because
its canons are sometimes identical with those of Nice, is universally
rejected.
