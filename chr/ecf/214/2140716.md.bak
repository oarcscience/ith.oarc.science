<span id="xvi.xviii.iv-p1"></span> IV.  *The Chief Cause of Trouble a
Logomachy*.

<span id="xvi.xviii.iv-p2"></span>Now from all this one thing is
abundantly clear, that the great point set forth with such learning and
perspicuity by the Seventh Synod, to wit, the distinction between <span
class="Greek"><span id="xvi.xviii.iv-p2.1"></span>λατρεία</span> and
<span class="Greek"><span
id="xvi.xviii.iv-p2.2"></span>προσκύνεσις</span> was wholly lost upon
these Frankish writers; and that their translation of both words by
“*adoro*” gave rise to nine-tenths of the trouble that followed.  The
student of ecclesiastical history will remember how a similar logomachy
followed nearly every one of the Ecumenical Synods, and will not
therefore be astonished to find it likewise here.  The “homousion,” the
“theotocos,” the “two natures,” “the two wills,” each one gave rise to
heated discussion in different sections of the Church, even after it had
been accepted and approved by a Synod which no one now for an instant
disputes to have been ecumenical.

<span id="xvi.xviii.iv-p3"></span>Moreover, that after this serious
error and bungling on the part of the Caroline divines and of the French
and Allemanic Churches, the Pope did not proceed to enforce the
acceptance of the council will not cause astonishment to any who are
familiar with what St. Athanasius said with regard to the Semi-Arians,
who even after I. Nice refused to use the word “*homousios*;” or with
the extreme gentleness and moderation of St. Cyril of Alexandria in his
treatment of John of Antioch.

<span id="xvi.xviii.iv-p4"></span>Perhaps before leaving the subject I
should give here the chief strictures which Hefele makes upon these
books (§ 400).

<span id="xvi.xviii.iv-p5"></span>(1)  The Caroline Books condemn
passages which they quote (without saying so) from Pope Hadrian’s own
letter to the Empress.

<span id="xvi.xviii.iv-p6"></span><span id="page_583">p. 583</span>
<span id="xvi.xviii.iv-Page_583"></span>(2)  They blame St. Basil for
teaching that the reverence done to the image passes on to the
prototype.

<span id="xvi.xviii.iv-p7"></span>(3)  They treat St. Gregory Nyssen
with contempt, and refuse to listen to him (Lib. II., c. xvij.).

<span id="xvi.xviii.iv-p8"></span>(4)  They are full of most careless
and inexcusable blunders.

<span id="xvi.xviii.iv-p9"></span>(a)  They attribute to the Emperors a
phrase which belongs to the Synod (I. j.).

<span id="xvi.xviii.iv-p10"></span>(b)  They confound Leontius with John
(I. xxj.).

<span id="xvi.xviii.iv-p11"></span>(c)  They confound Tarasius with
Theodore of Jerusalem (III. v.).

<span id="xvi.xviii.iv-p12"></span>(d)  They impute to the Council the
opinions of the Iconoclastic Conciliabulum (IV., xiv. and xx. ).

<span id="xvi.xviii.iv-p13"></span>(e)  They attribute to Epiphanius the
deacon the propositions of others when he merely read (IV., xv.)

<span id="xvi.xviii.iv-p14"></span>It had usually been supposed that
these Four Books were the “quædam capitula” which Charlemagne had sent
by Angelbert to Pope Hadrian “to be corrected by his judgment (*ut
illius judicio corrigerentur*).  Considering the nature of the contents
of the Caroline Books as we now have them, such would seem *à priori*
highly improbable, but this matter has been practically settled, as we
have already pointed out, by Bishop Hefele, who has shown from Pope
Hadrian’s answer “correcting” those “capitula,” that they must have been
entirely different in order though no doubt their contents were
similar.  The differing views of Petavius and Walch will be found in
full in Hefele (§ 401).

<span id="xvi.xviii.iv-p15"></span>In concluding his masterly treatment
of this whole matter, Hefele makes (§ 402) a remark well worthy of
repetition in this place:

<span id="xvi.xviii.iv-p16"></span>“The great friendship which Charles
shewed to Pope Hadrian down to the hour of his death proves that their
way of thinking with regard to the cultus of images was not so opposite
as many suppose, and—above all—as many have tried to make out.”

<span id="xvi.xviii.iv-p17"></span>I shall close this matter with the
admirably learned and judicious words of Michaud.

<span id="xvi.xviii.iv-p18"></span>“No doubt there had been abuses in
connexion with the worship of images; but the Council of Nice never
approved of these.  No doubt, too, certain marks of veneration used in
the East were not practised in Gaul; but the Council of Nice did not go
into these particulars.  It merely determined the principle, to wit, the
lawfulness and moral necessity of honouring the holy images; and in
doing this it did not in any degree innovate.  Charlemagne ought to have
known this, for, already in the sixth century Fortunatus, in his Poem on
St. Martin, tells how in Gaul they lighted lamps before the
images. <span id="fr_549"></span>[550](#fn_549.md)   The great point that
Charlemagne made was that what was called in the West ‘adoration,’ in
the strict sense (that is to say the worship of Latria) should be
rendered to none other than God; now this is exactly the doctrine of the
Council of Nice.  Charlemagne himself admits that the learned may
venerate images, meaning thereby that the veneration is really addressed
to the prototypes, but that such veneration is a source of scandal to
the ignorant who in the image venerate <span
id="fr_550"></span>[551](#fn_550.md) nothing but the material image itself
(Lib. III., cap. xvj.).” <span id="fr_551"></span>[552](#fn_551.md)
