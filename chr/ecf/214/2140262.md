Emmanuel is very God, and that therefore the Holy Virgin is the Mother
of God (<span class="Greek"><span

bore the Word of God made flesh \[as it is written, “The Word was made
flesh”\] let him be anathema.

<span id="x.ix.i-p6"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="x.ix.i-p6.1"></span>The Anathematisms of the Heretic Nestorius
Against Cyril.</span>

<span id="x.ix.i-p7"></span>(*Found best in Migne’s edition of Marius
Mercator*.)

<span id="x.ix.i-p8"></span>I.

<span id="x.ix.i-p9"></span>If anyone says that the Emmanuel is true
God, and not rather God with us, that is, that he has united himself to
a like nature with ours, which he assumed from the Virgin Mary, and
dwelt in it; and if anyone calls Mary the mother of God the Word, and
not rather mother of him who is Emmanuel; and if he maintains that God
the Word has changed himself into the flesh, which he only assumed in
order to make his Godhead visible, and to be found in form as a man, let
him be anathema.

<span id="x.ix.i-p10"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="x.ix.i-p10.1"></span>Petavius.</span> <span
id="fr_244"></span>[245](#fn_244.md)

<span id="x.ix.i-p12"></span>(*De Incarnatione*, Lib. vj. cap. xvij.)

<span id="x.ix.i-p13"></span>In this anathematism certain words are
found in the Greek copy of Dionysius which are lacking in the ordinary
copies, viz. “according as it is written, ‘And the Word was made
flesh’;” unless forsooth Dionysius supplied them of his own authority. 
For in the Lateran Synod in the time of Martin I. this anathematism was
quoted without the appended words.

<span id="x.ix.i-p14"></span>This anathematism breaks to pieces the
chief strength of the Nestorian impiety.  For it sets forth two facts. 
The one that the Emmanuel, that is he who was born of a woman and dwelt
with us, is God:  the other, that Mary who bare such an one is Mother of
God.  That Christ is God is clearly proved from the Nicene Creed, and he
shews that the same that was in the beginning the Son of God, afterwards
took flesh and was born of Mary, without any change or confusion of
natures.

<span id="x.ix.i-p15"></span>St. Cyril explains that by <span
class="Greek"><span id="x.ix.i-p15.1"></span>σαρκικῶς</span>,
*carnaliter*, he meant nothing else than <span class="Greek"><span
id="x.ix.i-p15.2"></span>κατα σάρκα</span>, *secundum carnem*,
“according to the flesh.”  And it was necessary to use this expression
to overthrow the perfidy of Nestorius; so that we may understand that
the most holy Virgin was the parent not of a simple and bare man, but of
God the Word, not in that he was God, but in that he had taken flesh. 
For God the Father was the parent of the same Son <span
class="Greek"><span id="x.ix.i-p15.3"></span>θεϊκῶς</span> <span
id="fr_245"></span>[246](#fn_245) (divinely.md) as his mother was <span
class="Greek"><span id="x.ix.i-p16.2"></span>σαρκικῶς</span> (after the
flesh).  And the word (<span class="Greek"><span
id="x.ix.i-p16.3"></span>σαρκικῶς</span>) in no degree lessens the
dignity of his begetting and bringing forth; for it shews that his flesh
was not simulated or shadowed forth; but true and like to ours. 
Amphilochius distinctly uses the word, saying “Except he had been born
carnally (<span class="Greek"><span
id="x.ix.i-p16.4"></span>σαρκικῶς</span>), never wouldest thou have been
born spiritually (<span class="Greek"><span
id="x.ix.i-p16.5"></span>πνευματικῶς</span> ).”  Cf. St. Gregory
Nazianzen (*Orat.* 51).

<span id="x.ix.i-p17"></span>Theodoret misunderstood St. Cyril to teach
in this first anathematism that the Word was changed into the flesh he
assumed.  But Cyril rightly treated this whole accusation as a foolish
calumny.
