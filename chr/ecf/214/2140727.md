<span id="xvii.vii-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.vii-p2.1"></span>The Canonical Epistle of St. Gregory,
Archbishop of Neocæsarea, who is called Thaumaturgus, concerning Them
that, During the Incursion of the Barbarians, Ate of Things Offered to
Idols and Committed Certain Other Sins. <span
id="fr_588"></span>[589](#fn_588) </span>

<span id="xvii.vii-p4"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.vii-p4.1"></span>Canon I.</span>

<span id="xvii.vii-p5"></span>That they who have been taken captives by
the barbarians, and have eaten with them, be not treated as persons that
have eaten things offered to idols; especially because it is universally
reported, that they do not sacrifice to idols; nor shall those women who
have been ravished by them, be treated as guilty of fornication, unless
they were before of lewd lives.

<span id="xvii.vii-p6"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.vii-p6.1"></span>Canon II.</span>

<span id="xvii.vii-p7"></span>That those Christians who plundered their
brethren during the invasion, be excommunicated, lest wrath come on the
people, and especially on the presidents, <span
id="fr_589"></span>[590](#fn_589) who enquire not into these matters.

<span id="xvii.vii-p9"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.vii-p9.1"></span>Canons III., IV., V.</span>

<span id="xvii.vii-p10"></span>The pretence of having found those goods,
or that they themselves lost things of equal value, shall stand them in
no stead, but that they be excluded from prayer. <span
id="fr_590"></span>[591](#fn_590)

<span id="xvii.vii-p12"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.vii-p12.1"></span>Canon VI.</span>

<span id="xvii.vii-p13"></span>Against those who detain them prisoners
who had escaped from the barbarians, the holy man <span
id="fr_591"></span>[592](#fn_591) expects that such should be
thunder-struck, and therefore desires that some enquiry be made upon the
spot by persons sent for this purpose.

<span id="xvii.vii-p15"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.vii-p15.1"></span>Canon VII.</span>

<span id="xvii.vii-p16"></span>That they who joined the barbarians in
their murder and ravages, or were guides or informers to them, be not
permitted to be hearers, till holy men assembled together do agree in
common upon what shall seem good, first to the Holy Ghost, then to
themselves.

<span id="xvii.vii-p17"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.vii-p17.1"></span>Canon VIII.</span>

<span id="xvii.vii-p18"></span>But if they discover themselves, and make
restitution, they shall be admitted to be Prostrators.

<span id="xvii.vii-p19"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.vii-p19.1"></span>Canon IX.</span>

<span id="xvii.vii-p20"></span>They that are convicted to have found
(though in their own houses) anything \[of their neighbours’\] left by
the barbarians shall also be Prostrators; but if they shall confess
themselves they shall communicate in prayer.

<span id="xvii.vii-p21"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.vii-p21.1"></span>Canon X.</span>

<span id="xvii.vii-p22"></span>This last privilege is restrained to such
as demand nothing as a reward for their discovery, and salvage, or under
any pretence whatsoever.

<span id="xvii.vii-p23"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.vii-p23.1"></span>Canon XI.</span>

<span id="xvii.vii-p24"></span>The station of Mourners is without the
gate of the oratory; the station of the Hearers is within the oratory,
in the porch with the catechumens; the station of Prostrators is within
the door of the temple; the station of Co-standers is among the
communicants; the last is the participation of Holy Mysteries. <span

id="xvii.vii-p2.2"></span>

<span id="xvii.vii-p3"></span> Johnson says this was about the year of
grace 240, after the Goths had ravaged Asia, during the reign of
Galienus.  The letter, he thinks, was an Encyclical sent to every bishop
of his province, by Euphrosynus, who was one of these bishops and whom
he calls his “old friend.”  In the beginning of the letter he addresses
each one of the bishops as “most holy pope.”

<span id="fn_589"></span>[602:590](2140727.htm#fr_589) <span
id="xvii.vii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.vii-p8"></span> I.e., the bishops, cf. St. Justin Martyr,
Tertullian, etc.

<span id="fn_590"></span>[602:591](2140727.htm#fr_590) <span
id="xvii.vii-p10.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.vii-p11"></span> Literally “abdicate from Prayers.” 
Johnson explains this to mean that they became Prostrators.

<span id="fn_591"></span>[602:592](2140727.htm#fr_591) <span
id="xvii.vii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.vii-p14"></span> I.e., St. Gregory.

<span id="fn_592"></span>[602:593](2140727.htm#fr_592) <span
id="xvii.vii-p24.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.vii-p25"></span> Johnson has a note that this canon is
not “St. Gregory’s but an addition by some other hand.”
