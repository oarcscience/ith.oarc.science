<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxviii-p2"></span>Of the letters to be sent to the
judges, that they may take note of the things done between the Donatists
and the Maximianists.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxviii-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.lxviii-p3.1"></span>Therefore</span> it seemed good that
letters should be given from our council to the African judges, from
whom it would seem suitable that this should be sought, that in this
matter they would aid the common mother, the Catholic Church, that the
episcopal authority may be fortified <span

their judicial power and with diligence out of their Christian faith,

<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxviii-p7"></span>The secular arm must be implored by
synodal letters to assist our common Mother the Catholic Church against
those by whom the authority of the bishop is despised.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxviii-p10"></span>Maximianists were a sect bred out
of the Donatists, and separating from them.
