<span id="vii.vi.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="vii.vi.xvi-p1.1"></span>Canon XI.</span>

<span id="vii.vi.xvi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="vii.vi.xvi-p2.1"></span>Concerning</span> those who have fallen
without compulsion, without the spoiling of their property, without
danger or the like, as happened during the tyranny of Licinius, the
Synod declares that, though they have deserved no clemency, they shall
be dealt with mercifully.  As many as were communicants, if they
heartily repent, shall pass three years among the hearers; for seven
years they shall be prostrators; and for two years they shall
communicate with the people in prayers, but without oblation.

<span id="vii.vi.xvi-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="vii.vi.xvi-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XI.</span>

<span id="vii.vi.xvi-p5"></span>As many as fell without necessity, even
if therefore undeserving of indulgence, yet some indulgence shall be
shown them and they shall be prostrators for twelve years.

<span id="vii.vi.xvi-p6"></span>On the expression “without oblation”
(<span class="Greek"><span id="vii.vi.xvi-p6.1"></span>χωρις
προσφορᾶς</span>) see the notes to Ancyra, Canon V. where the matter is
treated at some length.

<span id="vii.vi.xvi-p7"></span><span class="sc"><span

<span id="vii.vi.xvi-p8"></span>The usual position of the hearers was
just inside the church door.  But Zonaras (and Balsamon agrees with
him), in his comment on this canon, says, “they are ordered for three
years to be hearers, or to stand without the church in the narthex.”

<span id="vii.vi.xvi-p9"></span>I have read “as many as were
communicants” (<span class="Greek"><span id="vii.vi.xvi-p9.1"></span>οἱ
πιστοὶ</span>) thus following Dr. Routh.  <span id="page_25">p.
25</span> <span id="vii.vi.xvi-Page_25"></span>*Vide* his *Opuscula*. 
Caranza translates in his *Summary of the Councils* “if they were
faithful” and seems to have read <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.vi.xvi-p9.2"></span>εἰ πιστοὶ</span>, which is much simpler and
makes better sense.

<span id="vii.vi.xvi-p10"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="vii.vi.xvi-p10.1"></span>Zonaras.</span>

<span id="vii.vi.xvi-p11"></span>The prostrators stood within the body
of the church behind the ambo \[*i.e.* the reading desk\] and went out
with the catechumens.
