number, according to the canon, even if the city be great.  Of this you
will be persuaded from the Book of the Acts.

<span id="viii.iv.iii.xv-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iv.iii.xv-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XV.</span>

<span id="viii.iv.iii.xv-p5"></span>Seven Deacons according to the Acts
of the Apostles should be appointed for each great city.

<span id="viii.iv.iii.xv-p6"></span>This canon was observed in Rome and
it was not until the xith century that the number of the Seven Cardinal
Deacons was changed to fourteen.  That Gratian received it into the
*Decretum* (Pars. I., Dist. XCIII., c. xij.) is good evidence that he
considered it part of the Roman discipline.  Eusebius <span
id="fr_127"></span>[128](#fn_127) gives a letter of Pope Cornelius,
written about the middle of the third century, which says that at that
time there were at Rome forty-four priests, seven deacons, and seven
subdeacons; and that the number of those in inferior orders was very
great.  Thomassinus says that, “no doubt in this the Roman Church
intended to imitate the Apostles who only ordained seven deacons.  But
the other Churches did not keep themselves so scrupulously to that
number.” <span id="fr_128"></span>[129](#fn_128)

<span id="viii.iv.iii.xv-p9"></span>In the acts of the Council of
Chalcedon it is noted that the Church of Edessa had fifteen priests and
thirty-eight deacons. <span id="fr_129"></span>[130](#fn_129)   And
Justinian, we know, appointed one hundred deacons for the Church of
Constantinople.  Van Espen well points out that while this canon refers
to a previous law on the subject, neither the Council itself, nor the
Greek commentators Balsamon or Zonaras give the least hint as to what
that Canon was.

<span id="viii.iv.iii.xv-p11"></span>The Fathers of Neocæsarea base
their limiting of the number of deacons to seven in one city upon the
authority of Holy Scripture, but the sixteenth canon of the Quinisext
Council expressly says that in doing so they showed they referred to
ministers of alms, not to ministers at the divine mysteries, and that
St. Stephen and the rest were not deacons at all in this latter sense. 
The reader is referred to this canon, where to defend the practice of
Constantinople the meaning of the canon we are considering is entirely
misrepresented.
