<span id="viii.v.iv.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="viii.v.iv.xiii-p1.1"></span>Canon XIII.</span>

<span id="viii.v.iv.xiii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.v.iv.xiii-p2.1"></span>If</span> any woman, under pretence of
asceticism, shall change her apparel and, instead of a woman’s
accustomed clothing, shall put on that of a man, let her be anathema.

<span id="viii.v.iv.xiii-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.v.iv.xiii-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XIII.</span>

<span id="viii.v.iv.xiii-p5"></span>Whatever women wear men’s clothes,
anathema to them.

<span id="viii.v.iv.xiii-p6"></span><span class="sc"><span

<span id="viii.v.iv.xiii-p7"></span>The synodal letter in its sixth
article also speaks of this.  Exchange of dress, or the adoption by one
sex of the dress of the other, was forbidden in the Pentateuch ([Deut.
xxii. 5](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#005.md)<span
id="viii.v.iv.xiii-p7.1"></span>), and was therefore most strictly
interdicted by the whole ancient Church.  Such <span id="page_98">p.
98</span> <span id="viii.v.iv.xiii-Page_98"></span>change of attire was
formerly adopted mainly for theatrical purposes, or from effeminacy,
wantonness, the furtherance of unchastity, or the like.  The
Eustathians, from quite opposite and hyper-ascetical reasons, had
recommended women to assume male, that is probably monk’s attire, in
order to show that for them, as the holy ones, there was no longer any
distinction of sex; but the Church, also from ascetical reasons, forbade
this change of attire, especially when joined to superstition and
puritanical pride.

<span id="viii.v.iv.xiii-p8"></span>This canon is found in the *Corpus
Juris Canonici*, Gratian’s *Decretum*, Pars I., Dist. xxx., c. vi.
