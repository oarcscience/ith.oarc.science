<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxxv-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.lxxv-p1.1"></span>Canon LXXIV.  (Greek lxxvii.)</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxxv-p2"></span>That no bishop who is an intercessor
is to hold the see where he is intercessor.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxxv-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.lxxv-p3.1"></span>Item</span>, it has been decreed that it
is not lawful to any intercessor to retain the see to which he has been
appointed as intercessor, by any popular movements and seditions; but
let him take care that within a year he provide them with a bishop:  but
if he shall neglect to do so, when the year is done, another intercessor
shall be appointed.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxxv-p5"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.lxxv-p5.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon LXXIV.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxxv-p6"></span>It seemed good that the bishop who
had been called in as an intercessor, by the zeal and dissensions of the
people, should not be allowed to become the occupant of its throne:  but
let a bishop be provided within a year, or else in the next year let
another intercessor be appointed.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxxv-p7"></span>This is Canon IX. of Carthage,
September, <span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.lxxv-p7.1"></span>a.d.</span> 401.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxxv-p9"></span>We here call this officer “Guardian
of the spiritualities” in the vacancy of the see.
