<span id="viii.iv.iii.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="viii.iv.iii.xiii-p1.1"></span>Canon XIII.</span>

<span id="viii.iv.iii.xiii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iv.iii.xiii-p2.1"></span>Country</span> presbyters may not make
the oblation in the church of the city when the bishop or presbyters of
the city are present; nor may they give the Bread or the Cup with
prayer.  If, however, they be absent, and he \[*i.e*., a country
presbyter\] alone be called to prayer, he may give them.

<span id="viii.iv.iii.xiii-p3"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="viii.iv.iii.xiii-p3.1"></span>Notes.</span>

<span id="viii.iv.iii.xiii-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iv.iii.xiii-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canons XIII. and
XIV.</span>

<span id="viii.iv.iii.xiii-p5"></span>A country presbyter shall not
offer in the city temple, unless the bishop and the whole body of the
presbyters are away.  But if wanted he can do so while they are away. 
The chorepiscopi can offer as fellow ministers, as they hold the place
of the Seventy.

<span id="viii.iv.iii.xiii-p6"></span>Routh reads the last clause in the
plural, in this agreeing with Dionysius Exiguus and Isidore.  In many
<span class="sc"><span id="viii.iv.iii.xiii-p6.1"></span>mss.</span>
this canon is united with the following and the whole number given as
14.

<span id="viii.iv.iii.xiii-p7"></span>This canon is found in the *Corpus
Juris Canonici*, Pars I., Dist. xcv., c. xii.  And the Roman correctors
have added the following notes.

<span id="viii.iv.iii.xiii-p9"></span>(Gratian *ut supra*.)

<span id="viii.iv.iii.xiii-p10"></span>“Nor to give the sacrificed bread
and to hand the chalice;” otherwise it is read “sanctified”
\[*sanctificatum* for *sacrificatum*\].  The Greek of the council is
<span class="Greek"><span id="viii.iv.iii.xiii-p10.1"></span>ἄρτον
διδόναι ἐν εὐχῇ</span>; but Balsamon has <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.iv.iii.xiii-p10.2"></span>ἄρτον εὐχῆς</span>, that is, “the
bread of the mystic prayer.”

<span id="viii.iv.iii.xiii-p11"></span>Instead of “let them only who are
called for giving the prayer, etc.,” read <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.iv.iii.xiii-p11.1"></span>καὶ εἰς εὐχὴν κληθῇ μόνος
δίδωσιν</span>, that is:  “and only he that shall have been called to
the mystic prayer, shall distribute.”
