<span id="xv.iv.iv.xv-Page_449"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xv-p1.1"></span>Canon XIV.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xv-p2"></span>That one of the bishops of Tripoli
should come as legate, and that a presbyter might be heard there by five
bishops.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xv-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xv-p3.1"></span>It</span> also seemed good that one bishop
from Tripoli, on account of the poverty of the province, should come as
a legation, and that there a presbyter might be heard by five bishops,
and a deacon by three, as has been noted above, his own bishop
presiding.

id="xv.iv.iv.xv-p5.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XIV.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xv-p6"></span>On account of the scarcity of bishops
in Tripoli, one bishop shall suffice for a legation.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xv-p7"></span>This canon is made up of two parts. 
The first part is Canon v. of the synod of Hippo, <span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xv-p7.1"></span>a.d.</span> 393, and was repeated at the
Carthaginian synod of 397.  The second half is from Canon viij. of the
same council.

id="xv.iv.iv.xv-p8.1"></span>Johnson</span> (*See Canon* 12).

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xv-p9"></span>“Legate,” i.e., to a Synod, there being
few bishops in that province.
