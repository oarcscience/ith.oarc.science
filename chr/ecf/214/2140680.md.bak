id="xvi.viii-p1.1"></span>Extracts from the Acts.</span>

<span id="xvi.viii-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvi.viii-p2.1"></span>Session IV.</span>

<span id="xvi.viii-p3"></span>\[*Among numerous passages of the Fathers
one was read from a sermon by St. Gregory Nyssen in which he describes a
painting representing the sacrifice of Isaac and tells how he could not
pass it “without tears.”*\]

<span id="xvi.viii-p4"></span>The most glorious princes said:  See how
our father grieved at the depicted history, even so that he wept.

<span id="xvi.viii-p5"></span>Basil, the most holy bishop of Ancyra,
said:  Many times the father had read the story, but perchance he had
not wept; but when once he saw it painted, he wept.

<span id="xvi.viii-p6"></span>John the most reverend monk and presbyter
and representative of the Eastern high priests, said:  If to such a
doctor the picture was helpful and drew forth tears, how much more in
the case of the ignorant and simple will it bring compunction and
benefit.

<span id="xvi.viii-p7"></span>The holy Synod said:  We have seen in
several places the history of Abraham painted as the father says.

<span id="xvi.viii-p8"></span>Theodore the most holy bishop of Catanea,
said:  If the holy Gregory, vigilant <span
id="fr_525"></span>[526](#fn_525.md) in divine cogitation, was moved to
tears at the sight of the story of Abraham, how much more shall a
painting of the incarnation of our Lord Christ, who for us was made man,
<span id="page_540">p. 540</span> <span
id="xvi.viii-Page_540"></span>move the beholders to their profit and to
tears?

<span id="xvi.viii-p10"></span>Tarasius the most holy Patriarch said: 
Shall we not weep when we see an image of our crucified Lord?

<span id="xvi.viii-p11"></span>The holy Synod said:  We shall indeed—for
in that shall be found perfectly the profundity of the abasement of the
incarnate God for our sakes.

<span id="xvi.viii-p12"></span>\[*Post nonnulla a passage is read from
St. Athanasius in which he describes the miracles worked at Berytus,
after which there is found the following* (col. 224),\]

<span id="xvi.viii-p13"></span>Tarasius, the most holy Patriarch, said: 
But perhaps someone will say, Why do not the images which we have work
miracles?  To which we answer, that as the Apostle has said, signs are
for those who do not believe, not for believers.  For they who
approached that image were unbelievers.  Therefore God gave them a sign
through the image, to draw them to our Christian faith.  But “an evil
and adulterous generation that seeketh after a sign and no sign shall be
given it.”

<span id="xvi.viii-p14"></span>\[*After a number of other quotations,
was read the Canon of the Council in Trullo as a canon of the Sixth
Synod* (col. 233).\]

<span id="xvi.viii-p15"></span>Tarasius, the most holy Patriarch said: 
There are certain affected with the sickness of ignorance who are
scandalized by these canons \[viz. of the Trullan Synod\] and say, And
do you really think they were adopted at the Sixth Synod?  Now let all
such know that the holy great Sixth Synod was assembled at
Constantinople concerning those who said that there was but one energy
and will in Christ.  These anathematized the heretics, and having
expounded the orthodox faith, they went to their homes in the fourteenth
year of Constantine.  But after four or five years the same <span
id="fr_526"></span>[527](#fn_526.md) fathers came together under Justinian,
the son of Constantine, and set forth the before-mentioned canons.  And
let no one doubt concerning them.  For they who subscribed under
Constantine were the same as they who under Justinian signed the present
chart, as can manifestly be established from the unchangeable similarity
of their own handwriting.  For it was right that they who had appeared
at an ecumenical synod should also set forth ecclesiastical canons. 
They said that we should be led as (by the hand) by the venerable images
to the recollection of the incarnation of Christ and of his saving
death, and if by them we are led to the realization of the incarnation
of Christ our God, what sort of an opinion shall we have of them who
break down the venerable images?

<span id="xvi.viii-p17"></span>\[*At the close of the Session, after a
number of anathematisms had been pronounced, the following was read, to
which all the bishops subscribed* (col. 317).\]

<span id="xvi.viii-p18"></span>Fulfilling the divine precept of our God
and Saviour Jesus Christ, our holy Fathers did not hide the light of the
divine knowledge given by him to them under a bushel, but they set it
upon the candlestick of most useful teaching, so that it might give
light to all in the house—that is to say, to those who are born in the
Catholic Church; lest perchance anyone of those who piously confess the
Lord might strike his foot against the stone of heretical evil
doctrine.  For they expelled every error of heretics and they cut off
the rotten member if it was incurably sick.  And with a fan they purged
the floor.  And the good wheat, that is to say the word which nourisheth
and which maketh strong the heart of man, they laid up in the granary of
the Catholic Church; but throwing outside the chaff of heretical evil
opinion they burned it with unquenchable fire.  Therefore also this holy
and ecumenical Synod, met together for the second time in this
illustrious metropolis of Nice, by the will of God and at the bidding of
our pious and most faithful Emperors, Irene a new Helena, and a new
Constantine, her God-protected offspring, having considered by their
perusal the teachings of our approved and blessed Fathers, hath
glorified God himself, from whom there was given to them wisdom for our
instruction, and for the perfecting of the Catholic and Apostolic
Church:  and against those who do not believe as they did, but have
attempted to overshadow the truth through their novelty, they have
chanted the words of the psalm: <span id="fr_527"></span>[528](#fn_527.md)
  “Oh how much evil have thine enemies done <span id="page_541">p.
541</span> <span id="xvi.viii-Page_541"></span>in thy sanctuary; and
have glorified themselves, saying, There is not a teacher any more, and
they shall not know that we treated with guile the word of truth.”  But
we, in all things holding the doctrines and precepts of the same our
God-bearing Fathers, make proclamation with one mouth and one heart,
neither adding anything, nor taking anything away from those things
which have been delivered to us by them.  But in these things we are
strengthened, in these things we are confirmed.  Thus we confess, thus
we teach, just as the holy and ecumenical six Synods have decreed and
ratified.  We believe in one God the Father Almighty, maker of all
things visible and invisible; and in one Lord Jesus Christ, his
only-begotten Son and Word, through whom all things were made, and in
the Holy Ghost, the Lord and giver of life, consubstantial and coeternal
with the same Father and with his Son who hath had no beginning.  The
unbuilt-up, indivisible, incomprehensible, and non-circumscribed
Trinity; he, wholly and alone, is to be worshipped and revered with
adoration; one Godhead, one Lordship, one dominion, one realm and
dynasty, which without division is apportioned to the Persons, and is
fitted to the essence severally.  For we confess that one of the same
holy and consubstantial Trinity, our Lord Jesus Christ the true God, in
these last days was incarnate and made man for our salvation, and having
saved our race through his saving incarnation, and passion, and
resurrection, and ascension into heaven; and having delivered us from
the error of idols; as also the prophet says, Not an ambassador, not an
angel, but the Lord himself hath saved us.  Him we also follow, and
adopt his voice, and cry aloud; No Synod, no power of kings, no
God-hated agreement hath delivered the Church from the error of the
idols, as the Jewdaizing conciliabulum hath madly dreamed, which raved
against the venerable images; but the Lord of glory himself, the
incarnate God, hath saved us and hath snatched us from idolatrous
deceit.  To him therefore be glory, to him be thanks, to him be
eucharists, to him be praise, to him be magnificence.  For his
redemption and his salvation alone can perfectly save, and not that of
other men who come of the earth.  For he himself hath fulfilled for us,
upon whom the ends of the earth are come through the economy of his
incarnation, the words spoken beforehand by his prophets, for he dwelt
among us, and went in and out among us, and cast out the names of idols
from the earth, as it was written.  But we salute the voices of the Lord
and of his Apostles through which we have been taught to honour in the
first place her who is properly and truly the Mother of God and exalted
above all the heavenly powers; also the holy and angelic powers; and the
blessed and altogether lauded Apostles, and the glorious Prophets and
the triumphant Martyrs which fought for Christ, and the holy and
God-bearing Doctors, and all holy men; and to seek for their
intercessions, as able to render us at home with the all-royal God of
all, so long as we keep his commandments, and strive to live
virtuously.  Moreover we salute the image of the honourable and
life-giving Cross, and the holy reliques of the Saints; and we receive
the holy and venerable images:  and we salute them, and we embrace them,
according to the ancient traditions of the holy Catholic Church of God,
that is to say of our holy Fathers, who also received these things and
established them in all the most holy Churches of God, and in every
place of his dominion.  These honourable and venerable images, as has
been said, we honour and salute and reverently venerate:  to wit, the
image of the incarnation of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ, and
that of our spotless Lady the all-holy Mother of God, from whom he
pleased to take flesh, and to save and deliver us from all impious
idolatry; also the images of the holy and incorporeal Angels, who as men
appeared to the just.  Likewise also the figures and effigies of the
divine and all-lauded Apostles, also of the God-speaking Prophets, and
of the struggling Martyrs and of holy men.  So that through their
representations we may be able to be led back in memory and recollection
to the prototype, and have a share in the holiness of some one of them.

<span id="xvi.viii-p20"></span>Thus we have learned to think of these
things, and we have been strengthened by our holy Fathers, and we have
been strengthened by their divinely handed down teaching.  And thanks be
to God for his ineffable gift, that he hath not deserted us at the end
nor hath the rod of the ungodly come into the lot of the righteous, lest
the righteous put their hands, that is to say <span id="page_542">p.
542</span> <span id="xvi.viii-Page_542"></span>their actual deeds, <span
id="fr_528"></span>[529](#fn_528.md) unto wickedness.  But he doeth well
unto those who are good and true of heart, as the psalmist David
melodiously has sung; with whom also we sing the rest of the psalm:  As
for such as turn back unto their own wickedness, the Lord shall lead
them forth with the evil doers; and peace shall be upon the Israel of
God.
