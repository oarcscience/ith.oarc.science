<span id="viii.vii.iii.lxiv-p5"></span>Psalms of private origin, or
books uncanonical are not to be sung in temples; but the canonical
writings of the old and new testaments.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.lxiv-p7"></span>Several heretics, for instance
Bardesanes, Paul of Samosata, and Apollinaris—had composed psalms,
*i.e*., Church hymns.  The Synod of Laodicea forbade the use of any
composed by private individuals, namely all unauthorized Church hymns. 
Lüft remarks that by this it was not intended to forbid the use of all
but the Bible psalms and hymns, for it is known that even after this
Synod many hymns composed by individual Chris<span id="page_159">p.
159</span> <span id="viii.vii.iii.lxiv-Page_159"></span>tians, for
instance, Prudentius, Clement, Ambrose, came into use in the Church. 
Only those not sanctioned were to be banished.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.lxiv-p8"></span>This idea was greatly exaggerated
by some Gallicans in the seventeenth century who wished that all the
Antiphons, etc., should be in the words of Holy Scripture.  A learned
but somewhat distorted account of this whole matter will be found in the
*Institutions Liturgiques* by Dom Prosper Guéranger, tome ij., and a
shorter but more temperate account in Dr. Batiffol’s *Histoire du
Bréviaire Romain*, Chap. vj.
