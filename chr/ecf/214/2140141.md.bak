<span id="viii.vi.iv.iv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.vi.iv.iv-p2.1"></span>If</span> any bishop who has been deposed
by a synod, or any presbyter or deacon who has been deposed by his
bishop shall presume to execute any part of the ministry, whether it be
a bishop according to his former custom, or a presbyter, or a deacon, he
shall no longer have any prospect of restoration in another Synod; nor
any opportunity of making his defence; but they who communicate with him
shall all be cast out of the Church, and particularly if they have
presumed to communicate with the persons aforementioned, knowing the
sentence pronounced against them.

id="viii.vi.iv.iv-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon IV.</span>

<span id="viii.vi.iv.iv-p5"></span>If a bishop deposed by a synod shall
dare to celebrate the liturgy, let him have no chance of return.

<span id="viii.vi.iv.iv-p6"></span>This canon derives its chief interest
from the fact that it is usually considered to have been adopted at the
instigation of the party opposed to St. Athanasius and that afterwards
it was used against St. Chrysostom.  But while such may have been the
secret reason why some voted for it and others prized it, it must be
remembered that its provision is identical with that of the Apostolic
Canons, and that it was read at the Council of Chalcedon as Canon
eighty-three.  Remi Ceillier (*Histoire Genéral des Autheurs*, p. 659)
tries to prove that this is not the canon which St. Chrysostom and his
friends rejected, but Hefele thinks his position “altogether untenable”
(*Hist. of the Councils*, Vol. II., p. 62, n. 1), and refers to
Tillemont (*Mémoires*, p. 329, *Sur les Arians*, and Fuchs’ *Bib. der
Kirchenversammlungen*, P. II., p. 59. <span

<span id="viii.vi.iv.iv-p8"></span>Compare Apostolic Canon xxviij.

<span id="viii.vi.iv.iv-p9"></span>This canon is found twice in the
*Juris Corpus Canonici*, Gratian’s *Decretum*, Pars II., Causa XI.,
Quæst. III., Can. vj., and Can. vij. in the version of Martin
Bracarensis.  This version is very interesting as expanding the phrase
“to execute any part of the ministry” into “to make the oblation, or to
perform the morning or evening sacrifice as though he were in office
just as before, etc.”

<span id="viii.vi.iv.iv-p7"></span> Hefele on the preceding page (p. 61,
n. 1) says “Of course the sentence or canon to which the adversaries of
Chrysostom referred must be distinguished from the fourth and twelfth
true Antiochian canons.  It seems somewhat difficult to reconcile this
with what I have cited above, and with the following (p. 65):  “In the
affair of St. Chrysostom the canon employed against him was represented
as proceeding from the Arians, and all attempts to deny its identity
with our fourth and twelfth Antiochian canons are fruitless.”
