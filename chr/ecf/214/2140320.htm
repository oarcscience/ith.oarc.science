<p class="c18"><a name="xi.xviii.ii-p7"></A>A great scandal in the &#8220;Asian diocese&#8221; had led to St. Chrysostom&#146;s intervention.&#160; Antoninus, bishop of Ephesus, was charged, with &#8220;making it a rule to sell ordinations of bishops at rates proportionate to the value of their sees&#8221; (Palladius, <i>Dial. de vita Chrysost</i>., p. 50).&#160; Chrysostom held a synod at Ephesus, at which six bishops were deposed for having obtained their sees in this manner.&#160; Isidore of Pelasium repeatedly remonstrated with his bishop Eusebius on the heinousness of &#8220;selling the gift&#8221; of ordinations (<i>Epist</i>. I., 26, 30, 37); and names Zosimus, a priest, and Maron, a deacon, as thus ordained (<i>ib.</i> 111, 119).&#160; A few years before the council, a court of three bishops sat at Berytus to hear charges brought against Ibas, bishop of Edessa, by clerics of his diocese.&#160; The third charge was thus curtly worded:&#160; &#8220;Moreover he receives for laying on hands&#8221; (Mansi, vii. 224).&#160; The xxvijth Trullan canon repeated this canon of Chalcedon against persons ordained for money, doubtless in view of such a state of things as Gregory the Great had heard of nearly a century earlier, &#8220;that in the Eastern Churches no one comes to holy order except by the payment of premiums&#8221; (<i>Epist</i>. xi. 46, to the bishop of Jerusalem; compare Evagrius&#146;s assertion that Justin II. openly sold bishoprics, V. 1).&#160; It is easy to understand how the scruples of ecclesiastics could be abated by the courtly fashion of calling bribes &#8220;eulogi&aelig;&#8221; (Fleury, XXVI, 20), just as the six prelates above referred to had regarded their payments as an equivalent for that &#8220;making over of property to the Curia,&#8221; which was required by a law of 399 (Cod. Theod., xii. 1, 163, see notes in Transl. of Fleury, i. 163, ij. 16).</p> 
<p class="c19"><a name="xi.xviii.ii-p8"></A>The <span class="Greek"><a name="xi.xviii.ii-p8.1"></A>&#7956;&#954;&#948;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#962;</span>, &#8220;defensor,&#8221; was an official Advocate or counsel for the Church.&#160; The legal force of the term &#8220;defensor&#8221; is indicated by a law of Valentinian I. &#8220;Nec idem in eodem negotio defensor sit et qu&aelig;sitor&#8221; (Cod. Theod., ii. 10, 2).&#160; In the East the office was held by ecclesiastics; thus, John, presbyter and &#8220;advocate&#8221; was employed, at the Council of Constantinople in 448, to summon Eutyches (Mansi, vii. 697).&#160; About 496, Paul the &#8220;Advocate&#8221; of Constantinople saved his archbishop from the sword of a murderer at the cost of his own life (Theodor., Lect. ii. 11).&#160; In the list of the functionaries of St. Sophia, given by Goar in his Euchologion (p. 270), the Protecdicos is discribed as adjudicating, with twelve assessors, in smaller causes, on <A NAME="page_269"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 269</FONT></A> <a name="xi.xviii.ii-Page_269"></A>which he afterwards reports to the bishop.&#160; In Africa, on the other hand, from <span class="sc"><a name="xi.xviii.ii-p8.2"></A>a.d.</span> 407 (see Cod. Theod., xvi. 2, 38), the office was held by barristers, in accordance with a request of the African bishops (Cod. Afric., 97; Mansi, iii., 802), who, six years earlier, had asked for &#8220;defensores,&#8221; with special reference to the oppression of the poor by the rich (Cod. Afric., 75; Mansi, iii. 778, 970).&#160; The &#8220;defensores&#8221; mentioned by Gregory the Great had primarily to take care of the poor (<i>Epist</i>., v. 29), and of the church property (<i>ib</i>., i. 36), but also to be advocates of injured clerics (<i>ib.</i>, ix. 64) and act as assessors (<i>ib.</i>, x. 1), etc.</p> 
<p class="c19"><a name="xi.xviii.ii-p9"></A>The next office is that of the Prosmonarius or, according to a various reading adopted by many (<i>e.g.</i> Justellus, Hervetus, Beveridge, Bingham), the Paramonarius.&#160; Opinions differ as to the functions intended.&#160; Isidore gives simply &#8220;paramonarius:&#8221;&#160; Dionysius (see Justellus, <i>Biblioth</i>., i., 134) omits the word; but in the &#8220;interpretatio Dionysii,&#8221; as given in the Concilia, freedom has been taken to insert &#8220;vel mansionarium&#8221; in a parenthesis (vii. 373; see Beveridge, <i>in loc</i>.).&#160; Mansionarius is a literal rendering; but what was the function of a mansionarius?&#160; In Gregory the Great&#146;s time he was a sacristan who had the duty of lighting the church (<i>Dial.</i>, i. 5); and &#8220;ostiarium&#8221; in the <i>Prisca</i> implies the same idea.&#160; Tillemont, without deciding between the two Greek readings, thinks that the person intended had &#8220;some charge of what pertained to the church itself, perhaps like our present bedells&#8221; (xv. 694).&#160; So Fleury renders, &#8220;conci&egrave;rge&#8221; (xxviij. 29); and Newman, reading &#8220;paramonarion,&#8221; takes a like view (note in Transl. of Fleury, vol. iii., p. 392).&#160; But Justellus (i. 91) derives &#8220;paramonarius&#8221; from <span class="Greek"><a name="xi.xviii.ii-p9.1"></A>&#956;&#959;&#957;&#8053;</span> &#8220;mansio,&#8221; a halting-place, so that the sense would be a manager of one of the church&#146;s farms, a &#8220;villicus,&#8221; or, as Bingham expresses it, &#8220;a bailiff&#8221; (iii. 3, 1).&#160; Beveridge agrees with Justellus, except in giving to <span class="Greek"><a name="xi.xviii.ii-p9.2"></A>&#956;&#959;&#957;&#8053;</span> the sense of &#8220;monastery&#8221; (compare the use of <span class="Greek"><a name="xi.xviii.ii-p9.3"></A>&#956;&#959;&#957;&#8053;</span> in Athan., <i>Apol. c. Arian</i>, 67, where Valesius understands it as &#8220;a station&#8221; on a road, but others as &#8220;a monastery,&#8221; see Historical Writings of St. Athanasius, Introd., p. xliv.).&#160; Bingham also prefers this interpretation.&#160; Suicer takes it as required by &#8220;paramonarios&#8221; which he treats as the true reading:&#160; &#8220;prosmonarios&#8221; he thinks would have the sense of &#8220;sacristan.&#8221;</p> 
<p class="c36"><a name="xi.xviii.ii-p10"></A><span class="sc"><a name="xi.xviii.ii-p10.1"></A>Hefele.</span></p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="xi.xviii.ii-p11"></A>According to Van Espen, however, who here supports himself upon Du Cange, by &#8220;prosmonarios&#8221; or &#8220;mansionarius,&#8221; in the same way as by &#8220;oiconomos,&#8221; a steward of church property was to be understood.</p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="xi.xviii.ii-p12"></A>The canon is found in the <i>Corpus Juris Canonici</i>, Gratian&#146;s <i>Decretum</i>, Pars II., Causa I., Qu&aelig;st. i., can. viij.</p>
