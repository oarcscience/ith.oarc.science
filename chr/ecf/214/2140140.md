<span id="viii.vi.iv.iii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.vi.iv.iii-p2.1"></span>If</span> any presbyter or deacon, or
any one whatever belonging to the priesthood, shall forsake his own
parish, and shall depart, and, having wholly changed his residence,
shall set himself to remain for a long time in another parish, let him
no longer officiate; especially if his own bishop shall summon and urge
him to return to his own parish and he shall disobey.  And if he persist
in his disorder, let him be wholly deposed from his ministry, so that no
further room be left for his restoration.  And if another bishop shall
receive a man deposed for this cause, let him be punished by the Common
Synod as one who nullifies the ecclesiastical laws.

id="viii.vi.iv.iii-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon III.</span>

<span id="viii.vi.iv.iii-p5"></span>*If any cleric leaves his own parish
and goes off to another, travelling here and there, and stays for a long
time in that other, let him not offer the sacrifice (<span
class="Greek"><span id="viii.vi.iv.iii-p5.1"></span>λειτουργείτω</span>
), especially if he do not return when called by his own bishop.  But if
he perseveres in his insolence let him be deposed, neither afterwards
let him have any power to return.  And if any bishop shall receive him
thus deposed, he shall be punished by the Common Synod for breach of the
ecclesiastical laws.*

<span id="viii.vi.iv.iii-p6"></span>Compare with Canons of the Apostles
xv. and xvi.

<span id="viii.vi.iv.iii-p7"></span>This canon is found in the *Corpus
Juris Canonici*, Gratian’s *Decretum*, Pars II., Causa VII., Quæst. I.,
Can. xxiv. <span id="fr_169"></span>[170](#fn_169.md)

<span id="viii.vi.iv.iii-p8"></span> Hefele seems to have overlooked
this.  The note referring to the Apostolic Canons is all wrong (p. 68,
n. 1.)
