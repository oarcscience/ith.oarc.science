<span id="viii.vii.iii.xl-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="viii.vii.iii.xl-p1.1"></span>Canon XXXV.</span>

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xl-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.vii.iii.xl-p2.1"></span>Christians</span> must not forsake the
Church of God, and go away and invoke angels and gather assemblies,
which things are forbidden.  If, therefore, any one shall be found
engaged in this covert idolatry, let him be anathema; for he has
forsaken our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, and has gone over to
idolatry.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xl-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.vii.iii.xl-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XXXV.</span>

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xl-p5"></span>Whoso calls assemblies in
opposition to those of the Church and names angels, is near to idolatry
and let him be anathema.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xl-p7"></span>Whatever the worship of angels
condemned by this canon may have been, one thing is manifest, that it
was a species of idolatry, and detracted from the worship due to Christ.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xl-p8"></span>Theodoret makes mention of this
superstitious cult in his exposition of the Text of St. Paul, [Col. ii.
18](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#018.md)<span
id="viii.vii.iii.xl-p8.1"></span>, and when writing of its condemnation
by this synod he says, “they were leading to worship angels such as were
defending the Law; for, said they, the Law was given through angels. 
And this vice lasted for a long time in Phrygia and Pisidia.  Therefore
it was that the synod which met at Laodicea in Phrygia, prohibited by a
canon, that prayer should be offered to angels, and even to-day an
oratory of St. Michael can be seen among them, and their neighbours.”

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xl-p9"></span>In the Capitular of Charlemagne,
<span class="sc"><span id="viii.vii.iii.xl-p9.1"></span>a.d.</span> 789
(cap. xvi.), it is said, “In that same council (Laodicea) it was ordered
that angels should not be given unknown names, and that such should not
be affixed to them, but that only they should be named by the names
which we have by authority.  These are Michael, Gabriel, Raphael.”  And
then is subjoined the present canon.  The canon forbids “to name” (<span
class="Greek"><span id="viii.vii.iii.xl-p9.2"></span>ὀνομάζειν</span>)
angels, and this was understood as meaning to give them names instead of
to call upon them by name.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xl-p10"></span>Perchance the authors of the
Capitular had in mind the Roman Council under Pope Zachary, <span
class="sc"><span id="viii.vii.iii.xl-p10.1"></span>a.d.</span> 745,
against Aldebert, who was found to invoke by name eight angels in his
prayers.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xl-p11"></span>It should be noted that some Latin
versions of great authority and antiquity read *angulos* for *angelos*. 
This would refer to doing these idolatrous rites in corners, hiddenly,
secretly, *occulte* as in the Latin.  But this reading, though so
respectable in the Latin, has no Greek authority for it.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xl-p12"></span><span id="page_151">p. 151</span>
<span id="viii.vii.iii.xl-Page_151"></span>This canon has often been
used in controversy as condemning the cultus which the Catholic Church
has always given to the angels, but those who would make such a use of
this canon should explain how these interpretations can be consistent
with the cultus of the Martyrs so evidently approved by the same
council; and how this canon came to be accepted by the Fathers of the
Second Council of Nice, if it condemned the then universal practice of
the Church, East and West.  *Cf*. Forbes, *Considerationes Modestæ*.
