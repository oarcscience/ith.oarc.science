<span id="viii.vii.iii.xxv-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.vii.iii.xxv-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XXII.</span>

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xxv-p5"></span>A subdeacon must not wear an
orarium nor leave the doors.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xxv-p6"></span>The “orarium” is what we call now
the stole.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xxv-p7"></span>In old times, so we are told by
Zonaras <span id="page_141">p. 141</span> <span
id="viii.vii.iii.xxv-Page_141"></span>and Balsamon, it was the place of
the subdeacons to stand at the church doors and to bring in and take out
the catechumens and the penitents at the proper points in the service. 
Zonaras remarks that no one need be surprised if this, like many other
ancient customs, has been entirely changed and abandoned.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xxv-p8"></span>This canon is found in the *Corpus
Juris Canonici*, Gratian’s *Decretum*, Pars I., Dist. xxxii., canon
xxvij., but reads *hostias* instead of *ostia*, thus making the canon
forbid the subdeacons to leave the Hosts; and to make this worse the
ancient Glossator adds, “but the subdeacon should remain and consume
them with the other ministers.”  The Roman Correctors indeed note the
error but have not felt themselves at liberty to correct it on account
of the authority of the gloss.  Van Espen remarks “To-day if any Hosts
remain which are not to be reserved, the celebrant consumes them
himself, but perchance in the time the gloss was written, it was the
custom that the subdeacons and other ministers of the altar were
accustomed to do this, but whenever the ministers present gradually fell
into the habit of not receiving the sacrament, this consumption of what
remained devolved upon the celebrant.” <span

the ancient custom is in full use in the Anglican Church today, ordered
expressly by the rubrics of the Prayer Book.
