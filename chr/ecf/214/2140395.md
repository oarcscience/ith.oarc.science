id="xiv.iii.xii-p1.1"></span>Canon XI.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.xii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.xii-p2.1"></span>Let</span> no one in the priestly order nor
any layman eat the unleavened bread of the Jews, nor have any familiar
intercourse with them, nor summon them in illness, nor receive medicines
from them, nor bathe with them; but if anyone shall take in hand to do
so, if he is a cleric, let him be deposed, but if a layman let him be
cut off.

<span id="xiv.iii.xii-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.xii-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XI.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.xii-p5"></span>Jewish unleavened bread is to be
refused.  Whoever even calls in Jews as physicians or bathes with them
is to be deposed.

<span id="xiv.iii.xii-p6"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.xii-p6.1"></span>Van Espen.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.xii-p7"></span>Theodore Balsamon is of opinion that
this canon does not forbid the eating of unleavened bread; but that what
is intended is the keeping of feasts in a Jewish fashion, or in
sacrifices to use unleavened bread (*azymes*), and this, says Balsamon,
on account of the Latins who celebrate their feasts with azymes.

<span id="xiv.iii.xii-p8"></span>Canon lxix. \[i.e., lxx.\] of those
commonly called Apostolic forbids the observance of festivals with the
Jews; and declares it to be unlawful to receive manuscula from them, but
by this canon all familiar intercourse with them is forbidden.

<span id="xiv.iii.xii-p9"></span>While there can be no doubt that in all
the Trullan canons there is an undercurrent of hostility to the West,
yet in this canon I can see no such spirit, and I think it has been read
into it by the greater bitterness of later times.  This seems the more
certain from the fact that there is nothing new whatever in the
provision with respect to the passover bread, *vide* canons of Laodicea
xxxvij. and xxxviij.

<span id="xiv.iii.xii-p10"></span>This canon is found in the *Corpus
Juris Canonici*, Gratian’s *Decretum*, Pars II., Causa xxviij., can.
xiii. <span id="fr_358"></span>[359](#fn_358)

<span id="xiv.iii.xii-p11"></span> Van Espen says that in his copy of
Gratian this canon is assigned to the VIIth Synod.  Such is not the case
in the edition in Migne’s *Patrologia Latina*, where the reference is
given as *ex VI.* *Synodo. c. II.,* and *Judæorum* is found in the text
instead of the *eorum* of which Van Espen complains.
