<span id="viii.vii.iii.xxiii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.vii.iii.xxiii-p2.1"></span>It</span> is not right for a deacon
to sit in the presence of a presbyter, unless he be bidden by the
presbyter to sit down.  Likewise the deacons shall have worship of the
subdeacons and all the \[inferior\] clergy.

id="viii.vii.iii.xxiii-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XX.</span>

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xxiii-p5"></span>A deacon shall not sit down
unless bidden.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xxiii-p6"></span>This is another canon to curb
the ambition of Levites who wish to take upon themselves the honours of
the priesthood also.  Spiritual Cores seem to have been common in early
times among the deacons and this is but one of many canons on the
subject.  Compare Canon XVIII of the Council of Nice.  Van Espen points
out that in the Apostolic Constitutions (Lib. II., cap. lvij), occurs
the following passage, “Let the seat for the bishop be set in the midst,
and on each side of him let the presbyters sit, and let the deacons
stand, having their loins girded.”

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xxiii-p8"></span>Here it should be noted, by the
way, that in this canon there is presented a hierarchy consisting of
bishops, presbyters, and deacons and other inferior ministers, each with
their mutual subordination one to the other.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xxiii-p9"></span>This canon is found in the
*Corpus Juris Canonici*, Gratian’s *Decretum*, Pars I., Dist. xciii., c.
xv., in Dionysius’s version.
