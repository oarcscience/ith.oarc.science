id="xi.xviii.xxvii-p1.1"></span>Canon XXVII.</span>

<span id="xi.xviii.xxvii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xi.xviii.xxvii-p2.1"></span>The</span> holy Synod has decreed that
those who forcibly carry off women under pretence of marriage, and the
aiders or abettors of such ravishers, shall be degraded if clergymen,
and if laymen be anathematized.

<span id="xi.xviii.xxvii-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xi.xviii.xxvii-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XXVII.</span>

<span id="xi.xviii.xxvii-p5"></span>If a clergyman elope with a woman,
let him be expelled from the Church.  If a layman, let him be anathema. 
The same shall be the lot of any that assist him.

<span id="xi.xviii.xxvii-p6"></span>This canon is found in the *Corpus
Juris Canonici*, Gratian’s *Decretum*, Pars II., Causa XXXVI., Q. II.,
canon j.

<span id="xi.xviii.xxvii-p7"></span>In many old collections this is the
last canon of this Council, *e.g.*, Dionysius Exiguus, Isidore, the
*Prisca*, the Greek by John of Antioch, and the Arabic by Joseph
Ægyptius.  The reader familiar with the subject will have but little
difficulty in explaining to his own satisfaction the omission of canon
xxviij. in these instances.
