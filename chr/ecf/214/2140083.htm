<p class="c18"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xxii-p6"></A>The phrase &#8220;and to this some have assented&#8221; is the translation of Hervetus, Van Espen, and Hefele.&#160; Dr. Routh suggests to understand <span class="Greek"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xxii-p6.1"></A>&#7937;&#953;</span> and translate, &#8220;the same punishment will be inflicted on those who assist in causing miscarriages,&#8221; but this seems rather an unnatural and strained rendering of the Greek.</p>
