<p class="c35"><a name="viii.vii.iii.xxxvi-p5"></A>It is not right to give children in marriage to heretics, but they should be received if they promise to become Christians.</p>

<p class="c18"><a name="viii.vii.iii.xxxvi-p7"></A>By this canon the faithful are forbidden to contract marriage with heretics or to join their children in such; for, as both Balsamon and Zonaras remark, &#8220;they imbue them with their errors, and lead them to embrace their own perverse opinions.&#8221;</p>
