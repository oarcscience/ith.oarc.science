id="viii.vii.iii.xxxiv-p1.1"></span>Canon XXIX.</span>

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xxxiv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.vii.iii.xxxiv-p2.1"></span>Christians</span> must not judaize
by resting on the Sabbath, but must work on that day, rather honouring
the Lord’s Day; and, if they can, resting then as Christians.  But if
any shall be found to be judaizers, let them be anathema from Christ.

id="viii.vii.iii.xxxiv-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon
XXIX.</span>

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xxxiv-p5"></span>A Christian shall not stop work
on the Sabbath, but on the Lord’s Day.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xxxiv-p6"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.vii.iii.xxxiv-p6.1"></span>Balsamon.</span>

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xxxiv-p7"></span>Here the Fathers order that no
one of the faithful shall stop work on the Sabbath as do <span
id="page_149">p. 149</span> <span
id="viii.vii.iii.xxxiv-Page_149"></span>the Jews, but that they should
honour the Lord’s Day, on account of the Lord’s resurrection, and that
on that day they should abstain from manual labour and go to church. 
But thus abstaining from work on Sunday they do not lay down as a
necessity, but they add, “if they can.”  For if through need or any
other necessity any one worked on the Lord’s day this was not reckoned
against him.
