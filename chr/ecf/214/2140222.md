id="viii.vii.iii.lvi-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon LI.</span>

<span id="viii.vii.iii.lvi-p5"></span>Commemorations of Martyrs shall
only be held on Lord’s days and Sabbaths.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.lvi-p6"></span>By this canon all Saints-days are
forbidden to be observed in Lent on the days on which they fall, but
must be transferred to a Sabbath or else to the Sunday, when they can be
kept with the festival service of the full liturgy and not with the
penitential incompleteness of the Mass of the Presanctified.  Compare
canon xlix. of this Synod, and canon lij. of the Quinisext Council.

id="viii.vii.iii.lvi-p7.1"></span>Balsamon.</span>

<span id="viii.vii.iii.lvi-p8"></span>The whole of Lent is a time of
grief for our sins, and the memories of the Saints are not kept except
on the Sabbaths.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.lvi-p9"></span>Van Espen remarks how in old
calendars there are but few Saints-days in those months in which Lent
ordinarily falls, and that the multitude of days now kept by the Roman
*ordo* are mostly of modern introduction.
