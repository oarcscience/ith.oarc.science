<span id="xii.xi-p4"></span>At last the Pope Vigilius resigned himself
to the advice of the Council, and six months afterwards wrote a letter
to the Patriarch Eutychius, wherein he confesses that he has been
wanting in charity in dividing from his brethren.  He adds, that one
ought not to be ashamed to retract, when one recognises the truth, and
brings forward the example of Augustine.  He says, that, after having
better examined the matter of the Three Chapters, he finds them worthy
of condemnation.  “We recognize for our brethren and colleagues all
those who have condemned them, and annul by this writing all that has
been done by us or by others for the defence of the three chapters.”
