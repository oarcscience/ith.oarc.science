<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxx-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.cxx-p1.1"></span>Canon CXIX.  (Greek cxx.)</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxx-p2"></span>That if a bishop shall possess a
diocese which he has snatched from heresy for three years, no one may
take it from him.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxx-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.cxx-p3.1"></span>Item</span>, it seemed good that if anyone
after the laws should convert any place to Catholic unity and retain it
for three years without opposition, it should not be taken away from him
afterwards.  If however there was during those three years a bishop who
could claim it and was silent, he shall lose the opportunity.  But if
there was no bishop, no prejudice shall happen to the see, <span
id="fr_481"></span>[482](#fn_481) but it shall be lawful when the place
that had none shall receive a bishop, to make the claim within three
years of that day.  Item, if a Donatist bishop shall be converted to the
Catholic party, the time that has elapsed shall not count against him,
but from the day of his conversion for three years he shall have the
right of making a claim on the places which belonged to his See.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxx-p7"></span>*Whosoever shall convert a region to
Orthodoxy and shall keep it converted for three years, let him be
without blame.  But if the bishop converted from Donatus within three
years of its conversion seeks his diocese again, let it be returned to
him* (<span class="Greek"><span id="xv.iv.iv.cxx-p7.1"></span>εἰ
