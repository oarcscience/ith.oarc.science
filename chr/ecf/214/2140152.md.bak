<span id="viii.vi.iv.xv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.vi.iv.xv-p2.1"></span>If</span> any bishop, lying under any
accusation, shall be judged by all the bishops in the province, and all
shall unanimously deliver the same verdict concerning him, he shall not
be again judged by others, but the unanimous sentence of the bishops of
the province shall stand firm.

<span id="viii.vi.iv.xv-p5"></span>If all the bishops of a province
agree with regard to a bishop already sentenced, a new trial shall not
be granted him.

id="viii.vi.iv.xv-p6.1"></span>Van Espen.</span>

<span id="viii.vi.iv.xv-p7"></span>By the phrase “by others” must be
understood bishops called from a neighbouring province, of which mention
is made in the previous canon, where in the case of an agreement among
the bishops, the synod did not wish to be called in, even if it were
demanded by the condemned bishop.  This canon, therefore, is a
supplement as it were to the preceding.  And for this reason in the
*Breviarium* and in Cresconius’s *Collection* of Canons they are placed
under a common title, cap. 144, “Concerning the difference of opinion
which happens in the judgment of bishops, or when a bishop is cut off by
all the bishops of his province.”

<span id="viii.vi.iv.xv-p8"></span>From these canons it is manifest that
at first the causes of bishops were agitated and decided in provincial
synods, and this discipline continued for many centuries, and was little
by little departed from in the <span class="sc"><span
id="viii.vi.iv.xv-p8.1"></span>VIII</span>th and <span class="sc"><span
id="viii.vi.iv.xv-p8.2"></span>IX</span>th centuries.

<span id="viii.vi.iv.xv-p9"></span>This canon is found in the *Corpus
Juris Canonici*, Gratian’s *Decretum*, Pars II., Causa VI., Quæst. IV.,
Can. v.  Gratian adds a note which Van Espen remarks smacks of his own
date rather than of that of the Synod of Antioch.
