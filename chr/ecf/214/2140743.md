<span id="xvii.xxiii-p4"></span>We should know that not every book which
is called Scripture is to be received as a safe guide.  For some are
tolerably sound and others are more than doubtful.  Therefore the books
which the inspiration of God hath given I will enumerate.  \[Then
follows a list of the proto-canonical books of the Old Testament, Esther
alone being omitted.  All the deutero-canonical books are omitted.  He
then continues\] to these some add Esther.  I must now show what are the
books of the New Testament.  \[Then follow all the books of the New
Testament except the Revelation.  He continues,\] But some add to these
the Revelation of John, but by far the majority say that it is
spurious.  This is the most true canon of the divinely given Scriptures.

<span id="xvii.xxiii-p6"></span>We have thus four \[five if we accept
the Laodicean list as genuine,\] different canons of Holy Scripture, all
having the approval of the Council in Trullo and of the Seventh
Ecumenical.  From this there seems but one conclusion possible, viz.: 
that the approval given was not specific but general.

<span id="xvii.xxiii-p3"></span> That is the canon of Holy Scripture.  I
have substituted my own Epitome, in the room of Johnson’s, translating
the original as it is found in Beveridge’s *Synodicon*, Tom. II., p.
179.  It is also in Aristenus’s *Epitome*.  Balsamon has no scholion on
this passage.
