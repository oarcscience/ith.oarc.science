<span id="viii.v.iv.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="viii.v.iv.xiv-p1.1"></span>Canon XIV.</span>

<span id="viii.v.iv.xiv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.v.iv.xiv-p2.1"></span>If</span> any woman shall forsake her
husband, and resolve to depart from him because she abhors marriage, let
her be anathema.

<span id="viii.v.iv.xiv-p3"></span><span class="c4"><span

<span id="viii.v.iv.xiv-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.v.iv.xiv-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XIV.</span>

<span id="viii.v.iv.xiv-p5"></span>Women who keep away from their
husbands because they abominate marriage, anathema to them.

<span id="viii.v.iv.xiv-p6"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.v.iv.xiv-p6.1"></span>Hefele.</span>

<span id="viii.v.iv.xiv-p7"></span>This canon cannot in any way be
employed in opposition to the practice of the Catholic Church.  For
though the Church allows one of a married couple, with the consent of
the other, to give up matrimonial intercourse, and to enter the clerical
order or the cloister, still this is not, as is the case with the
Eustathians, the result of a false dogmatic theory, but takes place with
a full recognition of the sanctity of marriage.

<span id="viii.v.iv.xiv-p8"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.v.iv.xiv-p8.1"></span>Van Espen.</span>

<span id="viii.v.iv.xiv-p9"></span>It would seem that the Eustathians
chiefly disapproved of the use of marriage, and under pretext of
preserving continence induced married women to abstain from its use as
from something unlawful, and to leave their husbands, separating from
them so far as the bed was concerned; and so the Greek interpreters
understand this canon; for the Eustathians were never accused of
persuading anyone to dissolve a marriage *a vinculo*.

<span id="viii.v.iv.xiv-p10"></span>This canon is found in the *Corpus
Juris Canonici*, Gratian’s *Decretum*, Pars I., Dist, xxx., c. iii., but
in Isidore’s version, which misses the sense by implying that a divorce
*a vinculo* is intended.  The Roman Correctors do not note this error.
