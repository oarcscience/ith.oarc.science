id="xv.iv.iv.lxxxi-p1.1"></span>Canon LXXX.  (Greek lxxxiii.)</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxxxi-p2"></span>That it is not permitted to make
superiors of monasteries nor to ordain as clerics those who are received
from a monastery not one’s own.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxxxi-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.lxxxi-p3.1"></span>Item</span>, it seemed good that if any
bishop wished to advance to the clericature a monk received from a
monastery not under his jurisdiction, or shall have appointed him
superior of a monastery of his own, the bishop who shall have thus acted
shall be separated from the communion of others and shall rest content
with the communion of his own people alone, but the monk shall continue
neither as cleric nor superior.
