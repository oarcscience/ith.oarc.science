<span id="vii.vi.xxx-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="vii.vi.xxx-p2.1"></span>Forasmuch</span> as there are certain
persons who kneel on the Lord’s Day and in the days of Pentecost,
therefore, to the intent that all things may be uniformly observed
everywhere (in every parish), it seems good to the holy Synod that
prayer be made to God standing.

<span id="vii.vi.xxx-p5"></span>On Lord’s days and at Pentecost all must
pray standing and not kneeling.

<span id="vii.vi.xxx-p7"></span>Although kneeling was the common posture
for prayer in the primitive Church, yet the custom had prevailed, even
from the earliest times, of standing at prayer on the Lord’s day, and
during the fifty days between Easter and Pentecost.  Tertullian, in a
passage in his treatise *De Corona Militis*, which is often quoted,
mentions it amongst other observances which, though not expressly
commanded in Scripture, yet were universally practised upon the
authority of tradition.  “We consider it unlawful,” he says, “to fast,
or to pray kneeling, upon the Lord’s day; we enjoy the same liberty from
Easter-day to that of Pentecost.”  *De Cor. Mil*. s. 3, 4.  Many other
of the Fathers notice the same practice, the reason of which, as given
by Augustine and others, was to commemorate the resurrection of our
Lord, and to signify the rest and joy of our own resurrection, which
that of our Lord assured.  This canon, as Beveridge observes, is a proof
of the importance formerly attached to an uniformity of sacred rites
throughout the Church, which made the Nicene Fathers thus sanction and
enforce by their authority a practice which in itself is indifferent,
and not commanded directly or indirectly in Scripture, and assign this
as their reason for doing so:  “In order that all things may be observed
in like manner in every parish” or diocese.

<span id="vii.vi.xxx-p9"></span>All the churches did not, however, adopt
this practice; for we see in the Acts of the Apostles ([Acts
20:36](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#036), [Acts
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#005)<span
id="vii.vi.xxx-p9.1"></span>) that St. Paul prayed kneeling during the
time between Pentecost and Easter.

<span id="vii.vi.xxx-p10"></span>This canon is found in the *Corpus
Juris Canonici*.  *Decretum*, Pars III, *De Conc*. Dist. III. c. x.
