id="x.xvi.iv-p2.1"></span>If</span> any provincial bishops were not
present at the holy Synod and have joined or attempted to join the
apostacy; or if, after subscribing the deposition of Nestorius, they
went back into the assembly of apostates; these men, according to the
decree of the holy Synod, are to be deposed from the priesthood and
degraded from their rank.

<span id="x.xvi.iv-p5"></span>If any bishop assents to or favours
Nestorius, let him be discharged.

<span id="x.xvi.iv-p6"></span>It was not unnatural that when it was seen
that the Imperial authority was in favour of the Antiochene party that
some of the clergy should have been weak enough to vacillate in their
course, the more so as the Conciliabulum was not either avowedly, nor
really, a Nestorian assembly, but one made up of those not sympathizing
with Nestorius’s heresy, yet friendly to the heretic himself, and
disapproving of what they looked upon as the uncalled-for harshness and
precipitancy of Cyril’s course.
