<span id="viii.iii.iii.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.iii-p1.1"></span>Canon III.</span>

<span id="viii.iii.iii.iii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.iii-p2.1"></span>Those</span> who have fled and been
apprehended, or have been betrayed by their servants; or those who have
been otherwise despoiled of their goods, or have endured tortures, or
have been imprisoned and abused, declaring themselves to be Christians;
or who have been forced to receive something which their persecutors
violently thrust into their hands, or meat \[offered to idols\],
continually professing that they were Christians; and who, by their
whole apparel, and demeanour, and humility of life, always give evidence
of grief at what has happened; these persons, inasmuch as they are free
from sin, are not to be repelled from the communion; and if, through an
extreme strictness or ignorance of some things, they have been repelled,
let them forthwith be re-admitted.  This shall hold good alike of clergy
and laity.  It has also been considered whether laymen who have fallen
under the same compulsion may be admitted to orders, and we have decreed
that, since they have in no respect been guilty, they may be ordained;
provided their past course of life be found to have been upright.

<span id="viii.iii.iii.iii-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.iii-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon III.</span>

<span id="viii.iii.iii.iii-p5"></span>Those who have been subjected to
torments and have suffered violence, and have eaten food offered to
idols after being tyrannized over, shall not be deprived of communion. 
And laymen who have endured the same sufferings, since they have in no
way transgressed, if they wish to be ordained, they may be, if otherwise
they be blameless.

<span id="viii.iii.iii.iii-p6"></span>In the translation the word
“abused” is given as the equivalent of <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.iii-p6.1"></span>περισχισθέντας</span> , which Zonaras
translated, “if their clothes have been torn from their bodies,” and
this is quite accurate if the reading is correct, but Routh has found in
the Bodleian several <span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.iii-p6.2"></span>mss.</span> which had <span
class="Greek"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.iii-p6.3"></span>περισχεθέντας</span>.  Hefele adopts
this reading and translates “declaring themselves to be Christians but
who have subsequently been vanquished, whether their oppressors have by
force put incense into their hands or have compelled them, etc.” 
Hammond translates “and have been harassed by their persecutors forcibly
putting something into their hands or who have been compelled, etc.” 
The phrase is obscure at best with either reading.

<span id="viii.iii.iii.iii-p7"></span>This canon is in the *Corpus Juris
Canonici* united to the two previous canons, *Decretum*, Pars I., Dist.
l., c. xxxii.
