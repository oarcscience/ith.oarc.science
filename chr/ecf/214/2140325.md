<span id="xi.xviii.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xi.xviii.vii-p1.1"></span>Canon VII.</span>

<span id="xi.xviii.vii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xi.xviii.vii-p2.1"></span>We</span> have decreed that those who have
once been enrolled among the clergy, or have been made monks, shall
accept neither a military charge nor any secular dignity; and if they
shall presume to do so and not repent in such wise as to turn again to
that which they had first chosen for the love of God, they shall be
anathematized.

<span id="xi.xviii.vii-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xi.xviii.vii-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon VII.</span>

<span id="xi.xviii.vii-p5"></span>If any cleric or monk arrogantly
affects the military or any other dignity, let him be cursed.

<span id="xi.xviii.vii-p6"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xi.xviii.vii-p6.1"></span>Hefele.</span>

<span id="xi.xviii.vii-p7"></span>Something similar was ordered by the
lxxxiii. (lxxxii.) Apostolic Canon, only that it threatens the cleric
who takes military service merely with deposition from his clerical
office, while our canon subjects him to excommunication.…The Greek
commentators, Balsamon and Zonaras, think that our canon selects a more
severe punishment, that of excommunication, because it has in view those
clerics who have not merely taken military service, etc., but at the
same time have laid aside their clerical dress and put on secular
clothing.

<span id="xi.xviii.vii-p9"></span>By <span class="Greek"><span
id="xi.xviii.vii-p9.1"></span>στρατείαν</span> \[which I have translated
(or, as Canon Bright thinks, mistranslated) “military charge”\],
“militiam,” is here meant, not military employment as such, but the
public service in general.  This use of the term is a relic and token of
the military basis of the Roman monarchy.  The court of the Imperator
was called his camp, <span class="Greek"><span
id="xi.xviii.vii-p9.2"></span>στρατόπεδον</span> (Cod. Theod., tom. ii.,
p. 22), as in Constantine’s letter’s to John Archaph and the Council of
Tyre (Athan., *Apol. c. Ari*., lxx. 86), and in the <span
class="sc"><span id="xi.xviii.vii-p9.3"></span>VII</span>th canon of
Sardica, so Athanasius speaks of the “camp” of Constans (*Apol. ad
Constant*, iv. ), and of that of Constantius at Milan (*Hist. Ari*.,
xxxvij.); so Hosius uses the same phrase in his letter to Constantius
(*ib.* xliv.); so the Semi-Arian bishops, when addressing Jovian <span
id="page_273">p. 273</span> <span
id="xi.xviii.vii-Page_273"></span>(Soz., vi. 4); so Chrysostom in the
reign of Theodosius I. (*Hom. ad Pop. Antioch*, vi. 2).  Similarly,
there were officers of the palace called Castrensians (Tertull., *De
Cor*., 12), as being “milites alius generis—de imperatoria familia”
(Gothofred, Cod. Theod., tom. ii., p. 526).  So <span
class="Greek"><span id="xi.xviii.vii-p9.4"></span>στρατεύσθαι</span> is
used for holding a place at court, as in Soc., iv. 9; Soz., vi. 9, on
Marcian’s case, and a very clear passage in Soc., v. 25, where the verb
is applied to an imperial secretary.  It occurs in combination with
<span class="Greek"><span id="xi.xviii.vii-p9.5"></span>στρατεία</span>
in a petition of an Alexandrian deacon named Theodore, which was read in
the third session of Chalcedon:  he says, “<span class="Greek"><span
id="xi.xviii.vii-p9.6"></span>᾽</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="xi.xviii.vii-p9.7"></span>Εστρατευσάμεν</span> for about twenty-two
years in the Schola of the magistrians” (under the Magister officionum,
or chief magistrate of the palace), “but I disregarded <span
class="Greek"><span id="xi.xviii.vii-p9.8"></span>στρατείας τοσούτον
χρόναυ</span> in order to enter the ministry” (Mansi, vi. 1008).  See
also Theodoret, *Relig. Hist*., xij., on the emperor’s letter-carriers. 
In the same sense Honorius, by a law of 408, forbids non-Catholics
“intra palatium militare” (Cod Theod., xvi., 5, 42); and the Vandal king
Hunneric speaks of “domus nostræ militiæ” (Victor Vitens, iv. 2).

<span id="xi.xviii.vii-p10"></span>This canon is found in the *Corpus
Juris Canonici*, Gratian’s *Decretum*, Pars II., Causa xx., Quæst. iii.,
Can. iij.
