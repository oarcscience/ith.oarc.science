id="xii.x-p1.1"></span>The Anathematisms of the Emperor Justinian
Against Origen. <span id="fr_318"></span>[319](#fn_318) </span>

<span id="xii.x-p3"></span>(Labbe and Cossart, *Concilia*, Tom. v., col.
677.)

<span id="xii.x-p4"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xii.x-p4.1"></span>I.</span>

<span id="xii.x-p5"></span>Whoever says or thinks that human souls
pre-existed, i.e., that they had previously been spirits and holy
powers, but that, satiated with the vision of God, they had turned to
evil, and in this way the divine love in them had died out (<span
class="Greek"><span id="xii.x-p5.1"></span>ἀπψυγείσας</span>) and they
had therefore become souls (<span class="Greek"><span
id="xii.x-p5.2"></span>ψυχάς</span>) and had been condemned to
punishment in bodies, shall be anathema.

<span id="xii.x-p6"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xii.x-p6.1"></span>II.</span>

<span id="xii.x-p7"></span>If anyone says or thinks that the soul of the
Lord pre-existed and was united with God the Word before the Incarnation
and Conception of the Virgin, let him be anathema.

<span id="xii.x-p8"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xii.x-p8.1"></span>III.</span>

<span id="xii.x-p9"></span>If anyone says or thinks that the body of our
Lord Jesus Christ was first formed in the womb of the holy Virgin and
that afterwards there was united with it God the Word and the
pre-existing soul, let him be anathema.

<span id="xii.x-p10"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xii.x-p10.1"></span>IV.</span>

<span id="xii.x-p11"></span>If anyone says or thinks that the Word of
God has become like to all heavenly orders, so that for the cherubim he
was a cherub, for the seraphim a seraph:  in short, like all the
superior powers, let him be anathema.

<span id="xii.x-p12"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xii.x-p12.1"></span>V.</span>

<span id="xii.x-p13"></span>If anyone says or thinks that, at the
resurrection, human bodies will rise spherical in form and unlike our
present form, let him be anathema.

<span id="xii.x-p14"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xii.x-p14.1"></span>VI.</span>

<span id="xii.x-p15"></span>If anyone says that the heaven, the sun, the
moon, the stars, and the waters that are above heavens, have souls, and
are reasonable beings, let him be anathema.

<span id="xii.x-p16"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xii.x-p16.1"></span>VII.</span>

<span id="xii.x-p17"></span>If anyone says or thinks that Christ the
Lord in a future time will be crucified for demons as he was for men,
let him be anathema.

<span id="xii.x-p18"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xii.x-p18.1"></span>VIII.</span>

<span id="xii.x-p19"></span>If anyone says or thinks that the power of
God is limited, and that he created as much as he was able to compass,
let him be anathema.

<span id="xii.x-p20"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xii.x-p20.1"></span>IX.</span>

<span id="xii.x-p21"></span>If anyone says or thinks that the punishment
of demons and of impious men is only temporary, and will one day have an
end, and that a restoration (<span class="Greek"><span
id="xii.x-p21.1"></span>ἀποκατάστασις</span>) will take place of demons
and of impious men, let him be anathema.

<span id="xii.x-p22"></span>Anathema to Origen and to that Adamantius,
who set forth these opinions together with his nefarious and execrable
and wicked doctrine <span id="fr_319"></span>[320](#fn_319) and to
whomsoever there is who thinks thus, or defends these opinions, or in
any way hereafter at any time shall presume to protect them.

id="xii.x-p1.2"></span>

<span id="xii.x-p2"></span> The reader should carefully study the entire
tractate of the Emperor against Origen of which these anathematisms are
the conclusion.  It is found in Labbe and Cossart, and in many other
collections.

<span id="fn_319"></span>[320:320](2140361.htm#fr_319) <span
id="xii.x-p22.1"></span>

<span id="xii.x-p23"></span> The text is, I think corrupt, at all events
the Latin and Greek do not agree.
