<p class="c18"><a name="xv.iii.iv.x-p3"></A><span class="sc"><a name="xv.iii.iv.x-p3.1"></A>Bishop</span> <span class="sc"><a name="xv.iii.iv.x-p3.2"></A>Hosius</span> said:&#160; This also I think necessary.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_392"></A><A HREF="#fn_392"><FONT SIZE="1">393</FONT></A>
&#160; Ye should consider with all thoroughness and care, that if some rich man or professional advocate be desired for bishop, he be not ordained until he have fulfilled the ministry of reader, deacon, and presbyter, in order that, passing by promotion through the several grades, he may <A NAME="page_425"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 425</FONT></A> <a name="xv.iii.iv.x-Page_425"></A>advance (if, that is, he be found worthy) to the height of the episcopate.&#160; And he shall remain in each order assuredly for no brief time, that so his faith, his reputable life, his steadfastness of character and considerateness of demeanour may be well-known, and that he, being deemed worthy of the divine sacerdotal office [<i>sacerdotium</i>, i.e., the episcopate] may enjoy the highest honour.&#160; For it is not fitting, nor does discipline or good conversation allow to proceed to this act rashly or lightly, so as to ordain a bishop or presbyter or deacon hastily; as thus he would rightly be accounted a novice, especially since also the most blessed Apostle, he who was the teacher of the Gentiles, is seen to have forbidden hasty ordinations; for the test of [even] the longest period will not unreasonably be required to exemplify the conversation and character of each [candidate].</p> 
<p class="c19"><a name="xv.iii.iv.x-p5"></A>All said that this was their pleasure and that it must be absolutely irreversible.</p>

<p class="c18"><a name="xv.iii.iv.x-p11"></A><i>No lawyer, teacher, or gentleman</i> (<span class="Greek"><a name="xv.iii.iv.x-p11.1"></A>&#960;&#955;&#959;&#8059;&#963;&#953;&#959;&#962;</span>) <i>shall be made a bishop without passing through the holy orders.&#160; Nor shall the space of time between the orders be made too brief, that there may be a better proof of his faith and good conversation.&#160; For otherwise he is a neophyte.</i></p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="xv.iii.iv.x-p12"></A>This is Canon XIII. of Dionysius, Isidore, and the <i>Prisca</i>.</p>

<p class="c18"><a name="xv.iii.iv.x-p14"></A>By <i>Scholasticus de foro</i> [&#8220;professional advocate&#8221;] must be understood an eloquent pleader of difficult causes, who being bound up in forensic disputes and strifes, may be presumed to be little fitted for the priesthood, and therefore to need a more strict examination.</p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="xv.iii.iv.x-p15"></A>The Synodal approbation is lacking in Dionysius as given by Justellus, as well as in that of the Roman Code, but is found in Labbe&#146;s reprint of Dionysius and Isidore.</p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="xv.iii.iv.x-p16"></A>This Canon is found in the <i>Corpus Juris Canonici</i>, Gratian&#146;s <i>Decretum</i>, P. I., Dist. lxj., c. x.</p>
