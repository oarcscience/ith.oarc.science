id="xiv.iii.lxi-p1.1"></span>Canon LX.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.lxi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.lxi-p2.1"></span>Since</span> the Apostle exclaims that he
who cleaves to the Lord is one spirit, it is clear that he who is
intimate with his \[i.e. the Lord’s\] enemy becomes one by his affinity
with him.  Therefore, those who pretend they are possessed by a devil
and by their depravity of manners feign to manifest their form and
appearance; it seems good by all means that they should be punished and
that they should be subjected to afflictions and hardships of the same
kind as those to which they who are truly demoniacally possessed are
justly subjected with the intent of delivering them from the \[work or
rather\] energy of the devil.

id="xiv.iii.lxi-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon LX.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.lxi-p5"></span>Whoever shall pretend to be possessed
by a devil, shall endure the penance of demoniacs.

<span id="xiv.iii.lxi-p6"></span>Zonaras says in his scholion that even
in his day people made the same claim to diabolical possession.
