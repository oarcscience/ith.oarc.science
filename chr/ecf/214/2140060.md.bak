<span id="viii.iii.ii-p2"></span>Soon after the death of the Emperor
Maximin, <span id="fr_115"></span>[116](#fn_115.md) a council was held at
Ancyra, the capital of Galatia.  Only about a dozen bishops were
present, and the lists of subscriptions which are found appended to the
canons are not to be depended on, being evidently in their present form
of later authorship; as has been shewn by the Ballerini.  If we may at
all trust the lists, it would seem that nearly every part of Syria and
Asia Minor was represented, and that therefore the council while small
in numbers was of considerable weight.  It is not certain whether
Vitalis, (bishop of Antioch,) presided or Marcellus, who was at the time
bishop of Ancyra.  The honour is by the Libellus Synodicus assigned to
the latter.

<span id="viii.iii.ii-p4"></span>The disciplinary decrees of this
council possess a singular interest as being the first enacted after the
ceasing of the persecution of the Christians and as providing for the
proper treatment of the lapsed.  Recently two papyri have been
recovered, containing the official certificates granted by the Roman
government to those who had lapsed and offered sacrifice.  These
apostates were obliged to acknowledge in public their adhesion to the
national religion of the empire, and then were provided with a document
certifying to this fact to keep them from further trouble.  Dr. Harnack
(*Preussische Jahrbücher*) writing of the yielding of the lapsed says:

<span id="viii.iii.ii-p5"></span>“The Church condemned this as lying and
denial of the faith, and after the termination of the persecution, these
unhappy people were partly excommunicated, partly obliged to submit to
severe discipline.  Who would ever suppose that the records of their
shame would come doom to our time?—and yet it has actually happened. 
Two of these papers have been preserved, contrary to all likelihood, by
the sands of Egypt which so carefully keep what has been entrusted to
them.  The first was found by Krebs in a heap of papyrus, that had come
to Berlin; the other was found by Wessely in the papyrus collection of
Archduke Rainer.  ‘I, Diogenes, have constantly sacrificed and made
offerings, and have eaten in your presence the sacrificial meat, and I
petition you to give me a certificate.’  Who to-day, without deep
emotion, can read this paper and measure the trouble and terror of heart
under which the Christians of that day collapsed?”
