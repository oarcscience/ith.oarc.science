<span id="viii.v.iv.xx-p5"></span>Whoever thinks lightly of the meetings
in honour of the holy martyrs, let him be anathema.

<span id="viii.v.iv.xx-p7"></span>Van Espen is of opinion that the
Eustathians had generally rejected the common service as only fit for
the less perfect, and that the martyr chapels are only mentioned here,
because in old times service was usually held there.  According to this
view, no especial weight need be attached to the expression.  But this
canon plainly speaks of a disrespect shown by the Eustathians to the
martyrs.  Compare the twelfth article of the Synodal Letter.  Fuchs
thought that, as the Eustathians resembled the Aerians, who rejected the
service for the dead, the same views might probably be ascribed to the
Eustathians.  But, in the first place, the Aerians are to be regarded
rather as opposed than related in opinion to the Eustathians, being lax
in contrast to these ultra-rigorists.  <span id="page_101">p. 101</span>
<span id="viii.v.iv.xx-Page_101"></span>Besides which, Epiphanius only
says that they rejected prayer for the salvation of the souls of the
departed, but not that they did not honour the martyrs; and there is
surely a great difference between a feast in honour of a saint, and a
requiem for the good of a departed soul.  Why, however, the Eustathians
rejected the veneration of martyrs is nowhere stated; perhaps because
they considered themselves as saints, <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.v.iv.xx-p7.1"></span>κατ᾽ ἐξοχήν</span>, exalted above the
martyrs, who were for the most part only ordinary Christians, and many
of whom had lived in marriage, while according to Eustathian views no
married person could be saved, or consequently could be an object of
veneration.

<span id="viii.v.iv.xx-p8"></span>Lastly, it must be observed that the
first meaning of <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.v.iv.xx-p8.1"></span>σύναξις</span>, is an assembly for divine
service, or the service itself; but here it seems to be taken to mean
<span class="Greek"><span id="viii.v.iv.xx-p8.2"></span>συναγωγή</span>
the place of worship, so that the <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.v.iv.xx-p8.3"></span>συνάξεις τῶν μαρτύρων</span> seems to be
identical with *martyria*, and different from the <span
class="Greek"><span id="viii.v.iv.xx-p8.4"></span>λειτουργίαι</span>
held in them, of which the latter words of the canon speak.
