<span id="xvii.xiii-p49"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.xiii-p49.1"></span>Canon LXXIV.</span>

<span id="xvii.xiii-p50"></span>\[The bishop\] that has the power of
binding and loosing, may lessen the time of penance, to an earnest

id="xvii.xiii-p55.1"></span>Canon LXXVII.</span>

<span id="xvii.xiii-p56"></span>He that divorces his wife, and marries

years, a co-stander one year, if they repent with tears.

<span id="xvii.xiii-p57"></span><span class="c4"><span

mother-in-law, or sister.

<span id="xvii.xiii-p61"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.xiii-p61.1"></span>Canon LXXX.</span>

<span id="xvii.xiii-p62"></span>The Fathers say nothing of polygamy as
being beastly, and a thing unagreeable to human nature.  To us it
appears a greater sin than fornication:  Let therefore such \[as are
guilty of it\] be liable to the canons, viz.:  after they have been
mourners one year—let them be prostrators three years—and then be
received,

<span id="xvii.xiii-p63"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.xiii-p63.1"></span>Canon LXXXI.</span>

<span id="xvii.xiii-p64"></span>They who in the invasion of the
barbarians have after long torments, eaten of magical things offered to
idols, and have sworn heathen oaths, let them not be received for three
years; for two years let them be hearers, for three years prostrators,
so let them be received; but they who did it without force, let them be
ejected three years, be hearers two years, prostrators three years,
co-standers three years, so let them be admitted to communion.

<span id="xvii.xiii-p65"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.xiii-p65.1"></span>Canon LXXXII.</span>

<span id="xvii.xiii-p66"></span>They who by force have been driven to
perjury, let them be admitted after six years; but if without force, let
them be mourners two years, hearers two years, the fifth year
prostrators, two years co-standers.

<span id="xvii.xiii-p67"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.xiii-p67.1"></span>Canon LXXXIII.</span>

<span id="xvii.xiii-p68"></span>They that follow heathenish customs, or
bring men into their houses for the contriving pharmacies, or repelling
them, shall be one year mourners, one year hearers, three years
prostrators, one year co-standers.

<span id="xvii.xiii-p69"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.xiii-p69.1"></span>Canon LXXXIV.</span>

<span id="xvii.xiii-p70"></span>We do not judge altogether by the length
of time, but by the circumstances of the penance.  If any will not be
drawn from their carnal pleasures, and choose to serve them rather than
the Lord, we have no communication with them.

<span id="xvii.xiii-p71"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.xiii-p71.1"></span>Canon LXXXV.</span>

<span id="xvii.xiii-p72"></span>Let us take care that we do not perish
with them; let us warn them by night and day, that we may deliver them
out of the snare or however save ourselves from their condemnation.
