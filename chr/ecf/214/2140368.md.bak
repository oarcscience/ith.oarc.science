<span id="xiii.iii-p4"></span>\[*After a history of the assembly of the
Council, the Acts begin with the Speech of the Papal Legates, as
follows*:\]

<span id="xiii.iii-p5"></span>Most benign lord, in accordance with the
Sacra to our most holy Pope <span id="fr_324"></span>[325](#fn_324.md) from
your God-instructed majesty, we have been sent by him to the most holy
footsteps of your God-confirmed serenity, bearing with us his suggestion
(<span class="Greek"><span id="xiii.iii-p6.1"></span>ἀναφορᾶς</span>,
*suggestione*) as well as the other suggestion of his Synod equally
addressed to your divinely preserved Piety by the venerable bishops
subject to it, which also we offered to your God-crowned Fortitude. 
Since, then, during the past forty-six years, more or less, certain
novelties in expression, contrary to the Orthodox faith, have been
introduced by those who were at several times bishops of this, your
royal and God-preserved city, to wit:  Sergius, Paul, Pyrrhus, and
Peter, as also by Cyrus, at one time archbishop of the city of
Alexandria, as well also as by Theodore, who was bishop of a city called
Pharan, and by certain others their followers, and since these things
have in no small degree brought confusion into the Church throughout the
whole world, for they taught dogmatically that there was but one will in
the dispensation of the Incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ, one of the
Holy Trinity, and one operation; and since many times your servant, our
apostolic see, has fought against this, and then prayed against it, and
by no means been able, even up to now, to draw away from such a depraved
opinion its advocates, we beseech your God-crowned fortitude, that such
as share these views of the most holy church of Constantinople may tell
us, what is the source of this new-fangled language.

<span id="xiii.iii-p7"></span>\[*Answer of the Monothelites made at the
Emperor’s bidding*:\]

<span id="xiii.iii-p8"></span>We have brought out no new method of
speech, but have taught whatever we have received from the holy
Ecumenical Synods, and from the holy approved Fathers, as well as from
the archbishops of this imperial city, to wit:  Sergius, Paul, Pyrrhus,
and Peter, as also from Honorius who was Pope of Old Rome, and from
Cyrus who was Pope of Alexandria, that is to say with reference to will
and operation, and so we have believed, and so we believe, so we preach;
and further we are ready to stand by, and defend this faith.
