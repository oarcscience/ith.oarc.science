<span id="viii.vii.iii.xvi-p7"></span>The only question \[presented by
this canon\] is whether this synod forbade the laity to take any part in
the Church music, as Binius and others have understood the words of the
text, or whether it only intended to forbid those who were not cantors
taking the lead.  Van Espen and Neander in particular were in favour of
the latter meaning, pointing to the fact that certainly in the Greek
Church after the Synod of Laodicea the people were accustomed to join in
the singing, as Chrysostom and Basil the Great sufficiently testify. 
Bingham propounded a peculiar opinion, namely, <span id="page_133">p.
133</span> <span id="viii.vii.iii.xvi-Page_133"></span>that this Synod
did indeed forbid the laity to sing in the church, or even to join in
the singing, but this only temporarily, for certain reasons.  I have no
doubt, however, that Van Espen and Neander take the truer view.
