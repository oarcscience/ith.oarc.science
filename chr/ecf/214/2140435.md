<span id="xiv.iii.lii-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xiv.iii.lii-p1.1"></span>Canon LI.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.lii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.lii-p2.1"></span>This</span> holy and ecumenical synod
altogether forbids those who are called “players,” and their
“spectacles,” as well as the exhibition of hunts, and the theatrical
dances.  If any one despises the present canon, and gives himself to any
of the things which are forbidden, if he be a cleric he shall be
deposed, but if a layman let him be cut off.

<span id="xiv.iii.lii-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.lii-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon LI.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.lii-p5"></span>Whose shall play as an actor or shall
attend theatrical representations or hunts shall be cut off.  Should he
be a cleric he shall be deposed.

<span id="xiv.iii.lii-p7"></span>Some one will enquire why canon xxiiij.
decrees that those in holy orders and monks, who are constantly
attending horse-races, and <span id="page_389">p. 389</span> <span
id="xiv.iii.lii-Page_389"></span>scenic plays, are to cease or be
deposed:  but the present canon says without discrimination, that those
who give themselves over to such things if clergymen are to be deposed,
and if laymen to be cut off.  The solution is this.  It is one thing and
more easily to be endured, that a man should be present at a horse-race,
or be convicted of going to see a play; and another thing, and one that
cannot be pardoned, that he should give himself over to such things, and
to exercise this continually as his business.  Wherefore those who have
once sinned deliberately, are admonished to cease.  If they are not
willing to obey, they are to be deposed.  But those who are constantly
engaged in this wickedness, if they are clerics, they must be deposed
from their clerical place, if laymen they must be cut off.
