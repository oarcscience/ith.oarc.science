id="xiv.iii.xxiii-p2.1"></span>Those</span> who are ordained for money,
whether bishops or of any rank whatever, and not by examination and
choice of life, we order to be deposed as well as those also who
ordained them.

<span id="xiv.iii.xxiii-p5"></span>Whoever is ordained for pay shall be
deposed together with his ordainer.

<span id="xiv.iii.xxiii-p7"></span>The present canon orders to be
deposed not only the one simoniacally ordained, but also his ordainer,
ordering that ordinations should take place on account, not of money,
but of the excellence of the examination stood by the candidate and on
account of his uprightness of life.  And it evidently takes it for
granted that, where money has been used, examination, excellence of
life, and consideration of merit enter but little into the matter, or at
least are paid no attention to.
