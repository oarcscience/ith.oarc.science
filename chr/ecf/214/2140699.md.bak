<span id="xvi.xiv.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xvi.xiv.xiii-p1.1"></span>Canon XIII.</span>

<span id="xvi.xiv.xiii-p2"></span>That they are worthy of special
condemnation who turn the monasteries into public houses.

<span id="xvi.xiv.xiii-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xvi.xiv.xiii-p3.1"></span>During</span> the calamity which was
brought to pass in the Churches, because of our sins, some of the sacred
houses, for example, bishops’ palaces and monasteries, were seized by
certain men and became public inns.  If those who now hold them choose
to give them back, so that they may be restored to their original use,
well and good; but if not, and these persons are on the sacerdotal list,
we command that they be deposed; if they be monks or laymen, that they
be excommunicated, as those who have been condemned from the Father, and
the Son, and the Holy Ghost, and assigned their place where the worm
dieth not and the fire is not quenched, because they set themselves
against the voice of the Lord, which says:  “Make not my Father’s house
an house of merchandise.”

<span id="xvi.xiv.xiii-p5"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xvi.xiv.xiii-p5.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XIII.</span>

<span id="xvi.xiv.xiii-p6"></span>Those who make common diocesan or
monastic goods, unless they restore to the bishop or superior the things
belonging to the diocese or monastery, the whole proceeding shall be
null.  If they are persons in Holy Orders they shall be deposed, but if
laymen or monks they shall be cast out.

<span id="xvi.xiv.xiii-p8"></span>No doubt by “the calamity” here is
intended a reference to the troubles occasioned by the Iconoclasts,
during whose time of domination many nefarious things were perpetrated
against the orthodox, and most bitter of all was the persecution of the
monks and priests by Leo the Isaurian and by his son Constantine
Copronymus, both of them supporters of the Iconoclasts.

<span id="xvi.xiv.xiii-p9"></span>And so it came to pass that by this
persecution and through the nefarious vexations of the Iconoclasts, many
monks and clerics fled from their monasteries and left vacant the
*Episcopia* or holy houses, and so it became easy for people to come in
and occupy the empty monasteries and religious houses, and to turn them
to common and profane uses, especially when the anger of the Emperors
and of the Iconoclasts was known to be fierce against the monks, and
such bishops and priests as were worshippers of images.

<span id="xvi.xiv.xiii-p10"></span>This canon is found in the *Corpus
Juris Canonici*, Pars. II., Causa xix., Quæst. III., canon v., in
Anastasius’s version but lacking the opening words which are supplied by
the Roman Correctors.
