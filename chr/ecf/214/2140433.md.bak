<span id="xiv.iii.l-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.l-p2.1"></span>Renewing</span> also the holy canon, we
decree that the monasteries which have been once consecrated by the
Episcopal will, are always to remain monasteries, and the things which
belong to them are to be preserved to the monastery, and they cannot any
more be secular abodes nor be given by any one to seculars.  But if
anything of this kind has been done already, we declare it to be null;
and those who hereafter attempt to do so are to be subjected to
canonical penalties.

<span id="xiv.iii.l-p5"></span>Monasteries built with the consent of the
bishop shall not afterwards be turned into secular houses, nor shall
they pass into the hands of seculars.

<span id="xiv.iii.l-p7"></span>This canon renews canon xxiv. of
Chalcedon.  And here it may be observed that the canons even of
Ecumenical Synods fall into desuetude little by little, unless the care
of bishops and pastors keeps them alive, and from the example of this
synod it may be seen how often they need calling back again into
observance.

<span id="xiv.iii.l-p8"></span>Nor can there be any doubt that
frequently it would be more advantageous to renew the canons already set
forth by the Fathers, rather than to frame new ones.
