<span id="viii.vii.iii.li-p7"></span>It is doubtful whether by the
Thursday of the text was meant only the Thursday of Holy Week, or every
Thursday of the time during which the catechumens received instruction. 
The Greek commentators are in favour of the latter, but Dionysius
Exiguus and Isidore, and after them Bingham, are, and probably rightly,
in favour of the former meaning.  This canon was repeated by the Trullan
Synod in its seventy-eighth canon.
