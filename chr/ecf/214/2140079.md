<span id="viii.iii.iii.xviii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.xviii-p2.1"></span>If</span> any who have been
constituted bishops, but have not been received by the parish to which
they were designated, shall invade other parishes and wrong the
constituted \[bishops\] there, stirring up seditions against them, let
such persons be suspended from office and communion.  But if they are
willing to accept a seat among the presbyterate, where they formerly
were presbyters, let them not be deprived of that honour.  But if they
shall act seditiously against the bishops established there, the honour
of the presbyterate also shall be taken from them and themselves
expelled.

id="viii.iii.iii.xviii-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon
XVIII.</span>

<span id="viii.iii.iii.xviii-p5"></span>If a bishop who has been duly
constituted, is not received by the Church to which he was elected, but
gives trouble to other bishops, let him be excommunicated.

<span id="viii.iii.iii.xviii-p6"></span>If he wishes to be numbered
among the presbyters, let him be so numbered.  But if he shall be at
outs with the bishops duly constituted there, let him be deprived of the
honour of being even a presbyter.

<span id="viii.iii.iii.xviii-p7"></span>The word I have translated
“suspended from office and communion” is <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.xviii-p7.1"></span>ἀφορίζεσθαι</span> .  Suicer in his
*Thesaurus* shews that this word does not mean only, as some have
supposed, a deprivation of office and dignity (e.g., Van Espen), but
also an exclusion from the communion of the Church.
