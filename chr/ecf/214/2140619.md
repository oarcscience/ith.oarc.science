<span id="xv.iv.iv.xcvi-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xcvi-p1.1"></span>Canon XCV.  (Greek xcviii.)</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xcvi-p2"></span>An universal council to be held only
when necessary.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xcvi-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xcvi-p3.1"></span>It</span> seemed good that there should
be no more the yearly necessity of fatiguing the brethren; but as often
as common cause, that is of the whole of Africa, demands, that letters
shall be given on every side to that see in this matter, that a synod
should be gathered in that province, where the desirability of it
induces; but let the causes which are not of general interest be judged
in their own provinces.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xcvi-p5"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xcvi-p5.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XCV.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xcvi-p6"></span>When general necessity so urges,
letters are to be sent to the chief see, and a synod held in a
convenient place.  But let ordinary causes be settled in their own
provinces.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xcvi-p7"></span>This canon is Canon j. of the Synod
of Carthage, <span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xcvi-p7.1"></span>a.d.</span> 407.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xcvi-p9"></span>This canon is a tacit revocation of
that clause for annual synods in the 18th canon, which was made in a
former council.
