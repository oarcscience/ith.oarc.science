id="x.ix.xiii-p2.1"></span>Whosoever</span> shall not confess that the
flesh of the Lord giveth life and that it pertains to the Word of God
the Father as his very own, but shall pretend that it belongs to another
person who is united to him \[i.e., the Word\] only according to honour,
and who has served as a dwelling for the divinity; and shall not rather
confess, as we say, that that flesh giveth life because it is that of
the Word who giveth life to all:  let him be anathema.

<span id="x.ix.xiii-p6"></span>If any one maintains that the flesh which
is united with God the Word is by the power of its own nature
life-giving, whereas the Lord himself says, “It is the Spirit that
quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing” ([John
6.61](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#061.md)<span
id="x.ix.xiii-p6.1"></span>), let him be anathema.  \[He adds, “God is a
Spirit” ([John 4.24](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#024.md)<span
id="x.ix.xiii-p6.2"></span>).  If, then, any one maintains that God the
Logos has in a carnal manner, in his substance, become flesh, and
persists in this with reference to the Lord Christ; who himself after
his resurrection said to his disciples, “Handle me and see; for a spirit
hath not flesh and bones, as ye behold me having” ([Luke
24.39](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#039.md)<span
id="x.ix.xiii-p6.3"></span>); let him be anathema.\]

<span id="x.ix.xiii-p10"></span>(*Declaratio undecima*.)

<span id="x.ix.xiii-p11"></span>We perform in the churches the holy,
lifegiving, and unbloody sacrifice; the body, as also the precious
blood, which is exhibited we believe not to be that of a common man and
of any one like unto us, but receiving it rather as his own body and as
the blood of the Word which gives all things life.  For common flesh
cannot give life.  And this our Saviour himself testified when he said: 
“The flesh profiteth nothing, it is the Spirit that giveth life.”  For
since the flesh became the very own of the Word, therefore we understand
that it is lifegiving, as the Saviour himself said:  “As the living
Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father; so he that eateth me
shall live by me.”  Since therefore Nestorius and those who think with
him rashly dissolve the power of this mystery; therefore it was
convenient that this anathematism should be put forth.
