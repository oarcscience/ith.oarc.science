<span id="xvi.xiv.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xvi.xiv.xv-p1.1"></span>Canon XV.</span>

<span id="xvi.xiv.xv-p2"></span>That a clerk ought not to be set over
two churches.

<span id="xvi.xiv.xv-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xvi.xiv.xv-p3.1"></span>From</span> henceforth no clergyman shall be
appointed over two churches, for this savours of merchandise and filthy
lucre, and is altogether alien from ecclesiastical custom.  We have
heard by the very voice of the Lord that, “No man can serve two masters,
for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will hold
to the one and despise the other.”  Each one, therefore, as says the
Apostle, in the calling wherein he was called, in the same he ought to
abide, and in one only church to give attendance.  For in the affairs of
the Church, what is gained through filthy lucre is altogether separate
from God.  To meet the necessities of this life, there are various
occupations, by means of which, if one so desire, let him procure the
things needful for the body.  For says the Apostle, “These hands have
ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me.” 
Occupations of this sort may be obtained in the God-protected city.  But
in the country places outside, because of the small number of people,
let a dispensation be granted.

<span id="xvi.xiv.xv-p5"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xvi.xiv.xv-p5.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XV.</span>

<span id="xvi.xiv.xv-p6"></span>Hereafter at Constantinople a cleric may
not serve two churches.  But in the outskirts this may be permitted on
account of the scarcity of men.

<span id="xvi.xiv.xv-p7"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xvi.xiv.xv-p7.1"></span>Van Espen.</span>

<span id="xvi.xiv.xv-p8"></span>This means that in the country or where
men are so scarce that each parish cannot have its own presbyter, one
presbyter should be allowed to serve two churches, not that so he may
supply his own need, (as to-day is allowed by the combination of
benefices), but that so the necessities of the parishioners may be
provided for.

<span id="xvi.xiv.xv-p9"></span>It should be noted that the synod deems
it “filthy lucre” and “separate from God” if ecclesiastical ministries
are performed “for the necessaries of life,” and is of opinion that the
clergy should seek their support from some honest employment or work by
the example of Paul, rather than to turn ecclesiastical ministrations to
the attaining of temporal things, and to use these as an art by which to
gain bread.

<span id="xvi.xiv.xv-p10"></span>This canon is found in the *Corpus
Juris Canonici,* Pars. II., Causa XXI., Quæst. I, canon j. where the
gloss is “because there the clergy are few.”
