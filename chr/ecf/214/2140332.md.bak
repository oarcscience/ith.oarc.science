<span id="xi.xviii.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xi.xviii.xiv-p1.1"></span>Canon XIV.</span>

<span id="xi.xviii.xiv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xi.xviii.xiv-p2.1"></span>Since</span> in certain provinces it is
permitted to the readers and singers to marry, the holy Synod has
decreed that it shall not be lawful for any of them to take a wife that
is heterodox.  But those who have already begotten children of such a
marriage, if they have already had their children baptized among the
heretics, must bring them into the communion of the Catholic Church; but
if they have not had them baptized, they may not hereafter baptize them
among heretics, nor give them in marriage to a heretic, or a Jew, or a
heathen, unless the person marrying the orthodox child shall promise to
come over to the orthodox faith.  And if any one shall transgress this
decree of the holy synod, let him be subjected to canonical censure.

<span id="xi.xviii.xiv-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xi.xviii.xiv-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XIV.</span>

<span id="xi.xviii.xiv-p5"></span>A Cantor or Lector alien to the sound
faith, if being then married, he shall have begotten children let him
bring them to communion, if they had there been baptized.  But if they
had not yet been baptized they shall not be baptized afterwards by the
heretics.

<span id="xi.xviii.xiv-p7"></span>The tenth and thirty-first canons of
the Synod of Laodicea and the second of the Sixth Synod in Trullo, and
this present canon forbid one of the orthodox to be joined in marriage
with a woman who is a heretic, or vice versa.  But if any of the Cantors
or Lectors had taken a wife of another sect before these canons were set
forth, and had had children by her, and had had them baptized while yet
he remained among the heretics, these he should bring to the communion
of the Catholic Church.  But if they had not yet been baptized, he must
not turn back and have them baptized among heretics.  But departing
thence let him lead them to the Catholic Church and enrich them with
divine baptism.

<span id="xi.xviii.xiv-p9"></span>According to the Latin translation of
Dionysius Exiguus, who speaks only of the *daughters* of the lectors,
etc., the meaning may be understood, with Christian Lupus, as being that
only their *daughters* must not be married to heretics or Jews or
heathen, but that the sons of readers may take wives who are heretics,
etc., because that men are less easily led to fall away from the faith
than women.  But the Greek text makes here no distinction between sons
and daughters.

<span id="xi.xviii.xiv-p11"></span>It is to Victor that we owe the most
striking of all anecdotes about readers.  During the former persecution
under Genseric (or Gaiseric), the Arians attacked a Catholic
congregation on Easter Sunday; and while a reader was standing alone in
the pulpit, and chanting the “Alleluia melody” (*cf*. Hammond,
*Liturgies*, p. 95), an arrow pierced his throat, the “codex” dropped
from his hands, and he fell down dead (*De Persec. Vand*., i., 13). 
Five years before the Council, a boy of eight named Epiphanius was made
a reader in the church of Pavia, and in process of time became famous as
its bishop.  Justinian forbade readers to be appointed under eighteen
(Novel., 134, 13).  The office is described in the Greek Euchologion as
“the first step to the priesthood,” and is conferred with delivery of
the book containing the Epistles.  Isidore of Seville, in the seventh
century, tells us that the bishop ordained a reader by delivering to him
“coram plebe,” the “codex” of Scripture:  and after giving precise
directions as to pronunciation and accentuation, says that the readers
were of old called “heralds” (*De Eccl. Offic*., ii., 11).  (b) The
Singers are placed by the xliijrd. Apostolic canon between subdeacons
and readers, but they rank below readers in Laodic., c. 23, in the
Liturgy of St. Mark (Hammond, p. 173), and in the canons wrongly
ascribed to a <span class="sc"><span
id="xi.xviii.xiv-p11.1"></span>IV</span>th Council of Carthage, which
permit a presbyter to appoint a “psalmist” without the bishop’s
knowledge, and rank him even below the doorkeepers (Mansi, iii., 952). 
The chief passage respecting the ancient “singers” is Laodic., xv.

<span id="xi.xviii.xiv-p12"></span>The first part of this canon is found
in the *Corpus Juris Canonici*, Gratian’s *Decretum*, Pars I, Dist.
xxxii. c. xv.
