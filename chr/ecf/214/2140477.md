<span id="xiv.iii.xciv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.xciv-p2.1"></span>If</span> the wife of a man who has gone
away and does not appear, cohabit with another before she is assured of
the death of the first, she is an adulteress.  The wives of soldiers who
have married husbands who do not appear are in the same case; as are
also they who on account of the wanderings of their husbands do not wait
for their return.  But the circumstance here has some excuse, in that
the suspicion of his death becomes very great.  But she who in ignorance
has married a man who at the time was deserted by his wife, and then is
dismissed because his first wife returns to him, has indeed committed
fornication, but through ignorance; therefore she is not prevented from
marrying, but it is better if she remain as she is.  If a soldier shall
return after a long time, and find his wife on account of his long
absence has been united to another man, if he so wishes, he may receive
his own wife \[back again\], pardon being extended in consideration of
their ignorance both to her and to the man who took her home in second
marriage.

<span id="xiv.iii.xciv-p5"></span>A woman who when her husband does not
turn up, before she is certain he is dead, takes another commits
adultery.  But when the man returns he may receive her again, if he so
elects.

Canonici*, Gratian’s *Decretum*, Pars II., Causa xxxiv., Quæst. I. and
II.  Epistle of St. Leo to Nicetas.  Also compare of St. Basil’s canon’s
xxxj., xxxvj., and xlvj.
