<span id="xiv.iii.lvi-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xiv.iii.lvi-p1.1"></span>Canon LV.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.lvi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.lvi-p2.1"></span>Since</span> we understand that in the city
of the Romans, in the holy fast of Lent they fast on the Saturdays,
contrary to the ecclesiastical observance which is traditional, it
seemed good to the holy synod that also in the Church of the Romans the
canon shall immovably stands fast which says:  “If any cleric shall be
found to fast on a Sunday or Saturday (except on one occasion only) he
is to be deposed; and if he is a layman he shall be cut off.”

<span id="xiv.iii.lvi-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.lvi-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon LV.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.lvi-p5"></span>The Romans fast the Sabbaths of Lent. 
Therefore this Synod admonishes that upon these days the Apostolical
canon is of force.

<span id="xiv.iii.lvi-p6"></span>The canon quoted is LXVI. of the
Apostolic Canons.

<span id="xiv.iii.lvi-p8"></span>The Fathers of this Synod thought that
this canon of the Apostles was edited by the Apostles themselves, and
therefore they seem to have reprobated the custom of the Roman Church of
fasting on the Sabbath more bitterly than was right.  Whence it happens
this is one of those canons which the Roman Church never received.

<span id="xiv.iii.lvi-p10"></span>The synod took in hand to correct this
failing (<span class="Greek"><span
id="xiv.iii.lvi-p10.1"></span>σφάλμα</span>) of the Latins; but until
this time they have arrogantly remained in their pertinacity, and so
remain to-day.  Nor do they heed the ancient canons which forbid fasting
on the Sabbath except that one, to wit the great Sabbath, nor are they
affected by the authority of this canon.  Moreover the clerics have no
regard for the threatened deposition, nor the laymen for their being cut
off.
