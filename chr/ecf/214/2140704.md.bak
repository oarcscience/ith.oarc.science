<span id="xvi.xiv.xviii-Page_567"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvi.xiv.xviii-p1.1"></span>Canon XVIII.</span>

<span id="xvi.xiv.xviii-p2"></span>That women ought not to live in
bishops’ houses, nor in monasteries of men.

<span id="xvi.xiv.xviii-p3"></span>“<span class="sc"><span
id="xvi.xiv.xviii-p3.1"></span>Be</span> ye without offence to those who
are without,” says the divine Apostle.  Now for women to live in
Bishops’ houses or in monasteries is ground for grave offence.  Whoever
therefore is known to have a female slave or freewoman in the episcopal
palace or in a monastery for the discharge of some service, let him be
rebuked.  And if he still continue to retain her, let him be deposed. 
If it happens that women are on the suburban estates, and the bishop or
hegumenos desires to go thither, so long as the bishop or hegumenos is
present, let no woman at that time continue her work, but let her betake
herself to some other place until the bishop \[or hegumenos <span
id="fr_541"></span>[542](#fn_541.md) \] has departed, so that there be no
occasion of complaint.

<span id="xvi.xiv.xviii-p6"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xvi.xiv.xviii-p6.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XVIII.</span>

<span id="xvi.xiv.xviii-p7"></span>It is not fitting that women should
be kept in episcopal houses or in monasteries.  If anyone shall dare to
do so, he shall be reproved; but if he persists, he shall be deposed. 
No woman is allowed to serve or even to appear where a bishop or a
superior of a monastery is present, but let her keep herself apart until
he be gone.

<span id="xvi.xiv.xviii-p9"></span>Every woman the present canon expels
from the *Episcopium* or bishop’s house, agreeably to Novel CXXIII,
chapter 29, of the Emperor Justinian, which, (although the Nicene canon
on the subject makes a mother, sister, daughter and other persons free
from all suspicions, exceptions), admits no exceptions in the case of a
bishop, but says, “We allow no bishop to have any woman or to live with
one.”

<span id="xvi.xiv.xviii-p10"></span>For as bishops are set in a higher
grade above the rest of the clergy, and ought to be like lights set on a
candlestick to give light, rightly they are ordered more than others to
take care to avoid all appearance of evil, and to remove all from them
that might cause suspicion.

<span id="xvi.xiv.xviii-p11"></span>With regard to monks and their
houses see Justinian’s Novel CXXXIII., Cap. IV.
