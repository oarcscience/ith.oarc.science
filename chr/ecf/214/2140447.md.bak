id="xiv.iii.lxiv-p2.1"></span>We</span> forbid to be publicly read in
Church, histories of the martyrs which have been falsely put together by
the enemies of the truth, in order to dishonour the martyrs of Christ
and induce unbelief among those who hear them, but we order that such
books be given to the flames.  But those who accept them or apply their
mind to them as true we anathematize.

<span id="xiv.iii.lxiv-p6"></span>What is condemned is false histories
of true martyrs, not (as Johnson erroneously supposes) “false legends of
pretended martyrs.”  There have been martyrs, both royal and plebeian,
in much later times whose lives have been made ridiculous and whose
memory has been rendered hateful to the ignorant people by so-called
“histories” which might well have received the treatment ordered by the
canon.
