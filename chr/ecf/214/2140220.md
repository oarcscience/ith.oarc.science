id="viii.vii.iii.liv-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XLIX.</span>

<span id="viii.vii.iii.liv-p5"></span>In Lent the offering should be
made only on the Sabbath and on the Lord’s day.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.liv-p6"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.vii.iii.liv-p6.1"></span>Hefele.</span>

<span id="viii.vii.iii.liv-p7"></span>This canon, which was repeated by
the Trullan Synod in its fifty-second canon, orders that on ordinary
week days during Lent, only a *Missa Præsanctificatorum* should take
place, as is still the custom with the Greeks on all days of penitence
and mourning, when it appears to them unsuitable to have the full
liturgy, and as Leo Allatius says, for this reason, that the
consecration is a joyful act.  A comparison of the above sixteenth
canon, however, shows that Saturday was a special exception.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.liv-p8"></span>To the Saturdays and Sundays
mentioned by Hefele must be added the feast of the Annunciation, which
is always solemnized with a full celebration of the Liturgy, even when
it falls upon Good Friday.
