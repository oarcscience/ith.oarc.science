<span id="vii.vi.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="vii.vi.xiii-p1.1"></span>Excursus on the Chorepiscopi.</span>

<span id="vii.vi.xiii-p2"></span>There has been much difference of
opinion among the learned touching the status of the Chorepiscopus in
the early Church.  The main question in dispute is as to whether they
were always, sometimes, or never, in episcopal orders.  Most Anglican
writers, including Beveridge, Hammond, Cave, and Routh, have affirmed
the first proposition, that they were true bishops, but that, out of
respect to the bishop of the City they were forbidden the exercise of
certain of their episcopal functions, except upon extraordinary
occasions.  With this view Binterim <span id="fr_70"></span>[71](#fn_70.md)
also agrees, and Augusti is of the same opinion. <span
id="fr_71"></span>[72](#fn_71.md)   But Thomassinus is of a different mind,
thinking, so says Hefele, <span id="fr_72"></span>[73](#fn_72.md) that
there were “two classes of chorepiscopi, of whom the one were real
bishops, while the other had only the title without consecration.”

<span id="vii.vi.xiii-p6"></span>The third opinion, that they were
merely presbyters, is espoused by Morinus and Du Cange, and others who
are named by Bingham. <span id="fr_73"></span>[74](#fn_73.md)   This last
opinion is now all but universally rejected, to the other two we shall
now devote our attention.

<span id="vii.vi.xiii-p8"></span>For the first opinion no one can speak
more learnedly nor more authoritatively than Arthur West Haddon, who
writes as follows;

<span id="vii.vi.xiii-p9"></span>(Haddon, *Dict. Christ. Antiq. s.v.*
Chorepiscopus.)

<span id="vii.vi.xiii-p10"></span>The chorepiscopus was called into
existence in the latter part of the third century, and first in Asia
Minor, in order to meet the want of episcopal supervision in the country
parts of the now enlarged dioceses without subdivision.  \[They are\]
first mentioned in the Councils of Ancyra and Neo-Cæsarea <span
class="sc"><span id="vii.vi.xiii-p10.1"></span>a.d.</span> 314, and
again in the Council of Nice (which is subscribed by fifteen, all from
Asia Minor or Syria).  \[They became\] sufficiently important to require
restriction by the time of the Council of Antioch, <span
class="sc"><span id="vii.vi.xiii-p10.2"></span>a.d.</span> 341; and
continued to exist in the East until at least the ninth century, when
they were supplanted by <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.vi.xiii-p10.3"></span>ἔξαρχοι</span>.  \[Chorepiscopi are\]
first mentioned in the West in the Council of Riez, <span
class="sc"><span id="vii.vi.xiii-p10.4"></span>a.d.</span> 439 (the
Epistles of Pope Damasus I. and of Leo. M. respecting them being
forgeries), and continued there (but not in Africa, principally in
France) until about the tenth century, after which the name occurs (in a
decree of Pope Damasus II. ap. Sigeb. *in an*. 1048) as equivalent to
archdeacon, an office from which the Arabic Nicene canons expressly
distinguish it.  The functions of chorepiscopi, as well as their name,
were of an episcopal, not of a presbyterial kind, although limited to
minor offices.  They overlooked the country district committed to them,
“*loco episcopi*,” ordaining readers, exorcists, subdeacons, but, as a
rule, not deacons or presbyters (and of course not bishops), unless by
express permission of their diocesan bishop.  They confirmed in their
own districts, and (in Gaul) are mentioned as consecrating churches
(*vide* Du Cange).  They granted <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.vi.xiii-p10.5"></span>εἰρενικαὶ</span>, or letters dimissory,
which country presbyters were forbidden to do.  They had also the
honorary privilege (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.vi.xiii-p10.6"></span>τιμώμενοι</span> ) of assisting at the
celebration of the Holy Eucharist in the mother city church, which
country presbyters had not (*Conc. Ancyr*. can. xiii.; *Neo-Cæsar*. can.
xiv.; *Antioch*, can. x.; St. Basil M. *Epist.* 181; Rab. Maur. *De
Instit*. *Cler*. i. 5, etc. etc.).  They were held therefore to have
power of ordination, but to lack jurisdiction, save subordinately.  And
the actual ordination of a presbyter by Timotheus, a chorepiscopus, is
recorded (Pallad., *Hist. Lausiac.* 106).

<span id="vii.vi.xiii-p11"></span><span id="page_22">p. 22</span> <span
id="vii.vi.xiii-Page_22"></span>In the West, i.e. chiefly in Gaul, the
order appears to have prevailed more widely, to have usurped episcopal
functions without due subordination to the diocesans, and to have been
also taken advantage of by idle or worldly diocesans.  In consequence it
seems to have aroused a strong feeling of hostility, which showed
itself, first in a series of papal bulls, condemning them; headed, it is
true, by two forged letters respectively of Damasus I. and Leo. M. (of
which the latter is merely an interpolated version of *Conc. Hispal.*
II. <span class="sc"><span id="vii.vi.xiii-p11.1"></span>a.d.</span>
619, can. 7, adding *chorepiscopi* to *presbyteri*, of which latter the
council really treats), but continuing in a more genuine form, from Leo
III. down to Pope Nicholas I. (to Rodolph, Archbishop of Bourges, <span
class="sc"><span id="vii.vi.xiii-p11.2"></span>a.d.</span> 864); the
last of whom, however, takes the more moderate line of affirming
chorepiscopi to be really bishops, and consequently refusing to annul
their ordinations of presbyters and deacons (as previous popes had
done), but orders them to keep within canonical limits; and secondly, in
a series of conciliar decrees, *Conc. Ratispon.* <span class="sc"><span
id="vii.vi.xiii-p11.3"></span>a.d.</span> 800, in *Capit*. lib. iv. *c*.
1, *Paris.* <span class="sc"><span
id="vii.vi.xiii-p11.4"></span>a.d.</span> 829, lib. i.c. 27; *Meld.*
<span class="sc"><span id="vii.vi.xiii-p11.5"></span>a.d.</span> 845,
can. 44; *Metens.* <span class="sc"><span
id="vii.vi.xiii-p11.6"></span>a.d.</span> 888, can. 8, and *Capitul*. v.
168, vi. 119, vii. 187, 310, 323, 324, annulling all episcopal acts of
chorepiscopi, and ordering them to be repeated by “true” bishops; and
finally forbidding all further appointments of chorepiscopi at all.

<span id="vii.vi.xiii-p12"></span>That chorepiscopi as such—i.e.
omitting the cases of reconciled or vacant bishops above mentioned, of
whose episcopate of course no question is made—were at first truly
bishops both in East and West, appears almost certain, both from their
name and functions, and even from the arguments of their strong
opponents just spoken of.  If nothing more could be urged against them,
than that the Council of Neo-Cæsarea compared them to the Seventy
disciples, that the Council of Antioch authorises their consecration by
a single bishop, and that they actually were so consecrated (the
Antiochene decree *might* mean merely nomination by the word <span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.vi.xiii-p12.1"></span>γίνεσθαι</span>, but
the actual history seems to rule the term to intend consecration, and
the \[one\] exceptional case of a chorepiscopus recorded \[*Actt. Episc.
Cenoman. ap.* Du Cange\] in late times to have been ordained by three
bishops \[in order that he *might* be a full bishop\] merely proves the
general rule to the contrary)—and that they were consecrated for
“villages,” contrary to canon,—then they certainly were bishops.  And
Pope Nicholas expressly says that they were so.  Undoubtedly they ceased
to be so in the East, and were practically merged in archdeacons in the
West.

<span id="vii.vi.xiii-p13"></span>For the second opinion, its great
champion, Thomassinus shall speak.

<span id="vii.vi.xiii-p14"></span>(Thomassin, *Ancienne et Nouvelle
Discipline de l’Église*, Tom. I. Livre II. chap 1. § iii.)

<span id="vii.vi.xiii-p15"></span>The chorepiscopi were not duly
consecrated bishops, unless some bishop had consecrated a bishop for a
town and the bishop thus ordained contrary to the canons was tolerated
on condition of his submitting himself to the diocesan as though he were
only a chorepiscopus.  This may be gathered from the fifty-seventh canon
of Laodicea.

<span id="vii.vi.xiii-p16"></span>From this canon two conclusions may be
drawn, 1st. That bishops ought not to be ordained for villages, and that
as Chorepiscopi could only be placed in villages they could not be
bishops.  2d. That sometimes by accident a chorepiscopus might be a
bishop, but only through having been canonically lowered to that rank.

<span id="vii.vi.xiii-p17"></span>The Council of Nice furnishes another
example of a bishop lowered to the rank of a chorepiscopus in Canon
viii.  This canon shows that they should not have been bishops, for two
bishops could never be in a diocese, although this might accidentally be
the case when a chorepiscopus happened to be a bishop.

<span id="vii.vi.xiii-p18"></span>This is the meaning which must be
given to the tenth canon of Antioch, which directs that chorepiscopi,
even if they have received episcopal orders, and have been consecrated
bishops, shall keep within the limits prescribed by the canon; that in
cases of necessity, they ordain <span id="page_23">p. 23</span> <span
id="vii.vi.xiii-Page_23"></span>the lower clergy; but that they be
careful not to ordain priests or deacons, because this power is
absolutely reserved to the Diocesan.  It must be added that as the
council of Antioch commands that the Diocesan without any other bishop
can ordain the chorepiscopus, the position can no longer be sustained
that the chorepiscopi were bishops, such a method of consecrating a
bishop being contrary to canon xix. of the same council, moreover the
canon does not say the chorepiscopus is to be ordained, but uses the
word <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.vi.xiii-p18.1"></span>γένεσθαι</span> by the bishop of the city
(canon x.).  The Council of Neocæsarea by referring them to the seventy
disciples (in Canon XIV.) has shown the chorepiscopi to be only priests.

<span id="vii.vi.xiii-p19"></span>But the Council of Ancyra does furnish
a difficulty, for the text seems to permit chorepiscopi to ordain
priests.  But the Greek text must be corrected by the ancient Latin
versions.  The letter attributed to pope Nicholas, <span
class="sc"><span id="vii.vi.xiii-p19.1"></span>a.d.</span> 864, must be
considered a forgery since he recognises the chorepiscopi as real
bishops.

<span id="vii.vi.xiii-p20"></span>If Harmenopulus, Aristenus, Balsamon,
and Zonaras seem to accord to the chorepiscopi the power to ordain
priests and deacons with the permission of the Diocesan, it is because
they are explaining the meaning and setting forth the practice of the
ancient councils and not the practice of their own times.  But at all
events it is past all doubt that before the seventh century there were,
by different accidents, chorepiscopi who were really bishops and that
these could, with the consent of the diocesan, ordain priests.  But at
the time these authors wrote, there was not a single chorepiscopus in
the entire East, as Balsamon frankly admits in commenting on Canon xiii.
of Ancyra.

<span id="vii.vi.xiii-p21"></span>Whether in the foregoing the reader
will think Thomassinus has proved his point, I do not know, but so far
as the position of the chorepiscopi in synods is concerned there can be
no doubt whatever, and I shall allow Hefele to speak on this point.

<span id="vii.vi.xiii-p22"></span>(Hefele, *History of the Councils*,
Vol. I. pp. 17, 18.)

<span id="vii.vi.xiii-p23"></span>The *Chorepiscopi* (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.vi.xiii-p23.1"></span>χωρεπίσκοποι</span>),
or bishops of country places, seem to have been considered in ancient
times as quite on a par with the other bishops, as far as their position
in synod was concerned.  We meet with them at the Councils of Neocæsarea
in the year 314, of Nicæa in 325, of Ephesus in 431.  On the other hand,
among the 600 bishops of the fourth Ecumenical Council at Chalcedon in
451, there is no chorepiscopus present, for by this time the office had
been abolished; but in the Middle Ages we again meet with chorepiscopi
of a new kind at Western councils, particularly at those of the French
Church, at Langres in 830, at Mayence in 847, at Pontion in 876, at
Lyons in 886, at Douzy in 871.
