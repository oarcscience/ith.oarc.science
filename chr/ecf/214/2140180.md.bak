<span id="viii.vii.iii.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="viii.vii.iii.xiv-p1.1"></span>Canon XIII.</span>

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xiv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.vii.iii.xiv-p2.1"></span>The</span> election of those who are
to be appointed to the priesthood is not to be committed to the
multitude.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xiv-p3"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="viii.vii.iii.xiv-p3.1"></span>Notes.</span>

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xiv-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.vii.iii.xiv-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XIII.</span>

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xiv-p5"></span>Whoso is chosen by seculars is
ineligible.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xiv-p6"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.vii.iii.xiv-p6.1"></span>Balsamon.</span>

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xiv-p7"></span>From this canon it is evident that
in ancient times not only bishops but also priests were voted for by the
multitude of the people.  This is here forbidden.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xiv-p8"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.vii.iii.xiv-p8.1"></span>Aristenus.</span>

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xiv-p9"></span>Bishops are elected by
metropolitans and other bishops.  If anyone in this manner shall not
have been promoted to the Episcopate, but shall have been chosen by the
multitude, he is not to be admitted nor elected.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xiv-p10"></span>\[It is clear from this that by
“the Priesthood” Aristenus understands the episcopate, and I think
rightly.\]

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xiv-p11"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.vii.iii.xiv-p11.1"></span>Van Espen.</span>

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xiv-p12"></span>The word in the Greek to which
“multitude” corresponds (<span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.vii.iii.xiv-p12.1"></span>ὄχλος</span>) properly signifies a
tumult. <span id="fr_175"></span>[176](#fn_175.md)

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xiv-p14"></span>What the fathers intend to forbid
are tumultuous elections, that is, that no attention is to be paid to
riotous demonstrations on the part of the people, when with acclamations
they are demanding the ordination of anyone, with an appearance of
sedition.  Such a state of affairs St. Augustine admirably describes in
his *Epistola ad Albinam* (*Epist*. cxxvi., Tom. II, col. 548, Ed.
Gaume).

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xiv-p15"></span>And it is manifest that by this
canon the people were not excluded from all share in the election of
bishops and priests from what St. Gregory Nazianzen says, in *Epistola
ad Cæsarienses*, with regard to the election of St. Basil.  From this
what could be more evident than that after this canon was put out the
people in the East still had their part in the election of a bishop? 
This also is clear from Justinian’s “Novels” (*Novellæ*, cxxiij., c.j.,
and cxxxvij., c. ij.)

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xiv-p16"></span>This canon is found in the
*Corpus Juris Canonici*, Gratian’s *Decretum*, Pars I., Dist. lxiii.,
can. vj,, but in proof of the proposition that laymen were hereby
forbidden to have any share in elections.  Van Espen notes that
Isidore’s version favours Gratian’s misunderstanding, and says that “no
doubt that this version did much to exclude the people from the election
of bishops.”
