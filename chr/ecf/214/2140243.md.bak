<span id="ix.viii.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="ix.viii.iii-p1.1"></span>Canon II.</span>

<span id="ix.viii.iii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.viii.iii-p2.1"></span>The</span> bishops are not to go beyond
their dioceses to churches lying outside of their bounds, nor bring
confusion on the churches; but let the Bishop of Alexandria, according
to the canons, alone administer the affairs of Egypt; and let the
bishops of the East manage the East alone, the privileges of the Church
in Antioch, which are mentioned in the canons of Nice, being preserved;
and let the bishops of the Asian Diocese administer the Asian affairs
only; and the Pontic bishops only Pontic matters; and the Thracian
bishops only Thracian affairs.  And let not bishops go beyond their
dioceses for ordination or any other ecclesiastical ministrations,
unless they be invited.  And the aforesaid canon concerning dioceses
being observed, it is evident that the <span id="page_177">p. 177</span>
<span id="ix.viii.iii-Page_177"></span>synod of every province will
administer the affairs of that particular province as was decreed at
Nice.  But the Churches of God in heathen nations must be governed
according to the custom which has prevailed from the times of the
Fathers.

<span id="ix.viii.iii-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.viii.iii-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon II.</span>

<span id="ix.viii.iii-p5"></span>No traveller shall introduce confusion
into the Churches either by ordaining or by enthroning.  Nevertheless in
Churches which are among the heathen the tradition of the Fathers shall
be preserved.

<span id="ix.viii.iii-p6"></span>In the above Ancient Epitome it will be
noticed that not only is ordination mentioned but also the
“inthronization” of bishops.  Few ceremonies are of greater antiquity in
the Christian Church than the solemn placing of the newly chosen bishop
in the episcopal chair of his diocese.  It is mentioned in the
Apostolical Constitutions, and in the Greek Pontificals.  Also in the
Arabic version of the Nicene Canons.  (No. lxxi.).  A sermon was usually
delivered by the newly consecrated bishop, called the “sermo
enthronisticus.”  He also sent to neighbouring bishops <span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.viii.iii-p6.1"></span>συλλαβαὶ
ἐνθρονιστικαὶ</span>, and the fees the new bishops paid were called
<span class="Greek"><span id="ix.viii.iii-p6.2"></span>τὰ
ἐνθρονιστικὰ</span>.

<span id="ix.viii.iii-p7"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.viii.iii-p7.1"></span>Valesius.</span>

<span id="ix.viii.iii-p8"></span>(Note on Socrates, *H. E*., v., 8).

<span id="ix.viii.iii-p9"></span>This rule seems to have been made
chiefly on account of Meletius, Bishop of Antioch, Gregory Nazianzen,
and Peter of Alexandria.  For Meletius leaving the Eastern diocese had
come to Constantinople to ordain Gregory bishop there.  And Gregory
having abandoned the bishoprick of Sasima, which was in the Pontic
diocese, had removed to Constantinople.  While Peter of Alexandria had
sent to Constantinople seven Egyptian bishops to ordain Maximus the
Cynic.  For the purpose therefore of repressing these \[disorders\], the
fathers of the Synod of Constantinople made this canon.

<span id="ix.viii.iii-p10"></span><span class="sc"><span

<span id="ix.viii.iii-p11"></span>Take notice from the present canon
that formerly all the Metropolitans of provinces were themselves the
heads of their own provinces, and were ordained by their own synods. 
But all this was changed by Canon xxviij of the Synod of Chalcedon,
which directs that the Metropolitans of the dioceses of Pontus, Asia,
and Thrace, and certain others which are mentioned in this Canon should
be ordained by the Patriarch of Constantinople and should be subject to
him.  But if you find other churches which are autocephalous as the
Church of Bulgaria, of Cyprus, of Iberia, you need not be astonished. 
For the Emperor Justinian gave this honour to the Archbishop of
Bulgaria.…The third Synod gave this honour to the Archbishop of Cyprus,
and by the law of the same synod (Canon viii.), and by the Sixth Synod
in its xxxixth Canon, the judgment of the Synod of Antioch is annulled
and this honour granted to the bishop of Iberia.

<span id="ix.viii.iii-p13"></span>(*Mém*. ix., 489).

<span id="ix.viii.iii-p14"></span>The Council seems likewise to reject,
whether designedly or inadvertently, what had been ordained by the
Council of Sardica in favour of Rome.  But as assuredly it did not
affect to prevent either Ecumenical Councils, or even general Councils
of the East, from judging of matters brought before them, so I do not
know if one may conclude absolutely that they intended to forbid appeals
to Rome.  It regulates proceedings between Dioceses, but not what might
concern superior tribunals.

<span id="ix.viii.iii-p15"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.viii.iii-p15.1"></span>Fleury.</span>

<span id="ix.viii.iii-p16"></span>(*Hist. Eccl. in loc*.).

<span id="ix.viii.iii-p17"></span>This Canon, which gives to the
councils of particular places full authority in Ecclesiastical matters,
seems to take away the power of appealing to the Pope granted by the
Council of Sardica, and to restore the ancient right.

<span id="ix.viii.iii-p18"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.viii.iii-p18.1"></span>Hefele.</span>

<span id="ix.viii.iii-p19"></span>An exception to the rule against
interference in other patriarchates was made with regard to those
Churches newly founded amongst barbarous nations (not belonging to the
Roman Empire), as these were of course obliged to receive their first
bishops from strange patriarchates, and remained afterwards too few in
number to form patriarchates of their own and were therefore governed as
belonging to other patriarchates, as, for instance, Abyssinia by the
patriarchate of Alexandria.
