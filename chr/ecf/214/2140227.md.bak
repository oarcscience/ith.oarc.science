<span id="viii.vii.iii.lxi-p5"></span>A presbyter shall not enter the
bema before the bishop, nor sit down.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.lxi-p6"></span>It is difficult to translate this
canon without giving a false idea of its meaning.  It does not determine
the order of dignity in an ecclesiastical procession, but something
entirely different, viz., it provides that when the bishop enters the
sanctuary he should not be alone and walk into a place already occupied,
but that he should have with him, as a guard <span id="page_158">p.
158</span> <span id="viii.vii.iii.lxi-Page_158"></span>of honour, the
clergy.  Whether these should walk before or after him would be a mere
matter of local custom, the rule *juniores priores* did not universally
prevail.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.lxi-p7"></span>This canon is found in the *Corpus
Juris Canonici*, Gratian’s *Decretum*, Pars I., Dist. XCV., can. viij.
