id="vii.iii-Page_3"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="vii.iii-p1.1"></span>The Nicene Creed.</span>

<span id="vii.iii-p2"></span>*(Found in the Acts of the Ecumenical
Councils of Ephesus and Chalcedon, in the Epistle of Eusebius of Cæsarea
to his own Church, in the Epistle of St. Athanasius* Ad Jovianum Imp*.,
in the Ecclesiastical Histories of Theodoret and Socrates, and
elsewhere, The variations in the text are absolutely without
importance.)*

<span id="vii.iii-p3"></span>The Synod at Nice set forth this
Creed. <span id="fr_48"></span>[49](#fn_48.md)

<span id="vii.iii-p5"></span>The Ecthesis of the Synod at Nice. <span
id="fr_49"></span>[50](#fn_49.md)

<span id="vii.iii-p7"></span>We believe in one God, the Father Almighty,
maker of all things visible and invisible; and in one Lord Jesus Christ,
the Son of God, the only-begotten of his Father, of the substance of the
Father, God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God, begotten
(<span class="Greek"><span id="vii.iii-p7.1"></span>γεννηθέντα</span>),
not made, being of one substance (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.iii-p7.2"></span>ὁμοούσιον</span>, consubstantialem) with the
Father.  By whom all things were made, both which be in heaven and in
earth.  Who for us men and for our salvation came down \[from heaven\]
and was incarnate and was made man.  He suffered and the third day he
rose again, and ascended into heaven.  And he shall come again to judge
both the quick and the dead.  And \[we believe\] in the Holy Ghost.  And
whosoever shall say that there was a time when the Son of God was not
(<span class="Greek"><span id="vii.iii-p7.3"></span>ἤν ποτε ὅτε οὐκ
ἦν</span>), or that before he was begotten he was not, or that he was
made of things that were not, or that he is of a different substance or
essence \[from the Father\] or that he is a creature, or subject to
change or conversion <span id="fr_50"></span>[51](#fn_50.md) —all that so
say, the Catholic and Apostolic Church anathematizes them.

<span id="vii.iii-p9"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="vii.iii-p9.1"></span>Notes.</span>

<span id="vii.iii-p10"></span>The Creed of Eusebius of Cæsarea, which he
presented to the council, and which some suppose to have suggested the
creed finally adopted.

<span id="vii.iii-p11"></span>(*Found in his Epistle to his diocese;
vide:  St. Athanasius and Theodoret.*)

<span id="vii.iii-p12"></span>We believe in one only God, Father
Almighty, Creator of things visible and invisible; and in the Lord Jesus
Christ, for he is the Word of God, God of God, Light of Light, life of
life, his only Son, the first-born of all creatures, begotten of the
Father before all time, by whom also everything was created, who became
flesh for our redemption, who lived and suffered amongst men, rose again
the third day, returned to the Father, and will come again one day in
his glory to judge the quick and the dead.  We believe also in the Holy
Ghost.  We believe that each of these three is and subsists; the Father
truly as Father, the Son truly as Son, the Holy Ghost truly as Holy
Ghost; as our Lord also said, when he sent his disciples to preach:  Go
and teach all nations, and baptize them in the name of the Father, and
of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.
