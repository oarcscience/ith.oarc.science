<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.cxvi-p1.1"></span>Canon CXV.  (Greek cxvi.)</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxvi-p2"></span>That in the Lord’s Prayer the Saints
say for themselves:  “Forgive us our trespasses.”

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxvi-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.cxvi-p3.1"></span>It</span> has seemed good that whoever
should say that when in the Lord’s prayer, the saints say, “forgive us
our trespasses,” they say this not for themselves, because they have no
need of this petition, but for the rest who are sinners of the people;
and that <span id="page_499">p. 499</span> <span
id="xv.iv.iv.cxvi-Page_499"></span>therefore no one of the saints can
say, “Forgive me my trespasses,” but “Forgive us our trespasses;” so
that the just is understood to seek this for others rather than for
himself; let him be anathema.  For holy and just was the Apostle James,
when he said, “For in many things we offend all.”  For why was it added
“all,” unless that this sentence might agree also with the psalm, where
we read, “Enter not into judgment with thy servant, O Lord, for in thy
sight shall no man living be justified;” and in the prayer of the most
wise Solomon:  “There is no man that sinneth not;” and in the book of
the holy Job:  “He sealeth in the hand of every man, that every man may
know his own infirmity;” wherefore even the holy and just Daniel when in
prayer said several times:  “We have sinned, we have done iniquity,” and
other things which there truly and humbly he confessed; nor let it be
thought (as some have thought) that this was said not of his own but
rather of the people’s sins, for he said further on:  “When I shall pray
and confess my sins and the sins of my people to the Lord my God;” he
did not wish to say our sins, but he said the sins of his people and his
own sins, since he as a prophet foresaw that those who were to come
would thus misunderstand his words.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxvi-p5"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.cxvi-p5.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon CXV.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxvi-p6"></span>Whoso expounds this, “forgive us our
trespasses” as speaking only of the multitude and not of individuals let
him be anathema:  Since Daniel even he can behold saying with the
multitude “I confessed my sins and the sins of my people.”

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxvi-p7"></span>This is Canon vij. of Carthage, <span
