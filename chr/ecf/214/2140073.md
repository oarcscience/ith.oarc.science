have offered sacrifice before their baptism, and were afterwards
baptized, may be promoted to orders, inasmuch as they have been
cleansed.

id="viii.iii.iii.xii-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XII.</span>

<span id="viii.iii.iii.xii-p5"></span>Whoso has sacrificed before his
baptism, after it shall be guiltless.

<span id="viii.iii.iii.xii-p6"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.xii-p6.1"></span>Hefele.</span>

<span id="viii.iii.iii.xii-p7"></span>This canon does not speak
generally of all those who sacrificed before baptism; for if a heathen
sacrificed before having embraced Christianity, he certainly could not
be reproached for it after his admission.  It was quite a different case
with a catechumen, who had already declared for Christianity, but who,
during the persecution had lost courage, and sacrificed.  In this case
it might be asked whether he could still be admitted to the priesthood. 
The Council decided that a baptized catechumen could afterwards be
promoted to holy orders.
