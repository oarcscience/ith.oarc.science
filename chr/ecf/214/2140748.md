<span id="xvii.xxviii-p2"></span>Theophilus was informed, that the
priest in Geminus, a village, had repelled Kyradium (a woman) from the
communion:  Theophilus approves of it, because she had done wrong, and
was unwilling to make satisfaction; but orders her to be admitted to
communion upon repentance.
