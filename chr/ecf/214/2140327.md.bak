<span id="xi.xviii.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xi.xviii.ix-p1.1"></span>Canon IX.</span>

<span id="xi.xviii.ix-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xi.xviii.ix-p2.1"></span>If</span> any Clergyman have a matter
against another clergyman, he shall not forsake his bishop and run to
secular courts; but let him first lay open the matter before his own
Bishop, or let the matter be submitted to any person whom each of the
parties may, with the Bishop’s consent, select.  And if any one shall
contravene these decrees, let him be subjected to canonical penalties. 
And if a clergyman have a complaint against his own or any other bishop,
let it be decided by the synod of the province.  And if a bishop or
clergyman should have a difference with the metropolitan of the
province, let him have recourse to the Exarch of the Diocese, or to the
throne of the Imperial City of Constantinople, and there let it be
tried.

<span id="xi.xviii.ix-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xi.xviii.ix-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon IX.</span>

<span id="xi.xviii.ix-p5"></span>Litigious clerics shall be punished
according to canon, if they despise the episcopal and resort to the
secular tribunal.  When a cleric has a contention with a bishop let him
wait till the synod sits, and if a bishop have a contention with his
metropolitan let him carry the case to Constantinople.

<span id="xi.xviii.ix-p7"></span>Let the reader observe that here is a
greater privilege given by a General Council to the see of
Constantinople than ever was given by any council, even that of Sardica,
to the bishop of Rome, viz., that any bishop or clergyman might at the
first instance bring his cause before the bishop of Constantinople if
the defendant were a metropolitan.

<span id="xi.xviii.ix-p9"></span>That our canon would refer not merely
the ecclesiastical, but the civil differences of the clergy, in the
first case, to the bishop, is beyond a doubt.  And it comes out as
clearly from the word <span class="Greek"><span
id="xi.xviii.ix-p9.1"></span>πρότερον</span> (= at first) that it does
not absolutely exclude a reference to the secular judges, but regards it
as allowable only when the first attempt at an adjustment of the
controversy by the bishop has miscarried.  This was quite clearly
recognized by Justinian in his 123d Novel, c. 21:  “If any one has a
case against a cleric, or a monk, or a deaconess, or a nun, or an
ascetic, he shall first make application to the bishop of his opponent,
and he shall decide.  If both parties are satisfied with his decision,
it shall then be carried into effect by the imperial judge of the
locality.  If, however, one of the contending parties lodges an appeal
against the bishop’s judgment within ten days, then the imperial judge
of the locality shall decide the matter.  There is no doubt that the
expression “Exarch” employed in our canon, and also in canon 17, means,
in the first place, those superior metropolitans who have several
ecclesiastical provinces under them.  Whether, however, the great
patriarchs, properly so called, are to be included under it, may be
doubted.  The Emperor Justinian, in c. 22 of his Novel just quoted (*l.
c*.) in our text has, without further explanation, substituted the
expression *Patriarch* for *Exarch*, and in the same way the commentator
Aristenus has declared both terms to be identical, adding that only the
Patriarch of Constantinople has the privilege of having a metropolitan
tried before him who does not belong to his patriarchate, but is subject
to another patriarch.  In the same way our canon was understood by
Beveridge.  Van Espen, on the contrary, thinks that the Synod had here
in view only the exarchs in the narrower sense (of Ephesus, Cæsarea),
but not the Patriarchs, properly so called, of Rome, Alexandria,
Antioch, and Jerusalem, as it would be too great a violation of the
ancient canons, particularly of the 6th of Nicæa, to have set aside the
proper patriarch and have allowed an appeal to the Bishop of
Constantinople (with this Zonaras also agrees in his explanation of
canon 17).  Least of all, however, would the Synod have made such a rule
for the West, i.e., have allowed that any one should set aside the
Patriarch of <span id="page_275">p. 275</span> <span
id="xi.xviii.ix-Page_275"></span>Rome and appeal to the Patriarch of
Constantinople, since they themselves, in canon 28, assigned the first
place in rank to Rome.

<span id="xi.xviii.ix-p10"></span>It appears to me that neither
Beveridge, etc., nor Van Espen are fully in the right, while each is
partially so.  With Van Espen we must assume that our Synod, in drawing
up this canon, had in view only the Greek Church, and not the Latin as
well, particularly as neither the papal legates nor any Latin bishop
whatever was present at the drawing up of these canons.  On the other
hand, Beveridge is also right in maintaining that the Synod made no
distinction between the patriarchs proper and the exarchs (such a
distinction must otherwise have been indicated in the text), and allowed
that quarrels which should arise among the bishops of other
patriarchates might be tried at Constantinople.  Only that Beveridge
ought to have excepted the West and Rome.

<span id="xi.xviii.ix-p11"></span>The strange part of our canon may be
explained in the following manner.  There were always many bishops at
Constantinople from the most different places, who came there to lay
their contentions and the like before the Emperor.  The latter
frequently referred the decision to the bishop of Constantinople, who
then, in union with the then present bishops from the most different
provinces, held a “Home Synod” and gave the sentence required at this. 
Thus gradually the practice was formed of controversies being decided by
bishops of other patriarchates or exarchates at Constantinople, to the
setting aside of the proper superior metropolitan, an example of which
we have seen in that famous Synod of Constantinople, <span
class="sc"><span id="xi.xviii.ix-p11.1"></span>a.d.</span> 448, at which
the case of Eutyches was the first time brought forward.

<span id="xi.xviii.ix-p12"></span>This canon is found in the *Corpus
Juris Canonici*, Gratian’s *Decretum*, Pars II., Causa XI., Q.I., canon
xlvj.
