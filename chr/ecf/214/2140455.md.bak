<span id="xiv.iii.lxxii-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xiv.iii.lxxii-p1.1"></span>Canon LXXI.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.lxxii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.lxxii-p2.1"></span>Those</span> who are taught the civil
laws must not adopt the customs of the Gentiles, nor be induced to go to
the theatre, nor to keep what are called *Cylestras*, nor to wear
clothing contrary to the general custom; and this holds good when they
begin their training, when they reach its end, and, in short, all the
time of its duration.  If any one from this time shall dare to do
contrary to this canon he is to be cut off.

<span id="xiv.iii.lxxii-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.lxxii-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon LXXI.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.lxxii-p5"></span>Whoever devotes himself to the study
of law, uses the manner of the Gentiles, going to the theatre, and
rolling in the dust, or dressing differently to custom, shall be cut
off.

<span id="xiv.iii.lxxii-p6"></span>Liddell and Scott identify <span
class="Greek"><span id="xiv.iii.lxxii-p6.1"></span>καλίστρα</span> with
<span class="Greek"><span
id="xiv.iii.lxxii-p6.2"></span>καλινδήθρα</span> ,which they define as
“a place for horses to roll after exercise,” and note that it is a
synonym of <span class="Greek"><span
id="xiv.iii.lxxii-p6.3"></span>ἀλινδήθρα</span>.  But it is interesting
to note that <span class="Greek"><span
id="xiv.iii.lxxii-p6.4"></span>ἀλίνησις</span> is “a rolling in the
dust, an exercise in which wrestlers rolled on the ground.”

<span id="xiv.iii.lxxii-p7"></span>Hefele says that Balsamon and Zonaras
have not been able rightly to explain what we are to understand by the
forbidden “Cylestras,” but I think Johnson is not far out of the way
when he translates “nor to meddle with athletic exercises.”
