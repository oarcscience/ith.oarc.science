id="xv.iv.iv.lxxix-p1.1"></span>Canon LXXVIII.  (Greek lxxxi.)</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxxix-p2"></span>Of the Church of Hippo-Diarrhytus.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxxix-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.lxxix-p3.1"></span>It</span> further seemed good that since
the destitution of the Church of Hippo-Diarrhytus should no longer be
neglected, and the churches there are retained by those who have
declined the infamous communion of Equitius, that certain bishops be
sent from the present council, viz.:  Reginus, Alypius, Augustine,
Maternus, Theasius, Evodius, Placian, Urban, Valerius, Ambivius,
Fortunatus, Quodvultdeus, Honoratus, Januarius, Aptus, Honoratus,
Ampelius, Victorian, Evangelus and Rogation; and when those had been
gathered together, and those had been corrected who with culpable
pertinacity were of opinion that this flight of the same Equitius should
be waited for, let a bishop be ordained for them by the vote of all. 
But if these should not be willing to consider peace, let them not
prevent the choosing for ordination of a bishop, for the advantage of
the church which has been so long destitute.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxxix-p5"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.lxxix-p5.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon LXXVIII.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxxix-p6"></span>It seemed good that, after Equitius
had been condemned by the universal vote, a bishop of Hippo should be
elected, and that they should in no way impede the ordination of a
prelate for that church.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxxix-Page_481"></span>This canon was likewise
probably an appendix, to Canon xiij, of the Synod of Carthage of
September 13th, 401, according to Hefele.

consecration seems to be the vacant see.
