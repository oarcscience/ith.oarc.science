id="xiv.iii.xci-p1.1"></span>Canon XC.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.xci-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.xci-p2.1"></span>We</span> have received from our divine
Fathers the canon law that in honour of Christ’s resurrection, we are
not to kneel on Sundays.  Lest therefore we should ignore the fulness of
this observance we make it plain to the faithful that after the priests
have gone to the Altar for Vespers on Saturdays (according to the
prevailing custom) no one shall kneel in prayer until the evening of
Sunday, at which time after the entrance for compline, again with bended
knees we offer our prayers to the Lord.  For taking the night after the
Sabbath, which was the forerunner of our Lord’s resurrection, we begin
from it to sing in the spirit hymns to God, leading our feast out of
darkness into light, and thus during an entire day and night, we
celebrate the Resurrection.

<span id="xiv.iii.xci-p7"></span>No doubt the synod by the words “we
have received from the divine Fathers,” referred to canon xx. of the
Council of Nice.

<span id="xiv.iii.xci-p8"></span><span id="page_404">p. 404</span> <span
id="xiv.iii.xci-Page_404"></span>For many centuries this custom was
preserved even in the Latin Church; and the custom of keeping feasts and
whole days generally from evening to evening is believed to have been an
Apostolic tradition, received by them from the Jews.  At the end of the
<span class="sc"><span id="xiv.iii.xci-p8.1"></span>VIII</span>th
Century the Synod of Frankfort declared in its xxj. canon, that “the
Lord’s day should be kept from evening to evening.” <span
