<span id="viii.v.iv.iii-p7"></span>This canon is framed in accordance
with the doctrine of the Apostle, in [1 Tim.
6.1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#001.md)<span
id="viii.v.iv.iii-p7.1"></span>.  “Let as many servants as are under the
yoke count their own masters worthy of all honour, that the name of God
and his doctrine be not blasphemed.”  And again the same Apostle teaches
his disciple Titus that he should “exhort servants to be obedient unto
their own masters, and to please them well in all things; not answering
again; not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may
adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.” ([Titus
2.9-10](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#009.md)<span
id="viii.v.iv.iii-p7.2"></span>.)

<span id="viii.v.iv.iii-p8"></span>These texts are likewise cited by
Balsamon and Zonaras.

<span id="viii.v.iv.iii-p9"></span>This Canon is found in the *Corpus
Juris Canonici*, Gratian’s *Decretum*, Pars. II., Causa XVII., Q. IV.,
c. xxxvij. in the version of Isidore, and again in c. xxxviij. from the
collections of Martin Bracarensis (so says Van Espen) and assigned to a
council of Pope Martin, Canon xlvii.
