<span id="xv.iv.iv.xxix-Page_456"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xxix-p1.1"></span>Canon XXVIII.  (Greek xxxi.)</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xxix-p2"></span>*Presbyters, deacons, or clerics, who
shall think good to carry appeals in their causes across the water shall
not at all be admitted to communion.* <span

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xxix-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xxix-p4.1"></span>It</span> also seemed good that
presbyters, deacons, and others of the inferior clergy in the causes
which they had, if they were dissatisfied with the judgments of their
bishops, let the neighbouring bishops with the consent of their own
bishop hear them, and let the bishops who have been called in judge
between them:  but if they think they have cause of appeal from these,
they shall not betake themselves to judgments from beyond seas, but to
the primates of their own provinces, or else to an universal council, as
has also been decreed concerning bishops.  But whoso shall think good to
carry an appeal across the water shall be received to communion by no
one within the boundaries of Africa.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xxix-p6"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xxix-p6.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XXVIII.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xxix-p7"></span>Clerics who have been condemned, if
they take exception to the judgment, shall not appeal beyond seas, but
to the neighbouring bishops, and to their own; if they do otherwise let
them be excommunicated in Africa.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xxix-p8"></span>This canon is the same as Canon xvij.
of the Synod of Carthage of 418, but it has some words with regard to
appeals which that canon does not contain, viz.:  “*Aut ad universale
conciliam, sicut et de episcopis sæpe constitutum est*.”  This clause,
affirming that bishops have often been forbidden to appeal across the
water from the decisions of the African bishops, has caused great
perplexity as no such decrees are extant.  The Ballerini, to avoid this
difficulty, and possibly for other reasons, suggest an entirely
different meaning to the passage, and suppose that it means that
“bishops have often been allowed to appeal to the Universal Council and
now this privilege is extended to priests.” <span
id="fr_430"></span>[431](#fn_430)   But this would seem to be a rather
unnatural interpretation and Van Espen in his Commentary shews good
reason for adopting the more evident view.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xxix-p12"></span>Clearly the See of Rome is here
aimed at, as if Carthage were the place designed by Providence to put a
stop to the growth of power in Christian Rome, as well as heathen.  It
is strange, that this canon should be received by the Church of Rome in
former ages.
