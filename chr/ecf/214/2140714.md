<span id="xvi.xviii.ii-p1"></span> II.  *Authority of the Caroline
Books*.

<span id="xvi.xviii.ii-p2"></span>But be their authorship what it may,
we come next to consider their authority; and here we are met with the
greatest difficulty, for it is certain that despite the statements to
the contrary, these books were not those sent to Pope Hadrian by
Charlemagne, those of which the Pope deigned to write a refutation. 
This Hefele has clearly proved, by pointing out that those sent to the
Pope treated the matter in an entirely different order; that there were
in those sent only 85 chapters, while these books have 120 (or 121 if
the authenticity of the last chapter is granted).  Moreover the
quotations made by Hadrian do not occur *verbatim* in the Caroline
books, but are in some cases enlarged, in others abbreviated.  (Cf.
Hefele’s treatment of the whole subject in the original German.) 
Petavius thinks that what Hadrian received were extracts from the
Caroline Books, made by the Council of Frankfort.

<span id="xvi.xviii.ii-p3"></span><span id="page_579">p. 579</span>
<span id="xvi.xviii.ii-Page_579"></span>Hefele arrives at a directly
opposite conclusion, viz., that the Caroline Books are an expansion of
the *Capitula* sent to the Pope, and that this expansion was made at the
bidding of Charlemagne.

<span id="xvi.xviii.ii-p4"></span>It should be noted here that Baronius,
Bellarmine, Binius, and Surius all question the authenticity of the
Caroline Books altogether.  (*Vide* Baron, *Annal*., <span
class="sc"><span id="xvi.xviii.ii-p4.1"></span>a.d.</span>, 794.)  But
this extreme position seems to be refuted by the fact that certain
quotations made by Hincmar are found in the books as we have them. 
(*Cf*. Sirmond in Mansi, Tom. XIII., 905, Labbe, Tom. VII., col. 1054.)
