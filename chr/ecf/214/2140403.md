<span id="xiv.iii.xx-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xiv.iii.xx-p1.1"></span>Canon XIX.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.xx-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.xx-p2.1"></span>It</span> behoves those who preside over the
churches, every day but especially on Lord’s days, to teach all the
clergy and people words of piety and of right religion, gathering out of
holy Scripture meditations and determinations of the truth, and not
going beyond the limits now fixed, nor varying from the tradition of the
God-bearing fathers.  And if any controversy in regard to Scripture
shall have been raised, let them not interpret it otherwise than as the
lights and doctors of the church in their writings have expounded it,
and in those let them glory rather than in composing things out of their
own heads, lest through their lack of skill <span
id="fr_364"></span>[365](#fn_364.md) they may have departed from what was
fitting.  For <span id="page_375">p. 375</span> <span
id="xiv.iii.xx-Page_375"></span>through the doctrine of the aforesaid
fathers, the people coming to the knowledge of what is good and
desirable, as well as what is useless and to be rejected, will remodel
their life for the better, and not be led by ignorance, but applying
their minds to the doctrine, they will take heed that no evil befall
them and work out their salvation in fear of impending punishment.

<span id="xiv.iii.xx-p5"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.xx-p5.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XIX.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.xx-p6"></span>The prelates of the Church, especially
upon Lord’s days, shall teach doctrine.

<span id="xiv.iii.xx-p7"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.xx-p7.1"></span>Van Espen.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.xx-p8"></span>How great an obligation of preaching
rests upon bishops, the successors of the Apostles, is evident from the
words of St. Paul, “Christ sent me not to baptize but to preach” ([1
Cor. i. 17](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#017.md)<span
id="xiv.iii.xx-p8.1"></span>), and his chief adjuration to Timothy
though Jesus Christ and his coming, was “Preach the Word” ([2 Tim. ii.
4](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#004.md)<span
id="xiv.iii.xx-p8.2"></span>.).  For this reason the fathers formerly
called the episcopate the preaching-office (*officium predicationis*),
as is evident from the profession of Adelbert Morinensis, and the form
of profession of a future Archbishop.  Both of these will be found in
Labbe, appendix to Tom. VIII., of his *Concilia*.

<span id="xiv.iii.xx-p10"></span>(*Sess*. V., c. 2.)

<span id="xiv.iii.xx-p11"></span>The preaching of the Gospel is the
chief work of bishops.

<span id="xiv.iii.xx-p12"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.xx-p12.1"></span>Convocation of Canterbury, a.d.
1571.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.xx-p13"></span>(Cardwell.  *Synodalia*, Vol. I., p.
126.)

<span id="xiv.iii.xx-p14"></span>The clergy will be careful to teach
nothing in their sermons to be religiously held and believed by the
people except what is agreeable to the doctrine of the Old and New
Testament, and what the Catholic Fathers and Ancient Bishops have
collected out of the same. <span id="fr_365"></span>[366](#fn_365.md)

<span id="xiv.iii.xx-p16"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.xx-p16.1"></span>Council of Trent.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.xx-p17"></span>(*Sess*. IV.)

<span id="xiv.iii.xx-p18"></span>No one shall dare to interpret the Holy
Scripture contrary to the unanimous consent of the fathers.
