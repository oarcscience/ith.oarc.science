<span id="xvi.xiv.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xvi.xiv.xiv-p1.1"></span>Canon XIV.</span>

<span id="xvi.xiv.xiv-p2"></span>That no one without ordination ought to
read in the ambo during the synaxis.

<span id="xvi.xiv.xiv-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xvi.xiv.xiv-p3.1"></span>That</span> there is a certain order
established in the priesthood is very evident to all, and to guard
diligently the promotions of the priesthood is well pleasing to God. 
Since therefore we see certain youths who have received the clerical
tonsure, but who have not yet received ordination from the bishop,
reading in the ambo during the Synaxis, and in doing this violating the
canons, we forbid this to be done (from henceforth,) and let this
prohibition be observed also amongst the monks.  It is permitted to each
hegumenos in his own monastery to ordain a reader, if he himself had
received the laying on of hands by a bishop to the dignity of hegumenos,
and is known to be a presbyter.  Chorepiscopi may likewise, according to
ancient custom and with the bishop’s authorization, appoint
readers. <span id="fr_540"></span>[541](#fn_540.md)

<span id="xvi.xiv.xiv-p6"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xvi.xiv.xiv-p6.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XIV.</span>

<span id="xvi.xiv.xiv-p7"></span>No one shall read from the ambon unless
he has been ordained by the bishop.  And this shall be in force also
among monks.  The superior of a monastery, if he has been ordained by
the bishop, may ordain a lector but only in his own monastery.  A
chorepiscopus also can make a lector.

<span id="xvi.xiv.xiv-p9"></span>I say therefore from this present canon
and from canon xix. that they may properly be made superiors, who have
never received holy orders; since women may be placed in such positions
in our monasteries.  And as these women do not hear confessions, nor
make readers, so neither do superiors do this who are neither monks nor
priests, nor could they

<span id="xvi.xiv.xiv-p11"></span>Van Espen (l. c. p. 469 sqq., and *Jus
Canon*., t. i. pt. xxxi. tit. 31, c. 6), professes to show (a) that at
that time there was no special benediction of abbots (different from
their ordination as priests), and that therefore the words, “if he (the
superior of the monastery) himself is consecrated by the bishop to the
office of hegumenus,” and “evidently is a priest,” mean the same; (b)
that at the time of our Synod every superior of a monastery, a prior as
well as an abbot, had the power of conferring upon the monks of his
monastery the order of lector; but (c) that the way in which Anastasius
translated the canon (*si dumtaxat Abbati manus impositio facta noscatur
ab episcopo secundum morem præficiendorum abbatum*), and the reception
of this translation into the *Corpus juris canonici*, c.l., Dist. lxix.,
gave occasion to concede the right in question, of ordaining lectors,
only to the solemnly consecrated (and insulated) abbots.

<span id="xvi.xiv.xiv-p12"></span>This canon is found (as just noted) in
the *Corpus Juris Canonici*, Pars I., Dist. LXIX, c.j.
