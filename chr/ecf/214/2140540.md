<span id="xv.iv.iv.xvii-Page_450"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xvii-p1.1"></span>Canon XVI.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xvii-p2"></span>That no bishop, presbyter or deacon
should be a “conductor;” and that Readers should take wives; and that
the clergy should abstain from usury; and at what age they or virgins
should be consecrated.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xvii-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xvii-p3.1"></span>Likewise</span> it seemed good that
bishops, presbyters, and deacons should not be “conductors” or
“procurators;” nor seek their food by any base and vile business, for
they should remember how it is written, “No man fighting for God
cumbereth himself with worldly affairs.”

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xvii-p4"></span>Also it seemed good that Readers when
they come to years of puberty, should be compelled either to take wives
or else to profess continence.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xvii-p5"></span>Likewise it seemed good that if a
clergyman had lent money he should get it back again, but if kind
(*speciem*) he should receive back the same kind as he gave.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xvii-p6"></span>And that younger than twenty-five
years deacons should not be ordained, nor virgins consecrated.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xvii-p7"></span>And that readers should not salute
the people.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xvii-p8"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xvii-p8.1"></span>Notes.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xvii-p9"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xvii-p9.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of XVI.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xvii-p10"></span>A bishop, presbyter, and deacon may
not be a “conductor” or a “procurator.”  A reader when he comes to
puberty must contract marriage or profess continence.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xvii-p11"></span>A cleric who has lent to someone,
what he gave let him receive, or as much.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xvii-p12"></span>Let not him be a deacon, who is made
a deacon being under twenty-five.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xvii-p13"></span>And let not readers salute the
people.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xvii-p14"></span>This canon is made up of Canons xv.,
xviij., and xxj., and added to these Canon j. of the same Second Series
of the synod of Hippo, <span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xvii-p14.1"></span>a.d.</span> 393.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xvii-p16"></span>Zonaras says this was never observed
anywhere but in Africa.  See Can. Afr. 19 (27).

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xvii-p17"></span>Du Pin turns the Latin, *saluto*, by
“addressing his speech to the people.”
