<span id="xvii.xxi-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.xxi-p2.1"></span>The Canonical Epistle of St. Gregory, Bishop
of Nyssa, to St. Letoïus, Bishop of Melitene. <span
id="fr_599"></span>[600](#fn_599.md) </span>

<span id="xvii.xxi-p4"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.xxi-p4.1"></span>Canon I.</span>

<span id="xvii.xxi-p5"></span>At Easter not only they who are
transformed by the grace of the laver, i.e. baptism, but they who are
penitents and converts, are to be brought to God, i.e. to the
Communion:  for Easter is that Catholic feast in which there is a
resurrection from the fall of sin.

<span id="xvii.xxi-p6"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.xxi-p6.1"></span>Canon II.</span>

<span id="xvii.xxi-p7"></span>They who lapse without any force, so as to
deny Christ, or do by choice turn Jews, idolaters, or Manichees, or
infidels of any sort, not to be admitted to communion till the hour of
death; and if they chance to recover beyond expectation, to return to
their penance.  But they who were forced by torments, to do the penance
of fornication.

<span id="xvii.xxi-p8"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.xxi-p8.1"></span>Canon III.</span>

<span id="xvii.xxi-p9"></span>If they who run to conjurers or diviners,
do it through unbelief, they shall be treated as they who wilfully
lapse, but if through want of sense, and through a vain hope of being
relieved under their necessities, they shall be treated as those who
lapse through the violence of torment.

<span id="xvii.xxi-p10"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.xxi-p10.1"></span>Canon IV.</span>

<span id="xvii.xxi-p11"></span>That fornicators be three years wholly
ejected from prayer, three years hearers, three years prostrators, and
then admitted to communion; but the time of hearing and prostrating may
be lessened to them who of their own accord confess, and are earnest
penitents.  That this time be doubled in case of adultery, and unlawful
lusts, but discretion to be used.

<span id="xvii.xxi-p12"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.xxi-p12.1"></span>Canon V.</span>

<span id="xvii.xxi-p13"></span>Voluntary murderers shall be nine years
ejected out of the church, nine years hearers, nine years prostrators;
but every one of these nine years may be reduced to seven or six, or
even five, if the penitents be very diligent.  Involuntary murderers to
be treated as fornicators, but still with discretion, and allowing the
communion on a death-bed, but on condition, that they return to penance
if they survive.

<span id="xvii.xxi-p14"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.xxi-p14.1"></span>Canon VI.</span>

<span id="xvii.xxi-p15"></span>That the Fathers have been too gentle
toward the idolatry of covetous persons, in condemning to penance only
robbery, digging of graves, and sacrilege, whereas usury and oppression,
though under colour of contract, are forbidden by Scripture.  That
highwaymen returning to the Church, be treated as murderers.  They that
pilfer, and then confess their sin to the priest, are only obliged to
amendment, and to be liberal to the poor; and if they have nothing, to
labour and give their earnings.

<span id="xvii.xxi-p16"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.xxi-p16.1"></span>Canon VII.</span>

<span id="xvii.xxi-p17"></span>They who dig into graves, and rake into
the ashes and bones of the dead, in order to find some valuable thing
buried together with the corpse, (not they who only take some stones
belonging to a sepulchre, in order to use them in building) to do the
penance of fornicators.

<span id="xvii.xxi-p18"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.xxi-p18.1"></span>Canon VIII.</span>

<span id="xvii.xxi-p19"></span>He observes that by the law of Moses,
sacrilege was punished as murder, and that the guilty person was stoned
to death, and thinks the Fathers too gentle, in imposing a shorter
penance on sacrilege than adultery.
