<span id="xv.iv.iv.viii-p2"></span>Concerning those who are reconciled
in peril of death.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.viii-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.viii-p3.1"></span>Aurelius</span> the bishop said:  If
anyone had fallen into peril of death during the absence of the bishop,
and had sought to reconcile himself to the divine altars, the presbyter
should consult the bishop, and so reconcile the sick man at his bidding,
which thing we should strengthen with healthy counsel.  By all the
bishops it was said:  Whatever your holiness has taught us to be
necessary, that is our pleasure.
