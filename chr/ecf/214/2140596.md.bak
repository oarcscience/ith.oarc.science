<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.lxxiii-p1.1"></span>Canon LXXII.  (Greek lxxv.)</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxxiii-p2"></span>Of the baptism of infants when
there is some doubt of their being already baptized.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxxiii-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.lxxiii-p3.1"></span>Item</span>, it seemed good that
whenever there were not found reliable witnesses who could testify that
without any doubt they were baptized and when the children themselves
were not, on account of their tender age, able to answer concerning the
giving of the sacraments to them, all such children should be baptized
without scruple, lest a hesitation should deprive them of the cleansing
of the sacraments.  This was urged by the Moorish Legates, our brethren,
since they redeem many such from the barbarians.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxxiii-p6"></span>It seemed good that they should be
baptized about whom there was an ambiguity whether they had been
baptized or no; lest they might through that doubt lose the divine
ablution.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxxiii-p7"></span>This is Canon vij. of Carthage,
September, <span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.lxxiii-p7.1"></span>a.d.</span> 401.
