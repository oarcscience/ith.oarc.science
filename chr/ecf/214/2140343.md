<span id="xi.xviii.xxv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xi.xviii.xxv-p2.1"></span>Forasmuch</span> as certain of the
metropolitans, as we have heard, neglect the flocks committed to them,
and delay the ordinations of bishops the holy Synod has decided that the
ordinations of bishops shall take place within three months, unless an
inevitable necessity should some time require the term of delay to be
prolonged.  And if he shall not do this, he shall be liable to
ecclesiastical penalties, and the income of the widowed church shall be
kept safe by the steward of the same Church.

id="xi.xviii.xxv-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XXV.</span>

<span id="xi.xviii.xxv-p5"></span>Let the ordination of bishops be
within three months:  necessity however may make the time longer.  But
if anyone shall ordain counter to this decree, he shall be liable to
punishment.  The revenue shall remain with the œconomus.

<span id="xi.xviii.xxv-p7"></span>The “Steward of the Church” was to
“take care of the revenues of the church widowed” by the death of its
bishop, who was regarded as representing Him to whom the whole Church
was espoused (see [Eph. v. 23](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#023)<span
id="xi.xviii.xxv-p7.1"></span> ff.).  So in the “order of the holy and
great church” of St. Sophia, the “Great Steward” is described as “taking
the oversight of the widowed church” (Goar, *Eucholog*., p. 269); so
Hincmar says:  “Si fuerit defunctus episcopus, ego…visitatorem ipsi
viduatæ designabo ecclesiæ; “and the phrase, “viduata per mortem N.
nuper episcopi” became common in the West (F. G. Lee, *Validity of
English Orders*, p. 373).  The episcopal ring was a symbol of the same
idea.  So at St. Chrysostom’s restoration Eudoxia claimed to have “given
back the bridegroom” (*Serm. post redit*., iv.).  So Bishop Wilson told
Queen Caroline that he “would not leave his wife in his old age because
she was poor” (Keble’s *Life of Wilson*, ii., 767); and Peter Mongus,
having invaded the Alexandrian see while its legitimate occupant,
Timothy Salophaciolus, was alive, was expelled as an “adulterer”
(Liberatus, *Breviar*., xviij.).
