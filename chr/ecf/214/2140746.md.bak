id="xvii.xxvi-Page_614"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.xxvi-p1.1"></span>The Commonitory of the Same which Ammon
Received on Account of Lycus.</span>

<span id="xvii.xxvi-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.xxvi-p2.1"></span>Canon II.</span>

<span id="xvii.xxvi-p3"></span>Let \[the priests\] who have communicated
with the Arians, be retained or rejected, as the custom of every church
is; but so, that other orthodox \[priests\] be ordained, though the
others continue.  As the orthodox bishops did in Thebais, so let it be
in other cities.  They who were ordained by Bishop Apollo, and
afterwards communicated with the Arians, if they did it of their own
accord, let them be censured; but if they only did it in obedience to
the bishop, let them be continued; but if all the people abdicate them,
others must be ordained.  And if Bistus the priest be found to have
committed uncleanness with a woman dismissed from her husband, let him
not be permitted to be a priest.  But this is no prejudice to the bishop
who ordained him, if he did it ignorantly; since the Holy Synod commands
unworthy men to be ejected, though they be not convicted until after
ordination.

<span id="xvii.xxvi-p4"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.xxvi-p4.1"></span>Canon III.</span>

<span id="xvii.xxvi-p5"></span>Let Bishop Apollo’s sentence against his
priest Sur prevail, though he has the liberty of being further heard.

<span id="xvii.xxvi-p6"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.xxvi-p6.1"></span>Canon IV.</span>

<span id="xvii.xxvi-p7"></span>If Panuph the deacon married his
brother’s daughter before baptism, let him continue among the clergy, if
she be dead, and he had not to do with her after his baptism; but if he
married her, and cohabited with her while he was a communicant, let him
be ejected from the clergy, without prejudice to the bishop who ordained
him, if he did it ignorantly.

<span id="xvii.xxvi-p8"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.xxvi-p8.1"></span>Canon V.</span>

<span id="xvii.xxvi-p9"></span>If it do evidently appear, that Jacob,
while he was reader, did commit fornication, and was ejected by the
priests (<span class="Greek"><span
id="xvii.xxvi-p9.1"></span>πρεσβυτέρων</span>), and yet afterwards
ordained, let him be ejected, and not otherwise.

<span id="xvii.xxvi-p10"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.xxvi-p10.1"></span>Canon VI.</span>

<span id="xvii.xxvi-p11"></span>That all in holy orders unanimously
choose those who are to be ordained, and then the bishop examine
\[them\]; or that the bishop ordain them in the midst of the church, all
that are in holy orders consenting, and the bishop with a loud voice
asking the people, who are then to be present, whether they can give
their testimony \[to the parties to be ordained\]; and that ordination
be not performed in private; if there be in the remote country, who
while they were communicants \[with the Arians\] communicated in their
opinions, let them not be ordained until they be examined by orthodox
clergymen, in the presence of the bishop, who is to charge the people,
that there be no running up and down in the middle of the church, or
service.

<span id="xvii.xxvi-p12"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.xxvi-p12.1"></span>Canon VII.</span>

<span id="xvii.xxvi-p13"></span>Let the clergymen distribute all that is
offered by way of sacrifice, after so much as was necessary has been
consumed in the Mysteries.  Let not the catechumens taste of them, but
clergymen and communicants only. <span id="fr_605"></span>[606](#fn_605.md)

<span id="xvii.xxvi-p15"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.xxvi-p15.1"></span>Canon VIII.</span>

<span id="xvii.xxvi-p16"></span>One, Hierax, had delated a clergyman as
guilty of fornication.  Bishop Apollo defended him.  Theophilus orders
the matter to be examined.

<span id="xvii.xxvi-p17"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.xxvi-p17.1"></span>Canon IX.</span>

<span id="xvii.xxvi-p18"></span>That an Œconomus be created, by the
consent of all that are in Holy Orders, with the concurrence of Bishop
Apollo, that so the goods of the Church be expended as they ought.

<span id="xvii.xxvi-p19"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.xxvi-p19.1"></span>Canon X.</span>

<span id="xvii.xxvi-p20"></span>That the widows, poor, and travellers be
not disturbed; and that no one make a property of the goods of the
Church.

<span id="xvii.xxvi-p14"></span> Johnson gives this note.  “To eat the
main of what was left, was not at all inconsistent with reserving so
much as was necessary for foreseen and unforeseen emergencies.”
