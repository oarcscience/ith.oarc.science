id="vii.vi.xxv-p1.1"></span>Canon XVII.</span>

<span id="vii.vi.xxv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="vii.vi.xxv-p2.1"></span>Forasmuch</span> as many enrolled among the
Clergy, following covetousness and lust of gain, have forgotten the
divine Scripture, which says, “He hath not given his money upon usury,”
and in lending money ask the hundredth of the sum \[as monthly
interest\], the holy and great Synod thinks it just that if after this
decree any one be found to receive usury, whether he accomplish it by
secret transaction or otherwise, as by demanding the whole and one half,
or by using any other contrivance whatever for filthy lucre’s sake, he
shall be deposed from the clergy and his name stricken from the list.

<span id="vii.vi.xxv-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="vii.vi.xxv-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XVII.</span>

<span id="vii.vi.xxv-p5"></span>If anyone shall receive usury or 150 per
cent, he shall be cast forth and deposed, according to this decree of
the Church.

<span id="vii.vi.xxv-p7"></span>Although the canon expresses only these
two species of usury, if we bear in mind the grounds on which the
prohibition was made, it will be manifest that every kind of usury is
forbidden to clerics and under any circumstances, and therefore the
translation of this canon sent by the Orientals to the Sixth Council of
Carthage is in no respect alien to the true intent of the canon; for in
this version no mention is made of any particular kind of usury, but
generally the penalty is assigned to any clerics who “shall be found
after this decree taking usury” or thinking out any other scheme for the
sake of filthy lucre.

<span id="vii.vi.xxv-p8"></span>This Canon is found in the *Corpus Juris
Canonici*, in the first part of the *Decretum*, in Dionysius’s version. 
*Dist*. xlvii, c. ii, and again in Isidore’s version in Pars II, Causa
xiv. Quæs. iv., c. viii.
