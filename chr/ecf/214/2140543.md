<span id="xv.iv.iv.xx-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xx-p1.1"></span>Canon XIX.  (Greek xxii.) <span
id="fr_424"></span>[425](#fn_424) </span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xx-p3"></span>That if any bishop is accused the cause
should be brought before the primate of his own province.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xx-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xx-p4.1"></span>Aurelius</span>, the bishop, said: 
Whatever bishop is accused the accuser shall bring the case before the
primates of the province to which the accused belongs, and he shall not
be suspended from communion by reason of the crime laid to his charge
unless he fails to put in an appearance on the appointed day for arguing
his cause before the chosen judges, having been duly summoned by the
letters; that is, within the space of one month from the day in which he
is found to have received the letters.  But should he be able to prove
any true necessity which manifestly rendered it impossible for him to
appear, he shall have the opportunity of arguing his case within <span
id="page_452">p. 452</span> <span
id="xv.iv.iv.xx-Page_452"></span>another full month; but after the
second month he shall not communicate until he is acquitted.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xx-p5"></span>But if he is not willing to come to the
annual general council, so that his cause may there be terminated, he
himself shall be judged to have pronounced the sentence of his own
condemnation at the time in which he does not communicate, nor shall he
communicate either in his own church or diocese.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xx-p6"></span>But his accuser, if he has not missed
any of the days for pleading the cause, shall not be shut out from
communion; but if he has missed some of them, withdrawing himself, then
the bishop shall be restored to communion and the accuser shall be
removed from communion; so, nevertheless, that the possibility of going
on with the case be not taken from him, if he shall prove that his
absence was caused by lack of power and not by lack of will.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xx-p7"></span>And this is enacted, that if the
accuser turn out to be himself a criminal when the case against the
bishop has come to argument, he shall not be allowed to testify unless
he asserts that the causes are personal and not ecclesiastical.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xx-p8"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xx-p8.1"></span>Notes.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xx-p9"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xx-p9.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XIX.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xx-p10"></span>*A bishop accused and haled to
judgment shall have the space of two months; if there is any
excuse* <span id="fr_425"></span>[426](#fn_425) *for his delay from the
other side.  But after this he shall be excommunicated if he does not
appear.  But if when the accused is present the accuser flees, then the
accuser shall be deprived of communion.  But the accuser who is infamous
shall not be an accuser at all.*

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xx-p12"></span>This canon is made up from Canons VI.
and VII. of the last mentioned second series of the enactments of Hippo,
393.
