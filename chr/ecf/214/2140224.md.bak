<span id="viii.vii.iii.lviii-p7"></span>This canon does not call for
explanation but for reflexion, and greatly it is to be desired that it
should be observed by Christians, and that through like improprieties,
wedding-days, which should be days of holy joy and blessing, be not
turned, even to the bride and groom themselves, into days of cursing. 
Moreover the Synod of Trent admonishes bishops (*Sess*. xxiv., *De
Reform. Mat*., cap. x.) to take care that at weddings there be only that
which is modest and proper.
