<span id="xvii.xviii-p4"></span>One letter to the bishop subject to him,
wherein he prohibits to take money for orders, and to bring merchandize
into the church, which is entrusted with the Body, and Blood of Christ;
they had their pay after the ordination was performed; this he calls an
artifice, and declares, that he who is guilty of it shall depart from
the altar in his country, and go buy and sell the gift of God where he
can.
