id="xiv.iii.xxii-p1.1"></span>Canon XXI.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.xxii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.xxii-p2.1"></span>Those</span> who have become guilty of
crimes against the canons, and on this account subject to complete and
perpetual deposition, are degraded to the condition of layman.  If,
however, keeping conversion continually before their eyes, they
willingly deplore the sin on account of which they fell from grace, and
made themselves aliens therefrom, they may still cut their hair after
the manner of clerics.  But if they are not willing to submit themselves
to this canon, they must wear their hair as laymen, as being those who
have preferred the communion of the world to the celestial life.

<span id="xiv.iii.xxii-p5"></span>Whoever is already deposed and reduced
to the lay estate, if he shall repent, let him continue deposed but be
shorn.  But if otherwise, he must let his hair grow.

<span id="xiv.iii.xxii-p6"></span>Beveridge wishes to read “who have
become canonically guilty of crimes,” substituting <span
class="Greek"><span id="xiv.iii.xxii-p6.1"></span>κανονικῶς</span> for
<span class="Greek"><span
id="xiv.iii.xxii-p6.2"></span>κανονικοῖς</span>, in accordance with the
Bodleian and Amerbachian codices.
