<span id="viii.vii.iii.xlviii-p5"></span>A subdeacon should not leave
the gates, even for a short time, to pray.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xlviii-p6"></span>On this canon the commentators
find nothing to say in addition to their remarks on Canons xxj., and
xxij., except that the “prayer” is not their own private prayer, but the
prayer of the Liturgy.  It has struck me that possibly when there was no
deacon to sing the litany outside the Holy Gates while the priest was
going on with the holy action within, subdeacons may have left their
places at the doors, assumed the deacon’s stole and done his part of the
office, and that it was to prevent this abuse that this canon was
enacted, the “prayer” being the litany.  But as this is purely my own
suggestion it is probably valueless.
