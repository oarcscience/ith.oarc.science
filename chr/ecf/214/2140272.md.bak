<span id="x.ix.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="x.ix.xi-p1.1"></span>Excursus on How Our Lord Worked
Miracles.</span>

<span id="x.ix.xi-p2"></span>In view of the fact that many are now
presenting as if something newly discovered, and as the latest results
of biblical study, the interpretations of the early heretics with regard
to our Lord’s powers and to his relation to the Holy Ghost, I have here
set down in full Theodoret’s Counter-statement to the faith accepted by
the Ecumenical Councils of the Church.

<span id="x.ix.xi-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="x.ix.xi-p3.1"></span>Theodoret.</span>

<span id="x.ix.xi-p4"></span>(*Counter Statement to Anath. IX. of
Cyril*.)

<span id="x.ix.xi-p5"></span>Here he has plainly had the hardihood to
anathematize not only those who at the present time hold pious opinions,
but also those who were in former days heralds of truth; aye even the
writers of the divine Gospels, the band of the holy Apostles, and, in
addition to these, Gabriel the archangel.  For he indeed it was who
first, even before the conception, announced the birth of the Christ
according to the flesh; saying in reply to Mary when she asked, How
shall this be, seeing I know not a man? “The Holy Ghost shall come upon
thee and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee; therefore also
that holy thing that shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of
God.”  And to Joseph he said, “Fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife,
for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.”  And the
Evangelist says, “When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph…she was
found with child of the Holy Ghost.”  And the Lord himself when he had
come into the synagogue of the Jews and had taken the prophet Isaiah,
after reading the passage in which he says, “The Spirit of the Lord is
upon me because he hath anointed me” and so on, added, “This day is this
scripture fulfilled in your ears.”  And the blessed Peter in his sermon
to the Jews said, “God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost.” 
And Isaiah many ages before had predicted “There shall come forth a rod
out of the stem <span id="page_216">p. 216</span> <span
id="x.ix.xi-Page_216"></span>of Jesse, and a branch shall grow out of
his roots; and the Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him, the spirit of
wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of
knowledge and of the fear of the Lord”; and again, “Behold my servant
whom I uphold, my beloved in whom my soul delighteth.  I will put my
Spirit upon him:  he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles.”  This
testimony the Evangelist too has inserted in his own writings.  And the
Lord himself in the Gospels says to the Jews, “If I with the Spirit of
God cast out devils, no doubt the kingdom of God is come upon you.”  And
John says, “He that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto
me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and remaining on him,
the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.”  So this exact
examiner of the divine decrees has not only anathematized prophets,
apostles, and even the archangel Gabriel, but has suffered his blasphemy
to reach even the Saviour of the world himself.  For we have shewn that
the Lord himself after reading the passage “The Spirit of the Lord is
upon me because he had anointed me,” said to the Jews, “This day is this
scripture fulfilled in your ears.”  And to those who said that he was
casting out devils by Beelzebub he replied that he was casting them out
by the Spirit of God.  But we maintain that it was not God the Word, of
one substance and co-eternal with the Father, that was formed by the
Holy Ghost and anointed, but the human nature which was assumed by him
at the end of days.  We shall confess that the Spirit of the Son was his
own if he spoke of it as of the same nature and proceeding from the
Father, and shall accept the expression as consistent with true piety. 
But if he speaks of the Spirit as being of the Son, or as having its
origin through the Son we shall reject this statement as blasphemous and
impious.  For we believe the Lord when he says, “The spirit which
proceedeth from the Father”; and likewise the very divine Paul saying,
“We have received not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is
of God.”

<span id="x.ix.xi-p6"></span>In the foregoing will be found the very
same arguments used and the same texts cited against the Catholic faith
as are urged and cited by the Rev. A. J. Mason, *The Conditions of Our
Lord’s Life on Earth*, and by several other recent writers.
