<span id="xvi.vii-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xvi.vii-p4.1"></span>Constantine</span>, the most holy bishop of
Constantia in Cyprus, said:  Since I, unworthy that I am, find that the
letter which has just been read, which was sent from the East to
Tarasius the most holy archbishop and ecumenical patriarch, is in no
sense changed from that confession of faith which he himself had before
made, to these I consent and become of one mind, receiving and saluting
with honour the holy and venerable images.  But the worship of adoration
I reserve alone to the supersubstantial and life-giving Trinity.  And
those who are not so minded, and do not so teach I cast out of the holy
Catholic and Apostolic Church, and I smite them with anathema, and I
deliver them over to the lot of those who deny the incarnation and the
bodily economy of Christ our true God.

<span id="xvi.vii-p8"></span>By false translation and misunderstanding
the Frankish bishops subsequently at the Synod of Frankfort, <span
class="sc"><span id="xvi.vii-p8.1"></span>a.d.</span> 794, and also in
the Carolingian books (iii. 17), understood this to mean that a demand
had been made at Nicæa that the same devotion should be offered to the
images as to the Most Holy Trinity.

<span id="xvi.vii-p9"></span>Under these circumstances it is clear that
the Franks could do nothing but reject the decrees.  I have treated of
this whole matter elsewhere.
