<span id="viii.iii.iii.xv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.xv-p2.1"></span>Concerning</span> things belonging to
the church, which presbyters may have sold when there was no bishop, it
is decreed that the Church property shall be reclaimed; and it shall be
in the discretion of the bishop whether it is better to receive the
purchase price, or not; for oftentimes the revenue of the things sold
might yield them the greater value.

<span id="viii.iii.iii.xv-p5"></span>Sales of Church goods made by
presbyters are null, and the matter shall rest with the bishop.

<span id="viii.iii.iii.xv-p7"></span>If the purchaser of ecclesiastical
properties has realized more by the temporary revenue of such properties
than the price of the purchase, the Synod thinks there is no occasion to
restore him this price, as he has already received a sufficient
indemnity from the revenue, and as, according to the rules then in
force, *interest* drawn from the purchase money was not permitted. 
Besides, the purchaser had done wrong in buying ecclesiastical property
during the vacancy of a see (*sede vacante*).  Beveridge and Routh have
shown that in the text <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.xv-p7.1"></span>ἀνακαλεῖσθαι</span> and <span
class="Greek"><span id="viii.iii.iii.xv-p7.2"></span>πρόσοδον</span>
must be read. <span id="fr_116"></span>[117](#fn_116)
