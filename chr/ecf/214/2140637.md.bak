<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.cxiv-p1.1"></span>Canon CXIII.  (Greek cxiiii.)</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxiv-p2"></span>That without the grace of God we can
do no good thing.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxiv-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.cxiv-p3.1"></span>It</span> seemed good that whosoever
should say that the grace of justification was given to us only that we
might be able more readily by grace to perform what we were ordered to
do through our free will; as if though grace was not given, although not
easily, yet nevertheless we could even without grace fulfil the divine
commandments, let him be anathema.  For the Lord spake concerning the
fruits of the commandments, when he said:  “Without me ye can do
nothing,” and not “Without me ye could do it but with difficulty.”

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxiv-p6"></span>Whoso preaches that without grace we
could keep the commandments although with difficulty, is to be thrice
execrated.  For the Lord says, “Without me ye can do nothing.”

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxiv-p7"></span>This is Canon V. of Carthage, <span
