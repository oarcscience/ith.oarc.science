<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxx-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.lxx-p1.1"></span>Canon LXIX.  (Greek lxxii.)</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxx-p2"></span>That a legation be sent to the
Donatists for the sake of making peace.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxx-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.lxx-p3.1"></span>It</span> further seemed good, that when
these things were done, legates should be sent from our number to those
of the Donatists whom they hold as bishops, or to the people, for the
sake of preaching peace and unity, without which Christian salvation
cannot be attained; and that these legates should direct the attention
of all to the fact that they have no just objection to urge against the
Catholic Church.  And especially that this be made manifest to all by
the municipal acts (on account of the weight of their documents) what
they themselves had done in the case of the Maximianists, their own
schismatics.  For in this case it is shown them by divine grace, if they
will but heed it, that their separation from the unity of the Church is
as iniquitous as they now proclaim the schism of the Maximianists from
themselves to be.  Nevertheless from the number, those whom they
condemned by the authority of their plenary council, they received back
with their honours, and accepted the baptism which they had given while
condemned and cut off.  And thus let them see how with stupid heart they
resist the peace of the Church scattered throughout the whole world,
when they do these things on the part of Donatus, neither do they say
that they are contaminated by communion with those whom they so receive
for the making of peace, and yet they despise us, that is the Catholic
Church, which is established even in the extreme parts of the earth, as
being defiled by the communion of those whom the accusers have not been
able to win over to themselves. <span id="fr_463"></span>[464](#fn_463.md)

<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxx-p7"></span>It seemed good that legates be sent to
preach peace and unity to the Donatists who had been converted to the
orthodox faith.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxx-p8"></span>This canon is Canon iij. of Carthage,
September, <span class="sc"><span

<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxx-p4"></span> I think this is the probable meaning
of the canon.
