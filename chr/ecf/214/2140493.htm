<p class="c18"><a name="xv.iii.iii-p2"></A>The Canons of Sardica have come down to us both in Greek and Latin, and some writers such as Richer (<i>Histoire Conc. G&eacute;n&eacute;rale</i>, Tom. i., p. 98), have been of opinion that the Latin text alone was the original, while others, such as Walch (<i>Gesch. der Kirchenvers</i>., p. 179), have arrived at a directly opposite conclusion.&#160; Now, however, chiefly owing to the investigations of the Ballerini and of Spittler, the unanimous opinion of scholars&#8212;so says Hefele&#8212;is that the canons were originally drawn up in both languages, intended as they were for both Latins and Greeks.&#160; I may perhaps remind the reader that in many Western collections of canons the canons of Sardica immediately follow those of Nice without any break, or note that they were not enacted at that council.&#160; It will also be well to bear in mind that they were received by the Greeks as of Ecumenical authority by the Council in Trullo, and as such are contained in the body of the Greek Canon Law.</p> 
<p class="c19"><a name="xv.iii.iii-p3"></A>I have provided the reader with a very accurate translation of each text.</p>
