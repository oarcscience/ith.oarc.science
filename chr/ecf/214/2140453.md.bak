<span id="xiv.iii.lxx-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.lxx-p2.1"></span>It</span> is not permitted to a layman to
enter the sanctuary (Holy Altar, Gk.), though, in accordance with a
certain ancient tradition, the imperial power and authority is by no
means prohibited from this when he wishes to offer his gifts to the
Creator.

<span id="xiv.iii.lxx-p5"></span>No layman except the Emperor shall go
up to the altar.

<span id="xiv.iii.lxx-p7"></span>That in the Latin Church as well as in
the Greek for many centuries it was the constant custom, ratified by
various councils, that lay-men are to be excluded from the sanctuary and
from the place marked off for the priests who are celebrating the divine
mysteries, is so notorious as to need no proof, and the present canon
shows that among the Greeks the laity were not admitted to the
*sacrarium* even to make offerings.

<span id="xiv.iii.lxx-p8"></span>The Synod makes but one exception, to
wit, the Emperor, who can enter the rails of the holy altar by its
permission “when he wishes to offer his gifts to the Creator, according
to ancient custom.”

<span id="xiv.iii.lxx-p9"></span>Not without foundation does the Synod
claim “ancient custom” for this; for long before, it is evident, it was
the case from the words of the Emperor Theodosius the Younger.  See also
Theodoret (*H. E.*, lib. v., cap. xvij.).

<span id="xiv.iii.lxx-p10"></span>In the Latin Church, not only to
emperors, kings, and great princes but also to patrons of churches, to
toparchs of places, and even to magistrates, seats have been wont to be
assigned *honoris causâ* within the sanctuary or choir, and it has been
contended that these are properly due to such persons.

<span id="xiv.iii.lxx-p11"></span>It is evident from Balsamon’s note
that the later Greeks at least looked upon the Emperor as being (like
the kings of England and France) a *persona mixta*, sharing in some
degree the sacerdotal character, as being anointed not merely with oil,
but with the sacred chrism.  *Vide* in this connexion J. Wickham Legg,
*The Sacring of the English Kings*, in “The Archæological Journal,”
March, 1894.
