<span id="xv.iv.iv.xxxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xxxviii-p1.1"></span>Canon XXXVII.  (Greek xl.)</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xxxviii-p2"></span>It is not lawful to offer anything
in the Holy Mysteries except bread and wine mixed with water.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xxxviii-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xxxviii-p3.1"></span>In</span> the sacraments of the body
and blood of the Lord nothing else shall be offered than that which the
Lord himself ordained, that is to say, bread and wine mixed with water. 
But let the first-fruits, whether honey or milk, be offered on that one
most solemn day, as is wont, in the mystery of the infants.  For
although they are offered on the altar, let them have nevertheless their
own benediction, that they may be distinguished from the sacraments of
the Lord’s body and blood; neither let there be offered as first-fruits
anything other than grapes and corns.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xxxviii-p5"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xxxviii-p5.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon
XXXVII.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xxxviii-p6"></span>Let bread and wine mixed with
water only be offered.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xxxviii-p7"></span>The text of the Greek here does
not exactly agree with the Latin.  The Greek reads as follows:  “That in
the Holy Mysteries nothing else be offered than the body and blood of
the Lord, even as the Lord himself delivered, that is bread and wine
mixed with water.”

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xxxviii-p8"></span>Further down with regard to the
first-fruits I have followed the Greek text which seems decidedly
preferable, in fact the Latin is so corrupt that Van Espen notes that
for the ordinary “*offerantur*” some <span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xxxviii-p8.1"></span>mss.</span> read “*non offerantur*.”

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xxxviii-p9"></span>This canon is Canon xxiij. of the
Synod of Hippo, <span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xxxviii-p9.1"></span>a.d.</span> 393.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xxxviii-p12"></span>“The Mystery of Infants” of this
*Quære*, all that I have met with are in the dark as to this matter. 
Dionysius Exiguus’s Latin is *Lac*, etc.  The Greek stands thus, <span
