id="xv.iv.iv.vi-p1.1"></span>Canon V.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.vi-p2"></span>Of Avarice.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.vi-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.vi-p3.1"></span>Aurelius</span>, the bishop, said:  The
cupidity of avarice (which, let no one doubt, is the mother of all evil
things), is to be henceforth prohibited, lest anyone should usurp
another’s limits, or for gain should pass beyond the limits fixed by the
fathers, nor shall it be at all lawful for any of the clergy to receive
usury of any kind.  And those new edicts (*suggestiones*) which are
obscure and generally ambiguous, after they have been examined by us,
will have their value fixed (*formam accipiunt*); but with regard to
those upon which the Divine Scripture hath already most plainly given
judgment, it is unnecessary that further sentence should be pronounced,
but what is already laid down is to be carried out.  And what is
reprehensible in laymen is worthy of still more severe censure in the
clergy.  The whole synod said:  No one hath gone contrary to what is
said in the Prophets and in the Gospels with impunity.

id="xv.iv.iv.vi-p5.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon V.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.vi-p6"></span>As the taking of any kind of usury is
condemned in laymen, much more is it condemned in clergymen.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.vi-p7"></span>This canon is made up of Canons x. and
xiij. of the Synod of Carthage held under Gratus in <span
class="sc"><span id="xv.iv.iv.vi-p7.1"></span>a.d.</span> 345–348.  This
synod was held to return thanks for the ending of the Donatist schism;
and indeed for some time the evil did seem to have been removed. 
Donatist worship was prohibited by the imperial law and it was not until
the times of Constans and Constantius that it again openly asserted
itself.  The synod while in session also took advantage of the
opportunity of passing some useful general canons on discipline.
