id="viii.vii.iii.xxxv-p2.1"></span>None</span> of the priesthood, nor
clerics \[of lower rank\] nor ascetics, nor any Christian or layman,

the heathen.

id="viii.vii.iii.xxxv-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XXX.</span>

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xxxv-p5"></span>It is an abomination to bathe
with women.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xxxv-p6"></span>This canon was renewed by the
Synod in Trullo, canon lxxvij.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xxxv-p7"></span>Zonaras explains that the bathers
were entirely nude and hence arose the objection which was also felt by
the heathen.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xxxv-p8"></span>This canon is found in the
*Corpus Juris Canonici*, Gratian’s *Decretum*, Pars I., Dist. LXXXI, c.
xxviij.
