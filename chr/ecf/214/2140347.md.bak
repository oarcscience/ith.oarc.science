<span id="xi.xviii.xxix-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xi.xviii.xxix-p1.1"></span>Excursus on the Later History of Canon
XXVIII.</span>

<span id="xi.xviii.xxix-p2"></span>Among the bishops who gave their
answers at the last session to the question whether their subscription
to the canons was voluntary or forced was Eusebius, bishop of Dorylæum,
an Asiatic bishop who said that he had read the Constantinopolitan canon
to “the holy pope of Rome in presence of clerics of Constantinople, and
that he had accepted it” (L. and C., *Conc*., iv. 815).  But quite
possibly this evidence is of little value.  But what is more to the
point is that the Papal legates most probably had already at this very
council recognized the right of Constantinople to rank immediately after
Rome.  For at the very first session when the Acts of the Latrocinium
were read, it was found that to Flavian, the Archbishop of
Constantinople, was given only the fifth place.  Against this the bishop
protested and asked, “Why <span id="page_289">p. 289</span> <span
id="xi.xviii.xxix-Page_289"></span>did not Flavian receive his
position?” and the papal legate Paschasinus answered:  “We will, please
God, recognize the present bishop Anatolius of Constantinople as the
first \[i.e. after us\], but Dioscorus made Flavian the fifth.”  It
would seem to be in vain to attempt to escape the force of these words
by comparing with them the statement made in the last session, in a
moment of heat and indignation, by Lucentius the papal legate, that the
canons of Constantinople were not found among those of the Roman Code. 
It may well be that this statement was true, and yet it does not in any
way lessen the importance of the fact that at the first session (a very
different thing from the sixteenth) Paschasinus had admitted that
Constantinople enjoyed the second place.  It would seem that Quesnel has
proved his point, notwithstanding the attempts of the Ballerini to
counteract and overthrow his arguments.

<span id="xi.xviii.xxix-p3"></span>It would be the height of absurdity
for any one to attempt to deny that the canon of Constantinople was
entirely in force and practical execution, as far of those most
interested were concerned, long before the meeting of the council of
Chalcedon, and in 394, only thirteen years after the adoption of the
canon, we find the bishop of Constantinople presiding at a synod at
which both the bishop of Alexandria and the bishop of Antioch were
present.

<span id="xi.xviii.xxix-p4"></span>St. Leo made, in connexion with this
matter, some statements which perhaps need not be commented upon, but
should certainly not be forgotten.  In his epistle to Anatolius (no.
cvi.) in speaking of the third canon of Constantinople he says:  “That
document of certain bishops has never been brought by your predecessors
to the knowledge of the Apostolic See.”  And in writing to the Empress
(*Ep*. cv., *ad Pulch*.) he makes the following statement, strangely
contrary to what she at least knew to be the fact, “To this concession a
long course of years has given no effect!”

<span id="xi.xviii.xxix-p5"></span>We need not stop to consider the
question why Leo rejected the xxviijth canon of Chalcedon.  It is
certain that he rejected it and those who wish to see the motive of this
rejection considered at length are referred to Quesnel and to the
Ballerini; the former affirming that it was because of its encroachments
upon the prerogatives of his own see, the latter urging that it was only
out of his zeal for the keeping in full force of the Nicene decree.

<span id="xi.xviii.xxix-p6"></span>Leo can never be charged with
weakness.  His rejection of the canon was absolute and unequivocal.  In
writing to the Emperor he says that Anatolius only got the See of
Constantinople by his consent, that he should behave himself modestly,
and that there is no way he can make of Constantinople “an Apostolic
See,” and adds that “only from love of peace and for the restoration of
the unity of the faith” he has “abstained from annulling this
ordination” (*Ep*. civ.).

<span id="xi.xviii.xxix-p7"></span>To the Empress he wrote with still
greater violence:  “As for the resolution of the bishops which is
contrary to the Nicene decree, in union with your faithful piety, I
declare it to be invalid and annul it by the authority of the holy
Apostle Peter” (*Ep*. cv.).

<span id="xi.xviii.xxix-p8"></span>The papal annulling does not appear
to have been of much force, for Leo himself confesses, in a letter
written about a year later to the Empress Pulcheria (*Ep*. cxvi.), that
the Illyrian bishops had since the council subscribed the xxviiith
canon.

<span id="xi.xviii.xxix-p9"></span>The pope had taken occasion in his
letter in which he announced his acceptance of the doctrinal decrees of
Chalcedon to go on further and express his rejection of the canons. 
This part of the letter was left unread throughout the Greek empire, and
Leo complains of it to Julian of Cos (*Ep*. cxxvij.).

<span id="xi.xviii.xxix-p10"></span>Leo never gave over his opposition,
although the breach was made up between him and Anatolius by an
apparently insincere letter on the part of the latter (*Ep*. cxxxii.). 
Leo’s successors followed his example in rejecting the canons, both the
IIId of Constantinople and the <span class="sc"><span
id="xi.xviii.xxix-p10.1"></span>XXVIII</span>th of Chalcedon, but as M.
l’abbé Duchesne so admirably says:  “Mais leur voix fut peu écoutée; on
leur accorda sans doute des satisfactions, mais de pure
cérémonie.” <span id="fr_295"></span>[296](#fn_295.md)   But <span
id="page_290">p. 290</span> <span
id="xi.xviii.xxix-Page_290"></span>Justinian acknowledged the
Constantinopolitan and Chalcedonian rank of Constantinople in his
CXXXIst Novel. (cap. j.), and the Synod in Trullo in canon xxxvj.
renewed exactly canon xxviij. of Chalcedon.  Moreover the Seventh
Ecumenical with the approval of the Papal Legates gave a general
sanction to all the canons accepted by the Trullan Synod.  And finally
in 1215 the Fourth Council of the Lateran in its Vth Canon acknowledged
Constantinople’s rank as immediately after Rome, but this was while
Constantinople was in the hands of the Latins!  Subsequently at Florence
the second rank, in accordance with the canons of I. Constantinople and
of Chalcedon (which had been annulled by Leo) was given to the Greek
Patriarch of Constantinople, and so the opposition of Rome gave way
after seven centuries and a half, and the Nicene Canon which Leo
declared to be “inspired by the Holy Ghost” and “valid to the end of
time” (*Ep*. cvi.), was set at nought by Leo’s successor in the
Apostolic See.

<span id="xi.xviii.xxix-p12"></span>From the Acts of the same Holy Synod
concerning Photius, Bishop of Tyre, and Eustathius, Bishop of Berytus.

<span id="xi.xviii.xxix-p13"></span>The most magnificent and glorious
judges said:

<span id="xi.xviii.xxix-p14"></span>What is determined by the Holy Synod
\[in the matter of the Bishops ordained by the most religious Bishop
Photius, but removed by the most religious Bishop Eustathius and ordered
to be Presbyters after (having held) the Episcopate\]?

<span id="xi.xviii.xxix-p15"></span>The most religious Bishops
Paschasinus and Lucentius, and the Priest Boniface, representatives of
the Church <span id="fr_296"></span>[297](#fn_296.md) of Rome, said:
