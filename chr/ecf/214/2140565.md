<span id="xv.iv.iv.xlii-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xlii-p1.1"></span>Canon XLI.  (Greek xliv.)</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xlii-p2"></span>That by men who are fasting
sacrifices are to be offered to God.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xlii-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xlii-p3.1"></span>That</span> the Sacraments of the Altar
are not to be celebrated except by those who are fasting, except on the
one anniversary of the celebration of the Lord’s Supper; for if the
commemoration of some of the dead, whether bishops or others, is to be
made in the afternoon, let it be only with prayers, if those who
officiate have already breakfasted.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xlii-p5"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xlii-p5.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XLI.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xlii-p6"></span>The holy mysteries are not offered
except by those who are fasting.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xlii-p7"></span>This canon is Canon xxviij. of the
Synod of Hippo, <span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xlii-p7.1"></span>a.d.</span> 393.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xlii-p8"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xlii-p8.1"></span>Johnson.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xlii-p9"></span>From this canon and the 29th of
Trullo, it is evident that by the Lord’s Supper, the ancients understood
the supper going before the Eucharist, and not the Eucharist itself, and
that on Maunday-Thursday <span id="fr_441"></span>[442](#fn_441) yearly,
before the Eucharist, they had such a public entertainment in imitation
of our Saviour’s last Paschal Supper.  I refer it to the consideration
of the learned reader, whether St. Paul, by the <span
class="Greek"><span id="xv.iv.iv.xlii-p10.1"></span>Δεῖπνον
κυριακὸν</span>, [1 Cor. xi. 20](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#020)<span
id="xv.iv.iv.xlii-p10.2"></span>, does not mean this entertainment.  For
the obvious translation of that verse is, “It is not your \[duty or
business\] when you meet together \[in the church\] to eat the Lord’s
Supper.”  <span id="page_462">p. 462</span> <span
id="xv.iv.iv.xlii-Page_462"></span>He would not have them to eat this
supper in the public assembly:  “For” (says he) “have ye not houses to
eat and drink in, or despise ye the Church of God?”  From the 4th age
forward, the Eucharist was sometimes called the Lord’s Supper; but from
the beginning it was not so.  And even after it did sometimes pass by
this name, yet at other times this name was strictly used for the
previous entertainment, as may be seen by this canon, which was made in
the 4th century.  Further it seems probable, that the Lord’s Supper and
the Love-feast was the same, though it was not usually called the Lord’s
Supper; but only (perhaps) that love-feast, which was made on the day of
the institution of the Eucharist, which we now call Maundy-Thursday.
