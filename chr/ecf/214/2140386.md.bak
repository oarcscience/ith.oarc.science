<span id="xiv.iii.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xiv.iii.iii-p1.1"></span>Canon III.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.iii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.iii-p2.1"></span>Since</span> our pious and Christian
Emperor has addressed this holy and ecumenical council, in order that it
might provide for the purity of those who are in the list of the clergy,
and who transmit divine things to others, and that they may be blameless
ministrants, and worthy of the sacrifice of the great God, who is both
Offering and High Priest, a sacrifice apprehended by the intelligence: 
and that it might cleanse away the pollutions wherewith these have been
branded by unlawful marriages:  now whereas they of the most holy Roman
Church purpose to keep the rule of exact perfection, but those who are
under the throne of this heaven-protected and royal city keep that of
kindness and consideration, so blending both together as our fathers
have done, and as the love of God requires, that neither gentleness fall
into licence, nor severity into harshness; especially as the fault of
ignorance has reached no small number of men, we decree, that those who
are involved in a second marriage, and have been slaves to sin up to the
fifteenth of the past month of January, in the past fourth Indiction,
the 6109th year, and have not resolved to repent of it, be subjected to
canonical deposition:  but that they who are involved in this disorder
of a second marriage, but before our decree have acknowledged what is
fitting, and have cut off their sin, and have put far from them this
strange and illegitimate connexion, or they whose wives by second
marriage are already dead, or who have turned to repentance of their own
accord, having learnt continence, and having quickly forgotten their
former iniquities, whether they be presbyters or deacons, these we have
determined should cease from all priestly ministrations or exercise,
being under punishment for a certain time, but should retain the honour
of their seat and station, being satisfied with their seat before the
laity and begging with tears from the Lord that the transgression of
their ignorance be pardoned them:  for unfitting it were that he should
bless another who has to tend his own wounds.  But those who have been
married to one wife, if she was a widow, and likewise those who after
their ordination have unlawfully entered into one marriage that is,
presbyters, and deacons, and subdeacons, being debarred for some short
time from sacred ministration, and censured, shall be restored again to
their proper rank, never advancing to any further rank, their unlawful
marriage being openly dissolved.  This we decree to hold good only in
the case of those that are involved in the aforesaid <span
id="page_363">p. 363</span> <span
id="xiv.iii.iii-Page_363"></span>faults up to the fifteenth (as was
said) of the month of January, of the fourth Indiction, decreeing from
the present time, and renewing the Canon which declares, that he who has
been joined in two marriages after his baptism, or has had a concubine,
cannot be bishop, or presbyter, or deacon, or at all on the sacerdotal
list; in like manner, that he who has taken a widow, or a divorced
person, or a harlot, or a servant, or an actress, cannot be bishop, or
presbyter, or deacon, or at all on the sacerdotal list.

id="xiv.iii.iii-p3.1"></span>Notes.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.iii-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.iii-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon III.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.iii-p5"></span>Priests who shall have contracted
second marriages and will not give them up are to be deposed.  But those
who leave off the wickedness, let them cease for a fixed period.  For he
that is himself wounded does not bless.  But who are implicated in
nefarious marriage and who after ordination have contracted marriage,
after a definite time they shall be restored to their grade, provided
they remain without offence, having plainly broken off the marriage. 
But if after it shall have been prohibited by this decree they attempt
to do so they shall remain deposed.

<span id="xiv.iii.iii-p7"></span>What things pertain to this third canon
are only adapted to the time in which the canon was passed; and
afterwards are of no force at all.  But what things the Fathers wished
to be binding on posterity are contained in the seventeenth and
eighteenth canons of the holy Apostles, which as having been neglected
during the course of time this synod wished to renew.

<span id="xiv.iii.iii-p8"></span><span class="sc"><span

<span id="xiv.iii.iii-p9"></span>It is clear from this canon that the
Emperor very especially intended that the indulgence which the Church of
Constantinople extended to its presbyters and deacons in allowing them
the use of marriage entered into before ordination, should not be
allowed to go any further, nor to be an occasion for the violation of
that truly Apostolic canon, “The bishop, the presbyter, and the deacon
must be the husband of one wife.” [I Tim. iii.
2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#002.md)<span id="xiv.iii.iii-p9.1"></span>.

<span id="xiv.iii.iii-p10"></span>For never did the Constantinopolitan
nor any other Eastern Church allow by canon a digamist (or a man
successively the husband of many wives) to be advanced to the order of
presbyter or deacon, or to use any second marriage.

<span id="xiv.iii.iii-p11"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.iii-p11.1"></span>Antonio Pereira.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.iii-p12"></span>(*Tentativa Theologica*. \[Eng.
trans.\] III. Principle, p. 79.)

<span id="xiv.iii.iii-p13"></span>In the same manner a second marriage
always, and everywhere, incapacitated the clergy for Holy Orders and the
Episcopate.  This appears from St. Paul, 1 Tim. Chap. iii., and Titus,
Chap. i., and it was expressly enacted by the sixteenth of the
Apostolical Canons, renewed by the Popes Siricius, Innocent and Leo the
Great, and may be gathered from the ancient fathers and councils
generally received in the Church.

<span id="xiv.iii.iii-p14"></span>Nevertheless we know from Theodoret,
Bishop of Cyrus, that many bishops remarkable for their learning and
sanctity, frequently dispensed with this Apostolical law; as Alexander
of Antioch, Acacius of Berea, Praylius of Jerusalem, Proclus of
Constantinople, and others, by whose example Theodoret defends his own
conduct in the case of Irenæus, in ordaining him Archbishop of Tyre,
although he had been twice married.  But what is more surprising in this
matter is that, notwithstanding the eleventh Decretal of Siricius, and
the twelfth of Innocentius the First, that they who had either been
twice married, or had married widows, were incapable of ordination, and
ought to be deposed; the Council of Toledo, Canon 3, and the First
Council of Orange, Canon 25, both dispensed with these Pontifical laws. 
The first, in order that those who had married widows might remain in
holy orders; the second, that such as had twice married might be
promoted to the order of subdeacon.  Socrates also observes that
although it was a general law not to admit catechumens to orders, the
bishops of Alexandria were in the habit of promoting such to the order
of readers and singers.

<span id="xiv.iii.iii-p16"></span>(*H. E.*, Liv. XL., chap. 1.)

<span id="xiv.iii.iii-p17"></span>These canons of the Council of Trullo
have served ever since to the Greeks and to all the Christians of the
East as the universal rule with regard to clerical continence, and they
have been now in full force for a thousand years.  That is to say, It is
not permitted to men who are clerics in Holy Orders to marry after their
ordination.  Bishops must keep perfect continence, whether before their
consecration they are married or not.  Priests, deacons, and subdeacons
already married can keep their wives and live with them, except on the
days they are to approach the holy mysteries.
