<span id="viii.iv.iii.i-p5"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iv.iii.i-p5.1"></span>If</span> a presbyter marry, let him be
removed from his order; but if he commit fornication or adultery, let
him be altogether cast out \[i.e. of communion\] and put to penance.

<span id="viii.iv.iii.i-p7"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iv.iii.i-p7.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon I.</span>

<span id="viii.iv.iii.i-p8"></span>If a presbyter marries he shall be
deposed from his order.  If he commits adultery or whoredom he shall be
expelled, and shall be put to penance.

<span id="viii.iv.iii.i-p9"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iv.iii.i-p9.1"></span>Aristenus.</span>

<span id="viii.iv.iii.i-p10"></span>A presbyter who marries is removed
from the exercise of the priesthood but retains his honour and seat. 
But he that commits fornication or adultery is cast forth altogether and
put to penance.

<span id="viii.iv.iii.i-p11"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iv.iii.i-p11.1"></span>Van Espen.</span>

<span id="viii.iv.iii.i-p12"></span>These fathers \[i.e. of Neocæsarea\]
shew how much graver seemed to them the sin of the presbyter who after
ordination committed fornication or adultery, than his who took a wife. 
For the former they declare shall simply be deposed from his order or
deprived of the dignity of the Priesthood, but the latter is to “be
altogether cast out, and put to penance.”…Therefore such a presbyter not
only did they remove from the priestly functions, or the dignity of the
priesthood, but perfectly or altogether cast him out of the Church.

<span id="viii.iv.iii.i-p13"></span>This canon Gratian has inserted in
the *Corpus Juris Canonici*.  *Decretum*.  Pars I., Dist. xxviii., c.
ix.  Gratian has followed Isidore in adding after the word “penance” the
words “among the laity” (*inter laicos*) which do not occur in the
Greek, (as is noted by the Roman Correctors) nor in the version of
Dionysius Exiguus; these same correctors fall however themselves into a
still graver error in supposing that criminous clerks in the early days
of the Church were sent out to wander over the country, as Van Espen
well points out.

<span id="viii.iv.iii.i-p14"></span>On the whole subject of the marriage
of the clergy in the Early Church see the Excursus devoted to that
subject.
