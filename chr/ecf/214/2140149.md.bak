id="viii.vi.iv.xii-p1.1"></span>Canon XII.</span>

<span id="viii.vi.iv.xii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.vi.iv.xii-p2.1"></span>If</span> any presbyter or deacon
deposed by his own bishop, or any bishop deposed by a synod, shall dare
to trouble the ears of the Emperor, when it is his duty to submit his
case to a greater synod of bishops, and to refer to more bishops the
things which he thinks right, and to abide by the examination and
decision made by them; if, despising these, he shall trouble the
Emperor, he shall be entitled to no pardon, neither shall he have an
opportunity of defence, nor any hope of future restoration.

<span id="viii.vi.iv.xii-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.vi.iv.xii-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XII.</span>

<span id="viii.vi.iv.xii-p5"></span>One deposed, if he shall have
troubled the Emperor, shall seek the greater synod, and submit to its
decree.  But if he again misbehave himself, he shall not have any chance
of restoration.

<span id="viii.vi.iv.xii-p6"></span>It is usually supposed that this
canon, as well as the fourth, and the fourteenth and fifteenth, was
directed against St. Athanasius, and it was used against St. Chrysostom
by his enemies.  *Vide* Socrates, *Ecclesiastical History*, Book II.,
Chapter viij., and Sozomen’s *Ecclesiastical History*, Book III.,
chapter v.; also *ibid*. Book VII., chapter xx.

<span id="viii.vi.iv.xii-p7"></span>This canon is found in the *Corpus
Juris Canonici*, Gratian’s *Decretum*, Pars II., Causa XXI., Quæst. V.,
Can. ij., in Isidore’s Version.
