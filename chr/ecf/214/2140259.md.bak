<span id="x.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="x.vii-p1.1"></span>Historical Introduction to St. Cyril’s
Anathematisms.</span>

<span id="x.vii-p2"></span>There has been some difference of opinion
among the learned as to whether St. Cyril’s Synodal letter which has at
its end the anathemas against Nestorius, which hereafter follow, was
formally approved at the Council of Ephesus.  The matter is one only of
archeological and historical interest, for from a theological point of
view the question is entirely uninteresting, since there is no possible
doubt that the synod endorsed St. Cyril’s teaching and for that express
reason proceeded at their first session to excommunicate Nestorius. 
Further there is no one that disputes that the anathematisms were
received at the next General Council. i.e., of Chalcedon, only twenty
years later, and that Theodoret was condemned by the Fifth Ecumenical
Council because he wrote against these very Anathemas.  This being <span
id="page_200">p. 200</span> <span id="x.vii-Page_200"></span>the case,
to those who value the decrees of Ecumenical Councils because of their
ecumenical character, it is quite immaterial whether these anathematisms
were received and approved by the third Council or no, provided, which
is indisputably the case, they have been approved by some one council of
ecumenical authority, so as to become thereby part and parcel of the
ecumenical faith of the Church.

<span id="x.vii-p3"></span>But the historical question is one of some
interest, and I shall very briefly consider it.  We have indeed the
“Acta” of this council, but I cannot but agree with the very learned
Jesuit Petavius and the Gallican Tillemont in thinking them in a very
unsatisfactory condition.  I am fully aware of the temerity of making
such a suggestion, but I cannot help feeling that in the remarks of the
Roman representatives, especially in those of the presbyter-legate,
there is some anachronism.  Be this as it may, it is a fact that the
Acts do not recite that this letter of Cyril’s was read, nor do they
state that the Anathemas were received.  I would suggest, however, that
for those who defend John of Antioch, and criticise the action of St.
Cyril, it is the height of inconsistency to deny that the Council
adopted the Anathemas.  If it was the bitterly partisan assembly that
they would have us believe, absolutely under the control of Cyril, there
is nothing that, *<span class="Greek"><span
id="x.vii-p3.1"></span>ὰ</span>* *priori*, they would have been more
sure to do than adopt the Anathemas which were universally looked upon
as the very fulcrum on which the whole matter turned.

<span id="x.vii-p4"></span>Bishop Hefele was at first of opinion that
the letter was merely read, being led to this conclusion by the silence
of the Acts with regard to any acceptance of it, and indeed at first
wrote on that side, but he afterwards saw grounds to change his mind and
expresses them with his usual clearness, in the following words:

<span id="x.vii-p5"></span>(Hefele, *Hist. of Councils*. Vol. III., p.
48, note 2.)

<span id="x.vii-p6"></span>We were formerly of opinion that these
anathematisms were read at Ephesus, but not expressly confirmed, as
there is hardly anything on the subject in the Acts.  But in the Fifth
Ecumenical Council (collatio vj.) it is said:  “The holy Council at
Chalcedon approved this teaching of Cyril of blessed memory, and
received his Synodical letters, to one of which are appended the xij.
anathemas” (Mansi, t. ix., p. 341; Hardouin, t. iij., p. 167).  If,
however, the anathematisms of Cyril were expressly confirmed at
Chalcedon, there was even more reason for doing so at Ephesus.  And
Ibas, in his well-known letter to Maris, says expressly that the Synod
of Ephesus confirmed the anathematisms of Cyril, and the same was
asserted even by the bishops of Antioch at Ephesus in a letter to the
Emperor.

<span id="x.vii-p7"></span>From all these considerations it would seem
that Tillemont’s <span id="fr_239"></span>[240](#fn_239.md) conclusion is
well founded that the Synod certainly discussed the anathemas of Cyril
in detail, but that here, as in many other places, there are parts of
the Acts lacking.  I shall add the opinion of Petavius.

<span id="x.vii-p9"></span>(Petavius, *De Incarnatione*, Lib. VI., cap.
xvij.)

<span id="x.vii-p10"></span>The Acts do not tell us what judgment the
Synod of Ephesus gave with respect to the third letter of Cyril, and
with regard to the anathemas attached to it.  But the Acts in other
respects also have not come down to us in their integrity.  That that
third letter was received and approved by the Ephesine Council there can
be no doubt, and this the Catholics shewed in their dispute with the
Acephali in the Collation held at Constantinople under the Emperor
Justinian in the year of Christ 811.  For at that memorable meeting
something was shewn forth concerning this letter and its anathemas,
which has a connexion with the matter in hand, and therefore must not be
omitted.  At that meeting the Opposers, that is the Acephali, the
enemies of the Council of Chalcedon, made this objection against that
<span id="page_201">p. 201</span> <span
id="x.vii-Page_201"></span>Council:  “The \[letter\] of the Twelve
Anathemas which is inserted in the holy Council of Ephesus, and which
you cannot deny to be synodical, why did not Chalcedon receive it?”
etc., etc.

<span id="x.vii-p11"></span>From this it is evident that the prevailing
opinion, then as now, was that the Twelve Anathemas were defined as part
of the faith by the Council of Ephesus.  Perhaps I may close this
treatment of the subject in the words of Denziger, being the caption he
gives the xij. Anathematisms in his *Enchiridion*, under “Decrees of the
Third Ecumenical Council, that of Ephesus.”  “The Third Synod received
these anathematisms; the Fourth Synod placed them in its Acts and styled
the Epistles of Cyril ‘Canonical’; the Fifth Synod defended them.”
