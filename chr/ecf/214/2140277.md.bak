<span id="x.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="x.xi-p1.1"></span>Decree of the Council Against Nestorius.</span>

<span id="x.xi-p2"></span>(*Found in all the* Concilia *in Greek with
Latin Versions*.)

<span id="x.xi-p3"></span>As, in addition to other things, the impious
Nestorius has not obeyed our citation, and did not receive the holy
bishops who were sent by us to him, we were compelled to examine his
ungodly doctrines.  We discovered that he had held and published impious
doctrines in his letters and treatises, as well as in discourses which
he delivered in this city, and which have been testified to.  Compelled
thereto by the canons and by the letter (<span class="Greek"><span
id="x.xi-p3.1"></span>ἀναγκαίως κατεπειχθέντες ἀπό τε τῶν κανόνων, καὶ
ἐκ τὴς ἐπιστολῆς, κ.τ.λ</span>.) of our most holy father and
fellow-servant Cœlestine, the Roman bishop, we have come, with many
tears, to this sorrowful sentence against him, namely, that our Lord
Jesus Christ, whom he has blasphemed, decrees by the holy Synod that
Nestorius be excluded from the episcopal dignity, and from all priestly
communion.

<span id="x.xi-p4"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="x.xi-p4.1"></span>Notes.</span>

<span id="x.xi-p5"></span>The words for which I have given the original
Greek, are not mentioned by Canon Bright in his Article on St. Cyril in
Smith and Wace’s *Dictionary of Christian Biography*; nor by Ffoulkes in
his article on the Council of Ephesus in Smith and Cheetham’s
*Dictionary of Christian Antiquities*.  They do not appear in Canon
Robertson’s *History of the Church*.  <span id="page_219">p. 219</span>
<span id="x.xi-Page_219"></span>And strangest of all, Dean Milman cites
the sentence in English in the text and in Greek in a note but in each
case omits all mention of the letter of the Pope, marking however in the
Greek that there is an omission.  (*Lat. Chr*., Bk. II., Chap.
III.) <span id="fr_256"></span>[257](#fn_256.md)   I also note that the
translation in the English edition of Hefele’s *History of the Councils*
(Vol. III., p. 51) is misleading and inaccurate, “Urged by the canons,
and in accordance with the letter etc.”  The participle by itself might
mean nothing more than “urged” (*vide* Liddell and Scott on this verb
and also <span class="Greek"><span id="x.xi-p6.1"></span>ἐπείγω</span>)
but the adverb which precedes it, <span class="Greek"><span
id="x.xi-p6.2"></span>ἀναγκαίως</span> , certainly is sufficient to
necessitate the *coacti* of the old Latin version which I have followed,
translating “compelled thereto.”  It will also be noticed that while the
prepositions used with regard to the “canons” and the “letter” are
different, yet that their grammatical relation to the verb is identical
is shewn by the <span class="Greek"><span
id="x.xi-p6.3"></span>τε</span>—<span class="Greek"><span
id="x.xi-p6.4"></span>καὶ</span>, which proves the translation cited
above to be utterly incorrect.

<span id="x.xi-p7"></span>Hefele for the “canons” refers to canon number
lxxiv. of the Apostolic Canons; which orders an absent bishop to be
summoned thrice before sentence be given against him.

<span id="x.xi-p6"></span> Complaint of all this has very justly been
made recently by the Rev. Luke Rivington, a Roman Catholic writer, in
his work *The Primitive Church and the See of Peter*, p. 336.
