<span id="xiv.iii.xvii-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xiv.iii.xvii-p1.1"></span>Canon XVI.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.xvii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.xvii-p2.1"></span>Since</span> the book of the Acts tells us
that seven deacons were appointed by the Apostles, and the synod of
Neocæsarea in the canons which it put forth determined that there ought
to be canonically only seven deacons, even if the city be very large, in
accordance with the book of the Acts; we, having fitted the mind of the
fathers to the Apostles’ words, find that they spoke not of those men
who ministered at the Mysteries but in the administration which pertains
to the serving of tables.  For the book of the Acts reads as follows: 
“In those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there
arose a murmuring dissension of the Grecians against the Hebrews,
because their widows were neglected in the daily ministrations.  And the
Twelve called the multitude of the disciples with them and said, It is
not meet for us to leave the word of God and serve tables.  Look ye out
therefore, brethren, from among you seven men of good report full of the
Holy Ghost and of wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.  But
we will give ourselves continually unto prayer and unto the ministry of
the word.  And the saying pleased the whole multitude:  and they chose
Stephen a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and
Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte
of Antioch:  whom they set before the Apostles.”

<span id="xiv.iii.xvii-p3"></span>John Chrysostom, a Doctor of the
Church, interpreting these words, proceeds thus:  “It is a remarkable
fact that the multitude was not divided in its choice of the men, and
that the Apostles were not rejected by them.  But we must learn what
sort of rank they had, and what ordination they received.  Was it that
of deacons?  But this office did not yet exist in the churches.  But was
it the dispensation of a presbyter?  But there was not as yet any
bishop, but only Apostles, whence I think it is clear and manifest that
neither of deacons nor of presbyters was there then the name.” <span
id="fr_362"></span>[363](#fn_362.md)

<span id="xiv.iii.xvii-p5"></span>But on this account therefore we also
announce that the aforesaid seven deacons are not to be understood as
deacons who served at the Mysteries, according to the teaching before
set forth, but that they were those to whom a dispensation was entrusted
for the common benefit of those that were gathered together, who to us
in this also were a type of philanthropy and zeal towards those who are
in need.

<span id="xiv.iii.xvii-p7"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.xvii-p7.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XVI.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.xvii-p8"></span>Whoever affirms that the number of
deacons should be seven according to the saying of the Acts, should know
that the reference in that passage is not to Deacons of the Mysteries
but to such as serve tables.

<span id="xiv.iii.xvii-p9"></span>Van Espen here reminds us that this
is, as Zonaras calls attention to in his scholion on this place, a
correction rather than an interpretation of the <span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.xvii-p9.1"></span>XV</span>th Canon of Neocæsarea, and
Balsamon also says the same.  The only interest that the matter
possesses is that a canon which had been received by the Fourth
Ecumenical Council (Chalcedon) should receive such treatment from such
an assembly as the Synod in Trullo.

<span id="xiv.iii.xvii-p4"></span> I have not followed the Oxford
translation, which seems to me to have reversed the point.  In a
foot-note to that translation (Chrysostom on Acts, Part I., p. 199) will
be found a translation of this canon.
