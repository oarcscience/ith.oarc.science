<span id="xiv.iii.lxxxv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.lxxxv-p2.1"></span>Following</span> the canonical laws of
the Fathers, we decree concerning infants, as often as they are found
without trusty witnesses who say that they are undoubtedly baptized; and
as often as they are themselves unable on account of their age to answer
satisfactorily in respect to the initiatory mystery given to them; that
they ought without any offence to be baptized, lest such a doubt might
deprive them of the sanctification of such a purification.

<span id="xiv.iii.lxxxv-p5"></span>Whoever do not know nor can prove by
documents that they have been baptized, let them be christened.

<span id="xiv.iii.lxxxv-p6"></span>This is canon VII., of the Sixth
Council of Carthage, (*Vide* Hefele, *Hist. of the Councils*, Vol. II.,
p. 424); and Canon lxxv., of the African code (to which Balsam on
attributes this canon), by the Greek numbering, (lxxii. by the Latin).
