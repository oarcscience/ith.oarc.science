<span id="viii.iii.iii.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.xiv-p1.1"></span>Canon XIV.</span>

<span id="viii.iii.iii.xiv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.xiv-p2.1"></span>It</span> is decreed that among the
clergy, presbyters and deacons who abstain from flesh shall taste of it,
and afterwards, if they shall so please, may abstain.  But if they
disdain it, and will not even eat herbs served with flesh, but disobey
the canon, let them be removed from their order.

<span id="viii.iii.iii.xiv-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.xiv-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XIV.</span>

<span id="viii.iii.iii.xiv-p5"></span>*A priest who is an abstainer from
flesh, let him merely taste it and so let him abstain.  But if he will
not taste even the vegetables cooked with the meat let him be deposed*
(<span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.xiv-p5.1"></span>πεπάυσθω</span>).

<span id="viii.iii.iii.xiv-p6"></span>There is a serious dispute about
the reading of the Greek text.  I have followed Routh, who, relying on
three <span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.xiv-p6.1"></span>mss.</span> the *Collectio* of John of
Antioch and the Latin versions, reads <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.xiv-p6.2"></span>εἰ δὲ βδελύσσοιντο</span> instead of
the <span class="Greek"><span id="viii.iii.iii.xiv-p6.3"></span>εἰ δὲ
βούλοιντο</span> of the ordinary text, which as Bp. Beveridge had
pointed out before has no meaning unless a <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.xiv-p6.4"></span>μὴ</span> be introduced.

<span id="viii.iii.iii.xiv-p7"></span>Zonaras points out that the canon
chiefly refers to the Love feasts.

<span id="viii.iii.iii.xiv-p8"></span>I cannot agree with Hefele in his
translation of the last clause.  He makes the reference to “this present
canon,” I think it is clearly to the 53 (52) of the so-called Canons of
the Apostles, <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.xiv-p8.1"></span>τῷ κανόνι</span> “the well-known
Canon.”
