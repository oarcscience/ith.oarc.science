<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxv-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.lxv-p1.1"></span>Canon LXIV.  (Greek lxvii.)</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxv-p2"></span>Of celebrating manumissions in church,
that permission be asked from the Emperor.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxv-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.lxv-p3.1"></span>Concerning</span> the publishing of
manumissions in church, if our fellow bishops throughout Italy shall be
found to do this, it will be a mark of our confidence to follow their
order \[of proceedings\], full power being given to the legate we send,
that whatever he can accomplish worthy of the faith, for the state of
the Church and the salvation of souls, we shall laudably accept in the
sight of the Lord.  All which things, if they please your sanctity, pray
set forth, that I may be assured that my suggestion has been ratified by
you and that their sincerity may freely accept our unanimous action. 
And all the bishops said:  The things which have been enjoined to be
done and have been wisely set forth by your holiness are pleasing to
all.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxv-p5"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.lxv-p5.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon LXIV.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxv-p6"></span>The Emperor’s permission should be
sought to allow the public manumission of slaves in church.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxv-p7"></span>This is Canon viij. of the Synod of
Carthage, June 15 (or 16), <span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.lxv-p7.1"></span>a.d.</span> 401.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxv-p9"></span>It is certain, that in Italy, and some
other parts of the Empire, slaves were solemnly set at liberty by their
masters, in the church and presence of the bishop, from the time of
Constantine, but it should seem this custom had not yet obtained in
Africa.
