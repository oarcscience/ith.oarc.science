<span id="xi.xviii.xxxi-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xi.xviii.xxxi-p1.1"></span>Canon XXX.</span>

<span id="xi.xviii.xxxi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xi.xviii.xxxi-p2.1"></span>Since</span> the most religious bishops
of Egypt have postponed for the present their subscription to the letter
of the most holy Archbishop Leo, not because they oppose the Catholic
Faith, but because they declare that it is the custom in the Egyptian
diocese to do no such thing without the consent and order of their
Archbishop, and ask to be excused until the ordination of the new bishop
of the metropolis of Alexandria, it has seemed to us reasonable and kind
that this concession should be made to them, they remaining in their
official habit in the imperial city until the Archbishop of the
Metropolis of Alexandria shall have been ordained.

<span id="xi.xviii.xxxi-p3"></span>And the most religious Bishop
Paschasinus, representative of the Apostolic throne for Rome <span
id="fr_297"></span>[298](#fn_297.md) \], said:

<span id="xi.xviii.xxxi-p5"></span>If your authority suggests and
commands that any indulgence be shewn to them, let them give securities
that they will not depart from this city until the city of Alexandria
receives a Bishop.

<span id="xi.xviii.xxxi-p6"></span>And the most magnificent and glorious
judges, and the whole Senate, said:

<span id="xi.xviii.xxxi-p7"></span>Let the sentence of the most holy
Paschasinus be confirmed.

<span id="xi.xviii.xxxi-p8"></span>And therefore let them \[i.e., the
most religious Bishops of the Egyptians\] remain in their official
habit, either giving securities, if they can, or being bound by the
obligation of an oath.

<span id="xi.xviii.xxxi-p10"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xi.xviii.xxxi-p10.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XXX.</span>

<span id="xi.xviii.xxxi-p11"></span>*It is the custom of the Egyptians
that none subscribe* <span id="fr_298"></span>[299](#fn_298.md) *without
the permission of their Archbishop.  Wherefore they are not to be blamed
who did not subscribe the Epistle of the holy Leo until an Archbishop
had been appointed for them.*

<span id="xi.xviii.xxxi-p13"></span>As in the case of the last so-called
“canon” I have followed a usual Greek method, the wording departs but
little from that of the acts (*Vide* L. and C., *Conc*., Tom. IV., col.
517).

<span id="xi.xviii.xxxi-p14"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xi.xviii.xxxi-p14.1"></span>Hefele.</span>

<span id="xi.xviii.xxxi-p15"></span>This paragraph, like the previous
one, is not a proper canon, but a verbal repetition of a proposal made
in the fourth session by the imperial commissioners, improved by the
legate Paschasinus, and approved by the Synod.  Moreover, this so-called
canon is not found in the ancient collections, and was probably added to
the twenty-eight canons in the same manner and for the same reasons as
the preceding.

<span id="xi.xviii.xxxi-p16"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xi.xviii.xxxi-p16.1"></span>Bright.</span>

<span id="xi.xviii.xxxi-p17"></span>The council could insist with all
plainness on the duty of hearing before condemning (see on Canon XXIX.);
yet on this occasion <span id="page_292">p. 292</span> <span
id="xi.xviii.xxxi-Page_292"></span>bishop after bishop gave vent to
harsh unfeeling absolutism, the only excuse for which consists in the
fact that the outrages of the Latrocinium were fresh in their minds, and
that three of the Egyptian supplicants, whom they were so eager to
terrify or crush, had actually supported Dioscorus on the tragical
August 8, 449.  It was not in human nature to forget this; but the
result is a blot on the history of the Council of Chalcedon.
