<span id="xvi.xiv.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xvi.xiv.xii-p1.1"></span>Canon XII.</span>

<span id="xvi.xiv.xii-p2"></span>That a Bishop or Hegumenos ought not to
alienate any part of the suburban estate of the church.

<span id="xvi.xiv.xii-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xvi.xiv.xii-p3.1"></span>If</span> bishop or hegumenos is found
alienating any part of the farm lands of the bishoprick or monastery
into the hands of secular princes, or surrendering them to any other
person, such act is null according to the canon of the holy Apostles,
which says:  “Let the bishop take care of all the Church’s goods, and
let him administer the same according as in the sight of God.”  It is
not lawful for him to appropriate any part himself, or to confer upon
his relations the things which belong to God.  If they are poor let them
be helped among the poor; but let them not be used as a pretext for
smuggling away the Church’s property.  And if it be urged that the land
is only a loss and yields no profit, the place is not on that account to
be given to the secular rulers, who are in the neighbourhood; but let it
be given to clergymen or husbandmen.  And if they have resorted to
dishonest craft, so that the ruler has bought the land from the
husbandman or cleric, such transaction shall likewise be null, and the
land shall be restored to the bishoprick or monastery.  And the bishop
or hegumenos doing this shall be turned out, the bishop from his
bishoprick and the hegumenos from his monastery, as those who wasted
what they did not gather.

<span id="xvi.xiv.xii-p5"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xvi.xiv.xii-p5.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XII.</span>

<span id="xvi.xiv.xii-p6"></span>According to what seemed good to the
Holy Apostles, any act of alienation of the goods of a diocese or of a
monastery made by the bishop, or by the superior of the monastery, shall
be null.  And the Bishop or Superior who shall have done this shall be
expelled.

<span id="xvi.xiv.xii-p8"></span>As at the time of this Synod by the
favour of kings and princes the way was frequently open to
ecclesiastical dignities, clergymen might easily be induced through
ambition to make over to princes some part of the Church’s possessions,
if only by so doing they might arrive at the coveted preferment through
their patronage, and then desiring to make good this simoniacal promise,
they studied to transfer the church’s goods to their patrons; with
regard to these the present decree of the synod was made.

<span id="xvi.xiv.xii-p9"></span>But because human ambition is cunning,
<span id="page_564">p. 564</span> <span
id="xvi.xiv.xii-Page_564"></span>and solicitously seeks a way of
attaining its ends, ambitious clerics tried by various colouring to give
a tone to and to palliate these translations of church-goods to princes
and magistrates, so that they might attain to that they aimed at by the
favour of said princes and magistrates.

<span id="xvi.xiv.xii-p10"></span>Two such pretexts the synod exposes
and rejects in the present canon.

<span id="xvi.xiv.xii-p11"></span>This canon is found in the *Corpus
Juris Canonici*, Pars II., Causa XII., Quæst. II., canon xix.
