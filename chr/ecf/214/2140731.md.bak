id="xvii.xi-p2.1"></span>The First Canonical Epistle of Our Holy Father
Basil, Archbishop of Cæsarea in Cappadocia to Amphilochius, Bishop of
Iconium. <span id="fr_595"></span>[596](#fn_595.md) </span>

<span id="xvii.xi-p4"></span>(*This Epistle, number ct xxxviij., is
found translated in Volume VIII. of the Second Series of the* Nicene and
Post-Nicene Fathers, *p.* 223 *et seqq*.)

<span id="xvii.xi-p5"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.xi-p5.1"></span>Canon I.</span>

<span id="xvii.xi-p6"></span>As to the question concerning the Puritans
the custom of every country is to be observed, since they who have
discussed this point are of various sentiments.  The \[baptism\] of the
Pepuzenes I make no account of, and I wonder that Dionysius the canonist
was of another mind.  The ancients speak of heresies, which entirely
break men off, and make them aliens from the faith.  Such are the
Manichæans, Valentinians, Marcionites and Pepuzenes, who sin against the
Holy Ghost, who baptize into the Father, Son and Montanus, or
Priscilla.  Schisms are caused by ecclesiastical disputes, and for
causes that are not incurable, and for differences concerning penance. 
The Puritans are such schismatics.  The ancients, viz. Cyprian and
Fermilian, put these, and the Encratites, and Hydroparastatæ, and
Apotactites, under the same condemnation; because they have no longer
the communication of the Holy Ghost, who have broken the succession. 
They who first made the departure had the spiritual gift; but by being
schismatics, they became laymen; and therefore they ordered those that
were baptized by them, and came over to the Church, to be purged by the
true baptism, as those that are baptized by laymen.  Because some in
Asia have otherwise determined, let \[their baptism\] be allowed:  but
not that of the Encratites; for they have altered their baptism, to make
themselves incapable of being received by the Church.  Yet custom and
the Fathers, that is bishops, who have the administration, must be
followed; for I am afraid of putting an impediment to the saved; while I
would raise fears in them concerning their baptism.  We are not to allow
their baptism, because they allow ours, but strictly to observe the
canons.  But let none be received without unction.  When we received
Zois and Saturninus to the Episcopal chair, we made, as it were, a canon
to receive those in communion with them.

<span id="xvii.xi-p7"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.xi-p7.1"></span>Canon II.</span>

<span id="xvii.xi-p8"></span>Let her that procures abortion undergo ten
years’ penance, whether the embryo were perfectly formed, or not.

<span id="xvii.xi-p9"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.xi-p9.1"></span>Canon III.</span>

<span id="xvii.xi-p10"></span>A deacon guilty of fornication, is
deposed, not excommunicated; for the ancient canon forbids a single
crime to be twice punished.  And further, a layman excommunicated may be
restored to the degree from which he falls, but a clergyman deposed
cannot.  Yet it is better to cure men of their sins by mortification,
and to execute the canon only in cases where we cannot reach what is
more perfect.

<span id="xvii.xi-p11"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.xi-p11.1"></span>Canon IV.</span>

<span id="xvii.xi-p12"></span>They that marry a second time, used to be
under penance a year or two.  They that marry a third time, three or
four years.  But we have a custom, that he who marries a third time be
under penance five years, not by canon, but tradition.  Half of this
time they are to be hearers, afterwards Co-standers; but to abstain from
the communion of the Good Thing, when they have shewed some fruit of
repentance.

<span id="xvii.xi-p13"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.xi-p13.1"></span>Canon V.</span>

<span id="xvii.xi-p14"></span>Heretics, upon their death-bed, giving
good signs of their conversion, to be received.

<span id="xvii.xi-p15"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.xi-p15.1"></span>Canon VI.</span>

<span id="xvii.xi-p16"></span>Let it not be counted a marriage, when one
belonging to the canon commits fornication, but let them be forced to
part. <span id="fr_596"></span>[597](#fn_596.md)

<span id="xvii.xi-p18"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.xi-p18.1"></span>Canon VII.</span>

<span id="xvii.xi-p19"></span>They who have committed sodomy with men or
brutes, murderers, wizards, adulterers, and idolaters, have been thought
worthy of the same punishment; therefore observe the same method with
these which you do with others.  We ought not to make any doubt of
receiving those who have repented thirty years for the uncleanness which
they committed through ignorance; for their ignorance pleads their
pardon, and their willingness in confessing it; therefore com<span
id="page_605">p. 605</span> <span id="xvii.xi-Page_605"></span>mand them
to be forthwith received, especially if they have tears to prevail on
your tenderness, and have \[since their lapse\] led such a life as to
deserve your compassion.

<span id="xvii.xi-p20"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.xi-p20.1"></span>Canon VIII.</span>

<span id="xvii.xi-p21"></span>He that kills another with a sword, or
hurls an axe at his own wife and kills her, is guilty of wilful murder;
not he who throws a stone at a dog, and undesignedly kills a man, or who
corrects one with a rod, or scourge, in order to reform him, or who
kills a man in his own defence, when he only designed to hurt him.  But
the man, or woman, is a murderer that gives a *philtrum*, if the man
that takes it die upon it; so are they who take medicines to procure
abortion; and so are they who kill on the highway, and rapparees.

<span id="xvii.xi-p22"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.xi-p22.1"></span>Canon IX.</span>

<span id="xvii.xi-p23"></span>Our Lord is equal, to the man and woman
forbidding divorce, save in case of fornication; but custom requires
women to retain their husbands, though they be guilty of fornication. 
The man deserted by his wife may take another, and though he were
deserted for adultery, yet St. Basil will be positive, that the other
woman who afterward takes him is guilty of adultery; but the wife is not
allowed this liberty.  And the man who deserts an innocent wife is not
allowed to marry.

<span id="xvii.xi-p24"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.xi-p24.1"></span>Canon X.</span>

<span id="xvii.xi-p25"></span>That they who swear that they will not be
ordained, be not forced to break their oath.  Severus, Bishop of Masada,
who had ordained Cyriacus priest to a country church, subject to the
Bishop of Mesthia, is referred to the divine tribunal, upon his
pretending that he did it by surprise.  Cyriacus had upon his
ordination, been forced, contrary to canon, to swear that he would
continue in that country church; but the Bishop of Mesthia, to whom that
church properly belonged, forced him out.  St. Basil advises
Amphilochius to lay the country church to Masada, and make it subject to
Severus, and to permit Cyriacus to return to it and save his oath; and
by this means he supposes that Longinus, the lord of that country, would
be prevailed upon to alter his resolution of laying that church
desolate, as he declared he would upon Cyriacus’s expulsion.

<span id="xvii.xi-p26"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.xi-p26.1"></span>Canon XI.</span>

<span id="xvii.xi-p27"></span>He that is guilty of involuntary murder,
shall do eleven years’ penance—that is, if the murdered person, after he
had here received the wound, do again go abroad, and yet afterward die
of the wound.

<span id="xvii.xi-p28"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.xi-p28.1"></span>Canon XII.</span>

<span id="xvii.xi-p29"></span>The canon excludes from the ministry those
who are guilty of digamy.

<span id="xvii.xi-p30"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.xi-p30.1"></span>Canon XIII.</span>

<span id="xvii.xi-p31"></span>Our fathers did not think that killing in
war was murder; yet I think it advisable for such as have been guilty of
it to forbear communion three years.

<span id="xvii.xi-p32"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.xi-p32.1"></span>Canon XIV.</span>

<span id="xvii.xi-p33"></span>An usurer, giving his unjust gain to the
poor, and renouncing his love of money, may be admitted into the clergy.

<span id="xvii.xi-p34"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.xi-p34.1"></span>Canons XV. and XVI.</span>

<span id="xvii.xi-p35"></span>Not properly canons, but explications of
Scripture, and therefore neither Balsamon, nor Aristenus, regard them as
canons.

<span id="xvii.xi-p3"></span> These canons of St. Basil’s are annotated
by Zonaras, Balsamon and Aristenus, and of them there is also the
Ancient Epitome which will be found in Beveridge (*Synod*., Tom. II., p.
47).  Johnson gives the date of these canons as later than the year 370.

<span id="xvii.xi-p17"></span> Johnson adds this note, “i.e. a
clergyman, Monk, Deaconess, etc.”  See *Can. Nic*., xvj.
