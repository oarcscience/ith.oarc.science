<span id="xiv.iii.lxxxvi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.lxxxvi-p2.1"></span>We</span> have received from the
Scriptures that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word shall
be established.  Therefore we decree that slaves who are manumitted by
their masters in the presence of three witnesses shall enjoy that
honour; for they being present at the time will add strength and
stability to the liberty given, and they will bring it to pass that
faith will be kept in those things which they now witness were done in
their presence.

before two witnesses shall be free.*
