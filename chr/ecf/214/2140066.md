<span id="viii.iii.iii.v-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.v-p2.1"></span>As</span> many, however, as went up in
mourning attire and sat down and ate, weeping throughout the whole
entertainment, if they have fulfilled the three years as prostrators,
let them be received without oblation; and if they did not eat, let them
be prostrators two years, and in the third year let them communicate
without oblation, so that in the fourth year they may be received into
full communion.  But the bishops have the right, after considering the
character of their conversion, either to deal with them more leniently,
or to extend the time.  But, first of all, let their life before and
since be thoroughly examined, and let the indulgence be determined
accordingly.

<span id="viii.iii.iii.v-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.v-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon V.</span>

<span id="viii.iii.iii.v-p5"></span>Those who have gone up in mourning
weeds, and have eaten with tears, shall be prostrators for three years;
but if they have not eaten, then for two years.  And according to their
former and after life, whether good or evil, they shall find the bishop
gentle or severe.

<span id="viii.iii.iii.v-p6"></span>Herbst and Routh have been followed
by many in supposing that “oblation” (<span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.v-p6.1"></span>προσφορά</span>) in this canon refers to
the sacrament of the altar.  But this seems to be a mistake, as the word
while often used to denote the whole act of the celebration of the Holy
Eucharist, is not used to mean the receiving alone of that sacrament.

<span id="viii.iii.iii.v-p7"></span>Suicer (*Thesaurus* s.v. <span
class="Greek"><span id="viii.iii.iii.v-p7.1"></span>προσφορά</span>)
translates “They may take part in divine worship, but not actively,”
that is, “they may not mingle their offerings with those of the
faithful.”

<span id="viii.iii.iii.v-p8"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.v-p8.1"></span>Hefele.</span>

<span id="viii.iii.iii.v-p9"></span>But as those who cannot present
their offerings during the sacrifice are excluded from the communion,
the complete meaning of the canon is:  “They may be present at divine
service, but may neither offer nor communicate with the faithful.”
