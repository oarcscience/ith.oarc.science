id="xii.iii-p1.1"></span>Excursus on the Genuineness of the Acts of the
Fifth Council.</span>

<span id="xii.iii-p2"></span>Some suspicion has arisen with regard to
how far the acts of the Fifth Ecumenical Council may be relied upon. 
Between the Roman Manuscript printed by Labbe and the Paris manuscript
found in Mansi there are considerable variations and, strange to say,
some of the most injurious things to the memory of Pope Vigilius are
found only in the Paris manuscript.  Moreover we know that the
manuscript kept in the patriarchal archives at Constantinople had been
tampered with during the century that elapsed before the next Ecumenical
Synod, for at that council the forgeries and interpolations were exposed
by the Papal Legates.

<span id="xii.iii-p3"></span>At the <span class="sc"><span
id="xii.iii-p3.1"></span>XIV</span>th Session of that synod the
examination of the genuineness of the acts of the Second Council of
Constantinople was resumed.  It had been begun at the <span
class="sc"><span id="xii.iii-p3.2"></span>XII</span>th Session.  Up to
this time only two <span class="sc"><span
id="xii.iii-p3.3"></span>mss.</span> had been used, now the librarian of
the patriarchate presented a third <span class="sc"><span
id="xii.iii-p3.4"></span>ms.</span> which he had found in the archives,
and swore that neither himself nor any other so far as he knew had made
any change in these <span class="sc"><span
id="xii.iii-p3.5"></span>mss.</span>  These were then compared and it
was found that the two first agreed in containing the pretended letter
of Mennas to Pope Vigilius, and the two writings addressed by Vigilius
to Justinian and Theodora; but that none of these were found in the
third <span class="sc"><span id="xii.iii-p3.6"></span>ms.</span>  It was
further found that the documents in dispute were in a different hand
from the rest of the <span class="sc"><span
id="xii.iii-p3.7"></span>ms.</span>, and that in the first book of the
parchment <span class="sc"><span id="xii.iii-p3.8"></span>ms.</span>,
three quarternions had been inserted, and in the second book between
quarternions 15 and 16, four unpaged leaves had been placed.  So too the
second <span class="sc"><span id="xii.iii-p3.9"></span>ms.</span> had
been tampered with.  The council inserted these particulars in a decree,
and ordered that “these additions must be quashed in both <span
class="sc"><span id="xii.iii-p3.10"></span>mss.</span>, and marked with
an obelus, and the falsifiers must be smitten with anathema.”  Finally
the council cried out, “Anathema to the pretended letters of Mennas and
Vigilius!  Anathema to the forger of Acts!  Anathema to all who teach,
etc.”

<span id="xii.iii-p4"></span>From all this it would seem that the
substantial accuracy of the rest of the acts have been established by
the authority of the Sixth Synod, and Hefele and all recent scholars
follow Mansi’s Paris <span class="sc"><span
id="xii.iii-p4.1"></span>ms.</span>

<span id="xii.iii-p5"></span>It may be well here to add that a most
thorough-going attack upon the acts has been made in late years by
Professor Vincenzi, in defence of Pope Vigilius and of Origen.  The
reader is referred to his writings on the subject:  *In Sancti Gregorii
Nysseni et Originis scripta et doctrinam nova defensio; Vigil., Orig.,
Justin. triumph., in Synod V*. (Romæ, 1865.)  The *Catholic Dictionary*
frankly says that this is “an attempt to deny the most patent facts, and
treat some of the chief documents as forgeries,” and “unworthy of
serious notice.” <span id="fr_300"></span>[301](#fn_300.md)
