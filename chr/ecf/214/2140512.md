<span id="xv.iii.iv.xviii-Page_431"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xv.iii.iv.xviii-p1.1"></span>Canon XVII.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.iv.xviii-p2"></span>(*Greek*.)

<span id="xv.iii.iv.xviii-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iii.iv.xviii-p3.1"></span>At</span> the suggestion moreover of
our brother Olympius, <span id="fr_400"></span>[401](#fn_400) we are
pleased to decree this also:  That if a bishop suffer violence and is
unjustly cast out either on account of his discipline or for his
confession of \[the faith of\] the Catholic Church or for his defence of
the truth, and, fleeing from danger, although innocent and devout \[or,
innocent and being under charge of high treason\], comes to another
city, let him not be forbidden to stay there until he is restored or
until deliverance can be found from the violence and injustice that have
been done him.  For it would be harsh indeed and most oppressive that
one who has suffered unjust expulsion should not be harboured by us; as
such a man ought to be received with the greatest consideration and
cordiality.\*

<span id="xv.iii.iv.xviii-p5"></span>All said:  This also is our
pleasure.

<span id="xv.iii.iv.xviii-p6"></span>(*Latin*.)

<span id="xv.iii.iv.xviii-p7"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iii.iv.xviii-p7.1"></span>At</span> the suggestion of our brother
Olympius, we are pleased to decree this also:  That if any suffer
violence and is unjustly cast out on account of his discipline and his
Catholic confession or for his defence of the truth, and, fleeing from
dangers, although innocent and devout, comes to another city, let him
not be forbidden to stay there until he can return or his wrong has been
redressed.  For it is harsh and unfeeling that he who is suffering
persecution should not be received; indeed, great cordiality and
abundant consideration should be shown him.

<span id="xv.iii.iv.xviii-p8"></span>All the synod said:  All that has
been decreed the Catholic Church spread abroad throughout all the world
will preserve and maintain.

<span id="xv.iii.iv.xviii-p9"></span>And all the bishops of the various
provinces who had assembled subscribed thus:

<span id="xv.iii.iv.xviii-p10"></span>I, N., bishop of the city of N.
and the province of N., so believe as above is written.

<span id="xv.iii.iv.xviii-p12"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iii.iv.xviii-p12.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XVII.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.iv.xviii-p13"></span>If a bishop goes into another
province after he has been unjustly expelled from his own, he should be
received, until he has been delivered from his injury.

<span id="xv.iii.iv.xviii-p14"></span>This is Canon XXI. of the Latin
and the last.

<span id="xv.iii.iv.xviii-p16"></span>St. Gregory seems to have had this
canon in mind when he wrote to the bishops of Illyria (Lib. III.,
*Epist*. xliij.), who had been cast out by the hostility of the
barbarians.
