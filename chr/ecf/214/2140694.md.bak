<span id="xvi.xiv.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xvi.xiv.viii-p1.1"></span>Canon VIII.</span>

<span id="xvi.xiv.viii-p2"></span>That Hebrews ought not to be received
unless they have been converted in sincerity of heart.

<span id="xvi.xiv.viii-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xvi.xiv.viii-p3.1"></span>Since</span> certain, erring in the
superstitions of the Hebrews, have thought to mock at Christ our God,
and feigning to be converted to the religion of Christ do deny him, and
in private and secretly keep the Sabbath and observe other Jewish
customs, we decree that such persons be not received to communion, nor
to prayers, nor into the Church; but let them be openly Hebrews
according to their religion, and let them not bring their children to
baptism, nor purchase or possess a slave.  But if any of them, out of a
sincere heart and in faith, is converted and makes profession with his
whole heart, setting at naught their customs and observances, and so
that others may be convinced and converted, such an one is to be
received and baptized, and his children likewise; and let them be taught
to take care to hold aloof from the ordinances of the Hebrews.  But if
they will not do this, let them in no wise be received.

<span id="xvi.xiv.viii-p5"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xvi.xiv.viii-p5.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon VIII.</span>

<span id="xvi.xiv.viii-p6"></span>Hebrews must not be received unless
they are manifestly converted with sincerity of heart.

<span id="xvi.xiv.viii-p7"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xvi.xiv.viii-p7.1"></span>Hefele.</span>

<span id="xvi.xiv.viii-p8"></span>The Greek commentators Balsamon and
Zonaras understood the words “nor to baptize their children” to mean,
“these seeming Christians may not ‘baptize their own children,’” because
they only seem to be Christians.  But parents were never allowed to
baptize their own children, and the true sense of the words in question
comes out clearly from the second half of the canon.
