<p class="c18"><a name="xiv.iii.xlvi-p2"></A><span class="sc"><a name="xiv.iii.xlvi-p2.1"></A>Whereas</span> we understand that in some monasteries of women those who are about to be clothed with the sacred habit are first adorned in silks and garments of all kinds, and also with gold and jewels, by those who bring them thither, and that they thus approach the altar and are there stripped of such a display of wealth, and that immediately thereafter the blessing of their habit takes place, and they are clothed with the black robe; we decree that henceforth this shall not be done.&#160; For it is not lawful for her who has already of her own free will put away every <A NAME="page_387"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 387</FONT></A> <a name="xiv.iii.xlvi-Page_387"></A>delight of life, and has embraced that method of life which is according to God, and has confirmed it with strong and stable reasons, and so has come to the monastery, to recall to memory the things which they had already forgotten, things of this world which perisheth and passeth away.&#160; For thus they raise in themselves doubts, and are disturbed in their souls, like the tossing waves, turning hither and thither.&#160; Moreover, they should not give bodily evidence of heaviness of heart by weeping, but if a few tears drop from their eyes, as is like enough to be the case, they may be supposed by those who see them to have flowed <span class="Greek"><a name="xiv.iii.xlvi-p2.2"></A>&#956;&#8052; &#956;&#8118;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#957;</span> on account of their affection (<span class="Greek"><a name="xiv.iii.xlvi-p2.3"></A>&#948;&#953;&#945;&#952;&#8051;&#963;&#949;&#969;&#962;</span>, affectionem) for the ascetic struggle rather than (<span class="Greek"><a name="xiv.iii.xlvi-p2.4"></A>&#7970;</span>) because they are quitting the world and worldly things.</p>
