id="viii.vi.iii-p1.1"></span>The Synodal Letter.</span>

<span id="viii.vi.iii-p2"></span>(*Found in Labbe and Cossart,*
Concilia, Tom. II., col. 559.*  It really is no part of the canons, but
I have placed it here, because, as Labbe notes, “it is usually prefixed
to the canons in the Greek*.”)

<span id="viii.vi.iii-p3"></span>The holy and most peaceful Synod which
has been gathered together in Antioch from the provinces of Cœle-Syria,
Phœnicia, Palestine, Arabia, Mesopotamia, Cilicia, and Isauria; <span
id="fr_165"></span>[166](#fn_165.md) to our like-minded and holy fellow
Ministers in every Province, health in the Lord.

<span id="viii.vi.iii-p5"></span>The grace and truth of our Lord and
Saviour Jesus Christ hath regarded the holy Church of the Antiochians,
and, by joining it together with unity of mind and concord and the
Spirit of Peace, hath likewise bettered many other things; and in them
all this betterment is wrought by the assistance of the holy and
peace-giving Spirit.  Wherefore, that which after much examination and
investigation, was unanimously agreed upon by us bishops, who coming out
of various Provinces have met together in Antioch, we have now brought
to your knowledge; trusting in the grace of Christ and in the Holy
Spirit of Peace, that ye also will agree with us and stand by us as far
as in you lies, striving with us in prayers, and being even more united
with us, following the Holy Spirit, uniting in our definitions, and
decreeing the same things as we; ye, in the concord which proceedeth of
the Holy Spirit, sealing and confirming what has been determined.

<span id="viii.vi.iii-p6"></span>Now the Canons of the Church which have
been settled are hereto appended.

<span id="viii.vi.iii-p4"></span> Hefele thinks this list of provinces
is probably an interpolation.  In the Latin version this letter is
followed by the names of the bishops.
