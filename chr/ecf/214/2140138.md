Assembled at Antioch in Syria. <span id="fr_166"></span>[167](#fn_166.md)

<span id="viii.vi.iv.i-p3"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="viii.vi.iv.i-p3.1"></span>Canon I.</span>

<span id="viii.vi.iv.i-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.vi.iv.i-p4.1"></span>Whosoever</span> shall presume to set
aside the decree of the holy and great Synod which was assembled at Nice
in the presence of the pious Emperor Constantine, beloved of God,
concerning the holy and salutary feast of Easter; if they shall
obstinately persist in opposing what was \[then\] rightly ordained, let
them be excommunicated and cast out of the Church; this is said
concerning the laity.  But if any one of those who preside in the
Church, whether he be bishop, presbyter, or deacon, shall presume, after
this decree, to exercise his own private judgment to the subversion of
the people and to the disturbance of the churches, by observing Easter
\[at the same time\] with the Jews, the holy Synod decrees that he shall
thenceforth be an alien from the Church, as one who not only heaps sins
upon himself, but who is also the cause of destruction and subversion to
many; and it deposes not only such persons themselves from their
ministry, but those also who after their deposition shall presume to
communicate with them.  And the deposed shall be deprived even of that
external honour, of which the holy Canon and God’s priesthood partake.

<span id="viii.vi.iv.i-p6"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.vi.iv.i-p6.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon I.</span>

<span id="viii.vi.iv.i-p7"></span>Whoso endeavours to change the lawful
tradition of Easter, if he be a layman let him be excommunicated, but if
a cleric let him be cast out of the Church.

<span id="viii.vi.iv.i-p8"></span>The connexion between these canons of
Antioch and the Apostolical Canons is so evident and so intimate that I
shall note it, in each case, for the convenience of the student.

<span id="viii.vi.iv.i-p9"></span>Zonaras and Balsamon both point out
that from this first canon it is evident that the Council of Nice did
take action upon the Paschal question, and in a form well known to the
Church.

<span id="viii.vi.iv.i-p10"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.vi.iv.i-p10.1"></span>Van Espen.</span>

<span id="viii.vi.iv.i-p11"></span>From this canon it appears that the
fathers did not deem laymen deserving of excommunication who merely
broke the decrees, but only those who “obstinately persist in opposing
the decrees sanctioned and received by the Church; for by their refusal
to obey they are attempting to overturn.”  And this being the case, why
should such not be repelled or cast forth from the Church as rebels?

<span id="viii.vi.iv.i-p12"></span>Finally this Canon proves that not
only bishops and presbyters, but also deacons were reckoned among them
who, “preside in the Church.”  An argument in favour of the opinion that
the deacons of that time were entrusted with hierarchical functions.

<span id="viii.vi.iv.i-p13"></span>It is curious that as a matter of
fact the entire clergy and people of the West fell under the anathema of
this canon in 1825, when they observed Easter on the same day as the
Jews.  This was owing to the adoption of the Gregorian calendar, and
this misfortune while that calendar is followed it is almost impossible
to prevent. <span id="fr_167"></span>[168](#fn_167.md)

id="viii.vi.iv.i-p1.2"></span>

<span id="viii.vi.iv.i-p2"></span> This is the title in the codices of
Zonaras; the Parisian edition of Balsamon simply reads “The Synod at
Antioch.”  The Bodleian <span class="sc"><span
id="viii.vi.iv.i-p2.1"></span>ms</span>. reads “Canons of the Synod at
Antioch in Syria.”

<span id="viii.vi.iv.i-p14"></span> There seems but little doubt that
the Gregorian Calendar will be introduced before many years into Russia.
