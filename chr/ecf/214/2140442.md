<span id="xiv.iii.lix-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.lix-p2.1"></span>None</span> of those who are in the order
of laymen may distribute the Divine Mysteries to himself if a bishop,
presbyter, or deacon be present.  But whoso shall dare to do such a
thing, as acting contrary to what has been determined shall be cut off
for a week and thenceforth let him learn not to think of himself more
highly than he ought to think.

<span id="xiv.iii.lix-p5"></span>A layman shall not communicate
himself.  Should he do so, let him be cut off for a week.

<span id="xiv.iii.lix-p7"></span>It is well known that in the first
centuries it was customary that the Holy Eucharist should be taken back
by the faithful to their houses; and that at home they received it at
their own hands.  It is evident that this was what was done by the
Anchorites and monks who lived in the deserts, as may be seen proved by
Cardinal Bona.  (*De Rebus Liturg*., Lib. II., cap. xvij.).  From this
domestic communion it is easily seen how the abuse arose which is
condemned in this canon.
