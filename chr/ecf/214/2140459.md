id="xiv.iii.lxxvi-p2.1"></span>We</span> will that those whose office it
is to sing in the churches do not use undisciplined vociferations, nor
force nature to shouting, nor adopt any of those modes which are
incongruous and unsuitable for the church:  but that they offer the
psalmody to God, who is the observer of secrets, with great attention
and compunction.  For the Sacred Oracle taught that the Sons of Israel
were to be pious. <span id="fr_381"></span>[382](#fn_381.md)

<span id="xiv.iii.lxxvi-p6"></span>Inordinate vociferation of the psalms
is not allowed, nor he that adopts things unsuited to the churches.

<span id="xiv.iii.lxxvi-p7"></span>This question of the character of
church-music was one early discussed among Christians, and (long before
the time of this synod), St. Augustine, in debating as to whether the
chanting or the reading of the psalter was the more edifying, concludes,
“when the psalms are chanted with a voice and most suitable modulation
(*liquida voce et convenientissima modulatione*), I recognize that there
is great utility in the practice,” and further on he adds that singing
is to be the rather approved, because “by the delight given to the ears
the infirm soul is worked up to pious aspirations.”  (*Confess*. Lib.
x., cap. xxxiij.).
