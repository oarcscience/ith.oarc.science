id="xiv.iii.xlvii-p1.1"></span>Canon XLVI.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.xlvii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.xlvii-p2.1"></span>Those</span> women who choose the ascetic
life and are settled in monasteries may by no means go forth of them. 
If, however, any inexorable necessity compels them, let them do so with
the blessing and permission of her who is mother superior; and even then
they must not go forth alone, but with some old women who are eminent in
the monastery, and at the command of the lady superior.  But it is not
at all permitted that they should stop outside.

<span id="xiv.iii.xlvii-p3"></span>And men also who follow the monastic
life let them on urgent necessity go forth with the blessing of him to
whom the rule is entrusted.

<span id="xiv.iii.xlvii-p4"></span>Wherefore, those who transgress that
which is now decreed by us, whether they be men or women, are to be
subjected to suitable punishments.

<span id="xiv.iii.xlvii-p7"></span>*A nun shall not go out of her
convent without the consent of her superior, nor shall she go alone but
with an older one of the order.  It is in no case permitted to her to
spend the night outside.  The same is the case with a monk; he cannot go
out of the monastery without the consent of the superior.*
