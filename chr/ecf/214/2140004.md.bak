<span id="iii.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="iii.ii-p1.1"></span>II.  Concerning Ecumenical Councils in
General.</span>

<span id="iii.ii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iii.ii-p2.1"></span>An</span> Ecumenical Synod may be defined as a
synod the decrees of which have found acceptance by the Church in the
whole world. <span id="fr_1"></span>[2](#fn_1.md)   It is not necessary to
make a council ecumenical that the number of bishops present should be
large, there were but 325 at Nice, and 150 at I. Constantinople; it is
<span id="page_xii">p. xii</span> <span id="iii.ii-Page_xii"></span>not
necessary that it should be assembled with the intention of its being
ecumenical, such was not the case with I. Constantinople; it is not
necessary that all parts of the world should have been represented or
even that the bishops of such parts should have been invited.  All that
is necessary is that its decrees find ecumenical acceptance afterwards,
and its ecumenical character be universally recognized.

<span id="iii.ii-p4"></span>The reader will notice that in the foregoing
I have not proceeded from the theological foundation of what an
Ecumenical Synod should be (with this question the present volume has
nothing to do), but from a consideration of the historical question as
to what the Seven Councils have in common, which distinguishes them from
the other councils of the Christian Church.

<span id="iii.ii-p5"></span>And here it is well to note that there have
been many “General Councils” which have not been “Ecumenical.”  It is
true that in ordinary parlance we often use the expressions as
interchangeable, but such really is not the case.  There are but seven
universally recognized and undisputed “Ecumenical Councils”; on the
other hand, the number of “General Councils” is very considerable, and
as a matter of fact of these last several very large ones fell into
heresy.  It is only necessary to mention as examples the Latrocinium and
the spurious “Seventh Council,” held by the iconoclastic heretics.  It
is therefore the mere statement of an historical fact to say that
General Councils have erred.

<span id="iii.ii-p6"></span>The Ecumenical Councils claimed for
themselves an immunity from error in their doctrinal and moral teaching,
resting such claim upon the promise of the presence and guidance of the
Holy Ghost.  The Council looked upon itself, not as revealing any new
truth, but as setting forth the faith once for all delivered to the
Saints, its decisions therefore were in themselves ecumenical, as being
an expression of the mind of the whole body of the faithful both
clerical and lay, the *sensus communis* of the Church.  And by the then
teaching of the Church that ecumenical consensus was considered free
from the suspicion of error, guarded, (as was believed,) by the Lord’s
promise that the gates of hell should not prevail against his Church. 
This then is what Catholics mean when they affirm the infallibility of
Ecumenical Councils.  Whether this opinion is true or false is a
question outside the scope of the present discussion.  It was necessary,
however, to state that these Councils looked upon themselves as divinely
protected in their decisions from error in faith and morals, lest the
reader should otherwise be at a loss to understand the anathematisms
which follow the decrees, and which indeed would be singularly out of
place, if the decrees which they thus emphatically affirm were supposed
to rest only upon human wisdom and speculation, instead of upon divine
authority.

<span id="iii.ii-p7"></span>Theologians consider that the decisions of
Ecumenical Councils, like all juridical decrees, must be construed
strictly, and that only the point at issue must be looked upon as
decided.  The *obiter dicta* of so august a body are no doubt of the
greatest weight, but yet they have no claim to be possessed of that
supreme authority which belongs to the definition of the particular
point under consideration. <span id="fr_2"></span>[3](#fn_2.md)

<span id="iii.ii-p9"></span>The Seven Ecumenical Councils were all
called together at the commandment and will of Princes; without any
knowledge of the matter on the part of the Pope in one case at least
(1st Constantinople) <span id="fr_3"></span>[4](#fn_3.md) ; without any
consultation with him in the case of I. Nice, so far as we know <span
id="fr_4"></span>[5](#fn_4.md) ; and contrary to his expressed desire in at
least the case of Chalcedon, when he only gave a reluctant consent after
the Emperor Marcian had already convoked the synod.  From this it is
historically evident that Ecumenical Councils can be summoned without
either the knowledge or consent of the See of Rome.

<span id="iii.ii-p12"></span>In the history of the Christian Church,
especially at a later period in connection with the Great Schism, much
discussion has taken place among the learned as to the relative powers
of a General Council and of the Pope.  It will be remembered by everyone
that the superior authority of the council was not only taught, but on
one occasion <span id="page_xiii">p. xiii</span> <span
id="iii.ii-Page_xiii"></span>acted on, by a council, but this is outside
of the period covered by the Seven Ecumenical Synods, and I shall
therefore only discuss the relations of these seven synods to the Roman
See.  And in the first place it is evident that no council has ever been
received as ecumenical which has not been received and confirmed by the
Roman Pontiff.  But, after all, this is only saying that no council has
been accepted as ecumenical which has not been ecumenically received,
for it must be remembered that there was but one Patriarchate for the
whole West, that of Rome; and this is true to all intents and purposes,
whether or no certain sections had extrapatriarchal privileges, and were
“auto-cephalous.”

<span id="iii.ii-p13"></span>But it would be giving an entirely unfair
impression of the matter to the reader were he left to suppose that this
necessity for Rome’s confirmation sprang necessarily from any idea of
Rome’s infallibility.  So far as appears from any extant document, such
an idea was as unknown in the whole world then as it is in four of the
five patriarchates to-day.  And it should be borne in mind that the
confirmation by the Emperor was sought for and spoken of in quite as
strong, if not stronger, terms.  Before passing to a particular
examination of what relation each of the Councils bore to the Roman See,
it may be well to note that while as an historical fact each of the
Seven Ecumenical Councils did eventually find acceptance at Rome, this
fact does not prove that such acceptance is necessary in the nature of
things.  If we can imagine a time when Rome is not in communion with the
greater part of the West, then it is quite possible to imagine that an
Ecumenical Council could be held whose decrees would (for the time
being) be rejected by the unworthy occupant of the Apostolic See.  I am
not asserting that such a state of affairs is possible from a
theological standpoint, but merely stating an historical contingency
which is perfectly within the range of imagination, even if cut off from
any practical possibility by the faith of some.

<span id="iii.ii-p14"></span>We now come to a consideration of how, by
its acts, each of the Seven Synods intimated its relation to the Roman
See:

<span id="iii.ii-p15"></span>1.  The First Council of Nice passed a
canon in which some at least of the Roman rights are evidently looked
upon as being exactly on the same plane as those of other metropolitans,
declaring that they rest upon “custom.”

<span id="iii.ii-p16"></span>It was the Emperor who originated this
council and called it together, if we may believe his own words and
those of the council; and while indeed it is possible that when the
Emperor did not preside in person, Hosius of Cordova may have done so
(even uniting the two Roman Presbyters who were the legates of the Roman
See with him), yet there is no evidence that anything of the kind ever
took place, and a pope, Felix III. (<span class="sc"><span
id="iii.ii-p16.1"></span>a.d.</span> 483–492), in his Fifth Epistle (*ad
Imp. Zen.*) declares that Eustathius, bishop of Antioch, presided at
this council. <span id="fr_5"></span>[6](#fn_5.md)

<span id="iii.ii-p18"></span>The matter, however, is of little moment as
no one would deny the right of the See of Rome to preside in a council
of the whole Church.

<span id="iii.ii-p19"></span>2.  The Second Ecumenical Council was
called together by the Emperor without the knowledge of the Roman
Pontiff.  Nor was he invited to be present.  Its first president was not
in communion at the time of its session with the Roman Church.  And,
without any recourse to the first of all the patriarchs, it passed a
canon changing the order of the patriarchates, and setting the new see
of Constantinople in a higher place than the other ancient
patriarchates, in fact immediately after Rome.  Of course Protestants
will consider this a matter of very minor importance, looking upon all
patriarchal divisions and rank and priority (the Papacy included) as of
a disciplinary character and as being *jure ecclesiastico,* and in no
way affecting doctrine, but any fair reading of the third canon of this
synod would seem plainly to assert that as the first rank of Rome rested
upon the fact of its being the capital city, so the new capital city
should have the second rank.  If this interpretation is correct it
affects very materially the Roman claim of *jure divino* primacy.

<span id="iii.ii-p20"></span>3.  Before the third of the Ecumenical
Synods was called to meet, Pope Celestine had already convicted
Nestorius of heresy and deposed and excommunicated him.  When <span
id="page_xiv">p. xiv</span> <span
id="iii.ii-Page_xiv"></span>subsequently the synod was assembled, and
before the papal legates had arrived, the Council met, treated Nestorius
as in good standing, entirely ignoring the sentence already given by
Rome, and having examined the case (after summoning him three times to
appear that he might be heard in his own defence), proceeded to sentence
Nestorius, and immediately published the sentence.  On the 10th of July
(more than a fortnight later), the papal legates having arrived, a
second session was held, at which they were told what had been done, all
of which they were good enough to approve of. <span
id="fr_6"></span>[7](#fn_6.md)

<span id="iii.ii-p22"></span>4.  The Council of Chalcedon refused to
consider the Eutychian matter as settled by Rome’s decision or to accept
Leo’s Tome without examination as to whether it was orthodox.  Moreover
it passed a canon at a session which the Papal legates refused to
attend, ratifying the order of the Patriarchates fixed at I.
Constantinople, and declaring that “the Fathers had very properly given
privileges to Old Rome as the imperial city, and that now they gave the
same (<span class="Greek"><span id="iii.ii-p22.1"></span>τὰ ἴσα
πρεσβεῖα</span>) privileges” to Constantinople as the seat of the
imperial government at that time.

<span id="iii.ii-p23"></span>5.  The fifth of the Ecumenical Synods
refused to receive any written doctrinal communication from the then
pope (Vigilius), took his name from the diptychs, and refused him
communion.

<span id="iii.ii-p24"></span>6.  The Third Council of Constantinople,
the sixth of the Ecumenical Synods, excommunicated Pope Honorius, who
had been dead for years, for holding and teaching the Monothelite
heresy.

<span id="iii.ii-p25"></span>7.  It is certain that the Pope had nothing
to do with the calling of the Seventh Synod, <span
id="fr_7"></span>[8](#fn_7.md) and quite possible that it was presided over
by Tarasius and not by the Papal legates.

<span id="iii.ii-p27"></span>Such is, in brief, the evidence which the
Ecumenical Councils give on the subject of what, for lack of a better
designation, may be called the Papal claims.  Under these circumstances
it may not be deemed strange that some extreme ultramontanists have
arrived at the conclusion that much of the acts and decisions as we have
them is spurious, or at least corrupted in an anti-papal direction. 
Vincenzi, who is the most learned of these writers, argues somewhat thus
“if the members of the Ecumenical Synods believed as we do to-day with
regard to the Papacy it is impossible that they should have acted and
spoken as they did, but we know they must have believed as we do, *ergo*
they did not so act or speak.”  The logic is admirable, but the truth of
the conclusion depends upon the truth of the minor premise.  The
forgeries would have been very extensive, and who were they done by? 
Forgeries, as the false decretals, to advance papal claims we are
unfortunately familiar with, but it is hard to imagine who could have
forged in Greek and Latin the acts of the Ecumenical Synods.  It is not
necessary to pursue the matter any further, perhaps its very mention was
uncalled for, but I wish to be absolutely fair, that no one may say that
any evidence has been suppressed. <span id="fr_8"></span>[9](#fn_8.md)

<span id="iii.ii-p3"></span> This was until the division of the East and
West the definition accepted by all the whole Christian world.  But
since the Church has been divided, while the East has kept to the old
definition and has not pretended to have held any Ecumenical Councils,
the Roman Church has made a new definition of the old term and has then
proceeded to hold a very considerable number of synods which she
recognizes as Ecumenical.  I say “a very considerable number,” for even
among Roman Catholic theologians there is much dispute as to the number
of these “Ecumenical Synods,” the decrees of which, like those of Trent
and the Vatican, have never been received by about half of the Christian
world, including four of the five patriarchates and of the fifth
patriarchate all the Anglican communion.  According to modern Roman
writers the definition of these non-ecumenically received Ecumenical
Synods is “Ecumenical councils are those to which the bishops and others
entitled to vote are convoked from the whole world under the Presidency
of the Pope or his legates, and the decrees of which, having received
Papal confirmation, bind all Christians.”  Addis and Arnold, *A Catholic
Dictionary, s. v*. Councils.  The reader will notice that by this
definition one at least (I. Constantinople), probably three, of the
seven undisputed Ecumenical Synods cease to be such.

<span id="iii.ii-p21"></span> Protestant Controversialists, as well as
others, have curious ways of stating historical events without any
regard to the facts of the case.  A notable instance of this is found in
Dr. Salmon’s *Infallibility of the Church* (p. 426 of the 2d Edition)
where we are told that “the only one of the great controversies in which
the Pope really did his part in teaching Christians what to believe was
the Eutychian controversy.  Leo the Great, instead of waiting, as Popes
usually do, till the question was settled, published his sentiments at
the beginning, and his letter to Flavian was adopted by the Council of
Chalcedon.  This is what would have always happened if God had really
made the Pope the guide to the Church.  But this case is quite
exceptional, resulting from the accident that Leo was a good theologian,
besides being a man of great vigour of character.  No similar influence
was exercised either by his predecessors or successors.”  This sentence
is not pleasant reading, for it is an awe-inspiring display of one of
two things, neither of which should be in the author of such a book.  We
need only remind the reader that Celestine had condemned Nestorius and
his teaching before the Council of Ephesus; that Honorius had written
letters defining the question with regard to the will or wills of the
Incarnate Son before the III. Council of Constantinople (which
excommunicated him as a heretic for these very letters); that Pope
Vigilius condemned the “Three Chapters” before the II. Council of
Constantinople; and that Gregory II. condemned the iconoclastic heresy
before the Seventh Synod, if the letters attributed to him be genuine
(which is not quite certain, as will be shewn in its proper place). 
Thus the only two great questions not decided, one way or another, by
the See of Rome before the meeting of a General Council were Arianism
and Macedonianism, and some have held (though mistakenly as is generally
thought) that Arius was condemned by a synod held at Rome before that of
Nice.

id="iii.ii-p27.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ii-p28"></span> The reader may easily satisfy himself on
this matter by reading the somewhat extensive works of Aloysius
Vincenzi, published in Rome in 1875 and thereabouts.
