<span id="xv.iv.iv.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.vii-p1.1"></span>Canon VI.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.vii-p2"></span>That the chrism should not be made by
presbyters.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.vii-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.vii-p3.1"></span>Fortunatus</span> the bishop, said:  In
former councils we remember that it was decreed that the chrism or the
reconciliation of penitents, as also the consecration of virgins be not
done by presbyters:  but should anyone be discovered to have done this,
what ought we to decree with regard to him?

<span id="xv.iv.iv.vii-p4"></span>Aurelius the bishop said:  Your
worthiness has heard the suggestion of our brother and fellow-bishop
Fortunatus; What answer will you give?

<span id="xv.iv.iv.vii-p5"></span><span id="page_446">p. 446</span>
<span id="xv.iv.iv.vii-Page_446"></span>And all the bishops replied: 
Neither the making of the chrism, nor the consecration of virgins, is to
be done by presbyters, nor is it permitted to a presbyter to reconcile
anyone in the public mass (*in publica missa*), this is the pleasure of
all of us.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.vii-p7"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.vii-p7.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon VI.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.vii-p8"></span>Let no presbyter make the chrism, nor
prepare the unction, nor consecrate virgins, nor publicly reconcile
anyone to communion.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.vii-p9"></span>This is Canon iij. of the Carthaginian
Synod under Genethlius, <span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.vii-p9.1"></span>a.d.</span> 387 or 390.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.vii-p11"></span>Not the chrism used upon persons at
their baptism, says the scholion in Bishop Beveridge’s *Annotation*, but
the Mystical Chrism, viz., that used at Confirmation; though neither was
the chrism used at baptism to be consecrated by Priests.  See Decr. of
Gelasius 6.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.vii-p12"></span>Du Pin observes, That this is one of
the first monuments where the name of “mass” occurs to signify the
public prayers, which the church made at offering the Eucharist.  And
let the reader observe, that there is no mention of the “mass” in the
copies which the Greeks made use of.  And further, he restrains the
meaning of the word “mass” too much, when he supposes that it denoted
the Communion Office only.
