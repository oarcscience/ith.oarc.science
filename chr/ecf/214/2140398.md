<span id="xiv.iii.xv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.xv-p2.1"></span>Let</span> the canon of our holy God-bearing
Fathers be confirmed in this particular also; that a presbyter be not
ordained before he is thirty years of age, even if he be a very worthy
man, but let him be kept back.  For our Lord Jesus Christ was baptized
and began to teach when he was thirty.  In like manner let no deacon be
ordained before he is twenty-five, nor a deaconess before she is forty.

<span id="xiv.iii.xv-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.xv-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XIV.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.xv-p5"></span>A presbyter thirty years of age, a
deacon twenty-five, and a deaconess forty.

<span id="xiv.iii.xv-p6"></span>Compare Canon XI. of Neocæsarea.

<span id="xiv.iii.xv-p7"></span>It may be interesting to note here that
by the law of the Roman Communion the canonical ages are as follows:

<span id="xiv.iii.xv-p8"></span>A subdeacon must have completed his
twenty-first year, a deacon his twenty-second, a priest his
twenty-fourth, and a bishop his thirtieth.  None of the inferior clergy
can hold a simple benefice before he has begun his fourteenth year. 
Ecclesiastical dignities, such as Cathedral canonries, cannot be
conferred on any who have not finished the twenty-second year.  A
benefice to which is attached a cure of souls can be given only to one
who is over twenty-four, and a diocese only to one who has completed his
thirtieth year.  (*Vide* Ferraris, *Bibliotheca Prompta*.)

<span id="xiv.iii.xv-p9"></span>In the Anglican Communion the ages are,
in England, for a bishop “fully thirty years of age,” for a priest
twenty-four, and for a deacon twenty-three: <span
id="fr_360"></span>[361](#fn_360.md)   and in the United States, for a
bishop thirty years of age, for a priest twenty-four, and for a deacon
twenty-one.

<span id="xiv.iii.xv-p10"></span> A faculty is allowed for earlier
ordination, but since 1804 only to be granted by the Archbishop of
Canterbury.  This limitation is, however, only of Parliamentary sanction
(44 Geo. III., ch. 43).
