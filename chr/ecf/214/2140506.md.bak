<span id="xv.iii.iv.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xv.iii.iv.xii-p1.1"></span>Canon XII.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.iv.xii-p2"></span>(*Greek*.)

<span id="xv.iii.iv.xii-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iii.iv.xii-p3.1"></span>Bishop</span> <span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iii.iv.xii-p3.2"></span>Hosius</span> said:  Since no case should
be left unprovided for, let this also be decreed. <span
id="fr_394"></span>[395](#fn_394.md)   Some of our brethren and
fellow-bishops are known to possess very little private property in the
cities in which they are placed as bishops, but have great possessions
in other places, with which they are, moreover, able to help the poor. 
I think then permission should be given them, if they are to visit their
estates and attend to the gathering of the harvest, to pass three
Sundays, that is, to stay for three weeks, on their estates, and to
assist at divine worship and celebrate the liturgy in the nearest church
in which a presbyter holds service, in order that they may not be seen
to be absent from worship, and in order that they may not come too
frequently to the <span id="page_427">p. 427</span> <span
id="xv.iii.iv.xii-Page_427"></span>city in which there is a bishop.  In
this way their private affairs will suffer no loss from their absence
and they will be seen to be clear from the charge of ambition and
arrogance.

<span id="xv.iii.iv.xii-p5"></span>All the bishops said:  This decree
also is approved by us.

<span id="xv.iii.iv.xii-p6"></span>(*Latin*.)

<span id="xv.iii.iv.xii-p7"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iii.iv.xii-p7.1"></span>Bishop</span> <span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iii.iv.xii-p7.2"></span>Hosius</span> said:  Since no case should
be left unprovided for \[let this also be decreed\].  There are some of
our brother-bishops, who do not reside in the city in which they are
appointed bishops, either because they have but little property there,
while they are known to have considerable estates elsewhere, or, it may
be, through affection for kith and kin and in complaisance to these. 
Let this much be permitted them, to go to their estates to superintend
and dispose of their harvest, and \[for this purpose\] to remain over
three Sundays, that is, for three weeks, if it be necessary, on their
estates; or else, if there is a neighbouring city in which there is a
presbyter, in order that they may not be seen to pass Sunday without
church, let them go thither, so that \[in this way\] neither will their
private affairs suffer loss from their absence, nor will they, by
frequent going to the city in which a bishop is resident, incur the
suspicion of ambition and place-seeking.  All said that this was
approved by them.

<span id="xv.iii.iv.xii-p9"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iii.iv.xii-p9.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XII.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.iv.xii-p10"></span>If a bishop has possessions outside
his diocese, and visits them, let him be careful not to remain there
more than three Lord’s days.  For thus his own flock will be enriched by
him, and he himself will avoid the charge of arrogance.

<span id="xv.iii.iv.xii-p11"></span>This is Canon XV. of the Latin.

<span id="xv.iii.iv.xii-p12"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iii.iv.xii-p12.1"></span>Van Espen.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.iv.xii-p13"></span>As Balsamon notes, this canon is an
appendix to that which goes before, and the context of the canon
indicates this clearly enough; for while the last canon decrees that no
bishop is to be absent from his diocese for more than three Lord’s days,
without grave necessity, in this canon a certain modification is
introduced with regard to certain bishops.

<span id="xv.iii.iv.xii-p14"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iii.iv.xii-p14.1"></span>Hefele.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.iv.xii-p15"></span>According to the Latin text of
Dionysius, it is:  “Some bishops do not reside in their Cathedral town,
etc.”  Isidore and the *Prisca*, however, are nearer the Greek text, as
instead of *resident* they more rightly read *possident*.
