id="xiv.iii.i-Page_359"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xiv.iii.i-p1.1"></span>The Canons of the Council in Trullo.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.i-p2"></span>(Labbe and Cossart, *Concilia*, Tom. VI.,
col. 1135 *et seqq*.)

<span id="xiv.iii.i-p3"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xiv.iii.i-p3.1"></span>Canon I.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.i-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.i-p4.1"></span>That</span> order is best of all which makes
every word and act begin and end in God.  Wherefore that piety may be
clearly set forth by us and that the Church of which Christ is the
foundation may be continually increased and advanced, and that it may be
exalted above the cedars of Lebanon; now therefore we, by divine grace
at the beginning of our decrees, define that the faith set forth by the
God-chosen Apostles who themselves had both seen and were ministers of
the Word, shall be preserved without any innovation, unchanged and
inviolate.

<span id="xiv.iii.i-p5"></span>Moreover the faith of the three hundred
and eighteen holy and blessed fathers who were assembled at Nice under
Constantine our Emperor, against the impious Arius, and the gentile
diversity of deity or rather (to speak accurately) multitude of gods
taught by him, who by the unanimous acknowledgment of the faithful
revealed and declared to us the consubstantiality of the Three Persons
comprehended in the Divine Nature, not suffering this faith to lie
hidden under the bushel of ignorance, but openly teaching the faithful
to adore with one worship the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost,
confuting and scattering to the winds the opinion of different grades,
and demolishing and overturning the puerile toyings fabricated out of
sand by the heretics against orthodoxy.

<span id="xiv.iii.i-p6"></span>Likewise also we confirm that faith which
was set forth by the one hundred and fifty fathers who in the time of
Theodosius the Elder, our Emperor, assembled in this imperial city,
accepting their decisions with regard to the Holy Ghost in assertion of
his godhead, and expelling the profane Macedonius (together with all
previous enemies of the truth) as one who dared to judge Him to be a
servant who is Lord, and who wished to divide, like a robber, the
inseparable unity, so that there might be no perfect mystery of our
faith.

<span id="xiv.iii.i-p7"></span>And together with this odious and
detestable contender against the truth, we condemn Apollinaris, priest
of the same iniquity, who impiously belched forth that the Lord assumed
a body unendowed with a soul, <span id="fr_341"></span>[342](#fn_341.md)
thence also inferring that his salvation wrought for us was imperfect.

<span id="xiv.iii.i-p9"></span>Moreover what things were set forth by
the two hundred God-bearing fathers in the city of Ephesus in the days
of Theodosius our Emperor, the son of Arcadius; these doctrines we
assent to as the unbroken strength of piety, teaching that Christ the
incarnate Son of God is one; and declaring that she who bare him without
human seed was the immaculate Ever-Virgin, glorifying her as literally
and in very truth the Mother of God.  We condemn as foreign to the
divine scheme the absurd division of Nestorius, who teaches that the one
Christ consists of a man separately and of the Godhead separately and
renews the Jewish impiety.

<span id="xiv.iii.i-p10"></span>Moreover we confirm that faith which at
Chalcedon, the Metropolis, was set forth in accordance with orthodoxy by
the six hundred and thirty God-approved fathers in the time of Marcian,
who was our Emperor, which handed down with a great and mighty voice,
even unto the ends of the earth, that the one Christ, the son of God, is
of two natures, and must be glorified <span
id="fr_342"></span>[343](#fn_342.md) in these two natures, and which cast
forth from the sacred precincts of the Church as a black pestilence to
be avoided, Eutyches, babbling stupidly and inanely, and teaching that
the great mystery of the incarnation (<span class="Greek"><span
id="xiv.iii.i-p11.1"></span>οἰκονωμίας</span>) was perfected in thought
only.  And together with him also Nestorius and Dioscorus of whom the
former was the defender and champion of the division, the latter of the
confusion \[of the two natures in the one Christ\], both of whom fell
away from the divergence of their impiety to a common depth of perdition
and denial of God.

<span id="xiv.iii.i-p12"></span><span id="page_360">p. 360</span> <span
id="xiv.iii.i-Page_360"></span>Also we recognize as inspired by the
Spirit the pious voices of the one hundred and sixty-five God-bearing
fathers who assembled in this imperial city in the time of our Emperor
Justinian of blessed memory, and we teach them to those who come after
us; for these synodically anathematized and execrated Theodore of
Mopsuestia (the teacher of Nestorius), and Origen, and Didymus, and
Evagrius, all of whom reintroduced feigned Greek myths, and brought back
again the circlings of certain bodies and souls, and deranged turnings
\[or transmigrations\] to the wanderings or dreamings of their minds,
and impiously insulting the resurrection of the dead.  Moreover \[they
condemned\] what things were written by Theodoret against the right
faith and against the Twelve Chapters of blessed Cyril, and that letter
which is said to have been written by Ibas.

<span id="xiv.iii.i-p13"></span>Also we agree to guard untouched the
faith of the Sixth Holy Synod, which first assembled in this imperial
city in the time of Constantine, our Emperor, of blessed memory, which
faith received still greater confirmation from the fact that the pious
Emperor ratified with his own signet that which was written for the
security of future generations.  This council taught that we should
openly profess our faith that in the incarnation of Jesus Christ, our
true God, there are two natural wills or volitions and two natural
operations; and condemned by a just sentence those who adulterated the
true doctrine and taught the people that in the one Lord Jesus Christ
there is but one will and one operation; to wit, Theodore of Pharan,
Cyrus of Alexandria, Honorius of Rome, Sergius, Pyrrhus, Paul and Peter,
who were bishops of this God-preserved city; Macarius, who was bishop of
Antioch; Stephen, who was his disciple, and the insane Polychronius,
depriving them henceforth from the communion of the body of Christ our
God.

<span id="xiv.iii.i-p14"></span>And, to say so once for all, we decree
that the faith shall stand firm and remain unsullied until the end of
the world as well as the writings divinely handed down and the teachings
of all those who have beautified and adorned the Church of God and were
lights in the world, having embraced the word of life.  And we reject
and anathematize those whom they rejected and anathematized, as being
enemies of the truth, and as insane ragers against God, and as lifters
up of iniquity.

<span id="xiv.iii.i-p15"></span>But if any one at all shall not observe
and embrace the aforesaid pious decrees, and teach and preach in
accordance therewith, but shall attempt to set himself in opposition
thereto, let him be anathema, according to the decree already
promulgated by the approved holy and blessed Fathers, and let him be
cast out and stricken off as an alien from the number of Christians. 
For our decrees add nothing to the things previously defined, nor do
they take anything away, nor have we any such power.

<span id="xiv.iii.i-p16"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xiv.iii.i-p16.1"></span>Notes.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.i-p17"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.i-p17.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon I.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.i-p18"></span>No innovation upon the faith of the
Apostles is to be allowed.  The faith of the Nicene fathers is perfect,
which overthrows through the homousion the doctrines of Arius who
introduced degrees into the Godhead.

<span id="xiv.iii.i-p19"></span>The Synod held under Theodosius the
great shall be held inviolate, which deposed Macedonius who asserted
that the Holy Ghost was a servant.

<span id="xiv.iii.i-p20"></span>*The two hundred who under Theodosius
the Younger assembled at Ephesus are to be revered for they expelled
Nestorius who asserted that the Lord was man and God separately* (<span
class="Greek"><span id="xiv.iii.i-p20.1"></span>ἰδικῶς</span>).

<span id="xiv.iii.i-p21"></span>Those who assembled at Chalcedon in the
time of Marcion are to be celebrated with eternal remembrance, who
deposed Eutyches, who dared to say that the great mystery was
accomplished only in image, as well as Nestorius and Dioscorus,
observing equal things in an opposite direction.

<span id="xiv.iii.i-p22"></span>*One hundred and sixty-five were
assembled in the imperial city by Justinian, who anathematized Origen,
for teaching periods* (<span class="Greek"><span
id="xiv.iii.i-p22.1"></span>περιόδους</span> ) *of bodies and souls, and
Theodoret who dared to set himself up to oppose the Twelve Chapters of
Cyril.*

<span id="xiv.iii.i-p23"></span>At Constantinople a Synod was collected
under Constantine which rejected Honorius of Rome and Sergius, prelate
of Constantinople, for teaching one will and one operation.

<span id="xiv.iii.i-p24"></span><span id="page_361">p. 361</span> <span

<span id="xiv.iii.i-p25"></span>The fifth was held in the time of
Justinian the Great at Constantinople against the crazy (<span
class="Greek"><span id="xiv.iii.i-p25.1"></span>παράφρονς</span>)
Origen, Evagrius and Didymus, who remodelled the Greek figments, and
stupidly said that the same bodies they had joined with them would not
rise again; and that Paradise was not subject to the appreciation of the
sense, and that it was not from God, and that Adam was not formed in
flesh, and that there would be an end of punishment, and a restitution
of the devils to their pristine state, and other innumerable insane
blasphemies.
