id="xiv.iii.xlviii-p1.1"></span>Canon XLVII.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.xlviii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.xlviii-p2.1"></span>No</span> woman may sleep in a monastery
of men, nor any man in a monastery of women.  For it behoves the
faithful to be without offence and to give no scandal, and to order
their lives decorously and honestly and acceptably to God.  But if any
one shall have done this, whether he be cleric or layman, let him be cut
off.

<span id="xiv.iii.xlviii-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.xlviii-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XLVII.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.xlviii-p5"></span>It is not allowed that a woman
should sleep in a convent of men, nor a man in a monastery of women.

<span id="xiv.iii.xlviii-p6"></span>The ground covered by this canon is
also found in Justinian’s Code, Book xliv., *Of Bishops and Clergy*. 
*Vide* also *Novella* cxxxiii., chap. v.

id="xiv.iii.xlviii-p7.1"></span>Van Espen.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.xlviii-p8"></span>From the whole context of
Justinian’s law it is manifest that Justinian here is condemning “double
monasteries,” in which both men and women dwelt.  And he wishes such to
be separated, the men from the women, and *e contra* the women from the
men, and that each should dwell in separate monasteries.

<span id="xiv.iii.xlviii-p9"></span>The reader may be reminded of some
curious double religious houses in England for men and women, of which
sometimes a woman was the superior of both.
