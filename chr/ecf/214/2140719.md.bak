<span id="xvi.xxi-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xvi.xxi-p1.1"></span>Historical Note on the So-Called “Eighth
General Council” and Subsequent Councils.</span>

<span id="xvi.xxi-p2"></span>Whatever may be the final verdict of
history with regard to the Caroline books, to the action of this Synod
of Frankfort, and to the genuineness of the account of the Convention of
Paris, there can be no doubt with regard to the position held by the
Seventh of the Ecumenical Synods in all subsequent conciliar action.

<span id="xvi.xxi-p3"></span>In 869 <span
id="fr_554"></span>[555](#fn_554.md) was held at Constantinople what both
the Easterns and Westerns then considered to be the Eighth of the
Ecumenical Synods.  Its chief concern was to restore peace and it
thought to accomplish this by taking the strongest position against
Photius.  At this Synod the Second Council of Nice was accepted in the
most explicit manner, not only its teaching but also its rank and
number. <span id="fr_555"></span>[556](#fn_555.md)

<span id="xvi.xxi-p6"></span><span id="page_587">p. 587</span> <span
id="xvi.xxi-Page_587"></span>But not many years afterwards Photius again
got the upper hand and another synod was held, also at Constantinople,
in <span class="sc"><span id="xvi.xxi-p6.1"></span>a.d.</span> 879,
which restored Photius and which was afterwards accepted by many
Easterns as the Eighth of the Ecumenical Synods.  But at this synod, as
well as in that of 869, the position of Second Nice was fully
acknowledged.  So that after that date, roughly speaking one century
after the meeting of the Seventh Synod, despite all opposition it was
universally recognized and revered, even by those who were so rapidly
drifting further and further apart as were the East and West in the time
of Photius and his successors.

<span id="xvi.xxi-p7"></span>At the Council of Lyons in <span
class="sc"><span id="xvi.xxi-p7.1"></span>a.d.</span> 1274 there was
consent on all hands that all were united in accepting the Seven Synods
as a basis of union.

<span id="xvi.xxi-p8"></span>And finally when the acts and agreements of
the Council of Florence (1438) appeared in the first edition issued
under papal authority, that synod was styled the “Eighth,” and in this
there was no accident, for during the debate the Cardinal Julian
Cæsarini had asked the Greeks for the proceedings of the Eighth Synod
and Mark answered:  “We cannot be forced to count that synod as
ecumenical, since we do not at all recognize it but in fact reject
it.…“A few years afterwards was held a second synod which restored
Photius and annulled the acts of the preceding assembly, and this synod
also bears the title of the Eighth Ecumenical.  But Cardinal Julian did
not enter on any defence of the Ecumenical character of this so-called
“Eighth Synod.” <span id="fr_556"></span>[557](#fn_556.md)

<span id="xvi.xxi-p10"></span>For the purposes of this discussion, the
matter is perfectly clear, and even if some later writers speak still of
the “Six Ecumenical Councils” in doing so they are rejecting the Eighth
as much as the Seventh; in fact they are rejecting neither, but speaking
as did St. Gregory, who still mentioned the Four General Councils and
compared them to the Four Gospels, although the fifth had been already
held.  Those few Frankish writers who continued to speak of II. Nice as
a *pseudo council* did so out of ignorance or else in contrariety to the
teaching of the Roman Church to whose obedience they professed
subjection.  It is no place of mine to offer moral reflections upon
their doings.
