<span id="ix.viii.iv-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.viii.iv-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon III.</span>

<span id="ix.viii.iv-p5"></span>The bishop of Constantinople is to be
honoured next after the bishop of Rome.

<span id="ix.viii.iv-p6"></span>It should be remembered that the change
effected by this canon did not affect Rome directly in any way, but did
seriously affect Alexandria and Antioch, which till then had ranked next
after the see of Rome.  When the pope refused to acknowledge the
authority of this canon, he was in reality defending the principle laid
down in the canon of Nice, that in such matters the ancient customs
should continue.  Even the last clause, it would seem, could give no
offence to the most sensitive on the papal claims, for it implies a
wonderful power in the rank of Old Rome, if a see is to rank next to it
because it happens to be “New Rome.”  Of course these remarks only refer
to the wording of the canon which is carefully guarded; the intention
doubtless was to exalt the see of Constantinople, the chief see of the
East, to a position of as near equality as possible with the chief see
of the West.

<span id="ix.viii.iv-p7"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.viii.iv-p7.1"></span>Zonaras.</span>

<span id="ix.viii.iv-p8"></span>In this place the Council takes action
concerning Constantinople, to which it decrees the prerogative of
honour, the priority, and the glory after the Bishop of Rome as being
New Rome and the Queen of cities.  Some indeed wish to understand the
preposition <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.viii.iv-p8.1"></span>μετὰ</span> here of time and not of
inferiority of grade.  And they strive to confirm this interpretation by
a consideration of the XXVIII canon of Chalcedon, urging that if
Constantinople is to enjoy equal honours, the preposition “after” cannot
signify subjection.  But on the other hand the hundred and thirtieth
novel of Justinian, <span id="fr_229"></span>[230](#fn_229.md) Book V of
the Imperial Constitutions, title three, understands the canon
otherwise.  For, it says, “we decree that the most holy Pope of Old
Rome, according to the decrees of the holy synods is the first of all
priests, and that the most blessed bishop of Constantinople and of New
Rome, should have the second place after the Apostolic Throne of the
Elder Rome, and should be superior in honour to all others.”  From this
therefore it is abundantly evident that “after” denotes subjection
(<span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.viii.iv-p9.1"></span>ὑποβιβασμὸν</span>) and diminution.  And
otherwise it would be impossible to guard this equality of honour in
each see.  For in reciting their names, or assigning them seats when
they are to sit together, or arranging the order of their signatures to
documents, one must come before the other.  Whoever therefore shall
explain this particle <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.viii.iv-p9.2"></span>μετὰ</span> as only referring to time, and
does not admit that it signifies an inferior grade of dignity, does
violence to the passage and draws from it a meaning neither true nor
good.  Moreover in Canon xxxvj of the Council in Trullo, <span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.viii.iv-p9.3"></span>μετὰ</span> manifestly
denotes subjection, assigning to Constantinople the second place after
the throne of Old Rome; and then adds, after this Alexandria, then
Antioch, and last of all shall be placed Jerusalem.

<span id="ix.viii.iv-p10"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.viii.iv-p10.1"></span>Hefele.</span>

<span id="ix.viii.iv-p11"></span>If we enquire the reason why this
Council tried to change the order of rank of the great Sees, which had
been established in the sixth Nicene canon, we must first take into
consideration that, since the elevation of Constantinople to the
Imperial residence, as New Rome, the bishops as well as the Emperors
naturally wished to see the new imperial residence, New Rome, placed
immediately after Old Rome in ecclesiastical rank also; the rather, as
with the Greeks it was the rule for the ecclesiastical rank of a See to
follow the civil rank of the city.  The Synod of Antioch in 341, in its
ninth canon, had plainly declared this, and subsequently the fourth
General Council, in its seventeenth canon, spoke in the same sense.  But
how these principles were protested against on the side of Rome, we
shall see further on in the history of the fourth General Council.  For
the present, it may suffice to add that the aversion to Alexandria
which, by favouring Maximus, had exercised such a disturbing influence
on Church affairs in Constantinople, may well have helped to effect the
elevation of the See of Constantinople over that of Alexandria. 
Moreover, for many centuries Rome did not recognize this change of the
old ecclesiastical order.  In the sixteenth session of the fourth
General <span id="page_179">p. 179</span> <span
id="ix.viii.iv-Page_179"></span>Council, the Papal Legate, Lucentius,
expressly declared this.  In like manner the Popes Leo the Great and
Gregory the Great pronounced against it; and though even Gratian adopted
this canon in his collection the Roman critics added the following
note:  *Canon hic ex iis est, quos Apostolica Romana Sedes a principio
et longo post tempore non recepit*.  It was only when, after the
conquest of Constantinople by the Latins, a Latin patriarchate was
founded there in 1204, that Pope Innocent III, and the twelfth General
Council, in 1215, allowed this patriarch the first rank after the Roman;
and the same recognition was expressly awarded to the Greek Patriarch at
the Florentine Union in 1439.

<span id="ix.viii.iv-p12"></span>T. W. <span class="sc"><span
id="ix.viii.iv-p12.1"></span>Allies</span>. <span
id="fr_230"></span>[231](#fn_230.md)

<span id="ix.viii.iv-p14"></span>Remarkable enough it is that when, in
the Council of Chalcedon, appeal was made to this third Canon, the Pope
St. Leo declared that it had never been notified to Rome.  As in the
mean time it had taken effect throughout the whole East, as in this very
council Nectarius, as soon as he is elected, presides instead of Timothy
of Alexandria, it puts in a strong point of view the real
self-government of the Eastern Church at this time; for the giving the
Bishop of Constantinople precedence over Alexandria and Antioch was a
proceeding which affected the whole Church, and so far altered its
original order—one in which certainly the West might claim to have a
voice.  Tillemont goes on:  “It would be very difficult to justify St.
Leo, if he meant that the Roman Church had never known that the Bishop
of Constantinople took the second place in the Church, and the first in
the East, since his legates, whose conduct he entirely approves, had
just themselves authorized it as a thing beyond dispute, and Eusebius of
Dorylæum maintained that St. Leo himself had proved it.”  The simple
fact is, that, exceedingly unwilling as the Bishops of Rome were to
sanction it, from this time, 381, to say the least, the Bishop of
Constantinople appears uniformly as first bishop of the East.

<span id="ix.viii.iv-p15"></span>Cardinal Baronius in his *Annals*
(<span class="sc"><span id="ix.viii.iv-p15.1"></span>a.d.</span> 381, n.
35, 36) has disputed the genuineness of this Canon!  As already
mentioned it is found in the *Corpus Juris Canonici*, *Decretum*, Pars
I., Dist. XXII, c. iij.  The note added to this in Gratian reads as
follows:

<span id="ix.viii.iv-p16"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.viii.iv-p16.1"></span>Note in Gratian’s</span> “<span
class="sc"><span id="ix.viii.iv-p16.2"></span>Decretum</span>.”

<span id="ix.viii.iv-p17"></span>This canon is of the number of those
which the Apostolic See of Rome did not at first nor for long years
afterwards receive.  This is evident from Epistle LI. (or LIII.) of Pope
Leo I. to Anatolius of Constantinople and from several other of his
letters.  The same thing also is shewn by two letters of Leo IX.’s, the
one against the presumptuous acts of Michael and Leo (cap. 28) and the
other addressed to the same Michael.  But still more clearly is this
seen from the letter of Blessed Gregory (xxxj., lib. VI.) to Eulogius of
Alexandria and Anastasius of Antioch, and from the letter of Nicholas I.
to the Emperor Michel which begins “Proposueramus.”  However, the
bishops of Constantinople, sustained by the authority of the Emperors,
usurped to themselves the second place among the patriarchs, and this at
length was granted to them for the sake of peace and tranquillity, as
Pope Innocent III. declares (in *cap. antiqua de privileg*.). <span
id="fr_231"></span>[232](#fn_231.md)

<span id="ix.viii.iv-p19"></span>This canon Dionysius Exiguus appends to
Canon 2, and dropping 5, 6, and 7 he has but three canons of this Synod.

<span id="ix.viii.iv-p9"></span> The reader will notice that this is not
even an approximately contemporaneous interpretation, but more than a
century and a half later, after Leo I. had done so much to establish the
power of his see.

<span id="ix.viii.iv-p18"></span> For some reason this canon does not
seem to be any more acceptable to modern champions of the Papacy than it
was to the Church of Rome fifteen hundred years ago.  I give as a sample
of this the following from a recent Roman Catholic writer:  “The decree
which goes by the name of the Third Canon of Constantinople was the germ
of the successful mendacity of the arch-rebel Photius.”  (Rivington. 
*The Prim. Ch*., p. 263).  The phraseology seems to suggest warm
discontent at the canon.
