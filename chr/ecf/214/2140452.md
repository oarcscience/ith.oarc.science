id="xiv.iii.lxix-p1.1"></span>Canon LXVIII.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.lxix-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.lxix-p2.1"></span>It</span> is unlawful for anyone to
corrupt or cut up a book of the Old or New Testament or of our holy and
approved preachers and teachers, or to give them up to the traders in
books or to those who are called perfumers, or to hand it over for
destruction to any other like persons:  unless to be sure it has been
rendered useless either by bookworms, or by water, or in some other
way.  He who henceforth shall be observed to do such a thing shall be
cut off for one year.  Likewise also he who buys such books (unless he
keeps them for his own use, or gives them to another for his benefit to
be preserved) and has attempted to corrupt them, let him be cut off.

id="xiv.iii.lxix-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon LXVIII.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.lxix-p5"></span>Thou shalt not destroy nor hand over
copies of the Divine Scriptures to be destroyed unless they are
absolutely useless.

<span id="xiv.iii.lxix-p7"></span>(Foot-note.)

<span id="xiv.iii.lxix-p8"></span>I think that this canon was directed
against certain Nestorian and Eutychian heretics, who, that they might
find some patronage of their errors from the Holy Scriptures, dared in
the sixth century most infamously to corrupt certain passages of the New
Testament.
