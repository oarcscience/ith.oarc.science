id="viii.v.iv.iv-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon IV.</span>

<span id="viii.v.iv.iv-p5"></span>Anathema to him who hesitates to
receive communion from presbyters joined in matrimony.

<span id="viii.v.iv.iv-p7"></span>As is well known, the ancient Church,
as now the Greek Church, allowed those clergy who married before their
ordination to continue to live in matrimony.  Compare what was said
above in the history of the Council of Nicæa, in connection with
Paphnutius, concerning the celibacy and marriage of priests in the
ancient Church.  Accordingly this canon speaks of those clergy who have
wives and live in wedlock; and Baronius, Binius, and Mitter-Müller gave
themselves useless trouble <span id="page_94">p. 94</span> <span
id="viii.v.iv.iv-Page_94"></span>in trying to interpret it as only
protecting those clergy who, though married, have since their ordination
ceased to cohabit with their wives.

<span id="viii.v.iv.iv-p8"></span>The so-called *Codex Ecclesiæ Romanæ*
published by Quesnel, which, however, as was shown by the
Ballerini, <span id="fr_156"></span>[157](#fn_156) is of Gallican and
not Roman origin, has not this canon, and consequently it only mentions
nineteen canons of Gangra.
