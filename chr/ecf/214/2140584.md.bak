id="xv.iv.iv.lxi-p1.1"></span>Canon LX.  (Greek lxiii.)</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxi-p2"></span>Of heathen feasts.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxi-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.lxi-p3.1"></span>This</span> also must be sought, that
(since contrary to the divine precepts feasts are held in many places,
which have been induced by the heathen error, so that now Christians are
forced to celebrate these by heathens, from which state of things it
happens that in the times of the Christian Emperors a new persecution
seems to have secretly arisen:)  they order such things to be forbidden
and prohibit them from cities and possessions under pain of punishment;
especially should this be done since they do not fear to commit such
iniquities in some cities even upon the natal days of most blessed
martyrs, and in the very sacred places themselves.  For upon these days,
shame to say, they perform the most wicked leapings throughout the
fields and open places, so that matronal honour and the modesty of
innumerable women who have come out of devotion for the most holy day
are assaulted by lascivious injuries, so that all approach to holy
religion itself is almost fled from.

id="xv.iv.iv.lxi-p5.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon LX.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxi-p6"></span>The Greek feasts must cease to be
kept, because of their impropriety, and because they seduce many
Christians, moreover they are celebrated on the commemorations of the
martyrs.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxi-p7"></span>This is Canon iv. of the Synod of
Carthage, Aug. 15 (or 16), <span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.lxi-p7.1"></span>a.d.</span> 401.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxi-p9"></span>Bishop Beveridge and Tilius’s edition
of these canons, in Greek and Latin, number the two preceding canons as
I have done in the margin, with the same figures \[viz.:  63\].  I
follow them in this error because by this means the reader may more
readily be referred from the Latin original and from this English
translation to the Greek.
