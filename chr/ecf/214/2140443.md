<span id="xiv.iii.lx-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.lx-p2.1"></span>Baptism</span> is by no means to be
administered in an oratory which is within a house; but they who are
about to be held worthy of the spotless illumination are to go to a
Catholic Church and there to enjoy this gift.  But if any one shall be
convicted of not observing what we have determined, if he be a cleric
let him be deposed, if a layman let him be cut off.

<span id="xiv.iii.lx-p4"></span>*In oratories built in houses they shall
not celebrate baptism.  Whoever shall not observe this, if a cleric he
shall be deposed, if a layman he shall be cut off.*
