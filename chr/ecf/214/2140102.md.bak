<span id="viii.iv.iii.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="viii.iv.iii.xi-p1.1"></span>Canon XI.</span>

<span id="viii.iv.iii.xi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iv.iii.xi-p2.1"></span>Let</span> not a presbyter be ordained
before he is thirty years of age, even though he be in all respects a
worthy man, but let him be made to wait.  For our Lord Jesus Christ was
baptized and began to teach in his thirtieth year.

<span id="viii.iv.iii.xi-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iv.iii.xi-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XI.</span>

<span id="viii.iv.iii.xi-p5"></span>Unless he be xxx. years of age none
shall be presbyter, even should he be worthy, following the example of
the baptism of our Saviour.

<span id="viii.iv.iii.xi-p6"></span>This canon is found in the *Corpus
Juris Canonici*, Gratian’s *Decretum*, Pars I., Dist. lxxviii., c. iv.

<span id="viii.iv.iii.xi-p7"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iv.iii.xi-p7.1"></span>Gratian.</span>

<span id="viii.iv.iii.xi-p8"></span>(*Ut supra*, Nota.)

<span id="viii.iv.iii.xi-p9"></span>This is the law, and we do not read
that Christ, or John the Baptist, or Ezechiel, or some other of the
Prophets prophesied or preached before that age.  But Jeremiah and
Daniel we read received the spirit of prophecy before they had arrived
even at youth, and David and Solomon are found to have been anointed in
their youth, also John the Evangelist, while still a youth, was chosen
by the Lord for an Apostle, and we find that with the rest he was sent
forth to preach:  Paul also, as we know, while still a young man was
called by the Lord, and was sent out to preach.  The Church in like
manner, when necessity compels, is wont to ordain some under thirty
years of age.

<span id="viii.iv.iii.xi-p10"></span>For this reason Pope Zacharias in
his Letter to Boniface the Bishop, number vi., which begins “Benedictus
Deus” says,

<span id="viii.iv.iii.xi-p11"></span>C. v.  *In case of necessity
presbyters may be ordained at xxv. years of age*.

<span id="viii.iv.iii.xi-p12"></span>If men thirty years old cannot be
found, and necessity so demand, Levites and priests may be ordained from
twenty-five years of age upwards.

<span id="viii.iv.iii.xi-p13"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iv.iii.xi-p13.1"></span>Van Espen.</span>

<span id="viii.iv.iii.xi-p14"></span>The power of dispensing was
committed to the bishop, and at length it was so frequently exercised
that in the space of one century \[i.e. by the end of the xiith
century\] the law became abrogated, which was brought about by
necessity, so that it passed into law that a presbyter could be ordained
at twenty-five.  And from this it may appear how true it is that there
is no surer way of destroying discipline and abrogating law than the
allowing of dispensations and relaxations.  Vide Thomassinus, *De Disc.
Eccles*., Pars. IV., Lib. I., cap. 46.
