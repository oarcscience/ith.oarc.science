<span id="viii.v.ii-p1"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="viii.v.ii-p1.1"></span>Historical Introduction.</span>

<span id="viii.v.ii-p2"></span>With regard to the Synod of Gangra we
know little beside what we learn from its own synodal letter.  Three
great questions naturally arise with regard to it.

<span id="viii.v.ii-p3"></span>1.  What was its date?

<span id="viii.v.ii-p4"></span>2.  Who was the Eustathius it condemned?

<span id="viii.v.ii-p5"></span>3.  Who was its presiding officer?

<span id="viii.v.ii-p6"></span>I shall briefly give the reader the
salient points with regard to each of these matters.

<span id="viii.v.ii-p7"></span>1.  With regard to the date, there can be
no doubt that it was after Nice and before the First Council of
Constantinople, that is between 325 and 381.  Socrates <span
id="fr_130"></span>[131](#fn_130.md) seems to place it about 365; but
Sozomen <span id="fr_131"></span>[132](#fn_131.md) some twenty years
earlier.  On the other hand, Remi Ceillier <span
id="fr_132"></span>[133](#fn_132.md) inconsistently with his other
statements, seems to argue from St. Basil’s letters that the true date
is later than 376.  Still another theory has been urged by the
Ballerini, resting on the supposition that the Eusebius who presided was
Eusebius of Cæsarea, and they therefore fix the date between 362 and
370.  With this Mr. Ffoulkes agrees, and fixes the date, <span
id="fr_133"></span>[134](#fn_133.md) with Pagi, at 358, and is bold enough
to add, “and this was unquestionably the year of the Council.”  But in
the old collections of canons almost without exception, the canons of
Gangra precede those of Antioch, and Blondel and Tillemont <span
id="fr_134"></span>[135](#fn_134.md) have sustained this, which perhaps I
may call the traditional date.

<span id="viii.v.ii-p13"></span>2.  There does not seem to be any
reasonable ground to doubt that the person condemned, Eustathius by
name, was the famous bishop of Sebaste.  This may be gathered from both
Sozomen <span id="fr_135"></span>[136](#fn_135.md) and Socrates, <span
id="fr_136"></span>[137](#fn_136.md) and is confirmed incidentally by one
of St. Basil’s epistles. <span id="fr_137"></span>[138](#fn_137.md)  
Moreover, Eustathius’s See of Sebaste is in Armenia, and it is to the
bishops of Armenia that the Synod addresses its letter.  It would seem
in view of all this that Bp. Hefele’s words are not too severe when he
writes, “Under such circumstances the statement of Baronius, Du Pin, and
others (supported by no single ancient testimony) that another
Eustathius, or possibly the monk Eutactus, is here meant, deserves no
serious consideration, though Tillemont did not express himself as
opposed to it.” <span id="fr_138"></span>[139](#fn_138.md)

<span id="viii.v.ii-p18"></span>The story that after his condemnation by
the Synod of Gangra Eustathius gave up wearing his peculiar garb and
other eccentricities, Sozomen only gives as a report. <span
id="fr_139"></span>[140](#fn_139.md)

<span id="viii.v.ii-p20"></span>3.  As to who was the president, it
seems tolerably certain that his name was Eusebius—if Sozomen <span
id="fr_140"></span>[141](#fn_140.md) indeed means it was “Eusebius of
Constantinople,” it is a blunder, yet he had the name right.  In the
heading of the Synodal letter Eusebius is first named, and as Gangra and
Armenia were within the jurisdiction of Cæsarea, it certainly would seem
natural to suppose that the Eusebius named was the Metropolitan of that
province, but it must be remembered that Eusebius of Cappadocia was not
made bishop until 362, four years after Mr. Ffoulkes makes him preside
at Gangra.  The names of thirteen bishops are given in the Greek text.

<span id="viii.v.ii-p22"></span>The Latin translations add other names,
such as that of Hosius of Cordova, and some Latin writers have asserted
that he presided as legate *à latere* from the pope, *e.g.*,
Baronius <span id="fr_141"></span>[142](#fn_141.md) and Binius. <span
id="fr_142"></span>[143](#fn_142.md)   Hefele denies this and says:  “At
the time of the Synod of Gangra Hosius was <span id="page_90">p.
90</span> <span id="viii.v.ii-Page_90"></span>without doubt dead.” <span
id="fr_143"></span>[144](#fn_143.md)   But such has not been the opinion of
the learned, and Cave <span id="fr_144"></span>[145](#fn_144.md) is of
opinion that Hosius’s episcopate covered seventy years ending with 361,
and (resting on the same opinion) Pagi thinks Hosius may have attended
the Synod in 358 on his way back to Spain, an opinion with which, as I
have said, Mr. Ffoulkes agrees.  It seems also clear that by the
beginning of the sixth century the Synod of Gangra was looked upon at
Rome as having been held under papal authority; Pope Symmachus expressly
saying so to the Roman Synod of 504.  (*Vide* Notes on Canons vij. and
viij.)

<span id="viii.v.ii-p27"></span>It remains only further to remark that
the *Libellus Synodicus* mentions a certain Dius as president of the
Synod.  The Ballarini <span id="fr_145"></span>[146](#fn_145.md) suggest
that it should be <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.v.ii-p28.1"></span>Βίος</span>, an abbreviation of Eusebius. 
Mr. Ffoulkes suggests that Dius is “probably Dianius, the predecessor of
Eusebius.”  Lightfoot <span id="fr_146"></span>[147](#fn_146.md) fixes the
episcopate of Eusebius Pamphili as between 313 and 337; and states that
that of Eusebius of Cæsarea in Cappadocia did not begin until 362, so
that the enormous chronological difficulties will be evident to the
reader.

<span id="viii.v.ii-p30"></span>As all the proposed new dates involve
more or less contradiction, I have given the canons their usual position
between Neocæsarea and Antioch, and have left the date undetermined.
