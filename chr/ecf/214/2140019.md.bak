id="vii.vi.i-p1.1"></span>The Canons of the 318 Holy Fathers Assembled
in the City of Nice, in Bithynia.</span>

<span id="vii.vi.i-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="vii.vi.i-p2.1"></span>Canon I.</span>

<span id="vii.vi.i-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="vii.vi.i-p3.1"></span>If</span> any one in sickness has been
subjected by physicians to a surgical operation, or if he has been
castrated by barbarians, let him remain among the clergy; but, if any
one in sound health has castrated himself, it behoves that such an one,
if \[already\] enrolled among the clergy, should cease \[from his
ministry\], and that from henceforth no such person should be promoted. 
But, as it is evident that this is said of those who wilfully do the
thing and presume to castrate themselves, so if any have been made
eunuchs by barbarians, or by their masters, and should otherwise be
found worthy, such men the Canon admits to the clergy.

id="vii.vi.i-p5.1"></span>Ancient Epitome <span
id="fr_56"></span>[57](#fn_56.md) of Canon I.</span>

<span id="vii.vi.i-p7"></span>Eunuchs may be received into the number of
the clergy, but those who castrate themselves shall not be received.

<span id="vii.vi.i-p9"></span>The divine Apostolic Canons xxi., xxii.,
xxiii., and xxiv., have taught us sufficiently what ought to be done
with those who castrate themselves, this canon provides as to what is to
be done to these as well as to those who deliver themselves over to
others to be emasculated by them, viz., that they are not to be admitted
among the clergy nor advanced to the priesthood.

<span id="vii.vi.i-p11"></span>(Smith & Cheetham, *Dict. Christ. Ant.*)

<span id="vii.vi.i-p12"></span>The feeling that one devoted to the
sacred ministry should be unmutilated was strong in the Ancient
Church.…This canon of Nice, and those in the Apostolic Canons and a
later one in the Second Council of Arles (canon vii.) were aimed against
that perverted notion of piety, originating in the misinterpretation of
our Lord’s saying ([Matt. xix. 12](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#012.md)<span
id="vii.vi.i-p12.1"></span>) by which Origen, among others, was misled,
and their observance was so carefully enforced in later times that not
more than one or two instances of the practice which they condemn are
noticed by the historian.  The case was different if a man was born an
eunuch or had suffered mutilation at the hands of persecutors; an
instance of the former, Dorotheus, presbyter of Antioch, is mentioned by
Eusebius (*H. E.* vii., c. 32); of the latter, Tigris, presbyter of
Constantinople, is referred to both by Socrates (*H. E.* vi. 15) and
Sozomen (*H. E.* vi. 24) as the victim of a barbarian master.

<span id="vii.vi.i-p13"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="vii.vi.i-p13.1"></span>Hefele.</span>

<span id="vii.vi.i-p14"></span>We know, by the first apology of St.
Justin (*Apol.* c. 29) that a century before Origen, a young man had
desired to be mutilated by physicians, for the purpose of completely
refuting the charge of vice which the heathen brought against the
worship of Christians.  St. Justin neither praises nor blames this young
man:  he only relates that he could not obtain the permission of the
civil authorities for his project, that he renounced his intention, but
nevertheless remained *virgo* all his life.  It is very probable that
the Council of Nice was induced by some fresh similar cases to renew the
old injunctions; it was perhaps the Arian bishop, Leontius, who was the
principal cause of it. <span id="fr_57"></span>[58](#fn_57.md)

<span id="vii.vi.i-p16"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="vii.vi.i-p16.1"></span>Lambert.</span>

<span id="vii.vi.i-p17"></span>Constantine forbade by a law the practice
condemned in this canon.  “If anyone shall anywhere in the Roman Empire
after this decree make eunuchs, he shall be punished with death.  If the
owner of the place where the deed was perpetrated was aware of it and
hid the fact, his goods shall be confiscated.”  (Const. M. *Opera.*
Migne Patrol. vol. viii., 396.)

<span id="vii.vi.i-p18"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="vii.vi.i-p18.1"></span>Beveridge.</span>

<span id="vii.vi.i-p19"></span>The Nicene fathers in this canon make no
new enactment but only confirm by the authority of an Ecumenical synod
the Apostolic Canons, and this is evident from the wording of this
canon.  For there can be no doubt that they had in mind some earlier
canon when they said, “such men the canon admits to the clergy.”  Not,
<span class="Greek"><span id="vii.vi.i-p19.1"></span>ὁυτος ὁ
κανὼν</span>, but <span class="Greek"><span id="vii.vi.i-p19.2"></span>ὁ
κανὼν</span>, as if they had said “the formerly set forth <span
id="page_9">p. 9</span> <span id="vii.vi.i-Page_9"></span>and well-known
canon” admits such to the clergy.  But no other canon then existed in
which this provision occurred except apostolical canon xxi. which
therefore we are of opinion is here cited.

<span id="vii.vi.i-p20"></span>\[In this conclusion Hefele also
agrees.\]

<span id="vii.vi.i-p21"></span>This law was frequently enacted by
subsequent synods and is inserted in the *Corpus Juris Canonici,
Decretum Gratiani.* Pars. I.  Distinctio LV., C vij.

<span id="vii.vi.i-p15"></span> Leontius while still a presbyter lived
with a *subintroducta* at Antioch, whose name was Eustolion, so we learn
from St. Athanasius, Theodoret (*H. E.* ii. 24) and Socrates (*H. E*.
ii. 26); as he could not part from her and wished to prevent her leaving
him, he mutilated himself.  His bishop deposed him for this act, but the
Emperor Constantius (not Constantine, as by a mistake in the English
Hefele, I. p. 377) practically forced him into the episcopal throne of
Antioch.
