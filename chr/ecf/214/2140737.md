<span id="xvii.xvii-p4"></span>A letter to his Village-bishop: <span
id="fr_597"></span>[598](#fn_597)   he complains of the want of
discipline of the multiplying of the clergy, and that without due
examination and enquiry into their morals; that they had dropped the old
custom, which was for the priests and deacons to recommend to the
Village Bishop, who taking the testimonial, and giving notice of it to
the \[City\] Bishop, did afterwards admit the minister into the
sacerdotal list; that the number of the inferior clergy was unreasonably
increased, especially in time of war, when men got into orders to avoid
the press:  he orders a list of the clergy in every village to be sent
to him, and who admitted him, if any have been admitted into the
inferior orders by priests, that they be looked on as laymen.  Let not
who will, put his name into the list.  Re-examine those who are there,
expel the unworthy, admit none without my consent for the future; if you
do he shall be counted a layman.
