<p class="c35"><a name="xi.xviii.xxv-p5"></A>Let the ordination of bishops be within three months:&#160; necessity however may make the time longer.&#160; But if anyone shall ordain counter to this decree, he shall be liable to punishment.&#160; The revenue shall remain with the &#339;conomus.</p>

<p class="c18"><a name="xi.xviii.xxv-p7"></A>The &#8220;Steward of the Church&#8221; was to &#8220;take care of the revenues of the church widowed&#8221; by the death of its bishop, who was regarded as representing Him to whom the whole Church was espoused (see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#023">Eph. v. 23</a><a name="xi.xviii.xxv-p7.1"></A> ff.).&#160; So in the &#8220;order of the holy and great church&#8221; of St. Sophia, the &#8220;Great Steward&#8221; is described as &#8220;taking the oversight of the widowed church&#8221; (Goar, <i>Eucholog</i>., p. 269); so Hincmar says:&#160; &#8220;Si fuerit defunctus episcopus, ego&#8230;visitatorem ipsi viduat&aelig; designabo ecclesi&aelig;; &#8220;and the phrase, &#8220;viduata per mortem N. nuper episcopi&#8221; became common in the West (F. G. Lee, <i>Validity of English Orders</i>, p. 373).&#160; The episcopal ring was a symbol of the same idea.&#160; So at St. Chrysostom&#146;s restoration Eudoxia claimed to have &#8220;given back the bridegroom&#8221; (<i>Serm. post redit</i>., iv.).&#160; So Bishop Wilson told Queen Caroline that he &#8220;would not leave his wife in his old age because she was poor&#8221; (Keble&#146;s <i>Life of Wilson</i>, ii., 767); and Peter Mongus, having invaded the Alexandrian see while its legitimate occupant, Timothy Salophaciolus, was alive, was expelled as an &#8220;adulterer&#8221; (Liberatus, <i>Breviar</i>., xviij.).</p>
