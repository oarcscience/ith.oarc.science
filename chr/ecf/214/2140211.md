<span id="viii.vii.iii.xlv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.vii.iii.xlv-p2.1"></span>Bishops</span> called to a synod must
not be guilty of contempt, but must attend, and either teach, or be
taught, for the reformation of the Church and of others.  And if such an
one shall be guilty of contempt, he will condemn himself, unless he be
detained by ill health.

id="viii.vii.iii.xlv-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XL.</span>

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xlv-p5"></span>Whoso summoned to a synod shall
spurn the invitation, unless hindered by the force of circumstances,
shall not be free from blame.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xlv-p7"></span>By <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.vii.iii.xlv-p7.1"></span>ἀνωμαλία</span>, illness is commonly
understood, and Dionysius Exiguus and Isidore translated it, the former
*ægritudinem*, and the latter *infirmitatem*.  But Balsamon justly
remarks that the term has a wider meaning, and, besides cases of illness
includes other unavoidable hinderances or obstacles.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xlv-p8"></span>This Canon is found in the *Corpus
Juris Canonici*, Gratian’s *Decretum*, Pars I., Dist. XVIII., c. v.
