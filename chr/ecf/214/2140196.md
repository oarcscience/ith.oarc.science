<span id="viii.vii.iii.xxx-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="viii.vii.iii.xxx-p1.1"></span>Canon XXV.</span>

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xxx-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.vii.iii.xxx-p2.1"></span>A subdeacon</span> must not give the
Bread, nor bless the Cup.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xxx-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.vii.iii.xxx-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XXV.</span>

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xxx-p5"></span>A subdeacon may not give the bread
and the cup.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xxx-p6"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.vii.iii.xxx-p6.1"></span>Aristenus.</span>

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xxx-p7"></span>Subdeacons are not allowed to
perform the work of presbyters and deacons.  Wherefore they neither
deliver the bread nor the cup to the people.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xxx-p8"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.vii.iii.xxx-p8.1"></span>Hefele.</span>

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xxx-p9"></span>According to the Apostolic
Constitutions, the communion was administered in the following manner: 
the bishop gave to each the holy bread with the words:  “the Body of the
Lord,” and the recipient said, “Amen.”  The deacon then gave the chalice
with the words:  “the Blood of Christ, the chalice of life,” and the
recipient again answered, “Amen.”  This giving of the chalice with the
words:  “the Blood of Christ,” etc., is called in the canon of Laodicea
a “blessing” (<span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.vii.iii.xxx-p9.1"></span>εὐλογεῖν</span>).  The Greek
commentator Aristenus in accordance with this, and quite rightly, gives
the meaning of this canon.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xxx-p10"></span>This canon is found in the
*Corpus Juris Canonici*, Gratian’s *Decretum*, Pars I., Diet. XCIII., c.
xix.; but reads “Deacons” instead of “Subdeacons.”  The Roman Correctors
point out the error.
