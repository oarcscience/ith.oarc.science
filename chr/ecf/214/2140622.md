id="xv.iv.iv.xcix-p1.1"></span>Canon XCVIII.  (Greek cii.)</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xcix-p2"></span>Of the peoples which never had
bishops.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xcix-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xcix-p3.1"></span>It</span> seemed good that such peoples
as had never had bishops of their own should in no way receive such
unless it had been decreed in a plenary council of each province and by
the primates, and with the consent of the bishop of that diocese to
which the church belonged.

id="xv.iv.iv.xcix-p5.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XCVIII.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xcix-p6"></span>Whoso never heretofore had a bishop
of their own, unless the general synod of the Province shall agree to
it, and the Primate, in agreement with him to whom the province in which
the Church is, is subject, shall not have bishops of their own.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xcix-p7"></span>This canon is Canon iv. of the Synod
of Carthage, <span class="sc"><span
