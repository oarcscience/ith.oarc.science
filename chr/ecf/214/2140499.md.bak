<span id="xv.iii.iv.v-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xv.iii.iv.v-p1.1"></span>Canon V.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.iv.v-p2"></span>(*Greek*.)

<span id="xv.iii.iv.v-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iii.iv.v-p3.1"></span>Bishop</span> <span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iii.iv.v-p3.2"></span>Hosius</span> said:  Decreed, that if any
bishop is accused, and the bishops of the same region assemble and
depose him from his office, and he appealing, so to speak, takes refuge
with the most blessed bishop of the Roman church, and he be willing to
give him a hearing, and think it right to renew the examination of his
case, let him be pleased to write to those fellow-bishops who are
nearest the province that they may examine the particulars with care and
accuracy and give their votes on the matter in accordance with the word
of truth.  And if any one require that his case be heard yet again, and
at his request it seem good to move the bishop of Rome to send
presbyters *a latere*, let it be in the power of that bishop, according
as he judges it to be good and decides it to be right—that some be sent
to be judges with the bishops and invested with his authority by whom
they were sent.  And be this also ordained.  But if he think that the
bishops are sufficient for the examination and decision of the matter
let him do what shall seem good in his most prudent judgment.

<span id="xv.iii.iv.v-p4"></span>The bishops answered:  What has been
said is approved.

<span id="xv.iii.iv.v-p5"></span>(*Latin*.)

<span id="xv.iii.iv.v-p6"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iii.iv.v-p6.1"></span>Bishop</span> <span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iii.iv.v-p6.2"></span>Hosius</span> said:  Further decreed, that
if a bishop is accused, and the bishops of that region assemble and
depose him from his office, if he who has been deposed shall appeal and
take refuge with the bishop of the Roman church and wishes to be given a
hearing, if he think it right that the trial or examination of his case
be renewed, let him be pleased to write to those bishops who are in an
adjacent and neighbouring province, that they may diligently inquire
into all the particulars and decide according to the word of truth.  But
if he who asks to have his case reheard, shall by his entreaty move the
Bishop of Rome to send a presbyter *a latere* it shall be in the power
of that bishop to do what he shall resolve and determine upon; and if he
shall decide that some be sent, who shall be present and be judges with
the bishops invested with his authority by whom they were appointed, it
shall be as he shall choose.  But if he believe that the bishops suffice
to give a final decision, he shall do what he shall determine upon in
his most wise judgment.

id="xv.iii.iv.v-p8.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon V.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.iv.v-p9"></span>\[Lacking.\]

<span id="xv.iii.iv.v-p10"></span>This Canon is vij. of Isidore’s
collection.

<span id="xv.iii.iv.v-p11"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iii.iv.v-p11.1"></span>Van Espen.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.iv.v-p12"></span>Mere there is properly speaking no
provision for “appeal,” which entirely suspends \[i.e. by the canon
law\] the execution and effect of the first sentence; but rather for a
revision of judgment.…; those who were sent by the Roman bishop from his
side (*a latere*) or the bishops who were appointed, ought, together
with the bishops of the province who had given the former sentence, to
give a fresh judgment and declare their sentence.  And this Hincmar of
Rheims was the first to notice in his letters in the name of Charles the
Bald sent to John VIII.

<span id="xv.iii.iv.v-p13"></span>This view is supported with his
accustomed learning and acumen by Du Pin, *De Antiqua Eccl.*
*Disciplina*, Diss. II., Cap. I., Sec. 3.
