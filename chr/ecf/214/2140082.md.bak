<span id="viii.iii.iii.xxi-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.xxi-p1.1"></span>Canon XX.</span>

<span id="viii.iii.iii.xxi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.xxi-p2.1"></span>If</span> the wife of anyone has
committed adultery or if any man commit adultery it seems fit that he
shall be restored to full communion after seven years passed in the
prescribed degrees \[of penance\].

<span id="viii.iii.iii.xxi-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.xxi-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XX.</span>

<span id="viii.iii.iii.xxi-p5"></span>An adulteress and an adulterer are
to be cut off for seven years.

<span id="viii.iii.iii.xxi-p6"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.xxi-p6.1"></span>Hefele.</span>

<span id="viii.iii.iii.xxi-p7"></span>The simplest explanation of this
canon is “that the man or woman who has violated the marriage bond shall
undergo a seven years’ penance”; but many reject this explanation,
because the text says <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.xxi-p7.1"></span>αὐτὸν τύχειν</span> and consequently
can refer only to the husband.  Fleury and Routh think the canon speaks,
as does the seventieth of Elvira, of a woman who has broken the marriage
tie with the knowledge and consent of her husband.  The husband would
therefore in this case be punished for this permission, just as if he
had himself committed adultery.  Van Espen has given another
explanation:  “That he who marries a woman already divorced for adultery
is as criminal as if he had himself committed adultery.”  But this
explanation appears to us more forced than that already given; and we
think that the Greek commentators Balsamon and Zonaras were right in
giving the explanation we have offered first as the most natural.  They
think that the Synod punished every adulterer, whether man or woman, by
a seven years’ penance.  There is no reason for making a mistake because
only the word <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.xxi-p7.2"></span>αὐτὸν</span> occurs in the passage in
which the penalty is fixed; for <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.xxi-p7.3"></span>αὐτὸν</span> here means the guilty
party, and applies equally to the woman and the man:  besides, in the
preceding canon the masculine <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.xxi-p7.4"></span>ὅσοι ἐπαγγελλόμενοι</span> includes
young men and young women also.  It is probable that the Trullan Synod
of 692, in forming its eighty-seventh canon, had in view the twentieth
of Ancyra.  The sixty-ninth canon of Elvira condemned to a lighter
punishment—only five years of penance—him who had been only once guilty
of adultery.
