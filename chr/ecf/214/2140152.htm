<p class="c18"><a name="viii.vi.iv.xv-p7"></A>By the phrase &#8220;by others&#8221; must be understood bishops called from a neighbouring province, of which mention is made in the previous canon, where in the case of an agreement among the bishops, the synod did not wish to be called in, even if it were demanded by the condemned bishop.&#160; This canon, therefore, is a supplement as it were to the preceding.&#160; And for this reason in the <i>Breviarium</i> and in Cresconius&#146;s <i>Collection</i> of Canons they are placed under a common title, cap. 144, &#8220;Concerning the difference of opinion which happens in the judgment of bishops, or when a bishop is cut off by all the bishops of his province.&#8221;</p> 
<p class="c19"><a name="viii.vi.iv.xv-p8"></A>From these canons it is manifest that at first the causes of bishops were agitated and decided in provincial synods, and this discipline continued for many centuries, and was little by little departed from in the <span class="sc"><a name="viii.vi.iv.xv-p8.1"></A>VIII</span>th and <span class="sc"><a name="viii.vi.iv.xv-p8.2"></A>IX</span>th centuries.</p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="viii.vi.iv.xv-p9"></A>This canon is found in the <i>Corpus Juris Canonici</i>, Gratian&#146;s <i>Decretum</i>, Pars II., Causa VI., Qu&aelig;st. IV., Can. v.&#160; Gratian adds a note which Van Espen remarks smacks of his own date rather than of that of the Synod of Antioch.</p>
