<span id="xi.xiv-p3"></span>(Labbe and Cossart, *Concilia*, Tom. IV.,
col. 611.)

<span id="xi.xiv-p4"></span>\[*The Emperor was present in person and
addressed the Council and afterwards suggested legislation under three
heads, the drafts for which were read*.\]

<span id="xi.xiv-p5"></span>After this reading, the capitulas were
handed by our most sacred and pious prince to the most beloved of God
Anatolius, archbishop of royal Constantinople, which is New Rome, and
all the most God-beloved bishops cried out:  Many years to our Emperor
and Empress, the pious, the Christian.  May Christ whom thou servest
keep thee.  These things are worthy of the faith.  To the Priest, the
Emperor.  Thou hast straightened out the churches, victor of thine
enemies, teacher of the faith.  Many years to the pious Empress, the
lover of Christ.  Many years to her that is orthodox.  May God save your
kingdom.  Ye have put down the heretics, ye have kept the faith.  May
hatred be far removed from your empire, and may your kingdom endure for
ever!

<span id="xi.xiv-p6"></span>Our most sacred and pious prince said to the
holy synod:  To the honour of the holy martyr Euphemia, and of your
holiness, we decree that the city of Chalcedon, in which the synod of
the holy faith has been held, shall have the honours of a metropolis, in
name only giving it this honour, the proper dignity of the city of
Nicomedia being preserved.

<span id="xi.xiv-p7"></span>All cried out, etc., etc.
