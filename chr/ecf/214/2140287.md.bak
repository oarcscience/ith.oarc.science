<span id="x.xvi.v-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="x.xvi.v-p1.1"></span>Canon III.</span>

<span id="x.xvi.v-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="x.xvi.v-p2.1"></span>If</span> any of the city or country clergy
have been inhibited by Nestorius or his followers from the exercise of
the priesthood, on account of their orthodoxy, we have declared it just
that these should be restored to their proper rank.  And in general we
forbid all the clergy who adhere to the Orthodox and Ecumenical Synod in
any way to submit to the bishops who have already apostatized or shall
hereafter apostatize.

<span id="x.xvi.v-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="x.xvi.v-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon III.</span>

<span id="x.xvi.v-p5"></span>To whom Nestorius forbids the priesthood,
he is most worthy; but whom he approves is profane.

<span id="x.xvi.v-p6"></span>It would seem from this canon that any
bishop who had become a member of the Conciliabulum of John, was
considered as *eo ipso* having lost all jurisdiction.  Also it would
seem that the clergy were to disregard the inhibition of Nestorian
prelates or at least these inhibitions were by some one to be removed. 
This principle, if generally applied, would seem to be somewhat
revolutionary.

<span id="x.xvi.v-p8"></span>(*Apos. Fath*. Ign. *Ad Rom*. i., Vol. II.,
Sec. I., p. 191.)

<span id="x.xvi.v-p9"></span>The words <span class="Greek"><span
id="x.xvi.v-p9.1"></span>χῶρος</span> (“place”), <span
class="Greek"><span id="x.xvi.v-p9.2"></span>χώρα</span> (“country”),
and <span class="Greek"><span id="x.xvi.v-p9.3"></span>χωρίον</span>
(“district”), may be distinguished as implying *locality*, *extension*,
and *limitation*, respectively.  The last word commonly denotes either
“an estate, a farm,” or “a fastness, a stronghold,” or (as a
mathematical term) “an area.”  Here, as not unfrequently in later
writers, it is “a region, a district,” but the same fundamental idea is
presumed.  The relation of <span class="Greek"><span
id="x.xvi.v-p9.4"></span>χῶρος</span> to <span class="Greek"><span
id="x.xvi.v-p9.5"></span>χωρίον</span> is the same as that of <span
class="Greek"><span id="x.xvi.v-p9.6"></span>ἄργυρος</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="x.xvi.v-p9.7"></span>,</span> <span
class="Greek"><span id="x.xvi.v-p9.8"></span>χρυσός</span> to <span
class="Greek"><span id="x.xvi.v-p9.9"></span>ἀργύριον</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="x.xvi.v-p9.10"></span>,</span> <span
class="Greek"><span id="x.xvi.v-p9.11"></span>χρυσίον</span>, the <span
id="page_229">p. 229</span> <span id="x.xvi.v-Page_229"></span>former
being the metals themselves, the latter the metals worked up into
bullion or coins or plate or trinkets or images, *e.g.* Macar. Magn.
*Apocr*. iii. 42 (p. 147).
