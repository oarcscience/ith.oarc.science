id="vii.vi.ii-p1.1"></span>Excursus on the Use of the Word
“Canon.”</span>

<span id="vii.vi.ii-p2"></span>(Bright:  *Notes on the Canons*, pp. 2
and 3.)

<span id="vii.vi.ii-p3"></span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.vi.ii-p3.1"></span>Κανών</span>, as an ecclesiastical term, has
a very interesting history.  See Westcott’s account of it, *On the New
Testament Canon*, p. 498 ff.  The original sense, “a straight rod” or
“line,” determines all its religious applications, which begin with St.
Paul’s use of it for a prescribed sphere of apostolic work ([2 Cor.
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#013.md),
[15](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#015)<span id="vii.vi.ii-p3.2"></span>.md),
or a regulative principle of Christian life ([Gal. vi.
16](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#016)<span id="vii.vi.ii-p3.3"></span>.md). 
It represents the element of definiteness in Christianity and in the
order of the Christian Church.  Clement of Rome uses it for the measure
of Christian attainment (Ep. Cor. 7).  Irenæus calls the baptismal creed
“the canon of truth” (i. 9, 4):  Polycrates (Euseb. v. 24) and probably
Hippolytus (ib. v. 28) calls it “the canon of faith;” the Council of
Antioch in <span class="sc"><span id="vii.vi.ii-p3.4"></span>a.d.</span>
269, referring to the same standard of orthodox belief, speaks with
significant absoluteness of “the canon” (ib. vii. 30).  Eusebius himself
mentions “the canon of truth” in iv. 23, and “the canon of the
preaching” in iii. 32; and so Basil speaks of “the transmitted canon of
true religion” (Epist. 204–6).  Such language, like Tertullian’s “regula
fidei,” amounted to saying, “We Christians know what we believe:  it is
not a vague ‘idea’ without substance or outline:  it can be put into
form, and by it we ‘test the spirits whether they be of God.’”  Thus it
was natural for Socrates to call the Nicene Creed itself a “canon,” ii.
27.  Clement of Alexandria uses the phrase “canon of truth” for a
standard of mystic interpretation, but proceeds to call the harmony
between the two Testaments “a canon for the Church,” *Strom.* vi. 15,
124, 125.  Eusebius speaks of “the ecclesiastical canon” which
recognized no other Gospels than the four (vi. 25).  The use of the term
and its cognates in reference to the Scriptures is explained by Westcott
in a passive sense so that “canonized” books, as Athanasius calls them
(Fest. Ep. 39<span id="vii.vi.ii-p3.5"></span>), are books expressly
recognized by the Church as portions of Holy Scripture.  Again, as to
matters of observance, Clement of Alexandria wrote a book against
Judaizers, called “The Churches Canon” (Euseb. vi. 13); and Cornelius of
Rome, in his letter to Fabius, speaks of the “canon” as to what we call
confirmation (Euseb. vi. 43), and Dionysius of the “canon” as to
reception of converts from heresy (*ib*. vii. 7).  The Nicene Council in
this canon refers to a standing “canon” of discipline (comp. Nic. 2, 5,
6, 9, 10, 15, 16, 18), but it does not apply the term to its own
enactments, which are so described in the second canon of Constantinople
(see below), and of which Socrates says “that it passed what are usually
called ‘canons’” (i. 13); as Julius of Rome calls a decree of this
Council a “canon” (Athan. Apol. c. Ari. 25); so Athanasius applies the
term generally to Church laws (Encycl. 2; cp. Apol. c. Ari. 69).  The
use of <span class="Greek"><span id="vii.vi.ii-p3.6"></span>κανών</span>
for the clerical body (Nic. 16, 17, 19; Chalc. 2) is explained by
Westcott with reference to the rule of clerical life, but Bingham traces
it to the roll or official list on which the names of clerics were
enrolled (i. 5, 10); and this appears to be the more natural derivation,
see “the holy canon” in the first canon of the Council of Antioch, and
compare Socrates (i. 17), “the Virgins enumerated <span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.vi.ii-p3.7"></span>ἐν τῷ τῶν ἐκκλησιῶν
κανόνι</span>,” and (*ib.* v. 19) on the addition of a penitentiary “to
the canon of the church;” see also George of Laodicea in Sozomon, iv.
13.  Hence any cleric might be called <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.vi.ii-p3.8"></span>κανονικός</span> , see Cyril of Jerusalem,
*Procatech.* 4; so we read of “canonical singers.”  Laodicea, canon xv. 
The same notion of definiteness appears in <span id="page_10">p.
10</span> <span id="vii.vi.ii-Page_10"></span>the ritual use of the word
for a series of nine “odes” in the Eastern Church service (Neale,
*Introd. East. Ch.* ii. 832), for the central and unvarying element in
the Liturgy, beginning after the Tersanctus (Hammond, Liturgies East and
West, p. 377); or for any Church office (Ducange in v.); also in its
application to a table for the calculation of Easter (Euseb. vi. 29;
vii. 32); to a scheme for exhibiting the common and peculiar parts of
the several Gospels (as the “Eusebian canons”) and to a prescribed or
ordinary payment to a church, a use which grew out of one found in
Athanasius’ Apol. c. Ari. 60.

<span id="vii.vi.ii-p4"></span>In more recent times a tendency has
appeared to restrict the term Canon to matters of discipline, but the
Council of Treat continued the ancient use of the word, calling its
doctrinal and disciplinary determinations alike “Canons.”
