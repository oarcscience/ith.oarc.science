id="viii.v.iv.xv-p1.1"></span>Canon XV.</span>

<span id="viii.v.iv.xv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.v.iv.xv-p2.1"></span>If</span> anyone shall forsake his own
children and shall not nurture them, nor so far as in him lies, rear
them in becoming piety, but shall neglect them, under pretence of
asceticism, let him be anathema.

id="viii.v.iv.xv-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XV.</span>

<span id="viii.v.iv.xv-p5"></span>Whosoever they be that desert their
children and do not instruct them in the fear of God let them be
anathema.

<span id="viii.v.iv.xv-p7"></span>The fathers of this Synod here teach
that it is the office and duty of parents to provide for the bodily care
of their children, and also, as far as in them lies, to mould them to
the practice of piety.  And this care for their children is to be
preferred by parents to any private exercises of religion.  In this
connexion should be read the letter of St. Francis de Sales.  (*Ep*.
xxxii, Lib. 4.)

<span id="viii.v.iv.xv-p8"></span>It may perhaps be noted that this
canon has not infrequently been violated by those who are accepted as
Saints in the Church.

<span id="viii.v.iv.xv-p9"></span>This canon is found, in Isidore’s
version, in the *Corpus Juris Canonici*, Gratian’s *Decretum*, Pars I.,
Dist. xxx., c. xiv.
