id="xv.iii.iv.xvi-p1.1"></span>Canon XV.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.iv.xvi-p2"></span>(*Greek*.)

id="xv.iii.iv.xvi-p3.1"></span>Bishop</span> <span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iii.iv.xvi-p3.2"></span>Hosius</span> said:  And let us all
decree this also, that <span id="fr_398"></span>[399](#fn_398.md) if any
bishop should ordain to any order the minister of another from another
diocese without the consent of his own bishop, such an ordination should
be accounted invalid and not confirmed.  And if any take upon themselves
to do this they ought to be admonished and corrected by our brethren and
fellow-bishops.

<span id="xv.iii.iv.xvi-p5"></span>All said:  Let this decree also stand
unalterable.

decree, that if any \[bishop\] should ordain the minister of another
from another diocese without the consent and will of his own bishop, his
ordination be not ratified.  And whoever shall have taken upon himself
to do this ought to be admonished and corrected by our brethren and
fellow-bishops.

<span id="xv.iii.iv.xvi-p9"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iii.iv.xvi-p9.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XV.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.iv.xvi-p10"></span>*If one places a foreign minister
without the knowledge of his own bishop in any grade (*<span
class="Greek"><span id="xv.iii.iv.xvi-p10.1"></span>ἔμβαθμον</span>*, in
aliquo gradu), he has indeed made the appointment, but it is without
force.*

<span id="xv.iii.iv.xvi-p11"></span>This is Canon XIX. in the Latin.

<span id="xv.iii.iv.xvi-p12"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iii.iv.xvi-p12.1"></span>Hefele.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.iv.xvi-p13"></span>Fuchs, in his *Bibliothek der
Kirchenversammlungen* (Pt. II., p. 123, note 125) <span
id="fr_399"></span>[400](#fn_399.md) , thinks he has discovered a
difference between this canon and the exclusively Latin one preceding
it, in that the latter supposes the case of a bishop ordaining a foreign
cleric, over whom he has no jurisdiction, to a higher grade, with the
view of retaining him for his own diocese; while the other—fifteenth or
nineteenth canon—treats of a case where such an ordination takes place
without the ordaining bishop intending to keep the person ordained for
his own diocese.  Van Espen is of another opinion, and maintains that
both canons obviously refer to one and the same case, for which reason
the Greek text has only inserted one of them.  It is certain that the
text of both canons, as we have it, does not clearly indicate the
difference conjectured by Fuchs, but that it may easily be found there.

<span id="xv.iii.iv.xvi-p15"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iii.iv.xvi-p15.1"></span>Van Espen.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.iv.xvi-p16"></span>If the reading of all the Latins and
Greeks is decisive, this canon only treats of the ordination of those
already ministers or clerics, and so the Greek commentators Balsamon,
Zonaras, and Aristenus understood it, as is evident from their
annotations.  But Gratus, Bishop of Carthage, and Primate of Africa, in
the First Synod of Carthage testified that in this canon it was decreed,
that without the licence of his own bishop, a layman of another diocese
was not to be ordained, and this interpretation or rather extension of
the Canon, was received everywhere, as is demonstrated by the
fifty-sixth of the African Code.

<span id="xv.iii.iv.xvi-p17"></span>This together with Canon XIX. of the
Latin text are found as one in the *Corpus Juris Canonici* (Gratian’s
*Decretum*, P. I., Dist. lxxj.), c. j.
