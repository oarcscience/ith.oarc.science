<span id="xv.iii.iv.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xv.iii.iv.iii-p1.1"></span>Canon III.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.iv.iii-p2"></span>(*Greek*.)

<span id="xv.iii.iv.iii-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iii.iv.iii-p3.1"></span>Bishop</span> <span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iii.iv.iii-p3.2"></span>Hosius</span> said:  This also it is
necessary to add,—that no bishop pass from his own province to another
province in which there are bishops, unless indeed he be called by his
brethren, that we seem not to close the gates of charity.

<span id="xv.iii.iv.iii-p4"></span><span id="page_417">p. 417</span>
<span id="xv.iii.iv.iii-Page_417"></span>And this case likewise is to be
provided for, that if in any province a bishop has some matter against
his brother and fellow-bishop, neither of the two should call in as
arbiters bishops from another province.

<span id="xv.iii.iv.iii-p5"></span>But if perchance sentence be given
against a bishop in any matter and he supposes his case to be not
unsound but good, in order that the question may be reopened, let us, if
it seem good to your charity, honour the memory of Peter the Apostle,
and let those who gave judgment write to Julius, the bishop of Rome, so
that, if necessary, the case may be retried by the bishops of the
neighbouring provinces and let him appoint arbiters; but if it cannot be
shown that his case is of such a sort as to need a new trial, let the
judgment once given not be annulled, but stand good as before.

<span id="xv.iii.iv.iii-p6"></span>(*Latin*.)

<span id="xv.iii.iv.iii-p7"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iii.iv.iii-p7.1"></span>Bishop</span> <span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iii.iv.iii-p7.2"></span>Hosius</span> said:  This also it is
necessary to add,—that bishops shall not pass from their own province to
another province in which there are bishops, unless perchance upon
invitation from their brethren, that we seem not to close the door of
charity.

<span id="xv.iii.iv.iii-p8"></span>But if in any province a bishop have
a matter in dispute against his brother bishop, one of the two shall not
call in as judge a bishop from another province.

<span id="xv.iii.iv.iii-p9"></span>But if judgment have gone against a
bishop in any cause, and he think that he has a good case, in order that
the question may be reopened, let us, if it be your pleasure, honour the
memory of St. Peter the Apostle, and let those who tried the case write
to Julius, the bishop of Rome, and if he shall judge that the case
should be retried, let that be done, and let him appoint judges; but if
he shall find that the case is of such a sort that the former decision
need not be disturbed, what he has decreed shall be confirmed.  Is this
the pleasure of all?  The synod answered, It is our pleasure.

<span id="xv.iii.iv.iii-p10"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xv.iii.iv.iii-p10.1"></span>Notes.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.iv.iii-p11"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iii.iv.iii-p11.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon</span>

<span id="xv.iii.iv.iii-p12"></span>No bishop, unless called thereto,
shall pass to another city.  Moreover a bishop of the province who is
engaged in any litigation shall not appeal to outside bishops.  But if
Rome hears the cause, even outsiders may be present.

<span id="xv.iii.iv.iii-p13"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iii.iv.iii-p13.1"></span>Van Espen.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.iv.iii-p14"></span>According to the reading of
Dionysius and Isidore, as well as of the Greeks, Balsamon, Zonaras and
Aristenus, as also of Hervetus the provision is that bishops of one
province shall not pass to another in which there are <span
class="sc"><span id="xv.iii.iv.iii-p14.1"></span>not</span> bishops.

<span id="xv.iii.iv.iii-p15"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iii.iv.iii-p15.1"></span>Zonaras.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.iv.iii-p16"></span>Not only are bishops prohibited from
changing their cities, and passing from a smaller to a larger one, but
also from passing from one province to another in which there are
bishops, for the sake of doing any ecclesiastical work there unless they
are called by the bishops of that province.

<span id="xv.iii.iv.iii-p17"></span>On the phrase “if it pleases you”
the following from St. Athanasius is much to the point (cit. by Pusey,
*Councils*, p. 143).  “They \[i.e., the Council of Nice\] wrote
concerning Easter, ‘It seemed good’ as follows:  for it did then seem
good, that there should be a general compliance; but about the faith
they wrote not ‘It seemed good,’ but ‘Thus believes the Catholic
Church’; and thereupon they confessed how the faith lay, in order to
shew that their sentiments were not novel, but apostolic.”

<span id="xv.iii.iv.iii-p18"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iii.iv.iii-p18.1"></span>Tillemont.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.iv.iii-p19"></span>This form is very strong to shew
that it was a right which the Pope had not had hitherto.

<span id="xv.iii.iv.iii-p20"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iii.iv.iii-p20.1"></span>Van Espen.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.iv.iii-p21"></span>Peter de Marca (*De Concordia
Sacerdotii et Imperii*, Lib. VII., Cap. iij., § 8) says that Hosius here
proposed to the fathers to honour the memory of St. Peter that he might
the more easily lead them to consent to this new privilege; for, as De
Marca has proved, the right here bestowed upon the Roman Pontiff was
clearly unknown before.

<span id="xv.iii.iv.iii-p22"></span>It has been urged that the mention
of the pope by name, intimates clearly that the provision of these
canons of an appeal to Rome was of a purely temporary character; and
some famous authors such as Edmund Richer, of the Sorbonne, have written
in defence of this view, but Hefele quotes with great force the words of
the learned Protestant, Spittler (*Critical Examination of the Sardican
Decisions,* Spittler, *Sämmtlichen Werken*, P. viij., p. 129 sq.).

<span id="xv.iii.iv.iii-p23"></span><span id="page_418">p. 418</span>
<span id="xv.iii.iv.iii-Page_418"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iii.iv.iii-p23.1"></span>Spittler.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.iv.iii-p24"></span>It is said that these Sardican
decisions were simply provisional, and intended for the present
necessity; because Athanasius, so hardly pressed by the Arians, could
only be rescued by authorizing an appeal to the Bishop of Rome for a
final judgment.  Richer, in his *History of the General Councils*, has
elaborately defended this opinion, and Horix also has declared in its
favour.  But would not all secure use of the canons of the councils be
done away with if this distinction between provisional and permanent
synodal decisions were admitted?  Is there any sure criterion for
distinguishing those canons which were only to be provisional, from the
others which were made for all future centuries?  The Fathers of the
Synod of Sardica express themselves quite generally; is it not therefore
most arbitrary on our part to insert limitations?  It is beyond question
that these decisions were occasioned by the very critical state of the
affairs of Athanasius; but is everything only provisional that is
occasioned by the circumstances of individuals?  In this way the most
important of the ancient canons might be set aside.

<span id="xv.iii.iv.iii-p25"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iii.iv.iii-p25.1"></span>Hefele.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.iv.iii-p26"></span>According to the Greek text, and
that of Dionysius, those who had pronounced the first judgment were to
write to Rome; and Fuchs rightly adds, that they were to do this at the
desire of the condemned.  But, according to Isidore and the *Prisca*,
the right or the duty of bringing the affair before Rome, also belonged
to the neighbouring bishops.  I believe that the last interpretation has
only arisen through a mistake, from a comment belonging to the next
sentence being inserted in the wrong place.  It only remains to be
remarked here, that Isidore and the *Prisca* have not the name
Julio,…But Hardouin’s conjecture, that instead of Julio, perhaps *illi*
may be read, is entirely gratuitous, contrary to the Greek text, and
plainly only a stratagem against the Gallicans.

<span id="xv.iii.iv.iii-p27"></span>This canon is found in the *Corpus
Juris Canonici*, Gratian’s *Decretum*, Pars II., Causa VI., Quæst. iv.,
Canon j. 7, in Isidore’s version.  Dionysius’s version is quite wrong as
given by Justellus and in the Munich edition, changing the negative into
the affirmative in the phrase *ne unus de duobus*.
