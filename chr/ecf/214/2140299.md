id="x.xvi.xvii-p1.1"></span>Decree of the Synod in the Matter of
Euprepius and Cyril.</span>

<span id="x.xvi.xvii-p2"></span>(*Found in Latin only*.  Labbe and
Cossart, *Concilia*, Tom. III., col. 810.)

<span id="x.xvi.xvii-p3"></span>The petition of the most pious bishops
Euprepius and Cyril, which is set forth in the papers they offered, is
honest.  Therefore from the holy canons and the external laws, which
have from ancient custom the force of law, <span
id="fr_276"></span>[277](#fn_276.md) let no innovation be made in the
cities of Europa, but according to the ancient custom they shall be
governed by the bishops by whom they have been formerly governed.  For
since there never was a metropolitan who had power otherwise, so neither
hereafter shall there be any departure from the ancient custom.

<span id="x.xvi.xvii-p5"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="x.xvi.xvii-p5.1"></span>Note.</span>

<span id="x.xvi.xvii-p6"></span>(*Hist. of the Councils*, Vol. III., p.
77.)

<span id="x.xvi.xvii-p7"></span>Two Thracian bishops, Euprepius of Biza
(Bizya) and Cyril of Cœle, gave occasion for a decree, praying for
protection against their Metropolitan, Fritilas of Heraclea, who had
gone over to the party of John of Antioch, and at the same time for the
confirmation of the previous practice of holding two bishoprics at the
same time.  The Synod granted both.

<span id="x.xvi.xvii-p4"></span> The text, as the side note remarks,
“seems to be mutilated and depraved” in this passage, but the meaning is
clear enough as given by Hefele in the note.
