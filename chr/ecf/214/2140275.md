<span id="x.ix.xiv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="x.ix.xiv-p2.1"></span>Whosoever</span> shall not recognize that the
Word of God suffered in the flesh, that he was crucified in the flesh,
and that likewise in that same flesh he tasted death and that he is
become the first-begotten of the dead, for, as he is God, he is the life
and it is he that giveth life:  let him be anathema.

<span id="x.ix.xiv-p3"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="x.ix.xiv-p3.1"></span>Notes.</span>

<span id="x.ix.xiv-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="x.ix.xiv-p4.1"></span>Nestorius.</span>

<span id="x.ix.xiv-p5"></span>XII.

<span id="x.ix.xiv-p6"></span>If any one, in confessing the sufferings
of the flesh, ascribes these also to the Word of God as to the flesh in
which he appeared, and thus does not distinguish the dignity of the
natures; let him be anathema.

<span id="x.ix.xiv-p7"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="x.ix.xiv-p7.1"></span>St. Cyril.</span>

<span id="x.ix.xiv-p8"></span>(*Adv. Orientales*, ad XII. Quoting
Athanasius.)

<span id="x.ix.xiv-p9"></span>For if the body is of another, to him also
must the sufferings be ascribed.  But if the flesh is the Word’s (for
“The Word was made flesh”) it is necessary that the sufferings of the
flesh be called his also whose is the flesh.  But whose are the
sufferings, such especially as condemnation, flagellation, thirst, the
cross, death, and other such like infirmities of the body, his also is
the merit and the grace.  Therefore rightly and properly to none other
are these sufferings attributed than to the Lord, as also the grace is
from him; and we shall not be guilty of idolatry, but be the true <span
id="page_218">p. 218</span> <span
id="x.ix.xiv-Page_218"></span>worshippers of God, for we invoke him who
is no creature nor any common man, but the natural and true Son of God,
made man, and yet the same Lord and God and Saviour.

<span id="x.ix.xiv-p10"></span>As I think, these quotations will suffice
to the learned for the proof of the propositions advanced, the Divine
Law plainly saying that “In the mouth of two or three witnesses every
word shall be established.”  But if after this any one would still seem
to be contentious, we would say to him:  “Go thine own way.  We however
shall follow the divine Scriptures and the faith of the Holy Fathers.”

<span id="x.ix.xiv-p11"></span>The student should read at full length
all Cyril’s defence of his anathematisms, also his answers to the
criticisms of Theodoret, and to those of the Orientals, all of which
will be found in his works, and in Labbe and Cossart, *Concilia*, Tom.
III., 811 *et seqq*.
