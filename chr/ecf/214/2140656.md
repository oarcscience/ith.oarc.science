<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxxxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.cxxxiii-p1.1"></span>Canon CXXXII.  (Greek cxxxiii.)</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxxxiii-p2"></span>Concerning a bishop who removes a
man from communion who says he has confessed to the bishop alone his
crime.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxxxiii-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.cxxxiii-p3.1"></span>It</span> also seemed good that if on
any occasion a bishop said that someone had confessed to him alone a
personal crime, and that the man now denies it; let not the bishop think
that any slight is laid upon him if he is not believed on his own word
alone, although he says he is not willing to communicate with the man so
denying through a scruple of his own conscience.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxxxiii-p5"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.cxxxiii-p5.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon
CXXXII.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxxxiii-p6"></span>If a bishop says “someone has
confessed to me alone a crime,” if the someone denies it, he \[i.e. the
bishop\] is not easily to be believed.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxxxiii-p7"></span>N.B.  The word used for “someone”
in the Epitome is <span class="Greek"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.cxxxiii-p7.1"></span>πέλας</span>, which ordinarily means a
“neighbour” but may mean “any one.”  *Vide* Liddell and Scott.
