id="xv.iv.iv.iii-p1.1"></span>Canon II.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.iii-p2"></span>Of Preaching the Trinity.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.iii-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.iii-p3.1"></span>The</span> whole Council said:  By the
favour of God, by a unanimous confession the Church’s faith which
through us is handed down should be confessed in this glorious assembly
before anything else; then the ecclesiastical order of each is to be
built up and strengthened by the consent of all.  That the minds of our
brethren and fellow bishops lately elevated may be strengthened, those
things should be propounded which we have certainly received from our
fathers, as the unity of the Trinity, which we retain consecrated in our
senses, of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, which has
no difference, as we say, <span id="fr_421"></span>[422](#fn_421.md) so we
shall instruct the people of God.  Moreover by all the bishops lately
promoted it was said:  So we openly confess, so we hold, so we teach,
following the Evangelic faith and your teaching.

id="xv.iv.iv.iii-p6.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon II.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.iii-p7"></span>No difference is recognised or taught
by the decrees of the Council of Nice between the Persons of the Holy
Trinity.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.iii-p8"></span>This canon, or rather introduction, is
taken from Canon j., of the Council of Carthage held under Genethlius,
<span class="sc"><span id="xv.iv.iv.iii-p8.1"></span>a.d.</span> 387 or
390. <span id="fr_422"></span>[423](#fn_422.md)
