<span id="xvii.xxii-p4"></span>Let not other books seduce your mind: 
for many malignant writings have been disseminated.  The historical
books are twelve in number by the Hebrew count, \[then follow the names
of the books of the Old Testament but Esther is omitted, one Esdras, and
all the Deutero-Canonical books\].  Thus there are twenty-two books of
the Old Testament which correspond to the Hebrew letters.  The number of
the books of the New Mystery are Matthew, who wrote the Miracles of
Christ for the Hebrews; Mark for Italy; Luke, for Greece; John, the
enterer of heaven, <span id="fr_601"></span>[602](#fn_601.md) was a
preacher to all, then the Acts, the xiv. Epistles of Paul, the vii.
Catholic Epistles, and so you have all the books.  If there is any
beside these, do not repute it genuine.

<span id="xvii.xxii-p3"></span> Not being satisfied with Johnson, I have
supplied a translation from Beveridge.  It also is found in Aristenus’s
*Epitome*.  Balsamon has written a brief scholion adding nothing of
importance to the text.

<span id="xvii.xxii-p5"></span> This seems to imply a knowledge of the
Revelation, although it is not mentioned.
