<span id="xiv.iii.xlvi-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xiv.iii.xlvi-p1.1"></span>Canon XLV.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.xlvi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.xlvi-p2.1"></span>Whereas</span> we understand that in some
monasteries of women those who are about to be clothed with the sacred
habit are first adorned in silks and garments of all kinds, and also
with gold and jewels, by those who bring them thither, and that they
thus approach the altar and are there stripped of such a display of
wealth, and that immediately thereafter the blessing of their habit
takes place, and they are clothed with the black robe; we decree that
henceforth this shall not be done.  For it is not lawful for her who has
already of her own free will put away every <span id="page_387">p.
387</span> <span id="xiv.iii.xlvi-Page_387"></span>delight of life, and
has embraced that method of life which is according to God, and has
confirmed it with strong and stable reasons, and so has come to the
monastery, to recall to memory the things which they had already
forgotten, things of this world which perisheth and passeth away.  For
thus they raise in themselves doubts, and are disturbed in their souls,
like the tossing waves, turning hither and thither.  Moreover, they
should not give bodily evidence of heaviness of heart by weeping, but if
a few tears drop from their eyes, as is like enough to be the case, they
may be supposed by those who see them to have flowed <span
class="Greek"><span id="xiv.iii.xlvi-p2.2"></span>μὴ μᾶλλον</span> on
account of their affection (<span class="Greek"><span
id="xiv.iii.xlvi-p2.3"></span>διαθέσεως</span>, affectionem) for the
ascetic struggle rather than (<span class="Greek"><span
id="xiv.iii.xlvi-p2.4"></span>ἢ</span>) because they are quitting the
world and worldly things.

<span id="xiv.iii.xlvi-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.xlvi-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XLV.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.xlvi-p5"></span>Parents shall not deck out in silks a
daughter who has chosen the monastic life, and thus clothe her, for this
is a recalling to her mind the world she is leaving.

<span id="xiv.iii.xlvi-p6"></span>This canon is at the present day
constantly broken at the profession of Carmelites.
