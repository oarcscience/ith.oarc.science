col. 389.)

<span id="xvi.ix-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xvi.ix-p4.1"></span>Leo</span> the most renowned secretary said: 
The holy and blessed Synod know how at the last session we examined
divers sayings of the God-forsaken heretics, who had brought charges
against the holy and spotless Church of the Christians for the setting
up of the holy images.  But to-day we have in our hands the written
blasphemy of those calumniators of the Christians, that is to say, the
absurd, and easily answered, and self-convicting definition (<span
class="Greek"><span id="xvi.ix-p4.2"></span>ὅρον</span>) of the
pseudosyllogus, in all respects agreeing with the impious opinion of the
God-hated heretics.  But not only have we this, but also the artful and
most drastic refutation thereof, which the Holy Spirit had supervised. 
For it was right that this definition should be made a triumph by wise
contradictions, and should be torn to pieces with strong refutations. 
This also we submit so as to know your pleasure with regard to it.

<span id="xvi.ix-p5"></span>The holy Synod said:  Let it be read.

<span id="xvi.ix-p6"></span>John, the deacon and chancellor \[of the
most holy great Church of Constantinople, *in Lat. only*\] read.

<span id="xvi.ix-p7"></span>\[*John, the deacon, then read the orthodox
refutation, and Gregory, the bishop of Neocæsarea, the Definition of the
Mock Council, the one reading the heretical statement and the other the
orthodox answer*.\]
