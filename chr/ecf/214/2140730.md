IV. of the* Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers (*2d Series*) *pp*. 566 *and*
567.)

<span id="xvii.x-p4"></span>It has been determined by synods in Greece,
Spain, France, that they who have fallen, or been leaders of impiety
\[Arianism\], be pardoned upon repentance, but that they have not the
place of the clergy; but that they who were only drawn away by force, or
that complied for fear the people should be corrupted, have the place of
the clergy too.  Let the people who have been deceived, or forced, be
pardoned, upon repentance and pronouncing anathema against the
miscreancy of Eudoxius and Euzoius, ringleaders of the Arians (who
assert that Christ is a creature); and upon professing the faith of the
Fathers at Nice, and that no synod can prejudice that.
