<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.lxvii-p1.1"></span>Canon LXVI.  (Greek lxix.)</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxvii-p2"></span>That the Donatists are to be treated
leniently.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxvii-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.lxvii-p3.1"></span>Then</span> when all things had been
considered and treated of which seem to conduce to the advantage of the
church, the Spirit of God suggesting and admonishing us, we determined
to act leniently and pacifically with the before-mentioned men, although
they were cut off from the unity of the Lord’s body by an unruly
dissent, so that (as much as in us lies) to all those who have been
caught in the net of their communion and society, it might be known
throughout all the provinces of Africa, how they have been overcome by
miserable error, holding different opinions, “that perchance,” as the
Apostle says, when we have corrected <span
id="fr_460"></span>[461](#fn_460.md) them with gentleness, “God should
grant them repentance for the acknowledging of the truth, and that they
might be snatched out of the snares of the devil, who are led captive of
him at his will.”

<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxvii-p6"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.lxvii-p6.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon LXVI.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxvii-p7"></span>It seemed good that the Donatists
should be treated kindly and with leniency, even if they should separate
themselves from the Church, so that perchance through their respect for
our great gentleness they may be loosed from their captivity.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxvii-p8"></span>The introduction refers to the Synod
of Carthage of September 13, 401, and this canon is part of Canon j. of
that Synod.  We are indebted to the Ballerini for collecting the acts of
this Synod by a comparison of the pseudo-Isidore, Dionysius, Ferrandus
and the quotations contained in the acts of the Synod of Carthage of
525.
