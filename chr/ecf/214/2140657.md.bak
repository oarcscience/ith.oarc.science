<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxxxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.cxxxiv-p1.1"></span>Canon CXXXIII.  (Greek cxxxiv.)</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxxxiv-p2"></span>That a bishop should not rashly
deprive anyone of communion.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxxxiv-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.cxxxiv-p3.1"></span>As</span> long as his own bishop will
not communicate with one excommunicated, the other bishops should have
no communion with that bishop, that the bishop may be more careful not
to charge anyone with what he cannot prove by documentary evidence to
others.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxxxiv-p4"></span>(Greek cxxxv.)

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxxxiv-p5"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.cxxxiv-p5.1"></span>Bishop</span> <span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.cxxxiv-p5.2"></span>Aurelius</span> said:  According to the
statutes of this whole assembled council, and the opinion of my
littleness, it seems good to make an end of all the matters of the whole
of the before-manifested title, and let the ecclesiastical acts receive
the discussion of the present day’s constitution.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxxxiv-p6"></span><span id="page_506">p. 506</span>
<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxxxiv-Page_506"></span>And what things have not yet
been expressed (“treated of” in the Greek) we shall write on the next
day through our brethren, Bishop Faustinus and the Presbyters Philip and
Asellus to our venerable brother and fellow-bishop Boniface; and they
gave their assent in writing.

id="xv.iv.iv.cxxxiv-p8.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon
CXXXIII.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxxxiv-p9"></span>If a bishop deprives of communion
an unconvicted man, he shall likewise be deprived of communion with his
fellows.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxxxiv-p10"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.cxxxiv-p10.1"></span>Johnson</span>.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxxxiv-p11"></span>Never was a more impartial law
made, especially when all the legislators were bishops except two. 
There were 217 bishops, and two priests, being legates from the bishop
of Rome.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxxxiv-p12"></span>The Greeks make a canon of the
ratifications, and reckon no more than 135.  Aurelius, Bishop of
Carthage, subscribes first, and after him 217 bishops, then Asellus and
Philippus, priests, legates of the church of Rome.  And it does not
appear that any other priests were present in any of the councils,
mentioned in the body of this code; but there is several times notice
taken of the deacons who stood by.
