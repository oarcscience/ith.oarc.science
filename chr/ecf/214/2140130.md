<span id="viii.v.iv.xix-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="viii.v.iv.xix-p1.1"></span>Canon XIX.</span>

<span id="viii.v.iv.xix-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.v.iv.xix-p2.1"></span>If</span> any of the ascetics, without
bodily necessity, shall behave with insolence and disregard the fasts
commonly prescribed and observed by the Church, because of his perfect
understanding in the matter, let him be anathema.

<span id="viii.v.iv.xix-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.v.iv.xix-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XIX.</span>

<span id="viii.v.iv.xix-p5"></span>Whoso neglects the fasts of the
Church, let him be anathema.

<span id="viii.v.iv.xix-p6"></span>I have followed Hefele’s translation
of the last clause, with which Van Espen seems to agree, as well as
Zonaras.  But Hardouin and Mansi take an entirely different view and
translate “if the Eustathian deliberately rejects the Church fasts.” 
Zonoras and Balsamon both refer to the <span class="sc"><span
id="viii.v.iv.xix-p6.1"></span>LXIX</span>th of the Apostolical Canons
as being the law the Eustathians violated.  Balsamon suggests that the
Eustathians shared the error of the Bogomiles on the subject of fasting,
but I see no reason to think that this was the case; Eustathius’s action
seems rather to be attributable to pride, and a desire to be different
and original, “I thank thee that I am not as other men are,” (as Van
Espen points out).  All that Socrates says (*H. E.* II., xliii.) is that
“he commanded that the prescribed fasts should be neglected, and that
the Lord’s days should be fasted.”

<span id="viii.v.iv.xix-p7"></span>This canon is found in the *Corpus
Juris Canonici*, Gratian’s *Decretum*, Pars I., Dist. xxx., c. viii., in
an imperfect translation but not that of either Isidore or Dionysius.
