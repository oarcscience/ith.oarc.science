id="viii.vii.iii.xxxix-p1.1"></span>Canon XXXIV.</span>

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xxxix-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.vii.iii.xxxix-p2.1"></span>No</span> Christian shall forsake
the martyrs of Christ, and turn to false martyrs, that is, to those of
the heretics, or those who formerly were heretics; for they are aliens
from God.  Let those, therefore, who go after them, be anathema.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xxxix-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.vii.iii.xxxix-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon
XXXIV.</span>

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xxxix-p5"></span>Whoso honours an heretical
pseudo-martyr let him be anathema.

id="viii.vii.iii.xxxix-p6.1"></span>Hefele.</span>

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xxxix-p7"></span>This canon forbids the honouring
of martyrs not belonging to the orthodox church.  The number of
Montanist martyrs of Phrygia was probably the occasion of this canon.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xxxix-p8"></span>The phrase which I have
translated “to those who formerly were heretics” has caused great
difficulty to all translators and scarcely two agree.  Hammond reads
“those who have been reputed to have been heretics;” and with him Fulton
agrees, but wrongly (as I think) by omitting the “to.”  Lambert
translates “to those who before were heretics” and correctly.  With him
agrees Van Espen, thus, *vel eos qui prius heretici fuere*.
