<span id="viii.ii-p1"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="viii.ii-p1.1"></span>Introductory Note to the Canons of the
Provincial Synods which in this Volume are Interjected Between the First
and the Second Ecumenical Councils.</span>

<span id="viii.ii-p2"></span>The First Canon of the Fourth Ecumenical
Council, Chalcedon, reads as follows:  “We have judged it right that the
canons of the Holy Fathers made in every synod even until now, should
remain in force.”  And the Council in Trullo, in its second canon, has
enumerated these synods in the following words.  “We set our seal to all
the rest of the canons which have been established by our holy and
blessed fathers, that is to say by the 318 God-inspired fathers who met
at Nice, and by those who met at Ancyra, and by those who met at
Neocæsarea, as well as by those who met at Gangra:  in addition to these
the canons adopted by those who met at Antioch in Syria, and by those
who met at Laodicea in Phrygia; moreover by the 150 fathers who
assembled in this divinely kept and imperial city, and by the 200 who
were gathered in the metropolis of Ephesus, and by the 630 holy and
blessed fathers who met at Chalcedon,” etc., etc.

<span id="viii.ii-p3"></span>There can be no doubt that this collection
of canons was made at a very early date, and from the fact that the
canons of the First Council of Constantinople do not appear, as they
naturally would, immediately after those of Nice, we may not improbably
conclude that the collection was formed before that council assembled. 
For it will be noticed that Nice, although not the earliest in date,
takes the precedence as being of ecumenical rank.  And this is expressly
stated in the caption to the canons of Ancyra according to the reading
in the Paris Edition of Balsamon.  “The canons of the holy Fathers who
assembled at Ancyra; which are indeed older than those made at Nice, but
placed after them, on account of the authority (<span
class="Greek"><span id="viii.ii-p3.1"></span>αὐθεντίαν</span>) of the
Ecumenical Synod.”

<span id="viii.ii-p4"></span>On the arrangement of this code much has
been written and Archbishop Ussher has made some interesting
suggestions, but all appear to be attended with more or less
difficulties.  The reader will find in Bp. Beveridge, in the Prolegomena
to his *Synodicon* a very full treatment of the point, <span
id="fr_114"></span>[115](#fn_114.md) the gist of the matter is admirably
given in the following brief note which I take from Hammond.  In
speaking of this early codex of the Church he says:

<span id="viii.ii-p6"></span>(Hammond, *Definitions of Faith and Canons
of Discipline*, pp. 134 and 135.)

<span id="viii.ii-p7"></span>That this collection was made and received
by the Church previous to the Council of Chalcedon is evident from the
manner in which several of the Canons are quoted in that Council.  Thus
in the 4th Action, in the matter of Carosus and Dorotheus, who had
acknowledged Dioscorus as Bishop, though he had been deposed from his
bishopric, “the holy Synod said, let the holy Canons of the Fathers be
read, and inserted in the records; and Actius the Archdeacon taking the
book read the 83d Canon, If any Bishops, etc.  And again the 84th Canon,
concerning those who separate themselves, If any Presbyter,” etc.  These
Canons are the 4th and 5th of Antioch.  Again, in the 11th Action, in
the matter of Bassianus and Stephanus who disputed about the Bishopric
of Ephesus, both requested the Canons to be read, “And the Judges said,
Let the Canons be read.  And Leontius Bishop of Magnesia read the 95th
Canon, If any Bishop, etc., and again out of the same book the 96th
Canon, If any Bishop,” etc.  These Canons are the 16th and 17th of
Antioch.  Now if we add together the different Canons in the Code of the
Universal Church in the order in which they follow in the enumeration of
them by the Council of Trullo and in other documents, we find that the
4th and 5th of Antioch, are the 83d and 84th of the whole Code, and
<span id="page_60">p. 60</span> <span id="viii.ii-Page_60"></span>the
16th and 17th of Antioch, the 95th and 96th.  Nice 20, Ancyra 25,
Neocæsarea 14, Gangra 20; all which make 79.  Next come those of
Antioch, the 4th and 5th of which therefore will be respectively the 83d
and 84th, and the 16th and 17th the 95th and 96th.

<span id="viii.ii-p8"></span>The fact of the existence of such a code
does not prove by any means that it was the only collection extant at
the time nor that it was universally known.  In fact we have good
reason, as we shall see in connexion with the Council of Sardica, to
believe that in many codices, probably especially in the West, the
canons of that council followed immediately after those of Nice, and
that without any break or note whatever.  But we know that the number of
canons attributed to Nice must have been twenty or else the numbering of
the codex read from at Chalcedon would be quite inexplicable.  It would
naturally suggest itself to the mind that possibly the divergence in the
canonical codes was the result of the local feelings of East and West
with regard to the decrees of Sardica.  But this supposition, plausible
as it appears, must be rejected, since at the Quinisext Council, where
it is not disputed there was a strong anti-Western bias, the canons of
Sardica are expressly enumerated among those which the fathers receive
as of Ecumenical authority.  It will be noticed that the code set forth
by the Council in Trullo differs from the code used at Chalcedon by
having the so-called “Canons of the Apostles” prefixed to it, and by
having a large number of other canons, including those of Sardica,
appended, of which more will be said when treating of that Council.

<span id="viii.ii-p9"></span>The order which I have followed my justly
be considered as that of the earliest accepted *codex canonum*, at least
of the East.
