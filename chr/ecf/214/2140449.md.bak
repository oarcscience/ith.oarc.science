<span id="xiv.iii.lxvi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.lxvi-p2.1"></span>The</span> fires which are lighted on the
new moons by some before their shops and houses, upon which (according
to a certain ancient custom) they are wont foolishly and crazily to
leap, we order henceforth to cease.  Therefore, whosoever shall do such
a thing, if he be a cleric, let him be deposed; but if he be a layman,
let him be cut off.  <span id="page_395">p. 395</span> <span
id="xiv.iii.lxvi-Page_395"></span>For it is written in the Fourth Book
of the Kings “And Manasses built an altar to the whole host of heaven,
in the two courts of the Lord, and made his sons to pass through the
fire, he used lots and augurs and divinations by birds and made
ventriloquists \[or pythons <span id="fr_379"></span>[380](#fn_379.md) \]
and multiplied diviners, that he might do evil before the Lord and
provoke him to anger.” <span id="fr_380"></span>[381](#fn_380.md)

<span id="xiv.iii.lxvi-p7"></span>The fires which were made upon the new
moons at the workshops are condemned and those who leaped upon them.

<span id="xiv.iii.lxvi-p8"></span>Lupin remarks that the fires kindled
on certain Saints’ days are almost certainly remains of this heathen
practice.  These fires are often accompanied with leaping, drinking, and
the wrestling of young men.
