<span id="xv.iv.iv.xlix-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xlix-p1.1"></span>Canon XLVIII.  (Greek lii.)</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xlix-p2"></span>Of rebaptisms, reordinations, and
translations of bishops.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xlix-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xlix-p3.1"></span>But</span> we suggest that we decree what
was set forth by the wisdom of the plenary synod at Capua, that no
rebaptisings, nor reordinations should take place, and that bishops
should not be translated.  For Cresconius, bishop of Villa Regis, left
his own people and invaded the Church of Tubinia and having been
admonished down to this very day, to leave, according to the decree, the
diocese he had invaded, he treated the admonition with disdain.  We have
heard that the sentence pronounced against him has been confirmed; but
we seek, according to our decree, that ye deign to grant that being
driven thereto by necessity, it be free to us to address the rector of
the province against him, according to the statutes of the most glorious
princes, so that whoever is not willing to acquiesce in the mild
admonition of your holiness and to amend his lawlessness, shall be
immediately cast out by judicial authority.  Aurelius the bishop said: 
By the observance of the constituted form, let him not be judged to be a
member of the synod, if he has been asked by you, dear brethren, to
depart and has refused:  for out of his own contempt and contumacy he
has fallen to the power of the secular magistrate. <span
id="fr_449"></span>[450](#fn_449.md)   Honoratus and Urban the bishops
said:  This pleases us all, does it not?  And all the bishops answered: 
It is just, it pleases us.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xlix-p6"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xlix-p6.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XLVIII.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xlix-p7"></span>Let there be no rebaptisms, nor
reordinations nor translations of bishops.  Therefore let Cresconius be
forbidden by judicial authority, for he has left his own people, and has
taken possession of the diocese of Ceneum, although ecclesiastically
admonished that he was not to change.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xlix-p8"></span>This canon is Canon j., of the Synod
of Carthage of August 28th. <span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xlix-p8.1"></span>a.d.</span> 397.  The acts of this synod
were first accurately edited by the Ballerini (in their edition of the
works of St. Leo) and were printed by Mansi, in an amended form, in his
*Concilia*.
