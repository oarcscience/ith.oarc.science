<span id="xiv.iii.xxxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xiv.iii.xxxvii-p1.1"></span>Canon XXXVI.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.xxxvii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.xxxvii-p2.1"></span>Renewing</span> the enactments by the
150 Fathers assembled at the God-protected and imperial city, and those
of the 630 who met at Chalcedon; we decree that the see of
Constantinople shall have equal privileges with the see of Old Rome, and
shall be highly regarded in ecclesiastical matters as that is, and shall
be second after it.  After Constantinople shall be ranked the See of
Alexandria, then that of Antioch, and afterwards the See of Jerusalem.

<span id="xiv.iii.xxxvii-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.xxxvii-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XXXVI.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.xxxvii-p5"></span>Let the throne of Constantinople be
next after that of Rome, and enjoy equal privileges.  After it
Alexandria, then Antioch, and then Jerusalem.

<span id="xiv.iii.xxxvii-p6"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.xxxvii-p6.1"></span>Balsamon</span>.

<span id="xiv.iii.xxxvii-p7"></span>The Fathers here speak of the Second
and Third canons of the Second Synod \[i.e. I. Constantinople\] and of
canon xxviij. of the Fourth Synod \[i.e. Chalcedon\].  And read what we
have said on these canons.

<span id="xiv.iii.xxxvii-p8"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.xxxvii-p8.1"></span>Aristenus.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.xxxvii-p9"></span>We have explained the third canon of
the Synod of Constantinople and the twenty-eighth canon of the Synod of
Chalcedon as meaning, when asserting that the bishop of Constantinople
should enjoy equal privileges after the Roman bishop, that he should be
placed second from the Roman in point of time.  So here too this
preposition “after” denotes time but not honour.  For after many years
this throne of Constantinople obtained equal privileges with the Roman
Church; because it was honoured by the presence of the Emperor and of
the Senate.

<span id="xiv.iii.xxxvii-p10"></span>On this opinion of Aristenus’s the
reader is referred to the notes on Canon iij. of I. Constantinople.

<span id="xiv.iii.xxxvii-p11"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.xxxvii-p11.1"></span>Justinian.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.xxxvii-p12"></span>(*Novella* CXXXI., *Cap*. ij.)

<span id="xiv.iii.xxxvii-p13"></span>We command that according to the
definitions of the Four Councils the most holy Pope of Old Rome shall be
first of all the priests.  But the most blessed Archbishop of
Constantinople, which is New Rome, shall have the second place after the
Holy Apostolic See of Old Rome.

<span id="xiv.iii.xxxvii-p14"></span>This canon, in a mutilated form, is
found in the *Corpus Juris Canonici*, Gratian’s *Decretum*, Pars I.,
Dist. XXII., c. vj.
