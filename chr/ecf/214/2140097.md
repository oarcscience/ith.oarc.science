<span id="viii.iv.iii.vi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iv.iii.vi-p2.1"></span>Concerning</span> a woman with child, it
is determined that she ought to be baptized whensoever she will; for in
this the woman communicates nothing to the child, since the bringing
forward to profession is evidently the individual \[privilege\] of every
single person.

<span id="viii.iv.iii.vi-p5"></span>If a woman with child so desires,
let her be baptized.  For the choice of each one is judged of.

<span id="viii.iv.iii.vi-p7"></span>That the reason of the canon may be
understood it must be noted that in the first ages of the Church
catechumens were examined concerning their faith before they were
baptized, and were made publicly to confess their faith and to renounce
openly the pomps of the world, as Albaspinæus (Aubespine) observes on
this canon, “A short while before they were immersed they declared with
a loud voice that they desired baptism and wished to be baptized.  And
since these confessions could not be made by those still shut up in
their parent’s womb, to them the thing (*res*) and grace of baptism
could not come nor penetrate.”  And altogether in accord with this is
the translation of Isidore— “because the free will of each one is
declared in that confession,” that is, in that confession he declares
that he willingly desires to be baptized.
