<span id="xvi.xx-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xvi.xx-p1.1"></span>Excursus on the Convention said to have been
held in Paris, <span class="sc"><span
id="xvi.xx-p1.2"></span>a.d.</span> 825.</span>

<span id="xvi.xx-p2"></span>It is curious that besides the Caroline
Books and the second canon of Frankfort, another matter of great
difficulty springs up with regard to the subject of the authority of the
Seventh Synod.  In 1596 there appeared what claims to be an ancient
account of a convention of bishops in Paris in the year 824. <span
id="fr_553"></span>[554](#fn_553.md)   The point in which this interests us
is that the bishops at this meeting are supposed to have condemned the
Seventh Council, and to have approved the Caroline books.  The whole
story was rejected by Cardinal Bellarmine and he promptly wrote a
refutation.  Sismondi accepted this view of the matter, and Labbe has
excluded the pretended proceedings from his “Concilia” altogether.

<span id="xvi.xx-p4"></span>But while scholars are agreed that the
assigned date is impossible and that it must be 825, they have usually
accepted the facts as true, I need not mention others than such widely
differing authors as Fleury (*Hist. Eccles*., Lib. xlvij. iv.),
Roisselet de Sauclières (*Hist. Chronol*., Tome III., No. 792, p. 385),
and Hefele (*Concilien*, § 425).

<span id="xvi.xx-p5"></span>It would be the height of presumption were I
to express any opinion upon this most disputed point, the reader will
find the whole matter at length in Walch (Bd. XI., S. 135, 139).  I only
here note that if the account be genuine, then it is an established fact
that as late as 825, an assembly of bishops rejected an Ecumenical
Council accepted by the pope, and further charged the Supreme Pontiff
with having “commanded men to adore superstitiously images (*quod
superstitiose eas adorare jussit*),” and asked the reigning Pontiff to
correct the errors of his predecessors, and all this without any reproof
from the Holy See!

<span id="xvi.xx-p6"></span>Hefele points out also that they not only
entirely misrepresent the teaching of Hadrian and the Seventh Council,
but that they also cite a passage from St. Augustine, “which teaches
exactly the opposite of that which this synod would make out, for the
passage says that the word *colere* can be applied to men.”

Cardinal Bellarmine’s refutation is also found in Migne’s Charlemagne,
