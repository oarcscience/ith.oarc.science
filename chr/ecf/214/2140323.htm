<p class="c18"><a name="xi.xviii.v-p8"></A>It is supposed by Hefele that the bishops were thinking of the case of Bassian, who, in the eleventh session (Oct. 29), pleaded that he had been violently ejected from the see of Ephesus.&#160; Stephen the actual bishop, answered that Bassian had not been &#8220;ordained&#8221; for that see, but had invaded it and been justly expelled.&#160; Bassian rejoined that his original consecration for the see of Evasa had been forcible even to brutality; that he had never even visited Evasa, that therefore his appointment to Ephesus was not a translation.&#160; Ultimately, the Council cut the knot by ordering that a new bishop should be elected, Basalan and Stephen retaining the episcopal title and receiving allowances from the revenues of the see (Mansi, vii. 273 <i>et seqq</i>.)</p>
