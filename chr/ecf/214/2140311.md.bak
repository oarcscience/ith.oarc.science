<span id="xi.xi-p3"></span>(Labbe and Cossart, *Concilia*, Tom. IV.,
col. 469.)

<span id="xi.xi-p4"></span>The most magnificent and glorious judges and
the great Senate said:

<span id="xi.xi-p5"></span>Let the reverend council now declare what
seems good concerning the faith, since those things which have already
been disposed of have been made manifest.  Paschasinus and Lucentius,
the most reverend bishops, and Boniface the most reverend presbyter,
legates of the Apostolic See through that most reverend man, bishop
Paschasinus said:  As the holy and blessed and Ecumenical Synod holds
fast and follows the rule of faith (*fidei regulam* in the Latin Acts)
which was set forth by the fathers at Nice, it also confirms the faith
set forth by the Synod of 150 fathers gathered at Constantinople at the
bidding of the great Theodosius of blessed memory.  Moreover the
exposition of their faith, of the illustrious Cyril of blessed memory
set forth at the Council of Ephesus (in which Nestorius was condemned)
is received.  And in the third place the writings of that blessed man,
Leo, Archbishop of all the churches, who condemned the heresy of
Nestorius and Eutyches, shew what the true faith is.  Likewise the holy
Synod holds this faith, this it follows—nothing further can it add nor
can it take aught away.

<span id="xi.xi-p6"></span>When this had been translated into Greek by
Beronician, the devout secretary of the divine consistory, the most
reverend bishops cried out:  So we all believe, so we were baptized, so
we baptize, so we have believed, so we now believe.

<span id="xi.xi-p7"></span>The most glorious judges and the great senate
said:  Since we see that the Holy Gospels have been placed alongside of
your holiness, let each one of the bishops here assembled declare
whether the epistle of most blessed archbishop Leo is in accordance with
the exposition of the 318 fathers <span id="page_261">p. 261</span>
<span id="xi.xi-Page_261"></span>assembled at Nice and with the decrees
of the 150 fathers afterwards assembled in the royal city.

<span id="xi.xi-p8"></span>\[*To this question the bishops answered one
by one, until 161 separate opinions had been given, when the rest of the
bishops were asked by the imperial judges to give their votes in a body*
(col. 508).\]

<span id="xi.xi-p9"></span>All the most reverend bishops cried out:  We
all acquiesce, we all believe thus; we are all of the same mind.  So are
we minded, so we believe, etc., etc.
