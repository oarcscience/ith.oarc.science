<span id="xvi.xiv.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xvi.xiv.iii-p1.1"></span>Canon III.</span>

<span id="xvi.xiv.iii-p2"></span>That it does not pertain to princes to
choose a Bishop.

<span id="xvi.xiv.iii-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xvi.xiv.iii-p3.1"></span>Let</span> every election of a bishop,
presbyter, or deacon, made by princes stand null, according to the canon
which says:  If any bishop making use of the secular powers shall by
their means obtain jurisdiction over any church, he shall be deposed,
and also excommunicated, together with all who remain in communion with
him.  For he who is raised to the episcopate must be chosen by bishops,
as was decreed by the holy fathers of Nice in the canon which says:  It
is most fitting that a bishop be ordained by all the bishops in the
province; but if this is difficult to arrange, either on account of
urgent necessity, or because of the length of the journey, three bishops
at least having met together and given their votes, those also who are
absent having signified their assent by letters, the ordination shall
take place.  The confirmation of what is thus done, shall in each
province be given by the metropolitan thereof.

<span id="xvi.xiv.iii-p5"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xvi.xiv.iii-p5.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon III.</span>

<span id="xvi.xiv.iii-p6"></span>Every election made by a secular
magistrate is null.

<span id="xvi.xiv.iii-p7"></span>This is a canon of a synod recognized
by East and West as ecumenical!  The reader can hardly resist the
reflection that in this case there have been and are a great many
intruding clergymen in the world, whose appointment to their several
offices is “null.”  Van Espen, however, suggests an ingenious way out of
the difficulty, which is followed with great approval by Hefele.

<span id="xvi.xiv.iii-p9"></span>Canon xxix. of those commonly called
Apostolic, and canon iv. of Nice are renewed in this canon.

<span id="xvi.xiv.iii-p10"></span>From the words of this canon it is
sufficiently clear that in this canon the synod is treating of the
choice and intrusion of persons into ecclesiastical offices which the
magistrates and Princes had arrogated to themselves under the title of
Domination (*Dominatio*); and by no means of that choice or rather
nomination which Catholic princes and kings have everywhere and always
used.

<span id="xvi.xiv.iii-p11"></span>This canon is found in the *Corpus
Juris Canonici*, Gratian’s *Decretum*, Pars I., Dist. xciii., C. vij.
