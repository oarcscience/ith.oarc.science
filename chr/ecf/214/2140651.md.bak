<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.cxxviii-p1.1"></span>Canon CXXVII.  (Greek cxxviii.)</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxxviii-p2"></span>That bishops be not detained too
long in council, let them choose three judges from themselves of the
singular provinces.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxxviii-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.cxxviii-p3.1"></span>Item</span>, it seemed good, lest all
the bishops who are assembled at a council be kept too long, that the
whole synod should choose three judges of the several provinces; and
they elected for the province of Carthage Vincent, Fortunatian, and
Clarus; for the province of Numidia Alypius, Augustine, and Restitutus;
for the province of Byzacena, with the holy Senex Donatian the Primate,
Cresconius, Jocundus, and Æmilian; for Mauritania Sitephensis Severian,
Asiaticus, and Donatus; for the Tripolitan province Plautius, who alone
was sent as legate according to custom; all these were to take
cognizance of all things with the holy senex Aurelius, from whom the
whole council sought that he should subscribe all things done by the
council whether acts or letters.  And they subscribed:  I, Aurelius,
bishop of the church of Carthage consent to this decree and having read
it sign my name.  Likewise also signed they all.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxxviii-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.cxxviii-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon
CXXVII.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxxviii-p5"></span>Whenever the bishops who come to
synod can remain no longer in attendance, let three be chosen from each
province.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxxviii-p6"></span>This is Canon xix. of Carthage,

418.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxxviii-p8"></span>Two Sancti Senes mentioned, who we
are sure were both primates.  See can. 100 (104).

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxxviii-p9"></span>See can. 14.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxxviii-p10"></span>And here we have an ancient
precedent for synods delegating their authority to a committee, with the
primate of all Africa at the head of it.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxxviii-p11"></span>Item, at this council there was
present a legation from the Roman Church.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxxviii-p12"></span>After the consulate of the most
glorious emperors Honorius for the <span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.cxxviii-p12.1"></span>XII</span>th. time and Theodosius for
the <span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.cxxviii-p12.2"></span>VIII</span>th., Augusti, on the III.
Calends of June, at Carthage, in the Secretarium of the restored
basilica, when Aurelius the bishop together with Faustinus of the church
of Potentia in the Italian province of Picenum, a legate of the Roman
Church, Vincent of Calvita <span id="fr_482"></span>[483](#fn_482.md)
(Culositanus), Fortunatian of Naples, Marianus Uzipparen<span

Pentadius of Carpi, Rufinian of Muzuba, Prætextatus of Sicily,
Quodvultdeus of Veri (Verensis), Candidus of Abbirita, Gallonian of
Utica, legates of the proconsular province; Alypius of Tagaste,
Augustine of Hippo Regia and Posidonius of Calama, legates of the
province of Numidia; Maximian of Aquæ, Jocundus of Sufetula, and Hilary
of Horrea-Cascilia, legates of the province of Byzacena; Novatus of
Sitifi and Leo of Mocta, legates of the province of Mauritania
Sitiphensis; Ninellus of Rusucarrum, Laurence of Icosium and Numerian of
Rusgunium, legates of the Province of Mauritania Cæsariensis, the judges
chosen by the plenary council, had taken their seats, the deacons
standing by, and when, after certain things had been accomplished, many
bishops complained that it was not possible for them to wait for the
completion of the rest of the business to be treated of, and that they
must hasten to their own churches; it seemed good to the whole council,
that by all some should be chosen from each province who should remain
to finish up what was left to be done.  And it came about that those
were present whose subscriptions testify that they were present.
