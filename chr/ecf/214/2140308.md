<span id="xi.viii-p3"></span>(Labbe and Cossart, *Concilia*, Tom. IV.,
col. 368.)

<span id="xi.viii-p4"></span>After the reading of the foregoing epistle,
the most reverend bishops cried out:  This is the faith of the fathers,
this is the faith of the Apostles.  So we all believe, thus the orthodox
believe.  Anathema to him who does not thus believe.  Peter has spoken
thus through Leo.  So taught the Apostles.  Piously and truly did Leo
teach, so taught Cyril.  Everlasting be the memory of Cyril.  Leo and
Cyril taught the same thing, anathema to him who does not so believe. 
This is the true faith.  Those of us who are orthodox thus believe. 
This is the faith of the fathers.  Why were not these things read at
Ephesus \[i.e. at the heretical synod held there\]?  These are the
things Dioscorus hid away.

<span id="xi.viii-p5"></span>\[*Some explanations were asked by the
Illyrian bishops and the answers were found satisfactory, but yet a
delay of a few days was asked for, and some bishops petitioned for a
general pardon of all who had been kept out.  This proposition made
great confusion, in the midst of which the session was dissolved by the
judges*.  (Col. 371<span id="xi.viii-p5.1"></span>.)\]
