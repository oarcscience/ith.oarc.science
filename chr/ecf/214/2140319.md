<span id="xi.xviii.i-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span

canons of the Holy Fathers made in every synod even until now, should
remain in force.

<span id="xi.xviii.i-p8"></span>Before the holding of the Council of
Chalcedon, in the Greek Church, the canons of several synods, which were
held previously, were gathered into one collection and provided with
continuous numbers, and such a collection of canons, as we have seen,
lay before the Synod of Chalcedon.  As, however, most of the synods
whose canons were received into the collection, *e.g.* those of Neo<span

id="xi.xviii.i-Page_268"></span>cæsarea, Ancyra, Gangra, Antioch, were
certainly not Ecumenical Councils, and were even to some extent of
doubtful authority, such as the Antiochene Synod of 341, the
confirmation of the Ecumenical Synod was now given to them, in order to
raise them to the position of universally and unconditionally valid
ecclesiastical rules.  It is admirably remarked by the Emperor
Justinian, in his 131st Novel, cap. j.; “We honour the doctrinal decrees
of the first four Councils as we do Holy Scripture, but the canons given
or *approved* by them as we do the laws.”

<span id="xi.xviii.i-p9"></span>It seems quite impossible to determine
just what councils are included in this list, the Council in Trullo has
entirely removed this ambiguity in its second canon.

<span id="xi.xviii.i-p10"></span>This canon is found in the *Corpus
Juris Canonici*, Gratian’s *Decretum*, Pars II., Causa XXV., Quæst. 1,
can. xiv.
