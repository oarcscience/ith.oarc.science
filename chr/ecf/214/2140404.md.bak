id="xiv.iii.xxi-p1.1"></span>Canon XX.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.xxi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.xxi-p2.1"></span>It</span> shall not be lawful for a bishop
to teach publicly in any city which does not belong to him.  If any
shall have been observed doing this, let him cease from his episcopate,
but let him discharge the office of a presbyter.

<span id="xiv.iii.xxi-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.xxi-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XX.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.xxi-p5"></span>The bishop of one city shall not teach
publicly in another.  If he shall be shown to have dose so he shall be
deprived of the episcopate and shall perform the functions of a
presbyter.

<span id="xiv.iii.xxi-p6"></span>The meaning of this canon is most
obscure.  Balsamon and Zonaras think that the Bishop is not to be
deposed from his Episcopate, but only shorn of his right of executing
the Episcopal functions, so that he will virtually be reduced to a
presbyter.  Aristenus, on the other hand, considers the deposition to be
real and that this canon creates an exception to Canon XXIX. of
Chalcedon.
