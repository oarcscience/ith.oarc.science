<span id="xi.xviii.xxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xi.xviii.xxviii-p1.1"></span>Canon XXVIII.</span>

<span id="xi.xviii.xxviii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xi.xviii.xxviii-p2.1"></span>Following</span> in all things the
decisions of the holy Fathers, and acknowledging the canon, which has
been just read, of the One Hundred and Fifty Bishops beloved-of-God (who
assembled in the imperial city of Constantinople, which is New Rome, in
the time of the Emperor Theodosius of happy memory), we also do enact
and decree the same things concerning the privileges of the most holy
Church of Constantinople, which is New Rome.  For the Fathers rightly
granted privileges to the throne of old Rome, because it was the royal
city.  And the One Hundred and Fifty most religious Bishops, actuated by
the same consideration, gave equal privileges (<span class="Greek"><span
id="xi.xviii.xxviii-p2.2"></span>ἴσα πρεσβεῖα</span>) to the most holy
throne of New Rome, justly judging that the city which is honoured with
the Sovereignty and the Senate, and enjoys equal privileges with the old
imperial Rome, should in ecclesiastical matters also be magnified as she
is, and rank next after her; so that, in the Pontic, the Asian, and the
Thracian dioceses, the metropolitans only and such bishops also of the
Dioceses aforesaid as are among the barbarians, should be ordained by
the aforesaid most holy throne of the most holy Church of
Constantinople; every metropolitan of the aforesaid dioceses, together
with the bishops of his province, ordaining his own provincial bishops,
as has been declared by the divine canons; but that, as has been above
said, the metropolitans of the aforesaid Dioceses should be ordained by
the archbishop of Constantinople, after the proper elections have been
held according to custom and have been reported to him.

<span id="xi.xviii.xxviii-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xi.xviii.xxviii-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XXVIII.</span>

<span id="xi.xviii.xxviii-p5"></span>The bishop of New Rome shall enjoy
the same honour as the bishop of Old Rome, on account of the removal of
the Empire.  For this reason the \[metropolitans\] of Pontus, of Asia,
and of Thrace, as well as the Barbarian bishops shall be ordained by the
bishop of Constantinople.

<span id="xi.xviii.xxviii-p7"></span>It is certain that this canon was
expressly renewed by canon xxxvi. of the Council of Trullo and from that
time has been numbered by the Greeks among the canons; and at last it
was acknowledged by some Latin collectors also, and was placed by
Gratian in his *Decretum*, although clearly with a different sense. 
(Pars I., Dist. xxii., C. vj.)

<span id="xi.xviii.xxviii-p8"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xi.xviii.xxviii-p8.1"></span>Bright.</span>

<span id="xi.xviii.xxviii-p9"></span>Here is a great addition to the
canon of 381, so ingeniously linked on to it as to seem at first sight a
part of it.  The words <span class="Greek"><span
id="xi.xviii.xxviii-p9.1"></span>καὶ ὥστε</span> are meant to suggest
that what follows is in fact involved in what has preceded:  whereas a
new point of departure is here taken, and instead of a mere “honorary
pre-eminence” the bishop of Constantinople acquires a vast jurisdiction,
the independent authority of three exarchs being annulled in order to
make him patriarch.  Previously he had <span class="Greek"><span
id="xi.xviii.xxviii-p9.2"></span>προεδρία</span> now he gains <span
class="Greek"><span id="xi.xviii.xxviii-p9.3"></span>προστασία</span>. 
As we have <span id="page_288">p. 288</span> <span
id="xi.xviii.xxviii-Page_288"></span>seen, a series of aggrandizements
in fact had prepared for this aggrandizement in law; and various
metropolitans of Asia Minor expressed their contentment at seeing it
effected.  “It is, indeed, more than probable that the self-assertion of
Rome excited the jealousy of her rival of the East,” and thus “Eastern
bishops secretly felt that the cause of Constantinople was theirs”
(Gore’s *Leo the Great*, p. 120); but the gratification of
Constantinople ambition was not the less, in a canonical sense, a
novelty, and the attempt to enfold it in the authority of the Council of
381 was rather astute than candid.  The true plea, whatever might be its
value, was that the Council had to deal with a *fait accompli*, which it
was wise at once to legalize and to regulate; that the “boundaries of
the respective exarchates…were ecclesiastical arrangements made with a
view to the general good and peace of the Church, and liable to vary
with the dispensations to which the Church was providentially
subjected,” so that “by confirming the <span class="Greek"><span
id="xi.xviii.xxviii-p9.4"></span>ἐκ πολλοῦ κρατῆσαν ἔθος</span> in
regard to the ordination of certain metropolitans (see *Ep. of Council*
to Leo, Leon. *Epist*. xcviij., 4), “they were acting in the spirit,
while violating the letter, of the ever-famous rule of Nicæa, <span
class="Greek"><span id="xi.xviii.xxviii-p9.5"></span>τὰ αρχεῖα ἔθη
κρατείτο</span> (cp. Newman, Transl. of Fleury, iii., 407).  It is
observable that Aristenus <span id="fr_294"></span>[295](#fn_294.md) and
Symeon, Logothetes reckon this decree as a <span class="sc"><span
id="xi.xviii.xxviii-p10.1"></span>XXIX</span>th canon (Justellus, ii.,
694, 720).

<span id="xi.xviii.xxviii-p11"></span>After the renewal of this canon by
the Council of Trullo, Gratian adds “The <span class="sc"><span
id="xi.xviii.xxviii-p11.1"></span>VIII</span>th Synod held under Pope
Hadrian II., canon xxj.”  (*Decretum* Pars I., Dist. xxij., C. vij.) 
“We define that no secular power shall hereafter dishonour anyone of
these who rule our patriarchal sees, or attempt to move them from their
proper throne, but shall judge them worthy of all reverence and honour;
chiefly the most holy Pope of Old Rome, and then the Patriarch of
Constantinople, and then those of Alexandria, and Antioch, and
Jerusalem.”

<span id="xi.xviii.xxviii-p12"></span>Some Greek codices have the
following heading to this canon.

<span id="xi.xviii.xxviii-p13"></span>“Decree of the same holy Synod
published on account of the privileges of the throne of the most holy
Church of Constantinople.”

<span id="xi.xviii.xxviii-p14"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xi.xviii.xxviii-p14.1"></span>Tillemont.</span>

<span id="xi.xviii.xxviii-p15"></span>This canon seems to recognise no
particular authority in the Church of Rome, save what the Fathers had
granted it, as the seat of the empire.  And it attributes in plain words
as much to Constantinople as to Rome, with the exception of the first
place.  Nevertheless I do not observe that the Popes took up a thing so
injurious to their dignity, and of so dangerous a consequence to the
whole Church.  For what Lupus quotes of St. Leo’s lxxviij. (civ.)
letter, refers rather to Alexandria and to Antioch, than to Rome.  St.
Leo is contented to destroy the foundation on which they built the
elevation of Constantinople, maintaining that a thing so entirely
ecclesiastical as the episcopate ought not to be regulated by the
temporal dignity of cities, which, nevertheless, has been almost always
followed in the establishment of the metropolis, according to the
Council of Nicea.

<span id="xi.xviii.xxviii-p16"></span>St. Leo also complains that the
Council of Chalcedon broke the decrees of the Council of Nice, the
practice of antiquity, and the rights of Metropolitans.  Certainly it
was an odious innovation to see a Bishop made the chief, not of one
department but of three; for which no example could be found save in the
authority which the Popes took over Illyricum, where, however, they did
not claim the power to ordain any Bishop.
