<span id="viii.vii.iii.xlvii-p7"></span>(On Canon xli.)

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xlvii-p8"></span>It is well known that according
to the true discipline of the Church no one should be ordained unless he
be attached to some church, which as an ecclesiastical soldier he shall
fight for and preserve.  As, then, a secular soldier cannot without his
prefect’s bidding leave his post and go to another, so the canons decree
that no one in the ranks of the ecclesiastical military can travel about
except at the bidding of the bishop who is in command of the army.  A
slight trace of this discipline is observed even to-day in the fact that
priests of other dioceses are not allowed to celebrate unless they are
provided with Canonical letters or testimonials from their own bishops.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xlvii-p9"></span>(On Canon xlii.)

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xlvii-p10"></span>The whole subject of
Commendatory and other letters is treated of in the note to Canon VIII.
of the Council of Antioch.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xlvii-p11"></span>Canon xlj. is found in the
*Corpus Juris Canonici*, Gratian’s *Decretum*, Pars III., Dist. V., *De
Consecrat*, can. xxxvj.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xlvii-p12"></span>Canon xlij. is appended to the
preceding, but, curiously enough, limited to laymen, reading as
follows:  “a layman also without canonical letters,” that is “formed
letters,” should not travel anywhere.  The Roman Correctors remark that
in the Greek order this last is canon xli., and the former part of
Gratian’s canon, canon xlij. of the Greek, but such is not the order of
the Greek in Zonaras nor in Balsamon.  The correctors add that in
neither canon is there any mention made of laymen, nor in Dionysius’s
version; the *Prisca*, however, read for canon xlj., “It is not right
for a minister of the altar, even for a layman, to travel, etc.”
