<span id="viii.iii.iii.viii-p7"></span>This canon shews how in the
Church it was a received principle that greater penances ought to be
imposed for the frequent commission of the same crime, and consequently
it was then believed that the number of times the sin had been committed
should be expressed in confession, that the penance might correspond to
the sin, greater or less as the case may be, and the time of probation
be accordingly protracted or remitted.
