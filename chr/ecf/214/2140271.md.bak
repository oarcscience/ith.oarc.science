<span id="x.ix.x-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="x.ix.x-p2.1"></span>If</span> any man shall say that the one Lord
Jesus Christ was glorified by the Holy Ghost, so that he used through
him a power not his own and from him received power against unclean
spirits and power to work miracles before men and shall not rather
con<span id="page_215">p. 215</span> <span
id="x.ix.x-Page_215"></span>fess that it was his own Spirit through
which he worked these divine signs; let him be anathema.

<span id="x.ix.x-p6"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="x.ix.x-p6.1"></span>If</span> anyone says that the form of a servant
is of like nature with the Holy Ghost, and not rather that it owes its
union with the Word which has existed since the conception, to his
mediation, by which it works miraculous healings among men, and
possesses the power of expelling demons; let him be anathema.

<span id="x.ix.x-p8"></span>The scope of this anathematism is to shew
that the Word of God, when he assumed flesh remaining what he was, and
lacking nothing which the Father possessed except only paternity, had as
his own the Holy Spirit which is from him and substantially abides in
him.  From this it follows that through him, as through a power and
strength which was his own, and not one alien or adventitious, he
wrought his wonders and cast forth devils, but he did not receive that
Holy Spirit and his power as formerly the Prophets had done, or as
afterwards his disciples did, as a kind of gift (*beneficii loco*).

<span id="x.ix.x-p9"></span>The Orientals objected that St. Cyril here
contradicts himself, for here he says that Christ did not work his
wonders by the Holy Ghost and in another place he frankly confesses that
he did so work them.  But the whole point is what is intended by working
through the Holy Ghost.  For the Apostles worked miracles through the
Holy Ghost but as by a power external to themselves, but not so Christ. 
When Christ worked wonders through the Holy Ghost, he was working
through a power which was his own, viz.:  the Third Person of the Holy
Trinity; from whom he never was and never could be separated, ever
abiding with him and the Eternal Father in the Divine Unity.

<span id="x.ix.x-p10"></span>The Westerns have always pointed to this
anathematism as shewing that St. Cyril recognized the eternal relation
of the Holy Spirit as being from the Son.
