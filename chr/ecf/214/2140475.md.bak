id="xiv.iii.xcii-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XCI.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.xcii-p5"></span>Whoever gives or receives medicine to
produce abortion is a homicide.

<span id="xiv.iii.xcii-p6"></span>See Canon XXI. of Ancyra, and Canon
II. of St. Basil; to wit, “She who purposely destroys the fœtus, shall
suffer the punishment of murder.  And we pay no attention to the subtile
distinction as to whether the fœtus was formed or unformed.  And by this
not only is justice satisfied for the child that should have been born,
but also for her who prepared for herself the snares, since the women
very often die who make such experiments.”
