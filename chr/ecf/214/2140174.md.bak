<span id="viii.vii.iii.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="viii.vii.iii.viii-p1.1"></span>Canon VII.</span>

<span id="viii.vii.iii.viii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.vii.iii.viii-p2.1"></span>Persons</span> converted from
heresies, that is, of the Novatians, Photinians, and Quartodecimans,
whether they were catechumens or communicants among them, shall not be
received until they shall have anathematized every heresy, and
particularly that in which they were held; and afterwards those who
among them were called communicants, having thoroughly learned the
symbols of the faith, and having been anointed with the holy chrism,
shall so communicate in the holy Mysteries.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.viii-p3"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="viii.vii.iii.viii-p3.1"></span>Notes.</span>

<span id="viii.vii.iii.viii-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.vii.iii.viii-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon VII.</span>

<span id="viii.vii.iii.viii-p5"></span>Novatians and Photinians, and
Quartodecimans, unless they anathemathize their own and other heresies,
are not to be received.  When they have been anointed, after their
abjuration, let them communicate.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.viii-p6"></span>I have allowed the word
“Photinians” to stand in the text although whether it is not an
interpolation is by no means certain.  They certainly were heretical on
the doctrine of the Holy Trinity, and therefore differed from the other
dissidents mentioned in the canon, all of whom were orthodox on this
matter.  It is also worthy of note that the word is not found in
Ferrandus’s Condensation (*Breviatio Canonum*, n. 177) nor in Isidore’s
version.  Moreover there is a Latin codex in Lucca, and also one in
Paris (as is noted by Mansi, v. 585; ij. 591) in which it is lacking. 
It was rejected by Baronius, Binius, and Remi Ceillier.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.viii-p7"></span>The word “Catechumens” is wanting
in many Greek <span class="sc"><span
id="viii.vii.iii.viii-p7.1"></span>mss.</span> but found in Balsamon,
moreover, Dionysius and Isidore had it in their texts.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.viii-p8"></span>This canon possesses a great
interest and value to the student from a different point of view.  Its
provisions, both doctrinal and disciplinary, are in contrariety with the
provisions of the council held at Carthage in the time of St. Cyprian,
and yet both these canons, contradictory as they are, are accepted by
the Council in Trullo and are given such ecumenical authority as canons
on discipline ever can possess, by the Seventh Ecumenical.  This is not
<span id="page_128">p. 128</span> <span
id="viii.vii.iii.viii-Page_128"></span>the only matter in which the
various conciliar actions adopted and ratified do not agree *inter se*,
and from this consideration it would seem evident that it was not
intended that to each particular of each canon of each local synod
adopted, the express sanction of the Universal Church was given, but
that they were received in block as legislation well calculated for the
good of the Church.  And that this must have been the understanding at
the time is evinced by the fact that while the Trullan canons condemned
a number of Western customs and usages, as I shall have occasion to
point out in its proper place, no objection was made by the Roman
legates to the canon of the Seventh Ecumenical which received them as
authoritative.
