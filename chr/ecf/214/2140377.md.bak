<span id="xiii.xii-p1"></span> <span id="page_349">p. 349</span> <span
id="xiii.xii-Page_349"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xiii.xii-p1.1"></span>Letter of the Council to St. Agatho.</span>

<span id="xiii.xii-p2"></span>(*Found in Migne*, Pat. Lat., *Tom.
LXXXVII., col. 1247 et seqq.; and Labbe and Cossart*, Concilia, *Tom.
VI., col. 1071 et seqq*.)

<span id="xiii.xii-p3"></span>A copy of the letter sent by the holy and
Ecumenical Sixth Council to Agatho, the most blessed and most holy pope
of Old Rome.

<span id="xiii.xii-p4"></span>The holy and ecumenical council which by
the grace of God and the pious sanction of the most pious and faithful
Constantine, the great Emperor, has been gathered together in this
God-preserved and royal city, Constantinople, the new Rome, in the
*Secretum* of the imperial (<span class="Greek"><span
id="xiii.xii-p4.1"></span>θείου</span>, sacri) palace called Trullus, to
the most holy and most blessed pope of Old Rome, Agatho, health in the
Lord.

<span id="xiii.xii-p5"></span>Serious illnesses call for greater helps,
as you know, most blessed \[father\]; and therefore Christ our true God,
who is the creator and governing power of all things, gave a wise
physician, namely your God-honoured sanctity, to drive away by force the
contagion of heretical pestilence by the remedies of orthodoxy, and to
give the strength of health to the members of the church.  Therefore to
thee, as to the bishop of the first see of the Universal Church, we
leave what must be done, since you willingly take for your standing
ground the firm rock of the faith, as we know from having read your true
confession in the letter sent by your fatherly beatitude to the most
pious emperor:  and we acknowledge that this letter was divinely written
(*perscriptas*) as by the Chief of the Apostles, and through it we have
cast out the heretical sect of many errors which had recently sprung up,
having been urged to making a decree by Constantine who divinely reigns,
and wields a most clement sceptre.  And by his help we have overthrown
the error of impiety, having as it were laid siege to the nefarious
doctrine of the heretics.  And then tearing to pieces the foundations of
their execrable heresy, and attacking them with spiritual and paternal
arms, and confounding their tongues that they might not speak
consistently with each other, we overturned the tower built up by these
followers of this most impious heresy; and we slew them with anathema,
as lapsed concerning the faith and as sinners, in the morning outside
the camp of the tabernacle of God, that we may express ourselves after
the manner of David, <span id="fr_333"></span>[334](#fn_333.md) in
accordance with the sentence already given concerning them in your
letter, and their names are these:  Theodore, bishop of Pharan, Sergius,
Honorius, Cyrus, Paul, Pyrrhus and Peter.  Moreover, in addition to
these, we justly subjected to the anathema of heretics those also who
live in their impiety which they have received, or, to speak more
accurately, in the impiety of these God-hated persons, Apollinaris,
Severus and Themestius, to wit, Macarius, who was the bishop of the
great city of Antioch (and him we also stripped deservedly of his
pastor’s robes on account of his impenitence concerning the orthodox
faith and his obstinate stubbornness), and Stephen, his disciple in
craziness and his teacher in impiety, also Polychronius, who was
inveterate in his heretical doctrines, thus answering to his name; and
finally all those who impenitently have taught or do teach, or now hold
or have held similar doctrines.

<span id="xiii.xii-p7"></span>Up to now grief, sorrow, and many tears
have been our portion.  For we cannot laugh at the fall of our
neighbours, nor exult with joy at their unbridled madness, nor have we
been elated that we might fall all the more grievously because of this
thing; not thus, O venerable and sacred head, have we been taught, we
who hold Christ, the Lord of the universe, to be both benign and
man-loving in the highest degree; for he exhorts us to be imitators of
him in his priesthood so far as is possible, as becometh the good, and
to obtain the pattern of his pastoral and conciliatory government.  But
also to true repentance the most Serene Emperor and ourselves have
exhorted them in various ways, and we have conducted the whole matter
with great religiousness and care.  Nor <span id="page_350">p.
350</span> <span id="xiii.xii-Page_350"></span>have we been moved to do
so for the sake of gain, nor by hatred, as you can easily see from what
things have been done in each session, and related in the minutes, which
are herewith sent to your blessedness:  and you will understand from
your holiness’s vicars, Theodore and George, presbyters beloved of God,
and from John, the most religious deacon, and from Constantine, the most
venerable sub-deacon, all of them your spiritual children and our
well-loved brethren.  So too you will hear the same things from those
sent by your holy synod, the holy bishops who rightly and uprightly, in
accordance with your discipline, decreed with us in the first chapter of
the faith.

<span id="xiii.xii-p8"></span>Thus, illuminated by the Holy Spirit, and
instructed by your doctrine, we have cast forth the vile doctrines of
impiety, making smooth the right path of orthodoxy, being in every way
encouraged and helped in so doing by the wisdom and power of our most
pious and serene Emperor Constantine.  And then one of our number, the
most holy præsul of this reigning Constantinople, in the first place
assenting to the orthodox compositions sent by you to the most pious
emperor as in all respects agreeable to the teaching of the approved
Fathers and of the God-instructed Fathers, and of the holy five
universal councils, we all, by the help of Christ our God, easily
accomplished what we were striving after.  For as God was the mover, so
God also he crowned our council.

<span id="xiii.xii-p9"></span>Thereupon, therefore, the grace of the
Holy Spirit shone upon us, displaying his power, through your assiduous
prayers, for the uprooting of all weeds and every tree which brought not
forth good fruit, and giving command that they should be consumed by
fire.  And we all agree both in heart and tongue, and hand, and have put
forth, by the assistance of the life-giving Spirit, a definition, clean
from all error, certain, and infallible; not ‘removing the ancient
landmarks,’ as it is written (God forbid!), but remaining steadfast in
the testimonies and authority of the holy and approved fathers, and
defining that, as of two and in two natures (to wit, the divinity and
the humanity) of which he is composed and in which he exists, Christ our
true God is preached by us, and is glorified inseparably, unchangeably,
unconfusedly, and undividedly; just so also we predicate of him two
natural operations, undividedly, incontrovertibly, unconfusedly,
inseparably, as has been declared in our synodal definition.  These
decrees the majesty of our God-copying Emperor assented to, and
subscribed them with his own hand.  And, as has been said, we rejected
and condemned that most impious and unsubstantial heresy which affirmed
but one will and one operation in the incarnate Christ our true God, and
by so doing we have pressed sore upon the crowd who confound and who
divide, and have extinguished the inflamed storm of other heresies, but
we have set forth clearly with you the shining light of the orthodox
faith, and we pray your paternal sanctity to confirm our decree by your
honourable rescript; through which we confide in good hope in Christ
that his merciful kindness will grant freely to the Roman State,
committed to the care of our most clement Emperor, stability; and will
adorn with daily yokes and victories his most serene clemency; and that
in addition to the good things he has here bestowed upon us, he will set
your God-honoured holiness before his tremendous tribunal as one who has
sincerely confessed the true faith, preserving it unsullied and keeping
good ward over the orthodox flocks committed to him by God.

<span id="xiii.xii-p10"></span>We and all who are with us salute all the
brethren in Christ who are with your blessedness.
