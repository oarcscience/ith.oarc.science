<p class="c18"><a name="v.i-p3"></A><span class="sc"><a name="v.i-p3.1"></A>From</span> the presses of the East, especially those at Athens, a number of editions more or less complete of the Greek text of the Canons of the Ecumenical and of the Local Councils have been issued, and the notes of Balsamon, Zonaras, and Aristenus have been added in some cases.&#160; Professor Bolotoff writes however that so far as Greek literature on the subject is concerned, with the exception of purely topographical researches in the environs of Constantinople, it is simply putting into Greek what was originally in German.</p> 
<p class="c19"><a name="v.i-p4"></A>The Russian Church has done somewhat more and as will be seen from the following table, some attempts have been made at providing scholia, but when the scheme of this present work was shewn him, Professor Bolotoff said:&#160; &#8220;We have nothing analogous to this undertaking in Russia.&#8221;&#160; The learned professor remarks that all the best Russian literature upon the subject is contained in magazine articles, especially those of Professor Zaozersky of the Moscow Theological Academy, and of Professor A. S. Pavloff, of the University of Moscow; he mentions also the latter&#146;s article in the <i>Orthodox Review</i>, and adds that &#8220;An Essay on a Course of Church Legislation,&#8221; by Joann Smolensk (St. Petersburg, 1851) should be referred to.</p>
