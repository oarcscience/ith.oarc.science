<span id="xiv.iii.xlv-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xiv.iii.xlv-p1.1"></span>Canon XLIV.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.xlv-p2"></span>A <span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.xlv-p2.1"></span>monk</span> convicted of fornication, or
who takes a wife for the communion of matrimony and for society, is to
be subjected to the penalties of fornicators, according to the canons.

<span id="xiv.iii.xlv-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.xlv-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XLIV.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.xlv-p5"></span>A monk joined in marriage or committing
fornication shall pay the penalty of a fornicator.

<span id="xiv.iii.xlv-p6"></span>The punishment here seems too light, so
that Balsamon thinks that this canon only refers to such monks as freely
confess their sin and desist from it, remaining in their monasteries;
and that the sterner penalties assigned to unchaste religious by other
synods (notably Chalcedon, can. xvj., and Ancyra, can. xix.) are for
such as do not confess their faults but are after some time convicted of
them.

<span id="xiv.iii.xlv-p7"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.xlv-p7.1"></span>Aristenus.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.xlv-p8"></span>The monk will receive the same
punishment whether he be a fornicator or has joined himself with a woman
for the communion of marriage.

<span id="xiv.iii.xlv-p9"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.xlv-p9.1"></span>Van Espen.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.xlv-p10"></span>It is very likely from this canon that
the Monastic vow at the time of this Synod was not yet an *impedimentum
dirimens* of matrimony, for nothing is said about the dissolution of the
marriage contracted by a monk although he had gravely sinned in
violating his faith pledged to God.
