<span id="xvii.xix-p3"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.xix-p3.1"></span>Canon XCII.</span>

<span id="xvii.xix-p4"></span>He speaks of the written doctrine, and the
unwritten tradition of the Apostles, and says, that both have the same
efficacy as to religion.  The unwritten traditions which he mentions,
are the signing those who hope in Christ with the Cross; praying toward
the East, to denote, that we are in quest of Eden, that garden in the
East from whence our first parents were ejected (as he afterwards
explains it), the words of invocation at the consecration of the Bread
of Eucharist, and the cup of eulogy; the benediction of the baptismal
water, the chrism and of the baptized person; the trine immersion, and
the renunciations made at baptism; all which the Fathers concealed from
those who were not initiated.  He says the dogmata were always kept
secret, the *Kerugmata* published; he adds the tradition of standing at
prayer on the first day of the week, and the whole Pentecost (that is,
from Easter to Whitsunday), not only to denote our rising with Christ,
but as a prefiguration of our expecting an eternal perfect day, for the
enjoyment of which we erect ourselves; and lastly, the profession of our
faith in Father, Son and Holy Ghost at baptism.

<span id="xvii.xix-p5"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.xix-p5.1"></span>Canon XCIII.</span>

<span id="xvii.xix-p6"></span>He asserts the Doxology \[in these words\]
“with the Holy Spirit,” to be an unwritten, Apostolic tradition.  For
this is a dogma full of authority, venerable for its antiquity.
