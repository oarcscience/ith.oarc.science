id="vii.iv-p1.3"></span>. <span id="fr_51"></span>[52](#fn_51) </span>

<span id="vii.iv-p3"></span>The Fathers of the Council at Nice were at
one time ready to accede to the request of some of the bishops and use
only scriptural expressions in their definitions.  But, after several
attempts, they found that all these were capable of being explained
away.  Athanasius describes with much wit and penetration how he saw
them nodding and winking to each other when the orthodox proposed
expressions which they had thought of a way of escaping from the force
of.  After a series of attempts of this sort it was found that something
clearer and more unequivocal must be adopted if real unity of faith was
to be attained; and accordingly the word *homousios* was adopted.  Just
what the Council intended this <span id="page_4">p. 4</span> <span
id="vii.iv-Page_4"></span>expression to mean is set forth by St.
Athanasius as follows:  “That the Son is not only like to the Father,
but that, as his image, he is the same as the Father; that he is of the
Father; and that the resemblance of the Son to the Father, and his
immutability, are different from ours:  for in us they are something
acquired, and arise from our fulfilling the divine commands.  Moreover,
they wished to indicate by this that his generation is different from
that of human nature; that the Son is not only like to the Father, but
inseparable from the substance of the Father, that he and the Father are
one and the same, as the Son himself said:  ‘The Logos is always in the
Father, and, the Father always in the Logos,’ as the sun and its
splendour are inseparable.” <span id="fr_52"></span>[53](#fn_52)

<span id="vii.iv-p5"></span>The word *homousios* had not had, although
frequently used before the Council of Nice, a very happy history.  It
was probably rejected by the Council of Antioch, <span
id="fr_53"></span>[54](#fn_53) and was suspected of being open to a
Sabellian meaning.  It was accepted by the heretic Paul of Samosata and
this rendered it very offensive to many in the Asiatic Churches.

<span id="vii.iv-p7"></span>On the other hand the word is used four
times by St. Irenæus, and Pamphilus the Martyr is quoted as asserting
that Origen used the very word in the Nicene sense.  Tertullian also
uses the expression “of one substance” (*unius substantiæ*) in two
places, and it would seem that more than half a century before the
meeting of the Council of Nice, it was a common one among the Orthodox.

<span id="vii.iv-p8"></span>Vasquez treats this matter at some length in
his *Disputations*, <span id="fr_54"></span>[55](#fn_54) and points out
how well the distinction is drawn by Epiphanius between *Synousios* and
*Homousios*, “for *synousios* signifies such an unity of substance as
allows of no distinction:  wherefore the Sabellians would admit this
word:  but on the contrary *homousios* signifies the same nature and
substance but with a distinction between persons one from the other. 
Rightly, therefore, has the Church adopted this word as the one best
calculated to confute the Arian heresy.” <span
id="fr_55"></span>[56](#fn_55)

<span id="vii.iv-p11"></span>It may perhaps be well to note that these
words are formed like <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.iv-p11.1"></span>ὁμόβιος</span> and <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.iv-p11.2"></span>ὁμοιόβιος, ὁμογνώμων</span> and <span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.iv-p11.3"></span>ὁμοιογνώμων</span>, etc.,
etc.

<span id="vii.iv-p12"></span>The reader will find this whole doctrine
treated at great length in all the bodies of divinity; and in Alexander
Natalis (*H. E*. t. iv., Diss. xiv.); he is also referred to Pearson,
*On the Creed*; Bull, *Defence of the Nicene Creed*; Forbes, *An
Explanation of the Nicene Creed*; and especially to the little book,
written in answer to the recent criticisms of Professor Harnack, by H.
B. Swete, D.D., *The Apostles’ Creed*.

<span id="fn_51"></span>[3:52](2140016.htm#fr_51) <span
id="vii.iv-p1.4"></span>

<span id="vii.iv-p2"></span> Our older English writers usually wrote
this word “<span id="vii.iv-p2.1"></span>homoousion,” and thus spoke of
the doctrine as “the doctrine of the <span
id="vii.iv-p2.2"></span>homoousion.”  For the Arian word they wrote
“<span id="vii.iv-p2.3"></span>homoiousion.”  Later writers have used
the nominative masculine, “<span id="vii.iv-p2.4"></span>homoousios” and
“<span id="vii.iv-p2.5"></span>homoiousios.”  The great Latin writers
did not thus transliterate the word, but, wrote “<span
id="vii.iv-p2.6"></span>homousios,” and for the heretical word “<span
id="vii.iv-p2.7"></span>homoœsios” or “<span
id="vii.iv-p2.8"></span>homœsios.”  I have kept for the noun signifying
the doctrine, our old English “<span
id="vii.iv-p2.9"></span>Homoousion,” but for the adjective, I have used
the ordinary latinized form “<span id="vii.iv-p2.10"></span>homousios,”

that the Father and the Son are of the same nature.”
