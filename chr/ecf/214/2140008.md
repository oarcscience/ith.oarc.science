<span id="v.i-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="v.i-p3.1"></span>From</span> the presses of the East, especially
those at Athens, a number of editions more or less complete of the Greek
text of the Canons of the Ecumenical and of the Local Councils have been
issued, and the notes of Balsamon, Zonaras, and Aristenus have been
added in some cases.  Professor Bolotoff writes however that so far as
Greek literature on the subject is concerned, with the exception of
purely topographical researches in the environs of Constantinople, it is
simply putting into Greek what was originally in German.

<span id="v.i-p4"></span>The Russian Church has done somewhat more and
as will be seen from the following table, some attempts have been made
at providing scholia, but when the scheme of this present work was shewn
him, Professor Bolotoff said:  “We have nothing analogous to this
undertaking in Russia.”  The learned professor remarks that all the best
Russian literature upon the subject is contained in magazine articles,
especially those of Professor Zaozersky of the Moscow Theological
Academy, and of Professor A. S. Pavloff, of the University of Moscow; he
mentions also the latter’s article in the *Orthodox Review*, and adds
that “An Essay on a Course of Church Legislation,” by Joann Smolensk
(St. Petersburg, 1851) should be referred to.
