Antioch.</span>

<span id="xi.xv-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xi.xv-p2.1"></span>Session VII.</span>

<span id="xi.xv-p3"></span>(Labbe and Cossart, *Concilia*, Tom. IV.,
col. 618.)

<span id="xi.xv-p4"></span>The most magnificent and glorious judges
said:…The arrangement arrived at through the agreement of the most holy
Maximus, the bishop of the city of Antioch, and of the most holy
Juvenal, the bishop of Jerusalem, as the attestation of each of them
declares, shall remain firm for ever, through our decree and the
sentence of the holy synod; to wit, that the most holy bishop Maximus,
or rather the most holy church of Antioch, shall have under its own
jurisdiction the two Phœnicias and Arabia; but the most holy Juvenal,
bishop of Jerusalem, or rather the most holy Church which is under him,
shall have under his own power the three Palestines, all imperial
pragmatics and letters and penalties being done away according to the
bidding of our most sacred and pious prince.

<span id="xi.xv-p5"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xi.xv-p5.1"></span>Note.</span>

<span id="xi.xv-p6"></span>The Ballerini, in their notes to the Works of
St. Leo (Migne, *Pat. Lat*., LV., col. 733 *et seqq*.), cite fragments
of the Acts of this council, which if they can be trusted, shew that
this matter of the rights of Antioch and Jerusalem was treated of again
at a subsequent session (on Oct. 31) and determined in the same
fashion.  These fragments have generally been received as genuine, and
have been inserted by Mansi (Tom. vii., 722 C.) in his *Concilia*.

<span id="xi.xv-p7"></span>The notes of the Ballerini may also be read
with profit, in the same volume of Migne’s *Latin Patrology*, col. 737
*et seq*.
