<span id="viii.iv.iii.iv-p7"></span>Instead of <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.iv.iii.iv-p7.1"></span>ἑπιθυμῆσαι</span> we must read, with
Beveridge and Routh, who rely upon several <span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iv.iii.iv-p7.2"></span>mss.</span>, <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.iv.iii.iv-p7.3"></span>ἐπιθυμήσας</span>.  They also replace
<span class="Greek"><span id="viii.iv.iii.iv-p7.4"></span>μετ᾽</span>
<span class="Greek"><span id="viii.iv.iii.iv-p7.5"></span>αὐτῆς</span>
by <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.iv.iii.iv-p7.6"></span>αὐτῇ</span>.

<span id="viii.iv.iii.iv-p8"></span>The meaning of the canon appears to
me to be very obscure.  Hefele refers to Van Espen and adopts his view,
and Van Espen in turn has adopted Fleury’s view and given him credit for
it, referring to his *Histoire Ecclesiastique*, Lib. X., xvij.  Zonaras’
and Balsamon’s notes are almost identical, I translate that of the
latter in full.

<span id="viii.iv.iii.iv-p9"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iv.iii.iv-p9.1"></span>Balsamon.</span>

<span id="viii.iv.iii.iv-p10"></span>In sins, the Fathers say, there are
four stages, the first-motion, the struggle, the consent, and the act: 
the first two of these are not subject to punishment, but in the two
others the case is different.  For neither is the first impression nor
the struggle against it to be condemned, provided that when the reason
receives the impression it struggles with it and rejects the thought. 
But the consent thereto is subject to condemnation and accusation, and
the action to punishment.  If therefore anyone is assailed by the lust
for a woman, and is overcome so that he would perform the act with her,
he has given consent, indeed, but to the work he has not come, that is,
he has not performed the act, and it is manifest that the grace of God
has preserved him; but he shall not go off with impunity.  For the
consent alone is worthy of punishment.  And this is plain from canon
lxx. of St. Basil, which says; “A deacon polluted in lips (<span
class="Greek"><span id="viii.iv.iii.iv-p10.1"></span>ἐν χείλεσι</span>)”
or who has approached to the kiss of a woman “and confesses that he has
so sinned, is to be interdicted his ministry,” that is to say is to be
prohibited its exercise for a time.  “But he shall not be deemed
unworthy to communicate *in sacris* with the deacons.  The same is also
the case with a presbyter.  But if anyone shall go any further in sin
than this, no matter what his grade, he shall be deposed.”  Some,
however, interpret the pollution of the lips in another way; of this I
shall speak in commenting on Canon lxx. of St. Basil. <span

<span id="viii.iv.iii.iv-p11"></span> Balsamon’s note is most curious
reading, but beside being irrelevant to the present canon of Neocæsarea,
would hardly bear translation into the vernacular.
