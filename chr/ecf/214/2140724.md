id="fr_566"></span>[567](#fn_566) </span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p5"></span>Let a bishop be ordained by two or three
bishops.

<span id="xvii.iv-p6"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p6.1"></span>Canon II.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p7"></span>Let a presbyter, deacon, and the rest of
the clergy, be ordained by one bishop,

<span id="xvii.iv-p8"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p8.1"></span>Canon III.  (III. and IV.)</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p9"></span>If any bishop or presbyter offer any other
things at the altar, besides that which the Lord ordained for the
sacrifice, as honey, or milk, or strong-made drink instead of
wine, <span id="fr_567"></span>[568](#fn_567) or birds, or any living
things, or vegetables, besides that which is ordained, let him be
deposed.  Excepting only new ears of corn, and grapes at the suitable
season.  Neither is it allowed to bring anything else to the altar at
the time of the holy oblation, excepting oil for the lamps, and incense.

<span id="xvii.iv-p11"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p11.1"></span>Canon IV.  (V.)</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p12"></span>Let all other fruits be sent home as
first-fruits for the bishops and presbyters, but not offered at the
altar.  But the bishops and presbyters should of course give a share of
these things to the deacons, and the rest of the clergy.

<span id="xvii.iv-p13"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p13.1"></span>Canon V.  (VI.)</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p14"></span>Let not a bishop, presbyter, or deacon,

let him be excommunicated; and if he persists, let him be deposed.

<span id="xvii.iv-p15"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p15.1"></span>Canon VI.  (VII.)</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p16"></span>Let not a bishop, presbyter, or deacon,

<span id="xvii.iv-p17"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p17.1"></span>Canon VII.  (VIII.)</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p18"></span>If any bishop, presbyter, or deacon, shall
celebrate the holy day of Easter before the vernal equinox, with the
Jews, let him be deposed.

<span id="xvii.iv-p19"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p19.1"></span>Canon VIII (IX.)</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p20"></span>If any bishop, presbyter, or deacon, or
any one on the sacerdotal list, when the offering is made, does not
partake of it, let him declare the cause; and if it be a reasonable one,
let him be excused; but if he does not declare it, let him be
excommunicated, as being a cause of offence to the people, and
occasioning a suspicion against the offerer, as if he had not made the
offering properly.

<span id="xvii.iv-p21"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p21.1"></span>Canon IX.  (X.)</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p22"></span>All the faithful who come in and hear the
Scriptures, but do not stay for the prayers and the Holy Communion, are
to be excommunicated, as causing disorder in the Church.

<span id="xvii.iv-p23"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p23.1"></span>Canon X.  (XI.)</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p24"></span>If any one shall pray, even in a private
house, with an excommunicated person, let him also be excommunicated.

<span id="xvii.iv-p25"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p25.1"></span>Canon XI.  (XII.)</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p26"></span>If any clergyman shall join in prayer with
a deposed clergyman, as if he were a clergyman, <span
id="fr_568"></span>[569](#fn_568) let him also be deposed.

<span id="xvii.iv-p28"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p28.1"></span>Canon XII. and XIII (XIII.)</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p29"></span>If any one of the clergy or laity who is
excommunicated, or not to be received, shall go away, and be received in
another city without commendatory letters, let both the receiver and the
received be excommunicated.

<span id="xvii.iv-p30"></span>But if he be excommunicated already, let
the time of his excommunication be lengthened.

<span id="xvii.iv-p31"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p31.1"></span>Canon XIV.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p32"></span>A bishop is not to be allowed to leave his
own parish, and pass over into another, although he may be pressed by
many to do so, unless there be some proper cause constraining him, as if
he can confer some greater benefit upon the persons of that place in the
word of godliness.  And this must be done not of his own accord, but by
the judgment of many bishops, and at their earnest exhortation.

<span id="xvii.iv-p33"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p33.1"></span>Canon XV.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p34"></span>If any presbyter, or deacon, or any other
of the list of the clergy, shall leave his own parish, and go into
another, and having entirely forsaken his own, shall make his abode in
the other parish without the permission of his own bishop, we ordain
that he shall no longer perform divine service; more especially if his
own bishop having exhorted him to return he has refused to do so, and
persists in his disorderly conduct.  But let him communicate there as a
layman.

<span id="xvii.iv-p35"></span><span id="page_595">p. 595</span> <span
id="xvii.iv-Page_595"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p35.1"></span>Canon XVI.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p36"></span>If, however, the bishop, with whom any
such persons are staying, shall disregard the command that they are to
cease from performing divine offices, and shall receive them as
clergymen, let him be excommunicated, as a teacher of disorder.

<span id="xvii.iv-p37"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p37.1"></span>Canon XVII.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p38"></span>He who has been twice married after
baptism, or who has had a concubine, cannot become a bishop, presbyter,
or deacon, or any other of the sacerdotal list.

<span id="xvii.iv-p39"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p39.1"></span>Canon XVIII.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p40"></span>He who married a widow, or a divorced
woman, or an harlot, or a servant-maid, or an actress, cannot be a
bishop, presbyter, or deacon, or any other of the sacerdotal list.

<span id="xvii.iv-p41"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p41.1"></span>Canon XIX.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p42"></span>He who has married two sisters, or a
niece, cannot become a clergyman.

<span id="xvii.iv-p43"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p43.1"></span>Canon XX.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p44"></span>If a clergyman becomes surety for any one,
let him be deposed.

<span id="xvii.iv-p45"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p45.1"></span>Canon XXI.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p46"></span>An eunuch, if he has been made so by the
violence of men or \[if his *virilia* have been amputated <span
id="fr_569"></span>[570](#fn_569) \] in times of persecution, or if he
has been born so, if in other respects he is worthy, may be made a
bishop.

<span id="xvii.iv-p48"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p48.1"></span>Canon XXII.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p49"></span>He who has mutilated himself, cannot
become a clergyman, for he is a self-murderer, and an enemy to the
workmanship of God.

<span id="xvii.iv-p50"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p50.1"></span>Canon XXIII.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p51"></span>If any man being a clergyman shall
mutilate himself, let him be deposed, for he is a self-murderer.

<span id="xvii.iv-p52"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p52.1"></span>Canon XXIV.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p53"></span>If a layman mutilate himself, let him be
excommunicated for three years, as practising against his own life.

<span id="xvii.iv-p54"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p54.1"></span>Canon XXV.  (XXV. and XXVI.)</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p55"></span>If a bishop, presbyter, or deacon be found
guilty of fornication, perjury, or theft, let him be deposed, but let
him not be excommunicated; for the Scripture says, “thou shalt not
punish a man twice for the same offence.”  In like manner the other
clergy shall be subject to the same proceeding. <span
id="fr_570"></span>[571](#fn_570)

<span id="xvii.iv-p57"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p57.1"></span>Canon XXVI.  (XXVII.)</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p58"></span>Of those who have been admitted to the
clergy unmarried, we ordain, that the readers and singers only may, if
they will, marry.

<span id="xvii.iv-p59"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p59.1"></span>Canon XXVII.  (XXVIII.)</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p60"></span>If a bishop, presbyter, or deacon shall
strike any of the faithful who have sinned, or of the unbelievers who
have done wrong, with the intention of frightening them, we command that
he be deposed.  For our Lord has by no means taught us to do so, but, on
the contrary, when he was smitten he smote not again, when he was
reviled he reviled not again, when he suffered he threatened not.

<span id="xvii.iv-p61"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p61.1"></span>Canon XXVIII.  (XXIX.)</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p62"></span>If any bishop, presbyter, or deacon,
having been justly deposed upon open accusations, shall dare to meddle
with any of the divine offices which had been intrusted to him, let him
be altogether cut off from the Church.

<span id="xvii.iv-p63"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p63.1"></span>Canon XXIX.  (XXX.)</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p64"></span>If any bishop, presbyter, or deacon, shall
obtain possession of that dignity by money, let both him and the person
who ordained him be deposed, and also altogether cut off from all
communion, as Simon Magus was by me Peter.

<span id="xvii.iv-p65"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p65.1"></span>Canon XXX.  (XXXI.)</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p66"></span>If any bishop obtain possession of a
church by the aid of the temporal powers, let him be deposed and
excommunicated, and all who communicate with him.

<span id="xvii.iv-p67"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p67.1"></span>Canon XXXI.  (XXXII.)</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p68"></span>If any presbyter, despising his own
bishop, shall collect a separate congregation, and erect another altar,
not having any grounds for condemning the bishop with regard to religion
or justice, let him be deposed for his ambition; for he is a tyrant; in
like manner also the rest of the clergy, and as many as join him; and
let laymen be excommunicated.  Let this, however, be done after a first,
second, and third admonition from the bishop.

<span id="xvii.iv-p69"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p69.1"></span>Canon XXXII.  (XXXIII.)</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p70"></span>If any presbyter or deacon has been
excommunicated by a bishop, he may not be received <span
id="page_596">p. 596</span> <span id="xvii.iv-Page_596"></span>into
communion again by any other than by him who excommunicated him, unless
it happen that the bishop who excommunicated him be dead.

<span id="xvii.iv-p71"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p71.1"></span>Canon XXXIII.  (XXXIV.)</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p72"></span>No foreign bishop, presbyter, or deacon,
may be received without commendatory letters; and when they are produced
let the persons be examined; and if they be preachers of godliness, let
them be received.  Otherwise, although you supply them with what they
need, you must not receive them into communion, for many things are done
surreptitiously.

<span id="xvii.iv-p73"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p73.1"></span>Canon XXXIV.  (XXXV.)</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p74"></span>The bishops of every nation must
acknowledge him who is first among them and account him as their head,
and do nothing of consequence without his consent; but each may do those
things only which concern his own parish, and the country places which
belong to it.  But neither let him (who is the first) do anything
without the consent of all; for so there will be unanimity, and God will
be glorified through the Lord in the Holy Spirit. <span
id="fr_571"></span>[572](#fn_571)

<span id="xvii.iv-p76"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p76.1"></span>Canon XXXV.  (XXXVI.)</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p77"></span>Let not a bishop dare to ordain beyond his
own limits, in cities and places not subject to him.  But if he be
convicted of doing so, without the consent of those persons who have
authority over such cities and places, let him be deposed, and those
also whom he has ordained.

<span id="xvii.iv-p78"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p78.1"></span>Canon XXXVI.  (XXXVII.)</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p79"></span>If any person, having been ordained
bishop, does not undertake the ministry, and the care of the people
committed to him, let him be excommunicated until he does undertake it. 
In like manner a presbyter or deacon.  But if he has gone and has not
been received, not of his own will but from the perverseness of the
people, let him continue bishop; and let the clergy of the city be
excommunicated, because they have not corrected the disobedient people.

<span id="xvii.iv-p80"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p80.1"></span>Canon XXXVII.  (XXXVIII.)</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p81"></span>Let there be a meeting of the bishops
twice a year, and let them examine amongst themselves the decrees
concerning religion and settle the ecclesiastical controversies which
may have occurred.  One meeting to be held in the fourth week of
Pentecost \[i.e., the fourth week after Easter\], and the other on the
12th day of the month Hyperberetæus \[i.e., October\].

<span id="xvii.iv-p82"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p82.1"></span>Canon XXXVIII.  (XXXIX.)</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p83"></span>Let the bishop have the care of all the
goods of the Church, and let him administer them as under the inspection
of God.  But he must not alienate any of them or give the things which
belong to God to his own relations.  If they be poor let him relieve
them as poor; but let him not, under that pretence, sell the goods of
the Church.

<span id="xvii.iv-p84"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p84.1"></span>Canon XXXIX.  (XL.)</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p85"></span>Let not the presbyters or deacons do
anything without the sanction of the bishop; for he it is who is
intrusted with the people of the Lord, and of whom will be required the
account of their souls.

<span id="xvii.iv-p86"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p86.1"></span>Canon XL.  (XL. Continued.)</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p87"></span>Let the private goods of the bishop, if he
have any such, and those of the Lord, be clearly distinguished, that the
bishop may have the power of leaving his own goods, when he dies, to
whom he will, and how he will, and that the bishop’s own property may
not be lost under pretence of its being the property of the Church:  for
it may be that he has a wife, or children, or relations, or servants;
and it is just before God and man, that neither should the Church suffer
any loss through ignorance of the bishop’s own property, nor the bishop
or his relations be injured under pretext of the Church:  nor that those
who belong to him should be involved in contests, and cast reproaches
upon his death.

<span id="xvii.iv-p88"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p88.1"></span>Canon XLI.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p89"></span>We ordain that the bishop have authority
over the goods of the Church:  for if he is to be intrusted with the
precious souls of men, much more are temporal possessions to be
intrusted to him.  He is therefore to administer them all of his own
authority, and supply those who need, through the presbyters and
deacons, in the fear of God, and with all reverence.  He may also, if
need be, take what is required for his own necessary wants, and for the
brethren to whom he has to show hospitality, so that he may not be in
any want.  For the law of God has ordained, that they who wait at the
altar should be nour<span id="page_597">p. 597</span> <span
id="xvii.iv-Page_597"></span>ished of the altar.  Neither does any
soldier bear arms against an enemy at his own cost.

<span id="xvii.iv-p90"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p90.1"></span>Canon XLII.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p91"></span>If a bishop or presbyter, or deacon, is
addicted to dice or drinking, let him either give it over, or be
deposed.

<span id="xvii.iv-p92"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p92.1"></span>Canon XLIII.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p93"></span>If a subdeacon, reader, or singer, commits
the same things, let him either give over, or be excommunicated.  So
also laymen.

<span id="xvii.iv-p94"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p94.1"></span>Canon XLIV.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p95"></span>Let a bishop, presbyter, or deacon, who
takes usury from those who borrow of him, give up doing so, or be
deposed.

<span id="xvii.iv-p96"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p96.1"></span>Canon XLV.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p97"></span>Let a bishop, presbyter, or deacon, who
has only prayed with heretics, be excommunicated:  but if he has
permitted them to perform any clerical office, let him be deposed.

<span id="xvii.iv-p98"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p98.1"></span>Canon XLVI.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p99"></span>We ordain that a bishop, or presbyter, who
has admitted the baptism or sacrifice of heretics, be deposed.  For what
concord hath Christ with Belial, or what part hath a believer with an
infidel?

<span id="xvii.iv-p100"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p100.1"></span>Canon XLVII.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p101"></span>Let a bishop or presbyter who shall
baptize again one who has rightly received baptism, or who shall not
baptize one who has been polluted by the ungodly, be deposed, as
despising the cross and death of the Lord, and not making a distinction
between the true priests and the false.

<span id="xvii.iv-p102"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p102.1"></span>Canon XLVIII.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p103"></span>If any layman put away his wife and marry
another, or one who has been divorced by another man, let him be
excommunicated.

<span id="xvii.iv-p104"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p104.1"></span>Canon XLIX.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p105"></span>If any bishop or presbyter, contrary to
the ordinance of the Lord, does not baptize into the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Ghost, but into three Unoriginated Beings, or three Sons,
or three Comforters, let him be deposed.

<span id="xvii.iv-p106"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p106.1"></span>Canon L.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p107"></span>If any bishop or presbyter does not
perform the one initiation with three immersions, but with giving one
immersion only, into the death of the Lord, let him be deposed.  For the
Lord said not, Baptize into my death, but, “Go, make disciples of all
nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and
of the Holy Ghost.”

<span id="xvii.iv-p108"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p108.1"></span>Canon LI.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p109"></span>If any bishop, presbyter, or deacon, or
any one of the sacerdotal list, abstains from marriage, or flesh, or
wine, not by way of religious restraint, but as abhorring them,
forgetting that God made all things very good, and that he made man male
and female, and blaspheming the work of creation, let him be corrected,
or else be deposed, and cast out of the Church.  In like manner a
layman.

<span id="xvii.iv-p110"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p110.1"></span>Canon LII.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p111"></span>If any bishop or presbyter, <span
id="fr_572"></span>[573](#fn_572) does not receive him who turns away
from his sin, but rejects him, let him be deposed; for he grieveth
Christ who said, “There is joy in heaven over one sinner that
repenteth.”

<span id="xvii.iv-p113"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p113.1"></span>Canon LIII.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p114"></span>If any bishop, presbyter, or deacon, does
not on festival days partake of flesh and wine, from an abhorrence of
them, and not out of religious restraint, let him be deposed, as being
seared in his own conscience, and being the cause of offence to many.

<span id="xvii.iv-p115"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p115.1"></span>Canon LIV.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p116"></span>If any of the clergy be found eating in a
tavern, let him be excommunicated, unless he has been constrained by
necessity, on a journey, to lodge in an inn.

<span id="xvii.iv-p117"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p117.1"></span>Canon LV.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p118"></span>If any of the clergy insult the bishop,
let him be deposed:  for “thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy
people.”

<span id="xvii.iv-p119"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p119.1"></span>Canon LVI.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p120"></span>If any of the clergy insult a presbyter,
or deacon, let him be excommunicated.

<span id="xvii.iv-p121"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p121.1"></span>Canon LVII.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p122"></span>If any of the clergy mock the lame, or
the deaf, or the blind, or him who is infirm in his legs, let him be
excommunicated.  In like manner any of the laity.

<span id="xvii.iv-p123"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p123.1"></span>Canon LVIII.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p124"></span>If any bishop or presbyter neglects the
clergy or the people, and does not instruct them in the way of
godliness, let him be ex<span id="page_598">p. 598</span> <span
id="xvii.iv-Page_598"></span>communicated, and if he persists in his
negligence and idleness, let him be deposed.

<span id="xvii.iv-p125"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p125.1"></span>Canon LIX.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p126"></span>If any bishop, presbyter, or deacon, when
any of the clergy is in want, does not supply him with what he needs,
let him be excommunicated; but if he persists, let him be deposed, as
one who has killed his brother.

<span id="xvii.iv-p127"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p127.1"></span>Canon LX.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p128"></span>If any one reads publicly in the church
the falsely inscribed <span id="fr_573"></span>[574](#fn_573) books of
impious men, as if they were holy Scripture, to the destruction of the
people and clergy, let him be deposed.

<span id="xvii.iv-p130"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p130.1"></span>Canon LXI.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p131"></span>If any accusation be brought against a
believer of fornication or adultery, or any forbidden action, and he be
convicted, let him not be promoted to the clergy.

<span id="xvii.iv-p132"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p132.1"></span>Canon LXII.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p133"></span>If any of the clergy, through fear of
men, whether Jew, heathen, or heretic, shall deny the name of Christ,
let him be cast out.  If he deny the name of a clergyman, let him be
deposed.  If he repent, let him be received as a layman.

id="xvii.iv-p134.1"></span>Canon LXIII.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p135"></span>If any bishop, presbyter, or deacon, or
any one of the sacerdotal order, shall eat flesh, with the blood of the
life thereof, or anything killed by beasts, or that dies of itself, let
him be deposed.  For the law has forbidden this.  If he be a layman, let
him be excommunicated.

<span id="xvii.iv-p136"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p136.1"></span>Canon LXIV.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p137"></span>If any clergyman or layman shall enter
into a synagogue of Jews or heretics to pray, let the former be deposed
and let the latter be excommunicated. <span

<span id="xvii.iv-p139"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p139.1"></span>Canon LXV.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p140"></span>If any clergyman shall strike anyone in a
contest, and kill him with one blow, let him be deposed for his
violence.  If a layman do so, let him be excommunicated.

id="xvii.iv-p141.1"></span>Canon LXVI.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p142"></span>If any of the clergy be found fasting on
the Lord’s day, or on the Sabbath, <span
id="fr_575"></span>[576](#fn_575) excepting the one only, let him be
deposed.  If a layman, let him be excommunicated.

<span id="xvii.iv-p144"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p144.1"></span>Canon LXVII.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p145"></span>If anyone shall force and keep a virgin
not espoused, let him be excommunicated.  And he may not take any other,
but must retain her whom he has chosen, though she be a poor person.

<span id="xvii.iv-p146"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p146.1"></span>Canon LXVIII.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p147"></span>If any bishop, presbyter, or deacon,
shall receive from anyone a second ordination, let both the ordained and
the ordainer be deposed; unless indeed it be proved that he had his
ordination from heretics; for those who have been baptized or ordained
by such persons cannot be either of the faithful or of the clergy.

<span id="xvii.iv-p148"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p148.1"></span>Canon LXIX.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p149"></span>If any bishop, presbyter, or deacon, or
reader, or singer, does not fast the holy Quadragesimal fast of Easter,
or the fourth day, or the day of Preparation, let him be deposed, unless
he be hindered by some bodily infirmity.  If he be a layman, let him be
excommunicated.

<span id="xvii.iv-p150"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p150.1"></span>Canon LXX.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p151"></span>If any bishop, presbyter, or deacon, or
any one of the list of clergy, keeps fast or festival with the Jews, or
receives from them any of the gifts of their feasts, as unleavened
bread, any such things, let him be deposed.  If he be a layman, let him
be excommunicated.

<span id="xvii.iv-p152"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p152.1"></span>Canon LXXI.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p153"></span>If any Christian brings oil into a temple
of the heathen or into a synagogue of the Jews at their feast, or lights
lamps, let him be excommunicated.

<span id="xvii.iv-p154"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p154.1"></span>Canon LXXII.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p155"></span>If any clergyman or layman takes away wax
or oil from the holy Church, let him be excommunicated, \[and let him
restore a fifth part more than he took.\] <span
id="fr_576"></span>[577](#fn_576)

<span id="xvii.iv-p157"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p157.1"></span>Canon LXXIII.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p158"></span>Let no one convert to his own use any
vessel of gold or silver, or any veil which has been sanctified, for it
is contrary to law; and if anyone be detected doing so, let him be
excommunicated.

<span id="xvii.iv-p159"></span><span id="page_599">p. 599</span> <span
id="xvii.iv-Page_599"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p159.1"></span>Canon LXXIV.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p160"></span>If any bishop has been accused of
anything by men worthy of credit, he must be summoned by the bishops;
and if he appears, and confesses, or is convicted, a suitable punishment
must be inflicted upon him.  But if when he is summoned he does not
attend, let him be summoned a second time, two bishops being sent to
him, for that purpose.  \[If even then he will not attend, let him be
summoned a third time, two bishops being again sent to him. <span
id="fr_577"></span>[578](#fn_577) \]  But if even then he shall
disregard the summons and not come, let the synod pronounce such
sentence against him as appears right, that he may not seem to profit by
avoiding judgment.

<span id="xvii.iv-p162"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p162.1"></span>Canon LXXV.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p163"></span>An heretic is not to be received as
witness against a bishop, neither only one believer; for “in the mouth
of two or three witnesses, every word shall be established.”

<span id="xvii.iv-p164"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p164.1"></span>Canon LXXVI.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p165"></span>A bishop must not out of favour to a
brother or a son, or any other relation, ordain whom he will to the
episcopal dignity; for it is not right to make heirs of the bishopric,
giving the things of God to human affections.  Neither is it fitting to
subject the Church of God to heirs.  But if anyone shall do so let the
ordination be void, and the ordainer himself be punished with
excommunication.

<span id="xvii.iv-p166"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p166.1"></span>Canon LXXVII.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p167"></span>If any one be deprived of an eye, or lame
of a leg, but in other respects be worthy of a bishopric, he may be
ordained, for the defect of the body does not defile a man, but the
pollution of the soul.

<span id="xvii.iv-p168"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p168.1"></span>Canon LXXVIII.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p169"></span>But if a man be deaf or blind, he may not
be made a bishop, not indeed as if he were thus defiled, but that the
affairs of the Church may not be hindered.

<span id="xvii.iv-p170"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p170.1"></span>Canon LXXIX.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p171"></span>If anyone has a devil, let him not be
made a clergyman, neither let him pray with the faithful; but if he be
freed, let him be received into communion, and if he is worthy he may be
ordained.

<span id="xvii.iv-p172"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p172.1"></span>Canon LXXX.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p173"></span>It is not allowed that a man who has come
over from an heathen life, and been baptized or who has been converted
from an evil course of living, should be immediately made a bishop, for
it is not right that he who has not been tried himself should be a
teacher of others.  Unless indeed this be done upon a special
manifestation of Divine grace in his favour.

<span id="xvii.iv-p174"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p174.1"></span>Canon LXXXI.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p175"></span>We have said that a bishop or presbyter
must not give himself to the management of public affairs, but devote
himself to ecclesiastical business.  Let him then be persuaded to do so,
or let him be deposed, for no man can serve two masters, according to
the Lord’s declaration.

<span id="xvii.iv-p176"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p176.1"></span>Canon LXXXII.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p177"></span>We do not allow any servants to be
promoted to the clergy without the consent of their masters, \[to the
troubling of their houses. <span id="fr_578"></span>[579](#fn_578) \] 
But if any servant should appear worthy of receiving an order, <span
id="fr_579"></span>[580](#fn_579) as our Onesimus appeared, and his
masters agree and liberate him, and send him out of their house, he may
be ordained.

<span id="xvii.iv-p180"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p180.1"></span>Canon LXXXIII.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p181"></span>If a bishop, presbyter, or deacon, shall
serve in the army, and wish to retain both the Roman magistracy and the
priestly office, let him be deposed; for the things of Cæsar belong to
Cæsar, and those of God to God.

<span id="xvii.iv-p182"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p182.1"></span>Canon LXXXIV.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p183"></span>Whosoever shall insult the King, or a
ruler, contrary to what is right, let him suffer punishment.  If he be a
clergyman, let him be deposed; if a layman, excommunicated.

<span id="xvii.iv-p184"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.iv-p184.1"></span>Canon LXXXV.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p185"></span>Let the following books be counted
venerable and sacred by all of you, both clergy and Laity.  Of the Old
Testament, five books of Moses, Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers,
Deuteronomy; of Joshua the Son of Nun, one; of the Judges, one; of Ruth,
one; of the Kings, four; of the Chronicles of the book of the days, two;
of Ezra, two; of Esther, one; \[some texts read “of Judith, one”;\] of
the Maccabees, three; of Job, one; of the Psalter, one; of Solomon,
three, viz.:  Pro<span id="page_600">p. 600</span> <span
id="xvii.iv-Page_600"></span>verbs, Ecclesiastes, and the Song of Songs;
of the Prophets, twelve; of Isaiah, one; of Jeremiah, one; of Ezekiel,
one; of Daniel, one.  But besides these you are recommended to teach
your young persons the Wisdom of the very learned Sirach.  Our own
books, that is, those of the New Testament, are:  the four Gospels of
Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John; fourteen Epistles of Paul; two Epistles
of Peter; three of John; one of James, and one of Jude.  Two Epistles of
Clemens, and the Constitutions of me Clemens, addressed to you Bishops,
in eight books, which are not to be published to all on account of the
mystical things in them.  And the Acts of us the Apostles. <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_565"></span>[594:566](2140724.htm#fr_565) <span
id="xvii.iv-p1.2"></span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p2"></span> The Latin caption is “The Ecclesiastical
Rules of the Holy Apostles, set forth by Clement, Pontiff of the Roman
Church.”

<span id="fn_566"></span>[594:567](2140724.htm#fr_566) <span
id="xvii.iv-p3.2"></span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p4"></span> The numbering which I have followed is
Hammond’s, but, where it differs from that given by Hefele, I have
placed Hefele’s numbering in parenthesis.  With Hefele agree Van Espen
and Bruns (in his alternative numbering) and Johnson’s marginal
numbering.  The numbering that Johnson himself follows is that of
Cotelerius.

<span id="fn_567"></span>[594:568](2140724.htm#fr_567) <span
id="xvii.iv-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p10"></span> The text here varies.

<span id="fn_568"></span>[594:569](2140724.htm#fr_568) <span
id="xvii.iv-p26.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p27"></span> Hammond seems to have omitted <span
class="Greek"><span id="xvii.iv-p27.1"></span>ὡς κληρικῷ</span>, which I
have supplied.

<span id="fn_569"></span>[595:570](2140724.htm#fr_569) <span
id="xvii.iv-p46.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p47"></span> Hammond has omitted these words.

<span id="fn_570"></span>[595:571](2140724.htm#fr_570) <span
id="xvii.iv-p55.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p56"></span> I have changed Hammond’s rendering of
this last phrase, “in like manner with respect to the other clergy.”

<span id="fn_571"></span>[596:572](2140724.htm#fr_571) <span
id="xvii.iv-p74.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p75"></span> The text here differs; I follow
Beveridge.  Hammond reads, “Through the Lord Jesus Christ, and the
Father through the Lord by the Holy Spirit, even the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Spirit.”

<span id="fn_572"></span>[597:573](2140724.htm#fr_572) <span
id="xvii.iv-p111.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p112"></span> Hammond adds “or deacon.”

<span id="fn_573"></span>[598:574](2140724.htm#fr_573) <span
id="xvii.iv-p128.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p129"></span> Hammond translates “bearing false
inscriptions,” the Greek is <span class="Greek"><span
id="xvii.iv-p129.1"></span>ψευδεπίγραφα</span>.

<span id="fn_574"></span>[598:575](2140724.htm#fr_574) <span
id="xvii.iv-p137.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p138"></span> Hammond translates differently with the
same meaning.

<span id="fn_575"></span>[598:576](2140724.htm#fr_575) <span
id="xvii.iv-p142.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p143"></span> Hammond substitutes “any Saturday,” and
omits the word “only.”

<span id="fn_576"></span>[598:577](2140724.htm#fr_576) <span
id="xvii.iv-p155.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p156"></span> This last phrase is omitted by Hammond,
but is found in the Latin and in some of the Greek texts.

<span id="fn_577"></span>[599:578](2140724.htm#fr_577) <span
id="xvii.iv-p160.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p161"></span> According to Hefele, these words are
only in the Latin, but they are in the Greek text of Beveridge.

<span id="fn_578"></span>[599:579](2140724.htm#fr_578) <span
id="xvii.iv-p177.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p178"></span> According to Hefele this is only in the
Latin, but it is found in the Greek of Beveridge.

<span id="fn_579"></span>[599:580](2140724.htm#fr_579) <span
id="xvii.iv-p178.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p179"></span> I have changed Hammond’s translation
here.

<span id="fn_580"></span>[600:581](2140724.htm#fr_580) <span
id="xvii.iv-p185.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p186"></span> The text of this canon is quite
different in the different codices and versions.  I have departed from
Hammond’s version.
