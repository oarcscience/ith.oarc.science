<span id="xv.iv.iv.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xi-p1.1"></span>Canon X.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xi-p2"></span>Of presbyters who are corrected by
their own bishops.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xi-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xi-p3.1"></span>Alypius</span> the bishop, a legate of the
province of Numidia, said:  Nor should this be passed over; if by chance
any presbyter when corrected by his bishop, inflamed by self-conceit or
pride, has thought fit to offer sacrifices to God separately \[from the
authority of the bishop\] or has believed it right to erect another
altar, contrary to ecclesiastical faith and discipline, such should not
get off with impunity.  Valentine, of the primatial see of the province
of Numidia, said:  The propositions made by our brother Alypius are of
necessity congruous to ecclesiastical discipline and faith; therefore
enact what seems good to your belovedness.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xi-p5"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xi-p5.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon X.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xi-p6"></span>If one condemned by his bishop shall
separate himself and set up an altar or make the offering he should be
punished.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xi-p7"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xi-p7.1"></span>Aristenus.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xi-p8"></span>Whoever has been cut off by his own
bishop and does not go to the synod to which his bishop is subject, that
an examination may be made of the grounds of his cutting off, and that
whatever is contrary to justice may be corrected; but, puffed up with
pride and conceit, shall despise the synod and separate himself from the
Church, and shall set up another altar, and shall offer to God the holy
gifts; such an one shall not be allowed to go on with impunity, since he
is acting contrary to the faith and constitution of the Church; but he
is to be stricken with anathema.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xi-p9"></span>This and the following canon are Canon
viii. of the so often mentioned synod of 387 or 390.
