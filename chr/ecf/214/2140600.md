<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.lxxvii-p1.1"></span>Canon LXXVI.  (Greek lxxix.)</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxxvii-p2"></span>Of bishops who do not put in an
appearance at Council.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxxvii-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.lxxvii-p3.1"></span>Item</span>, it seemed good that as
often as the council is to be assembled, the bishops who are impeded
neither by age, sickness, or other grave necessity, come together, and
that notice be given to the primates of their several provinces, that
from all the bishops there be made two or three squads, and of each of
these squads there be elected some who shall be promptly ready on the
council day:  but should they not be able to attend, <span
id="page_480">p. 480</span> <span
id="xv.iv.iv.lxxvii-Page_480"></span>let them write their excuses in the
tractory, <span id="fr_464"></span>[465](#fn_464) or if after the coming
of the tractory certain necessities suddenly arise by chance, unless
they send to their own primate an account of their impediment, they
ought to be content with the communion of their own Church.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxxvii-p7"></span>Those who do not attend the annual
synod, unless they be involuntarily prevented, must be satisfied with
the communion of their own churches.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxxvii-p8"></span>This is Canon xj., of Carthage,
September, 401.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxxvii-p10"></span>“Tractory” has several
significations; here it seems to denote the written return made by the
Primate of the province to the synodical letter sent by the Bishop of
Carthage.  In the acts inserted between canon 90th and 91st “Tractoria”
seems to denote the letter of the Primate to the inferior bishops for
choosing legates, if it do not rather denote the Bishop of Carthage’s
circular-letter to all the primates, as it does in the next paragraph.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxxvii-p11"></span>\[The penalty in the last clause
is\] a very singular sort of censure, and very moderate.  See Can. 80
(83).
