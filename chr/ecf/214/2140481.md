<span id="xiv.iii.xcviii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.xcviii-p2.1"></span>Those</span> who have commerce with a
wife or in any other manner without regard thereto make sacred places
common, and treat them with contempt and thus remain in them, we order
all such to be expelled, even from the dwellings of the catechumens
which are in the venerable temples.  And if any one shall not observe
these directions, if he be a cleric let him be deposed, but if a layman
let him be cut off.

<span id="xiv.iii.xcviii-p5"></span>Whoever in a temple has commerce
with his wife and remains there out of contempt, shall be expelled even
from the Catechumens.  If any one shall not observe this he shall be
deposed or cut off.

<span id="xiv.iii.xcviii-p7"></span>In the name of holy places, not the
church itself but the adjoining and dependent buildings are intended
such as those which are called the “Catechumena.”  For no one would be
audacious enough to wish to cohabit with his wife in the very temple
itself.
