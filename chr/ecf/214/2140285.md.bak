<span id="x.xvi.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="x.xvi.iii-p1.1"></span>Excursus on the Conciliabulum of John of
Antioch.</span>

<span id="x.xvi.iii-p2"></span>The assembly referred to in this canon is
one held by John of Antioch who had delayed his coming so as to hamper
the meeting of the synod.  John was a friend of Nestorius and made many
fruitless attempts to induce him to accept the orthodox faith.  It will
be noticed that the conciliabulum was absolutely silent with respect to
Nestorius and his doctrine and contented itself with attacking St. Cyril
and the orthodox Memnon, the bishop of Ephesus.  St. Cyril and his
friends did indeed accuse the Antiochenes of being adherents of
Nestorius, and in a negative way they certainly were so, and were in
open opposition to the defenders of the orthodox faith; but, as
Tillemont <span id="fr_262"></span>[263](#fn_262.md) has well pointed out,
they did not theologically agree with the heresy of Nestorius, gladly
accepted the orthodox watchword “Mother of God,” and subsequently agreed
to his deposition.

<span id="x.xvi.iii-p4"></span>The first session of the Council of
Ephesus had already taken place on June 22, and it was only on June 26th
or 27th, that John of Antioch arrived at last at Ephesus.

<span id="x.xvi.iii-p5"></span>(Hefele, *History of the Councils*, Vol.
III., p. 55 *et seqq*.)

<span id="x.xvi.iii-p6"></span>The Synod immediately sent a deputation
to meet him, consisting of several bishops and clerics, to show him
proper respect, and at the same time to make him acquainted with the
deposition of Nestorius, so that he might not be drawn into any
intercourse with him.  The soldiers who surrounded Archbishop John
prevented the deputation from speaking to him in the street;
consequently they accompanied him to his abode, but were compelled to
wait here for several hours, exposed to the insults of the soldiers, and
at last, when they had discharged their commission, were driven home,
ill-treated and beaten.  Count Irenæus, the friend of Nestorius, had
suggested this treatment, and approved of it.  The envoys immediately
informed the Synod of what had happened, and showed the wounds which
they had received, which called forth great indignation against John of
Antioch.  According to the representation of Memnon, excommunication was
for this reason pronounced against him; but we shall see further on that
this did not take place until afterwards, and it is clear that Memnon,
in his brief narrative, has passed over an intermediate portion—the
threefold invitation of John.  In the meantime, Candidian had gone still
further in his opposition to the members of the synod, causing them to
be annoyed and insulted by his soldiers, and even cutting off their
supply of food, while he provided Nestorius with a regular body-guard of
armed peasants.  John of Antioch, immediately after his arrival, while
still dusty from the journey, and at the time when he was allowing the
envoys of the synod to wait, held at his town residence a Conciliabulum
with his adherents, at which, first of all Count Candidian related how
Cyril and his friends, in spite of all warnings, and in opposition to
the imperial decrees, had held a session five days before, had contested
his (the count’s) right to be present, had dismissed the bishops sent by
Nestorius, and had paid no attention to the letters of <span
id="page_227">p. 227</span> <span
id="x.xvi.iii-Page_227"></span>others.  Before he proceeded further,
John of Antioch requested that the Emperor’s edict of convocation should
be read, whereupon Candidian went on with his account of what had taken
place, and in answer to a fresh question of John’s declared that
Nestorius had been condemned unheard.  John found this quite in keeping
with the disposition of the synod since, instead of receiving him and
his companions in a friendly manner, they had rushed upon them
tumultuously (it was thus that he described what had happened).  *But
the holy Synod, which was now assembled*, would decide what was proper
with respect to them.  And this synod, of which John speaks in such
grandiloquent terms, numbered only forty-three members, including
himself, while on the other side there were more than two hundred.

<span id="x.xvi.iii-p7"></span>John then proposed the question \[as to\]
what was to be decided respecting Cyril and his adherents; and several
who were not particularly pronounced Nestorian bishops came forward to
relate how Cyril and Memnon of Ephesus had, from the beginning,
maltreated the Nestorians, had allowed them no church, and even on the
festival of Pentecost had permitted them to hold no service.  Besides
Memnon had sent his clerics into the residences of the bishops, and had
ordered them with threats to take part in his council.  And in this way
he and Cyril had confused everything, so that their own heresies might
not be examined.  Heresies, such as the Arian, the Apollinarian, and the
Eunomian, were certainly contained in the last letter of Cyril \[to
Nestorius, along with the anathematisms\].  It was therefore John’s duty
to see to it that the heads of these heresies (Cyril and Memnon) should
be suitably punished for such grave offences, and that the bishops who
had been misguided by them should be subjected to ecclesiastical
penalties.

<span id="x.xvi.iii-p8"></span>To these impudent and false accusations
John replied with hypocritical meekness “that he had certainly wished
that he should not be compelled to exclude from the Church any one who
had been received into the sacred priesthood, but diseased members must
certainly be cut off in order to save the whole body; and for this
reason Cyril and Memnon deserved to be deposed, because they had given
occasion to disorders, and had acted in opposition to the commands of
the Emperors, and besides, were in the chapters mentioned \[the
anathematisms\] guilty of heresy.  All who had been misled by them were
to be excommunicated until they confessed their error, anathematized the
heretical propositions of Cyril, adhered strictly to the creed of Nice,
without any foreign addition, and joined the synod of John.”

<span id="x.xvi.iii-p9"></span>The assembly approved of this proposal,
and John then announced the sentence in the following manner:—

<span id="x.xvi.iii-p10"></span>“The holy Synod, assembled in Ephesus,
by the grace of God and the command of the pious Emperors, declares:  We
should indeed have wished to be able to hold a Synod in peace, but
because you held a separate assembly from a heretical, insolent, and
obstinate disposition, although we were already in the neighbourhood,
and have filled both the city and the holy Synod with confusion, in
order to prevent the examination of your Apollinarian, Arian, and
Eunomian heresies, and have not waited for the arrival of the holy
bishops of all regions, and have also disregarded the warnings and
admonitions of Candidian, therefore shall you, Cyril of Alexandria, and
you Memnon of this place, know that you are deposed and dismissed from
all sacerdotal functions, as the originators of the whole disorder,
etc.  You others, who gave your consent, are excommunicated, until you
acknowledge your fault and reform, accept anew the Nicene faith \[as if
they had surrendered it!\] without foreign addition, anathematize the
heretical propositions of Cyril, and in all things comply with the
command of the Emperors, who require a peaceful and more accurate
consideration of the dogma.”

<span id="x.xvi.iii-p11"></span>This decree was subscribed by all the
forty-three members of the Conciliabulum:

<span id="x.xvi.iii-p12"></span>The Conciliabulum then, in very
one-sided letters informed the Emperor, the imperial <span
id="page_228">p. 228</span> <span id="x.xvi.iii-Page_228"></span>ladies
(the wife and sister of the Emperor Theodosius II.), the clergy, the
senate, and the people of Constantinople, of all that had taken place,
and a little later once more required the members of the genuine Synod,
in writing, no longer to delay the time for repentance and conversion,
and to separate themselves from Cyril and Memnon, etc., otherwise they
would very soon be forced to lament their own folly.

<span id="x.xvi.iii-p13"></span>On Saturday evening the Conciliabulum
asked Count Candidian to take care that neither Cyril nor Memnon, nor
any one of their (excommunicated) adherents should hold divine service
on Sunday.  Candidian now wished that no member of either synodal party
should officiate, but only the ordinary clergy of the city; but Memnon
declared that he would in no way submit to John and his synod, and Cyril
and his adherents held divine service.  All the efforts of John to
appoint by force another bishop of Ephesus in the place of Memnon were
frustrated by the opposition of the orthodox inhabitants.
