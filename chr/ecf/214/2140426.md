<span id="xiv.iii.xliii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.xliii-p2.1"></span>Those</span> who are called Eremites and
are clothed in black robes, and with long hair go about cities and
associate with the worldly both men and women and bring odium upon their
profession—we decree that if they will receive the habit of other monks
and wear their hair cut short, they may be shut up in a monastery and
numbered among the brothers; but if they do not choose to do this, they
are to be expelled from the cities and forced to live in the desert
(<span class="Greek"><span
id="xiv.iii.xliii-p2.2"></span>ἐρήμους</span>) from whence also they
derive their name.

<span id="xiv.iii.xliii-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.xliii-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XLII.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.xliii-p5"></span>An eremite dressed in black vesture
and not having his hair cut, unless he has his hair cut shall be
expelled the city and be shut up in his monastery.

<span id="xiv.iii.xliii-p6"></span>It may not be irreverent to remark
that this species of impostors always has been common in the East, and
many examples will be found of the dervishes in the Arabian Nights and
other Eastern tales.  The “vagabond” monks of the West also became a
great nuisance as well as a scandal in the Middle Ages.  The reader will
find interesting instances of Spanish deceivers of the same sort in “Gil
Blas” and other Spanish romances.
