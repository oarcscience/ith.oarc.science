id="xiv.iii.xxx-p1.1"></span>Canon XXIX.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.xxx-p2"></span>A <span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.xxx-p2.1"></span>canon</span> of the Synod of Carthage says
that the holy mysteries of the altar are not to be performed but by men
who are fasting, except on one day in the year on which the Supper of
the Lord is celebrated.  At that time, on account perhaps of certain
occasions in those places useful to the Church, even the holy Fathers
themselves made use of this dispensation.  But since nothing leads us to
abandon exact observance, we decree that the Apostolic and Patristic
tradition shall be followed; and define that it is not right to break
the fast on the fifth feria of the last week of Lent, and thus to do
dishonour to the whole of Lent.

id="xiv.iii.xxx-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XXIX.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.xxx-p5"></span>*Some of the Fathers after they had
supped on the day of the Divine Supper made the offering.* <span
id="fr_366"></span>[367](#fn_366) *  However, it has seemed good to the
synod that this should not be done, and that the fast should not be
broken upon the fifth feria* <span id="fr_367"></span>[368](#fn_367) *of
the last week of Lent, and so the whole of Lent be dishonoured.*

<span id="xiv.iii.xxx-p8"></span>Zonaras remarks that the “Apostolic and
Patristic tradition” is a reference to canon lxix. of the Apostolic
Canons and to canon l. of Laodicea.  See notes on this last canon.
