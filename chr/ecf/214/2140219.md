<span id="viii.vii.iii.liii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.vii.iii.liii-p2.1"></span>They</span> who are baptized must
after Baptism be anointed with the heavenly chrism, and be partakers of
the Kingdom of Christ.

id="viii.vii.iii.liii-p4.4"></span>Canon</span> XLVIII.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.liii-p5"></span>Those illuminated should after
their baptism be anointed.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.liii-p7"></span>That this canon refers to the
anointing with chrism on the forehead of the baptized, that is to say of
the sacrament of confirmation, is the unanimous opinion of the Greek
commentators, and Balsamon notes that this anointing is not simply
styled “chrism” but “the heavenly chrism,” viz.:  “that which is
sanctified by holy prayers and through the invocation of the Holy
Spirit; and those who are anointed therewith, it sanctifies and makes
partakers of the kingdom of heaven.”

<span id="viii.vii.iii.liii-p9"></span>(*Lib*. i., *Observat. cap*. xv.)

<span id="viii.vii.iii.liii-p10"></span>Formerly no one was esteemed
worthy of the name Christian or reckoned among the perfect who had not
been confirmed and endowed with the gift of the Holy Ghost.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.liii-p11"></span>The prayers for the consecration
of the Holy Chrism according to the rites of the East and of the West
should be carefully read by the student.  Those of the East are found in
the Euchologion, and those of the West in the *Pontificale Romanum*, De
Officio in feria v. Cœna Domini.
