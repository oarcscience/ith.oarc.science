<span id="xi.xviii.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xi.xviii.xi-p1.1"></span>Canon XI.</span>

<span id="xi.xviii.xi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xi.xviii.xi-p2.1"></span>We</span> have decreed that the poor and
those needing assistance shall travel, after examination, with letters
merely pacifical from the church, and not with letters commendatory,
inasmuch as letters commendatory ought to be given only to persons who
are open to suspicion.

<span id="xi.xviii.xi-p3"></span><span class="c4"><span

<span id="xi.xviii.xi-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xi.xviii.xi-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XL.</span>

<span id="xi.xviii.xi-p5"></span>Let the poor who stand in need of help
make their journey with letters pacificatory and not commendatory:  For
letters commendatory should only be given to those who are open to
suspicion.

<span id="xi.xviii.xi-p6"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xi.xviii.xi-p6.1"></span>Aristenus.</span>

<span id="xi.xviii.xi-p7"></span>…The poor who need help should journey
with letters pacificatory from the bishop, so that those who have the
ability to help them may be moved with pity.  These need no letters
commendatory, such letters should be shown, however, by presbyters and
deacons, and by the rest of the clergy.

<span id="xi.xviii.xi-p8"></span>See notes on canons vij., viij., and
xj. of Antioch; and on canon xlij. of Laodicea.

<span id="xi.xviii.xi-p9"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xi.xviii.xi-p9.1"></span>Hefele.</span>

<span id="xi.xviii.xi-p10"></span>The mediaeval commentators, Balsamon,
Zonaras, and Aristenus, understand this canon to mean that letters of
commendation, <span class="Greek"><span
id="xi.xviii.xi-p10.1"></span>συστατικαὶ</span> , *commendatitiæ
litteræ* were given to those laymen and clerics who were previously
subject to ecclesiastical censure, and therefore were suspected by other
bishops, and for this reason needed a special recommendation, in order
to be received in another church into the number of the faithful.  The
letters of peace (<span class="Greek"><span
id="xi.xviii.xi-p10.2"></span>εἰρηνικαί</span>) on the contrary, were
given to those who were in undisturbed communion with their bishop, and
had not the least evil reputation abroad.

<span id="xi.xviii.xi-p11"></span>Our canon was understood quite
differently by the old Latin writers, Dionysius Exiguus and Isidore, who
translate the words <span class="Greek"><span
id="xi.xviii.xi-p11.1"></span>ἐν ὑπολήψει</span> by *personæ
honoratiores* and *clariores*, and the learned Bishop Gabriel Aubespine
of Orleans has endeavored to prove, in his notes to our canon, that the
*litteræ pacificæ* were given to ordinary believers, and the
*commendatitiæ* (<span class="Greek"><span
id="xi.xviii.xi-p11.2"></span>συστατικαί</span>) on the contrary, only
to clerics and to distinguished laymen; and in favour of this view is
the xiii. canon of Chalcedon.

<span id="xi.xviii.xi-p12"></span>With regard to this much-vexed point,
authorities are so divided that no absolute judgment can be arrived at. 
The interpretation I have followed is that of the Greeks and of
Hervetus, which seems to be supported by Apostolic Canon XIII., and was
that adopted by Johnson and Hammond.  On the other hand are the
*Prisca*, Dionysius, Isidore, Tillemont, Routh, and to these Bright
seems to unite himself by saying that this “sense is the more natural.”
