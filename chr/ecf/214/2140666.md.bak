<span id="xv.v.iii-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.v.iii-p4.1"></span>In</span> the consulate of our most religious
and beloved-of-God Emperors, Flavius Arcadius Augustus, for the third
time, and Honorius for the second time, on the third day before the
calends of October, in the baptistery of the most holy church of
Constantinople, when the most holy bishops had taken their seats \[*here
follow the names*\], Nectarius, the bishop of Constantinople, said: 
Since by the grace of God this synod has met in this holy place, if the
synod of my holy brethren and fellow ministers in holy things thinks
good, since I see our brothers Bagadius and Agapius, who contend between
themselves about the bishopric of Bostra, are also present, let these
begin to set forth their mutual rights.  And after some things had been
done by them for the sake of this cause, and it had been shewn that the
afore-named Bagadius was deposed by only two bishops, both of whom were
dead, Arabianus, bishop of Ancyra, said:  Not on account of this
judgment, but fearing henceforth for my whole life, I desire the holy
Synod to make a decree, whether or no, a bishop can be deposed by only
two bishops, and whether the Metropolitan is absent or not, without
prejudice to the present cause.  For I fear that some, taking their
power from these acts, may dare to attempt such things.  I wish
therefore your response.

<span id="xv.v.iii-p5"></span>Nectarius, the bishop of Constantinople,
said:  The most religious bishop Arabianus hath spoken most laudably. 
But since it is impossible to go backward in judgment, let us, without
condemning that which is past, establish things for the future. 
Arabianus, bishop of Ancyra, said:  The synod of blessed fathers who met
at Nice condemns what has taken place, for it orders that not less than
three shall ordain, nor even so without the metropolitan.  But of the
future I, full of fear, have made this question.  I would wish therefore
that you would say clearly and without delay or doubt, that a bishop
could not, according to the decree of the Synod of Nice, lawfully be
ordained or deposed by two men.

<span id="xv.v.iii-p6"></span>And, after some further debate,
Theophilus, the bishop of Alexandria, said:  Against those who have gone
forth, no sentence of indignation can be pronounced, since those to be
condemned were not present.  But if any one were to consider those who
are to be deposed in future, it seems to me that not only these ought to
assemble, but so far as possible all the other provincials, that by the
sentence of many there may be rendered a more accurate condemnation of
him who is present and is being judged, and who deserves deposition. 
Nectarius, the bishop of Constantinople, said:  Since, the controversy
is concerning legitimate institutions and decrees, it follows that
nothing must be decreed on account of personal causes.  Wherefore as the
most holy bishop Arabianus has said, wishing to make the future certain,
the sentence of the most holy bishop Theophilus hath consistently and
considerately decreed that for the future it shall be lawful not even
for three, far less for two bishops to depose him who is examined as a
defendant:  but by the sentence of the greater synod and of the bishops
of the province, according to the Apostolic Canons.  Flavian, the bishop
of Antioch, said:  What things the most holy bishop Nectarius, and the
most holy bishop Theophilus have set forth are clearly right.  And all
the ecclesiastics agreed with these.

<span id="xv.v.iii-p9"></span>In future when a defendant is examined, he
ought not to be deposed by two or three bishops:  but by the sentence of
the greater Synod and of his own provincials, as also the Apostolic
Canons provide.

<span id="xv.v.iii-p11"></span>As Bagadius, the bishop of Bostra, had
been deposed by only two bishops, the matter was considered in the synod
at Constantinople, whether that deposition had been rightly decreed. 
Agapius, the elect, laying claim to it under the decision.  And it was
decreed that the deposition was not canonical, since not two but a
number should judge of those accusations which are made against
bishops.  But know that this constitution has no force to-day, for by
the twelfth canon of the synod of Carthage, which is much later, crimes
charged against bishops are to be judged of by twelve bishops.  Read
that canon, and know that this synod was held in the time of the Emperor
Arcadius, while that of Carthage was in the days of Theodosius the
younger.

gone forth” in the speech of Theophilus of Alexandria is to be
understood have died.
