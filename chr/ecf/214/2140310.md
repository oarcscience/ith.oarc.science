by the grace of God according to the constitution of our most pious and
beloved of God emperors assembled together at Chalcedon the city of
Bithynia, in the martyry of the most holy and victorious Martyr Euphemia
to Dioscorus.

<span id="xi.x-p4"></span>We do you to wit that on the thirteenth day of
the month of October you were deposed from the episcopate and made a
stranger to all ecclesiastical order (<span class="Greek"><span
id="xi.x-p4.1"></span>θεσμοῦ</span> ) by the holy and ecumenical synod,
on account of your disregard of the divine canons, and of your
disobedience to this holy and ecumenical synod and on account of the
other crimes of which you have been found guilty, for even when called
to answer your accusers three times by this holy and great synod
according to the divine canons you did not come.
