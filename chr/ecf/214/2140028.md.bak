prevailed that the Bishop of Ælia \[*i.e.*, Jerusalem\] should be
honoured, let him, saving its due dignity to the Metropolis, have the
next place of honour.

id="vii.vi.x-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon VII.</span>

<span id="vii.vi.x-p5"></span>Let the Bishop of Ælia be honoured, the
rights of the Metropolis being preserved intact.

<span id="vii.vi.x-p6"></span>There would seem to be a singular fitness
in the Holy City Jerusalem holding a very exalted position among the
sees of Christendom, and it may appear astonishing that in the earliest
times it was only a suffragan see to the great Church of Cæsarea.  It
must be remembered, however, that only about seventy years after our
Lord’s death the city of Jerusalem was entirely destroyed and ploughed
as a field according to the prophet.  As a holy city Jerusalem was a
thing of the past for long years, and it is only in the beginning of the
second century that we find a strong Christian Church growing up in the
rapidly increasing city, called no longer Jerusalem, but Ælia
Capitolina.  Possibly by the end of the second century the idea of the
holiness of the site began to lend dignity to the occupant of the see;
at all events Eusebius <span id="fr_64"></span>[65](#fn_64.md) tells us
that “at a synod held on the subject of the Easter controversy in the
time of Pope Victor, Theophilus of Cæsarea and Narcissus of Jerusalem
were presidents.”

<span id="vii.vi.x-p8"></span>It was this feeling of reverence which
induced the passing of this seventh canon.  It is very hard to determine
just what was the “precedence” granted to the Bishop of Ælia, nor is it
clear which is the metropolis referred to in the last clause.  Most
writers, including Hefele, Balsamon, Aristenus and Beveridge consider it
to be Cæsarea; while Zonaras thinks Jerusalem to be intended, a view
recently adopted and defended by Fuchs; <span
id="fr_65"></span>[66](#fn_65.md) others again suppose it is Antioch that
is referred to.
