<span id="xiv.iii.lxii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.lxii-p2.1"></span>Those</span> who give themselves up to
soothsayers or to those who are called hecatontarchs or to any such, in
order that they may learn from them what things <span
id="fr_375"></span>[376](#fn_375) they wish to have revealed to them,
let all such, according to the decrees lately made by the Fathers
concerning them, be subjected to the canon of six years.  And to this
\[penalty\] they also should be subjected who carry about <span
id="fr_376"></span>[377](#fn_376) she-bears or animals of the kind for
the diversion and injury of the simple; as well as those who tell
fortunes and fates, and genealogy, and a multitude of words of this kind
from the nonsense of deceit and imposture.  Also those who are called
expellers of clouds, enchanters, amulet-givers, and soothsayers.

<span id="xiv.iii.lxii-p5"></span>And those who persist in these things,
and do not turn away and flee from pernicious and Greek pursuits of this
kind, we declare are to be thrust out of the Church, as also the sacred
canons say.  “For what fellowship hath light with darkness?” as saith
the Apostle, “or what agreement is there between the temple of God and
idols? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel?  And what
concord hath Christ with Belial?”

id="xiv.iii.lxii-p7.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon LXI.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.lxii-p8"></span>Whoever shall deliver himself over to
a hecatontarch or to devils, so as to learn some secret, he shall be put
under penance for six years.  So too those who take around a bear, who
join themselves with those who seek incantations and drive away the
clouds, and have faith in fortune and fate, shall be cast out of the
assembly of the Church.

<span id="xiv.iii.lxii-p10"></span>According to Balsamon (in Beveridge,
*Synod*., Tom. I., p. 228) old people who had the reputation of special
knowledge \[were called “hecatontarchs”\].  They sold the hair \[of
these she bears and other animals\] as medicine or for an amulet.  *Cf*.
Balsamon and Zonaras *ut supra*.

<span id="xiv.iii.lxii-p11"></span>St. Chrysostom in his Homilies on the
Statutes explains, in answer to certain who defended them on this
ground, that if these incantations are made in the name of Christ they
are so much the worse.  The Saint says, “Moreover I think that she is to
be hated all the more who abuses the name of God for this purpose,
because while professing to be a Christian, she shows by her actions
that she is a heathen.”
