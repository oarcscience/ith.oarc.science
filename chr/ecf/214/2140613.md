<span id="xv.iv.iv.xc-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xc-p1.1"></span>Canon LXXXIX.  (Greek xcii.)</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xc-p2"></span>That bishops who are ordained shall
receive letters from their ordainers bearing the date and the name of
the consul.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xc-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xc-p3.1"></span>It</span> further seemed good that whoever
thereafter should be ordained by the bishops throughout the African
provinces, should receive from their ordainers letters, written in their
own hands, containing the name of the consul and the date, that no
altercation might arise concerning which were ordained first and which
afterwards.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xc-p5"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xc-p5.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon LXXXIX.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xc-p6"></span>Whoever is ordained in Africa let him
have letters signed by the proper hand of him that ordained him,
containing the date and the name of the Consul.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xc-p7"></span>This is Canon iij. of Milevis, <span
class="sc"><span id="xv.iv.iv.xc-p7.1"></span>a.d.</span> 402.

id="xv.iv.iv.xc-p8.1"></span>Johnson.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xc-p9"></span>It is evident from this canon that the
church in this age followed the date of the civil government, which was
in the consulship of Caius and Titius, as our civil date is in the 1st,
2d, 3d, etc., year of the reign of our King or Queen.
