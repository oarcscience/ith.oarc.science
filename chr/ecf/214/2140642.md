id="xv.iv.iv.cxix-p1.1"></span>Canon CXVIII.  (Greek cxix.)</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxix-p2"></span>How bishops as well Catholic as those
who have been converted from the Donatists are to divide between
themselves the dioceses.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxix-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.cxix-p3.1"></span>So</span>, too, it has seemed good that
if a bishop has been converted from the Donatists to Catholic unity,
that equally there should be divided what shall have been so found where
there were two parties; that is, that some places should pertain to one
and some to the other; and let the division be made by him who has been
the longest time in the episcopate, and let the younger choose.  But
should there be only one place let it belong to him who is found to be
the nearer.  But should the distance be equal to each of the two
cathedrals let it belong to the one the people may choose.  But should
the old Catholics wish their own bishop, and if the same be the case
with the converted Donatists, let the will of the greater number
prevail, but should the parties be equal, let it belong to him who has
been longest bishop.  But if so many places be found in which there were
both parties, that an equal division is impossible, as for example, if
they are unequal in number, after those places have been distributed
which have an equal number, the place that remains over shall be
disposed of as is provided above in the case where there is but one
place to be treated.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxix-p6"></span>Those who have been converted from
Donatus, let them divide the dioceses; and let the senior bishop make
the division, and the junior choose which he will.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxix-p7"></span>This is Canon x. of Carthage, <span
