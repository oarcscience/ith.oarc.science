<span id="xvi.xiv.xix-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xvi.xiv.xix-p1.1"></span>Canon XIX.</span>

<span id="xvi.xiv.xix-p2"></span>That the vows of those in holy orders
and of monks, and of nuns are to be made without the exaction of gifts.

<span id="xvi.xiv.xix-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xvi.xiv.xix-p3.1"></span>The</span> abomination of filthy lucre has
made such inroads among the rulers of the churches, that certain of
those who call themselves religious men and women, forgetting the
commandments of the Lord have been altogether led astray, and for the
sake of money have received those presenting themselves for the
sacerdotal order and the monastic life.  And hence the first step of
those so received being unlawful, the whole proceeding is rendered null,
as says Basil the Great.  For it is not possible that God should be
served by means of mammon. <span id="fr_542"></span>[543](#fn_542.md)   If
therefore, anyone is found doing anything of this kind, if he be a
bishop or hegumenos, or one of the priesthood, either let him cease to
do so any longer or else let him be deposed, according to the second
canon of the Holy Council of Chalcedon.  If the offender be an abbess,
let her be sent away from her monastery, and placed in another in a
subordinate position.  In like manner is a hegumenos to be dealt with,
who has not the ordination of a presbyter.  With regard to what has been
given by parents as a dowry for their children, or which persons
themselves have contributed out of their own property, with the
declaration that such gifts were made to God, we have decreed, that
whether the persons in whose behalf the gifts were made, continue to
live in the monastery or not, the gifts are to remain with the monastery
in accordance with their first determination; unless indeed there be
ground for complaint against the superior.

<span id="xvi.xiv.xix-p6"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xvi.xiv.xix-p6.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XIX.</span>

<span id="xvi.xiv.xix-p7"></span>Whoever for money admits those coming
to Holy Orders or to the monastic life, if he be bishop, or superior of
a monastery or any other in sacred orders, shall either cease or be
deposed.  And the Superior of a monastery of women shall be expelled
\[if she have done so\] and shall be given over to subjection.  The same
shall be the case with a superior of monks, if he be not a priest.  But
the possessions brought by those who come in, let them remain, whether
the persons remain or not, provided the superior be not to blame.

<span id="xvi.xiv.xix-p8"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xvi.xiv.xix-p8.1"></span>Balsamon.</span>

<span id="xvi.xiv.xix-p9"></span>But someone may ask how it is that
canon V., orders that he that performs an ordination for money is *eo
ipso* to be deposed, whereas this canon provides that he who receives a
cleric or monk on account of a pecuniary gift is to cease or else to be
deposed.  The answer is, that whenever anyone performs an ordination for
money, according to canon V., he is to be deposed; but when it was only
a reception of a person which took place, whether into the list of the
clergy or into a monastery by reason of money, who did this is only to
be deposed, if after being denounced he persists in this evil.  The
canons therefore are diverse in their scope.  The fifth treats of
unlawful ordination, but this one of improper receptions.
