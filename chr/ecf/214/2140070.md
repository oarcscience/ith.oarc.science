<span id="viii.iii.iii.ix-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.ix-p2.1"></span>As</span> many as have not merely
apostatized, but have risen against their brethren and forced them \[to
apostatize\], and have been guilty of their being forced, let these for
three years take the place of hearers, and for another term of six years
that of prostra<span id="page_67">p. 67</span> <span
id="viii.iii.iii.ix-Page_67"></span>tors, and for another year let them
communicate without oblation, in order that, when they have fulfilled
the space of ten years, they may partake of the communion; but during
this time the rest of their life must also be enquired into.

<span id="viii.iii.iii.ix-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.ix-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon IX.</span>

<span id="viii.iii.iii.ix-p5"></span>Whoever has not only sacrificed
voluntarily but also has forced another to sacrifice, shall be a
prostrator for ten years.

<span id="viii.iii.iii.ix-p6"></span>\[It will be noticed that this
epitome does not agree with the canon, although Aristenus does not note
the discrepancy.\]

<span id="viii.iii.iii.ix-p7"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.ix-p7.1"></span>Van Espen.</span>

<span id="viii.iii.iii.ix-p8"></span>From this canon we are taught that
the circumstances of the sin that has been committed are to be taken
into account in assigning the penance.

<span id="viii.iii.iii.ix-p9"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.ix-p9.1"></span>Aristenus.</span>

<span id="viii.iii.iii.ix-p10"></span>When the ten years are past, he is
worthy of perfection, and fit to receive the divine sacraments.  Unless
perchance an examination of the rest of his life demands his exclusion
from the divine communion.
