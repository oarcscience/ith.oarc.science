<span id="vii.vi.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="vii.vi.ix-p1.1"></span>Excursus on the Extent of the Jurisdiction of
the Bishop of Rome Over the Suburbican Churches.</span>

<span id="vii.vi.ix-p2"></span>Although, as Hefele well says, “It is
evident that the Council has not in view here the primacy of the Bishop
of Rome over the whole Church, but simply his power as a patriarch,” yet
it may not be unimportant to consider what his patriarchal limits may
have been.

<span id="vii.vi.ix-p3"></span>(Hefele, *Hist. Councils*, Vol. I., p.
397.)

<span id="vii.vi.ix-p4"></span>The translation of this \[VI.\] canon by
Rufinus has been especially an apple of discord.  *Et ut apud
Alexandriam et in urbe Roma vetusta consuetudo servetur, ut vel ille
Egypti vel hic* suburbicariarum ecclesiarum *sollicitudinem gerat*.  In
the seventeenth century this sentence of Rufinus gave rise to a very
lively discussion between the celebrated jurist, Jacob Gothfried
(Gothofredus), and his friend, Salmasius, on one side, and the Jesuit,
Sirmond, on the other.  The great prefecture of Italy, which contained
about a third of the whole Roman Empire, was divided into four
vicariates, among which the vicariate of Rome was the first.  At its
head were two officers, the *prœfectus urbi* and the *vicarius urbis*. 
The *prœfectus urbi* exercised authority over the city of Rome, and
further in a suburban circle as far as the hundredth milestone.  The
boundary of the *vicarius urbis* comprised ten provinces—Campania,
Tuscia with Ombria, Picenum, Valeria, Samnium, Apulia with Calabria,
Lucania and that of the Brutii, Sicily, Sardinia, and Corsica. 
Gothfried and Salmasius maintained, that by the *regiones suburbicariæ*
the little territory of the *prœfectus urbi* must be understood; while,
according to Sirmond, these words designate the whole territory of the
*vicarius urbis*.  In our time Dr. Maasen has proved in his book, <span
id="fr_62"></span>[63](#fn_62.md) already quoted several times, that
Gothfried and Salmasius were right in maintaining that, by the *regiones
suburbicariæ*, the little territory of the *prœfectus urbi* must be
alone understood.

<span id="vii.vi.ix-p6"></span>Hefele thinks that Phillips “has proved”
that the Bishop of Rome had patriarchal rights over places outside the
limits of the ten provinces of the *vicarius urbis*; but does not agree
<span id="page_17">p. 17</span> <span id="vii.vi.ix-Page_17"></span>with
Phillips in thinking Rufinus in error.  As a matter of fact the point is
a difficult one, and has little to do with the gist of the meaning of
the canon.  One thing is certain:  the early Latin version of the
canons, called the *Prisca*, was not satisfied with the Greek wording
and made the Canon read thus:  “It is of ancient custom that the bishop
of the city of Rome should have a primacy (*principatum*), so that he
should govern with care the suburban places, <span class="sc"><span
id="vii.vi.ix-p6.1"></span>and all his own province</span>.” <span
id="fr_63"></span>[64](#fn_63.md)   Another interesting reading is that
found in several <span class="sc"><span
id="vii.vi.ix-p7.1"></span>mss.</span> which begins, “The Church of Rome
hath always had a primacy (*primatum*),” and as a matter of fact the
early date of this addition is evinced by the fact that the canon was
actually quoted in this shape by Paschasinus at the Council of
Chalcedon.

<span id="vii.vi.ix-p8"></span>Hefele further on says, “The Greek
commentators Zonaras and Balsamon (of the twelfth century) say very
explicitly, in their explanation of the Canons of Nice, that this sixth
canon confirms the rights of the Bishop of Rome as patriarch over the
whole West,” and refers to Beveridge’s *Synodicon*, Tom. I., pp. 66 and
67.  After diligent search I can find nothing to warrant the great
amplitude of this statement.  Balsamon’s interpretation is very vague,
being simply that the Bishop of Rome is over the Western Eparchies
(<span class="Greek"><span id="vii.vi.ix-p8.1"></span>τῶν ἑσπερίων
ἐπάρχιων</span>) and Zonaras still more vaguely says that <span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.vi.ix-p8.2"></span>τῶν ἑσπερίων ἄρχειν ἔθος
ἐκράτησε</span>.  That the whole West was in a general way understood to
be in the Roman Patriarchate I have no doubt, that the Greek scholiasts
just quoted deemed it to be so I think most probably the case, but it
does not seem to me that they have said so in the particular place
cited.  It seems to me that all they meant to say was that the custom
observed at Alexandria and Antioch was no purely Eastern and local
thing, for a similar state of affairs was found in the West.
