<span id="xiv.iii.xxv-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xiv.iii.xxv-p1.1"></span>Canon XXIV.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.xxv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.xxv-p2.1"></span>No</span> one who is on the priestly
catalogue nor any monk is allowed to take part in horse-races or to
assist at theatrical representations. But if any clergyman be called to
a marriage, as soon as the games begin let him rise up and go out, for
so it is ordered by the doctrine of our fathers. And if any one shall be
convicted of such an offence let him cease therefrom or be deposed.

<span id="xiv.iii.xxv-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.xxv-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XXIV.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.xxv-p5"></span>A clergyman or monk shall be deposed
who goes to horse-races, or does not leave nuptials before the players
are brought in.

<span id="xiv.iii.xxv-p7"></span>Scarcely ever were these plays
exhibited without the introduction of something contrary to honesty and
chastity.  As Lupus <span id="page_377">p. 377</span> <span
id="xiv.iii.xxv-Page_377"></span>here notes, the word “obscene” has its
derivation from these “scenic” representations.

<span id="xiv.iii.xxv-p8"></span>Rightly therefore has it been forbidden
by the sacred canons that the clergy should witness any such plays.

<span id="xiv.iii.xxv-p9"></span>In the second part of this canon by the
words “ordered by the doctrine of our fathers,” the Synod understands
the doctrine of the fathers of the synod of Laodicea, which in its canon
liv. condemned the same abuse.

<span id="xiv.iii.xxv-p10"></span>Compare the canon given in the *Corpus
Juris Canonici*, Gratian’s *Decretum*, Pars I., Dist. XXXIV. can. xix.
