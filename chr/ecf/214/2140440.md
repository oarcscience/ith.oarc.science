<span id="xiv.iii.lvii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.lvii-p2.1"></span>We</span> have likewise learned that in
the regions of Armenia and in other places certain people eat eggs and
cheese on the Sabbaths and Lord’s days of the holy lent.  It seems good
therefore that the whole Church of God which is in all the world should
follow one rule and keep the fast perfectly, and as they abstain from
everything which is killed, so also should they from eggs and cheese,
which are the fruit and produce of those animals from which we abstain. 
But if any shall not observe this law, if they be clerics, let them be
deposed; but if laymen, let them be cut off.

<span id="xiv.iii.lvii-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.lvii-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon LVI.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.lvii-p5"></span>Armenians eat eggs and cheese on the
Sabbaths in Lent.  It is determined that the whole world should abstain
from these.  If not let the offender be cast out.

<span id="xiv.iii.lvii-p7"></span>This canon shows that the ancient
Greeks, although they did not fast on the Sabbaths and Lord’s days of
Lent, nevertheless they abstained on them from flesh food; and it was
believed by them that abstinence from flesh food involved also
necessarily abstinence from all those things which have their origin
from flesh.  This also formerly was observed by the Latins in Lent, and
in certain regions is known still to be the usage.
