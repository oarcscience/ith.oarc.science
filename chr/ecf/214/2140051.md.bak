<span id="vii.viii-p4"></span>Often the mind of a deliberative assembly
is as clearly shown by the propositions it rejects as by those it
adopts, and it would seem that this doctrine is of application in the
case of the asserted attempt at this Council to pass a decree forbidding
the priesthood to live in the use of marriage.  This attempt is said to
have failed.  The particulars are as follows:

<span id="vii.viii-p5"></span><span class="sc"><span

<span id="vii.viii-p6"></span>(*Hist. Councils*, Vol. I., pp. 435 et
seqq.)

<span id="vii.viii-p7"></span>Socrates, Sozomen, and Gelasius affirm
that the Synod of Nicæa, as well as that of Elvira (can. 33), desired to
pass a law respecting celibacy.  This law was to forbid all bishops,
priests and deacons (Sozomen adds subdeacons), who were married at the
time of their ordination, to continue to live with their wives.  But,
say these historians, the law was opposed openly and decidedly by
Paphnutius, bishop of a city of the Upper Thebaïs in Egypt, a man of a
high reputation, who had lost an eye during the persecution under
Maximian.  He was also celebrated for his miracles, and was held in so
great respect by the Emperor, that the latter often kissed the empty
socket of the lost eye.  Paphnutius declared with a loud voice, “that
too heavy a yoke ought not to be laid upon the clergy; that marriage and
married intercourse are of themselves honourable and undefiled; that the
Church ought not to be injured by an extreme severity, for all could not
live in absolute continency:  in this way (by not prohibiting married
intercourse) the virtue of the wife would be much more certainly
preserved (viz. the wife of a clergyman, because she might find injury
elsewhere, if her husband withdrew from her married intercourse).  The
intercourse of a man with his lawful wife may also be a chaste
intercourse.  It would therefore be sufficient, according to the ancient
tradition of the Church, if those who had taken holy orders without
being married were prohibited from marrying afterwards; but those
clergymen who had been married only once as laymen, were not to be
separated from their wives (Gelasius adds, or being only a reader or
cantor).”  This discourse of Paphnutius made so much the more
impression, because he had never lived in matrimony himself, and had had
no conjugal intercourse.  Paphnutius, indeed, had been brought up in a
monastery, and his great purity of manners had rendered him especially
celebrated.  Therefore the Council took the serious words of the
Egyptian bishop into consideration, stopped all discussion upon the law,
and left to each cleric the responsibility of deciding the point as he
would.

<span id="vii.viii-p8"></span>If this account be true, we must conclude
that a law was proposed to the Council of Nicæa the same as one which
had been carried twenty years previously at Elvira, in Spain; this
coincidence would lead us to believe that it was the Spaniard Hosius who
proposed the law respecting celibacy at Nicæa.  The discourse ascribed
to Paphnutius, and the consequent decision of the Synod, agree very well
with the text of the *Apostolic Constitutions*, and with the whole
practice of the Greek Church in respect to celibacy.  The Greek Church
as well as the Latin accepted the principle, that whoever had taken holy
orders before marriage, ought not to be married afterwards.  In the
Latin Church, bishops, priests, deacons. and even subdeacons, were
considered to be subject to this law, because the latter were at a very
early period reckoned among the higher servants of the Church, which was
not the case in the Greek Church.  The Greek Church went so far as to
allow deacons to marry after their ordination, if previously to it they
had expressly obtained from their bishop permission to do so.  The
Council of Ancyra affirms this (c. 10).  We see that the Greek Church
wishes to leave the bishop free to decide the matter; but in reference
to priests, it also prohibited them from marrying after their
ordination.  Therefore, whilst the Latin Church exacted of those
presenting themselves for ordination, even as subdeacons, that they
should not continue to live with their wives if they were married, the
Greek Church gave no such prohibition; but if the wife of an ordained
clergyman died, the Greek Church allowed no second marriage.  The
*Apostolic Constitutions* decided this point in the same way.  To leave
their wives from a pretext of piety was also forbidden to Greek priests;
and the Synod of Gangra (c. 4) took <span id="page_52">p. 52</span>
<span id="vii.viii-Page_52"></span>up the defence of married priests
against the Eustathians.  Eustathius, however, was not alone among the
Greeks in opposing the marriage of all clerics, and in desiring to
introduce into the Greek Church the Latin discipline on this point.  St.
Epiphanius also inclined towards this side.  The Greek Church did not,
however, adopt this rigour in reference to priests, deacons, and
subdeacons, but by degrees it came to be required of bishops and of the
higher order of clergy in general, that they should live in celibacy. 
Yet this was not until after the compilation of the *Apostolic Canons*
(c. 5) and of the Constitutions; for in those documents mention is made
of bishops living in wedlock, and Church history shows that there were
married bishops, for instance Synesius, in the fifth century.  But it is
fair to remark, even as to Synesius, that he made it an express
condition of his acceptation, on his election to the episcopate, that he
might continue to live the married life.  Thomassin believes that
Synesius did not seriously require this condition, and only spoke thus
for the sake of escaping the episcopal office; which would seem to imply
that in his time Greek bishops had already begun to live in celibacy. 
At the Trullan Synod (c. 13.) the Greek Church finally settled the
question of the marriage of priests.  Baronius, Valesius, and other
historians, have considered the account of the part taken by Paphnutius
to be apocryphal.  Baronius says, that as the Council of Nicæa in its
third canon gave a law upon celibacy it is quite impossible to admit
that it would alter such a law on account of Paphnutius.  But Baronius
is mistaken in seeing a law upon celibacy in that third canon; he
thought it to be so, because, when mentioning the women who might live
in the clergyman’s house—his mother, sister, etc.—the canon does not say
a word about the wife.  It had no occasion to mention her, it was
referring to the <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.viii-p8.1"></span>συνεισάκτοι</span> whilst these <span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.viii-p8.2"></span>συνεισάκτοι</span> and
married women have nothing in common.  Natalis Alexander gives this
anecdote about Paphnutius in full:  he desired to refute Ballarmin, who
considered it to be untrue and an invention of Socrates to please the
Novatians.  Natalis Alexander often maintains erroneous opinions, and on
the present question he deserves no confidence.  If, as St. Epiphanius
relates, the Novatians maintained that the clergy might be married
exactly like the laity, it cannot be said that Socrates shared that
opinion, since he says, or rather makes Paphnutius say, that, according
to *ancient* tradition, those not married at the time of ordination
should not be so subsequently.  Moreover, if it may be said that
Socrates had a partial sympathy with the Novatians, he certainly cannot
be considered as belonging to them, still less can he be accused of
falsifying history in their favour.  He may sometimes have propounded
erroneous opinions, but there is a great difference between that and the
invention of a whole story.  Valesius especially makes use of the
argument *ex silentio* against Socrates.  (a) Rufinus, he says, gives
many particulars about Paphnutius in his *History of the Church*; he
mentions his martyrdom, his miracles, and the Emperor’s reverence for
him, but not a single word of the business about celibacy.  (b) The name
of Paphnutius is wanting in the list of Egyptian bishops present at the
Synod.  These two arguments of Valesius are weak; the second has the
authority of Rufinus himself against it, who expressly says that Bishop
Paphnutius was present at the Council of Nicæa.  If Valesius means by
lists only the signatures at the end of the acts of the Council, this
proves nothing; for these lists are very imperfect, and it is well known
that many bishops whose names are not among these signatures were
present at Nicæa.  This argument *ex silentio* is evidently insufficient
to prove that the anecdote about Paphnutius must be rejected as false,
seeing that it is in perfect harmony with the practice of the ancient
Church, and especially of the Greek Church, on the subject of clerical
marriages.  On the other hand, Thomassin pretends that there was no such
practice, and endeavours to prove by quotations from St. Epiphanius, St.
Jerome, Eusebius, and St. John Chrysostom, that even in the East priests
who were married at the time of their ordination were prohibited from
continuing to live with their wives.  The texts quoted by Thomassin
prove only that the Greeks gave especial honour to priests living in
perfect continency, but they do not prove that this continence was a
duty incumbent upon all priests; and so much the less, as the fifth and
twenty-fifth Apostolic canons, the fourth canon of Gangra, and the
thirteenth of the Trullan Synod, demonstrate clearly enough what was the
universal custom of the Greek Church on this point.  Lupus and Phillips
explained the words of Paphnutius in another sense.  According to them,
the Egyptian bishop was not speaking in a general way; he simply desired
that the contemplated law should not include the subdeacons.  But this
explanation does not agree with the extracts quoted from Socrates,
Sozomen, and Gelasius, who believe Paphnutius intended deacons and
priests as well.
