<span id="viii.vii.iii.ix-p7"></span>This synod here declares the
baptism of the Montanists invalid, while in the preceding canon it
recognised as valid the baptism of the Novatians and Quartodecimans. 
From this, it would appear that the Montanists were suspected of heresy
with regard to the doctrine of the Trinity.  Some other authorities of
the ancient Church, however, judged differently, and for a long time it
was a question in the Church whether to consider the baptism of the
Montanists valid or not.  Dionysius the Great of Alexandria was in
favour of its validity:  but this Synod and the Second General Council
rejected it as invalid, not to mention the Synod of Iconium (235), which
declared all heretical baptism invalid.  This uncertainty of the ancient
Church is accounted for thus:  (a) On one side the Montanists, and
especially Tertullian, asserted that they held the same faith and
sacraments, especially the same baptism (*eadem lavacri sacramenta*) as
the Catholics.  St. Epiphanius concurred in this, and testified that the
Montanists taught the same regarding the Father, the Son, and the Holy
Ghost, as did the Catholic Church.  (b) Other Fathers, however, thought
less favourably of them, and for this reason, that the Montanists often
expressed themselves so ambiguously, that they might, nay, must be said
completely to identify the Holy Ghost with Montanus.  Thus Tertullian in
quoting expressions of Montanus, actually says:  “the Paraclete speaks”;
and therefore Firmilian, Cyril of Jerusalem, Basil the Great, and other
Fathers, did in fact, reproach the Montanists with this identification,
and consequently held their baptism to be invalid.  (c) Basil the Great
goes to the greatest length in this direction in maintaining that the
Montanists had baptized in the name of the Father, of the Son, and of
Montanus and Priscilla.  But it is very probable, as Tillemont
conjectured, that Basil only founded these strange stories of their
manner of baptizing upon his assumption that they identified Montanus
with the Holy Ghost; and, as Baronius maintains, it is equally “probable
that the Montanists did not alter the form of baptism.  But, even
admitting all this, their ambiguous expressions concerning Montanus and
the Holy Ghost would alone have rendered it advisable to declare their
baptism invalid.”  (d) Besides this, a considerable number of
Montanists, namely, the school of Æschines, fell into Sabellianism, and
thus their baptism was decidedly invalid.  (*Vide* Article in Wetzer and
Welte *Kirchenlexicon s.v.* Montanus; by myself \[i.e. Hefele\]).

<span id="viii.vii.iii.ix-p8"></span>In conclusion, it must be observed
that Balsamon and Zonaras rightly understood the words in our text,
“even though they be called the very chiefest,” “though they be held in
the highest esteem,” to refer to the most distinguished clergy and
teachers of the Montanists.
