id="x.iii-p1.1"></span>Note on the Emperor’s Edict to the Synod.</span>

<span id="x.iii-p2"></span>Neither of the Emperors could personally
attend the Council of Ephesus and accordingly Theodosius II. appointed
the Count Candidian, Captain of the imperial bodyguard, the protector of
the council, to sit in the room of the Emperors.  In making this
appointment he addressed an edict to the synod which will be found in
the *Concilia* and of which Hefele gives the following synopsis.

<span id="x.iii-p3"></span>(Hefele, *Hist. of the Councils*, Vol. III.,
p. 43.)

<span id="x.iii-p4"></span>Candidian is to take no immediate part in the
discussions on contested points of faith, for it is not becoming that
one who does not belong to the number of the bishops should mix himself
up in the examination and decision of theological controversies.  On the
contrary, Candidian was to remove from the city the monks and laymen who
had come or should afterwards come to Ephesus out of curiosity, so that
disorder and confusion should not be caused by those who were in no way
needed for the examination of the sacred doctrines.  He was, besides, to
watch lest the discussions among the members of the Synod themselves
should degenerate into violent disputes and hinder the more exact
investigation of truth; and, on the contrary, see that every statement
should be heard with attention, and that every one put forward in view,
or his objections, without let or hindrance, so that at last an
unanimous decision might be arrived at in peace by the holy Synod.  But
above all, Candidian was to take care that no member of the Synod should
attempt, before the close of the transactions, to go home, or to the
court, or elsewhere.  Moreover, he was not to allow that any other
matter of controversy should be taken into consideration before the
settlement of the principal point of doctrine before the Council.
