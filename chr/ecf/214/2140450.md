id="xiv.iii.lxvii-p1.1"></span>Canon LXVI.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.lxvii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.lxvii-p2.1"></span>From</span> the holy day of the
Resurrection of Christ our God until the next Lord’s day, for a whole
week, in the holy churches the faithful ought to be free from labour,
rejoicing in Christ with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs; and
celebrating the feast, and applying their minds to the reading of the
holy Scriptures, and delighting in the Holy Mysteries; for thus shall we
be exalted with Christ and together with him be raised up.  Therefore,
on the aforesaid days there must not be any horse races or any public
spectacle.

id="xiv.iii.lxvii-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon LXVI.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.lxvii-p5"></span>The faithful shall every one of them
go to church during the whole week after Easter.

<span id="xiv.iii.lxvii-p7"></span>It is certain that the whole of
Easter week was kept as a feast by the whole Church both East and West;
and this Synod did not introduce this custom by its canon, but adopted
this canon to ensure its continuance.

<span id="xiv.iii.lxvii-p8"></span>Here we have clearly set forth the
Christian manner of passing a feast-day, viz., that the faithful on
those days did give themselves up to “Psalms and Hymns and Spiritual
Songs,” from which the divine office which we call today canonical
\[i.e., chiefly Mattins and Vespers\] are made up; and hence we
understand that all the faithful ought to attend the choir-offices,
which was indeed observed for many centuries, as I have shewn in my
*Dissertation on the Canonical Hours*, cap. III., § 1, and therefore it
was called “public” \[or common\] prayer.
