id="xv.iv.iv.xciii-p1.1"></span>Canon XCII.  (Greek xcv.)</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xciii-p2"></span>Form of convening the Donatists.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xciii-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xciii-p3.1"></span>That</span> bishop of that church said: 
What by the authority of that most ample see we shall have impetrated,
we ask your gravity to have read, and that you order it to be joined to
the acts and carried into effect.  When the jussio had been read and
joined to the acts, the bishop of the Catholic Church, <span
id="fr_469"></span>[470](#fn_469.md) said:  Vouchsafe to listen to the
mandate to be sent through your gravity to the Donatists, and to insert
it in the acts, and to carry it to them, and informs us in your acts of
their answer.  “We, sent by the authority of our Catholic Council, have
called you together, desiring to rejoice in your correction, bearing in
mind the charity of the Lord who said:  Blessed are the peacemakers, for
they shall be called the children of God; and moreover he admonished
through the prophet those who say they are not our brothers, that we
ought to say:  Ye are our brethren.  Therefore you ought not to despise
this pacific commonitory coming of love, so that if ye think we have any
part of the truth, ye do not hesitate to say so:  that is, when your
council is gathered together, ye delegate of your number certain to whom
you intrust the statement of your case; so that we may be able to do
this also, that there shall be delegated from our Council who with them
delegated by you may discuss peacefully, at a determined place and time,
whatever question there is which separates your communion from us; and
that at length the old error may receive an end through the assistance
of our Lord God, lest through the animosity of men, weak souls, and
ignorant <span id="page_488">p. 488</span> <span
id="xv.iv.iv.xciii-Page_488"></span>people should perish by sacrilegious
dissension.  But if ye shall accept this proposition in a fraternal
spirit, the truth will easily shine forth, but if ye are not willing to
do this, your distrust will be easily known.”  And when this had been
read, all the bishops said:  This pleases us well, so let it be.  And
they subscribed:  I, Aurelius, bishop of the Carthaginian Church, have
consented to this decree, and having read it, have subscribed it. 
Likewise also the rest of the bishops signed.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xciii-p5"></span>This synod sent a legation to the
Princes against the Donatists.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xciii-p6"></span>The most glorious emperor Honorius
Augustus, being consul for the sixth time, on the Calends of July, at
Carthage in the basilica of the second region.  In this council Theasius
and Euodius received a legation against the Donatists.  In this council
was inserted the commonitorium which follows.

id="xv.iv.iv.xciii-p8.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XCII.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xciii-p9"></span>What things should be said to the
Donatists are these:  “We greatly desire to rejoice in your conversion;
for we have been commanded to say even to those not desiring to be our
brethren, ‘Ye are our brothers.’  We come therefore to you and we exhort
you that if you have any defence to make, ye should appoint certain
persons to whom this should be entrusted, who, at a fixed time and
place, shall urge your case; otherwise your distrust wilt be
thenceforward patent.”

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xciii-p10"></span>This canon is Canon ij. of the
Synod of Carthage of August 25, <span class="sc"><span
