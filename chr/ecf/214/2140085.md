id="viii.iii.iii.xxiv-p2.1"></span>Concerning</span> involuntary
homicides, a former decree directs that they be received to full
communion after seven years \[of penance\], according to the prescribed
degrees; but this second one, that they fulfil a term of five years.

id="viii.iii.iii.xxiv-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon
XXIII.</span>

<span id="viii.iii.iii.xxiv-p5"></span>An involuntary homicide shall be
subjected to penance for five years.

<span id="viii.iii.iii.xxiv-p6"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.xxiv-p6.1"></span>Van Espen.</span>

<span id="viii.iii.iii.xxiv-p7"></span>Of voluntary and involuntary
homicides St. Basil treats at length in his *Canonical Epistle ad
Amphilochium*, can. viii., lvi. and lvii., and fixes the time of penance
at twenty years for voluntary and ten years for involuntary homicides. 
It is evident that the penance given for this crime varied in different
churches, although it is clear from the great length of the penance, how
enormous the crime was considered, no light or short penance being
sufficient.
