id="xv.iv.iv.xcii-p1.1"></span>Canon XCI.  (Greek xciv.)</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xcii-p2"></span>Of holding meetings with the
Donatists.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xcii-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xcii-p3.1"></span>Aurelius</span>, the bishop, said:  What
has come out in the handling of your charity, I think this should be
confirmed by ecclesiastical acts.  For the profession of all of you
shews that each one of us should call together in his city the chiefs of
the Donatists either alone and with one of his neighbour bishops, so
that in like manner in the different cities and places there should be
meetings of them assembled by the magistrates or seniors of the places. 
And let this be made an edict if it seems good to all.  And all the
bishops said:  It seems good to all, and we all have confirmed this with
our subscription.  Also we desire that your holiness sign the letters to
be sent from the council to the judges.  Aurelius, the bishop, said:  If
it seems good to your charity, let the form of summoning them be read,
in order that we all may hold the same tenour of proceeding.  All the
bishops said:  Let it be read.  Lætus the Notary read.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xcii-p6"></span>Let each of the bishops meet with the
leaders of the Donatists in his own city; or let him associate with
himself a neighbouring bishop, that they together may meet them.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xcii-p7"></span>This introduction together with the
propositions of the different bishops belongs to the Synod of Carthage
of August, 403.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xcii-p8"></span>This canon (xcj.) is Canon j. of that
synod.
