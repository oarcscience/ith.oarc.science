<span id="xv.iv.iv.x-p2"></span>Of those who on account of their deeds
are justly cast forth from the congregation of the Church.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.x-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.x-p3.1"></span>Augustine</span> the bishop, the legate of
the Numidian province, said:  Deign to enact that if any perchance have
been rightly on account of their crimes cast forth from the Church, and
shall have been received into communion by some bishop or presbyter,
such shall be considered as guilty of an equal crime with them who flee
away from the judgment of their own bishop.  And all the bishops said: 
This is the pleasure of all of us.
