<span id="viii.vii.iii.xviii-p7"></span>It was well to separate the
Psalms by lessons when the congregation was gathered in church, and not
to keep them continuously singing unbroken psalmody, lest those who had
assembled might become careless through weariness.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xviii-p9"></span>This was an ancient custom which
has been laid aside since the new order of ecclesiastical matters has
been instituted. <span id="fr_177"></span>[178](#fn_177.md)

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xviii-p12"></span>Here it may be remarked we find
the real reason why in our present rite, the lections, verses, etc., of
the nocturns are placed between the Psalms, so as to repel weariness.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xviii-p10"></span> I do not understand this note,
as to-day in the Divine Office of the Greek Church the Psalms are still
divided by Lessons.  Vide *The* <span
