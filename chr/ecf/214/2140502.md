sagacity determine, that <span id="fr_390"></span>[391](#fn_390)
—inasmuch as this was decreed in order that a bishop might not fall
under censure by going to the Court—that if any have such petitions as
we mentioned above, they should send these by one of their deacons.  For
the person of a subordinate does not excite jealousy, and what shall be
granted \[by the Emperor\] can thus be reported more quickly.

<span id="xv.iii.iv.viii-p5"></span>All answered:  Be this also decreed.

id="xv.iii.iv.viii-p7.2"></span>Hosius</span> said:  This also your
forethought should provide for—inasmuch as ye have made this decree in
order that the audacity of bishops might not labour \[or, be observed\]
to go to Court.  Whosoever therefore shall have or receive petitions
such as we have mentioned above, let them send these \[each\] by a
deacon of his, because the person of a minister is not an object of
jealousy, and he will be able to report more quickly what he has
obtained.

<span id="xv.iii.iv.viii-p12"></span>This decree is threefold.  First,
that the bishop in going to Court should not fall under suspicion either
at Court or of his own people that he was approaching the Prince to
obtain some cause of his own.  Second, according to the interpretation
of Zonaras, “that no one should be angry with the Minister or Deacon who
tarried in camp, as the bishop had departed thence.”  And third, that
the Minister could carry away what he had asked for, that is (according
to Zonaras), the letters of the Emperor pardoning the fault, or such
like other matters.
