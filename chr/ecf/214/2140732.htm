<p class="c14"><a name="xvii.xii-p1"></A> <span class="c4"><a name="xvii.xii-p1.1"></A>The Second Canonical Epistle of the Same.</span></p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="xvii.xii-p2"></A>(<i>This is found translated in the same volume last referred to</i>, Epistle cxcix., <i>p</i>. 236 <i>et seqq</i>.)</p> 
<p class="c34"><a name="xvii.xii-p3"></A><span class="c4"><a name="xvii.xii-p3.1"></A>Canon XVII.</span></p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="xvii.xii-p4"></A>I made a canon, that they at Antioch, who had sworn not to perform the sacred offices should not do it publicly, but in private only:&#160; As to Bianor, he is removed from thence to Iconium, and therefore is more at liberty; but let him repent of his rash oath which he made to an infidel for avoiding a small danger.</p> 
<p class="c34"><a name="xvii.xii-p5"></A><span class="c4"><a name="xvii.xii-p5.1"></A>Canon XVIII.</span></p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="xvii.xii-p6"></A>That the ancients received a professed virgin that had married, as one guilty of digamy, viz., upon one year&#146;s penance; but they ought to be dealt with more severely than widows professing continency, and even as adulterers:&#160; But they ought not to be admitted to profess virginity till they are above sixteen or seventeen years of age, after trial, and at their own earnest request; whereas relations often offer them that are under age, for their own secular ends, but such ought not easily to be admitted.</p> 
<p class="c34"><a name="xvii.xii-p7"></A><span class="c4"><a name="xvii.xii-p7.1"></A>Canon XIX.</span></p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="xvii.xii-p8"></A>That men, though they seem tacitly to promise celibacy, by becoming monks, yet do it not expressly; yet I think fit that they <A NAME="page_606"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 606</FONT></A> <a name="xvii.xii-Page_606"></A>be interrogated too, and that a profession should be demanded of them, that if they betake themselves to a carnal life, they may be punished as fornicators.</p> 
<p class="c34"><a name="xvii.xii-p9"></A><span class="c4"><a name="xvii.xii-p9.1"></A>Canon XX.</span></p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="xvii.xii-p10"></A>Women professing virginity, though they did marry while they were heretics, or catechumens, yet are pardoned by baptism.&#160; What is done by persons in the state of catechumens, is never laid to their charge.</p> 
<p class="c34"><a name="xvii.xii-p11"></A><span class="c4"><a name="xvii.xii-p11.1"></A>Canon XXI.</span></p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="xvii.xii-p12"></A>A married man committing lewdness with a single woman, is severely punished as guilty of fornication, but we have no canon to treat such a man as an adulterer; but the wife must co-habit with such a one:&#160; But if the wife be lewd, she is divorced, and he that retains her is [thought] impious; such is the custom, but the reason of it does not appear.</p> 
<p class="c34"><a name="xvii.xii-p13"></A><span class="c4"><a name="xvii.xii-p13.1"></A>Canon XXII.</span></p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="xvii.xii-p14"></A>That they who have stolen virgins, and will not restore them, be treated as fornicators; that they be one year mourners, the second hearers, the third received to repentance and the fourth be co-standers, and then admitted to communion of the Good Thing.&#160; If the virgins be restored to those who had espoused them, it is at their discretion to marry them, or not; if to their guardians, it is at their discretion to give them in marriage to the raptors, or not.</p> 
<p class="c34"><a name="xvii.xii-p15"></A><span class="c4"><a name="xvii.xii-p15.1"></A>Canon XXIII.</span></p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="xvii.xii-p16"></A>That a man ought not to marry two sisters, nor a woman two brothers:&#160; That he who marries his brother&#146;s wife, be not admitted till he dismiss her.</p> 
<p class="c34"><a name="xvii.xii-p17"></A><span class="c4"><a name="xvii.xii-p17.1"></A>Canon XXIV.</span></p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="xvii.xii-p18"></A>A widow put into the catalogue of widows, that is, a deaconess being sixty years old, and marrying, is not to be admitted to communion of the Good Thing, till she cease from her uncleanness; but to a widower that marries no penance is appointed, but that of digamy.&#160; If the widow be less than sixty, it is the bishop&#146;s fault who admitted her deaconess, not the woman&#146;s.</p> 
<p class="c34"><a name="xvii.xii-p19"></A><span class="c4"><a name="xvii.xii-p19.1"></A>Canon XXV.</span></p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="xvii.xii-p20"></A>He that marries a woman that he has corrupted, shall be under penance for corrupting her, but may retain her for his wife.</p> 
<p class="c34"><a name="xvii.xii-p21"></A><span class="c4"><a name="xvii.xii-p21.1"></A>Canon XXVI.</span></p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="xvii.xii-p22"></A>Fornication is neither marriage, nor the beginning of marriage.&#160; If it may be, it is better that they who have committed fornication together be parted; but if they be passionate lovers, let them not separate, for fear of what is worse.</p> 
<p class="c34"><a name="xvii.xii-p23"></A><span class="c4"><a name="xvii.xii-p23.1"></A>Canon XXVII.</span></p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="xvii.xii-p24"></A>As for the priest that is engaged, through ignorance, in an unlawful marriage, I have decreed, that he retain the honour of the chair; but forbear all sacred operations, and not give the blessing either in private, or public, nor distribute the Body of Christ to another, nor perform any liturgy; but let him bewail himself to the Lord, and to men, that his sin of ignorance may be pardoned.</p> 
<p class="c34"><a name="xvii.xii-p25"></A><span class="c4"><a name="xvii.xii-p25.1"></A>Canon XXVIII.</span></p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="xvii.xii-p26"></A>That it is ridiculous to vow not to eat swine&#146;s flesh, and to abstain from it is not necessary.</p> 
<p class="c34"><a name="xvii.xii-p27"></A><span class="c4"><a name="xvii.xii-p27.1"></A>Canon XXIX.</span></p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="xvii.xii-p28"></A>That princes ought not to swear to wrong their subjects:&#160; that such rash oaths ought to be repented of, and evil not to be justified under pretence of religion.</p>

<p class="c18"><a name="xvii.xii-p30"></A>That they who steal women, and their accomplices, be not admitted to prayers, or be co-standers for three years.&#160; Where no violence is used, there no crime is committed, except there be lewdness in the case.&#160; A widow is at her own discretion.&#160; We must not mind vain pretences.</p> 
<p class="c34"><a name="xvii.xii-p31"></A><span class="c4"><a name="xvii.xii-p31.1"></A>Canon XXXI.</span></p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="xvii.xii-p32"></A>She, whose husband is absent from home, if she co-habits with another man, before she is persuaded of his death, commits adultery.</p> 
<p class="c34"><a name="xvii.xii-p33"></A><span class="c4"><a name="xvii.xii-p33.1"></A>Canon XXXII.</span></p>

<p class="c18"><a name="xvii.xii-p42"></A>A soldier&#146;s wife marrying after the long absence of her husband, but before she is certified of his death, is more pardonable than another woman, because it is more credible that he may be dead.</p>

<p class="c18"><a name="xvii.xii-p50"></A>She that [being a slave] gives herself up to the will of a man, without the consent of her master, commits fornication; for pacts of those who are under the power of others are null.</p>

<p class="c18"><a name="xvii.xii-p58"></A>The deaconess that has committed lewdness with a pagan is not to be received to communion, but shall be admitted to the oblation, in the seventh year&#8212;that is, if she live in chastity.&#160; The pagan, who after [he has professed] the faith, betakes himself again to sacrilege, returns [like the dog] to his vomit:&#160; we therefore do not permit the sacred body of a deaconess to be carnally used.</p> 
<p class="c34"><a name="xvii.xii-p59"></A><span class="c4"><a name="xvii.xii-p59.1"></A>Canon XLV.</span></p>

<p class="c34"><a name="xvii.xii-p63"></A><span class="c4"><a name="xvii.xii-p63.1"></A>Canon XLVII.</span></p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="xvii.xii-p64"></A>Encratites, Saccophorians, and Apotactites, are in the same case with the Novatians.&#160; We re-baptize them all.&#160; There is a diversity in the canons relating to the Novatians, no canon concerning the other.&#160; If it be forbid with you, as it is at Rome for prudential causes, yet let reason prevail.&#160; They are a branch of the Marcionists; and though they baptize in the name of the three divine Persons, yet they make God the author of evil, and assert, that wine and the creatures of God, are defiled.&#160; The bishops ought to meet, and so to explain the canon, that he who does [baptize such heretics] may be out of danger, and that one may have a positive answer to give to those that ask it.</p> 
<p class="c34"><a name="xvii.xii-p65"></A><span class="c4"><a name="xvii.xii-p65.1"></A>Canon XLVIII.</span></p>

<p class="c18"><a name="xvii.xii-p70"></A>We look on third marriages as disgraceful to the Church, but do not absolutely condemn them, as being better than a vague fornication.</p>
