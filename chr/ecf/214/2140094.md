<span id="viii.iv.iii.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="viii.iv.iii.iii-p1.1"></span>Canon III.</span>

<span id="viii.iv.iii.iii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iv.iii.iii-p2.1"></span>Concerning</span> those who fall into
many marriages, the appointed time of penance is well known; but their
manner of living and faith shortens the time.

<span id="viii.iv.iii.iii-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iv.iii.iii-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon III.</span>

<span id="viii.iv.iii.iii-p5"></span>The time of polygamists is well
known.  A zeal for penance may shorten it.

<span id="viii.iv.iii.iii-p6"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iv.iii.iii-p6.1"></span>Hefele.</span>

<span id="viii.iv.iii.iii-p7"></span>As the Greek commentators have
remarked, this canon speaks of those who have been married more than
twice.  It is not known what were the ancient ordinances of penitence
which the synod here refers to.  In later times digamists were condemned
to one year’s penance, and trigamists from two to five years.  St. Basil
places the trigamists for three years among the “hearers,” and then for
some time among the *consistentes*.

<span id="viii.iv.iii.iii-p8"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iv.iii.iii-p8.1"></span>Van Espen.</span>

<span id="viii.iv.iii.iii-p9"></span>“The appointed time of penance is
well known.”  These words Zonaras notes must refer to a custom, for,
says he, “before this synod no canon is found which prescribes the
duration of the penance of bigamists \[i.e. digamists\].”  It is for
this reason that St. Basil says (*in Epist. ad Amphilogium*, Can. 4) in
speaking of the penance of trigamists “we have received this by custom
and not by canon, but from the following of precedent,” hence the
Fathers received many things by tradition, and observed these as having
the force of law.

<span id="viii.iv.iii.iii-p10"></span>From the last clause of this canon
we see the mind of the Fathers of this synod, which agrees with that of
Ancyra and Nice, that; with regard to the granting of indulgences, for
in shortening the time of penance, attention must be paid to the
penitence, and conversation, or “conversation and faith” of each one
separately.

<span id="viii.iv.iii.iii-p11"></span>With this agrees Zonaras, whose
remarks are worthy of consideration.  On this whole subject of the
commutation of the primitive penance and of the rise of the modern
indulgences of the Roman Church Van Espen has written at length in his
excursus *De Indulgentiis* (*Jure Eccles.*, P. I. i., Tit. vij.) in
which he assigns the change to the end of the <span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iv.iii.iii-p11.1"></span>XI</span>th century, and remarks that
its introduction caused the “no small collapse of penitential
discipline.” <span id="fr_123"></span>[124](#fn_123.md)

<span id="viii.iv.iii.iii-p13"></span>This canon is found in the *Corpus
Juris Canonici*, Gratian, *Decretum*, Pars II., Causa xxxi., Quæst. i.,
c. viij. where for “conversio,” (<span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.iv.iii.iii-p13.1"></span>ἀναστροφὴ</span>) is read
“conversatio,” and the Greek word is used in this sense in Polybius, and
frequently so in the New Testament.

id="viii.iv.iii.iii-p11.2"></span>

<span id="viii.iv.iii.iii-p12"></span> The reader is referred also to
Amort, *De Origine, progressu, valore ac fructu Indulgentiarum*, and to
the article “Ablass” in the *Kirchen Lexicon* of Wetzer and Welte.  Also
for the English reader to T. L. Green, D.D., *Indulgences, Absolutions,
and Tax tables, etc*.  Some of the difficulties which Roman theologians
experience in explaining what are called “Plenary Indulgences” are set
forth by Dr. Littledale in his *Plain Reasons against joining the Church
of Rome*, in which the matter is discussed in the usual witty, and
unscrupulous fashion of that brilliant writer.  But while this remark is
just, it should also be remarked that after the exaggeration is removed
there yet remains a difficulty of the most serious character.
