<p class="c18"><a name="xiv.iii.lxvii-p2"></A><span class="sc"><a name="xiv.iii.lxvii-p2.1"></A>From</span> the holy day of the Resurrection of Christ our God until the next Lord&#146;s day, for a whole week, in the holy churches the faithful ought to be free from labour, rejoicing in Christ with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs; and celebrating the feast, and applying their minds to the reading of the holy Scriptures, and delighting in the Holy Mysteries; for thus shall we be exalted with Christ and together with him be raised up.&#160; Therefore, on the aforesaid days there must not be any horse races or any public spectacle.</p>

<p class="c36"><a name="xiv.iii.lxvii-p4"></A><span class="sc"><a name="xiv.iii.lxvii-p4.1"></A>Ancient Epitome of Canon LXVI.</span></p> 
<p class="c35"><a name="xiv.iii.lxvii-p5"></A>The faithful shall every one of them go to church during the whole week after Easter.</p> 
<p class="c36"><a name="xiv.iii.lxvii-p6"></A><span class="sc"><a name="xiv.iii.lxvii-p6.1"></A>Van Espen.</span></p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="xiv.iii.lxvii-p7"></A>It is certain that the whole of Easter week was kept as a feast by the whole Church both East and West; and this Synod did not introduce this custom by its canon, but adopted this canon to ensure its continuance.</p> 
<p class="c19"><a name="xiv.iii.lxvii-p8"></A>Here we have clearly set forth the Christian manner of passing a feast-day, viz., that the faithful on those days did give themselves up to &#8220;Psalms and Hymns and Spiritual Songs,&#8221; from which the divine office which we call today canonical [i.e., chiefly Mattins and Vespers] are made up; and hence we understand that all the faithful ought to attend the choir-offices, which was indeed observed for many centuries, as I have shewn in my <i>Dissertation on the Canonical Hours</i>, cap. III., &sect; 1, and therefore it was called &#8220;public&#8221; [or common] prayer.</p>
