<span id="xiv.iii.lxxxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xiv.iii.lxxxviii-p1.1"></span>Canon LXXXVII.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.lxxxviii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.lxxxviii-p2.1"></span>She</span> who has left her husband is
an adulteress if she has come to another, according to the holy and
divine Basil, who has gathered this most excellently from the prophet
Jeremiah:  “If a woman has become another man’s, her husband shall not
return to her, but being defiled she shall remain defiled;” and again,
“He who has an adulteress is senseless and impious.”  If therefore she
appears to have departed from her husband without reason, he is
deserving of pardon and she of punishment.  And pardon shall be given to
him that he may be in communion with the Church.  But he who leaves the
wife lawfully given him, and shall take another is guilty of adultery by
the sentence of the Lord.  And it has been decreed by our Fathers that
they who are such must be “weepers” for a year, “hearers” for two years,
“prostrators” for three years, and in the seventh year to stand with the
faithful and thus be counted worthy of the Oblation \[if with tears they
do penance\].

id="xiv.iii.lxxxviii-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon
LXXXVII.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.lxxxviii-p5"></span>She who goes from her husband to
another man is an adulteress.  And he who from his wife goes to another
woman is an adulterer according to the word of the Lord.

<span id="xiv.iii.lxxxviii-p6"></span>Compare with this canon lviij. of
St. Basil.

<span id="xiv.iii.lxxxviii-p7"></span>The words in brackets are found in
Beveridge, but were lacking in Hervetus’s text.

<span id="xiv.iii.lxxxviii-p9"></span>Here discipline is relaxed;
formerly an adulteress did fifteen years’ penance.  See *Can. Bas*.,
58.  No wonder if in 200 years’ time from St. Basil, the severity of
discipline was abated.
