<span id="xvi.xiv.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xvi.xiv.xi-p1.1"></span>Canon XI.</span>

<span id="xvi.xiv.xi-p2"></span>That Œconomi ought to be in the
Episcopal palaces and in the Monasteries.

<span id="xvi.xiv.xi-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xvi.xiv.xi-p3.1"></span>Since</span> we are under obligation to
guard all the divine canons, we ought by all means to maintain in its
integrity that one which says œconomi are to be in each church.  If the
metropolitan appoints in his Church an œconomus, he does well; but if he
does not, it is permitted to the Bishop of Constantinople by his own
(<span class="Greek"><span id="xvi.xiv.xi-p3.2"></span>ἰδίας</span>)
authority to choose an œconomus for the Church of the Metropolitan.  A
like authority belongs to the <span id="page_563">p. 563</span> <span
id="xvi.xiv.xi-Page_563"></span>metropolitans, if the Bishops who are
subject to them do not wish to appoint œconomi in their churches.  The
same rule is also to be observed with respect to monasteries.

<span id="xvi.xiv.xi-p4"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvi.xiv.xi-p4.1"></span>Notes.</span>

<span id="xvi.xiv.xi-p5"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xvi.xiv.xi-p5.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XI.</span>

<span id="xvi.xiv.xi-p6"></span>If the Metropolitan does not elect an
œconomus of the metropolis, the patriarch shall do so.  If the bishop
shall not do so, the Metropolitan shall; for so it seemed good to the
fathers assembled at Chalcedon.  The same law shall hold in monasteries.

<span id="xvi.xiv.xi-p7"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xvi.xiv.xi-p7.1"></span>Hefele.</span>

<span id="xvi.xiv.xi-p8"></span>The Synod of Chalcedon required the
appointment of special œconomi only for all bishops’ churches; but our
synod extended this prescription also to monasteries.

<span id="xvi.xiv.xi-p9"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xvi.xiv.xi-p9.1"></span>Van Espen.</span>

<span id="xvi.xiv.xi-p10"></span>Bishops at their ordination among other
things promise that they will observe the canons, and the bishops of the
Synod say that among these canons they are bound to keep the one that
orders them to appoint an Œconomus.

<span id="xvi.xiv.xi-p11"></span>Among the officials of the
Constantinopolitan Church, Codinus names first The Grand Œconomus, “who”
(he says) “holds in his own power all the faculties of the Church, and
all their returns; and is the dispenser in this matter as well to the
Patriarch as to the Church.”

<span id="xvi.xiv.xi-p12"></span>Balsamon and Aristenus refer to Canon
xxvj. of Chalcedon; and point out how here the power of Constantinople
was added to.

<span id="xvi.xiv.xi-p13"></span>This canon is found in the *Corpus
Juris Canonici*, Gratian’s *Decretum*, Pars. II., Causa IX., Quæst.
III., Canon iij.
