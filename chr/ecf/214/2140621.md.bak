<span id="xv.iv.iv.xcviii-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xcviii-p1.1"></span>Canon XCVII.  (Greek c.)</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xcviii-p2"></span>That there be sought from the
Emperor the protection of Advocates in causes ecclesiastical.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xcviii-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xcviii-p3.1"></span>It</span> seemed good that the legates
who were about leaving, viz., Vincent and Fortunatian, should in the
name of all the provinces ask from the most glorious Emperors to give a
faculty for the establishment of scholastic defensors, whose shall be
the care of this very kind of business:  so that as the priests <span
id="fr_476"></span>[477](#fn_476.md) of the province, they who have
received the faculty as defensors of the Churches in ecclesiastical
affairs, as often as necessity arises, may be able to enter the private
apartments of the judges, so as to resist what is urged on the other
side, or to make necessary explanations.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xcviii-p6"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xcviii-p6.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XCVII.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xcviii-p7"></span>That there be asked of the Emperor
the appointment of Patrons for ecclesiastical heads, whose care it
should be to defend the Church in its affairs, and who as priests could
easily refer what things were urgent.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xcviii-p8"></span>(Greek ci.)

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xcviii-p9"></span>That the legation be free.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xcviii-p10"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xcviii-p10.1"></span>It</span> seemed good that the chosen
legates should have at the meeting freedom of action (*legationem
liberam*).

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xcviii-p11"></span><span id="page_492">p. 492</span>
<span id="xv.iv.iv.xcviii-Page_492"></span>*The protest of the
Mauritanian bishops against Primosus.*

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xcviii-p12"></span>It is evident that those of
Mauritania Cæsariensis gave evidence in their own writings that Primosus
had been summoned by the chiefs of the Thiganensian city, that he should
present himself to the plenary council according to the imperial
constitutions, and, when sought for, as was right, Primosus was not
found, at least so the deacons reported.  But since the same
Mauritanians petitioned that letters be sent from the whole synod to the
venerable brother, the aged Innocent, it seemed good that they should be
sent, that he might know that Primosus had been sought at the council
and not found at all.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xcviii-p17"></span>The contents of this canon being
special are useless, therefore no explanation has been given.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xcviii-p18"></span>This Canon is Canon iij. of
Carthage, <span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xcviii-p18.1"></span>a.d.</span> 407.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xcviii-p20"></span>See can. 75 (78) and note on Can.
Chalced., 23.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xcviii-p21"></span>These officers \[i.e.
“defensors”\] seem to be called “executores” in the acts of synod just
before this canon.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xcviii-p22"></span>The “priest of the province” was
one chosen out of the body of advocates to be counsel to the province,
to act and plead in their behalf; and that he might do it more
effectually he was allowed to have private conference with the judge.
