<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxxxii-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.lxxxii-p1.1"></span>Canon LXXXI.  (Greek lxxxiv.)</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxxxii-p2"></span>Of bishops who appoint heretics or
heathens as their heirs.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxxxii-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.lxxxii-p3.1"></span>Item</span>, it was ordained that if
any bishop should prefer to his Church strangers to blood relationship
with him, or his heretical relatives, or pagans as his heirs, he shall
be anathematized even after his death, and his name shall by no means be
recited among those of the priests of God.  Nor can he be excused if he
die intestate, because being a bishop he was bound not to postpone
making such a disposition of his goods as was befitting his profession.

id="xv.iv.iv.lxxxii-p5.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon LXXXI.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxxxii-p6"></span>Let a bishop be anathema if he make
heretics and heathen his heirs.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxxxii-p7"></span>This is Canon xv. of Carthage,
September, <span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.lxxxii-p7.1"></span>a.d.</span> 401.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxxxii-p9"></span>There were in this age two written
tables kept in every church, whereof one contained the names of all
eminent bishops and clergymen now living, with whom that church held
communion and correspondence; the other, the names of all eminent
bishops, and other men of their own or other churches, now dead.  The
deacon rehearsed all the names, in both tables at the altar, whenever
the Eucharist was celebrated.  These tables were by the Greeks called
<span class="Greek"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.lxxxii-p9.1"></span>Δίπτυχα</span>, and by some English
writers “diptychs.”  See Can. of Peter of Alex., 14.
