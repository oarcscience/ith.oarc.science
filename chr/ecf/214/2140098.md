<span id="viii.iv.iii.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="viii.iv.iii.vii-p1.1"></span>Canon VII.</span>

<span id="viii.iv.iii.vii-p2"></span>A <span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iv.iii.vii-p2.1"></span>presbyter</span> shall not be a guest
at the nuptials of persons contracting a second marriage; for, since the
digamist is worthy of penance, what kind of a presbyter shall he be,
who, by being present at the feast, sanctioned the marriage?

<span id="viii.iv.iii.vii-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iv.iii.vii-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon VII.</span>

<span id="viii.iv.iii.vii-p5"></span>*A presbyter ought not to be
present at the marriage of digamists.  For when that one* <span
id="fr_125"></span>[126](#fn_125) *implores favour, who will deem him
worthy of favour.*

<span id="viii.iv.iii.vii-p7"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iv.iii.vii-p7.1"></span>Hefele.</span>

<span id="viii.iv.iii.vii-p8"></span>The meaning of the canon is as
follows:  “If the digamist, after contracting his second marriage, comes
to the priest to be told the punishment he has to undergo, how stands
the priest himself who for the sake of the feast has become his
accomplice in the offence?”

<span id="viii.iv.iii.vii-p9"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iv.iii.vii-p9.1"></span>Van Espen.</span>

<span id="viii.iv.iii.vii-p10"></span>The present canon again shews that
although the Church never disapproved of, nor reputed second or still
later marriages illicit, nevertheless the Fathers enjoined a penance
upon digamists and those repeating marriage, because by this iteration
they shewed their incontinence.  As he that contracted a second marriage
did not sin properly speaking, and committed no fault worthy of
punishment, therefore whatever was amiss was believed to be paid off by
a lighter penance, and Zonaras supposes that the canons inflicted a
mulct upon digamists, for saith he, “Digamists are not allowed for one
year to receive the Holy Gifts.”

<span id="viii.iv.iii.vii-p11"></span>Zonaras seems to indicate that the
discipline of the canon was not in force in his time, for he says,
“Although this is found in our writings, yet we ourselves have seen the
Patriarch and many Metropolitans present at the feast for the second
nuptials of the Emperor.”

<span id="viii.iv.iii.vii-p6"></span> Bp. Beveridge for “that one”
translates “the digamist.”  The meaning is very obscure at best.
