<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxxix-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.cxxix-p1.1"></span>Canon CXXVIII.  (Greek cxxix.)</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxxix-p2"></span>That those out of communion should
not be allowed to bring accusation.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxxix-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.cxxix-p3.1"></span>It</span> seemed good to all, as it had
been decreed by the former councils, concerning what persons were to be
admitted to bring accusations against clerics; and since it had not been
expressed what persons should not be admitted, therefore we define, that
he cannot properly be admitted to bring an accusation, who had been
already excommunicated, and was still lying under that censure, whether
he that wished to be the accuser were cleric or layman.

id="xv.iv.iv.cxxix-p5.2"></span>Epitome</span> OF <span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.cxxix-p5.3"></span>Canon</span> CXXVIII.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxxix-p6"></span>One excommunicated is not to give
witness.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxxix-p7"></span>The Council of Carthage of 419 had
at its first session on May 25th done thus much.  But when it met again
on the 30th of the same month, it continued the code.  The introduction
in regard to this new session is this introduction.  The Canons then
enacted were original, viz. numbers 128, 129, 130, 131, 132 and 133.
