<span id="xiv.iii.xxxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xiv.iii.xxxvi-p1.1"></span>Canon XXXV.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.xxxvi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.xxxvi-p2.1"></span>It</span> shall be lawful for no
Metropolitan on the death of a bishop of his province to appropriate or
sell the private property of the deceased, or that of the widowed
church:  but these are to be in the custody of the clergy of the diocese
over which he presided until the election of another bishop, unless in
the said church there are no clergymen left.  For then the Metropolitan
shall protect the property without diminution, handing over everything
to the bishop when he is appointed.

id="xiv.iii.xxxvi-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XXXV.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.xxxvi-p5"></span>When the bishop is dead the clergy
shall guard his goods.  If, however, no clergyman remains, the
Metropolitan shall take charge of them until another be ordained.

<span id="xiv.iii.xxxvi-Page_382"></span>Compare Canon xxii. of
Chalcedon. This canon extends the prohibition to Metropolitans as well.

<span id="xiv.iii.xxxvi-p7"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.xxxvi-p7.1"></span>Aristenus.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.xxxvi-p8"></span>Neither the clergy nor metropolitan
after the death of the bishop are allowed to carry off his goods, but
all should be guarded by the clergy themselves, until another bishop is
chosen.  But if by chance no clergyman is left in that church, the
metropolitan is to keep all the possessions undiminished and to return
them to the future bishop.
