<span id="viii.vii.iii.xi-p5"></span>Thou shalt not marry a heretic.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xi-p7"></span>(*Bib. der Kirchenvers*., pt. ii.,
p. 324.)

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xi-p8"></span>“Indiscriminately” means not that
they might be given in marriage to some heretics and not to others; but
that it should not be considered a matter of indifference whether they
were married to heretics or orthodox.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xi-p9"></span>Zonaras and Balsamon, led astray by
the similar canon enacted at Chalcedon (number xiv.), suppose this
restriction only to apply to the children of the clergy, but Van Espen
has shewn that the rule is of general application.  He adds, however,
the following:

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xi-p10"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.vii.iii.xi-p10.1"></span>Van Espen.</span>

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xi-p11"></span>Since by the custom of the Greeks,
ecclesiastics are allowed to have wives, there is no doubt that the
marriage of their children with heretics would be indecent in a very
special degree, although there are many things which go to shew that
marriage with heretics was universally deemed a thing to be avoided by
Catholics, and was rightly forbidden.
