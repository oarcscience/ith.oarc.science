<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxv-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.cxv-p1.1"></span>Canon CXIV.  (Greek cxv.)</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxv-p2"></span>That not only humble but also true is
that voice of the Saints:  “If we say that we have no sin we deceive
ourselves.”

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxv-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.cxv-p3.1"></span>It</span> also seemed good that as St.
John the Apostle says, “If we shall say that we have no sin we deceive
ourselves and the truth is not in us,” whosoever thinks that this should
be so understood as to mean that out of humility, we ought to say that
we have sin, and not because it is really so, let him be anathema.  For
the Apostle goes on to add, “But if we confess our sins, he is faithful
and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all iniquity,”
where it is sufficiently clear that this is said not only of humility
but also truly.  For the Apostle might have said, “If we shall say we
have no sins we shall extoll ourselves, and humility shall have no place
in us;” but when he says, “we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in
us” he sufficiently intimates that he who affirmed that he had no sin
would speak not that which is true but that which is false.

id="xv.iv.iv.cxv-p5.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon CXIV.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxv-p6"></span>Whosoever shall interpret the saying
of the Divine \[i.e. St. John\]:  “If we shall say that we have no sin,
we deceive ourselves” as not being really true but as spoken out of
humility, let him be anathema.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxv-p7"></span>This is Canon vj. of Carthage, <span
