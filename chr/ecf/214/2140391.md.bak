<span id="xiv.iii.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xiv.iii.viii-p1.1"></span>Canon VII.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.viii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.viii-p2.1"></span>Since</span> we have learned that in some
churches deacons hold ecclesiastical offices, and that hereby some of
them with arrogancy and license sit daringly before the presbyters:  we
have determined that a deacon, even if in an office of dignity, that is
to say, in whatever ecclesiastical office he may be, is not to have his
seat before a presbyter, except he is acting as representative of his
own patriarch or metropolitan in another city under another superior,
for then he shall be honoured as filling his place.  But if anyone,
possessed with a tyrannical audacity, shall have dared to do such a
thing, let him be ejected from his peculiar rank and be last of all of
the order in whose list he is in his own church; our Lord admonishing us
that we are not to delight in taking the chief seats, according to the
doctrine which is found in the holy Evangelist Luke, as put forth by our
Lord and God himself.  For to those who were called he taught this
parable:  “When ye are bidden by anyone to a marriage sit not down in
the highest room lest a more honourable man than thou shall have been
bidden by him; and he who bade thee and him come and say to thee:  Give
this man place, and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room.  But
when thou art bidden, sit down in the lowest place, so that when he who
bade thee cometh he may say to thee, Friend go up higher:  then thou
shalt have worship in the presence of them that sit with thee.  For
whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased, and he that humbleth himself
shall be exalted.”  But the same thing also shall be observed in the
remaining sacred orders; seeing that we know that spiritual things are
to be preferred to worldly dignity.

id="xiv.iii.viii-p3.1"></span>Notes.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.viii-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.viii-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon VII.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.viii-p5"></span>A deacon in the execution of his
office, if he shall have occasion to sit in the presence of presbyters,
shall take the lowest place unless he be the representative of the
Patriarch or bishop.

<span id="xiv.iii.viii-p6"></span>Balsamon, Zonaras, and following them
Van Espen point out that this canon is a relaxation of the XVIII. Canon
of Nice which punishes presumptuous deacons not only with loss of rank
in their grade, but also with expulsion from their ministry.

<span id="xiv.iii.viii-p7"></span>Van Espen well remarks that the
Fathers of this synod had in mind not only the pres<span
id="page_369">p. 369</span> <span
id="xiv.iii.viii-Page_369"></span>ervation of the distinction between
deacons and presbyters, but also between those in ecclesiastical orders
and those enjoying secular dignities with regard to ecclesiastical
matters, but who were not to gain there from ecclesiastical precedence. 
This is what is meant by the last clause of the canon.

<span id="xiv.iii.viii-p8"></span>Beveridge gives a list of these
*quasi* ecclesiastical dignitaries as follows:  Magnus Œconomus, Magno
Sacello Præpositus, Magnus Vasorum Custos, Chartophylax, Parvo Sacello
Præpositus, Primus Defensor.
