<span id="xv.iv.iv.xxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xxiv-p1.1"></span>Canon XXIII.  (Greek xxvi.)</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xxiv-p2"></span>That bishops shall not go across
seas.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xxiv-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xxiv-p3.1"></span>Item</span>, That bishops shall not go
beyond seas without consulting the bishop of the primatial see of his
own province:  so that from him they may be able to receive a formed or
commendatory letter.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xxiv-p4"></span><span class="c4"><span

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xxiv-p5"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xxiv-p5.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XXIII.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xxiv-p6"></span>A bishop is not to cross the seas
unless he has received from the Primate of his region a letter
dimissory.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xxiv-p7"></span>This is Canon xxvij. of Hippo, 393.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xxiv-p9"></span>See note on Canons of the Apostles,
10 (13). \[viz.:\]

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xxiv-p10"></span>\[The use of Letters Commendatory
was very early in the Church; St. Paul mentions them [2 Cor.
3.1](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#001)<span
id="xv.iv.iv.xxiv-p10.1"></span>.  And it is not easy to be conceived
how discipline can be restored but by the reviving of this practice.  It
is surely irregular to admit all chance comers to the Communion, who,
for aught we know, may stand excommunicated by their own bishop.  Of the
difference between Commendatory and Pacific and Formal Letters, see Can.
Chalc., 11; Apost., 25, 26; Ant., 6; Sardic., 13\].
