<span id="viii.vii.iii.lxiii-p7"></span>By “the oblation” here is
intended the oblation of the unbloody sacrifice according to the mind of
the Greek interpreters.  Zonaras says:  “The faithful can pray to God
and be intent upon their prayers everywhere, whether in the house, in
the field, or in any place they possess:  but to offer or perform the
oblation must by no means be done except in a church and at an altar.”
