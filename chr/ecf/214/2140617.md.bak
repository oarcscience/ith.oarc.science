<span id="xv.iv.iv.xciv-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xciv-p1.1"></span>Canon XCIII.  (Greek xcvi.)</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xciv-p2"></span>The character of the Commonitory
which the legates received against the Donatists.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xciv-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xciv-p3.1"></span>The</span> Commonitorium for our brothers
Theasius and Evodius, sent as legates from the Council of Carthage to
the most glorious and most religious princes.  When by the help of the
Lord they are come into the presence of the most pious princes, they
shall declare to them with what fulness of confidence, according to the
direction of the council of the year before, the prelates of the
Donatists had been urged by the municipal authority to assemble, in
order that if they really meant their professions, they might by fit
persons chosen from their number, enter into a peaceful conference with
us in Christian meekness, and whatever they held as truth they might not
hesitate to declare it frankly; so that from such conference the
sincerity of the Catholic position, which has been conspicuous for so
long a time, might be perceived even by those who from ignorance or
obstinacy were opposing themselves to it.  But deterred by their want of
confidence they scarcely ventured to reply.  And forsooth, because we
had discharged toward them the offices which become bishops and
peacemakers, and they had no answer to make to the truth, they betook
themselves to unreasonable acts of brute force, and treacherously
oppressed many of the bishops and clergy, to say nothing of the laity. 
And some of the churches they actually invaded, and tried to assault
still others.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xciv-p4"></span>And now, it behoves the gracious
clemency of their Majesties to take measures that the Catholic Church,
which has begotten them as worshippers of Christ in her womb, and has
nourished them with the strong meat of the faith, should by their
forethought, be defended, lest violent men, taking advantage of the
times of religious excitement, should by fear overcome a weak people,
whom by argument they were not able to pervert.  It is well known how
often the vile gatherings (*detestabilis manus*) of the
Circumcelliones <span id="fr_470"></span>[471](#fn_470.md) have been
forbidden by the laws, and also condemned by many decrees of the
Emperors, their majesties most religious predecessors.  Against the
madness of these people it is not unusual nor contrary to the holy
Scriptures to ask for secular \[<span class="Greek"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xciv-p5.1"></span>θείας</span> in the Greek\] protection,
since Paul the Apostle, as is related in the authentic Acts of the
Apostles, warded off a conspiracy of certain lawless men by the help of
the mili<span id="page_489">p. 489</span> <span
id="xv.iv.iv.xciv-Page_489"></span>tary.  Now then we ask that there be
extended to the Catholic Churches, without any dissimulation, the
protection of the ordinum \[i.e. companies of soldiers, stationed\] in
each city, and of the holders of the suburban estates in the various
places. <span id="fr_471"></span>[472](#fn_471.md)   At the same time it
will be necessary to ask that they give commandment that the law, set
forth by their father Theodosius, of pious memory, which imposed a fine
of ten pounds of gold upon both the ordainers and the ordained among
heretics, and which was also directed against proprietors at whose
houses conventicles were held, be confirmed anew; so that it may be
effective with persons of this sort when Catholics, provoked by their
wiles, shall lay complaint against them; so that through fear at least,
they may cease from making schisms and from the wickedness of the
heretics, since they refuse to be cleansed and corrected by the thought
of the eternal punishment.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xciv-p7"></span>Let request be also made that the law
depriving heretics of the power of being able to receive or bequeath by
gift or by will, be straightway renewed by their Piety, so that all
right of giving or receiving may be taken away from those who, blinded
by the madness of obstinacy, are determined to continue in the error of
the Donatists.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xciv-p8"></span>With regard to those who by
considerations of unity and peace are willing to correct themselves, let
permission be granted to them to receive their inheritance, the law
notwithstanding, even though the bequest by gift or inheritance was made
while they were yet living in the error of the heretics; those of course
being excepted, who under the stress of legal proceedings have sought to
enter the Catholic Church; for it may well be supposed, that persons of
this latter sort desired Catholic unity, not so much from fear of the
judgment of heaven, as from the greed of earthly gain.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xciv-p9"></span>For the furtherance of all these
things the help of the Powers (*Potestatum*) of each one of the
provinces is needed.  With regard to other matters, whatever they shall
perceive is for the Church’s interests, this we have resolved that the
legation have full authority to do and to carry into effect.  Moreover
it seemed good to us all, that letters from our assembly should be sent
to the most glorious Emperors and most Excellent Worthinesses, whereby
they may be assured of the agreement of us all that the legates should
be sent by us to their most blessed court.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xciv-p10"></span>Since it is a very slow business for
us all to set our names to these letters, and in order that they may not
be burdened with the signature of each one of us, we desire thee,
brother Aurelius, that thy charity be good enough to sign them in the
name of us all.  And to this they all agreed.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xciv-p11"></span>I, Aurelius, Bishop of the Church of
Carthage have consented to this decree and have subscribed my name.  And
so all the other bishops subscribed.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xciv-p12"></span>Letters ought likewise to be sent to
the judges that, until the lord permit the legates to return to us, they
give protection through the soldiers of the cities, and through the
holders of the farms of the Catholic Church.  It ought also to be added
concerning the dishonest Equitius, which he had shewn by laying claim to
the jus sacerdotum, that he be rejected from the diocese of Hippo
according to the statutes of the Emperors.  Letters ought also to be
sent to the Bishop of the Church of Rome in commendation of the legates,
and to the other Bishops who may be where the Emperor is.  To this they
assented.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xciv-p13"></span>Likewise I, Aurelius, Bishop of the
Church of Carthage, have consented to this decree, and having read it,
have set my name to it.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xciv-p14"></span>And all the other bishops likewise
subscribed.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xciv-p16"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xciv-p16.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XCIII.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xciv-p17"></span>The Emperors who were born in the
true religion and were educated in the faith, ought to stretch forth a
helping hand to the Churches.  For the military band overthrew the dire
conspiracy which was threatening Paul.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xciv-p18"></span><span id="page_490">p. 490</span>
<span id="xv.iv.iv.xciv-Page_490"></span>*Here follows a brief
declaration of what things were decreed in this Synod.*

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xciv-p19"></span>When Stilico a second time and
Anthemius, those illustrious men, were consuls, on the tenth before the
calends of September, at Carthage in the basilica of the second region. 
I have not written out in full the acts of this council <span
id="fr_472"></span>[473](#fn_472.md) because they treat of the necessities
of the time rather than of matters of general interest, but for the
instruction of the studious I have added a brief digest of the same
council. <span id="fr_473"></span>[474](#fn_473.md)

preferred, “wherefore a brief synopsis of what was studiously enacted in
this synod is here set forth.”
