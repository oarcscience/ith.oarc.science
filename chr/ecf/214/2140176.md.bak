<span id="viii.vii.iii.x-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.vii.iii.x-p2.1"></span>The</span> members of the Church are not
allowed to meet in the cemeteries, nor attend the so-called martyries of
any of the heretics, for prayer or service; but such as so do, if they
be communicants, shall be excommunicated for a time; but if they repent
and confess that they have sinned they shall be received.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.x-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.vii.iii.x-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon IX.</span>

<span id="viii.vii.iii.x-p5"></span>Whoso prayeth in the cemeteries and
martyries of heretics is to be excommunicated.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.x-p7"></span>By the word “service” (<span
class="Greek"><span id="viii.vii.iii.x-p7.1"></span>θεραπείας</span>) in
this canon is to be understood the healing of sickness.  The canon
wishes that the faithful should under no pretence betake themselves to
the prayers of heretical pseudo-martyrs nor pay them honour in the hope
of obtaining the healing of sickness or the cure of their various
temptations.  And if any do so, they are to be cut off, that is for a
time forbidden communion (and this refers to the faithful who are only
laymen), but when they have done penance and made confession of their
fault, the canon orders that they are to be received back again.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.x-p9"></span>As canon vi. forbids heretics to
enter the house of God, so this canon forbids the faithful to go to the
cemeteries of heretics, which are called by them “Martyries.”…For in the
days of the persecution, certain of the heretics, calling themselves
Christians, suffered even to death, and hence those who shared their
opinions called them “martyrs.”

<span id="viii.vii.iii.x-p11"></span>As Catholics had their martyrs, so
too had the heretics, and especially the Montanists or Phrygians, who
greatly boasted of them.  Apollinaris writes of these as may be seen in
Eusebius (*H. E.*, Lib. v., cap. xvj.)

<span id="viii.vii.iii.x-p12"></span>The places or cemeteries in which
rested the bodies of those they boasted of as martyrs, they styled
“Martyries” (*martyria*) as similar places among Catholics were wont to
be called by the same name, from the bones of the martyrs that rested
there.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.x-p13"></span>From the Greek text, as also from
Isidore’s version it is clear that this canon refers to all the faithful
generally, and that “the members of the Church” (Lat. *Ecclesiastici*,
the word Dionysius uses) must be taken in this wide signification.
