<span id="x.ix.ii-p1"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="x.ix.ii-p1.1"></span> Excursus on the Word</span> <span
class="Greek"><span id="x.ix.ii-p1.2"></span>Θεοτόκος</span><span
class="c4"><span id="x.ix.ii-p1.3"></span> .</span>

<span id="x.ix.ii-p2"></span>There have been some who have tried to
reduce all the great theological controversies on the Trinity and on the
Incarnation to mere logomachies, and have jeered at those who could
waste their time and energies over such trivialities.  For example, it
has been said that the <span id="page_207">p. 207</span> <span
id="x.ix.ii-Page_207"></span>real difference between Arius and
Athanasius was nothing more nor less than an iota, and that even
Athanasius himself, in his more placid, and therefore presumably more
rational moods, was willing to hold communion with those who differed
from him and who still rejected the homousion.  But however catching and
brilliant such remarks may be, they lack all solid foundation in truth. 
It is perfectly manifest that a person so entirely lacking in
discrimination as not to see the enormous difference between identity
and likeness is not one whose opinion on such a point can be of much
value.  A brilliant historian is not necessarily an accurate historian,
far less need he be a safe guide in matters of theological
definition. <span id="fr_246"></span>[247](#fn_246.md)

<span id="x.ix.ii-p4"></span>A similar attempt to reduce to a logomachy
the difference between the Catholic faith and Nestorianism has been made
by some writers of undoubted learning among Protestants, notably by
Fuchs and Schröckh.  But as in the case of the *homousios* so, too, in
the case of the *theotocos* the word expresses a great, necessary, and
fundamental doctrine of the Catholic faith.  It is not a matter of
words, but of things, and the mind most unskilled in theology cannot
fail to grasp the enormous difference there is between affirming, as
does Nestorianism, that a God indwelt a man with a human personality of
his own distinct from the personality of the indwelling god; and that
God assumed to himself human nature, that is a human body and a human
soul, but without human personality.

<span id="x.ix.ii-p5"></span>(Wm. Bright, *St. Leo on the Incarnation*,
pp. 160, 161.)

<span id="x.ix.ii-p6"></span>It is, then, clear that the question raised
by the wide circulation of the discourses of Nestorius as archbishop of
Constantinople was not verbal, but vital.  Much of his language was
irrelevant, and indicated some confusedness of thought:  much would, of
itself, admit of an orthodox construction; in one of the latest of his
sermons, which Garnier dates on Sunday, December 14, 430, he grants that
“Theotocos” might be used as signifying that “the temple which was
formed in Mary by the Holy Spirit was united to the Godhead;” but it was
impossible not to ask whether by “the temple” he meant the body of
Jesus, or Jesus himself regarded as a human individual existing <span
class="Greek"><span id="x.ix.ii-p6.1"></span>ἰ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="x.ix.ii-p6.2"></span>δίᾳ, ἰδικῶς, ἀνὰ
μέρος</span>—as Cyril represents his theory—and whether by “union” he
meant more than a close alliance, *ejusdem generis*, in the last
analysis, with the relation between God and every saint, or, indeed,
every Christian in true moral fellowship with him—an alliance which
would amount, in Cyril’s phrase, to no more than a “relative union,” and
would reduce the Saviour to a “Theophoros,” the title claimed of old by
one of his chief martyrs.  And the real identity of Nestorius’s view
with that of Theodore \[of Mopsuestia\] was but too plainly exhibited by
such statements as occur in some of the extracts preserved in Cyril’s
treatise *Against Nestorius*—to the effect that Christ was one with the
Word by participation in dignity; that “the man” was partaker of Divine
power, and in that sense not mere man; that he was adored together with
the Word; and that “My Lord and my God” was a doxology to the Father;
and above all, by the words spoken at Ephesus, “I can never allow that a
child of three months old was God.”

<span id="x.ix.ii-p7"></span>It is no part of my duty to defend the
truth of either the Catholic or Nestorian proposition—each has found
many adherents in most ages since it was first started, and probably
what is virtually Nestorianism is to-day far more widely held among
persons deemed to be orthodox than is commonly supposed.  Be this as it
may, Nestorianism is clearly subversive of the whole Catholic Doctrine
of the Incarnation, and therefore the importance of the word <span
class="Greek"><span id="x.ix.ii-p7.1"></span>Θεοτόκος</span> cannot be
exaggerated.

<span id="x.ix.ii-p8"></span><span id="page_208">p. 208</span> <span
id="x.ix.ii-Page_208"></span>I shall treat the word Theotocos under two
heads; (1) Its history (2) its meaning, first however quoting Bp.
Pearson’s words on its Conciliar authority.  (Pearson, Exp. of the
Creed, Art. III., n. 37). “It is plain that the Council of Ephesus which
condemned Nestorius confirmed this title <span class="Greek"><span
id="x.ix.ii-p8.1"></span>Θεοτόκος</span>; I say confirmed it; for it is
evident that it was before used in the Church, by the tumult which arose
at the first denial of it by Anastasius \[Nestorius’s presbyter\]; and
so confirmed it as received before, because they approved the Epistles
of St. Cyril, who proved it by the usage of those Fathers which preceded
him.”

<span id="x.ix.ii-p9"></span>(1)  History of Word <span
class="Greek"><span id="x.ix.ii-p9.1"></span>Θεοτόκος</span>.

<span id="x.ix.ii-p10"></span>It has not been unfrequently assumed that
the word Theotocos was coined to express the peculiar view of the
Incarnation held by St. Cyril.  Such however, is an entire mistake.  It
was an old term of Catholic Theology, and the very word was used by
bishop Alexander in a letter from the synod held at Alexandria in <span
class="sc"><span id="x.ix.ii-p10.1"></span>a.d.</span> 320, <span
id="fr_247"></span>[248](#fn_247.md) to condemn the Arian heresy (more than
a hundred years before the meeting of the Council of Ephesus); “After
this, we receive the doctrine of the resurrection from the dead, of
which Jesus Christ our Lord became the first-fruits; who bore a body in
truth, not in semblance, which he derived from Mary the Mother of God
(<span class="Greek"><span id="x.ix.ii-p11.1"></span>ἐκ τῆς Θεοτόκου
Μαρίας</span>).” <span id="fr_248"></span>[249](#fn_248.md)   The same word
had been used by many church writers among whom may be mentioned St.
Athanasius, who says, “As the flesh was born of Mary, the Mother of God,
so we say that he, the Word, was himself born of Mary” (*Orat. c.
Arian.*, iij., 14, 29, 33; also iv., 32).  See also Eusebius (*Vit.
Const*., iij., 43); St. Cyril of Jerusalem (*Cat*., x., 9); and
especially Origen, who (says Bp. Pearson) “did not only use, but expound
at large the meaning of that title <span class="Greek"><span
id="x.ix.ii-p12.1"></span>Θεοτόκος</span> in his first tome on the
Epistle to the Romans, as Socrates and Liberatus testify.” <span
id="fr_249"></span>[250](#fn_249.md)   (Cf. Origen *in Deut*. xxii., 23;
vol. ij., p. 391. A; in Luc. apud Galland, *Bib. Patr*., vol. xiv.,
append., p. 87, D).  A list is given by Dr. Routh, in his *Reliquiæ
Sacræ*. Vol. ij., p. 215 (1st Ed.), 332 (2d Ed.).

<span id="x.ix.ii-p14"></span>In fact Theodore of Mopsuestia was the
first to object to it, so far as we know, writing as follows:  “Mary
bare Jesus, not the Word, for the Word was and remained omnipresent,
although from the beginning he dwelt in Jesus in a peculiar manner. 
Thus Mary is properly the Mother of Christ (Christotocos) but not the
mother of God (Theotocos).  Only figuratively, *per anaphoram*, can she
be called Theotocos also, because God was in Christ in a remarkable
manner.  Properly she bare a man, in whom the union with the Word was
begun, but was still so little completed, that he was not yet called the
Son of God.”  And in another place he says:  “It is madness to say that
God is born of the Virgin.…Not God, but the temple in which God dwelt,
is born of Mary.” <span id="fr_250"></span>[251](#fn_250.md)   How far
Theodore had departed from the teaching of the Apostolic days may be
seen by the following quotations from St. Ignatius.  “There is one only
physician, of flesh and spirit, generate and ingenerate, God in man,
true Life in death, Son of Mary and of God, first passible and then
impassible, Jesus Christ our Lord.” <span
id="fr_251"></span>[252](#fn_251.md)   Further on in the same epistle he
says:  “For our God, Jesus the Christ, was borne in the womb by Mary
etc.” <span id="fr_252"></span>[253](#fn_252.md)   With the first of these
passages Bp. Lightfoot very aptly compares the following from Melito. 
“Since he was incorporeal, he fashioned a body for himself of our
likeness…he was carried by Mary and clothed by his Father, he trod the
earth and he filled the heavens.” <span
id="fr_253"></span>[254](#fn_253.md)

<span id="x.ix.ii-p19"></span>Theodore was forced by the exigencies of
his position to deny the doctrine of the *communicatio idiomatum* which
had already at that early date come to be well understood, at least so
far as practice is concerned.

<span id="x.ix.ii-p20"></span><span id="page_209">p. 209</span> <span
id="x.ix.ii-Page_209"></span>(Hefele, *Hist. of the Councils*, Vol.
iii., p. 8.)

<span id="x.ix.ii-p21"></span>This doctrine, as is well known is
predicating the same properties of the two natures in Christ, not *in
abstracto* (Godhead and manhood), but *in concreto* (God and man). 
Christ himself had declared in St. [John
iii.](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#000.md)<span id="x.ix.ii-p21.1"></span>,
16:  “God…gave his only begotten Son” (namely, to death), and similarly
St. Peter declared ([Acts 3.15](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#015.md)<span
id="x.ix.ii-p21.2"></span>):  “ye…killed the Prince of Life,” when in
fact the being given up and being killed is a property (<span
class="Greek"><span id="x.ix.ii-p21.3"></span>ἰδίωμα</span> = predicate)
of *man*, not of *God* (the only begotten, the Prince of Life).  In the
same way Clement of Rome, for example, spoke of “the sufferings of God”
(<span class="Greek"><span id="x.ix.ii-p21.4"></span>παθήματα
Θεοῦ</span>) (1 *Ad Cor*. 2), Ignatius of Antioch (*Ad Ephes*., c. 1,
and *Ad Rom*., 6) of an <span class="Greek"><span
id="x.ix.ii-p21.5"></span>αἷμα</span> and <span class="Greek"><span
id="x.ix.ii-p21.6"></span>πάθος Θεοῦ</span>, Tatian of a <span
class="Greek"><span id="x.ix.ii-p21.7"></span>Θεὸς πεπονθὼς</span> (*Ad
Græcos*, c. 13); Barnabas teaches (c. 7) that “the Son of God could not
suffer except on our behalf…and on our behalf he has brought the vessel
of his Spirit as a sacrifice.”  Similarly Irenæus (iii., 16, 6) says,
“The Only-begotten impassible Word (*unigenitus impassibilis*) has
become passible” (*passibilis*); and Athanasius, <span
class="Greek"><span id="x.ix.ii-p21.8"></span>ἐσταυρώμενον εἶναι
Θεὸν</span> (*Ep. ad Epictet*., n. 10, t. j., p. 726. ed. Patav.)

<span id="x.ix.ii-p22"></span>It is, however, to be remarked that the
properties of the one nature were never transferred to the other *nature
in itself*, but always to the *Person* who is at the same time both man
and God.  Human attributes were not ascribed to the Godhead, but to God,
and *vice versâ*.

<span id="x.ix.ii-p23"></span>For a full treatment of the figure of
speech called the *communicatio idiomatum* the reader is referred to the
great works on Theology where it will be found set forth at large, with
its restrictions specified and with examples of its use.  A brief but
interesting note on it will be found in St. John Damascene’s famous
treatise *De Fide Orthodoxa*, Book III., iij. (Migne’s *Pat. Græc*.,
col. 994).

<span id="x.ix.ii-p24"></span>(2)  Meaning of the Word <span
class="Greek"><span id="x.ix.ii-p24.1"></span>Θεοτόκος</span>.

<span id="x.ix.ii-p25"></span>We pass now to the meaning of the word,
having sufficiently traced the history of its use.  Bishop Pearson
says:  “This name was first in use in the Greek Church, who, delighting
in the happy compositions of that language, called the blessed Virgin
Theotocos.  From whence the Latins in imitation styled her *Virginem
Deiparam et Deigenitricem*.” <span id="fr_254"></span>[255](#fn_254.md)  
In the passage to which the words just quoted are a portion of a
footnote, he says:  “Wherefore from these three, a true conception,
nutrition, and parturition, we must acknowledge that the blessed Virgin
was truly and properly the Mother of our Saviour.  And so is she
frequently styled the Mother of Jesus in the language of the
Evangelists, and by Elizabeth particularly the ‘Mother of her Lord,’ as
also by the general consent of the Church (because he which was so born
of her was God,) the *Deipara*; which being a compound title begun in
the Greek Church, was resolved into its parts by the Latins and so the
Virgin was plainly named the Mother of God.”

<span id="x.ix.ii-p27"></span>Pearson is mistaken in supposing that the
resolution of the compound Theotocos into <span class="Greek"><span
id="x.ix.ii-p27.1"></span>μήτηρ τοῦ Θεοῦ</span> was unknown to the early
Greek writers.  Dionysius expressly calls Mary <span class="Greek"><span
id="x.ix.ii-p27.2"></span>ἡ μήτηρ τοῦ Θεοῦ μου</span> (*Contr. Paul.
Samos*., Quæst. viij.); and among the Latins *Mater Dei* and *Dei
Genetrix* were (as Pearson himself confesses in note 37) used before the
time of St. Leo I.  It is not an open question whether *Mater Dei*, *Dei
Genetrix*, *Deipara*, <span class="Greek"><span
id="x.ix.ii-p27.3"></span>μήτηρ τοῦ Θεοῦ</span> are proper equivalents
for <span class="Greek"><span
id="x.ix.ii-p27.4"></span>Θεοτόκος</span>.  This point has been settled
by the unvarying use of the whole Church of God throughout all the ages
from that day to this, but there is, or at least some persons have
thought that there was, some question as to how Theotocos should be
translated into English.

<span id="x.ix.ii-p28"></span>Throughout this volume I have translated
it “Mother of God,” and I propose giving my <span id="page_210">p.
210</span> <span id="x.ix.ii-Page_210"></span>reasons for considering
this the only accurate translation of the word, both from a
lexico-graphical and from a theological point of view.

<span id="x.ix.ii-p29"></span>(a)  It is evident that the word is a
composite formed of <span class="Greek"><span
id="x.ix.ii-p29.1"></span>Θεός</span> = God, and <span
class="Greek"><span id="x.ix.ii-p29.2"></span>τίκτειν</span> = to be the
mother of a child.  Now I have translated the verbal part “to be the
mother of a child” because “to bear” in English does not necessarily
carry the full meaning of the Greek word, which (as Bp. Pearson has well
remarked in the passage cited above) includes “conception, nutrition,
and parturition.”  It has been suggested that “God-bearer” is an exact
translation.  To this I object, that in the first place it is not
English; and in the second that it would be an equally and, to my mind,
more accurate translation of <span class="Greek"><span
id="x.ix.ii-p29.3"></span>Θεοφόρος</span> than of <span
class="Greek"><span id="x.ix.ii-p29.4"></span>Θεοτόκος</span>.

<span id="x.ix.ii-p30"></span>Another suggestion is that it be rendered
“the bringer forth of God.”  Again I object that, from a rhetorical
standpoint, the expression is very open to criticism; and from a
lexicographical point of view it is entirely inadequate, for while
indeed the parturition does necessarily involve in the course of nature
the previous conception and nutrition, it certainly does not express it.

<span id="x.ix.ii-p31"></span>Now the word Mother does necessarily
express all three of these when used in relation to her child.  The
reader will remember that the question I am discussing is not whether
Mary can properly be called the Mother of God; this Nestorius denied and
many in ancient and modern times have been found to agree with him.  The
question I am considering is what the Greek word Theotocos means in
English.  I do not think anyone would hesitate to translate Nestorius’s
*Christotocos* by “Mother of Christ” and surely the expressions are
identical from a lexicographical point of view.

<span id="x.ix.ii-p32"></span>Liddell and Scott in their *Lexicon*
insert the word <span class="Greek"><span
id="x.ix.ii-p32.1"></span>θεοτόκος</span> as an adjective and translate
“bearing God” and add:  “especially <span class="Greek"><span
id="x.ix.ii-p32.2"></span>ἡ</span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="x.ix.ii-p32.3"></span>Θεοτόκος</span>, Mother of God, of the Virgin,
Eccl.”

<span id="x.ix.ii-p33"></span>(b)  It only remains to consider whether
there is from a theological point of view any objection to the
translation, “Mother of God.”  It is true that some persons have thought
that such a rendering implied that the Godhead has its origin in Mary,
but this was the very objection which Nestorius and his followers urged
against the word Theotocos, and this being the case, it constitutes a
strong argument in favour of the accuracy of the rendering.  Of course
the answer to the objection in each case is the same, it is not of the
Godhead that Mary is the Mother, but of the Incarnate Son, who is God. 
“Mother” expresses exactly the relation to the incarnate Son which St.
Cyril, the Council of Ephesus, and all succeeding, not to say also
preceding, ages of Catholics, rightly or wrongly, ascribe to Mary.  All
that every child derives from its Mother that God the Son derived from
Mary, and this without the co-operation of any man, but by the direct
operation of the Holy Ghost, so that in a fuller, truer, and more
perfect sense, Mary is the Mother of God the Son in his incarnation,
than any other earthly mother is of her son.

<span id="x.ix.ii-p34"></span>I therefore consider it certain that no
scholar who can and will divest himself of theological bias, can doubt
that “Mother of God” is the most accurate translation of the term
Theotocos.
