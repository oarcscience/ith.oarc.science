<span id="xv.iv.iv.xxx-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xxx-p1.1"></span>Canon XXIX.  (Greek xxxii.)</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xxx-p2"></span>*If anyone who is excommunicated shall
receive communion before his cause is heard he brings damnation on
himself.* <span id="fr_431"></span>[432](#fn_431)

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xxx-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xxx-p4.1"></span>Likewise</span> it pleased the whole
Council that he who shall have been excommunicated for any neglect,
whether he be bishop, or any other cleric, and shall have presumed while
still under sentence, and his cause not yet heard, to receive communion,
he shall be considered by so doing to have given sentence against
himself.

id="xv.iv.iv.xxx-p6.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XXIX.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xxx-p7"></span>One excommunicate who shall
communicate before absolution sentences himself.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xxx-p8"></span>This canon seems to be founded upon
Canon iv. of Antioch.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xxx-p10"></span>See *Can. Ap*., 21 (29), *Antioch*,
4.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xxx-p11"></span>By this canon the criminous bishop is
supposed to be excommunicated before he comes to have his cause heard by
a Synod, or by 12 neighbouring bishops:  and it is therefore most
rational to believe that he was thus censured by his Primate.  See *Can.
Afr*., 12.
