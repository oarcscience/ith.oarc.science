id="xv.vi.iii-p1.1"></span>The Synod held at Carthage over which
presided the Great and Holy Martyr Cyprian, Bishop of Carthage.</span>

<span id="xv.vi.iii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.vi.iii-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> 257.

<span id="xv.vi.iii-p3"></span>(*Found in Beveridge*, Synodicon, *Tom.
I., p. 365, and in Labbe and Cossart*, Concilia, *Tom. I., col. 786*.)

<span id="xv.vi.iii-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.vi.iii-p4.1"></span>When</span> very many bishops were met
together at Carthage on the Calends of September from the province of
Africa, Numidia and Mauritania, with the presbyters and deacons (the
greater part of the people being likewise present) and when the holy
letters of Jubaianus to Cyprian had been read, and Cyprian’s answers to
Jubaianus, concerning heretical baptisms, as well as what the same
Jubaianus afterwards wrote to Cyprian,

<span id="xv.vi.iii-p5"></span>Cyprian said:  Ye have heard, my dearly
beloved colleagues, what our fellow bishop Jubaianus has written to me,
taking counsel of my littleness concerning the illicit and profane
baptisms of heretics, and the answer which I made him; being of the same
opinion as we have been on former occasions, that heretics coming to the
Church should be baptized and sanctified with the Church’s baptism. 
Moreover there has been read to you also the other letter of Jubaianus,
in which answering for his sincere and pious devotion to our letter, not
only he agrees therewith but offered thanks that he has been so
instructed by it.  It only remains therefore that we, each one of us,
one by one, say what our mind is in this matter, without condemning any
one or removing any one from the right of communion who does not agree
with us.

<span id="xv.vi.iii-p6"></span>For no one \[of us <span
id="fr_503"></span>[504](#fn_503.md) \] has set himself up \[to be\] bishop
\[of bishops\], <span id="fr_504"></span>[505](#fn_504.md) or attempted
with tyrannical dread to force his colleagues to obedience to him, since
every bishop has, for the license of liberty and power, his own will,
and as he cannot be judged by another, so neither can he judge another. 
But we await the judgment of our universal Lord, our Lord Jesus Christ,
who one and alone hath the power, both of advancing us in the governance
of his Church, and of judging of our actions \[in that position\].

<span id="xv.vi.iii-p9"></span>\[*The bishops then one by one declared
against heretical baptism*. <span id="fr_505"></span>[506](#fn_505.md)
*Last of all* (col. 796)\]:

<span id="xv.vi.iii-p11"></span>Cyprian, the Confessor and Martyr of
Carthage, said:  The letter which was written to Jubaianus, my
colleague, most fully set forth my opinion, that heretics who, according
to the evangelical and apostolic witness, are called adversaries of
Christ’s and anti-Christs, when they come to the Church, should be
baptized with the one (*unico*) baptism of the Church, that they may
become instead of adversaries friends, and Christians instead of
Antichrists.

<span id="xv.vi.iii-p12"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xv.vi.iii-p12.1"></span>Notes.</span>

<span id="xv.vi.iii-p13"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.vi.iii-p13.1"></span>Zonaras.</span>

<span id="xv.vi.iii-p14"></span>These are the opinions therefore of the
fathers, which assembled in council with the great Cyprian:  but they do
not apply to all heretics nor to all schismatics.  For the Second
Ecumenical Council, as we have just said \[i.e. in the Preface he has
placed to the acts of the synod.  *Vide* L. and C., *Conc*., Tom. i.,
col. 801\] makes an exception of some heretics, and give its sanction to
their reception without baptism, only requiring their anointing with the
holy chrism, and then anathematizing at the same time their own and all
heresies.

<span id="xv.vi.iii-p15"></span>Balsamon does not print the acts of the
Council at all but only the letter of St. Cyprian (Labbe and Cossart,
*Concilia*, Tom. I., col. 799.)  I have not thought it worth while to
place here the remarks of the eighty-six bishops, <span
class="Greek"><span id="xv.vi.iii-p15.1"></span>ὡ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="xv.vi.iii-p15.2"></span>ς</span> <span
class="Greek"><span id="xv.vi.iii-p15.3"></span>μὴ ἀναγκαῖαι</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="xv.vi.iii-p15.4"></span>,</span> <span
class="Greek"><span id="xv.vi.iii-p15.5"></span>οἷα μὴδε
ἐνεργοῦσαι</span>, to quote Zonaras’s words.

<span id="xv.vi.iii-p16"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.vi.iii-p16.1"></span>Binius.</span>

<span id="xv.vi.iii-p17"></span>The allusion here is to the decree of
Stephen, who was wont, according to the custom of his elders, to be
styled “Bishop of bishops,” and because he had acrimoniously threatened
excommunication to all not agreeing with him.

<span id="xv.vi.iii-p18"></span><span id="page_518">p. 518</span> <span
id="xv.vi.iii-Page_518"></span>On the disputed historical fact as to
whether St. Cyprian died in or out of the communion of the See of Rome
the reader will do well to consult Puller, *The Primitive Saints and the
See of Rome*.

<span id="xv.vi.iii-p19"></span>I place here St. Cyprian’s Seventieth
Epistle in the Oxford Translation (*Epistle of St. Cyprian*, pp. 232 *et
seqq*.).  This letter is addressed to Januarius, Satterninus, etc., and
is headed in Beveridge’s *Synodicon* “Canon I.”
