id="xv.iv.iv.lxxviii-p1.1"></span>Canon LXXVII.  (Greek lxxx.)</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxxviii-p2"></span>Of Cresconius.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxxviii-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.lxxviii-p3.1"></span>Concerning</span> Cresconius of Villa
Regis this seemed good to all, that the Primate of Numidia should be
informed on this matter so that he should by his letters summon the
aforementioned Cresconius in order that at the next plenary Council of
Africa he should not put off making an appearance.  But if he contemns
the summons and does not come, let him recognize the fact that sentence
should be pronounced against him.

id="xv.iv.iv.lxxviii-p5.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon
LXXVII.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxxviii-p6"></span>Unless Cresconius who has been
summoned by letter to the Synod, shall appear, let him know that he will
have sentence given against him.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxxviii-p7"></span>This canon was probably formerly
an appendix (so Hefele thinks) to Canon xj., of the Synod of Carthage of
September 13, 401.
