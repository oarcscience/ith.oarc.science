<p class="c18"><a name="xvii.iv-p55"></A>If a bishop, presbyter, or deacon be found guilty of fornication, perjury, or theft, let him be deposed, but let him not be excommunicated; for the Scripture says, &#8220;thou shalt not punish a man twice for the same offence.&#8221;&#160; In like manner the other clergy shall be subject to the same proceeding.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_570"></A><A HREF="#fn_570"><FONT SIZE="1">571</FONT></A>

<p class="c18"><a name="xvii.iv-p60"></A>If a bishop, presbyter, or deacon shall strike any of the faithful who have sinned, or of the unbelievers who have done wrong, with the intention of frightening them, we command that he be deposed.&#160; For our Lord has by no means taught us to do so, but, on the contrary, when he was smitten he smote not again, when he was reviled he reviled not again, when he suffered he threatened not.</p> 
<p class="c34"><a name="xvii.iv-p61"></A><span class="c4"><a name="xvii.iv-p61.1"></A>Canon XXVIII.&#160; (XXIX.)</span></p>

<p class="c18"><a name="xvii.iv-p64"></A>If any bishop, presbyter, or deacon, shall obtain possession of that dignity by money, let both him and the person who ordained him be deposed, and also altogether cut off from all communion, as Simon Magus was by me Peter.</p> 
<p class="c34"><a name="xvii.iv-p65"></A><span class="c4"><a name="xvii.iv-p65.1"></A>Canon XXX.&#160; (XXXI.)</span></p>

<p class="c18"><a name="xvii.iv-p68"></A>If any presbyter, despising his own bishop, shall collect a separate congregation, and erect another altar, not having any grounds for condemning the bishop with regard to religion or justice, let him be deposed for his ambition; for he is a tyrant; in like manner also the rest of the clergy, and as many as join him; and let laymen be excommunicated.&#160; Let this, however, be done after a first, second, and third admonition from the bishop.</p> 
<p class="c34"><a name="xvii.iv-p69"></A><span class="c4"><a name="xvii.iv-p69.1"></A>Canon XXXII.&#160; (XXXIII.)</span></p>

<p class="c18"><a name="xvii.iv-p72"></A>No foreign bishop, presbyter, or deacon, may be received without commendatory letters; and when they are produced let the persons be examined; and if they be preachers of godliness, let them be received.&#160; Otherwise, although you supply them with what they need, you must not receive them into communion, for many things are done surreptitiously.</p> 
<p class="c34"><a name="xvii.iv-p73"></A><span class="c4"><a name="xvii.iv-p73.1"></A>Canon XXXIV.&#160; (XXXV.)</span></p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="xvii.iv-p74"></A>The bishops of every nation must acknowledge him who is first among them and account him as their head, and do nothing of consequence without his consent; but each may do those things only which concern his own parish, and the country places which belong to it.&#160; But neither let him (who is the first) do anything without the consent of all; for so there will be unanimity, and God will be glorified through the Lord in the Holy Spirit.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_571"></A><A HREF="#fn_571"><FONT SIZE="1">572</FONT></A>
</p> 
<p class="c34"><a name="xvii.iv-p76"></A><span class="c4"><a name="xvii.iv-p76.1"></A>Canon XXXV.&#160; (XXXVI.)</span></p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="xvii.iv-p77"></A>Let not a bishop dare to ordain beyond his own limits, in cities and places not subject to him.&#160; But if he be convicted of doing so, without the consent of those persons who have authority over such cities and places, let him be deposed, and those also whom he has ordained.</p> 
<p class="c34"><a name="xvii.iv-p78"></A><span class="c4"><a name="xvii.iv-p78.1"></A>Canon XXXVI.&#160; (XXXVII.)</span></p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="xvii.iv-p79"></A>If any person, having been ordained bishop, does not undertake the ministry, and the care of the people committed to him, let him be excommunicated until he does undertake it.&#160; In like manner a presbyter or deacon.&#160; But if he has gone and has not been received, not of his own will but from the perverseness of the people, let him continue bishop; and let the clergy of the city be excommunicated, because they have not corrected the disobedient people.</p> 
<p class="c34"><a name="xvii.iv-p80"></A><span class="c4"><a name="xvii.iv-p80.1"></A>Canon XXXVII.&#160; (XXXVIII.)</span></p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="xvii.iv-p81"></A>Let there be a meeting of the bishops twice a year, and let them examine amongst themselves the decrees concerning religion and settle the ecclesiastical controversies which may have occurred.&#160; One meeting to be held in the fourth week of Pentecost [i.e., the fourth week after Easter], and the other on the 12th day of the month Hyperberet&aelig;us [i.e., October].</p> 
<p class="c34"><a name="xvii.iv-p82"></A><span class="c4"><a name="xvii.iv-p82.1"></A>Canon XXXVIII.&#160; (XXXIX.)</span></p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="xvii.iv-p83"></A>Let the bishop have the care of all the goods of the Church, and let him administer them as under the inspection of God.&#160; But he must not alienate any of them or give the things which belong to God to his own relations.&#160; If they be poor let him relieve them as poor; but let him not, under that pretence, sell the goods of the Church.</p> 
<p class="c34"><a name="xvii.iv-p84"></A><span class="c4"><a name="xvii.iv-p84.1"></A>Canon XXXIX.&#160; (XL.)</span></p> 
<p class="c54"><a name="xvii.iv-p85"></A>Let not the presbyters or deacons do anything without the sanction of the bishop; for he it is who is intrusted with the people of the Lord, and of whom will be required the account of their souls.</p> 
<p class="c34"><a name="xvii.iv-p86"></A><span class="c4"><a name="xvii.iv-p86.1"></A>Canon XL.&#160; (XL. Continued.)</span></p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="xvii.iv-p87"></A>Let the private goods of the bishop, if he have any such, and those of the Lord, be clearly distinguished, that the bishop may have the power of leaving his own goods, when he dies, to whom he will, and how he will, and that the bishop&#146;s own property may not be lost under pretence of its being the property of the Church:&#160; for it may be that he has a wife, or children, or relations, or servants; and it is just before God and man, that neither should the Church suffer any loss through ignorance of the bishop&#146;s own property, nor the bishop or his relations be injured under pretext of the Church:&#160; nor that those who belong to him should be involved in contests, and cast reproaches upon his death.</p> 
<p class="c34"><a name="xvii.iv-p88"></A><span class="c4"><a name="xvii.iv-p88.1"></A>Canon XLI.</span></p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="xvii.iv-p89"></A>We ordain that the bishop have authority over the goods of the Church:&#160; for if he is to be intrusted with the precious souls of men, much more are temporal possessions to be intrusted to him.&#160; He is therefore to administer them all of his own authority, and supply those who need, through the presbyters and deacons, in the fear of God, and with all reverence.&#160; He may also, if need be, take what is required for his own necessary wants, and for the brethren to whom he has to show hospitality, so that he may not be in any want.&#160; For the law of God has ordained, that they who wait at the altar should be nour<A NAME="page_597"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 597</FONT></A> <a name="xvii.iv-Page_597"></A>ished of the altar.&#160; Neither does any soldier bear arms against an enemy at his own cost.</p>

<p class="c18"><a name="xvii.iv-p101"></A>Let a bishop or presbyter who shall baptize again one who has rightly received baptism, or who shall not baptize one who has been polluted by the ungodly, be deposed, as despising the cross and death of the Lord, and not making a distinction between the true priests and the false.</p>

<p class="c18"><a name="xvii.iv-p107"></A>If any bishop or presbyter does not perform the one initiation with three immersions, but with giving one immersion only, into the death of the Lord, let him be deposed.&#160; For the Lord said not, Baptize into my death, but, &#8220;Go, make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.&#8221;</p>
