<p class="c31"><a name="xvi.xvi-p2"></A>(J. B. Bury, Appendix 14 to Vol. V. of his edition of Gibbon&#146;s <i>Rome</i>. 1898.)</p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="xvi.xvi-p3"></A>It is incorrect to say that &#8220;the two epistles of Gregory II. have been preserved in the Acts of the Nicene Council&#8221; [as Gibbon does].&#160; In modern collections of the Acts of Ecclesiastical Councils, they have been printed at the end of the Acts of the Second Nicene Council.&#160; But they first came to light at the end of the <span class="sc"><a name="xvi.xvi-p3.1"></A>XVI</span>th. century and were printed for the first time in the <i>Annales Ecclesiastici</i> of Baronius, who had obtained them from Fronton le Duc.&#160; This scholar had copied the text from a Greek <span class="sc"><a name="xvi.xvi-p3.2"></A>ms.</span> at Rheims.&#160; Since then other <span class="sc"><a name="xvi.xvi-p3.3"></A>mss.</span> have been found, the earliest belonging to the <span class="sc"><a name="xvi.xvi-p3.4"></A>XI</span>th., if not the Xth century.</p> 
<p class="c19"><a name="xvi.xvi-p4"></A>In another case we should say that the external evidence for the genuineness of the epistles was good.&#160; We know on the authority of Theophanes that Gregory wrote one or more letters to Leo (<span class="Greek"><a name="xvi.xvi-p4.1"></A>&#7952;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#955;&#8052;&#957; &#948;&#959;&#947;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8053;&#957;</span> , <i>sub</i> <span class="sc"><a name="xvi.xvi-p4.2"></A>a. m</span>. 6172, <span class="Greek"><a name="xvi.xvi-p4.3"></A>&#959;&#953; &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#955;&#8182;&#957;</span>, <i>sub</i> <span class="sc"><a name="xvi.xvi-p4.4"></A>a. m</span>. 6221); and we should have no external reasons to suspect copies dating from about 300 years later.&#160; But the omission of these letters in the Acts of the Nicene Council, though they are stated to have been read at the council, introduces a shadow of suspicion.&#160; If they were preserved, how comes it that they were not preserved in the Acts of the Council, like the letter of Gregory to the Patriarch Germanus?&#160; There is no trace anywhere of the Latin originals.</p> 
<p class="c19"><a name="xvi.xvi-p5"></A>Turning to the contents, we find enough to convert suspicion into a practical certainty that the documents are forgeries.&#160; This is the opinion of M. l&#146;abb&eacute; Duchesne (the editor of the <i>Liber Pontificalis</i>), M. L. Gu&eacute;rard (<i>M&eacute;langes d&#146;Arch&eacute;ologie et d&#146;Histoire</i>, p. 44 <i>sqq</i>., 1890); Mr. Hodgkin (<i>Italy and her Invaders</i>, Vol. vi., p. 501 <i>sqq</i>.).&#160; A false date (the beginning of Leo&#146;s reign is placed in the <span class="sc"><a name="xvi.xvi-p5.1"></A>XIV</span>th. instead of the <span class="sc"><a name="xvi.xvi-p5.2"></A>XV</span>th. indiction), and the false implication that the Imperial territory of the &#8220;Ducatus Rom&aelig;&#8221; terminated at twenty-four stadia, or three miles, from Rome, point to an author who was neither a contemporary of Leo nor a resident in Rome.&#160; But the insolent tone of the letters is enough to condemn them.&#160; Gregory II. would never have addressed to his sovereign the crude abuse with which these documents teem.&#160; Another objection (which I have never seen noticed) is that in the First Letter the famous image of Christ which was pulled down by Leo, is stated to have been in the &#8220;Chalkoprateia&#8221; (bronzesmith&#146;s quarter), whereas, according to the trustworthy sources, it was above the Chalk&acirc; gate of the Palace.</p> 
<p class="c19"><a name="xvi.xvi-p6"></A>Rejecting the letters on these grounds&#8212;which are supported by a number of smaller points&#8212;we get rid of the difficulty about a Lombard siege of Ravenna before <span class="sc"><a name="xvi.xvi-p6.1"></A>a.d.</span> 727:&#160; a siege which is not mentioned elsewhere and was doubtless created by the confused knowledge of the fabricator.</p>
