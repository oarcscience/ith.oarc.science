<span id="x.ix.vii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="x.ix.vii-p2.1"></span>If</span> anyone shall dare say that the Word
of God the Father is the God of Christ or the Lord of Christ, and shall
not rather confess him as at the same time both God and Man, since
according to the Scriptures, “The Word was made flesh”:  let him be
anathema.

<span id="x.ix.vii-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="x.ix.vii-p4.1"></span>Nestorius.</span>

<span id="x.ix.vii-p5"></span>VI.

<span id="x.ix.vii-p6"></span>If anyone, after the Incarnation calls
another than Christ the Word, and ventures to say that the form of a
servant is equally with the Word of God, without beginning and
uncreated, and not rather that it is made by him as its natural Lord and
Creator and God, and that he has promised to raise it again in the
words:  “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will build it up
again”; let him be anathema.

<span id="x.ix.vii-p7"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="x.ix.vii-p7.1"></span>Hefele.</span>

<span id="x.ix.vii-p8"></span>This \[statement of Nestorius’s that any
should call “another than Christ the Word”\] has no reference to Cyril;
but is a hyper-Nestorianism, which Nestorius here rejects.  This \[that
“the form of a servant is without beginning and uncreated”\] was
asserted by some Apollinarists; and Nestorius accused St. Cyril of
Apollinarianism.

<span id="x.ix.vii-p9"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="x.ix.vii-p9.1"></span>Petavius.</span>

<span id="x.ix.vii-p10"></span>As Nestorius believed that in Christ
there were two distinct entities (*re ipsa duos*) that is to say two
persons joined together; it was natural that he should hold that the
Word was the God and Lord of the other, that is of the man.  Cyril
contradicts this, and since he taught that there was, not two, but one
of two natures, that is one person or suppositum, therefore he denied
that the Word was the God or Lord of the man; since no one should be
called the Lord of himself.

<span id="x.ix.vii-p11"></span>Theodoret in his answer shuffles as
usual, and points out that Christ is styled a servant by the Prophet
Isaiah, because of the form of a servant which he had received.  But to
this Cyril answers; that although Christ, inasmuch as he was man, is
called the servant of the Father, as of a person distinct from himself;
yet he denies that the same person can be his own lord or servant, lest
a separation of the person be introduced.
