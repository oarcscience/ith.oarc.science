<span id="xv.iv.iv.c-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.c-p1.1"></span>Canon XCIX.  (Greek ciii.)</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.c-p2"></span>Of people or dioceses returned from the
Donatists.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.c-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.c-p3.1"></span>Such</span> communities as have returned
from the Donatists and have had bishops, without doubt may continue to
have them even without any action of the councils, but such a community
as had a bishop and when he dies wish no longer to have a bishop of
their own, but to belong to the diocese of some other bishop, this is
not to be denied them.  Also such bishops as before the promulgation of
the imperial law concerning unity as brought back their people to the
Catholic Church, they ought to be allowed still to rule them:  but from
the time of that law of unity, all the Churches, and their dioceses, and
if perchance there be any instruments of the Church or things pertaining
to its rights should belong to the Catholic bishops of those places to
whom the places pertained while under the heretics, whether they be
converted to the Catholic Church or remain unconverted heretics. 
Whoever after this law shall make any such usurpation, shall restore as
is meet the usurped possessions.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.c-p5"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.c-p5.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XCIX.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.c-p6"></span>Whoever are converted from the Donatists
may retain their own bishops, although they had them without the consent
of the synod; and when the bishop is dead, if they do not wish another
to be substituted in his room, but desire to place themselves under some
other bishop, they shall be allowed to do so.  And such bishops as
before the union have brought back the people they ruled, let them still
rule them.  After the imperial Edict on Unity every church must defend
its own rights.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.c-p7"></span>This canon is Canon v. of Carthage,
<span class="sc"><span id="xv.iv.iv.c-p7.1"></span>a.d.</span> 407.

For uniting all in the catholic faith, and ejecting the donatistical
bishops.
