id="xv.iv.iv.cxxii-p1.1"></span>Canon CXXI.  (Greek cxxii.)</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxxii-p2"></span>Of those who neglect the peoples
belonging to them.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxxii-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.cxxii-p3.1"></span>Item</span>, it seemed good that whoever
neglect to bring the places belonging to their see into Catholic unity
should be admonished by the neighbouring diligent bishops, that they
delay no longer to do this; but if within six months from the day of the
convention they do nothing, let them pertain to him who can win them: 
but with this proviso however, that if he to whom it seemed they
naturally belonged can prove that this neglect was intentional and more
efficacious in winning them than the greater apparent diligence of
others; when the episcopal judges shall be convinced that this is the
case, they shall restore the places to his see.  If the bishops between
whom the cause lies are of different provinces, let the Primate in whose
province the place is situated about which there is the dispute, appoint
judges; but if by mutual consent they have chosen as judges the
neighbouring bishops, let one or three be chosen:  so that if they
choose three they may follow the sentence of all or of two.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxxii-p6"></span>If any neglect what belongs to their
jurisdiction, let them be admonished; and if they shall do nothing
within a six month, let them be adjudged to him who can win them.  But
if they have committed the neglect out of policy so as not to irritate
the heretics, and this shall appear to have been the case, their sees
shall be restored to them, by the judgment of the bishops either
appointed or elected.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxxii-p7"></span>This is Canon xiij. of Carthage,
