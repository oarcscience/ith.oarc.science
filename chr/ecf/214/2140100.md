<span id="viii.iv.iii.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="viii.iv.iii.ix-p1.1"></span>Canon IX.</span>

<span id="viii.iv.iii.ix-p2"></span>A <span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iv.iii.ix-p2.1"></span>presbyter</span> who has been promoted
after having committed carnal sin, and who shall confess that he had
sinned before his ordination, shall not make the oblation, though he may
remain in his other functions on account of his zeal in other respects;
for the majority have affirmed that ordination blots out other kinds of
sins.  But if he do not confess and cannot be openly convicted, the
decision shall depend upon himself.

<span id="viii.iv.iii.ix-p3"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="viii.iv.iii.ix-p3.1"></span>Notes.</span>

<span id="viii.iv.iii.ix-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iv.iii.ix-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon IX.</span>

<span id="viii.iv.iii.ix-p5"></span>*If a presbyter confess that he has
sinned,* <span id="fr_126"></span>[127](#fn_126.md) *let him abstain from
the oblation, and from it only.  For certain sins orders remit.  If he
neither confess nor is convicted, let him have power over himself.*

<span id="viii.iv.iii.ix-p7"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iv.iii.ix-p7.1"></span>Van Espen.</span>

<span id="viii.iv.iii.ix-p8"></span>Therefore if he who before his
ordination had committed a sin of the flesh with a woman, confess it
after ordination, when he is already a priest, he cannot perform the
priestly office, he can neither offer nor consecrate the oblations, even
though after his ordination he has preserved uprightness of living and
been careful to exercise virtue; as the words “zeal in other respects”
(“studious of good”) Zonaras rightly interprets.

<span id="viii.iv.iii.ix-p9"></span>And since here the consideration is
of a sin committed before ordination, and also concerning a presbyter
who after his ordination was of spotless life, and careful to exercise
virtue, the Fathers rightly wished that he should not, against his will,
be deposed from the priestly office.

<span id="viii.iv.iii.ix-p10"></span>It is certainly curious that this
canon speaks of ordination as in the opinion of most persons taking away
all sins except consummated carnal offences.  And it will be noted that
the <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.iv.iii.ix-p10.1"></span>ἀφιέναι</span> must mean more than that
they are forgiven by ordination, for they had been forgiven long ago by
God upon true contrition, but that they were made to be non-existent, as
if they had never been, so that they were no hinderance to the exercise
of the spiritual office.  I offer no explanation of the difficulty and
only venture to doubt the satisfactory character of any of the
explanations given by the commentators.  Moreover it is hard to grasp
the logical connexion of the clauses, and what this “blotting out” of
<span class="Greek"><span id="viii.iv.iii.ix-p10.2"></span>τὰ
λοιπὰ</span> has to do with the matter I entirely fail to see.  The
<span class="Greek"><span id="viii.iv.iii.ix-p10.3"></span>καὶ</span>
after <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.iv.iii.ix-p10.4"></span>πολλοὶ</span> may possibly suggest that
something has dropped out.

<span id="viii.iv.iii.ix-p11"></span>This canon and the following are
together in the *Corpus Juris Canonici*, Gratian’s *Decretum*, Pars II.,
Causa xv., Quæst. viii., c. i.
