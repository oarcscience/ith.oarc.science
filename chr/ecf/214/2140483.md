<span id="xiv.iii.c-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.c-p2.1"></span>We</span> have further learned that, in the
regions of the Armenians, certain persons boil joints of meat within the
sanctuary and offer portions to the priests, distributing it after the
Jewish fashion.  Wherefore, that we may keep the church undefiled, we
decree that it is not lawful for any priest to seize the separate
portions of flesh meat from those who offer them, but they are to be
content with what he that offers pleases to give them; and further we
decree that such offering be made outside the church.  And if any one
does not thus, let him be cut off.

<span id="xiv.iii.c-p5"></span>There are some who like the Jews cook
meat in the holy places.  Whoever permits this, or receives aught from
them, is not fit to be priest.  But if any one should of his own free
choice offer it, then he might receive as much as the offerer chose to
give him, provided the offer were made outside the church.

<span id="xiv.iii.c-p6"></span>A similar Judaizing superstitious custom
was also found in the West, of which Walafrid Strabo gives an account in
the IX. Century (*De Rebus Ecclesiasticis*, cap. xviii.).
