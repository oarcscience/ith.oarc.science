<span id="x.ix.viii-p6"></span>If any one says that the man who was
formed of the Virgin is the Only-begotten, who was born from the bosom
of the Father, before the morning star was ([Psa.

and does not rather confess that he has obtained the desig<span
id="page_214">p. 214</span> <span id="x.ix.viii-Page_214"></span>nation
of *Only-begotten* on account of his connection with him who in nature
is the Only-begotten of the Father; and besides, if any one calls
another than the Emmanuel Christ let him be anathema.

<span id="x.ix.viii-p9"></span>(*Declaratio Septima*.)

<span id="x.ix.viii-p10"></span>When the blessed Gabriel announced to
the holy Virgin the generation of the only-begotten Son of God according
to the flesh, he said, “Thou shalt bear a son; and thou shalt call his
name Jesus, for he shall save his people from their sins.”  But he was
named also Christ, because that according to his human nature he was
anointed with us, according to the words of the Psalmist:  “Thou hast
loved righteousness and hated iniquity:  therefore God, even thy God
hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.”  For
although he was the giver of the Holy Spirit, neither did he give it by
measure to them that were worthy (for he was full of the Holy Ghost, and
of his fulness have we all received, as it is written), nevertheless as
he is man he was called anointed economically, the Holy Spirit resting
upon him spiritually (<span class="Greek"><span
id="x.ix.viii-p10.1"></span>νοητῶς</span>) and not after the manner of
men, in order that he might abide in us, although he had been driven
forth from us in the beginning by Adam’s fall.  He therefore the only
begotten Word of God made flesh was called Christ.  And since he
possessed as his own the power proper to God, he wrought his wonders. 
Whosoever therefore shall say that the glory of the Only-begotten was
added to the power of Christ, as though the Only-begotten was different
from Christ, they are thinking of two sons; the one truly working and
the other impelled (by the strength of another, *Lat*.) as a man like to
us; and all such fall under the penalty of this anathematism.
