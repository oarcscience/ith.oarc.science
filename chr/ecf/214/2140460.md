<span id="xiv.iii.lxxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xiv.iii.lxxvii-p1.1"></span>Canon LXXVI.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.lxxvii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.lxxvii-p2.1"></span>It</span> is not right that those who
are responsible for reverence to churches should place within the sacred
bounds an eating place, nor offer food there, nor make other sales.  For
God our Saviour teaching us when he was tabernacling in the flesh
commanded not <span id="page_399">p. 399</span> <span
id="xiv.iii.lxxvii-Page_399"></span>to make his Father’s house a house
of merchandize.  He also poured out the small coins of the
money-changers, and drave out all those who made common the temple.  If,
therefore, anyone shall be taken in the aforesaid fault let him be cut
off.

<span id="xiv.iii.lxxvii-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.lxxvii-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon LXXVI.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.lxxvii-p5"></span>A public house should not be
established within the sacred precincts; and it is wrong to sell food
there; and whosoever shall do so shall be cut off.

<span id="xiv.iii.lxxvii-p6"></span>Both Balsamon and Zonaras remark
that this canon refers to the vestibule of the church and to the rest of
the sacred inclosure, and not to the interior of the church proper, for
there no one would ever think of having a shop.
