id="xv.iii.iv.i-p1.1"></span>The Canons of the Council of
Sardica.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.iv.i-p2"></span>The holy synod assembled in Sardica
from various provinces decreed as follows.

<span id="xv.iii.iv.i-p3"></span>(*Found in Greek in John of
Constantinople’s collection of the sixth century and several other <span
class="sc"><span id="xv.iii.iv.i-p3.1"></span>mss.</span>  Found also in
the works of the Greek scholiasts.  Found in Latin in the* Prisca*, in
Dionysius Exiguus, and in Isidore, genuine and false*.)

<span id="xv.iii.iv.i-p4"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xv.iii.iv.i-p4.1"></span>Canon I.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.iv.i-p5"></span>(*Greek*.)

<span id="xv.iii.iv.i-p6"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iii.iv.i-p6.1"></span>Hosius</span>, bishop of the city of
Corduba, said:  A prevalent evil, or rather most mischievous corruption
must be done away with from its very foundations.  Let no bishop be
allowed to remove from a small city to a different one:  as there is an
obvious reason for this fault, accounting for such attempts; since no
bishop could ever yet be found who endeavoured to be translated from a
larger city to a smaller one.  It is therefore evident that such persons
are inflamed with excessive covetousness and are only serving ambition
in order to have the repute of possessing greater authority.  Is it then
the pleasure of all that so grave an abuse be punished with great
severity?  For I think that men of this sort should not be admitted even
to lay communion.  All the bishops said:  It is the pleasure of all.

<span id="xv.iii.iv.i-p7"></span>(*Latin*.)

<span id="xv.iii.iv.i-p8"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iii.iv.i-p8.1"></span>Bishop Hosius</span> said:  A prevalent
evil and mischievous corruption must be done away with from its
foundation.  Let no bishop be allowed to remove from his own city to
another.  For the reason of such attempts is manifest, since in this
matter no bishop has been found who would remove from a larger city to a
smaller one.  It is therefore evident that these men are inflamed with
excess of covetousness, and are serving ambition and aiming at the
possession of power.  If it be the pleasure of all, let so great an evil
be punished right harshly and sternly, so that he who is such shall not
even be admitted to lay communion.  All with one accord answered:  Such
is our pleasure.

id="xv.iii.iv.i-p10.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon I.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.iv.i-p11"></span>No bishop is to be found passing from
a smaller to a greater city.  If anyone should move from an humble to a
more important see, he shall be excommunicated through his whole life as
proud and grasping.

<span id="xv.iii.iv.i-p13"></span>(*Dissert. in Synod. Sard*., §
II. <span id="fr_388"></span>[389](#fn_388) .md)

<span id="xv.iii.iv.i-p15"></span>What Peter de Marca says (*De
Concordia Sacerdotii et Imp*., Lib. V., cap. iv.), “Hosius presided
over” this council as legate of the Roman bishop, rests upon no solid
foundation, and no trace of any such legation is found in Athanasius or
in any of the other writers who treated of this synod.  Moreover such a
thing is contrary to the form of subscription used.  For of those who
signed the first is Hosius, and Athanasius designates him simply as
“from Spain,” without any addition; and then next he mentions “Julius of
Rome, by Archidamus and Philoxenus, his presbyters,” etc.  What is
clearer than that, by the testimony of Athanasius, Julius was present by
these two presbyters only, and that they only were his legates or
vicars, who in his room were present at this synod?

<span id="xv.iii.iv.i-p16"></span>The first part of this canon is found
in the *Corpus Juris Canonici*; Raymund’s *Decretales*, *De Clericis non
residentibus*, Cap. ii.
