<span id="xvi.xiv.xxi-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xvi.xiv.xxi-p1.1"></span>Canon XXI.</span>

<span id="xvi.xiv.xxi-p2"></span>That monks are not to leave their
monasteries and go into others.

<span id="xvi.xiv.xxi-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xvi.xiv.xxi-p3.1"></span>A monk</span> or nun ought not to leave the
monastery to which he or she is attached, and betake themselves to
others.  But if one do this, he ought to be received as a guest.  It is
not however proper that he be made a member of the monastery, without
the consent of his hegumenos.

<span id="xvi.xiv.xxi-p5"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xvi.xiv.xxi-p5.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XXI.</span>

<span id="xvi.xiv.xxi-p6"></span>It is not allowed to a monk or a nun to
leave her own house and enter another; but if he (or she) enters let
(him or her) be received as a guest; but let him (or her) not be
admitted at all nor given hospitality contrary to the will of the
superior.

<span id="xvi.xiv.xxi-p7"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xvi.xiv.xxi-p7.1"></span>Aristenus</span>.

<span id="xvi.xiv.xxi-p8"></span>The present canon does not allow a monk
or a nun who goes to another house to be received into, nor even to be
admitted as a guest, lest by force of necessity he be led astray to
worldly things and so remain.  Moreover it does not permit a woman to be
admitted and received and reckoned in the number of the sisters without
the consent of the superior.

<span id="xvi.xiv.xxi-p9"></span>It seems to me that in Aristenus an
<span class="Greek"><span id="xvi.xiv.xxi-p9.1"></span>οὐκ</span> must
have crept into the text and that the first sentence should read as now
but omitting the “not.”  This makes him agree with Zonaras who says “the
man must be received as a guest lest he go to a profane tavern and be
forced to associate with those who have never learned how to live
decently.”  It is clear that the “superior” referred to is that of the
house whence the monk or nun went forth.
