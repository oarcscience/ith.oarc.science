<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxxx-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.cxxx-p1.1"></span>Canon CXXIX.  (Greek cxxx.)</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxxx-p2"></span>That slaves and freedmen and all
infamous persons ought not to bring accusation.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxxx-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.cxxx-p3.1"></span>To</span> all it seemed good that no
slaves or freedmen, properly so called, be admitted to accusation nor
any of those who by the public laws are debarred from bringing
accusation in criminal proceedings.  This also is the case with all
those who have the stain of infamy, that is actors, and persons subject
to turpitudes, also heretics, or heathen, or Jews; but even all those to
whom the right of bringing accusation is denied, are not forbidden to
bring accusation in their own suits.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxxx-p6"></span>A slave, and a freedman, and he who
before was accused of any of these crimes on account of which he is not
admitted in court, and a player, and a heathen, and a heretic, and a
Jew.

sentence.  However, this is intended as a continuation of the epitome of
the former canon, the words to be supplied being “are not to give
witness.”\]
