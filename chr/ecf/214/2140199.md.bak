<span id="viii.vii.iii.xxxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="viii.vii.iii.xxxiii-p1.1"></span>Canon XXVIII.</span>

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xxxiii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.vii.iii.xxxiii-p2.1"></span>It</span> is not permitted to hold
love feasts, as they are called, in the Lord’s Houses, or Churches, nor
to eat and to spread couches in the house of God.

id="viii.vii.iii.xxxiii-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon
XXVII.</span>

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xxxiii-p5"></span>Beds shall not be set up in
churches, nor shall love feasts be held there.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xxxiii-p7"></span>Eusebius (*H. E.*, Lib. IX.,
Cap. X.) employs the expression <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.vii.iii.xxxiii-p7.1"></span>κυριακά</span> in the same sense as
does this canon as identical with churches.  The prohibition itself,
however, here given, as well as the preceding canon, proves that as
early as the time of the Synod of Laodicea, many irregularities had
crept into the *agape*.  For the rest, this Synod was not in a position
permanently to banish the usage from the Church; for which reason the
Trullan Synod in its seventy-fourth canon repeated this rule word for
word.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xxxiii-p8"></span>This canon is found in the
*Corpus Juris Canonici*, Gratian’s *Decretum*, Pars I., Disk XLII., c.
iv.
