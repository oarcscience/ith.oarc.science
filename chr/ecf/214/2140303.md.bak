<span id="xi.iii-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xi.iii-p2.1"></span>Session I.</span>

<span id="xi.iii-p3"></span>(Labbe and Cossart, *Concilia*, Tom. IV.,
col. 93.)

<span id="xi.iii-p4"></span>Paschasinus, the most reverend bishop and
legate of the Apostolic See, stood up in the midst with his most
reverend colleagues and said:  We received directions at the hands of
the most blessed and apostolic bishop of the Roman city, which is the
head of all the churches, which directions say that Dioscorus is not to
be allowed a seat in this assembly, but that if he should attempt to
take his seat he is to be cast out.  This instruction we must carry out;
if now your holiness so commands let him be expelled or else we
leave. <span id="fr_277"></span>[278](#fn_277.md)

<span id="xi.iii-p6"></span>The most glorious judges and the full senate
said:  What special charge do you prefer against the most reverend
bishop Dioscorus?

<span id="xi.iii-p7"></span>Paschasinus, the most reverend bishop and
legate of the Apostolic See, said:  Since he has come, it is necessary
that objection be made to him.

<span id="xi.iii-p8"></span>The most glorious judges and the whole
senate said:  In accordance with what has been said, let the charge
under which he lies, be specifically made.

<span id="xi.iii-p9"></span>Lucentius, the most reverend bishop having
the place of the Apostolic See, said:  Let him give a reason for his
judgment.  For he undertook to give sentence against one over whom he
had no jurisdiction.  And he dared to hold a synod without the authority
of the Apostolic See, a thing which had never taken place nor can take
place. <span id="fr_278"></span>[279](#fn_278.md)

<span id="xi.iii-p11"></span>Paschasinus the most reverend bishop,
holding the place of the Apostolic See, said:  We cannot go counter to
the decrees of the most blessed and apostolic bishop \[“Pope” for
“bishop” in the Latin\], who governs the Apostolic See, nor against the
ecclesiastical canons nor the patristic traditions.

<span id="xi.iii-p12"></span>The most glorious judges and the full
senate, said:  It is proper that you should set forth specifically in
what he hath gone astray.

<span id="xi.iii-p13"></span>Lucentius, the venerable bishop and holding
the place of the Apostolic See, said:  We will not suffer so great a
wrong to be done us and you, as that he who is come to be judged should
sit down \[as one to give judgment\].

<span id="xi.iii-p14"></span>The glorious judges and the whole senate
said:  If you hold the office of judge, you ought not to defend yourself
as if you were to be judged.

<span id="xi.iii-p15"></span>And when Dioscorus the most religious
bishop of Alexandria at the bidding of the most glorious judges and of
the sacred assembly (<span class="Greek"><span
id="xi.iii-p15.1"></span>τῆς ἱερᾶς συγκλήτου</span> <span
id="fr_279"></span>[280](#fn_279) .md) had sat down in the midst, and the
most reverend Roman bishops also had sat down in their proper places,
and kept silence, Eusebius, the most reverend bishop of the city of
Dorylæum, stepping into the midst, said:

<span id="xi.iii-p17"></span>\[*He then presented a petition, and the
Acts of the Latrocinium were read.  Also the Acts of the council of
Constantinople under Flavian against Eutyches* (col. 175).\]

<span id="xi.iii-p18"></span>And when they were read, the most glorious
judges and immense assembly (<span class="Greek"><span
id="xi.iii-p18.1"></span>ὑπερφυὴς σύγκλητος</span>) said:  What do the
most reverend bishops of the present holy synod say?  When he thus
expounded the faith did Flavian, of holy memory, preserve the orthodox
and catholic religion, or did he in any respect err concerning it?

<span id="xi.iii-p19"></span>Paschasinus the most reverend bishop,
representing the Apostolic See, said; Flavian of blessed memory hath
most holily and perfectly expounded the faith.  His faith and exposition
agrees with the epistle of the most blessed and apostolic man, the
bishop of Rome.

<span id="xi.iii-p20"></span>Anatolius the most reverend archbishop of
Constantinople said; The blessed Fla<span id="page_248">p. 248</span>
<span id="xi.iii-Page_248"></span>vian hath beautifully and orthodoxly
set forth the faith of our fathers.

<span id="xi.iii-p21"></span>Lucentius, the most reverend bishop, and
legate of the Apostolic See, said; Since the faith of Flavian of blessed
memory agrees with the Apostolic See and the tradition of the fathers it
is just that the sentence by which he was condemned by the heretics
should be turned back upon them by this most holy synod.

<span id="xi.iii-p22"></span>Maximus the most reverend bishop of Antioch
in Syria, said:  Archbishop Flavian of blessed memory hath set forth the
faith orthodoxly and in accordance with the most beloved-of-God and most
holy Archbishop Leo.  And this we all receive with zeal.

<span id="xi.iii-p23"></span>Thalassius, the most reverend bishop of
Cæsarea in Cappadocia said; Flavian of blessed memory hath spoken in
accordance with Cyril of blessed memory.

<span id="xi.iii-p24"></span>\[*And so, one after another, the bishops
expressed their opinions.  The reading of the acts of the Council of
Constantinople was then continued*.\]

<span id="xi.iii-p25"></span>And at this point of the reading,
Dioscorus, the most reverend Archbishop of Alexandria said, I receive
“the of two;” “the two” I do not receive (<span class="Greek"><span
id="xi.iii-p25.1"></span>τὸ ἐκ δύο δέχομαι· τὸ δύο, οὐ δέχομαι</span>). 
I am forced to be impudent, but the matter is one which touches my soul.

<span id="xi.iii-p26"></span>\[*After a few remarks the reading was
continued and the rest of the acts of the Latrocinium of Ephesus
completed.  The judges then postponed to the morrow the setting forth a
decree on the faith but intimated that Dioscorus and his associates
should suffer the punishment to which they unjustly sentenced Flavian. 
This met with the approval of all the bishops except those of Illyrica
who said:  “We all have erred, let us all be pardoned.”*  (col. 323.) \]

<span id="xi.iii-p27"></span>The most glorious judges and the whole
senate said; Let each one of the most reverend bishops of the present
synod, hasten to set forth how he believes, writing without any fear,
but placing the fear of God before his eyes; knowing that our most
divine and pious lord believes according to the ecthesis of the three
hundred and eighteen holy fathers at Nice, and according to the ecthesis
of the one hundred and fifty after them, and according to the Canonical
epistles and ectheses of the holy fathers Gregory, Basil, Athanasius,
Hilary, Ambrose, and according to the two canonical epistles of Cyril,
which were confirmed and published in the first Council of Ephesus, nor
does he in any point depart from the faith of the same.  For the most
reverend archbishop of Old Rome, Leo, appears to have sent a letter to
Flavian of blessed memory, with reference to Eutyches’s unbelieving
doubt which was springing up against the Catholic Church.

id="xi.iii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xi.iii-p5"></span> This whole paragraph reads with material
differences in the Latin.  Moreover while the Greek text is clear and
grammatical, the Latin is most incorrect and halting.  Leo is described
as “Pope of the city of Rome,” instead of “bishop of Rome.”

<span id="fn_278"></span>[247:279](2140303.htm#fr_278.md) <span
id="xi.iii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xi.iii-p10"></span> This statement, so absolutely contrary to
fact, has been a sore difficulty to the commentators.  Arendt (*Leo the
Great and his Times*, § 270) says that this meant only that “he had,
without permission of the Pope, taken the presidency there, and
conducted the proceedings, for Leo himself had acknowledged the synod by
the fact that he allowed his legates to be present at it.”  Almost the
same is the explanation of the Ballerini (Leo M. *Opera*, Tom. ii. 460,
n. 15.)

<span id="fn_279"></span>[247:280](2140303.htm#fr_279.md) <span
id="xi.iii-p15.2"></span>

<span id="xi.iii-p16"></span> The Latin here has the usual form
“amplissimus senatus,” for which the Greek is <span class="Greek"><span
id="xi.iii-p16.1"></span>περιφανέστατοι συγκλητικοὶ</span>.
