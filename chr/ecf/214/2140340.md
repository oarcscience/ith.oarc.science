<span id="xi.xviii.xxii-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xi.xviii.xxii-p1.1"></span>Canon XXII.</span>

<span id="xi.xviii.xxii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xi.xviii.xxii-p2.1"></span>It</span> is not lawful for clergymen,
after the death of their bishop, to seize what belongs to him, as has
been forbidden also by the ancient canons; and those who do so shall be
in danger of degradation from their own rank.

<span id="xi.xviii.xxii-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xi.xviii.xxii-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XXII.</span>

<span id="xi.xviii.xxii-p5"></span>Whoever seizes the goods of his
deceased bishop shall be cast forth from his rank.

<span id="xi.xviii.xxii-p6"></span>It is curious that the Greek text
which Zonaras and Balsamon produce, and which Hervetus translated, had
instead of <span class="Greek"><span
id="xi.xviii.xxii-p6.1"></span>το</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="xi.xviii.xxii-p6.2"></span>ῖς πάλαι κανόσι</span>, <span
class="Greek"><span id="xi.xviii.xxii-p6.3"></span>τοις
παραλαμβάνουσιν</span> .  Van Espen thinks that the Greek commentators
have tried without success to attach any meaning to these words,
accepting the arguments of Bp. Beveridge (which see).  The reading
adopted in the text does not lack <span class="sc"><span
id="xi.xviii.xxii-p6.4"></span>ms.</span> authority, and is the one
printed by Justellus in his “Codex of the Canons of the Universal
Church.”

<span id="xi.xviii.xxii-p7"></span>This canon is found in the *Corpus
Juris Canonici*, Gratian’s *Decretum*, Pars II., Causa XII., Quæst. II.,
canon xliii., in Isidore’s version.
