without letters commendatory from their own Bishop, are absolutely
prohibited from officiating in another city.

<span id="xi.xviii.xiii-p5"></span>No cleric shall be received to
communion in another city without a letter commendatory.

<span id="xi.xviii.xiii-p6"></span>“Unknown clergymen.”  I have here
followed the reading of the Greek commentators.  But the translators of
the *Prisca*, and Dionysius, and Isidore must have all read <span
class="Greek"><span id="xi.xviii.xiii-p6.1"></span>ἀναγνώστας</span>
(i.e., Readers) instead of <span class="Greek"><span
id="xi.xviii.xiii-p6.2"></span>ἀγνώστους</span>.  Justellus, Hervetus,
and Beveridge, as also Johnson and Hammond, follow the reading of the
text.  Hefele suggests that if “Readers” is the correct reading perhaps
it means, “all clergymen even readers.”
