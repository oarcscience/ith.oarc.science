<span id="vii.vi.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="vii.vi.xiv-p1.1"></span>Canon IX.</span>

<span id="vii.vi.xiv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="vii.vi.xiv-p2.1"></span>If</span> any presbyters have been advanced
without examination, or if upon examination they have made confession of
crime, and men acting in violation of the canon have laid hands upon
them, notwithstanding their confession, such the canon does not admit;
for the Catholic Church requires that \[only\] which is blameless.

<span id="vii.vi.xiv-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="vii.vi.xiv-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon IX.</span>

<span id="vii.vi.xiv-p5"></span>Whoever are ordained without
examination, shall be deposed if it be found out afterwards that they
had been guilty.

<span id="vii.vi.xiv-p7"></span>The crimes in question are those which
were a bar to the priesthood—such as blasphemy, bigamy, heresy,
idolatry, magic, etc.—as the Arabic paraphrase of Joseph explains.  It
is clear that these faults are punishable in the bishop no less than in
the priest, and that consequently our canon refers to the bishops as
well as to the <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.vi.xiv-p7.1"></span>πρεσβύτεροι</span> in the more restricted
sense.  These words of the Greek text, “In the case in which any one
might be <span id="page_24">p. 24</span> <span
id="vii.vi.xiv-Page_24"></span>induced, in opposition to the canon, to
ordain such persons,” allude to the ninth canon of the Synod of
Neocæsarea.  It was necessary to pass such ordinances; for even in the
fifth century, as the twenty-second letter to Pope Innocent the First
testifies, some held that as baptism effaces all former sins, so it
takes away all the *impedimenta ordinationis* which are the results of
those sins.

<span id="vii.vi.xiv-p8"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="vii.vi.xiv-p8.1"></span>Balsamon.</span>

<span id="vii.vi.xiv-p9"></span>Some say that as baptism makes the
baptized person a new man, so ordination takes away the sins committed
before ordination, which opinion does not seem to agree with the canons.

<span id="vii.vi.xiv-p10"></span>This canon occurs twice in the *Corpus
Juris Canonici*.  *Decretum* Pars I. Dist. xxiv. c. vij., and Dist.
lxxxj., c. iv.
