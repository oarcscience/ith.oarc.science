id="viii.vii.iii.xxxvi-p2.1"></span>It</span> is not lawful to make
marriages with all \[sorts of\] heretics, nor to give our sons and
daughters to them; but rather to take of them, if they promise to become
Christians.

id="viii.vii.iii.xxxvi-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon
XXXI.</span>

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xxxvi-p5"></span>It is not right to give children
in marriage to heretics, but they should be received if they promise to
become Christians.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xxxvi-p6"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.vii.iii.xxxvi-p6.1"></span>Van Espen.</span>

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xxxvi-p7"></span>By this canon the faithful are
forbidden to contract marriage with heretics or to join their children
in such; for, as both Balsamon and Zonaras remark, “they imbue them with
their errors, and lead them to embrace their own perverse opinions.”
