<span id="xv.iv.iv.liii-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.liii-p1.1"></span>Canon LII.  (Greek lvi.)</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.liii-p2"></span>Of visiting provinces.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.liii-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.liii-p3.1"></span>Honoratus</span> and Urban, the bishops,
said:  This was commanded to us in word, that because it had been
decreed in the Council of Hippo that each province should be visited in
the time of the council, that ye also deign that this year or next,
according to the order ye have drawn up, you should visit the province
of Mauritania.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.liii-p4"></span>Aurelius, the bishop, said:  Of the
province of Mauritania because it is situated in the confines of Africa,
we have made no decree, for they are neighbours of the barbarians; but
God grant (not however that I make any rash promise of doing so), we may
be able to come to your province.  For ye should consider, brethren,
that this same thing our brethren of Tripoli and of the Arzuges
region <span id="fr_453"></span>[454](#fn_453.md) could demand also, if
occasion offered.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.liii-p7"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.liii-p7.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon LII.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.liii-p8"></span>As the Synod at Hippo decreed, every
province should be visited in an annual Synod.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.liii-p9"></span>This canon is the last part of canon
iv. of the Council of Carthage, August 28th, <span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.liii-p9.1"></span>a.d.</span> 397.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.liii-p10"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.liii-p10.1"></span>Johnson.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.liii-p11"></span>The manner of visiting provinces,
and that annually; and the persons by whom this visitation was
performed, can scarce now be discovered; only it appears, by the words
of Aurelius, that the Bishop of Carthage was one, if not the only
visitor; but it was impossible that he could visit all the provinces in
Africa personally every year, he must use delegates.

*Johannid* in *Mon. Germ*. *Hist*. (in the Series *Auctores
Antiquissimi*), Proem, p. xiv.  It seems from Orosius that the same
province was called Tripolitana and Regio Arzugum, and that *Arzuges*
was a race name of wider application.
