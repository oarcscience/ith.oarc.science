<span id="xiv.iii.xcix-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xiv.iii.xcix-p1.1"></span>Canon XCVIII.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.xcix-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.xcix-p2.1"></span>He</span> who brings to the intercourse of
marriage a woman who is betrothed to another man who is still alive, is
to lie under the charge of adultery.

<span id="xiv.iii.xcix-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.xcix-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XCVIII.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.xcix-p5"></span>He is an adulterer who takes one
espoused to some one else.

<span id="xiv.iii.xcix-p6"></span>Aristenus’s commentary on this canon
is <span class="Greek"><span
id="xiv.iii.xcix-p6.1"></span>Σαφής</span>.  A more extraordinary
estimate of it could hardly be made.  So far from the meaning being
“perspicuous,” as the Latin translation has it, the meaning seems to be
past finding out; for, as Van Espen remarks, a man who sins with a
betrothed woman is certainly not an “adulterer.”  He tries therefore to
introduce the idea that though he is not an adulterer, yet he is to be
punished as if he were.  But the Greek hardly seems patient of this
meaning, and the Ancient Epitome says in so many words that he is an
adulterer.

<span id="xiv.iii.xcix-p7"></span>On account of this difficulty some
have supposed that the espousals here mentioned were not *de futuro* but
*de prœsenti*, and that therefore it was the case of stealing a real
wife of another man.  But this explanation also is involved in many
difficulties.
