how important and how large is the metropolitan city of Thessalonica. 
Accordingly presbyters and deacons often come to it from other provinces
and, not content with staying a short time, remain and make it their
permanent place of residence, or are compelled with difficulty and after
a very long delay to return to their own churches.  A decree should be
made bearing on this matter.

<span id="xv.iii.iv.xvii-p4"></span>Bishop Hosius said:  Let those
decrees which have been made in the case of bishops, be observed as to
these persons also.

remain a short time, but either make their residence there or at least
are with difficulty compelled to return after a long interval to their
own place.

which have been decreed in the case of bishops ought to be observed as
to these persons also.
