<span id="viii.vii.iii.l-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.vii.iii.l-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XLV.</span>

<span id="viii.vii.iii.l-p5"></span>After two weeks of Lent no one must
be admitted for illumination, for all such should fast from its
beginning.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.l-p6"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.vii.iii.l-p6.1"></span>Van Espen.</span>

<span id="viii.vii.iii.l-p7"></span>To the understanding of this canon
it must be remembered that such of the Gentiles as desired to become
Catholics and to be baptized, at first were privately instructed by the
catechists.  After this, having acquired some knowledge of the Christian
religion, they were admitted to the public instructions given by the
bishop in church; and were therefore called *Audientes* and for the
first time properly-speaking *Catechumens*.  But when these catechumens
had been kept in this rank a sufficient time and had been there tried,
they were allowed to go up to the higher grade called *Genuflectentes*.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.l-p8"></span>And when their exercises had been
completed in this order they were brought by the catechists who had had
the charge of them, to the bishop, that on the Holy Sabbath \[Easter
Even\] they might receive baptism, and the catechumens gave their names
at the same time, so that they might be set down for baptism at the
coming Holy Sabbath.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.l-p9"></span>Moreover we learn from St. Augustine
(Serm. xiii., Ad Neophitos,) that the time for the giving in of the
names was the beginning of Lent.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.l-p10"></span>This council therefore in this
canon decrees that such as do not hand in their names at the beginning
of Lent, but after two weeks are past, shall not be admitted to baptism
on the next Holy Sabbath.
