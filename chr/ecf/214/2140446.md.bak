<span id="xiv.iii.lxiii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.lxiii-p2.1"></span>The</span> so-called Calends, and what
are called Bota and Brumalia, and the full assembly which takes place on
the first of March, we wish to be abolished from the life of the
faithful.  And also the public dances of women, which may do much harm
and mischief.  Moreover we drive away from the life of Christians the
dances given in the names of those falsely called gods by the Greeks
whether of men or women, and which are performed after an ancient and
un-Christian fashion; decreeing that no man from this time forth shall
be dressed as a woman, nor any woman in the garb suitable to men.  Nor
shall he assume comic, satyric, or tragic masks; nor may men invoke the
name of the execrable Bacchus when they squeeze out the wine in the
presses; nor when pouring out wine into jars \[to cause a laugh <span
id="fr_377"></span>[378](#fn_377.md) \], practising in ignorance and vanity
the things which proceed from the deceit of insanity.  Therefore those
who in the future attempt any of these things which are written, having
obtained a knowledge of them, if they be clerics we order them to be
deposed, and if laymen to be cut off.

<span id="xiv.iii.lxiii-p6"></span>Let these be taken away from the
lives of the faithful, viz.:  the Bota, and the Calends, and the
Brumalia, and salutations in honour of the gods, and comic, satyric and
tragic masks, and the invocation of Bacchus at the wine press, and the
laughing at the wine jars.  Whoever shall persist in these after this
canon shall be liable to give an account.

<span id="xiv.iii.lxiii-Page_394"></span>On the *Calends* see Du Cange
(*Glossarium* in loc.).  The *Bota* were feasts in honour of Pan, the
*Brumalia* feasts in honour of Bacchus.  Many particulars with regard to
these superstitions will be found in Balsamon’s scholion, to which the
curious reader is referred.  Van Espen also has some valuable notes on
the Kalends of January.
