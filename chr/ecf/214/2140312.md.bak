<span id="xi.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xi.xii-p1.1"></span>Session V.</span>

<span id="xi.xii-p2"></span>(Labbe and Cossart, *Concilia*, Tom. IV.,
col. 555.)

<span id="xi.xii-p3"></span>Paschasinus and Lucentius the most reverend
bishops and Boniface a presbyter, vicars of the Apostolic See of Rome,
said:  If they do not agree to the letter of that apostolic and blessed
man, Pope Leo, give directions that we be given our letters of
dismission, and let a synod be held there \[i.e. in the West\].

<span id="xi.xii-p4"></span>\[*A long debate then followed as to whether
the decree drawn up and presented should be accepted.  This seems to
have been the mind of most of the bishops.  At last the commissioners
proposed a committee of twenty-two to meet with them and report to the
council, and the Emperor imposed this with the threat that otherwise
they all should be sent home and a new council called in the West.  Even
this did not make them yield* (col. 560.)\]

<span id="xi.xii-p5"></span>The most reverend bishops cried out:  Many
years to the Emperor!  Either let the definition \[i.e. the one
presented at this session\] stand or we go.  Many years to the Emperor!

<span id="xi.xii-p6"></span>Cecropius, the most reverend bishop of
Sebastopol, said:  We ask that the definition be read again and that
those who dissent from it, and will not sign, may go about their
business; for we give our consent to these things which have been so
beautifully drafted, and make no criticisms.

<span id="xi.xii-p7"></span>The most blessed bishops of Illyria said: 
Let those who contradict be made manifest.  Those who contradict are
Nestorians.  Those who contradict, let them go to Rome.

<span id="xi.xii-p8"></span>The most magnificent and most glorious
judges said:  Dioscorus acknowledged that he accepted the expression “of
two natures,” but not that there were two natures.  But the most holy
archbishop Leo says that there are two natures in Christ unchangeably,
inseparably, unconfusedly united in the one only-begotten Son our
Saviour.  Which would you follow, the most holy Leo or Dioscorus?

<span id="xi.xii-p9"></span>The most reverend bishops cried out:  We
believe as Leo.  Those who contradict are Eutychians.  Leo hath rightly
expounded the faith.

<span id="xi.xii-p10"></span>The most magnificent and glorious judges
said:  Add then to the definition, according to the judgment of our most
holy father Leo, that there are two natures in Christ united
unchangeably, inseparably, unconfusedly.

<span id="xi.xii-p11"></span>\[*The Committee then sat in the oratory of
the most holy martyr Euphemis and afterwards reported a definition of
faith which while teaching the same doctrine was not the Tome of Leo*
(col. 562).\]
