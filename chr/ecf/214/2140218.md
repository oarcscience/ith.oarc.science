anyone baptized clinically a short while afterwards.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.lii-p7"></span>Some unbelievers were baptized
before they had been catechized, by reason of the urgency of the
illness.  Now some thought that as their baptism did not follow their
being catechumens, they ought to be catechized and baptized over again. 
And in support of this opinion they urged Canon XII. of Neocæsarea,
which does not permit one clinically baptized to become a priest
rashly.  For this reason it is that the Fathers decree that such an one
shall not be baptized a second time, but as soon as he gets well he
shall learn the faith and the mystery of baptism, and to appreciate the
divine gifts he has received, viz., the confession of the one true God
and the remission of sins which comes to us in holy baptism.
