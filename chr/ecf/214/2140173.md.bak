<span id="viii.vii.iii.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="viii.vii.iii.vii-p1.1"></span>Canon VI.</span>

<span id="viii.vii.iii.vii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.vii.iii.vii-p2.1"></span>It</span> is not permitted to heretics
to enter the house of God while they continue in heresy.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.vii-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.vii.iii.vii-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon VI.</span>

<span id="viii.vii.iii.vii-p5"></span>The holy place is forbidden to
heretics.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.vii-p6"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.vii.iii.vii-p6.1"></span>Aristenus.</span>

<span id="viii.vii.iii.vii-p7"></span>Heretics are not to be permitted
to enter the house of God, and yet Basil the Great, before this canon
was set forth, admitted Valens to the perfecting of the faithful \[i.e.,
to the witnessing the celebration of the Divine Mysteries\].

<span id="viii.vii.iii.vii-p8"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.vii.iii.vii-p8.1"></span>Van Espen.</span>

<span id="viii.vii.iii.vii-p9"></span>A heretic who pertinaciously
rejects the doctrine of the Church is rightly not allowed to enter the
house of God, in which his doctrine is set forth, so long as he
continues in his heresy.  For this reason when Timothy, Archbishop of
Alexandria, was consulted concerning the admission of heretics to
church, answered in the <span class="sc"><span
id="viii.vii.iii.vii-p9.1"></span>IX</span>th Canon of his *Canonical
Epistle*, that unless they were ready to promise to do penance and to
abandon their heresy, they could in no way be admitted to the prayers of
the faithful.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.vii-p10"></span>Contrast with this Canon lxxxiv.,
of the so-called <span class="sc"><span
id="viii.vii.iii.vii-p10.1"></span>IV</span>th Council of Carthage,
<span class="sc"><span id="viii.vii.iii.vii-p10.2"></span>a.d.</span>
398.
