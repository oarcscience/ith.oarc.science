<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.cxiii-p1.1"></span>Canon CXII.  (Greek cxiij.
continued.)</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxiii-p2"></span>That the grace of Christ gives not
only the knowledge of our duty, but also inspires us with a desire that
we may be able to accomplish what we know.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxiii-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.cxiii-p3.1"></span>Also</span>, whoever shall say that the
same grace of God through Jesus Christ our Lord helps us only in not
sinning by revealing to us and opening to our understanding the
commandments, so that we may know what to seek, what we ought to avoid,
and also that we should love to do so, but that through it we are not
helped so that we are able to do what we know we should do, let him be
anathema.  For when the Apostle says:  “Wisdom puffeth up, but charity
edifieth” it were truly infamous were we to believe <span
id="page_498">p. 498</span> <span
id="xv.iv.iv.cxiii-Page_498"></span>that we have the grace of Christ for
that which puffeth us up, but have it not for that which edifieth, since
in each case it is the gift of God, both to know what we ought to do,
and to love to do it; so that wisdom cannot puff us up while charity is
edifying us.  For as of God it is written, “Who teacheth man knowledge,”
so also it is written, “Love is of God.”

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxiii-p6"></span>Whoever says that the grace of God
is given to us only that we may know what we ought to do and what to
flee from, but not also that we may love the thing known, and be able to
accomplish it, let him be anathema.
