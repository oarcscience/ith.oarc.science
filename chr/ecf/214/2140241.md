who assembled at Constantinople during the Consulate of those
Illustrious Men, Flavius Eucherius and Flavius Evagrius on the VII of
the Ides of July. <span id="fr_227"></span>[228](#fn_227) </span>

<span id="ix.viii.i-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.viii.i-p3.1"></span>The</span> Bishops out of different provinces
assembled by the grace of God in Constantinople, on the summons of the
most religious Emperor Theodosius, have decreed as follows:

<span id="ix.viii.i-p4"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="ix.viii.i-p4.1"></span>Canon I.</span>

<span id="ix.viii.i-p5"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.viii.i-p5.1"></span>The</span> Faith of the Three Hundred and
Eighteen Fathers assembled at Nice in Bithynia shall not be set aside,
but shall remain firm.  And every heresy shall be anathematized,
particularly that of the Eunomians or \[*Anomæans, the Arians or*\]
Eudoxians, and that of the Semi-Arians or Pneumatomachi, and that of the
Sabellians, and that of the Marcellians, and that of the Photinians, and
that of the Apollinarians.

<span id="ix.viii.i-p7"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.viii.i-p7.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon I.</span>

<span id="ix.viii.i-p8"></span>Let the Nicene faith stand firm. 
Anathema to heresy.

<span id="ix.viii.i-p9"></span>There is a difference of reading in the
list of the heretics.  The reading I have followed in the text is that
given in Beveridge’s *Synodicon*.  The Greek text, however, in Labbe,
and with it agree the version of Hervetus and the text of Hefele,
reads:  “the Eunomians or Anomæans, the Arians or Eudoxians, the
Semi-Arians or Pneumatomachi, the Sabellians, Marcellians, Photinians
and Apollinarians.”  From this Dionysius only varies by substituting
“Macedonians” for “Semi-Arians.”  It would seem that this was the
correct reading.  I, however, have followed the other as being the more
usual.

<span id="ix.viii.i-p10"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ix.viii.i-p10.1"></span>Hefele.</span>

<span id="ix.viii.i-p11"></span>By the Eudoxians, whom this canon
identifies with the Arians \[according to his text, *vide supra*,\] is
meant that faction who, in contradistinction to the strict Arians or
Anomæans on one side, and the Semi-Arians on the other side, followed
the leadership of the Court Bishop Eudoxius (Bishop of Constantinople
under the Emperor Valens), and without being entirely Anomæan, yet very
decidedly inclined to the left of the Arian party—probably claiming to
represent the old and original Arianism.  But this canon makes the
Semi-Arians identical with the Pneumatomachians, and so far rightly,
that the latter sprang from the Semi-Arian party, and applied the Arian
principle to their doctrine of the Holy Ghost.  Lastly, by the
Marcellians are meant those pupils of Marcellus of Ancyra who remained
in the errors formerly propounded by him, while afterwards others, and
indeed he himself, once more acknowledged the truth.

<span id="ix.viii.i-p2"></span> Such is the caption in the old Greek
codices.  The vijth of the Ides is July 9th.  “From this (says Hefele)
we may conclude that this synod which according to Socrates, *H. E*., v.
8) begun May 381, lasted until July of that year.”
