<span id="xv.iv.iv.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.ix-p1.1"></span>Canon VIII.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.ix-p2"></span>Of those who make accusation against an
elder; and that no criminal is to be suffered to bring a charge against
a bishop.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.ix-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.ix-p3.1"></span>Numidius</span>, the bishop of Maxula,
said:  Moreover, there are very many, not of good life, who think that
their elders or bishops should be the butt for accusation; ought such to
be easily admitted or no?  Aurelius the bishop said:  Is it the pleasure
of your charity that he who is ensnared by divers wickednesses should
have no voice of accusation against these?

<span id="xv.iv.iv.ix-p4"></span>All the bishops said:  If he is
criminous, his accusation is not to be received.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.ix-p6"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.ix-p6.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon VIII.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.ix-p7"></span>It has seemed good that they who are
themselves defendants for crimes should not bring accusations; nor
should they be allowed to lay crimes to anyone’s charge.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.ix-p8"></span>This is Canon vi. of Genethlius’s Synod
at Carthage, <span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.ix-p8.1"></span>a.d.</span> 387 or 390.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.ix-p10"></span>See Canons 132 and 133 and
Constantinople Canon 6.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.ix-p11"></span>\[The “elders” mentioned in this canon
are\] probably the same with *senes* in other canons, viz.,
Metropolitans, as is generally believed.  The Latin here calls them
*Majores* <span id="page_447">p. 447</span> <span
id="xv.iv.iv.ix-Page_447"></span>*natu*, the Greek <span
class="Greek"><span id="xv.iv.iv.ix-p11.1"></span>πατέρας</span>. 
Bishop Beveridge supposes that the word denotes bishop, though perhaps
*Majores natu* may signify presbyters.  Justellus on the canon produces
some seeming authorities for this.
