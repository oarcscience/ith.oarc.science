<span id="xi.xviii.v-p8"></span>It is supposed by Hefele that the
bishops were thinking of the case of Bassian, who, in the eleventh
session (Oct. 29), pleaded that he had been violently ejected from the
see of Ephesus.  Stephen the actual bishop, answered that Bassian had
not been “ordained” for that see, but had invaded it and been justly
expelled.  Bassian rejoined that his original consecration for the see
of Evasa had been forcible even to brutality; that he had never even
visited Evasa, that therefore his appointment to Ephesus was not a
translation.  Ultimately, the Council cut the knot by ordering that a
new bishop should be elected, Basalan and Stephen retaining the
episcopal title and receiving allowances from the revenues of the see
(Mansi, vii. 273 *et seqq*.)

<span id="xi.xviii.v-p9"></span>This canon is found in the *Corpus Juris
Canonici*, Gratian’s *Decretum*, Pars II., Causa VII., Quæst. I., can.
