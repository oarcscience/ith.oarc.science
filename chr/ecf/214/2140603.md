<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxxx-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.lxxx-p1.1"></span>Canon LXXIX.  (Greek lxxxii.)</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxxx-p2"></span>Of clerics who do not take care to
have their causes argued within a year.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxxx-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.lxxx-p3.1"></span>It</span> was further decreed that as
often as clergymen convicted and confessed <span
id="fr_465"></span>[466](#fn_465) of any crime either on account of
eorum, quorum verecundiæ parcitur, or on account of the opprobrium to
the Church, and of the insolent glorying of heretics and Gentiles, if
perchance they are willing to be present at their cause and to assert
their innocence, let them do so within one year of their
excommunication; if in truth they neglect during a year to purge their
cause, their voice shall not be heard afterwards.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxxx-p6"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.lxxx-p6.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon LXXIX.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxxx-p7"></span>When a cleric has been convicted of a
crime, if he says his cause should be heard upon appeal, let the appeal
be made within a year; after that the appeal shall not be admitted.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxxx-p8"></span>This is Canon xiij. of Carthage,
September, <span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.lxxx-p8.1"></span>a.d.</span> 401.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxxx-p10"></span>Though the Latin syntax of this
canon is very confused, and, I am apt to think, corrupted, yet it is
evident enough, that this is the intention of it.
