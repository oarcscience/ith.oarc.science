<span id="xvi.xiv.xvii-p2"></span>That he shall not be allowed to begin
the building of an oratory, who has not the means wherewith to finish
it.

<span id="xvi.xiv.xvii-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xvi.xiv.xvii-p3.1"></span>Certain</span> monks having left their
monasteries because they desired to rule, and, unwilling to obey, are
undertaking to build oratories, but have not the means to finish them. 
Now whoever shall undertake to do anything of this sort, let him be
forbidden by the bishop of the place.  But if he have the means
wherewith to finish, let what he has designed be carried on to
completion.  The same rule is to be observed with regard to laymen and
clerics.
