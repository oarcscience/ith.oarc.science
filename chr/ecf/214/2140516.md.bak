id="xv.iii.iv.xxii-p3.2"></span>Hosius</span> said:  But some discretion
is here requisite, brethren dearly beloved, in case some should come to
those cities which are on the highway still ignorant of what has been
decreed in the council.  The bishop of such a city ought therefore to
admonish him \[a bishop so arriving\], and instruct him to send his
deacon from that place.  Upon this admonition he must, however, himself
return to his diocese.

<span id="xv.iii.iv.xxii-p6"></span>This proposition of Hosius in the
Roman Codex is joined as an appendix to the preceding canon.  The Greeks
omit it altogether, very likely either because it seemed to be a
proposition of Hosius’s rather than a synodal canon, for no adoption by
the synod is recorded:  or else because, even if it were a decree, it
was only of temporary character, that is to say, until the canons had
been sufficiently promulgated, and therefore some on the ground of
ignorance might be exempt from the threatened penalties.
