<span id="viii.iii.iii.xxv-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.xxv-p1.1"></span>Canon XXIV.</span>

<span id="viii.iii.iii.xxv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.xxv-p2.1"></span>They</span> who practice divination,
and follow the customs of the heathen, or who take men to their houses
for the invention of sorceries, or for lustrations, fall under the canon
of five years’ \[penance\], according to the prescribed degrees; that
is, three years as prostrators, and two of prayer without oblation.

<span id="viii.iii.iii.xxv-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.xxv-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XXIV.</span>

<span id="viii.iii.iii.xxv-p5"></span>Whoso uses vaticination and whoso
introduces anyone into his house for the sake of making a poison or a
lustration let him be subject to penance for five years.

<span id="viii.iii.iii.xxv-p6"></span>I read <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.xxv-p6.1"></span>ἐθνῶν</span> for <span
class="Greek"><span id="viii.iii.iii.xxv-p6.2"></span>χρόνων</span> and
accordingly translate “of the heathen.”

id="viii.iii.iii.xxv-p7.1"></span>Van Espen.</span>

<span id="viii.iii.iii.xxv-p8"></span>It is greatly to be desired that
bishops and pastors to-day would take example from the fathers of Ancyra
and devote their attention strenuously to eliminate superstition from
the people, and would expound with animation to the people the enormity
of this crime.
