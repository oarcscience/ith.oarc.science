<span id="x.ix.ix-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="x.ix.ix-p2.1"></span>If</span> anyone shall dare to say that the
assumed man (<span class="Greek"><span
id="x.ix.ix-p2.2"></span>ἀναληφθέντα</span> ) ought to be worshipped
together with God the Word, and glorified together with him, and
recognised together with him as God, and yet as two different things,
the one with the other (for this “Together with” is added \[*i.e*., by
the Nestorians\] to convey this meaning); and shall not rather with one
adoration worship the Emmanuel and pay to him one glorification, as \[it
is written\] “The Word was made flesh”:  let him be anathema.

<span id="x.ix.ix-p5"></span>VIII.

<span id="x.ix.ix-p6"></span>If any one says that the form of a servant
should, for its own sake, that is, in reference to its own nature, be
reverenced, and that it is the ruler of all things, and not rather, that
\[merely\] on account of its connection with the holy and in itself
universally-ruling nature of the Only-begotten, it is to be reverenced;
let him be anathema.

<span id="x.ix.ix-p7"></span><span class="sc"><span

<span id="x.ix.ix-p8"></span>On this point \[made by Nestorius, that
“the form of a servant is the ruler of all things”\] Marius Mercator has
already remarked with justice, that no Catholic had ever asserted
anything of the kind.

<span id="x.ix.ix-p9"></span>Petavius notes that the version of
Dionysius Exiguus is defective.

<span id="x.ix.ix-p10"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="x.ix.ix-p10.1"></span>Petavius.</span>

<span id="x.ix.ix-p11"></span>Nestorius captiously and maliciously
interpreted this as if the “form of a servant” according to its very
nature (*ratio*) was to be adored, that is should receive divine
worship.  But this is nefarious and far removed from the mind of Cyril. 
Since to such an extent only the human nature of Christ is one
suppositum with the divine, that he declares that each is the object of
one and an undivided adoration; lest if a double and dissimilar cultus
be attributed to each one, the divine person should be divided into two
adorable Sons and Christs, as we have heard Cyril often complaining.
