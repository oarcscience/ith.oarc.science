<span id="xv.v.ii-p2"></span>The acts of this Council are found in
Balsamon, page 761 of the Paris edition, with Hervetus’s translation. 
Labbe <span id="fr_497"></span>[498](#fn_497.md) has taken Balsamon’s text
and inserted it into his Collection, from which the following
translation is made.  There is another version extant in Leunclavius,
*Jus Græco-Roman*. p. 247.

<span id="xv.v.ii-p4"></span>On September the twenty-ninth of the year
394, a magnificent church, dedicated to SS. Peter and Paul, built by the
munificence of Rufinus the Prætoreal prefect, and situated at a place
called “the Oaks,” a suburb of Chalcedon, was consecrated.  Most
scholars have adopted Tillemont’s suggestion that this was the occasion
which brought the patriarchs of Alexandria and Antioch to
Constantinople, and that occasion was taken advantage of to hold a synod
with regard to the dispute as to the see of Bostra.  At this council, in
accordance with the canon of the Second Ecumenical Council, adopted only
a dozen years before, Constantinople took the first place and its bishop
presided, but so strong was the hold of Alexandria that three centuries
afterwards the Quinisext Synod speaks of this council as held “under
Nectarius and Theophilus.”  In passing it may not be amiss to remark
that St. Gregory of Nyssa and Theodore of Mopsuestia, and Flavian were
present at this council!  Well may Tillemont <span
id="fr_498"></span>[499](#fn_498.md) exclaim, “It is remarkable to see
Theophilus there with Flavian, although they were not in communion with
each other.”
