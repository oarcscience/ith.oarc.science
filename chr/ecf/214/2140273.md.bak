id="x.ix.xii-p2.1"></span>Whosoever</span> shall say that it is not the
divine Word himself, when he was made flesh and had become man as we
are, but another than he, a man born of a woman, yet different from him
(<span class="Greek"><span id="x.ix.xii-p2.2"></span>ἰδικῶς
ἄνθρωπον</span>), who is become our Great High Priest and Apostle; or if
any man shall say that he offered himself in sacrifice for himself and
not rather for us, whereas, being without sin, he had no need of
offering or sacrifice:  let him be anathema.

<span id="x.ix.xii-p6"></span>If any one maintains that the Word, who is
from the beginning, has become the high priest and apostle of our
confession, and has offered himself for us, and does not rather say that
it is the work of Emmanuel to be an apostle; and if any one in such a
manner divides the sacrifice between him who united \[the Word\] and him
who was united \[the manhood\] referring it to a common sonship, that
is, not giving to God that which is God’s, and to man that which is
man’s; let him be anathema.

<span id="x.ix.xii-p8"></span>(*Declaratio decima*.)

<span id="x.ix.xii-p9"></span>But I do not know how those who think
otherwise contend that the very Word of God made man, was not the
apostle and high-priest of our profession, but a man different from him;
who was born of the holy Virgin, was called our apostle and high-priest,
and came to this gradually; and that not only for us did he offer
himself a sacrifice to God and the Father, but also for himself.  A
statement which is wholly contrary to the right and undefiled faith, for
he did no sin, but was supe<span id="page_217">p. 217</span> <span
id="x.ix.xii-Page_217"></span>rior to fault and altogether free from
sin, and needed no sacrifice for himself.  Since those who think
differently were again unreasonably thinking of two sons, this
anathematism became necessary that their impiety might appear.
