<span id="viii.v.iv.i-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.v.iv.i-p4.1"></span>If</span> any one shall condemn marriage,
or abominate and condemn a woman who is a believer and devout, and
sleeps with her own husband, as though she could not enter the Kingdom
\[of heaven\] let him be anathema.

<span id="viii.v.iv.i-p6"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.v.iv.i-p6.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon I.</span>

<span id="viii.v.iv.i-p7"></span>Anathema to him who disregards
legitimate marriage.

<span id="viii.v.iv.i-p8"></span>When one considers how deeply the early
church was impressed with those passages of Holy Scripture which she
understood to set forth the superiority of the virgin over the married
estate, it ceases to be any source of astonishment that some should have
run into the error of condemning marriage as sinful.  The saying of our
Blessed Lord with reference to those who had become “eunuchs for the
kingdom of heaven’s sake,” <span id="fr_150"></span>[151](#fn_150.md) and
those words of St. Paul “He that giveth his virgin in marriage doeth
well, but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth better,” <span
id="fr_151"></span>[152](#fn_151.md) together with the striking passage in
the Revelation of those that were “not defiled with women for they are
virgins,” <span id="fr_152"></span>[153](#fn_152.md) were considered as
settling the matter for the new dispensation.  The earliest writers are
filled with the praises of virginity.  Its superiority underlies the
allegories of the Hermes Pastor; <span id="fr_153"></span>[154](#fn_153.md)
St. Justin Martyr speaks of “many men and women of sixty and seventy
years of age who from their childhood have been the disciples of Christ,
and have kept themselves uncorrupted,” <span
id="fr_154"></span>[155](#fn_154.md) and from that time on there is an
ever-swelling tide of praise; the reader must be referred to SS.
Cyprian, Athanasius, Cyril of Jerusalem, Jerome, Augustine, etc., etc. 
In fact the Council of Trent (it cannot be denied) only gave expression
to the view of all Christian antiquity both East and West, when it
condemned those who denied that “it is more blessed to remain virgin or
celibate than to be joined in marriage.” <span
id="fr_155"></span>[156](#fn_155.md)

<span id="viii.v.iv.i-p15"></span>This canon is found in the *Corpus
Juris Canonici*, Gratian’s *Decretum*, Pars I., Distinc. xxx., c. xii.
(Isidore’s version), and again Dist. xxxi., c. viii. (Dionysius’s
version).  Gratian, however, supposes that the canon is directed against
the Manichæans and refers to the marriage of priests, but in both
matters he is mistaken, as the Roman Correctors and Van Espen point out.

followers held all marriage to be sinful, Luther (at least at one time)
taught that it was a sin for anyone to remain unmarried who could
“increase and multiply!”  The Synod of Gangra in this canon sets forth
the unchanging position of the Catholic Church upon this point.
