<span id="xvii.vi-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.vi-p2.1"></span>The Canons of the Blessed Peter, Archbishop of
Alexandria, and Martyr, <span id="fr_584"></span>[585](#fn_584) which
are found in his Sermon on Penitence.</span>

<span id="xvii.vi-p4"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.vi-p4.1"></span>Canon I.</span>

<span id="xvii.vi-p5"></span>The fourth Easter from the beginning of the
persecution was now come; and orders, that they who did not fall till
after they had endured severe torments, and have already been “Mourners”
three years, after forty days’ fast, are to be admitted to communion,
although they have not been before received \[to penance\]. <span
id="fr_585"></span>[586](#fn_585)

<span id="xvii.vi-p7"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.vi-p7.1"></span>Canon II.</span>

<span id="xvii.vi-p8"></span>But if they endured imprisonment only,
without torments, let a year be added to their former penance.

<span id="xvii.vi-p9"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.vi-p9.1"></span>Canon III.</span>

<span id="xvii.vi-p10"></span>If they fell voluntarily, without torments
or imprisonments, but are come to repentance, four years are added to
their former penance.

<span id="xvii.vi-p11"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.vi-p11.1"></span>Canon IV.</span>

<span id="xvii.vi-p12"></span>The case of them who do not repent
pronounced desperate.

<span id="xvii.vi-p13"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.vi-p13.1"></span>Canon V.</span>

<span id="xvii.vi-p14"></span>They that used evasion, and did not right
down subscribe the abnegation, or with their own hands incense the
idols, but sent a heathen to do it for them, are enjoined six months’
penance, though they have been pardoned by some of the Confessors.

<span id="xvii.vi-p15"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.vi-p15.1"></span>Canon VI.</span>

<span id="xvii.vi-p16"></span>Slaves forced by their masters to incense
idols, and doing it in their master’s stead, are enjoined a year’s
penance.

<span id="xvii.vi-p17"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.vi-p17.1"></span>Canon VII.</span>

<span id="xvii.vi-p18"></span>The masters who forced them to it, are
enjoined three years’ penance, as being hypocrites, and as forcing their
slaves to sacrifice.

<span id="xvii.vi-p19"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.vi-p19.1"></span>Canon VIII.</span>

<span id="xvii.vi-p20"></span>They who first fell, and afterwards
recovered themselves, by professing themselves Christians, and endured
torments, are forthwith admitted to communion.

<span id="xvii.vi-p21"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.vi-p21.1"></span>Canon IX.</span>

<span id="xvii.vi-p22"></span>That they who provoked the magistrates to
persecute themselves and others are to be blamed, yet not to be denied
communion.

<span id="xvii.vi-p23"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.vi-p23.1"></span>Canon X.</span>

<span id="xvii.vi-p24"></span>That clergymen, who run themselves into
persecution, and fell, though they did afterward recover themselves, and
suffer torments, yet are not to be admitted to perform the sacred
offices.

<span id="xvii.vi-p25"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.vi-p25.1"></span>Canon XI.</span>

<span id="xvii.vi-p26"></span>That they who prayed for them who fell
after long torments, be connived at, and we pray together with them,
since they lament for what they have done, with anguish and
mortification. <span id="fr_586"></span>[587](#fn_586)

<span id="xvii.vi-p28"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.vi-p28.1"></span>Canon XII.</span>

<span id="xvii.vi-p29"></span>That they who with money purchased their
ease and freedom, are to be commended.

<span id="xvii.vi-p30"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.vi-p30.1"></span>Canon XIII.</span>

<span id="xvii.vi-p31"></span>Nor should we accuse those who ran away,
and left all, though others left behind might fare the worse for
it. <span id="fr_587"></span>[588](#fn_587)

<span id="xvii.vi-p33"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.vi-p33.1"></span>Canon XIV.</span>

<span id="xvii.vi-p34"></span>That they who endured tortures, and
afterwards, when they were deprived of speech and motion, had their
hands forced into the fire, to offer unholy sacrifice, be placed in the
Liturgy \[i.e., in the diptychs\] among the Confessors.

<span id="xvii.vi-p35"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.vi-p35.1"></span>Canon XV.</span>

<span id="xvii.vi-p36"></span>Wednesday is to be fasted, because then
the Jews conspired to betray Jesus; Friday, because he then suffered for
us.  We keep the Lord’s Day as a day of joy, because then our Lord
rose.  Our tradition is, not to kneel on that day.
