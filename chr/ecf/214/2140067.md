id="viii.iii.iii.vi-p1.1"></span>Canon VI.</span>

<span id="viii.iii.iii.vi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.vi-p2.1"></span>Concerning</span> those who have
yielded merely upon threat of penalties and of the confiscation of their
goods, or of banishment, and have sacrificed, and who till this present
time have not repented nor been converted, but who now, at the time of
this synod, have approached with a purpose of conversion, it is decreed
that they be received as hearers till the Great Day, and that after the
Great Day they be prostrators for three years, and for two years more
communicate without oblation, and then come to full communion, so as to
complete the period of six full years.  And if any have been admitted to
penance before this synod, let the beginning of the six years be
reckoned to them from that time.  Nevertheless, if there should be any
danger or prospect of death whether from disease or any other cause, let
them be received, but under limitation.

<span id="viii.iii.iii.vi-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.vi-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon VI.</span>

<span id="viii.iii.iii.vi-p5"></span>A man who yielded to threats alone,
and has sacrificed, and then repented let him for five years be a
prostrator.

<span id="viii.iii.iii.vi-p7"></span>But should any of those debarred
from communion as penitents be seized with illness or in any other way
be brought nigh to <span id="page_66">p. 66</span> <span
id="viii.iii.iii.vi-Page_66"></span>death, they may be received to
communion; but in accordance with this law or distinction, that if they
escape death and recover their health, they shall be altogether deprived
again of communion until they have finished their six years penance.

<span id="viii.iii.iii.vi-p9"></span>“The Great Day,” that is, Easter
Day.  The great reverence which the Primitive Church from the earliest
ages felt for the holy festival of Easter is manifested by the
application of the epithet Great, to everything connected with it.  The
preceding Friday, i.e., Good Friday, was called the Great Preparation,
the Saturday, the Great Sabbath, and the whole week, the Great Week.
