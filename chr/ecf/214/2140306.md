<span id="xi.vi-p3"></span>(L. and C., *Conc*., Tom. IV., col. 343.)

<span id="xi.vi-p4"></span>And when these letters \[i.e. Cyril’s letter
to Nestorius <span class="Greek"><span
id="xi.vi-p4.1"></span>Καταφλυαροῦσι</span> and his letter to John of
Antioch <span class="Greek"><span
id="xi.vi-p4.2"></span>Εὐφραινέσθωσαν\]</span> had been read, the most
reverend bishops cried out:  We all so believe:  Pope Leo thus
believes:  anathema to him who divides and to him who confounds:  this
is the faith of Archbishop Leo:  Leo thus believes:  Leo and Anatolius
so believe:  we all thus believe.  As Cyril so believe we, all of us: 
eternal be the memory of Cyril:  as the epistles of Cyril teach such is
our mind, such has been our faith:  such is our faith:  this is the mind
of Archbishop Leo, so he believes, so he has written.

<span id="xi.vi-p5"></span>The most glorious judges and the great senate
said:  Let there be read also the epistle of the most worthy Leo,
Archbishop of Old Rome, the Imperial City.

<span id="xi.vi-p6"></span>Beronician, the most devout clerk of the
sacred consistory, read from a book handed him by Aëtius, Archdeacon of
the holy Church of Constantinople, the encyclical or synodical letter of
the most holy Leo, the Archbishop, written to Flavian, Archbishop of
Constantinople.
