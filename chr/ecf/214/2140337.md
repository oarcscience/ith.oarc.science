id="xi.xviii.xix-p2.1"></span>Whereas</span> it has come to our ears
that in the provinces the Canonical Synods of Bishops are not held, and
that on this account many ecclesiastical matters which need reformation
are neglected; therefore, according to the canons of the holy Fathers,
the holy Synod decrees that the bishops of every province shall twice in
the year assemble together where the bishop of the Metropolis shall
approve, and shall then settle whatever matters may have arisen.  And
bishops, who do not attend, but remain in their own cities, though they
are in good health and free from any unavoidable and necessary business,
shall receive a brotherly admonition.

<span id="xi.xviii.xix-p5"></span>Twice each year the Synod shall be
held whereever the bishop of the Metropolis shall designate, and all
matters of pressing interest shall be determined.

<span id="xi.xviii.xix-p8"></span>Hilary of Arles and his suffragans,
assembled at Riez, had already, in 439 qualified the provision for two
by adding significantly “if the times are quiet” (Mansi, v., 1194).  The
words were written at the close of ten years’ war, during which the
Visigoths of Septimania “were endeavouring to take Arles and Narbonne”
(Hodgkin, *Italy and her Invaders*, ii., 121).

<span id="xi.xviii.xix-p9"></span>This canon is found in the *Corpus
Juris Canonici*, Gratian’s *Decretum*, Pars I., Dist. XVIII., canon vj.
