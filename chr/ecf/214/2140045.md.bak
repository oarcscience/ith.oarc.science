<span id="vii.vi.xxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="vii.vi.xxvii-p1.1"></span>Canon XVIII.</span>

<span id="vii.vi.xxvii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="vii.vi.xxvii-p2.1"></span>It</span> has come to the knowledge of the
holy and great Synod that, in some districts and cities, the deacons
administer the Eucharist to the presbyters, whereas neither canon nor
custom permits that they who have no right to offer should give the Body
of Christ to them that do offer.  And this also has been made known,
that certain deacons now touch the Eucharist even before the bishops. 
Let all such practices be utterly done away, and let the deacons remain
within their own bounds, knowing that they are the ministers of the
bishop and the inferiors of the presbyters.  Let them receive the
Eucharist according to their order, after the presbyters, and let either
the bishop or the presbyter administer to them.  Furthermore, let not
the deacons sit among the presbyters, for that is contrary to canon and
order.  And if, after this decree, any one shall refuse to obey, let him
be deposed from the diaconate.

<span id="vii.vi.xxvii-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="vii.vi.xxvii-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XVIII.</span>

<span id="vii.vi.xxvii-p5"></span>Deacons must abide within their own
bounds.  They shall not administer the Eucharist to presbyters, nor
touch it before them, nor sit among the presbyters.  For all this is
contrary to canon, and to decent order.

<span id="vii.vi.xxvii-p7"></span>Four excesses of deacons this canon
condemns, at least indirectly.  The first was that they gave the holy
Communion to presbyters.  To understand more easily the meaning of the
canon it must be remembered that the reference here is not to the
presbyters who were sacrificing at the altar but to those who were
offering together with the bishop who was sacrificing; by a rite not
unlike that which to-day takes place, when the newly ordained presbyters
or bishops celebrate mass with the ordaining bishop; and this rite in
old times was of daily occurrence, for a full account of which see
Morinus *De SS. Ordinat*. P. III. Exercit. viij.…The present canon does
not take away from deacons the authority to distribute the Eucharist to
laymen, or to the minor clergy, but only reproves their insolence and
audacity in presuming to administer to presbyters who were
concelebrating with the bishop or another presbyter.…

<span id="vii.vi.xxvii-p8"></span>The second abuse was that certain
deacons touched the sacred gifts before the bishop.  The vulgar version
of Isidore reads for “touched” “received,” a meaning which Balsamon and
Zonaras also adopt, and unless the Greek word, which signifies “to
touch,” is contrary to this translation, it seems by no means to be
alien to the context of the canon.

<span id="vii.vi.xxvii-p9"></span>“Let them receive the Eucharist
according to their order, after the presbyters, and let the bishop or
the presbyter administer to them.”  In these words it is implied that
some deacons had presumed to receive Holy Communion before the
presbyters, and this is the third excess of the deacon which is
condemned by the Synod.

<span id="vii.vi.xxvii-p10"></span>And lastly, the fourth excess was
that they took a place among the presbyters at the very time of the
sacrifice, or “at the holy altar,” as Balsamon observes.

<span id="vii.vi.xxvii-p11"></span>From this canon we see that the
Nicene fathers entertained no doubt that the faithful in the holy
Communion truly received “the body of Christ.”  Secondly, that that was
“offered” in the church, which is the word by which sacrifice is
designated in the New Testament, and therefore it was at that time a
fixed tradition that there was a sacrifice in which the body of Christ
was offered.  Thirdly that not to all, nor even to deacons, but only to
bishops and presbyters was given the power of offering.  And lastly,
that there was recognized a fixed hierarchy in the Church, made up of
bishops and presbyters and deacons in subordination to these.

<span id="vii.vi.xxvii-p12"></span>Of course even at that early date
there was nothing new in this doctrine of the Eucharist.  St. Ignatius
more than a century and a half before, wrote as follows:  “But mark ye
those who hold strange doctrine touching the grace of Jesus Christ which
came to us, how that they are contrary to the mind of God.  They have no
care for love, none for the widow, none for the orphan, none for the
afflicted, none for the prisoner, none for the hungry or thirsty.  They
abstain from eucharist (thanksgiving) and prayer, because they allow not
that the Eucharist is the flesh of our Saviour Jesus Christ, which flesh
suffered for our sins, and which the Father of his goodness raised
up.” <span id="fr_99"></span>[100](#fn_99.md)

<span id="vii.vi.xxvii-p14"></span>In one point the learned scholiast
just quoted has most seriously understated his case.  He says that the
wording of the canon shews “that the Nicene fathers entertained no doubt
that the faithful in the holy Communion truly received ‘the body of
Christ.’”  Now this statement is of course true because it is included
in what the canon says, but the doctrinal statement which is necessarily
contained in the canon is that “the body of Christ is given” by the
minister to the faithful.  This doctrine is believed by all Catholics
and by Lutherans, but is denied by all other Protestants; those
Calvinists who kept most nearly to the ordinary Catholic phraseology
only admitting that “the sacrament of the Body of Christ” was given in
the supper by the minister, while “the body of Christ,” they taught, was
present only in the soul of the worthy communicant (and in no way
connected with the form of bread, which was but the divinely appointed
sign and assurance of the heavenly gift), and therefore could not be
“given” by the priest. <span id="fr_100"></span>[101](#fn_100.md)

<span id="vii.vi.xxvii-p16"></span>This canon is found in the *Corpus
Juris Canonici*, *Decretum*. Pars I. Dist. XCIII., c. xiv.
