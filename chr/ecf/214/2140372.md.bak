id="xiii.vii-p2.1"></span>Session VIII.</span>

<span id="xiii.vii-p3"></span>(Labbe and Cossart, *Concilia*, Tom. VI.,
col. 730.)

<span id="xiii.vii-p4"></span>\[*The Emperor said*\]

<span id="xiii.vii-p5"></span>Let George, the most holy archbishop of
this our God-preserved city, and let Macarius, the venerable archbishop
of Antioch, and let the synod subject to them \[i.e., their suffragans\]
say, if they submit to the force (<span class="Greek"><span
id="xiii.vii-p5.1"></span>εἰ στοιχοῦσι τῇ δυνάμει</span>) of the
suggestions sent by the most holy Agatho Pope of Old <span
id="fr_331"></span>[332](#fn_331.md) Rome and by his Synod.

<span id="xiii.vii-p7"></span>\[*The answer of George, with which all
his bishops, many of them, speaking one by one, agreed except Theodore
of Metilene* (*who handed in his assent at the end of the Tenth
Session*).\]

<span id="xiii.vii-p8"></span>I have diligently examined the whole force
of the suggestions sent to your most pious Fortitude, as well by Agatho,
the most holy Pope of Old <span id="fr_332"></span>[333](#fn_332.md) Rome,
as by his synod, and I have scrutinized the works of the holy and
approved Fathers, which are laid up in my venerable patriarchate, and I
have found that all the testimonies of the holy and accepted Fathers,
which are contained in those suggestions agree with, and in no
particular differ from, the holy and accepted Fathers.  Therefore I give
my submission to them and thus I profess and believe.

<span id="xiii.vii-p10"></span>\[*The answer of all the rest of the
Bishops subject to the See of Constantinople*.  (Col. 735<span
id="xiii.vii-p10.1"></span>.)\]

<span id="xiii.vii-p11"></span>And we, most pious Lord, accepting the
teaching of the suggestion sent to your most gentle Fortitude by the
most holy and blessed Agatho, Pope of Old Rome, and of that other
suggestion which was adopted by the council subject to him, and
following the sense therein contained, so we are minded, so we profess,
and so we believe that in our one Lord Jesus Christ, our true God, there
are two natures unconfusedly, unchangeably, undividedly, and two natural
wills and two natural operations; and all who have taught, and who now
say, that there is but one will and one operation in the two natures of
our one Lord Jesus Christ our true God, we anathematize.

<span id="xiii.vii-p12"></span>\[*The Emperor’s demand to Macarius*. 
(Col. 739<span id="xiii.vii-p12.1"></span>.)\]

<span id="xiii.vii-p13"></span>Let Macarius, the Venerable Archbishop of
Antioch, who has now heard what has been said by this holy and
Ecumenical Synod \[demanding the expression of his faith\], answer what
seemeth him good.

<span id="xiii.vii-p14"></span>\[*The answer of Macarius*.\]

<span id="xiii.vii-p15"></span>I do not say that there are two wills or
two operations in the dispensation of the incarnation of our Lord Jesus
Christ, but one will and one theandric operation.
