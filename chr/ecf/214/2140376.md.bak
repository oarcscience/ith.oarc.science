id="xiii.xi-p1.1"></span>The Prosphoneticus to the Emperor.</span>

<span id="xiii.xi-p2"></span>(Labbe and Cossart, *Concilia*, Tom. VI.,
col. 1047 *et seqq*.)

<span id="xiii.xi-p3"></span>\[*This address begins with many
compliments to the Emperor, especially for his zeal for the true
faith*.\]

<span id="xiii.xi-p4"></span>But because the adversary Satan allows no
rest, he has raised up the very ministers of Christ against him, as if
armed and carrying weapons, etc.

<span id="xiii.xi-p5"></span>\[*The various heretics are then named and
how they were condemned by the preceding five councils is set forth*.\]

<span id="xiii.xi-p6"></span>Things being so, it was necessary that your
beloved of Christ majesty should gather together this all holy, and
numerous assembly.

<span id="xiii.xi-p7"></span>          •          •          •         
•          •          •          •          •          •          •

<span id="xiii.xi-p8"></span>Thereafter being inspired by the Holy
Ghost, and all agreeing and consenting together, and giving our approval
to the doctrinal letter of our most blessed and exalted pope, Agatho,
which he sent to your mightiness, as also agreeing to the suggestion of
the holy synod of one hundred and twenty-five fathers held under him, we
teach that one of the Holy Trinity, our Lord Jesus Christ, was
incarnate, and must be celebrated in two perfect natures without
division and without confusion.  For as the Word, he is consubstantial
and eternal with God his father; but as taking flesh of the immaculate
Virgin Mary, the Mother of God, he is perfect man, consubstantial with
us and made in time.  We declare therefore that he is perfect in Godhead
and that the same is perfect likewise in manhood, according to the
pristine tradition of the fathers and the divine definition of
Chalcedon.

<span id="xiii.xi-p9"></span>And as we recognize two natures, so also we
recognize two natural wills and two natural operations.  For we dare not
say that either of the natures which are in Christ in his incarnation is
without a will and operation:  lest in taking away the proprieties of
those natures, we likewise take away the natures of which they are the
proprieties.  For we neither deny the natural will of his humanity, or
its natural operation:  lest we also deny what is the chief thing of the
dispensation for our salvation, and lest we attribute passions to the
Godhead.  For this they were attempting who have recently introduced the
detestable novelty that in him there is but one will and one operation,
renewing the malignancy of Arius, Apollinaris, Eutyches and Severus. 
For should we say that the human nature of our Lord is without will and
operation, how could we affirm in safety the perfect humanity?  For
nothing else constitutes the integrity of human nature except the
essential will, through which the strength of free-will is marked in us;
and this is also the case with the substantial operation.  For how shall
we call him perfect in humanity if he in no wise suffered and acted as a
man?  For like as the union of two natures preserves for us one
subsistence without confusion and without division; so this one
subsistence, shewing itself in two natures, demonstrates as its own what
things belong to each.

<span id="xiii.xi-p10"></span>Therefore we declare that in him there are
two natural wills and two natural operations, proceeding commonly and
without division:  but we cast out of the Church and rightly subject to
anathema all superfluous novelties as well as their inventors:  to wit,
Theodore of Pharan, Sergius and Paul, Pyrrhus, and Peter (who were
archbishops of Constantinople), moreover Cyrus, who bore the priesthood
of Alexandria, and with them Honorius, who was the ruler (<span
class="Greek"><span id="xiii.xi-p10.1"></span>πρόεδρον</span>) of Rome,
as he followed them in these things.  Besides these, with the best of
cause we anathematize and depose Macarius, who was bishop of Antioch,
and his disciple Stephen (or rather we should say master), who tried to
defend the impiety of their predecessors, and in short stirred up the
whole world, and by their pestilential letters and by their fraudulent
institutions devastated multitudes in every direction.  Likewise also
that old man Polychronius, with an infantile intelligence, who promised
he would raise the dead and who when they did not rise, was laughed at;
and all who have taught, or do teach, or shall presume <span
id="page_348">p. 348</span> <span id="xiii.xi-Page_348"></span>to teach
one will and one operation in the incarnate Christ.…But the highest
prince of the Apostles fought with us:  for we had on our side his
imitator and the successor in his see, who also had set forth in his
letter the mystery of the divine word (<span class="Greek"><span
id="xiii.xi-p10.2"></span>θεολογίας</span>).  For the ancient city of
Rome handed thee a confession of divine character, and a chart from the
sunsetting raised up the day of dogmas, and made the darkness manifest,
and Peter spoke through Agatho, and thou, O autocratic King, according
to the divine decree, with the Omnipotent Sharer of thy throne, didst
judge.

<span id="xiii.xi-p11"></span> •          •          •         
•          •          •          •          •          •          •

<span id="xiii.xi-p12"></span>But, O benign and justice-loving Lord, do
thou in return do this favour to him who hath bestowed thy power upon
thee; and give, as a seal to what has been defined by us, thy imperial
ratification in writing, and so confirm them with the customary pious
edicts and constitutions, that no one may contradict the things which
have been done, nor raise any fresh question.  For rest assured, O
serene majesty, that we have not falsified anything defined by the
Ecumenical Councils and by the approved fathers, but we have confirmed
them.  And now we all cry out with one mind and one voice, “O God, save
the King! etc., etc.”

<span id="xiii.xi-p13"></span>\[*Then follow numerous compliments to the
Emperor and prayers for his preservation*.\]
