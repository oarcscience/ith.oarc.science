union divide the hypostases in the one Christ, joining them by that
connexion alone, which happens according to worthiness, or even
authority and power, and not rather by a coming together (<span
class="Greek"><span id="x.ix.iv-p2.2"></span>συνόδῳ</span>), which is
made by natural union (<span class="Greek"><span
id="x.ix.iv-p2.3"></span>ἕνωσιν φυσικὴν</span>):  let him be anathema.

<span id="x.ix.iv-p5"></span>III.

<span id="x.ix.iv-p6"></span>If any one says that Christ, who is also
Emmanuel, is One, not \[merely\] in consequence of *connection*, but
\[also\] in *nature*, and does not acknowledge the *connection* (<span
class="Greek"><span id="x.ix.iv-p6.1"></span>συνάφεια</span>) of the two
natures, that of the Logos and of the assumed manhood, in one Son, as
still continuing without mingling; let him be anathema.

<span id="x.ix.iv-p8"></span>(*Hist. of the Counc*., Vol. III., p. 7.)

<span id="x.ix.iv-p9"></span>Theodore \[of Mopsuestia, and in this he
was followed by Nestorius,\] (and here is his fundamental error,) not
merely maintained the existence of two *natures* in Christ, but of two
*persons*, as, he says himself, no subsistence can be thought of as
perfect without personality.  As however, he did not ignore the fact
that the consciousness of the Church rejected such a double personality
in Christ, he endeavoured to get rid of the difficulty, and he
repeatedly says expressly:  “The two natures united together make only
one Person, as man and wife are only one flesh.…If we consider the
natures in their distinction, we should define the nature of the Logos
as perfect and complete, and so also his Person, and again the nature
and the person of the man as perfect and complete.  If, on the other
hand, we have regard to the union (<span class="Greek"><span
id="x.ix.iv-p9.1"></span>συνάφεια</span>), we say it is one Person.” 
The very illustration of the union of man and wife shows that Theodore
did not suppose a true union of the two natures in Christ, but that his
notion was rather that of an external connection of the two.  The
expression <span class="Greek"><span
id="x.ix.iv-p9.2"></span>συνάφεια</span>, moreover, which he selected
here instead of the term <span class="Greek"><span
id="x.ix.iv-p9.3"></span>ἕνωσιν</span>, which he elsewhere employs,
being derived from <span class="Greek"><span
id="x.ix.iv-p9.4"></span>συνάπτω</span> \[to join together\], expresses
only an external connection, a fixing together, and is therefore
expressly rejected in later times by the doctors of the Church.  And
again, Theodore designates a merely external connection also in the
phrase already quoted, to the effect that “the Logos dwells in the man
assumed as in a temple.”  As a temple and the statue set up within it
are one whole merely in outward appearance, so the Godhead and manhood
in Christ appear only from without in their actuality as one Person,
while they remain essentially two Persons.
