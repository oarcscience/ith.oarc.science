<span id="xvii.xvi-p3"></span>A letter to Gregory, an unmarried priest,
charging him to dismiss a woman whom he kept, though he was 70 years of
age, and declared himself free from all amorous affections; and St.
Basil would seem to believe him in this particular; but cites the III.
canon of Nice against this practice, bids him avoid scandal, place the
woman in a monastery, and be attended by men:  he threatens him that if
he does not comply, he shall die suspended from his office, and give
account to God:  that he shall be an anathema to all the people, and
they who receive him \[to communion\] be excommunicated.
