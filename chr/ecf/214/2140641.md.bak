id="xv.iv.iv.cxviii-p1.1"></span>Canon CXVII.  (Greek cxviii.)</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxviii-p2"></span>Of peoples converted from the
Donatists.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxviii-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.cxviii-p3.1"></span>Item</span>, it seemed good, since it
was so decreed some years ago by a plenary council, that whatever
churches were erected in a diocese before the laws were made concerning
Donatists when they became Catholic, should pertain to the sees of those
bishops through whom their return to Catholic unity was brought about;
but after the laws whatever churches communicated were to belong there
where they belonged when they were Donatists.  But because many
controversies afterward arose and are still springing up between bishops
concerning dioceses, which were not then at all in prospect, now it has
seemed good to this council, that wherever there was a Catholic and a
Donatist party, pertaining to different sees, at whatever time unity has
been or shall be made, whether before or after the laws, the churches
shall belong to that see to which the Catholic church which was already
there belonged.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxviii-p6"></span>Whenever conversions and unions of
Donatists are effected, let them be subject to that throne to which the
Catholic Church which was formerly there was subject.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxviii-p7"></span>This is Canon ix. of Carthage,
