id="xiv.iii.xxxv-p2.1"></span>But</span> in future, since the priestly
canon openly sets this forth, that the crime of conspiracy or secret
society is forbidden by external laws, but much more ought it to be
prohibited in the Church; we also hasten to observe that if any clerics
or monks are found either conspiring or entering secret societies, or
devising anything against bishops or clergymen, they shall be altogether
deprived of their rank.

<span id="xiv.iii.xxxv-p5"></span>If clerics or monks enter into
conspiracies or fraternities, or plots against the bishop or their
fellow clerics, they shall be cast out of their grade.
