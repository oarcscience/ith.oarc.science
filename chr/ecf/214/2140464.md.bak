id="xiv.iii.lxxxi-p2.1"></span>If</span> any bishop, or presbyter, or
deacon, or any of those who are enumerated in the list of the clergy, or
a layman, has no very grave necessity nor difficult business so as to
keep him from church for a very long time, but being in town does not go
to church on three consecutive Sundays—three weeks—if he is a cleric let
him be deposed, but if a layman let him be cut off.

<span id="xiv.iii.lxxxi-p5"></span>If anyone without the constraint of

Sardica (xiv. according to the numbering of Dionysius Exiguus.)
