id="xv.iv.iv.lii-p1.1"></span>Canon LI.  (Greek lv.)</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.lii-p2"></span>That the date of Easter is to be
announced by the Church of Carthage.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.lii-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.lii-p3.1"></span>Honoratus</span> and Urban, the bishops,
said:  Since all things treated by our commonitory are known, <span
id="fr_452"></span>[453](#fn_452.md) we add also what has been ordered
concerning the day of Easter, that we be informed of the date always by
the Church of Carthage, as has been accustomed and that no short time
before.  Aurelius, the bishop, said:  If it seems good to your holiness,
since we remember that we pledged ourselves sometime ago that every year
we would come together for discussion, when we assemble, then let the
date of the holy Easter be announced through the legates present at the
Council.  Honoratus and Urban, the bishops, said:  Now we seek of the
present assembly that ye deign to inform our province of that day by
letters.  Aurelius, the bishop, said:  It is necessary it should be so.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.lii-p4"></span> The Latin “noscuntur” is almost
certainly corrupt, Van Espen suggests “absoluta sunt” as the meaning.
