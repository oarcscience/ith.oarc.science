<span id="xvi.xviii.iii-p1"></span> III.  *Contents of the Caroline
Books*.

<span id="xvi.xviii.iii-p2"></span>If the authorship and authority of
these books are difficult subjects, the contents of the books are still
more extraordinary, for it seems to be certain, past all possibility of
doubt, that the authors of these books had never read the acts nor
decrees of the Seventh Ecumenical Synod, of which they were writing; and
further that he or they were also completely ignorant of what took place
at the Conciliabulum of 754.

<span id="xvi.xviii.iii-p3"></span>One example will be sufficient to
prove this point.  In Book IV., Chapter XIV., and also in chapter XX.,
(Migne’s ed., col. 1213 and col. 1226), the charge is made that the
Seventh Council, especially Gregory, the bishop of Neocæsarea, unduly
flattered the Empress.  Now as a matter of fact the remarks referred to
were made at the Conciliabulum of 754, and not at the Second Council of
Nice; they were not made by Gregory of Neocæsarea at all, and the reason
they are attributed to him is because he read them in the proceedings of
that pseudo-council to the true council of 787.

<span id="xvi.xviii.iii-p4"></span>Other examples could easily be given,
but this is sufficient.  *Ab uno disce omnes*.  The most famous however
of all the ignorant blunders found in these books must not here be
omitted.  It occurs in Book III., chapter xvij., and is no less serious
than to attribute to Constantius, the bishop of Cyprus, the monstrous
statement that the sacred images were to be given the supreme adoration
due to the Holy Trinity.  What a complete mistake this was, we have
already pointed out, and will have been evident to anyone who has read
the extracts of the acts given in the foregoing pages.  I have said
“mistake;” and I have said so deliberately, because I am convinced that
the Caroline books, the decree of Frankfort, and the decision of the
Convention of Paris, all sprung from ignorance and blundering; and
largely through the force of this particular false statement on which I
am writing.  But I must not omit the statement of Sir William Palmer, a
champion of these books, that “the acts of the synod of Nice having been
sent to Rome in the year 787, Pope Hadrian himself, according to
Hincmar, transmitted them into France to Charlemagne, to be confirmed by
the bishops of his kingdom; and the Emperor \[i.e. Charlemagne\] also
received the acts directly from Constantinople according to Roger
Hovedon.  These prelates, thus furnished with an authentic copy and not
a mere translation, composed a reply to the synod” (*Treatise on the
Church*, Vol. II., p. 203).

<span id="xvi.xviii.iii-p5"></span>If Sir William is right, then the
author of the Caroline books is thrown into a dark shade indeed, for
either he was too ignorant or too careless to read the original Greek,
or else, knowing the real state of the case, deliberately misrepresented
the synod.  Sir William feels this difficulty, and, a few lines below
the sentence I have quoted, attributes the misstatements to a
“mistranslation,” viz. the false statement—upon which alone all the rest
hung—attributed to the bishop of Cyprus.  But the two claims are
*contraria inter se*.  If they were using an authentic copy of the
original sent from Constantinople then they could not have been misled
by a “mistranslation;” if they used a mistranslation and took no pains
to read the decrees, their opinion and their writings—as well as the
decrees which followed <span id="page_580">p. 580</span> <span
id="xvi.xviii.iii-Page_580"></span>from them—were evidently entirely
without theological value, and this is the estimation in which they have
been held by all unprejudiced scholars without exception, whether
agreeing with their conclusions or no.

<span id="xvi.xviii.iii-p6"></span>It will be well to set plainly before
the reader the foundation upon which rests the dogmatic teaching of the
Caroline Books.  This is, in short, the authority of the Roman See. 
That there may be no possible doubt upon this point, I proceed to quote
somewhat at length chapter vi., of Book I.; the heading of which reads
as follows:  “That the Holy Roman Catholic and Apostolic Church is
placed above all other Churches, and is to be consulted at every turn
when any controversy arises with regard to the faith.”

<span id="xvi.xviii.iii-p7"></span>“Before entering upon a discussion of
the witnesses which the Easterns have absurdly brought forward in their
Synod, we think well to set forth how greatly the holy Roman Church has
been exalted by the Lord above the other Churches, and how she is to be
consulted by the faithful:  and this is especially the case since only
such books as she receives as canonical and only such Fathers as she has
recognized by Gelasius and the other Pontiffs, his successors, are to be
accepted and followed; nor are they to be interpreted by the private
will of anyone, but wisely and soberly.…For as the Apostolic Sees in
general are to be preferred to all the other dioceses of the world, much
more is that see to be preferred which is placed over all the other
apostolic sees.  For just as the Apostles were exalted above the other
disciples, and Peter was exalted above the other Apostles, so the
apostolic sees are exalted above the other sees, and the Roman See is
eminent over the other apostolic sees.  And this exaltation arises from
no synodical action of the other Churches, but she holds the primacy
(*primatum*) by the authority of the Lord himself, when he said, ‘Thou
art Peter, etc.’…

<span id="xvi.xviii.iii-p8"></span>“This church, therefore, fortified
with the spiritual arms of the holy faith, and satiated with the
health-giving fountains which flow from the well of light and from the
source of goodness, resists the horrible and atrocious monsters of
heresies, and ministers the honey-sweet cups of teaching to the Catholic
Churches of the whole world.…Whence \[i.e. from St. Jerome consulting
the Pope\] we can understand how Saints and learned men who were shining
lights in different parts of the world, not only did not depart in faith
from the holy Roman Church, but also asked aid of her in time of
necessity for the strengthening of the faith.  And this all Catholic
Churches should regularly observe, so that they may seek help from her,
after Christ, for protecting the faith:  which (*quæ*) having neither
spot nor wrinkle, smites the portentous heads of heresies, and
strengthens the minds of the faithful in the faith.  And although many
have separated from this holy and venerable communion, nevertheless
never have the Churches of our part done so, but instructed by that
apostolical erudition, and by his assistance from whom cometh every good
and perfect gift, have always received the venerable charismata…; and
are careful to follow the see of blessed Peter in all things, as they
desire thither to arrive where he sits as keeper of the keys.  To which
blessedness may he who deigned to found his Church upon Peter bring us,
and make us to persevere in the unity of the holy Church; and may we
merit a place in that kingdom of heaven through the intervention of him
whose See we follow and to whom have been given the keys.”

<span id="xvi.xviii.iii-p9"></span>Such is the doctrinal foundation of
the Caroline books, viz.:  the absolute authority of the Roman See in
matters pertaining to the faith of the Church.  It is certainly very
difficult to understand how the author of these books could have known
that the doctrinal decree of the Synod of Nice had received the
approbation of this supreme power which it was so necessary to consult
and defer to; and that the Synod which he denounces and rejects had been
received by that chief of all the Apostolic Sees as the Seventh of the
Ecumenical Councils of the Catholic Church.

<span id="xvi.xviii.iii-p10"></span><span id="page_581">p. 581</span>
<span id="xvi.xviii.iii-Page_581"></span>Whether the author \[or
authors\] had ever seen the Pope’s letter or no, one thing is certain,
he never read with any care even the imperfect translation with which he
had been furnished, and of that translation Anastasius Bibliothetius
says:  “The translator both misunderstood the genius of the Greek
language as well as that of the Latin, and has merely translated word
for word; and in such a fashion that it is scarcely ever possible to
know (*aut vix aut nunquam*) what it means; moreover nobody ever reads
this translation and no copies of it are made.” <span
id="fr_547"></span>[548](#fn_547.md)

<span id="xvi.xviii.iii-p12"></span>This being the case, when we come to
examine the Caroline Books, we are not astonished to find them full of
false statements.

<span id="xvi.xviii.iii-p13"></span>In the Preface we are told that the
Conciliabulum was “held in Bithynia;” of course as a matter of fact it
met in Constantinople.

<span id="xvi.xviii.iii-p14"></span>In Bk. I., chapter j., we find
certain words said to occur in the letters of the Empress and her son. 
On this Hefele remarks:  “One cannot find the words in either of the two
letters of these sovereigns, which are preserved in the acts of the
Council of Nice, it is the synod that uses them. <span
id="fr_548"></span>[549](#fn_548.md) ”

<span id="xvi.xviii.iii-p16"></span>In the Second Book, chapter xxvij.,
the council is charged with saying “Just as the Lord’s body and blood
pass over from fruits of the earth to a notable mystery, so also the
images, made by the skill of the artificers, pass over to the veneration
of those persons whose images they bear.”  Now this was never said nor
taught by the Nicene Synod, but something like it was taught by the
Constantinopolitan conciliabulum of 754; but the very words cited occur
neither in the one set of acts nor in the other!  The underlying thought
however was, as we have said, clearly exposed by the iconoclastic synod
of 754 and as clearly refuted by the orthodox synod of 787.

<span id="xvi.xviii.iii-p17"></span>In Book III., chapter V., we are
told that “Tarasius said in his confession of faith that the Holy Spirit
was the companion (*contribulum* in the Caroline Books) of the Father
and of the Son.”  It was not Tarasius who said so at all, but Theodore
of Jerusalem, and in using the word <span class="Greek"><span
id="xvi.xviii.iii-p17.1"></span>ὁ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="xvi.xviii.iii-p17.2"></span>μόφυλος</span> he was but copying
Sophronius of Jerusalem.

<span id="xvi.xviii.iii-p18"></span>Chapter XVII. begins thus:  “How
rashly and (so to speak) like a fool, Constantine, bishop of Constantia
in Cyprus, spoke when he said, with the approval of the rest of the
bishops, that he would receive and honourably embrace the images; and
babbled that the service of adoration which is due to the consubstantial
and life-giving Trinity, should be given images, we need not here
discuss, since to all who either read or hear this it will be clear that
he was swamped in no small error, to wit to confess that he exhibited to
creatures the service due to the Creator alone, and through his desire
to favour the pictures overturned all the Holy Scriptures.  For what
sane man ever either said or thought of saying such an absurdity, as
that different pictures should be held in the same honour as the holy,
victorious Trinity, the creator of all things, etc.”  But as will be
seen by a glance at the acts this is exactly the opposite of what
Constantine did say.  Now if, as Sir William Palmer asserts, the author
had before him the genuine acts in the original, I do not see how his
honesty can be defended, or if his honesty is kept intact, it must be at
the expense of his learning or carefulness.  Bower felt this so keenly
that he thinks the Caroline Books attribute the words to Constantine the
bishop alone and not to the council.  But the subterfuge is vain, for,
as we have just seen, the author affirms that Constantine’s speech
received “the assent of the rest of the bishops (*cæteris
consentientibus*),” and further not obscurely suggests that Constantine
had the courage to say what the others were content to think, but did
not dare to say.

<span id="xvi.xviii.iii-p19"></span>In Book IV., the third chapter
distinctly states that while lights and incense were used <span
id="page_582">p. 582</span> <span id="xvi.xviii.iii-Page_582"></span>by
them in their churches, yet that neither the one nor the other was
placed before images.  If this can be relied upon it would seem to fix
the Frankish custom of that date.

<span id="xvi.xviii.iii-p20"></span>Chapters XIV. and XX. are
distinguished by the most glaring blunders, for they attribute to the
Council of Nice the teachings of the Conciliabulum, and in particular
they lay them to the door of Gregory of Neocæsarea because he it was who
read them.

<span id="xvi.xviii.iii-p21"></span>Finally, in chapter the
twenty-eighth, the ecumenical character of II. Nice is denied, on the
ground that it has not preserved the faith of the Fathers, and that it
was not universal in its constitution.  I beg the reader, who has fresh
in his memory the Papal claims set forth in a previous chapter, to
consider whether it is possible that the author of that chapter should
have seen and known of the Papal acceptance of the Seventh Synod and yet
have written as follows:  “Among all the inanities said and done by this
synod, this does not seem by any means to be the least, that they styled
it ecumenical, for it neither held the purity of the ecumenical faith,
nor did it obtain authority through the ecumenical action of the
Churches.…If this synod had kept clear of novelties and had rested
satisfied with the teachings of the ancient Fathers, it might have been
styled ecumenical.  But since it was not contented with the teachings of
the ancient Fathers it cannot be styled ecumenical,” etc., etc.

<span id="xvi.xviii.iii-p22"></span>Such are in brief the contents and
spirit of the Caroline Books.  Binius indeed says that he found a
twenty-ninth chapter in a French <span class="sc"><span
id="xvi.xviii.iii-p22.1"></span>ms.</span> of Hadrian’s Epistle.  It is
lacking in the ordinary codices.  Petavius thinks it was added by the
Council of Frankfort.  It is found in Migne (col. 1218) and the main
point is that St. Gregory’s advice is to be followed, viz.:  “We permit
images of the Saints to be made by whoever is so disposed, as well in
churches as out of them, for the love of God and of his Saints; but
never compel anyone who does not wish to do so to bow to them (*adorare
eas*); nor do we permit anyone to destroy them, even if he should so
desire.”  I cannot but think that this would be a very lame conclusion
to all the denunciation of the preceding chapters.
