<span id="xiv.iii.lxxiv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.lxxiv-p2.1"></span>Since</span> the life-giving cross has
shewn to us Salvation, we should be careful that we render due honour to
that by which we were saved from the ancient fall.  Wherefore, in mind,
in word, in feeling giving veneration (<span class="Greek"><span
id="xiv.iii.lxxiv-p2.2"></span>προσκύνησιν</span>) to it, we command
that the figure of the cross, which some have placed on the floor, be
entirely removed therefrom, lest the trophy of the victory won for us be
desecrated by the trampling under foot of those who walk over it. 
Therefore those who from this present represent on the pavement the sign
of the cross, we decree are to be cut off.

id="xiv.iii.lxxiv-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon LXXIII.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.lxxiv-p5"></span>If there is a cross upon a pavement
it must be removed.

<span id="xiv.iii.lxxiv-p6"></span>This canon defines that to the image
of the cross is to be “given veneration (<span class="Greek"><span
id="xiv.iii.lxxiv-p6.1"></span>προσκύνησις</span>) of the intellect, of
the words, and of the sense,” i.e., the cross is to be venerated with
the interior cultus of the soul, is to be venerated with the exterior
culture of praise, and also with sensible acts, such as kissings,
bowings, etc.
