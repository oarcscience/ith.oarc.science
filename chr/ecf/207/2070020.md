<span id="ii.viii-p2"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="ii.viii-p2.1"></span>On the Ten <span
id="fr_637"></span>[638](#fn_637.md) Points of Doctrine.</span>

<span id="ii.viii-p4"></span><span id="ii.viii-p4.1"></span><span
class="sc"><span id="ii.viii-p4.2"></span>[Colossians ii.
8](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#008.md)<span
id="ii.viii-p4.3"></span></span>.

<span id="ii.viii-p5"></span>Beware lest any man spoil you through
philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the
rudiments of the world, &c.

<span id="ii.viii-p6"></span>1.  <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.viii-p6.1"></span>Vice</span> mimics virtue, and the tares strive
to be thought wheat, growing like the wheat in appearance, but being
detected by good judges from the taste.  *The devil also transfigures
himself into an angel of light* <span id="fr_638"></span>[639](#fn_638.md)
; not that he may reascend to where he was, for having made *his heart
hard as an anvil* <span id="fr_639"></span>[640](#fn_639.md) , he has
henceforth a will that cannot repent; but in order that he may envelope
those who are living an Angelic life in a mist of blindness, and a
pestilent condition of unbelief.  Many wolves are going about *in
sheeps’ clothing* <span id="fr_640"></span>[641](#fn_640.md) , their
clothing being that of sheep, not so their claws and teeth:  but clad in
their soft skin, and deceiving the innocent by their appearance, they
shed upon them from their fangs the destructive poison of ungodliness. 
We have need therefore of divine grace, and of a sober mind, and of eyes
that see, lest from eating tares as wheat we suffer harm from ignorance,
and lest from taking the wolf to be a sheep we become his prey, and from
supposing the destroying Devil to be a beneficent Angel we be devoured: 
for, as the Scripture saith, *he goeth about as a roaring lion, seeking
whom he may devour* <span id="fr_641"></span>[642](#fn_641.md) .  This is
the cause of the Church’s admonitions, the cause of the present
instructions, and of the lessons which are read.

<span id="ii.viii-p11"></span>2.  For the method of godliness consists
of these two things, pious doctrines, and virtuous practice:  and
neither are the doctrines acceptable to God apart from good works, nor
does God accept the works which are not perfected with pious doctrines. 
For what profit is it, to know well the doctrines concerning God, and
yet to be a vile fornicator?  And again, what profit is it, to be nobly
temperate, and an impious blasphemer?  A most precious possession
therefore is the knowledge of doctrines:  also there is need of a
wakeful soul, since there are many *that make spoil through philosophy
and vain deceit* <span id="fr_642"></span>[643](#fn_642.md) .  The Greeks
on the one hand draw men away by their smooth tongue, *for honey
droppeth from a harlot’s lips* <span id="fr_643"></span>[644](#fn_643.md)
:  whereas they of the Circumcision deceive those who come to them by
means of the Divine Scriptures, which they miserably misinterpret though
*studying them from childhood to old age* <span
id="fr_644"></span>[645](#fn_644.md) , and growing old in ignorance.  But
the children of heretics, *by their good words and smooth tongue,
deceive the hearts of the innocent* <span
id="fr_645"></span>[646](#fn_645.md) , disguising with the name of Christ
as it were with honey the poisoned arrows <span
id="fr_646"></span>[647](#fn_646.md) of their impious doctrines: 
concerning all of whom together the Lord saith, Take heed lest any man
mislead you <span id="fr_647"></span>[648](#fn_647.md) .  This is the
reason for the teaching of the Creed and for expositions upon it.

<span id="ii.viii-p18"></span>3.  But before delivering you over to the
Creed <span id="fr_648"></span>[649](#fn_648.md) , I think it is well to
make use at present of a short summary of necessary doctrines; that the
multitude of things to be spoken, and the long interval of the days of
all this holy Lent, may not cause forgetfulness in the mind of the more
simple among you; but that, having strewn some seeds now in a summary
way, we may not forget the same when afterwards more widely tilled.  But
let those here present whose habit of mind is mature, and <span
id="page_20">p. 20</span> <span id="ii.viii-Page_20"></span>who *have
their senses already exercised to discern good and evil* <span
id="fr_649"></span>[650](#fn_649.md) , endure patiently to listen to things
fitted rather for children, and to an introductory course, as it were,
of milk:  that at the same time both those who have need of the
instruction may be benefited, and those who have the knowledge may
rekindle the remembrance of things which they already know.

<span id="ii.viii-p21"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="ii.viii-p21.1"></span>I.  Of God.</span>

<span id="ii.viii-p22"></span>4.  First then let there be laid as a
foundation in your soul the doctrine concerning God; that God is One,
alone unbegotten, without beginning, change, or variation <span
id="fr_650"></span>[651](#fn_650.md) ; neither begotten of another, nor
having another to succeed Him in His life; who neither began to live in
time, nor endeth ever:  and that He is both good and just; that if ever
thou hear a heretic say, that there is one God who is just, and another
who is good <span id="fr_651"></span>[652](#fn_651.md) , thou mayest
immediately remember, and discern the poisoned arrow of heresy.  For
some have impiously dared to divide the One God in their teaching:  and
some have said that one is the Creator and Lord of the soul, and another
of the body <span id="fr_652"></span>[653](#fn_652.md) ; a doctrine at once
absurd and impious.  For how can a man become the one servant of two
masters, when our Lord says in the Gospels, *No man can serve two
masters* <span id="fr_653"></span>[654](#fn_653.md) ?  There is then One
Only God, the Maker both of souls and bodies:  One the Creator of heaven
and earth, the Maker of Angels and Archangels:  of many the Creator, but
of One only the Father before all ages,—of One only, His Only-begotten
Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, by Whom He made *all things visible and
invisible* <span id="fr_654"></span>[655](#fn_654.md) .

<span id="ii.viii-p28"></span>5.  This Father of our Lord Jesus Christ
is not circumscribed in any place <span
id="fr_655"></span>[656](#fn_655.md) , nor is He less than the heaven; *but
the heavens are the works of His fingers* <span
id="fr_656"></span>[657](#fn_656.md) , and *the whole earth is held in His
grasp* <span id="fr_657"></span>[658](#fn_657.md) :  He is in all things
and around all.  Think not that the sun is brighter than He <span
id="fr_658"></span>[659](#fn_658.md) , or equal to Him:  for He who at
first formed the sun must needs be incomparably greater and brighter. 
He foreknoweth the things that shall be, and is mightier than all,
knowing all things and doing as He will; not being subject to any
necessary sequence of events, nor to nativity, nor chance, nor fate; in
all things perfect, and equally possessing every absolute form <span
id="fr_659"></span>[660](#fn_659.md) of virtue, neither diminishing nor
increasing, but in mode and conditions ever the same; who hath prepared
punishment for sinners, and a crown for the righteous.

<span id="ii.viii-p34"></span>6.  Seeing then that many have gone astray
in divers ways from the One God, some having deified the sun, that when
the sun sets they may abide in the night season without God; others the
moon, to have no God by day <span id="fr_660"></span>[661](#fn_660.md) ;
others the other parts of the world <span
id="fr_661"></span>[662](#fn_661.md) ; others the arts <span
id="fr_662"></span>[663](#fn_662.md) ; others their various kinds of
food <span id="fr_663"></span>[664](#fn_663.md) ; others their
pleasures <span id="fr_664"></span>[665](#fn_664.md) ; while some, mad
after women, have set up on high an image of a naked woman, and called
it Aphrodite <span id="fr_665"></span>[666](#fn_665.md) , and worshipped
their own lust in a visible form; and others dazzled by the brightness
of gold have deified it <span id="fr_666"></span>[667](#fn_666.md) and the
other kinds of matter;—whereas if one lay as a first foundation in his
heart the doctrine of the unity <span id="fr_667"></span>[668](#fn_667.md)
of God, and trust to Him, he roots out at once the whole crop <span
id="fr_668"></span>[669](#fn_668.md) of the evils of idolatry, and of the
error of the heretics:  lay thou, therefore, this first doctrine of
religion as a foundation in thy soul by faith.

<span id="ii.viii-p44"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="ii.viii-p44.1"></span>Of Christ.</span>

<span id="ii.viii-p45"></span>7.  Believe also in the Son of God, One
and Only, our Lord Jesus Christ, Who was be<span id="page_21">p.
21</span> <span id="ii.viii-Page_21"></span>gotten God of God, begotten
Life of Life, begotten Light of Light <span
id="fr_669"></span>[670](#fn_669.md) , Who is in all things like <span
id="fr_670"></span>[671](#fn_670.md) to Him that begat, Who received not
His being in time, but was before all ages eternally and
incomprehensibly begotten of the Father:  The Wisdom and the Power of
God, and His Righteousness personally subsisting <span
id="fr_671"></span>[672](#fn_671.md) :  Who sitteth on the right hand of
the Father before all ages.

<span id="ii.viii-p49"></span>For the throne at God’s right hand He
received not, as some have thought, because of His patient endurance,
being crowned as it were by God after His Passion; but throughout His
being,—a being by eternal generation <span
id="fr_672"></span>[673](#fn_672.md) ,—He holds His royal dignity, and
shares the Father’s seat, being God and Wisdom and Power, as hath been
said; reigning together with the Father, and creating all things for the
Father, yet lacking nothing in the dignity of Godhead, and knowing Him
that hath begotten Him, even as He is known of Him that hath begotten;
and to speak briefly, remember thou what is written in the Gospels, that
*none knoweth the Son but the Father, neither knoweth any the Father
save the Son* <span id="fr_673"></span>[674](#fn_673.md) .

<span id="ii.viii-p52"></span>8.  Further, do thou neither
separate <span id="fr_674"></span>[675](#fn_674.md) the Son from the
Father, nor by making a confusion believe in a Son-Fatherhood <span
id="fr_675"></span>[676](#fn_675.md) ; but believe that of One God there is
One Only-begotten Son, who is before all ages God the Word; not the
uttered <span id="fr_676"></span>[677](#fn_676.md) word diffused into the
air, nor to be likened to impersonal words <span
id="fr_677"></span>[678](#fn_677.md) ; but the Word the Son, Maker of all
who partake of reason, the Word who heareth the Father, and Himself
speaketh.  And on these points, should God permit, we will speak more at
large in due season; for we do not forget our present purpose to give a
summary introduction to the Faith.

<span id="ii.viii-p58"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="ii.viii-p58.1"></span>Concerning His Birth of the Virgin.</span>

<span id="ii.viii-p59"></span>9.  Believe then that this Only-begotten
Son of God for our sins came down from heaven upon earth, and took upon
Him this human nature of like passions <span
id="fr_678"></span>[679](#fn_678.md) with us, and was begotten of the Holy
Virgin and of the Holy Ghost, and was made Man, not in seeming and mere
show <span id="fr_679"></span>[680](#fn_679.md) , but in truth; nor yet by
passing through the Virgin as through a channel <span
id="fr_680"></span>[681](#fn_680.md) ; but was of her made truly flesh,
\[and truly nourished with milk <span id="fr_681"></span>[682](#fn_681.md)
\], and did truly eat as we do, and truly drink as we do.  For if the
Incarnation was a phantom, salvation is a phantom also.  The Christ was
of two natures, Man in what was seen, but God in what was not seen; as
Man truly eating like us, for He had the like feeling of the flesh with
us; but as God feeding the five thousand from five loaves; as Man truly
dying, but as God raising him that had been dead four days; truly
sleeping in the ship as Man, and walking upon the waters as God.

<span id="ii.viii-p64"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="ii.viii-p64.1"></span>Of the Cross.</span>

<span id="ii.viii-p65"></span>10.  He was truly crucified for our sins. 
For if thou wouldest deny it, the place refutes thee visibly, this
blessed Golgotha <span id="fr_682"></span>[683](#fn_682.md) , in which we
are now assembled for the sake of Him who was here crucified; and the
whole world has since been filled with pieces of the wood of the
Cross <span id="fr_683"></span>[684](#fn_683.md) .  But He was crucified
not for sins of His own, but that we might be delivered from *our*
sins.  And though as Man He was at that time *despised of men*, and was
buffeted, yet He was acknowledged by the Creation as God:  for when the
sun saw his Lord dishonoured, he grew dim and trembled, not enduring the
sight.

<span id="ii.viii-p68"></span><span id="page_22">p. 22</span> <span
id="ii.viii-Page_22"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="ii.viii-p68.1"></span>Of His Burial.</span>

<span id="ii.viii-p69"></span>11.  He was truly laid as Man in a tomb of
rock; but rocks were rent asunder by terror because of Him.  He went
down into the regions beneath the earth, that thence also He might
redeem the righteous <span id="fr_684"></span>[685](#fn_684.md) .  For,
tell me, couldst thou wish the living only to enjoy His grace, and that,
though most of them are unholy; and not wish those who from Adam had for
a long while been imprisoned to have now gained their liberty?  Esaias
the Prophet proclaimed with loud voice so many things concerning Him;
wouldst thou not wish that the King should go down and redeem His
herald?  David was there, and Samuel, and all the Prophets <span
id="fr_685"></span>[686](#fn_685.md) , John himself also, who by his
messengers said, *Art thou He that should come, or look we for
another* <span id="fr_686"></span>[687](#fn_686.md) ?  Wouldst thou not
wish that He should descend and redeem such as these?

<span id="ii.viii-p73"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="ii.viii-p73.1"></span>Of the Resurrection.</span>

<span id="ii.viii-p74"></span>12.  But He who descended into the regions
beneath the earth came up again; and Jesus, who was buried, truly rose
again the third day.  And if the Jews ever worry thee, meet them at once
by asking thus:  Did Jonah come forth from the whale on the third day,
and hath not Christ then risen from the earth on the third day?  Is a
dead man raised to life on touching the bones of Elisha, and is it not
much easier for the Maker of mankind to be raised by the power of the
Father?  Well then, He truly rose, and after He had risen was seen again
of the disciples:  and twelve disciples were witnesses of His
Resurrection, who bare witness not in pleasing words, but contended even
unto torture and death for the truth of the Resurrection.  What then,
*shall every word be established at the mouth of two of three
witnesses* <span id="fr_687"></span>[688](#fn_687.md) , according to the
Scripture, and, though twelve bear witness to the Resurrection of
Christ, art thou still incredulous in regard to His Resurrection?

<span id="ii.viii-p76"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="ii.viii-p76.1"></span>Concerning the Ascension.</span>

<span id="ii.viii-p77"></span>13.  But when Jesus had finished His
course of patient endurance, and had redeemed mankind from their sins,
He ascended again into the heavens, a cloud receiving Him up:  and as He
went up Angels were beside Him, and Apostles were beholding.  But if any
man disbelieves the words which I speak, let him believe the actual
power of the things now seen.  All kings when they die have their power
extinguished with their life:  but Christ crucified is worshipped by the
whole world.  We proclaim The Crucified, and the devils tremble now. 
Many have been crucified at various times; but of what other who was
crucified did the invocation ever drive the devils away?

<span id="ii.viii-p78"></span>14.  Let us, therefore, not be ashamed of
the Cross of Christ; but though another hide it, do thou openly seal it
upon thy forehead, that the devils may behold the royal sign and flee
trembling far away <span id="fr_688"></span>[689](#fn_688.md) .  Make then
this sign at eating and drinking, at sitting, at lying down, at rising
up, at speaking, at walking:  in a word, at every act <span
id="fr_689"></span>[690](#fn_689.md) .  For He who was here crucified is in
heaven above.  If after being crucified and buried He had remained in
the tomb, we should have had cause to be ashamed; but, in fact, He who
was crucified on Golgotha here, has ascended into heaven from the Mount
of Olives on the East.  For after having gone down hence into Hades, and
come up again to us, He ascended again from us into heaven, His Father
addressing Him, and saying, *Sit Thou on My right hand, until I make
Thine enemies Thy footstool* <span id="fr_690"></span>[691](#fn_690.md) .

<span id="ii.viii-p82"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="ii.viii-p82.1"></span>Of Judgment to Come.</span>

<span id="ii.viii-p83"></span>15.  This Jesus Christ who is gone up
shall come again, not from earth but from heaven:  and I say, “not from
earth,” because there are many Antichrists to come at this time from
earth.  For already, as thou hast seen, many have begun to say, *I am
the Christ* <span id="fr_691"></span>[692](#fn_691.md) :  and *the
abomination of desolation* <span id="fr_692"></span>[693](#fn_692.md) is
yet to come, assuming to himself the false title of Christ.  But look
thou for the true Christ, the Only-begotten Son of God, coming
henceforth no more from earth, but from heaven, appearing to all more
bright than any lightning and brilliancy of light, with angel guards
attended, that He may judge both quick and dead, and reign in a
heavenly, eternal kingdom, which shall have no end.  For on this point
also, I pray thee, make thyself sure, since there are many who say that
Christ’s Kingdom hath an end <span id="fr_693"></span>[694](#fn_693.md) .

<span id="ii.viii-p87"></span><span id="page_23">p. 23</span> <span
id="ii.viii-Page_23"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="ii.viii-p87.1"></span>Of the Holy Ghost.</span>

<span id="ii.viii-p88"></span>16.  Believe thou also in the Holy Ghost,
and hold the same opinion concerning Him, which thou hast *received to
hold* concerning the Father and the Son, and follow not those who teach
blasphemous things of Him <span id="fr_694"></span>[695](#fn_694.md) .  But
learn thou that this Holy Spirit is One, indivisible, of manifold power;
having many operations, yet not Himself divided; Who knoweth the
mysteries, Who *searcheth all things, even the deep things of God* <span
id="fr_695"></span>[696](#fn_695.md) :  Who descended upon the Lord Jesus
Christ in form of a dove; Who wrought in the Law and in the Prophets;
Who now also at the season of Baptism sealeth thy soul; of Whose
holiness also every intellectual nature hath need:  against Whom *if any
dare to blaspheme, he hath no forgiveness, neither in this world, nor in
that which is to come* <span id="fr_696"></span>[697](#fn_696.md) :  “Who
with the Father and the Son together <span
id="fr_697"></span>[698](#fn_697.md) ” is honoured with the glory of the
Godhead:  of Whom also *thrones, and dominions, principalities, and
powers* have need <span id="fr_698"></span>[699](#fn_698.md) .  For there
is One God, the Father of Christ; and One Lord Jesus Christ, the
Only-begotten Son of the Only God; and One Holy Ghost, the sanctifier
and deifier of all <span id="fr_699"></span>[700](#fn_699.md) , Who spake
in the Law and in the Prophets, in the Old and in the New Testament.

<span id="ii.viii-p95"></span>17.  Have thou ever in thy mind this
seal <span id="fr_700"></span>[701](#fn_700.md) , which for the present has
been lightly touched in my discourse, by way of summary, but shall be
stated, should the Lord permit, to the best of my power with the proof
from the Scriptures.  For concerning the divine and holy mysteries of
the Faith, not even a casual statement must be delivered without the
Holy Scriptures; nor must we be drawn aside by mere plausibility and
artifices of speech.  Even to me, who tell thee these things, give not
absolute credence, unless thou receive the proof of the things which I
announce from the Divine Scriptures.  For this salvation which we
believe depends not on ingenious reasoning <span
id="fr_701"></span>[702](#fn_701.md) , but on demonstration of the Holy
Scriptures.

<span id="ii.viii-p98"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="ii.viii-p98.1"></span>Of the Soul.</span>

<span id="ii.viii-p99"></span>18.  Next to the knowledge of this
venerable and glorious and all-holy Faith, learn further what thou
thyself art:  that as man thou art of a two-fold nature, consisting of
soul and body; and that, as was said a short time ago, the same God is
the Creator both of soul and body <span
id="fr_702"></span>[703](#fn_702.md) .  Know also that thou hast a soul
self-governed, the noblest work of God, made after the image of its
Creator <span id="fr_703"></span>[704](#fn_703.md) :  immortal because of
God that gives it immortality; a living being, rational, imperishable,
because of Him that bestowed these gifts:  having free power to do what
it willeth <span id="fr_704"></span>[705](#fn_704.md) .  For it is not
according to thy nativity that thou sinnest, nor is it by the power of
chance that thou committest fornication, nor, as some idly talk, do the
conjunctions of the stars compel thee to give thyself to
wantonness <span id="fr_705"></span>[706](#fn_705.md) .  Why dost thou
shrink from confessing thine own evil deeds, and ascribe the blame to
the innocent stars?  Give no more heed, pray, to astrologers; for of
these the divine Scripture saith, *Let the stargazers of the heaven
stand up and save thee*, and what follows:  *Behold, they all shall be
consumed as stubble on the fire, and shall not deliver their soul from
the flame* <span id="fr_706"></span>[707](#fn_706.md) .

<span id="ii.viii-p105"></span>19.  And learn this also, that the soul,
before it came into this world, had committed no sin <span
id="fr_707"></span>[708](#fn_707.md) , but having come in sinless, we now
sin of our free-will.  Listen not, I pray thee, to any one perversely
interpreting the words, *But if I do that which I would not* <span
id="fr_708"></span>[709](#fn_708.md) :  but remember Him who saith, *If ye
be willing, and hearken unto Me, ye shall eat the good things of the
land:  but if ye be not willing, neither hearken unto Me, the sword
shall devour you, &c.* <span id="fr_709"></span>[710](#fn_709.md) :  and
again, *As ye presented your members as servants to uncleanness and to
iniquity unto iniquity, even so now present your members as servants to
righteousness unto sanctification* <span
id="fr_710"></span>[711](#fn_710.md) .  Remember also the Scripture, which
saith, *Even as they did not like to retain God in their
knowledge* <span id="fr_711"></span>[712](#fn_711.md) :  and, *That which
may be known of God is mani*<span id="page_24">p. 24</span> <span
id="ii.viii-Page_24"></span>*festin them* <span
id="fr_712"></span>[713](#fn_712.md) ; and again, *their eyes they have
closed* <span id="fr_713"></span>[714](#fn_713.md) .  Also remember how God
again accuseth them, and saith, *Yet I planted thee a fruitful vine,
wholly true:  how art thou turned to bitterness, thou the strange
vine* <span id="fr_714"></span>[715](#fn_714.md) ?

<span id="ii.viii-p114"></span>20.  The soul is immortal, and all souls
are alike both of men and women; for only the members of the body are
distinguished <span id="fr_715"></span>[716](#fn_715.md) .  There is not a
class of souls sinning by nature, and a class of souls practising
righteousness by nature <span id="fr_716"></span>[717](#fn_716.md) :  but
both act from choice, the substance of their souls being of one kind
only, and alike in all.  I know, however, that I am talking much, and
that the time is already long:  but what is more precious than
salvation?  Art thou not willing to take trouble in getting provisions
for the way against the heretics?  And wilt thou not learn the bye-paths
of the road, lest from ignorance thou fall down a precipice?  If thy
teachers think it no small gain for thee to learn these things,
shouldest not thou the learner gladly receive the multitude of things
told thee?

<span id="ii.viii-p117"></span>21.  The soul is self-governed:  and
though the devil can suggest, he has not the power to compel against the
will.  He pictures to thee the thought of fornication:  if thou wilt,
thou acceptest it; if thou wilt not, thou rejectest.  For if thou wert a
fornicator by necessity, then for what cause did God prepare hell?  If
thou were a doer of righteousness by nature and not by will, wherefore
did God prepare crowns of ineffable glory?  The sheep is gentle, but
never was it crowned for its gentleness:  since its gentle quality
belongs to it not from choice but by nature.

<span id="ii.viii-p118"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="ii.viii-p118.1"></span>Of the Body.</span>

<span id="ii.viii-p119"></span>22.  Thou hast learned, beloved, the
nature of the soul, as far as there is time at present:  now do thy best
to receive the doctrine of the body also.  Suffer none of those who say
that this body is no work of God <span id="fr_717"></span>[718](#fn_717.md)
:  for they who believe that the body is independent of God, and that
the soul dwells in it as in a strange vessel, readily abuse it to
fornication <span id="fr_718"></span>[719](#fn_718.md) .  And yet what
fault have they found in this wonderful body?  For what is lacking in
comeliness?  And what in its structure is not full of skill?  Ought they
not to have observed the luminous construction of the eyes?  And how the
ears being set obliquely receive the sound unhindered?  And how the
smell is able to distinguish scents, and to perceive exhalations?  And
how the tongue ministers to two purposes, the sense of taste, and the
power of speech?  How the lungs placed out of sight are unceasing in
their respiration of the air?  Who imparted the incessant pulsation of
the heart?  Who made the distribution into so many veins and arteries? 
Who skilfully knitted together the bones with the sinews?  Who assigned
a part of the food to our substance, and separated a part for decent
secretion, and hid away the unseemly members in more seemly places?  Who
when the human race must have died out, rendered it by a simple
intercourse perpetual?

<span id="ii.viii-p122"></span>23.  Tell me not that the body is a cause
of sin <span id="fr_719"></span>[720](#fn_719.md) .  For if the body is a
cause of sin, why does not a dead body sin?  Put a sword in the right
hand of one just dead, and no murder takes place.  Let beauties of every
kind pass before a youth just dead, and no impure desire arises.  Why? 
Because the body sins not of itself, but the soul through the body.  The
body is an instrument, and, as it were, a garment and robe of the soul: 
and if by this latter it be given over to fornication, it becomes
defiled:  but if it dwell with a holy soul, it becomes a temple of the
Holy Ghost.  It is not I that say this, but the Apostle Paul hath said,
*Know ye not, that your bodies are the temple of the Holy Ghost which is
in you* <span id="fr_720"></span>[721](#fn_720.md) ?  Be tender, therefore,
of thy body as being a temple of the Holy Ghost.  Pollute not thy flesh
in fornication:  defile not this thy fairest robe:  and if ever thou
hast defiled it, now cleanse it by repentance:  get thyself washed,
while time permits.

<span id="ii.viii-p125"></span>24.  And to the doctrine of chastity let
the first to give heed be the order of Solitaries <span
id="fr_721"></span>[722](#fn_721.md) and of Virgins, who maintain the
angelic life in the world; and let the rest of the Church’s people
follow them.  For you, brethren, a great crown is laid up:  barter not
away a great dignity for a petty pleasure:  listen to the Apostle
speaking:  *Lest there be any fornicator or profane person, as Esau, who
for one mess of* <span id="page_25">p. 25</span> <span
id="ii.viii-Page_25"></span>*meat sold his own birthright* <span
id="fr_722"></span>[723](#fn_722.md) .  Enrolled henceforth in the Angelic
books for thy profession of chastity, see that thou be not blotted out
again for thy practice of fornication.

<span id="ii.viii-p128"></span>25.  Nor again, on the other hand, in
maintaining thy chastity be thou puffed up against those who walk in the
humbler path of matrimony.  For as the Apostle saith, *Let marriage be
had in honour among all, and let the bed be undefiled* <span
id="fr_723"></span>[724](#fn_723.md) .  Thou too who retainest thy
chastity, wast thou not begotten of those who had married?  Because thou
hast a possession of gold, do not on that account reprobate the silver. 
But let those also be of good cheer, who being married use marriage
lawfully; who make a marriage according to God’s ordinance, and not of
wantonness for the sake of unbounded license; who recognise seasons of
abstinence, *that they may give themselves unto prayer* <span
id="fr_724"></span>[725](#fn_724.md) ; who in our assemblies bring clean
bodies as well as clean garments into the Church; who have entered upon
matrimony for the procreation of children, but not for indulgence.

<span id="ii.viii-p131"></span>26.  Let those also who marry but once
not reprobate those who have consented to a second marriage <span
id="fr_725"></span>[726](#fn_725.md) :  for though continence is a noble
and admirable thing, yet it is also permissible to enter upon a second
marriage, that the weak may not fall into fornication.  For *it is good
for them*, saith the Apostle, *if they abide even as I.  But if they
have not continency, let them marry:  for it is better to marry than to
burn* <span id="fr_726"></span>[727](#fn_726.md) .  But let all the other
practices be banished afar, fornication, adultery, and every kind of
licentiousness:  and let the body be kept pure for the Lord, that the
Lord also may have respect unto the body.  And let the body be nourished
with food, that it may live, and serve without hindrance; not, however,
that it may be given up to luxuries.

<span id="ii.viii-p134"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="ii.viii-p134.1"></span>Concerning Meats.</span>

<span id="ii.viii-p135"></span>27.  And concerning food let these be
your ordinances, since in regard to meats also many stumble.  For some
deal indifferently with things offered to idols <span
id="fr_727"></span>[728](#fn_727.md) , while others discipline themselves,
but condemn those that eat:  and in different ways men’s souls are
defiled in the matter of meats, from ignorance of the useful reasons for
eating and not eating.  For we fast by abstaining from wine and flesh,
not because we abhor them as abominations, but because we look for our
reward; that having scorned things sensible, we may enjoy a spiritual
and intellectual feast; and that *having now sown in tears we may reap
in joy* <span id="fr_728"></span>[729](#fn_728.md) in the world to come. 
Despise not therefore them that eat, and because of the weakness of
their bodies partake of food:  nor yet blame these who *use a little
wine for their stomach’s sake and their often infirmities* <span
id="fr_729"></span>[730](#fn_729.md) :  and neither condemn the men as
sinners, nor abhor the flesh as strange food; for the Apostle knows some
of this sort, when he says:  *forbidding to marry, and commanding to
abstain from meats, which God created to be received with thanksgiving
by them that believe* <span id="fr_730"></span>[731](#fn_730.md) .  In
abstaining then from these things, abstain not as from things
abominable <span id="fr_731"></span>[732](#fn_731.md) , else thou hast no
reward:  but as being good things disregard them for the sake of the
better spiritual things set before thee.

<span id="ii.viii-p141"></span>28.  Guard thy soul safely, lest at any
time thou eat of things offered to idols:  for concerning meats of this
kind, not only I at this time, but ere now Apostles also, and James the
bishop of this Church, have had earnest care:  and the Apostles and
Elders write a Catholic epistle to all the Gentiles, that they should
*abstain* first *from things offered to idols, and* then *from blood*
also *and from things strangled* <span id="fr_732"></span>[733](#fn_732.md)
.  For many men being of savage nature, and living like dogs, both lap
up blood <span id="fr_733"></span>[734](#fn_733.md) , in imitation of the
manner of the <span id="page_26">p. 26</span> <span
id="ii.viii-Page_26"></span>fiercest beasts, and greedily devour things
strangled.  But do thou, the servant of Christ, in eating observe to eat
with reverence.  And so enough concerning meats.

<span id="ii.viii-p144"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="ii.viii-p144.1"></span>Of Apparel.</span>

<span id="ii.viii-p145"></span>29.  But let thine apparel be plain, not
for adornment, but for necessary covering:  not to minister to thy
vanity, but to keep thee warm in winter, and to hide the unseemliness of
the body:  lest under pretence of hiding the unseemliness, thou fall
into another kind of unseemliness by thy extravagant dress.

<span id="ii.viii-p146"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="ii.viii-p146.1"></span>Of the Resurrection.</span>

<span id="ii.viii-p147"></span>30.  Be tender, I beseech thee, of this
body, and understand that thou wilt be raised from the dead, to be
judged with this body.  But if there steal into thy mind any thought of
unbelief, as though the thing were impossible, judge of the things
unseen by what happens to thyself.  For tell me; a hundred years ago or
more, think where wast thou thyself:  and from what a most minute and
mean substance thou art come to so great a stature, and so much dignity
of beauty <span id="fr_734"></span>[735](#fn_734.md) .  What then?  Cannot
He who brought the non-existent into being, raise up again that which
already exists and has decayed <span id="fr_735"></span>[736](#fn_735.md)
?  He who raises the corn, which is sown for our sakes, as year by year
it dies,—will He have difficulty in raising us up, for whose sakes that
corn also has been raised <span id="fr_736"></span>[737](#fn_736.md) ? 
Seest thou how the trees stand now for many months without either fruit
or leaves:  but when the winter is past they spring up whole into life
again as if from the dead <span id="fr_737"></span>[738](#fn_737.md) : 
shall not we much rather and more easily return to life?  The rod of
Moses was transformed by the will of God into the unfamiliar nature of a
serpent:  and cannot a man, who has fallen into death, be restored to
himself again?

<span id="ii.viii-p152"></span>31.  Heed not those who say that this
body is not raised; for it is raised:  and Esaias is witness, when he
says:  *The dead shall arise, and they that are in the tombs shall
awake* <span id="fr_738"></span>[739](#fn_738.md) :  and according to
Daniel, *Many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall arise,
some to everlasting life, and some to everlasting shame* <span
id="fr_739"></span>[740](#fn_739.md) .  But though to rise again is common
to all men, yet the resurrection is not alike to all:  for the bodies
received by us all are eternal, but not like bodies by all:  for the
just receive them, that through eternity they may join the Choirs of
Angels; but the sinners, that they may endure for ever the torment of
their sins.

<span id="ii.viii-p155"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="ii.viii-p155.1"></span>Of the Laver.</span>

<span id="ii.viii-p156"></span>32.  For this cause the Lord, preventing
us according to His loving-kindness, has granted repentance at
Baptism <span id="fr_740"></span>[741](#fn_740.md) , in order that we may
cast off the chief—nay rather the whole burden of our sins, and having
received the seal by the Holy Ghost, may be made heirs of eternal life. 
But as we have spoken sufficiently concerning the Laver the day before
yesterday, let us now return to the remaining subjects of our
introductory teaching.

<span id="ii.viii-p158"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="ii.viii-p158.1"></span>Of the Divine Scriptures.</span>

<span id="ii.viii-p159"></span>33.  Now these the divinely-inspired
Scriptures of both the Old and the New Testament teach us.  For the God
of the two Testaments is One, Who in the Old Testament foretold the
Christ Who appeared in the New; Who by the Law and the Prophets led us
to Christ’s school.*  For before faith came, we were kept in ward under
the law*, and, *the law hath been our tutor to bring us unto
Christ* <span id="fr_741"></span>[742](#fn_741.md) .  And if ever thou hear
any of the heretics speaking evil of the Law or the Prophets, answer in
the sound of the Saviour’s voice, saying, Jesus *came not to destroy the
Law, but to fulfil it* <span id="fr_742"></span>[743](#fn_742.md) .  Learn
also diligently, and from the Church, what are the books of the Old
Testament, and what those of the New.  And, pray, read none of the
apocryphal writings <span id="fr_743"></span>[744](#fn_743.md) :  for why
dost thou, who knowest not those which are acknowledged among all,
trouble thyself in vain about those which are disputed?  Read the Divine
Scriptures, the twenty-two books of the Old Testament, these that have
been translated by the Seventy-two Interpreters <span
id="fr_744"></span>[745](#fn_744.md) .

<span id="ii.viii-p164"></span><span id="page_27">p. 27</span> <span
id="ii.viii-Page_27"></span>34.  For after the death of Alexander, the
king of the Macedonians, and the division of his kingdom into four
principalities, into Babylonia, and Macedonia, and Asia, and Egypt, one
of those who reigned over Egypt, Ptolemy Philadelphus, being a king very
fond of learning, while collecting the books that were in every place,
heard from Demetrius Phalereus, the curator of his library, of the
Divine Scriptures of the Law and the Prophets, and judged it much
nobler, not to get the books from the possessors by force against their
will, but rather to propitiate them by gifts and friendship; and knowing
that what is extorted is often adulterated, being given unwillingly,
while that which is willingly supplied is freely given with all
sincerity, he sent to Eleazar, who was then High Priest, a great many
gifts for the Temple here at Jerusalem, and caused him to send him six
interpreters from each of the twelve tribes of Israel for the
translation <span id="fr_745"></span>[746](#fn_745.md) .  Then, further, to
make experiment whether the books were Divine or not, he took precaution
that those who had been sent should not combine among themselves, by
assigning to each of the interpreters who had come his separate chamber
in the island called Pharos, which lies over against Alexandria, and
committed to each the whole Scriptures to translate.  And when they had
fulfilled the task in seventy-two days, he brought together all their
translations, which they had made in different chambers without sending
them one to another, and found that they agreed not only in the sense
but even in words.  For the process was no word-craft, nor contrivance
of human devices:  but the translation of the Divine Scriptures, spoken
by the Holy Ghost, was of the Holy Ghost accomplished.

<span id="ii.viii-p166"></span>35.  Of these read the two and twenty
books, but have nothing to do with the apocryphal writings.  Study
earnestly these only which we read openly in the Church.  Far wiser and
more pious than thyself were the Apostles, and the bishops of old time,
the presidents of the Church who handed down these books.  Being
therefore a child of the Church, trench <span
id="fr_746"></span>[747](#fn_746.md) thou not upon its statutes.  And of
the Old Testament, as we have said, study the two and twenty books,
which, if thou art desirous of learning, strive to remember by name, as
I recite them.  For of the Law the books of Moses are the first five,
Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy.  And next, Joshua the
son of Nave <span id="fr_747"></span>[748](#fn_747.md) , and the book of
Judges, including Ruth, counted as seventh.  And of the other historical
books, the first and second books of the Kings <span
id="fr_748"></span>[749](#fn_748.md) are among the Hebrews one book; also
the third and fourth one book.  And in like manner, the first and second
of Chronicles are with them one book; and the first and second of Esdras
are counted one.  Esther is the twelfth book; and these are the
Historical writings.  But those which are written in verses are five,
Job, and the book of Psalms, and Proverbs, and Ecclesiastes, and the
Song of Songs, which is the seventeenth book.  And after these come the
five Prophetic books:  of the Twelve Prophets one book, of Isaiah one,
of Jeremiah one, including Baruch and Lamentations and the Epistle <span
id="fr_749"></span>[750](#fn_749.md) ; then Ezekiel, and the Book of
Daniel, the twenty-second of the Old Testament.

<span id="ii.viii-p171"></span>36.  Then of the New Testament there are
the four Gospels only, for the rest have false titles <span
id="fr_750"></span>[751](#fn_750.md) and are mischievous.  The Manichæans
also wrote a Gospel according to Thomas, which being tinctured with the
fragrance of the evangelic title corrupts the souls of the simple sort. 
Receive also the Acts of the Twelve Apostles; and in addition to these
the seven <span id="page_28">p. 28</span> <span
id="ii.viii-Page_28"></span>Catholic Epistles of James, Peter, John, and
Jude; and as a seal upon them all, and the last work of the disciples,
the fourteen Epistles of Paul <span id="fr_751"></span>[752](#fn_751.md) . 
But let all the rest be put aside in a secondary rank.  And whatever
books are not read in Churches, these read not even by thyself, as thou
hast heard me say.  Thus much of these subjects.

<span id="ii.viii-p174"></span>37.  But shun thou every diabolical
operation, and believe not the apostate Serpent, whose transformation
from a good nature was of his own free choice:  who can over-persuade
the willing, but can compel no one.  Also give heed neither to
observations of the stars nor auguries, nor omens, nor to the fabulous
divinations of the Greeks <span id="fr_752"></span>[753](#fn_752.md) . 
Witchcraft, and enchantment, and the wicked practices of necromancy,
admit not even to a hearing.  From every kind of intemperance stand
aloof, giving thyself neither to gluttony nor licentiousness, rising
superior to all covetousness and usury.  Neither venture thyself at
heathen assemblies for public spectacles, nor ever use amulets in
sicknesses; shun also all the vulgarity of tavern-haunting.  Fall not
away either into the sect of the Samaritans, or into Judaism:  for Jesus
Christ henceforth hath ransomed thee.  Stand aloof from all observance
of Sabbaths <span id="fr_753"></span>[754](#fn_753.md) , and from calling
any indifferent meats *common or unclean*.  But especially abhor all the
assemblies of wicked heretics; and in every way make thine own soul
safe, by fastings, prayers, almsgivings, and reading the oracles of God;
that having lived the rest of thy life in the flesh in soberness and
godly doctrine, thou mayest enjoy the one salvation which flows from
Baptism; and thus enrolled in the armies of heaven by God and the
Father, mayest also be deemed worthy of the heavenly crowns, in Christ
Jesus our Lord, to Whom be the glory for ever and ever.  Amen.

<span id="ii.viii-p24"></span> Irenæus, I. c. xxvii. says that Cerdo
taught that the God of the Law and the Prophets was not the Father of
our Lord Jesus Christ:  for that He is known, but the other unknown, and
the one is just, but the other good.  Also III. c. 25, § 3:  “Marcion
himself, therefore, by dividing God into two, and calling the one good,
and the other judicial, on both sides puts an end to Deity.”  Compare
Tertullian, *c. Marcion*. I. 2, and 6; Origen, *c. Cels*. iv. 54.

<span id="ii.viii-p42"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.viii-p42.1"></span>τῆς μοναρχίας τοῦ θεοῦ</span>.  See note on
the title of Cat. VI.  Praxeas made use of the term “Monarchy” to
exclude the Son (and the Spirit) from the Godhead.  Tertullian in his
treatise against Praxeas maintains the true doctrine that the Son is no
obstacle to the “Monarchy,” because He is of the substance of the
Father, does nothing without the Father’s will, and has received all
power from the Father, to Whom He will in the end deliver up the
kingdom.  In this sense Dionysius, Bishop of Rome, speaks of the Divine
Monarchy as “that most sacred doctrine of the Church of God.”  Compare
Athanas. *de Decretis, Nic. Syn.* c. vi. § 3 and Dr. Newman’s note.  In
*Orat.* iv. *c.* *Arian*. p 606 (617), Athanasius derives the term from

ἐκ τοῦ Πατρὸς ἀνάρχως καὶ ἀϊδίως γεγεννημένον, λόγον δὲ οὐ προφορικόν,
οὐκ ἐνδιάθετον</span>.  Cardinal Newman (*Athan. c. Arianos*, I. 7,
note) observes that some Christian writers of the 2nd Century “seem to
speak of the Divine generation as taking place immediately before the
creation of the world, that is, as if not eternal, though at the same
time they teach that our Lord existed before that generation.  In other
words they seem to teach that He was the Word from eternity, and became
the Son at the beginning of all things; some of them expressly
considering Him, first as the <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.viii-p55.3"></span>λόγος ἐνδιάθετος</span>, or Reason, in the
Father, or (as may be speciously represented) a mere attribute; next, as
the <span class="Greek"><span id="ii.viii-p55.4"></span>λόγος

<span id="ii.viii-p56"></span>The terms <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.viii-p56.1"></span>λόγος ἐνδιάθετος</span>, or ‘word conceived in
the mind,’ and <span class="Greek"><span id="ii.viii-p56.2"></span>λόγος
προφορικός</span>, or ‘word expressed’ (*emissum*, or *prolalivum*),
were in use among the Gnostics (*Iren*. II. c. 12, § 5).  As applied to
the Son both terms, though sometimes used in a right sense, were
condemned as inadequate.  Compare xi. 10.

to Constantinople, where Constantine privately enclosed it in his own

monasteries in Egypt, other countries presently followed the
example.…Hilarion, who was scholar to Antonius, was the first monk that
ever lived in Palestine or Syria.”  Bingham, VII. i. 4.

marriages is in striking contrast with the passionate vehemence of
Tertullian in the treatise *de Monogamia*, and elsewhere.  Aug. *de
Hæresibus*, cc. 26, 38, reckons the condemnation of second marriage
among the heretical doctrines of the Montanists and Cathari.  In the
treatise *de Bono Viduitatis*, c. 6, he argues that a second marriage is
not to be condemned, but is less honourable than widowhood, and severely
rebukes the heretical teaching on this point of Tertullian, the
Montanists, and the Novatians.  *De Bono Conjugali*, c. 21:  Sacramentum
nuptiarum temporis nostri sic ad unum virum et unam uxorem redactum est,
ut Ecclesiæ dispensatorem non liceat ordinare nisi unius uxoris virum.

id="ii.viii-p162.1"></span>τῶν ἀποκρύφων</span>.  The sense in which
Cyril uses this term may be learned from Rufinus (*Expositio Symboli*, §
38), who distinguishes three classes of books:  (1) The Canonical Books
of the Old and New Testaments, which alone are to be used in proof of
doctrine; (2) Ecclesiastical, which may be read in Churches, including
Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus, Tobit, Judith, and the Books of the Maccabees,
in the Old Testament, and *The Shepherd* of Hermas, and *The Two Ways*
in the New Testament; (3) The other writings they called “Apocryphal,”
which they would not have read in Churches.  The distinction is useful,
though the second class is not complete.

id="ii.viii-p162.2"></span>

<span id="ii.viii-p163"></span> The original source of this account of
the Septuagint version is a letter purporting to have been written by
Aristeas, or Aristæus, a confidential minister of Ptolemy Philadelphus,
to his brother Philocrates.  Though the letter is not regarded as
genuine its statements are in part admitted to be true, being confirmed
by a fragment, preserved by Eusebius (*Præparatio Evangelica*, ix. 6.),
of a work of Aristobulus, a Jewish philosopher who wrote in the reign of
Ptolemy Philometor, 181–146, <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.viii-p163.1"></span>b.c.</span>  Upon these testimonies it is
generally admitted that “the whole Law,” i.e. the Pentateuch was
translated into Greek at Alexandria in the reign either of Ptolemy Soter
(323–285, <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.viii-p163.2"></span>b.c.</span>), or of his son Ptolemy
Philadelphus (285–247, <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.viii-p163.3"></span>b.c.</span>), under the direction of
Demetrius Phalereus, curator of the King’s library.

<span id="fn_745"></span>[27:746](2070020.htm#fr_745.md) <span
id="ii.viii-p164.1"></span>

<span id="ii.viii-p165"></span> Up to this point Cyril’s account is
based upon the statements of the Pseudo-Aristeas.  The fabulous
incidents which follow, concerning the separate cells, the completion of
the whole version by each translator, the miraculous agreement in the
very words, proving a Divine inspiration, are found in Philo Judæus,
*Life of Moses*, II. 7.  Josephus, *Antiquities*, XII. *c*. ii. 3–14,
following the letter of Aristeas, gives long descriptions of the
magnificent presents sent by Philadelphus to Jerusalem, and of his
splendid hospitality to the translators, but makes no allusion to the
separate cells or miraculous agreement.  On the contrary he represents
the 72 interpreters as meeting together for consultation, agreeing on
the text to be adopted, and completing their joint labours in 72 days. 
The slightest comparison of the Version with the original Hebrew must
convince any reasonable person that the idea of divine inspiration or
supernatural assistance, borrowed by Justin Martyr, Irenæus, and other
Fathers, apparently from Philo, is a mere invention of the imagination,
disproved by the facts.  Compare the article “Septuagint” in Murray’s

<span id="ii.viii-p167"></span> The rendering “trench not” (<span
class="sc"><span id="ii.viii-p167.1"></span>R.W.C.</span>) agrees well
with the etymology of the verb (<span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.viii-p167.2"></span>παραχαράσσω</span>).  Its more usual
signification seems to be “counterfeit,” “forge.”  The sense required
here, apart from any metaphor, is “transgress” (Heurtley).

<span id="ii.viii-p168"></span> The name “Nun” is represented by “Nave”
in the Septuagint, which Cyril used.

<span id="ii.viii-p170"></span> The Epistle of Jeremy, which now appears
in the Apocrypha as the last chapter of Baruch.  On the number and
arrangement of the Books of the Old and New Testaments the student
should consult an interesting Essay by Professor Sanday (*Studia
Biblica*, vol. iii.), who traces the introduction of a fixed order to
the time when papyrus *rolls* were superseded by *codices*, in which the
sheets of skin were folded and bound together, as in printed books. 
This change had commenced before the Diocletian persecution, <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.viii-p170.1"></span>a.d.</span> 303, when among
the sacred books taken from the Christians *codices* were much more
numerous than *rolls*.  On the contents of the Jewish Canon, see
Dictionary of the Bible, “Canon.”  B.F.W. “Josephus enumerates 20 books
‘which are justly believed to be divine.’”  One of the earliest attempts
by a Christian to ascertain correctly the number and order of the Books
of the O.T. was made by Melito, Bishop of Sardis, who travelled for this
purpose to Palestine, in the latter part of the 2nd Century.  His list
is as follows:—“Of Moses five (books); Genesis, Exodus, Numbers,
Leviticus, Deuteronomy, Jesus son of Nave, Judges, Ruth, four Books of
Kings, two of Chronicles, Psalms of David, Solomon’s Proverbs, which is
also called Wisdom, Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs, Job, Prophets, Isaiah,
Jeremiah, the Twelve in one Book, Daniel, Ezekiel, Esdras.”  (Eusebius,
*H.E.* III. cap. 10, note I, in this series.)  Cyril’s List agrees with
that of Athanasius (*Festal Epistle*, 373 <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.viii-p170.2"></span>a.d.</span>), except that Job is placed by
Ath. after Canticles instead of before Psalms.

many Apocryphal Gospels, see the article by Lipsius in the “*Dictionary
of Christian Biography*,” Smith and Wace, and the English translations
in Clark’s Ante-Nicene Library.

<span id="ii.viii-p173"></span> Cyril includes in this list all the
books which we receive, except the Apocalypse.  See Bishop Westcott’s
Article “Canon,” in the *Dictionary of the Bible*, and Origen’s
Catalogue in Euseb. *Hist.* vi. 25 (Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers, vol.
i.).
