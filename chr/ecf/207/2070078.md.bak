id="iv.ii.v-p1.1"></span>Ep. CXXV.  To Olympius.</span>

<span id="iv.ii.v-p2"></span>Even hoar hairs have something to learn;
and old age, it would seem, cannot in all respects be trusted for
wisdom.  I at any rate, knowing better than anyone, as I did, the
thoughts and the heresy of the Apollinarians, and seeing that their
folly was intolerable; yet thinking that I could tame them by patience
and soften them by degrees, I let my hopes make me eager to attain this
object.  But, as it seems, I overlooked the fact that I was making them
worse, and injuring the Church by my untimely philosophy.  For
gentleness does not put bad men out of countenance.  And now if it had
been possible for me to teach you this myself, I should not have
hesitated, you may be sure, even to undertake a journey beyond my
strength to throw myself at the feet of your Excellency.  But since my
illness has brought me too far, and it has become necessary for me to
try the hot baths of Xanxaris at the advice of my medical men, I send a
letter to represent me.  These wicked and utterly abandoned men have
dared, in addition to all their other misdeeds, either to summon, or to
make a bad use of the passage (I am not prepared to say precisely which)
of certain Bishops, deprived by the whole Synod of the Eastern and
Western Church; and, in violation of all Imperial Ordinances, and of
your commands, to confer the name of Bishop on a certain individual of
their own misbelieving and deceitful crew; encouraged to do so, as I
believe, by nothing so much as my great infirmity; for I must mention
this.  If this is to be tolerated, your Excellency will tolerate it, and
I too will bear it, as I have often before.  But if it is serious, and
not to be endured by our most august Emperors, pray punish what has been
done—though more mildly than such madness merits.
