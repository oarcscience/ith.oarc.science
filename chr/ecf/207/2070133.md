<span id="iv.iv.v.i-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.iv.v.i-p1.1"></span>§5. To Amphilochius the Younger.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.v.i-p2"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="iv.iv.v.i-p2.1"></span>Ep. IX.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.v.i-p3"></span>(Constantine and Constantius had granted
exemption from the military tax to all clerics.  This privilege was,
however, abolished by Julian, and was restored by Valentinian and
Valens:  but the collectors of revenue often tried to levy it on them in
spite of the exemption.  The collector at Nazianzus tried to do this in
the case of a Deacon named Euthalius, in whose behalf Gregory wrote the
following letter to Amphilochius, who was at the time one of the
principal magistrates of the province.  The date of the letter is given
as <span class="sc"><span id="iv.iv.v.i-p3.1"></span>a.d.</span> 372,
the year of Gregory’s Ordination to the Priesthood.  For further
particulars about this Amphilochius, see introd. to letters II. and III.
to Cæsarius Epp. 22, 23.)

<span id="iv.iv.v.i-p4"></span>Support a wellbuilt chamber with columns
of gold, as Pindar <span id="fr_4747"></span>[4748](#fn_4747.md) says, and
make yourself from the beginning known to us on the right side in our
present anxiety, that you may build yourself a notable palace, and shew
yourself in it with a good fame.  But how will you do this?  By
honouring God and the things of God, than Whom there can be nothing
greater in your <span id="page_467">p. 467</span> <span
id="iv.iv.v.i-Page_467"></span>eyes.  But how, and by what act can you
honour Him?  By this one act, by protecting the servants of God and
ministers of the altar.  One of these is our fellow deacon Euthalius, on
whom, I know not how, the officers of the Prefecture are trying to
impose a payment of gold after his promotion to the higher rank.  Pray
do not allow this.  Reach a hand to this deacon and to the whole clergy,
and above all to me, for whom you care; for otherwise he would have to
endure a grievous wrong, alone of men deprived of the kindness of the
time and the privilege granted by the Emperor to the Clergy, and would
even be insulted and fined, possibly on account of my weakness.  It
would be well for you to prevent this even if others are not well
disposed.
