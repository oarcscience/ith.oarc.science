<span id="iii.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c21"><span
id="iii.xvi-p1.1"></span>Oration XXX.</span>

<span id="iii.xvi-p2"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="iii.xvi-p2.1"></span>The Fourth Theological Oration, Which is the
Second Concerning the Son.</span>

<span id="iii.xvi-p3"></span>I.  <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.xvi-p3.1"></span>Since</span> I have by the power of the Spirit
sufficiently overthrown the subtleties and intricacies of the arguments,
and already solved in the mass the objections and oppositions drawn from
Holy Scripture, with which these sacrilegious robbers of the Bible and
thieves of the sense of its contents draw over the multitude to their
side, and confuse the way of truth; and that not without clearness, as I
believe all candid persons will say; attributing to the Deity the higher
and diviner expressions, and the lower and more human to Him Who for us
men was the Second Adam, and was God made capable of suffering to strive
against sin; <span id="page_310">p. 310</span> <span
id="iii.xvi-Page_310"></span>yet we have not yet gone through the
passages in detail, because of the haste of our argument.  But since you
demand of us a brief explanation of each of them, that you may not be
carried away by the plausibilities of their arguments, we will therefore
state the explanations summarily, dividing them into numbers for the
sake of carrying them more easily in mind.

<span id="iii.xvi-p4"></span>II.  In their eyes the following is only
too ready to hand “The <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.xvi-p4.1"></span>Lord</span> created me at the beginning of His
ways with a view to His works.” <span
id="fr_3594"></span>[3595](#fn_3594.md)   How shall we meet this?  Shall we
bring an accusation against Solomon, or reject his former words because
of his fall in after-life?  Shall we say that the words are those of
Wisdom herself, as it were of Knowledge and the Creator-word, in
accordance with which all things were made?  For Scripture often
personifies many even lifeless objects; as for instance, “The Sea
said” <span id="fr_3595"></span>[3596](#fn_3595.md) so and so; and, “The
Depth saith, It is not in me;” <span
id="fr_3596"></span>[3597](#fn_3596.md) and “The Heavens declare the glory
of God;” <span id="fr_3597"></span>[3598](#fn_3597.md) and again a command
is given to the Sword; <span id="fr_3598"></span>[3599](#fn_3598.md) and
the Mountains and Hills are asked the reason of their skipping. <span
id="fr_3599"></span>[3600](#fn_3599.md)   We do not allege any of these,
though some of our predecessors used them as powerful arguments.  But
let us grant that the expression is used of our Saviour Himself, the
true Wisdom.  Let us consider one small point together.  What among all
things that exist is unoriginate?  The Godhead.  For no one can tell the
origin of God, that otherwise would be older than God.  But what is the
cause of the Manhood, which for our sake God assumed?  It was surely our
Salvation.  What else could it be?  Since then we find here clearly both
the Created and the Begetteth Me, the argument is simple.  Whatever we
find joined with a cause we are to refer to the Manhood, but all that is
absolute and unoriginate we are to reckon to the account of His
Godhead.  Well, then, is not this “Created” said in connection with a
cause?  He created Me, it so says, as the beginning of His ways, with a
view to his works.  Now, the Works of His Hands are verity and
judgment; <span id="fr_3600"></span>[3601](#fn_3600.md) for whose sake He
was anointed with Godhead; <span id="fr_3601"></span>[3602](#fn_3601.md)
for this anointing is of the Manhood; but the “He begetteth Me” is not
connected with a cause; or it is for you to shew the adjunct.  What
argument then will disprove that Wisdom is called a creature, in
connection with the lower generation, but Begotten in respect of the
first and more incomprehensible?

<span id="iii.xvi-p13"></span>III.  Next is the fact of His being called
Servant <span id="fr_3602"></span>[3603](#fn_3602.md) and serving many
well, and that it is a great thing for Him to be called the Child of
God.  For in truth He was in servitude to flesh and to birth and to the
conditions of our life with a view to our liberation, and to that of all
those whom He has saved, who were in bondage under sin.  What greater
destiny can befall man’s humility than that he should be intermingled
with God, and by this intermingling should be deified, <span
id="fr_3603"></span>[3604](#fn_3603.md) and that we should be so visited by
the Dayspring from on high, <span id="fr_3604"></span>[3605](#fn_3604.md)
that even that Holy Thing that should be born should be called the Son
of the Highest, <span id="fr_3605"></span>[3606](#fn_3605.md) and that
there should be bestowed upon Him a Name which is above every name?  And
what else can this be than God?—and that every knee should bow to Him
That was made of no reputation for us, and That mingled the Form of God
with the form of a servant, and that all the House of Israel should know
that God hath made Him both Lord and Christ? <span
id="fr_3606"></span>[3607](#fn_3606.md)   For all this was done by the
action of the Begotten, and by the good pleasure of Him That begat Him.

<span id="iii.xvi-p19"></span>IV.  Well, what is the second of their
great irresistible passages?  “He must reign,” <span
id="fr_3607"></span>[3608](#fn_3607.md) till such and such a time…and “be
received by heaven until the time of restitution,” <span
id="fr_3608"></span>[3609](#fn_3608.md) and “have the seat at the Right
Hand until the overthrow of His enemies.” <span
id="fr_3609"></span>[3610](#fn_3609.md)   But after this?  Must He cease to
be King, or be removed from Heaven?  Why, who shall make Him cease, or
for what cause?  What a bold and very anarchical interpreter you are;
and yet you have heard that Of His Kingdom *there shall be no
end*. <span id="fr_3610"></span>[3611](#fn_3610.md)   Your mistake arises
from not understanding that Until is not always exclusive of that which
comes after, but asserts *up to* that time, without denying what comes
<span id="page_311">p. 311</span> <span
id="iii.xvi-Page_311"></span>*after* it.  To take a single instance—how
else would you understand, “Lo, I am with you always, even unto the end
of the world?” <span id="fr_3611"></span>[3612](#fn_3611.md)   Does it mean
that He will no longer be so afterwards.  And for what reason?  But this
is not the only cause of your error; you also fail to distinguish
between the things that are signified.  He is said to reign in one sense
as the Almighty King, both of the willing and the unwilling; but in
another as producing in us submission, and placing us under His Kingship
as willingly acknowledging His Sovereignty.  Of His Kingdom, considered
in the former sense, there shall be no end.  But in the second sense,
what end will there be?  His taking us as His servants, on our entrance
into a state of salvation.  For what need is there to Work Submission in
us when we have already submitted?  After which He arises to judge the
earth, and to separate the saved from the lost.  After that He is to
stand as God in the midst of gods, <span
id="fr_3612"></span>[3613](#fn_3612.md) that is, of the saved,
distinguishing and deciding of what honour and of what mansion each is
worthy.

<span id="iii.xvi-p26"></span>V.  Take, in the next place, the
subjection by which you subject the Son to the Father.  What, you say,
is He not now subject, or must He, if He is God, be subject to
God? <span id="fr_3613"></span>[3614](#fn_3613.md)   You are fashioning
your argument as if it concerned some robber, or some hostile deity. 
But look at it in this manner:  that as for my sake He was called a
curse, <span id="fr_3614"></span>[3615](#fn_3614.md) Who destroyed my
curse; and sin, <span id="fr_3615"></span>[3616](#fn_3615.md) who taketh
away the sin of the world; and became a new Adam <span
id="fr_3616"></span>[3617](#fn_3616.md) to take the place of the old, just
so He makes my disobedience His own as Head of the whole body.  As long
then as I am disobedient and rebellious, both by denial of God and by my
passions, so long Christ also is called disobedient on my account.  But
when all things shall be subdued unto Him on the one hand by
acknowledgment of Him, and on the other by a reformation, then He
Himself also will have fulfilled His submission, bringing me whom He has
saved to God.  For this, according to my view, is the subjection of
Christ; namely, the fulfilling of the Father’s Will.  But as the Son
subjects all to the Father, so does the Father to the Son; the One by
His Work, the Other by His good pleasure, as we have already said.  And
thus He Who subjects presents to God that which he has subjected, making
our condition His own.  Of the same kind, it appears to me, is the
expression, “My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?” <span
id="fr_3617"></span>[3618](#fn_3617.md)   It was not He who was forsaken
either by the Father, or by His own Godhead, as some have thought, as if
It were afraid of the Passion, and therefore withdrew Itself from Him in
His Sufferings (for who compelled Him either to be born on earth at all,
or to be lifted up on the Cross?)  But as I said, He was in His own
Person representing us.  For we were the forsaken and despised before,
but now by the Sufferings of Him Who could not suffer, we were taken up
and saved.  Similarly, He makes His own our folly and our
transgressions; and says what follows in the Psalm, for it is very
evident that the Twenty-first <span id="fr_3618"></span>[3619](#fn_3618.md)
Psalm refers to Christ.

<span id="iii.xvi-p33"></span>VI.  The same consideration applies to
another passage, “He learnt obedience by the things which He
suffered,” <span id="fr_3619"></span>[3620](#fn_3619.md) and to His “strong
crying and tears,” and His “Entreaties,” and His “being heard,” and His”
Reverence,” all of which He wonderfully wrought out, like a drama whose
plot was devised on our behalf.  For in His character of the Word He was
neither obedient nor disobedient.  For such expressions belong to
servants, and inferiors, and the one applies to the better sort of them,
while the other belongs to those who deserve punishment.  But, in the
character of the Form of a Servant, He condescends to His fellow
servants, nay, to His servants, and takes upon Him a strange form,
bearing all me and mine in Himself, that in Himself He may exhaust the
bad, as fire does wax, or as the sun does the mists of earth; and that I
may partake of His nature by the blending.  Thus He honours obedience by
His action, and proves it experimentally by His Passion.  For to possess
the disposition is not enough, just as it would not be enough for us,
unless we also proved it by our acts; for action is the proof of
disposition.

<span id="iii.xvi-p35"></span>And perhaps it would not be wrong to
assume this also, that by the art <span
id="fr_3620"></span>[3621](#fn_3620.md) of His love for man He gauges our
obedience, and measures all by comparison with His own Sufferings, so
that He may know our condition by His own, and how much is demanded of
us, and how much we yield, taking into the account, along with our
environment, our weakness also.  For if the Light shining through the
veil <span id="fr_3621"></span>[3622](#fn_3621.md) upon the darkness, that
is upon this life, was persecuted by the other darkness (I mean, the
Evil <span id="page_312">p. 312</span> <span
id="iii.xvi-Page_312"></span>One and the Tempter), how much more will
the darkness be persecuted, as being weaker than it?  And what marvel is
it, that though He entirely escaped, we have been, at any rate in part,
overtaken?  For it is a more wonderful thing that He should have been
chased than that we should have been captured;—at least to the minds of
all who reason aright on the subject.  I will add yet another passage to
those I have mentioned, because I think that it clearly tends to the
same sense.  I mean “In that He hath suffered being tempted, He is able
to succour them that are tempted.” <span
id="fr_3622"></span>[3623](#fn_3622.md)   But God will be all in all in the
time of restitution; not in the sense that the Father alone will Be; and
the Son be wholly resolved into Him, like a torch into a great pyre,
from which it was reft away for a little space, and then put back (for I
would not have even the Sabellians injured <span
id="fr_3623"></span>[3624](#fn_3623) by such an expression.md); but the
entire Godhead…when we shall be no longer divided (as we now are by
movements and passions), and containing nothing at all of God, or very
little, but shall be entirely like.

<span id="iii.xvi-p40"></span>VII.  As your third point you count the
Word Greater; <span id="fr_3624"></span>[3625](#fn_3624.md) and as your
fourth, To My God and your God. <span
id="fr_3625"></span>[3626](#fn_3625.md)   And indeed, if He had been called
greater, and the word equal had not occurred, this might perhaps have
been a point in their favour.  But if we find both words clearly used
what will these gentlemen have to say?  How will it strengthen their
argument?  How will they reconcile the irreconcilable?  For that the
same thing should be at once greater than and equal to the same thing is
an impossibility; and the evident solution is that the Greater refers to
origination, while the Equal belongs to the Nature; and this we
acknowledge with much good will.  But perhaps some one else will back up
our attack on your argument, and assert, that That which is from such a
Cause is not inferior to that which has no Cause; for it would share the
glory of the Unoriginate, because it is from the Unoriginate.  And there
is, besides, the Generation, which is to all men a matter so marvellous
and of such Majesty.  For to say that he is greater than the Son
considered as man, is true indeed, but is no great thing.  For what
marvel is it if God is greater than man?  Surely that is enough to say
in answer to their talk about Greater.

<span id="iii.xvi-p43"></span>VIII.  As to the other passages, My God
would be used in respect, not of the Word, but of the Visible Word.  For
how could there be a God of Him Who is properly God?  In the same way He
is Father, not of the Visible, but of the Word; for our Lord was of two
Natures; so that one expression is used properly, the other improperly
in each of the two cases; but exactly the opposite way to their use in
respect of us.  For with respect to us God is properly our God, but not
properly our Father.  And this is the cause of the error of the
Heretics, namely the joining of these two Names, which are interchanged
because of the Union of the Natures.  And an indication of this is found
in the fact that wherever the Natures are distinguished in our thoughts
from one another, the Names are also distinguished; as you hear in
Paul’s words, “The God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of
Glory.” <span id="fr_3626"></span>[3627](#fn_3626.md)   The God of Christ,
but the Father of glory.  For although these two terms express but one
Person, yet this is not by a Unity of Nature, but by a Union of the
two.  What could be clearer?

<span id="iii.xvi-p45"></span>IX.  Fifthly, let it be alleged that it is
said of Him that He receives life, <span
id="fr_3627"></span>[3628](#fn_3627.md) judgment, <span
id="fr_3628"></span>[3629](#fn_3628.md) inheritance of the Gentiles, <span
id="fr_3629"></span>[3630](#fn_3629.md) or power over all flesh, <span
id="fr_3630"></span>[3631](#fn_3630.md) or glory, <span
id="fr_3631"></span>[3632](#fn_3631.md) or disciples, or whatever else is
mentioned.  This also belongs to the Manhood; and yet if you were to
ascribe it to the Godhead, it would be no absurdity.  For you would not
so ascribe it as if it were newly acquired, but as belonging to Him from
the beginning by reason of nature, and not as an act of favour.

<span id="iii.xvi-p51"></span>X.  Sixthly, let it be asserted that it is
written, The Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He seeth the Father
do. <span id="fr_3632"></span>[3633](#fn_3632.md)   The solution of this is
as follows:—Can and Cannot are not words with only one meaning, but have
many meanings.  On the one hand they are used sometimes in respect of
deficiency of strength, sometimes in respect of time, and sometimes
relatively to a certain object; as for instance, A Child cannot be an
Athlete, or, A Puppy cannot see, or fight with so and so.  Perhaps some
day the child will be an athlete, the puppy will see, will fight with
that other, though it may still be unable to fight with Any other.  Or
again, they may be used of that which is Generally true.  For
instance,—A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid; <span
id="fr_3633"></span>[3634](#fn_3633.md) while yet it might possibly be
hidden by another higher hill being in a line with it.  Or in another
sense they are used of a thing which is not reasonable; as, Can the
Children of the Bridechamber fast while the <span id="page_313">p.
313</span> <span id="iii.xvi-Page_313"></span>Bridegroom is with
them; <span id="fr_3634"></span>[3635](#fn_3634.md) whether He be
considered as visible in bodily form (for the time of His sojourning
among us was not one of mourning, but of gladness), or, as the Word. 
For why should they keep a bodily fast who are cleansed by the
Word? <span id="fr_3635"></span>[3636](#fn_3635.md)   Or, again, they are
used of that which is contrary to the will; as in, He could do no mighty
works there because of their unbelief, <span
id="fr_3636"></span>[3637](#fn_3636.md) —i.e. of those who should receive
them.  For since in order to healing there is need of both faith in the
patient and power in the Healer, <span
id="fr_3637"></span>[3638](#fn_3637.md) when one of the two failed the
other was impossible.  But probably this sense also is to be referred to
the head of the unreasonable.  For healing is not reasonable in the case
of those who would afterwards be injured by unbelief.  The sentence The
world cannot hate you, <span id="fr_3638"></span>[3639](#fn_3638.md) comes
under the same head, as does also How can ye, being evil, speak good
things? <span id="fr_3639"></span>[3640](#fn_3639.md)   For in what sense
is either impossible, except that it is contrary to the will?  There is
a somewhat similar meaning in the expressions which imply that a thing
impossible by nature is possible to God if He so wills; <span
id="fr_3640"></span>[3641](#fn_3640.md) as that a man cannot be born a
second time, <span id="fr_3641"></span>[3642](#fn_3641.md) or that a needle
will not let a camel through it. <span
id="fr_3642"></span>[3643](#fn_3642.md)   For what could prevent either of
these things happening, if God so willed?

<span id="iii.xvi-p63"></span>XI.  And besides all this, there is the
absolutely impossible and inadmissible, as that which we are now
examining.  For as we assert that it is impossible for God to be evil,
or not to exist—for this would be indicative of weakness in God rather
than of strength—or for the non-existent to exist, or for two and two to
make both four and ten, <span id="fr_3643"></span>[3644](#fn_3643.md) so it
is impossible and inconceivable that the Son should do anything that the
Father doeth not. <span id="fr_3644"></span>[3645](#fn_3644.md)   For all
things that the Father hath are the Son’s; <span
id="fr_3645"></span>[3646](#fn_3645.md) and on the other hand, all that
belongs to the Son is the Father’s.  Nothing then is peculiar, because
all things are in common.  For Their Being itself is common and equal,
even though the Son receive it from the Father.  It is in respect of
this that it is said I live by the Father; <span
id="fr_3646"></span>[3647](#fn_3646.md) not as though His Life and Being
were kept together by the Father, but because He has His Being from Him
beyond all time, and beyond all cause.  But how does He see the Father
doing, and do likewise?  Is it like those who copy pictures and letters,
because they cannot attain the truth unless by looking at the original,
and being led by the hand by it?  But how shall Wisdom stand in need of
a teacher, or be incapable of acting unless taught?  And in what sense
does the Father “Do” in the present or in the past?  Did He make another
world before this one, or is He going to make a world to come?  And did
the Son look at that and make this?  Or will He look at the other, and
make one like it?  According to this argument there must be Four worlds,
two made by the Father, and two by the Son.  What an absurdity!  He
cleanses lepers, and delivers men from evil spirits, and diseases, and
quickens the dead, and walks upon the sea, and does all His other works;
but in what case, or when did the Father do these acts before Him?  Is
it not clear that the Father impressed the ideas of these same actions,
and the Word brings them to pass, yet not in slavish or unskilful
fashion, but with full knowledge and in a masterly way, or, to speak
more properly, like the Father?  For in this sense I understand the
words that whatsoever is done by the Father, these things doeth the Son
likewise; not, that is, because of the likeness of the things done, but
in respect of the Authority.  This might well also be the meaning of the
passage which says that the Father worketh hitherto and the Son
also; <span id="fr_3647"></span>[3648](#fn_3647.md) and not only so but it
refers also to the government and preservation of the things which He
has made; as is shewn by the passage which says that He maketh His
Angels Spirits, <span id="fr_3648"></span>[3649](#fn_3648.md) and that the
earth is founded upon its steadfastness (though once for all these
things were fixed and made) and that the thunder is made firm and the
wind created. <span id="fr_3649"></span>[3650](#fn_3649.md)   Of all these
things the Word was given once, but the Action is continuous even now.

<span id="iii.xvi-p71"></span>XII.  Let them quote in the seventh place
that The Son came down from Heaven, not to do His own Will, but the Will
of Him That sent Him. <span id="fr_3650"></span>[3651](#fn_3650.md)   Well,
if this had not been said by Himself Who came down, we should say that
the phrase was modelled as issuing from the Human Nature, not from Him
who is conceived of in His character as the Saviour, for His Human Will
cannot be opposed to God, seeing it is altogether taken into God; but
conceived of simply as in our nature, inasmuch as the human will does
not completely follow the Divine, but for the most part struggles
against and resists it.  For we understand in the same way the words,
Father, if <span id="page_314">p. 314</span> <span
id="iii.xvi-Page_314"></span>it be possible, let this cup pass from Me;
Nevertheless let not what I will but Thy Will prevail. <span
id="fr_3651"></span>[3652](#fn_3651.md)   For it is not likely that He did
not know whether it was possible or not, or that He would oppose will to
will.  But since, as this is the language of Him Who assumed our Nature
(for He it was Who came down), and not of the Nature which He assumed,
we must meet the objection in this way, that the passage does not mean
that the Son has a special will of His own, besides that of the Father,
but that He has not; so that the meaning would be, “not to do Mine own
Will, for there is none of Mine apart from, but that which is common to,
Me and Thee; for as We have one Godhead, so We have one Will.” <span
id="fr_3652"></span>[3653](#fn_3652.md)   For many such expressions are
used in relation to this Community, and are expressed not positively but
negatively; as, e.g., God giveth not the Spirit by measure, <span
id="fr_3653"></span>[3654](#fn_3653.md) for as a matter of fact He does not
give the Spirit to the Son, nor does He *measure* It, for God is not
measured by God; or again, Not my transgression nor my sin. <span
id="fr_3654"></span>[3655](#fn_3654.md)   The words are not used because He
has these things, but because He has them not.  And again, Not for our
righteousness which we have done, <span
id="fr_3655"></span>[3656](#fn_3655.md) for we have not done any.  And this
meaning is evident also in the clauses which follow.  For what, says He,
is the Will of My Father?  That everyone that believeth on the Son
should be saved, <span id="fr_3656"></span>[3657](#fn_3656.md) and obtain
the final Resurrection. <span id="fr_3657"></span>[3658](#fn_3657.md)   Now
is this the Will of the Father, but not of the Son?  Or does He preach
the Gospel, and receive men’s faith against His will?  Who could believe
that?  Moreover, that passage, too, which says that the Word which is
heard is not the Son’s <span id="fr_3658"></span>[3659](#fn_3658.md) but
the Father’s has the same force.  For I cannot see how that which is
common to two can be said to belong to one alone, however much I
consider it, and I do not think any one else can.  If then you hold this
opinion concerning the Will, you will be right and reverent in your
opinion, as I think, and as every right-minded person thinks.

<span id="iii.xvi-p81"></span>XIII.  The eighth passage is, That they
may know Thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ Whom Thou hast
sent; <span id="fr_3659"></span>[3660](#fn_3659.md) and There is none good
save one, that is, God. <span id="fr_3660"></span>[3661](#fn_3660.md)   The
solution of this appears to me very easy.  For if you attribute this
only to the Father, where will you place the Very Truth?  For if you
conceive in this manner of the meaning of To the only wise God, <span
id="fr_3661"></span>[3662](#fn_3661.md) or Who only hath Immortality,
Dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto, <span
id="fr_3662"></span>[3663](#fn_3662.md) or of to the king of the Ages,
immortal, invisible, and only wise God, <span
id="fr_3663"></span>[3664](#fn_3663.md) then the Son has vanished under
sentence of death, or of darkness, or at any rate condemned to be
neither wise nor king, nor invisible, nor God at all, which sums up all
these points.  And how will you prevent His Goodness, which especially
belongs to God alone, from perishing with the rest?  I, however, think
that the passage That they may know Thee the only true God, was said to
overthrow those gods which are falsely so called, for He would not have
added and Jesus Christ Whom Thou hast sent, if The Only True God were
contrasted with Him, and the sentence did not proceed upon the basis of
a common Godhead.  The “None is Good” meets the tempting Lawyer, who was
testifying to His Goodness viewed as Man.  For perfect goodness, He
says, is God’s alone, even if a man is called perfectly good.  As for
instance, A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth
forth good things. <span id="fr_3664"></span>[3665](#fn_3664.md)   And, I
will give the kingdom to one who is good above Thee. <span
id="fr_3665"></span>[3666](#fn_3665.md) …Words of God, speaking to Saul
about David.  Or again, Do good, O Lord, unto the good <span
id="fr_3666"></span>[3667](#fn_3666.md) …and all other like expressions
concerning those of us who are praised, upon whom it is a kind of
effluence from the Supreme Good, and has come to them in a secondary
degree.  It will be best of all if we can persuade you of this.  But if
not, what will you say to the suggestion on the other side, that on your
hypothesis the Son has been called the only God.  In what passage?  Why,
in this:—This is your God; no other shall be accounted of in comparison
with Him, and a little further on, after this did He shew Himself upon
earth, and conversed with men. <span
id="fr_3667"></span>[3668](#fn_3667.md)   This addition proves clearly that
the words are not used of the Father, but of the Son; for it was He Who
in bodily form companied with us, and was in this lower world.  Now, if
we should determine to take these words as said in contrast with the
Father, and not with the imaginary gods, we lose the Father by the very
terms which we were pressing against the Son.  And what could be more
disastrous than such a victory?

<span id="iii.xvi-p91"></span>XIV.  Ninthly, they allege, seeing He ever
<span id="page_315">p. 315</span> <span
id="iii.xvi-Page_315"></span>liveth to make intercession for us. <span
id="fr_3668"></span>[3669](#fn_3668.md)   O, how beautiful and mystical and
kind.  For to intercede does not imply to seek for vengeance, as is most
men’s way (for in that there would be something of humiliation), but it
is to plead for us by reason of His Mediatorship, just as the Spirit
also is said to make intercession for us. <span
id="fr_3669"></span>[3670](#fn_3669.md)   For there is One God, and One
Mediator between God and Man, the Man Christ Jesus. <span
id="fr_3670"></span>[3671](#fn_3670.md)   For He still pleads even now as
Man for my salvation; for He continues to wear the Body which He
assumed, until He make me God by the power of His Incarnation; although
He is no longer known after the flesh <span
id="fr_3671"></span>[3672](#fn_3671.md) —I mean, the passions of the flesh,
the same, except sin, as ours.  Thus too, we have an Advocate, <span
id="fr_3672"></span>[3673](#fn_3672.md) Jesus Christ, not indeed
prostrating Himself for us before the Father, and falling down before
Him in slavish fashion…Away with a suspicion so truly slavish and
unworthy of the Spirit!  For neither is it seemly for the Father to
require this, nor for the Son to submit to it; nor is it just to think
it of God.  But by what He suffered as Man, He as the Word and the
Counsellor persuades Him to be patient.  I think this is the meaning of
His Advocacy.

<span id="iii.xvi-p97"></span>XV.  Their tenth objection is the
ignorance, and the statement that Of the last day and hour knoweth no
man, not even the Son Himself, but the Father. <span
id="fr_3673"></span>[3674](#fn_3673.md)   And yet how can Wisdom be
ignorant of anything—that is, Wisdom Who made the worlds, Who perfects
them, Who remodels them, Who is the Limit of all things that were made,
Who knoweth the things of God as the spirit of a man knows the things
that are in him? <span id="fr_3674"></span>[3675](#fn_3674.md)   For what
can be more perfect than this knowledge?  How then can you say that all
things before that hour He knows accurately, and all things that are to
happen about the time of the end, but of the hour itself He is
ignorant?  For such a thing would be like a riddle; as if one were to
say that he knew accurately all that was in front of the wall, but did
not know the wall itself; or that, knowing the end of the day, he did
not know the beginning of the night—where knowledge of the one
necessarily brings in the other.  Thus everyone must see that He knows
as God, and knows not as Man;—if one may separate the visible from that
which is discerned by thought alone.  For the absolute and unconditioned
use of the Name “The Son” in this passage, without the addition of whose
Son, gives us this thought, that we are to understand the ignorance in
the most reverent sense, by attributing it to the Manhood, and not to
the Godhead.

<span id="iii.xvi-p100"></span>XVI.  If then this argument is
sufficient, let us stop here, and not enquire further.  But if not, our
second argument is as follows:—Just as we do in all other instances, so
let us refer His knowledge of the greatest events, in honour of the
Father, to The Cause.  And I think that anyone, even if he did not read
it in the way that one of our own Students <span
id="fr_3675"></span>[3676](#fn_3675.md) did, would soon perceive that not
even the Son knows the day or hour otherwise than as the Father does. 
For what do we conclude from this?  That since the Father knows,
therefore also does the Son, as it is evident that this cannot be known
or comprehended by any but the First Nature.  There remains for us to
interpret the passage about His receiving commandment, <span
id="fr_3676"></span>[3677](#fn_3676.md) and having kept His Commandments,
and done always those things that please Him; and further concerning His
being made perfect, <span id="fr_3677"></span>[3678](#fn_3677.md) and His
exaltation, <span id="fr_3678"></span>[3679](#fn_3678.md) and His learning
obedience by the things which He suffered; and also His High Priesthood,
and His Oblation, and His Betrayal, and His prayer to Him That was able
to save Him from death, and His Agony and Bloody Sweat and Prayer, <span
id="fr_3679"></span>[3680](#fn_3679.md) and such like things; if it were
not evident to every one that such words are concerned, not with That
Nature Which is unchangeable and above all capacity of suffering, but
with the passible Humanity.  This, then, is the argument concerning
these objections, so far as to be a sort of foundation and memorandum
for the use of those who are better able to conduct the enquiry to a
more complete working out.  It may, however, be worth while, and will be
consistent with what has been already said, instead of passing over
without remark the actual Titles of the Son (there are many of them, and
they are concerned with many of His Attributes), to set before you the
meaning of each of them, and to point out the mystical meaning of the
names.

<span id="iii.xvi-p106"></span>XVII.  We will begin thus.  The Deity
cannot be expressed in words.  And this is proved to us, not only by
argument, but by the wisest and most ancient of the Hebrews, so far as
they have given us reason for conjecture.  For they appropriated certain
characters to the honour of the Deity, and would not even allow the name
of anything inferior to God to be written with the same letters as that
of <span id="page_316">p. 316</span> <span
id="iii.xvi-Page_316"></span>God, because to their minds it was improper
that the Deity should even to that extent admit any of His creatures to
a share with Himself.  How then could they have admitted that the
invisible and separate Nature can be explained by divisible words?  For
neither has any one yet breathed the whole air, nor has any mind
entirely comprehended, or speech exhaustively contained the Being of
God.  But we sketch Him by His Attributes, and so obtain a certain faint
and feeble and partial idea concerning Him, and our best Theologian is
he who has, not indeed discovered the whole, for our present chain does
not allow of our seeing the whole, but conceived of Him to a greater
extent than another, and gathered in himself more of the Likeness or
adumbration of the Truth, or whatever we may call it.

<span id="iii.xvi-p107"></span>XVIII.  As far then as we can reach, He
Who Is, and God, are the special names of His Essence; and of these
especially He Who Is, not only because when He spake to Moses in the
mount, and Moses asked what His Name was, this was what He called
Himself, bidding him say to the people “I Am hath sent me,” <span
id="fr_3680"></span>[3681](#fn_3680.md) but also because we find that this
Name is the more strictly appropriate.  For the Name <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.xvi-p108.2"></span>Θεός</span> (God), even
if, as those who are skilful in these matters say, it were derived from
<span class="Greek"><span id="iii.xvi-p108.3"></span>Θέειν</span> <span
id="fr_3681"></span>[3682](#fn_3681) (to run.md) or from <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.xvi-p109.9"></span>Αἴθειν</span> (to blaze),
from continual motion, and because He consumes evil conditions of things
(from which fact He is also called A Consuming Fire), <span
id="fr_3682"></span>[3683](#fn_3682.md) would still be one of the Relative
Names, and not an Absolute one; as again is the case with Lord, <span
id="fr_3683"></span>[3684](#fn_3683.md) which also is called a name of
God.  I am the Lord Thy God, He says, that is My name; <span
id="fr_3684"></span>[3685](#fn_3684.md) and, The Lord is His name. <span
id="fr_3685"></span>[3686](#fn_3685.md)   But we are enquiring into a
Nature Whose Being is absolute and not into Being bound up with
something else.  But Being is in its proper sense peculiar to God, and
belongs to Him entirely, and is not limited or cut short by any Before
or After, for indeed in him there is no past or future.

<span id="iii.xvi-p114"></span>XIX.  Of the other titles, some are
evidently names of His Authority, others of His Government of the world,
and of this viewed under a twofold aspect, the one before the other in
the Incarnation.  For instance the Almighty, the King of Glory, or of
The Ages, or of The Powers, or of The Beloved, or of Kings.  Or again
the Lord of Sabaoth, that is of Hosts, or of Powers, or of Lords; these
are clearly titles belonging to His Authority.  But the God either of
Salvation or of Vengeance, or of Peace, or of Righteousness; or of
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and of all the spiritual Israel that seeth
God,—these belong to His Government.  For since we are governed by these
three things, the fear of punishment, the hope of salvation and of glory
besides, and the practice of the virtues by which these are attained,
the Name of the God of Vengeance governs fear, and that of the God of
Salvation our hope, and that of the God of Virtues our practice; that
whoever attains to any of these may, as carrying God in himself, press
on yet more unto perfection, and to that affinity which arises out of
virtues.  Now these are Names common to the Godhead, but the Proper Name
of the Unoriginate is Father, and that of the unoriginately Begotten is
Son, and that of the unbegottenly Proceeding or going forth is The Holy
Ghost.  Let us proceed then to the Names of the Son, which were our
starting point in this part of our argument.

<span id="iii.xvi-p115"></span>XX.  In my opinion He is called Son
because He is identical with the Father in Essence; and not only for
this reason, but also because He is Of Him.  And He is called
Only-Begotten, not because He is the only Son and of the Father alone,
and only a Son; but also because the manner of His Sonship is peculiar
to Himself and not shared by bodies.  And He is called the Word, because
He is related to the Father as Word to Mind; not only on account of His
passionless Generation, but also because of the Union, and of His
declaratory function.  Perhaps too this relation might be compared to
that between the Definition and the Thing defined <span
id="fr_3686"></span>[3687](#fn_3686.md) since this also is called <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.xvi-p116.3"></span>Λόγος</span>. <span
id="fr_3687"></span>[3688](#fn_3687.md)   For, it says, he that hath mental
perception of the Son (for this is the meaning of Hath Seen) hath also
perceived the Father; <span id="fr_3688"></span>[3689](#fn_3688.md) and the
Son is a concise demonstration and easy setting forth of the Father’s
Nature.  For every thing that is begotten is a silent word of him that
begat it.  And if any one should say that this Name was given Him
because <span id="page_317">p. 317</span> <span
id="iii.xvi-Page_317"></span>He exists in all things that are, he would
not be wrong.  For what is there that consists but by the word?  He is
also called Wisdom, as the Knowledge of things divine and human.  For
how is it possible that He Who made all things should be ignorant of the
reasons of what He has made?  And Power, as the Sustainer of all created
things, and the Furnisher to them of power to keep themselves together. 
And Truth, as being in nature One and not many (for truth is one and
falsehood is manifold), and as the pure Seal of the Father and His most
unerring Impress.  And the Image as of one substance with Him, and
because He is of the Father, and not the Father of Him.  For this is of
the Nature of an Image, to be the reproduction of its Archetype, and of
that whose name it bears; only that there is more here.  For in ordinary
language an image is a motionless representation of that which has
motion; but in this case it is the living reproduction of the Living
One, and is more exactly like than was Seth to Adam, <span
id="fr_3689"></span>[3690](#fn_3689.md) or any son to his father.  For such
is the nature of simple Existences, that it is not correct to say of
them that they are Like in one particular and Unlike in another; but
they are a complete resemblance, and should rather be called Identical
than Like.  Moreover he is called Light as being the Brightness of souls
cleansed by word and life.  For if ignorance and sin be darkness,
knowledge and a godly life will be Light.…And He is called Life, because
He is Light, and is the constituting and creating Power of every
reasonable soul.  For in Him we live and move and have our being, <span
id="fr_3690"></span>[3691](#fn_3690.md) according to the double power of
that Breathing into us; for we were all inspired by Him with
breath, <span id="fr_3691"></span>[3692](#fn_3691.md) and as many of us as
were capable of it, and in so far as we open the mouth of our mind, with
God the Holy Ghost.  He is Righteousness, because He distributes
according to that which we deserve, and is a righteous Arbiter both for
those who are under the Law and for those who are under Grace, for soul
and body, so that the former should rule, and the latter obey, and the
higher have supremacy over the lower; that the worse may not rise in
rebellion against the better.  He is Sanctification, as being Purity,
that the Pure may be contained by Purity.  And Redemption, because He
sets us free, who were held captive under sin, giving Himself a Ransom
for us, the Sacrifice to make expiation for the world.  And
Resurrection, because He raises up from hence, and brings to life again
us, who were slain by sin.

<span id="iii.xvi-p122"></span>XXI.  These names however are still
common to Him Who is above us, and to Him Who came for our sake.  But
others are peculiarly our own, and belong to that nature which He
assumed.  So He is called Man, not only that through His Body He may be
apprehended by embodied creatures, whereas otherwise this would be
impossible because of His incomprehensible nature; but also that by
Himself He may sanctify humanity, and be as it were a leaven to the
whole lump; and by uniting to Himself that which was condemned may
release it from all condemnation, becoming for all men all things that
we are, except sin;—body, soul, mind and all through which death
reaches—and thus He became Man, who is the combination of all these; God
in visible form, because He retained that which is perceived by mind
alone.  He is Son of Man, both on account of Adam, and of the Virgin
from Whom He came; from the one as a forefather, from the other as His
Mother, both in accordance with the law of generation, and apart from
it.  He is Christ, because of His Godhead.  For this is the Anointing of
His Manhood, and does not, as is the case with all other Anointed Ones,
sanctify by its action, but by the Presence in His Fulness of the
Anointing One; the effect of which is that That which anoints is called
Man, and makes that which is anointed God.  He is The Way, because He
leads us through Himself; The Door, as letting us in; the Shepherd, as
making us dwell in a place of green pastures, <span
id="fr_3692"></span>[3693](#fn_3692.md) and bringing us up by waters of
rest, and leading us there, and protecting us from wild beasts,
converting the erring, bringing back that which was lost, binding up
that which was broken, guarding the strong, and bringing them together
in the Fold beyond, with words of pastoral knowledge.  The Sheep, as the
Victim:  The Lamb, as being perfect:  the Highpriest, as the Offerer;
Melchisedec, as without Mother in that Nature which is above us, and
without Father in ours; and without genealogy above (for who, it says,
shall declare His generation?) and moreover, as King of Salem, which
means Peace, and King of Righteousness, and as receiving tithes from
Patriarchs, when they prevail over powers of evil.  They are the titles
of the Son.  Walk through them, those that are lofty in a godlike
manner; those that belong to the body in a manner suitable to them; or
rather, altogether in a godlike manner, that thou mayest become a god,
ascending from <span id="page_318">p. 318</span> <span
id="iii.xvi-Page_318"></span>below, for His sake Who came down from on
high for ours.  In all and above all keep to this, and thou shalt never
err, either in the loftier or the lowlier names; Jesus Christ is the
Same yesterday and to-day in the Incarnation, and in the Spirit for ever
and ever.  Amen.

The <span class="sc"><span id="iii.xvi-p5.2"></span>A.V.</span> has in
the place Possessed, and this has very high authority:  but the Hebrew
word in almost every case signifies to Acquire.  It is used, says Bp.
Wordsworth (ad h. l.), about eighty times in the O.T., and in only five
places is it rendered in our Translation by Possess;—in two of which
([Gen. 14:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#010.md),
[22](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#022.md), [Ps.

it might well have the sense of Creating, and in two ([Jer.

of Getting.  In some ancient Versions (<span class="sc"><span
id="iii.xvi-p5.5"></span>LXX.</span> and Syr.) it is rendered by
Create.  S. Jerome in his Ep. ad Cypr. (ii. 697) says that the word may
here be understood of possession, but in his Comm. on [Ephes.
ii.](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#000.md)<span id="iii.xvi-p5.6"></span> (p.
342) he adopts the rendering Create, which he applies to the
Incarnation, as in several places does S. Athanasius.  But Wordsworth
thinks it better to apply the words to the Eternal Generation, as S.
Hilary expounds it (c. Arianos, who argued from it that Christ was a
creature); “quia Filius Dei non corporalis parturitionis est genitus
exemplo, sed ex perfecto Deo perfectus Deus natus; et ideo ait creatam
se esse Sapientia; omnem in generatione sua notionem passionis
corporalis excludens.”

this paraphrase to the Divine Nature of our Lord, and is not in any way
denying to Him a Human Will also;—indeed in the preceding sentence he
distinctly asserts it.  The whole passage makes very strongly against
the heresy of Apollinarius, which adopted the Arian tenet that in our
Lord the Divine Logos supplied the place of the human soul.

<span id="iii.xvi-p109"></span> The derivation of <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.xvi-p109.1"></span>Θεός</span> from <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.xvi-p109.2"></span>Θέειν</span> (to run) is
given by Plato (Crat., 397c).  That from <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xvi-p109.3"></span>Αἴθειν</span> (to blaze) is found also in S.
John Damascene (De Fide Orth., I., 12), who however may have borrowed it
from S. Gregory, or from the source whence the latter took it.  S.
Athanasius also admits it (De Defin., 11).  Other definitions are,
according to Suicer, (1) <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xvi-p109.4"></span>Θεᾶσθαι</span> (to see), e.g. Greg. Nyss. in
Cant. Hom., V.  (2) <span class="Greek"><span

Misc., Qu. XI. <span class="Greek"><span id="iii.xvi-p109.6"></span>Θεὸς
λέγεται ἀπὸ τὸ θεωρεῖν τὰ πάντα, οἱονεὶ θεωρὸς καὶ θεος, ἤγουν θεάτης
