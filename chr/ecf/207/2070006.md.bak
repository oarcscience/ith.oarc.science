<span id="ii.iii.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="ii.iii.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter II.—Catechetical Instruction.</span>

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p2"></span>§ 1.  *Catechesis*.  The term
“Catechesis” in its widest sense includes instruction by word of mouth
on any subject sacred or profane <span id="fr_72"></span>[73](#fn_72.md) ,
but is especially applied to Christian teaching, <span id="page_xx">p.
xx</span> <span id="ii.iii.ii-Page_xx"></span>whether of an elementary
kind appropriate to new converts, or, as in the famous Catechetical
School of Alexandria, extending to the higher interpretation of Holy
Scripture, and the exposition of Christian philosophy.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p4"></span>The earliest known example of a
Catechetical work is the “*Teaching of the Twelve Apostles*,” which
Athanasius names among the “books not included in the Canon, but
appointed by the Fathers to be read by those who are just recently
coming to us, and wish to be instructed in the word of godliness (<span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.ii-p4.1"></span>κατηχεῖσθαι τὸν τῆς
εὐσεβείας λόγον</span>) <span id="fr_73"></span>[74](#fn_73.md) .”  The use
of the Didache for the instruction of recent converts from Paganism
agrees with its original purpose as stated in the longer title,
“*Teaching of the Lord through the Twelve Apostles for the Gentiles*.” 
The first six chapters are evidently adapted for those who need
elementary instruction, more particularly for Catechumens of Gentile
descent, as distinct from Jewish candidates for Baptism <span
id="fr_74"></span>[75](#fn_74.md) .  The remaining chapters of the Didache
relate chiefly to the administration of Baptism, to Prayer, Fasting, and
the services of the Lord’s Day, and to the celebration of the Agape and
Eucharist <span id="fr_75"></span>[76](#fn_75.md) .  This same division of
subjects is observed in the two classes of S. Cyril’s Catechetical
Lectures:  the first class, including the Procatechesis, consists of XIX
Lectures addressed to candidates for Baptism, and these are followed by
five “Mystagogic” Lectures, so called as being explanations of the
Sacramental Mysteries to the newly-baptized.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p8"></span>The Didaché was taken as the basis of
other manuals of instruction, as is evident from the fact that the
greater part of the first six chapters is imbedded in “ The Apostolical
Church Order,” supposed to date from Egypt in the third century.  The
Greek text, with an English translation, of the part corresponding with
the Didaché, is given in “ The oldest Church Manual “ as Document V.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p9"></span>A further development of the Didaché,
“adapted to the state of the Eastern Church in the first half of the
fourth century,” is contained in the Seventh Book of the Apostolical
Constitutions of Pseudo-Clement of Rome, chs. i.–xxxii.  “Here the
Didaché is embodied almost word for word, but with significant
omissions, alterations, and additions, which betray a later age.…The
Didaché was thus superseded by a more complete and timely Church Manual,
and disappeared.”  Dr. Schaff has appended this document also to his
edition of the Didaché, noting the borrowed passages on the margin, and
distinguishing them by spaced type in the Greek text, and by italics in
the English translation.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p10"></span>In this work the directions concerning
the instruction of Catechumens and their Baptism are addressed to the
Catechist and the Minister of Baptism.  They contain only a short
outline (c. xxxix.) of the subjects in which the Catechumens are to be
instructed, most if not all of which are explained at large in Cyril’s
Lectures:  and in the directions concerning Baptism, Chrism, and the
Eucharist, the similarity is so close, that in many passages of the
Constitutions the author seems to be referring especially to the use of
the Church of Jerusalem.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p11"></span>From this close affinity with earlier
works we may be assured that in the Catecheses of Cyril we have
trustworthy evidence of the great care which the Church had from the
beginning bestowed on the instruction and training of converts, before
admitting them to the privilege of Baptism; but beyond this, Cyril’s own
work has a peculiar value as the earliest extant example of a full,
systematic, and continuous course of such instruction.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p12"></span>§ 2.  *Catechist*.  The duty of
catechizing was not limited to a class of persons permanently set apart
for that purpose, but all orders of the Clergy were accustomed to take
part in the work.  Even laymen were encouraged to teach children or new
converts the first elements of religion, as we learn from Cyril’s
exhortation:  “If thou hast a child according to the flesh, admonish him
of this now; and if thou hast begotten one through *catechizing*, put
him also on <span id="page_xxi">p. xxi</span> <span
id="ii.iii.ii-Page_xxi"></span>his guard <span
id="fr_76"></span>[77](#fn_76.md) .”  That this remark was addressed not to
the Catechumens, but to such of the Faithful as happened to be present
among his audience, appears from what he says elsewhere, “So thou
likewise, though not daring before thy Baptism to wrestle with the
adversaries, yet after thou hast received the grace, and art henceforth
confident in *the armour of righteousness*, must then do battle, and
preach the Gospel, if thou wilt <span id="fr_77"></span>[78](#fn_77.md) .”

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p15"></span>The more systematic instruction of those
who had been already admitted to the order of Catechumens was entrusted
to persons appointed to this special duty.  Thus Origen “was in his
eighteenth year when he took charge of the Catechetical School at
Alexandria,” which “was entrusted to him alone by Demetrius, who
presided over the Church <span id="fr_78"></span>[79](#fn_78.md) :”  and S.
Augustine’s Treatise, *De Catechizandis Rudibus*, was addressed to
Deogratias, who being a Deacon at Carthage, and highly esteemed for his
skill and success as a Catechist, felt so strongly the importance of the
work and his own insufficiency, that he wrote to Augustine for advice as
to the best method of instructing those who were brought to him to be
taught the first elements of the Christian Faith.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p17"></span>The final training of the <span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.ii-p17.1"></span>φωτιζόμενοι</span>, or
candidates for Baptism, was undertaken in part by the Bishop himself,
but chiefly by a Priest specially appointed by him.  Of the part taken
by the Bishop mention is made by S. Ambrose in a letter to his sister
Marcellina (*Ep*. xx.):  “On the following day, which was the Lord’s
day, after the Lessons and Sermon, the Catechumens had been dismissed,
and I was delivering the Creed to some candidates (*Competentes*) in the
Baptistery of the Basilica.”

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p18"></span>Of this “delivery of the Creed,” which
was usually done by a Presbyter, we have examples in S. Augustine’s
Sermons *In traditione Symboli*, ccxii.–ccxiv., each of which contains a
brief recapitulation and explanation of the several articles of belief. 
In Serm. ccxiv., after a short introduction, we find the following note
inserted by the preacher himself.  \[“*After this preface the whole
Creed is to be recited, without interposing any discussion*.  ‘<span
class="sc"><span id="ii.iii.ii-p18.1"></span>I believe in God the Father
Almighty</span>,’ and the rest that follows.  Which Creed, thou knowest,
is not wont to be written:  after it has been said, the following
discussion (*disputatio*) is to be added.”\]

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p19"></span>From the opening words of Sermon ccxiv.,
and of ccxvi., “*ad Competentes*,” it is evident that these were
delivered by S. Augustine as the first-fruits of his ministry very soon
after he had been reluctantly ordained Priest (<span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iii.ii-p19.1"></span>a.d.</span> 391).  Two other examples of
addresses to Candidates for Baptism are the *Catecheses* I., II., <span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.ii-p19.2"></span>πρὸς τοὺς μέλλοντας
φωτίζεσθαι</span>, delivered at Antioch by S. Chrysostom while a
Presbyter.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p20"></span>Another duty often undertaken by the
Bishop was to hear each Candidate separately recite the Creed, and then
to expound to them all the Lord’s Prayer <span
id="fr_79"></span>[80](#fn_79.md) .

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p22"></span>§ 3.  *Catechumens*.  The term
Catechumen denoted a person who was receiving instruction in the
Christian religion with a view to being in due time baptized.  Such
persons were either converts from Paganism and Judaism, or children of
Christian parents whose Baptism had been deferred.  For though the
practice of Infant-Baptism was certainly common in the Early
Church <span id="fr_80"></span>[81](#fn_80.md) , it was not compulsory nor
invariable.  “In many cases Christian parents may have shared and acted
on the opinion expressed by Tertullian in the second century, and by
Gregory Nazianzen in the fourth, and thought it well to defer the
Baptism of children, cases of grave sickness excepted, till they were
able to make answer in their own name to the interrogations of the
baptismal rite <span id="fr_81"></span>[82](#fn_81.md) .”

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p25"></span><span id="page_xxii">p. xxii</span>
<span id="ii.iii.ii-Page_xxii"></span>It is stated by Bingham <span
id="fr_82"></span>[83](#fn_82.md) , but without any reference to ancient
authors, that “the child of believing parents, as they were baptized in
infancy, were admitted Catechumens as soon as they were capable of
learning.”  Though the title “Catechumen” was not usually applied to
those who had been already baptized, it is probable that such children
were admitted to the Lectures addressed to Catechumens both in the
earlier and later stage of their preparation:  for it seems to be
implied in the passage quoted above from *Cat*. xv. 18, that admission
was not limited to the candidates for Baptism.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p27"></span>To believe and to be baptized are the
two essential conditions of membership in Christ’s Church <span
id="fr_83"></span>[84](#fn_83.md) :  but for the admission of new converts
to the class of Catechumens nothing more could be required than evidence
of a sincere desire to understand, to believe, and ultimately to be
baptized.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p29"></span>We know that unbelievers, Jews, and
Heathens were allowed in the Apostolic age to be present at times in the
Christian assemblies <span id="fr_84"></span>[85](#fn_84.md) ; and in
Cyril’s days they stood in the lower part of the Church (<span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.ii-p30.2"></span>νάρθηξ</span>) to hear
the Psalms, Lessons, and Sermon <span id="fr_85"></span>[86](#fn_85.md) .

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p32"></span>Any persons who by thus hearing the
word, or by other means, were brought to believe the truth of
Christianity, and to wish for further instruction, were strictly
examined as to their character, belief, and sincerity of purpose.  The
care with which such examinations were conducted is thus described by
Origen:  “The Christians, however, having previously, so far as
possible, tested the souls of those who wish to become their hearers,
and having previously admonished them in private, when they seem, before
entering the community, to have made sufficient progress in the desire
to lead a virtuous life, they then introduce them, having privately
formed one class of those who are just beginners, and are being
introduced, and have not yet received the mark of complete purification;
and another of those who have manifested to the best of their ability
the purpose of desiring no other things than are approved by
Christians <span id="fr_86"></span>[87](#fn_86.md) .”  Such as were thus
found worthy of admission were brought to the Bishop Presbyter, and
received by the sign of the Cross <span id="fr_87"></span>[88](#fn_87.md) ,
with prayer and imposition of hands, to the status of Catechumens.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p35"></span>We have a description by Eusebius <span
id="fr_88"></span>[89](#fn_88.md) of some of these ceremonies in the case
of Constantine:  When the Emperor felt his life to be drawing to a
close, “he poured forth his supplications and confessions to God,
kneeling on the pavement in the Church itself, in which he also now for
the first time received the imposition of hands with prayer.”  Soon
after this the Bishops whom he had summoned to Nicomedia to give him
Baptism, “performed the sacred ceremonies in the usual manner, and
having given him the necessary instructions made him a partaker of the
mystic ordinances.”

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p37"></span>Another ceremony used in the admission
of Catechumens, at least in some Churches, mentioned by S.
Augustine <span id="fr_89"></span>[90](#fn_89.md) :  “Sanctification is not
of one kind only:  for I suppose that Catechumens also are sanctified in
a certain way of their own by the sign of Christ’s Cross, and the Prayer
of the Imposition of Hands; and that which they receive, though it be
not the Body of Christ, is yet an holy thing, and more holy than the
common food which sustains us, because it is a sacrament.”  From this
passage it has been inferred that *consecrated bread* <span
id="page_xxiii">p. xxiii</span> <span
id="ii.iii.ii-Page_xxiii"></span>(<span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.ii-p38.1"></span>εὐλογίαι,</span> *panis benedictus*), taken
out of the oblations provided for the Eucharist, was given to the
Catechumens,—an opinion which seemed to have some support in the
comparison between “that which the Catechumens receive,” and “the food
which sustains us.”  But Bingham maintains <span
id="fr_90"></span>[91](#fn_90.md) that S. Augustine here refers only to the
symbolical use of salt, of which he says in his *Confessions*, I. xi.,
that while yet a boy he “used to be marked with the sign of His Cross,
and seasoned with His salt.”  The meaning of this so-called “Sacrament
of the Catechumens” was that by the symbol of salt “they might learn to
purge and cleanse their souls from sin.”

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p40"></span>In the African Church in the time of S.
Augustine it was customary to anoint the new convert with exorcised oil
at the time of his admission, but in the Eastern Church there seems to
have been no such anointing until immediately before Baptism.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p41"></span>Persons who had been thus admitted to
the class of Catechumens were usually regarded as Christians, but only
in a lower degree, being still clearly distinguished from the Faithful. 
“Ask a man, Art thou a Christian?  If he is a Pagan or a Jew, he
answers, I am not.  But if he say, I am, you ask him further, Catechumen
or Faithful?  If he answer, Catechumen, he has been anointed, but not
yet baptized <span id="fr_91"></span>[92](#fn_91.md) .”  Augustine, like
Tertullian, complains that among heretics there was no sure distinction
between the Catechumen and the Faithful <span
id="fr_92"></span>[93](#fn_92.md) :  and according to the second General
Council, *Canon* 7, converts from certain heresies to the orthodox Faith
were to be received only as heathen:  “On the first day we make them
Christians, on the second Catechumens, on the third we exorcise them by
three times breathing on them on the face and on the ears; and so we
instruct them (<span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.ii-p43.1"></span>κατηχοῦμεν</span>), and make them frequent
the Church for a long time, and listen to the Holy Scriptures, and then
we baptize them.”

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p44"></span>Whether Cyril calls his hearers
Christians before they had been baptized is not very clear:  in *Cat*.
x. § 16, he seems to include them among those who are called by the “new
name;” but in § 20 of the same Lecture he assumes that there may be
present some one who “was before a believer (<span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.ii-p44.1"></span>πιστός</span>),” and to him he says “Thou
wert called a Christian; be tender of the name,” and in Lect. xxi. i,
speaking to those who had now been baptized, he says, “Having therefore
become *partakers of Christ*, ye are properly called Christs.  Now ye
have been made Christs by receiving the antitype of the Holy Ghost,”
that is, Chrism.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p45"></span>§ 4.  *Candidates for Baptism*. 
Bingham, who himself makes four classes or degrees of Catechumens,
acknowledges that “the Greek expositors of the ancient Canons,” and
other writers, “usually make but two sorts <span
id="fr_93"></span>[94](#fn_93) .”  These were (1.md) the *imperfect* (<span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.ii-p46.1"></span>ἀ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.ii-p46.2"></span>τελέστεροι</span>),
called also hearers (<span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.ii-p46.3"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.ii-p46.4"></span>κροώμενοι</span> , *audientes*), because in
Church they were only allowed to remain till the Holy Scriptures had
been read, the Sermon preached, the special prayers of the Catechumens
said, and the blessing given to each by the Bishop in the words of the
“prayer of the imposition of hands <span id="fr_94"></span>[95](#fn_94.md)
.”  After this the Deacon says, “Go out, ye catechumens, in peace.” 
(2)  After the Energumens also have been dismissed, *the more perfect*
(<span class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.ii-p47.1"></span>τελειότεροι,
φωτιζόμενοι</span>) remain on their knees in prayer (<span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.ii-p47.2"></span>γονυκλίνοντες,
εὐχόμενοι</span>).  Then the Deacon is to cry aloud, “Ye that are to be
illuminated, pray.  Let us the faithful all pray for them.  And being
sealed to God through His Christ, let them bow down their heads, and
receive the blessing from the Bishop.”  The “Prayer of the Imposition of
hands” is then pronounced over them by the Bishop.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p48"></span>The period of probation and instruction
varied at different times and places:  according to Canon 42 of the
Synod of Elvira, 305, it was to be two years:  “He who has a good name,
<span id="page_xxiv">p. xxiv</span> <span
id="ii.iii.ii-Page_xxiv"></span>and wishes to become a Christian, must
be a Catechumen two years:  then he maybe baptized <span
id="fr_95"></span>[96](#fn_95.md) .”  After this probation had been
satisfactorily passed, the Catechumens invited to give in their names as
Candidates for Baptism.  This invitation, described by Cyril as a call
to military service (<span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.ii-p49.1"></span>κλῆσις στρατείας</span>) <span
id="fr_96"></span>[97](#fn_96.md) , appears to have been often repeated on
the approach of Lent.  Thus S. Ambrose, in his *Commentary on S. Luke*,
v. 5; *We have toiled all night and have taken nothing*, complains, “I
too, Lord, know that for me it is night, when I have not Thy command. 
No one yet has given his name:  with my voice I have cast the net
throughout Epiphany, and as yet I have taken nothing.”

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p51"></span>This preliminary “call to service” must
be distinguished from the actual enlistment in the Christian army at
Baptism, in anticipation of which Cyril prays for his hearers that God
“may enlist them in His service, and put on them the armour of
righteousness <span id="fr_97"></span>[98](#fn_97.md) .”  The same
metaphorical language in reference to the Christian warfare recurs in
many passages <span id="fr_98"></span>[99](#fn_98.md) .

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p54"></span>The next step for those who responded to
the call was the registration of names (<span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.ii-p54.1"></span>ὀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.ii-p54.2"></span>νοματογραφία</span> ) <span
id="fr_99"></span>[100](#fn_99.md) .  It appears from passages of Dionysius
Pseudo-Areopagites, quoted by Bingham <span
id="fr_100"></span>[101](#fn_100.md) , that the Bishop, after laying his
hand on each Catechumen’s head, commanded his Presbyters and Deacons to
register his name, together with that of his sponsor (<span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.ii-p56.1"></span>ἀ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.ii-p56.2"></span>νάδοχος</span>) in the
Diptychs of the living.  This ceremony took place at Jerusalem at the
beginning of Lent, as we learn from *Procat*. § 1:  “Thou hast entered,
been approved; thy name inscribed.…A long notice is allowed thee; thou
hast forty days for repentance.”  Those who had been admitted as
candidates for Baptism were in most Churches still reckoned among the
Catechumens, being distinguished as <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.ii-p56.3"></span>συναιτοῦντες</span> , “*competentes*.”  But
from Cyril’s language in several passages it appears that in the Church
of Jerusalem they ceased to be regarded as Catechumens, and were
reckoned among the Faithful.  “Thou wert called a Catechumen, while the
word echoed round thee from without.  Think not that thou receivest a
small thing:  though a miserable man, thou receivest one of God’s
titles.  Hear S. Paul saying, *God is faithful*.  But beware, lest thou
have the title of ‘faithful,’ but the will of the faithless <span
id="fr_101"></span>[102](#fn_101.md) .”  “Thou receivest a new name which
thou hadst not before.  Heretofore thou wast a Catechumen, but now thou
wilt be called a Believer (<span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.ii-p57.1"></span>Πιστός</span>) <span
id="fr_102"></span>[103](#fn_102.md) .”

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p59"></span>Again, “How great a dignity the Lord
bestows on you in transferring you from the order of Catechumens to that
of the Faithful, the Apostle Paul shews, when he affirms, *God is
faithful* <span id="fr_103"></span>[104](#fn_103.md) .”

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p61"></span>Two passages in S. Cyril have been
thought to imply that the newly-admitted Candidates for Baptism carried
lighted torches in procession, perhaps on the first Sunday after the
registration.  He speaks of their having received “torches of the bridal
procession <span id="fr_104"></span>[105](#fn_104.md) ;” and on this
expression the Benedictine Editor observes that “Wax tapers” were
perhaps given to the *Illuminandi* to carry, a custom which may also be
indicated in the words, “Ye who have lately lighted the torches of
faith, guard them carefully in your hands unquenched <span
id="fr_105"></span>[106](#fn_105.md) .”

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p64"></span>Others are of opinion that the custom of
carrying torches or tapers was observed only in the procession of the
newly-baptized from the Baptistery to the Church <span
id="fr_106"></span>[107](#fn_106.md) , and that here Cyril means by the
“bridal lamps,” those motions of the Holy Ghost, and spiritual
instructions, which had lighted their way to Christ, and to the entrance
to His Kingdom <span id="fr_107"></span>[108](#fn_107.md) .  This latter
interpretation is rather vague and far-fetched, and it is evident that
the words, “Ye who have lately lighted the torches of faith,” gain much
in clearness and force, if suggested by the visible symbolism of a
ceremony in which the *Illuminandi* had just borne their part.  The
<span id="page_xxv">p. xxv</span> <span
id="ii.iii.ii-Page_xxv"></span>lighted torches would be a significant
symbol both of the marriage of the soul with Christ, and of its
enlightenment by faith.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p67"></span>§ 5.  <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.ii-p67.1"></span>φωτιζόμενοι</span>.  In the first words of
his Introductory Lecture Cyril addresses his hearers as <span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.ii-p67.2"></span>οἱ φωτιζόμενοι</span>,
“Ye who are being enlightened,” and from the Titles of the Catechetical
Lectures i.–xviii., we see that this name was constantly used to
distinguish the candidates preparing for immediate Baptism.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p68"></span>The Verb <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.ii-p68.1"></span>φωτίζω</span> is frequently used by the
LXX., both in a physical and in a spiritual sense.  In the New Testament
it is found but rarely in the physical sense <span
id="fr_108"></span>[109](#fn_108.md) , being generally applied to the light
of spiritual truth, and to Christ as its source <span
id="fr_109"></span>[110](#fn_109.md) .

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p71"></span>In two passages of the Epistle to the
Hebrews, the Aorist (<span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.ii-p71.1"></span>φωτισθέντας</span> ) marks “the decisive
moment when the light was apprehended in its glory <span
id="fr_110"></span>[111](#fn_110.md) ,” from which the thought easily
passes on to the public profession of the truth thus received, that is,
to Baptism.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p73"></span>That the word began very early to be
used in this new sense, is evident from Justin Martyr’s explanation of
it in his *First Apology*, c. 61; where, after speaking of instruction
in Christian doctrine, of the profession of faith, and the promise of
repentance and holy living, as the necessary preparations for Baptism,
he thus proceeds:  “And this washing is called Illumination (<span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.ii-p73.1"></span>σωτισμός</span>),
because they who learn these things are illuminated in their
understanding. <span id="fr_111"></span>[112](#fn_111.md) ”  The same
transition of the meaning from instruction to Baptism is clearly implied
by Clement of Alexandria:  “Among the barbarian philosophers also to
instruct and to enlighten is called to regenerate <span
id="fr_112"></span>[113](#fn_112.md) ,” and again:  “For this reason the
teaching, which made manifest the hidden things, has been called
illumination (<span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.ii-p75.1"></span>φωτισμός</span>) <span
id="fr_113"></span>[114](#fn_113.md) .”

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p77"></span>That this is the sense in which Cyril
uses the word is placed beyond doubt by a passage of the Lecture
delivered immediately before the administration of Baptism:  “that your
soul being *previously illuminated* (<span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.ii-p77.1"></span>προφωτιζομένης</span> ) by the word of
doctrine, ye may in each particular discover the greatness of the gifts
bestowed on you by God <span id="fr_114"></span>[115](#fn_114.md) .”

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p79"></span>We thus see that the Present Participle
(<span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.ii-p79.1"></span>φωτιζόμενοι</span>) describes a process of
gradual illumination during the course of instruction, to be completed
in Baptism, a sense which is well expressed in the Latin Gerundive
“Illuminandi.”  And as we have seen that the candidates are addressed as
<span class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.ii-p79.2"></span>οἱ
φωτιζόμενοι</span> even before the course of instruction has commenced,
the quasi-Future sense “follows necessarily from the context <span
id="fr_115"></span>[116](#fn_115.md) .”

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p81"></span>The spiritual “Illumination,” of which
Baptism was to be the completion and the seal, thus became by a natural
development one of the recognised names of Baptism itself.  On the
contrary, the inverse process assumed by the Benedictine Editor is
entirely unnatural.  Starting from the later ecclesiastical use of <span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.ii-p81.1"></span>φωτίζω</span> and <span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.ii-p81.2"></span>φωτισμός</span> as
connoting Baptism, he supposes that this was the first application of
those terms, and that they were transferred to the previous illumination
acquired by instruction in Christian truth, only because this was a
necessary preparation for Baptism.  He therefore maintains that <span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.ii-p81.3"></span>φωτιζόμενοι</span>
throughout the Catechetical Lectures is another term for <span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.ii-p81.4"></span>βαπτιζόμενοι</span>: 
and as a decisive proof of this he refers to *Cat*. xvi. 26:  <span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.ii-p81.5"></span>μέλλει δὲ καὶ ἐπὶ σὲ τὸν
βαπτιζόμενον φθάνειν ἡ χάρις</span>, not observing that the grace is to
come upon “the person being baptized” at a time still future.  This
meaning of the passage is made absolutely certain by the words which
immediately follow,—“But in what manner I say not, for I will not
anticipate the proper season.”  We may conclude, therefore, that in
Cyril’s Lectures the term <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.ii-p81.6"></span>οἱ φωτιζόμενοι</span> refers to the
preparatory course of enlightenment rather than to Baptism.  At the same
time we must remember that in Cyril’s day, and long before, <span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.ii-p81.7"></span>φωτίζω</span>, <span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.ii-p81.8"></span>φωτισμός</span>, and
<span class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.ii-p81.9"></span>φώτισμα</span>
were constantly used to denote Baptism <span id="page_xxvi">p.
xxvi</span> <span id="ii.iii.ii-Page_xxvi"></span>itself, as being the
time of special illumination by the grace of the Holy Spirit then
given.  Thus Clement of Alexandria writes:  “In Baptism we are
illuminated.…This work is variously called grace, and illumination
(<span class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.ii-p81.10"></span>φώτισμα</span>),
and perfection, and washing:…illumination, by which that holy light of
salvation is beheld, that is, by which we see God clearly <span
id="fr_116"></span>[117](#fn_116.md) .”  Gregory Nazianzen speaks in the
same way:  “We call it gift, grace, baptism, chrism, illumination,
garment of incorruption, washing of regeneration, seal, all that is
precious <span id="fr_117"></span>[118](#fn_117.md) .”
