id="iv.iv.vi.ii-p1.1"></span>Ep. XCI.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.vi.ii-p2"></span>(A letter of no great importance,
except as shewing the friendly feelings which Gregory continued to
maintain towards his successor.)

<span id="iv.iv.vi.ii-p3"></span>Affairs with us go on as usual:  we are
quiet without strifes and disputes, valuing as we do the reward (which
has no risk attaching to it) of silence, beyond everything.  And we have
derived some profit from this rest, having by God’s mercy fairly
recovered from our illness.  Do <span id="page_470">p. 470</span> <span
id="iv.iv.vi.ii-Page_470"></span>you ride on and reign, as holy David
says, <span id="fr_4749"></span>[4750](#fn_4749.md) and may God, Who has
honoured you with Priesthood, accompany you throughout, and set it for
you above all slander.  And that we may give each other a proof of our
courage, and may not suffer any human calamity as we stand before God, I
send this message to you, and do you promptly assent to it.  There are
many reasons which make me very anxious about our very dear Pancratius. 
Be good enough to receive him kindly, and to commend him to the best of
your friends, that he may attain his object.  His object is through some
kind of military service to obtain relief from public office, though
there is no single kind of life that is unexposed to the slanders of
worthless men, as you very well know.
