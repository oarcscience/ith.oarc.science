<span id="iv.iii.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.iii.xiv-p1.1"></span>Ep. XLII.  To Eusebius, Bishop of
Samosata.</span>

<span id="iv.iii.xiv-p2"></span>(There still seemed a probability that
intrigues and party spirit would carry the day, and so the two Gregories
determined to call in the aid of Eusebius of Samosata, though he did not
belong to the Province.  He had been a conspicuous champion of orthodoxy
against the Arian Emperor Valens, and the Gregories hoped much from his
presence at the Synod.  He responded to their appeal, and undertook the
three hundred miles of very difficult travelling to throw in his
influence with the cause which they had at heart.  He saw, however, that
it was necessary that the aged Bishop of Nazianzus, notwithstanding his
years and infirmities, should make the effort, and he persuaded him to
go.  The result was all that could be desired; for Basil was elected by
a unanimous vote.  The letter, which S. Gregory wrote in his own name to
thank him, will be found later on.)

<span id="iv.iii.xiv-p3"></span>O that I had the wings of a dove, or
that my old age could be renewed, that I might be able to go to your
charity, and to satisfy the longings that I have to see you, and to tell
you the troubles of my soul, and in you to find some comfort for my
afflictions.  For since the death of the blessed Bishop Eusebius I am
not a little afraid lest they who on a former occasion set traps for our
Metropolis, and wanted to fill it with heretical tares, should now seize
the opportunity, and uproot by their evil teaching the piety which has
with so much labour been sown in the hearts of men, and should tear
asunder its unity, as they have done in many Churches.  As soon as I
received letters from the Clergy asking me not to forget them in their
present circumstances, I looked round about me, and remembered your love
and your right faith and the zeal with which you are ever possessed for
the Churches of God; and therefore I sent my beloved Eustathius, my
Deacon and helper, to warn your Reverence, and to entreat you, in
addition to all your toils for the Churches, to meet me, and both to
refresh my old age by your coming, and to establish in the Orthodox
Church that piety which is so famous, by giving her with us (if we may
be deemed worthy to have a share with you in the good work) a Shepherd
according to the will of the Lord, who shall be able to rule His
people.  For we have a <span id="page_452">p. 452</span> <span
id="iv.iii.xiv-Page_452"></span>man before our eyes, and you are not
unacquainted with him; and if we are permitted to obtain him I know that
we shall acquire great boldness towards God, and shall confer a very
great benefit upon the people who have called upon our aid.  I beg you
again and again to put away all delay, and to come to us before the bad
weather of the winter sets in.
