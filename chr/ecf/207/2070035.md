<span id="ii.xxiii-p7"></span><span class="c21"><span
id="ii.xxiii-p7.1"></span>Lecture XIX.</span>

<span id="ii.xxiii-p8"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="ii.xxiii-p8.1"></span>First Lecture on the Mysteries.</span>

<span id="ii.xxiii-p9"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.xxiii-p9.1"></span>With a Lesson from the</span> <span
id="ii.xxiii-p9.2"></span>First General Epistle of Peter<span
class="sc"><span id="ii.xxiii-p9.3"></span>, beginning at</span> *Be
sober, be vigilant*<span class="sc"><span id="ii.xxiii-p9.4"></span>, to
the end of the Epistle.</span>

<span id="ii.xxiii-p10"></span>1.  <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.xxiii-p10.1"></span>I have</span> long been wishing, O true-born
and dearly beloved children of the Church, to discourse to you
concerning these spiritual and heavenly Mysteries; but since I well knew
that seeing is far more persuasive than hearing, I waited for the
present season; that finding you more open to the influence of my words
from your present experience, I might lead you by the hand into the
brighter and more fragrant meadow of the Paradise before us; especially
as ye have been made fit to receive the more sacred Mysteries, after
having been found worthy of divine and life-giving Baptism <span
id="fr_2357"></span>[2358](#fn_2357.md) .  Since therefore it remains to
set before you a table of the more perfect instructions, let us now
teach you these things exactly, that ye may know the effect <span
id="fr_2358"></span>[2359](#fn_2358.md) wrought upon you on that evening of
your baptism.

<span id="ii.xxiii-p13"></span>2.  First ye entered into the
vestibule <span id="fr_2359"></span>[2360](#fn_2359.md) of the Baptistery,
and there facing towards the West ye listened to the command to stretch
forth your hand, and as in the presence of Satan ye renounced him.  Now
ye must know that this figure is found in ancient history.  For when
Pharaoh, that most bitter and cruel tyrant, was oppressing the free and
high-born people of the Hebrews, God sent Moses to bring them out of the
evil bondage of the Egyptians.  Then the door posts were anointed with
the blood of a lamb, that the destroyer might flee from the houses which
had the sign of the blood; and the Hebrew people was marvellously
delivered.  The enemy, however, after their rescue, *pursued after
them* <span id="fr_2360"></span>[2361](#fn_2360.md) , and saw the sea
wondrously parted for them; nevertheless he went on, following close in
their footsteps, and was all at once overwhelmed and engulphed in the
Red Sea.

<span id="ii.xxiii-p16"></span>3.  Now turn from the old to the new,
from the figure to the reality.  There we have Moses sent from God to
Egypt; here, Christ, sent forth from His Father into the world:  there,
that Moses might lead forth an afflicted people out of Egypt; here, that
Christ might rescue those who are oppressed in the world under sin: 
there, the blood of a lamb was the spell against <span
id="fr_2361"></span>[2362](#fn_2361.md) the destroyer; here, the blood of
the Lamb without blemish Jesus Christ is made the charm to scare <span
id="fr_2362"></span>[2363](#fn_2362.md) evil spirits:  there, the tyrant
<span id="page_145">p. 145</span> <span
id="ii.xxiii-Page_145"></span>was pursuing that ancient people even to
the sea; and here the daring and shameless spirit, the author of evil,
was following thee even to the very streams of salvation.  The tyrant of
old was drowned in the sea; and this present one disappears in the water
of salvation.

<span id="ii.xxiii-p21"></span>4.  But nevertheless thou art bidden to
say, with arm outstretched towards him as though he were present, “I
renounce thee, Satan.”  I wish also to say wherefore ye stand facing to
the West; for it is necessary.  Since the West is the region of sensible
darkness, and he being darkness has his dominion also in darkness,
therefore, looking with a symbolical meaning towards the West, ye
renounce that dark and gloomy potentate.  What then did each of you
stand up and say?  “I renounce thee, Satan,”—thou wicked and most cruel
tyrant! meaning, “I fear thy might no longer; for that Christ hath
overthrown, having partaken with me of flesh and blood, that through
these He *might by death destroy death* <span
id="fr_2363"></span>[2364](#fn_2363.md) , that I might not be made *subject
to bondage* for ever.”  “I renounce thee,”—thou crafty and most subtle
serpent.  “I renounce thee,”—plotter as thou art, who under the guise of
friendship didst contrive all disobedience, and work apostasy in our
first parents.  “I renounce thee, Satan,”—the artificer and abettor of
all wickedness.

<span id="ii.xxiii-p23"></span>5.  Then in a second sentence thou art
taught to say, “and all thy works.”  Now the works of Satan are all sin,
which also thou must renounce;—just as one who has escaped a tyrant has
surely escaped his weapons also.  All sin therefore, of every kind, is
included in the works of the devil.  Only know this; that all that thou
sayest, especially at that most thrilling hour, is written in God’s
books; when therefore thou doest any thing contrary to these promises,
thou shalt be judged as a *transgressor* <span
id="fr_2364"></span>[2365](#fn_2364.md) .  Thou renouncest therefore the
works of Satan; I mean, all deeds and thoughts which are contrary to
reason.

<span id="ii.xxiii-p25"></span>6.  Then thou sayest, “And all his
pomp <span id="fr_2365"></span>[2366](#fn_2365.md) .”  Now the pomp of the
devil is the madness of theatres <span
id="fr_2366"></span>[2367](#fn_2366.md) , and horse-races, and hunting, and
all such vanity:  from which that holy man praying to be delivered says
unto God, *Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity* <span
id="fr_2367"></span>[2368](#fn_2367.md) .  Be not interested in the madness
of the theatre, where thou wilt behold the wanton gestures of the
players <span id="fr_2368"></span>[2369](#fn_2368.md) , carried on with
mockeries and all unseemliness, and the frantic dancing of effeminate
men <span id="fr_2369"></span>[2370](#fn_2369.md) ;—nor in the madness of
them who in hunts <span id="fr_2370"></span>[2371](#fn_2370.md) expose
themselves to wild beasts, that they may pamper their miserable
appetite; who, to serve their belly with meats, become themselves in
reality meat for the belly of untamed beasts; and to speak justly, for
the sake of their own god, their belly, they cast away their life
headlong in single combats <span id="fr_2371"></span>[2372](#fn_2371.md) . 
Shun also horse-races, that frantic and soul-subverting spectacle <span
id="fr_2372"></span>[2373](#fn_2372.md) .  For all these are the pomp of
the devil.

<span id="ii.xxiii-p43"></span>7.  Moreover, the things which are hung
up at idol festivals <span id="fr_2373"></span>[2374](#fn_2373.md) , either
meat or bread, or other such things polluted by the invocation of the
unclean spirits, are reckoned in the pomp of the devil.  For as the
Bread and Wine of the Eucharist <span id="page_146">p. 146</span> <span
id="ii.xxiii-Page_146"></span>before the invocation of the Holy and
Adorable Trinity were simple bread and wine, while after the invocation
the Bread becomes the Body of Christ, and the Wine the Blood of
Christ <span id="fr_2374"></span>[2375](#fn_2374.md) , so in like manner
such meats belonging to the pomp of Satan, though in their own nature
simple, become profane by the invocation of the evil spirit.

<span id="ii.xxiii-p46"></span>8.  After this thou sayest, “and all thy
service <span id="fr_2375"></span>[2376](#fn_2375.md) .”  Now the service
of the devil is prayer in idol temples; things done in honour of
lifeless idols; the lighting of lamps <span
id="fr_2376"></span>[2377](#fn_2376.md) , or burning of incense by
fountains or rivers <span id="fr_2377"></span>[2378](#fn_2377.md) , as some
persons cheated by dreams or by evil spirits do \[resort to this <span
id="fr_2378"></span>[2379](#fn_2378.md) \], thinking to find a cure even
for their bodily ailments.  Go not after such things.  The watching of
birds, divination, omens, or amulets, or charms written on leaves,
sorceries, or other evil arts <span id="fr_2379"></span>[2380](#fn_2379.md)
, and all such things, are services of the devil; therefore shun them. 
For if after renouncing Satan and associating thyself with Christ <span
id="fr_2380"></span>[2381](#fn_2380.md) , thou fall under their influence,
thou shalt find <span id="fr_2381"></span>[2382](#fn_2381.md) the tyrant
more bitter; perchance, because he treated thee of old as his own, and
relieved thee from his hard bondage, but has now been greatly
exasperated by thee; so thou wilt be bereaved of Christ, and have
experience of the other.  Hast thou not heard the old history which
tells us of Lot and his daughters?  Was not he himself saved with his
daughters, when he had gained the mountain, while his wife became a
pillar of salt, set up as a monument for ever, in remembrance of her
depraved will and her turning back.  Take heed therefore to thyself, and
turn not again to *what is behind* <span
id="fr_2382"></span>[2383](#fn_2382.md) , having put thine hand to the
plough, and then turning back to the salt savour of this life’s doings;
but escape to the mountain, to Jesus Christ, that *stone hewn without
hands* <span id="fr_2383"></span>[2384](#fn_2383.md) , which has filled the
world.

<span id="ii.xxiii-p56"></span>9.  When therefore thou renouncest Satan,
utterly breaking all thy covenant with him, that ancient *league with
hell* <span id="fr_2384"></span>[2385](#fn_2384.md) , there is opened to
thee the paradise of God, which He planted towards the East, whence for
his transgression our first father was banished; and a symbol of this
was thy turning from West to East, the place of light <span
id="fr_2385"></span>[2386](#fn_2385.md) .  Then thou wert told to say, “I
believe in the Father, and in the Son, and in the Holy Ghost, and in one
Baptism of repentance <span id="fr_2386"></span>[2387](#fn_2386.md) .”  Of
which things we spoke to thee at length in the former Lectures, as God’s
grace allowed us.

<span id="ii.xxiii-p60"></span>10.  Guarded therefore by these
discourses, *be sober*.  *For* our *adversary the devil*, as was just
now read, *as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may
devour* <span id="fr_2387"></span>[2388](#fn_2387.md) .  But though in
former times death was mighty and devoured, at the holy Laver of
regeneration God has *wiped away every tear from off all faces* <span
id="fr_2388"></span>[2389](#fn_2388.md) .  For thou shalt no more mourn,
now that thou hast put off the old man; but thou shalt keep
holy-day <span id="fr_2389"></span>[2390](#fn_2389.md) , *clothed in the
garment of salvation* <span id="fr_2390"></span>[2391](#fn_2390.md) , even
Jesus Christ.

<span id="ii.xxiii-p65"></span>11.  And these things were done in the
outer chamber.  But if God will, when in the succeeding lectures on the
Mysteries we have entered into the Holy of Holies <span
id="fr_2391"></span>[2392](#fn_2391.md) , we shall there know the
symbolical meaning of the things which are there performed.  Now to God
the Father, with the Son and the Holy Ghost, be glory, and power, and
majesty, forever and ever.  Amen.

end of the Epistle,” there follows the statement “Of the same author
Cyril, and of John the Bishop” (Bened. Ed.).  See Index, *Authenticity*.

<span id="ii.xxiii-p14"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.xxiii-p14.1"></span>τὁν προαύλιον</span>, called below in § 11
“the outer chamber.”  Cf. Procat. § 1, note 3.  It appears from
Tertullian, *De Corona,* § 3, that the renunciation was made first in
the Church, and afterwards in the Baptistery:  “When we are going to
enter the water, at that moment as well as just before in the Church
under the hand of the President, we solemnly profess that we disown the
devil, and his pomp, and his angels.”

<span id="ii.xxiii-p18"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.xxiii-p18.1"></span>φυγαδευτήριον</span>, the word commonly used
in the Septuagint for “a city of refuge.”  But the Verb <span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.xxiii-p18.2"></span>φυγαδεύω</span> is
Transitive in [2 Macc. ix. 4](../../../bib/apo/ma2009.htm#004.md)<span
id="ii.xxiii-p18.3"></span>, as well as in Xenophon and Demosthenes. 
The application of the blood of Christ in Baptism is represented by
marking the sign of the Cross on the forehead.  Compare the lines of
Prudentius quoted by the Benedictine Editor:

<span id="ii.xxiii-p19"></span>“Passio quæ nostram defendit sanguine
frontem,

<span id="ii.xxiii-p20"></span>Corporeamque domum signato collinit ore.”

<span id="ii.xxiii-p26"></span> Herod. II. 58:  “The Egyptians were the
first to introduce solemn assemblies (<span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.xxiii-p26.1"></span>πανηγύρις</span>) and processions (<span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.xxiii-p26.2"></span>πομπάς</span>).”  At Rome
the term “pompa” was applied especially to the procession with which the
Ludi Circenses were opened and also to any grand ceremony or pageant.

<span id="fn_2366"></span>[145:2367](2070035.htm#fr_2366.md) <span

<span id="ii.xxiii-p27"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.xxiii-p27.1"></span>θεατρομανίαι</span>.  Cf. Tertull.
*Apologet*. 38; “We renounce all your spectacles.…Among us nothing is
ever said, or seen, or heard, which has anything in common with the
madness of the Circus, the immodesty of the theatre, the atrocities of
the arena, the useless exercises of the wrestling-ground.”  He calls the
theatre “that citadel of all impurities,” *De Spectaculis*, c. 10,
“immodesty’s peculiar abode,” c. 17, and gives a vivid description of
the rage and fury of the Circus in c. 16.

<span id="fn_2367"></span>[145:2368](2070035.htm#fr_2367.md) <span

id="ii.xxiii-p28.2"></span>

<span id="ii.xxiii-p29"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.xxiii-p29.1"></span>μίμων</span>, the name either of a species of
low comedy, “consisting more of gestures and mimicry than of spoken
dialogue,” or of the persons who acted in them.  Cyril’s description of
the coarse and indecent character of the mimes is more than justified by
the impartial testimony of Ovid, *Trist*. ii. 497:

<span id="ii.xxiii-p30"></span>“Quid si scripsissem mimos obscœna
jocantes,

<span id="ii.xxiii-p31"></span>Qui semper vetiti crimen amoris habent;

<span id="ii.xxiii-p32"></span>In quibus assidue cultus procedit
adulter,

<span id="ii.xxiii-p33"></span>Verbaque dat stulto callida nupta viro.

<span id="ii.xxiii-p34"></span>Nubilis hos virgo, matronaque, virque,
puerque

<span id="ii.xxiii-p35"></span>Spectat, et e magna parte Senatus adest.

<span id="ii.xxiii-p36"></span>Nec satis incestis temerari vocibus
aures;

<span id="ii.xxiii-p37"></span>Assuescunt oculi multa pudenda pati.”

<span id="ii.xxiii-p38"></span>A theatre is mentioned as one of the
buildings erected by Hadrian in his new City Aelia Capitolina built on
the site of Jerusalem; and that theatrical performances were continued
in the time of Cyril we know from the accusation that in a time of
famine he had sold one of the Church vestments, which was afterwards
used upon the stage.

<span id="fn_2369"></span>[145:2370](2070035.htm#fr_2369.md) <span
id="ii.xxiii-p38.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxiii-p39"></span> Lactantius, *Epitome*, § 63: 
“Histrionici etiam impudici gestus, quibus infames fœminas imitantur,
libidines, quæ saltando exprimunt, docent.”

<span id="fn_2370"></span>[145:2371](2070035.htm#fr_2370.md) <span
id="ii.xxiii-p39.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxiii-p40"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.xxiii-p40.1"></span>κυνηγεσίαις</span>, the so-called
“venationes” of the Circus in which the “bestiarii” fought with wild
beasts.

<span id="fn_2371"></span>[145:2372](2070035.htm#fr_2371.md) <span
id="ii.xxiii-p40.2"></span>

<span id="ii.xxiii-p41"></span> The “bestiarii” were feasted in public
on the day before their encounter with the beasts.  See Tertull.
*Apologet*. § 42:  “I do not recline in public at the feast of Bacchus,
after the manner of the beast-fighters at their last banquet.”  Ib. §
9:  “Those also who dine on the flesh of wild beasts from the arena, who
have keen appetites for bear and stag.”  These latter, however, were
chiefly the poor, to whom flesh was a rarity:  Apuleius *Metam*. iv. 14,
quoted by Oehler.

<span id="fn_2372"></span>[145:2373](2070035.htm#fr_2372.md) <span
id="ii.xxiii-p41.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxiii-p42"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.xxiii-p42.1"></span>ψυχὰς ἐκτραχήλιζον</span>, an allusion to the
risk of a broken neck in the chariot-race.  Tertull. *de Spectaculis*, §
9:  “Equestrianism was formerly practised in a simple way on horseback,
and certainly its ordinary use was innocent:  but when it was dragged
into the games, it passed from a gift of God into the service of
demons.”  The presiding deity of the chariot-race was Poseidon (Hom.
*Il*. xxiii, 307; Pind. *Ol*. i. 63; *Pyth*. vi. 50; Soph. Œdip. Col.
712<span id="ii.xxiii-p42.2"></span>), and both this and the other shows
of the Circus, and of the theatre, were connected with the worship of
the gods of Greece and Rome, and therefore forbidden as idolatrous: 
“What high religious rites, what sacrifices precede, intervene, and
follow, how many guilds, how many priesthoods, how many services are set
astir” (Tert. *de Spect*. § 7).

<span id="fn_2373"></span>[145:2374](2070035.htm#fr_2373.md) <span
id="ii.xxiii-p43.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxiii-p44"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.xxiii-p44.1"></span>πανηγύρεσι</span>.  The Panegyris was
strictly a religious festival, but was commonly accompanied by a great
fair or market, in which were sold not only such things as the
worshippers might need for their offerings, e.g. frankincense, but also
the flesh of the animals which had been sacrificed.  Cf. *Dictionary of
Greek and Rom. Antiq*. “Panegyris.”  Tertull. *Apolog*. § 42:  “We do
not go to your spectacles:  yet the articles that are sold there, if I

<span id="ii.xxiii-p47"></span> The form of renunciation before Baptism
is given in the *Apostolic Constitutions*, VII. 41:  “I renounce Satan,
and his works, and his pomps, and his services, and his angels, and his
inventions, and all things that are under him.”  Cf. Tertull. *De
Spectaculis*, § 4:  “When on entering the water, we make profession of
the Christian faith in the words of its rule, we bear public testimony
that we have renounced the devil, his pomp, and his angels.”

assembly takes place for the sacrifices (to Minerva, or Neith), there is
one night on which the inhabitants all burn a multitude of lights in the
open air round their houses.…These burn the whole night, and give to the
festival the name of the Feast of Lamps (<span class="Greek"><span

his day the form of interrogation at Baptism was fixed and definite.  He
speaks of the “usitata et legitima verba interrogationis,”—and we know
as distinctly that the interrogation included the words, “Dost thou
believe in God the Father, in His Son Christ, in the Holy Spirit?  Dost
thou believe in remission of sins and eternal life through the Church?”
