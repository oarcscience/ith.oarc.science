<span id="iv.iii.xx-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.iii.xx-p1.1"></span>Ep. L.  To Basil.</span>

<span id="iv.iii.xx-p2"></span>(At the request of Anthimus it would
appear that S. Gregory wrote to S. Basil a letter, not now extant,
proposing a conference between the rival Metropolitans.  Basil took
umbrage at the well-meant proposal, and wrote a stiff letter to S.
Gregory, to which the following is the reply.)

<span id="iv.iii.xx-p3"></span>How hotly and like a colt you skip in
your letters.  Nor do I wonder that when you have just become the
property of glory you should wish to shew me what you find glory to be,
so that you may make yourself more majestic, like those painters who
picture the seasons.  But, to explain the whole matter about the
Bishops, and the letter by which you were annoyed; what was my starting
point, and how far I went, and where I stopped, appears to me to be too
long a matter for a letter, and to be a subject not so much for an
apology as for a history.  To explain it to you concisely:—the most
noble Anthimus came to us with certain Bishops, whether to visit my
Father (this at least was the pretext), or to act as he did act.  He
sounded me in many ways and on many subjects; dioceses, the marshes of
Sasima, my ordination,…flattering, questioning, threatening, pleading,
blaming, praising, drawing circles round himself, as though I ought only
to look at him and his new Metropolis, as being the greater.  Why, I
said, do you draw your line to include our city, for we too deem our
Church to be really a Mother of Churches, and that too from ancient
times?  In the end he went away without having gained his object, much
out of breath, and reproaching me with Basilism, as if it were a kind of
Philipism.  Do you think I did you wrong in this?  And now look at the
letter from me, who, you say, insulted you.  They fashioned a Synodal
summons to me; and when I declined it and said that the thing was an
insult, they then asked as an alternative that through me you should be
invited to deliberate upon these matters.  This I promised, in order to
prevent their first plan being carried out; placing the whole matter in
your hands, if you choose to call them together, and where and when. 
And if I have not injured you in this, tell me where there is room for
injury.  If you have to learn this from me, I will read you the letter
which Anthimus sent me, after invading the marshes, notwithstanding my
prohibitions and threats, insulting and reviling me, and as it were
singing a song of triumph over my defeat.  And what reason is there that
I should offend him for your sake and at the same time displease you, as
though I were currying favour with him?  You ought to have learnt this
first, my dear friend; and even if it had been so, you should not have
insulted me,—if only because I am a Priest.  But if you are very much
disposed to ostentation and quarrelsomeness, and speak as my Superior—as
the Metropolitan to an insignificant Suffragan, or even as to a Bishop
without a See—I too have a little pride to set against yours.  That is
very easy to anybody, and is perhaps the most suitable course.
