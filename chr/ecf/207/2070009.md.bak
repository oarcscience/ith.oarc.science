<span id="ii.iii.v-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="ii.iii.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter V.—Eucharistic Rites.  Liturgy.</span>

<span id="ii.iii.v-p2"></span>§ 1.  *First Communion*.  When the rites
of Baptism and Chrism were completed, the new-made Christians, clothed
in white robes (*Myst*. iv. 8), and bearing each a lighted taper in his
hand, passed in procession from the Baptistery into the great “Church of
the Resurrection.”  The time was still night, as we gather from the
allusion in *Procat*., § 15:  “May God at length shew you that night,
that darkness which shines like the day, concerning which it is said,
darkness shall not be hidden from thee, and the night shall be light as
the day.”  As the newly-baptized entered the church, they were welcomed
in the words of the 32nd Psalm.  “Even now,” says Cyril (*Procat*., §
15), “let your ears ring, as it were, with that glorious sound, when
over your salvation the Angels shall chant, *Blessed are they whose
iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered*; when like stars of
the Church you shall enter in, bright in the body and radiant in the
soul.”  During the chanting of the Psalm the neophytes seem to have
stood in front of the raised ‘bema’ or sanctuary, as we learn from
Cyril’s eloquent contemporary, Gregory Nazianzen, *Orat*. XL. § 46: 
“The station in which presently after Baptism thou wilt stand before the
great sanctuary prefigures the glory from yonder heaven; the psalmody,
with which thou wilt be welcomed, is a prelude of those heavenly hymns;
the lamps, which thou wilt light, are a mystic sign of the procession of
lights, with which bright and virgin souls shall go forth to meet the
Bridegroom, with the lamps of faith burning brightly.”

<span id="ii.iii.v-p3"></span>From the Syriac “Treatise of Severus,
formerly Patriarch of Alexandria (Antioch), concerning the rites of
Baptism and of Holy Communion (Synaxis) as received among the Syrian
Christians” (Resch, *Agrapha*, § 12, p. 361); we learn that it was the
custom “to lift up the newly-baptized to the altar, and after giving
them the mysteries the Bishop (*Sacerdos*) crowned them with garlands.”

<span id="ii.iii.v-p4"></span>The white garments (*Procat*., § 2: 
*Mystag*., iv. 88) were worn until the Octave of Easter, Low Sunday,
*Dominica in Albis* (Bingham, XII. c. iv. § 3).

<span id="ii.iii.v-p5"></span>§ 2.  <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iii.v-p5.1"></span>The Liturgy</span>.  In Cyril’s last Lecture,
*Mystagogic* V., he reminds his hearers of what they had witnessed at
their first Communion on Easter-day, and thus gives a most valuable
testimony to the prescribed form of administering the Holy Eucharist in
the Eastern Church in the middle of the fourth century.

<span id="ii.iii.v-p6"></span>Passing over all the preparatory portion
of the Liturgy, he tells us first that the Deacon brings water to the
Bishop or Priest (<span class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.v-p6.1"></span>τῷ
ἱερεῖ</span>) and to the Presbyters who stand round the altar, that they
may wash their hands in token of the need of purification from sin; a
ceremony which evidently had reference to the words of the Psalmist, “I
will wash mine hands in innocency; so will I compass Thine altar, O
Lord <span id="fr_218"></span>[219](#fn_218.md) .”  In some Churches,
perhaps also at Jerusalem, the words were actually chanted during the
ablution <span id="fr_219"></span>[220](#fn_219.md) .

<span id="ii.iii.v-p9"></span>“Then the Deacon cries aloud, Receive ye
one another:  and let us salute (<span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.v-p9.1"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.v-p9.2"></span>σπαζώμεθα</span> ) one another.”  In the
Clementine Liturgy <span id="fr_220"></span>[221](#fn_220.md) the “Kiss of
Peace” precedes the “Ablution.”

<span id="ii.iii.v-p11"></span><span id="page_xxxv">p. xxxv</span> <span
id="ii.iii.v-Page_xxxv"></span>Sometimes these two sentences are
combined:  “Salute ye one another with the holy kiss <span
id="fr_221"></span>[222](#fn_221.md) .”  In the Liturgy of S. James there
are two separate rubrics, one immediately after the dismissal of the
Catechumens, “Take knowledge one of another,” and a second after the
Creed, “Let us embrace (<span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.v-p12.1"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.v-p12.2"></span>γαπήσωμεν</span>) one another with a holy
kiss.”

<span id="ii.iii.v-p13"></span>“After this the Priest (<span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.v-p13.1"></span>ἱ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.v-p13.2"></span>ερεύς</span>) cries
aloud, Lift up your hearts.  Then ye answer, We lift them up unto the
Lord <span id="fr_222"></span>[223](#fn_222.md) .”

<span id="ii.iii.v-p15"></span>The meaning of this Preface, as explained
by Cyril, is an exhortation by the Priest, or Bishop when present, and a
promise by the people, to raise all their thoughts to God on high, in
preparation for the great Thanksgiving to which they were further
invited:  “Let us give thanks unto the Lord,”—“It is meet and
right <span id="fr_223"></span>[224](#fn_223.md) .”

<span id="ii.iii.v-p17"></span>Then follows a very brief summary of the
Eucharistic Preface, and after that the Trisagion <span
id="fr_224"></span>[225](#fn_224.md) , corresponding in part to the long
Thanksgiving in the *Apostolic Constitutions* for all God’s mercies in
creation, providence, and redemption <span
id="fr_225"></span>[226](#fn_225.md) .

<span id="ii.iii.v-p20"></span>It is important to observe how S. Cyril
in this and the following sections associates the people with the
Priest, using throughout the Plural “We.”  That this is intentional and
significant, we may learn from a passage of S. Chrysostom <span
id="fr_226"></span>[227](#fn_226.md) which is so interesting that we may be
allowed to translate it at length:  “Sometimes moreover no difference is
made between the Priest and those over whom he presides, as for example
when we are to partake of the awful mysteries; for we are all alike
deemed worthy of the same privileges:  not as in the Old Covenant some
parts were eaten by the Priest, and others by the governed (<span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.v-p21.1"></span>ὁ</span> <span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.v-p21.2"></span>ἀρχόμενος</span>), and it
was not lawful for the people to share in what the Priest partook of. 
It is not so now:  but one Body is set before all, and one Cup.  And in
the prayers also one may see the laity contributing much.  For the
prayers on behalf of the Energumens, and on behalf of those in Penitence
are offered in common both by the Priest and by themselves; and all say
one prayer, a prayer that is full of compassion.  Again, after we have
excluded from the sacred precincts those who are unable to partake of
the Holy Table, there is another prayer to be made, and we all alike lie
prostrate on the floor, and all alike rise up.  When again we are to
receive and give a kiss of peace, we all alike embrace each other. 
Again even amid the most tremendous Mysteries the Priest prays over the
people, and the people over the Priest:  for the formula, “With Thy
Spirit,” is nothing else than this.  The words of the Thanksgiving again
are common:  for he does not give thanks alone, but also the whole
people.  For having first got their answer, and they agreeing that ‘It
is meet and right so to do,’ he then begins the thanksgiving.  And why
wonder that the people sometimes speak with the Priest, when even with
the very Cherubim and the Powers on high they send up those sacred hymns
in common.  Now all this I have said in order that each of the common
people (<span class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.v-p21.3"></span>τῶν
ἀρχομένων</span>) also may be vigilant, that we may learn that we are
all one Body, having only as much difference between one and another, as
between members and members, and may not cast the whole work upon the
Priests, but ourselves also care for the whole Church even as for a
common Body.”

<span id="ii.iii.v-p22"></span>It is remarkable that in Cyril’s account
of the Eucharistic rites in this Lecture there is not the slightest
reference to the words of Institution, though these hold so prominent a
place before the Invocation both in the Clementine Liturgy and in the
Liturgy of S. James.  But we cannot justly assume, from a mere omission
in so brief a summary, that the Commemoration of the Institution had no
place in the Liturgy then in use at Jerusalem.  It seems more probable
that Cyril did not think it necessary, after his repeated references to
the Institution in the preceding Lecture, to make further mention of a
custom so well known as the recitation of Christ’s own words in the
course of the Prayer preceding the Invocation.  On <span
id="page_xxxvi">p. xxxvi</span> <span
id="ii.iii.v-Page_xxxvi"></span>the previous day he had quoted S. Paul’s
account of the Institution, with the remark, “Since then He Himself has
declared and said of the Bread, This is My Body, who shall dare doubt
any longer?  And since He has Himself affirmed and said, This is My
Blood, who shall ever hesitate, saying that it is not His Blood <span
id="fr_227"></span>[228](#fn_227.md) ?”  The like efficacy he again
ascribes to “the Lord’s declaration” concerning both the Bread and the
Wine, that they are “the Body and Blood of Christ <span
id="fr_228"></span>[229](#fn_228.md) .”

<span id="ii.iii.v-p25"></span>In the Didaché, which gives the oldest
elements of an Eucharistic Service, there is neither the Commemoration
nor the Invocation, but only two short and simple forms of Thanksgiving
“for the Holy Vine of David,” and “for the broken Bread <span
id="fr_229"></span>[230](#fn_229.md) .”

<span id="ii.iii.v-p27"></span>Justin Martyr seems to imply that the
consecration is effected by the Commemoration of Christ’s own words in
the Institution:  “We have been taught,” he says, “that the food which
is blessed by the prayer of the word which comes from Him (<span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.v-p27.1"></span>τὴν δι᾽ εὐχῆς λόγου τοῦ
παρ αὐτοῦ εὐχαριστηθεῖσαν τροφήν</span>), and by which our blood and
flesh are by transmutation nourished, is the Flesh and Blood of that
Jesus who was made Flesh.”  He gives no separate Invocation of the Holy
Ghost, but this may have been supplied in the “praise and glory” or in
the “prayer and thanksgivings” sent up “to the Father of all through the
name of the Son and of the Holy Ghost <span
id="fr_230"></span>[231](#fn_230.md) .”

<span id="ii.iii.v-p29"></span>Irenæus is apparently the earliest writer
who represents the Invocation of the Holy Ghost as the immediate act of
consecration:  “We make an oblation to God of the bread and the cup of
blessing, giving Him thanks for that He has commanded the earth to bring
forth these fruits for our nourishment.  And then, having completed the
oblation, we call forth (<span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.v-p29.1"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.v-p29.2"></span>κκαλοῦμεν</span> ) the Holy Spirit, that He
may exhibit this sacrifice, both the bread the Body of Christ, and the
cup the Blood of Christ, in order that the partakers of these antitypes
may obtain the remission of sins and life eternal <span
id="fr_231"></span>[232](#fn_231.md) .”

<span id="ii.iii.v-p31"></span>Mr. Hammond writes that, “By the Oriental
Churches an Invocation of the Holy Spirit is considered necessary to
complete the consecration.  In the three Oriental Families of Liturgies
such an Invocation is invariably found shortly after the Words of
Institution <span id="fr_232"></span>[233](#fn_232.md) .”

<span id="ii.iii.v-p33"></span>It is in accordance with this statement
that, we find Cyril so frequently declaring that the elements which
before the Invocation are simple bread and wine, become after the
Invocation the Body and Blood of Christ <span
id="fr_233"></span>[234](#fn_233.md) .  In the first of the passages
referred to below he speaks of “the Holy Invocation of the Adorable
Trinity,” in the others of the Holy Spirit only.

<span id="ii.iii.v-p35"></span>Cyril next describes the Invocation as
“completing the Spiritual Sacrifice, the bloodless Service,” and then
gives a summary of the “Great Intercession” as made “over that Sacrifice
of the Propitiation.”  The Intercession, as represented by Cyril, is not
simply a prayer, but an offering of the Sacrifice <span
id="fr_234"></span>[235](#fn_234.md) , and this is in accordance with the
usual language of the Liturgies.”  We offer to Thee, O Lord, on behalf
also of Thy holy places, which Thou hast glorified by the Theophany of
Thy Christ, and by the visitation of Thine All-Holy Spirit:  especially
on behalf of glorious Sion, the Mother of all the Churches, and on
behalf of Thy Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church throughout the whole
world <span id="fr_235"></span>[236](#fn_235.md) .”  In the Liturgy of S.
Chrysostom, as now commonly used in the Orthodox Eastern Church, we find
the fuller phrase, “We offer unto Thee *this reasonable Service* on
behalf of the world, on behalf of the Holy Catholic and Apostolic
Church <span id="fr_236"></span>[237](#fn_236.md) .”

<span id="ii.iii.v-p39"></span>In some particulars Cyril’s summary
agrees most nearly with the Clementine Liturgy, as, for example, in the
prayer “for the King and those in authority, and for the whole army,
that they may be at peace with us <span
id="fr_237"></span>[238](#fn_237.md) .”  In others he follows the Liturgy
of S. James, <span id="page_xxxvii">p. xxxvii</span> <span
id="ii.iii.v-Page_xxxvii"></span>as in the intercession for “every
Christian soul afflicted and distressed, that stands in need of Thy pity
and succour <span id="fr_238"></span>[239](#fn_238.md) .”

<span id="ii.iii.v-p42"></span>Cyril next describes the commemoration of
departed Saints, and “of all who in past years have fallen asleep among
us,” that is, in the bosom of the Church, and states his belief “that it
will be a very great benefit to the souls, for whom the supplication is
put up while that holy and most awful Sacrifice is presented <span
id="fr_239"></span>[240](#fn_239.md) .”  He refers to objections against
this belief, and brings forward in defence of it a reason applicable
only to sinners:  “When we offer,” he says, “our supplications for those
who have fallen asleep, though they be sinners, we offer up Christ
sacrificed for our sins, propitiating our merciful God for them as well
as for ourselves <span id="fr_240"></span>[241](#fn_240.md) .”  His
language on this subject seems in fact to shew an advance in doctrine
beyond the earliest Liturgies.  In those of S. James and S. Basil we
find prayers that the offering may be acceptable as a propitiation “for
the rest of the souls that have fallen asleep aforetime,” and again,
“that we may find mercy and grace with all the Saints who have ever been
pleasing in Thy sight from generation to generation, forefathers,
fathers, Patriarchs, Prophets, Apostles, Martyrs, Confessors, Teachers,
holy men, and every righteous spirit made perfect in the faith of Thy
Christ.”

<span id="ii.iii.v-p45"></span>There is nothing here, nor in the
Clementine Liturgy, nor in that of S. Mark, corresponding to the purpose
which Cyril ascribes to the commemoration, “that at their prayers and
intercessions God would receive our petition.”  In the Anaphora of S.
Chrysostom contained in the later form of the Liturgy of Constantinople
we find, apparently for the first time, this prayer added to the
commemoration of all Saints, “at whose supplications look upon us, O
God.”

<span id="ii.iii.v-p46"></span>There was much controversy on the subject
of prayers for the dead in Cyril’s time, and the objections which he
notices were brought into prominence by Ærius, and rebuked by
Epiphanius <span id="fr_241"></span>[242](#fn_241.md) .

<span id="ii.iii.v-p48"></span>From the commemoration of the departed
Cyril passes at once to the Lord’s Prayer <span
id="fr_242"></span>[243](#fn_242.md) , omitting the Preface which is found
in the Liturgies of S. James and S. Mark.  In the Clementine Liturgy,
contrary to general use, the Lord’s Prayer is not said at all.  Cyril
adds an exposition of each petition, and gives an unusual explanation of
<span class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.v-p49.1"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.v-p49.2"></span>πιούσιος</span>, for
which see the footnote:  he also explains <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.v-p49.3"></span>τοῦ πονηροῦ</span> as referring to “the
wicked one,” following in this the Embolismus of S. James, “deliver us
from the wicked one and from his works.”

<span id="ii.iii.v-p50"></span>“After this the Bishop says, Holy things
for holy men <span id="fr_243"></span>[244](#fn_243.md) .”  Chrysostom
explains this as being both an invitation to the Faithful in general to
communicate, and a warning to the unholy to withdraw.  “The Bishop, with
loud voice and awe-inspiring cry, raising high his arm like a herald,
and standing on high in sight of all, above that awful silence cries
aloud, inviting some and repelling others, and doing this not with his
hand, but with his tongue more clearly than with the hand..…For when he
says, Holy things for the holy, he means this:  Whosoever is not holy,
let him not draw near <span id="fr_244"></span>[245](#fn_244.md) .”

<span id="ii.iii.v-p53"></span>In regard to the doctrinal significance
of the formula, Dr. Waterland’s remarks should be consulted <span
id="fr_245"></span>[246](#fn_245.md) .

<span id="ii.iii.v-p55"></span>The response of the people to the “Sancta
Sanctis” is given by Cyril <span id="fr_246"></span>[247](#fn_246.md) in
accordance with the Liturgy of S. James and the Clementine:  “One is
Holy, One is the Lord, Jesus Christ:”  but he does not mention the
“Gloria in excelsis” nor the “Hosanna,” both of which follow here in the
Clementine.

<span id="ii.iii.v-p57"></span>“After this,” says Cyril, “ye hear the
chanter inviting you with a sacred melody to the Communion of the Holy
Mysteries, and saying, *O taste and see that the Lord is good* <span
id="fr_247"></span>[248](#fn_247.md) .  This <span id="page_xxxviii">p.
xxxviii</span> <span id="ii.iii.v-Page_xxxviii"></span>agrees with the
Clementine rubric:  “Let the 33rd Psalm be sung while all the rest are
partaking.”  In the Liturgy of S. James, while the Bishop is breaking
the Bread and dipping in the Wine, the “Agnus Dei” and several Psalms
were sung:  but of these there is no mention in the Clementine Liturgy
or in Cyril.

<span id="ii.iii.v-p59"></span>On Cyril’s directions for receiving the
Bread and the Cup with due reverence, see the footnotes on the
passages <span id="fr_248"></span>[249](#fn_248.md) .

<span id="ii.iii.v-p61"></span>His final injunction to remain for the
prayer and thanksgiving is taken from that in the Clementine Liturgy: 
“Having partaken of the precious Body and the precious Blood of Christ,
let us give thanks to Him who hath counted us worthy to partake of His
holy Mysteries.”  The thanksgiving, benediction, concluding prayers, and
dismissal, vary much in the different Liturgies.
