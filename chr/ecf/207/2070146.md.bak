George, a deacon of Nazianzus, to the good offices of the Archbishop and
the Count of the Domestics, or Master of the Imperial Household, on
account of his private troubles and anxieties.)

<span id="iv.iv.vi.iii-p3"></span>People in general make a very good
guess at your disposition—or rather, they do not conjecture, but they do
not refuse to believe me when I pride myself on the fact that you deem
me worthy of no small respect and honour.  One of these people is my
very precious son George, who having fallen into many losses, and being
very much overwhelmed by his troubles, can find only one harbour of
safety, namely, to be introduced to you by us, and to obtain some favour
at the hands of the Most Illustrious the Count of the Domestics.  Grant
them this favour, either to him and his need, or else, if you prefer it,
to me, to whom I know you have resolved to grant all favours; and facts
also persuade me that this is true of you.
