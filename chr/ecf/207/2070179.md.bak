id="iv.iv.ix.ix-p1.1"></span>Ep. CXLII.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.ix.ix-p2"></span>Though my desire to meet you is warm,
and the need of your petitioners is great, yet my illness is
invincible.  Therefore I am bold to commit my intercession to writing. 
Have respect to our gray hair, which you have already often reverenced
by good actions.  Have respect also to my infirmity, to which my labours
for God have in part contributed, if I may swagger a little.  For this
cause spare the citizens who look to me because I use some freedom of
speech with you.  And spare also the others who are under my care.  For
public affairs will suffer no damage through mercy, since you can do
more by fear than others by punishment.  May you, as your reward for
this, obtain such a Judge as you shew yourself to your petitioners and
to me their intercessor.
