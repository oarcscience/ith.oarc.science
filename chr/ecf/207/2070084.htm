<p class="c42"><a name="iv.iii.v-p1"></A> <span class="c1"><a name="iv.iii.v-p1.1"></A>Ep. VI.</span></p>  
<p class="c23"><a name="iv.iii.v-p2"></A>(Written about the same time, in a more serious vein.)</p>  
<p class="c23"><a name="iv.iii.v-p3"></A>What I wrote before about our stay in Pontus was in joke, not in earnest; what I write now is very much in earnest.&#160; O that one would place me as in the month of those former days,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4732"></A><A HREF="#fn_4732"><FONT SIZE="1">4733</FONT></A>
 in which I luxuriated with you in hard living; since voluntary pain is more valuable than involuntary delight.&#160; O that one would give me back those psalmodies <A NAME="page_448"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 448</FONT></A> <a name="iv.iii.v-Page_448"></A>and vigils and those sojournings with God in prayer, and that immaterial, so to speak, and unbodied life.&#160; O for the intimacy and one-souledness of the brethren who were by you divinized and exalted:&#160; O for the contest and incitement of virtue which we secured by written Rules and Canons; O for the loving labour in the Divine Oracles, and the light we found in them by the guidance of the Holy Ghost.&#160; Or, if I may speak of lesser and slighter matters, O for the daily courses and experiences; O for the gatherings of wood, and the cutting of stone; O for the golden plane-tree, more precious than that of Xerxes, under which sat, not a King enfeebled by luxury, but a Monk worn out by hard life, which I planted and Apollos (I mean your honourable self) watered;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4733"></A><A HREF="#fn_4733"><FONT SIZE="1">4734</FONT></A>
 but God gave the increase to our honour, that a memorial might remain among you of my diligence, as in the Ark we read and believe, did Aaron&#146;s rod that budded.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4734"></A><A HREF="#fn_4734"><FONT SIZE="1">4735</FONT></A>
&#160; To long for all this is very easy, but it is not easy to attain it.&#160; But do you come to me, and conspire with me in virtue, and co-operate with me, and aid me by your prayers to keep the profit which we used to get together, that I may not perish by little and little, like a shadow as the day draws to its close.&#160; I would rather breathe you than the air, and only live while I am with you, either actually in your presence, or virtually by your likeness in your absence.</p>
