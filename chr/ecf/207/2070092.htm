<p class="c23"><a name="iv.iii.xiii-p2"></A>(The comprovincial Bishops had notified the elder Gregory of their Synod, but without mentioning its date or purpose or inviting him to take part in it&#8212;probably because they knew how strongly he would support the election of Basil, to which they were unfavourable.&#160; S. Gregory therefore wrote the following letter in his father&#146;s name.)</p>  
<p class="c23"><a name="iv.iii.xiii-p3"></A>How sweet and kind you are, and how full of love.&#160; You have invited me to the Metropolis, because, as I imagine, you are going to take some counsel about a Bishop.&#160; So much I learn from you, though you have not told me either that I am to be present, or why, or when, but have merely announced to me suddenly that you were setting out, as though resolved not to respect me, and as not desirous that I should share your counsels, but rather putting a hindrance in the way of my coming, that you may not meet me even against my will. &#160;This is your way of action, and I will put up with the insult, but I will set before you my view and how I feel.&#160; Various people will put forward various candidates, each according to his own inclinations and interests, as is usually the case at such times.&#160; But I cannot prefer anyone, for my conscience would not allow it, to my dear son and fellow priest Basil.&#160; For whom of all my acquaintance do I find more approved in his life, or more powerful in his word, or more furnished altogether with the beauty of virtue?&#160; But if you allege weak health against him, I reply that we are choosing not an athlete but a teacher.&#160; And at the same time is seen in this case the power of Him that strengthens and supports the weak, if such they be.&#160; If you accept this vote I will come and take part, either in spirit or in body.&#160; But if you are marching to a foregone conclusion, and faction is to overrule justice, I shall rejoice to have been overlooked.&#160; The work must be yours; but pray for me.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4737"></A><A HREF="#fn_4737"><FONT SIZE="1">4738</FONT></A>

<p class="endnote"><a name="iv.iii.xiii-p4"></A> There is here a various reading (the difference being merely the result of itacism) which seems to give a better sense; &#8220;Ours is to pray for you.&#8221;</p>
