id="ii.iii.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter X.—The Creed of Jerusalem:  Doctrine
of the Holy Trinity.</span>

<span id="ii.iii.x-p2"></span>§ 1.  *The Creed*.  The ancient Creed
which was used by the Church of Jerusalem in the middle of the fourth
Century, and which Cyril expounded in his Catechetical Lectures, was
recited by him to the Catechumens at the end of the fifth Lecture, to be
committed to memory, but not to be written out on paper (§ 12). 
Accordingly it is not found in any of the MSS., but instead of it the
Nicene Creed with the Anathema is there inserted in Codd. Roe, Casaub. 
This could only have been added after Cyril’s time, when the motives for
secrecy had ceased.

<span id="ii.iii.x-p3"></span>The Creed which Cyril really taught and
expounded may be gathered from various passages in the Lectures
themselves, and especially from the Titles prefixed to them.

<span id="ii.iii.x-p4"></span>With the Creed of Jerusalem thus
ascertained, it will be instructive to compare the Nicene formula, and
for this purpose we print them in parallel columns.

<span id="ii.iii.x-p70"></span>§ 2.  *Doctrine of the Holy Trinity*. 
“The doctrinal position of S. Cyril is admirably described, and his
orthodoxy vindicated by Cardinal Newman in the following passage of his
Preface to the Lectures in the Library of the Fathers.  “There is
something very remarkable and even startling to the reader of S. Cyril,
to find in a divine of his school such a perfect agreement, for instance
as regards the doctrine of the Trinity, with those Fathers who in his
age were more famous as champions of it.  Here is a writer, separated by
whatsoever cause from what, speaking historically, may be called the
Athanasian School, suspicious of its adherents, and suspected by them;
yet he, when he comes to explain himself, expresses precisely the same
doctrine as that of Athanasius or Gregory, while he merely abstains from
the particular theological term in which the latter Fathers agreeably to
the Nicene Council conveyed it.  Can we have a clearer proof that the
difference of opinion between them was not one of ecclesiastical and
traditionary doctrine, but of practical judgment? that the Fathers at
Nicæa wisely considered that, under the circumstances, the word in
question was the only symbol which would secure the Church against the
insidious heresy which was assailing it, while S. Cyril, with Eusebius
of Cæsarea, Meletius and others shrank from it, at least for a while,
<span id="page_lvi">p. lvi</span> <span id="ii.iii.x-Page_lvi"></span>as
if an addition to the Creed, or a word already taken into the service of
an opposite heresy, and likely to introduce into the Church heretical
notions?  Their judgment, which was erroneous, was their own; their
faith was not theirs only, but shared with them by the whole Christian
world <span id="fr_344"></span>[345](#fn_344.md) .”

<span id="ii.iii.x-p72"></span>In regard to the doctrine of the Trinity
in general the two great heresies which distracted the Church in S.
Cyril’s day were Sabellianism and Arianism, the one “confounding the
Persons,” the other “dividing the substance” of the indivisible Unity of
the Godhead.  Both these opposite errors Cyril condemns with equal
energy:  “Do thou neither separate the Son from the Father, nor by
making a confusion believe in a Son-Fatherhood <span
id="fr_345"></span>[346](#fn_345.md) .”  Again he says:  “Our hope is in
Father, and Son, and Holy Ghost.  We preach not three Gods:  let the
Marcionites be silenced; but with the Holy Ghost through One Son we
preach One God.  The Faith is indivisible; the worship inseparable.  We
neither separate the Holy Trinity, like some (that is the Arians); nor
do we, as Sabellius, work confusion <span
id="fr_346"></span>[347](#fn_346.md) .”  “He says not, I am the Father, but
*the Father is in Me, and I am in the Father*.  And again He said not,
*I and the Father* am *one*, but, *I and the Father are One*, that we
should neither separate them, nor make a confusion of Son-Father <span
id="fr_347"></span>[348](#fn_347.md) .”

<span id="ii.iii.x-p76"></span>In the sequel of this last passage Cyril
proceeds to argue that this unity of the Father and the Son lies in
their Nature, “since God begat God,” in their Kingdom <span
id="fr_348"></span>[349](#fn_348.md) , in their Will <span
id="fr_349"></span>[350](#fn_349.md) , and in their joint Creation <span
id="fr_350"></span>[351](#fn_350.md) , thus at each step rejecting some
prominent heretical tenet.

<span id="ii.iii.x-p80"></span>The question, however, of Cyril’s
orthodoxy depends especially upon his supposed opposition to the Creed
of Nicæa, of which no evidence is alleged except his attendance at the
Council of Seleucia, and the absence from his Lectures of the word <span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.x-p80.1"></span>ὁ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.x-p80.2"></span>μοούσιον</span>.

<span id="ii.iii.x-p81"></span>The purpose of Cyril’s attendance at
Seleucia was to appeal against his deposition by Acacius, and there is
apparently no evidence of his having taken part in the doctrinal
discussions, or signed the Creed of Antioch <span
id="fr_351"></span>[352](#fn_351.md) .  What is certain is that Cyril’s
bitterest enemies who refused to sit with him in the Council were
Acacius and his Arian allies, who expressly rejected both <span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.x-p82.1"></span>ὁ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.x-p82.2"></span>μοούσιος</span> and <span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.x-p82.3"></span>ὁ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.x-p82.4"></span>μοιούσιος</span> and
“altogether denied the Nicene formula and censured the Council, while
the others, who were the majority, accepted the whole proceedings of the
Council, except that they complained of the word ‘Co-essential,’ as
obscure, and so open to suspicion <span
id="fr_352"></span>[353](#fn_352.md) .”  It thus appears that Cyril’s
friends at Seleucia were partly those who approved the word “
Co-essential,” and partly those of whom Athanasius speaks as “brothers,
who mean what we mean, and dispute only about the word <span
id="fr_353"></span>[354](#fn_353.md) .”  It needed in fact the profound
insight of an Athanasius to foresee that in the end that word must
triumph over all opposition, and be accepted by the Universal Church as
the one true safeguard of the Christian Faith.  Meanwhile it was the
standard round which debate, and strife, and hatred, and persecution,
were to rage for fifty years with unexampled fury.

<span id="ii.iii.x-p85"></span>Was Cyril to be blamed, ought he not
rather to be commended, for not introducing such a war-cry into the
exposition of an ancient Creed, in which it had no place, the Creed of
his own Church, the Mother of all the Churches, whose Faith he as a
youthful Presbyter was commissioned to teach to the young Candidates for
Baptism?

<span id="ii.iii.x-p86"></span>But if we compare his doctrine with that
of the Nicene formula, we shall find that, as Dr. Newman says, “His own
writings are most exactly orthodox, though he does not in the
Catechetical Lectures use the word <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p86.1"></span>ὁ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p86.2"></span>μοούσιον</span> <span
id="fr_354"></span>[355](#fn_354.md) .”

<span id="ii.iii.x-p88"></span>The first point to be noticed in the
comparison is the use of the title “Son of God.”  <span
id="page_lvii">p. lvii</span> <span id="ii.iii.x-Page_lvii"></span>For
this Eusebius in his Creed had substituted “Word of God.”  Athanasius
explains the significance of the change:  “Uniting the two titles,
Scripture speaks of ‘Son’ in order to herald the natural and true
offspring of His essence (<span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p88.1"></span>οὐσίας</span>); and on the other hand that
none may think of the offspring as human, in again indicating His
essence it calls Him Word, and Wisdom, and Radiance, for from this we
infer that the generation was impassible (<span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p88.2"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p88.3"></span>παθές</span>), and eternal, and becoming to
God <span id="fr_355"></span>[356](#fn_355.md) .”

<span id="ii.iii.x-p90"></span>Cyril is here in full accord with
Athanasius:  in his Creed he found “Son of God,” and in his exposition
he states that the Father is “by nature and in truth Father of One only,
the Only-begotten Son <span id="fr_356"></span>[357](#fn_356.md) :”  “One
they are because of the dignity pertaining to the Godhead, since God
begat God <span id="fr_357"></span>[358](#fn_357.md) :”  “The Son then is
<span class="sc"><span id="ii.iii.x-p92.1"></span>Very God</span>,
having the Father in Himself, not changed into the Father <span
id="fr_358"></span>[359](#fn_358.md) .”  When he says that the Son is in
all things like (<span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p93.1"></span>ὅ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p93.2"></span>μοιος ἐν πᾶσιν</span>) to Him who begat Him;
begotten Life of Life, and Light of Light, Power of Power, God of God,
and the characteristics of the Godhead are unchangeable (<span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.x-p93.3"></span>ἀ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.x-p93.4"></span>παράλλακτοι</span> ) in
the Son <span id="fr_359"></span>[360](#fn_359.md) ,” he is using in all
good faith the very words of the orthodox Bishops at Nicæa, “<span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.x-p94.1"></span>ὅ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.x-p94.2"></span>μοιόν τε καὶ ἀπαράλλακτον
αὐτὸν κατὰ πὰντα τῷ Πατρί</span> <span id="fr_360"></span>[361](#fn_360.md)
.”

<span id="ii.iii.x-p96"></span>The further significance which Athanasius
ascribes to the title “Logos,” is also expressed fully and repeatedly by
Cyril:  “Whenever thou hearest of God begetting, sink not down in
thought to bodily things, nor think of a corruptible generation, lest
thou be guilty of impiety <span id="fr_361"></span>[362](#fn_361.md) .”

<span id="ii.iii.x-p98"></span>The “passionless generation,” to which so
much importance was attached at Nicæa and by Athanasius, is also
asserted by Cyril when he says that God “became a Father not by passion
(<span class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.x-p98.1"></span>οὐ πάθει Πατὴρ
γενόμενος</span>) <span id="fr_362"></span>[363](#fn_362.md) .”  The
eternal generation is most emphatically declared again and again:  the
Son, he says, “began not His existence in time, but was before all ages
eternally and incomprehensibly begotten of the Father; the Wisdom, and
the Power of God, and His Righteousness personally subsisting <span
id="fr_363"></span>[364](#fn_363.md) :”  “Throughout His being (<span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.x-p100.1"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.x-p100.2"></span>ξ οὗπερ ἦν</span>), a
being by eternal generation, He holds His royal dignity, and shares His
Father’s seat <span id="fr_364"></span>[365](#fn_364.md) .”  Believe that
of One God there is One Only-begotten Son, who is before all ages God
the Word; not the uttered word diffused into the air, nor to be likened
to impersonal words; but the Word, the Son, Maker of all who partake of
reason, the Word who heareth the father, and Himself speaketh <span
id="fr_365"></span>[366](#fn_365.md) .”

<span id="ii.iii.x-p103"></span>The importance of such language is
better understood when we remember that Marcellus, “another head of the
dragon lately sprung up in Galatia <span
id="fr_366"></span>[367](#fn_366.md) ,” entirely rejected the word
“Begotten,” as implying a beginning, and “contradicting the eternity of
the Logos, so distinctly proclaimed by S. John.”  An eternal generation,
as stated by Athanasius and others, was to him unimaginable.  The Logos
in His pre-existence was unbegotten, and could not be called Son, but
only the Logos invested with human nature was Son of God and
begotten <span id="fr_367"></span>[368](#fn_367.md) .”  These heretical
opinions of Marcellus had been condemned in several Councils within a
few years preceding Cyril’s Lectures.

<span id="ii.iii.x-p106"></span>The next supposed proof of Cyril’s
opposition to the Nicene doctrine is that he has not adopted in his
Lectures the phrases “of the essence (<span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p106.1"></span>οὐσίας</span>) of the Father,” and “of one
essence (<span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p106.2"></span>ὁ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p106.3"></span>μοούσιον</span>) with the Father.”  This
omission is the chief ground of the reproaches cast upon the memory of
Cyril by the writers of Ecclesiastical History; for this he was
described by Jerome as an Arian, and by Rufinus as a waverer, while his
formal acceptance of the terms used at Nicæa is called by Socrates and
Sozomen an act of repentance.  By others he was denounced as <span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.x-p106.4"></span>᾽</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.x-p106.5"></span>Α</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.x-p106.6"></span>ρειανόφρων</span>
because he had addressed his letter to Constantius as “the most
religious king,” and never used the word <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p106.7"></span>ὁ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p106.8"></span>μοούσιον</span> in his Lectures.

<span id="ii.iii.x-p107"></span><span id="page_lviii">p. lviii</span>
<span id="ii.iii.x-Page_lviii"></span>We shall be better able to
estimate the justice of these reproaches, if we consider first the
history of these words <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p107.1"></span>οὐσία</span> and <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p107.2"></span>ὁ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p107.3"></span>μοούσιος</span>, and the reasons which Cyril
may have had for not employing them in the instruction of youthful
Candidates for Baptism.

<span id="ii.iii.x-p108"></span>It is strange to find that seven hundred
years before the great controversy at Nicæa on the introduction of the
word <span class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.x-p108.1"></span>Οὐσία</span>
into the Creed, it had been the war-cry of almost as fierce a conflict
between rival schools of philosophy.

<span id="ii.iii.x-p109"></span>“There appears,” says Plato in the
person of the Eleatic stranger, “to be a sort of war of the giants going
on between them because of the dispute concerning <span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.x-p109.1"></span>οὐσία</span>.  Some of
them are dragging all things down from heaven and from the invisible to
earth, grasping rocks and oaks in their hands; for of all such things
they lay hold, in obstinately maintaining that what can be touched and
handled alone has being (<span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p109.2"></span>εἶναι</span>), because they define ‘being’
and ‘body’ as one; and if any one else says that what is not a body has
being, they altogether despise him, and will hear of nothing but
body….Therefore their opponents cautiously defend themselves from above
out of some invisible world, mightily contending that certain
intelligible and incorporeal ideas are the true essence (<span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.x-p109.3"></span>οὐσίαν</span>) <span
id="fr_368"></span>[369](#fn_368.md) .”

<span id="ii.iii.x-p111"></span>It is apparently to this passage of
Plato that Aristotle refers in describing the ambiguity of the word
<span class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.x-p111.1"></span>οὐσία</span> <span
id="fr_369"></span>[370](#fn_369.md) :  “Now <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p112.1"></span>Οὐσία</span> seems to belong most manifestly
to bodies:  wherefore animals and plants and their parts we say are
<span class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.x-p112.2"></span>οὐσίαι</span>,
also natural bodies as fire and water and earth and all such things, and
all either parts of these, or products either of parts or the whole, as
the heaven and its parts, stars, moon, and sun.  But whether these are
the only <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p112.3"></span>οὐσίαι</span> or there are others also, or
none of these but others of a different kind, is a matter for inquiry. 
Some think that the boundaries of bodies, as a surface, and a line and a
point and a unit (<span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p112.4"></span>μονάς</span>), are <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p112.5"></span>οὐσίαι</span>, even more so than body and
solid.  Further, one class of persons thinks that besides things
sensible there is no <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p112.6"></span>οὐσία</span>, and another that there are
many things, and these more enduring (<span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p112.7"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p112.8"></span>ΐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p112.9"></span>δια</span>), as Plato thinks that the ideas
(<span class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.x-p112.10"></span>εἴδη</span>) and
the mathematical elements are two kinds of <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p112.11"></span>οὐσία</span>, and that the <span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.x-p112.12"></span>οὐσία</span> of
sensible bodies is a third.”

<span id="ii.iii.x-p113"></span>In proceeding to define the term,
Aristotle says that <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p113.1"></span>οὐσία</span> is used in four senses if not
more:  the essential nature (<span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p113.2"></span>τὸ τί ἦν εἶναι</span>), the universal (<span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.x-p113.3"></span>τὸ καθόλον</span>) the
genus, and a fourth the subject (<span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p113.4"></span>τὸ ὑποκείμενον</span>).  Under, this fourth
sense he proceeds to discuss the application of the term <span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.x-p113.5"></span>οὐσια</span> to the
matter, the form, and the resulting whole.  Without going further we may
see that the use of the word in philosophy was full of difficulty and
ambiguity.

<span id="ii.iii.x-p114"></span>The ambiguity is thus expressed by Mr.
Robertson <span id="fr_370"></span>[371](#fn_370.md) :  “We may look at a
concrete term as denoting either this or that individual simply (<span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.x-p115.1"></span>τόδε τι</span>), or as
expressing its nature, and so as *common* to more individuals than one. 
Now properly (<span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p115.2"></span>πρώτως</span>) <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p115.3"></span>οὐσία</span> is only appropriate to the
former purpose.  But it may be employed in a secondary sense to
designate the latter, in this sense species and genera are <span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.x-p115.4"></span>δεύτεραι οὐσίαι</span>,
the wider class being less truly <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p115.5"></span>οὐσίαι</span> than the former.”  Perhaps the
earliest use of <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p115.6"></span>οὐσία</span> in Christian writings is in
Justin M. <span id="fr_371"></span>[372](#fn_371.md) , where he describes
the Logos as “having been begotten from the Father, by His power and
will, but not by abscission (<span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p116.1"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p116.2"></span>ποτομήν</span>), as if the <span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.x-p116.3"></span>οὐσία</span> of the
Father were divided, as all other things when divided and cut are no
longer the same as before.”  His example was fire, from which other
fires are kindled, while it remains undiminished and unchanged. 
According to Dr. Newman <span id="fr_372"></span>[373](#fn_372.md) , <span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.x-p117.1"></span>οὐσία</span> here means
“substance, or being.”

<span id="ii.iii.x-p118"></span>In Clement of Alexandria <span
id="fr_373"></span>[374](#fn_373.md) , <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p119.1"></span>οὐσία</span> means a “nature” common to
many, for he speaks of the Gnostic Demiurge as creating an irrational
soul <span class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.x-p119.2"></span>ὁ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.x-p119.3"></span>μοούσιον</span> with the
soul of the beasts;” and again as implanting in man “something
co-essential (<span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p119.4"></span>ὁ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p119.5"></span>μοούσιον</span>) with himself, inasmuch as
he is invisible and incorporeal; his essence (<span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p119.6"></span>οὐσίαν</span>) he called “the breath of
life,” but the thing formed (<span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p119.7"></span>μορφωθέν</span>) became “a living soul,”
which in the prophetic Scriptures he <span id="page_lix">p. lix</span>
<span id="ii.iii.x-Page_lix"></span>confesses himself to be.  Again in
§42 of the same Fragment, according to the Valentinians, “the body of
Jesus is co-essential (<span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p119.8"></span>ὁ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p119.9"></span>μοούσιον</span>) with the Church.”

<span id="ii.iii.x-p120"></span>So Hippolytus <span
id="fr_374"></span>[375](#fn_374.md) speaks of the Son Incarnate as being
“at one and the same time Infinite God and finite Man, having the nature
(<span class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.x-p121.1"></span>οὐσίαν</span>) of
each in perfection:”  and again, “There has been effected a certain
inexpressible and irrefragable union of the two (the Godhead and the
Manhood) into one subsistence (<span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p121.2"></span>ὑ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p121.3"></span>πόστασιν</span>).”

<span id="ii.iii.x-p122"></span>In Origen we find the two words <span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.x-p122.1"></span>οὐσία</span> (essence,
or substance) and <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p122.2"></span>ὑ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p122.3"></span>πόστασις</span> (individual subsistence)
accurately distinguished.  Quoting the description of Wisdom, as being
the breath (<span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p122.4"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p122.5"></span>τμίς</span>) of the power of God, and pure
effluence (<span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p122.6"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p122.7"></span>πόρροια</span>) from the glory of the
Almighty, and radiance (<span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p122.8"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p122.9"></span>παύγασμα</span>) of the Eternal Light <span
id="fr_375"></span>[376](#fn_375.md) ,” he says that “Wisdom proceeding
from Him is generated of the very substance of God,” and adds that
“these comparisons most manifestly shew that there is community of
substance between Father and Son.  For an effluence appears to be <span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.x-p123.2"></span>ὁ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.x-p123.3"></span>μοούσιος</span>, that
is, of one substance with that body from which it is an effluence or
vapour.”

<span id="ii.iii.x-p124"></span>On the other hand he writes, “We worship
the Father of the Truth, and the Son who is the Truth, being in
subsistence (<span class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.x-p124.1"></span>τῇ
ὑποστάσει</span>) two <span id="fr_376"></span>[377](#fn_376.md) .”  On
this passage Bishop Bull remarks:  “The words <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p125.1"></span>ὑ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p125.2"></span>πόστασις</span> and <span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.x-p125.3"></span>οὐσία</span> in ancient
times were variously used, at least by the Christians.  That is to say,
sometimes <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p125.4"></span>ὑ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p125.5"></span>πόστασις</span> was taken by them for what
we call <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p125.6"></span>οὐσία</span>, and *vice versa*, <span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.x-p125.7"></span>οὐσία</span> for what we
call <span class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.x-p125.8"></span>ὑ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.x-p125.9"></span>πόστασις</span>: 
sometimes the ancients even before the Council of Nicæa used <span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.x-p125.10"></span>ὑ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.x-p125.11"></span>πόστασις</span> for
what we now call ‘person’ or ‘subsistence <span
id="fr_377"></span>[378](#fn_377.md) ’.”  This Bishop Bull presently
explains again as “an individual thing subsisting by itself, which in
rational beings is the same as *person*.”

<span id="ii.iii.x-p127"></span>For examples of these interchanges of
meaning, we may notice that the Synod of Antioch (<span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p127.1"></span>a.d.</span> 269), in the Epistle addressed
to Paul of Samosata before his deposition, speaking of the unity of
Christ’s *Person*, says that “He is one and the same in His <span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.x-p127.2"></span>οὐσίᾳ</span> <span
id="fr_378"></span>[379](#fn_378.md) .”  On this passage Routh remarks that
“The words <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p128.1"></span>οὐσία</span> and <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p128.2"></span>φύσις</span> are sometimes employed by the
ancients for a personal subsistence (*persona subsistente*), as is
plainly testified by Photius.”

<span id="ii.iii.x-p129"></span>In the earlier part <span
id="fr_379"></span>[380](#fn_379.md) of the same Epistle the Son is
described as “being before all ages, not in foreknowledge, but in
essence and subsistence (<span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p130.1"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p130.2"></span>ν οὐσίᾳ καὶ ὑποστάσει</span>).”

<span id="ii.iii.x-p131"></span>The confusion arising from the
uncertainty in the use of these two words is well illustrated in the
account which Athanasius <span id="fr_380"></span>[381](#fn_380.md) himself
gives of this same Synod of Antioch:  “They who deposed the Samosatene,
took Co-essential (<span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p132.1"></span>ὁ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p132.2"></span>μοούσιος</span>) in a bodily sense, because
Paul had attempted sophistry and said, ‘Unless Christ has of man become
God, it follows that He is Co-essential with the Father; and if so, of
necessity there are three essences (<span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p132.3"></span>οὐσίαι</span>), one the previous essence,
and the other two from it;’ and therefore guarding against this they
said with good reason, that Christ was not Co-essential (<span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.x-p132.4"></span>ὁ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.x-p132.5"></span>μοούσιον</span>).” 
Athanasius then explains on what grounds the Bishops at Nicæa
“reasonably asserted on their part, that the Son was Co-essential.” 
Athanasius himself states that, in giving this explanation of the
rejection of <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p132.6"></span>οὐσιον</span> by the Bishops who condemned
the Samosatene, he had not their Epistle before him <span
id="fr_381"></span>[382](#fn_381.md) ; and his statement, that Paul used
the term not to express his own view, but to refute that of the Bishops,
is thought to be opposed to what Hilary says <span
id="fr_382"></span>[383](#fn_382.md) , “Male <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p134.1"></span>ὁ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p134.2"></span>μοούσιον</span> Samosatenus confessus est: 
sed numquid melius Ariani negaverunt?”

<span id="ii.iii.x-p135"></span>That the statement of Athanasius himself
is not free from difficulty is clear from the way in which so great a
Theologian as Bishop Hefele endeavours to explain it:  “Athanasius says
that Paul argued in this way:  If Christ is <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p135.1"></span>῾</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p135.2"></span>Ο</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p135.3"></span>μοούσιος</span> with the Father, then three
subsistences (<span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p135.4"></span>οὐσίαι</span>) must be admitted—one first
substance (the Father), and two more recent (the Son and <span
id="page_lx">p. lx</span> <span id="ii.iii.x-Page_lx"></span>the
Spirit); that is to say, that the Divine Substance is separated into
three parts <span id="fr_383"></span>[384](#fn_383.md) .”  The logical
subtlety of Paul was better understood by Basil the Great <span
id="fr_384"></span>[385](#fn_384.md) :  “For in truth they who met together
about Paul of Samosata found fault with the phrase, as not being
distinct; for they said that the word <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p137.1"></span>ὁ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p137.2"></span>μοούσιος</span> gave the idea of an <span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.x-p137.3"></span>οὐσία</span> and of
those derived from it, so that the title <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p137.4"></span>ὁ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p137.5"></span>μοούσιον</span> assigned the <span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.x-p137.6"></span>οὐσία</span> separately
to the subjects to which it was distributed:  and this notion has some
reason in the case of copper and the coins made from it; but in the case
of God the Father, and God the Son, there is no substance conceived to
be antecedent and superior to both:  for to say and to think this
surpasses all bounds of impiety.”

<span id="ii.iii.x-p138"></span>The confusion arising from the
uncertainty in the use of these words had been the cause of strife
throughout the Christian Church for more than twenty years before the
date of Cyril’s Lectures; and though it was declared at the Council of
Alexandria (362) to be but a controversy about words <span
id="fr_385"></span>[386](#fn_385.md) , it had long been and long afterwards
continued to be a fruitful cause of dissension between men who, when
forced to explain their meaning, were found to be in substantial
agreement.  That Cyril abstained from introducing into his elementary
teaching terms so provocative of dangerous controversy, is a reason for
commendation, not for censure.  But if it is alleged that he denied or
doubted or failed to assert the essential Godhead of the Son, the
suspicion is unfounded and easily refuted.  To the many passages already
quoted concerning the eternal generation of the Son, it will be enough
to add one single sentence which ought to dispel all doubt of his
orthodoxy.  “The Only-begotten Son, together with the Holy Ghost, is
partaker of the Godhead of the Father (<span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p139.1"></span>τῆς θεότητος τῆς Πατρικῆς
κοινωνός</span>).”  The word chosen by Cyril to express the Divine
Essence (<span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p139.2"></span>θεότης</span>) common to the three Persons
of the Godhead is at least as appropriate as <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p139.3"></span>οὐσία</span>.

<span id="ii.iii.x-p140"></span>If we now look at the particular errors
mentioned in the Anathema of the Nicene Council, we shall find that
every one of them is earnestly condemned by Cyril.

<span id="ii.iii.x-p141"></span>“*Once He was not* (<span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.x-p141.1"></span>῏</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.x-p141.2"></span>Ην ποτε ὅτε οὐκ
ἦν</span>).  This famous Arian formula is expressly rejected in Cat. xi.
§ 17:  “Neither let us say, There was a time when the Son was not.”  The
eternity of the Son is asserted again and again, in reference, for
instance, to His generation <span id="fr_386"></span>[387](#fn_386.md) ,
His Priesthood <span id="fr_387"></span>[388](#fn_387.md) , and His
throne <span id="fr_388"></span>[389](#fn_388.md) .

<span id="ii.iii.x-p145"></span>“*Before His generation He was not*”
(<span class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.x-p145.1"></span>πρὶν γεννηθῆναι
οὐκ ἦν</span>).  Compare with this Cyril’s repeated assertions that “the
Son is eternally begotten, by an inscrutable and incomprehensible
generation <span id="fr_389"></span>[390](#fn_389.md) ,” “the Son of God
<span class="sc"><span id="ii.iii.x-p146.1"></span>before all
ages</span>, without beginning <span id="fr_390"></span>[391](#fn_390.md)
,” that “time intervenes not in the generation of the Son from the
Father <span id="fr_391"></span>[392](#fn_391.md) .”

<span id="ii.iii.x-p149"></span>“*He came to be from nothing*” (<span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.x-p149.1"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.x-p149.2"></span>ξ οὐκ ὄντων
ἐγένετο</span>).  Cyril’s language is emphatic:  “As I have often said,
He did not bring forth the Son from non-existence (<span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.x-p149.3"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.x-p149.4"></span>κ τοῦ μὴ ὄντος</span>)
into being, nor take the non-existent into Sonship <span
id="fr_392"></span>[393](#fn_392.md) .”

<span id="ii.iii.x-p151"></span>“*That He is of other subsistence or
essence*” (<span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p151.1"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p151.2"></span>ξ ἑτέρας ὑποστάσεως ἢ οὐσίας</span>).  It is
certain that Cyril has given no countenance to the error or errors
condemned in this clause, but is in entire agreement with the Council.

<span id="ii.iii.x-p152"></span>On the question whether <span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.x-p152.1"></span>ὺ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.x-p152.2"></span>πόστασις</span> and
<span class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.x-p152.3"></span>οὐσία</span> have
in this passage the same or different meanings, see Bull, *Def. Fid.
Nic*. II. 9, 11, p. 314 (*Oxf. Ed*.).  Athanasius expressly states that
they are perfectly equivalent:  “Subsistence (<span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p152.4"></span>ὑ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.x-p152.5"></span>πόστασις</span>) is essence (<span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.x-p152.6"></span>οὐσία</span>), and means
nothing else but very being, which Jeremiah calls existence (<span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.x-p152.7"></span>ὕ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.x-p152.8"></span>παρξις</span>).”  Basil
distinguishes them, and is followed by Bishop Bull, whose opinion is
controverted by Mr. Robertson in an Excursus on the meaning of the
phrase, on p. 77 of his edition of Athanasius in this Series.  The
student who desires to pursue the subject may consult in addition to the
works <span id="page_lxi">p. lxi</span> <span
id="ii.iii.x-Page_lxi"></span>just named, and the authorities therein
mentioned, Dr. Newman’s *Arians of the Fourth Century*, especially chap.
v. sect. i. 3, and Appendix, note iv., on “the terms <span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.x-p152.9"></span>οὐσία</span> and <span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.x-p152.10"></span>ὑ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.x-p152.11"></span>πόστασις</span> as used
in the early Church;” Mr. Robertson’s *Prolegomena*, ch. ii. § 3 (2)
(b); and the Rev. H. A. Wilson’s *Prolegomena* to Gregory of Nyssa, ch.
iv., in this Series.
