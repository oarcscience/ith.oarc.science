<span id="iv.iv.i.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.iv.i.ii-p1.1"></span>Ep. XIV. and XXIII.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.i.ii-p2"></span>(Under the Emperor Valens Cæsarius
returned to public life and was made Quæstor of Bithynia.  While he was
in this office the following letters were written to him by his brother
on behalf of two cousins, Eulalius, who afterwards succeeded Gregory in
the Bishopric of Nazianzus, and with whom Gregory was on terms of
intimate friendship, and Amphilochius, who, through the roguery of a
partner, had got into some trouble at Constantinople about money
matters, and for whom he asks aid and advice.  Some however think that
this letter is not addressed to his brother (who may have been at
Constantinople at the time), but to some other officer of high rank at
the Imperial Court.  Amphilochius soon after retired from the world, and
by <span class="sc"><span id="iv.iv.i.ii-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> 347
was already bishop of the important See of Iconium.  Gregory’s letters
to him are given later in this division.)

<span id="iv.iv.i.ii-p3"></span>Do a kindness to yourself and to me, of
a kind that you will not often have an opportunity of doing, because
opportunities for such kindnesses do not often occur.  Undertake a most
righteous protection of my dear cousins, who are worried more than
enough about a property which they bought as suitable for retirement,
and capable of providing them with some means of living; but after
having completed the purchase they have fallen into many troubles,
partly through finding the vendors dishonest, and partly through being
plundered and robbed by their neighbours, so that it would be a gain to
them to get rid of their acquisition for the price they gave for it,
*plus* the not small sum they have spent on it besides.  If, then, you
would like to transfer the business to yourself, after examining the
contract to see how it may be best and most securely done, this course
would be most acceptable both to them and me; but if you would rather
not, the next best course would be to oppose yourself to the
officiousness and dishonesty of the man, that he may not succeed in
gaining one advantage over their want of business habits, either by
wronging them if they retain their property, or by inflicting loss upon
them if they part with it.  I am really ashamed to write to you on such
a subject.  All the same, since we owe it to them, on account both of
their relationship and of their profession (for of whom would one rather
take care than of such, or what would one be more ashamed of than of
being unwilling to confer such a benefit?) do you either for your own
sake, or for mine, or for the sake of the men themselves, or for all
these sakes put together, by all means do them this kindness.
