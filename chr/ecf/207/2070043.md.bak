<span id="iii.ii.i-p3"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="iii.ii.i-p3.1"></span>Section I.—The Life.</span>

<span id="iii.ii.i-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iii.ii.i-p4.1"></span>S. Gregory Nazianzen</span>, called by the
Ecumenical Council of Ephesus “The Great,” and universally known as “The
Theologian” or “The Divine,” a title which he shares with S. John the
Evangelist alone among the Fathers of the Church, was, like the great
Basil of Cæsarea and his brother Gregory, Bishop of Nyssa, by birth a
Cappadocian.  He was born at Arianzus, a country estate belonging to his
father, in the neighbourhood of Nazianzus.

<span id="iii.ii.i-p5"></span>This latter, sometimes called Nazianzum,
is a place quite unknown to early writers, and derives all its
importance from its connection with our Saint.  The Romans seem to have
called it Diocæsarea.  This would place it in the south-western portion
of the district called Cappadocia Secunda, a sub-division of the
Province, which had previously included the whole country of Cappadocia
under the Prefect of Cæsarea.  The Emperor Valens made the division for
financial purposes about <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.ii.i-p5.1"></span>a.d.</span> 371, and assigned Tyana as its
civil Metropolis, and, as we shall see, thereby caused an ecclesiastical
quarrel which had considerable effect on the life of S. Gregory.  Tyana
was situated at no great distance south and east of Nazianzus, which
place is usually identified with some interesting ruins about eighteen
miles south-east of Ak Serai, on a rocky platform at the foot of the
mountains called Hassan Dagh.  Amongst other ruined buildings here are
the remains of three Byzantine churches of great age, but more recent
than the rest of the town.

<span id="iii.ii.i-p6"></span>His father, who bore the same name with
himself, had originally belonged to an obscure sect called Hypsistarians
or Hypsistians, of whom we know little except what we learn from Gregory
of Nazianzus and his namesake of Nyssa.  They seem to have held a sort
of syncretist doctrine, containing elements derived from heathen,
Christian, and Jewish sources.  They were very strict monotheists,
rejecting both polytheism and the doctrine of the Trinity, and
worshipping the One Supreme Being under the names of The Most High and
The Almighty, and the emblems of Fire and Light, but with no external
cultus; for they rejected sacrifice and every outward form of worship,
holding adoration to be an exclusively interior and spiritual act.  With
singular inconsistency, however, they adopted the observance of the
Jewish Sabbath, and the Levitical prohibition of certain kinds of food. 
They were but few in number, and their influence was insignificant even
in Cappadocia, which was the headquarters of sect. <span
id="fr_2524"></span>[2525](#fn_2524.md)   From this form of error the elder
Gregory was converted by the influence of his wife, Nonna; and soon
after his conversion was consecrated to the bishopric of Nazianzus.

<span id="iii.ii.i-p8"></span>Nonna, the mother of our Saint, was the
daughter of Christian parents, and had been very carefully brought up. 
Like S. John Chrysostom and S. Augustine, Gregory had the inestimable
advantage of being reared at the knee of a mother of conspicuous
holiness.  There <span id="page_188">p. 188</span> <span
id="iii.ii.i-Page_188"></span>were three children of the marriage—a
sister, Gorgonia, probably somewhat older than Gregory, who was
devotedly fond of her, and a brother, Cæsarius, perhaps younger, who was
a distinguished physician, and occupied a post of confidence at the
Court of Constantinople.  Gregory was certainly born at a late period of
the life of his mother.  He tells us that, like so many other holy men
of whom we read both in the Bible and outside its pages, he was
consecrated to God by his mother even before his birth.  The precise
date is uncertain.  There are two lines in his poem on his own life
which seem to indicate clearly that it took place after his father’s
elevation to the Episcopate, or at any rate after his ordination to the
Priesthood.  Speaking of the great desire of the elder Gregory to see
his son ordained to the Priesthood, in order that he might have him as a
coadjutor and aid to his own declining years and failing strength, he
gives the arguments by which the old man sought to persuade him to take
upon himself a burden which he dreaded; and among them we find the
father saying to the son: <span id="fr_2525"></span>[2526](#fn_2525.md)  
“You have not been yet so long in life as I have spent in sacrifice.” 
And though the Roman Catholic writers on the subject strain every nerve
to get rid of the obvious meaning, by ingenious manipulation of the text
or by far-fetched interpretations, yet the conclusion remains unshaken,
and is supported also by another passage, to be cited presently, that he
was at any rate born during the Priesthood of his father.  He tells us
that he left Athens in or about his thirtieth year, <span
id="fr_2526"></span>[2527](#fn_2526.md) and also that the Emperor Julian
was his contemporary there.  Now Julian was at Athens in 355; so that we
must place Gregory’s birth not earlier than 325; and if we give its
natural meaning to the first passage quoted, not earlier than 330, the
latest date available for his father’s consecration as Bishop.  This is
not inconsistent with the Athenian chronology of his life, as he
certainly spent many years there, and probably did not leave the place
till 357.

<span id="iii.ii.i-p11"></span>As soon as the children’s age permitted,
Gregory and his brother Cæsarius were sent to school at Cæsarea, under
the care of a good man named Carterius, who as long as he lived retained
a great influence over the mind of his elder pupil.  This is perhaps the
same Carterius who afterwards presided over the monasteries of Antioch
in Syria, and was one of the instructors of S. John Chrysostom.  The
following is a free rendering of one of four funeral epigrams written in
later years by our Saint in honour of his old friend and tutor:

<span id="iii.ii.i-p12"></span>“Whither, Carterius, best beloved of
friends,

<span id="iii.ii.i-p13"></span>O whither hast thou gone, and left me
here

<span id="iii.ii.i-p14"></span>Alone amid the many toils of earth?

<span id="iii.ii.i-p15"></span>Thou who didst hold the rudder of my
youth,

<span id="iii.ii.i-p16"></span>When in another land I learned to weigh

<span id="iii.ii.i-p17"></span>The words and stories of a learned age;

<span id="iii.ii.i-p18"></span>Thou who didst bind me to the uncarnal
life.

<span id="iii.ii.i-p19"></span>Truly the Christ, whom thou possessest
now,

<span id="iii.ii.i-p20"></span>Took thee unto Himself, the King thou
lov’st.

<span id="iii.ii.i-p21"></span>O thou bright lightning of most glorious
Christ,

<span id="iii.ii.i-p22"></span>Thou best protection of my early days,

<span id="iii.ii.i-p23"></span>Thou charioteer of all my younger life,

<span id="iii.ii.i-p24"></span>Remember now the Gregory whom erst

<span id="iii.ii.i-p25"></span>Thou trainedst in the ways of virtuous
life,

<span id="iii.ii.i-p26"></span>Carterius, master of the life of grace.”

<span id="iii.ii.i-p27"></span>It was probably at Cæsarea that the
acquaintance between Gregory and S. Basil the Great began, which was
afterwards to ripen into a lifelong friendship.  But their association
did <span id="page_189">p. 189</span> <span
id="iii.ii.i-Page_189"></span>not last long at this period, for Basil
soon went to Constantinople to continue his education, while Gregory and
his brother removed to the Palestinian Cæsarea; probably as much for the
sake of making a pilgrimage to the Holy Sepulchre, as for the advantage
of the schools of that learned resort.  Cæsarius soon went on to
Alexandria; but Gregory was tempted by the flourishing Palestinian
school of rhetoric to remain a while and study that art.  One of his
fellow-students here was Euzoius, the future heresiarch.  From Palestine
he too went on to Alexandria, where he found his brother enjoying an
excellent character, and highly distinguished among the students of the
University.  S. Athanasius was at this time the Bishop, and Didymus head
of the famous Catechetical School; but as Gregory, though one of his
orations is a panegyric on S. Athanasius, does not mention having ever
met either of these two great men, we must suppose that the former was
at this time suffering one of his many periods of exile—his second
banishment lasted from 340 to 347.  Gregory does not seem to have
remained very long at Alexandria; the fascination exercised on his mind
by a yet more famous seat of learning—Athens—soon drew him thither.  He
could not even wait for a favourable time of year, but must start at
once.  He took passage in the month of November in a ship bound for
Ægina, with some of whose crew he was acquainted.  They had a prosperous
voyage until they were in sight of Cyprus, when they were assailed by a
tremendous storm, and the ship, swept by the heavy seas, became
waterlogged, and would not answer her helm.  At the same time the
violence of the sea burst the water-tanks, and the ship’s company were
left in dire distress.  Gregory, who was not yet baptized, was thrown
into terrible distress at thus finding himself in peril of death while
yet outside the Covenant of God.  In earnest prayer he renewed his
self-dedication, and vowed to give himself wholly to the service of God,
if his life might be spared to receive Holy Baptism.  He tells the story
at some length and with great graphic power in his long poem on his own
life, from which we subjoin a cento, <span
id="fr_2527"></span>[2528](#fn_2527.md) and also in his oration spoken at
his father’s funeral (Orat. XVIII, c. 31, p. 352 Ed. Ben.).  It is,
however, uncertain whether he was baptized immediately after this
deliverance, or whether he waited till his return to Nazianzus.  At any
rate he reached Athens in safety, and shortly afterwards was joined
there by Basil; when the early acquaintance which was now renewed soon
deepened into an intimacy of brotherly affection, which, though often
sorely tried, never grew cold in Gregory’s heart.  In the funeral
oration which he pronounced <span id="page_190">p. 190</span> <span
id="iii.ii.i-Page_190"></span>over his friend, Gregory has left us a
most interesting account of University life in the middle of the fourth
century, of which we give a summary here, referring the reader for
details to the oration itself, which will be found in the present
volume.  Basil’s reputation, he says, preceded him to Athens, where he
was received with much enthusiasm.  Many of the silliest students there
are mad upon Sophists, and are divided upon the respective merits of
their teachers with as much excitement as is shown by the partisans of
the various chariots in the Hippodromes.  And so a new-comer is laid
hold of by them in this fashion.  First of all, he is entertained by the
first who can get hold of him—either a relation or a friend or a
fellow-countryman, or a leading Sophister, who is in favour with his
master, and touts for him.  There he is unmercifully chaffed, and with
more or less of rough horseplay, by everybody, to take down his pride;
and is then escorted processionally through the streets to the Baths;
after which process he is regarded as free of the students’ guild. 
Basil, however, through the good offices of his friend Gregory, was
spared this trial of his nerves, out of respect for his great
attainments; and this kind action was the beginning of their long and
affectionate intimacy.  Among the students, however, were a number of
young Armenians, some of whom had been at school with Basil, and were
very jealous of him.  These young men, with the object of destroying his
reputation if possible, were continually harassing him with disputations
upon hard and sophistical questions.  Basil was quite able to hold his
own against them, but Gregory, jealous for the honour of his University,
and not at first perceiving the malice of these young men, sided with
them and made the conflict more equal.  As soon, however, as he began to
see their real purpose, he forsook them and took his stand by his
friend, whose victory was thus made not only assured but easy.  The
young gentlemen naturally did not like this, and Gregory became, much to
Basil’s distress, very unpopular among them, as they chose to regard his
conduct in the matter as treason against his University, and especially
against the students of his own year.

<span id="iii.ii.i-p97"></span>The city of Athens at this time was full
of dangerous distractions for young men; feasts, theatres, assemblies,
wine parties, etc.  Gregory and his friend resolved to renounce all
these, and to allow themselves to know only two roads—one, that which
led to the Church and its holy teachers; the other, that which took them
to their University lectures.  Amongst other famous students of
Gregory’s day was Prince Julian, afterwards the Emperor who apostatized
and endeavoured to restore the ancient heathenism, and galvanize it into
something like a new life.  Gregory claims even at this early period to
have foreseen and dreaded the result of Julian’s accession.  “I had long
foreseen,” he says, “how matters would be, from the time that I was with
him at Athens.  He had come there shortly after the violent measures
against his brother, having asked permission of the Emperor to do so. 
He had two reasons for this sojourn—the one more honest, namely, to
visit Greece and its schools, the other more secret and known only to a
few persons, namely, to consult with the heathen priests and charlatans
about his plans, because his wickedness was not as yet declared.  Even
then I made no bad guess about the man, although I am not one of those
skilled in such matters; but I was made a prophet by the unevenness of
his disposition and the very unsettled condition of his mind.  I used
these very words about him:  ‘What an evil the Roman State is
nourishing,’  though I prefaced them with a wish that I might prove a
false prophet.” <span id="page_191">p. 191</span> <span
id="iii.ii.i-Page_191"></span>(Orat. V. 23, 24.)  Gregory must have been
a long time at Athens.  He seems to have gone there at about the age of
eighteen, and not to have left till he was past thirty.  Basil left
before him and returned to Cappadocia, and as soon as he could follow he
went to Constantinople, where he met his brother, who had just come
there to practice as a Court Physician, but resolved to throw up his
practice and return with his brother to Nazianzus.  They found their
parents still living and their father occupying the Episcopal Throne. 
From this time onward Gregory divided his time between his parents and
his friend, living partly at Arianzus, and partly with Basil in Pontus,
in monastic seclusion.  At his Baptism, which it seems most probable
took place at this period, he made a solemn vow never to swear, and to
devote his whole energies and powers solely to the glory of God, and the
defence and spreading of the faith.  Cæsarius did not remain long in the
retirement of home, but soon returned to the Capital, where a brilliant
career seemed opening before him.  Gregory, whose mind was strongly
impressed with the dangers and temptations of a life at Court, did not
altogether approve of this step, yet he does not very severely blame
it.  He himself, however, felt very strongly drawn to the monastic life;
but as retirement from the world did not seem to him to be his vocation,
he resolved to continue to live in the world, and to be a help and
support to his now aged parents, and especially to his father in the
duties of his Episcopate, but at the same time to live under the
strictest ascetic rule.  He had, however, always a secret hankering
after the Solitary life, which he had once ([Ep.
i.](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#000)<span id="iii.ii.i-p97.1"></span>.md)
promised Basil to share with him; and he did find himself able for some
years to spend part of his time with his friend in his retirement in the
wilds of Pontus.  They portioned out their days very carefully between
prayer, meditation and study, and manual labour, on the principles laid
down by Basil in a letter to his friend, which afterwards were developed
into the celebrated Rule still observed by the entire body of the
Religious of the Eastern Church.  Retirement, he says, does not consist
in the act of removal from the world in bodily presence, but in this,
that we tear away the soul from those bodily influences which stir up
the passions; that we give up our parental city and our father’s house,
our possessions and goods, friendship and wedlock, business and
profession, art and science, and everything, and are quite ready to take
into our hearts nothing but the impressions of the divine teaching.

<span id="iii.ii.i-p98"></span>In solitude, Basil thinks, it is possible
altogether to tame the passions, like wild beasts, by gentle treatment;
to lull them to sleep, to disarm them.  By turning away the soul from
the enticements of sense, and withdrawing into one’s self for the
contemplation of God and of Eternal Beauty, it is possible to raise man
to a forgetfulness of natural wants, and to a spiritual freedom from
care.  The means to this spiritual elevation are in his view the reading
of Holy Scripture, which sets before us rules of life—but especially the
pictures of the lives of godly men; Prayer which draws down the Godhead
to us, and makes our mind a pure abode for It; and an earnest silence,
more inclined to learn than to teach, but by no means morose or
unfriendly.  At the same time Basil desires that the outward appearance
of one who thus practises solitude shall be in keeping with his inner
life; with humble downcast eye, and dishevelled hair, in dirty untidy
clothes he must go about, neither lazily loitering nor passionately
quick, but quietly.  His garment, girt upon his loins with a belt, is to
be coarse, not of a bright colour, suited for both summer and winter,
close enough to keep the body warm without additional clothing; and his
shoes adapted to their purpose, but without ornament.  For food, let him
use only the most necessary, chiefly vegetables; for drink, water—at
least in health.  For mealtime, which begins and ends with prayer, one
hour is to be fixed.  Sleep is to be short, light, and never so dead as
to let the soul be open to the impressions of corrupting dreams.

<span id="iii.ii.i-p99"></span><span id="page_192">p. 192</span> <span
id="iii.ii.i-Page_192"></span>They gave themselves especially to the
study of Holy Scripture, and to the practice of devotional exercises. 
In their study their great principle was to interpret the holy writings
not by their own individual judgment, but on the lines laid down for
them by the authority of ancient interpreters.  Of uninspired
commentators they had the greatest respect for Origen, whose errors,
however, they happily avoided.  From his exegetical writings they
compiled a book of Extracts, which they published in twenty-seven books,
to which they gave the name of Philocalia, *i.e*., what in modern
language is called a Christology.  This is happily still extant, and is
valuable as preserving for us many passages otherwise lost, or existing
only in a Latin translation.  Gregory sent a copy of this work to his
friend and subsequent companion at Constantinople, Theodore, Bishop of
Tyana, as an Easter gift many years afterwards, and accompanied it with
a letter, in which he speaks of the work as a memorial of himself and
Basil, and as intended for an aid to scholars; and begs that his friend
will give a proof of its usefulness, with the help of diligence and the
Holy Spirit.  Socrates says that this careful study of Origen was of the
greatest service to the two friends in their subsequent controversies
with the Arians; for these heretics quoted him in support of their
errors, but the two Fathers were enabled to confute them readily, by
shewing that they were completely ignorant of the meaning of Origen’s
argument.

<span id="iii.ii.i-p100"></span>But Gregory does not appear to have
stayed long in Basil’s Monastery;—although Rufinus speaks of a sojourn
of thirteen years.  This cannot for chronological reasons have been a
continuous stay, although it is true that Basil’s monastic life in
Pontus, and Gregory’s various visits to him there extended over a period
of about that length, from his first retirement in 357 to his
consecration to the Episcopate in 370.  It was after about three years
that Gregory returned to Nazianzus (360), possibly, as Ullmann suggests,
because of circumstances which had arisen at his home, which seemed to
call imperatively for his presence in the interests of the peace of the
Diocese, and for the assistance which he might, though a layman, be able
to give to his aged Father, who had got into trouble through a piece of
imprudent conduct.

<span id="iii.ii.i-p101"></span>The Emperor Constantius, who was an
Arian, had in 359 assembled at Ariminum (the modern Rimini) a Council of
400 Western Bishops, and these, partly duped, partly compelled by the
Imperial Officers, had put out a Creed, which, while acknowledging the
proper Deity of the Son, and confessing Him to be <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.ii.i-p101.1"></span>Like</span> the Father, omitted to say Like
<span class="sc"><span id="iii.ii.i-p101.2"></span>In All Points</span>,
and refused the word <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.ii.i-p101.3"></span>Consubstantial</span>; thus, while
condemning the extreme followers of Arius, favouring the views of the
Semi-Arian party.  At the same time another Synod, of 150 Eastern
Bishops, was assembled under Court influence at Seleucia, and
promulgated a similar formula.  The Bishop of Nazianzus, though still as
always a staunch upholder of Nicene orthodoxy, was in some way induced
to attach his signature to this compromising Creed; and this action led
to most important consequences.  The Monks of his Diocese took the
matter up with the usual earnestness of Religious, and, with several
also of the Bishops, withdrew from Communion with their own Bishop. 
This may have been the reason for his son’s return.  He induced his
Father to apologize for his involuntary error and to put out an orthodox
Confession, and so he healed the schism.  To this period belongs his
first Oration on Peace; in which, after an eloquent encomium on the
Religious life, he sets forth the blessings of peace and concord, and
contrasts them with the misery of discord; begging the people to be very
slow indeed on this account to sever themselves from the Communion of
those whom they think to be erring brethren; and thanking God for the
restoration of peace.  He concludes <span id="page_193">p. 193</span>
<span id="iii.ii.i-Page_193"></span>the whole with a splendid setting
forth of the Catholic doctrine concerning the Trinity, in the following
terms:—

<span id="iii.ii.i-p102"></span>“Would to God that none of us may
perish, but that we may all abide in one spirit, with one soul labouring
together for the faith of the Gospel, of one mind, minding the same
thing, armed with the shield of faith, girt about the loins with truth,
knowing only the one war against the Evil One, and those who fight under
his orders, not fearing them that kill the body but cannot lay hold of
the soul; but fearing Him Who is the Lord both of soul and body;
guarding the good deposit which we have received from our fathers,
adoring Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, knowing the Father in the Son, and
the Son in the Holy Ghost—into which Names we were baptized, in Which we
have believed, under Whose banner we have been enlisted ; dividing Them
before we combine Them, and combining before we divide; not receiving
the Three as one Person (for They are not impersonal, or names of one
Person, as though our wealth lay in Names alone and not in facts), but
the Three as one Thing.  For They are One, not in Person, but in
Godhead, Unity adored in Trinity, and Trinity summed up in Unity; all
adorable, all royal, of one throne and one glory; above the world, above
time, uncreated, invisible, impalpable, uncircumscript; in Its relation
to Itself known only to Itself; but to us equally venerable and
adorable; Alone dwelling in the Holiest, and leaving all creatures
outside and shut off, partly by the First Veil, and partly also by the
Second;—by the first, the heavenly and angelic host, parted from
Godhead; and by the second, we men, severed from the Angels.  This let
us do; let this be our mind, Brethren; and those that are otherwise
minded let us look upon as diseased in regard to the truth, and as far
as may be, let us take and cure them; but if they be incurable let us
withdraw from them, lest we share their disease before we impart to them
our own health.  And the God of Peace that passeth all understanding
shall be with you in Christ Jesus our Lord.  Amen.”

<span id="iii.ii.i-p103"></span>Gregory the Elder was now aged and
infirm, and began to feel his need of a Coadjutor in his pastoral
duties.  So, by the great desire of the people of Nazianzus, he ordained
his son to the Priesthood, much against the will of the said son.  This
Ordination took place at some great Festival, probably at Christmas of
the year 361.  Gregory the Younger was much aggrieved at this gentle
violence, which even in after years he describes as an act of tyranny,
and says he cannot bring himself to speak of it in other terms, though
he asks pardon of the Holy Spirit for his language.  Immediately after
his Ordination he made his escape to Pontus, apparently reaching Basil
about Epiphany, 362.  Here he had time for reflection on the obedience
he now owed to his father, not only as son to father, but as Priest to
Bishop; and with a truer view of his duty he returned to Nazianzus,
where he was present in the Church on Easter day 362, and preached his
first Sermon as a Priest, in apology for his reluctance.  Strange to
say, though it was so great a Festival, and though the preacher was so
well known and so much beloved in Nazianzus, the congregation was very
small;—probably many refrained from going to Church in order to mark
their feeling about Gregory’s flight to Pontus.  Anyhow he felt the
discourtesy keenly, and in his next sermon took occasion to reprove them
severely for their inconsistency in receiving him so badly after having
compelled him for their sakes to finally renounce the solitude he loved
so well.  Of this discourse the Abbé Benoît speaks as follows:—

<span id="iii.ii.i-p104"></span>“It is not very long, and it seems to us
a model of the tact and art which a Minister of the Gospel ought to use
in his speech when just grievances compel him to address deserved
reproaches to the faithful.  It would be impossible to blame with
greater force, to complain with <span id="page_194">p. 194</span> <span
id="iii.ii.i-Page_194"></span>more frankness, and yet to do it in a way
less offensive to the hearers.  Praise, indeed, is so mingled with blame
in this discourse, and there is in its tone something so earnest and
affectionate, that the audience, though sharply reprimanded, not only
could not take offence, but was compelled to conceive a yet greater
affection and admiration for him who so reproved them.”

<span id="iii.ii.i-p105"></span>Gregory took the opportunity to write
another very long Oration as his apology for his flight.  In it he sets
forth at great length his conception of the nature and responsibilities
of the Priestly Office, and justifies himself both for having shrunk
from such a charge, and for having so soon returned to take it up.  It
is very improbable that this Oration, numbered II. in the Benedictine
Edition, was ever delivered *vivâ voce*; but it was published, and is a
complete Treatise on the Priesthood, used both by S. John Chrysostom as
the foundation of his Six Books on the Priesthood, and by S. Gregory the
Great as the basis of his Treatise on the Pastoral Rule.  It has also
furnished material to many of the best Ecclesiastical writers of all
ages.

<span id="iii.ii.i-p106"></span>Julian had now succeeded to the Empire,
and had entered Constantinople in 361.  He had by this time completely
broken with the Church, and renounced even the outward semblance of
Christianity.  He persuaded Cæsarius, however, to retain his position at
Court, hoping perhaps that he might succeed in perverting him.  This was
a matter of deep regret to his father and brother, and they felt, the
latter says, obliged to keep the fact from the knowledge of his mother. 
Gregory wrote his brother a letter of most affectionate though earnest
remonstrance; with the result that Cæsarius soon made up his mind to
retire, and put his resolution in practice on the opportunity afforded
by the departure of the Emperor from Constantinople to assume the
direction of his campaign against the Persians.  Nazianzus was not
allowed to remain without attempts being made against its Christianity,
for the Prefect of the Province was sent with an armed escort of
considerable strength to demand possession of the Church.  But the aged
Bishop, supported by his son and by his people, boldly refused to comply
with the Imperial commands, and there seemed such a probability of
powerful resistance that the Prefect felt compelled to withdraw his
force, and never came to Nazianzus again on such an errand.  The
Gregorys, father and son, frequently came into collision with Julian
during his stay in Cappadocia on his way to Persia; and indeed it is not
too much to say that the firm stand which they made on behalf of the
right was, under God, the means of diverting the Emperor from his
purpose of making a vehement assault upon the faith and rights of the
Church in that Province.  As the Abbé Benoît remarks, Julian saw that he
must be careful in dealing with a province where Christian faith was
such a living power, and where a simple village Bishop could dare to
make so stout a stand against Imperial Authority; but he declared his
intention of avenging himself upon his opponents on his return from his
expedition.  The Providence of God, however, interfered, and he never
did return, but was defeated and killed.

<span id="iii.ii.i-p107"></span>In 363 or 364 Basil, like Gregory, was
ordained Priest much against his will.  The Bishop of Cæsarea,
Metropolitan of Cappadocia, was Eusebius.  He had been elected in 362 by
a popular clamour, while yet only a Catechumen, and was very unwillingly
consecrated by the Bishops of the Province.  He felt it necessary to
have at hand a Priest who by his skill in Theology would be a help to
him in the controversies of the times, and he selected Basil.  But for
some unknown reason, possibly no more than a certain jealousy of Basil’s
superior reputation and influence, within a very short time Eusebius
quarrelled with him, and endeavoured to deprive him.  This might easily
have led to a serious schism, had Basil been a self-seeking man, but as
it was, he quietly retired to his Community in Pontus, accompanied <span
id="page_195">p. 195</span> <span id="iii.ii.i-Page_195"></span>by his
friend Gregory, who, however, was not able to remain long in that
congenial society, as his presence was still much needed by his father. 
On the succession of Valens, an Arian, to the Throne of the Empire,
Eusebius wrote to Gregory, entreating him to come to Cæsarea and give
him the benefit of his advice.  Gregory, however, respectfully declined
the invitation on the grounds of his sense of the wrong which his friend
had suffered, and after some correspondence he succeeded in effecting a
reconciliation between the latter and his Metropolitan, in the year 365.

<span id="iii.ii.i-p108"></span>Cæsarius meantime had returned to the
Court and had received from Valens a valuable piece of preferment in
Bithynia; but in the end of 368 or beginning of 369, having been
terrified by a great earthquake, during which he had been in
considerable danger, he was arranging matters for his final retirement,
when he was seized with illness, and very soon died, leaving all his
property, which must have amounted to a considerable sum, to his brother
in trust for the poor.  He was buried at Nazianzus, and on the occasion
of his funeral his brother preached the Sermon which is numbered VIII.
in the Benedictine Edition.  About the same time, but a little later,
Gorgonia also departed, and he preached a funeral sermon on her too. 
Eusebius of Cæsarea died in 370, and Basil at once wrote an urgent
letter to Gregory, begging him to come to Cæsarea, probably in order to
get him elected Archbishop.  Gregory, however, declined to go, and he
and his father exerted themselves to the utmost of their power to
procure the election of Basil; the elder Gregory writing through his son
two letters, one addressed to the people of Cæsarea, the other to the
Provincial Synod, urging Basil’s claims very strongly.  Though ill at
the time, he managed to convey himself to the Metropolis in time for the
meeting of the Synod; and Basil was elected and consecrated.  Gregory
wrote him a letter of congratulation; not, however, a very warm one; but
when troubles began to arise he spoke out with all the fervour of their
early friendship in support of the Archbishop.  About this time Valens
divided the civil Province of Cappadocia into two, one of which had
Cæsarea, the other Tyana, for its Metropolis.  Anthimus, Bishop of the
latter See, thereupon claimed to be *ipso facto* Metropolitan of the new
Province, a claim which Basil strenuously resisted, as savouring of what
we call Erastianism.  A long dispute followed, in the course of which
Basil, to assert his rights as Metropolitan, and to strengthen his own
hands, erected several new Bishoprics in the disputed Province; and to
one of these, Sasima, a miserable little village he consecrated his
friend Gregory, almost by force.  Gregory was, not unnaturally,
indignant at this treatment; while Basil, whose great object had been to
strengthen himself against Anthimus, took it as unkind of Gregory to be
so reluctant to comply with his friend’s wishes.  So the two were for a
long time in very strained relations to one another.  Although, however,
Gregory ultimately yielded to the earnest wish of his father, and
submitted to the authority of the Archbishop, yet he did not disguise
his reluctance, and in the Sermons which he preached on the occasion
(Or. ix. x.) he spoke very strongly on the point.  Anthimus, however,
occupied the village of Sasima with troops, and prevented Gregory from
taking peaceable possession of his See, which it is probable he never
actually administered, for his father begged him to remain at Nazianzus
and continue his services as coadjutor Bishop.  The contest about the
Metropolitanate of Tyana went on for some time, but in the end, mainly
by Gregory’s mediation, it was amicably settled.  In 374 Gregory the
elder died, and his wife also, and thus our Saint was set free from the
charge of the diocese.  He spoke a panegyric at his father’s funeral,
and wrote a number of little “In Memoriam” poems to his mother’s memory;
and out of respect <span id="page_196">p. 196</span> <span
id="iii.ii.i-Page_196"></span>for his father continued to administer the
See of Nazianzus for about a year, making great efforts meanwhile to
secure the appointment of a Bishop.  But, perceiving that his efforts
would be fruitless, because of the devotion of the people to himself, he
at length withdrew, after a very serious illness, to Seleucia in Isauria
(375,) where he lived three or four years, attached to the famous Church
of S. Thecla.  Very little is known of his life there; but it must have
been at this period that he heard of the death of Basil, upon whom two
years later in the Cathedral of Cæsarea he pronounced a splendid
panegyric.

<span id="iii.ii.i-p109"></span>In 379 the Church at Constantinople,
which for forty years had been oppressed by a succession of Arian
Archbishops, and was well nigh crushed out of existence by the multitude
of other heresies, Eunomian, Macedonian, Novatian, Apollinarian, etc.,
which Arian rule had fostered, besought the great Theologian to come to
their aid.  Theodosius the new Emperor, who was a fervent Catholic,
backed their entreaty, as did also numerous Bishops.  Gregory resisted
the call for a long time; but at last he came to see that it was the
will of God that he should accept the Mission, and he consented to go
and fill the gap, until such time as the Catholics of the Capital might
be able to elect an Archbishop.

<span id="iii.ii.i-p110"></span>The following account of the religious
condition of Constantinople at this time is condensed from Ullmann:—

<span id="iii.ii.i-p111"></span>“Religious feeling like everything else
had become to the idle and empty mind a subject of joke and amusement. 
What belonged to the theatre was brought into the Church, and what
belonged to the Church into the theatre.  The better Christian feelings
were not seldom held up in comedies to the sneer of the multitude. 
Everything was so changed by the Constantinopolitans into light jesting,
that earnestness was stripped of its worth by wit, and that which is
holy became a subject for banter and scoffing in the refined
conversation of worldly people.  Yet worse was it that the unbridled
delight of these men in dissipating enjoyments threatened to turn the
Church into a theatre, and the Preacher into a play actor.  If he would
please the multitude, he must adapt himself to their taste, and
entertain them amusingly in the Church.  They demanded also in the
preaching something that should please the ear, glittering declamation
with theatrical gesticulation; and they clapped with the same pleasure
the comedian in the holy place and him on the stage.  And alas there
were found at that period too many preachers who preferred the applause
of men to their souls’ health.  At this period the objects of the faith
excited, particularly in Constantinople, a very universal and lively
interest, which was entertained from the Court downwards, though not
always in the most creditable manner; but it was in great part not the
interest of the heart, but that of a hypercritical and disputatious
intellect, where it was not something far lower, to which the dispute
about matters of faith served only as a pretext for attaining the
exterior aims of avarice or ambition.  While the sanctifying and
beatifying doctrines of the Gospel, which are directed to the conversion
of the whole inner man were let lie quiet, everyone from the Emperor to
the beggar busied himself with incredible interest about a few questions
concerning which the Gospel communicates only just so much as is
beneficial to the human spirit and necessary to salvation, and whose
fuller expression at any rate belongs rather to the school than to
practical life.  But the more violently these doctrinal disputes were
kindled, disturbing and dividing States, cities, and families, so much
the more people lost sight of the practical essentials of Christianity;
it seemed more important to maintain the Tri-unity of God than to love
God with all the heart; to acknowledge the Consubstantiality of the Son,
than to follow Him in humility and self-denial; to defend the
Personality of the Holy Spirit, than to bring forth the fruits of the
Spirit, love, peace, righteousness….In addition to these religious
disputes came also political struggles, namely, the hard-fought wars of
the Roman Empire with the Goths; so that the Empire at large presented
the picture of a sea, tossed by <span id="page_197">p. 197</span> <span
id="iii.ii.i-Page_197"></span>violent storms.  But the unhappy schisms
which at this time were severing Christians everywhere, shewed
themselves in a particularly discouraging form in the Capital.  Under
the late reigns several parties had been favoured; but especially those
which, though again divided among themselves by differences of opinion,
yet agreed in this that they all rejected the Nicene system of
doctrine.  Constantius had bestowed his favour on the Arians; Julian
during his short reign on all parties, at least in appearance,—to crush
them all.  After Jovian’s early death Valens succeeded to power in the
East, and with him, even more than with Constantius, Arianism, which he
not only protected, but also sought to make predominant by horrible
atrocities against the friends of the Nicene Decrees.  These had now
been forbidden the use of all Churches and Church property, and the
Arians had been put in possession of them.  But Constantinople still
remained the scene of ecclesiastical strifes and partizanships.  Here
where with a little good so much evil flowed from all three parts of the
world, all opinions had their adherents; but the following parties in
particular shewed themselves:—The Eunomians, professing an intellectual
theology, which claimed to be able completely to explore the Being of
God by logical definitions, and maintained in strict Arian fashion the
Unlikeness of the Son to the Father, were very numerous in
Constantinople (as is shewn by the fact that most of Gregory’s polemical
utterances were directed against them), and injured earnest religious
thought principally by this, that they used the doctrines of the faith
exclusively as subjects for an argumentative dialectic.  The
Macedonians, addicted to the Semi-Arian dogma of the Like Substance, and
thereby somewhat more nearly approaching the Orthodox, and distinguished
besides by an estimable earnestness of demeanour, and a monk-like
strictness of manner, were indeed themselves excluded by the pure Arians
from the property of the Church, but were ever being abundantly
multiplied, partly in Constantinople itself, partly in the neighbouring
regions of the Hellespont, Thrace, Bithynia, and Phrygia.  The
Novatians, who even overstepped the Macedonians in the strictness of
their practical principles, had somewhat earlier been on the point of
uniting themselves with the Orthodox, from whom they did not differ on
the chief doctrine in dispute, and with whom they found themselves under
like oppression from the Arians; but the malevolent disposition of a few
of the party leaders had stood in the way, and so they remained
separate, and swelled the number of the opponents of Orthodoxy.  Lastly
the Apollinarians too began to establish themselves there.  Their
teaching was opposed to the acknowledgment of true and perfect Manhood
in Jesus (for true Manhood lies in the reason especially); and there was
at that time, as Gregory informs us, a report that an assembly of
Apollinarian bishops was to be held at Constantinople, with a view of
raising their teaching as to Christ into general notice, and forcing it
upon the Churches.

<span id="iii.ii.i-p112"></span>In such a crisis Gregory came most
unwillingly to the Capital.  At first he lodged in the house of a
relation of his own, part of which he arranged as a Chapel, and
dedicated under the title Anastasia, as the place where the Catholic
faith was to rise again.  There he began at once to carry out the rule
of the Church as to daily service, to which he added his own splendid
preaching.

<span id="iii.ii.i-p113"></span>His constant theme was the worship of
the Trinity.  After two Sermons in deprecation of religious
contentiousness, he preached those famous Five Orations which have won
for him the title of the Theologian.  To analyse these belongs to
another portion of this work; it will be enough in this place to say,
that after warning his audience against the frivolity with which the
Arians were dragging religious subjects of the most solemn kind into the
most unsuitable places and occasions, he proceeds in four magnificent
discourses to set forth the Catholic doctrine of the Trinity, shewing
carefully the difference between Sabellian confusion of Persons and
Tritheistic division of Substance.  The Arians, however, persecuted him
<span id="page_198">p. 198</span> <span
id="iii.ii.i-Page_198"></span>bitterly; even, on one occasion at least,
hiring an assassin to murder him; and their persecution was all the more
bitter because of the wonderful success which attended Gregory’s
preaching.  S. Jerome, who came to Constantinople at this time, has left
on record the pleasure with which he listened to and conversed with the
great Defender of the Faith.

<span id="iii.ii.i-p114"></span>Unfortunately Gregory now let himself be
taken in by a plausible adventurer named Maximus, who had come to
Constantinople in the hope of obtaining the Bishopric for himself.  He
attached himself to Gregory and won his confidence, the latter even
going so far as to deliver a panegyric upon him as a sufferer for the
Faith.  After a short time, however, Maximus managed to procure his own
consecration secretly from some Egyptian Bishops, who during an illness
of Gregory enthroned him at night in the Church.  In the morning, when
the people discovered what had been done, they were very indignant, and
Maximus and his friends were driven out of the Church and forced to
leave the City.  Meanwhile the rank and fashion of Constantinople began
to dislike Gregory, who would not condescend to the arts of the popular
preacher, and whose simple retiring life and gentle demeanour were made
matter of reproach to him.  Gregory was quite willing to retire, and was
only prevented from doing so by the earnest remonstrances of his
friends, who solemnly assured him that if he went away the Faith would
depart with him; so he consented to remain till a fitter man could be
found.  Late in 380 Theodosius came to Constantinople, where almost his
first act was to deprive the Arians of the Churches, and to put Gregory
in possession of the Cathedral of S. Sophia.  The next year the great
Council of Eastern Bishops, which ranks as the Second Ecumenical
Council, met at the Capital, under the presidency of Meletius of
Antioch.  Its first care was to sanction the translation of Gregory from
the See of Sasima to that of the Metropolis of the Empire, and to
enthrone him in S. Sophia, and thus he became the recognised Archbishop
of the Imperial City.  Meletius shortly afterwards died, and Gregory
assumed the Presidency of the Council.  He failed in his endeavours to
heal the schism which was troubling the Church of Antioch, and when the
Egyptian Bishops on their arrival shewed a disposition to take up the
case of Maximus, and were determined at any rate to oust Gregory from
the Patriarchal Throne on the ground of a Nicene canon forbidding
translations, which had virtually been rescinded by the act of the
Council, he made up his mind to resign.  He obtained a reluctant assent
to this course from the Emperor, and then took leave of the Synod in one
of the most magnificent of all his Orations, in which he gives a graphic
account of his work in the Metropolis.  Nectarius, Prefect of the City,
who was only a catechumen, was elected in his place, and Gregory went
home to Nazianzus.  He administered the affairs of the Church there for
a little while, and then, having procured the election of Eulalius as
Bishop, he retired to Arianzus, where he passed the few remaining years
of his life in seclusion, but still continued to take an active interest
in the affairs of the Church.  His own city was greatly disturbed by
Apollinarian teachers, whose efforts to establish themselves within the
Church were very persevering.  Apollinarius, or as he is frequently
called in the West, Apollinaris, was a Bishop of Laodicea in the latter
half of the Fourth Century, and was at one time greatly respected for
his learning and orthodoxy by S. Athanasius and S. Basil.  He was even
an instructor of S. Jerome in 374, but he seceded from the Church in the
next year, owing to views which he had come to hold about the nature of
our Lord; these really prepared the way for various forms of the
Monophysite heresy.  He fell into the error of a partial denial of our
Lord’s true Humanity, attributing to Christ a human body and a human
soul, but not a reasoning spirit, whose place, according to him, was
supplied by the Divine Logos.  This view had first appeared in 362, when
it came before a Council at Alexandria.  Those who were accused of
holding it denied it, and expressed their sense of the absurdity of such
a view, pointing out that our Lord could not be said to be really
incarnate if He had no <span id="page_199">p. 199</span> <span
id="iii.ii.i-Page_199"></span>human mind; but about 369 it assumed a
definite form (though even then it was not known to be the teaching of
Apollinarius).  Arguing from the Divinity of Christ that He cannot have
had a human mind, for if He had He would have had sinful inclinations,
and the one Christ would have been two persons, Apollinarius and his
followers went on to maintain that the Incarnation only meant a certain
converse between God and Man; and that Christ’s Body was not really born
of Mary, but was a part of the Godhead converted into flesh.  S.
Athanasius wrote two Books against these two propositions, but did not
name Apollinarius, most probably because he did not believe him to be
committed to them.  The fundamental error of the system was the idea
that the Incarnation was, not the Union of the two Natures, but only a
blending so close, that in the mind of these teachers all the Divine
Attributes were transferred to the human nature, and all the human ones
to the Divine, and the two were merged in one compound being.

<span id="iii.ii.i-p115"></span>In 377 a Roman Synod excommunicated
Apollinarius and his adherents, and S. Damasus wrote a letter containing
twenty-five anathemas, which he sent to Paulinus of Antioch and others. 
This condemnation is in almost the identical words used by S. Gregory in
the first of two letters on the question which he wrote to Cledonius, a
Priest of Nazianzus, and which were adopted as symbolic at the Councils
of Ephesus and Chalcedon.  Of these letters Canon Bright says that they
belong to that class of documents of the Fourth Century which refuted by
anticipation the heresies of the Fifth.  Gregory affirmed True Godhead
and True Manhood to be combined in the One Person of the Crucified, Who
was the adorable Son, Whose Mother was the Mother of God, and Who
assumed, in order to redeem it, the entire nature that fell in Adam.  In
his seclusion, says Mr. Crake, his sole luxuries were a garden and a
fountain.  He spent his last days in continual devotion.  His knees were
worn with kneeling, and his whole thoughts and aspirations had gone
before to the long home to which he was hastening.  After the manner of
the Saints, he was very rigorous in his self-denial.  His bed was of
straw with a covering of sackcloth, and a single tunic was all the
outward clothing of him who had been Bishop of Constantinople.  Yet his
glory was only in the Lord.  “As a fish cannot swim without water, and a
bird cannot fly without air, he said, so a Christian cannot advance a
single step without Christ.”  He died in 391, and in the same year that
he passed from the roll of the earthly episcopate Augustine was ordained
Priest at Hippo Regius in Africa.

<span id="iii.ii.i-p116"></span>Ullmann gives the following description
of his character and personal appearance:

<span id="iii.ii.i-p117"></span>“Gregory was of middle height and
somewhat pale; but his pallor became him.  His hair was thick and
blanched by age, his short beard and conspicuous eyebrows were thicker. 
On his right eye he had a scar.  His manner was friendly and attractive;
his conduct simple.  The keynote of his inner being was piety; his soul
was full of fiery strength of faith, turned to God and Christ; a lofty
zeal for divine things led him all his life.  This zeal manifested
itself above all in a steadfast adherence to and defence of certain
dogmas which that age held to be specially important; as well as in
lively conflicts, not always free from partisanship, with opposing
convictions; but not less in a hearty and living apprehension of
practical Christianity, the establishment and enlargement of which in
men’s minds was to him all important.  His asceticism was overdone; it
injured his health; yet it did not degenerate into hypocrisy; it was to
him the means for elevating and liberating the mind, but not in and for
its own sake a higher virtue.  An inborn and inbred love of solitude
hindered him from turning all his powers to a publicly useful activity. 
His seclusion did not allow him to become familiar with the knowledge of
men and of the world; lacking in knowledge of men, carelessly confident,
sometimes distrustful and bitter in his judgment of others, he demanded
<span id="page_200">p. 200</span> <span
id="iii.ii.i-Page_200"></span>from others much, but from himself most. 
Susceptible of great resolves, and full of fiery zeal for all good, he
was not always steadfast and persevering in carrying them out.  In
endurance and conflict he was noble and high-minded; in victory
moderate; in prosperity humble; never flattering the great, but an ever
ready helper to the oppressed and persecuted, and to the poor a loving
father.  The most excellent qualities were in Gregory mingled with
faults; he was not quite free from vanity, he was very irritable and
sensitive, but also readily forgave and cherished no grudges.  He was a
man feeling after holiness, and striving after the highest good, but not
perfect, as no man upon earth is.”

<span id="iii.ii.i-p118"></span>Before leaving Constantinople he made
his will, in which he bequeathed all his property to the Deacon Gregory
for life, with reversion to the poor of Nazianzus.

<span id="iii.ii.i-p82"></span>And Egypt crushed by scourges, chiefs and
all—

<span id="iii.ii.i-p83"></span>Nature subdued, and walls thrown down by
shout.

<span id="iii.ii.i-p84"></span>And, adding mine to those old famous
acts,

<span id="iii.ii.i-p85"></span>Thine own, I said, am I, both erst and
now;

<span id="iii.ii.i-p86"></span>Twice shalt Thou take me for Thine own, a
gift

<span id="iii.ii.i-p87"></span>Of earth and sea, a doubly hallowed gift,

<span id="iii.ii.i-p88"></span>By prayers of mother and by fateful sea.

<span id="iii.ii.i-p89"></span>To Thee I live, if I escape the waves,

<span id="iii.ii.i-p90"></span>And gain baptismal dews; and Thou wilt
lose

<span id="iii.ii.i-p91"></span>A faithful servant if Thou cast me off,

<span id="iii.ii.i-p92"></span>E’en now Thine own disciple, in the deep;

<span id="iii.ii.i-p93"></span>Shake off for me Thy slumber, and arise,

<span id="iii.ii.i-p94"></span>And stay my fear.  So prayed I—and the
noise

<span id="iii.ii.i-p95"></span>Of winds grew still, the surges ceased,
the ship

<span id="iii.ii.i-p96"></span>Held straight upon her course; my prayer
was heard.
