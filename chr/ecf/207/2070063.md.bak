<span id="iii.xx-p1"></span> <span class="c21"><span
id="iii.xx-p1.1"></span>Oration XXXVII.</span>

<span id="iii.xx-p2"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="iii.xx-p2.1"></span>On the Words of the Gospel, “When Jesus Had
Finished These Sayings,” Etc.—</span>[Matt.
19.1](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#001.md)<span
id="iii.xx-p2.2"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="iii.xx-p2.3"></span>[Matt. xix.

<span id="iii.xx-p3"></span>I.  <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.xx-p3.1"></span>Jesus</span> Who Chose The Fishermen, Himself
also useth a net, and changeth place for place.  Why?  Not only that He
may gain more of those who love God by His visitation; but also, as it
seems to me, that He may hallow more places.  To the Jews He becomes as
a Jew that He may gain the Jews; to them that are under the Law as under
the Law, that He may redeem them that are under the Law; to the weak as
weak, that He may save the weak.  He is made all things to all men that
He may gain all.  Why do I say, All things to all men?  For even that
which Paul could not endure to say of himself I find that the Saviour
suffered.  For He is made not only a Jew, and not only doth He take to
Himself all monstrous and vile names, but even that which is most
monstrous of all, even very sin and very curse; not that He is such, but
He is called so.  For how can He be sin, Who setteth us free from sin;
and how can He be a curse, Who redeemeth us from the curse of the
Law? <span id="fr_3811"></span>[3812](#fn_3811.md)   But it is in order
that He may carry His display of humility even to this extent, and form
us to that humility which is the producer of exaltation.  As I said
then, He is made a Fisherman; He condescendeth to all; He casteth the
net; He endureth all things, that He may draw up the fish from the
depths, that is, Man who is swimming in the unsettled and bitter waves
of life.

<span id="iii.xx-p5"></span>II.  Therefore now also, when He had
finished these sayings He departed from Galilee and came into the coasts
of Judea beyond Jordan; He dwelleth well in Galilee, in order that the
people which sat in darkness may see great Light. <span
id="fr_3812"></span>[3813](#fn_3812.md)   He removeth to Judea in order
that He may persuade people to rise up from the Letter and to follow the
Spirit.  He teacheth, now on a mountain; now He discourseth on a plain;
now He passeth over into a ship; now He rebuketh the surges.  And
perhaps He goes to sleep, in order that He may bless sleep also; perhaps
He is tired that He may hallow weariness also; perhaps He weeps that He
may make tears blessed.  He removeth from place to place, Who is not
contained in any place; the timeless, the bodiless, the uncircumscript,
the same Who was and is; Who was both above time, and came under time,
and was invisible and is seen.  He was in the beginning and was with
God, and was God. <span id="fr_3813"></span>[3814](#fn_3813.md)   The word
Was occurs the third time to be confirmed by number.  What He was He
laid aside; what He was not He assumed; not that He became two, but He
deigned to be One made out of the two.  For both are God, that which
assumed, and that which was assumed; two Natures meeting in One, not two
Sons (let us not give a false account of the blending).  He who is such
and so great—but what has befallen me?  I have fallen into human
language.  For how can So Great be said of the Absolute, and how can
That which is without quantity be called Such?  But pardon the word, for
I am speaking of the greatest things with a limited instrument.  And
That great and long-suffering and formless and bodiless Nature will
endure this, namely, my words as if of a body, and weaker than the
truth.  For if He condescended to Flesh, He will also endure such
language.

<span id="iii.xx-p8"></span>III.  And great multitudes followed Him, and
He healed them there, where the multitude was greater.  If He had abode
upon His own eminence, if He had not condescended to infirmity, if He
had remained what He was, keeping Himself unapproachable and
incomprehensible, a few perhaps would have followed Him—perhaps not even
a few, possibly <span id="page_339">p. 339</span> <span
id="iii.xx-Page_339"></span>only Moses—and He only so far as to see with
difficulty the Back Parts of God. <span
id="fr_3814"></span>[3815](#fn_3814.md)   For He penetrated the cloud,
either being placed outside the weight of the body or being withdrawn
from his senses; for how could he have gazed upon the subtlety, or the
incorporeity, or I know not how one should call it, of God, being
incorporate and using material eyes?  But inasmuch as He strips Himself
for us, inasmuch as He comes down (and speak of an exinanition, as it
were, a laying aside and a diminution of His glory), He becomes by this
comprehensible.

<span id="iii.xx-p10"></span>IV.  And pardon me meanwhile that I again
suffer a human affection.  I am filled with indignation and grief for my
Christ (and would that you might sympathize with me) when I see my
Christ dishonoured on this account on which He most merited honour.  Is
He on this account to be dishonoured, tell me, that for you He was
humble?  Is He therefore a Creature, because He careth for the
creature?  Is He therefore subject to time, because He watches over
those who are subject to time?  Nay, He beareth all things, He endureth
all things. <span id="fr_3815"></span>[3816](#fn_3815.md)   And what
marvel?  He put up with blows, He bore spittings, He tasted gall for my
taste.  And even now He bears to be stoned, not only by those who deal
despitefully with Him, but also by ourselves who seem to reverence Him. 
For to use corporeal names when discoursing of the incorporeal is
perhaps the part of those who deal despitefully and stone Him; but
pardon, I say again to our infirmity, for I do not willingly stone Him;
but having no other words to use, we use what we have.  Thou art called
the Word, and Thou art above Word; Thou art above Light, yet art named
Light; Thou art called Fire not as perceptible to sense, but because
Thou purgest light and worthless matter; a Sword, because Thou severest
the worse from the better; a Fan, because Thou purgest the
threshing-floor, and blowest away all that is light and windy, and
layest up in the garner above all that is weighty and full; an Axe,
because Thou cuttest down the worthless fig-tree, after long patience,
because Thou cuttest away the roots of wickedness; the Door, because
Thou bringest in; the Way, because we go straight; the Sheep, because
Thou art the Sacrifice; the High Priest, because Thou offerest the Body
the Son, because Thou art of the Father.  Again I stir men’s tongues;
again some men rave against Christ, or rather against me, who have been
deemed worthy to be a herald of the Word.  I am like John, The Voice of
one crying in the wilderness <span id="fr_3816"></span>[3817](#fn_3816.md)
—a wilderness that once was dry, but now is only too populous.

<span id="iii.xx-p13"></span>V.  But, as I was saying, to return to my
argument; for this reason great multitudes followed Him, because He
condescended to our infirmities.  What next?  The Pharisees also, it
says, came unto Him, tempting Him, and saying unto Him, is it lawful for
a man to put away his wife for every cause?  Again the Pharisees tempt
Him; again they who read the Law do not know the Law; again they who are
expounders of the Law need others to teach them.  It was not enough that
Sadducees should tempt Him concerning the Resurrection, and Lawyers
question Him about perfection, and the Herodians about the poll-tax, and
others about authority; but some one must also ask about Marriage at Him
who cannot be tempted, the Creator of wedlock, Him who from the First
Cause made this whole race of mankind.  And He answered and said unto
them, Have ye not read that He which made them at the beginning made
them male and female?  He knoweth how to solve some of their questions
and to bridle others.  When He is asked, By what authority doest thou
these things? He Himself, because of the utter ignorance of those who
asked Him, replies with another question; The baptism of John, was it
from Heaven or of men?  He on both sides entangles His questioners, so
that we also are able, following the example of Christ, sometimes to
check those who argue with us over-officiously, and with still more
absurd questions to solve the absurdity of their questions.  For we too
are wise in vanity at times, if I may boast of the things of folly.  But
when He sees a question that calls for reasoning, then He does not deem
His questioners unworthy of prudent answers.

<span id="iii.xx-p14"></span>VI.  The question which you have put seems
to me to do honour to chastity, and to demand a kind reply.  Chastity,
in respect of which I see that the majority of men are ill-disposed, and
that their laws are unequal and irregular.  For what was the reason why
they restrained the woman, but indulged the man, and that a woman who
practises evil against her husband’s bed is an adulteress, and the
penalties of the law for this are very severe; but if the husband
commits fornication against his wife, he has no account to give?  I do
not accept this legislation; I do not approve this custom.  They who
made the Law were men, <span id="page_340">p. 340</span> <span
id="iii.xx-Page_340"></span>and therefore their legislation is hard on
women, since they have placed children also under the authority of their
fathers, while leaving the weaker sex uncared for.  God doth not so; but
saith Honour thy father and thy mother, which is the first commandment
with promise; that it may be well with thee; and, He that curseth father
or mother, let him die the death.  Similarly He gave honour to good and
punishment to evil.  And, The blessing of a father strengtheneth the
houses of children, but the curse of a mother uprooteth the
foundations. <span id="fr_3817"></span>[3818](#fn_3817.md)   See the
equality of the legislation.  There is one Maker of man and woman; one
debt is owed by children to both their parents.

<span id="iii.xx-p16"></span>VII.  How then dost thou demand Chastity,
while thou dost not thyself observe it?  How dost thou demand that which
thou dost not give?  How, though thou art equally a body, dost thou
legislate unequally?  If thou enquire into the worse—The Woman Sinned,
and so did Adam. <span id="fr_3818"></span>[3819](#fn_3818.md)   The
serpent deceived them both; and one was not found to be the stronger and
the other the weaker.  But dost thou consider the better?  Christ saves
both by His Passion.  Was He made flesh for the Man?  So He was also for
the woman.  Did He die for the Man?  The Woman also is saved by His
death.  He is called of the seed of David; <span
id="fr_3819"></span>[3820](#fn_3819.md) and so perhaps you think the Man is
honoured; but He is born of a Virgin, and this is on the Woman’s side. 
They two, He says, shall be one Flesh; so let the one flesh have equal
honour.  And Paul legislates for chastity by His example.  How, and in
what way?  This Sacrament is great, he says, But I speak concerning
Christ and the Church. <span id="fr_3820"></span>[3821](#fn_3820.md)   It
is well for the wife to reverence Christ through her husband:  and it is
well for the husband not to dishonor the Church through his wife.  Let
the wife, he says, see that she reverence her husband, for so she does
Christ; but also he bids the husband cherish his wife, for so Christ
does the Church. <span id="fr_3821"></span>[3822](#fn_3821.md)   Let us,
then, give further consideration to this saying.

<span id="iii.xx-p21"></span>VIII.  Churn milk and it will be
butter; <span id="fr_3822"></span>[3823](#fn_3822.md) examine this and
perhaps you may find something more nourishing in it.  For I think that
the Word here seems to deprecate second marriage.  For, if there were
two Christs, there may be two husbands or two wives; but if Christ is
One, one Head of the Church, let there be also one flesh, and let a
second be rejected; and if it hinder the second what is to be said for a
third?  The first is law, the second is indulgence, the third is
transgression, and anything beyond this is swinish, such as has not even
many examples of its wickedness.  Now the Law grants divorce for every
cause; but Christ not for every cause; but He allows only separation
from the whore; and in all other things He commands patience.  He allows
to put away the fornicatress, because she corrupts the offspring; but in
all other matters let us be patient and endure; or rather be ye <span
id="fr_3823"></span>[3824](#fn_3823.md) enduring and patient, as many as
have received the yoke of matrimony.  If you see lines or marks upon
her, take away her ornaments; if a hasty tongue, restrain it; if a
meretricious laugh, make it modest; if immoderate expenditure or drink,
reduce it; if unseasonable going out, shackle it; if a lofty eye,
chastise it.  It is uncertain which is in danger, the separator or the
separated.  Let thy fountain of water, it says, be only thine own, and
let no stranger share it with thee; <span
id="fr_3824"></span>[3825](#fn_3824.md) and, let the colt of thy favours
and the stag of thy love company with thee; do thou then take care not
to be a strange river, nor to please others better than thine own wife. 
But if thou be carried elsewhere, then thou makest a law of lewdness for
thy partner also.  Thus saith the Saviour.

<span id="iii.xx-p25"></span>IX.  But what of the Pharisees?  To them
this word seems harsh.  Yes, for they are also displeased at other noble
words—both the older Pharisees, and the Pharisees of the present day. 
For it is not only race, but disposition also that makes a Pharisee. 
Thus also I reckon as an Assyrian or an Egyptian him who is ranged among
these by his character.  What then say the Pharisees?  If the case of
the man be so with his wife, it is not good to marry.  Is it only now, O
Pharisee, that thou understandest this, It is not good to marry? <span
id="fr_3825"></span>[3826](#fn_3825.md)   Didst thou not know it before
when thou sawest widowhoods, and orphanhoods, and untimely deaths, and
mourning succeeding to shouting, and funerals coming upon weddings, and
childlessness, and all the comedy or tragedy that is connected with
this?  Either is most appropriate language.  It is good to marry; I too
admit it, for marriage is honourable in all, and the bed
undefiled. <span id="fr_3826"></span>[3827](#fn_3826.md)   It is good for
the temperate, not for those who are insatiable, and who desire to give
more than due honour to the flesh.  When marriage is only marriage and
conjunction and the desire for a succession of children, marriage is
honourable, for it brings into the world more to please God.  But <span
id="page_341">p. 341</span> <span id="iii.xx-Page_341"></span>when it
kindles matter, and surrounds us with thorns, and as it were discovers
the way of vice, then I too say, It is not good to marry.

<span id="iii.xx-p28"></span>X.  Marriage is honourable; but I cannot
say that it is more lofty than virginity; for virginity were no great
thing if it were not better than a good thing.  Do not however be angry,
ye women that are subject to the yoke.  We must obey God rather than
man.  But be ye bound together, both virgins and wives, and be one in
the Lord, and each others’ adornment.  There would be no celibate if
there were no marriage.  For whence would the virgin have passed into
this life?  Marriage would not have been venerable unless it had borne
virgin fruit to God and to life.  Honour thou also thy mother, of whom
thou wast born.  Honour thou also her who is of a mother and is a
mother. <span id="fr_3827"></span>[3828](#fn_3827.md)   A mother she is
not, but a Bride of Christ she is.  The visible beauty is not hidden,
but that which is unseen is visible to God.  All the glory of the King’s
Daughter is within, <span id="fr_3828"></span>[3829](#fn_3828.md) clothed
with golden fringes, embroidered whether by actions or by
contemplation.  And she who is under the yoke, let her also in some
degree be Christ’s; and the virgin altogether Christ’s.  Let the one be
not entirely chained to the world, <span
id="fr_3829"></span>[3830](#fn_3829.md) and let the other not belong to the
world at all.  For that which is a part to the yoked, is to the virgin
all in all.  Hast thou chosen the life of Angels?  Art thou ranked among
the unyoked?  Sink not down to the flesh; sink not down to matter; be
not wedded to matter, while otherwise thou remainest unwedded.  A
lascivious eye guardeth not virginity; a meretricious tongue mingles
with the Evil One; feet that walk disorderly accuse of disease or
danger.  Let the mind also be virgin; let it not rove about; let it not
wander; let it not carry in itself forms of evil things (for the form is
a part of harlotry); let it not make idols in its soul of hateful
things.

<span id="iii.xx-p32"></span>XI.  But He said unto them, All men cannot
receive this saying, save they to whom it is given.  Do you see the
sublimity of the matter?  It is found to be nearly incomprehensible. 
For surely it is more than carnal that that which is born of flesh
should not beget to the flesh.  Surely it is Angelic that she who is
bound to flesh should live not according to flesh, but be loftier than
her nature.  The flesh bound her to the world, but reason led her up to
God.  The flesh weighed her down, but reason gave her wings; the flesh
bound her, but desire loosed her.  With thy whole soul, O Virgin, be
intent upon God (I give this same injunction to men and to women); and
do not take the same view in other respects of what is honourable as the
mass of men do; of family, of wealth, of throne, of dynasty, of that
beauty which shews itself in complexion and composition of members, the
plaything of time and disease.  If thou hast poured out upon God the
whole of thy love; if thou hast not two objects of desire, both the
passing and the abiding, both the visible and the invisible, then thou
hast been so pierced by the arrow of election, and hast so learned the
beauty of the Bridegroom, that thou too canst say with the bridal drama
and song, thou art sweetness and altogether loveliness.

<span id="iii.xx-p33"></span>XII.  You see how streams confined in lead
pipes, through being much compressed and carried to one point, often so
far depart from the nature of water that that which is pushed from
behind will often flow constantly upwards.  So if thou confine thy
desire, and be wholly joined to God, thou wilt not fall downward; thou
wilt not be dissipated; thou wilt remain entirely Christ’s, until thou
see Christ thy Bridegroom.  Keep thyself unapproachable, both in word
and work and life, and thought and action.  From all sides the Evil One
interferes with thee; he spies thee everywhere, where he may strike,
where wound thee; let him not find anything bared and ready to his
stroke.  The purer he sees thee, the more he strives to stain thee, for
the stains on a shining garment are more conspicuous.  Let not eye draw
eye, nor laughter, nor familiarity night, lest night bring destruction. 
For that which is gradually drawn away and stolen, works a mischief
which is unperceived at the time, but yet attains to the consummation of
wickedness.

<span id="iii.xx-p34"></span>XIII.  All men, He saith, cannot receive
this saying, but they to whom it is given.  When you hear this, It is
given, do not understand it in a heretical fashion, and bring in
differences of nature, the earthly and the spiritual and the mixed.  For
there are people so evilly disposed as to think that some men are of an
utterly ruined nature, and some of a nature which is saved, and that
others are of such a disposition as their will may lead them to, either
to the better, or to the worse.  For that men may have a certain
aptitude, one more, another less, I too admit; but not that this
aptitude alone suffices for perfection, but that it is reason which
calls this out, that <span id="page_342">p. 342</span> <span
id="iii.xx-Page_342"></span>nature may proceed to action, just as fire
is produced when a flint is struck with iron.  When you hear To whom it
is given, add, And it is given to those who are called and to those who
incline that way.  For when you hear, Not of him that willeth, nor of
him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy, <span
id="fr_3830"></span>[3831](#fn_3830.md) I counsel you to think the same. 
For since there are some who are so proud of their successes that they
attribute all to themselves and nothing to Him that made them and gave
them wisdom and supplied them with good; such are taught by this word
that even to wish well needs help from God; or rather that even to
choose what is right is divine and a gift of the mercy of God.  For it
is necessary both that we should be our own masters and also that our
salvation should be of God.  This is why He saith not of him that
willeth; that is, not of him that willeth only, nor of him that runneth
only, but also of God.  That sheweth mercy.  Next; since to will also is
from God, he has attributed the whole to God with reason.  However much
you may run, however much you may wrestle, yet you need one to give the
crown.  Except the Lord build the house, they laboured in vain that
built it:  Except the Lord keep the city, in vain they watched that keep
it. <span id="fr_3831"></span>[3832](#fn_3831.md)   I know, He says, that
the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, <span
id="fr_3832"></span>[3833](#fn_3832.md) nor the victory to the fighters,
nor the harbours to the good sailors; but to God it belongs both to work
victory, and to bring the barque safe to port.

<span id="iii.xx-p38"></span>XIV.  In another place it is also said and
understood, and perhaps it is necessary that I should add it as follows
to what has already been said, in order that I may impart to you also my
wealth.  The Mother of the Sons of Zebedee, in an impulse of parental
affection, asked a thing in ignorance of the measure of what she was
asking, <span id="fr_3833"></span>[3834](#fn_3833.md) but pardonably,
through the excess of her love and of the kindness due to her children. 
For there is nothing more affectionate than a Mother,—and I speak of
this that I may lay down a law for honouring Mothers.  Their mother,
then, asked Jesus that they might sit, the one on His right hand, the
other on his left.  But what saith the Saviour?  He first asks if they
can drink the Cup Which He Himself was about to drink; and when this was
professed, and the Saviour accepted the profession (for He knew that
they were being perfected by the same, or rather that they would be
perfected thereby); what saith He?  “They shall drink the cup; but to
sit on My right hand and on My left—it is not Mine, He saith, to give
this, but to whom it hath been given.”  Is then the ruling mind
nothing?  Nothing the labour?  Nothing the reasoning?  Nothing the
philosophy?  Nothing the fasting?  Nothing the vigils, the sleeping on
the ground, the shedding floods of tears?  Is it for nothing of these,
but in accordance with some election by lot, that a Jeremias is
sanctified, and others are estranged from the womb?

<span id="iii.xx-p40"></span>XV.  I fear lest some monstrous reasoning
may come in, as of the soul having lived elsewhere, and then having been
bound to this body, and that it is from that other life that some
receive the gift of prophecy, and others are condemned, namely, those
who lived badly.  But since such a conception is too absurd, and
contrary to the traditions of the Church (others if they like may play
with such doctrines, but it is unsafe for us to play with them); we must
in this place too add to the words “To whom it hath been given,” this,
“who are worthy;” who have not only received this character from the
Father, but have given it to themselves.

<span id="iii.xx-p41"></span>XVI.  For there are eunuchs which were made
eunuchs from their mother’s womb, etc.  I should very much like to be
able to say something bold about eunuchs.  Be not proud, ye who are
eunuchs by nature.  For, in point of self-restraint, this is perhaps
unwilling.  For it has not come to the test, nor has your self-restraint
been proved by trial.  For the good which is by nature is not a subject
of merit; that which is the result of purpose is laudable.  What merit
has fire for burning, for it is its nature to burn?  What merit has
water for falling, a property given to it by its Maker?  What thanks
does the snow get for its coldness, or the sun for its shining?—It
shines even if it does not wish.  Claim merit if you please by willing
the better things.  You will claim it if, being carnal, you make
yourself spiritual; if, while drawn down by the leaden flesh, you
receive wings from reason; if though lowly born, you are found to be
heavenly; if while chained down to the flesh, you shew yourself superior
to the flesh.

<span id="iii.xx-p42"></span>XVII.  Since then, natural chastity is not
meritorious, I demand something else from the eunuchs.  Do not go a
whoring in respect of the Godhead.  Having been wedded to Christ, do not
dishonour Christ.  Being perfected by the spirit, do not make the Spirit
your own equal.  If I yet pleased men, says <span id="page_343">p.
343</span> <span id="iii.xx-Page_343"></span>Paul, I should not be the
servant of Christ. <span id="fr_3834"></span>[3835](#fn_3834.md)   If I
worshipped a creature, I should not be called a Christian.  For why is
Christianity precious?  Is it not that Christ is God, unless my mingling
with Him in love is a mere human passion?  And yet I honour Peter, but I
am not called a Petrine; and Paul, but have never been called a
Pauline.  I cannot allow myself to be named after a man, who am born of
God.  So then, if it is because you believe Him to be God that you are
called a Christian, may you ever be so called, and may you remain in
both the name and the thing; but if you are called from Christ only
because you have an affection for Him, you attribute no more to him than
other names which are given from some practice or fact.

<span id="iii.xx-p44"></span>XVIII.  Consider those men who are devoted
to horse racing.  They are named after the colours and the sides on
which they have placed themselves.  You know the names without my
mentioning them.  If it is thus that you have got the name of Christian,
the mere title is a very small thing even though you pride yourself upon
it.  But if it is because you believe Him to be God, shew your faith by
your works.  If the Son is a creature, even now also you are worshipping
the creature instead of the Creator.  If the Holy Ghost is a creature,
you are baptized in vain, and are only sound on two sides, or rather not
even on them; but on one you are altogether in danger.  Imagine the
Trinity to be a single pearl, alike on all sides and equally
glistening.  If any part of the pearl be injured; the whole beauty of
the stone is gone.  So when you dishonour the Son in order to honour the
Father, He does not accept your honour.  The Father doth not glory in
the dishonour of the Son.  If a wise Son maketh a glad Father, <span
id="fr_3835"></span>[3836](#fn_3835.md) how much more doth the honour of
the Son become that of the Father!  And if you also accept this saying,
My Son, glory not in the dishonour of thy Father, <span
id="fr_3836"></span>[3837](#fn_3836.md) similarly the Father doth not glory
in the Son’s dishonour.  If you dishonour the Holy Ghost, the Son
receiveth not your honour.  For though He be not of the Father in the
same way as the Son, yet He is of the same Father.  Either honour the
whole or dishonour the whole, so as to have a consistent mind.  I cannot
accept your half piety.  I would have you altogether pious, but in the
way that I desire.  Pardon my affection:  I am grieved even for those
who hate me.  You were one of my members, even though you are now cut
off:  perhaps you will again become a member; and therefore I speak
kindly.  Thus much for the sake of the Eunuchs, that they may be chaste
in respect of the Godhead.

<span id="iii.xx-p47"></span>XIX.  For it is not only bodily sin which
is called fornication and adultery, but any sin you have committed, and
especially transgression against that which is divine.  Perhaps you ask
how we can prove this:—They went a whoring, it says, with their own
inventions. <span id="fr_3837"></span>[3838](#fn_3837.md)   Do you see an
impudent act of fornication?  And again, They committed adultery in the
wood. <span id="fr_3838"></span>[3839](#fn_3838.md)   See you a kind of
adulterous religion?  Do not then commit spiritual adultery, while
keeping your bodies chaste.  Do not shew that it is unwillingly you are
chaste in body, by not being chaste where you *can* commit fornication. 
Why have you done your impiety?  Why are you hurried to vice, so that it
is all one to call a man a Eunuch or a villain?  Place yourselves on the
side of men, and, even though so late, have some manly thoughts.  Avoid
the women’s apartments; do not let the disgrace of proclamation be added
to the disgrace of the name.  Would you have us persevere a little
longer in this discourse, or are you tired with what we have said?  Nay,
by what follows let even the eunuchs be honoured.  For the word is one
of praise.

<span id="iii.xx-p50"></span>XX.  There are, He says, some eunuchs which
were so born from their mother’s womb; and there are some eunuchs which
were made eunuchs of men; and there be eunuchs which have made
themselves eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heaven’s sake.  He that is able to
receive it, let him receive it.  I think that the discourse would sever
itself from the body, and represent higher things by bodily figures; for
to stop the meaning at bodily eunuchs would be small and very weak, and
unworthy of the Word; and we must understand in addition something
worthy of the Spirit.  Some, then, seem by nature to incline to good. 
And when I speak of nature, I am not slighting free will, but supposing
both—an aptitude for good, and that which brings the natural aptitude to
effect.  And there are others whom reason cleanses, by cutting them off
from the passions.  These I imagine to be meant by those whom men have
made Eunuchs, when the word of teaching distinguishing the better from
the worse and rejecting the one and commanding the other (like the
verse, Depart from evil and do good), <span
id="fr_3839"></span>[3840](#fn_3839.md) works spiritual chastity.  This
sort of making eunuchs I ap<span id="page_344">p. 344</span> <span
id="iii.xx-Page_344"></span>prove; and I highly praise both teachers and
taught, that the one have nobly effected, and the other still more nobly
endured, the cutting off.

<span id="iii.xx-p52"></span>XXI.  And there be eunuchs which have made
themselves eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heaven’s sake.  Others, too, who
have not met with teachers, have been laudable teachers to themselves. 
No father nor mother, no Priest or Bishop, nor any of those commissioned
to teach, taught you your duty; but by moving reason in yourself and by
kindling the spark of good by your free will, you made yourself a
eunuch, and acquired such a habit of virtue that impulse to vice became
almost an impossibility to you.  Therefore I praise this kind of
Eunuch-making also, and perhaps even above the others.  He that is able
to receive it let him receive it.  Choose which part you will; either
follow the Teacher or be your own teacher.  One thing alone is
shameful—that the passions be not extirpated.  It matters not how they
are extirpated.  The teacher is God’s creature; and you also have the
same origin; and whether the teacher grasp this grace, or the good be
your own—it is equally good.

<span id="iii.xx-p53"></span>XXII.  Only let us cut ourselves off from
passion, lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble us; <span
id="fr_3840"></span>[3841](#fn_3840.md) only let us follow the image; only
let us reverence our Archetype.  Cut off the bodily passions; cut off
also the spiritual.  For by how much the soul is more precious than the
body, by so much more precious is it to cleanse the soul than the body. 
And if cleansing of the body be a praiseworthy act, see, I pray you, how
much greater and higher is that of the soul.  Cut away the Arian
impiety; cut away the false opinion of Sabellius; do not join more than
is right, or wrongly sever; do not either confuse the Three Persons into
One, or make Three diversities of Nature.  The One is praiseworthy if
rightly understood; and the Three when rightly divided, when the
division is of Persons, not of Godhead.

<span id="iii.xx-p55"></span>XXIII.  I enact this for Laymen too, and I
enjoin it also upon all Priests, and upon those commissioned to rule. 
Come to the aid of the Word, all of you to whom God has given power to
aid.  It is a great thing to check murder, to punish adultery, to
chastise theft; much more to establish piety by law, and to bestow sound
doctrine.  My word will not be able to do as much in fighting for the
Holy Trinity as your Edict, if you will bridle the ill disposed, if you
will help the persecuted, if you will check the slayers, and prevent
people from being slain.  I am speaking not merely of bodily but of
spiritual slaughter.  For all sin is the death of the soul.  Here let my
discourse end.

<span id="iii.xx-p56"></span>XXIV.  But it remains that I speak a prayer
for those who are assembled.  Husbands alike and wives, rulers and
ruled, old men, and young men, and maidens, every sort of age, bear ye
every loss whether of money or of body, but one thing alone do not
endure—to lose the Godhead.  I adore the Father, I adore the Son, I
adore the Holy Ghost; or rather We adore them; I, who am speaking,
before all and after all and with all, in the same Christ our Lord, to
whom be the glory and the might for ever.  Amen.
