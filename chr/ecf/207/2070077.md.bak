<span id="iv.ii.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.ii.iv-p1.1"></span>Against Apollinarius; The Second Letter to
Cledonius.  (Ep. CII.)</span>

<span id="iv.ii.iv-p2"></span>Forasmuch as many persons have come to
your Reverence seeking confirmation of their faith, and therefore you
have affectionately asked me to put forth a brief definition and rule of
my opinion, I therefore write to your Reverence, what indeed you knew
before, that I never have and never can honour anything above the Nicene
Faith, that of the Holy Fathers who met there to destroy the Arian
heresy; but am, and by God’s help ever will be, of that faith;
completing in detail that which was incompletely said by them concerning
the Holy Ghost; for that question had not then been mooted, namely, that
we are to believe that the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are of one
Godhead, thus confessing the Spirit also to be God.  Receive then to
communion those who think and teach thus, as I also do; but those who
are otherwise minded refuse, and hold them as strangers to God and the
Catholic Church.  And since a question has also been mooted concerning
the Divine Assumption of humanity, or Incarnation, state this also
clearly to all concerning me, that I join in One the Son, who was
begotten of the Father, and afterward of the Virgin Mary, and that I do
not call Him two Sons, but worship Him as One and the same in undivided
Godhead and honour.  But if anyone does not assent to this statement,
either now or hereafter, he shall give account to God at the day of
judgment.

<span id="iv.ii.iv-p3"></span>Now, what we object and oppose to their
mindless opinion about His Mind is this, to put it shortly; for they are
almost alone in the condition which they lay down, as it is through want
of mind that they mutilate His mind.  But, that they may not accuse us
of having once accepted but of now repudiating the faith of their
beloved Vitalius <span id="fr_4722"></span>[4723](#fn_4722.md) which he
handed in in writing at the request of the blessed Bishop Damasus of
Rome, I will give a short explanation on this point also.  For these
men, when they are theologizing among their genuine disciples, and those
who are initiated into their secrets, like the Manichæans among those
whom they call the “Elect,” expose the full extent of their disease, and
scarcely allow flesh at all to the Saviour.  But when they are refuted
and pressed with the common answers about the Incarnation which the
Scripture presents, they confess indeed the orthodox words, but they do
violence to the sense; for they acknowledge the Manhood to be neither
without soul nor without reason nor without mind, nor imperfect, but
they bring in the Godhead to supply the soul and reason and mind, as
though It had mingled Itself only with His flesh, and not with the other
properties belonging to us men; although His sinlessness was far above
us, and was the cleansing of our passions.

<span id="iv.ii.iv-p5"></span>Thus, then, they interpret wrongly the
words, But we have the Mind of Christ, <span
id="fr_4723"></span>[4724](#fn_4723.md) and very absurdly, when they say
that His Godhead is the mind of Christ, and not understanding the
passage as we do, namely, that they who have purified their mind by the
imitation of the mind which the Saviour took of us, and, as far as may
be, have attained conformity with it, are said to have the mind of
Christ; just as they might be testified to have the flesh of Christ who
have trained their flesh, and in this respect have become of the same
body and partakers of Christ; and so he says “As we have borne the image
of the earth <span id="fr_4724"></span>[4725](#fn_4724.md) we shall also
bear the image of the heavenly.”  And so they declare that the Perfect
Man is not <span id="page_444">p. 444</span> <span
id="iv.ii.iv-Page_444"></span>He who was in all points tempted like as
we are yet without sin; <span id="fr_4725"></span>[4726](#fn_4725.md) but
the mixture of God and Flesh.  For what, say they, can be more perfect
than this?

<span id="iv.ii.iv-p9"></span>They play the same trick with the word
that describes the Incarnation, viz.:  He was made Man, explaining it to
mean, not, He was in the human nature with which He surrounded Himself,
according to the Scripture, He knew what was in man; <span
id="fr_4726"></span>[4727](#fn_4726.md) but teaching that it means, He
consorted and conversed with men, and taking refuge in the expression
which says that He was seen on Earth and conversed with Men. <span
id="fr_4727"></span>[4728](#fn_4727.md)   And what can anyone contend
further?  They who take away the Humanity and the Interior Image cleanse
by their newly invented mask only our outside, <span
id="fr_4728"></span>[4729](#fn_4728.md) and that which is seen; so far in
conflict with themselves that at one time, for the sake of the flesh,
they explain all the rest in a gross and carnal manner (for it is from
hence that they have derived their second Judaism and their silly
thousand years delight in paradise, and almost the idea that we shall
resume again the same conditions after these same thousand years); and
at another time they bring in His flesh as a phantom rather than a
reality, as not having been subjected to any of our experiences, not
even such as are free from sin; and use for this purpose the apostolic
expression, understood and spoken in a sense which is not apostolic,
that our Saviour was made in the likeness of Men and found in fashion as
a Man, <span id="fr_4729"></span>[4730](#fn_4729.md) as though by these
words was expressed, not the human form, but some delusive phantom and
appearance.

<span id="iv.ii.iv-p14"></span>Since then these expressions, rightly
understood, make for orthodoxy, but wrongly interpreted are heretical,
what is there to be surprised at if we received the words of Vitalius in
the more orthodox sense; our desire that they should be so meant
persuading us, though others are angry at the intention of his
writings?  This is, I think, the reason why Damasus himself, having been
subsequently better informed, and at the same time learning that they
hold by their former explanations, excommunicated them and overturned
their written confession of faith with an Anathema; as well as because
he was vexed at the deceit which he had suffered from them through
simplicity.

<span id="iv.ii.iv-p15"></span>Since, then, they have been openly
convicted of this, let them not be angry, but let them be ashamed of
themselves; and let them not slander us, but abase themselves and wipe
off from their portals that great and marvellous proclamation and boast
of their orthodoxy, meeting all who go in at once with the question and
distinction that we must worship, not a God-bearing Man, but a
flesh-bearing God.  What could be more unreasonable than this, though
these new heralds of truth think a great deal of the title?  For though
it has a certain sophistical grace through the quickness of its
antithesis, and a sort of juggling quackery grateful to the
uninstructed, yet it is the most absurd of absurdities and the most
foolish of follies.  For if one were to change the word *Man* or *Flesh*
into *God* (the first would please us, the second them), and then were
to use this wonderful antithesis, so divinely recognized, what
conclusion should we arrive at?  That we must worship, not a God-bearing
Flesh, but a Man-bearing God.  O monstrous absurdity!  They proclaim to
us to-day a wisdom hidden ever since the time of Christ—a thing worthy
of our tears.  For if the faith began thirty years ago, when nearly four
hundred years had passed since Christ was manifested, vain all that time
will have been our Gospel, and vain our faith; in vain will the Martyrs
have borne their witness, and in vain have so many and so great Prelates
presided over the people; and Grace is a matter of metres and not of the
faith.

<span id="iv.ii.iv-p16"></span>And who will not marvel at their
learning, in that on their own authority they divide the things of
Christ, and assign to His Manhood such sayings as He was born, He was
tempted, He was hungry, He was thirsty, He was wearied, He was asleep;
but reckon to His Divinity such as these:  He was glorified by Angels,
He overcame the Tempter, He fed the people in the wilderness, and He fed
them in such a manner, and He walked upon the sea; and say on the one
hand that the “Where have ye laid Lazarus?” <span
id="fr_4730"></span>[4731](#fn_4730.md) belongs to us, but the loud voice
“Lazarus, Come Forth” <span id="fr_4731"></span>[4732](#fn_4731.md) and the
raising him that had been four days dead, is above our nature; and that
while the “He was in an Agony, He was crucified, He was buried,” belongs
to the Veil, on the other hand, “He was confident, He rose again, He
ascended,” belong to the Inner Treasure; and then they accuse us of
introducing two natures, separate or conflicting, and of dividing the
supernatural and wondrous Union.  They ought, either not to do that of
which they accuse us, or not to accuse us of that which they do; so at
least if they are resolved to be consistent and not to propound at once
their own and their opponents’ principles.  Such is their want of
reason; it conflicts both with itself and with the <span
id="page_445">p. 445</span> <span id="iv.ii.iv-Page_445"></span>truth to
such an extent that they are neither conscious nor ashamed of it when
they fall out with themselves.  Now, if anyone thinks that we write all
this willingly and not upon compulsion, and that we are dissuading from
unity, and not doing our utmost to promote it, let him know that he is
very much mistaken, and has not made at all a good guess at our desires,
for nothing is or ever has been more valuable in our eyes than peace, as
the facts themselves prove; though their actions and brawlings against
us altogether exclude unanimity.

<span id="iv.ii.iv-p4"></span> Vitalius or Vitalis was one of the
principal followers of Apollinarius, and by him was consecrated
schismatical Bishop of Antioch, where, while yet orthodox, he had been
ordained a priest by Meletius.  But he quarrelled with his Bishop
through jealousy of another priest, and then fell under the influence of
Apollinarius.  He was summoned to Rome to clear himself of the charge of
heresy; and by a clever manipulation of language he produced a
confession which the Pope, Damasus, accepted as orthodox; but the Pope
remitted the whole case to Paulinus, who was at that time recognized by
the Western Church as rightful Bishop.  Vitalius, however, was unable to
accept the test required, and seceded.  On his return from Rome he had
visited Nazianzus, where S. Gregory received him as a brother in the
faith, though further acquaintance compelled him to withdraw from this
position.  Vitalius, while admitting that our Lord had both a human body
and a human soul, denied Him a human mind; whose place, according to his
teaching, was supplied by Divinity.
