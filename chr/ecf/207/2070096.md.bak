<span id="iv.iii.xvii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.iii.xvii-p1.1"></span>Ep. XLVII.  To Basil.</span>

<span id="iv.iii.xvii-p2"></span>(The division of the civil Province of
Cappadocia into two Provinces in the year 372 was followed by
ecclesiastical troubles.  Anthimus, the Bishop of Tyana, the civil
metropolis of the new division of Cappadocia Secunda, maintained that
the Ecclesiastical divisions must necessarily follow the civil, and by
consequence claimed for himself that the purely civil action of the
State had *ipso facto* elevated him to the dignity of Metropolitan of
the new Province; and this pretension was supported by the Bishops of
that district, who were as a rule not well disposed towards the great
Archbishop.  The next three letters are connected with this dispute.)

<span id="iv.iii.xvii-p3"></span>I hear that you are being troubled by
this fresh innovation, and are being worried by some sophistical and not
unusual officiousness on the part of those in power; and it is not to be
wondered at.  For I was not ignorant of their envy, or of the fact that
many of those <span id="page_453">p. 453</span> <span
id="iv.iii.xvii-Page_453"></span>around you are making use of you to
further their own interests, and are kindling the spark of meanness.  I
have no fear of seeing you unphilosophically affected by your troubles,
or in any way unworthy of yourself and me.  Nay, I think that it is now
above all that my Basil will be known, and that the philosophy which all
your life you have been collecting will shew itself, and will overcome
the abuse as with a high wave; and that you will remain unshaken while
others are being troubled.  If you think it well, I will come myself and
perhaps shall be able to give you some assistance by my counsel (if the
sea needs water, you do counsel!); but in any case I shall derive
benefit, and shall learn philosophy by bearing my part of the abuse.
