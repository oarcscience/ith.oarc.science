<span id="iii.xxvii"></span>

<span id="iii.xxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c21"><span
id="iii.xxvii-p1.1"></span>Oration XLV.</span>

<span id="iii.xxvii-p2"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="iii.xxvii-p2.1"></span>The Second Oration on Easter.</span>

<span id="iii.xxvii-p3"></span>*<span class="sc"><span
id="iii.xxvii-p3.1"></span>This</span>Oration was not, as its title
would perhaps lead us to suppose, delivered immediately after the first;
but an interval of many years elapsed between them, and the two have no
connection with each other.  Chronologically they are the first and last
of S. Gregory’s Sermons.  The Second was delivered in the Church of
Arianzus, a village near Nazianzus, where he had inherited some
property, to which he withdrew after resigning the Archbishopric of
Constantinople, and then, finding the administration even of the little
Bishopric of Nazianzus too much for his advancing years and declining
strength, he retired to Arianzus about the end of <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.xxvii-p3.2"></span>a.d.</span> 383, dying there in 389 or 390. 
“The exordium of this discourse is quite in the style of the Bible; the
Orator here describes and puts words into the mouth of the Angel of the
Resurrection.  His object is to show the importance of the day’s
solemnities, and to explain allegorically all the circumstances of the
ancient Passover, applying them to Christ and the Christian life.  Two
passages are borrowed verbatim from the discourse on the Nativity,
preached at Constantinople” (Benoît).*

<span id="iii.xxvii-p4"></span>The Benedictine Editors profess
themselves unable to determine whether this repetition is due to S.
Gregory himself—or to the carelessness of some amanuensis.

<span id="iii.xxvii-p5"></span>I.  <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.xxvii-p5.1"></span>I will</span> stand upon my watch, <span
id="fr_4586"></span>[4587](#fn_4586.md) saith the venerable Habakkuk; and I
will take my post beside him today on the authority and observation
which was given me of the Spirit; and I will look forth, and will
observe what shall be said to me.  Well, I have taken my stand, and
looked forth; and behold a man riding on the clouds and he is very high,
and his countenance is as the countenance of Angel, <span
id="fr_4587"></span>[4588](#fn_4587.md) and his vesture as the brightness
of piercing lightning; and he lifts his hand toward the East, and cries
with a loud voice.  His voice is like the voice of a trumpet; and round
about Him is as it were a multitude of the Heavenly Host; and he saith,
Today is salvation come unto the world, to that which <span
id="page_423">p. 423</span> <span id="iii.xxvii-Page_423"></span>is
visible, and to that which is invisible.  Christ is risen from the dead,
rise ye with Him.  Christ is returned again to Himself, return ye. 
Christ is freed from the tomb, be ye freed from the bond of sin.  The
gates of hell are opened, and death is destroyed, and the old Adam is
put aside, and the New is fulfilled; if any man be in Christ he is a new
creature; <span id="fr_4588"></span>[4589](#fn_4588.md) be ye renewed. 
Thus he speaks; and the rest sing out, as they did before when Christ
was manifested to us by His birth on earth, their glory to God in the
highest, on earth, peace, goodwill among men. <span
id="fr_4589"></span>[4590](#fn_4589.md)   And with them I also utter the
same words among you.  And would that I might receive a voice that
should rank with the Angel’s, and should sound through all the ends of
the earth.

<span id="iii.xxvii-p10"></span>II.  The Lord’s Passover, the Passover,
and again I say the Passover to the honour of the Trinity.  This is to
us a Feast of feasts and a Solemnity of solemnities <span
id="fr_4590"></span>[4591](#fn_4590.md) as far exalted above all others
(not only those which are merely human and creep on the ground, but even
those which are of Christ Himself, and are celebrated in His honour) as
the Sun is above the stars.  Beautiful indeed yesterday was our splendid
array, and our illumination, in which both in public and private we
associated ourselves, every kind of men, and almost every rank,
illuminating the night with our crowded fires, formed after the fashion
of that great light, both that with which the heaven above us lights its
beacon fires, and that which is above the heavens, amid the angels (the
first luminous nature, next to the first nature of all, because
springing directly from it), and that which is in the Trinity, from
which all light derives its being, parted from the undivided light and
honoured.  But today’s is more beautiful and more illustrious; inasmuch
as yesterday’s light was a forerunner of the rising of the Great Light,
and as it were a kind of rejoicing in preparation for the Festival; but
today we are celebrating the Resurrection itself, no longer as an object
of expectation, but as having already come to pass, and gathering the
whole world unto itself.  Let then different persons bring forth
different fruits and offer different offerings at this season, smaller
or greater…such spiritual offerings as are dear to God…as each may have
power.  For scarcely Angels themselves could offer gifts worthy of its
rank, those first and intellectual and pure beings, who are also
eye-witnesses of the Glory That is on high; if even these can attain the
full strain of praise.  We will for our part offer a discourse, the best
and most precious thing we have—especially as we are praising the Word
for the blessing which He hath bestowed on the reasoning creation.  I
will begin from this point.  For I cannot endure, when I am engaged in
offering the sacrifice of the lips concerning the Great Sacrifice and
the greatest of days, to fail to recur to God, and to take my beginning
from Him.  Therefore I pray you, cleanse your mind and ears and
thoughts, all you who delight in such subjects, since the discourse will
be concerning God, and will be divine; that you may depart filled with
delights of a sort that do not pass away into nothingness.  And it shall
be at once very full and very concise, so as neither to distress you by
its deficiencies, nor to displease you by satiety.

<span id="iii.xxvii-p12"></span>III.  God <span
id="fr_4591"></span>[4592](#fn_4591.md) always was and always is, and
always will be; or rather, God always Is. <span
id="fr_4592"></span>[4593](#fn_4592.md)   For Was and Will Be are fragments
of our time, and of changeable nature.  But He is Eternal Being; and
this is the Name He gives Himself when giving the Oracles to Moses in
the Mount.  For in Himself He sums up and contains all Being, having
neither beginning in the past nor end in the future…like some great Sea
of Being, limitless and unbounded, transcending all conception of time
and nature, only adumbrated by the mind, and that very dimly and
scantily…not by His Essentials but by His Environment, <span
id="fr_4593"></span>[4594](#fn_4593.md) one image being got from one source
and another from another, and combined into some sort of presentation of
the truth, which escapes us before we have caught it, and which takes to
flight before we have conceived it, blazing forth upon our master-part,
even when that is cleansed, as the lightning flash which will not stay
its <span id="page_424">p. 424</span> <span
id="iii.xxvii-Page_424"></span>course does upon our sight…in order, as I
conceive, by that part of it which we can comprehend to draw us to
itself (for that which is altogether incomprehensible is outside the
bounds of hope, and not within the compass of endeavour); and by that
part of It which we cannot comprehend to move our wonder; and as an
object of wonder to become more an object of desire; and being desired,
to purify; and purifying to make us like God; so that, when we have
become like Himself, God may, to use a bold expression, hold converse
with us as God; being united to us, and known by us; and that perhaps to
the same extent as He already knows those who are known to Him. <span
id="fr_4594"></span>[4595](#fn_4594.md)   The Divine Nature, then, is
boundless and hard to understand, and all that we can comprehend of Him
is His boundlessness; even though one may conceive that because He is of
a simple Nature He is therefore either wholly incomprehensible or
perfectly comprehensible.  For let us farther enquire what is implied by
“is of a simple Nature?”  For it is quite certain that this simplicity
is not itself its nature, just as composition is not by itself the
essence of compound beings.

<span id="iii.xxvii-p17"></span>IV.  And when Infinity is considered
from two points of view, beginning and end (for that which is beyond
these and not limited by them is Infinity), when the mind looks into the
depths above, not having where to stand, and leans upon phænomena to
form an idea of God it calls the Infinite and Unapproachable which it
finds there by the name of Unoriginate.  And when it looks into the
depth below and at the future, it calls Him Undying and Imperishable. 
And when it draws a conclusion from the whole, it calls Him Eternal. 
For Eternity is neither time nor part of time; for it cannot be
measured.  But what time measured by the course of the sun is to us,
that Eternity is to the Everlasting; namely a sort of timelike movement
and interval, coextensive with Their Existence.  This however is all
that I must now say of God; for the present is not a suitable time, as
my present subject is not the doctrine of God, but that of the
Incarnation.  And when I say God, I mean Father, Son, and Holy Ghost;
for Godhead is neither diffused beyond These, so as to introduce a mob
of gods, nor yet bounded by a smaller compass than These, so as to
condemn us for a poverty stricken conception of Deity, either Judaizing
to save the Monarchia, or falling into heathenism by the multitude of
our gods.  For the evil on either side is the same, though found in
contrary directions.  Thus then is the Holy of Holies, Which is hidden
even from the Seraphim, and is glorified with a thrice-repeated Holy
meeting in one ascription of the title Lord and God, as one of our
predecessors has most beautifully and loftily reasoned out.

<span id="iii.xxvii-p18"></span>V.  But since this movement of
Self-contemplation alone could not satisfy Goodness, but Good must be
poured out and go forth beyond Itself, to multiply the objects of Its
beneficence (for this was essential to the highest Goodness), He first
conceived the Angelic and Heavenly Powers.  And this conception was a
work fulfilled by His Word and perfected by His Spirit.  And so the
Secondary Splendours came into being, as the ministers of the Primary
Splendour (whether we are to conceive of them as intelligent Spirits, or
as Fire of an immaterial and incorporeal kind, or as some other nature
approaching this as near as may be).  I should like to say that they are
incapable of movement in the direction of evil, and susceptible only of
the movement of good, as being about God and illuminated with the first
Rays from God (for earthly beings have but the second illumination), but
I am obliged to stop short of saying that they are immovable, and to
conceive and speak of them as only difficult to move, because of him who
for His Splendour was called Lucifer, but became and is called Darkness
through his pride; and the Apostate Hosts who are subject to him,
creators of evil by their revolt against good, and our inciters.

<span id="iii.xxvii-p19"></span>VI.  Thus then and for these reasons, He
gave being to the world of thought, as far as I can reason on these
matters, and estimate great things in my own poor language.  Then, when
His first Creation was in good order, He conceives a second world,
material and visible; and this a system of earth and sky and all that is
in the midst of them; an admirable creation indeed when we look at the
fair form of every part, but yet more worthy of admiration when we
consider the harmony and unison of the whole, and how each part fits in
with every other in fair order, and all with the whole, tending to the
perfect completion of the world as a Unit.  This was to shew that He
could call into being not only a nature akin to Himself, but also one
altogether alien to Him.  For akin to Deity are those natures which are
intellectual, and only to be comprehended by mind; but all of which
sense can take cognizance are utterly alien to It; <span
id="page_425">p. 425</span> <span id="iii.xxvii-Page_425"></span>and of
these the furthest removed from it are all those which are entirely
destitute of soul and power of motion.

<span id="iii.xxvii-p20"></span>VII.  Mind then and sense, thus
distinguished from each other, had remained within their own boundaries,
and bore in themselves the magnificence of the Creator-Word, silent
praisers and thrilling heralds of His mighty work.  Not yet was there
any mingling of both, nor any mixture of these opposites, tokens of a
greater wisdom and generosity in the creation of natures; nor as yet
were the whole riches of goodness made known.  Now the Creator-Word,
determining to exhibit this, and to produce a single living being out of
both (the invisible and the visible creation, I mean) fashions Man; and
taking a body from already existing matter, and placing in it a Breath
taken from Himself (which the Word knew to be an intelligent soul, and
the image of God), as a sort of second world, great in littleness, He
placed him on the earth, a new Angel, a mingled worshipper, fully
initiated into the visible creation, but only partially into the
intellectual; king of all upon earth, but subject to the King above;
earthly and heavenly; temporal and yet immortal; visible and yet
intellectual; halfway between greatness and lowliness; in one person
combining spirit and flesh; spirit because of the favour bestowed on
him, flesh on account of the height to which he had been raised; the one
that he might continue to live and glorify his benefactor, the other
that he might suffer, and by suffering be put in remembrance, and be
corrected if he became proud in his greatness; a living creature,
trained here and then moved elsewhere; and to complete the mystery,
deified by its inclination to God…for to this, I think, tends that light
of Truth which here we possess but in measure; that we should both see
and experience the Splendour of God, which is worthy of Him Who made us,
and will dissolve us, and remake us after a loftier fashion.

<span id="iii.xxvii-p21"></span>VIII.  This being He placed in
paradise—whatever that paradise may have been (having honoured him with
the gift of free will, in order that good might belong to him as the
result of his choice, no less than to Him Who had implanted the seeds of
it)—to till the immortal plants, by which is perhaps meant the Divine
conceptions, both the simpler and the more perfect; naked in his
simplicity and inartificial life; and without any covering or screen;
for it was fitting that he who was from the beginning should be such. 
And He gave Him a Law, as material for his free will to act upon.  This
Law was a commandment as to what plants he might partake of, and which
one he might not touch.  This latter was the Tree of Knowledge; not,
however, because it was evil from the beginning when planted; nor was it
forbidden because God grudged it to men—let not the enemies of God wag
their tongues in that direction, or imitate the serpent.  But it would
have been good if partaken of at the proper time; for the Tree was,
according to my theory, Contemplation, which it is only safe for those
who have reached maturity of habit to enter upon; but which is not good
for those who are still somewhat simple and greedy; just as neither is
solid food good for those who are yet tender and have need of milk.  But
when through the devil’s malice and the woman’s caprice, <span
id="fr_4595"></span>[4596](#fn_4595.md) to which she succumbed as the more
tender, and which she brought to bear upon the man, as she was the more
apt to persuade—alas for my weakness, for that of my first father was
mine; he forgot the commandment which had been given him, and yielded to
the baleful fruit; and for his sin was banished at once from the tree of
life, and from paradise, and from God; and put on the coats of skins,
that is, perhaps, the coarser flesh, both mortal and contradictory.  And
this was the first thing which he learnt—his own shame—and he hid
himself from God.  Yet here too he makes a gain, namely death and the
cutting off of sin, in order that evil may not be immortal.  Thus, his
punishment is changed into a mercy, for it is in mercy, I am persuaded,
that God inflicts punishment.

<span id="iii.xxvii-p23"></span>IX.  And having first been chastened by
many means because his sins were many, whose root of evil sprang up
through divers causes and sundry times, by word, by law, by prophets, by
benefits, by threats, by plagues, by waters, by fires, by wars, by
victories, by defeats, by signs in heaven, and signs in the air, and in
the earth, and in the sea; by unexpected changes of men, of cities, of
nations (the object of which was the destruction of wickedness) at last
he needed a stronger remedy, for his diseases were growing worse; mutual
slaughters, adulteries, perjuries, unnatural crimes, and that first and
last of all evils, idolatry, and the transfer of worship from the
Creator to the creatures.  As these required a greater aid, so they also
obtained a greater.  And that was that the Word of God Himself, Who is
before all worlds, the Invisible, the Incomprehensible, the Bodiless,
the Begin<span id="page_426">p. 426</span> <span
id="iii.xxvii-Page_426"></span>ning of beginning, the Light of Light,
the Source of Life and Immortality, the Image of the Archetype, the
Immovable Seal, the Unchangeable Image, the Father’s Definition and
Word, came to His own Image, and took on Him Flesh for the sake of our
flesh, and mingled Himself with an intelligent soul for my soul’s sake,
purifying like by like; and in all points except sin was made Man;
conceived by the Virgin, who first in body and soul was purified by the
Holy Ghost, for it was needful both That Child-bearing should be
honoured and that Virginity should receive a higher honour.  He came
forth then, as God, with That which He had assumed; one Person in two
natures, flesh and Spirit, of which the latter deified the former.  O
new commingling; O strange conjunction! the Self-existent comes into
Being, the Uncreated is created, That which cannot be contained is
contained by the intervention of an intellectual soul mediating between
the Deity and the corporeity of the flesh.  And He who gives riches
becomes poor; for He assumes the poverty of my flesh, that I may assume
the riches of His Godhead.  He that is full empties Himself; for He
empties Himself of His Glory for a short while, that I may have a share
in His Fulness.  What is the riches of His Goodness?  What is this
mystery that is around me?  I had a share in the Image and I did not
keep it; He partakes of my flesh that He may both save the Image and
make the flesh immortal.  He communicates a Second Communion, far more
marvellous than the first, inasmuch as then He imparted the better
nature, but now He Himself assumes the worse.  This is more godlike than
the former action; this is loftier in the eyes of all men of
understanding.

<span id="iii.xxvii-p24"></span>X.  But perhaps some one of those who
are too impetuous and festive may say, “What has all this to do with
us?  Spur on your horse to the goal; talk to us about the Festival and
the reasons for our being here to-day.”  Yes, this is what I am about to
do, although I have begun at a somewhat previous point, being compelled
to do so by the needs of my argument.  There will be no harm in the eyes
of scholars and lovers of the beautiful if we say a few words about the
word Pascha itself, for such an addition will not be useless in their
ears.  This great and venerable Pascha is called Phaska by the Hebrews
in their own language; and the word means Passing Over.  Historically,
from their flight and migration from Egypt into the Land of Canaan;
spiritually, from the progress and ascent from things below to things
above and to the Land of Promise.  And we observe that a thing which we
often find to have happened in Scripture, the change of certain nouns
from an uncertain to a clearer sense, or from a coarser to a more
refined, has taken place in this instance.  For some people, supposing
this to be a name of the Sacred Passion, and in consequence Grecizing
the word by changing Phi and Kappa into Pi and Chi, called the Day
Pascha. <span id="fr_4596"></span>[4597](#fn_4596.md)   And custom took it
up and confirmed the word, with the help of the ears of most people, to
whom it had a more pious sound.

<span id="iii.xxvii-p26"></span>XI.  But before our time the Holy
Apostle declared that the Law was but a shadow of things to come, <span
id="fr_4597"></span>[4598](#fn_4597.md) which are conceived by thought. 
And God too, who in still older times gave oracles to Moses, said when
giving laws concerning these things, See thou make all things according
to the pattern shewed thee in the Mount, <span
id="fr_4598"></span>[4599](#fn_4598.md) when He shewed him the visible
things as an adumbration of and design for the things that are
invisible.  And I am persuaded that none of these things has been
ordered in vain, none without a reason, none in a grovelling manner or
unworthy of the legislation of God and the ministry of Moses, even
though it be difficult in each type to find a theory descending to the
most delicate details, to every point about the Tabernacle itself, and
its measures and materials, and the Levites and Priests who carried
them, and all the particulars which were enacted about the Sacrifices
and the purifications and the Offerings; <span
id="fr_4599"></span>[4600](#fn_4599.md) and though these are only to be
understood by those who rank with Moses in virtue, or have made the
nearest approach to his learning.  For in that Mount itself God is seen
by men; on the one hand through His own descent from His lofty abode, on
the other through His drawing us up from our abasement on earth, that
the Incomprehensible may be in some degree, and as far as is safe,
comprehended by a mortal nature.  For in no other way is it possible for
the denseness of a material body and an <span id="page_427">p.
427</span> <span id="iii.xxvii-Page_427"></span>imprisoned mind to come
into consciousness of God, except by His assistance.  Then therefore all
men do not seem to have been deemed worthy of the same rank and
position; but one of one place and one of another, each, I think,
according to the measure of his own purification.  Some have even been
altogether driven away, and only permitted to hear the Voice from on
high, namely those whose dispositions are altogether like wild beasts,
and who are unworthy of divine mysteries.

<span id="iii.xxvii-p30"></span>XII.  But we, standing midway between
those whose minds are utterly dense on the one side, and on the other
those who are very contemplative and exalted, that we may neither remain
quite idle and immovable, nor yet be more busy than we ought, and fall
short of and be estranged from our purpose—for the former course is
Jewish and very low, and the latter is only fit for the
dream-soothsayer, and both alike are to be condemned—let us say our say
upon these matters, so far as is within our reach, and not very absurd,
or exposed to the ridicule of the multitude.  Our belief is that since
it was needful that we, who had fallen in consequence of the original
sin, and had been led away by pleasure, even as far as idolatry and
unlawful bloodshed, should be recalled and raised up again to our
original position through the tender mercy of God our Father, Who could
not endure that such a noble work of His own hands as Man should be lost
to Him; the method of our new creation, and of what should be done, was
this:—that all violent remedies were disapproved, as not likely to
persuade us, and as quite possibly tending to add to the plague, through
our chronic pride; but that God disposed things to our restoration by a
gentle and kindly method of cure.  For a crooked sapling will not bear a
sudden bending the other way, or violence from the hand that would
straighten it, but will be more quickly broken than straightened; and a
horse of a hot temper and above a certain age will not endure the
tyranny of the bit without some coaxing and encouragement.  Therefore
the Law is given to us as an assistance, like a boundary wall between
God and idols, drawing us away from one and to the Other.  And it
concedes a little at first, that it may receive that which is greater. 
It concedes the Sacrifices for a time, that it may establish God in us,
and then when the fitting time shall come may abolish the Sacrifices
also; thus wisely changing our minds by gradual removals, and bringing
us over to the Gospel when we have already been trained to a prompt
obedience.

<span id="iii.xxvii-p31"></span>XIII.  Thus then and for this cause the
written Law came in, gathering us into Christ; and this is the account
of the Sacrifices as I account for them.  And that you may not be
ignorant of the depth of His Wisdom and the riches of His unsearchable
judgments, <span id="fr_4600"></span>[4601](#fn_4600.md) He did not leave
even these unhallowed altogether, or useless, or with nothing in them
but mere blood. <span id="fr_4601"></span>[4602](#fn_4601.md)   But that
great, and if I may say so, in Its first nature unsacrificeable Victim,
was intermingled with the Sacrifices of the Law, and was a purification,
not for a part of the world, nor for a short time, but for the whole
world and for all time.  For this reason a Lamb was chosen for its
innocence, and its clothing of the original nakedness.  For such is the
Victim, That was offered for us, Who is both in Name and fact the
Garment of incorruption.  And He was a perfect Victim not only on
account of His Godhead, than which nothing is more perfect; but also on
account of that which He assumed having been anointed with Deity, and
having become one with That which anointed It, and I am bold to say,
made equal with God.  A Male, because offered for Adam; or rather the
Stronger for the strong, when the first Man had fallen under sin; and
chiefly because there is in Him nothing feminine, nothing unmanly; but
He burst from the bonds of the Virgin-Mother’s womb with much power, and
a Male was brought forth by the Prophetess, <span
id="fr_4602"></span>[4603](#fn_4602.md) as Isaiah declares the good
tidings.  And of a year old, because He is the Sun of
Righteousness <span id="fr_4603"></span>[4604](#fn_4603.md) setting out
from heaven, and circumscribed by His visible Nature, and returning unto
Himself. <span id="fr_4604"></span>[4605](#fn_4604.md)   And “The blessed
crown of Goodness,”—being on every side equal to Himself and alike; and
not only this, but also as giving life to all the circle of the virtues,
gently commingled and intermixed with each other, according to the Law
of Love and Order. <span id="fr_4605"></span>[4606](#fn_4605.md)   And
Immaculate and <span id="page_428">p. 428</span> <span
id="iii.xxvii-Page_428"></span>guileless, as being the Healer of faults,
and of the defects and taints that come from sin.  For though He both
took on Him our sins and bare our diseases, <span
id="fr_4606"></span>[4607](#fn_4606.md) yet He did not Himself suffer aught
that needed healing.  For He was tempted in all points like as we are
yet without sin. <span id="fr_4607"></span>[4608](#fn_4607.md)   For he
that persecuted the Light that shineth in darkness could not overtake
Him.

<span id="iii.xxvii-p40"></span>XIV.  What more?  The First Month is
introduced, or rather the beginning of months, whether it was so among
the Hebrews from the beginning, or was made so later on this account,
and became the first in consequence of the Mystery; and the tenth of the
Month, for this is the most complete number, of units the first perfect
unit, and the parent of perfection.  And it is kept until the fifth day,
perhaps because the Victim, of Whom I am speaking, purifies the five
senses, from which comes falling into sin, and around which the war
rages, inasmuch as they are open to the incitements to sin.  And it was
chosen, not only out of the lambs, but also out of the inferior species,
which are placed on the left hand <span
id="fr_4608"></span>[4609](#fn_4608.md) —the kids; because He is sacrificed
not only for the righteous, but also for sinners; and perhaps even more
for these, inasmuch as we have greater need of His mercy.  And we need
not be surprised that a lamb for a house should be required as the best
course, but if that could not be, then one might be obtained by
contributions (owing to poverty) for the houses of a family; because it
is clearly best that each individual should suffice for his own
perfecting, and should offer his own living sacrifice holy unto God Who
called him, being consecrated at all times and in every respect.  But if
that cannot be, then that those who are akin in virtue and of like
disposition should be made use of as helpers.  For I think this
provision means that we should communicate of the Sacrifice to those who
are nearest, if there be need.

<span id="iii.xxvii-p42"></span>XV.  Then comes the Sacred Night, the
Anniversary of the confused darkness of the present life, into which the
primæval darkness is dissolved, and all things come into life and rank
and form, and that which was chaos is reduced to order.  Then we flee
from Egypt, that is from sullen persecuting sin; and from Pharaoh the
unseen tyrant, and the bitter taskmasters, changing our quarters to the
world above; and are delivered from the clay and the brickmaking, and
from the husks and dangers of this fleshly condition, which for most men
is only not overpowered by mere husklike calculations.  Then the Lamb is
slain, and act and word are sealed with the Precious Blood; that is,
habit and action, the sideposts of our doors; I mean, of course, of the
movements of mind and opinion, which are rightly opened and closed by
contemplation, since there is a limit even to thoughts.  Then the last
and gravest plague upon the persecutors, truly worthy of the night; and
Egypt mourns the first-born of her own reasonings and actions which are
also called in the Scripture the Seed of the Chaldeans <span
id="fr_4609"></span>[4610](#fn_4609.md) removed, and the children of
Babylon dashed against the rocks and destroyed; <span
id="fr_4610"></span>[4611](#fn_4610.md) and the whole air is full of the
cry and clamour of the Egyptians; and then the Destroyer of them shall
withdraw from us in reverence of the Unction.  Then the removal of
leaven; that is, of the old and sour wickedness, not of that which is
quickening and makes bread; for seven days, a number which is of all the
most mystical, <span id="fr_4611"></span>[4612](#fn_4611.md) and is
co-ordinate with this present world, that we may not lay in provision of
any Egyptian dough, or relic of Pharisaic or ungodly teaching.

<span id="iii.xxvii-p46"></span>XVI.  Well, let them lament; we will
feed on the Lamb toward evening—for Christ’s Passion was in the
completion of the ages; because too He communicated His Disciples in the
evening with His Sacrament, destroying the darkness of sin; and not
sodden, but roast—that our word may have in it nothing that is
unconsidered or watery, or easily made away with; but may be entirely
consistent and solid, and free from all that is impure and from all
vanity.  And let us be aided by the good coals, <span
id="fr_4612"></span>[4613](#fn_4612.md) kindling and purifying our minds
from Him <span id="page_429">p. 429</span> <span
id="iii.xxvii-Page_429"></span>That cometh to send fire on the
earth, <span id="fr_4613"></span>[4614](#fn_4613.md) that shall destroy all
evil habits, and to hasten its kindling.  Whatsoever then there be, of
solid and nourishing in the Word, shall be eaten with the inward parts
and hidden things of the mind, and shall be consumed and given up to
spiritual digestion; aye, from head to foot, that is, from the first
contemplations of Godhead to the very last thoughts about the
Incarnation.  Neither let us carry aught of it abroad, nor leave it till
the morning; because most of our Mysteries may not be carried out to
them that are outside, nor is there beyond this night any further
purification; and procrastination is not creditable to those who have a
share in the Word.  For just as it is good and well-pleasing to God not
to let anger last through the day, <span
id="fr_4614"></span>[4615](#fn_4614.md) but to get rid of it before sunset,
whether you take this of time or in a mystical sense, for it is not safe
for us that the Sun of Righteousness should go down upon our wrath; so
too we ought not to let such Food remain all night, nor to put it off
till to-morrow.  But whatever is of bony nature and not fit for food and
hard for us even to understand, this must not be broken; that is, badly
divined and misconceived (I need not say that in the history not a bone
of Jesus was broken, even though His death was hastened by His
crucifiers on account of the Sabbath); <span
id="fr_4615"></span>[4616](#fn_4615.md) nor must it be stripped off and
thrown away, lest that which is holy should be given to the dogs, <span
id="fr_4616"></span>[4617](#fn_4616.md) that is, to the evil hearers of the
Word; just as the glorious pearl of the Word is not to be cast before
swine; but it shall be consumed with the fire with which the burnt
offerings also are consumed, being refined and preserved by the Spirit
That searcheth and knoweth all things, not destroyed in the waters, nor
scattered abroad as the calf’s head which was hastily made by Israel was
by Moses, <span id="fr_4617"></span>[4618](#fn_4617.md) for a reproach for
their hardness of heart.

<span id="iii.xxvii-p53"></span>XVII.  Nor would it be right for us to
pass over the manner of this eating either, for the Law does not do so,
but carries its mystical labour even to this point in the literal
enactment.  Let us consume the Victim in haste, eating It with
unleavened bread, with bitter herbs, and with our loins girded, and our
shoes on our feet, and leaning on staves like old men; with haste, that
we fall not into that fault which was forbidden to Lot <span
id="fr_4618"></span>[4619](#fn_4618.md) by the commandment, that we look
not around, nor stay in all that neighbourhood, but that we escape to
the mountain, that we be not overtaken by the strange fire of Sodom, nor
be congealed into a pillar of salt in consequence of our turning back to
wickedness; for this is the result of delay.  *With bitter herbs*, for a
life according to the Will of God is bitter and arduous, especially to
beginners, and higher than pleasures.  For although the new yoke is easy
and the burden light, <span id="fr_4619"></span>[4620](#fn_4619.md) as you
are told, yet this is on account of the hope and the reward, which is
far more abundant than the hardships of this life.  If it were not so,
who would not say that the Gospel is more full of toil and trouble than
the enactments of the Law?  For, while the Law prohibits only the
completed acts of sin, we are condemned for the causes also, almost as
if they were acts.  The Law says, *Thou shalt not commit adultery*; but
*you* may not even *desire*, kindling passion by curious and earnest
looks.  *Thou shalt not kill*, says the Law; but you are not even to
return a blow, but on the contrary are to offer yourself to the smiter. 
How much more ascetic is the Gospel than the Law!  *Thou shalt not
forswear thyself* is the Law; but *you* are not to swear at all, either
a greater or a lesser oath, for an oath is the parent of perjury*.  Thou
shalt not join house to house, nor field to field, oppressing the
poor*; <span id="fr_4620"></span>[4621](#fn_4620.md) but you are to set
aside willingly even your just possessions, and to be stripped for the
poor, that without encumbrance you may take up the Cross <span
id="fr_4621"></span>[4622](#fn_4621.md) and be enriched with the unseen
riches.

<span id="iii.xxvii-p58"></span>XVIII.  And let the loins of the
unreasoning animals be unbound and loose, for they have not the gift of
reason which can overcome pleasure (it is not needful to say that even
they know the limit of natural movement).  But let that part of your
being which is the seat of passion, and which neighs, <span
id="fr_4622"></span>[4623](#fn_4622.md) as Holy Scripture calls it, when
sweeping away this shameful passion, be restrained by a girdle of
continence, so that you may eat the Passover purely, having mortified
your members which are upon the earth, <span
id="fr_4623"></span>[4624](#fn_4623.md) and copying the girdle <span
id="fr_4624"></span>[4625](#fn_4624.md) of John, the Hermit and Forerunner
and great Herald of the Truth.  Another girdle I know, the soldierly and
manly one, I mean, from which the Euzoni of Syria and certain
Monozoni <span id="fr_4625"></span>[4626](#fn_4625.md) take their name. 
And it is in respect of this too that God saith in an oracle to Job,
“Nay, but gird up thy loins like a <span id="page_430">p. 430</span>
<span id="iii.xxvii-Page_430"></span>man, and give a manly
answer.” <span id="fr_4626"></span>[4627](#fn_4626.md)   With this also
holy David boasts that he is girded with strength from God, <span
id="fr_4627"></span>[4628](#fn_4627.md) and speaks of God Himself as
clothed with strength <span id="fr_4628"></span>[4629](#fn_4628.md) and
girded about with power—against the ungodly of course—though perhaps
some may prefer to see in this a declaration of the abundance of His
power, and, as it were, its restraint, just as also He clothes Himself
with Light as with a garment. <span id="fr_4629"></span>[4630](#fn_4629.md)
  For who shall endure His unrestrained power and light?  Do I enquire
what there is common to the loins and to truth?  What then is the
meaning to S. Paul of the expression, “Stand, therefore, having your
loins girt about with truth?” <span id="fr_4630"></span>[4631](#fn_4630.md)
  Is it perhaps that contemplation is to restrain concupiscence, and not
to allow it to be carried in another direction?  For that which is
disposed to love in a particular direction will not have the same power
towards other pleasures.

<span id="iii.xxvii-p68"></span>XIX.  And as to *shoes*, let him who is
about to touch the Holy Land which the feet of God have trodden, put
them off, as Moses did upon the Mount, <span
id="fr_4631"></span>[4632](#fn_4631.md) that he may bring there nothing
dead; nothing to come between Man and God.  So too if any disciple is
sent to preach the Gospel, let him go in a spirit of philosophy and
without excess, inasmuch as he must, besides being without money and
without staff and with but one coat, also be barefooted, <span
id="fr_4632"></span>[4633](#fn_4632.md) that the feet of those who preach
the Gospel of Peace and every other good may appear beautiful. <span
id="fr_4633"></span>[4634](#fn_4633.md)   But he who would flee from Egypt
and the things of Egypt must put on shoes for safety’s sake, especially
in regard to the scorpions and snakes in which Egypt so abounds, so as
not to be injured by those which watch the heel <span
id="fr_4634"></span>[4635](#fn_4634.md) which also we are bidden to tread
under foot. <span id="fr_4635"></span>[4636](#fn_4635.md)   And concerning
*the staff* and the signification of it, my belief is as follows.  There
is one I know to lean upon, and another which belongs to Pastors and
Teachers, and which corrects human sheep.  Now the Law prescribes to you
the staff to lean upon, that you may not break down in your mind when
you hear of God’s Blood, and His Passion, and His death; and that you
may not be carried away to heresy in your defence of God; but without
shame and without doubt may eat the Flesh and drink the Blood, if you
are desirous of true life, neither disbelieving His words about His
Flesh, nor offended at those about His Passion.  Lean upon this, and
stand firm and strong, in nothing shaken by the adversaries nor carried
away by the plausibility of their arguments.  Stand upon thy High Place;
in the Courts of Jerusalem <span id="fr_4636"></span>[4637](#fn_4636.md)
place thy feet; lean upon the Rock, that thy steps in God be not shaken.

<span id="iii.xxvii-p75"></span>XX.  What sayest thou?  Thus it hath
pleased Him that thou shouldest come forth <span
id="fr_4637"></span>[4638](#fn_4637.md) out of Egypt, the iron furnace;
that thou shouldest leave behind the idolatry of that country, and be
led by Moses and his lawgiving and martial rule.  I give thee a piece of
advice which is not my own, or rather which is very much my own, if thou
consider the matter spiritually.  Borrow from the Egyptians vessels of
gold and silver; <span id="fr_4638"></span>[4639](#fn_4638.md) with these
take thy journey; supply thyself for the road with the goods of
strangers, or rather with thine own.  There is money owing to thee, the
wages of thy bondage and of thy brickmaking; be clever on thy side too
in asking retribution; be an honest robber.  Thou didst suffer wrong
there whilst thou wast fighting with the clay (that is, this troublesome
and filthy body) and wast building cities foreign and unsafe, whose
memorial perishes with a cry. <span id="fr_4639"></span>[4640](#fn_4639.md)
  What then?  Dost thou come out for nothing and without wages?  But why
wilt thou leave to the Egyptians and to the powers of thine adversaries
that which they have gained by wickedness, and will spend with yet
greater wickedness?  It does not belong to them:  they have ravished it,
and have sacrilegiously taken it as plunder from Him who saith, The
silver is Mine and the gold is Mine, <span
id="fr_4640"></span>[4641](#fn_4640.md) and I give it to whom I will. 
Yesterday it was theirs, for it was permitted to be so; to-day the
Master takes it and gives it to thee, <span
id="fr_4641"></span>[4642](#fn_4641.md) that thou mayest make a good and
saving use of it.  Let us make to ourselves friends of the Mammon of
unrighteousness, <span id="fr_4642"></span>[4643](#fn_4642.md) that when we
fail, they may receive us in the time of judgment.

<span id="iii.xxvii-p82"></span>XXI.  If you are a Rachel or a Leah, a
patriarchal and great soul, steal whatever idols of your father you can
find; <span id="fr_4643"></span>[4644](#fn_4643.md) not, however, that you
may keep them, but that you may destroy them; and if you are a wise
Israelite remove them to the Land of the Promise, and let the persecutor
grieve over the loss of them, and learn through being outwitted that it
was vain for him to tyrannize over and keep in bondage better men than
himself.  If thou doest this, and comest out of Egypt thus, I know well
that thou shalt be guided by the pillar of fire and cloud by night and
day. <span id="fr_4644"></span>[4645](#fn_4644.md)   The wilderness shall
be tamed for thee, and the Sea divided; <span
id="fr_4645"></span>[4646](#fn_4645.md) <span id="page_431">p. 431</span>
<span id="iii.xxvii-Page_431"></span>Pharaoh shall be drowned; <span
id="fr_4646"></span>[4647](#fn_4646.md) bread shall be rained down: <span
id="fr_4647"></span>[4648](#fn_4647.md)   the rock shall become a
fountain; <span id="fr_4648"></span>[4649](#fn_4648.md) Amalek shall be
conquered, not with arms alone, but with the hostile hand of the
righteous forming both prayers and the invincible trophy of the
Cross; <span id="fr_4649"></span>[4650](#fn_4649.md) the River shall be cut
off; the sun shall stand still; and the moon be restrained; <span
id="fr_4650"></span>[4651](#fn_4650.md) walls shall be overthrown even
without engines; <span id="fr_4651"></span>[4652](#fn_4651.md) swarms of
hornets shall go before thee to make a way for Israel, and to hold the
Gentiles in check; <span id="fr_4652"></span>[4653](#fn_4652.md) and all
the other events which are told in the history after these and with
these (not to make a long story) shall be given thee of God.  Such is
the feast thou art keeping to-day; and in this manner I would have thee
celebrate both the Birthday and the Burial of Him Who was born for thee
and suffered for thee.  Such is the Mystery of the Passover; such are
the mysteries sketched by the Law and fulfilled by Christ, the Abolisher
of the letter, the Perfecter of the Spirit, who by His Passion taught us
how to suffer, and by His glorification grants us to be glorified with
Him.

<span id="iii.xxvii-p93"></span>XXII. <span
id="fr_4653"></span>[4654](#fn_4653.md)   Now we are to examine another
fact and dogma, neglected by most people, but in my judgment well worth
enquiring into.  To Whom was that Blood offered that was shed for us,
and why was It shed?  I mean the precious and famous Blood of our God
and High priest and Sacrifice.  We were detained in bondage by the Evil
One, sold under sin, and receiving pleasure in exchange for wickedness. 
Now, since a ransom belongs only to him who holds in bondage, I ask to
whom was this offered, and for what cause?  If to the Evil One, fie upon
the outrage!  If the robber receives ransom, not only from God, but a
ransom which consists of God Himself, and has such an illustrious
payment for his tyranny, a payment for whose sake it would have been
right for him to have left us alone altogether.  But if to the Father, I
ask first, how?  For it was not by Him that we were being oppressed; and
next, On what principle did the Blood of His Only begotten Son delight
the Father, Who would not receive even Isaac, when he was being offered
by his Father, but changed the sacrifice, putting a ram in the place of
the human victim? <span id="fr_4654"></span>[4655](#fn_4654.md)   Is it not
evident that the Father accepts Him, but neither asked for Him nor
demanded Him; but on account of the Incarnation, and because Humanity
must be sanctified by the Humanity of God, <span
id="fr_4655"></span>[4656](#fn_4655.md) that He might deliver us Himself,
and overcome the tyrant, and draw us to Himself by the mediation of His
Son, Who also arranged this to the honour of the Father, Whom it is
manifest that He obeys in all things?  So much we have said of Christ;
the greater part of what we might say shall be reverenced with silence. 
But that brazen serpent <span id="fr_4656"></span>[4657](#fn_4656.md) was
hung up as a remedy for the biting serpents, not as a type of Him that
suffered for us, but as a contrast; and it saved those that looked upon
it, not because they believed it to live, but because it was killed, and
killed with it the powers that were subject to it, being destroyed as it
deserved.  And what is the fitting epitaph for it from us?  “O death,
where is thy sting?  O grave, where is thy victory?” <span
id="fr_4657"></span>[4658](#fn_4657.md)   Thou art overthrown by the Cross;
thou art slain by Him who is the Giver of life; thou art without breath,
dead, without motion, even though thou keepest the form of a serpent
lifted up on high on a pole.

<span id="iii.xxvii-p99"></span>XXIII.  Now we will partake of a
Passover which is still typical; though it is plainer than the old one. 
For that is ever new which is now becoming known.  It is ours to learn
what is that drinking and that enjoyment, and His to teach and
communicate the Word to His disciples.  For teaching is food, even to
the Giver of food.  Come hither then, and let us partake of the Law, but
in a Gospel manner, not a literal one; perfectly, not imperfectly;
eternally, not temporarily.  Let us make our Head, not the earthly
Jerusalem, but the heavenly City; <span
id="fr_4658"></span>[4659](#fn_4658.md) not that which is now trodden under
foot by armies, <span id="fr_4659"></span>[4660](#fn_4659.md) but that
which is glorified by Angels.  Let us sacrifice not young calves, nor
lambs that put forth horns and hoofs, <span
id="fr_4660"></span>[4661](#fn_4660.md) in which many parts are destitute
of life and feeling; but let us sacrifice to God the sacrifice of praise
upon the heavenly Altar, with the heavenly dances; let us hold aside the
first veil; let us approach the second, and look into the Holy of
Holies. <span id="fr_4661"></span>[4662](#fn_4661.md)   Shall I say that
which is a greater thing yet?  Let us sacrifice *ourselves* to God; or
rather let us go on sacrificing throughout every day and at every
moment.  Let us accept anything for the Word’s sake.  By sufferings let
us imitate His Passion:  by our blood let us reverence His Blood:  let
us gladly mount upon the Cross.  Sweet are the nails, though they be
very painful.  For to suffer with Christ and for Christ is better than a
life of ease with others.

<span id="iii.xxvii-p104"></span>XXIV.  If you are a Simon of
Cyrene, <span id="fr_4662"></span>[4663](#fn_4662.md) take <span
id="page_432">p. 432</span> <span id="iii.xxvii-Page_432"></span>up the
Cross and follow.  If you are crucified with Him as a robber, <span
id="fr_4663"></span>[4664](#fn_4663.md) acknowledge God as a *penitent*
robber.  If even He was numbered among the transgressors <span
id="fr_4664"></span>[4665](#fn_4664.md) for you and your sin, do you become
law-abiding for His sake.  Worship Him Who was hanged for you, even if
you yourself are hanging; make some gain even from your wickedness;
purchase salvation by your death; enter with Jesus into Paradise, <span
id="fr_4665"></span>[4666](#fn_4665.md) so that you may learn from what you
have fallen. <span id="fr_4666"></span>[4667](#fn_4666.md)   Contemplate
the glories that are there; let the murderer die outside with his
blasphemies; and if you be a Joseph of Arimathæa, <span
id="fr_4667"></span>[4668](#fn_4667.md) beg the Body from him that
crucified Him, make thine own that which cleanses the world. <span
id="fr_4668"></span>[4669](#fn_4668.md)   If you be a Nicodemus, the
worshipper of God by night, bury Him with spices. <span
id="fr_4669"></span>[4670](#fn_4669.md)   If you be a Mary, or another
Mary, or a Salome, or a Joanna, weep in the early morning.  Be first to
see the stone taken away, <span id="fr_4670"></span>[4671](#fn_4670.md) and
perhaps you will see the Angels and Jesus Himself.  Say something; hear
His Voice.  If He say to you, Touch Me not, <span
id="fr_4671"></span>[4672](#fn_4671.md) stand afar off; reverence the Word,
but grieve not; for He knoweth those to whom He appeareth first.  Keep
the feast of the Resurrection; come to the aid of Eve who was first to
fall, of Her who first embraced the Christ, and made Him known to the
disciples.  Be a Peter or a John; hasten to the Sepulchre, running
together, running against one another, vying in the noble race. <span
id="fr_4672"></span>[4673](#fn_4672.md)   And even if you be beaten in
speed, win the victory of zeal; not Looking into the tomb, but Going
in.  And if, like a Thomas, you were left out when the disciples were
assembled to whom Christ shews Himself, when you do see Him be not
faithless; <span id="fr_4673"></span>[4674](#fn_4673.md) and if you do not
believe, then believe those who tell you; and if you cannot believe them
either, then have confidence in the print of the nails.  If He descend
into Hell, <span id="fr_4674"></span>[4675](#fn_4674.md) descend with Him. 
Learn to know the mysteries of Christ there also, what is the
providential purpose of the twofold descent, to save all men absolutely
by His manifestation, or there too only them that believe.

<span id="iii.xxvii-p118"></span>XXV.  And if He ascend up into
Heaven, <span id="fr_4675"></span>[4676](#fn_4675.md) ascend with Him.  Be
one of those angels who escort Him, or one of those who receive Him. 
Bid the gates be lifted up, <span id="fr_4676"></span>[4677](#fn_4676.md)
or be made higher, that they may receive Him, exalted after His
Passion.  Answer to those who are in doubt because He bears up with Him
His body and the tokens of His Passion, which He had not when He came
down, and who therefore inquire, “Who is this King of Glory?” that it is
the Lord strong and mighty, as in all things that He hath done from time
to time and does, so now in His battle and triumph for the sake of
Mankind.  And give to the doubting of the question the twofold answer. 
And if they marvel and say as in Isaiah’s drama Who is this that cometh
from Edom and from the things of earth? Or How are the garments red of
Him that is without blood or body, as of one that treads in the full
wine-press? <span id="fr_4677"></span>[4678](#fn_4677.md) set forth the
beauty of the array of the Body that suffered, adorned by the Passion,
and made splendid by the Godhead, than which nothing can be more lovely
or more beautiful.

<span id="iii.xxvii-p122"></span>XXVI. <span
id="fr_4678"></span>[4679](#fn_4678.md)   To this what will those cavillers
say, those bitter reasoners about Godhead, those detractors of all
things that are praiseworthy, those darkeners of Light, uncultured in
respect of Wisdom, for whom Christ died in vain, unthankful creatures,
the work of the Evil One.  Do you turn this benefit into a reproach to
God?  Will you deem Him little on this account, that He humbled Himself
for your sake, and because to seek for that which had wandered the Good
Shepherd, He who layeth down His life for the sheep, <span
id="fr_4679"></span>[4680](#fn_4679.md) came upon the mountains and hills
upon which you used to sacrifice, <span
id="fr_4680"></span>[4681](#fn_4680.md) and found the wandering one; and
having found it, took it upon His shoulders, <span
id="fr_4681"></span>[4682](#fn_4681.md) on which He also bore the wood; and
having borne it, brought it back to the life above; and having brought
it back, numbered it among those who have never strayed.  That He lit a
candle, <span id="fr_4682"></span>[4683](#fn_4682.md) His own flesh, and
swept the house, by cleansing away the sin of the world, and sought for
the coin, the Royal Image that was all covered up with passions, and
calls together His friends, the Angelic Powers, at the finding of the
coin, and makes them sharers of His joy, as He had before made them
sharers of the secret of His Incarnation?  That the Light that is
exceeding bright should follow the Candle—Forerunner, <span
id="fr_4683"></span>[4684](#fn_4683.md) and the Word, the Voice, and the
Bridegroom, the Bridegroom’s friend, <span
id="fr_4684"></span>[4685](#fn_4684.md) that prepared for the Lord a
peculiar people <span id="fr_4685"></span>[4686](#fn_4685.md) and cleansed
them by the water <span id="fr_4686"></span>[4687](#fn_4686.md) in
preparation for the Spirit?  Do you Reproach God with this?  Do you
conceive of Him as less because He girds Himself with a towel and washes
His disciples, <span id="fr_4687"></span>[4688](#fn_4687.md) and shows that
humiliation is the best road to exaltation; <span
id="fr_4688"></span>[4689](#fn_4688.md) because He humbles Himself for the
sake of the soul that <span id="page_433">p. 433</span> <span
id="iii.xxvii-Page_433"></span>is bent down to the ground, <span
id="fr_4689"></span>[4690](#fn_4689.md) that He may even exalt with Himself
that which is bent double under a weight of sin?  How comes it that you
do not also charge it upon Him as a crime that He eateth with
Publicans <span id="fr_4690"></span>[4691](#fn_4690.md) and at Publicans’
tables, and makes disciples of Publicans <span
id="fr_4691"></span>[4692](#fn_4691.md) that He too may make some gain. 
And what gain?  The salvation of sinners.  If so, one must blame the
physician for stooping over suffering and putting up with evil smells in
order to give health to the sick; and him also who leans over the ditch,
that he may, according to the Law, save the beast that has fallen into
it.

<span id="iii.xxvii-p137"></span>XXVII.  He was sent, but sent according
to His Manhood (for He was of two Natures), since He was hungry and
thirsty and weary, and was distressed and wept, according to the Laws of
human nature.  But even if He were sent also as God, what of that? 
Consider the Mission to be the good pleasure of the Father, to which He
refers all that concerns Himself, both that He may honour the Eternal
Principle, and that He may avoid the appearance of being a rival God. 
For He is said on the one hand to have been betrayed, and on the other
it is written that He gave Himself up; and so too that He was raised and
taken up by the Father, and also that of His own power He rose and
ascended.  The former belongs to the Good Pleasure, the latter to His
own Authority; but you dwell upon all that diminishes Him, while you
ignore all that exalts Him.  For instance, you score that He suffered,
but you do not add “of His own Will.”  Ah, what things has the Word even
now to suffer!  By some He is honoured as God but confused with the
Father; by others He is dishonoured as Flesh, and is severed from God. 
With whom shall He be most angry—or rather which shall He forgive—those
who falsely contract Him, or those who divide Him?  For the former ought
to have made a distinction, and the latter to have made a Union, the one
in number, the other in Godhead.  Do you stumble at His Flesh?  So did
the Jews.  Do you call Him a Samaritan, <span
id="fr_4692"></span>[4693](#fn_4692.md) and the rest which I will not
utter?  This did not even the demons, O man more unbelieving than
demons, and more stupid than Jews.  The Jews recognized the title Son as
expressing equal rank; and the demons knew that He who drove them out
was God, for they were persuaded by their own experience.  But you will
not either admit the equality or confess the Godhead.  It would have
been better for you to have been circumcised and a demoniac—to reduce
the matter to an absurdity—than in uncircumcision and robust health to
be thus ill and ungodly disposed.  But for our war with such men, let it
be brought to an end by their returning, however late, to a sound mind,
if they will; or else if they will not, let it be postponed to another
occasion, if they continue as they are.  Anyhow, we will have no fear
when contending for the Trinity with the help of the Trinity.

<span id="iii.xxvii-p139"></span>XXVIII.  It is now needful for us to
sum up our discourse as follows:  We were created that we might be made
happy.  We were made happy when we were created.  We were entrusted with
Paradise that we might enjoy life.  We received a Commandment that we
might obtain a good repute by keeping it; not that God did not know what
would take place, but because He had laid down the law of Free Will.  We
were deceived because we were the objects of envy.  We were cast out
because we transgressed.  We fasted because we refused to fast, being
overpowered by the Tree of Knowledge.  For the Commandment was ancient,
coeval with ourselves, and was a kind of education of our souls and curb
of luxury, to which we were reasonably made subject, in order that we
might recover by keeping it that which we had lost by not keeping it. 
We needed an Incarnate God, a God put to death, that we might live.  We
were put to death together with Him, that we might be cleansed; we rose
again with Him because we were put to death with Him; we were glorified
with Him, because we rose again with Him.

<span id="iii.xxvii-p140"></span>XXIX.  Many indeed are the miracles of
that time:  God crucified; the sun darkened and again rekindled; for it
was fitting that the creatures should suffer with their Creator; the
veil rent; the Blood and Water shed from His Side; the one as from a
man, the other as above man; the rocks rent for the Rock’s sake; the
dead raised for a pledge of the final Resurrection of all men; the Signs
at the Sepulchre and after the Sepulchre, which none can worthily
celebrate; and yet none of these equal to the Miracle of my salvation. 
A few drops of Blood recreate the whole world, and become to all men
what rennet is to milk, drawing us together and compressing us into
unity.

<span id="iii.xxvii-p141"></span>XXX.  But, O Pascha, great and holy and
purifier of all the world—for I will speak to thee as to a living
person—O Word of God and Light and Life and Wisdom and Might—for I
rejoice in all Thy names—O Offspring and Expression and Signet of the
Great Mind; O Word conceived and Man contemplated, Who bearest all
things, binding them by the Word of Thy power; receive this discourse,
<span id="page_434">p. 434</span> <span
id="iii.xxvii-Page_434"></span>not now as firstfruits, but perhaps as
the completion of my offerings, a thanksgiving, and at the same time a
supplication, that we may suffer no evil beyond those necessary and
sacred cares in which our life has been passed; and stay the tyranny of
the body over us; (Thou seest, O Lord, how great it is and how it bows
me down) or Thine own sentence, if we are to be condemned by Thee.  But
if we are to be released, in accordance with our desire, and be received
into the Heavenly Tabernacle, there too it may be we shall offer Thee
acceptable Sacrifices upon Thine Altar, to Father and Word and Holy
Ghost; for to Thee belongeth all glory and honour and might, world
without end.  Amen.

adopts on the testimony of important <span class="sc"><span

Throughout 2 Chron. the <span class="sc"><span

which like Pascha is a transliteration of the Hebrew word.  The form
which the transliteration takes is due to the fact that the Greek
language does not tolerate these two aspirates in juxtapostion.  S.
Gregory is correct in remarking that Pascha has no real connection with
<span class="Greek"><span id="iii.xxvii-p25.2"></span>πάσχω</span> (to
suffer), though it might appear to unlearned ears that it has.

the Heave-Offering, and it is certainly used in that sense among others
(all sacrificial) in the <span class="sc"><span

in regarding the word as quite general; he also quotes Zonaras’

id="iii.xxvii-p29.5"></span>φαίρεμα</span> dicitur, quod a toto mactatæ

authority, makes it the portion which was severed from the carcase of
the victim and set apart for the Priest (*i.e.*, the heave-offering,

<span id="iii.xxvii-p33"></span> The Jewish Sacrifices had a deep inner
meaning and mystery.  In a limited sense they may be called Sacraments
of the future Atonement, which they prefigured and appealed to.  But
only in a limited sense can they be so called, because they did not
convey grace to the soul, but only appealed to the grace to come; and so
the Sin-offerings of the Law are only said to *cover*, not to *take
away* sin.  They removed the spiritual disqualification for worship; but
they did not restore full Spiritual Communion with God.  Still they were
not altogether unhallowed or useless like those of the heathen, inasmuch
as they did point forward and plead the merits of the One true
Sacrifice.

id="iii.xxvii-p35.2"></span>

<span id="iii.xxvii-p36"></span> The Greek here is very obscure.  The
meaning seems to be that which Nicetas suggests, viz.:—that our Lord in
coming to earth and becoming Incarnate did not in His Divine Nature
leave Heaven, but was, while still here on earth in His own words, “The
Son of Man Which is in Heaven.”

<span id="fn_4605"></span>[427:4606](2070070.htm#fr_4605.md) <span
id="iii.xxvii-p36.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xxvii-p37"></span> Christ is “a blessed crown of goodness”
according to the saying of David, Thou shalt bless the crown of the year
with Thy goodness ([Ps. lxv. 11](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#011.md)<span
id="iii.xxvii-p37.1"></span>).  The idea of a year is taken from the
Sun; that of the crown from the year (for the year is a circle guarded
with four seasons), and from the circle again equality.  Therefore the
crown is Christ, as adorning and beautifying the minds of believers. 
But the year of Goodness was that time when Christ moved by goodness was
declaring the Gospel, as Isaiah saith of Him, “He hath sent Me to preach
the Gospel to the poor, to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord”
([Isa. 61:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001.md),
[2](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#002.md)<span
id="iii.xxvii-p37.2"></span>).  Thus the Crown is on every side equal. 
For if one draw a line from the upper side to the lower, and the same in
a transverse direction, all the intervals will be equal.  And the Crown
is like itself, because its figure is seen alike on every side, for on
every side it is seen as a round.  Therefore Christ as to His Humanity
is called a Crown of Righteousness, as composed of all the virtues, and
having no end of His goodness and righteousness; and of that
righteousness one quality is equality, that is, it allows neither excess
nor defect.  For excess and defect do not arise from virtue and
righteousness, but from fault and unrighteousness (Nicetas).

days ([Exod. xii. 15](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#015.md)<span
id="iii.xxvii-p45.1"></span>), that is, with sin for the whole week of
this life.  The number Seven Days signifies the passing of time which
revolves in weeks.  And this number is mystical, because it is virgin
and signifies virginity and the angelic life; for it alone, as
arithmeticians teach, of all the numbers within the decade, is neither a
multiple nor a measure, and also contains in itself the Four and the
Three.  For there are four elements of the world, and the Trinity is
their Creator.  He calls it co-ordinate with the world, because the
world was made in seven days, and again because when seven thousand
years are completed the end of the world is to come (Nicetas).  S.
Augustine (Civ. Dei. c. ii. 31) says that the number Seven often stands
for the Universe, because it is made up of Four which is altogether even
(2 and 2 the sum of two even numbers) and Three which is altogether
uneven (1 and 1 and 1).

our Lord’s death was actually hastened by violent actions on the part of
the Jews, which we know was not the case; but that they were anxious
that it should take place before the Sabbath began.  The two thieves,
who were still living, received the *coup de grace* from the Roman
soldiers, who broke their legs; but our Lord, much to their astonishment
was dead already, so this course was not taken with Him, but His side
was pierced with a spear.
