<p class="c23"><a name="ii.xii-p6"></A>1.&#160; <span class="sc"><a name="ii.xii-p6.1"></A>By</span> believing <span class="sc"><a name="ii.xii-p6.2"></A>In One God</span> we cut off all misbelief in many gods, using this as a shield against Greeks; and every opposing power of heretics; and by adding, <span class="sc"><a name="ii.xii-p6.3"></A>In One God the Father</span>, we contend against those of the circumcision, who deny the Only-begotten Son of God.&#160; For, as was said yesterday, even before explaining the truths concerning our Lord Jesus Christ, we made it manifest at once, by saying &#8220;The Father,&#8221; that He is the Father of a Son:&#160; that as we understand that God is, so we may understand that He has a Son.&#160; But to those titles we add that He is also &#8220;<span class="sc"><a name="ii.xii-p6.4"></A>Almighty</span>;&#8221; and this we affirm because of Greeks and Jews&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1032"></A><A HREF="#fn_1032"><FONT SIZE="1">1033</FONT></A>
 together, and all heretics.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.xii-p8"></A>2.&#160; For of the Greeks some have said that God is the soul of the world&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1033"></A><A HREF="#fn_1033"><FONT SIZE="1">1034</FONT></A>
:&#160; and others that His power reaches only to heaven, and not to earth as well.&#160; Some also sharing their error and misusing the text which says, &#8220;<i>And Thy truth unto the clouds</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1034"></A><A HREF="#fn_1034"><FONT SIZE="1">1035</FONT></A>
,&#8221; have dared to circumscribe God&#146;s providence by the clouds and the heaven, and to alienate from God the things on earth; having forgotten the Psalm which says, <i>If I go up into heaven, Thou art there, if I go down into hell, Thou art present</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1035"></A><A HREF="#fn_1035"><FONT SIZE="1">1036</FONT></A>
.&#160; For if there is nothing higher than heaven, and if hell is deeper than the earth, He who rules the lower regions reaches the earth also.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.xii-p17"></A>3.&#160; But heretics again, as I have said before, know not One Almighty God.&#160; For He is Almighty who rules all things, who has power over all things.&#160; But they who say that one God is Lord of the soul, and some other of the body, make neither of them perfect, because either is wanting to the other&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1036"></A><A HREF="#fn_1036"><FONT SIZE="1">1037</FONT></A>
.&#160; For how is he almighty, who has power over the soul, but not over the body?&#160; And how is he almighty who has dominion over bodies, but no power over spirits?&#160; But these men the Lord confutes, saying on the contrary, <i>Rather fear ye Him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1037"></A><A HREF="#fn_1037"><FONT SIZE="1">1038</FONT></A>
.&#160; For unless the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ has the power over both, how does He subject both to punishment?&#160; For how shall He be able to take the body which is another&#146;s and cast it into hell, <i>except He first bind the strong man, and spoil his goods</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1038"></A><A HREF="#fn_1038"><FONT SIZE="1">1039</FONT></A>
?</p>  
<p><a name="ii.xii-p21"></A>4.&#160; But the Divine Scripture and the doctrines of the truth know but One God, who rules all things by His power, but endures many things of His will.&#160; For He rules even over the idolaters, but endures them of His forbearance:&#160; He rules also over the heretics who set Him at nought, but bears with them because of His long-suffering:&#160; He rules even over the devil, but bears with him of His long-suffering, not from want of power; as if defeated.&#160; For <i>he is the beginning of the Lord&#146;s creation, made to be mocked</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1039"></A><A HREF="#fn_1039"><FONT SIZE="1">1040</FONT></A>
, not by Himself, <A NAME="page_49"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 49</FONT></A> <a name="ii.xii-Page_49"></A>for that were unworthy of Him, but <i>by the Angels</i> whom He hath made.&#160; But He suffered him to live, for two purposes, that he might disgrace himself the more in his defeat, and that mankind might be crowned with victory.&#160; O all wise providence of God! which takes the wicked purpose for a groundwork of salvation for the faithful.&#160; For as He took the unbrotherly purpose of Joseph&#146;s brethren for a groundwork of His own dispensation, and, by permitting them to sell their brother from hatred, took occasion to make him king whom He would; so he permitted the devil to wrestle, that the victors might be crowned; and that when victory was gained, he might be the more disgraced as being conquered by the weaker, and men be greatly honoured as having conquered him who was once an Archangel.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.xii-p23"></A>5.&#160; Nothing then is withdrawn from the power of God; for the Scripture says of Him, <i>for all things are Thy servants</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1040"></A><A HREF="#fn_1040"><FONT SIZE="1">1041</FONT></A>
.&#160; All things alike are His servants, but from all these One, His only Son, and One, His Holy Spirit, are excepted; and all the things which are His servants serve the Lord through the One Son and in the Holy Spirit.&#160; God then rules all, and of His long-suffering endures even murderers and robbers and fornicators, having appointed a set time for recompensing every one, that if they who have had long warning are still impenitent in heart, they may receive the greater condemnation.&#160; They are kings of men, who reign upon earth, but not without the power from above:&#160; and this Nebuchadnezzar once learned by experience, when he said; <i>For His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and His power from generation to generation</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1041"></A><A HREF="#fn_1041"><FONT SIZE="1">1042</FONT></A>
.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.xii-p26"></A>6.&#160; Riches, and gold, and silver are not, as some think, the devil&#146;s&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1042"></A><A HREF="#fn_1042"><FONT SIZE="1">1043</FONT></A>
:&#160; for <i>the whole world of riches is for the faithful man, but for the faithless not even a penny</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1043"></A><A HREF="#fn_1043"><FONT SIZE="1">1044</FONT></A>
.&#160; Now nothing is more faithless than the devil; and God says plainly by the Prophet, <i>The gold is Mine, and the silver is Mine, and to whomsoever I will I give it</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1044"></A><A HREF="#fn_1044"><FONT SIZE="1">1045</FONT></A>
.&#160; Do thou but use it well, and there is no fault to be found with money: but whenever thou hast made a bad use of that which is good, then being unwilling to blame thine own management, thou impiously throwest back the blame upon the Creator.&#160; A man may even be justified by money:&#160; <i>I was hungry, and ye gave Me meat</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1045"></A><A HREF="#fn_1045"><FONT SIZE="1">1046</FONT></A>
:&#160; that certainly was from money.&#160; <i>I was naked, and ye clothed Me</i>:&#160; that certainly was by money.&#160; And wouldest thou learn that money may become a door of the kingdom of heaven?&#160; <i>Sell</i>, saith He, <i>that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1046"></A><A HREF="#fn_1046"><FONT SIZE="1">1047</FONT></A>
.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.xii-p32"></A>7.&#160; Now I have made these remarks because of those heretics who count possessions, and money, and men&#146;s bodies accursed&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1047"></A><A HREF="#fn_1047"><FONT SIZE="1">1048</FONT></A>
.&#160; For I neither wish thee to be a slave of money, nor to treat as enemies the things which God has given thee for use.&#160; Never say then that riches are the devil&#146;s:&#160; for though he say, <i>All these will I give thee, for they are delivered unto me</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1048"></A><A HREF="#fn_1048"><FONT SIZE="1">1049</FONT></A>
, one may indeed even reject his assertion; for we need not believe the liar:&#160; and yet perhaps he spake the truth, being compelled by the power of His presence:&#160; for he said not, <i>All these will I give thee</i>, for they are mine, but, <i>for they are delivered unto me</i>.&#160; He grasped not the dominion of them, but confessed that he had been entrusted&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1049"></A><A HREF="#fn_1049"><FONT SIZE="1">1050</FONT></A>
 with them, and was for a time dispensing them.&#160; But at a proper time interpreters should inquire whether his statement is false or true&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1050"></A><A HREF="#fn_1050"><FONT SIZE="1">1051</FONT></A>
.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.xii-p38"></A>8.&#160; God then is One, the Father, the Almighty, whom the brood of heretics have dared to blaspheme.&#160; Yea, they have dared to blaspheme the Lord of Sabaoth&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1051"></A><A HREF="#fn_1051"><FONT SIZE="1">1052</FONT></A>
, <i>who sitteth above the Cherubim</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1052"></A><A HREF="#fn_1052"><FONT SIZE="1">1053</FONT></A>
:&#160; they have dared to blaspheme the Lord Adonai&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1053"></A><A HREF="#fn_1053"><FONT SIZE="1">1054</FONT></A>
:&#160; they have dared to blaspheme Him who is in the Prophets the Almighty  <A NAME="page_50"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 50</FONT></A> <a name="ii.xii-Page_50"></A>God&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1054"></A><A HREF="#fn_1054"><FONT SIZE="1">1055</FONT></A>
.&#160; But worship thou One God the Almighty, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.&#160; Flee from the error of many gods, flee also from every heresy, and say like Job, <i>But I will call upon the Almighty Lord, which doeth great things and unsearchable, glorious things and marvellous without number</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1055"></A><A HREF="#fn_1055"><FONT SIZE="1">1056</FONT></A>
, and, <i>For all these things there is honour from the Almighty</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1056"></A><A HREF="#fn_1056"><FONT SIZE="1">1057</FONT></A>
:&#160; to Whom be the glory for ever and ever.&#160; Amen.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="ii.xii-p7"></A> &#8220;For even the Jewish nation had wicked heresies:&#160; for of them were&#8230;the Pharisees, who ascribe the practice of sinners to fortune and fate; and the Basmotheans, who deny providence and say that the world is made by spontaneous motion&#8221; (<i>Apost.

<p class="c66"><a name="ii.xii-p9"></A> Cicero, <i>De Natura Deorum</i>, Lib. I. 27:&#160; &#8220;Pythagoras thought that God was the soul pervading all nature.&#8221;&#160; The doctrine was accepted both by Stoics and Platonists, and became very general.&#160; Cf.
