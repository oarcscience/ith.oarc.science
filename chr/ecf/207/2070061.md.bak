<span id="iii.xviii-p1"></span> <span class="c21"><span
id="iii.xviii-p1.1"></span>Oration XXXIII.</span>

<span id="iii.xviii-p2"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="iii.xviii-p2.1"></span>Against The Arians, and Concerning
Himself.</span>

<span id="iii.xviii-p3"></span>Delivered at Constantinople about the
middle of the year 380.

<span id="iii.xviii-p4"></span>I.  <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.xviii-p4.1"></span>Where</span> are they who reproach us with
our poverty, and boast themselves of their own riches; who define the
Church by numbers, <span id="fr_3752"></span>[3753](#fn_3752.md) and scorn
the little flock; and who measure Godhead, <span
id="fr_3753"></span>[3754](#fn_3753.md) and weigh the people in the
balance, who honour the sand, and despise the luminaries of heaven; who
treasure pebbles and overlook pearls; for they know not that sand is not
in a greater degree more abundant than stars, and pebbles than lustrous
stones—<span id="page_329">p. 329</span> <span
id="iii.xviii-Page_329"></span>that the former are purer and more
precious than the latter?  Are you again indignant?  Do you again arm
yourselves?  Do you again insult us? <span
id="fr_3754"></span>[3755](#fn_3754.md)   Is this a new faith?  Restrain
your threats a little while that I may speak.  We will not insult you,
but we will convict you; we will not threaten, but we will reproach you;
we will not strike, but we will heal.  This too appears an insult!  What
pride!  Do you here also regard your equal as your slave?  If not,
permit me to speak openly; for even a brother chides his brother if he
has been defrauded by him.

<span id="iii.xviii-p8"></span>II.  Would you like me to utter to you
the words of God to Israel, stiff-necked and hardened?  “O my people
what have I done unto thee, or wherein have I injured thee, or wherein
have I wearied thee?” <span id="fr_3755"></span>[3756](#fn_3755.md)   This
language indeed is fitter from me to you who insult me.  It is a sad
thing that we watch for opportunities against each other, and having
destroyed our fellowship of spirit by diversities of opinion have become
almost more inhuman and savage to one another than even the barbarians
who are now engaged in war against us, banded together against us by the
Trinity whom we have separated; with this difference that we are not
foreigners making forays and raids upon foreigners, nor nations of
different language, which is some little consolation in the calamity,
but are making war upon one another, and almost upon those of the same
household; or if you will, we the members of the same body are consuming
and being consumed by one another.  Nor is this, bad though it be, the
extent of our calamity, for we even regard our diminution as a gain. 
But since we are in such a condition, and regulate our faith by the
times, let us compare the times with one another; you your
Emperor, <span id="fr_3756"></span>[3757](#fn_3756.md) and I my
Sovereigns; <span id="fr_3757"></span>[3758](#fn_3757.md) you Ahab and I
Josias.  Tell me of your moderation, and I will proclaim my violence. 
But indeed yours is proclaimed by many books and tongues, which I think
future ages will accept as an immortal pillory for your actions and I
will declare my own.

<span id="iii.xviii-p12"></span>III.  What tumultuous mob have I led
against you?  What soldiers have I armed?  What general boiling with
rage, and more savage than his employers, and not even a Christian, but
one who offers his impiety against us as his private worship to his own
gods? <span id="fr_3758"></span>[3759](#fn_3758.md)   Whom have I besieged
while engaged in prayer and lifting up their hands to God?  When have I
put a stop to psalmody with trumpets? or mingled the Sacramental Blood
with blood of massacre?  What spiritual sighs have I put an end to by
cries of death, or tears of penitence by tears of tragedy?  What House
of prayer have I made a burialplace?  What liturgical vessels which the
multitude may not touch have I given over to the hands of the wicked, of
a Nebuzaradan, <span id="fr_3759"></span>[3760](#fn_3759.md) chief of the
cooks, or of a Belshazzar, who wickedly used the sacred vessels for his
revels, <span id="fr_3760"></span>[3761](#fn_3760.md) and then paid a
worthy penalty for his madness?  “Altars beloved” as Holy Scripture
saith, but “now defiled.” <span id="fr_3761"></span>[3762](#fn_3761.md)  
And what licentious youth has insulted you for our sake with shameful
writhings and contortions?  O precious Throne, seat and rest of precious
men, which hast been occupied by a succession of pious Priests, who from
ancient times have taught the divine Mysteries, what heathen popular
speaker and evil tongue hath mounted thee to inveigh against the
Christian’s faith?  O modesty and majesty of Virgins, that cannot endure
the looks of even virtuous men, which of us hath shamed thee, and
outraged thee by the exposure of what may not be seen, and showed to the
eyes of the impious a pitiable sight, worthy of the fires of Sodom?  I
say nothing of deaths, which were more endurable than this shame.

<span id="iii.xviii-p17"></span>IV.  What wild beasts have we let loose
upon the bodies of Saints,—like some who have prostituted human
nature,—on one single accusation, that of not consenting to their
impiety; or defiled ourselves by communion with them, which we avoid
like the poison of a snake, not because it injures the body, but because
it blackens the depths of the soul?  Against whom have we made it a
matter of criminal accusation that they buried the dead, whom the very
beasts reverenced?  And what a charge, worthy of another theatre and of
other beasts!  What Bishop’s aged flesh have we carded with hooks in the
presence of their disciples, impotent to help them save by tears, hung
up with Christ, conquering by suffering, and sprinkling the people with
their <span id="page_330">p. 330</span> <span
id="iii.xviii-Page_330"></span>precious blood, and at last carried away
to death, to be both crucified and buried and glorified with Christ;
with Christ Who conquered the world by such victims and sacrifices? 
What priests have those contrary elements fire and water divided,
raising a strange beacon over the sea, and set on fire together with the
ship in which they put to sea? <span
id="fr_3762"></span>[3763](#fn_3762.md)   Who (to cover the more numerous
part of our woes with a veil of silence) have been accused of inhumanity
by the very magistrates who conferred such favour on them?  For even if
they did obey the lusts of those men, yet at any rate they hated the
cruelty of their purpose.  The one was opportunism, the other
calculation; the one came of the lawlessness of the Emperor, the other
of a consciousness of the laws by which they had to judge.

<span id="iii.xviii-p20"></span>V.  And to speak of older things, for
they too belong to the same fraternity; whose hands living or dead have
I cut off—to bring a lying accusation against Saints, <span
id="fr_3763"></span>[3764](#fn_3763.md) and to triumph over the faith by
bluster?  Whose exiles have I numbered as benefits, and failed to
reverence even the sacred colleges of sacred philosophers, whence I
sought their suppliants?  Nay the very contrary is the case; I have
reckoned as Martyrs those who incurred anger for the truth.  Upon whom
have I, whom you accuse of licentiousness of language, brought harlots
when they were almost fleshless and bloodless?  Which of the faithful
have I exiled from their country and given over to the hands of lawless
men, that they might be kept like wild beasts in rooms without light,
and (for this is the saddest part of the tragedy) left separated from
each other to endure the hardships of hunger and thirst, with food
measured out to them, which they had to receive through narrow openings,
so that they might not be permitted even to see their companions in
misery.  And what were they who suffered thus?  Men of whom the world
was not worthy. <span id="fr_3764"></span>[3765](#fn_3764.md)   Is it thus
that you honour faith?  Is this your kind treatment of it?  Ye know not
the greater part of these things, and that reasonably, because of the
number of these facts and the pleasure of the action.  But he who
suffers has a better memory.  There have been even some more cruel than
the times themselves, like wild boars hurled against a fence.  I demand
your victim of yesterday <span id="fr_3765"></span>[3766](#fn_3765.md) the
old man, the Abraham-like Father, whom on his return from exile you
greeted with stones in the middle of the day and in the middle of the
city.  But we, if it is not invidious to say so, begged off even our
murderers from their danger.  God says somewhere in Scripture, How shall
I pardon thee for this? <span id="fr_3766"></span>[3767](#fn_3766.md)  
Which of these things shall I praise; or rather for which shall I bind a
wreath upon you?

<span id="iii.xviii-p25"></span>VI.  Now since your antecedents are
such, I should be glad if you too will tell me of my crimes, that I may
either amend my life or be put to shame.  My greatest wish is that I may
be found free from wrong altogether; but if this may not be, at least to
be converted from my crime; for this is the second best portion of the
prudent.  For if like the just man I do not become my own accuser in the
first instance, <span id="fr_3767"></span>[3768](#fn_3767.md) yet at any
rate I gladly receive healing from another.  “Your City, you say to me,
is a little one, or rather is no city at all, but only a village, arid,
without beauty, and with few inhabitants.”  But, my good friend, this is
my misfortune, rather than my fault;—if indeed it be a misfortune; and
if it is against my will, I am to be pitied for my bad luck, if I may
put it so; but if it be willingly, I am a philosopher.  Which of these
is a crime?  Would anyone abuse a dolphin for not being a land animal,
or an ox because it is not aquatic, or a lamprey because it is
amphibious?  But we, you go on, have walls and theatres and racecourses
and palaces, and beautiful great Porticoes, and that marvellous work the
underground and overhead river, <span
id="fr_3768"></span>[3769](#fn_3768.md) and the splendid and admired
column, <span id="fr_3769"></span>[3770](#fn_3769.md) and the crowded
marketplace and a restless people, and a famous senate of highborn men.

<span id="iii.xviii-p29"></span>VII.  Why do you not also mention the
convenience of the site, and what I may call the contest between land
and sea as to which owns the City, and which adorns our Royal City with
all their good things?  This then is our crime, that while you are great
and splendid, we are small and come from a small place?  Many others do
you this wrong, indeed all those whom you excel; and must we die be<span
id="page_331">p. 331</span> <span id="iii.xviii-Page_331"></span>cause
we have not reared a city, nor built walls around it, nor can boast of
our racecourse, or our stadia, and pack of hounds, and all the follies
that are connected with these things; nor have to boast of the beauty
and splendour of our baths, and the costliness of their marbles and
pictures and golden embroideries of all sorts of species, almost
rivalling nature?  Nor have we yet rounded off the sea for ourselves, or
mingled the seasons, as of course you, the new Creators, have done, that
we may live in what is at once the pleasantest and the safest way.  Add
if you like other charges, you who say, The silver is mine and the gold
is mine, <span id="fr_3770"></span>[3771](#fn_3770.md) those words of God. 
We neither think much of riches, on which, if they increase, our Law
forbids us to set our hearts, nor do we count up yearly and daily
revenues; nor do we rival one another in loading our tables with
enchantments for our senseless belly.  For neither do we highly esteem
those things which after we have swallowed them are all of the same
worth, or rather I should say worthlessness, and are rejected.  But we
live so simply and from hand to mouth, as to differ but little from
beasts whose sustenance is without apparatus and inartificial.

<span id="iii.xviii-p31"></span>VIII.  Do you also find fault with the
raggedness of my dress, and the want of elegance in the disposition of
my face? for these are the points upon which I see that some persons who
are very insignificant pride themselves.  Will you leave my head alone,
and not jeer at it, as the children did at Elissæus?  What followed I
will not mention.  And will you leave out of your allegations my want of
education, and what seems to you the roughness and rusticity of my
elocution?  And where will you put the fact that I am not full of small
talk, nor a jester popular with company, nor great hunter of the
marketplace, nor given to chatter and gossip with any chance people upon
all sorts of subjects, so as to make even conversation grievous; nor a
frequenter of Zeuxippus, that new Jerusalem; <span
id="fr_3771"></span>[3772](#fn_3771.md) nor one who strolls from house to
house flattering and stuffing himself; but for the most part staying at
home, of low spirits and with a melancholy cast of countenance, quietly
associating with myself, the genuine critic of my actions; and perhaps
worthy of imprisonment for my uselessness?  How is it that you pardon me
for all this, and do not blame me for it?  How sweet and kind you are.

<span id="iii.xviii-p33"></span>IX.  But I am so old fashioned and such
a philosopher as to believe that one heaven is common to all; and that
so is the revolution of the sun and the moon, and the order and
arrangement of the stars; and that all have in Common an equal share and
profit in day and night, and also change of seasons, rains, fruits, and
quickening power of the air; and that the flowing rivers are a common
and abundant wealth to all; and that one and the same is the Earth, the
mother and the tomb, from which we were taken, and to which we shall
return, none having a greater share than another.  And further, above
this, we have in common reason, the Law, the Prophets, the very
Sufferings of Christ, by which we were all without exception created
anew, who partake of the same Adam, and were led astray by the serpent
and slain by sin, and are saved by the heavenly Adam and brought back by
the tree of shame to the tree of life from whence we had fallen.

<span id="iii.xviii-p34"></span>X.  I was deceived too by the Ramah of
Samuel, that little fatherland of the great man; which was no dishonour
to the Prophet, for it drew its honour not so much from itself as from
him; nor was he hindered on its account from being given to God before
his birth, or from uttering oracles, and foreseeing the future; nor only
so, but also anointing Kings and Priests, and judging the men of
illustrious cities.  I heard also of Saul, how while seeking his
father’s asses he found a kingdom.  And even David himself was taken
from the sheepfolds to be the shepherd of Israel.  What of Amos?  Was he
not, while a goatherd and scraper of sycamore fruit entrusted with the
gifts of prophecy?  How is it that I have passed over Joseph, who was
both a slave and the giver of corn to Egypt, and the father of many
myriads who were promised before to Abraham?  Aye and I was deceived by
the Carmel of Elias, who received the car of fire; and by the sheepskin
of Elissæus that had more power than a silken web or than gold forced
into garments.  I was deceived by the desert of John, which held the
greatest among them that are born of women, with that clothing, that
food, that girdle, which we know.  And I ventured even beyond these, and
found God Himself the Patron of my rusticity.  I will range myself with
Bethlehem, and will share the ignominy of the Manger; for since you
refuse on this account honour to God, it is no wonder that on the same
account you despise His herald also.  And I will bring up to you the
Fishermen, and the poor to whom the Gospel is preached, as preferred
before many rich.  Will you ever leave off priding yourselves upon your
cities?  <span id="page_332">p. 332</span> <span
id="iii.xviii-Page_332"></span>Will you ever revere that wilderness
which you abominate and despise?  I do not yet say that gold has its
birthplace in sand; nor that translucent stones are the product and
gifts of rocks; for if to these I should oppose all that is
dishonourable in cities perhaps it would be to no good end that I should
use my freedom of speech.

<span id="iii.xviii-p35"></span>XI.  But perhaps some one who is very
circumscribed and carnally minded will say, “But our herald is a
stranger and a foreigner.”  What of the Apostles?  Were not they
strangers to the many nations and cities among whom they were divided,
that the Gospel might have free course everywhere, that nothing might
miss the illumination of the Threefold Light, or be unenlightened by the
Truth; but that the night of ignorance might be dissolved for those who
sat in darkness and the shadow of death?  You have heard the words of
Paul, “that we might go the Gentiles, and they to the
Circumcision.” <span id="fr_3772"></span>[3773](#fn_3772.md)   Be it that
Judæa is Peter’s home; what has Paul in common with the Gentiles, Luke
with Achaia, Andrew with Epirus, John with Ephesus, Thomas with India,
Marc with Italy, or the rest, not to go into particulars, with those to
whom they went?  So that you must either blame them or excuse me, or
else prove that you, the ambassadors of the true Gospel, are being
insulted by trifling.  But since I have argued with you in a petty way
about these matters, I will now proceed to take a larger and more
philosophic view of them.

<span id="iii.xviii-p37"></span>XII.  My friend, every one that is of
high mind has one Country, the Heavenly Jerusalem, in which we store up
our Citizenship.  All have one family—if you look at what is here below
the dust—or if you look higher, that Inbreathing of which we are
partakers, and which we were bidden to keep, and with which I must stand
before my Judge to give an account of my heavenly nobility, and of the
Divine Image.  Everyone then is noble who has guarded this through
virtue and consent to his Archetype.  On the other hand, everyone is
ignoble who has mingled with evil, and put upon himself another form,
that of the serpent.  And these earthly countries and families are the
playthings of this our temporary life and scene.  For our country is
whatever each may have first occupied, either as tyrant, or in
misfortune; and in this we are all alike strangers and pilgrims, however
much we may play with names.  And the family is accounted noble which is
either rich from old days, or is recently raised; and of ignoble birth
that which is of poor parents, either owing to misfortune or to want of
ambition.  For how can a nobility be given from above which is at one
time beginning and at another coming to an end; and which is not given
to some, but is bestowed on others by letters patent?  Such is my mind
on this matter.  Therefore I leave it to you to pride yourself on tombs
or in myths, and I endeavour as far as I can, to purify myself from
deceits, that I may keep if possible my nobility, or else may recover
it.

<span id="iii.xviii-p38"></span>XIII.  It is thus then and for these
reasons that I, who am small and of a country without repute, have come
upon you, and that not of my own accord, nor self-sent, like many of
those who now seize upon the chief places; but because I was invited,
and compelled, and have followed the scruples of my conscience and the
Call of the Spirit.  If it be otherwise, may I continue to fight here to
no purpose, and deliver no one from his error, but may they obtain their
desire who seek the barrenness of my soul, if I lie.  But since I am
come, and perchance with no contemptible power (if I may boast myself a
little of my folly), which of those who are insatiable have I copied,
what have I emulated of opportunism, although I have such examples, even
apart from which it is hard and rare not to be bad?  Concerning what
churches or property have I disputed with you; though you have more than
enough of both, and the others too little?  What imperial edict have we
rejected and emulated?  What rulers have we fawned upon against you? 
Whose boldness have we denounced?  And what has been done on the other
side against me?  “Lord, lay not this sin to their charge,” even then I
said, for I remembered in season the words of Stephen, <span
id="fr_3773"></span>[3774](#fn_3773.md) and so I pray now.  Being reviled,
we bless:  being blasphemed we retreat. <span
id="fr_3774"></span>[3775](#fn_3774.md)

<span id="iii.xviii-p41"></span>XIV.  And if I am doing wrong in this,
that when tyrannized over I endure it, forgive me this wrong; I have
borne to be tyrannized over by others too; and I am thankful that my
moderation has brought upon me the charge of folly.  For I reckon thus,
using considerations altogether higher than any of yours; what a mere
fraction are these trials of the spittings and blows which Christ, for
Whom and by Whose aid we encounter these dangers, endured.  I do not
count them, taken altogether, worth the one crown of thorns which robbed
our conqueror of his crown, for whose sake also I learn that I am
crowned for the <span id="page_333">p. 333</span> <span
id="iii.xviii-Page_333"></span>hardness of life.  I do not reckon them
worth the one reed by which the rotten empire was destroyed; of the gall
alone, the vinegar alone, by which we were cured of the bitter taste; of
the gentleness alone which He shewed in His Passion.  Was He betrayed
with a kiss?  He reproves with a kiss, but smites not.  Is he suddenly
arrested?  He reproaches indeed, but follows; and if through zeal thou
cuttest off the ear of Malchus with the sword, He will be angry, and
will restore it.  And if one flee in a linen sheet, <span
id="fr_3775"></span>[3776](#fn_3775.md) he will defend him.  And if you ask
for the fire of Sodom upon his captors, he will not pour it forth; and
if he take a thief hanging upon the cross for his crime he will bring
him into Paradise through His Goodness.  Let all the acts of one that
loves men be loving, as were all the sufferings of Christ, to which we
could add nothing greater than, when God even died for us, to refuse on
our part to forgive even the smallest wrongs of our fellowmen.

<span id="iii.xviii-p43"></span>XV.  Moreover this also I reckoned and
still reckon with myself; and do you see if it is not quite correct.  I
have often discussed it with you before.  These men have the houses, but
we the Dweller in the house; they the Temples, we the God; and besides
it is ours to be living temples of the Living God, lively sacrifices,
reasonable burnt-offerings, perfect sacrifices, yea, gods through the
adoration of the Trinity.  They have the people, we the Angels; they
rash boldness, we faith; they threatenings, we prayer; they smiting, we
endurance; they gold and silver, we the pure word.  “Thou hast built for
thyself a wide house and large chambers (recognize the words of
Scripture), a house celled and pierced with windows.” <span
id="fr_3776"></span>[3777](#fn_3776.md)   But not yet is this loftier than
my faith, and than the heavens to which I am being borne onwards.  Is
mine a little flock?  But it is not being carried over a precipice.  Is
mine a narrow fold?  But it is unapproachable by wolves; it cannot be
entered by a robber, nor climbed by thieves and strangers.  I shall yet
see it, I know well, wider.  And many of those who are now wolves, I
must reckon among my sheep, and perhaps even amongst the shepherds. 
This is the glad tidings brought me by the Good Shepherd, for Whose sake
I lay down my life for the sheep.  I fear not for the little flock; for
it is seen at a glance.  I know my sheep and am known of mine.  Such are
they that know God and are known of God.  My sheep hear my voice, which
I have heard from the oracles of God, which I have been taught by the
Holy Fathers, which I have taught alike on all occasions, not conforming
myself to the fortune, and which I will never cease to teach; in which I
was born, and in which I will depart.

<span id="iii.xviii-p45"></span>XVI.  These I call by name (for they are
not nameless like the stars which are numbered and have names), <span
id="fr_3777"></span>[3778](#fn_3777.md) and they follow me, for I rear them
up beside the waters of rest; and they follow every such shepherd, whose
voice they love to hear, as you see; but a stranger they will not
follow, but will flee from him, because they have a habit of
distinguishing the voice of their own from that of strangers.  They will
flee from Valentinus <span id="fr_3778"></span>[3779](#fn_3778.md) with his
division of one into two, refusing to believe that the Creator is other
than the Good.  They will flee from Depth and Silence, and the mythical
Æons, that are verily worthy of Depth and Silence.  They will flee from
Marcion’s <span id="fr_3779"></span>[3780](#fn_3779.md) god, compounded of
elements and numbers; from Montanus’ <span
id="fr_3780"></span>[3781](#fn_3780.md) evil and feminine spirit; from the
matter and darkness of Manes; <span id="fr_3781"></span>[3782](#fn_3781.md)
from Novatus’ <span id="fr_3782"></span>[3783](#fn_3782.md) boasting and
wordy assumption of purity; from the analysis and confusion of
Sabellius, <span id="fr_3783"></span>[3784](#fn_3783.md) and if I may use
the expression, <span id="page_334">p. 334</span> <span
id="iii.xviii-Page_334"></span>his absorption, contracting the Three
into One, instead of defining the One in Three Personalities; from the
difference of natures taught by Arius <span
id="fr_3784"></span>[3785](#fn_3784.md) and his followers, and their new
Judaism, confining the Godhead to the Unbegotten; from Photinus <span
id="fr_3785"></span>[3786](#fn_3785.md) earthly Christ, who took his
beginning from Mary.  But they worship the Father and the Son and the
Holy Ghost, One Godhead; God the Father, God the Son and (do not be
angry) God the Holy Ghost, One Nature in Three Personalities,
intellectual, perfect, Self-existent, numerically separate, but not
separate in Godhead.

<span id="iii.xviii-p55"></span>XVII.  These words let everyone who
threatens me to-day concede to me; the rest let whoever will claim.  The
Father will not endure to be deprived of the Son, nor the Son of the
Holy Ghost.  Yet that must happen if They are confined to time, and are
created Beings…for that which is created is not God.  Neither will I
bear to be deprived of my consecration; One Lord, One Faith, One
Baptism.  If this be cancelled, from whom shall I get a second?  What
say you, you who destroy Baptism or repeat it?  Can a man be spiritual
without the Spirit?  Has he a share in the Spirit who does not honour
the Spirit?  Can he honour Him who is baptized into a creature and a
fellow-servant?  It is not so; it is not so; for all your talk.  I will
not play Thee false, O Unoriginate Father, or Thee O Only-begotten Word,
or Thee O Holy Ghost.  I know Whom I have confessed, and whom I have
renounced, and to Whom I have joined myself.  I will not allow myself,
after having been taught the words of the faithful, to learn also those
of the unfaithful; to confess the truth, and then range myself with
falsehood; to come down for consecration and to go back even less
hallowed; having been baptised that I might live, to be killed by the
water, like infants who die in the very birthpangs, and receive death
simultaneously with birth.  Why make me at once blessed and wretched,
newly enlightened and unenlightened, Divine and godless, that I may make
shipwreck even of the hope of regeneration?  A few words will suffice. 
Remember your confession.  Into what were you baptised?  The Father? 
Good but Jewish still.  The Son?…good…but not yet perfect.  The Holy
Ghost?…Very good…this is perfect.  Now was it into these simply, or some
common name of Them?  The latter.  And what was the common Name?  Why,
God.  In this common Name believe, and ride on prosperously and
reign, <span id="fr_3786"></span>[3787](#fn_3786.md) and pass on from hence
into the Bliss of Heaven.  And that is, as I think, the more distinct
apprehension of These; to which may we all come, in the same Christ our
God, to Whom be the glory and the might, with the Unoriginate Father,
and the Lifegiving Spirit, now and for ever and to ages of ages.  Amen.

<span id="iii.xviii-p13"></span> Dr. Ullmann makes this passage refer to
outrages perpetrated in Constantinople itself on Gregory, by his Arian
opponents.  On one occasion, he says, in the night time the meetingplace
of the Orthodox was assailed; a mob of Arians, and in particular women
of the lowest stamp, set on by monks, armed themselves with sticks and
stones, and forced an entrance into the peaceful place of holy worship. 
The champion of orthodoxy well nigh became a martyr to his convictions;
the Altar was profaned, the consecrated wine was mixed with blood; the
house of prayer was made a scene of outrage and unbridled
licentiousness.  The Benedictine Editors, however, whom Benoit follows,
think the reference is to the disturbances in Alexandria when the Arian
Lucius was forcibly intruded into the Chair of Athanasius by the Prefect
Palladius.  A full account of the atrocities by which his installation
was marked is to be found in a letter of Peter, the expelled or orthodox
Patriarch, preserved in Theodoret (H. E. IV. 22).  This Lucius was
living in Constantinople and abetting the Arian party there at the time
when Gregory pronounced this Oration.

<span id="iii.xviii-p18"></span> Socrates (H. E. IV. 16) gives an
account of the murder of eighty Priests by order of Valens.  The Prefect
of Nicomedia, being afraid to execute the Emperor’s commands by a public
action, put these men on board a ship, as if to send them into exile,
but gave orders to the crew to set the vessel on fire on the high seas,
and leave the prisoners to their fate.

<span id="iii.xviii-p19"></span>Billius, however, thinks that the
reference is to the martyrdom of a single Priest, whose death in this
way is described by S. Gregory in his panegyric on Maximus (Or. xxv. 10,
p. 461, 462).

<span id="iii.xviii-p21"></span> S. Athanasius was accused by the Arians
of having murdered a Meletian Bishop named Arsenius, and cut off his
hand to use for magical purposes; and at a Synod held at Tyre in 334
they produced the alleged hand in a box.  Athanasius, however, was able
to produce Arsenius alive and unmutilated; but even so his accusers were
not satisfied.

id="iii.xviii-p47.1"></span>Valentinus</span>, a celebrated Gnostic
leader of the Second Century, was one of the first Gnostics who taught
in Rome.  He was probably of Ægypto-Jewish descent, and was educated at
Alexandria.  He died in Cyprus about 160.  His system is a very curious
one, giving the reins to the wildest vagaries of the imagination.  The
original eternal Being, or Absolute Existence, he called Bythos or
Depth; and to this he assigned as a wife Sige or Silence.  From this
union there sprang thirty Æons or Emanations, who unfolded the
Attributes of the Deity and created the world.

Valentinus.  He was a native of Sinope in Pontus, of which city his
father was Bishop.  He supposed Three Principles, the Good God, Who was
first revealed by Christ; the Just Creator, Who is the “hot tempered and
imperfect” God of the Jews; and the intrinsically evil Hyle or Matter,
which is ruled by the Devil.  He also distinguished two Messiahs; one a
mere warrior prince sent by the Jewish God to restore Israel; the other
sent by the Good God for the delivery of the whole human race.

the Paraclete.  Connected with him were two Prophetesses, Priscilla and
Maximilla, who left their husbands to follow him.  His heresy, or rather
his schism, spread to Rome and Northern Africa, and threw the whole
Church into confusion.  He was very early anathematized by Bishops and
Synods of Asia, but he carried the great African, Tertullian, away by
his frenzy.

co-eternity of two contradictory principles, Light and Darkness, Spirit

Century, S. Augustine himself having been for nine years led away by
it.  It is believed not to be wholly extinct even now in some parts of
Eastern Christendom.

who at first rebelled against his Bishop, S. Cyprian, on account of his
severity in the treatment of persons who had lapsed in the Decian
persecution.  At Rome, however, this same Novatus, either out of simple
antagonism to constituted authority, or because he had really changed
his views, adopted the extremest rigorism, and became one of the most
violent partisans of the Priest Novatian, whom his followers contrived
to get consecrated as a rival Bishop of Rome, in opposition to
Cornelius, the reigning Pope.  They set up a new “church,” and arrogated
to themselves an exclusive claim to the title of Cathari, the Pure.

flourished in the fourth century, a little earlier than S. Gregory.  He
seems to have taught that our Lord Jesus Christ was a mere man, and had
no existence previous to His Birth of the Virgin Mary.  He made Jesus
rise on the basis of His human nature, by a course of moral improvement,
to the divine dignity, so that the Divine in Him is a thing of growth:
