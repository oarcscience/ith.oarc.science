id="iv.iii.xix-p1.1"></span>Ep. XLIX.  To Basil.  (The Praises of
Quiet.)</span>

<span id="iv.iii.xix-p2"></span>You accuse me of laziness and idleness,
because I did not accept your Sasima, and because I have not bestirred
myself like a Bishop, <span id="page_454">p. 454</span> <span
id="iv.iii.xix-Page_454"></span>and do not arm you against each other
like a bone thrown into the midst of dogs.  My greatest business always
is to keep free from business.  And to give you an idea of one of my
good points, so much do I value freedom from business, that I think I
might even be a standard to all men of this kind of magnanimity, and if
only all men would imitate me the Churches would have no troubles; nor
would the faith, which every one uses as a weapon in his private
quarrels, be pulled in pieces.
