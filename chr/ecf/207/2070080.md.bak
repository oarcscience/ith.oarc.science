which is not now extant.)

<span id="iv.iii.i-p5"></span>I have failed, I confess, to keep my
promise.  I had engaged even at Athens, at the time of our friendship
and intimate connection there (for I can find no better word for it), to
join you in a life of philosophy.  But I failed to keep my promise, not
of my own will, but because one law prevailed against another; I mean
the law which bids us honour our parents overpowered the law of our
friendship and intercourse.  Yet I will not fail you altogether, if you
will accept this offer.  I shall be with you half the time, and half of
it you will be with me, that we may have the whole in common, and that
our friendship may be on equal terms; and so it will be arranged in such
a way that my parents will not be grieved, and yet I shall gain you.
