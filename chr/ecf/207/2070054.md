<span id="iii.xi"></span>

<span id="iii.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c21"><span
id="iii.xi-p1.1"></span>Oration XXI.</span>

<span id="iii.xi-p2"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="iii.xi-p2.1"></span>On the Great Athanasius, Bishop of
Alexandria.</span>

<span id="iii.xi-p3"></span>The reference in §22 to “the Council which
sat first at Seleucia…and afterwards at this mighty city,” leaves no
room for doubting that the Oration was delivered at Constantinople. 
Further local colour is found in the allusions of §5.  We are assured by
the panegyric on S. Cyprian (Orat. xxiv. 1) that it was already the
custom of the Church of Constantinople to observe annual festivals in
honour of the Saints:  and at present two days are kept by the Eastern
Church, viz., Jan. 18th, as the day of the actual death of S.
Athanasius, and May 2d, in memory of the translation of his remains to
the church of S. Sophia at Constantinople.  Probably, therefore, this
Oration was delivered on the former day, on which Assemani holds that S.
Athanasius died.  Papebroke and (with some hesitation) Dr. Bright
pronounce in favour of May 2d.  Tillemont supposes that <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.xi-p3.1"></span>a.d.</span> 379 is the year of
its delivery; in which case it must have been very shortly after S.
Gregory’s arrival in the city.  Since, however, no allusion is made to
this, it seems, on the whole, more likely that it should be assigned to
<span class="sc"><span id="iii.xi-p3.2"></span>a.d.</span> 380.  The
sermon takes high rank, even among S. Gregory’s discourses, as the model
of an ecclesiastical panegyric.  It lacks, however, the charm of
personal affection and intimate acquaintance with the inner life, which
is characteristic of the orations concerned with his own relatives and
friends.

<span id="iii.xi-p4"></span>1.  <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.xi-p4.1"></span>In</span> praising Athanasius, I shall be
praising virtue.  To speak of him and to praise virtue are identical,
because he had, or, to speak more truly, has embraced virtue in its
entirety.  For all who have lived according to God still live unto God,
though they have departed hence.  For this reason, God is called the God
of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, since He is the God, not of the dead, but
of the living. <span id="fr_3271"></span>[3272](#fn_3271.md)   Again, in
praising virtue, I shall be praising God, who gives virtue to men and
lifts them up, or lifts them up again, to Himself by the enlightenment
which is akin to Himself. <span id="fr_3272"></span>[3273](#fn_3272.md)  
For many and great as are our blessings—none can say how many and how
great—which we have and shall have from God, this is the greatest and
kindliest of all, our inclination and relationship to Him.  For God is
to intelligible things what the sun is to the things of sense.  The one
lightens the visible, the other the invisible, world.  The one makes our
bodily eyes to see the sun, the other makes our intellectual natures to
see God.  And, as that, which bestows on the things which see and are
seen the power of seeing and being seen, is itself the most beautiful of
visible things; so God, who creates, for those who think, and that which
is thought of, the power of thinking and being thought of, is Himself
the highest of the objects of thought, in Whom every desire finds its
bourne, beyond <span id="page_270">p. 270</span> <span
id="iii.xi-Page_270"></span>Whom it can no further go.  For not even the
most philosophic, the most piercing, the most curious intellect has, or
can ever have, a more exalted object.  For this is the utmost of things
desirable, and they who arrive at it find an entire rest from
speculation.

<span id="iii.xi-p7"></span>2.  Whoever has been permitted to escape by
reason and contemplation from matter and this fleshly cloud or veil
(whichever it should be called) and to hold communion with God, and be
associated, as far as man’s nature can attain, with the purest Light,
blessed is he, both from his ascent from hence, and for his deification
there, which is conferred by true philosophy, and by rising superior to
the dualism of matter, through the unity which is perceived in the
Trinity.  And whosoever has been depraved by being knit to the flesh,
and so far oppressed by the clay that he cannot look at the rays of
truth, nor rise above things below, though he is born from above, and
called to things above, I hold him to be miserable in his blindness,
even though he may abound in things of this world; and all the more,
because he is the sport of his abundance, and is persuaded by it that
something else is beautiful instead of that which is really beautiful,
reaping, as the poor fruit of his poor opinion, the sentence of
darkness, or the seeing Him to be fire, Whom he did not recognize as
light.

<span id="iii.xi-p8"></span>3.  Such has been the philosophy of few,
both nowadays and of old—for few are the men of God, though all are His
handiwork,—among lawgivers, generals, priests, Prophets, Evangelists,
Apostles, shepherds, teachers, and all the spiritual host and band—and,
among them all, of him whom now we praise.  And whom do I mean by
these?  Men like Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, the twelve
Patriarchs, Moses, Aaron, Joshua, the Judges, Samuel, David, to some
extent Solomon, Elijah, Elisha, the Prophets before the captivity, those
after the captivity, and, though last in order, first in truth, those
who were concerned with Christ’s Incarnation or taking of our nature,
the lamp <span id="fr_3273"></span>[3274](#fn_3273.md) before the Light,
the voice before the Word, the mediator before the Mediator, the
mediator between the old covenant and the new, the famous John, the
disciples of Christ, those after Christ, who were set over the people,
or illustrious in word, or conspicuous for miracles, or made perfect
through their blood.

<span id="iii.xi-p10"></span>4.  With some of these Athanasius vied, by
some he was slightly excelled, and others, if it is not bold to say so,
he surpassed:  some he made his models in mental power, others in
activity, others in meekness, others in zeal, others in dangers, others
in most respects, others in all, gathering from one and another various
forms of beauty (like men who paint figures of ideal excellence), and
combining them in his single soul, he made one perfect form of virtue
out of all, excelling in action men of intellectual capacity, in
intellect men of action; or, if you will, surpassing in intellect men
renowned for intellect, in action those of the greatest active power;
outstripping those who had moderate reputation in both respects, by his
eminence in either, and those who stood highest in one or other, by his
powers in both; and, if it is a great thing for those who have received
an example, so to use it as to attach themselves to virtue, he has no
inferior title to fame, who for our advantage has set an example to
those who come after him.

<span id="iii.xi-p11"></span>5.  To speak of and admire him fully, would
perhaps be too long a task for the present purpose of my discourse, and
would take the form of a history rather than of a panegyric:  a history
which it has been the object of my desires to commit to writing for the
pleasure and instruction of posterity, as he himself wrote the life of
the divine Antony, <span id="fr_3274"></span>[3275](#fn_3274.md) and set
forth, in the form of a narrative, the laws of the monastic life. 
Accordingly, after entering into a few of the many details of his
history, such as memory suggests at the moment as most noteworthy, in
order both to satisfy my own longing and fulfil the duty which befits
the festival, we will leave the many others to those who know them.  For
indeed, it is neither pious nor safe, while the lives of the ungodly are
honoured by recollection, to pass by in silence those who have lived
piously, especially in a city which could hardly be saved by many
examples of virtue, making sport, as it does, of Divine things, no less
than of the horse-race and the theatre.

<span id="iii.xi-p13"></span>6.  He was brought up, from the first, in
religious habits and practices, after a brief study of literature and
philosophy, so that he might not be utterly unskilled in such subjects,
or ignorant of matters which he had determined to despise.  For his
generous and eager soul could not brook being occupied in vanities, like
unskilled athletes, who beat the air instead of their antagonists and
lose the prize.  From meditating on every book of the Old and New
Testament, with a depth such as none else has applied even to one of
them, he grew <span id="page_271">p. 271</span> <span
id="iii.xi-Page_271"></span>rich in contemplation, rich in splendour of
life, combining them in wondrous sort by that golden bond which few can
weave; using life as the guide of contemplation, contemplation as the
seal of life.  For the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and,
so to say, its first swathing band; but, when wisdom has burst the bonds
of fear and risen up to love, it makes us friends of God, and sons
instead of bondsmen.

<span id="iii.xi-p14"></span>7.  Thus brought up and trained, as even
now those should be who are to preside over the people, and take the
direction of the mighty body of Christ, <span
id="fr_3275"></span>[3276](#fn_3275.md) according to the will and
foreknowledge of God, which lays long before the foundations of great
deeds, he was invested with this important ministry, and made one of
those who draw near to the God Who draws near to us, and deemed worthy
of the holy office and rank, and, after passing through the entire
series of orders, he was (to make my story short) entrusted with the
chief rule over the people, in other words, the charge of the whole
world:  nor can I say whether he received the priesthood as the reward
of virtue, or to be the fountain and life of the Church.  For she, like
Ishmael, <span id="fr_3276"></span>[3277](#fn_3276.md) fainting from her
thirst for the truth, needed to be given to drink, or, like
Elijah, <span id="fr_3277"></span>[3278](#fn_3277.md) to be refreshed from
the brook, when the land was parched by drought; and, when but faintly
breathing, to be restored to life and left as a seed to Israel, <span
id="fr_3278"></span>[3279](#fn_3278.md) that we might not become like Sodom
and Gomorrah, <span id="fr_3279"></span>[3280](#fn_3279.md) whose
destruction by the rain of fire and brimstone is only more notorious
than their wickedness.  Therefore, when we were cast down, a horn of
salvation was raised up for us, <span
id="fr_3280"></span>[3281](#fn_3280.md) and a chief corner stone, <span
id="fr_3281"></span>[3282](#fn_3281.md) knitting us to itself and to one
another, was laid in due season, or a fire <span
id="fr_3282"></span>[3283](#fn_3282.md) to purify our base and evil
matter, <span id="fr_3283"></span>[3284](#fn_3283.md) or a farmer’s
fan <span id="fr_3284"></span>[3285](#fn_3284.md) to winnow the light from
the weighty in doctrine, or a sword to cut out the roots of wickedness;
and so the Word finds him as his own ally, and the Spirit takes
possession of one who will breathe on His behalf.

<span id="iii.xi-p25"></span>8.  Thus, and for these reasons, by the
vote of the whole people, not in the evil fashion which has since
prevailed, nor by means of bloodshed and oppression, but in an apostolic
and spiritual manner, he is led up to the throne <span
id="fr_3285"></span>[3286](#fn_3285.md) of Saint Mark, to succeed him in
piety, no less than in office; in the latter indeed at a great distance
from him, in the former, which is the genuine right of succession,
following him closely.  For unity in doctrine deserves unity in office;
and a rival teacher sets up a rival throne; the one is a successor in
reality, the other but in name.  For it is not the intruder, but he
whose rights are intruded upon, who is the successor, not the
lawbreaker, but the lawfully appointed, not the man of contrary
opinions, but the man of the same faith; if this is not what we mean by
successor, he succeeds in the same sense as disease to health, darkness
to light, storm to calm, and frenzy to sound sense.

<span id="iii.xi-p27"></span>9.  The duties of his office he discharged
in the same spirit as that in which he had been preferred to it.  For he
did not at once, after taking possession of his throne, like men who
have unexpectedly seized upon some sovereignty or inheritance, grow
insolent from intoxication.  This is the conduct of illegitimate and
intrusive priests, who are unworthy of their vocation; whose preparation
for the priesthood has cost them nothing, who have endured no
inconvenience for the sake of virtue, who only begin to study religion
when appointed to teach it, and undertake the cleansing of others before
being cleansed themselves; yesterday sacrilegious, to-day sacerdotal;
yesterday excluded from the sanctuary, <span
id="fr_3286"></span>[3287](#fn_3286.md) to-day its officiants; proficient
in vice, novices in piety; the product of the favour of man, not of the
grace of the Spirit; who, having run through the whole gamut of
violence, at last tyrannize over even piety; who, instead of gaining
credit for their office by their character, need for their character the
credit of their office, thus subverting the due relation between them;
who ought to offer more sacrifices <span
id="fr_3287"></span>[3288](#fn_3287.md) for themselves than for the
ignorances of the people; <span id="fr_3288"></span>[3289](#fn_3288.md) who
inevitably fall into one of two errors, either, from their own need of
indulgence, being excessively indulgent, and so even teaching, instead
of checking, vice, or cloaking their own sins under the harshness of
their rule.  Both these extremes he avoided; he was sublime in action,
lowly in mind; inaccessible in virtue, most accessible in intercourse;
gentle, free from anger, sympathetic, sweet in words, sweeter in
disposition; angelic in appearance, more angelic in mind; calm in
rebuke, persuasive in praise, without spoiling the good effect of either
by excess, but rebuking with the tenderness of a father, praising with
the dignity of a <span id="page_272">p. 272</span> <span
id="iii.xi-Page_272"></span>ruler, his tenderness was not dissipated,
nor his severity sour; for the one was reasonable, the other prudent,
and both truly wise; his disposition sufficed for the training of his
spiritual children, with very little need of words; his words with very
little need of the rod, <span id="fr_3289"></span>[3290](#fn_3289.md) and
his moderate use of the rod with still less for the knife.

<span id="iii.xi-p32"></span>10.  But why should I paint for you the
portrait of the man?  St. Paul <span
id="fr_3290"></span>[3291](#fn_3290.md) has sketched him by anticipation. 
This he does, when he sings the praises of the great High-priest, who
hath passed through the heavens <span
id="fr_3291"></span>[3292](#fn_3291.md) (for I will venture to say even
this, since Scripture <span id="fr_3292"></span>[3293](#fn_3292.md) can
call those who live according to Christ by the name of Christs): <span
id="fr_3293"></span>[3294](#fn_3293.md)   and again when by the rules in
his letter to Timothy, <span id="fr_3294"></span>[3295](#fn_3294.md) he
gives a model for future Bishops:  for if you will apply the law as a
test to him who deserves these praises, you will clearly perceive his
perfect exactness.  Come then to aid me in my panegyric; for I am
labouring heavily in my speech, and though I desire to pass by point
after point, they seize upon me one after another, and I can find no
surpassing excellence in a form which is in all respects well
proportioned and beautiful; for each as it occurs to me seems fairer
than the rest and so takes by storm my speech.  Come then I pray, you
who have been his admirers and witnesses, divide among yourselves his
excellences, contend bravely with one another, men and women alike,
young men and maidens, old men and children, priests and people,
solitaries and cenobites, <span id="fr_3295"></span>[3296](#fn_3295.md) men
of simple or of exact life, contemplatives or practically minded.  Let
one praise him in his fastings and prayers as if he had been disembodied
and immaterial, another his unweariedness and zeal for vigils and
psalmody, another his patronage of the needy, another his dauntlessness
towards the powerful, or his condescension to the lowly.  Let the
virgins celebrate the friend of the Bridegroom; <span
id="fr_3296"></span>[3297](#fn_3296.md) those under the yoke <span
id="fr_3297"></span>[3298](#fn_3297.md) their restrainer, hermits him who
lent wings to their course, cenobites their lawgiver, simple folk their
guide, contemplatives the divine, the joyous their bridle, the
unfortunate their consolation, the hoary-headed their staff, youths
their instructor, the poor their resource, the wealthy their steward. 
Even the widows will, methinks, praise their protector, even the orphans
their father, even the poor their benefactor, strangers their
entertainer, brethren the man of brotherly love, the sick their
physician, in whatever sickness or treatment you will, the healthy the
guard of health, yea all men him who made himself all things to all men
that he might gain almost, if not quite, all.

<span id="iii.xi-p41"></span>11.  On these grounds, as I have said, I
leave others, who have leisure to admire the minor details of his
character, to admire and extol him.  I call them minor details only in
comparing him and his character with his own standard, for that which
hath been made glorious hath not been made glorious, even though it be
exceeding splendid by reason of the glory that surpasseth, <span
id="fr_3298"></span>[3299](#fn_3298.md) as we are told; for indeed the
minor points of his excellence would suffice to win celebrity for
others.  But since it would be intolerable for me to leave the word and
serve <span id="fr_3299"></span>[3300](#fn_3299.md) less important details,
I must turn to that which is his chief characteristic; and God alone, on
Whose behalf I am speaking, can enable me to say anything worthy of a
soul so noble and so mighty in the word.

<span id="iii.xi-p44"></span>12.  In the palmy days of the Church, when
all was well, the present elaborate, far-fetched and artificial
treatment of Theology had not made its way into the schools of divinity,
but playing with pebbles which deceive the eye by the quickness of their
changes, or dancing before an audience with varied and effeminate
contortions, were looked upon as all one with speaking or hearing of God
in a way unusual or frivolous.  But since the Sextuses <span
id="fr_3300"></span>[3301](#fn_3300.md) and Pyrrhos, and the antithetic
style, like a dire and malignant disease, have infected our churches,
and babbling is reputed culture, and, as the book of the Acts <span
id="fr_3301"></span>[3302](#fn_3301.md) says of the Athenians, we spend our
time in nothing else but either to tell or to hear some new thing.  O
what Jeremiah <span id="fr_3302"></span>[3303](#fn_3302.md) will bewail our
confusion and blind madness; he alone could utter lamentations befitting
our misfortunes.

<span id="iii.xi-p48"></span>13.  The beginning of this madness was
Arius (whose name is derived from frenzy <span
id="fr_3303"></span>[3304](#fn_3303) .md), who paid the penalty of his
unbridled tongue by his death in a profane spot, <span
id="fr_3304"></span>[3305](#fn_3304.md) brought about by prayer not by
disease, when he like Judas <span id="fr_3305"></span>[3306](#fn_3305.md)
burst asunder <span id="fr_3306"></span>[3307](#fn_3306.md) for his similar
treachery <span id="page_273">p. 273</span> <span
id="iii.xi-Page_273"></span>to the Word.  Then others, catching the
infection, organized an art of impiety, and, confining Deity to the
Unbegotten, expelled from Deity not only the Begotten, but also the
Proceeding one, and honoured the Trinity with communion in name <span
id="fr_3307"></span>[3308](#fn_3307.md) alone, or even refused to retain
this for it.  Not so that blessed one, Who was indeed a man of God and a
mighty trumpet of truth:  but being aware that to contract <span
id="fr_3308"></span>[3309](#fn_3308.md) the Three Persons to a numerical
Unity is heretical, and the innovation of Sabellius, who first devised a
contraction of Deity; and that to sever the Three Persons by a
distinction of nature, is an unnatural mutilation of Deity; he both
happily preserved the Unity, which belongs to the Godhead, and
religiously taught the Trinity, which refers <span
id="fr_3309"></span>[3310](#fn_3309.md) to Personality, neither confounding
the Three Persons in the Unity, nor dividing the Substance among the
Three Persons, but abiding within the bounds of piety, by avoiding
excessive inclination or opposition to either side.

<span id="iii.xi-p56"></span>14.  And therefore, first in the holy Synod
of Nicæa, <span id="fr_3310"></span>[3311](#fn_3310.md) the gathering of
the three hundred and eighteen chosen men, united by the Holy Ghost, as
far as in him lay, he stayed the disease.  Though not yet ranked among
the Bishops, he held the first rank among the members of the Council,
for preference was given to virtue just as much as to office. 
Afterwards, when the flame had been fanned by the blasts of the evil
one, and had spread very widely (hence came the tragedies of which
almost the whole earth and sea are full), the fight raged fiercely
around him who was the noble champion of the Word.  For the assault is
hottest upon the point of resistance, while various dangers surround it
on every side:  for impiety is skilful in designing evils, and
excessively daring in taking them in hand:  and how would they spare
men, who had not spared the Godhead?  Yet one of the assaults was the
most dangerous of all:  and I myself contribute somewhat to this scene;
yea, let me plead for the innocence of my dear fatherland, for the
wickedness was not due to the land that bore them, but to the men who
undertook it.  For holy indeed is that land, and everywhere noted for
its piety, but these men are unworthy of the Church which bore them, and
ye have heard of a briar growing in a vine; <span
id="fr_3311"></span>[3312](#fn_3311.md) and the traitor <span
id="fr_3312"></span>[3313](#fn_3312.md) was Judas, one of the disciples.

<span id="iii.xi-p60"></span>15.  There are some who do not excuse even
my namesake <span id="fr_3313"></span>[3314](#fn_3313.md) from blame; who,
living at Alexandria at the time for the sake of culture, although he
had been most kindly treated by him, as if the dearest of his children,
and received his special confidence, yet joined in the revolutionary
plot against his father and patron:  for, though others took the active
part in it, the hand of Absalom <span
id="fr_3314"></span>[3315](#fn_3314.md) was with them, as the saying goes. 
If any of you had heard of the hand which was produced by fraud against
the Saint, and the corpse <span id="fr_3315"></span>[3316](#fn_3315.md) of
the living man, and the unjust banishment, he knows what I mean.  But
this I will gladly forget.  For on doubtful points, I am disposed to
think we ought to incline to the charitable side, and acquit rather than
condemn the accused.  For a bad man would speedily condemn even a good
man, while a good man would not be ready to condemn even a bad one.  For
one who is not ready to do ill, is not inclined even to suspect it.  I
come now to what is matter of fact, not of report, what is vouched for
as truth instead of unverified suspicion.

<span id="iii.xi-p64"></span>16.  There was a monster <span
id="fr_3316"></span>[3317](#fn_3316.md) from Cappadocia, born on our
farthest confines, of low birth, and lower mind, whose blood was not
perfectly free, but mongrel, as we know that of mules to be; at first,
dependent on the table of others, whose price was a barley cake, who had
learnt to say and do everything with an eye to his stomach, and, at
last, after sneaking into public life, and filling its lowest offices,
such as that of contractor for swine’s flesh, the soldiers’ rations, and
then having proved himself a scoundrel for the sake of greed in this
public trust, and been stripped to the skin, contrived to escape, and
after passing, as exiles do, from country to country and city to city,
last of all, in an evil hour for the Christian community, like one of
the plagues of Egypt, he reached Alexandria.  There, his wanderings
being stayed, he began his villany.  Good for nothing in all other
respects, without culture, without fluency in conversation, without even
the form and pretence of reverence, his <span id="page_274">p.
274</span> <span id="iii.xi-Page_274"></span>skill in working villany
and confusion was unequalled.

<span id="iii.xi-p66"></span>17.  His acts of insolence towards the
saint you all know in full detail.  Often were the righteous given into
the hands of the wicked, <span id="fr_3317"></span>[3318](#fn_3317.md) not
that the latter might be honoured, but that the former might be tested: 
and though the wicked come, as it is written, to an awful death, <span
id="fr_3318"></span>[3319](#fn_3318.md) nevertheless for the present the
godly are a laughing stock, while the goodness of God and the great
treasuries of what is in store for each of them hereafter are
concealed.  Then indeed word and deed and thought will be weighed in the
just balances of God, as He arises to judge the earth, <span
id="fr_3319"></span>[3320](#fn_3319.md) gathering together counsel and
works, and revealing what He had kept sealed up. <span
id="fr_3320"></span>[3321](#fn_3320.md)   Of this let the words and
sufferings of Job convince thee, who was a truthful, blameless, just,
godfearing man, with all those other qualities which are testified of
him, and yet was smitten with such a succession of remarkable
visitations, at the hands of him who begged for power over him, that,
although many have often suffered in the whole course of time, and some
even have, as is probable, been grievously afflicted, yet none can be
compared with him in misfortunes.  For he not only suffered, without
being allowed space to mourn for his losses in their rapid succession,
the loss of his money, his possessions, his large and fair family,
blessings for which all men care; but was at last smitten with an
incurable disease horrible to look upon, and, to crown his misfortunes,
had a wife whose only comfort was evil counsel.  For his surpassing
troubles were those of his soul added to those of the body. <span
id="fr_3321"></span>[3322](#fn_3321.md)   He had also among his friends
truly miserable comforters, <span id="fr_3322"></span>[3323](#fn_3322.md)
as he calls them, who could not help him.  For when they saw his
suffering, in ignorance of its hidden meaning, they supposed his
disaster to be the punishment of vice and not the touchstone of virtue. 
And they not only thought this, but were not even ashamed to reproach
him with his lot, <span id="fr_3323"></span>[3324](#fn_3323.md) at a time
when, even if he had been suffering for vice, they ought to have treated
his grief with words of consolation.

<span id="iii.xi-p74"></span>18.  Such was the lot of Job:  such at
first sight his history.  In reality it was a contest between virtue and
envy: <span id="fr_3324"></span>[3325](#fn_3324.md)   the one straining
every nerve to overcome the good, the other enduring everything, that it
might abide unsubdued; the one striving to smooth the way for vice, by
means of the chastisement of the upright, the other to retain its hold
upon the good, even if they do exceed others in misfortunes.  What then
of Him who answered Job out of the whirlwind and cloud, <span
id="fr_3325"></span>[3326](#fn_3325.md) Who is slow to chastise and swift
to help, Who suffers not utterly the rod of the wicked to come into the
lot of the righteous, lest the righteous should learn iniquity? <span
id="fr_3326"></span>[3327](#fn_3326.md)   At the end of the contests He
declares the victory of the athlete in a splendid proclamation and lays
bare the secret of his calamities, saying:  “Thinkest thou that I have
dealt with thee for any other purpose than the manifestation of thy
righteousness?” <span id="fr_3327"></span>[3328](#fn_3327.md)   This is the
balm for his wounds, this is the crown of the contest, this the reward
for his patience.  For perhaps his subsequent prosperity was small,
great as it may seem to some, and ordained for the sake of small minds,
even though he received again twice as much as he had lost.

<span id="iii.xi-p79"></span>19.  In this case then it is not wonderful,
if George had the advantage of Athanasius; nay it would be more
wonderful, if the righteous were not tried in the fire of contumely; nor
is this very wonderful, as it would have been had the flames availed for
more than this.  Then he was in retirement, and arranged his exile most
excellently, for he betook himself to the holy and divine homes <span
id="fr_3328"></span>[3329](#fn_3328.md) of contemplation in Egypt, where,
secluding themselves from the world, and welcoming the desert, men live
to God more than all who exist in the body.  Some struggle on in an
utterly monastic and solitary life, speaking to themselves alone and to
God, <span id="fr_3329"></span>[3330](#fn_3329.md) and all the world they
know is what meets their eyes in the desert.  Others, cherishing the law
of love in community, are at once Solitaries and Cœnobites, dead to all
other men and to the eddies of public affairs which whirl us and are
whirled about themselves and make sport of us in their sudden changes,
being the world to one another and whetting the edge of their love in
emulation.  During his intercourse with them, the great Athanasius, who
was always the mediator and reconciler of all other men, like Him Who
made peace through His blood <span id="fr_3330"></span>[3331](#fn_3330.md)
between things which were at variance, reconciled the solitary with the
community life:  by showing that the Priesthood is capable of
contemplation, and that contemplation is in need of a spiritual guide.

<span id="iii.xi-p83"></span>20.  Thus he combined the two, and so <span
id="page_275">p. 275</span> <span id="iii.xi-Page_275"></span>united the
partisans of both calm action and of active calm, as to convince them
that the monastic life is characterised by steadfastness of disposition
rather than by bodily retirement.  Accordingly the great David was a man
of at once the most active and most solitary life, if any one thinks the
verse, I am in solitude, till I pass away, <span
id="fr_3331"></span>[3332](#fn_3331.md) of value and authority in the
exposition of this subject.  Therefore, though they surpass all others
in virtue, they fell further short of his mind than others fell short of
their own, and while contributing little to the perfection of his
priesthood, they gained in return greater assistance in contemplation. 
Whatever he thought, was a law for them, whatever on the contrary he
disapproved, they abjured:  his decisions were to them the tables of
Moses, <span id="fr_3332"></span>[3333](#fn_3332.md) and they paid him more
reverence than is due from men to the Saints.  Aye, and when men came to
hunt the Saint like a wild beast, and, after searching for him
everywhere, failed to find him, they vouchsafed these emissaries not a
single word, and offered their necks to the sword, as risking their
lives for Christ’s sake, and considering the most cruel sufferings on
behalf of Athanasius to be an important step to contemplation, and far
more divine and sublime than the long fasts and hard lying and
mortifications in which they constantly revel.

<span id="iii.xi-p86"></span>21.  Such were his surroundings when he
approved the wise counsel of Solomon that there is a time to every
purpose: <span id="fr_3333"></span>[3334](#fn_3333.md)   so he hid himself
for a while, escaping during the time of war, to show himself when the
time of peace came, as it did soon afterwards.  Meanwhile George, there
being absolutely no one to resist him, overran Egypt, and desolated
Syria, in the might of ungodliness.  He seized upon the East also as far
as he could, ever attracting the weak, as torrents roll down objects in
their course, and assailing the unstable or faint-hearted.  He won over
also the simplicity of the Emperor, for thus I must term his
instability, though I respect his pious motives.  For, to say the truth,
he had zeal, but not according to knowledge. <span
id="fr_3334"></span>[3335](#fn_3334.md)   He purchased those in authority
who were lovers of money rather than lovers of Christ—for he was well
supplied with the funds for the poor, which he embezzled—especially the
effeminate and unmanly men, <span id="fr_3335"></span>[3336](#fn_3335.md)
of doubtful sex, but of manifest impiety; to whom, I know not how or
why, Emperors of the Romans entrusted authority over men, though their
proper function was the charge of women.  In this lay the power of that
servant <span id="fr_3336"></span>[3337](#fn_3336.md) of the wicked one,
that sower of tares, that forerunner of Antichrist; foremost in speech
of the orators of his time among the Bishops; if any one likes to call
him an orator who was not so much an impious, as he was a hostile and
contentious reasoner,—his name I will gladly pass by:  he was the hand
of his party, perverting the truth by the gold subscribed for pious
uses, which the wicked made an instrument of their impiety.

<span id="iii.xi-p91"></span>22.  The crowning feat of this faction was
the council which sat first at Seleucia, the city of the holy and
illustrious virgin Thekla, and afterwards at this mighty city, thus
connecting their names, no longer with noble associations, but with
these of deepest disgrace; whether we must call that council, which
subverted and disturbed everything, a tower of Chalane, <span
id="fr_3337"></span>[3338](#fn_3337.md) which deservedly confounded the
tongues—would that theirs had been confounded for their harmony in
evil!—or a Sanhedrim of Caiaphas <span
id="fr_3338"></span>[3339](#fn_3338.md) where Christ was condemned, or some
other like name.  The ancient and pious doctrine which defended the
Trinity was abolished, by setting up a <span
id="fr_3339"></span>[3340](#fn_3339.md) palisade and battering down the
Consubstantial:  opening the door to impiety by means of what is
written, using as their pretext, their reverence for Scripture and for
the use of approved terms, but really introducing unscriptural
Arianism.  For the phrase “like, according to the Scriptures,” was a
bait to the simple, concealing the hook of impiety, a figure seeming to
look in the direction of all who passed by, a boot fitting either foot,
a winnowing with every wind, <span id="fr_3340"></span>[3341](#fn_3340.md)
gaining authority from the newly written villany and device against the
truth.  For they were wise to do evil, but to do good they had no
knowledge. <span id="fr_3341"></span>[3342](#fn_3341.md)

<span id="iii.xi-p97"></span>23.  Hence came their pretended
condemnation <span id="fr_3342"></span>[3343](#fn_3342.md) of the heretics,
whom they renounced in words, in order to gain plausibility for their
efforts, but in reality furthered; charging them not with unbounded
impiety, but with exaggerated language.  Hence came the profane judges
of the Saints, and the new combination, and public view and discussion
of mysterious questions, and the illegal enquiry into the actions of
life, and the hired informers, and the pur<span id="page_276">p.
276</span> <span id="iii.xi-Page_276"></span>chased sentences.  Some
were unjustly deposed <span id="fr_3343"></span>[3344](#fn_3343.md) from
their sees, others intruded, and among other necessary qualifications,
made to sign the bonds of iniquity:  the ink was ready, the informer at
hand.  This the majority even of us, who were not overcome, had to
endure, not falling in mind, though prevailed upon to sign, <span
id="fr_3344"></span>[3345](#fn_3344.md) and so uniting with men who were in
both respects wicked, and involving ourselves in the smoke, <span
id="fr_3345"></span>[3346](#fn_3345.md) if not in the flame.  Over this I
have often wept, when contemplating the confusion of impiety at that
time, and the persecution of the orthodox teaching which now arose at
the hands of the patrons of the Word.

<span id="iii.xi-p102"></span>24.  For in reality, as the Scripture
says, the shepherds became brutish, <span
id="fr_3346"></span>[3347](#fn_3346.md) and many shepherds destroyed My
vineyard, and defiled my pleasant portion, <span
id="fr_3347"></span>[3348](#fn_3347.md) I mean the Church of God, which has
been gathered together by the sweat and blood of many toilers and
victims both before and after Christ, aye, even the great sufferings of
God for us.  For with very few exceptions, and these either men who from
their insignificance were disregarded, or from their virtue manfully
resisted, being left unto Israel, <span
id="fr_3348"></span>[3349](#fn_3348.md) as was ordained, for a seed and
root, <span id="fr_3349"></span>[3350](#fn_3349.md) to blossom and come to
life again amid the streams of the Spirit, everyone <span
id="fr_3350"></span>[3351](#fn_3350.md) yielded to the influences of the
time, distinguished only by the fact that some did so earlier, some
later, that some became the champions and leaders of impiety, while such
others were assigned a lower rank, as had been shaken by fear, enslaved
by need, fascinated by flattery, or beguiled in ignorance; the last
being the least guilty, if indeed we can allow even this to be a valid
excuse for men entrusted with the leadership of the people.  For just as
the force of lions and other animals, or of men and of women, or of old
and of young men is not the same, but there is a considerable difference
due to age or species—so it is also with rulers and their subjects.  For
while we might pardon laymen in such a case, and often they escape,
because not put to the test, yet how can we excuse a teacher, whose duty
it is, unless he is falsely so-called, to correct the ignorance of
others.  For is it not absurd, while no one, however great his
boorishness and want of education, is allowed to be ignorant of the
Roman law, and while there is no law in favour of sins of ignorance,
that the teachers of the mysteries of salvation should be ignorant of
the first principles of salvation, however simple and shallow their
minds may be in regard to other subjects.  But, even granting indulgence
to them who erred in ignorance, what can be said for the rest, who lay
claim to subtlety of intellect, and yet yielded to the court-party for
the reasons I have mentioned, and after playing the part of piety for a
long while, failed in the hour of trial.

<span id="iii.xi-p108"></span>25.  “Yet once more,” <span
id="fr_3351"></span>[3352](#fn_3351.md) I hear the Scripture say that the
heaven and the earth shall be shaken, inasmuch as this has befallen them
before, signifying, as I suppose, a manifest renovation of all things. 
And we must believe S. Paul when he says <span
id="fr_3352"></span>[3353](#fn_3352.md) that this last shaking is none
other than the second coming of Christ, and the transformation and
changing of the universe to a condition of stability which cannot be
shaken.  And I imagine that this present shaking, in which <span
id="fr_3353"></span>[3354](#fn_3353.md) the contemplatives and lovers of
God, who before the time exercise their heavenly citizenship, are shaken
from us, is of no less consequence than any of former days.  For,
however peaceful and moderate in other respects these men are, yet they
cannot bear to carry their reasonableness so far as to be traitors to
the cause of God for quietness’ sake:  nay on this point they are
excessively warlike and sturdy in fight; such is the heat of their zeal,
that they would sooner proceed to excess in disturbance, than fail to
notice anything that is amiss.  And no small portion of the people is
breaking away with them, flying away, as a flock of birds does, with
those who lead the flight, and even now does not cease to fly with them.

<span id="iii.xi-p112"></span>26.  Such was Athanasius to us, when
present, the pillar of the Church; and such, even when he retired before
the insults of the wicked.  For those who have plotted the capture of
some strong fort, when they see no other easy means of approaching or
taking it, betake themselves to arts, and then, after seducing the
commander by money or guile, without any effort possess themselves of
the stronghold, or, if you will, as those who plotted against Samson
first cut off his hair, <span id="fr_3354"></span>[3355](#fn_3354.md) in
which his strength lay, and then seized upon the judge, and made sport
of him at will, to requite him for his former power:  so did our foreign
foes, after getting rid of our source of strength, and shearing off the
glory of the Church, revel in like manner in utterances and deeds of
impiety.  Then the sup<span id="page_277">p. 277</span> <span
id="iii.xi-Page_277"></span>porter <span
id="fr_3355"></span>[3356](#fn_3355.md) and patron of the hostile
shepherd <span id="fr_3356"></span>[3357](#fn_3356.md) died, crowning <span
id="fr_3357"></span>[3358](#fn_3357.md) his reign, which had not been evil,
with an evil close, and unprofitably repenting, as they say, with his
last breath, when each man, in view of the higher judgement seat, is a
prudent judge of his own conduct.  For of these three evils, which were
unworthy of his reign, he said that he was conscious, the murder of his
kinsmen, the proclamation of the Apostate, and the innovation upon the
faith; and with these words he is said to have departed.  Thus there was
once more authority to teach the word of truth, and those who had
suffered violence had now undisturbed freedom of speech, while jealousy
was whetting the weapons of its wrath.  Thus it was with the people of
Alexandria, who, with their usual impatience of the insolent, could not
brook the excesses of the man, and therefore marked his wickedness by an
unusual death, and his death by an unusual ignominy.  For you know that
camel, <span id="fr_3358"></span>[3359](#fn_3358.md) and its strange
burden, and the new form of elevation, and the first and, I think, the
only procession, with which to this day the insolent are threatened.

<span id="iii.xi-p118"></span>27.  But when from this hurricane of
unrighteousness, this corrupter of godliness, this precursor of the
wicked one, such satisfaction had been exacted, in a way I cannot
praise, for we must consider not what he ought to have suffered, but
what we ought <span id="fr_3359"></span>[3360](#fn_3359.md) to do:  exacted
however it was, as the result of the public anger and excitement:  and
thereupon, our champion was restored from his illustrious banishment,
for so I term his exile on behalf of, and under the blessing of, the
Trinity, amid such delight of the people of the city and of almost all
Egypt, that they ran together from every side, from the furthest limits
of the country, simply to hear the voice of Athanasius, or feast their
eyes upon the sight of him, nay even, as we are told of the Apostles,
that they might be hallowed by the shadow <span
id="fr_3360"></span>[3361](#fn_3360.md) and unsubstantial image of his
body:  so that, many as are the honours, and welcomes bestowed on
frequent occasions in the course of time upon various individuals, not
only upon public rulers and bishops, but also upon the most illustrious
of private citizens, not one has been recorded more numerously attended
or more brilliant than this.  And only one honour can be compared with
it by Athanasius himself, which had been conferred upon him on his
former entrance into the city, when returning from the same exile for
the same reasons.

<span id="iii.xi-p121"></span>28.  With reference to this honour there
was also current some such report as the following; for I will take
leave to mention it, even though it be superfluous, as a kind of
flavouring to my speech, or a flower scattered in honour of his entry. 
After that entry, a certain officer, who had been twice Consul, was
riding into the city; he was one of us, among the most noted of
Cappadocians.  I am sure that you know that I mean Philagrius, who won
upon our affections far beyond any one else, and was honoured as much as
he was loved, if I may thus briefly set forth all his distinctions:  who
had been for a second time entrusted with the government of the city, at
the request of the citizens, by the decision of the Emperor.  Then one
of the common people present, thinking the crowd enormous, like an ocean
whose bound no eye can see, is reported to have said to one of his
comrades and friends—as often happens in such a case—“Tell me, my good
fellow, have you ever before seen the people pour out in such numbers
and so enthusiastically to do honour to any one man?”  “No!” said the
young man, “and I fancy that not even Constantius himself would be so
treated;” indicating, by the mention of the Emperor, the climax of
possible honour.  “Do you speak of that,” said the other with a sweet
and merry laugh, “as something wonderfully great?  I can scarcely
believe that even the great Athanasius would be welcomed like this,”
adding at the same time one of our native oaths in confirmation of his
words.  Now the point of what he said, as I suppose you also plainly
see, is this, that he set the subject of our eulogy before the Emperor
himself.

<span id="iii.xi-p122"></span>29.  So great was the reverence of all for
the man, and so amazing even now seems the reception which I have
described.  For if divided according to birth, age and profession, (and
the city is most usually arranged in this way, when a public honour is
bestowed on anyone) how can I set forth in words that mighty spectacle? 
They formed one river, and it were indeed a poet’s task to describe that
Nile, of really golden stream and rich in crops, flowing back again from
the city to the Chæreum, a day’s journey, I take it, and more.  Permit
me to revel a while longer in <span id="page_278">p. 278</span> <span
id="iii.xi-Page_278"></span>my description:  for I am going there, and
it is not easy to bring back even my words from that ceremony.  He rode
upon a colt, almost, blame me not for folly, as my Jesus did upon that
other colt, <span id="fr_3361"></span>[3362](#fn_3361.md) whether it were
the people of the Gentiles, whom He mounts in kindness, by setting it
free from the bonds of ignorance, or something else, which the Scripture
sets forth.  He was welcomed with branches of trees, and garments with
many flowers and of varied hue were torn off and strewn before him and
under his feet:  there alone was all that was glorious and costly and
peerless treated with dishonour.  Like, once more, to the entry of
Christ were those that went before with shouts and followed with dances;
only the crowd which sung his praises was not of children only, but
every tongue was harmonious, as men contended only to outdo one
another.  I pass by the universal cheers, and the pouring forth of
unguents, and the nightlong festivities, and the whole city gleaming
with light, and the feasting in public and at home, and all the means of
testifying to a city’s joy, which were then in lavish and incredible
profusion bestowed upon him.  Thus did this marvellous man, with such a
concourse, regain his own city.

<span id="iii.xi-p124"></span>30.  He lived then as becomes the rulers
of such a people, but did he fail to teach as he lived?  Were his
contests out of harmony with his teaching?  Were his dangers less than
those of men who have contended for any truth?  Were his honours
inferior to the objects for which he contended?  Did he after his
reception in any way disgrace that reception?  By no means.  Everything
was harmonious, as an air upon a single lyre, and in the same key; his
life, his teaching, his struggles, his dangers, his return, and his
conduct after his return.  For immediately on his restoration to his
Church, he was not like those who are blinded by unrestrained passion,
who, under the dominion of their anger, thrust away or strike at once
whatever comes in their way, even though it might well be spared.  But,
thinking this to be a special time for him to consult his reputation,
since one who is ill-treated is usually restrained, and one who has the
power to requite a wrong is ungoverned, he treated so mildly and gently
those who had injured him, that even they themselves, if I may say so,
did not find his restoration distasteful.

<span id="iii.xi-p125"></span>31.  He cleansed the temple of those who
made merchandise of God, and trafficked in the things of Christ,
imitating Christ <span id="fr_3362"></span>[3363](#fn_3362.md) in this
also; only it was with persuasive words, not with a twisted scourge that
this was wrought.  He reconciled also those who were at variance, both
with one another and with him, without the aid of any coadjutor.  Those
who had been wronged he set free from oppression, making no distinction
as to whether they were of his own or of the opposite party.  He
restored too the teaching which had been overthrown:  the Trinity was
once more boldly spoken of, and set upon the lampstand, flashing with
the brilliant light of the One Godhead into the souls of all.  He
legislated again for the whole world, and brought all minds under his
influence, by letters to some, by invitations to others, instructing
some, who visited him uninvited, and proposing as the single law to
all—*Good will*. <span id="fr_3363"></span>[3364](#fn_3363.md)   For this
alone was able to conduct them to the true issue.  In brief, he
exemplified the virtues of two celebrated stones—for to those who
assailed him he was adamant, and to those at variance a magnet, which by
some secret natural power draws iron to itself, and influences the
hardest of substances.

<span id="iii.xi-p128"></span>32.  But yet it was not likely that envy
could brook all this, or see the Church restored again to the same glory
and health as in former days, by the speedy healing over, as in the
body, of the wounds of separation.  Therefore it was, that he raised up
against Athanasius the Emperor, a rebel like himself, <span
id="fr_3364"></span>[3365](#fn_3364.md) and his peer in villany, inferior
to him only from lack of time, the first of Christian Emperors to rage
against Christ, bringing forth all at once the basilisk of impiety with
which he had long been in labour, when he obtained an opportunity, and
shewing himself, at the time when he was proclaimed Emperor, to be a
traitor to the Emperor who had entrusted him with the empire, and a
traitor double dyed to the God who had saved him.  He devised the most
inhuman of all the persecutions by blending speciousness with cruelty,
in his envy of the honour won by the martyrs in their struggles; and so
he called in question their repute for courage, by making verbal twists
and quibbles a part of his character, or to speak the real truth,
devoting himself to them with an eagerness born of his natural
disposition, and imitating in varied craft the Evil one who dwelt within
him.  The subjugation of the whole race of Christians he thought a
simple task; but found it a great one to overcome Atha<span
id="page_279">p. 279</span> <span id="iii.xi-Page_279"></span>nasius and
the power of his teaching over us.  For he saw that no success could be
gained in the plot against us, because of this man’s resistance and
opposition; the places of the Christians cut down being at once filled
up, surprising though it seems, by the accession of Gentiles and the
prudence of Athanasius.  In full view therefore of this, the crafty
perverter and persecutor, clinging no longer to his cloak of illiberal
sophistry, laid bare his wickedness and openly banished the Bishop from
the city.  For the illustrious warrior must needs conquer in three
struggles <span id="fr_3365"></span>[3366](#fn_3365.md) and thus make good
his perfect title to fame.

<span id="iii.xi-p131"></span>33.  Brief was the interval before Justice
pronounced sentence, and handed over the offender <span
id="fr_3366"></span>[3367](#fn_3366.md) to the Persians:  sending him forth
an ambitious monarch—and bringing him back a corpse for which no one
even felt pity; which, as I have heard, was not allowed to rest in the
grave, but was shaken out and thrown up by the earth which he had
shaken:  a prelude—I take it—to his future chastisement.  Then another
king <span id="fr_3367"></span>[3368](#fn_3367.md) arose, <span
id="fr_3368"></span>[3369](#fn_3368.md) not shameless in countenance like
the former, nor an oppressor of Israel with cruel tasks and taskmasters,
but most pious and gentle.  In order to lay the best of foundations for
his empire, and begin, as is right, by an act of justice, he recalled
from exile all the Bishops, but in the first place him who stood first
in virtue and had conspicuously championed the cause of piety.  Further,
he inquired into the truth of our faith which had been torn asunder,
confused, and parcelled out into various opinions and portions by many;
with the intention, if it were possible, of reducing the whole world to
harmony and union by the co-operation of the Spirit:  and, should he
fail in this, of attaching himself to the best party, so as to aid and
be aided by it, thus giving token of the exceeding loftiness and
magnificence of his ideas on questions of the greatest moment.  Here too
was shown in a very high degree the simple-mindedness of Athanasius, and
the steadfastness of his faith in Christ.  For, when all the rest who
sympathised with us were divided into three parties, and many were
faltering in their conception of the Son, and still more in that of the
Holy Ghost, (a point on which to be only slightly in error was to be
orthodox) and few indeed were sound upon both points, he was the first
and only one, or with the concurrence of but a few, to venture to
confess in writing, with entire clearness and distinctness, the Unity of
Godhead and Essence of the Three Persons, and thus to attain in later
days, under the influence of inspiration, to the same faith in regard to
the Holy Ghost, as had been bestowed at an earlier time on most of the
Fathers in regard to the Son.  This confession, a truly royal and
magnificent gift, he presented to the Emperor, opposing to the unwritten
innovation, a written account <span id="fr_3369"></span>[3370](#fn_3369.md)
the orthodox faith, so that an emperor might be overcome by an emperor,
reason by reason, treatise by treatise.

<span id="iii.xi-p136"></span>34.  This confession was, it seems,
greeted with respect by all, both in West and East, who were capable of
life; some cherishing piety within their own bosoms, if we may credit
what they say, but advancing no further, like a still-born child which
dies within its mother’s womb; others kindling to some extent, as it
were, sparks, so far as to escape the difficulties of the time, arising
either from the more fervent of the orthodox, or the devotion of the
people; while others spoke the truth with boldness, on whose side I
would be, for I dare make no further boast; no longer consulting my own
fearfulness—in other words, the views of men more unsound than myself
(for this we have done enough and to spare, without either gaining
anything from others, or guarding from injury that which was our own,
just as bad stewards do) but bringing forth to light my offspring,
nourishing it with eagerness, and exposing it, in its constant growth,
to the eyes of all.

<span id="iii.xi-p137"></span>35.  This, however, is less admirable than
his conduct.  What wonder that he, who had already made actual ventures
on behalf of the truth, should confess it in writing?  Yet this point I
will add to what has been said, as it seems to me especially wonderful
and cannot with impunity be passed over in a time so fertile in
disagreements as this.  For his action, if we take note of him, will
afford instruction even to the men of this day.  For as, in the case of
one and the same quantity of water, there is separated from it, not only
the residue which is left behind by the hand when drawing it, but also
those drops, once contained in the hand, which trickle out through the
fingers; so also there is a separation between us and, not only those
who hold aloof in their impiety, but also those who are most pious, and
that both in regard to such doctrines as are of small consequence (a
matter of less moment) and also in regard to expressions intended to
bear the same meaning.  We use in an orthodox sense the terms one
Essence and three Hypostases, the one to denote the nature of the
Godhead, the other the properties <span
id="fr_3370"></span>[3371](#fn_3370.md) of the Three; the Italians <span
id="fr_3371"></span>[3372](#fn_3371.md) mean the same, but, owing to the
scantiness of their vocabulary, and its poverty of terms, they are
unable to distinguish between Essence and Hypostases, and therefore
introduce the term Persons, to avoid being understood to assert three
Essences.  The result, were it not piteous, would be laughable.  This
slight difference of sound was taken to indicate a difference of faith. 
Then, Sabellianism was suspected in the doctrine of Three Persons,
Arianism in that of Three Hypostases, both being the offspring of a
contentious spirit.  And then, from the gradual but constant growth of
irritation (the unfailing result of contentiousness) there was a danger
of the whole world being torn asunder in the strife about syllables. 
Seeing and hearing this, our blessed one, true man of God and great
steward of souls as he was, felt it inconsistent with his duty to
overlook so absurd and unreasonable a rending of the word, and applied
his medicine to the disease.  In what manner?  He conferred in his
gentle and sympathetic way with both parties, and after he had carefully
weighed the meaning of their expressions, and found that they had the
same sense, and were in nowise different in doctrine, by permitting each
party to use its own terms, he bound them <span
id="fr_3372"></span>[3373](#fn_3372.md) together in unity of action.

<span id="iii.xi-p141"></span>36.  This in itself was more profitable
than the long course of labours and teaching on which all writers
enlarge, for in it somewhat of ambition mingled, and consequently,
perhaps, somewhat of novelty in expressions.  This again was of more
value than his many vigils and acts of discipline, <span
id="fr_3373"></span>[3374](#fn_3373.md) the advantage of which is limited
to those who perform them.  This was worthy of our hero’s famous
banishments and flights; for the object, in view of which he chose to
endure such sufferings, he still pursued when the sufferings <span
id="page_280">p. 280</span> <span id="iii.xi-Page_280"></span>were
past.  Nor did he cease to cherish the same ardour in others, praising
some, gently rebuking others; rousing the sluggishness of these,
restraining the passion of those; in some cases eager to prevent a fall,
in others devising means of recovery after a fall; simple in
disposition, manifold in the arts of government; clever in argument,
more clever still in mind; condescending to the more lowly, outsoaring
the more lofty; hospitable, <span id="fr_3374"></span>[3375](#fn_3374.md)
protector of suppliants, averted of evils, really combining in himself
alone the whole of the attributes parcelled out by the sons of Greece
among their deities.  Further he was the patron of the wedded and virgin
state alike, both peaceable and a peacemaker, and attendant upon those
who are passing from hence.  Oh, how many a title does his virtue afford
me, if I would detail its many-sided excellence.

<span id="iii.xi-p144"></span>37.  After such a course, as taught and
teacher, that his life and habits form the ideal of an Episcopate, and
his teaching the law of orthodoxy, what reward does he win for his
piety?  It is not indeed right to pass this by.  In a good old age he
closed his life, <span id="fr_3375"></span>[3376](#fn_3375.md) and was
gathered to his fathers, the Patriarchs, and Prophets, and Apostles, and
Martyrs, who contended for the truth.  To be brief in my epitaph, the
honours at his departure surpassed even those of his return from exile;
the object of many tears, his glory, stored up in the minds of all,
outshines all its visible tokens.  Yet, O thou dear and holy one, who
didst thyself, with all thy fair renown, so especially illustrate the
due proportions of speech and of silence, do thou stay here my words,
falling short as they do of thy true meed of praise, though they have
claimed the full exercise of all my powers.  And mayest thou cast upon
us from above a propitious glance, and conduct this people in its
perfect worship of the perfect Trinity, which, as Father, Son, Holy
Ghost, we contemplate and adore.  And mayest thou, if my lot be
peaceful, possess and aid me in my pastoral charge, or if it pass
through struggles, uphold me, or take me to thee, and set me with
thyself and those like thee (though I have asked a great thing) in
Christ Himself, our Lord, to whom be all glory, honour, and power for
evermore.  Amen.
