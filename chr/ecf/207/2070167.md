<span id="iv.iv.viii.iv-p2"></span>(Gregory put a collection of Basil’s
letters with his own, and gave them the first place.  Nicobulus seems to
have been surprised at this, and asked the reason.  Gregory explains as
follows.)

<span id="iv.iv.viii.iv-p3"></span>I have always preferred the Great
Basil to myself, though he was of the contrary opinion; and so I do now,
not less for truth’s sake than for friendship’s.  This is the reason why
I have given his letters the first place and my own the second.  For I
hope we two will always be coupled together; and also I would supply
others with an example of modesty and submission.
