id="iv.iv.iii.v-p1.1"></span>Ep. LXVI.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.iii.v-p2"></span>(The following letter is sometimes
attributed to Basil, and is found in his works as well as in those of
Gregory.  The <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.iii.v-p2.1"></span>mss.</span> however, with only a single
exception, give it to the latter.)

<span id="iv.iv.iii.v-p3"></span>You give me pleasure both by writing
and remembering me, and a much greater pleasure by sending me your
blessing in your letter.  But if I were worthy of your sufferings and of
your conflicts for Christ and through Christ I should have been counted
worthy also to come to you, to embrace Your Piety, and to take example
by your patience in your sufferings.  But since I am not worthy of this,
being troubled with many afflictions and hindrances I do what is next
best.  I address Your Perfection, and I beg you not to be weary of
remembering me.  For to be deemed worthy of your letters is not only
profitable to me, but is also a matter to boast of to many people, and
is an honour, because I am considered by a man of so great virtue, and
such near relations with God, that he can bring others also by word and
example into relation to Him.
