id="iv.iv.viii.iii-p1.1"></span>Ep. LII.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.viii.iii-p2"></span>(Nicobulus asked Gregory to publish
a collection of his letters.  Gregory forwards a copy.)

<span id="iv.iv.viii.iii-p3"></span>You are asking flowers from an
autumn meadow, and arming Nestor in his old age, in demanding from me
now something clever in the way of language, after I have long neglected
all that is enjoyable in language and in life.  But yet (since it is not
an Eurysthean or Herculean labour that you are imposing on me, but
rather one which is very agreeable and quiet, to collect for you as many
of my own letters as I can), do you place this volume among your books—a
work not amatory but oratorical, and not for display so much as for use,
and that for our own home. <span id="fr_4779"></span>[4780](#fn_4779)  
For different authors have different characteristics, greater or
smaller.  Mine is a tendency to instruct by maxims and positive
statements wherever opportunity occurs.  And as in a legitimate child,
so also in language, the father is always visible, not less than parents
are shewn by bodily characteristics.  Mine are such as I have
mentioned.  You may repay me both by writing and by deriving profit from
what I have written.  I cannot ask for or request any better reward than
this, either more profitable to the asker, or more becoming him who
gives it.
