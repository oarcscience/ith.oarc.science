<span id="iv.iv.v.vii-p2"></span>(The Armenian referred to is probably
Eustathius Bishop of Sebaste, the capital of Armenia Minor.  He had been
a disciple of Arius, but more than once professed the Nicene Faith,
changing his opinions with his company.  His personal character however
stood very high, and for a long time S. Basil regarded him with
affectionate esteem.  Indeed S. Basil’s Rule for Monks is based on one
drawn up by him.  But after Basil’s elevation to the Episcopate
Eustathius began to oppose him and to calumniate him on all sides, and
even entered openly into communion with the Arians.  It would seem that
this man tried to get Amphilochius round to his side, and through him
Gregory.)

<span id="iv.iv.v.vii-p3"></span>The Injunction of your inimitable
Honour is not barbaric, but Greek, or rather christian; but as for the
Armenian on whom you pride yourself so, he is a downright barbarian, and
far from our honour.
