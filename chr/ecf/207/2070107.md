id="iv.iv.i.iii-p1.1"></span>Ep. XXIII.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.i.iii-p2"></span>Do not be surprized if I ask of you a
great favour; for it is from a great man that I am asking it, and the
request must be measured by him of whom it is made; for it is equally
absurd to ask great things from a small man, and small things from a
great man, the one being unseasonable, and the other mean.  I therefore
present to you with my own hand my most precious son Amphilochius, a man
so famous (even beyond his years) for his gentlemanly bearing, that I
myself, though an old man, and a Priest, and your friend, would be quite
content to be as much esteemed.  What wonder is it if he was cheated by
a man’s pretended friendship, and did not suspect the swindle?  For not
being himself a rogue, he did not suspect roguery, but thought that
correction of language rather than of character was what was wanted, and
therefore entered into partnership with him in business.  What blame can
attach to him for this with honest men?  Do not then allow wickedness to
get the better of virtue; and do not dishonour my grey hairs, but do
honour to my testimony, and add your kindness to my benedictions, which
are perhaps of some account with God before Whom we stand.
