<span id="iv.iv.ii.vi-p2"></span>You are distressed by your travels, and
think yourself unsteady, like a stick carried along by a stream.  But,
my dear friend, you must not let yourself feel so at all.  For the
travels of the stick are involuntary, but your course is ordained by
God, and your stability is in doing good to others, even though you are
not fixed to a place; unless indeed one ought to find fault with the
sun, for going about the world scattering his rays, and giving life to
all things on which he shines; or, while praising the fixed stars, one
should revile the planets, whose very wandering is harmonious.
