id="iv.iv.iv.v-p1.1"></span>Ep. XXXIX.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.iv.v-p2"></span>(About the same date.  A recommendation
of one Amazonius, whose learning was much respected by Gregory.)

<span id="iv.iv.iv.v-p3"></span>I wish well to all my friends.  And when
I speak of friends, I mean honourable and good men, linked with me in
virtue, if indeed I myself have any claim to it.  Therefore at <span
id="page_466">p. 466</span> <span id="iv.iv.iv.v-Page_466"></span>the
present time when seeking how I might do a kindness to my excellent
brother Amazonius (for I was very much pleased with the man in some
intercourse which has lately taken place between us), I thought I might
return him one favour for all,—in your friendship and protection.  For
in a short time he shewed proof of an extensive education, both of the
kind which I used once to be very zealous for, when I was shortsighted,
and of that for which I am zealous in its place since I have been able
to contemplate the summit of virtue.  Whether I in my turn have appeared
to him to be worth anything in respect of virtue is his affair.  At any
rate I shewed him the best things I have, namely, my friends to him as
my friend.  Of these I reckon you as the first and truest, and want you
to shew yourself so to him—as your common Country demands, and my desire
and promise begs; for I promised him your patronage in return for all
his kindness.
