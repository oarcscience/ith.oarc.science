id="iv.iv.vii.viii-p1.1"></span>Ep. CLIII.  To Bosporius, Bishop of
Colonia.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.vii.viii-p2"></span>(S. Gregory had to carry out his
threat.  He resigned the care of Nazianzus, and nothing would induce him
to withdraw his resignation.  Bosporius wrote him an urgent letter with
this object, but he replied as follows:)

<span id="iv.iv.vii.viii-p3"></span>Twice I have been tripped up by you,
and have been deceived (you know what I mean), and, if it was justly,
may the Lord smell from you an odour of sweet savour; <span
id="fr_4771"></span>[4772](#fn_4771.md) if unjustly, may the Lord pardon
it.  For so it is reasonable for me to speak of you, seeing we are
commanded to be patient when injuries are inflicted on us.  But as you
are master of your own opinions, so am I of mine.  That troublesome
Gregory will no longer be troublesome to you.  I will withdraw myself to
God, Who alone is pure and guileless.  I will retire into myself.  This
I have determined; for to stumble twice on the same stone is attributed
by the proverb to fools alone.
