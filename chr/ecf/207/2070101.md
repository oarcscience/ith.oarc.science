id="iv.iii.xxii-p1.1"></span>Ep. LIX.  To Basil.</span>

<span id="iv.iii.xxii-p2"></span>(The reply to Basil’s somewhat angry
answer to the last.)

<span id="iv.iii.xxii-p3"></span>This was a case which any wiser man
would have foreseen; but I who am very simple and foolish did not fear
it in writing to you.  My letter grieved you; but in my opinion neither
rightly nor justly, but quite unreasonably.  And whilst you did not
acknowledge that you were hurt, neither did you conceal it, or if you
did it was with great skill, as with a mask, hiding your vexation under
an appearance of respect.  But as to myself if I acted in this
deceitfully or maliciously, I shall be punished not more by your
vexation than by the truth itself; but if in simplicity and with my
accustomed goodwill, I will lay the blame on my own sins rather than on
your temper.  But it would have been better to have set this matter
straight, rather than to be angry with those who offer you counsel.  But
you must see to your own affairs, inasmuch as you are quite capable of
giving the same advice to others.  You may look upon me as very ready,
if God will, both to come to you, and to join you in the conflict, and
to contribute all that I can.  For who would flinch, who would not
rather take courage in speaking and contending for the truth under you
and by your side?
