<span id="iv.iv.vii.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.iv.vii.xii-p1.1"></span>Ep. CXXXIX.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xii-p2"></span>(This letter is written at a somewhat
earlier date in reference to the consent he had been induced to give to
remaining for some time longer as administrator of the See of
Nazianzus.  It is certainly not addressed to Theodore of Tyana, and it
is not known who this Theodore is.)

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xii-p3"></span>He Who raised David His servant from
the Shepherd’s work to the Throne, and Your Reverence from the flock to
the Work of the Shepherd:  He that orders our affairs and those of all
who hope in Him according to His own Will:  may He now put it into the
mind of Your Reverence to know the dishonour which I have suffered at
the hands of my Lords the Bishops in the matter of their votes, in that
they have agreed to the Election, <span
id="fr_4774"></span>[4775](#fn_4774.md) but have excluded us.  I will not
lay the blame on Your Reverence, because you have but recently come to
preside over our affairs, and are, as is to be expected, for the most
part unacquainted with our history.  This is quite enough:  for I have
no mind to trouble you further, that I may not seem burdensome at the
very beginning of our friendship.  But I will tell you what suggests
itself to me in taking counsel with God.  I retired from the Church at
Nazianzus, not as either despising God, or looking down on the
littleness of the flock (God forbid that a philosophic <span
id="fr_4775"></span>[4776](#fn_4775) soul should be so disposed.md); but
first because I am not bound by any such appointment:  and secondly
because I am broken down by my ill health, and do not think myself equal
to such anxieties.  And since you too have been heavy on me, in
reproaching me with my resignation, and I myself could not endure the
clamours against me, and since the times are hard, threatening us with
an inroad of enemies to the injury of the commonwealth of the whole
Church, I finally made up my mind to suffer a defeat which is painful to
my body, but perhaps not <span id="page_476">p. 476</span> <span
id="iv.iv.vii.xii-Page_476"></span>bad for my soul.  I make over this
miserable body to the Church for as long as it may be possible, thinking
it better to suffer any distress to the flesh rather than to incur a
spiritual injury myself or to inflict it upon others, who have thought
the worst of us, judging from their own experience.  Knowing this, do
pray for me, and approve my resolution:  and perhaps it is not out of
place to say, mould yourself to piety.
