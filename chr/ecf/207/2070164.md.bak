<span id="iv.iv.viii.i-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.iv.viii.i-p1.1"></span>§8. To Nicobulus.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.viii.i-p2"></span>(See the introduction to the first
letter to Sophronius above.)

<span id="iv.iv.viii.i-p3"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="iv.iv.viii.i-p3.1"></span>Ep. XII.  (About <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.viii.i-p3.2"></span>a.d.</span> 365).</span>

<span id="iv.iv.viii.i-p4"></span>You joke me about Alypiana as being
little and unworthy of your size, you tall and immense and monstrous
fellow both in form and strength.  For now I understand that soul is a
matter of measure, and virtue of weight, and that rocks are more
valuable than pearls, and crows more respectable than nightingales. 
Well, well! rejoice in your bigness and your cubits, and be in no
respect inferior to the famed sons of Aloeus. <span
id="fr_4776"></span>[4777](#fn_4776.md)   You ride a horse, and shake a
spear, and concern yourself with wild beasts.  But she has no such work;
and no great strength is needed to carry a comb, <span
id="fr_4777"></span>[4778](#fn_4777.md) or to handle a distaff, or to sit
by a loom, “For such is the glory of woman.” <span
id="fr_4778"></span>[4779](#fn_4778.md)   And if you add this, that she has
become fixed to the ground on account of prayer, and by the great
movement of her mind has constant communion with God, what is there here
to boast of in your bigness or the stature of your body?  Take heed to
seasonable silence:  listen to her voice:  mark her unadornment, her
womanly virility, her usefulness at home, her love of her husband.  Then
you will say with the Laconian, that verily soul is not a subject for
measure, and the outer must look to the inner man.  If you look at the
things in this way you will leave off joking and deriding her as little,
and you will congratulate yourself on your marriage.
