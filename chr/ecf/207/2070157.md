<span id="iv.iv.vii.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.iv.vii.vii-p1.1"></span>Ep. CLII.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.vii.vii-p2"></span>(On his retirement from
Constantinople Gregory had at the request of the Bishops of the
Province, and especially of Theodore of Tyana the Metropolitan, and
Bosporius Bishop of Colonia (see letters above) and at the earnest
solicitation of the people, undertaken the charge of the Diocese of
Nazianzus; but he very soon found that his health was not equal to so
great a task, and that he could not fulfil its calls upon him.  He
struggled on for some time, but at length, finding himself quite unequal
to it, he wrote as follows to the Metropolitan:)

<span id="iv.iv.vii.vii-p3"></span>It is time for me to use these words
of Scripture, To whom shall I cry when I am wronged? <span
id="fr_4768"></span>[4769](#fn_4768)   Who will stretch out a hand to me
when I am oppressed?  To whom shall the burden of this Church pass, in
its present evil and paralysed condition?  I protest before God and the
Elect Angels that the Flock of God is being unrighteously dealt with in
being left without a Shepherd or a Bishop, through my being laid on the
shelf.  For I am a prisoner to my ill health and have been very quickly
removed thereby from the Church, and made quite useless to everybody,
every day breathing my last, and getting more and more crushed by my
duties.  If the Province had any other head, it would have been my duty
to cry out and protest to it continually.  But since Your Reverence is
the Superior, it is to you I must look.  For, to leave out everything
else, you shall learn from my fellow-priests, Eulalius the
Chorepiscopus <span id="fr_4769"></span>[4770](#fn_4769) and Celeusius,
whom I have specially sent to Your Reverence, what these robbers <span
id="fr_4770"></span>[4771](#fn_4770) who have now got the upper hand,
are both doing and threatening.  To repress them is not in the power of
my weakness, but belongs to your skill and strength; since to you, with
His other gifts God has given that of strength also for the protection
of His Church.  If in saying and writing this I cannot get a hearing, I
shall take the only course remaining to me, that of publicly proclaiming
and making known that this Church needs a Bishop, in order that it may
not be injured by my feeble health.  What is to follow is matter for
your consideration.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.vii-p5"></span> Chorepiscopi;—a grade of clergy
called into existence in the latter part of the Third Century, first in
Asia Minor, to meet the difficulty of providing Episcopal supervision in
the country districts of large Dioceses.  They seemed to have been
allowed to confer the Minor, but not the Holy Orders, unless by special
commission from the Diocesan, on the ground of their lack of original
Jurisdiction.  That they were originally possessed of full Episcopal
Orders there can be no doubt, but eventually the position was allowed to
be held by Priests, and in the West the office became practically merged
in that of the Archdeacon.
