id="iv.iv.vi.v-p1.1"></span>Ep. CLXXXVI.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.vi.v-p2"></span>(A letter of introduction for a
relative.)

<span id="iv.iv.vi.v-p3"></span>What would you have done if I had come
in person and taken up your time?  I am quite certain you would have
undertaken with all <span id="page_471">p. 471</span> <span
id="iv.iv.vi.v-Page_471"></span>zeal to deliver me from the slander, if
I may take as a token what has happened before.  Do me this favour,
then, through my most discreet kinswoman who approaches you through me,
reverencing first the age of your petitioner, and next her disposition
and piety, which is more than is ordinarily found in a woman; and
besides this, her ignorance in business-matters, and the troubles now
brought upon her by her own relations; and above all, my entreaty.  The
greatest favour you can do me is speed in the benefit for which I am
asking.  For even the unjust judge in the Gospel <span
id="fr_4750"></span>[4751](#fn_4750.md) shewed kindness to the widow,
though only after long beseeching and importunity.  But from you I ask
for speed, that she may not be overwhelmed by being long burdened with
anxieties and miseries in a foreign land; though I know quite well that
Your Piety will make that alien land to be a fatherland to her.
