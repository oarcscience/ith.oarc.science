<p class="c23"><a name="iv.iv.iv.v-p2"></A>(About the same date.&#160; A recommendation of one Amazonius, whose learning was much respected by Gregory.)</p>  
<p class="c23"><a name="iv.iv.iv.v-p3"></A>I wish well to all my friends.&#160; And when I speak of friends, I mean honourable and good men, linked with me in virtue, if indeed I myself have any claim to it.&#160; Therefore at <A NAME="page_466"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 466</FONT></A> <a name="iv.iv.iv.v-Page_466"></A>the present time when seeking how I might do a kindness to my excellent brother Amazonius (for I was very much pleased with the man in some intercourse which has lately taken place between us), I thought I might return him one favour for all,&#8212;in your friendship and protection.&#160; For in a short time he shewed proof of an extensive education, both of the kind which I used once to be very zealous for, when I was shortsighted, and of that for which I am zealous in its place since I have been able to contemplate the summit of virtue.&#160; Whether I in my turn have appeared to him to be worth anything in respect of virtue is his affair.&#160; At any rate I shewed him the best things I have, namely, my friends to him as my friend.&#160; Of these I reckon you as the first and truest, and want you to shew yourself so to him&#8212;as your common Country demands, and my desire and promise begs; for I promised him your patronage in return for all his kindness.</p>
