<span id="ii.xiv-p2"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="ii.xiv-p2.1"></span>On the Clause, and in One Lord Jesus Christ,
with a Reading from the</span> [1 Cor.
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#005.md),
[6](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#006.md)<span id="ii.xiv-p2.2"></span>

<span id="ii.xiv-p3"></span>*For though there be that are called gods,
whether in heaven or on earth* <span
id="fr_1113"></span>[1114](#fn_1113.md) *; yet to us there is One God, the
Father, of whom are all things, and we in Him; and One Lord Jesus
Christ, through whom are all things, and we through Him.*

<span id="ii.xiv-p5"></span>1.  <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.xiv-p5.1"></span>They</span> who have been taught to believe
“<span class="sc"><span id="ii.xiv-p5.2"></span>In One God the Father
Almighty</span>,” ought also to believe in His Only-begotten Son.  For
*he that denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father* <span
id="fr_1114"></span>[1115](#fn_1114.md) .  *I am the Door* <span
id="fr_1115"></span>[1116](#fn_1115.md) , saith Jesus; *no one cometh unto
the Father but through Me* <span id="fr_1116"></span>[1117](#fn_1116.md) . 
For if thou deny the Door, the knowledge concerning the Father is shut
off from thee.  *No man knoweth the father, save the Son, and he to
whomsoever the Son shall reveal Him* <span
id="fr_1117"></span>[1118](#fn_1117.md) .  For if thou deny Him who
reveals, thou remainest in ignorance.  There is a sentence in the
Gospels, saying, *He that believeth not on the Son, shall not see life;
but the wrath of God abideth on him.* <span
id="fr_1118"></span>[1119](#fn_1118.md)   For the Father hath indignation
when the Only-begotten Son is set at nought.  For it is grievous to a
king that merely his soldier should be dishonoured; and when one of his
nobler officers or friends is dishonoured, then his anger is greatly
increased:  but if any should do despite to the king’s only-begotten son
himself, who shall appease the father’s indignation on behalf of his
only-begotten son?

<span id="ii.xiv-p11"></span>2.  If, therefore, any one wishes to shew
piety towards God, let him worship the Son, since otherwise the Father
accepts not his service.  The Father spake with a loud voice from
heaven, saying, *This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well
pleased* <span id="fr_1119"></span>[1120](#fn_1119.md) .  The Father was
well pleased; unless thou also be well pleased in Him, thou hast not
life.  Be not thou carried away with the Jews when they craftily say,
There is one God alone; but with the knowledge that God is One, know
that there is also an Only-begotten Son of God.  I am not the first to
say this, but the Psalmist in the person of the Son saith, *The Lord
said unto Me, Thou art My Son* <span
id="fr_1120"></span>[1121](#fn_1120.md) .  Heed not therefore what the Jews
say, but what the Prophets say.  Dost thou wonder that they who stoned
and slew the Prophets, set at nought the Prophets’ words?

<span id="ii.xiv-p14"></span>3.  Believe thou <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.xiv-p14.1"></span>In One Lord Jesus Christ, the Only-Begotten Son
of God</span>.  For we say “One Lord Jesus Christ,” that His Sonship may
be “Only-begotten:”  we say “One,” that thou mayest not suppose
another:  we say “One,” that thou mayest not profanely diffuse the many
names <span id="fr_1121"></span>[1122](#fn_1121.md) of His action among
many sons.  For He is called a Door <span
id="fr_1122"></span>[1123](#fn_1122.md) ; but take not the name literally
for a thing of wood, but a spiritual, a living Door, discriminating
those who enter in.  He is called a Way <span
id="fr_1123"></span>[1124](#fn_1123.md) , not one trodden by feet, but
leading to the Father in heaven; He is called a Sheep <span
id="fr_1124"></span>[1125](#fn_1124.md) , not an irrational one, but the
one which through its precious blood cleanses the world from its sins,
which is led before the shearers, and knows when to be silent.  This
Sheep again is called a Shepherd, who says, *I am the Good
Shepherd* <span id="fr_1125"></span>[1126](#fn_1125.md) :  a Sheep because
of His manhood, a Shepherd because of the loving-kindness of His
Godhead.  And wouldst thou know that there are rational sheep? the
Saviour says to the Apostles, *Behold, I send you as sheep in the midst
of wolves* <span id="fr_1126"></span>[1127](#fn_1126.md) .  Again, He is
called a Lion <span id="fr_1127"></span>[1128](#fn_1127.md) , not as a
devourer of men, but indicating as it were by the title His kingly, and
stedfast, and confident nature:  a Lion He is also called in opposition
to the lion our adver<span id="page_58">p. 58</span> <span
id="ii.xiv-Page_58"></span>sary, who roars and devours those who have
been deceived <span id="fr_1128"></span>[1129](#fn_1128.md) .  For the
Saviour came, not as having changed the gentleness of His own nature,
but as the strong *Lion of the tribe of Judah* <span
id="fr_1129"></span>[1130](#fn_1129.md) , saving them that believe, but
treading down the adversary.  He is called a Stone, not a lifeless
stone, cut out by men’s hands, but a *chief corner-stone* <span
id="fr_1130"></span>[1131](#fn_1130.md) , on whom *whosoever believeth
shall not be put to shame*.

<span id="ii.xiv-p25"></span>4.  He is called <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.xiv-p25.1"></span>Christ</span>, not as having been anointed by
men’s hands, but eternally anointed by the Father to His High-Priesthood
on behalf of men <span id="fr_1131"></span>[1132](#fn_1131.md) .  He is
called Dead, not as having abode among the dead, as all in Hades, but as
being alone *free among the dead* <span
id="fr_1132"></span>[1133](#fn_1132.md) .  He is called Son of Man, not as
having had His generation from earth, as each of us, but as coming upon
the clouds <span class="sc"><span id="ii.xiv-p27.2"></span>To Judge Both
Quick and Dead <span id="fr_1133"></span>[1134](#fn_1133.md) </span>.  He
is called <span class="sc"><span id="ii.xiv-p28.2"></span>Lord</span>,
not improperly as those who are so called among men, but as having a
natural and eternal Lordship <span id="fr_1134"></span>[1135](#fn_1134.md)
.  He is called <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.xiv-p29.1"></span>Jesus</span> by a fitting name, as having the
appellation from His salutary healing.  He is called <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.xiv-p29.2"></span>Son</span>, not as advanced by
adoption, but as naturally begotten.  And many are the titles of our
Saviour; lest, therefore, His manifold appellations should make thee
think of many sons, and because of the errors of the heretics, who say
that Christ is one, and Jesus another, and the Door another, and so
on <span id="fr_1135"></span>[1136](#fn_1135.md) , the Faith secures thee
beforehand, saying well, <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.xiv-p30.1"></span>In One Lord Jesus Christ</span>:  for though
the titles are many, yet their subject is one.

<span id="ii.xiv-p31"></span>5.  But the Saviour comes in various forms
to each man for his profit <span id="fr_1136"></span>[1137](#fn_1136.md) . 
For to those who have need of gladness He becomes a Vine; and to those
who want to enter in He stands as a Door; and to those who need to offer
up their prayers He stands a mediating High Priest.  Again, to those who
have sins He becomes a Sheep, that He may be sacrificed for them.  *He
is made all things to all men* <span
id="fr_1137"></span>[1138](#fn_1137.md) , remaining in His own nature what
He is.  For so remaining, and holding the dignity of His Sonship in
reality unchangeable, He adapts Himself to our infirmities, just as some
excellent physician or compassionate teacher; though He is Very Lord,
and received not the Lordship by advancement <span
id="fr_1138"></span>[1139](#fn_1138.md) , but has the dignity of His
Lordship from nature, and is not called Lord improperly <span
id="fr_1139"></span>[1140](#fn_1139.md) , as we are, but is so in verity,
since by the Father’s bidding <span id="fr_1140"></span>[1141](#fn_1140.md)
He is Lord of His own works.  For our lordship is over men of equal
rights and like passions, nay often over our elders, and often a young
master rules over aged servants.  But in the case of our Lord Jesus
Christ the Lordship is not so:  but He is first Maker, then Lord <span
id="fr_1141"></span>[1142](#fn_1141.md) :  first He made all things by the
Father’s will, then, He is Lord of the things which were made by Him.

<span id="ii.xiv-p42"></span>6.  *Christ the Lord* is He who was *born
in the city of David* <span id="fr_1142"></span>[1143](#fn_1142.md) .  And
wouldest thou know <span id="page_59">p. 59</span> <span
id="ii.xiv-Page_59"></span>that Christ is Lord with the Father even
before His Incarnation <span id="fr_1143"></span>[1144](#fn_1143.md) , that
thou mayest not only accept the statement by faith, but mayest also
receive proof from the Old Testament?  Go to the first book, Genesis: 
God saith, *Let us make man*, not ‘in My image,’ but, *in Our
image* <span id="fr_1144"></span>[1145](#fn_1144.md) .  And after Adam was
made, the sacred writer says, *And God created man; in the image of God
created He him* <span id="fr_1145"></span>[1146](#fn_1145.md) .  For he did
not limit the dignity of the Godhead to the Father alone, but included
the Son also:  that it might be shewn that man is not only the work of
God, but also of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is Himself also Very God. 
This Lord, who works together with the Father, wrought with Him also in
the case of Sodom, according to the Scripture:  *And the Lord rained
upon Sodom and Gomorrah fire and brimstone from the Lord out of
heaven* <span id="fr_1146"></span>[1147](#fn_1146.md) .  This Lord is He
who afterwards was seen of Moses, as much as he was able to see.  For
the Lord is loving unto man, ever condescending to our infirmities.

<span id="ii.xiv-p48"></span>7.  Moreover, that you may be sure that
this is He who was seen of Moses, hear Paul’s testimony, when he says,
*For they all drank of a spiritual rock that followed them; and the rock
was Christ* <span id="fr_1147"></span>[1148](#fn_1147.md) .  And again: 
*By faith Moses forsook Egypt* <span
id="fr_1148"></span>[1149](#fn_1148.md) , and shortly after he says,
*accounting the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in
Egypt* <span id="fr_1149"></span>[1150](#fn_1149.md) .  This Moses says to
Him, *Shew me Thyself*.  Thou seest that the Prophets also in those
times saw the Christ, that is, as far as each was able.*  Shew me
Thyself, that I may see Thee with understanding* <span
id="fr_1150"></span>[1151](#fn_1150.md) .  But He saith, *There shall no
man see My face, and live* <span id="fr_1151"></span>[1152](#fn_1151.md) . 
For this reason then, because no man could see the face of the Godhead
and live, He took on Him the face of human nature, that we might see
this and live.  And yet when He wished to shew even that with a little
majesty, when *His face did shine as the sun* <span
id="fr_1152"></span>[1153](#fn_1152.md) , the disciples fell down
affrighted.  If then His bodily countenance, shining not in the full
power of Him that wrought, but according to the capacity of the
Disciples, affrighted them, so that even thus they could not bear it,
how could any man gaze upon the majesty of the Godhead?  ‘A great
thing,’ saith the Lord, ‘thou desirest, O Moses:  and I approve thine
insatiable desire, *and I will do this thing* <span
id="fr_1153"></span>[1154](#fn_1153.md) for thee, but according as thou art
able.  *Behold, I will put thee in the clift of the rock* <span
id="fr_1154"></span>[1155](#fn_1154.md) :  for as being little, thou shalt
lodge in a little space.’

<span id="ii.xiv-p57"></span>8.  Now here I wish you to make safe what I
am going to say, because of the Jews.  For our object is to prove that
the Lord Jesus Christ was with the Father.  The <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.xiv-p57.1"></span>Lord</span> then says to Moses, *I will pass by
before thee with My glory, and will proclaim the name of the <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.xiv-p57.2"></span>Lord</span> before thee* <span
id="fr_1155"></span>[1156](#fn_1155.md) .  Being Himself the <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.xiv-p58.3"></span>Lord</span>, what <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.xiv-p58.4"></span>Lord</span> doth He proclaim? 
Thou seest how He was covertly teaching the godly doctrine of the Father
and the Son.  And again, in what follows it is written word for word: 
*And the <span class="sc"><span id="ii.xiv-p58.5"></span>Lord</span>
descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the
name of the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.xiv-p58.6"></span>Lord</span>.  And the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.xiv-p58.7"></span>Lord</span> passed by before him, and
proclaimed, The <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.xiv-p58.8"></span>Lord</span>, the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.xiv-p58.9"></span>Lord</span> God, merciful and gracious,
long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, both keeping
righteousness and shewing mercy unto thousands, taking away iniquities,
and transgressions, and sins* <span id="fr_1156"></span>[1157](#fn_1156.md)
.  Then in what follows, *Moses bowed his head and worshipped* <span
id="fr_1157"></span>[1158](#fn_1157.md) before the Lord who proclaimed the
Father, and said:  Go Thou then, O Lord, in the midst of us <span
id="fr_1158"></span>[1159](#fn_1158.md) .

<span id="ii.xiv-p62"></span>9.  This is the first proof:  receive now a
second plain one.  *The <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.xiv-p62.1"></span>Lord</span> said unto my Lord, sit Thou on My
right hand* <span id="fr_1159"></span>[1160](#fn_1159.md) .  The <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.xiv-p63.3"></span>Lord</span> says this to the
Lord, not to a servant, but to the Lord of all, and His own Son, to whom
He put all things in subjection.  *But when He saith that all things are
put under Him, it is manifest that He is excepted, which did put all
things under Him*, and what follows; *that God may be all in all* <span
id="fr_1160"></span>[1161](#fn_1160.md) .  The Only-begotten Son is Lord of
all, but the obedient Son of the Father, for He grasped not the
Lordship <span id="fr_1161"></span>[1162](#fn_1161.md) , but received it by
nature of the Father’s own will.  For neither did the Son grasp it, nor
the Father grudge to impart it.  He it is who saith, *All things are
delivered unto Me of My Father* <span
id="fr_1162"></span>[1163](#fn_1162.md) ; “delivered unto Me, not as though
<span id="page_60">p. 60</span> <span id="ii.xiv-Page_60"></span>I had
them not before; and I keep them well, not robbing Him who hath given
them.”

<span id="ii.xiv-p68"></span>10.  The Son of God then is Lord:  He is
Lord, who was born in Bethlehem of Judæa, according to the Angel who
said to the shepherds, *I bring you good tidings of great joy, that unto
you is born this day in the city of David Christ the Lord* <span
id="fr_1163"></span>[1164](#fn_1163.md) :  of whom an Apostle says
elsewhere, *The word which God sent unto the children of Israel,
preaching the gospel of peace by Jesus Christ:  He is Lord of all* <span
id="fr_1164"></span>[1165](#fn_1164.md) .  But when he says, *of all*, do
thou except nothing from His Lordship:  for whether Angels, or
Archangels, or principalities, or powers, or any created thing named by
the Apostles, all are under the Lordship of the Son.  Of Angels He is
Lord, as thou hast it in the Gospels, *Then the Devil departed from Him,
and the Angels came and ministered unto Him* <span
id="fr_1165"></span>[1166](#fn_1165.md) ; for the Scripture saith not, they
succoured Him, but they *ministered unto Him*, that is, like servants. 
When He was about to be born of a Virgin, Gabriel was then His servant,
having received His service as a peculiar dignity.  When He was about to
go into Egypt, that He might overthrow the gods of Egypt made with
hands <span id="fr_1166"></span>[1167](#fn_1166.md) , again *an Angel
appeareth to Joseph in a dream* <span
id="fr_1167"></span>[1168](#fn_1167.md) .  After He had been crucified, and
had risen again, an Angel brought the good tidings, and as a trustworthy
servant said to the women, *Go, tell His disciples that He is risen, and
goeth before you into Galilee; lo, I have told you* <span
id="fr_1168"></span>[1169](#fn_1168.md) :  almost as if he had said, “I
have not neglected my command, I protest that I have told you; that if
ye disregard it, the blame may not be on me, but on those who disregard
it.”  This then is the One Lord Jesus Christ, of whom the lesson just
now read speaks:  *For though there be many that are called gods,
whether in heaven or in earth*, and so on, *yet to us there is One God,
the Father, of whom are all things, and we in Him; and One Lord, Jesus
Christ, through whom are all things, and we through Him* <span
id="fr_1169"></span>[1170](#fn_1169.md) .

<span id="ii.xiv-p76"></span>11.  And He is called by two names, Jesus
Christ; Jesus, because He saves,—Christ, because He is a Priest <span
id="fr_1170"></span>[1171](#fn_1170.md) .  And knowing this the inspired
Prophet Moses conferred these two titles on two men distinguished above
all <span id="fr_1171"></span>[1172](#fn_1171.md) :  his own successor in
the government, Auses <span id="fr_1172"></span>[1173](#fn_1172.md) , he
renamed Jesus; and his own brother Aaron he surnamed Christ <span
id="fr_1173"></span>[1174](#fn_1173.md) , that by two well-approved men he
might represent at once both the High Priesthood, and the Kingship of
the One Jesus Christ who was to come.  For Christ is a High Priest like
Aaron; since He *glorified not Himself to be made a High Priest, but He
that spake unto Him, Thou art a Priest for ever after the order of
Melchizedek* <span id="fr_1174"></span>[1175](#fn_1174.md) .  And Jesus the
son of Nave was in many things a type of Him.  For when he began to rule
over the people, he began from Jordan <span
id="fr_1175"></span>[1176](#fn_1175.md) , whence Christ also, after He was
baptized, began to preach the gospel.  And the son of Nave appoints
twelve to divide the inheritance <span
id="fr_1176"></span>[1177](#fn_1176.md) ; and twelve Apostles Jesus sends
forth, as heralds of the truth, into all the world.  The typical Jesus
saved Rahab the harlot when she believed:  and the true Jesus says,
*Behold, the publicans and the harlots go before you into the kingdom of
God* <span id="fr_1177"></span>[1178](#fn_1177.md) .  With only a shout the
walls of Jericho fell down in the time of the type:  and because Jesus
said, *There shall not be left here one stone upon another* <span
id="fr_1178"></span>[1179](#fn_1178.md) , the Temple of the Jews opposite
to us is fallen, the cause of its fall not being the denunciation but
the sin of the transgressors.

<span id="ii.xiv-p86"></span>12.  There is One Lord Jesus Christ, a
wondrous name, indirectly announced beforehand by the Prophets.  For
Esaias the Prophet says, *Behold, thy Saviour cometh, having His own
reward* <span id="fr_1179"></span>[1180](#fn_1179.md) .  Now Jesus in
Hebrew is by interpretation *Saviour*.  For the Prophetic gift,
foreseeing the murderous spirit of the Jews against their Lord <span
id="fr_1180"></span>[1181](#fn_1180.md) , veiled His name, lest from
knowing it plainly beforehand they might plot against Him readily.  But
He was openly called Jesus not by men, but by an Angel, who came not by
his own authority, but was sent by the power of God, and said to Joseph,
*Fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife; for that which is con*<span
id="page_61">p. 61</span> <span id="ii.xiv-Page_61"></span>*ceivedin her
is of the Holy Ghost.  And she shall bring forth a Son, and thou shalt
call His name Jesus* <span id="fr_1181"></span>[1182](#fn_1181.md) .  And
immediately he renders the reason of this name, saying, *for He shall
save His people from their sins*.  Consider how He who was not yet born
could have a *people*, unless He was in being before He was born <span
id="fr_1182"></span>[1183](#fn_1182.md) .  This also the Prophet says in
His person, *From the bowels of my mother hath He made mention of My
name* <span id="fr_1183"></span>[1184](#fn_1183.md) ; because the Angel
foretold that He should be called Jesus.  And again concerning Herod’s
plot again he says, *And under the shadow of His hand hath He hid
Me* <span id="fr_1184"></span>[1185](#fn_1184.md) .

<span id="ii.xiv-p93"></span>13.  Jesus then means according to the
Hebrew “Saviour,” but in the Greek tongue “The Healer;” since He is
physician of souls and bodies, curer of spirits, curing the blind in
body <span id="fr_1185"></span>[1186](#fn_1185.md) , and leading minds into
light, healing the visibly lame, and guiding sinners’ steps to
repentance, saying to the palsied, *Sin no more*, and, *Take up thy bed
and walk* <span id="fr_1186"></span>[1187](#fn_1186.md) .  For since the
body was palsied for the sin of the soul, He ministered first to the
soul that He might extend the healing to the body.  If, therefore, any
one is suffering in soul from sins, there is the Physician for him:  and
if any one here is of little faith, let him say to Him, *Help Thou mine
unbelief* <span id="fr_1187"></span>[1188](#fn_1187.md) .  If any is
encompassed also with bodily ailments, let him not be faithless, but let
him draw nigh; for to such diseases also Jesus ministers <span
id="fr_1188"></span>[1189](#fn_1188.md) , and let him learn that Jesus is
the Christ.

<span id="ii.xiv-p98"></span>14.  For that He is Jesus the Jews allow,
but not further that He is Christ.  Therefore saith the Apostle, *Who is
the liar, but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ* <span
id="fr_1189"></span>[1190](#fn_1189.md) ?  But Christ is a High Priest,
*whose priesthood passes not to another* <span
id="fr_1190"></span>[1191](#fn_1190.md) , neither having begun His
Priesthood in time <span id="fr_1191"></span>[1192](#fn_1191.md) , nor
having any successor in His High-Priesthood:  as thou heardest on the
Lord’s day, when we were discoursing in the congregation <span
id="fr_1192"></span>[1193](#fn_1192.md) on the phrase, *After the Order of
Melchizedek*.  He received not the High-Priesthood from bodily
succession, nor was He anointed with oil prepared by man <span
id="fr_1193"></span>[1194](#fn_1193.md) , but before all ages by the
Father; and He so far excels the others as *with an oath* He is made
Priest:  *For they are priests without an oath, but He with an oath by
Him that said, The Lord sware, and will not repent* <span
id="fr_1194"></span>[1195](#fn_1194.md) .  The mere purpose of the Father
was sufficient for surety:  but the mode of assurance is twofold, namely
that with the purpose there follows the oath also, *that by two
immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might
have strong encouragement* <span id="fr_1195"></span>[1196](#fn_1195.md)
for our faith, who receive Christ Jesus as the Son of God.

<span id="ii.xiv-p106"></span>15.  This Christ, when He was come, the
Jews denied, but the devils confessed.  But His forefather David was not
ignorant of Him, when he said, *I have ordained a lamp for mine
Anointed* <span id="fr_1196"></span>[1197](#fn_1196.md) :  which lamp some
have interpreted to be the brightness of Prophecy <span
id="fr_1197"></span>[1198](#fn_1197.md) , others the flesh which He took
upon Him from the Virgin, according to the Apostle’s word, *But we have
this treasure in earthen vessels* <span
id="fr_1198"></span>[1199](#fn_1198.md) .  The Prophet was not ignorant of
Him, when He said, *and announceth unto men His Christ* <span
id="fr_1199"></span>[1200](#fn_1199.md) .  Moses also knew Him, Isaiah knew
Him, and Jeremiah; not one of the Prophets was ignorant of Him.  Even
devils recognised Him, for He rebuked them, and the Scripture says,
*because they knew that He was Christ* <span
id="fr_1200"></span>[1201](#fn_1200.md) .  The Chief-priests knew Him not,
and the devils confessed Him:  the Chief Priests knew Him not, and a
woman of Samaria proclaimed Him, saying, *Come, see a man which told me
all things that ever I did.  Is not this the Christ* <span
id="fr_1201"></span>[1202](#fn_1201.md) ?

<span id="ii.xiv-p113"></span>16.  This is Jesus Christ who came *a
High-Priest of the good things to come* <span
id="fr_1202"></span>[1203](#fn_1202.md) ; who for the bountifulness of His
Godhead imparted His own title to us all.  For kings among men have
their royal style which others may not share:  but Jesus Christ being
the Son of God gave us the dignity of being called Christians.  But some
one will say, The name of “Christians” is new, and was not in use
aforetime <span id="fr_1203"></span>[1204](#fn_1203.md) :  and
new-fashioned phrases are often objected to <span id="page_62">p.
62</span> <span id="ii.xiv-Page_62"></span>on the score of
strangeness <span id="fr_1204"></span>[1205](#fn_1204.md) .  The prophet
made this point safe beforehand, saying, *But upon My servants shall a
new name be called, which shall be blessed upon the earth* <span
id="fr_1205"></span>[1206](#fn_1205.md) .  Let us question the Jews:  Are
ye servants of the Lord, or not?  Shew then your new name.  For ye were
called Jews and Israelites in the time of Moses, and the other prophets,
and after the return from Babylon, and up to the present time:  where
then is your new name?  But we, since we are servants of the Lord, have
that new name:  *new* indeed, but the *new name, which shall be blessed
upon the earth*.  This name caught the world in its grasp:  for Jews are
only in a certain region, but Christians reach to the ends of the
world:  for it is the name of the Only-begotten Son of God that is
proclaimed.

<span id="ii.xiv-p118"></span>17.  But wouldest thou know that the
Apostles knew and preached the name of Christ, or rather had Christ
Himself within them?  Paul says to his hearers, *Or seek ye a proof of
Christ that speaketh in me* <span id="fr_1206"></span>[1207](#fn_1206.md)
?  Paul proclaims Christ, saying, *For we preach not ourselves, but
Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves your servants for Jesus’ sake* <span
id="fr_1207"></span>[1208](#fn_1207.md) .  Who then is this?  The former
persecutor.  O mighty wonder!  The former persecutor himself preaches
Christ.  But wherefore?  Was he bribed?  Nay there was none to use this
mode of persuasion.  But was it that he saw Him present on earth, and
was abashed?  He had already been taken up into heaven.  He went forth
to persecute, and after three days the persecutor is a preacher in
Damascus.  By what power?  Others call friends as witnesses for friends
but I have presented to you as a witness the former enemy:  and dost
thou still doubt?  The testimony of Peter and John, though weighty, was
yet of a kind open to suspicion:  for they were His friends.  But of one
who was formerly his enemy, and afterwards dies for His sake, who can
any longer doubt the truth?

<span id="ii.xiv-p121"></span>18.  At this point of my discourse I am
truly filled with wonder at the wise dispensation of the Holy Spirit;
how He confined the Epistles of the rest to a small number, but to Paul
the former persecutor gave the privilege of writing fourteen.  For it
was not because Peter or John was less that He restrained the gift; God
forbid!  But in order that the doctrine might be beyond question, He
granted to the former enemy and persecutor the privilege of writing
more, in order that we all might thus be made believers.  For *all were
amazed* at Paul, and said, *Is not this he that* was formerly a
persecutor <span id="fr_1208"></span>[1209](#fn_1208.md) ?  Did he not come
hither, that he might lead us away bound to Jerusalem?  Be not amazed,
said Paul, I know that *it is hard for me to kick against the pricks:* 
I know that *I am not worthy to be called an Apostle, because I
persecuted the Church of God* <span id="fr_1209"></span>[1210](#fn_1209.md)
; but I did it *in ignorance* <span id="fr_1210"></span>[1211](#fn_1210.md)
:  for I thought that the preaching of Christ was destruction of the
Law, and knew not that He came Himself to fulfil the Law and not to
destroy it <span id="fr_1211"></span>[1212](#fn_1211.md) .  *But the grace
of God was exceeding abundant in me* <span
id="fr_1212"></span>[1213](#fn_1212.md) .

<span id="ii.xiv-p127"></span>19.  Many, my beloved, are the true
testimonies concerning Christ.  The Father bears witness from heaven of
His Son:  the Holy Ghost bears witness, descending bodily in likeness of
a dove:  the Archangel Gabriel bears witness, bringing good tidings to
Mary:  the Virgin Mother of God <span
id="fr_1213"></span>[1214](#fn_1213.md) bears witness:  the blessed place
of the manger bears witness.  Egypt bears witness, which received the
Lord while yet young in the body <span
id="fr_1214"></span>[1215](#fn_1214.md) :  Symeon bears witness, who
received Him in his arms, and said, *Now, Lord, lettest Thou Thy servant
depart in peace, according to Thy word; for mine eyes have seen Thy
salvation, which Thou hast prepared before the face of all people* <span
id="fr_1215"></span>[1216](#fn_1215.md) .  Anna also, the prophetess, a
most devout widow, of austere life, bears witness of Him.  John the
Baptist bears witness, the greatest among the Prophets, and leader of
the New Covenant, who in a manner united both Covenants in Himself, the
Old and the New.  Jordan is His witness among rivers; the sea of
Tiberias among seas:  blind and lame bear witness, and dead men raised
to life, and devils saying, *What have we to do with Thee, Jesus? we
know Thee, who Thou art, the Holy One of God* <span
id="fr_1216"></span>[1217](#fn_1216.md) .  Winds bear witness, silenced at
His bidding:  five loaves multiplied into five <span id="page_63">p.
63</span> <span id="ii.xiv-Page_63"></span>thousand bear Him witness. 
The holy wood of the Cross bears witness, seen among us to this day, and
from this place now almost filling the whole world, by means of those
who in faith take portions from it <span
id="fr_1217"></span>[1218](#fn_1217.md) .  The palm-tree <span
id="fr_1218"></span>[1219](#fn_1218.md) on the ravine bears witness, having
supplied the palm-branches to the children who then hailed Him. 
Gethsemane <span id="fr_1219"></span>[1220](#fn_1219.md) bears witness,
still to the thoughtful almost shewing Judas.  Golgotha <span
id="fr_1220"></span>[1221](#fn_1220.md) , the holy hill standing above us
here, bears witness to our sight:  the Holy Sepulchre bears witness, and
the stone which lies there <span id="fr_1221"></span>[1222](#fn_1221.md) to
this day.  The sun now shining is His witness, which then at the time of
His saving Passion was eclipsed <span
id="fr_1222"></span>[1223](#fn_1222.md) :  the darkness is His witness,
which was then from the sixth hour to the ninth:  the light bears
witness, which shone forth from the ninth hour until evening.  The Mount
of Olives bears witness, that holy mount from which He ascended to the
Father:  the rain-bearing clouds are His witnesses, having received
their Lord:  yea, and the gates of heaven bear witness \[having received
their Lord <span id="fr_1223"></span>[1224](#fn_1223.md) \], concerning
which the Psalmist said, *Lift up your doors, O ye Princes, and be ye
lift up ye everlasting doors; and the King of Glory shall come in* <span
id="fr_1224"></span>[1225](#fn_1224.md) .  His former enemies bear witness,
of whom the blessed Paul is one, having been a little while His enemy,
but for a long time His servant:  the Twelve Apostles are His witnesses,
having preached the truth not only in words, but also by their own
torments and deaths:  *the shadow of Peter* <span
id="fr_1225"></span>[1226](#fn_1225.md) bears witness, having healed the
sick in the name of Christ.  The handkerchiefs and aprons bear witness,
as in like manner by Christ’s power they wrought cures of old through
Paul <span id="fr_1226"></span>[1227](#fn_1226.md) .  Persians <span
id="fr_1227"></span>[1228](#fn_1227.md) and Goths <span
id="fr_1228"></span>[1229](#fn_1228.md) , and all the Gentile converts bear
witness, by dying for His sake, whom they never saw with eyes of flesh: 
the devils, who to this day <span id="fr_1229"></span>[1230](#fn_1229.md)
are driven out by the faithful, bear witness to Him.

<span id="ii.xiv-p145"></span>20.  So many and diverse, yea and more
than these, are His witnesses:  is then the Christ thus witnessed any
longer disbelieved?  Nay rather if there is any one who formerly
believed not, let him now believe:  and if any was before a believer,
let him receive a greater increase of faith, by believing in our Lord
Jesus Christ, and let him understand whose name he bears.  Thou art
called a Christian:  be tender of the name; let not our Lord Jesus
Christ, the Son of God, be blasphemed through thee:  but rather *let
your good works shine before men* <span
id="fr_1230"></span>[1231](#fn_1230.md) that they who see them may in
Christ Jesus our Lord glorify the Father which is in heaven:   To whom
be the glory, both now and for ever and ever.  Amen.

a super-human Priesthood to which the Son in His Divine nature was
anointed by the Father from eternity is repeated by Cyril in § 14 of
this Lecture, and in Cat. xi. 1, 14.  See Index, “Priesthood,” and the

Comparing what Cyril says here with Cat. iv. 15, and xv. 10, we see that
he means to explain why Christ is called the “Son of Man” when “He
cometh again from heaven,” and “no more from earth.”  The preceding
clause refers to His first coming in the flesh, as differing in the
manner of His conception and birth from other men.

<span id="fn_1134"></span>[58:1135](2070026.htm#fr_1134.md) <span
id="ii.xiv-p28.3"></span>

<span id="ii.xiv-p29"></span> Cf. Athanas. (*c. Arian.* II. xv. 14),
“That very Word who was by nature Lord, and was then made man, hath by
means of a servant’s form been made Lord of all and Christ.”

<span id="fn_1135"></span>[58:1136](2070026.htm#fr_1135.md) <span
id="ii.xiv-p29.3"></span>

<span id="ii.xiv-p30"></span> Cf. Irenæus (III. xvi. 8):  “All therefore
are outside the Dispensation, who under pretence of knowledge understand
that Jesus was one, and Christ another, and the Only-begotten another
(from whom again is the Word), and the Saviour another.”  The
Cerinthians, Ebionites, Ophites, and Valentinians are mentioned by
Irenæus as thus separating the Christ from Jesus.

capacity of each soul.”

id="ii.xiv-p34.1"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.xiv-p34.2"></span>κ προκοπῆς</span>.  We learn from Athanasius
(*c. Arian*. i. 37, 38, 40), that from St. Paul’s language *Philipp*.
ii. 9:  “Wherefore also God highly exalted Him, &c.,” and from [Ps. xlv.
7](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#007.md)<span id="ii.xiv-p34.3"></span>: 
“Thou hast loved righteousness and hated iniquity:  therefore God, thy
God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows,” the
Arians argued that Christ first received Divine honour as Son and Lord
as the reward of His obedience as Man.  Athanasius replies (c. 40):  “He
was not from a lower state promoted; but rather, existing as God, He
took the form of a servant, and in taking it was not promoted but
humbled Himself.  Where then is there here any reward of virtue, or what
advancement (<span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.xiv-p34.4"></span>προκοπή</span>) and promotion in humiliation?”

<span id="ii.xiv-p35"></span>The same doctrine had been previously held
by the disciples of Paul of Samosata, who said that Christ was not
originally God, but after His Incarnation was by advance (<span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.xiv-p35.1"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.xiv-p35.2"></span>κ προκοπῆς</span>) made
God, from being made by nature a mere man:  see Athanas. (*de Decretis*,
§ 24, *c. Arian*. i. 38).  S. Cyril refers to the error and uses the
same word, in xi. 1, 7, 13, 15, 17, and xiv. 27.

<span id="ii.xiv-p38"></span> Origen (*De Principiis*, I. ii. 10) had
argued that “even God cannot be called omnipotent, unless there exist
those over whom He may exercise His power,” and therefore creation must
have been eternal, or God could not have been eternally Omnipotent.  In
other passages Origen declares it an impiety to hold that matter is
co-eternal with God (*De Princip*. II. i. 4), and yet maintains that
there were other worlds before this, and that there was never a time
when there was no world existing.

<span id="ii.xiv-p39"></span>Methodius, in a fragment of his work *On
things Created*, preserved by Photius, and quoted by Bishop Bull (*Def.
Fid. Nic.* II. xiii. 9), argues against these theories of Origen, that
in [John i. 2](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#002.md)<span
id="ii.xiv-p39.1"></span> the words “The same was in the beginning with
God” indicate the authority (<span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.xiv-p39.2"></span>τὸ ἐξουσιαστικόν</span>) of the Word which He
had with the Father before the world came into existence; since from all
eternity God the Father, together with His Word, possessed the Almighty
power whereby whenever He would He could create worlds to rule over.

<span id="ii.xiv-p40"></span>Dean Church remarks that “On the other hand
Tertullian, *contra Hermog*. 3, considering the attributes in question
to belong not to the Divine Nature, but Office, denies that God was
Almighty (Lord?) from eternity; while the Greeks affirmed this (vid.
Cyril Alex. *in Joann*. xvii. 8, p. 963; Athan. *Orat*. ii. 12–14), as
understanding by the term the inherent but latent attribute of doing
what He had not yet done, <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.xiv-p40.1"></span>τὸ ἐξουσιαστικόν</span>.”

<span id="ii.xiv-p41"></span>Cleopas, the Jerusalem Editor, regards the
passage as directed against Paul of Samosata, who asserted that Christ
had become God, and received His kingdom and Lordship only after His
Incarnation, and remarks:—“S. Cyril evidently regards the Lordship of
Jesus Christ as twofold:  one that which from eternity belonged to Him
as God, which he calls natural, according to which ‘He was ever both
Lord and King, as being by nature God’ (Cyril Alex. *in Johann*. cap.
xvii.); and the other the Lordship in time relative to the creatures, by
which He exercises dominion over the works created by Him, as being
their Maker.“

On this text Athanasius wrote a special treatise (*In illud ‘Omnia,’
&c*.), against the arguments of Arius, Eusebius, and their fellows, who
said,—“If all things were delivered (meaning by ‘all’ the Lordship of
Creation), there was once a time when He had them not.  But it He had
them not, He is not of the Father, for if He were, He would on that
account have had them always.”

<span id="ii.xiv-p67"></span>Again (*contr. Arian. Orat*. III. cap.
xxvii. § 36), Athanasius argues:  “Lest a man, perceiving that the Son
has all that the Father hath, from the exact likeness and identity of
what He hath, should wander into the impiety of Sabellius, considering
Him to be the Father, therefore He has said, *Was given unto Me*, and *I
received*, and *Were delivered to Me*, only to shew that He is not the
Father, but the Father’s Word, and the Eternal Son, who, because of His
likeness to the Father, has eternally what He has from Him, and because
He is the Son, has from the Father what eternally He hath.”

<span id="ii.xiv-p102"></span> The word ‘synaxis’ was used by the early
Christians to distinguish their assemblies from the Jewish ‘synagogue,’
a word formed from the same root and more regularly.  ‘Synaxis’ came to
be used more especially of a celebration of the Eucharist.  See Suicer,

id="ii.xiv-p128.2"></span>θεοτόκος</span>— *Deipara*.  Gibbon (Chap.
xlvii. 34) says, “It is not easy to fix the invention of this word,
which La Croze (*Christianisme des Indes*, tom. i. p. 16) ascribes to
Eusebius of Cæsarea and the Arians.  The orthodox testimonies are
produced by Cyril (of Alexandria) and Petavius (*Dogmat. Theolog.* tom.
v. L. v. cap. 15, p. 254, &c.), but the veracity of the Saint is
questionable, and the epithet of <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.xiv-p128.3"></span>θεοτόκος</span> so easily slides from the
margin to the text of a Catholic <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.xiv-p128.4"></span>ms.</span>”  This passage is justly described
as “Gibbon’s calumny” by Dr. Newman:  see his notes on the title <span

c. Arian. Or.* ii. cap. 12, n.; *Or*. iii. capp. 14, 29, 33).  The word
is certainly used by Origen (*Deut*. xxii. 13, Lommatzch. Tom. x. p.
378):  “She that is already betrothed is called a wife, as also in the
case of Joseph and the Theotokos.”  Cf. Archelaus (*Disput. cum Mane*,
cap. xxxiv. “qui de Maria Dei Genetrice natus est”); Eusebius (*de Vita
Constantini*, III. cap. 43:  “The pious Empress adorned with rare
memorials the place of the travail of the Theotokos”).  For other

state of the Church in Egypt in those times, says:  ‘Egypt welcomes and

Him proclaimed by the Apostles, it may in their day also be honoured as
having been first to welcome Him’” (Cleopas).

Gospels see Meyer, *Commentary*, [Matt. xxvii.
45](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#045.md)<span id="ii.xiv-p137.1"></span>. 
An eclipse of the sun was of course impossible, as the moon was full. 
Mr. J. R. Hind (*Historical Eclipses*, “Times,” 19th July, 1872) states
that the solar eclipse, mentioned by Phlegon the freedman of Hadrian,
which occurred on Nov. 24, <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.xiv-p137.2"></span>a.d.</span> 29, and was partial at Jerusalem,
is “the only solar eclipse that could have been visible at Jerusalem
during the period usually fixed for the ministry of Christ.”  He adds,
“The Moon was eclipsed on the generally received date of the
Crucifixion, 3 April, <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.xiv-p137.3"></span>a.d.</span> 33.  I find she had emerged from
the earth’s dark shadow a quarter of an hour before she rose at
Jerusalem (6:36 p.m.), but the penumbra continued upon her disc for an
hour afterwards.”  Thus the “darkness from the sixth hour unto the
ninth” cannot be explained as the natural effect of an eclipse either
solar or lunar.

Christianity.  After suffering severe persecution, he was allowed by the
Constantius to take refuge with his Arian converts in Mœsia and Thrace. 
This migration took place in 348 <span class="sc"><span
