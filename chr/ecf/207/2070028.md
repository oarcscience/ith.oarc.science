id="ii.xvi-p2.1"></span>On the words Incarnate, and Made Man.</span>

<span id="ii.xvi-p3"></span><span id="ii.xvi-p3.1"></span><span
class="sc"><span id="ii.xvi-p3.2"></span>[Isaiah vii.
10-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#010.md)<span
id="ii.xvi-p3.3"></span></span>

<span id="ii.xvi-p4"></span>*“And the Lord spoke again unto Ahaz,
saying, Ask thee a sign, &c.:*”  and “*Behold! a virgin shall conceive,
and bear a son, and shall call His name Emmanuel,* &c.”

<span id="ii.xvi-p5"></span>1.  <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.xvi-p5.1"></span>Nurslings</span> of purity and disciples of
chastity, raise we our hymn to the Virgin-born God <span
id="fr_1339"></span>[1340](#fn_1339.md) with lips full of purity. 
Deemed <span id="fr_1340"></span>[1341](#fn_1340.md) worthy to partake of
the flesh of the Spiritual Lamb <span
id="fr_1341"></span>[1342](#fn_1341.md) , let us take the head together
with the feet <span id="fr_1342"></span>[1343](#fn_1342.md) , the Deity
being understood as the head, and the Manhood taken as the feet. 
Hearers of the Holy Gospels, let us listen to John the Divine <span
id="fr_1343"></span>[1344](#fn_1343.md) .  For he who said, *In the
beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was
God* <span id="fr_1344"></span>[1345](#fn_1344.md) , went on to say, *and
the Word was made flesh* <span id="fr_1345"></span>[1346](#fn_1345.md) . 
For neither is it holy to worship the mere man, nor religious to say
that He is God only without the Manhood.  For if Christ is God, as
indeed He is, but took not human nature upon Him, we are strangers to
salvation.  Let us then worship Him as God, but believe that He also was
made Man.  For neither is there any profit in calling Him man without
Godhead nor any salvation in refusing to confess the Manhood together
with the Godhead.  Let us confess the presence of Him who is both King
and Physician.  For Jesus the King when about to become our Physician,
*girded Himself with the linen* of humanity <span
id="fr_1346"></span>[1347](#fn_1346.md) , and healed that which was sick. 
The perfect Teacher of babes <span id="fr_1347"></span>[1348](#fn_1347.md)
became a babe among babes, that He might give wisdom to the foolish. 
The Bread of heaven came down on earth <span
id="fr_1348"></span>[1349](#fn_1348.md) that He might feed the hungry.

<span id="ii.xvi-p16"></span>2.  But the sons of the Jews by setting at
nought Him that came, and looking for him who cometh in wickedness,
rejected the true Messiah, and wait for the deceiver, themselves
deceived; herein also the Saviour being found true, who said, *I am come
in My Father’s name, and ye receive Me not:  but if another shall come
in his own name, him ye will receive* <span
id="fr_1349"></span>[1350](#fn_1349.md) .  It is well also to put a
question to the Jews.  Is the Prophet Esaias, who saith that Emmanuel
shall be born of a virgin, true or false <span
id="fr_1350"></span>[1351](#fn_1350.md) ?  For if they charge him with
falsehood, no wonder:  for their custom is not only to charge with
falsehood, but also to stone the Prophets.  But if the Prophet is true,
point to the Emmanuel, and say, Whether is He who is to come, for whom
ye are looking, to be born of a virgin or not?  For if He is not to be
born of a virgin, ye accuse the Prophet of falsehood:  but if in Him
that is to come ye expect this, why do ye reject that which has come to
pass already?

<span id="ii.xvi-p19"></span>3.  Let the Jews, then, be led astray,
since they so will:  but let the Church of God be glorified.  For we
receive God the Word made Man in truth, not, as heretics say <span
id="fr_1351"></span>[1352](#fn_1351.md) , of the will of man and woman, but
of <span class="sc"><span id="ii.xvi-p20.1"></span>The Virgin and the
Holy Ghost <span id="fr_1352"></span>[1353](#fn_1352.md) </span> according
to the <span id="page_73">p. 73</span> <span
id="ii.xvi-Page_73"></span>Gospel, <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.xvi-p21.5"></span>Made Man <span
id="fr_1353"></span>[1354](#fn_1353.md) </span>, not in seeming but in
truth.  And that He was truly Man made of the Virgin, wait for the
proper time of instruction in this Lecture, and thou shalt receive the
proofs <span id="fr_1354"></span>[1355](#fn_1354.md) :  for the error of
the heretics is manifold.  And some have said that He has not been born
at all of a virgin <span id="fr_1355"></span>[1356](#fn_1355.md) :  others
that He has been born, not of a virgin, but of a wife dwelling with a
husband.  Others say that the Christ is not God made Man, but a man made
God <span id="fr_1356"></span>[1357](#fn_1356.md) .  For they dared to say
that not He—the pre-existent Word—was made Man; but a certain man was by
advancement crowned.

<span id="ii.xvi-p26"></span>4.  But remember thou what was said
yesterday concerning His Godhead.  Believe that He the Only-begotten Son
of God—He Himself was again begotten of a Virgin.  Believe the
Evangelist John when he says, *And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt
among us* <span id="fr_1357"></span>[1358](#fn_1357.md) .  For the Word is
eternal, <span class="sc"><span id="ii.xvi-p27.2"></span>Begotten of the
Father Before All Worlds</span>:  but the flesh He took on Him recently
for our sake.  Many contradict this, and say:  “What cause was there so
great, for God to come down into humanity?  And, is it at all God’s
nature to hold intercourse with men?  And, is it possible for a virgin
to bear, without man?”  Since then there is much controversy, and the
battle has many forms, come, let us by the grace of Christ, and the
prayers of those who are present, resolve each question.

<span id="ii.xvi-p28"></span>5.  And first let us inquire for what cause
Jesus came down.  Now mind not my argumentations, for perhaps thou
mayest be misled but unless thou receive testimony of the Prophets on
each matter, believe not what I say:  unless thou learn from the Holy
Scriptures concerning the Virgin, and the place, the time, and the
manner, *receive not testimony from man* <span
id="fr_1358"></span>[1359](#fn_1358.md) .  For one who at present thus
teaches may possibly be suspected:  but what man of sense will suspect
one that prophesied a thousand and more years beforehand?  If then thou
seekest the cause of Christ’s coming, go back to the first book of the
Scriptures.  In six days God made the world:  but the world was for
man.  The sun however resplendent with bright beams, yet was made to
give light to man, yea, and all living creatures were formed to serve
us:  herbs and trees were created for our enjoyment.  All the works of
creation were good, but none of these was an image of God, save man
only.  The sun was formed by a mere command, but man by God’s hands: 
*Let us make man after our image, and after our likeness* <span
id="fr_1359"></span>[1360](#fn_1359.md) .  A wooden image of an earthly
king is held in honour; how much more a rational image of God?

<span id="ii.xvi-p31"></span>But when this the greatest of the works of
creation was disporting himself in Paradise, the envy of the Devil cast
him out.  The enemy was rejoicing over the fall of him whom he had
envied:  wouldest thou have had the enemy continue to rejoice?  Not
daring to accost the man because of his strength, he accosted as being
weaker the woman, still a virgin:  for it was after the expulsion from
Paradise that *Adam knew his wife* <span
id="fr_1360"></span>[1361](#fn_1360.md) .

<span id="ii.xvi-p33"></span>6.  Cain and Abel succeeded in the second
generation of mankind:  and Cain was the first murderer.  Afterwards a
deluge was poured abroad because of the great wickedness of men:  fire
came down from heaven upon the people of Sodom because of their
transgression.  After a time God chose out Israel:  but Israel also
turned aside, and the chosen race was wounded.  For while Moses stood
before God in the mount, the people were worshipping a calf instead of
God.  In the lifetime of Moses, the law-giver who had said, *Thou shalt
not commit adultery*, a man dared to enter a place of harlotry and
transgress <span id="fr_1361"></span>[1362](#fn_1361.md) .  After Moses,
Prophets were sent to cure Israel:  but in their healing office they
lamented that they were not able to overcome the disease, so that one of
them says, *Woe is me! for the godly man is perished out of the earth,
and there is none that doeth right among men* <span
id="fr_1362"></span>[1363](#fn_1362.md) :  and again, *They are all gone
out of the way, they are together became unprofitable; there is none
that doeth good, no, not one* <span id="fr_1363"></span>[1364](#fn_1363.md)
:  and again, *Cursing and stealing, and adultery, and murder are poured
out upon the land* <span id="fr_1364"></span>[1365](#fn_1364.md) .  *Their
sons and their daughters* <span id="page_74">p. 74</span> <span
id="ii.xvi-Page_74"></span>*they sacrificed unto devils* <span
id="fr_1365"></span>[1366](#fn_1365.md) .  *They used auguries, and
enchantments, and divinations* <span
id="fr_1366"></span>[1367](#fn_1366.md) .  *And again, they fastened their
garments with cords, and made hangings attached to the altar* <span
id="fr_1367"></span>[1368](#fn_1367.md) .

<span id="ii.xvi-p41"></span>7.  Very great was the wound of man’s
nature; *from the feet to the head there was no soundness in it;* none
could apply *mollifying ointment, neither oil, nor bandages* <span
id="fr_1368"></span>[1369](#fn_1368.md) .  Then bewailing and wearying
themselves, the Prophets said, *Who shall give salvation out of
Sion* <span id="fr_1369"></span>[1370](#fn_1369.md) ?  And again, *Let Thy
hand be upon the man of Thy right hand, and upon the son of man whom
Thou madest strong for Thyself:  so will not we go back from Thee* <span
id="fr_1370"></span>[1371](#fn_1370.md) .  And another of the Prophets
entreated, saying, *Bow the heavens, O Lord and come down* <span
id="fr_1371"></span>[1372](#fn_1371.md) .  The wounds of man’s nature pass
our healing.  *They slew Thy Prophets, and cast down Thine altars* <span
id="fr_1372"></span>[1373](#fn_1372.md) .  The evil is irretrievable by us,
and needs thee to retrieve it.

<span id="ii.xvi-p47"></span>8.  The Lord heard the prayer of the
Prophets.  The Father disregarded not the perishing of our race; He sent
forth His Son, the Lord from heaven, as healer:  and one of the Prophets
saith, *The Lord whom ye seek, cometh, and shall suddenly come* <span
id="fr_1373"></span>[1374](#fn_1373.md) .  Whither?  *The Lord* shall come
*to His own temple*, where ye stoned Him.  Then another of the Prophets,
on hearing this, saith to him:  In speaking of the salvation of God,
speakest thou quietly?  In preaching the good tidings of God’s coming
for salvation, speakest thou in secret?  *O thou that bringest good
tidings to Zion, get thee up into the high mountain.  Speak to the
cities of Judah*.  What am I to speak?  *Behold our God!  Behold! the
Lord cometh with strength* <span id="fr_1374"></span>[1375](#fn_1374.md) ! 
Again the Lord Himself saith, *Behold! I come, and I will dwell in the
midst of thee, saith the Lord.  And many nations shall flee unto the
Lord* <span id="fr_1375"></span>[1376](#fn_1375.md) .  The Israelites
rejected salvation through Me:  *I come to gather all nations and
tongues* <span id="fr_1376"></span>[1377](#fn_1376.md) .  For *He came to
His own and His own received Him not* <span
id="fr_1377"></span>[1378](#fn_1377.md) .  Thou comest and what dost Thou
bestow on the nations?  *I come to gather all nations, and I will leave
on them a sign* <span id="fr_1378"></span>[1379](#fn_1378.md) .  For from
My conflict upon the Cross I give to each of My soldiers a royal seal to
bear upon his forehead.  Another also of the Prophets said, *He bowed
the heavens also, and came down; and darkness was under His feet* <span
id="fr_1379"></span>[1380](#fn_1379.md) .  For His coming down from heaven
was not known by men.

<span id="ii.xvi-p55"></span>9.  Afterwards Solomon hearing his father
David speak these things, built a wondrous house, and foreseeing Him who
was to come into it, said in astonishment, *Will God in very deed dwell
with men on the earth* <span id="fr_1380"></span>[1381](#fn_1380.md) ? 
Yea, saith David by anticipation in the Psalm inscribed *For Solomon*,
wherein is this, *He shall come down like rain into a fleece* <span
id="fr_1381"></span>[1382](#fn_1381.md) :  *rain*, because of His heavenly
nature, and into a fleece, because of His humanity.  For rain, coming
down into a fleece, comes down noiselessly:  so that the Magi, not
knowing the mystery of the Nativity, say, *Where is He that is born King
of the Jews* <span id="fr_1382"></span>[1383](#fn_1382.md) ? and Herod
being troubled inquired concerning Him who was born, and said, *Where is
the Christ to be born* <span id="fr_1383"></span>[1384](#fn_1383.md) ?

<span id="ii.xvi-p60"></span>10.  But who is this that cometh down?  He
says in what follows, *And with the sun He endureth, and before the moon
generations of generations* <span id="fr_1384"></span>[1385](#fn_1384.md)
.  And again another of the Prophets saith, *Rejoice greatly, O daughter
of Sion, shout, O daughter of Jerusalem.  Behold! thy King cometh unto
thee, just and having salvation* <span
id="fr_1385"></span>[1386](#fn_1385.md) .  Kings are many; of which
speakest thou, O Prophet?  Give us a sign which other Kings have not. 
If thou say, A king clad in purple, the dignity of the apparel has been
anticipated.  If thou say, Guarded by spear-men, and sitting in a golden
chariot, this also has been anticipated by others.  Give us a sign
peculiar to the King whose coming thou announcest.  And the Prophet
maketh answer and saith, *Behold! thy King cometh unto thee, just, and
having salvation:  He is meek, and riding upon an ass and a young foal*,
not on a chariot.  Thou hast a unique sign of the King who came.  Jesus
alone of kings sat upon an unyoked <span
id="fr_1386"></span>[1387](#fn_1386.md) foal, entering into Jerusalem with
acclamations as a king.  And when this King is come, what doth He? 
*Thou also by the blood of the covenant hast sent forth thy prisoners
out of the pit wherein is no water* <span
id="fr_1387"></span>[1388](#fn_1387.md) .

<span id="ii.xvi-p65"></span>11.  But He might perchance even sit upon a
foal:  give us rather a sign, where the King that entereth shall stand. 
And give the sign not far from the city, that it may not be unknown to
us:  and give us the sign plain before our eyes, that even when in the
city we may behold the place.  And the Prophet again makes answer,
saying:  *And His feet shall stand in that day upon the Mount of Olives
which is before Jerusalem on the east* <span
id="fr_1388"></span>[1389](#fn_1388.md) .  Does <span id="page_75">p.
75</span> <span id="ii.xvi-Page_75"></span>any one standing within the
city fail to behold the place?

<span id="ii.xvi-p67"></span>12.  We have two signs, and we desire to
learn a third.  Tell us what the Lord doth when He is come.  Another
Prophet saith, *Behold! our God*, and afterwards, *He will come and save
us.  Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the
deaf shall hear:  then shall the lame man leap as an hart, and the
tongue of the stammerers shall be distinct* <span
id="fr_1389"></span>[1390](#fn_1389.md) .  But let yet another testimony be
told us.  Thou sayest, O Prophet, that the Lord cometh, and doeth signs
such as never were:  what other clear sign tellest thou?  *The Lord
Himself entereth into judgment with the elders of His people, and with
the princes thereof* <span id="fr_1390"></span>[1391](#fn_1390.md) .  A
notable sign!  The Master judged by His servants, the elders, and
submitting to it.

<span id="ii.xvi-p70"></span>13.  These things the Jews read, but hear
not:  for they have stopped the ears of their heart, that they may not
hear.  But let us believe in Jesus Christ, as having come in the flesh
and *been made Man*, because we could not receive Him otherwise.  For
since we could not look upon or enjoy Him as He was, He became what we
are, that so we might be permitted to enjoy Him.  For if we cannot look
full on the sun, which was made on the fourth day, could we behold God
its Creator <span id="fr_1391"></span>[1392](#fn_1391.md) ?  The Lord came
down in fire on Mount Sinai, and the people could not bear it, but said
to Moses, *Speak thou with us, and we will hear; and let not God speak
to us, lest we die* <span id="fr_1392"></span>[1393](#fn_1392.md) :  and
again, *For who is there of all flesh that hath heard the voice of the
living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, and shall live* <span
id="fr_1393"></span>[1394](#fn_1393.md) ?  If to hear the voice of God
speaking is a cause of death, how shall not the sight of God Himself
bring death?  And what wonder?  Even Moses himself saith, *I exceedingly
fear and quake* <span id="fr_1394"></span>[1395](#fn_1394.md) .

<span id="ii.xvi-p75"></span>14.  What wouldest thou then?  That He who
came for our salvation should become a minister of destruction because
men could not bear Him? or that He should suit His grace to our
measure?  Daniel could not bear the vision of an Angel, and wert thou
capable of the sight of the Lord of Angels?  Gabriel appeared, and
Daniel fell down:  and of what nature or in what guise was he that
appeared?  His countenance was like lightning <span
id="fr_1395"></span>[1396](#fn_1395.md) ; not like the sun: *and his eyes
as lamps of fire*, not as a furnace of fire:  *and the voice of his
words as the voice of a multitude*, not as the voice of twelve legions
of angels; nevertheless the Prophet fell down.  And the Angel cometh
unto him, saying, *Fear not, Daniel, stand upright:  be of good courage,
thy words are heard* <span id="fr_1396"></span>[1397](#fn_1396.md) .  And
Daniel says, I stood up trembling <span
id="fr_1397"></span>[1398](#fn_1397.md) :  and not even so did he make
answer, until the likeness of a man’s hand touched him.  And when he
that appeared was changed into the appearance of a man, then Daniel
spoke:  and what saith he?  *O my Lord, at the vision of Thee my inward
parts were turned within me, and no strength remaineth in me, neither is
there breath left in me* <span id="fr_1398"></span>[1399](#fn_1398.md) . 
If an Angel appearing took away the Prophet’s voice and strength, would
the appearance of God have allowed him to breathe?  And until *there
touched me as it were a vision of a man* <span
id="fr_1399"></span>[1400](#fn_1399.md) , saith the Scripture, Daniel took
not courage.  So then after trial shewn of our weakness, the Lord
assumed that which man required:  for since man required to hear from
one of like countenance, the Saviour took on Him the nature of like
affections, that men might be the more easily instructed.

<span id="ii.xvi-p81"></span>15.  Learn also another cause.  Christ came
that He might be baptized, and might sanctify Baptism:  He came that He
might work wonders, walking upon the waters of the sea.  Since then
before His appearance in flesh, *the sea saw Him and fled, and Jordan
was turned back* <span id="fr_1400"></span>[1401](#fn_1400.md) , the Lord
took to Himself His body, that the sea might endure the sight, and
Jordan receive Him without fear.  This then is one cause; but there is
also a second.  Through Eve yet virgin came death; through a virgin, or
rather from a virgin, must the Life appear:  that as the serpent
beguiled the one, so to the other Gabriel might bring good tidings <span
id="fr_1401"></span>[1402](#fn_1401.md) .  Men forsook God, and made carved
images of men.  Since therefore an image of man was falsely worshipped
as God, God became truly Man, that the falsehood might be done away. 
The Devil had used the flesh as an instrument against us; and Paul
knowing this, saith, *But I see another law in my members warring
against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity* <span
id="fr_1402"></span>[1403](#fn_1402.md) , and the rest.  By the very same
weapons, therefore, wherewith the Devil used to vanquish us, have we
been saved.  The Lord took on Him from us our likeness, that He might
save man’s nature:  He took our likeness, that He might give greater
grace to that which lacked; that sinful humanity might become partaker
of God.  *For where sin abounded, grace did much more abound* <span
id="fr_1403"></span>[1404](#fn_1403.md) .  It <span id="page_76">p.
76</span> <span id="ii.xvi-Page_76"></span>behoved the Lord to suffer
for us; but if the Devil had known Him, he would not have dared to
approach Him.  *For had they known it, they would not have crucified the
Lord of Glory* <span id="fr_1404"></span>[1405](#fn_1404.md) .  His body
therefore was made a bait to death that the dragon <span
id="fr_1405"></span>[1406](#fn_1405.md) , hoping to devour it, might
disgorge those also who had been already devoured <span
id="fr_1406"></span>[1407](#fn_1406.md) .  For *Death prevailed and
devoured*; and again, *God wiped away every tear from off every
face* <span id="fr_1407"></span>[1408](#fn_1407.md) .

<span id="ii.xvi-p90"></span>16.  Was it without reason that Christ was
made Man?  Are our teachings ingenious phrases and human subtleties? 
Are not the Holy Scriptures our salvation?  Are not the predictions of
the Prophets?  Keep then, I pray thee, this deposit <span
id="fr_1408"></span>[1409](#fn_1408.md) undisturbed, and let none remove
thee:  believe that God became Man.  But though it has been proved
possible for Him to be made Man, yet if the Jews still disbelieve, let
us hold this forth to them:  What strange thing do we announce in saying
that God was made Man, when yourselves say that Abraham received the
Lord as a guest <span id="fr_1409"></span>[1410](#fn_1409.md) ?  What
strange thing do we announce, when Jacob says, *For I have seen God face
to face, and my life is preserved* <span
id="fr_1410"></span>[1411](#fn_1410.md) ?  The Lord, who ate with Abraham,
ate also with us.  What strange thing then do we announce?  Nay more, we
produce two witnesses, those who stood before Lord on Mount Sinai: 
Moses was in a *clift of the rock* <span
id="fr_1411"></span>[1412](#fn_1411.md) , and Elias was once in a clift of
the rock <span id="fr_1412"></span>[1413](#fn_1412.md) :  they being
present with Him at His Transfiguration on Mount Tabor, *spoke* to the
Disciples *of His decease which fire should accomplish at
Jerusalem* <span id="fr_1413"></span>[1414](#fn_1413.md) .  But, as I said
before, it has been proved possible for Him to be made man:  and the
rest of the proofs may be left for the studious to collect.

<span id="ii.xvi-p97"></span>17.  My statement, however, promised to
declare <span id="fr_1414"></span>[1415](#fn_1414.md) also the time of the
Saviour’s and the place:  and I must not go away convicted of falsehood,
but rather send away the Church’s novices <span
id="fr_1415"></span>[1416](#fn_1415.md) well assured.  Let us therefore
inquire the time when our Lord came:  because His coming is recent, and
is disputed:  and because *Christ Jesus is the same yesterday, and
to-day, and for ever* <span id="fr_1416"></span>[1417](#fn_1416.md) . 
Moses then, the prophet, saith, *A Prophet shall the Lord your God raise
up unto you of your brethren, like unto me* <span
id="fr_1417"></span>[1418](#fn_1417.md) :  but let that “*like unto me*” be
reserved awhile to be examined in its proper place <span
id="fr_1418"></span>[1419](#fn_1418.md) .  But when cometh this Prophet
that is expected?  Recur, he says, to what has been written by me: 
examine carefully Jacob’s prophecy addressed to Judah:  *Judah, thee may
thy brethren praise*, and afterwards, not to quote the whole, *A prince
shall not fail out of Judah, nor a ruler from his loins, until He come,
for whom it is reserved; and He is the expectation, not of the Jews but
of the Gentiles* <span id="fr_1419"></span>[1420](#fn_1419.md) .  He gave,
therefore, as a sign of Christ’s advent the cessation of the Jewish
rule.  If they are not now under the Romans, the Christ is not yet
come:  if they still have a prince of the race of Judah and of
David <span id="fr_1420"></span>[1421](#fn_1420.md) , he is not yet come
that was expected.  For I am ashamed to tell of their recent doings
concerning those who are now called Patriarchs <span
id="fr_1421"></span>[1422](#fn_1421.md) among them, and what their descent
is, and who their mother:  but I leave it to those who know.  But He
that cometh as *the expectation of the Gentiles*, what further sign then
hath He?  He says next, *Binding his foal unto the vine* <span
id="fr_1422"></span>[1423](#fn_1422.md) .  Thou seest that foal which was
clearly announced by Zachariah <span
id="fr_1423"></span>[1424](#fn_1423.md) .

<span id="ii.xvi-p108"></span>18.  But again thou askest yet another
testimony of the time.  *The <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.xvi-p108.1"></span>Lord</span> said unto Me, Thou art My Son;
this day have I begotten Thee*:  and a few words further on, *Thou shalt
rule them with a rod of iron* <span id="fr_1424"></span>[1425](#fn_1424.md)
.  I have said before that the kingdom of the Romans is clearly called a
rod of iron; but what is wanting concerning this let us further call to
mind out of Daniel.  For in relating and interpreting to Nebuchadnezzar
the image of the statue, he tells also his whole vision concerning it: 
and that a stone cut out of a mountain without hands, that is, not set
up by human contrivance, should overpower the whole world:  and he
speaks most clearly thus; *And in the days of* <span id="page_77">p.
77</span> <span id="ii.xvi-Page_77"></span>*those kingdoms the God of
heaven shall set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed, and His
kingdom shall not be left to another people* <span
id="fr_1425"></span>[1426](#fn_1425.md) .

<span id="ii.xvi-p111"></span>19.  But we seek still more clearly the
proof of the time of His coming.  For man being hard to persuade, unless
he gets the very years for a clear calculation, does not believe what is
stated.  What then is the season, and what the manner of the time?  It
is when, on the failure of the kings descended from Judah, Herod a
foreigner succeeds to the kingdom?  The Angel, therefore, who converses
with Daniel says, and do thou now mark the words, *And thou shalt know
and understand:  From the going forth of the word for making
answer* <span id="fr_1426"></span>[1427](#fn_1426.md) , *and for the
building of Jerusalem, until Messiah the Prince are seven weeks and
three score and two weeks* <span id="fr_1427"></span>[1428](#fn_1427.md) . 
Now three score and nine weeks of years contain four hundred and
eighty-three years.  He said, therefore, that after the building of
Jerusalem, four hundred and eighty-three years having passed, and the
rulers having failed, then cometh a certain king of another race, in
whose time the Christ is to be born.  Now Darius the Mede <span
id="fr_1428"></span>[1429](#fn_1428.md) built the city in the sixth year of
his own reign, and first year of the 66th Olympiad according to the
Greeks.  Olympiad is the name among the Greeks of the games celebrated
after four years, because of the day which in every four years of the
sun’s courses is made up of the three <span
id="fr_1429"></span>[1430](#fn_1429) (supernumerary.md) hours in each
year.  And Herod is king in the 186th Olympiad, in the 4th year
thereof.  Now from the 66th to the 186th Olympiad there are 120
Olympiads intervening, and a little over.  So then the 120 Olympiads
make up 480 years:  for the other three years remaining are perhaps
taken up in the interval between the first and fourth years.  And there
thou hast the proof according to the Scripture which saith, *From the
going forth of the word that Jerusalem be restored and built until
Messiah the Prince are seven weeks and sixty-two weeks*.  Of the times,
therefore, thou hast for the present this proof, although there are also
other different interpretations concerning the aforesaid weeks of years
in Daniel.

<span id="ii.xvi-p116"></span>20.  But now hear the place of the
promise, as Micah says, *And thou, Bethlehem, house of Ephrathah, art
thou little to be among the thousands of Judah?  For out of thee shall
come forth unto Me a ruler, to be governor in Israel:  and His goings
forth are front the beginning, from the days of eternity* <span
id="fr_1430"></span>[1431](#fn_1430.md) .  But assuredly as to the places,
thou being an inhabitant of Jerusalem, knowest also beforehand what is
written in the hundred and thirty-first psalm.  *Lo! we heard of it at
Ephrathah, we found it in the plains of the wood <span
id="fr_1431"></span>[1432](#fn_1431.md)* .  For a few years ago the place
was woody <span id="fr_1432"></span>[1433](#fn_1432.md) .  Again thou hast
heard Habakkuk say to the Lord, *When the years draw nigh, thou shalt be
made known, when the time is come, thou shalt be shewn* <span
id="fr_1433"></span>[1434](#fn_1433.md) .  And what is the sign, O Prophet,
of the Lord’s coming?  And presently he saith, *In the midst of two
lives shalt thou be known* <span id="fr_1434"></span>[1435](#fn_1434.md) ,
plainly saying this to the Lord, “Having come in the flesh thou livest
and diest, and after rising from the dead thou livest again.”  Further,
from what part of the region round Jerusalem cometh He?  From east, or
west, or north, or south?  Tell us exactly.  And he makes answer most
plainly and says, *God shall come from Teman* <span
id="fr_1435"></span>[1436](#fn_1435.md) (now Teman is by interpretation
‘south’) *and the Holy One from Mount Paran* <span
id="fr_1436"></span>[1437](#fn_1436.md) , *shady, woody*:  what the
Psalmist <span id="page_78">p. 78</span> <span
id="ii.xvi-Page_78"></span>spake in like words, *We found it in the
plains of the wood*.

<span id="ii.xvi-p124"></span>21.  We ask further, of whom cometh He and
how?  And this Esaias tells us:  *Behold! the virgin shall conceive in
her womb, and shall bring forth a Son, and they shall call His name
Emmanuel* <span id="fr_1437"></span>[1438](#fn_1437.md) .  This the Jews
contradict, for of old it is their wont wickedly to oppose the truth: 
and they say that it is not written “the virgin,” but “the damsel.”  But
though I assent to what they say, even so I find the truth.  For we must
ask them, If a virgin be forced, when does she cry out and call for
helpers, after or before the outrage?  If, therefore, the Scripture
elsewhere says, *The betrothed damsel cried, and there was none to save
her* <span id="fr_1438"></span>[1439](#fn_1438.md) , doth it not speak of a
virgin?

<span id="ii.xvi-p127"></span>But that you may learn more plainly that
even a virgin is called in Holy Scripture a “damsel,” hear the Book of
the Kings, speaking of Abishag the Shunamite, *And the damsel was very
fair* <span id="fr_1439"></span>[1440](#fn_1439.md) :  for that as a virgin
she was chosen and brought to David is admitted.

<span id="ii.xvi-p129"></span>22.  But the Jews say again, This was said
to Ahaz in reference to Hezekiah.  Well, then, let us read the
Scripture:  *Ask thee a sign of the Lord thy God, in the depth or in the
height* <span id="fr_1440"></span>[1441](#fn_1440.md) .  And the sign
certainly must be something astonishing.  For the water from the rock
was a sign, the sea divided, the sun turning back, and the like.  But in
what I am going to mention there is still more manifest refutation of
the Jews.  (I know that I am speaking at much length, and that my
hearers are wearied:  but bear with the fulness of my statements,
because it is for Christ’s sake these questions are moved, and they
concern no ordinary matters.)  Now as Isaiah spoke this in the reign of
Ahaz, and Ahaz reigned only sixteen years, and the prophecy was spoken
to him within these years, the objection of the Jews is refuted by the
fact that the succeeding king, Hezekiah, son of Ahaz, was twenty-five
years old when he began to reign:  for as the prophecy is confined
within sixteen years, he must have been begotten of Ahaz full nine years
before the prophecy.  What need then was there to utter the prophecy
concerning one who had been already begotten even before the reign of
father Ahaz <span id="fr_1441"></span>[1442](#fn_1441.md) ?  For he said
not, *hath conceived*, but “*the virgin shall conceive*,” speaking as
with foreknowledge <span id="fr_1442"></span>[1443](#fn_1442.md) .

<span id="ii.xvi-p133"></span>23.  We know then for certain that the
Lord was to be born of a Virgin, but we have to shew of what family the
Virgin was.  *The Lord sware in truth unto David, and will not set it
aside.  Of the fruit of body will I set upon thy throne* <span
id="fr_1443"></span>[1444](#fn_1443.md) : * and again, seed will I
establish for ever, and his throne as the days of heaven* <span
id="fr_1444"></span>[1445](#fn_1444.md) . * And afterwards, Once have I
sworn by My holiness that I will not lie unto David.  His seed shall
endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before Me, and as the moon
established for ever* <span id="fr_1445"></span>[1446](#fn_1445.md) .  Thou
seest that the discourse is of Christ, not of Solomon.  For Solomon’s
throne endured not as the sun.  But if any deny this, because Christ sat
not on David’s throne of wood, we will bring forward that saying, *The
Scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses’ seat* <span
id="fr_1446"></span>[1447](#fn_1446.md) :  for it signifies not his wooden
seat, but the authority of his teaching.  In like manner then I would
have you seek for David’s throne not the throne of wood, but the kingdom
itself.  Take, too, as my witnesses the children who cried
aloud,*Hosanna to the Son of David* <span
id="fr_1447"></span>[1448](#fn_1447.md) , *blessed is the King of
Israel* <span id="fr_1448"></span>[1449](#fn_1448.md) .  And the blind men
also say, *Son of David, have mercy on us* <span
id="fr_1449"></span>[1450](#fn_1449.md) .  Gabriel too testifies plainly to
Mary, saying, *And the Lord God shall give unto Him the throne of His
father David* <span id="fr_1450"></span>[1451](#fn_1450.md) .  Paul also
saith, *Remember Jesus Christ raised from the dead, of the seed of
David, according to my Gospel* <span
id="fr_1451"></span>[1452](#fn_1451.md) :  and in the beginning of the
Epistle to the Romans he saith, *Which was made of the seed of David
according to the flesh* <span id="fr_1452"></span>[1453](#fn_1452.md) . 
Receive thou therefore Him that was born of David, believing the
prophecy which saith, *And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse,
and He that shall rise to rule over the Gentiles:  in Him shall the
Gentiles trust* <span id="fr_1453"></span>[1454](#fn_1453.md) .

<span id="ii.xvi-p145"></span>24.  But the Jews are much troubled at
these things.  This also Isaiah foreknew, saying, *And they shall wish
that they had been burnt with fire:  for unto us a child is born* (not
unto them), *unto us a Son is given* <span
id="fr_1454"></span>[1455](#fn_1454.md) .  Mark thou <span id="page_79">p.
79</span> <span id="ii.xvi-Page_79"></span>that at first He was the Son
of God, then was given to us.  And a little after he says, *And of His
peace there is no bound* <span id="fr_1455"></span>[1456](#fn_1455.md) . 
The Romans have bounds:  of the kingdom of the Son of God there is no
bound.  The Persians and the Medes have bounds, but the Son has no
bound.  Then next, *upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom to
order it*.  The Holy Virgin, therefore, is from David.

<span id="ii.xvi-p148"></span>25.  For it became Him who is most pure,
and a teacher of purity, to have come forth from a pure bride-chamber. 
For if he who well fulfils the office of a priest of Jesus abstains from
a wife, how should Jesus Himself be born of man and woman?  *For thou*,
saith He in the Psalms, art *He that took Me out of the womb* <span
id="fr_1456"></span>[1457](#fn_1456.md) .  Mark that carefully, He that
took Me out of the womb, signifying that He was begotten without man,
being taken from a virgin’s womb and flesh.  For the manner is different
with those who are begotten according to the course of marriage.

<span id="ii.xvi-p150"></span>26.  And from such members He is not
ashamed to assume flesh, who is the framer of those very members.  But
then who telleth us this?  The Lord saith unto Jeremiah:  *Before I
formed thee in the belly, I knew thee:  and before thou camest forth out
of the womb, I sanctified thee* <span
id="fr_1457"></span>[1458](#fn_1457.md) .  If, then, in fashioning man He
was not ashamed of the contact, was He ashamed in fashioning for His own
sake the holy Flesh, the veil of His Godhead?  It is God who even now
creates the children in the womb, as it is written in Job, *Hast thou
not poured me out as milk, and curdled me like cheese?  Thou hast
clothed me with skin and flesh, and hast knit me together with bones and
sinews* <span id="fr_1458"></span>[1459](#fn_1458.md) .  There is nothing
polluted in the human frame except a man defile this with fornication
and adultery.  He who formed Adam formed Eve also, and male and female
were formed by God’s hands.  None of the members of the body as formed
from the beginning is polluted.  Let the mouths of all heretics be
stopped who slander their bodies, or rather Him who formed them.  But
let us remember Paul’s saying, *Know ye not that your bodies are the
temples of the Holy Ghost which is in you* <span
id="fr_1459"></span>[1460](#fn_1459.md) ?  And again the Prophet hath
spoken before in the person of Jesus, *My flesh is from them* <span
id="fr_1460"></span>[1461](#fn_1460.md) :  and in another place it is
written, *Therefore will He give them up, until the time that she
bringeth forth* <span id="fr_1461"></span>[1462](#fn_1461.md) .  And what
is the sign?  He tells us in what follows, *She shall bring forth, and
the remnant of their brethren shall return*.  And what are the nuptial
pledges of the Virgin, the holy bride?  *And I will betroth thee unto Me
in faithfulness* <span id="fr_1462"></span>[1463](#fn_1462.md) .  And
Elizabeth, talking with Mary, speaks in like manner:  *And blessed is
she that believed; for there shall be a performance of those things
which were told her from the Lord* <span
id="fr_1463"></span>[1464](#fn_1463.md) .

<span id="ii.xvi-p158"></span>27.  But both Greeks and Jews harass us
and say that it was impossible for the Christ to be born of a virgin. 
As for the Greeks we will stop their mouths from their own fables.  For
ye who say that stones being thrown were changed into men <span
id="fr_1464"></span>[1465](#fn_1464.md) , how say ye that it is impossible
for a virgin to bring forth?  Ye who fable that a daughter was born from
the brain <span id="fr_1465"></span>[1466](#fn_1465.md) , how say ye that
it is impossible for a son to have been born from a virgin’s womb?  Ye
who falsely say that Dionysus was born from the thigh of your Zeus <span
id="fr_1466"></span>[1467](#fn_1466.md) , how set ye at nought our truth? 
I know that I am speaking of things unworthy of the present audience: 
but in order that thou in due season mayest rebuke the Greeks, we have
brought these things forward answering them from their own fables.

<span id="ii.xvi-p162"></span>28.  But those of the circumcision meet
thou with this question:  Whether is harder, for an aged woman, barren
and past age, to bear, or for a virgin in the prime of youth to
conceive?  Sarah was barren, and though it had ceased to be with her
after the manner of women, yet, contrary to nature, she bore a child. 
If, then, it is against nature for a barren woman to conceive, and also
for a virgin, either, therefore, reject both, or accept both.  For it is
the same God <span id="fr_1467"></span>[1468](#fn_1467.md) who both wrought
the one and appointed the other.  For thou wilt not dare to say that it
was possible for God in that former case, and impossible in this
latter.  And again:  how is it natural for a man’s hand to be changed in
a single hour into a different appearance and restored again?  How then
was the hand of Moses made white as snow, and at once restored again? 
But thou sayest that God’s will made the change.  In that case God’s
will has the power, and has it then no power in this case?  That
moreover was a sign concerning the Egyptians only, but this was a sign
given to the whole world.  But whether is the more difficult, O ye
Jews?  For a virgin to bear, or for a rod to be quickened into a living
creature?  Ye confess that in the case of Moses a perfectly straight rod
became <span id="page_80">p. 80</span> <span
id="ii.xvi-Page_80"></span>like a serpent, and was terrible to him who
cast it down, and he who before held the rod fast, fled from it as from
a serpent; for a serpent in truth it was:  but he fled not because he
feared that which he held, but because he dreaded Him that had changed
it.  A rod had teeth and eyes like a serpent:  do then seeing eyes grow
out of a rod, and cannot a child be born of a virgin’s womb, if God
wills?  For I say nothing of the fact that Aaron’s rod also produced in
a single night what other trees produce in several years.  For who knows
not that a rod, after losing its bark, will never sprout, not even if it
be planted in the midst of rivers?  But since God is not dependent on
the nature of trees, but is the Creator of their natures, the
unfruitful, and dry, and barkless rod budded, and blossomed, and bare
almonds.  He, then, who for the sake of the typical high-priest gave
fruit supernaturally to the rod, would He not for the sake of the true
High-Priest grant to the Virgin to bear a child?

<span id="ii.xvi-p164"></span>29.  These are excellent suggestions of
the narratives:  but the Jews still contradict, and do not yield to the
statements concerning the rod, unless they may be persuaded by similar
strange and supernatural births.  Question them, therefore, in this
way:  of whom in the beginning was Eve begotten?  What mother conceived
her the motherless?  But the Scripture saith that she was born out of
Adam’s side.  Is Eve then born out of a man’s side without a mother, and
is a child not to be born without a father, of a virgin’s womb?  This
debt of gratitude was due to men from womankind:  for Eve was begotten
of Adam, and not conceived of a mother, but as it were brought forth of
man alone.  Mary, therefore, paid the debt, of gratitude, when not by
man but of herself alone in an immaculate way she conceived of the Holy
Ghost by the power of God.

<span id="ii.xvi-p165"></span>30.  But let us take what is yet a greater
wonder than this.  For that of bodies bodies should be conceived, even
if wonderful, is nevertheless possible:  but that the dust of the earth
should become a man, this is more wonderful.  That clay moulded together
should assume the coats and splendours of the eyes, this is more
wonderful.  That out of dust of uniform appearance should be produced
both the firmness of bones, and the softness of lungs, and other
different kinds of members, this is wonderful.  That clay should be
animated and travel round the world self moved, and should build houses,
this is wonderful.  That clay should teach, and talk, and act as
carpenter, and as king, this is wonderful.  Whence, then, O ye most
ignorant Jews, was Adam made?  Did not God take dust from the earth, and
fashion this wonderful frame?  Is then clay changed into an eye, and
cannot a virgin bear a son.  Does that which for men is more impossible
take place, and is that which is possible never to occur?

<span id="ii.xvi-p166"></span>31.  Let us remember these things,
brethren:  let us use these weapons in our defence.  Let us not endure
those heretics who teach Christ’s coming as a phantom.  Let us abhor
those also who say that the Saviour’s birth was of husband and wife; who
have dared to say that He was the child of Joseph and Mary, because it
is written, *And he took unto him his wife* <span
id="fr_1468"></span>[1469](#fn_1468.md) .  For let us remember Jacob who
before he received Rachel, said to Laban, *Give me my wife* <span
id="fr_1469"></span>[1470](#fn_1469.md) .  For as she before the wedded
state, merely because there was a promise, was called the wife of Jacob,
so also Mary, because she had been betrothed, was called the wife of
Joseph.  Mark also the accuracy of the Gospel, saying, *And in the sixth
month the Angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named
Nazareth, to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph* <span
id="fr_1470"></span>[1471](#fn_1470.md) , and so forth.  And again when the
census took place, and Joseph went up to enrol himself, what saith the
Scripture?  *And Joseph also went up from Galilee, to enrol himself with
Mary who was espoused to him, being great with child* <span
id="fr_1471"></span>[1472](#fn_1471.md) .  For though she was with child,
yet it said not “with his wife,” but with her who was *espoused to
him*.  For *God sent forth His Son*, says Paul, not made of a man and a
woman, but *made of a woman* <span id="fr_1472"></span>[1473](#fn_1472.md)
only, that is of a virgin.  For that the virgin also is called a woman,
we shewed before <span id="fr_1473"></span>[1474](#fn_1473.md) .  For He
who makes souls virgin, was born of a Virgin.

<span id="ii.xvi-p173"></span>32.  But thou wonderest at the event: 
even she herself who bare him wondered at this.  For she saith to
Gabriel, *How shall this be to me, since I know not a man?*  But he
says, *The Holy Ghost shall came upon thee, and the power of the Highest
shall overshadow thee:  wherefore also the holy thing which is to be
born shall be called the Son of God* <span
id="fr_1474"></span>[1475](#fn_1474.md) .  Immaculate and undefiled was His
generation:  for where the Holy Spirit breathes, there all pollution is
taken away:  undefiled from the Virgin was the incarnate generation of
the Only-begotten.  And if the heretics gainsay the truth, the Holy
Ghost shall convict them:  that overshadowing power of the Highest shall
wax wroth:  Gabriel shall stand face to face against them in the day of
judgment:  the place of the manger, which received the Lord, shall put
them to shame.  The shepherds, who then received the good tidings, shall
bear witness; and the host of the Angels who sang praises and hymns, and
said, <span id="page_81">p. 81</span> <span
id="ii.xvi-Page_81"></span>*Glory to God in the highest, and on earth
peace among men of His good pleasure* <span
id="fr_1475"></span>[1476](#fn_1475.md) :  the Temple into which He was
then carried up on the fortieth day:  the pairs of turtle-doves, which
were offered on His behalf <span id="fr_1476"></span>[1477](#fn_1476.md) : 
and Symeon who then took Him up in his arms, and Anna the prophetess who
was present.

<span id="ii.xvi-p177"></span>33.  Since God then beareth witness, and
the Holy Ghost joins in the witness, and Christ says, *Why do ye seek to
kill me, a man who has told you the truth* <span
id="fr_1477"></span>[1478](#fn_1477.md) ? let the heretics be silenced who
speak against His humanity, for they speak against Him, who saith,
*Handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me
have* <span id="fr_1478"></span>[1479](#fn_1478.md) .  Adored be the Lord
the Virgin-born, and let Virgins acknowledge the crown of their own
state:  let the order also of Solitaries acknowledge the glory of
chastity for we men are not deprived of the dignity of chastity.  In the
Virgin’s womb the Saviour’s period of nine months was passed:  but the
Lord was for thirty and three years a man:  so that if a virgin
glories <span id="fr_1479"></span>[1480](#fn_1479.md) because of the nine
months, much more we because of the many years.

<span id="ii.xvi-p181"></span>34.  But let us all by God’s grace run the
race of chastity, *young men and maidens, old men and children* <span
id="fr_1480"></span>[1481](#fn_1480.md) ; not going after wantonness, but
praising the name of Christ.  Let us not be ignorant of the glory of
chastity:  for its crown is angelic, and its excellence above man.  Let
us be chary of our bodies which are to shine as the sun:  let us not for
short pleasure defile so great, so noble a body:  for short and
momentary is the sin, but the shame for many years and for ever.  Angels
walking upon earth are they who practise chastity:  the Virgins have
their portion with Mary the Virgin.  Let all vain ornament be banished,
and every hurtful glance, and all wanton gait, and every flowing robe,
and perfume enticing to pleasure.  But in all for perfume let there be
the prayer of sweet odour, and the practice <span
id="fr_1481"></span>[1482](#fn_1481.md) of good works, and the
sanctification of our bodies:  that the Virgin-born Lord may say even of

<span id="ii.xvi-p6"></span> This passage supplies a complete answer to
the suspicion of a quasi-Nestorian tendency referred to in note 6, on
xi. 20.  See x. 19, note 2, on the title <span class="Greek"><span

<span id="ii.xvi-p7"></span> The Present Participle (<span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.xvi-p7.1"></span>καταξιούμενοι</span>) means
that the Candidates for Baptism were already on the way to be admitted
to Holy Communion.  Compare Cat. i. 1, where the same Candidates are
addressed as “partakers of the mysteries of Christ, as yet by calling
only, but ere long by grace also.”

<span id="ii.xvi-p8"></span> Aubertin remarks on this passage that “this
spiritual Lamb, consisting of head and feet, can be received only by the
spiritual mouth.”  This explanation, however true in itself, cannot
fairly be held to express fully the meaning of Cyril.  See the section
of the Introduction referred to in the Index, “Eucharist.”

head with the feet*.  The same figurative interpretation is given by
Eusebius (*Eccl. Hist*. I. ii. § 1):  “In Christ there is a twofold
nature; and the one—in so far as He is thought of as God—resembles the
head of the body, while the other may be compared with the feet,—in so
far as He, for the sake of our salvation, put on human nature with the
same passions as our own.”

id="ii.xvi-p20.2"></span>

<span id="ii.xvi-p21"></span> Dr. Swainson (*Creeds*, Chap. vii. § 7),
speaking of the Creed of Cyril of Jerusalem, says that “the words <span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.xvi-p21.1"></span>σαρκωθέντα καὶ
ἐνανθρωπήσαντα</span> are found in it, but no reference whatever is made
to the birth from the Virgin.”  The present passage, and that in Cat.
iv. § 9, “begotten of the Holy Virgin and the Holy Ghost,” seems to shew
that such a clause formed part of the Creed which Cyril was expounding. 
The genuineness of both passages is attested by all the <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.xvi-p21.2"></span>mss.</span> and Dr. Swainson
was mistaken in charging the Editors of the Oxford Translation with
having omitted to “mention that Touttée was himself doubtful as to the
words within the brackets” \[<span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.xvi-p21.3"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.xvi-p21.4"></span>κ Παρθένου καὶ Πνεύματος ῾Αγίου</span>\].  The
brackets are added by Dr. Swainson himself, and Touttée had no doubt of
the genuineness of the words:  on the contrary he believed them to be
part of the Creed itself.  His note is as follows:  “The words *of the
Virgin and Holy Ghost* I have caused to be printed in larger letters as
if taken from the Symbol:  although they are wanting in the Title of
this Lecture and in § 13, where the third Article of the Creed is
referred to.  But they are read in nearly all the Latin and Greek
Symbols, and are referred to in Cat. iv. § 9.”

<span id="fn_1353"></span>[73:1354](2070028.htm#fr_1353.md) <span
id="ii.xvi-p21.6"></span>

<span id="ii.xvi-p22"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.xvi-p22.1"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.xvi-p22.2"></span>νανθρωπήσαντα</span>.  The word occurs in the
true Nicene formula, where, as Dr. Swainson thinks, it is “scarcely
ambiguous,” “it is defective.”  Both the Verb and the Substantive <span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.xvi-p22.3"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.xvi-p22.4"></span>νανθρώπησις</span> are
constantly used by Athanasius to denote the Incarnation in a perfectly
general way, without any indication of ambiguity or defect.  In the
Creed proposed by Eusebius of Cæsarea instead of <span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.xvi-p22.5"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.xvi-p22.6"></span>νανθρωπήσαντα</span> we
find <span class="Greek"><span id="ii.xvi-p22.7"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.xvi-p22.8"></span>ν ἀνθρώποις
πολιτευσάμενον</span>; and in the *Expositio Fidei* ascribed to
Athanasius, but of somewhat doubtful authenticity, the Incarnation is
described thus <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.xvi-p22.9"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.xvi-p22.10"></span>κ τῆς ἀχράντου παρθένου Μαρίας τὸν ἡμέτερον
ἀνείληφεν ἄνθρωπον Χριστὸν ᾽Ιησοῦν</span>.  In the Apollinarian
controversy the attempt was made to interpret <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.xvi-p22.11"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.xvi-p22.12"></span>νηνθρώπησεν</span> as meaning not that “He
became Man,” but that “He assumed a man,” *i.e.* that “the man was first
formed and then assumed” (Gregory, *Epist. ad Cledon*, quoted by
Swainson, p. 83), or else merely that “He dwelt among men.”  But the
context of the passages in which Cyril uses the word (iv. 9; xii. 3)
clearly shews that he employed it in the perfectly orthodox sense which
it has in the Nicene Formula and in Athanasius.

<span id="fn_1354"></span>[73:1355](2070028.htm#fr_1354.md) <span
id="ii.xvi-p22.13"></span>

<span id="ii.xvi-p23"></span> See below, § 21 ff.  Cyril means that the
direct proof cannot be given at once, because there are many errors to
be set aside first.  Compare the end of § 4.

id="ii.xvi-p24.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xvi-p25"></span> Athanasius (*contra Arian. Or.* I. § 9)
quotes as from Arius, *Thalia*, “Christ is not Very God, but He, as
others, was made God (<span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.xvi-p25.1"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.xvi-p25.2"></span>θεοποιήθη</span> ) by participation.”  The
Eusebians in the Confession of Faith called Macrostichos (<span
class="sc"><span id="ii.xvi-p25.3"></span>a.d.</span> 344) condemned
this view as being held by the disciples of Paul of Samosata, “who say
that after the incarnation He was by advance made God, from being made
by nature a mere man.”  The orthodox use of the word <span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.xvi-p25.4"></span>Θεοποιεῖσθαι</span> is seen
in Athan. *de Incarnat.* § 54:  <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.xvi-p25.5"></span>αὐτὸς ἐνηνθρώπησεν, ἵνα ἡμεῖς
θεοποιηθῶμεν</span>.

immutability.  But the meaning of the passage is not clear, and the

The passage is interpreted by Cyril (xi. 5) of the eternal generation of
the Son:  here it refers to His Incarnation, or perhaps is meant only to
identify the Son of God with him who “shall rule with a rod of iron.”

“Darius the Mede.”  He also fails to distinguish the rebuilding of the
Temple, <span class="sc"><span id="ii.xvi-p114.6"></span>b.c.</span>
516, from the rebuilding of the City by permission of Artaxerxes

<span id="ii.xvi-p115"></span> In speaking of three supernumeracy hours
in the year instead of nearly six, Cyril seems to follow the division of
the diurnal period into twelve parts, not twenty-four.  The Jews had
derived this division either from the Egyptians, or more probably from
the Babylonians:  see Herodotus, II. 109.

The Psalmist refers to the recovery of the Ark, but Cyril interprets the
passage mystically of Christ, and the place of His Nativity.

<span id="fn_1432"></span>[77:1433](2070028.htm#fr_1432.md) <span
id="ii.xvi-p118.2"></span>

<span id="ii.xvi-p119"></span> The Benedictine Editor thinks that in
calling the place “woody” Cyril refers to a grove planted by Hadrian in
honour of Adonis, which had been destroyed about sixteen years before,
when Helena built the Church at Bethlehem:  see Eusebius, *Life of
Constantine*, III. 43.  But Cyril evidently means that the wood of which
the Psalmist speaks had remained till a few years before.  Ephrâthah is
the ancient name of Bethlehem ([Gen.
35:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#019.md), [Gen.
48:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#007)<span id="ii.xvi-p119.1"></span>.md),
and by “the fields of the wood” is probably meant Kirjath-Jearim, “the
city of woods,” where the Ark was found by David ([2 Sam.
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#002.md), [1 Chr.

<span id="ii.xvi-p120"></span> [Hab. iii.

(R.V.) *O Lord, revive Thy work in the midst of the years, in the midst
of the years make it known.*  The Septuagint gives a different sense: 
*In the midst of two lives* (or, *living beings*) *shalt Thou be known: 
when the years draw nigh Thou shalt be recognised:  when the time is
come, Thou shalt be shewn.*  The two latter clauses seem to be different
renderings of the same Hebrew words.

id="ii.xvi-p121.1"></span>ἑ</span><span class="Greek"><span

preceding quotation:  Cyril misplaces them.  In the Vatican and other
<span class="sc"><span id="ii.xvi-p121.3"></span>mss.</span> of the
Sept. and in some Fathers <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.xvi-p121.4"></span>ζώων</span> (“living creatures”) is found in
place of <span class="Greek"><span id="ii.xvi-p121.5"></span>ζωῶν</span>
“lives;” but the latter reading is evidently required by the
interpretation which follows in Cyril.  Origen (*de Principiis,* I. 4),
who recognises both readings (“In medio vel duorum animalium, vel duarum
vitarum, cognosceris,”) interprets the “two living beings” of the Son
and the Spirit.  Eusebius (*Demonstr. Evang* VI. 15) observes that <span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.xvi-p121.6"></span>ζωων</span> is to be read
as perispomenon from the Singular <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.xvi-p121.7"></span>ζωή</span>, and interprets it of Christ’s life
with God, and life on earth.  Theodoret says, in commenting on the
passage, “To me it seems that the Prophet means not “living beings”
(<span class="Greek"><span id="ii.xvi-p121.8"></span>ζῶα</span>) but
“lives” (<span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.xvi-p121.9"></span>ζωάς</span>), the present life, and that which
is to come, between which is the appearance of the Righteous Judge.”

id="ii.xvi-p122.3"></span>ןמָיתּ”</span>) as a common Noun meaning
“South,” and the Vulgate has here “ab Austro veniet.”  The prophecy is
thus referred to Bethlehem, as lying to the South of Jerusalem.

<span id="ii.xvi-p123"></span> The following note is slightly abridged
from the Edition of Alexandrides of Jerusalem.  “Previous Editions read
<span class="Greek"><span id="ii.xvi-p123.1"></span>ἔ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.xvi-p123.2"></span>ξ ὄρους φαρὰν κατασκίου

Septuagint, but <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.xvi-p123.4"></span>φαράν</span> is omitted in the Aldine and many
other copies nor was it read in the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.xvi-p123.5"></span>mss.</span> of the Sept. in Jerome’s time, as
is clear from his comments on the passage.  In the <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.xvi-p123.6"></span>mss.</span> of Cyril, Ottob.
<span class="sc"><span id="ii.xvi-p123.7"></span>R.C.V.</span> Monac. I.
and II. it is wanting.  Paran is the name of the desert towards the S.
of Palestine lying between it and Egypt ([Gen.
21:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#021.md), [Num.
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/num001.htm#012.md)<span
id="ii.xvi-p123.8"></span>).  There was also a Mount Paran ([Deut.
xxxiii. 2](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#002.md)<span
id="ii.xvi-p123.9"></span>).  But since Cyril applies the prophecy to
Bethlehem, and the “shady thickly-wooded mountain” of Habakkuk is
identified with “the plains of the wood” of David, we may safely
conclude that Cyril did not read <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.xvi-p123.10"></span>φαράν</span> in his copies of the Septuagint,
nor write it in his Lecture:  but the reading crept in from the later
copyists, accustomed to the reading <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.xvi-p123.11"></span>φαράν</span> in the Septuagint.”

The objection of the Jews that the Hebrew word “Almah” means “a young
woman,” whether married or not, is mentioned by Justin M. (*Tryph*. 43,
67, 71), and by Eusebius (*Dem. Evang*. VII. i. 315).

4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#004.md)<span id="ii.xvi-p128.1"></span>. 
Cyril’s argument is fully justified by the actual usage of “Almah,”
which certainly refers to unmarried women in [Gen.
24:43](../../../bib/kjv/gen024.htm#043.md), [Exod.
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#008.md), [Cant.
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#003.md)<span id="ii.xvi-p128.2"></span>. 
The same is probably the meaning in [Ps. lxviii.
25](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#025.md)<span id="ii.xvi-p128.3"></span>: 
“in the midst were the damsels playing with the timbrels.”  There is no
passage in which the word can be shewn to mean a married woman.
