id="iv.iv.ii.iv-p1.1"></span>Ep. LXXIV.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.ii.iv-p2"></span>Although I am at home, my love is
expatriated with you, for affection makes us have all things common. 
Trusting in the mercy of God, and in your prayers, I have great hopes
that all will turn out according to your mind, and that the hurricane
will be turned into a gentle breeze, and that God will give you this
reward for your orthodoxy, that you will overcome your opponents.  Most
of all I long to see you shortly, and to have a good time with you, as I
pray.  But if you delay owing to the pressure of affairs, at any rate
cheer me by a letter, and do not disdain to tell me all about your
circumstances, and to pray for me, as you are accustomed to do.  May God
grant you health and good spirits in all circumstances,—you who are the
common prop of the whole Church.
