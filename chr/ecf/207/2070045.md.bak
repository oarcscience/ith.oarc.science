<span id="iii.ii.iii-p2"></span>There are perhaps more MSS. of the works
of Gregory than of any other Father.  The great Benedictine Edition of
his works contains long lists of MSS., and of Versions, and previous
Editions.  The most famous of these is that of the Abbat Jacobus Billius
in 1589, which was accompanied by the Scholia of Nicetas, etc.  In 1571
Leuvenklavius published an edition at Basle containing the Scholia of
Elias Cretensis and others.  In 1778 appeared the first volume of the
great Edition of the Benedictine Fathers of the Abbey of S. Maur near
Paris, which had been in preparation ever since 1708.  But the Monks
were driven away by <span id="page_202">p. 202</span> <span
id="iii.ii.iii-Page_202"></span>the French Revolution, and the second
volume did not appear till 1842.  It has been reprinted in Migne’s
“Patrologia Græca,” vols. 35–38.  Of modern works on the life and
writings of our Saint, the best are those of Dr. Ullmann, and that of
the Abbé Benoît.  A valuable comparison of Gregory and Basil is to be
found in Newman’s “Church of the Fathers,” and last, but not least in
value, may be mentioned the long biographical article by Professor
Watkins in Smith’s “Dictionary of Christian Biography,” and a useful
short summary in Schaff’s Church History (311–600, vol. ii.).
