<span id="iv.ii.iii"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.ii.iii-p1.1"></span>To Cledonius the Priest Against
Apollinarius.  (Ep. CI.)</span>

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p2"></span>To our most reverend and God-beloved
brother and fellow-priest Cledonius, Gregory, greeting in the Lord.

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p3"></span>I desire to learn what is this fashion of
innovation in things Concerning the Church, which allows anyone who
likes, or the passerby, <span id="fr_4696"></span>[4697](#fn_4696.md) as
the Bible says, to tear asunder the flock that has been well led, and to
plunder it by larcenous attacks, or rather by piratical and fallacious
teachings.  For if our present assailants had any ground for condemning
us in regard of the faith, it would not have been right for them, even
in that case, to have ventured on such a course without giving us
notice.  They ought rather to have first persuaded us, or to have been
willing to be persuaded by us (if at least any account is to be taken of
us as fearing God, labouring for the faith, and helping the Church), and
then, if at all, to innovate; but then perhaps there would be an excuse
for their outrageous conduct.  But since our faith has been proclaimed,
both in writing and without writing, here and in distant parts, in times
of danger and of safety, how comes it that some make such attempts, and
that others keep silence?

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p5"></span>The most grievous part of it is not
(though this too is shocking) that the men instil their own heresy into
simpler souls by means of those who are worse; but that they also tell
lies about us and say that we share their opinions and sentiments; thus
baiting their hooks, and by this cloak villainously fulfilling their
will, and making our simplicity, which looked upon them as brothers and
not as foes, into a support of their wickedness.  And not only so, but
they also assert, as I am told, that they have been received by the
Western Synod, by which they were formerly condemned, as is well known
to everyone.  If, however, those who hold the views of Apollinarius have
either now or formerly been received, let them prove it and we will be
content.  For it is evident that they can only have been so received as
assenting to the Orthodox Faith, for this were an impossibility on any
other terms.  And they can surely prove it, either by the minutes of the
Synod, or by Letters of Communion, for this is the regular custom of
Synods.  But if it is mere words, and an invention of their own, devised
for the sake of appearances and to give them weight with the multitude
through the credit of the persons, teach them to hold their tongues, and
confute them; for we believe that such a task is well suited to your
manner of life and orthodoxy.  Do not let the men deceive themselves and
others with the assertion that the “Man of the Lord,” as they call Him,
Who is rather our Lord and God, is without human mind.  For we do not
sever the Man from the Godhead, but we lay down as a dogma the Unity and
Identity of Person, Who of old was not Man but God, and the Only Son
before all ages, unmingled with body or anything corporeal; but Who in
these last days has assumed Manhood also for our salvation; passible in
His Flesh, impassible in His Godhead; circumscript in the body,
uncircumscript in the Spirit; at once earthly and heavenly, tangible and
intangible, comprehensible and incomprehensible; that by One and the
Same Person, Who was perfect Man and also God, the entire humanity
fallen through sin might be created anew.

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p6"></span>If anyone does not believe that Holy Mary
is the Mother of God, he is severed from the Godhead.  If anyone should
assert that He passed through the Virgin as through a channel, and was
not at once divinely and humanly formed in her (divinely, because
without the intervention of a man; humanly, because in accordance with
the laws of gestation), he is in like manner godless.  If any assert
that the Manhood was formed and afterward was clothed with the Godhead,
he too is to be condemned.  For this were not a Generation of God, but a
shirking of generation.  If any introduce the notion of Two Sons, one of
God the Father, the other of the Mother, and discredits the Unity and
Identity, may he lose his part in the adoption promised to those who
believe aright.  For God and Man are two natures, as also soul and body
are; but there are not two Sons or two Gods.  For neither in this life
are there two manhoods; though Paul speaks in some such language of the
inner and outer man.  And (if I am to speak concisely) the Saviour is
made of elements which are distinct from one another (for the invisible
is not the same with the visible, nor the timeless with that which is
subject to time), yet He is not two Persons.  God forbid!  For both
natures are one by the combination, the Deity being made Man, and the
Manhood <span id="page_440">p. 440</span> <span
id="iv.ii.iii-Page_440"></span>deified or however one should express
it.  And I say different Elements, because it is the reverse of what is
the case in the Trinity; for There we acknowledge different Persons so
as not to confound the persons; but not different Elements, for the
Three are One and the same in Godhead.

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p7"></span>If any should say that it wrought in Him
by grace as in a Prophet, but was not and is not united with Him in
Essence—let him be empty of the Higher Energy, or rather full of the
opposite.  If any worship not the Crucified, let him be Anathema and be
numbered among the Deicides.  If any assert that He was made perfect by
works, or that after His Baptism, or after His Resurrection from the
dead, He was counted worthy of an adoptive Sonship, like those whom the
Greeks interpolate as added to the ranks of the gods, let him be
anathema.  For that which has a beginning or a progress or is made
perfect, is not God, although the expressions may be used of His gradual
manifestation.  If any assert that He has now put off His holy flesh,
and that His Godhead is stripped of the body, and deny that He is now
with His body and will come again with it, let him not see the glory of
His Coming.  For where is His body now, if not with Him Who assumed it? 
For it is not laid by in the sun, according to the babble of the
Manichæans, that it should be honoured by a dishonour; nor was it poured
forth into the air and dissolved, as is the nature of a voice or the
flow of an odour, or the course of a lightning flash that never stands. 
Where in that case were His being handled after the Resurrection, or His
being seen hereafter by them that pierced Him, for Godhead is in its
nature invisible.  Nay; He will come with His body—so I have learnt—such
as He was seen by His Disciples in the Mount, or as he shewed Himself
for a moment, when his Godhead overpowered the carnality.  And as we say
this to disarm suspicion, so we write the other to correct the novel
teaching.  If anyone assert that His flesh came down from heaven, and is
not from hence, nor of us though above us, let him be anathema.  For the
words, The Second Man is the Lord from Heaven; <span
id="fr_4697"></span>[4698](#fn_4697.md) and, As is the Heavenly, such are
they that are Heavenly; and, No man hath ascended up into Heaven save He
which came down from Heaven, even the Son of Man which is in
Heaven; <span id="fr_4698"></span>[4699](#fn_4698.md) and the like, are to
be understood as said on account of the Union with the heavenly; just as
that All Things were made by Christ, <span
id="fr_4699"></span>[4700](#fn_4699.md) and that Christ dwelleth in your
hearts <span id="fr_4700"></span>[4701](#fn_4700.md) is said, not of the
visible nature which belongs to God, but of what is perceived by the
mind, the names being mingled like the natures, and flowing into one
another, according to the law of their intimate union.

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p12"></span>If anyone has put his trust in Him as a
Man without a human mind, he is really bereft of mind, and quite
unworthy of salvation.  For that which He has not assumed He has not
healed; but that which is united to His Godhead is also saved.  If only
half Adam fell, then that which Christ assumes and saves may be half
also; but if the whole of his nature fell, it must be united to the
whole nature of Him that was begotten, and so be saved as a whole.  Let
them not, then, begrudge us our complete salvation, or clothe the
Saviour only with bones and nerves and the portraiture of humanity.  For
if His Manhood is without soul, even the Arians admit this, that they
may attribute His Passion to the Godhead, as that which gives motion to
the body is also that which suffers.  But if He has a soul, and yet is
without a mind, how is He man, for man is not a mindless animal?  And
this would necessarily involve that while His form and tabernacle was
human, His soul should be that of a horse or an ox, or some other of the
brute creation.  This, then, would be what He saves; and I have been
deceived by the Truth, and led to boast of an honour which had been
bestowed upon another.  But if His Manhood is intellectual and nor
without mind, let them cease to be thus really mindless.  But, says such
an one, the Godhead took the place of the human intellect.  How does
this touch me?  For Godhead joined to flesh alone is not man, nor to
soul alone, nor to both apart from intellect, which is the most
essential part of man.  Keep then the whole man, and mingle Godhead
therewith, that you may benefit me in my completeness.  But, he asserts,
He could not contain Two perfect Natures.  Not if you only look at Him
in a bodily fashion.  For a bushel measure will not hold two bushels,
nor will the space of one body hold two or more bodies.  But if you will
look at what is mental and incorporeal, remember that I in my one
personality can contain soul and reason and mind and the Holy Spirit;
and before me this world, by which I mean the system of things visible
and invisible, contained Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.  For such is the
nature of intellectual Existences, that they can mingle with one another
and with bodies, in<span id="page_441">p. 441</span> <span
id="iv.ii.iii-Page_441"></span>corporeally and invisibly.  For many
sounds are comprehended by one ear; and the eyes of many are occupied by
the same visible objects, and the smell by odours; nor are the senses
narrowed by each other, or crowded out, nor the objects of sense
diminished by the multitude of the perceptions.  But where is there mind
of man or angel so perfect in comparison of the Godhead that the
presence of the greater must crowd out the other?  The light is nothing
compared with the sun, nor a little damp compared with a river, that we
must first do away with the lesser, and take the light from a house, or
the moisture from the earth, to enable it to contain the greater and
more perfect.  For how shall one thing contain two completenesses,
either the house, the sunbeam and the sun, or the earth, the moisture
and the river?  Here is matter for inquiry; for indeed the question is
worthy of much consideration.  Do they not know, then, that what is
perfect by comparison with one thing may be imperfect by comparison with
another, as a hill compared with a mountain, or a grain of mustard seed
with a bean or any other of the larger seeds, although it may be called
larger than any of the same kind?  Or, if you like, an Angel compared
with God, or a man with an Angel.  So our mind is perfect and
commanding, but only in respect of soul and body; not absolutely
perfect; and a servant and a subject of God, not a sharer of His
Princedom and honour.  So Moses was a God to Pharaoh, <span
id="fr_4701"></span>[4702](#fn_4701.md) but a servant of God, <span
id="fr_4702"></span>[4703](#fn_4702.md) as it is written; and the stars
which illumine the night are hidden by the Sun, so much that you could
not even know of their existence by daylight; and a little torch brought
near a great blaze is neither destroyed, nor seen, nor extinguished; but
is all one blaze, the bigger one prevailing over the other.

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p15"></span>But, it may be said, our mind is subject
to condemnation.  What then of our flesh?  Is that not subject to
condemnation?  You must therefore either set aside the latter on account
of sin, or admit the former on account of salvation.  If He assumed the
worse that He might sanctify it by His incarnation, may He not assume
the better that it may be sanctified by His becoming Man?  If the clay
was leavened and has become a new lump, O ye wise men, shall not the
Image be leavened and mingled with God, being deified by His Godhead? 
And I will add this also:  If the mind was utterly rejected, as prone to
sin and subject to damnation, and for this reason He assumed a body but
left out the mind, then there is an excuse for them who sin with the
mind; for the witness of God—according to you—has shewn the
impossibility of healing it.  Let me state the greater results.  You, my
good sir, dishonour my mind (you a Sarcolater, if I am an
Anthropolater <span id="fr_4703"></span>[4704](#fn_4703) .md) that you may
tie God down to the Flesh, since He cannot be otherwise tied; and
therefore you take away the wall of partition.  But what is my theory,
who am but an ignorant man, and no Philosopher.  Mind is mingled with
mind, as nearer and more closely related, and through it with flesh,
being a Mediator between God and carnality.

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p17"></span>Further let us see what is their account
of the assumption of Manhood, or the assumption of Flesh, as they call
it.  If it was in order that God, otherwise incomprehensible, might be
comprehended, and might converse with men through His Flesh as through a
veil, their mask and the drama which they represent is a pretty one, not
to say that it was open to Him to converse with us in other ways, as of
old, in the burning bush <span id="fr_4704"></span>[4705](#fn_4704.md) and
in the appearance of a man. <span id="fr_4705"></span>[4706](#fn_4705.md)  
But if it was that He might destroy the condemnation by sanctifying like
by like, then as He needed flesh for the sake of the flesh which had
incurred condemnation, and soul for the sake of our soul, so, too, He
needed mind for the sake of mind, which not only fell in Adam, but was
the first to be affected, as the doctors say of illnesses.  For that
which received the command was that which failed to keep the command,
and that which failed to keep it was that also which dared to
transgress; and that which transgressed was that which stood most in
need of salvation; and that which needed salvation was that which also
He took upon Him.  Therefore, Mind was taken upon Him.  This has now
been demonstrated, whether they like it or no, by, to use their own
expression, geometrical and necessary proofs.  But you are acting as if,
when a man’s eye had been injured and his foot had been injured in
consequence, you were to attend to the foot and leave the eye uncared
for; or as if, when a painter had drawn something badly, you were to
alter the picture, but to pass over the artist as if he had succeeded. 
But if they, overwhelmed by these arguments, take refuge in the
proposition that it is possible for God to save man even apart <span
id="page_442">p. 442</span> <span id="iv.ii.iii-Page_442"></span>from
mind, why, I suppose that it would be possible for Him to do so also
apart from flesh by a mere act of will, just as He works all other
things, and has wrought them without body.  Take away, then, the flesh
as well as the mind, that your monstrous folly may be complete.  But
they are deceived by the latter, and, therefore, they run to the flesh,
because they do not know the custom of Scripture.  We will teach them
this also.  For what need is there even to mention to those who know it,
the fact that everywhere in Scripture he is called Man, and the Son of
Man?

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p20"></span>If, however, they rely on the passage,
The Word was made Flesh and dwelt among us, <span
id="fr_4706"></span>[4707](#fn_4706.md) and because of this erase the
noblest part of Man (as cobblers do the thicker part of skins) that they
may join together God and Flesh, it is time for them to say that God is
God only of flesh, and not of souls, because it is written, “As Thou
hast given Him power over all Flesh,” <span
id="fr_4707"></span>[4708](#fn_4707.md) and “Unto Thee shall all Flesh
come;” <span id="fr_4708"></span>[4709](#fn_4708.md) and “Let all Flesh
bless His holy Name,” <span id="fr_4709"></span>[4710](#fn_4709.md) meaning
every Man.  Or, again, they must suppose that our fathers went down into
Egypt without bodies and invisible, and that only the Soul of Joseph was
imprisoned by Pharaoh, because it is written, “They went down into Egypt
with threescore and fifteen Souls,” <span
id="fr_4710"></span>[4711](#fn_4710.md) and “The iron entered into his
Soul,” <span id="fr_4711"></span>[4712](#fn_4711.md) a thing which could
not be bound.  They who argue thus do not know that such expressions are
used by Synecdoche, declaring the whole by the part, as when Scripture
says that the young ravens call upon God, <span
id="fr_4712"></span>[4713](#fn_4712.md) to indicate the whole feathered
race; or Pleiades, Hesperus, and Arcturus <span
id="fr_4713"></span>[4714](#fn_4713.md) are mentioned, instead of all the
Stars and His Providence over them.

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p29"></span>Moreover, in no other way was it
possible for the Love of God toward us to be manifested than by making
mention of our flesh, and that for our sake He descended even to our
lower part.  For that flesh is less precious than soul, everyone who has
a spark of sense will acknowledge.  And so the passage, The Word was
made Flesh, seems to me to be equivalent to that in which it is said
that He was made sin, <span id="fr_4714"></span>[4715](#fn_4714.md) or a
curse <span id="fr_4715"></span>[4716](#fn_4715.md) for us; not that the
Lord was transformed into either of these, how could He be?  But because
by taking them upon Him He took away our sins and bore our
iniquities. <span id="fr_4716"></span>[4717](#fn_4716.md)   This, then, is
sufficient to say at the present time for the sake of clearness and of
being understood by the many.  And I write it, not with any desire to
compose a treatise, but only to check the progress of deceit; and if it
is thought well, I will give a fuller account of these matters at
greater length.

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p33"></span>But there is a matter which is graver
than these, a special point which it is necessary that I should not pass
over.  I would they were even cut off that trouble you, <span
id="fr_4717"></span>[4718](#fn_4717.md) and would reintroduce a second
Judaism, and a second circumcision, and a second system of sacrifices. 
For if this be done, what hinders Christ also being born again to set
them aside, and again being betrayed by Judas, and crucified and buried,
and rising again, that all may be fulfilled in the same order, like the
Greek system of cycles, in which the same revolutions of the stars bring
round the same events?  For what the method of selection is, in
accordance with which some of the events are to occur and others to be
omitted, let these wise men who glory in the multitude of their books
shew us.

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p35"></span>But since, puffed up by their theory of
the Trinity, they falsely accuse us of being unsound in the Faith and
entice the multitude, it is necessary that people should know that
Apollinarius, while granting the Name of Godhead to the Holy Ghost, did
not preserve the Power of the Godhead.  For to make the Trinity consist
of Great, Greater, and Greatest, as of Light, Ray, and Sun, the Spirit
and the Son and the Father (as is clearly stated in his writings), is a
ladder of Godhead not leading to Heaven, but down from Heaven.  But we
recognize God the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost, and these not
as bare titles, dividing inequalities of ranks or of power, but as there
is one and the same title, so there is one nature and one substance in
the Godhead.

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p36"></span>But if anyone who thinks we have spoken
rightly on this subject reproaches us with holding communion with
heretics, let him prove that we are open to this charge, and we will
either convince him or retire.  But it is not safe to make any
innovation before judgment is given, especially in a matter of such
importance, and connected with so great issues.  We have protested and
continue to protest this before God and men.  And not even now, be well
assured, should we have written this, if we had not seen that the Church
was being torn asunder and divided, among their other tricks, by their
present synagogue of vanity. <span id="fr_4718"></span>[4719](#fn_4718.md)
  But if anyone when we say and protest this, either from some advantage
they will thus gain, or through fear of men, or monstrous littleness of
<span id="page_443">p. 443</span> <span
id="iv.ii.iii-Page_443"></span>mind, or through some neglect of pastors
and governors, or through love of novelty and proneness to innovations,
rejects us as unworthy of credit, and attaches himself to such men, and
divides the noble body of the Church, he shall bear his judgment,
whoever he may be, <span id="fr_4719"></span>[4720](#fn_4719.md) and shall
give account to God in the day of judgment. <span
id="fr_4720"></span>[4721](#fn_4720.md)   But if their long books, and
their new Psalters, contrary to that of David, and the grace of their
metres, are taken for a third Testament, we too will compose Psalms, and
will write much in metre.  For we also think we have the spirit of
God, <span id="fr_4721"></span>[4722](#fn_4721.md) if indeed this is a gift
of the Spirit, and not a human novelty.  This I will that thou declare
publicly, that we may not be held responsible, as overlooking such an
evil, and as though this wicked doctrine received food and strength from
our indifference.
