<span id="ii.xvii-p4"></span>Who hath believed our report? and to whom
is the arm of the Lord revealed?…He is brought as a lamb to the
slaughter, &c.

<span id="ii.xvii-p5"></span>1.  <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.xvii-p5.1"></span>Every</span> deed of Christ is a cause of
glorying to the Catholic Church, but her greatest of all glorying is in
the Cross; and knowing this, Paul says, *But God forbid that I should
glory, save in the Cross of Christ* <span
id="fr_1483"></span>[1484](#fn_1483.md) .  For wondrous indeed it was, that
one who was blind from his birth should receive sight in Siloam <span
id="fr_1484"></span>[1485](#fn_1484.md) ; but what is this compared with
the blind of the whole world?  A great thing it was, and passing nature,
for Lazarus to rise again on the fourth day; but the grace extended to
him alone, and what was it compared with the dead in sins throughout the
world?  Marvellous it was, that five loaves should pour forth food for
the five thousand; but what is that to those who are famishing in
ignorance through all the world?  It was marvellous that she should have
been loosed who had been bound by Satan eighteen years:  yet what is
this to all of us, who were fast bound in the chains of our sins?  But
the glory of the Cross led those who were blind through ignorance into
light, loosed all who were held fast by sin, and ransomed the whole
world of mankind.

<span id="ii.xvii-p8"></span>2.  And wonder not that the whole world was
ransomed; for it was no mere man, but the only-begotten Son of God, who
died on its behalf.  Moreover one man’s sin, even Adam’s, had power to
bring death to the world; but *if by the trespass of the one death
reigned* over the world, how shall not life much rather reign *by the
righteousness of the One* <span id="fr_1485"></span>[1486](#fn_1485.md) ? 
And if because of the tree of food they were then cast out of paradise,
shall not believers now more easily enter into paradise because of the
Tree of Jesus?  If the first man formed out of the earth brought in
universal death, shall not He who formed him out of the earth bring in
eternal life, being Himself the Life?  If Phinees, when he waxed zealous
and slew the evil-doer, staved the wrath of God, shall not Jesus, who
slew not another, but *gave up Himself for a ransom* <span
id="fr_1486"></span>[1487](#fn_1486.md) , put away the wrath which is
against mankind?

<span id="ii.xvii-p11"></span>3.  Let us then not be ashamed of the
Cross of our Saviour, but rather glory in it.  *For the word of the
Cross is unto Jews a stumbling-block, and unto Gentiles foolishness*,
but to us salvation:  and *to them that are perishing it is foolishness,
but unto us which are being saved it is the power of God* <span
id="fr_1487"></span>[1488](#fn_1487.md) .  For it was not a mere man who
died for us, as I said before, but the Son of God, God made man. 
Further; if the lamb under Moses drove the destroyer <span
id="fr_1488"></span>[1489](#fn_1488.md) far away, did not much rather the
*Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world* <span
id="fr_1489"></span>[1490](#fn_1489.md) , deliver us from our sins?  The
blood of a silly sheep gave salvation; and shall not the Blood of the
Only-begotten much rather save?  If any disbelieve the power of the
Crucified, let him ask the devils; if any believe not words, let him
believe what he sees.  Many have been crucified throughout the world,
but by none of these are the devils scared; but when they see even the
Sign of the Cross of Christ, who was crucified for us, they
shudder <span id="fr_1490"></span>[1491](#fn_1490.md) .  For those men died
for their own sins, but Christ for the sins of others; for He *did no
sin, neither was guile found in His mouth* <span
id="fr_1491"></span>[1492](#fn_1491.md) .  It is not Peter who says this,
for then we might suspect that he was partial to his Teacher; but it is
Esaias who says it, who was not indeed present with Him in the flesh,
but in the Spirit foresaw His coming in the flesh.  Yet why now bring
the Prophet only as a witness? take for a witness Pilate himself, who
gave sentence upon Him, saying, *I find no fault in this Man* <span
id="fr_1492"></span>[1493](#fn_1492.md) :  and when he gave Him up, and had
washed his <span id="page_83">p. 83</span> <span
id="ii.xvii-Page_83"></span>hands, he said, *I am innocent of the blood
of this just person* <span id="fr_1493"></span>[1494](#fn_1493.md) .  There
is yet another witness of the sinlessness of Jesus,—the robber, the
first man admitted into Paradise; who rebuked his fellow, and said, “*We
receive the due reward of our deeds; but this man hath done nothing
amiss* <span id="fr_1494"></span>[1495](#fn_1494.md) ; for we were present,
both thou and I, at His judgment.”

<span id="ii.xvii-p20"></span>4.  Jesus then really suffered for all
men; for the Cross was no illusion <span
id="fr_1495"></span>[1496](#fn_1495.md) , otherwise our redemption is an
illusion also.  His death was not a mere show <span
id="fr_1496"></span>[1497](#fn_1496.md) , for then is our salvation also
fabulous.  If His death was but a show, they were true who said, *We
remember that that deceiver said, while He was yet alive, After three
days I rise again* <span id="fr_1497"></span>[1498](#fn_1497.md) .  His
Passion then was real:  for He was really crucified, and we are not
ashamed thereat; He was crucified, and we deny it not, nay, I rather
glory to speak of it.  For though I should now deny it, here is Golgotha
to confute me, near which we are now assembled; the wood of the Cross
confutes me, which was afterwards distributed piecemeal from hence to
all the world <span id="fr_1498"></span>[1499](#fn_1498.md) .  I confess
the Cross, because I know of the Resurrection; for if, after being
crucified, He had remained as He was, I had not perchance confessed it,
for I might have concealed both it and my Master; but now that the
Resurrection has followed the Cross, I am not ashamed to declare it.

<span id="ii.xvii-p25"></span>5.  Being then in the flesh like others,
He was crucified, but not for the like sins.  For He was not led to
death for covetousness, since He was a Teacher of poverty; nor was He
condemned for concupiscence, for He Himself says plainly, *Whosoever
shall look upon a woman to lust after her, hath committed adultery with
her already* <span id="fr_1499"></span>[1500](#fn_1499.md) ; not for
smiting or striking hastily, for He turned the other cheek also to the
smiter; not for despising the Law, for He was the fulfiller of the Law;
not for reviling a prophet, for it was Himself who was proclaimed by the
Prophets; not for defrauding any of their hire, for He ministered
without reward and freely; not for sinning in words, or deeds, or
thoughts, He *who did no sin, neither was guile found in His mouth; who
when He was reviled, reviled not again; when He suffered, threatened
not* <span id="fr_1500"></span>[1501](#fn_1500.md) ; *who came to His
passion, not unwillingly, but willing; yea, if any dissuading Him say
even now, Be it far from Thee, Lord*, He will say again, *Get thee
behind Me, Satan* <span id="fr_1501"></span>[1502](#fn_1501.md) .

<span id="ii.xvii-p29"></span>6.  And wouldest thou be persuaded that He
came to His passion willingly? others, who foreknow it not, die
unwillingly; but He spoke before of His passion:  *Behold, the Son of
man is betrayed to be crucified* <span
id="fr_1502"></span>[1503](#fn_1502.md) .  But knowest thou wherefore this
Friend of man shunned not death?  It was lest the whole world should
perish in its sins.  *Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man
shall be betrayed, and shall be crucified* <span
id="fr_1503"></span>[1504](#fn_1503.md) *; and again, He stedfastly set His
face to go to Jerusalem* <span id="fr_1504"></span>[1505](#fn_1504.md) . 
And wouldest thou know certainly, that the Cross is a glory to Jesus? 
Hear His own words, not mine.  Judas had become ungrateful to the Master
of the house, and was about to betray Him.  Having but just now gone
forth from the table, and drunk His cup of blessing, in return for that
drought of salvation he sought to shed righteous blood.  *He who did eat
of His bread, was lifting up his heel against Him* <span
id="fr_1505"></span>[1506](#fn_1505.md) ; his hands were but lately
receiving the blessed gifts <span id="fr_1506"></span>[1507](#fn_1506.md) ,
and presently for the wages of betrayal he was plotting His death.  And
being reproved, and having heard that word, *Thou hast said* <span
id="fr_1507"></span>[1508](#fn_1507.md) , he again went out:  then said
Jesus, *The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified* <span
id="fr_1508"></span>[1509](#fn_1508.md) .  Seest thou how He knew the Cross
to be His proper glory?  What then, is Esaias not ashamed of being sawn
asunder <span id="fr_1509"></span>[1510](#fn_1509.md) , and shall Christ be
ashamed of dying for the world?  *Now is the Son of man glorified* <span
id="fr_1510"></span>[1511](#fn_1510.md) .  Not that He was without glory
before:  for He was *glorified with the glory* which was *before the
foundation of the world* <span id="fr_1511"></span>[1512](#fn_1511.md) . 
He was ever glorified as God; but now He was to be glorified in wearing
the Crown of His patience.  He gave not up His life by compulsion, nor
was He put to death by murderous violence, but of His own accord.  Hear
what He says:  *I have power to lay down My life, and I have power to
take it again* <span id="fr_1512"></span>[1513](#fn_1512.md) :  I yield it
of My own choice to My enemies; for unless I chose, this could <span
id="page_84">p. 84</span> <span id="ii.xvii-Page_84"></span>not be.  He
came therefore of His own set purpose to His passion, rejoicing in His
noble deed, smiling at the crown, cheered by the salvation of mankind;
not ashamed of the Cross, for it was to save the world.  For it was no
common man who suffered, but God in man’s nature, striving for the prize
of His patience.

<span id="ii.xvii-p42"></span>7.  But the Jews contradict this <span
id="fr_1513"></span>[1514](#fn_1513.md) , ever ready, as they are, to
cavil, and backward to believe; so that for this cause the Prophet just
now read says, *Lord, who hath believed our report* <span
id="fr_1514"></span>[1515](#fn_1514.md) ?  Persians believe <span
id="fr_1515"></span>[1516](#fn_1515.md) , and Hebrews believe not; *they
shall see, to whom He was not spoken of, and they that have not heard
shall understand* <span id="fr_1516"></span>[1517](#fn_1516.md) , while
they who study these things shall set at nought what they study.  They
speak against us, and say, “Does the Lord then suffer?  What?  Had men’s
hands power over His sovereignty?”  Read the Lamentations; for in those
Lamentations, Jeremias, lamenting you, wrote what is worthy of
lamentations.  He saw your destruction, he beheld your downfall, he
bewailed Jerusalem which then was; for that *which now is* <span
id="fr_1517"></span>[1518](#fn_1517.md) shall not be bewailed; for that
Jerusalem crucified the Christ, but that *which now is* worships Him. 
Lamenting then he says, *The breath of our countenance, Christ the Lord
was taken in our corruptions* <span id="fr_1518"></span>[1519](#fn_1518.md)
.  Am I then stating views of my own?  Behold he testifies of the Lord
Christ seized by men.  And what is to follow from this?  Tell me, O
Prophet.  He says, *Of whom we said, Under His shadow we shall live
among the nations* <span id="fr_1519"></span>[1520](#fn_1519.md) .  For he
signifies that the grace of life is no longer to dwell in Israel, but
among the Gentiles.

<span id="ii.xvii-p50"></span>8.  But since there has been much
gainsaying by them, come, let me, with the help of your prayers, (as the
shortness of the time may allow,) set forth by the grace of the Lord
some few testimonies concerning the Passion.  For the things concerning
Christ are all put into writing, and nothing is doubtful, for nothing is
without a text.  All are inscribed on the monuments of the Prophets;
clearly written, not on tablets of stone, but by the Holy Ghost.  Since
then thou hast heard the Gospel speaking concerning Judas, oughtest thou
not to receive the testimony to it?  Thou hast heard that He was pierced
in the side by a spear; oughtest thou not to see whether this also is
written?  Thou hast heard that He was crucified in a garden; oughtest
thou not to see whether this also is written?  Thou hast heard that He
was sold for thirty pieces of silver; oughtest thou not to learn what
prophet spake this?  Thou hast heard that He was given vinegar to drink;
learn where this also is written.  Thou hast heard that His body was
laid in a rock, and that a stone was set over it; oughtest thou not to
receive this testimony also from the prophet?  Thou hast heard that He
was crucified with robbers; oughtest thou not to see whether this also
is written?  Thou hast heard that He was buried; oughtest thou not to
see whether the circumstances of His burial are anywhere accurately
written?  Thou hast heard that He rose again; oughtest thou not to see
whether we mock thee in teaching these things?  For *our speech and our
preaching is not in persuasive words of man’s wisdom* <span
id="fr_1520"></span>[1521](#fn_1520.md) .  We stir now no sophistical
contrivances; for these become exposed; we do not conquer words with
words <span id="fr_1521"></span>[1522](#fn_1521.md) , for these come to an
end; but *we preach Christ Crucified* <span
id="fr_1522"></span>[1523](#fn_1522.md) , who has already been preached
aforetime by the Prophets.  But do thou, I pray, receive the
testimonies, and seal them in thine heart.  And, since they are many,
and the rest of our time is narrowed into a short space, listen now to a
few of the more important as time permits; and having received these
beginnings, be diligent and seek out the remainder.  Let not thine hand
be only stretched out to receive, but let it be also ready to work <span
id="fr_1523"></span>[1524](#fn_1523.md) .  God gives all things freely. 
*For if any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God who giveth* <span
id="fr_1524"></span>[1525](#fn_1524.md) , and he shall receive.  May He
through your prayer grant utterance to us who speak, and faith to you
who hear.

<span id="ii.xvii-p56"></span>9.  Let us then seek the testimonies to
the Passion of Christ:  for we are met together, not now to make a
speculative exposition of the Scriptures, but rather to be certified of
the things which we already believe.  Now thou hast received from me
first the testimonies concerning the coming of Jesus; and concerning His
walking on the sea, for it is written, *Thy way is in the sea* <span
id="fr_1525"></span>[1526](#fn_1525.md) .  Also concerning divers <span
id="page_85">p. 85</span> <span id="ii.xvii-Page_85"></span>cures thou
hast on another occasion received testimony.  Now therefore I begin from
whence the Passion began.  Judas was the traitor, and he came against
Him, and stood, speaking words of peace, but plotting war.  Concerning
him, therefore, the Psalmist says, *My friends and My neighbours drew
near against Me, and stood* <span id="fr_1526"></span>[1527](#fn_1526.md)
.  And again, *Their words were softer than oil, yet be they
spears* <span id="fr_1527"></span>[1528](#fn_1527.md) .  *Hail,
Master* <span id="fr_1528"></span>[1529](#fn_1528.md) ; yet he was
betraying his Master to death; he was not abashed at His warning, when
He said, *Judas, betrayest than the Son of Man with a kiss* <span
id="fr_1529"></span>[1530](#fn_1529.md) ? for what He said to him was just
this, Recollect thine own name; Judas means *confession* <span
id="fr_1530"></span>[1531](#fn_1530.md) ; thou hast covenanted, thou hast
received the money, make confession quickly.  *O God, pass not over My
praise in silence; for the mouth of the wicked, and the mouth of the
deceitful, are opened against Me; they have spoken against Me with a
treacherous tongue, they have compassed Me about also with words of
hatred* <span id="fr_1531"></span>[1532](#fn_1531.md) .  But that some of
the chief-priests also were present, and that He was put in bonds before
the gates of the city, thou hast heard before, if thou rememberest the
exposition of the Psalm, which has told the time and the place; how
*they returned at evening, and hungered like dogs, and encompassed the
city* <span id="fr_1532"></span>[1533](#fn_1532.md) .

<span id="ii.xvii-p65"></span>10.  Listen also for the thirty pieces of
silver.  *And I will say to them, If it be good in your sight, give me
my price, or refuse* <span id="fr_1533"></span>[1534](#fn_1533.md) , and
the rest.  One price is owing to Me from you for My healing the blind
and lame, and I receive another; for thanksgiving, dishonour, and for
worship, insult.  Seest thou how the Scripture foresaw these things? 
*And they weighed for My price thirty pieces of silver* <span
id="fr_1534"></span>[1535](#fn_1534.md) .  How exact the prophecy! how
great and unerring the wisdom of the Holy Ghost!  For he said, not ten,
nor twenty, but thirty, exactly as many as there were.  Tell also what
becomes of this price, O Prophet!  Does he who received it keep it? or
does he give it back? and after he has given it back, what becomes of
it?  The Prophet says then, *And I took the thirty pieces of silver, and
cast them into the house of the Lord, into the foundry* <span
id="fr_1535"></span>[1536](#fn_1535.md) .  Compare the Gospel with the
Prophecy:  *Judas*, it says, *repented himself, and cast down the pieces
of silver in the temple, and departed* <span
id="fr_1536"></span>[1537](#fn_1536.md) .

<span id="ii.xvii-p70"></span>11.  But now I have to seek the exact
solution of this seeming discrepancy.  For they who make light of the
prophets, allege that the Prophet says on the one hand, *And I cast them
into the house of the Lord, into the foundry*, but the Gospel on the
other hand, *And they gave them for the potter’s field* <span
id="fr_1537"></span>[1538](#fn_1537.md) .  Hear then how they are both
true.  For those conscientious Jews forsooth, the high-priests of that
time, when they saw that Judas repented and said, *I have sinned, in
that I have betrayed innocent blood*, reply, *What is that to us, see
thou to that* <span id="fr_1538"></span>[1539](#fn_1538.md) .  Is it then
nothing to you, the crucifiers? but shall he who received and restored
the price of murder see to it, and shall ye the murderers not see to
it?  Then they say among themselves, *It is not lawful to cast them into
the treasury, because it is the price of blood* <span
id="fr_1539"></span>[1540](#fn_1539.md) .  Out of your own mouths is your
condemnation; if the price is polluted, the deed is polluted also:  but
if thou art fulfilling righteousness in crucifying Christ, why receivest
thou not the price of it?  But the point of iniquity is this:  how is
there no disagreement, if the Gospel says, *the potter’s field*, and the
Prophet, *the foundry*?  Nay, but not only people who are goldsmiths, or
brass-founders, have a foundry, but potters also have foundries for
their clay.  For they sift off the fine and rich and useful earth from
the gravel, and separate from it the mass of the refuse matter, and
temper the clay first with water, that they may work it with ease into
the forms intended.  Why then wonderest thou that the Gospel says
plainly *the potter’s field*, whereas the Prophet spoke his prophecy
like an enigma, since prophecy is in many places enigmatical?

<span id="ii.xvii-p74"></span>12.  They bound Jesus, and brought Him
into the hall of the High-priest.  And wouldest thou learn and know that
this also is written?  Esaias says, *Woe unto their soul, for they have
taken evil counsel against themselves, saying, Let us bind the Just, for
He is troublesome to us* <span id="fr_1540"></span>[1541](#fn_1540.md) . 
And truly, *Woe unto their soul! * Let us see how Esaias was sawn
asunder, yet after this the people was restored.  Jeremias was cast into
the mire of the cistern, yet was the wound of the Jews healed; for the
sin was less, since it was against man.  But when the Jews sinned, not
against man, but against God in man’s nature, *Woe unto their
soul*!—*Let us bind the Just*; could He not then set Himself free, some
one will say; He, who freed Lazarus from the bonds of death on the
fourth day, and loosed Peter <span id="page_86">p. 86</span> <span
id="ii.xvii-Page_86"></span>from the iron bands of a prison?  Angels
stood ready at hand, saying, *Let us burst their bands in sunder* <span
id="fr_1541"></span>[1542](#fn_1541.md) ; but they hold back, because their
Lord willed to undergo it.  Again, He was led to the judgment-seat
before the Elders; thou hast already the testimony to this, *The Lord
Himself will come into judgment with the ancients of His people, and
with the princes thereof* <span id="fr_1542"></span>[1543](#fn_1542.md) .

<span id="ii.xvii-p78"></span>13.  But the High-priest having questioned
Him, and heard the truth, is wroth; and the wicked officer of wicked men
smites Him; and the countenance, which had shone as the sun, endured to
be smitten by lawless hands.  Others also come and spit on the face of
Him, who by spittle had healed the man who was blind from his birth. 
*Do ye thus requite the Lord?  This people is foolish and unwise* <span
id="fr_1543"></span>[1544](#fn_1543.md) .  And the Prophet greatly
wondering, says, *Lord, who hath believed our report* <span
id="fr_1544"></span>[1545](#fn_1544.md) ? for the thing is incredible, that
God, the Son of God, and *the Arm of the Lord* <span
id="fr_1545"></span>[1546](#fn_1545.md) , should suffer such things.  But
that they who are being saved may not disbelieve, the Holy Ghost writes
before, in the person of Christ, who says, (for He who then spake these
things, was afterward Himself an actor in them,) *I gave My back to the
scourges*; (for Pilate, *when he had scourged Him, delivered Him to be
crucified* <span id="fr_1546"></span>[1547](#fn_1546) ;.md) *and My cheeks
to smitings; and My face I turned not away from the shame of spittings;*
saying, as it were, “Though knowing before that they will smite Me, I
did not even turn My cheek aside; for how should I have nerved My
disciples against death for truth’s sake, had I Myself dreaded this?”  I
said. *He that loveth his life shall lose it* <span
id="fr_1547"></span>[1548](#fn_1547.md) :  if I had loved My life, how was
I to teach without practising what I taught?  First then, being Himself
God, He endured to suffer these things at the hands of men; that after
this, we men, when we suffer such things at the hands of men for His
sake, might not be ashamed.  Thou seest that of these things also the
prophets have clearly written beforehand.  Many, however, of the
Scripture testimonies I pass by for want of time, as I said before; for
if one should exactly search out all, not one of the things concerning
Christ would be left without witness.

<span id="ii.xvii-p84"></span>14.  Having been bound, He came from
Caiaphas to Pilate,—is this too written? yes; *And having bound Him,
they led Him away as a present to the king of Jarim* <span
id="fr_1548"></span>[1549](#fn_1548.md) .  But here some sharp hearer will
object, “Pilate was not a king,” (to leave for a while the main parts of
the question,) “how then having bound Him, led they Him as a present to
the king?”  But read thou the Gospel; *When Pilate heard that He was of
Galilee, he sent Him to Herod* <span
id="fr_1549"></span>[1550](#fn_1549.md) ; for Herod was then king, and was
present at Jerusalem.  And now observe the exactness of the Prophet; for
he says, that He was sent as a present; for *the same day Pilate and
Herod were made friends together, for before they were at enmity* <span
id="fr_1550"></span>[1551](#fn_1550.md) .  For it became Him who was on the
eve of making peace between earth and heaven, to make the very men who
condemned Him the first to be at peace; for the Lord Himself was there
present, *who reconciles* <span id="fr_1551"></span>[1552](#fn_1551.md)
*the hearts of the princes of the earth*.  Mark the exactness of the
Prophets, and their true testimony.

<span id="ii.xvii-p89"></span>15.  Look with awe then at the Lord who
was judged.  He suffered Himself to be led and carried by soldiers. 
Pilate sat in judgment, and He who sitteth on the right hand of the
Father, stood and was judged <span id="fr_1552"></span>[1553](#fn_1552.md)
.  The people whom He had redeemed from the land of Egypt, and oftimes
from other places, shouted against Him, *Away with Him, away with Him,
crucify Him* <span id="fr_1553"></span>[1554](#fn_1553.md) .  Wherefore, O
ye Jews? because He healed your blind? or because He made your lame to
walk, and bestowed His other benefits?  So that the Prophet in amazement
speaks of this too, *Against whom have ye opened your mouth, and against
whom have ye let loose your tongue* <span
id="fr_1554"></span>[1555](#fn_1554.md) ? and the Lord Himself says in the
Prophets, *Mine heritage became unto Me as a lion in the forest; it gave
its voice against Me; therefore have I hated it* <span
id="fr_1555"></span>[1556](#fn_1555.md) .  I have not refused them, but
they have refused Me; in consequence thereof I say, *I have forsaken My
house* <span id="fr_1556"></span>[1557](#fn_1556.md) .

<span id="ii.xvii-p95"></span>16.  When He was judged, He held His
peace; so that Pilate was moved for Him, and said, *Hearest Thou not
what these witness against Thee* <span
id="fr_1557"></span>[1558](#fn_1557.md) ?  Not that He knew Him who was
judged, but he feared his own wife’s dream which had been reported to
him.  And Jesus held His peace.  The Psalmist says, *And I became as a
man that heareth not; and in whose mouth are no reproofs* <span
id="fr_1558"></span>[1559](#fn_1558.md) ; and again, *But I was as a deaf
man and heard not; and as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth* <span
id="fr_1559"></span>[1560](#fn_1559.md) .  Thou <span id="page_87">p.
87</span> <span id="ii.xvii-Page_87"></span>hast before heard concerning
this <span id="fr_1560"></span>[1561](#fn_1560.md) , if thou rememberest.

<span id="ii.xvii-p100"></span>17.  But the soldiers who crowd around
mock Him, and their Lord becomes a sport to them, and upon their Master
they make jests.  *When they looked on Me, they shaked their
heads* <span id="fr_1561"></span>[1562](#fn_1561.md) .  Yet the figure of
kingly state appears; for though in mockery, yet they bend the knee. 
And the soldiers before they crucify Him, put on Him a purple robe, and
set a crown on His head; for what though it be of thorns?  Every king is
proclaimed by soldiers; and Jesus also must in a figure be crowned by
soldiers; so that for this cause the Scripture says in the Canticles,
*Go forth, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, and look upon King Solomon in
the crown wherewith His mother crowned Him* <span
id="fr_1562"></span>[1563](#fn_1562.md) .  And the crown itself was a
mystery; for it was a remission of sins, a release from the curse.

<span id="ii.xvii-p103"></span>18.  Adam received the sentence, *Cursed
is the ground in thy labours; thorns and thistles shall it bring forth
to thee* <span id="fr_1563"></span>[1564](#fn_1563.md) .  For this cause
Jesus assumes the thorns, that He may cancel the sentence; for this
cause also was He buried in the earth, that the earth which had been
cursed might receive the blessing instead of a curse.  At the time of
the sin, they clothed themselves with fig-leaves; for this cause Jesus
also made the fig-tree the last of His signs.  For when about to go to
His passion, He curses the fig-tree, not every fig-tree, but that one
alone, for the sake of the figure; saying, *No more let any man eat
fruit of thee* <span id="fr_1564"></span>[1565](#fn_1564.md) ; let the doom
be cancelled.  And because they aforetime clothed themselves with
fig-leaves, He came at a season when food was not wont to be found on
the fig-tree.  Who knows not that in winter-time the fig-tree bears no
fruit, but is clothed with leaves only?  Was Jesus ignorant of this,
which all knew?  No, but though He knew, yet He came as if seeking; not
ignorant that He should not find, but shewing that the emblematical
curse extended to the leaves only.

<span id="ii.xvii-p106"></span>19.  And since we have touched on things
connected with Paradise, I am truly astonished at the truth of the
types.  In Paradise was the Fall, and in a Garden was our Salvation. 
From the Tree came sin, and until the Tree sin lasted.  *In the evening,
when the Lord walked in the Garden, they hid themselves* <span
id="fr_1565"></span>[1566](#fn_1565.md) ; and in the evening the robber is
brought by the Lord into Paradise.  But some one will say to me, “Thou
art inventing subtleties; shew me from some prophet the Wood of the
Cross; except thou give me a testimony from a prophet, I will not be
persuaded.  Hear then from Jeremias, and assure thyself; *I was like a
harmless lamb led to be slaughtered; did I not know it* <span
id="fr_1566"></span>[1567](#fn_1566.md) ? (for in this manner read it as a
question, as I have read it; for He who said, *Ye know that after two
days comes the passover, and the Son of Man is betrayed to be
crucified* <span id="fr_1567"></span>[1568](#fn_1567.md) , did He not
know?) *I was like a harmless lamb led to be slaughtered; did I not know
it?* (but what sort of lamb? let John the Baptist interpret it, when he
says, Behold the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sin of the
world <span id="fr_1568"></span>[1569](#fn_1568) ..md)  *They devised
against Me a wicked device, saying* <span
id="fr_1569"></span>[1570](#fn_1569.md) —(He who knows the devices, knew He
not the result of them?  And what said they?)—*Come, and let us place a
beam upon His bread* <span id="fr_1570"></span>[1571](#fn_1570.md) —(and if
the Lord reckon thee worthy, thou shalt hereafter learn, that His body
according to the Gospel bore the figure of bread;)—*Come* then, *and let
us place a beam upon His bread, and cut Him off out of the land of the
living;*—(life is not cut off, why labour ye for nought?)—*And His name
shall be remembered no more.*  Vain is your counsel; for *before the sun
His Name* <span id="fr_1571"></span>[1572](#fn_1571.md) abideth in the
Church.  And that it was Life, which hung on the Cross, Moses says,
weeping, *And thy life shall be hanging before thine eyes; and thou
shalt be afraid day and night, and thou shalt not trust thy life* <span
id="fr_1572"></span>[1573](#fn_1572.md) .  And so too, what was just now
read as the text, *Lord, who hath believed our report?*

<span id="ii.xvii-p115"></span>20.  This was the figure which Moses
completed by fixing the serpent to a cross, that whoso had been bitten
by the living serpent, and looked to the brasen serpent, might be saved
by believing <span id="fr_1573"></span>[1574](#fn_1573.md) .  Does then the
brazen serpent save when crucified, and shall not the Son of God
incarnate save when crucified also?  On each occasion life comes by
means of wood.  For in the time <span id="page_88">p. 88</span> <span
id="ii.xvii-Page_88"></span>of Noe the preservation of life was by an
ark of wood.  In the time of Moses the sea, on beholding the
emblematical rod, was abashed at him who smote it; is then Moses’ rod
mighty, and is the Cross of the Saviour powerless?  But I pass by the
greater part of the types, to keep within measure.  The wood in Moses’
case sweetened the water; and from the side of Jesus the water flowed
upon the wood.

<span id="ii.xvii-p117"></span>21.  The beginning of signs under Moses
was blood and water; and the last of all Jesus’ signs was the same. 
First, Moses changed the river into blood; and Jesus at the last gave
forth from His side water with blood.  This was perhaps on account of
the two speeches, his who judged Him, and theirs who cried out against
Him; or because of the believers and the unbelievers.  For Pilate said,
*I am innocent* and washed his hands in water; they who cried out
against Him said, *His blood be upon us* <span
id="fr_1574"></span>[1575](#fn_1574.md) :  there came therefore these two
out of His side; the water, perhaps, for him who judged Him; but for
them that shouted against Him the blood.  And again it is to be
understood in another way; the blood for the Jews, and the water for the
Christians:  for upon them as plotters came the condemnation from the
blood; but to thee who now believest, the salvation which is by water. 
For nothing has been done without a meaning.  Our fathers who have
written comments have given another reason of this matter.  For since in
the Gospels the power of salutary Baptism is twofold, one which is
granted by means of water to the illuminated, and a second to holy
martyrs, in persecutions, through their own blood, there came out of
that saving Side blood and water <span
id="fr_1575"></span>[1576](#fn_1575.md) , to confirm the grace of the
confession made for Christ, whether in baptism, or on occasions of
martyrdom.  There is another reason also for mentioning the Side.  The
woman, who was formed from the side, led the way to sin; but Jesus who
came to bestow the grace of pardon on men and women alike, was pierced
in the side for women, that He might undo the sin.

<span id="ii.xvii-p120"></span>22.  And whoever will inquire, will find
other reasons also; but what has been said is enough, because of the
shortness of the time, and that the attention of my hearers may not
become sated.  And yet we never can be tired of hearing concerning the
crowning of our Lord, and least of all in this most holy Golgotha.  For
others only hear, but we both see and handle.  Let none be weary; take
thine armour against the adversaries in the cause of the Cross itself;
set up the faith of the Cross as a trophy against the gainsayers.  For
when thou art going to dispute with unbelievers concerning the Cross of
Christ, first make with thy hand the sign of Christ’s Cross, and the
gainsayer will be silenced.  Be not ashamed to confess the Cross; for
Angels glory in it, saying, *We know whom ye seek, Jesus the
Crucified* <span id="fr_1576"></span>[1577](#fn_1576.md) .  Mightest thou
not say, O Angel, “I know whom ye seek, my Master?”  But, “I,” he says
with boldness, “I know the Crucified.”  For the Cross is a Crown, not a
dishonour.

<span id="ii.xvii-p122"></span>23.  Now let us recur to the proof out of
the Prophets which I spoke of.  The Lord was crucified; thou hast
received the testimonies.  Thou seest this spot of Golgotha!  Thou
answerest with a shout of praise, as if assenting.  See that thou recant
not in time of persecution.  Rejoice not in the Cross in time of peace
only, but hold fast the same faith in time of persecution also; be not
in time of peace a friend of Jesus, and His foe in time of wars.  Thou
receivest now remission of thy sins, and the gifts of the King’s
spiritual bounty; when war shall come, strive thou nobly for thy King. 
Jesus, the Sinless, was crucified for thee; and wilt not thou be
crucified for Him who was crucified for thee?  Thou art not bestowing a
favour, for thou hast first received; but thou art returning a favour,
repaying thy debt to Him who was crucified for thee in Golgotha.  Now
Golgotha is interpreted, “the place of a skull.”  Who were they then,
who prophetically named this spot Golgotha, in which Christ the true
Head endured the Cross?  As the Apostle says, *Who is the Image of the
Invisible God;* and a little after, *and He is the Head of the body, the
Church* <span id="fr_1577"></span>[1578](#fn_1577.md) .  And again, *The
Head of every man is Christ* <span id="fr_1578"></span>[1579](#fn_1578.md)
; and again, *Who is the Head of all principality and power* <span
id="fr_1579"></span>[1580](#fn_1579.md) .  The Head suffered in “the place
of the skull.”  O wondrous prophetic appellation!  The very name also
reminds thee, saying, “Think not of the Crucified as of a mere man; He
is *the Head of all principality and power*.  That Head which was
crucified is the Head of all power, and has for His Head the Father;
*for the Head of the man is Christ, and the Head of Christ is God* <span
id="fr_1580"></span>[1581](#fn_1580.md) .”

<span id="ii.xvii-p127"></span>24.  Christ then was crucified for us,
who was judged in the night, when it was cold, and therefore a *fire of
coals* <span id="fr_1581"></span>[1582](#fn_1581.md) was laid.  He was
crucified at the third hour; *and from the sixth* <span id="page_89">p.
89</span> <span id="ii.xvii-Page_89"></span>*hour there was darkness
until the ninth hour* <span id="fr_1582"></span>[1583](#fn_1582.md) ; but
from the ninth hour there was light again.  Are these things also
written?  Let us inquire.  Now the Prophet Zacharias says, *And it shall
come to pass in that day, that there shall not be light, and there shall
be cold and frost one day;* (the cold on account of which Peter warmed
himself;) *And that day shall be known unto the Lord* <span
id="fr_1583"></span>[1584](#fn_1583.md) ; (what, knew He not the other
days? days are many, but *this is the day* of the Lord’s patience,
*which the Lord made* <span id="fr_1584"></span>[1585](#fn_1584) ;.md)—*And
that day shall be known unto the Lord, not day, and not night: * what is
this dark saying which the Prophet speaks?  That day is neither day nor
night? what then shall we name it?  The Gospel interprets it, by
relating the event.  It was not day; for the sun shone not uniformly
from his rising to his setting, but from the sixth hour till the ninth
hour, there was darkness at mid-day.  The darkness therefore was
interposed; but *God called the darkness night* <span
id="fr_1585"></span>[1586](#fn_1585.md) .  Wherefore it was neither day nor
night:  for neither was it all light, that it should be called day; nor
was it all darkness, that it should be called night; but after the ninth
hour the sun shone forth.  This also the Prophet foretels; for after
saying, *Not day, nor night,* he added, *And at evening time it shall be
light* <span id="fr_1586"></span>[1587](#fn_1586.md) .  Seest thou the
exactness of the prophets?  Seest thou the truth of the things which
were written aforetime?

<span id="ii.xvii-p134"></span>25.  But dost thou ask exactly at what
hour the sun failed <span id="fr_1587"></span>[1588](#fn_1587.md) ? was it
the fifth hour, or the eighth, or the tenth?  Tell, O Prophet, the exact
time thereof to the Jews, who are unwilling to hear; when shall the sun
go down?  The Prophet Amos answers, *And it shall come to pass in that
day, saith the Lord God, that the sun shall go down at noon* (for there
was darkness from the sixth hour;) *and the light shall grow dark over
the earth in the day* <span id="fr_1588"></span>[1589](#fn_1588.md) .” 
What sort of season is this, O Prophet, and what sort of day?  *And I
will turn your feasts into mourning*; for this was done in the days of
unleavened bread, and at the feast of the Passover:  then afterwards he
says, *And I will make Him as the mourning of an Only Son, and those
with Him as a day of anguish* <span id="fr_1589"></span>[1590](#fn_1589.md)
; for in the day of unleavened bread, and at the feast, their women were
wailing and weeping, and the Apostles had hidden themselves and were in
anguish.  Wonderful then is this prophecy.

<span id="ii.xvii-p138"></span>26.  But, some one will say, “Give me yet
another sign; what other exact sign is there of that which has come to
pass?  Jesus was crucified; and He wore but one coat, and one cloak: 
now His cloak the soldiers shared among themselves, having rent it into
four; but His coat was not rent, for when rent it would have been no
longer of any use; so about this lots are cast by the soldiers; thus the
one they divide, but for the other they cast lots.  Is then this also
written?  They know, the diligent chanters <span
id="fr_1590"></span>[1591](#fn_1590.md) of the Church, who imitate the
Angel hosts, and continually sing praises to God:  who are thought
worthy to chant Psalms in this Golgotha, and to say, *They parted My
garments among them, and upon My vesture they did cast lots* <span
id="fr_1591"></span>[1592](#fn_1591.md) .  The “lots” were what the
soldiers cast <span id="fr_1592"></span>[1593](#fn_1592.md) .

<span id="ii.xvii-p142"></span>27.  Again, when He had been judged
before Pilate, He was clothed in red; for there they put on Him a purple
robe.  Is this also written?  Esaias saith, *Who is this that cometh
from Edom? the redness of His garments is from Bosor* <span
id="fr_1593"></span>[1594](#fn_1593.md) ; (who is this who in dishonor
weareth purple?  For Bosor has some such meaning in Hebrew <span
id="fr_1594"></span>[1595](#fn_1594) ..md)  *Why are Thy garments red, and
Thy raiment as from a trodden wine-press? * But He answers and says,
*All day long have I stretched forth Mine hands unto a disobedient and
gainsaying people* <span id="fr_1595"></span>[1596](#fn_1595.md) .

<span id="ii.xvii-p146"></span>28.  He stretched out His hands on the
Cross, that He might embrace the ends of the world; for this Golgotha is
the very centre of the earth.  It is not my word, but it is a prophet
who hath said, *Thou hast wrought salvation in the midst of the
earth* <span id="fr_1596"></span>[1597](#fn_1596.md) .  He stretched forth
human hands, who by His spiritual hands had established the heaven; and
they were fastened with nails, that His manhood, which here the sins of
men, having been nailed to the tree, and having died, sin might die with
it, and we might rise again in righteousness.  *For since by one man
came death, by* One *Man came also life* <span
id="fr_1597"></span>[1598](#fn_1597.md) ; by One Man, the Saviour, dying of
His own accord:  for remember what He said, *I have power to* <span
id="page_90">p. 90</span> <span id="ii.xvii-Page_90"></span>*lay down My
life, and I have power to take it again* <span
id="fr_1598"></span>[1599](#fn_1598.md) .

<span id="ii.xvii-p150"></span>29.  But though He endured these things,
having come for the salvation of all, yet the people returned Him an
evil recompense.  Jesus saith, *I thirst* <span
id="fr_1599"></span>[1600](#fn_1599.md) ,—He who had brought forth the
waters for them out of the craggy rock; and He asked fruit of the Vine
which He had planted.  But what does the Vine?  This Vine, which was by
nature of the holy fathers, but of Sodom by purpose of heart;—(for
*their Vine is of Sodom, and their tendrils of Gomorrah* <span
id="fr_1600"></span>[1601](#fn_1600) ;.md)—this Vine, when the Lord was
athirst, having filled a sponge and put it on a reed, offers Him
vinegar.  *They gave Me also gall for My meat, and in My thirst, they
gave Me vinegar to drink* <span id="fr_1601"></span>[1602](#fn_1601.md) . 
Thou seest the clearness of the Prophets’ description.  But what sort of
gall put they into My mouth?  *They gave Him,* it says, *wine mingled
with myrrh* <span id="fr_1602"></span>[1603](#fn_1602.md) .  Now myrrh is
in taste like gall, and very bitter.  Are these things what ye
recompense unto the Lord?  Are these thy offerings, O Vine, unto thy
Master?  Rightly did the Prophet Esaias aforetime bewail you, saying,
*My well-beloved had a vineyard in a hill in a fruitful place;* and (not
to recite the whole) *I waited*, he says, *that it should bring forth
grapes*; I thirsted that it should give wine; *but it brought forth
thorns* <span id="fr_1603"></span>[1604](#fn_1603.md) ; for thou seest the
crown, wherewith I am adorned.  What then shall I now decree?  I will
command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it <span
id="fr_1604"></span>[1605](#fn_1604.md) .  For the clouds which are the
Prophets were removed from them, and are for the future in the Church;
as Paul says, *Let the Prophets speak two or three, and let the others
judge* <span id="fr_1605"></span>[1606](#fn_1605.md) ; and again, *God gave
in the Church, some, Apostles, and some, Prophets* <span
id="fr_1606"></span>[1607](#fn_1606.md) .  Agabus, who bound his own feet
and hands, was a prophet.

<span id="ii.xvii-p159"></span>30.  Concerning the robbers who were
crucified with Him, it is written, *And He was numbered with the
transgressors* <span id="fr_1607"></span>[1608](#fn_1607.md) .  Both of
them were before this transgressors, but one was so no longer.  For the
one was a transgressor to the end, stubborn against salvation; who,
though his hands were fastened, smote with blasphemy by his tongue. 
When the Jews passing by wagged their heads, mocking the Crucified, and
fulfilling what was written, *When they looked on Me, they shaked their
heads* <span id="fr_1608"></span>[1609](#fn_1608.md) , he also reviled with
them.  But the other rebused the reviler; and it was to him the end of
life and the beginning of restoration; the surrender of his soul a first
share in salvation.  And after rebuking the other, he says, *Lord,
remember me* <span id="fr_1609"></span>[1610](#fn_1609.md) ; for with Thee
is my account.  Heed not this man, for the eyes of his understanding are
blinded; but remember me.  I say not, remember my works, for of these I
am afraid.  Every man has a feeling for his fellow-traveller; I am
travelling with Thee towards death; remember me, Thy fellow-wayfarer.  I
say not, Remember me now, but, *when Thou comest in Thy kingdom*.

<span id="ii.xvii-p163"></span>31.  What power, O robber, led thee to
the light?  Who taught thee to worship that despised Man, thy companion
on the Cross?  O Light Eternal, which gives light to them that are in
darkness!  Therefore also he justly heard the words, *Be of good
cheer* <span id="fr_1610"></span>[1611](#fn_1610.md) ; not that thy deeds
are worthy of good cheer; but that the King is here, dispensing
favours.  The request reached unto a distant time; but the grace was
very speedy.  *Verily I say unto thee, This day shalt thou be with Me in
Paradise;* because *to-day* thou hast *heard My voice,* and hast not
*hardened thine heart* <span id="fr_1611"></span>[1612](#fn_1611.md) . 
Very speedily I passed sentence upon Adam, very speedily I pardon thee. 
To him it was said, *In the day wherein ye eat, ye shall surely
die* <span id="fr_1612"></span>[1613](#fn_1612.md) ; but thou to-day hast
obeyed the faith, to-day is thy salvation.  Adam by the Tree fell away;
thou by the Tree art brought into Paradise.  Fear not the serpent; he
shall not cast thee out; for he is *fallen from heaven* <span
id="fr_1613"></span>[1614](#fn_1613.md) .  And I say not unto thee, This
day shalt thou depart, but, *This day shalt thou be with Me*.  Be of
good courage:  thou shalt not be cast out.  Fear not the flaming sword;
it shrinks from its Lord <span id="fr_1614"></span>[1615](#fn_1614.md) .  O
mighty and ineffable grace!  The faithful Abraham had not yet entered,
but the robber enters <span id="fr_1615"></span>[1616](#fn_1615.md) ! 
Moses and the Prophets had not yet entered, and the robber enters though
a breaker of the law.  Paul also wondered at this before thee, saying,
*Where sin abounded, there grace did much more abound* <span
id="fr_1616"></span>[1617](#fn_1616.md) .  They who had borne the heat of
the day had not yet entered; and he of the eleventh hour entered.  Let
none murmur against the goodman of the house, for he says, *Friend, I do
thee no wrong; is it not* <span id="page_91">p. 91</span> <span
id="ii.xvii-Page_91"></span>*lawful for Me to do what I will with Mine
own* <span id="fr_1617"></span>[1618](#fn_1617.md) ?  The robber has a will
to work righteousness, but death prevents him; I wait not exclusively
for the work, but faith also I accept.  I am come who *feed My sheep
among the lilies* <span id="fr_1618"></span>[1619](#fn_1618.md) , I am come
to feed them in the gardens.  I have *found* a *sheep that was
lost* <span id="fr_1619"></span>[1620](#fn_1619.md) , but I lay it on My
shoulders; for he believes, since he himself has said, *I have gone
astray like a lost sheep* <span id="fr_1620"></span>[1621](#fn_1620.md) ;
*Lord, remember me when Thou comest in Thy kingdom.*

<span id="ii.xvii-p175"></span>32.  Of this garden I sang of old to My
spouse in the Canticles, and spoke to her thus.  *I am come into My
garden, My sister, My spouse* <span id="fr_1621"></span>[1622](#fn_1621.md)
; (*now in the place where He was crucified was a garden* <span
id="fr_1622"></span>[1623](#fn_1622) ;.md) and what takest Thou thence?  *I
have gathered My myrrh;* having drunk wine mingled with myrrh, and
vinegar, after receiving which, He said, It is finished <span
id="fr_1623"></span>[1624](#fn_1623.md) .  For the mystery has been
fulfilled; the things that are written have been accomplished; sins are
forgiven.  For *Christ being come an High-Priest of the good things to
come, by the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands,
that is to say, not of this creation, nor yet by the blood of goats and
calves, but by His own blood, entered in once for all into the holy
place, having obtained eternal redemption; for if the blood of bulls and
of goats, and the ashes of an heifer, sprinkling the defiled,
sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh, how much more the blood of
Christ* <span id="fr_1624"></span>[1625](#fn_1624.md) ?  And again, *Having
therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of
Jesus, by a new and living way, which He hath consecrated for us,
through the veil, that is to say, His flesh* <span
id="fr_1625"></span>[1626](#fn_1625.md) .  And because His flesh, this
veil, was dishonoured, therefore the typical veil of the temple was rent
asunder, as it is written, *And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent
in twain from the top to the bottom* <span
id="fr_1626"></span>[1627](#fn_1626.md) ; for not a particle of it was
left; for since the Master said, *Behold, your house is left unto you
desolate* <span id="fr_1627"></span>[1628](#fn_1627.md) , the house brake
all in pieces.

<span id="ii.xvii-p183"></span>33.  These things the Saviour endured,
*and made peace through the Blood of His Cross, for things in heaven,
and things in earth* <span id="fr_1628"></span>[1629](#fn_1628.md) .  For
we were enemies of God through sin, and God had appointed the sinner to
die.  There must needs therefore have happened one of two things; either
that God, in His truth, should destroy all men, or that in His
loving-kindness He should cancel the sentence.  But behold the wisdom of
God; He preserved both the truth of His sentence, and the exercise of
His loving-kindness.  Christ took our sins in *His body on the tree,
that we by His death might die to sin, and live unto
righteousness* <span id="fr_1629"></span>[1630](#fn_1629.md) .  Of no small
account was He who died for us; He was not a literal sheep; He was not a
mere man; He was more than an Angel; He was God made man.  The
transgression of sinners was not so great as the righteousness of Him
who died for them; the sin which we committed was not so great as the
righteousness which He wrought who laid down His life for us,—who laid
it down when He pleased, and took it again when He pleased.  And
wouldest thou know that He laid not down His life by violence, nor
yielded up the ghost against His will?  He cried to the Father, saying,
*Father, into Thy hands I commend My spirit* <span
id="fr_1630"></span>[1631](#fn_1630.md) ; I commend it, that I may take it
again.  And having said these things, *He gave up the ghost* <span
id="fr_1631"></span>[1632](#fn_1631.md) ; but not for any long time, for He
quickly rose again from the dead.

<span id="ii.xvii-p188"></span>34.  The Sun was darkened, because of
*the Sun of Righteousness* <span id="fr_1632"></span>[1633](#fn_1632.md) . 
Rocks were rent, because of the spiritual Rock.  Tombs were opened, and
the dead arose, because of Him who was *free among the dead* <span
id="fr_1633"></span>[1634](#fn_1633.md) ; *He sent forth His prisoners out
of the pit wherein is no water* <span
id="fr_1634"></span>[1635](#fn_1634.md) .  Be not then ashamed of the
Crucified, but be thou also bold to say, *He beareth our sins, and
endureth grief for us, and with His stripes we are healed* <span
id="fr_1635"></span>[1636](#fn_1635.md) .  Let us not be unthankful to our
Benefactor.  And again; *for the transgression of my people was He led
to death; and I will give the wicked for His burial, and the rich for
His death* <span id="fr_1636"></span>[1637](#fn_1636.md) .  Therefore Paul
says plainly, *that Christ died for our sins according to the
Scriptures, and that He was buried, and that He hath risen again the
third day according to the Scriptures* <span
id="fr_1637"></span>[1638](#fn_1637.md) .

<span id="ii.xvii-p195"></span>35.  But we seek to know clearly where He
has been buried.  Is His tomb made with hands?  Is it, like the tombs of
kings, raised above the ground?  Is the Sepulchre made of stones joined
together?  And what is laid upon it?  Tell us, O Prophets, the exact
truth concerning His tomb also, where He is laid, and where we shall
seek Him?  And they say, *Look into the solid rock which ye have
hewn* <span id="fr_1638"></span>[1639](#fn_1638.md) .  *Look in* and
behold.  Thou hast in the Gospels *In a sepulchre hewn in stone, which
was hewn out of a rock* <span id="fr_1639"></span>[1640](#fn_1639.md) . 
And what happens next?  What kind of door has the sepulchre?  Again
another Prophet says, *They cut off My life in a dungeon* <span
id="fr_1640"></span>[1641](#fn_1640.md) , *and cast a stone upon Me.*  I,
who am the *Chief corner-stone, the elect, the precious* <span
id="fr_1641"></span>[1642](#fn_1641.md) , lie for a little time within a
stone—I who am a stone of stumbling to the Jews, and of salvation to
<span id="page_92">p. 92</span> <span id="ii.xvii-Page_92"></span>them
who believe.  *The Tree of life* <span
id="fr_1642"></span>[1643](#fn_1642.md) , therefore was planted in the
earth, that the earth which had been cursed might enjoy the blessing,
and that the dead might be released.

<span id="ii.xvii-p201"></span>36.  Let us not then be ashamed to
confess the Crucified.  Be the Cross our seal made with boldness by our
fingers on our brow, and on everything; over the bread we eat, and the
cups we drink; in our comings in, and goings out; before our sleep, when
we lie down and when we rise up; when we are in the way, and when we are
still <span id="fr_1643"></span>[1644](#fn_1643.md) .  Great is that
preservative; it is without price, for the sake of the poor; without
toil, for the sick; since also its grace is from God.  It is the Sign of
the faithful, and the dread of devils:  for He *triumphed over them in
it, having made a shew of them openly* <span
id="fr_1644"></span>[1645](#fn_1644.md) ; for when they see the Cross they
are reminded of the Crucified; they are afraid of Him, who *bruised the
heads of the dragon* <span id="fr_1645"></span>[1646](#fn_1645.md) . 
Despise not the Seal, because of the freeness of the gift; out for this
the rather honour thy Benefactor.

<span id="ii.xvii-p205"></span>37.  And if thou ever fall into
disputation and hast not the grounds of proof, yet let Faith remain firm
in thee; or rather, become thou well learned, and then silence the Jews
out of the prophets, and the Greeks out of their own fables.  They
themselves worship men who have been thunderstricken <span
id="fr_1646"></span>[1647](#fn_1646.md) :  but the thunder when it comes
from heaven, comes not at random.  If they are not ashamed to worship
men thunderstricken and abhorred of God, art thou ashamed to worship the
beloved Son of God, who was crucified for thee?  I am ashamed to tell
the tales about their so-called Gods, and I leave them because of time;
let those who know, speak.  And let all heretics also be silenced.  If
any say that the Cross is an illusion, turn away from him.  Abhor those
who say that Christ was crucified to our fancy <span
id="fr_1647"></span>[1648](#fn_1647.md) only; for if so, and if salvation
is from the Cross, then is salvation a fancy also.  If the Cross is
fancy, the Resurrection is fancy also; but *if Christ be not risen, we
are yet in our sins* <span id="fr_1648"></span>[1649](#fn_1648.md) .  If
the Cross is fancy, the Ascension also is fancy; and if the Ascension is
fancy, then is the second coming also fancy, and everything is
henceforth unsubstantial.

<span id="ii.xvii-p209"></span>38.  Take therefore first, as an
indestructible foundation, the Cross, and build upon it the other
articles of the faith.  Deny not the Crucified; for, if thou deny Him,
thou hast many to arraign thee.  Judas the traitor will arraign thee
first; for he who betrayed Him knows that He was condemned to death by
the chief-priests and elders.  The thirty pieces of silver bear witness;
Gethsemane bears witness, where the betrayal occurred; I speak not yet
of the Mount of Olives, on which they were with Him at night, praying. 
The moon in the night bears witness; the day bears witness, and the sun
which was darkened; for it endured not to look on the crime of the
conspirators.  The fire will arraign thee, by which Peter stood and
warmed himself; if thou deny the Cross, the eternal fire awaits thee.  I
speak hard words, that thou may not experience hard pains.  Remember the
swords that came against Him in Gethsemane, that thou feel not the
eternal sword.  The house of Caiaphas <span
id="fr_1649"></span>[1650](#fn_1649.md) will arraign thee, shewing by its
present desolation the power of Him who was erewhile judged there.  Yea,
Caiaphas himself will rise up against thee in the day of judgment, the
very servant will rise up against thee, who smote Jesus with the palm of
his hand; they also who bound Him, and they who led Him away.  Even
Herod shall rise up against thee; and Pilate; as if saying, Why deniest
thou Him who was slandered before us by the Jews, and whom we knew to
have done no wrong?  For I Pilate then washed my hands.  The false
witnesses shall rise up against thee, and the soldiers who arrayed Him
in the purple robe, and set on Him the crown of thorns, and crucified
Him in Golgotha, and cast lots for His coat.  Simon the Cyrenian will
cry out upon thee, who bore the Cross after Jesus.

<span id="ii.xvii-p216"></span>39.  From among the stars there will cry
out upon thee, the darkened Sun; among the things upon earth, the Wine
mingled with myrrh; among reeds, the Reed; among herbs, the Hyssop;
among the things of the sea, the Sponge; among trees, the Wood of the
Cross;—the soldiers, too, as I have said, who nailed Him, and cast lots
for His vesture; the soldier who pierced His side with the spear; the
women who then were present; the veil of the <span id="page_93">p.
93</span> <span id="ii.xvii-Page_93"></span>temple then rent asunder;
the hall of Pilate, now laid waste by the power of Him who was then
crucified; this holy Golgotha, which stands high above us, and shews
itself to this day, and displays even yet how because of Christ the
rocks were then riven <span id="fr_1650"></span>[1651](#fn_1650.md) ; the
sepulchre nigh at hand where He was laid; and the stone which was laid
on the door, which lies to this day by the tomb; the Angels who were
then present; the women who worshipped Him after His resurrection; Peter
and John, who ran to the sepulchre; and Thomas, who thrust his hand into
His side, and his fingers into the prints of the nails.  For it was for
our sakes that he so carefully handled Him; and what thou, who wert not
there present, wouldest have sought, he being present, by God’s
Providence, did seek.

<span id="ii.xvii-p218"></span>40.  Thou hast Twelve Apostles, witnesses
of the Cross; and the whole earth, and the world of men who believe on
Him who hung thereon.  Let thy very presence here now persuade thee of
the power of the Crucified.  For who now brought thee to this assembly?
what soldiers?  With what bonds wast thou constrained?  What sentence
held thee fast here now?  Nay, it was the Trophy of salvation, the Cross
of Jesus that brought you all together.  It was this that enslaved the
Persians, and tamed the Scythians; this that gave to the Egyptians, for
cats and dogs and their manifold errors, the knowledge of God; this,
that to this day heals diseases; that to this day drives away devils,
and overthrows the juggleries of drugs and charms.

<span id="ii.xvii-p219"></span>41.  This shall appear again with Jesus
from heaven <span id="fr_1651"></span>[1652](#fn_1651.md) ; for the trophy
shall precede the king:  that seeing *Him whom they pierced* <span
id="fr_1652"></span>[1653](#fn_1652.md) , and knowing by the Cross Him who
was dishonoured, the Jews may repent and mourn; (but *they shall mourn
tribe by tribe* <span id="fr_1653"></span>[1654](#fn_1653.md) , for they
shall repent, when there shall be no more time for repentance;) and that
we may glory, exulting in the Cross, worshipping the Lord who was sent,
and crucified for us, and worshipping also God His Father who sent Him,
with the Holy Ghost:  To whom be glory for ever and ever.  Amen.

<span id="ii.xvii-p35"></span>The custom of sending the bread of the
Eucharist was forbidden in the latter part of the 4th century by the
Synod of Laodicea, Canon 14:  “At Easter the Host shall no more be sent
into foreign dioceses as *eulogiae*.”  Bp. Hefele (*Councils* II. p.
308) says—“It was a custom in the ancient Church, not indeed to
consecrate, but to bless those of the several breads of the same form
laid on the altar which were not needed for the Communion, and to employ
them partly for the maintenance of the Clergy, and partly for
distributing them to those of the faithful who did not communicate at
the Mass.”  See Eusebius (*Hist. Eccles*. V. 24), with the note thereon

<span id="ii.xvii-p43"></span> There is so close a resemblance between
the remainder of this Lecture and the explanation of the same Article of
the Creed by Rufinus, that “I have no doubt,” says the Benedictine
Editor, “that Rufinus drew from Cyril’s fountains.”  Cf. Rufin. *de

*Parthians and Medes and Elamites*.  These Jewish converts of the day of
Pentecost would naturally be the first heralds of the Gospel in their
respective countries.  On the dispersion of the Apostles, “Parthia,
according to tradition, was allotted to Thomas as his field of labour”
(Euseb. *Hist. Eccl*. III. 1; cf. I. 13).  An earlier notice of the
tradition is found in the *Clementine Recognitions*, L. IX. c. 29, where
the Pseudo-Clement professes to have received a letter from “Thomas, who
is preaching the Gospel among them.”

11.19](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#019.md)<span
id="ii.xvii-p112.1"></span>.  R.V. *Let us destroy the tree with the
fruit thereof.*  The word rendered *fruit* is literally *bread*.  The
phrase is evidently proverbial.  The Hebrew word which means “destroy”
is misinterpreted by <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.xvii-p112.2"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.xvii-p112.3"></span>μβάλωμεν</span> in the Greek.  Hence arose
the fanciful application of the passage to the cross laid on the body of
Christ to be borne by Him.  Justin M. (*Tryph*. lxxii.) charges the Jews
with having recently cut out the passage because of the supposed
reference to Christ.  Tertullian (*adv. Judæos*, c. 10) writes:  “Of
course on His body that ‘wood’ was put; for so Christ has revealed,
calling His body ‘bread.’”  He gives the same interpretation elsewhere
(*adv. Marcion*. III. 19; IV. 40).  Cf. Cyprian (*Testimonia ad
Quirinum*, Lib. II. 15); Athanas. (*de Incarn*. § 33).

<span id="ii.xvii-p210"></span> The house of Caiaphas and Pilate’s
Prætorium (§ 41), and Mount Zion itself (Cat. xvi. 18), on which they
both stood are described by Cyril as being in his time ruined and
desolate.  Eusebius (*Dem. Ev*. VIII. 406), referring to the prophecy of
Micah ([Micah 3.12](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#012.md)<span
id="ii.xvii-p210.1"></span>), repeated by Jeremiah ([Jer.
26.18](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#018.md)<span
id="ii.xvii-p210.2"></span>), that *Zion shall be plowed as a field, and
Jerusalem shall become heaps*, testifies that he had seen with his own
eyes the place being ploughed and sown by strangers, and adds that in
his own time the stones for both public and private buildings were taken
from the ruins.  The Bordeaux Pilgrim (333 <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.xvii-p210.3"></span>a.d.</span>) says, “It is evident where the
house of Caiaphas the Priest was; and there is still the pillar at which
Christ was scourged:”  this pillar is described by Jerome (*Ep*. 86) as
supporting the portico of the Church which by his time had been built on
the spot.  Prudentius *circ.* 400 <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.xvii-p210.4"></span>a.d.</span>):—

Caiphae.…
