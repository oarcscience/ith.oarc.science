<p class="c42"><a name="ii.xix-p4"></A><i>I beheld till thrones were placed, and one that was ancient of days did sit,</i> and then, <i>I saw in a vision of the night, and behold one like unto the Son of Man came with the clouds of heaven, &amp;c.</i></p>  
<p class="c23"><a name="ii.xix-p5"></A>1.&#160; <span class="sc"><a name="ii.xix-p5.1"></A>We</span> preach not one advent only of Christ, but a second also, far more glorious than the former.&#160; For the former gave a view of His patience; but the latter brings with it the crown of a divine kingdom.&#160; For all things, for the most part, are twofold in our Lord Jesus Christ:&#160; a twofold generation; one, of God, before the ages; and one, of a Virgin, at the close of the ages:&#160; His descents twofold; one, the unobserved, <i>like rain on a fleece</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1810"></A><A HREF="#fn_1810"><FONT SIZE="1">1811</FONT></A>
; and a second His open coming, which is to be.&#160; In His former advent, He was wrapped in swaddling clothes in the manger; in His second, He <i>covereth Himself with light as with a garment</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1811"></A><A HREF="#fn_1811"><FONT SIZE="1">1812</FONT></A>
.&#160; In His first coming, <i>He endured the Cross, despising shame</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1812"></A><A HREF="#fn_1812"><FONT SIZE="1">1813</FONT></A>
; in His second, He comes attended by a host of Angels, receiving glory&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1813"></A><A HREF="#fn_1813"><FONT SIZE="1">1814</FONT></A>
.&#160; We rest not then upon His first advent only, but look also for His second.&#160; And as at His first coming we said, <i>Blessed is He that cometh in the Name of the Lord</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1814"></A><A HREF="#fn_1814"><FONT SIZE="1">1815</FONT></A>
, so will we repeat the same at His second coming; that when with Angels we meet our Master, we may worship Him and say, <i>Blessed is He that cometh in the Name of the Lord</i>.&#160; The Saviour comes, not to be judged again, but to judge them who judged Him; He who before held His peace when judged&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1815"></A><A HREF="#fn_1815"><FONT SIZE="1">1816</FONT></A>
, shall remind the transgressors who did those daring deeds at the Cross, and shall say, <i>These things hast thou done, and I kept silence</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1816"></A><A HREF="#fn_1816"><FONT SIZE="1">1817</FONT></A>
.&#160; Then, He came because of a divine dispensation, teaching men with persuasion; but this time they will of necessity have Him for their King, even though they wish it not.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.xix-p13"></A>2. And concerning these two comings, Malachi the Prophet says, <i>And the Lord whom ye seek shall suddenly come to His temple</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1817"></A><A HREF="#fn_1817"><FONT SIZE="1">1818</FONT></A>
; behold one coming.&#160; And again of the second coming he says, <i>And the Messenger of the covenant whom ye delight in.&#160; Behold, He cometh, saith</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1818"></A><A HREF="#fn_1818"><FONT SIZE="1">1819</FONT></A>
 <i>the Lord Almighty.&#160; But who shall abide the day of His coming? or who shall stand when He appeareth?&#160; Because He cometh in like a refiner&#146;s fire, and like fullers&#146; herb; and He shall sit as a refiner and purifier</i>.&#160; And immediately after the Saviour Himself says, <i>And I will draw near to you in judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulteresses, and against those who swear falsely in My Name</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1819"></A><A HREF="#fn_1819"><FONT SIZE="1">1820</FONT></A>
, and the rest.&#160; For this cause Paul warning us beforehand says, <i>If any man buildeth on the foundation gold, and silver, and precious stones, wood, hay, stubble; every man&#146;s work shall be made manifest; for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed in fire</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1820"></A><A HREF="#fn_1820"><FONT SIZE="1">1821</FONT></A>
.&#160; Paul also knew these two comings, when writing to Titus and saying, <i>The grace of God hath appeared which bringeth salvation unto all men, instructing us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, and godly, and righteously in this present world; looking for the blessed hope, and appearing of the glory of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1821"></A><A HREF="#fn_1821"><FONT SIZE="1">1822</FONT></A>
.&#160; Thou seest how he spoke of a first, for which he gives thanks; and of a second, to which we look forward.&#160; Therefore the words also of the Faith which we are announcing were just now delivered thus&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1822"></A><A HREF="#fn_1822"><FONT SIZE="1">1823</FONT></A>
; that we believe in Him, who also <span class="sc"><a name="ii.xix-p20.5"></A>ascended into the heavens, and sat</span>  <A NAME="page_105"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 105</FONT></A> <a name="ii.xix-Page_105"></A><span class="sc"><a name="ii.xix-p20.6"></A>down on the right hand of the Father, and shall come in glory to judge quick and dead; whose kingdom shall have no end</span>.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.xix-p21"></A>3.&#160; Our Lord Jesus Christ, then, comes from heaven; and He comes with glory at the end of this world, in the last day.&#160; For of this world there is to be an end, and this created world is to be re-made anew&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1823"></A><A HREF="#fn_1823"><FONT SIZE="1">1824</FONT></A>
.&#160; For since corruption, <i>and theft, and adultery</i>, and every sort of sins <i>have been poured forth over the earth, and blood has been mingled with blood</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1824"></A><A HREF="#fn_1824"><FONT SIZE="1">1825</FONT></A>
 in the world, therefore, that this wondrous dwelling-place may not remain filled with iniquity, this world passeth away, that the fairer world may be made manifest.&#160; And wouldest thou receive the proof of this out of the words of Scripture?&#160; Listen to Esaias, saying, <i>And the heaven shall be rolled together as a scroll; and all the stars shall fall, as leaves from a vine, and as leaves fall from a fig-tree&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1825"></A><A HREF="#fn_1825"><FONT SIZE="1">1826</FONT></A>
</i>.&#160; The Gospel also says, <i>The sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1826"></A><A HREF="#fn_1826"><FONT SIZE="1">1827</FONT></A>
</i>.&#160; Let us not sorrow, as if we alone died; the stars also shall die; but perhaps rise again.&#160; And the Lord rolleth up the heavens, not that He may destroy them, but that He may raise them up again more beautiful.&#160; Hear David the Prophet saying, <i>Thou, Lord, in the beginning didst lay the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the work of Thy hands; they shall perish, but Thou remainest</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1827"></A><A HREF="#fn_1827"><FONT SIZE="1">1828</FONT></A>
.&#160; But some one will say, Behold, he says plainly that <i>they shall perish</i>.&#160; Hear in what sense he says, <i>they shall perish</i>; it is plain from what follows; <i>And they all shall wax old as doth a garment; and as a vesture shalt Thou fold them up, and they shall be changed</i>.&#160; For as a man is said to &#8220;perish,&#8221; according to that which is written, <i>Behold, how the righteous perisheth, and no man layeth it to heart</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1828"></A><A HREF="#fn_1828"><FONT SIZE="1">1829</FONT></A>
, and this, though the resurrection is looked for; so we look for a resurrection, as it were, of the heavens also.&#160; <i>The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1829"></A><A HREF="#fn_1829"><FONT SIZE="1">1830</FONT></A>
.&#160; Here let converts from the Manichees gain instruction, and no longer make those lights their gods; nor impiously think, that this sun which shall be darkened is Christ&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1830"></A><A HREF="#fn_1830"><FONT SIZE="1">1831</FONT></A>
.&#160; And again hear the Lord saying, <i>Heaven and earth shall pass away, but My words shall not pass away</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1831"></A><A HREF="#fn_1831"><FONT SIZE="1">1832</FONT></A>
; for the creatures are not as precious as the Master&#146;s words.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.xix-p31"></A>4.&#160; The things then which are seen shall pass away, and there shall come the things which are looked for, things fairer than the present; but as to the time let no one be curious.&#160; For <i>it is not for you</i>, He says, <i>to know times or seasons, which the Father hath put in His own power</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1832"></A><A HREF="#fn_1832"><FONT SIZE="1">1833</FONT></A>
.&#160; And venture not thou to declare when these things shall be, nor on the other hand supinely slumber.&#160; For he saith, <i>Watch, for in such an hour as ye expect not the Son of Man cometh</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1833"></A><A HREF="#fn_1833"><FONT SIZE="1">1834</FONT></A>
.&#160; But since it was needful for us to know the signs of the end, and since we are looking for Christ, therefore, that we may not die deceived and be led astray by that false Antichrist, the Apostles, moved by the divine will, address themselves by a providential arrangement to the True Teacher, and say, <i>Tell us, when shall these things be, and what shall be the sign of Thy coming, and of the end of the world</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1834"></A><A HREF="#fn_1834"><FONT SIZE="1">1835</FONT></A>
?&#160; We look for Thee to come again, but <i>Satan transforms himself into an Angel of light</i>; put us therefore on our guard, that we may not worship another instead of Thee.&#160; And He, opening His divine and blessed mouth, says, <i>Take heed that no man mislead you</i>.&#160; Do you also, my hearers, as seeing Him now with the eyes of your mind, hear Him saying the same things to you; <i>Take heed that no man mislead you</i>.&#160; And this word exhorts you all to give heed to what is spoken; for it is not a history of things gone by, but a prophecy of things future, and which will surely come.&#160; Not that we prophesy, for we are unworthy; but that the things which are written will be set before you, and the signs declared.&#160; Observe thou, which of them have already come to pass, and which yet remain; and make thyself safe.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.xix-p35"></A>5.&#160; <i>Take heed that no man mislead you:&#160; for many shall come in My name, saying, I am Christ, and shall mislead many</i>.&#160; This has happened in part:&#160; for already Simon Magus has said this, and Menander&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1835"></A><A HREF="#fn_1835"><FONT SIZE="1">1836</FONT></A>
, and some others of the godless leaders of heresy; and others will say it in our days, or after us.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.xix-p37"></A>6.&#160; A second sign.&#160; <i>And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1836"></A><A HREF="#fn_1836"><FONT SIZE="1">1837</FONT></A>
.&#160; Is there then at this time war between Persians and Romans for Mesopotamia, or no?&#160; Does nation rise up against nation and kingdom against kingdom, or no?&#160; <i>And there shall be famines and pesti</i><A NAME="page_106"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 106</FONT></A> <a name="ii.xix-Page_106"></A><i>lences and earthquakes in divers places</i>.&#160; These things have already come to pass; and again, <i>And fearful sights from heaven, and mighty storms</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1837"></A><A HREF="#fn_1837"><FONT SIZE="1">1838</FONT></A>
.&#160; <i>Watch therefore</i>, He says; <i>for ye know not at what hour your Lord doth come</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1838"></A><A HREF="#fn_1838"><FONT SIZE="1">1839</FONT></A>
.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.xix-p42"></A>7.&#160; But we seek our own sign of His coming; we Churchmen seek a sign proper to the Church&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1839"></A><A HREF="#fn_1839"><FONT SIZE="1">1840</FONT></A>
.&#160; And the Saviour says, <i>And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1840"></A><A HREF="#fn_1840"><FONT SIZE="1">1841</FONT></A>
.&#160; If thou hear that bishops advance against bishops, and clergy against clergy, and laity against laity even unto blood, be not troubled&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1841"></A><A HREF="#fn_1841"><FONT SIZE="1">1842</FONT></A>
; for it has been written before.&#160; Heed not the things now happening, but the things which are written; and even though I who teach thee perish, thou shalt not also perish with me; nay, even a hearer may become better than his teacher, and he who came last may be first, since even those about the eleventh hour the Master receives.&#160; If among Apostles there was found treason, dost thou wonder that hatred of brethren is found among bishops?&#160; But the sign concerns not only rulers, but the people also; for He says, <i>And because iniquity shall abound, the love of the many shall wax cold</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1842"></A><A HREF="#fn_1842"><FONT SIZE="1">1843</FONT></A>
.&#160; Will any then among those present boast that he entertains friendship unfeigned towards his neighbour?&#160; Do not the lips often kiss, and the countenance smile, and the eyes brighten forsooth, while the heart is planning guile, and the man is plotting mischief with words of peace?</p>  
<p><a name="ii.xix-p47"></A>8.&#160; Thou hast this sign also:&#160; <i>And this Gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations, and then shall the end come</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1843"></A><A HREF="#fn_1843"><FONT SIZE="1">1844</FONT></A>
.&#160; And as we see, nearly the whole world is now filled with the doctrine of Christ.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.xix-p49"></A>9.&#160; And what comes to pass after this?&#160; He says next, <i>When therefore ye see the abomination of desolation, which was spoken of by Daniel the Prophet, standing in the Holy Place, let him that readeth understand</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1844"></A><A HREF="#fn_1844"><FONT SIZE="1">1845</FONT></A>
.&#160; And again, <i>Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is the Christ, or, Lo, there; believe it not</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1845"></A><A HREF="#fn_1845"><FONT SIZE="1">1846</FONT></A>
.&#160; Hatred of the brethren makes room next for Antichrist; for the devil prepares beforehand the divisions among the people, that he who is to come may be acceptable to them.&#160; But God forbid that any of Christ&#146;s servants here, or elsewhere, should run over to the enemy!&#160; Writing concerning this matter, the Apostle Paul gave a manifest sign, saying, <i>For that day shall not come, except there came first the falling away, and the man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition, who opposeth and exalteth himself against all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God.&#160; Remember ye not that when I was yet with you, I told you these things?&#160; And now ye know that which restraineth, to the end that he may be revealed in his own season.&#160; For the mystery of iniquity doth already work, only there is one that restraineth now, until he be taken out of the way.&#160; And then shall the lawless one be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus shall slay with the breath of His mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of His coming.&#160; Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan, with all power and signs and lying wonders, and with all deceit of unrighteousness for them that are perishing</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1846"></A><A HREF="#fn_1846"><FONT SIZE="1">1847</FONT></A>
.&#160; Thus wrote Paul, and now is the falling away.&#160; For men have fallen away from the right faith&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1847"></A><A HREF="#fn_1847"><FONT SIZE="1">1848</FONT></A>
; and some preach the identity of the Son with the Father&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1848"></A><A HREF="#fn_1848"><FONT SIZE="1">1849</FONT></A>
, and others dare to say that Christ <A NAME="page_107"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 107</FONT></A> <a name="ii.xix-Page_107"></A>was brought into being out of nothing&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1849"></A><A HREF="#fn_1849"><FONT SIZE="1">1850</FONT></A>
.&#160; And formerly the heretics were manifest; but now the Church is filled with heretics in disguise&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1850"></A><A HREF="#fn_1850"><FONT SIZE="1">1851</FONT></A>
.&#160; For men have fallen away from the truth, and <i>have itching ears</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1851"></A><A HREF="#fn_1851"><FONT SIZE="1">1852</FONT></A>
.&#160; Is it a plausible discourse? all listen to it gladly.&#160; Is it a word of correction? all turn away from it.&#160; Most have departed from right words, and rather choose the evil, than desire the good&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1852"></A><A HREF="#fn_1852"><FONT SIZE="1">1853</FONT></A>
.&#160; This therefore is <i>the falling away</i>, and the enemy is soon to be looked for:&#160; and meanwhile he has in part begun to send forth his own forerunners&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1853"></A><A HREF="#fn_1853"><FONT SIZE="1">1854</FONT></A>
, that he may then come prepared upon the prey.&#160; Look therefore to thyself, O man, and make safe thy soul.&#160; The Church now charges thee before the Living God; she declares to thee the things concerning Antichrist before they arrive.&#160; Whether they will happen in thy time we know not, or whether they will happen after thee we know not; but it is well that, knowing these things, thou shouldest make thyself secure beforehand.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.xix-p60"></A>10.&#160; The true Christ, the Only-begotten Son of God, comes no more from the earth.&#160; If any come making false shows&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1854"></A><A HREF="#fn_1854"><FONT SIZE="1">1855</FONT></A>
 in the wilderness, go not forth; if they say, <i>Lo, here is the Christ, Lo, there, believe it not</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1855"></A><A HREF="#fn_1855"><FONT SIZE="1">1856</FONT></A>
.&#160; Look no longer downwards and to the earth; for the Lord descends from heaven; not alone as before, but with many, escorted by tens of thousands of Angels; nor secretly as the dew on the fleece&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1856"></A><A HREF="#fn_1856"><FONT SIZE="1">1857</FONT></A>
; but shining forth openly as the lightning.&#160; For He hath said Himself, <i>As the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west, so shall also the coming of the Son of Man be</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1857"></A><A HREF="#fn_1857"><FONT SIZE="1">1858</FONT></A>
; and again, <i>And they shall see the Son of Man coming upon the clouds with power and great glory, and He shall send forth His Angels with a great trumpet</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1858"></A><A HREF="#fn_1858"><FONT SIZE="1">1859</FONT></A>
; and the rest.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.xix-p66"></A>11.&#160; But as, when formerly He was to take man&#146;s nature, and God was expected to be born of a Virgin, the devil created prejudice against this, by craftily preparing among idol-worshippers&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1859"></A><A HREF="#fn_1859"><FONT SIZE="1">1860</FONT></A>
 fables of false gods, begetting and begotten of women, that, the falsehood having come first, the truth, as he supposed, might be disbelieved; so now, since the true Christ is to come a second time, the adversary, taking occasion by&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1860"></A><A HREF="#fn_1860"><FONT SIZE="1">1861</FONT></A>
 the expectation of the simple, and especially of them of the circumcision, brings in a certain man who is a magician&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1861"></A><A HREF="#fn_1861"><FONT SIZE="1">1862</FONT></A>
, and most expert in sorceries and enchantments of beguiling craftiness; who shall seize for himself the power of the Roman empire, and shall falsely style himself Christ; by this name of Christ deceiving the Jews, who are looking for the Anointed&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1862"></A><A HREF="#fn_1862"><FONT SIZE="1">1863</FONT></A>
, and seducing those of the Gentiles by his magical illusions.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.xix-p71"></A>12.&#160; But this aforesaid Antichrist is to come when the times of the Roman empire shall have been fulfilled, and the end of the world is now drawing near&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1863"></A><A HREF="#fn_1863"><FONT SIZE="1">1864</FONT></A>
.&#160; There shall rise up together ten kings of the Romans, reigning in different parts perhaps, but all about the same time; and after these an eleventh, the Antichrist, who by his magical craft shall seize upon the Roman power; and of the kings who reigned before him, <i>three he shall humble</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1864"></A><A HREF="#fn_1864"><FONT SIZE="1">1865</FONT></A>
, and the remaining seven he shall keep in subjection to himself.&#160; At first indeed he will put on a show of mildness (as though he were a learned and discreet person), and of soberness and benevolence&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1865"></A><A HREF="#fn_1865"><FONT SIZE="1">1866</FONT></A>
:&#160; and by the lying <A NAME="page_108"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 108</FONT></A> <a name="ii.xix-Page_108"></A>signs and wonders of his magical deceit&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1866"></A><A HREF="#fn_1866"><FONT SIZE="1">1867</FONT></A>
 having beguiled the Jews, as though he were the expected Christ, he shall afterwards be characterized by all kinds of crimes of inhumanity and lawlessness, so as to outdo all unrighteous and ungodly men who have gone before him; displaying against all men, but especially against us Christians, a spirit murderous and most cruel, merciless and crafty&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1867"></A><A HREF="#fn_1867"><FONT SIZE="1">1868</FONT></A>
.&#160; And after perpetrating such things for three years and six months only, he shall be destroyed by the glorious second advent from heaven of the only-begotten Son of God, our Lord and Saviour Jesus, the true Christ, who shall slay Antichrist <i>with the breath of His mouth</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1868"></A><A HREF="#fn_1868"><FONT SIZE="1">1869</FONT></A>
, and shall deliver him over to the fire of hell.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.xix-p79"></A>13.&#160; Now these things we teach, not of our own invention, but having learned them out of the divine Scriptures used in the Church&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1869"></A><A HREF="#fn_1869"><FONT SIZE="1">1870</FONT></A>
, and chiefly from the prophecy of Daniel just now read; as Gabriel also the Archangel interpreted it, speaking thus:&#160; <i>The fourth beast shall be a fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall surpass all kingdoms</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1870"></A><A HREF="#fn_1870"><FONT SIZE="1">1871</FONT></A>
.&#160; And that this kingdom is that of the Romans, has been the tradition of the Church&#146;s interpreters.&#160; For as the first kingdom which became renowned was that of the Assyrians, and the second, that of the Medes and Persians together, and after these, that of the Macedonians was the third, so the fourth kingdom now is that of the Romans&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1871"></A><A HREF="#fn_1871"><FONT SIZE="1">1872</FONT></A>
.&#160; Then Gabriel goes on to interpret, saying, <i>His ten horns are ten kings that shall arise; and another king shall rise up after them, who shall surpass in wickedness all who were before him</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1872"></A><A HREF="#fn_1872"><FONT SIZE="1">1873</FONT></A>
; (he says, not only the ten, but also all who have been before him;) <i>and he shall subdue three kings</i>; manifestly out of the ten former kings:&#160; but it is plain that by subduing three of these ten, he will become the eighth king; <i>and he shall speak words against the Most High</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1873"></A><A HREF="#fn_1873"><FONT SIZE="1">1874</FONT></A>
.&#160; A blasphemer the man is and lawless, not having received the kingdom from his fathers, but having usurped the power by means of sorcery.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.xix-p85"></A>14.&#160; And who is this, and from what sort of working?&#160; Interpret to us, O Paul.&#160; <i>Whose coming</i>, he says, <i>is after the working of Satan, with all power and signs and lying wonders</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1874"></A><A HREF="#fn_1874"><FONT SIZE="1">1875</FONT></A>
; implying, that Satan has used him as an instrument, working in his own person through him; for knowing that his judgment shall now no longer have respite, he wages war no more by his ministers, as is his wont, but henceforth by himself more openly&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1875"></A><A HREF="#fn_1875"><FONT SIZE="1">1876</FONT></A>
.&#160; And <i>with all signs and lying wonders</i>; for the father of falsehood will make a show&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1876"></A><A HREF="#fn_1876"><FONT SIZE="1">1877</FONT></A>
 of the works of falsehood, that the multitudes may think that they see a dead man raised, who is not raised, and lame men walking, and blind men seeing, when the cure has not been wrought.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.xix-p90"></A>15.&#160; And again he says, <i>Who opposeth and exalteth himself against all that is called God, or that is worshipped</i>; (<i>against every God</i>; Antichrist forsooth will abhor the idols,) <i>so that he seateth himself in the temple of God</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1877"></A><A HREF="#fn_1877"><FONT SIZE="1">1878</FONT></A>
.&#160; What temple then?&#160; He means, the Temple of the Jews which has been destroyed.&#160; For God forbid that it should be the one in which we are!&#160; Why say we this?&#160; That we may not be supposed to favour ourselves.&#160; For if he comes to the Jews as Christ, and desires to be worshipped by the Jews, he will make great account of the Temple, that he may more completely beguile them; making it supposed that he is the man of the race of David, who shall build up the Temple which was erected by Solomon&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1878"></A><A HREF="#fn_1878"><FONT SIZE="1">1879</FONT></A>
.&#160; And Antichrist will come at the time when there shall not be left one stone upon another in the Temple of the Jews, according to the doom pronounced by our Saviour&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1879"></A><A HREF="#fn_1879"><FONT SIZE="1">1880</FONT></A>
; for when, either <A NAME="page_109"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 109</FONT></A> <a name="ii.xix-Page_109"></A>decay of time, or demolition ensuing on pretence of new buildings, or from any other causes, shall have overthrown all the stones, I mean not merely of the outer circuit, but of the inner shrine also, where the Cherubim were, then shall he come <i>with all signs and lying wonders</i>, exalting himself against all idols; at first indeed making a pretence of benevolence, but afterwards displaying his relentless temper, and that chiefly against the Saints of God.&#160; For he says, <i>I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1880"></A><A HREF="#fn_1880"><FONT SIZE="1">1881</FONT></A>
; and again elsewhere, <i>there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation upon earth, even to that same time</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1881"></A><A HREF="#fn_1881"><FONT SIZE="1">1882</FONT></A>
.&#160; Dreadful is that beast, a mighty dragon, unconquerable by man, ready to devour; concerning whom though we have more things to speak out of the divine Scriptures, yet we will content ourselves at present with thus much, in order to keep within compass.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.xix-p96"></A>16.&#160; For this cause the Lord knowing the greatness of the adversary grants indulgence to the godly, saying, <i>Then let them which be in Jud&aelig;a flee to the mountains</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1882"></A><A HREF="#fn_1882"><FONT SIZE="1">1883</FONT></A>
.&#160; But if any man is conscious that he is very stout-hearted, to encounter Satan, let him stand (for I do not despair of the Church&#146;s nerves), and let him say, <i>Who shall separate us from the love of Christ and the rest</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1883"></A><A HREF="#fn_1883"><FONT SIZE="1">1884</FONT></A>
?&#160; But, let those of us who are fearful provide for our own safety; and those who are of a good courage, stand fast: <i>for then shall be great tribulation, such as hath not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, nor ever shall be</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1884"></A><A HREF="#fn_1884"><FONT SIZE="1">1885</FONT></A>
.&#160; But thanks be to God who hath confined the greatness of that tribulation to a few days; for He says, <i>But for the elect&#146;s sake those days shall be shortened</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1885"></A><A HREF="#fn_1885"><FONT SIZE="1">1886</FONT></A>
; and Antichrist shall reign for three years and a half only.&#160; We speak not from apocryphal books, but from Daniel; for he says, <i>And they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and half a time</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1886"></A><A HREF="#fn_1886"><FONT SIZE="1">1887</FONT></A>
<i>.&#160; A time</i> is the one year in which his coming shall for a while have increase; and <i>the times</i> are the remaining two years of iniquity, making up the sum of the three years; and <i>the half a time</i> is the six months.&#160; And again in another place Daniel says the same thing, <i>And he sware by Him that liveth for ever that it shall be for a time, and times, and half a time</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1887"></A><A HREF="#fn_1887"><FONT SIZE="1">1888</FONT></A>
.&#160; And some peradventure have referred what follows also to this; namely, <i>a thousand two hundred and ninety days</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1888"></A><A HREF="#fn_1888"><FONT SIZE="1">1889</FONT></A>
; and this, <i>Blessed is he that endureth and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1889"></A><A HREF="#fn_1889"><FONT SIZE="1">1890</FONT></A>
.&#160; For this cause we must hide ourselves and flee; for perhaps <i>we shall not have gone over the cities of Israel, till the Son of Man be come</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1890"></A><A HREF="#fn_1890"><FONT SIZE="1">1891</FONT></A>
.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.xix-p106"></A>17.&#160; Who then is the blessed man, that shall at that time devoutly witness for Christ?&#160; For I say that the Martyrs of that time excel all martyrs.&#160; For the Martyrs hitherto have wrestled with men only; but in the time of Antichrist they shall do battle with Satan in his own person&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1891"></A><A HREF="#fn_1891"><FONT SIZE="1">1892</FONT></A>
.&#160; And former persecuting kings only put to death; they did not pretend to raise the dead, nor did they make false shows&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1892"></A><A HREF="#fn_1892"><FONT SIZE="1">1893</FONT></A>
 of signs and wonders.&#160; But in his time there shall be the evil inducement both of fear and of deceit, <i>so that if it be possible the very elect shall be deceived</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1893"></A><A HREF="#fn_1893"><FONT SIZE="1">1894</FONT></A>
.&#160; Let it never enter into the heart of any then alive to ask, &#8220;What did Christ more?&#160; For by what power does this man work these things?&#160; Were it not God&#146;s will, He would not have allowed them.&#8221;&#160; The Apostle warns thee, and says beforehand, <i>And for this cause God shall send them a working of error</i>; (<i>send</i>, that is, <i>shall allow to happen</i>;) not that they might make excuse, but <i>that they might be condemned</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1894"></A><A HREF="#fn_1894"><FONT SIZE="1">1895</FONT></A>
.&#160; Wherefore?&#160; <i>They</i>, he says, <i>who believed not the truth</i>, that is, the true Christ, <i>but had pleasure in unrighteousness</i>, that is, in Antichrist.&#160; But as in the persecutions which happen from time to time, so also then God will permit these things, not because He wants power to hinder them, but because according to His wont He will through patience crown His own champions like as He did His Prophets and Apostles; to the end that having toiled for a little while they may inherit the eternal kingdom of heaven, according to that which Daniel says, <i>And at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book</i> (manifestly, the book of life); <i>and many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and same to shame and everlasting contempt; and they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and of the many righteous</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1895"></A><A HREF="#fn_1895"><FONT SIZE="1">1896</FONT></A>

 of the Father; for the wills of the Father and of the Son are not different, but one and the same.&#160; What then says the Judge, as to whether thou shalt bear thy works, or no?&#160; <i>And before Him shall they gather all nations</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1941"></A><A HREF="#fn_1941"><FONT SIZE="1">1942</FONT></A>

?&#160; By thy vesture shalt thou be known for a sheep.&#160; But if thou be found hairy, like Esau, who was rough with hair, and wicked in mind, who for food lost his birthright and sold his privilege, thou shalt be one of those on the left hand.&#160; But God forbid that any here present should be cast out from grace, or for evil deeds be found among the ranks of the sinners on the left hand!</p>  
<p><a name="ii.xix-p169"></A>26.&#160; Terrible in good truth is the judgment, and terrible the things announced.&#160; The kingdom of heaven is set before us, and everlasting fire is prepared.&#160; How then, some one will say, are we to escape the fire?&#160; And how to enter into the kingdom?&#160; <i>I was an hungered</i>, He says, <i>and ye gave Me meat</i>.&#160; Learn hence the way; there is here no need of allegory, but to fulfil what is said.&#160; <i>I was an hungered, and ye gave Me meat; I was thirsty, and ye gave Me drink; I was a stranger, and ye took Me in; naked, and ye clothed Me; I was sick, and ye visited Me; I was in prison, and ye came unto Me</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1944"></A><A HREF="#fn_1944"><FONT SIZE="1">1945</FONT></A>
.&#160; These things if thou do, thou shalt reign together with Him; but if thou do them not, thou shalt be condemned.&#160; At once then begin to do these works, and abide in the faith; lest, like the foolish virgins, tarrying to buy oil, thou be shut out.&#160; Be not confident because thou merely possessest the lamp, but constantly keep it burning.&#160; Let the light of thy good works shine before men&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1945"></A><A HREF="#fn_1945"><FONT SIZE="1">1946</FONT></A>

.&#160; Consider this text.&#160; Heretics of this day teach in disparagement of Christ, while Gabriel the Archangel taught the eternal abiding of the Saviour; whom then wilt thou rather believe? wilt thou not rather give credence to Gabriel?&#160; Listen to the testimony of Daniel in the text&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1953"></A><A HREF="#fn_1953"><FONT SIZE="1">1954</FONT></A>
; I saw in a vision of the night, and behold, one like the Son of Man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days.&#8230;.And to Him was given the honour, and the dominion, and the kingdom:&#160; and all peoples, tribes, and languages shall serve Him; His dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and His kingdom shall not be destroyed&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1954"></A><A HREF="#fn_1954"><FONT SIZE="1">1955</FONT></A>

.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.xix-p187"></A>29.&#160; And wouldest thou know how they who teach the contrary ran into such madness?&#160; They read wrongly that good word of the Apostle, <i>For He must reign, till He hath put all enemies under His feet</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1959"></A><A HREF="#fn_1959"><FONT SIZE="1">1960</FONT></A>
; and they say, when His enemies shall have been put under His feet, He shall cease to reign, wrongly and foolishly alleging this.&#160; For He who is king before He has subdued His enemies, how shall He not the rather be king, after He has gotten the mastery over them.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.xix-p189"></A>30.&#160; They have also dared to say that the Scripture, <i>When all things shall be subjected unto Him, then shall the Son also Himself be subjected unto Him that subjected all things unto Him</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1960"></A><A HREF="#fn_1960"><FONT SIZE="1">1961</FONT></A>
,&#8212;that this Scripture shews that the Son also shall be absorbed into the Father.&#160; Shall ye then, O most impious of all men, ye the creatures of Christ, continue? and shall Christ perish, by whom both you and all things were made?&#160; Such a word is blasphemous.&#160; But further, how shall all things be made subject unto Him?&#160; By perishing, or by abiding?&#160; Shall then the other things, when subject to the Son abide, and shall the Son, when subject to the Father, not abide?&#160; For He shall be subjected, not because He shall then begin to do the Father&#146;s will (for from eternity He <i>doth</i> always <i>those things that please Him&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1961"></A><A HREF="#fn_1961"><FONT SIZE="1">1962</FONT></A>
</i>), but because, then as before, He obeys the Father, yielding, not a forced obedience, but a self-chosen accordance; for He is not a servant, that He should be subjected by force, but a Son, that He should comply of His free choice and natural love.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.xix-p192"></A><A NAME="page_114"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 114</FONT></A> <a name="ii.xix-Page_114"></A>31.&#160; But let us examine them; what is the meaning of &#8220;until&#8221; or &#8220;as long as?&#8221;&#160; For with the very phrase will I close with them, and try to overthrow their error.&#160; Since they have dared to say that the words, <i>till He hath put His enemies under His feet</i>, shew that He Himself shall have an end, and have presumed to set bounds to the eternal kingdom of Christ, and to bring to an end, as far as words go, His never-ending sovereignty, come then, let us read the like expressions in the Apostle:&#160; <i>Nevertheless, death reigned from Adam till Moses</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1962"></A><A HREF="#fn_1962"><FONT SIZE="1">1963</FONT></A>
.&#160; Did men then die up to that time, and did none die any more after Moses, or after the Law has there been no more death among men?&#160; Well then, thou seest that the word &#8220;unto&#8221; is not to limit time; but that Paul rather signified this,&#8212;&#8220;And yet, though Moses was a righteous and wonderful man, nevertheless the doom of death, which was uttered against Adam, reached even unto him, and them that came after him; and this, though they had not committed the like sins as Adam, by his disobedience in eating of the tree.&#8221;</p>  
<p><a name="ii.xix-p194"></A>32.&#160; Take again another similar text.&#160; <i>For until this day&#8230;when Moses is read, a vail lieth upon their heart&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1963"></A><A HREF="#fn_1963"><FONT SIZE="1">1964</FONT></A>
</i>.&#160; Does <i>until this day</i> mean only &#8220;until Paul?&#8221;&#160; Is it not <i>until this day</i> present, and even to the end?&#160; And if Paul say to the Corinthians, <i>For we came even as far as unto you in preaching the Gospel of Christ, having hope when your faith increases to preach the Gospel in the regions beyond you</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1964"></A><A HREF="#fn_1964"><FONT SIZE="1">1965</FONT></A>
, thou seest manifestly that <i>as far as</i> implies not the end, but has something following it.&#160; In what <i>sense then shouldest thou remember that Scripture, till</i> He hath put all enemies under His feet&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1965"></A><A HREF="#fn_1965"><FONT SIZE="1">1966</FONT></A>
?&#160; According as Paul says in another place, <i>And exhort each other daily, while it is called to-day</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1966"></A><A HREF="#fn_1966"><FONT SIZE="1">1967</FONT></A>
; meaning, &#8220;continually.&#8221;&#160; For as we may not speak of the &#8220;beginning of the days&#8221; of Christ, so neither suffer thou that any should ever speak of the end of His kingdom.&#160; For it is written, <i>His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1967"></A><A HREF="#fn_1967"><FONT SIZE="1">1968</FONT></A>
.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.xix-p200"></A>33.&#160; And though I have many more testimonies out of the divine Scriptures, concerning the kingdom of Christ which has no end for ever, I will be content at present with those above mentioned, because the day is far spent.&#160; But thou, O hearer, worship only Him as thy King, and flee all heretical error.&#160; And if the grace of God permit us, the remaining Articles also of the Faith shall be in good time declared to you.&#160; And may the God of the whole world keep you all in safety, bearing in mind the signs of the end, and remaining unsubdued by Antichrist.&#160; Thou hast received the tokens of the Deceiver who is to come; thou hast received the proofs of the true Christ, who shall openly come down from heaven.&#160; Flee therefore the one, the False one; and look for the other, the True.&#160; Thou hast learnt the way, how in the judgment thou mayest be found among those on the right hand; guard <i>that which is committed to thee</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1968"></A><A HREF="#fn_1968"><FONT SIZE="1">1969</FONT></A>
 concerning Christ, and be conspicuous in good works, that thou mayest stand with a good confidence before the Judge, and inherit the kingdom of heaven:&#8212;Through whom, and with whom, be glory to God with the Holy Ghost, for ever and ever.&#160; Amen.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="ii.xix-p45"></A> &#8220;S. Cyril here describes the state of the Church, when orthodoxy was for a while trodden under foot, its maintainers persecuted, and the varieties of Arianism, which took its place, were quarreling for the ascendancy.&#160; Gibbon quotes two passages, one from a pagan historian of the day, another from a Father of the Church, which fully bear out S. Cyril&#146;s words.&#160; What made the state of things still more deplorable, was the defection of some of the orthodox party, as Marcellus, into opposite errors:&#160; while the subsequent secessions of Apollinaris and Lucifer show what lurking disorders there were within it at the time when S. Cyril wrote.&#160; (Vid. <i>infr</i>. 9.)&#160; The passages referred to are as follows:&#160; &#145;The Christian Religion,&#146; says Ammianus, &#145;in itself plain and simple, he (Constantius) confounded by the dotage of superstition.&#160; Instead of reconciling the parties by the weight of his authority, he cherished and propagated, by vain disputes, the differences which his vain curiosity had excited.&#160; The highways were covered with troops of Bishops, galloping from every side to the assemblies, which they called synods; and while they laboured to reduce the whole sect to their own particular opinions, the public establishment of the posts was almost ruined by their hasty and repeated journeys.&#146;&#160; <i>Hist</i>. xxi. 16.&#160; S. Hilary of Poictiers thus speaks of Asia Minor, the chief seat of the Arian troubles:&#160; &#145;It is a thing equally deplorable and dangerous, that there are as many creeds as opinions among men, as many doctrines as inclinations, and as many sources of blasphemy as there are faults among us; because we make creeds arbitrarily, and explain them as arbitrarily.&#160; The Homoousion is rejected and received and explained away by successive synods.&#160; The partial or total resemblance of the Father and of the Son is a subject of dispute for these unhappy divines.&#160; Every year, nay, every moon, we make new creeds to describe invisible mysteries.&#160; We repent of what we have done, we defend those who repent, we anathematize those whom we defended.&#160; We condemn either the doctrine of others in ourselves, or our own in that of others; and reciprocally tearing one another to pieces, we have been the cause of each other&#146;s ruin,&#146; <i>ad Constant</i>. ii. 4, 5.&#160; Gibbon&#146;s translations are used, which, though diffuse, are faithful in their matter.&#160; What a contrast do these descriptions present to Athanasius&#146; uniform declaration, that the whole question was really settled at Nic&aelig;a, and no other synod or debate was necessary!&#8221;&#8212;(<span class="sc"><a name="ii.xix-p45.1"></A>R.W.C.</span>).&#160; Compare, for example, the account of the seditions in Antioch and in Constantinople, in Socrates, <i>Eccles. Hist</i>. i. 24; i., 12&#8211;14, and Athanas. <i>Hist. Arianorum</i>, passim.</p>
