<span id="iv.iii.v-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.iii.v-p1.1"></span>Ep. VI.</span>

<span id="iv.iii.v-p2"></span>(Written about the same time, in a more
serious vein.)

<span id="iv.iii.v-p3"></span>What I wrote before about our stay in
Pontus was in joke, not in earnest; what I write now is very much in
earnest.  O that one would place me as in the month of those former
days, <span id="fr_4732"></span>[4733](#fn_4732.md) in which I luxuriated
with you in hard living; since voluntary pain is more valuable than
involuntary delight.  O that one would give me back those psalmodies
<span id="page_448">p. 448</span> <span
id="iv.iii.v-Page_448"></span>and vigils and those sojournings with God
in prayer, and that immaterial, so to speak, and unbodied life.  O for
the intimacy and one-souledness of the brethren who were by you
divinized and exalted:  O for the contest and incitement of virtue which
we secured by written Rules and Canons; O for the loving labour in the
Divine Oracles, and the light we found in them by the guidance of the
Holy Ghost.  Or, if I may speak of lesser and slighter matters, O for
the daily courses and experiences; O for the gatherings of wood, and the
cutting of stone; O for the golden plane-tree, more precious than that
of Xerxes, under which sat, not a King enfeebled by luxury, but a Monk
worn out by hard life, which I planted and Apollos (I mean your
honourable self) watered; <span id="fr_4733"></span>[4734](#fn_4733.md) but
God gave the increase to our honour, that a memorial might remain among
you of my diligence, as in the Ark we read and believe, did Aaron’s rod
that budded. <span id="fr_4734"></span>[4735](#fn_4734.md)   To long for
all this is very easy, but it is not easy to attain it.  But do you come
to me, and conspire with me in virtue, and co-operate with me, and aid
me by your prayers to keep the profit which we used to get together,
that I may not perish by little and little, like a shadow as the day
draws to its close.  I would rather breathe you than the air, and only
live while I am with you, either actually in your presence, or virtually
by your likeness in your absence.
