id="ii.xiii-p1.1"></span>Lecture IX.</span>

<span id="ii.xiii-p2"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="ii.xiii-p2.1"></span>On the Words, Maker of Heaven and Earth, and of
All Things Visible and Invisible.</span>

<span id="ii.xiii-p3"></span><span id="ii.xiii-p3.1"></span><span
class="sc"><span id="ii.xiii-p3.2"></span>[Job xxxviii.
2-3](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#002.md)<span
id="ii.xiii-p3.3"></span></span>

<span id="ii.xiii-p4"></span>*Who is this that hideth counsel from Me,
and keepeth words in his heart, and thinketh to hide them from Me* <span
id="fr_1057"></span>[1058](#fn_1057.md) *?*

<span id="ii.xiii-p6"></span>1.  <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.xiii-p6.1"></span>To</span> look upon God with eyes of flesh is
impossible:  for the incorporeal cannot be subject to bodily sight:  and
the Only begotten Son of God Himself hath testified, saying, *No man
hath seen God at any time* <span id="fr_1058"></span>[1059](#fn_1058.md) . 
For if according to that which is written in Ezekiel any one should
understand that Ezekiel saw Him, yet what saith the Scripture?  *He saw
the likeness of the glory of the Lord* <span
id="fr_1059"></span>[1060](#fn_1059.md) ; not the Lord Himself, but *the
likeness of His glory*, not the glory itself, as it really is.  And when
he saw merely *the likeness of the glory*, and not the glory itself, he
fell to the earth from fear.  Now if the sight of the likeness of the
glory brought fear and distress upon the prophets, any one who should
attempt to behold God Himself would to a certainty lose his life,
according to the saying, *No man shall see My face and live* <span
id="fr_1060"></span>[1061](#fn_1060.md) .  For this cause God of His great
loving-kindness spread out the heaven as a veil of His proper Godhead,
that we should not perish.  The word is not mine, but the Prophet’s. 
*If Thou shalt rend the heavens, trembling will take hold of the
mountains at sight of Thee, and they will flow down* <span
id="fr_1061"></span>[1062](#fn_1061.md) .  And why dost thou wonder that
Ezekiel fell down on seeing *the likeness of the glory?* when Daniel at
the sight of Gabriel, though but a servant of God, straightway shuddered
and fell on his face, and, prophet as he was, dared not answer him,
until the Angel transformed himself into the likeness of a son of
man <span id="fr_1062"></span>[1063](#fn_1062.md) .  Now if the appearing
of Gabriel wrought trembling in the Prophets, had God Himself been seen
as He is, would not all have perished?

<span id="ii.xiii-p12"></span>2.  The Divine Nature then it is
impossible to see with eyes of flesh:  but from the works, which are
Divine, it is possible to attain to some conception of His power,
according to Solomon, who says, *For by the greatness and beauty of the
creatures proportionably the Maker of them is seen* <span
id="fr_1063"></span>[1064](#fn_1063.md) .  He said not that from the
creatures the Maker is seen, but added *proportionably*.  For God
appears the greater to every man in proportion as he has grasped a
larger survey of the creatures:  and when his heart is uplifted by that
larger survey, he gains withal a greater conception of God.

<span id="ii.xiii-p14"></span>3.  Wouldest thou learn that to comprehend
the nature of God is impossible?  The Three Children in the furnace of
fire, as they hymn the praises of God, say *Blessed art thou that
beholdest the depths, and sittest upon the Cherubim* <span
id="fr_1064"></span>[1065](#fn_1064.md) .  Tell me what is the nature of
the Cherubim, and then look upon Him who sitteth upon them.  And yet
Ezekiel the Prophet even made a description of them, as far as was
possible, saying that *every one has four faces*, one of a man, another
of a lion, another of an eagle, and another of a calf; and that each one
had six wings <span id="fr_1065"></span>[1066](#fn_1065.md) , and they had
eyes on all sides; and that under each one was a wheel of four sides. 
Nevertheless though the Prophet makes the explanation, we cannot yet
understand it even as we read.  But if we cannot understand the throne,
which he has described, how shall we be able to comprehend Him who
sitteth thereon, the Invisible and Ineffable God?  To scrutinise then
the nature of God is impossible:  but it is in our power to send up
praises of His glory for His works that are seen.

<span id="ii.xiii-p17"></span>4.  These things I say to you because of
the <span id="page_52">p. 52</span> <span
id="ii.xiii-Page_52"></span>following context of the Creed, and because
we say, <span class="sc"><span id="ii.xiii-p17.1"></span>We Believe in
One God, the Father Almighty, Maker of Heaven and Earth, and of All
Things Visible and Invisible;</span> in order that we may remember that
the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ is the same as He that made the
heaven and the earth <span id="fr_1066"></span>[1067](#fn_1066.md) , and
that we may make ourselves safe against the wrong paths of the godless
heretics, who have dared to speak evil of the All wise Artificer of all
this world <span id="fr_1067"></span>[1068](#fn_1067.md) , men who see with
eyes of flesh, but have the eyes of their understanding blinded.

<span id="ii.xiii-p20"></span>5.  For what fault have they to find with
the vast creation of God?—they, who ought to have been struck with
amazement on beholding the vaultings of the heavens:  they, who ought to
have worshipped Him who reared the sky as a dome, who out of the fluid
nature of the waters formed the stable substance of the heaven.  For God
said, *Let there be a firmament in the midst of the water* <span
id="fr_1068"></span>[1069](#fn_1068.md) .  God spake once for all, and it
stands fast, and falls not.  The heaven is water, and the orbs therein,
sun, moon, and stars are of fire:  and how do the orbs of fire run their
course in the water?  But if any one disputes this because of the
opposite natures of fire and water, let him remember the fire which in
the time of Moses in Egypt flamed amid the hail, and observe the
all-wise workmanship of God.  For since there was need of water, because
the earth was to be tilled, He made the heaven above of water that when
the region of the earth should need watering by showers, the heaven
might from its nature be ready for this purpose.

<span id="ii.xiii-p22"></span>6.  But what?  Is there not cause to
wonder when one looks at the constitution of the sun?  For being to the
sight as it were a small body he contains a mighty power; appearing from
the East, and sending forth his light unto the West:  whose rising at
dawn the Psalmist described, saying:  *And he cometh forth out of his
chamber as a bridegroom* <span id="fr_1069"></span>[1070](#fn_1069.md) . 
He was describing the brightness and moderation of his state on first
becoming visible unto men:  for when he rides at high noon, we often
flee from his blaze:  but at his rising he is welcome to all as a
bridegroom to look on.

<span id="ii.xiii-p24"></span>Observe also his arrangement (or rather
not his, but the arrangement of Him who by an ordinance determined his
course), how in summer he rises higher and makes the days longer, giving
men good time for their works:  but in winter contracts his course, that
the period of cold may be increased, and that the nights becoming longer
may contribute to men’s rest, and contribute also to the fruitfulness of
the products of the earth <span id="fr_1070"></span>[1071](#fn_1070.md) . 
See also how the days alternately respond each to other in due order, in
summer increasing, and in winter diminishing; but in spring and autumn
granting equal intervals one to another.  And the nights again complete
the like courses; so that the Psalmist also says of them, *Day unto day
uttereth speech, and night unto night proclaimeth knowledge* <span
id="fr_1071"></span>[1072](#fn_1071.md) .  For to the heretics who have no
ears, they all but cry aloud, and by their good order say, that there is
none other God save the Creator who hath set them their bounds, and laid
out the order of the Universe <span id="fr_1072"></span>[1073](#fn_1072.md)
.

<span id="ii.xiii-p32"></span>7.  But let no one tolerate any who say
that one is the Creator of the light, and another of darkness <span
id="fr_1073"></span>[1074](#fn_1073.md) :  for let him remember how Isaiah
says, *I am the God who made the light, and created darkness* <span
id="fr_1074"></span>[1075](#fn_1074.md) .  Why, O man, art thou vexed
thereat?  Why art thou offended at the time that is given thee for
rest <span id="fr_1075"></span>[1076](#fn_1075.md) ?  A servant would have
had no rest from his masters, had not the darkness necessarily brought a
respite.  And often after wearying ourselves in the day, how are we
refreshed in the night, and he who was yesterday worn with toils, rises
vigorous in the morning because of the night’s rest <span
id="fr_1076"></span>[1077](#fn_1076.md) ?  And what more helpful to wisdom
than the night <span id="fr_1077"></span>[1078](#fn_1077.md) ?  For herein
oftentimes we set before our minds the things of God; and herein we read
and contemplate the Divine Oracles.  And when is our mind most attuned
to Psalmody and <span id="page_53">p. 53</span> <span
id="ii.xiii-Page_53"></span>Prayer?  Is it not at night?  And when have
we often called our own sins to remembrance?  Is not at night <span
id="fr_1078"></span>[1079](#fn_1078.md) ?  Let us not then admit the evil
thought, that another is the maker of darkness:  for experience shews
that this also is good and useful.

<span id="ii.xiii-p39"></span>8.  They ought to have felt astonishment
and admiration not only at the arrangement of sun and moon, but also at
the well-ordered choirs of the stars, their unimpeded courses, and their
risings in the seasons due to each:  and how some are signs of summer,
and others of winter; and how some mark the season for sowing, and
others shew the commencement of navigation <span
id="fr_1079"></span>[1080](#fn_1079.md) .  And a man sitting in his ship,
and sailing amid the boundless waves, steers his ship by looking at the
stars.  For of these matters the Scripture says well, *And let them be
for signs, and for seasons, and for years* <span
id="fr_1080"></span>[1081](#fn_1080.md) , not for fables of astrology and
nativities.  But observe how He has also graciously given us the light
of day by gradual increase:  for we do not see the sun at once arise;
but just a little light runs on before, in order that the pupil of the
eye may be enabled by previous trial to look upon his stronger beam: 
see also how He has relieved the darkness of the night by rays of
moonlight.

<span id="ii.xiii-p42"></span>9.  *Who is the father of the rain?  And
who hath begotten the drops of dew <span
id="fr_1081"></span>[1082](#fn_1081.md)* ?  Who condensed the air into
clouds, and bade them carry the waters of the rain <span
id="fr_1082"></span>[1083](#fn_1082.md) , now *bringing golden-tinted
clouds from the north* <span id="fr_1083"></span>[1084](#fn_1083.md) , now
changing these into one uniform appearance, and again transforming them
into manifold circles and other shapes?  *Who can number the clouds in
wisdom* <span id="fr_1084"></span>[1085](#fn_1084.md) ?  Whereof in Job it
saith, And He knoweth the separations of the clouds <span
id="fr_1085"></span>[1086](#fn_1085.md) , *and hath bent down the heaven to
the earth* <span id="fr_1086"></span>[1087](#fn_1086.md) :  and, *He who
numbereth the clouds in wisdom*:  and, *the cloud is not rent under
Him* <span id="fr_1087"></span>[1088](#fn_1087.md) .  For so many measures
of waters lie upon the clouds, yet they are not rent:  but come down
with all good order upon the earth.  Who *bringeth the winds out of
their treasuries* <span id="fr_1088"></span>[1089](#fn_1088.md) ?  *And
who*, as we said before, *is he that hath begotten the drops of dew? 
And out of whose womb cometh the ice* <span
id="fr_1089"></span>[1090](#fn_1089.md) ?  For its substance is like water,
and its strength like stone.  And at one time the water becomes *snow
like wool*, at another it ministers to Him *who scattereth the mist like
ashes* <span id="fr_1090"></span>[1091](#fn_1090.md) , and at another it is
changed into a stony substance; since *He governs the waters as He
will* <span id="fr_1091"></span>[1092](#fn_1091.md) .  Its nature is
uniform, and its action manifold in force.  Water becomes in vines *wine
that maketh glad the heart of man:*  and in olives *oil that maketh
man’s face to shine:*  and is transformed also into *bread that
strengtheneth man’s heart* <span id="fr_1092"></span>[1093](#fn_1092.md) ,
and into fruits of all kinds which He hath created <span
id="fr_1093"></span>[1094](#fn_1093.md) .

<span id="ii.xiii-p56"></span>10.  What should have been the effect of
these wonders?  Should the Creator have been blasphemed?  Or worshipped
rather?  And so far I have said noticing of the unseen works of His
wisdom.  Observe, I pray you, the spring, and the flowers of every kind
in all their likeness still diverse one from another; the deepest
crimson of the rose, and the purest whiteness of the lily:  for these
spring from the same rain and the same earth, and who makes them to
differ?  Who fashions them?  Observe, pray, the exact care:  from the
one substance of the tree there is part for shelter, and part for divers
fruits:  and the Artificer is One.  Of the same vine part is for
burning <span id="fr_1094"></span>[1095](#fn_1094.md) , and part for
shoots, and part for leaves, and part for tendrils, and part for
clusters.

<span id="ii.xiii-p58"></span>Admire also the great thickness of the
knots which run round the reed, as the Artificer hath <span
id="page_54">p. 54</span> <span id="ii.xiii-Page_54"></span>made them. 
From one and the same earth come forth creeping things, and wild beasts,
and cattle, and trees, and food; and gold, and silver, and brass, and
iron, and stone.  The nature of the waters is but one, yet from it comes
the substance of fishes and of birds; whereby <span
id="fr_1095"></span>[1096](#fn_1095.md) as the former swim in the waters,
so the birds fly in the air.

<span id="ii.xiii-p60"></span>11.  *This great and wide sea, therein are
things creeping innumerable* <span id="fr_1096"></span>[1097](#fn_1096.md)
.  Who can describe the beauty of the fishes that are therein?  Who can
describe the greatness of the whales, and the nature <span
id="fr_1097"></span>[1098](#fn_1097.md) of its amphibious animals, how they
live both on dry land and in the waters?  Who can tell the depth and the
breadth of the sea, or the force of its enormous waves?  Yet it stays at
its bounds, because of Him who said, *Hitherto shalt thou come, and no
further, but within thyself shall thy waves be broken* <span
id="fr_1098"></span>[1099](#fn_1098.md) .  Which sea also clearly shews the
word of the command imposed upon it, since after it has run up, it
leaves upon the beach a visible line made by the waves, shewing, as it
were, to those who see it, that it has not passed its appointed bounds.

<span id="ii.xiii-p64"></span>12.  Who can discern the nature of the
birds of the air?  How some carry with them a voice of melody, and
others are variegated with all manner of painting on their wings, and
others fly up into mid air and float motionless, as the hawk:  for by
the Divine command *the hawk spreadeth out his wings and floateth
motionless, looking towards the south* <span
id="fr_1099"></span>[1100](#fn_1099.md) .  What man can behold the eagle’s
lofty flight?  If then thou canst not discern the soaring of the most
senseless of the birds, how wouldest thou understand the Maker of all?

<span id="ii.xiii-p66"></span>13.  Who among men knows even the names of
all wild beasts?  Or who can accurately discern the physiology of each? 
But if of the wild beasts we know not even the mere names, how shall we
comprehend the Maker of them?  God’s command was but one, which said,
*Let the earth bring forth wild beasts, and cattle, and creeping things,
after their kinds* <span id="fr_1100"></span>[1101](#fn_1100.md) and from
one earth <span id="fr_1101"></span>[1102](#fn_1101.md) , by one command,
have sprung diverse natures, the gentle sheep and the carnivorous lion,
and various instincts <span id="fr_1102"></span>[1103](#fn_1102.md) of
irrational animals, bearing resemblance to the various characters of
men; the fox to manifest the craft that is in men, and the snake the
venomous treachery of friends, and the neighing horse the wantonness of
young men <span id="fr_1103"></span>[1104](#fn_1103.md) , and the laborious
ant, to arouse the sluggish and the dull:  for when a man passes his
youth in idleness, then he is instructed by the irrational animals,
being reproved by the divine Scripture saying, *Go to the ant, thou
sluggard, see and emulate her ways, and become wiser than she* <span
id="fr_1104"></span>[1105](#fn_1104.md) .  For when thou seest her
treasuring up her food in good season, imitate her, and treasure up for
thyself fruits of good works for the world to come.  And again, *Go to
the bee, and learn how industrious she is* <span
id="fr_1105"></span>[1106](#fn_1105.md) :  how, hovering round all kinds of
flowers, she collects her honey for thy benefit:  that thou also, by
ranging over the Holy Scriptures, mayest lay hold of salvation for
thyself, and being filled with them mayest say, *How sweet are thy words
unto my throat, yea sweeter than honey and the honeycomb unto my
mouth* <span id="fr_1106"></span>[1107](#fn_1106.md) .

<span id="ii.xiii-p74"></span>14.  Is not then the Artificer worthy the
rather to be glorified?  For what?  If thou knowest not the nature of
all things, do the things that have been made forthwith become useless? 
Canst thou know the efficacy of all herbs?  Or canst thou learn all the
benefit which proceeds from every animal?  Ere now even from venomous
adders have come antidotes for the preservation of men <span
id="fr_1107"></span>[1108](#fn_1107.md) .  But thou wilt say to me, “The
snake is terrible.”  Fear thou the Lord, and it shall not be able to
hurt thee.  “A scorpion stings.”  Fear the Lord, and it shall not sting
thee.  “A lion is bloodthirsty.”  Fear thou the Lord, and he shall lie
down beside thee, as by Daniel.  But truly wonderful also is the action
of the animals:  how some, as the scorpion, have the sharpness in a
sting; and others have their power in their teeth; and others do battle
with their claws; while the basilisk’s power is his gaze <span
id="fr_1108"></span>[1109](#fn_1108.md) .  So then from this varied
workmanship understand the Creator’s power.

<span id="ii.xiii-p80"></span><span id="page_55">p. 55</span> <span
id="ii.xiii-Page_55"></span>15.  But these things perhaps thou knowest
not:  thou wouldest have nothing in common with the creatures which are
without thee.  Enter now into thyself, and from thine own nature
consider its Artificer.  What is there to find fault with in the framing
of thy body?  Be master of thyself, and nothing evil shall proceed from
any of thy members.  Adam was at first without clothing in Paradise with
Eve, but it was not because of his members that he deserved to be cast
out.  The members then are not the cause of sin, but they who use their
members amiss; and the Maker thereof is wise.  Who prepared the recesses
of the womb for child-bearing?  Who gave life to the lifeless thing
within it?  *Who knitted us with sinews and bones, and clothed us with
skin and flesh* <span id="fr_1109"></span>[1110](#fn_1109.md) , and, as
soon as the child was born, brought streams of milk out of the breasts? 
How grows the babe into a boy, and the boy into a youth, and then into a
man; and, still the same, passes again into an old man, while no one
notices the exact change from day to day?  Of the food, how is one part
changed into blood, and another separated for excretion, and another
part changed into flesh?  Who gives to the heart its unceasing motion? 
Who wisely guarded the tenderness of the eyes with the fence of the
eyelids <span id="fr_1110"></span>[1111](#fn_1110.md) ?  For as to the
complicated and wonderful contrivance of the eyes, the voluminous books
of the physicians hardly give us explanation.  Who distributes the one
breath to the whole body?  Thou seest, O man, the Artificer, thou seest
the wise Creator.

<span id="ii.xiii-p83"></span>16.  These points my discourse has now
treated at large, having left out many, yea, ten thousand other things,
and especially things incorporeal and invisible, that thou mayest abhor
those who blaspheme the wise and good Artificer, and from what is spoken
and read, and whatever thou canst thyself discover or conceive, *from
the greatness and beauty of the creatures mayest proportionably see the
maker of them* <span id="fr_1111"></span>[1112](#fn_1111.md) , and bending
the knee with godly reverence to the Maker of the worlds, the worlds, I
mean, of sense and thought, both visible and invisible, thou mayest with
a grateful and holy tongue, with unwearied lips and heart, praise God
and say, *How wonderful are Thy works, O Lord; in wisdom hast Thou made
them all* <span id="fr_1112"></span>[1113](#fn_1112.md) .  For to Thee
belongeth honour, and glory, and majesty, both now and throughout all
ages.  Amen.

<span id="ii.xiii-p86"></span> ————————————

<span id="ii.xiii-p87"></span><span class="c21"><span
id="ii.xiii-p87.1"></span>Appendix to Lecture IX.</span>

<span id="ii.xiii-p88"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.xiii-p88.1"></span>Note</span>.—In the manuscripts which contain
this discourse under the name of “A Homily of S. Basil *on God as
Incomprehensible*,” some portions are changed to suit that subject:  but
the conclusion especially is marked by great addition and variation,
which it is well to reproduce here.  Accordingly in place of the words
in §15:  <span class="Greek"><span id="ii.xiii-p88.2"></span>τί
μεμπτόν</span>, “What is there to find fault with?” and the following,
the manuscripts before mentioned have it thus:

<span id="ii.xiii-p89"></span>“What is there to find fault with in the
framing of the body?  Come forth into the midst and speak.  Control
thine own will, and nothing evil shall proceed from any of thy members. 
For every one of these has of necessity been made for our use.  Chasten
thy reasoning unto piety, submit to God’s commandments, and none of
these members sin in working and serving in the uses for which they were
made.  If thou be not willing, the eye sees not amiss, the ear hears
nothing which it ought not, the hand is not stretched out for wicked
greed, the foot walketh not towards injustice, thou hast no strange
loves, committest no fornication, covetest not thy neighbour’s wife. 
Drive out wicked thoughts from thine heart, be as God made thee, and
thou wilt rather give thanks to thy Creator.

<span id="ii.xiii-p90"></span>Adam at first was without clothing, faring
daintily in Paradise:  and after he had received the commandment, but
failed to keep it, and wickedly stretched forth his hand (not because
the hand wished this, but because his will stretched forth his hand to
that which was forbidden), because of his disobedience he lost also the
good things he had received.  Thus the members are not the cause of sin
to those who use them, but the wicked mind, as the Lord says, *For out
of the heart proceed evil thoughts, fornications, adulteries, envyings,
and such like*.  In what things thou choosest, therein thy limbs serve
thee; they are excellently made for the service of the soul:  they are
provided as servants to thy reason.  Guide them well by the motion of
piety; bridle them by the fear of God; bring them into subjection to the
desire <span id="page_56">p. 56</span> <span
id="ii.xiii-Page_56"></span>of temperance and abstinence, and they will
never rise up against thee to tyrannise over thee; but rather they will
guard thee, and help thee more mightily in thy victory over the devil,
while expecting also the incorruptible and everlasting crown of the
victory.  Who openeth the chambers of the womb?  Who, &c.”

<span id="ii.xiii-p91"></span>At the end of the same section, after the
words “Wise Creator,” this is found:  “Glorify Him in His unsearchable
works, and concerning Him whom thou art not capable of knowing, inquire
not curiously what His essence is.  It is better for thee to keep
silence, and in faith adore, according to the divine Word, than daringly
to search after things which neither thou canst reach, nor Holy
Scripture hath delivered to thee.  These points my discourse has now
treated at large, that thou mayest abhor those who blaspheme the wise
and good Artificer, and rather mayest thyself also say, *How wonderful
are Thy works O Lord; in wisdom hast Thou made them all*.  To Thee be
the glory, and power, and worship, with the Holy Spirit, now and ever,
and throughout all ages.  Amen.”

Instead of the epithet “laborious” (<span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.xiii-p71.2"></span>γεωργότατος</span> ) some <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.xiii-p71.3"></span>mss.</span> have “agile” or
“restless” (<span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.xiii-p71.4"></span>γοργότατος</span>).

<span id="ii.xiii-p72"></span> After the description of the ant, [Prov.
vi. 6-8](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#006.md)<span
id="ii.xiii-p72.1"></span>, there follows in the Septuagint a similar
reference to the bee:  “Or go to the bee, and learn how industrious she
is, and how comely she makes her work, and the produce of her labours
kings and commons adopt for health, and she is desired and esteemed by
all, and though feeble in strength has been exalted by her regard for
wisdom.”  The interpolation is supposed to be of Greek origin, as
containing “idiomatic Greek expressions which would not occur to a
translator from the Hebrew” (Delitzsch).

<span id="ii.xiii-p75"></span> Compare Bacon (*Natural Hist.* 965):  “I
would have trial made of two other kinds of bracelets, for comforting
the heart and spirits:  one of the trochisch of vipers, made into little
pieces of beads; for since they do great good inwards (especially for
pestilent agues), it is like they will be effectual outwards, where they
may be applied in greater quantity.  There would be trochisch likewise
made of snakes; whose flesh dried is thought to have a very good opening
and cordial virtue.”  *Ib*. 969:  “The writers of natural magic commend
the wearing of the spoil of a snake, for preserving of health.”  Thomas
Jackson (*On the Creed*, VIII. 8, § 4):  “The poisonous bitings of the
scorpion are usually cured by the oil of scorpions.”

<span id="ii.xiii-p79"></span>Compare Bacon (*De Augmentis*, VII. cap.

for it, but if you see him first, he dies.”  Bacon refers to Pliny
(*Nat. Hist*. viii. 33).

<span id="ii.xiii-p82"></span> Xenophon (*Memor. Socratis*. I. cap.

providence, that, whereas the sight is weak, the Creator furnished it
with eyelids for doors, which are opened whenever there is need to use
the sight, but are closed in sleep.”
