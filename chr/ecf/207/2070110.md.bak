<span id="iv.iv.ii.i-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.iv.ii.i-p1.1"></span>§2.  To S. Gregory of Nyssa.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.ii.i-p2"></span>(Gregory, Bishop of Nyssa, was a younger
brother of Basil the Great.  Ordained a Reader at an early age he grew
tired of his vocation, and became a professor of Rhetoric.  This gave
scandal in the Church and occasioned much grief to his friends.  Gregory
of Nazianzus, wrote him the following letter of remonstrance, which was
not without effect, for shortly afterwards he gave up his secular
avocation, and retired to the Monastery which his brother Basil had
founded in Pontus.  Here he spent several years in the study of Holy
Scripture and the best Commentators.)

<span id="iv.iv.ii.i-p3"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="iv.iv.ii.i-p3.1"></span>Ep. I.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.ii.i-p4"></span>There is one good point in my character,
and I will boast myself of one point out of many.  I am equally vexed
with myself and my friends over a bad plan.  Since, then, all are
friends and kinsfolk who live according to God, and walk by the same
Gospel, why should you not hear from me in plain words what all men are
saying in whispers?  They do not approve your inglorious glory (to
borrow a phrase from your own art), and your gradual descent to the
lower life, and your ambition, the worst of demons, according to
Euripides. <span id="fr_4740"></span>[4741](#fn_4740.md)   For what has
happened to you, O wisest of men, and for what do you condemn yourself,
that you have cast away the sacred and delightful books which you used
once to read to the people (do not be ashamed to hear this), or have
hung them up over the chimney, as men do in winter with rudders and
hoes, and have applied yourself to salt and bitter ones, and preferred
to be called a Professor of Rhetoric rather than of Christianity?  I,
thank God, would rather be the latter than the former.  Do not, my dear
friend, do not let this be longer the case, but, though it is full late,
become sober again, and come to yourself once more, and make your
apology to the faithful, and to God, and to His Altars and Sacraments,
from which you have withdrawn yourself.  And do not say to me in proud
rhetorical style, What, was I not a Christian when I practised
rhetoric?  Was I not a believer when I was engaged among the boys?  And
perhaps you will call God to witness.  No, my friend, not as thoroughly
as you ought to have been, even if I grant it you in part.  What of the
offence to others given by your present employment—to others who are
prone naturally to evil—and of the opportunity afforded them both to
think and to speak the worst of you?  Falsely, I grant, but where <span
id="page_460">p. 460</span> <span id="iv.iv.ii.i-Page_460"></span>was
the necessity?  For a man lives not for himself alone but also for his
neighbour; nor is it enough to persuade yourself, you must persuade
others also.  If you were to practise boxing in public, or to give and
receive blows in the theatre, or to writhe and twist yourself
shamefully, would you speak of yourself as having a temperate soul? 
Such an argument does not befit a wise man; it is frivolous to accept
it.  If you make a change I shall rejoice even now, said one of the
Pythagorean philosophers, lamenting the fall of a friend; but, he wrote,
if not you are dead to me.  But I will not yet say this for your sake. 
Being a friend, he became an enemy, yet still a friend, as the Tragedy
says.  But I shall be grieved (to speak gently), if you do neither
yourself see what is right, which is the highest method of all, nor will
follow the advice of others, which is the next.  Thus far my counsel. 
Forgive me that my friendship for you makes me grieve, and kindles me
both on your behalf and on behalf of the whole priestly Order, and I may
add on that of all Christians.  And if I may pray with you or for you,
may God who quickeneth the dead aid your weakness.
