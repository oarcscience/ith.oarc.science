<span id="iv.iv.vii.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.iv.vii.ix-p1.1"></span>Ep. CLVII.  To Theodore, Archbishop of
Tyana.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.vii.ix-p2"></span>(S. Gregory succeeded at the end of
<span class="sc"><span id="iv.iv.vii.ix-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> 382 in
convincing the Metropolitan and his Comprovincials of his sincerity in
desiring to retire; and so they began to cast about for a Successor. 
Gregory desired that his cousin the <span id="page_474">p. 474</span>
<span id="iv.iv.vii.ix-Page_474"></span>Chorepiscopus Eulalius should be
nominated, but the Bishops felt some jealousy at what they took to be an
attempt on his part to dictate to them, and refused to allow him to take
any part in the election, on the ground that he either never had been,
or at any rate had ceased to be one of the Bishops of the Province.  He
protested, but finding that he could not convince them he withdrew his
claim to a vote and wrote to Theodore, as follows:—)

<span id="iv.iv.vii.ix-p3"></span>Our spiritual affairs have reached
their limit:  I will not trouble you any further.  Join together:  take
your precautions:  take counsel against us:  let our enemies have the
victory:  let the canons be accurately observed, beginning with us, the
most ignorant of men.  There is no ill-will in accuracy; only do not let
the rights of friendship be impeded.  The children of my very honoured
son Nicobulus have come to the city to learn shorthand.  Be kind enough
to look upon them with a fatherly and kindly eye (for the canons do not
forbid this), but especially take care that they live near the Church. 
For I desire that they should be moulded in character to virtue by
continual association with Your Perfectness.
