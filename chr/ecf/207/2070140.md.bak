<span id="iv.iv.v.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.iv.v.viii-p1.1"></span>Ep. LXIII.  To Amphilochius the
Elder.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.v.viii-p2"></span>(In <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.v.viii-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> 374 Amphilochius was made
Bishop of Iconium; and his father, a man of the same name, was deeply
aggrieved at being thus deprived of his son, to whom he had looked to
support him in his old age, and accused Gregory of being the cause. 
Gregory, who had just lost his own father, writes to undeceive him, and
to convince him how much he dreads the burden of the responsibilities of
the episcopate for his friend as well as for himself.)

<span id="iv.iv.v.viii-p3"></span>Are you grieving?  I, of course, am
full of joy!  Are you weeping?  I, as you see, am keeping festival and
glorying in the present state of things!  Are you grieved because your
son is taken from you and promoted to honour on account of his virtue,
and do you think it a terrible misfortune that he is no longer with you
to tend your old age, and, as his custom is, to bestow on you all due
care and service?  But it is no grief to me that my father has left me
for the last journey, from which he will return to me no more, and I
shall never see him again!  Then I for my part do not blame you, nor do
I ask you for due condolence, knowing as I do that private troubles
allow no leisure for those of strangers; for no man is so friendly and
so philosophical as to be above his own suffering and to comfort another
when needing comfort himself.  But you on the contrary heap blow on
blow, when you blame me, as I hear you do, and think that your son and
my brother is neglected by us, or even betrayed by us, which is a still
heavier charge; or that we do not recognize the loss which all his
friends and relatives have suffered, and I more than all, because I had
placed in him my hopes of life, and looked upon him as the only bulwark,
the only good counsellor, and the only sharer of my piety.  And yet, on
what grounds do you form this opinion?  If on the first, be assured that
I came over to you on purpose, and because I was troubled by the rumour,
and I was ready to share your deliberations while it was still time for
consultation about the matter; and you imparted anything to me rather
than this, whether because you were in the same distress, or with some
other purpose, I know not what.  But if the last, I was prevented from
meeting you again by my grief, and the honour I owed my father, and his
funeral, over which I could not give anything precedence, and that when
my sorrow was fresh, and it would not only have been wrong but also
quite improper to be unseasonably philosophical, and above human
nature.  Moreover, I thought that I was previously engaged by the
circumstances, especially as his had come to such a conclusion as seemed
good to Him who governs all our affairs.  So much concerning this
matter.  Now I beg you to put aside your grief, which is most
unreasonable I am sure; and if you have any further grievance, bring it
forward that you may not grieve both me in part and yourself, and put
yourself in a position unworthy of your nobility, blaming me instead of
others, though I have done you no wrong, but, if I must say the truth,
have been equally tyrannized over by our common friend, although you
used to think me your only benefactor.
