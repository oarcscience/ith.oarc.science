<span id="iv.iv.iii.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.iv.iii.iv-p1.1"></span>Ep. LXV.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.iii.iv-p2"></span>(Eusebius having replied to the former
letter Gregory wrote again, having an opportunity of communicating with
his friend through one Eupraxius, a disciple of Eusebius, who passed
through Cappadocia on his way to visit his master.  This letter is
sometimes attributed to Basil.)

<span id="iv.iv.iii.iv-p3"></span>Our reverend brother Eupraxius has
always been dear to me and a true friend, but he has shewn himself
dearer and truer through his affections for you, inasmuch as even at the
present time he has hurried to your reverence, like, to use David’s
words, a hart to quench his great and unendurable thirst <span
id="fr_4745"></span>[4746](#fn_4745) with a sweet and pure spring at
your patience in tribulations.  Deign then to be his patron and mine.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.iv-p5"></span>Happy indeed are they who are
permitted to come near you, and happier still is he who can place upon
his sufferings for Christ’s sake and upon his labours for the truth, a
crown such as few of those who fear God have obtained.  For it is not an
untested virtue that you have shown, nor is it only, in a time of calm
that you have sailed aright and steered the souls of others, but you
have shone in the difficulties of temptations, and have been greater
than your persecutors, having nobly departed from the land of your
birth.  Others possess the threshold of their fathers,—we the heavenly
City; others perhaps hold our throne, but we Christ.  O what a
profitable exchange!  How little we give up, to receive how much!  We
went through fire and water, and I believe that we shall also come out
into a place of refreshment.  For God will not forsake us for ever, or
abandon the true faith to persecution, but according to the multitude of
our pains His comforts shall make us glad.  This at any rate we believe
and desire.  But do you, I beg, pray for our humility.  And as often
<span id="page_464">p. 464</span> <span
id="iv.iv.iii.iv-Page_464"></span>as occasion shall present itself bless
us without hesitation by a letter, and cheer us up by news of yourself,
as you have just been good enough to do.
