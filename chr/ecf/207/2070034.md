id="ii.xxii-p2.1"></span>On the Words, And in One Holy Catholic Church,
and in the Resurrection of the Flesh, and the Life Everlasting.</span>

<span id="ii.xxii-p3"></span><span id="ii.xxii-p3.1"></span><span
class="sc"><span id="ii.xxii-p3.2"></span>[Ezekiel xxxvii.
1](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#001.md)<span
id="ii.xxii-p3.3"></span></span>

<span id="ii.xxii-p4"></span>The hand of the Lord was upon me, and
carried me out in the Spirit of the Lord, and set me down in the midst
of the valley which was full of bones.

<span id="ii.xxii-p5"></span>1.  <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.xxii-p5.1"></span>The</span> root of all good works is the hope
of the Resurrection; for the expectation of the recompense nerves the
soul to good works.  For every labourer is ready to endure the toils, if
he sees their reward in prospect; but when men weary themselves for
nought, their heart soon sinks as well as their body.  A soldier who
expects a prize is ready for war, but no one is forward to die for a
king who is indifferent about those who serve under him, and bestows no
honours on their toils.  In like manner every soul believing in a
Resurrection is naturally careful of itself; but, disbelieving it,
abandons itself to perdition.  He who believes that his body shall
remain to rise again, is careful of his robe, and defiles it not with
fornication; but he who disbelieves the Resurrection, gives himself to
fornication, and misuses his own body, as though it were not his own. 
Faith therefore in the Resurrection of the dead, is a great commandment
and doctrine of the Holy Catholic Church; great and most necessary,
though gainsaid by many, yet surely warranted by the truth.  Greeks
contradict it <span id="fr_2240"></span>[2241](#fn_2240.md) ,
Samaritans <span id="fr_2241"></span>[2242](#fn_2241.md) disbelieve it,
heretics <span id="fr_2242"></span>[2243](#fn_2242.md) mutilate it; the
contradiction is manifold, but the truth is uniform.

<span id="ii.xxii-p9"></span>2.  Now Greeks and Samaritans together
argue against us thus.  The dead man has fallen, and mouldered away, and
is all turned into worms; and the worms have died also; such is the
decay and destruction which has overtaken the body; how then is it to be
raised?  The shipwrecked have been devoured by fishes, which are
themselves devoured.  Of them who fight with wild beasts the very bones
are ground to powder, and consumed by bears and lions.  Vultures and
ravens feed on the flesh of the unburied dead, and then fly away over
all the world; whence then is the body to be collected?  For of the
fowls who have devoured it some may chance to die in India, some in
Persia, some in the land of the Goths.  Other men again are consumed by
fire, and their very ashes scattered by rain or wind; whence is the body
to be brought together again <span id="fr_2243"></span>[2244](#fn_2243.md)
?

<span id="ii.xxii-p11"></span>3.  To thee, poor little feeble man, India
is far from the land of the Goths, and Spain from Persia; but to God,
who holds the whole *earth in the hollow of His hand* <span
id="fr_2244"></span>[2245](#fn_2244.md) , all things are near at hand. 
Impute not then weakness to God, from a comparison of thy feebleness,
but rather dwell on His power <span id="fr_2245"></span>[2246](#fn_2245.md)
.  Does then the sun, a small work of God, by one glance of his beams
give warmth to the whole world; does the atmosphere, which God has made,
encompass all things in the world; and is God, who is the Creator both
of the sun, and of the atmosphere, far off from the world?  Imagine a
mixture of seeds of different plants (for as thou art weak concerning
the faith, the examples which I allege are weak also), and that these
different seeds are contained in thy single hand; is it then to thee,
who art a man, a difficult or an easy matter to separate what is in
thine hand, and to collect each seed according to its nature, and
restore it to its own kind?  Canst thou then separate the things in
thine hand, and cannot God separate the things contained in His hand,
and restore them to their proper place?  Consider what I say, whether it
is not impious to deny it?

<span id="ii.xxii-p14"></span>4.  But further, attend, I pray, to the
very principle of justice, and come to thine own case.  Thou hast
different sorts of servants:  and some are good and some bad; <span
id="page_135">p. 135</span> <span id="ii.xxii-Page_135"></span>thou
honourest therefore the good, and smitest the bad.  And if thou art a
judge, to the good thou awardest praise, and to the transgressors,
punishment.  Is then justice observed by thee a mortal man; and with
God, the ever changeless King of all, is there no retributive
justice <span id="fr_2246"></span>[2247](#fn_2246.md) ?  Nay, to deny it is
impious.  For consider what I say.  Many murderers have died in their
beds unpunished; where then is the righteousness of God?  Yea, ofttimes
a murderer guilty of fifty murders is beheaded once; where then shall he
suffer punishment for the forty and nine?  Unless there is a judgment
and a retribution after this world, thou chargest God with
unrighteousness.  Marvel not, however, because of the delay of the
judgment; no combatant is crowned or disgraced, till the contest is
over; and no president of the games ever crowns men while yet striving,
but he waits till all the combatants are finished, that then deciding
between them he may dispense the prizes and the chaplets <span
id="fr_2247"></span>[2248](#fn_2247.md) .  Even thus God also, so long as
the strife in this world lasts, succours the just but partially, but
afterwards He renders to them their rewards fully.

<span id="ii.xxii-p17"></span>5.  But if according to thee there is no
resurrection of the dead, wherefore condemnest thou the robbers of
graves?  For if the body perishes, and there is no resurrection to be
hoped for, why does the violator of the tomb undergo punishment?  Thou
seest that though thou deny it with thy lips, there yet abides with thee
an indestructible instinct of the resurrection.

<span id="ii.xxii-p18"></span>6.  Further, does a tree after it has been
cut down blossom again, and shall man after being cut down blossom no
more?  And does the corn sown and reaped remain for the threshing floor,
and shall man when reaped from this world not remain for the threshing? 
And do shoots of vine or other trees, when clean cut off and
transplanted, come to life and bear fruit; and shall man, for whose sake
all these exist, fall into the earth and not rise again?  Comparing
efforts, which is greater, to mould from the beginning a statue which
did not exist, or to recast in the same shape that which had fallen?  Is
God then, who created us out of nothing, unable to raise again those who
exist and are fallen <span id="fr_2248"></span>[2249](#fn_2248.md) ?  But
thou believest not what is written of the resurrection, being a Greek: 
then from the analogy of nature consider these matters, and understand
them from what is seen to this day.  Wheat, it may be, or some other
kind of grain, is sown; and when the seed has fallen, it dies and rots,
and is henceforth useless for food.  But that which has rotted, springs
up in verdure; and though small when sown, springs up most beautiful. 
Now wheat was made for us; for wheat and all seeds were created not for
themselves, but for our use; are then the things which were made for us
quickened when they die, and do we for whom they were made, not rise
again after our death <span id="fr_2249"></span>[2250](#fn_2249.md) ?

<span id="ii.xxii-p21"></span>7.  The season is winter <span
id="fr_2250"></span>[2251](#fn_2250.md) , as thou seest; the trees now
stand as if they were dead:  for where are the leaves of the fig-tree?
where are the clusters of the vine?  These in winter time are dead, but
green in spring; and when the season is come, there is restored to them
a quickening as it were from a state of death.  For God, knowing thine
unbelief, works a resurrection year by year in these visible things;
that, beholding what happens to things inanimate, thou mayest believe
concerning things animate and rational.  Further, flies and bees are
often drowned in water, yet after a while revive <span
id="fr_2251"></span>[2252](#fn_2251.md) ; and species of dormice <span
id="fr_2252"></span>[2253](#fn_2252.md) , after remaining motionless during
the winter, are restored in the summer (for to thy slight thoughts like
examples are offered); and shall He who to irrational and despised
creatures grants life supernaturally, not bestow it upon us, for whose
sake He made them?

<span id="ii.xxii-p25"></span>8.  But the Greeks ask for a resurrection
of the dead still manifest; and say that, even if these creatures are
raised, yet they had not utterly mouldered away; and they require to see
distinctly some creature rise again after complete decay.  God knew
men’s unbelief, and provided for this purpose a bird, called a
Phoenix <span id="fr_2253"></span>[2254](#fn_2253.md) .  This bird, as
Clement writes, and <span id="page_136">p. 136</span> <span
id="ii.xxii-Page_136"></span>as many more relate, being the only one of
its kind <span id="fr_2254"></span>[2255](#fn_2254.md) , arrives in the
land of the Egyptians at periods of five hundred years, shewing forth
the resurrection, not in desert places, lest the occurrence of the
mystery should remain unknown, but appearing in a notable city <span
id="fr_2255"></span>[2256](#fn_2255.md) , that men might even handle what
would otherwise be disbelieved.  For it makes itself a coffin <span
id="fr_2256"></span>[2257](#fn_2256.md) of frankincense and myrrh and other
spices, and entering into this when its years are fulfilled, it
evidently dies and moulders away.  Then from the decayed flesh of the
dead bird a worm is engendered, and this worm when grown large is
transformed into a bird;—and do not disbelieve this, for thou seest the
offspring of bees also fashioned thus out of worms <span
id="fr_2257"></span>[2258](#fn_2257.md) , and from eggs which are quite
fluid thou hast seen wings and bones and sinews of birds issue. 
Afterwards the aforesaid Phoenix, becoming fledged and a full-grown
Phoenix, like the former one, soars up into the air such as it had died,
shewing forth to men a most evident resurrection of the dead.  The
Phoenix indeed is a wondrous bird, yet it is irrational, nor ever sang
praise to God; it flies abroad through the sky, but it knows not who is
the Only-begotten Son of God.  Has then a resurrection from the dead
been given to this irrational creature which knows not its Maker, and to
us who ascribe glory to God and keep His commandments, shall there no
resurrection be granted?

<span id="ii.xxii-p38"></span>9.  But since the sign of the Phoenix is
remote and uncommon, and men still disbelieve our resurrection, take
again the proof of this from what thou seest every day.  A hundred or
two hundred years ago, we all, speakers and hearers, where were we? 
Know we not the groundwork of the substance of our bodies?  Knowest thou
not how from weak and shapeless and simple <span
id="fr_2258"></span>[2259](#fn_2258.md) elements we are engendered, and out
of what is simple and weak a living man is formed? and how that weak
element being made flesh is changed into strong sinews, and bright eyes,
and sensitive nose, and hearing ears, and speaking tongue, and beating
heart, and busy hands, and swift feet, and into members of all
kinds <span id="fr_2259"></span>[2260](#fn_2259.md) ? and how that once
weak element becomes a shipwright, and a builder, and an architect, and
a craftsman of various arts, and a soldier, and a ruler, and a lawgiver,
and a king?  Cannot God then, who has made us out of imperfect
materials, raise us up when we have fallen into decay?  He who thus
flames a body out of what is vile, cannot He raise the fallen body
again?  And He who fashions that which is not, shall He not raise up
that which is and is fallen?

<span id="ii.xxii-p41"></span>10.  Take further a manifest proof of the
resurrection of the dead, witnessed month by month in the sky and its
luminaries <span id="fr_2260"></span>[2261](#fn_2260.md) .  The body of the
moon vanishes completely, so that no part of it is any more seen, yet it
fills again, and is restored to its former state <span
id="fr_2261"></span>[2262](#fn_2261.md) ; and for the perfect demonstration
of the matter, the moon at certain revolutions of years suffering
eclipse and becoming manifestly changed into blood, yet recovers its
luminous body:  God having provided this, that thou also, the man who
art formed of blood, mightest not refuse credence to the resurrection of
the dead, but mightest believe concerning thyself also what thou seest
in respect of the moon.  These therefore use thou as arguments against
the Greeks; for with them who receive not what is written fight thou
with unwritten weapons, by reasonings only and demonstrations; for these
men know not who Moses is, nor Esaias, nor the Gospels, nor Paul.

<span id="ii.xxii-p44"></span>11.  Turn now to the Samaritans, who,
receiving the Law only, allow not the Prophets.  To them the text just
now read from Ezekiel appears of no force, for, as I said, they admit no
Prophets; whence then shall we persuade the Samaritans also?  Let us go
to the writings of the Law.  Now God says to Moses, *I am the God of
Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob* <span
id="fr_2262"></span>[2263](#fn_2262.md) ; this must mean of those who have
being and subsistence.  For if Abraham has <span id="page_137">p.
137</span> <span id="ii.xxii-Page_137"></span>come to an end, and Isaac
and Jacob, then He is the God of those who have no being.  When did a
king ever say, I am the king of soldiers, whom he had not?  When did any
display wealth which he possessed not?  Therefore Abraham and Isaac and
Jacob must subsist, that God may be the God of those who have being; for
He said not, “I was their God,” but *I am*.  And that there is a
judgment, Abraham shews in saying to the Lord, *He who judgeth all the
earth, shall He not execute judgment* <span
id="fr_2263"></span>[2264](#fn_2263.md) ?

<span id="ii.xxii-p47"></span>12.  But to this the foolish Samaritans
object again, and say that the souls possibly of Abraham and Isaac and
Jacob continue, but that their bodies cannot possibly rise again.  Was
it then possible that the rod of righteous Moses should become a
serpent, and is it impossible that the bodies of the righteous should
live and rise again?  And was that done contrary to nature, and shall
they not be restored according to nature?  Again, the rod of Aaron,
though cut off and dead, budded, *without the scent of waters* <span
id="fr_2264"></span>[2265](#fn_2264.md) , and though under a roof, sprouted
forth into blossoms as in the fields; and though set in dry places,
yielded in one night the flowers and fruit of plants watered for many
years.  Did Aaron’s rod rise, as it were, from the dead, and shall not
Aaron himself be raised?  And did God work wonders in wood, to secure to
him the high-priesthood, and will He not vouchsafe a resurrection to
Aaron himself?  A woman also was made salt contrary to nature; and flesh
was turned into salt; and shall not flesh be restored to flesh?  Was
Lot’s wife made a pillar of salt, and shall not Abraham’s wife be raised
again?  By what power was Moses’ hand changed, which even within one
hour became as snow, and was restored again?  Certainly by God’s
command.  Was then His command of force then, and has it no force now?

<span id="ii.xxii-p49"></span>13.  And whence in the beginning came man
into being at all, O ye Samaritans, most senseless of all men?  Go to
the first book of the Scripture, which even you receive; *And God formed
man of the dust of the ground* <span
id="fr_2265"></span>[2266](#fn_2265.md) .  Is dust transformed into flesh,
and shall not flesh be again restored to flesh?  You must be asked too,
whence the heavens had their being, and earth, and seas?  Whence sun,
and moon, and stars?  How from the waters were made the things which fly
and swim?  And how from earth all its living things?  Were so many
myriads brought from nothing into being, and shall we men, who bear
God’s image, not be raised up?  Truly this course is full of unbelief,
and the unbelievers are much to be condemned; when Abraham addresses the
Lord as *the Judge of all the earth*, and the learners of the Law
disbelieve; when it is written that man is of the earth, and the readers
disbelieve it <span id="fr_2266"></span>[2267](#fn_2266.md) .

<span id="ii.xxii-p52"></span>14.  These questions, therefore, are for
them, the unbelievers:  but the words of the Prophets are for us who
believe.  But since some who have also used the Prophets believe not
what is written, and allege against us that passage, *The ungodly shall
not rise up in judgment* <span id="fr_2267"></span>[2268](#fn_2267.md) ,
and, *For if man go down to the grave he shall come up no more* <span
id="fr_2268"></span>[2269](#fn_2268.md) , and, *The dead shall not praise
Thee, O Lord* <span id="fr_2269"></span>[2270](#fn_2269.md) ,—for of what
is well written, they have made ill use—it will be well in a cursory
manner, and as far as is now possible, to meet them.  For if it is said,
that *the ungodly shall not rise up in judgment*, this shews that they
shall rise, not in judgment, but in condemnation; for God needs not long
scrutiny, but close on the resurrection of the ungodly follows also
their punishment.  And if it is said, *The dead shall not praise Thee, O
Lord*, this shews, that since in this life only is the appointed time
for repentance and pardon, for which they who enjoy it shall *praise the
Lord*, it remains not after death for them who have died in sins to give
praise as the receivers of a blessing, but to bewail themselves; for
praise belongs to them who give thanks, but to them who are under the
scourge, lamentation.  Therefore the just then offer praise; but they
who have died in sins have no further season for confession <span
id="fr_2270"></span>[2271](#fn_2270.md) .

<span id="ii.xxii-p57"></span>15.  And respecting that passage, *If a
man go down to the grave, he shall come up no more*, observe what
follows, for it is written, *He shall come up no more, neither shall he
return to his own house*.  For since the whole world shall pass away,
and every house shall be destroyed, how shall he return to his own
house, there being henceforth a new and different earth?  But they ought
to have heard Job, saying, *For there is hope of a tree; for if it be
cut down, it will sprout again, and the tender branch thereof will not
cease.  For though the root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock
thereof die in the rocky ground; yet from the scent of water it will
bud, and bring forth a crop like a new plant.  But man when he dies, is
gone; and when mortal man falls, is he no more* <span
id="fr_2271"></span>[2272](#fn_2271.md) ?  As it were remonstrating and
reproving (for thus ought we to <span id="page_138">p. 138</span> <span
id="ii.xxii-Page_138"></span>read the words *is no more* with an
interrogation <span id="fr_2272"></span>[2273](#fn_2272) .md); he says
since a tree falls and revives, shall not man, for whom all trees were
made, himself revive?  And that thou mayest not suppose that I am
forcing the words, read what follows; for after saying by way of
question, *When mortal man falls, is he no more?* he says, *For if a man
die, he shall live again <span id="fr_2273"></span>[2274](#fn_2273.md)* ;
and immediately he adds, *I will wait till I be made again* <span
id="fr_2274"></span>[2275](#fn_2274.md) ; and again elsewhere, *Who shall
raise up on the earth my skin, which endures these things* <span
id="fr_2275"></span>[2276](#fn_2275.md) .  And Esaias the Prophet says,
*The dead men shall rise again, and they that are in the tombs shall
awake* <span id="fr_2276"></span>[2277](#fn_2276.md) .  And the Prophet
Ezekiel now before us, says most plainly, *Behold I will open your
graves, and bring you up out of your graves* <span
id="fr_2277"></span>[2278](#fn_2277.md) .  And Daniel says, *Many of them
that sleep in the dust of the earth shall arise, some to everlasting
life, and some to everlasting shame* <span
id="fr_2278"></span>[2279](#fn_2278.md) .

<span id="ii.xxii-p66"></span>16.  And many Scriptures there are which
testify of the Resurrection of the dead; for there are many other
sayings on this matter.  But now, by way of remembrance only, we will
make a passing mention of the raising of Lazarus on the fourth day; and
just allude, because of the shortness of the time, to the widow’s son
also who was raised, and merely for the sake of reminding you, let me
mention the ruler of the synagogue’s daughter, and the rending of the
rocks, and how *there arose many bodies of the saints which slept* <span
id="fr_2279"></span>[2280](#fn_2279.md) , their graves having been opened. 
But specially be it remembered that *Christ has been raised from the
dead* <span id="fr_2280"></span>[2281](#fn_2280.md) .  I speak but in
passing of Elias, and the widow’s son whom he raised; of Elisseus also,
who raised the dead twice; once in his lifetime, and once after his
death.  For when alive he wrought the resurrection by means of his own
soul <span id="fr_2281"></span>[2282](#fn_2281.md) ; but that not the souls
only of the just might be honoured, but that it might be believed that
in the bodies also of the just there lies a power, the corpse which was
cast into the sepulchre of Elisseus, when it touched the dead body of
the prophet, was quickened, and the dead body of the prophet did the
work of the soul, and that which was dead and buried gave life to the
dead, and though it gave life, yet continued itself among the dead. 
Wherefore?  Lest if Elisseus should rise again, the work should be
ascribed to his soul alone; and to shew, that even though the soul is
not present, a virtue resides in the body of the saints, because of the
righteous soul which has for so many years dwelt in it, and used it as
its minister <span id="fr_2282"></span>[2283](#fn_2282.md) .  And let us
not foolishly disbelieve, as though this thing had not happened:  for if
handkerchiefs and aprons, which are from without, touching the bodies of
the diseased, raised up the sick, how much more should the very body of
the Prophet raise the dead?

<span id="ii.xxii-p71"></span>17.  And with respect to these instances
we might say much, rehearsing in detail the marvellous circumstances of
each event:  but as you have been already wearied both by the superposed
fast of the Preparation <span id="fr_2283"></span>[2284](#fn_2283.md) , and
by the watchings <span id="fr_2284"></span>[2285](#fn_2284.md) , let what
has been cursorily spoken concerning them suffice for a while; these
words having been as it were sown thinly, that you, receiving the seed
like richest ground, may in bearing fruit increase them.  But be it
remembered, that the Apostles also raised the dead; Peter raised Tabitha
in Joppa, and Paul raised Eutychus in Troas; and thus did all the other
Apostles, even though the wonders wrought by each have not all been
written.  Further, remember all the sayings in the first Epistle to the
Corinthians, which Paul wrote against them who said, *How are the dead
raised, and with* <span id="page_139">p. 139</span> <span
id="ii.xxii-Page_139"></span>*what manner of body do they come* <span
id="fr_2285"></span>[2286](#fn_2285.md) ?  And how he says, *For if the
dead rise not, then is not Christ raised* <span
id="fr_2286"></span>[2287](#fn_2286.md) ; and how he called them
*fools* <span id="fr_2287"></span>[2288](#fn_2287.md) , who believed not;
and remember the whole of his teaching there concerning the resurrection
of the dead, and how he wrote to the Thessalonians, *But we would not
have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep,
that ye sorrow not, even as the rest which have no hope* <span
id="fr_2288"></span>[2289](#fn_2288.md) , and all that follows:  but
chiefly that, *And the dead in Christ shall rise first* <span
id="fr_2289"></span>[2290](#fn_2289.md) .

<span id="ii.xxii-p79"></span>18.  But especially mark this, how very
pointedly <span id="fr_2290"></span>[2291](#fn_2290.md) Paul says, *For
this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on
immortality* <span id="fr_2291"></span>[2292](#fn_2291.md) .  For this body
shall be raised not remaining weak as now; but raised the very same
body, though by putting on incorruption it shall be fashioned anew <span
id="fr_2292"></span>[2293](#fn_2292.md) ,—as iron blending with fire
becomes fire, or rather as He knows how, the Lord who raises us.  This
body therefore shall be raised, but it shall abide not such as it now
is, but an eternal body; no longer needing for its life such nourishment
as now, nor stairs for its ascent, for it shall be made *spiritual*, a
marvellous thing, such as we cannot worthily speak of.  *Then*, it is
said, *shall the righteous shine forth as the sun* <span
id="fr_2293"></span>[2294](#fn_2293.md) , and the moon, *and as the
brightness of the firmament* <span id="fr_2294"></span>[2295](#fn_2294.md)
.  And God, fore-knowing men’s unbelief, has given to little worms in
the summer to dart beams of light from their body <span
id="fr_2295"></span>[2296](#fn_2295.md) , that from what is seen, that
which is looked for might be believed; for He who gives in part is able
to give the whole also, and He who made the worm radiant with light,
will much more illuminate a righteous man.

<span id="ii.xxii-p86"></span>19.  We shall be raised therefore, all
with our bodies eternal, but not all with bodies alike:  for if a man is
righteous, he will receive a heavenly body, that he may be able worthily
to hold converse with Angels; but if a man is a sinner, he shall receive
an eternal body, fitted to endure the penalties of sins, that he may
burn eternally in fire, nor ever be consumed <span
id="fr_2296"></span>[2297](#fn_2296.md) .  And righteously will God assign
this portion to either company; for we do nothing without the body.  We
blaspheme with the mouth, and with the mouth we pray.  With the body we
commit fornication, and with the body we keep chastity.  With the hand
we rob, and by the hand we bestow alms; and the rest in like manner. 
Since then the body has been our minister in all things, it shall also
share with us in the future the fruits of the past <span
id="fr_2297"></span>[2298](#fn_2297.md) .

<span id="ii.xxii-p89"></span>20.  Therefore, brethren, let us be
careful of our bodies, nor misuse them as though not our own.  Let us
not say like the heretics, that this vesture of the body belongs not to
us, but let us be careful of it as our own; for we must give account to
the Lord of all things done through the body.  Say not, none seeth me;
think not, that there is no witness of the deed.  Human witness
oftentimes there is not; but He who fashioned us, an unerring *witness*,
abides *faithful in heaven* <span id="fr_2298"></span>[2299](#fn_2298.md) ,
and beholds what thou doest.  And the stains of sin also remain in the
body; for as when a wound has gone deep into the body, even if there has
been a healing, the scar remains, so sin wounds soul and body, and the
marks of its scars remain in all; and they are removed only from those
who receive the washing of Baptism.  The past wounds therefore of soul
and body God heals by Baptism; against future ones let us one and all
jointly guard ourselves, that we may keep this vestment of the body
pure, and may not for practising fornication and sensual indulgence or
any other sin for a short season, lose the salvation of heaven, but may
inherit the eternal kingdom of God; of which may God, of His own grace,
deem all of you worthy.

<span id="ii.xxii-p91"></span>21.  Thus much in proof of the
Resurrection of the dead; and now, let me again recite to you the
profession of the faith, and do you with all diligence pronounce it
while I speak <span id="fr_2299"></span>[2300](#fn_2299.md) , and remember
it.

<span
id="ii.xxii-p93"></span>\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

<span id="ii.xxii-p94"></span>22.  The Faith which we rehearse contains
in order the following, “<span class="sc"><span
id="ii.xxii-p94.1"></span>And in one Baptism of repentance for the
remission of sins; and in one Holy Catholic Church; and in the
resurrection of the flesh; and in eternal life</span>.”  Now of Baptism
and repentance I have spoken in the earliest Lectures; and my present
remarks concerning the resurrection of the dead have been made with
reference to the Article “In the resurrection of the flesh.”  Now then
let me finish what still remains to be said for the Article, “In one
Holy Catholic Church,” on which, though one might say many things, we
will speak but briefly.

<span id="ii.xxii-p95"></span>23.  It is called Catholic then because it
<span id="page_140">p. 140</span> <span
id="ii.xxii-Page_140"></span>extends over all the world, from one end of
the earth to the other; and because it teaches universally and
completely one and all the doctrines which ought to come to men’s
knowledge, concerning things both visible and invisible, heavenly and
earthly <span id="fr_2300"></span>[2301](#fn_2300.md) ; and because it
brings into subjection to godliness the whole race of mankind, governors
and governed, learned and unlearned; and because it universally treats
and heals the whole class of sins, which are committed by soul or body,
and possesses in itself every form of virtue which is named, both in
deeds and words, and in every kind of spiritual gifts.

<span id="ii.xxii-p97"></span>24.  And it is rightly named (Ecclesia)
because it calls forth <span id="fr_2301"></span>[2302](#fn_2301.md) and
assembles together all men; according as the Lord says in Leviticus,
*And make an assembly for all the congregation at the door of the
tabernacle of witness* <span id="fr_2302"></span>[2303](#fn_2302.md) .  And
it is to be noted, that the word *assemble*, is used for the first time
in the Scriptures here, at the time when the Lord puts Aaron into the
High-priesthood.  And in Deuteronomy also the Lord says to Moses,
*Assemble the people unto Me, and let them hear My words, that they may
learn to fear Me* <span id="fr_2303"></span>[2304](#fn_2303.md) .  And he
again mentions the name of the Church, when he says concerning the
Tables, *And on them were written all the words which the Lord spake
with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the
Assembly* <span id="fr_2304"></span>[2305](#fn_2304.md) ; as if he had said
more plainly, in the day in which ye were called and gathered together
by God.  The Psalmist also says, *I will give thanks unto Thee, O Lord,
in the great Congregation; I will praise Thee among much people* <span
id="fr_2305"></span>[2306](#fn_2305.md) .

<span id="ii.xxii-p103"></span>25.  Of old the Psalmist sang, *Bless ye
God in the congregations, even the Lord, (ye that are) from the
fountains of Israel* <span id="fr_2306"></span>[2307](#fn_2306.md) .  But
after the Jews for the plots which they made against the Saviour were
cast away from His grace, the Saviour built out of the Gentiles a second
Holy Church, the Church of us Christians, concerning which he said to
Peter, *And upon this rock I will build My Church, and the gates of hell
shall not prevail against it* <span id="fr_2307"></span>[2308](#fn_2307.md)
.  And David prophesying of both these, said plainly of the first which
was rejected, *I have hated the Congregation of evil doers* <span
id="fr_2308"></span>[2309](#fn_2308.md) ; but of the second which is built
up he says in the same Psalm, *Lord, I have loved the beauty of Thine
house* <span id="fr_2309"></span>[2310](#fn_2309.md) ; and immediately
afterwards, *In the Congregations will I bless thee, O Lord* <span
id="fr_2310"></span>[2311](#fn_2310.md) .  For now that the one Church in
Judæa is cast off, the Churches of Christ are increased over all the
world; and of them it is said in the Psalms, *Sing unto the Lord a new
song, His praise in the Congregation of Saints* <span
id="fr_2311"></span>[2312](#fn_2311.md) .  Agreeably to which the prophet
also said to the Jews, *I have no pleasure in you, saith the Lord
Almighty* <span id="fr_2312"></span>[2313](#fn_2312.md) ; and immediately
afterwards, *For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of
the same, My name is glorified among the Gentiles* <span
id="fr_2313"></span>[2314](#fn_2313.md) .  Concerning this Holy Catholic
Church Paul writes to Timothy, *That thou mayest know how thou oughtest
to behave thyself in the House of God, which is the Church of the Living
God, the pillar and ground of the truth* <span
id="fr_2314"></span>[2315](#fn_2314.md) .

<span id="ii.xxii-p113"></span>26.  But since the word Ecclesia is
applied to different things (as also it is written of the multitude in
the theatre of the Ephesians, *And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed
the Assembly* <span id="fr_2315"></span>[2316](#fn_2315) .md), and since
one might properly and truly say that there is a *Church of evil doers*,
I mean the meetings of the heretics, the Marcionists and Manichees, and
the rest, for this cause the Faith has securely delivered to thee now
the Article, “And in one Holy Catholic Church;” that thou mayest avoid
their wretched meetings, and ever abide with the Holy Church Catholic in
which thou wast regenerated.  And if ever thou art sojourning in cities,
inquire not simply where the Lord’s House is (for the other sects of the
profane also attempt to call their own dens houses of the Lord), nor
merely where the Church is, but where is the Catholic Church.  For this
is the peculiar name of this Holy Church, the mother of us all, which is
the spouse of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Only-begotten Son of God (for
it is written, *As Christ also loved the Church and gave Himself for
it* <span id="fr_2316"></span>[2317](#fn_2316) , and all the rest,.md) and
is a figure and copy of *Jerusalem which is above, which is free, and
the mother of us all* <span id="fr_2317"></span>[2318](#fn_2317.md) ; which
before was barren, but now has many children.

<span id="ii.xxii-p117"></span>27.  For when the first Church was cast
off, in the second, which is the Catholic Church, God *hath set,* as
Paul says, *first Apostles, secondly Prophets, thirdly teachers, then
miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, divers kinds of
tongues* <span id="fr_2318"></span>[2319](#fn_2318.md) , and every sort of
virtue, I mean wisdom and understanding, temperance and justice, mercy
and loving-kindness, and patience unconquerable <span id="page_141">p.
141</span> <span id="ii.xxii-Page_141"></span>in persecutions.  She, *by
the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left, by honour
and dishonour* <span id="fr_2319"></span>[2320](#fn_2319.md) , in former
days amid persecutions and tribulations crowned the holy martyrs with
the varied and blooming chaplets of patience, and now in times of peace
by God’s grace receives her due honours from *kings and those who are in
high place* <span id="fr_2320"></span>[2321](#fn_2320.md) , and from every
sort and kindred of men.  And while the kings of particular nations have
bounds set to their authority, the Holy Church Catholic alone extends
her power without limit over the whole world; *for God*, as it is
written, *hath made her border peace* <span
id="fr_2321"></span>[2322](#fn_2321.md) .  But I should need many more
hours for my discourse, if I wished to speak of all things which concern
her.

<span
id="ii.xxii-p122"></span>\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

<span id="ii.xxii-p123"></span>28.  In this Holy Catholic Church
receiving instruction and behaving ourselves virtuously, we shall attain
the kingdom of heaven, and inherit <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.xxii-p123.1"></span>eternal life</span>; for which also we endure
all toils, that we may be made partakers thereof from the Lord.  For
ours is no trifling aim, but our endeavour is for eternal life. 
Wherefore in the profession of the Faith, after the words, “<span
class="sc"><span id="ii.xxii-p123.2"></span>And in the resurrection of
the flesh</span>,” that is, of the dead (of which we have discoursed),
we are taught to believe also “<span class="sc"><span
id="ii.xxii-p123.3"></span>in the life eternal</span>,” for which as
Christians we are striving.

<span id="ii.xxii-p124"></span>29.  The real and true life then is the
Father, who through the Son in the Holy Spirit pours forth as from a
fountain His heavenly gifts to all; and through His love to man, the
blessings of the life eternal are promised without fail to us men also. 
We must not disbelieve the possibility of this, but having an eye not to
our own weakness but to His power, we must believe; *for with God all
things are possible*.  And that this is possible, and that we may look
for eternal life, Daniel declares, *And of the many righteous shall they
shine as the stars for ever and ever* <span
id="fr_2322"></span>[2323](#fn_2322.md) .  And Paul says, *And so shall we
be ever with the Lord* <span id="fr_2323"></span>[2324](#fn_2323.md) :  for
the *being for ever with the Lord* implies the life eternal.  But most
plainly of all the Saviour Himself says in the Gospel, *And these shall
go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into life
eternal* <span id="fr_2324"></span>[2325](#fn_2324.md) .

<span id="ii.xxii-p128"></span>30.  And many are the proofs concerning
the life eternal.  And when we desire to gain this eternal life, the
sacred Scriptures suggest to us the ways of gaining it; of which,
because of the length of our discourse, the texts we now set before you
shall be but few, the rest being left to the search of the diligent. 
They declare at one time that it is by faith; for it is written, *He
that believeth on the Son hath eternal life* <span
id="fr_2325"></span>[2326](#fn_2325.md) , and what follows; and again He
says Himself, *Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth My word,
and believeth Him that sent Me, hath eternal life* <span
id="fr_2326"></span>[2327](#fn_2326.md) , and the rest.  At another time,
it is by the preaching of the Gospel; for He says, that *He that reapeth
receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal* <span
id="fr_2327"></span>[2328](#fn_2327.md) .  At another time, by martyrdom
and confession in Christ’s name; for He says, *And he that hateth his
life in this world, shall keep it unto life eternal* <span
id="fr_2328"></span>[2329](#fn_2328.md) .  And again, by preferring Christ
to riches or kindred; *And every one that hath forsaken brethren, or
sisters* <span id="fr_2329"></span>[2330](#fn_2329.md) , and the rest,
*shall inherit eternal life*.  Moreover it is by keeping the
commandments, *Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not
kill* <span id="fr_2330"></span>[2331](#fn_2330.md) , and the rest which
follow; as He answered to him that came to Him, and said, *Good Master,
what shall I do that I may have eternal life* <span
id="fr_2331"></span>[2332](#fn_2331.md) ?  But further, it is by departing
from evil works, and henceforth serving God; for Paul says, *But now
being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit
unto sanctification, and the end eternal life* <span
id="fr_2332"></span>[2333](#fn_2332.md) .

<span id="ii.xxii-p137"></span>31.  And the ways of finding eternal life
are many, though I have passed over them by reason of their number.  For
the Lord in His loving-kindness has opened, not one or two only, but
many doors, by which to enter into the life eternal, that, as far as lay
in Him, all might enjoy it without hindrance.  Thus much have we for the
present spoken within compass concerning <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.xxii-p137.1"></span>the life eternal</span>, which is the last
doctrine of those professed in the Faith, and its termination; which
life may we all, both teachers and hearers, by God’s grace enjoy!

<span
id="ii.xxii-p138"></span>\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

<span id="ii.xxii-p139"></span>32.  And now, brethren beloved, the word
of instruction exhorts you all, to prepare your souls for the reception
of the heavenly gifts.  As regards the Holy and Apostolic Faith
delivered to you to profess, we have spoken through the grace of the
Lord as many Lectures, as was possible, in these past days of Lent; not
that this is all we ought to have said, for many are the points omitted;
and these perchance are thought out better by more excellent teachers. 
But now the holy day of the Passover is at hand, and ye, beloved <span
id="fr_2333"></span>[2334](#fn_2333.md) in Christ, are to be enlightened
*by the Laver of regeneration*.  Ye shall therefore again be taught what
is requi<span id="page_142">p. 142</span> <span
id="ii.xxii-Page_142"></span>site, if God so will; with how great
devotion and order you must enter in when summoned, for what purpose
each of the holy mysteries of Baptism is performed, and with what
reverence and order you must go from Baptism to the Holy Altar of God,
and enjoy its spiritual and heavenly mysteries; that your souls being
previously enlightened by the word of doctrine, ye may discover in each
particular the greatness of the gifts bestowed on you by God.

<span id="ii.xxii-p141"></span>33.  And after Easter’s Holy Day of
salvation, ye shall come on each successive day, beginning from the
second day of the week, after the assembly into the Holy Place of the
Resurrection <span id="fr_2334"></span>[2335](#fn_2334.md) , and there, if
God permit, ye shall hear other Lectures; in which ye shall again be
taught the reasons of every thing which has been done, and shall receive
the proofs thereof from the Old and New Testaments,—first, of the things
done just before Baptism,—next, how ye were cleansed from your sins by
the Lord, *by the washing of water with the word* <span
id="fr_2335"></span>[2336](#fn_2335.md) ,—and how like Priests ye have
become partakers of the Name of Christ,—and how the Seal of the
fellowship of the Holy Ghost was given to you,—and concerning the
mysteries at the Altar of the New Testament, which have taken their
beginning from this place, both what the Divine Scriptures have
delivered to us, and what is the power of these mysteries, and how ye
must approach them, and when and how receive them;—and at the end of
all, how for the time to come ye must behave yourselves worthily of this
grace both in words and deeds, that you may all be enabled to enjoy the
life everlasting.  And these things shall be spoken, if it be God’s
pleasure.

<span id="ii.xxii-p144"></span>34.  *Finally, my brethren, rejoice in
the Lord alway; again I will say, Rejoice:  for your redemption hath
drawn nigh* <span id="fr_2336"></span>[2337](#fn_2336.md) , and the
heavenly host of the Angels is waiting for your salvation.  And there is
now *the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of
the Lord* <span id="fr_2337"></span>[2338](#fn_2337.md) ; and the Prophet
cries, *Ho, ye that thirst, come ye to the water* <span
id="fr_2338"></span>[2339](#fn_2338.md) ; and immediately afterwards,
*Hearken unto me, and ye shall eat that which is good, and your soul
shall delight itself in good things* <span
id="fr_2339"></span>[2340](#fn_2339.md) .  And within a little while ye
shall hear that excellent lesson which says, *Shine, shine, O thou new
Jerusalem; for thy light is come* <span
id="fr_2340"></span>[2341](#fn_2340.md) .  Of this Jerusalem the prophet
hath said, *And afterwards thou shalt be called the city of
righteousness, Zion, the faithful mother of cities* <span
id="fr_2341"></span>[2342](#fn_2341.md) ; *because of the law which went
forth out of Zion, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem* <span
id="fr_2342"></span>[2343](#fn_2342.md) , which word has from hence been
showered forth on the whole world.  To her the Prophet also says
concerning you, *Lift up thine eyes round about, and behold thy children
gathered together* <span id="fr_2343"></span>[2344](#fn_2343.md) ; and she
answers, saying, *Who are these that fly as a cloud, and as doves with
their young ones to me* <span id="fr_2344"></span>[2345](#fn_2344.md) ?
(*clouds* because of their spiritual nature, and *doves*, from their
purity).  And again, she says, *Who knoweth such things? or who hath
seen it thus? did ever a land bring forth in one day? or was ever a
nation born all at once? for as soon as Zion travailed, she brought
forth her children* <span id="fr_2345"></span>[2346](#fn_2345.md) .  And
all things shall be filled with joy unspeakable because of the Lord who
said, *Behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a
joy* <span id="fr_2346"></span>[2347](#fn_2346.md) .

<span id="ii.xxii-p156"></span>35.  And may these words be spoken now
again over you also, *Sing, O heavens, and be joyful, O earth*; and
then; *for the Lord hath had mercy on His people, and comforted the
lowly of His people* <span id="fr_2347"></span>[2348](#fn_2347.md) .  And
this shall come to pass through the loving-kindness of God, who says to
you, *Behold, I will blot out as a cloud thy transgressions, and as a
thick cloud thy sins* <span id="fr_2348"></span>[2349](#fn_2348.md) .  But
ye who have been counted worthy of the name of Faithful (of whom it is
written, *Upon My servants shall be called a new name which shall be
blessed on the earth* <span id="fr_2349"></span>[2350](#fn_2349) ,.md) ye
shall say with gladness, *Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord
Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the
heavenly places in Christ* <span id="fr_2350"></span>[2351](#fn_2350.md)
*:  in whom we have our redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of
our sins, according to the riches of His grace, wherein He abounded
towards us* <span id="fr_2351"></span>[2352](#fn_2351.md) , and what
follows; and again, *But God being rich in mercy, for His great love
wherewith He loved us, when we were dead through our trespasses,
quickened us together with Christ* <span
id="fr_2352"></span>[2353](#fn_2352.md) , and the rest.  And again in like
manner praise ye the Lord of all good things, saying, *But when the
kindness of God our Saviour, and His love towards man appeared, not by
works of righteousness which we had done, but according to His mercy He
saved us, through the washing of regeneration, and the renewing of the
Holy Ghost, which He shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our
Saviour, that being* <span id="page_143">p. 143</span> <span
id="ii.xxii-Page_143"></span>*justified by His grace, we might be made
heirs, according to hope, of eternal life* <span
id="fr_2353"></span>[2354](#fn_2353.md) .  And may God Himself the Father
of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, *give unto you a spirit
of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Himself, the eyes of your
understanding being enlightened* <span
id="fr_2354"></span>[2355](#fn_2354.md) , and may He ever keep you in good
works, and words, and thoughts; to Whom be glory, honour, and power,
through our Lord Jesus Christ, with the Holy Ghost, now and ever, and
unto all the endless ages of eternity.  Amen <span
id="fr_2355"></span>[2356](#fn_2355.md) .

<span id="ii.xxii-p20"></span> An eloquent statement of the argument for
the resurrection from the analogies of nature occurs in Tertull. *De
Resurr.* c. xii.  That it was not unknown to Cyril, seems probable from
the concluding sentence:  “And surely if all things rise again for man,
for whom they have been provided—but not for man unless for his flesh
also—how can the flesh itself perish utterly, for the sake and service
of which nothing is allowed to perish.”  Tertullian himself was probably
indebted, as Bp. Lightfoot suggests, to Clemens. Rom. *Epist. ad
Corinth.* xxiv.  Cf. Lactant. *Div. Inst.* vii. 4.

<span id="ii.xxii-p24"></span> The <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.xxii-p24.1"></span>μυοξός</span> is supposed by the Benedictine
Editor to be the toad (“Inventusque cavis bufo,” Virg. *Georg*. i. 185),
by others the marmot (mus Alpinus).  More probably it is the dormouse
(myoxis glis), which stores up provisions for the winter, though it
sleeps through much of that season.

<span id="ii.xxii-p26"></span> The story of the Phœnix as told by
Herodotus, II. 73, is as follows:  “They have also another sacred bird
called the Phœnix, which I myself have never seen, except in pictures. 
Indeed it is a great rarity even in Egypt, only coming there (according
to the accounts of the people of Heliopolis) once in five hundred years,
when the old phœnix dies.…They tell a story of what this bird does,
which does not seem to me to be credible; that he comes all the way from
Arabia, and brings the parent bird, all plastered over with myrrh, to
the temple of the Sun, and there buries the body.”

<span id="ii.xxii-p27"></span>The many variations and fabulous
accretions of the story are detailed by Suicer, *Thesaurus*, <span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.xxii-p27.1"></span>Φοῖνιξ</span>, and by Bp.
Lightfoot in a long and interesting note on Clemens Rom. *Epist. ad
Cor.* xxv.  Cyril borrows the story from Clement almost verbally, yet
not without some variations, which will be noticed below.  The legend
with all its miraculous features is told by Ovid, *Metamorph*. xv. 392,
by Claudian, *Phœnix*, and by the Pseudo-Lactantius in an Elegiac poem,
*Phœnix*, included in Weber’s *Corpus Poetarum Latinorum*, and literally
translated in Clark’s *Ante-Nicene Library*.  See also Tertull. *De

them as remedies and a protection against evil, originated in the 4th
century.  They first (?) appear in writings, none of which are earlier
than the year 370:  but they prevailed rapidly when they had once taken
root” (Scudamore, *Dict. Chr. Antiq.* “Relics,” p. 1770).  Bingham
(*Ant*. xxiii. 4, § 7) quotes a law of Theodosius, “that no one should
remove any dead body that was buried, from one place to another; that no
one should sell or buy the relics of Martyrs:  but if any one was minded
to build over the grave where a martyr was buried, a church to be called
a *martyrium*, in respect to him, he should have liberty to do it.”  The
law wholly failed to suppress a superstition which was sanctioned by
such men as Cyril, Basil, Chrysostom, Ambrose, and Augustine.

class="Greek"><span id="ii.xxii-p72.3"></span>τῆς ὑπερθέσεως</span> we
have rendered, according to the interpretation received among the
Latins, by the word ‘superpositio.’  The ancients meant by it a fast
continued for two or three days without food.  Moreover, since the great
week was observed with severer fastings, there were many who passed
either the whole week or four, three, or two days, namely the
Preparation and the Holy Sabbath (Easter Eve), entirely fasting as is
testified by S. Irenæus (Euseb. *Hist*. V. 24) and others.  The
continuance of the fast throughout the Friday and Saturday was highly
approved, as may be seen from the *Apostolical Constitutions*, V. 18.” 
The passage referred to is as follows:  “Do you therefore fast on the
days of the Passover, beginning from the second day of the week until
the Preparation and the Sabbath, six days, making use only of bread, and
salt, and herbs, and water for your drink:  but abstain on these days
from wine and flesh, for they are days of lamentation and not of
fasting.  Do ye who are able fast throughout the Preparation and the
Sabbath entirely, tasting nothing till the cockcrowing at night; but if
any one is not able to combine them both, let the Sabbath at least be
observed.”

<span id="fn_2284"></span>[138:2285](2070034.htm#fr_2284.md) <span
id="ii.xxii-p72.4"></span>

<span id="ii.xxii-p73"></span> The fast of the Great Sabbath was to be
continued through the night, as prescribed in the *Apost. Const*. V.
19:  “Continue until cock-crowing and break off your fast at dawn of the
first day of the week, which is the Lord’s day, keeping awake from
evening until cock-crowing:  and assembling together in the Church,
watch and pray and beseech God, in your night-long vigil, reading the
Law, the Prophets, and the Psalms, until the crowing of the cocks:  and
after baptizing your Catechumens, and reading the Gospel in fear and
trembling, and speaking to the people the things pertaining to
salvation, so cease from your mourning.”  A chief reason for the
watching was that Christ was expected to return at the same hour in
which He rose.  On the meaning of “superposition” see Routh’s note on
the Synodical Epistle of Irenæus to Victor of Rome (*Rell. Sac.* ii. p.
45, ss.), and the passage of Dionysius of Alexandria there quoted.

<span id="ii.xxii-p96"></span> Bishop Lightfoot (Ignatius*, ad
Smyrnæos*, viii.) traces the original and later senses of the word
“Catholic” very fully.  “In its earliest usages, therefore, as a
fluctuating epithet of <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.xxii-p96.1"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.xxii-p96.2"></span>κκλησία</span>, ‘catholic’ means ‘universal,’
as opposed to ‘individual,’ ‘particular.’  In its later sense, as a
fixed attribute, it implies orthodoxy as opposed to heresy, conformity
as opposed to dissent.”  Commenting on this passage of Cyril, the Bishop
adds that “these two latter reasons, that it (the Church) is
comprehensive in doctrine, and that it is universal in application, can
only be regarded as secondary glosses.”

<span id="ii.xxii-p165"></span> “At the end of this Lecture in the older
of the Munich <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.xxii-p165.1"></span>mss</span>. there is the following addition: 
Many other Lectures were delivered year by year, both before Baptism and
after the neophytes had been baptized.  But these alone were taken down
when spoken and written by some of the earnest students in the year 352
of the advent of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.  And in these you
will find partly discussions of all the necessary doctrines of the Faith
which ought to be known to men, and answers to the Greeks, and to those
of the Circumcision, and to the Heresies, and the moral precepts of
Christians of all kinds, by the grace of God.  The year 352 according to
the computation of the Greeks is the year 360 of the Christian era”
(Rupp).

<span id="ii.xxii-p166"></span>The date at which the Lectures were
delivered cannot possibly be so late as is here stated.  See the section
of the Introduction on the “Date.”
