<span id="iv.iv.ix.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.iv.ix.xiii-p1.1"></span>To Olympius.  Ep. CXLVI.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.ix.xiii-p2"></span>This is what I said as if by a sort
of prophecy, when I found you favourable to every request, and was
making insatiable use of your gentleness, that I fear I shall exhaust
your kindness upon the affairs of others.  For see, a contest of my own
has come (if that is mine which concerns my own relations), and I cannot
speak with the same freedom.  First, because it is my own.  For to
entreat for myself, though it may be more useful, is more humiliating. 
And next, I am afraid of excess as destroying pleasure, and opposing all
that is good.  So matters stand, and I conjecture only too rightly. 
Nevertheless with confidence in God before Whom I stand, and in your
magnanimity in doing good, I am bold to present this petition.

<span id="iv.iv.ix.xiii-p3"></span>Suppose Nicobulus to be the worst of
men:—though his only crime is that through me he is an object of envy,
and more free than he ought to be.  And suppose that my present opponent
is the most just of men.  For I am ashamed to accuse before Your
Uprightness one whom yesterday I was supporting:  but I do not know if
it will seem to you just that punishment should be demanded for one
man’s crimes from another, though these were quite strange to him, and
had not even his consent; from the man who has so stirred his household
and been so upset as to have surrendered to his accuser more readily
than the latter wished.  Must Nicobulus or his children be reduced to
slavery as his persecutors desire?  I am ashamed both of the ground of
the persecution and of the time, if this is to be done while both you
are in power and I have influence with you.  Not so, most admirable
friend, let not this be suggested to Your Integrity.  But recognizing by
the winged swiftness of your mind the malice from which this proceeds,
and having respect to me your admirer, shew yourself a merciful judge to
those who are being disturbed—for to-day you are not merely judging
between man and man, but between virtue and vice; and to this more
consideration than by an ordinary man must be given by those who are
like you in virtue and are skilful governors.  And in return for this
you shall have from me not only the matter of my prayers, which I know
you do not, like so many men, despise; but also that I will make your
government famous with all to whom I am known.
