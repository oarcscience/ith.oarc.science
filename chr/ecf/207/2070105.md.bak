id="iv.iv.i.i-p4.1"></span>Ep. VII.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.i.i-p5"></span>(On the death of the Emperor Constantius
the undisputed succession devolved on his cousin Julian the Apostate,
who at once began to employ all the power of the Empire to discourage,
while not absolutely persecuting, Christianity, and to restore the
supremacy of the ancient Paganism.  One of his first acts was to dismiss
all the men who had held high dignities under his predecessor.  S.
Cæsarius, Gregory’s brother, was however to be excepted; Julian, who had
perhaps known and esteemed him at Athens, did all that he could to keep
him at Court, and to attach him to himself.  This caused much anxiety to
Gregory and other friends of Cæsarius, who foresaw that Julian would do
his utmost to shake the young man’s faith, and could not feel sure that
he would have courage to resist such assaults.  In his trouble Gregory
wrote him the following letter.  Shortly afterwards the expected attempt
was made.  S. Cæsarius bravely held his ground against the Emperor, and
after declaring his unalterable determination to hold firm to his faith,
resigned his office at Court and withdrew to Nazianzus.)

<span id="iv.iv.i.i-p6"></span>I have had enough to blush for in you;
that I was grieved, it is hardly necessary to say to him who of all men
knows me best.  But, not to speak of my own feelings, or of the distress
with which the rumour about you filled me (and let me say also the
fear), I should have liked you, had it been possible, to have heard what
was said by others, both relations and outsiders, who are any way
acquainted with us (Christians I mean, of course,) about you and me; and
not only some of them, but everyone in turn alike; for men are always
more ready to philosophize about strangers than about their own
relations.  Such speeches as the following have become a sort of
exercise among them:  Now a Bishop’s son takes service in the army; now
he covets exterior power and fame; now he is a slave of money, when the
fire is being rekindled for all, and men are running the race for life;
and he does not deem the one only glory and safety and wealth to be to
stand nobly against the times, and to place himself as far as possible
out of reach of every abomination and defilement.  How then can the
Bishop exhort others not to be carried along with the times, or to be
mixed up with idols?  How can he rebuke those who do wrong in other
ways, seeing his own home takes away his right to speak freely?  We have
every day to hear this, and even more severe things, some of the
speakers perhaps saying them from a motive of friendship, and others
with unfriendly feelings.  How do you think we feel, and what is the
state of mind with which we, men professing to serve God, and to deem
the only good to be to look forward to the hopes of the future, hear
such things as these?  Our venerable Father is very much distressed by
all that he hears, which even disgusts him with life.  I console and
comfort him as best I can, by making myself surety for your mind, and
assuring him that you will not continue thus to grieve us.  But if our
dear Mother were to hear about you (so far we have kept her in the dark
by various devices), I think she would be altogether inconsolable;
being, as a woman, of a weak mind, and besides unable, through her great
piety, to control her feelings on such matters.  If then you care at all
for yourself and us, try some better and safer course.  Our means are
certainly enough for an independent life, at least for a man of moderate
desires, who is not insatiable in his lust for more.  Moreover, I do not
see what occasion for your settling down we are to wait for, if we let
this one pass.  But if you cling to the same opinion, and every <span
id="page_458">p. 458</span> <span id="iv.iv.i.i-Page_458"></span>thing
seems to you of small account in comparison with your own desires, I do
not wish to say anything else that may vex you, but this I foretell and
protest, that one of two things must happen; either you, remaining a
genuine Christian, will be ranked among the lowest, and will be in a
position unworthy of yourself and your hopes; or in grasping at honours
you will injure yourself in what is more important, and will have a
share in the smoke, if not actually in the fire.
