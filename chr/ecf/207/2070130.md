id="iv.iv.iv.vi-p1.1"></span>Ep. XCIII.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.iv.vi-p2"></span>(Written soon after Gregory’s
resignation of the Archbishopric.)

<span id="iv.iv.iv.vi-p3"></span>Our retreat and leisure and quiet have
about them something very agreeable to me; but the fact that they cut me
off from your friendship and society is not so advantageous but rather
the other way.  Others enjoy your Perfection, to me it would be really a
great boon if I might have just that shadow of conversation which comes
in a letter.  Shall I see you again?  Shall I embrace again him of whom
I am so proud, and shall this be granted to the remnant of my life?  If
so, all thanks to God:  if not, the best part of my life is over.  Pray
remember your friend Gregory and pray for him.
