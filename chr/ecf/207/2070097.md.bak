<span id="iv.iii.xviii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.iii.xviii-p1.1"></span>Ep. XLVIII.  To Basil.</span>

<span id="iv.iii.xviii-p2"></span>(Shortly after the events described
above, Basil determined to strengthen his own hands by creating a number
of new Bishoprics in the disputed Province, to one of which, Sasima, he
consecrated Gregory, very much against the will of the latter, who felt
that he had been hardly used, and did not attempt to disguise his
reluctance.  See Gen. Prolegg. p. 195.)

<span id="iv.iii.xviii-p3"></span>Do leave off speaking of me as an
ill-educated and uncouth and unfriendly man, not even worthy to live,
because I have ventured to be conscious of the way in which I have been
treated.  You yourself would admit that I have not done wrong in any
other respect, and my own conscience does not reproach me with having
been unkind to you in either great or small matters; and I hope it never
may.  I only know that I saw that I had been deceived—too late indeed,
but I saw it—and I throw the blame on your throne, as having on a sudden
lifted you above yourself; and I am weary of being blamed for faults of
yours, and of having to make excuses for them to people who know both
our former and our present relations.  For of all that I have to endure
this is the most ridiculous or most pitiable thing, that the same person
should have both to suffer the wrong and to bear the blame, and this is
my present case.  Different people blame me for different things
according to the tastes of each, or each man’s disposition, or the
measure of their ill feeling on my account; but the kindest reproach me
with contempt and disdain, and they throw me on one side after making
use of me, like the most valueless vessels, or those frames upon which
arches are built, which after the building is complete are taken down
and cast aside.  We will let them be and say what they please; no one
shall curb their freedom of speech.  And do you, as my reward, pay off
those blessed and empty hopes, which you devised against the evil
speakers, who accused you of insulting me on pretence of honouring me,
as though I were lightminded and easily taken in by such treatment.  Now
I will plainly speak out the state of my mind, and you must not be angry
with me.  For I will tell you just what I said at the moment of the
suffering, not in a fit of anger or so much in the sense of astonishment
at what had happened as to lose my reason or not to know what I said.  I
will not take up arms, nor will I learn tactics which I did not learn in
former times, when the occasion seemed more suitable, as every one was
arming and in frenzy (you know the illness of the weak), nor will I face
the martial Anthimus, though he be an untimely warrior, being myself
unarmed and unwarlike, and thus the more exposed to wounds.  Fight with
him yourself if you wish (for necessity often makes warriors even of the
weak), or look out for some one to fight when he seizes your mules,
keeping guard over a defile, and like Amalek of old, barring the way
against Israel.  Give me before all things quiet.  Why should I fight
for sucking pigs and fowls, and those not my own, as though for souls
and canons?  Why should I deprive the Metropolis of the celebrated
Sasima, or lay bare and unveil the secret of your mind, when I ought to
join in concealing it?  Do you then play the man and be strong and draw
all parties to your own conclusion, as the rivers do the winter
torrents, without regard for friendship or intimacy in good, or for the
reputation which such a course will bring you.  Give yourself up to the
Spirit alone.  I shall gain this only from your friendship, that I shall
learn not to trust in friends, or to esteem anything more valuable than
God.
