<span id="iv.iii.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.iii.vi-p1.1"></span>Ep. VIII.</span>

<span id="iv.iii.vi-p2"></span>(Written to S. Basil shortly after his
Ordination as Priest, probably toward the end of <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.vi-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> 362.)

<span id="iv.iii.vi-p3"></span>I approve the beginning of your letter;
but what is there of yours that I do not approve?  And you are convicted
of having written just like me; <span
id="fr_4735"></span>[4736](#fn_4735) for I, too, was forced into the
rank of the Priesthood, for indeed I never was eager for it.  We are to
one another, if ever any men were, trustworthy witnesses of our love for
a humble and lowly philosophy.  But perhaps it would have been better
that this had not happened, or I know not what to say, as long as I am
in ignorance of the purpose of the Holy Ghost.  But since it has come
about, we must bear it, at least so it seems clear to me; and especially
when we take the times into consideration, which are bringing in upon us
so many heretical tongues, and must not put to shame either the hopes of
those who have trusted us thus, or our own lives.

<span id="iv.iii.vi-p4"></span> The Editors render “And you were
captured just as I also was circumscribed,” etc., but the Greek hardly
bears this rendering.
