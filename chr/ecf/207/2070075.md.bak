<span id="iv.ii.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.ii.ii-p1.1"></span>To Nectarius, Bishop of Constantinople.  (Ep.
CCII.)</span>

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p2"></span>The Care of God, which throughout the time
before us guarded the Churches, seems to have utterly forsaken this
present life.  And my soul is immersed to such a degree by calamities
that the private sufferings of my own life hardly seem to be worth
reckoning among evils (though they are so numerous and great, that if
they befel anyone else I should think them unbearable); but I can only
look at the common sufferings of the Churches; for if at the present
crisis some pains be not taken to find a remedy for them, things will
gradually get into an altogether desperate condition.  Those who follow
the heresy of Arius or Eudoxius (I cannot say who stirred them up to
this folly) are making a display of their disease, as if they had
attained some degree of confidence by collecting congregations as if by
permission.  And they of the Macedonian party have reached such a pitch
of folly that they are arrogating to themselves the name of Bishops, and
are wandering about our districts babbling of Eleusius <span
id="fr_4693"></span>[4694](#fn_4693.md) as to their ordinations.  Our bosom
evil, Eunomius, is no longer content with merely existing; but unless he
can draw away everyone with him to his ruinous heresy, he thinks himself
an injured man.  All this, however, is endurable.  The most grievous
item of all in the woes of the Church is the boldness of the
Apollinarians, whom your Holiness has overlooked, I know not how, when
providing themselves with authority to hold meetings on an equality with
myself.  However, you being, as you are, thoroughly instructed by the
grace of God in the Divine Mysteries on all points, are well informed,
not only as to the advocacy of the true faith, but also as to all those
arguments which have been devised by the heretics against the sound
faith; and yet perhaps it will not be unseasonable that your Excellency
should hear from my littleness that a pamphlet by Apollinarius has come
into my hands, the contents of which surpass all heretical pravity.  For
he asserts that the Flesh which the Only-begotten Son assumed in the
Incarnation for the remodelling of our nature was no new acquisition,
but that that carnal nature was in the Son from the beginning.  And he
puts forward as a witness to this monstrous assertion a garbled
quotation from the Gospels, namely, No man hath Ascended up into Heaven
save He which came down from Heaven, even the Son of Man which is in
Heaven. <span id="fr_4694"></span>[4695](#fn_4694.md)   As though even
before He came down He was the Son of Man, and when He came down He
brought with Him that Flesh, which it appears He had in Heaven, as
though it had existed before the ages, and been joined with His
Essence.  For he alleges another saying of an Apostle, which he cuts off
from the whole body of its context, that The Second Man is the Lord from
Heaven. <span id="fr_4695"></span>[4696](#fn_4695.md)   Then he assumes
that that Man who came down from above is without a mind, but that the
Godhead of the Only-begotten fulfils the function of mind, and is the
third part of this human composite, inasmuch as soul and body are in it
on its human side, but not mind, the place of which is taken by God the
Word.  This is not yet the most serious part of it; that which is most
terrible of all is that he declares that the Only-begotten God, the
Judge of all, the Prince of Life, the Destroyer of Death, is mortal, and
underwent the Passion in His proper Godhead; and that in the three days’
death of His body, His Godhead also was put to death with His body, and
thus was raised again from the dead by the Father.  It would be tedious
to go through all the other propositions which he adds to these
monstrous absurdities.  Now, if they who hold such views have authority
to meet, your Wisdom approved in Christ must see that, inasmuch as we do
not approve their views, any permission of assembly granted to them is
nothing less than a declaration that their view is thought more true
than ours.  For if they are permitted to teach their view as godly men,
and with all confidence to preach their doctrine, it is manifest that
the doctrine of the Church has been condemned, as though the truth were
on their side.  For nature does not admit of two contrary doctrines on
the same subject being both true.  How then could your noble and lofty
mind submit to suspend your usual courage in regard to the correction of
so great an evil?  But even though there is no precedent for such a
course, let your inimitable perfection in virtue stand up at a crisis
like the present, and teach our most pious <span id="page_439">p.
439</span> <span id="iv.ii.ii-Page_439"></span>Emperor, that no gain
will come from his zeal for the Church on other points if he allows such
an evil to gain strength from freedom of speech for the subversion of
sound faith.

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p3"></span> Eleusius was Bishop of Cyzicus, a
prominent leader of the Semi-Arian party.  He bore a very high character
for personal holiness, and approached more nearly to orthodoxy than most
of his associates, men like Basil of Ancyra, Eustathius of Sebaste,
etc.  He obstinately maintained, however, Macedonian views on the Deity
of the Holy Ghost, even after their condemnation by the Council of
Constantinople.
