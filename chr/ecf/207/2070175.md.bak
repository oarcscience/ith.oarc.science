id="iv.iv.ix.v-p1.1"></span>Ep. CXXVI.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.ix.v-p2"></span>(While Gregory was at Xantharis an
opportunity presented itself for seeing Olympius, but a return of
illness prevented him from taking advantage of it.  He writes to express
his regret, and takes the opportunity also to request that Nicobulus may
be exempted from the charge of the Imperial Posts.)

<span id="iv.iv.ix.v-p3"></span>I was happy in a dream.  For having been
brought as far as the Monastery to obtain some comfort from the bath,
and then hoping to meet you, and having this good fortune almost in my
hands, and having delayed a few days, I was suddenly carried away by my
illness, which was already painful in some respects and threatening in
others.  And, if one must find some conjecture to account for the
misfortune, I suffered in the same way as the polypods do, which if torn
by force from the rocks risk the loss of the suckers by which they
attach themselves to the rocks, or carry off some portion of the
latter.  Something of this kind is my case.  And what I should have
asked Your Excellency for had I seen you, I now venture to ask for
though I am absent.  I found my son Nicobulus much worried by the care
of the Post, and by close attention to the Monastery.  He is not a
strong man, and has great distaste for solitude.  Make use of him for
anything else you please, for he is eager to serve your authority in all
things; but if it be possible set him free from this charge, if for no
other reason, at any rate to do him honour as my Hospitaller.  Since I
have asked many favours from you for many people, and have obtained
them, I need also your kindness for myself.
