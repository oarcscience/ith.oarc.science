id="iv.iv.ix.xiv-p1.1"></span>Ep. CLIV.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.ix.xiv-p2"></span>To me you are Prefect even after the
expiry of your term of office—for I judge things differently from the
run of men—because you embrace in yourself every prefectoral virtue. 
For many of those who sit on lofty thrones are to me base, all those
whose hand makes them base and slaves of their subjects. <span
id="fr_4781"></span>[4782](#fn_4781.md)   But many are high and lofty
though they stand low, whom virtue places on high and makes worthy of
greater government.  But what have I to do with this?  No longer is the
great Olympius with us, nor does he bear our rudder-lines.  We are
undone, we are betrayed, we have become again the Second Cappadocia,
after having been made the First by you.  Of other men’s <span
id="page_482">p. 482</span> <span
id="iv.iv.ix.xiv-Page_482"></span>matters why should I speak? but who
will cherish the old age of your Gregory, and administer to his weakness
the enchantment of honours, and make him more honourable because he
obtains kindness for many from you?  Now then depart on your journey
with escort and greater pomp, leaving behind for us many tears, and
carrying with you much wealth, and that of a kind which few Prefects do,
good fame, and the being inscribed on all hearts, pillars not easily
moved.  If you preside over us again with greater and more illustrious
rule, (this is what our longing augurs), we shall offer to God more
perfect thanks.
