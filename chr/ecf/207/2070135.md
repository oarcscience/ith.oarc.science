id="iv.iv.v.iii-p1.1"></span>Ep. XXV.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.v.iii-p2"></span>(Amphilochius was acquitted of the
charges made against him, referred to in former letters; but the result
of the accusation on his own mind was such that he resigned his office,
and retired to a sort of hermitage at a place called Ozizala, not far
from Nazianzus, where he devoted his hours of labour to the cultivation
of vegetables.  The four letters which follow are of no special
importance, and are only given as specimens of the lighter style which
Gregory could use with his intimate friends.)

<span id="iv.iv.v.iii-p3"></span>I did not ask you for bread, just as I
would not ask for water from the inhabitants of Ostracine.  But if I
were to ask for vegetables from a man of Ozizala it were no strange
thing, nor too great a strain on friendship; for you have plenty of
them, and we a great dearth.  I beg you then to send me some vegetables,
and plenty of them, and the best quality, or as many as you can (for
even small things are great to the poor); for I am going to receive the
great Basil, and you, who have had experience of him full and
philosophical, would not like to know him hungry and irritated.
