<span id="iv.iii.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.iii.ii-p1.1"></span>Ep. II.</span>

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p2"></span>(Written about the same time, in reply to
another letter now lost.)

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p3"></span>I do not like being joked about Tiberina
and its mud and its winters, O my friend, who are so free from mud, and
who walk on tiptoe, and trample on the plains.  You who have wings and
are borne aloft, and fly like the arrows of Abaris, in order that,
Cappadocian though you are, you may flee from Cappadocia.  Have we done
you an injury, because while you are pale and breathing hard and
measuring the sun, we are sleek and well fed and not pressed for room? 
Yet this is your condition.  You are luxurious and rich, and go to
market.  I do not approve of this.  Either then cease to reproach us
with our mud (for you did not build your city, nor we make our winter),
or else for our mud we will bring against you your hucksters, and the
rest of the crop of nuisances which infest cities.
