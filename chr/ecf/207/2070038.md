<span id="ii.xxvi-p4"></span><span id="ii.xxvi-p4.1"></span><span
class="sc"><span id="ii.xxvi-p4.2"></span>[1 Cor. xi.
23](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#023.md)<span
id="ii.xxvi-p4.3"></span></span>

<span id="ii.xxvi-p5"></span>I received of the Lord that which also I
delivered unto you, how that the Lord Jesus, in the night in which He
was betrayed, took bread, &c.

<span id="ii.xxvi-p6"></span>1.  <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.xxvi-p6.1"></span>Even</span> of itself <span
id="fr_2444"></span>[2445](#fn_2444.md) the teaching of the Blessed Paul is
sufficient to give you a full assurance concerning those Divine
Mysteries, of which having been deemed worthy, ye are become of *the
same body* <span id="fr_2445"></span>[2446](#fn_2445.md) and blood with
Christ.  For you have just heard him say distinctly, *That our Lord
Jesus Christ in the night in which He was betrayed, took bread, and when
He had given thanks He brake it, and gave to His disciples, saying,
Take, eat, this is My Body:  and having taken the cup and given thanks,
He said, Take, drink, this is My Blood* <span
id="fr_2446"></span>[2447](#fn_2446.md) .  Since then He Himself declared
and said of the Bread, *This is My Body*, who shall dare to doubt any
longer?  And since He has Himself affirmed and said, *This is My Blood*,
who shall ever hesitate, saying, that it is not His blood?

<span id="ii.xxvi-p10"></span>2.  He once in Cana of Galilee, turned the
water into wine, akin to blood <span
id="fr_2447"></span>[2448](#fn_2447.md) , and is it incredible that He
should have turned wine into blood?  When called to a bodily marriage,
He miraculously wrought <span id="fr_2448"></span>[2449](#fn_2448.md) that
wonderful work; and *on the children of the bride-chamber* <span
id="fr_2449"></span>[2450](#fn_2449.md) , shall He not much rather be
acknowledged to have bestowed the fruition of His Body and Blood <span
id="fr_2450"></span>[2451](#fn_2450.md) ?

<span id="ii.xxvi-p17"></span>3.  Wherefore with full assurance let us
partake as of the Body and Blood of Christ:  for in the figure <span
id="fr_2451"></span>[2452](#fn_2451.md) of Bread is given to thee His Body,
and in the figure of Wine His Blood; that thou by partaking of the Body
and Blood of Christ, mayest be made of the same body and the same blood
with Him.  For thus we come to bear Christ <span
id="fr_2452"></span>[2453](#fn_2452.md) in us, because His Body and Blood
are distributed <span id="fr_2453"></span>[2454](#fn_2453.md) through our
members; thus it is that, according to the blessed Peter, *we become
partakers of the divine nature* <span
id="fr_2454"></span>[2455](#fn_2454.md) .

<span id="ii.xxvi-p22"></span>4.  Christ on a certain occasion
discoursing with the Jews said, *Except ye eat My flesh and drink My
blood, ye have no life in you* <span
id="fr_2455"></span>[2456](#fn_2455.md) .  They not having heard His saying
in a spiritual <span id="page_152">p. 152</span> <span
id="ii.xxvi-Page_152"></span>sense were offended, and went back,
supposing that He was inviting them to eat flesh.

<span id="ii.xxvi-p24"></span>5.  In the Old Testament also there was
shew-bread; but this, as it belonged to the Old Testament, has come to
an end; but in the New Testament there is Bread of heaven, and a Cup of
salvation, sanctifying soul and body; for as the Bread corresponds to
our body, so is the Word <span id="fr_2456"></span>[2457](#fn_2456.md)
appropriate to our soul.

<span id="ii.xxvi-p26"></span>6.  Consider therefore the Bread and the
Wine not as bare elements, for they are, according to the Lord’s
declaration, the Body and Blood of Christ; for even though sense
suggests this to thee, yet let faith establish thee.  Judge not the
matter from the taste, but from faith be fully assured without
misgiving, that the Body and Blood of Christ have been vouchsafed to
thee.

<span id="ii.xxvi-p27"></span>7.  Also the blessed David shall advise
thee the meaning of this, saying, *Thou hast prepared a table before me
in the presence of them that afflict me* <span
id="fr_2457"></span>[2458](#fn_2457.md) .  What he says, is to this
effect:  Before Thy coming, the evil spirits prepared a table for
men <span id="fr_2458"></span>[2459](#fn_2458.md) , polluted and defiled
and full of devilish influence <span
id="fr_2459"></span>[2460](#fn_2459.md) ; but since Thy coming. O Lord,
*Thou hast prepared a table before me*.  When the man says to God, *Thou
hast prepared before me a table*, what other does he indicate but that
mystical and spiritual Table, which God hath prepared for us *over
against*, that is, contrary and in opposition to the evil spirits?  And
very truly; for that had communion with devils, but this, with God. 
*Thou hast anointed my head with oil* <span
id="fr_2460"></span>[2461](#fn_2460.md) .  With oil He anointed thine head
upon thy forehead, for the seal which thou hast of God; that thou mayest
be made *the engraving of the signet, Holiness unto God* <span
id="fr_2461"></span>[2462](#fn_2461.md) .  And *thy cup intoxicateth me, as
very strong* <span id="fr_2462"></span>[2463](#fn_2462.md) .  Thou seest
that cup here spoken of, which Jesus took in His hands, and gave thanks,
and said, *This is My blood, which is shed for many for the remission of
sins* <span id="fr_2463"></span>[2464](#fn_2463.md) .

<span id="ii.xxvi-p35"></span>8.  Therefore Solomon also, hinting at
this grace, says in Ecclesiastes, *Come hither, eat thy bread with joy*
(that is, the spiritual bread; *Come hither*, he calls with the call to
salvation and blessing), *and drink thy wine with a merry heart* (that
is, the spiritual wine); *and let oil be poured out upon thy head* (thou
seest he alludes even to the mystic Chrism); *and let thy garments be
always white, for the Lord is well pleased with thy works* <span
id="fr_2464"></span>[2465](#fn_2464.md) ; for before thou camest to
Baptism, thy works were *vanity of vanities* <span
id="fr_2465"></span>[2466](#fn_2465.md) .  But now, having put off thy old
garments, and put on those which are spiritually white, thou must be
continually robed in white:  of course we mean not this, that thou art
always to wear white raiment; but thou must be clad in the garments that
are truly white and shining and spiritual, that thou mayest say with the
blessed Esaias, *My soul shall be joyful in my God; for He hath clothed
me with a garment of salvation, and put a robe of gladness around
me* <span id="fr_2466"></span>[2467](#fn_2466.md) .

<span id="ii.xxvi-p39"></span>9.  Having learnt these things, and been
fully assured that the seeming bread is not bread, though sensible to
taste, but the Body of Christ; and that the seeming wine is not wine,
though the taste will have it so, but the Blood of Christ <span
id="fr_2467"></span>[2468](#fn_2467.md) ; and that of this David sung of
old, saying, *And bread strengtheneth man’s heart, to make his face to
shine with oil* <span id="fr_2468"></span>[2469](#fn_2468.md) , “strengthen
thou thine heart,” by partaking thereof as spiritual, and “make the face
of thy soul to shine.”  And so having it unveiled with a pure
conscience, mayest thou *reflect as a mirror the glory of the
Lord* <span id="fr_2469"></span>[2470](#fn_2469.md) , and proceed from
*glory to glory*, in Christ Jesus our Lord:—To whom be honour, and
might, and glory, for ever and ever.  Amen.

<span id="ii.xxvi-p8"></span> Introduction, “*Eucharist*.”  The word
<span class="Greek"><span id="ii.xxvi-p8.1"></span>σύσσωμοι</span> has a
different sense in [Eph. iii. 6](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#006.md)<span
id="ii.xxvi-p8.2"></span>, where it is applied to the Gentiles as having
been made members of Christ’s body the Church.

<span id="ii.xxvi-p9"></span> [1 Cor. xi.
23](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#023.md)<span id="ii.xxvi-p9.1"></span>. 
The clause “and gave to His disciples” is an addition taken from [Matt.
xxvi. 26](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#026.md)<span
id="ii.xxvi-p9.2"></span>.  The part relating to the cup does not
correspond exactly either with St. Paul’s language or with the
Evangelists’.

<span id="ii.xxvi-p12"></span>The reading <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.xxvi-p12.1"></span>οἰκείῳ νεύματι</span>, “by His own will,”
introduces a superfluous thought, and destroys the very point of Cyril’s
argument, in which the previous change of water into an element so
different as wine is regarded as giving an *a fortiori* probability to
the change of that which is already “akin to blood” into blood itself.

<span id="ii.xxvi-p13"></span>If Cyril thus seems to teach a physical
change of the wine, it must be remembered that we are not bound to
accept his view, but only to state it accurately.  See however the
section of the Introduction on his Eucharistic doctrine.

<span id="ii.xxvi-p16"></span> Ben. Ed.:  “That the force of Cyril’s
argument may be the better understood, we must observe that in Baptism
is celebrated the marriage of Christ with the Christian soul; and that
the consummation of this marriage is perfected through the union of
bodies in the mystery of the Eucharist.  Read Chrysostom’s *Hom*. xx.
*in Ephes*.”  Chrysostom’s words are:  “In like manner therefore we
become one flesh with Christ by participation (<span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.xxvi-p16.1"></span>μετουσίας</span>).”  But the participation
expressed by <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.xxvi-p16.2"></span>μετουσία</span> does not necessarily refer to
the Eucharist.  From the use of the word in Cat. xxiii. 11, and in
Athanasius (*Contra Arianos, Or*. i.; *de Synodis*. 19, 22, 25) the
meaning rather seems to be that we are one flesh with Christ not by
nature but by His gift.

<span id="ii.xxvi-p25"></span> Ben. Ed.:  “Here we are to understand (by
<span class="Greek"><span id="ii.xxvi-p25.1"></span>ὁ</span> <span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.xxvi-p25.2"></span>Λόγος</span>) the Divine
Word, not the bare discourse of God, but the second Person of the Holy
Trinity, Christ Himself, the Bread of Heaven, as He testifies of
Himself, [John vi. 51](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#051.md)<span
id="ii.xxvi-p25.3"></span>:  Him Cyril contrasts with the earthly
shew-bread in the O.T.; otherwise he could not rightly from this
sentence infer, by the particle <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.xxvi-p25.4"></span>οὖν</span>, “therefore,” that the Eucharist is
truly the Body and Blood of Christ.  And since he says, in Cat. xxiii.
15, that the Eucharistic food is “appointed for the substance of the
soul,” for its benefit, that cannot be said of Christ’s body or of His
soul, but only of the Word which is conjoined with both.  Moreover that
the Divine Word is the food of Angels and of the soul, is a common mode
of speaking with all the Fathers.  They often play on the ambiguity of
this word (<span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.xxvi-p25.5"></span>λόγος</span>), saying sometimes that the
Divine Word, sometimes the word and oracles of God, are the food of our
souls:  both statements are true.  For the whole life-giving power of
the Eucharist is derived from the Word of God united to the flesh which
He assumed:  and the whole benefit of Eucharistic eating consists in the
union of our soul with the Word, in meditation on His mysteries and
sayings, and conformity thereto.”
