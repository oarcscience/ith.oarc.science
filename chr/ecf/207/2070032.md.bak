id="ii.xx-p2.1"></span>On the Article, And in One Holy Ghost, the
Comforter, Which Spake in the Prophets.</span>

<span id="ii.xx-p3"></span><span id="ii.xx-p3.1"></span><span
class="sc"><span id="ii.xx-p3.2"></span>[1 Cor.
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#001.md),

<span id="ii.xx-p4"></span>Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I
would not have you ignorant.…Now there are diversities of gifts, but the
same Spirit, &c.

<span id="ii.xx-p5"></span>1.  <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.xx-p5.1"></span>Spiritual</span> in truth is the grace we need,
in order to discourse concerning the Holy Spirit; not that we may speak
what is worthy of Him, for this is impossible, but that by speaking the
words of the divine Scriptures, we may run our course without danger. 
For a truly fearful thing is written in the Gospels, where Christ has
plainly said, *Whosoever shall speak a word against the Holy Ghost, it
shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, nor in that which is
to come* <span id="fr_1969"></span>[1970](#fn_1969.md) .  And there is
often fear, lest a man should receive this condemnation, through
speaking what he ought not concerning Him, either from ignorance, or
from supposed reverence.  The Judge of quick and dead, Jesus Christ,
declared that he hath no forgiveness; if therefore any man offend, what
hope has he?

<span id="ii.xx-p7"></span>2.  It must therefore belong to Jesus
Christ’s grace itself to grant both to us to speak without deficiency,
and to you to hear with discretion; for discretion is needful not to
them only who speak, but also to them that hear, lest they hear one
thing, and misconceive another in their mind.  Let us then speak
concerning the Holy Ghost nothing but what is written; and whatsoever is
not written, let us not busy ourselves about it.  The Holy Ghost Himself
spoke the Scriptures; He has also spoken concerning Himself as much as
He pleased, or as much as we could receive.  Let us therefore speak
those things which He has said; for whatsoever He has not said, we dare
not say.

<span id="ii.xx-p8"></span>3.  There is One Only Holy Ghost, the
Comforter; and as there is One God the Father, and no second Father;—and
as there is One Only-begotten Son and Word of God, who hath no
brother;—so is there One Only Holy Ghost, and no second spirit equal
in-honour to Him.  Now the Holy Ghost is a Power most mighty, a Being
divine and unsearchable; for He is living and intelligent, a sanctifying
principle of all things made by God through Christ.  He it is who
illuminates the souls of the just; He was in the Prophets, He was also
in the Apostles in the New Testament.  Abhorred be they who dare to
separate the operation of the Holy Ghost!  There is One God, the Father,
Lord of the Old and of the New Testament:  and One Lord, Jesus Christ,
who was prophesied of in the Old Testament, and came in the New; and One
Holy Ghost, who through the Prophets preached of Christ, and when Christ
was come, descended, and manifested Him <span
id="fr_1970"></span>[1971](#fn_1970.md) .

<span id="ii.xx-p12"></span><span id="page_116">p. 116</span> <span
id="ii.xx-Page_116"></span>4.  Let no one therefore separate the Old
from the New Testament <span id="fr_1971"></span>[1972](#fn_1971.md) ; let
no one say that the Spirit in the former is one, and in the latter
another; since thus he offends against the Holy Ghost Himself, who with
the Father and the Son together is honoured, and at the time of Holy
Baptism is included with them in the Holy Trinity.  For the
Only-begotten Son of God said plainly to the Apostles, *Go ye, and make
disciples of all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost* <span
id="fr_1972"></span>[1973](#fn_1972.md) .  Our hope is in Father, and Son,
and Holy Ghost.  We preach not three Gods <span
id="fr_1973"></span>[1974](#fn_1973.md) ; let the Marcionites be silenced;
but with the Holy Ghost through One Son, we preach One God.  The Faith
is indivisible; the worship inseparable.  We neither separate the Holy
Trinity, like some; nor do we as Sabellius work confusion. <span
id="fr_1974"></span>[1975](#fn_1974.md)   But we know according to
godliness One Father, who sent His Son to be our Saviour; we know One
Son, who promised that He would send the Comforter from the Father; we
know the Holy Ghost, who spake in the Prophets, and who on the day of
Pentecost descended on the Apostles in the form of fiery tongues, here,
in Jerusalem, in the Upper Church of the Apostles <span
id="fr_1975"></span>[1976](#fn_1975.md) ; for in all things the choicest
privileges are with us.  Here Christ came down from heaven; here the
Holy Ghost came down from heaven.  And in truth it were most fitting,
that as we discourse concerning Christ and Golgotha here in Golgotha, so
also we should speak concerning the Holy Ghost in the Upper Church; yet
since He who descended there jointly partakes of the glory of Him who
was crucified here, we here speak concerning Him also who descended
there:  for their worship is indivisible.

<span id="ii.xx-p18"></span>5.  We would now say somewhat concerning the
Holy Ghost; not to declare His substance with exactness, for this were
impossible; but to speak of the diverse mistakes of some concerning him,
lest from ignorance we should fall into them; and to block up the paths
of error, that we may journey on the King’s one highway.  And if we now
for caution’s sake repeat any statement of the heretics, let it recoil
on their heads, and may we be guiltless, both we who speak, and ye who
hear.

<span id="ii.xx-p19"></span>6.  For the heretics, who are most profane
in all things, have *sharpened their tongue* <span
id="fr_1976"></span>[1977](#fn_1976.md) against the Holy Ghost also, and
have dared to utter impious things; as Irenæus the interpreter has
written in his injunctions against heresies <span
id="fr_1977"></span>[1978](#fn_1977.md) .  For some of them have dared to
say that they were themselves the Holy Ghost;—of whom the first was
Simon <span id="fr_1978"></span>[1979](#fn_1978.md) , the sorcerer spoken
of in the Acts of the Apostles; for when he was cast out, he presumed to
teach such doctrines:  and they who are called Gnostics, impious men,
have spoken other things against the Spirit <span
id="fr_1979"></span>[1980](#fn_1979.md) , and the wicked Valentinians <span
id="fr_1980"></span>[1981](#fn_1980.md) again something else; and the
profane Manes dared to call himself the Paraclete sent by Christ <span
id="fr_1981"></span>[1982](#fn_1981.md) .  Others again have taught that
the Spirit is different in the Prophets and in the New Testament. <span
id="fr_1982"></span>[1983](#fn_1982.md)   Yea, and great is their error, or
rather their blasphemy.  Such therefore abhor, and flee from them who
blaspheme the Holy Ghost, and have no forgiveness.  For what fellowship
hast thou with the desperate, thou, who art now to be baptized, into the
Holy Ghost also <span id="fr_1983"></span>[1984](#fn_1983.md) ?  If he who
attaches himself to a thief, and consenteth with him, is subject to
punishment, what hope shall he have, who offends against the Holy Ghost?

<span id="ii.xx-p28"></span>7.  Let the Marcionists also be abhorred,
who tear away from the New Testament the sayings of the Old <span
id="fr_1984"></span>[1985](#fn_1984.md) .  For Marcion first, that most
impious of men, who first asserted three Gods <span
id="fr_1985"></span>[1986](#fn_1985.md) , knowing that in the New Testament
are <span id="page_117">p. 117</span> <span
id="ii.xx-Page_117"></span>contained testimonies of the Prophets
concerning Christ, cut out the testimonies taken from the Old Testament,
that the King might be left without witness.  Abhor those
above-mentioned Gnostics, men of knowledge by name, but fraught with
ignorance; who have dared to say such things of the Holy Ghost as I dare
not repeat.

<span id="ii.xx-p31"></span>8.  Let the Cataphrygians <span
id="fr_1986"></span>[1987](#fn_1986.md) also be thy abhorrence, and
Montanus, their ringleader in evil, and his two so-called prophetesses,
Maximilla and Priscilla.  For this Montanus, who was out of his mind and
really mad (for he would not have said such things, had he not been
mad), dared to say that he was himself the Holy Ghost,—he, miserable
man, and filled with all uncleanness and lasciviousness; for it suffices
but to hint at this, out of respect for the women who are present.  And
having taken possession of Pepuza, a very small hamlet of Phrygia, he
falsely named it Jerusalem; and cutting the throats of wretched little
children, and chopping them up into unholy food, for the purpose of
their so-called mysteries <span id="fr_1987"></span>[1988](#fn_1987.md)
,—(wherefore till but lately in the time of persecution we were
suspected of doing this, because these Montanists were called, falsely
indeed, by the common name of Christians;)—yet he dared to call himself
the Holy Ghost, filled as he was with all impiety and inhuman cruelty,
and condemned by an irrevocable sentence.

<span id="ii.xx-p34"></span>9.  And he was seconded, as was said before,
by that most impious Manes also, who combined what was bad in every
heresy <span id="fr_1988"></span>[1989](#fn_1988.md) ; who being the very
lowest pit of destruction, collected the doctrines of all the heretics,
and wrought out and taught a yet more novel error, and dared to say that
he himself was the Comforter, whom Christ promised to send.  But the
Saviour when He promised Him, said to the Apostles, *But tarry ye in the
city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high* <span
id="fr_1989"></span>[1990](#fn_1989.md) .  What then? did the Apostles who
had been dead two hundred years, wait for Manes, *until they should be
endued with the power*; and will any dare to say, that they were not
forthwith full of the Holy Ghost?  Moreover it is written, *Then they
laid their hands on and they received the Holy Ghost* <span
id="fr_1990"></span>[1991](#fn_1990.md) ; was not this before Manes, yea,
many years before, when the Holy Ghost descended on the day of
Pentecost?

<span id="ii.xx-p38"></span>10.  Wherefore was Simon the sorcerer
condemned?  Was it not that he came to the Apostles, and said, *Give me
also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy
Ghost*?  For he said not, “Give me also the fellowship of the Holy
Ghost,” but “Give me the power;” that he might sell to others that which
could not be sold, and which he did not himself possess.  He offered
money also to them who had no possessions <span
id="fr_1991"></span>[1992](#fn_1991.md) ; and this, though he saw men
bringing the prices of the things sold, and laying them at the Apostles’
feet.  And he considered not that they who trod under foot the wealth
which was brought for the maintenance of the poor, were not likely to
give the power of the Holy Ghost for a bribe.  But what say they to
Simon?  *Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought to
purchase the gift of God with money* <span
id="fr_1992"></span>[1993](#fn_1992.md) ; for thou art a second Judas, for
expecting to buy the grace of the Spirit with money.  If then Simon, for
wishing to get this power for a price, is to *perish*, how great is the
impiety of Manes, who said that he was the Holy Ghost?  Let us hate them
who are worthy of hatred; let us turn away from them from whom God turns
away; let us also ourselves say unto God with all boldness concerning
all heretics, *Do not I hate them, O Lord, that hate Thee, and am not I
grieved with Thine enemies* <span id="fr_1993"></span>[1994](#fn_1993.md)
?  For there is also an enmity which is right, according as it is
written, *I will put enmity between thee and her seed* <span
id="fr_1994"></span>[1995](#fn_1994.md) ; for friendship with the serpent
works enmity with God, and death.

<span id="ii.xx-p43"></span>11.  Let then thus much suffice concerning
those outcasts; and now let us return to the divine Scriptures, and let
us *drink waters out of our own cisterns* \[that is, the holy
Fathers <span id="fr_1995"></span>[1996](#fn_1995.md) \], *and out of our
own springing wells* <span id="fr_1996"></span>[1997](#fn_1996.md) .  Drink
we of *living water, springing up into everlasting life* <span
id="fr_1997"></span>[1998](#fn_1997.md) ; *but this spake* the Saviour *of
the Spirit, which they that believe on Him should receive* <span
id="fr_1998"></span>[1999](#fn_1998.md) .  For observe what He says, *He
that believeth on Me* (not simply this, but), *as the Scripture hath
said* (thus He hath sent thee back to the Old Testament), *out of his
belly shall flow rivers of living water*, not rivers perceived by sense,
and merely watering the earth with its thorns and trees, but bringing
souls to the light.  And in another place He says, *But the water that I
shall give him, shall be in him a well of living water springing up*
<span id="page_118">p. 118</span> <span id="ii.xx-Page_118"></span>*into
everlasting life*,—a new kind of water living and springing up,
springing up unto them who are worthy.

<span id="ii.xx-p48"></span>12.  And why did He call the grace of the
Spirit water?  Because by water all things subsist; because water brings
forth grass and living things; because the water of the showers comes
down from heaven; because it comes down one in form, but works in many
forms.  For one fountain watereth the whole of Paradise, and one and the
same rain comes down upon all the world, yet it becomes white in the
lily, and red in the rose, and purple in violets and hyacinths, and
different and varied in each several kind:  so it is one in the
palm-tree, and another in the vine, and all in all things; and yet is
one in nature, not diverse from itself; for the rain does not change
itself, and come down first as one thing, then as another, but adapting
itself to the constitution of each thing which receives it, it becomes
to each what is suitable <span id="fr_1999"></span>[2000](#fn_1999.md) . 
Thus also the Holy Ghost, being one, and of one nature, and indivisible,
divides to each His grace, *according as He will* <span
id="fr_2000"></span>[2001](#fn_2000.md) :  and as the dry tree, after
partaking of water, puts forth shoots, so also the soul in sin, when it
has been through repentance made worthy of the Holy Ghost, brings forth
clusters of righteousness.  And though He is One in nature, yet many are
the virtues which by the will of God and in the Name of Christ He
works.  For He employs the tongue of one man for wisdom; the soul of
another He enlightens by Prophecy; to another He gives power to drive
away devils; to another He gives to interpret the divine Scriptures.  He
strengthens one man’s self-command; He teaches another the way to give
alms; another He teaches to fast and discipline himself; another He
teaches to despise the things of the body; another He trains for
martyrdom:  diverse in different men, yet not diverse from Himself, as
it is written, *But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every
man to profit withal.  For to one is given through the Spirit the word
of wisdom; and to another the word of knowledge according to the same
Spirit; to another faith, in the same Spirit; and to another gifts of
healing, in the same Spirit; and to another workings of miracles; and to
another prophecy; and to another discernings of spirits; and to another
divers kinds of tongues; and to another the interpretation of tongues: 
but all these worketh that one and the same Spirit, dividing to every
man severally as He will* <span id="fr_2001"></span>[2002](#fn_2001.md) .

<span id="ii.xx-p52"></span>13.  But since concerning spirit in general
many diverse things are written in the divine Scriptures, and there is
fear lest some out of ignorance fall into confusion, not knowing to what
sort of spirit the writing refers; it will be well now to certify you,
of what kind the Scripture declares the Holy Spirit to be.  For as Aaron
is called Christ, and David and Saul and others are called Christs <span
id="fr_2002"></span>[2003](#fn_2002.md) , but there is only one true
Christ, so likewise since the name of spirit is given to different
things, it is right to see what is that which is distinctively called
the Holy Spirit.  For many things are called spirits.  Thus an Angel is
called spirit, our soul is called spirit, and this wind which is blowing
is called spirit; great virtue also is spoken of as spirit; and impure
practice is called spirit; and a devil our adversary is called spirit. 
Beware therefore when thou hearest these things, lest from their having
a common name thou mistake one for another.  For concerning our soul the
Scripture says, *His spirit shall go forth, and he shall return to his
earth* <span id="fr_2003"></span>[2004](#fn_2003.md) :  and of the same
soul it says again, *Which formeth the spirit of man within him* <span
id="fr_2004"></span>[2005](#fn_2004.md) .  And of the Angels it is said in
the Psalms, *Who maketh His Angels spirits, and His ministers a flame of
fire* <span id="fr_2005"></span>[2006](#fn_2005.md) .  And of the wind it
saith, *Thou shalt break the ships of Tarshish with a violent
spirit* <span id="fr_2006"></span>[2007](#fn_2006.md) ; and, *As the tree
in the wood is shaken by the spirit* <span
id="fr_2007"></span>[2008](#fn_2007.md) ; and, *Fire, hail, snow, ice,
spirit of storm* <span id="fr_2008"></span>[2009](#fn_2008.md) .  And of
good doctrine the Lord Himself says, *The words that I have spoken unto
you, they are spirit* <span id="fr_2009"></span>[2010](#fn_2009.md) , *and
they are life*; instead of, “are spiritual.”  But the Holy Spirit is not
pronounced by the tongue; but He is a Living Spirit, who gives wisdom of
speech, Himself speaking and discoursing.

<span id="ii.xx-p61"></span>14.  And wouldest thou know that He
discourses and speaks?  Philip by revelation of an Angel went down to
the way which leads to Gaza, when the Eunuch was coming; and the Spirit
said to Philip, *Go near, and join thyself to this chariot* <span
id="fr_2010"></span>[2011](#fn_2010.md) .  Seest thou the Spirit talking to
one who hears Him?  Ezekiel also speaks thus, *The Spirit of the Lord
came upon me, and said unto me, Thus saith the Lord* <span
id="fr_2011"></span>[2012](#fn_2011.md) .  And again, *The Holy Ghost
said <span id="fr_2012"></span>[2013](#fn_2012.md)* , unto the Apostles who
were in Antioch, *Separate me now Barnabas and Saul for the work
whereunto I have called them*.  Beholdest thou the Spirit living,
separating, calling, and with authority sending forth?  Paul also said,
*Save that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city, saying that bonds
and afflictions await me* <span id="fr_2013"></span>[2014](#fn_2013.md) . 
For this good Sanctifier of the Church, and her Helper, and Teacher, the
Holy Ghost, the Comforter, of whom the Saviour said, *He shall* <span
id="page_119">p. 119</span> <span id="ii.xx-Page_119"></span>*teach you
all things* (and He said not only, *He shall teach*, but also, *He shall
bring to your remembrance whatever I have said unto you* <span
id="fr_2014"></span>[2015](#fn_2014.md) ; for the teachings of Christ and
of the Holy Ghost are not different, but the same)—He, I say, testified
before to Paul what things should befall him, that he might be the more
stout-hearted, from knowing them beforehand.  Now I have spoken these
things unto you because of the text, *The words which I have spoken unto
you, they are spirit*; that thou mayest understand this, not of the
utterance of the lips <span id="fr_2015"></span>[2016](#fn_2015.md) , but
of the good doctrine in this passage.

<span id="ii.xx-p68"></span>15.  But sin also is called spirit, as I
have already said; only in another and opposite sense, as when it is
said, *The spirit of whoredom caused them to err* <span
id="fr_2016"></span>[2017](#fn_2016.md) .  The name “spirit” is given also
to the *unclean spirit*, the devil; but with the addition of, “the
unclean;” for to each is joined its distinguishing name, to mark its
proper nature.  If the Scripture speak of the soul of man, it says *the
spirit* with the addition, *of the man*; if it mean the wind, it says,
*spirit of storm*; if sin, it says, *spirit of whoredom*; if the devil,
it says, *an unclean spirit*:  that we may know which particular thing
is spoken of, and thou mayest not suppose that it means the Holy Ghost;
God forbid!  For this name of spirit is common to many things; and every
thing which has not a solid body is in a general way called spirit <span
id="fr_2017"></span>[2018](#fn_2017.md) .  Since, therefore, the devils
have not such bodies, they are called spirits:  but there is a great
difference; for the unclean devil, when he comes upon a man’s soul (may
the Lord deliver from him every soul of those who hear me, and of those
who are not present), he comes like a wolf upon a sheep, ravening for
blood, and ready to devour.  His coming is most fierce; the sense of it
most oppressive; the mind becomes darkened; his attack is an injustice
also, and so is his usurpation of another’s possession.  For he makes
forcible use of another’s body, and another’s instruments, as if they
were his own; he throws down him who stands upright (for he is akin to
him who *fell from heaven* <span id="fr_2018"></span>[2019](#fn_2018) .md);
he twists the tongue and distorts the lips; foam comes instead of words;
the man is filled with darkness; his eye is open, yet the soul sees not
through it; and the miserable man gasps convulsively at the point of
death.  The devils are verily foes of men, using them foully and
mercilessly.

<span id="ii.xx-p72"></span>16.  Such is not the Holy Ghost; God
forbid!  For His doings tend the contrary way, towards what is good and
salutary.  First, His coming is gentle; the perception of Him is
fragrant; His burden most light; beams of light and knowledge gleam
forth before His coming <span id="fr_2019"></span>[2020](#fn_2019.md) .  He
comes with the bowels of a true guardian:  for He comes to save, and to
heal, to teach, to admonish, to strengthen, to exhort, to enlighten the
mind, first of him who receives Him, and afterwards of others also,
through him.  And as a man, who being previously in darkness then
suddenly beholds the sun, is enlightened in his bodily sight, and sees
plainly things which he saw not, so likewise he to whom the Holy Ghost
is vouchsafed, is enlightened in his soul, and sees things beyond man’s
sight, which he knew not; his body is on earth, yet his soul mirrors
forth the heavens.  He sees, like Esaias, *the Lord sitting upon a
throne high and lifted up* <span id="fr_2020"></span>[2021](#fn_2020.md) ;
he sees, like Ezekiel, *Him who is above the Cherubim* <span
id="fr_2021"></span>[2022](#fn_2021.md) ; he sees like Daniel, *ten
thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands* <span
id="fr_2022"></span>[2023](#fn_2022.md) ; and the man, who is so little,
beholds the beginning of the world, and knows the end of the world, and
the times intervening, and the successions of kings,—things which he
never learned:  for the True Enlightener is present with him.  The man
is within the walls of a house; yet the power of his knowledge reaches
far and wide, and he sees even what other men are doing.

<span id="ii.xx-p77"></span>17.  Peter was not with Ananias and Sapphira
when they sold their possessions, but he was present by the Spirit;
*Why*, he says, *hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy
Ghost* <span id="fr_2023"></span>[2024](#fn_2023.md) ?  There was no
accuser; there was no witness; whence knew he what had happened? 
*Whiles it remained was it not thine own? and after it was sold, was it
not in thine own power? why hast thou conceived this thing in thine
heart* <span id="fr_2024"></span>[2025](#fn_2024.md) ?  The
*unlettered <span id="fr_2025"></span>[2026](#fn_2025.md)* Peter, through
the grace of the Spirit, learnt what not even the wise men of the Greeks
had known.  Thou hast the like in the case also of Elisseus.  For when
he had freely healed the leprosy of Naaman, Gehazi received the reward,
the reward of another’s achievement; and he took the money from Naaman,
and bestowed it in a dark place.  But the *darkness is not* hidden from
the Saints <span id="fr_2026"></span>[2027](#fn_2026.md) .  And when he
came, Elisseus asked him; and like Peter, when he said, *Tell me whether
ye* <span id="page_120">p. 120</span> <span
id="ii.xx-Page_120"></span>*sold the land for so much* <span
id="fr_2027"></span>[2028](#fn_2027.md) ? he also enquires, *Whence comest
thou, Gehazi* <span id="fr_2028"></span>[2029](#fn_2028.md) ?  Not in
ignorance, but in sorrow ask I *whence comest thou*?  From darkness art
thou come, and to darkness shalt thou go; thou hast sold the cure of the
leper, and the leprosy is thy heritage.  I, he says, have fulfilled the
bidding of Him who said to me, *Freely ye have received, freely
give* <span id="fr_2029"></span>[2030](#fn_2029.md) ; but thou hast sold
this grace; receive now the condition of the sale.  But what says
Elisseus to him?  *Went not mine heart with thee*?  I was here shut in
by the body, but the spirit which has been given me of God saw even the
things afar off, and shewed me plainly what was doing elsewhere.  Seest
thou how the Holy Ghost not only rids of ignorance, but invests with
knowledge?  Seest thou how He enlightens men’s souls?

<span id="ii.xx-p85"></span>18.  Esaias lived nearly a thousand years
ago; and he beheld Zion *as a booth*.  The city was still standing, and
beautified with public places, and robed in majesty; yet he says, *Zion
shall be ploughed as a field* <span id="fr_2030"></span>[2031](#fn_2030.md)
, foretelling what is now fulfilled in our days <span
id="fr_2031"></span>[2032](#fn_2031.md) .  And observe the exactness of the
prophecy; for he said, *And the daughter of Zion shall be left as a
booth in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers* <span
id="fr_2032"></span>[2033](#fn_2032.md) .  And now the place is filled with
gardens of cucumbers.  Seest thou how the Holy Spirit enlightens the
saints?  Be not therefore carried away to other things, by the force of
a common term, but keep fast the exact meaning.

<span id="ii.xx-p89"></span>19.  And if ever, while thou hast been
sitting here, a thought concerning chastity or virginity has come into
thy mind, it has been His teaching.  Has not often a maiden, already at
the bridal threshold <span id="fr_2033"></span>[2034](#fn_2033.md) , fled
away, He teaching her the doctrine of virginity?  Has not often a man
distinguished at court <span id="fr_2034"></span>[2035](#fn_2034.md) ,
scorned wealth and rank, under the teaching of the Holy Ghost?  Has not
often a young man, at the sight of beauty, closed his eyes, and fled
from the sight, and escaped the defilement?  Askest thou whence this has
come to pass?  The Holy Ghost taught the soul of the young man.  Many
ways of covetousness are there in the world; yet Christians refuse
possessions:  wherefore? because of the teaching of the Holy Ghost. 
Worthy of honour is in truth that Spirit, holy and good; and fittingly
are we baptized into Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.  A man, still clothed
with a body, wrestles with many fiercest demons; and often the demon,
whom many men could not master with iron bands, has been mastered by the
man himself with words of prayer, through the power which is in him of
the Holy Ghost; and the mere breathing of the Exorcist <span
id="fr_2035"></span>[2036](#fn_2035.md) becomes as fire to that unseen
foe.  A mighty ally and protector, therefore, have we from God; a great
Teacher of the Church, a mighty Champion on our behalf.  Let us not be
afraid of the demons, nor of the devil; for mightier is He who fighteth
for us.  Only let us open to Him our doors; *for He goeth about seeking
such as are worthy* <span id="fr_2036"></span>[2037](#fn_2036.md) and
searching on whom He may confer His gifts.

<span id="ii.xx-p94"></span>20.  And He is called the Comforter, because
He comforts and encourages us, and *helpeth our infirmities; for we know
not what we should pray for as we ought; but the Spirit Himself maketh
intercession for us, with groanings which cannot be uttered* <span
id="fr_2037"></span>[2038](#fn_2037.md) , that is, makes intercession to
God.  Oftentimes a man for Christ’s sake has been outraged and
dishonoured unjustly; martyrdom is at hand; tortures on every side, and
fire, and sword, and savage beasts, and the pit.  But the Holy Ghost
softly whispers to him, “*Wait thou on the Lord* <span
id="fr_2038"></span>[2039](#fn_2038.md) , O man; what is now befalling thee
is a small matter, the reward will be great.  Suffer a little while, and
thou shalt be with Angels for ever.  *The sufferings of this present
time art not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be
revealed in us* <span id="fr_2039"></span>[2040](#fn_2039.md) .”  He
portrays to the man the kingdom of heaven; He gives him a glimpse of the
paradise of delight; and the martyrs, whose bodily countenances are of
necessity turned to their judges, but who in spirit are already in
Paradise, despise those hardships which are seen.

<span id="ii.xx-p98"></span>21.  And wouldest thou be sure that by the
power of the Holy Ghost the Martyrs bear their witness?  The Saviour
says to His disciples, *And when they bring you unto* <span
id="page_121">p. 121</span> <span id="ii.xx-Page_121"></span>*the
synagogues, and the magistrates, and authorities, be not anxious how ye
shall answer, or what ye shall say; for the Holy Ghost shall teach you
in that very hour, what ye ought to say* <span
id="fr_2040"></span>[2041](#fn_2040.md) .  For it is impossible to testify
as a martyr for Christ’s sake, except a man testify by the Holy Ghost;
for if *no man can say that Jesus Christ is the Lord, but by the Holy
Ghost* <span id="fr_2041"></span>[2042](#fn_2041.md) , how shall any man
give his own life for Jesus’ sake, but by the Holy Ghost?

<span id="ii.xx-p101"></span>22.  Great indeed, and all-powerful in
gifts, and wonderful, is the Holy Ghost.  Consider, how many of you are
now sitting here, how many souls of us are present.  He is working
suitably for each, and being present in the midst, beholds the temper of
each, beholds also his reasoning and his conscience, and what we say,
and think, and believe <span id="fr_2042"></span>[2043](#fn_2042.md) . 
Great indeed is what I have now said, and yet is it small.  For
consider, I pray, with mind enlightened by Him, how many Christians
there are in all this diocese, and how many in the whole province <span
id="fr_2043"></span>[2044](#fn_2043.md) of Palestine, and carry forward thy
mind from this province, to the whole Roman Empire; and after this,
consider the whole world; races of Persians, and nations of Indians,
Garbs and Sarmatians, Gauls and Spaniards, and Moors, Libyans and
Ethiopians, and the rest for whom we have no names; for of many of the
nations not even the names have reached us.  Consider, I pray, of each
nation, Bishops, Presbyters, Deacons, Solitaries, Virgins, and laity
besides; and then behold their great Protector, and the Dispenser of
their gifts;—how throughout the world He gives to one chastity, to
another perpetual virginity, to another almsgiving, to another voluntary
poverty, to another power of repelling hostile spirits.  And as the
light, with one touch of its radiance sheds brightness on all things, so
also the Holy Ghost enlightens those who have eyes; for if any from
blindness is not vouchsafed His grace, let him not blame the Spirit, but
his own unbelief.

<span id="ii.xx-p104"></span>23.  Thou hast seen His power, which is in
all the world; tarry now no longer upon earth, but ascend on high. 
Ascend, I say, in imagination even unto the first heaven, and behold
there so many countless myriads of Angels.  Mount up in thy thoughts, if
thou canst, yet higher; consider, I pray thee, the Archangels, consider
also the Spirits; consider the Virtues, consider the Principalities,
consider the Powers, consider the Thrones, consider the Dominions <span
id="fr_2044"></span>[2045](#fn_2044.md) ;—of all these the Comforter is the
Ruler from God, and the Teacher, and the Sanctifier.  Of Him Elias has
need, and Elisseus, and Esaias, among men; of Him Michael and Gabriel
have need among Angels.  Naught of things created is equal in honour to
Him:  for the families of the Angels, and all their hosts assembled
together, have no equality with the Holy Ghost.  All these the
all-excellent power of the Comforter overshadows.  And they indeed are
sent forth to minister <span id="fr_2045"></span>[2046](#fn_2045.md) , but
He searches even the deep things of God, according as the Apostle says,
For the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.  For
what man knoweth the thing of a man, save the spirit of the man which is
in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of
God <span id="fr_2046"></span>[2047](#fn_2046.md) .

<span id="ii.xx-p108"></span>24.  He preached concerning Christ in the
Prophets; He wrought in the Apostles; He to this day seals the souls in
Baptism.  And the Father indeed gives to the Son; and the Son shares
with the Holy Ghost.  For it is Jesus Himself, not I, who says, *All
things are delivered unto Me of My Father* <span
id="fr_2047"></span>[2048](#fn_2047.md) ; and of the Holy Ghost He says,
*When He, the Spirit of Truth, shall come*, and the rest.…*He shall
glorify Me; for He shall receive of Mine, and shall shew it unto
you* <span id="fr_2048"></span>[2049](#fn_2048.md) .  The Father through
the Son, with the Holy Ghost, is the giver of all grace; the gifts of
the Father are none other than those of the Son, and those of the Holy
Ghost; for there is one Salvation, one Power, one Faith; One God, the
Father; One Lord, His only-begotten Son; One Holy Ghost, the Comforter. 
And it is enough for us to know these things; but inquire not curiously
into His nature or substance <span id="fr_2049"></span>[2050](#fn_2049.md)
:  for had it been written, we would have spoken of it; what is not
written, let us not venture on; it is sufficient for our salvation to
know, that there is Father, and Son, and Holy Ghost.

<span id="ii.xx-p112"></span>25.  This Spirit descended upon the seventy
Elders in the days of Moses.  (Now let not the length of the discourse,
beloved, produce weariness in you:  but may He the very subject of our
discourse grant strength to every one, both to us who speak, and to you
who listen!)  This Spirit, as I was saying, came down upon the seventy
Elders in the time of Moses; and this I say to thee, that I may now
prove, that He knoweth all things, and worketh *as He will* <span
id="fr_2050"></span>[2051](#fn_2050.md) .   <span id="page_122">p.
122</span> <span id="ii.xx-Page_122"></span>The seventy Elders were
chosen; *And the Lord came down in a cloud, and took of the Spirit that
was upon Moses, and put it upon the seventy Elders* <span
id="fr_2051"></span>[2052](#fn_2051.md) ; not that the Spirit was divided,
but that His grace was distributed in proportion to the vessels, and the
capacity of the recipients.  Now there were present sixty and eight, and
they prophesied; but Eldad and Modad were not present:  therefore that
it might be shewn that it was not Moses who bestowed the gift, but the
Spirit who wrought, Eldad and Modad, who though called, had not as yet
presented themselves, did also prophesy <span
id="fr_2052"></span>[2053](#fn_2052.md) .

<span id="ii.xx-p116"></span>26.  Jesus the Son of Nun, the successor of
Moses, was amazed; and came to him and said, “Hast thou heard that Eldad
and Modad are prophesying?  They were called, and they came not; *my
lord Moses, forbid them* <span id="fr_2053"></span>[2054](#fn_2053.md) .” 
“I cannot forbid them,” he says, “for this grace is from Heaven; nay, so
far am I from forbidding them, that I myself am thankful for it.  I
think not, however, that thou hast said this in envy; *art* thou
*jealous for my sake*, because that they prophesy, and thou prophesiest
not yet?  Wait for the proper season; *and oh that all the Lord’s people
may be prophets, whenever the Lord shall give His Spirit upon
them* <span id="fr_2054"></span>[2055](#fn_2054.md) !” saying this also
prophetically, *whenever the Lord shall give*; “For as yet then He has
not given it; so thou hast it not yet.”—Had not then Abraham this, and
Isaac, and Jacob, and Joseph?  And they of old, had they it not?  Nay,
but the words, “*whenever the Lord shall give*” evidently mean “give it
upon all; as yet indeed the grace is partial, then it shall be given
lavishly.”  And he secretly alluded to what was to happen among us on
the day of Pentecost; for He Himself came down among us.  He had however
also come down upon many before.  For it is written, *And Jesus the son
of Nun was filled with a spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands
upon him* <span id="fr_2055"></span>[2056](#fn_2055.md) .  Thou seest the
figure everywhere the same in the Old and New Testament;—in the days of
Moses, the Spirit was given by laying on of hands; and by laying on of
hands Peter <span id="fr_2056"></span>[2057](#fn_2056.md) also gives the
Spirit.  And on thee also, who art about to be baptized, shall His grace
come; yet in what manner I say not, for I will not anticipate the proper
season.

<span id="ii.xx-p121"></span>27.  He also came down upon all righteous
men and Prophets; Enos, I mean, and Enoch, and Noah, and the rest; upon
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; for as regards Joseph, even Pharaoh perceived
that he had *the Spirit of God within him* <span
id="fr_2057"></span>[2058](#fn_2057.md) .  As to Moses, and the wonderful
works wrought by the Spirit in his days, thou hast heard often:  This
Spirit Job also had, that most enduring man, and all the saints, though
we repeat not all their names.  He also was sent forth when the
Tabernacle was in making, and filled with wisdom the wise-hearted men
who were with Bezaleel <span id="fr_2058"></span>[2059](#fn_2058.md) .

<span id="ii.xx-p124"></span>28.  In the might of this Spirit, as we
have it in the Book of Judges, Othniel judged <span
id="fr_2059"></span>[2060](#fn_2059.md) ; Gideon <span
id="fr_2060"></span>[2061](#fn_2060.md) waxed strong; Jephtha
conquered <span id="fr_2061"></span>[2062](#fn_2061.md) ; Deborah, a woman,
waged war; and Samson, so long as he did righteously, and grieved Him
not, wrought deeds above man’s power.  And as for Samuel and David, we
have it plainly in the Books of the Kingdoms, how by the Holy Ghost they
prophesied themselves, and were rulers of the prophets;—and Samuel was
called *the Seer* <span id="fr_2062"></span>[2063](#fn_2062.md) ; and David
says distinctly, *The Spirit of the Lord spake by me* <span
id="fr_2063"></span>[2064](#fn_2063.md) , and in the Psalms, *And take not
thy Holy Spirit from me* <span id="fr_2064"></span>[2065](#fn_2064.md) ,
and again, *Thy good Spirit shall lead me in the land of
righteousness* <span id="fr_2065"></span>[2066](#fn_2065.md) .  And as we
have it in Chronicles, Azariah <span
id="fr_2066"></span>[2067](#fn_2066.md) , in the time of King Asa, and
Jahaziel <span id="fr_2067"></span>[2068](#fn_2067.md) in the time of King
Jehoshaphat, partook of the Holy Ghost; and again, another Azariah, he
who was stoned <span id="fr_2068"></span>[2069](#fn_2068.md) .  And Ezra
says, *Thou gavest also Thy good Spirit to instruct them* <span
id="fr_2069"></span>[2070](#fn_2069.md) .  But as touching Elias who was
taken up, and Elisseus, those inspired <span
id="fr_2070"></span>[2071](#fn_2070.md) and wonder-working men, it is
manifest, without our saying so, that they were full of the Holy Ghost.

<span id="ii.xx-p137"></span>29.  And if further a man peruse all the
books of the Prophets, both of the Twelve, and of the others, he will
find many testimonies concerning. the Holy Ghost; as when Micah says in
the person of God, *surely I will perfect power by the Spirit the
Lord* <span id="fr_2071"></span>[2072](#fn_2071.md) ; and Joel cries, *And
it shall come to pass afterwards*, saith God, *that I will pour out My
Spirit upon all flesh* <span id="fr_2072"></span>[2073](#fn_2072.md) , and
the rest; and Haggai, *Because I am with you, saith the Lord of
Hosts* <span id="fr_2073"></span>[2074](#fn_2073.md) ; and *My Spirit
remaineth in the midst of you* <span
id="fr_2074"></span>[2075](#fn_2074.md) ; and in like manner Zechariah,
*But receive My words and My statutes which I command by My Spirit, to
My servants the Prophets* <span id="fr_2075"></span>[2076](#fn_2075.md) ;
and other passages.

<span id="ii.xx-p143"></span>30.  Esaias too, with his majestic voice,
says, *And the Spirit of God shall rest upon Him,* <span
id="page_123">p. 123</span> <span id="ii.xx-Page_123"></span>*the spirit
of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit
of knowledge and godliness; and the Spirit of the fear of God shall fill
Him* <span id="fr_2076"></span>[2077](#fn_2076.md) ; signifying that the
Spirit is one and undivided, but His operations various.  So again,
*Jacob My servant*,…..*I have put My Spirit upon Him* <span
id="fr_2077"></span>[2078](#fn_2077.md) .  And again, *I will pour My
Spirit upon thy seed* <span id="fr_2078"></span>[2079](#fn_2078.md) ; and
again, *And now the Lord Almighty and His Spirit hath sent Me* <span
id="fr_2079"></span>[2080](#fn_2079.md) ; and again, *This is My covenant
with them, saith the Lord, My Spirit which is upon thee* <span
id="fr_2080"></span>[2081](#fn_2080.md) ; and again, *The Spirit of the
Lord is upon Me, because He hath anointed Me* <span
id="fr_2081"></span>[2082](#fn_2081.md) , and the rest; and again in his
charge against the Jews, *But they rebelled and vexed His Holy
Spirit* <span id="fr_2082"></span>[2083](#fn_2082.md) , and *Where is He
that put His Holy Spirit within them* <span
id="fr_2083"></span>[2084](#fn_2083.md) ?  Also thou hast in Ezekiel (if
thou be not now weary of listening), what has already been quoted, *And
the Spirit fell upon me, and said unto me, Speak; Thus saith the
Lord* <span id="fr_2084"></span>[2085](#fn_2084.md) .  But the words, *fell
upon me* we must understand in a good sense, that is “lovingly;” and as
Jacob, when he had found Joseph, fell upon his neck; as also in the
Gospels, the loving father, on seeing his son who had returned from his
wandering, *had compassion, and ran and fell on his neck, and kissed
him* <span id="fr_2085"></span>[2086](#fn_2085.md) .  And again in Ezekiel,
*And he brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldæa, to
them of the captivity* <span id="fr_2086"></span>[2087](#fn_2086.md) .  And
other texts thou heardest before, in what was said about Baptism; *Then
will I sprinkle clean water upon you* <span
id="fr_2087"></span>[2088](#fn_2087.md) , and the rest; *a new heart also
will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you* <span
id="fr_2088"></span>[2089](#fn_2088.md) ; and then immediately, *And I will
put My Spirit within you* <span id="fr_2089"></span>[2090](#fn_2089.md) . 
And again, *The hand of the Lord was upon me, and carried me out in the
Spirit of the Lord* <span id="fr_2090"></span>[2091](#fn_2090.md) .

<span id="ii.xx-p159"></span>31.  He endued with wisdom the soul of
Daniel, that young as he was he should become a judge of Elders.  The
chaste Susanna was condemned as a wanton; there was none to plead her
cause; for who was to deliver her from the rulers?  She was led away to
death, she was now in the hands of the executioners.  But her Helper was
at hand, the Comforter, the Spirit who sanctifies every rational
nature.  Come hither to me, He says to Daniel; young though thou be,
convict old men infected with the sins of youth; for it is written, *God
raised up the Holy Spirit upon a young stripling* <span
id="fr_2091"></span>[2092](#fn_2091.md) ; and nevertheless, (to pass on
quickly,) by the sentence of Daniel that chaste lady was saved.  We
bring this forward as a testimony; for this is not the season for
expounding.  Nebuchadnezzar also knew that the Holy Spirit was in
Daniel; for he says to him, *O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, of
whom I know, that the Holy Spirit of God is in thee* <span
id="fr_2092"></span>[2093](#fn_2092.md) .  One thing he said truly, and one
falsely; for that he had the Holy Spirit was true, but he was not the
*master of the magicians*, for he was no magician, but was wise through
the Holy Ghost.  And before this also, he interpreted to him the vision
of the Image, which he who had seen it himself knew not; for he says,
Tell me the vision, which I who saw it know not <span
id="fr_2093"></span>[2094](#fn_2093.md) .  Thou seest the power of the Holy
Ghost; that which they who saw it, know not, they who saw it not, know
and interpret.

<span id="ii.xx-p163"></span>32.  And indeed it were easy to collect
very many texts out of the Old Testament, and to discourse more largely
concerning the Holy Ghost.  But the time is short; and we must be
careful of the proper length of the lecture.  Wherefore, being for the
present content awhile with passages from the Old Testament, we will, if
it be God’s pleasure, proceed in the next Lecture to the remaining texts
out of the New Testament.  And may the God of peace, through our Lord
Jesus Christ, and through the love of the Spirit, count all of you
worthy of His spiritual and heavenly gifts:—To whom be glory and power
for ever and ever.  Amen.

<span id="ii.xx-p9"></span> At the end of this section there follows in
the Coislin <span class="sc"><span id="ii.xx-p9.1"></span>ms.</span> a
long interpolation consisting of two parts.  The former is an extract
taken word for word from Gregory of Nyssa, *Oratio Catechetica*, ii. c,
which may be read in this series:  <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.xx-p9.2"></span>᾽</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.xx-p9.3"></span>Αλλ᾽ ὡς Θεοῦ Λόγον ἀκούσαντες</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.xx-p9.4"></span> .…</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.xx-p9.5"></span>σύνδρομον ἔχουσαν τῇ βουλήσει
τὴν δύναμιν</span>.  Of the second passage the Benedictine Editor says: 
“I have not been able to discover who is the author.  No one can assign
it to our Cyril, although the doctrine it contains is in full agreement
with his:  but he explains all the same points more at large in his two
Lectures (xvi. xvii.).  The passage is very ancient and undoubtedly
older than the eleventh century, which is the date of the Cod. Coislin. 
Therefore in the controversy of the Latins against the Greeks concerning
the Procession of the Holy Ghost it is important to notice what is
taught in this passage, and also brought forward as a testimony by S.
Thomas (Aquinas), that “The Holy Ghost is of the Godhead of the Father
and the Son (ex Patris et Filii divinitate existere).”  To me indeed
these words seem to savour altogether not of the later but of the more
ancient theology of the Greeks, and to be earlier than the controversies
of the Greeks against the Latins.”

<span id="ii.xx-p10"></span>This second passage is as follows:—

<span id="ii.xx-p11"></span>“For the Spirit of God is good.  *And Thy
good Spirit*, says David, *shall lead me in the land of righteousness*. 
This then is the Spirit of God in which we believe:  the blessed Spirit,
the eternal, immutable, unchangeable, ineffable:  which rules and reigns
over all productive being, both visible and invisible natures:  which is
Lord both of Angels and Archangels, Powers, Principalities, Dominions,
Thrones:  the Creator of all being, enthroned with the glory of the
Father and the Son, reigning without beginning and without end with the
Father and the Son, before the created substances:  Who sanctifies the
*ministering spirits sent forth for the sake of those who are to inherit
salvation*:  Who came down upon the holy and blessed Virgin Mary, of
whom was born Christ according to the flesh; came down also upon the
Lord Himself in bodily form of a dove in the river Jordan:  Who came
upon the Apostles on the day of Pentecost in form of fiery tongues; Who
gives and supplies all spiritual gifts in the Church, <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.xx-p11.1"></span>Who Proceedeth from the
Father</span>:  Who is of the Godhead of the Father and the Son; Who is
of one substance with the Father and the Son, inseparable and
indivisible.”

III. xxi. 4; IV. ix. 1.  In Eusebius, *E.H.* V. 13, Rhodon says that
Apelles attributed the prophecies to an adverse spirit and rejected them
as false and self-contradictory.  Similar blasphemies against the holy
Prophets are imputed to Manes by Epiphanius (*Hæres*. lxvi. 30).

<span id="ii.xx-p17"></span> Cat. xvii. 13.  Epiphanius (*De Mensuris et
Ponder. c.* 14):  “And he (Hadrian) found the city all levelled to the
ground, except a few houses, and the Church of God which was small: 
where the Disciples, on their return after the Saviour was taken up from
the Mount of Olives, went up into the upper chamber:  for there it had
been built, that is on Sion.”  Cf. Stanley, *Sinai and Palestine*, c.
xiv. 3:  “Within the precincts of that Mosque (of the Tomb of David) is
a vaulted Gothic chamber, which contains within its four walls a greater
confluence of traditions than any other place of like dimensions in
Palestine.  It is startling to hear that this is the scene of the Last
Supper, of the meeting after the Resurrection, of the miracle of
Pentecost, of the residence and death of the Virgin, of the burial of
Stephen.”

<span id="ii.xx-p21"></span> Irenæus is called “the interpreter” in the
same general sense as other ecclesiastical authors (Cat. xiii. 21; xv.
20), on account of his frequent comments upon the Scriptures.  The full
title of his work was *A Refutation and Subversion of Knowledge falsely
so called* (Euseb. *Hist. Eccles*. V. c. 7).  Cyril’s expression (<span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.xx-p21.1"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.xx-p21.2"></span>ν τοῖς προστάγμασι</span>)
is sufficiently appropriate to the hortatory purpose professed by
Irenæus in his preface.  But the Benedictine Editor thinks that the word
<span class="Greek"><span id="ii.xx-p21.3"></span>προστάγμασι</span> may
be an interpolation arising from the following words <span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.xx-p21.4"></span>πρὸς τὰς</span>.…The meaning
would then be “in his writings *Against Heresies*,” the usual short
title of the work.

desolation as the oracle itself says, like a lodge in a garden of
cucumbers.  As Cyril at that time saw the Prophet’s prediction
fulfilled, so we also to the present day see most plainly the fulfilment
of the divine oracle, and Sion ploughed before our eyes:  for except the
Church of the Apostles, with the houses lying around it, and the house
of Caiaphas and the cemeteries, all the remaining space of this hill,
lying without the city, is under plough.” (Jerusalem Editor).

<span class="Greek"><span id="ii.xx-p88.2"></span>ὀ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.xx-p88.3"></span>πωροφυλάκιον</span> is the
hut of the watchman who guarded the crop when ripening for harvest. 
<span class="Greek"><span id="ii.xx-p88.4"></span>Σικυήλατον</span> is
explained by Basil in his comment on the passage of Isaiah as “A place
that produces quick-growing and perishable fruits.”  This agrees with
the etymological sense of the word as “a forcing-bed for cucumbers”
(Hippocrates apud Fritzsche, “*<span id="ii.xx-p88.5"></span>Der Brief
des Jeremia*,” *v*. 70).  On the form <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.xx-p88.6"></span>σικυηράτῳ</span>, see the notes on the Epistle
of Jeremy in the Speaker’s Commentary.

on Herodotus, II. 148, 169 in Bähr, and Rawlinson.  Here it appears to

Editor quotes from Origen (*Prolog. in Cantic.)* a passage which may
have been known to Cyril:  “This Comforter therefore goeth about seeking
if He may discover any worthy and receptive souls to whom He may reveal
the greatness of the love which is in God.”
