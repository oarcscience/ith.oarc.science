id="ii.xxvii-p5.3"></span></span>

<span id="ii.xxvii-p6"></span>*Wherefore putting away all filthiness,
and all guile, and evil speaking* <span
id="fr_2471"></span>[2472](#fn_2471.md) *, &c.*

<span id="ii.xxvii-p8"></span>1.  <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.xxvii-p8.1"></span>By</span> the loving-kindness of God ye have
heard sufficiently at our former meetings concerning Baptism, and
Chrism, and partaking of the Body and Blood of Christ; and now it is
necessary to pass on to what is next in order, meaning to-day to set the
crown on the spiritual building of your edification.

<span id="ii.xxvii-p9"></span>2.  Ye have seen then the Deacon who gives
to the Priest water to wash <span id="fr_2472"></span>[2473](#fn_2472.md) ,
and to the Presbyters who stand round God’s altar.  He gave it not at
all because of bodily defilement; it is not that; for we did not enter
the Church at first <span id="fr_2473"></span>[2474](#fn_2473.md) with
defiled bodies.  But the washing of hands is a symbol that ye ought to
be pure from all sinful and unlawful deeds; for since the hands are a
symbol of action, by washing <span id="fr_2474"></span>[2475](#fn_2474.md)
them, it is evident, we represent the purity and blamelessness of our
conduct.  Didst thou not hear the blessed David opening this very
mystery, and saying, *I will wash my hands in innocency, and so will
compass Thine Altar, O Lord* <span id="fr_2475"></span>[2476](#fn_2475.md)
?  The washing therefore of hands is a symbol of immunity <span
id="fr_2476"></span>[2477](#fn_2476.md) from sin.

<span id="ii.xxvii-p15"></span>3.  Then the Deacon cries aloud, “Receive
ye one another; and let us kiss one another <span
id="fr_2477"></span>[2478](#fn_2477.md) .”  Think not that this kiss is of
the same character with those given in public by common friends.  It is
not such:  but this kiss blends souls one with another, and courts
entire forgiveness for them.  The kiss therefore is the sign that our
souls are mingled together, and banish all remembrance of wrongs.  For
this cause Christ said, *If thou art offering thy gift at the altar, and
there rememberest that thy brother hath aught against time, leave there
thy gift upon the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy
brother, and then come and offer thy gift* <span
id="fr_2478"></span>[2479](#fn_2478.md) .  The kiss therefore is
reconciliation, and for this reason holy:  as the blessed Paul somewhere
cried, saying, *Greet ye one another with a holy kiss* <span
id="fr_2479"></span>[2480](#fn_2479.md) ; and Peter, *with a kiss of
charity* <span id="fr_2480"></span>[2481](#fn_2480.md) .

<span id="ii.xxvii-p20"></span>4.  After this the Priest cries aloud,
“Lift up your hearts <span id="fr_2481"></span>[2482](#fn_2481.md) .”  For
truly ought we in that most awful hour to have our heart on high with
God, and not below, thinking of earth and earthly things.  In effect
therefore the Priest bids all in that hour to dismiss all cares of this
life, or household anxieties, and to have <span id="page_154">p.
154</span> <span id="ii.xxvii-Page_154"></span>their heart in heaven
with the merciful God.  Then ye answer, “We lift them up unto the
Lord:”  assenting to it, by your avowal.  But let no one come here, who
could say with his mouth, “We lift up our hearts unto the Lord,” but in
his thoughts have his mind concerned with the cares of this life.  At
all times, rather, God should be in our memory but if this is impossible
by reason of human infirmity, in that hour above all this should be our
earnest endeavour.

<span id="ii.xxvii-p22"></span>5.  Then the Priest says, “Let us give
thanks unto the Lord.”  For verily we are bound to give thanks, that He
called us, unworthy as we were, to so great grace; that He reconciled us
when we were His foes; that He vouchsafed to us the Spirit of adoption. 
Then ye say, “It is meet and right:”  for in giving thanks we do a meet
thing and a right; but He did not right, but more than right, in doing
us good, and counting us meet for such great benefits.

<span id="ii.xxvii-p23"></span>6.  After this, we make mention of
heaven, and earth, and sea <span id="fr_2482"></span>[2483](#fn_2482.md) ;
of sun and moon; of stars and all the creation, rational and irrational,
visible and invisible; of Angels, Archangels, Virtues, Dominions,
Principalities, Powers, Thrones; of the Cherubim with many faces:  in
effect repeating that call of David’s *Magnify the Lord with me* <span
id="fr_2483"></span>[2484](#fn_2483.md) .  We make mention also of the
Seraphim, whom Esaias in the Holy Spirit saw standing around the throne
of God, and with two of their wings veiling their face, and with twain
their feet, while with twain they did fly, crying *Holy, Holy, Holy, is
the Lord of Sabaoth* <span id="fr_2484"></span>[2485](#fn_2484.md) .  For
the reason of our reciting this confession of God <span
id="fr_2485"></span>[2486](#fn_2485.md) , delivered down to us from the
Seraphim, is this, that so we may be partakers with the hosts of the
world above in their Hymn of praise.

<span id="ii.xxvii-p28"></span>7.  Then having sanctified ourselves by
these spiritual Hymns, we beseech the merciful God to send forth His
Holy Spirit upon the gifts lying before Him; that He may make the Bread
the Body of Christ, and the Wine the Blood of Christ <span
id="fr_2486"></span>[2487](#fn_2486.md) ; for whatsoever the Holy Ghost has
touched, is surely sanctified and changed.

<span id="ii.xxvii-p30"></span>8.  Then, after the spiritual sacrifice,
the bloodless service, is completed, over that sacrifice of
propitiation <span id="fr_2487"></span>[2488](#fn_2487.md) we entreat God
for the common peace of the Churches, for the welfare of the world <span
id="fr_2488"></span>[2489](#fn_2488.md) ; for kings; for soldiers and
allies; for the sick; for the afflicted; and, in a word, for all who
stand in need of succour we all pray and offer this sacrifice.

<span id="ii.xxvii-p33"></span>9.  Then we commemorate also those who
have fallen asleep before us, first Patriarchs, Prophets, Apostles,
Martyrs, that at their prayers and intercessions God would receive our
petition <span id="fr_2489"></span>[2490](#fn_2489.md) .  Then on behalf
also of the Holy Fathers and Bishops who have fallen asleep before us,
and in a word of all who in past years have fallen asleep among us,
believing that it will be a very great benefit to the souls <span
id="fr_2490"></span>[2491](#fn_2490.md) , for whom the supplication is put
up, while that holy and most awful sacrifice is set forth.

<span id="ii.xxvii-p36"></span>10.  And I wish to persuade you by an
illustration.  For I know that many say, what is a soul profited, which
departs from this world either with sins, or without sins, if it be
commemorated in the prayer?  For if a king were to banish certain who
had given him offence, and then those who belong to them <span
id="fr_2491"></span>[2492](#fn_2491.md) <span id="page_155">p. 155</span>
<span id="ii.xxvii-Page_155"></span>should weave a crown and offer it to
him on behalf of those under punishment, would he not grant a remission
of their penalties?  In the same way we, when we offer to Him our
supplications for those who have fallen asleep, though they be sinners,
weave no crown, but offer up Christ sacrificed for our sins <span
id="fr_2492"></span>[2493](#fn_2492.md) , propitiating our merciful God for
them as well as for ourselves.

<span id="ii.xxvii-p39"></span>11.  Then, after these things, we say
that Prayer which the Saviour delivered to His own disciples, with a
pure conscience entitling God our Father, and saying, *Our Father, which
art in heaven*.  O most surpassing loving-kindness of God!  On them who
revolted from Him and were in the very extreme of misery has He bestowed
such a complete forgiveness of evil deeds, and so great participation of
grace, as that they should even call Him Father.  *Our Father, which art
in heaven*; and they also are a heaven who *bear the image of the
heavenly* <span id="fr_2493"></span>[2494](#fn_2493.md) , in whom is God,
*dwelling and walking in them* <span
id="fr_2494"></span>[2495](#fn_2494.md) .

<span id="ii.xxvii-p42"></span>12.  *Hallowed be Thy Name*.  The Name of
God is in its nature holy, whether we say so or not; but since it is
sometimes profaned among sinners, according to the words, *Through you
My Name is continually blasphemed among the Gentiles* <span
id="fr_2495"></span>[2496](#fn_2495.md) , we pray that in us God’s Name may
be hallowed; not that it comes to be holy from not being holy, but
because it becomes holy in us, when we are made holy, and do things
worthy of holiness.

<span id="ii.xxvii-p44"></span>13.  *Thy kingdom come*.  A pure soul can
say with boldness, *Thy kingdom come*; for he who has heard Paul saying,
*Let not therefore sin reign in your mortal body* <span
id="fr_2496"></span>[2497](#fn_2496.md) , and has cleansed himself in deed,
and thought, and word, will say to God, *Thy kingdom come*.

<span id="ii.xxvii-p46"></span>14.  *Thy will be done as in heaven so on
earth*.  God’s divine and blessed Angels do the will of God, as David
said in the Psalm, *Bless the Lord, all ye Angels of His, mighty in
strength, that do His pleasure* <span
id="fr_2497"></span>[2498](#fn_2497.md) .  So then in effect thou meanest
this by thy prayer, “as in the Angels Thy will is done, so likewise be
it done on earth in me, O Lord.”

<span id="ii.xxvii-p48"></span>15.  *Give us this day our substantial
bread*.  This common bread is not substantial bread, but this Holy Bread
is substantial, that is, appointed for the substance of the soul <span
id="fr_2498"></span>[2499](#fn_2498.md) .  For this Bread *goeth* not *into
the belly and is cast out into the draught* <span
id="fr_2499"></span>[2500](#fn_2499.md) , but is distributed into thy whole
system for the benefit of body and soul <span
id="fr_2500"></span>[2501](#fn_2500.md) .  But by *this day*, he means,
“each day,” as also Paul said, *While it is called to-day* <span
id="fr_2501"></span>[2502](#fn_2501.md) .

<span id="ii.xxvii-p53"></span>16.  *And forgive us our debts as we also
forgive our debtors*.  For we have many sins.  For we offend both in
word and in thought, and very many things we do worthy of condemnation;
and *if we say that we have no sin*, we lie, as John says <span
id="fr_2502"></span>[2503](#fn_2502.md) .  And we make a covenant with God,
entreating Him to forgive us our sins, as we also forgive our neighbours
their debts.  Considering then what we receive and in return for what,
let us not put off nor delay to forgive one another.  The offences
committed against us are slight and trivial, and easily settled; but
those which we have committed against God are great, and need such mercy
as His only is.  Take heed therefore, lest for the slight and trivial
sins against thee thou shut out for thyself forgiveness from God for thy
very grievous sins.

<span id="ii.xxvii-p55"></span>17.  *And lead us not into temptation, O
Lord*.  Is this then what the Lord teaches us to pray, that we may not
be tempted at all?  How then is it said elsewhere, “a man untempted, is
a man unproved <span id="fr_2503"></span>[2504](#fn_2503.md) ;” and again,
*My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers
temptations* <span id="fr_2504"></span>[2505](#fn_2504.md) ?  But does
perchance the entering into temptation mean the being overwhelmed by the
temptation?  For temptation is, as it were, like a winter torrent
difficult to cross.  Those therefore who are not overwhelmed in
temptations, pass through, shewing themselves excellent swimmers, and
not being swept away by them at all; while those who are not such, enter
into them and are overwhelmed.  As for example, Judas having entered
into the temptation of the love of money, swam not through it, but was
overwhelmed and was strangled <span id="fr_2505"></span>[2506](#fn_2505.md)
both in body and spirit.  Peter entered into the temptation of the
denial; but having entered, he was not over<span id="page_156">p.
156</span> <span id="ii.xxvii-Page_156"></span>whelmed by it, but
manfully swam through it, and was delivered from the temptation <span
id="fr_2506"></span>[2507](#fn_2506.md) .  Listen again, in another place,
to a company of unscathed saints, giving thanks for deliverance from
temptation, *Thou, O God hast proved us; Thou hast tried us by fire like
as silver is tried.  Thou broughtest us into the net; Thou layedst
afflictions upon our loins.  Thou hast caused men to ride over our
heads; we went through fire and water; and thou broughtest us out into a
place of rest* <span id="fr_2507"></span>[2508](#fn_2507.md) .  Thou seest
them speaking boldly in regard to their having passed through and not
been pierced <span id="fr_2508"></span>[2509](#fn_2508.md) .  *But Thou
broughtest us out into a place of rest*; now their coming into a place
of rest is their being delivered from temptation.

<span id="ii.xxvii-p62"></span>18.  *But deliver us from the evil*.  If
*Lead us not into temptation* implied the not being tempted at all, He
would not have said, *But deliver us from the evil*.  Now evil is our
adversary the devil, from whom we pray to be delivered <span
id="fr_2509"></span>[2510](#fn_2509.md) .  Then after completing the prayer
thou sayest, *Amen* <span id="fr_2510"></span>[2511](#fn_2510.md) ; by this
*Amen*, which means “So be it,” setting thy seal to the petitions of the
divinely-taught prayer.

<span id="ii.xxvii-p65"></span>19.  After this the Priest says, “Holy
things to holy men.”  Holy are the gifts presented, having received the
visitation of the Holy Ghost; holy are ye also, having been deemed
worthy of the Holy Ghost; the holy things therefore correspond to the
holy persons <span id="fr_2511"></span>[2512](#fn_2511.md) .  Then ye say,
“One is Holy, One is the Lord, Jesus Christ <span
id="fr_2512"></span>[2513](#fn_2512.md) .”  For One is truly holy, by
nature holy; we too are holy, but not by nature, only by participation,
and discipline, and prayer.

<span id="ii.xxvii-p68"></span>20.  After this ye hear the chanter
inviting you with a sacred melody to the communion of the Holy
Mysteries, and saying, *O taste and see that the Lord is good* <span
id="fr_2513"></span>[2514](#fn_2513.md) .  Trust not the judgment to thy
bodily palate <span id="fr_2514"></span>[2515](#fn_2514.md) no, but to
faith unfaltering; for they who taste are bidden to taste, not bread and
wine, but the anti-typical <span id="fr_2515"></span>[2516](#fn_2515.md)
Body and Blood of Christ.

<span id="ii.xxvii-p72"></span>21.  In approaching <span
id="fr_2516"></span>[2517](#fn_2516.md) therefore, come not with thy wrists
extended, or thy fingers spread; but make thy left hand a throne for the
right, as for that which is to receive a King <span
id="fr_2517"></span>[2518](#fn_2517.md) .  And having hollowed thy palm,
receive the Body of Christ, saying over it, *Amen*.  So then after
having carefully hallowed thine eyes by the touch of the Holy Body,
partake of it; giving heed lest thou lose any portion thereof <span
id="fr_2518"></span>[2519](#fn_2518.md) ; for whatever thou losest, is
evidently a loss to thee as it were from one of thine own members.  For
tell me, if any one gave thee grains of gold, wouldest thou not hold
them with all carefulness, being on thy guard against losing any of
them, and suffering loss?  Wilt thou not then much more carefully keep
watch, that not a crumb fall from thee of what is more precious than
gold and precious stones?

<span id="ii.xxvii-p76"></span>22.  Then after thou hast partaken of the
Body of Christ, draw near also to the Cup of His Blood; not stretching
forth thine hands, but bending <span
id="fr_2519"></span>[2520](#fn_2519.md) , and saying with an air of worship
and reverence, *Amen* <span id="fr_2520"></span>[2521](#fn_2520.md) ,
hallow thyself by partaking also of the Blood of Christ.  And while the
moisture is still upon thy lips, touch it with thine hands, and hallow
thine eyes and brow and the other organs of sense <span
id="fr_2521"></span>[2522](#fn_2521.md) .  Then wait for the prayer, and
give thanks unto God, who hath accounted thee worthy of so great
mysteries <span id="fr_2522"></span>[2523](#fn_2522.md) .

<span id="ii.xxvii-p81"></span><span id="page_157">p. 157</span> <span
id="ii.xxvii-Page_157"></span>23.  Hold fast these traditions undefiled
and, keep yourselves free from offence.  Sever not yourselves from the
Communion; deprive not yourselves, through the pollution of sins, of
these Holy and Spiritual Mysteries.  *And the God of peace sanctify you
wholly; and may your spirit, and soul, and body be preserved entire
without blame at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ* <span
id="fr_2523"></span>[2524](#fn_2523.md) :—To whom be glory and honour and
might, with the Father and the Holy Spirit, now and ever, and world
without end.  Amen.

<span id="ii.xxvii-p10"></span> In the *Apostolic Constitutions*, VIII.
xi, this duty is assigned to a sub-deacon:  “Let one of the sub-deacons
bring water to wash the hands of the priests, which is a symbol of the
purity of those souls that are devoted to God.”  See *Dictionary of
Christian Antiquities,* “Lavabo.”  The Priest who celebrates the
Eucharist is here distinguished by the title <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.xxvii-p10.1"></span>ἱ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.xxvii-p10.2"></span>ερεύς</span> from the other Presbyters who
stood round the altar.

<span id="fn_2473"></span>[153:2474](2070039.htm#fr_2473.md) <span
id="ii.xxvii-p10.3"></span>

<span id="ii.xxvii-p11"></span> Cyril evidently refers to the custom of
placing vessels of water outside the entrance of the Church.  Bingham,
*Antiquities*, VIII. iii. 6.  Chrysost. *In Johannem Hom*. lxxiii. 3: 
“Do we then wash our hands when going into Church, and shall we not wash
our hearts also?”  That the same custom was observed in heathen Temples
appears from Herod. I. 51:  <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.xxvii-p11.1"></span>περιῤῥαντήρια δύο ἀνέθηκε</span> (See Bähr’s
note).  Compare also Joseph. *Ant. Jud*. III. vi. 2.

id="ii.xxvii-p12.6"></span>νιψάμενοι</span>, which would easily become
altered through the presence of <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.xxvii-p12.7"></span>νιψασθαι</span> in the preceding line.  This
washing is not mentioned in the Liturgy of St. James.

<span id="fn_2475"></span>[153:2476](2070039.htm#fr_2475.md) <span

<span id="ii.xxvii-p13"></span> [Ps. xxvi.
6](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#006.md)<span id="ii.xxvii-p13.1"></span>. 
In the Liturgy of Constantinople this Psalm was chanted by the Priest
and Deacon while washing their hands at the Prothesis or Credence.

<span id="fn_2476"></span>[153:2477](2070039.htm#fr_2476.md) <span

id="ii.xxvii-p15.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxvii-p16"></span> These two directions by the Deacon are
separated in the Liturgy of St. James:  after the dismissal of the
Catechumens, the Deacon says, “Take note one of another;” and after the
Incense, Cherubic hymn, Oblation, Creed, and a short prayer “that we may
be united one to another in the bond of peace and charity,” the Deacon
says, “Let us salute (<span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.xxvii-p16.1"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.xxvii-p16.2"></span>γαπῶμεν</span>) one another with a holy
kiss.”  In the *Apostolic Constitutions*, VIII. 11, there is but one
such direction, and this comes before the washing of hands and the
dismissal of the Catechumens, “Salute (<span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.xxvii-p16.3"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.xxvii-p16.4"></span>σπάσασθε</span>) ye one another with a holy
kiss.”

id="ii.xxvii-p16.5"></span>

<span id="ii.xxvii-p17"></span> [Matt. v.
23](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#023.md)<span id="ii.xxvii-p17.1"></span>. 
From Cyril’s reference to this passage “it may be inferred that the kiss
of peace had been given before the gifts were brought to the altar,
according to ancient custom attested by Justin M. *Apolog*. i. c. 65: 
‘Having ended the prayers’ (for the newly baptized) ‘we salute one
another with a kiss.  Then there is brought to the President of the
brethren bread, and a cup of wine mixed with water’” (Ben. Ed.).  There
is the same order in the *Apost. Const.* VIII. 12, and in the 19th Canon
of the Synod of Laodicea; but in the Liturgy of S. James the gifts are
offered before the kiss of peace.

<span id="ii.xxvii-p21"></span> The words are slightly varied in the

the Liturgy of St. James:  “It is verily meet, right, becoming, and our
bounden duty to praise Thee, to sing of Thee, to bless Thee, to worship
Thee, to glorify Thee, to give thanks to Thee the Maker of every
creature, visible and invisible, the Treasure of eternal blessings; the
Fount of life and immortality, the God and Lord of all, whom the heavens
of heavens do praise, and all the powers thereof, sun and moon and all
the choir of the stars, earth, sea, and all that in them is, Jerusalem
the heavenly assembly, Church of the firstborn that are written in the
heavens, spirits of righteous men and prophets, souls of martyrs and
Apostles.  Angels, Archangels, Thrones, Dominions, Principalities,
Authorities, and Powers dread, also the many-eyed Cherubim, and the
six-winged Seraphim, which with twain of their wings cover their faces,
and with twain their feet, and with twain do fly, crying one to another
with unresting lips, in unceasing praises, singing with loud voice the
triumphant hymn of Thy majestic glory, shouting, and glorifying, and
crying aloud, and saying,—Holy, Holy, Holy, O Lord of Hosts, heaven and
earth are full of Thy glory.  Hosanna in the highest; blessed is He that
cometh in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.”

<span id="ii.xxvii-p29"></span> In the Liturgy of St. James the
Triumphal Hymn is followed by the ‘Recital of the work of Redemption,’
and of ‘the Institution,’ by the ‘Great Olbation,’ and then by the
‘Invocation,’ as follows:  “Have mercy upon us, O God, after Thy great
mercy, and send forth on us, and on these gifts here set before Thee,
Thine all-holy Spirit,.…that He may come, and by His holy, good, and
glorious advent (<span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.xxvii-p29.1"></span>παρουσίᾳ</span>) may sanctify this Bread and
make it the holy Body of Thy Christ (*Amen*), and this Cup the precious
Blood of Thy Christ” (*Amen*).  In Cat. xix. 7, Cyril calls this prayer
“the holy Invocation of the Adorable Trinity,” and in xxi. 3, “the
Invocation of the Holy Ghost.”

<span id="ii.xxvii-p31"></span> See Index, “Sacrifice,” and the
reference there to the Introduction.  Compare Athenagoras (*Apol*. c.

need?  Though indeed it behoves us to bring a bloodless sacrifice, and
the *reasonable service*.”

<span id="ii.xxvii-p32"></span> Cyril here gives a brief summary of the
“Great Intercession,” in which, according to the common text of the
Liturgy of St. James, there is a suffrage “for the peace and welfare
(<span class="Greek"><span id="ii.xxvii-p32.1"></span>εὐστάθεια</span>)
of the whole world, and of the holy Churches of God.”  Mr. Hammond
thinks that it has been taken from the Deacon’s Litany, and repeated by
mistake in the Great Intercession.  But from Chrysostom’s language (*In
Ep. ad Phil*. Hom. iii. p. 218; Guame, T. xi. p. 251), we must infer
that the prayer <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.xxvii-p32.2"></span>ὑ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.xxvii-p32.3"></span>πὲρ εἰρήνης καὶ εὐσταθείας τοῦ κόσμου</span>
formed part of the ‘Great Intercession’ in his Liturgy, as it does in
the Clementine (*Apost. Constit*. VIII. § 10).

<span id="fn_2489"></span>[154:2490](2070039.htm#fr_2489.md) <span
id="ii.xxvii-p33.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxvii-p34"></span> In the Liturgies of St. James and St.
Mark, and in the Clementine, there are similar commemorations of
departed saints, especially “patriarchs, prophets, apostles, martyrs,”
but nothing corresponding to the words, “that at their prayers and
intercessions God would receive our petition.”  See Index, *Prayer* and
*Intercession*.

<span id="fn_2490"></span>[154:2491](2070039.htm#fr_2490.md) <span

<span id="ii.xxvii-p35"></span> So Chrysostom (*In* 1 *Cor.* Hom. 41, p.
457 A):  “Not in vain was this rule ordained by the Apostles, that in
the dread Mysteries remembrance should be made of the departed:  for
they knew that it is a great gain to them, and a great benefit.”

Jesus Christ, blessed for ever, to the glory of God the Father.”  The
Liturgies of St. James and of Constantinople have nearly the same
words:  in the Liturgy of St. Mark the answer of the people is:  One
Father holy, one Son holy, one Spirit holy, in the unity of the Holy
Spirit.

authority for thus placing the hands in the form of a Cross.  A similar
direction is given in the 101st Canon of the Trullan Council (692), and
by Joh. Damasc. (*De Fid. Orthod*. iv. 14).  *Dict. Chr. Ant.*
“*Communion*.”  That the communicant was to receive the Bread in his own
hands is clear from the language of Cyril and other Fathers.  Cf. Clem.
Alex. *Strom*. I. c. i. § 5:  “Some after dividing the Eucharist
according to custom allow each of the laity himself to take his part.” 
See the passage of Origen quoted in the next note, and Tertull. *Cor.
Mil*. c. iii.  “The Sacrament of the Eucharist, which the Lord commanded
both (to be taken) at meal-times and by all, we take even in assemblies
before dawn, and from the hand of none but the presidents.”

wish to admonish you by examples from your own religion:  ye, who have
been accustomed to attend the Sacred Mysteries, know how, when you
receive the Body of the Lord, you guard it with all care and reverence,
that no little part of it fall down, no portion of the consecrated gift
