id="iv.iv.vii.vi-p1.1"></span>Ep. CXXIV.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.vii.vi-p2"></span>(A little later on, when the weather
was more settled, Gregory accepts the invitation and proposes to come at
once, but declines to attend the Provincial Synod.)

<span id="iv.iv.vii.vi-p3"></span>You call me?  And I hasten, and that
for a private visit.  Synods and Conventions I salute from afar, since I
have experienced that most of them (to speak moderately) are but sorry
affairs.  What then remains?  Help with your prayers my just desires
that I may obtain that for which I am anxious.
