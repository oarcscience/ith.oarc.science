id="iv.iv.ix.i-p1.1"></span>§9.  To Olympius.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.ix.i-p2"></span>(Olympius was Prefect of Cappadocia
Secunda in 382.  One letter to him against the Apollinarians, has
already been given; the rest, which are to follow are mainly
recommendations of various persons to his patronage.)

<span id="iv.iv.ix.i-p3"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="iv.iv.ix.i-p3.1"></span>Ep. CIV.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.ix.i-p4"></span>All The Other favours which I have
received I know to be due to your kindness; and may God reward you for
them with His own mercies; and may one of these be, that you may
discharge your office of prefect with good fame and splendour from
beginning to end.  In what I now ask I come rather to give than to
receive, if it is not arrogant to say so.  I personally introduce poor
Philumena to you, to entreat your justice, and to move you to the tears
with which she afflicts my soul.  She herself will explain to you in
what and by whom she has been wronged, for it would not be right for me
to bring accusations against any one.  But this much it is necessary for
me to say, that widowhood and orphanhood have a right to the assistance
of all right-minded men, and especially of those who have wife and
children, those great pledges of pity, since we—ourselves only men—are
set to judge men.  Pardon me that I plead with you for these by letter,
since it is by ill health that I am deprived of seeing a ruler so kind
and so conspicuous for virtue that even the prelude of your
administration is more precious than the good fame of others even at the
end of their term.
