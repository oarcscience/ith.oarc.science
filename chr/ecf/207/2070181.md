id="iv.iv.ix.xi-p1.1"></span>Ep. CXLIV.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.ix.xi-p2"></span>(Verianus, a citizen of Nazianzus, had
been offended by his son-in-law, and on this account wished his daughter
to sue for a divorce.  Olympius referred the matter to the Episcopal
arbitration of S. Gregory, who refused to countenance the proceeding,
and writes the two following letters, the first to the Prefect, the
second to Verianus himself.)

<span id="iv.iv.ix.xi-p3"></span>Haste is not always praiseworthy.  For
this reason I have deferred my answer until now about the daughter of
the most honorable Verianus, both to allow for time setting matters
right, and also because I conjecture that Your Goodness does not approve
of the divorce, inasmuch as you entrusted the enquiry to me, whom you
knew to be neither hasty nor uncircumspect in such matters.  Therefore I
have refrained myself till now, and, I venture to think, not without
reason.  But since we have come nearly to the end of the allotted time,
and it is necessary that you should be informed of the result of the
examination I will inform you.  The young lady seems to me to be of two
minds, divided between reverence for her parents and affection for her
husband.  Her words are on their side, but her mind, I rather think, is
with her husband, as is shewn by her tears.  You will do what commends
itself to your justice, and to God who directs you in all things.  I
should most willingly have given my opinion to my son Verianus that he
should pass over much of what is in question, with a view not to confirm
the divorce, which is entirely contrary to our law, <span
id="fr_4780"></span>[4781](#fn_4780.md) though the Roman law may determine
otherwise.  For it is necessary that justice be observed—which I pray
you may ever both say and do.
