id="ii.iii.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VIII.—Place of S. Cyril’s
Lectures.</span>

<span id="ii.iii.viii-p2"></span>We have seen in a passage already
quoted <span id="fr_306"></span>[307](#fn_306.md) that at Milan S. Ambrose
expounded the Creed to Catechumens in the Baptistery.  But whatever may
have been the custom in other places, it is certain from numerous
passages in Cyril’s Lectures that they were delivered in the great
Basilica, or Church of the Resurrection, built by Constantine on the
site of the Holy Sepulchre, and consecrated, as we have seen, with great
splendour in the year 335 <span id="fr_307"></span>[308](#fn_307.md) .  In
a passage <span id="fr_308"></span>[309](#fn_308.md) where Cyril is
speaking of the descent of the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost, he
says, “as we discourse on Christ and Golgotha here in Golgotha, so it
were most fitting that we should also speak concerning the Holy Ghost in
the Upper Church; yet since He who descended there jointly partakes of
the glory of Him who was crucified here, we here speak concerning Him
also who descended there.”  It appears from a passage in the
Introductory Lecture <span id="fr_309"></span>[310](#fn_309.md) that it was
delivered in the Church itself before the whole congregation, after that
portion of the daily Service to which Catechumens were usually
admitted:  “Dost thou behold this venerable constitution of the Church? 
Dost thou view her order and discipline, the reading of Scripture, the
presence of the Ordained, the course of instruction?”  The same custom
was retained in Jerusalem in the time of John, Cyril’s successor in the
Bishopric, who in writing to Jerome says, “The custom with us is that we
deliver the doctrine of the Holy Trinity publicly during forty days to
those who are to be baptized <span id="fr_310"></span>[311](#fn_310.md) .”

<span id="ii.iii.viii-p8"></span>The Mystagogic Lectures were delivered
not in the Church, but after the conclusion of the public Service “in
the Holy Place of the Resurrection itself <span
id="fr_311"></span>[312](#fn_311.md) ,” that is, in the small Chapel which
contained the Holy Sepulchre, and to which the name “Anastasis” more
properly belonged.  Happily we are not required by the purpose of this
work to enter into the disputed questions concerning the Holy Places. 
Whether the cave re-fashioned and adorned by Constantine was the actual
sepulchre in which our Lord’s body was laid, and whether the present
Churches occupy the same site as the Basilica and Anastasis of
Constantine, are matters still under discussion, and awaiting the result
of further researches.  What more properly concerns us is to collect the
chief passages in which Cyril refers to these localities, and to try to
give a fair representation of his testimony, comparing it with that of
earlier or contemporary writers.

<span id="ii.iii.viii-p10"></span>Next to Eusebius, and the Bordeaux
Pilgrim who visited Jerusalem in 333, Cyril is the earliest and most
important witness as to the site of Constantine’s Churches.

<span id="ii.iii.viii-p11"></span>In Cat. xiv. § 5, he says, “It was a
garden where He was crucified.  For though it has now been most highly
adorned with royal gifts, yet formerly it was a garden, and the signs
and the remnants of this remain.”  From this it is evident that the
traces of a garden close to the Church were still visible both to Cyril
and his hearers.  Twice again in § 11 he mentions the garden, which he
had most probably himself seen in its former state, before the ground
was cleared at the time of the recovery of the Holy Sepulchre in 326.

<span id="ii.iii.viii-p12"></span>On this point it may be well to quote
the words of Mr. Walter Besant, Honorary Secretary of the Palestine
Exploration Fund, who, in an article on “The Holy Sepulchre” in the
*Dictionary of Christian Antiquities*, writes as follows:  “While the
temple of Venus with its foundations was being cleared away, there might
have been, and most probably was present, a Christian lad, native of
Jerusalem, eleven years of age, watching the discovery, which did as
much as the great luminous cross which appeared in the sky four (?
twenty-four) years later to confirm the doubtful and strengthen the
faithful, that of the rock containing the <span id="page_l">p. l</span>
<span id="ii.iii.viii-Page_l"></span>sacred tomb.  It was Cyril,
afterwards Bishop of Jerusalem.  One must not forget that he is the
third eye-witness who speaks of these things; that though he was a boy
at the time of the discovery, he lived in Jerusalem, and must have
watched, step by step, the progress of the great Basilica; that he was
ordained before the completion and dedication of the buildings, and that
many, if not all, of his lectures were delivered in the Church of the
Anastasis itself.”

<span id="ii.iii.viii-p13"></span>That Cyril’s testimony concerning the
Holy Places was in full accordance with the general belief of his
contemporaries is clear from the fact that he so frequently points to
the traditional sites as bearing witness to the truth of the Crucifixion
and Resurrection.  He speaks of Golgotha in eight separate passages,
sometimes as near to the Church in which he and his hearers are
assembled <span id="fr_312"></span>[313](#fn_312.md) , and sometimes as
standing up above in their sight <span id="fr_313"></span>[314](#fn_313.md)
.  In one place he asks, “Seest thou this spot of Golgotha?” and the
hearers answer with a shout of approval <span
id="fr_314"></span>[315](#fn_314.md) .  In other passages he speaks as if
the Church itself was *in* or rather *on* Golgotha <span
id="fr_315"></span>[316](#fn_315.md) , the same Preposition (<span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.viii-p17.7"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.viii-p17.8"></span>ν</span>) being
repeated when he mentions “Him who was crucified thereon.”

<span id="ii.iii.viii-p18"></span>In explanation of these different
modes of speaking, the Benedictine Editor comments thus <span
id="fr_316"></span>[317](#fn_316.md) :  “The Church of the Resurrection was
built on part of the hill Golgotha (*intra montem G*.):  but the actual
rock on which our Lord was crucified was not within the limits of the
Church, yet not far off, namely about “a stone’s throw,” as the author
of the *Jerusalem Itinerary* says.  For the Church had been built on the
site of the Sepulchre.  Some think that the place of Crucifixion was
included in the vast area which was enclosed with colonnades between the
Sepulchre and the Basilica,…that Golgotha was midway between the
Basilica of the Crucifixion, and the Anastasis or Sepulchre.  But the
area in question Constantine paved with stones, and it must therefore
have been flat, as we learn from Eusebius <span
id="fr_317"></span>[318](#fn_317.md) ; Golgotha, on the contrary, stood up
high <span id="fr_318"></span>[319](#fn_318.md) , and moreover shewed a
cleft made there at Christ’s death <span
id="fr_319"></span>[320](#fn_319.md) , which would either have been a
hindrance to the paving or covered up by it.  In addition to this, from
the doors of the Basilica there seems to have been a view of the Sacred
Tomb <span id="fr_320"></span>[321](#fn_320.md) .  This would have been
obstructed if Golgotha had been between them.”

<span id="ii.iii.viii-p24"></span>The cleft in the rock of Golgotha is
mentioned in a fragment of the defence made before Maximinus in 311 or
312 by Lucian the Martyr of Antioch <span
id="fr_321"></span>[322](#fn_321.md) :  If yet you believe not, I will also
offer you the testimony of the very spot on which the thing was done. 
The place itself in Jerusalem vouches for these facts, and the rock of
Golgotha broken asunder under the weight of the Cross:  that cave also,
which when the gates of hell were burst, gave back the Body in newness
of life.”  On this passage Dr. Routh remarks that Maundrell, *Journey
from Aleppo to Jerusalem, at Easter*, 1697, “shews that the rock had
been rent not by any instrument, but by the force of an earthquake. 
Also it is related by Eusebius in his Theophania, a book now recovered,
that there was one cave only in this cleft of the rock.”

<span id="ii.iii.viii-p26"></span>According to Eusebius in the passages
of the *Life of Constantine* already referred to, the Emperor first
beautified the monument or sepulchre with rare columns, then paved with
finely polished stone a large area open to the sky, and enclosed on
three sides with long colonnades, and lastly erected the Church itself
“at the side opposite to the cave, which was the Eastern side.”

<span id="ii.iii.viii-p27"></span><span id="page_li">p. li</span> <span
id="ii.iii.viii-Page_li"></span>The following is the statement of the
Bordeaux Pilgrim:  “From thence (the Palace of David) as you go out of
the wall of Sion walking towards the gate of Neapolis, on the right side
below in the valley are walls where the house or Prætorium of Pontius
Pilate was:  here our Lord was tried before His Passion.  On the left
hand is the little hill (*monticulus*) of Golgotha, where the Lord was
crucified.  About a stone’s throw from thence is a vault (*crypta*)
wherein His body was laid, and rose again on the third day.  There by
command of the Emperor Constantine has now been built a Basilica, that
is to say, a Church of wondrous beauty, having at the side reservoirs
(*exceptoria*) from which water is raised, and a bath behind in which
infants are washed (baptized).”  Neapolis was the name given by
Vespasian to the ancient city of Shechem, now Nâbulus:  the “porta
Neapolitana” therefore was in the North wall of Sion.

<span id="ii.iii.viii-p28"></span>In reference to the passage quoted
above, Mr. Aubrey Stewart says:  “The narrative is clear and connected,
and it is hardly possible, for any one who knows the ground, to read it
without feeling that the Pilgrim from Bordeaux actually saw
Constantine’s buildings standing on the site now occupied by the Church
of the Holy Sepulchre <span id="fr_322"></span>[323](#fn_322.md) .”

<span id="ii.iii.viii-p30"></span>From these earlier testimonies,
compared with the several passages already quoted from Cyril, we may
safely draw the following inferences, (1) The Anastasis properly so
called, or Church of the Holy Sepulchre, in which the five Mystagogic
Lectures were delivered, was built by Constantine over the cave which,
according to the evidence then existing, was fully believed to be the
Burial-place of our Lord.  (2) The Great Basilica, called also the
Church of the Holy Cross, in which the Catechetical Lectures were
delivered, was erected on the East of the Anastasis, and separated from
it by a large open area.  (3) The hill of Golgotha (on which at a later
period there was built a third Church, called the Church of Golgotha, of
Holy Calvary, or of Cranium) stood about a stone’s throw on the North
side of Constantine’s two Churches, and about equidistant from them.
