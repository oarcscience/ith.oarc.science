<p class="c23"><a name="iv.iv.ix.ix-p2"></A>Though my desire to meet you is warm, and the need of your petitioners is great, yet my illness is invincible.&#160; Therefore I am bold to commit my intercession to writing.&#160; Have respect to our gray hair, which you have already often reverenced by good actions.&#160; Have respect also to my infirmity, to which my labours for God have in part contributed, if I may swagger a little.&#160; For this cause spare the citizens who look to me because I use some freedom of speech with you.&#160; And spare also the others who are under my care.&#160; For public affairs will suffer no damage through mercy, since you can do more by fear than others by punishment.&#160; May you, as your reward for this, obtain such a Judge as you shew yourself to your petitioners and to me their intercessor.</p>
