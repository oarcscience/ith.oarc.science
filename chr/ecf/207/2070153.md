<span id="iv.iv.vii.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.iv.vii.iii-p1.1"></span>Ep. CXXI.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.vii.iii-p2"></span>(Written a little later, as a letter
of thanks for an Easter Gift.  Theodore had quite recently been made
Archbishop of Tyana.)

<span id="iv.iv.vii.iii-p3"></span>We rejoice in the tokens of love, and
especially at such a season, and from one at once so young a man, and so
perfect; and, to greet you with the words of Scripture, stablished in
your youth, <span id="fr_4763"></span>[4764](#fn_4763.md) for so it calls
him who is more advanced in wisdom than his years lead us to expect. 
The old Fathers prayed for the dew of heaven and fatness of the
earth <span id="fr_4764"></span>[4765](#fn_4764.md) and other such things
for their children, though perhaps some may understand these things in a
higher sense; but we will give you back all in a spiritual sense.  The
Lord fulfil all thy requests, <span id="fr_4765"></span>[4766](#fn_4765.md)
and mayest thou be the father of such children <span
id="fr_4766"></span>[4767](#fn_4766.md) (if I may pray for you concisely
and intimately) as you yourself have shewn yourself to your own parents,
so that we, as well as every one else, may be glorified concerning you.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.iii-p7"></span> It seems clear, as Benoît remarks,
that this expression refers to Spiritual fatherhood.  Theodore does not
appear to have been married.
