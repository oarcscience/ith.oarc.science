### <span id="ix.viii.lii-p0.1"></span>LII.

<span id="ix.viii.lii-p1"></span><span
id="ix.viii.lii-p1.1"></span>The <span
id="fr_4901"></span>[4902](#fn_4901) sacred books acknowledge with
regard to Christ, that as He is the Son of man, so is the same Being not
a \[mere\] man; and as He is flesh, so is He also spirit, and the Word
of God, and God. And as He was born of Mary in the last times, so did He
also proceed from God as the First-begotten of every creature; and as He
hungered, so did He satisfy \[others\]; and as He thirsted, so did He of
old cause the Jews to drink, for the “Rock was Christ” <span
id="fr_4902"></span>[4903](#fn_4902) Himself: thus does Jesus now give
to His believing people power to drink spiritual waters, which spring up
to life eternal. <span id="fr_4903"></span>[4904](#fn_4903) And as He
was the son of David, so was He also the Lord of David. And as He was
from Abraham, so did He also exist before Abraham. <span
id="fr_4904"></span>[4905](#fn_4904) And as He was the servant of God,
so is He the Son of God, and Lord of the universe. And as He was spit
upon ignominiously, so also did He breathe the Holy Spirit into His
disciples. <span id="fr_4905"></span>[4906](#fn_4905) And as He was
saddened, so also did He give joy to His people. And as He was capable
of being handled and touched, so again did He, in a non-apprehensible
form, pass through the midst of those who sought to injure Him, <span
id="fr_4906"></span>[4907](#fn_4906) and entered without impediment
through closed doors. <span id="fr_4907"></span>[4908](#fn_4907) And as
He slept, so did He also rule the sea, the winds, and the storms. And as
He suffered, so also is He alive, and life-giving, and healing all our
infirmity. And as He died, so is He also the Resurrection of the dead.
He suffered shame on earth, while He is higher than all glory and praise
in heaven; who, “though He was crucified through weakness, yet He liveth
by divine power;” <span id="fr_4908"></span>[4909](#fn_4908) who
“descended into the lower parts of the earth,” and who “ascended up
above the heavens;” <span id="fr_4909"></span>[4910](#fn_4909) for whom
a manger <span id="page_577">p. 577</span> <span
id="ix.viii.lii-Page_577"></span> sufficed, yet who filled all things;
who was dead, yet who liveth for ever and ever. Amen.
