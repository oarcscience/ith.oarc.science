### <span id="vii.ii.vi-p0.1"></span>VI. <span id="fr_1754"></span>[1755](#fn_1754)

<span id="vii.ii.vi-p2"></span>\[Papias, who is now mentioned by us,
affirms that he received the sayings of the apostles from those who
accompanied them, and he moreover asserts that he heard in person
Aristion and the presbyter John. <span
id="fr_1755"></span>[1756](#fn_1755) Accordingly he mentions them
frequently by name, and in his writings gives their traditions. Our
notice of these circumstances may not be without its use. It may also be
worth while to add to the statements of Papias already given, other
passages of his in which he relates some miraculous deeds, stating that
he acquired the knowledge of them from tradition. The residence of the
Apostle Philip with his daughters in Hierapolis has been mentioned
above. We must now point out how Papias, who lived at the same time,
relates that he had received a wonderful narrative from the daughters of
Philip. For he relates that a dead man was raised to life in his
day. <span id="fr_1756"></span>[1757](#fn_1756) He also mentions another
miracle relating to Justus, surnamed Barsabas, how he swallowed a deadly
poison, and received no harm, on account of the grace of the Lord. The
same person, moreover, has set down other things as coming to him from
unwritten tradition, amongst these some strange parables and
instructions of the Saviour, and some other things of a more fabulous
nature. <span id="fr_1757"></span>[1758](#fn_1757) Amongst these he says
that there will be a millennium after the resurrection from the dead,
when the personal reign of Christ will be established on this earth. He
moreover hands down, in his own writing, other narratives given by the
previously mentioned Aristion of the Lord’s sayings, and the traditions
of the presbyter John. <span id="vii.ii.vi-p5.1"></span>For information
on these points, we can merely refer our readers to the books
themselves; but now, to the extracts already made, we shall add, as
being a matter of primary importance, a tradition regarding Mark who
wrote the Gospel, which he \[Papias\] has given in the following
words\]: And the presbyter said this. Mark having become the <span
id="page_155">p. 155</span> <span id="vii.ii.vi-Page_155"></span>
interpreter of Peter, wrote down accurately whatsoever he remembered. It
was not, however, in exact order that he related the sayings or deeds of
Christ. For he neither heard the Lord nor accompanied Him. But
afterwards, as I said, he accompanied Peter, who accommodated his
instructions to the necessities \[of his hearers\], but with no
intention of giving a regular narrative of the Lord’s sayings. Wherefore
Mark made no mistake in thus writing some things as he remembered them.
For of one thing he took especial care, not to omit anything he had
heard, and not to put anything fictitious into the statements. <span
id="vii.ii.vi-p5.2"></span>\[This is what is related by Papias regarding
Mark; but with regard to Matthew he has made the following statements\]:
Matthew put together the oracles \[of the Lord\] in the Hebrew language,
and each one interpreted them as best he could. \[The same person uses
proofs from the First Epistle of John, and from the Epistle of Peter in
like manner. And he also gives another story of a woman <span
id="fr_1758"></span>[1759](#fn_1758) who was accused of many sins before
the Lord, which is to be found in the Gospel according to the Hebrews.\]

<span id="vii.ii.vi-p4"></span> “In his day” may mean “in the days of
Papias,” or “in the days of Philip.” As the narrative came from the
daughters of Philip, it is more likely that Philip’s days are meant.
