### <span id="ix.vi.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.—Answer to the cavils of the Gnostics. We are not to suppose that the true God can be changed, or come to an end because the heavens, which are His throne and the earth, His footstool, shall pass away.

<span id="ix.vi.iv-p1"></span>1. <span id="ix.vi.iv-p1.1"></span>Again,
as to their malignantly asserting that if heaven is indeed the throne of
God, and earth His footstool, and if it is declared that the heaven and
earth shall pass away, then when these pass away the God who sitteth
above must also pass away, and therefore He cannot be the God who is
over all; in the first place, they are ignorant what the expression
means, that heaven is \[His\] throne and earth \[His\] footstool. For
they do not know what God is, but they imagine that He sits after the
fashion of a man, and is contained within bounds, but does not contain.
And they are also unacquainted with \[the meaning of\] the passing away
of the heaven and earth; but Paul was not ignorant of it when he
declared, “For the figure of this world passeth away.” <span
id="fr_3829"></span>[3830](#fn_3829.md) In the next place, David explains
their question, for he says that when the fashion of this world passes
away, not only shall God remain, but His servants also, expressing
himself thus in the 101st Psalm: “In the beginning, Thou, O <span
class="upper"><span id="ix.vi.iv-p2.2"></span>Lord</span>, hast founded
the earth, and the heavens are the works of Thy hands. They shall
perish, but Thou shalt endure, and all shall wax old as a garment; and
as a vesture Thou shalt change them, and they shall be changed: but Thou
art the same, and Thy years shall not fail. The children of Thy servants
shall continue, and their seed shall be established for ever;” <span
id="fr_3830"></span>[3831](#fn_3830.md) pointing out plainly what things
they are that pass away, and who it is that doth endure for ever—God,
together with His servants. And in like manner Esaias says: “Lift up
your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath; for the
heaven has been set together as smoke, and the earth shall wax old like
a garment, and they who dwell therein shall die in like manner. But my
salvation shall be for ever, and my righteousness shall not pass
away.” <span id="fr_3831"></span>[3832](#fn_3831.md)

The cause of the difference in the numbering of the Psalms is that the
Septuagint embraces in one psalm—the ninth—the two which form the ninth
and tenth in the Hebrew text.
