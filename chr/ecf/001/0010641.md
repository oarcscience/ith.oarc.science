### <span id="viii.vi.xxxi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXI.—Further proof of Plato’s acquaintance with Scripture.

<span id="viii.vi.xxxi-p1"></span><span
id="viii.vi.xxxi-p1.1"></span>For from what other source, if not from
his reading the writings of the prophets, could Plato have derived the
information he gives us, that Jupiter drives a winged chariot in heaven?
For he knew this from the following expressions of the prophet about the
cherubim: “And the glory of the Lord went out from the house and rested
on the cherubim; and the cherubim lift up their wings, and the wheels
beside them; and the glory of the Lord God of Israel was over them
above.” <span id="fr_2581"></span>[2582](#fn_2581.md) And borrowing this
idea, the magniloquent Plato shouts aloud with vast assurance, “The
great Jove, indeed, driving his winged chariot in heaven.” For from what
other source, if not from Moses and the prophets, did he learn this and
so write? And whence did he receive the suggestion of his saying that
God exists in a fiery substance? Was it not from the third book of the
history of the Kings, where it is written, “The Lord was not in the
wind; and after the wind an earthquake, but the Lord was not in the
earthquake; and after the earthquake a fire, but the Lord was not in the
fire; and after the fire a still small voice?” <span
id="fr_2582"></span>[2583](#fn_2582.md) But these things pious men must
understand in a higher sense with profound and meditative insight. But
Plato, not attending to the words with the suitable insight, said that
God exists in a fiery substance.
