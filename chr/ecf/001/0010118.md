### <span id="iv.iv.xx-p0.1"></span>Chapter XX.—This epistle is to be transmitted to the brethren.

<span id="iv.iv.xx-p1"></span>Since, then, ye requested that we would at
large make you acquainted with what really took place, we have for the
present sent you this summary account through our brother Marcus. When,
therefore, ye have yourselves read this Epistle, <span
id="fr_473"></span>[474](#fn_473.md) be pleased to send it to the brethren
at a greater distance, that they also may glorify the Lord, who makes
such choice of His own servants. <span id="iv.iv.xx-p2.1"></span>To Him
who is able to bring us all by His grace and goodness <span
id="fr_474"></span>[475](#fn_474.md) into his everlasting kingdom, through
His only-begotten Son Jesus Christ, to Him be glory, and honour, and
power, and majesty, for ever. Amen. Salute all the saints. They that are
with us salute you, and Evarestus, who wrote this Epistle, with all his
house.
