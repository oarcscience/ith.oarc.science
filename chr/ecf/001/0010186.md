### <span id="v.v.x-p0.1"></span>Chapter X.—Conclusion.

<span id="v.v.x-p1"></span>Now I write these things to you from Smyrna
by the Ephesians, who are deservedly most happy. There is also with me,
along with many others, Crocus, one dearly beloved by me. <span
id="fr_877"></span>[878](#fn_877.md) As to those who have gone before me
from Syria to Rome for the glory of God, I believe that you are
acquainted with them; to whom, \[then,\] do ye make known that I am at
hand. For they are all worthy, both of God and of you; and it is
becoming that you should refresh them in all things. I have written
these things unto you, on the day before the ninth of the Kalends of
September (that <span id="fr_878"></span>[879](#fn_878.md) is, on the
twenty-third day of August). Fare ye well to the end, in the patience of
Jesus Christ. Amen.

<span id="v.v.x-p3"></span> This clause is evidently an explanatory
gloss which has crept into the text.
