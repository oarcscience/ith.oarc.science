### <span id="ii.ii.xiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIII.—An exhortation to humility.

<span id="ii.ii.xiii-p1"></span><span id="ii.ii.xiii-p1.1"></span><span
id="ii.ii.xiii-p1.2"></span>Let us therefore, brethren, be of humble
mind, laying aside all haughtiness, and pride, and foolishness, and
angry feelings; and let us act according to that which is written (for
the Holy Spirit saith, “Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom,
neither let the mighty man glory in his might, neither let the rich man
glory in his riches; but let him that glorieth glory in the Lord, in
diligently seeking Him, and doing judgment and righteousness” <span
id="fr_54"></span>[55](#fn_54) .md), being especially mindful of the words
of the Lord Jesus which He spake, teaching us meekness and
long-suffering. For thus He spoke: “Be ye merciful, that ye may obtain
mercy; forgive, that it may be forgiven to you; as ye do, so shall it be
done unto you; as ye judge, so shall ye be judged; as ye are kind, so
shall kindness be shown to you; with what measure ye mete, with the same
it shall be measured to you.” <span id="fr_55"></span>[56](#fn_55.md) By
this precept and by these rules let us establish ourselves, that we walk
with all humility in obedience to His holy words. For the holy word
saith, “On whom shall I look, but on him that is meek and peaceable, and
that trembleth at My words?” <span id="fr_56"></span>[57](#fn_56.md)
