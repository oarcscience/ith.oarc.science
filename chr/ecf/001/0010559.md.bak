### <span id="viii.iv.xcviii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XCVIII.—Predictions of Christ in [Ps. xxii.](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#000.md)<span id="viii.iv.xcviii-p0.2"></span>

shall repeat the whole Psalm, in order that you may hear His reverence
to the Father, and how He refers all things to Him, and prays to be
delivered by Him from this death; at the same time declaring in the
Psalm who they are that rise up against Him, and showing that He has
truly become man capable of suffering. <span
id="viii.iv.xcviii-p1.4"></span>It is as follows: ‘O God, my God, attend
to me: why hast Thou forsaken me? The words of my transgressions are far
from my salvation. O my God, I will cry to Thee in the day-time, and
Thou wilt not hear; and in the night-season, and it is not for want of
understanding in me. But Thou, the Praise of Israel, inhabitest the holy
place. Our fathers trusted in Thee; they trusted, and Thou didst deliver
them. They cried unto Thee, and were delivered: they trusted in Thee,
and were not confounded. But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men,
and despised of the people. All they that see me laughed me to scorn;
they spake with the lips, they shook the head: He trusted on the Lord:
let Him deliver him, let Him save him, since he desires Him. For Thou
art He that took me out of the womb; my hope from the breasts of my
mother: I was cast upon Thee from the womb. Thou art my God from my
mother’s belly: be not far from me, for trouble is near; for there is
none to help. Many calves have compassed me; fat bulls have beset me
round. They opened their mouth upon me, as a ravening and roaring lion.
All my bones are poured out and dispersed like water. My heart has
become like wax melting in the midst of my belly. My strength is dried
up like a potsherd; and my tongue has cleaved to my throat; and Thou
hast brought me into the dust of death. For many dogs have surrounded
me; the assembly of the wicked have beset me round. They pierced my
hands and my feet, they did tell all my bones. They did look and stare
upon me; they parted my garments among them, and cast lots upon my
vesture. But do not Thou remove Thine assistance from me, O Lord: give
heed to help me; deliver my soul from the sword, and my <span

dog. Save me from the lion’s mouth, and my humility from the horns of
the unicorns. I will declare Thy name to my brethren; in the midst of
the Church will I praise Thee. Ye that fear the Lord, praise Him: all ye
the seed of Jacob, glorify Him. Let all the seed of Israel fear Him.’ ”
