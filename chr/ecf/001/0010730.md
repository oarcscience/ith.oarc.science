### <span id="ix.iii.i-p0.1"></span>Preface.

<span id="ix.iii.i-p1"></span>1. <span class="upper"><span
id="ix.iii.i-p1.1"></span>In</span> the first book, which immediately
precedes this, exposing “knowledge falsely so called,” <span
id="fr_2985"></span>[2986](#fn_2985) I showed thee, my very dear friend,
that the whole system devised, in many and opposite ways, by those who
are of the school of Valentinus, was false and baseless. I also set
forth the tenets of their predecessors, proving that they not only
differed among themselves, but had long previously swerved from the
truth itself. I further explained, with all diligence, the doctrine as
well as practice of Marcus the magician, since he, too, belongs to these
persons; and I carefully noticed <span
id="fr_2986"></span>[2987](#fn_2986) the passages which they garble from
the Scriptures, with the view of adapting them to their own fictions.
Moreover, I minutely narrated the manner in which, by means of numbers,
and by the twenty-four letters of the alphabet, they boldly endeavour to
establish \[what they regard as\] truth. I have also related how they
think and teach that creation at large was formed after the image of
their invisible Pleroma, and what they hold respecting the Demiurge,
declaring at the same time the doctrine of Simon Magus of Samaria, their
progenitor, and of all those who succeeded him. I mentioned, too, the
multitude of those Gnostics who are sprung from him, and noticed <span
id="fr_2987"></span>[2988](#fn_2987) the points of difference between
them, their several doctrines, and the order of their succession, while
I set forth all those heresies which have been originated by them. I
showed, moreover, that all these heretics, taking their rise from Simon,
have introduced impious and irreligious doctrines into this life; and I
explained the nature of their “redemption,” and their method of
initiating those who are rendered “perfect,” along with their
invocations and their mysteries. I proved also that there is one God,
the Creator, and that He is not the fruit of any defect, nor is there
anything either above Him, or after Him.2. In the present book, I shall
establish those points which fit in with my design, so far as time
permits, and overthrow, by means of lengthened treatment under distinct
heads, their whole system; for which reason, since it is an exposure and
subversion of their opinions, I have so entitled the composition of this
work. For it is fitting, by a plain revelation and overthrow of their
conjunctions, to put an end to these hidden alliances, <span
id="fr_2988"></span>[2989](#fn_2988) and to Bythus himself, and thus to
obtain a demonstration that he never existed at any previous time, nor
now has any existence.
