<span id="ix.iii.xviii"></span>

### <span id="ix.iii.xviii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVII.—Inquiry into the production of the Æons: whatever its supposed nature, it is in every respect inconsistent; and on the hypothesis of the heretics, even Nous and the Father Himself would be stained with ignorance.

<span id="ix.iii.xviii-p1"></span>1. <span
id="ix.iii.xviii-p1.1"></span>That system, then, which has respect to
their Pleroma, and especially that part of it which refers to the
primary Ogdoad being thus burdened with so great contradictions and
perplexities, let me now go on to examine the remainder of their scheme.
\[In doing so\] on account of their madness, I shall be making inquiry
respecting things which have no real existence; yet it is necessary to
do this, since the treatment of this subject has been entrusted to me,
and since I desire all men <span id="page_381">p. 381</span> <span
id="ix.iii.xviii-Page_381"></span> to come to the knowledge of the
truth, as well as because thou thyself hast asked to receive from me
full and complete means for overturning \[the views of\] these men.

<span id="ix.iii.xviii-p2"></span>2. I ask, then, in what manner were
the rest of the Æons produced? Was it so as to be united with Him who
produced them, even as the solar rays are with the sun; or was it
actually <span id="fr_3072"></span>[3073](#fn_3072.md) and separately, so
that each of them possessed an independent existence and his own special
form, just as has a man from another man, and one herd of cattle from
another? Or was it after the manner of germination, as branches from a
tree? And were they of the same substance with those who produced them,
or did they derive their substance from some other \[kind of\]
substance? Also, were they produced at the same time, so as to be
contemporaries; or after a certain order, so that some of them were
older, and others younger? And, again, are they uncompounded and
uniform, and altogether equal and similar among themselves, as spirit
and light are produced; or are they compounded and different, unlike
\[to each other\] in their members?

<span id="ix.iii.xviii-p4"></span>3. If each of them was produced, after
the manner of men, actually and according to its own generation, then
either those thus generated by the Father will be of the same substance
with Him, and similar to their Author; or if <span
id="fr_3073"></span>[3074](#fn_3073.md) they appear dissimilar, then it
must of necessity be acknowledged that they are \[formed\] of some
different substance. Now, if the beings generated by the Father be
similar to their Author, then those who have been produced must remain
for ever impassible, even as is He who produced them; but if, on the
other hand, they are of a different substance, which is capable of
passion, then whence came this dissimilar substance to find a place
within the incorruptible Pleroma? Further, too, according to this
principle, each one of them must be understood as being completely
separated from every other, even as men are not mixed with nor united
the one to the other, but each having a distinct shape of his own, and a
definite sphere of action, while each one of them, too, is formed of a
particular size, —qualities characteristic of a body, and not of a
spirit. Let them therefore no longer speak of the Pleroma as being
*spiritual*, or of themselves as “spiritual,” if indeed their Æons sit
feasting with the Father, just as if they were men, and He Himself is of
such a configuration as those reveal Him to be who were produced by Him.

<span id="ix.iii.xviii-p6"></span>4. <span
id="ix.iii.xviii-p6.1"></span>If, again, the Æons were derived from
Logos, Logos from Nous, and Nous from Bythus, just as lights are kindled
from a light—as, for example, torches are from a torch—then they may no
doubt differ in generation and size from one another; but since they are
of the same substance with the Author of their production, they must
either all remain for ever impassible, or their Father Himself must
participate in passion. For the torch which has been kindled
subsequently cannot be possessed of a different kind of light from that
which preceded it. Wherefore also their lights, when blended in one,
return to the original identity, since that one light is then formed
which has existed even from the beginning. But we cannot speak, with
respect to light itself, of some part being more recent in its origin,
and another being more ancient (for the whole is but one light); nor can
we so speak even in regard to those torches which have received the
light (for these are all contemporary as respects their material
substance, for the substance of torches is one and the same), but simply
as to \[the time of\] its being kindled, since one was lighted a little
while ago, and another has just now been kindled.

<span id="ix.iii.xviii-p7"></span>5. The defect, therefore, of that
passion which has regard to ignorance, will either attach alike to their
whole Pleroma, since \[all its members\] are of the same substance; and
the Propator will share in this defect of ignorance—that is, will be
ignorant of Himself; or, on the other hand, all those lights which are
within the Pleroma will alike remain for ever impassible. Whence, then,
comes the passion of the youngest Æon, if the light of the Father is
that from which all other lights have been formed, and which is by
nature impassible? And how can one Æon be spoken of as either younger or
older among themselves, since there is but one light in the entire
Pleroma? And if any one calls them stars, they will all nevertheless
appear to participate in the same nature. For if “one star differs from
another star in glory,” <span id="fr_3074"></span>[3075](#fn_3074.md) but
not in qualities, nor substance, nor in the fact of being passible or
impassible; so all these, since they are alike derived from the light of
the Father, must either be naturally impassible and immutable, or they
must all, in common with the light of the Father, be passible, and are
capable of the varying phases of corruption.

<span id="ix.iii.xviii-p9"></span>6. The same conclusion will follow,
although they affirm that the production of Æons sprang from Logos, as
branches from a tree, since Logos has his generation from their Father.
For all \[the Æons\] are formed of the same substance with the Father,
differing from one another only in size, and not in nature, and filling
up the greatness of the Father, even as the fingers complete <span
id="page_382">p. 382</span> <span id="ix.iii.xviii-Page_382"></span> the
hand. If therefore He exists in passion and ignorance, so must also
those Æons who have been generated by Him. But if it is impious to
ascribe ignorance and passion to the Father of all, how can they
describe an Æon produced by Him as being passible; and while they
ascribe the same impiety to the very wisdom (Sophia) of God, how can
they still call themselves religious men?

<span id="ix.iii.xviii-p10"></span>7. If, again, they declare that their
Æons were sent forth just as rays are from the sun, then, since all are
of the same substance and sprung from the same source, all must either
be capable of passion along with Him who produced them, or all will
remain impassible for ever. For they can no longer maintain that, of
beings so produced, some are impassible and others passible. If, then,
they declare all impassible, they do themselves destroy their own
argument. For how could the youngest Æon have suffered passion if all
were impassible? If, on the other hand, they declare that all partook of
this passion, as indeed some of them venture to maintain, then, inasmuch
as it originated with Logos, <span id="fr_3075"></span>[3076](#fn_3075.md)
but flowed onwards to Sophia, they will thus be convicted of tracing
back the passion to Logos, who is the <span
id="fr_3076"></span>[3077](#fn_3076.md) Nous of this Propator, and so
acknowledging the Nous of the Propator and the Father Himself to have
experienced passion. For the Father of all is not to be regarded as a
kind of compound Being, who can be separated from his Nous (mind), as I
have already shown; but Nous is the Father, and the Father Nous. It
necessarily follows, therefore, both that he who springs from Him as
Logos, or rather that Nous himself, since he is Logos, must be perfect
and impassible, and that those productions which proceed from him,
seeing that they are of the same substance with himself, should be
perfect and impassible, and should ever remain similar to him who
produced them.

<span id="ix.iii.xviii-p13"></span>8. It cannot therefore longer be
held, as these men teach, that Logos, as occupying the third place in
generation, was ignorant of the Father. Such a thing might indeed
perhaps be deemed probable in the case of the generation of human
beings, inasmuch as these frequently know nothing of their parents; but
it is altogether impossible in the case of the Logos of the Father. For
if, existing in the Father, he knows Him in whom he exists—that is, is
not ignorant of himself—then those productions which issue from him
being his powers (faculties), and always present with him, will not be
ignorant of him who emitted them, any more than rays \[may be supposed
to be\] of the sun. It is impossible, therefore, that the Sophia
(wisdom) of God, she who is within the Pleroma, inasmuch as she has been
produced in such a manner, should have fallen under the influence of
passion, and conceived such ignorance. But it is possible that that
Sophia (wisdom) who pertains to \[the scheme\] of Valentinus, inasmuch
as she is a production of the devil, should fall into every kind of
passion, and exhibit the profoundest ignorance. For when they themselves
bear testimony concerning their mother, to the effect that she was the
offspring of an erring Æon, we need no longer search for a reason why
the sons of such a mother should be ever swimming in the depths of
ignorance.

<span id="ix.iii.xviii-p14"></span>9. I am not aware that, besides these
productions \[which have been mentioned\], they are able to speak of any
other; indeed, they have not been known to me (although I have had very
frequent discussions with them concerning forms of this kind) as ever
setting forth any other peculiar kind of being as produced \[in the
manner under consideration\]. This only they maintain, that each one of
these *was so produced* as to know merely that one who produced him,
while he was ignorant of the one who immediately preceded. But they do
not in this matter go forward \[in their account\] with any kind of
demonstration as to the manner in which these were produced, or how such
a thing could take place among spiritual beings. For, in whatsoever way
they may choose to go forward, they will feel themselves bound (while,
as regards the truth, they depart <span
id="fr_3077"></span>[3078](#fn_3077) entirely from right reason.md) to
proceed so far as to maintain that their Word, who springs from the Nous
of the Propator, —to maintain, I say, that he was produced in a state of
degeneracy. For \[they hold\] that perfect Nous, previously begotten by
the perfect Bythus, was not capable of rendering that production which
issued from him perfect, but \[could only bring it forth\] utterly blind
to the knowledge and greatness of the Father. They also maintain that
the Saviour exhibited an emblem of this mystery in the case of that man
who was blind from his birth, <span id="fr_3078"></span>[3079](#fn_3078.md)
since the Æon was in this manner produced by Monogenes blind, that is,
in ignorance, thus falsely ascribing ignorance and blindness to the Word
of God, who, according to their own theory, holds the second \[place
of\] production from the Propator. Admirable sophists, and explorers of
the sublimities of the unknown Father, and rehearsers of those
super-celestial mysteries “which the angels desire to look into!” <span
id="fr_3079"></span>[3080](#fn_3079.md) —that they may learn that from the
Nous of that Father who is above all, the Word was produced *blind*,
that is, ignorant of the Father who produced him!

<span id="ix.iii.xviii-p18"></span> <span id="page_383">p. 383</span>
<span id="ix.iii.xviii-Page_383"></span> 10. But, ye miserable sophists,
how could the Nous of the Father, or rather the very Father Himself,
since He is Nous and perfect in all things, have produced his own Logos
as an imperfect and blind Æon, when He was able also to produce along
with him the knowledge of the Father? As ye affirm that Christ was
generated <span id="fr_3080"></span>[3081](#fn_3080.md) after the rest, and
yet declare that he was produced perfect, much more then should Logos,
who is anterior to him in age, be produced by the same Nous,
unquestionably perfect, and not blind; nor could he, again, have
produced Æons still blinder than himself, until at last your Sophia,
always utterly blinded, gave birth to so vast a body of evils. And your
Father is the cause of all this mischief; for ye declare the magnitude
and power of your Father to be the causes of ignorance, assimilating Him
to Bythus, and assigning this as a name to Him who is the unnameable
Father. But if ignorance is an evil, and ye declare all evils to have
derived their strength from it, while ye maintain that the greatness and
power of the Father is the cause of this ignorance, ye do thus set Him
forth as the author of \[all\] evils. For ye state as the cause of evil
this fact, that \[no one\] could contemplate His greatness. But if it
was really impossible for the Father to make Himself known from the
beginning to those \[beings\] that were formed by Him, He must in that
case be held free from blame, inasmuch as He *could not* remove the
ignorance of those who came after Him. But if, at a subsequent period,
when He so willed it, He *could* take away that ignorance which had
increased with the successive productions as they followed each other,
and thus become deeply seated in the Æons, much more, had He so willed
it might He formerly have prevented that ignorance, which as yet was
not, from coming into existence.

<span id="ix.iii.xviii-p20"></span>11. Since therefore, as soon as He so
pleased, He did become known not only to the Æons, but also to these men
who lived in these latter times; but, as He did not so please to be
known from the beginning, He remained unknown—the cause of ignorance is,
according to you, the will of the Father. For if He foreknew that these
things would in future happen in such a manner, why then did He not
guard against the ignorance of these beings before it had obtained a
place among them, rather than afterwards, as if under the influence of
repentance, deal with it through the production of Christ? For the
knowledge which through Christ He conveyed to all, He might long before
have imparted through Logos, who was also the first-begotten of
Monogenes. Or if, knowing them beforehand, He willed that these things
should happen \[as they have done\], then the works of ignorance must
endure for ever, and never pass away. For the things which have been
made in accordance with the will of your Propator must continue along
with the will of Him who willed them; or if they pass away, the will of
Him also who decreed that they should have a being will pass away along
with them. And why did the Æons find rest and attain perfect knowledge
through learning \[at last\] that the Father is altogether <span
id="fr_3081"></span>[3082](#fn_3081.md) incomprehensible? They might surely
have possessed this knowledge before they became involved in passion;
for the greatness of the Father did not suffer diminution from the
beginning, so that these might <span
id="fr_3082"></span>[3083](#fn_3082.md) know that He was altogether
incomprehensible. For if, on account of His infinite greatness, He
remained unknown, He ought also on account of His infinite love to have
preserved those impassible who were produced by Him, since nothing
hindered, and expediency rather required, that they should have known
from the beginning that the Father was altogether incomprehensible.
