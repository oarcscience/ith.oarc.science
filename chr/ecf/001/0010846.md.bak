### <span id="ix.vii.ix-p0.1"></span>Chapter VIII.—The gifts of the Holy Spirit which we receive prepare us for incorruption, render us spiritual, and separate us from carnal men. These two classes are signified by the clean and unclean animals in the legal dispensation.

<span id="ix.vii.ix-p1"></span>1. <span id="ix.vii.ix-p1.1"></span><span
id="ix.vii.ix-p1.2"></span>But we do now receive a certain portion of
His Spirit, tending towards perfection, and preparing us for
incorruption, being little by little accustomed to receive and bear God;
which also the apostle terms “an earnest,” that is, a part of the honour
which has been promised us by God, where he says in the Epistle to the
Ephesians, “In which ye also, having heard the word of truth, the Gospel
of your salvation, believing in which we have been sealed with the Holy
Spirit of promise, which is the earnest of our inheritance.” <span
id="fr_4494"></span>[4495](#fn_4494.md) <span
id="ix.vii.ix-p2.2"></span><span id="ix.vii.ix-p2.3"></span>This
earnest, therefore, thus dwelling in us, renders us spiritual even now,
and the mortal is swallowed up by immortality. <span
id="fr_4495"></span>[4496](#fn_4495.md) “For ye,” he declares, “are not in
the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in
you.” <span id="fr_4496"></span>[4497](#fn_4496.md) This, however does not
take place by a casting away of the flesh, but by the impartation of the
Spirit. For those to whom he was writing were not without flesh, but
they were those who had received the Spirit of God, “by which we cry,
Abba, Father.” <span id="fr_4497"></span>[4498](#fn_4497.md) If therefore,
at the present time, having the earnest, we do cry, “Abba, Father,” what
shall it be when, on rising again, we behold Him face to face; when all
the members shall burst out into a continuous hymn of triumph,
glorifying Him who raised them from the dead, and gave the gift of
eternal life? For if the earnest, gathering man into itself, does even
now cause him to cry, “Abba, Father,” what shall the complete grace of
the Spirit effect, which shall be given to men by God? It will render us
like unto Him, and accomplish the will <span
id="fr_4498"></span>[4499](#fn_4498.md) of the Father; for it shall make
man after the image and likeness of God.

<span id="ix.vii.ix-p7"></span> <span id="page_534">p. 534</span> <span
id="ix.vii.ix-Page_534"></span> 2. Those persons, then, who possess the
earnest of the Spirit, and who are not enslaved by the lusts of the
flesh, but are subject to the Spirit, and who in all things walk
according to the light of reason, does the apostle properly term
“spiritual,” because the Spirit of God dwells in them. Now, spiritual
men shall not be incorporeal spirits; but our substance, that is, the
union of flesh and spirit, receiving the Spirit of God, makes up the
spiritual man. But those who do indeed reject the Spirit’s counsel, and
are the slaves of fleshly lusts, and lead lives contrary to reason, and
who, without restraint, plunge headlong into their own desires, having
no longing after the Divine Spirit, do live after the manner of swine
and of dogs; these men, \[I say\], does the apostle very properly term
“carnal,” because they have no thought of anything else except carnal
things.

<span id="ix.vii.ix-p8"></span>3. For the same reason, too, do the
prophets compare them to irrational animals, on account of the
irrationality of their conduct, saying, “They have become as horses
raging for the females; each one of them neighing after his neighbour’s
wife.” <span id="fr_4499"></span>[4500](#fn_4499.md) And again, “Man, when
he was in honour, was made like unto cattle.” <span
id="fr_4500"></span>[4501](#fn_4500.md) This denotes that, for his own
fault, he is likened to cattle, by rivalling their irrational life. And
we also, as the custom is, do designate men of this stamp as cattle and
irrational beasts.

<span id="ix.vii.ix-p11"></span>4. <span
id="ix.vii.ix-p11.1"></span><span id="ix.vii.ix-p11.2"></span>Now the
law has figuratively predicted all these, delineating man by the
\[various\] animals: <span id="fr_4501"></span>[4502](#fn_4501.md)
whatsoever of these, says \[the Scripture\], have a double hoof and
ruminate, it proclaims as clean; but whatsoever of them do not possess
one or other of these \[properties\], it sets aside by themselves as
unclean. Who then are the clean? Those who make their way by faith
steadily towards the Father and the Son; for this is denoted by the
steadiness of those which divide the hoof; and they meditate day and
night upon the words of God, <span id="fr_4502"></span>[4503](#fn_4502.md)
that they may be adorned with good works: for this is the meaning of the
ruminants. The unclean, however, are those which do neither divide the
hoof nor ruminate; that is, those persons who have neither faith in God,
nor do meditate on His words: and such is the abomination of the
Gentiles. But as to those animals which do indeed chew the cud, but have
not the double hoof, and are themselves unclean, we have in them a
figurative description of the Jews, who certainly have the words of God
in their mouth, but who do not fix their rooted stedfastness in the
Father and in the Son; wherefore they are an unstable generation. For
those animals which have the hoof all in one piece easily slip; but
those which have it divided are more sure-footed, their cleft hoofs
succeeding each other as they advance, and the one hoof supporting the
other. In like manner, too, those are unclean which have the double hoof
but do not ruminate: this is plainly an indication of all heretics, and
of those who do not meditate on the words of God, neither are adorned
with works of righteousness; to whom also the Lord says, “Why call ye Me
Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say to you?” <span
id="fr_4503"></span>[4504](#fn_4503.md) For men of this stamp do indeed say
that they believe in the Father and the Son, but they never meditate as
they should upon the things of God, neither are they adorned with works
of righteousness; but, as I have already observed, they have adopted the
lives of swine and of dogs, giving themselves over to filthiness, to
gluttony, and recklessness of all sorts. Justly, therefore, did the
apostle call all such “carnal” and “animal,” <span
id="fr_4504"></span>[4505](#fn_4504.md) —\[all those, namely\], who through
their own unbelief and luxury do not receive the Divine Spirit, and in
their various phases cast out from themselves the life-giving Word, and
walk stupidly after their own lusts: the prophets, too, spake of them as
beasts of burden and wild beasts; custom likewise has viewed them in the
light of cattle and irrational creatures; and the law has pronounced
them unclean.
