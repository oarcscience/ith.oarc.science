### <span id="viii.ii.xxxiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXIII.—Manner of Christ’s birth predicted.

<span id="viii.ii.xxxiii-p1"></span><span
id="viii.ii.xxxiii-p1.1"></span><span
id="viii.ii.xxxiii-p1.2"></span><span
id="viii.ii.xxxiii-p1.3"></span>And hear again how Isaiah in express
words foretold that He should be born of a virgin; for he spoke thus:
“Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bring forth a son, and they shall
say for His name, ‘God with us.’ ” <span
id="fr_1829"></span>[1830](#fn_1829.md) For things which were incredible
and seemed impossible with men, these God predicted by the Spirit of
prophecy as about to come to pass, in order that, when they came to
pass, there might be no unbelief, but faith, because of their
prediction. But lest some, not understanding the prophecy now cited,
should charge us with the very things we have been laying to the charge
of the poets who say that Jupiter went in to women through lust, let us
try to explain the words. This, then, “Behold, a virgin shall conceive,”
signifies that a virgin should conceive without intercourse. For if she
had had intercourse with any one whatever, she was no longer a virgin;
but the power of God having come upon the virgin, overshadowed her, and
caused her while yet a virgin to conceive. And the angel of God who was
sent to the same virgin at that time brought her good news, saying,
“Behold, thou shalt conceive of the Holy Ghost, and shalt bear a Son,
and He shall be called the Son of the Highest, and thou shalt call His
name Jesus; for He shall save His people from their sins,” <span
id="fr_1830"></span>[1831](#fn_1830.md) —as they who have recorded all that
concerns our Saviour Jesus Christ have taught, whom we believed, since
by Isaiah also, whom we have now adduced, the Spirit of prophecy
declared that He should be born as we intimated before. <span
id="viii.ii.xxxiii-p3.3"></span>It is wrong, therefore, to understand
the Spirit and the power of God as anything else than the Word, who is
also the first-born of God, as the foresaid prophet Moses declared; and
it was this which, when it came upon the virgin and overshadowed her,
caused her to conceive, not by intercourse, but by power. And the name
Jesus in the Hebrew language means <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.ii.xxxiii-p3.4"></span>Σωτήρ</span> (Saviour) in the Greek
tongue. Wherefore, too, the angel said to the virgin, “Thou shalt call
His name Jesus, for He shall save His people from their sins.” And that
the prophets are inspired <span id="fr_1831"></span>[1832](#fn_1831.md) by
no other than the Divine Word, even you, as I fancy, will grant.
