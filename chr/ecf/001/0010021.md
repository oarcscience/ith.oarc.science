### <span id="ii.ii.xvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVI.—Christ as an example of humility.

<span id="ii.ii.xvi-p1"></span><span id="ii.ii.xvi-p1.1"></span><span
id="ii.ii.xvi-p1.2"></span><span id="ii.ii.xvi-p1.3"></span><span
id="ii.ii.xvi-p1.4"></span><span id="ii.ii.xvi-p1.5"></span><span
id="ii.ii.xvi-p1.6"></span>For Christ is of those who are humble-minded,
and not of those who exalt themselves over His flock. Our Lord Jesus
Christ, the Sceptre of the majesty of God, did not come in the pomp of
pride or arrogance, although He might have done so, but in a lowly
condition, as the Holy Spirit had declared regarding Him. For He says,
“Lord, who hath believed our report, and to whom is the arm of the Lord
revealed? We have declared \[our message\] in His presence: He is, as it
were, a child, and like a root in thirsty ground; He has no form nor
glory, yea, we saw Him, and He had no form nor comeliness; but His form
was without eminence, yea, deficient in comparison with the \[ordinary\]
form of men. He is a man exposed to stripes and suffering, and
acquainted with the endurance of grief: for His countenance was turned
away; He was despised, and not esteemed. He bears our iniquities, and is
in sorrow for our sakes; yet we supposed that \[on His own account\] He
was exposed to labour, and stripes, and affliction. But He was wounded
for our transgressions, and bruised for our iniquities. The chastisement
of our peace was upon Him, and by His stripes we were healed. All we,
like sheep, have gone astray; \[every\] man has wandered in his own way;
and the Lord has delivered Him up for our sins, while He in the midst of
His sufferings openeth not His mouth. He was brought as a sheep to the
slaughter, and as a lamb before her shearer is dumb, so He openeth not
His mouth. In His humiliation His judgment was taken away; who shall
declare His generation? for His life is taken from the earth. For the
transgressions of my people was He brought down to death. And I will
give the wicked for His sepulchre, and the rich for His death, <span
id="fr_65"></span>[66](#fn_65) because He did no iniquity, neither was
guile found in His mouth. And the Lord is pleased to purify Him by
stripes. <span id="fr_66"></span>[67](#fn_66) If ye make <span
id="fr_67"></span>[68](#fn_67) an offering for sin, your soul shall see
a long-lived seed. And the Lord is pleased to relieve Him of the
affliction of His soul, to show Him light, and to form Him with
understanding, <span id="fr_68"></span>[69](#fn_68) to justify the Just
One who ministereth well to many; and He Himself shall carry their sins.
On this account He shall inherit many, and shall divide the spoil of the
strong; because His soul was delivered to death, and He was reckoned
among the transgressors, and He bare the sins of many, and for their
sins was He delivered.” <span id="fr_69"></span>[70](#fn_69) And again
He saith, “I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of
the people. All that see Me have derided Me; they have spoken with their
lips; they have wagged their head, \[saying\] He hoped in God, let Him
deliver Him, let Him save Him, since He delighteth in Him.” <span
id="fr_70"></span>[71](#fn_70) Ye see, beloved, what is the example
which has been given us; for if the Lord thus humbled Himself, what
shall we do who have through Him come under the yoke of His grace?

<span id="ii.ii.xvi-p2"></span> The Latin of Cotelerius, adopted by
Hefele and Dressel, translates this clause as follows: “I will set free
the wicked on account of His sepulchre, and the rich on account of His
death.”

<span id="fn_66"></span>[9:67](0010021.htm#fr_66) <span
id="ii.ii.xvi-p2.1"></span>

<span id="ii.ii.xvi-p3"></span> The reading of the <span
class="upper"><span id="ii.ii.xvi-p3.1"></span>ms.</span> is <span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.ii.xvi-p3.2"></span>τῆς πληγῆς</span>,
“purify, or free, Him from stripes.” We have adopted the emendation of
Junius.

<span id="fn_67"></span>[9:68](0010021.htm#fr_67) <span
id="ii.ii.xvi-p3.3"></span>

<span id="ii.ii.xvi-p4"></span> Wotton reads, “If He make.”

<span id="fn_68"></span>[9:69](0010021.htm#fr_68) <span
id="ii.ii.xvi-p4.1"></span>

<span id="ii.ii.xvi-p5"></span> Or, “*fill* Him with understanding,” if
<span class="Greek"><span id="ii.ii.xvi-p5.1"></span>πλῆσαι</span>
should be read instead of <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.ii.xvi-p5.2"></span>πλάσαι</span>, as Grabe suggests.

<span id="fn_69"></span>[9:70](0010021.htm#fr_69) <span

The reader will observe how often the text of the Septuagint, here
quoted, differs from the Hebrew as represented by our authorized English
version.
