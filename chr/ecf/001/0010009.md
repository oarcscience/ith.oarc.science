### <span id="ii.ii.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.—Many evils have already flowed from this source in ancient times.

<span id="ii.ii.iv-p1"></span><span id="ii.ii.iv-p1.1"></span><span
id="ii.ii.iv-p1.2"></span><span id="ii.ii.iv-p1.3"></span><span
id="ii.ii.iv-p1.4"></span><span id="ii.ii.iv-p1.5"></span><span
id="ii.ii.iv-p1.6"></span>For thus it is written: “And it came to pass
after certain days, that Cain brought of the fruits of the earth a
sacrifice unto God; and Abel also brought of the firstlings of his
sheep, and of the fat thereof. And God had respect to Abel and to his
offerings, but Cain and his sacrifices He did not regard. And Cain was
deeply grieved, and his countenance fell. And God said to Cain, Why art
thou grieved, and why is try countenance fallen? If thou offerest
rightly, but dost not divide rightly, hast thou not sinned? Be at peace:
thine offering returns to thyself, and thou shalt again possess it. And
Cain said to Abel his brother, Let us go into the field. And it came to
pass, while they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his
brother, and slew him.” <span id="fr_17"></span>[18](#fn_17.md) Ye see,
brethren, how envy and jealousy led to the murder of a brother. Through
envy, also, our father Jacob fled from the face of Esau his
brother. <span id="fr_18"></span>[19](#fn_18.md) Envy made Joseph be
persecuted unto death, and to come into bondage. <span
id="fr_19"></span>[20](#fn_19.md) <span id="ii.ii.iv-p4.2"></span>Envy
compelled Moses to flee from the face of Pharaoh king of Egypt, when he
heard these words from his fellow-countryman, “Who made thee a judge or
a ruler over us? wilt thou kill me, as thou didst kill the Egyptian
yesterday?” <span id="fr_20"></span>[21](#fn_20.md) On account of envy,
Aaron and Miriam had to make their abode without the camp. <span
id="fr_21"></span>[22](#fn_21.md) Envy brought down Dathan and Abiram alive
to Hades, through the sedition which they excited against God’s servant
Moses. <span id="fr_22"></span>[23](#fn_22.md) Through envy, David
underwent the hatred not only of foreigners, but was also persecuted by
Saul king of Israel. <span id="fr_23"></span>[24](#fn_23.md)

The writer here, as always, follows the reading of the Septuagint, which
in this passage both alters and adds to the Hebrew text. We have given
the rendering approved by the best critics; but some prefer to
translate, as in our English version, “unto thee shall be his desire,
and thou shalt rule over him.” See, for an ancient explanation of the
passage, Irenæus, *Adv. Hær.*, iv. 18, 3.
