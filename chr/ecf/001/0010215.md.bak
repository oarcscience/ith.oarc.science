### <span id="v.viii.ii-p0.1"></span>Chapter II.—Exhortations.

<span id="v.viii.ii-p1"></span>If thou lovest the good disciples, no
thanks are due to thee on that account; but rather seek by meekness to
subdue the more troublesome. Every kind of wound is not healed with the
same plaster. Mitigate violent <span id="page_94">p. 94</span> <span
id="v.viii.ii-Page_94"></span> attacks \[of disease\] by gentle
applications. <span id="fr_1071"></span>[1072](#fn_1071.md) Be in all
things “wise as a serpent, and harmless as a dove.” <span
id="fr_1072"></span>[1073](#fn_1072.md) For this purpose thou art composed
of both flesh and spirit, that thou mayest deal tenderly <span
id="fr_1073"></span>[1074](#fn_1073.md) with those \[evils\] that present
themselves visibly before thee. And as respects those that are not
seen, <span id="fr_1074"></span>[1075](#fn_1074.md) pray that \[God\] would
reveal them unto thee, in order that thou mayest be wanting in nothing,
but mayest abound in every gift. The times call for thee, as pilots do
for the winds, and as one tossed with tempest seeks for the haven, so
that both thou \[and those under thy care\] may attain to God. <span
id="v.viii.ii-p5.1"></span>Be sober as an athlete of God: the prize set
before thee is immortality and eternal life, of which thou art also
persuaded. In all things may my soul be for thine, <span
id="fr_1075"></span>[1076](#fn_1075.md) and my bonds also, which thou hast
loved.

<span id="v.viii.ii-p7"></span>If thou lovest the good disciples, no
thanks are due to thee on that account; but rather seek by meekness to
subdue the more troublesome. Every kind of wound is not healed with the
same plaster. Mitigate violent attacks \[of disease\] by gentle
applications. <span id="fr_1076"></span>[1077](#fn_1076.md) Be in all
things “wise as a serpent, and harmless always as a dove.” <span
id="fr_1077"></span>[1078](#fn_1077.md) For this purpose thou art composed
of both soul and body, art both fleshly and spiritual, that thou mayest
correct those \[evils\] that present themselves visibly before thee; and
as respects those that are not seen, mayest pray that these should be
revealed to thee, so that thou mayest be wanting in nothing, but mayest
abound in every gift. The times call upon thee to pray. For as the wind
aids the pilot of a ship, and as havens are advantageous for safety to a
tempest-tossed vessel, so is also prayer to thee, in order that thou
mayest attain to God. <span id="v.viii.ii-p9.2"></span>Be sober as an
athlete of God, whose will is immortality and eternal life; of which
thou art also persuaded. In all things may my soul be for thine, <span
id="fr_1078"></span>[1079](#fn_1078.md) and my bonds also, which thou hast
loved.
