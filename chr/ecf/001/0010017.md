### <span id="ii.ii.xii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XII.—The rewards of faith and hospitality. Rahab.

<span id="ii.ii.xii-p1"></span><span id="ii.ii.xii-p1.1"></span><span
id="ii.ii.xii-p1.2"></span><span id="ii.ii.xii-p1.3"></span>On account
of her faith and hospitality, Rahab the harlot was saved. For when spies
were sent by Joshua, the son of Nun, to Jericho, the king of the country
ascertained that they were come to spy out their land, and sent men to
seize them, in order that, when taken, they might be put to death. But
the hospitable Rahab receiving them, concealed them on the roof of her
house under some stalks of flax. And when the men sent by the king
arrived and said “There came men unto thee who are to spy out our land;
bring them forth, for so the king commands,” she answered them, “The two
men whom ye seek came unto me, but quickly departed again and are gone,”
thus not discovering the spies to them. Then she said to the men, “I
know assuredly that the Lord your God hath given you this city, for the
fear and dread of you have fallen on its inhabitants. When therefore ye
shall have taken it, keep ye me and the house of my father in safety.”
And they said to her, “It shall be as thou hast spoken to us. As soon,
therefore, as thou knowest that we are at hand, thou shall gather all
thy family under thy roof, and they shall be preserved, but all that are
found outside of thy dwelling shall perish.” <span

effect, that she should hang forth from her house a scarlet thread. And
thus they made it manifest that redemption should flow through the blood
of the Lord to all them that believe and hope in God. <span
id="fr_53"></span>[54](#fn_53) Ye see, beloved, that there was not only
faith, but prophecy, in this woman.

<span id="ii.ii.xii-p3"></span> Others of the Fathers adopt the same
allegorical interpretation, e.g., Justin Mar., *Dial. c. Tryph.*, n.
111; Irenæus, *Adv. Hær.*, iv. 20. \[The whole matter of symbolism under
the law must be more thoroughly studied if we would account for such
strong language as is here applied to a poetical or rhetorical figure.\]
