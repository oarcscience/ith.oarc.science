### <span id="v.xiv.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.—Continuation.

<span id="v.xiv.vi-p1"></span>Nor is He a mere man, by whom and in whom
all things were made; for “all things were made by Him.” <span
id="fr_1195"></span>[1196](#fn_1195) “When He made the heaven, I was
present with Him; and I was there with Him, forming \[the world along
with Him\], and He rejoiced in me daily.” <span
id="fr_1196"></span>[1197](#fn_1196) And how could a mere man be
addressed in such words as these: “Sit Thou at My right hand?” <span
id="fr_1197"></span>[1198](#fn_1197) And how, again, could such an one
declare: “Before Abraham was, I am?” <span
id="fr_1198"></span>[1199](#fn_1198) And, “Glorify Me with Thy glory
which I had before the world was?” <span
id="fr_1199"></span>[1200](#fn_1199) What man could ever say, “I came
down from heaven, not to do Mine own will, but the will of Him that sent
Me?” <span id="fr_1200"></span>[1201](#fn_1200) And of what man could it
be said, “He was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh
into the world: He was in the world, and the world was made by Him, and
the world knew Him not. He came unto His own, and His own received Him
not?” <span id="fr_1201"></span>[1202](#fn_1201) How could such a one be
a mere man, receiving the beginning of His existence from Mary, and not
rather God the Word, and the only-begotten Son? For “in the beginning
was the Word, and the Word was with God, <span
id="fr_1202"></span>[1203](#fn_1202) and the Word was God.” <span
id="fr_1203"></span>[1204](#fn_1203) And in another place, “The Lord
created Me, the beginning of His ways, for His ways, for His works.
Before the world did He found Me, and before all the hills did He beget
Me.” <span id="fr_1204"></span>[1205](#fn_1204)
