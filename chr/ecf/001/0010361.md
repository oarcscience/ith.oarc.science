### <span id="vii.ii.i-p0.1"></span>I. From the exposition of the oracles of the Lord. <span id="fr_1733"></span>[1734](#fn_1733.md)

<span id="vii.ii.i-p2"></span>\[<span class="upper"><span
id="vii.ii.i-p2.1"></span>The</span> writings of Papias in common
circulation are five in number, and these are called an Exposition of
the Oracles of the Lord. Irenæus makes mention of these as the only
works written by him, in the following words: “Now testimony is borne to
these things in writing by Papias, an ancient man, who was a hearer of
John, and a friend of Polycarp, in the fourth of his books; for five
books were composed by him.” Thus wrote Irenæus. Moreover, Papias
himself, in the introduction to his books, makes it manifest that he was
not himself a hearer and eye-witness of the holy apostles; but he tells
us that he received the truths of our religion <span
id="fr_1734"></span>[1735](#fn_1734.md) from those who were acquainted with
them \[the apostles\] in the following words:\]

<span id="vii.ii.i-p4"></span>But I shall not be unwilling to put down,
along with my interpretations, <span
id="fr_1735"></span>[1736](#fn_1735.md) whatsoever instructions I received
with care at any time from the elders, and stored up with care in my
memory, assuring you at the same time of their truth. For I did not,
like the multitude, take pleasure in those who spoke much, but in those
who taught the truth; nor in those who related strange
commandments, <span id="fr_1736"></span>[1737](#fn_1736.md) but in those
who rehearsed the commandments given by the Lord to faith, <span
id="fr_1737"></span>[1738](#fn_1737.md) and proceeding from truth itself.
If, then, any one who had attended on the elders came, I asked minutely
after their sayings,—what Andrew or Peter said, or what was said by
Philip, or by Thomas, or by James, or by John, or by Matthew, or by any
other of the Lord’s disciples: which things <span
id="fr_1738"></span>[1739](#fn_1738.md) Aristion and the presbyter John,
the disciples of the Lord, say. For I imagined that what was to be got
from books was not so profitable to me as what came from the living and
abiding voice.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1733"></span>[153:1734](0010361.htm#fr_1733.md) <span
id="vii.ii.i-p0.2"></span>

<span id="vii.ii.i-p1"></span> This fragment is found in Eusebius,
*Hist. Eccl.* iii. 39.

<span id="fn_1734"></span>[153:1735](0010361.htm#fr_1734.md) <span
id="vii.ii.i-p2.2"></span>

<span id="vii.ii.i-p3"></span> Literally, “the things of faith.”

<span id="fn_1735"></span>[153:1736](0010361.htm#fr_1735.md) <span
id="vii.ii.i-p4.1"></span>

<span id="vii.ii.i-p5"></span> Papias states that he will give an exact
account of what the elders said; and that, in addition to this, he will
accompany this account with an explanation of the meaning and import of
the statements.

<span id="fn_1736"></span>[153:1737](0010361.htm#fr_1736.md) <span
id="vii.ii.i-p5.1"></span>

<span id="vii.ii.i-p6"></span> Literally, “commandments belonging to
others,” and therefore strange and novel to the followers of Christ.

<span id="fn_1737"></span>[153:1738](0010361.htm#fr_1737.md) <span
id="vii.ii.i-p6.1"></span>

<span id="vii.ii.i-p7"></span> *Given to faith* has been variously
understood. Either not stated in direct language, but like parables
given in figures, so that only the faithful could understand; or
entrusted to faith, that is, to those who were possessed of faith, the
faithful.

<span id="fn_1738"></span>[153:1739](0010361.htm#fr_1738.md) <span
id="vii.ii.i-p7.1"></span>

<span id="vii.ii.i-p8"></span> *Which things*: this is usually
translated, “what Aristion and John say;” and the translation is
admissible. But the words more naturally mean, that John and Aristion,
even at the time of his writing, were telling him some of the sayings of
the Lord.
