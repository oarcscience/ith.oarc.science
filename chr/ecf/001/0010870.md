### <span id="ix.vii.xxxiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXII.—In that flesh in which the saints have suffered so many afflictions, they shall receive the fruits of their labours; especially since all creation waits for this, and God promises it to Abraham and his seed.

<span id="ix.vii.xxxiii-p1"></span>1. Inasmuch, therefore, as the
opinions of certain \[orthodox persons\] are derived from heretical
discourses, they are both ignorant of God’s dispensations, and of the
mystery of the resurrection of the just, and of the \[earthly\] kingdom
which is the commencement of incorruption, by means of which kingdom
those who shall be worthy are accustomed gradually to partake of the
divine nature (*capere Deum* <span id="fr_4719"></span>[4720](#fn_4719.md)
); and it is necessary to tell them respecting those things, that it
behoves the righteous first to receive the promise of the inheritance
which God promised to the fathers, and to reign in it, when they rise
again to behold God in this creation which is renovated, and that the
judgment should take place afterwards. <span
id="ix.vii.xxxiii-p2.1"></span>For it is just that in that very creation
in which they toiled or were afflicted, being proved in every way by
suffering, they should receive the reward of their suffering; and that
in the creation in which they were slain because of their love to God,
in that they should be revived again; and that in the creation in which
they endured servitude, in that they should reign. For God is rich in
all things, and all things are His. It is fitting, therefore, that the
creation itself, being restored to its primeval condition, should
without restraint be under the dominion of the righteous; and the
apostle has made this plain in the Epistle to the Romans, when he thus
speaks: “For the expectation of the creature waiteth for the
manifestation of the sons of God. For the creature has been subjected to
vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same
in hope; since the creature itself shall also be delivered from the
bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the sons of
God.” <span id="fr_4720"></span>[4721](#fn_4720.md)

<span id="ix.vii.xxxiii-p4"></span>2. Thus, then, the promise of God,
which He gave to Abraham, remains stedfast. For thus He said: “Lift up
thine eyes, and look from this place where now thou art, towards the
north and south, and east and west. For all the earth which thou seest,
I will give to thee and to thy seed, even for ever.” <span
id="fr_4721"></span>[4722](#fn_4721.md) And again He says, “Arise, and go
through the length and breadth of the land, since I will give it unto
thee;” <span id="fr_4722"></span>[4723](#fn_4722.md) and \[yet\] he did not
receive an inheritance in it, not even a footstep, but was always a
stranger and a pilgrim therein. <span
id="fr_4723"></span>[4724](#fn_4723.md) And upon the death of Sarah his
wife, when the Hittites were willing to bestow upon him a place where he
might bury her, he declined it as a gift, but bought the burying-place
(giving for it four hundred talents of silver) from Ephron the son of
Zohar the Hittite. <span id="fr_4724"></span>[4725](#fn_4724.md) <span
id="ix.vii.xxxiii-p8.2"></span>Thus did he await patiently the promise
of God, and was unwilling to appear to receive from men, what God had
promised to give him, when He said again to him as follows: “I will give
this land to thy seed, from the river of Egypt even unto the great river
Euphrates.” <span id="fr_4725"></span>[4726](#fn_4725.md) If, then, God
promised him the inheritance of the land, yet he did not receive it
during all the time of his sojourn there, it must be, that together with
his seed, that is, those who fear God and believe in Him, he shall
receive it at the resurrection of the just. For his seed is the Church,
which receives the adoption to God through the Lord, as John the Baptist
said: “For God is able from the stones to raise up children to
Abraham.” <span id="fr_4726"></span>[4727](#fn_4726.md) Thus also the
apostle says in the Epistle to the Galatians: “But ye, brethren, as
Isaac was, are the children of the promise.” <span
id="fr_4727"></span>[4728](#fn_4727.md) And again, in the same Epistle, he
plainly declares that they who have believed in Christ do receive
Christ, the promise to Abraham thus saying, “The promises were spoken to
Abraham, and to his seed. Now He does not say, And of seeds, as if \[He
spake\] of many, but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.” <span
id="fr_4728"></span>[4729](#fn_4728.md) And again, confirming his former
words, he says, “Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to
him for righteousness. Know ye therefore, that they which are of faith
are the children of Abraham. But the Scripture, foreseeing that God
would justify the heathen through faith, declared to Abraham beforehand,
That in thee shall all nations be blessed. So then they which are of
faith shall be blessed with faithful Abraham.” <span
id="fr_4729"></span>[4730](#fn_4729.md) Thus, then, they who are of faith
shall be blessed with faithful Abraham, and these are the children of
Abraham. Now God made promise of the earth to Abraham and his seed; yet
neither Abraham nor his seed, that is, those who are justified by faith,
do now receive any <span id="page_562">p. 562</span> <span
id="ix.vii.xxxiii-Page_562"></span> inheritance in it; but they shall
receive it at the resurrection of the just. For God is true and
faithful; and on this account He said, “Blessed are the meek, for they
shall inherit the earth.” <span id="fr_4730"></span>[4731](#fn_4730.md)
