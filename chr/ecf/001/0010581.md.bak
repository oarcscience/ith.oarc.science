### <span id="viii.iv.cxx-p0.1"></span>Chapter CXX.—Christians were promised to Isaac, Jacob, and Judah.

<span id="viii.iv.cxx-p1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.cxx-p1.1"></span>“Observe, too, how the same promises are
made to Isaac and to Jacob. For thus He speaks to Isaac: ‘And in thy
seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.’ <span
id="fr_2405"></span>[2406](#fn_2405.md) And to Jacob: ‘And in thee and in
thy seed shall all families of the earth be blessed.’ <span
id="fr_2406"></span>[2407](#fn_2406.md) He says that neither to Esau nor to
Reuben, nor to any other; only to those of whom the Christ should arise,
according to the dispensation, through the Virgin Mary. But if you would
consider the blessing of Judah, you would perceive what I say. For the
seed is divided from Jacob, and comes down through Judah, and Phares,
and Jesse, and David. And this was a symbol of the fact that some of
your nation would be found children of Abraham, and found, too, in the
lot of Christ; but that others, who are indeed children of Abraham,
would be like the sand on the sea-shore, barren and fruitless, much in
quantity, and without number indeed, but bearing no fruit whatever, and
only drinking the water of the sea. And a vast multitude in your nation
are convicted of being of this kind, imbibing doctrines of bitterness
and godlessness, but spurning the word of God. He speaks therefore in
the passage relating to Judah: ‘A prince shall not fail from Judah, nor
a ruler from his thighs, till that which is laid up for him come; and He
shall be the expectation of the nations.’ <span
id="fr_2407"></span>[2408](#fn_2407.md) And it is plain that this was
spoken not of Judah, but of Christ. For all we out of all nations do
expect not Judah, but Jesus, who led your fathers out of Egypt. For the
prophecy referred even to the advent of Christ: ‘Till He come for whom
this is laid up, and He shall be the expectation of nations.’ Jesus
came, therefore, as we have shown at length, and is expected again to
appear above the clouds; whose name you profane, and labour hard to get
it profaned over all the earth. It were possible for me, sirs,” I
continued, “to contend against you about the reading which you so
interpret, saying it is written, ‘Till the things laid up for Him come;’
though the Seventy have not so explained it, but thus, ‘Till He comes
for whom this is laid up.’ But since what follows indicates that the
reference is to Christ (for it is, ‘and He shall be the expectation of
nations’), I do not proceed to have a mere verbal controversy with you,
as I have not attempted to establish proof about Christ from the
passages of Scripture which are not admitted by you <span
id="fr_2408"></span>[2409](#fn_2408.md) which I quoted from the words of
Jeremiah the prophet, and Esdras, and David; but from those which are
even now admitted by you, which had your teachers comprehended, be well
assured they would have deleted them, as they did those about the death
of Isaiah, whom you sawed asunder with a wooden saw. And this was a
mysterious type of Christ being about to cut your nation in two, and to
raise those worthy of the honour to the everlasting kingdom along with
the holy patriarchs and prophets; but He has said that He will send
others to the condemnation of the unquenchable fire along with similar
disobedient and impenitent men from all the nations. ‘For they shall
come,’ He said, ‘from the west and from the east, and shall sit down
with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven; but the
children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness.’ <span
id="fr_2409"></span>[2410](#fn_2409.md) And I have mentioned <span
id="page_260">p. 260</span> <span id="viii.iv.cxx-Page_260"></span>
these things, taking nothing whatever into consideration, except the
speaking of the truth, and refusing to be coerced by any one, even
though I should be forthwith torn in pieces by you. For I gave no
thought to any of my people, that is, the Samaritans, when I had a
communication in writing with Cæsar, <span
id="fr_2410"></span>[2411](#fn_2410.md) but stated that they were wrong in
trusting to the magician Simon of their own nation, who, they say, is
God above all power, and authority, and might.”
