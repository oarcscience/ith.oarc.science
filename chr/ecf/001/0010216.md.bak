### <span id="v.viii.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.—Exhortations.

<span id="v.viii.iii-p1"></span>Let not those who seem worthy of credit,
but teach strange doctrines, <span id="fr_1079"></span>[1080](#fn_1079.md)
fill thee with apprehension. Stand firm, as does an anvil which is
beaten. It is the part of a noble <span
id="fr_1080"></span>[1081](#fn_1080.md) athlete to be wounded, and yet to
conquer. And especially, we ought to bear all things for the sake of
God, that He also may bear with us. Be ever becoming more zealous than
what thou art. Weigh carefully the times. Look for Him who is above all
time, eternal and invisible, yet who became visible for our sakes;
impalpable and impassible, yet who became passible on our account; and
who in every kind of way suffered for our sakes.

<span id="v.viii.iii-p4"></span>Let not those who seem worthy of credit,
but teach strange doctrines, <span id="fr_1081"></span>[1082](#fn_1081.md)
fill thee with apprehension. Stand firm, as does an anvil which is
beaten. It is the part of a noble <span
id="fr_1082"></span>[1083](#fn_1082.md) athlete to be wounded, and yet to
conquer. And especially we ought to bear all things for the sake of God,
that He also may bear with us, and bring us into His kingdom. Add more
and more to thy diligence; run thy race with increasing energy; weigh
carefully the times. Whilst thou art here, be a conqueror; for here is
the course, and there are the crowns. <span
id="v.viii.iii-p6.1"></span>Look for Christ, the Son of God; who was
before time, yet appeared in time; who was invisible by nature, yet
visible in the flesh; who was impalpable, and could not be touched, as
being without a body, but for our sakes became such, might be touched
and handled in the body; who was impassible as God, but became passible
for our sakes as man; and who in every kind of way suffered for our
sakes.
