### <span id="viii.iv.lii-p0.1"></span>Chapter LII.—Jacob predicted two advents of Christ.

<span id="viii.iv.lii-p1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.lii-p1.1"></span><span id="viii.iv.lii-p1.2"></span><span
id="viii.iv.lii-p1.3"></span><span id="viii.iv.lii-p1.4"></span>“And it
was prophesied by Jacob the patriarch <span
id="fr_2111"></span>[2112](#fn_2111.md) that there would be two advents of
Christ, and that in the first He would suffer, and that after He came
there would be neither prophet nor king in your nation (I proceeded),
and that the nations who believed in the suffering Christ would look for
His future appearance. And for this reason the Holy Spirit had uttered
these truths in a parable, and obscurely: for,” I added, “it is said,
‘Judah, thy brethren have praised thee: thy hands \[shall be\] on the
neck of thine enemies; the sons of thy father shall worship thee. Judah
is a lion’s whelp; from the germ, my son, thou art sprung up. Reclining,
he lay down like a lion, and like \[a lion’s\] whelp: who shall raise
him up? A ruler shall not depart from Judah, or a leader from his
thighs, until that which is laid up in store for him shall come; and he
shall be the desire of nations, binding his foal to the vine, and the
foal of his ass to the tendril of the vine. He shall wash his garments
in wine, and his vesture in the blood of the grape. His eyes shall be
bright with <span id="fr_2112"></span>[2113](#fn_2112.md) wine, and his
teeth white like milk.’ <span id="fr_2113"></span>[2114](#fn_2113.md)
Moreover, that in your nation there never failed either prophet or
ruler, from the time when they began until the time when this Jesus
Christ appeared and suffered, you will not venture shamelessly to
assert, nor can you prove it. For though you affirm that Herod,
after <span id="fr_2114"></span>[2115](#fn_2114.md) whose \[reign\] He
suffered, was an Ashkelonite, nevertheless you admit that there was a
high priest in your nation; so that you then had one who presented
offerings according to the law of Moses, and observed the other legal
ceremonies; also \[you had\] prophets in succession until John, (even
then, too, when your nation was carried captive to Babylon, when your
land was ravaged by war, and the sacred vessels carried off); there
never failed to be a prophet among you, who was lord, and leader, and
ruler of your nation. For the Spirit which was in the prophets anointed
your kings, and established them. But after the manifestation and death
of our Jesus Christ in your nation, there was and is nowhere any
prophet: nay, further, you ceased to exist under your own king, your
land was laid waste, and forsaken like a lodge in a vineyard; and the
statement of Scripture, in the mouth of Jacob, ‘And He shall be the
desire of nations,’ meant symbolically His two advents, and that the
nations would believe in Him; which facts you may now at length discern.
For those out of all the nations who are pious and righteous through the
faith of Christ, look for His future appearance.
