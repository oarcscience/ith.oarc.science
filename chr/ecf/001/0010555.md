### <span id="viii.iv.xciv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XCIV.—In what sense he who hangs on a tree is cursed.

<span id="viii.iv.xciv-p1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.xciv-p1.1"></span><span id="viii.iv.xciv-p1.2"></span>“For
tell me, was it not God who commanded by Moses that no image or likeness
of anything which was in heaven above or which was on the earth should
be made, and yet who caused the brazen serpent to be made by Moses in
the wilderness, and set it up for a sign by which those bitten by
serpents were saved? Yet is He free from unrighteousness. For by this,
as I previously remarked, He proclaimed the mystery, by which He
declared that He would break the power of the serpent which occasioned
the transgression of Adam, and \[would bring\] to them that believe on
Him \[who was foreshadowed\] by this sign, i.e., Him who was to be
crucified, salvation from the fangs of the serpent, which are wicked
deeds, idolatries, and other unrighteous acts. Unless the matter be so
understood, give me a reason why Moses set up the brazen serpent for a
sign, and bade those that were bitten gaze at it, and the wounded were
healed; and this, too, when he had himself commanded that no likeness of
anything whatsoever should be made.”

<span id="viii.iv.xciv-p2"></span>On this, another of those who came on
the second day said, “You have spoken truly: we cannot give a reason.
For I have frequently interrogated the teachers about this matter, and
none of them gave me a reason: therefore continue what you are speaking;
for we are paying attention while you unfold the mystery, on account of
which the doctrines of the prophets are falsely slandered.”

<span id="viii.iv.xciv-p3"></span> <span id="page_247">p. 247</span>
<span id="viii.iv.xciv-Page_247"></span> Then I replied, “Just as God
commanded the sign to be made by the brazen serpent, and yet He is
blameless; even so, though a curse lies in the law against persons who
are crucified, yet no curse lies on the Christ of God, by whom all that
have committed things worthy of a curse are saved. <span
