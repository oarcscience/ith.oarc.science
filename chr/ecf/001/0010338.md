<span id="vi.ii.ii"></span>

### <span id="vi.ii.ii-p0.1"></span>Chapter II.—The Jewish sacrifices are now abolished.

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p1"></span><span id="vi.ii.ii-p1.1"></span><span
id="vi.ii.ii-p1.2"></span>Since, therefore, the days are evil, and
Satan <span id="fr_1455"></span>[1456](#fn_1455.md) possesses the power of
this world, we ought to give heed to ourselves, and diligently inquire
into the ordinances of the Lord. Fear and patience, then, are helpers of
our faith; and long-suffering and continence are things which fight on
our side. While these remain pure in what respects the Lord, Wisdom,
Understanding, Science, and Knowledge rejoice along with them. <span
id="fr_1456"></span>[1457](#fn_1456.md) For He hath revealed to us by all
the prophets that He needs neither sacrifices, nor burnt-offerings, nor
oblations, saying thus, “What is the multitude of your sacrifices unto
Me, saith the Lord? I am full of burnt-offerings, and desire not the fat
of lambs, and the blood of bulls and goats, not when ye come to appear
before <span id="page_138">p. 138</span> <span
id="vi.ii.ii-Page_138"></span> Me: for who hath required these things at
your hands? Tread no more My courts, not though ye bring with you fine
flour. Incense is a vain abomination unto Me, and your new moons and
sabbaths I cannot endure.” <span id="fr_1457"></span>[1458](#fn_1457.md)
<span id="vi.ii.ii-p4.2"></span>He has therefore abolished these things,
that the new law of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is without the yoke of
necessity, might have a human oblation. <span
id="fr_1458"></span>[1459](#fn_1458.md) And again He says to them, “Did I
command your fathers, when they went out from the land of Egypt, to
offer unto Me burnt-offerings and sacrifices? But this rather I
commanded them, Let no one of you cherish any evil in his heart against
his neighbour, and love not an oath of falsehood.” <span
id="fr_1459"></span>[1460](#fn_1459.md) We ought therefore, being possessed
of understanding, to perceive the gracious intention of our Father; for
He speaks to us, desirous that we, not <span
id="fr_1460"></span>[1461](#fn_1460.md) going astray like them, should ask
how we may approach Him. To us, then, He declares, “A sacrifice
\[pleasing\] to God is a broken spirit; a smell of sweet savour to the
Lord is a heart that glorifieth Him that made it.” <span
id="fr_1461"></span>[1462](#fn_1461.md) We ought therefore, brethren,
carefully to inquire concerning our salvation, lest the wicked one,
having made his entrance by deceit, should hurl <span
id="fr_1462"></span>[1463](#fn_1462.md) us forth from our \[true\] life.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1455"></span>[137:1456](0010338.htm#fr_1455.md) <span
id="vi.ii.ii-p1.3"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p2"></span> The Latin text is literally, “the
adversary;” the Greek has, “and he that worketh possesseth power;”
Hilgenfeld reads, “he that worketh against,” the idea expressed above
being intended.

<span id="fn_1456"></span>[137:1457](0010338.htm#fr_1456.md) <span
id="vi.ii.ii-p2.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p3"></span> Or, “while these things continue, those
which respect the Lord rejoice in purity along with them—Wisdom,” etc.

<span id="fn_1457"></span>[138:1458](0010338.htm#fr_1457.md) <span
id="vi.ii.ii-p3.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p4"></span> [Isa. i.
11-14](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#011.md)<span id="vi.ii.ii-p4.1"></span>,
from the Sept., as is the case throughout. We have given the quotation
as it stands in Cod. Sin.

<span id="fn_1458"></span>[138:1459](0010338.htm#fr_1458.md) <span
id="vi.ii.ii-p4.3"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p5"></span> Thus in the Latin. The Greek reads,
“might not have a man-made oblation.” The Latin text seems preferable,
implying that, instead of the outward sacrifices of the law, there is
now required a dedication of *man himself*. Hilgenfeld follows the
Greek.

<span id="fn_1459"></span>[138:1460](0010338.htm#fr_1459.md) <span
id="vi.ii.ii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p6"></span> [Jer. vii.
22](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#022.md)<span id="vi.ii.ii-p6.1"></span>;
[Zech. viii. 17](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#017.md)<span
id="vi.ii.ii-p6.2"></span>.

<span id="fn_1460"></span>[138:1461](0010338.htm#fr_1460.md) <span
id="vi.ii.ii-p6.3"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p7"></span> So the Greek. Hilgenfeld, with the Latin,
omits “not.”

<span id="fn_1461"></span>[138:1462](0010338.htm#fr_1461.md) <span
id="vi.ii.ii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p8"></span> [Ps. li.
19](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#019.md)<span id="vi.ii.ii-p8.1"></span>.
There is nothing in Scripture corresponding to the last clause.

<span id="fn_1462"></span>[138:1463](0010338.htm#fr_1462.md) <span
id="vi.ii.ii-p8.2"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p9"></span> Literally, “sling us out.”
