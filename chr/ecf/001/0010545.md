### <span id="viii.iv.lxxxiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter LXXXIV.—That prophecy, “Behold, a virgin,” etc., suits Christ alone.

virgin shall conceive, and bear a son,’ was uttered respecting Him. For
if He to whom Isaiah referred was not to be begotten of a virgin, of
whom <span id="fr_2278"></span>[2279](#fn_2278) did the Holy Spirit
declare, ‘Behold, the Lord Himself shall give us a sign: behold, the
virgin shall conceive, and bear a son?’ For if He also were to be
begotten of sexual intercourse, like all other first-born sons, why did
God say that He would give a sign which is not common to all the
first-born sons? But that which is truly a sign, and which was to be
made trustworthy to mankind,—namely, that the first-begotten of all
creation should become incarnate by the Virgin’s womb, and be a
child,—this he anticipated by the Spirit of prophecy, and predicted it,
as I have repeated to you, in various ways; in order that, when the
event should take place, it might be known as the operation of the power
and will of the Maker of all things; just as Eve was made from one of
Adam’s ribs, and as all living beings were created in the beginning by
the word of God. But you in these matters venture to pervert the
expositions which your elders that were with Ptolemy king of Egypt gave
forth, since you assert that the Scripture is not so as they have
expounded it, but says, ‘Behold, the young woman shall conceive,’ as if
great events were to be inferred if a woman should beget from sexual
intercourse: which indeed all young women, with the exception of the
barren, do; but even these, God, if He wills, is able to cause \[to
bear\]. For Samuel’s mother, who was barren, brought forth by the will
of God; and so also the wife of the holy patriarch Abraham; and
Elisabeth, who bore John the Baptist, and other such. So that you must
not suppose that it is impossible for God to do anything He wills. And
especially when it was predicted that this would take place, do not
venture to pervert or misinterpret the prophecies, since you will injure
yourselves alone, and will not harm God.
