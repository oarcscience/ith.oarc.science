## <span id="ix.i-p0.1"></span>Introductory Note to Irenæus Against Heresies

<span id="ix.i-p1"></span>\[<span class="upper"><span
id="ix.i-p1.1"></span>a.d.</span> 120–202.\] <span class="upper"><span
id="ix.i-p1.2"></span>This</span> history introduces us to the Church in
her Western outposts. We reach the banks of the Rhone, where for nearly
a century Christian missions have flourished. Between Marseilles and
Smyrna there seems to have been a brisk trade, and Polycarp had sent
Pothinus into Celtic Gaul at an early date as its evangelist. He had
fixed his see at Lyons, when Irenæus joined him as a presbyter, having
been his fellow-pupil under Polycarp. There, under the “good Aurelius,”
as he is miscalled (<span class="upper"><span
id="ix.i-p1.3"></span>a.d.</span> 177), arose the terrible persecution
which made “the martyrs of Lyons and Vienne” so memorable. It was during
this persecution that Irenæus was sent to Rome with letters of
remonstrance against the rising pestilence of heresy; and he was
probably the author of the account of the sufferings of the martyrs
which is appended to their testimony. <span
id="fr_2648"></span>[2649](#fn_2648.md) But he had the mortification of
finding the Montanist heresy patronized by Eleutherus the Bishop of
Rome; and there he met an old friend from the school of Polycarp, who
had embraced the Valentinian heresy. We cannot doubt that to this visit
we owe the lifelong struggle of Irenæus against the heresies that now
came in, like locusts, to devour the harvests of the Gospel. But let it
be noted here, that, so far from being “the mother and mistress” of even
the Western Churches, Rome herself is a mission of the Greeks; <span
id="fr_2649"></span>[2650](#fn_2649.md) Southern Gaul is evangelized from
Asia Minor, and Lyons checks the heretical tendencies of the Bishop at
Rome. Ante-Nicene Christianity, and indeed the Church herself, appears
in Greek costume which lasts through the synodical period; and Latin
Christianity, when it begins to appear, is African, and not Roman. It is
strange that those who have recorded this great historical fact have so
little perceived its bearings upon Roman pretensions in the Middle Ages
and modern times.

<span id="ix.i-p4"></span>Returning to Lyons, our author found that the
venerable Pothinus had closed his holy career by a martyr’s death; and
naturally Irenæus became his successor. When the emissaries of heresy
followed him, and began to disseminate their licentious practices and
foolish doctrines by the aid of “silly women,” the great work of his
life began. He condescended to study these diseases of the human mind
like a wise physician; and, sickening as was the process of classifying
and describing them, he made this also his laborious task, that he might
enable others to withstand and to overcome them. The works he has left
us are monuments of his fidelity to Christ, and to the charges of St.
Paul, St. Peter, and St. Jude, whose solemn warnings now proved to be
prophecies. No marvel that the great apostle, “night and day with
tears,” had forewarned the churches of “the grievous wolves” which were
to make havoc of the fold.

<span id="ix.i-p5"></span>If it shocks the young student of the virgin
years of Christianity to find such a state of things, let him reflect
that it was all foretold by Christ himself, and demonstrates the malice
and power of the adversary. “An enemy hath done this,” said the Master.
The spirit that was then working <span id="page_310">p. 310</span> <span
id="ix.i-Page_310"></span> “in the children of disobedience,” now
manifested itself. The awful visions of the Apocalypse began to be
realized. It was now evident in what sense “the Prince of peace” had
pronounced His mission, “not peace, but a sword.” In short, it became a
conspicuous fact, that the Church here on earth is “militant;” while, at
the same time, there was seen to be a profound philosophy in the
apostolic comment, <span id="fr_2650"></span>[2651](#fn_2650.md) “There
must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be
made manifest.” In the divine economy of Providence it was permitted
that every form of heresy which was ever to infest the Church should now
exhibit its essential principle, and attract the censures of the
faithful. Thus testimony to primitive truth was secured and recorded:
the language of catholic orthodoxy was developed and defined, and
landmarks of faith were set up for perpetual memorial to all
generations. It is a striking example of this divine economy, that the
see of Rome was allowed to exhibit its fallibility very conspicuously at
this time, and not only to receive the rebukes of Irenæus, but to accept
them as wholesome and necessary; so that the heresy of Eleutherus, and
the spirit of Diotrephes in Victor, have enabled reformers ever since,
and even in the darkest days of pontifical despotism, to testify against
the manifold errors patronized by Rome. Hilary and other Gallicans have
been strengthened by the example of Irenæus, and by his faithful words
of reproof and exhortation, to resist Rome, even down to our own times.

<span id="ix.i-p7"></span>That the intolerable absurdities of Gnosticism
should have gained so many disciples, and proved itself an adversary to
be grappled with and not despised, throws light on the condition of the
human mind under heathenism, even when it professed “knowledge” and
“philosophy.” The task of Irenæus was twofold: (1) to render it
impossible for any one to confound Gnosticism with Christianity, and (2)
to make it impossible for such a monstrous system to survive, or ever to
rise again. His task was a nauseous one; but never was the spirit
enjoined by Scripture more patiently exhibited, nor with more entire
success. <span id="fr_2651"></span>[2652](#fn_2651.md) If Julian had found
Gnosticism just made to his hand, and powerful enough to suit his
purposes, the whole history of his attempt to revive Paganism would have
been widely different. Irenæus demonstrated its essential unity with the
old mythology, and with heathen systems of philosophy. If the fog and
malaria that rose with the Day-star, and obscured it, were speedily
dispersed, our author is largely to be identified with the radiance
which flowed from the Sun of righteousness, and with the breath of the
Spirit that banished them for ever.

<span id="ix.i-p9"></span>The Episcopate of Irenæus was distinguished by
labours, “in season and out of season,” for the evangelization of
Southern Gaul; and he seems to have sent missionaries into other regions
of what we now call France. In spite of Paganism and heresy, he rendered
Lyons a Christian city; and Marcus seems to have retreated before his
terrible castigation, taking himself off to regions beyond the
Pyrenees. <span id="fr_2652"></span>[2653](#fn_2652.md) But the pacific
name he bears, was rendered yet more illustrious by his interposition to
compose the Easter Controversy, then threatening to impair, if not to
destroy, the unity of the Church. The beautiful *concordat* between East
and West, in which Polycarp and Anicetus had left the question, was now
disturbed by Victor, Bishop of Rome, whose turbulent spirit would not
accept the compromise of his predecessor. Irenæus remonstrates with him
in a catholic spirit, and overrules his impetuous temper. At the Council
of Nice, the rule for the observance of Easter was finally settled by
the whole Church; and the forbearing example of Irenæus, no doubt
contributed greatly to this happy result. The blessed peacemaker
survived this great triumph, for a short time only, closing his life,
like a true shepherd, with thousands of his flock, in the massacre
(<span class="upper"><span id="ix.i-p10.1"></span>a.d.</span> 202)
stimulated by the wolfish Emperor Severus.

<span id="ix.i-p11"></span>The <span class="upper"><span
id="ix.i-p11.1"></span>Introductory Notice</span> of the learned
translators <span id="fr_2653"></span>[2654](#fn_2653.md) is as follows:—

<span id="ix.i-p13"></span> <span id="page_311">p. 311</span> <span
id="ix.i-Page_311"></span> <span class="upper"><span
id="ix.i-p13.1"></span>The</span> work of Irenæus *Against Heresies* is
one of the most precious remains of early Christian antiquity. It is
devoted, on the one hand, to an account and refutation of those
multiform Gnostic heresies which prevailed in the latter half of the
second century; and, on the other hand, to an exposition and defence of
the Catholic faith.

<span id="ix.i-p14"></span>In the prosecution of this plan, the author
divides his work into five books. The first of these contains a minute
description of the tenets of the various heretical sects, with
occasional brief remarks in illustration of their absurdity, and in
confirmation of the truth to which they were opposed. In his second
book, Irenæus proceeds to a more complete demolition of those heresies
which he has already explained, and argues at great length against them,
on grounds principally of reason. The three remaining books set forth
more directly the true doctrines of revelation, as being in utter
antagonism to the views held by the Gnostic teachers. In the course of
this argument, many passages of Scripture are quoted and commented on;
many interesting statements are made, bearing on the rule of faith; and
much important light is shed on the doctrines, held, as well as the
practices observed, by the Church of the second century.

<span id="ix.i-p15"></span>It may be made matter of regret, that so
large a portion of the work of Irenæus is given to an exposition of the
manifold Gnostic speculations. Nothing more absurd than these has
probably ever been imagined by rational beings. Some ingenious and
learned men have indeed endeavoured to reconcile the wild theories of
these heretics with the principles of reason; but, as Bishop Kaye
remarks (*Eccl. Hist. of the Second and Third Centuries*, p. 524), “a
more arduous or unpromising undertaking cannot well be conceived.” The
fundamental object of the Gnostic speculations was doubtless to solve
the two grand problems of all religious philosophy, viz., How to account
for the existence of evil; and, How to reconcile the finite with the
infinite. But these ancient theorists were not more successful in
grappling with such questions than have been their successors in modern
times. And by giving loose reins to their imagination, they built up the
most incongruous and ridiculous systems; while, by deserting the
guidance of Scripture they were betrayed into the most pernicious and
extravagant errors.

<span id="ix.i-p16"></span>Accordingly, the patience of the reader is
sorely tried, in following our author through those mazes of absurdity
which he treads, in explaining and refuting these Gnostic speculations.
This is especially felt in the perusal of the first two books, which, as
has been said, are principally devoted to an exposition and subversion
of the various heretical systems. But the vagaries of the human mind,
however melancholy in themselves, are never altogether destitute of
instruction. And in dealing with those set before us in this work, we
have not only the satisfaction of becoming acquainted with the currents
of thought prevalent in these early times, but we obtain much valuable
information regarding the primitive Church, which, had it not been for
these heretical schemes, might never have reached our day.

<span id="ix.i-p17"></span>Not a little of what is contained in the
following pages will seem almost unintelligible to the English reader.
And it is scarcely more comprehensible to those who have pondered long
on the original. We have inserted brief notes of explanation where these
seemed specially necessary. But we have not thought it worth while to
devote a great deal of space to the elucidation of those obscure Gnostic
views which, in so many varying forms, are set forth in this work. For
the same reason, we give here no account of the origin, history, and
successive phases of Gnosticism. Those who wish to know the views of the
learned on these points, may consult the writings of Neander, Baur, and
others, among the Germans, or the lectures of Dr. Burton in English;
while a succinct description of the whole matter will be found in the
“Preliminary Observations on the Gnostic System,” prefixed to Harvey’s
edition of Irenæus.

<span id="ix.i-p18"></span>The great work of Irenæus, now for the first
time translated into English, is unfortunately no longer extant in the
original. It has come down to us only in an ancient Latin version, with
the exception of the greater part of the first book, which has been
preserved in the original Greek, through means of copious quotations
made by Hippolytus and Epiphanius. The text, both Latin <span
id="page_312">p. 312</span> <span id="ix.i-Page_312"></span> and Greek,
is often most uncertain. Only three <span class="upper"><span
id="ix.i-p18.1"></span>mss.</span> of the work *Against Heresies* are at
present known to exist. Others, however, were used in the earliest
printed editions put forth by Erasmus. And as these codices were more
ancient than any now available, it is greatly to be regretted that they
have disappeared or perished. One of our difficulties throughout, has
been to fix the readings we should adopt, especially in the first book.
Varieties of reading, actual or conjectural, have been noted only when
some point of special importance seemed to be involved.

<span id="ix.i-p19"></span>After the text has been settled, according to
the best judgment which can be formed, the work of translation remains;
and that is, in this case, a matter of no small difficulty. Irenæus,
even in the original Greek, is often a very obscure writer. At times he
expresses himself with remarkable clearness and terseness; but, upon the
whole, his style is very involved and prolix. And the Latin version adds
to these difficulties of the original, by being itself of the most
barbarous character. In fact, it is often necessary to make a
conjectural re-translation of it into Greek, in order to obtain some
inkling of what the author wrote. Dodwell supposes this Latin version to
have been made about the end of the fourth century; but as Tertullian
seems to have used it, we must rather place it in the beginning of the
third. Its author is unknown, but he was certainly little qualified for
his task. We have endeavoured to give as close and accurate a
translation of the work as possible, but there are not a few passages in
which a guess can only be made as to the probable meaning.

<span id="ix.i-p20"></span>Irenæus had manifestly taken great pains to
make himself acquainted with the various heretical systems which he
describes. His mode of exposing and refuting these is generally very
effective. It is plain that he possessed a good share of learning, and
that he had a firm grasp of the doctrines of Scripture. Not unfrequently
he indulges in a kind of sarcastic humour, while inveighing against the
folly and impiety of the heretics. But at times he gives expression to
very strange opinions. He is, for example, quite peculiar in imagining
that our Lord lived to be an *old* man, and that His public ministry
embraced at least *ten* years. But though, on these and some other
points, the judgment of Irenæus is clearly at fault, his work contains a
vast deal of sound and valuable exposition of Scripture, in opposition
to the fanciful systems of interpretation which prevailed in his day.

<span id="ix.i-p21"></span>We possess only very scanty accounts of the
personal history of Irenæus. It has been generally supposed that he was
a native of Smyrna, or some neighbouring city, in Asia Minor. Harvey,
however, thinks that he was probably born in Syria, and removed in
boyhood to Smyrna. He himself tells us (iii. 3, 4) that he was in early
youth acquainted with Polycarp, the illustrious bishop of that city. A
sort of clue is thus furnished as to the date of his birth. Dodwell
supposes that he was born so early as <span class="upper"><span
id="ix.i-p21.1"></span>a.d.</span> 97, but this is clearly a mistake;
and the general date assigned to his birth is somewhere between <span
class="upper"><span id="ix.i-p21.2"></span>a.d.</span> 120 and <span
class="upper"><span id="ix.i-p21.3"></span>a.d.</span> 140.

<span id="ix.i-p22"></span>It is certain that Irenæus was bishop of
Lyons, in France, during the latter quarter of the second century. The
exact period or circumstances of his ordination cannot be determined.
Eusebius states (*Hist. Eccl.*, v. 4) that he was, while yet a
presbyter, sent with a letter, from certain members of the Church of
Lyons awaiting martyrdom, to Eleutherus, bishop of Rome; and that (v. 5)
he succeeded Pothinus as bishop of Lyons, probably about <span
class="upper"><span id="ix.i-p22.1"></span>a.d.</span> 177. His great
work *Against Heresies* was, we learn, written during the episcopate of
Eleutherus, that is, between <span class="upper"><span
id="ix.i-p22.2"></span>a.d.</span> 182 and <span class="upper"><span
id="ix.i-p22.3"></span>a.d.</span> 188, for Victor succeeded to the
bishopric of Rome in <span class="upper"><span
id="ix.i-p22.4"></span>a.d.</span> 189. This new bishop of Rome took
very harsh measures for enforcing uniformity throughout the Church as to
the observance of the paschal solemnities. On account of the severity
thus evinced, Irenæus addressed to him a letter (only a fragment of
which remains), warning him that if he persisted in the course on which
he had entered, the effect would be to rend the Catholic Church in
pieces. This letter had the desired result; and the question was more
temperately debated, until finally settled by the Council of Nice.

<span id="ix.i-p23"></span>The full title of the principal work of
Irenæus, as given by Eusebius (*Hist. Eccl.*, v. 7), and <span
id="page_313">p. 313</span> <span id="ix.i-Page_313"></span> indicated
frequently by the author himself, was *A Refutation and Subversion of
Knowledge falsely so called*, but it is generally referred to under the
shorter title, *Against Heresies*. Several other smaller treatises are
ascribed to Irenæus; viz., *An Epistle to Florinus*, of which a small
fragment has been preserved by Eusebius; a treatise *On the Valentinian
Ogdoad*; a work called forth by the paschal controversy, entitled *On
Schism*, and another *On Science*; all of which that remain will be
found in our next volume of his writings. Irenæus is supposed to have
died about <span class="upper"><span id="ix.i-p23.1"></span>a.d.</span>
202; but there is probably no real ground for the statement of Jerome,
repeated by subsequent writers, that he suffered martyrdom, since
neither Tertullian nor Eusebius, nor other early authorities, make any
mention of such a fact.

<span id="ix.i-p24"></span>As has been already stated, the first printed
copy of our author was given to the world by Erasmus. This was in the
year 1526. Between that date and 1571, a number of reprints were
produced in both folio and octavo. All these contained merely the
ancient barbarous Latin version, and were deficient towards the end by
five entire chapters. These latter were supplied by the edition of
Feuardent, Professor of Divinity at Paris, which was published in 1575,
and went through six subsequent editions. Previously to this, however,
another had been set forth by Gallasius, a minister of Geneva, which
contained the first portions of the Greek text from Epiphanius. Then, in
1702, came the edition of Grabe, a learned Prussian, who had settled in
England. It was published at Oxford, and contained considerable
additions to the Greek text, with fragments. Ten years after this there
appeared the important Paris edition by the Benedictine monk Massuet.
This was reprinted at Venice in the year 1724, in two thin folio
volumes, and again at Paris in a large octavo, by the Abbé Migne, in
1857. A German edition was published by Stieren in 1853. In the year
1857 there was also brought out a Cambridge edition, by the Rev. Wigan
Harvey, in two octavo volumes. The two principal features of this
edition are: the additions which have been made to the Greek text from
the recently discovered *Philosophoumena* of Hippolytus; and the further
addition of thirty-two fragments of a Syriac version of the Greek text
of Irenæus, culled from the Nitrian collection of Syriac <span
class="upper"><span id="ix.i-p24.1"></span>mss.</span> in the British
Museum. These fragments are of considerable interest, and in some
instances rectify the readings of the barbarous Latin version, where,
without such aid, it would have been unintelligible. The edition of
Harvey will be found constantly referred to in the notes appended to our
translation.

have been far easier to give a loose and flowing translation of the
obscure and involved sentences of Irenæus; but the object has been
studiously kept in view, to place the English reader, as much as
possible, in the position of one who has immediate access to the Greek
