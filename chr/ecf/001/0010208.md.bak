### <span id="v.vii.ix-p0.1"></span>Chapter IX.—Honour the bishop.

<span id="v.vii.ix-p1"></span><span id="v.vii.ix-p1.1"></span><span
id="v.vii.ix-p1.2"></span><span
id="v.vii.ix-p1.3"></span>Moreover, <span
id="fr_1031"></span>[1032](#fn_1031.md) it is in accordance with reason
that we should return to soberness \[of conduct\], and, while yet we
have opportunity, exercise repentance towards God. <span
id="v.vii.ix-p2.1"></span>It is well to reverence <span
id="fr_1032"></span>[1033](#fn_1032.md) both God and the bishop. He who
honours the bishop has been honoured by God; he who does anything
without the knowledge of the bishop, does \[in reality\] serve the
devil. Let all things, then, abound to you through grace, for ye are
worthy. Ye have refreshed me in all things, and Jesus Christ \[shall
refresh\] you. Ye have loved me when absent as well as when present. May
God recompense you, for whose sake, while ye endure all things, ye shall
attain unto Him.

<span id="v.vii.ix-p4"></span><span id="v.vii.ix-p4.1"></span><span
id="v.vii.ix-p4.2"></span><span id="v.vii.ix-p4.3"></span>Moreover, it
is in accordance with reason that we should return to soberness \[of
conduct\], and, while yet we have opportunity, exercise repentance
towards God. For “in Hades there is no one who can confess his
sins.” <span id="fr_1033"></span>[1034](#fn_1033.md) For “behold the man,
and his work is before him.” <span id="fr_1034"></span>[1035](#fn_1034.md)
And \[the Scripture saith\], “My son, honour thou God and the
king.” <span id="fr_1035"></span>[1036](#fn_1035.md) <span
id="v.vii.ix-p7.2"></span>And say I, Honour thou God indeed, as the
Author and Lord of all things, but the bishop as the high-priest, who
bears the image of God—of God, inasmuch as he is a ruler, and of Christ,
in his capacity of a priest. After Him, we must also honour the king.
For there is no one superior to God, or even like to Him, among all the
beings that exist. Nor is there any one in the Church greater than the
bishop, who ministers as a priest to God for the salvation of the whole
world. Nor, again, is there any one among rulers to be compared with the
king, who secures peace and good order to those over whom he rules. He
who honours the bishop shall be honoured by God, even as he that
dishonours him shall be punished by God. For if he that rises up against
kings is justly held worthy of punishment, inasmuch as he dissolves
public order, of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be
thought worthy, <span id="fr_1036"></span>[1037](#fn_1036.md) who presumes
to do anything without the bishop, thus both destroying the \[Church’s\]
unity, and throwing its order into confusion? For the priesthood is the
very highest point of all good things among men, against which whosoever
is mad enough to strive, dishonours not man, but God, and Christ Jesus,
the First-born, and the only High Priest, by nature, of the Father. Let
all things therefore be done by you with good order in Christ. <span
id="v.vii.ix-p8.2"></span><span id="v.vii.ix-p8.3"></span>Let the laity
be subject to the deacons; the deacons to the presbyters; the presbyters
to the bishop; the bishop to Christ, even as He is to the Father. As ye,
brethren, have refreshed me, so will Jesus Christ refresh you. Ye have
loved me when absent, as well as when present. God will recompense you,
for whose sake ye have shown such kindness towards His prisoner. For
even if I am not worthy of it, yet your zeal \[to help me\] is an
admirable <span id="fr_1037"></span>[1038](#fn_1037.md) thing. For “he who
honours a prophet in the name of a prophet, shall receive a prophet’s
reward.” <span id="fr_1038"></span>[1039](#fn_1038.md) It is manifest also,
that he who honours a prisoner of Jesus Christ shall receive the reward
of the martyrs.
