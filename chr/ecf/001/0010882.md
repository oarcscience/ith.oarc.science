<span id="ix.viii.vii-p1"></span><span
id="ix.viii.vii-p1.1"></span>This <span
id="fr_4810"></span>[4811](#fn_4810) \[custom\], of not bending the knee
upon Sunday, is a symbol of the resurrection, through which we have been
set free, by the grace of Christ, from sins, and from death, which has
been put to death under Him. Now this custom took its rise from
apostolic times, as the blessed Irenæus, the martyr and bishop of Lyons,
declares in his treatise *On Easter*, in which he makes mention of
Pentecost also; upon which \[feast\] we do not bend the knee, because it
is <span id="page_570">p. 570</span> <span
id="ix.viii.vii-Page_570"></span> of equal significance with the Lord’s
day, for the reason already alleged concerning it.

<span id="ix.viii.vii-p2"></span> Taken from a work (*Quæs. et Resp. ad
Othod.*) ascribed to Justin Martyr, but certainly written after the
Nicene Council. It is evident that this is not an exact quotation from
Irenæus, but a summary of his words. The “Sunday” here referred to must
be Easter Sunday. Massuet’s emendation of the text has been adopted,
<span class="Greek"><span id="ix.viii.vii-p2.1"></span>ἐπ’ αὐτοῦ</span>
for <span class="Greek"><span id="ix.viii.vii-p2.2"></span>ἐπ’
αὐτῶν</span>.
