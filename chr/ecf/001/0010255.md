### <span id="v.xiv.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.—The true doctrine respecting Christ.

<span id="v.xiv.iii-p1"></span>Mindful of him, do ye by all means know
that Jesus the Lord was truly born of Mary, being made of a woman; and
was as truly crucified. For, says he, “God forbid that I should glory,
save in the cross of the Lord Jesus.” <span
id="fr_1186"></span>[1187](#fn_1186) And He really suffered, and died,
and rose again. For says \[Paul\], “If Christ should become passible,
and should be the first to rise again from the dead.” <span
id="fr_1187"></span>[1188](#fn_1187) And again, “In that He died, He
died unto sin once: but in that He liveth, He liveth unto God.” <span
id="fr_1188"></span>[1189](#fn_1188) Otherwise, what advantage would
there be in \[becoming subject to\] bonds, if Christ has not died? what
advantage in patience? what advantage in \[enduring\] stripes? And why
such facts as the following: Peter was crucified; Paul and James were
slain with the sword; John was banished to Patmos; Stephen was stoned to
death by the Jews who killed the Lord? But, \[in truth,\] none of these
sufferings were in vain; for the Lord was really crucified by the
ungodly.
