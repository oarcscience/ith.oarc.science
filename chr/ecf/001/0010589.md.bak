### <span id="viii.iv.cxxviii-p0.1"></span>Chapter CXXVIII.—The Word is sent not as an inanimate power, but as a person begotten of the Father’s substance.

<span id="viii.iv.cxxviii-p1"></span>“And that Christ being Lord, and
God the Son of God, and appearing formerly in power as Man, and Angel,
and in the glory of fire as at the bush, so also was manifested at the
judgment executed on Sodom, has been demonstrated fully by what has been
said.” <span id="viii.iv.cxxviii-p1.1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.cxxviii-p1.2"></span>Then I repeated once more all that I
had previously quoted from Exodus, about the vision in the bush, and the
naming of Joshua (Jesus), and continued: <span
id="viii.iv.cxxviii-p1.3"></span>“And do not suppose, sirs, that I am
speaking superfluously when I repeat these words frequently: but it is
because I know that some wish to anticipate these remarks, and to say
that the power sent from the Father of all which appeared to Moses, or
to Abraham, or to Jacob, is called an Angel because He came to men (for
by Him the commands of the Father have been proclaimed to men); is
called Glory, because He appears in a vision sometimes that cannot be
borne; is called a Man, and a human being, because He appears arrayed in
such forms as the Father pleases; <span
id="viii.iv.cxxviii-p1.4"></span>and they call Him the Word, because He
carries tidings from the Father to men: but maintain that this power is
indivisible and inseparable from the Father, just as they say that the
light of the sun on earth is indivisible and inseparable from the sun in
the heavens; as when it sinks, the light sinks along with it; so the
Father, when He chooses, say they, causes His power to spring forth, and
when He chooses, He makes it return to Himself. In this way, they teach,
He made the angels. But it is proved that there are angels who always
exist, and are never reduced to that form out of which they sprang. And
that this power which the prophetic word calls God, as has been also
amply demonstrated, and Angel, is not numbered \[as different\] in name
only like the light of the sun but is indeed something numerically
distinct, I have discussed briefly in what has gone before; when I
asserted that this power was begotten from the Father, by His power and
will, but not by abscission, as if the essence of the Father were
divided; as all other things partitioned and divided are not the same
after as before they were divided: and, for the sake of example, I took
the case of fires kindled from a fire, which we see to be distinct from
it, and yet that from which many can be kindled is by no means made
less, but remains the same.
