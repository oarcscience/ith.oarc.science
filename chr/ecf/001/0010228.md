### <span id="v.x.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.

<span id="v.x.v-p1"></span>Flee wicked arts; but all the more discourse
regarding them. <span id="v.x.v-p1.1"></span>Speak to my sisters, that
they love in our Lord, and that their husbands be sufficient for them in
the flesh and spirit. Then, again, charge my brethren in the name of our
Lord Jesus Christ, that they love their wives, as our Lord His Church.
If any man is able in power to continue in purity, <span
id="fr_1139"></span>[1140](#fn_1139) to the honour of the flesh of our
Lord, let him continue so without boasting; if he boasts, he is undone;
if he become known apart from the bishop, he has destroyed
himself. <span id="fr_1140"></span>[1141](#fn_1140) It is becoming,
therefore, to men and women who marry, that they marry with the counsel
of the bishop, that the marriage may be in our Lord, and not in lust.
Let everything, therefore, be \[done\] for the honour of God.
