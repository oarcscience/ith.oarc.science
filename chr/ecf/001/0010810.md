### <span id="ix.vi.xvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XV.—At first God deemed it sufficient to inscribe the natural law, or the Decalogue, upon the hearts of men; but afterwards He found it necessary to bridle, with the yoke of the Mosaic law, the desires of the Jews, who were abusing their liberty; and even to add some special commands, because of the hardness of their hearts.

<span id="ix.vi.xvi-p1"></span>1. <span id="ix.vi.xvi-p1.1"></span><span
id="ix.vi.xvi-p1.2"></span>They (the Jews) had therefore a law, a course
of discipline, and a prophecy of future things. For God at the first,
indeed, warning them by means of natural precepts, which from the
beginning He had implanted in mankind, that is, by means of the
Decalogue (which, if any one does not observe, he has no salvation), did
then demand nothing more of them. As Moses says in Deuteronomy, “These
are all the words which the Lord spake to the whole assembly of the sons
of Israel on the mount, and He added no more; and He wrote them on two
tables of stone, and gave them to me.” <span
id="fr_3968"></span>[3969](#fn_3968) For this reason \[He did so\], that
they who are willing to follow Him might keep these commandments. But
when they turned themselves to make a calf, and had gone back in their
minds to Egypt, desiring to be slaves instead of free-men, they were
placed for the future in a state of servitude suited to their wish,—\[a
slavery\] which did not indeed cut them off from God, but subjected them
to the yoke of bondage; as Ezekiel the prophet, when stating the reasons
for the giving of such a law, declares: “And their eyes were after the
desire of their heart; and I gave them statutes that were not good, and
judgments in which they shall not live.” <span
id="fr_3969"></span>[3970](#fn_3969) <span id="page_480">p. 480</span>
<span id="ix.vi.xvi-Page_480"></span> Luke also has recorded that
Stephen, who was the first elected into the diaconate by the
apostles, <span id="fr_3970"></span>[3971](#fn_3970) and who was the
first slain for the testimony of Christ, spoke regarding Moses as
follows: “This man did indeed receive the commandments of the living God
to give to us, whom your fathers would not obey, but thrust \[Him from
them\], and in their hearts turned back again into Egypt, saying unto
Aaron, Make us gods to go before us; for we do not know what has
happened to \[this\] Moses, who led us from the land of Egypt. And they
made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifices to the idol, and were
rejoicing in the works of their own hands. But God turned, and gave them
up to worship the hosts of heaven; as it is written in the book of the
prophets: <span id="fr_3971"></span>[3972](#fn_3971) O ye house of
Israel, have ye offered to Me sacrifices and oblations for forty years
in the wilderness? And ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star
of the god Remphan, <span id="fr_3972"></span>[3973](#fn_3972) figures
which ye made to worship them;” <span
id="fr_3973"></span>[3974](#fn_3973) pointing out plainly, that the law
being such, was not given to them by another God, but that, adapted to
their condition of servitude, \[it originated\] from the very same \[God
as we worship\]. Wherefore also He says to Moses in Exodus: “I will send
forth My angel before thee; for I will not go up with thee, because thou
art a stiff-necked people.” <span id="fr_3974"></span>[3975](#fn_3974)

<span id="ix.vi.xvi-p9"></span>2. And not only so, but the Lord also
showed that certain precepts were enacted for them by Moses, on account
of their hardness \[of heart\], and because of their unwillingness to be
obedient, when, on their saying to Him, “Why then did Moses command to
give a writing of divorcement, and to send away a wife?” He said to
them, “Because of the hardness of your hearts he permitted these things
to you; but from the beginning it was not so;” <span
id="fr_3975"></span>[3976](#fn_3975) thus exculpating Moses as a
faithful servant, but acknowledging one God, who from the beginning made
male and female, and reproving them as hard-hearted and disobedient. And
therefore it was that they received from Moses this law of divorcement,
adapted to their hard nature. But why say I these things concerning the
Old Testament? For in the New also are the apostles found doing this
very thing, on the ground which has been mentioned, Paul plainly
declaring, “But these things I say, not the Lord.” <span
id="fr_3976"></span>[3977](#fn_3976) And again: “But this I speak by
permission, not by commandment.” <span
id="fr_3977"></span>[3978](#fn_3977) And again: “Now, as concerning
virgins, I have no commandment from the Lord; yet I give my judgment, as
one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful.” <span
id="fr_3978"></span>[3979](#fn_3978) But further, in another place he
says: “That Satan tempt you not for your incontinence.” <span
id="fr_3979"></span>[3980](#fn_3979) If, therefore, even in the New
Testament, the apostles are found granting certain precepts in
consideration of human infirmity, because of the incontinence of some,
lest such persons, having grown obdurate, and despairing altogether of
their salvation, should become apostates from God,—it ought not to be
wondered at, if also in the Old Testament the same God permitted similar
indulgences for the benefit of His people, drawing them on by means of
the ordinances already mentioned, so that they might obtain the gift of
salvation through them, while they obeyed the Decalogue, and being
restrained by Him, should not revert to idolatry, nor apostatize from
God, but learn to love Him with the whole heart. And if certain persons,
because of the disobedient and ruined Israelites, do assert that the
giver (*doctor*) of the law was limited in power, they will find in our
dispensation, that “many are called, but few chosen;” <span
id="fr_3980"></span>[3981](#fn_3980) and that there are those who
inwardly are wolves, yet wear sheep’s clothing in the eyes of the world
(*foris*); and that God has always preserved freedom, and the power of
self-government in man, <span id="fr_3981"></span>[3982](#fn_3981) while
at the same time He issued His own exhortations, in order that those who
do not obey Him should be righteously judged (condemned) because they
have not obeyed Him; and that those who have obeyed and believed on Him
should be honoured with immortality.
