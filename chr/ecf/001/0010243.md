### <span id="v.xii.i-p0.1"></span>Chapter I.

<span id="v.xii.i-p1"></span><span class="upper"><span
id="v.xii.i-p1.1"></span>From</span> of old have I prayed to God, that I
might be counted worthy to behold your faces which are worthy of God:
now, therefore, being bound in Jesus Christ, I hope to meet you and
salute you, if it be the will \[of God\] that I should be accounted
worthy to the end. For the beginning is well arranged, if I be counted
worthy to attain to the end, that I may receive my portion, without
hindrance, through suffering. For I am in fear of your love, lest it
should injure me. As to you, indeed, it is easy for you to do whatsoever
ye wish; but as to me, it is difficult for me to be accounted worthy of
God, if indeed ye spare me not.
