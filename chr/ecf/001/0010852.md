### <span id="ix.vii.xv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIV.—Unless the flesh were to be saved, the Word would not have taken upon Him flesh of the same substance as ours: from this it would follow that neither should we have been reconciled by Him.

<span id="ix.vii.xv-p1"></span>1. <span id="ix.vii.xv-p1.1"></span><span
id="ix.vii.xv-p1.2"></span>And inasmuch as the apostle has not
pronounced against the very substance of flesh and blood, that it cannot
inherit the kingdom of God, the same apostle has everywhere adopted the
term “flesh and blood” with regard to the Lord Jesus Christ, partly
indeed to establish His human nature (for He did Himself speak of
Himself as the Son of man), and partly that He might confirm the
salvation of our flesh. For if the flesh were not in a position to be
saved, the Word of God would in no wise have become flesh. And if the
blood of the righteous were not to be inquired after, the Lord would
certainly not have had blood \[in His composition\]. But inasmuch as
blood cries out (*vocalis est*) from the beginning \[of the world\], God
said to Cain, when he had slain his brother, “The voice of thy brother’s
blood crieth to Me.” <span id="fr_4562"></span>[4563](#fn_4562.md) And as
their blood will be inquired after, He said to those with Noah, “For
your blood of your souls will I require, \[even\] from the hand of all
beasts;” <span id="fr_4563"></span>[4564](#fn_4563.md) and again,
“Whosoever will shed man’s blood, <span
id="fr_4564"></span>[4565](#fn_4564.md) it shall be shed for his blood.” In
like manner, too, did the Lord say to those who should afterwards shed
His blood, “All righteous blood shall be required which is shed upon the
earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zacharias the
son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple and the altar. Verily
I say unto you, All these things shall come upon this generation.” <span
id="fr_4565"></span>[4566](#fn_4565.md) He thus points out the
recapitulation that should take place in his own person of the effusion
of blood from the beginning, of all the righteous men and of the
prophets, and that by means of Himself there should be a requisition of
their blood. Now this \[blood\] could not be required unless it also had
the capability of being saved; nor would the Lord have summed up these
things in Himself, unless He had Himself been made flesh and blood after
the way of the original formation \[of man\], saving in his own person
at the end that which had in the beginning perished in Adam.

<span id="ix.vii.xv-p6"></span>2. But if the Lord became incarnate for
any other order of things, and took flesh of any other substance, He has
not then summed up human nature in His own person, nor in that case can
He be termed flesh. For flesh has been truly made \[to consist in\] a
transmission of that thing moulded originally from the dust. But if it
had been necessary for Him to draw the material \[of His body\] from
another substance, the Father would at the beginning have moulded the
material \[of flesh\] from a different substance \[than from what He
actually did\]. But now the case stands thus, that the Word has saved
that which really was \[created, viz.,\] humanity which had perished,
effecting by means of Himself that communion which should be held with
it, and seeking out its salvation. But the thing which had perished
possessed flesh and blood. For the Lord, taking dust from the earth,
moulded man; and it was upon his behalf that all the dispensation of the
Lord’s advent took place. He had Himself, therefore, flesh and blood,
recapitulating in Himself not a certain other, but that original
handiwork of the Father, seeking out that thing which had perished. And
for this cause the apostle, in the Epistle to the Colossians, says, “And
though ye were formerly alienated, and enemies to His knowledge by evil
works, yet now ye have been reconciled in the body of His flesh, through
His death, to present yourselves holy and chaste, and without fault in
His sight.” <span id="fr_4566"></span>[4567](#fn_4566.md) He says, “Ye have
been reconciled in the body of His flesh,” because the righteous flesh
has reconciled that flesh which was being kept under bondage in sin, and
brought it into friendship with God.

<span id="ix.vii.xv-p8"></span>3. If, then, any one allege that in this
respect the flesh of the Lord was different from ours, because it indeed
did not commit sin, neither <span id="page_542">p. 542</span> <span
id="ix.vii.xv-Page_542"></span> was deceit found in His soul, while we,
on the other hand, are sinners, he says what is the fact. But if he
pretends that the, Lord possessed another substance of flesh, the
sayings respecting reconciliation will not agree with that man. For that
thing is reconciled which had formerly been in enmity. Now, if the Lord
had taken flesh from another substance, He would not, by so doing, have
reconciled that one to God which had become inimical through
transgression. But now, by means of communion with Himself, the Lord has
reconciled man to God the Father, in reconciling us to Himself by the
body of His own flesh, and redeeming us by His own blood, as the apostle
says to the Ephesians, “In whom we have redemption through His blood,
the remission of sins;” <span id="fr_4567"></span>[4568](#fn_4567.md) and
again to the same he says, “Ye who formerly were far off have been
brought near in the blood of Christ;” <span
id="fr_4568"></span>[4569](#fn_4568.md) and again, “Abolishing in His flesh
the enmities, \[even\] the law of commandments \[contained\] in
ordinances.” <span id="fr_4569"></span>[4570](#fn_4569.md) And in every
Epistle the apostle plainly testifies, that through the flesh of our
Lord, and through His blood, we have been saved.

<span id="ix.vii.xv-p12"></span>4. If, therefore, flesh and blood are
the things which procure for us life, it has not been declared of flesh
and blood, in the literal meaning (*proprie*) of the terms, that they
cannot inherit the kingdom of God; but \[these words apply\] to those
carnal deeds already mentioned, which, perverting man to sin, deprive
him of life. And for this reason he says, in the Epistle to the Romans:
“Let not sin, therefore, reign in your mortal body, to be under its
control: neither yield ye your members instruments of unrighteousness
unto sin; but yield yourselves to God, as being alive from the dead, and
your members as instruments of righteousness unto God.” <span
id="fr_4570"></span>[4571](#fn_4570.md) In these same members, therefore,
in which we used to serve sin, and bring forth fruit unto death, does He
wish us to \[be obedient\] unto righteousness, that we may bring forth
fruit unto life. Remember, therefore, my beloved friend, that thou hast
been redeemed by the flesh of our Lord, re-established <span
id="fr_4571"></span>[4572](#fn_4571.md) by His blood; and “holding the
Head, from which the whole body of the Church, having been fitted
together, takes increase” <span id="fr_4572"></span>[4573](#fn_4572.md)
—that is, acknowledging the advent in the flesh of the Son of God, and
\[His\] divinity (*deum*), and looking forward with constancy to His
human nature <span id="fr_4573"></span>[4574](#fn_4573) (*hominem*.md),
availing thyself also of these proofs drawn from Scripture—thou dost
easily overthrow, as I have pointed out, all those notions of the
heretics which were concocted afterwards.

patient waiting for “Christ’s second advent to judge the world.” The
phrase might also be translated, and “receiving stedfastly His human
nature.”
