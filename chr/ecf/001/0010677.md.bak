<span id="viii.ix.x-p1"></span><span id="viii.ix.x-p1.1"></span><span
id="viii.ix.x-p1.2"></span><span id="viii.ix.x-p1.3"></span>By the two
birds <span id="fr_2636"></span>[2637](#fn_2636.md) Christ is denoted, both
dead as man, and living as God. He is likened to a bird, because He is
understood and declared to be from above, and from heaven. And the
living bird, having been dipped in the blood of the dead one, was
afterwards let go. For the living and divine Word was in the crucified
and dead temple \[of the body\], as being a partaker of the passion, and
yet impassible to God.

<span id="viii.ix.x-p3"></span>By that which took place in the
running <span id="fr_2637"></span>[2638](#fn_2637.md) water, in which the
wood and the hyssop and the scarlet were dipped, is set forth the bloody
passion of Christ on the cross for the salvation of those who are
sprinkled with the Spirit, and the water, and the blood. Wherefore the
material for purification was not provided chiefly with reference to
leprosy, but with regard to the forgiveness of sins, that both leprosy
might be understood to be an emblem of sin, and the things which were
sacrificed an emblem of Him who was to be sacrificed for sins.

<span id="viii.ix.x-p5"></span>For this reason, consequently, he ordered
that the scarlet should be dipped at the same time in the water, thus
predicting that the flesh should no longer possess its natural \[evil\]
properties. For this reason, also, were there the two birds, the one
being sacrificed in the water, and the other dipped both in the blood
and in the water and then sent away, just as is narrated also respecting
the goats.

<span id="viii.ix.x-p6"></span><span id="viii.ix.x-p6.1"></span>The goat
that was sent away presented a type of Him who taketh away the sins of
men. But the two contained a representation of the one economy of God
incarnate. For He was wounded for our transgressions, and He bare the
sins of many, and He was delivered for our iniquities.—*From manuscript
of writings of* <span class="upper"><span
id="viii.ix.x-p6.2"></span>Justin</span>.
