<span id="viii.iv.lxiv"></span>

### <span id="viii.iv.lxiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter LXIV.—Justin adduces other proofs to the Jew, who denies that he needs this Christ.

<span id="viii.iv.lxiv-p1"></span>Here Trypho said, “Let Him be
recognised as Lord and Christ and God, as the Scriptures declare, by you
of the Gentiles, who have from His name been all called Christians; but
we who are servants of God that made this same \[Christ\], do not
require to confess or worship Him.”

<span id="viii.iv.lxiv-p2"></span>To this I replied, “If I were to be
quarrelsome and light-minded like you, Trypho, I would no longer
continue to converse with you, since you are prepared not to understand
what has been said, but only to return some captious answer; <span
id="fr_2187"></span>[2188](#fn_2187.md) but now, since I fear the judgment
of God, I do not state an untimely opinion concerning any one of your
nation, as to whether or not some of them may be saved by the grace of
the Lord of Sabaoth. Therefore, although you act wrongfully, I shall
continue to reply to any proposition you shall bring forward, and to any
contradiction which you make; and, in fact, I do the very same to all
men of every nation, who wish to examine along with me, or make inquiry
at me, regarding this subject. Accordingly, if you had bestowed
attention on the Scriptures previously quoted by me, you would already
have understood, that those who are saved of your own nation are saved
through this <span id="fr_2188"></span>[2189](#fn_2188.md) \[man\], and
partake of His lot; and you would not certainly have asked me about this
matter. <span id="viii.iv.lxiv-p4.1"></span>I shall again repeat the
words of David previously quoted by me, and beg of you to comprehend
them, and not to act wrongfully, and stir each other up to give merely
some contradiction. The words which David speaks, then, are these: ‘The
Lord has reigned; let the nations be angry: \[it is\] He who sits upon
the cherubim; let the earth be shaken. The Lord is great in Zion; and He
is high above all the nations. Let them confess Thy great name, for it
is fearful and holy; and the honour of the king loves judgment. Thou
hast prepared equity; judgment and righteousness hast Thou performed in
Jacob. Exalt the Lord our God, and worship the footstool of His feet;
for He is holy. Moses and Aaron among His priests, and Samuel among them
that call upon His name; they called on the Lord, and He heard them. In
the pillar of the cloud He spake to them; for they kept His testimonies
and His commandments which He gave them.’ <span
id="fr_2189"></span>[2190](#fn_2189.md) And <span id="page_230">p.
230</span> <span id="viii.iv.lxiv-Page_230"></span> from the other words
of David, also previously quoted, which you foolishly affirm refer to
Solomon, \[because\] inscribed for Solomon, it can be proved that they
do not refer to Solomon, and that this \[Christ\] existed before the
sun, and that those of your nation who are saved shall be saved through
Him. \[The words\] are these: ‘O God, give Thy judgment to the king, and
Thy righteousness unto the king’s son. He shall judge <span
id="fr_2190"></span>[2191](#fn_2190.md) Thy people with righteousness, and
Thy poor with judgment. The mountains shall take up peace to the people,
and the little hills righteousness. He shall judge the poor of the
people, and shall save the children of the needy, and shall abase the
slanderer: and He shall co-endure with the sun, and before the moon unto
all generations;’ and so on until, ‘His name endureth before the sun,
and all tribes of the earth shall be blessed in Him. All nations shall
call Him blessed. Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, who only doeth
wondrous things: and blessed be His glorious name for ever and ever: and
the whole earth shall be filled with His glory. Amen, Amen.’ <span
id="fr_2191"></span>[2192](#fn_2191.md) And you remember from other words
also spoken by David, and which I have mentioned before, how it is
declared that He would come forth from the highest heavens, and again
return to the same places, in order that you may recognise Him as God
coming forth from above, and man living among men; and \[how it is
declared\] that He will again appear, and they who pierced Him shall see
Him, and shall bewail Him. \[The words\] are these: ‘The heavens declare
the glory of God, and the firmament showeth His handiwork. Day unto day
uttereth speech, and night unto night showeth knowledge: They are not
speeches or words whose voices are heard. Their sound has gone out
through all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world. In the
sun has he set his habitation; and he, like a bridegroom going forth
from his chamber, will rejoice as a giant to run his race: from the
highest heaven is his going forth, and he returns to the highest heaven,
and there is not one who shall be hidden from his heat.’ ” <span
