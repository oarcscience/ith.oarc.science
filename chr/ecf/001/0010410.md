### <span id="viii.ii.xxxvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXVII.—Utterances of the Father.

<span id="viii.ii.xxxvii-p1"></span>And that this too may be clear to
you, there were spoken from the person of the Father through Isaiah the
prophet, the following words: “The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his
master’s crib; but Israel doth not know, and My people hath not
understood. Woe, sinful nation, a people full of sins, a wicked seed,
children that are transgressors, ye have forsaken the Lord.” <span
id="fr_1840"></span>[1841](#fn_1840.md) And again elsewhere, when the same
prophet speaks in like manner from the person of the Father, “What is
the house that ye will build for Me? saith the Lord. The heaven is My
throne, and the earth is My footstool.” <span
id="fr_1841"></span>[1842](#fn_1841.md) And again, in another place, “Your
new moons and your sabbaths My soul hateth; and the great day of the
fast and of ceasing from labour I cannot away with; nor, if ye come to
be seen of Me, will I hear you: your hands are full of blood; and if ye
bring fine flour, incense, it is abomination unto Me: the fat of lambs
and the blood of bulls I do not desire. For who hath required this at
your hands? But loose every bond of wickedness, tear asunder the tight
knots of violent contracts, cover the houseless and naked, deal thy
bread to the hungry.” <span id="fr_1842"></span>[1843](#fn_1842.md) What
kind of things are taught through the prophets from \[the person of\]
God, you can now perceive.
