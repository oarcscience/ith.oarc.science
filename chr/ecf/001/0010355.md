### <span id="vi.ii.xix-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIX.—The way of light.

<span id="vi.ii.xix-p1"></span><span id="vi.ii.xix-p1.1"></span><span
id="vi.ii.xix-p1.2"></span><span id="vi.ii.xix-p1.3"></span><span
id="vi.ii.xix-p1.4"></span>The way of light, then, is as follows. If any
one desires to travel to the appointed place, he must be zealous in his
works. The knowledge, therefore, which is given to us for the purpose of
walking in this way, is the following. Thou shalt love Him that created
thee: <span id="fr_1686"></span>[1687](#fn_1686) thou shalt glorify Him
that redeemed thee from death. Thou shalt be simple in heart, and rich
in spirit. Thou shalt not join thyself to those who walk in the way of
death. Thou shalt hate doing what is unpleasing to God: thou shalt hate
all hypocrisy. Thou shalt not forsake the commandments of the Lord. Thou
shalt not exalt thyself, but shalt be of a lowly mind. <span
id="fr_1687"></span>[1688](#fn_1687) Thou shalt not take glory to
thyself. Thou shalt not take evil counsel against thy neighbour. Thou
shalt not allow over-boldness to enter into thy soul. <span
id="fr_1688"></span>[1689](#fn_1688) <span
id="vi.ii.xix-p4.1"></span>Thou shalt not commit fornication: thou shalt
not commit adultery: thou shalt not be a corrupter of youth. Thou shalt
not let the word of God issue from thy lips with any kind of
impurity. <span id="fr_1689"></span>[1690](#fn_1689) Thou shalt not
accept persons when thou reprovest any one for transgression. Thou shalt
be meek: thou shalt be peaceable. Thou shalt tremble at the words which
thou hearest. <span id="fr_1690"></span>[1691](#fn_1690) Thou shalt not
be mindful of evil against thy brother. Thou shalt not be of doubtful
mind <span id="fr_1691"></span>[1692](#fn_1691) as to whether a thing
shall be or not. Thou shalt not take the name <span
id="fr_1692"></span>[1693](#fn_1692) of the Lord in vain. Thou shalt
love thy neighbour more than thine own soul. <span
id="fr_1693"></span>[1694](#fn_1693) Thou shalt not slay the child by
procuring abortion; nor, again, shalt thou destroy it after it is born.
<span id="vi.ii.xix-p9.1"></span>Thou shalt not withdraw thy hand from
thy son, or from thy daughter, but from their infancy thou shalt teach
them the fear of the Lord. <span id="fr_1694"></span>[1695](#fn_1694)
Thou shalt not covet what is thy neighbour’s, nor shalt thou be
avaricious. Thou shalt not be joined in soul with the haughty, but thou
shalt be reckoned with the righteous and lowly. Receive thou as good
things the trials <span id="fr_1695"></span>[1696](#fn_1695) which come
upon thee. <span id="fr_1696"></span>[1697](#fn_1696) Thou shalt not be
of double mind or of double tongue, <span
id="fr_1697"></span>[1698](#fn_1697) for a double tongue is a snare of
death. Thou shalt be subject <span id="fr_1698"></span>[1699](#fn_1698)
to the Lord, and to \[other\] masters as the image of God, with modesty
and fear. Thou shalt not issue orders with bitterness to thy maidservant
or thy man-servant, who trust in the same \[God <span
id="fr_1699"></span>[1700](#fn_1699) \], lest thou shouldst not <span
id="fr_1700"></span>[1701](#fn_1700) reverence that God who is above
both; for He came to call men not according to their outward
appearance, <span id="fr_1701"></span>[1702](#fn_1701) but according as
the Spirit had prepared them. <span id="fr_1702"></span>[1703](#fn_1702)
Thou shalt communicate in all things with thy neighbour; thou shalt not
call <span id="fr_1703"></span>[1704](#fn_1703) things thine own; for if
ye are partakers in common of things which are incorruptible, <span
id="fr_1704"></span>[1705](#fn_1704) how much more \[should you be\] of
those things which are corruptible! <span
id="fr_1705"></span>[1706](#fn_1705) Thou shalt not be hasty with thy
tongue, for the mouth is a snare of death. As far as possible, thou
shalt be pure in thy soul. Do not be ready to stretch forth thy hands to
take, whilst thou contractest them to give. Thou shalt love, as the
apple of thine eye, every one that speaketh to thee the word of the
Lord. Thou shalt remember the day of judgment, night and day. Thou shalt
seek out every day the faces of the saints, <span
id="fr_1706"></span>[1707](#fn_1706) either by word examining them, and
going to exhort them, and meditating how to save a soul by the
word, <span id="fr_1707"></span>[1708](#fn_1707) or by thy hands thou
shalt labour for the redemption of thy sins. <span
id="vi.ii.xix-p23.1"></span>Thou shalt not hesitate to give, nor murmur
when thou givest. “Give to every one that asketh thee,” <span
id="fr_1708"></span>[1709](#fn_1708) and thou shalt know who is the good
Recompenser of the reward. Thou shalt preserve what thou hast received
\[in charge\], neither adding to it nor taking from it. To the last thou
shalt hate the wicked <span id="fr_1709"></span>[1710](#fn_1709)
\[one\]. <span id="fr_1710"></span>[1711](#fn_1710) Thou shalt judge
righteously. Thou shalt not make a schism, but thou shalt pacify those
that contend by bringing them together. <span
id="vi.ii.xix-p26.1"></span><span id="vi.ii.xix-p26.2"></span>Thou shalt
<span id="page_149">p. 149</span> <span id="vi.ii.xix-Page_149"></span>
confess thy sins. <span id="vi.ii.xix-p26.3"></span>Thou shalt not go to
prayer with an evil conscience. This is the way of light. <span
id="fr_1711"></span>[1712](#fn_1711)

<span id="vi.ii.xix-p23"></span> The text is here confused in all the
editions; we have followed that of Dressel. Cod. Sin. is defective.
Hilgenfeld’s text reads, “Thou shalt seek out every day the faces of the
saints, either labouring by word and going to exhort them, and
meditating to save a soul by the word, or by thy hands thou shalt labour
for the redemption of thy sins”—almost identical with that given above.
