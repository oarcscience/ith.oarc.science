### <span id="ix.vi.ii-p0.1"></span>Chapter I.—The Lord acknowledged but one God and Father.

<span id="ix.vi.ii-p1"></span>1. <span id="ix.vi.ii-p1.1"></span><span
id="ix.vi.ii-p1.2"></span><span class="upper"><span
id="ix.vi.ii-p1.3"></span>Since</span>, therefore, this is sure and
stedfast, that no other God or Lord was announced by the Spirit, except
Him who, as God, rules over all, together with His Word, and those who
receive the Spirit of adoption, <span
id="fr_3804"></span>[3805](#fn_3804.md) that is, those who believe in the
one and true God, and in Jesus Christ the Son of God; and likewise that
the apostles did of themselves term no one else as God, or name \[no
other\] as Lord; and, what is much more important, \[since it is true\]
that our Lord \[acted likewise\], who did also command us to confess no
one as Father, except Him who is in the heavens, who is the one God and
the one Father;—those things are clearly shown to be false which these
deceivers and most perverse sophists advance, maintaining that the being
whom they have themselves invented is by nature both God and Father; but
that the Demiurge is naturally neither God nor Father, but is so termed
merely by courtesy (*verbo tenus*), because of his ruling the creation,
these perverse mythologists state, setting their thoughts against God;
and, putting aside the doctrine of Christ, and of themselves divining
falsehoods, they dispute against the entire dispensation of God. For
they maintain that their Æons, and gods, and fathers, and lords, are
also still further termed heavens, together with their Mother, whom they
do also call “the Earth,” and “Jerusalem,” while they also style her
many other names.

<span id="ix.vi.ii-p3"></span>2. Now to whom is it not clear, that if
the Lord had known many fathers and gods, He would not have taught His
disciples to know \[only\] one God, <span
id="fr_3805"></span>[3806](#fn_3805.md) and to call Him alone Father? But
He did the rather distinguish those who by word merely (*verbo tenus*)
are termed gods, from Him who is truly God, that they should not err as
to His doctrine, nor understand one \[in mistake\] for another. And if
He did indeed teach us to call one Being Father and God, while He does
from time to time Himself confess other fathers and gods in the same
sense, then He will appear to enjoin a different course upon His
disciples from what He follows Himself. Such conduct, however, does not
bespeak the good teacher, but a misleading and invidious one. The
apostles, too, according to these men’s showing, are proved to be
transgressors of the commandment, since they confess the Creator as God,
and Lord, and Father, as I have shown—if He is not alone God and Father.
Jesus, therefore, will be to them the author and teacher of such
transgression, inasmuch as He commanded that one Being should be called
Father, <span id="fr_3806"></span>[3807](#fn_3806.md) thus imposing upon
them the necessity of confessing the Creator as their Father, as has
been pointed out.
