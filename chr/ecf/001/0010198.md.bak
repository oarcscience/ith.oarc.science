### <span id="v.vi.xi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XI.—Thanks and salutation.

<span id="v.vi.xi-p1"></span><span id="v.vi.xi-p1.1"></span>Now, as to
Philo the deacon, of Cilicia, a man of reputation, who still ministers
to me in the word of God, along with Rheus Agathopus, an elect man, who
has followed me from Syria, not regarding <span
id="fr_966"></span>[967](#fn_966.md) his life,—these bear witness in your
behalf; and I myself give thanks to God for you, that ye have received
them, even as the Lord you. But may those that dishonoured them be
forgiven through the grace of Jesus Christ! <span
id="v.vi.xi-p2.1"></span>The love of the brethren at Troas salutes you;
whence also I write to you by Burrhus, who was sent along with me by the
Ephesians and Smyrnæans, to show their respect. <span
id="fr_967"></span>[968](#fn_967.md) <span id="v.vi.xi-p3.1"></span>May the
Lord Jesus Christ honour them, in whom they hope, in flesh, and soul,
and faith, and love, and concord! <span id="v.vi.xi-p3.2"></span>Fare ye
well in Christ Jesus, our common hope.

<span id="v.vi.xi-p4"></span><span id="v.vi.xi-p4.1"></span>Now, as to
Philo the deacon, a man of Cilicia, of high reputation, who still
ministers to me in the word of God, along with Gaius and Agathopus, an
elect man, who has followed me from Syria, not regarding <span
id="fr_968"></span>[969](#fn_968.md) his life,—these also bear testimony in
your behalf. And I myself give thanks to God for you, because ye have
received them: and the Lord will also receive you. But may those that
dishonoured them be forgiven through the grace of Jesus Christ, “who
wisheth not the death of the sinner, but his repentance.” <span
id="fr_969"></span>[970](#fn_969.md) <span id="v.vi.xi-p6.4"></span><span
id="v.vi.xi-p6.5"></span>The love of the brethren at Troas salutes you;
whence also I write to you by Burrhus, <span
id="fr_970"></span>[971](#fn_970.md) who was sent along with me by the
Ephesians and Smyrnæans, to show their respect: <span
id="fr_971"></span>[972](#fn_971.md) whom the Lord Jesus Christ will
requite, in whom they hope, in flesh, and soul, and spirit, and faith,
and love, and concord. <span id="v.vi.xi-p8.1"></span><span
id="v.vi.xi-p8.2"></span>Fare ye well in the Lord Jesus Christ, our
common hope, in the Holy Ghost.
