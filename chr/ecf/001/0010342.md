### <span id="vi.ii.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.—The sufferings of Christ, and the new covenant, were announced by the prophets.

<span id="vi.ii.vi-p1"></span><span id="vi.ii.vi-p1.1"></span><span
id="vi.ii.vi-p1.2"></span>When, therefore, He has fulfilled the
commandment, what saith He? “Who is he that will contend with Me? let
him oppose Me: or who is he that will enter into judgment with Me? let
him draw near to the servant of the Lord.” <span
id="fr_1492"></span>[1493](#fn_1492.md) “Woe unto you, for ye shall all wax
old, like a garment, and the moth shall eat you up.” <span
id="fr_1493"></span>[1494](#fn_1493.md) And again the prophet says,
“Since <span id="fr_1494"></span>[1495](#fn_1494.md) as a mighty stone He
is laid for crushing, behold I cast down for the foundations of Zion a
stone, precious, elect, a corner-stone, honourable.” Next, what says He?
“And he who shall trust <span id="fr_1495"></span>[1496](#fn_1495.md) in it
shall live for ever.” Is our hope, then, upon a stone? Far from it. But
\[the language is used\] inasmuch as He laid his flesh \[as a
foundation\] with power; for He says, “And He placed me as a firm
rock.” <span id="fr_1496"></span>[1497](#fn_1496.md) And the prophet says
again, “The stone which the builders rejected, the same has become the
head of the corner.” <span id="fr_1497"></span>[1498](#fn_1497.md) And
again he says, “This is the great and wonderful day which the Lord hath
made.” <span id="fr_1498"></span>[1499](#fn_1498.md) I write the more
simply unto you, that ye may understand. I am the off-scouring of your
love. <span id="fr_1499"></span>[1500](#fn_1499.md) What, then, again says
the prophet? “The assembly of the wicked surrounded me; they encompassed
me as bees do a honeycomb,” <span id="fr_1500"></span>[1501](#fn_1500.md)
and “upon my garment they cast lots.” <span
id="fr_1501"></span>[1502](#fn_1501.md) Since, therefore, He was about to
be manifested and to suffer in the flesh, His suffering was foreshown.
For the prophet speaks against Israel, “Woe to their soul, because they
have counselled an evil counsel against themselves, <span
id="fr_1502"></span>[1503](#fn_1502.md) saying, Let us bind the just one,
because he is displeasing to us.” <span
id="fr_1503"></span>[1504](#fn_1503.md) And Moses also says to them, <span
id="fr_1504"></span>[1505](#fn_1504.md) “Behold these things, saith the
Lord God: Enter into the good land which the Lord swore \[to give\] to
Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and inherit ye it, a land flowing with
milk and honey.” <span id="fr_1505"></span>[1506](#fn_1505.md) What, then,
says Knowledge? <span id="fr_1506"></span>[1507](#fn_1506.md) Learn:
“Trust,” she says, “in Him who is to be manifested to you in the
flesh—that is, Jesus.” For man is earth in a suffering state, for the
formation of Adam was from the face of the earth. What, then, meaneth
this: “into the good land, a land flowing with milk and honey?” Blessed
be our Lord, who has placed in us wisdom and understanding of secret
things. For the prophet says, “Who shall understand the parable of the
Lord, except him who is wise and prudent, and who loves his Lord?” <span
id="fr_1507"></span>[1508](#fn_1507.md) <span
id="vi.ii.vi-p17.3"></span>Since, therefore, having renewed us by the
remission of our sins, He hath made us after another pattern, \[it is
His purpose\] that we should possess the soul of children, inasmuch as
He has created us anew by His Spirit. <span
id="fr_1508"></span>[1509](#fn_1508.md) For the Scripture says concerning
us, while He speaks to the Son, “Let Us make man after Our image, and
after Our likeness; and let them have dominion over the beasts of the
earth, and the fowls of heaven, and the fishes of the sea.” <span
id="fr_1509"></span>[1510](#fn_1509.md) And the Lord said, on beholding the
fair creature <span id="fr_1510"></span>[1511](#fn_1510.md) man, “Increase,
and multiply, and replenish the earth.” <span
id="fr_1511"></span>[1512](#fn_1511.md) These things \[were spoken\] to the
Son. Again, I will show thee how, in respect to us, <span
id="fr_1512"></span>[1513](#fn_1512.md) He has accomplished a second
fashioning in these last days. The Lord says, “Behold, I will make <span
id="fr_1513"></span>[1514](#fn_1513.md) the last like the first.” <span
id="fr_1514"></span>[1515](#fn_1514.md) In reference to this, then, the
prophet proclaimed, “Enter ye into the land <span id="page_141">p.
141</span> <span id="vi.ii.vi-Page_141"></span> flowing with milk and
honey, and have dominion over it.” <span
id="fr_1515"></span>[1516](#fn_1515.md) Behold, therefore, we have been
refashioned, as again He says in another prophet, “Behold, saith the
Lord, I will take away from these, that is, from those whom the Spirit
of the Lord foresaw, their stony hearts, and I will put hearts of flesh
within them,” <span id="fr_1516"></span>[1517](#fn_1516.md) because
He <span id="fr_1517"></span>[1518](#fn_1517.md) was to be manifested in
flesh, and to sojourn among us. For, my brethren, the habitation of our
heart is a holy temple to the Lord. <span
id="fr_1518"></span>[1519](#fn_1518.md) For again saith the Lord, “And
wherewith shall I appear before the Lord my God, and be
glorified?” <span id="fr_1519"></span>[1520](#fn_1519.md) He says, <span
id="fr_1520"></span>[1521](#fn_1520.md) “I will confess to thee in the
Church in the midst <span id="fr_1521"></span>[1522](#fn_1521.md) of my
brethren; and I will praise thee in the midst of the assembly of the
saints.” <span id="fr_1522"></span>[1523](#fn_1522.md) We, then, are they
whom He has led into the good land. What, then, mean milk and honey?
This, that as the infant is kept alive first by honey, and then by milk,
so also we, being quickened and kept alive by the faith of the promise
and by the word, shall live ruling over the earth. But He said
above, <span id="fr_1523"></span>[1524](#fn_1523.md) “Let them increase,
and rule over the fishes.” <span id="fr_1524"></span>[1525](#fn_1524.md)
Who then is able to govern the beasts, or the fishes, or the fowls of
heaven? For we ought to perceive that to govern implies authority, so
that one should command and rule. If, therefore, this does not exist at
present, yet still He has promised it to us. When? When we ourselves
also have been made perfect \[so as\] to become heirs of the covenant of
the Lord. <span id="fr_1525"></span>[1526](#fn_1525.md)
