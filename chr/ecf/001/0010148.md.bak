### <span id="v.iii.ii-p0.1"></span>Chapter II.—I rejoice in your messengers.

<span id="v.iii.ii-p1"></span><span id="v.iii.ii-p1.1"></span><span
id="v.iii.ii-p1.2"></span><span id="v.iii.ii-p1.3"></span>Since, then, I
have had the privilege of seeing you, through Damas your most worthy
bishop, and through your worthy presbyters Bassus and Apollonius, and
through my fellow-servant the deacon Sotio, whose friendship may I ever
enjoy, inasmuch as he is subject to the bishop as to the grace of God,
and to the presbytery as to the law of Jesus Christ, \[I now write <span
id="fr_637"></span>[638](#fn_637.md) to you\].

<span id="v.iii.ii-p3"></span><span id="v.iii.ii-p3.1"></span><span
id="v.iii.ii-p3.2"></span><span id="v.iii.ii-p3.3"></span>Since, then, I
have had the privilege of seeing you, through Damas your most
worthy <span id="fr_638"></span>[639](#fn_638.md) bishop, and through your
worthy <span id="fr_639"></span>[640](#fn_639.md) presbyters Bassus and
Apollonius, and through my fellow-servant the deacon Sotio, whose
friendship may I ever enjoy, <span id="fr_640"></span>[641](#fn_640.md)
inasmuch as he, by the grace of God, is subject to the bishop and
presbytery, in the law of Jesus Christ, \[I now write <span
id="fr_641"></span>[642](#fn_641.md) to you\].
