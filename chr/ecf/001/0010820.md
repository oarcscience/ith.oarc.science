### <span id="ix.vi.xxvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXV.—Both covenants were prefigured in Abraham, and in the labour of Tamar; there was, however, but one and the same God to each covenant.

<span id="ix.vi.xxvi-p1"></span>1. <span id="ix.vi.xxvi-p1.1"></span>For
thus it had behoved the sons of Abraham \[to be\], whom God has raised
up to him from the stones, <span id="fr_4140"></span>[4141](#fn_4140)
and caused to take a place beside him who was made the chief and the
forerunner of our faith (who did also receive the covenant of
circumcision, after that justification by faith which had pertained to
him, when he was yet in uncircumcision, so that in him both covenants
might be prefigured, that he might be <span id="page_496">p. 496</span>
<span id="ix.vi.xxvi-Page_496"></span> the father of all who follow the
Word of God, and who sustain a life of pilgrimage in this world, that
is, of those who from among the circumcision and of those from among the
uncircumcision are faithful, even as also “Christ <span
id="fr_4141"></span>[4142](#fn_4141) is the chief corner-stone”
sustaining all things); and He gathered into the one faith of Abraham
those who, from either covenant, are eligible for God’s building. But
this faith which is in uncircumcision, as connecting the end with the
beginning, has been made \[both\] the first and the last. For, as I have
shown, it existed in Abraham antecedently to circumcision, as it also
did in the rest of the righteous who pleased God: and in these last
times, it again sprang up among mankind through the coming of the Lord.
But circumcision and the law of works occupied the intervening
period. <span id="fr_4142"></span>[4143](#fn_4142)

<span id="ix.vi.xxvi-p5"></span>2. <span
id="ix.vi.xxvi-p5.1"></span>This fact is indeed set forth by many other
\[occurrences\], but typically by \[the history of\] Thamar, Judah’s
daughter-in-law. <span id="fr_4143"></span>[4144](#fn_4143) For when she
had conceived twins, one of them put forth his hand first; and as the
midwife supposed that he was the first-born, she bound a scarlet token
on his hand. But after this had been done, and he had drawn back his
hand, his brother Phares came forth the first; then, after him, Zara,
upon whom was the scarlet line, \[was born\] the second: the Scripture
clearly pointing out that people which possessed the scarlet sign, that
is, faith in a state of circumcision, which was shown beforehand,
indeed, in the patriarchs first; but after that withdrawn, that his
brother might be born; and also, in like manner, him who was the elder,
as being born in the second place, \[him\] who was distinguished by the
scarlet token which was \[fastened\] on him, that is, the passion of the
Just One, which was prefigured from the beginning in Abel, and described
by the prophets, but perfected in the last times in the Son of God.

<span id="ix.vi.xxvi-p7"></span>3. For it was requisite that certain
facts should be announced beforehand by the fathers in a paternal
manner, and others prefigured by the prophets in a legal one, but
others, described after the form of Christ, by those who have received
the adoption; while in one God are all things shown forth. For although
Abraham was one, he did in himself prefigure the two covenants, in which
some indeed have sown, while others have reaped; for it is said, “In
this is the saying true, that it is one ‘people’ who sows, but another
who shall reap;” <span id="fr_4144"></span>[4145](#fn_4144) but it is
one God who bestows things suitable upon both—seed to the sower, but
bread for the reaper to eat. Just as it is one that planteth, and
another who watereth, but one God who giveth the increase. <span
id="fr_4145"></span>[4146](#fn_4145) For the patriarchs and prophets
sowed the word \[concerning\] Christ, but the Church reaped, that is,
received the fruit. For this reason, too, do these very men (the
prophets) also pray to have a dwelling-place in it, as Jeremiah says,
“Who will give me in the desert the last dwelling-place?” <span
id="fr_4146"></span>[4147](#fn_4146) in order that both the sower and
the reaper may rejoice together in the kingdom of Christ, who is present
with all those who were from the beginning approved by God, who granted
them His Word to be present with them. <span
