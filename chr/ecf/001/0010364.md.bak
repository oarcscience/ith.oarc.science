<span id="vii.ii.iv-p2"></span><span id="vii.ii.iv-p2.1"></span><span
id="vii.ii.iv-p2.2"></span>As the elders who saw John the disciple of
the Lord remembered that they had heard from him how the Lord taught in
regard to those times, and said\]: “The days will come in which vines
shall grow, having each ten thousand branches, and in each branch ten
thousand twigs, and in each true twig ten thousand shoots, and in every
one of the shoots ten thousand clusters, and on every one of the
clusters ten thousand grapes, and every grape when pressed will give
five-and-twenty metretes of wine. And when any one of the saints shall
lay hold of a cluster, another shall cry out, ‘I am a better cluster,
take me; bless the Lord through me.’ In like manner, \[He said\] that a
grain of wheat would <span id="page_154">p. 154</span> <span
id="vii.ii.iv-Page_154"></span> produce ten thousand ears, and that
every ear would have ten thousand grains, and every grain would yield
ten pounds of clear, pure, fine flour; and that apples, and seeds, and
grass would produce in similar proportions; and that all animals,
feeding then only on the productions of the earth, would become
peaceable and harmonious, and be in perfect subjection to man.” <span
id="fr_1745"></span>[1746](#fn_1745.md) \[Testimony is borne to these
things in writing by Papias, an ancient man, who was a hearer of John
and a friend of Polycarp, in the fourth of his books; for five books
were composed by him. And he added, saying, “Now these things are
credible to believers. <span id="vii.ii.iv-p3.1"></span>And Judas the
traitor,” says he, “not believing, and asking, ‘How shall such growths
be accomplished by the Lord?’ the Lord said, ‘They shall see who shall
come to them.’ These, then, are the times mentioned by the prophet
Isaiah: ‘And the wolf shall lie, down with the lamb,’ etc. ([Isa. xi.
6](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#006.md)<span id="vii.ii.iv-p3.2"></span>
ff.).”\]
