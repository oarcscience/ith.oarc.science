### <span id="ix.ii.xxvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXVI.—Doctrines of Cerinthus, the Ebionites, and Nicolaitanes.

<span id="ix.ii.xxvii-p1"></span>1. <span
id="ix.ii.xxvii-p1.1"></span>Cerinthus, again, a man who was
educated <span id="fr_2954"></span>[2955](#fn_2954) in the wisdom of the
Egyptians, taught that the world was not made by the primary God, but by
a certain Power far separated from him, and at a distance from that
Principality who is supreme <span id="page_352">p. 352</span> <span
id="ix.ii.xxvii-Page_352"></span> over the universe, and ignorant of him
who is above all. He represented Jesus as having not been born of a
virgin, but as being the son of Joseph and Mary according to the
ordinary course of human generation, while he nevertheless was more
righteous, prudent, and wise than other men. Moreover, after his
baptism, Christ descended upon him in the form of a dove from the
Supreme Ruler, and that then he proclaimed the unknown Father, and
performed miracles. But at last Christ departed from Jesus, and that
then Jesus suffered and rose again, while Christ remained impassible,
inasmuch as he was a spiritual being.

<span id="ix.ii.xxvii-p3"></span>2. <span
id="ix.ii.xxvii-p3.1"></span>Those who are called Ebionites agree that
the world was made by God; but their opinions with respect to the Lord
are similar to those of Cerinthus and Carpocrates. They use the Gospel
according to Matthew only, and repudiate the Apostle Paul, maintaining
that he was an apostate from the law. As to the prophetical writings,
they endeavour to expound them in a somewhat singular manner: they
practise circumcision, persevere in the observance of those customs
which are enjoined by the law, and are so Judaic in their style of life,
that they even adore Jerusalem as if it were the house of God.

<span id="ix.ii.xxvii-p4"></span>3. <span
id="ix.ii.xxvii-p4.1"></span>The Nicolaitanes are the followers of that
Nicolas who was one of the seven first ordained to the diaconate by the
apostles. <span id="fr_2955"></span>[2956](#fn_2955) They lead lives of
unrestrained indulgence. The character of these men is very plainly
pointed out in the Apocalypse of John, \[when they are represented\] as
teaching that it is a matter of indifference to practise adultery, and
to eat things sacrificed to idols. Wherefore the Word has also spoken of
them thus: “But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the
Nicolaitanes, which I also hate.” <span
