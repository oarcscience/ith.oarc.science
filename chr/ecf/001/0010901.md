### <span id="ix.viii.xxvi-p0.1"></span>XXVI.

<span id="ix.viii.xxvi-p1"></span><span
id="ix.viii.xxvi-p1.1"></span>Know <span
id="fr_4839"></span>[4840](#fn_4839) thou that every man is either empty
or full. For if he has not the Holy Spirit, he has no knowledge of the
Creator; he has not received Jesus Christ the Life; he knows not the
Father who is in heaven; if he does not live after the dictates of
reason, after the heavenly law, he is not a sober-minded person, nor
does he act uprightly: such an one is empty. If, on the other hand, he
receives God, who says, “I will dwell with them, and walk in them, and I
will be their God,” <span id="fr_4840"></span>[4841](#fn_4840) such an
one is not empty, but full.
