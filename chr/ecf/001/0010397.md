### <span id="viii.ii.xxiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXIV.—Varieties of heathen worship.

<span id="viii.ii.xxiv-p1"></span><span
id="viii.ii.xxiv-p1.1"></span><span id="viii.ii.xxiv-p1.2"></span>In the
first place \[we furnish proof\], because, though we say things similar
to what the Greeks say, we only are hated on account of the name of
Christ, and though we do no wrong, are put to death as sinners; other
men in other places worshipping trees and rivers, and mice and cats and
crocodiles, and many irrational animals. Nor are the same animals
esteemed by all; but in one place one is worshipped, and another in
another, so that all are profane in the judgment of one another, on
account of their not worshipping the same objects. And this is the sole
accusation you bring against us, that we do not reverence the same gods
as you do, nor offer to the dead libations and the savour of fat, and
crowns for their statues, <span id="fr_1815"></span>[1816](#fn_1815) and
sacrifices. For you very well know that the same animals are with some
esteemed gods, with others wild beasts, and with others sacrificial
victims.

<span id="viii.ii.xxiv-p2"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.ii.xxiv-p2.1"></span>ἐν γραφαῖς στεφάνους</span>. The only
conjecture which seems at all probable is that of the Benedictine editor
followed here. \[Grabe after Salmasius reads <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.ii.xxiv-p2.2"></span>ἐν ῥαφαῖς</span> and quotes Martial,
*Sutilis aptetur rosa crinibus*. Translate, “patch-work garlands.”\]
