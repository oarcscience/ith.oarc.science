### <span id="v.vii.x-p0.1"></span>Chapter X.—Acknowledgment of their kindness.

<span id="v.vii.x-p1"></span>Ye have done well in receiving Philo and
Rheus Agathopus as servants <span id="fr_1039"></span>[1040](#fn_1039.md)
of Christ our God, who have followed me for the sake of God, and who
give thanks to the Lord in your behalf, because ye have in every way
refreshed them. None of these things shall be lost to you. <span
id="v.vii.x-p2.1"></span>May my spirit be for you, <span
id="fr_1040"></span>[1041](#fn_1040.md) and my bonds, which ye have not
despised or been ashamed of; nor shall Jesus Christ, our perfect hope,
be ashamed of you.

<span id="v.vii.x-p4"></span>Ye have done well in receiving Philo, and
Gaius, and Agathopus, who, being the servants <span
id="fr_1041"></span>[1042](#fn_1041.md) of Christ, have followed me for the
sake of God, and who greatly bless the Lord in your behalf, because ye
have in every way refreshed them. None of those things which ye have
done to them shall be passed by without being reckoned unto you. “The
Lord grant” to you “that ye may find mercy of the Lord in that
day!” <span id="fr_1042"></span>[1043](#fn_1042.md) <span
id="v.vii.x-p6.2"></span>May my spirit be for you, <span
id="fr_1043"></span>[1044](#fn_1043.md) and my bonds, which ye have not
despised or been ashamed of. Wherefore, neither shall Jesus Christ, our
perfect hope, be ashamed of you.
