### <span id="ii.ii.l-p0.1"></span>Chapter L.—Let us pray to be thought worthy of love.

<span id="ii.ii.l-p1"></span>Ye see, beloved, how great and wonderful a
thing is love, and that there is no declaring its perfection. Who is fit
to be found in it, except such as God has vouchsafed to render so? Let
us pray, therefore, and implore of His mercy, that we may live blameless
in love, free from all human partialities for one above another. All the
generations from Adam even unto this day have passed away; but those
who, through the grace of God, have been made perfect in love, now
possess a place among the godly, and shall be made manifest at the
revelation <span id="fr_223"></span>[224](#fn_223.md) of the kingdom of
Christ. For it is written, “Enter into thy secret chambers for a little
time, until my wrath and fury pass away; and I will remember a
propitious <span id="fr_224"></span>[225](#fn_224.md) day, and will raise
you up out of your graves.” <span id="fr_225"></span>[226](#fn_225.md)
Blessed are we, beloved, if we keep the commandments of God in the
harmony of love; that so through love our sins may be forgiven us. For
it is written, “Blessed are they whose transgressions are forgiven, and
whose sins are covered. Blessed is the man whose sin <span
id="page_19">p. 19</span> <span id="ii.ii.l-Page_19"></span> the Lord
will not impute to him, and in whose mouth there is no guile.” <span
id="fr_226"></span>[227](#fn_226.md) This blessedness cometh upon those who
have been chosen by God through Jesus Christ our Lord; to whom be glory
for ever and ever. Amen.
