### <span id="v.ii.x-p0.1"></span>Chapter X.—Exhortations to prayer, humility, etc.

<span id="v.ii.x-p1"></span><span id="v.ii.x-p1.1"></span><span
id="v.ii.x-p1.2"></span><span id="v.ii.x-p1.3"></span>And pray ye
without ceasing in behalf of other men. <span
id="v.ii.x-p1.4"></span>For there is in them hope of repentance that
they <span id="page_54">p. 54</span> <span id="v.ii.x-Page_54"></span>
may attain to God. See, <span id="fr_553"></span>[554](#fn_553) then,
that they be instructed by your works, if in no other way. <span
id="v.ii.x-p2.1"></span><span id="v.ii.x-p2.2"></span>Be ye meek in
response to their wrath, humble in opposition to their boasting: to
their blasphemies return <span id="fr_554"></span>[555](#fn_554) your
prayers; in contrast to their error, be ye stedfast <span
id="fr_555"></span>[556](#fn_555) in the faith; and for their cruelty,
manifest your gentleness. <span id="v.ii.x-p4.2"></span><span
id="v.ii.x-p4.3"></span>While we take care not to imitate their conduct,
let us be found their brethren in all true kindness; and let us seek to
be followers of the Lord (who ever more unjustly treated, more
destitute, more condemned?), that so no plant of the devil may be found
in you, but ye may remain in all holiness and sobriety in Jesus Christ,
both with respect to the flesh and spirit.

<span id="v.ii.x-p5"></span><span id="v.ii.x-p5.1"></span><span
id="v.ii.x-p5.2"></span><span id="v.ii.x-p5.3"></span>And pray ye
without ceasing in behalf of other men; for there is hope of the
repentance, that they may attain to God. For “cannot he that falls arise
again, and he that goes astray return?” <span
id="fr_556"></span>[557](#fn_556) Permit them, then, to be instructed by
you. Be ye therefore the ministers of God, and the mouth of Christ. For
thus saith the Lord, “If ye take forth the precious from the vile, ye
shall be as my mouth.” <span id="fr_557"></span>[558](#fn_557) <span
id="v.ii.x-p7.2"></span><span id="v.ii.x-p7.3"></span>Be ye humble in
response to their wrath; oppose to their blasphemies your earnest
prayers; while they go astray, stand ye stedfast in the faith. Conquer
ye their harsh temper by gentleness, their passion by meekness. For
“blessed are the meek;” <span id="fr_558"></span>[559](#fn_558) and
Moses was meek above all men; <span id="fr_559"></span>[560](#fn_559)
and David was exceeding meek. <span id="fr_560"></span>[561](#fn_560)
Wherefore Paul exhorts as follows: “The servant of the Lord must not
strive, but be gentle towards all men, apt to teach, patient, in
meekness instructing those that oppose themselves.” <span
id="fr_561"></span>[562](#fn_561) Do not seek to avenge yourselves on
those that injure you, for says \[the Scripture\], “If I have returned
evil to those who returned evil to me.” <span
id="fr_562"></span>[563](#fn_562) Let us make them brethren by our
kindness. For say ye to those that hate you, Ye are our brethren, that
the name of the Lord may be glorified. <span
id="v.ii.x-p12.2"></span>And let us imitate the Lord, “who, when He was
reviled, reviled not again;” <span id="fr_563"></span>[564](#fn_563)
when He was crucified, He answered not; “when He suffered, He threatened
not;” <span id="fr_564"></span>[565](#fn_564) but prayed for His
enemies, “Father, forgive them; they know not what they do.” <span
id="fr_565"></span>[566](#fn_565) If any one, the more he is injured,
displays the more patience, blessed is he. If any one is defrauded, if
any one is despised, for the name of the Lord, he truly is the servant
of Christ. Take heed that no plant of the devil be found among you, for
such a plant is bitter and salt. “Watch ye, and be ye sober,” <span
id="fr_566"></span>[567](#fn_566) in Christ Jesus.
