### <span id="v.ii.xxii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXI.—Conclusion.

<span id="v.ii.xxii-p1"></span><span id="v.ii.xxii-p1.1"></span>My soul
be for yours and theirs <span id="fr_626"></span>[627](#fn_626) whom,
for the honour of God, ye have sent to Smyrna; whence also I write to
you, giving thanks unto the Lord, and loving Polycarp even as I do you.
<span id="v.ii.xxii-p2.1"></span>Remember me, as Jesus Christ also
remembered you. <span id="v.ii.xxii-p2.2"></span>Pray ye for the Church
which is in Syria, whence I am led bound to Rome, being the last of the
faithful who are there, even as I have been thought worthy to be
chosen <span id="fr_627"></span>[628](#fn_627) to show forth the honour
of God. <span id="v.ii.xxii-p3.1"></span>Farewell in God the Father, and
in Jesus Christ, our common hope.

<span id="v.ii.xxii-p4"></span><span id="v.ii.xxii-p4.1"></span>My soul
be for yours and theirs <span id="fr_628"></span>[629](#fn_628) whom,
for the honour of God, ye have sent to Smyrna; whence also I write to
you, giving thanks to the Lord, and loving Polycarp even as I do you.
<span id="v.ii.xxii-p5.1"></span>Remember me, as Jesus Christ also
remembers you, who is blessed for evermore. <span
id="v.ii.xxii-p5.2"></span>Pray ye for the Church of Antioch which is in
Syria, whence I am led bound to Rome, being the last of the faithful
that are there, who <span id="fr_629"></span>[630](#fn_629) yet have
been thought worthy to carry these chains to the honour of God. <span
id="v.ii.xxii-p6.1"></span>Fare ye well in God the Father, and the Lord
Jesus Christ, our common hope, and in the Holy Ghost. Fare ye well.
Amen. Grace \[be with you\]. <span id="fr_630"></span>[631](#fn_630)
