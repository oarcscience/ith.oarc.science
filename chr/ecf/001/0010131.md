### <span id="v.ii.viii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VIII.—Renewed praise of the Ephesians.

<span id="v.ii.viii-p1"></span><span id="v.ii.viii-p1.1"></span>Let not
then any one deceive you, as indeed ye are not deceived, inasmuch as ye
are wholly devoted to God. For since there is no strife raging among you
which might distress you, ye are certainly living in accordance with
God’s will. I am far inferior to you, and require to be sanctified by
your Church of Ephesus, so renowned throughout the world. They that are
carnal cannot do those things which are spiritual, nor they that are
spiritual the things which are carnal; even as faith cannot do the works
of unbelief, <span id="page_53">p. 53</span> <span
id="v.ii.viii-Page_53"></span> nor unbelief the works of faith. But even
those things which ye do according to the flesh are spiritual; for ye do
all things in Jesus Christ.

<span id="v.ii.viii-p2"></span><span id="v.ii.viii-p2.1"></span>Let not
then any one deceive you, as indeed ye are not deceived; for ye are
wholly devoted to God. For when there is no evil desire within you,
which might defile and torment you, then do ye live in accordance with
the will of God, and are \[the servants\] of Christ. Cast ye out that
which defiles <span id="fr_538"></span>[539](#fn_538) you, who are of
the <span id="fr_539"></span>[540](#fn_539) most holy Church of the
Ephesians, which is so famous and celebrated throughout the world. They
that are carnal cannot do those things which are spiritual, nor they
that are spiritual the things which are carnal; even as faith cannot do
the works of unbelief, nor unbelief the works of faith. <span
id="v.ii.viii-p4.1"></span>But ye, being full of the Holy Spirit, do
nothing according to the flesh, but all things according to the Spirit.
Ye are complete in Christ Jesus, “who is the Saviour of all men,
specially of them that believe.” <span id="fr_540"></span>[541](#fn_540)
