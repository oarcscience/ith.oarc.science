### <span id="viii.ii.xvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVI.—Concerning patience and swearing.

<span id="viii.ii.xvi-p1"></span><span
id="viii.ii.xvi-p1.1"></span><span id="viii.ii.xvi-p1.2"></span><span
id="viii.ii.xvi-p1.3"></span>And concerning our being patient of
injuries, and ready to serve all, and free from anger, this is what He
said: “To him that smiteth thee on the one cheek, offer also the other;
and him that taketh away thy cloak or coat, forbid not. And whosoever
shall be angry, is in danger of the fire. And every one that compelleth
thee to go with him a mile, follow him two. And let your good works
shine before men, that they, seeing them, may glorify your Father which
is in heaven.” <span id="fr_1793"></span>[1794](#fn_1793.md) For we ought
not to strive; neither has He desired us to be imitators of wicked men,
but He has exhorted us to lead all men, by patience and gentleness, from
shame and the love of evil. And this indeed is proved in the case of
many who once were of your way of thinking, but have changed their
violent and tyrannical disposition, being overcome either by the
constancy which they have witnessed in their neighbours’ lives, <span
id="fr_1794"></span>[1795](#fn_1794.md) or by the extraordinary forbearance
they have observed in their fellow-travellers when defrauded, or by the
honesty of those with whom they have transacted business.

<span id="viii.ii.xvi-p4"></span><span id="viii.ii.xvi-p4.1"></span>And
with regard to our not swearing at all, and always speaking the truth,
He enjoined as follows: “Swear not at all; but let your yea be yea, and
your nay, nay; for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.” <span
id="fr_1795"></span>[1796](#fn_1795.md) And that we ought to worship God
alone, He thus persuaded us: “The greatest commandment is, Thou shalt
worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shall thou serve, with all thy
heart, and with all thy strength, the Lord God that made thee.” <span
id="fr_1796"></span>[1797](#fn_1796.md) And when a certain man came to Him
and said, “Good Master,” He answered and said, “There is none good but
God only, who made all things.” <span
id="fr_1797"></span>[1798](#fn_1797.md) And let those who are not found
living as He taught, be understood to be no Christians, even though they
profess with the lip the precepts of Christ; for not those who make
profession, but those who do the works, shall be saved, according to His
word: “Not every one who saith to Me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the
kingdom of heaven, but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in
heaven. For whosoever heareth Me, and doeth My sayings, heareth Him that
sent Me. And many will say unto Me, Lord, Lord, have we not eaten and
drunk in Thy name, and done wonders? And then will I say unto them,
Depart from Me, ye workers of iniquity. Then shall there be wailing and
gnashing of teeth, when the righteous shall shine as the sun, and the
wicked are sent into everlasting fire. For many shall come in My name,
clothed outwardly in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly being ravening
wolves. By their works ye shall know them. And every tree that bringeth
not forth good fruit, is hewn down and cast into the fire.” <span
id="fr_1798"></span>[1799](#fn_1798.md) And as to those who are not living
pursuant to these His teachings, and are Christians only in name, we
demand that all such be punished by you.
