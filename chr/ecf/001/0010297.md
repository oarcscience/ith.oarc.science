### <span id="v.xvii.ix-p0.1"></span>Chapter IX.—Continuation: ignorance of Satan.

<span id="v.xvii.ix-p1"></span><span id="v.xvii.ix-p1.1"></span>Seeing
these things, thou wast in utter perplexity. <span
id="fr_1333"></span>[1334](#fn_1333.md) And thou wast ignorant that it was
a virgin that should bring forth; but the angels’ song of praise struck
thee with astonishment, as well as the adoration of the Magi, and the
appearance of the star. Thou didst revert to thy state of \[wilful\]
ignorance, because all the circumstances seemed to thee trifling; <span
id="fr_1334"></span>[1335](#fn_1334.md) for thou didst deem the
swaddling-bands, the circumcision, and the nourishment by means of milk
contemptible: <span id="fr_1335"></span>[1336](#fn_1335.md) these things
appeared to thee unworthy of God. Again, thou didst behold a man who
remained forty days and nights without tasting human food, along with
ministering angels at whose presence thou didst shudder, when first of
all thou hadst seen Him baptized as a common man, and knewest not the
reason thereof. But after His \[lengthened\] fast thou didst again
assume thy wonted audacity, and didst tempt Him when hungry, as if He
had been an ordinary man, not knowing who He was. For thou saidst, “If
thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.” <span
id="fr_1336"></span>[1337](#fn_1336.md) Now, this expression, “If thou be
the Son,” is an indication of ignorance. For if thou hadst possessed
real knowledge, thou wouldst have understood that the Creator can with
equal ease both create what does not exist, and change that which
already has a being. And thou temptedst by means of hunger <span
id="fr_1337"></span>[1338](#fn_1337.md) Him who nourisheth all that require
food. And thou temptedst the very “Lord of glory,” <span
id="fr_1338"></span>[1339](#fn_1338.md) forgetting in thy malevolence that
“man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth
out of the mouth of God.” For if thou hadst known that He was the Son of
God, thou wouldst also have understood that He who had kept his <span
id="fr_1339"></span>[1340](#fn_1339.md) body from feeling any want for
forty days and as many nights, could have also done the same for ever.
Why, then, does He suffer hunger? In order to prove that He had assumed
a body subject to the same feelings as those of ordinary men. By the
first fact He showed that He was God, and by the second that He was also
man.
