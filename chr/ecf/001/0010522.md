### <span id="viii.iv.lxi-p0.1"></span>Chapter LXI—Wisdom is begotten of the Father, as fire from fire.

<span id="viii.iv.lxi-p1"></span><span id="viii.iv.lxi-p1.1"></span>“I
shall give you another testimony, my friends,” said I, “from the
Scriptures, that God begat before all creatures a Beginning, <span
id="fr_2166"></span>[2167](#fn_2166) \[who was\] a certain rational
power \[proceeding\] from Himself, who is called by the Holy Spirit, now
the Glory of the Lord, now the Son, again Wisdom, again an Angel, then
God, and then Lord and Logos; and on another occasion He calls Himself
Captain, when He appeared in human form to Joshua the son of Nave (Nun).
For He can be called by all those names, since He ministers to the
Father’s will, and since He was begotten of the Father by an act of
will; <span id="fr_2167"></span>[2168](#fn_2167) just as we see <span
id="fr_2168"></span>[2169](#fn_2168) happening among ourselves: for when
we give out some word, we beget the word; yet not by abscission, so as
to lessen the word <span id="fr_2169"></span>[2170](#fn_2169) \[which
remains\] in us, when we give it out: and just as we see also happening
in the case of a fire, which is not lessened when it has kindled
\[another\], but remains the same; and that which has been kindled by it
likewise appears to exist by itself, not diminishing that from which it
was kindled. The Word of Wisdom, who is Himself this God begotten of the
Father of all things, and Word, and Wisdom, and Power, and the Glory of
the Begetter, will bear evidence to me, when He speaks by Solomon the
following: ‘If I shall declare to you what happens daily, I shall call
to mind events from everlasting, and review them. The Lord made me the
<span id="page_228">p. 228</span> <span
id="viii.iv.lxi-Page_228"></span> beginning of His ways for His works.
From everlasting He established me in the beginning, before He had made
the earth, and before He had made the deeps, before the springs of the
waters had issued forth, before the mountains had been established.
Before all the hills He begets me. God made the country, and the desert,
and the highest inhabited places under the sky. When He made ready the
heavens, I was along with Him, and when He set up His throne on the
winds: when He made the high clouds strong, and the springs of the deep
safe, when He made the foundations of the earth, I was with Him
arranging. I was that in which He rejoiced; daily and at all times I
delighted in His countenance, because He delighted in the finishing of
the habitable world, and delighted in the sons of men. Now, therefore, O
son, hear me. Blessed is the man who shall listen to me, and the mortal
who shall keep my ways, watching <span
id="fr_2170"></span>[2171](#fn_2170) daily at my doors, observing the
posts of my ingoings. For my outgoings are the outgoings of life, and
\[my\] will has been prepared by the Lord. But they who sin against me,
trespass against their own souls; and they who hate me love
death.’ <span id="fr_2171"></span>[2172](#fn_2171)

<span id="viii.iv.lxi-p2"></span> Or, “in the beginning, before all
creatures.” \[Justin’s reference to [Josh. i.
13-15](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#013)<span
id="viii.iv.lxi-p2.1"></span> deserves special consideration; for he
supposes that the true Joshua (<span class="upper"><span
id="viii.iv.lxi-p2.2"></span>Jesus</span>) was the substance, and the
true “captain of salvation,” of whom this one was but a shadow ([Heb.
iv. 8](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#008)<span
id="viii.iv.lxi-p2.3"></span>, *margin*), type, and pledge. See cap.

<span id="viii.iv.lxi-p3"></span> The act of will or volition is on the
part of the Father.

<span id="viii.iv.lxi-p4"></span> Or, “Do we not see,” etc.

<span id="fn_2169"></span>[227:2170](0010522.htm#fr_2169) <span
id="viii.iv.lxi-p4.1"></span>

<span id="viii.iv.lxi-p5"></span> The word, <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.iv.lxi-p5.1"></span>λόγος</span> translated “word,” means both
the thinking power or reason which produces ideas and the expression of
these ideas. And Justin passes here from the one meaning to the other.
When we utter a thought, the utterance of it does not diminish the power
of thought in us, though in one sense the thought has gone away from us.

<span id="viii.iv.lxi-p6"></span> The <span class="upper"><span
id="viii.iv.lxi-p6.1"></span>mss.</span> of Justin read “sleeping,” but
this is regarded as the mistake of some careless transcriber.
