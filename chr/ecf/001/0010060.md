### <span id="ii.ii.lv-p0.1"></span>Chapter LV.—Examples of such love.

<span id="ii.ii.lv-p1"></span><span id="ii.ii.lv-p1.1"></span><span
id="ii.ii.lv-p1.2"></span>To bring forward some examples from among the
heathen: Many kings and princes, in times of pestilence, when they had
been instructed by an oracle, have given themselves up to death, in
order that by their own blood they might deliver their fellow-citizens
\[from destruction\]. Many have gone forth from their own cities, that
so sedition might be brought to an end within <span id="page_20">p.
20</span> <span id="ii.ii.lv-Page_20"></span> them. We know many among
ourselves who have given themselves up to bonds, in order that they
might ransom others. Many, too, have surrendered themselves to slavery,
that with the price <span id="fr_243"></span>[244](#fn_243) which they
received for themselves, they might provide food for others. Many women
also, being strengthened by the grace of God, have performed numerous
manly exploits. <span id="ii.ii.lv-p2.3"></span>The blessed Judith, when
her city was besieged, asked of the elders permission to go forth into
the camp of the strangers; and, exposing herself to danger, she went out
for the love which she bare to her country and people then besieged; and
the Lord delivered Holofernes into the hands of a woman. <span
id="fr_244"></span>[245](#fn_244) <span id="ii.ii.lv-p3.2"></span>Esther
also, being perfect in faith, exposed herself to no less danger, in
order to deliver the twelve tribes of Israel from impending destruction.
For with fasting and humiliation she entreated the everlasting God, who
seeth all things; and He, perceiving the humility of her spirit,
delivered the people for whose sake she had encountered peril. <span
