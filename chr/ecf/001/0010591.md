### <span id="viii.iv.cxxx-p0.1"></span>Chapter CXXX.—He returns to the conversion of the Gentiles, and shows that it was foretold.

<span id="viii.iv.cxxx-p1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.cxxx-p1.1"></span>And when all had given assent, I said: “I
would now adduce some passages which I had not recounted before. They
are recorded by the faithful servant Moses in parable, and are as
follows: ‘Rejoice, O ye heavens, with Him, and let all the angels of God
worship Him;’ ” <span id="fr_2457"></span>[2458](#fn_2457.md) and I added
what follows of the passage: “ ‘Rejoice, O ye nations, with His people,
and let all the angels of God be strengthened in Him: for the blood of
His sons He avenges, and will avenge, and will recompense His enemies
with vengeance, and will recompense those that hate Him; and the Lord
will purify the land of His people.’ And by these words He declares that
we, the nations, rejoice with His people, —to wit, Abraham, and Isaac,
and Jacob, and the prophets, and, in short, all of that people who are
well-pleasing to God, according to what has been already agreed on
between us. But we will not receive it of all your nation; since we know
from Isaiah <span id="fr_2458"></span>[2459](#fn_2458.md) that the members
of those who have transgressed shall be consumed <span id="page_265">p.
265</span> <span id="viii.iv.cxxx-Page_265"></span> by the worm and
unquenchable fire, remaining immortal; so that they become a spectacle
to all flesh. <span id="viii.iv.cxxx-p3.2"></span>But in addition to
these, I wish, sirs,” said I, “to add some other passages from the very
words of Moses, from which you may understand that God has from of old
dispersed all men according to their kindreds and tongues; and out of
all kindreds has taken to Himself your kindred, a useless, disobedient,
and faithless generation; and has shown that those who were selected out
of every nation have obeyed His will through Christ,—whom He calls also
Jacob, and names Israel, —and these, then, as I mentioned fully
previously, must be Jacob and Israel. For when He says, ‘Rejoice, O ye
nations, with His people,’ He allots the same inheritance to them, and
does not call them by the same name; <span
id="fr_2459"></span>[2460](#fn_2459.md) but when He says that they as
Gentiles rejoice with His people, He calls them Gentiles to reproach
you. For even as you provoked Him to anger by your idolatry, so also He
has deemed those who were idolaters worthy of knowing His will, and of
inheriting His inheritance.

<span id="viii.iv.cxxx-p4"></span> The reading is, “and calls them by
the same name.” But the whole argument shows that the Jews and Gentiles
are distinguished by name. \[But that Gentiles are also called (Israel)
by the same name is the point here.\]
