### <span id="ii.ii.vii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VII.—An exhortation to repentance.

<span id="ii.ii.vii-p1"></span><span id="ii.ii.vii-p1.1"></span>These
things, beloved, we write unto you, not merely to admonish you of your
duty, but also to remind ourselves. For we are struggling on the same
arena, and the same conflict is assigned to both of us. Wherefore let us
give up vain and fruitless cares, and approach to the glorious and
venerable rule of our holy calling. Let us attend to what is good,
pleasing, and acceptable in the sight of Him who formed us. Let us look
stedfastly to the blood of Christ, and see how precious that blood is to
God, <span id="fr_34"></span>[35](#fn_34.md) which, having been shed for
our salvation, has set the grace of repentance before the whole world.
Let us turn to every age that has passed, and learn that, from
generation to generation, the Lord has granted a place of repentance to
all such as would be converted unto Him. <span
id="ii.ii.vii-p2.1"></span>Noah preached repentance, and as many as
listened to him were saved. <span id="fr_35"></span>[36](#fn_35.md) <span
id="ii.ii.vii-p3.4"></span>Jonah proclaimed destruction to the
Ninevites; <span id="fr_36"></span>[37](#fn_36.md) but they, repenting of
their sins, propitiated God by prayer, and obtained salvation, although
they were aliens \[to the covenant\] of God.
