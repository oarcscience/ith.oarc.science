### <span id="ix.vii.xxiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXIII.—The devil is well practised in falsehood, by which Adam having been led astray, sinned on the sixth day of the creation, in which day also he has been renewed by Christ.

<span id="ix.vii.xxiv-p1"></span>1. <span
id="ix.vii.xxiv-p1.1"></span>He had indeed been already accustomed to
lie against God, for the purpose of leading men astray. For at the
beginning, when God had given to man a variety of things for food, while
He commanded him not to eat of one tree only, as the Scripture tells us
that God said to Adam: “From every tree which is in the garden thou
shalt eat food; but from the tree of knowledge of good and evil, from
this ye shall not eat: for in the day that ye shall eat of it, ye shall
die by death;” <span id="fr_4647"></span>[4648](#fn_4647.md) he then, lying
against the Lord, tempted man, as the Scripture says that the serpent
said to the woman: “Has God indeed said this, Ye shall not eat from
every tree of the garden?” <span id="fr_4648"></span>[4649](#fn_4648.md)
And when she had exposed the falsehood, and simply related the command,
as He had said, “From every tree of the garden we shall eat; but of the
fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye
shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die:” <span
id="fr_4649"></span>[4650](#fn_4649.md) when he had \[thus\] learned from
the woman the command of God, having brought his cunning into play, he
finally deceived her by a falsehood, saying, “Ye shall not die by death;
for God knew that in the day ye shall eat of it your eyes shall be
opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.” <span
id="fr_4650"></span>[4651](#fn_4650.md) In the first place, then, in the
garden of God he disputed about God, as if God was not there, for he was
ignorant of the greatness of God; and then, in the next place, after he
had learned from the woman that God had said that they should die if
they tasted the aforesaid tree, opening his mouth, he uttered the third
falsehood, “Ye shall not die by death.” But that God was true, and the
serpent a liar, was proved by the result, death having passed upon them
who had eaten. For along with the fruit they did also fall under the
power of death, because they did eat in disobedience; and disobedience
to God entails death. Wherefore, as they became forfeit to death, from
that \[moment\] they were handed over to it.

<span id="ix.vii.xxiv-p6"></span>2. <span
id="ix.vii.xxiv-p6.1"></span><span id="ix.vii.xxiv-p6.2"></span>Thus,
then, in the day that they did eat, in the same did they die, and became
death’s debtors, since it was one day of the creation. For it is said,
“There was made in the evening, and there was made in the morning, one
day.” Now in this same day that they did eat, in that also did they die.
But according to the cycle and progress of the days, after which one is
termed first, another second, and another third, if anybody seeks
diligently to learn upon what day out of the seven it was that Adam
died, he will find it by examining the dispensation of the Lord. For by
summing up in Himself the whole human race from the beginning to the
end, He has also summed up its death. From this it is clear that the
Lord suffered death, in obedience to His Father, upon that day on which
Adam died while he disobeyed God. Now he died on the same day in which
he did eat. For God said, “In that day on which ye shall eat of it, ye
shall die by death.” The Lord, therefore, recapitulating in Himself this
day, underwent His sufferings upon the day preceding the Sabbath, that
is, the sixth day of the creation, on which day man was created; thus
granting him a second creation by means of His passion, which is that
\[creation\] out of death. And there are some, again, who relegate the
death of Adam to the thousandth year; for since “a day of the Lord is as
a thousand years,” <span id="fr_4651"></span>[4652](#fn_4651.md) he did not
overstep the thousand years, but died within them, thus bearing out the
sentence of his sin. Whether, therefore, with respect to disobedience,
which is death; whether <span id="page_552">p. 552</span> <span
id="ix.vii.xxiv-Page_552"></span> \[we consider\] that, on account of
that, they were delivered over to death, and made debtors to it; whether
with respect to \[the fact that on\] one and the same day on which they
ate they also died (for it is one day of the creation); whether \[we
regard this point\], that, with respect to this cycle of days, they died
on the day in which they did also eat, that is, the day of the
preparation, which is termed “the pure supper,” that is, the sixth day
of the feast, which the Lord also exhibited when He suffered on that
day; or whether \[we reflect\] that he (Adam) did not overstep the
thousand years, but died within their limit,—it follows that, in regard
to all these significations, God is indeed true. For they died who
tasted of the tree; and the serpent is proved a liar and a murderer, as
the Lord said of him: “For he is a murderer from the beginning, and the
truth is not in him.” <span id="fr_4652"></span>[4653](#fn_4652.md)
