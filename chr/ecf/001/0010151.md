### <span id="v.iii.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.—Death is the fate of all such.

<span id="v.iii.v-p1"></span>Seeing, then, all things have an end, these
two things are simultaneously set before us—death and life; and every
one shall go unto his own place. For as there are two kinds of coins,
the one of God, the other of the world, and each of these has its
special character stamped upon it, \[so is it also here.\] <span
id="fr_663"></span>[664](#fn_663) The unbelieving are of this world; but
the believing have, in love, the character of God the Father by Jesus
Christ, by whom, if we are not in readiness to die into His
passion, <span id="fr_664"></span>[665](#fn_664) His life is not in us.

<span id="v.iii.v-p4"></span><span id="v.iii.v-p4.1"></span>Seeing,
then, all things have an end, and there is set before us life upon our
observance \[of God’s precepts\], but death as the result of
disobedience, and every one, according to the choice he makes, shall go
to his own place, let us flee from death, and make choice of life. For I
remark, that two different characters are found among men—the one true
coin, the other spurious. The truly devout man is the right kind of
coin, stamped by God Himself. The ungodly man, again, is false coin,
unlawful, spurious, counterfeit, wrought not by God, but by the devil. I
do not mean to say that there are two different human natures, but that
there is one humanity, sometimes belonging to God, and sometimes to the
devil. If any one is truly religious, he is a man of God; but if he is
irreligious, he is a man of the devil, made such, not by nature, but by
his own choice. The unbelieving bear the image of the prince of
wickedness. The believing possess the image of their Prince, God the
Father, and Jesus Christ, through whom, if we are not in readiness to
die for the truth into His passion, <span
id="fr_665"></span>[666](#fn_665) His life is not in us.
