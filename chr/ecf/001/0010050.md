### <span id="ii.ii.xlv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XLV.—It is the part of the wicked to vex the righteous.

<span id="ii.ii.xlv-p1"></span><span id="ii.ii.xlv-p1.1"></span><span
id="ii.ii.xlv-p1.2"></span><span id="ii.ii.xlv-p1.3"></span>Ye are fond
of contention, brethren, and full of zeal about things which do not
pertain to salvation. <span id="ii.ii.xlv-p1.4"></span><span
id="ii.ii.xlv-p1.5"></span>Look carefully into the Scriptures, which are
the true utterances of the Holy Spirit. Observe <span
id="fr_193"></span>[194](#fn_193) that nothing of an unjust or
counterfeit character is written in them. There <span
id="fr_194"></span>[195](#fn_194) you will not find that the righteous
were cast off by men who themselves were holy. The righteous were indeed
persecuted, but only by the wicked. They were cast into prison, but only
by the unholy; they were stoned, but only by transgressors; they were
slain, but only by the accursed, and such as had conceived an
unrighteous envy against them. Exposed to such sufferings, they endured
them gloriously. For what shall we say, brethren? Was Daniel <span
id="fr_195"></span>[196](#fn_195) cast into the den of lions by such as
feared God? Were Ananias, and Azarias, and Mishaël shut up in a
furnace <span id="fr_196"></span>[197](#fn_196) of fire by those who
observed <span id="fr_197"></span>[198](#fn_197) the great and glorious
worship of the Most High? Far from us be such a thought! Who, then, were
they that did such things? The hateful, and those full of all
wickedness, were roused to such a pitch of fury, that they inflicted
torture on those who served God with a holy and blameless purpose \[of
heart\], not knowing that the Most High is the Defender and Protector of
all such as with a pure conscience venerate <span
id="fr_198"></span>[199](#fn_198) His all-excellent name; to whom be
glory for ever and ever. Amen. But they who with confidence endured
\[these things\] are now heirs of glory and honour, and have been
exalted and made illustrious <span id="fr_199"></span>[200](#fn_199) by
God in their memorial for ever and ever. Amen.
