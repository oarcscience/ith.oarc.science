### <span id="ii.ii.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.—The sad state of the Corinthian church after sedition arose in it from envy and emulation.

<span id="ii.ii.iii-p1"></span><span id="ii.ii.iii-p1.1"></span><span
id="ii.ii.iii-p1.2"></span>Every kind of honour and happiness <span
id="fr_12"></span>[13](#fn_12) was bestowed upon you, and then was
fulfilled that which is written, “My beloved did eat and drink, and was
enlarged and became fat, and kicked.” <span
id="fr_13"></span>[14](#fn_13) Hence flowed emulation and envy, strife
and sedition, persecution and disorder, war and captivity. So the
worthless rose up against the honoured, those of no reputation <span
id="page_6">p. 6</span> <span id="ii.ii.iii-Page_6"></span> against such
as were renowned, the foolish against the wise, the young against those
advanced in years. <span id="ii.ii.iii-p3.2"></span><span
id="ii.ii.iii-p3.3"></span>For this reason righteousness and peace are
now far departed from you, inasmuch as every one abandons the fear of
God, and is become blind in His faith, <span
id="fr_14"></span>[15](#fn_14) neither walks in the ordinances of His
appointment, nor acts a part becoming a Christian, <span
id="fr_15"></span>[16](#fn_15) but walks after his own wicked lusts,
resuming the practice of an unrighteous and ungodly envy, by which death
itself entered into the world. <span id="fr_16"></span>[17](#fn_16)
