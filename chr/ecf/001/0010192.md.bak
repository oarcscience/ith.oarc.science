### <span id="v.vi.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.—Pray for me.

<span id="v.vi.v-p1"></span><span id="v.vi.v-p1.1"></span><span
id="v.vi.v-p1.2"></span>My brethren, I am greatly enlarged in loving
you; and rejoicing exceedingly \[over you\], I seek to secure your
safety. Yet it is not I, but Jesus Christ, for whose sake being bound I
fear the more, inasmuch as I am not yet perfect. But your prayer to God
shall make me perfect, that I may attain to that portion which through
mercy has been allotted me, while I flee to the Gospel as to the flesh
of Jesus, and to the apostles as to the presbytery of the Church. <span
id="v.vi.v-p1.3"></span><span id="v.vi.v-p1.4"></span>And let us also
love the prophets, because they too have proclaimed the Gospel, <span
id="fr_916"></span>[917](#fn_916.md) and placed their hope in Him, <span
id="fr_917"></span>[918](#fn_917.md) and waited for Him; in whom also
believing, they were saved, through union to Jesus Christ, being holy
men, worthy of love and admiration, having had witness borne to them by
Jesus Christ, and being reckoned along with \[us\] in the Gospel of the
common hope.

<span id="v.vi.v-p4"></span><span id="v.vi.v-p4.1"></span>My brethren, I
am greatly enlarged in loving you; and rejoicing exceedingly \[over
you\], I seek to secure your safety. Yet it is not I, but the Lord Jesus
through me; for whose sake being bound, I fear the more, for I am not
yet perfect. But your prayer to God shall make me perfect, that I may
attain that to which I have been called, while I flee to the Gospel as
to the flesh of Jesus Christ, and to the apostles as the presbytery of
the Church. <span id="v.vi.v-p4.2"></span>I do also love the prophets as
those who announced Christ, and as being partakers of the same Spirit
with the apostles. <span id="v.vi.v-p4.3"></span>For as the false
prophets and the false apostles drew \[to themselves\] one and the same
wicked, deceitful, and seducing <span id="fr_918"></span>[919](#fn_918.md)
spirit; so also did the prophets and the apostles receive from God,
through Jesus Christ, one and the same Holy Spirit, who is good, and
sovereign, <span id="fr_919"></span>[920](#fn_919.md) and true, and the
Author of \[saving\] knowledge. <span id="fr_920"></span>[921](#fn_920.md)
For there is one God of the Old and New Testament, “one Mediator between
God and men,” for the creation of both intelligent and sensitive beings,
and in order to exercise a beneficial and suitable providence \[over
them\]. There is also one Comforter, who displayed <span
id="fr_921"></span>[922](#fn_921.md) His power in Moses, and the prophets,
and apostles. All the saints, therefore, were saved by Christ, hoping in
Him, and waiting for Him; and they obtained through Him salvation, being
holy ones, worthy of love and admiration, having testimony borne to them
by Jesus Christ, in the Gospel of our common hope.
