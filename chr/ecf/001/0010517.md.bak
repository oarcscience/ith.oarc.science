### <span id="viii.iv.lvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter LVI.—God who appeared to Moses is distinguished from God the Father.

<span id="viii.iv.lvi-p1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.lvi-p1.1"></span><span id="viii.iv.lvi-p1.2"></span><span
id="viii.iv.lvi-p1.3"></span><span id="viii.iv.lvi-p1.4"></span>“Moses,
then, the blessed and faithful servant of God, declares that He who
appeared to Abraham under the oak in Mamre is God, sent with the two
angels in His company to judge Sodom by Another who remains ever in the
supercelestial places, invisible to all men, holding personal
intercourse with none, whom we believe to be Maker and Father of all
things; for he speaks thus: ‘God appeared to him under the oak in Mamre,
as he sat at his tent-door at noontide. And lifting up his eyes, he saw,
and behold, three men stood before him; and when he saw them, he ran to
meet them from the door of his tent; and he bowed himself toward the
ground, and said;’ ” <span id="fr_2124"></span>[2125](#fn_2124.md) (and so
on;) <span id="fr_2125"></span>[2126](#fn_2125.md) “ ‘Abraham gat up early
in the morning to the place where he stood before the Lord: and he
looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward the adjacent country, and
beheld, and, lo, a flame went up from the earth, like the smoke of a
furnace.’ ” And when I had made an end of quoting these words, I asked
them if they had understood them.

<span id="viii.iv.lvi-p4"></span>And they said they had understood them,
but that the passages adduced brought forward no proof that there is any
other God or Lord, or that the Holy Spirit says so, besides the Maker of
all things.

<span id="viii.iv.lvi-p5"></span>Then I replied, “I shall attempt to
persuade you, since you have understood the Scriptures, \[of the truth\]
of what I say, that there is, and that there is said to be, another God
and Lord subject to <span id="fr_2126"></span>[2127](#fn_2126.md) the Maker
of all things; who is also called an Angel, because He announces to men
whatsoever the Maker of all things—above whom there is no other
God—wishes to announce to them.” And quoting once more the previous
passage, I asked Trypho, “Do you think that God appeared to Abraham
under the oak in Mamre, as the Scripture asserts?”

<span id="viii.iv.lvi-p7"></span>He said, “Assuredly.”

<span id="viii.iv.lvi-p8"></span>“Was He one of those three,” I said,
“whom Abraham saw, and whom the Holy Spirit of prophecy describes as
men?”

<span id="viii.iv.lvi-p9"></span>He said, “No; but God appeared to him,
before the vision of the three. Then those three whom the Scripture
calls men, were angels; two of them sent to destroy Sodom, and one to
announce the joyful tidings to Sarah, that she would bear a son; for
which cause he was sent, and having accomplished his errand, went
away.” <span id="fr_2127"></span>[2128](#fn_2127.md)

<span id="viii.iv.lvi-p11"></span>“How then,” said I, “does the one of
the three, who was in the tent, and who said, ‘I shall return to thee
hereafter, and Sarah shall have a son,’ <span
id="fr_2128"></span>[2129](#fn_2128.md) appear to have returned when Sarah
had begotten a son, and to be there declared, by the prophetic word,
God? But that you may clearly discern what I say, listen to the words
expressly employed by Moses; they are these: ‘And Sarah saw the son of
Hagar the Egyptian bond-woman, whom she bore to Abraham, sporting with
Isaac her son, and said to Abraham, Cast out this bond-woman and her
son; for the son of this bond-woman shall not share the inheritance of
my son Isaac. And the matter seemed very grievous in Abraham’s sight,
because of his son. But God said to Abraham, Let it not be grievous in
thy sight because of the son, and because of the bond-woman. In all that
Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken to her voice; for in Isaac shall thy
seed be called.’ <span id="fr_2129"></span>[2130](#fn_2129.md) Have you
perceived, then, that He who said under the oak that He would return,
since He knew it would be necessary to advise Abraham to do what Sarah
wished him, came back as it is written; and is God, as the words
declare, when they so speak: ‘God said to Abraham, Let it not be
grievous in thy sight because of the son, and because of the
bond-woman?’ ” I inquired. And Trypho said, “Certainly; but you have not
proved from this that there is another God besides Him who appeared to
Abraham, and who also appeared to the other patriarchs and prophets. You
have proved, however, that we were wrong in believing that the three who
were in the tent with Abraham were all angels.”

<span id="viii.iv.lvi-p14"></span>I replied again, “If I could not have
proved to you from the Scriptures that one of those three is God, and is
called Angel, <span id="fr_2130"></span>[2131](#fn_2130.md) because, as I
already said, He brings messages to those to whom God the Maker of all
things wishes \[messages to be brought\], then in regard to Him who
appeared to Abraham on earth in human form in like manner as the two
angels who came with Him, and who was God even before the creation of
the world, it were reasonable for you to entertain the same belief as is
entertained by the whole of your nation.”

<span id="viii.iv.lvi-p16"></span>“Assuredly,” he said, “for up to this
moment this has been our belief.”

<span id="viii.iv.lvi-p17"></span>Then I replied, “Reverting to the
Scriptures, I shall endeavour to persuade you, that He who is said to
have appeared to Abraham, and to Jacob, and to Moses, and who is called
God, is distinct from Him who made all things,—numerically, I mean, not
\[distinct\] in will. For I affirm that He has never at any time
done <span id="fr_2131"></span>[2132](#fn_2131.md) anything <span
id="page_224">p. 224</span> <span id="viii.iv.lvi-Page_224"></span>
which He who made the world—above whom there is no other God—has not
wished Him both to do and to engage Himself with.”

<span id="viii.iv.lvi-p19"></span>And Trypho said, “Prove now that this
is the case, that we also may agree with you. For we do not understand
you to affirm that He has done or said anything contrary to the will of
the Maker of all things.”

<span id="viii.iv.lvi-p20"></span>Then I said, “The Scripture just
quoted by me will make this plain to you. It is thus: ‘The sun was risen
on the earth, and Lot entered into Segor (Zoar); and the Lord rained on
Sodom sulphur and fire from the Lord out of heaven, and overthrew these
cities and all the neighbourhood.’ ” <span
id="fr_2132"></span>[2133](#fn_2132.md)

<span id="viii.iv.lvi-p22"></span>Then the fourth of those who had
remained with Trypho said, “It <span
id="fr_2133"></span>[2134](#fn_2133.md) must therefore necessarily be said
that one of the two angels who went to Sodom, and is named by Moses in
the Scripture Lord, is different from Him who also is God and appeared
to Abraham.” <span id="fr_2134"></span>[2135](#fn_2134.md)

<span id="viii.iv.lvi-p25"></span>“It is not on this ground solely,” I
said, “that it must be admitted absolutely that some other one is called
Lord by the Holy Spirit besides Him who is considered Maker of all
things; not solely \[for what is said\] by Moses, but also \[for what is
said\] by David. For there is written by him: ‘The Lord says to my Lord,
Sit on My right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool,’ <span
id="fr_2135"></span>[2136](#fn_2135.md) as I have already quoted. And
again, in other words: ‘Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever. A
sceptre of equity is the sceptre of Thy kingdom: Thou hast loved
righteousness and hated iniquity: therefore God, even Thy God, hath
anointed Thee with the oil of gladness above Thy fellows.’ <span
id="fr_2136"></span>[2137](#fn_2136.md) If, therefore, you assert that the
Holy Spirit calls some other one God and Lord, besides the Father of all
things and His Christ, answer me; for I undertake to prove to you from
Scriptures themselves, that He whom the Scripture calls Lord is not one
of the two angels that went to Sodom, but He who was with them, and is
called God, that appeared to Abraham.”

<span id="viii.iv.lvi-p28"></span>And Trypho said, “Prove this; for, as
you see, the day advances, and we are not prepared for such perilous
replies; since never yet have we heard any man investigating, or
searching into, or proving these matters; nor would we have tolerated
your conversation, had you not referred everything to the
Scriptures: <span id="fr_2137"></span>[2138](#fn_2137.md) for you are very
zealous in adducing proofs from them; and you are of opinion that there
is no God above the Maker of all things.”

<span id="viii.iv.lvi-p30"></span>Then I replied, “You are aware, then,
that the Scripture says, ‘And the Lord said to Abraham, Why did Sarah
laugh, saying, Shall I truly conceive? for I am old. Is anything
impossible with God? At the time appointed shall I return to thee
according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.’ <span
id="fr_2138"></span>[2139](#fn_2138.md) And after a little interval: ‘And
the men rose up from thence, and looked towards Sodom and Gomorrah; and
Abraham went with them, to bring them on the way. And the Lord said, I
will not conceal from Abraham, my servant, what I do.’ <span
id="fr_2139"></span>[2140](#fn_2139.md) And again, after a little, it thus
says: ‘The Lord said, The cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, <span
id="fr_2140"></span>[2141](#fn_2140.md) and their sins are very grievous. I
will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to
their cry which has come unto me; and if not, that I may know. And the
men turned away thence, and went to Sodom. But Abraham was standing
before the Lord; and Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt Thou destroy the
righteous with the wicked?’ ” <span id="fr_2141"></span>[2142](#fn_2141.md)
(and so on, <span id="fr_2142"></span>[2143](#fn_2142.md) for I do not
think fit to write over again the same words, having written them all
before, but shall of necessity give those by which I established the
proof to Trypho and his companions. Then I proceeded to what follows, in
which these words are recorded:) “ ‘And the Lord went His way as soon as
He had left communing with Abraham; and \[Abraham\] went to his place.
And there came two angels to Sodom at even. And Lot sat in the gate of
Sodom;’ <span id="fr_2143"></span>[2144](#fn_2143.md) and what follows
until, ‘But the men put forth their hands, and pulled Lot into the house
to them, and shut to the door of the house;’ <span
id="fr_2144"></span>[2145](#fn_2144.md) and what follows till, ‘And the
angels laid hold on his hand, and on the hand of his wife, and on the
hands of his daughters, the Lord being merciful to him. And it came to
pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that they said, Save,
save thy life. Look not behind thee, nor stay in all the neighbourhood;
escape to the mountain, lest thou be taken along with \[them\]. And Lot
said to them, I beseech \[Thee\], O Lord, since Thy servant hath found
grace in Thy sight, and Thou hast magnified Thy righteousness, which
Thou showest towards me in saving my life; but I cannot escape to the
mountain, lest evil overtake me, and I die. Behold, this city is near to
flee unto, and it is small: there I shall be safe, since it is small;
and any soul shall live. And He said to him, Behold, I have accepted
thee <span id="fr_2145"></span>[2146](#fn_2145.md) also in this matter,
<span id="page_225">p. 225</span> <span
id="viii.iv.lvi-Page_225"></span> so as not to destroy the city for
which thou hast spoken. Make haste to save thyself there; for I shall
not do anything till thou be come thither. Therefore he called the name
of the city Segor (Zoar). The sun was risen upon the earth; and Lot
entered into Segor (Zoar). And the Lord rained on Sodom and Gomorrah
sulphur and fire from the Lord out of heaven; and He overthrew these
cities, and all the neighbourhood.’ ” <span
id="fr_2146"></span>[2147](#fn_2146.md) And after another pause I added:
“And now have you not perceived, my friends, that one of the three, who
is both God and Lord, and ministers to Him who is in the heavens, is
Lord of the two angels? For when \[the angels\] proceeded to Sodom, He
remained behind, and communed with Abraham in the words recorded by
Moses; and when He departed after the conversation, Abraham went back to
his place. And when he came \[to Sodom\], the two angels no longer
conversed with Lot, but Himself, as the Scripture makes evident; and He
is the Lord who received commission from the Lord who \[remains\] in the
heavens, i.e., the Maker of all things, to inflict upon Sodom and
Gomorrah the \[judgments\] which the Scripture describes in these terms:
‘The Lord rained down upon Sodom and Gomorrah sulphur and fire from the
Lord out of heaven.’ ”

“Jehovah-angel” of the Pentateuch, *passim*.\] In the various passages
in which Justin assigns the reason for Christ being called angel or

announce. The similarity between <span class="Greek"><span
