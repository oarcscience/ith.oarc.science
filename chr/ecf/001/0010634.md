### <span id="viii.vi.xxiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXIV.—Agreement of Plato and Homer.

<span id="viii.vi.xxiv-p1"></span><span
id="viii.vi.xxiv-p1.1"></span><span id="viii.vi.xxiv-p1.2"></span><span
id="viii.vi.xxiv-p1.3"></span><span id="viii.vi.xxiv-p1.4"></span>How,
then, does Plato banish Homer from his republic, since, in the embassy
to Achilles, he represents Phœnix as saying to Achilles, “Even the gods
themselves are not inflexible,” <span
id="fr_2555"></span>[2556](#fn_2555.md) though Homer said this not of the
king and Platonic maker of the gods, but of some of the multitude whom
the Greeks esteem as gods, as one can gather from Plato’s saying, “gods
of gods?” For Homer, by that golden chain, <span
id="fr_2556"></span>[2557](#fn_2556.md) refers all power and might to the
one highest <span id="page_283">p. 283</span> <span
id="viii.vi.xxiv-Page_283"></span> God. And the rest of the gods, he
said, were so far distant from his divinity, that he thought fit to name
them even along with men. At least he introduces Ulysses saying of
Hector to Achilles, “He is raging terribly, trusting in Zeus, and values
neither men nor gods.” <span id="fr_2557"></span>[2558](#fn_2557.md) In
this passage Homer seems to me without doubt to have learnt in Egypt,
like Plato, concerning the one God, and plainly and openly to declare
this, that he who trusts in the really existent God makes no account of
those that do not exist. For thus the poet, in another passage, and
employing another but equivalent word, to wit, a pronoun, made use of
the same participle employed by Plato to designate the really existent
God, concerning whom Plato said, “What that is which always exists, and
has no birth.” For not without a double sense does this expression of
Phœnix seem to have been used: “Not even if God Himself were to promise
me, that, having burnished off my old age, He should set me forth in the
flower of youth.” For the pronoun “Himself” signifies the really
existing God. For thus, too, the oracle which was given to you
concerning the Chaldæans and Hebrews signifies. For when some one
inquired what men had ever lived godly, you say the answer was:—

> <span id="viii.vi.xxiv-p4.1"></span>“Only the Chaldæans and the
> Hebrews found wisdom,  
> Worshipping God Himself, the unbegotten King.”
