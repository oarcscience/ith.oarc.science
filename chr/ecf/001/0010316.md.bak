### <span id="v.xix.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.—Salutations and good wishes.

<span id="v.xix.v-p1"></span>Avoid those that deny the passion of
Christ, and His birth according to the flesh: and there are many at
present who suffer under this disease. But it would be absurd to
admonish thee on other points, seeing that thou art perfect in every
good work and word, and able also to exhort others in Christ. <span
id="v.xix.v-p1.1"></span>Salute all that are like-minded with thyself,
and who hold fast to their salvation in Christ. The presbyters and
deacons, and above all the holy Hero, salute thee. Cassian my host
salutes thee, as well as my sister, his wife, and their very dear
children. May the Lord sanctify thee for evermore in the enjoyment both
of bodily and spiritual health, and may I see thee in Christ obtaining
the crown!
