### <span id="viii.vi.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.—Opinions of Plato and Aristotle.

<span id="viii.vi.v-p1"></span><span id="viii.vi.v-p1.1"></span><span
id="viii.vi.v-p1.2"></span><span id="viii.vi.v-p1.3"></span><span
id="viii.vi.v-p1.4"></span>But possibly those who are unwilling to give
up the ancient and inveterate error, maintain that they have received
the doctrine of their religion not from those who have now been
mentioned, but from those who are esteemed among them as the most
renowned and finished philosophers, Plato and Aristotle. For these, they
say, have learned the perfect and true religion. But I would be glad to
ask, first of all, from those who say so, from whom they say that these
men have learned this knowledge; for it is impossible that men who have
not learned these so great and divine matters from some who knew them,
should either themselves know them, or be able correctly to teach
others; and, in the second place, I think we ought to examine the
opinions even of these sages. For we shall see whether each of these
does not manifestly contradict the other. But if we find that even they
do not agree with each other, I think it is easy to see clearly that
they too are ignorant. For Plato, with the air of one that has descended
from above, and has accurately ascertained and seen all that is in
heaven, says that the most high God exists in a fiery substance. <span
id="fr_2521"></span>[2522](#fn_2521.md) But Aristotle, in a book addressed
to Alexander of Macedon, giving a compendious explanation of his own
philosophy, clearly and manifestly overthrows the opinion of Plato,
saying that God does not exist in a fiery substance: but inventing, as a
fifth substance, some kind of ætherial and unchangeable body, says that
God exists in it. Thus, at least, he wrote: “Not, as some of those who
have erred regarding the Deity say, that God exists in a fiery
substance.” Then, as if he were not satisfied with this blasphemy
against Plato, he further, for the sake of proving what he says about
the ætherial body, cites as a witness him whom Plato had banished from
his republic as a liar, and as being an imitator of the images of truth
at three removes, <span id="fr_2522"></span>[2523](#fn_2522.md) for so
Plato calls Homer; for he wrote: “Thus at least did Homer speak, <span
id="fr_2523"></span>[2524](#fn_2523.md) ‘And Zeus obtained the wide heaven
in the air and the clouds,’ ” wishing to make his own opinion appear
more worthy of credit by the testimony of Homer; not being aware that if
he used Homer as a witness to prove that he spoke truth, many of his
tenets would be proved untrue. For Thales of Miletus, who was the
founder of philosophy among them, taking occasion from him, <span
id="fr_2524"></span>[2525](#fn_2524.md) will contradict his first opinions
about first principles. For Aristotle himself, having said that God and
matter are the first principles of all things, Thales, the eldest of all
their sages, says that water is the first principle of the things that
exist; for he says that all things are from water, and that all things
are resolved into water. And he conjectures this, first, from the fact
that the seed of all living creatures, which is their first principle,
is moist; and secondly, because all plants grow and bear fruit in
moisture, but when deprived of moisture, wither. Then, as if not
satisfied with his conjectures, he cites Homer as a most trustworthy
testimony, who speaks thus:—

> <span id="viii.vi.v-p5.1"></span>“Ocean, who is the origin of
> all.” <span id="fr_2525"></span>[2526](#fn_2525.md)  

<span id="viii.vi.v-p7"></span>May not Thales, then, very fairly say to
him, “What is the reason, Aristotle, why you give heed to Homer, as if
he spoke truth, when you wish to demolish the opinions of Plato; but
when you promulgate an opinion contrary to ours, you think Homer
untruthful?”

<span id="viii.vi.v-p3"></span> See the *Republic*, x. 2. By the
Platonic doctrine, the ideas of things in the mind of God were the
realities; the things themselves, as seen by us, were the images of
these realities; and poetry, therefore, describing the images of
realities, was only at the third remove from nature. As Plato puts it
briefly in this same passage, “the painter, the bed-maker, God—these
three are the masters of three species of beds.”
