Exposure of these absurdities.</h3>  
<p><a name="ix.ii.xvi-p1"></A>1. <a name="ix.ii.xvi-p1.1"></A><a name="ix.ii.xvi-p1.2"></A><a name="ix.ii.xvi-p1.3"></A><a name="ix.ii.xvi-p1.4"></A><a name="ix.ii.xvi-p1.5"></A>The all-wise Sige then announced the production of the four-and-twenty elements to him as follows:&#8212;Along with Monotes there coexisted Henotes, from which sprang two productions, as we have remarked above, Monas and Hen, which, added to the other two, make four, for twice two are four. And again, two and four, when added together, exhibit the number six. And further, these six being quadrupled, give rise to the twenty-four forms. And the names of the first Tetrad, which are understood to be most holy, and not capable of being expressed in words, are known by the Son alone, while the father also knows what they are. The other names which are to be uttered with respect, and faith, and reverence, are, according to him, Arrhetos and Sige, Pater and Aletheia. Now the entire number of this Tetrad amounts to four-and-twenty letters; for the name Arrhetos contains in itself seven letters, Seige&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2853"></A><A HREF="#fn_2853"><FONT SIZE="1">2854</FONT></A>
 five, Pater five, and Aletheia seven. If all these be added together&#8212;twice five, and twice seven&#8212;they complete the number twenty-four. In like manner, also, the second Tetrad, Logos and Zoe, Anthropos and Ecclesia, reveal the same number of elements. Moreover, that name of the Saviour which may be pronounced, viz., Jesus [<span class="Greek"><a name="ix.ii.xvi-p2.1"></A>&#8125;&#921;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span>], consists of six letters, but His unutterable name comprises four-and-twenty letters. The name <i>Christ the Son</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2854"></A><A HREF="#fn_2854"><FONT SIZE="1">2855</FONT></A>
 (<span class="Greek"><a name="ix.ii.xvi-p3.1"></A>&#965;&#7985;&#8056;&#962; &#935;&#961;&#949;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#8057;&#962;</span>) comprises twelve letters, but that which is unpronounceable in Christ contains thirty letters. And for this reason he declares that He is <i>Alpha</i> and <i>Omega</i>, that he may indicate the dove, inasmuch as that bird has this number [in its name].</p>  
<p><a name="ix.ii.xvi-p4"></A>2. <a name="ix.ii.xvi-p4.1"></A><a name="ix.ii.xvi-p4.2"></A>But Jesus, he affirms, has the following unspeakable origin. From the mother of all things, that is, the first Tetrad, there came forth the second Tetrad, after the manner of a daughter; and thus an Ogdoad was formed, from which, again, a Decad proceeded: thus was produced a Decad and an Ogdoad. The Decad, then, being joined with the Ogdoad, and multiplying it ten times, gave rise to the number <i>eighty</i>; and, again, multiplying eighty ten times, produced the number <i>eight hundred</i>. Thus, then, the whole number of the letters proceeding from the Ogdoad [multiplied] into the Decad, is eight hundred and eighty-eight.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2855"></A><A HREF="#fn_2855"><FONT SIZE="1">2856</FONT></A>
 This is the name of Jesus; for this name, if you reckon up the numerical value of the letters, amounts to eight hundred and eighty-eight. Thus, then, you have a clear statement of their opinion as to the origin of the supercelestial Jesus. Wherefore, also, the alphabet of the Greeks contains eight Monads, eight Decads, and eight Hecatads&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2856"></A><A HREF="#fn_2856"><FONT SIZE="1">2857</FONT></A>
, which present the number eight hundred and eighty-eight, that is, <i>Jesus</i>, who is formed of all numbers; and on this account He is called <i>Alpha</i> and <i>Omega</i>, indicating His origin from all. And, again, they put the matter thus: If the first Tetrad be added up according to the progression of number, the number ten appears. For one, and two, and three, and four, when added together, form ten; and this, as they will have it, is Jesus. Moreover, Chreistus, he says, being a word of eight letters, indicates the first Ogdoad, and this, when multiplied by ten, gives birth to Jesus (888). And Christ the Son, he says, is also spoken of, that is, the Duodecad. For the name Son, (<span class="Greek"><a name="ix.ii.xvi-p6.1"></A>&#965;&#7984;&#8057;&#962;</span>) contains four letters, and Christ (Chreistus) eight, which, being combined, point out the greatness of the Duodecad. But, he alleges, before the <i>Episemon</i> of this name appeared, that is Jesus the Son, mankind were involved in great ignorance and error. But when this name of six letters was manifested (the person bearing it clothing Himself in flesh, that He might come under the apprehension of man&#146;s senses, and having in Himself these six and twenty-four letters), then, becoming acquainted with Him, they ceased from their ignorance, and passed from death unto life, this name serving as their guide to the Father of truth.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2857"></A><A HREF="#fn_2857"><FONT SIZE="1">2858</FONT></A>
 For the Father of all had resolved to put an end to ignorance, and to destroy death. But this abolishing of ignorance was just the knowledge of Him. And therefore that man (Anthropos) was chosen according to His will, having been formed after the image of the [corresponding] power above.</p>  
<p><a name="ix.ii.xvi-p8"></A>3. As to the &AElig;ons, they proceeded from the Tetrad, and in that Tetrad were Anthropos and Ecclesia, Logos and Zoe. <a name="ix.ii.xvi-p8.1"></A>The powers, then, he declares, who emanated from these, generated that Jesus who appeared upon the earth. The angel Gabriel took the place of Logos, the Holy Spirit that of Zoe, the Power of the Highest that of Anthropos, while the Virgin pointed out the place of Ecclesia. And thus, by a special dispensation, there was generated by Him, through Mary, that man, whom, as He passed through the womb, the Father of all chose to [obtain] the knowledge of Himself by means of the Word. And on His coming to the water [of baptism], there descended on Him, in the form of a dove,  <A NAME="page_340"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 340</FONT></A> <a name="ix.ii.xvi-Page_340"></A>  that Being who had formerly ascended on high, and completed the twelfth number, in whom there existed the seed of those who were produced contemporaneously with Himself, and who descended and ascended along with Him. Moreover, he maintains that power which descended was the seed of the Father, which had in itself both the Father and the Son, as well as that power of Sige which is known by means of them, but cannot be expressed in language, and also all the &AElig;ons. And this was that Spirit who spoke by the mouth of Jesus, and who confessed that He was the son of Man as well as revealed the Father, and who, having descended into Jesus, was made one with Him. And he says that the Saviour formed by special dispensation did indeed destroy death, but that Christ made known the Father.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2858"></A><A HREF="#fn_2858"><FONT SIZE="1">2859</FONT></A>
 He maintains, therefore, that Jesus is the name of that man formed by a special dispensation, and that He was formed after the likeness and form of that [heavenly] Anthropos, who was about to descend upon Him. After He had received that &AElig;on, He possessed Anthropos himself, and Logos himself, and Pater, and Arrhetus, and Sige, and Aletheia, and Ecclesia, and Zoe.</p>  
<p><a name="ix.ii.xvi-p10"></A>4. Such ravings, we may now well say, go beyond <i>Iu, Iu, Pheu, Pheu,</i> and every kind of tragic exclamation or utterance of misery.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2859"></A><A HREF="#fn_2859"><FONT SIZE="1">2860</FONT></A>
 For who would not detest one who is the wretched contriver of such audacious falsehoods, when he perceives the truth turned by Marcus into a mere image, and that punctured all over with the letters of the alphabet? The Greeks confess that they first received sixteen letters from Cadmus, and that but recently, as compared with the beginning, [the vast antiquity of which is implied] in the common proverb: &#8220;Yesterday and before;&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2860"></A><A HREF="#fn_2860"><FONT SIZE="1">2861</FONT></A>
 and afterwards, in the course of time, they themselves invented at one period the aspirates, and at another the double letters, while, last of all, they say Palamedes added the long letters to the former. Was it so, then, that until these things took place among the Greeks, truth had no existence? For, according to thee, Marcus, the body of truth is posterior to Cadmus and those who preceded him&#8212; posterior also to those who added the rest of the letters&#8212; posterior even to thyself! For thou alone hast formed that which is called by thee the truth into an [outward, visible] image.</p>  
<p><a name="ix.ii.xvi-p13"></A>5. But who will tolerate thy nonsensical Sige, who names Him that cannot be named, and expounds the nature of Him that is unspeakable, and searches out Him that is unsearchable, and declares that He whom thou maintainest to be destitute of body and form, opened His mouth and sent forth the Word, as if He were included among organized beings; and that His Word, while like to His Author, and bearing the image of the invisible, nevertheless consisted of thirty elements and four syllables? It will follow, then, according to thy theory, that the Father of all, in accordance with the likeness of the Word, consists of thirty elements and four syllables! Or, again, who will tolerate thee in thy juggling with forms and numbers,&#8212;at one time thirty, at another twenty-four, and at another, again, only six,&#8212;whilst thou shuttest up [in these] the Word of God, the Founder, and Framer, and Maker of all things; and then, again, cutting Him up piecemeal into four syllables and thirty elements; and bringing down the Lord of all who founded the heavens to the number eight hundred and eighty-eight, so that He should be similar to the alphabet; and subdividing the Father, who cannot be contained, but contains all things, into a Tetrad, and an Ogdoad, and a Decad, and a Duodecad; and by such multiplications, setting forth the unspeakable and inconceivable nature of the Father, as thou thyself declarest it to be? And showing thyself a very D&aelig;dalus for evil invention, and the wicked architect of the supreme power, thou dost construct a nature and substance for Him whom thou callest incorporeal and immaterial, out of a multitude of letters, generated the one by the other. And that power whom thou affirmest to be indivisible, thou dost nevertheless divide into consonants, and vowels, and semi-vowels; and, falsely ascribing those letters which are mute to the Father of all things, and to His Enn&#339;a (thought), thou hast driven on all that place confidence in thee to the highest point of blasphemy, and to the grossest impiety.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2861"></A><A HREF="#fn_2861"><FONT SIZE="1">2862</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p><a name="ix.ii.xvi-p15"></A>6. With good reason, therefore, and very fittingly, in reference to thy rash attempt, has that divine elder&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2862"></A><A HREF="#fn_2862"><FONT SIZE="1">2863</FONT></A>
 and preacher of the truth burst forth in verse against thee as follows:&#8212;</p>  <blockquote><a name="ix.ii.xvi-p16.1"></A>&#8220;Marcus, thou former of idols, inspector of portents,<br>  Skill&#146;d in consulting the stars, and deep in the black arts of magic,<br>  Ever by tricks such as these confirming the doctrines of error,<br>  Furnishing signs unto those involved by thee in deception,<br>  Wonders of power that is utterly severed from God and apostate,<br>  Which Satan, thy true father, enables thee still to accomplish,<br>  By means of Azazel, that fallen and yet mighty angel,&#8212;<br>  Thus making thee the precursor of his own impious actions.&#8221;<br> </blockquote>  
<p><a name="ix.ii.xvi-p17"></A>Such are the words of the saintly elder. And I shall endeavour to state the remainder of their mystical system, which runs out to great length, in brief compass, and to bring to the light what  <A NAME="page_341"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 341</FONT></A> <a name="ix.ii.xvi-Page_341"></A>  has for a long time been concealed. For in this way such things will become easily susceptible of exposure by all.</p>
