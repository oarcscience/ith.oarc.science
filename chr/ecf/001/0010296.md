### <span id="v.xvii.viii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VIII.—Continuation: ignorance of Satan.

<span id="v.xvii.viii-p1"></span><span id="v.xvii.viii-p1.1"></span>For
many things are unknown <span id="fr_1332"></span>[1333](#fn_1332.md) to
thee; \[such as the following\]: the virginity of Mary; the wonderful
birth; Who it was that became incarnate; the star which guided those who
were in the east; the Magi who presented gifts; the salutation of the
archangel to the Virgin; the marvellous conception of her that was
betrothed; the announcement of the boy-forerunner respecting the son of
the Virgin, and his leaping in the womb on account of what was foreseen;
the songs of the angels over Him that was born; the glad tidings
announced to the shepherds; the fear of Herod lest his kingdom should be
taken from him; the command to slay the infants; the removal into Egypt,
and the return from that country to the same region; the infant
swaddling-bands; the human registration; the nourishing by means of
milk; the name of father given to Him who did not beget; the manger
because there was not room \[elsewhere\]; no human preparation \[for the
Child\]; the gradual growth, human speech, hunger, thirst, journeyings,
weariness; the offering of sacrifices and then also circumcision,
baptism; the voice of God over Him that was baptized, as to who He was
and whence \[He had come\]; the testimony of the Spirit and the Father
from above; the voice of John the prophet when it signified the passion
by the appellation of “the Lamb;” the performance of divers miracles,
manifold healings; the rebuke of the Lord ruling both the sea and the
winds; evil spirits expelled; thou thyself subjected to torture, and,
when afflicted by the power of Him who had been manifested, not having
it in thy power to do anything.

<span id="v.xvii.viii-p2"></span> According to many of the Fathers,
Satan was in great ignorance as to a multitude of points connected with
Christ. \[See my note at end of the Syriac Epistle to Ephesians,
*supra*.\]
