### <span id="viii.iv.cxxvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter CXXVII.—These passages of Scripture do not apply to the Father, but to the Word.

<span id="viii.iv.cxxvii-p1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.cxxvii-p1.1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.cxxvii-p1.2"></span>“These and other such sayings are
recorded by the lawgiver and by the prophets; and I suppose that I have
stated sufficiently, that wherever <span
id="fr_2447"></span>[2448](#fn_2447.md) God says, ‘God went up from
Abraham,’ <span id="fr_2448"></span>[2449](#fn_2448.md) or, ‘The Lord spake
to Moses,’ <span id="fr_2449"></span>[2450](#fn_2449.md) and ‘The Lord came
down to behold the tower which the sons of men had built,’ <span
id="fr_2450"></span>[2451](#fn_2450.md) or when ‘God shut Noah into the
ark,’ <span id="fr_2451"></span>[2452](#fn_2451.md) you must not imagine
that the unbegotten God Himself came down or went up from any place. For
the ineffable Father and Lord of all neither has come to any place, nor
walks, nor sleeps, nor rises up, but remains in His own place, wherever
that is, quick to behold and quick to hear, having neither eyes nor
ears, but being of indescribable might; and He sees all things, and
knows all things, and none of us escapes His observation; and He is not
moved or confined to a spot in the whole world, for He existed before
the world was made. How, then, could He talk with any one, or be seen by
any one, or appear on the smallest portion of the earth, when the people
at Sinai were not able to look even on the glory of Him who was sent
from Him; and Moses himself could not enter into the tabernacle which he
had erected, when it was filled with the glory of God; and the priest
could not endure to stand before the temple when Solomon conveyed the
ark into the house in Jerusalem which he had built for it? Therefore
neither Abraham, nor Isaac, nor Jacob, nor any other man, saw the Father
and ineffable Lord of all, and also of Christ, but \[saw\] Him who was
according to His will His Son, being God, and the Angel because He
ministered to His will; whom also it pleased Him to be born man by the
Virgin; who also was fire when He conversed with Moses from the bush.
Since, unless we thus comprehend the Scriptures, it must follow that the
Father and Lord of all had not been in heaven when what Moses wrote took
place: ‘And the Lord rained upon Sodom fire and brimstone from the Lord
out of heaven;’ <span id="fr_2452"></span>[2453](#fn_2452.md) and again,
when it is thus said by David: ‘Lift up your gates, ye rulers; and be ye
lift up, ye everlasting gates; and the King of glory shall enter;’ <span
id="fr_2453"></span>[2454](#fn_2453.md) and again, when He says: ‘The Lord
says to my Lord, Sit at My right hand, till I make Thine enemies Thy
footstool.’ <span id="fr_2454"></span>[2455](#fn_2454.md)
