But from my parents also I learned to be a Christian.&#8221; Rusticus the prefect said, &#8220;Where are your parents?&#8221; Euelpistus said, &#8220;In Cappadocia.&#8221; Rusticus says to Hierax, &#8220;Where are your parents?&#8221; And he answered, and said, &#8220;Christ is our true father, and faith in Him is our mother; and my earthly parents died; and I, when I was driven from Iconium in Phrygia, came here.&#8221; Rusticus the prefect said to Liberianus, &#8220;And what say you? Are you a Christian, and unwilling to worship [the gods]?&#8221; Liberianus said, &#8220;I too am a Christian, for I worship and reverence the only true God.&#8221;</p>
