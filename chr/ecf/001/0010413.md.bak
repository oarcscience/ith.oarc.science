### <span id="viii.ii.xl-p0.1"></span>Chapter XL.—Christ’s advent foretold.

<span id="viii.ii.xl-p1"></span><span id="viii.ii.xl-p1.1"></span><span
id="viii.ii.xl-p1.2"></span>And hear how it was foretold concerning
those who published His doctrine and proclaimed His appearance, the
above-mentioned prophet and king speaking thus by the Spirit of prophecy
“Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night showeth knowledge.
There is no speech nor language where their voice is not heard. Their
voice has gone out into all the earth, and their words to the ends of
the world. In the sun hath He set His tabernacle, and he as a bridegroom
going out of his chamber shall rejoice as a giant to run his
course.” <span id="fr_1850"></span>[1851](#fn_1850.md) And we have thought
it right and relevant to mention some other prophetic utterances of
David besides these; from which you may learn how the Spirit of prophecy
exhorts men to live, and how He foretold the conspiracy which was formed
against Christ by Herod the king of the Jews, and the Jews themselves,
and Pilate, who was your governor among them, with his soldiers; and how
He should be believed on by men of every race; and how God calls Him His
Son, and has declared that He will subdue all His enemies under Him; and
how the devils, as much as they can, strive to escape the power of God
the Father and Lord of all, and the power of Christ Himself; and how God
calls all to repentance before the day of judgment comes. These things
were uttered thus: “Blessed is the man who hath not walked in the
counsel of the ungodly, nor stood in the way of sinners, nor sat in the
seat of the scornful: but his delight is in the law of the Lord; and in
His law will he meditate day and night. And he shall be like a tree
planted by the rivers of waters, which shall give his fruit in his
season; and his leaf shall not wither, and whatsoever he doeth shall
prosper. The ungodly are not so, but are like the chaff which the wind
driveth away from the face of the earth. Therefore the ungodly shall not
stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the council of the righteous. For
the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous; but the way of the ungodly
shall perish. Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine new
things? The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take
counsel together, against the Lord, and against His Anointed, saying,
Let us break their bands asunder, and cast their yoke from us. He that
dwelleth in the heavens shall laugh at them, and the Lord shall have
them in derision. Then shall He speak to them in His wrath, and vex them
in His sore displeasure. Yet have I been set by Him a King on Zion His
holy hill, declaring the decree of the Lord. The Lord said to Me, Thou
art My Son; this day have I begotten Thee. Ask of Me, and I shall give
Thee the heathen for Thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the
earth as Thy possession. Thou shall herd them with a rod of iron; as the
vessels of a potter shalt Thou dash them in pieces. Be wise now,
therefore, O ye kings; be instructed, all ye judges of the earth. Serve
the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling. Embrace instruction,
lest at any time the Lord be angry, and ye perish from the right way,
when His wrath has been suddenly kindled. Blessed are all they that put
their trust in Him.” <span id="fr_1851"></span>[1852](#fn_1851.md)
