### <span id="viii.viii.vii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VII.—The body valuable in God’s sight.

<span id="viii.viii.vii-p1"></span>But the proof of the possibility of
the resurrection of the flesh I have sufficiently demonstrated, in
answer to men of the world. And if the resurrection of the flesh is not
found impossible on the principles even of unbelievers, how much more
will it be found in accordance with the mind of believers! But following
our order, we must now speak with respect to those who think meanly of
the flesh, and say that it is not worthy of the resurrection nor of the
heavenly economy, <span id="fr_2625"></span>[2626](#fn_2625.md) because,
first, its substance is earth; and besides, because it is full of all
wickedness, so that it forces the soul to sin along with it. But these
persons seem to be ignorant of the whole work of God, both of the
genesis and formation of man at the first, and why the things in the
world were made. <span id="fr_2626"></span>[2627](#fn_2626.md) For does not
the word say, “Let Us make man in our image, and after our
likeness?” <span id="fr_2627"></span>[2628](#fn_2627.md) What kind of man?
Manifestly He means fleshly man, For the word says, “And God took dust
of the earth, and made man.” <span id="fr_2628"></span>[2629](#fn_2628.md)
It is evident, therefore, that man made in the image of God was of
flesh. Is it not, then, absurd to say, that the flesh made by God in His
own image is contemptible, and worth nothing? But that the flesh is with
God a precious possession is manifest, first from its being formed by
Him, if at least the image is valuable to the former and artist; and
besides, its value can be gathered from the creation of the rest of the
world. For that on account of which the rest is made, is the most
precious of all to the maker.

<span id="viii.viii.vii-p3"></span> This might also be rendered, “and
the things in the world, on account of which he was made;” but the
subsequent argument shows the propriety of the above rendering.
