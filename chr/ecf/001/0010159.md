### <span id="v.iii.xiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIII.—Be established in faith and unity.

<span id="v.iii.xiii-p1"></span><span id="v.iii.xiii-p1.1"></span><span
id="v.iii.xiii-p1.2"></span>Study, therefore, to be established in the
doctrines of the Lord and the apostles, that so all things, whatsoever
ye do, may prosper both in the flesh and spirit; in faith and love; in
the Son, and in the Father, and in the Spirit; in the beginning and in
the end; with your most admirable bishop, and the well-compacted
spiritual crown of your presbytery, and the deacons who are according to
God. Be ye subject to the bishop, and to one another, as Jesus Christ to
the Father, <span id="page_65">p. 65</span> <span
id="v.iii.xiii-Page_65"></span> according to the flesh, and the apostles
to Christ, and to the Father, and to the Spirit; that so there may be a
union both fleshly and spiritual.

crown of your presbytery, and the deacons who are according to God. Be
ye subject to the bishop, and to one another, as Christ to the Father,
that there may be a unity according to God among you.
