### <span id="viii.vi.xiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIV.—A warning appeal to the Greeks.

<span id="viii.vi.xiv-p1"></span>It is therefore necessary, ye Greeks,
that you contemplate the things that are to be, and consider the
judgment which is predicted by all, not only by the godly, but also by
those who are irreligious, that ye do not without investigation commit
yourselves to the error of your fathers, nor suppose that if they
themselves have been in error, and have transmitted it to you, that this
which they have taught you is true; but looking to the danger of so
terrible a mistake, inquire and investigate carefully into those things
which are, as you say, spoken of even by your own teachers. For even
unwillingly they were on your account forced to say many things by the
Divine regard for mankind, especially those of them who were in Egypt,
and profited by the godliness of Moses and his ancestry. <span
id="viii.vi.xiv-p1.1"></span>For I think that some of you, when you read
even carelessly the history of Diodorus, and of those others who wrote
of these things, cannot fail to see that both Orpheus, and Homer, and
Solon, who wrote the laws of the Athenians, and Pythagoras, and Plato,
and some others, when they had been in Egypt, and had taken advantage of
the history of Moses, afterwards published doctrines concerning the gods
quite contrary to those which formerly they had erroneously promulgated.
