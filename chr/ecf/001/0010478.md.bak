### <span id="viii.iv.xvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVII.—The Jews sent persons through the whole earth to spread calumnies on Christians.

<span id="viii.iv.xvii-p1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.xvii-p1.1"></span><span id="viii.iv.xvii-p1.2"></span>“For
other nations have not inflicted on us and on Christ this wrong to such
an extent as you have, who in very deed are the authors of the wicked
prejudice against the Just One, and us who hold by Him. For after that
you had crucified Him, the only blameless and righteous Man,— through
whose stripes those who approach the Father by Him are healed, —when you
knew that He had risen from the dead and ascended to heaven, as the
prophets foretold He would, you not only did not repent of the
wickedness which you had committed, but at that time you selected and
sent out from Jerusalem chosen men through all the land to tell that the
godless heresy of the Christians had sprung up, and to publish those
things which all they who knew us not speak against us. So that you are
the cause not only of your own unrighteousness, but in fact of that of
all other men. And Isaiah cries justly: ‘By reason of you, My name is
blasphemed among the Gentiles.’ <span
id="fr_1985"></span>[1986](#fn_1985.md) And: ‘Woe unto their soul! because
they have devised an evil device against themselves, saying, Let us bind
the righteous, for he is distasteful to us. Therefore they shall eat the
fruit of their doings. Woe unto the wicked! evil shall be rendered to
him according to the works of his hands.’ And again, in other
words: <span id="fr_1986"></span>[1987](#fn_1986.md) ‘Woe unto them that
draw their iniquity as with a long cord, and their transgressions as
with the harness of a heifer’s yoke: who say, Let his speed come near;
and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel come, that we may know it.
Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put light for
darkness, and darkness for light; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet
for bitter!’ <span id="fr_1987"></span>[1988](#fn_1987.md) Accordingly, you
displayed great zeal in publishing throughout all the land bitter and
dark and unjust things against the only blameless and righteous Light
sent by God.

<span id="viii.iv.xvii-p5"></span>For He appeared distasteful to you
when He cried among you, ‘It is written, My house is the house of
prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves!’ <span
id="fr_1988"></span>[1989](#fn_1988.md) He overthrew also the tables of the
money-changers in the temple, and exclaimed, ‘Woe unto you, Scribes and
Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye pay tithe of mint and rue, but do not
observe the love of God and justice. Ye whited sepulchres! appearing
beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men’s bones.’ <span
id="fr_1989"></span>[1990](#fn_1989.md) And to the Scribes, ‘Woe unto you,
Scribes! for ye have the keys, and ye do not enter in yourselves, and
them that are entering in ye hinder; ye blind guides!’
