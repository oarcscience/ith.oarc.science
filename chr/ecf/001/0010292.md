### <span id="v.xvii.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.—The malignity and folly of Satan.

<span id="v.xvii.iv-p1"></span><span id="v.xvii.iv-p1.1"></span><span
id="v.xvii.iv-p1.2"></span>And indeed, before the cross was erected, he
(Satan) was eager that it should be so; and he “wrought” \[for this
end\] “in the children of disobedience.” <span
id="fr_1319"></span>[1320](#fn_1319.md) <span id="v.xvii.iv-p2.2"></span>He
wrought in Judas, in the Pharisees, in the Sadducees, in the old, in the
young, and in the priests. But when it was just about to be erected, he
was troubled, and infused repentance into the traitor, and pointed him
to a rope to hang himself with, and taught him \[to die by\]
strangulation. He terrified also the silly woman, disturbing her by
dreams; and he, who had tried every means to have the cross prepared,
now endeavoured to put a stop to its erection; <span
id="fr_1320"></span>[1321](#fn_1320.md) not that he was influenced by
repentance on account of the greatness of his crime (for in that case he
would not be utterly depraved), but because he perceived his own
destruction \[to be at hand\]. For the cross of Christ was the beginning
of his condemnation, the beginning of his death, the beginning of his
destruction. Wherefore, also, he works in some that they should deny the
cross, be ashamed of the passion, call the death an appearance, mutilate
and explain away the birth of the Virgin, and calumniate the \[human\]
nature <span id="fr_1321"></span>[1322](#fn_1321.md) itself as being
abominable. He fights along with the Jews to a denial of the cross, and
with the Gentiles to the calumniating of Mary, <span
id="fr_1322"></span>[1323](#fn_1322.md) who are heretical in holding that
Christ possessed a mere phantasmal body. <span
id="fr_1323"></span>[1324](#fn_1323.md) For the leader of all wickedness
assumes manifold <span id="fr_1324"></span>[1325](#fn_1324.md) forms,
beguiler of men as he is, inconsistent, and even contradicting himself,
projecting one course and then following another. For he is wise to do
evil, but as to what good may be he is totally ignorant. And indeed he
is full of ignorance, on account of his voluntary want of reason: for
how can he be deemed anything else who does not perceive reason when it
lies at his very feet?
