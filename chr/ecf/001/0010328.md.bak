### <span id="v.xxv.ii-p0.1"></span>Chapter II.—Ignatius is condemned by Trajan.

<span id="v.xxv.ii-p1"></span><span id="v.xxv.ii-p1.1"></span>For
Trajan, in the ninth <span id="fr_1402"></span>[1403](#fn_1402.md) year of
his reign, being lifted up \[with pride\], after the victory he had
gained over the Scythians and Dacians, and many other nations, and
thinking that the religious body of the Christians were yet wanting to
complete the subjugation of all things to himself, and \[thereupon\]
threatening them with persecution unless they should agree to <span
id="fr_1403"></span>[1404](#fn_1403.md) worship dæmons, as did all other
nations, thus compelled <span id="fr_1404"></span>[1405](#fn_1404.md) all
who were living godly lives either to sacrifice \[to idols\] or die.
<span id="v.xxv.ii-p4.1"></span>Wherefore the noble soldier of Christ
\[Ignatius\], being in fear for the Church of the Antiochians, was, in
accordance with his own desire, brought before Trajan, who was at that
time staying at Antioch, but was in haste \[to set forth\] against
Armenia and the Parthians. And when he was set before the emperor
Trajan, \[that prince\] said unto him, “Who art thou, wicked
wretch, <span id="fr_1405"></span>[1406](#fn_1405.md) who settest <span
id="fr_1406"></span>[1407](#fn_1406.md) thyself to transgress our commands,
and persuadest others to do the same, so that they should miserably
perish?” Ignatius replied, “No one ought to call Theophorus <span
id="fr_1407"></span>[1408](#fn_1407.md) wicked; for all evil spirits <span
id="fr_1408"></span>[1409](#fn_1408.md) have departed from the servants of
God. But if, because I am an enemy to these \[spirits\], you call me
wicked in respect to them, I quite agree with you; for inasmuch as I
have Christ the King of heaven \[within me\], I destroy all the devices
of these \[evil spirits\].” Trajan answered, “And who is Theophorus?”
Ignatius replied, “He who has Christ within his breast.” Trajan said,
“Do *we* not then seem to you to have the gods in our mind, whose
assistance we enjoy in fighting against our enemies?” Ignatius answered,
“Thou art in error when thou callest the dæmons of the nations gods.
<span id="v.xxv.ii-p8.1"></span>For there is but one God, who made
heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that are in them; and one Jesus
Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, whose kingdom may I enjoy.” Trajan
said, “Do you mean Him who was crucified under Pontius Pilate?” Ignatius
replied, “I mean Him who crucified my sin, with him who was the inventor
of it, <span id="fr_1409"></span>[1410](#fn_1409.md) and who has condemned
\[and cast down\] all the deceit and malice of the devil under the feet
of those who carry Him in their heart.” Trajan said, “Dost thou then
carry within thee Him that was crucified?” Ignatius replied, “Truly so;
for it is written, ‘I will dwell in them, and walk in <span
id="page_130">p. 130</span> <span id="v.xxv.ii-Page_130"></span> them.’
” <span id="fr_1410"></span>[1411](#fn_1410.md) Then Trajan pronounced
sentence as follows: “We command that Ignatius, who affirms that he
carries about within him Him that was crucified, be bound by soldiers,
and carried to the great \[city\] Rome, there to be devoured by the
beasts, for the gratification of the people.” When the holy martyr heard
this sentence, he cried out with joy, “I thank thee, O Lord, that Thou
hast vouchsafed to honour me with a perfect love towards Thee, and hast
made me to be bound with iron chains, like <span
id="fr_1411"></span>[1412](#fn_1411.md) Thy Apostle Paul.” Having spoken
thus, he then, with delight, clasped the chains about him; and when he
had first prayed for the Church, and commended it with tears to the
Lord, he was hurried away by the savage cruelty <span
id="fr_1412"></span>[1413](#fn_1412.md) of the soldiers, like a
distinguished ram <span id="fr_1413"></span>[1414](#fn_1413.md) the leader
of a goodly flock, that he might be carried to Rome, there to furnish
food to the bloodthirsty beasts.
