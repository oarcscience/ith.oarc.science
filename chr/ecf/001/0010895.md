### <span id="ix.viii.xx-p0.1"></span>XX.

<span id="ix.viii.xx-p1"></span>“And <span
id="fr_4828"></span>[4829](#fn_4828.md) he laid his hands upon him.” <span
id="fr_4829"></span>[4830](#fn_4829.md) The countenance of Joshua was also
glorified by the imposition of the hands of Moses, but not to the same
degree \[as that of Moses\]. Inasmuch, then, as he had obtained a
certain degree of grace, \[the Lord\] said, “And thou shall confer upon
him of thy glory.” <span id="fr_4830"></span>[4831](#fn_4830.md) For \[in
this case\] the thing given does not cease to belong to the giver.

<span id="ix.viii.xx-p2"></span> Massuet seems to more than doubt the
genuineness of this fragment and the next, and would ascribe them to the
pen of Apollinaris, bishop of Hierapolis in Phrygia, a contemporary of
Irenæus. Harvey passes over these two fragments.
