### <span id="v.v.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.—Pray rather that I may attain to martyrdom.

<span id="v.v.iii-p1"></span><span id="v.v.iii-p1.1"></span>Ye have
never envied any one; ye have taught others. Now I desire that those
things may be confirmed \[by your conduct\], which in your instructions
ye enjoin \[on others\]. Only request in my behalf both inward and
outward strength, that I may not only speak, but \[truly\] will; and
that I may not merely be called a Christian, but really be found to be
one. For if I be truly found \[a Christian\], I may also be called one,
and be then deemed faithful, when I shall no longer appear to the world.
Nothing visible is eternal. <span id="fr_837"></span>[838](#fn_837.md) “For
the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not
seen are eternal.” <span id="fr_838"></span>[839](#fn_838.md) For our God,
Jesus Christ, now that He is with <span
id="fr_839"></span>[840](#fn_839.md) the Father, is all the more revealed
\[in <span id="page_75">p. 75</span> <span id="v.v.iii-Page_75"></span>
His glory\]. Christianity is not a thing <span
id="fr_840"></span>[841](#fn_840.md) of silence only, but also of
\[manifest\] greatness.

<span id="v.v.iii-p6"></span><span id="v.v.iii-p6.1"></span>Ye have
never envied any one; ye have taught others. Now I desire that those
things may be confirmed \[by your conduct\], which in your instructions
ye enjoin \[on others\]. Only request in my behalf both inward and
outward strength, that I may not only speak, but \[truly\] will, so that
I may not merely be called a Christian, but really found to be one. For
if I be truly found \[a Christian\], I may also be called one, and be
then deemed faithful, when I shall no longer appear to the world.
Nothing visible is eternal. “For the things which are seen are temporal,
but the things which are not seen are eternal.” <span
id="fr_841"></span>[842](#fn_841.md) The Christian is not the result <span
id="fr_842"></span>[843](#fn_842.md) of persuasion, but of power. <span
id="fr_843"></span>[844](#fn_843.md) When he is hated by the world, he is
beloved of God. For says \[the Scripture\], “If ye were of this world,
the world would love its own; but now ye are not of the world, but I
have chosen you out of it: continue in fellowship with me.” <span
