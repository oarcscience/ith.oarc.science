### <span id="viii.vi.xviii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.—Testimony of Sophocles.

<span id="viii.vi.xviii-p1"></span><span
id="viii.vi.xviii-p1.1"></span>And if it is needful that we add
testimonies concerning one God, even from the dramatists, hear even
Sophocles speaking thus:—

> <span id="viii.vi.xviii-p1.2"></span>“There is one God, in truth there
> is but one,  
> Who made the heavens and the broad earth beneath,  
> The glancing waves of ocean and the winds  
> But many of us mortals err in heart,  
> And set up for a solace in our woes  
> Images of the gods in stone and wood,  
> Or figures carved in brass or ivory,  
> And, furnishing for these our handiworks,  
> Both sacrifice and rite magnificent,  
> We think that thus we do a pious work.”  

<span id="viii.vi.xviii-p2"></span>Thus, then, Sophocles.
