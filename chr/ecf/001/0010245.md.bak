### <span id="v.xii.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.

<span id="v.xii.iii-p1"></span>Ye have never envied any man. Ye have
taught others. Only pray ye for strength to be given to me from within
and from without, that I may not only speak, but also may be willing,
and that I may not merely be called a Christian, but also may be found
to be \[one\]; for if I am found to be \[so\], I may then also be called
\[so\]. Then \[indeed\] shall I be faithful, when I am no longer seen in
the world. For there is nothing visible that is good. The work is not
\[a matter <span id="fr_1161"></span>[1162](#fn_1161.md) \] of persuasion;
but Christianity is great when the world hateth it.

expressed in chap. xiv. of the Epistle in Ephesians.
