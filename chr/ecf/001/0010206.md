### <span id="v.vii.vii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VII.—Let us stand aloof from such heretics.

<span id="v.vii.vii-p1"></span><span id="v.vii.vii-p1.1"></span><span
id="v.vii.vii-p1.2"></span>They abstain from the Eucharist and from
prayer, <span id="fr_1015"></span>[1016](#fn_1015.md) because they confess
not the Eucharist to be the flesh of our Saviour Jesus Christ, which
suffered for our sins, and which the Father, of His goodness, raised up
again. Those, therefore, who speak against this gift of God, incur
death <span id="fr_1016"></span>[1017](#fn_1016.md) in the midst of their
disputes. But it were better for them to treat it with respect, <span
id="fr_1017"></span>[1018](#fn_1017.md) that they also might rise again. It
is fitting, therefore, that ye should keep aloof from such persons, and
not to speak of <span id="fr_1018"></span>[1019](#fn_1018.md) them either
in private or in public, but to give heed to the prophets, and above
all, to the Gospel, in which the passion \[of Christ\] has been revealed
to us, and the resurrection has been fully proved. <span
id="fr_1019"></span>[1020](#fn_1019.md) But avoid all divisions, as the
beginning of evils.

<span id="v.vii.vii-p7"></span><span id="v.vii.vii-p7.1"></span><span
id="v.vii.vii-p7.2"></span><span id="v.vii.vii-p7.3"></span>They are
ashamed of the cross; they mock at the passion; they make a jest of the
resurrection. <span id="v.vii.vii-p7.4"></span>They are the offspring of
that spirit who is the author of all evil, who led Adam, <span
id="fr_1020"></span>[1021](#fn_1020.md) by means of his wife, to transgress
the commandment, who slew Abel by the hands of Cain, who fought against
Job, who was the accuser of Joshua <span
id="fr_1021"></span>[1022](#fn_1021.md) the son of Josedech, who sought to
“sift the faith” <span id="fr_1022"></span>[1023](#fn_1022.md) of the
apostles, who stirred up the multitude of the Jews against the Lord, who
also now “worketh in the children of disobedience; <span
id="fr_1023"></span>[1024](#fn_1023.md) from whom the Lord Jesus Christ
will deliver us, who prayed that the faith of the apostles might not
fail, <span id="fr_1024"></span>[1025](#fn_1024.md) not because He was not
able of Himself to preserve it, but because He rejoiced in the
pre-eminence of the Father. It is fitting, therefore, that ye should
keep aloof from such persons, and neither in private nor in public to
talk with <span id="fr_1025"></span>[1026](#fn_1025.md) them; but to give
heed to the law, and the prophets, and to those who have preached to you
the word of salvation. But flee from all abominable heresies, and those
that cause schisms, as the beginning of evils.
