### <span id="ii.ii.lvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter LVI.—Let us admonish and correct one another.

<span id="ii.ii.lvi-p1"></span><span id="ii.ii.lvi-p1.1"></span><span
id="ii.ii.lvi-p1.2"></span><span id="ii.ii.lvi-p1.3"></span><span
id="ii.ii.lvi-p1.4"></span>Let us then also pray for those who have
fallen into any sin, that meekness and humility may be given to them, so
that they may submit, not unto us, but to the will of God. For in this
way they shall secure a fruitful and perfect remembrance from us, with
sympathy for them, both in our prayers to God, and our mention of them
to the saints. <span id="fr_246"></span>[247](#fn_246) Let us receive
correction, beloved, on account of which no one should feel displeased.
Those exhortations by which we admonish one another are both good \[in
themselves\] and highly profitable, for they tend to unite <span
id="fr_247"></span>[248](#fn_247) us to the will of God. For thus saith
the holy Word: “The Lord hath severely chastened me, yet hath not given
me over to death.” <span id="fr_248"></span>[249](#fn_248) “For whom the
Lord loveth He chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom He
receiveth.” <span id="fr_249"></span>[250](#fn_249) “The righteous,”
saith it, “shall chasten me in mercy, and reprove me; but let not the
oil of sinners make fat my head.” <span
id="fr_250"></span>[251](#fn_250) And again he saith, “Blessed is the
man whom the Lord reproveth, and reject not thou the warning of the
Almighty. <span id="ii.ii.lvi-p6.2"></span> <span
id="ii.ii.lvi-p6.3"></span>For He causes sorrow, and again restores \[to
gladness\]; He woundeth, and His hands make whole. He shall deliver thee
in six troubles, yea, in the seventh no evil shall touch thee. In famine
He shall rescue thee from death, and in war He shall free thee from the
power <span id="fr_251"></span>[252](#fn_251) of the sword. From the
scourge of the tongue will He hide thee, and thou shalt not fear when
evil cometh. Thou shalt laugh at the unrighteous and the wicked, and
shalt not be afraid of the beasts of the field. For the wild beasts
shall be at peace with thee: then shalt thou know that thy house shall
be in peace, and the habitation of thy tabernacle shall not fail. <span
id="fr_252"></span>[253](#fn_252) Thou shall know also that thy seed
shall be great, and thy children like the grass of the field. And thou
shall come to the grave like ripened corn which is reaped in its season,
or like a heap of the threshing-floor which is gathered together at the
proper time.” <span id="fr_253"></span>[254](#fn_253) Ye see, beloved,
that protection is afforded to those that are chastened of the Lord; for
since God is good, He corrects us, that we may be admonished by His holy
chastisement.
