### <span id="viii.viii.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.—Must the deformed rise deformed?

<span id="viii.viii.iv-p1"></span><span
id="viii.viii.iv-p1.1"></span>Well, they say, if then the flesh rise, it
must rise the same as it falls; so that if it die with one eye, it must
rise one-eyed; if lame, lame; if defective in any part of the body, in
this part the man must rise deficient. How truly blinded are they in the
eyes of their hearts! For they have not seen on the earth blind men
seeing again, and the lame walking by His word. All things which the
Saviour did, He did in the first place in order that what was spoken
concerning Him in the prophets might be fulfilled, “that the blind
should receive sight, and the deaf hear,” <span
id="fr_2617"></span>[2618](#fn_2617.md) and so on; but also to induce the
belief that in the resurrection the flesh shall rise entire. For if on
earth He healed the sicknesses of the flesh, and made the body whole,
much more will He do this in the resurrection, so that the flesh shall
rise perfect and entire. In this manner, then, shall those dreaded
difficulties of theirs be healed.
