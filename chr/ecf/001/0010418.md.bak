### <span id="viii.ii.xlv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XLV.—Christ’s session in heaven foretold.

<span id="viii.ii.xlv-p1"></span><span
id="viii.ii.xlv-p1.1"></span><span id="viii.ii.xlv-p1.2"></span><span
id="viii.ii.xlv-p1.3"></span>And that God the Father of all would bring
Christ to heaven after He had raised Him from the dead, and would keep
Him there <span id="fr_1859"></span>[1860](#fn_1859.md) until He has
subdued His enemies the devils, and until the number of those who are
foreknown by Him as good and virtuous is complete, on whose account He
has still delayed the consummation—hear what was said by the prophet
David. These are his words: “The Lord said unto My Lord, Sit Thou at My
right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool. The Lord shall
send to Thee the rod of power out of Jerusalem; and rule Thou in the
midst of Thine enemies. With Thee is the government in the day of Thy
power, in the beauties of Thy saints: from the womb of morning <span
id="fr_1860"></span>[1861](#fn_1860.md) have I begotten Thee.” <span
id="fr_1861"></span>[1862](#fn_1861.md) That which he says, “He shall send
to Thee the rod of power out of Jerusalem,” is predictive of the mighty,
word, which His apostles, going forth from Jerusalem, preached
everywhere; and though death is decreed against those who teach or at
all confess the name of Christ, we everywhere both embrace and teach it.
And if you also read these words in a hostile spirit, ye can do no more,
as I said before, than kill us; which indeed does no harm to us, but to
you and all who unjustly hate us, and do not repent, brings eternal
punishment by fire.

<span id="viii.ii.xlv-p2"></span> So, Thirlby, Otto, and Trollope seem
all to understand the word <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.ii.xlv-p2.1"></span>κατέχειν</span>; yet it seems worth
considering whether Justin has not borrowed both the sense and the word
from [2 Thess. 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#006.md),
