### <span id="viii.ii.lxx-p0.1"></span>Epistle of Antoninus to the common assembly of Asia. <span id="fr_1916"></span>[1917](#fn_1916)

<span id="viii.ii.lxx-p2"></span><span id="viii.ii.lxx-p2.1"></span>The
Emperor Cæsar Titus Ælius Adrianus Antoninus Augustus Pius, Supreme
Pontiff, in the fifteenth year of his tribuneship, Consul for the third
time, Father of the fatherland, to the Common Assembly of Asia,
greeting: I should have thought that the gods themselves would see to it
that such offenders should not escape. For if they had the power, they
themselves would much rather punish those who refuse to worship them;
but it is you who bring trouble on these persons, and accuse as the
opinion of atheists that which they hold, and lay to their charge
certain other things which we are unable to prove. But it would be
advantageous to them that they should be thought to die for that of
which they are accused, and they conquer you by being lavish of their
lives rather than yield that obedience which you require of them. And
regarding the earthquakes which have already happened and are now
occurring, it is not seemly that you remind us of them, losing heart
whenever they occur, and thus set your conduct in contrast with that of
these men; for they have much greater confidence towards God than you
yourselves have. And you, indeed, seem at such times to ignore the gods,
and you neglect the temples, and make <span id="page_187">p. 187</span>
<span id="viii.ii.lxx-Page_187"></span> no recognition of the worship of
God. And hence you are jealous of those who do serve Him, and persecute
them to the death. Concerning such persons, some others also of the
governors of provinces wrote to my most divine father; to whom he
replied that they should not at all disturb such persons, unless they
were found to be attempting anything against the Roman government. And
to myself many have sent intimations regarding such persons, to whom I
also replied in pursuance of my father’s judgment. But if any one has a
matter to bring against any person of this class, merely as such a
person, <span id="fr_1917"></span>[1918](#fn_1917) let the accused be
acquitted of the charge, even though he should be found to be such an
one; but let the accuser be amenable to justice.
