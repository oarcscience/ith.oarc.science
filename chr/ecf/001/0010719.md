### <span id="ix.ii.xxiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXII.—Deviations of heretics from the truth.

<span id="ix.ii.xxiii-p1"></span>1. <span
id="ix.ii.xxiii-p1.1"></span><span id="ix.ii.xxiii-p1.2"></span>The
rule <span id="fr_2928"></span>[2929](#fn_2928.md) of truth which we hold,
is, that there is one God Almighty, who made all things by His Word, and
fashioned and formed, out of that which had no existence, all things
which exist. Thus saith the Scripture, to that effect “By the Word of
the Lord were the heavens established, and all the might of them, by the
spirit of His mouth.” <span id="fr_2929"></span>[2930](#fn_2929.md) And
again, “All things were made by Him, and without Him was nothing
made.” <span id="fr_2930"></span>[2931](#fn_2930.md) There is no exception
or deduction stated; but the Father made all things by Him, whether
visible or invisible, objects of sense or of intelligence, temporal, on
account of a certain character given them, or eternal; and these
eternal <span id="fr_2931"></span>[2932](#fn_2931.md) things He did not
make by angels, or by any powers separated from His Ennœa. For God needs
none of all these things, but is He who, by His Word and Spirit, makes,
and disposes, and governs all things, and commands all things into
existence,—He who formed the world (for the world is of all),—He who
fashioned man,—He \[who\] <span id="fr_2932"></span>[2933](#fn_2932.md) is
the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, above
whom there is no other God, nor initial principle, nor power, nor
pleroma,—He is the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, as we shall prove.
Holding, therefore, this rule, we shall easily show, notwithstanding the
great variety and multitude of their opinions, that these men have
deviated from the truth; for almost all the different sects of heretics
admit that there is one God; but then, by their pernicious doctrines,
they change \[this truth into error\], even as the Gentiles do through
idolatry,—thus proving themselves ungrateful to Him that created them.
Moreover, they despise the workmanship of God, speaking against their
own salvation, becoming their own bitterest accusers, and being false
witnesses \[against themselves\]. Yet, reluctant as they may be, these
men shall one day rise again in the flesh, to confess the power of Him
who raises them from the dead; but they shall not be numbered among the
righteous on account of their unbelief.

<span id="ix.ii.xxiii-p7"></span>2. Since, therefore, it is a complex
and multiform task to detect and convict all the heretics, and since our
design is to reply to them all according to their special characters, we
have judged it necessary, first of all, to give an account of their
source and root, in order that, by getting a knowledge of their most
exalted Bythus, thou mayest understand the nature of the tree which has
produced such fruits.

<span id="ix.ii.xxiii-p2"></span> The Latin here begins with the words
“cum teneamus,” and the apodosis is found afterwards at “facile
arguimus.” But we have broken up the one long sentence into several.

<span id="ix.ii.xxiii-p5"></span> The text is here uncertain and
obscure: eternal things seem to be referred to, not as regarded
*substance*, but the *forms* assigned them.

<span id="fn_2932"></span>[347:2933](0010719.htm#fr_2932.md) <span

<span id="ix.ii.xxiii-p6"></span> This word would perhaps be better
cancelled.
