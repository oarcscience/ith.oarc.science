### <span id="viii.iv.lxxix-p0.1"></span>Chapter LXXIX.—He proves against Trypho that the wicked angels have revolted from God.

<span id="viii.iv.lxxix-p1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.lxxix-p1.1"></span><span id="viii.iv.lxxix-p1.2"></span>On
this, Trypho, who was somewhat angry, but respected the Scriptures, as
was manifest from his countenance, said to me, “The utterances of God
are holy, but your expositions are mere contrivances, as is plain from
what has been explained by you; nay, even blasphemies, for you assert
that angels sinned and revolted from God.”

<span id="viii.iv.lxxix-p2"></span>And I, wishing to get him to listen
to me, answered in milder tones, thus: “I admire, sir, this piety of
yours; and I pray that you may entertain the same disposition towards
Him to whom angels are recorded to minister, as Daniel says; for \[one\]
like the Son of man is led to the Ancient of days, and every kingdom is
given to Him for ever and ever. But that you may know, sir,” continued
I, “that it is not our audacity which has induced us to adopt this
exposition, which you reprehend, I shall give you evidence from Isaiah
himself; for he affirms that evil angels have dwelt and do dwell in
Tanis, in Egypt. These are \[his\] words: ‘Woe to the rebellious
children! Thus saith the Lord, You have taken counsel, but not through
Me; and \[made\] agreements, but not through My Spirit, to add sins to
sins; who have sinned <span id="fr_2249"></span>[2250](#fn_2249.md) in
going down to Egypt (but they have not inquired at Me), that they may be
assisted by Pharaoh, and be covered with the shadow of the Egyptians.
For the shadow of Pharaoh shall be a disgrace to you, and a reproach to
those who trust in the Egyptians; for the princes in Tanis <span
id="fr_2250"></span>[2251](#fn_2250.md) are evil angels. In vain will they
labour for a people which will not profit them by assistance, but \[will
be\] for a disgrace and a reproach \[to them\].’ <span
id="fr_2251"></span>[2252](#fn_2251.md) And, further, Zechariah tells, as
you yourself have related, that the devil stood on the right hand of
Joshua the priest, to resist him; and \[the Lord\] said, ‘The Lord, who
has taken <span id="fr_2252"></span>[2253](#fn_2252.md) Jerusalem, rebuke
thee.’ <span id="fr_2253"></span>[2254](#fn_2253.md) And again, it is
written in Job, <span id="fr_2254"></span>[2255](#fn_2254.md) as you said
yourself, how that the angels came to stand before the Lord, and the
devil came with them. And we have it recorded by Moses in the beginning
of Genesis, that the serpent beguiled Eve, and was cursed. And we know
that in Egypt there were magicians who emulated <span
id="fr_2255"></span>[2256](#fn_2255.md) the mighty power displayed by God
through the faithful servant Moses. And you are aware that David said,
‘The gods of the nations are demons.’ ” <span
id="fr_2256"></span>[2257](#fn_2256.md)
