### <span id="iv.iv.vii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VII.—Polycarp is found by his pursuers.

<span id="iv.iv.vii-p1"></span>His pursuers then, along with horsemen,
and taking the youth with them, went forth at supper-time on the day of
the preparation <span id="fr_430"></span>[431](#fn_430.md) with their usual
weapons, as if going out against a robber. <span
id="fr_431"></span>[432](#fn_431.md) And being come about evening \[to the
place where he was\], they found him lying down in the upper room
of <span id="fr_432"></span>[433](#fn_432.md) a certain little house, from
which he might have escaped into another place; but he refused, saying,
“The will of God <span id="fr_433"></span>[434](#fn_433.md) be done.” <span
id="fr_434"></span>[435](#fn_434.md) So when he heard that they were come,
he went down and spake with them. And as those that were present
marvelled at his age and constancy, some of them said. “Was so much
effort <span id="fr_435"></span>[436](#fn_435.md) made to capture such a
venerable man?” <span id="fr_436"></span>[437](#fn_436.md) Immediately
then, in that very hour, he ordered that something to eat and drink
should be set before them, as much indeed as they cared for, while he
besought them to allow him an hour to pray without disturbance. And on
their giving him leave, he stood and prayed, being full of the grace of
God, so that he could not cease <span id="fr_437"></span>[438](#fn_437.md)
for two full hours, to the astonishment of them that heard him, insomuch
that many began to repent that they had come forth against so godly and
venerable an old man.
