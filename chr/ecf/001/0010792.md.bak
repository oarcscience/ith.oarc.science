<span id="ix.iv.xxvi"></span>

### <span id="ix.iv.xxvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXV.—This world is ruled by the providence of one God, who is both endowed with infinite justice to punish the wicked, and with infinite goodness to bless the pious, and impart to them salvation.

<span id="ix.iv.xxvi-p1"></span>1. <span
id="ix.iv.xxvi-p1.1"></span><span id="ix.iv.xxvi-p1.2"></span><span
id="ix.iv.xxvi-p1.3"></span>God does, however, exercise a providence
over all things, and therefore He also gives counsel; and when giving
counsel, He is present with those who attend to moral discipline. <span
id="fr_3786"></span>[3787](#fn_3786.md) It follows then of course, that the
things which are watched over and governed should be acquainted with
their ruler; which things are not irrational or vain, but they have
understanding derived from the providence of God. And, for this reason
certain of the Gentiles, who were less addicted to \[sensual\]
allurements and voluptuousness, and were not led away to such a degree
of superstition with regard to idols, being moved, though but slightly,
by His providence, were nevertheless convinced that they should call the
Maker of this universe the Father, who exercises a providence over all
things, and arranges the affairs of our world.

<span id="ix.iv.xxvi-p3"></span>2. <span
id="ix.iv.xxvi-p3.1"></span>Again, that they might remove the rebuking
and judicial power from the Father, reckoning that as unworthy of God,
and thinking that they had found out a God both without anger and
\[merely\] good, they have alleged that one \[God\] judges, but that
another saves, unconsciously taking away the intelligence and justice of
both deities. For if the judicial one is not also good, to bestow
favours upon the deserving, and to direct reproofs against those
requiring them, he will appear neither a just nor a wise judge. On the
other hand, the good God, if he is merely good, and not one who tests
those upon whom he shall send his goodness, will be out of the range of
justice and goodness; and his goodness will seem imperfect, as not
saving all; \[for it should do so,\] if it be not accompanied with
judgment.

<span id="ix.iv.xxvi-p4"></span>3. Marcion, therefore, himself, by
dividing God into two, maintaining one to be good and the other
judicial, does in fact, on both sides, put an end to deity. For he that
is the judicial one, if he be not good, is not God, because he from whom
goodness is absent is no God at all; and again, he who is good, if he
has no judicial power, suffers the same \[loss\] as the former, by being
deprived of his character of deity. And how can they call the Father of
all wise, if they do not assign to Him a judicial faculty? For if He is
wise, He is also one who tests \[others\]; but the judicial power
belongs to him who tests, and justice follows the judicial faculty, that
it may reach a just conclusion; justice calls forth judgment, and
judgment, when it is executed with justice, will pass on to wisdom.
Therefore the Father will excel in wisdom all human and angelic wisdom,
because He is Lord, and Judge, and the Just One, and Ruler over all. For
He is good, and merciful, and patient, and saves whom He ought: nor does
goodness desert Him in the exercise of justice, <span
id="fr_3787"></span>[3788](#fn_3787.md) nor is His wisdom lessened; for He
saves those whom He should save, and judges those worthy of judgment.
Neither does He show Himself unmercifully just; for His goodness, no
doubt, goes on before, and takes precedency.

<span id="ix.iv.xxvi-p6"></span>4. The God, therefore, who does
benevolently cause His sun to rise upon all, <span
id="fr_3788"></span>[3789](#fn_3788.md) and sends rain upon the just and
unjust, shall judge those who, enjoying His equally distributed
kindness, have led lives not corresponding to the dignity of His bounty;
but who have spent their days in wantonness and luxury, in opposition to
His benevolence, and have, moreover, even blasphemed Him who has
conferred so great benefits upon them.

<span id="ix.iv.xxvi-p8"></span>5. <span
id="ix.iv.xxvi-p8.1"></span>Plato is proved to be more religious than
these men, for he allowed that the same God was both just and good,
having power over all things, and Himself executing judgment, expressing
himself thus, “And God indeed, as He is also the ancient Word,
possessing the beginning, the end, and the mean of all existing things,
does everything rightly, moving round about them according to their
nature; but retributive justice always follows Him against those who
depart from the divine law.” <span id="fr_3789"></span>[3790](#fn_3789.md)
Then, again, he points out that the Maker and Framer of the universe is
good. “And to the good,” he says, “no envy ever springs up with regard
to anything;” <span id="fr_3790"></span>[3791](#fn_3790.md) thus
establishing the goodness of God, as the beginning and the cause of the
creation of the world, but not ignorance, nor an erring Æon, nor the
<span id="page_460">p. 460</span> <span id="ix.iv.xxvi-Page_460"></span>
consequence of a defect, nor the Mother weeping and lamenting, nor
another God or Father.

<span id="ix.iv.xxvi-p11"></span>6. Well may their Mother bewail them,
as capable of conceiving and inventing such things for they have
worthily uttered this falsehood against themselves, that their Mother is
beyond the Pleroma, that is beyond the knowledge of God, and that their
entire multitude became <span id="fr_3791"></span>[3792](#fn_3791.md) a
shapeless and crude abortion: for it apprehends nothing of the truth; it
falls into void and darkness: for their wisdom (*Sophia*) was void, and
wrapped up in darkness; and Horos did not permit her to enter the
Pleroma: for the Spirit (Achamoth) did not receive them into the place
of refreshment. For their father, by begetting ignorance, wrought in
them the sufferings of death. We do not misrepresent \[their opinions
on\] these points; but they do themselves confirm, they do themselves
teach, they do glory in them, they imagine a lofty \[mystery\] about
their Mother, whom they represent as having been begotten without a
father, that is, without God, a female from a female, <span
id="fr_3792"></span>[3793](#fn_3792.md) that is, corruption from error.

<span id="ix.iv.xxvi-p14"></span>7. We do indeed pray that these men may
not remain in the pit which they themselves have dug, but separate
themselves from a Mother of this nature, and depart from Bythus, and
stand away from the void, and relinquish the shadow; and that they,
being converted to the Church of God, may be lawfully begotten, and that
Christ may be formed in them, and that they may know the Framer and
Maker of this universe, the only true God and Lord of all. We pray for
these things on their behalf, loving them better than they seem to love
themselves. For our love, inasmuch as it is true, is salutary to them,
if they will but receive it. It may be compared to a severe remedy,
extirpating the proud and sloughing flesh of a wound; for it puts an end
to their pride and haughtiness. Wherefore it shall not weary us, to
endeavour with all our might to stretch out the hand unto them. Over and
above what has been already stated, I have deferred to the following
book, to adduce the words of the Lord; if, by convincing some among
them, through means of the very instruction of Christ, I may succeed in
persuading them to abandon such error, and to cease from blaspheming
their Creator, who is both God alone, and the Father of our Lord Jesus
Christ. Amen.

<span id="ix.iv.xxvi-p12"></span> The Latin is “collectio eorum;” but
what *collectio* here means, it is not easy to determine. Grabe, with
much probability, deems it the representative of <span

prefers <span class="Greek"><span

perceive the relevancy of his references to the rhetorical syllogism.
