### <span id="v.ii.xvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVII.—Beware of false doctrines.

<span id="v.ii.xvii-p1"></span><span id="v.ii.xvii-p1.1"></span><span
id="v.ii.xvii-p1.2"></span>For this end did the Lord suffer the ointment
to be poured upon His head, <span id="fr_601"></span>[602](#fn_601.md) that
He might breathe immortality into His Church. Be not ye anointed with
the bad odour of the doctrine of the prince of this world; let him not
lead you away captive from the life which is set before you. And why are
we not all prudent, since we have received the knowledge of God, which
is Jesus Christ? Why do we foolishly perish, not recognising the gift
which the Lord has of a truth sent to us?

<span id="v.ii.xvii-p3"></span><span id="v.ii.xvii-p3.1"></span><span
id="v.ii.xvii-p3.2"></span>For this end did the Lord suffer the ointment
to be poured upon His head, <span id="fr_602"></span>[603](#fn_602.md) that
His Church might breathe forth immortality. For saith \[the Scripture\],
“Thy name is as ointment poured forth; therefore have the virgins loved
Thee; they have drawn Thee; at the odour of Thine ointments we will run
after Thee.” <span id="fr_603"></span>[604](#fn_603.md) Let no one be
anointed with the bad odour of the doctrine of \[the prince of\] this
world; let not the holy Church of God be led captive by his subtlety, as
was the first woman. <span id="fr_604"></span>[605](#fn_604.md) Why do we
not, as gifted with reason, act wisely? When we had received from
Christ, and had grafted in us the faculty of judging concerning God, why
do we fall headlong into ignorance? and why, through a careless neglect
of acknowledging the gift which we have received, do we foolishly
perish?
