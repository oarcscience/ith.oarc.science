### <span id="v.xi.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VIII. <span id="fr_1152"></span>[1153](#fn_1152.md)

<span id="v.xi.iii-p2"></span>For, so long as there is not implanted in
you any one lust which is able to torment you, behold, ye live in God. I
rejoice in you, and offer supplication <span
id="fr_1153"></span>[1154](#fn_1153.md) on account of you, Ephesians, a
Church which is renowned in all ages. For those who are carnal are not
able to do spiritual things, nor those that are spiritual carnal things;
in like manner as neither can faith \[do\] those things which are
foreign to faith, nor want of faith \[do\] what belongs to faith. For
those things which ye have done in the flesh, even these are spiritual,
because ye have done everything in Jesus Christ.

<span id="v.xi.iii-p3"></span> Thus Cureton renders the words, referring
in confirmation to the Peshito version of [Phil. i.
4](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#004.md)<span id="v.xi.iii-p3.1"></span>, but
the meaning is doubtful.
