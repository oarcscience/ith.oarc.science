### <span id="ix.vi.xxiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXII.—Christ did not come for the sake of the men of one age only, but for all who, living righteously and piously, had believed upon Him; and for those, too, who shall believe.

<span id="ix.vi.xxiii-p1"></span>1. Now in the last days, when the
fulness of the time of liberty had arrived, the Word Himself did by
Himself “wash away the filth of the daughters of Zion,” <span
id="fr_4123"></span>[4124](#fn_4123) when He washed the disciples’ feet
with His own hands. <span id="fr_4124"></span>[4125](#fn_4124) For this
is the end of the human race inheriting God; that as in the beginning,
by means of our first \[parents\], we were all brought into bondage, by
being made subject to death; so at last, by means of the New Man, all
who from the beginning \[were His\] disciples, having been cleansed and
washed from things pertaining to death, should come to the life of God.
For He who washed the feet of the disciples sanctified the entire body,
and rendered it clean. For this reason, too, He administered food to
them in a recumbent posture, indicating that those who were lying in the
earth were they to whom He came to impart life. As Jeremiah declares,
“The holy Lord remembered His dead Israel, who slept in the land of
sepulture; and He descended to them to make known to them His <span
id="page_494">p. 494</span> <span id="ix.vi.xxiii-Page_494"></span>
salvation, that they might be saved.” <span
id="fr_4125"></span>[4126](#fn_4125) For this reason also were the eyes
of the disciples weighed down when Christ’s passion was approaching; and
when, in the first instance, the Lord found them sleeping, He let it
pass,—thus indicating the patience of God in regard to the state of
slumber in which men lay; but coming the second time, He aroused them,
and made them stand up, in token that His passion is the arousing of His
sleeping disciples, on whose account “He also descended into the lower
parts of the earth,” <span id="fr_4126"></span>[4127](#fn_4126) to
behold with His eyes the state of those who were resting from their
labours, <span id="fr_4127"></span>[4128](#fn_4127) in reference to whom
He did also declare to the disciples: “Many prophets and righteous men
have desired to see and hear what ye do see and hear.” <span
id="fr_4128"></span>[4129](#fn_4128)

<span id="ix.vi.xxiii-p8"></span>2. <span
id="ix.vi.xxiii-p8.1"></span>For it was not merely for those who
believed on Him in the time of Tiberius Cæsar that Christ came, nor did
the Father exercise His providence for the men only who are now alive,
but for all men altogether, who from the beginning, according to their
capacity, in their generation have both feared and loved God, and
practised justice and piety towards their neighbours, and have earnestly
desired to see Christ, and to hear His voice. Wherefore He shall, at His
second coming, first rouse from their sleep all persons of this
description, and shall raise them up, as well as the rest who shall be
judged, and give them a place in His kingdom. For it is truly “one God
who” directed the patriarchs towards His dispensations, and “has
justified the circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision through
faith.” <span id="fr_4129"></span>[4130](#fn_4129) For as in the first
we were prefigured, so, on the other hand, are they represented in us,
that is, in the Church, and receive the recompense for those things
which they accomplished.
