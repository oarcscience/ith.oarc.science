<span id="ix.iv.xxi"></span>

### <span id="ix.iv.xxi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XX.—God showed himself, by the fall of man, as patient, benign, merciful, mighty to save. Man is therefore most ungrateful, if, unmindful of his own lot, and of the benefits held out to him, he do not acknowledge divine grace.

<span id="ix.iv.xxi-p1"></span>1. <span id="ix.iv.xxi-p1.1"></span><span
id="ix.iv.xxi-p1.2"></span>Long-suffering therefore was God, when man
became a defaulter, as foreseeing that victory which should be granted
to him through the Word. For, when strength was made perfect in
weakness, <span id="fr_3682"></span>[3683](#fn_3682.md) it showed the
kindness and transcendent power of God. For as He patiently suffered
Jonah to be swallowed by the whale, not that he should be swallowed up
and perish altogether, but that, having been cast out again, he might be
the more subject to God, and might glorify Him the more who had
conferred upon him such an unhoped-for deliverance, and might bring the
Ninevites to a lasting repentance, so that they should be converted to
the Lord, who would deliver them from death, having been struck with awe
by that portent which had been wrought in Jonah’s case, as the Scripture
says of them, “And they returned each from his evil way, and the
unrighteousness which was in their hands, saying, Who knoweth if God
will repent, and turn away His anger from us, and we shall not
perish?” <span id="fr_3683"></span>[3684](#fn_3683.md) —so also, from the
beginning, did God permit man to be <span id="page_450">p. 450</span>
<span id="ix.iv.xxi-Page_450"></span> swallowed up by the great whale,
who was the author of transgression, not that he should perish
altogether when so engulphed; but, arranging and preparing the plan of
salvation, which was accomplished by the Word, through the sign of
Jonah, for those who held the same opinion as Jonah regarding the Lord,
and who confessed, and said, “I am a servant of the Lord, and I worship
the Lord God of heaven, who hath made the sea and the dry land.” <span
id="fr_3684"></span>[3685](#fn_3684.md) \[This was done\] that man,
receiving an unhoped-for salvation from God, might rise from the dead,
and glorify God, and repeat that word which was uttered in prophecy by
Jonah: “I cried by reason of mine affliction to the Lord my God, and He
heard me out of the belly of hell;” <span
id="fr_3685"></span>[3686](#fn_3685.md) and that he might always continue
glorifying God, and giving thanks without ceasing, for that salvation
which he has derived from Him, “that no flesh should glory in the Lord’s
presence;” <span id="fr_3686"></span>[3687](#fn_3686.md) and that man
should never adopt an opposite opinion with regard to God, supposing
that the incorruptibility which belongs to him is his own naturally, and
by thus not holding the truth, should boast with empty superciliousness,
as if he were naturally like to God. For he (Satan) thus rendered him
(man) more ungrateful towards his Creator, obscured the love which God
had towards man, and blinded his mind not to perceive what is worthy of
God, comparing himself with, and judging himself equal to, God.

<span id="ix.iv.xxi-p7"></span>2. <span id="ix.iv.xxi-p7.1"></span>This,
therefore, was the \[object of the\] long-suffering of God, that man,
passing through all things, and acquiring the knowledge of moral
discipline, then attaining to the resurrection from the dead, and
learning by experience what is the source of his deliverance, may always
live in a state of gratitude to the Lord, having obtained from Him the
gift of incorruptibility, that he might love Him the more; for “he to
whom more is forgiven, loveth more:” <span
id="fr_3687"></span>[3688](#fn_3687.md) and that he may know himself, how
mortal and weak he is; while he also understands respecting God, that He
is immortal and powerful to such a degree as to confer immortality upon
what is mortal, and eternity upon what is temporal; and may understand
also the other attributes of God displayed towards himself, by means of
which being instructed he may think of God in accordance with the divine
greatness. For the glory of man \[is\] God, but \[His\] works \[are the
glory\] of God; and the receptacle of all His wisdom and power \[is\]
man. Just as the physician is proved by his patients, so is God also
revealed through men. And therefore Paul declares, “For God hath
concluded all in unbelief, that He may have mercy upon all;” <span
id="fr_3688"></span>[3689](#fn_3688.md) not saying this in reference to
spiritual Æons, but to man, who had been disobedient to God, and being
cast off from immortality, then obtained mercy, receiving through the
Son of God that adoption which is \[accomplished\] by Himself. For he
who holds, without pride and boasting, the true glory (opinion)
regarding created things and the Creator, who is the Almighty God of
all, and who has granted existence to all; \[such an one,\] continuing
in His love <span id="fr_3689"></span>[3690](#fn_3689.md) and subjection,
and giving of thanks, shall also receive from Him the greater glory of
promotion, <span id="fr_3690"></span>[3691](#fn_3690.md) looking forward to
the time when he shall become like Him who died for him, for He, too,
“was made in the likeness of sinful flesh,” <span
id="fr_3691"></span>[3692](#fn_3691.md) to condemn sin, and to cast it, as
now a condemned thing, away beyond the flesh, but that He might call man
forth into His own likeness, assigning him as \[His own\] imitator to
God, and imposing on him His Father’s law, in order that he may see God,
and granting him power to receive the Father; \[being\] <span
id="fr_3692"></span>[3693](#fn_3692.md) the Word of God who dwelt in man,
and became the Son of man, that He might accustom man to receive God,
and God to dwell in man, according to the good pleasure of the Father.

<span id="ix.iv.xxi-p14"></span>3. On this account, therefore, the Lord
Himself, <span id="fr_3693"></span>[3694](#fn_3693.md) who is Emmanuel from
the Virgin, <span id="fr_3694"></span>[3695](#fn_3694.md) is the sign of
our salvation, since it was the Lord Himself who saved them, because
they could not be saved by their own instrumentality; and, therefore,
when Paul sets forth human infirmity, he says: “For I know that there
dwelleth in my flesh no good thing,” <span
id="fr_3695"></span>[3696](#fn_3695.md) showing that the “good thing” of
our salvation is not from us, but from God. And again: “Wretched man
that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death?” <span
id="fr_3696"></span>[3697](#fn_3696.md) Then he introduces the Deliverer,
\[saying,\] “The grace of Jesus Christ our Lord.” And Isaiah declares
this also, \[when he says:\] “Be ye strengthened, ye hands that hang
down, and ye feeble knees; be ye encouraged, ye feeble-minded; be
comforted, fear not: behold, our God has given judgment with
retribution, and shall recompense: He will come Himself, and will save
us.” <span id="fr_3697"></span>[3698](#fn_3697.md) Here we see, that not by
ourselves, but by the help of God, we must be saved.

<span id="ix.iv.xxi-p20"></span>4. <span
id="ix.iv.xxi-p20.1"></span>Again, that it should not be a mere man who
should save us, nor \[one\] without flesh—for the angels are without
flesh—\[the same <span id="page_451">p. 451</span> <span
id="ix.iv.xxi-Page_451"></span> prophet\] announced, saying: “Neither an
elder, <span id="fr_3698"></span>[3699](#fn_3698.md) nor angel, but the
Lord Himself will save them because He loves them, and will spare them:
He will Himself set them free.” <span
id="fr_3699"></span>[3700](#fn_3699.md) And that He should Himself become
very man, visible, when He should be the Word giving salvation, Isaiah
again says: “Behold, city of Zion: thine eyes shall see our
salvation.” <span id="fr_3700"></span>[3701](#fn_3700.md) And that it was
not a mere man who died for us, Isaiah says: “And the holy Lord
remembered His dead Israel, who had slept in the land of sepulture; and
He came down to preach His salvation to them, that He might save
them.” <span id="fr_3701"></span>[3702](#fn_3701) And Amos (Micah.md) the
prophet declares the same: “He will turn again, and will have compassion
upon us: He will destroy our iniquities, and will cast our sins into the
depths of the sea.” <span id="fr_3702"></span>[3703](#fn_3702.md) And
again, specifying the place of His advent, he says: “The Lord hath
spoken from Zion, and He has uttered His voice from Jerusalem.” <span
id="fr_3703"></span>[3704](#fn_3703.md) And that it is from that region
which is towards the south of the inheritance of Judah that the Son of
God shall come, who is God, and who was from Bethlehem, where the Lord
was born \[and\] will send out His praise through all the earth,
thus <span id="fr_3704"></span>[3705](#fn_3704.md) says the prophet
Habakkuk: “God shall come from the south, and the Holy One from Mount
Effrem. His power covered the heavens over, and the earth is full of His
praise. Before His face shall go forth the Word, and His feet shall
advance in the plains.” <span id="fr_3705"></span>[3706](#fn_3705.md) Thus
he indicates in clear terms that He is God, and that His advent was \[to
take place\] in Bethlehem, and from Mount Effrem which is towards the
south of the inheritance, and that \[He is\] man. For he says, “His feet
shall advance in the plains:” and this is an indication proper to
man. <span id="fr_3706"></span>[3707](#fn_3706.md)

<span id="ix.iv.xxi-p11"></span> “Provectus.” This word has not a little

<span id="ix.iv.xxi-p24"></span> Irenæus quotes this as from Isaiah on
the present occasion; but in book iv. 22, 1, we find him referring the
same passage to Jeremiah. It is somewhat remarkable that it is to be
found in neither prophet, although Justin Martyr, in his dialogue with
Trypho, \[chap. lxxii. and notes, Dial. with Trypho, in this volume,\]
brings it forward as an argument against him, and directly accuses the
Jews of having fraudulently removed it from the sacred text. It is,
however, to be found in no ancient version of Jewish Targum, which fact
may be regarded as a decisive proof of its spuriousness.
