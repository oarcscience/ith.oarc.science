### <span id="viii.ii.xlvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XLVI.—The Word in the world before Christ.

<span id="viii.ii.xlvi-p1"></span>But lest some should, without reason,
and for the perversion of what we teach, maintain that we say that
Christ was born one hundred and fifty years ago under Cyrenius, and
subsequently, in the time of Pontius Pilate, taught what we say He
taught; and should cry out against us as though all men who were born
before Him were irresponsible —let us anticipate and solve the
difficulty. <span id="viii.ii.xlvi-p1.1"></span><span
id="viii.ii.xlvi-p1.2"></span>We have been taught that Christ is the
first-born of God, and we have declared above that He is the Word of
whom every race of men were partakers; and those who lived
reasonably <span id="fr_1862"></span>[1863](#fn_1862.md) are Christians,
even though they have been thought atheists; as, among the Greeks,
Socrates and Heraclitus, and men like them; and among the barbarians,
Abraham, and Ananias, and Azarias, and Misael, and Elias, and many
others whose actions and names we now decline to recount, because we
know it would be tedious. So that even they who lived before Christ, and
lived without reason, were wicked and hostile to Christ, and slew those
who lived reasonably. But who, through the power of the Word, according
to the will of God the Father and Lord of all, He was born of a virgin
as a man, and was named Jesus, and was crucified, and died, and rose
again, and ascended into heaven, an intelligent man will be able to
comprehend from what has been already so largely said. And we, since the
proof of this subject is less needful now, will pass for the present to
the proof of those things which are urgent.
