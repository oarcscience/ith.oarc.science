### <span id="v.xxv.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.—Ignatius writes to the churches.

<span id="v.xxv.iv-p1"></span><span id="v.xxv.iv-p1.1"></span>And these
things he thus spake, and thus testified, extending his love to Christ
so far as one who was about to <span
id="fr_1417"></span>[1418](#fn_1417) secure heaven through his good
confession, and the earnestness of those who joined their prayers to his
in regard to his \[approaching\] conflict; and to give a recompense to
the Churches, who came to meet him through their rulers, sending <span
id="fr_1418"></span>[1419](#fn_1418) letters of thanksgiving to them,
which dropped spiritual grace, along with prayer and exhortation.
Wherefore, seeing all men so kindly affected towards him, and fearing
lest the love of the brotherhood should hinder his zeal towards the
Lord, <span id="fr_1419"></span>[1420](#fn_1419) while a fair door of
suffering martyrdom was opened to him, he wrote to the Church of the
Romans the Epistle which is here subjoined.

<span id="v.xxv.iv-p5"></span>(See the Epistle as formerly given.)

<span id="fn_1417"></span>[130:1418](0010330.htm#fr_1417) <span
id="v.xxv.iv-p1.2"></span>

<span id="v.xxv.iv-p2"></span> The Latin version has, “that he was to.”
\[But compare the martyr’s Epistle to the Romans (cap. 5); “yet am I not
thereby justified,” —a double reference to St. Paul’s doctrine, [1 Cor.
iv. 4](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#004)<span id="v.xxv.iv-p2.1"></span>
and [1 Cor. xiii. 3](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#003)<span
id="v.xxv.iv-p2.2"></span>. See also his quotation (*Sept.*, [Prov.
xviii. 17](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#017)<span
id="v.xxv.iv-p2.3"></span>). Epistle to Magnesians, cap 12.\]

<span id="v.xxv.iv-p3"></span> The punctuation and construction are here
doubtful.

the Lord.”
