<span id="ix.iv.x"></span>

### <span id="ix.iv.x-p0.1"></span>Chapter IX.—One and the same God, the Creator of heaven and earth, is He whom the prophets foretold, and who was declared by the Gospel. Proof of this, at the outset, from St. Matthew’s Gospel.

<span id="ix.iv.x-p1"></span>1. <span id="ix.iv.x-p1.1"></span>This,
therefore, having been clearly demonstrated here (and it shall yet be so
still more clearly), that neither the prophets, nor the apostles, nor
the Lord Christ in His own person, did acknowledge any other Lord or
God, but the God and Lord supreme: the prophets and the apostles
confessing the Father and the Son; but naming no other as God, and
confessing no other as Lord: and the Lord Himself handing down to His
disciples, that He, the Father, is the only God and Lord, who alone is
God and ruler of all; —it is incumbent on us to follow, if we are their
disciples indeed, their testimonies to this effect. For Matthew the
apostle— knowing, as one and the same God, Him who had given promise to
Abraham, that He would make his seed as the stars of heaven, <span
id="fr_3372"></span>[3373](#fn_3372.md) and Him who, by His Son Christ
Jesus, has called us to the knowledge of Himself, from the worship of
stones, so that those who were not a people were made a people, and she
beloved who was not beloved <span id="fr_3373"></span>[3374](#fn_3373.md)
—declares that John, when preparing the way for Christ, said to those
who were boasting of their relationship \[to Abraham\] according to the
flesh, but who had their mind tinged and stuffed with all manner of
evil, preaching that repentance which should call them back from their
evil doings, said, “O generation of vipers, who hath shown you to flee
from the wrath to come? Bring forth therefore fruit meet for repentance.
And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham \[to our\]
father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up
children unto Abraham.” <span id="fr_3374"></span>[3375](#fn_3374.md) He
preached to them, therefore, the repentance from wickedness, but he did
not declare to them another God, besides Him who made the promise to
Abraham; he, the forerunner of Christ, of whom Matthew again says, and
Luke likewise, “For this is he that was spoken of from the Lord by the
prophet, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way
of the Lord, make straight the paths of our God. Every valley shall be
filled, and every mountain and hill brought low; and the crooked shall
be made straight, and the rough into smooth ways; and all flesh shall
see the salvation of God.” <span id="fr_3375"></span>[3376](#fn_3375.md)
There is therefore one and the same God, the Father of our Lord, who
also promised, through the prophets, that He would send His forerunner;
and His salvation—that is, His Word —He caused to be made visible to all
flesh, \[the Word\] Himself being made incarnate, that in all things
their King might become manifest. For it is necessary that those
\[beings\] which are judged do see the judge, and know Him from whom
they receive judgment; and it is also proper, that those which follow on
to glory should know Him who bestows upon them the gift of glory.

<span id="ix.iv.x-p6"></span>2. Then again Matthew, when speaking of the
angel, says, “The angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in sleep.” <span
id="fr_3376"></span>[3377](#fn_3376.md) Of what Lord he does himself
interpret: “That it may be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the
prophet, Out of Egypt have I called my son.” <span
id="fr_3377"></span>[3378](#fn_3377.md) “Behold, a virgin shall conceive,
and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel;
which is, being interpreted, God with us.” <span
id="fr_3378"></span>[3379](#fn_3378.md) David likewise speaks of Him who,
from the virgin, is Emmanuel: “Turn not away the face of Thine anointed.
The <span class="upper"><span id="ix.iv.x-p9.2"></span>Lord</span> hath
sworn a truth to David, and will not turn from him. Of the fruit of thy
body will I set upon thy seat.” <span
id="fr_3379"></span>[3380](#fn_3379.md) And again: “In Judea is God known;
His place has been made in peace, and His dwelling in Zion.” <span
id="fr_3380"></span>[3381](#fn_3380.md) Therefore there is one and the same
God, who was proclaimed by the prophets and announced by the Gospel; and
His Son, who was of the fruit of David’s body, that is, of the virgin of
\[the house of\] David, and Emmanuel; whose star also Balaam thus
prophesied: “There shall come a star out of Jacob, and a <span
id="page_423">p. 423</span> <span id="ix.iv.x-Page_423"></span> leader
shall rise in Israel.” <span id="fr_3381"></span>[3382](#fn_3381.md) But
Matthew says that the Magi, coming from the east, exclaimed “For we have
seen His star in the east, and are come to worship Him;” <span
id="fr_3382"></span>[3383](#fn_3382.md) and that, having been led by the
star into the house of Jacob to Emmanuel, they showed, by these gifts
which they offered, who it was that was worshipped; *myrrh*, because it
was He who should die and be buried for the mortal human race; *gold*,
because He was a King, “of whose kingdom is no end;” <span
id="fr_3383"></span>[3384](#fn_3383.md) and *frankincense*, because He was
God, who also “was made known in Judea,” <span
id="fr_3384"></span>[3385](#fn_3384.md) and was “declared to those who
sought Him not.” <span id="fr_3385"></span>[3386](#fn_3385.md)

<span id="ix.iv.x-p17"></span>3. <span id="ix.iv.x-p17.1"></span>And
then, \[speaking of His\] baptism, Matthew says, “The heavens were
opened, and He saw the Spirit of God, as a dove, coming upon Him: and lo
a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well
pleased.” <span id="fr_3386"></span>[3387](#fn_3386.md) For Christ did not
at that time descend upon Jesus, neither was Christ one and Jesus
another: but the Word of God—who is the Saviour of all, and the ruler of
heaven and earth, who is Jesus, as I have already pointed out, who did
also take upon Him flesh, and was anointed by the Spirit from the
Father—was made Jesus Christ, as Esaias also says, “There shall come
forth a rod from the root of Jesse, and a flower shall rise from his
root; and the Spirit of God shall rest upon Him: the spirit of wisdom
and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of
knowledge and piety, and the spirit of the fear of God, shall fill Him.
He shall not judge according to glory, <span
id="fr_3387"></span>[3388](#fn_3387.md) nor reprove after the manner of
speech; but He shall dispense judgment to the humble man, and reprove
the haughty ones of the earth.” <span
id="fr_3388"></span>[3389](#fn_3388.md) And again Esaias, pointing out
beforehand His unction, and the reason why he was anointed, does himself
say, “The Spirit of God is upon Me, because He hath anointed Me: He hath
sent Me to preach the Gospel to the lowly, to heal the broken up in
heart, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and sight to the blind; to
announce the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of vengeance; to
comfort all that mourn.” <span id="fr_3389"></span>[3390](#fn_3389.md) For
inasmuch as the Word of God was man from the root of Jesse, and son of
Abraham, in this respect did the Spirit of God rest upon Him, and anoint
Him to preach the Gospel to the lowly. But inasmuch as He was God, He
did not judge according to glory, nor reprove after the manner of
speech. For “He needed not that any should testify to Him of man, <span
id="fr_3390"></span>[3391](#fn_3390.md) for He Himself knew what was in
man.” <span id="fr_3391"></span>[3392](#fn_3391.md) For He called all men
that mourn; and granting forgiveness to those who had been led into
captivity by their sins, He loosed them from their chains, of whom
Solomon says, “Every one shall be holden with the cords of his own
sins.” <span id="fr_3392"></span>[3393](#fn_3392.md) Therefore did the
Spirit of God descend upon Him, \[the Spirit\] of Him who had promised
by the prophets that He would anoint Him, so that we, receiving from the
abundance of His unction, might be saved. Such, then, \[is the witness\]
of Matthew.
