<p><a name="viii.ii.lxiv-p1"></A><a name="viii.ii.lxiv-p1.1"></A>From what has been already said, you can  <A NAME="page_185"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 185</FONT></A> <a name="viii.ii.lxiv-Page_185"></A>  understand how the devils, in imitation of what was said by Moses, asserted that Proserpine was the daughter of Jupiter, and instigated the people to set up an image of her under the name of Kore [Cora, i.e., the maiden or daughter] at the spring-heads. For, as we wrote above,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1905"></A><A HREF="#fn_1905"><FONT SIZE="1">1906</FONT></A>
 Moses said, &#8220;In the beginning God made the heaven and the earth. And the earth was without form and unfurnished: and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.&#8221; In imitation, therefore, of what is here said of the Spirit of God moving on the waters, they said that Proserpine [or Cora] was the daughter of Jupiter.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1906"></A><A HREF="#fn_1906"><FONT SIZE="1">1907</FONT></A>
 And in like manner also they craftily feigned that Minerva was the daughter of Jupiter, not by sexual union, but, knowing that God conceived and made the world by the Word, they say that Minerva is the first conception [<span class="Greek"><a name="viii.ii.lxiv-p3.1"></A>&#7956;&#957;&#957;&#959;&#953;&#945;</span>]; which we consider to be very absurd, bringing forward the form of the conception in a female shape. And in like manner the actions of those others who are called sons of Jupiter sufficiently condemn them.</p>
