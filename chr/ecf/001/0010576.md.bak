### <span id="viii.iv.cxv-p0.1"></span>Chapter CXV.—Prediction about the Christians in Zechariah. The malignant way which the Jews have in disputations.

<span id="viii.iv.cxv-p1"></span>“But you ought to believe Zechariah
when he shows in parable the mystery of Christ, and announces it
obscurely. The following are his words: ‘Rejoice, and be glad, O
daughter of Zion: for, lo, I come, and I shall dwell in the midst of
thee, saith the Lord. And many nations shall be added to the Lord in
that day. And they shall be my people, and I will dwell in the midst of
thee; and they shall know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me unto thee.
And the Lord shall inherit Judah his portion in the holy land, and He
shall choose Jerusalem again. Let all flesh fear before the Lord, for He
is raised up out of His holy clouds. And He showed me Jesus (Joshua) the
high priest standing before the angel \[of the Lord <span
id="fr_2381"></span>[2382](#fn_2381.md) \]; and the devil stood at his
right hand to resist him. And the Lord said to the devil, The Lord who
hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee. Behold, is not this a brand plucked
out of the fire?’ ” <span id="fr_2382"></span>[2383](#fn_2382.md)

<span id="viii.iv.cxv-p4"></span><span
id="viii.iv.cxv-p4.1"></span><span id="viii.iv.cxv-p4.2"></span>As
Trypho was about to reply and contradict me, I said, “Wait and hear what
I say first: for I am not to give the explanation which you suppose, as
if there had been no priest of the name of Joshua (Jesus) in the land of
Babylon, where your nation were prisoners. But even if I did, I have
shown that if there <span id="fr_2383"></span>[2384](#fn_2383.md) was a
priest named Joshua (Jesus) in your nation, yet the prophet had not seen
him in his revelation, just as he had not seen either the devil or the
angel of the Lord by eyesight, and in his waking condition, but in a
trance, at the time when the revelation was made to him. <span
id="fr_2384"></span>[2385](#fn_2384.md) <span
id="viii.iv.cxv-p6.1"></span><span id="viii.iv.cxv-p6.2"></span><span
id="viii.iv.cxv-p6.3"></span><span id="viii.iv.cxv-p6.4"></span>But I
now say, that as \[Scripture\] said that the Son of Nave (Nun) by the
name Jesus (Joshua) wrought powerful works and exploits which proclaimed
beforehand what would be performed by our Lord; so I proceed now to show
<span id="page_257">p. 257</span> <span
id="viii.iv.cxv-Page_257"></span> that the revelation made among your
people in Babylon in the days of Jesus (Joshua) the priest, was an
announcement of the things to be accomplished by our Priest, who is God,
and Christ the Son of God the Father of all.

<span id="viii.iv.cxv-p7"></span>“Indeed, I wondered,” continued I, “why
a little ago you kept silence while I was speaking, and why you did not
interrupt me when I said that the son of Nave (Nun) was the only one of
contemporaries who came out of Egypt that entered the Holy Land along
with the men described as younger than that generation. For you swarm
and light on sores like flies. For though one should speak ten thousand
words well, if there happen to be one little word displeasing to you,
because not sufficiently intelligible or accurate, you make no account
of the many good words, but lay hold of the little word, and are very
zealous in setting it up as something impious and guilty; in order that,
when you are judged with the very same judgment by God, you may have a
much heavier account to render for your great audacities, whether evil
actions, or bad interpretations which you obtain by falsifying the
truth. For with what judgment you judge, it is righteous that you be
judged withal.
