### <span id="viii.iv.lxxv-p0.1"></span>Chapter LXXV.—It is proved that Jesus was the name of God in the book of Exodus.

<span id="viii.iv.lxxv-p1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.lxxv-p1.1"></span><span id="viii.iv.lxxv-p1.2"></span><span
id="viii.iv.lxxv-p1.3"></span>“Moreover, in the book of Exodus we have
also perceived that the name of God Himself which, He says, was not
revealed to Abraham or to Jacob, was Jesus, and was declared
mysteriously through Moses. Thus it is written: ‘And the Lord spake to
Moses, Say to this people, Behold, I send My angel before thy face, to
keep thee in the way, to bring thee into the land which I have prepared
for thee. Give heed to Him, and obey Him; do not disobey Him. For He
will not draw back from you; for My name is in Him.’ <span
id="fr_2229"></span>[2230](#fn_2229) Now understand that He who led your
fathers into the land is called by this name Jesus, and first called
Auses <span id="fr_2230"></span>[2231](#fn_2230) (Oshea). For if you
shall understand this, you shall likewise perceive that the name of Him
who said to Moses, ‘for My name is in Him,’ was Jesus. For, indeed, He
was also called Israel, and Jacob’s name was changed to this also. Now
Isaiah shows that those prophets who are sent to publish tidings from
God are called His angels and apostles. For Isaiah says in a certain
place, ‘Send me.’ <span id="fr_2231"></span>[2232](#fn_2231) And that
the prophet whose name was changed, Jesus \[Joshua\], was strong and
great, is manifest to all. If, then, we know that God revealed Himself
in so many forms to Abraham, and to Jacob, and to Moses, how are we at a
loss, and do not believe that, according to the will of the Father of
all things, it was possible for Him to be born man of the Virgin,
especially after we have such <span id="fr_2232"></span>[2233](#fn_2232)
Scriptures, from which it can be plainly perceived that He became so
according to the will of the Father?
