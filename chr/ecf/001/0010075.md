### <span id="iii.ii.viii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VIII.—The miserable state of men before the coming of the Word.

<span id="iii.ii.viii-p1"></span><span
id="iii.ii.viii-p1.1"></span><span id="iii.ii.viii-p1.2"></span>For, who
of men at all understood before His coming what God is? <span
id="iii.ii.viii-p1.3"></span>Do you accept of the vain and silly
doctrines of those who are deemed trustworthy philosophers? of whom some
said that fire was God, calling that God to which they themselves were
by and by to come; and some water; and others some other of the elements
formed by God. But if any one of these theories be worthy of
approbation, every one of the rest of created things might also be
declared to be God. But such declarations are simply the startling and
erroneous utterances of deceivers; <span
id="fr_301"></span>[302](#fn_301.md) and no man has either seen Him, or
made Him known, <span id="fr_302"></span>[303](#fn_302.md) but He has
revealed Himself. And He has manifested Himself through faith, to which
alone it is given to behold God. For God, the Lord and Fashioner of all
things, who made all things, and assigned them their several positions,
proved Himself not merely a friend of mankind, but also long-suffering
\[in His dealings with them\]. Yea, He was always of such a character,
and still is, and will ever be, kind and good, and free from wrath, and
true, and the only one who is \[absolutely\] good; <span
id="fr_303"></span>[304](#fn_303.md) and He formed in His mind a great and
unspeakable conception, which He communicated to His Son alone. As long,
then, as He held and preserved His own wise counsel in
concealment, <span id="fr_304"></span>[305](#fn_304.md) He appeared to
neglect us, and to have no care over us. But after He revealed and laid
open, through His beloved Son, the things which had been prepared from
the beginning, He conferred every blessing <span
id="fr_305"></span>[306](#fn_305.md) all at once upon us, so that we should
both share in His benefits, and see and be active <span
id="fr_306"></span>[307](#fn_306.md) \[in His service\]. Who of us would
ever have expected these things? He was aware, then, of all things in
His own mind, along with His Son, according to the relation <span
id="fr_307"></span>[308](#fn_307.md) subsisting between them.

id="iii.ii.viii-p1.4"></span>

<span id="iii.ii.viii-p2"></span> Literally, “these things are the
marvels and error.”

id="iii.ii.viii-p2.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ii.viii-p3"></span> Or, “known Him.”

id="iii.ii.viii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ii.viii-p7"></span> The sense is here very obscure. We
have followed the text of Otto, who fills up the *lacuna* in the <span
class="upper"><span id="iii.ii.viii-p7.1"></span>ms.</span> as above.
Others have, “to see, and to handle Him.”
