### <span id="viii.iv.cvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter CVII.—The same is taught from the history of Jonah.

<span id="viii.iv.cvii-p1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.cvii-p1.1"></span><span id="viii.iv.cvii-p1.2"></span>“And
that He would rise again on the third day after the crucifixion, it is
written <span id="fr_2358"></span>[2359](#fn_2358.md) in the memoirs that
some of your nation, questioning Him, said, ‘Show us a sign;’ and He
replied to them, ‘An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a
sign; and no sign shall be given them, save the sign of Jonah.’ And
since He spoke this obscurely, it was to be understood by the audience
that after His crucifixion He should rise again on the third day. And He
showed that your generation was more wicked and more adulterous than the
city of Nineveh; for the latter, when Jonah preached to them, after he
had been cast up on the third day from the belly of the great fish, that
after three (in other versions, forty) <span
id="fr_2359"></span>[2360](#fn_2359.md) days they should all perish,
proclaimed a fast of all creatures, men and beasts, with sackcloth, and
with earnest lamentation, with true repentance from the heart, and
turning away from unrighteousness, in the belief that God is merciful
and kind to all who turn from wickedness; so that the king of that city
himself, with his nobles also, put on sackcloth and remained fasting and
praying, and obtained their request that the city should not be
overthrown. But when Jonah was grieved that on the (fortieth) third day,
as he proclaimed, the city was not overthrown, by the dispensation of a
gourd <span id="fr_2360"></span>[2361](#fn_2360.md) springing up from the
earth for him, under which he sat <span id="page_253">p. 253</span>
<span id="viii.iv.cvii-Page_253"></span> and was shaded from the heat
(now the gourd had sprung up suddenly, and Jonah had neither planted nor
watered it, but it had come up all at once to afford him shade), and by
the other dispensation of its withering away, for which Jonah grieved,
\[God\] convicted him of being unjustly displeased because the city of
Nineveh had not been overthrown, and said, ‘Thou hast had pity on the
gourd, for the which thou hast not laboured, neither madest it grow;
which came up in a night, and perished in a night. And shall I not spare
Nineveh, the great city, wherein dwell more than six score thousand
persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left
hand; and also much cattle?’ <span id="fr_2361"></span>[2362](#fn_2361.md)

<span id="viii.iv.cvii-p3"></span> In the LXX. only *three* days are
recorded, though in the Hebrew and other versions *forty*. The
parenthetic clause is probably the work of a transcriber.
