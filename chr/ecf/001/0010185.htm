<p><a name="v.v.ix-p1"></A>Remember in your prayers the Church in Syria, which now has God for its shepherd, instead of me. Jesus Christ alone will oversee it, and your love [will also regard it]. But as for me, I am ashamed to be counted one of them; for indeed I am not worthy, as being the very last of them, and one born out of due time.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_873"></A><A HREF="#fn_873"><FONT SIZE="1">874</FONT></A>
 But I have obtained mercy to be somebody, if I shall attain to God. <a name="v.v.ix-p2.2"></A>My spirit salutes you, and the love of the Churches that have received me in the name of Jesus Christ, and not as a mere passer-by. For even those Churches which were not&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_874"></A><A HREF="#fn_874"><FONT SIZE="1">875</FONT></A>

 city by city, [to meet me.]</p>  
<p><a name="v.v.ix-p6"></A>Remember in your prayers the Church which is in Syria, which, instead of me, has now for its shepherd the Lord, who says, &#8220;I am the good Shepherd.&#8221; And He alone will oversee it, as well as your love towards Him. But as for me, I am ashamed to be counted one of them; for I am not worthy, as being the very last of them, and one born out of due time. But I have obtained mercy to be somebody, if I shall attain to God. <a name="v.v.ix-p6.1"></A>My spirit salutes you, and the love of the Churches which have received me in the name of Jesus Christ, and not as a mere passer-by. For even those Churches which were not near to me in the way, have brought me forward, city by city.</p>
