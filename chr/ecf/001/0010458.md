### <span id="viii.iii.xiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIII.—How the Word has been in all men.

<span id="viii.iii.xiii-p1"></span><span
id="viii.iii.xiii-p1.1"></span>For I myself, when I discovered tile
wicked disguise which the evil spirits had thrown around the divine
doctrines of the Christians, to turn aside others from joining them,
laughed both at those who framed these falsehoods, and at the disguise
itself and at popular opinion and I confess that I both boast and with
all my strength <span id="page_193">p. 193</span> <span
id="viii.iii.xiii-Page_193"></span> strive to be found a Christian; not
because the teachings of Plato are different from those of Christ, but
because they are not in all respects similar, as neither are those of
the others, Stoics, and poets, and historians. For each man spoke well
in proportion to the share he had of the spermatic word, <span
id="fr_1943"></span>[1944](#fn_1943.md) seeing what was related to it. But
they who contradict themselves on the more important points appear not
to have possessed the heavenly <span
id="fr_1944"></span>[1945](#fn_1944.md) wisdom, and the knowledge which
cannot be spoken against. Whatever things were rightly said among all
men, are the property of us Christians. <span
id="viii.iii.xiii-p3.1"></span><span id="viii.iii.xiii-p3.2"></span>For
next to God, we worship and love the Word who is from the unbegotten and
ineffable God, since also He became man for our sakes, that becoming a
partaker of our sufferings, He might also bring us healing. For all the
writers were able to see realities darkly through the sowing of the
implanted word that was in them. For the seed and imitation impacted
according to capacity is one thing, and quite another is the thing
itself, of which there is the participation and imitation according to
the grace which is from Him.
