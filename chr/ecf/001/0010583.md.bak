### <span id="viii.iv.cxxii-p0.1"></span>Chapter CXXII.—The Jews understand this of the proselytes without reason.

<span id="viii.iv.cxxii-p1"></span>“You think that these words refer to
the stranger <span id="fr_2416"></span>[2417](#fn_2416.md) and the
proselytes, but in fact they refer to us who have been illumined by
Jesus. For Christ would have borne witness even to them; but now you are
become twofold more the children of hell, as He said Himself. <span
id="fr_2417"></span>[2418](#fn_2417.md) Therefore what was written by the
prophets was spoken not of those persons, but of us, concerning whom the
Scripture speaks: ‘I will lead the blind by a way which they knew not;
and they shall walk in paths which they have not known. And I am
witness, saith the Lord God, and my servant whom I have chosen.’ <span
id="fr_2418"></span>[2419](#fn_2418.md) To whom, then, does Christ bear
witness? Manifestly to those who have believed. But the proselytes not
only do not believe, but twofold more than yourselves blaspheme His
name, and wish to torture and put to death us who believe in Him; for in
all points they strive to be like you. And again in other words He
cries: ‘I the Lord have called Thee in righteousness, and will hold
Thine hand, and will strengthen Thee, and will give Thee for a covenant
of the people, for a light of the Gentiles, to open the eyes of the
blind, to bring out the prisoners from their bonds.’ <span
id="fr_2419"></span>[2420](#fn_2419.md) These words, indeed, sirs, refer
also to Christ, and concern the enlightened nations; or will you say
again, He speaks to them of the law and the proselytes?”

<span id="viii.iv.cxxii-p6"></span>Then some of those who had come on
the second day cried out as if they had been in a theatre, “But what?
does He not refer to the law, and to those illumined by it? Now these
are proselytes.”

<span id="viii.iv.cxxii-p7"></span>“No,” I said, looking towards Trypho,
“since, if the law were able to enlighten the nations and those who
possess it, what need is there of a new covenant? But since God
announced beforehand that He would send a new covenant, and an
everlasting law and commandment, we will not understand this of the old
law and its proselytes, but of Christ and His proselytes, namely us
Gentiles, whom He has illumined, as He says somewhere: ‘Thus saith the
Lord, In an acceptable time have I heard Thee, and in a day of salvation
have I helped Thee, and I have given Thee for a covenant of the people,
to establish the earth, and to inherit the deserted.’ <span
id="fr_2420"></span>[2421](#fn_2420.md) What, then, is Christ’s
inheritance? Is it not the nations? What is the covenant of God? Is it
not <span id="page_261">p. 261</span> <span
id="viii.iv.cxxii-Page_261"></span> Christ? As He says in another place:
‘Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten Thee. Ask of Me, and I shall
give Thee the nations for Thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of
the earth for Thy possession.’ <span
id="fr_2421"></span>[2422](#fn_2421.md)
