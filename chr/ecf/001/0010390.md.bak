### <span id="viii.ii.xvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVII.—Christ taught civil obedience.

<span id="viii.ii.xvii-p1"></span><span
id="viii.ii.xvii-p1.1"></span><span id="viii.ii.xvii-p1.2"></span><span
id="viii.ii.xvii-p1.3"></span>And everywhere we, more readily than all
men, endeavour to pay to those appointed by you the taxes both ordinary
and extraordinary, <span id="fr_1799"></span>[1800](#fn_1799.md) as we have
been taught by Him; for at that time some came to Him and asked Him, if
one ought to pay tribute to Cæsar; and He answered, “Tell Me, whose
image does the coin bear?” And they said, “Cæsar’s.” And again He
answered them, “Render therefore to Cæsar the things that are Cæsar’s,
and to God the things that are God’s.” <span
id="fr_1800"></span>[1801](#fn_1800.md) Whence to God alone we render
worship, but in other things we gladly serve you, acknowledging you as
kings and rulers of men, and praying that with your kingly power you be
found to possess also sound judgment. <span
id="viii.ii.xvii-p3.2"></span>But if you pay no regard to our prayers
and frank explanations, we shall suffer no loss, since we believe (or
rather, indeed, are persuaded) that every man will suffer punishment in
eternal fire according to the merit of his deed, and will render account
according to the power he has received from God, as Christ intimated
when He said, “To whom God has given more, of him shall more be
required.” <span id="fr_1801"></span>[1802](#fn_1801.md)
