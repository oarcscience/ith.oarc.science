### <span id="viii.ii.lv-p0.1"></span>Chapter LV.—Symbols of the cross.

<span id="viii.ii.lv-p1"></span><span id="viii.ii.lv-p1.1"></span><span
id="viii.ii.lv-p1.2"></span>But in no instance, not even in any of those
called sons of Jupiter, did they imitate the being crucified; for it was
not understood by them, all the things said of it having been put
symbolically. And this, as the prophet foretold, is the greatest symbol
of His power and role; as is also proved by the things which fall under
our observation. For consider all the things in the world, whether
without this form they could be administered or have any community. For
the sea is not traversed except that trophy which is called a sail abide
safe in the ship; and the earth is not ploughed without it: diggers and
mechanics do not their work, except with tools which have this shape.
And the human form differs from that of the irrational animals in
nothing else than in its being erect and having the hands extended, and
having on the face extending from the forehead what is called the nose,
through which there is respiration for the living creature; and this
shows no other form than that of the cross. And so it was said by the
prophet, “The breath before our face is the Lord Christ.” <span
id="fr_1884"></span>[1885](#fn_1884.md) And the power of this form is shown
by your own symbols on what are called “vexilla” \[banners\] and <span
id="page_182">p. 182</span> <span id="viii.ii.lv-Page_182"></span>
trophies, with which all your state possessions are made, using these as
the insignia of your power and government, even though you do so
unwittingly. <span id="fr_1885"></span>[1886](#fn_1885.md) And with this
form you consecrate the images of your emperors when they die, and you
name them gods by inscriptions. Since, therefore, we have urged you both
by reason and by an evident form, and to the utmost of our ability, we
know that now we are blameless even though you disbelieve; for our part
is done and finished.

refinements, but the “scandal of the cross” led the early Christians
thus to retort upon the heathen; and the *Labarum* may have been the
fruit of this very suggestion.\]
