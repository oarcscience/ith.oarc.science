<span id="viii.iv.lxii"></span>

### <span id="viii.iv.lxii-p0.1"></span>Chapter LXII.—The words “Let Us make man” agree with the testimony of Proverbs.

<span id="viii.iv.lxii-p1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.lxii-p1.1"></span>“And the same sentiment was expressed, my
friends, by the word of God \[written\] by Moses, when it indicated to
us, with regard to Him whom it has pointed out, <span
id="fr_2172"></span>[2173](#fn_2172.md) that God speaks in the creation of
man with the very same design, in the following words: ‘Let Us make man
after our image and likeness. And let them have dominion over the fish
of the sea, and over the fowl of the heaven, and over the cattle, and
over all the earth, and over all the creeping things that creep on the
earth. And God created man: after the image of God did He create him;
male and female created He them. And God blessed them, and said,
Increase and multiply, and fill the earth, and have power over
it.’ <span id="fr_2173"></span>[2174](#fn_2173.md) And that you may not
change the \[force of the\] words just quoted, and repeat what your
teachers assert,—either that God said to Himself, ‘Let Us make,’ just as
we, when about to do something, oftentimes say to ourselves, ‘Let us
make;’ or that God spoke to the elements, to wit, the earth and other
similar substances of which we believe man was formed, ‘Let Us make,’—I
shall quote again the words narrated by Moses himself, from which we can
indisputably learn that \[God\] conversed with some one who was
numerically distinct from Himself, and also a rational Being. These are
the words: ‘And God said, Behold, Adam has become as one of us, to know
good and evil.’ <span id="fr_2174"></span>[2175](#fn_2174.md) In saying,
therefore, ‘as one of us,’ \[Moses\] has declared that \[there is a
certain\] number of persons associated with one another, and that they
are at least two. For I would not say that the dogma of that
heresy <span id="fr_2175"></span>[2176](#fn_2175.md) which is said to be
among you <span id="fr_2176"></span>[2177](#fn_2176.md) is true, or that
the teachers of it can prove that \[God\] spoke to angels, or that the
human frame was the workmanship of angels. <span
id="viii.iv.lxii-p6.2"></span>But this Offspring, which was truly
brought forth from the Father, was with the Father before all the
creatures, and the Father communed with Him; even as the Scripture by
Solomon has made clear, that He whom Solomon calls Wisdom, was begotten
as a Beginning before all His creatures and as Offspring by God, who has
also declared this same thing in the revelation made by Joshua the son
of Nave (Nun). Listen, therefore, to the following from the book of
Joshua, that what I say may become manifest to you; it is this: ‘And it
came to pass, when Joshua was near Jericho, he lifted up his eyes, and
sees a man standing over against him. And Joshua approached to Him, and
said, Art thou for us, or for our adversaries? And He said to him, I am
Captain of the Lord’s host: now have I come. And Joshua fell on his face
on the ground, and said to Him, Lord, what commandest Thou Thy servant?
And the Lord’s Captain says to Joshua, Loose the shoes off thy feet; for
the place whereon thou standest is holy ground. And Jericho was shut up
and fortified, and no one went out of it. And the Lord said to Joshua,
Behold, I give into thine hand Jericho, and its king, \[and\] its mighty
men.’ ” <span id="fr_2177"></span>[2178](#fn_2177.md)

<span id="viii.iv.lxii-p2"></span> Justin, since he is of opinion that
the Word is the beginning of the universe, thinks that by these words,
“in the beginning,” Moses indicated the Word, like many other writers.
Hence also he says in [Ap. i. 23](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#023.md)<span
id="viii.iv.lxii-p2.1"></span>, that Moses declares the Word “to be
begotten first by God.” If this explanation does not satisfy, read,
“with regard to Him whom I have pointed out” (Maranus).

id="viii.iv.lxii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="viii.iv.lxii-p6"></span> Or, “among us.” Maranus pronounces
against this latter reading for the following reasons: (1.) The Jews had
their own heresies which supplied many things to the Christian heresies,
especially to Menander and Saturninus. (2.) The sect which Justin here
refutes was of opinion that God spoke to angels. But those angels, as
Menander and Saturninus invented, “exhorted themselves, saying, Let us
make,” etc. (3.) The expression <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.iv.lxii-p6.1"></span>διδάσκαλοι</span> suits the rabbins well.
So Justin frequently calls them. (4.) Those teachers seem for no other
cause to have put the words in the angels’ mouths than to eradicate the
testimony by which they proved divine persons.
