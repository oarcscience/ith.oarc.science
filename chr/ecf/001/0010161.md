### <span id="v.iii.xv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XV.—Salutations.

<span id="v.iii.xv-p1"></span><span id="v.iii.xv-p1.1"></span>The
Ephesians from Smyrna (whence I also write to you), who are here for the
glory of God, as ye also are, who have in all things refreshed me,
salute you, along with Polycarp, the bishop of the Smyrnæans. The rest
of the Churches, in honour of Jesus Christ, also salute you. Fare ye
well in the harmony of God, ye who have obtained the inseparable Spirit,
who is Jesus Christ.

<span id="v.iii.xv-p2"></span><span id="v.iii.xv-p2.1"></span>The
Ephesians from Smyrna (whence I also write to you), who are here for the
glory of God, as ye also are, who have in all things refreshed me,
salute you, as does also Polycarp. The rest of the Churches, in honour
of Jesus Christ, also salute you. Fare ye well in harmony, ye who have
obtained the inseparable Spirit, in Christ Jesus, by the will of God.
