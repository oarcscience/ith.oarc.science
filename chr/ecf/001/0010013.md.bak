### <span id="ii.ii.viii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VIII.—Continuation respecting repentance.

<span id="ii.ii.viii-p1"></span><span id="ii.ii.viii-p1.1"></span><span
id="ii.ii.viii-p1.2"></span>The ministers of the grace of God have, by
the Holy Spirit, spoken of repentance; and the Lord of all things has
himself declared with an oath regarding it, “As I live, saith the Lord,
I desire not the death of the sinner, but rather his repentance;” <span
id="fr_37"></span>[38](#fn_37.md) adding, moreover, this gracious
declaration, “Repent, O house of Israel, of your iniquity. <span
id="fr_38"></span>[39](#fn_38.md) Say to the children of My people, Though
your sins reach from earth to heaven, I and though they be redder <span
id="fr_39"></span>[40](#fn_39.md) than scarlet, and blacker than sackcloth,
yet if ye turn to Me with your whole heart, and say, Father! I will
listen to you, as to a holy <span id="fr_40"></span>[41](#fn_40.md)
people.” And in another place He speaks thus: “Wash you, and become
clean; put away the wickedness of your souls from before mine eyes;
cease from your evil ways, and learn to do well; seek out judgment,
deliver the oppressed, judge the fatherless, and see that justice is
done to the widow; and come, and let us reason together. He declares,
Though your sins be like crimson, I will make them white as snow; though
they be like scarlet, I will whiten them like wool. And if ye be willing
and obey Me, ye shall eat the good of the land; but if ye refuse, and
will not hearken unto Me, the sword shall devour you, for the mouth of
the Lord hath spoken these things.” <span id="fr_41"></span>[42](#fn_41.md)
Desiring, therefore, that all His beloved should be partakers of
repentance, He has, by His almighty will, established \[these
declarations\].
