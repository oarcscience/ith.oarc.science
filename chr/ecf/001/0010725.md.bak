### <span id="ix.ii.xxix-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXVIII.—Doctrines of Tatian, the Encratites, and others.

<span id="ix.ii.xxix-p1"></span>1. Many offshoots of numerous heresies
have already been formed from those heretics we have described. This
arises from the fact that numbers of them—indeed, we may say all—desire
themselves to be teachers, and to break off from the particular heresy
in which they have been involved. Forming one set of doctrines out of a
totally different system of opinions, and then again others from others,
they insist upon teaching something new, declaring themselves the
inventors of any sort of opinion which they may have been able to call
into existence. <span id="ix.ii.xxix-p1.1"></span>To give an example:
Springing from Saturninus and Marcion, those who are called Encratites
(self-controlled) preached against marriage, thus setting aside the
original creation of God, and indirectly blaming Him who made the male
and female for the propagation of the human race. Some of those reckoned
among them have also introduced abstinence from animal food, thus
proving themselves ungrateful to God, who formed all things. They deny,
too, the salvation of him who was first created. It is but lately,
however, that this opinion has been invented among them. <span
id="ix.ii.xxix-p1.2"></span>A certain man named Tatian first introduced
the blasphemy. He was a hearer of Justin’s, and as long as he continued
with him he expressed no such views; but after his martyrdom he
separated from the Church, and, excited and puffed up by the thought of
being a teacher, as if he were superior to others, he composed his own
peculiar type of doctrine. He invented a system of certain invisible
Æons, like the followers of Valentinus; while, like Marcion and
Saturninus, he declared that marriage was nothing else than corruption
and fornication. <span id="fr_2961"></span>[2962](#fn_2961.md) But his
denial of Adam’s salvation was an opinion due entirely to himself.

<span id="ix.ii.xxix-p3"></span>2. Others, again, following upon
Basilides and Carpocrates, have introduced promiscuous intercourse and a
plurality of wives, and are indifferent about eating meats sacrificed to
idols, maintaining that God does not greatly regard such matters. But
why continue? For it is an impracticable attempt to mention all those
who, in one way or another, have fallen away from the truth.

Trent divines, *De Matrimonio*, proceeds on this principle: marriage is
licensed evil.\]
