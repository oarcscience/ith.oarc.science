### <span id="viii.iv.xci-p0.1"></span>Chapter XCI.—The cross was foretold in the blessings of Joseph, and in the serpent that was lifted up.

<span id="viii.iv.xci-p1"></span>“And God by Moses shows in another way
the force of the mystery of the cross, when He said in the blessing
wherewith Joseph was blessed, <span id="page_245">p. 245</span> <span
id="viii.iv.xci-Page_245"></span> ‘From the blessing of the Lord is his
land; for the seasons of heaven, and for the dews, and for the deep
springs from beneath, and for the seasonable fruits of the sun, <span
id="fr_2302"></span>[2303](#fn_2302.md) and for the coming together of the
months, and for the heights of the everlasting mountains, and for the
heights of the hills, and for the ever-flowing rivers, and for the
fruits of the fatness of the earth; and let the things accepted by Him
who appeared in the bush come on the head and crown of Joseph. Let him
be glorified among his brethren; <span
id="fr_2303"></span>[2304](#fn_2303.md) his beauty is \[like\] the
firstling of a bullock; his horns the horns of an unicorn: with these
shall he push the nations from one end of the earth to another.’ <span
id="fr_2304"></span>[2305](#fn_2304.md) Now, no one could say or prove that
the horns of an unicorn represent any other fact or figure than the type
which portrays the cross. For the one beam is placed upright, from which
the highest extremity is raised up into a horn, when the other beam is
fitted on to it, and the ends appear on both sides as horns joined on to
the one horn. And the part which is fixed in the centre, on which are
suspended those who are crucified, also stands out like a horn; and it
also looks like a horn conjoined and fixed with the other horns. And the
expression, ‘With these shall he push as with horns the nations from one
end of the earth to another,’ is indicative of what is now the fact
among all the nations. For some out of all the nations, through the
power of this mystery, having been so pushed, that is, pricked in their
hearts, have turned from vain idols and demons to serve God. But the
same figure is revealed for the destruction and condemnation of the
unbelievers; even as Amalek was defeated and Israel victorious when the
people came out of Egypt, by means of the type of the stretching out of
Moses’ hands, and the name of Jesus (Joshua), by which the son of Nave
(Nun) was called. And it seems that the type and sign, which was erected
to counteract the serpents which bit Israel, was intended for the
salvation of those who believe that death was declared to come
thereafter on the serpent through Him that would be crucified, but
salvation to those who had been bitten by him and had betaken themselves
to Him that sent His Son into the world to be crucified. <span
id="fr_2305"></span>[2306](#fn_2305.md) For the Spirit of prophecy by Moses
did not teach us to believe in the serpent, since it shows us that he
was cursed by God from the beginning; and in Isaiah tells us that he
shall be put to death as an enemy by the mighty sword, which is Christ.
