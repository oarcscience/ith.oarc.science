### <span id="ii.ii.ix-p0.1"></span>Chapter IX.—Examples of the saints.

<span id="ii.ii.ix-p1"></span><span id="ii.ii.ix-p1.1"></span>Wherefore,
let us yield obedience to His excellent and glorious will; and imploring
His mercy and loving-kindness, while we forsake all fruitless
labours, <span id="fr_42"></span>[43](#fn_42.md) and strife, and envy,
which leads to death, let us turn and have recourse to His compassions.
Let us stedfastly contemplate those who have perfectly ministered to His
excellent glory. <span id="ii.ii.ix-p2.2"></span>Let us take (for
instance) Enoch, who, being found righteous in obedience, was
translated, and death was never known to happen to him. <span
id="fr_43"></span>[44](#fn_43.md) Noah, being found faithful, preached
regeneration to the world through his ministry; and the Lord saved by
him the animals which, with one accord, entered into the ark.
