### <span id="viii.viii.ix-p0.1"></span>Chapter IX.—The resurrection of Christ proves that the body rises.

<span id="viii.viii.ix-p1"></span><span
id="viii.viii.ix-p1.1"></span><span id="viii.viii.ix-p1.2"></span><span
id="viii.viii.ix-p1.3"></span>If He had no need of the flesh, why did He
heal it? And what is most forcible of all, He raised the dead. Why? Was
it not to show what the resurrection should be? How then did He raise
the dead? Their souls or their bodies? Manifestly both. If the
resurrection were only spiritual, it was requisite that He, in raising
the dead, should show the body lying apart by itself, and the soul
living apart by itself. But now He did not do so, but raised the body,
confirming in it the promise of life. Why did He rise in the flesh in
which He suffered, unless to show the resurrection of the flesh? And
wishing to confirm this, when His disciples did not know whether to
believe He had truly risen in the body, and were looking upon Him and
doubting, He said to them, “Ye have not yet faith, see that it is
I;” <span id="fr_2632"></span>[2633](#fn_2632) and He let them handle
Him, and showed them the prints of the nails in His hands. And when they
were by every kind of proof persuaded that it was Himself, and in the
body, they asked Him to eat with them, that they might thus still more
accurately ascertain that He had in verity risen bodily; and He did eat
honey-comb and fish. And when He had thus shown them that there is truly
a resurrection of the flesh, wishing to show them this also, that it is
not impossible for flesh to ascend into heaven (as He had said that our
dwelling-place is in heaven), “He was taken up into heaven while they
beheld,” <span id="fr_2633"></span>[2634](#fn_2633) as He was in the
flesh. If, therefore, after all that has been said, any one demand
demonstration of the resurrection, he is in no respect different from
the Sadducees, since the resurrection of the flesh is the power of God,
and, being above all reasoning, is established by faith, and seen in
works.
