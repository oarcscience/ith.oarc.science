### <span id="viii.vi.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.—Opinions of Pythagoras and Epicurus.

<span id="viii.vi.iv-p1"></span><span id="viii.vi.iv-p1.1"></span><span
id="viii.vi.iv-p1.2"></span><span id="viii.vi.iv-p1.3"></span>Then, in
regular succession from another starting-point, Pythagoras the Samian,
son of Mnesarchus, calls numbers, with their proportions and harmonies,
and the elements composed of both, the first principles; and he includes
also unity and the indefinite binary. <span
id="fr_2518"></span>[2519](#fn_2518.md) <span
id="viii.vi.iv-p2.2"></span>Epicurus, an Athenian, the son of Neocles,
says that the first principles of the things that exist are bodies
perceptible by reason, admitting no vacuity, <span
id="fr_2519"></span>[2520](#fn_2519.md) unbegotten, indestructible, which
can neither be broken, nor admit of any formation of their parts, nor
alteration, and are therefore perceptible by reason. Empedocles of
Agrigentum, <span id="page_275">p. 275</span> <span
id="viii.vi.iv-Page_275"></span> son of Meton, maintained that there
were four elements—fire, air, water, earth; and two elementary powers
—love and hate, <span id="fr_2520"></span>[2521](#fn_2520.md) of which the
former is a power of union, the latter of separation. You see, then, the
confusion of those who are considered by you to have been wise men, whom
you assert to be your teachers of religion: some of them declaring that
water is the first principle of all things; others, air others, fire;
and others, some other of these fore-mentioned elements; and all of them
employing persuasive arguments for the establishment of their own
errors, and attempting to prove their own peculiar dogma to be the most
valuable. These things were said by them. How then, ye men of Greece,
can it be safe for those who desire to be saved, to fancy that they can
learn the true religion from these philosophers, who were neither able
so to convince themselves as to prevent sectarian wrangling with one
another, and not to appear definitely opposed to one another’s opinions?

<span id="viii.vi.iv-p2"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.vi.iv-p2.1"></span>μονάδα καὶ τὴν ἀόριστον δυάδα</span>. One,
or unity, was considered by Pythagoras as the essence of number, and
also as God. Two, or the indefinite binary, was the equivalent of evil.
So Plutarch, *De placit. philosoph.*, c. 7; from which treatise the
above opinions of the various sects are quoted, generally *verbatim*.

<span id="fn_2519"></span>[274:2520](0010614.htm#fr_2519.md) <span

<span id="viii.vi.iv-p3"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.vi.iv-p3.1"></span>ἀμέτοχα κενοῦ</span>: the void being that in
which these bodies move, while they themselves are of a different nature
from it.

<span id="fn_2520"></span>[275:2521](0010614.htm#fr_2520.md) <span

<span id="viii.vi.iv-p4"></span> Or, accord and discord, attraction and
repulsion.
