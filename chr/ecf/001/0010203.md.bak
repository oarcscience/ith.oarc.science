### <span id="v.vii.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.—Beware of these heretics.

<span id="v.vii.iv-p1"></span>I give you these instructions, beloved,
assured that ye also hold the same opinions \[as I do\]. But I <span
id="page_88">p. 88</span> <span id="v.vii.iv-Page_88"></span> guard you
beforehand from those beasts in the shape of men, whom you must not only
not receive, but, if it be possible, not even meet with; only you must
pray to God for them, if by any means they may be brought to repentance,
which, however, will be very difficult. Yet Jesus Christ, who is our
true life, has the power of \[effecting\] this. But if these things were
done by our Lord only in appearance, then am I also only in appearance
bound. And why have I also surrendered myself to death, to fire, to the
sword, to the wild beasts? But, \[in fact,\] he who is near to the sword
is near to God; he that is among the wild beasts is in company with God;
provided only he be so in the name of Jesus Christ. I undergo all these
things that I may suffer together with Him, <span
id="fr_1000"></span>[1001](#fn_1000.md) He who became a perfect man
inwardly strengthening me. <span id="fr_1001"></span>[1002](#fn_1001.md)

<span id="v.vii.iv-p4"></span>I give you these instructions, beloved,
assured that ye also hold the same opinions \[as I do\]. But I guard you
beforehand from these beasts in the shape of men, from whom you must not
only turn away, but even flee from them. Only you must pray for them, if
by any means they may be brought to repentance. For if the Lord were in
the body in appearance only, and were crucified in appearance only, then
am I also bound in appearance only. And why have I also surrendered
myself to death, to fire, to the sword, to the wild beasts? But, \[in
fact,\] I endure all things for Christ, not in appearance only, but in
reality, that I may suffer together with Him, while He Himself inwardly
strengthens me; for of myself I have no such ability.
