### <span id="viii.vii.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.—Testimonies to a future judgment.

<span id="viii.vii.iii-p1"></span><span
id="viii.vii.iii-p1.1"></span><span id="viii.vii.iii-p1.2"></span>Then
further concerning Him, that He alone is powerful, both to institute
judgment on the deeds performed in life, and on the ignorance of the
Deity \[displayed by men\], I can adduce witnesses from your own ranks;
and first Sophocles, <span id="fr_2599"></span>[2600](#fn_2599.md) who
speaks as follows:—

> <span id="viii.vii.iii-p2.2"></span>“That time of times shall come,
> shall surely come,  
> When from the golden ether down shall fall  
> Fire’s teeming treasure, and in burning flames  
> All things of earth and heaven shall be consumed;  
> And then, when all creation is dissolved,  
> The sea’s last wave shall die upon the shore,  
> The bald earth stript of trees, the burning air  
> No winged thing upon its breast shall bear.  
> There are two roads to Hades, well we know; <span
> id="fr_2600"></span>[2601](#fn_2600.md)  
> By this the righteous, and by that the bad,  
> On to their separate fates shall tend; and He,  
> Who all things had destroyed, shall all things save.”  

<span id="viii.vii.iii-p4"></span><span
id="viii.vii.iii-p4.1"></span>And Philemon <span
id="fr_2601"></span>[2602](#fn_2601.md) again:—

> <span id="viii.vii.iii-p5.1"></span>“Think’st thou, Nicostratus, the
> dead, who here  
> Enjoyed whate’er of good life often man,  
> Escape the notice of Divinity,  
> As if they might forgotten be of Him?  
> Nay, there’s an eye of Justice watching all;  
> For if the good and bad find the same end,  
> Then go thou, rob, steal, plunder, at thy will,  
> Do all the evil that to thee seems good.  
> Yet be not thou deceived; for underneath  
> There is a throne and place of judgment set,  
> Which God the Lord of all shall occupy;  
> Whose name is terrible, nor shall I dare  
> To breathe it forth in feeble human speech.”  

<span id="viii.vii.iii-p6"></span><span
id="viii.vii.iii-p6.1"></span>And Euripides: <span
id="fr_2602"></span>[2603](#fn_2602.md) —

> <span id="viii.vii.iii-p7.1"></span>“Not grudgingly he gives a lease
> of life,  
> That we the holders may be fairly judged;  
> And if a mortal man doth think to hide  
> His daily guilt from the keen eye of God,  
> It is an evil thought; so if perchance  
> He meets with leisure-taking Justice, she  
> Demands him as her lawful prisoner:  
> But many of you hastily commit  
> A twofold sin, and say there is no God.  
> But, ah! there is; there is. Then see that he  
> Who, being wicked, prospers, may redeem  
> The time so precious, else hereafter waits  
> For him the due reward of punishment.”

id="viii.vii.iii-p2.12"></span>

<span id="viii.vii.iii-p3"></span> Some propose to insert these three
lines in the centre of the next quotation from Philemon, after the line,
“Nay, there’s an eye,” etc.

<span id="fn_2601"></span>[291:2602](0010652.htm#fr_2601.md) <span
id="viii.vii.iii-p4.2"></span>

<span id="viii.vii.iii-p5"></span> Some say *Diphilus*.

<span id="fn_2602"></span>[291:2603](0010652.htm#fr_2602.md) <span
id="viii.vii.iii-p6.2"></span>

<span id="viii.vii.iii-p7"></span> Grotius joins these lines to the
preceding. Clement of Alexandria assigns them, and the others, which are
under the name of Euripides, to Diphilus.
