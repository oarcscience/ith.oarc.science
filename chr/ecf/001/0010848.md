### <span id="ix.vii.xi-p0.1"></span>Chapter X.—By a comparison drawn from the wild olive-tree, whose quality but not whose nature is changed by grafting, he proves more important things; he points out also that man without the Spirit is not capable of bringing forth fruit, or of inheriting the kingdom of God.

<span id="ix.vii.xi-p1"></span>1. <span id="ix.vii.xi-p1.1"></span><span
id="ix.vii.xi-p1.2"></span>This truth, therefore, \[he declares\], in
order that we may not reject the engrafting of the Spirit while
pampering the flesh. “But thou, being a wild olive-tree,” he says, “hast
been grafted into the good olive-tree, and been made a partaker of the
fatness of the olive-tree.” <span id="fr_4511"></span>[4512](#fn_4511.md)
As, therefore, when the wild olive has been engrafted, if it remain in
its former condition, viz., a wild olive, it is “cut off, and cast into
the fire;” <span id="fr_4512"></span>[4513](#fn_4512.md) but if it takes
kindly to the graft, and is changed into the good olive-tree, it becomes
a fruit-bearing olive, planted, as it were, in a king’s park
(*paradiso*): so likewise men, if they do truly progress by faith
towards better things, and receive the Spirit of God, and bring forth
the fruit thereof, shall be spiritual, as being planted in the paradise
of God. But if they cast out the Spirit, and remain in their former
condition, desirous of being of the flesh rather than of the Spirit,
then it is very justly said with regard to men of this stamp, “That
flesh and blood shall not inherit the kingdom of God;” <span
id="fr_4513"></span>[4514](#fn_4513.md) just as if any one were to say that
the wild olive is not received into the paradise of God. Admirably
therefore does the apostle exhibit our nature, and God’s universal
appointment, in his discourse about flesh and blood and the wild olive.
For as the good olive, if neglected for a certain time, if left to grow
wild and to run to wood, does itself become a wild olive; or again, if
the wild olive be carefully tended and grafted, it naturally reverts to
its former fruit-bearing condition: so men also, when they become
careless, and bring forth for fruit the lusts of the flesh like woody
produce, are rendered, by their own fault, unfruitful in righteousness.
For when men sleep, the enemy sows the material of tares; <span
id="fr_4514"></span>[4515](#fn_4514.md) and for this cause did the Lord
command His disciples to be on the watch. <span
id="fr_4515"></span>[4516](#fn_4515.md) And again, those persons who are
not bringing forth the fruits of righteousness, and are, as it were,
covered over and lost among brambles, if they use diligence, and receive
the word of God as a graft, <span id="fr_4516"></span>[4517](#fn_4516.md)
arrive at the pristine nature of man—that which was created after the
image and likeness of God.

<span id="ix.vii.xi-p8"></span>2. But as the engrafted wild olive does
not certainly lose the substance of its wood, but changes the quality of
its fruit, and receives another name, being now not a wild olive, but a
fruit-bearing olive, and is called so; so also, when man is grafted in
by faith and receives the Spirit of God, he certainly does not lose the
substance of flesh, but changes the quality of the fruit \[brought
forth, i.e.,\] of his works, and receives another name, <span
id="fr_4517"></span>[4518](#fn_4517.md) showing that he has become changed
for the better, being now not \[mere\] flesh and blood, but a spiritual
man, and is called such. <span id="ix.vii.xi-p9.2"></span><span
id="ix.vii.xi-p9.3"></span>Then, again, as the wild olive, if it be not
grafted in, remains useless to its lord because of its woody quality,
and is cut down as a tree bearing no fruit, and cast into the fire; so
also man, if he does not receive through faith the engrafting of the
Spirit, remains in his old condition, and being \[mere\] flesh and
blood, he cannot inherit the kingdom of God. Rightly therefore does the
apostle declare, “Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of
God;” <span id="fr_4518"></span>[4519](#fn_4518.md) and, “Those who are in
the flesh cannot please God:” <span id="fr_4519"></span>[4520](#fn_4519.md)
not repudiating \[by these words\] the substance of flesh, but showing
that into it the Spirit must be infused. <span
id="fr_4520"></span>[4521](#fn_4520.md) And for this reason, he says, “This
mortal must put on immortality, and this corruptible must put on
incorruption.” <span id="fr_4521"></span>[4522](#fn_4521.md) And again he
declares, “But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that
the Spirit of God dwell in you.” <span
id="fr_4522"></span>[4523](#fn_4522.md) He sets this forth still more
plainly, where he says, “The body indeed is dead, because of sin; but
the Spirit is life, because of righteousness. But if the Spirit of Him
who raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, He that raised up Christ
from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies, because of His
Spirit dwelling in you.” <span id="fr_4523"></span>[4524](#fn_4523.md) And
again he says, in the Epistle to the Romans, “For if ye live after the
flesh, ye shall die.” <span id="fr_4524"></span>[4525](#fn_4524.md) \[Now
by these words\] he does not prohibit them from living their lives in
the flesh, for he was himself in the flesh when he wrote to them; but he
cuts away the lusts of the flesh, those which bring death upon a man.
And for this reason he says in continuation, “But if ye through the
Spirit do mortify the works of the flesh, ye shall live. For whosoever
are led by the Spirit of God, these are the sons of God.”
