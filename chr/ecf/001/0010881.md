<span id="ix.viii.vi-p1"></span><span
id="ix.viii.vi-p1.1"></span>Since <span
id="fr_4809"></span>[4810](#fn_4809.md) God is vast, and the Architect of
the world, and omnipotent, He created things that reach to immensity
both by the Architect of the world and by an omnipotent will, and with a
new effect, potently and efficaciously, in order that the entire fulness
of those things which have been produced might come into being, although
they had no previous existence—that is, whatever does not fall under
\[our\] observation, and also what lies before our eyes. And so does He
contain all things in particular, and leads them on to their own proper
result, on account of which they were called into being and produced, in
no way changed into anything else than what it (the end) had originally
been by nature. For this is the property of the working of God, not
merely to proceed to the infinitude of the understanding, or even to
overpass \[our\] powers of mind, reason and speech, time and place, and
every age; but also to go beyond substance, and fulness or perfection.

<span id="ix.viii.vi-p2"></span> We owe this fragment also to Maximus,
who quoted it from the same work, *de Fide*, written by Irenæus to
Demetrius, a deacon of Vienne. This and the last fragment were first
printed by Feuardentius, who obtained them from Faber; no reference,
however, being given as to the source from whence the Latin version was
derived. The Greek of the Fragment vi. is not extant.
