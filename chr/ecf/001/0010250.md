### <span id="v.xii.viii-p0.1"></span>Chapter IX. <span id="fr_1171"></span>[1172](#fn_1171.md)

<span id="v.xii.viii-p2"></span><span id="v.xii.viii-p2.1"></span>My
spirit saluteth you, and the love of the Churches which received me as
the name of Jesus Christ; for those also who were near to \[my\] way in
the flesh, preceded me in every city.

<span id="v.xii.viii-p3"></span> <span
id="fr_1172"></span>[1173](#fn_1172.md) \[Now therefore, being about to
arrive shortly in Rome, I know many things in God; but I keep myself
within measure, that I may not perish through boasting: for now it is
needful for me to fear the more, and not pay regard to those who puff me
up. For they who say such things to me scourge me; for I desire to
suffer, but I do not know if I am worthy. For zeal is not visible to
many, but with me it has war. I have need, therefore, of meekness, by
which the prince of this world is destroyed. I am able to write to you
of heavenly things, but I fear lest I should do you an injury. Know me
from myself. For I am cautious lest ye should not be able to receive
\[such knowledge\], and should be perplexed. For even I, not because I
am in bonds, and am able to know heavenly things, and the places of
angels, and the stations of the powers that are seen and that are not
seen, am on this account a disciple; for I am far short of the
perfection which is worthy of God.\] Be ye perfectly strong <span
id="fr_1173"></span>[1174](#fn_1173.md) in the patience of Jesus Christ our
God.

<span id="v.xii.viii-p6"></span>Here end the three Epistles of Ignatius,
bishop and martyr. <span id="fr_1174"></span>[1175](#fn_1174.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1171"></span>[104:1172](0010250.htm#fr_1171.md) <span
id="v.xii.viii-p0.2"></span>

<span id="v.xii.viii-p1"></span> Chap. viii. of the Greek is entirely
omitted in the Syriac.

<span id="fn_1172"></span>[104:1173](0010250.htm#fr_1172.md) <span
id="v.xii.viii-p3.1"></span>

<span id="v.xii.viii-p4"></span> The following passage is not found in
this Epistle in the Greek recensions, but forms, in substance, chaps.
iv. and v. of the Epistle to the Trallians. Diverse views are held by
critics as to its proper place, according to the degree of authority
they ascribe to the Syriac version. Cureton maintains that this passage
has been transferred by fabrication by introducing a part of the genuine
writing of Ignatius; while Hefele asserts that it is bound by the
“closest connection” to the preceding chapter in the Epistle to the
Trallians.

<span id="fn_1173"></span>[104:1174](0010250.htm#fr_1173.md) <span
id="v.xii.viii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="v.xii.viii-p5"></span> Or, as in the Greek, “Fare ye well, to
the end.”

<span id="fn_1174"></span>[104:1175](0010250.htm#fr_1174.md) <span
id="v.xii.viii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="v.xii.viii-p7"></span> \[N.B.—The aphoristic genius of
Ignatius seems to be felt by his Syrian abbreviator, who reduces whole
chapters to mere maxims.\]
