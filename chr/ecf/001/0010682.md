seventh day equally with the other days, “And there was evening, and
there was morning,” is a distinct indication of the consummation which
is to take place in it before it is finished, as the <span

fathers declare, especially St. Clement, and Irenæus, and Justin the
martyr and philosopher, who, commenting with exceeding wisdom on the
number six of the sixth day, affirms that the intelligent soul of man
and his five susceptible senses were the six works of the sixth day.
Whence also, having discoursed at length on the number six, he declares
that all things which have been framed by God are divided into six
classes,—viz., into things intelligent and immortal, such as are the
angels; into things reasonable and mortal, such as mankind; into things
sensitive and irrational, such as cattle, and birds, and fishes; into
things that can advance, and move, and are insensible, such as the
winds, and the clouds, and the waters, and the stars; into things which
increase and are immoveable, such as the trees; and into things which
are insensible and immoveable, such as the mountains, the earth, and
such like. For all the creatures of God, in heaven and on earth, fall
under one or other of these divisions, and are circumscribed by them.—
