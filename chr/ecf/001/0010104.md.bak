### <span id="iv.iv.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.—Polycarp is betrayed by a servant.

<span id="iv.iv.vi-p1"></span><span id="iv.iv.vi-p1.1"></span>And when
those who sought for him were at hand, he departed to another dwelling,
whither his pursuers immediately came after him. And when they found him
not, they seized upon two youths \[that were there\], one of whom, being
subjected to torture, confessed. It was thus impossible that he should
continue hid, since those that betrayed him were of his own household.
The Irenarch <span id="fr_428"></span>[429](#fn_428.md) then (whose office
is the same as that of the Cleronomus <span
id="fr_429"></span>[430](#fn_429) .md), by name Herod, hastened to bring
him into the stadium. <span id="iv.iv.vi-p3.1"></span> \[This all
happened\] that he might fulfil his special lot, being made a partaker
of Christ, and that they who betrayed him might undergo the punishment
of Judas himself.
