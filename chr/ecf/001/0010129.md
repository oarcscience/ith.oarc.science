### <span id="v.ii.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.—Have respect to the bishop as to Christ Himself.

<span id="v.ii.vi-p1"></span>Now the more any one sees the bishop
keeping silence, <span id="fr_526"></span>[527](#fn_526) the more ought
he to revere him. For we ought to receive every one whom the Master of
the house sends to be over His household, <span
id="fr_527"></span>[528](#fn_527) as we would do Him that sent him. It
is manifest, therefore, that we should look upon the bishop even as we
would upon the <span id="page_52">p. 52</span> <span
id="v.ii.vi-Page_52"></span> Lord Himself. And indeed Onesimus himself
greatly commends your good order in God, that ye all live according to
the truth, and that no sect <span id="fr_528"></span>[529](#fn_528) has
any dwelling-place among you. Nor, indeed, do ye hearken to any one
rather than to Jesus Christ speaking in truth.

<span id="v.ii.vi-p5"></span>The more, therefore, you see the bishop
silent, the more do you reverence him. For we ought to receive every one
whom the Master of the house sends to be over His household, <span
id="fr_529"></span>[530](#fn_529) as we would do Him that sent him. It
is manifest, therefore, that we should look upon the bishop even as we
would look upon the Lord Himself, standing, as he does, before the Lord.
For “it behoves the man who looks carefully about him, and is active in
his business, to stand before kings, and not to stand before slothful
men.” <span id="fr_530"></span>[531](#fn_530) And indeed Onesimus
himself greatly commends your good order in God, that ye all live
according to the truth, and that no sect has any dwelling-place among
you. Nor indeed do ye hearken to any one rather than to Jesus Christ,
the true Shepherd and Teacher. And ye are, as Paul wrote to you, “one
body and one spirit, because ye have also been called in one hope of the
faith. <span id="fr_531"></span>[532](#fn_531) Since also “there is one
Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, who is over
all, and through all, and in all.” <span
id="fr_532"></span>[533](#fn_532) Such, then, are ye, having been taught
by such instructors, Paul the Christ-bearer, and Timothy the most
faithful.
