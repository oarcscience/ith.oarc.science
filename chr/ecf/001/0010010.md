### <span id="ii.ii.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.—No less evils have arisen from the same source in the most recent times. The martyrdom of Peter and Paul.

<span id="ii.ii.v-p1"></span><span id="ii.ii.v-p1.1"></span><span
id="ii.ii.v-p1.2"></span><span id="ii.ii.v-p1.3"></span>But not to dwell
upon ancient examples, let us come to the most recent spiritual
heroes. <span id="fr_24"></span>[25](#fn_24) Let us take the noble
examples furnished in our own generation. Through envy and jealousy, the
greatest and most righteous pillars \[of the Church\] have been
persecuted and put to death. <span id="fr_25"></span>[26](#fn_25) Let us
set before our eyes the illustrious <span id="fr_26"></span>[27](#fn_26)
apostles. Peter, through unrighteous envy, endured not one or two, but
numerous labours and when he had at length suffered martyrdom, departed
to the place of glory due to him. Owing to envy, Paul also obtained the
reward of patient endurance, after being seven times thrown into
captivity, <span id="fr_27"></span>[28](#fn_27) compelled <span
id="fr_28"></span>[29](#fn_28) to flee, and stoned. After preaching both
in the east and west, he gained the illustrious reputation due to his
faith, having taught righteousness to the whole world, and come to the
extreme limit of the west, <span id="fr_29"></span>[30](#fn_29) and
suffered martyrdom under the prefects. <span
id="fr_30"></span>[31](#fn_30) Thus was he removed from the world, and
went into the holy place, having proved himself a striking example of
patience.

<span id="fn_24"></span>[6:25](0010010.htm#fr_24) <span
id="ii.ii.v-p1.4"></span>

<span id="ii.ii.v-p2"></span> Literally, “those who have been athletes.”

<span id="fn_25"></span>[6:26](0010010.htm#fr_25) <span
id="ii.ii.v-p2.1"></span>

<span id="ii.ii.v-p3"></span> Some fill up the *lacuna* here found in
the <span class="upper"><span id="ii.ii.v-p3.1"></span>ms.</span> so as
to read, “have come to a grievous death.”

<span id="fn_26"></span>[6:27](0010010.htm#fr_26) <span
id="ii.ii.v-p3.2"></span>

<span id="ii.ii.v-p4"></span> Literally, “good.” \[The martyrdom of St.
Peter is all that is thus connected with his arrival in Rome. His
numerous labours were restricted to the Circumcision.\]

<span id="fn_27"></span>[6:28](0010010.htm#fr_27) <span
id="ii.ii.v-p4.1"></span>

<span id="ii.ii.v-p5"></span> *Seven* imprisonments of St. Paul are not
referred to in Scripture.

<span id="fn_28"></span>[6:29](0010010.htm#fr_28) <span
id="ii.ii.v-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ii.ii.v-p6"></span> Archbishop Wake here reads “scourged.” We
have followed the most recent critics in filling up the numerous
*lacunæ* in this chapter.

<span id="fn_29"></span>[6:30](0010010.htm#fr_29) <span
id="ii.ii.v-p6.1"></span>

<span id="ii.ii.v-p7"></span> Some think *Rome*, others *Spain*, and
others even *Britain*, to be here referred to. \[See note at end.\]

<span id="fn_30"></span>[6:31](0010010.htm#fr_30) <span
id="ii.ii.v-p7.1"></span>

<span id="ii.ii.v-p8"></span> That is, under Tigellinus and Sabinus, in
the last year of the Emperor Nero; but some think Helius and Polycletus
referred to; and others, both here and in the preceding sentence, regard
the words as denoting simply the *witness* borne by Peter and Paul to
the truth of the gospel before the rulers of the earth.
