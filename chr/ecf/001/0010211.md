### <span id="v.vii.xii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XII.—Salutations.

<span id="v.vii.xii-p1"></span><span id="v.vii.xii-p1.1"></span>The love
of the brethren at Troas salutes you; whence also I write to <span
id="page_92">p. 92</span> <span id="v.vii.xii-Page_92"></span> you by
Burrhus, whom ye sent with me, together with the Ephesians, your
brethren, and who has in all things refreshed me. And I would that all
may imitate him, as being a pattern of a minister <span
id="fr_1055"></span>[1056](#fn_1055.md) of God. <span
id="v.vii.xii-p2.1"></span>Grace will reward him in all things. I salute
your most worthy <span id="fr_1056"></span>[1057](#fn_1056.md) bishop, and
your very venerable <span id="fr_1057"></span>[1058](#fn_1057.md)
presbytery, and your deacons, my fellow-servants, and all of you
individually, as well as generally, in the name of Jesus Christ, and in
His flesh and blood, in His passion and resurrection, both corporeal and
spiritual, in union with God and you. <span
id="fr_1058"></span>[1059](#fn_1058.md) Grace, mercy, peace, and patience,
be with you for evermore!

<span id="v.vii.xii-p6"></span><span id="v.vii.xii-p6.1"></span>The love
of your brethren at Troas salutes you; whence also I write to you by
Burgus, whom ye sent with me, together with the Ephesians, your
brethren, and who has in all things refreshed me. And I would that all
may imitate him, as being a pattern of a minister of God. <span
id="v.vii.xii-p6.2"></span>The grace of the Lord will reward him in all
things. <span id="v.vii.xii-p6.3"></span>I salute your most worthy
bishop Polycarp, and your venerable presbytery, and your Christ-bearing
deacons, my fellow-servants, and all of you individually, as well as
generally, in the name of Christ Jesus, and in His flesh and blood, in
His passion and resurrection, both corporeal and spiritual, in union
with God and you. Grace, mercy, peace, and patience, be with you in
Christ for evermore!
