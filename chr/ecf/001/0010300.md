### <span id="v.xvii.xii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XII.—The meek reply of Christ.

<span id="v.xvii.xii-p1"></span>But the Lord is long-suffering, and does
not reduce to nothing him who in his ignorance dares \[to utter\] such
words, but meekly replies, “Get thee hence, Satan.” <span
id="fr_1350"></span>[1351](#fn_1350.md) He does not say, “Get thee behind
Me,” for it is not possible that he should be converted; but, “Begone,
Satan,” to the course which thou hast chosen. “Begone” to those things
to which, through thy malevolence, thou hast been called. For I know Who
I am, and by Whom I have been sent, and Whom it behoves Me to worship.
For “thou shall worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou
serve.” <span id="fr_1351"></span>[1352](#fn_1351.md) I know the one
\[God\]; I am acquainted with the only \[Lord\] from whom thou hast
become an apostate. I am not an enemy of God; I acknowledge His
pre-eminence; I know the Father, who is the author of my generation.
