### <span id="v.v.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.—Allow me to fall a prey to the wild beasts.

<span id="v.v.iv-p1"></span><span id="v.v.iv-p1.1"></span>I write to the
Churches, and impress on them all, that I shall willingly die for God,
unless ye hinder me. I beseech of you not to show an unseasonable
good-will towards me. Suffer me to become food for the wild beasts,
through whose instrumentality it will be granted me to attain to God. I
am the wheat of God, and let me be ground by the teeth of the wild
beasts, that I may be found the pure bread of Christ. Rather entice the
wild beasts, that they may become my tomb, and may leave nothing of my
body; so that when I have fallen asleep \[in death\], I may be no
trouble to any one. Then shall I truly be a disciple of Christ, when the
world shall not see so much as my body. Entreat Christ for me, that by
these instruments <span id="fr_845"></span>[846](#fn_845.md) I may be found
a sacrifice \[to God\]. I do not, as Peter and Paul, issue commandments
unto you. They were apostles; I am but a condemned man: they were
free, <span id="fr_846"></span>[847](#fn_846.md) while I am, even until
now, a servant. But when I suffer, I shall be the freed-man of Jesus,
and shall rise again emancipated in Him. And now, being a prisoner, I
learn not to desire anything worldly or vain.

a sacrifice to God. I do not, as Peter and Paul, issue commandments unto
you. They were apostles of Jesus Christ, but I am the very least \[of
believers\]: they were free, <span id="fr_848"></span>[849](#fn_848.md) as
the servants of God; while I am, even until now, a servant. But when I
suffer, I shall be the freed-man of Jesus Christ, and shall rise again
emancipated in Him. And now, being in bonds for Him, I learn not to
desire anything worldly or vain.
