<span id="vi.ii.i"></span>

### <span id="vi.ii.i-p0.1"></span>Chapter I.—After the salutation, the writer declares that he would communicate to his brethren something of that which he had himself received.

<span id="vi.ii.i-p1"></span><span id="vi.ii.i-p1.1"></span><span
id="vi.ii.i-p1.2"></span><span class="upper"><span
id="vi.ii.i-p1.3"></span>All</span> hail, ye sons and daughters, in the
name of our Lord <span id="fr_1444"></span>[1445](#fn_1444.md) Jesus
Christ, who loved us in peace.

<span id="vi.ii.i-p3"></span>Seeing that the divine fruits <span
id="fr_1445"></span>[1446](#fn_1445.md) of righteousness abound among you,
I rejoice exceedingly and above measure in your happy and honoured
spirits, because ye have with such effect received the engrafted <span
id="fr_1446"></span>[1447](#fn_1446.md) spiritual gift. Wherefore also I
inwardly rejoice the more, hoping to be saved, because I truly perceive
in you the Spirit poured forth from the rich Lord <span
id="fr_1447"></span>[1448](#fn_1447.md) of love. Your greatly desired
appearance has thus filled me with astonishment over you. <span
id="fr_1448"></span>[1449](#fn_1448.md) I am therefore pursuaded of this,
and fully convinced in my own mind, that since I began to speak among
you I understand many things, because the Lord hath accompanied me in
the way of righteousness. <span id="vi.ii.i-p7.1"></span>I am also on
this account bound <span id="fr_1449"></span>[1450](#fn_1449.md) by the
strictest obligation to love you above my own soul, because great are
the faith and love dwelling in you, while you hope for the life which He
has promised. <span id="fr_1450"></span>[1451](#fn_1450.md) <span
id="vi.ii.i-p9.1"></span>Considering this, therefore, that if I should
take the trouble to communicate to you some portion of what I have
myself received, it will prove to me a sufficient reward that I minister
to such spirits, I have hastened briefly to write unto you, in order
that, along with your faith, ye might have perfect knowledge. The
doctrines of the Lord, then, are three: <span
id="fr_1451"></span>[1452](#fn_1451.md) the hope of life, the beginning and
the completion of it. For the Lord hath made known to us by the prophets
both the things which are past and present, giving us also the
first-fruits of the knowledge <span id="fr_1452"></span>[1453](#fn_1452.md)
of things to come, which things as we see accomplished, one by one, we
ought with the greater richness of faith <span
id="fr_1453"></span>[1454](#fn_1453.md) and elevation of spirit to draw
near to Him with reverence. <span id="fr_1454"></span>[1455](#fn_1454.md) I
then, not as your teacher, but as one of yourselves, will set forth a
few things by which in present circumstances ye may be rendered the more
joyful.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1444"></span>[137:1445](0010337.htm#fr_1444.md) <span
id="vi.ii.i-p1.4"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.i-p2"></span> The Cod. Sin. has simply, “the Lord.”

<span id="fn_1445"></span>[137:1446](0010337.htm#fr_1445.md) <span
id="vi.ii.i-p3.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.i-p4"></span> Literally, “the judgments of God being
great and rich towards you;” but, as Hefele remarks, <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.ii.i-p4.1"></span>δικαίωμα</span> seems here
to have the meaning of *righteousness*, as in [Rom. v.
18](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#018.md)<span id="vi.ii.i-p4.2"></span>.

<span id="fn_1446"></span>[137:1447](0010337.htm#fr_1446.md) <span
id="vi.ii.i-p4.3"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.i-p5"></span> This appears to be the meaning of the
Greek, and is confirmed by the ancient Latin version. Hilgenfeld,
however, following Cod. Sin., reads “thus,” instead of “because,” and
separates the clauses.

<span id="fn_1447"></span>[137:1448](0010337.htm#fr_1447.md) <span
id="vi.ii.i-p5.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.i-p6"></span> The Latin reads, “spirit infused into you
from the honourable fountain of God.”

<span id="fn_1448"></span>[137:1449](0010337.htm#fr_1448.md) <span
id="vi.ii.i-p6.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.i-p7"></span> This sentence is entirely omitted in the
Latin.

<span id="fn_1449"></span>[137:1450](0010337.htm#fr_1449.md) <span
id="vi.ii.i-p7.2"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.i-p8"></span> The Latin text is here quite different,
and seems evidently corrupt. We have followed the Cod. Sin., as does
Hilgenfeld.

<span id="fn_1450"></span>[137:1451](0010337.htm#fr_1450.md) <span
id="vi.ii.i-p8.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.i-p9"></span> Literally, “in the hope of His life.”

<span id="fn_1451"></span>[137:1452](0010337.htm#fr_1451.md) <span
id="vi.ii.i-p9.2"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.i-p10"></span> The Greek is here totally unintelligible:
it seems impossible either to punctuate or construe it. We may attempt
to represent it as follows: “The doctrines of the Lord, then, are three:
Life, Faith, and Hope, our beginning and end; and Righteousness, the
beginning and the end of judgment; Love and Joy and the Testimony of
gladness for works of righteousness.” We have followed the ancient Latin
text, which Hilgenfeld also adopts, though Weitzäcker and others prefer
the Greek.

<span id="fn_1452"></span>[137:1453](0010337.htm#fr_1452.md) <span
id="vi.ii.i-p10.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.i-p11"></span> Instead of “knowledge” (<span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.ii.i-p11.1"></span>γνώσεως</span>), Cod. Sin.
has “taste” (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ii.i-p11.2"></span>γεύσεως</span>).

<span id="fn_1453"></span>[137:1454](0010337.htm#fr_1453.md) <span
id="vi.ii.i-p11.3"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.i-p12"></span> Literally, “we ought more richly and
loftily to approach His fear.”

<span id="fn_1454"></span>[137:1455](0010337.htm#fr_1454.md) <span
id="vi.ii.i-p12.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.i-p13"></span> Instead of, “to Him with fear,” the
reading of Cod. Sin., the Latin has, “to His altar,” which Hilgenfeld
adopts.
