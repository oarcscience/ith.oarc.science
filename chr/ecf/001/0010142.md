### <span id="v.ii.xix-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIX.—Three celebrated mysteries.

<span id="v.ii.xix-p1"></span><span id="v.ii.xix-p1.1"></span><span
id="v.ii.xix-p1.2"></span><span id="v.ii.xix-p1.3"></span>Now the
virginity of Mary was hidden from the prince of this world, as was also
her offspring, and the death of the Lord; three mysteries of
renown, <span id="fr_612"></span>[613](#fn_612.md) which were wrought in
silence by <span id="fr_613"></span>[614](#fn_613.md) God. How, then, was
He manifested to the world? <span id="fr_614"></span>[615](#fn_614.md) A
star shone forth in heaven above all the other stars, the light of which
was inexpressible, while its novelty struck men with astonishment. And
all the rest of the stars, with the sun and moon, formed a chorus to
this star, and its light was exceedingly great above them all. And there
was agitation felt as to whence this new spectacle came, so unlike to
everything else \[in the heavens\]. Hence every kind of magic was
destroyed, and every bond of wickedness disappeared; ignorance was
removed, and the old kingdom abolished, God Himself being manifested in
human form for the renewal of eternal life. And now that took a
beginning which had been prepared by God. Henceforth all things were in
a state of tumult, because He meditated the abolition of death.

<span id="v.ii.xix-p5"></span><span id="v.ii.xix-p5.1"></span><span
id="v.ii.xix-p5.2"></span>Now the virginity of Mary was hidden from the
prince of this world, as was also her offspring, and the death of the
Lord; three mysteries of renown, <span id="fr_615"></span>[616](#fn_615.md)
which were wrought in silence, but have been revealed to us. A star
shone forth in heaven above all that were before it, and its light was
inexpressible, while its novelty struck men with astonishment. And all
the rest of the stars, with the sun and moon, formed a chorus to this
star. It far exceeded them all in brightness, and agitation was felt as
to whence this new spectacle \[proceeded\]. Hence worldly wisdom became
folly; conjuration was seen to be mere trifling; and magic became
utterly ridiculous. Every law <span id="fr_616"></span>[617](#fn_616.md) of
wickedness vanished away; the darkness of ignorance was dispersed; and
tyrannical authority was destroyed, God being manifested as a man, and
man displaying power as God. But neither was the former a mere
imagination, <span id="fr_617"></span>[618](#fn_617.md) nor did the second
imply a bare humanity; <span id="fr_618"></span>[619](#fn_618.md) but the
one was absolutely true, <span id="fr_619"></span>[620](#fn_619.md) and the
other an economical arrangement. <span id="fr_620"></span>[621](#fn_620.md)
Now that received a beginning which was perfected by God. <span
id="fr_621"></span>[622](#fn_621.md) Henceforth all things were in a state
of tumult, because He meditated the abolition of death.
