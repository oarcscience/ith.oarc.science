### <span id="viii.ii.lvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter LVI.—The demons still mislead men.

<span id="viii.ii.lvi-p1"></span><span
id="viii.ii.lvi-p1.1"></span><span id="viii.ii.lvi-p1.2"></span><span
id="viii.ii.lvi-p1.3"></span>But the evil spirits were not satisfied
with saying, before Christ’s appearance, that those who were said to be
sons of Jupiter were born of him; but after He had appeared, and been
born among men, and when they learned how He had been foretold by the
prophets, and knew that He should be believed on and looked for by every
nation, they again, as was said above, put forward other men, the
Samaritans Simon and Menander, who did many mighty works by magic, and
deceived many, and still keep them deceived. For even among yourselves,
as we said before, <span id="fr_1886"></span>[1887](#fn_1886.md) Simon was
in the royal city Rome in the reign of Claudius Cæsar, and so greatly
astonished the sacred senate and people of the Romans, that he was
considered a god, and honoured, like the others whom you honour as gods,
with a statue. Wherefore we pray that the sacred senate and your people
may, along with yourselves, be arbiters of this our memorial, in order
that if any one be entangled by that man’s doctrines, he may learn the
truth, and so be able to escape error; and as for the statue, if you
please, destroy it.
