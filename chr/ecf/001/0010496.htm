<p><a name="viii.iv.xxxv-p1"></A>And Trypho said, &#8220;I believe, however, that many of those who say that they confess Jesus, and are called Christians, eat meats offered to idols, and declare that they are by no means injured in consequence.&#8221; And I replied, &#8220;The fact that there are such men confessing themselves to be Christians, and admitting the crucified Jesus to be both Lord and Christ, yet not teaching His doctrines, but those of the spirits of error, causes us who are disciples of the true and pure doctrine of Jesus Christ, to be more faithful and stedfast in the hope announced by Him. For what things He predicted would take place in His name, these we do see being actually accomplished in our sight. For he said, &#145;Many shall come in My name, clothed outwardly in sheep&#146;s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.&#146; &#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2034"></A><A HREF="#fn_2034"><FONT SIZE="1">2035</FONT></A>
 And, &#145;There shall be schisms and heresies.&#146;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2035"></A><A HREF="#fn_2035"><FONT SIZE="1">2036</FONT></A>
 And, &#145;Beware of false prophets, who shall come to you clothed outwardly in sheep&#146;s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.&#146;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2036"></A><A HREF="#fn_2036"><FONT SIZE="1">2037</FONT></A>
 And, &#145;Many false Christs and false apostles shall arise, and shall deceive many of the faithful.&#146;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2037"></A><A HREF="#fn_2037"><FONT SIZE="1">2038</FONT></A>
 There are, therefore, and there were many, my friends, who, coming forward in the name of Jesus, taught both to speak and act impious and blasphemous things; and these are called by us after the name of the men from whom each doctrine and opinion had its origin. (For some in one way, others in another, teach to blaspheme the Maker of all things, and Christ, who was foretold by Him as coming, and the God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, with whom we have nothing in common, since we know them to be atheists, impious, unrighteous, and sinful, and confessors of Jesus in name only, instead of worshippers of Him. Yet they style themselves Christians, just as certain among the Gentiles inscribe the name of God upon the works of their own hands, and partake in nefarious and impious rites.) Some are called Marcians, and some Valentinians, and some Basilidians, and some Saturnilians, and others by other names; each called after the originator of the individual opinion, just as each one of those who consider themselves philosophers, as I said before, thinks he must bear the name of the philosophy which he follows, from the name of the father of the particular doctrine. So that, in consequence of these events, we know that Jesus foreknew what would happen after Him, as well as in consequence of many other events which He foretold would befall those who believed on and confessed Him, the Christ. For all that we suffer, even when killed by friends, He foretold would take place; so that it is manifest no word or act of His can be found fault with. Wherefore we pray for you and for all other men who hate us; in order that you, having repented along with us, may not blaspheme Him who, by His works, by the mighty deeds even now wrought through His name, by the words He taught, by the prophecies announced concerning Him, is the blameless, and in all things irreproachable, Christ Jesus; but, believing on Him, may be saved in His second glorious advent, and may not be condemned to fire by Him.&#8221;</p>
