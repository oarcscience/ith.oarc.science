<span id="vi.ii.iv"></span>

### <span id="vi.ii.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.—Antichrist is at hand: let us therefore avoid Jewish errors.

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p1"></span><span id="vi.ii.iv-p1.1"></span>It
therefore behoves us, who inquire much concerning events at hand, <span
id="fr_1467"></span>[1468](#fn_1467.md) to search diligently into those
things which are able to save us. <span id="vi.ii.iv-p2.1"></span>Let us
then utterly flee from all the works of iniquity, lest these should take
hold of us; and let us hate the error of the present time, that we may
set our love on the world to come: let us not give loose reins to our
soul, that it should have power to run with sinners and the wicked, lest
we become like them. <span id="vi.ii.iv-p2.2"></span>The final
stumbling-block (or source of danger) approaches, concerning which it is
written, as Enoch <span id="fr_1468"></span>[1469](#fn_1468.md) says, “For
for this end the Lord has cut short the times and the days, that His
Beloved may hasten; and He will come to the inheritance.” And the
prophet also speaks thus: “Ten kingdoms shall reign upon the earth, and
a little king shall rise up after them, who shall subdue under one three
of the kings.” <span id="fr_1469"></span>[1470](#fn_1469.md) In like manner
Daniel says concerning the same, “And I beheld the fourth beast, wicked
and powerful, and more savage than all the beasts of the earth, and how
from it sprang up ten horns, and out of them a little budding horn, and
how it subdued under one three of the great horns.” <span
id="fr_1470"></span>[1471](#fn_1470.md) Ye ought therefore to understand.
And this also I further beg of you, as being one of you, and loving you
both individually and collectively more than my own soul, to take heed
now to yourselves, and not to be like some, adding largely to your sins,
and saying, “The covenant is both theirs and ours.” <span
id="fr_1471"></span>[1472](#fn_1471.md) But they thus finally lost it,
after Moses had already received it. For the Scripture saith, “And Moses
was fasting in <span id="page_139">p. 139</span> <span
id="vi.ii.iv-Page_139"></span> the mount forty days and forty nights,
and received the covenant from the Lord, tables of stone written with
the finger of the hand of the Lord;” <span
id="fr_1472"></span>[1473](#fn_1472.md) but turning away to idols, they
lost it. For the Lord speaks thus to Moses: “Moses go down quickly; for
the people whom thou hast brought out of the land of Egypt have
transgressed.” <span id="fr_1473"></span>[1474](#fn_1473.md) And Moses
understood \[the meaning of God\], and cast the two tables out of his
hands; and their covenant was broken, in order that the covenant of the
beloved Jesus might be sealed upon our heart, in the hope which flows
from believing in Him. <span id="fr_1474"></span>[1475](#fn_1474.md) <span
id="vi.ii.iv-p9.1"></span>Now, being desirous to write many things to
you, not as your teacher, but as becometh one who loves you, I have
taken care not to fail to write to you from what I myself possess, with
a view to your purification. <span id="fr_1475"></span>[1476](#fn_1475.md)
We take earnest <span id="fr_1476"></span>[1477](#fn_1476.md) heed in these
last days; for the whole \[past\] time of your faith will profit you
nothing, unless now in this wicked time we also withstand coming sources
of danger, as becometh the sons of God. That the Black One <span
id="fr_1477"></span>[1478](#fn_1477.md) may find no means of entrance, let
us flee from every vanity, let us utterly hate the works of the way of
wickedness. Do not, by retiring apart, live a solitary life, as if you
were already \[fully\] justified; but coming together in one place, make
common inquiry concerning what tends to your general welfare. For the
Scripture saith, “Woe to them who are wise to themselves, and prudent in
their own sight!” <span id="fr_1478"></span>[1479](#fn_1478.md) Let us be
spiritually-minded: let us be a perfect temple to God. As much as in us
lies, let us meditate upon the fear of God, and let us keep His
commandments, that we may rejoice in His ordinances. The Lord will judge
the world without respect of persons. Each will receive as he has done:
if he is righteous, his righteousness will precede him; if he is wicked,
the reward of wickedness is before him. Take heed, lest resting at our
ease, as those who are the called \[of God\], we should fall asleep in
our sins, and the wicked prince, acquiring power over us, should thrust
us away from the kingdom of the Lord. And all the more attend to this,
my brethren, when ye reflect and behold, that after so great signs and
wonders were wrought in Israel, they were thus \[at length\] abandoned.
Let us beware lest we be found \[fulfilling that saying\], as it is
written, “Many are called, but few are chosen.” <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1467"></span>[138:1468](0010340.htm#fr_1467.md) <span
id="vi.ii.iv-p1.2"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p2"></span> Or it might be rendered, “things
present.” Cotelerius reads, “de his instantibus.”

<span id="fn_1468"></span>[138:1469](0010340.htm#fr_1468.md) <span
id="vi.ii.iv-p2.3"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p3"></span> The Latin reads, “Daniel” instead of
“Enoch;” comp. [Dan. ix. 24-27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024.md)<span
id="vi.ii.iv-p3.1"></span>.

<span id="fn_1469"></span>[138:1470](0010340.htm#fr_1469.md) <span

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p4"></span> [Dan. vii.
24](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#024.md)<span id="vi.ii.iv-p4.1"></span>,
very loosely quoted.

<span id="fn_1470"></span>[138:1471](0010340.htm#fr_1470.md) <span
id="vi.ii.iv-p4.2"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p5"></span> [Dan.
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#007.md),
[8](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#008.md)<span id="vi.ii.iv-p5.1"></span>,
also very inaccurately cited.

<span id="fn_1471"></span>[138:1472](0010340.htm#fr_1471.md) <span
id="vi.ii.iv-p5.2"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p6"></span> We here follow the Latin text in
preference to the Greek, which reads merely, “the covenant is ours.”
What follows seems to show the correctness of the Latin, as the author
proceeds to deny that the Jews had any further interest in the promises.

<span id="fn_1472"></span>[139:1473](0010340.htm#fr_1472.md) <span
id="vi.ii.iv-p6.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p7"></span> [Ex. xxxi.
18](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#018.md)<span id="vi.ii.iv-p7.1"></span>,
[Ex. xxxiv. 28](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#028.md)<span
id="vi.ii.iv-p7.2"></span>.

<span id="fn_1473"></span>[139:1474](0010340.htm#fr_1473.md) <span
id="vi.ii.iv-p7.3"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p8"></span> [Ex. xxxii.
7](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#007.md)<span id="vi.ii.iv-p8.1"></span>;
[Deut. ix. 12](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#012.md)<span
id="vi.ii.iv-p8.2"></span>.

<span id="fn_1474"></span>[139:1475](0010340.htm#fr_1474.md) <span
id="vi.ii.iv-p8.3"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p9"></span> Literally, “in hope of His faith.”

<span id="fn_1475"></span>[139:1476](0010340.htm#fr_1475.md) <span
id="vi.ii.iv-p9.2"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p10"></span> The Greek is here incorrect and
unintelligible; and as the Latin omits the clause, our translation is
merely conjectural. Hilgenfeld’s text, if we give a somewhat peculiar
meaning to <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ii.iv-p10.1"></span>ἐλλιπεῖν</span>, may be translated: “but as
it is becoming in one who loves you not to fail in giving you what we
have, I, though the very offscouring of you, have been eager to write to
you.”

<span id="fn_1476"></span>[139:1477](0010340.htm#fr_1476.md) <span
id="vi.ii.iv-p10.2"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p11"></span> So the Cod. Sin. Hilgenfeld reads, with
the Latin, “let us take.”

<span id="fn_1477"></span>[139:1478](0010340.htm#fr_1477.md) <span
id="vi.ii.iv-p11.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p12"></span> The Latin here departs entirely from the
Greek text, and quotes as a saying of “the Son of God” the following
precept, nowhere to be found in the New Testament: “Let us resist all
iniquity, and hold it in hatred.” Hilgenfeld joins this clause to the
former sentence.

<span id="fn_1478"></span>[139:1479](0010340.htm#fr_1478.md) <span
id="vi.ii.iv-p12.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p13"></span> [Isa. v.
21](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#021.md)<span id="vi.ii.iv-p13.1"></span>.

<span id="fn_1479"></span>[139:1480](0010340.htm#fr_1479.md) <span
id="vi.ii.iv-p13.2"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p14"></span> An exact quotation from [Matt. xx.
16](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#016.md)<span id="vi.ii.iv-p14.1"></span>or
[Matt. xxii. 14](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#014.md)<span
id="vi.ii.iv-p14.2"></span>. It is worthy of notice that this is the
first example in the writings of the Fathers of a citation from any book
of the New Testament, preceded by the authoritative formula, “it is
written.”
