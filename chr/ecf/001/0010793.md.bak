## <span id="ix.v-p0.1"></span>Elucidation

<span id="ix.v-p1"></span><span id="ix.v-p1.1"></span>The editor of this
American Series confines himself in general to such occasional and
*very* brief annotations as may suggest to students and others the
practical views which are requisite to a clear comprehension of authors
who wrote for past ages; for a sort and condition of men no longer
existing, whose extinction as a class is, indeed, largely due to these
writings. But he reserved to himself the privilege of correcting
palpable mistakes, especially in points which bear upon questions of our
own times.

<span id="ix.v-p2"></span>That our learned translators have
unaccountably admitted a very inaccurate translation of the crucial
paragraph in book iii. cap. iii. sect. 2, I have shown in the footnote
at that place. It is evident, (1) because they themselves are not
satisfied with it, and (2) because I have set it side by side with the
more literal rendering of a writer who would have preferred their
reading if it could have borne the test of criticism.

<span id="ix.v-p3"></span>Now, the authors of the Latin
translation <span id="fr_3793"></span>[3794](#fn_3793.md) may have designed
the ambiguity which gives the Ultramontane party an apparent advantage;
but it is an advantage which disappears as soon as it is examined, and
hence I am content to take it as it stands. Various conjectures have
been made as to the original Greek of Irenæus; but the Latin answers
every purpose of the author’s argument, and is fatal to the claims of
the Papacy. Let me recur to the translation given, *in loco*, from a
Roman Catholic, and this will be seen at once.

<span id="ix.v-p5"></span>For he thus renders it:—

<span id="ix.v-p6"></span>1. In this Church, “ever, *by those who are on
every side*, has been preserved that tradition <span id="page_461">p.
461</span> <span id="ix.v-Page_461"></span> which is from apostles.” How
would such a proposition have sounded to Pius IX. in the Vatican
Council? The faith is preserved *by those who come to Rome*, not by the
Bishop who presides there.

<span id="ix.v-p7"></span>2. “For to this Church, on account of more
potent principality, <span id="fr_3794"></span>[3795](#fn_3794.md) it is
necessary that *every Church* (that is, those who are, on every side,
faithful) resort.” The greatness of Rome, that is, as the capital of the
Empire, imparts to the local Church a superior dignity, even as compared
with Lyons, or any other metropolitical Church. Everybody visits Rome:
hence you find there faithful witnesses from every side (from all the
Churches); and *their united testimony* it is which preserves in Rome
the pure apostolic traditions.

<span id="ix.v-p9"></span>The Latin, thus translated by a candid Roman
Catholic, reverses the whole system of the Papacy. Pius IX. informed his
Bishops, at the late Council, that they were not called to bear their
testimony, but to hear his infallible decree; “reducing us,” said the
Archbishop of Paris, “to a council of sacristans.”

<span id="ix.v-p10"></span>Sustaining these views by a few footnotes, I
add (1) a literal rendering of my own, and then (2) a metaphrase of the
same, bringing out the argument from the crabbed obstructions of the
Latin text. This, then, is what Irenæus says: (a) “For it is necessary
for every Church (that is to say, the faithful from all parts) to meet
in this Church, on account of the superior magistracy; in which Church,
by those who are from all places, the tradition of the apostles has been
preserved.” Or, more freely rendered: (b) “On account of the chief
magistracy <span id="fr_3795"></span>[3796](#fn_3795.md) \[of the empire\],
the faithful from all parts, representing every Church, are obliged to
resort to Rome, and there to come together; so that \[it is the
distinction of this Church that\], in it, the tradition of the apostles
has been preserved by Christians gathered together out of all the
Churches.” Taking the entire argument of our author with the context,
then, it amounts to this: “We must ask, not for local, but universal,
testimony. Now, in every Church founded by the apostles has been handed
down their traditions; but, as it would be a tedious thing to collect
them all, let this suffice. Take that Church (nearest at hand, and which
is the only Apostolic Church of the West), the great and glorious Church
at Rome, which was there founded by the two apostles Peter and Paul. In
her have been preserved the traditions *of all the Churches*, because
everybody is forced to go to the seat of empire: and therefore, by these
representatives of the whole Catholic Church, the apostolic traditions
have been all collected in Rome: <span
id="fr_3796"></span>[3797](#fn_3796.md) and you have a synoptical view of
all Churches in what is there preserved.” Had the views of the modern
Papacy ever entered the head of Irenæus, what an absurdity would be this
whole argument. He would have said, “It is no matter what may be
gathered elsewhere; for the Bishop of Rome is the infallible oracle of
all Catholic truth, and you will always find it by his mouth.” It should
be noted that Orthodoxy was indeed preserved there, just so long as Rome
permitted other Churches to contribute their testimony on the principle
of Irenæus, and thus to make her the depository of all Catholic
tradition, as witnessed “by *all, everywhere*, and from the beginning.”
But all this is turned upside down by modern Romanism. No other Church
is to be heard or considered; but Rome takes all into her own power, and
may dictate to all Churches what they are to believe, however novel, or
contrary to the torrent of antiquity in the teachings of their own
founders and great doctors in all past time.

<span id="ix.v-p4"></span> One of the Antiochian Canons probably
reflects the current language of an earlier antiquity thus: <span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.v-p4.1"></span>διὰ τὸ ἐν τῇ μητροπόλει
πανταχόθεν συντρέχειν πάντας τοὺς τὰ πράγματα ἔχοντας</span>: and, if
so, this <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.v-p4.2"></span>συντρέχειν</span> gives the meaning of
*convenire*.

<span id="fn_3794"></span>[461:3795](0010793.htm#fr_3794.md) <span
id="ix.v-p7.1"></span>

<span id="ix.v-p8"></span> “*Its* more potent,” etc., is not a strict
rendering: “*the* more potent,” rather; which leaves the *principalitas*
to the city, not the Church.

<span id="fn_3795"></span>[461:3796](0010793.htm#fr_3795.md) <span
id="ix.v-p10.1"></span>

<span id="ix.v-p11"></span> Bishop Wordsworth inclines to the idea that
the original Greek was <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.v-p11.1"></span>ἱκανωτέραν ἀρχαιότητα</span>, thus conceding that
Irenæus was speaking of the *greater antiquity* of Rome as compared with
other (Western) Churches. Even so, he shows that the argument of Irenæus
is fatal to Roman pretensions, which admit of no such ideas as he
advances, and no such freedom as that of his dealings with Rome.

<span id="fn_3796"></span>[461:3797](0010793.htm#fr_3796.md) <span
id="ix.v-p11.2"></span>

<span id="ix.v-p12"></span> Nobody has more forcibly stated the argument
of Irenæus than the Abbé Guettée, in his exhaustive work on the Papacy.
I published a translation of this valuable historical epitome in New
York (Carleton), 1867; but it is out of print. The original may be had
in Paris (Fischbacher), No. 33 Rue de Seine.
