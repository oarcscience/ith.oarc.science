### <span id="iv.ii.xi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XI.—Expression of grief on account of Valens.

<span id="iv.ii.xi-p1"></span><span id="iv.ii.xi-p1.1"></span><span
id="iv.ii.xi-p1.2"></span>I am greatly grieved for Valens, who was once
a presbyter among you, because he so little understands the place that
was given him \[in the Church\]. <span id="iv.ii.xi-p1.3"></span><span
id="iv.ii.xi-p1.4"></span>I exhort you, therefore, that ye abstain from
covetousness, <span id="fr_396"></span>[397](#fn_396) and that ye be
chaste and truthful. <span id="iv.ii.xi-p2.2"></span>“Abstain from every
form of evil.” <span id="fr_397"></span>[398](#fn_397) For if a man
cannot govern himself in such matters, how shall he enjoin them on
others? If a man does not keep himself from covetousness, <span
id="fr_398"></span>[399](#fn_398) he shall be defiled by idolatry, and
shall be judged as one of the heathen. But who of us are ignorant of the
judgment of the Lord? “Do we not know that the saints shall judge the
world?” <span id="fr_399"></span>[400](#fn_399) as Paul teaches. <span
id="iv.ii.xi-p5.2"></span>But I have neither seen nor heard of any such
thing among you, in the midst of whom the blessed Paul laboured, and who
are commended <span id="fr_400"></span>[401](#fn_400) in the beginning
of his Epistle. For he boasts of you in all those Churches which alone
then knew the Lord; but we \[of Smyrna\] had not yet known Him. I am
deeply grieved, therefore, brethren, for him (Valens) and his wife; to
whom may the Lord grant true repentance! And be ye then moderate in
regard to this matter, and “do not count such as enemies,” <span
id="fr_401"></span>[402](#fn_401) but call them back as suffering and
straying members, that ye may save your whole body. For by so acting ye
shall edify yourselves. <span id="fr_402"></span>[403](#fn_402)

<span id="iv.ii.xi-p2"></span> Some think that *incontinence* on the
part of the Valens and his wife is referred to. \[For many reasons I am
glad the translators have preferred the reading <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.ii.xi-p2.1"></span>πλεονεξίας</span>. The
next word, *chaste*, sufficiently rebukes the example of Valens. For
once I venture not to coincide with Jacobson’s comment.\]
