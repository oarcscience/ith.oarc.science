### <span id="ii.ii.xxv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXV.—The phœnix an emblem of our resurrection.

<span id="ii.ii.xxv-p1"></span><span id="ii.ii.xxv-p1.1"></span>Let us
consider that wonderful sign \[of the resurrection\] which takes place
in Eastern lands, that is, in Arabia and the countries round about.
There is a certain bird which is called a phœnix. This is the only one
of its kind, and lives five hundred years. And when the time of its
dissolution draws near that it must die, it builds itself a nest of
frankincense, and myrrh, and other spices, into which, when the time is
fulfilled, it enters and dies. But as the flesh decays a certain kind of
worm is produced, which, being nourished by the juices of the dead bird,
brings forth feathers. Then, when it has acquired strength, it takes up
that nest in which are the bones of its parent, and bearing these it
passes from the land of Arabia into Egypt, to the city called
Heliopolis. And, in open day, flying in the sight of all men, it places
them on the altar of the sun, and having done this, hastens back to its
former abode. The priests then inspect the registers of the dates, and
find that it has returned exactly as the five hundredth year was
completed. <span id="fr_103"></span>[104](#fn_103.md)

mentioned by Herodotus (ii. 73) and by Pliny (*Nat. Hist.*, x. 2.) and
is used as above by Tertullian (*De Resurr.*, §13) and by others of the
Fathers.
