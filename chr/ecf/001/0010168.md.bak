<span id="v.iv.vi"></span>

### <span id="v.iv.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.—Abstain from the poison of heretics.

<span id="v.iv.vi-p1"></span><span id="v.iv.vi-p1.1"></span><span
id="v.iv.vi-p1.2"></span><span id="v.iv.vi-p1.3"></span><span
id="v.iv.vi-p1.4"></span>I therefore, yet not I, but the love of Jesus
Christ, entreat you that ye use Christian nourishment only, and abstain
from herbage of a different kind; I mean heresy. For those <span
id="fr_754"></span>[755](#fn_754.md) \[that are given to this\] mix <span
id="fr_755"></span>[756](#fn_755.md) up Jesus Christ with their own poison,
speaking things which are unworthy of credit, like those who administer
a deadly drug in sweet wine, which he who is ignorant of does
greedily <span id="fr_756"></span>[757](#fn_756.md) take, with a fatal
pleasure <span id="fr_757"></span>[758](#fn_757.md) leading to his own
death.

<span id="v.iv.vi-p6"></span><span id="v.iv.vi-p6.1"></span><span
id="v.iv.vi-p6.2"></span><span id="v.iv.vi-p6.3"></span>I therefore, yet
not I, out the love of Jesus Christ, “entreat you that ye all speak the
same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be
perfectly joined together in the same mind, and in the same
judgment.” <span id="fr_758"></span>[759](#fn_758.md) <span
id="v.iv.vi-p7.2"></span>For there are some vain talkers <span
id="fr_759"></span>[760](#fn_759.md) and deceivers, not Christians, but
Christ-betrayers, <span id="fr_760"></span>[761](#fn_760.md) bearing about
the name of Christ in deceit, and “corrupting the word” <span
id="fr_761"></span>[762](#fn_761.md) of the Gospel; while they intermix the
poison of their deceit with their persuasive talk, <span
id="fr_762"></span>[763](#fn_762.md) as if they mingled aconite with sweet
wine, that so he who drinks, being deceived in his taste by the very
great sweetness of the draught, may incautiously meet with his death.
One of the ancients gives us this advice, “Let no man be called good who
mixes good with evil.” <span id="fr_763"></span>[764](#fn_763.md) For they
speak of Christ, not that they may preach Christ, but that they may
reject Christ; and they speak <span id="fr_764"></span>[765](#fn_764.md) of
the law, not that they may establish the law, but that they may proclaim
things contrary to it. For they alienate Christ from the Father, and the
law from Christ. They also calumniate His being born of the Virgin; they
are ashamed of His cross; they deny His passion; and they do not believe
His resurrection. They introduce God as a Being unknown; they suppose
Christ to be unbegotten; and as to the Spirit, they do not admit that He
exists. Some of them say that the Son is a mere man, and that the
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are but the same person, and that the
creation is the work of God, not by Christ, but by some other strange
power.
