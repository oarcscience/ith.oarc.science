### <span id="viii.vii.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.—God desires not sacrifices, but righteousness.

<span id="viii.vii.iv-p1"></span><span id="viii.vii.iv-p1.1"></span>And
that God is not appeased by the libations and incense of evil-doers, but
awards vengeance in righteousness to each one, Philemon <span
id="fr_2603"></span>[2604](#fn_2603.md) again shall bear testimony to me:—

> <span id="viii.vii.iv-p2.1"></span>“If any one should dream, O
> Pamphilus,  
> By sacrifice of bulls or goats—nay, then,  
> By Jupiter—of any such like things;  
> Or by presenting gold or purple robes,  
> Or images of ivory and gems;  
> If thus he thinks he may propitiate God,  
> He errs, and shows himself a silly one.  
> But let him rather useful be, and good,  
> Committing neither theft nor lustful deeds,  
> Nor murder foul, for earthly riches’ sake.  
> Let him of no man covet wife or child,  
> His splendid house, his wide-spread property,  
> His maiden, or his slave born ill his house,  
> His horses, or his cattle, or his beeves,  
> Nay, covet not a pin, O Pamphilus,  
> For God, close by you, sees whate’er you do.  
> He ever with the wicked man is wroth,  
> But in the righteous takes a pleasure still,  
> Permitting him to reap fruit of his toil,  
> And to enjoy the bread his sweat has won.  
> But being righteous, see thou pay thy vows,  
> And unto God the giver offer gifts.  
> Place thy adorning not in outward shows,  
> But in an inward purity of heart;  
> Hearing the thunder then, thou shall not fear,  
> Nor shall thou flee, O master, at its voice,  
> For thou art conscious of no evil deed,  
> And God, close by you, sees whate’er you do.”  

<span id="viii.vii.iv-p3"></span>Again, Plato, in *Timæus*, <span
id="fr_2604"></span>[2605](#fn_2604.md) says: “But if any one on
consideration should actually institute <span id="page_292">p.
292</span> <span id="viii.vii.iv-Page_292"></span> a rigid inquiry, he
would be ignorant of the distinction between the human and the divine
nature; because God mingles many <span
id="fr_2605"></span>[2606](#fn_2605.md) things up into one, \[and again is
able to dissolve one into many things,\] seeing that He is endued with
knowledge and power; but no man either is, or ever shall be, able to
perform any of these.”

<span id="viii.vii.iv-p2"></span> Some attribute these lines to
Menander, others regard them as spurious.

<span id="fn_2604"></span>[291:2605](0010653.htm#fr_2604.md) <span
id="viii.vii.iv-p3.1"></span>

<span id="viii.vii.iv-p4"></span> P. 68, D, \[cap. 30.\]

<span id="fn_2605"></span>[292:2606](0010653.htm#fr_2605.md) <span
id="viii.vii.iv-p4.1"></span>

<span id="viii.vii.iv-p5"></span> The <span class="upper"><span
id="viii.vii.iv-p5.1"></span>mss.</span> are corrupt here. They seem to
read, and one actually does read, “all” for “many.” “Many” is in Plato,
and the clause in brackets is taken from Plato to fill up the sense.
