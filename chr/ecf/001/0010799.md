### <span id="ix.vi.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.—Answer to another objection, showing that the destruction of Jerusalem, which was the city of the great King, diminished nothing from the supreme majesty and power of God, for that this destruction was put in execution by the most wise counsel of the same God.

<span id="ix.vi.v-p1"></span>1. <span id="ix.vi.v-p1.1"></span><span
id="ix.vi.v-p1.2"></span>Further, also, concerning Jerusalem and the
Lord, they venture to assert that, if it had been “the city of the great
King,” <span id="fr_3832"></span>[3833](#fn_3832) it would not have been
deserted. <span id="fr_3833"></span>[3834](#fn_3833) This is just as if
any one should say, that if straw were a creation of God, it would never
part company with the wheat; and that the vine twigs, if made by God,
never would be lopped away and deprived of the clusters. But as these
\[vine twigs\] have not been originally made for their own sake, but for
that of the fruit growing upon them, which being come to maturity and
taken away, they are left behind, and those which do not conduce to
fructification are lopped off altogether; so also \[was it with\]
Jerusalem, which had in herself borne the yoke of bondage (under which
man was reduced, who in former times was not subject to God when death
was reigning, and being subdued, became a fit subject for liberty), when
the fruit of liberty had come, and reached maturity, and been reaped and
stored in the barn, and when those which had the power to produce fruit
had been carried away from her \[i.e., from Jerusalem\], and scattered
throughout all the world. Even as Esaias saith, “The children of <span
id="page_466">p. 466</span> <span id="ix.vi.v-Page_466"></span> Jacob
shall strike root, and Israel shall flourish, and the whole world shall
be filled with his fruit.” <span id="fr_3834"></span>[3835](#fn_3834)
The fruit, therefore, having been sown throughout all the world, she
(Jerusalem) was deservedly forsaken, and those things which had formerly
brought forth fruit abundantly were taken away; for from these,
according to the flesh, were Christ and the apostles enabled to bring
forth fruit. But now these are no longer useful for bringing forth
fruit. For all things which have a beginning in time must of course have
an end in time also.

<span id="ix.vi.v-p5"></span>2. Since, then, the law originated with
Moses, it terminated with John as a necessary consequence. Christ had
come to fulfil it: wherefore “the law and the prophets were” with them
“until John.” <span id="fr_3835"></span>[3836](#fn_3835) And therefore
Jerusalem, taking its commencement from David, <span
id="fr_3836"></span>[3837](#fn_3836) and fulfilling its own times, must
have an end of legislation <span id="fr_3837"></span>[3838](#fn_3837)
when the new covenant was revealed. For God does all things by measure
and in order; nothing is unmeasured with Him, because nothing is out of
order. Well spake he, who said that the unmeasurable Father was Himself
subjected to measure in the Son; for the Son is the measure of the
Father, since He also comprehends Him. But that the administration of
them (the Jews) was temporary, Esaias says: “And the daughter of Zion
shall be left as a cottage in a vineyard, and as a lodge in a garden of
cucumbers.” <span id="fr_3838"></span>[3839](#fn_3838) And when shall
these things be left behind? Is it not when the fruit shall be taken
away, and the leaves alone shall be left, which now have no power of
producing fruit?

<span id="ix.vi.v-p10"></span>3. But why do we speak of Jerusalem,
since, indeed, the fashion of the whole world must also pass away, when
the time of its disappearance has come, in order that the fruit indeed
may be gathered into the garner, but the chaff, left behind, may be
consumed by fire? “For the day of the Lord cometh as a burning furnace,
and all sinners shall be stubble, they who do evil things, and the day
shall burn them up.” <span id="fr_3839"></span>[3840](#fn_3839) Now, who
this Lord is that brings such a day about, John the Baptist points out,
when he says of Christ, “He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and
with fire, having His fan in His hand to cleanse His floor; and He will
gather His fruit into the garner, but the chaff He will burn up with
unquenchable fire.” <span id="fr_3840"></span>[3841](#fn_3840) For He
who makes the chaff and He who makes the wheat are not different
persons, but one and the same, who judges them, that is, separates them.
But the wheat and the chaff, being inanimate and irrational, have been
made such by nature. But man, being endowed with reason, and in this
respect like to God, having been made free in his will, and with power
over himself, is himself the cause to himself, that sometimes he becomes
wheat, and sometimes chaff. Wherefore also he shall be justly condemned,
because, having been created a rational being, he lost the true
rationality, and living irrationally, opposed the righteousness of God,
giving himself over to every earthly spirit, and serving all lusts; as
says the prophet, “Man, being in honour, did not understand: he was
assimilated to senseless beasts, and made like to them.” <span
