### <span id="v.iv.ix-p0.1"></span>Chapter IX.—Reference to the history of Christ.

<span id="v.iv.ix-p1"></span><span id="v.iv.ix-p1.1"></span><span
id="v.iv.ix-p1.2"></span>Stop your ears, therefore, when any one speaks
to you at variance with <span id="fr_786"></span>[787](#fn_786) <span
id="page_70">p. 70</span> <span id="v.iv.ix-Page_70"></span> Jesus
Christ, who was descended from David, and was also of Mary; who was
truly born, and did eat and drink. <span id="v.iv.ix-p2.1"></span>He was
truly persecuted under Pontius Pilate; He was truly crucified, and
\[truly\] died, in the sight of beings in heaven, and on earth, and
under the earth. <span id="v.iv.ix-p2.2"></span><span
id="v.iv.ix-p2.3"></span>He was also truly raised from the dead, His
Father quickening Him, even as after the same manner His Father will so
raise up us who believe in Him by Christ Jesus, apart from whom we do
not possess the true life.

<span id="v.iv.ix-p3"></span><span id="v.iv.ix-p3.1"></span><span
id="v.iv.ix-p3.2"></span>Stop your ears, therefore, when any one speaks
to you at variance with <span id="fr_787"></span>[788](#fn_787) Jesus
Christ, the Son of God, who was descended from David, and was also of
Mary; who was truly begotten of God and of the Virgin, but not after the
same manner. For indeed God and man are not the same. He truly assumed a
body; for “the Word was made flesh,” <span
id="fr_788"></span>[789](#fn_788) and lived upon earth without sin. For
says He, “Which of you convicteth me of sin?” <span
id="fr_789"></span>[790](#fn_789) He did in reality both eat and drink.
<span id="v.iv.ix-p6.2"></span>He was crucified and died under Pontius
Pilate. He really, and not merely in appearance, was crucified, and
died, in the sight of beings in heaven, and on earth, and under the
earth. By those in heaven I mean such as are possessed of incorporeal
natures; by those on earth, the Jews and Romans, and such persons as
were present at that time when the Lord was crucified; and by those
under the earth, the multitude that arose along with the Lord. For says
the Scripture, “Many bodies of the saints that slept arose,” <span
id="fr_790"></span>[791](#fn_790) their graves being opened. He
descended, indeed, into Hades alone, but He arose accompanied by a
multitude; and rent asunder that means <span
id="fr_791"></span>[792](#fn_791) of separation which had existed from
the beginning of the world, and cast down its partition-wall. <span
id="v.iv.ix-p8.1"></span><span id="v.iv.ix-p8.2"></span>He also rose
again in three days, the Father raising Him up; and after spending forty
days with the apostles, He was received up to the Father, and “sat down
at His right hand, expecting till His enemies are placed under His
feet.” <span id="fr_792"></span>[793](#fn_792) On the day of the
preparation, then, at the third hour, He received the sentence from
Pilate, the Father permitting that to happen; at the sixth hour He was
crucified; at the ninth hour He gave up the ghost; and before sunset He
was buried. <span id="fr_793"></span>[794](#fn_793) During the Sabbath
He continued under the earth in the tomb in which Joseph of Arimathæa
had laid Him. <span id="v.iv.ix-p10.1"></span>At the dawning of the
Lord’s day He arose from the dead, according to what was spoken by
Himself, “As Jonah was three days and three nights in the whale’s belly,
so shall the Son of man also be three days and three nights in the heart
of the earth.” <span id="fr_794"></span>[795](#fn_794) The day of the
preparation, then, comprises the passion; the Sabbath embraces the
burial; the Lord’s Day contains the resurrection.
