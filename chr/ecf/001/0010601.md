### <span id="viii.iv.cxl-p0.1"></span>Chapter CXL.—In Christ all are free. The Jews hope for salvation in vain because they are sons of Abraham.

<span id="viii.iv.cxl-p1"></span>“Hence also Jacob, as I remarked
before, being himself a type of Christ, had married the two handmaids of
his two free wives, and of them begat sons, for the purpose of
indicating beforehand that Christ would receive even all those who
amongst Japheth’s race are descendants of Canaan, equally with the free,
and would have the children fellow-heirs. And we are such; but you
cannot comprehend this, because you cannot drink of the living fountain
of God, but of broken cisterns which can hold no water, as the Scripture
says. <span id="fr_2481"></span>[2482](#fn_2481.md) But they are cisterns
broken, and holding no water, which your own teachers have digged, as
the Scripture also expressly asserts, ‘teaching for doctrines the
commandments of men.’ <span id="fr_2482"></span>[2483](#fn_2482.md) <span
id="viii.iv.cxl-p3.2"></span>And besides, they beguile themselves and
you, supposing that the everlasting kingdom will be assuredly given to
those of the dispersion who are of Abraham after the flesh, although
they be sinners, and faithless, and disobedient towards God, which the
Scriptures have proved is not the case. For if so, Isaiah would never
have said this: ‘And unless the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we
would have been like Sodom and Gomorrah.’ <span
id="fr_2483"></span>[2484](#fn_2483.md) And Ezekiel: ‘Even if Noah, and
Jacob, and Daniel were to pray for sons or daughters, their request
should not be granted.’ <span id="fr_2484"></span>[2485](#fn_2484.md) ‘But
neither shall the father perish for the son, nor the son for the father;
but every one for his own sin, and each shall be saved for his own
righteousness.’ <span id="fr_2485"></span>[2486](#fn_2485.md) And again
Isaiah says: ‘They shall look on the carcases <span
id="fr_2486"></span>[2487](#fn_2486.md) of them that have transgressed:
their worm shall not cease, and their fire shall not be quenched; and
they shall be a spectacle to all flesh.’ <span
id="fr_2487"></span>[2488](#fn_2487.md) And our Lord, according to the will
of Him that sent Him, who is the Father and Lord of all, would not have
said, ‘They shall come from the east, and from the west, and shall sit
down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven. But
the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer
darkness.’ <span id="fr_2488"></span>[2489](#fn_2488.md) Furthermore, I
have proved in what has preceded, <span
id="fr_2489"></span>[2490](#fn_2489.md) that those who were foreknown to be
unrighteous, whether men or angels, are not made wicked by God’s fault,
but each man by his own fault is what he will appear to be.
