### <span id="vi.ii.xvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVI.—The spiritual temple of God.

<span id="vi.ii.xvi-p1"></span><span id="vi.ii.xvi-p1.1"></span><span
id="vi.ii.xvi-p1.2"></span>Moreover, I will also tell you concerning the
temple, how the wretched \[Jews\], wandering in error, trusted not in
God Himself, but in the temple, as being the house of God. For almost
after the manner of the Gentiles they worshipped Him in the
temple. <span id="fr_1671"></span>[1672](#fn_1671.md) But learn how the
Lord speaks, when abolishing it: “Who hath meted out heaven with a span,
and the earth with his palm? Have not I?” <span
id="fr_1672"></span>[1673](#fn_1672.md) “Thus saith the Lord, Heaven is My
throne, and the earth My footstool: what kind of house will ye build to
Me, or what is the place of My rest?” <span
id="fr_1673"></span>[1674](#fn_1673.md) Ye perceive that their hope is
vain. Moreover, He again says, “Behold, they who have cast down this
temple, even they shall build it up again.” <span
id="fr_1674"></span>[1675](#fn_1674.md) It has so happened. <span
id="fr_1675"></span>[1676](#fn_1675.md) For through their going to war, it
was destroyed by their enemies; and now: they, as the servants of their
enemies, shall rebuild it. Again, it was revealed that the city and the
temple and the people of Israel were to be given up. <span
id="vi.ii.xvi-p6.1"></span><span id="vi.ii.xvi-p6.2"></span>For the
Scripture saith, “And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the
Lord will deliver up the sheep of His pasture, and their sheep-fold and
tower, to destruction.” <span id="fr_1676"></span>[1677](#fn_1676.md) And
it so happened as the Lord had spoken. <span
id="vi.ii.xvi-p7.3"></span>Let us inquire, then, if there still is a
temple of God. There is—where He himself declared He would make and
finish it. For it is written, “And it shall come to pass, when the week
is completed, the temple of God shall be built in glory in the name of
the Lord.” <span id="fr_1677"></span>[1678](#fn_1677.md) I find, therefore,
that a temple does exist. Learn, then, how it shall be built in the name
of the Lord. Before we believed in God, the habitation of our heart was
corrupt and weak, as being indeed like a temple made with hands. For it
was full of idolatry, and was a habitation of demons, through our doing
such things as were opposed to \[the will of\] God. But it shall be
built, observe ye, in the name of the Lord, in order that the temple of
the Lord may be built in glory. How? Learn \[as follows\]. Having
received the forgiveness of sins, and placed our trust in the name of
the Lord, we have become new creatures, formed again from the beginning.
Wherefore in our habitation God truly dwells in us. How? <span
id="vi.ii.xvi-p8.3"></span>His word of faith; His calling <span
id="fr_1678"></span>[1679](#fn_1678.md) of promise; the wisdom of the
statutes; the commands of the doctrine; He himself prophesying in us; He
himself dwelling in us; opening to us who were enslaved by death the
doors of the temple, that is, the mouth; and by giving us repentance
introduced us into the incorruptible temple. <span
id="fr_1679"></span>[1680](#fn_1679.md) He then, who wishes to be saved,
looks not to man, <span id="fr_1680"></span>[1681](#fn_1680.md) but to Him
who dwelleth in him, and speaketh in him, amazed at never having either
heard him utter such words with his mouth, nor himself having ever
desired to hear them. <span id="fr_1681"></span>[1682](#fn_1681.md) This is
the spiritual temple built for the Lord.
