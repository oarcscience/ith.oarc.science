### <span id="ix.vi.xxxii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXI.—We should not hastily impute as crimes to the men of old time those actions which the Scripture has not condemned, but should rather seek in them types of things to come: an example of this in the incest committed by Lot.

<span id="ix.vi.xxxii-p1"></span>1. <span class="upper"><span
id="ix.vi.xxxii-p1.1"></span>When</span> recounting certain matters of
this kind respecting them of old time, the presbyter \[before
mentioned\] was in the habit of instructing us, and saying: “With
respect to those misdeeds for which the Scriptures themselves blame the
patriarchs and prophets, we ought not to inveigh against them, nor
become like Ham, who ridiculed the shame of his father, and so fell
under a curse; but we should \[rather\] give thanks to God in their
behalf, inasmuch as their sins have been forgiven them through the
advent of our Lord; for He said that they gave thanks \[for us\], and
gloried in our salvation. <span id="fr_4228"></span>[4229](#fn_4228.md)
With respect to those actions, again, on which the Scriptures pass no
censure, but which are simply set down \[as having occurred\], we ought
not to become the accusers \[of those who committed them\], for we are
not more exact than God, nor can we be superior to our Master; but we
should search for a type \[in them\]. For not one of those things which
have been set down in Scripture without being condemned is without
significance.” <span id="ix.vi.xxxii-p2.2"></span><span
id="ix.vi.xxxii-p2.3"></span>An example is found in the case of Lot, who
led forth his daughters from Sodom, and these then conceived by their
own father; and who left behind him within the confines \[of the land\]
his wife, \[who remains\] a pillar of salt unto this day. For Lot, not
acting under the impulse of his own will, nor at the prompting of carnal
concupiscence, nor having any knowledge or thought of anything of the
kind, did \[in fact\] work out a type \[of future events\]. As says the
Scripture: “And that night the elder went in <span id="page_505">p.
505</span> <span id="ix.vi.xxxii-Page_505"></span> and lay with her
father; and Lot knew not when she lay down, nor when she arose.” <span
id="fr_4229"></span>[4230](#fn_4229.md) And the same thing took place in
the case of the younger: “And he knew not,” it is said, “when she slept
with him, nor when she arose.” <span
id="fr_4230"></span>[4231](#fn_4230.md) Since, therefore, Lot knew not
\[what he did\], nor was a slave to lust \[in his actions\], the
arrangement \[designed by God\] was carried out, by which the two
daughters (that is, the two churches <span
id="fr_4231"></span>[4232](#fn_4231) .md), who gave birth to children
begotten of one and the same father, were pointed out, apart from \[the
influence of\] the lust of the flesh. For there was no other person,
\[as they supposed\], who could impart to them quickening seed, and the
means of their giving birth to children, as it is written: “And the
elder said unto the younger, And there is not a man on the earth to
enter in unto us after the manner of all the earth: come, let us make
our father drunk with wine, and let us lie with him, and raise up seed
from our father.” <span id="fr_4232"></span>[4233](#fn_4232.md)

<span id="ix.vi.xxxii-p7"></span>2. Thus, after their simplicity and
innocence, did these daughters \[of Lot\] so speak, imagining that all
mankind had perished, even as the Sodomites had done, and that the anger
of God had come down upon the whole earth. Wherefore also they are to be
held excusable, since they supposed that they only, along with their
father, were left for the preservation of the human race; and for this
reason it was that they deceived their father. Moreover, by the words
they used this fact was pointed out—that there is no other one who can
confer upon the elder and younger church the \[power of\] giving birth
to children, besides our Father. Now the father of the human race is the
Word of God, as Moses points out when he says, “Is not He thy father who
hath obtained thee \[by generation\], and formed thee, and created
thee?” <span id="fr_4233"></span>[4234](#fn_4233.md) At what time, then,
did He pour out upon the human race the life-giving seed—that is, the
Spirit of the remission of sins, through means of whom we are quickened?
Was it not then, when He was eating with men, and drinking wine upon the
earth? For it is said, “The Son of man came eating and drinking;” <span
id="fr_4234"></span>[4235](#fn_4234.md) and when He had lain down, He fell
asleep, and took repose. As He does Himself say in David, “I slept, and
took repose.” <span id="fr_4235"></span>[4236](#fn_4235.md) And because He
used thus to act while He dwelt and lived among us, He says again, “And
my sleep became sweet unto me.” <span
id="fr_4236"></span>[4237](#fn_4236.md) Now this whole matter was indicated
through Lot, that the seed of the Father of all—that is, of the Spirit
of God, by whom all things were made—was commingled and united with
flesh— that is, with His own workmanship; by which commixture and unity
the two synagogues—that is, the two churches—produced from their own
father living sons to the living God.

<span id="ix.vi.xxxii-p12"></span>3. And while these things were taking
place, his wife remained in \[the territory of\] Sodore, no longer
corruptible flesh, but a pillar of salt which endures for ever; <span
id="fr_4237"></span>[4238](#fn_4237.md) and by those natural
processes <span id="fr_4238"></span>[4239](#fn_4238.md) which appertain to
the human race, indicating that the Church also, which is the salt of
the earth, <span id="fr_4239"></span>[4240](#fn_4239.md) has been left
behind within the confines of the earth, and subject to human
sufferings; and while entire members are often taken away from it, the
pillar of salt still endures, <span id="fr_4240"></span>[4241](#fn_4240.md)
thus typifying the foundation of the faith which maketh strong, and
sends forward, children to their Father.

entitled *Sodoma* preserved among the works of Tertullian and Cyprian

<span id="ix.vi.xxxii-p16"></span> The poem just referred to also says
in reference to this pillar:—

> <span id="ix.vi.xxxii-p16.1"></span>“Ipsaque imago sibi formam sine
> corpore servans  
> Durat adhuc, et enim nuda statione sub æthram  
> Nec pluviis dilapsa situ, nec diruta ventis.  
> Quin etiam si quis mutilaverit advena formam,  
> Protinus ex sese suggestu vulnera complet.”  

<span id="ix.vi.xxxii-p17"></span>\[That a pillar of salt is still to be
seen in this vicinity, is now confirmed by many modern travellers
(report of Lieut. Lynch, United States Navy), which accounts for the
natural inference of Josephus and others on whom our author relied. The
coincidence is noteworthy.\]
