### <span id="viii.ii.xxviii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXVIII.—God’s care for men.

<span id="viii.ii.xxviii-p1"></span><span
id="viii.ii.xxviii-p1.1"></span><span
id="viii.ii.xxviii-p1.2"></span>For among us the prince of the wicked
spirits is called the serpent, and Satan, and the devil, as you can
learn by looking into our writings. <span
id="viii.ii.xxviii-p1.3"></span>And that he would be sent into the fire
with his host, and the men who follow him, and would be punished for an
endless duration, Christ foretold. <span
id="viii.ii.xxviii-p1.4"></span>For the reason why God has delayed to do
this, is His regard for the human race. For He foreknows that some are
to be saved by repentance, some even that are perhaps not yet
born. <span id="fr_1822"></span>[1823](#fn_1822) In the beginning He
made the human race with the power of thought and of choosing the truth
and doing right, so that all men are without excuse before God; for they
have been born rational and contemplative. And if any one disbelieves
that God cares for these things, <span
id="fr_1823"></span>[1824](#fn_1823) he will thereby either insinuate
that God does not exist, or he will assert that though He exists He
delights in vice, or exists like a stone, and that neither virtue nor
vice are anything, but only in the opinion of men these things are
reckoned good or evil. And this is the greatest profanity and
wickedness.

<span id="viii.ii.xxviii-p2"></span> Literally, “For He foreknows some
about to be saved by repentance, and some not yet perhaps born.”

<span id="viii.ii.xxviii-p3"></span> Those things which concern the
salvation of man; so Trollope and the other interpreters, except Otto,
who reads <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.ii.xxviii-p3.1"></span>τούτων</span> masculine, and understands
it of the men first spoken of. \[See Plato (*De Legibus*, opp. ix. p.
98, Bipont., 1786), and the valuable edition of Book X. by Professor
Tayler Lewis (p. 52. etc.). New York, 1845.\]
