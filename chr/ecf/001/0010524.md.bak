<span id="viii.iv.lxiii"></span>

### <span id="viii.iv.lxiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter LXIII.—It is proved that this God was incarnate.

<span id="viii.iv.lxiii-p1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.lxiii-p1.1"></span><span id="viii.iv.lxiii-p1.2"></span>And
Trypho said, “This point has been proved to me forcibly, and by many
arguments, my friend. It remains, then, to prove that He submitted to
become man by the Virgin, according to the will of His Father; and to be
crucified, and to die. Prove also clearly, that after this He rose again
and ascended to heaven.”

<span id="viii.iv.lxiii-p2"></span>I answered, “This, too, has been
already demonstrated <span id="page_229">p. 229</span> <span
id="viii.iv.lxiii-Page_229"></span> by me in the previously quoted words
of the prophecies, my friends; which, by recalling and expounding for
your sakes, I shall endeavour to lead you to agree with me also about
this matter. The passage, then, which Isaiah records, ‘Who shall declare
His generation? for His life is taken away from the earth,’ <span
id="fr_2178"></span>[2179](#fn_2178.md) —does it not appear to you to refer
to One who, not having descent from men, was said to be delivered over
to death by God for the transgressions of the people?—of whose blood,
Moses (as I mentioned before), when speaking in parable, said, that He
would wash His garments in the blood of the grape; since His blood did
not spring from the seed of man, but from the will of God. <span
id="viii.iv.lxiii-p3.2"></span><span id="viii.iv.lxiii-p3.3"></span>And
then, what is said by David, ‘In the splendours of Thy holiness have I
begotten Thee from the womb, before the morning star. <span
id="fr_2179"></span>[2180](#fn_2179.md) The Lord hath sworn, and will not
repent, Thou art a priest for ever, after the order of Melchizedek,’
 <span id="fr_2180"></span>[2181](#fn_2180.md) —does this not declare to
you <span id="fr_2181"></span>[2182](#fn_2181.md) that \[He was\] from of
old, <span id="fr_2182"></span>[2183](#fn_2182.md) and that the God and
Father of all things intended Him to be begotten by a human womb? And
speaking in other words, which also have been already quoted, \[he
says\]: ‘Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of rectitude
is the sceptre of Thy kingdom. Thou hast loved righteousness, and hast
hated iniquity: therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed Thee with the
oil of gladness above Thy fellows. \[He hath anointed Thee\] with myrrh,
and oil, and cassia from Thy garments, from the ivory palaces, whereby
they made Thee glad. Kings’ daughters are in Thy honour. The queen stood
at Thy right hand, clad in garments embroidered with gold. <span
id="fr_2183"></span>[2184](#fn_2183.md) Hearken, O daughter, and behold,
and incline thine ear, and forget thy people and the house of thy
father; and the King shall desire thy beauty: because he is thy Lord,
and thou shalt worship Him.’ <span id="fr_2184"></span>[2185](#fn_2184.md)
Therefore these words testify explicitly that He is witnessed to by Him
who established these things, <span id="fr_2185"></span>[2186](#fn_2185.md)
as deserving to be worshipped, as God and as Christ. Moreover, that the
word of God speaks to those who believe in Him as being one soul, and
one synagogue, and one church, as to a daughter; that it thus addresses
the church which has sprung from His name and partakes of His name (for
we are all called Christians), is distinctly proclaimed in like manner
in the following words, which teach us also to forget \[our\] old
ancestral customs, when they speak thus: <span
id="fr_2186"></span>[2187](#fn_2186.md) ‘Hearken, O daughter, and behold,
and incline thine ear; forget thy people and the house of thy father,
and the King shall desire thy beauty: because He is thy Lord, and thou
shalt worship Him.’ ”
