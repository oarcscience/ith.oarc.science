### <span id="viii.iv.xcvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XCVI.—That curse was a prediction of the things which the Jews would do.

<span id="viii.iv.xcvi-p1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.xcvi-p1.1"></span><span id="viii.iv.xcvi-p1.2"></span><span
id="viii.iv.xcvi-p1.3"></span>“For the statement in the law, ‘Cursed is
every one that hangeth on a tree,’ <span
id="fr_2315"></span>[2316](#fn_2315) confirms our hope which depends on
the crucified Christ, not because He who has been crucified is cursed by
God, but because God foretold that which would be done by you all, and
by those like to you, who do not know <span
id="fr_2316"></span>[2317](#fn_2316) that this is He who existed before
all, who is the eternal Priest of God, and King, and Christ. And you
clearly see that this has come to pass. <span
id="viii.iv.xcvi-p3.3"></span><span id="viii.iv.xcvi-p3.4"></span>For
you curse in your synagogues all those who are called <span
id="fr_2317"></span>[2318](#fn_2317) from Him Christians; and other
nations effectively carry out the curse, putting to death those who
simply confess themselves to be Christians; to all of whom we say, You
are our brethren; rather recognise the truth of God. And while neither
they nor you are persuaded by us, but strive earnestly to cause us to
deny the name of Christ, we choose rather and submit to death, in the
full assurance that all the good which God has promised through Christ
He will reward us with. And in addition to all this we pray for you,
that Christ may have mercy upon you. For He taught us to pray for our
enemies also, saying, ‘Love your enemies; be kind and merciful, as your
heavenly Father is.’ <span id="fr_2318"></span>[2319](#fn_2318) For we
see that the Almighty God is kind and merciful, causing His sun to rise
on the unthankful and on the righteous, and sending rain on the holy and
on the wicked; all of whom He has taught us He will judge.
