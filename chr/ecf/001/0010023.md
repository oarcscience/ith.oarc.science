### <span id="ii.ii.xviii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.—David as an example of humility.

<span id="ii.ii.xviii-p1"></span><span
id="ii.ii.xviii-p1.1"></span><span id="ii.ii.xviii-p1.2"></span><span
id="ii.ii.xviii-p1.3"></span>But what shall we say concerning David, to
whom such testimony was borne, and of whom <span
id="fr_79"></span>[80](#fn_79.md) God said, “I have found a man after Mine
own heart, David the son of Jesse; and in everlasting mercy have I
anointed him?” <span id="fr_80"></span>[81](#fn_80.md) <span
id="ii.ii.xviii-p3.2"></span>Yet this very man saith to God, “Have mercy
on me, O Lord, according to Thy great mercy; and according to the
multitude of Thy compassions, blot out my transgression. Wash me still
more from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin. For I acknowledge
my iniquity, and my sin is ever before me. Against Thee only have I
sinned, and done that which was evil in Thy sight; that Thou mayest be
justified in Thy sayings, and mayest overcome when Thou <span
id="fr_81"></span>[82](#fn_81.md) art judged. For, behold, I was conceived
in transgressions, and in my sins did my mother conceive me. For,
behold, Thou hast loved truth; the secret and hidden things of wisdom
hast Thou shown me. Thou shalt sprinkle me with hyssop, and I shall be
cleansed; Thou shalt wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow. Thou
shalt make me to hear joy and gladness; my bones, which have been
humbled, shall exult. Turn away Thy face from my sins, and blot out all
mine iniquities. Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right
spirit within me. <span id="fr_82"></span>[83](#fn_82.md) Cast me not away
from Thy presence, and take not Thy Holy Spirit from me. Restore to me
the joy of Thy salvation, and establish me by Thy governing Spirit. I
will teach transgressors Thy ways, and the ungodly shall be converted
unto Thee. Deliver me from blood-guiltiness, <span
id="fr_83"></span>[84](#fn_83.md) O God, the God of my salvation: my tongue
shall exult in Thy righteousness. O Lord, Thou shalt open my mouth, and
my lips shall show forth Thy praise. For if Thou hadst desired
sacrifice, I would have given it; Thou wilt not delight in
burnt-offerings. The sacrifice \[acceptable\] to God is a bruised
spirit; a broken and a contrite heart God will not despise.” <span
id="fr_84"></span>[85](#fn_84.md)
