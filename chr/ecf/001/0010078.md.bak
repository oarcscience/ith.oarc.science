### <span id="iii.ii.xi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XI.—These things are worthy to be known and believed.

<span id="iii.ii.xi-p1"></span><span id="iii.ii.xi-p1.1"></span>I do not
speak of things strange to me, nor do I aim at anything inconsistent
with right reason; <span id="fr_318"></span>[319](#fn_318.md) but having
been a disciple of the Apostles, I am become a teacher of the Gentiles.
I minister the things delivered to me to those that are disciples worthy
of the truth. For who that is rightly taught and begotten by the
loving <span id="fr_319"></span>[320](#fn_319.md) Word, would not seek to
learn accurately the things which have been clearly shown by the Word to
His disciples, to whom the Word being manifested has revealed them,
speaking plainly \[to them\], not understood indeed by the unbelieving,
but conversing with the disciples, who, being esteemed faithful by Him,
acquired a knowledge of the mysteries of the Father? For which <span
id="fr_320"></span>[321](#fn_320.md) reason He sent the Word, that He might
be manifested to the world; and He, being despised by the people \[of
the Jews\], was, when preached by the Apostles, believed on by the
Gentiles. <span id="fr_321"></span>[322](#fn_321.md) This is He who was
from the beginning, who appeared as if new, and was found old, and yet
who is ever born afresh in the hearts of the saints. This is He who,
being from everlasting, is to-day called <span
id="fr_322"></span>[323](#fn_322.md) the Son; through whom the Church is
enriched, and grace, widely spread, increases in the saints, furnishing
understanding, revealing mysteries, announcing times, rejoicing over the
faithful, giving <span id="fr_323"></span>[324](#fn_323.md) to those that
seek, by whom the limits of faith are not broken through, nor the
boundaries set by the fathers passed over. Then the fear of the law is
chanted, and the grace of the prophets is known, and the faith of the
gospels is established, and the tradition of the Apostles is preserved,
and the grace of the Church exults; which grace if you grieve not, you
shall know those things which the Word teaches, by whom He wills, and
when He pleases. For whatever things we are moved to utter by the will
of the Word commanding us, we communicate to you with pains, and from a
love of the things that have been revealed to us.
