### <span id="viii.iv.lxxi-p0.1"></span>Chapter LXXI.—The Jews reject the interpretation of the LXX., from which, moreover, they have taken away some passages.

<span id="viii.iv.lxxi-p1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.lxxi-p1.1"></span><span id="viii.iv.lxxi-p1.2"></span>“But I
am far from putting reliance in your teachers, who refuse to admit that
the interpretation made by the seventy elders who were with Ptolemy
\[king\] of the Egyptians is a correct one; and they attempt to frame
another. And I wish you to observe, that they have altogether taken away
many Scriptures from the translations effected by those seventy elders
who were with Ptolemy, and by which this very man who was crucified is
proved to have been set forth expressly as God, and man, and as being
crucified, and as dying; but since I am aware that this is denied by all
of your nation, I do not address myself to these points, but I
proceed <span id="fr_2216"></span>[2217](#fn_2216.md) to carry on my
discussions by means of those passages which are still admitted by you.
For you assent to those which I have brought before your attention,
except that you contradict the statement, ‘Behold, the virgin shall
conceive,’ and say it ought to be read, ‘Behold, the young woman shall
conceive.’ And I promised to prove that the prophecy referred, not, as
you were taught, to Hezekiah, but to this Christ of mine: and now I
shall go to the proof.”

<span id="viii.iv.lxxi-p3"></span>Here Trypho remarked, “We ask you
first of all to tell us some of the Scriptures which you allege have
been completely cancelled.”
