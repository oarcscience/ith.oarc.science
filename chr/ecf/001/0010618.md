### <span id="viii.vi.viii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VIII.—Antiquity, inspiration, and harmony of Christian teachers.

<span id="viii.vi.viii-p1"></span><span
id="viii.vi.viii-p1.1"></span><span id="viii.vi.viii-p1.2"></span>Since
therefore it is impossible to learn anything true concerning religion
from your teachers, who by their mutual disagreement have furnished you
with sufficient proof of their own ignorance, I consider it reasonable
to recur to our progenitors, who both in point of time have by a great
way the precedence of your teachers, and who have taught us nothing from
their own private fancy, nor differed with one another, nor attempted to
overturn one another’s positions, but without wrangling and contention
received from God the knowledge which also they taught to us. For
neither by nature nor by human conception is it possible for men to know
things so great and divine, but by the gift which then descended from
above upon the holy men, who had no need of rhetorical art, <span
id="fr_2530"></span>[2531](#fn_2530) nor of uttering anything in a
contentious or quarrelsome manner, but to present themselves pure <span
id="fr_2531"></span>[2532](#fn_2531) to the energy of the Divine Spirit,
in order that the divine plectrum itself, descending from heaven, and
using righteous men as an instrument like a harp or lyre, might reveal
to us the knowledge of things divine and heavenly. Wherefore, as if with
one mouth and one tongue, they have in succession, and in harmony with
one another, taught us both concerning God, and the creation of the
world, and the formation of man, and concerning the immortality of the
human soul, and the judgment which is to be after this life, and
concerning all things which it is needful for us to know, and thus in
divers times and places have afforded us the divine instruction. <span

order of truths, such as are everywhere received by Christians, to be an
inestimable advantage.\]
