id="v.vi-p1.2"></span>*Ignatius, who is also called Theophorus, to the
Church of God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, which is at

the harmony of God, and rejoiceth unceasingly* <span
id="fr_880"></span>[881](#fn_880.md) *in the passion of our Lord, and is
filled with all mercy through his resurrection; which I salute in the
blood of Jesus Christ, who is our eternal and enduring joy, especially
if \[men\] are in unity with the bishop, the presbyters, and the
deacons, who have been appointed according to the mind of Jesus Christ,
whom He has established in security, after His own will, and by His Holy
Spirit.*

established His Church upon a rock, by a spiritual building, not made
with hands, against which the winds and the floods have beaten, yet have
not been able to overthrow it:* <span id="fr_882"></span>[883](#fn_882.md)
*yea, and may spiritual wickedness never be able to do so, but be
thoroughly weakened by the power of Jesus Christ our Lord.*
