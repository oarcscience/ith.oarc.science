### <span id="v.iv.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.—Honour the deacons, etc.

<span id="v.iv.iii-p1"></span>In like manner, let all reverence the
deacons as an appointment <span id="fr_736"></span>[737](#fn_736.md) of
Jesus Christ, and the bishop as Jesus Christ, who is the Son of the
Father, and the presbyters as the sanhedrim of God, and assembly of the
apostles. Apart from these, there is no Church. <span
id="fr_737"></span>[738](#fn_737.md) Concerning all this, I am persuaded
that ye are of the same opinion. For I have received the
manifestation <span id="fr_738"></span>[739](#fn_738.md) of your love, and
still have it with me, in your bishop, whose very appearance is highly
instructive, <span id="fr_739"></span>[740](#fn_739.md) and his meekness of
itself a power; whom I imagine even the ungodly must reverence, seeing
they are <span id="fr_740"></span>[741](#fn_740.md) also pleased that I do
not spare myself. But shall I, when permitted to write on this point,
reach such a height of self-esteem, that though being a condemned <span
id="fr_741"></span>[742](#fn_741.md) man, I should issue commands to you as
if I were an apostle?

<span id="v.iv.iii-p8"></span>And do ye reverence them as Christ Jesus,
of whose place they are the keepers, even as the bishop is the
representative of the Father of all things, and the presbyters are the
sanhedrim of God, and assembly <span id="fr_742"></span>[743](#fn_742.md)
of the apostles of Christ. Apart from these there is no elect Church, no
congregation of holy ones, no assembly of saints. I am persuaded that ye
also are of this opinion. For I have received the manifestation <span
id="fr_743"></span>[744](#fn_743.md) of your love, and still have it with
me, in your bishop, whose very appearance is highly instructive, and his
meekness of itself a power; whom I imagine even the ungodly must
reverence. Loving you as I do, I avoid writing in any severer strain to
you, that I may not seem harsh to any, or wanting \[in tenderness\]. I
am indeed bound for the sake of Christ, but I am not yet worthy of
Christ. But when I am perfected, perhaps I shall then become so. I do
not issue orders like an apostle.
