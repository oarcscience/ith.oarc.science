### <span id="ix.viii.xxxiv-p0.1"></span>XXXIV.

<span id="ix.viii.xxxiv-p1"></span><span
id="ix.viii.xxxiv-p1.1"></span>“And <span
id="fr_4853"></span>[4854](#fn_4853.md) dipped himself,” says \[the
Scripture\], “seven times in Jordan.” <span
id="fr_4854"></span>[4855](#fn_4854.md) It was not for nothing that Naaman
of old, when suffering from leprosy, was purified upon his being
baptized, but \[it served\] as an indication to us. For as we are lepers
in sin, we are made clean, by means of the sacred water and the
invocation of the Lord, from our old transgressions; being spiritually
regenerated as new-born babes, even as the Lord has declared: “Except a
man be born again through water and the Spirit, he shall not enter into
the kingdom of heaven.” <span id="fr_4855"></span>[4856](#fn_4855.md)
