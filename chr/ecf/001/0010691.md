### <span id="viii.xi.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.—Examination of Chariton and others.

<span id="viii.xi.iii-p1"></span><span id="viii.xi.iii-p1.1"></span>Then
said the prefect Rusticus to Chariton, “Tell me further, Chariton, are
you also a Christian?” Chariton said, “I am a Christian by the command
of God.” Rusticus the prefect asked the woman Charito, “What say you,
Charito?” Charito said, “I am a Christian by the grace of God.” Rusticus
said to Euelpistus, “And what are you?” Euelpistus, a servant of Cæsar,
answered, “I too am a Christian, having been freed by Christ; and by the
grace of Christ I partake of the same hope.” Rusticus the prefect said
to Hierax, “And you, are you a Christian?” Hierax said, “Yes, I am a
Christian, for I revere and worship the same God.” Rusticus the prefect
<span id="page_306">p. 306</span> <span
id="viii.xi.iii-Page_306"></span> said, “Did Justin make you
Christians?” Hierax said, “I was a Christian, and will be a Christian.”
And Pæon stood up and said, “I too am a Christian.” Rusticus the prefect
said, “Who taught you?” Pæon said, “From our parents we received this
good confession.” Euelpistus said, “I willingly heard the words of
Justin. But from my parents also I learned to be a Christian.” Rusticus
the prefect said, “Where are your parents?” Euelpistus said, “In
Cappadocia.” Rusticus says to Hierax, “Where are your parents?” And he
answered, and said, “Christ is our true father, and faith in Him is our
mother; and my earthly parents died; and I, when I was driven from
Iconium in Phrygia, came here.” Rusticus the prefect said to Liberianus,
“And what say you? Are you a Christian, and unwilling to worship \[the
gods\]?” Liberianus said, “I too am a Christian, for I worship and
reverence the only true God.”
