<span id="ix.viii.liii-p1"></span><span
id="ix.viii.liii-p1.1"></span>With <span
id="fr_4910"></span>[4911](#fn_4910.md) regard to Christ, the law and the
prophets and the evangelists have proclaimed that He was born of a
virgin, that He suffered upon a beam of wood, and that He appeared from
the dead; that He also ascended to the heavens, and was glorified by the
Father, and is the Eternal King; that He is the perfect Intelligence,
the Word of God, who was begotten before the light; that He was the
Founder of the universe, along with it (light), and the Maker of man;
that He is All in all: Patriarch among the patriarchs; Law in the laws;
Chief Priest among priests; Ruler among kings; the Prophet among
prophets; the Angel among angels; the Man among men; Son in the Father;
God in God; King to all eternity. For it is He who sailed \[in the ark\]
along with Noah, and who guided Abraham; who was bound along with Isaac,
and was a Wanderer with Jacob; the Shepherd of those who are saved, and
the Bridegroom of the Church; the Chief also of the cherubim, the Prince
of the angelic powers; God of God; Son of the Father; Jesus Christ; King
for ever and ever. Amen.
