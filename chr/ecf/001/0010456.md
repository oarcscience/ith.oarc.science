### <span id="viii.iii.xi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XI.—How Christians view death.

<span id="viii.iii.xi-p1"></span><span id="viii.iii.xi-p1.1"></span>But
neither should we be put to death, nor would wicked men and devils be
more powerful than we, were not death a debt due by every man that is
born. Wherefore we give thanks when we pay this debt. <span
id="viii.iii.xi-p1.2"></span><span id="viii.iii.xi-p1.3"></span>And we
judge it right and opportune to tell here, for the sake of Crescens and
those who rave as he does, what is related by Xenophon. <span
id="viii.iii.xi-p1.4"></span>Hercules, says Xenophon, coming to a place
where three ways met, found Virtue and Vice, who appeared to him in the
form of women: Vice, in a luxurious dress, and with a seductive
expression rendered blooming by such ornaments, and her eyes of a
quickly melting tenderness, <span id="fr_1939"></span>[1940](#fn_1939.md)
said to Hercules that if he would follow her, she would always enable
him to pass his life in pleasure and adorned with the most graceful
ornaments, such as were then upon her own person; and Virtue, who was of
squalid look and dress, said, But if you obey me, you shall adorn
yourself not with ornament nor beauty that passes away and perishes, but
with everlasting and precious graces. And we are persuaded that every
one who flees those things that seem to be good, and follows hard after
what are reckoned difficult and strange, enters into blessedness. For
Vice, when by imitation of what is incorruptible (for what is really
incorruptible she neither has nor can produce) she has thrown around her
own actions, as a disguise, the properties of virtue, and qualities
which are really excellent, leads captive earthly-minded men, attaching
to Virtue her own evil properties. But those who understood the
excellences which belong to that which is real, are also uncorrupt in
virtue. And this every sensible person ought to think both of Christians
and of the athletes, and of those who did what the poets relate of the
so-called gods, concluding as much from our contempt of death, even when
it could be escaped. <span id="fr_1940"></span>[1941](#fn_1940.md)

<span id="viii.iii.xi-p2"></span> Another reading is <span

referring to the eyes of the beholder; and which may be rendered,
“speedily fascinating to the sight.”
