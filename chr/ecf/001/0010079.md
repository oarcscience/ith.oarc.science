### <span id="iii.ii.xii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XII.—The importance of knowledge to true spiritual life.

<span id="iii.ii.xii-p1"></span><span id="iii.ii.xii-p1.1"></span><span
id="iii.ii.xii-p1.2"></span><span id="iii.ii.xii-p1.3"></span><span
id="iii.ii.xii-p1.4"></span>When you have read and carefully listened to
these things, you shall know what God bestows on such as rightly love
Him, being made \[as ye are\] a paradise of delight, presenting <span
id="fr_324"></span>[325](#fn_324.md) in yourselves a tree bearing all kinds
of produce and flourishing well, being adorned with various fruits. For
in this place <span id="fr_325"></span>[326](#fn_325.md) the tree of
knowledge and the tree of life have been planted; but it is not the tree
of knowledge that destroys— it <span id="page_30">p. 30</span> <span
id="iii.ii.xii-Page_30"></span> is disobedience that proves destructive.
<span id="iii.ii.xii-p3.1"></span>Nor truly are those words without
significance which are written, how God from the beginning planted the
tree of life in the midst of paradise, revealing through knowledge the
way to life, <span id="fr_326"></span>[327](#fn_326.md) and when those who
were first formed did not use this \[knowledge\] properly, they were,
through the fraud of the Serpent, stripped naked. <span
id="fr_327"></span>[328](#fn_327.md) For neither can life exist without
knowledge, nor is knowledge secure without life. Wherefore both were
planted close together. The Apostle, perceiving the force \[of this
conjunction\], and blaming that knowledge which, without true doctrine,
is admitted to influence life, <span id="fr_328"></span>[329](#fn_328.md)
declares, “Knowledge puffeth up, but love edifieth.” For he who thinks
he knows anything without true knowledge, and such as is witnessed to by
life, knows nothing, but is deceived by the Serpent, as not <span
id="fr_329"></span>[330](#fn_329.md) loving life. But he who combines
knowledge with fear, and seeks after life, plants in hope, looking for
fruit. Let your heart be your wisdom; and let your life be true
knowledge <span id="fr_330"></span>[331](#fn_330.md) inwardly received.
Bearing this tree and displaying its fruit, thou shalt always
gather <span id="fr_331"></span>[332](#fn_331.md) in those things which are
desired by God, which the Serpent cannot reach, and to which deception
does not approach; nor is Eve then corrupted, <span
id="fr_332"></span>[333](#fn_332.md) but is trusted as a virgin; and
salvation is manifested, and the Apostles are filled with understanding,
and the Passover <span id="fr_333"></span>[334](#fn_333.md) of the Lord
advances, and the choirs <span id="fr_334"></span>[335](#fn_334.md) are
gathered together, and are arranged in proper order, and the Word
rejoices in teaching the saints,—<span id="iii.ii.xii-p12.4"></span>by
whom the Father is glorified: to whom be glory for ever. Amen. <span
id="fr_335"></span>[336](#fn_335.md)

<span id="iii.ii.xii-p5"></span> Or, “deprived of it.”

<span id="fn_328"></span>[30:329](0010079.htm#fr_328.md) <span
id="iii.ii.xii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ii.xii-p6"></span> Literally, “knowledge without the truth
of a command exercised to life.” See [1 Cor. viii.

<span id="fn_329"></span>[30:330](0010079.htm#fr_329.md) <span
id="iii.ii.xii-p6.2"></span>

<span id="iii.ii.xii-p7"></span> The <span class="upper"><span
id="iii.ii.xii-p7.1"></span>ms.</span> is here defective. Some read, “on
account of the love of life.”

id="iii.ii.xii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ii.xii-p10"></span> The meaning seems to be, that if the
tree of true knowledge and life be planted within you, you shall
continue free from blemishes and sins.

<span id="fn_333"></span>[30:334](0010079.htm#fr_333.md) <span
id="iii.ii.xii-p10.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ii.xii-p11"></span> \[This looks like a reference to the
Apocalypse, [Rev. v. 9](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#009.md)<span
id="iii.ii.xii-p11.1"></span>., [Rev. xix.
7](../../../bib/kjv/rev019.htm#007.md)<span id="iii.ii.xii-p11.2"></span>.,

<span id="fn_334"></span>[30:335](0010079.htm#fr_334.md) <span
id="iii.ii.xii-p11.4"></span>

<span id="iii.ii.xii-p12"></span> Here Bishop Wordsworth would read

cites [1 Pet. v. 3](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#003.md)<span
id="iii.ii.xii-p12.2"></span>, and refers to Suicer (Lexicon) in voce
<span class="Greek"><span id="iii.ii.xii-p12.3"></span>κλῆρος</span>.\]

<span id="fn_335"></span>[30:336](0010079.htm#fr_335.md) <span
