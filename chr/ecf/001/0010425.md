### <span id="viii.ii.lii-p0.1"></span>Chapter LII.—Certain fulfilment of prophecy.

<span id="viii.ii.lii-p1"></span><span
id="viii.ii.lii-p1.1"></span>Since, then, we prove that all things which
have already happened had been predicted by the prophets before they
came to pass, we must necessarily believe also that those things which
are in like manner predicted, but are yet to come to pass, shall
certainly happen. For as the things which have already taken place came
to pass when foretold, and even though unknown, so shall the things that
remain, even though they be unknown and disbelieved, yet come to pass.
For the prophets have proclaimed two advents of His: the one, that which
is already past, when He came as a dishonoured and suffering Man; but
the second, when, according to prophecy, He shall come from heaven with
glory, accompanied by His angelic host, when also He shall raise the
bodies of all men who have lived, and shall clothe those of the worthy
with immortality, and shall send those of the wicked, endued with
eternal sensibility, into everlasting fire with the wicked devils. And
that these things also have been foretold as yet to be, we will prove.
By Ezekiel the prophet it was said: “Joint shall be joined to joint, and
bone to bone, and flesh shall grow again; and every knee shall bow to
the Lord, and every tongue shall confess Him.” <span
id="fr_1875"></span>[1876](#fn_1875.md) And in what kind of sensation and
punishment the wicked are to be, hear from what was said in like manner
with reference to this; it is as follows: “Their worm shall not rest,
and their fire shall not be quenched;” <span
id="fr_1876"></span>[1877](#fn_1876.md) and then shall they repent, when it
profits them not. And what the people of the Jews shall say and do, when
they see Him coming in glory, has been thus predicted by Zechariah the
prophet: “I will command the four winds to gather the scattered
children; I will command the north wind to bring them, and the south
wind, that it keep not back. And then in Jerusalem there shall be great
lamentation, not the lamentation of mouths or of lips, but the
lamentation of the heart; and they shall rend not their garments, but
their hearts. Tribe by tribe they shall mourn, and then they shall look
on Him whom they have pierced; and they shall say, Why, O Lord, hast
Thou made us to err from Thy way? The glory which our fathers blessed,
has for us been turned into shame.” <span
id="fr_1877"></span>[1878](#fn_1877.md)
