<span id="viii.ix.xix-p1"></span>\[The words\] of St. Justin,
philosopher and martyr, from the fifth part of his *Apology:* <span
id="fr_2640"></span>[2641](#fn_2640) —I reckon prosperity, O men, to
consist in nothing else than in living according to truth. But we do not
live properly, or according to truth, unless we understand the nature of
things.

<span id="viii.ix.xix-p3"></span>It escapes them apparently, that he who
has by a true faith come forth from error to the truth, has truly known
himself, not, as they say, as being in a state of frenzy, but as free
from the unstable and (as to every variety of error) changeable
corruption, by the simple and ever identical truth.—*From the writings
of* <span class="upper"><span id="viii.ix.xix-p3.1"></span>John of
Damascus</span>.

<span id="viii.ix.xix-p2"></span> It is doubtful if these words are
really Justin’s, or, if so, from which, or what part, of his *Apologies*
they are derived.
