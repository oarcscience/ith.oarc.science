### <span id="ii.ii.xxxix-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXIX.—There is no reason for self-conceit.

<span id="ii.ii.xxxix-p1"></span><span
id="ii.ii.xxxix-p1.1"></span><span id="ii.ii.xxxix-p1.2"></span><span
id="ii.ii.xxxix-p1.3"></span>Foolish and inconsiderate men, who have
neither wisdom <span id="fr_169"></span>[170](#fn_169) nor instruction,
mock and deride us, being eager to exalt themselves in their own
conceits. For what can a mortal man do? or what strength is there in one
made out of the dust? For it is written, “There was no shape before mine
eyes, only I heard a sound, <span id="fr_170"></span>[171](#fn_170) and
a voice \[saying\], What then? Shall a man be pure before the Lord? or
shall such an one be \[counted\] blameless in his deeds, seeing He does
not confide in His servants, and has charged <span
id="fr_171"></span>[172](#fn_171) even His angels with perversity? The
heaven is not clean in His sight: how much less they that dwell in
houses of clay, of which also we ourselves were made! He smote them as a
moth; and from morning even until evening they endure not. Because they
could furnish no assistance to themselves, they perished. He breathed
upon them, and they died, because they had no wisdom. But call now, if
any one will answer thee, or if thou wilt look to any of the holy
angels; for wrath destroys the foolish man, and envy killeth him that is
in error. I have seen the foolish taking root, but their habitation was
presently consumed. Let their sons be far from safety; let them be
despised <span id="fr_172"></span>[173](#fn_172) before the gates of
those less than themselves, and there shall be none to deliver. For what
was prepared for them, the righteous shall eat; and they shall not be
delivered from evil.” <span id="fr_173"></span>[174](#fn_173)
