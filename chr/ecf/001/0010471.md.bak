### <span id="viii.iv.x-p0.1"></span>Chapter X.—Trypho blames the Christians for this alone—the non-observance of the law.

<span id="viii.iv.x-p1"></span><span id="viii.iv.x-p1.1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.x-p1.2"></span><span id="viii.iv.x-p1.3"></span>And when
they ceased, I again addressed them thus:—

<span id="viii.iv.x-p2"></span>“Is there any other matter, my friends,
in which we are blamed, than this, that we live not after the law, and
are not circumcised in the flesh as your forefathers were, and do not
observe sabbaths as you do? Are our lives and customs also slandered
among you? And I ask this: have you also believed concerning us, that we
eat men; and that after the feast, having extinguished the lights, we
engage in promiscuous concubinage? Or do you condemn us in this alone,
that we adhere to such tenets, and believe in an opinion, untrue, as you
think?”

<span id="viii.iv.x-p3"></span>“This is what we are amazed at,” said
Trypho, “but those things about which the multitude speak are not worthy
of belief; for they are most repugnant to human nature. Moreover, I am
aware that your precepts in the so-called Gospel are so wonderful and so
great, that I suspect no one can keep them; for I have carefully read
them. But this is what we are most at a loss about: that you, professing
to be pious, and supposing yourselves better than others, are not in any
particular separated from them, and do not alter your mode of living
from the nations, in that you observe no festivals or sabbaths, and do
not have the rite of circumcision; and further, resting your hopes on a
man that was crucified, you yet expect to obtain some good thing from
God, while you do not obey His commandments. Have you not read, that
that soul shall be cut off from his people who shall not have been
circumcised on the eighth day? And this has been ordained for strangers
and for slaves equally. But you, despising this covenant rashly, reject
the consequent duties, and attempt to persuade yourselves that you know
God, when, however, you perform none of those things which they do who
fear God. If, therefore, you can defend yourself on these points, and
make it manifest in what way you hope for anything whatsoever, even
though you do not observe the law, this we would very gladly hear from
you, and we shall make other similar investigations.”
