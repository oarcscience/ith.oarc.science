### <span id="viii.vii.i-p0.1"></span>Chapter I.—Object of the author.

class="upper"><span id="viii.vii.i-p1.4"></span>Although</span> human
nature at first received a union of intelligence and safety to discern
the truth, and the worship due to the one Lord of all, yet envy,
insinuating the excellence of human greatness, turned men away to the
making of idols; and this superstitious custom, after continuing for a
long period, is handed down to the majority as if it were natural and
true. It is the part of a lover of man, or rather of a lover of God, to
remind men who have neglected it of that which they ought to know. For
the truth is of itself sufficient to show forth, by means of those
things which are contained under the pole of heaven, the order
\[instituted by\] Him who has created them. But forgetfulness having
taken possession of the minds of men, through the long-suffering of God,
has acted recklessly in transferring to mortals the name which is
applicable to the only true God; and from the few the infection of sin
spread to the many, who were blinded by popular usage to the knowledge
of that which was lasting and unchangeable. For the men of former
generations, who instituted private and public rites in honour of such
as were more powerful, caused forgetfulness of the Catholic <span
id="fr_2594"></span>[2595](#fn_2594.md) faith to take possession of their
posterity; but I, as I have just stated, along with a God-loving mind,
shall employ the speech of one who loves man, and set it before those
who have intelligence, which all ought to have who are privileged to
observe the administration of the universe, so that they should worship
unchangeably Him who knows all things. This I shall do, not by mere
display of words, but by altogether using demonstration drawn from the
old poetry in Greek literature, <span
id="fr_2595"></span>[2596](#fn_2595.md) and from writings very common
amongst all. For from these the famous men who have handed down
idol-worship as law to the multitudes, shall be taught and convicted by
their own poets and literature of great ignorance.
