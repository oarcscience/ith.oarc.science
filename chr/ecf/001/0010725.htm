<p> <a name="ix.ii.xxix"></A>  <h3 align="center" align="center"><a name="ix.ii.xxix-p0.1"></A>Chapter XXVIII.&#8212;Doctrines of Tatian, the Encratites, and others.</h3>  
<p><a name="ix.ii.xxix-p1"></A>1. Many offshoots of numerous heresies have already been formed from those heretics we have described. This arises from the fact that numbers of them&#8212;indeed, we may say all&#8212;desire themselves to be teachers, and to break off from the particular heresy in which they have been involved. Forming one set of doctrines out of a totally different system of opinions, and then again others from others, they insist upon teaching something new, declaring themselves the inventors of any sort of opinion which they may have been able to call into existence. <a name="ix.ii.xxix-p1.1"></A>To give an example: Springing from Saturninus and Marcion, those who are called Encratites (self-controlled) preached against marriage, thus setting aside the original creation of God, and indirectly blaming Him who made the male and female for the propagation of the human race. Some of those reckoned among them have also introduced abstinence from animal food, thus proving themselves ungrateful to God, who formed all things. They deny, too, the salvation of him who was first created. It is but lately, however, that this opinion has been invented among them. <a name="ix.ii.xxix-p1.2"></A>A certain man named Tatian first introduced the blasphemy. He was a hearer of Justin&#146;s, and as long as he continued with him he expressed no such views; but after his martyrdom he separated from the Church, and, excited and puffed up by the thought of being a teacher, as if he were superior to others, he composed his own peculiar type of doctrine. He invented a system of certain invisible &AElig;ons, like the followers of Valentinus; while, like Marcion and Saturninus, he declared that marriage was nothing else than corruption and fornication.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2961"></A><A HREF="#fn_2961"><FONT SIZE="1">2962</FONT></A>
 But his denial of Adam&#146;s salvation was an opinion due entirely to himself.</p>  
<p><a name="ix.ii.xxix-p3"></A>2. Others, again, following upon Basilides and Carpocrates, have introduced promiscuous intercourse and a plurality of wives, and are indifferent about eating meats sacrificed to idols, maintaining that God does not greatly regard such matters. But why continue? For it is an impracticable attempt to mention all those who, in one way or another, have fallen away from the truth.</p>
