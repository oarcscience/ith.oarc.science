### <span id="viii.iv.xix-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIX.—Circumcision unknown before Abraham. The law was given by Moses on account of the hardness of their hearts.

<span id="viii.iv.xix-p1"></span>“It is this about which we are at a
loss, and with reason, because, while you endure such things, you do not
observe all the other customs which we are now discussing.”

<span id="viii.iv.xix-p2"></span><span
id="viii.iv.xix-p2.1"></span><span id="viii.iv.xix-p2.2"></span>“This
circumcision is not, however, necessary for all men, but for you alone,
in order that, as I have already said, you may suffer these things which
you now justly suffer. Nor do we receive that useless baptism of
cisterns, for it has nothing to do with this baptism of life. Wherefore
also God has announced that you have forsaken Him, the living fountain,
and digged for yourselves broken cisterns which can hold no water. Even
you, who are the circumcised according to the flesh, have need of our
circumcision; but we, having the latter, do not require the former. For
if it were necessary, as you suppose, God <span id="page_204">p.
204</span> <span id="viii.iv.xix-Page_204"></span> would not have made
Adam uncircumcised; would not have had respect to the gifts of Abel
when, being uncircumcised, he offered sacrifice and would not have been
pleased with the uncircumcision of Enoch, who was not found, because God
had translated him. Lot, being uncircumcised, was saved from Sodom, the
angels themselves and the Lord sending him out. Noah was the beginning
of our race; yet, uncircumcised, along with his children he went into
the ark. Melchizedek, the priest of the Most High, was uncircumcised; to
whom also Abraham the first who received circumcision after the flesh,
gave tithes, and he blessed him: after whose order God declared, by the
mouth of David, that He would establish the everlasting priest.
Therefore to you alone this circumcision was necessary, in order that
the people may be no people, and the nation no nation; as also
Hosea, <span id="fr_1990"></span>[1991](#fn_1990.md) one of the twelve
prophets, declares. Moreover, all those righteous men already mentioned,
though they kept no Sabbaths, <span id="fr_1991"></span>[1992](#fn_1991.md)
were pleasing to God; and after them Abraham with all his descendants
until Moses, under whom your nation appeared unrighteous and ungrateful
to God, making a calf in the wilderness: wherefore God, accommodating
Himself to that nation, enjoined them also to offer sacrifices, as if to
His name, in order that you might not serve idols. Which precept,
however, you have not observed; nay, you sacrificed your children to
demons. And you were commanded to keep Sabbaths, that you might retain
the memorial of God. For His word makes this announcement, saying, ‘That
ye may know that I am God who redeemed you.’ <span
