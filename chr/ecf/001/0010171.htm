  <A NAME="page_70"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 70</FONT></A> <a name="v.iv.ix-Page_70"></A>  Jesus Christ, who was descended from David, and was also of Mary; who was truly born, and did eat and drink. <a name="v.iv.ix-p2.1"></A>He was truly persecuted under Pontius Pilate; He was truly crucified, and [truly] died, in the sight of beings in heaven, and on earth, and under the earth. <a name="v.iv.ix-p2.2"></A><a name="v.iv.ix-p2.3"></A>He was also truly raised from the dead, His Father quickening Him, even as after the same manner His Father will so raise up us who believe in Him by Christ Jesus, apart from whom we do not possess the true life.</p>  
<p><a name="v.iv.ix-p3"></A><a name="v.iv.ix-p3.1"></A><a name="v.iv.ix-p3.2"></A>Stop your ears, therefore, when any one speaks to you at variance with&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_787"></A><A HREF="#fn_787"><FONT SIZE="1">788</FONT></A>
 Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who was descended from David, and was also of Mary; who was truly begotten of God and of the Virgin, but not after the same manner. For indeed God and man are not the same. He truly assumed a body; for &#8220;the Word was made flesh,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_788"></A><A HREF="#fn_788"><FONT SIZE="1">789</FONT></A>
 and lived upon earth without sin. For says He, &#8220;Which of you convicteth me of sin?&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_789"></A><A HREF="#fn_789"><FONT SIZE="1">790</FONT></A>
 He did in reality both eat and drink. <a name="v.iv.ix-p6.2"></A>He was crucified and died under Pontius Pilate. He really, and not merely in appearance, was crucified, and died, in the sight of beings in heaven, and on earth, and under the earth. By those in heaven I mean such as are possessed of incorporeal natures; by those on earth, the Jews and Romans, and such persons as were present at that time when the Lord was crucified; and by those under the earth, the multitude that arose along with the Lord. For says the Scripture, &#8220;Many bodies of the saints that slept arose,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_790"></A><A HREF="#fn_790"><FONT SIZE="1">791</FONT></A>
 their graves being opened. He descended, indeed, into Hades alone, but He arose accompanied by a multitude; and rent asunder that means&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_791"></A><A HREF="#fn_791"><FONT SIZE="1">792</FONT></A>
 of separation which had existed from the beginning of the world, and cast down its partition-wall. <a name="v.iv.ix-p8.1"></A><a name="v.iv.ix-p8.2"></A>He also rose again in three days, the Father raising Him up; and after spending forty days with the apostles, He was received up to the Father, and &#8220;sat down at His right hand, expecting till His enemies are placed under His feet.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_792"></A><A HREF="#fn_792"><FONT SIZE="1">793</FONT></A>
 On the day of the preparation, then, at the third hour, He received the sentence from Pilate, the Father permitting that to happen; at the sixth hour He was crucified; at the ninth hour He gave up the ghost; and before sunset He was buried.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_793"></A><A HREF="#fn_793"><FONT SIZE="1">794</FONT></A>
 During the Sabbath He continued under the earth in the tomb in which Joseph of Arimath&aelig;a had laid Him. <a name="v.iv.ix-p10.1"></A>At the dawning of the Lord&#146;s day He arose from the dead, according to what was spoken by Himself, &#8220;As Jonah was three days and three nights in the whale&#146;s belly, so shall the Son of man also be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_794"></A><A HREF="#fn_794"><FONT SIZE="1">795</FONT></A>
 The day of the preparation, then, comprises the passion; the Sabbath embraces the burial; the Lord&#146;s Day contains the resurrection.</p>
