### <span id="v.ii.xxi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XX.—Exhortations to stedfastness and unity.

<span id="v.ii.xxi-p1"></span><span id="v.ii.xxi-p1.1"></span><span
id="v.ii.xxi-p1.2"></span>Stand fast, brethren, in the faith of Jesus
Christ, and in His love, in His passion, and in His resurrection. Do ye
all come together in common, and individually, <span
id="fr_624"></span>[625](#fn_624) through grace, in one faith of God the
Father, and of Jesus Christ His only-begotten Son, and “the first-born
of every creature,” <span id="fr_625"></span>[626](#fn_625) but of the
seed of David according to the flesh, being under the guidance of the
Comforter, in obedience to the bishop and the presbytery with an
undivided mind, breaking one and the same bread, which is the medicine
of immortality, and the antidote which prevents us from dying, but a
cleansing remedy driving away evil, \[which causes\] that we should live
in God through Jesus Christ.
