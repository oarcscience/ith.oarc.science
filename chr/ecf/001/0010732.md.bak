### <span id="ix.iii.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter II.—The world was not formed by angels, or by any other being, contrary to the will of the most high God, but was made by the Father through the Word. <span id="fr_2989"></span>[2990](#fn_2989.md)

<span id="ix.iii.iii-p2"></span>1. <span
id="ix.iii.iii-p2.1"></span><span id="ix.iii.iii-p2.2"></span>Those,
moreover, who say that the world was formed by angels, or by any other
maker of it, contrary to the will of Him who is the Supreme Father, err
first of all in this very point, that they maintain that angels formed
such and so mighty a creation, contrary to the will of the Most High
God. This would imply that angels were more powerful than God; or if not
so, that He was either careless, or inferior, or paid no regard to those
things which took place among His own possessions, whether they turned
out ill or well, so that He might drive away and prevent the one, while
He praised and rejoiced over the other. But if one would not ascribe
such conduct even to a man of any ability, how much less to God

<span id="ix.iii.iii-p3"></span>2. Next let them tell us whether these
things have been formed within the limits which are contained by Him,
and in His proper territory, or in regions belonging to others, and
lying beyond Him? But if they say \[that these things were done\] beyond
Him, then all the absurdities already mentioned will face them, and the
Supreme God will be enclosed by that which is beyond Him, in which also
it will be necessary that He should find His end. If, on the other hand,
\[these things were done\] within His own proper territory, it will be
very idle to say that the world was thus formed within His proper
territory against His will by angels who are themselves under His power,
or by any other being, as if either He Himself did not behold all things
which take place among His own possessions, or <span
id="fr_2990"></span>[2991](#fn_2990.md) was not aware of the things to be
done by angels.

<span id="ix.iii.iii-p5"></span>3. If, however, \[the things referred to
were done\] not against His will, but with His concurrence and
knowledge, as some \[of these men\] think, the angels, or the Former of
the world \[whoever that may have been\], will no longer be the causes
of that formation, but the will of God. For if *He* is the Former of the
world, He too made the angels, or at least was the cause of their
creation; and He will be regarded as having made the world who prepared
the causes of its formation. Although they maintain that the angels were
made by a long succession downwards, or that the Former of the world
\[sprang\] from the Supreme Father, as Basilides asserts; nevertheless
that which is the cause of those things which have been made will still
be traced to Him who was the Author of such a succession. \[The case
stands\] just as regards success in war, which is ascribed to the king
who prepared those things which are the cause of victory; and, in like
manner, the creation of any state, or of any work, is referred to him
who prepared materials for the accomplishment of those results which
were afterwards brought about. Wherefore, we do not say that it was the
axe which cut the wood, or the saw which divided it; but one would very
properly say that the *man* cut and divided it who formed the axe and
the saw for this purpose, and \[who also formed\] at a much earlier date
all the tools by which the axe and the saw themselves were formed. With
justice, therefore, according to an analogous process of reasoning, the
Father of all will be declared the Former of this world, and not the
angels, nor any other \[so-called\] former of the world, other than He
who was its Author, and had formerly <span
id="fr_2991"></span>[2992](#fn_2991.md) been the cause of the preparation
for a creation of this kind.

<span id="ix.iii.iii-p7"></span>4. This manner of speech may perhaps be
plausible or persuasive to those who know not God, and who liken Him to
needy human beings, and to those who cannot immediately and without
assistance form anything, but require many instrumentalities to produce
what they intend. <span id="ix.iii.iii-p7.1"></span><span
id="ix.iii.iii-p7.2"></span>But it will not be regarded as at all
probable by those who know that God stands in need of nothing, and that
He created and made all things by His Word, while He neither required
angels to assist Him in the production of those things which are made,
nor of any power greatly inferior to Himself, and ignorant of the
Father, nor of any defect or ignorance, in order that he who should know
Him might become man. <span id="fr_2992"></span>[2993](#fn_2992.md) But He
Himself in Himself, after a fashion which we can neither describe nor
conceive, predestinating all things, formed them as He pleased,
bestowing harmony on all things, and assigning them their own place, and
the beginning of their creation. In this way He conferred on spiritual
things a spiritual and invisible nature, on super-celestial things a
celestial, on angels an angelical, on animals an animal, on beings that
swim a nature suited to the water, and on those that live on the land
one fitted for the land—on all, in short, a nature suitable to the
character of the life assigned them—while He formed all things that were
made by His Word that never wearies.

<span id="ix.iii.iii-p9"></span>5. <span id="ix.iii.iii-p9.1"></span>For
this is a peculiarity of the pre-eminence of God, not to stand in need
of other instruments for the creation of those things which are summoned
into existence. His own Word is both suitable and sufficient for the
formation of all things, even as John, the disciple of the Lord, <span
id="page_362">p. 362</span> <span id="ix.iii.iii-Page_362"></span>
declares regarding Him: “All things were made by Him, and without Him
was nothing made.” <span id="fr_2993"></span>[2994](#fn_2993.md) Now, among
the “all things” our world must be embraced. It too, therefore, was made
by His Word, as Scripture tells us in the book of Genesis that He made
all things connected with our world by His Word. David also expresses
the same truth \[when he says\] “For He spake, and they were made; He
commanded, and they were created.” <span
id="fr_2994"></span>[2995](#fn_2994.md) Whom, therefore, shall we believe
as to the creation of the world—these heretics who have been mentioned
that prate so foolishly and inconsistently on the subject, or the
disciples of the Lord, and Moses, who was both a faithful servant of God
and a prophet? He at first narrated the formation of the world in these
words: “In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth,” <span
id="fr_2995"></span>[2996](#fn_2995.md) and all other things in succession;
but neither gods nor angels \[had any share in the work\].

<span id="ix.iii.iii-p13"></span>Now, that this God is the Father of our
Lord Jesus Christ, Paul the apostle also has declared, \[saying,\]
“There is one God, the Father, who is above all, and through all things,
and in us all.” <span id="fr_2996"></span>[2997](#fn_2996.md) I have indeed
proved already that there is only one God; but I shall further
demonstrate this from the apostles themselves, and from the discourses
of the Lord. For what sort of conduct would it be, were we to forsake
the utterances of the prophets, of the Lord, and of the apostles, that
we might give heed to these persons, who speak not a word of sense?

meaning by applying to the redeemed that which the author says of the
Redeemer;” but it may be doubted if this is really the case. Perhaps
Massuet’s rendering of the clause, “that that man might be formed who
should know Him,” is, after all, preferable to that given above.
