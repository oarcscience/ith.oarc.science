### <span id="v.iii.xiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIV.—Your prayers requested.

<span id="v.iii.xiv-p1"></span>Knowing as I do that ye are full of God,
I have but briefly exhorted you. <span id="v.iii.xiv-p1.1"></span>Be
mindful of me in your prayers, that I may attain to God; and of the
Church which is in Syria, whence I am not worthy to derive my name: for
I stand in need of your united prayer in God, and your love, that the
Church which is in Syria may be deemed worthy of being refreshed <span
id="fr_725"></span>[726](#fn_725.md) by your Church.

<span id="v.iii.xiv-p3"></span>Knowing as I do that ye are full of all
good, I have but briefly exhorted you in the love of Jesus Christ. <span
id="v.iii.xiv-p3.1"></span>Be mindful of me in your prayers, that I may
attain to God; and of the Church which is in Syria, of whom I am not
worthy to be called bishop. For I stand in need of your united prayer in
God, and of your love, that the Church which is in Syria may be deemed
worthy, by your good order, of being edified <span
id="fr_726"></span>[727](#fn_726.md) in Christ.
