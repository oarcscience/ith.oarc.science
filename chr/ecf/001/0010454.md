### <span id="viii.iii.ix-p0.1"></span>Chapter IX.—Eternal punishment not a mere threat.

<span id="viii.iii.ix-p1"></span><span id="viii.iii.ix-p1.1"></span>And
that no one may say what is said by those who are deemed philosophers,
that our assertions that the wicked are punished in eternal fire are big
words and bugbears, and that we wish men to live virtuously through
fear, and not because such a life is good and pleasant; I will briefly
reply to this, that if this be not so, God does not exist; or, if He
exists, He cares not for men, and neither virtue nor vice is anything,
and, as we said before, lawgivers unjustly punish those who transgress
good commandments. But since these are not unjust, and their Father
teaches them by the word to do the same things as Himself, they who
agree with them are not unjust. And if one object that the laws of men
are diverse, and say that with some, one thing is considered good,
another evil, while with others what seemed bad to the former is
esteemed good, and what seemed good is esteemed bad, let him listen to
what we say to this. We know that the wicked angels appointed laws
conformable to their own wickedness, in which the men who are like them
delight; and the right Reason, <span
id="fr_1935"></span>[1936](#fn_1935.md) when He came, proved that not all
opinions nor all doctrines are good, but that some are evil, while
others are good. Wherefore, I will declare the same and similar things
to such men as these, and, if need be, they shall be spoken of more at
large. But at present I return to the subject.

as well as of the right reason diffused among men by Him.
