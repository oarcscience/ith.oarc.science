### <span id="viii.ii.lxix-p0.1"></span>Epistle of Adrian <span id="fr_1915"></span>[1916](#fn_1915.md) in behalf of the Christians.

<span id="viii.ii.lxix-p2"></span><span
id="viii.ii.lxix-p2.1"></span><span id="viii.ii.lxix-p2.2"></span><span
id="viii.ii.lxix-p2.3"></span>I have received the letter addressed to me
by your predecessor Serenius Granianus, a most illustrious man; and this
communication I am unwilling to pass over in silence, lest innocent
persons be disturbed, and occasion be given to the informers for
practising villany. Accordingly, if the inhabitants of your province
will so far sustain this petition of theirs as to accuse the Christians
in some court of law, I do not prohibit them from doing so. But I will
not suffer them to make use of mere entreaties and outcries. For it is
far more just, if any one desires to make an accusation, that you give
judgment upon it. If, therefore, any one makes the accusation, and
furnishes proof that the said men do anything contrary to the laws, you
shall adjudge punishments in proportion to the offences. And this, by
Hercules, you shall give special heed to, that if any man shall, through
mere calumny, bring an accusation against any of these persons, you
shall award to him more severe punishments in proportion to his
wickedness.
