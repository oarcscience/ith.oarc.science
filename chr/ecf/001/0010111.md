### <span id="iv.iv.xiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIII.—The funeral pile is erected.

<span id="iv.iv.xiii-p1"></span>This, then, was carried into effect with
greater speed than it was spoken, the multitudes immediately gathering
together wood and fagots out of the shops and baths; the Jews
especially, according to custom, eagerly assisting them in it. And when
the funeral pile was ready, Polycarp, laying aside all his garments, and
loosing his girdle, sought also to take off his sandals,—a thing he was
not accustomed to do, inasmuch as every one of the faithful was always
eager who should first touch his skin. <span
id="iv.iv.xiii-p1.1"></span>For, on account of his holy life, <span
id="fr_453"></span>[454](#fn_453) he was, even before his martyrdom,
adorned <span id="fr_454"></span>[455](#fn_454) with every kind of good.
Immediately then they surrounded him with those substances which had
been prepared for the funeral pile. But when they were about also to fix
him with nails, he said, “Leave me as I am; for He that giveth me
strength to endure the fire, will also enable me, without your securing
me by nails, to remain without moving in the pile.”

<span id="iv.iv.xiii-p3"></span> Some think this implies that Polycarp’s
skin was believed to possess a miraculous efficacy.
