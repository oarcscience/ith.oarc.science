### <span id="viii.v.ii-p0.1"></span>Chapter II.—The Greek theogony exposed.

<span id="viii.v.ii-p1"></span><span id="viii.v.ii-p1.1"></span><span
id="viii.v.ii-p1.2"></span>But since, next to Homer, Hesiod wrote his
*Works and Days*, who will believe his drivelling theogony? For they say
that Chronos, the son of Ouranos, <span
id="fr_2496"></span>[2497](#fn_2496.md) in the beginning slew his father,
and possessed himself of his rule; and that, being seized with a panic
lest he should himself suffer in the same way, he preferred devouring
his children; but that, by the craft of the Curetes, Jupiter was
conveyed away and kept in secret, and afterwards bound his father with
chains, and divided the empire; Jupiter receiving, as the story goes,
the air, and Neptune the deep, and Pluto the portion of Hades. But Pluto
ravished Proserpine; and Ceres sought her child wandering through the
deserts. And this myth was celebrated in the Eleusinian fire. <span
id="fr_2497"></span>[2498](#fn_2497.md) Again, Neptune ravished Melanippe
when she was drawing water, besides abusing a host of Nereids not a few,
whose names, were we to recount them, would cost us a multitude of
words. And as for Jupiter, he was a various adulterer, with Antiope as a
satyr, with Danaë as gold, and with Europa as a bull; with Leda,
moreover, he assumed wings. For the love of Semele proved both his
unchastity and the jealousy of Semele. And they say that he carried off
the Phrygian Ganymede to be his cup-bearer. These, then, are the
exploits of the sons of Saturn. And your illustrious son of Latona
\[Apollo\], who professed soothsaying, convicted himself of lying. He
pursued Daphne, but did not gain possession of her; and to
Hyacinthus, <span id="fr_2498"></span>[2499](#fn_2498.md) who loved him, he
did not foretell his death. And I say nothing of the masculine character
of Minerva, nor of the feminine nature of Bacchus, nor of the
fornicating disposition of Venus. Read to Jupiter, ye Greeks, the law
against parricides, and the penalty of adultery, and the ignominy of
pæderasty. Teach Minerva and Diana the works of women, and Bacchus the
works of men. What seemliness is <span id="page_272">p. 272</span> <span
id="viii.v.ii-Page_272"></span> there in a woman’s girding herself with
armour, or in a man’s decorating himself with cymbals, and garlands, and
female attire, and accompanied by a herd of bacchanalian women?
