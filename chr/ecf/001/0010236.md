### <span id="v.xi.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter IX.

<span id="v.xi.iv-p1"></span><span id="v.xi.iv-p1.1"></span>And ye are
prepared for the building of God the Father, and ye are raised up on
high by the instrument of Jesus Christ, which is the cross; and ye are
drawn by the rope, which is the Holy Spirit; and your pulley is your
faith, and your love is the way which leadeth up on high to God.
