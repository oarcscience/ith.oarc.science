### <span id="v.xi.vii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XV.

<span id="v.xi.vii-p1"></span>It is better that a man should be silent
while he is something, than that he should be talking when he is not;
that by those things which be speaks he should act, and by those things
of which he is silent he should be known.
