### <span id="ix.vii.viii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VII.—Inasmuch as Christ did rise in our flesh, it follows that we shall be also raised in the same; since the resurrection promised to us should not be referred to spirits naturally immortal, but to bodies in themselves mortal.

<span id="ix.vii.viii-p1"></span>1. <span
id="ix.vii.viii-p1.1"></span><span id="ix.vii.viii-p1.2"></span>In the
same manner, therefore, as Christ did rise in the substance of flesh,
and pointed out to His disciples the mark of the nails and the opening
in His side <span id="fr_4482"></span>[4483](#fn_4482) (now these are
the tokens of that flesh which rose from the dead), so “shall He also,”
it is said, “raise us up by His own power.” <span
id="fr_4483"></span>[4484](#fn_4483) And again to the Romans he says,
“But if the Spirit of Him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in
you, He that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your
mortal bodies.” <span id="fr_4484"></span>[4485](#fn_4484) What, then,
are mortal bodies? Can they be souls? Nay, for souls are incorporeal
when put in comparison with mortal bodies; for God “breathed into the
face of man the breath of life, and man became a living soul.” Now the
breath of life is an incorporeal <span id="page_533">p. 533</span> <span
id="ix.vii.viii-Page_533"></span> thing. And certainly they cannot
maintain that the very breath of life is mortal. Therefore David says,
“My soul also shall live to Him,” <span
id="fr_4485"></span>[4486](#fn_4485) just as if its substance were
immortal. Neither, on the other hand, can they say that the spirit is
the mortal body. What therefore is there left to which we may apply the
term “mortal body,” unless it be the thing that was moulded, that is,
the flesh, of which it is also said that God will vivify it? For this it
is which dies and is decomposed, but not the soul or the spirit. For to
die is to lose vital power, and to become henceforth breathless,
inanimate, and devoid of motion, and to melt away into those \[component
parts\] from which also it derived the commencement of \[its\]
substance. But this event happens neither to the soul, for it is the
breath of life; nor to the spirit, for the spirit is simple and not
composite, so that it cannot be decomposed, and is itself the life of
those who receive it. We must therefore conclude that it is in reference
to the flesh that death is mentioned; which \[flesh\], after the soul’s
departure, becomes breathless and inanimate, and is decomposed gradually
into the earth from which it was taken. This, then, is what is mortal.
And it is this of which he also says, “He shall also quicken your mortal
bodies.” And therefore in reference to it he says, in the first
\[Epistle\] to the Corinthians: “So also is the resurrection of the
dead: it is sown in corruption, it rises in incorruption.” <span
id="fr_4486"></span>[4487](#fn_4486) For he declares, “That which thou
sowest cannot be quickened, unless first it die.” <span
id="fr_4487"></span>[4488](#fn_4487)

<span id="ix.vii.viii-p8"></span>2. But what is that which, like a grain
of wheat, is sown in the earth and decays, unless it be the bodies which
are laid in the earth, into which seeds are also cast? And for this
reason he said, “It is sown in dishonour, it rises in glory.” <span
id="fr_4488"></span>[4489](#fn_4488) For what is more ignoble than dead
flesh? Or, on the other hand, what is more glorious than the same when
it arises and partakes of incorruption? “It is sown in weakness, it is
raised in power:” <span id="fr_4489"></span>[4490](#fn_4489) in its own
weakness certainly, because since it is earth it goes to earth; but \[it
is quickened\] by the power of God, who raises it from the dead. “It is
sown an animal body, it rises a spiritual body.” <span
id="fr_4490"></span>[4491](#fn_4490) He has taught, beyond all doubt,
that such language was not used by him, either with reference to the
soul or to the spirit, but to bodies that have become corpses. For these
are animal bodies, that is, \[bodies\] which partake of life, which when
they have lost, they succumb to death; then, rising through the Spirit’s
instrumentality, they become spiritual bodies, so that by the Spirit
they possess a perpetual life. “For now,” he says, “we know in part, and
we prophesy in part, but then face to face.” <span
id="fr_4491"></span>[4492](#fn_4491) And this it is which has been said
also by Peter: “Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom now also, not
seeing, ye believe; and believing, ye shall rejoice with joy
unspeakable.” <span id="fr_4492"></span>[4493](#fn_4492) For our face
shall see the face of the Lord <span
id="fr_4493"></span>[4494](#fn_4493) and shall rejoice with joy
unspeakable,—that is to say, when it shall behold its own Delight.
