### <span id="vi.ii.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.—The new covenant, founded on the sufferings of Christ, tends to our salvation, but to the Jews’ destruction.

<span id="vi.ii.v-p1"></span><span id="vi.ii.v-p1.1"></span><span
id="vi.ii.v-p1.2"></span><span id="vi.ii.v-p1.3"></span><span
id="vi.ii.v-p1.4"></span>For to this end the Lord endured to deliver up
His flesh to corruption, that we might be sanctified through the
remission of sins, which is effected by His blood of sprinkling. For it
is written concerning Him, partly with reference to Israel, and partly
to us; and \[the Scripture\] saith thus: “He was wounded for our
transgressions, and bruised for our iniquities: with His stripes we are
healed. He was brought as a sheep to the slaughter, and as a lamb which
is dumb before its shearer.” <span id="fr_1480"></span>[1481](#fn_1480.md)
Therefore we ought to be deeply grateful to the Lord, because He has
both made known to us things that are past, and hath given us wisdom
concerning things present, and hath not left us without understanding in
regard to things which are to come. Now, the Scripture saith, “Not
unjustly are nets spread out for birds.” <span
id="fr_1481"></span>[1482](#fn_1481.md) This means that the man perishes
justly, who, having a knowledge of the way of righteousness, rushes off
into the way of darkness. And further, my brethren: if the Lord endured
to suffer for our soul, He being Lord of all the world, to whom God said
at the foundation of the world, “Let us make man after our image, and
after our likeness,” <span id="fr_1482"></span>[1483](#fn_1482.md)
understand how it was that He endured to suffer at the hand of men. The
prophets, having obtained grace from Him, prophesied concerning Him. And
He (since it behoved Him to appear in flesh), that He might abolish
death, and reveal the resurrection from the dead, endured \[what and as
He did\], in order that He might fulfil the promise made unto the
fathers, and by preparing a new people for Himself, might show, while He
dwelt on earth, that He, when He has raised mankind, will also judge
them. Moreover, teaching Israel, and doing so great miracles and signs,
He preached \[the truth\] to him, and greatly loved him. But when He
chose His own apostles who were to preach His Gospel, \[He did so from
among those\] who were sinners above all sin, that He might show He came
“not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.” <span
id="fr_1483"></span>[1484](#fn_1483.md) Then He manifested Himself to be
the Son of God. For if He had not come in the flesh, how could men have
been saved by beholding Him? <span id="fr_1484"></span>[1485](#fn_1484.md)
Since looking upon <span id="page_140">p. 140</span> <span
id="vi.ii.v-Page_140"></span> the sun which is to cease to exist, and is
the work of His hands, their eyes are not able to bear his rays. The Son
of God therefore came in the flesh with this view, that He might bring
to a head the sum of their sins who had persecuted His prophets <span
id="fr_1485"></span>[1486](#fn_1485.md) to the death. <span
id="vi.ii.v-p7.1"></span>For this purpose, then, He endured. For God
saith, “The stroke of his flesh is from them;” <span
id="fr_1486"></span>[1487](#fn_1486.md) and <span
id="fr_1487"></span>[1488](#fn_1487.md) “when I shall smite the Shepherd,
then the sheep of the flock shall be scattered.” <span
id="fr_1488"></span>[1489](#fn_1488.md) He himself willed thus to suffer,
for it was necessary that He should suffer on the tree. For says he who
prophesies regarding Him, “Spare my soul from the sword, <span
id="fr_1489"></span>[1490](#fn_1489.md) fasten my flesh with nails; for the
assemblies of the wicked have risen up against me.” <span
id="fr_1490"></span>[1491](#fn_1490.md) And again he says, “Behold, I have
given my back to scourges, and my cheeks to strokes, and I have set my
countenance as a firm rock.” <span id="fr_1491"></span>[1492](#fn_1491.md)
