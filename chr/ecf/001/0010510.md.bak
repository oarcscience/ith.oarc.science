### <span id="viii.iv.xlix-p0.1"></span>Chapter XLIX.—To those who object that Elijah has not yet come, he replies that he is the precursor of the first advent.

<span id="viii.iv.xlix-p1"></span>And Trypho said, “Those who affirm him
to have been a man, and to have been anointed by election, and then to
have become Christ, appear to me to speak more plausibly than you who
hold those opinions which you express. <span
id="viii.iv.xlix-p1.1"></span>For we all expect that Christ will be a
man \[born\] of men, and that Elijah when he comes will anoint him. But
if this man appear to be Christ, he must certainly be known as man
\[born\] of men; but from the circumstance that Elijah has not yet come,
I infer that this man is not He \[the Christ\].”

<span id="viii.iv.xlix-p2"></span>Then I inquired of him, “Does not
Scripture, in the book of Zechariah, <span
id="fr_2099"></span>[2100](#fn_2099.md) say that Elijah shall come before
the great and terrible day of the Lord?”

<span id="viii.iv.xlix-p4"></span>And he answered, “Certainly.”

<span id="viii.iv.xlix-p5"></span>“If therefore Scripture compels you to
admit that two advents of Christ were predicted to take place,—one in
which He would appear suffering, and dishonoured, and without
comeliness; but the other in which He would come glorious and Judge of
all, as has been made manifest in many of the fore-cited passages,—shall
we not suppose that the word of God has proclaimed that Elijah shall be
the precursor of the great and terrible day, that is, of His second
advent?”

<span id="viii.iv.xlix-p6"></span>“Certainly,” he answered.

<span id="viii.iv.xlix-p7"></span>“And, accordingly, our Lord in His
teaching,” I continued, “proclaimed that this very thing would take
place, saying that Elijah would also come. And we know that this shall
take place when our Lord Jesus Christ shall come in glory from heaven;
whose first manifestation the Spirit of God who was in Elijah preceded
as herald in \[the person of\] John, a prophet among your nation; after
whom no other prophet appeared among you. He cried, as he sat by the
river Jordan: ‘I baptize you with water to repentance; but He that is
stronger than I shall come, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: He
shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire: whose fan is in His
hand, and He will thoroughly purge His floor, and will gather the wheat
into the barn; but the chaff He will burn up with unquenchable
fire.’ <span id="fr_2100"></span>[2101](#fn_2100.md) And this very prophet
your king Herod had shut up in prison; and when his birthday was
celebrated, and the niece <span id="fr_2101"></span>[2102](#fn_2101.md) of
the same Herod by her dancing had pleased him, he told her to ask
whatever she pleased. <span id="page_220">p. 220</span> <span
id="viii.iv.xlix-Page_220"></span> Then the mother of the maiden
instigated her to ask the head of John, who was in prison; and having
asked it, \[Herod\] sent and ordered the head of John to be brought in
on a charger. Wherefore also our Christ said, \[when He was\] on earth,
to those who were affirming that Elijah must come before Christ: ‘Elijah
shall come, and restore all things; but I say unto you, that Elijah has
already come, and they knew him not, but have done to him whatsoever
they chose.’ <span id="fr_2102"></span>[2103](#fn_2102.md) And it is
written, ‘Then the disciples understood that He spake to them about John
the Baptist.’ ”

<span id="viii.iv.xlix-p11"></span>And Trypho said, “This statement also
seems to me paradoxical; namely, that the prophetic Spirit of God, who
was in Elijah, was also in John.”

<span id="viii.iv.xlix-p12"></span>To this I replied, “Do you not think
that the same thing happened in the case of Joshua the son of Nave
(Nun), who succeeded to the command of the people after Moses, when
Moses was commanded to lay his hands on Joshua, and God said to him, ‘I
will take of the spirit which is in thee, and put it on him?’ ” <span
id="fr_2103"></span>[2104](#fn_2103.md)

<span id="viii.iv.xlix-p14"></span>And he said, “Certainly.”

<span id="viii.iv.xlix-p15"></span>“As therefore,” I say, “while Moses
was still among men, God took of the spirit which was in Moses and put
it on Joshua, even so God was able to cause \[the spirit\] of Elijah to
come upon John; in order that, as Christ at His first coming appeared
inglorious, even so the first coming of the spirit, which remained
always pure in Elijah <span id="fr_2104"></span>[2105](#fn_2104.md) like
that of Christ, might be perceived to be inglorious. For the Lord said
He would wage war against Amalek with concealed hand; and you will not
deny that Amalek fell. But if it is said that only in the glorious
advent of Christ war will be waged with Amalek, how great will the
fulfilment <span id="fr_2105"></span>[2106](#fn_2105.md) of Scripture be
which says, ‘God will wage war against Amalek with concealed hand!’ You
can perceive that the concealed power of God was in Christ the
crucified, before whom demons, and all the principalities and powers of
the earth, tremble.”
