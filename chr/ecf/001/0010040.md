### <span id="ii.ii.xxxv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXV.—Immense is this reward. How shall we obtain it?

<span id="ii.ii.xxxv-p1"></span><span id="ii.ii.xxxv-p1.1"></span><span
id="ii.ii.xxxv-p1.2"></span><span id="ii.ii.xxxv-p1.3"></span>How
blessed and wonderful, beloved, are the gifts of God! Life in
immortality, splendour in righteousness, truth in perfect
confidence, <span id="fr_144"></span>[145](#fn_144.md) faith in assurance,
self-control in holiness! And all these fall under the cognizance of our
understandings \[now\]; what then shall those things be which are
prepared for such as wait for Him? The Creator and Father of all
worlds, <span id="fr_145"></span>[146](#fn_145.md) the Most Holy, alone
knows their amount and their beauty. Let us therefore earnestly strive
to be found in the number of those that wait for Him, in order that we
may share in His promised gifts. <span id="ii.ii.xxxv-p3.1"></span>But
how, beloved, shall this be done? If our understanding be fixed by faith
towards God; if we earnestly seek the things which are pleasing and
acceptable to Him; if we do the things which are in harmony with His
blameless will; and if we follow the way of truth, casting away from us
all unrighteousness and iniquity, along with all covetousness, strife,
evil practices, deceit, whispering, and evil-speaking, all hatred of
God, pride and haughtiness, vainglory and ambition. <span
id="fr_146"></span>[147](#fn_146.md) For they that do such things are
hateful to God; and not only they that do them, but also those that take
pleasure in them that do them. <span id="fr_147"></span>[148](#fn_147.md)
For the Scripture saith, “But to the sinner God said, Wherefore dost
thou declare my statutes, and take my covenant into thy mouth, seeing
thou hatest instruction, and castest my words behind thee? When thou
sawest a thief, thou consentedst with <span
id="fr_148"></span>[149](#fn_148.md) him, and didst make thy portion with
adulterers. Thy mouth has abounded with wickedness, and thy tongue
contrived <span id="fr_149"></span>[150](#fn_149.md) deceit. Thou sittest,
and speakest against thy brother; thou slanderest <span
id="fr_150"></span>[151](#fn_150.md) thine own mother’s son. These things
thou hast done, and I kept silence; thou thoughtest, wicked one, that I
should be like to thyself. But I will reprove thee, and set thyself
before thee. Consider now these things, ye that forget God, lest He tear
you in pieces, like a lion, and there be none to deliver. The sacrifice
of praise will glorify Me, and a way is there by which I will show him
the salvation of God.” <span id="fr_151"></span>[152](#fn_151.md)
