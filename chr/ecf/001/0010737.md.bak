### <span id="ix.iii.viii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VII.—Created things are not the images of those Æons who are within the Pleroma.

<span id="ix.iii.viii-p1"></span>1. <span
id="ix.iii.viii-p1.1"></span>While the Demiurge was thus ignorant of all
things, they tell us that the Saviour conferred honour upon the Pleroma
by the creation \[which he summoned into existence\] through means of
his Mother, inasmuch as he produced similitudes and images of those
things which are above. But I have already shown that it was impossible
that anything should exist *beyond* the Pleroma (in which external
region they tell us that images were made of those things which are
within the Pleroma), or that this world was formed by any other one than
the Supreme God. But it is a pleasant thing to overthrow them on every
side, and to prove them vendors of falsehood; let us say, in opposition
to them, that if these things were made by the Saviour to the honour of
those which are above, after their likeness, then it behoved them always
to endure, that those things which have been honoured should perpetually
continue in honour. But if they do in fact pass away, what is the use of
this very brief period of honour,—an honour which at one time had no
existence, and which shall again come to nothing? In that case I shall
prove that the Saviour is rather an aspirant after vainglory, than <span
id="fr_3014"></span>[3015](#fn_3014.md) one who honours those things which
are above. For what honour can those things which are temporal confer on
such as are eternal and endure for ever? or those which pass away on
such as remain? or those which are corruptible on such as are
incorruptible?—since, even among men who are themselves mortal, there is
no value attached to that honour which speedily passes away, but to that
which endures as long as it possibly can. But those things which, as
soon as they are made, come to an end, may justly be said rather to have
been formed for the contempt of such as are thought to be honoured by
them; and that that which is eternal is contumeliously treated when its
image is corrupted and dissolved. But what if their Mother had not wept,
and laughed, and been involved in despair? The Saviour would not then
have possessed any means of honouring the Fulness, inasmuch as her last
state of confusion <span id="fr_3015"></span>[3016](#fn_3015.md) did not
have substance of its own by which it might honour the Propator.

<span id="ix.iii.viii-p4"></span>2. Alas for the honour of vainglory
which at once passes away, and no longer appears! There will be
some <span id="fr_3016"></span>[3017](#fn_3016.md) Æon, in whose case such
honour will not be thought at all to have had an existence, and then the
things which are above will be unhonoured; or it will be necessary to
produce once more another Mother weeping, and in despair, in order to
the honour of the Pleroma. What a dissimilar, and at the same time
blasphemous image! Do you tell me that an image of the Only-begotten was
produced by the former <span id="fr_3017"></span>[3018](#fn_3017.md) of the
world, whom <span id="fr_3018"></span>[3019](#fn_3018.md) again ye wish to
be considered the Nous (mind) of the Father of all, and \[yet maintain\]
that this image was ignorant of itself, ignorant of creation,—ignorant,
too, of the Mother,—ignorant of everything that exists, and of those
things which were made by it; and are you not ashamed while, in
opposition to yourselves, you ascribe ignorance even to the
Only-begotten Himself? For if these things \[below\] were made by the
Saviour after the similitude of those which are above, while He (the
Demiurge) who was made after such similitude was in so great ignorance,
it necessarily follows that around Him, and in accordance with Him,
after whose likeness he that is thus ignorant was formed, ignorance of
the kind in question spiritually exists. <span id="page_367">p.
367</span> <span id="ix.iii.viii-Page_367"></span> For it is not
possible, since both were produced spiritually, and neither fashioned
nor composed, that in some the likeness was preserved, while in others
the likeness of the image was spoiled, that image which was here
produced that it might be according to the image of that production
which is above. But if it is not similar, the charge will then attach to
the Saviour, who produced a dissimilar image,—of being, so to speak, an
incompetent workman. For it is out of their power to affirm that the
Saviour had not the faculty of production, since they style Him *All
Things*. If, then, the image is dissimilar, he is a poor workman, and
the blame lies, according to their hypothesis, with the Saviour. If, on
the other hand, it is similar, then the same ignorance will be found to
exist in the Nous (mind) of their Propator, that is, in the
Only-begotten. The Nous of the Father, in that case, was ignorant of
Himself; ignorant, too, of the Father; ignorant, moreover, of those very
things which were formed by Him. But if *He* has knowledge, it
necessarily follows also that he who was formed after his likeness by
the Saviour should know the things which are like; and thus, according
to their own principles, their monstrous blasphemy is overthrown.

<span id="ix.iii.viii-p8"></span>3. Apart from this, however, how can
those things which belong to creation, various, manifold, and
innumerable as they are, be the images of those thirty Æons which are
within the Pleroma, whose names, as these men fix them, I have set forth
in the book which precedes this? And not only will they be unable to
adapt the \[vast\] variety of creation at large to the \[comparative\]
smallness of their Pleroma, but they cannot do this even with respect to
any one part of it, whether \[that possessed by\] celestial or
terrestrial beings, or those that live in the waters. For they
themselves testify that their Pleroma consists of thirty Æons; but any
one will undertake to show that, in a single department of those
\[created beings\] which have been mentioned, they reckon that there are
not thirty, but many thousands of species. How then can those things,
which constitute such a multiform creation, which are opposed in nature
to each other, and disagree among themselves, and destroy the one the
other, be the images and likenesses of the thirty Æons of the Pleroma,
if indeed, as they declare, these being possessed of one nature, are of
equal and similar properties, and exhibit no differences \[among
themselves\]? For it was incumbent, if these things are images of those
Æons,—inasmuch as they declare that some men are wicked by nature, and
some, on the other hand, naturally good,—to point out such differences
also among their Æons, and to maintain that some of them were produced
naturally good, while some were naturally evil, so that the supposition
of the likeness of those things might harmonize with the Æons. Moreover,
since there are in the world some creatures that are gentle, and others
that are fierce, some that are innocuous, while others are hurtful and
destroy the rest; some have their abode on the earth, others in the
water, others in the air, and others in the heaven; in like manner, they
are bound to show that the Æons possess such properties, if indeed the
one are the images of the others. And besides; “the eternal fire which
the Father has prepared for the devil and his angels,” <span
id="fr_3019"></span>[3020](#fn_3019.md) — they ought to show of which of
those Æons that are above it is the image; for it, too, is reckoned part
of the creation.

<span id="ix.iii.viii-p10"></span>4. If, however, they say that these
things are the images of the Enthymesis of that Æon who fell into
passion, then, first of all, they will act impiously against their
Mother, by declaring her to be the first cause of evil and corruptible
images. And then, again, how can those things which are manifold, and
dissimilar, and contrary in their nature, be the images of one and the
same Being? And if they say that the angels of the Pleroma are numerous,
and that those things which are many are the images of these—not in this
way either will the account they give be satisfactory. For, in the first
place, they are then bound to point out differences among the angels of
the Pleroma, which are mutually opposed to each other, even as the
images existing below are of a contrary nature among themselves. And
then, again, since there are many, yea, innumerable angels who surround
the Creator, as all the prophets acknowledge,—\[saying, for instance,\]
“Ten thousand times ten thousand stood beside Him, and many thousands of
thousands ministered unto Him,” <span
id="fr_3020"></span>[3021](#fn_3020.md) —then, according <span
id="fr_3021"></span>[3022](#fn_3021.md) to them, the angels of the Pleroma
will have as images the angels of the Creator, and the entire creation
remains in the image of the Pleroma, but so that the thirty Æons no
longer correspond to the manifold variety of the creation.

<span id="ix.iii.viii-p13"></span>5. Still further, if these things
\[below\] were made after the similitude of those \[above\], after the
likeness of which again will those then be made? For if the Creator of
the world did not form these things directly from His own <span
id="fr_3022"></span>[3023](#fn_3022.md) conception, but, like an architect
of no ability, or a boy receiving his first lesson, copied them from
archetypes furnished by others, then whence did their Bythus obtain the
forms of that creation which He at first produced? It clearly follows
<span id="page_368">p. 368</span> <span
id="ix.iii.viii-Page_368"></span> that He must have received the model
from some other one who is above Him, and that one, in turn, from
another. And none the less \[for these suppositions\], the talk about
images, as about gods, will extend to infinity, if we do not at once fix
our mind on one Artificer, and on one God, who of Himself formed those
things which have been created. Or is it really the case that, in regard
to mere men, one will allow that they have of themselves invented what
is useful for the purposes of life, but will not grant to that God who
formed the world, that of Himself He created the forms of those things
which have been made, and imparted to it its orderly arrangement?

<span id="ix.iii.viii-p15"></span>6. But, again, how can these things
\[below\] be images of those \[above\], since they are really contrary
to them, and can in no respect have sympathy with them? For those things
which are contrary to each other may indeed be destructive of those to
which they are contrary, but can by no means be their images—as, for
instance, water and fire; or, again, light and darkness, and other such
things, can never be the images of one another. In like manner, neither
can those things which are corruptible and earthly, and of a compound
nature, and transitory, be the images of those which, according to these
men, are spiritual; unless these very things themselves be allowed to be
compound, limited in space, and of a definite shape, and thus no longer
spiritual, and diffused, and spreading into vast extent, and
incomprehensible. For they must of necessity be possessed of a definite
figure, and confined within certain limits, that they may be true
images; and then it is decided that they are not spiritual. If, however,
these men maintain that they are spiritual, and diffused, and
incomprehensible, how can those things which are possessed of figure,
and confined within certain limits, be the images of such as are
destitute of figure and incomprehensible?

<span id="ix.iii.viii-p16"></span>7. If, again, they affirm that neither
according to configuration nor formation, but according to number and
the order of production, those things \[above\] are the images \[of
these below\], then, in the first place, these things \[below\] ought
not to be spoken of as images and likenesses of those Æons that are
above. For how can the things which have neither the fashion nor shape
of those \[above\] be their images? And, in the next place, they would
adapt both the numbers and productions of the Æons above, so as to
render them identical with and similar to those that belong to the
creation \[below\]. But now, since they refer to only thirty Æons, and
declare that the vast multitude of things which are embraced within the
creation \[below\] are images of those that are but thirty, we may
justly condemn them as utterly destitute of sense.

<span id="ix.iii.viii-p2"></span> Harvey supposes that the translator
here read <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii.viii-p2.1"></span>ἤ</span> *quam* instead of <span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.iii.viii-p2.2"></span>ᾗ</span> *quâ*
(gloria); but Grabe, Massuet, and Stieren prefer to delete *erit*.

<span id="fn_3015"></span>[366:3016](0010737.htm#fr_3015.md) <span
id="ix.iii.viii-p2.3"></span>

<span id="ix.iii.viii-p3"></span> Reference is here made to the supposed
wretched state of Achamoth as lying in the region of shadow, vacuity,
and, in fact, non-existence, until compassionated by the Christ above,
who gave her form as respected *substance*.

<span id="fn_3016"></span>[366:3017](0010737.htm#fr_3016.md) <span
id="ix.iii.viii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="ix.iii.viii-p5"></span> We have literally translated the above
very obscure sentence. According to Massuet, the sense is: “There will
some time be, or perhaps even now there is, some Æon utterly destitute
of such honour, inasmuch as those things which the Saviour, for the sake
of honouring it, had formed after its image, have been destroyed; and
then those things which are above will remain without honour,” etc.

<span id="fn_3017"></span>[366:3018](0010737.htm#fr_3017.md) <span
id="ix.iii.viii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ix.iii.viii-p6"></span> The Saviour is here referred to, as
having formed all things through means of Achamoth and the Demiurge.

<span id="fn_3018"></span>[366:3019](0010737.htm#fr_3018.md) <span
id="ix.iii.viii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="ix.iii.viii-p7"></span> Massuet deletes *quem*, and reads
*nūn* as a genitive.

id="ix.iii.viii-p11.2"></span>

<span id="ix.iii.viii-p12"></span> This clause is exceedingly obscure.
Harvey remarks upon it as follows: “The reasoning of Irenæus seems to be
this: According to the Gnostic theory, the Æons and angels of the
Pleroma were homogeneous. They were also the archetypes of things
created. But things created are heterogeneous: therefore either these
Æons are heterogeneous, which is contrary to theory; or things created
are homogeneous, which is contrary to fact.”

<span id="fn_3022"></span>[367:3023](0010737.htm#fr_3022.md) <span
id="ix.iii.viii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="ix.iii.viii-p14"></span> Literally, “from Himself.”
