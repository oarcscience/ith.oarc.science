### <span id="ii.ii.ii-p0.1"></span>Chapter II.—Praise of the Corinthians continued.

<span id="ii.ii.ii-p1"></span>Moreover, ye were all distinguished by
humility, and were in no respect puffed up with pride, but yielded
obedience rather than extorted it, <span id="fr_5"></span>[6](#fn_5.md) and
were more willing to give than to receive. <span
id="fr_6"></span>[7](#fn_6.md) Content with the provision which God had
made for you, and carefully attending to His words, ye were inwardly
filled <span id="fr_7"></span>[8](#fn_7.md) with His doctrine, and His
sufferings were before your eyes. <span id="ii.ii.ii-p4.1"></span>Thus a
profound and abundant peace was given to you all, and ye had an
insatiable desire for doing good, while a full outpouring of the Holy
Spirit was upon you all. Full of holy designs, ye did, with true
earnestness of mind and a godly confidence, stretch forth your hands to
God Almighty, beseeching Him to be merciful unto you, if ye had been
guilty of any involuntary transgression. Day and night ye were anxious
for the whole brotherhood, <span id="fr_8"></span>[9](#fn_8.md) that the
number of God’s elect might be saved with mercy and a good
conscience. <span id="fr_9"></span>[10](#fn_9.md) Ye were sincere and
uncorrupted, and forgetful of injuries between one another. Every kind
of faction and schism was abominable in your sight. Ye mourned over the
transgressions of your neighbours: their deficiencies you deemed your
own. Ye never grudged any act of kindness, being “ready to every good
work.” <span id="fr_10"></span>[11](#fn_10.md) Adorned by a thoroughly
virtuous and religious life, ye did all things in the fear of God. The
commandments and ordinances of the Lord were written upon the tablets of
your hearts. <span id="fr_11"></span>[12](#fn_11.md)
