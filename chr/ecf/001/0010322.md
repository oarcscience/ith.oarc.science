### <span id="v.xxii.i-p0.1"></span>Her friend <span id="fr_1391"></span>[1392](#fn_1391) Ignatius to the Christ-bearing Mary.

<span id="v.xxii.i-p2"></span><span id="v.xxii.i-p2.1"></span><span
id="v.xxii.i-p2.2"></span><span id="v.xxii.i-p2.3"></span><span
class="upper"><span id="v.xxii.i-p2.4"></span>Thou</span> oughtest to
have comforted and consoled me who am a neophyte, and a disciple of thy
\[beloved\] John. For I have heard things wonderful to tell respecting
thy \[son\] Jesus, and I am astonished by such a report. But I desire
with my whole heart to obtain information concerning the things which I
have heard from thee, who wast always intimate and allied with Him, and
who wast acquainted with \[all\] His secrets. I have also written to
thee at another time, and have asked thee concerning the same things.
Fare thou well; and let the neophytes who are with me be comforted of
thee, and by thee, and in thee. Amen.

<span id="v.xxii.i-p1"></span> Literally, “his own.” \[Mary is here
called <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.xxii.i-p1.1"></span>χριστοτόκος</span>, and not <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.xxii.i-p1.2"></span>θεοτόκος</span>, which
suggests a Nestorian forgery.\]
