### <span id="ix.vii.xxx-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXIX.—All things have been created for the service of man. The deceits, wickedness, and apostate power of Antichrist. This was prefigured at the deluge, as afterwards by the persecution of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.

<span id="ix.vii.xxx-p1"></span>1. <span id="ix.vii.xxx-p1.1"></span>In
the previous books I have set forth the causes for which God permitted
these things to be made, and have pointed out that all such have been
created for the benefit of that human nature which is saved, ripening
for immortality that which is \[possessed\] of its own free will and its
own power, and preparing and rendering it more adapted for eternal
subjection to God. And therefore the creation is suited to \[the wants
of\] man; for man was not made for its sake, but creation for the sake
of man. Those nations however, who did not of themselves raise up their
eyes unto heaven, nor returned thanks to their Maker, nor wished to
behold the light of truth, but who were like blind mice concealed in the
depths of ignorance, the word justly reckons “as waste water from a
sink, and as the turning-weight of a balance—in fact, as nothing;” <span
id="fr_4697"></span>[4698](#fn_4697.md) so far useful and serviceable to
the just, as stubble conduces towards the growth of the wheat, and its
straw, by means of combustion, serves for working gold. And therefore,
when in the end the Church shall be suddenly caught up from this, it is
said, “There shall be tribulation such as has not been since the
beginning, neither shall be.” <span id="fr_4698"></span>[4699](#fn_4698.md)
For this is the last contest of the righteous, in which, when they
overcome they are crowned with incorruption.

<span id="ix.vii.xxx-p4"></span>2. And there is therefore in this beast,
when he comes, a recapitulation made of all sorts of iniquity and of
every deceit, in order that all apostate power, flowing into and being
shut up in him, may be sent into the furnace of fire. Fittingly,
therefore, shall his name possess the number six hundred and sixty-six,
since he sums up in his own person all the commixture of wickedness
which took place previous to the deluge, due to the apostasy of the
angels. For Noah was six hundred years old when the deluge came upon the
earth, sweeping away the rebellious world, for the sake of that most
infamous generation which lived in the times of Noah. And \[Antichrist\]
also sums up every error of devised idols since the flood, together with
the slaying of the prophets and the cutting off of the just. For that
image which was set up by Nebuchadnezzar had indeed a height of sixty
cubits, while the breadth was six cubits; on account of which Ananias,
Azarias, and Misaël, when they did not worship it, were cast into a
furnace of fire, pointing out prophetically, by what happened to them,
the wrath against the righteous which shall arise towards the \[time of
the\] end. For that image, taken as a whole, was a prefiguring of this
man’s coming, decreeing that he should undoubtedly himself alone be
worshipped by all men. Thus, then, the six hundred years of Noah, in
whose time the deluge occurred because of the apostasy, and the number
of the cubits of the image for which these just men were sent into the
fiery furnace, do indicate the number of the name of that man in whom is
concentrated the whole apostasy of six thousand years, and
unrighteousness, and wickedness, and false prophecy, and deception; for
which things’ sake a cataclysm of fire shall also come \[upon the
earth\].
