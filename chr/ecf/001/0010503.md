### <span id="viii.iv.xlii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XLII.—The bells on the priest’s robe were a figure of the apostles.

<span id="viii.iv.xlii-p1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.xlii-p1.1"></span><span id="viii.iv.xlii-p1.2"></span><span
id="viii.iv.xlii-p1.3"></span><span id="viii.iv.xlii-p1.4"></span><span
id="viii.iv.xlii-p1.5"></span>“Moreover, the prescription that twelve
bells <span id="fr_2061"></span>[2062](#fn_2061) be attached to the
\[robe\] of the high priest, which hung down to the feet, was a symbol
of the twelve apostles, who depend on the power of Christ, the eternal
Priest; and through their voice it is that all the earth has been filled
with the glory and grace of God and of His Christ. Wherefore David also
says: ‘Their sound has gone forth into all the earth, and their words to
the ends of the world.’ <span id="fr_2062"></span>[2063](#fn_2062) And
Isaiah speaks as if he were personating the apostles, when they say to
Christ that they believe not in their own report, but in the power of
Him who sent them. And so he says: ‘Lord, who hath believed our report?
and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? We have preached before Him
as if \[He were\] a child, as if a root in a dry ground.’ <span
id="fr_2063"></span>[2064](#fn_2063) (And what follows in order of the
prophecy already quoted. <span id="fr_2064"></span>[2065](#fn_2064) )
But when the passage speaks as from the lips of many, ‘We have preached
before Him,’ and adds, ‘as if a child,’ it signifies that the wicked
shall become subject to Him, and shall obey His command, and that all
shall become as one child. Such a thing as you may witness in the body:
although the members are enumerated as many, all are called *one*, and
are a *body*. For, indeed, a commonwealth and a church, <span
id="fr_2065"></span>[2066](#fn_2065) though many individuals in number,
<span id="page_216">p. 216</span> <span
id="viii.iv.xlii-Page_216"></span> are in fact as one, called and
addressed by one appellation. And in short, sirs,” said I, “by
enumerating all the other appointments of Moses I can demonstrate that
they were types, and symbols, and declarations of those things which
would happen to Christ, of those who it was foreknown were to believe in
Him, and of those things which would also be done by Christ Himself. But
since what I have now enumerated appears to me to be sufficient, I
revert again to the order of the discourse. <span

confounded the bells and gems, which were twelve in number.
