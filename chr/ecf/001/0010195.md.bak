<span id="v.vi.viii"></span>

### <span id="v.vi.viii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VIII.—The same continued.

<span id="v.vi.viii-p1"></span>I therefore did what belonged to me, as a
man devoted to <span id="fr_944"></span>[945](#fn_944.md) unity. For where
there is division and wrath, God doth not dwell. To all them that
repent, the Lord grants forgiveness, if they turn in penitence to the
unity of God, and to communion with the bishop. <span
id="fr_945"></span>[946](#fn_945.md) <span id="v.vi.viii-p3.1"></span><span
id="v.vi.viii-p3.2"></span>I trust \[as to you\] in the grace of Jesus
Christ, who shall free you from every bond. And I exhort you to do
nothing out of strife, but according to the doctrine of Christ. When I
heard some saying, If I do not find it in the ancient <span
id="fr_946"></span>[947](#fn_946.md) Scriptures, I will not believe the
Gospel; on my saying to them, It is written, they answered me, That
remains to be proved. But to me Jesus Christ is in the place of all that
is ancient: His cross, and death, and resurrection, and the faith <span
id="fr_947"></span>[948](#fn_947.md) which is by Him, are undefiled
monuments of antiquity; by which I desire, through your prayers, to be
justified.

<span id="v.vi.viii-p6"></span>I therefore did what belonged to me, as a
man devoted to unity; adding this also, that where there is diversity of
judgment, and wrath, and hatred, God does not dwell. To all them that
repent, God grants forgiveness, if they with one consent return to the
unity of Christ, and communion with the bishop. <span
id="fr_948"></span>[949](#fn_948.md) <span id="v.vi.viii-p7.1"></span><span
id="v.vi.viii-p7.2"></span>I trust to the grace of Jesus Christ, that He
will free you from every bond of wickedness. <span
id="fr_949"></span>[950](#fn_949.md) I therefore exhort you that ye do
nothing out of strife, <span id="fr_950"></span>[951](#fn_950.md) but
according to the doctrine of Christ. For I have heard some saying, If I
do not find the Gospel in the archives, I will not believe it. To such
persons I say that my archives are Jesus Christ, to disobey whom is
manifest destruction. <span id="v.vi.viii-p9.2"></span>My authentic
archives are His cross, and death, and resurrection, and the faith which
bears on these things, by which I desire, through your prayers, to be
justified. He who disbelieves the Gospel disbelieves everything along
with it. For the archives ought not to be preferred to the Spirit. <span
id="fr_951"></span>[952](#fn_951.md) “It is hard to kick against the
pricks;” <span id="fr_952"></span>[953](#fn_952.md) it is hard to
disbelieve Christ; it is hard to reject the preaching of the apostles.
