### <span id="viii.ii.lx-p0.1"></span>Chapter LX.—Plato’s doctrine of the cross.

<span id="viii.ii.lx-p1"></span><span id="viii.ii.lx-p1.1"></span><span
id="viii.ii.lx-p1.2"></span>And the physiological discussion <span
id="fr_1888"></span>[1889](#fn_1888.md) concerning the Son of God in the
*Timæus* of Plato, where he says, “He placed him crosswise <span
id="fr_1889"></span>[1890](#fn_1889.md) in the universe,” he borrowed in
like manner from Moses; for in the writings of Moses it is related how
at that time, when the Israelites went out of Egypt and were in the
wilderness, they fell in with poisonous beasts, both vipers and asps,
and every kind of serpent, which slew the people; and that Moses, by the
inspiration and influence of God, took brass, and made it into the
figure of a cross, and set it in the holy tabernacle, and said to the
people, “If ye look to this figure, and believe, ye shall be saved
thereby.” <span id="fr_1890"></span>[1891](#fn_1890.md) And when this was
done, it is recorded that the serpents died, and it is handed down that
the people thus escaped death. Which things Plato reading, and not
accurately understanding, and not apprehending that it was the figure of
the cross, but taking it to be a placing crosswise, he said that the
power next to the first God was placed crosswise in the universe. And as
to his speaking of a third, he did this because he read, as we said
above, that which was spoken by Moses, “that the Spirit of God moved
over the waters.” For he gives the second place to the Logos which is
with God, who he said was placed crosswise in the universe; and the
third place to the Spirit who was said to be borne upon the water,
saying, “And the third around the third.” <span
id="fr_1891"></span>[1892](#fn_1891.md) And hear how the Spirit of prophecy
signified through Moses that there should be a conflagration. He spoke
thus: “Everlasting fire shall descend, and shall devour to the pit
beneath.” <span id="fr_1892"></span>[1893](#fn_1892.md) It is not, then,
that we hold the same opinions as others, but that all speak in
imitation of ours. Among us these things can be heard and learned from
persons who do not even know the forms of the letters, who are
uneducated and barbarous in speech, though wise and believing in mind;
some, indeed, even maimed and deprived of eyesight; so that you may
understand that these things are not the effect of human wisdom, but are
uttered by the power of God.

<span id="viii.ii.lx-p3"></span> He impressed him as a <span

the form of the letter <span class="Greek"><span

speaking of the soul of the universe. \[Timæus, Opp., vol. ix. p. 314.
And see note of Langus (p. 37) on p. 113 of Grabe. Here crops out the
Platonic philosopher speaking after the fashion of his contemporaries,
perhaps to conciliate his sovereign. See Professor Jowett’s Introduction
to the *Timæus*, which will aid the students.\]
