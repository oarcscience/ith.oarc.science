### <span id="vi.ii.x-p0.1"></span>Chapter X.—Spiritual significance of the precepts of Moses respecting different kinds of food.

<span id="vi.ii.x-p1"></span><span id="vi.ii.x-p1.1"></span>Now,
wherefore did Moses say, “Thou shalt not eat the swine, nor the eagle,
nor the hawk, nor the raven, nor any fish which is not possessed of
scales?” <span id="fr_1574"></span>[1575](#fn_1574) He embraced three
doctrines in his mind \[in doing so\]. Moreover, the Lord saith to them
in Deuteronomy, “And I will establish my ordinances among this
people.” <span id="fr_1575"></span>[1576](#fn_1575) Is there then not a
command of God they should not eat \[these things\]? There is, but Moses
spoke with a spiritual reference. <span
id="fr_1576"></span>[1577](#fn_1576) <span id="vi.ii.x-p4.1"></span>For
this reason he named the swine, as much as to say, “Thou shalt not join
thyself to men who resemble swine.” For when they live in pleasure, they
forget their Lord; but when they come to want, they acknowledge the
Lord. And \[in like manner\] the swine, when it has eaten, does not
recognize its master; but when hungry it cries out, and on receiving
food is quiet again. <span id="vi.ii.x-p4.2"></span>“Neither shalt thou
eat,” says he “the eagle, nor the hawk, nor the kite, nor the raven.”
“Thou shalt not join thyself,” he means, “to such men as know not how to
procure food for themselves by labour and sweat, but seize on that of
others in their iniquity, and although wearing an aspect of simplicity,
are on the watch to plunder others.” <span
id="fr_1577"></span>[1578](#fn_1577) So these birds, while they sit
idle, inquire how they may devour the flesh of others, proving
themselves pests \[to all\] by their wickedness. <span
id="vi.ii.x-p5.1"></span>“And thou shalt not eat,” he says, “the
lamprey, or the polypus, or the cuttlefish.” He means, “Thou shalt not
join thyself or be like to such men as are ungodly to the end, and are
condemned <span id="fr_1578"></span>[1579](#fn_1578) to death.” In like
manner as those fishes, above accursed, float in the deep, not swimming
\[on the surface\] like the rest, but make their abode in the mud which
lies at the bottom. Moreover, “Thou shall not,” he says, “eat the hare.”
Wherefore? “Thou shall not be a corrupter of boys, nor like unto
such.” <span id="fr_1579"></span>[1580](#fn_1579) Because the hare
multiplies, year by year, the places of its conception; for as many
years as it lives so many <span id="fr_1580"></span>[1581](#fn_1580) it
has. Moreover, “Thou shall not eat the hyena.” <span
id="vi.ii.x-p8.2"></span>He means, “Thou shall not be an adulterer, nor
a corrupter, nor be like to them that are such.” Wherefore? Because that
animal annually changes its sex, and is at one time male, and at another
female. Moreover, he has rightly detested the weasel. For he means,
“Thou shalt not be like to those whom we hear of as committing
wickedness with the mouth, <span id="fr_1581"></span>[1582](#fn_1581) on
account of their uncleanness; nor shall thou be joined to those impure
women who commit iniquity with the mouth. For this animal conceives by
the mouth.” Moses then issued <span id="fr_1582"></span>[1583](#fn_1582)
three doctrines concerning meats with a spiritual significance; but they
received them according to fleshly desire, as if he had merely spoken of
\[literal\] meats. David, however, comprehends the knowledge of the
three doctrines, and speaks in like manner: “Blessed is the man who hath
not walked in the counsel of the ungodly,” <span
id="fr_1583"></span>[1584](#fn_1583) even as the fishes \[referred to\]
go in darkness to the depths \[of the sea\]; “and hath not stood in the
way of sinners,” even as those who profess to fear the Lord, but go
astray like swine; “and hath not sat in the seat of scorners,” <span
id="fr_1584"></span>[1585](#fn_1584) even as those birds that lie in
wait for prey. Take a full and firm grasp of this spiritual <span
id="fr_1585"></span>[1586](#fn_1585) knowledge. But Moses says still
further, “Ye shall eat every animal that is cloven-footed and ruminant.”
What does he mean? <span id="vi.ii.x-p13.2"></span>\[The ruminant animal
denotes him\] who, on receiving food, recognizes Him that nourishes him,
and being satisfied by Him, <span id="fr_1586"></span>[1587](#fn_1586)
is visibly made glad. Well spake \[Moses\], having respect to the
commandment. <span id="page_144">p. 144</span> <span
id="vi.ii.x-Page_144"></span> What, then, does he mean? That we ought to
join ourselves to those that fear the Lord, those who meditate in their
heart on the commandment which they have received, those who both utter
the judgments of the Lord and observe them, those who know that
meditation is a work of gladness, and who ruminate <span
id="fr_1587"></span>[1588](#fn_1587) upon the word of the Lord. <span
id="vi.ii.x-p15.1"></span>But what means the cloven-footed? That the
righteous man also walks in this world, yet looks forward to the holy
state <span id="fr_1588"></span>[1589](#fn_1588) \[to come\]. Behold how
well Moses legislated. But how was it possible for them to understand or
comprehend these things? We then, rightly understanding his
commandments, <span id="fr_1589"></span>[1590](#fn_1589) explain them as
the Lord intended. For this purpose He circumcised our ears and our
hearts, that we might understand these things.

<span id="vi.ii.x-p2"></span> Cod. Sin. has “portion,” corrected,
however, as above. See [Lev. xi.](../../../bib/kjv/lev011.htm#000)<span

xiv.](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#000)<span id="vi.ii.x-p2.2"></span>

<span id="fn_1577"></span>[143:1578](0010346.htm#fr_1577) <span
id="vi.ii.x-p4.3"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.x-p5"></span> Cod. Sin. inserts, “and gaze about for
some way of escape on account of their greediness, even as these birds
alone do not procure food for themselves (by labour), but sitting idle,
seek to devour the flesh of others.” The text as above seems preferable:
Hilgenfeld, however, follows the Greek.

<span id="fn_1578"></span>[143:1579](0010346.htm#fr_1578) <span
id="vi.ii.x-p5.2"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.x-p6"></span> Cod. Sin. has, “condemned already.”

<span id="fn_1579"></span>[143:1580](0010346.htm#fr_1579) <span
id="vi.ii.x-p6.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.x-p7"></span> Dressel has a note upon this passage, in
which he refers the words we have rendered, “corrupters of boys,” to
those who by their dissolute lives waste their fortunes, and so entail
destruction on their children; but this does not appear satisfactory.

<span id="vi.ii.x-p8"></span> We have left <span class="Greek"><span

<span id="fn_1581"></span>[143:1582](0010346.htm#fr_1581) <span
id="vi.ii.x-p8.3"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.x-p9"></span> Cod. Sin. has, “with the body through
uncleanness,” and so again in the last clause.

<span id="fn_1582"></span>[143:1583](0010346.htm#fr_1582) <span
id="vi.ii.x-p9.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.x-p10"></span> Cod. Sin. inserts, “having received.”

id="vi.ii.x-p11.2"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.x-p12"></span> Literally, “of the pestilent.”

<span id="fn_1585"></span>[143:1586](0010346.htm#fr_1585) <span
id="vi.ii.x-p12.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.x-p13"></span> Cod. Sin. reads, “perfectly,” instead of
“perfect,” as do most <span class="upper"><span
id="vi.ii.x-p13.1"></span>mss.</span>; but, according to Dressel, we
should read, “have a perfect knowledge concerning the food.” Hilgenfeld
follows the Greek.

<span id="fn_1586"></span>[143:1587](0010346.htm#fr_1586) <span
id="vi.ii.x-p13.3"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.x-p14"></span> Or, “resting upon Him.”

<span id="fn_1587"></span>[144:1588](0010346.htm#fr_1587) <span
id="vi.ii.x-p14.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.x-p15"></span> Cod. Sin. here has the singular, “one who
ruminates.”

<span id="fn_1588"></span>[144:1589](0010346.htm#fr_1588) <span
id="vi.ii.x-p15.2"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.x-p16"></span> Literally, “holy age.”

<span id="fn_1589"></span>[144:1590](0010346.htm#fr_1589) <span
id="vi.ii.x-p16.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.x-p17"></span> Cod. Sin. inserts again, “rightly.”
