<span id="ix.viii.xliii-p1"></span>In <span
id="fr_4886"></span>[4887](#fn_4886.md) these things there was signified by
prophecy that the people, having become transgressors, shall be bound by
the chains of their own sins. But the breaking of the bonds of their own
accord indicates that, upon repentance, they shall be again loosed from
the shackles of sin.
