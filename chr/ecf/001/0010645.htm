<p><a name="viii.vi.xxxv-p1"></A>The time, then, ye men of Greece, is now come, that ye, having been persuaded by the secular histories that Moses and the rest of the prophets were far more ancient than any of those who have been esteemed sages among you, abandon the ancient delusion of your forefathers, and read the divine histories of the prophets, and ascertain from them the true religion; for they do not present to you artful discourses, nor speak speciously and plausibly&#8212;for this is the property of those who wish to rob you of the truth&#8212;but use with simplicity the words and expressions which offer themselves, and declare to you whatever the Holy Ghost, who descended upon them, chose to teach through them to those who are desirous to learn the true religion. Having then laid aside all false shame, and the inveterate error of mankind, with all its bombastic parade and empty noise, though by means of it you fancy you are possessed of all advantages, do you give yourselves to the things that profit you. For neither will you commit any offence against your fathers, if you now show a desire to betake yourselves to that which is quite opposed to their error, since it is likely enough that they  <A NAME="page_288"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 288</FONT></A> <a name="viii.vi.xxxv-Page_288"></A>  themselves are now lamenting in Hades, and repenting with a too late repentance; and if it were possible for them to show you thence what had befallen them after the termination of this life, ye would know from what fearful ills they desired to deliver you. But now, since it is not possible in this present life that ye either learn from them, or from those who here profess to teach that philosophy which is falsely so called, it follows as the one thing that remains for you to do, that, renouncing the error of your fathers, ye read the prophecies of the sacred writers,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2584"></A><A HREF="#fn_2584"><FONT SIZE="1">2585</FONT></A>
 not requiring from them unexceptionable diction (for the matters of our religion lie in works,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2585"></A><A HREF="#fn_2585"><FONT SIZE="1">2586</FONT></A>
 not in words), and learn from them what will give you life everlasting. For those who bootlessly disgrace the name of philosophy are convicted of knowing nothing at all, as they are themselves forced, though unwillingly, to confess, since not only do they disagree with each other, but also expressed their own opinions sometimes in one way, sometimes in another.</p>
