### <span id="viii.iv.xlviii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XLVIII.—Before the divinity of Christ is proved, he \[Trypho\] demands that it be settled that He is Christ.

<span id="viii.iv.xlviii-p1"></span>And Trypho said, “We have heard what
you think of these matters. Resume the discourse where you left off, and
bring it to an end. For some of it appears to me to be paradoxical, and
wholly incapable of proof. For when you say that this Christ existed as
God before the ages, then that He submitted to be born and become man,
yet that He is not man of man, this \[assertion\] appears to me to be
not merely paradoxical, but also foolish.”

<span id="viii.iv.xlviii-p2"></span>And I replied to this, “I know that
the statement does appear to be paradoxical, especially to those of your
race, who are ever unwilling to understand or to perform the
\[requirements\] of God, but \[ready to perform\] those of your
teachers, as God Himself declares. <span
id="fr_2094"></span>[2095](#fn_2094) <span
id="viii.iv.xlviii-p3.2"></span><span
id="viii.iv.xlviii-p3.3"></span><span
id="viii.iv.xlviii-p3.4"></span>Now assuredly, Trypho,” I continued,”
\[the proof\] that this man <span id="fr_2095"></span>[2096](#fn_2095)
is the Christ of God does not fail, though I be unable to prove that He
existed formerly as Son of the Maker of all things, being God, and was
born a man by the Virgin. But since I have certainly proved that this
man is the Christ of God, whoever He be, even if I do not prove that He
pre-existed, and submitted to be born a man of like passions with us,
having a body, according to the Father’s will; in this last matter alone
is it just to say that I have erred, and not to deny that He is the
Christ, though it should appear that He was born man of men, and
\[nothing more\] is proved \[than this\], that He has become Christ by
election. <span id="viii.iv.xlviii-p4.1"></span>For there are some, my
friends,” I said, “of our race, <span
id="fr_2096"></span>[2097](#fn_2096) who admit that He is Christ, while
holding Him to be man of men; with whom I do not agree, nor would
I, <span id="fr_2097"></span>[2098](#fn_2097) even though most of those
who have \[now\] the same opinions as myself should say so; since we
were enjoined by Christ Himself to put no faith in human
doctrines, <span id="fr_2098"></span>[2099](#fn_2098) but in those
proclaimed by the blessed prophets and taught by Himself.”

<span id="viii.iv.xlviii-p5"></span> Some read, “of *your* race,”
referring to the *Ebionites*. Maranus believes the reference is to the
Ebionites, and supports in a long note the reading “our,” inasmuch as
Justin would be more likely to associate these Ebionites with Christians
than with Jews, even though they were heretics.
