### <span id="iv.ii.ix-p0.1"></span>Chapter IX.—Patience inculcated.

<span id="iv.ii.ix-p1"></span><span id="iv.ii.ix-p1.1"></span><span
id="iv.ii.ix-p1.2"></span>I exhort you all, therefore, to yield
obedience to the word of righteousness, and to exercise all patience,
such as ye have seen \[set\] before your eyes, not only in the case of
the blessed Ignatius, and Zosimus, and Rufus, but also in others among
yourselves, and in Paul himself, and the rest of the apostles. \[This
do\] in the assurance that all these have not run <span
id="fr_389"></span>[390](#fn_389.md) in vain, but in faith and
righteousness, and that they are \[now\] in their due place in the
presence of the Lord, with whom also they suffered. For they loved not
this present world, but Him who died for us, and for our sakes was
raised again by God from the dead.
