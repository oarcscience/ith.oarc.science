### <span id="ix.vi.xxvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXVI.—The treasure hid in the Scriptures is Christ; the true exposition of the Scriptures is to be found in the Church alone.

<span id="ix.vi.xxvii-p1"></span>1. <span
id="ix.vi.xxvii-p1.1"></span><span id="ix.vi.xxvii-p1.2"></span>If any
one, therefore, reads the Scriptures with attention, he will find in
them an account of Christ, and a foreshadowing of the new calling
(*vocationis*). For Christ is the treasure which was hid in the
field, <span id="fr_4148"></span>[4149](#fn_4148.md) that is, in this world
(for “the field is the world” <span id="fr_4149"></span>[4150](#fn_4149.md)
); but the treasure hid in the Scriptures is Christ, since He was
pointed out by means of types and parables. Hence His human nature could
not <span id="fr_4150"></span>[4151](#fn_4150.md) be understood, prior to
the consummation of those things which had been predicted, that is, the
advent of Christ. And therefore it was said to Daniel the prophet: “Shut
up the words, and seal the book even to the time of consummation, until
many learn, and knowledge be completed. For at that time, when the
dispersion shall be accomplished, they shall know all these
things.” <span id="fr_4151"></span>[4152](#fn_4151.md) But Jeremiah also
says, “In the last days they shall understand these things.” <span
id="fr_4152"></span>[4153](#fn_4152.md) For every prophecy, before its
fulfilment, is to men \[full of\] enigmas and ambiguities. But when the
time has arrived, and the prediction has come to pass, then the
prophecies have a clear and certain exposition. And for this reason,
indeed, when at this present time the law is read to the Jews, it is
like a fable; for they do not possess the explanation of all things
pertaining to the advent of the Son of God, which took place in human
nature; but when it is read by the Christians, it is a treasure, hid
indeed in a field, but brought to light by the cross of Christ, and
<span id="page_497">p. 497</span> <span
id="ix.vi.xxvii-Page_497"></span> explained, both enriching the
understanding of men, and showing forth the wisdom of God and declaring
His dispensations with regard to man, and forming the kingdom of Christ
beforehand, and preaching by anticipation the inheritance of the holy
Jerusalem, and proclaiming beforehand that the man who loves God shall
arrive at such excellency as even to see God, and hear His word, and
from the hearing of His discourse be glorified to such an extent, that
others cannot behold the glory of his countenance, as was said by
Daniel: “Those who do understand, shall shine as the brightness of the
firmament, and many of the righteous <span
id="fr_4153"></span>[4154](#fn_4153.md) as the stars for ever and
ever.” <span id="fr_4154"></span>[4155](#fn_4154.md) Thus, then, I have
shown it to be, <span id="fr_4155"></span>[4156](#fn_4155.md) if any one
read the Scriptures. For thus it was that the Lord discoursed with the
disciples after His resurrection from the dead, proving to them from the
Scriptures themselves “that Christ must suffer, and enter into His
glory, and that remission of sins should be preached in His name
throughout all the world.” <span id="fr_4156"></span>[4157](#fn_4156.md)
And the disciple will be perfected, and \[rendered\] like the
householder, “who bringeth forth from his treasure things new and
old.” <span id="fr_4157"></span>[4158](#fn_4157.md)

<span id="ix.vi.xxvii-p12"></span>2. <span
id="ix.vi.xxvii-p12.1"></span>Wherefore it is incumbent to obey the
presbyters who are in the Church,—those who, as I have shown, possess
the succession from the apostles; those who, together with the
succession of the episcopate, have received the certain gift of truth,
according to the good pleasure of the Father. But \[it is also
incumbent\] to hold in suspicion others who depart from the primitive
succession, and assemble themselves together in any place whatsoever,
\[looking upon them\] either as heretics of perverse minds, or as
schismatics puffed up and self-pleasing, or again as hypocrites, acting
thus for the sake of lucre and vainglory. For all these have fallen from
the truth. And the heretics, indeed, who bring strange fire to the altar
of God— namely, strange doctrines—shall be burned up by the fire from
heaven, as were Nadab and Abiud. <span
id="fr_4158"></span>[4159](#fn_4158.md) But such as rise up in opposition
to the truth, and exhort others against the Church of God, \[shall\]
remain among those in hell (*apud inferos*), being swallowed up by an
earthquake, even as those who were with Chore, Dathan, and Abiron. <span
id="fr_4159"></span>[4160](#fn_4159.md) <span
id="ix.vi.xxvii-p14.2"></span>But those who cleave asunder, and separate
the unity of the Church, \[shall\] receive from God the same punishment
as Jeroboam did. <span id="fr_4160"></span>[4161](#fn_4160.md)

<span id="ix.vi.xxvii-p16"></span>3. <span
id="ix.vi.xxvii-p16.1"></span>Those, however, who are believed to be
presbyters by many, but serve their own lusts, and, do not place the
fear of God supreme in their hearts, but conduct themselves with
contempt towards others, and are puffed up with the pride of holding the
chief seat, and work evil deeds in secret, saying, “No man sees us,”
shall be convicted by the Word, who does not judge after outward
appearance (*secundum gloriam*), nor looks upon the countenance, but the
heart; and they shall hear those words, to be found in Daniel the
prophet: “O thou seed of Canaan, and not of Judah, beauty hath deceived
thee, and lust perverted thy heart. <span
id="fr_4161"></span>[4162](#fn_4161.md) Thou that art waxen old in wicked
days, now thy sins which thou hast committed aforetime are come to
light; for thou hast pronounced false judgments, and hast been
accustomed to condemn the innocent, and to let the guilty go free,
albeit the Lord saith, The innocent and the righteous shalt thou not
slay.” <span id="fr_4162"></span>[4163](#fn_4162.md) Of whom also did the
Lord say: “But if the evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord
delayeth his coming, and shall begin to smite the man-servants and
maidens, and to eat and drink and be drunken; the lord of that servant
shall come in a day that he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he
is not aware of, and shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion
with the unbelievers.” <span id="fr_4163"></span>[4164](#fn_4163.md)

<span id="ix.vi.xxvii-p20"></span>4. <span
id="ix.vi.xxvii-p20.1"></span>From all such persons, therefore, it
behoves us to keep aloof, but to adhere to those who, as I have already
observed, do hold the doctrine of the apostles, and who, together with
the order of priesthood (*presbyterii ordine*), display sound speech and
blameless conduct for the confirmation and correction of others. <span
id="fr_4164"></span>[4165](#fn_4164.md) In this way, Moses, to whom such a
leadership was entrusted, relying on a good conscience, cleared himself
before God, saying, “I have not in covetousness taken anything belonging
to one of these men, nor have I done evil to one of them.” <span
id="fr_4165"></span>[4166](#fn_4165.md) In this way, too, Samuel, who
judged the people so many years, and bore rule over Israel without any
pride, in the end cleared himself, saying, “I have walked before you
from my childhood even unto this day: answer me in the sight of God, and
before His anointed (*Christi ejus*); whose ox or whose ass of yours
have I taken, or over whom have I tyrannized, or whom have I oppressed?
or if I have received from the hand of any a bribe or \[so much as\] a
shoe, speak out <span id="page_498">p. 498</span> <span
id="ix.vi.xxvii-Page_498"></span> against me, and I will restore it to
you.” <span id="fr_4166"></span>[4167](#fn_4166.md) And when the people had
said to him, “Thou hast not tyrannized, neither hast thou oppressed us
neither hast thou taken ought of any man’s hand,” he called the Lord to
witness, saying, “The Lord is witness, and His Anointed is witness this
day, that ye have not found ought in my hand. And they said to him, He
is witness.” In this strain also the Apostle Paul, inasmuch as he had a
good conscience, said to the Corinthians: “For we are not as many, who
corrupt the Word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the
sight of God speak we in Christ;” <span
id="fr_4167"></span>[4168](#fn_4167.md) “We have injured no man, corrupted
no man, circumvented no man.” <span id="fr_4168"></span>[4169](#fn_4168.md)

<span id="ix.vi.xxvii-p26"></span>5. Such presbyters does the Church
nourish, of whom also the prophet says: “I will give thy rulers in
peace, and thy bishops in righteousness.” <span
id="fr_4169"></span>[4170](#fn_4169.md) Of whom also did the Lord declare,
“Who then shall be a faithful steward (*actor*), good and wise, whom the
Lord sets over His household, to give them their meat in due season?
Blessed is that servant whom his Lord, when He cometh, shall find so
doing.” <span id="fr_4170"></span>[4171](#fn_4170.md) Paul then, teaching
us where one may find such, says, “God hath placed in the Church, first,
apostles; secondly, prophets; thirdly, teachers.” <span
id="fr_4171"></span>[4172](#fn_4171.md) Where, therefore, the gifts of the
Lord have been placed, there it behoves us to learn the truth,
\[namely,\] from those who possess that succession of the Church which
is from the apostles, <span id="fr_4172"></span>[4173](#fn_4172.md) and
among whom exists that which is sound and blameless in conduct, as well
as that which is unadulterated and incorrupt in speech. For these also
preserve this faith of ours in one God who created all things; and they
increase that love \[which we have\] for the Son of God, who
accomplished such marvellous dispensations for our sake: and they
expound the Scriptures to us without danger, neither blaspheming God,
nor dishonouring the patriarchs, nor despising the prophets.
