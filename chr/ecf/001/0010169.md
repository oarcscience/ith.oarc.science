<span id="v.iv.vii"></span>

### <span id="v.iv.vii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VII.—The same continued.

<span id="v.iv.vii-p1"></span>Be on your guard, therefore, against such
persons. <span id="v.iv.vii-p1.1"></span>And this will be the case with
you if you are not puffed up, and continue in intimate union with <span
id="fr_765"></span>[766](#fn_765) Jesus Christ our God, and the <span
id="page_69">p. 69</span> <span id="v.iv.vii-Page_69"></span> bishop,
and the enactments of the apostles. He that is within the altar is pure,
but <span id="fr_766"></span>[767](#fn_766) he that is without is not
pure; that is, he who does anything apart from the bishop, and
presbytery, and deacons, <span id="fr_767"></span>[768](#fn_767) such a
man is not pure in his conscience.

<span id="v.iv.vii-p5"></span>Be on your guard, therefore, against such
persons, that ye admit not of a snare for your own souls. And act so
that your life shall be without offence to all men, lest ye become as “a
snare upon a watch-tower, and as a net which is spread out.” <span
id="fr_768"></span>[769](#fn_768) For “he that does not heal himself in
his own works, is the brother of him that destroys himself.” <span
id="fr_769"></span>[770](#fn_769) <span id="v.iv.vii-p7.2"></span>If,
therefore, ye also put away conceit, arrogance, disdain, and
haughtiness, it will be your privilege to be inseparably united to God,
for “He is nigh unto those that fear Him.” <span
id="fr_770"></span>[771](#fn_770) And says He, “Upon whom will I look,
but upon him that is humble and quiet, and that trembles at my
words?” <span id="fr_771"></span>[772](#fn_771) And do ye also reverence
your bishop as Christ Himself, according as the blessed apostles have
enjoined you. He that is within the altar is pure, wherefore also he is
obedient to the bishop and presbyters: but he that is without is one
that does anything apart from the bishop, the presbyters, and the
deacons. Such a person is defiled in his conscience, and is worse than
an infidel. <span id="v.iv.vii-p9.2"></span>For what is the bishop but
one who beyond all others possesses all power and authority, so far as
it is possible for a man to possess it, who according to his ability has
been made an imitator of the Christ of God? <span
id="fr_772"></span>[773](#fn_772) <span id="v.iv.vii-p10.1"></span>And
what is the presbytery but a sacred assembly, the counsellors and
assessors of the bishop? <span id="v.iv.vii-p10.2"></span><span
id="v.iv.vii-p10.3"></span>And what are the deacons but imitators of the
angelic powers, <span id="fr_773"></span>[774](#fn_773) fulfilling a
pure and blameless ministry unto him, as the holy Stephen did to the
blessed James, Timothy and Linus to Paul, Anencletus and Clement to
Peter? He, therefore, that will not yield obedience to such, must needs
be one utterly without God, an impious man who despises Christ, and
depreciates His appointments.
