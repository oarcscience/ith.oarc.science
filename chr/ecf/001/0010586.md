### <span id="viii.iv.cxxv-p0.1"></span>Chapter CXXV.—He explains what force the word Israel has, and how it suits Christ.

<span id="viii.iv.cxxv-p1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.cxxv-p1.1"></span><span id="viii.iv.cxxv-p1.2"></span>“I
wish, sirs,” I said, “to learn from you what is the force of the name
Israel.” And as they were silent, I continued: “I shall tell you what I
know: for I do not think it right, when I know, not to speak; or,
suspecting that you do know, and yet from envy or from voluntary
ignorance deceive yourselves, <span id="fr_2434"></span>[2435](#fn_2434.md)
to be continually solicitous; but I speak all things simply and
candidly, as my Lord said: ‘A sower went forth to sow the seed; and some
fell by the wayside; and some among thorns, and some on stony ground,
and some on good ground.’ <span id="fr_2435"></span>[2436](#fn_2435.md) I
must speak, then, in the hope of finding good ground somewhere; since
that Lord of mine, as One strong and powerful, comes to demand back His
own from all, and will not condemn His steward if He recognises that he,
by the knowledge that the Lord is powerful and has come to demand His
own, has given it to every bank, and has not digged for any cause
whatsoever. Accordingly the name Israel signifies this, A man who
overcomes power; for *Isra* is a man overcoming, and *El* is
power. <span id="fr_2436"></span>[2437](#fn_2436.md) And that Christ would
act so when He became man was foretold by the mystery of Jacob’s
wrestling with Him who appeared to him, in that He ministered to the
will of the Father, yet nevertheless is God, in that He is the
first-begotten of all creatures. For when He became man, as I previously
remarked, the devil came to Him—i.e., that power which is called the
serpent and Satan—tempting Him, and striving to effect His downfall by
asking Him to worship him. But He destroyed and overthrew the devil,
having proved him to be wicked, in that he asked to be worshipped as
God, contrary to the Scripture; who is an apostate from the will of God.
For He answers him, ‘It is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God,
and Him only shall thou serve.’ <span
id="fr_2437"></span>[2438](#fn_2437.md) Then, overcome and convicted, the
devil departed at that time. But since our Christ was to be numbed,
i.e., by pain and experience of suffering, He made a previous intimation
of this by touching Jacob’s thigh, and causing it to shrink. But Israel
was His name from the beginning, to which He altered the name of the
blessed Jacob when He blessed him with His own name, proclaiming thereby
that all who through Him have fled for refuge to the Father, constitute
the blessed Israel. But you, having understood none of this, and not
being prepared to understand, since you are the children of Jacob after
the fleshly seed, expect that you shall be assuredly saved. But that you
deceive yourselves in such matters, I have proved by many words.
