 succeeded to the empire of the Romans, Ignatius, the disciple of John the apostle, a man in all respects of an apostolic character, governed the Church of the Antiochians with great care, having with difficulty escaped the former storms of the many persecutions under Domitian, inasmuch as, like a good pilot, by the helm of prayer and fasting, by the earnestness of his teaching, and by his [constant&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1399"></A><A HREF="#fn_1399"><FONT SIZE="1">1400</FONT></A>
] spiritual labour, he resisted the flood that rolled against him, fearing [only] lest he should lose any of those who were deficient in courage, or apt to suffer from their simplicity.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1400"></A><A HREF="#fn_1400"><FONT SIZE="1">1401</FONT></A>

For he inwardly reflected, that the confession which is made by martyrdom, would bring him into a yet more intimate relation to the Lord. Wherefore, continuing a few years longer with the Church, and, like a divine lamp, enlightening every one&#146;s understanding by his expositions of the [Holy&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1401"></A><A HREF="#fn_1401"><FONT SIZE="1">1402</FONT></A>
] Scriptures, he [at length] attained the object of his desire.</p>
