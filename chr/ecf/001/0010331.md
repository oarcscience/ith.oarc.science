### <span id="v.xxv.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.—Ignatius is brought to Rome.

<span id="v.xxv.v-p1"></span><span id="v.xxv.v-p1.1"></span>Having
therefore, by means of this Epistle, settled, <span
id="fr_1420"></span>[1421](#fn_1420.md) as he wished, those of the brethren
at Rome who were unwilling \[for his martyrdom\]; and setting sail from
Smyrna (for Christophorus was pressed by the soldiers to hasten to the
public spectacles in the mighty \[city\] Rome, that, being given up to
the wild beasts in the sight of the Roman people, he might attain to the
crown for which he strove), he \[next\] landed at Troas. Then, going on
from that place to Neapolis, he went \[on foot\] by Philippi through
Macedonia, and on to that part of Epirus which is near Epidamnus; and
finding a ship in one of the seaports, he sailed over the Adriatic Sea,
and entering from it on the Tyrrhene, he passed by the various islands
and cities, until, when Puteoli came in sight, he was eager there to
disembark, having a desire to tread in the footsteps of the Apostle
Paul. <span id="fr_1421"></span>[1422](#fn_1421.md) But a violent wind
arising did not suffer him to do so, the ship being driven rapidly
forwards; <span id="fr_1422"></span>[1423](#fn_1422.md) and, simply
expressing his delight <span id="fr_1423"></span>[1424](#fn_1423.md) over
the love of the brethren in that place, he sailed by. Wherefore,
continuing to enjoy fair winds, we were reluctantly hurried on in one
day and a night, mourning \[as we did\] over the coming departure from
us of this righteous man. But to him this happened just as he wished,
since he was in haste as soon as possible to leave this world, that he
might attain to the Lord whom he loved. Sailing then into the Roman
harbour, and the unhallowed sports being just about to close, the
soldiers began to be annoyed at our slowness, but the bishop rejoicingly
yielded to their urgency.
