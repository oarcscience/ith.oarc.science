### <span id="viii.ii.lxvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter LXVI.—Of the Eucharist.

<span id="viii.ii.lxvi-p1"></span><span
id="viii.ii.lxvi-p1.1"></span><span id="viii.ii.lxvi-p1.2"></span>And
this food is called among us <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.ii.lxvi-p1.3"></span>Εὐχαριστία</span> <span
id="fr_1909"></span>[1910](#fn_1909) \[the Eucharist\], of which no one
is allowed to partake but the man who believes that the things which we
teach are true, and who has been washed with the washing that is for the
remission of sins, and unto regeneration, and who is so living as Christ
has enjoined. <span id="viii.ii.lxvi-p2.2"></span>For not as common
bread and common drink do we receive these; but in like manner as Jesus
Christ our Saviour, having been made flesh by the Word of God, had both
flesh and blood for our salvation, so likewise have we been taught that
the food which is blessed by the prayer of His word, and from which our
blood and flesh by transmutation are nourished, is the flesh and blood
of that Jesus who was made flesh. <span
id="fr_1910"></span>[1911](#fn_1910) For the apostles, in the memoirs
composed by them, which are called Gospels, have thus delivered unto us
what was enjoined upon them; that Jesus took bread, and when He had
given thanks, said, “This do ye in remembrance of Me, <span
id="fr_1911"></span>[1912](#fn_1911) this is My body;” and that, after
the same manner, having taken the cup and given thanks, He said, “This
is My blood;” and gave it to them alone. Which the wicked devils have
imitated in the mysteries of Mithras, commanding the same thing to be
done. For, that bread and a cup of water are placed with certain
incantations in the mystic rites of one who is being initiated, you
either know or can learn.

<span id="viii.ii.lxvi-p2"></span> Literally, thanksgiving. See [Matt.
xxvi. 27](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#027)<span
id="viii.ii.lxvi-p2.1"></span>.

<span id="fn_1910"></span>[185:1911](0010439.htm#fr_1910) <span
id="viii.ii.lxvi-p2.3"></span>

<span id="viii.ii.lxvi-p3"></span> This passage is claimed alike by
Calvinists, Lutherans, and Romanists; and, indeed, the language is so
inexact, that each party may plausibly maintain that their own opinion
is advocated by it. \[But the same might be said of the words of our
Lord himself; and, if such widely separated Christians can all adopt
this passage, who can be sorry?\] The expression, “the prayer of His
word,” or of the word we have from Him, seems to signify the prayer
pronounced over the elements, in imitation of our Lord’s thanksgiving
before breaking the bread. \[I must dissent from the opinion that the
language is “inexact:” he expresses himself naturally as one who
believes it is bread, but yet not “common bread.” So Gelasius, Bishop of
Rome (<span class="upper"><span
id="viii.ii.lxvi-p3.1"></span>a.d.</span> 490), “By the sacraments we
are made partakers of the divine nature, and yet the substance and
nature of bread and wine do not cease to be in them,” etc. (See original
in *Bingham’s Antiquities*, book xv. cap. 5. See Chryost., *Epist. ad.
Cæsarium*, tom. iii. p. 753. Ed. Migne.) Those desirous to pursue this
inquiry will find the Patristic authorities in *Historia
Transubstantionis Papalis*, etc., *Edidit* F. Meyrick, Oxford, 1858. The
famous tractate of Ratranin (<span class="upper"><span
id="viii.ii.lxvi-p3.2"></span>a.d.</span> 840) was published at Oxford,
1838, with the homily of Ælfric (<span class="upper"><span
id="viii.ii.lxvi-p3.3"></span>a.d.</span> 960) in a cheap edition.\]
