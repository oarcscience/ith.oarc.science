### <span id="ii.ii.xlii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XLII.—The order of ministers in the Church.

<span id="ii.ii.xlii-p1"></span><span id="ii.ii.xlii-p1.1"></span><span
id="ii.ii.xlii-p1.2"></span><span id="ii.ii.xlii-p1.3"></span><span
id="ii.ii.xlii-p1.4"></span>The apostles have preached the Gospel to us
from <span id="fr_177"></span>[178](#fn_177.md) the Lord Jesus Christ;
Jesus Christ \[has done so\] from <span
id="fr_178"></span>[179](#fn_178.md) God. Christ therefore was sent forth
by God, and the apostles by Christ. Both these appointments, <span
id="fr_179"></span>[180](#fn_179.md) then, were made in an orderly way,
according to the will of God. Having therefore received their orders,
and being fully assured by the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ,
and established <span id="fr_180"></span>[181](#fn_180.md) in the word of
God, with full assurance of the Holy Ghost, they went forth proclaiming
that the kingdom of God was at hand. And thus preaching through
countries and cities, they appointed the first-fruits \[of their
labours\], having first proved them by the Spirit, <span
id="fr_181"></span>[182](#fn_181.md) to be bishops and deacons of those who
should afterwards believe. Nor was this any new thing, since indeed many
ages before it was written concerning bishops and deacons. For thus
saith the Scripture in a certain place, “I will appoint their
bishops <span id="fr_182"></span>[183](#fn_182.md) in righteousness, and
their deacons <span id="fr_183"></span>[184](#fn_183.md) in faith.” <span
id="fr_184"></span>[185](#fn_184.md)
