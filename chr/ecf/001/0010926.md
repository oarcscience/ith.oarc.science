<span id="ix.viii.li-p1"></span>Now, <span
id="fr_4900"></span>[4901](#fn_4900.md) however, inasmuch as the books of
these men may possibly have escaped your observation, but have come
under our notice, I call your attention to them, that for the sake of
your reputation you may expel these writings from among you, as bringing
disgrace upon you, since their author boasts himself as being one of
your company. For they constitute a stumbling-block to many, who simply
and unreservedly receive, as coming from a presbyter, the blasphemy
which they utter against God. Just \[consider\] the writer of these
things, how by means of them he does not injure assistants \[in divine
service\] only, who happen to be prepared in mind for blasphemies
against God, but also damages those among us, since by his books he
imbues their minds with false doctrines concerning God.

thus introduced: “And Irenæus Bp. of Lyons, to Victor Bp. of Rome,
concerning Florinus, a presbyter, who was a partisan of the error of
Valentinus, and published an abominable book, thus wrote.”
