### <span id="ii.ii.xxix-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXIX.—Let us also draw near to God in purity of heart.

<span id="ii.ii.xxix-p1"></span><span id="ii.ii.xxix-p1.1"></span><span
id="ii.ii.xxix-p1.2"></span>Let us then draw near to Him with holiness
of spirit, lifting up pure and undefiled hands unto Him, loving our
gracious and merciful Father, who has made us partakers in the blessings
of His elect. <span id="fr_116"></span>[117](#fn_116) For thus it is
written, “When the Most High divided the nations, when He
scattered <span id="fr_117"></span>[118](#fn_117) the sons of Adam, He
fixed the bounds of the nations according to the number of the angels of
God. <span id="ii.ii.xxix-p3.1"></span>His people Jacob became the
portion of the Lord, and Israel the lot of His <span id="page_13">p.
13</span> <span id="ii.ii.xxix-Page_13"></span> inheritance.” <span
id="fr_118"></span>[119](#fn_118) And in another place \[the Scripture\]
saith, “Behold, the Lord taketh unto Himself a nation out of the midst
of the nations, as a man takes the first-fruits of his threshing-floor;
and from that nation shall come forth the Most Holy.” <span
id="fr_119"></span>[120](#fn_119)
