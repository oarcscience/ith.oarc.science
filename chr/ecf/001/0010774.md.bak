### <span id="ix.iv.viii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VII.—Reply to an objection founded on the words of St. Paul ([2 Cor. iv. 4](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#004)<span id="ix.iv.viii-p0.2"></span>.md). St. Paul occasionally uses words not in their grammatical sequence.

<span id="ix.iv.viii-p1"></span>1. <span
id="ix.iv.viii-p1.1"></span><span id="ix.iv.viii-p1.2"></span>As to
their affirming that Paul said plainly in the Second \[Epistle\] to the
Corinthians, “In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of
them that believe not,” <span id="fr_3357"></span>[3358](#fn_3357.md) and
maintaining that there is indeed one god of this world, but another who
is beyond all principality, and beginning, and power, we are not to
blame if they, who give out that they do themselves know mysteries
beyond God, know not how to read Paul. For if any one read the passage
thus—according to Paul’s custom, as I show elsewhere, and by many
examples, that he uses transposition of words—“In whom God,” then
pointing it off, and making a slight interval, and at the same time read
also the rest \[of the sentence\] in one \[clause\], “hath blinded the
minds of them of this world that believe not,” he shall find out the
true \[sense\]; that it is contained in the expression, “God hath
blinded the minds of the unbelievers of this world.” And this is shown
by means of the little interval \[between the clause\]. For Paul does
not say, “the God of this world,” as if recognising any other beyond
Him; but he confessed God as indeed God. And he says, “the unbelievers
of this world,” because they shall not inherit the future age of
incorruption. I shall show from Paul himself, how it is that God has
blinded the minds of them that believe not, in the course of this work,
that we may not just at present distract our mind from the matter in
hand, \[by wandering\] at large.

<span id="ix.iv.viii-p3"></span>2. <span
id="ix.iv.viii-p3.1"></span>From many other instances also, we may
discover that the apostle frequently uses a transposed order in his
sentences, due to the rapidity of his discourses, and the impetus of the
Spirit which is in him. An example occurs in the \[Epistle\] to the
Galatians, where he expresses himself as follows: “Wherefore then the
law of works? <span id="fr_3358"></span>[3359](#fn_3358.md) It was added,
until the seed should come to whom the promise was made; \[and it was\]
ordained by angels in the hand of a Mediator.” <span
id="fr_3359"></span>[3360](#fn_3359.md) For the order of the words runs
thus: “Wherefore then the law of works? Ordained by angels in the hand
of a Mediator, it was added until the seed should come to whom the
promise was made,”— man thus asking the question, and the Spirit making
answer. And again, in the Second to the Thessalonians, speaking of
Antichrist, he says, “And then shall that wicked be revealed, whom the
Lord Jesus Christ <span id="fr_3360"></span>[3361](#fn_3360.md) shall slay
with the Spirit of His mouth, and shall destroy him <span
id="fr_3361"></span>[3362](#fn_3361.md) with the presence of his coming;
\[even him\] whose coming is after the working of Satan, with all power,
and signs, and lying wonders.” <span
id="fr_3362"></span>[3363](#fn_3362.md) Now in these \[sentences\] the
order of the words is this: “And then shall be revealed that wicked,
whose coming is after the working of Satan, with all power, and signs,
and lying wonders, whom <span id="page_421">p. 421</span> <span
id="ix.iv.viii-Page_421"></span> the Lord Jesus shall slay with the
Spirit of His mouth, and shall destroy with the presence of His coming.”
For he does not mean that the coming of the Lord is after the working of
Satan; but the coming of the wicked one, whom we also call Antichrist.
If, then, one does not attend to the \[proper\] reading \[of the
passage\], and if he do not exhibit the intervals of breathing as they
occur, there shall be not only incongruities, but also, when reading, he
will utter blasphemy, as if the advent of the Lord could take place
according to the working of Satan. So therefore, in such passages, the
*hyperbaton* must be exhibited by the reading, and the apostle’s meaning
following on, preserved; and thus we do not read in that passage, “the
god of this world,” but, “God,” whom we do truly call God; and we hear
\[it declared of\] the unbelieving and the blinded of this world, that
they shall not inherit the world of life which is to come.
