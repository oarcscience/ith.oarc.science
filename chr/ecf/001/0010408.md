### <span id="viii.ii.xxxv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXV.—Other fulfilled prophecies.

<span id="viii.ii.xxxv-p1"></span><span
id="viii.ii.xxxv-p1.1"></span>And how Christ after He was born was to
escape the notice of other men until He grew to man’s estate, which also
came to pass, hear what was foretold regarding this. <span
id="viii.ii.xxxv-p1.2"></span><span id="viii.ii.xxxv-p1.3"></span>There
are the following predictions: <span
id="fr_1833"></span>[1834](#fn_1833) —“Unto us a child is born, and unto
us a young man is given, and the government shall be upon His
shoulders;” <span id="fr_1834"></span>[1835](#fn_1834) which is
significant of the power of the cross, for to it, when He was crucified,
He applied His shoulders, as shall be more clearly made out in the
ensuing discourse. And again the same prophet Isaiah, being inspired by
the prophetic Spirit, said, “I have spread out my hands to a disobedient
and gainsaying people, to those who walk in a way that is not good. They
now ask of me judgment, and dare to draw near to God.” <span
id="fr_1835"></span>[1836](#fn_1835) And again in other words, through
another prophet, He says, “They pierced My hands and My feet, and for My
vesture they cast lots.” <span id="fr_1836"></span>[1837](#fn_1836) And
indeed David, the king and prophet, who uttered these things, suffered
none of them; but Jesus Christ stretched forth His hands, being
crucified by the Jews speaking against Him, and denying that He was the
Christ. And as the prophet spoke, they tormented Him, and set Him on the
judgment-seat, and said, Judge us. And the expression, “They pierced my
hands and my feet,” was used in reference to the nails of the cross
which were fixed in His hands and feet. And after He was crucified they
cast lots upon His vesture, and they <span id="page_175">p. 175</span>
<span id="viii.ii.xxxv-Page_175"></span> that crucified Him parted it
among them. And that these things did happen, you can ascertain from the
Acts of Pontius Pilate. <span id="fr_1837"></span>[1838](#fn_1837) <span
id="viii.ii.xxxv-p6.2"></span>And we will cite the prophetic utterances
of another prophet, Zephaniah, <span
id="fr_1838"></span>[1839](#fn_1838) to the effect that He was foretold
expressly as to sit upon the foal of an ass and to enter Jerusalem. The
words are these: “Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter
of Jerusalem: behold, thy King cometh unto thee; lowly, and riding upon
an ass, and upon a colt the foal of an ass.” <span
id="fr_1839"></span>[1840](#fn_1839)

<span id="viii.ii.xxxv-p2"></span> These predictions have so little
reference to the point Justin intends to make out, that some editors
have supposed that a passage has here been lost. Others think the
irrelevancy an insufficient ground for such a supposition. \[See below,
cap. xl.\]

<span id="viii.ii.xxxv-p6"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.ii.xxxv-p6.1"></span>ἄκτων</span>. These Acts of Pontius
Pilate, or regular accounts of his procedure sent by Pilate to the
Emperor Tiberius, are supposed to have been destroyed at an early
period, possibly in consequence of the unanswerable appeals which the
Christians constantly made to them. There exists a forgery in imitation
of these Acts. See Trollope.

<span id="viii.ii.xxxv-p7"></span> The reader will notice that these are
not the words of Zephaniah, but of Zechariah (ix. 9), to whom also
Justin himself refers them in the *Dial. Tryph.*, c. 53. \[Might be
corrected in the text, therefore, as a clerical slip of the pen.\]
