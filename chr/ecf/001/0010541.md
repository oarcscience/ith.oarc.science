### <span id="viii.iv.lxxx-p0.1"></span>Chapter LXXX.—The opinion of Justin with regard to the reign of a thousand years. Several Catholics reject it.

<span id="viii.iv.lxxx-p1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.lxxx-p1.1"></span>And Trypho to this replied, “I remarked to
you sir, that you are very anxious to be safe in all respects, since you
cling to the Scriptures. But tell me, do you really admit that this
place, Jerusalem, shall be rebuilt; and do you expect your people to be
gathered together, and made joyful with Christ and the patriarchs, and
the prophets, both the men of our nation, and other proselytes who
joined them before your Christ came? or have you given way, and admitted
this in order to have the appearance of worsting us in the
controversies?”

<span id="viii.iv.lxxx-p2"></span>Then I answered, “I am not so
miserable a fellow, Trypho, as to say one thing and think another. I
admitted to you formerly, <span id="fr_2257"></span>[2258](#fn_2257.md)
that I and many others are of this opinion, and \[believe\] that such
will take place, as you assuredly are aware; <span
id="fr_2258"></span>[2259](#fn_2258.md) but, on the other hand, I signified
to you that many who belong to the pure and pious faith, and are true
Christians, think otherwise. Moreover, I pointed out to you that some
who are called Christians, but are godless, impious heretics, teach
doctrines that are in every way blasphemous, atheistical, and foolish.
But that you may know that I do not say this before you alone, I shall
draw up a statement, so far as I can, of all the arguments which have
passed between us; in which I shall record myself as admitting the very
same things which I admit to you. <span
id="fr_2259"></span>[2260](#fn_2259.md) For I choose to follow not men or
men’s doctrines, but God and the doctrines \[delivered\] by Him. For if
you have fallen in with some who are called Christians, but who do not
admit this \[truth\], <span id="fr_2260"></span>[2261](#fn_2260.md) and
venture to blaspheme the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the
God of Jacob; who say there is no resurrection of the dead, and that
their souls, when they die, are taken to heaven; do not imagine that
they are Christians, even as one, if he would rightly consider it, would
not admit that the Sadducees, or similar sects of Genistæ,
Meristæ, <span id="fr_2261"></span>[2262](#fn_2261.md) Galilæans,
Hellenists, <span id="fr_2262"></span>[2263](#fn_2262.md) Pharisees,
Baptists, are Jews (do not hear me impatiently when I tell you what I
think), but are \[only\] called Jews and children of Abraham,
worshipping God with the lips, as God Himself declared, but the heart
was far from Him. But I and others, who are right-minded Christians on
all points, are assured that there will be a resurrection of the dead,
and a thousand years <span id="fr_2263"></span>[2264](#fn_2263.md) in
Jerusalem, which will then be built, adorned, and enlarged, \[as\] the
prophets Ezekiel and Isaiah and others declare.

<span id="viii.iv.lxxx-p3"></span> Justin made no previous allusion to
this point, so far as we know from the writing preserved.

<span id="fn_2258"></span>[239:2259](0010541.htm#fr_2258.md) <span
id="viii.iv.lxxx-p3.1"></span>

<span id="viii.iv.lxxx-p4"></span> Or, “so as to believe thoroughly that
such will take place” (after “opinion”).

<span id="fn_2260"></span>[239:2261](0010541.htm#fr_2260.md) <span
id="viii.iv.lxxx-p5.1"></span>

<span id="viii.iv.lxxx-p6"></span> i.e., resurrection.

<span id="fn_2261"></span>[239:2262](0010541.htm#fr_2261.md) <span
id="viii.iv.lxxx-p6.1"></span>

<span id="viii.iv.lxxx-p7"></span> Maranus says, Hieron. thinks the
*Genistæ* were so called because they were sprung from Abraham (<span
class="Greek"><span id="viii.iv.lxxx-p7.1"></span>γένος</span>) the
*Meristæ* so called because they separated the Scriptures. Josephus
bears testimony to the fact that the sects of the Jews differed in
regard to fate and providence; the Pharisees submitting all things
indeed to God, with the exception of human will; the Essenes making no
exceptions, and submitting all to God. I believe therefore that the
*Genistæ* were so called because they believed the world to in general
governed by God; the *Meristæ*, because they believed that a fate or
providence belonged to each man.

<span id="fn_2262"></span>[239:2263](0010541.htm#fr_2262.md) <span
id="viii.iv.lxxx-p7.2"></span>

<span id="viii.iv.lxxx-p8"></span> Otto says, the author and chief of
this sect of *Galilæans* was Judas Galilæus, who, after the exile of
king Archelaus, when the Romans wished to raise a tax in Judæa, excited
his countrymen to the retaining of their former liberty.—The
*Hellenists*, or rather *Hellenæans*. No one mentions this sect but
Justin; perhaps *Herodians* or *Hillelæans* (from R. Hillel).

<span id="fn_2263"></span>[239:2264](0010541.htm#fr_2263.md) <span
id="viii.iv.lxxx-p8.1"></span>

<span id="viii.iv.lxxx-p9"></span> We have translated the text of Justin
as it stands. Commentators make the sense, “and that there will be a
thousand years in Jerusalem,” or “that the saints will live a thousand
years in Jerusalem.”
