### <span id="ii.ii.xli-p0.1"></span>Chapter XLI.—Continuation of the same subject.

<span id="ii.ii.xli-p1"></span><span id="ii.ii.xli-p1.1"></span><span
id="ii.ii.xli-p1.2"></span><span id="ii.ii.xli-p1.3"></span>Let every
one of you, brethren, give thanks to God in his own order, living in all
good conscience, with becoming gravity, and not going beyond the rule of
the ministry prescribed to him. Not in every place, brethren, are the
daily sacrifices offered, or the peace-offerings, or the sin-offerings
and the trespass-offerings, but in Jerusalem only. And even there they
are not offered in any place, but only at the altar before the temple,
that which is offered being first carefully examined by the high priest
and the ministers already mentioned. Those, therefore, who do anything
beyond that which is agreeable to His will, are punished with death. Ye
see, <span id="fr_176"></span>[177](#fn_176.md) brethren, that the greater
the knowledge that has been vouchsafed to us, the greater also is the
danger to which we are exposed.

Jerusalem may be an ideal present.\]
