### <span id="ii.ii.xlviii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XLVIII.—Let us return to the practice of brotherly love.

<span id="ii.ii.xlviii-p1"></span><span
id="ii.ii.xlviii-p1.1"></span><span id="ii.ii.xlviii-p1.2"></span><span
id="ii.ii.xlviii-p1.3"></span>Let us therefore, with all haste, put an
end <span id="fr_217"></span>[218](#fn_217) to this \[state of things\];
and let us fall down before the Lord, and beseech Him with tears, that
He would mercifully <span id="fr_218"></span>[219](#fn_218) be
reconciled to us, and restore us to our former seemly and holy practice
of brotherly love. For \[such conduct\] is the gate of righteousness,
which is set open for the attainment of life, as it is written, “Open to
me the gates of righteousness; I will go in by them, and will praise the
Lord: this is the gate of the Lord: the righteous shall enter in by
it.” <span id="fr_219"></span>[220](#fn_219) Although, therefore, many
gates have been set open, yet this gate of righteousness is that gate in
Christ by which blessed are all they that have entered in and have
directed their way in holiness and righteousness, doing all things
without disorder. Let a man be faithful: let him be powerful in the
utterance of knowledge; let him be wise in judging of words; let him be
pure in all his deeds; yet the more he seems to be superior to others
\[in these respects\], the more humble-minded ought he to be, and to
seek the common good of all, and not merely his own advantage.
