### <span id="viii.iv.xxiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXIV.—The Christians’ circumcision far more excellent.

<span id="viii.iv.xxiv-p1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.xxiv-p1.1"></span>“Now, sirs,” I said, “it is possible for
us to show how the eighth day possessed a certain mysterious import,
which the seventh day did not possess, and which was promulgated by God
through these rites. But lest I appear now to diverge to other subjects,
understand what I say: the blood of that circumcision is obsolete, and
we trust in the blood of salvation; there is now another covenant, and
another law has gone forth from Zion. Jesus Christ circumcises all who
will—as was declared above —with knives of stone; <span
id="fr_2005"></span>[2006](#fn_2005.md) that they may be a righteous
nation, a people keeping faith, holding to the truth, and maintaining
peace. Come then with me, all who fear God, who wish to see the good of
Jerusalem. Come, let us go to the light of the Lord; for He has
liberated His people, the house of Jacob. Come, all nations; let us
gather ourselves together at Jerusalem, no longer plagued by war for the
sins of her people. ‘For I was manifest to them that sought Me not; I
was found of them that asked not for Me;’ <span
id="fr_2006"></span>[2007](#fn_2006.md) He exclaims by Isaiah: ‘I said,
Behold Me, unto nations which were not called by My name. I have spread
out My hands all the day unto a disobedient and gainsaying people, which
walked in a way that was not good, but after their own sins. It is a
people that provoketh Me to my face.’ <span
