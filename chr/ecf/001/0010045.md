### <span id="ii.ii.xl-p0.1"></span>Chapter XL.—Let us preserve in the Church the order appointed by God.

<span id="ii.ii.xl-p1"></span><span id="ii.ii.xl-p1.1"></span><span
id="ii.ii.xl-p1.2"></span><span id="ii.ii.xl-p1.3"></span>These things
therefore being manifest to us, and since we look into the depths of the
divine knowledge, it behoves us to do all things in \[their proper\]
order, which the Lord has commanded us to perform at stated times. <span
id="fr_174"></span>[175](#fn_174.md) <span id="ii.ii.xl-p2.3"></span><span
id="ii.ii.xl-p2.4"></span>He has enjoined offerings \[to be presented\]
and service to be performed \[to Him\], and that not thoughtlessly or
irregularly, but at the appointed times and hours. <span
id="ii.ii.xl-p2.5"></span>Where and by whom He desires these things to
be done, He Himself has fixed by His own supreme will, in order that all
things being piously done according to His good pleasure, may be
acceptable unto Him. <span id="fr_175"></span>[176](#fn_175.md) Those,
therefore, who present their offerings at the appointed times, are
accepted and blessed; for inasmuch as they follow the laws of the Lord,
they sin not. For his own peculiar services are assigned to the high
priest, and their own proper place is prescribed to the priests, and
their own special ministrations devolve on the Levites. The layman is
bound by the laws that pertain to laymen.
