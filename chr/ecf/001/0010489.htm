<p> <a name="viii.iv.xxviii"></A>  <h3 align="center" align="center"><a name="viii.iv.xxviii-p0.1"></A>Chapter XXVIII.&#8212;True righteousness is obtained by Christ.</h3>  
<p><a name="viii.iv.xxviii-p1"></A>And Trypho replied, &#8220;We heard you adducing this consideration a little ago, and we have given it attention: for, to tell the truth, it is worthy of attention; and that answer which pleases most &#8212;namely, that so it seemed good to Him&#8212;does not satisfy me. For this is ever the shift to which those have recourse who are unable to answer the question.&#8221;</p>  
<p><a name="viii.iv.xxviii-p2"></A><a name="viii.iv.xxviii-p2.1"></A><a name="viii.iv.xxviii-p2.2"></A><a name="viii.iv.xxviii-p2.3"></A>Then I said, &#8220;Since I bring from the Scriptures and the facts themselves both the proofs and the inculcation of them, do not delay or hesitate to put faith in me, although I am an uncircumcised man; so short a time is left you in which to become proselytes. If Christ&#146;s coming shall have anticipated you, in vain you will repent, in vain you will weep; for He will not hear you. &#145;Break up your fallow ground,&#146; Jeremiah has cried to the people, &#145;and sow not among thorns. Circumcise yourselves to the Lord, and circumcise the foreskin of your heart.&#146;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2018"></A><A HREF="#fn_2018"><FONT SIZE="1">2019</FONT></A>
 Do not sow, therefore, among thorns, and in untilled ground, whence you can have no fruit. Know Christ; and behold the fallow ground, good, good and fat, is in your hearts. &#145;For, behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will visit all them that are circumcised in their foreskins; Egypt, and Judah,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2019"></A><A HREF="#fn_2019"><FONT SIZE="1">2020</FONT></A>
 and Edom, and the sons of Moab. For all the nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in their hearts.&#146;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2020"></A><A HREF="#fn_2020"><FONT SIZE="1">2021</FONT></A>
 Do you see how that God does not mean this circumcision which is given for a sign? For it is of no use to the Egyptians, or the sons of Moab, or the sons of Edom. But though a man be a Scythian or a Persian, if he has the knowledge of God and of His Christ, and keeps the everlasting righteous decrees, he is circumcised with the good and useful circumcision, and is a friend of God, and God rejoices in his gifts and offerings. But I will lay before you, my friends, the very words of God, when He said to the people by Malachi, one of the twelve prophets, &#145;I have no pleasure in you, saith the Lord; and I shall not accept your sacrifices at your hands: for from the rising of the sun unto its setting My name shall be glorified among the Gentiles; and in every place a sacrifice is offered unto My name, even a pure sacrifice: for My name is honoured among the Gentiles, saith the Lord; but ye profane it.&#146;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2021"></A><A HREF="#fn_2021"><FONT SIZE="1">2022</FONT></A>
 And by David He said, &#145;A people whom I have not known, served Me; at the hearing of the ear they obeyed Me.&#146;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2022"></A><A HREF="#fn_2022"><FONT SIZE="1">2023</FONT></A>
