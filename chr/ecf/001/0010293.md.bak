### <span id="v.xvii.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.—Apostrophe to Satan.

<span id="v.xvii.v-p1"></span><span id="v.xvii.v-p1.1"></span>For if the
Lord were a mere man, possessed of a soul and body only, why dost thou
mutilate and explain away His being born with the common nature of
humanity? Why dost thou call the passion a mere appearance, as if it
were any strange thing happening to a \[mere\] man? And why dost thou
reckon the death of a mortal to be simply an imaginary death? But if,
\[on the other hand,\] He is both God and man, then why dost thou call
it unlawful to style Him “the Lord of glory,” <span
id="fr_1325"></span>[1326](#fn_1325.md) who is by nature unchangeable? Why
dost thou say that it is unlawful to declare of the Lawgiver who
possesses a human soul, “The Word was made flesh,” <span
id="fr_1326"></span>[1327](#fn_1326.md) and was a perfect man, and not
merely one dwelling in a man? But how came this magician into existence,
who of old formed all nature that can be apprehended either by the
senses or intellect, according to the will of the Father; and, when He
became incarnate, healed every kind of disease and infirmity? <span
