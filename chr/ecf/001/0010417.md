### <span id="viii.ii.xliv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XLIV.—Not nullified by prophecy.

<span id="viii.ii.xliv-p1"></span><span
id="viii.ii.xliv-p1.1"></span><span id="viii.ii.xliv-p1.2"></span>And
the holy Spirit of prophecy taught us this, telling us by Moses that God
spoke thus to the man first created: “Behold, before thy face are good
and evil: choose the good.” <span id="fr_1855"></span>[1856](#fn_1855.md)
And again, by the other prophet Isaiah, that the following utterance was
made as if from God the Father and Lord of all: “Wash you, make you
clean; put away evils from your souls; learn to do well; judge the
orphan, and plead for the widow: and come and let us reason together,
saith the Lord: And if your sins be as scarlet, I will make them white
as wool; and if they be red like as crimson, I will make them white as
snow. And if ye be willing and obey Me, ye shall eat the good of the
land; but if ye do not obey Me, the sword shall devour you: for the
mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.” <span
id="fr_1856"></span>[1857](#fn_1856.md) And that expression, “The sword
shall devour you,” does not mean that the disobedient shall be slain by
the sword, but the sword of God is fire, of which they who choose to do
wickedly become the fuel. Wherefore He says, “The sword shall devour
you: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.” And if He had spoken
concerning a sword that cuts and at once despatches, He would not have
said, shall *devour*. <span id="viii.ii.xliv-p3.2"></span>And so, too,
Plato, when he says, “The blame is his who chooses, and God is
blameless,” <span id="fr_1857"></span>[1858](#fn_1857.md) took this from
the prophet Moses and uttered it. For Moses is more ancient than all the
Greek writers. <span id="viii.ii.xliv-p4.1"></span>And whatever both
philosophers and poets have said concerning the immortality of the soul,
or punishments after death, or contemplation of things heavenly, or
doctrines of the like kind, they have received such suggestions from the
prophets as have enabled them to understand and interpret these things.
And hence there seem to be seeds of truth among all men; but they are
charged with not accurately understanding \[the truth\] when they assert
contradictories. <span id="viii.ii.xliv-p4.2"></span>So that what we say
about future events being foretold, we do not say it as if they came
about by a fatal necessity; but God foreknowing all that shall be done
by all men, and it being His decree that the future actions of men shall
all be recompensed according to their several value, He foretells by the
Spirit of prophecy that He will bestow meet rewards according to the
merit of the actions done, always urging the human <span
id="page_178">p. 178</span> <span id="viii.ii.xliv-Page_178"></span>
race to effort and recollection, showing that He cares and provides for
men. But by the agency of the devils death has been decreed against
those who read the books of Hystaspes, or of the Sibyl, <span
id="fr_1858"></span>[1859](#fn_1858.md) or of the prophets, that through
fear they may prevent men who read them from receiving the knowledge of
the good, and may retain them in slavery to themselves; which, however,
they could not always effect. For not only do we fearlessly read them,
but, as you see, bring them for your inspection, knowing that their
contents will be pleasing to all. And if we persuade even a few, our
gain will be very great; for, as good husbandmen, we shall receive the
reward from the Master.
