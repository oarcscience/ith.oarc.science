### <span id="ix.vi.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.—The author returns to his former argument, and shows that there was but one God announced by the law and prophets, whom Christ confesses as His Father, and who, through His word, one living God with Him, made Himself known to men in both covenants.

<span id="ix.vi.vi-p1"></span>1. <span id="ix.vi.vi-p1.1"></span>God,
therefore, is one and the same, who rolls up the heaven as a book, and
renews the face of the earth; who made the things of time for man, so
that coming to maturity in them, he may produce the fruit of
immortality; and who, through His kindness, also bestows \[upon him\]
eternal things, “that in the ages to come He may show the exceeding
riches of His grace;” <span id="fr_3842"></span>[3843](#fn_3842.md) who was
announced by the law and the prophets, whom Christ confessed as His
Father. Now He is the Creator, and He it is who is God over all, as
Esaias says, “I am witness, saith the <span class="upper"><span
id="ix.vi.vi-p2.2"></span>Lord</span> God, and my servant whom I have
chosen, that ye may know, and believe, and understand that I <span
class="upper"><span id="ix.vi.vi-p2.3"></span>am</span>. Before me there
was no other God, neither shall be after me. I am God, and besides me
there is no Saviour. I have proclaimed, and I have saved.” <span
id="fr_3843"></span>[3844](#fn_3843.md) And again: “I myself am the first
God, and I am above things to come.” <span
id="fr_3844"></span>[3845](#fn_3844.md) For neither in an ambiguous, nor
arrogant, nor boastful manner, does He say these things; but since it
was impossible, without God, to come to a knowledge of God, He teaches
men, through His Word, to know God. To those, therefore, who are
ignorant of these matters, and on this account imagine that they have
discovered another Father, justly does one say, “Ye do err, not knowing
the Scriptures, nor the power of God.” <span
id="fr_3845"></span>[3846](#fn_3845.md)

<span id="ix.vi.vi-p6"></span>2. <span id="ix.vi.vi-p6.1"></span><span
id="ix.vi.vi-p6.2"></span><span id="ix.vi.vi-p6.3"></span>For our Lord
and Master, in the answer which He gave to the Sadducees, who say that
there is no resurrection, and who do therefore <span id="page_467">p.
467</span> <span id="ix.vi.vi-Page_467"></span> dishonour God, and lower
the credit of the law, did both indicate a resurrection, and reveal God,
saying to them, “Ye do err, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of
God.” “For, touching the resurrection of the dead,” He says, “have ye
not read that which was spoken by God, saying, I am the God of Abraham,
the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?” <span
id="fr_3846"></span>[3847](#fn_3846.md) And He added, “He is not the God of
the dead, but of the living; for all live to Him.” By these arguments He
unquestionably made it clear, that He who spake to Moses out of the
bush, and declared Himself to be the God of the fathers, He is the God
of the living. For who is the God of the living unless He who is God,
and above whom there is no other God? <span
id="ix.vi.vi-p7.3"></span>Whom also Daniel the prophet, when Cyrus king
of the Persians said to him, “Why dost thou not worship Bel?” <span
id="fr_3847"></span>[3848](#fn_3847.md) did proclaim, saying, “Because I do
not worship idols made with hands, but the living God, who established
the heaven and the earth and has dominion over all flesh.” Again did he
say, “I will adore the Lord my God, because He is the living God.” He,
then, who was adored by the prophets as the living God, He is the God of
the living; and His Word is He who also spake to Moses, who also put the
Sadducees to silence, who also bestowed the gift of resurrection, thus
revealing \[both\] truths to those who are blind, that is, the
resurrection and God \[in His true character\]. For if He be not the God
of the dead, but of the living, yet was called the God of the fathers
who were sleeping, they do indubitably live to God, and have not passed
out of existence, since they are children of the resurrection. But our
Lord is Himself the resurrection, as He does Himself declare, “I am the
resurrection and the life.” <span id="fr_3848"></span>[3849](#fn_3848.md)
But the fathers are His children; for it is said by the prophet:
“Instead of thy fathers, thy children have been made to thee.” <span
id="fr_3849"></span>[3850](#fn_3849.md) Christ Himself, therefore, together
with the Father, is the God of the living, who spake to Moses, and who
was also manifested to the fathers.

<span id="ix.vi.vi-p11"></span>3. And teaching this very thing, He said
to the Jews: “Your father Abraham rejoiced that he should see my day;
and he saw it, and was glad.” <span id="fr_3850"></span>[3851](#fn_3850.md)
What is intended? “Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for
righteousness.” <span id="fr_3851"></span>[3852](#fn_3851.md) In the first
place, \[he believed\] that He was the maker of heaven and earth, the
only God; and in the next place, that He would make his seed as the
stars of heaven. This is what is meant by Paul, \[when he says,\] “as
lights in the world.” <span id="fr_3852"></span>[3853](#fn_3852.md)
Righteously, therefore, having left his earthly kindred, he followed the
Word of God, walking as a pilgrim with the Word, that he might
\[afterwards\] have his abode with the Word.

<span id="ix.vi.vi-p15"></span>4. Righteously also the apostles, being
of the race of Abraham, left the ship and their father, and followed the
Word. Righteously also do we, possessing the same faith as Abraham, and
taking up the cross as Isaac did the wood, <span
id="fr_3853"></span>[3854](#fn_3853.md) follow Him. For in Abraham man had
learned beforehand, and had been accustomed to follow the Word of God.
For Abraham, according to his faith, followed the command of the Word of
God, and with a ready mind delivered up, as a sacrifice to God, his
only-begotten and beloved son, in order that God also might be pleased
to offer up for all his seed His own beloved and only-begotten Son, as a
sacrifice for our redemption.

<span id="ix.vi.vi-p17"></span>5. <span
id="ix.vi.vi-p17.1"></span>Since, therefore, Abraham was a prophet and
saw in the Spirit the day of the Lord’s coming, and the dispensation of
His suffering, through whom both he himself and all who, following the
example of his faith, trust in God, should be saved, he rejoiced
exceedingly. The Lord, therefore, was not unknown to Abraham, whose day
he desired to see; <span id="fr_3854"></span>[3855](#fn_3854.md) nor,
again, was the Lord’s Father, for he had learned from the Word of the
Lord, and believed Him; wherefore it was accounted to him by the Lord
for righteousness. For faith towards God justifies a man; and therefore
he said, “I will stretch forth my hand to the most high God, who made
the heaven and the earth.” <span id="fr_3855"></span>[3856](#fn_3855.md)
All these truths, however, do those holding perverse opinions endeavour
to overthrow, because of one passage, which they certainly do not
understand correctly.
