### <span id="v.iii.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.—Some wickedly act independently of the bishop.

<span id="v.iii.iv-p1"></span><span id="v.iii.iv-p1.1"></span>It is
fitting, then, not only to be called Christians, but to be so in
reality: as some indeed give one the title of bishop, but do all things
without him. Now such persons seem to me to be not possessed of a good
conscience, seeing they are not stedfastly gathered together according
to the commandment.

<span id="v.iii.iv-p2"></span><span id="v.iii.iv-p2.1"></span>It is
fitting, then, not only to be called Christians, but to be so in
reality. For it is not the being called so, but the being really so,
that renders a man blessed. To those who indeed talk of the bishop, but
do all things without him, will He who is the true and first Bishop, and
the only High Priest by nature, declare, “Why call ye Me Lord, and do
not the things which I say?” <span id="fr_662"></span>[663](#fn_662.md) For
such persons seem to me not possessed of a good conscience, but to be
simply dissemblers and hypocrites.
