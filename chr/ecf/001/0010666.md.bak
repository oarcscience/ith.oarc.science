### <span id="viii.viii.x-p0.1"></span>Chapter X.—The body saved, and will therefore rise.

<span id="viii.viii.x-p1"></span>The resurrection is a resurrection of
the flesh which died. For the spirit dies not; the soul is in the body,
and without a soul it cannot live. The body, when the soul forsakes it,
is not. For the body is the house of the soul; and the soul the house of
the spirit. These three, in all those who cherish a sincere hope and
unquestioning faith in God, will be saved. Considering, therefore, even
such arguments as are suited to this world, and finding that, even
according to them, it is not impossible that the flesh be regenerated;
and seeing that, besides all these proofs, the Saviour in the whole
Gospel shows that there is salvation for the flesh, why do we any longer
endure those unbelieving and dangerous arguments, and fail to see that
we are retrograding when we listen to such an argument as this: that the
soul is immortal, but the body mortal, and incapable of being revived?
For this we used to hear from Pythagoras and Plato, <span
id="page_299">p. 299</span> <span id="viii.viii.x-Page_299"></span> even
before we learned the truth. If then the Saviour said this, and
proclaimed salvation to the soul alone, what new thing, beyond what we
heard from Pythagoras and Plato and all their band, did He bring us? But
now He has come proclaiming the glad tidings of a new and strange hope
to men. For indeed it was a strange and new thing for God to promise
that He would not keep incorruption in incorruption, but would make
corruption incorruption. But because the prince of wickedness could in
no other way corrupt the truth, he sent forth his apostles (evil men who
introduced pestilent doctrines), choosing them from among those who
crucified our Saviour; and these men bore the name of the Saviour, but
did the works of him that sent them, through whom the name itself has
been spoken against. But if the flesh do not rise, why is it also
guarded, and why do we not rather suffer it to indulge its desires? Why
do we not imitate physicians, who, it is said, when they get a patient
that is despaired of and incurable, allow him to indulge his desires?
For they know that he is dying; and this indeed those who hate the flesh
surely do, casting it out of its inheritance, so far as they can; for on
this account they also despise it, because it is shortly to become a
corpse. But if our physician Christ, God, having rescued us from our
desires, regulates our flesh with His own wise and temperate rule, it is
evident that He guards it from sins because it possesses a hope of
salvation, as physicians do not suffer men whom they hope to save to
indulge in what pleasures they please. <span
