### <span id="viii.iv.xlvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XLVII.—Justin communicates with Christians who observe the law. Not a few Catholics do otherwise.

<span id="viii.iv.xlvii-p1"></span>And Trypho again inquired, “But if
some one, knowing that this is so, after he recognises that this man is
Christ, and has believed in and obeys Him, wishes, however, to observe
these \[institutions\], will he be saved?”

<span id="viii.iv.xlvii-p2"></span>I said, “In my opinion, Trypho, such
an one will be saved, if he does not strive in every way to persuade
other men, —I mean those Gentiles who have been circumcised from error
by Christ, to observe the same things as himself, telling them that they
will not be saved unless they do so. This you did yourself at the
commencement of the discourse, when you declared that I would not be
saved unless I observe these institutions.”

<span id="viii.iv.xlvii-p3"></span>Then he replied, “Why then have you
said, ‘In my opinion, such an one will be saved,’ unless there are
some <span id="fr_2090"></span>[2091](#fn_2090.md) who affirm that such
will not be saved?”

<span id="viii.iv.xlvii-p5"></span>“There are such people, Trypho,” I
answered; “and these do not venture to have any intercourse with or to
extend hospitality to such persons; but I do not agree with them. But if
some, through weak-mindedness, wish to observe such institutions as were
given by Moses, from which they expect some virtue, but which we believe
were appointed by reason of the hardness of the people’s hearts, along
with their hope in this Christ, and \[wish to perform\] the eternal and
natural acts of righteousness and piety, yet choose to live with the
Christians and the faithful, as I said before, not inducing them either
to be circumcised like themselves, or to keep the Sabbath, or to observe
any other such ceremonies, then I hold that we ought to join ourselves
to such, and associate with them in all things as kinsmen and brethren.
But if, Trypho,” I continued, “some of your race, who say they believe
in this Christ, compel those Gentiles who believe in this Christ to live
in all respects according to the law given by Moses, or choose not to
associate so intimately with them, I in like manner do not approve of
them. But I believe that even those, who have been persuaded by them to
observe the legal dispensation along with their confession of God in
Christ, shall probably be saved. And I hold, further, that such as have
confessed and known this man to be Christ, yet who have gone back from
some cause to the legal dispensation, and have denied that this man is
Christ, and have repented not before death, shall by no means be saved.
Further, I hold that those of the seed of Abraham who live according to
the law, and do not believe in this Christ before death, shall likewise
not be saved, and especially those who have anathematized and do
anathematize this very Christ in the synagogues, and everything by which
they might obtain salvation and escape the vengeance of fire. <span

loving-kindness <span id="page_219">p. 219</span> <span
id="viii.iv.xlvii-Page_219"></span> of God, and His boundless riches,
hold righteous and sinless the man who, as Ezekiel <span
id="fr_2092"></span>[2093](#fn_2092.md) tells, repents of sins; and reckons
sinful, unrighteous, and impious the man who fails away from piety and
righteousness to unrighteousness and ungodliness. Wherefore also our
Lord Jesus Christ said, ‘In whatsoever things I shall take you, in these
I shall judge you.’ ” <span id="fr_2093"></span>[2094](#fn_2093.md)

reads: “Do anathematize those who put their trust in this very Christ so
as to obtain salvation,” etc.
