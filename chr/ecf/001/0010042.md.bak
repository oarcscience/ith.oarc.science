### <span id="ii.ii.xxxvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXVII.—Christ is our leader, and we His soldiers.

<span id="ii.ii.xxxvii-p1"></span><span
id="ii.ii.xxxvii-p1.1"></span><span id="ii.ii.xxxvii-p1.2"></span>Let us
then, men and brethren, with all energy act the part of soldiers, in
accordance with His holy commandments. Let us consider those who serve
under our generals, with what order, obedience, and submissiveness they
perform the things which are commanded them. All are not prefects, nor
commanders of a thousand, nor of a hundred, nor of fifty, nor the like,
but each one in his own rank performs the things commanded by the king
and the generals. The great cannot subsist without the small, nor the
small without the great. There is a kind of mixture in all things, and
thence arises mutual advantage. <span id="fr_161"></span>[162](#fn_161.md)
Let us take our body for an example. <span
id="fr_162"></span>[163](#fn_162.md) The head is nothing without the feet,
and the feet are nothing without the head; yea, the very smallest
members of our body are necessary and useful to the whole body. But all
work <span id="fr_163"></span>[164](#fn_163.md) harmoniously together, and
are under one common rule <span id="fr_164"></span>[165](#fn_164.md) for
the preservation of the whole body.
