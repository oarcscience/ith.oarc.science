### <span id="viii.ii.ix-p0.1"></span>Chapter IX.—Folly of idol worship.

<span id="viii.ii.ix-p1"></span><span id="viii.ii.ix-p1.1"></span><span
id="viii.ii.ix-p1.2"></span>And neither do we honour with many
sacrifices and garlands of flowers such deities as men have formed and
set in shrines and called gods; since we see that these are soulless and
dead, and have not the form of God (for we do not consider that God has
such a form as some say that they imitate to His honour), but have the
names and forms of those wicked demons which have appeared. For why need
we tell you who already know, into what forms the craftsmen, <span
id="fr_1780"></span>[1781](#fn_1780) carving and cutting, casting and
hammering, fashion the materials? And often out of vessels of dishonour,
by merely changing the form, and making an image of the requisite shape,
they make what they call a god; which we consider not only senseless,
but to be even insulting to God, who, having ineffable glory and form,
thus gets His name attached to things that are corruptible, and require
constant service. And that the artificers of these are both intemperate,
and, not to enter into particulars, are practised in every vice, you
very well know; even their own girls who work along with them they
corrupt. What infatuation! that dissolute men should be said to fashion
and make gods for your worship, and that you should appoint such men the
guardians of the temples where they are enshrined; not recognising that
it is unlawful even to think or say that men are the guardians of gods.
