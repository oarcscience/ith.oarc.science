### <span id="vi.ii.xii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XII.—The cross of Christ frequently announced in the Old Testament.

<span id="vi.ii.xii-p1"></span><span id="vi.ii.xii-p1.1"></span>In like
manner He points to the cross of Christ in another prophet, who
saith, <span id="fr_1604"></span>[1605](#fn_1604.md) “And when shall these
things be accomplished? And the Lord saith, When a tree shall be bent
down, and again arise, and when blood shall flow out of wood.” <span
id="fr_1605"></span>[1606](#fn_1605.md) Here again you have an intimation
concerning the cross, and Him who should be crucified. <span
id="vi.ii.xii-p3.2"></span>Yet again He speaks of this <span
id="fr_1606"></span>[1607](#fn_1606.md) in Moses, when Israel was attacked
by strangers. <span id="vi.ii.xii-p4.1"></span>And that He might remind
them, when assailed, that it was on account of their sins they were
delivered to death, the Spirit speaks to the heart of Moses, that he
should make a figure of the cross, <span
id="fr_1607"></span>[1608](#fn_1607.md) and of Him about to suffer thereon;
for unless they put their trust in Him, they shall be overcome for ever.
Moses therefore placed one weapon above another in the midst of the
hill, <span id="fr_1608"></span>[1609](#fn_1608.md) and <span
id="page_145">p. 145</span> <span id="vi.ii.xii-Page_145"></span>
standing upon it, so as to be higher than all the people, he stretched
forth his hands, <span id="fr_1609"></span>[1610](#fn_1609.md) and thus
again Israel acquired the mastery. But when again he let down his hands,
they were again destroyed. For what reason? That they might know that
they could not be saved unless they put their trust in Him. <span
id="fr_1610"></span>[1611](#fn_1610.md) And in another prophet He declares,
“All day long I have stretched forth My hands to an unbelieving people,
and one that gainsays My righteous way.” <span
id="fr_1611"></span>[1612](#fn_1611.md) And again Moses makes a type of
Jesus, \[signifying\] that it was necessary for Him to suffer, \[and
also\] that He would be the author of life <span
id="fr_1612"></span>[1613](#fn_1612.md) \[to others\], whom they believed
to have destroyed on the cross <span
id="fr_1613"></span>[1614](#fn_1613.md) when Israel was failing. For since
transgression was committed by Eve through means of the serpent, \[the
Lord\] brought it to pass that every \[kind of\] serpents bit them, and
they died, <span id="fr_1614"></span>[1615](#fn_1614.md) that He might
convince them, that on account of their transgression they were given
over to the straits of death. Moreover Moses, when he commanded, “Ye
shall not have any graven or molten \[image\] for your God,” <span
id="fr_1615"></span>[1616](#fn_1615.md) did so that he might reveal a type
of Jesus. <span id="vi.ii.xii-p13.2"></span>Moses then makes a brazen
serpent, and places it upon a beam, <span
id="fr_1616"></span>[1617](#fn_1616.md) and by proclamation assembles the
people. When, therefore, they were come together, they besought Moses
that he would offer sacrifice <span id="fr_1617"></span>[1618](#fn_1617.md)
in their behalf, and pray for their recovery. And Moses spake unto them,
saying, “When any one of you is bitten, let him come to the serpent
placed on the pole; and let him hope and believe, that even though dead,
it is able to give him life, and immediately he shall be
restored.” <span id="fr_1618"></span>[1619](#fn_1618.md) And they did so.
Thou hast in this also \[an indication of\] the glory of Jesus; for in
Him and to Him are all things. <span
id="fr_1619"></span>[1620](#fn_1619.md) What, again, says Moses to Jesus
(Joshua) the son of Nave, when he gave him <span
id="fr_1620"></span>[1621](#fn_1620.md) this name, as being a prophet, with
this view only, that all the people might hear that the Father would
reveal all things concerning His Son Jesus to the son <span
id="fr_1621"></span>[1622](#fn_1621.md) of Nave? This name then being given
him when he sent him to spy out the land, he said, “Take a book into thy
hands, and write what the Lord declares, that the Son of God will in the
last days cut off from the roots all the house of Amalek.” <span
id="fr_1622"></span>[1623](#fn_1622.md) <span
id="vi.ii.xii-p20.2"></span>Behold again: Jesus who was manifested, both
by type and in the flesh, <span id="fr_1623"></span>[1624](#fn_1623.md) is
not the Son of man, but the Son of God. Since, therefore, they were to
say that Christ was the son <span id="fr_1624"></span>[1625](#fn_1624.md)
of David, fearing and understanding the error of the wicked, he saith,
“The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit at My right hand, until I make Thine
enemies Thy footstool.” <span id="fr_1625"></span>[1626](#fn_1625.md) And
again, thus saith Isaiah, “The Lord said to Christ, <span
id="fr_1626"></span>[1627](#fn_1626.md) my Lord, whose right hand I have
holden, <span id="fr_1627"></span>[1628](#fn_1627.md) that the nations
should yield obedience before Him; and I will break in pieces the
strength of kings.” <span id="fr_1628"></span>[1629](#fn_1628.md) Behold
how David calleth Him Lord and the Son of God.

<span id="vi.ii.xii-p2"></span> Cod. Sin. refers this to *God*, and not
to the prophet.

<span id="vi.ii.xii-p6"></span> Cod. Sin. reads <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.ii.xii-p6.1"></span>πυγμῆς</span>, which must
here be translated “heap” or “mass.” According to Hilgenfeld, however,
<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.ii.xii-p6.2"></span>πυγμή</span> is
here equivalent to <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ii.xii-p6.3"></span>πυγμαχία</span>, “a fight.” The meaning would
then be, that “Moses piled weapon upon weapon in the midst of the
*battle*,” instead of “hill” (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ii.xii-p6.4"></span>πήγης</span>), as above.
