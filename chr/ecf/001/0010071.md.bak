<span id="iii.ii.iv"></span>

### <span id="iii.ii.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.—The other observances of the Jews.

<span id="iii.ii.iv-p1"></span>But as to their scrupulosity concerning
meats, and their superstition as respects the Sabbaths, and their
boasting about circumcision, and their fancies about fasting and the new
moons, which are utterly ridiculous and unworthy of notice,—I do
not <span id="fr_274"></span>[275](#fn_274.md) think that you require to
learn anything from me. For, to accept some of those things which have
been formed by God for the use of men as properly formed, and to reject
others as useless and redundant,—how can this be lawful? And to speak
falsely of God, as if He forbade us to do what is good on the
Sabbath-days,—how is not this impious? And to glory in the
circumcision <span id="fr_275"></span>[276](#fn_275.md) of the flesh as a
proof of election, and as if, on account of it, they were specially
beloved by God,—how is it not a subject of ridicule? And as to their
observing months and days, <span id="fr_276"></span>[277](#fn_276.md) as if
waiting upon <span id="fr_277"></span>[278](#fn_277.md) the stars and the
moon, and their distributing, <span id="fr_278"></span>[279](#fn_278.md)
according to their own tendencies, the appointments of God, and the
vicissitudes of the seasons, some for festivities, <span
id="fr_279"></span>[280](#fn_279.md) and others for mourning,—who would
deem this a part of divine worship, and not much rather a manifestation
of folly? I suppose, then, you are sufficiently convinced that the
Christians properly abstain from the vanity and error common \[to both
Jews and Gentiles\], and from the busy-body spirit and vain boasting of
the Jews; but you must not hope to learn the mystery of their peculiar
mode of worshipping God from any mortal.

<span id="iii.ii.iv-p2"></span> Otto, resting on <span
class="upper"><span id="iii.ii.iv-p2.1"></span>ms.</span> authority,
omits the negative, but the sense seems to require its insertion.

<span id="fn_275"></span>[26:276](0010071.htm#fr_275.md) <span
id="iii.ii.iv-p2.2"></span>

<span id="iii.ii.iv-p3"></span> Literally, “lessening.”

id="iii.ii.iv-p4.2"></span>

<span id="iii.ii.iv-p5"></span> This seems to refer to the practice of
Jews in fixing the beginning of the day, and consequently of the
Sabbath, from the rising of the stars. They used to say, that when three
stars of moderate magnitude appeared, it was night; when two, it was
twilight; and when only one, that day had not yet departed. It thus came
to pass (according to their *night-day* (<span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.ii.iv-p5.1"></span>νυχθήμερον</span>) reckoning), that whosoever
engaged in work on the evening of Friday, the beginning of the Sabbath,
after three stars of moderate size were visible, was held to have
sinned, and had to present a trespass-offering; and so on, according to
the fanciful rule described.

<span id="iii.ii.iv-p6"></span> Otto supplies the *lacuna* which here
occurs in the <span class="upper"><span
id="iii.ii.iv-p6.1"></span>mss.</span> so as to read <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.ii.iv-p6.2"></span>καταδιαιρεῖν</span>.

<span id="fn_279"></span>[26:280](0010071.htm#fr_279.md) <span
id="iii.ii.iv-p6.3"></span>

<span id="iii.ii.iv-p7"></span> The great festivals of the Jews are here
referred to on the one hand, and the day of atonement on the other.
