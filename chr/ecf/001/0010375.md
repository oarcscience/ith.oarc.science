### <span id="viii.ii.ii-p0.1"></span>Chapter II.—Justice demanded.

<span id="viii.ii.ii-p1"></span><span id="viii.ii.ii-p1.1"></span><span
id="viii.ii.ii-p1.2"></span><span id="viii.ii.ii-p1.3"></span>Reason
directs those who are truly pious and philosophical to honour and love
only what is true, declining to follow traditional opinions, <span
id="fr_1767"></span>[1768](#fn_1767) if these be worthless. For not only
does sound reason direct us to refuse the guidance of those who did or
taught anything wrong, but it is incumbent on the lover of truth, by all
means, and if death be threatened, even before his own life, to choose
to do and say what is right. Do you, then, since ye are called pious and
philosophers, guardians of justice and lovers of learning, give good
heed, and hearken to my address; and if ye are indeed such, it will be
manifested. For we have come, not to flatter you by this writing, nor
please you by our address, but to beg that you pass judgment, after an
accurate and searching investigation, not flattered by prejudice or by a
desire of pleasing superstitious men, nor induced by irrational impulse
or evil rumours which have long been prevalent, to give a decision which
will prove to be against yourselves. For as for us, we reckon that no
evil can be done us, unless we be convicted as evil-doers or be proved
to be wicked men; and you, you can kill, but not hurt us.
