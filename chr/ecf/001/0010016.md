### <span id="ii.ii.xi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XI.—Continuation. Lot.

<span id="ii.ii.xi-p1"></span><span id="ii.ii.xi-p1.1"></span>On account
of his hospitality and godliness, Lot was saved out of Sodom when all
the country round was punished by means of fire and brimstone, the Lord
thus making it manifest that He does not forsake those that hope in Him,
but gives up such as depart from Him to punishment and torture. <span
id="fr_49"></span>[50](#fn_49) For Lot’s wife, who went forth with him,
being of a different mind from himself and not continuing in agreement
with him \[as to the command which had been given them\], was made an
example of, so as to be a pillar of salt unto this day. <span
id="fr_50"></span>[51](#fn_50) This was done that all might know that
those who are of a double mind, and who distrust the power of God, bring
down judgment on themselves <span id="fr_51"></span>[52](#fn_51) and
become a sign to all succeeding generations.
