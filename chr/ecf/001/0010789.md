<span id="ix.iv.xxiii"></span>

### <span id="ix.iv.xxiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXII.—Christ assumed actual flesh, conceived and born of the Virgin.

<span id="ix.iv.xxiii-p1"></span>1. <span
id="ix.iv.xxiii-p1.1"></span><span id="ix.iv.xxiii-p1.2"></span><span
id="ix.iv.xxiii-p1.3"></span>Those, therefore, who allege that He took
nothing from the Virgin do greatly err, \[since,\] in order that they
may cast away the inheritance of the flesh, they also reject the analogy
\[between Him and Adam\]. For if the one \[who sprang\] from the earth
had indeed formation and substance from both the hand and workmanship of
God, but the other not from the hand and workmanship of God, then He who
was made after the image and likeness of the former did not, in that
case, preserve the analogy of man, and He must seem an inconsistent
piece of work, not having wherewith He may show His wisdom. But this is
to say, that He also appeared putatively as man when He was not man, and
that He was made man while taking nothing from man. For if He did not
receive the substance of flesh from a human being, He neither was made
man nor the Son of man; and if He was not made what we were, He did no
great thing in what He suffered and endured. But every one will allow
that we are \[composed of\] a body taken from the earth, and a soul
receiving spirit from God. This, therefore, the Word of God was made,
recapitulating in Himself His own handiwork; and on this account does He
confess Himself the Son of man, and blesses “the meek, because they
shall inherit the earth.” <span id="fr_3738"></span>[3739](#fn_3738) The
Apostle Paul, moreover, in the Epistle to the Galatians, declares
plainly, “God sent His Son, made of a woman.” <span
id="fr_3739"></span>[3740](#fn_3739) And again, in that to the Romans,
he says, “Concerning His Son, who was made of the seed of David
according to the flesh, who was predestinated as the Son of God with
power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the
dead, Jesus Christ our Lord.” <span id="fr_3740"></span>[3741](#fn_3740)

<span id="ix.iv.xxiii-p5"></span>2. <span
id="fr_3741"></span>[3742](#fn_3741) Superfluous, too, in that case is
His descent into Mary; for why did He come down into her if He were to
take nothing of her? Still further, if He had taken nothing of Mary, He
would never have availed Himself of those kinds of food which are
derived from the earth, by which that body which has been taken from the
earth is nourished; nor would He have hungered, fasting those forty
days, like Moses and Elias, unless His body was craving after its own
proper nourishment; nor, again, would John His disciple have said, when
writing of Him, “But Jesus, being wearied with the journey, was sitting
\[to rest\];” <span id="fr_3742"></span>[3743](#fn_3742) nor would David
have proclaimed of Him beforehand, “They have added to the grief of my
wounds;” <span id="fr_3743"></span>[3744](#fn_3743) nor would He have
wept over Lazarus, nor have sweated great drops of blood; nor have
declared, “My soul is exceeding sorrowful;” <span
id="fr_3744"></span>[3745](#fn_3744) nor, when His side was pierced,
would there <span id="page_455">p. 455</span> <span
id="ix.iv.xxiii-Page_455"></span> have come forth blood and water. For
all these are tokens of the flesh which had been derived from the earth,
which He had recapitulated in Himself, bearing salvation to His own
handiwork.

<span id="ix.iv.xxiii-p10"></span>3. Wherefore Luke points out that the
pedigree which traces the generation of our Lord back to Adam contains
seventy-two generations, connecting the end with the beginning, and
implying that it is He who has summed up in Himself all nations
dispersed from Adam downwards, and all languages and generations of men,
together with Adam himself. Hence also was Adam himself termed by Paul
“the figure of Him that was to come,” <span
id="fr_3745"></span>[3746](#fn_3745) because the Word, the Maker of all
things, had formed beforehand for Himself the future dispensation of the
human race, connected with the Son of God; God having predestined that
the first man should be of an animal nature, with this view, that he
might be saved by the spiritual One. For inasmuch as He had a
pre-existence as a saving Being, it was necessary that what might be
saved should also be called into existence, in order that the Being who
saves should not exist in vain.

<span id="ix.iv.xxiii-p12"></span>4. <span
id="ix.iv.xxiii-p12.1"></span>In accordance with this design, Mary the
Virgin is found obedient, saying, “Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be
it unto me according to thy word.” <span
id="fr_3746"></span>[3747](#fn_3746) But Eve was disobedient; for she
did not obey when as yet she was a virgin. And even as she, having
indeed a husband, Adam, but being nevertheless as yet a virgin (for in
Paradise “they were both naked, and were not ashamed,” <span
id="fr_3747"></span>[3748](#fn_3747) inasmuch as they, having been
created a short time previously, had no understanding of the procreation
of children: for it was necessary that they should first come to adult
age, <span id="fr_3748"></span>[3749](#fn_3748) and then multiply from
that time onward), having become disobedient, was made the cause of
death, both to herself and to the entire human race; so also did Mary,
having a man betrothed \[to her\], and being nevertheless a virgin, by
yielding obedience, become the cause of salvation, both to herself and
the whole human race. And on this account does the law term a woman
betrothed to a man, the wife of him who had betrothed her, although she
was as yet a virgin; thus indicating the back-reference from Mary to
Eve, because what is joined together could not otherwise be put asunder
than by inversion of the process by which these bonds of union had
arisen; <span id="fr_3749"></span>[3750](#fn_3749) so that the former
ties be cancelled by the latter, that the latter may set the former
again at liberty. And it has, in fact, happened that the first compact
looses from the second tie, but that the second tie takes the position
of the first which has been cancelled. <span
id="fr_3750"></span>[3751](#fn_3750) For this reason did the Lord
declare that the first should in truth be last, and the last
first. <span id="fr_3751"></span>[3752](#fn_3751) And the prophet, too,
indicates the same, saying, “instead of fathers, children have been born
unto thee.” <span id="fr_3752"></span>[3753](#fn_3752) For the Lord,
having been born “the First-begotten of the dead,” <span
id="fr_3753"></span>[3754](#fn_3753) and receiving into His bosom the
ancient fathers, has regenerated them into the life of God, He having
been made Himself the beginning of those that live, as Adam became the
beginning of those who die. <span id="fr_3754"></span>[3755](#fn_3754)
Wherefore also Luke, commencing the genealogy with the Lord, carried it
back to Adam, indicating that it was He who regenerated them into the
Gospel of life, and not they Him. And thus also it was that the knot of
Eve’s disobedience was loosed by the obedience of Mary. For what the
virgin Eve had bound fast through unbelief, this did the virgin Mary set
free through faith.

us.

<span id="ix.iv.xxiii-p15"></span> This seems quite a peculiar opinion
of Irenæus, that our first parents, when created, were not of the age of
maturity.

<span id="ix.iv.xxiii-p17"></span> It is very difficult to follow the
reasoning of Irenæus in this passage. Massuet has a long note upon it,
in which he sets forth the various points of comparison and contrast
here indicated between Eve and Mary; but he ends with the remark, “hæc
certe et quæ sequuntur, paulo subtiliora.”
