<p><a name="viii.iii.viii-p1"></A><a name="viii.iii.viii-p1.1"></A>And those of the Stoic school&#8212;since, so far as their moral teaching went, they were admirable, as were also the poets in some particulars, on account of the seed of reason [the Logos] implanted in every race of men&#8212;were, we know, hated and put to death,&#8212;Heraclitus for instance, and, among those of our own time, Musonius and others. For, as we intimated, the devils have always effected, that all those who anyhow live a reasonable and earnest life, and shun vice, be hated. <a name="viii.iii.viii-p1.2"></A><a name="viii.iii.viii-p1.3"></A>And it is nothing wonderful; if the devils are proved to cause those to be much worse hated who live not according to a part only of the word diffused [among men] but by the knowledge and contemplation of the whole Word, which is Christ. And they, having been shut up in eternal fire, shall suffer their just punishment and penalty. For if they are even now overthrown by men through the name of Jesus Christ, this is an intimation of the punishment in eternal fire which is to be inflicted on themselves and those who serve them. For thus did both all the prophets foretell, and our own teacher Jesus teach.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1934"></A><A HREF="#fn_1934"><FONT SIZE="1">1935</FONT></A>
