### <span id="viii.iv.lix-p0.1"></span>Chapter LIX.—God distinct from the Father conversed with Moses.

<span id="viii.iv.lix-p1"></span><span id="viii.iv.lix-p1.1"></span>When
I had spoken these words, I continued: “Permit me, further, to show you
from the book of Exodus how this same One, who is both Angel, and God,
and Lord, and man, and who appeared in human form to Abraham and
Isaac, <span id="fr_2160"></span>[2161](#fn_2160.md) appeared in a flame of
fire from the bush, and conversed with Moses.” And after they said they
would listen cheerfully, patiently, and eagerly, I went on: “These words
are in the book which bears the title of Exodus: ‘And after many days
the king of Egypt died, and the children of Israel groaned by reason of
the works;’ <span id="fr_2161"></span>[2162](#fn_2161.md) and so on until,
‘Go and gather the elders of Israel, and thou shalt say unto them, The
Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the
God of Jacob, hath appeared to me, saying, I am surely beholding you,
and the things which have befallen you in Egypt.’ ” <span
id="fr_2162"></span>[2163](#fn_2162.md) In addition to these words, I went
on: “Have you perceived, sirs, that this very God whom Moses speaks of
as an Angel that talked to him in the flame of fire, declares to <span
id="page_227">p. 227</span> <span id="viii.iv.lix-Page_227"></span>
Moses that He is the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob?”
