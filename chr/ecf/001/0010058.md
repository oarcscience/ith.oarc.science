### <span id="ii.ii.liii-p0.1"></span>Chapter LIII.—The love of Moses towards his people.

<span id="ii.ii.liii-p1"></span><span id="ii.ii.liii-p1.1"></span><span
id="ii.ii.liii-p1.2"></span>Ye understand, beloved, ye understand well
the Sacred Scriptures, and ye have looked very earnestly into the
oracles of God. Call then these things to your remembrance. When Moses
went up into the mount, and abode there, with fasting and humiliation,
forty days and forty nights, the Lord said unto him, “Moses, Moses, get
thee down quickly from hence; for thy people whom thou didst bring out
of the land of Egypt have committed iniquity. They have speedily
departed from the way in which I commanded them to walk, and have made
to themselves molten images.” <span id="fr_235"></span>[236](#fn_235.md)
And the Lord said unto him, “I have spoken to thee once and again,
saying, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiff-necked
people: let Me destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven;
and I will make thee a great and wonderful nation, and one much more
numerous than this.” <span id="fr_236"></span>[237](#fn_236.md) But Moses
said, “Far be it from Thee, Lord: pardon the sin of this people; else
blot me also out of the book of the living.” <span
id="fr_237"></span>[238](#fn_237.md) O marvellous <span
id="fr_238"></span>[239](#fn_238.md) love! O insuperable perfection! The
servant speaks freely to his Lord, and asks forgiveness for the people,
or begs that he himself might perish <span
id="fr_239"></span>[240](#fn_239.md) along with them.
