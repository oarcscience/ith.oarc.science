<span id="ix.iv.xxiv"></span>

### <span id="ix.iv.xxiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXIII.—Arguments in opposition to Tatian, showing that it was consonant to divine justice and mercy that the first Adam should first partake in that salvation offered to all by Christ.

<span id="ix.iv.xxiv-p1"></span>1. <span id="ix.iv.xxiv-p1.1"></span>It
was necessary, therefore, that the Lord, coming to the lost sheep, and
making recapitulation of so comprehensive a dispensation, and seeking
after His own handiwork, should save that very man who had been created
after His image and likeness, that is, Adam, filling up the times of His
condemnation, which had been incurred through disobedience,—\[times\]
“which the Father had placed in His own power.” <span
id="fr_3755"></span>[3756](#fn_3755.md) \[This was necessary,\] too,
inasmuch as the whole economy of salvation regarding man came to pass
according to the good pleasure of the Father, in order that God might
not be conquered, nor His wisdom lessened, \[in the estimation of His
creatures.\] For if man, who had been created by God that he might live,
after losing life, through being injured by the serpent that had
corrupted him, should not any more return to life, but should be utterly
\[and for ever\] abandoned to death, God would \[in that case\] have
been conquered, and the wickedness of the serpent would have prevailed
over the will of God. But inasmuch as God is invincible and
long-suffering, He did indeed show Himself to be long-suffering in the
matter of the correction of man and the probation of all, as I have
already <span id="page_456">p. 456</span> <span
id="ix.iv.xxiv-Page_456"></span> observed; and by means of the second
man did He bind the strong man, and spoiled his goods, <span
id="fr_3756"></span>[3757](#fn_3756.md) and abolished death, vivifying that
man who had been in a state of death. For at the first Adam became a
vessel in his (Satan’s) possession, whom he did also hold under his
power, that is, by bringing sin on him iniquitously, and under colour of
immortality entailing death upon him. For, while promising that they
should be as gods, which was in no way possible for him to be, he
wrought death in them: wherefore he who had led man captive, was justly
captured in his turn by God; but man, who had been led captive, was
loosed from the bonds of condemnation.

<span id="ix.iv.xxiv-p4"></span>2. But this is Adam, if the truth should
be told, the first formed man, of whom the Scripture says that the Lord
spake, “Let Us make man after Our own image and likeness;” <span
id="fr_3757"></span>[3758](#fn_3757.md) and we are all from him: and as we
are from him, therefore have we all inherited his title. But inasmuch as
man is saved, it is fitting that he who was created the original man
should be saved. For it is too absurd to maintain, that he who was so
deeply injured by the enemy, and was the first to suffer captivity, was
not rescued by Him who conquered the enemy, but that his children were,
—those whom he had begotten in the same captivity. Neither would the
enemy appear to be as yet conquered, if the old spoils remained with
him. To give an illustration: If a hostile force had overcome certain
\[enemies\], had bound them, and led them away captive, and held them
for a long time in servitude, so that they begat children among them;
and somebody, compassionating those who had been made slaves, should
overcome this same hostile force; he certainly would not act equitably,
were he to liberate the children of those who had been led captive, from
the sway of those who had enslaved their fathers, but should leave these
latter, who had suffered the act of capture, subject to their
enemies,—those, too, on whose very account he had proceeded to this
retaliation,— the children succeeding to liberty through the avenging of
their fathers’ cause, but not <span id="fr_3758"></span>[3759](#fn_3758.md)
so that their fathers, who suffered the act of capture itself, should be
left \[in bondage\]. For God is neither devoid of power nor of justice,
who has afforded help to man, and restored him to His own liberty.

<span id="ix.iv.xxiv-p7"></span>3. It was for this reason, too, that
immediately after Adam had transgressed, as the Scripture relates, He
pronounced no curse against Adam personally, but against the ground, in
reference to his works, as a certain person among the ancients has
observed: “God did indeed transfer the curse to the earth, that it might
not remain in man.” <span id="fr_3759"></span>[3760](#fn_3759.md) But man
received, as the punishment of his transgression, the toilsome task of
tilling the earth, and to eat bread in the sweat of his face, and to
return to the dust from whence he was taken. Similarly also did the
woman \[receive\] toil, and labour, and groans, and the pangs of
parturition, and a state of subjection, that is, that she should serve
her husband; so that they should neither perish altogether when cursed
by God, nor, by remaining unreprimanded, should be led to despise God.
<span id="ix.iv.xxiv-p8.2"></span>But the curse in all its fulness fell
upon the serpent, which had beguiled them. “And God,” it is declared,
“said to the serpent: Because thou hast done this, cursed art thou above
all cattle, and above all the beasts of the earth.” <span
id="fr_3760"></span>[3761](#fn_3760.md) And this same thing does the Lord
also say in the Gospel, to those who are found upon the left hand:
“Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, which my Father hath
prepared for the devil and his angels;” <span
id="fr_3761"></span>[3762](#fn_3761.md) indicating that eternal fire was
not originally prepared for man, but for him who beguiled man, and
caused him to offend—for him, I say, who is chief of the apostasy, and
for those angels who became apostates along with him; which \[fire\],
indeed, they too shall justly feel, who, like him, persevere in works of
wickedness, without repentance, and without retracing their steps.

<span id="ix.iv.xxiv-p11"></span>4. <span id="ix.iv.xxiv-p11.1"></span>
\[These act\] <span id="fr_3762"></span>[3763](#fn_3762.md) as Cain \[did,
who\], when he was counselled by God to keep quiet, because he had not
made an equitable division of that share to which his brother was
entitled, but with envy and malice thought that he could domineer over
him, not only did not acquiesce, but even added sin to sin, indicating
his state of mind by his action. For what he had planned, that did he
also put in practice: he tyrannized over and slew him; God subjecting
the just to the unjust, that the former might be proved as the just one
by the things which he suffered, and the latter detected as the unjust
by those which he perpetrated. And he was not softened even by this, nor
did he stop short with that evil deed; but being asked where his brother
was, he said, “I know not; am I my brother’s keeper?” extending and
aggravating \[his\] wickedness by his answer. For if it is wicked to
slay a brother, much worse is it thus insolently and irreverently to
reply to the omniscient God as if he could battle Him. And for this he
did himself bear a curse about with him, because he gratuitously brought
<span id="page_457">p. 457</span> <span id="ix.iv.xxiv-Page_457"></span>
an offering of sin, having had no reverence for God, nor being put to
confusion by the act of fratricide. <span
id="fr_3763"></span>[3764](#fn_3763.md)

<span id="ix.iv.xxiv-p14"></span>5. The case of Adam, however, had no
analogy with this, but was altogether different. For, having been
beguiled by another under the pretext of immortality, he is immediately
seized with terror, and hides himself; not as if he were able to escape
from God; but, in a state of confusion at having transgressed His
command, he feels unworthy to appear before and to hold converse with
God. Now, “the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom;” <span
id="fr_3764"></span>[3765](#fn_3764.md) the sense of sin leads to
repentance, and God bestows His compassion upon those who are penitent.
<span id="ix.iv.xxiv-p15.3"></span>For \[Adam\] showed his repentance by
his conduct, through means of the girdle \[which he used\], covering
himself with fig-leaves, while there were many other leaves, which would
have irritated his body in a less degree. He, however, adopted a dress
conformable to his disobedience, being awed by the fear of God; and
resisting the erring, the lustful propensity of his flesh (since he had
lost his natural disposition and child-like mind, and had come to the
knowledge of evil things), he girded a bridle of continence upon himself
and his wife, fearing God, and waiting for His coming, and indicating,
as it were, some such thing \[as follows\]: Inasmuch as, he says, I have
by disobedience lost that robe of sanctity which I had from the Spirit,
I do now also acknowledge that I am deserving of a covering of this
nature, which affords no gratification, but which gnaws and frets the
body. And he would no doubt have retained this clothing for ever, thus
humbling himself, if God, who is merciful, had not clothed them with
tunics of skins instead of fig-leaves. For this purpose, too, He
interrogates them, that the blame might light upon the woman; and again,
He interrogates her, that she might convey the blame to the serpent. For
she related what had occurred. “The serpent,” says she, “beguiled me,
and I did eat.” <span id="fr_3765"></span>[3766](#fn_3765.md) But He put no
question to the serpent; for He knew that he had been the prime mover in
the guilty deed; but He pronounced the curse upon him in the first
instance, that it might fall upon man with a mitigated rebuke. For God
detested him who had led man astray, but by degrees, and little by
little, He showed compassion to him who had been beguiled.

<span id="ix.iv.xxiv-p17"></span>6. <span
id="ix.iv.xxiv-p17.1"></span>Wherefore also He drove him out of
Paradise, and removed him far from the tree of life, not because He
envied him the tree of life, as some venture to assert, but because He
pitied him, \[and did not desire\] that he should continue a sinner for
ever, nor that the sin which surrounded him should be immortal, and evil
interminable and irremediable. But He set a bound to his \[state of\]
sin, by interposing death, and thus causing sin to cease, <span
id="fr_3766"></span>[3767](#fn_3766.md) putting an end to it by the
dissolution of the flesh, which should take place in the earth, so that
man, ceasing at length to live to sin, and dying to it, might begin to
live to God.

<span id="ix.iv.xxiv-p19"></span>7. <span
id="ix.iv.xxiv-p19.1"></span>For this end did He put enmity between the
serpent and the woman and her seed, they keeping it up mutually: He, the
sole of whose foot should be bitten, having power also to tread upon the
enemy’s head; but the other biting, killing, and impeding the steps of
man, until the seed did come appointed to tread down his head,—which was
born of Mary, of whom the prophet speaks: “Thou shalt tread upon the asp
and the basilisk; thou shalt trample down the lion and the
dragon;” <span id="fr_3767"></span>[3768](#fn_3767.md) —indicating that
sin, which was set up and spread out against man, and which rendered him
subject to death, should be deprived of its power, along with death,
which rules \[over men\]; and that the lion, that is, antichrist,
rampant against mankind in the latter days, should be trampled down by
Him; and that He should bind “the dragon, that old serpent” <span
id="fr_3768"></span>[3769](#fn_3768.md) and subject him to the power of
man, who had been conquered <span id="fr_3769"></span>[3770](#fn_3769.md)
so that all his might should be trodden down. Now Adam had been
conquered, all life having been taken away from him: wherefore, when the
foe was conquered in his turn, Adam received new life; and the last
enemy, death, is destroyed, <span id="fr_3770"></span>[3771](#fn_3770.md)
which at the first had taken possession of man. Therefore, when man has
been liberated, “what is written shall come to pass, Death is swallowed
up in victory. O death, where is thy sting?” <span
id="fr_3771"></span>[3772](#fn_3771.md) This could not be said with
justice, if that man, over whom death did first obtain dominion, were
not set free. For his salvation is death’s destruction. When therefore
the Lord vivifies man, that is, Adam, death is at the same time
destroyed.

<span id="ix.iv.xxiv-p25"></span>8. <span
id="ix.iv.xxiv-p25.1"></span>All therefore speak falsely who disallow
his (Adam’s) salvation, shutting themselves out from life for ever, in
that they do not believe that the sheep which had perished has been
found. <span id="fr_3772"></span>[3773](#fn_3772.md) For if it has not been
found, the whole human race is still held in a state of perdition.
False, therefore, is that, man who first started this idea, or rather,
this ignorance and blindness—Tatian. <span
id="fr_3773"></span>[3774](#fn_3773.md) <span id="page_458">p. 458</span>
<span id="ix.iv.xxiv-Page_458"></span> As I have already indicated, this
man entangled himself with all the heretics. <span
id="fr_3774"></span>[3775](#fn_3774.md) This dogma, however, has been
invented by himself, in order that, by introducing something new,
independently of the rest, and by speaking vanity, he might acquire for
himself hearers void of faith, affecting to be esteemed a teacher, and
endeavouring from time to time to employ sayings of this kind often
\[made use of\] by Paul: “In Adam we all die;” <span
id="fr_3775"></span>[3776](#fn_3775.md) ignorant, however, that “where sin
abounded, grace did much more abound.” <span
id="fr_3776"></span>[3777](#fn_3776.md) Since this, then, has been clearly
shown, let all his disciples be put to shame, and let them wrangle <span
id="fr_3777"></span>[3778](#fn_3777.md) about Adam, as if some great gain
were to accrue to them if he be not saved; when they profit nothing more
\[by that\], even as the serpent also did not profit when persuading man
\[to sin\], except to this effect, that he proved him a transgressor,
obtaining man as the first-fruits of his own apostasy. <span
id="fr_3778"></span>[3779](#fn_3778.md) But he did not know God’s
power. <span id="fr_3779"></span>[3780](#fn_3779.md) Thus also do those who
disallow Adam’s salvation gain nothing, except this, that they render
themselves heretics and apostates from the truth, and show themselves
patrons of the serpent and of death.
