<span id="ix.iii.xxii"></span>

### <span id="ix.iii.xxii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXI.—The twelve apostles were not a type of the Æons.

<span id="ix.iii.xxii-p1"></span>1. <span
id="ix.iii.xxii-p1.1"></span><span id="ix.iii.xxii-p1.2"></span>If,
again, they maintain that the twelve apostles were a type only of that
group of twelve Æons which Anthropos in conjunction with Ecclesia
produced, then let them produce ten other apostles as a type of those
ten remaining Æons, who, as they declare, were produced by Logos and
Zoe. For it is unreasonable to suppose that the junior, and for that
reason inferior Æons, were set forth by the Saviour through the election
of the apostles, while their seniors, and on this account their
superiors, were not thus foreshown; since the Saviour (if, that is to
say, He chose the apostles with this view, that by means of them He
might show forth the Æons who are in the Pleroma) might have chosen
other ten apostles also, and likewise other eight before these, that
thus He might set forth the original and primary Ogdoad. He could
not, <span id="fr_3108"></span>[3109](#fn_3108.md) in regard to the second
\[Duo\] Decad, show forth \[any emblem of it\] through the number of the
apostles being \[already\] constituted a type. For \[He made choice of
no such other number of disciples; but\] after the twelve apostles, our
Lord is found to have sent seventy others before Him. <span
id="fr_3109"></span>[3110](#fn_3109.md) Now *seventy* cannot possibly be
the type either of an Ogdoad, a Decad, or a Triacontad. What is the
reason, then, that the inferior Æons are, as I have said, represented by
means of the apostles; but the superior, from whom, too, the former
derived their being, are not prefigured at all? But if <span
id="fr_3110"></span>[3111](#fn_3110.md) the twelve apostles were chosen
with this object, that the number of the twelve Æons might be indicated
by means of them, then the seventy also ought to have been chosen to be
the type of seventy Æons; and in that case, they must affirm that the
Æons are no longer thirty, but eighty-two in number. For He who made
choice of the apostles, that they might be a type of those Æons existing
in the Pleroma, would never have constituted them types of some and not
of others; but by means of the apostles He would have tried to preserve
an image and to exhibit a type of those Æons that exist in the Pleroma.

<span id="ix.iii.xxii-p5"></span>2. Moreover we must not keep silence
respecting Paul, but demand from them after the type of what Æon that
apostle has been handed down to us, unless perchance \[they affirm that
he is a representative\] of the Saviour compounded of them \[all\], who
derived his being from the collected gifts of the whole, and whom they
term *All Things*, as having been formed out of them all. Respecting
this being the poet Hesiod has strikingly expressed himself, styling him
Pandora —that is, “The gift of all”—for this reason, that the best gift
in the possession of all was centred in him. In describing these gifts
the following account is given: Hermes (so <span
id="fr_3111"></span>[3112](#fn_3111.md) he is called in the Greek
language), <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii.xxii-p6.1"></span>Αἱμυλίους</span> <span
id="fr_3112"></span>[3113](#fn_3112.md) <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iii.xxii-p7.1"></span>τε λόγους καὶ ἐπίκλοπον ἦθος αὐτοὺς
Κάτθετο</span> (or to express this in the English <span
id="fr_3113"></span>[3114](#fn_3113) language.md), “implanted words of
fraud and deceit in their minds, and thievish habits,” for the purpose
of leading foolish men astray, that such should believe their
falsehoods. For their Mother—that is, Leto <span
id="fr_3114"></span>[3115](#fn_3114.md) —secretly stirred them up (whence
also she is called Leto, <span id="fr_3115"></span>[3116](#fn_3115.md)
according to the meaning of the Greek word, because she *secretly*
stirred up men), without the knowledge of the Demiurge, to give forth
profound and unspeakable mysteries to itching ears. <span
id="fr_3116"></span>[3117](#fn_3116.md) And not only did their Mother bring
it about that this mystery should be declared by Hesiod; but very
skilfully also by means of the lyric poet Pindar, when he describes to
the Demiurge <span id="fr_3117"></span>[3118](#fn_3117.md) the <span
id="page_390">p. 390</span> <span id="ix.iii.xxii-Page_390"></span> case
of Pelops, whose flesh was cut in pieces by the Father, and then
collected and brought together, and compacted anew by all the
gods, <span id="fr_3118"></span>[3119](#fn_3118.md) did she in this way
indicate Pandora and these men having their consciences seared <span
id="fr_3119"></span>[3120](#fn_3119.md) by her, declaring, as they
maintain, the very same things, are \[proved\] of the same family and
spirit as the others.

<span id="fn_3108"></span>[389:3109](0010751.htm#fr_3108.md) <span
id="ix.iii.xxii-p1.3"></span>

<span id="ix.iii.xxii-p2"></span> This passage is hopelessly corrupt.
The editors have twisted it in every direction, but with no satisfactory
result. Our version is quite as far from being certainly trustworthy as
any other that has been proposed, but it seems something like the
meaning of the words as they stand. Both the text and punctuation of the
Latin are in utter confusion.

<span id="ix.iii.xxii-p4"></span> “Si” is wanting in the <span

clearer through inserting it.

<span id="ix.iii.xxii-p6"></span> This clause is, of course, an
interpolation by the Latin translator.

<span id="ix.iii.xxii-p7"></span> The words are loosely quoted
*memoriter*, as is the custom with Irenæus. See Hesiod, *Works and
Days*, i. 77, etc.

<span id="ix.iii.xxii-p9"></span> There is here a play upon the words

<span class="Greek"><span id="ix.iii.xxii-p9.2"></span>ληθεῖν</span>,
the former being supposed to be derived from the latter, so as to denote
*secrecy*.

<span id="ix.iii.xxii-p10"></span> This clause is probably an
interpolation by the translator.

<span id="ix.iii.xxii-p12"></span> “Cœlet Demiurgo,” such is the reading
in all the <span class="upper"><span
id="ix.iii.xxii-p12.1"></span>mss</span>. and editions. Harvey, however,
proposes to read “celet Demiurgum;” but the change which he suggests,
besides being without authority, does not clear away the obscurity which
hangs upon the sentence.

The whole passage is difficult and obscure.
