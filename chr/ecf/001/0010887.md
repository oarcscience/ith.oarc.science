<span id="ix.viii.xii-p1"></span><span id="ix.viii.xii-p1.1"></span>We
therefore have formed the belief that \[our\] bodies also do rise again.
For although they go to corruption, yet they do not perish; for the
earth, receiving the remains, preserves them, even like fertile seed
mixed with more fertile ground. Again, as a bare grain is sown, and,
germinating by the command of God its Creator, rises again, clothed upon
and glorious, but not before it has died and suffered decomposition, and
become mingled with the earth; so \[it is seen from this, that\] we have
not entertained a vain belief in the resurrection of the body. But
although it is dissolved at the appointed time, because of the primeval
disobedience, it is placed, as it were, in the crucible of the earth, to
be recast again; not then as this corruptible \[body\], but pure, and no
longer subject to decay: so that to each body its own soul shall be
restored; and when it is clothed upon with this, it shall not experience
sorrow, but shall rejoice, continuing permanently in a state of purity,
having for its companion a just consort, not an insidious one,
possessing in every respect the things pertaining to it, it shall
receive these with perfect accuracy; <span
id="fr_4814"></span>[4815](#fn_4814) it shall not receive bodies diverse
from what they had been, nor delivered from suffering or disease, nor as
\[rendered\] glorious, but as they departed this life, in sins or in
righteous actions: and such as they were, such shall they be clothed
with upon resuming life; and such as they were in unbelief, such shall
they be faithfully judged.

incomplete; we have followed the conjectural restoration of Harvey.
