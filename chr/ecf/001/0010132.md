### <span id="v.ii.ix-p0.1"></span>Chapter IX.—Ye have given no heed to false teachers.

<span id="v.ii.ix-p1"></span><span id="v.ii.ix-p1.1"></span><span
id="v.ii.ix-p1.2"></span><span id="v.ii.ix-p1.3"></span><span
id="v.ii.ix-p1.4"></span>Nevertheless, I have heard of some who have
passed on from this to you, having false doctrine, whom ye did not
suffer to sow among you, but stopped your ears, that ye might not
receive those things which were sown by them, as being stones <span
id="fr_541"></span>[542](#fn_541) of the temple of the Father, prepared
for the building of God the Father, and drawn up on high by the
instrument of Jesus Christ, which is the cross, <span
id="fr_542"></span>[543](#fn_542) making use of the Holy Spirit as a
rope, while your faith was the means by which you ascended, and your
love the way which led up to God. <span id="v.ii.ix-p3.2"></span>Ye,
therefore, as well as all your fellow-travellers, are God-bearers,
temple-bearers, Christ-bearers, bearers of holiness, adorned in all
respects with the commandments of Jesus Christ, in whom also I exult
that I have been thought worthy, by means of this Epistle, to converse
and rejoice with you, because with respect to your Christian life <span
id="fr_543"></span>[544](#fn_543) ye love nothing but God only.

<span id="v.ii.ix-p5"></span><span id="v.ii.ix-p5.1"></span><span
id="v.ii.ix-p5.2"></span><span id="v.ii.ix-p5.3"></span>Nevertheless, I
have heard of some who have passed in among you, holding the wicked
doctrine of the strange and evil spirit; to whom ye did not allow
entrance to sow their tares, but stopped your ears that ye might not
receive that error which was proclaimed by them, as being persuaded that
that spirit which deceives the people does not speak the things of
Christ, but his own, for he is a lying spirit. <span
id="v.ii.ix-p5.4"></span>But the Holy Spirit does not speak His own
things, but those of Christ, and that not from himself, but from the
Lord; even as the Lord also announced to us the things that He received
from the Father. For, says He, “the word which ye hear is not Mine, but
the Father’s, who sent Me.” <span id="fr_544"></span>[545](#fn_544) And
says He of the Holy Spirit, “He shall not speak of Himself, but
whatsoever things He shall hear from Me.” <span
id="fr_545"></span>[546](#fn_545) And He says of Himself to the Father,
“I have,” says He, “glorified Thee upon the earth; I have finished the
work which, Thou gavest Me; I have manifested Thy name to men.” <span
id="fr_546"></span>[547](#fn_546) And of the Holy Ghost, “He shall
glorify Me, for He receives of Mine.” <span
id="fr_547"></span>[548](#fn_547) But the spirit of deceit preaches
himself, and speaks his own things, for he seeks to please himself. He
glorifies himself, for he is full of arrogance. He is lying, fraudulent,
soothing, flattering, treacherous, rhapsodical, trifling, inharmonious,
verbose, sordid, and timorous. From his power Jesus Christ will deliver
you, who has founded you upon the rock, as being chosen stones, well
fitted for the divine edifice of the Father, and who are raised up on
high by Christ, who was crucified for you, making use of the Holy Spirit
as a rope, and being borne up by faith, while exalted by love from earth
to heaven, walking in company with those that are undefiled. For, says
\[the Scripture\], “Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in
the law of the Lord.” <span id="fr_548"></span>[549](#fn_548) Now the
way is unerring, namely, Jesus Christ. For, says He, “I am the way and
the life.” <span id="fr_549"></span>[550](#fn_549) And this way leads to
the Father. For “no man,” says He, “cometh to the Father but by
Me.” <span id="fr_550"></span>[551](#fn_550) <span
id="v.ii.ix-p12.2"></span>Blessed, then, are ye who are God-bearers,
spirit-bearers, temple-bearers, bearers of holiness, adorned in all
respects with the commandments of Jesus Christ, being “a royal
priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people,” <span
id="fr_551"></span>[552](#fn_551) on whose account I rejoice
exceedingly, and have had the privilege, by this Epistle, of conversing
with “the saints which are at Ephesus, the faithful in Christ
Jesus.” <span id="fr_552"></span>[553](#fn_552) I rejoice, therefore,
over you, that ye do not give heed to vanity, and love nothing according
to the flesh, but according to God.
