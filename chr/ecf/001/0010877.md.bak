### <span id="ix.viii.ii-p0.1"></span>II.

<span id="ix.viii.ii-p1"></span><span
id="ix.viii.ii-p1.1"></span>These <span
id="fr_4797"></span>[4798](#fn_4797.md) opinions, Florinus, that I may
speak in mild terms, are not of sound doctrine; these opinions are not
consonant to the Church, and involve their votaries in the utmost
impiety; these opinions, even the heretics beyond the Church’s pale have
never ventured to broach; these opinions, those presbyters who preceded
us, and who were conversant with the apostles, did not hand down to
thee. For, while I was yet a boy, I saw thee in Lower Asia with
Polycarp, distinguishing thyself in the royal court, <span
id="fr_4798"></span>[4799](#fn_4798.md) and endeavouring to gain his
approbation. For I have a more vivid recollection of what occurred at
that time than of recent events (inasmuch as the experiences of
childhood, keeping pace with the growth of the soul, become incorporated
with it); so that I can even describe the place where the blessed
Polycarp used to sit and discourse— his going out, too, and his coming
in—his general mode of life and personal appearance, together with the
discourses which he delivered to the people; also how he would speak of
his familiar intercourse with John, and with the rest of those who had
seen the Lord; and how he would call their words to remembrance.
Whatsoever things he had heard from them respecting the Lord, both with
regard to His miracles and His teaching, Polycarp having thus received
\[information\] from the eye-witnesses of the Word of life, would
recount them all in harmony with the Scriptures. These things, through,
God’s mercy which was upon me, I then listened to attentively, and
treasured them up not on paper, but in my heart; and I am continually,
by God’s grace, revolving these things accurately in my mind. And I can
bear witness before God, that if that blessed and apostolical presbyter
had heard any such thing, he would have cried out, and stopped his ears,
exclaiming as he was wont to do: “O good God, for what times hast Thou
reserved me, that I should endure these things?” And he would have fled
from the very spot where, sitting or standing, he had heard such words.
This fact, too, can be made clear, from his Epistles which he
despatched, whether to the neighbouring Churches to confirm them, or to
certain of the brethren, admonishing and exhorting them.

<span id="ix.viii.ii-p2"></span> This interesting extract we also owe to
Eusebius, who (*ut sup.*) took it from the work *De Ogdoade*, written
after this former friend of Irenæus had lapsed to Valentinianism.
Florinus had previously held that God was the author of evil, which
sentiment Irenæus opposed in a treatise, now lost, called <span
