### <span id="ix.vii.xviii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVII.—There is but one Lord and one God, the Father and Creator of all things, who has loved us in Christ, given us commandments, and remitted our sins; whose Son and Word Christ proved Himself to be, when He forgave our sins.

<span id="ix.vii.xviii-p1"></span>1. <span
id="ix.vii.xviii-p1.1"></span><span id="ix.vii.xviii-p1.2"></span>Now
this being is the Creator (*Demiurgus*), who is, in respect of His love,
the Father; but in respect of His power, He is Lord; and in respect of
His wisdom, our Maker and Fashioner; by transgressing whose commandment
we became His enemies. And therefore in the last times the Lord has
restored us into friendship through His incarnation, having become “the
Mediator between God and men;” <span
id="fr_4589"></span>[4590](#fn_4589.md) propitiating indeed for us the
Father against whom we had sinned, and cancelling (*consolatus*) our
disobedience by His own obedience; conferring also upon us the gift of
communion with, and subjection to, our Maker. <span
id="ix.vii.xviii-p2.2"></span><span id="ix.vii.xviii-p2.3"></span>For
this reason also He has taught us to say in prayer, “And forgive us our
debts;” <span id="fr_4590"></span>[4591](#fn_4590.md) since indeed He is
our Father, whose debtors we were, having transgressed His commandments.
But who is this Being? Is He some unknown one, and a Father who gives no
commandment <span id="page_545">p. 545</span> <span
id="ix.vii.xviii-Page_545"></span> to any one? Or is He the God who is
proclaimed in the Scriptures, to whom we were debtors, having
transgressed His commandment? Now the commandment was given to man by
the Word. For Adam, it is said, “heard the voice of the <span
class="upper"><span id="ix.vii.xviii-p3.2"></span>Lord</span>
God.” <span id="fr_4591"></span>[4592](#fn_4591.md) Rightly then does His
Word say to man, “Thy sins are forgiven thee;” <span
id="fr_4592"></span>[4593](#fn_4592.md) He, the same against whom we had
sinned in the beginning, grants forgiveness of sins in the end. But if
indeed we had disobeyed the command of any other, while it was a
different being who said, “Thy sins are forgiven thee;” <span
id="fr_4593"></span>[4594](#fn_4593.md) such an one is neither good, nor
true, nor just. For how can he be good, who does not give from what
belongs to himself? Or how can he be just, who snatches away the goods
of another? And in what way can sins be truly remitted, unless that He
against whom we have sinned has Himself granted remission “through the
bowels of mercy of our God,” in which “He has visited us” <span
id="fr_4594"></span>[4595](#fn_4594.md) through His Son?

<span id="ix.vii.xviii-p8"></span>2. And therefore, when He had healed
the man sick of the palsy, \[the evangelist\] says “The people upon
seeing it glorified God, who gave such power unto men.” <span
id="fr_4595"></span>[4596](#fn_4595.md) What God, then, did the bystanders
glorify? Was it indeed that unknown Father invented by the heretics? And
how could they glorify him who was altogether unknown to them? It is
evident, therefore, that the Israelites glorified Him who has been
proclaimed as God by the law and the prophets, who is also the Father of
our Lord; and therefore He taught men, by the evidence of their senses
through those signs which He accomplished, to give glory to God. If,
however, He Himself had come from another Father, and men glorified a
different Father when they beheld His miracles, He \[in that case\]
rendered them ungrateful to that Father who had sent the gift of
healing. But as the only-begotten Son had come for man’s salvation from
Him who is God, He did both stir up the incredulous by the miracles
which He was in the habit of working, to give glory to the Father; and
to the Pharisees, who did not admit the advent of His Son, and who
consequently did not believe in the remission \[of sins\] which was
conferred by Him, He said, “That ye may know that the Son of man hath
power to forgive sins.” <span id="fr_4596"></span>[4597](#fn_4596.md) And
when He had said this, He commanded the paralytic man to take up the
pallet upon which he was lying, and go into his house. By this work of
His He confounded the unbelievers, and showed that He is Himself the
voice of God, by which man received commandments, which he broke, and
became a sinner; for the paralysis followed as a consequence of sins.

<span id="ix.vii.xviii-p11"></span>3. Therefore, by remitting sins, He
did indeed heal man, while He also manifested Himself who He was. For if
no one can forgive sins but God alone, while the Lord remitted them and
healed men, it is plain that He was Himself the Word of God made the Son
of man, receiving from the Father the power of remission of sins; since
He was man, and since He was God, in order that since as man He suffered
for us, so as God He might have compassion on us, and forgive us our
debts, in which we were made debtors to God our Creator. And therefore
David said beforehand, “Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven,
and whose sins are covered. Blessed is the man to whom the <span
class="upper"><span id="ix.vii.xviii-p11.1"></span>Lord</span> has not
imputed sin;” <span id="fr_4597"></span>[4598](#fn_4597.md) pointing out
thus that remission of sins which follows upon His advent, by which “He
has destroyed the handwriting” of our debt, and “fastened it to the
cross;” <span id="fr_4598"></span>[4599](#fn_4598.md) so that as by means
of a tree we were made debtors to God, \[so also\] by means of a tree we
may obtain the remission of our debt.

<span id="ix.vii.xviii-p14"></span>4. <span
id="ix.vii.xviii-p14.1"></span>This fact has been strikingly set forth
by many others, and especially through means of Elisha the prophet. For
when his fellow-prophets were hewing wood for the construction of a
tabernacle, and when the iron \[head\], shaken loose from the axe, had
fallen into the Jordan and could not be found by them, upon Elisha’s
coming to the place, and learning what had happened, he threw some wood
into the water. Then, when he had done this, the iron part of the axe
floated up, and they took up from the surface of the water what they had
previously lost. <span id="fr_4599"></span>[4600](#fn_4599.md) By this
action the prophet pointed out that the sure word of God, which we had
negligently lost by means of a tree, and were not in the way of finding
again, we should receive anew by the dispensation of a tree, \[viz., the
cross of Christ\]. For that the word of God is likened to an axe, John
the Baptist declares \[when he says\] in reference to it, “But now also
is the axe laid to the root of the trees.” <span
id="fr_4600"></span>[4601](#fn_4600.md) Jeremiah also says to the same
purport: “The word of God cleaveth the rock as an axe.” <span
id="fr_4601"></span>[4602](#fn_4601.md) This word, then, what was hidden
from us, did the dispensation of the tree make manifest, as I have
already remarked. For as we lost it by means of a tree, by means of a
tree again was it made manifest to all, showing the height, the length,
the breadth, the depth in itself; and, as a certain man among our
predecessors observed, “Through the extension of the hands of a divine
person, <span id="fr_4602"></span>[4603](#fn_4602.md) gathering together
the two peoples to one God.” <span id="page_546">p. 546</span> <span
id="ix.vii.xviii-Page_546"></span> For these were two hands, because
there were two peoples scattered to the ends of the earth; but there was
one head in the middle, as there is but one God, who is above all, and
through all, and in us all.
