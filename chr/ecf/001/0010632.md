### <span id="viii.vi.xxii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXII.—Studied ambiguity Plato.

<span id="viii.vi.xxii-p1"></span><span

accordingly having learned this in Egypt, and being greatly taken with
what was said about one God, did indeed consider it unsafe to mention
the name of Moses, on account of his teaching the doctrine of one only
God, for he dreaded the Areopagus; but what is very well expressed by
him in his elaborate treatise, the *Timæus*, he has written in exact
correspondence with what Moses said regarding God, though he has done
so, not as if he had learned it from him, but as if he were expressing
his own opinion. For he said, “In my opinion, then, we must first define
what that is which exists eternally, and has no generation, <span
id="fr_2550"></span>[2551](#fn_2550) and what that is which is always
being generated, but never really is.” Does not this, ye men of Greece,
seem to those who are able to understand the matter to be one and the
same thing, saving only the difference of the article? For Moses said,
“*He* who is,” and Plato, “That which is.” But either of the expressions
seems to apply to the ever-existent God. For He is the only one who
eternally exists, and has no generation. What, then, that other thing is
which is contrasted with the ever-existent, and of which he said, “And
what that is which is always being generated, but never really is,” we
must attentively consider. For we shall find him clearly and evidently
saying that He who is unbegotten is eternal, but that those that are
begotten and made are generated and perish <span
id="fr_2551"></span>[2552](#fn_2551) —as he said of the same class,
“gods of gods, of whom I am maker”—for he speaks in the following words:
“In my opinion, then, we must first define what that is which is always
existent and has no birth, and what that is which is always being
generated but never really is. The former, indeed, which is apprehended
by reflection combined with reason, always exists in the same way; <span
id="fr_2552"></span>[2553](#fn_2552) while the latter, on the other
hand, is conjectured by opinion formed by the perception of the senses
unaided by reason, since it never really is, but is coming into being
and perishing.” These expressions declare to those who can rightly
understand them the death and destruction of the gods that have been
brought into being. And I think it necessary to attend to this also,
that Plato never names him the creator, but the fashioner <span
id="fr_2553"></span>[2554](#fn_2553) of the gods, although, in the
opinion of Plato, there is considerable difference between these two.
For the creator creates the creature by his own capability and power,
being in need of nothing else; but the fashioner frames his production
when he has received from matter the capability for his work.
