### <span id="v.xii.ii-p0.1"></span>Chapter II.

<span id="v.xii.ii-p1"></span>For there is no other time such as this,
that I should be accounted worthy of God; neither will ye, if ye be
silent, \[ever\] be found in a better work than this. If ye let me
alone, I shall be the word of God; but if ye love my flesh, again am I
\[only\] to myself a voice. Ye cannot give me anything more precious
than this, that I should be sacrificed to God, while the altar is ready;
that ye may be in one concord in love, and may praise God the Father
through Jesus Christ our Lord, because He has deemed a bishop worthy to
be God’s, having called him from the east to the west. It is good that I
should set from the world in God, that I may rise in Him to life. <span
