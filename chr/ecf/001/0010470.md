### <span id="viii.iv.ix-p0.1"></span>Chapter IX.—The Christians have not believed groundless stories.

<span id="viii.iv.ix-p1"></span><span id="viii.iv.ix-p1.1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.ix-p1.2"></span><span id="viii.iv.ix-p1.3"></span>“I excuse
and forgive you, my friend,” I said. “For you know not what you say, but
have been persuaded by teachers who do not understand the Scriptures;
and you speak, like a diviner, whatever comes into your mind. But if you
are willing to listen to an account of Him, how we have not been
deceived, and shall not cease to confess Him,—although men’s reproaches
be heaped upon us, although the most terrible tyrant compel us to deny
Him,—I shall prove to you as you stand here that we have not believed
empty fables, or words without any foundation but words filled with the
Spirit of God, and big with power, and flourishing with grace.”

<span id="viii.iv.ix-p2"></span>Then again those who were in his company
laughed, and shouted in an unseemly manner. Then I rose up and was about
to leave; but he, taking hold of my garment, said I should not
accomplish that <span id="fr_1966"></span>[1967](#fn_1966) until I had
performed what I promised. “Let not, then, your companions be so
tumultuous, or behave so disgracefully,” I said. “But if they wish, let
them listen in silence; or, if some better occupation prevent them, let
them go away; while we, having retired to some spot, and resting there,
may finish the discourse.” It seemed good to Trypho that we should do
so; and accordingly, having agreed upon it, we retired to the middle
space of the Xystus. Two of his friends, when they had ridiculed and
made game of our zeal, went off. And when we were come to that place,
where there are stone seats on both sides, those with Trypho, having
seated themselves on the one side, conversed with each other, some one
of them having thrown in a remark about the war waged in Judæa.
