### <span id="v.iv.x-p0.1"></span>Chapter X.—The reality of Christ’s passion.

<span id="v.iv.x-p1"></span><span id="v.iv.x-p1.1"></span><span
id="v.iv.x-p1.2"></span>But if, as some that are without God, that is,
the unbelieving, say, that He only seemed to suffer (they themselves
only seeming to exist), then why am I in bonds? Why do I long to be
exposed to <span id="fr_795"></span>[796](#fn_795) the wild beasts? Do I
therefore die in vain? <span id="fr_796"></span>[797](#fn_796) Am I not
then guilty of falsehood <span id="fr_797"></span>[798](#fn_797) against
\[the cross of\] the Lord?

<span id="v.iv.x-p5"></span><span id="v.iv.x-p5.1"></span><span
id="v.iv.x-p5.2"></span><span id="v.iv.x-p5.3"></span>But if, as some
that are without God, that is, the unbelieving, say, He became man in
appearance \[only\], that He did not in reality take unto Him a body,
that He died in appearance \[merely\], and did not in very deed suffer,
then for what reason am I now in bonds, and long to be exposed to <span
id="fr_798"></span>[799](#fn_798) the wild beasts? In such a case, I die
in vain, and am guilty of falsehood <span
id="fr_799"></span>[800](#fn_799) against the cross of the Lord. Then
also does the prophet in vain declare, “They shall look on Him whom they
have pierced, and mourn over themselves as over one beloved.” <span
id="fr_800"></span>[801](#fn_800) These men, therefore, are not less
unbelievers than were those that crucified Him. But as for me, I do not
place my hopes in one who died for me in appearance, but in reality. For
that which is false is quite abhorrent to the truth. <span
id="v.iv.x-p8.2"></span>Mary then did truly conceive a body which had
God inhabiting it. And God the Word was truly born of the Virgin, having
clothed Himself with a body of like passions with our own. He who forms
all men in the womb, was Himself really in the womb, and made for
Himself a body of the seed of the Virgin, but without any intercourse of
man. He was carried in the womb, even as we are, for the usual period of
time; and was really born, as we also are; and was in reality nourished
with milk, and partook of common meat and drink, even as we do. And when
He had lived among men for thirty years, He was baptized by John, really
and not in appearance; and when He had preached the Gospel three years,
and done signs and wonders, He who was Himself the Judge was judged by
the Jews, falsely so called, and by Pilate the governor; was scourged,
was smitten on the cheek, was spit upon; He wore a crown of thorns and a
purple robe; He was condemned: He was crucified in reality, and not in
appearance, not in imagination, not in deceit. <span
id="v.iv.x-p8.3"></span><span id="v.iv.x-p8.4"></span>He really died,
and was buried, and rose from the dead, even as He prayed in a certain
place, saying, “But do Thou, O Lord, raise me up again, and I shall
recompense them.” <span id="fr_801"></span>[802](#fn_801) And the
Father, who always hears Him, <span id="fr_802"></span>[803](#fn_802)
answered and said, “Arise, O God, and judge the earth; for Thou shall
receive all the heathen for Thine inheritance.” <span
id="fr_803"></span>[804](#fn_803) The Father, therefore, who raised Him
up, will also raise us up through Him, apart from whom no one will
attain to true life. For says He, “I am the life; he that believeth in
me, even though he die, shall live: and every one that liveth and
believeth in me, even though he die, shall live for ever.” <span
id="fr_804"></span>[805](#fn_804) Do ye therefore flee from these
ungodly heresies; for they are the inventions of the devil, that serpent
who was the author of evil, and who by means of the woman deceived Adam,
the father of our race.
