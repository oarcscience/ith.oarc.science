### <span id="viii.ii.xlviii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XLVIII.—Christ’s work and death foretold.

<span id="viii.ii.xlviii-p1"></span><span
id="viii.ii.xlviii-p1.1"></span>And that it was predicted that our
Christ <span id="page_179">p. 179</span> <span
id="viii.ii.xlviii-Page_179"></span> should heal all diseases and raise
the dead, hear what was said. <span
id="viii.ii.xlviii-p1.2"></span>There are these words: “At His coming
the lame shall leap as an hart, and the tongue of the stammerer shall be
clear speaking: the blind shall see, and the lepers shall be cleansed;
and the dead shall rise, and walk about.” <span
id="fr_1866"></span>[1867](#fn_1866.md) And that He did those things, you
can learn from the Acts of Pontius Pilate. And how it was predicted by
the Spirit of prophecy that He and those who hoped in Him should be
slain, hear what was said by Isaiah. These are the words: “Behold now
the righteous perisheth, and no man layeth it to heart; and just men are
taken away, and no man considereth. From the presence of wickedness is
the righteous man taken, and his burial shall be in peace: he is taken
from our midst.” <span id="fr_1867"></span>[1868](#fn_1867.md)
