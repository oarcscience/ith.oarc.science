### <span id="v.ii.xv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XV.—Exhortation to confess Christ by silence as well as speech.

<span id="v.ii.xv-p1"></span><span id="v.ii.xv-p1.1"></span><span
id="v.ii.xv-p1.2"></span>It is better for a man to be silent and be \[a
Christian\], than to talk and not to be one. It is good to teach, if he
who speaks also acts. There is then one Teacher, who spake and it was
done; while even those things which He did in silence are worthy of
<span id="page_56">p. 56</span> <span id="v.ii.xv-Page_56"></span> the
Father. He who possesses the word of Jesus, is truly able to hear even
His very silence, that he may be perfect, and may both act as he speaks,
and be recognised by his silence. There is nothing which is hid from
God, but our very secrets are near to Him. Let us therefore do all
things as those who have Him dwelling in us, that we may be His
temples, <span id="fr_589"></span>[590](#fn_589.md) and He may be in us as
our God, which indeed He is, and will manifest Himself before our faces.
Wherefore we justly love Him.

<span id="v.ii.xv-p3"></span><span id="v.ii.xv-p3.1"></span><span
id="v.ii.xv-p3.2"></span>It is better for a man to be silent and be \[a
Christian\], than to talk and not to be one. “The kingdom of God is not
in word, but in power.” <span id="fr_590"></span>[591](#fn_590.md) Men
“believe with the heart, and confess with the mouth,” the one “unto
righteousness,” the other “unto salvation.” <span
id="fr_591"></span>[592](#fn_591.md) It is good to teach, if he who speaks
also acts. For he who shall both “do and teach, the same shall be great
in the kingdom.” <span id="fr_592"></span>[593](#fn_592.md) Our Lord and
God, Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God, first did and then taught,
as Luke testifies, “whose praise is in the Gospel through all the
Churches.” <span id="fr_593"></span>[594](#fn_593.md) There is nothing
which is hid from the Lord, but our very secrets are near to Him. Let us
therefore do all things as those who have Him dwelling in us, that we
may be His temples, <span id="fr_594"></span>[595](#fn_594.md) and He may
be in us as God. Let Christ speak in us, even as He did in Paul. <span
id="v.ii.xv-p8.2"></span>Let the Holy Spirit teach us to speak the
things of Christ in like manner as He did.
