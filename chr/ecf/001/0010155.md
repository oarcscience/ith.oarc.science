### <span id="v.iii.ix-p0.1"></span>Chapter IX.—Let us live with Christ.

<span id="v.iii.ix-p1"></span><span id="v.iii.ix-p1.1"></span><span
id="v.iii.ix-p1.2"></span>If, therefore, those who were brought up in
the ancient order of things <span id="fr_679"></span>[680](#fn_679.md) have
come to the possession of a new <span id="fr_680"></span>[681](#fn_680.md)
hope, no longer observing the Sabbath, but living in the
observance <span id="fr_681"></span>[682](#fn_681.md) of the Lord’s Day, on
which also our life has sprung up again by Him and by His death—whom
some deny, by which mystery we have obtained faith, <span
id="fr_682"></span>[683](#fn_682.md) and therefore endure, that we may be
found the disciples of Jesus Christ, our only Master—how shall we be
able to live apart from Him, whose disciples the prophets themselves in
the Spirit did wait for Him as their Teacher? And therefore He whom they
rightly waited for, being come, raised them from the dead. <span
id="fr_683"></span>[684](#fn_683.md)

<span id="v.iii.ix-p7"></span>If, then, those who were conversant with
the ancient Scriptures came to newness of hope, expecting the coming of
Christ, as the Lord teaches us when He says, “If ye had believed Moses,
ye would have believed Me, for he wrote of Me;” <span
id="fr_684"></span>[685](#fn_684.md) and again, “Your father Abraham
rejoiced to see My day, and he saw it, and was glad; for before Abraham
was, I am;” <span id="fr_685"></span>[686](#fn_685.md) how shall we be able
to live without Him? The prophets were His servants, and foresaw Him by
the Spirit, and waited for Him as their Teacher, and expected Him as
their Lord and Saviour, saying, “He will come and save us.” <span
id="fr_686"></span>[687](#fn_686.md) <span id="v.iii.ix-p10.2"></span>Let
us therefore no longer keep the Sabbath after the Jewish manner, and
rejoice in days of idleness; for “he that does not work, let him not
eat.” <span id="fr_687"></span>[688](#fn_687.md) For say the \[holy\]
oracles, “In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat thy bread.” <span
id="fr_688"></span>[689](#fn_688.md) <span id="v.iii.ix-p12.2"></span>But
let every one of you keep the Sabbath after a spiritual manner,
rejoicing in meditation on the law, not in relaxation of the body,
admiring the workmanship of God, and not eating things prepared the day
before, nor using lukewarm drinks, and walking within a prescribed
space, nor finding delight in dancing and plaudits which have no sense
in them. <span id="fr_689"></span>[690](#fn_689.md) <span
id="v.iii.ix-p13.1"></span>And after the observance of the Sabbath, let
every friend of Christ keep the Lord’s Day as a festival, the
resurrection-day, the queen and chief of all the days \[of the week\].
Looking forward to this, the prophet declared, “To the end, for the
eighth day,” <span id="fr_690"></span>[691](#fn_690.md) on which our life
both sprang up again, and the victory over death was obtained in Christ,
whom the children of perdition, the enemies of the Saviour, deny, “whose
god is their belly, who mind earthly things,” <span
id="fr_691"></span>[692](#fn_691.md) who are “lovers of pleasure, and not
lovers of God, having a form of godliness, but denying the power
thereof.” <span id="fr_692"></span>[693](#fn_692.md) These make merchandise
of Christ, corrupting His word, and giving up Jesus to sale: they are
corrupters of women, and covetous of other men’s possessions, swallowing
up wealth <span id="fr_693"></span>[694](#fn_693.md) insatiably; from whom
may ye be delivered by the mercy of God through our Lord Jesus Christ!
