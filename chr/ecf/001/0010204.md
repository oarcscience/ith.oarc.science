### <span id="v.vii.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.—Their dangerous errors.

<span id="v.vii.v-p1"></span><span id="v.vii.v-p1.1"></span><span
id="v.vii.v-p1.2"></span><span id="v.vii.v-p1.3"></span>Some
ignorantly <span id="fr_1002"></span>[1003](#fn_1002.md) deny Him, or
rather have been denied by Him, being the advocates of death rather than
of the truth. These persons neither have the prophets persuaded, nor the
law of Moses, nor the Gospel even to this day, nor the sufferings we
have individually endured. For they think also the same thing regarding
us. <span id="fr_1003"></span>[1004](#fn_1003.md) For what does any one
profit me, if he commends me, but blasphemes my Lord, not confessing
that He was \[truly\] possessed of a body? <span
id="fr_1004"></span>[1005](#fn_1004.md) But he who does not acknowledge
this, has in fact altogether denied Him, being enveloped in death. <span
id="fr_1005"></span>[1006](#fn_1005.md) I have not, however, thought good
to write the names of such persons, inasmuch as they are unbelievers.
Yea, far be it from me to make any mention of them, until they repent
and return to \[a true belief in\] Christ’s passion, which is our
resurrection.

<span id="v.vii.v-p6"></span><span id="v.vii.v-p6.1"></span><span
id="v.vii.v-p6.2"></span><span id="v.vii.v-p6.3"></span>Some have

For what does it profit, if any one commends me, but blasphemes my Lord,
not owning Him to be God incarnate? <span

in fact altogether denied Him, being enveloped in death. I have not,
however, thought good to write the names of such persons, inasmuch as
