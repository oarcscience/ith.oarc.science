### <span id="viii.ii.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.—Charge of atheism refuted.

<span id="viii.ii.vi-p1"></span>Hence are we called atheists. <span
id="viii.ii.vi-p1.1"></span><span id="viii.ii.vi-p1.2"></span>And we
confess that we are atheists, so far as gods of this sort are concerned,
but not with respect to the most true God, the Father of righteousness
and temperance and the other virtues, who is free from all impurity.
<span id="viii.ii.vi-p1.3"></span><span
id="viii.ii.vi-p1.4"></span><span id="viii.ii.vi-p1.5"></span><span
id="viii.ii.vi-p1.6"></span>But both Him, and the Son (who came forth
from Him and taught us these things, and the host of the other good
angels who follow and are made like to Him), <span
id="fr_1775"></span>[1776](#fn_1775) and the prophetic Spirit, we
worship and adore, knowing them in reason and truth, and declaring
without grudging to every one who wishes to learn, as we have been
taught.

id="viii.ii.vi-p1.7"></span>

<span id="viii.ii.vi-p2"></span> This is the literal and obvious
translation of Justin’s words. But from <span class="upper"><span
id="viii.ii.vi-p2.1"></span>c</span>. 13, 16, and 61, it is evident that
he did not desire to inculcate the worship of angels. We are therefore
driven to adopt another translation of this passage, even though it be
somewhat harsh. Two such translations have been proposed: the first
connecting “us” and “the host of the other good angels” as the common
object of the verb “taught;” the second connecting “these things” with
“the host of,” etc., and making these two together the subject taught.
In the first case the translation would stand, “taught these things to
us and to the host,” etc.; in the second case the translation would be,
“taught us about these things, and about the host of the others who
follow Him, viz. the good angels.” \[I have ventured to insert
parenthetic marks in the text, an obvious and simple resource to suggest
the manifest intent of the author. Grabe’s note *in loc*. gives another
and very ingenious exegesis, but the simplest is best.\]
