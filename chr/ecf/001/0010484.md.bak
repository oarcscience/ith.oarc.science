### <span id="viii.iv.xxiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXIII.—The opinion of the Jews regarding the law does an injury to God.

<span id="viii.iv.xxiii-p1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.xxiii-p1.1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.xxiii-p1.2"></span><span id="viii.iv.xxiii-p1.3"></span>“But
if we do not admit this, we shall be liable to fall into foolish
opinions, as if it were not the same God who existed in the times of
Enoch and all the rest, who neither were circumcised after the flesh,
nor observed Sabbaths, nor any other rites, seeing that Moses enjoined
such observances; or that God has not wished each race of mankind
continually to perform the same righteous actions: to admit which, seems
to be ridiculous and absurd. Therefore we must confess that He, who is
ever the same, has commanded these and such like institutions on account
of sinful men, and we must declare Him to be benevolent, foreknowing,
needing nothing, righteous and good. But if this be not so, tell me,
sir, what you think of those matters which we are investigating.” And
when no one responded: “Wherefore, Trypho, I will proclaim to you, and
to those who wish to become proselytes, the divine message which I heard
from that man. <span id="fr_2004"></span>[2005](#fn_2004.md) Do you see
that the elements are not idle, and keep no Sabbaths? Remain as you were
born. For if there was no need of circumcision before Abraham, or of the
observance of Sabbaths, of feasts and sacrifices, before Moses; no more
need is there of them now, after that, according to the will of God,
Jesus Christ the Son of God has been born without sin, of a virgin
sprung from the stock of Abraham. For when Abraham himself was in
uncircumcision, he was justified and blessed by reason of the faith
which he reposed in God, as the Scripture tells. Moreover, the
Scriptures and the facts themselves compel us to admit that He received
circumcision for a sign, and not for righteousness. So that it was
justly recorded concerning the people, that the soul which shall not be
circumcised on the eighth day shall be cut off from his family. And,
furthermore, the inability of the female sex to receive fleshly
circumcision, proves that this circumcision has been given for a sign,
and not for a work of righteousness. For God has given likewise to women
the ability to observe all things which are righteous and virtuous; but
we see that the bodily form of the male has been made different from the
bodily form of the female; yet we know that neither of them is righteous
or unrighteous merely for this cause, but \[is considered righteous\] by
reason of piety and righteousness.
