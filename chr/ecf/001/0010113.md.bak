### <span id="iv.iv.xv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XV.—Polycarp is not injured by the fire.

<span id="iv.iv.xv-p1"></span><span id="iv.iv.xv-p1.1"></span>When he
had pronounced this *amen*, and so finished his prayer, those who were
appointed for the purpose kindled the fire. And as the flame blazed
forth in great fury, <span id="fr_459"></span>[460](#fn_459.md) we, to whom
it was given to witness it, beheld a great miracle, and have been
preserved that we might report to others what then took place. For the
fire, shaping itself into the form of an arch, like the sail of a ship
when filled with the wind, encompassed as by a circle the body of the
martyr. And he appeared within not like flesh which is burnt, but as
bread that is baked, or as gold and silver glowing in a furnace.
Moreover, we perceived such a sweet odour \[coming from the pile\], as
if frankincense or some such precious spices had been smoking <span
id="fr_460"></span>[461](#fn_460.md) there.
