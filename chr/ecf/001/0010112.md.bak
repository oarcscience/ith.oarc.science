### <span id="iv.iv.xiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIV.—The prayer of Polycarp.

<span id="iv.iv.xiv-p1"></span><span id="iv.iv.xiv-p1.1"></span>They did
not nail him then, but simply bound him. And he, placing his hands
behind him, and being bound like a distinguished ram \[taken\] out of a
great flock for sacrifice, and prepared to be an acceptable
burnt-offering unto God, looked up to heaven, and said, “O Lord God
Almighty, the Father of thy beloved and blessed Son Jesus Christ, by
whom we have received the knowledge of Thee, the God of angels and
powers, and of every creature, and of the whole race of the righteous
who live before thee, I give Thee thanks that Thou hast counted me,
worthy of this day and this hour, that I should have a part in the
number of Thy martyrs, in the cup <span
id="fr_455"></span>[456](#fn_455.md) of thy Christ, to the resurrection of
eternal life, both of soul and body, through the incorruption
\[imparted\] by the Holy Ghost. Among whom may I be accepted this day
before Thee as a fat <span id="fr_456"></span>[457](#fn_456.md) and
acceptable sacrifice, according as Thou, the ever-truthful <span
id="fr_457"></span>[458](#fn_457.md) God, hast foreordained, hast revealed
beforehand to me, and now hast fulfilled. Wherefore also I praise Thee
for all things, I bless Thee, I glorify Thee, along with the everlasting
and heavenly Jesus Christ, Thy beloved Son, with whom, to Thee, and the
Holy Ghost, be glory both now and to all coming ages. Amen.” <span

<span id="iv.iv.xiv-p4"></span> Literally, “the not false and true God.”

<span id="iv.iv.xiv-p5"></span> Eusebius (*Hist. Eccl.*, iv. 15) has
preserved a great portion of this Martyrium, but in a text considerably
differing from that we have followed. Here, instead of “and,” he has “in
the Holy Ghost.”
