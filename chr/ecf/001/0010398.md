race of men, used to worship Bacchus the son of Semele, and Apollo the
son of Latona (who in their loves with men did such things as it is
shameful even to mention), and Proserpine and Venus (who were maddened
with love of Adonis, and whose mysteries also you celebrate), or
Æsculapius, or some one or other of those who are called gods—have now,
through Jesus Christ, learned to despise these, though we be threatened
with death for it, and have dedicated ourselves to the unbegotten and
impossible God; of whom we are persuaded that never was he goaded by
lust of Antiope, or such other women, or of Ganymede, nor was rescued by
that hundred-handed giant whose aid was obtained through Thetis, nor was
anxious on this account <span id="fr_1816"></span>[1817](#fn_1816.md) that
her son Achilles should destroy many of the Greeks because of his
concubine Briseis. Those who believe these things we pity, and those who
invented them we know to be devils.
