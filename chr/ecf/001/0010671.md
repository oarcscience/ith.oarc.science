plotting of the devil against us, he declares: Before the advent of the
Lord, the devil did not so plainly know the measure of his own
punishment, inasmuch as the divine prophets had but enigmatically
announced it; as, for instance, Isaiah, who in the person of the
Assyrian tragically revealed the course to be followed against the
devil. But when the Lord appeared, and the devil clearly understood that
eternal fire was laid up and prepared for him and his angels, he then
began to plot without ceasing against the faithful, being desirous to
have many companions in his apostasy, that he might not by himself
endure the shame of condemnation, comforting himself by this cold and
malicious consolation.—*From the writings of* <span class="upper"><span
