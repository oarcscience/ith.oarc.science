### <span id="ix.iv.i-p0.1"></span>Preface.

<span id="ix.iv.i-p1"></span><span class="upper"><span
id="ix.iv.i-p1.1"></span>Thou</span> hast indeed enjoined upon me, my
very dear friend, that I should bring to light the Valentinian
doctrines, concealed, as their votaries imagine; that I should exhibit
their diversity, and compose a treatise in refutation of them. I
therefore have undertaken—showing that they spring from Simon, the
father of all heretics—to exhibit both their doctrines and successions,
and to set forth arguments against them all. Wherefore, since the
conviction of these men and their exposure is in many points but one
work, I have sent unto thee \[certain\] books, of which the first
comprises the opinions of all these men, and exhibits their customs, and
the character of their behaviour. In the second, again, their perverse
teachings are cast down and overthrown, and, such as they really are,
laid bare and open to view. But in this, the third book I shall adduce
proofs from the Scriptures, so that I may come behind in nothing of what
thou hast enjoined; yea, that over and above what thou didst reckon
upon, thou mayest receive from me the means of combating and vanquishing
those who, in whatever manner, are propagating falsehood. For the love
of God, being rich and ungrudging, confers upon the suppliant more than
he can ask from it. Call to mind then, the things which I have stated in
the two preceding books, and, taking these in connection with them, thou
shalt have from me a very copious refutation of all the heretics; and
faithfully and strenuously shalt thou resist them in defence of the only
true and life-giving faith, which the Church has received from the
apostles and imparted to her sons. For the Lord of all gave to His
apostles the power of the Gospel, through whom also we have known the
truth, that is, the doctrine of the Son of God; to whom also did the
Lord declare: “He that heareth you, heareth Me; and he that despiseth
you, despiseth Me, and Him that sent Me.” <span
