### <span id="viii.iv.xxviii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXVIII.—True righteousness is obtained by Christ.

<span id="viii.iv.xxviii-p1"></span>And Trypho replied, “We heard you
adducing this consideration a little ago, and we have given it
attention: for, to tell the truth, it is worthy of attention; and that
answer which pleases most —namely, that so it seemed good to Him—does
not satisfy me. For this is ever the shift to which those have recourse
who are unable to answer the question.”

<span id="viii.iv.xxviii-p2"></span><span
id="viii.iv.xxviii-p2.1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.xxviii-p2.2"></span><span
id="viii.iv.xxviii-p2.3"></span>Then I said, “Since I bring from the
Scriptures and the facts themselves both the proofs and the inculcation
of them, do not delay or hesitate to put faith in me, although I am an
uncircumcised man; so short a time is left you in which to become
proselytes. If Christ’s coming shall have anticipated you, in vain you
will repent, in vain you will weep; for He will not hear you. ‘Break up
your fallow ground,’ Jeremiah has cried to the people, ‘and sow not
among thorns. Circumcise yourselves to the Lord, and circumcise the
foreskin of your heart.’ <span id="fr_2018"></span>[2019](#fn_2018.md) Do
not sow, therefore, among thorns, and in untilled ground, whence you can
have no fruit. Know Christ; and behold the fallow ground, good, good and
fat, is in your hearts. ‘For, behold, the days come, saith the Lord,
that I will visit all them that are circumcised in their foreskins;
Egypt, and Judah, <span id="fr_2019"></span>[2020](#fn_2019.md) and Edom,
and the sons of Moab. For all the nations are uncircumcised, and all the
house of Israel are uncircumcised in their hearts.’ <span
id="fr_2020"></span>[2021](#fn_2020.md) Do you see how that God does not
mean this circumcision which is given for a sign? For it is of no use to
the Egyptians, or the sons of Moab, or the sons of Edom. But though a
man be a Scythian or a Persian, if he has the knowledge of God and of
His Christ, and keeps the everlasting righteous decrees, he is
circumcised with the good and useful circumcision, and is a friend of
God, and God rejoices in his gifts and offerings. But I will lay before
you, my friends, the very words of God, when He said to the people by
Malachi, one of the twelve prophets, ‘I have no pleasure in you, saith
the Lord; and I shall not accept your sacrifices at your hands: for from
the rising of the sun unto its setting My name shall be glorified among
the Gentiles; and in every place a sacrifice is offered unto My name,
even a pure sacrifice: for My name is honoured among the Gentiles, saith
the Lord; but ye profane it.’ <span id="fr_2021"></span>[2022](#fn_2021.md)
And by David He said, ‘A people whom I have not known, served Me; at the
hearing of the ear they obeyed Me.’ <span
id="fr_2022"></span>[2023](#fn_2022.md)
