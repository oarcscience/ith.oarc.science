### <span id="v.ii.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.—Exhortations to unity.

<span id="v.ii.iii-p1"></span><span id="v.ii.iii-p1.1"></span><span
id="v.ii.iii-p1.2"></span>I do not issue orders to you, as if I were
some great person. <span id="v.ii.iii-p1.3"></span>For though I am bound
for the name \[of Christ\], I am not yet perfect in Jesus Christ. For
now I begin to be a disciple, and I speak to you as fellow-disciples
with me. For it was needful for me to have been stirred up by you in
faith, exhortation, patience, and long-suffering. <span
id="v.ii.iii-p1.4"></span>But inasmuch as love suffers me not to be
silent in regard to you, I have therefore taken <span
id="fr_510"></span>[511](#fn_510.md) upon me first to exhort you that ye
would all run together in accordance with the will of God. For even
Jesus Christ, our inseparable life, is the \[manifested\] will of the
Father; as also bishops, settled everywhere to the utmost bounds \[of
the earth\], are so by the will of Jesus Christ.

<span id="v.ii.iii-p3"></span><span id="v.ii.iii-p3.1"></span><span
id="v.ii.iii-p3.2"></span>I do not issue orders to you, as if I were
some great person. <span id="v.ii.iii-p3.3"></span>For though I am bound
for His name, I am not yet perfect in Jesus Christ. For now I begin to
be a disciple, and I speak to you as my fellow-servants. For it was
needful for me to have been admonished by you in faith, exhortation,
patience, and long-suffering. <span id="v.ii.iii-p3.4"></span>But
inasmuch as love suffers me not to be silent in regard to you, I have
therefore taken <span id="fr_511"></span>[512](#fn_511.md) upon me first to
exhort you that ye would run together in accordance with the will of
God. For even Jesus Christ does all things according to the will of the
Father, as He Himself declares in a certain place, “I do always those
things that please Him.” <span id="fr_512"></span>[513](#fn_512.md) <span
id="v.ii.iii-p5.2"></span><span id="v.ii.iii-p5.3"></span>Wherefore it
behoves us also to live according to the will of God in Christ, and to
imitate Him as Paul did. For, says he, “Be ye followers of me, even as I
also am of Christ.” <span id="fr_513"></span>[514](#fn_513.md)
