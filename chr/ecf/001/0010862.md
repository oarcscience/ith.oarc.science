### <span id="ix.vii.xxv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXIV.—Of the constant falsehood of the devil, and of the powers and governments of the world, which we ought to obey, inasmuch as they are appointed of God, not of the devil.

<span id="ix.vii.xxv-p1"></span>1. <span id="ix.vii.xxv-p1.1"></span>As
therefore the devil lied at the beginning, so did he also in the end,
when he said, “All these are delivered unto me, and to whomsoever I will
I give them.” <span id="fr_4653"></span>[4654](#fn_4653.md) <span
id="ix.vii.xxv-p2.3"></span>For it is not he who has appointed the
kingdoms of this world, but God; for “the heart of the king is in the
hand of God.” <span id="fr_4654"></span>[4655](#fn_4654.md) And the Word
also says by Solomon, “By me kings do reign, and princes administer
justice. By me chiefs are raised up, and by me kings rule the
earth.” <span id="fr_4655"></span>[4656](#fn_4655.md) Paul the apostle also
says upon this same subject: “Be ye subject to all the higher powers;
for there is no power but of God: now those which are have been ordained
of God.” <span id="fr_4656"></span>[4657](#fn_4656.md) And again, in
reference to them he says, “For he beareth not the sword in vain; for he
is the minister of God, the avenger for wrath to him who does
evil.” <span id="fr_4657"></span>[4658](#fn_4657.md) Now, that he spake
these words, not in regard to angelical powers, nor of invisible rulers—
as some venture to expound the passage—but of those of actual human
authorities, \[he shows when\] he says, “For this cause pay ye tribute
also: for they are God’s ministers, doing service for this very
thing.” <span id="fr_4658"></span>[4659](#fn_4658.md) This also the Lord
confirmed, when He did not do what He was tempted to by the devil; but
He gave directions that tribute should be paid to the tax-gatherers for
Himself and Peter; <span id="fr_4659"></span>[4660](#fn_4659.md) because
“they are the ministers of God, serving for this very thing.”

<span id="ix.vii.xxv-p9"></span>2. For since man, by departing from God,
reached such a pitch of fury as even to look upon his brother as his
enemy, and engaged without fear in every kind of restless conduct, and
murder, and avarice; God imposed upon mankind the fear of man, as they
did not acknowledge the fear of God, in order that, being subjected to
the authority of men, and kept under restraint by their laws, they might
attain to some degree of justice, and exercise mutual forbearance
through dread of the sword suspended full in their view, as the apostle
says: “For he beareth not the sword in vain; for he is the minister of
God, the avenger for wrath upon him who does evil.” And for this reason
too, magistrates themselves, having laws as a clothing of righteousness
whenever they act in a just and legitimate manner, shall not be called
in question for their conduct, nor be liable to punishment. But
whatsoever they do to the subversion of justice, iniquitously, and
impiously, and illegally, and tyrannically, in these things shall they
also perish; for the just judgment of God comes equally upon all, and in
no case is defective. Earthly rule, therefore, has been appointed by God
for the benefit of nations, <span id="fr_4660"></span>[4661](#fn_4660.md)
and not by the devil, who is never at rest at all, nay, who does not
love to see even nations conducting themselves after a quiet manner, so
that under the fear of human rule, men may not eat each other up like
fishes; but that, by means of the establishment of laws, they may keep
down an excess of wickedness among the nations. And considered from this
point of view, those who exact tribute from us are “God’s ministers,
serving for this very purpose.”

<span id="ix.vii.xxv-p11"></span>3. As, then, “the powers that be are
ordained of God,” it is clear that the devil lied when he said, “These
are delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will, I give them.” For by
the law of the same Being as calls men into existence are kings also
appointed, adapted for those men who are at the time placed under their
government. Some of these \[rulers\] are given for the correction and
the benefit of their subjects, and for the preservation of justice; but
others, for the purposes of fear and punishment and rebuke: others, as
\[the subjects\] deserve it, are for deception, disgrace, and pride;
while the just judgment of God, as I have observed already, passes
equally upon all. The devil, however, as he is the apostate angel, can
only go to this length, as he did at the beginning, \[namely\] to
deceive and lead astray the mind of man into disobeying the commandments
of God, and gradually <span id="page_553">p. 553</span> <span
id="ix.vii.xxv-Page_553"></span> to darken the hearts of those who would
endeavour to serve him, to the forgetting of the true God, but to the
adoration of himself as God.

<span id="ix.vii.xxv-p12"></span>4. Just as if any one, being an
apostate, and seizing in a hostile manner another man’s territory,
should harass the inhabitants of it, in order that he might claim for
himself the glory of a king among those ignorant of his apostasy and
robbery; so likewise also the devil, being one among those angels who
are placed over the spirit of the air, as the Apostle Paul has declared
in his Epistle to the Ephesians, <span
id="fr_4661"></span>[4662](#fn_4661.md) becoming envious of man, was
rendered an apostate from the divine law: for envy is a thing foreign to
God. And as his apostasy was exposed by man, and man became the \[means
of\] searching out his thoughts (*et examinatio sententiæ ejus, homo
factus est*), he has set himself to this with greater and greater
determination, in opposition to man, envying his life, and wishing to
involve him in his own apostate power. The Word of God, however, the
Maker of all things, conquering him by means of human nature, and
showing him to be an apostate, has, on the contrary, put him under the
power of man. For He says, “Behold, I confer upon you the power of
treading upon serpents and scorpions, and upon all the power of the
enemy,” <span id="fr_4662"></span>[4663](#fn_4662.md) in order that, as he
obtained dominion over man by apostasy, so again his apostasy might be
deprived of power by means of man turning back again to God.
