### <span id="viii.iv.cxvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter CXVI.—It is shown how this prophecy suits the Christians.

<span id="viii.iv.cxvi-p1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.cxvi-p1.1"></span><span id="viii.iv.cxvi-p1.2"></span>“But
to give you the account of the revelation of the holy Jesus Christ, I
take up again my discourse, and I assert that even that revelation was
made for us who believe on Christ the High Priest, namely this crucified
One; and though we lived in fornication and all kinds of filthy
conversation, we have by the grace of our Jesus, according to His
Father’s will, stripped ourselves of all those filthy wickednesses with
which we were imbued. And though the devil is ever at hand to resist us,
and anxious to seduce all to himself, yet the Angel of God, i.e., the
Power of God sent to us through Jesus Christ, rebukes him, and he
departs from us. <span id="viii.iv.cxvi-p1.3"></span>And we are just as
if drawn out from the fire, when purified from our former sins, and
\[rescued\] from the affliction and the fiery trial by which the devil
and all his coadjutors try us; out of which Jesus the Son of God has
promised again to deliver us, <span id="fr_2385"></span>[2386](#fn_2385.md)
and invest us with prepared garments, if we do His commandments; and has
undertaken to provide an eternal kingdom \[for us\]. <span
id="viii.iv.cxvi-p2.4"></span><span id="viii.iv.cxvi-p2.5"></span>For
just as that Jesus (Joshua), called by the prophet a priest, evidently
had on filthy garments because he is said to have taken a harlot for a
wife, <span id="fr_2386"></span>[2387](#fn_2386.md) and is called a brand
plucked out of the fire, because he had received remission of sins when
the devil that resisted him was rebuked; even so we, who through the
name of Jesus have believed as one man in God the Maker of all, have
been stripped, through the name of His first-begotten Son, of the filthy
garments, i.e., of our sins; and being vehemently inflamed by the word
of His calling, we are the true high priestly race of God, as even God
Himself bears witness, saying that in every place among the Gentiles
sacrifices are presented to Him well-pleasing and pure. Now God receives
sacrifices from no one, except through His priests. <span

“out of which Jesus the Son of God again snatches us. He promised that

<span id="viii.iv.cxvi-p3"></span> Justin either confuses Joshua son of
Josedech with Hosea the prophet, or he refers to the Jewish tradition
that “filthy garments” signified either an illicit marriage, or sins of
the people, or the squalor of captivity.
