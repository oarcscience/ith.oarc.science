### <span id="viii.vi.xxiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXIII.—Plato’s self-contradiction.

<span id="viii.vi.xxiii-p1"></span><span
id="viii.vi.xxiii-p1.1"></span><span id="viii.vi.xxiii-p1.2"></span>But,
perhaps, some who are unwilling to abandon the doctrines of polytheism,
will say that to these fashioned gods the maker said, “Since ye have
been produced, ye are not immortal, nor at all, imperishable; yet shall
ye not perish nor succumb to the fatality of death, because you have
obtained my will, <span id="fr_2554"></span>[2555](#fn_2554) which is a
still greater and mightier bond.” Here Plato, through fear of the
adherents of polytheism, introduces his “maker” uttering words which
contradict himself. For having formerly stated that he said that
everything which is produced is perishable, he now introduces him saying
the very opposite; and he does not see that it is thus absolutely
impossible for him to escape the charge of falsehood. For he either at
first uttered what is false when he said that everything which is
produced is perishable, or now, when he propounds the very opposite to
what he had formerly said. For if, according to his former definition,
it is absolutely necessary that every created thing be perishable, how
can he consistently make that possible which is absolutely impossible?
So that Plato seems to grant an empty and impossible prerogative to his
“maker,” when he propounds that those who were once perishable because
made from matter should again, by his intervention, become imperishable
and enduring. For it is quite natural that the power of matter, which,
according to Plato’s opinion, is uncreated, and contemporary and coæval
with the maker, should resist his will. For he who has not created has
no power, in respect of that which is uncreated, so that it is not
possible that it (matter), being free, can be controlled by any external
necessity. Wherefore Plato himself, in consideration of this, has
written thus: “It is necessary to affirm that God cannot suffer
violence.”
