### <span id="iv.iv.xii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XII.—Polycarp is sentenced to be burned.

<span id="iv.iv.xii-p1"></span>While he spoke these and many other like
things, he was filled with confidence and joy, and his countenance was
full of grace, so that not merely did it not fall as if troubled by the
things said to him, but, on the contrary, the proconsul was astonished,
and sent his herald to proclaim in the midst of the stadium thrice,
“Polycarp has confessed that he is a Christian.” This proclamation
having been made by the herald, the whole multitude both of the heathen
and Jews, who dwelt at Smyrna, cried out with uncontrollable fury, and
in a loud voice, “This is the teacher of Asia, <span
id="fr_450"></span>[451](#fn_450) the father of the Christians, and the
overthrower of our gods, he who has been teaching many not to sacrifice,
or to worship the gods.” Speaking thus, they cried out, and besought
Philip the Asiarch <span id="fr_451"></span>[452](#fn_451) to let loose
a lion upon Polycarp. But Philip answered that it was not lawful for him
to do so, seeing the shows <span id="fr_452"></span>[453](#fn_452) of
wild beasts were already finished. Then it seemed good to them to cry
out with one consent, that Polycarp should be burnt alive. For thus it
behooved the vision which was revealed to him in regard to his pillow to
be fulfilled, when, seeing it on fire as he was praying, he turned about
and said prophetically to the faithful that were with him, “I must be
burnt alive.”
