### <span id="v.ii.i-p0.1"></span>Chapter I.—Praise of the Ephesians.

<span id="v.ii.i-p1"></span><span id="v.ii.i-p1.1"></span><span
class="upper"><span id="v.ii.i-p1.2"></span>I have</span> become
acquainted with your name, much-beloved in God, which ye have acquired
by the habit of righteousness, according to the faith and love in Jesus
Christ our Saviour. Being the followers <span
id="fr_489"></span>[490](#fn_489) of God, and stirring up <span
id="fr_490"></span>[491](#fn_490) yourselves by the blood of God, ye
have perfectly accomplished the work which was beseeming to you. <span
id="v.ii.i-p3.2"></span>For, on hearing that I came bound from Syria for
the common name and hope, trusting through your prayers to be permitted
to fight with beasts at Rome, that so by martyrdom I may indeed become
the disciple of Him “who gave Himself for us, an offering and sacrifice
to God,” <span id="fr_491"></span>[492](#fn_491) \[ye hastened to see
me <span id="fr_492"></span>[493](#fn_492) \]. <span
id="v.ii.i-p5.1"></span>I received, therefore, <span
id="fr_493"></span>[494](#fn_493) your whole multitude in the name of
God, through Onesimus, a man of inexpressible love, <span
id="fr_494"></span>[495](#fn_494) and your bishop in the flesh, whom I
pray you by Jesus Christ to love, and that you would all seek to be like
him. And blessed be He who has granted unto you, being worthy, to obtain
such an excellent bishop.

<span id="v.ii.i-p8"></span><span id="v.ii.i-p8.1"></span><span
class="upper"><span id="v.ii.i-p8.2"></span>I have</span> become
acquainted with your greatly-desired name in God, which ye have acquired
by the habit of righteousness, according to the faith and love in Christ
Jesus our Saviour. Being the followers <span
id="fr_495"></span>[496](#fn_495) of the love of God towards man, and
stirring up <span id="fr_496"></span>[497](#fn_496) yourselves by the
blood of Christ, you have perfectly accomplished the work which was
beseeming to you. <span id="v.ii.i-p10.2"></span>For, on hearing that I
came bound from Syria for the sake of Christ, our common hope, trusting
through your prayers to be permitted to fight with beasts at Rome, that
so by martyrdom I may indeed become the disciple of Him “who gave
Himself for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God,” <span
id="fr_497"></span>[498](#fn_497) \[ye hastened to see me <span
id="fr_498"></span>[499](#fn_498) \]. <span id="v.ii.i-p12.1"></span>I
have therefore received your whole multitude in the name of God, through
Onesimus, a man of inexpressible love, <span
id="fr_499"></span>[500](#fn_499) and who is your bishop, whom I pray
you by Jesus Christ to love, and that you would all seek to be like him.
Blessed be God, who has granted unto you, who are yourselves so
excellent, to obtain such an excellent bishop.
