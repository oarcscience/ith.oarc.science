<span id="ix.viii.xlix-p1"></span>Now <span
id="fr_4898"></span>[4899](#fn_4898.md) therefore, by means of this which
has been already brought forth a long time since, the Word has assigned
an interpretation. We are convinced that there exist \[so to speak\] two
men in each one of us. The one is confessedly a hidden thing, while the
other stands apparent; one is corporeal, the other spiritual; although
the generation of both may be compared to that of twins. For both are
revealed to the world as but one, for the soul was not anterior to the
body in its essence; nor, in regard to its formation, did the body
precede the soul: but both these were produced at one time; and their
nourishment consists in purity and sweetness.
