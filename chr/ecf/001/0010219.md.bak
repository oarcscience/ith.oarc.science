### <span id="v.viii.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.—The duties of the Christian flock.

<span id="v.viii.vi-p1"></span><span id="v.viii.vi-p1.1"></span><span
id="v.viii.vi-p1.2"></span><span id="v.viii.vi-p1.3"></span>Give
ye <span id="fr_1098"></span>[1099](#fn_1098.md) heed to the bishop, that
God also may give heed to you. <span id="v.viii.vi-p2.1"></span>My soul
be for theirs <span id="fr_1099"></span>[1100](#fn_1099.md) that are
submissive to the bishop, to the presbyters, and to the deacons, and may
my portion be along with them in God! <span
id="v.viii.vi-p3.1"></span><span id="v.viii.vi-p3.2"></span>Labour
together with one another; strive in company together; run together;
suffer together; sleep together; and awake together, as the stewards,
and associates, <span id="fr_1100"></span>[1101](#fn_1100.md) and servants
of God. Please ye Him under whom ye fight, and from whom ye receive your
wages. Let none of you be found a deserter. Let your baptism endure as
your arms; your faith as your helmet; your love as your spear; your
patience as a complete panoply. Let your works be the charge <span
id="fr_1101"></span>[1102](#fn_1101.md) assigned to you, that ye may
receive a worthy recompense. Be long-suffering, therefore, with one
another, in meekness, as God is towards you. May I have joy of you for
ever! <span id="fr_1102"></span>[1103](#fn_1102.md)

<span id="v.viii.vi-p7"></span><span id="v.viii.vi-p7.1"></span><span
id="v.viii.vi-p7.2"></span><span id="v.viii.vi-p7.3"></span>Give
ye <span id="fr_1103"></span>[1104](#fn_1103.md) heed to the bishop, that
God also may give heed to you. <span id="v.viii.vi-p8.1"></span>My soul
be for theirs <span id="fr_1104"></span>[1105](#fn_1104.md) that are
submissive to the bishop, to the presbytery, and to the deacons: may I
have my portion with them from God! <span
id="v.viii.vi-p9.1"></span><span id="v.viii.vi-p9.2"></span>Labour
together with one another; strive in company together; run together;
suffer together; sleep together; and awake together, as the stewards,
and associates, <span id="fr_1105"></span>[1106](#fn_1105.md) and servants
of God. Please ye Him under whom ye fight, and from whom ye shall
receive your wages. Let none of you be found a deserter. Let your
baptism endure as your arms; your faith as your helmet; your love as
your spear; your patience as a complete panoply. Let your works be the
charge assigned to you, that you may obtain for them a most worthy <span
id="fr_1106"></span>[1107](#fn_1106.md) recompense. Be long-suffering,
therefore, with one another, in meekness, and God shall be so with you.
May I have joy of you for ever! <span
