### <span id="v.vi.vii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VII.—I have exhorted you to unity.

<span id="v.vi.vii-p1"></span>For though some would have deceived me
according to the flesh, yet the Spirit, as being from God, is not
deceived. For it knows both whence it comes and whither it goes, <span
id="fr_938"></span>[939](#fn_938) and detects the secrets \[of the
heart\]. For, when I was among you, I cried, I spoke with a loud voice:
Give heed to the bishop, and to the presbytery and deacons. Now, some
suspected me of having spoken thus, as knowing beforehand the division
caused by some among you. <span id="fr_939"></span>[940](#fn_939) But He
is my witness, for whose sake I am in bonds, that I got no intelligence
from any man. <span id="fr_940"></span>[941](#fn_940) But the Spirit
proclaimed <span id="page_84">p. 84</span> <span
id="v.vi.vii-Page_84"></span> these words: Do nothing without the
bishop; keep your bodies <span id="fr_941"></span>[942](#fn_941) as the
temples of God; <span id="fr_942"></span>[943](#fn_942) love unity;
avoid divisions; be the followers of Jesus Christ, even as He is of His
Father.

<span id="v.vi.vii-p7"></span>For though some would have deceived me
according to the flesh, yet my spirit is not deceived; for I have
received it from God. For it knows both whence it comes and whither it
goes, and detects the secrets \[of the heart\]. For when I was among
you, I cried, I spoke with a loud voice—the word is not mine, but
God’s—Give heed to the bishop, and to the presbytery and deacons. But if
ye suspect that I spake thus, as having learned beforehand the division
caused by some among you, He is my witness, for whose sake I am in
bonds, that I learned nothing of it from the mouth of any man. But the
Spirit made an announcement to me, saying as follows: Do nothing without
the bishop; keep your bodies <span id="fr_943"></span>[944](#fn_943) as
the temples of God; love unity; avoid divisions; be ye followers of
Paul, and of the rest of the apostles, even as they also were of Christ.
