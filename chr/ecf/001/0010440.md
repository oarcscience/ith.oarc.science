### <span id="viii.ii.lxvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter LXVII.—Weekly worship of the Christians.

<span id="viii.ii.lxvii-p1"></span><span
id="viii.ii.lxvii-p1.1"></span><span
id="viii.ii.lxvii-p1.2"></span><span id="viii.ii.lxvii-p1.3"></span>And
we afterwards continually remind each other of these things. And the
wealthy among us help the needy; and we always keep together; and for
all things wherewith we are supplied, we bless the Maker of all through
His Son <span id="page_186">p. 186</span> <span
id="viii.ii.lxvii-Page_186"></span> Jesus Christ, and through the Holy
Ghost. <span id="viii.ii.lxvii-p1.4"></span>And on the day called
Sunday, <span id="fr_1912"></span>[1913](#fn_1912) all who live in
cities or in the country gather together to one place, and the memoirs
of the apostles or the writings of the prophets are read, as long as
time permits; then, when the reader has ceased, the president verbally
instructs, and exhorts to the imitation of these good things. <span
id="viii.ii.lxvii-p2.2"></span><span id="viii.ii.lxvii-p2.3"></span>Then
we all rise together and pray, and, as we before said, when our prayer
is ended, bread and wine and water are brought, and the president in
like manner offers prayers and thanksgivings, according to his
ability, <span id="fr_1913"></span>[1914](#fn_1913) and the people
assent, saying Amen; and there is a distribution to each, and a
participation of that over which thanks have been given, <span
id="fr_1914"></span>[1915](#fn_1914) and to those who are absent a
portion is sent by the deacons. And they who are well to do, and
willing, give what each thinks fit; and what is collected is deposited
with the president, who succours the orphans and widows and those who,
through sickness or any other cause, are in want, and those who are in
bonds and the strangers sojourning among us, and in a word takes care of
all who are in need. But Sunday is the day on which we all hold our
common assembly, because it is the first day on which God, having
wrought a change in the darkness and matter, made the world; and Jesus
Christ our Saviour on the same day rose from the dead. For He was
crucified on the day before that of Saturn (Saturday); and on the day
after that of Saturn, which is the day of the Sun, having appeared to
His apostles and disciples, He taught them these things, which we have
submitted to you also for your consideration.

<span id="viii.ii.lxvii-p3"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.ii.lxvii-p3.1"></span>ὅση δύναμις αὐτῷ,</span>—a phrase over
which there has been much contention, but which seems to admit of no
other meaning than that given above. \[No need of any “contention.”
Langus renders, *Pro virili suâ*, and Grabe illustrates by reference to
*Apost. Const.*, lib. viii. cap. 12. Our own learned translators render
the same phrase (cap. xiii., above) “to the utmost of our power.” Some
say this favours extemporary prayers, and others object. Oh! what matter
either way? We all sing hymns, “according to our ability.”\]
