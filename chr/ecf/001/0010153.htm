<p><a name="v.iii.vii-p1"></A><a name="v.iii.vii-p1.1"></A><a name="v.iii.vii-p1.2"></A>As therefore the Lord did nothing without the Father, being united to Him, neither by Himself nor by the apostles, so neither do ye anything without the bishop and presbyters. <a name="v.iii.vii-p1.3"></A><a name="v.iii.vii-p1.4"></A>Neither endeavour that anything appear reasonable and proper to yourselves apart; but being come together into the same place, let there be one prayer, one supplication, one mind, one hope, in love and in joy undefiled. There is one Jesus Christ, than whom nothing is more excellent. Do ye therefore all run together as into one temple of God, as to one altar, as to one Jesus Christ, who came forth from one Father, and is with and has gone to one.</p>  
<p><a name="v.iii.vii-p2"></A><a name="v.iii.vii-p2.1"></A><a name="v.iii.vii-p2.2"></A>As therefore the Lord does nothing without the Father, for says He, &#8220;I can of mine own self do nothing,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_673"></A><A HREF="#fn_673"><FONT SIZE="1">674</FONT></A>
 so do ye, neither presbyter, nor deacon, nor layman, do anything without the bishop. Nor let anything appear commendable to you which is destitute of his approval.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_674"></A><A HREF="#fn_674"><FONT SIZE="1">675</FONT></A>
 For every such thing is sinful, and opposed [to the will of] God. <a name="v.iii.vii-p4.1"></A><a name="v.iii.vii-p4.2"></A>Do ye all come together into the same place for prayer. Let there be one common supplication, one mind, one hope, with faith unblameable in Christ Jesus, than which nothing is more excellent. Do ye all, as one man, run together into the temple of God, as unto one altar, to one Jesus Christ, the High Priest of the unbegotten God.</p>
