### <span id="ix.vi.xxxvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXV.—A refutation of those who allege that the prophets uttered some predictions under the inspiration of the highest, others from the Demiurge. Disagreements of the Valentinians among themselves with regard to these same predictions.

<span id="ix.vi.xxxvi-p1"></span>1. <span
id="ix.vi.xxxvi-p1.1"></span><span id="ix.vi.xxxvi-p1.2"></span>Then
again, in opposition to the Valentinians, and the other Gnostics,
falsely so called, who maintain that some parts of Scripture were spoken
at one time from the Pleroma (*a summitate*) through means of the seed
\[derived\] from that place, but at another time from the intermediate
abode through means of the audacious mother Prunica, but that many are
due to the Creator of the world, from whom also the prophets had their
mission, we say that it is altogether irrational to bring down the
Father of the universe to such straits, as that He should not be
possessed of His own proper instruments, by which the things in the
Pleroma might be perfectly proclaimed. For of whom was He afraid, so
that He should not reveal His will after His own way and independently,
freely, and without being involved with that spirit which came into
being in a state of degeneracy and ignorance? Was it that He feared that
very many would be saved, when more should have listened to the
unadulterated truth? Or, on the other hand, was He incapable of
preparing for Himself those who should announce the Saviour’s advent?

<span id="ix.vi.xxxvi-p2"></span>2. But if, when the Saviour came to
this earth, He sent His apostles into the world to proclaim with
accuracy His advent, and to teach the Father’s will, having nothing in
common with the doctrine of the Gentiles or of the Jews, much more,
while yet existing in the Pleroma, would He have appointed His own
heralds to proclaim His future advent into this world, and having
nothing in common with those prophecies originating from the Demiurge.
But if, when within the Pleroma, He availed Himself of those prophets
who were under the law, and declared His own matters through their
instrumentality; much more would He, upon His arrival hither, have made
use of these same teachers, and have preached the Gospel to us by their
means. Therefore let them not any longer assert that Peter and Paul and
the other apostles proclaimed the truth, but that it was the scribes and
Pharisees, and the others, through whom the law was propounded. But if,
at His advent, He sent forth His own apostles in the spirit of truth,
and not in that of error, He did the very same also in the case of the
prophets; for the Word of God was always the self-same: and if the
Spirit from the Pleroma was, according to these men’s system, the Spirit
of light, the Spirit of truth, the Spirit of perfection, and the Spirit
of knowledge, while that from the Demiurge was the spirit of ignorance,
degeneracy, and error, and the offspring of obscurity; how can it be,
that in one and the same being there exists perfection and defect,
knowledge and ignorance, error and truth, light and darkness? But if it
was impossible that such should happen in the case of the prophets, for
they preached the word of the Lord from one God, and proclaimed the
advent of His Son, much more would the Lord Himself never have uttered
words, on one occasion from above, but on another from degeneracy below,
thus becoming the teacher at once of knowledge and of ignorance; nor
would He have ever glorified as Father at one time the Founder of the
world, and at another Him who is above this one, as He does Himself
declare: “No man putteth a piece of a new garment upon an old one, nor
do they put new wine into old bottles.” <span
id="fr_4351"></span>[4352](#fn_4351.md) Let these men, therefore, either
have nothing whatever to do with the prophets, as with those that are
ancients, and allege no longer that these men, being sent beforehand by
the Demiurge, spake certain things under that new influence which
pertains to the Pleroma; or, on the other hand, let them be convinced by
our Lord, when He declares that new wine cannot be put into old bottles.

<span id="ix.vi.xxxvi-p4"></span>3. But from what source could the
offspring of their mother derive his knowledge of the mysteries within
the Pleroma, and power to discourse regarding them? Suppose that the
mother, while beyond the Pleroma, did bring forth this very offspring;
but what is beyond the Pleroma they represent as being beyond the pale
of knowledge, that is, ignorance. How, then, could that seed, which was
conceived in ignorance, possess the power of declaring knowledge? Or how
did the mother herself, a shapeless and undefined being, one cast out of
doors as an abortion, obtain knowledge of the mysteries within the
Pleroma, she who was organized outside it and given a form there, and
prohibited by Horos from entering within, and who remains outside the
Pleroma till the consummation \[of all things\], that is, beyond the
pale of knowledge? Then, again, when they say that the Lord’s passion is
a type of the extension of the Christ above, which he effected through
Horos, and so imparted a form to their mother, they are refuted in the
other particulars \[of the Lord’s passion\], for they have no semblance
of a type to show with regard <span id="page_514">p. 514</span> <span
id="ix.vi.xxxvi-Page_514"></span> to them. For when did the Christ above
have vinegar and gall given him to drink? Or when was his raiment
parted? Or when was he pierced, and blood and water came forth? Or when
did he sweat great drops of blood? And \[the same may be demanded\] as
to the other particulars which happened to the Lord, of which the
prophets have spoken. From whence, then, did the mother or her offspring
divine the things which had not yet taken place, but which should occur
afterwards?

<span id="ix.vi.xxxvi-p5"></span>4. They affirm that certain things
still, besides these, were spoken from the Pleroma, but are confuted by
those which are referred to in the Scriptures as bearing on the advent
of Christ. But what these are \[that are spoken from the Pleroma\] they
are not agreed, but give different answers regarding them. For if any
one, wishing to test them, do question one by one with regard to any
passage those who are their leading men, he shall find one of them
referring the passage in question to the Propator—that is, to Bythus;
another attributing it to Arche—that is, to the Only-begotten; another
to the Father of all—that is, to the Word; while another, again, will
say that it was spoken of that one Æon who was \[formed from the joint
contributions\] of the Æons in the Pleroma; <span
id="fr_4352"></span>[4353](#fn_4352.md) others \[will regard the passage\]
as referring to Christ, while another \[will refer it\] to the Saviour.
One, again, more skilled than these, <span
id="fr_4353"></span>[4354](#fn_4353.md) after a long protracted silence,
declares that it was spoken of Horos; another that it signifies the
Sophia which is within the Pleroma; another that it announces the mother
outside the Pleroma; while another will mention the God who made the
world (the Demiurge). Such are the variations existing among them with
regard to one \[passage\], holding discordant opinions as to the same
Scriptures; and when the same identical passage is read out, they all
begin to purse up their eyebrows, and to shake their heads, and they say
that they might indeed utter a discourse transcendently lofty, but that
all cannot comprehend the greatness of that thought which is implied in
it; and that, therefore, among the wise the chief thing is silence. For
that Sige (*silence*) which is above must be typified by that silence
which they preserve. Thus do they, as many as they are, all depart
\[from each other\], holding so many opinions as to one thing, and
bearing about their clever notions in secret within themselves. When,
therefore, they shall have agreed among themselves as to the things
predicted in the Scriptures, then also shall they be confuted by us.
For, though holding wrong opinions, they do in the meanwhile, however,
convict themselves, since they are not of one mind with regard to the
same words. But as we follow for our teacher the one and only true God,
and possess His words as the rule of truth, we do all speak alike with
regard to the same things, knowing but one God, the Creator of this
universe, who sent the prophets, who led forth the people from the land
of Egypt, who in these last times manifested His own Son, that He might
put the unbelievers to confusion, and search out the fruit of
righteousness.
