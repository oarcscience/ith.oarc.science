### <span id="v.vi.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.—Do not accept Judaism.

<span id="v.vi.vi-p1"></span><span id="v.vi.vi-p1.1"></span><span
id="v.vi.vi-p1.2"></span><span id="v.vi.vi-p1.3"></span><span
id="v.vi.vi-p1.4"></span><span id="v.vi.vi-p1.5"></span>But if any one
preach the Jewish law <span id="fr_922"></span>[923](#fn_922) unto you,
listen not to him. For it is better to hearken to Christian doctrine
from a man who has been circumcised, than to Judaism from one
uncircumcised. But if either of such persons do not speak concerning
Jesus Christ, they are in my judgment but as monuments and sepulchres of
the dead, upon which are written only the names of men. <span
id="v.vi.vi-p2.1"></span>Flee therefore the wicked devices and snares of
the prince <span id="page_83">p. 83</span> <span
id="v.vi.vi-Page_83"></span> of this world, lest at any time being
conquered <span id="fr_923"></span>[924](#fn_923) by his
artifices, <span id="fr_924"></span>[925](#fn_924) ye grow weak in your
love. But be ye all joined together <span
id="fr_925"></span>[926](#fn_925) with an undivided heart. And I thank
my God that I have a good conscience in respect to you, and that no one
has it in his power to boast, either privately or publicly, that I have
burdened <span id="fr_926"></span>[927](#fn_926) any one either in much
or in little. And I wish for all among whom I have spoken, that they may
not possess that for a testimony against them.

<span id="v.vi.vi-p7"></span><span id="v.vi.vi-p7.1"></span><span
id="v.vi.vi-p7.2"></span><span id="v.vi.vi-p7.3"></span>If any one
preaches the one God of the law and the prophets, but denies Christ to
be the Son of God, he is a liar, even as also is his father the
devil, <span id="fr_927"></span>[928](#fn_927) and is a Jew falsely so
called, being possessed of <span id="fr_928"></span>[929](#fn_928) mere
carnal circumcision. <span id="v.vi.vi-p9.1"></span><span
id="v.vi.vi-p9.2"></span><span id="v.vi.vi-p9.3"></span>If any one
confesses Christ Jesus the Lord, but denies the God of the law and of
the prophets, saying that the Father of Christ is not the Maker of
heaven and earth, he has not continued in the truth any more than his
father the devil, <span id="fr_929"></span>[930](#fn_929) and is a
disciple of Simon Magus, not of the Holy Spirit. If any one says there
is one God, and also confesses Christ Jesus, but thinks the Lord to be a
mere man, and not the only-begotten <span
id="fr_930"></span>[931](#fn_930) God, and Wisdom, and the Word of God,
and deems Him to consist merely of a soul and body, such an one is a
serpent, that preaches deceit and error for the destruction of men.
<span id="v.vi.vi-p11.2"></span>And such a man is poor in understanding,
even as by name he is an Ebionite. <span
id="fr_931"></span>[932](#fn_931) If any one confesses the truths
mentioned, <span id="fr_932"></span>[933](#fn_932) but calls lawful
wedlock, and the procreation of children, destruction and pollution, or
deems certain kinds of food abominable, such an one has the apostate
dragon dwelling within him. <span id="v.vi.vi-p13.1"></span><span
id="v.vi.vi-p13.2"></span>If any one confesses the Father, and the Son,
and the Holy Ghost, and praises the creation, but calls the incarnation
merely an appearance, and is ashamed of the passion, such an one has
denied the faith, not less than the Jews who killed Christ. <span
id="v.vi.vi-p13.3"></span><span id="v.vi.vi-p13.4"></span>If any one
confesses these things, and that God the Word did dwell in a human body,
being within it as the Word, even as the soul also is in the body,
because it was God that inhabited it, and not a human soul, but affirms
that unlawful unions are a good thing, and places the highest
happiness <span id="fr_933"></span>[934](#fn_933) in pleasure, as does
the man who is falsely called a Nicolaitan, this person can neither be a
lover of God, nor a lover of Christ, but is a corrupter of his own
flesh, and therefore void of the Holy Spirit, and a stranger to Christ.
All such persons are but monuments and sepulchres of the dead, upon
which are written only the names of dead men. <span
id="v.vi.vi-p14.1"></span>Flee, therefore, the wicked devices and snares
of the spirit which now worketh in the children of this world, <span
id="fr_934"></span>[935](#fn_934) lest at any time being overcome, <span
id="fr_935"></span>[936](#fn_935) ye grow weak in your love. But be ye
all joined together <span id="fr_936"></span>[937](#fn_936) with an
undivided heart and a willing mind, “being of one accord and of one
judgment,” <span id="fr_937"></span>[938](#fn_937) being always of the
same opinion about the same things, both when you are at ease and in
danger, both in sorrow and in joy. I thank God, through Jesus Christ,
that I have a good conscience in respect to you, and that no one has it
in his power to boast, either privately or publicly, that I have
burdened any one either in much or in little. And I wish for all among
whom I have spoken, that they may not possess that for a testimony
against them.
