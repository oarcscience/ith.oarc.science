### <span id="viii.iv.lxix-p0.1"></span>Chapter LXIX.—The devil, since he emulates the truth, has invented fables about Bacchus, Hercules, and Æsculapius.

<span id="viii.iv.lxix-p1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.lxix-p1.1"></span><span id="viii.iv.lxix-p1.2"></span><span
id="viii.iv.lxix-p1.3"></span>“Be well assured, then, Trypho,” I
continued, “that I am established in the knowledge of and faith in the
Scriptures by those counterfeits which he who is called the devil is
said to have performed among the Greeks; just as some were wrought by
the Magi in Egypt, and others by the false prophets in Elijah’s days.
For when they tell that Bacchus, son of Jupiter, was begotten by
\[Jupiter’s\] intercourse with Semele, and that he was the discoverer of
the vine; and when they relate, that being torn in pieces, and having
died, he rose again, and ascended to heaven; and when they introduce
wine <span id="fr_2206"></span>[2207](#fn_2206.md) into his mysteries, do I
not perceive that \[the devil\] has imitated the prophecy announced by
the patriarch Jacob, and recorded by Moses? And when they tell that
Hercules was strong, and travelled over all the world, and was begotten
by Jove of Alcmene, and ascended to heaven when he died, do I not
perceive that the Scripture which speaks of Christ, ‘strong as a giant
to run his race,’ <span id="fr_2207"></span>[2208](#fn_2207.md) has been in
like manner imitated? And when he \[the devil\] brings forward
Æsculapius as the raiser of the dead and healer of all diseases, may I
not say that in this matter likewise he has imitated the prophecies
about Christ? But since I have not quoted to you such Scripture as tells
that Christ will do these things, I must necessarily remind you of one
such: from which you can understand, how that to those destitute of a
knowledge of God, I mean the Gentiles, who, ‘having eyes, saw not, and
having a heart, understood not,’ worshipping the images of wood, \[how
even to them\] Scripture prophesied that they would renounce these
\[vanities\], and hope in this Christ. It is thus written: ‘Rejoice,
thirsty wilderness: let the wilderness be glad, and blossom as the lily:
the deserts of the Jordan shall both blossom and be glad: and the glory
of Lebanon was given to it, and the honour of Carmel. And my people
shall see the exaltation of the Lord, and the glory of God. Be strong,
ye careless hands and enfeebled knees. Be comforted, ye faint in soul:
be strong, fear not. Behold, our God gives, and will give, retributive
judgment. He shall come and save us. Then the eyes of the blind shall be
opened, and the ears of the deaf shall hear. Then the lame shall leap as
an hart, and the tongue of the stammerers shall be distinct: for water
has broken forth in the wilderness, and a valley in the thirsty land;
and the parched ground shall become pools, and a spring of water shall
\[rise up\] in the thirsty land.’ <span
id="fr_2208"></span>[2209](#fn_2208.md) The spring of living water which
gushed forth from God in the land destitute of the knowledge of God,
namely the land of the Gentiles, was this Christ, who also appeared in
your nation, and healed those who were maimed, and deaf, and lame in
body from their birth, causing them to leap, to hear, and to see, by His
word. And having raised the dead, and causing them to live, by His deeds
He compelled the men who lived at that time to recognise Him. But though
they saw such works, they asserted it was magical art. For they dared to
call Him a magician, and a deceiver of the people. Yet He wrought such
works, and persuaded those who were \[destined to\] believe on Him; for
even if any one be labouring under a defect of body, yet be an observer
of the doctrines delivered by Him, He shall raise him up at His second
advent perfectly sound, after He has made him immortal, and
incorruptible, and free from grief.
