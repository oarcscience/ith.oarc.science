### <span id="v.v.i-p0.1"></span>Chapter I.—As a prisoner, I hope to see you.

<span id="v.v.i-p1"></span><span id="v.v.i-p1.1"></span><span
class="upper"><span id="v.v.i-p1.2"></span>Through</span> prayer <span
id="fr_821"></span>[822](#fn_821.md) to God I have obtained the privilege
of seeing your most worthy faces, <span
id="fr_822"></span>[823](#fn_822.md) and have even <span
id="fr_823"></span>[824](#fn_823.md) been granted more than I requested;
for I hope as a prisoner in Christ Jesus to salute you, if indeed it be
the will of God that I be thought worthy of attaining unto the end. For
the beginning has been well ordered, <span id="page_74">p. 74</span>
<span id="v.v.i-Page_74"></span> if I may obtain grace to cling to <span
id="fr_824"></span>[825](#fn_824.md) my lot without hindrance unto the end.
For I am afraid of your love, <span id="fr_825"></span>[826](#fn_825.md)
lest it should do me an injury. For it is easy for you to accomplish
what you please; but it is difficult for me to attain to God, if ye
spare me.

<span id="v.v.i-p7"></span><span id="v.v.i-p7.1"></span><span
class="upper"><span id="v.v.i-p7.2"></span>Through</span> prayer to God
I have obtained the privilege of seeing your most worthy faces, <span
id="fr_826"></span>[827](#fn_826.md) even as I earnestly begged might be
granted me; for as a prisoner in Christ Jesus I hope to salute you, if
indeed it be the will \[of God\] that I be thought worthy of attaining
unto the end. For the beginning has been well ordered, if I may obtain
grace to cling to <span id="fr_827"></span>[828](#fn_827.md) my lot without
hindrance unto the end. For I am afraid of your love, <span
id="fr_828"></span>[829](#fn_828.md) lest it should do me an injury. For it
is easy for you to accomplish what you please; but it is difficult for
me to attain to God, if ye do not spare me, <span
id="fr_829"></span>[830](#fn_829.md) under the pretence of carnal
affection.
