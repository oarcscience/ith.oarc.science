### <span id="ii.ii.xlvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XLVII.—Your recent discord is worse than the former which took place in the times of Paul.

<span id="ii.ii.xlvii-p1"></span><span
id="ii.ii.xlvii-p1.1"></span><span id="ii.ii.xlvii-p1.2"></span><span
id="ii.ii.xlvii-p1.3"></span>Take up the epistle of the blessed Apostle
Paul. What did he write to you at the time when the Gospel first began
to be preached? <span id="fr_211"></span>[212](#fn_211) Truly, under the
inspiration <span id="fr_212"></span>[213](#fn_212) of the Spirit, he
wrote to you concerning himself, and Cephas, and Apollos, <span
id="fr_213"></span>[214](#fn_213) because even then parties <span
id="fr_214"></span>[215](#fn_214) had been formed among you. But that
inclination for one above another entailed less guilt upon you, inasmuch
as your partialities were then shown towards apostles, already of high
reputation, and towards a man whom they had approved. But now reflect
who those are that have perverted you, and lessened the renown of your
far-famed brotherly love. <span id="ii.ii.xlvii-p5.1"></span>It is
disgraceful, beloved, yea, highly disgraceful, and unworthy of your
Christian profession, <span id="fr_215"></span>[216](#fn_215) that such
a thing should be heard of as that the most stedfast and ancient Church
of the Corinthians should, on account of one or two persons, engage in
sedition against its presbyters. And this rumour has reached not only
us, but those also who are unconnected <span
id="fr_216"></span>[217](#fn_216) with us; so that, through your
infatuation, the name of the Lord is blasphemed, while danger is also
brought upon yourselves.
