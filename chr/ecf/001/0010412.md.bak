### <span id="viii.ii.xxxix-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXIX.—Direct predictions by the Spirit.

<span id="viii.ii.xxxix-p1"></span>And when the Spirit of prophecy
speaks as predicting things that are to come to pass, He speaks in this
way: “For out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord
from Jerusalem. And He shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke
many people; and they shall beat their swords into ploughshares, and
their spears into pruning-hooks: nation shall not lift up sword against
nation, neither shall they learn war any more.” <span
id="fr_1848"></span>[1849](#fn_1848.md) And that it did so come to pass, we
can convince you. <span id="viii.ii.xxxix-p2.2"></span>For from
Jerusalem there went out into the world, men, twelve in number, and
these illiterate, of no ability in speaking: but by the power of God
they proclaimed to every race of men that they were sent <span
id="page_176">p. 176</span> <span id="viii.ii.xxxix-Page_176"></span> by
Christ to teach to all the word of God; and we who formerly used to
murder one another do not only now refrain from making war upon our
enemies, but also, that we may not lie nor deceive our examiners,
willingly die confessing Christ. For that saying, “The tongue has sworn
but the mind is unsworn,” <span id="fr_1849"></span>[1850](#fn_1849.md)
might be imitated by us in this matter. But if the soldiers enrolled by
you, and who have taken the military oath, prefer their allegiance to
their own life, and parents, and country, and all kindred, though you
can offer them nothing incorruptible, it were verily ridiculous if we,
who earnestly long for incorruption, should not endure all things, in
order to obtain what we desire from Him who is able to grant it.
