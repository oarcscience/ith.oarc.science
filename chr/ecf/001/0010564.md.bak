<span id="viii.iv.ciii"></span>

### <span id="viii.iv.ciii-p0.1"></span>Chapter CIII.—The Pharisees are the bulls: the roaring lion is Herod or the devil.

<span id="viii.iv.ciii-p1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.ciii-p1.1"></span><span id="viii.iv.ciii-p1.2"></span>“Then
what is next said in the Psalm—‘For trouble is near, for there is none
to help me. Many calves have compassed me; fat bulls have beset me
round. They opened their mouth upon me as a ravening and roaring lion.
All my bones are poured out and dispersed like water,’—was likewise a
prediction of the events which happened to Him. For on that night when
some of your nation, who had been sent by the Pharisees and Scribes, and
teachers, <span id="fr_2340"></span>[2341](#fn_2340.md) came upon Him from
the Mount <span id="fr_2341"></span>[2342](#fn_2341.md) of Olives, those
whom Scripture called butting and prematurely destructive calves
surrounded Him. And the expression, ‘Fat bulls have beset me round,’ He
spoke beforehand of those who acted similarly to the calves, when He was
led before your teachers. And the Scripture described them as bulls,
since we know that bulls are authors of calves’ existence. As therefore
the bulls are the begetters of the calves, so your teachers were the
cause why their children went out to the Mount of Olives to take Him and
bring Him to them. And the expression, ‘For there is none to help,’ is
also indicative of what took place. For there was not even a single man
to assist Him as an innocent person. And the expression, ‘They opened
their mouth upon me like a roaring lion,’ <span id="page_251">p.
251</span> <span id="viii.iv.ciii-Page_251"></span> designates him who
was then king of the Jews, and was called Herod, a successor of the
Herod who, when Christ was born, slew all the infants in Bethlehem born
about the same time, because he imagined that amongst them He would
assuredly be of whom the Magi from Arabia had spoken; for he was
ignorant of the will of Him that is stronger than all, how He had
commanded Joseph and Mary to take the Child and depart into Egypt, and
there to remain until a revelation should again be made to them to
return into their own country. And there they did remain until Herod,
who slew the infants in Bethlehem, was dead, and Archelaus had succeeded
him. And he died before Christ came to the dispensation on the cross
which was given Him by His Father. And when Herod succeeded Archelaus,
having received the authority which had been allotted to him, Pilate
sent to him by way of compliment Jesus bound; and God foreknowing that
this would happen, had thus spoken: ‘And they brought Him to the
Assyrian, a present to the king.’ <span
id="fr_2342"></span>[2343](#fn_2342.md) <span
id="viii.iv.ciii-p4.2"></span>Or He meant the devil by the lion roaring
against Him: whom Moses calls the serpent, but in Job and Zechariah he
is called the devil, and by Jesus is addressed as Satan, showing that a
compounded name was acquired by him from the deeds which he performed.
For ‘Sata’ in the Jewish and Syrian tongue means apostate; and ‘Nas’ is
the word from which he is called by interpretation the *serpent*, i.e.,
according to the interpretation of the Hebrew term, from both of which
there arises the single word *Satanas*. For this devil, when \[Jesus\]
went up from the river Jordan, at the time when the voice spake to Him,
‘Thou art my Son: this day have I begotten Thee,’ <span
id="fr_2343"></span>[2344](#fn_2343.md) is recorded in the memoirs of the
apostles to have come to Him and tempted Him, even so far as to say to
Him, ‘Worship me;’ and Christ answered him, ‘Get thee behind me, Satan:
thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou
serve.’ <span id="fr_2344"></span>[2345](#fn_2344.md) For as he had
deceived Adam, so he hoped <span id="fr_2345"></span>[2346](#fn_2345.md)
that he might contrive some mischief against Christ also. Moreover, the
statement, ‘All my bones are poured out <span
id="fr_2346"></span>[2347](#fn_2346.md) and dispersed like water; my heart
has become like wax, melting in the midst of my belly,’ was a prediction
of that which happened to Him on that night when men came out against
Him to the Mount of Olives to seize Him. For in the memoirs which I say
were drawn up by His apostles and those who followed them, \[it is
recorded\] that His sweat fell down like drops of blood while He was
praying, and saying, ‘If it be possible, let this cup pass:’ <span
id="fr_2347"></span>[2348](#fn_2347.md) His heart and also His bones
trembling; His heart being like wax melting in His belly: <span
id="fr_2348"></span>[2349](#fn_2348.md) in order that we may perceive that
the Father wished His Son really <span
id="fr_2349"></span>[2350](#fn_2349.md) to undergo such sufferings for our
sakes, and may not say that He, being the Son of God, did not feel what
was happening to Him and inflicted on Him. Further, the expression, ‘My
strength is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue has cleaved to my
throat,’ was a prediction, as I previously remarked, of that silence,
when He who convicted all your teachers of being unwise returned no
answer at all.
