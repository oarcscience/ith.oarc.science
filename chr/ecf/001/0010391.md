### <span id="viii.ii.xviii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.—Proof of immortality and the resurrection.

<span id="viii.ii.xviii-p1"></span>For reflect upon the end of each of
the preceding kings, how they died the death common to all, which, if it
issued in insensibility, would <span id="page_169">p. 169</span> <span
id="viii.ii.xviii-Page_169"></span> be a godsend <span
id="fr_1802"></span>[1803](#fn_1802.md) to all the wicked. <span
id="viii.ii.xviii-p2.2"></span>But since sensation remains to all who
have ever lived, and eternal punishment is laid up (i.e., for the
wicked), see that ye neglect not to be convinced, and to hold as your
belief, that these things are true. <span
id="viii.ii.xviii-p2.3"></span><span
id="viii.ii.xviii-p2.4"></span><span
id="viii.ii.xviii-p2.5"></span><span id="viii.ii.xviii-p2.6"></span>For
let even necromancy, and the divinations you practise by immaculate
children, <span id="fr_1803"></span>[1804](#fn_1803.md) and the evoking of
departed human souls, <span id="fr_1804"></span>[1805](#fn_1804.md) and
those who are called among the magi, Dream-senders and Assistant-spirits
(Familiars), <span id="fr_1805"></span>[1806](#fn_1805.md) and all that is
done by those who are skilled in such matters —let these persuade you
that even after death souls are in a state of sensation; and those who
are seized and cast about by the spirits of the dead, whom all call
dæmoniacs or madmen; <span id="fr_1806"></span>[1807](#fn_1806.md) and what
you repute as oracles, both of Amphilochus, Dodana, Pytho, and as many
other such as exist; and the opinions of your authors, Empedocles and
Pythagoras, Plato and Socrates, and the pit of Homer, <span
id="fr_1807"></span>[1808](#fn_1807.md) and the descent of Ulysses to
inspect these things, and all that has been uttered of a like kind. Such
favour as you grant to these, grant also to us, who not less but more
firmly than they believe in God; since we expect to receive again our
own bodies, though they be dead and cast into the earth, for we maintain
that with God nothing is impossible.

<span id="fn_1802"></span>[169:1803](0010391.htm#fr_1802.md) <span

<span id="viii.ii.xviii-p2"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.ii.xviii-p2.1"></span>ἓρμαιον</span>, a piece of unlooked-for
luck, Hermes being the reputed giver of such gifts: *vid.* Liddell and
Scott’s *Lex.*; see also the Scholiast, quoted by Stallbaum in Plato’s
*Phæd.*, p. 107, on a passage singularly analogous to this.

<span id="fn_1803"></span>[169:1804](0010391.htm#fr_1803.md) <span
id="viii.ii.xviii-p2.7"></span>

<span id="viii.ii.xviii-p3"></span> Boys and girls, or even children
prematurely taken from the womb, were slaughtered, and their entrails
inspected, in the belief that the souls of the victims (being still
conscious, as Justin is arguing) would reveal things hidden and future.
Instances are abundantly cited by Otto and Trollope.

<span id="fn_1804"></span>[169:1805](0010391.htm#fr_1804.md) <span
id="viii.ii.xviii-p3.1"></span>

<span id="viii.ii.xviii-p4"></span> This form of spirit-rapping was
familiar to the ancients, and Justin again (*Dial. c. Tryph.*, c. 105)
uses the invocation of Samuel by the witch of Endor as a proof of the
immortality of the soul.

<span id="fn_1805"></span>[169:1806](0010391.htm#fr_1805.md) <span
id="viii.ii.xviii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="viii.ii.xviii-p5"></span> Valesius (on Euseb. *H. E.*, iv. 7)
states that the magi had two kinds of familiars: the first, who were
sent to inspire men with dreams which might give them intimations of
things future; and the second, who were sent to watch over men, and
protect them from diseases and misfortunes. The first, he says, they
called (as here) <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.ii.xviii-p5.1"></span>ὀνειροπομπούς</span>, and the second
<span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.ii.xviii-p5.2"></span>παρέδρους</span>.

<span id="fn_1806"></span>[169:1807](0010391.htm#fr_1806.md) <span
id="viii.ii.xviii-p5.3"></span>

<span id="viii.ii.xviii-p6"></span> Justin is not the only author in
ancient or recent times who has classed dæmoniacs and maniacs together;
neither does he stand alone among the ancients in the opinion that
dæmoniacs were possessed by the spirits of departed men. References will
be found in Trollope’s note. \[See this matter more fully illustrated in
Kaye’s *Justin Martyr*, pp. 105–111.\]

<span id="fn_1807"></span>[169:1808](0010391.htm#fr_1807.md) <span
id="viii.ii.xviii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="viii.ii.xviii-p7"></span> See the *Odyssey*, book xi. line 25,
where Ulysses is described as digging a pit or trench with his sword,
and pouring libations, in order to collect around him the souls of the
dead.
