### <span id="v.iii.xi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XI.—I write these things to warn you.

<span id="v.iii.xi-p1"></span><span id="v.iii.xi-p1.1"></span>These
things \[I address to you\], my beloved, not that I know any of you to
be in such a state; <span id="fr_705"></span>[706](#fn_705.md) but, as less
than any of you, I desire to guard you beforehand, that ye fall not upon
the hooks of vain doctrine, but that <span id="page_64">p. 64</span>
<span id="v.iii.xi-Page_64"></span> ye attain to full assurance in
regard to the birth, and passion, and resurrection which took place in
the time of the government of Pontius Pilate, being truly and certainly
accomplished by Jesus Christ, who is our hope, <span
id="fr_706"></span>[707](#fn_706.md) from which may no one of you ever be
turned aside.

<span id="v.iii.xi-p4"></span><span id="v.iii.xi-p4.1"></span>These
things \[I address to you\], my beloved, not that I know any of you to
be in such a state; <span id="fr_707"></span>[708](#fn_707.md) but, as less
than any of you, I desire to guard you beforehand, that ye fall not upon
the hooks of vain doctrine, but that you may rather attain to a full
assurance in Christ, who was begotten by the Father before all ages, but
was afterwards born of the Virgin Mary without any intercourse with man.
<span id="v.iii.xi-p5.1"></span>He also lived a holy life, and healed
every kind of sickness and disease among the people, and wrought signs
and wonders for the benefit of men; and to those who had fallen into the
error of polytheism He made known the one and only true God, His Father,
and underwent the passion, and endured the cross at the hands of the
Christ-killing Jews, under Pontius Pilate the governor and Herod the
king. <span id="v.iii.xi-p5.2"></span><span id="v.iii.xi-p5.3"></span>He
also died, and rose again, and ascended into the heavens to Him that
sent Him, and is sat down at His right hand, and shall come at the end
of the world, with His Father’s glory, to judge the living and the dead,
and to render to every one according to his works. <span
id="fr_708"></span>[709](#fn_708.md) He who knows these things with a full
assurance, and believes them, is happy; even as ye are now the lovers of
God and of Christ, in the full assurance of our hope, from which may no
one of us <span id="fr_709"></span>[710](#fn_709.md) ever be turned aside!
