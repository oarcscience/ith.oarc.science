### <span id="v.iii.x-p0.1"></span>Chapter X.—Beware of Judaizing.

<span id="v.iii.x-p1"></span><span id="v.iii.x-p1.1"></span><span
id="v.iii.x-p1.2"></span>Let us not, therefore, be insensible to His
kindness. <span id="v.iii.x-p1.3"></span><span
id="v.iii.x-p1.4"></span>For were He to reward us according to our
works, we should cease to be. Therefore, having become His disciples,
let us learn to live according to the principles of Christianity. <span
id="fr_694"></span>[695](#fn_694.md) For whosoever is called by any other
name besides this, is not of God. <span id="v.iii.x-p2.1"></span>Lay
aside, therefore, the evil, the old, the sour leaven, and be ye changed
into the new leaven, which is Jesus Christ. Be ye salted in Him, lest
any one among you should be corrupted, since by your savour ye shall be
convicted. <span id="v.iii.x-p2.2"></span>It is absurd to profess <span
id="fr_695"></span>[696](#fn_695.md) Christ Jesus, and to Judaize. For
Christianity did not embrace <span id="fr_696"></span>[697](#fn_696.md)
Judaism, but Judaism Christianity, that so every tongue which believeth
might be gathered together to God.

<span id="v.iii.x-p5"></span><span id="v.iii.x-p5.1"></span><span
id="v.iii.x-p5.2"></span>Let us not, therefore, be insensible to His
kindness. <span id="v.iii.x-p5.3"></span><span
id="v.iii.x-p5.4"></span>For were He to reward us according to our
works, we should cease to be. For “if Thou, Lord, shalt mark iniquities,
O Lord, who shall stand?” <span id="fr_697"></span>[698](#fn_697.md) Let us
therefore prove ourselves worthy of that name which we have received.
For whosoever is called by any other name besides this, he is not of
God; for he has not received the prophecy which speaks thus concerning
us: “The people shall be called by a new name, which the Lord shall name
them, and shall be a holy people.” <span
id="fr_698"></span>[699](#fn_698.md) This was first fulfilled in Syria; for
“the disciples were called Christians at Antioch,” <span
id="fr_699"></span>[700](#fn_699.md) when Paul and Peter were laying the
foundations of the Church. <span id="v.iii.x-p8.2"></span>Lay aside,
therefore, the evil, the old, the corrupt leaven, <span
id="fr_700"></span>[701](#fn_700.md) and be ye changed into the new leaven
of grace. Abide in Christ, that the stranger <span
id="fr_701"></span>[702](#fn_701.md) may not have dominion over you. <span
id="v.iii.x-p10.1"></span>It is absurd to speak of Jesus Christ with the
tongue, and to cherish in the mind a Judaism which has now come to an
end. For where there is Christianity there cannot be Judaism. For Christ
is one, in whom every nation that believes, and every tongue that
confesses, is gathered unto God. And those that were of a stony heart
have become the children of Abraham, the friend of God; <span
id="fr_702"></span>[703](#fn_702.md) and in his seed all those have been
blessed <span id="fr_703"></span>[704](#fn_703.md) who were ordained to
eternal life <span id="fr_704"></span>[705](#fn_704.md) in Christ.
