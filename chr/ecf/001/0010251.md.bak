## <span id="v.xiii-p0.1"></span>Introductory Note to the Spurious Epistles of Ignatius

<span id="v.xiii-p1"></span><span id="v.xiii-p1.1"></span><span
class="upper"><span id="v.xiii-p1.2"></span>To</span> the following
introductory note of the translators nothing need be prefixed, except a
grateful acknowledgment of the value of their labours and of their good
judgment in giving us even these spurious writings for purposes of
comparison. They have thus placed the materials for a complete
understanding of the whole subject, before students who have a mind to
subject it to a thorough and candid examination.

<span id="v.xiii-p2"></span>The following is the original <span
class="upper"><span id="v.xiii-p2.1"></span>Introductory Notice</span>:—

<span id="v.xiii-p3"></span><span class="upper"><span
id="v.xiii-p3.1"></span>We</span> formerly stated that eight out of the
fifteen Epistles bearing the name of Ignatius are now universally
admitted to be spurious. None of them are quoted or referred to by any
ancient writer previous to the sixth century. The style, moreover, in
which they are written, so different from that of the other Ignatian
letters, and allusions which they contain to heresies and ecclesiastical
arrangements of a much later date than that of their professed author,
render it perfectly certain that they are not the authentic production
of the illustrious bishop of Antioch.

<span id="v.xiii-p4"></span>We cannot tell when or by whom these
Epistles were fabricated. They have been thought to betray the same hand
as the longer and interpolated form of the seven Epistles which are
generally regarded as genuine. And some have conceived that the writer
who gave forth to the world the Apostolic Constitutions under the name
of Clement, was probably the author of these letters falsely ascribed to
Ignatius, as well as of the longer recension of the seven Epistles which
are mentioned by Eusebius.

<span id="v.xiii-p5"></span>It was a considerable time before editors in
modern times began to discriminate between the true and the false in the
writings attributed to Ignatius. The letters first published under his
name were those three which exist only in Latin. These came forth in
1495 at Paris, being appended to a life of Becket, Archbishop of
Canterbury. Some three years later, eleven Epistles, comprising those
mentioned by Eusebius, and four others, were published in Latin, and
passed through four or five editions. In 1536, the whole of the
professedly Ignatian letters were published at Cologne in a Latin
version; and this collection also passed through several editions. It
was not till 1557 that the Ignatian Epistles appeared for the first time
in Greek at Dillingen. After this date many editions came forth, in
which the probably genuine were still mixed up with the certainly
spurious, the three Latin letters, only being rejected as destitute of
authority. Vedelius of Geneva first made the distinction which is now
universally accepted, in an edition of these Epistles which he published
in 1623; and he was followed by Archbishop Usher and others, who entered
more fully into that critical examination of these writings which has
been continued down even to our own day.

<span id="v.xiii-p6"></span>The reader will have no difficulty in
detecting the internal grounds on which these eight letters <span
id="page_106">p. 106</span> <span id="v.xiii-Page_106"></span> are set
aside as spurious. The difference of style from the other Ignatian
writings will strike him even in perusing the English version which we
have given, while it is of course much more marked in the original. And
other decisive proofs present themselves in every one of the Epistles.
In that to the Tarsians there is found a plain allusion to the Sabellian
heresy, which did not arise till after the middle of the third century.
In the Epistle to the Antiochians there is an enumeration of various
Church officers, who were certainly unknown at the period when Ignatius
lived. The Epistle to Hero plainly alludes to Manichæan errors, and
could not therefore have been written before the third century. There
are equally decisive proofs of spuriousness to be found in the Epistle
to the Philippians, such as the references it contains to the
Patripassian heresy originated by Praxeas in the latter part of the
second century, and the ecclesiastical feasts, etc., of which it makes
mention. The letter to Maria Cassobolita is of a very peculiar style,
utterly alien from that of the other Epistles ascribed to Ignatius. And
it is sufficient simply to glance at the short Epistles to St. John and
the Virgin Mary, in order to see that they carry the stamp of imposture
on their front; and, indeed, no sooner were they published than by
almost universal consent they were rejected.

<span id="v.xiii-p7"></span>But though the additional Ignatian letters
here given are confessedly spurious, we have thought it not improper to
present them to the English reader in an appendix to our first
volume. <span id="fr_1175"></span>[1176](#fn_1175.md) We have done so,
because they have been so closely connected with the name of the bishop
of Antioch, and also because they are in themselves not destitute of
interest. We have, moreover, the satisfaction of thus placing for the
first time within the reach of one acquainted only with our language,
all the materials that have entered into the protracted agitation of the
famous Ignatian controversy.

<span id="v.xiii-p8"></span> \[Spurious writings, if they can be traced
to antiquity, are always useful. Sometimes they are evidence of facts,
always of opinions, ideas and fancies of their date; and often they
enable us to identify the origin of corruptions. Even interpolations
prove what later partisans would be glad to find, if they could, in
early writers. They bear unwilling testimony to the absence of *genuine*
evidence in favour of their assumptions.\]
