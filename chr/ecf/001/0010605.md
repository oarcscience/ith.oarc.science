### <span id="viii.v.i-p0.1"></span>Chapter I.—Justin justifies his departure from Greek customs.

<span id="viii.v.i-p1"></span><span id="viii.v.i-p1.1"></span><span
id="viii.v.i-p1.2"></span><span id="viii.v.i-p1.3"></span><span
class="upper"><span id="viii.v.i-p1.4"></span>Do</span> not suppose, ye
Greeks, that my separation from your customs is unreasonable and
unthinking; for I found in them nothing that is holy or acceptable to
God. For the very compositions of your poets are monuments of madness
and intemperance. For any one who becomes the scholar of your most
eminent instructor, is more beset by difficulties than all men besides.
For first they say that Agamemnon, abetting the extravagant lust of his
brother, and his madness and unrestrained desire, readily gave even his
daughter to be sacrificed, and troubled all Greece that he might rescue
Helen, who had been ravished by the leprous <span
id="fr_2492"></span>[2493](#fn_2492.md) shepherd. But when in the course of
the war they took captives, Agamemnon was himself taken captive by
Chryseis, and for Briseis’ sake kindled a feud with the son of Thetis.
And Pelides himself, who crossed the river, <span
id="fr_2493"></span>[2494](#fn_2493.md) overthrew Troy, and subdued Hector,
this your hero became the slave of Polyxena, and was conquered by a dead
Amazon; and putting off the god-fabricated armour, and donning the
hymeneal robe, he became a sacrifice of love in the temple of Apollo.
And the Ithacan Ulysses made a virtue of a vice. <span
id="fr_2494"></span>[2495](#fn_2494.md) And indeed his sailing past the
Sirens <span id="fr_2495"></span>[2496](#fn_2495.md) gave evidence that he
was destitute of worthy prudence, because he could not depend on his
prudence for stopping his ears. Ajax, son of Telamon, who bore the
shield of sevenfold ox-hide, went mad when he was defeated in the
contest with Ulysses for the armour. Such things I have no desire to be
instructed in. Of such virtue I am not covetous, that I should believe
the myths of Homer. For the whole rhapsody, the beginning and end both
of the Iliad and the Odyssey is—a woman.

<span id="viii.v.i-p2"></span> Potter would here read <span
class="Greek"><span id="viii.v.i-p2.1"></span>λιπαροῦ</span>, “elegant”
\[ironically for effeminate\]; but the above reading is defended by
Sylburg, on the ground that shepherds were so greatly despised, that
this is not too hard an epithet to apply to Paris.

<span id="viii.v.i-p3"></span> Of the many attempts to amend this
clause, there seems to be none satisfactory.

<span id="viii.v.i-p4"></span> Or, won the reputation of the virtue of
wisdom by the vice of deceit.

<span id="viii.v.i-p5"></span> That is, the manner in which he did it,
stopping his companions’ ears with wax, and having himself bound to the
mast of his ship.
