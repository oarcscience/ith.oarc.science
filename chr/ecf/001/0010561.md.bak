### <span id="viii.iv.c-p0.1"></span>Chapter C.—In what sense Christ is \[called\] Jacob, and Israel, and Son of Man.

<span id="viii.iv.c-p1"></span><span id="viii.iv.c-p1.1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.c-p1.2"></span><span id="viii.iv.c-p1.3"></span><span
id="viii.iv.c-p1.4"></span>“Then what follows —‘But Thou, the praise of
Israel, inhabitest the holy place’—declared that He is to do something
worthy of praise and wonderment, being about to rise again from the dead
on the third day after the crucifixion; and this He has obtained from
the Father. For I <span id="page_249">p. 249</span> <span
id="viii.iv.c-Page_249"></span> have showed already that Christ is
called both Jacob and Israel; and I have proved that it is not in the
blessing of Joseph and Judah alone that what relates to Him was
proclaimed mysteriously, but also in the Gospel it is written that He
said: ‘All things are delivered unto me by My Father;’ and, ‘No man
knoweth the Father but the Son; nor the Son but the Father, and they to
whom the Son will reveal Him.’ <span
id="fr_2327"></span>[2328](#fn_2327.md) Accordingly He revealed to us all
that we have perceived by His grace out of the Scriptures, so that we
know Him to be the first-begotten of God, and to be before all
creatures; likewise to be the Son of the patriarchs, since He assumed
flesh by the Virgin of their family, and submitted to become a man
without comeliness, dishonoured, and subject to suffering. Hence, also,
among His words He said, when He was discoursing about His future
sufferings: ‘The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected by
the Pharisees and Scribes, and be crucified, and on the third day rise
again.’ <span id="fr_2328"></span>[2329](#fn_2328.md) He said then that He
was the Son of man, either because of His birth by the Virgin, who was,
as I said, of the family of David <span
id="fr_2329"></span>[2330](#fn_2329.md) and Jacob, and Isaac, and Abraham;
or because Adam <span id="fr_2330"></span>[2331](#fn_2330.md) was the
father both of Himself and of those who have been first enumerated from
whom Mary derives her descent. For we know that the fathers of women are
the fathers likewise of those children whom their daughters bear. For
\[Christ\] called one of His disciples— previously known by the name of
Simon—Peter; since he recognised Him to be Christ the Son of God, by the
revelation of His Father: and since we find it recorded in the memoirs
of His apostles that He is the Son of God, and since we call Him the
Son, we have understood that He proceeded before all creatures from the
Father by His power and will (for He is addressed in the writings of the
prophets in one way or another as Wisdom, and the Day, <span
id="fr_2331"></span>[2332](#fn_2331.md) and the East, and a Sword, and a
Stone, and a Rod, and Jacob, and Israel); and that He became man by the
Virgin, in order that the disobedience which proceeded from the serpent
might receive its destruction in the same manner in which it derived its
origin. For Eve, who was a virgin and undefiled, having conceived the
word of the serpent, brought forth disobedience and death. But the
Virgin Mary received faith and joy, when the angel Gabriel announced the
good tidings to her that the Spirit of the Lord would come upon her, and
the power of the Highest would overshadow her: wherefore also the Holy
Thing begotten of her is the Son of God; <span
id="fr_2332"></span>[2333](#fn_2332.md) and she replied, ‘Be it unto me
according to thy word.’ ” <span id="fr_2333"></span>[2334](#fn_2333.md) And
by her has He been born, to whom we have proved so many Scriptures
refer, and by whom God destroys both the serpent and those angels and
men who are like him; but works deliverance from death to those who
repent of their wickedness and believe upon Him.

<span id="viii.iv.c-p6"></span> It is not easy, says Maranus, to say in
what Scripture Christ is so called. \[Clearly he refers to the Dayspring
(St. [Luke i. 78](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#078.md)<span
id="viii.iv.c-p6.1"></span>) as the LXX. render many texts of the O.T.
See [Zech. iii. 8](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#008.md)<span
id="viii.iv.c-p6.2"></span>.\] Perhaps Justin had in his mind the
passage, “This the *day* which the Lord hath made” ([Ps. cxviii.
24](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#024)<span id="viii.iv.c-p6.3"></span>.md).
Clem. Alex. teaches that Christ is here referred to.
