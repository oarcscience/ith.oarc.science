<span id="v.viii.viii"></span>

### <span id="v.viii.viii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VIII.—Let other churches also send to Antioch.

<span id="v.viii.viii-p1"></span>Inasmuch as I have not been able to
write to all the Churches, because I must suddenly sail from Troas to
Neapolis, as the will <span id="fr_1118"></span>[1119](#fn_1118.md) \[of
the emperor\] enjoins, \[I beg that\] thou, as being acquainted with the
purpose <span id="fr_1119"></span>[1120](#fn_1119.md) of God, wilt write to
the adjacent Churches, that they also may act in like manner, such as
are able to do so sending messengers, <span
id="fr_1120"></span>[1121](#fn_1120.md) and the others transmitting letters
through those persons who are sent by thee, that thou <span
id="fr_1121"></span>[1122](#fn_1121.md) mayest be glorified by a work <span
id="fr_1122"></span>[1123](#fn_1122.md) which shall be remembered for ever,
as indeed thou art worthy to be. <span id="v.viii.viii-p6.1"></span>I
salute all by name, and in particular the wife of Epitropus, with all
her house and children. I salute Attalus, my beloved. I salute him who
shall be deemed worthy to go \[from you\] into Syria. Grace shall be
with him for ever, and with Polycarp that sends him. I pray for your
happiness for ever in our God, Jesus Christ, by whom continue ye in the
unity and under the protection of God, <span
id="fr_1123"></span>[1124](#fn_1123.md) I salute Alce, my dearly
beloved. <span id="fr_1124"></span>[1125](#fn_1124.md) <span
id="v.viii.viii-p8.1"></span>Fare ye well in the Lord.

<span id="v.viii.viii-p9"></span>Inasmuch, therefore, as I have not been
able to write to all Churches, because I must suddenly sail from Troas
to Neapolis, as the will <span id="fr_1125"></span>[1126](#fn_1125.md) \[of
the emperor\] enjoins, \[I beg that\] thou, as being acquainted with the
purpose <span id="fr_1126"></span>[1127](#fn_1126.md) of God, wilt write to
the adjacent Churches, that they also may act in like manner, such as
are able to do so sending messenger, and the others transmitting letters
through those persons who are sent by thee, that thou mayest be
glorified by a work <span id="fr_1127"></span>[1128](#fn_1127.md) which
shall be remembered for ever, as indeed thou art worthy to be. <span
id="v.viii.viii-p12.1"></span>I salute all by name, and in particular
the wife of Epitropus, with all her house and children. I salute
Attalus, my beloved. I salute him who shall be deemed worthy to go
\[from you\] into Syria. Grace shall be with him for ever, and with
Polycarp that sends him. I pray for your happiness for ever in our God,
Jesus Christ, by whom continue ye in the unity and under the protection
of God. I salute Alce, my dearly beloved. <span
id="fr_1128"></span>[1129](#fn_1128.md) Amen. <span
id="v.viii.viii-p13.1"></span>Grace \[be with you\]. Fare ye well in the
Lord.
