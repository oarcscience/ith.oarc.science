<span id="vii.ii.iii-p2"></span><span id="vii.ii.iii-p2.1"></span>Judas
walked about in this world a sad <span
id="fr_1742"></span>[1743](#fn_1742.md) example of impiety; for his body
having swollen to such an extent that he could not pass where a chariot
could pass easily, he was crushed by the chariot, so that his bowels
gushed out. <span id="fr_1743"></span>[1744](#fn_1743.md)

Theophylact, after quoting this passage, adds other particulars, as if
they were derived from Papias. \[But see Routh, i. pp. 26, 27.\] He says
that Judas’s eyes were so swollen that they could not be seen, even by
the optical instruments of physicians; and that the rest of his body was
covered with runnings and worms. He further states, that he died in a
solitary spot, which was left desolate until his time; and no one could
pass the place without stopping up his nose with his hands.
