<span id="ix.vi.xvii"></span>

### <span id="ix.vi.xvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVI.—Perfect righteousness was conferred neither by circumcision nor by any other legal ceremonies. The Decalogue, however, was not cancelled by Christ, but is always in force: men were never released from its commandments.

<span id="ix.vi.xvii-p1"></span>1. <span
id="ix.vi.xvii-p1.1"></span><span id="ix.vi.xvii-p1.2"></span>Moreover,
we learn from the Scripture itself, that God gave circumcision, not as
the completer of righteousness, but as a sign, that the race of Abraham
might continue recognisable. For it declares: “God said unto Abraham,
Every male among you shall be circumcised; and ye shall circumcise the
flesh of your foreskins, as a token of the covenant between Me and
you.” <span id="fr_3982"></span>[3983](#fn_3982.md) This same does Ezekiel
the prophet say with regard to the Sabbaths: “Also I gave them My
Sabbaths, to be a sign between Me and them, that they might know that I
am the Lord, that sanctify them.” <span
id="fr_3983"></span>[3984](#fn_3983.md) And in Exodus, God says to <span
id="page_481">p. 481</span> <span id="ix.vi.xvii-Page_481"></span>
Moses: “And ye shall observe My Sabbaths; for it shall be a sign between
Me and you for your generations.” <span
id="fr_3984"></span>[3985](#fn_3984.md) These things, then, were given for
a sign; but the signs were not unsymbolical, that is, neither unmeaning
nor to no purpose, inasmuch as they were given by a wise Artist; but the
circumcision after the flesh typified that after the Spirit. For “we,”
says the apostle, “have been circumcised with the circumcision made
without hands.” <span id="fr_3985"></span>[3986](#fn_3985.md) And the
prophet declares, “Circumcise the hardness of your heart.” <span
id="fr_3986"></span>[3987](#fn_3986.md) But the Sabbaths taught that we
should continue day by day in God’s service. <span
id="fr_3987"></span>[3988](#fn_3987.md) “For we have been counted,” says
the Apostle Paul, “all the day long as sheep for the slaughter;” <span
id="fr_3988"></span>[3989](#fn_3988.md) that is, consecrated \[to God\],
and ministering continually to our faith, and persevering in it, and
abstaining from all avarice, and not acquiring or possessing treasures
upon earth. <span id="fr_3989"></span>[3990](#fn_3989.md) Moreover, the
Sabbath of God (*requietio Dei*), that is, the kingdom, was, as it were,
indicated by created things; in which \[kingdom\], the man who shall
have persevered in serving God (*Deo assistere*) shall, in a state of
rest, partake of God’s table.

<span id="ix.vi.xvii-p10"></span>2. And that man was not justified by
these things, but that they were given as a sign to the people, this
fact shows,— that Abraham himself, without circumcision and without
observance of Sabbaths, “believed God, and it was imputed unto him for
righteousness; and he was called the friend of God.” <span
id="fr_3990"></span>[3991](#fn_3990.md) Then, again, Lot, without
circumcision, was brought out from Sodom, receiving salvation from God.
So also did Noah, pleasing God, although he was uncircumcised, receive
the dimensions \[of the ark\], of the world of the second race \[of
men\]. Enoch, too, pleasing God, without circumcision, discharged the
office of God’s legate to the angels although he was a man, and was
translated, and is preserved until now as a witness of the just judgment
of God, because the angels when they had transgressed fell to the earth
for judgment, but the man who pleased \[God\] was translated for
salvation. <span id="fr_3991"></span>[3992](#fn_3991.md) Moreover, all the
rest of the multitude of those righteous men who lived before Abraham,
and of those patriarchs who preceded Moses, were justified independently
of the things above mentioned, and without the law of Moses. As also
Moses himself says to the people in Deuteronomy: “The <span
class="upper"><span id="ix.vi.xvii-p12.2"></span>Lord</span> thy God
formed a covenant in Horeb. The <span class="upper"><span
id="ix.vi.xvii-p12.3"></span>Lord</span> formed not this covenant with
your fathers, but for you.” <span id="fr_3992"></span>[3993](#fn_3992.md)

<span id="ix.vi.xvii-p14"></span>3. Why, then, did the Lord not form the
covenant for the fathers? Because “the law was not established for
righteous men.” <span id="fr_3993"></span>[3994](#fn_3993.md) But the
righteous fathers had the meaning of the Decalogue written in their
hearts and souls, <span id="fr_3994"></span>[3995](#fn_3994.md) that is,
they loved the God who made them, and did no injury to their neighbour.
There was therefore no occasion that they should be cautioned by
prohibitory mandates (*correptoriis literis*), <span
id="fr_3995"></span>[3996](#fn_3995.md) because they had the righteousness
of the law in themselves. But when this righteousness and love to God
had passed into oblivion, and became extinct in Egypt, God did
necessarily, because of His great goodwill to men, reveal Himself by a
voice, and led the people with power out of Egypt, in order that man
might again become the disciple and follower of God; and He afflicted
those who were disobedient, that they should not contemn their Creator;
and He fed them with manna, that they might receive food for their souls
(*uti rationalem acciperent escam*); as also Moses says in Deuteronomy:
“And fed thee with manna, which thy fathers did not know, that thou
mightest know that man doth not live by bread alone; but by every word
of God proceeding out of His mouth doth man live.” <span
id="fr_3996"></span>[3997](#fn_3996.md) And it enjoined love to God, and
taught just dealing towards our neighbour, that we should neither be
unjust nor unworthy of God, who prepares man for His friendship through
the medium of the Decalogue, and likewise for agreement with his
neighbour,—matters which did certainly profit man himself; God, however,
standing in no need of anything from man.

<span id="ix.vi.xvii-p19"></span>4. <span
id="ix.vi.xvii-p19.1"></span>And therefore does the Scripture say,
“These words the Lord spake to all the assembly of the children of
Israel in the mount, and He added no more;” <span
id="fr_3997"></span>[3998](#fn_3997.md) for, as I have already observed, He
stood in need of nothing from them. And again Moses says: “And now
Israel, what doth the <span class="upper"><span
id="ix.vi.xvii-p20.2"></span>Lord</span> thy God require of thee, but to
fear the <span class="upper"><span
id="ix.vi.xvii-p20.3"></span>Lord</span> thy God, to walk in all His
ways, and to love Him, and to serve the <span class="upper"><span
id="ix.vi.xvii-p20.4"></span>Lord</span> thy God with all thy heart, and
with all thy soul?” <span id="fr_3998"></span>[3999](#fn_3998.md) Now these
things did indeed make man glorious, by supplying what was wanting to
him, namely, the friendship of God; but they profited God nothing, for
God did not at all <span id="page_482">p. 482</span> <span
id="ix.vi.xvii-Page_482"></span> stand in need of man’s love. For the
glory of God was wanting to man, which he could obtain in no other way
than by serving God. And therefore Moses says to them again: “Choose
life, that thou mayest live, and thy seed, to love the <span
class="upper"><span id="ix.vi.xvii-p21.2"></span>Lord</span> thy God, to
hear His voice, to cleave unto Him; for this is thy life, and the length
of thy days.” <span id="fr_3999"></span>[4000](#fn_3999.md) Preparing man
for this life, the Lord Himself did speak in His own person to all alike
the words of the Decalogue; and therefore, in like manner, do they
remain permanently with us, <span id="fr_4000"></span>[4001](#fn_4000.md)
receiving by means of His advent in the flesh, extension and increase,
but not abrogation.

<span id="ix.vi.xvii-p24"></span>5. The laws of bondage, however, were
one by one promulgated to the people by Moses, suited for their
instruction or for their punishment, as Moses himself declared: “And the
<span class="upper"><span id="ix.vi.xvii-p24.1"></span>Lord</span>
commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments.” <span
id="fr_4001"></span>[4002](#fn_4001.md) These things, therefore, which were
given for bondage, and for a sign to them, He cancelled by the new
covenant of liberty. But He has increased and widened those laws which
are natural, and noble, and common to all, granting to men largely and
without grudging, by means of adoption, to know God the Father, and to
love Him with the whole heart, and to follow His word unswervingly,
while they abstain not only from evil deeds, but even from the desire
after them. But He has also increased the feeling of reverence; for sons
should have more veneration than slaves, and greater love for their
father. And therefore the Lord says, “As to every idle word that men
have spoken, they shall render an account for it in the day of
judgment.” <span id="fr_4002"></span>[4003](#fn_4002.md) And, “he who has
looked upon a woman to lust after her, hath committed adultery with her
already in his heart;” <span id="fr_4003"></span>[4004](#fn_4003.md) and,
“he that is angry with his brother without a cause, shall be in danger
of the judgment.” <span id="fr_4004"></span>[4005](#fn_4004.md) \[All this
is declared,\] that we may know that we shall give account to God not of
deeds only, as slaves, but even of words and thoughts, as those who have
truly received the power of liberty, in which \[condition\] a man is
more severely tested, whether he will reverence, and fear, and love the
Lord. And for this reason Peter says “that we have not liberty as a
cloak of maliciousness,” <span id="fr_4005"></span>[4006](#fn_4005.md) but
as the means of testing and evidencing faith.

<span id="ix.vi.xvii-p12"></span> Massuet remarks here that Irenæus
makes a reference to the apocryphal book of Enoch, in which this history
is contained. It was the belief of the later Jews, followed by the
Christian fathers, that “the sons of God” ([Gen. vi.
2](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#002)<span id="ix.vi.xvii-p12.1"></span>.md)
who took wives of the daughters of men, were the apostate angels. The
LXX. translation of that passage accords with this view. See the

Bible*. \[See Paradise Lost, b. i. 323–431.\]
