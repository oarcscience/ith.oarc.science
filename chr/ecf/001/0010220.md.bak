### <span id="v.viii.vii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VII.—Request that Polycarp would send a messenger to Antioch.

<span id="v.viii.vii-p1"></span><span id="v.viii.vii-p1.1"></span><span
id="v.viii.vii-p1.2"></span><span id="v.viii.vii-p1.3"></span>Seeing
that the Church which is at Antioch in Syria is, as report has informed
me, at peace, through your prayers, I also am the more encouraged,
resting without anxiety in God, <span
id="fr_1108"></span>[1109](#fn_1108.md) if indeed by means of suffering I
may attain to God, so that, through your prayers, I may be found a
disciple \[of Christ\]. <span id="fr_1109"></span>[1110](#fn_1109.md) It is
fitting, O Polycarp, most blessed in God, to assemble a very
solemn <span id="fr_1110"></span>[1111](#fn_1110.md) council, and to elect
one whom you greatly love, and know to be a man of activity, who may be
designated the messenger of God; <span
id="fr_1111"></span>[1112](#fn_1111.md) and to bestow on him this honour
that he may go into Syria, and glorify your ever active love to the
praise of Christ. A Christian has not power over himself, but must
always be ready for <span id="fr_1112"></span>[1113](#fn_1112.md) the
service of God. Now, this work is both God’s and yours, when ye shall
have completed it to His glory. <span
id="fr_1113"></span>[1114](#fn_1113.md) For I trust that, through grace, ye
are prepared for every good work pertaining to God. Knowing, therefore,
your energetic love of the truth, I have exhorted you by this brief
Epistle.

<span id="v.viii.vii-p8"></span><span id="v.viii.vii-p8.1"></span><span
id="v.viii.vii-p8.2"></span><span id="v.viii.vii-p8.3"></span>Seeing
that the Church which is at Antioch in Syria is, as report has informed
me, at peace, through your prayers, I also am the more encouraged,
resting without anxiety in God, <span
id="fr_1114"></span>[1115](#fn_1114.md) if indeed by means of suffering I
may attain to God, so that, through your prayers, I may be found a
disciple \[of Christ\]. It is fitting, O Polycarp, most blessed in God,
to assemble a very solemn <span id="fr_1115"></span>[1116](#fn_1115.md)
council, and to elect one whom you greatly love, and know to be a man of
activity, who may be designated the messenger of God; <span
id="fr_1116"></span>[1117](#fn_1116.md) and to bestow on him the honour of
going into Syria, so that, going into Syria, he may glorify your ever
active love to the praise of God. A Christian has not power over
himself, but must always be ready for <span
id="fr_1117"></span>[1118](#fn_1117.md) the service of God. Now, this work
is both God’s and yours, when ye shall have completed it. For I trust
that, through grace, ye are prepared for every good work pertaining to
God. Knowing your energetic love of the truth, I have exhorted you by
this brief Epistle.
