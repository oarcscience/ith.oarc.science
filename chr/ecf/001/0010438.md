### <span id="viii.ii.lxv-p0.1"></span>Chapter LXV.—Administration of the sacraments.

<span id="viii.ii.lxv-p1"></span><span
id="viii.ii.lxv-p1.1"></span><span id="viii.ii.lxv-p1.2"></span>But we,
after we have thus washed him who has been convinced and has assented to
our teaching, bring him to the place where those who are called brethren
are assembled, in order that we may offer hearty prayers in common for
ourselves and for the baptized \[illuminated\] person, and for all
others in every place, that we may be counted worthy, now that we have
learned the truth, by our works also to be found good citizens and
keepers of the commandments, so that we may be saved with an everlasting
salvation. Having ended the prayers, we salute one another with a
kiss. <span id="fr_1907"></span>[1908](#fn_1907) <span
id="viii.ii.lxv-p2.2"></span>There is then brought to the president of
the brethren <span id="fr_1908"></span>[1909](#fn_1908) bread and a cup
of wine mixed with water; and he taking them, gives praise and glory to
the Father of the universe, through the name of the Son and of the Holy
Ghost, and offers thanks at considerable length for our being counted
worthy to receive these things at His hands. And when he has concluded
the prayers and thanksgivings, all the people present express their
assent by saying Amen. This word Amen answers in the Hebrew language to
<span class="Greek"><span id="viii.ii.lxv-p3.2"></span>γένοιτο</span>
\[so be it\]. And when the president has given thanks, and all the
people have expressed their assent, those who are called by us deacons
give to each of those present to partake of the bread and wine mixed
with water over which the thanksgiving was pronounced, and to those who
are absent they carry away a portion.

<span id="viii.ii.lxv-p2"></span> The kiss of charity, the kiss of
peace, or “the peace” (<span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.ii.lxv-p2.1"></span>ἡ εἰπήνη</span>), was enjoined by the
Apostle Paul in his Epistles to the Corinthians, Thessalonians, and
Romans, and thence passed into a common Christian usage. It was
continued in the Western Church, under regulations to prevent its abuse,
until the thirteenth century. Stanley remarks (*Corinthians*, i. 414),
“It is still continued in the worship of the Coptic Church.”

<span id="fn_1908"></span>[185:1909](0010438.htm#fr_1908) <span

<span id="viii.ii.lxv-p3"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.ii.lxv-p3.1"></span>τῷ προεστῶτι τῶν ἀδελφῶν</span>. This
expression may quite legitimately be translated, “to that one of the
brethren who was presiding.”
