### <span id="v.vii.xi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XI.—Request to them to send a messenger to Antioch.

<span id="v.vii.xi-p1"></span><span id="v.vii.xi-p1.1"></span>Your
prayer has reached to the Church which is at Antioch in Syria. Coming
from that place bound with chains, most acceptable to God, <span
id="fr_1044"></span>[1045](#fn_1044) I salute all; I who am not worthy
to be styled from thence, inasmuch as I am the least of them.
Nevertheless, according to the will of God, I have been thought worthy
\[of this honour\], not that I have any sense <span
id="fr_1045"></span>[1046](#fn_1045) \[of having deserved it\], but by
the grace of God, which I wish may be perfectly given to me, that
through your prayers I may attain to God. In order, therefore, that your
work may be complete both on earth and in heaven, it is fitting that,
for the honour of God, your Church should elect some worthy
delegate; <span id="fr_1046"></span>[1047](#fn_1046) so that he,
journeying into Syria, may congratulate them that they are \[now\] at
peace, and are restored to <span id="fr_1047"></span>[1048](#fn_1047)
their proper greatness, and that their proper constitution <span
id="fr_1048"></span>[1049](#fn_1048) has been re-established among them.
It seems then to me a becoming thing, that you should send some one of
your number with an epistle, so that, in company with them, he may
rejoice <span id="fr_1049"></span>[1050](#fn_1049) over the tranquility
which, according to the will of God, they have obtained, and because
that, through your prayers, they have now reached the harbour. As
persons who are perfect, ye should also aim at <span
id="fr_1050"></span>[1051](#fn_1050) those things which are perfect. For
when ye are desirous to do well, God is also ready to assist you.

<span id="v.vii.xi-p9"></span><span id="v.vii.xi-p9.1"></span>Your
prayers have reached to the Church of Antioch, and it is at peace.
Coming from that place bound, I salute all; I who am not worthy to be
styled from thence, inasmuch as I am the least of them. Nevertheless,
according to the will of God, I have been thought worthy \[of this
honour\], not that I have any sense <span
id="fr_1051"></span>[1052](#fn_1051) \[of having deserved it\], but by
the grace of God, which I wish may be perfectly given to me, that
through your prayers I may attain to God. In order, therefore, that your
work may be complete both on earth and in heaven, it is fitting that,
for the honour of God, your Church should elect some worthy
delegate; <span id="fr_1052"></span>[1053](#fn_1052) so that he,
journeying into Syria, may congratulate them that they are \[now\] at
peace, and are restored to their proper greatness, and that their proper
constitution <span id="fr_1053"></span>[1054](#fn_1053) has been
re-established among them. What appears to me proper to be done is this,
that you should send some one of your number with an epistle, so that,
in company with them, he may rejoice over the tranquillity which,
according to the will of God, they have obtained, and because that,
through your prayers, I have secured Christ as a safe harbour. As
persons who are perfect, ye should also aim at <span
id="fr_1054"></span>[1055](#fn_1054) those things which are perfect. For
when ye are desirous to do well, God is also ready to assist you.
