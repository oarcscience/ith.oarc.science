### <span id="viii.iv.cxlii-p0.1"></span>Chapter CXLII.—The Jews return thanks, and leave Justin.

<span id="viii.iv.cxlii-p1"></span>Then Trypho, after a little delay,
said, “You see that it was not intentionally that we came to discuss
these points. And I confess that I have been particularly pleased with
the conference; and I think that these are of quite the same opinion as
myself. For we have found more than we expected, and more than it was
possible to have expected. And if we could do this more frequently, we
should be much helped in the searching of the Scriptures themselves. But
since,” he said, “you are on the eve of departure, and expect daily to
set sail, do not hesitate to remember us as friends when you are gone.”

<span id="viii.iv.cxlii-p2"></span>“For my part,” I replied, “if I had
remained, I would have wished to do the same thing daily. But now, since
I expect, with God’s will and aid, to set sail, I exhort you to give all
diligence in this very great struggle for your own salvation, and to be
earnest in setting a higher value on the Christ of the Almighty God than
on your own teachers.”

<span id="viii.iv.cxlii-p3"></span>After this they left me, wishing me
safety in my voyage, and from every misfortune. And I, praying for them,
said, “I can wish no better thing for you, sirs, than this, that,
recognising in this way that intelligence is given to every man, you may
be of the same opinion as ourselves, and believe that Jesus is the
Christ of God.” <span id="fr_2491"></span>[2492](#fn_2491.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_2491"></span>[270:2492](0010603.htm#fr_2491.md) <span

<span id="viii.iv.cxlii-p4"></span> The last sentence is very dubious.
For <span class="Greek"><span id="viii.iv.cxlii-p4.1"></span>παντὶ
ἀνθρώπινον νοῦν</span> read <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.iv.cxlii-p4.2"></span>παντὶ ἀνθρώπῳ τὸν νοῦν</span>. For <span
class="Greek"><span id="viii.iv.cxlii-p4.3"></span>ποιήσητε</span> read
<span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.iv.cxlii-p4.4"></span>πιστεύσητε</span>. And lastly, for <span
class="Greek"><span id="viii.iv.cxlii-p4.5"></span>τὸ ἡμῶν</span> read
<span class="Greek"><span id="viii.iv.cxlii-p4.6"></span>τὸν
᾽Ιησοῦν</span>.

<span id="viii.iv.cxlii-p5"></span>\[But there is no doubt about the
touching beauty of this close; and truly Trypho seems “not far from the
kingdom of God.” Note the marvellous knowledge of the Old Testament
Scriptures, which Justin had acquired, and which he could use in
conversation. His quotations from the Psalms, *memoriter*, are more
accurate than others. See Kaye, p. 141.\]
