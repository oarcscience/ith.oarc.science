### <span id="ix.vii.xxviii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXVII.—The future judgment by Christ. Communion with and separation from the divine being. The eternal punishment of unbelievers.

<span id="ix.vii.xxviii-p1"></span>1. <span
id="ix.vii.xxviii-p1.1"></span>If the Father, then, does not exercise
judgment, \[it follows\] that judgment does not belong to Him, or that
He consents to all those actions which take place; and if He does not
judge, all persons will be equal, and accounted in the same condition.
The advent of Christ will therefore be without an object, yea, absurd,
inasmuch as \[in that case\] He exercises no judicial power. For “He
came to divide a man against his father, and the daughter against the
mother, and the daughter-in-law against the mother-in-law;” <span
id="fr_4682"></span>[4683](#fn_4682.md) and when two are in one bed, to
take the one, and to leave the other; and of two women grinding at the
mill, to take one and leave the other: <span
id="fr_4683"></span>[4684](#fn_4683.md) \[also\] at the time of the end, to
order the reapers to collect first the tares together, and bind them in
bundles, and burn them with unquenchable fire, but to gather up the
wheat into the barn; <span id="fr_4684"></span>[4685](#fn_4684.md) and to
call the lambs into the kingdom prepared for them, but to send the goats
into everlasting fire, which has been prepared by His Father for the
devil and his angels. <span id="fr_4685"></span>[4686](#fn_4685.md) And why
is this? Has the Word come for the ruin and for the resurrection of
many? For the ruin, certainly, of those who do not believe Him, to whom
also He has threatened a greater damnation in the judgment-day than that
of Sodom and Gomorrah; <span id="fr_4686"></span>[4687](#fn_4686.md) but
for the resurrection of believers, and those who do the will of His
Father in heaven. If then the advent of the Son comes indeed alike to
all, but is for the purpose of judging, and separating the believing
from the unbelieving, since, as those who believe do His will agreeably
to their own choice, and as, \[also\] agreeably to their own choice, the
disobedient do not consent to His doctrine; it is manifest that His
Father has made all in a like condition, each person having a choice of
his own, and a free understanding; and that He has regard to all things,
and exercises a providence over all, “making His sun to rise upon the
evil and on the good, and sending rain upon the just and unjust.” <span
id="fr_4687"></span>[4688](#fn_4687.md)

<span id="ix.vii.xxviii-p8"></span>2. <span
id="ix.vii.xxviii-p8.1"></span><span id="ix.vii.xxviii-p8.2"></span>And
to as many as continue in their love towards God, does He grant
communion with Him. But communion with God is life and light, and the
enjoyment of all the benefits which He has in store. But on as many as,
according to their own choice, depart from God, He inflicts that
separation from Himself which they have chosen of their own accord. But
separation from God is death, and separation from light is darkness; and
separation from God consists in the loss of all the benefits which He
has in store. Those, therefore, who cast away by apostasy these
forementioned things, being in fact destitute of all good, do experience
every kind of punishment. God, however, does not punish them immediately
of Himself, but that punishment falls upon them because they are
destitute of all that is good. <span id="ix.vii.xxviii-p8.3"></span>Now,
good things are eternal and without end with God, and therefore the loss
of these is also eternal and never-ending. It is in this matter just as
occurs in the case of a flood of light: those who have blinded
themselves, or have been blinded by others, are for ever deprived of the
enjoyment of light. It is not, \[however\], that the light has inflicted
upon them the penalty of blindness, but it is that the blindness itself
has brought calamity upon them: and therefore the Lord declared, “He
that believeth in Me is not condemned,” <span
id="fr_4688"></span>[4689](#fn_4688.md) that is, is not separated from God,
for he is united to God through faith. On the other hand, He says, “He
that believeth not is condemned already, because he has not believed in
the name of the only-begotten Son of God;” that is, he separated himself
from God of his own accord. “For this is the condemnation, that light is
come into this world, and men have loved darkness rather than light. For
every one who doeth evil hateth the light, and cometh not to the light,
lest his deeds should be reproved. But he that doeth truth cometh to the
light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that he has wrought them in
God.”
