### <span id="viii.iv.cxxxiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter CXXXIII.—The hard-heartedness of the Jews, for whom the Christians pray.

<span id="viii.iv.cxxxiii-p1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.cxxxiii-p1.1"></span> “Now, although these and all other
such unexpected and marvellous works were wrought amongst and seen by
you at different times, yet you are convicted by the prophets of having
gone to such a length as offering your own children to demons; and
besides all this, of having dared to do such things against Christ; and
you still dare to do them: for all which may it be granted to you to
obtain mercy and salvation from God and His Christ. For God, knowing
before that you would do such things, pronounced this curse upon you by
the prophet Isaiah: ‘Woe unto their soul! they have devised evil counsel
against themselves, saying, Let us bind the righteous man, for he is
distasteful to us. Therefore they shall eat the fruit of their own
doings. Woe to the wicked! evil, according to the works of his hands,
shall befall him. O my people, your exactors glean you, and those who
extort from you shall rule over you. O my people, they who call you
blessed cause you to err, and disorder the way of your paths. But now
the Lord shall assist His people to judgment, and He shall enter into
judgment with the elders of the people and the princes thereof. But why
have you burnt up my vineyard? and why is the spoil of the poor found in
your houses? Why do you wrong my people, and put to shame the
countenance of the humble?’ <span id="fr_2465"></span>[2466](#fn_2465.md)
Again, in other words, the same prophet spake to the same effect: ‘Woe
unto them that draw their iniquity as with a long cord, and their
transgressions as with the harness of an heifer’s yoke: who say, Let His
speed come near, and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel come,
that we may know it. Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil!
that put light for darkness, and darkness for light! that put bitter for
sweet, and sweet for bitter! Woe unto them that are wise in their own
eyes, and prudent in their own sight! Woe unto those that are mighty
among you, who drink wine, who are men of strength, who mingle strong
drink! who justify the wicked for a reward, and take away justice from
the righteous! Therefore, as the stubble shall be burnt by the coal of
fire, and utterly consumed by the burning flame, their root shall be as
wool, and their flower shall go up like dust. For they would not have
the law of the Lord of Sabaoth, but despised <span
id="fr_2466"></span>[2467](#fn_2466.md) the word of the Lord, the Holy One
of Israel. And the Lord of Sabaoth was very angry, and laid His hands
upon them, and smote them; and He was provoked against the mountains,
and their carcases were in the midst like dung on the road. And for all
this they have not repented, <span id="fr_2467"></span>[2468](#fn_2467.md)
but their hand is still high.’ <span
id="fr_2468"></span>[2469](#fn_2468.md) For verily your hand is high to
commit evil, because ye slew the Christ, and do not repent of it; but so
far from that, ye hate and murder us who have believed through Him in
the God and Father of all, as often as ye can; and ye curse Him without
ceasing, as well as those who side with Him; while all of us pray for
you, and for all men, as our Christ and Lord taught us to do, when He
enjoined us to pray even for our enemies, and to love them that hate us,
and to bless them that curse us.
