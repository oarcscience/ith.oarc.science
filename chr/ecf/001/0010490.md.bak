### <span id="viii.iv.xxix-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXIX.—Christ is useless to those who observe the law.

<span id="viii.iv.xxix-p1"></span>“Let us glorify God, all nations
gathered together; for He has also visited us. Let us glorify Him by the
King of glory, by the Lord of hosts. For He has been gracious towards
the Gentiles also; and our sacrifices He esteems more grateful than
yours. What need, then, have I of circumcision, who have been witnessed
to by God? What need have I of that other baptism, who <span

have been baptized with the Holy Ghost? I think that while I mention
this, I would persuade even those who are possessed of scanty
intelligence. For these words have neither been prepared by me, nor
embellished by the art of man; but David sung them, Isaiah preached
them, Zechariah proclaimed them, and Moses wrote them. Are you
acquainted with them, Trypho? They are contained in your Scriptures, or
rather not yours, but ours. <span id="fr_2023"></span>[2024](#fn_2023.md)
For we believe them; but you, though you read them, do not catch the
spirit that is in them. Be not offended at, or reproach us with, the
bodily uncircumcision with which God has created us; and think it not
strange that we drink hot water on the Sabbaths, since God directs the
government of the universe on this day equally as on all others; and the
priests, as on other days, so on this, are ordered to offer sacrifices;
and there are so many righteous men who have performed none of these
legal ceremonies, and yet are witnessed to by God Himself.
