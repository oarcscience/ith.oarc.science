### <span id="vi.ii.ix-p0.1"></span>Chapter IX.—The spiritual meaning of circumcision.

<span id="vi.ii.ix-p1"></span><span id="vi.ii.ix-p1.1"></span><span
id="vi.ii.ix-p1.2"></span>He speaks moreover concerning our ears, how He
hath circumcised both them and our heart. The Lord saith in the prophet,
“In the hearing of the ear they obeyed me.” <span
id="fr_1547"></span>[1548](#fn_1547) And again He saith, “By hearing,
those shall hear who are afar off; they shall know what I have
done.” <span id="fr_1548"></span>[1549](#fn_1548) And, “Be ye
circumcised in your hearts, saith the Lord.” <span
id="fr_1549"></span>[1550](#fn_1549) And again He says, “Hear, O Israel,
for these things saith the Lord thy God.” <span
id="fr_1550"></span>[1551](#fn_1550) And once more the Spirit of the
Lord proclaims, “Who is he that wishes to live for ever? By hearing let
him hear the voice of my servant.” <span
id="fr_1551"></span>[1552](#fn_1551) And again He saith, “Hear, O
heaven, and give ear, O earth, for God <span
id="fr_1552"></span>[1553](#fn_1552) hath spoken.” <span
id="fr_1553"></span>[1554](#fn_1553) These are in proof. <span
id="fr_1554"></span>[1555](#fn_1554) And again He saith, “Hear the word
of the Lord, ye rulers of this people.” <span
id="fr_1555"></span>[1556](#fn_1555) And again He saith, “Hear, ye
children, the voice of one crying in the wilderness.” <span
id="fr_1556"></span>[1557](#fn_1556) Therefore He hath circumcised our
ears, that we might hear His word and believe, for the circumcision in
which they trusted is abolished. <span
id="fr_1557"></span>[1558](#fn_1557) For He declared that circumcision
was not of the flesh, but they transgressed because an evil angel
deluded them. <span id="fr_1558"></span>[1559](#fn_1558) He saith to
them, “These things saith the Lord your God”—(here <span
id="fr_1559"></span>[1560](#fn_1559) I find a new <span
id="fr_1560"></span>[1561](#fn_1560) commandment)—“Sow not among thorns,
but circumcise yourselves to the Lord.” <span
id="fr_1561"></span>[1562](#fn_1561) And why speaks He thus: “Circumcise
the stubbornness of your heart, and harden not your neck?” <span
id="fr_1562"></span>[1563](#fn_1562) And again: “Behold, saith the Lord,
all the nations are uncircumcised <span
id="fr_1563"></span>[1564](#fn_1563) in the flesh, but this people are
uncircumcised in heart.” <span id="fr_1564"></span>[1565](#fn_1564) But
thou wilt say, “Yea, verily the people are circumcised for a seal.” But
so also is every Syrian and Arab, and all the priests of idols: are
these then also within the bond of His covenant? <span
id="fr_1565"></span>[1566](#fn_1565) Yea, the Egyptians also practise
circumcision. <span id="vi.ii.ix-p20.1"></span>Learn then, my children,
concerning all things richly, <span id="fr_1566"></span>[1567](#fn_1566)
that Abraham, the first who enjoined circumcision, looking forward in
spirit to Jesus, practised that rite, having received the
mysteries <span id="fr_1567"></span>[1568](#fn_1567) of the three
letters. For \[the Scripture\] saith, “And Abraham circumcised <span
id="page_143">p. 143</span> <span id="vi.ii.ix-Page_143"></span> ten,
and eight, and three hundred men of his household.” <span
id="fr_1568"></span>[1569](#fn_1568) What, then, was the knowledge given
to him in this? Learn the eighteen first, and then the three
hundred. <span id="fr_1569"></span>[1570](#fn_1569) The ten and the
eight are thus denoted—Ten by <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ii.ix-p24.1"></span>Ι</span>, and Eight by <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.ii.ix-p24.2"></span>Η</span>. <span
id="fr_1570"></span>[1571](#fn_1570) You have \[the initials of the,
name of\] Jesus. And because <span id="fr_1571"></span>[1572](#fn_1571)
the cross was to express the grace \[of our redemption\] by the letter
<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.ii.ix-p26.2"></span>Τ</span>, he says
also, “Three Hundred.” He signifies, therefore, Jesus by two letters,
and the cross by one. He knows this, who has put within us the
engrafted <span id="fr_1572"></span>[1573](#fn_1572) gift of His
doctrine. No one has been admitted by me to a more excellent piece of
knowledge <span id="fr_1573"></span>[1574](#fn_1573) than this, but I
know that ye are worthy.

<span id="vi.ii.ix-p9"></span> In proof of the spiritual meaning of
circumcision; but Hilgenfeld joins the words to the preceding sentence.

<span id="fn_1556"></span>[142:1557](0010345.htm#fr_1556) <span
id="vi.ii.ix-p10.2"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.ix-p11"></span> Cod. Sin. reads, “it is the voice,”
corrected, however, as above.

<span id="fn_1557"></span>[142:1558](0010345.htm#fr_1557) <span
id="vi.ii.ix-p11.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.ix-p12"></span> Cod. Sin. has, “that we might hear the
word, and not only believe,” plainly a corrupt text.

<span id="fn_1558"></span>[142:1559](0010345.htm#fr_1558) <span
id="vi.ii.ix-p12.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.ix-p13"></span> Cod. Sin., at first hand, has “slew
them,” but is corrected as above.

<span id="fn_1559"></span>[142:1560](0010345.htm#fr_1559) <span
id="vi.ii.ix-p13.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.ix-p14"></span> The meaning is here very obscure, but
the above rendering and punctuation seem preferable to any other.

<span id="fn_1560"></span>[142:1561](0010345.htm#fr_1560) <span
id="vi.ii.ix-p14.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.ix-p15"></span> Cod. Sin., with several other <span
class="upper"><span id="vi.ii.ix-p15.1"></span>mss.</span>, leaves out
“new.”

<span id="fn_1561"></span>[142:1562](0010345.htm#fr_1561) <span
id="vi.ii.ix-p15.2"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.ix-p16"></span> [Jer. iv.
3](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#003)<span id="vi.ii.ix-p16.1"></span>.
Cod. Sin. has “God” instead of “Lord.”

id="vi.ii.ix-p16.2"></span>

<span id="fn_1563"></span>[142:1564](0010345.htm#fr_1563) <span
id="vi.ii.ix-p17.2"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.ix-p18"></span> This contrast seems to be marked in the
original. Cod. Sin. has, “Behold, receive again.”

<span id="fn_1564"></span>[142:1565](0010345.htm#fr_1564) <span

<span id="fn_1565"></span>[142:1566](0010345.htm#fr_1565) <span
id="vi.ii.ix-p19.2"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.ix-p20"></span> Dressel and Hilgenfeld read, “their
covenant,” as does Cod. Sin.; we have followed Hefele.

<span id="fn_1566"></span>[142:1567](0010345.htm#fr_1566) <span
id="vi.ii.ix-p20.2"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.ix-p21"></span> Cod. Sin. has “children of love,”
omitting “richly,” and inserting it before “looking forward.”

<span id="fn_1567"></span>[142:1568](0010345.htm#fr_1567) <span
id="vi.ii.ix-p21.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.ix-p22"></span> Literally, “doctrines.”

pause.”

id="vi.ii.ix-p24.3"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.ix-p25"></span> This sentence is altogether omitted by
inadvertence in Cod. Sin.

<span id="fn_1571"></span>[143:1572](0010345.htm#fr_1571) <span
id="vi.ii.ix-p25.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.ix-p26"></span> Some <span class="upper"><span
id="vi.ii.ix-p26.1"></span>mss.</span> here read, “and further:” the
above is the reading in Cod. Sin., and is also that of Hefele.

<span id="fn_1572"></span>[143:1573](0010345.htm#fr_1572) <span
id="vi.ii.ix-p26.3"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.ix-p27"></span> This is rendered in the Latin, “the more
profound gift,” referring, as it does, to the *Gnosis* of the initiated.
The same word is used in chap. i.

<span id="fn_1573"></span>[143:1574](0010345.htm#fr_1573) <span
id="vi.ii.ix-p27.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.ix-p28"></span> Literally, “has learned a more germane
(or genuine) word from me,” being an idle vaunt on account of the
ingenuity in interpreting Scripture he has just displayed.
