### <span id="v.iv.xiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIII.—Conclusion.

<span id="v.iv.xiii-p1"></span><span id="v.iv.xiii-p1.1"></span>The love
of the Smyrnæans and Ephesians salutes you. Remember in your prayers the
Church which is in Syria, from which also I am not worthy to receive my
appellation, being the last <span id="fr_814"></span>[815](#fn_814) of
them. Fare ye well in Jesus Christ, while ye continue subject to the
bishop, as to the command \[of God\], and in like manner to the
presbytery. And do ye, every man, love one another with an undivided
heart. Let my spirit be sanctified <span
id="fr_815"></span>[816](#fn_815) by yours, not only now, but also when
I shall attain to God. For I am as yet exposed to danger. <span
id="v.iv.xiii-p3.4"></span>But the Father is faithful in Jesus Christ to
fulfil both mine and your petitions: in whom may ye be found
unblameable.

<span id="v.iv.xiii-p4"></span><span id="v.iv.xiii-p4.1"></span>The love
of the Smyrnæans and Ephesians salutes you. Remember our Church which is
in Syria, from which I am not worthy to receive my appellation, being
the last <span id="fr_816"></span>[817](#fn_816) of those of that place.
<span id="v.iv.xiii-p5.1"></span>Fare ye well in the Lord Jesus Christ,
while ye continue subject to the bishop, and in like manner to the
presbyters and to the deacons. And do ye, every man, love one another
with an undivided heart. My spirit salutes you, <span
id="fr_817"></span>[818](#fn_817) not only now, but also when I shall
have attained to God; for I am as yet exposed to danger. <span
id="v.iv.xiii-p6.4"></span>But the Father of Jesus Christ is faithful to
fulfil both mine and your petitions: in whom may we be found without
spot. May I have joy of you in the Lord.
