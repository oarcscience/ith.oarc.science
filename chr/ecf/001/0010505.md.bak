### <span id="viii.iv.xliv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XLIV.—The Jews in vain promise themselves salvation, which cannot be obtained except through Christ.

<span id="viii.iv.xliv-p1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.xliv-p1.1"></span><span id="viii.iv.xliv-p1.2"></span><span
id="viii.iv.xliv-p1.3"></span>“For thus, so far as you are concerned, I
shall be found in all respects innocent, if I strive earnestly to
persuade you by bringing forward demonstrations. But if you remain
hard-hearted, or weak in \[forming\] a resolution, on account of death,
which is the lot of the Christians, and are unwilling to assent to the
truth, you shall appear as the authors of your own \[evils\]. And you
deceive yourselves while you fancy that, because you are the seed of
Abraham after the flesh, therefore you shall fully inherit the good
things announced to be bestowed by God through Christ. For no one, not
even of them, <span id="fr_2076"></span>[2077](#fn_2076.md) has anything to
look for, but only those who in mind are assimilated to the faith of
Abraham, and who have <span id="page_217">p. 217</span> <span
id="viii.iv.xliv-Page_217"></span> recognised all the mysteries: for I
say, <span id="fr_2077"></span>[2078](#fn_2077.md) that some injunctions
were laid on you in reference to the worship of God and practice of
righteousness; but some injunctions and acts were likewise mentioned in
reference to the mystery of Christ, on account of <span
id="fr_2078"></span>[2079](#fn_2078.md) the hardness of your people’s
hearts. And that this is so, God makes known in Ezekiel, \[when\] He
said concerning it: ‘If Noah and Jacob <span
id="fr_2079"></span>[2080](#fn_2079.md) and Daniel should beg either sons
or daughters, the request would not be granted them.’ <span
id="fr_2080"></span>[2081](#fn_2080.md) And in Isaiah, of the very same
matter He spake thus: ‘The Lord God said, they shall both go forth and
look on the members \[of the bodies\] of the men that have transgressed.
For their worm shall not die, and their fire shall not be quenched, and
they shall be a gazing-stock to all flesh.’ <span
id="fr_2081"></span>[2082](#fn_2081.md) <span
id="viii.iv.xliv-p7.2"></span>So that it becomes you to eradicate this
hope from your souls, and hasten to know in what way forgiveness of
sins, and a hope of inheriting the promised good things, shall be yours.
But there is no other \[way\] than this, —to become acquainted with this
Christ, to be washed in the fountain <span
id="fr_2082"></span>[2083](#fn_2082.md) spoken of by Isaiah for the
remission of sins; and for the rest, to live sinless lives.”

<span id="viii.iv.xliv-p2"></span> i.e., of Abraham’s seed.

id="viii.iv.xliv-p2.1"></span>

<span id="viii.iv.xliv-p3"></span> Justin distinguishes between such
essential acts as related to God’s worship and the establishment of
righteousness, and such ceremonial observances as had a mere temporary
significance. The recognition of this distinction he alleges to be
necessary to salvation: necessary in this sense, that justification must
be placed not on the latter, but on the former; and without such
recognition, a Jew would, as Justin says, rest his hopes on his noble
descent from Abraham.

<span id="fn_2078"></span>[217:2079](0010505.htm#fr_2078.md) <span
id="viii.iv.xliv-p3.1"></span>

<span id="viii.iv.xliv-p4"></span> More probably, “or on account of,”
etc.

id="viii.iv.xliv-p4.1"></span>

<span id="viii.iv.xliv-p5"></span> In Bible, “Job;” Maranus prefers
“Jacob,” and thinks the mention of his name very suitable to disprove
the arrogant claims of Jacob’s posterity.
