### <span id="ix.vi.viii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VII.—Recapitulation of the foregoing argument, showing that Abraham, through the revelation of the Word, knew the Father, and the coming of the Son of God. For this cause, he rejoiced to see the day of Christ, when the promises made to him should be fulfilled. The fruit of this rejoicing has flowed to posterity, viz., to those who are partakers in the faith of Abraham, but not to the Jews who reject the Word of God.

<span id="ix.vi.viii-p1"></span>1. <span
id="ix.vi.viii-p1.1"></span>Therefore Abraham also, knowing the Father
through the Word, who made heaven and earth, confessed Him to be God;
and having learned, by an announcement \[made to him\], that the Son of
God would be a man among men, by whose advent his seed should be as the
stars of heaven, he desired to see that day, so that he might himself
also embrace Christ; and, seeing it through the spirit of prophecy, he
rejoiced. <span id="fr_3866"></span>[3867](#fn_3866.md) Wherefore Simeon
also, one of his descendants, carried fully out the rejoicing of the
patriarch, and said: “Lord, now lettest Thou Thy servant depart in
peace. For mine eyes have seen Thy salvation, which Thou hast prepared
<span id="page_470">p. 470</span> <span id="ix.vi.viii-Page_470"></span>
before the face of all people: a light for the revelation of the
Gentiles, <span id="fr_3867"></span>[3868](#fn_3867.md) and the glory of
the people Israel.” <span id="fr_3868"></span>[3869](#fn_3868.md) And the
angels, in like manner, announced tidings of great joy to the shepherds
who were keeping watch by night. <span
id="fr_3869"></span>[3870](#fn_3869.md) Moreover, Mary said, “My soul doth
magnify the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my
salvation;” <span id="fr_3870"></span>[3871](#fn_3870.md) —the rejoicing of
Abraham descending upon those who sprang from him,—those, namely, who
were watching, and who beheld Christ, and believed in Him; while, on the
other hand, there was a reciprocal rejoicing which passed backwards from
the children to Abraham, who did also desire to see the day of Christ’s
coming. Rightly, then, did our Lord bear witness to him, saying, “Your
father Abraham rejoiced to see my day; and he saw it, and was glad.”

<span id="ix.vi.viii-p7"></span>2. For not alone upon Abraham’s account
did He say these things, but also that He might point out how all who
have known God from the beginning, and have foretold the advent of
Christ, have received the revelation from the Son Himself; who also in
the last times was made visible and passible, and spake with the human
race, that He might from the stones raise up children unto Abraham, and
fulfil the promise which God had given him, and that He might make his
seed as the stars of heaven, <span id="fr_3871"></span>[3872](#fn_3871.md)
as John the Baptist says: “For God is able from these stones to raise up
children unto Abraham.” <span id="fr_3872"></span>[3873](#fn_3872.md) Now,
this Jesus did by drawing us off from the religion of stones, and
bringing us over from hard and fruitless cogitations, and establishing
in us a faith like to Abraham. As Paul does also testify, saying that we
are children of Abraham because of the similarity of our faith, and the
promise of inheritance. <span id="fr_3873"></span>[3874](#fn_3873.md)

<span id="ix.vi.viii-p11"></span>3. He is therefore one and the same
God, who called Abraham and gave him the promise. But He is the Creator,
who does also through Christ prepare lights in the world, \[namely\]
those who believe from among the Gentiles. And He says, “Ye are the
light of the world;” <span id="fr_3874"></span>[3875](#fn_3874.md) that is,
as the stars of heaven. Him, therefore, I have rightly shown to be known
by no man, unless by the Son, and to whomsoever the Son shall reveal
Him. But the Son reveals the Father to all to whom He wills that He
should be known; and neither without the goodwill of the Father nor
without the agency of the Son, can any man know God. Wherefore did the
Lord say to His disciples, “I am the way, the truth, and the life and no
man cometh unto the Father but by Me. If ye had known Me, ye would have
known My Father also: and from henceforth ye have both known Him, and
have seen Him.” <span id="fr_3875"></span>[3876](#fn_3875.md) From these
words it is evident, that He is known by the Son, that is, by the Word.

<span id="ix.vi.viii-p14"></span>4. Therefore have the Jews departed
from God, in not receiving His Word, but imagining that they could know
the Father \[apart\] by Himself, without the Word, that is, without the
Son; they being ignorant of that God who spake in human shape to
Abraham, <span id="fr_3876"></span>[3877](#fn_3876.md) and again to Moses,
saying, “I have surely seen the affliction of My people in Egypt, and I
have come down to deliver them.” <span
id="fr_3877"></span>[3878](#fn_3877.md) For the Son, who is the Word of
God, arranged these things beforehand from the beginning, the Father
being in no want of angels, in order that He might call the creation
into being, and form man, for whom also the creation was made; nor,
again, standing in need of any instrumentality for the framing of
created things, or for the ordering of those things which had reference
to man; while, \[at the same time,\] He has a vast and unspeakable
number of servants. For His *offspring* and His *similitude* <span
id="fr_3878"></span>[3879](#fn_3878.md) do minister to Him in every
respect; that is, the Son and the Holy Spirit, the Word and Wisdom; whom
all the angels serve, and to whom they are subject. Vain, therefore, are
those who, because of that declaration, “No man knoweth the Father, but
the Son,” <span id="fr_3879"></span>[3880](#fn_3879.md) do introduce
another unknown Father.
