<span id="viii.iv.lxxxvii"></span>

### <span id="viii.iv.lxxxvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter LXXXVII.—Trypho maintains in objection these words: “And shall rest on Him,” etc. They are explained by Justin.

<span id="viii.iv.lxxxvii-p1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.lxxxvii-p1.1"></span>Hereupon Trypho, after I had spoken
these <span id="page_243">p. 243</span> <span
id="viii.iv.lxxxvii-Page_243"></span> words, said, “Do not now suppose
that I am endeavouring, by asking what I do ask, to overturn the
statements you have made; but I wish to receive information respecting
those very points about which I now inquire. Tell me, then, how, when
the Scripture asserts by Isaiah, ‘There shall come forth a rod from the
root of Jesse; and a flower shall grow up from the root of Jesse; and
the Spirit of God shall rest upon Him, the spirit of wisdom and
understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge
and piety: and the spirit of the fear of the Lord shall fill Him:’ <span
id="fr_2291"></span>[2292](#fn_2291) (now you admitted to me,” continued
he, “that this referred to Christ, and you maintain Him to be
pre-existent God, and having become incarnate by God’s will, to be born
man by the Virgin:) how He can be demonstrated to have been
pre-existent, who is filled with the powers of the Holy Ghost, which the
Scripture by Isaiah enumerates, as if He were in lack of them?”

<span id="viii.iv.lxxxvii-p3"></span>Then I replied, “You have inquired
most discreetly and most prudently, for truly there does seem to be a
difficulty; but listen to what I say, that you may perceive the reason
of this also. <span id="viii.iv.lxxxvii-p3.1"></span>The Scripture says
that these enumerated powers of the Spirit have come on Him, not because
He stood in need of them, but because they would rest in Him, i.e.,
would find their accomplishment in Him, so that there would be no more
prophets in your nation after the ancient custom: and this fact you
plainly perceive. For after Him no prophet has arisen among you. Now,
that \[you may know that\] your prophets, each receiving some one or two
powers from God, did and spoke the things which we have learned from the
Scriptures, attend to the following remarks of mine. Solomon possessed
the spirit of wisdom, Daniel that of understanding and counsel, Moses
that of might and piety, Elijah that of fear, and Isaiah that of
knowledge; and so with the others: each possessed one power, or one
joined alternately with another; also Jeremiah, and the twelve
\[prophets\], and David, and, in short, the rest who existed amongst
you. Accordingly He <span id="fr_2292"></span>[2293](#fn_2292) rested,
i.e., ceased, when *He* came, after whom, in the times of this
dispensation wrought out by Him amongst men, <span
id="fr_2293"></span>[2294](#fn_2293) it was requisite that such gifts
should cease from you; and having received their rest in Him, should
again, as had been predicted, become gifts which, from the grace of His
Spirit’s power, He imparts to those who believe in Him, according as He
deems each man worthy thereof. I have already said, and do again say,
that it had been prophesied that this would be done by Him after His
ascension to heaven. It is accordingly said, <span
id="fr_2294"></span>[2295](#fn_2294) ‘He ascended on high, He led
captivity captive, He gave gifts unto the sons of men.’ And again, in
another prophecy it is said: ‘And it shall come to pass after this, I
will pour out My Spirit on all flesh, and on My servants, and on My
handmaids, and they shall prophesy.’ <span
id="fr_2295"></span>[2296](#fn_2295)
