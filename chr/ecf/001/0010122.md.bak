## <span id="v.i-p0.1"></span>Introductory Note to the Epistles of Ignatius

<span id="v.i-p1"></span><span id="v.i-p1.1"></span>\[<span
class="upper"><span id="v.i-p1.2"></span>a.d.</span> 30–107.\] <span
class="upper"><span id="v.i-p1.3"></span>The</span> seductive myth which
represents this Father as the little child whom the Lord placed in the
midst of his apostles (St. [Matt. xviii.
2](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#002)<span id="v.i-p1.4"></span>.md)
indicates at least the period when he may be supposed to have been born.
That he and Polycarp were fellow-disciples under St. John, is a
tradition by no means inconsistent with anything in the Epistles of
either. His subsequent history is sufficiently indicated in the Epistles
which follow.

<span id="v.i-p2"></span>Had not the plan of this series been so
exclusively that of a mere revised reprint, the writings of Ignatius
themselves would have made me diffident as to the undertaking. It seems
impossible for any one to write upon the subject of these precious
remains, without provoking controversy. This publication is designed as
an *Eirenicon*, and hence “few words are best,” from one who might be
supposed incapable of an unbiased opinion on most of the points which
have been raised in connection with these Epistles. I must content
myself therefore, by referring the studious reader to the originals as
edited by Bishop Jacobson, with a Latin version and copious annotations.
That revered and learned divine honoured me with his friendship; and his
precious edition has been my frequent study, with theological students,
almost ever since it appeared in 1840. It is by no means superannuated
by the vigorous Ignatian literature which has since sprung up, and to
which reference will he made elsewhere. But I am content to leave the
whole matter, without comment, to the minds of Christians of whatever
school and to their independent conclusions. It is a great thing to
present them in a single volume with the shorter and longer Epistles
duly compared, and with the Curetonian version besides. One luxury only
I may claim, to relieve the drudging task-work of a mere reviser. Surely
I may point out some of the proverbial wisdom of this great disciple,
which has often stirred my soul, as with the trumpet heard by St. John
in Patmos. In him, indeed, the lions encountered a lion, one truly
begotten of “the Lion of the tribe of Judah.” Take, then, as a specimen,
these thrilling injunctions from his letter to Polycarp, to whom he
bequeathed his own spirit, and in whom he well knew the Church would
recognize a sort of survival of St. John himself. If the reader has any
true perception of the rhythm and force of the Greek language, let him
learn by heart the originals of the following aphorisms:—

Find time to pray without ceasing.

Every wound is not healed with the same remedy.

The times demand thee, as pilots the haven.

The crown is immortality. <span id="fr_480"></span>[481](#fn_480.md)

Stand like a beaten anvil. <span id="fr_481"></span>[482](#fn_481.md)

It is the part of a good athlete to be bruised and to prevail. <span
id="page_46">p. 46</span> <span id="v.i-Page_46"></span>

Consider the times: look for Him who is above time.

Slight not the menservants and the handmaids.

Let your stewardship define your work.

A Christian is not his own master, but waits upon God.

<span id="v.i-p5"></span>Ignatius so delighted in his name Theophorus
(sufficiently expounded in his own words to Trajan or his official
representative), that it is worth noting how deeply the early Christians
felt and believed in ([2 Cor. vi.
16](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#016)<span id="v.i-p5.1"></span>.md) the
indwelling Spirit.

<span id="v.i-p6"></span>Ignatius has been censured for his language to
the Romans, in which he seems to crave martyrdom. But he was already
condemned, in law a dead man, and felt himself at liberty to glory in
his tribulations. Is it more than modern Christians often too lightly
sing? —

> <span id="v.i-p6.1"></span>“Let cares like a wild deluge come,  
> And storms of sorrow fall,” etc.  

<span id="v.i-p7"></span>So the holy martyr adds, “Only let me attain
unto Jesus Christ.”

<span id="v.i-p8"></span>The Epistle to the Romans is utterly
inconsistent with any conception on his part, that Rome was the see and
residence of a bishop holding any other than fraternal relations with
himself. It is very noteworthy that it is devoid of expressions,
elsewhere made emphatic, <span id="fr_482"></span>[483](#fn_482.md) which
would have been much insisted upon had they been found herein. Think
what use would have been made of it, had the words which he addresses to
the Smyrnæans (chap. viii.) to strengthen their fidelity to Polycarp,
been found in this letter to the Romans, especially as in this letter we
first find the use of the phrase “Catholic Church” in patristic
writings. He defines it as to be found “where Jesus Christ is,” words
which certainly do not limit it to communion with a professed successor
of St. Peter.

<span id="v.i-p10"></span>The following is the original <span
class="upper"><span id="v.i-p10.1"></span>Introductory Notice</span>:—

<span id="v.i-p11"></span><span class="upper"><span
id="v.i-p11.1"></span>The</span> epistles ascribed to Ignatius have
given rise to more controversy than any other documents connected with
the primitive Church. As is evident to every reader on the very first
glance at these writings, they contain numerous statements which bear on
points of ecclesiastical order that have long divided the Christian
world; and a strong temptation has thus been felt to allow some amount
of prepossession to enter into the discussion of their authenticity or
spuriousness. At the same time, this question has furnished a noble
field for the display of learning and acuteness, and has, in the various
forms under which it has been debated, given rise to not a few works of
the very highest ability and scholarship. We shall present such an
outline of the controversy as may enable the reader to understand its
position at the present day.

<span id="v.i-p12"></span>There are, in all, fifteen Epistles which bear
the name of Ignatius. These are the following: One to the Virgin Mary,
two to the Apostle John, one to Mary of Cassobelæ, one to the Tarsians,
one to the Antiochians, one to Hero, a deacon of Antioch, one to the
Philippians; one to the Ephesians, one to the Magnesians, one to the
Trallians, one to the Romans, one to the Philadelphians, one to the
Smyrnæans, and one to Polycarp. The first three exist only in Latin: all
the rest are extant also in Greek.

<span id="v.i-p13"></span>It is now the universal opinion of critics,
that the first eight of these professedly Ignatian letters are spurious.
They bear in themselves indubitable proofs of being the production of a
later age than that in which Ignatius lived. Neither Eusebius nor Jerome
makes the least reference to them; and they are now by common consent
set aside as forgeries, which were at various dates, and to serve
special purposes, put forth under the name of the celebrated Bishop of
Antioch.

<span id="v.i-p14"></span>But after the question has been thus
simplified, it still remains sufficiently complex. Of the seven Epistles
which are acknowledged by Eusebius (*Hist. Eccl.*, iii. 36), we possess
two Greek recensions, a shorter and a longer. It is plain that one or
other of these exhibits a corrupt text, and <span id="page_47">p.
47</span> <span id="v.i-Page_47"></span> scholars have for the most part
agreed to accept the shorter form as representing the genuine letters of
Ignatius. This was the opinion generally acquiesced in, from the time
when critical editions of these Epistles began to be issued, down to our
own day. Criticism, indeed, fluctuated a good deal as to which Epistles
should be accepted and which rejected. Archp. Usher (1644), Isaac
Vossius (1646), J. B. Cotelerius (1672), Dr. T. Smith (I709), and
others, edited the writings ascribed to Ignatius in forms differing very
considerably as to the order in which they were arranged, and the degree
of authority assigned them, until at length, from about the beginning of
the eighteenth century, the seven Greek Epistles, of which a translation
is here given, came to be generally accepted in their *shorter* form as
the genuine writings of Ignatius.

<span id="v.i-p15"></span>Before this date, however, there had not been
wanting some who refused to acknowledge the authenticity of these
Epistles in either of the recensions in which they were then known to
exist. By far the most learned and elaborate work maintaining this
position was that of Daillé (or Dallæus), published in 1666. This drew
forth in reply the celebrated *Vindiciæ* of Bishop Pearson, which
appeared in 1672. It was generally supposed that this latter work had
established on an immoveable foundation the genuineness of the shorter
form of the Ignatian Epistles; and, as we have stated above, this was
the conclusion almost universally accepted down to our own day. The only
considerable exception to this concurrence was presented by Whiston, who
laboured to maintain in his *Primitive Christianity Revived* (1711) the
superior claims of the longer recension of the Epistles, apparently
influenced in doing so by the support which he thought they furnished to
the kind of Arianism which he had adopted.

<span id="v.i-p16"></span>But although the shorter form of the Ignatian
letters had been generally accepted in preference to the longer, there
was still a pretty prevalent opinion among scholars, that even it could
not be regarded as absolutely free from interpolations, or as of
undoubted authenticity. Thus said Lardner, in his *Credibility of the
Gospel History* (1743): “have carefully compared the two editions, and
am very well satisfied, upon that comparison, that the larger are an
interpolation of the smaller, and not the smaller an epitome or
abridgment of the larger. … But whether the smaller themselves are the
genuine writings of Ignatius, Bishop of Antioch, is a question that has
been much disputed, and has employed the pens of the ablest critics. And
whatever positiveness some may have shown on either side, I must own I
have found it a very difficult question.”

<span id="v.i-p17"></span>This expression of uncertainty was repeated in
substance by Jortin (1751), Mosheim (1755), Griesbach (1768),
Rosenmüller (1795), Neander (1826), and many others; some going so far
as to deny that we have any authentic remains of Ignatius at all, while
others, though admitting the seven shorter letters as being probably
his, yet strongly suspected that they were not free from interpolation.
Upon the whole, however, the shorter recension was, until recently,
accepted without much opposition, and chiefly in dependence on the work
of Bishop Pearson above mentioned, as exhibiting the genuine form of the
Epistles of Ignatius.

<span id="v.i-p18"></span>But a totally different aspect was given to
the question by the discovery of a Syriac version of three of these
Epistles among the <span class="upper"><span
id="v.i-p18.1"></span>mss.</span> procured from the monastery of St.
Mary Deipara, in the desert of Nitria, in Egypt. In the years 1838,
1839, and again in 1842, Archdeacon Tattam visited that monastery, and
succeeded in obtaining for the English Government a vast number of
ancient Syriac manuscripts. On these being deposited in the British
Museum, <span id="page_48">p. 48</span> <span id="v.i-Page_48"></span>
the late Dr. Cureton, who then had charge of the Syriac department,
discovered among them, first, the Epistle to Polycarp, and then again,
the same Epistle, with those to the Ephesians and to the Romans, in two
other volumes of manuscripts.

<span id="v.i-p19"></span>As the result of this discovery, Cureton
published in 1845 a work, entitled, *The Ancient Syriac Version of the
Epistles of St. Ignatius to Polycarp, the Ephesian, and the Romans*,
etc., in which he argued that these Epistles represented more accurately
than any formerly published what Ignatius had actually written. This, of
course, opened up the controversy afresh. While some accepted the views
of Cureton, others very strenuously opposed them. Among the former was
the late Chev. Bunsen; among the latter, an anonymous writer in the
*English Review*, and Dr. Hefele, in his third edition of the *Apostolic
Fathers*. In reply to those who had controverted his arguments, Cureton
published his *Vindiciæ Ignatianæ* in 1846, and his *Corpus Ignatianum*
in 1849. He begins his introduction to the last-named work with the
following sentences: “Exactly three centuries and a half intervened
between the time when three Epistles in Latin, attributed to St.
Ignatius, first issued from the press, and the publication in 1845 of
three letters in Syriac bearing the name of the same apostolic writer.
Very few years passed before the former were almost universally regarded
as false and spurious; and it seems not improbable that scarcely a
longer period will elapse before the latter be almost as generally
acknowledged and received as the only true and genuine letters of the
venerable Bishop of Antioch that have either come down to our times, or
were ever known in the earliest ages of the Christian Church.”

<span id="v.i-p20"></span>Had the somewhat sanguine hope thus expressed
been realized, it would have been unnecessary for us to present to the
English reader more than a translation of these three Syriac Epistles.
But the Ignatian controversy is not yet settled. There are still those
who hold that the balance of argument is in favour of the shorter Greek,
as against these Syriac Epistles. They regard the latter as an epitome
of the former, and think the harshness which, according to them, exists
in the sequence of thoughts and sentences, clearly shows that this is
the case. We have therefore given all the forms of the Ignatian letters
which have the least claim on our attention. <span
id="fr_483"></span>[484](#fn_483.md) The reader may judge, by comparison
for himself, which of these is to be accepted as genuine, supposing him
disposed to admit the claims of any one of them. We content ourselves
with laying the materials for judgment before him, and with referring to
the above-named works in which we find the whole subject discussed. As
to the personal history of Ignatius, almost nothing is known. The
principal source of information regarding him is found in the account of
his martyrdom, to which the reader is referred. Polycarp alludes to him
in his Epistle to the Philippians (chap. ix.), and also to his letters
(chap. xiii.). Irenæus quotes a passage from his Epistle to the Romans
(*Adv. Hær.*, v. 28; *Epist. ad Rom.*, chap. iv.), without, however,
naming him. Origen twice refers to him, first in the preface to his
Comm. on the Song of Solomon, where he quotes a passage from the Epistle
of Ignatius to the Romans, and again in his sixth homily on St. Luke,
where he quotes from the Epistle to the Ephesians, both times naming the
author. It is unnecessary to give later references.

<span id="v.i-p22"></span><span id="v.i-p22.1"></span><span
id="v.i-p22.2"></span>Supposing the letters of Ignatius and the account
of his martyrdom to be authentic, we learn from them that he voluntarily
presented himself before Trajan at Antioch, the seat of his bishopric,
when that prince was on his *first* expedition against the Parthians and
Armenians (<span class="upper"><span id="v.i-p22.3"></span>a.d.</span>
107); and on professing himself a Christian, was condemned to the wild
beasts. After a long and dangerous voyage he came to Smyrna, of which
Polycarp was bishop, and thence wrote his four Epistles to the
Ephesians, the Magnesians, the Trallians, and the Romans. From Smyrna he
came to Troas, and tarrying there a few days, he wrote to the
Philadelphians, the Smyrnæans, and Polycarp. He then came on to
Neapolis, and passed through the whole of Macedonia. Finding a ship at
Dyrrachium in Epirus about to sail into Italy, he embarked, and crossing
the Adriatic, was brought to Rome, where he perished on the 20th of
December 107, or, as some think, who deny a twofold expedition of Trajan
against the Parthians, on the same day of the year <span
class="upper"><span id="v.i-p22.4"></span>a.d.</span> 116.
