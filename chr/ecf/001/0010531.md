<span id="viii.iv.lxx"></span>

### <span id="viii.iv.lxx-p0.1"></span>Chapter LXX.—So also the mysteries of Mithras are distorted from the prophecies of Daniel and Isaiah.

<span id="viii.iv.lxx-p1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.lxx-p1.1"></span><span id="viii.iv.lxx-p1.2"></span>“And
when those who record the mysteries of Mithras say that he was begotten
of a rock, and call the place where those who believe in him are
initiated a cave, do I not perceive here that the utterance of Daniel,
that a stone without <span id="page_234">p. 234</span> <span
id="viii.iv.lxx-Page_234"></span> hands was cut out of a great mountain,
has been imitated by them, and that they have attempted likewise to
imitate the whole of Isaiah’s <span id="fr_2209"></span>[2210](#fn_2209.md)
words? <span id="fr_2210"></span>[2211](#fn_2210.md) For they <span
id="fr_2211"></span>[2212](#fn_2211.md) contrived that the words of
righteousness be quoted also by them. <span
id="fr_2212"></span>[2213](#fn_2212.md) But I must repeat to you the words
of Isaiah referred to, in order that from them you may know that these
things are so. They are these: ‘Hear, ye that are far off, what I have
done; those that are near shall know my might. The sinners in Zion are
removed; trembling shall seize the impious. Who shall announce to you
the everlasting place? The man who walks in righteousness, speaks in the
right way, hates sin and unrighteousness, and keeps his hands pure from
bribes, stops the ears from hearing the unjust judgment of blood closes
the eyes from seeing unrighteousness: he shall dwell in the lofty cave
of the strong rock. Bread shall be given to him, and his water \[shall
be\] sure. Ye shall see the King with glory, and your eyes shall look
far off. Your soul shall pursue diligently the fear of the Lord. Where
is the scribe? where are the counsellors? where is he that numbers those
who are nourished,—the small and great people? with whom they did not
take counsel, nor knew the depth of the voices, so that they heard not.
The people who are become depreciated, and there is no understanding in
him who hears.’ <span id="fr_2213"></span>[2214](#fn_2213.md) Now it is
evident, that in this prophecy \[allusion is made\] to the bread which
our Christ gave us to eat, <span id="fr_2214"></span>[2215](#fn_2214.md) in
remembrance of His being made flesh for the sake of His believers, for
whom also He suffered; and to the cup which He gave us to drink, <span
id="fr_2215"></span>[2216](#fn_2215.md) in remembrance of His own blood,
with giving of thanks. And this prophecy proves that we shall behold
this very King with glory; and the very terms of the prophecy declare
loudly, that the people foreknown to believe in Him were foreknown to
pursue diligently the fear of the Lord. Moreover, these Scriptures are
equally explicit in saying, that those who are reputed to know the
writings of the Scriptures, and who hear the prophecies, have no
understanding. And when I hear, Trypho,” said I, “that Perseus was
begotten of a virgin, I understand that the deceiving serpent
counterfeited also this.

<span id="viii.iv.lxx-p3"></span> Justin says that the priests of
Mithras imitated all the words of Isaiah about to be quoted; and to
prove it, is content with a single example, namely, the precepts of
righteousness, which they were wont to relate to him, as in these words
of Isaiah: “He who walks in righteousness,” etc. Justin omitted many
other passages, as easy and obvious. For since Mithras is the same as
fire, it manifestly answers to the fire of which Isaiah speaks. And
since Justin reminded them who are initiated, that they are said to be
initiated by Mithras himself, it was not necessary to remind them that
the words of Isaiah are imitated in this: “You shall see the King with
glory.” Bread and water are referred to by Isaiah: so also in these
mysteries of Mithras, Justin testifies that bread and a cup of water are
placed before them (Apol. i.).—<span class="upper"><span
