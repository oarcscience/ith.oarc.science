### <span id="viii.iv.xxvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXVII.—Why God taught the same things by the prophets as by Moses.

<span id="viii.iv.xxvii-p1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.xxvii-p1.1"></span>And Trypho said, “Why do you select and
quote whatever you wish from the prophetic writings, but do not refer to
those which expressly command the Sabbath to be observed? For Isaiah
thus speaks: ‘If thou shalt turn away thy foot from the Sabbaths, so as
not to do thy pleasure on the holy day, and shalt call the Sabbaths the
holy delights of thy God; if thou shalt not lift thy foot to work, and
shalt not speak a word from thine own mouth; then thou shalt trust in
the Lord, and He shall cause thee to go up to the good things of the
land; and He shall feed thee with the inheritance of Jacob thy father:
for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.’ ” <span
id="fr_2015"></span>[2016](#fn_2015.md)

<span id="viii.iv.xxvii-p3"></span>And I replied, “I have passed them
by, my friends, not because such prophecies were contrary to me, but
because you have understood, and <span id="page_208">p. 208</span> <span
id="viii.iv.xxvii-Page_208"></span> do understand, that although God
commands you by all the prophets to do the same things which He also
commanded by Moses, it was on account of the hardness of your hearts,
and your ingratitude towards Him, that He continually proclaims them, in
order that, even in this way, if you repented, you might please Him, and
neither sacrifice your children to demons, nor be partakers with
thieves, nor lovers of gifts, nor hunters after revenge, nor fail in
doing judgment for orphans, nor be inattentive to the justice due to the
widow nor have your hands full of blood. ‘For the daughters of Zion have
walked with a high neck, both sporting by winking with their eyes, and
sweeping along their dresses. <span id="fr_2016"></span>[2017](#fn_2016.md)
For they are all gone aside,’ He exclaims, ‘they are all become useless.
There is none that understands, there is not so much as one. With their
tongues they have practised deceit, their throat is an open sepulchre,
the poison of asps is under their lips, destruction and misery are in
their paths, and the way of peace they have not known.’ <span
id="fr_2017"></span>[2018](#fn_2017.md) So that, as in the beginning, these
things were enjoined you because of your wickedness, in like manner
because of your stedfastness in it, or rather your increased proneness
to it, by means of the same precepts He calls you to a remembrance or
knowledge of it. But you are a people hard-hearted and without
understanding, both blind and lame, children in whom is no faith, as He
Himself says, honouring Him only with your lips, far from Him in your
hearts, teaching doctrines that are your own and not His. For, tell me,
did God wish the priests to sin when they offer the sacrifices on the
Sabbaths? or those to sin, who are circumcised and do circumcise on the
Sabbaths; since He commands that on the eighth day—even though it happen
to be a Sabbath— those who are born shall be always circumcised? or
could not the infants be operated upon one day previous or one day
subsequent to the Sabbath, if He knew that it is a sinful act upon the
Sabbaths? Or why did He not teach those—who are called righteous and
pleasing to Him, who lived before Moses and Abraham, who were not
circumcised in their foreskin, and observed no Sabbaths—to keep these
institutions?”
