### <span id="ix.iv.xvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVI.—Proofs from the apostolic writings, that Jesus Christ was one and the same, the only begotten Son of God, perfect God and perfect man.

<span id="ix.iv.xvii-p1"></span>1. <span
id="ix.iv.xvii-p1.1"></span><span id="ix.iv.xvii-p1.2"></span><span
id="ix.iv.xvii-p1.3"></span>But <span
id="fr_3568"></span>[3569](#fn_3568.md) there are some who say that Jesus
was merely a receptacle of Christ, upon whom the Christ, as a dove,
descended from above, and that when He had declared the unnameable
Father He entered into the Pleroma in an incomprehensible and invisible
manner: for that He was not comprehended, not only by men, but not even
by those powers and virtues which are in heaven, and that Jesus was the
Son, but that <span id="fr_3569"></span>[3570](#fn_3569.md) Christ was the
Father, and the Father of Christ, God; while others say that He merely
suffered in outward appearance, being naturally impassible. The
Valentinians, again, maintain that the dispensational Jesus was the same
who passed through Mary, upon whom that Saviour from the more exalted
\[region\] descended, who was also termed *Pan,* <span
id="fr_3570"></span>[3571](#fn_3570.md) because He possessed the names
(*vocabula*) of all those who had produced Him; but that \[this latter\]
shared with Him, the dispensational one, His power and His name; so that
by His means death was abolished, but the Father was made known by that
Saviour who had descended from above, whom they do also allege to be
Himself the receptacle of Christ and of the entire Pleroma; confessing,
indeed, in tongue one Christ Jesus, but being divided in \[actual\]
opinion: for, as I have already observed, it is the practice of these
men to say that there was one Christ, who was produced by Monogenes, for
the confirmation of the Pleroma; but that another, the Saviour, was sent
\[forth\] for the glorification of the Father; and yet another, the
dispensational one, and whom they represent as having suffered, who also
bore \[in himself\] Christ, that Saviour who returned into the Pleroma.
I judge it necessary therefore to take into account the entire mind of
the apostles regarding our Lord Jesus Christ, and to show that not only
did they never hold any such opinions regarding Him; but, still further,
that they announced through the Holy Spirit, that those who should teach
such doctrines were agents of Satan, sent forth for the purpose of
overturning the faith of some, and drawing them away from life.

<span id="ix.iv.xvii-p5"></span>2. That John knew the one and the same
Word of God, and that He was the only begotten, and that He became
incarnate for our salvation, Jesus Christ our Lord, I have sufficiently
proved from the word of John himself. And Matthew, too, recognising one
and the same Jesus Christ, exhibiting his generation as a man from the
Virgin, <span id="fr_3571"></span>[3572](#fn_3571.md) even as God did
promise David that He would raise up from the fruit of his body an
eternal King, having made the same promise to Abraham a long time
previously, says: “The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son
of David, the son of Abraham.” <span
id="fr_3572"></span>[3573](#fn_3572.md) Then, that he might free our mind
from suspicion regarding Joseph, he says: “But the birth of Christ <span
id="fr_3573"></span>[3574](#fn_3573.md) was on this <span id="page_441">p.
441</span> <span id="ix.iv.xvii-Page_441"></span> wise. When His mother
was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with
child of the Holy Ghost.” Then, when Joseph had it in contemplation to
put Mary away, since she proved with child, \[Matthew tells us of\] the
angel of God standing by him, and saying: “Fear not to take unto thee
Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.
And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call His name Jesus; for
He shall save His people from their sins. Now this was done, that it
might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet: Behold,
a virgin shall conceive, and bring forth a son, and they shall call His
name Emmanuel, which is, God with us;” clearly signifying that both the
promise made to the fathers had been accomplished, that the Son of God
was born of a virgin, and that He Himself was Christ the Saviour whom
the prophets had foretold; not, as these men assert, that Jesus was He
who was born of Mary, but that Christ was He who descended from above.
Matthew might certainly have said, “Now the birth of *Jesus* was on this
wise;” but the Holy Ghost, foreseeing the corrupters \[of the truth\],
and guarding by anticipation against their deceit, says by Matthew, “But
the birth of *Christ* was on this wise;” and that He is Emmanuel, lest
perchance we might consider Him as a mere man: for “not by the will of
the flesh nor by the will of man, but by the will of God was the Word
made flesh;” <span id="fr_3574"></span>[3575](#fn_3574.md) and that we
should not imagine that Jesus was one, and Christ another, but should
know them to be one and the same.

<span id="ix.iv.xvii-p10"></span>3. Paul, when writing to the Romans,
has explained this very point: “Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ,
predestinated unto the Gospel of God, which He had promised by His
prophets in the holy Scriptures, concerning His Son, who was made to Him
of the seed of David according to the flesh, who was predestinated the
Son of God with power through the Spirit of holiness, by the
resurrection from the dead of our Lord Jesus Christ.” <span
id="fr_3575"></span>[3576](#fn_3575.md) And again, writing to the Romans
about Israel, he says: “Whose are the fathers, and from whom is Christ
according to the flesh, who is God over all, blessed for ever.” <span
id="fr_3576"></span>[3577](#fn_3576.md) And again, in his Epistle to the
Galatians, he says: “But when the fulness of time had come, God sent
forth His Son, made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that
were under the law, that we might receive the adoption;” <span
id="fr_3577"></span>[3578](#fn_3577.md) plainly indicating one God, who did
by the prophets make promise of the Son, and one Jesus Christ our Lord,
who was of the seed of David according to His birth from Mary; and that
Jesus Christ was appointed the Son of God with power, according to the
Spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead, as being the
first begotten in all the creation; <span
id="fr_3578"></span>[3579](#fn_3578.md) the Son of God being made the Son
of man, that through Him we may receive the adoption,—humanity <span
id="fr_3579"></span>[3580](#fn_3579.md) sustaining, and receiving, and
embracing the Son of God. Wherefore Mark also says: “The beginning of
the Gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God; as it is written in the
prophets.” <span id="fr_3580"></span>[3581](#fn_3580.md) Knowing one and
the same Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was announced by the prophets,
who from the fruit of David’s body was Emmanuel, “the messenger of great
counsel of the Father;” <span id="fr_3581"></span>[3582](#fn_3581.md)
through whom God caused the day-spring and the Just One to arise to the
house of David, and raised up for him an horn of salvation, “and
established a testimony in Jacob;” <span
id="fr_3582"></span>[3583](#fn_3582.md) as David says when discoursing on
the causes of His birth: “And He appointed a law in Israel, that another
generation might know \[Him,\] the children which should he born from
these, and they arising shall themselves declare to their children, so
that they might set their hope in God, and seek after His
commandments.” <span id="fr_3583"></span>[3584](#fn_3583.md) And again, the
angel said, when bringing good tidings to Mary: “He shall he great, and
shall be called the Son of the Highest; and the Lord shall give unto Him
the throne of His father David;” <span
id="fr_3584"></span>[3585](#fn_3584.md) acknowledging that He who is the
Son of the Highest, the same is Himself also the Son of David. And
David, knowing by the Spirit the dispensation of the advent of this
Person, by which He is supreme over all the living and dead, confessed
Him as Lord, sitting on the right hand of the Most High Father. <span
id="fr_3585"></span>[3586](#fn_3585.md)

<span id="ix.iv.xvii-p22"></span>4. <span
id="ix.iv.xvii-p22.1"></span>But Simeon also —he who had received an
intimation from the Holy Ghost that he should not see death, until first
he had beheld Christ Jesus— taking Him, the first-begotten of the
Virgin, into his hands, blessed God, and said, “Lord, now lettest Thou
Thy servant depart in peace, according to Thy word: because mine eyes
have seen Thy salvation, which Thou hast prepared before the face of all
people; a light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of Thy people
Israel;” <span id="fr_3586"></span>[3587](#fn_3586.md) confessing thus,
that the infant whom he was holding in his hands, Jesus, born of Mary,
was Christ Himself, the Son of God, the light of all, the glory of
Israel itself, <span id="page_442">p. 442</span> <span
id="ix.iv.xvii-Page_442"></span> and the peace and refreshing of those
who had fallen asleep. For He was already despoiling men, by removing
their ignorance, conferring upon them His own knowledge, and scattering
abroad those who recognised Him, as Esaias says: “Call His name, Quickly
spoil, Rapidly divide.” <span id="fr_3587"></span>[3588](#fn_3587.md) Now
these are the works of Christ. He therefore was Himself Christ, whom
Simeon carrying \[in his arms\] blessed the Most High; on beholding whom
the shepherds glorified God; whom John, while yet in his mother’s womb,
and He (Christ) in that of Mary, recognising as the Lord, saluted with
leaping; whom the Magi, when they had seen, adored, and offered their
gifts \[to Him\], as I have already stated, and prostrated themselves to
the eternal King, departed by another way, not now returning by the way
of the Assyrians. “For before the child shall have knowledge to cry,
Father or mother, He shall receive the power of Damascus, and the spoils
of Samaria, against the king of the Assyrians;” <span
id="fr_3588"></span>[3589](#fn_3588.md) declaring, in a mysterious manner
indeed, but emphatically, that the Lord did fight with a hidden hand
against Amalek. <span id="fr_3589"></span>[3590](#fn_3589.md) For this
cause, too, He suddenly removed those children belonging to the house of
David, whose happy lot it was to have been born at that time, that He
might send them on before into His kingdom; He, since He was Himself an
infant, so arranging it that human infants should be martyrs, slain,
according to the Scriptures, for the sake of Christ, who was born in
Bethlehem of Judah, in the city of David. <span
id="fr_3590"></span>[3591](#fn_3590.md)

<span id="ix.iv.xvii-p28"></span>5. Therefore did the Lord also say to
His disciples after the resurrection, “O thoughtless ones, and slow of
heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken! Ought not Christ to
have suffered these things, and to enter into His glory?” <span
id="fr_3591"></span>[3592](#fn_3591.md) And again does He say to them:
“These are the words which I spoke unto you while I was yet with you,
that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of
Moses, and in the prophets, and in the Psalms, concerning Me. Then
opened He their understanding, that they should understand the
Scriptures, and said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved
Christ to suffer, and to rise again from the dead, and that repentance
for the remission of sins be preached in His name among all
nations.” <span id="fr_3592"></span>[3593](#fn_3592.md) Now this is He who
was born of Mary; for He says: “The Son of man must suffer many things,
and be rejected, and crucified, and on the third day rise again.” <span
id="fr_3593"></span>[3594](#fn_3593.md) The Gospel, therefore, knew no
other son of man but Him who was of Mary, who also suffered; and no
Christ who flew away from Jesus before the passion; but Him who was born
it knew as Jesus Christ the Son of God, and that this same suffered and
rose again, as John, the disciple of the Lord, verifies, saying: “But
these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the
Son of God, and that believing ye might have eternal life in His
name,” <span id="fr_3594"></span>[3595](#fn_3594.md) —foreseeing these
blasphemous systems which divide the Lord, as far as lies in their
power, saying that He was formed of two different substances. For this
reason also he has thus testified to us in his Epistle: “Little
children, it is the last time; and as ye have heard that Antichrist doth
come, now have many antichrists appeared; whereby we know that it is the
last time. They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they
had been of us, they would have continued with us: but \[they
departed\], that they might be made manifest that they are not of us.
Know ye therefore, that every lie is from without, and is not of the
truth. Who is a liar, but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? This
is Antichrist.” <span id="fr_3595"></span>[3596](#fn_3595.md)

<span id="ix.iv.xvii-p34"></span>6. But inasmuch as all those before
mentioned, although they certainly do with their tongue confess one
Jesus Christ, make fools of themselves, thinking one thing and saying
another; <span id="fr_3596"></span>[3597](#fn_3596.md) for their hypotheses
vary, as I have already shown, alleging, \[as they do,\] that one Being
suffered and was born, and that this was Jesus; but that there was
another who descended upon Him, and that this was Christ, who also
ascended again; and they argue, that he who proceeded from the Demiurge,
or he who was dispensational, or he who sprang from Joseph, was the
Being subject to suffering; but upon the latter there descended from the
invisible and ineffable \[places\] the former, whom they assert to be
incomprehensible, invisible, and impassible: they thus wander from the
truth, because their doctrine departs from Him who is truly God, being
ignorant that His only-begotten Word, who is always present with the
human race, united to and mingled with His own creation, according to
the Father’s pleasure, and who became flesh, is Himself Jesus Christ our
Lord, who did also suffer for us, and rose again on our behalf, and who
will come again in the glory of His Father, to raise up all flesh, and
for the manifestation of salvation, and to apply the rule of just
judgment to all who were made by Him. There is therefore, as I have
pointed out, one God the Father, and one Christ Jesus, who came by means
of the whole dispensational arrangements \[connected with Him\], and
gathered <span id="page_443">p. 443</span> <span
id="ix.iv.xvii-Page_443"></span> together all things in Himself. <span
id="fr_3597"></span>[3598](#fn_3597.md) But in every respect, too, He is
man, the formation of God; and thus He took up man into Himself, the
invisible becoming visible, the incomprehensible being made
comprehensible, the impassible becoming capable of suffering, and the
Word being made man, thus summing up all things in Himself: so that as
in super-celestial, spiritual, and invisible things, the Word of God is
supreme, so also in things visible and corporeal He might possess the
supremacy, and, taking to Himself the pre-eminence, as well as
constituting Himself Head of the Church, He might draw all things to
Himself at the proper time.

<span id="ix.iv.xvii-p37"></span>7. <span
id="ix.iv.xvii-p37.1"></span>With Him is nothing incomplete or out of
due season, just as with the Father there is nothing incongruous. For
all these things were foreknown by the Father; but the Son works them
out at the proper time in perfect order and sequence. <span
id="ix.iv.xvii-p37.2"></span>This was the reason why, when Mary was
urging \[Him\] on to \[perform\] the wonderful miracle of the wine, and
was desirous before the time to partake <span
id="fr_3598"></span>[3599](#fn_3598.md) of the cup of emblematic
significance, the Lord, checking her untimely haste, said, “Woman, what
have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come” <span
id="fr_3599"></span>[3600](#fn_3599.md) — waiting for that hour which was
foreknown by the Father. This is also the reason why, when men were
often desirous to take Him, it is said, “No man laid hands upon Him, for
the hour of His being taken was not yet come;” <span
id="fr_3600"></span>[3601](#fn_3600.md) nor the time of His passion, which
had been foreknown by the Father; as also says the prophet Habakkuk, “By
this Thou shalt be known when the years have drawn nigh; Thou shalt be
set forth when the time comes; because my soul is disturbed by anger,
Thou shalt remember Thy mercy.” <span
id="fr_3601"></span>[3602](#fn_3601.md) Paul also says: “But when the
fulness of time came, God sent forth His Son.” <span
id="fr_3602"></span>[3603](#fn_3602.md) By which is made manifest, that all
things which had been foreknown of the Father, our Lord did accomplish
in their order, season, and hour, foreknown and fitting, being indeed
one and the same, but rich and great. For He fulfils the bountiful and
comprehensive will of His Father, inasmuch as He is Himself the Saviour
of those who are saved, and the Lord of those who are under authority,
and the God of all those things which have been formed, the
only-begotten of the Father, Christ who was announced, and the Word of
God, who became incarnate when the fulness of time had come, at which
the Son of God had to become the Son of man.

<span id="ix.iv.xvii-p43"></span>8. All, therefore, are outside of the
\[Christian\] dispensation, who, under pretext of knowledge, understand
that Jesus was one, and Christ another, and the Only-begotten another,
from whom again is the Word, and that the Saviour is another, whom these
disciples of error allege to be a production of those who were made Æons
in a state of degeneracy. Such men are to outward appearance sheep; for
they appear to be like us, by what they say in public, repeating the
same words as we do; but inwardly they are wolves. Their doctrine is
homicidal, conjuring up, as it does, a number of gods, and simulating
many Fathers, but lowering and dividing the Son of God in many ways.
These are they against whom the Lord has cautioned us beforehand; and
His disciple, in his Epistle already mentioned, commands us to avoid
them, when he says: “For many deceivers are entered into the world, who
confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver
and an antichrist. Take heed to them, that ye lose not what ye have
wrought.” <span id="fr_3603"></span>[3604](#fn_3603.md) And again does he
say in the Epistle: “Many false prophets are gone out into the world.
Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that
Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God; and every spirit which
separates Jesus Christ is not of God, but is of antichrist.” <span
id="fr_3604"></span>[3605](#fn_3604.md) These words agree with what was
said in the Gospel, that “the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us.”
Wherefore he again exclaims in his Epistle, “Every one that believeth
that Jesus is the Christ, has been born of God;” <span
id="fr_3605"></span>[3606](#fn_3605.md) knowing Jesus Christ to be one and
the same, to whom the gates of heaven were opened, because of His taking
upon Him flesh: who shall also come in the same flesh in which He
suffered, revealing the glory of the Father.

<span id="ix.iv.xvii-p47"></span>9. Concurring with these statements,
Paul, speaking to the Romans, declares: “Much more they who receive
abundance of grace and righteousness for \[eternal\] life, shall reign
by one, Christ Jesus.” <span id="fr_3606"></span>[3607](#fn_3606.md) It
follows from this, that he knew nothing of that Christ who flew away
from Jesus; nor did he of the Saviour above, whom they hold to be
impassible. For if, in <span id="page_444">p. 444</span> <span
id="ix.iv.xvii-Page_444"></span> truth, the one suffered, and the other
remained incapable of suffering, and the one was born, but the other
descended upon him who was born, and left him again, it is not one, but
two, that are shown forth. But that the apostle did know Him as one,
both who was born and who suffered, namely Christ Jesus, he again says
in the same Epistle: “Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized
in Christ Jesus were baptized in His death? that like as Christ rose
from the dead, so should we also walk in newness of life.” <span
id="fr_3607"></span>[3608](#fn_3607.md) But again, showing that Christ did
suffer, and was Himself the Son of God, who died for us, and redeemed us
with His blood at the time appointed beforehand, he says: “For how is
it, that Christ, when we were yet without strength, in due time died for
the ungodly? But God commendeth His love towards us, in that, while we
were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Much more, then, being now
justified by His blood, we shall be saved from wrath through Him. For
if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of His
Son; much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by His life.” <span
id="fr_3608"></span>[3609](#fn_3608.md) He declares in the plainest manner,
that the same Being who was laid hold of, and underwent suffering, and
shed His blood for us, was both Christ and the Son of God, who did also
rise again, and was taken up into heaven, as he himself \[Paul\] says:
“But at the same time, \[it, is\] Christ \[that\] died, yea rather, that
is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God.” <span
id="fr_3609"></span>[3610](#fn_3609.md) And again, “Knowing that Christ,
rising from the dead, dieth no more:” <span
id="fr_3610"></span>[3611](#fn_3610.md) for, as himself foreseeing, through
the Spirit, the subdivisions of evil teachers \[with regard to the
Lord’s person\], and being desirous of cutting away from them all
occasion of cavil, he says what has been already stated, \[and also
declares:\] “But if the Spirit of Him that raised up Jesus from the dead
dwell in you, He that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken
your mortal bodies.” <span id="fr_3611"></span>[3612](#fn_3611.md) This he
does not utter to those alone who wish to hear: Do not err, \[he says to
all:\] Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is one and the same, who did by
suffering reconcile us to God, and rose from the dead; who is at the
right hand of the Father, and perfect in all things; “who, when He was
buffeted, struck not in return; who, when He suffered, threatened
not;” <span id="fr_3612"></span>[3613](#fn_3612.md) and when He underwent
tyranny, He prayed His Father that He would forgive those who had
crucified Him. For He did Himself truly bring in salvation: since He is
Himself the Word of God, Himself the Only-begotten of the Father, Christ
Jesus our Lord.

Syriac <span class="upper"><span

several consecutive words in the old Latin version, and clear up the

as it probably is elsewhere, merely a contraction for “aut eum.”

Irenæus seems to have read <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iv.xvii-p44.2"></span>αὐτούς</span> instead of <span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.iv.xvii-p44.3"></span>ἑαυτούς</span>, as in
the received text.

[2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#002.md)<span id="ix.iv.xvii-p45.1"></span>.
This is a material difference from the received text of the passage:
“Every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the
flesh.” The Vulgate translation and Origen agree with Irenæus, and
Tertullian seems to recognise both readings (*Adv. Marc.*, v. 16).
Socrates tells us (vii. 32, p. 381) that the passage had been corrupted
by those who wished to separate the humanity of Christ from His
divinity, and that the old copies read, <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.iv.xvii-p45.2"></span>πᾶν πνεῦμα ὃ λύει τὸν ᾽Ιησοῦν ἀπὸ τοῦ Θεοῦ
οὐκ ἔστι</span>, which exactly agrees with Origen’s quotation, and very
nearly with that of Irenæus, now before us. Polycarp (*Ep.*, c. vii.)
seems to allude to the passage as we have it now, and so does Ignatius
(*Ep. Smyr.*, c. v.). See the question discussed by Burton, in his
*Ante-Nicene Testimonies* \[*to the Div. of Christ*. Another work of
Burton has a similar name. See British Critic, vol. ii. (of 1827), p.
265\].
