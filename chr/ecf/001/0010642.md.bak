### <span id="viii.vi.xxxii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXII.—Plato’s doctrine of the heavenly gift.

<span id="viii.vi.xxxii-p1"></span><span
id="viii.vi.xxxii-p1.1"></span>And if any one will attentively consider
the gift that descends from God on the holy men, —which gift the sacred
prophets call the Holy Ghost,—he shall find that this was announced
under another name by Plato in the dialogue with Meno. For, fearing to
name the gift of God “the Holy Ghost,” lest he should seem, by following
the teaching of the prophets, to be an enemy to the Greeks, he
acknowledges, indeed, that it comes down from God, yet does not think
fit to name it the Holy Ghost, but virtue. <span id="page_287">p.
287</span> <span id="viii.vi.xxxii-Page_287"></span> For so in the
dialogue with Meno, concerning reminiscence, after he had put many
questions regarding virtue, whether it could be taught or whether it
could not be taught, but must be gained by practice, or whether it could
be attained neither by practice nor by learning, but was a natural gift
in men, or whether it comes in some other way, he makes this declaration
in these very words: “But if now through this whole dialogue we have
conducted our inquiry and discussion aright, virtue must be neither a
natural gift, nor what one can receive by teaching, but comes to those
to whom it does come by divine destiny.” These things, I think, Plato
having learned from the prophets regarding the Holy Ghost, he has
manifestly transferred to what he calls virtue. For as the sacred
prophets say that one and the same spirit is divided into seven spirits,
so he also, naming it one and the same virtue, says this is divided into
four virtues; wishing by all means to avoid mention of the Holy Spirit,
but clearly declaring in a kind of allegory what the prophets said of
the Holy Spirit. For to this effect he spoke in the dialogue with Meno
towards the close: “From this reasoning, Meno, it appears that virtue
comes to those to whom it does come by a divine destiny. But we shall
know clearly about this, in what kind of way virtue comes to men, when,
as a first step, we shall have set ourselves to investigate, as an
independent inquiry, what virtue itself is.” You see how he calls only
by the name of virtue, the gift that descends from above; and yet he
counts it worthy of inquiry, whether it is right that this \[gift\] be
called virtue or some other thing, fearing to name it openly the Holy
Spirit, lest he should seem to be following the teaching of the
prophets.
