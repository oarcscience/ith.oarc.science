### <span id="v.xviii.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.—Expressions of respect for Ignatius.

<span id="v.xviii.vi-p1"></span>But time would fail me if I should
endeavour to enumerate <span id="fr_1372"></span>[1373](#fn_1372.md) all
those that pleased God in their youth, having been entrusted by God with
either the prophetical, the priestly, or the kingly office. And those
which have been mentioned may suffice, by way of bringing the subject to
thy remembrance. But I entreat thee not to reckon me presumptuous or
ostentatious \[in writing as I have done\]. For I have set forth these
statements, not as instructing thee, but simply as suggesting the matter
to the remembrance of my father in God. For I know my own place, <span
id="fr_1373"></span>[1374](#fn_1373.md) and do not compare myself with such
as you. I salute thy holy clergy, and thy Christ-loving people who are
ruled under thy care as their pastor. All the faithful with us salute
thee. Pray, blessed shepherd, that I may be in health as respects God.
