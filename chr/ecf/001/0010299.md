### <span id="v.xvii.xi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XI.—Continuation: audacity of Satan.

<span id="v.xvii.xi-p1"></span><span id="v.xvii.xi-p1.1"></span>If,
therefore, thou art trodden down under the feet of the Lord, how dost
thou tempt Him that cannot be tempted, forgetting that precept of the
lawgiver, “Thou shall not tempt the Lord thy God?” <span
id="fr_1345"></span>[1346](#fn_1345.md) Yea, thou even darest, most
accursed one, to appropriate the works of God to thyself, and to declare
that the dominion over these was delivered to thee. <span
id="fr_1346"></span>[1347](#fn_1346.md) And thou dost set forth thine own
fall as an example to the Lord, and dost promise to give Him what is
really His own, if He would fall down and worship thee. <span
id="fr_1347"></span>[1348](#fn_1347.md) And how didst thou not shudder, O
thou spirit more wicked through thy malevolence than all other wicked
spirits, to utter such words against the Lord? Through thine
appetite <span id="fr_1348"></span>[1349](#fn_1348.md) wast thou overcome,
and through thy vainglory wast thou brought to dishonour: through
avarice and ambition dost thou \[now\] draw on \[others\] to
ungodliness. Thou, O Belial, dragon, apostate, crooked serpent, rebel
against God, outcast from Christ, alien from the Holy Spirit, exile from
the ranks of the angels, reviler of the laws of God, enemy of all that
is lawful, who didst rise up against the first-formed of men, and didst
drive forth \[from obedience to\] the commandment \[of God\] those who
had in no respect injured thee; thou who didst raise up against Abel the
murderous Cain; thou who didst take arms against Job: dost thou say to
the Lord, “If Thou wilt fall down and worship me?” Oh what audacity! Oh
what madness! Thou runaway slave, thou incorrigible <span
id="fr_1349"></span>[1350](#fn_1349.md) slave, dost thou rebel against the
good Lord? Dost thou say to so great a Lord, the God of all that either
the mind or the senses can perceive, “If Thou wilt fall down and worship
me?”
