### <span id="v.viii.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.—The duties of husbands and wives.

<span id="v.viii.v-p1"></span><span id="v.viii.v-p1.1"></span>Flee evil
arts; but all the more discourse in public regarding them. <span
id="fr_1090"></span>[1091](#fn_1090.md) <span
id="v.viii.v-p2.2"></span>Speak to my sisters, that they love the Lord,
and be satisfied with their husbands both in the flesh and spirit. <span
id="v.viii.v-p2.3"></span>In like manner also, exhort my brethren, in
the name of Jesus Christ, that they love their wives, even as the Lord
the Church. <span id="fr_1091"></span>[1092](#fn_1091.md) <span
id="v.viii.v-p3.2"></span>If any one can continue in a state of
purity, <span id="fr_1092"></span>[1093](#fn_1092.md) to the honour of Him
who is Lord of the flesh, <span id="fr_1093"></span>[1094](#fn_1093.md) let
him so remain without boasting. If he begins to boast, he is undone; and
if he reckon himself greater than the bishop, he is ruined. <span
id="v.viii.v-p5.1"></span>But it becomes both men and women who marry,
to form their union with the approval of the bishop, that their marriage
may be according to God, and not after their own lust. Let all things be
done to the honour of God. <span id="fr_1094"></span>[1095](#fn_1094.md)

<span id="v.viii.v-p7"></span><span id="v.viii.v-p7.1"></span>Flee evil
arts; but all the more discourse in public regarding them. <span
id="v.viii.v-p7.2"></span>Speak to my sisters, that they love the Lord,
and be satisfied with their husbands both in the flesh and spirit. <span
id="v.viii.v-p7.3"></span>In like manner also, exhort my brethren, in
the name of Jesus Christ, that they love their wives, even as the Lord
the Church. <span id="v.viii.v-p7.4"></span>If any one can continue in a
state of purity, <span id="fr_1095"></span>[1096](#fn_1095.md) to the
honour of the flesh of the Lord, let him so remain without boasting. If
he shall boast, he is undone; and if he seeks to be more prominent <span
id="fr_1096"></span>[1097](#fn_1096.md) than the bishop, he is ruined.
<span id="v.viii.v-p9.1"></span>But it becomes both men and women who
marry, to form their union with the approval of the bishop, that their
marriage may be according to the Lord, and not after their own lust. Let
all things be done to the honour of God. <span
