### <span id="viii.ii.lxi-p0.1"></span>Chapter LXI.—Christian baptism.

<span id="viii.ii.lxi-p1"></span><span id="viii.ii.lxi-p1.1"></span>I
will also relate the manner in which we dedicated ourselves to God when
we had been made new through Christ; lest, if we omit this, we seem to
be unfair in the explanation we are making. As many as are persuaded and
believe that what we teach and say is true, and undertake to be able to
live accordingly, are instructed to pray and to entreat God with
fasting, for the remission of their sins that are past, we praying and
fasting with them. Then they are brought by us where there is water, and
are regenerated in the same manner in which we were ourselves
regenerated. For, in the name of God, the Father and Lord of the
universe, and of our Saviour Jesus Christ, and of the Holy Spirit, they
then receive the washing with water. For Christ also said, “Except ye be
born again, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.” <span
id="fr_1893"></span>[1894](#fn_1893.md) Now, that it is impossible for
those who have once been born to enter into their mothers’ wombs, is
manifest to all. And how those who have sinned and repent shall escape
their sins, is declared by Esaias the prophet, as I wrote above; <span
id="fr_1894"></span>[1895](#fn_1894.md) he thus speaks: “Wash you, make you
clean; put away the evil of your doings from your souls; learn to do
well; judge the fatherless, and plead for the widow: and come and let us
reason together, saith the Lord. And though your sins be as scarlet, I
will make them white like wool; and though they be as crimson, I will
make them white as snow. But if ye refuse and rebel, the sword shall
devour you: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.” <span
id="fr_1895"></span>[1896](#fn_1895.md)

<span id="viii.ii.lxi-p5"></span>And for this \[rite\] we have learned
from the apostles this reason. Since at our birth we were born without
our own knowledge or choice, by our parents coming together, and were
brought up in bad habits and wicked training; in order that we may not
remain the children of necessity and of ignorance, but may become the
children of choice and knowledge, and may obtain in the water the
remission of sins formerly committed, there is pronounced over him who
chooses to be born again, and has repented of his sins, the name of God
the Father and Lord of the universe; he who leads to the laver the
person that is to be washed calling him by this name alone. For no one
can utter the name of the ineffable God; and if any one dare to say that
there is a name, he raves with a hopeless madness. And this washing is
called illumination, because they who learn these things are illuminated
in their understandings. And in the name of Jesus Christ, who was
crucified under Pontius Pilate, and in the name of the Holy Ghost, who
through the prophets foretold all things about Jesus, he who is
illuminated is washed.
