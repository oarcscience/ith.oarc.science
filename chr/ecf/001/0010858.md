### <span id="ix.vii.xxi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XX.—Those pastors are to be heard to whom the apostles committed the Churches, possessing one and the same doctrine of salvation; the heretics, on the other hand, are to be avoided. We must think soberly with regard to the mysteries of the faith.

<span id="ix.vii.xxi-p1"></span>1. <span id="ix.vii.xxi-p1.1"></span>Now
all these \[heretics\] are of much later date than the bishops to whom
the apostles committed the Churches; which fact I have in the third book
taken all pains to demonstrate. It follows, then, as a matter of course,
that these <span id="page_548">p. 548</span> <span
id="ix.vii.xxi-Page_548"></span> heretics aforementioned, since they are
blind to the truth, and deviate from the \[right\] way, will walk in
various roads; and therefore the footsteps of their doctrine are
scattered here and there without agreement or connection. <span
id="ix.vii.xxi-p1.2"></span>But the path of those belonging to the
Church circumscribes the whole world, as possessing the sure tradition
from the apostles, and gives unto us to see that the faith of all is one
and the same, since all receive one and the same God the Father, and
believe in the same dispensation regarding the incarnation of the Son of
God, and are cognizant of the same gift of the Spirit, and are
conversant with the same commandments, and preserve the same form of
ecclesiastical constitution, <span id="fr_4618"></span>[4619](#fn_4618)
and expect the same advent of the Lord, and await the same salvation of
the complete man, that is, of the soul and body. And undoubtedly the
preaching of the Church is true and stedfast, <span
id="fr_4619"></span>[4620](#fn_4619) in which one and the same way of
salvation is shown throughout the whole world. For to her is entrusted
the light of God; and therefore the “wisdom” of God, by means of which
she saves all men, “is declared in \[its\] going forth; it uttereth
\[its voice\] faithfully in the streets, is preached on the tops of the
walls, and speaks continually in the gates of the city.” <span
id="fr_4620"></span>[4621](#fn_4620) For the Church preaches the truth
everywhere, and she is the seven-branched candlestick which bears the
light of Christ.

<span id="ix.vii.xxi-p5"></span>2. Those, therefore, who desert the
preaching of the Church, call in question the knowledge of the holy
presbyters, not taking into consideration of how much greater
consequence is a religious man, even in a private station, than a
blasphemous and impudent sophist. <span
id="fr_4621"></span>[4622](#fn_4621) Now, such are all the heretics, and
those who imagine that they have hit upon something more beyond the
truth, so that by following those things already mentioned, proceeding
on their way variously, inharmoniously, and foolishly, not keeping
always to the same opinions with regard to the same things, as blind men
are led by the blind, they shall deservedly fall into the ditch of
ignorance lying in their path, ever seeking and never finding out the
truth. <span id="fr_4622"></span>[4623](#fn_4622) It behoves us,
therefore, to avoid their doctrines, and to take careful heed lest we
suffer any injury from them; but to flee to the Church, and be brought
up in her bosom, and be nourished with the Lord’s Scriptures. For the
Church has been planted as a garden (*paradisus*) in this world;
therefore says the Spirit of God, “Thou mayest freely eat from every
tree of the garden,” <span id="fr_4623"></span>[4624](#fn_4623) that is,
Eat ye from every Scripture of the Lord; but ye shall not eat with an
uplifted mind, nor touch any heretical discord. For these men do profess
that they have themselves the knowledge of good and evil; and they set
their own impious minds above the God who made them. They therefore form
opinions on what is beyond the limits of the understanding. For this
cause also the apostle says, “Be not wise beyond what it is fitting to
be wise, but be wise prudently,” <span
id="fr_4624"></span>[4625](#fn_4624) that we be not cast forth by eating
of the “knowledge” of these men (that knowledge which knows more than it
should do) from the paradise of life. Into this paradise the Lord has
introduced those who obey His call, “summing up in Himself all things
which are in heaven, and which are on earth;” <span
id="fr_4625"></span>[4626](#fn_4625) but the things in heaven are
spiritual, while those on earth constitute the dispensation in human
nature (*secundum hominem est dispositio*). These things, therefore, He
recapitulated in Himself: by uniting man to the Spirit, and causing the
Spirit to dwell in man, He is Himself made the head of the Spirit, and
gives the Spirit to be the head of man: for through Him (the Spirit) we
see, and hear, and speak.
