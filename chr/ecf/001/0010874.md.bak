### <span id="ix.vii.xxxvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXVI.—Men shall be actually raised: the world shall not be annihilated; but there shall be various mansions for the saints, according to the rank allotted to each individual. All things shall be subject to God the Father, and so shall He be all in all.

<span id="ix.vii.xxxvii-p1"></span>1. <span
id="ix.vii.xxxvii-p1.1"></span>For since there are real men, so must
there also be a real establishment (*plantationem*), that they vanish
not away among non-existent things, but progress among those which have
an actual existence. <span id="ix.vii.xxxvii-p1.2"></span>For neither is
the substance nor the essence of the creation annihilated (for faithful
and true is He who has established it), but “the *fashion* of the world
passeth away;” <span id="fr_4783"></span>[4784](#fn_4783.md) that is, those
things among which transgression has occurred, since man has grown old
in them. And therefore this \[present\] fashion has been formed
temporary, God foreknowing all things; as I have pointed out in the
preceding book, <span id="fr_4784"></span>[4785](#fn_4784.md) and have also
shown, as far as was possible, the cause of the creation of this world
of temporal things. But when this \[present\] fashion \[of things\]
passes away, and man has been renewed, and flourishes in an
incorruptible state, so as to preclude the possibility of becoming old,
\[then\] there shall be the new heaven and the new earth, in which the
new man shall remain \[continually\], <span id="page_567">p. 567</span>
<span id="ix.vii.xxxvii-Page_567"></span> always holding fresh converse
with God. And since (*or*, that) these things shall ever continue
without end, Isaiah declares, “For as the new heavens and the new earth
which I do make, continue in my sight, saith the <span
class="upper"><span id="ix.vii.xxxvii-p3.1"></span>Lord</span>, so shall
your seed and your name remain.” <span
id="fr_4785"></span>[4786](#fn_4785.md) And as the presbyters say, Then
those who are deemed worthy of an abode in heaven shall go there, others
shall enjoy the delights of paradise, and others shall possess the
splendour of the city; for everywhere the Saviour <span
id="fr_4786"></span>[4787](#fn_4786.md) shall be seen according as they who
see Him shall be worthy.

<span id="ix.vii.xxxvii-p6"></span>2. <span
id="ix.vii.xxxvii-p6.1"></span><span
id="ix.vii.xxxvii-p6.2"></span>\[They say, moreover\], that there is
this distinction between the habitation of those who produce an
hundred-fold, and that of those who produce sixty-fold, and that of
those who produce thirty-fold: for the first will be taken up into the
heavens, the second will dwell in paradise, the last will inhabit the
city; and that was on this account the Lord declared, “In My Father’s
house are many mansions.” <span id="fr_4787"></span>[4788](#fn_4787.md) For
all things belong to God, who supplies all with a suitable
dwelling-place; even as His Word says, that a share is allotted to all
by the Father, according as each person is or shall be worthy. And this
is the couch on which the guests shall recline, having been invited to
the wedding. <span id="fr_4788"></span>[4789](#fn_4788.md) The presbyters,
the disciples of the apostles, affirm that this is the gradation and
arrangement of those who are saved, and that they advance through steps
of this nature; also that they ascend through the Spirit to the Son, and
through the Son to the Father, and that in due time the Son will yield
up His work to the Father, even as it is said by the apostle, “For He
must reign till He hath put all enemies under His feet. The last enemy
that shall be destroyed is death.” <span
id="fr_4789"></span>[4790](#fn_4789.md) For in the times of the kingdom,
the righteous man who is upon the earth shall then forget to die. “But
when He saith, All things shall be subdued unto Him, it is manifest that
He is excepted who did put all things under Him. And when all things
shall be subdued unto Him, then shall the Son also Himself be subject
unto Him who put all things under Him, that God may be all in
all.” <span id="fr_4790"></span>[4791](#fn_4790.md)

<span id="ix.vii.xxxvii-p11"></span>3. John, therefore, did distinctly
foresee the first “resurrection of the just,” <span
id="fr_4791"></span>[4792](#fn_4791.md) and the inheritance in the kingdom
of the earth; and what the prophets have prophesied concerning it
harmonize \[with his vision\]. For the Lord also taught these things,
when He promised that He would have the mixed cup new with His disciples
in the kingdom. The apostle, too, has confessed that the creation shall
be free from the bondage of corruption, \[so as to pass\] into the
liberty of the sons of God. <span id="fr_4792"></span>[4793](#fn_4792.md)
And in all these things, and by them all, the same God the Father is
manifested, who fashioned man, and gave promise of the inheritance of
the earth to the fathers, who brought it (the creature) forth \[from
bondage\] at the resurrection of the just, and fulfils the promises for
the kingdom of His Son; subsequently bestowing in a paternal manner
those things which neither the eye has seen, nor the ear has heard, nor
has \[thought concerning them\] arisen within the heart of man, <span
id="fr_4793"></span>[4794](#fn_4793.md) For there is the one Son, who
accomplished His Father’s will; and one human race also in which the
mysteries of God are wrought, “which the angels desire to look
into;” <span id="fr_4794"></span>[4795](#fn_4794.md) and they are not able
to search out the wisdom of God, by means of which His handiwork,
confirmed and incorporated with His Son, is brought to perfection; that
His offspring, the First-begotten Word, should descend to the creature
(*facturam*), that is, to what had been moulded (*plasma*), and that it
should be contained by Him; and, on the other hand, the creature should
contain the Word, and ascend to Him, passing beyond the angels, and be
made after the image and likeness of God. <span
