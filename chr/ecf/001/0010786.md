<span id="ix.iv.xx"></span>

### <span id="ix.iv.xx-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIX.—Jesus Christ was not a mere man, begotten from Joseph in the ordinary course of nature, but was very God, begotten of the Father most high, and very man, born of the Virgin.

<span id="ix.iv.xx-p1"></span>1. <span id="ix.iv.xx-p1.1"></span>But
again, those who assert that He was simply a mere man, begotten by
Joseph, remaining in the bondage of the old disobedience, are in a state
of death having been not as yet joined to the Word of God the Father,
nor receiving liberty through the Son, as He does Himself declare: “If
the Son shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.” <span
id="fr_3664"></span>[3665](#fn_3664.md) But, being ignorant of Him who from
the Virgin is Emmanuel, they are deprived of His gift, which is eternal
life; <span id="fr_3665"></span>[3666](#fn_3665.md) and not receiving the
incorruptible Word, they remain in mortal flesh, and are debtors to
death, not obtaining the antidote of life. To whom the Word says,
mentioning His own gift of grace: “I said, Ye are all the sons of the
Highest, and gods; but ye shall die like men.” <span
id="fr_3666"></span>[3667](#fn_3666.md) He speaks undoubtedly these words
to those who have not received the gift of adoption, but who despise the
incarnation of the pure generation of the Word of God, <span
id="fr_3667"></span>[3668](#fn_3667.md) defraud human nature of promotion
into God, and prove themselves ungrateful to the Word of God, who became
flesh for them. For it was for this end that the Word of God was made
man, and He who was the Son of God became the Son of man, that man,
having been taken into the Word, and receiving the adoption, might
become the son of God. For by no other means could we have attained to
incorruptibility and immortality, unless we had been united to
incorruptibility and immortality. But how could we be joined to
incorruptibility and immortality, unless, first, incorruptibility and
immortality had <span id="page_449">p. 449</span> <span
id="ix.iv.xx-Page_449"></span> become that which we also are, so that
the corruptible might be swallowed up by incorruptibility, and the
mortal by immortality, that we might receive the adoption of sons?

<span id="ix.iv.xx-p6"></span>2. For this reason \[it is, said\], “Who
shall declare His generation?” <span
id="fr_3668"></span>[3669](#fn_3668.md) since “He is a man, and who shall
recognise Him?” <span id="fr_3669"></span>[3670](#fn_3669.md) But he to
whom the Father which is in heaven has revealed Him, <span
id="fr_3670"></span>[3671](#fn_3670.md) knows Him, so that he understands
that He who “was not born either by the will of the flesh, or by the
will of man,” <span id="fr_3671"></span>[3672](#fn_3671.md) is the Son of
man, this is Christ, the Son of the living God. For I have shown from
the Scriptures, <span id="fr_3672"></span>[3673](#fn_3672.md) that no one
of the sons of Adam is as to everything, and absolutely, called God, or
named Lord. But that He is Himself in His own right, beyond all men who
ever lived, God, and Lord, and King Eternal, and the Incarnate Word,
proclaimed by all the prophets, the apostles, and by the Spirit Himself,
may be seen by all who have attained to even a small portion of the
truth. Now, the Scriptures would not have testified these things of Him,
if, like others, He had been a mere man. But that He had, beyond all
others, in Himself that pre-eminent birth which is from the Most High
Father, and also experienced that pre-eminent generation which is from
the Virgin, <span id="fr_3673"></span>[3674](#fn_3673.md) the divine
Scriptures do in both respects testify of Him: also, that He was a man
without comeliness, and liable to suffering; <span
id="fr_3674"></span>[3675](#fn_3674.md) that He sat upon the foal of an
ass; <span id="fr_3675"></span>[3676](#fn_3675.md) that He received for
drink, vinegar and gall; <span id="fr_3676"></span>[3677](#fn_3676.md) that
He was despised among the people, and humbled Himself even to death and
that He is the holy Lord, the Wonderful, the Counsellor, the Beautiful
in appearance, and the Mighty God, <span
id="fr_3677"></span>[3678](#fn_3677.md) coming on the clouds as the Judge
of all men; <span id="fr_3678"></span>[3679](#fn_3678.md) —all these things
did the Scriptures prophesy of Him.

<span id="ix.iv.xx-p18"></span>3. <span id="ix.iv.xx-p18.1"></span>For
as He became man in order to undergo temptation, so also was He the Word
that He might be glorified; the Word remaining quiescent, that He might
be capable of being tempted, dishonoured, crucified, and of suffering
death, but the human nature being swallowed up in it (the divine), when
it conquered, and endured \[without yielding\], and performed acts of
kindness, and rose again, and was received up \[into heaven\]. He
therefore, the Son of God, our Lord, being the Word of the Father, and
the Son of man, since He had a generation as to His human nature from
Mary—who was descended from mankind, and who was herself a human
being—was made the Son of man. <span
id="fr_3679"></span>[3680](#fn_3679.md) Wherefore also the Lord Himself
gave us a sign, in the depth below, and in the height above, which man
did not ask for, because he never expected that a virgin could conceive,
or that it was possible that one remaining a virgin could bring forth a
son, and that what was thus born should be “*God with us,*” and descend
to those things which are of the earth beneath, seeking the sheep which
had perished, which was indeed His own peculiar handiwork, and ascend to
the height above, offering and commending to His Father that human
nature (*hominem*) which had been found, making in His own person the
first-fruits of the resurrection of man; that, as the Head rose from the
dead, so also the remaining part of the body—\[namely, the body\] of
everyman who is found in life—when the time is fulfilled of that
condemnation which existed by reason of disobedience, may arise, blended
together and strengthened through means of joints and bands <span
id="fr_3680"></span>[3681](#fn_3680.md) by the increase of God, each of the
members having its own proper and fit position in the body. For there
are many mansions in the Father’s house, <span
id="fr_3681"></span>[3682](#fn_3681.md) inasmuch as there are also many
members in the body.

<span id="ix.iv.xx-p5"></span> The original Greek is preserved here by
Theodoret, differing in some respects from the old Latin version: <span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.iv.xx-p5.1"></span>καὶ ἀποστεροῦντας τὸν
ἄνθρωπον τῆς εἰς Θεὸν ἀνόδου καὶ ἀχαριστοῦντας τῷ ὑπὲρ αὐτῶν σαρκωθέντι
λόγῳ τοῦ Θεοῦ. Εἰς τοῦτο γὰρ ὁ λόγος ἄνθρωπος</span> … <span

χωρήσας</span>, <span class="Greek"><span id="ix.iv.xx-p5.3"></span>καὶ
τὴν υἱοθεσίαν λαβὼν, υἱὸς γένηται Θεοῦ.</span> The old Latin runs thus:
“fraudantes hominem ab ea ascensione quæ est ad Dominum, et ingrate
exsistentes Verbo Dei, qui incarnatus est propter ipsos. Propter hoc
enim Verbum Dei homo, et qui Filius Dei est, Filius Hominis factus est …
commixtus Verbo Dei, et adoptionem percipiens fiat filius Dei.” \[A
specimen of the liberties taken by the Latin translators with the
original of Irenæus. Others are much less innocent.\]
