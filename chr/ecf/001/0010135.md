### <span id="v.ii.xii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XII.—Praise of the Ephesians.

<span id="v.ii.xii-p1"></span>I know both who I am, and to whom I write.
I am a condemned man, ye have been the objects of <span id="page_55">p.
55</span> <span id="v.ii.xii-Page_55"></span> mercy; I am subject to
danger, ye are established in safety. Ye are the persons through <span
id="fr_570"></span>[571](#fn_570.md) whom those pass that are cut off for
the sake of God. Ye are initiated into the mysteries of the Gospel with
Paul, the holy, the martyred, the deservedly most happy, at whose
feet <span id="fr_571"></span>[572](#fn_571.md) may I be found, when I
shall attain to God; who in all his Epistles makes mention of you in
Christ Jesus.

<span id="v.ii.xii-p4"></span>I know both who I am, and to whom I write.
I am the very insignificant Ignatius, who have my lot with <span
id="fr_572"></span>[573](#fn_572.md) those who are exposed to danger and
condemnation. But ye have been the objects of mercy, and are established
in Christ. <span id="v.ii.xii-p5.1"></span>I am one delivered over \[to
death\], but the least of all those that have been cut off for the sake
of Christ, “from the blood of righteous Abel” <span
id="fr_573"></span>[574](#fn_573.md) to the blood of Ignatius. Ye are
initiated into the mysteries of the Gospel with Paul, the holy, the
martyred, inasmuch as he was “a chosen vessel;” <span
id="fr_574"></span>[575](#fn_574.md) at whose feet may I be found, and at
the feet of the rest of the saints, when I shall attain to Jesus Christ,
who is always mindful of you in His prayers.
