### <span id="ix.iii.xii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XI.—The heretics, from their disbelief of the truth, have fallen into an abyss of error: reasons for investigating their systems.

<span id="ix.iii.xii-p1"></span>1. <span
id="ix.iii.xii-p1.1"></span>They do not believe that He, who is God
above all, formed by His Word, in His own territory, as He Himself
pleased, the various and diversified \[works of creation which exist\],
inasmuch as He is the former of all things, like a wise architect, and a
most powerful monarch. But they believe that angels, or some power
separate from God, and who was ignorant of Him, formed this universe. By
this course, therefore, not yielding credit to the truth, but wallowing
in falsehood, they have lost the bread of true life, and have fallen
into vacuity <span id="fr_3034"></span>[3035](#fn_3034.md) and an abyss of
shadow. They are like the dog of Æsop, which dropped the bread, and made
an attempt at seizing its shadow, thus losing the \[real\] food. It is
easy to prove from the very words of the Lord, that He acknowledges one
Father and Creator of the world, and Fashioner of man, who was
proclaimed by the law and the prophets, while He knows no other, and
that this One is really God over all; and that He teaches that that
adoption of sons pertaining to the Father, which is eternal life, takes
place through Himself, conferring it \[as He does\] on all the
righteous.

<span id="ix.iii.xii-p3"></span> <span id="page_371">p. 371</span> <span
id="ix.iii.xii-Page_371"></span> 2. But since these men delight in
attacking us, and in their true character of cavillers assail us with
points which really tell not at all against us, bringing forward in
opposition to us a multitude of parables and \[captious\] questions, I
have thought it well, on the other side, first of all to put to them the
following inquiries concerning their own doctrines, to exhibit their
improbability, and to put an end to their audacity. After this has been
done, \[I intend\] to bring forward the discourses of the Lord, so that
they may not only be rendered destitute of the means of attacking us,
but that, since they will be unable reasonably to reply to those
questions which are put, they may see that their plan of argument is
destroyed; so that, either returning to the truth, and humbling
themselves, and ceasing from their multifarious phantasies, they may
propitiate God for those blasphemies they have uttered against Him, and
obtain salvation; or that, if they still persevere in that system of
vainglory which has taken possession of their minds, they may at least
find it necessary to change their kind of argument against us.
