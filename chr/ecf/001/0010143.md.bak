### <span id="v.ii.xx-p0.1"></span>Chapter XX.—Promise of another letter.

<span id="v.ii.xx-p1"></span>If Jesus Christ shall graciously permit me
through your prayers, and if it be His will, I shall, in a second little
work which I will write to you, make further manifest to you \[the
nature of\] the dispensation of which I have begun \[to treat\], with
respect to the new man, Jesus Christ, in His faith and in His love, in
His suffering and in His resurrection. Especially \[will I do this <span
id="fr_622"></span>[623](#fn_622.md) \] if the Lord make known to me that
ye come together <span id="page_58">p. 58</span> <span
id="v.ii.xx-Page_58"></span> man by man in common through grace,
individually, <span id="fr_623"></span>[624](#fn_623.md) in one faith, and
in Jesus Christ, who was of the seed of David according to the flesh,
being both the Son of man and the Son of God, so that ye obey the bishop
and the presbytery with an undivided mind, breaking one and the same
bread, which is the medicine of immortality, and the antidote to prevent
us from dying, but \[which causes\] that we should live for ever in
Jesus Christ.
