### <span id="ix.vi.xiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIII.—Christ did not abrogate the natural precepts of the law, but rather fulfilled and extended them. He removed the yoke and bondage of the old law, so that mankind, being now set free, might serve God with that trustful piety which becometh sons.

<span id="ix.vi.xiv-p1"></span>1. <span id="ix.vi.xiv-p1.1"></span><span
id="ix.vi.xiv-p1.2"></span>And that the Lord did not abrogate the
natural \[precepts\] of the law, by which man <span
id="fr_3947"></span>[3948](#fn_3947.md) is justified, which also those who
were justified by faith, and who pleased God, did observe previous to
the giving of the law, but that He extended and fulfilled them, is shown
from His words. “For,” He remarks, “it has been said to them of old
time, Do not commit adultery. But I say unto you, That every one who
hath looked upon a woman to lust after her, hath committed adultery with
her already in his heart.” <span id="fr_3948"></span>[3949](#fn_3948.md)
And again: “It has been said, Thou shalt not kill. But I say unto you,
Every one who is angry with his brother without a cause, shall be in
danger of the judgment.” <span id="fr_3949"></span>[3950](#fn_3949.md) And,
“It hath been said, Thou shalt not forswear thyself. But I say unto you,
Swear not at all; but let your conversation be, Yea, yea, and Nay,
nay.” <span id="fr_3950"></span>[3951](#fn_3950.md) And other statements of
a like nature. For all these do not contain or imply an opposition to
and an overturning of the \[precepts\] of the past, as Marcion’s
followers do strenuously maintain; but \[they exhibit\] a fulfilling and
an extension of them, as He does Himself declare: “Unless your
righteousness shall exceed that of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall
not enter into the kingdom of heaven.” <span
id="fr_3951"></span>[3952](#fn_3951.md) For what meant the excess referred
to? In the first place, \[we must\] believe not only in the Father, but
also in His Son now revealed; for He it is who leads man into fellowship
and unity with God. In the next place, \[we must\] not only say, but we
must do; for they said, but did not. And \[we must\] not only abstain
from evil deeds, but even from the desires after them. Now He did not
teach us these things as being opposed to the law, but as fulfilling the
law, and implanting in us the varied righteousness of the law. That
would have been contrary to the law, if He had commanded His disciples
to do anything which the law had prohibited. But this which He did
command—namely, not only to abstain from things forbidden by the law,
but even from longing after them—is not contrary to \[the law\], as I
have remarked, neither is it the utterance of one destroying the law,
but of one fulfilling, extending, and affording greater scope to it.

<span id="ix.vi.xiv-p7"></span>2. For the law, since it was laid down
for those in bondage, used to instruct the soul by means of those
corporeal objects which were of an external nature, drawing it, as by a
bond, to obey its commandments, that man might learn to serve God. But
the Word set free the soul, and taught that through it the body should
be willingly purified. Which having been accomplished, it followed as of
course, that the bonds of slavery should be removed, to which man had
now become accustomed, and that he should follow God without fetters:
moreover, that the laws of liberty should be extended, and subjection to
the king increased, so that no one who is converted should appear
unworthy to Him who set him free, but that the piety and obedience due
to the Master of the household should be equally rendered both by
servants and children; while the children possess greater confidence
\[than the servants\], inasmuch as the working of liberty is greater and
more glorious than that obedience which is rendered in \[a state of\]
slavery.

<span id="ix.vi.xiv-p8"></span>3. And for this reason did the Lord,
instead of that \[commandment\], “Thou shalt not commit adultery,”
forbid even concupiscence; and instead of that which runs thus, “Thou
shalt not kill,” He prohibited anger; and instead of the law enjoining
the giving of tithes, \[He told us\] to share <span
id="fr_3952"></span>[3953](#fn_3952.md) all our possessions with the poor;
and not to love our neighbours only, but even our enemies; and not
merely to be liberal givers and bestowers, but even that we should
present a gratuitous gift to those who take away our goods. For “to him
that taketh away thy coat,” He says, “give to him thy cloak also; and
from him that taketh away thy goods, ask them not again; and as ye would
that men should do unto you, do ye unto them:” <span
id="fr_3953"></span>[3954](#fn_3953.md) so that we may not grieve as those
who are unwilling to be defrauded, but may rejoice as those who have
given willingly, and as rather conferring a favour upon our neighbours
than yielding to necessity. “And if any one,” He says, “shall compel
thee \[to go\] a mile, go with him twain;” <span
id="fr_3954"></span>[3955](#fn_3954.md) so that thou mayest not follow him
as a slave, but may as a free man go before him, showing thyself in all
things kindly disposed and useful to thy neighbour, not regarding their
evil intentions, but performing thy kind offices, assimilating thyself
to the Father, “who maketh His sun to rise upon the evil and the good,
and sendeth <span id="page_478">p. 478</span> <span
id="ix.vi.xiv-Page_478"></span> rain upon the just and unjust.” <span
id="fr_3955"></span>[3956](#fn_3955.md) Now all these \[precepts\], as I
have already observed, were not \[the injunctions\] of one doing away
with the law, but of one fulfilling, extending, and widening it among
us; just as if one should say, that the more extensive operation of
liberty implies that a more complete subjection and affection towards
our Liberator had been implanted within us. For He did not set us free
for this purpose, that we should depart from Him (no one, indeed, while
placed out of reach of the Lord’s benefits, has power to procure for
himself the means of salvation), but that the more we receive His grace,
the more we should love Him. Now the more we have loved Him, the more
glory shall we receive from Him, when we are continually in the presence
of the Father.

<span id="ix.vi.xiv-p13"></span>4. Inasmuch, then, as all natural
precepts are common to us and to them (the Jews), they had in them
indeed the beginning and origin; but in us they have received growth and
completion. For to yield assent to God, and to follow His Word, and to
love Him above all, and one’s neighbour as one’s self (now man is
neighbour to man), and to abstain from every evil deed, and all other
things of a like nature which are common to both \[covenants\], do
reveal one and the same God. But this is our Lord, the Word of God, who
in the first instance certainly drew slaves to God, but afterwards He
set those free who were subject to Him, as He does Himself declare to
His disciples: “I will not now call you servants, for the servant
knoweth not what his lord doeth; but I have called you friends, for all
things which I have heard from My Father I have made known.” <span
id="fr_3956"></span>[3957](#fn_3956.md) For in that which He says, “I will
not now call you servants,” He indicates in the most marked manner that
it was Himself who did originally appoint for men that bondage with
respect to God through the law, and then afterwards conferred upon them
freedom. And in that He says, “For the servant knoweth not what his lord
doeth,” He points out, by means of His own advent, the ignorance of a
people in a servile condition. But when He terms His disciples “the
friends of God,” He plainly declares Himself to be the Word of God, whom
Abraham also followed voluntarily and under no compulsion (*sine
vinculis*), because of the noble nature of his faith, and so became “the
friend of God.” <span id="fr_3957"></span>[3958](#fn_3957.md) But the Word
of God did not accept of the friendship of Abraham, as though He stood
in need of it, for He was perfect from the beginning (“Before Abraham
was,” He says, “I am” <span id="fr_3958"></span>[3959](#fn_3958) .md), but
that He in His goodness might bestow eternal life upon Abraham himself,
inasmuch as the friendship of God imparts immortality to those who
embrace it.
