### <span id="v.x.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.

<span id="v.x.vi-p1"></span>Look ye to the bishop, that God also may
look upon you. I will be instead of the souls of those who are subject
to the bishop, and the presbyters, and the deacons; with them may I have
a portion in the presence of God! Labour together with one another, act
as athletes <span id="fr_1141"></span>[1142](#fn_1141) together, run
together, suffer together, sleep together, rise together. As stewards of
God, and of His household, <span id="fr_1142"></span>[1143](#fn_1142)
and His servants, please Him and serve Him, that ye may receive from Him
the wages \[promised\]. Let none of you be rebellious. Let your baptism
be to you as armour, and faith as a spear, and love as a helmet, and
patience as a panoply. Let your treasures be your good works, that ye
may receive the gift of God, as is just. Let your spirit be
long-suffering towards each other with meekness, even as God \[is\]
toward you. As for me, I rejoice in you at all times.
