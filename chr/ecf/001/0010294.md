### <span id="v.xvii.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.—Continuation.

<span id="v.xvii.vi-p1"></span><span id="v.xvii.vi-p1.1"></span>And how
can He be but God, who raises up the dead, sends away the lame sound of
limb, cleanses the lepers, restores sight to the blind, and either
increases or transmutes existing substances, as the five loaves and the
two fishes, and the water which became wine, and who puts to flight thy
whole host by a mere word? And why dost thou abuse the nature of the
Virgin, and style her members disgraceful, since thou didst of old
display such in public processions, <span
id="fr_1328"></span>[1329](#fn_1328) and didst order them to be
exhibited naked, males in the sight of females, and females to stir up
the unbridled lust of males? But now these are reckoned by thee
disgraceful, and thou pretendest to be full of modesty, thou spirit of
fornication, not knowing that then only anything becomes disgraceful
when it is polluted by wickedness. But when sin is not present, none of
the things that have been created are shameful, none of them evil, but
all very good. But inasmuch as thou art blind, thou revilest these
things.
