id="ix.viii.xiii-p1.2"></span>For <span
id="fr_4815"></span>[4816](#fn_4815.md) when the Greeks, having arrested
the slaves of Christian catechumens, then used force against them, in
order to learn from them some secret thing \[practised\] among
Christians, these slaves, having nothing to say that would meet the
wishes of their tormentors, except that they had heard from their
masters that the divine communion was the body and blood of Christ, and
imagining that it was actually flesh and blood, gave their inquisitors
answer to that effect. <span id="ix.viii.xiii-p2.3"></span>Then these
latter, assuming such to be the case with regard to the practices of
Christians, gave information regarding it to other Greeks, and sought to
compel the martyrs Sanctus and Blandina to confess, under the influence
of torture, \[that the allegation was correct\]. To these men Blandina
replied very admirably in these words: “How should those persons endure
such \[accusations\], who, for the sake of the practice \[of piety\],
did not avail themselves even of the flesh that was permitted \[them to
eat\]?”
