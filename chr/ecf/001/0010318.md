### <span id="v.xx.i-p0.1"></span>Ignatius, and the brethren who are with him, to John the holy presbyter.

<span id="v.xx.i-p1"></span><span id="v.xx.i-p1.1"></span><span
id="v.xx.i-p1.2"></span><span class="upper"><span
id="v.xx.i-p1.3"></span>We</span> are deeply grieved at thy delay in
strengthening us by thy addresses and consolations. If thy absence be
prolonged, it will disappoint many of us. Hasten then to come, for we
believe that it is expedient. There are also many of our women here, who
are desirous to see Mary \[the mother\] of Jesus, and wish day by day to
run off from us to you, that they may meet with her, and touch those
breasts of hers which nourished the Lord Jesus, and may inquire of her
respecting some rather secret matters. But Salome also, \[the daughter
of Anna,\] whom thou lovest, who stayed with her five months at
Jerusalem, and some other well-known persons, relate that she is full of
all graces and all virtues, after the manner of a virgin, fruitful in
virtue and grace. And, as they report, she is cheerful in persecutions
and afflictions, free from murmuring in the midst of penury and want,
grateful to those that injure her, and rejoices when exposed to
troubles: she sympathizes with the wretched and the afflicted as sharing
in their afflictions, and is not slow to come to their assistance.
Moreover, she shines forth gloriously as contending in the fight of
faith against the pernicious conflicts of vicious <span
id="fr_1383"></span>[1384](#fn_1383.md) principles or conduct. She is the
lady of our new religion and repentance, <span
id="fr_1384"></span>[1385](#fn_1384.md) and the handmaid among the faithful
of all works of piety. She is indeed devoted to the humble, and she
humbles herself more devotedly than the devoted, and is wonderfully
magnified by all, while at the same time she suffers detraction from the
Scribes and Pharisees. Besides these points, many relate to us numerous
other things regarding her. We do not, however, go so far as to believe
all in every particular; nor do we mention such to thee. But, as we are
informed by those who are worthy of credit, there is in Mary the mother
of Jesus an angelic purity of nature allied with the nature of
humanity. <span id="fr_1385"></span>[1386](#fn_1385.md) And such reports as
these have greatly excited our emotions, and urge us eagerly to desire a
sight of this (if it be lawful so to speak) heavenly prodigy and most
sacred marvel. But do thou in haste comply with this our desire; and
fare thou well. Amen.
