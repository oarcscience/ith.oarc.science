<p> <a name="v.ii.vi"></A>  <h3 align="center" align="center"><a name="v.ii.vi-p0.1"></A>Chapter VI.&#8212;Have respect to the bishop as to Christ Himself.</h3>  
<p><a name="v.ii.vi-p1"></A>Now the more any one sees the bishop keeping silence,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_526"></A><A HREF="#fn_526"><FONT SIZE="1">527</FONT></A>
 the more ought he to revere him. For we ought to receive every one whom the Master of the house sends to be over His household,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_527"></A><A HREF="#fn_527"><FONT SIZE="1">528</FONT></A>
 as we would do Him that sent him. It is manifest, therefore, that we should look upon the bishop even as we would upon the  <A NAME="page_52"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 52</FONT></A> <a name="v.ii.vi-Page_52"></A>  Lord Himself. And indeed Onesimus himself greatly commends your good order in God, that ye all live according to the truth, and that no sect&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_528"></A><A HREF="#fn_528"><FONT SIZE="1">529</FONT></A>
 has any dwelling-place among you. Nor, indeed, do ye hearken to any one rather than to Jesus Christ speaking in truth.</p>  
<p><a name="v.ii.vi-p5"></A>The more, therefore, you see the bishop silent, the more do you reverence him. For we ought to receive every one whom the Master of the house sends to be over His household,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_529"></A><A HREF="#fn_529"><FONT SIZE="1">530</FONT></A>
 as we would do Him that sent him. It is manifest, therefore, that we should look upon the bishop even as we would look upon the Lord Himself, standing, as he does, before the Lord. For &#8220;it behoves the man who looks carefully about him, and is active in his business, to stand before kings, and not to stand before slothful men.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_530"></A><A HREF="#fn_530"><FONT SIZE="1">531</FONT></A>
 And indeed Onesimus himself greatly commends your good order in God, that ye all live according to the truth, and that no sect has any dwelling-place among you. Nor indeed do ye hearken to any one rather than to Jesus Christ, the true Shepherd and Teacher. And ye are, as Paul wrote to you, &#8220;one body and one spirit, because ye have also been called in one hope of the faith.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_531"></A><A HREF="#fn_531"><FONT SIZE="1">532</FONT></A>
 Since also &#8220;there is one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, who is over all, and through all, and in all.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_532"></A><A HREF="#fn_532"><FONT SIZE="1">533</FONT></A>
 Such, then, are ye, having been taught by such instructors, Paul the Christ-bearer, and Timothy the most faithful.</p>
