### <span id="v.xix.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.—He had complied with her request.

<span id="v.xix.iii-p1"></span>I have gladly acted as requested in thy
letter, <span id="fr_1378"></span>[1379](#fn_1378.md) having no doubt
respecting those persons whom thou didst prove to be men of worth. For I
am sure that thou barest testimony to them in the exercise of a godly
judgment, <span id="fr_1379"></span>[1380](#fn_1379.md) and not through the
influence of carnal favour. And thy numerous quotations of Scripture
passages exceedingly delighted me, which, when I had read, I had no
longer a single doubtful thought respecting the matter. For I did not
hold that those things were simply to be glanced over by my eyes, of
which I had received from thee such an incontrovertible demonstration.
May I be in place of thy soul, because thou lovest Jesus, the Son of the
living God. Wherefore also He Himself says to thee, “I love them that
love Me; and those that seek Me shall find peace.” <span
