### <span id="viii.ii.xlii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XLII.—Prophecy using the past tense.

<span id="viii.ii.xlii-p1"></span><span
id="viii.ii.xlii-p1.1"></span>But when the Spirit of prophecy speaks of
things that are about to come to pass as if they had already taken
place, —as may be observed even in the passages already cited by me,
—that <span id="page_177">p. 177</span> <span
id="viii.ii.xlii-Page_177"></span> this circumstance may afford no
excuse to readers \[for misinterpreting them\], we will make even this
also quite plain. The things which He absolutely knows will take place,
He predicts as if already they had taken place. And that the utterances
must be thus received, you will perceive, if you give your attention to
them. The words cited above, David uttered 1500 <span
id="fr_1853"></span>[1854](#fn_1853) years before Christ became a man
and was crucified; and no one of those who lived before Him, nor yet of
His contemporaries, afforded joy to the Gentiles by being crucified.
<span id="viii.ii.xlii-p2.1"></span>But our Jesus Christ, being
crucified and dead, rose again, and having ascended to heaven, reigned;
and by those things which were published in His name among all nations
by the apostles, there is joy afforded to those who expect the
immortality promised by Him.
