### <span id="v.xv.xiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIII.—Salutations continued.

<span id="v.xv.xiii-p1"></span>I salute Cassian and his partner in life,
and their very dear children. Polycarp, that most worthy bishop, who is
also deeply interested in you, salutes you; and to him I have commended
you in the Lord. The whole Church of the Smyrnæans, indeed, is mindful
of you in their prayers in the Lord. Onesimus, the pastor of the
Ephesians, salutes you. Damas, <span
id="fr_1261"></span>[1262](#fn_1261.md) the bishop of Magnesia, salutes
you. Polybius, bishop of the Trallians, salutes you. Philo and
Agathopus, the deacons, my companions, salute you, “Salute one another
with a holy kiss.” <span id="fr_1262"></span>[1263](#fn_1262.md)
