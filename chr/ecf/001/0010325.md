## <span id="v.xxiv-p0.1"></span>Introductory Note to the Martyrdom of Ignatius

<span id="v.xxiv-p1"></span><span class="upper"><span
id="v.xxiv-p1.1"></span>The</span> learned dissertation of Pearson, on
the difficulties of reconciling the supposed year of the martyrdom with
the history of Trajan, etc., is given entire in Jacobson (vol. ii. p.
524), against the decision of Usher for <span class="upper"><span
id="v.xxiv-p1.2"></span>a.d.</span> 107. Pearson accepts <span
class="upper"><span id="v.xxiv-p1.3"></span>a.d.</span> 116. Consult
also the preface of Dr. Thomas Smith, <span
id="fr_1394"></span>[1395](#fn_1394) in the same work (p. 518), on the
text of the original and of the Latin versions, and on the credibility
of the narrative. Our learned translators seem to think the text they
have used, to be without interpolation. If the simple-minded faithful of
those days, so near the age of miracles, appear to us, in some degree,
enthusiasts, let us remember the vision of Col. Gardiner, accredited by
Doddridge, Lord Lyttleton’s vision (see Boswell, *anno* 1784, chap.
xi.), accepted by Johnson and his contemporaries, and the interesting
narrative of the pious Mr. Tennent of New Jersey, attested by so many
excellent and intelligent persons, almost of our own times.

<span id="v.xxiv-p3"></span>The following is the <span
class="upper"><span id="v.xxiv-p3.1"></span>Introductory Notice</span>
of the translators:—

<span id="v.xxiv-p4"></span><span class="upper"><span
id="v.xxiv-p4.1"></span>The</span> following account of the martyrdom of
Ignatius professes, in several passages, to have been written by those
who accompanied him on his voyage to Rome, and were present on the
occasion of his death (chaps. v. vi. vii.). And if the genuineness of
this narrative, as well as of the Ignatian Epistles, be admitted, there
can be little doubt that the persons in question were Philo and
Agathopus, with Crocus perhaps, all of whom are mentioned by Ignatius
(*Epist. to Smyr.*, chap. x.; *to Philad.*, chap. xi.; *to Rom.*, chap.
x.) as having attended him on that journey to Rome which resulted in his
martyrdom. But doubts have been started, by Daillé and others, as to the
date and authorship of this account. Some of these rest upon internal
considerations, but the weightiest objection is found in the fact that
no reference to this narrative is to be traced during the first six
centuries of our era. <span id="fr_1395"></span>[1396](#fn_1395) This is
certainly a very suspicious circumstance, and may well give rise to some
hesitation in ascribing the authorship to the immediate companions and
friends of Ignatius. On the other hand, however, this account of the
death of Ignatius is in perfect harmony with the particulars recounted
by Eusebius and Chrysostom regarding him. Its comparative simplicity,
too, is greatly in its favour. It makes no reference to the legends
which by and by connected themselves with the name of Ignatius. As is
well known, he came in course of time to be identified with the child
whom Christ ([Matt. xviii. 2](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#002)<span
id="v.xxiv-p5.1"></span>) set before His disciples as a pattern of
humility. It was said that the Saviour took him up in His arms, and that
hence Ignatius <span id="page_128">p. 128</span> <span
id="v.xxiv-Page_128"></span> derived his name of *Theophorus*; <span
id="fr_1396"></span>[1397](#fn_1396) that is, according to the
explanation which this legend gives of the word, *one carried by God*.
But in chap. ii. of the following narrative we find the term explained
to mean, “one who has Christ in his breast;” and this simple
explanation, with the entire silence preserved as to the marvels
afterwards connected with the name of Ignatius, is certainly a strong
argument in favour of the early date and probable genuineness of the
account. Some critics, such as Usher and Grabe, have reckoned the latter
part of the narrative spurious, while accepting the former; but there
appears to be a unity about it which requires us either to accept it *in
toto*, or to reject it altogether. <span

<span id="v.xxiv-p5"></span> \[A most remarkable statement. “References”
may surely be *traced*, at least in Eusebius (iii. 36) and Irenæus
(*Adv. Hæres.* v. 28), if not in Jerome, etc. But the sermon of St.
Chrysostom (Opp. ii. 593) seems almost, in parts, a paraphrase.\]

<span id="v.xxiv-p6"></span> \[See on this matter Jacobson’s note (vol
ii. p. 262), and reference to Pearson (*Vind. Ignat.*, part ii. cap.
12). The false accentuation (<span class="Greek"><span
id="v.xxiv-p6.1"></span>Θεόφορος</span>) occurs in some copies to
support the myth of the child Ignatius as the *God-borne* instead of the
*God-bearing*; i.e., carried by Christ, instead of carrying the Spirit
of Christ within.\]
