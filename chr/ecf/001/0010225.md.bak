### <span id="v.x.ii-p0.1"></span>Chapter II.

<span id="v.x.ii-p1"></span>If thou lovest the good disciples only, thou
hast no grace; \[but\] rather subdue those that are evil by gentleness.
All \[sorts of\] wounds are not healed by the same medicine. Mitigate
\[the pain of\] cutting <span id="fr_1133"></span>[1134](#fn_1133.md) by
tenderness. Be wise as the serpent in everything, and innocent, with
respect to those things which are requisite, even as the dove. For this
reason thou art \[composed\] of both flesh and spirit, that thou mayest
entice <span id="fr_1134"></span>[1135](#fn_1134.md) those things which are
visible before thy face, and mayest ask, as to those which are concealed
from thee, that they \[too\] may be revealed to thee, in order that thou
be deficient in nothing, and mayest abound in all gifts. The time
demands, even as a pilot does a ship, and as one who stands exposed to
the tempest does a haven, that thou shouldst be worthy of God. Be thou
watchful as an athlete of God. That which is promised to us is life
eternal, which cannot be corrupted, of which things thou art also
persuaded. In everything I will be instead <span
id="fr_1135"></span>[1136](#fn_1135.md) of thy soul, and my bonds which
thou hast loved.

<span id="v.x.ii-p2"></span> Cureton observes, as one alternative here,
that “the Syrian translator seems to have read <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.x.ii-p2.1"></span>παράξυσμα</span> for <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.x.ii-p2.2"></span>παροξυσμούς</span>.”

<span id="fn_1134"></span>[99:1135](0010225.htm#fr_1134.md) <span
id="v.x.ii-p2.3"></span>

<span id="v.x.ii-p3"></span> Or, “flatter,” probably meaning to “deal
gently with.”

<span id="fn_1135"></span>[99:1136](0010225.htm#fr_1135.md) <span
id="v.x.ii-p3.1"></span>

<span id="v.x.ii-p4"></span> Thus the Syriac renders <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.x.ii-p4.1"></span>ἀντίψυχον</span> in the
Greek.
