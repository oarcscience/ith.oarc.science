### <span id="vi.ii.xvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVII.—Conclusion of the first part of the epistle.

<span id="vi.ii.xvii-p1"></span>As far as was possible, and could be
done with perspicuity, I cherish the hope that, according to my desire,
I have omitted none <span id="fr_1682"></span>[1683](#fn_1682) of those
things at present \[demanding consideration\], which bear upon your
salvation. For if I should write to you about things future, <span
id="fr_1683"></span>[1684](#fn_1683) ye would not understand, because
such knowledge is hid in parables. These things then are so.

<span id="vi.ii.xvii-p3"></span> Cod. Sin., “about things present or
future.” Hilgenfeld’s text of this passage is as follows: “My mind and
soul hopes that, according to my desire, I have omitted none of the
things that pertain to salvation. For if I should write to you about
things present or future,” etc. Hefele gives the text as above, and
understands the meaning to be, “points bearing on the *present*
argument.”
