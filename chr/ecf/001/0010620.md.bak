### <span id="viii.vi.x-p0.1"></span>Chapter X—Training and inspiration of Moses. <span id="fr_2538"></span>[2539](#fn_2538.md)

things, ye men of Greece, have been recorded in writing concerning the
antiquity of Moses by those who were not of our religion; and they said
that they learned all these things from the Egyptian priests, among whom
Moses was not only born, but also was thought worthy of partaking of all
the education of the Egyptians, on account of his being adopted by the
king’s daughter as her son; and for the same reason was thought worthy
of great attention, as the wisest of the historians relate, who have
chosen to record his life and actions, and the rank of his descent, —I
speak of Philo and Josephus. For these, in their narration of the
history of the Jews, say that Moses was sprung from the race of the
Chaldæans, and that he was born in Egypt when his forefathers had
migrated on account of famine from Phœnicia to that country; and him God
chose to honour on account of his exceeding virtue, and judged him
worthy to become the leader and lawgiver of his own race, when He
thought it right that the people of the Hebrews should return out of
Egypt into their own land. To him first did God communicate that divine
and prophetic gift which in those days descended upon the holy men, and
him also did He first <span id="page_278">p. 278</span> <span
id="viii.vi.x-Page_278"></span> furnish that he might be our teacher in
religion, and then after him the rest of the prophets, who both obtained
the same gift as he, and taught us the same doctrines concerning the
same subjects. These we assert to have been our teachers, who taught us
nothing from their own human conception, but from the gift vouchsafed to
them by God from above.
