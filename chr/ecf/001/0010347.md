### <span id="vi.ii.xi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XI.—Baptism and the cross prefigured in the Old Testament.

<span id="vi.ii.xi-p1"></span><span id="vi.ii.xi-p1.1"></span><span
id="vi.ii.xi-p1.2"></span><span id="vi.ii.xi-p1.3"></span>Let us further
inquire whether the Lord took any care to foreshadow the water \[of
baptism\] and the cross. Concerning the water, indeed, it is written, in
reference to the Israelites, that they should not receive that baptism
which leads to the remission of sins, but should procure <span
id="fr_1590"></span>[1591](#fn_1590) another for themselves. The prophet
therefore declares, “Be astonished, O heaven, and let the earth
tremble <span id="fr_1591"></span>[1592](#fn_1591) at this, because this
people hath committed two great evils: they have forsaken Me, a living
fountain, and have hewn out for themselves broken cisterns. <span
id="fr_1592"></span>[1593](#fn_1592) Is my holy hill Zion a desolate
rock? For ye shall be as the fledglings of a bird, which fly away when
the nest is removed.” <span id="fr_1593"></span>[1594](#fn_1593) And
again saith the prophet, “I will go before thee and make level the
mountains, and will break the brazen gates, and bruise in pieces the
iron bars; and I will give thee the secret, <span
id="fr_1594"></span>[1595](#fn_1594) hidden, invisible treasures, that
they may know that I am the Lord God.” <span
id="fr_1595"></span>[1596](#fn_1595) And “He shall dwell in a lofty cave
of the strong rock.” <span id="fr_1596"></span>[1597](#fn_1596)
Furthermore, what saith He in reference to the Son? “His water is
sure; <span id="fr_1597"></span>[1598](#fn_1597) ye shall see the King
in His glory, and your soul shall meditate on the fear of the
Lord.” <span id="fr_1598"></span>[1599](#fn_1598) <span
id="vi.ii.xi-p10.2"></span>And again He saith in another prophet, “The
man who doeth these things shall be like a tree planted by the courses
of waters, which shall yield its fruit in due season; and his leaf shall
not fade, and all that he doeth shall prosper. Not so are the ungodly,
not so, but even as chaff, which the wind sweeps away from the face of
the earth. Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in judgment, nor
sinners in the counsel of the just; for the Lord knoweth the way of the
righteous, but the way of the ungodly shall perish.” <span
id="fr_1599"></span>[1600](#fn_1599) Mark how He has described at once
both the water and the cross. For these words imply, Blessed are they
who, placing their trust in the cross, have gone down into the water;
for, says He, they shall receive their reward in due time: then He
declares, I will recompense them. But now He saith, <span
id="fr_1600"></span>[1601](#fn_1600) “Their leaves shall not fade.” This
meaneth, that every word which proceedeth out of your mouth in faith and
love shall tend to bring conversion and hope to many. Again, another
prophet saith, “And the land of Jacob shall be extolled above every
land.” <span id="fr_1601"></span>[1602](#fn_1601) This meaneth the
vessel of His Spirit, which He shall glorify. Further, what says He?
“And there was a river flowing on the right, and from it arose beautiful
trees; and whosoever shall eat of them shall live for ever.” <span
id="fr_1602"></span>[1603](#fn_1602) This meaneth, <span
id="fr_1603"></span>[1604](#fn_1603) that we indeed descend into the
water full of sins and defilement, but come up, bearing fruit in our
heart, having the fear \[of God\] and trust in Jesus in our spirit. “And
whosoever shall eat of these shall live for ever,” This meaneth:
Whosoever, He declares, shall hear thee speaking, and believe, shall
live for ever.
