### <span id="ix.ii.xv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIV.—The various hypotheses of Marcus and others. Theories respecting letters and syllables.

<span id="ix.ii.xv-p1"></span>1. <span id="ix.ii.xv-p1.1"></span><span
id="ix.ii.xv-p1.2"></span>This Marcus <span
id="fr_2826"></span>[2827](#fn_2826.md) then, declaring that he alone was
the matrix and receptacle of the Sige of Colorbasus, inasmuch as he was
only-begotten, has brought to the birth in some such way as follows that
which was committed to him of the defective Enthymesis. He declares that
the infinitely exalted Tetrad descended upon him from the invisible and
indescribable places in the form of a woman (for the world could not
have borne it coming in its male form), and expounded to him alone its
own nature, and the origin of all things, which it had never before
revealed to any one either of gods or men. This was done in the
following terms: When first the unoriginated, inconceivable Father, who
is without material substance, <span
id="fr_2827"></span>[2828](#fn_2827.md) and is neither male nor female,
willed to bring forth that which is ineffable to Him, and to endow with
form that which is invisible, He opened His mouth, and sent forth the
Word similar to Himself, who, standing near, showed Him what He Himself
was, inasmuch as He had been manifested in the form of that which was
invisible. Moreover, the pronunciation of His name took place as
follows:—He spoke the first word of it, which was the beginning <span
id="fr_2828"></span>[2829](#fn_2828.md) \[of all the rest\], and that
utterance consisted of four letters. He added the second, and this also
consisted of four letters. Next He uttered the third, and this again
embraced ten letters. Finally, He pronounced the fourth, which was
composed of twelve letters. Thus took place the enunciation of the whole
name, consisting of thirty letters, and four distinct utterances. Each
of these elements has its own peculiar letters, and character, and
pronunciation, and forms, and images, and there is not one of them that
perceives the shape of that \[utterance\] of which it is an element.
Neither does any one know <span id="fr_2829"></span>[2830](#fn_2829.md)
itself, nor is it acquainted with the pronunciation of its neighbour,
but each one imagines that by its own utterance it does in fact name the
whole. For while every one of them is a part of the whole, it imagines
its own sound to be the whole name, and does not leave off sounding
until, by its own utterance, it has reached the last letter of each of
the elements. This teacher declares that the restitution of all things
will take place, when all these, mixing into one letter, shall utter one
and the same sound. He imagines that the emblem of this utterance is
found in *Amen*, which we pronounce in concert. <span
id="fr_2830"></span>[2831](#fn_2830) The diverse sounds (he adds.md) are
those which give form to that Æon who is without material substance and
unbegotten, and these, again, are the forms which the Lord has called
angels, who continually behold the face of the Father. <span
id="fr_2831"></span>[2832](#fn_2831.md)

<span id="ix.ii.xv-p8"></span>2. Those names of the elements which may
be told, and are common, he has called Æons, and words, and roots, and
seeds, and fulnesses, and fruits. He asserts that each of these, and all
that is peculiar to every one of them, is to be understood as contained
in the name Ecclesia. Of these elements, the last letter of the last one
uttered its voice, and this sound <span
id="fr_2832"></span>[2833](#fn_2832.md) going forth generated its own
elements after the image of the \[other\] elements, by which he affirms,
that both the things here below were arranged into the order they
occupy, and those that preceded them were called into existence. He also
maintains that the letter itself, the sound of which followed that sound
below, was received up again by the syllable to which it belonged, in
order to the completion of the whole, but that the sound remained below
as if cast outside. But the element itself from which the letter with
its special pronunciation descended to that below, he affirms to consist
of thirty letters, while each of these letters, again, contains other
letters in itself, by means of which the name of the letter is
expressed. And thus, again, others are named by other letters, and
others still by others, so that the multitude of letters swells out into
infinitude. You may more clearly understand what I mean by the following
example:—The word *Delta* contains <span id="page_337">p. 337</span>
<span id="ix.ii.xv-Page_337"></span> five letters, viz., D, E, L, T, A:
these letters again, are written by other letters, <span
id="fr_2833"></span>[2834](#fn_2833.md) and others still by others. If,
then, the entire composition of the word Delta \[when thus analyzed\]
runs out into infinitude, letters continually generating other letters,
and following one another in constant succession, how much vaster than
that \[one\] word is the \[entire\] ocean of letters! And if even one
letter be thus infinite, just consider the immensity of the letters in
the entire name; out of which the Sige of Marcus has taught us the
Propator is composed. For which reason the Father, knowing the
incomprehensibleness of His own nature, assigned to the elements which
He also terms Æons, \[the power\] of each one uttering its own
enunciation, because no one of them was capable by itself of uttering
the whole.

<span id="ix.ii.xv-p11"></span>3. <span id="ix.ii.xv-p11.1"></span><span
id="ix.ii.xv-p11.2"></span>Moreover, the Tetrad, explaining these things
to him more fully, said:—I wish to show thee Aletheia (Truth) herself;
for I have brought her down from the dwellings above, that thou mayest
see her without a veil, and understand her beauty —that thou mayest also
hear her speaking, and admire her wisdom. Behold, then, her head on
high, *Alpha* and *Omega*; her neck, *Beta* and *Psi*; her shoulders
with her hands, *Gamma* and *Chi*; her breast, *Delta* and *Phi*; her
diaphragm, *Epsilon* and *Upsilon*; her back, *Zeta* and *Tau*; her
belly, *Eta* and *Sigma*; her thighs, *Theta* and *Rho*; her knees,
*Iota* and *Pi*; her legs, *Kappa* and *Omicron*; her ankles, *Lambda*
and *Xi*; her feet, *Mu* and *Nu*. Such is the body of Truth, according
to this magician, such the figure of the element, such the character of
the letter. And he calls this element Anthropos (Man), and says that is
the fountain of all speech, and the beginning of all sound, and the
expression of all that is unspeakable, and the mouth of the silent Sige.
This indeed is the body of Truth. But do thou, elevating the thoughts of
thy mind on high, listen from the mouth of Truth to the self-begotten
Word, who is also the dispenser of the bounty of the Father.

<span id="ix.ii.xv-p12"></span>4. When she (the Tetrad) had spoken these
things, Aletheia looked at him, opened her mouth, and uttered a word.
That word was a name, and the name was this one which we do know and
speak of, viz., Christ Jesus. When she had uttered this name, she at
once relapsed into silence. And as Marcus waited in the expectation that
she would say something more, the Tetrad again came forward and
said:—Thou hast reckoned as contemptible that word which thou hast heard
from the mouth of Aletheia. This which thou knowest and seemest to
possess, is not an ancient name. For thou possessest the sound of it
merely, whilst thou art ignorant of its power. For Jesus (<span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.ii.xv-p12.1"></span>᾽Ιησοῦς</span>) is a name
arithmetically <span id="fr_2834"></span>[2835](#fn_2834.md) symbolical,
consisting of six letters, and is known by all those that belong to the
called. But that which is among the Æons of the Pleroma consists of many
parts, and is of another form and shape, and is known by those
\[angels\] who are joined in affinity with Him, and whose figures
(mightinesses) are always present with Him.

<span id="ix.ii.xv-p14"></span>5. Know, then, that the four-and-twenty
letters which you possess are symbolical emanations of the three powers
that contain the entire number of the elements above. For you are to
reckon thus —that the nine mute <span
id="fr_2835"></span>[2836](#fn_2835.md) letters are \[the images\] of Pater
and Aletheia, because they are without voice, that is, of such a nature
as cannot be uttered or pronounced. But the semi-vowels <span
id="fr_2836"></span>[2837](#fn_2836.md) represent Logos and Zoe, because
they are, as it were, midway between the consonants and the vowels,
partaking <span id="fr_2837"></span>[2838](#fn_2837.md) of the nature of
both. The vowels, again, are representative of Anthropos and Ecclesia,
inasmuch as a voice proceeding from Anthropos gave being to them all;
for the sound of the voice imparted to them form. Thus, then, Logos and
Zoe possess eight \[of these letters\]; Anthropos and Ecclesia seven;
and Pater and Aletheia nine. But since the number allotted to each was
unequal, He who existed in the Father came down, having been specially
sent by Him from whom He was separated, for the rectification of what
had taken place, that the unity of the Pleromas, being endowed with
equality, might develop in all that one power which flows from all. Thus
that division which had only seven letters, received the power of
eight, <span id="fr_2838"></span>[2839](#fn_2838.md) and the three sets
were rendered alike in point of number, all becoming Ogdoads; which
three, when brought together, constitute the number four-and-twenty. The
three elements, too (which he declares to exist in conjunction with
three powers, <span id="fr_2839"></span>[2840](#fn_2839.md) and thus form
the six from which have flowed the twenty-four letters), being
quadrupled by the word of the ineffable Tetrad, give rise to the same
number with them; and these elements he maintains to belong to Him who
cannot be named. These, again, were endowed by the three powers with a
resemblance to Him who is invisible. And he says that those letters
which we call double <span id="fr_2840"></span>[2841](#fn_2840.md) are the
images of <span id="page_338">p. 338</span> <span
id="ix.ii.xv-Page_338"></span> the images of these elements; and if
these be added to the four-and-twenty letters, by the force of analogy
they form the number thirty.

<span id="ix.ii.xv-p21"></span>6. He asserts that the fruit of this
arrangement and analogy has been manifested in the likeness of an image,
namely, Him who, after six days, ascended <span
id="fr_2841"></span>[2842](#fn_2841.md) into the mountain along with three
others, and then became one of six (the sixth), <span
id="fr_2842"></span>[2843](#fn_2842.md) in which character He descended and
was contained in the Hebdomad, since He was the illustrious
Ogdoad, <span id="fr_2843"></span>[2844](#fn_2843.md) and contained in
Himself the entire number of the elements, which the descent of the dove
(who is Alpha and Omega) made clearly manifest, when He came to be
baptized; for the number of the dove is eight hundred and one. <span
id="fr_2844"></span>[2845](#fn_2844.md) And for this reason did Moses
declare that man was formed on the sixth day; and then, again, according
to arrangement, it was on the sixth day, which is the preparation, that
the last man appeared, for the regeneration of the first. Of this
arrangement, both the beginning and the end were formed at that sixth
hour, at which He was nailed to the tree. For that perfect being Nous,
knowing that the number six had the power both of formation and
regeneration, declared to the children of light, that regeneration which
has been wrought out by Him who appeared as the *Episemon* in regard to
that number. Whence also he declares it is that the double letters <span
id="fr_2845"></span>[2846](#fn_2845.md) contain the Episemon number; for
this Episemon, when joined to the twenty-four elements, completed the
name of thirty letters.

<span id="ix.ii.xv-p27"></span>7. He employed as his instrument, as the
Sige of Marcus declares, the power of seven letters, <span
id="fr_2846"></span>[2847](#fn_2846.md) in order that the fruit of the
independent will \[of Achamoth\] might be revealed. “Consider this
present *Episemon*,” she says—“Him who was formed after the \[original\]
*Episemon*, as being, as it were, divided or cut into two parts, and
remaining outside; who, by His own power and wisdom, through means of
that which had been produced by Himself, gave life to this world,
consisting of seven powers, <span id="fr_2847"></span>[2848](#fn_2847.md)
after the likeness of the power of the Hebdomad, and so formed it, that
it is the soul of everything visible. And He indeed uses this work
Himself as if it had been formed by His own free will; but the rest, as
being images of what cannot be \[fully\] imitated, are subservient to
the Enthymesis of the mother. And the first heaven indeed pronounces
*Alpha*, the next to this *Epsilon*, the third *Eta*, the fourth, which
is also in the midst of the seven, utters the sound of *Iota*, the fifth
*Omicron*, the sixth *Upsilon*, the seventh, which is also the fourth
from the middle, utters the elegant *Omega*,”— as the Sige of Marcus,
talking a deal of nonsense, but uttering no word of truth, confidently
asserts. “And these powers,” she adds, “being all simultaneously clasped
in each other’s embrace, do sound out the glory of Him by whom they were
produced; and the glory of that sound is transmitted upwards to the
Propator.” She asserts, moreover, that “the sound of this uttering of
praise, having been wafted to the earth, has become the Framer and the
Parent of those things which are on the earth.”

<span id="ix.ii.xv-p30"></span>8. He instances, in proof of this, the
case of infants who have just been born, the cry of whom, as soon as
they have issued from the womb, is in accordance with the sound of every
one of these elements. As, then, he says, the seven powers glorify the
Word, so also does the complaining soul of infants. <span
id="fr_2848"></span>[2849](#fn_2848.md) For this reason, too, David said:
“Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings Thou hast perfected
praise;” <span id="fr_2849"></span>[2850](#fn_2849.md) and again: “The
heavens declare the glory of God.” <span
id="fr_2850"></span>[2851](#fn_2850.md) Hence also it comes to pass, that
when the soul is involved in difficulties and distresses, for its own
relief it calls out, “Oh” (<span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.ii.xv-p33.2"></span>Ω</span>), in honour of the letter in
question, <span id="fr_2851"></span>[2852](#fn_2851.md) so that its cognate
soul above may recognise \[its distress\], and send down to it relief.

<span id="ix.ii.xv-p35"></span>9. Thus it is, that in regard to the
whole name, <span id="fr_2852"></span>[2853](#fn_2852.md) which consists of
thirty letters, and Bythus, who receives his increase from the letters
of this \[name\], and, moreover, the body of Aletheia, which is composed
of twelve members, each of which consists of two letters, and the voice
which she uttered without having spoken at all, and in regard to the
analysis of that name which cannot be expressed in words, and the soul
of the world and of man, according as they possess that arrangement,
which is after the image \[of things above\], he has uttered his
nonsensical opinions. It remains that I relate how the Tetrad showed him
from the names a power equal in number; so that nothing, my friend,
which I have received as spoken by him, may remain unknown to thee; and
thus thy request, often proposed to me, may be fulfilled.

<span id="fn_2826"></span>[336:2827](0010711.htm#fr_2826.md) <span
id="ix.ii.xv-p1.3"></span>

<span id="ix.ii.xv-p2"></span> This sentence has completely baffled all
the critics. \[Its banter, or mock gravity, has not been self-evident.\]
We cannot enter upon the wide field of discussion which it has opened
up, but would simply state that Irenæus here seems to us, as often, to
be playing upon the terms which were in common use among these heretics.
Marcus probably received his system from Colorbasus, and is here
declared, by the use of that jargon which Irenæus means to ridicule
while so employing it, to have proceeded to develop it in the way
described.

<span id="fn_2827"></span>[336:2828](0010711.htm#fr_2827.md) <span
id="ix.ii.xv-p2.1"></span>

<span id="ix.ii.xv-p3"></span> Such appears to be the meaning of <span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.ii.xv-p3.1"></span>ἀνούσιος</span> in this
passage. The meaning of <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.ii.xv-p3.2"></span>οὐσία</span> fluctuated for a time in the
early Church, and was sometimes used to denote *material substance*,
instead of its usual significance of *being*.

<span id="fn_2828"></span>[336:2829](0010711.htm#fr_2828.md) <span
id="ix.ii.xv-p3.3"></span>

<span id="ix.ii.xv-p4"></span> The old Latin preserves <span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.ii.xv-p4.1"></span>ἀρχή</span> untranslated,
implying that this was the first word which the Father spoke. Some
modern editors adopt this view, while others hold the meaning simply to
be, as given above, that that first sound which the Father uttered was
the origin of all the rest.

<span id="fn_2829"></span>[336:2830](0010711.htm#fr_2829.md) <span

<span id="ix.ii.xv-p5"></span> The letters are here confounded with the

<span id="ix.ii.xv-p13"></span> The old Latin version renders <span
class="Greek"><span id="ix.ii.xv-p13.1"></span>ἐπίσημον</span>,
*insigne, illustrious*, but there seems to be a reference to the
Valentinian notion of the mystic number of 888 formed
(10+8+200+70+400+200) by the numerical value of the letters in the word

thus: “And because they receive the outflow of those above, but the
