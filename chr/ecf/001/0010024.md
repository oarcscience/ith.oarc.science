### <span id="ii.ii.xix-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIX.—Imitating these examples, let us seek after peace.

<span id="ii.ii.xix-p1"></span><span id="ii.ii.xix-p1.1"></span>Thus the
humility and godly submission of so great and illustrious men have
rendered not only us, but also all the generations before us, better;
even as many as have received His oracles in fear and truth. <span
id="ii.ii.xix-p1.2"></span>Wherefore, having so many great and glorious
examples set before us, let us turn again to the practice of that peace
which from the beginning was the mark set before us; <span
id="fr_85"></span>[86](#fn_85.md) and let us look stedfastly to the Father
and Creator of the universe, and cleave to His mighty and surpassingly
great gifts and benefactions, of peace. Let us contemplate Him with our
understanding, and look with the eyes of our soul to His long-suffering
will. Let us reflect how free from wrath He is towards all His creation.
