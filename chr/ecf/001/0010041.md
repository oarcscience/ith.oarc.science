### <span id="ii.ii.xxxvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXVI.—All blessings are given to us through Christ.

<span id="ii.ii.xxxvi-p1"></span><span
id="ii.ii.xxxvi-p1.1"></span><span id="ii.ii.xxxvi-p1.2"></span><span
id="ii.ii.xxxvi-p1.3"></span>This is the way, beloved, in which we find
our Saviour, <span id="fr_152"></span>[153](#fn_152) even Jesus Christ,
the High Priest of all our offerings, the defender and helper of our
infirmity. By Him we look up to the heights of heaven. By Him we behold,
as in a glass, His immaculate and most excellent visage. By Him are the
eyes of our hearts opened. By Him our foolish and darkened understanding
blossoms <span id="fr_153"></span>[154](#fn_153) up anew towards His
marvellous light. By Him the Lord has willed that we should taste of
immortal <span id="page_15">p. 15</span> <span
id="ii.ii.xxxvi-Page_15"></span> knowledge, <span
id="fr_154"></span>[155](#fn_154) “who, being the brightness of His
majesty, is by so much greater than the angels, as He hath by
inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.” <span
id="fr_155"></span>[156](#fn_155) For it is thus written, “Who maketh
His angels spirits, and His ministers a flame of fire.” <span
id="fr_156"></span>[157](#fn_156) But concerning His Son <span
id="fr_157"></span>[158](#fn_157) the Lord spoke thus: “Thou art my Son,
to-day have I begotten Thee. Ask of Me, and I will give Thee the heathen
for Thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for Thy
possession.” <span id="fr_158"></span>[159](#fn_158) And again He saith
to Him, “Sit Thou at My right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy
footstool.” <span id="fr_159"></span>[160](#fn_159) But who are His
enemies? All the wicked, and those who set themselves to oppose the will
of God. <span id="fr_160"></span>[161](#fn_160)
