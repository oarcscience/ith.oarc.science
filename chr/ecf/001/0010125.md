### <span id="v.ii.ii-p0.1"></span>Chapter II.—Congratulations and entreaties.

<span id="v.ii.ii-p1"></span><span id="v.ii.ii-p1.1"></span><span
id="v.ii.ii-p1.2"></span>As to my fellow-servant Burrhus, your deacon in
regard to God and blessed in all things, <span
id="fr_500"></span>[501](#fn_500.md) I beg that he may continue longer,
both for your honour and that of your bishop. <span
id="v.ii.ii-p2.1"></span>And Crocus also, worthy both of God and you,
whom I have received as the manifestation <span
id="fr_501"></span>[502](#fn_501.md) of your love, hath in all things
refreshed <span id="fr_502"></span>[503](#fn_502.md) me, as the Father of
our Lord Jesus Christ shall also refresh <span
id="fr_503"></span>[504](#fn_503.md) him; together with Onesimus, and
Burrhus, and Euplus, and Fronto, by means of whom, I have, as to love,
beheld all of you. May I always have joy of you, if indeed I be worthy
of it. <span id="v.ii.ii-p5.2"></span><span id="v.ii.ii-p5.3"></span>It
is therefore befitting that you should in every way glorify Jesus
Christ, who hath glorified you, that by a unanimous obedience “ye may be
perfectly joined together in the same mind, and in the same judgment,
and may all speak the same thing concerning the same thing,” <span
id="fr_504"></span>[505](#fn_504.md) and that, being subject to the bishop
and the presbytery, ye may in all respects be sanctified.

<span id="v.ii.ii-p7"></span><span id="v.ii.ii-p7.1"></span>As to our
fellow-servant Burrhus, your deacon in regard to God and blessed in all
things, I pray that he may continue blameless for the honour of the
Church, and of your most blessed bishop. <span
id="v.ii.ii-p7.2"></span>Crocus also, worthy both of God and you, whom
we have received as the manifestation <span
id="fr_505"></span>[506](#fn_505.md) of your love to us, hath in all things
refreshed <span id="fr_506"></span>[507](#fn_506.md) me, and “hath not been
ashamed of my chain,” <span id="fr_507"></span>[508](#fn_507.md) as the
Father of our Lord Jesus Christ will also refresh <span
id="fr_508"></span>[509](#fn_508.md) him; together with Onesimus, and
Burrhus, and Euplus, and Fronto, by means of whom I have, as to love,
beheld all of you. May I always have joy of you, if indeed I be worthy
of it. <span id="v.ii.ii-p11.2"></span><span
id="v.ii.ii-p11.3"></span>It is therefore befitting that you should in
every way glorify Jesus Christ, who hath glorified you, that by a
unanimous obedience “ye may be perfectly joined together in the same
mind and in the same judgment, and may all speak the same thing
concerning the same thing,” <span id="fr_509"></span>[510](#fn_509.md) and
that, being subject to the bishop and the presbytery, ye may in all
respects be sanctified.
