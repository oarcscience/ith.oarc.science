### <span id="vii.ii.v-p0.1"></span>V. <span id="fr_1746"></span>[1747](#fn_1746.md)

<span id="vii.ii.v-p2"></span><span id="vii.ii.v-p2.1"></span>As the
presbyters say, then <span id="fr_1747"></span>[1748](#fn_1747.md) those
who are deemed worthy of an abode in heaven shall go there, others shall
enjoy the delights of Paradise, and others shall possess the splendour
of the city; <span id="fr_1748"></span>[1749](#fn_1748.md) for everywhere
the Saviour will be seen, according as they shall be worthy who see Him.
But that there is this distinction between the habitation of those who
produce an hundred-fold, and that of those who produce sixty-fold, and
that of those who produce thirty-fold; for the first will be taken up
into the heavens, the second class will dwell in Paradise, and the last
will inhabit the city; and that on this account the Lord said, “In my
Father’s house are many mansions:” <span
id="fr_1749"></span>[1750](#fn_1749.md) for all things belong to God, who
supplies all with a suitable dwelling-place, even as His word says, that
a share is given to all by the Father, <span
id="fr_1750"></span>[1751](#fn_1750.md) according as each one is or shall
be worthy. And this is the couch <span
id="fr_1751"></span>[1752](#fn_1751.md) in which they shall recline who
feast, being invited to the wedding. The presbyters, the disciples of
the apostles, say that this is the gradation and arrangement of those
who are saved, and that they advance through steps of this nature; and
that, moreover, they ascend through the Spirit to the Son, and through
the Son to the Father; and that in due time the Son will yield up His
work to the Father, even as it is said by the apostle, “For He must
reign till He hath put all enemies under His feet. The last enemy that
shall be destroyed is death.” <span id="fr_1752"></span>[1753](#fn_1752.md)
For in the times of the kingdom the just man who is on the earth shall
forget to die. “But when He saith all things are put under Him, it is
manifest that He is excepted which did put all things under Him. And
when all things shall be subdued unto Him, then shall the Son also
Himself be subject unto Him that put all things under Him, that God may
be all in all.” <span id="fr_1753"></span>[1754](#fn_1753.md)
