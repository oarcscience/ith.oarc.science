### <span id="viii.iv.cxxiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter CXXIII.—Ridiculous interpretations of the Jews. Christians are the true Israel.

<span id="viii.iv.cxxiii-p1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.cxxiii-p1.1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.cxxiii-p1.2"></span>“As, therefore, all these latter
prophecies refer to Christ and the nations, you should believe that the
former refer to Him and them in like manner. For the proselytes have no
need of a covenant, if, since there is one and the same law imposed on
all that are circumcised, the Scripture speaks about them thus: ‘And the
stranger shall also be joined with them, and shall be joined to the
house of Jacob;’ <span id="fr_2422"></span>[2423](#fn_2422.md) and because
the proselyte, who is circumcised that he may have access to the people,
becomes like one of themselves, <span
id="fr_2423"></span>[2424](#fn_2423.md) while we who have been deemed
worthy to be called a people are yet Gentiles, because we have not been
circumcised. Besides, it is ridiculous for you to imagine that the eyes
of the proselytes are to be opened while your own are not, and that you
be understood as blind and deaf while they are enlightened. And it will
be still more ridiculous for you, if you say that the law has been given
to the nations, but you have not known it. For you would have stood in
awe of God’s wrath, and would not have been lawless, wandering sons;
being much afraid of hearing God always say, ‘Children in whom is no
faith. And who are blind, but my servants? and deaf, but they that rule
over them? And the servants of God have been made blind. You see often,
but have not observed; your ears have been opened, and you have not
heard.’ <span id="fr_2424"></span>[2425](#fn_2424.md) Is God’s commendation
of you honourable? and is God’s testimony seemly for His servants? You
are not ashamed though you often hear these words. You do not tremble at
God’s threats, for you are a people foolish and hard-hearted.
‘Therefore, behold, I will proceed to remove this people,’ saith the
Lord; ‘and I will remove them, and destroy the wisdom of the wise, and
hide the understanding of the prudent.’ <span
id="fr_2425"></span>[2426](#fn_2425.md) Deservedly too: for you are neither
wise nor prudent, but crafty and unscrupulous; wise only to do evil, but
utterly incompetent to know the hidden counsel of God, or the faithful
covenant of the Lord, or to find out the everlasting paths. ‘Therefore,
saith the Lord, I will raise up to Israel and to Judah the seed of men
and the seed of beasts.’ <span id="fr_2426"></span>[2427](#fn_2426.md) And
by Isaiah He speaks thus concerning another Israel: ‘In that day shall
there be a third Israel among the Assyrians and the Egyptians, blessed
in the land which the Lord of Sabaoth hath blessed, saying, blessed
shall my people in Egypt and in Assyria be, and Israel mine
inheritance.’ <span id="fr_2427"></span>[2428](#fn_2427.md) Since then God
blesses this people, and calls them Israel, and declares them to be His
inheritance, how is it that you repent not of the deception you practise
on yourselves, as if you alone were the Israel, and of execrating the
people whom God has blessed? For when He speaks to Jerusalem and its
environs, He thus added: ‘And I will beget men upon you, even my people
Israel; and they shall inherit you, and you shall be a possession for
them; and you shall be no longer bereaved of them.’ ” <span
id="fr_2428"></span>[2429](#fn_2428.md)

<span id="viii.iv.cxxiii-p9"></span>“What, then?” says Trypho; “are you
Israel? and speaks He such things of you?”

<span id="viii.iv.cxxiii-p10"></span>“If, indeed,” I replied to him, “we
had not entered into a lengthy <span
id="fr_2429"></span>[2430](#fn_2429.md) discussion on these topics, I might
have doubted whether you ask this question in ignorance; but since we
have brought the matter to a conclusion by demonstration and with your
assent, I do not believe that you are ignorant of what I have just said,
or desire again mere contention, but that you are urging me to exhibit
the same proof to these men.” And in compliance with the assent
expressed in his eyes, I continued: “Again in Isaiah, if you have ears
to hear it, God, speaking of Christ in parable, calls Him Jacob and
Israel. He speaks thus: ‘Jacob is my servant, I will uphold Him; Israel
is mine elect, I will put my Spirit upon Him, and He shall bring forth
judgment to the Gentiles. He shall not strive, nor cry, neither shall
any one hear His voice in the street: a bruised reed He shall not break,
and smoking flax He shall not quench; but He shall bring forth judgment
to truth: He shall shine, <span id="fr_2430"></span>[2431](#fn_2430.md) and
shall not be broken till He have set judgment on the earth. And in His
name shall the Gentiles trust.’ <span
id="fr_2431"></span>[2432](#fn_2431.md) As therefore from the one man
Jacob, who was surnamed Israel, all your nation has been called Jacob
and Israel; so we from Christ, who begat us unto God, like Jacob, and
Israel, and Judah, and Joseph, and David, are called and are the true
sons of God, and keep the commandments of Christ.”
