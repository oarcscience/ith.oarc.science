### <span id="viii.iv.liv-p0.1"></span>Chapter LIV.—What the blood of the grape signifies.

<span id="viii.iv.liv-p1"></span><span
id="viii.iv.liv-p1.1"></span><span id="viii.iv.liv-p1.2"></span>“And
that expression which was committed to writing <span
id="fr_2117"></span>[2118](#fn_2117.md) by Moses, and prophesied by the
patriarch Jacob, namely, ‘He shall wash His garments with wine, and His
vesture with the blood of the grape,’ signified that He would wash those
that believe in Him with His own blood. For the Holy Spirit called those
who receive remission of sins through Him, His garments; amongst whom He
is always present in power, but will be manifestly present at His second
coming. That the Scripture mentions the blood of the grape has been
evidently designed, because Christ derives blood not from the seed of
man, but from the power of God. For as God, and not man, has produced
the blood of the vine, so also \[the Scripture\] has predicted that the
blood of Christ would be not of the seed of man, but of the power of
God. But this prophecy, sirs, which I repeated, proves that Christ is
not man of men, begotten in the ordinary course of humanity.”
