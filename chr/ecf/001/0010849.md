### <span id="ix.vii.xii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XI.—Treats upon the actions of carnal and of spiritual persons; also, that the spiritual cleansing is not to be referred to the substance of our bodies, but to the manner of our former life.

<span id="ix.vii.xii-p1"></span>1. <span
id="ix.vii.xii-p1.1"></span>\[The apostle\], foreseeing the wicked
speeches of unbelievers, has particularized the <span id="page_537">p.
537</span> <span id="ix.vii.xii-Page_537"></span> works which he terms
carnal; and he explains himself, lest any room for doubt be left to
those who do dishonestly pervert his meaning, thus saying in the Epistle
to the Galatians: “Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are
adulteries, fornications, uncleanness, luxuriousness, idolatries,
witchcrafts, <span id="fr_4525"></span>[4526](#fn_4525.md) hatreds,
contentions jealousies, wraths, emulations, animosities, irritable
speeches, dissensions, heresies, envyings, drunkenness, carousings, and
such like; of which I warn you, as also I have warned you, that they who
do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.” <span
id="fr_4526"></span>[4527](#fn_4526.md) Thus does he point out to his
hearers in a more explicit manner what it is \[he means when he
declares\], “Flesh and blood shall not inherit the kingdom of God.” For
they who do these things, since they do indeed walk after the flesh,
have not the power of living unto God. And then, again, he proceeds to
tell us the spiritual actions which vivify a man, that is, the
engrafting of the Spirit; thus saying, “But the fruit of the Spirit is
love, joy, peace, long-suffering, goodness, benignity, faith, meekness,
continence, chastity: against these there is no law.” <span
id="fr_4527"></span>[4528](#fn_4527.md) As, therefore, he who has gone
forward to the better things, and has brought forth the fruit of the
Spirit, is saved altogether because of the communion of the Spirit; so
also he who has continued in the aforesaid works of the flesh, being
truly reckoned as carnal, because he did not receive the Spirit of God,
shall not have power to inherit the kingdom of heaven. As, again, the
same apostle testifies, saying to the Corinthians, “Know ye not that the
unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not err,” he says:
“neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor
abusers of themselves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor
revilers, nor rapacious persons, shall inherit the kingdom of God. And
these ye indeed have been; but ye have been washed, but ye have been
sanctified, but ye have been justified in the name of the Lord Jesus
Christ, and in the Spirit of our God.” <span
id="fr_4528"></span>[4529](#fn_4528.md) He shows in the clearest manner
through what things it is that man goes to destruction, if he has
continued to live after the flesh; and then, on the other hand, \[he
points out\] through what things he is saved. Now he says that the
things which save are the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the Spirit
of our God.

<span id="ix.vii.xii-p6"></span>2. Since, therefore, in that passage he
recounts those works of the flesh which are without the Spirit, which
bring death \[upon their doers\], he exclaimed at the end of his
Epistle, in accordance with what he had already declared, “And as we
have borne the image of him who is of the earth, we shall also bear the
image of Him who is from heaven. For this I say, brethren, that flesh
and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God.” <span
id="fr_4529"></span>[4530](#fn_4529.md) Now this which he says, “as we have
borne the image of him who is of the earth,” is analogous to what has
been declared, “And such indeed ye were; but ye have been washed, but ye
have been sanctified, but ye have been justified in the name of our Lord
Jesus Christ, and in the Spirit of our God.” When, therefore, did we
bear the image of him who is of the earth? Doubtless it was when those
actions spoken of as “works of the flesh” used to be wrought in us. And
then, again, when \[do we bear\] the image of the heavenly? Doubtless
when he says, “Ye have been washed,” believing in the name of the Lord,
and receiving His Spirit. Now we have washed away, not the substance of
our body, nor the image of our \[primary\] formation, but the former
vain conversation. In these members, therefore, in which we were going
to destruction by working the works of corruption, in these very members
are we made alive by working the works of the Spirit.
