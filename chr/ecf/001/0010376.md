### <span id="viii.ii.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.—Claim of judicial investigation.

<span id="viii.ii.iii-p1"></span>But lest any one think that this is an
unreasonable and reckless utterance, we demand that the charges against
the Christians be investigated, and that, if these be substantiated,
they be punished as they deserve; \[or rather, indeed, we ourselves will
punish them.\] <span id="fr_1768"></span>[1769](#fn_1768) But if no one
can convict us of anything, true reason forbids you, for the sake of a
wicked rumour, to wrong blameless men, and indeed rather yourselves, who
think fit to direct affairs, not by judgment, but by passion. And every
sober-minded person will declare this to be the only fair and equitable
adjustment, namely, that the subjects render an unexceptional account of
their own life and doctrine; and that, on the other hand, the rulers
should give their decision in obedience, not to violence and tyranny,
but to piety and philosophy. For thus would both rulers and ruled reap
benefit. For even one of the ancients somewhere said, “Unless both
rulers and ruled philosophize, it is impossible to make states
blessed.” <span id="fr_1769"></span>[1770](#fn_1769) It is our task,
therefore, to afford to all an opportunity of inspecting our life and
teachings, lest, on account of those who are accustomed to be ignorant
of our affairs, we should incur the penalty due to them for mental
blindness; <span id="fr_1770"></span>[1771](#fn_1770) and it is your
business, when you hear us, to be found, as reason demands, good judges.
For if, when ye have learned the truth, you do not what is just, you
will be before God without excuse.

<span id="viii.ii.iii-p2"></span> Thirlby regarded the clause in
brackets as an interpolation. There is considerable variety of opinion
as to the exact meaning of the words amongst those who regard them as
genuine.

<span id="viii.ii.iii-p4"></span> That is to say, if the Christians
refused or neglected to make their real opinions and practices known,
they would share the guilt of those whom they thus kept in darkness.
