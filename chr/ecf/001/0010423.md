### <span id="viii.ii.l-p0.1"></span>Chapter L.—His humiliation predicted.

<span id="viii.ii.l-p1"></span><span id="viii.ii.l-p1.1"></span><span
id="viii.ii.l-p1.2"></span><span id="viii.ii.l-p1.3"></span>But that,
having become man for our sakes, He endured to suffer and to be
dishonoured, and that He shall come again with glory, hear the
prophecies which relate to this; they are these: “Because they delivered
His soul unto death, and He was numbered with the transgressors, He has
borne the sin of many, and shall make intercession for the
transgressors. For, behold, My Servant shall deal prudently, and shall
be exalted, and shall be greatly extolled. As many were astonished at
Thee, so marred shall Thy form be before men, and so hidden from them
Thy glory; so shall many nations wonder, and the kings shall shut their
mouths at Him. For they to whom it was not told concerning Him, and they
who have not heard, shall understand. O Lord, who hath believed our
report? and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? We have declared
before Him as a child, as a root in a dry ground. He had no form, nor
glory; and we saw Him, and there was no form nor comeliness: but His
form was dishonoured and marred more than the sons of men. A man under
the stroke, and knowing how to bear infirmity, because His face was
turned away: He was despised, and of no reputation. It is He who bears
our sins, and is afflicted for us; yet we did esteem Him smitten,
stricken, and afflicted. But He was wounded for our transgressions, He
was bruised for our iniquities, the chastisement of peace was upon Him,
by His stripes we are healed. All we, like sheep, have gone astray;
every man has wandered in his own way. And He delivered Him for our
sins; and He opened not His mouth for all His affliction. He was brought
as a sheep to the slaughter, and as a lamb before his shearer is dumb,
so He openeth not His mouth. In His humiliation, His judgment was taken
away.” <span id="fr_1870"></span>[1871](#fn_1870.md) Accordingly, after He
was crucified, even all His acquaintances forsook Him, having denied
Him; and afterwards, when He had risen from the dead and appeared to
them, and had taught them to read the prophecies in which all these
things were foretold as coming to pass, and when they had seen Him
ascending into heaven, and had believed, and had received power sent
thence by Him upon them, and went to every race of men, they taught
these things, and were called apostles.
