### <span id="v.vi.ix-p0.1"></span>Chapter IX.—The Old Testament is good: the New Testament is better.

<span id="v.vi.ix-p1"></span><span id="v.vi.ix-p1.1"></span>The
priests <span id="fr_953"></span>[954](#fn_953.md) indeed are good, but the
High Priest is better; to whom the holy of holies has been committed,
and who alone has been trusted with the secrets of God. He is the door
of the Father, by which enter in Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and the
prophets, and the apostles, and the Church. All these have for their
object the attaining to the unity of God. <span
id="v.vi.ix-p2.1"></span>But the Gospel possesses something transcendent
\[above the former dispensation\], viz., the appearance of our Lord
Jesus Christ, His passion and resurrection. For the beloved prophets
announced Him, <span id="fr_954"></span>[955](#fn_954.md) but the Gospel is
the perfection of immortality. <span id="fr_955"></span>[956](#fn_955.md)
All these things are good together, if ye believe in love.

<span id="v.vi.ix-p5"></span><span id="v.vi.ix-p5.1"></span>The
priests <span id="fr_956"></span>[957](#fn_956.md) indeed, and the
ministers of the word, are good; but the High Priest is better, to whom
the holy of holies has been committed, and who alone has been entrusted
with the secrets of God. The ministering powers of God are good. <span
id="v.vi.ix-p6.1"></span>The Comforter is holy, and the Word is holy,
the Son of the Father, by whom He made all things, and exercises a
providence over them all. <span id="v.vi.ix-p6.2"></span>This is the
Way <span id="fr_957"></span>[958](#fn_957.md) which leads to the Father,
the Rock, <span id="fr_958"></span>[959](#fn_958.md) the Defence, <span
id="fr_959"></span>[960](#fn_959.md) the Key, the Shepherd, <span
id="fr_960"></span>[961](#fn_960.md) the Sacrifice, the Door <span
id="fr_961"></span>[962](#fn_961.md) of knowledge, through which have
entered Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, Moses and all the company of the
prophets, and these pillars of the world, the apostles, and the spouse
of Christ, on whose account He poured out His own blood, as her marriage
portion, that He might redeem her. All these things tend towards the
unity of the one and only true God. <span id="v.vi.ix-p11.2"></span>But
the Gospel possesses something transcendent \[above the former
dispensation\], viz. the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, His
passion, and the resurrection itself. <span
id="v.vi.ix-p11.3"></span>For those things which the prophets announced,
saying, “Until He come for whom it is reserved, and He shall be the
expectation of the Gentiles,” <span id="fr_962"></span>[963](#fn_962.md)
have been fulfilled in the Gospel, \[our Lord saying,\] “Go ye and teach
all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son,
and of the Holy Ghost.” <span id="fr_963"></span>[964](#fn_963.md) All then
are good together, the law, the prophets, the apostles, the whole
company \[of others\] that have believed through them: only if we love
one another.
