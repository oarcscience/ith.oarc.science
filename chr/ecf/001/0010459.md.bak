### <span id="viii.iii.xiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIV.—Justin prays that this appeal be published.

<span id="viii.iii.xiv-p1"></span>And we therefore pray you to publish
this little book, appending what you think right, that our opinions may
he known to others, and that these persons may have a fair chalice of
being freed from erroneous notions and ignorance of good, who by their
own fault are become subject to punishment; that so these things may be
published to men, because it is in the nature of man to know good and
evil; and by their condemning us, whom they do not understand, for
actions which they say are wicked, and by delighting in the gods who did
such things, and even now require similar actions from men, and by
inflicting on us death or bonds or some other such punishment, as if we
were guilty of these things, they condemn themselves, so that there is
no need of other judges.
