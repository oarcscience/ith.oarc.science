### <span id="v.ii.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.—The praise of unity.

<span id="v.ii.v-p1"></span><span id="v.ii.v-p1.1"></span>For if I in
this brief space of time, have enjoyed such fellowship with your bishop
—I mean not of a mere human, but of a spiritual nature—how much more do
I reckon you happy who are so joined to him as the Church is to Jesus
Christ, and as Jesus Christ is to the Father, that so all things may
agree in unity! Let no man deceive himself: if any one be not within the
altar, he is deprived of the bread of God. For if the prayer of one or
two possesses <span id="fr_517"></span>[518](#fn_517) such power, how
much more that of the bishop and the whole Church! He, therefore, that
does not assemble with the Church, has even <span
id="fr_518"></span>[519](#fn_518) by this manifested his pride, and
condemned himself. For it is written, “God resisteth the proud.” <span
id="fr_519"></span>[520](#fn_519) Let us be careful, then, not to set
ourselves in opposition to the bishop, in order that we may be subject
to God.

<span id="v.ii.v-p5"></span><span id="v.ii.v-p5.1"></span>For if I, in
this brief space of time, have enjoyed such fellowship with your bishop
—I mean not of a mere human, but of a spiritual nature—how much more do
I reckon you happy, who so depend <span
id="fr_520"></span>[521](#fn_520) on him as the Church does on the Lord
Jesus, and the Lord does on God and His Father, that so all things may
agree in unity! Let no man deceive himself: if any one be not within the
altar, he is deprived of the bread of God. For if the prayer of one or
two possesses <span id="fr_521"></span>[522](#fn_521) such power that
Christ stands in the midst of them, how much more will the prayer of the
bishop and of the whole Church, ascending up in harmony to God, prevail
for the granting of all their petitions in Christ! He, therefore, that
separates himself from such, and does not meet in the society where
sacrifices <span id="fr_522"></span>[523](#fn_522) are offered, and with
“the Church of the first-born whose names are written in heaven,” is a
wolf in sheep’s clothing, <span id="fr_523"></span>[524](#fn_523) while
he presents a mild outward appearance. <span id="v.ii.v-p9.2"></span>Do
ye, beloved, be careful to be subject to the bishop, and the presbyters
and the deacons. <span id="v.ii.v-p9.3"></span>For he that is subject to
these is obedient to Christ, who has appointed them; but he that is
disobedient to these is disobedient to Christ Jesus. And “he that
obeyeth not <span id="fr_524"></span>[525](#fn_524) the Son shall not
see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.” For he that yields not
obedience to his superiors is self-confident, quarrelsome, and proud.
But “God,” says \[the Scripture\] “resisteth the proud, but giveth grace
to the humble;” <span id="fr_525"></span>[526](#fn_525) and, “The proud
have greatly transgressed.” The Lord also says to the priests, “He that
heareth you, heareth Me; and he that heareth Me, heareth the Father that
sent Me. He that despiseth you, despiseth Me; and he that despiseth Me,
despiseth Him that sent Me.”
