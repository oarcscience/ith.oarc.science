### <span id="iv.iv.ii-p0.1"></span>Chapter II.—The wonderful constancy of the martyrs.

<span id="iv.iv.ii-p1"></span><span id="iv.iv.ii-p1.1"></span>All the
martyrdoms, then, were blessed and noble which took place according to
the will of God. For it becomes us who profess <span
id="fr_421"></span>[422](#fn_421.md) greater piety than others, to ascribe
the authority over all things to God. And truly, <span
id="fr_422"></span>[423](#fn_422.md) who can fail to admire their nobleness
of mind, and their patience, with that love towards their Lord which
they displayed?—who, when they were so torn with scourges, that the
frame of their bodies, even to the very inward veins and arteries, was
laid open, still patiently endured, while even those that stood by
pitied and bewailed them. But they reached such a pitch of magnanimity,
that not one of them let a sigh or a groan escape them; thus proving to
us all that those holy martyrs of Christ, at the very time when they
suffered such torments, were absent from the body, or rather, that the
Lord then stood by them, and communed with them. And, looking to the
grace of Christ, they despised all the torments of this world, redeeming
themselves from eternal punishment by \[the suffering of\] a single
hour. For this reason the fire of their savage executioners appeared
cool to them. For they kept before their view escape from that fire
which is eternal and never shall be quenched, and looked forward with
the eyes of their heart to those good things which are laid up for such
as endure; things “which ear hath not heard, nor eye seen, neither have
entered into the heart of man,” <span id="fr_423"></span>[424](#fn_423.md)
but were revealed by the Lord to them, inasmuch as they were no longer
men, but had already become angels. And, in like manner, those who were
condemned to the wild beasts endured dreadful tortures, being stretched
out upon beds full of spikes, and subjected to various other kinds of
torments, in order that, if it were possible, the tyrant might, by their
lingering tortures, lead them to a denial \[of Christ\].
