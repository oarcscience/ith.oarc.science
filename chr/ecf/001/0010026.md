### <span id="ii.ii.xxi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXI.—Let us obey God, and not the authors of sedition.

<span id="ii.ii.xxi-p1"></span><span id="ii.ii.xxi-p1.1"></span><span
id="ii.ii.xxi-p1.2"></span>Take heed, beloved, lest His many kindnesses
lead to the condemnation of us all. \[For thus it must be\] unless we
walk worthy of Him, and with one mind do those things which are good and
well-pleasing in His sight. <span id="ii.ii.xxi-p1.3"></span>For \[the
Scripture\] saith in a certain place, “The Spirit of the Lord is a
candle searching the secret parts of the belly.” <span
id="fr_89"></span>[90](#fn_89.md) Let us reflect how near He is, and that
none of the thoughts or reasonings in which we engage are hid from Him.
It is right, therefore, that we should not leave the post which His will
has assigned us. <span id="ii.ii.xxi-p2.2"></span><span
id="ii.ii.xxi-p2.3"></span>Let us rather offend those men who are
foolish, and inconsiderate, and lifted up, and who glory in the pride of
their speech, than \[offend\] God. Let us reverence the Lord Jesus
Christ, whose blood was given for us; let us esteem those who have the
rule over us; <span id="fr_90"></span>[91](#fn_90.md) let us honour the
aged <span id="fr_91"></span>[92](#fn_91.md) among us; let us train up the
young men in the fear of God; let us direct our wives to that which is
good. Let them exhibit the lovely habit of purity \[in all their
conduct\]; let them show forth the sincere disposition of meekness; let
them make manifest the command which they have of their tongue, by their
manner <span id="fr_92"></span>[93](#fn_92.md) of speaking; let them
display their love, not by preferring <span
id="fr_93"></span>[94](#fn_93.md) one to another, but by showing equal
affection to all that piously fear God. Let your children be partakers
of true Christian training; let them learn of how great avail humility
is with God—how much the spirit of pure affection can prevail with
Him—how excellent and great His fear is, and how it saves all those who
walk in <span id="fr_94"></span>[95](#fn_94.md) it with a pure mind. For He
is a Searcher of the thoughts and desires \[of the heart\]: His breath
is in us; and when He pleases, He will take it away.
