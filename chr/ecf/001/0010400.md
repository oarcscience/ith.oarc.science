### <span id="viii.ii.xxvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXVII.—Guilt of exposing children.

<span id="viii.ii.xxvii-p1"></span><span
id="viii.ii.xxvii-p1.1"></span>But as for us, we have been taught that
to expose newly-born children is the part of wicked men; and this we
have been taught lest we should do any one an injury, and lest we should
sin against God, first, because we see that almost all so exposed (not
only the girls, but also the males) are brought up to prostitution. And
as the ancients are said to have reared herds of oxen, or goats, or
sheep, or grazing horses, so now we see you rear children only for this
shameful use; and for this pollution a multitude of females and
hermaphrodites, and those who commit unmentionable iniquities, are found
in every nation. And you receive the hire of these, and duty and taxes
from them, whom you ought to exterminate from your realm. And any one
who uses such persons, besides the godless and infamous and impure
intercourse, may possibly be having intercourse with his own child, or
relative, or brother. And there are some who prostitute even their own
children and wives, and some are openly mutilated for the purpose of
sodomy; and they refer these mysteries to the mother of the gods, and
along with each of those whom you esteem gods there is painted a
serpent, <span id="fr_1820"></span>[1821](#fn_1820.md) a great symbol and
mystery. Indeed, the things <span id="fr_1821"></span>[1822](#fn_1821.md)
which you do openly and with applause, as if the divine light were
overturned and extinguished, these you lay to our charge; which, in
truth, does no harm to us who shrink from doing any such things, but
only to those who do them and bear false witness against us.

<span id="viii.ii.xxvii-p2"></span> Thirlby remarks that the serpent was
the symbol specially of eternity, of power, and of wisdom, and that
there was scarcely any divine attribute to which the heathen did not
find some likeness in this animal. See also Hardwick’s *Christ and other
Masters*, vol. ii. 146 (2d ed.).

calumny (cap. xxvi.) of the “upsetting of the lamp.”\]
