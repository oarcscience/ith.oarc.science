### <span id="viii.iv.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.—Justin narrates the manner of his conversion.

<span id="viii.iv.iii-p1"></span><span id="viii.iv.iii-p1.1"></span>“And
while I was thus disposed, when I wished at one period to be filled with
great quietness, and to shun the path of men, I used to go into a
certain field not far from the sea. And when I was near that spot one
day, which having reached I purposed to be by myself, a certain old man,
by no means contemptible in appearance, exhibiting meek and venerable
manners, followed me at a little distance. And when I turned round to
him, having halted, I fixed my eyes rather keenly on him.

<span id="viii.iv.iii-p2"></span>“And he said, ‘Do you know me?’

<span id="viii.iv.iii-p3"></span>“I replied in the negative.

<span id="viii.iv.iii-p4"></span>“ ‘Why, then,’ said he to me, ‘do you
so look at me?’

<span id="viii.iv.iii-p5"></span>“ ‘I am astonished,’ I said, ‘because
you have chanced to be in my company in the same place; for I had not
expected to see any man here.’

<span id="viii.iv.iii-p6"></span>“And he says to me, ‘I am concerned
about some of my household. These are gone away from me; and therefore
have I come to make personal search for them, if, perhaps, they shall
make their appearance somewhere. But why are you here?’ said he to me.

<span id="viii.iv.iii-p7"></span>“ ‘I delight,’ said I, ‘in such walks,
where my attention is not distracted, for converse with myself is
uninterrupted; and such places are most fit for philology.’ <span
id="fr_1959"></span>[1960](#fn_1959.md)

<span id="viii.iv.iii-p9"></span>“ ‘Are you, then, a philologian,’ <span
id="fr_1960"></span>[1961](#fn_1960.md) said he, ‘but <span
id="page_196">p. 196</span> <span id="viii.iv.iii-Page_196"></span> no
lover of deeds or of truth? and do you not aim at being a practical man
so much as being a sophist?’

<span id="viii.iv.iii-p11"></span>“ ‘What greater work,’ said I, ‘could
one accomplish than this, to show the reason which governs all, and
having laid hold of it, and being mounted upon it, to look down on the
errors of others, and their pursuits? But without philosophy and right
reason, prudence would not be present to any man. Wherefore it is
necessary for every man to philosophize, and to esteem this the greatest
and most honourable work; but other things only of second-rate or
third-rate importance, though, indeed, if they be made to depend on
philosophy, they are of moderate value, and worthy of acceptance; but
deprived of it, and not accompanying it, they are vulgar and coarse to
those who pursue them.’

<span id="viii.iv.iii-p12"></span><span id="viii.iv.iii-p12.1"></span>“
‘Does philosophy, then, make happiness?’ said he, interrupting.

<span id="viii.iv.iii-p13"></span>“ ‘Assuredly,’ I said, ‘and it alone.’

<span id="viii.iv.iii-p14"></span>“ ‘What, then, is philosophy?’ he
says; ‘and what is happiness? Pray tell me, unless something hinders you
from saying.’

<span id="viii.iv.iii-p15"></span><span id="viii.iv.iii-p15.1"></span>“
‘Philosophy, then,’ said I, ‘is the knowledge of that which really
exists, and a clear perception of the truth; and happiness is the reward
of such knowledge and wisdom.’

<span id="viii.iv.iii-p16"></span>“ ‘But what do you call God?’ said he.

<span id="viii.iv.iii-p17"></span>“ ‘That which always maintains the
same nature, and in the same manner, and is the cause of all other
things —that, indeed, is God.’ So I answered him; and he listened to me
with pleasure, and thus again interrogated me:—

<span id="viii.iv.iii-p18"></span>“ ‘Is not knowledge a term common to
different matters? For in arts of all kinds, he who knows any one of
them is called a skilful man in the art of generalship, or of ruling, or
of healing equally. But in divine and human affairs it is not so. Is
there a knowledge which affords understanding of human and divine
things, and then a thorough acquaintance with the divinity and the
righteousness of them?’

<span id="viii.iv.iii-p19"></span>“ ‘Assuredly,’ I replied.

<span id="viii.iv.iii-p20"></span>“ ‘What, then? <span
id="viii.iv.iii-p20.1"></span>Is it in the same way we know man and God,
as we know music, and arithmetic, and astronomy, or any other similar
branch?’

<span id="viii.iv.iii-p21"></span>“ ‘By no means,’ I replied.

<span id="viii.iv.iii-p22"></span>“ ‘You have not answered me correctly,
then,’ he said; ‘for some \[branches of knowledge\] come to us by
learning, or by some employment, while of others we have knowledge by
sight. Now, if one were to tell you that there exists in India an animal
with a nature unlike all others, but of such and such a kind, multiform
and various, you would not know it before you saw it; but neither would
you be competent to give any account of it, unless you should hear from
one who had seen it.’

<span id="viii.iv.iii-p23"></span>“ ‘Certainly not,’ I said.

<span id="viii.iv.iii-p24"></span>“ ‘How then,’ he said, ‘should the
philosophers judge correctly about God, or speak any truth, when they
have no knowledge of Him, having neither seen Him at any time, nor heard
Him?’

<span id="viii.iv.iii-p25"></span>“ ‘But, father,’ said I, ‘the Deity
cannot be seen merely by the eyes, as other living beings can, but is
discernible to the mind alone, as Plato says; and I believe him.’

<span id="viii.iv.iii-p8"></span> Philology, used here to denote the
exercise of *reason*.

<span id="viii.iv.iii-p10"></span> Philology, used her to denote the
exercise of *speech*. The two-fold use of <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.iv.iii-p10.1"></span>λόγος</span>— *oratio* and *ratio*—ought
to be kept in view. The old man uses it in the former, Justin in the
latter, sense.
