### <span id="viii.ii.lxiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter LXIV.—Further misrepresentations of the truth.

<span id="viii.ii.lxiv-p1"></span><span
id="viii.ii.lxiv-p1.1"></span>From what has been already said, you can
<span id="page_185">p. 185</span> <span
id="viii.ii.lxiv-Page_185"></span> understand how the devils, in
imitation of what was said by Moses, asserted that Proserpine was the
daughter of Jupiter, and instigated the people to set up an image of her
under the name of Kore \[Cora, i.e., the maiden or daughter\] at the
spring-heads. For, as we wrote above, <span
id="fr_1905"></span>[1906](#fn_1905.md) Moses said, “In the beginning God
made the heaven and the earth. And the earth was without form and
unfurnished: and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.”
In imitation, therefore, of what is here said of the Spirit of God
moving on the waters, they said that Proserpine \[or Cora\] was the
daughter of Jupiter. <span id="fr_1906"></span>[1907](#fn_1906.md) And in
like manner also they craftily feigned that Minerva was the daughter of
Jupiter, not by sexual union, but, knowing that God conceived and made
the world by the Word, they say that Minerva is the first conception
\[<span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.ii.lxiv-p3.1"></span>ἔννοια</span>\]; which we consider to be
very absurd, bringing forward the form of the conception in a female
shape. And in like manner the actions of those others who are called
sons of Jupiter sufficiently condemn them.
